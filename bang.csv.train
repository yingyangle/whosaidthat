22472,Penny,"yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the michigan state penitentiary found it. "
23609,Penny,"right. oh, and i told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother."
26219,Penny,it was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
26505,Penny,"oh, my god, you still go left."
25368,Penny,then sit in the car and keep it running.
26601,Penny,"okay. um, you’re lucy, right? i’m a friend of raj koothrappali’s. actually amy recognized you."

24250,Penny,"oh, leonard?"
25789,Penny,he looked at me like this.
26093,Penny,"yeah, if that’s your idea of what’s cool, you should get one."
27334,Penny,"well, you know how they gave me the company car? didn’t make sense to have two, so i sold the other one."
23635,Penny,oh. i was just kind of hoping you were drunk. now we’re back live.
23775,Penny,"yo, raj, talk to me. i’m sorry, just screwing with you. hey, howard, why haven’t you called bernadette?"
24031,Penny,"oh, balls."

23375,Penny,really? are you drunk?
25281,Penny,"all right, fine."
24958,Penny,"what the hell are you doing? howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. you should be ashamed of yourself."
26467,Penny,"well, there’s no right way, sheldon. i already found a few pieces that fit."
26778,Penny,"oh, i have a ton of errands to run. i need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class."
28883,Penny,"great, and just so you know, i’m not getting rid of all your stuff."
25108,Penny,"yeah, it was just sitting on the street. i paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here."
22019,Penny,"uh, no, no not really. listen, didn’t you say you needed some eggs. "
27358,Penny,"well, you know, now that we’re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple."

24353,Penny,sheldon.
26514,Penny,"oh, come on. every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. it’s like, it’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. i mean…"
26184,Penny,"i just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. it’s something we work on in my acting class."
28038,Penny,"okay, well, you’re a grown woman now."
25845,Penny,"no, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game."
26362,Penny,"oh, raj."
22635,Penny,"no danger, look, it’s just me, penny, look, i got to level 25 and reached purple lotus swamp, right?"
23230,Penny,"oh, imagine that."
23855,Penny,what is it?
27213,Penny,those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.
26728,Penny,they must’ve cut it.
26394,Penny,this is ridiculous. why am i upset just because he’s off having a good time?
25291,Penny,"oh, no, no. this isn’t a date, no. right?"
22723,Penny,oh.
29191,Penny,"no, i was going to, but she called in sick. and guess who else called in sick."

24608,Penny,"you know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. shame on all of you. "
29006,Penny,i can’t believe you fit in the crib.
26360,Penny,"can’t stay long. i left sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. he’s gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so… are you okay?"
25552,Penny,"three gr… oh, my god! look, look, amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and i don’t want to lose you out of my life."
22091,Penny,"oh, sure, i see it now, the doppler effect. alright, i’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. "
22528,Penny,"oh, that’s very interesting."
28535,Penny,you don’t know?
23092,Penny,"hey, is sheldon here?"
26750,Penny,"really, let it go."
26844,Penny,okay. there’s one not far from here. come on. let’s go.

24018,Penny,of course i do. you’re an important part of my life and i pay attention to the things you are interested in.
23393,Penny,what?
28647,Penny,really? ‘cause i love it.
22430,Penny,it’s a non-optional social convention.
28833,Penny,your love confuses me. 
25334,Penny,you’re not the guy.
25278,Penny,you’re kidding.
28967,Penny,does the baby have a name yet?
25777,Penny,get out.
25232,Penny,"all right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?"
22179,Penny,then swim to cuba.
22678,Penny,"oh, i’m ready."
24124,Penny,thinly veiled contempt.
28155,Penny,"all right, fine. well, sheldon, i’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of spock? i mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human."
27168,Penny,is he okay?
28216,Penny,interesting. i never told you that.
22469,Penny,"well, it’s got to be one or the other, which is it?"
28682,Penny,"oh, here’s your coat, honey. that’s such a cute jacket. oh god, i feel so bad, i just lied to her."
24439,Penny,"i got it. but what i was going for was, you know, how’s your life?"
25817,Penny,"okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? look, i don’t even know where my relationship is with leonard is right now."
23198,Penny,"okay, yeah, i kind of crossed a line. put him back on."
24972,Penny,pantsuits suck.
27080,Penny,"oh, my. it’s not a contest."
24019,Penny,"um, he was on star trek."
26645,Penny,"look, i get it, i screwed up. is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?"
22864,Penny,he’s having problems with stephanie?
28092,Penny,"well, so do i, but don’t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?"
26010,Penny,"see you, boys. we are going drinking."
26515,Penny,"hey, what’s going on with you?"
24786,Penny,"okay, okay. we get it. you set the scene."
28857,Penny,"so, what’s the deal with your apartment? why’s it taking so long?"
27042,Penny,"all right, sheldon, just ask your question."
26340,Penny,"well, i’m his girlfriend, of course i’m gonna support him."
26538,Penny,what are you working on?
25531,Penny,so ugly. what am i gonna do?
27480,Penny,"well, then, maybe you shouldn’t have named her wheelchair kathy."
24505,Penny,exactly. sometimes you can’t win.
25782,Penny,really?
24247,Penny,i’m not recommending it. i’m saying it already happened.
29007,Penny,our pleasure.
25328,Penny,what’s up?
28729,Penny,"that’s me, i’m her. you know, he didn’t trick me, he just wore me down."
27813,Penny,sure.
28214,Penny,damn it.
26936,Penny,"okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. if i become a famous actress, i’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. they just are."
29295,Penny,what?
26103,Penny,you ever going to sleep with amy?
27494,Penny,"sorry. she’s taken, too."

23397,Penny,"well, some people just can’t handle that kind of relationship."
22817,Penny,what’s this?
25002,Penny,don’t you quit on us!
25685,Penny,hey.
25712,Penny,"okay, you, too."

26849,Penny,sorry.
27585,Penny,please show us?
24004,Penny,did that sound okay to you? do not come in here!
27517,Penny,"you were, but somehow i held myself back."
21955,Penny,"i mean, just because most of the men i’ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn’t mean i should just assume leonard and sheldon are. right?"
22744,Penny,get rid of her how?
23435,Penny,"yeah, i said leonard."
25161,Penny,"handicapped people are nice, leonard. everyone knows that."
27800,Penny,"oh, i guess you’re right. maybe it is the person who asks."
23607,Penny,"no, i thought that would be a nice surprise for her."
25680,Penny,"well, if that’s what you like, i’ll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of ’em."
25736,Penny,that is so sweet.
28124,Penny,and he’s sad about it.
26698,Penny,we do?
22785,Penny,"well, you have three strikes. one, coming in. two, sitting down. and three, i don’t like your attitude."
25203,Penny,"okay, um, hey, god. what’s up? um, i’m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. but no cops. be cool."
26727,Penny,"no, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and mark harmon, but it’s gone."
22621,Penny,"oh, i don’t know. can i see them in another colour?"
26726,Penny,"well, the diner scene. where’s my diner scene?"
24146,Penny,"you’re not gonna leave me alone until i do it, are you?"
26346,Penny,yeah.
22555,Penny,"well, yeah. "
28285,Penny,you’re only hearing that because i cannot roll my eyes any louder.
27951,Penny,"oh, and the fairy tale continues."
28980,Penny,what?
27942,Penny,"amy, don’t be like that."
22156,Penny,"yeah, no, i meant plans to find some place to live. other than with me, not that i don’t love having you, but it’s… a little crowded."
26576,Penny,when did i have pistachios?
29438,Penny,thank you.
29131,Penny,"you know, it’s no big deal. i can put up with anything for three days."
25808,Penny,maybe he didn’t notice.
22757,Penny,"you sound just like the cable company. all right, so, shh, tyra banks is about to kick someone off  america’s next top model."
28003,Penny,"yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you."
28036,Penny,your shoes.
27911,Penny,"maybe. but this isn’t about them, it’s about us."
26892,Penny,"well, i’ll have you guys know i turned down a part in a movie last week."
27401,Penny,"well, with all the new stuff i bought for work, i needed to make room in my closet."
28608,Penny,she would find it perfectly acceptable. you guys saw it. we bonded.
22471,Penny,"you know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it."
22514,Penny,"right, thanks."
24722,Penny,"well, i’m not getting in bed with him."
25958,Penny,"no. that’s not true. there’s french, there’s italian. no, you’re right, it’s the best."
24941,Penny,"well, then, good news. today’s the day a girl’s finally going to touch you in your little special place.  now give him his stuff back."
24162,Penny,tell me about it.
22637,Penny,"okay, well can we go talk in the living room?"
26909,Penny,i know. thank you.
27418,Penny,"here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with amy?"
23311,Penny,"uh, hey, maybe when you’re done with her printer, you could set up mine. you know, like you promised a week ago."
26284,Penny,"sheldon, you big weirdo, i want you to know that i love that you’re in my life."
23970,Penny,"sheldon, this is ridiculous."
23625,Penny,of course not.
26911,Penny,"sweetie, i know you’re trying to make me feel better, and i love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and i kind of hate you. this isn’t your car."
21972,Penny,"uh, six thirty’s great."
27621,Penny,i can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp.
27254,Penny,"oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor."
25946,Penny,"far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. look, sheldon, your problem is not wil wheaton, okay? your problem is the way you treated amy."
22666,Penny,sit over there.
22125,Penny,"ha-ha, there goes your head again."
25933,Penny,"yeah, right."
23485,Penny,"well, they’re pretty tasty."

28693,Penny,"well, it was an accident.i am so sorry i lied."
23163,Penny,thank you.
23498,Penny,uh-huh.
27007,Penny,"but i realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. so, i asked the director why and he says, it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape."
26887,Penny,"you know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she…"
25688,Penny,"oh, my god, howard. that’s the most beautiful thing i’ve ever heard. and it came out of you."
28844,Penny,thank you.

26531,Penny,"oh, no."
24076,Penny,okay.
28419,Penny,"okay, everybody, sheldon is gonna come back out, but i think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra nice, okay?"
24000,Penny,"think it through, leonard."
23652,Penny,i told you about him.
25932,Penny,"no, i’m a terrible waitress, remember?"

27271,Penny,"what? oh, why would he say that?"
23606,Penny,"she’s adorable, howard. i think you’ll like her."
24131,Penny,i’m not sure.
29134,Penny,"you know, maybe it won’t be that bad. leonard says it’s really mainstream now. comic books aren’t just for sad nerds any more. i mean, it is still a key part of their demographic."
22178,Penny,there’s a can in the fridge. 
23549,Penny,"oh, man, did the kiss army repeal don’t ask, don’t tell?"
24616,Penny,"okay, what about your friend amy?"

27000,Penny,wait. what’s wrong with geology?
24626,Penny,"no. wait, wait, does it?"
22330,Penny,"you know, i’m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?"
29375,Penny,what the hell’s going on? 
25733,Penny,"oh, my gosh, that’s awful. the other kids make fun of you?"
24223,Penny,sheldon’s churro on my shoes.
29502,Penny,"because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and i just bit the fingers off your receptionist."
25249,Penny,i never gave you a friendship bracelet.
22038,Penny,"alright, thank you, and sheldon."
23243,Penny,ew.
21892,Penny,"oh, yeah, a lot of people think i’m a water sign. okay, let’s see, what else, oh, i’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, i love steak. "
22809,Penny,how the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
28479,Penny,but i could get her.
26238,Penny,"hey, it’s still early. why don’t we go back and have that party?"
24116,Penny,"yeah. yeah. no, no. um. so, it’s getting pretty late. we should probably go to sleep."
21945,Penny,i don’t get it.
24544,Penny,"oh, gee, dad, leonard can’t stay. he just dropped by to say hello. thanks for stopping by, sweetie. i’ll see you later.  bye."
23959,Penny,"well, it creeps me out."
25838,Penny,"all right, that’s enough. "
27021,Penny,what the hell? what? she’s not working late.
27775,Penny,what is the harm if i audition?
26519,Penny,okay.
26957,Penny,"i kind of did. the part in that awful horror movie i passed on came back around. apparently, it’s mine if i want it."
29499,Penny,"soft kitty, warm kitty."
27136,Penny,not a chance.
24813,Penny,hey!
29238,Penny,i think it’s bert.
29350,Penny,"hi, hey. i’m running out to the market, do you guys need anything?"
26850,Penny,it wasn’t cheap. it was free.
25588,Penny,you don’t have to check with me. do whatever you want.
23947,Penny,"oh, sorry, sweetie, i can’t help you till i’ve had my coffee."
23475,Penny,is that true?
25418,Penny,what does that mean?
25966,Penny,"no, he’s not. we’re just friends. look, is this gonna be a problem? because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work."
27145,Penny,"well, leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple."
23496,Penny,yeah. we waited a few months. we can wait a few more days.
28310,Penny,"oh, sheldon, you don’t even like it there."
25704,Penny,"okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that."
28089,Penny,are you doing okay?
28463,Penny,no. you know what? don’t. don’t. let’s let them think they’re getting away with it.
22626,Penny,"oh my god, a treasure chest, i’m rich!"
26493,Penny,sheldon’s spot. the coin is in your spot.
25448,Penny,is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?
25033,Penny,"yeah, i know, right?"
24106,Penny,what’s the matter?
29208,Penny,yeah.
29168,Penny,you didn’t do anything. it’s sheldon.
26521,Penny,okay.
22418,Penny,anguish?
27028,Penny,what’s wrong?
24190,Penny,"so, um, was leonard okay with you coming over?"
24081,Penny,sheldon tried to take the ring and i punched him.
24321,Penny,"oh ha-ha, oh. that’s amazing."
28467,Penny,"yeah, that’s pretty good."
22712,Penny,"all right, come on sheldon."
22234,Penny,"you should just talk to him, i’m sure you guys can work this out. "
24869,Penny,"um, no."
23453,Penny,is he serious?
23329,Penny,oh boy.
23276,Penny,leonard?
28606,Penny,you really think we made a mistake?
26438,Penny,oh. 
25073,Penny,why not? 
29079,Penny,"okay, that’s the one to beat."
28705,Penny,"oh, hi."
24922,Penny,did you know last weekend priya took leonard rollerblading at the beach? can you believe that?
27473,Penny,"oh, come on, they don’t hate you, all right? they’re just a little intimidated. all you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are."
26529,Penny,"yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do."
23610,Penny,i’m kidding.
25786,Penny,i don’t really know how to say this.
23725,Penny,"okay, can you drive me?"
22548,Penny,"well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and i didn’t want him to think i was some stupid loser. "
28538,Penny,"yeah, come on, raj."
25646,Penny,i dunno. i just think it’s a waste.  relax. i’m just looking at the box.
23936,Penny,"ugh, what can you do? here. "
22441,Penny,"oh, okay then this one. "
25243,Penny,"look, come on, amy, look, let us make it up to you. we’ll have a girl’s night, we’ll do whatever you want."
25839,Penny,yep!
29298,Penny,"oh, stop it, he’ll be fine."
27173,Penny,i haven’t been on a job interview in years. i’m really nervous.
29300,Penny,sorry.
24877,Penny,i’m not going out with him. he can sleep with whoever he wants.
23264,Penny,"come on, but if you don’t stay awake we’ll never finish in time."
26533,Penny,"okay, sheldon, what happened between you and amy?"
26504,Penny,not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
22938,Penny,"you know, i have always wanted to see a big science lab."
26970,Penny,really?
28324,Penny,what is that?
28591,Penny,"uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything i say?"
28288,Penny,"and in double-blind studies, placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting fda approval for placinex. they started taking it, stopped worrying."
22709,Penny,"i said, get out."
26663,Penny,"oh, that’s great. you must be thrilled, "
21886,Penny,"so, sit next to me. "
25121,Penny,"what’s the gist, physicist?"
24473,Penny,bernadette or the troll?
23022,Penny,"oh come on, really? "
23720,Penny,i know. i slipped.
26486,Penny,"okay, the clue must be in the bag."
28458,Penny,"oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things."
27099,Penny,you can’t do that. he’s with me.
26866,Penny,"ooh, this one looks nice."
21951,Penny,stay away from me.
25847,Penny,"okay. just for the record, i have never entered a wet t-shirt contest. i’ve won a few, but that’s just because i spill when i’m drunk, so…"
29061,Penny,"leonard, if you’re mad about this, just tell me."
22228,Penny,"oh yeah, me too. zip it, lock it.  put it in your pocket. so you and leonard…"
27160,Penny,"he’ll be okay. you taught him well, padawan."
26877,Penny,yes.
27314,Penny,it’s my boss. they moved my field ride up to monday.
28942,Penny,little lower to the left. a little more.
28304,Penny,"ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night."
28523,Penny,"well, why the hell did i memorize the pledge?"
26425,Penny,ah.
26036,Penny,"oh, i just didn’t know if you meant me or alex."
25407,Penny,"okay, he is not dying."
28922,Penny,amy wants me to have it.
27548,Penny,really? want to go to hawaii?
25422,Penny,"leonard, you know i will always have feelings for you."
29514,Penny,"oh. it’s bernadette. she says they’re running late. the baby threw up on howard, and then howard threw up on howard."
28077,Penny,my dad killed my pig with his tractor.
23382,Penny,"so, how did the beautiful mind of sheldon cooper forget his key in the first place."
23248,Penny,"uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. i mean, it kind of looks like the myspace page of a 13-year-old girl."
23874,Penny,"sure, sure."
28737,Penny,"of course. you can stay in leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place."
22591,Penny,"okay, where is this coming from?"
25754,Penny,"ew, why?"
29127,Penny,"wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there."
24103,Penny,where the hell d’you find that?
23662,Penny,"oh, you are such a…  what the hell is he doing?"
24707,Penny,"red leader, i’m really sorry."
22080,Penny,fine.
26378,Penny,"all right, let’s just get this stupid game over with."
27189,Penny,"me, too."
24155,Penny,"okay, i’m sorry, honey, but the wesley crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like wesley crusher."
25330,Penny,"god, are you trying to make amy jealous?"
24028,Penny,no! it wasn’t a betrayal. it was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license. i already have to buy my insurance from this place in the cayman islands.
22695,Penny,"oh, dear god."
29034,Penny,when was the last time you got a massage?
26808,Penny,to be cool? yeah.
27949,Penny,"oh, my god, would you stop bringing it up?"
24477,Penny,"okay, i will think about it."
23734,Penny,"no… no… oh, that’s cute."
28135,Penny,amy.
22854,Penny,"well, aren’t you sweet?"
24945,Penny,"alright, well great seeing you."
24852,Penny,"okay, i’m not upset about leonard and priya."
22252,Penny,"alright, remember when i auditioned for that workshop production of rent, but i didn’t get it and i couldn’t figure out why?"
23467,Penny,"okay, bye.  means i wish you weren’t going."
29324,Penny,the point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.
27882,Penny,"uh, hello."
22848,Penny,"so, this wasn’t the awkward part?"
23535,Penny,why not?
28720,Penny,"yeah, i mean, i could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party."
27040,Penny,"oh, i think i see our next stop."
23791,Penny,you want me to throw him out?
28097,Penny,"okay, look, we don’t need to rush into anything. all right? maybe instead of leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we’ll sleep over there, and sometimes we’ll sleep over here."
25765,Penny,"oh, my god. sheldon?"
22413,Penny,i know. i want to talk to you. 
22711,Penny,"you’re hurting the people around you, sweetie."
22546,Penny,no.
26067,Penny,uh-uh.
26661,Penny,"mmm, you clearly haven’t been with me at mardi gras."
26649,Penny,"because you wouldn’t shut up about it. when i called him, he had nothing to do, so i just thought it would…"
27503,Penny,hi. ready to go?
25554,Penny,"okay, look, i didn’t want to say this, but the real reason i took the painting down was because it made bernadette very jealous."
29460,Penny,mrs. cooper. hi!
26301,Penny,any chance we could plug it into the potato?
24205,Penny,"yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels."
27872,Penny,and that made her angry?
23774,Penny,"hi, guys."
23035,Penny,just do it!  get inside and shut the door.
24413,Penny,"oh. wow. good job. okay, um, can you do this?"
25586,Penny,"okay.  okay, yep, we’re all done now. it’s just, it’s good. let me just take that away from you. okay."
24083,Penny,"no, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. nothing you do is silly to me."
24497,Penny,"i’m sorry, honey, i don’t know millilitres."
24236,Penny,"oh, they’re not my friends."
28648,Penny,your parents are old. anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. go to sleep.
27741,Penny,"guys, if i wanted to hear people be bitchy, i’d go to my real salon."
23371,Penny,i’ll just go look for it.
25667,Penny,"so, i hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight."
28502,Penny,and then you got arrested.
24400,Penny,so you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
25585,Penny,"ha, told you. okay, i’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go."
22974,Penny,"you know, since i moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded."
25551,Penny,"amy, come on…"
28169,Penny,don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
23508,Penny,it was… okay.
26665,Penny,"actually, i get what he’s saying."
29389,Penny,hi guys. looks like you’ve been to the renaissance fair. i’m hoping.
24662,Penny,that’s what it says on the packet.
28301,Penny,"hey, so i saw a movie trailer the other day. how could batman possibly fight superman? i mean, isn’t that dumb?"
23083,Penny,he was drunk.
24466,Penny,"oh, no, not at first. right after i pointed it out."
27313,Penny,"oh, you will. that’s why they give you the bucket. uh-oh."
22485,Penny,"well, i went over to mike’s to make up with him."
28166,Penny,"oh, i don’t want credit for that."
26198,Penny,"oh, for god’s sake, just come to the play."
23796,Penny,"oh, come on, it’s fine. we’ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style."
25193,Penny,are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry howard wolowitz?
25896,Penny,"no, it’s not a big deal. just taking a class at the pasadena community college."
25711,Penny,yeah.
25864,Penny,not really clear on what he does.
28907,Penny,"well, and what happened to you?"
25028,Penny,you mean when he was little.
29420,Penny,"oh’ my god, she didn’t!"
26275,Penny,"see? i wish i had some of that fire in my life. i mean, i want to care about things and get excited like you guys."
23501,Penny,leonard?
22923,Penny,i don’t know. ‘cause it’s christmas?
27354,Penny,control issues?
22054,Penny,we really shouldn’t be standing here. 
23114,Penny,"oh, well, i’m an actress."
26526,Penny,how do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
23019,Penny,and you moved in anyway?
23926,Penny,yes?
28782,Penny,"all right. well, let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down."
23556,Penny,"oh, am i talking too much? i’m sorry. zip."
21913,Penny,"really, why?"
26557,Penny,"boy, bernadette is gonna love this."
25550,Penny,i don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.
28245,Penny,do you even like the beach boys?
28879,Penny,"sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours."
22459,Penny,keep walking.
24751,Penny,"yeah, i saw those. they were funny. i printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge."
25645,Penny,i cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.
27844,Penny,"oh, sweetie, it was the best speech i…"

26759,Penny,did you seriously just say um?
28622,Penny,no.
26243,Penny,you can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?
28866,Penny,"yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while."
22094,Penny,kurt!
22267,Penny,"howard, wait. sheldon, i think we should tell them."
28030,Penny,"oh, it’s good. i just wish leonard would work up the courage to tell sheldon he’s moving in here."

28493,Penny,"hey, let’s light a fire."
24153,Penny,i don’t get it.
23557,Penny,yes please.  you’ll never guess who they got to replace you at work…

27411,Penny,"well, who cares what i think? what do you think?"
25917,Penny,what?
25358,Penny,both.
25452,Penny,"no, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. that’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag."
23520,Penny,what do you have a safe deposit box for?
23932,Penny,"that’s, like, in 45 minutes."
27626,Penny,get out.
29304,Penny,"okay, a simple yes will do."
24445,Penny,"well, what’d he say?"
22299,Penny,no.

24234,Penny,"oh, no, no, no, no. i’m not flabbergasted. i’m puzzled. yeah, let’s go with puzzled."
27608,Penny,"i don’t know what to tell you. i mean, why don’t you talk to her?"
25067,Penny,can i stay at your place for a few nights?
24084,Penny,"fyi, this is a bag from victoria’s secret."
28422,Penny,"okay, while they get the cake, sheldon, i just want to say, i hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug."
27632,Penny,i don’t want five dollars. i want my dignity.
22448,Penny,"okay, so we’re getting this one?"
24659,Penny,and leonard didn’t want to work with you? imagine that.
29145,Penny,"amy, do us a favour, please drive."
22840,Penny,screw him. you’re fine.
27798,Penny,no.
24774,Penny,"okay, you know what? let’s just try a different improv. uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass."
27894,Penny,"well, you want a date, pick a date."
26436,Penny,"yeah, no, no, no. you know what, sheldon, it’s okay. you don’t have to go into the bathroom."
28633,Penny,"no, of course not."
27090,Penny,"uh, pretty good, actually."
27027,Penny,shut up.
28845,Penny,"i assume we’re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows."
27922,Penny,"you know, can i ask you a question?"
23693,Penny,"it doesn’t matter why he told me. it’s true, isn’t it?"
25016,Penny,"okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we’re going."
29167,Penny,"wait, is anything gonna jump out of that."
23153,Penny,"oh, thank you. you are a lifesaver."
22283,Penny,"leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. you’re gonna do okay. "
28528,Penny,"uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting."

23528,Penny,"oh, hey."
26266,Penny,i liked it. i’m excited.
25904,Penny,i don’t want you to make a big deal out of it.
22018,Penny,thank you.
26365,Penny,that’s just the booze talking.
25627,Penny,"and that’s how a girl makes a scene. i’m sorry, sweetie. you’re right. you deserve your weekend. come on, amy, let’s go."
27524,Penny,"uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. hey, can i ask you something?"
22437,Penny,"well, it’s a fun sweater, it’s got a bold geometric print. "
28646,Penny,‘cause they both turned their phones off.
24208,Penny,"well, all i know is he says they hurt his feet."
27840,Penny,add a belt and i’ll take you some place nice.
22231,Penny,well how do you feel?

22001,Penny,"yeah, me too. um, good night.  leonard?"
29013,Penny,"oh, you always know what not to say. i just, i can’t believe you did all this."
29335,Penny,"well, sometimes women don’t care. sometimes it makes them want a guy even more."
23738,Penny,"yeah, great."
23825,Penny,twenty six hundred years?
28146,Penny,i would.
26188,Penny,"oh, hi. what’s up?"
22632,Penny,"thank you, i really appreciate this."
27819,Penny,it’s called an evening look. i’ve never been to new jersey before.
22967,Penny,sheldon! what did you do?!
29058,Penny,"he didn’t know it till he was cuffed, but yeah."
29025,Penny,nothing.
25763,Penny,"that’s the thing, i’m not. i’m not unhappy at all. it’s just, i don’t know, i, i’ve been in love before, but it felt different. but maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. do you ever feel that way about howard?"
28282,Penny,thank you.
25001,Penny,"look, just find out what’s up with this trip to india."
23807,Penny,"um, actually, can we do it in private?"
26947,Penny,hi.
27399,Penny,"oh, great. i don’t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper."
26061,Penny,"all right. well, you guys have fun. i guess i’ll see you sunday night."
25319,Penny,"well, ladies, we killed the bottle."

25236,Penny,"okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it."
26960,Penny,"okay.  sometimes i feel like i can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then i see these bananas and i just want to eat them and then kill people. what am i gonna do?"
29110,Penny,"yeah, women do like a man that can support himself."
24772,Penny,"yes. look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes."
25912,Penny,leonard. it’s eight a.m. it’s like the middle of the night.
25697,Penny,"okay. me, me, me. ready?  leonard, i am your father."

28483,Penny,"uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?"
26985,Penny,"oh, come on, try me."
23741,Penny,"then, maybe you should let it go."
26482,Penny,"okay. oh, it’s a bowling alley."
23991,Penny,"oh, for god’s sakes."
26269,Penny,i’m sorry i called it cute. let’s watch another one.
24906,Penny,"okay, i’m not moving anywhere. what the hell is this all about?"
26567,Penny,no. something’s going on. what’s wrong with it? i remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.
27139,Penny,"no, keep your money."
28639,Penny,"you know what, flash your lights. let him know it’s you."
26054,Penny,"i know, right? watch this. molecules."
24291,Penny,sheldon! play nice.
22100,Penny,"oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. "
24976,Penny,"hey, i know, let’s take sheldon dancing."
27067,Penny,toy story 3?
26144,Penny,"um, i think so. why?"
29062,Penny,he’s my brother. i didn’t think i needed your permission.
22777,Penny,"well, what a thrill."
26068,Penny,"that is an amazing idea. okay, how many of these have i had?"
25199,Penny,"oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster. sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. now i’m going out tonight. would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit i’m going to wear?"
25533,Penny,"all right, it’s got to go."
29342,Penny,"so, you guys work with leonard and sheldon at the university?"
27727,Penny,it does have a camera in it.
29097,Penny,ew.
25229,Penny,"so, bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?"
28009,Penny,i never thought about it like that.
28006,Penny,"you know, i fell in love with leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys i was used to dating. i mean, i knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met."
22836,Penny,"so, who is she?"
25816,Penny,there’s nothing to be brave about. everything’s fine.
24086,Penny,"sheldon, congratulations. brought you cheesecake from work. you know, ’cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it."
29125,Penny,"come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy."
26333,Penny,"oh, i don’t know. remember what happened when i took care of your goldfish?"
29113,Penny,yeah.
23184,Penny,"okay, now that i’ve been completely insulted, have a good flight."
22797,Penny,well?
22636,Penny,yeah. leonard gave me an emergency key.
29223,Penny,"okay, it’s just a notebook, what’s the big deal?"
24974,Penny,"sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?"
22271,Penny,"no, look, sheldon’s cousin leo escaped rehab, and he’s in a motel 8 at long beach, the whole family’s going out for an intervention. leonard is driving sheldon down there to help him through this because he’s such a good man."
23990,Penny,better acoustics for your throat singing?
28112,Penny,i told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
28509,Penny,"well, how much you got in there?"
22689,Penny,"i don’t know, maybe it’s the local cuisine. okay, well, it’s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and i’m going to leave so, namaste.  and fyi, you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law."
29069,Penny,you gave me a bill at the end of every month. 
26127,Penny,what did i do?
27683,Penny,it’s getting creepy again.
21907,Penny,okay. thanks. 
26729,Penny,"this doesn’t make any sense. i mean, i, i thought i did a, a really good job, i… excuse me."
29205,Penny,"well, sweetie, that’s crazy."
22311,Penny,and there was no-one there to take care of you?
28927,Penny,why don’t you keep it?
27757,Penny,whoa.
24123,Penny,"it’s always nice chatting with you, sheldon."
22996,Penny,what about her?
22000,Penny,"oh, no, it’s fine, you got most of it out the window. "
25737,Penny,go sports?
26175,Penny,"what, what do you mean? are you breaking up with me?"
22506,Penny,"well, choose."
24387,Penny,really? your deeply religious born-again christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
22431,Penny,"okay, let’s do this, um, i will drive sheldon to get a present, and howard, you need to get rid of leonard for about two hours. "
27150,Penny,"he can take care of himself. look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle."
24354,Penny,can i ask you a question?
22244,Penny,"no, no, i didn’t say better, i said less stained. "
23171,Penny,"there, nice and comfy cosy. zero, zero, zero."
22736,Penny,"okay, well, thanks for the nightmares."
25220,Penny,did you guys do it?
24736,Penny,thank you.
26609,Penny,"oh, that’s right. nachos and a turkey club."
25169,Penny,"i can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. oh, here she comes."
26308,Penny,"oh, it’s not so bad. you lost money, you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. i mean, that’s vegas, you nailed it."
26984,Penny,is something bothering you?
22020,Penny,"oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then. "
23377,Penny,"mmm, what smells so good?"
22811,Penny,never.
27790,Penny,"uh, no, i actually came to talk to you."
25185,Penny,"wait, what is going on?"
27088,Penny,"yeah, he is pretty stupid."
22456,Penny,"i’ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, i’ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who’s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat. "
26413,Penny,thank you. how about a hug?
22308,Penny,"sheldon, you are a grown man, haven’t you ever been sick before? "
27185,Penny,"um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? no. okay, i’m really sorry for wasting your time."
27709,Penny,so what do you think?
27831,Penny,just open it.
25769,Penny,talk about what?
24375,Penny,what? where did you get 171 men?
26592,Penny,"no, if it was a spider, lenny would’ve flipped out."
22860,Penny,this is a door knob.
27761,Penny,i only figured that out because i’ve never heard of any of them.
29379,Penny,"um, that one. "
24957,Penny,"hey, 16 wants to order appetizers."
24424,Penny,"so, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? only fourteen hundred bucks."
23194,Penny,"okay, i got a box, but there’s no key in here. just letters."
28187,Penny,"oh, there he is."
28696,Penny,what are you doing?
28638,Penny,"well, go faster. you’re losing him."
27459,Penny,aw.
26115,Penny,"well, you know what they say, if it ain’t broke."
25735,Penny,this is great. what’s the occasion?
29399,Penny,"okay, you guys, look, i know this is none of my business, but i just, i have to ask, what’s sheldon’s deal?"
25419,Penny,you are so funny.
22707,Penny,no.
25956,Penny,relax. he’s just a friend. we’re doing an oral report together. he’s really nice.
24167,Penny,"yeah, i got it."
27495,Penny,"certainly doesn’t feel like it, does it?"
22691,Penny,thanks for the update 
21880,Penny,"this looks like some serious stuff, leonard, did you do this?"
26953,Penny,i’m liking my odds here.
22479,Penny,yes. you’re right. i should just say i’m done with him. 
22727,Penny,"oh, are you here to see leonard?"
28898,Penny,could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?
26390,Penny,i can’t believe it. all this time i’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. and you know what the worst part is?
24175,Penny,"okay. are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?"
24683,Penny,"okay. so, the usual, with extra spit on sheldon’s hamburger."
25136,Penny,"okay, i’m not driving him."
27086,Penny,you know what? fine. do whatever you want.
22216,Penny,"so, you know, isn’t there maybe some way you and sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing."
26771,Penny,"great, because i’ve been thinking, if i really want this acting thing to work, i need to focus all my energy on it. and to do that, i should quit waitressing at the cheesecake factory."
29465,Penny,who do we love?
24943,Penny,going to see leonard?
26835,Penny,"aw, jewellery. oh, my god, lakers tickets?"
29029,Penny,this is exactly why i didn’t want to talk about it.
23357,Penny,hi. what would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
28250,Penny,i’m really happy you and amy are back together.
25787,Penny,okay. here goes.
27925,Penny,"no, i don’t want there to be secrets between us."
25949,Penny,"welcome to long island, tex."
22280,Penny,"yeah. hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?"
24339,Penny,probably not.
28147,Penny,"oh, what’s that ring box?"
22778,Penny,"oh, jeez, you’ve got to be kidding me."
21975,Penny,"okay, whatever, it sounds like fun."
23627,Penny,"well, ’cause they’re not genius scientists."
23285,Penny,"well, i’m sure the new people will be just as quiet."
29216,Penny,"oh, yeah. so, leonard tells me you’ve had a busy day."
25792,Penny,m-hmm.
29126,Penny,"it’s not that i want to go, i just think it’ll make leonard happy. and if i have to watch him squeeze into an ewok costume, so be it."
28213,Penny,who’s my favorite backstreet boy?
21863,Penny,i said not now. 
29440,Penny,what now?
24695,Penny,yay!
29439,Penny,"oh, my god, are you okay?"
23739,Penny,"ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve."
23039,Penny,well the “check engine” light is fine. it’s still blinking away. it’s the stupid engine that stopped working. it cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
26222,Penny,"what if i ask sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?"
29037,Penny,what are you doing here?
25134,Penny,thank you all for this high honour.
27308,Penny,nah.
25011,Penny,what are you doing at work these days?
22468,Penny,"okay, so i pick good guys, but turn them into losers. "
24293,Penny,"no, just keep walking."
26299,Penny,"but if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? is it a trick clock or a trick potato?"
22944,Penny,"oh, shut up!"
23481,Penny,"oh, hon… uh…   soft kitty, warm kitty…"
22362,Penny,"you’re joking, right?"
29297,Penny,"oh, sweetie, you might not live that long."
27426,Penny,aw.
22729,Penny,"sheldon cooper? tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?"
25421,Penny,whoa. not so fast.
24328,Penny,"ah, du-du-du-du-du. how did they meet?"
23711,Penny,"buy him the robot, leonard."
24134,Penny,you are. you don’t get to decide when i’m ready to say i love you!
26692,Penny,"sure, why?"
23595,Penny,ba-eye.
22290,Penny,i… i don’t…
25335,Penny,i call everyone sweetie.
28016,Penny,that sounds nice.
26256,Penny,"absolutely not. help me out here, i can’t afford another demerit."
28365,Penny,won’t make us any younger.
23532,Penny,"so, we’ll just be friends."
23398,Penny,excuse me?
29475,Penny,"thanks, cole. see you at school."
28185,Penny,"hey. so, where are they?"
27371,Penny,why would you say that?
26280,Penny,"no, i’m serious. look, i’ve always had these plans. i was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited about."
28161,Penny,do you know what that means?
25766,Penny,what are you doing in my bedroom?
26377,Penny,"okay, i get it, i get it. you are an emotionless robot."
24227,Penny,good. i’m glad.
23786,Penny,"yes, but i don’t think she wants to see you."
22575,Penny,"yeah, why not?"
27672,Penny,"well, that’s always been a secret. not even amy knows."
26573,Penny,"good, i’m just having little trouble with the glue."
24955,Penny,in confidence!
26480,Penny,shut up. i solved it.
23347,Penny,leonard?
23631,Penny,you wanted to meet my friends.
23681,Penny,do you want lemonade?
26783,Penny,yeah. i’m just returning my uniform.
28139,Penny,yes. don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.
26583,Penny,"raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds."
25633,Penny,"well, i was thinking about sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food."
27053,Penny,"hey, guys."
25367,Penny,"come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!"
26356,Penny,"oh, leonard."
22540,Penny,"alright, i heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl. "
23300,Penny,"oh, they’re all up there, huh? hmm, typical."
29314,Penny,yeah. do you think living with amy has somehow stirred up sheldon’s sexual appetite?
24206,Penny,"oh, well, then you, you do it."
21937,Penny,yeah?
27591,Penny,"cooper told amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. he asked her if she had any questions. all she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer."
27828,Penny,ooh.
28293,Penny,"you know, i used to wear tank tops a lot. that was a big selling point."
23141,Penny,get out!
23781,Penny,"hey, i did not settle for leonard. i mean, obviously, he isn’t the kind of guy i usually go out with, you know, physically."
23207,Penny,what is it?
27664,Penny,"well, i can’t read people’s minds. actually, that’s not true, i can read men’s minds, but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing."
26240,Penny,"damn, i forgot to feed him. and that i had him."
28955,Penny,"oh, you sexy, wheezy little man."
26961,Penny,"no, come on. this is serious."
24459,Penny,"well, i’d ask you guys if you want dessert, but i know sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on tuesdays. and even if raj wanted something, he couldn’t tell me. howard won’t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. and leonard’s lactose intolerant, so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal."
24747,Penny,what?
25895,Penny,"no, no, it’s…"
25984,Penny,"okay, howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos."
28391,Penny,what’s it say?
24735,Penny,right. still mad at me about that?
28861,Penny,"okay, are you done? bernadette told me your apartment’s ready."
24509,Penny,"what? sheldon, you can’t reprogram people."
24015,Penny,"um, can you give me a hint?"
27651,Penny,"question one. given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
29364,Penny,let’s go-oh-oh ou-oooo-ut tonight. i have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight. 
27285,Penny,"no, that won’t work."
21989,Penny,"okay, well, you know, it’s just me. i’m still getting over this break-up with kurt, and this thing with doug would be just rebound sex."
24158,Penny,yeah.
22345,Penny,"leonard, you said i only had to ask questions. "
27620,Penny,son of a bitch.
27413,Penny,"well, now i can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch."
26153,Penny,nothing. nothing.
23533,Penny,come here. 
24961,Penny,"okay, listen, just because howard and bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around."
26319,Penny,"ooh, i have an idea. since it’s not happening any time soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?"
28752,Penny,"you’re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other’s personal space."
25994,Penny,"okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. it’s right up there with icky and get it away. now pick one up."
22519,Penny,"i’m sorry, i don’t get the point. "
22488,Penny,how could he do that.
23608,Penny,"i just told her you’re an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages…"
21969,Penny,"okay, well, thank you, again."
24369,Penny,"i myself grew up in nebraska. small town outside of omaha. you know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs."
28961,Penny,"okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. you can just say actress."
24347,Penny,"okay, fine. when’s the date?"
22539,Penny,"sheldon, may i ask you a question? "
29181,Penny,don’t you want to get dressed first?
27692,Penny,"again, it was miniature golf."
24441,Penny,"so this is the plan? from now on, we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the shamy?"
29296,Penny,amy’s got some news.
25034,Penny,we were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
23447,Penny,for three months?
26742,Penny,"wow, thank you."
26292,Penny,"so, do you do a lot of appearances like this?"
23374,Penny,great.
25938,Penny,i had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
22927,Penny,"oh, hey, leonard. ooh, are you okay?"
23412,Penny,"come on, do i really have to?"
22266,Penny,uh-huh!
26109,Penny,wow. where are you going to go?
26300,Penny,"arthur, are you okay?"
25837,Penny,soon.
23358,Penny,"oh, hellblazer. what’s this about?"
22742,Penny,"you know, the only way i could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls."
27685,Penny,can you believe it’s been eight years?
27639,Penny,how’s howard holding up?
21959,Penny,leonard.
29204,Penny,"yeah, that’s rude."
26882,Penny,"of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life."
27393,Penny,move it.
23415,Penny,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
22436,Penny,"sheldon, a gift shouldn’t be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn’t buy for themselves."
23654,Penny,he’s not some guy. he’s my friend.
29237,Penny,the end.
24546,Penny,"yeah, okay. the thing is, i kind of told my father we got back together again."
29305,Penny,"okay, listen to me. your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. it’s not like you two are very physical."
24204,Penny,"oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me."
28291,Penny,i just meant a question about the drug.
29004,Penny,you poor things you must be exhausted.
22601,Penny,"okay, let me put it this way, if you’re really leonard’s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with."
24107,Penny,"here, drink this. it’ll relax you."
25652,Penny,"you know, i paid a lot for this. let’s take it over there and show him."
22775,Penny,"come on, i touched one onion ring."
28870,Penny,okay. that’s enough. you know what? what is going on?
27297,Penny,"yeah, and leonard and i are engaged now, and i’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us."
25739,Penny,"gosh, i worked my ass off today. this is exactly what i needed."
22212,Penny,"well, where you going, just put them on. "
29419,Penny,"hey, leonard, can i talk to you for a sec?"
29458,Penny,sittin’ pretty.
27490,Penny,you’re just gonna leave him here?
24217,Penny,"i know, i know."
28322,Penny,"shake it, baby."
27486,Penny,"so, dr. koothrappali, long flight?"
24215,Penny,we’re home.
23697,Penny,"oh, now i need your permission for that, too?!"
23640,Penny,"on earth, we say thank you."
22222,Penny,the… the eighth grade?
25066,Penny,somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. we may have to drive awhile. 
21881,Penny,wow.
22068,Penny,"really, oh yay!"
23021,Penny,"well yeah, sure. when you put it that way. but it all worked out, right?"
27060,Penny,i have a confession to make.
28082,Penny,i’m proud of you. you’re taking this really well.
26403,Penny,"okay, that, that’s a good start, but i was thinking maybe something a little more personal."
25005,Penny,"oh, please, you’re not that kind of person."
22879,Penny,mm-hmm.
27159,Penny,"leonard, we can’t protect him forever."
22084,Penny,"well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven. "
23051,Penny,great. i hope i’m a waitress at the cheesecake factory for my whole life.
29066,Penny,he would get his own place.
26541,Penny,"aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?"
24588,Penny,"no, no. but in this case, yes."
24606,Penny,"yeah, yeah, me and zack again."
28387,Penny,"wait, i remember that. hang on. you did it at our place?"
24809,Penny,"oh, please, i recognize the walk of shame when i see it. all you’re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it."
26349,Penny,"raj, i’m so sorry."
24279,Penny,are we ever going to get to the elevator?
24407,Penny,i don’t have one.
27633,Penny,"i know, it’s so insulting. at one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box."
28532,Penny,"all right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night."
25111,Penny,i went into this marriage with so much hope.
29254,Penny,"well, and his fiancée will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding."
22670,Penny,"no, it’s okay, between  "
22876,Penny,"well, then who did?"
28011,Penny,uh-huh.
22165,Penny,"alright, now sheldon, you and i are about to have a problem. "
22366,Penny,"not done. by the time i finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. yeah, that’s right, i’ve lost an entire day’s pay thanks to this… this…"
22940,Penny,"um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket."
28675,Penny,"you know, when leonard’s feeling anxious i make him take a long walk."
24773,Penny,what?
29322,Penny,do you really think there’s reason to worry?
28673,Penny,is he? i never noticed.
23244,Penny,i’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.
29083,Penny,"okay, stop that. no more preschool talk. tonight is about having fun."
23046,Penny,"really? i mean, are you sure?"
22180,Penny,"okay, raj, here you go. alright, who’s next?"
21909,Penny,"um, okay. can i ask you a favour."
27424,Penny,"aw, i know i wasn’t into this before, but i’m so glad i get to take you to your first prom."
23454,Penny,"all right, i’ll see what i can do. so, three months at the north pole. wow, that is awesome."
21980,Penny,so are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
22730,Penny,sheldon cooper?
28017,Penny,"oh. oh, my god, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me."
23801,Penny,"oh, great selection, great prices."
29130,Penny,"well, it’s no different than when sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm."
26934,Penny,"so, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?"
29082,Penny,no. she’s busy. you call howard.
26434,Penny,"no. no, no, no. you know what? the toilet’s been doing that. i called the building manager, so…"
25640,Penny,"oh, that’s great. let’s open it up and put him in there."

24049,Penny,"oh, nice."
29293,Penny,"once again, you got me."
29036,Penny,"well, yeah."
23427,Penny,really?
29275,Penny,you want to talk?
24538,Penny,"okay, look, just because we’re not seeing each other anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. i mean, leonard’s a great guy."
27927,Penny,okay.
23815,Penny,"oh, come on! a smart guy like you, it’ll be a challenge. you can make it like an experiment."
25698,Penny,"oh, mm. hey, you know how we’ve been taking things slow?"
26363,Penny,"i know how you feel. i miss leonard, too."
23583,Penny,do something.
25293,Penny,"oh, yeah. sure. just one sec?"
25630,Penny,"okay, you’re right, i eat your food a lot. how about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want."
22862,Penny,no.
29433,Penny,but it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. totally.
21979,Penny,why?
25767,Penny,"how did you even get in, you weirdo?"
24653,Penny,aw.
27412,Penny,"ugh, thanks a lot."
27079,Penny,what’s two to one?
24056,Penny,yeah?
26073,Penny,"ooh, thor! he’s hot."
22329,Penny,"i don’t understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place? "
25876,Penny,"ooh, low-techie-techie. so, what are you working on right now?"
22106,Penny,"gah, i’m not perfect."
25062,Penny,no.
28560,Penny,"okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye."
27857,Penny,"hey, look at that. you both believe in jewish bearded guys."
26990,Penny,i’m talking about other guys.
28765,Penny,even more not what you think.
25703,Penny,who says something like that right in the middle of sex?
24318,Penny,all right. pass the soy sauce.
23763,Penny,"oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?"
26216,Penny,"sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with amy?"
22160,Penny,she’s not my friend. friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty. 
22676,Penny,"oh, raj, look at you!"
28797,Penny,what about the girl behind the counter?
23552,Penny,"they’re gonna get beaten up at walgreens. oh, sorry, sheldon, i almost sat in your spot."
29308,Penny,"i want to, but i don’t think i can."
23661,Penny,"oh, now i’m a child? well, at least i’m not an idiot anymore!"
25760,Penny,"no, he’d just take it the wrong way."
28179,Penny,"damn, you’re sneaky."
26824,Penny,really? is that how you talk to your mother?
26334,Penny,"sheldon, sweetie, shut up."
24195,Penny,"why did you ask if i had one, too?"
24842,Penny,"oh. hey, sheldon. what can i get ya?"
29247,Penny,"well, congratulations."
26796,Penny,"okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?"
25331,Penny,"okay, listen to me. playing games is not gonna help get amy back."
25617,Penny,"all right. let me give you a little girlfriend 101. usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after sheldon hits puberty. so, i’d say give him the silent treatment."
26474,Penny,riddle me this…
27375,Penny,hi.
25273,Penny,okay.
24010,Penny,"why don’t i pour it in your lap, and you can tell me."
28756,Penny,good night.
26442,Penny,what?
28685,Penny,hi.
28552,Penny,"yeah, give her a break from, well, come on."
22891,Penny,really? what was your first clue?
22600,Penny,"you must know that if leonard and leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it."
26261,Penny,i feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.
24900,Penny,"so, how’s the food here? oh, wow, that is really, really good. oh, i’m sorry. you guys are on a date. we can hang out anytime. have fun."
26617,Penny,"sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins."
26839,Penny,that is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.
28714,Penny,"it’s okay, i’ll still go."
24797,Penny,"okay, i guess we’re improvising now."
28777,Penny,mm-hmm.
26007,Penny,of course you did. your hands are softer than veal.
29279,Penny,"no, i know you’ll try, but it’ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and i’m just gonna stay where i’m at for now."
28982,Penny,hi. there’s the little family!
25151,Penny,"okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat."
21901,Penny,"oh, i’m so sorry, i’m such a mess, and on top of everything else i’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work."
23312,Penny,"well, they’re all still up there."
23999,Penny,i know! i went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
23477,Penny,"oh, the poor thing."
23880,Penny,i’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. another round for me and my homegirl.
22732,Penny,"oh, come on, we’ll be quiet."
23979,Penny,we’re going to disney world and ride the matterhorn?
22044,Penny,"oh, wow, a girl scientist. "
27860,Penny,"yeah, and you certainly don’t have to earn my love."
22994,Penny,"okay, come on, that’s not fair."
24541,Penny,"you know what, i don’t want to play anymore."
22462,Penny,happy birthday anyways. 
28156,Penny,"i’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else."
22554,Penny,"oh sheldon, please, look, i’m asking you as a friend. "
22947,Penny,"yeah. oh, can i drive the motorcycle?"
24140,Penny,"again, i’m sorry."
27403,Penny,what kind of teenager did you think i was?
27686,Penny,i can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life.
25076,Penny,"so, hi. what’s up?"
26265,Penny,so you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?
26047,Penny,what’s that?
26213,Penny,unless you want to be cinderella.
21960,Penny,"guys, seriously, i grew up on a farm, okay, i rebuilt a tractor engine when i was like twelve, i think i can put together a cheap swedish media centre. "
23223,Penny,and you know about that stuff?
28335,Penny,uh-oh.
23699,Penny,"hey, why don’t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?"
25940,Penny,you could have a long island iced tea.
22240,Penny,you had a lucky hunch. 
24962,Penny,"all right, try thinking about this. sheldon and amy had sex."
25059,Penny,"coming. yup, that’s good. wine glasses should have handles."
26789,Penny,thank you. i needed to hear that. why can’t leonard understand it?
29273,Penny,yeah.
24362,Penny,"um, what is that scent you’re wearing? it smells great."
25080,Penny,thank you.
25263,Penny,"well, i’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. you want to go?"
25818,Penny,"well, of course he’s desirable. i mean, he’s great. he’s smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries."
26962,Penny,less than i was making at the cheesecake factory.
25523,Penny,"a little something? oh, it… what, this is huge."
22378,Penny,really?
28090,Penny,"well, come on, he’s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. he’s fine."
23257,Penny,"okay, well, i’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order."
24560,Penny,"curtis, and i’m pretty sure he was joking."
25131,Penny,what’s wrong?
25471,Penny,even doctor who.
23281,Penny,the people upstairs are moving out.
21935,Penny,"yeah, yeah, if it gets here and i’m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment."
25748,Penny,girls.
25094,Penny,"okay. um. well, i already talked to raj, but i wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything."

22365,Penny,"it was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son."
27687,Penny,that’s it. that wasn’t so bad.
27501,Penny,"oh, sheldon, we didn’t bring any."
22103,Penny,"yes it is. that’s why i broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. "

26805,Penny,oh.
28521,Penny,"well, guess i gotta drink."
28690,Penny,"hmm. well, i guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights."
26553,Penny,"okay, that’s just the plot for dirty dancing. what else would you love? other than being lifted over patrick swayze’s head."
29472,Penny,"oh, good, your power’s out, too."
28904,Penny,it’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
24764,Penny,okay. one of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. so why don’t we try some improvisation?
22748,Penny,"oh, man."
26545,Penny,"oh. i know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?"
25244,Penny,"with-with loofah mitts, no hands."
23362,Penny,"okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture."
23098,Penny,"yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right."
28920,Penny,"oh, no, no, those hooks are gone."

25707,Penny,"you can’t take something like that back. i mean, what are we even supposed to do now?"
24919,Penny,all right. see you later.
29092,Penny,"no, of course not. i just, i didn’t think it would make me have all these feelings."
25183,Penny,"here you go, boys. i’ll pick it up when you’re ready."
27008,Penny,"oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. i have to go to the gas station across the street. i mean, i was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there."
27864,Penny,"yeah, me, too."
27667,Penny,"well, now i wish i had the ability to make that stuff easier for you."
26624,Penny,i was 16 in nebraska. what do you think?
23904,Penny,why are you being such a jerk?
27278,Penny,we weren’t lovers. come on. everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. we got drunk and fooled around. why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?
24040,Penny,"oh, gee, thanks, leonard. that didn’t occur to me. if he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail."
25057,Penny,"i listen. i have no idea what it means, but i listen. to friendship."
23639,Penny,there’s some in the fridge.
24290,Penny,oh! that’s very cool.
26738,Penny,"yes, honestly."
28510,Penny,"my god, leonard, do you know what i could do with that kind of money?"
25081,Penny,"oh, god. did you pull some weird indian crap on me?"
28886,Penny,we turned your room into a sex dungeon.
26199,Penny,"i think you have a great capacity for devotion. you’ll be lonely when she passes on, won’t you? i understand what that is."
23274,Penny,come on. what about the living organism of the workforce and the american spirit and jiminy crockett at the alamo?
24800,Penny,"oh, howard, i can’t believe bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey."
25569,Penny,so did i win or not?
24468,Penny,"howard, if you want my help, i’ve got to know what happened."
27848,Penny,"you know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. maybe i should get her something so she warms up to me."
22995,Penny,"fine, i’ll go over there tomorrow."
28784,Penny,just as challenging?
27350,Penny,"you know what, that’s great. i love that."
28773,Penny,"okay, i’m confused. which one is mr. robot?"
26615,Penny,which is?
26616,Penny,"oh, my god! is that sweater made of bees? come on, take it off. i won’t tell."
22612,Penny,no! i am frustrated because i am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. 
24385,Penny,you’re still on that?
23082,Penny,yeah. he got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.

28718,Penny,i suddenly wish sheldon was here.
25613,Penny,"whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. hold on. "
26244,Penny,"wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the cheesecake factory."
26267,Penny,what do you want from me?
28664,Penny,pretty good. i actually just got assigned a much better territory.
22499,Penny,i was just wondering if i could talk to you? it’s about leonard.

22268,Penny,"there’s no symposium, leonard lied to me, isn’t that right leonard. "
26393,Penny,"no. come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain."
26154,Penny,it’s just this guy i used to date.
27590,Penny,"it stung amelia when he spoke to her this way. in her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man."
25591,Penny,"whu… the entire weekend? you mean i wouldn’t see you at all? but i ju… no, no, i knew what i was getting into. you can’t put a saddle on leonard hofstadter. oh, my, is it getting hot in here? ay, papi."

22119,Penny,"no, yeah she’s definitely a whore. i mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at… where’s howard?"
26164,Penny,"we were; it’s just, it’s not fair, okay? they’re bad people. it’s not supposed to end happy for them, it’s supposed to end happy for me."
25176,Penny,"okay, come on. you know you can do better."
26915,Penny,i wouldn’t be so sure about that.
27836,Penny,what’s taking so long?
22403,Penny,"blah blah blah, a typical taurus. so, seriously, are we going to see you saturday?"

27616,Penny,now open your hand and let it go.
29121,Penny,"wait, wait, who’s gonna break it to the penguin?"
27498,Penny,it’s kind of boring. although it did get exciting for a minute when amy inhaled a wool ball. how much longer do you think you’ll be?
24287,Penny,"oh, but what about the party?"
28491,Penny,"you know, we could still go. a little rain isn’t gonna kill us."

29253,Penny,"what? he loves you, okay? and he’s interested in your work. you could talk about the infinite perspective… i swear i know it."
27120,Penny,"sweetie, you can be any pastry you want."

28549,Penny,mm-hmm.

24663,Penny,"no, sorry."
26754,Penny,"no, it’s not okay. look at me, okay? i took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and i’m still doing it. i can’t quit, because guess what? i can’t do anything else. and i finally get my big break, and it goes away. i’m such a mess."
23266,Penny,leonard?
27781,Penny,"well, how much do you owe? maybe i can help you out."
23502,Penny,it’s weird.
24968,Penny,"oh, i’m sorry, honey, i’m meeting amy and bernadette for dinner. but you’re welcome to tag along."
29185,Penny,"oh, that’s beautiful. what does it mean?"

28333,Penny,"yeah, right in there. she ate it and everything."
28805,Penny,"well, what happened with your dad?"
22638,Penny,why not?
29202,Penny,i probably should have spit out my gum first.
25973,Penny,"leonard, why do you always do this? listen to me, you’re the one i’m with. you know i love you, so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy."
26940,Penny,"ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. so, why do you think that?"
28671,Penny,oh.
23206,Penny,what?
25455,Penny,what do you mean?
27679,Penny,sorry.
26352,Penny,"okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…"

23890,Penny,get out here! your mommy wants to talk to you!
26932,Penny,"of course not. if i became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me."
29518,Penny,"you love her very much, don’t you?"
27439,Penny,okay. and sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool?
23547,Penny,"fine, whatever. are you finished?"
24574,Penny,"okay, sheldon, you don’t have to do this because leonard and i are not…"
27897,Penny,"all right, well, i want it in a church."
23069,Penny,"going home, where i won’t be interrogated like a criminal. i forgot my fortune cookie."
22793,Penny,"there you go, quesadilla, salad, there’s your pizza, and thanks to sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side."
23057,Penny,"thank you, leonard. what’s my share?"
23154,Penny,"yeah, you know the sad thing is, it’s really not. ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?"
25047,Penny,hit me.
24145,Penny,i don’t know.
27695,Penny,hi.
24125,Penny,got it.

29368,Penny,"here you go, good luck, bye."
28353,Penny,"yes. oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and i just…"
29318,Penny,"no. come on, it’s sheldon. nothing is gonna happen."
29282,Penny,"hey, uh, so i’ve been thinking about it and i want to take the job."
23934,Penny,"he doesn’t need to know what we were doing, leonard."
26787,Penny,because leonard just pissed me off. am i being an idiot or not?
26399,Penny,thanks.
25182,Penny,what? no!
23897,Penny,agreed.
22466,Penny,wait. 
28750,Penny,"i know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key. "
24825,Penny,"hi. so, um, priya, you’re a lawyer, right?"
24114,Penny,oh. oh. thank you.
28856,Penny,"well, you’ve lied to sheldon."
27214,Penny,"uh, no. i can keep going."
27964,Penny,can you?
27984,Penny,that’s great.
24712,Penny,really?
25071,Penny,"you know, i don’t even know what the point of me staying in l.a. is. i haven’t gotten a single acting job since i moved out here. the closest i came was last month, i got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial."
25734,Penny,"uh, i don’t know, it’s still kind of weird. we haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex."
27660,Penny,"well, not to steal from the bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good."
24071,Penny,"yeah, sometimes i don’t listen, sometimes i just watch your jaw go up and down."
25225,Penny,"all right, then break it off with the new girl."
29153,Penny,"yeah, there’s room in the bed by sheldon’s feet."
23180,Penny,"when i go, i usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars."
22503,Penny,no.
28571,Penny,we didn’t.
26629,Penny,"sheldon, you can have a nice thanksgiving anywhere. i spent one in vegas."
25261,Penny,"haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?"
24322,Penny,does nasa know you’re using that thing as a napkin holder?
26761,Penny,"no, forget it. i take it back. offer’s off the table."
29042,Penny,we’re not getting divorced.
22991,Penny,i turn into a bear?
24485,Penny,"you know, you look thirsty. i brought you some iced tea."
25998,Penny,"hey, don’t name him. just jab a hook in his face."
27392,Penny,"okay. nope. that’s it. we are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out."
22728,Penny,dr. sheldon cooper?
23006,Penny,"howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?"
24363,Penny,"ah. well, your hair looks very nice."
23162,Penny,"oh, come on.  there, butt print."
29291,Penny,good for you. 
28517,Penny,"well, it’s not what i want to do."
28202,Penny,yep. what’s the code?
22490,Penny,"you know, just once, i would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me. "
24949,Penny,"oh, damn it. i told amy that in the strictest confidence. boy, some people are such blabbermouths. well, whatever, i’m sure bernadette can do better."
24979,Penny,take us to a place we can waltz.
24661,Penny,milk.
25758,Penny,"yeah, sure, of course i love him."
26141,Penny,"this old guy was choking on his food, and i saved his life."
28302,Penny,"no, no, no, no, no. i’ve seen that movie. it’s called iron man."
26002,Penny,"what, never?"
22117,Penny,he really needs to dial it down.
26189,Penny,you need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?
27277,Penny,why would you say that?
28863,Penny,"oh, don’t worry, i won’t."
26577,Penny,"hey, guys, what do you think?"
27510,Penny,"yeah, today amy and i are deciding what we’re all gonna do."
25255,Penny,"oh! bernadette, you look beautiful!"
25806,Penny,"who i hope for her sake is not captain hook, so… who are you calling?"
29269,Penny,and zack’s engaged. leonard has no reason to feel threatened.
22101,Penny,"hey, i just wanted to make sure you’re okay."
27011,Penny,"‘cause you’re trying too hard. you need to do something else, get your mind off it."
21882,Penny,"so you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys."
23476,Penny,why did you have to make him happy?
27373,Penny,"okay, what’s the big deal? look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, i don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. i mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the ac in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls."
22789,Penny,what? i’m not going to apologize to that nutcase.
23678,Penny,"okay, fine, it’s soup and a small sandwich. is that what you want?"
28145,Penny,"okay, enough about the napkin. what else you hiding in there?"

24685,Penny,the what?
29289,Penny,and when? but also where?
22861,Penny,"sheldon, would you like to come in?"
24037,Penny,but it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. totally. a teardrop rolls down my cheek?
25539,Penny,"ah, okay. let us take you off the wall. out of sight, out of mind. i wish."
22282,Penny,"this is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now i get to watch you watch me."
22421,Penny,"okay, here’s the deal, you either help me throw leonard a birthday party or, so help me god, i will go into your bedroom and i will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. and on one of them, you won’t know which, i’ll draw a tiny happy face in ink. "

23832,Penny,"no, you just suck at teaching."
23806,Penny,it’s not about shoes.

24501,Penny,"all right. sheldon, what’s on your mind?"
24553,Penny,"come on, honey, not in front of my dad."

22521,Penny,"okay, so you’re saying i should go out with leonard. "
26753,Penny,"oh. sorry, i meant to. anyway, um, i was just upset with myself. i wasn’t mad at you. i just feel like everything is falling apart."

27563,Penny,"so, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?"
25911,Penny,"thank you. now behave yourself and eat your dinner. maybe later, if you’re lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl."
25897,Penny,"it’s just one history class. look, i didn’t finish college, so i thought i would give it a try."
26664,Penny,"he’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?"

25776,Penny,"okay, honey, i have a lot to figure out, and until i do, you are not to say a word to leonard. do you understand?"
25362,Penny,"oh, my god, that’s perfect. ‘cause i have so many clothes i don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and i go shopping to buy more stuff and i have no place to put it. this will totally fix that."
26700,Penny,doing laundry?
28794,Penny,"oh, please, you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?"
26386,Penny,leonard?
24656,Penny,"okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the internet to find out where you can buy them."
29156,Penny,what? is it another video of him and his dog lady-and-the-tramping some spaghetti?
27596,Penny,yes.
25858,Penny,"i’m, i’m sorry, amy. you were saying something about howard’s foreskin?"
22669,Penny,"gosh, raj, do you think you’ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?  okay, well, i’ll just, um, go eat by myself."

24248,Penny,you know what? i’m just gonna take the bus to work.
24589,Penny,"no, it was great. he just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level."
28289,Penny,"uh, do you have any questions?"
24672,Penny,"no, no, no. you know, they have suffered enough. everybody’s suffered enough. the thing is, you’re going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this."
28450,Penny,"hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, i’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? he doesn’t think that’s funny."
23317,Penny,yes.
24581,Penny,okay.
28691,Penny,"uh, you know, when i was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her."
26271,Penny,"oh. well, that’s like my high school, too. but instead of a curse, it was crabs."
24311,Penny,"oh, god!"
24450,Penny,no!
25190,Penny,"no, i was there that day. sheldon threw his back out handing him that book."
28255,Penny,come in.
28836,Penny,that did not clear things up.
29015,Penny,oh. 
23977,Penny,"okay, i’m starting to think swiss is key here."
28524,Penny,"well, why are you fighting him on this?"
22668,Penny,i thought the blowers were more sanitary?
25879,Penny,wow. that is amazing.
26177,Penny,"yeah, you got it."
26129,Penny,"no, i don’t want to break his heart. i love him. this is just happening too fast."
22547,Penny,"okay, okay, you know, i get it, leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college. "
23691,Penny,"oh, really? well, then, do me a favour and tell leonard that he can drop dead!"
21914,Penny,"wow, cool tiger."
28636,Penny,"well, why is he turning here? the restaurant’s the other way."
23366,Penny,"wow, zork. well, you guys have fun."
26666,Penny,"it’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever."
23337,Penny,excuse me?
29111,Penny,"all right, hang on. we can figure this out. let’s just go over your expenses. how much is your rent?"
22193,Penny,"oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty. "
27219,Penny,"what, you? really?"
24203,Penny,nope.
26351,Penny,"i’m gonna miss you, too."
26875,Penny,"come on, that is ridiculous."

29213,Penny,uh-oh. someone’s got two dates to the nerd prom.
23745,Penny,it’s right there.
24191,Penny,"well, good."

24558,Penny,"oh, see?"
27058,Penny,"no, he blew up the death star. why do i know this?"
25612,Penny,"wow. yeah, b-beginner’s luck. so, now i will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. so, yeah, okay, now i’m gonna drink this entire cup and then i’m going to drink another one… okay, seriously, stop. what the hell?"
23383,Penny,oh-oh. i just remembered where the emergency key is.
26748,Penny,what? how did you manage that?
24794,Penny,"all right, come on, just try it my way. pretend you’re sad to see him go. i’m gonna lead you in. his unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. that’s your cue."
28642,Penny,"yeah, i’m gonna call bernadette and see what’s keeping them."
29519,Penny,"yeah, sure, why not?"
28123,Penny,"okay, let me see. nope, nope, nope, oh, he’s cute."

23420,Penny,"fine. oh, hey, can i ask you something?"
23212,Penny,"sheldon, don’t you get it? if this takes off, i won’t have to be a waitress anymore."
27323,Penny,to the walk-in closet? sure.
22123,Penny,"oh, what, what, what? "
26518,Penny,i’m so sorry. i never should have read that book. you know what? you want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
24536,Penny,truth.
23492,Penny,"well, leonard, aren’t you going to do something?"
22102,Penny,i’m so sorry about what happened.
22679,Penny,"um, yeah, why what’s wrong with it?"
25148,Penny,"yeah, my bikini region is fine."
22883,Penny,roommate? you guys are living together?
27719,Penny,"yeah. we could give it to sheldon, and tell him william shatner painted it."
24903,Penny,"no, it’s all right. walk me down. so, what’s up?"
23696,Penny,"no, i’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!"
22504,Penny,"okay, so, here’s the thing. i guess you’re aware that leonard asked me out. "
24021,Penny,"um, uh, stan lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?"
26575,Penny,"yeah, i’m just making a mess."
25535,Penny,"well, i guess i could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy."
27225,Penny,aw.
28905,Penny,"ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?"
24491,Penny,"hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says i can’t actually give nachos away. so, just take that when you’re ready."
27416,Penny,"great, how?"
25869,Penny,"no, i know. it’s long overdue. so, what ya doing? better not be building a robot girlfriend."

27845,Penny,"leonard, what time does your mom’s plane get in?"
27065,Penny,i can’t do it with you staring at me.
28738,Penny,"no, not at all."

27379,Penny,oh. that’s why you were mumbling mississippi.
24514,Penny,"well, i’m watching it now. why would i want to see it again on friday?"
22104,Penny,"well, i ran into him last week and, he was…  just, all apologetic, about how he’s changed, he was just going on and on and i believed him, and i’m an idiot because i always believe guys like that and… i can’t go back to my party because he’s there, and i know you don’t want to hear this and i’m upset and i’m really drunk and i just want to… "
25030,Penny,"you want to talk about crazy mothers, leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up."
26689,Penny,really? you don’t sound so sure.
22889,Penny,"you’re going to go down swinging, huh? all right, well, we got your body lotion, your instyle magazine, your jewellery box."

26345,Penny,"i, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, i’m happy for you. because that’s what friends do."
22946,Penny,it’s not an experiment! you saw what happened last night.
24677,Penny,"yeah. yeah, that was my plan. all right. come on. let’s go."
29055,Penny,"you don’t have a problem with this, do you?"

26513,Penny,"yep. hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys."
25332,Penny,"all right, honey, let me tell you a story. there was a guy i liked, and i never told him how i felt. eventually, he started going out with someone else, and i always regretted it. do you see where i’m going with this?"
25893,Penny,"i thought we said in the car, no accents?"

22574,Penny,"oh. oh, well, good for him. yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don’t you just go to a movie or something?"
22963,Penny,"okay, all i’m giving you is the napkin, sheldon."
25266,Penny,what is that about?
28403,Penny,"oh, poor thing."
23155,Penny,"oh, no, thanks. i’m from nebraska. when we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. "
22882,Penny,"you know, she seems very nice."
28852,Penny,"you know, once, i proposed to him."
28977,Penny,do boys have flowers?
28594,Penny,"or i invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine."
22549,Penny,"you know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates. "
28039,Penny,why? i can do it right here.
26446,Penny,"no, he doesn’t."
27223,Penny,you guys are going out two nights in a row?
29283,Penny,"oh, so there’s no job?"
26996,Penny,"oh, leonard was telling me about dark matter, but i didn’t really understand it."
27668,Penny,"wow, i just felt this wave of affection for you."
28265,Penny,"uh, i don’t know. it was just a thought."
24986,Penny,"oh, that’s nice."
26468,Penny,"ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. all right, come on, that’s where we have to go."

22364,Penny,"zzz-zz-zz-zz! second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so i had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely armenian family, who insisted i stay for lunch. "
26239,Penny,"this turned out pretty well, huh?"
26995,Penny,can you keep him quiet? maybe jangle some keys in front of him?
28674,Penny,"all right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. get him some anti-anxiety meds."
26906,Penny,"how? unlike me, you have a job. i’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like i will be for the rest of my life."

27937,Penny,"no. no, i want to. look, we’ve put this off long enough. let’s do it."

21978,Penny,"no, six thirty’s great."
29410,Penny,"oh, good morning."
27564,Penny,"yeah, i listen to what you say. you’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium."
28308,Penny,"oh, that could be fun. but just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?"
27141,Penny,"if you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?"
29361,Penny,hey guys.

24350,Penny,"well, no, not per se, but…"
25018,Penny,"okay, you know what? you are unbelievable. you buy all these superhero t-shirts, but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room."
25772,Penny,"okay, what did amy tell you?"
26136,Penny,"oh, don’t get all huffy. you’re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if i was ready."
25807,Penny,what?
25519,Penny,no and no. everything okay with you and bernadette?
22078,Penny,"as usual, i’m not following."
23123,Penny,"oh, my god. what happened?"
22782,Penny,"yeah, you do that."
28052,Penny,you’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about sheldon?
27638,Penny,i really thought he was gonna say let it go.
22896,Penny,are you guys having problems?
28268,Penny,i know. then you’ll finally stop talking about it.
28901,Penny,"so, were you turned on even a little bit?"
23843,Penny,"really? that’s it? well, that doesn’t sound so complicated."
27448,Penny,"okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass."
27509,Penny,"yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director’s commentary."
27113,Penny,no. i need to start making some smart decisions.
21783,Penny,not pregnant. yes!
24898,Penny,"hey! look at leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. way to go, priya. for once, he doesn’t look like a mannequin in the boys’ department. hey, did he tell you i saved the silk shirt?"
27443,Penny,he’s still in surgery.
26614,Penny,sheldon’s not here. why don’t you take the sweater off?
27855,Penny,really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. i think.
24778,Penny,fine. what would you rather do as a scene study?
23778,Penny,different how?
23729,Penny,no one’s saying that. let’s go.
28224,Penny,does it really say that?
26336,Penny,"you know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first."
22934,Penny,"so, are you and leonard working on an experiment together?"
25965,Penny,don’t be like that.
25857,Penny,"i do, it’s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. a lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy."
21916,Penny,"oh, i don’t think i’ll be able to stop thinking about it."
29394,Penny,"sheldon, what do you want."
25282,Penny,"no, i was thinking how come they get to leave and i can’t."
24324,Penny,who’s amy?
22409,Penny,so you’ve really never had a birthday party? 
27710,Penny,"i’m not even sure why we were out of breath. uh, i mean, did we move at all?"
27702,Penny,you went to the dirty store without me?
27284,Penny,how? you can’t force someone to like you.
24078,Penny,what ring?
24790,Penny,just keep going!
22301,Penny,you sound funny.
25721,Penny,"hey, i know tons of people who got married in vegas."
26612,Penny,"okay, you guys are overreacting. raj is gonna appreciate how i had his back."
24750,Penny,"okay, where is this coming from?"
29219,Penny,"all right. well, we’ll just pretend that you didn’t catch a cold watching frozen."
29316,Penny,really? all i got from leonard was the toblerone bar had nuts.
25361,Penny,"okay, come on, i don’t even have my own house, i’m going to build one for someone else?"
24011,Penny,"yeah, well, i’m sick, too."
22568,Penny,"so, it’s fine with you if i’m not smart. "
28979,Penny,"oh, boy, i think it’s about to get bad."
22780,Penny,"ooh, strike three."
25379,Penny,"honey, she’s upset. you’re her boyfriend. you have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by."
26236,Penny,"yeah. and i said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might as well not do it."
24416,Penny,"oh, let me help you up."
24453,Penny,i hear you broke up with amy.
28911,Penny,there you go.
22002,Penny,was this supposed to be a date?
27400,Penny,"ah, you guys are the best."
24595,Penny,"oh, no. why?"
27928,Penny,"look, i’m not happy this happened, but i think i can get past it. i mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing."
23216,Penny,"sheldon, i’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? i just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life."
29441,Penny,"ah, it’s okay."
22855,Penny,"yeah, i think she’s pretty safe."
26907,Penny,"i’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game?"
23368,Penny,"um, you know, it’s kind of early. do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?"
27723,Penny,"no, no. i’m gonna cheer you up. here we go."
27437,Penny,"yeah, i watched. it was like the scary boat tunnel in willy wonka."
26512,Penny,really? are you sure about that?
27909,Penny,"yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes."
24337,Penny,why not?
28170,Penny,"come on, amy, show us the dress."
22351,Penny,"i’m settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. okay, are you ready?"
22791,Penny,"look, i like hanging out with you guys, but i’m not going to apologize for something i didn’t do."
26809,Penny,"oh, guys, this is really sad. and in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago."
22061,Penny,"oh, hey leonard."
22968,Penny,"leonard, look! sheldon’s hugging me."
24860,Penny,"okay, look, if i agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about leonard and priya?"
23805,Penny,"howard, never let her go."
27322,Penny,"all right, guys, look, i would love to go out, but i’ve got to get this done, okay? so have fun at the club. and if you get in trouble, find a policeman. and if he’s taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman."
22368,Penny,"oh please, it’s not a time machine, if anything it looks like something elton john would drive through the everglades."
25401,Penny,i don’t know.
24933,Penny,"no problem. so, leonard, i think it’s interesting you didn’t call your girlfriend to come get you."
26077,Penny,stupid?
28540,Penny,what’s up?
24382,Penny,"no! no! no. let’s just all finish our dinners, okay?"
24269,Penny,"a little bit. okay. let me get this straight. you move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this joyce kim, and you still stay?"
24320,Penny,really? they’re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
27249,Penny,"look at you, talking sports."
27085,Penny,no.
24694,Penny,"you know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don’t piss off the people who handle the things you eat."
22257,Penny,do you have any idea what time it is? 
22225,Penny,hey sheldon! 
21992,Penny,emotionally.
27724,Penny,i am taking you shopping.
24843,Penny,where are all your friends?
23568,Penny,"oh, just a big misunderstanding. you know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. anyway, i was thinking i’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited."
27408,Penny,"okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be."
23211,Penny,"no, i’m making flower barrettes. see? i call them penny blossoms. i made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. then i showed some to this lady who runs a shop in old town. she sells cards and homemade jewellery. she said she wanted to sell them. i said okay, and in one week, i made a $156."
25248,Penny,hi.
24342,Penny,what do you want?
23541,Penny,"sorry. okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?"
28206,Penny,"yes, i do."
28621,Penny,"okay, so it’s not a legal ceremony, it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it."
23544,Penny,"okay, so kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband’s name is sandy, right? so get this, her replacement is a woman named sandy whose husband’s name is kim."
22034,Penny,"hi, you guys ready to order?"
23080,Penny,"oh, that’s nothing."
22310,Penny,studying abroad?
28527,Penny,"mm, i think so. dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead."
22543,Penny,"so, do you think that if leonard and i keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me. "
23637,Penny,i know. i just need you stop talking.
25674,Penny,"okay, show’s over."
26279,Penny,"see, that’s the kind of passion i didn’t think i had. but then i realized i’m passionate about you."
24099,Penny,"yeah, that’s when i buy shoes. now, let’s see what we’ve got. ooh! this is nice."
24150,Penny,"i’m sorry. you know what i’m talking about, though."
26429,Penny,"okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. keep the change."
24875,Penny,"oh, big deal. not knowing is part of the fun."
25745,Penny,"no, we don’t! come on in!"
27941,Penny,"well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing."
23288,Penny,the horror!
23050,Penny,i’m regretting this already.
22512,Penny,"but on the other hand, if things don’t go well with leonard, i risk losing a really good friend. i mean, i guess he’s not looking for a fling, he’s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, i don’t know, like you would say light years. "
24866,Penny,more or less.
24418,Penny,thanks.
24494,Penny,"you know, they have a really nice bar over at the olive garden."
24775,Penny,"you bet. i had dreams, you know. i was gonna be famous. show everybody back home i could be someone. now look at me. want some?"
23156,Penny,you think he’ll notice?
28983,Penny,mm.
28376,Penny,"no, no, come on. come on, you’re not gonna get fat. you’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever."
25142,Penny,"ames, hi. how was the wedding?"
23517,Penny,schnapps.
28424,Penny,but now you’ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.
24839,Penny,great.
27436,Penny,hi.
24480,Penny,"hey, how are we doing over here? can i get you something to drink?"
29177,Penny,what? why?
23657,Penny,do you have a problem with justin staying with me?
28807,Penny,and you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?
25892,Penny,"no, sexy cop. slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges."
26173,Penny,"obviously, i have some commitment issues."
26303,Penny,"vegas, here we come."
22616,Penny,what are you doing?
23856,Penny,"oh, sure, sure, yeah. very christmassy."
22278,Penny,by the end. yeah. 
22445,Penny,no? 
24152,Penny,the wesley crushers?
22025,Penny,"oh, i don’t know sheldon, it’s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun i had today. "
21991,Penny,"no, it’s usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it."
27733,Penny,"wow, it looks really pretty in here."
29408,Penny,"hey, sheldon, are you and leonard putting up a christmas tree?"
22324,Penny,you deliberately stuck me with sheldon. 
27293,Penny,hi.
22407,Penny,"what was it called, “i hate my son and that’s why he can’t have cake?” "
26793,Penny,and now we go to reverse warrior.

24055,Penny,"i’m sorry, stuart. thanks anyway."
26015,Penny,"raj, you’re a great guy, you’re in a bar full of single women, let us help you."
24704,Penny,i don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. someone should stand up to him. what’s he going to do?
25584,Penny,"okay, what do you think?"
27915,Penny,what?
29422,Penny,"yeah, freaky."

25132,Penny,"wait. get up, get up!  swear you won’t tell sheldon what happened!"
28668,Penny,hey. is everyone getting to know each other?
22939,Penny,since always.
28340,Penny,"well, i have broken up with my fair share of guys. i mean, how many times did i break up with leonard?"
27912,Penny,"and you know what the best part is? we took our time. i mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets."
25695,Penny,"b-before i do it, if you’re a cop you have tell me, right?"
28655,Penny,"yeah, plus if you leave, alfred will know he got under your skin."
28321,Penny,and now you see the problem.
24964,Penny,i-i guess they just figured it out at some point.
29371,Penny,"okay, new contest. "
23573,Penny,"ugh, fine. but the man really needs to work on his girl issues."
23612,Penny,what?
23956,Penny,"oh, you’ve been falling all night. you’re used to it."
23928,Penny,"sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?"
22749,Penny,"really? well, then will you explain it to me?"
26662,Penny,"hey, what’s with all the yelling?"
23103,Penny,it’s out of order.
28972,Penny,"yeah, but he doesn’t live here anymore."
22851,Penny,"yeah, leonard told me."
21985,Penny,ah. well i’m sure things will pick up. 
29084,Penny,"okay, give. can you guys handle this or not?"

26799,Penny,"okay, wait. what are we doing?"
22433,Penny,entertain them.
23870,Penny,"oh, it’s not a problem."
25496,Penny,"because last month, i sent the electric company a starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra."
28230,Penny,"well, i’ve never been friends with any of my exes."
26685,Penny,"okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down."
24507,Penny,right there with you.
25306,Penny,"oh. okay, i see. so while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two star trek uniforms?"
28299,Penny,"okay, if you think it’ll help. oh, just don’t make it placinex. i do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage."
26582,Penny,"oh, that’s amazing,"

29195,Penny,"well, i hope not. i just hate when people play those kinds of games."
23919,Penny,"oh, no, no, no, crystals don’t work."
25925,Penny,"hmm, how about, gee, penny, you’re smarter than i thought. you may be the one in school, but i’m the one who learned a lesson. i’m so stupid, penny. duh."
27143,Penny,"well, i’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule."
24602,Penny,exactly.
26148,Penny,this place is really beautiful.
26603,Penny,"yeah, this is none of my business. but why did you break up with him in an e-mail?"
27493,Penny,like what?
28174,Penny,"yeah, come on, tell us more."
26584,Penny,"hey, arthur. how are you?"
27343,Penny,"sweetie, i can buy my own stuff. i have a good job now."
27805,Penny,"well, kind of. but now i get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect."
28562,Penny,"oh, yeah."
23960,Penny,just answer the phone.
24376,Penny,"whoa, wait, wait, wait. i did not start dating at 15."
23887,Penny,"actually, i’ve only had the cheesecake. one more time. you know, leonard did not want to tell you we were dating."
24359,Penny,fair point.
25369,Penny,"come on, yoga top. mama needs a new yoga top."
25439,Penny,"well, what if we do go out and i do something stupid and dump you again?"
24314,Penny,are you drunk?
27245,Penny,"hey, sorry about that."
27554,Penny,say the quote again.
25756,Penny,"oh, well, you know, leonard is great."
23490,Penny,"oh, my god. that’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me that i didn’t understand."
24745,Penny,listening to dr. cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again
22565,Penny,pasadena city college? 
24096,Penny,"okay. well, i am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. might give you more confidence."
27427,Penny,"well, if i would have been there and saw you alone, i would’ve asked you to dance."
23432,Penny,"look, leonard, what goes on between me and stuart is none of your business. so just leave it alone, okay?"
22663,Penny,"oh my god, i need help.  "
25015,Penny,okay.
25720,Penny,good move telling sheldon.
27852,Penny,"oh, yes. hi, mary."
26028,Penny,"we know what’s going on, sheldon!"
27491,Penny,"so, if you don’t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?"
28992,Penny,"hey, hey, i just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree."
21932,Penny,"no, i haven’t."
25009,Penny,my mirth. classic.
29307,Penny,"oh, we would love that."
26551,Penny,"pants, but leonard says sex doesn’t count."
22272,Penny,"alright you guys, good luck."
27312,Penny,"well, we’re in vegas. i want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until i vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere."
26012,Penny,no!
28205,Penny,uh.
25681,Penny,"well, a little. you hear stuff."
24242,Penny,good.
23626,Penny,"leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. i just, you know, i didn’t want you to be bored."
28783,Penny,so it’s okay for you to joke around?
27037,Penny,"uh, since you’re paying for dinner, i’ll let that slide. open yours."
22950,Penny,because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
27821,Penny,you think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there?
28730,Penny,"you know, i had no idea caltech is exactly like my high school."
26110,Penny,oh.

28762,Penny,"wow, where did you learn these moves?"
25484,Penny,this is amazing. how did you even get this idea?

22483,Penny,"i’m going over to mike’s. leonard, thank you so much."
29504,Penny,hi.
22332,Penny,nothing. diet coke. and yoghurt. a little nail polish.

27298,Penny,"oh, that’s so sweet. i mean, look at you, you are gorgeous."
24997,Penny,what? i don’t know. it doesn’t matter.
25021,Penny,what’s the difference?
23245,Penny,"well, what’s wrong with my apartment?"
26435,Penny,well…
29387,Penny,hi guys.
27014,Penny,i don’t know. what do you want to do?
28934,Penny,what a jerk.
26024,Penny,you’re talking about leonard.
25403,Penny,how about this?
23450,Penny,sheldon says you’re going to the north pole.
22383,Penny,"really, they have your little name label in them. "
23771,Penny,"wait, wait. let’s sing it as a round. i’ll start. soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… see that’s where you come in. i’ll start over. soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… i’ve got all night, sheldon. soft kitty, warm kitty…  little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
27673,Penny,"so, why did you finally tell me?"
22687,Penny,i am not your squeeze. there is no squeezing.
27735,Penny,this food is amazing.
23283,Penny,"sheldon, i’m sure it’s going to be fine."
29107,Penny,"wait, leonard, he’s hurting. let him feel how he feels."
25434,Penny,"well, that was fun."
25923,Penny,nope. i have no reason to… “b” mad at you. minus.
22779,Penny,i don’t care. i’m taking a stand. metaphorically.
25290,Penny,oh. penny. nice to meet you.
27237,Penny,just don’t take it.
24130,Penny,"okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. i didn’t know what to say."
24999,Penny,"what, are they getting engaged?"
25477,Penny,yep.
28091,Penny,what else can you do? move back in with him?
24838,Penny,"oh, okay. well, i guess it’s just the two of us, huh?"
22630,Penny,"alright, alright, how do i get the sword?"
23059,Penny,"well, which is it, ten or eleven?"
29323,Penny,"all right, well, that doesn’t prove anything."
26185,Penny,"yeah, let’s try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. you know, when you’re all hunched like that, you’re shutting the audience out, but when you’re relaxed and open, you’re inviting them in."
23013,Penny,"sheldon, honey, aren’t you getting a little carried away? i mean, it’s just a toy robot."
26055,Penny,where are we going?
25155,Penny,oh! look at you guys just hitting it off. i am so good.
22629,Penny,"no, no, i’ve a bronze dagger."
23980,Penny,"okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but i’m over it."
25920,Penny,"right, because me being in school is so important to you. that way, you wouldn’t have to be dating someone who’s only a waitress."
28390,Penny,"okay, it’s not like she’s got the christ child in there, all right?  oh. it’s leonard. he says sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them."
23029,Penny,"sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, i don’t know, pleasant?"
29409,Penny,hey.
25289,Penny,oh.
22250,Penny,you’ll never guess what just happened.
27049,Penny,"wow, you really struck a nerve. i’ve never heard him use the m word before."
26500,Penny,"oh, good. check it out, the disappointing child by beverly hofstadter."
25456,Penny,that’s because you overthink everything.
26106,Penny,then what’s the problem?
24391,Penny,"no, no, no, no. you’re right. we’re not going out anymore, i should pay for myself.  what?"
23074,Penny,"yeah, well, that’s not really my big problem."
23946,Penny,and you’re stuck?
23448,Penny,excuse me.
27024,Penny,i haven’t been complaining that much about the movie. have i?
25510,Penny,"you know, i’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him. that’s how i told my high school boyfriend i slept with his brother. that’s how i told his brother the same thing."
26101,Penny,"that is what i write on the bathroom walls. for a whimsically inventive time, call leonard hofstadter."
25099,Penny,"shh! it’s my agent, it’s my agent. you’re kidding. oh, my gosh. i can’t believe it! really? oh, i’m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. okay, bye. i got the haemorrhoid commercial! i start monday."
26246,Penny,"so, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?"
22867,Penny,"oh, okay, all right, you know what? i’ll tell you what happened. we were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house."
28545,Penny,"okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident."
22847,Penny,please don’t do that.
24201,Penny,"oh, um, i, i can come back."
26488,Penny,"you know, i’m surprised you want to copy my answers since i’m not even smart enough to be on your team. "
25506,Penny,leonard’s day?
22902,Penny,"you’re kidding, right?"
23378,Penny,"yum. well, enjoy your big evening."
28903,Penny,"you know what, i’ve met bert. isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?"
23945,Penny,yes.
22921,Penny,"okay, well, thank you for that, but i got you and leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so i’ll just put them under my tree."
27467,Penny,"okay, look, i know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh."
24060,Penny,deal.
25582,Penny,almost done.
26987,Penny,no.
27242,Penny,"that we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me."
28436,Penny,say hi to emily for us.
22733,Penny,"you know, like what’s his deal? is it girls? guys? sock puppets?"
23023,Penny,hello sheldon.
22089,Penny,"no, come on, it’s going to be fun, and you all look great, i mean, look at you, thor, and, oh, peter pan, that’s so cute."
24036,Penny,"why, you did, sir. you. dr. sheldon cooper, and may i add, it is a privilege to know you."
28143,Penny,"hi. look at that. i’m in a movie, my shirt stayed on."
24135,Penny,what?
21867,Penny,"oh, that’s nice."
27976,Penny,"oh, okay. so you’re saying this is my fault?"
29490,Penny,what is wrong with you?
24690,Penny,"wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?"
26555,Penny,"i get that, but why is this so hard?"
25316,Penny,yeah.
24285,Penny,"uh, leonard, this is zack. zack, leonard."
28190,Penny,fine.
24126,Penny,bite me!
27234,Penny,"oh, what did those rascals do now?"
24051,Penny,"well, i’m kind of responsible for sheldon missing stan lee, and i really want to make it up to him. so i was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe i can arrange for them to meet."
23388,Penny,"yeah, why not?"
23479,Penny,"no, you’re right, you shouldn’t talk to him. i will."
27933,Penny,"ha-ha, don’t push it."
27746,Penny,you still worried some berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?
21899,Penny,"i just, i can’t believe i trusted him."
22594,Penny,"sheldon, come back, you’re losing me."
26321,Penny,"so, then, during my afternoon shift, i spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself."
24490,Penny,complimentary nachos! you enjoy. never had sex? wow.
27737,Penny,shut up.
22586,Penny,"had a great time, ciao "
28709,Penny,you threatened to sue?
22508,Penny,"okay. um, here’s the thing. so, i’ve known for a while now that leonard has had a little crush on me…"
25728,Penny,did i miss it?
28566,Penny,we did.
25726,Penny,"oh, grow up."
25370,Penny,"wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on."
25884,Penny,yeah. you got a problem with that?
25089,Penny,yeah.
25679,Penny,not.
26030,Penny,"oh, you seem extra happy."
25321,Penny,"hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and i turned out just fine. hey, look, i have peach schnapps. thank god."
24868,Penny,"yeah, well, it’s not gonna happen tonight. you know, for the first time in my life, i am not in a relationship, and i’m totally okay with it."
26168,Penny,what?
29281,Penny,"okay, are you sure about this?"
25157,Penny,is raj out with emily again?
25791,Penny,"ugh. hey, sheldon? hi. this came for you today. it’s from your mom."
28790,Penny,agreed. thank you.
24448,Penny,what?
22835,Penny,"well, yeah, we did have a date."
24692,Penny,"i, i wasn’t going to."
26775,Penny,you okay?
26331,Penny,okay. good.
24437,Penny,"hey, look, it’s shamy."
23360,Penny,it’s really good.
22961,Penny,"yeah, he came into the restaurant. sorry the napkin’s dirty. he wiped his mouth with it."
28280,Penny,"uh, denial. see, sweetie, the list goes on and on."
23048,Penny,"okay. well, thank you. oh, god, no, i can’t. sheldon honey, i don’t want things to be weird between us."
25451,Penny,mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?
21941,Penny,i’m just going to go wash up.
28013,Penny,"okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. but i get it."
22287,Penny,"ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend."
24729,Penny,we are not having coitus.
28855,Penny,"yeah, i wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready."
29106,Penny,"and if you really want to hurt him, i look great in chanel."
23957,Penny,toad of truth? is that a physics thing?
25909,Penny,"no, leonard, this is my thing."
26183,Penny,"uh, i’m sorry, can we just pause for a minute?"
27333,Penny,this is for you.
25928,Penny,"now, ladies, we got a b-minus on this paper. i think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an a."
27789,Penny,"yeah, i kind of want to do it again."
26534,Penny,yeah.
23284,Penny,"okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?"
28312,Penny,"okay, fine, i accept your apology, now get out."
24061,Penny,yup.
28127,Penny,"okay, okay, okay. thumbs down. next."
24851,Penny,"look, sheldon, leonard is dating priya. she is staying with raj. that means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out there more."
22681,Penny,"uh, come on, good night leonard."
29161,Penny,"yeah, it’s yours."
22349,Penny,"oh, no, no, i want to. it sounds really interesting. "
24120,Penny,hi.
25822,Penny,wow. anything else?
24513,Penny,"you know, i could totally rock a hat like that."
23526,Penny,"no, no. you may be right about me and leonard."
23975,Penny,"okay, what’s the big surprise?"
27881,Penny,"yeah, you’ve been going out for years. you haven’t even slept together."
27368,Penny,"okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money."
25542,Penny,i have no idea. that is weird.
28244,Penny,maybe he just had bread in his pocket.
25518,Penny,"hey, what are you guys doing here?"
22582,Penny,"okay, well i have a date too, so see ya."
27736,Penny,"oh, so it’s like the view."
27601,Penny,you okay?
24138,Penny,did leonard send you over here?
26586,Penny,mmm.
26387,Penny,"wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time."
27630,Penny,open the door now.
22028,Penny,"okay, i’m not talking about this with you."
23723,Penny,uh-huh.
24880,Penny,"oh, unbelievable! know how he did it yet?"
29263,Penny,"well, maybe, i mean, it seems kind of perfect. i have sales experience, and i’ve been a waitress, so i have restaurant experience, and if he’s figuring out my christmas bonus, we could buy a boat."
27022,Penny,why would they lie to us?
25637,Penny,"ooh, am i about to get a rare sheldon cooper hug?"
27611,Penny,"i don’t know, just think about something else."
27756,Penny,"i care. oh, wait, no, i don’t. good luck, raj."
29060,Penny,what? are you really upset about randall coming?
27282,Penny,almost everyone has a past.
22374,Penny,"oh, leonard. "
21865,Penny,"oh, hi!"
22157,Penny,"look, howard, i know her, okay, she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things. "
26671,Penny,how you doing over there?
24931,Penny,hi. we’re just heading out for a drink.
22720,Penny,"sheldon, it’s c, just put down c."
26920,Penny,are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
29048,Penny,"no. no, you don’t, you really don’t. i actually can’t say don’t enough."
22444,Penny,of course.
29401,Penny,"hey, guys, what’d i miss? what’d i miss?"
23290,Penny,i can see.
22494,Penny,"no, i know, i got that. yeah, totally."
24029,Penny,"yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day."
23482,Penny,oh. sorry. i don’t know your sad song.
26638,Penny,so how do i undo this?
29075,Penny,"so, did you wind up sending that machine back?"
26511,Penny,"sweetie, i’m so sorry. i wish there was something i could do to make you feel better."
28203,Penny,it’s not working.
29072,Penny,"hopefully, he won’t be too upset."
23982,Penny,"oh, my god, leonard! that’s incredible!"
21940,Penny,"yes, i know, men can’t fly."
26837,Penny,should we take this little party to the bedroom?
24833,Penny,okay.
25599,Penny,yesterday. you made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
23055,Penny,"okay, whatever. it’s not like i’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. i bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?"
25068,Penny,"yeah, sure. yay!"
27570,Penny,"oh, god. probably nothing. i think i saw the director twirling a sign outside the verizon store."
26499,Penny,hi. i thought you went to the comic book store on wednesdays.
27422,Penny,"sheldon, doesn’t amy look hot? that’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin."
26674,Penny,"wow, so, how long will you be gone?"
26204,Penny,i can laugh about it now.
29242,Penny,all that and he’s shorter than me.
23142,Penny,"look, i was just coming over to talk to you."
25821,Penny,oh! you’re kidding.
28277,Penny,"um, a psychiatrist. why?"
27129,Penny,where did you get a ring?
26999,Penny,"i gave him a new look. it’s cute, huh?"
25432,Penny,bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
26206,Penny,"oh, yeah, right. wait, what was your problem again?"
22984,Penny,"yeah, come on in. what’s up?"
28318,Penny,here’s some champagne.
25158,Penny,"wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend."
27320,Penny,that’s a dollar.
26066,Penny,"mmmm. now i feel bad for picking on all those kids. although, in my defence, if danny biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie."
27457,Penny,"hey, why did you get two? i’m with stupid."
26903,Penny,not great. can i talk to you for a sec?
24326,Penny,how long has this been going on?
22587,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
23295,Penny,okay.
23472,Penny,"oh, this is ridiculous. what?"
28464,Penny,mm-hmm.
25490,Penny,"no, you’ve got a reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe."
23296,Penny,"see ya. i’m dressed like a slob today, too."
26142,Penny,"no. i said, oh, my god, i think that old guy’s choking, and then one of the busboys heimlich’ed him."
23506,Penny,what did you tell them?
22004,Penny,i’m sorry?
25276,Penny,"no, you don’t."
27133,Penny,you want some wine?
29302,Penny,"well, what’s wrong with that?"
27768,Penny,"hey, kevin. it’s really exciting to talk to you."
28461,Penny,why?
23356,Penny,excuse me.
26298,Penny,i’m sorry to hear about your troubles.
27681,Penny,"aw, sweetie, i’m comfortable around you, too."
25231,Penny,"okay, that time you looked at me."
28496,Penny,"not the drinking game, a drinking game."
22857,Penny,i could think about you.
28329,Penny,yeah.
25246,Penny,"oh, come on, amy."
29442,Penny,would you say that’s about 40 milliliters?
27787,Penny,"okay, look, would it make you feel better if i did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a kevin smith movie?"
27492,Penny,"no, but if things don’t work out with me and leonard, i’ll give you a call. wait. how much do you talk about star trek?"
26029,Penny,what? he’s loving it?
24169,Penny,"leonard, stop pressuring me."
27161,Penny,"seriously, let him go."
24108,Penny,"fine, faint."
23777,Penny,she agreed to go out with you for free. what more do you need?
25227,Penny,"leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it."
25921,Penny,"do i? listen to me. i need to do this on my own. if i fail, i fail. if i pass, i pass. do you get it?"
24765,Penny,this is all about listening and responding.
28482,Penny,hey. amy’s downstairs.
28605,Penny,"thank you. so if we would have asked you to come to vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?"
25576,Penny,why did you get bongos?
29143,Penny,"just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me."
28346,Penny,do people like money? is that what you’re asking?
29049,Penny,"wow, i find that hard to believe."
23159,Penny,"okay, okay, how about this? we tell him somebody broke in."
27476,Penny,what?
27562,Penny,mmmm.
29215,Penny,"you know, there was a time i would say what’s a soup sack? but i’m glad we’re past that.  you know, there was a time i would say god bless you, and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about thor? and i would say, how do you know i didn’t mean thor? and then you would say touché, and that there ends the tale of why i no longer say"
27537,Penny,is that why you had to take him to office depot last night?
29369,Penny,"oh, hey guys, what’s up?"
27244,Penny,"well, that’s not good. you being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on."
24186,Penny,yep.
22858,Penny,"always nice talking to you, sheldon."
24465,Penny,"yeah, sure. just yesterday, she asked, why is howard hiding under the table?"
27370,Penny,"okay, if it’s sometimes howie wears yours, leonard already told us."
25632,Penny,"hi, you guys got a minute?"
27550,Penny,what’s up?
23717,Penny,get in here! hurry! don’t you dare knock.
24289,Penny,"hey, guys, this is my friend zack."
26368,Penny,that’s great. do you want some wine?
27742,Penny,i don’t think i’ve eaten that much in my entire life.
23539,Penny,a homunculus?
26861,Penny,"how about instead of assuming i failed, you ask me how it went?"
26458,Penny,"me, too."
23863,Penny,"okay, you know what? it’s lame when i say it, it’s just ridiculous when you pile on."
22440,Penny,sure.
26170,Penny,"yeah, i know. i’m a total bitch."
28758,Penny,"so, what do you want to do?"
26203,Penny,it’s more like how girls end up at a best western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named luther.
24635,Penny,you make a cute green arrow.
23367,Penny,oh come on. i think it’s nice that captain sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
23354,Penny,"no, no, no, i just meant for… yeah."
22379,Penny,oh. wow. good for you. 
29044,Penny,although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance. 
25619,Penny,"all right, then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene."
28486,Penny,"nice hat, sheldon."
23271,Penny,what?
23704,Penny,"all right, what’s going on?"
22185,Penny,"um, raj, honey, you say you can’t talk to women but… you’ve been talking to me."
24438,Penny,all righty. what’s new?
28838,Penny,okay.
24610,Penny,no.
22087,Penny,the parade?
26950,Penny,"what is this, my first day?"
27218,Penny,for what?
23899,Penny,that you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you’d get to second base?
23641,Penny,"you know, leonard, honey, i wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with sheldon."
22348,Penny,"so, how do you feel? nice and loose? come to play? got your game face on?  are you ready?"
22567,Penny,"right, but i have to have some sort of degree to date you? "
25251,Penny,"we are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you."
29054,Penny,"i, i’m not sure. maybe a few days. unless he gets the job, then who knows?"
28768,Penny,was it a good one?
28466,Penny,"sweetie, i know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?"
24726,Penny,"oh, okay. just like old times."
23488,Penny,"oh, leonard, you shouldn’t have. oh, boy! what is it?"
28721,Penny,"oh, it’s funny, i was just thinking the same thing about you."
27533,Penny,i know. i’m really proud of sheldon.
28894,Penny,bam. thank you. what’s her name?
28360,Penny,"i was just hungry and cranky, and i’ve never been called ma’am before."
26131,Penny,"well, you know how he is. he’s sensitive and emotional."
25219,Penny,"i’m sorry, go ahead."
26639,Penny,"great, well, what do i have to do?"
28274,Penny,"oh, not good. still couldn’t get in to see dr. gallo."
27069,Penny,yeah.
24007,Penny,here’s your soup.
24357,Penny,"okay. well, then, there’s a couple of things you should probably know."
25130,Penny,"i can’t even believe this. you know, maybe you should just go."
22979,Penny,"yeah, you might be right. but back to you. i know you think you’re some sort of smooth-talking ladies’ man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy."
24643,Penny,"whatever your secret is, i’m sure it’s boring, so i’m not interested."
28889,Penny,"oh, that means so much. i love you."
28175,Penny,"well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone."
27059,Penny,"oh, like attack of the clones. we are leaving right now."
27994,Penny,"actually, i think he’s onto something."
29239,Penny,oh.
23149,Penny,then what difference does it make?
27446,Penny,"oh, it’s nice you got him that."
29455,Penny,"i don’t think so, mom. not today."
27889,Penny,"you know, i can see why amy’s mad at you."
23032,Penny,eww.
24749,Penny,you want an acting lesson?
27307,Penny,"so, where should we go first?"
24731,Penny,"leonard, are you asleep?"
22511,Penny,"no. what i’m saying is, leonard might be different in a good way. obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well. "
24741,Penny,"hey, leonard, is your wi-fi down? i can’t get on."
24474,Penny,"well, what was your side?"
25022,Penny,thanks for clearing that up.
23169,Penny,no. not at all.
22566,Penny,"wow, i get it, because dr leonard hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree. "
29453,Penny,"hey, sheldon, did you change your wi-fi password again?"
21934,Penny,"hey raj!  still not talking to me, huh?"
22827,Penny,"yeah, when we first met, you said that if i went out with you, i could drive a car on mars."
28712,Penny,good morning.
26353,Penny,did you bring enough inhalers?
26913,Penny,i don’t know what to say.
22970,Penny,leonard?
27138,Penny,"okay, then, yeah."
22834,Penny,"well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating."
27769,Penny,"oh, wow. i wish it was better."
27404,Penny,the word is popular.
26117,Penny,"well, um, i’m just a little thirsty."
27997,Penny,"all right, look, i’m sorry i said i was okay with everything before we got married. i hate that we’re going through this, but i don’t know what to do."
26163,Penny,"yes, absolutely. now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. i totally taught him that."
22184,Penny,"okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. why don’t you just meet this girl and, see what happens."
28596,Penny,"you know, being in a relationship with leonard also comes with its challenges."
27796,Penny,"okay. sheldon, let me ask you a question."
26242,Penny,so tenured means a job for life?
23355,Penny,what about the guy over there in the superhero t-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
24600,Penny,i’m suggesting there might be something you could do about amy’s urges?
27260,Penny,"yeah, i hope you’re right."
28451,Penny,like this?
24752,Penny,"okay, just to be clear. you are asking me for help because i know something that the brilliant dr. sheldon cooper doesn’t."

26721,Penny,"hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on tv tomorrow night."
27365,Penny,maybe it’s a good thing we came here. it’s like a lesson in what not to do.
28431,Penny,"see, she’s trying to get you back. now, that is exactly what i would’ve gotten you if i had any idea what it is or what you do."
23324,Penny,"oh, actually, that’s okay. we already have…"

28692,Penny,"okay, all right, honey, you know what? there was something i was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now i’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t barbara chen, it was me. i’m the reason everyone knows."

22956,Penny,"okay, merry christmas."
24867,Penny,"i don’t know. it’s fun while you’re doing it. and then after, it’s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret."
24425,Penny,"oh, great. hi, i’m penny, i’ll be your waitress."
28192,Penny,he really seems into her.
25648,Penny,"leonard, i bought you this because i wanted you to have fun with it. i don’t want it to just sit in this box."
27112,Penny,"oh, my god. what a day."
29315,Penny,"all right, then we agree. he’s not making any moves, it’s this dr. ramona chick."
23690,Penny,"okay, if leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn’t he just said so?"
22051,Penny,"oh, come on, you went to college."
29165,Penny,"raj, you don’t have to serve us."
22346,Penny,what did he say?

27615,Penny,now imagine you’re holding that pen.
25438,Penny,"okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and i panicked."
24670,Penny,"oh, yes. he says they are lost without you."

29096,Penny,"oh, that’s gonna make me cry."
24458,Penny,what’s up?
27230,Penny,so what? why do you even care?
22377,Penny,"no you didn’t. look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are. "
28506,Penny,i can’t believe this. you realize i make more money than you?
24937,Penny,how come?
22039,Penny,"well, it’s all good. "
29210,Penny,"hey, leonard, if you’re not busy tomorrow, i have to do a little reception after work."

26192,Penny,"aw, sweetie, you just made my day."
23463,Penny,that wasn’t a long hug.
22142,Penny,why? 
26000,Penny,"now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. you’re going to have to know how to gut it. so, what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly.  you want me to stop?"
23643,Penny,and you’re gonna be here for a couple more.
29463,Penny,"oh, sorry."
24493,Penny,what are you doing here?
23598,Penny,"well, in the first grade, my friend rosie and i made a pact to marry bert and ernie. you know, from sesame street?"
25594,Penny,"sorry, stallion. your weird friend giraffe is here."

27858,Penny,mm-hmm.
26078,Penny,i don’t know how leonard can get so caught up in this.
23146,Penny,how can i calm down? i’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. that’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
27367,Penny,hang on. i want to see if he gets the star.
27598,Penny,you want me to stop reading?
28809,Penny,"honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now?"
23318,Penny,yes.
22398,Penny,"yeah, that’s terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.  happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you…"
26407,Penny,okay.
25829,Penny,how about boys versus girls?
24909,Penny,"no, she doesn’t."
28141,Penny,"aw. when he says things like that, i just want to hug him and make everything better."

25631,Penny,he’s bringing me. who are you bringing?
26739,Penny,how could you say that?
22207,Penny,"no, this is stuff i want you to throw out. "
29373,Penny,"okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, i slipped and skinned my knee."
24896,Penny,"uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?"

25126,Penny,"no, it’s completely fine. hmm. i get it. sheldon sent you. he put you up to this."
23604,Penny,the problem isn’t what’s on the inside. it’s the creepy candy coating.
23656,Penny,"okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out."
26091,Penny,"hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about thor?"

28158,Penny,i can’t believe sheldon was gonna ask amy to marry him.
26648,Penny,yeah.

22807,Penny,"yes, i left them in the washers and when i went down to get them, they were gone."
22481,Penny,"no, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels. "
26146,Penny,"no, i’m into it, i’m into it. just, there’s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out."
26952,Penny,i’m gonna go with monster. what do you got?

27003,Penny,"sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? i mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? maybe something new to study will find you."
29085,Penny,"sorry, guys. this club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? i thought we got rid of all those."
24294,Penny,"damn you, you rat bastard."

26528,Penny,"sheldon, i don’t understand. i thought you said you were fine with it."
25954,Penny,"oh, good, i guessed right."

28653,Penny,why?
26905,Penny,i did. i called them. the part’s gone. they gave it to someone else. now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
25929,Penny,believable? you saying i’m not smart?
28449,Penny,"wow, really? called my bluff. all righty then."
28897,Penny,"now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of legos?"
28868,Penny,ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
29230,Penny,yes. please find someone who cares.
22497,Penny,"yeah. why not, i mean, what do i have to lose?"

23301,Penny,"okay, now i see the giant squid head. "
28105,Penny,"all right, well, heather h says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once. kelly m says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before i could say no. jessica k says, i told the weird owner that i liked his shirt. he took it off and gave it to me."
26812,Penny,i can’t believe leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets. 
24743,Penny,oh. how’d he do?
22672,Penny,"and you guys aren’t going? i can’t believe you, raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him?"
23045,Penny,but what if you need it?
26968,Penny,wow.
26145,Penny,"oh, right. yeah, we can do something."

25784,Penny,uh-huh.
29432,Penny,"darn tootin’, i do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed nebraskan turn of phrase."
29207,Penny,"yeah, you’re right. you know, you’re really sensitive about this kind of stuff."

21877,Penny,"oh, that’s so nice, i’d love to."
23814,Penny,"yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. a lot of the girls threw up, but i gutted that thing like a deer."
25156,Penny,"mustache is looking good there, sheldon."

22340,Penny,that is correct.
27645,Penny,what? you’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
26818,Penny,"well, there’s a bar in the lobby."
25192,Penny,"well, that, that’s good. i’m glad you came to that. but before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question."

24791,Penny,"we have been monitoring your son sheldon from the 23rd century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. his unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy."
27778,Penny,"okay, instead of protecting me, why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?"
23064,Penny,"yes, dinner’s here, and i’m having some. i’m having takeout food."
26481,Penny,"well, wait. don’t you want to know how i figured it out?"
26827,Penny,"oh, come on, it wasn’t me. anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened."
28115,Penny,"all right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?"
22279,Penny,i’m… i’m sorry.
25580,Penny,"all right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? i’ve taken you to disneyland, i kicked a bully in the nuts for you, i sing you soft kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once."

26369,Penny,what’s the matter?
25663,Penny,"come on, you do it to feel superior. i see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet."

22677,Penny,"um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you?"
22270,Penny,"hah, yeah! because he didn’t want sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in america has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner."
27466,Penny,"oh, i don’t know. maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss."
27982,Penny,some girl named mandy.

22510,Penny,"yeah, i don’t care, i don’t care. the point is leonard isn’t the kind of guy i usually go out with."
25901,Penny,spaghetti okay?
28688,Penny,"in, like, two minutes. yeah. so, how is everything going around here? are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant?"

28842,Penny,"well, go ahead. he’s right over there."
23359,Penny,"well, if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt, i don’t know what will. is this me?"
27786,Penny,"leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? so our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. this is the way life is. and i’m sure in time they’ll change again."
24926,Penny,"you guys should’ve seen leonard when i first met him. there was no eye contact. he was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes."
28813,Penny,we’re doing good. i think sheldon has something he would like to say to amy.
23525,Penny,"okay, forget the chicken."
22405,Penny,"shuddup, yeah you do. "
24830,Penny,why?
23664,Penny,hey.
23440,Penny, sheldon.
23660,Penny,"hey, if i want to invite the entire line up of lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, i will, and it’s none of your business!"
25036,Penny,"hey, you guys ready to order?"
22518,Penny,sheldon! 
27184,Penny,people.

23884,Penny,i’m sleeping with your son.
25429,Penny,"see, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk."
29466,Penny,who do we love?
28921,Penny,"uh, we ran out of candy on halloween, i was just giving everything away."
25596,Penny,not a chance.
27552,Penny,"sheldon, we are just people. we talk about the same things you guys talk about."
27504,Penny,"sweetie, you really thought i’d want to do this?"
24686,Penny,"oh. oh, okay, well, you know, like i said, i have plans, so."
27698,Penny,yes.
28276,Penny,"well, the doctor’s a woman, but yes, because you never know."
24510,Penny,how long?
22406,Penny,"uh, that’s so silly."
27360,Penny,i see it.
24364,Penny,"no, no, i was just giving you a compliment."
22236,Penny,"okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, i know leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there’s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing."
27518,Penny,is there any part of your body that’s normal?
26095,Penny,i hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.
25924,Penny,"that’s right. on my paper. not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf."
27565,Penny,"and you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. so, how’s the detector going?"
24805,Penny,"you’re really a broken toy, aren’t you?"
22987,Penny,his feelings needed to be hurt.
22818,Penny,"oh, my god."
24235,Penny,female jibber jabber?
23914,Penny,i would not.
24032,Penny,"all right, let’s go."
24665,Penny,"hi. i’m sorry to bother you guys, but you’ve got to come take your sheldon back."
24238,Penny,"no, mr. smarty-pants. i ignored the fill gas tank light."
26138,Penny,"come on, amy, let’s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are."
24771,Penny,"um, okay, sure. luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here."
25803,Penny,maybe i could do it.
23070,Penny,hey.
24619,Penny,no. i’m not wearing it. it looks stupid.
25031,Penny,it makes him desperate to please women. that’s why the foreplay goes on and on.
23916,Penny,you saying i don’t have an open mind?
28706,Penny,"yeah, come on in."
22622,Penny,"leonard, guess what, i’m a level three warrior."
25381,Penny,"oh, my god, now i know what i sound like to you when i say stupid stuff."
25907,Penny,it’s really good. we’ve been talking about the origins of slavery. turn in my first paper tomorrow.
28835,Penny,okay.
24226,Penny,"no, be friends. you and me."
24779,Penny,and you think it’s better than tennessee williams?
23464,Penny,"leonard, i don’t know what to tell you. it was just a hug."
27050,Penny,"what? that’s a real thing? what is it, star wars christmas?"
29336,Penny,"okay. um, let’s try this. think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect."
27818,Penny,"oh, i pack light. once, i got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long t-shirt and a belt."
25798,Penny,why do you need all this stuff?
24179,Penny,right.
22563,Penny,what are you talking about.
28526,Penny,"because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal."
27451,Penny,"sheldon, it was just a little tremor."
25351,Penny,"no, we weren’t really like that. i mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. like, okay, this one girl, kathy geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight."
28474,Penny,what am i smelling?
23451,Penny,yeah. i’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.
26343,Penny,"look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? but just because good things are happening to leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. you know what? let me tell you a little story. once there was a girl who worked at the cheesecake factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job."
22057,Penny,"so, do you know who’s in there?"
23780,Penny,"howard, you’re going to throw away a great girl like bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?"
22610,Penny,"i know what it means, sheldon! god, you know, i have been in l.a. for almost two years now, and i haven’t got a single acting job, i have accomplished nothing, haven’t gotten a raise at work, haven’t even had sex in six months, and just now when i was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and i ate it."
22557,Penny,"you know, i’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about i let you know."
27315,Penny,"it means instead of having a week to study, i only have two days."
29128,Penny,"oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?"
25802,Penny,you really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here?
29468,Penny,"yeah, i heard you. i got red."
28993,Penny,"no, what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe, you don’t let go."
24307,Penny,"yeah, it must have been. i just threw up in my closet."
26948,Penny,i killed it. i was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.
29001,Penny,ugh. leonard?
27738,Penny,"wait, who’s tor?"
26711,Penny,aw.
24576,Penny,"i’m sorry, daddy…"
23514,Penny,hit me.
24542,Penny,"oh, hey, amy. look, i’m sorry i got so upset. i just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! what are you doing?"
25382,Penny,"okay, i don’t think amy wants a pocket watch."
21952,Penny,"hey raj.  hey, listen, i don’t know if you heard about what happened last night with leonard and sheldon, but i’m really upset about it, i mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, i mean can you even believe that? how weird is that?"
28029,Penny,"oh, yeah, right. lock up your daughters or sheldon might lecture them about the north american free trade agreement."
25553,Penny,grab your hammer.
22005,Penny,four dozen?
26049,Penny,"keep talking about captain kirk, and we’re all gonna stop."
26986,Penny,"okay. i get it. i mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but i know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it."
28818,Penny,"well, it could be for the monkey movie. it could be my haemorrhoid commercial. the list does not go on."
23621,Penny,it was pretty good. we won.
26737,Penny,so you think i’ll be on tv and in movies and win awards.
28394,Penny,that was such a fun night.
26190,Penny,"okay. so, what do you need?"
22274,Penny,"well, based on what you told me, i’m not surprised. "
29491,Penny,"you know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game."
22703,Penny,too bad.
28787,Penny,"leonard breathes on me, too. it’s not a big deal."
22804,Penny,"another night? well, i guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you’ll know that laundry night is always saturday night."
25649,Penny,yes.
26979,Penny,no. did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls?
28045,Penny,"they started to, then her water broke. you know, if he finds out we eloped, it’s gonna break his heart."
27875,Penny,"wait, what is wrong with you two? he was talking about television during their date night."
24343,Penny,"oh, that’s great. have fun."
23413,Penny,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, um…"
26255,Penny,no.
28859,Penny,wet wall?
23941,Penny,"sheldon, i can’t believe i’m saying this, but i’m going to miss you."
26084,Penny,"wait, i thought we were reading."
26339,Penny,"yeah, it does, and here we are."
28700,Penny,"well, if it makes you feel any better, bernadette’s mad at me, too."
26959,Penny,"okay, it’s not me, right? this script is terrible."
23113,Penny,"yeah, leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist."
27122,Penny,"okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? i finally realize i don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy."
22618,Penny,what’s afk?
25927,Penny,"so, i know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, i will beat you both with a bag of oranges."
26501,Penny,yeah. it’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
24613,Penny,i’m still mad at you.
23117,Penny,"oh, well, i had a wonderful childhood."
26277,Penny,"ugh, that sounds like a lot of work."
28406,Penny,"all right, what about music?"
24300,Penny,we’re gonna have sex.
24277,Penny,"so, why was it his lucky day?"
27717,Penny,what? are you kidding? we’re not hanging it.
22718,Penny,doing what?
24170,Penny,"yeah, you are! just back off!"
26768,Penny,"listen, i don’t want to break up with you."
29471,Penny,"well, it’s a little late for me to start saying no, isn’t it?"
28808,Penny,"down the road? sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you’re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women."
26229,Penny,"come on. look, the letter was found in bernadette’s closet. doesn’t that count for something?"
26419,Penny,i won’t.
25008,Penny,"i don’t know, maybe, i have no idea what you said."
23854,Penny,so i take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree.
28732,Penny,"well, so are you. in fact, you know what? we will never take you for granite. did you get that? granite? a little geology joke."
24089,Penny,i just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
29117,Penny,hi.
27587,Penny,"amelia and the time-trav… found it. it was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, amelia prepared to do her chores. except something about this morning felt different."
23516,Penny,"because i like peppermint, and it’s fun to say schnapps. hey, leonard?"
29454,Penny,damn.
25483,Penny,"yeah. oh. here’s my list for you, right there."
28022,Penny,oh.
22753,Penny,"um, sure, sisters.  holy crap on a cracker."

29056,Penny,"okay. thank you, you’re the best. mm."
22399,Penny,"so leonard, will we be seeing you on saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?"
25764,Penny,"amy, you?"
23714,Penny,come in! hurry!
23766,Penny,thanks. that’s much better.
23718,Penny,"i slipped in the shower, and i think i dislocated my shoulder."
25442,Penny,"well, we don’t really have to pretend."
26802,Penny,"well, it’s scary for me, too."
26023,Penny,what is happening?
24398,Penny,"sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
25285,Penny,to get sex.
22458,Penny,"well, for one thing, we’re late for leonard’s birthday party. and for another, i told him to call security. "

26315,Penny,"fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. sixteen! yes! oh, please tell me we’re playing for money."

27579,Penny,how could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?
26098,Penny,"well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?"
26276,Penny,you think?
29077,Penny,i can’t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
23787,Penny,"come on, howard. you hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. plus, i’ve kind of been talkin’ some smack about ya."
25731,Penny,that’s hot. you kids better use protection.
24824,Penny,"if i had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, i wouldn’t have to take that."
28997,Penny,leonard?
22735,Penny,i’m sorry?
23844,Penny,"okay, i just have one question. what exactly are sub-atomic particles?"

24565,Penny,"love you, too."
25143,Penny,"come in, let’s talk. do you want a glass of wine?"

22808,Penny,"sheldon, where are my clothes?"
28200,Penny,look at us. our first thanksgiving as husband and wife.
26974,Penny,"well, i’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and i got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and i just don’t know if i should take it."
25416,Penny,wow. can they?
25993,Penny,"step one, worms."
22389,Penny,you’re welcome. 
27342,Penny,"and i really appreciate it, but now i don’t need it, so here you go."
28840,Penny,"yep, there they are."

25426,Penny,it’s the same thing.
29395,Penny,"here you go, raj, you might want to drink this one slowly."
27327,Penny,yeah. it’s all very professional.
26668,Penny,"you know, if it makes you feel any better…"
29064,Penny,"if you were this upset, why didn’t you say so when i told you?"
27584,Penny,"oh, my god, it’s about her and sheldon."
27908,Penny,"wow, there’s a denny’s in vegas you can actually get married in."
24651,Penny,"oh, honey, i’m sorry."

22583,Penny,"no, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. oh, hey leonard."
23876,Penny,yikes. what’s so funny?
26994,Penny,or i don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.
26893,Penny,because it was crap. it’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie i was in.
25521,Penny,you know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.
24035,Penny,"the reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that i had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts i’ve ever seen in, like, ever."
29152,Penny,"hey, if you’re still looking to make money, i will pay you to burn that jacket."
29124,Penny,please? i went to your boring thing last month.

27118,Penny,"what? no, that’s not what i’m saying."
23201,Penny,"hang on. sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?"
26954,Penny,no.
26471,Penny,"it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store."
28314,Penny,"so, was the fight really bad?"
29090,Penny,"okay, maybe i’m the one who’s sad."
29017,Penny,"hey, can i ask you a question? you’ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?"
28719,Penny,so should we talk to each other or mingle?
28548,Penny,"oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, i won a night of wine tasting from work."

25064,Penny,"you know, i’ve done this before. in kindergarten, i was supposed to marry jason sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to chelsea himmelfarb. so what did i do? hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants."
25207,Penny,what’s with him?
25103,Penny,i don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
25598,Penny,yesterday. you made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
27052,Penny,"oh, no. this face wasn’t because i didn’t get it."
24005,Penny,i’m having a tea party. what do you think’s going on? i think i might have the flu. or the plague.
27055,Penny,"no, thanks. leonard and i are just going to the funeral."
22932,Penny,"ha-ha. no, you’re not."
27381,Penny,"what? no, no, i just put it on the other hand and turn it around. keep that hand in my pocket."
23680,Penny,don’t you usually get lemonade?
24684,Penny,"oh, gee, amy, i’m sorry, i’m actually pretty busy this weekend."
28475,Penny,that’s not what the forest smells like.

26384,Penny,"i wasn’t going to get alcohol. gosh, i wonder what leonard’s doing right now. i miss him so much."
23005,Penny,"oh, it’s fun."
25944,Penny,"honey, you can’t make people like each other."
28083,Penny,what’s the matter?
24192,Penny,he’s been crying?
27604,Penny,"oh, that sounds like a good thing."
28899,Penny,"yeah, but that’s just his earth parents. we don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here."
28401,Penny,"oh, my god."
23031,Penny,okay. you know what? i see where this is going. i’m not one of you guys. i’m not a scientist. so just…
24264,Penny,"well, yeah, he’d been living with sheldon."
24760,Penny,"well, i thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises. you know, get our bodies warmed up a little."
26676,Penny,ah.
22774,Penny,"oh, come on, everybody loves lolcats. they’re cute and they can’t spell ’cause they’re cats."
22417,Penny,"howard, here’s the difference. the possibility exists that leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over. "
24399,Penny,"wait. cybernetics is robot stuff, right?"
25308,Penny,"okay. then i’ll return the favour, and i won’t tell…"
23580,Penny,"leonard, honey, you don’t have to say thank you every time we have sex."
26122,Penny,really? interesting.
22725,Penny,"oh, yeah, no, this thing’s majorly out of order.  see? sorry."
24129,Penny,do you really want to get into this right now?
27753,Penny,"sorry, he’s really good."
28821,Penny,i don’t know.
22010,Penny,"well, maybe it’s all for the best, you know i always say, when one door closes, another one opens. "
22866,Penny,we never got to the bedroom.
26092,Penny,it’s hot when sheldon talks dirty.
23229,Penny,okay.
22696,Penny,"you know this is my day off, sheldon."
23322,Penny,"so, what do we got going on tonight, huh? playing halo watching battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?"
27979,Penny,oh. that’s so sweet of you.
22502,Penny,"leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment. "
23370,Penny,"sheldon, we’re a little busy here, so…"
27353,Penny,"well, i just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because i’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary."
26105,Penny,"all right, come on, be serious. look, you guys have been going out a long time. she would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?"
29360,Penny,hi guys.
28504,Penny,"fine, is that how you want to play this? all right, never have i ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals."
22455,Penny,"okay, how about this. you keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party i’ll point out which of my friends are easy. "
27240,Penny,"no, stop being stupid."
27091,Penny,"oh, no, it is, but i decided instead of complaining about it, i’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all."
22335,Penny,i want tickets to that please. 
25480,Penny,"no, i can’t. reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if i read more."
24629,Penny,"oh. go away, leonard."
26752,Penny,"look, i know you were just trying to help with your star wars thing. i didn’t mean to call it idiotic."
25342,Penny,what are you gonna do about your bully? are you gonna see him?
21921,Penny,so?
24520,Penny,"yeah, no, no, i-i-i got that."
23659,Penny,"how is that not talking to me like i’m an idiot? it’s my friend, it’s my couch, and it’s my freakin’ life!"
28962,Penny,"you know, raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. when i first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. i mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room."
25675,Penny,i don’t care. ask her things like are you going to take howard’s name? not who’s going to sit on who?
27619,Penny,what? she didn’t give me any puzzles.
27499,Penny,"honey, it’s christmas eve. who even knows you’re in there?"
26143,Penny,"yeah, that was the point of the story."
28882,Penny,do you really mean that?
29170,Penny,do you actually pay for that haircut?
28044,Penny,"well, i don’t want to hurt my dad. you know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding."
28173,Penny,ooh.
26180,Penny,will you be my valentine?
23033,Penny,penny.
24829,Penny,"oh, hey. what’s up?"
22704,Penny,mm-hmm.
28188,Penny,yeah.
24080,Penny,"okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and i don’t even get to keep it?"
23109,Penny,"yeah, sure, i guess."
23601,Penny,"okay, i don’t know where you’re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have."
27806,Penny,"yeah, it’s going okay, but i do miss this sometimes."
23144,Penny,would it help?
28470,Penny,"yeah. you know, i want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype."
24280,Penny,"okay, so, basically, you’re the reason i have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?"
29218,Penny,"well, you’re pretty delicate. maybe you shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard."
27718,Penny,and our butts. not hanging it.
23757,Penny,no.
22878,Penny,"i’m penny, i live across the hall. i’ve heard a lot about you."
24312,Penny,"look, i said i’m sorry. can’t u please let it go?"
28144,Penny,"oh, my god. we’ve done things on that couch."
24562,Penny,"oh, gee, dad, he’d love to, but leonard has to work in the morning."
25634,Penny,"anyway, i got a little residual cheque from my commercial and i thought, hey, how about i get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. so, sheldon, ta-da!"
27627,Penny,what?
24605,Penny,mm-hmm.
24878,Penny,oopsy.
26411,Penny,"i, i didn’t think it was a big deal."
24444,Penny,i thought you were going to talk to sheldon.
24253,Penny,"well, you don’t owe me an explanation."
25710,Penny,hey.
24219,Penny,just go.
27739,Penny,"okay, new salon topic. salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? discuss."
23462,Penny,"wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination."
27188,Penny,"i know, but she’s kind of a bully."
23769,Penny,sing “soft kitty” to me.
29032,Penny,thanks. are you ready?
26736,Penny,do you think i have what it takes to really make it as an actress?

25102,Penny,"oh, it’s no problem. it’s actually kind of nice. you reading, me reading. we’re like an old married couple."
23068,Penny,"oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn’t you? yeah. you would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills."
23560,Penny,"mmm, these are so good"
28326,Penny,i park fine.
22071,Penny,"so, how was paintball, did you have fun?"
24645,Penny,"hey, wait a minute."
23882,Penny,"well, we are known for our cheesecake. hit us again."
28968,Penny,– oh.
28281,Penny,"i don’t know. you could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she’s heard about the drug."
24003,Penny,do any of them work?
24002,Penny,"no, no, it’s probably just allergies."
29026,Penny,i don’t want to talk about it.
23246,Penny,"wait, wait, what am i going to do?"
21879,Penny,"okay, thankyou."
26870,Penny,no buts. you got to stop letting him boss you around.
23939,Penny,is he quitting his job at the university?
24142,Penny,"all right, sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?"
25996,Penny,what are you waiting for?
25029,Penny,"you know, this stuff is horrible. you want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?"
26465,Penny,"all right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. would you stop pouting? so, you picked my name. get over it."
24561,Penny,"yeah, okay, i think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening."
22161,Penny,"oh, that’s so sweet. but i’m going out dancing with a girlfriend. "
25747,Penny,"all right, who’s ready for another beer?"

24525,Penny,"all right, time to open bachelor number two."
26572,Penny,"oh, yeah, just the first one. i didn’t save them all."

23534,Penny,"morning, sheldon. come dance with me."
29403,Penny,"okay, where is he?"

22056,Penny,"wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?"
26976,Penny,"me, either."
26760,Penny,"okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?"

27108,Penny,are you done?
22550,Penny,"right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell leonard any of this. "
25589,Penny,"really, what were you hoping for?"
29232,Penny,so is this your first time dating a scientist? ‘cause i’m thinking of starting a support group.
22116,Penny,"anyway, she got here today, and she’s just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she’s slept with in omaha, which is basically every guy in omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink."
28891,Penny,you only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off.
24965,Penny,"oh, hey, amy. bernadette just texted me. howard proposed?"
26096,Penny,"yeah, but i don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the holocaust."
24344,Penny,what?

23258,Penny,i just don’t see how see can pull this off.
29076,Penny,"so, all we need to do is get sheldon knocked up."

22318,Penny,but sheldon….
22045,Penny,"yeah, you too. leonard, i didn’t know you played the cello?"
24504,Penny,"you know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there’s nothing you can do about it. for example, lisa peterson hasn’t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can’t go back and un-dry-hump someone’s boyfriend."
25607,Penny,yes. on purpose.
28628,Penny,"whew, chilly."
26335,Penny,"bernadette, sweetie, shut up."
22783,Penny,"shrimp caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays howard, and for our suddenly back on the hindu wagon raj, meatlover’s pizza, no meat. coming right up."
26902,Penny,"oh, hi."
23572,Penny,"hard to believe, but go on."
24757,Penny,what’s wrong?
22865,Penny,what?
24892,Penny,what?
23334,Penny,"oh, let’s see, how can i explain this, um, they don’t know how to use their shields."
28286,Penny,"really? oh, you’re the best husband ever."
25058,Penny,"oh. it’s, it’s not what it looks like."
24776,Penny,"so, did you get a chance to go over the scene i gave you?"
21973,Penny,"yeah, i like hanging out with you guys."
26894,Penny,"okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. they just try to clone me from my corpse, but my dna gets mixed with the ape’s dna and i end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet."
25140,Penny,"oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. that’s more of a prom thing."
24814,Penny,"oh, yeah, you, too."
26089,Penny,"oh, great. yes. and then you will see, i am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. yeah, that’s right, the slow reader used science. suck on that."
28075,Penny,"oh, i’m sorry."
28988,Penny,"so tell me, how did sheldon look with an earring?"
28339,Penny,"so, you really gonna break up with her?"
28952,Penny,"oh, of course. the annual birthday booty spectacular!"
25444,Penny,"yeah, i was gonna throw it away, but i just couldn’t."
23289,Penny,hi.
24316,Penny,"ah, cool."
28132,Penny,"amy, you’re getting a text."
22232,Penny,well i’m just asking if it’s difficult to be fighting with your best friend. 
24388,Penny,"if i’d thought of that in the first place, i could’ve saved myself this whole night."
26631,Penny,yeah. 
22534,Penny,i didn’t feel a draft. 
23333,Penny,"well, you know, it’s just that leonard and howard and raj, they aren’t like other guys. they’re special."
25092,Penny,mm-hmm?
26395,Penny,"okay, that, that’s great. you can stop trying to make me feel better now."
23348,Penny,"ugh, that’s what i was trying to avoid."
22147,Penny,thanks. 
23133,Penny,what?
23199,Penny,"what up, moon pie?"
27233,Penny,"well, a relationship is more complicated than a french fry."
25644,Penny,that was weird.
24371,Penny,"hey, here’s another possible topic of conversation. this is a big night for sheldon. right, sheldon?"
24038,Penny,sheldon’s in jail.
24995,Penny,that bitch!
28130,Penny,"okay, does everyone remember the rules? if he’s shirtless, one sip. posing with a pet, two sips. pet and shirtless, chug like it’s your job. and pull."
22027,Penny,you want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
24567,Penny,listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
28858,Penny,"oh, no, what happened?"
24876,Penny,"hey, you look great. good for you, priya. i could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look great."
22500,Penny,"well, raj can’t talk to me unless he’s drunk, and wolowitz is, you know, disgusting. "
24989,Penny,"okay, i don’t know you people. i’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my texaco card."
28020,Penny,okay.
26699,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
25087,Penny,no.
29251,Penny,"hey, you ready to go?"
25318,Penny,"good night, leonard."
22507,Penny,"alright, why don’t you just pick one at random, and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time. "
23437,Penny, sheldon.
28111,Penny,what?
21948,Penny,"in my apartment, while i was sleeping."
27270,Penny,"oh, my god. tell me, what did i do?"
24274,Penny,"okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?"
27119,Penny,"what does it matter? the point is, i’m choosing you."
22294,Penny,"how could you have gotten it from me, i’m not sick."
25296,Penny,"no, i’m talking to him because he’s cute."
23886,Penny,"oh, beverly, i can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis."
28649,Penny,"god, i thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this."
22962,Penny,"well, yeah, yeah, i guess. but look, he signed it."
25135,Penny,"all right, i got to go to work. i’ll walk down with you."
28412,Penny,"okay, this is ridiculous.  sheldon? can i come in?"
24023,Penny,i’m sorry. you sent more than one letter about that?
28804,Penny,"oh, that’s awful."
25473,Penny,what’s this?
27969,Penny,"it’s just, when we were kissing, i couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl."
22605,Penny,yeah!
27752,Penny,"no, no, i like that show. it’s got dragons and people doing it."
23881,Penny,"as long as you don’t feel it running down your pants, you’re fine."
28522,Penny,what is the problem?
23732,Penny,"clothes, sheldon. i need clothes!"
25931,Penny,"hey. sorry this took so long. but you used to work here, you know how it is."
27017,Penny,"uh, tell me more about this calzone idea."
22980,Penny,"i am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. it’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “ooh, it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that.” and most important, we are not dancing a tango, we’re not to’ing and fro’ing. nothing is ever going to happen between us. ever."
25986,Penny,ow! ow!
28684,Penny,"that’s super helpful, amy. thanks a lot. i can’t wait to do that."
27238,Penny,‘cause it’s stupid. who cares what number it is?
28054,Penny,"hey, daddy."
28058,Penny,very. leonard is so great.
29193,Penny,"oh, you met him at the office christmas party. he’s married to nancy."
27175,Penny,they do?
23721,Penny,"yeah, okay, whatever. will you just turn the water off and help me up?"
29231,Penny,"hey, i already set up howard and bernadette. it’s your turn to ruin some poor girl’s life."
26209,Penny,"you’re kidding, right? we’re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?"
25425,Penny,how would you say it?
26856,Penny,how is everything?
23279,Penny,"not with a thousand condoms, howard."
24100,Penny,"yeah, so?"
23918,Penny,and astrology.
22493,Penny,wow.
27694,Penny,because i beat you.
25163,Penny,"what do you mean, vastly wealthy?"
29234,Penny,"oh, is that offer for everybody?"
25509,Penny,ouch.
28695,Penny,hi.
26137,Penny,"and since you love the truth so much, why don’t you tell amy you don’t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?"
21918,Penny,"i’m so sorry, i really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass."
25141,Penny,put the corsage on her.
24807,Penny,"he still won’t shag the old lady, huh?"
26928,Penny,i’m gonna need another clue.
25855,Penny,i hope so.
26354,Penny,"and, uh, extra dramamine? you remember what happened on it’s a small world."
27837,Penny,"just let me see. sweetie, you know you’re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown."
26290,Penny,"relax, sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late."
27316,Penny,"uh, it’s kind of a lot. you know, let me do a little tonight, and i’ll catch up with you guys later."
26724,Penny,"okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it."
22333,Penny,"wow, so in your world, you’re like, the cool guys. "
26621,Penny,"yes, it is."
27035,Penny,"fine, i’ll go. hmm. people turn to you for guidance and wisdom. yeah, that’s a good one."
22978,Penny,"look, normally i can just ignore you. i mean, i get it, you’re a little peculiar. you know, like sheldon."
26350,Penny,"well, here we are."
25317,Penny,ooh. maybe i like it.
23131,Penny,a hugging machine?
22992,Penny,"and say what? that i didn’t mean it, because i meant it."
27406,Penny,doesn’t matter. prom is silly anyways.
22079,Penny,sure.
24625,Penny,really?
22371,Penny,"yeah, okay, neat, but i really got to get to work, so…."
24094,Penny,did i see x-men?
26273,Penny,"yippee, it’s backwards. i get it."
26495,Penny,i don’t get it.
26956,Penny,"no, i didn’t get it."
22613,Penny,"no sheldon, i’d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old."
28103,Penny,really? in a comic book store?
27648,Penny,"you know what? i can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will i drive you there, i will buy you all the dragon t-shirts you want."
24881,Penny,"aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can’t figure out how i got his nose."
23953,Penny,"oh, what a gentleman. hey, sheldon. "
28511,Penny,what good is it if you don’t use it?
26125,Penny,"well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings."
27622,Penny,why would she even do this?
24091,Penny,just sit.
23755,Penny,i dislocated my shoulder.
25433,Penny,no talking.
27301,Penny,"okay, good night, guys."
26063,Penny,what was that for?
25049,Penny,when a suitcase just won’t do.
28334,Penny,come in.
24563,Penny,"no, no, no, you can’t. your career is far too important."
21912,Penny,"uh, i’m sorry, do you speak english?"
22460,Penny,"that’s my friend carol. remind me, i’ve got to introduce her to howard. "
24630,Penny,it’s open.
22649,Penny,"okay, i’m at the gate to the treasury of the ancients, i’m going in."
22645,Penny,i don’t work on mondays.
22578,Penny,they have other things.
24104,Penny,it’s ridiculous.
29348,Penny,what?
23042,Penny,don’t be silly.
24678,Penny,"oh, you’re welcome."
28603,Penny,"to be honest, i’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all."
25093,Penny,hi. you guys have a minute?
28354,Penny,you don’t have to call me ma’am.
25396,Penny,"you mean, like a date?"
25202,Penny,"hey, they have wine here, don’t they?"
24719,Penny,"well, howard’s a complete and total ass, bernadette’s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke amy’s hair, she bites."
23128,Penny,"i mean, do you know where i was all morning? auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. and for what? so i’ll finally get my daddy’s approval?"
24611,Penny,"wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you’re ditching me to go look at comic books?"
26492,Penny,but wait. so does this one.
21967,Penny,"is, is everything okay."
28874,Penny,"uh, did you notice your key chain?"
29103,Penny,"yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out."
22924,Penny,"now, honey, it’s okay.you don’t have to get me anything in return."
24803,Penny,"leonard, are you okay?"
28619,Penny,"oh, you have to invite him. i haven’t seen him since the divorce."
25690,Penny,what’s with the robe?
27725,Penny,"my baby is sad, and i’m gonna make him happy again."
29051,Penny,"hey, can you hold off redoing the room? my brother’s coming out here in a few weeks."
22425,Penny,nice. i got him a sweater. 
28760,Penny,ugh. can we just have sex?
22256,Penny,"oh, too bad, well, i got to get to rehearsal, see you guys. "
21919,Penny,"really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific. why don’t you put some clothes on, i’ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?"
27814,Penny,okay.
28964,Penny,"hey, i bought m&ms at the vending machine and two bags came out."
26306,Penny,"i’m sorry, why old?"
26470,Penny,"okay, it’s not gonna say that."
29008,Penny,"what, what’s all this?"
27025,Penny,"well you know what? maybe i need a break from all of you. come on, sheldon."
27993,Penny,i don’t know.
29078,Penny,"all right, you know what you need? a night away from all of this. you know, where you can just kind of relax and, i’m just gonna turn this off. much better. seriously, let’s plan a night, you know, give you a break. we could go dancing."
25175,Penny,"raj, come here. this girl is trouble. i mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?"
28759,Penny,"really? you’re a genius, and that’s the first thing you come up with?"
24386,Penny,"okay, you know what? i’m gonna come at this in a whole new way. sheldon, if you try to make a baby with amy in a petri dish, i’m gonna tell your mother on you."
26559,Penny,"damn it, everyone’s better at this than me."
27777,Penny,thanks a lot.
24901,Penny,"oh, that’s, hot, hot, hot, hot! whoo! it really sneaks up on ya, huh? all right, i gotta go."
27236,Penny,"no, don’t."
23964,Penny,"hey, you know what, leonard, i know i said i could handle your roommate, but i was wrong. we’re going to have to break up."
28669,Penny,"okay, i understand everyone’s a little tense today, so i am just gonna get to the important stuff. leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. but also how incredibly happy you make me. thank you for marrying me. hopefully for the last time."
27935,Penny,why would we want that?
25878,Penny,sharp. thanks to the machine we saw earlier.
27561,Penny,"you’re right, we can’t."
24467,Penny,"uh, not that i know of. hey, while we’re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?"
23361,Penny,"that’s so sweet, but what if i didn’t like it?"
22838,Penny,"well, that depends."
27455,Penny,"yeah, once he figures out how to work a door."
29059,Penny,"no, it’s my brother’s. i’m trying to help him get a job out here."
25315,Penny,"i don’t know. up until the last part, i was kind of enjoying take-charge leonard with a little backbone. picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky."
23523,Penny,"i don’t know, empathy? anyway, i’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with howard, and i’m upset about something with leonard."
27306,Penny,yes. i’ll check flights.
25188,Penny,mm-hmm.
26731,Penny,"yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? people were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. more auditions, more parts. now none of that’s gonna happen."
23177,Penny,what the hell?
27231,Penny,"uh, we’re not sure. but i want to wait long enough to prove to my mother i’m not pregnant."
27026,Penny,"we’re gonna have anything can happen thursday, you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and i’m gonna complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do."
22281,Penny,"i have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it? "
25963,Penny,nothing.
22598,Penny,"sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…"
24469,Penny,"yeah, that’s what i’m counting on. spill."
25930,Penny,that’s better.
23694,Penny,"that isn’t even your problem, the problem is you don’t trust me!"
28484,Penny,i can see that. what team did you get?
25359,Penny,i actually knew that.
26758,Penny,"ooh. leonard hofstadter, will you marry me?"
28811,Penny,just finish your ice cream so i can get you home to bed.
22343,Penny,okay. what artificial satellite has seen glimpses of einsteins predicted frame dragging? 
26917,Penny,disgusting. do not tell him.
26991,Penny,"you have to have the courage to end the relationship. you know? break it off, shake hands, walk away."
23015,Penny,thanks! i mean the e-mail doesn’t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
24419,Penny,"hey, what’s my share?"
28065,Penny,when?
25257,Penny,"oh, god. amy!"
24034,Penny,do i have a choice?
29180,Penny,"all right, so we’ll ask him to come back."
26328,Penny,on a ship? aren’t they afraid hawking will just roll overboard?
26234,Penny,i know.
28914,Penny,"you liked my short hair, right?"
28722,Penny,"wait, what do you mean she’s her?"
29510,Penny,"oh, the boys had to drive all the way to san bernardino for the solder and got a flat."
29120,Penny,"wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? because look."
28007,Penny,i want to believe you. i really do. am i being naive?
25019,Penny,"hang on a second, you picked up your mother? her own legs are barely able to do that."
26392,Penny,"really? that, that’s it? that’s comforting?"
21984,Penny,"really, nothing?"
28822,Penny,i guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.
25105,Penny,"it’s great, isn’t it?"
24655,Penny,"seriously, i have a great idea for one."
29206,Penny,"well, why wouldn’t this be a safe place? i mean, he’s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends."
24640,Penny,"who, me?"
24618,Penny,all right. let’s get this thing over with.
23894,Penny,what the hell happened to lovely and charming?
28392,Penny,"hey, guys. congratulations."
26119,Penny,"yeah. okay, all right, don’t freak out. you can make this work."
25164,Penny,"well, so how much is that?"
22336,Penny,"good afternoon, and welcome to today’s physics bowl practice round. i’m penny, and i’ll be your host, because apparently i didn’t have anything else to do on a saturday afternoon, and isn’t that just a little sad? gentlemen, are you ready?"
29178,Penny,i feel terrible.
27215,Penny,"okay, good. she seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight."
26828,Penny,"no, i think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home."
26620,Penny,there’s a girl at the cheesecake factory i can set you up with.
24570,Penny,no.
24828,Penny,i didn’t do the audition.
27478,Penny,"uh, well, you know your private bathroom?"
23531,Penny,it would take the pressure off.
25260,Penny,damn it. should have liberated the iffy chicken. what are you and professor fussyface up to tonight?
24476,Penny,"oh, gee, howard, i really don’t want to get in the middle of this."
29467,Penny,who do we love?
28126,Penny,"okay, here we go. now everyone can see. all right. where do we stand on cross-eyed mike?"
28796,Penny,"well, who you gonna hit on? the girl in front of us got strawberry. that’s your favourite."
22592,Penny,your arch enemy?
28518,Penny,"doesn’t matter what i want. look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. so i’m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through."
28954,Penny,"all right, well, you two go have fun."
23802,Penny,womenfolk?
26879,Penny,are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
25197,Penny,"oh, fine. you know, it’s been a while. i’m getting back out there."
29093,Penny,"pressure. i mean, she’s looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401k. before she talked about it, i just thought that was a race."
28317,Penny,and there’s your next t-shirt.
25279,Penny,"okay, we were going out. you were going to get sex anyway."
27089,Penny,hi.
24518,Penny,yeah?
21939,Penny,"yeah, i do like the one where lois lane falls from the helicopter and superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that? "
27295,Penny,"no, no. no need to apologise."
22614,Penny,for god’s sake! 
23247,Penny,"oh, okay, cool. i’m going to take a nap."
23857,Penny,"no, it’s fine. look, sir isaac can go right next to this little candy cane."
25964,Penny,did your boyfriend make you type that?
27157,Penny,it might be good for him.
26625,Penny,that would explain why the sky was also on its side.
29496,Penny,ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh! 
24939,Penny,i’m gonna show you how we finish a quest in nebraska. oh. beyonce.  this ain’t no beyonce.
25032,Penny,"it’s like he’s trying to win a prize. a word of advice, don’t doze off. you will never hear the end of it."
26884,Penny,"oh, sheldon, wait."
27158,Penny,he’s a grown man.
28625,Penny,"okay, wait, you’re inviting people to our wedding?"
28350,Penny,i’m still sleeping with you tonight.
25811,Penny,"well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking."
26316,Penny,"more potion, please."
24452,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
29160,Penny,what’s it for?
27893,Penny,"oh, my god. yes. why would you even ask that?"
28969,Penny,"oh, look at all the babies."
27547,Penny,"yeah, clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector."
29003,Penny,"yeah, with gasoline and a match? sure."
28296,Penny,"and not only am i leonard’s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named sheldon."
22954,Penny,it’s just rum. it stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
23913,Penny,thank you. would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?
28088,Penny,"hang on. wait, you actually think it’s 2003?"
22289,Penny,maybe friday.
23588,Penny,"um, i have a question."
27304,Penny,want to go to vegas this weekend?
23277,Penny,we’re all out.
23218,Penny,"so, what do you think? i mean, this could be a business, right?"
27489,Penny,"yes, we did."
24864,Penny,"okay, let’s go through this one more time. just because leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean i need to go out and hook up with some guy."
27653,Penny,you sure that’s your choice? ‘cause i’ve had that dinner.
22949,Penny,dave is not smarter than you. he’s an idiot.
25215,Penny,yes.
26896,Penny,"okay, i don’t think meryl streep ever had to say “must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”"
22952,Penny,"and you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?"
24998,Penny,what?
24492,Penny,sheldon?
27096,Penny,"i love you, too. but i’m afraid i love killing more. like, one day, i might actually try and kill you."

29501,Penny,"doctor, please help me. i think i might be turning into a killer gorilla."
26313,Penny,"you know what? give me the dice, i want to roll."
27084,Penny,this isn’t funny anymore. just say no so we’re done with this. will you marry me or not?
28876,Penny,and what? your wizard robes are next to go.
22356,Penny,"alright, singer who sang “oops i did it again.”  okay, tweetie bird, taught he taw a what?"
26305,Penny,"i got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these."
28186,Penny,"oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars."
27283,Penny,it’s not.
27477,Penny,yeah. it comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.
27580,Penny,it is; it truly is.
25380,Penny,"well, just smile and think about koalas."
24837,Penny,how about howard?
26967,Penny,"oh, that’s sad."
25233,Penny,"through no one’s fault, sheldon, we’re leaving."
23563,Penny,"yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet."

26379,Penny,okay.
29222,Penny,"i don’t know, check your body for tattoos?"
27101,Penny,"you know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass."
23565,Penny,"so, what are you guys doing?"
28503,Penny,how?
22657,Penny,thank you.

28306,Penny,you really don’t know why?
22936,Penny,"since always. call me a geek, but i am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing."
28294,Penny,"how can i not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with star wars toys? i mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed wookiee watching you?"
27276,Penny,you told emily we hooked up?
27470,Penny,"no. that’s fine, but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper."
28395,Penny,"yeah, yeah. i was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box."
22929,Penny,hi. penny. so it’s your motorcycle?
26608,Penny,"hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?"
29276,Penny,"look, we can have a reasonable conversation and i won’t get mad. i don’t like it after sex, and i don’t like it now."
24826,Penny,i’m fine.
27061,Penny,i’ve never been to a funeral before.
25449,Penny,"yeah, just hang on, sheldon. you know why we can’t be together? because you always have to be right."
22454,Penny,"okay, i don’t need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer. "
23794,Penny,"hey, leonard, check this out. "
23985,Penny,is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
24865,Penny,"well, yeah, i guess."
23321,Penny,yes
26679,Penny,yeah.
28148,Penny,what?
27763,Penny,"yeah, so, how many people listen?"
26166,Penny,"oh, come on, don’t make this about you."
22029,Penny,are we so sure that’s a bad thing?
27468,Penny,"yes, but once in a while, people think you’re a little mean."
22661,Penny,"no, no, no, no, i need you now."
28658,Penny,what?
23672,Penny,"well, that’s not gonna happen."
28197,Penny,"yeah, leonard and i are gonna be cooking all day."
24327,Penny,"are you telling me, for the past four months i have been asking you what’s new and you never thought to go with sheldon has a girlfriend?"
25443,Penny,"okay, great. hey, i just remembered. i still got one of your inhalers."
21949,Penny,and what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
23452,Penny,"oh, hey, no, you don’t have to apologize. there’s no reason you have to tell me. i was just, you know, surprised."
23183,Penny,"it’s kind of a funny name, though, smoot."
24960,Penny,"oh, that gossipy bitch! no offense."
28741,Penny,"okay, you guys had sex one whole time. nothing can put out a fire like that."
25352,Penny,"no, it was funny. everyone laughed."
27179,Penny,but i don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals.
26208,Penny,"i work at the cheesecake factory, i said bye."
28662,Penny,i thought it was really funny.
24646,Penny,hang on. let’s see where he’s going.
27899,Penny,sounds perfect.
27485,Penny,"me, too."
28854,Penny,"i can’t believe i’m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?"
21964,Penny,"guys, it’s hot in here, i think i’ll just take off all my clothes. "
28667,Penny,hey.
27267,Penny,"it has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive."
24856,Penny,what’s up?
24349,Penny,"sheldon, did it ever occur to you that i might have other plans?"
22233,Penny,wait… what? 
22651,Penny,22
25238,Penny,"i know. me, too. we’ll talk to her. hey, wait, how did she find out?"
23241,Penny,"well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in old town."
23407,Penny,what?
28106,Penny,yeah.
26421,Penny,"oh, my god. you weren’t supposed to be here till sunday."
25051,Penny,"what? oh, god, yeah. yeah. leonard’s a noisy little dude in the sack."
23908,Penny,"oh, got it. thank you for educating me."
25626,Penny,"sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…"
22443,Penny,"oh, i know i’m going to regret this but, what trauma? "
23764,Penny,ass.
28437,Penny,"sheldon, did you draft the contract?"
27331,Penny,"i’m sorry, i was thinking about work."
23096,Penny,no.
25166,Penny,"what? he paid off her credit cards? damn it, i could’ve dated raj for a couple months. but i, i wouldn’t have, because i’m not that kind of girl. we should really talk to raj."
23816,Penny,"great! it’s a little insulting, but great. i’ll be koko."
23507,Penny,fine? you said it was fine?
22692,Penny,"yeah, uh, i really don’t think i do."
26039,Penny,"oh, damn it, you are."
26355,Penny,okay.
27665,Penny,you’re all alike.
22391,Penny,"uh, pretty much, why?"
29018,Penny,"well, leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants."
25662,Penny,"i know what it means. and yes, you love correcting people and putting them down."
28681,Penny,i didn’t mean to. it just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. i…
25104,Penny,i want a divorce.
23389,Penny,"are you trying to make small talk? oh, sweetie, you really don’t have to."
26832,Penny,"hey, same goes for the two of you with amy."
27649,Penny,yup. be right there. i assume you don’t want wine.
24265,Penny,"okay, and after all that, you just moved in?"
26367,Penny,"oh, me, too."
29175,Penny,now you’re taking her side?
25353,Penny,"uh, probably. it’s hard to say. she kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth."
28595,Penny,"you know, she’s my mother-in-law. why can’t i bond with her like that?"
22604,Penny,"yes, i can’t get my stupid door open."
29484,Penny,"…when i was a very young girl. when i was 16 years old, i made the discovery, love. all at once, and much, much too completely. it was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. that’s how it struck the world for me. but i was unlucky. deluded."
23561,Penny,what?
28823,Penny,"oh, yeah."
27952,Penny,"really, we’re good."
25154,Penny,"um, raj, there’s someone i want you to meet. this is my friend emily. i know her from my spin class. raj, relax. she can’t hear you. she’s deaf."
27166,Penny,"hey, what’s going on?"
22298,Penny,we have chicken tortilla and potato leek. 
23499,Penny,sure.
22478,Penny,"‘cause i do that, i do overreact. maybe i should call mike and apologise."
25643,Penny,"yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it."
27296,Penny,"okay, sit down. listen, emily, what happened between me and raj was a long time ago."
27817,Penny,"uh, yeah, i just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes."
22773,Penny,i did?
25976,Penny,"yeah. so, how you doing?"
28986,Penny,"stop. okay. they told mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head."
27336,Penny,what?
27634,Penny,unbelievable.
25356,Penny,"uh-huh. uh-huh. oh, god, just finish the sentence. okay, well, i’m sorry you feel that way. bye. no one wants to hear my apologies."
24730,Penny,yes.
25365,Penny,"yeah, well, i bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. you know, giving really is better than receiving. i used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away."
27193,Penny,i thought your phone got stolen.
25768,Penny,"what do you want, sheldon?"
25299,Penny,you should.
22211,Penny,"here, why don’t you put these on while i find a shirt and sport-coat to match. "
29261,Penny,"right, ’cause it spells menu."
22393,Penny,"what do you want, howard?"
24412,Penny,"all right, let’s start with a toe touch. okay, you do it."
28798,Penny,is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
23365,Penny,"it’s friday night, that means chinese food and vintage video games, right?"
23644,Penny,no.
26923,Penny,that kind of actress. this sucks.
27262,Penny,hey.
27287,Penny,it’s stupid.
25945,Penny,you might want to pace yourself.
25405,Penny,"absolutely not. look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes."
25883,Penny,take off your clothes.
22495,Penny,yes. 
28626,Penny,"okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?"
24627,Penny,"good-bye, sheldon."
24237,Penny,"oh, good, you’re up. look, my car won’t start. i need a ride to work."
22930,Penny,"oh, is it okay?"
28614,Penny,"yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family."
23689,Penny,my singing?
23827,Penny,not for twenty six hundred years.
25162,Penny,"wait, hang on. doubles. roll again."
26376,Penny,mmm.
24489,Penny,"yeah, that’ll hold me for a while."
27559,Penny,"now, you just get comfortable."
22515,Penny,not the first one i’ve made today. 
24529,Penny,"okay. well, i guess we’re having a slumber party. oh!"
27656,Penny,"yeah, why?"
23548,Penny,"um, yeah, sure, thanks."
24172,Penny,"no, this isn’t fair to you, leonard. i’m sorry."
28388,Penny,no.
24890,Penny,"she seems really sweet. believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. there are a lot of bitches out there."
25375,Penny,that is so hot.
28125,Penny,hey.
21917,Penny,"oh, my god, what happened?"
25846,Penny,why not?
22334,Penny,zod?
28776,Penny,"believe me, we know what you’re going through."
25088,Penny,also no.
23445,Penny,what?
23813,Penny,sure. i did the one with the frogs.
28577,Penny,"oh, that’s a venn diagram, and i remember because i thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?"
25485,Penny,"okay, you’re kind of really great."
26791,Penny,"and hold three, two, one. very good. now let’s try warrior 2. and hold."
26564,Penny,"okay, i gave this a lot of thought, and i finally found something to show you how much i love you."
24921,Penny,"yeah, well, sadly, i do."
25270,Penny,"no, i was talking to the bird."
27054,Penny,okay.
25259,Penny,yeah. i’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. do you know how to cook it?
21931,Penny,i’m sorry?
27445,Penny,i think she meant something a little happier.
28908,Penny,"this is getting old fast, dolores, knock it off."
28015,Penny,"you know what i mean. and, you know, maybe the way i’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too."
22359,Penny,what is it?
29053,Penny,"well, i sell pharmaceuticals. that’s just a really hard to spell word for drugs."
25534,Penny,how about i tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?
28592,Penny,uncomfortable.
26715,Penny,"guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this."
27910,Penny,yeah. this is crazy.
22907,Penny,"so, you told her you wanted to slow things down?"
26634,Penny,"no, they’re not."
28740,Penny,"yeah, and we’ll be right across the hall."
23167,Penny,why not?
23442,Penny, sheldon.
29407,Penny,sheldon?
28547,Penny,is he still wearing the batman suit under the man-bat suit?
28802,Penny,not relating. go on.
28826,Penny,who’s that?
28076,Penny,"if it makes you feel any better, i pierced amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet."
29464,Penny,"so it is an amazing documentary. they need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment."
29477,Penny,"yeah, everybody’s happy, great."
28271,Penny,i don’t know. he said he’s ready.
22017,Penny,"let’s say 4,390. "
25119,Penny,"what’s the word, hummingbird?"
24816,Penny,okay. why?
26713,Penny,you guys need anything else?
24098,Penny,"it’ll give you confidence. you know, sometimes when i’m feeling all stressed out about something, i go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and i have a whole new outlook on life."
23686,Penny,leonard is wrong.
22799,Penny,"i don’t care, i was in junior rodeo, i can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds."
28429,Penny,"come on, just open it."
29166,Penny,hi.
28080,Penny,"uh, well, honey, you know, now that leonard and i are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together."
27847,Penny,"aw, it’s so nice. she’s gonna love it."
25039,Penny,oh!
24058,Penny,you’re extorting a date out of me?
22674,Penny,"of course i would, i would be honoured."
22419,Penny,"okay, sweetie, i understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw leonard a birthday party. "
27999,Penny,"okay, look, i might be overreacting, but how am i supposed to get past this when i know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?"
27588,Penny,"maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. a man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings."
28492,Penny,no.
25962,Penny,mm-hmm. hmm.
27936,Penny,whatever. put us on the internet. i’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.
26147,Penny,"you know, sometimes i think i’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that."
26133,Penny,yeah. and who knows how amy will react.
29240,Penny,"bert, you’re a good guy, you deserve a woman who’s interested in more than just your money."
28771,Penny,damn. 
23233,Penny,"pretty good, right?"
22032,Penny,"oh my god, this is the best cobbler i’ve ever had."
23518,Penny,"oh, sweetie. you really can’t hold your liquor, can you?"
25307,Penny,yeah. wears them. not just for halloween.
26859,Penny,no.
22284,Penny,did you get my mail.
24422,Penny,"it’s not free, i’m gonna pay him back.  shut up!"
25056,Penny,"nothing, nothing. you know, if we weren’t friends, and you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story, i’d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy."
27921,Penny,"nope, never."
23877,Penny,you know what? i could use a drink. do you want to stop for a drink?
28610,Penny,"ugh, i should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains black history month."
27820,Penny,so it’s not really like that?
28382,Penny,"okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. we can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub."
26337,Penny,what the hell?
27075,Penny,what’s that?
25813,Penny,can we go now?
29086,Penny,is everything okay?
28984,Penny,yeah. go ahead.
25435,Penny,"you hung in there, though."
25475,Penny,oh.
22887,Penny,"okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?"
22662,Penny,"whatever, i’ll figure it out myself."
24251,Penny,i found these in the dryer. i’m assuming they belong to sheldon.
26686,Penny,"hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?"
26249,Penny,"oh, not really. i was out shopping with amy. she wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing."
24136,Penny,ice cream?
22740,Penny,sorry.   holy crap on a cracker.
23900,Penny,"well, the last big thing i did was this production of diary of anne frank above a bowling alley. but i think things might be turning around pretty soon."
28754,Penny,"now, now, there’s no need to make this emotional."
23385,Penny,"well, i went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren’t home, and i forgot it there."
27479,Penny,that was supposed to be for the whole floor.
23061,Penny,what are you saying? that i’m using my body to get dinner? that i’m some kind of chinese food prostitute?
24782,Penny,"okay, that’s fine, but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone."
27538,Penny,"yeah, have fun."
28357,Penny,"just shut up, glen. come on, let’s get out of here."
26207,Penny,"yeah, that’s a toughie."
29381,Penny,him.
29347,Penny,you came into my apartment last night when i was sleeping?
29184,Penny,then it’s settled.
27207,Penny,i’m sorry. i just need a little break from her.
21893,Penny,"oh, yeah, i’m a waitress at the cheesecake factory."
27374,Penny,"no, i think you should do whatever you want. you know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, i would’ve become a theoretical physicist. stop smirking at each other."
26157,Penny,"no, you’re totally right. she could be skinny ’cause she’s dying."
27352,Penny,"oh, thank you so much. it feels so good to hear you say that. and i want you to know that i get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and i’m trying to be sensitive to that."
26282,Penny,"it is, isn’t it?"
27670,Penny,"if you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?"
22690,Penny,"oh, sweetie, it’s okay. "
26640,Penny,want of understanding? what does that even mean?
29436,Penny,hey. is the food here? ooh. what’s that?
28956,Penny,"well, i didn’t until i heard that."
27704,Penny,yeah.
28867,Penny,"i did, still a mess."
27433,Penny,thank you for wearing your heels.
23399,Penny,"sheldon, i really don’t want to talk about this with you."
24902,Penny,"oh, hey, i was just on my way to work."
29277,Penny,"yeah. all right, just come here. look, i get me working with zack is weird and i don’t want you to be uncomfortable. "
22170,Penny,"well, i finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so i need to practice making drinks."
23760,Penny,no.
23513,Penny,"don’t talk, just drink."
26871,Penny,"see? right there. you’re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. wish you wouldn’t, but one problem at a time."
29444,Penny,"hey, can i talk to you out here for a sec?"
26140,Penny,you’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.
25656,Penny,it’s not saturday night. why are you doing your laundry?
27289,Penny,what’s up?
29089,Penny,i don’t know. this is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.
22647,Penny,"yeah, get to the point, i’m about to level up here."
25303,Penny,"oh, he had to leave."
23150,Penny,what?
28612,Penny,"yeah, and when i dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug."
27431,Penny,"well, i might not have asked you to dance then, but i will ask you now."
24255,Penny,"oh, i’m judging you nine ways to sunday, but you don’t owe me an explanation."
26264,Penny,what’s wrong with cute?
22781,Penny,i’m banished? what the hell kind of crap is that?
23297,Penny,"well, sort of."
23795,Penny,you want me to put it back?
26921,Penny,are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?
22588,Penny,"third floor tonight. mixing it up?  oh. you know, i still don’t understand why you just don’t go to dinner or something."
28217,Penny,no. i never told anyone that. but i did write it in my journal.
29495,Penny,"hey, leonard. guess who’s back. dr. lorvis. yeah. you care to join us? what? you locked them in your basement?"
25184,Penny,"oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. we all know you’re loaded now."
24621,Penny,okay. you know what? i changed my mind. i’m not going.
25144,Penny,"okay, i’m sorry, what exactly happened?"
27201,Penny,what happens if you don’t?
23147,Penny,"hello, sheldon."
24338,Penny,"okay, look, don’t think of it as dating a girlfriend. think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child."
28624,Penny,i was kind of hoping you would.
28525,Penny,"well, i will still come to your meeting."
24755,Penny,forget it.
26025,Penny,"wait, what the hell’s going on with leonard and alex?"
27142,Penny,sorry. i’ll get better.
24846,Penny,"oh, the horror."
23011,Penny,he slipped and fell.
27721,Penny,"if it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?"
25581,Penny,"it was a long story. anyway, sheldon, i promise i know what i’m doing. please let me cut your hair."
22898,Penny,"okay, leonard, honey, you know, if you’re uncomfortable with the way things are going, you’re allowed to say something."
28247,Penny,"okay, look, i know amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her."
27794,Penny,"well, why?"
23860,Penny,why were you keeping this a secret?
25590,Penny,"okay, i’m an actress. ask me again."
27862,Penny,"i know, i know. zzzzzzzz."
22467,Penny,tell me the truth. am i just an idiot who picks giant losers? 
28241,Penny,who cares?
28259,Penny,"okay, well, what’s the third option?"
26013,Penny,"wow, you should come to girls’ night more often. and not just because if you weren’t here, this would be a can of pabst."
27109,Penny,it was for haemorrhoid cream.
28843,Penny,hello.
21986,Penny,"oh, uh, not much. we do have a chocolate key lime that’s moving pretty well. "
26214,Penny,"i can explain. i played hooky with the girls, then we all went to disneyland and got… what are you doing?"
27696,Penny,okay.
25830,Penny,"once again, unbelievable."
22639,Penny,"well, wear different pyjamas."
24521,Penny,"uh, just wear something comfortable."
27655,Penny,"uh, well, i’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing."
22150,Penny,what the hell is your problem?
24915,Penny,hey.
22164,Penny,"look, why don’t i play with you guys tomorrow?"
27505,Penny,"well, did you tell him that?"
28791,Penny,"you know, one night, leonard’s nose whistled so loud, i swear it was like sleeping on a train track."
27318,Penny,yeah.
27123,Penny,"you, you stupid pop-tart."
27156,Penny,"leonard, hang on. just come here. maybe we need to let him go."
26773,Penny,i already quit.
27938,Penny,what’s going on?
28416,Penny,"that’s fine. you know, i hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. but what i hate even more is, if i was there, i would have tortured you, too."
28825,Penny,"okay. leonard, it’s sweet you’re excited about this, but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph."
27539,Penny,and you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.
25138,Penny,really? for a wedding?
25970,Penny,"then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?"
26971,Penny,"unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn’t a big deal."
23351,Penny,"oh, great."
24863,Penny,"oh, yeah, i know that place. what do you think?"
25603,Penny,who’s armin the miniature horse breeder?
26443,Penny,no.
26371,Penny,aw.
24447,Penny,"well, you defended me, right?"
27930,Penny,"okay, that’s enough. stop talking."
26719,Penny,"um, i play a customer in a diner and i flirt with mark harmon."
28201,Penny,"sweetie, you are grown up."
28380,Penny,"uh, i don’t know, a bar?"
28177,Penny,good luck. i threw out all my tall ones when i married leonard.
22813,Penny,"look, you’ve got to meet me halfway here."
28046,Penny,"well, not necessarily. you know, dad’s not getting any younger, so if i wait long enough, i’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical."
27607,Penny,"all right, well, if i’m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, i’m thinking you might have to let this one go."
27102,Penny,"yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. you used to be famous."
21888,Penny,do you want me to move?
23841,Penny,because i’m stupid!
25146,Penny,"yeah, i’m sure he’ll be okay."
26595,Penny,i scraped gum off the bottom of that table. only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.
28978,Penny,mm.
25079,Penny,"come here. just listen to me. i want to go back to the way we were before. you know, friends. no sprinkles."
23605,Penny,"oh, great thing about ernie, was he never asked me for anything. he just gave."
23030,Penny,"sheldon, are you okay?"
25659,Penny,"yeah, yeah, i know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time."
27177,Penny,i wish i felt more confident.
28985,Penny,"oh, it’s no problem, amy and sheldon were just telling us about their trip to texas."
22353,Penny,"van halen. alright, madonna was married to this ridgemont high alum.  oh my god, sean penn!"
28772,Penny,the new neighbours are weird.
25611,Penny,"oh, come on. they’re playing one across the hall, we should, too. okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. then you get to go again…"
22097,Penny,"kurt, put him down this instant. "
28981,Penny,that’s too loud.
25186,Penny,"no, no, no, no, i didn’t forget. um, there’s this cat in a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both. although, back in nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there."
26653,Penny,we don’t have any kids.
25614,Penny,wars.
22627,Penny,"yeah, okay. listen, i need to talk to sheldon."
27093,Penny,go away. just go away.
26881,Penny,"oh, please. when i first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. now you’re holding hands, you’re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train."
28189,Penny,"what, now you’re interested? you didn’t even want to come."
26918,Penny,"oh, my god, you guys need to do something!"
29243,Penny,i didn’t know you could drink while you’re breastfeeding.
24356,Penny,no.
24806,Penny,what was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?
21911,Penny,it’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.
28839,Penny,been hearing that a lot today.
28617,Penny,"hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for us. we could keep it small and informal. this time we can invite our families."
22602,Penny,because love trumps hate.
28246,Penny,why?
28916,Penny,"you know, how come nobody’s talking about howard’s dopey haircut?"
25206,Penny,oh. yeah. that’s gone. it’s a rough month when halloween and pms hit at the same time.
22892,Penny,oh hey.
24969,Penny,"okay, suit yourself. we’ll probably be trashing priya a little."
28958,Penny,"hey, bernadette’s water broke."
24668,Penny,okay. what if i got him to apologize and promise to behave?
23750,Penny,"it’s not going to explode, just keep driving. warp speed ahead, mr. spock."
26878,Penny,me?
28456,Penny,"okay, so what is solder?"
29512,Penny,"guys, wake up. bernadette’s having her baby."
24256,Penny,i’m listening.
26889,Penny,"yeah, let’s go."
26162,Penny,"what, so i’m the wrong person? maybe you want to be with gretchen, too."
27726,Penny,"well, what about this helicopter you control with an ipad?"
24063,Penny,are you stan lee?
21884,Penny,holy smokes.
24654,Penny,"hey, you don’t need leonard and his app. you can make one with me."
28715,Penny,"oh, i’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap i don’t understand. i mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?"
26235,Penny,"we were all thinking it, really. it was kind of the elephant in the room, so…"
27167,Penny,oh.
22055,Penny,"oh, come on, you know, leonard’s had girls over before, right?"
27243,Penny,it does?
24209,Penny,"oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to disneyland next saturday and sheldon wants to come."
24420,Penny,"okay, can i get you after friday when i get paid?"
25469,Penny,"uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?"
26487,Penny,it’s just a bunch of pants.
29426,Penny,leonard!
26619,Penny,so you can send it to princeton and get your money back.
25474,Penny,"well, that’s quite a list you got there."
29142,Penny,"no, it’s fine, i know you don’t like the way i drive."
25010,Penny,"it’s not a big deal, sheldon. it’s just, ever since leonard’s been dating raj’s sister, i’ve had to keep my distance. i don’t get to hear all your jibber-jabber."
23053,Penny,yes.
25820,Penny,"so, how was work today?"
23305,Penny,yeah.
27782,Penny,in a safe place.
23304,Penny,"oh, this? i’m dressed like a slob today."
23987,Penny,"it’s not over, is it?"
28258,Penny,sorry. i was waiting for the bazinga.
23186,Penny,"well, then why are you doing it?"
22498,Penny,"i’m sorry. look, do you have a second."
25524,Penny,"oh, no, amy, i haven’t done anything."
22814,Penny,"leonard, remember when i said it was on? well, now it’s junior rodeo on."
22743,Penny,"sheldon, honey, i’ve told you, it’s a small apartment, you only have to knock one time."
25967,Penny,"if it makes you uncomfortable, i’ll switch partners, even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and i’ll probably end up failing the class."
25587,Penny,"you are welcome. yeah, i’m gonna have to move."
26542,Penny,ah.
29317,Penny,we thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.
28114,Penny,i think she means not a weirdo.
25265,Penny,"oh, it’s not a date, leonard. it’s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night."
27497,Penny,"hey, you know, raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. him and his mom have a type. you, you got to laugh at that, right? no? all right."
22751,Penny,"oh, gee, okay."
28221,Penny,all right. let’s just finish cooking.
27920,Penny,all right.
23174,Penny,it’s exactly the same…
26912,Penny,i don’t understand.
25323,Penny,"amy, little vixen. just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester."
28320,Penny,"if we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked."
24930,Penny,"okay, be nice."
22328,Penny,"so, you’ve got a bit of competition, i really don’t see what the big deal is. "
29199,Penny,"hey, i hope you don’t mind, i used a little of your eye cream last night."
27759,Penny,"oh, it’s cool, i’ve never been on a podcast before."
24597,Penny,"yeah. that’s why i’m going to skip over it. are you saying that amy is, oh, what’s the"
22082,Penny,"anything you want, okay? any costume you want. bye. "
22182,Penny,a… are you talking to me?
28789,Penny,"you know, so does leonard. can’t i just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? hey-hey-hey."
25075,Penny,thanks.
27269,Penny,"are you sure, because it doesn’t seem fine?"
22965,Penny,"yeah, and i checked. not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one."
23702,Penny,what do you mean?
24841,Penny,"oh, sweetie, it’s okay. i don’t want tea."
23065,Penny,"you’re damn right it’s okay. i’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and i wanted something different. so sue me."
24144,Penny,"no, no, that’s okay. just let me talk to him, and i’ll get back to you."
26635,Penny,but it didn’t seem real.
22643,Penny,"no, fritz, i need you on my flank. no, i don’t know german. flankenzie, flankenzie!"
23387,Penny,"alright, sheldon, let’s just calm down and we’ll call the building manager, he’ll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you’re waiting."
21902,Penny,really? would it be totally weird if i used it?
21933,Penny,"yeah, i probably won’t, but… hey sheldon."
27502,Penny,of course it is.
25069,Penny,sounds great.
25101,Penny,shh! here comes my joke.
27009,Penny,"sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?"
25797,Penny,"oh, disgusting."
24183,Penny,"you’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?"
28363,Penny,"yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over."
28153,Penny,i’m sorry. i’m not here.
22850,Penny,"okay, feeling the awkward now."
29067,Penny,yes.
26430,Penny,"oh. okay. well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a promise i won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana."
24532,Penny,"and that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call."
28661,Penny,"all right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone."
24163,Penny,"oh, i’m sorry."
23121,Penny,your mom still here?
23600,Penny,"the heart wants what the heart wants, leonard."

26449,Penny,"oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?"
25096,Penny,"anyways, i wanted you guys all to know that i’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion i have to stop kidding myself. i suck at acting. it’s time for me to move back to nebraska."
29101,Penny,"yeah, see, what’s happening here signals brain damage. my god, how long does this thing spin for?"

26161,Penny,"oh, i can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with."
25661,Penny,well…
23599,Penny,then we found out we both wanted ernie. we didn’t speak again until middle school.
26916,Penny,sheldon didn’t heckle him?
23127,Penny,"she was right, you know. the locus of my identity is totally exterior to me."
22412,Penny,that’s the saddest thing i’ve ever heard. 
24573,Penny,"oh, my god. what personal habits?"
27637,Penny,the answer’s in this puzzle box. let’s see if you can open it.
25660,Penny,"i don’t understand, why doesn’t howard just introduce you to the guy?"
24122,Penny,"no, no, it’s okay. i mean, let’s face it, you guys would get creamed without me."

24495,Penny,"okay, sheldon. what can i get you?"
23112,Penny,"oh, um, okay, like, five or six. five."
26006,Penny,you’re so butch.

25050,Penny,"okay, explain something to me. you watch leonard put up with that guy for years and years. what has to break inside your brain for you to think, oh, krishna, i’ve got to get me some of that?"

25097,Penny,yeah.
23722,Penny,what?
25003,Penny,"hey, do me a favour and take table seven."

24478,Penny,"yeah, i said i’d think about it."
27340,Penny,"well, it’s not that sweet, i paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage."
28736,Penny,"well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us."
28215,Penny,"hang on. wait, wait. why don’t i like the lingerie you got me?"
23728,Penny,"no, no, no, i can’t wait that long, you got to help me, please."

29341,Penny,"don’t look at me like that, i tried."
23875,Penny,eight years?
22227,Penny,"oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn’t.  yup, tip your waitresses, i’m here all week. "
23782,Penny,"my point is, i do not judge a book by its cover. i am interested in the person underneath."
27600,Penny,hey.
29031,Penny,"all right, we’re heading out."
26174,Penny,"as long as things keep going great between us, you’ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually i’m gonna end up saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out."
29427,Penny,sheldon help!
27221,Penny,i know. watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.
21898,Penny,"oh god, you know, four years i lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as high school. "
29480,Penny,"no, it’s because they’re in space. he’s really just touching the strap."
22673,Penny,"come on, this is huge, raj is going to be in people magazine. and he didn’t even have to knock up one of the spears sisters."
27440,Penny,we had a really nice swim.
24433,Penny,"really, you want me to sing soft kitty to a computer monitor?"
27176,Penny,"oh, i really appreciate this. i just hope i’m not in over my head."
28283,Penny,"hey, how’d it go?"
24101,Penny,fine. why don’t you pick out what you like.
28325,Penny,"ah, yeah, grandma by calvin klein. you know, the last time i got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me i parked like a blind person."
22300,Penny,"hey, where are you? "
25982,Penny,damn.
24801,Penny,"sheldon, it’s saturday night, you’ll be doing laundry."
29014,Penny,you did not just quote an nsync song.
21947,Penny,do you understand how creepy this is.
28347,Penny,"now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?"
23983,Penny,my rabe-what-ly?
26057,Penny,"damn, you’ve got more makeup than i do. you’ve got better makeup than i do. yeah, i’m borrowing this."

26489,Penny,what are you talking about?
25867,Penny,anybody home?
27268,Penny,"okay, i’m sorry. did we get off on the wrong foot? because since the other night, i kind of feel like you might have a problem with me."
26005,Penny,"okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs."
26562,Penny,"oh, i am. maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see why."
27151,Penny,what?
27252,Penny,hi.
28666,Penny,aw.
27438,Penny,"yeah, back off, he’s all mine."
24295,Penny,"zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!"

22790,Penny,"leonard, don’t you get it? if you guys keep going along with his insanity, you’re just encouraging him."
23044,Penny,"well, yeah, but…"
23850,Penny,i just love decorating the christmas tree. it makes me feel like a little girl again.
25168,Penny,you’re engaged to my friend.

23577,Penny,"yeah, maybe."
27770,Penny,aw.
22098,Penny,"i don’t care, i’m finishing it, put him down. "
22338,Penny,"oh, thanks raj, it’s vanilla oil."
22786,Penny,"yeah, no, there’s a new policy. no shoes, no shirt, no sheldon."
28444,Penny,"wait, wait, wait. what are these changes on page six?"
22073,Penny,yeah.
25886,Penny,whoa! that’s heavy.
27553,Penny,let’s just talk about our periods.
23647,Penny,"all right, five. one, two, three, four, five. oh, wow, look at that, my department of defence research grant is renewed."
23636,Penny,"here, have some pizza, sweetie."
25482,Penny,"all right. terrific. well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. we wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy."
29313,Penny,i don’t know; we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing.
24975,Penny,"yeah, you’re a scientist, where is the curiosity?"
28096,Penny,"okay, you don’t know what’s gonna happen."
25048,Penny,monkeys.
28516,Penny,"okay, really? so you’d be fine if i went back to acting and waiting tables again?"
28600,Penny,"what i was seeking was some sort of friendship. but at this point, i’ll take you not insulting me to my face."
24330,Penny,"okay, well, what do you communicate about?"
25284,Penny,i just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.
26977,Penny,"yeah, beam me up. i love it."
26324,Penny,"wow, hawking. good for you."
28027,Penny,hey.
27628,Penny,"oh, hey. did you see that? i, i figured out how to open the door all by myself. maybe i’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate."
28848,Penny,"yeah, he really is."
29035,Penny,"leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the rose parade."
24039,Penny,"what do you think? for doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. he has to stay in there until he apologizes."
27793,Penny,"okay, look, here’s the thing. i like pharmaceutical sales, it’s going great, but i have an audition for a movie, and if i get it, it could screw everything up."
28563,Penny,"uh, i don’t know."
24792,Penny,"okay, okay, let’s try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little."
27121,Penny,you know what? forget it. i never should’ve brought it up.
22701,Penny,what?
23505,Penny,"ugh, i am so embarrassed!"
21957,Penny,hi.
27460,Penny,i’ll be right there. bernadette’s just parking the car.
25385,Penny,"fine, go ahead."
24329,Penny,"oh, my god! sheldon and amy."
29414,Penny,"here you go, leonard. is this going to be big enough?"
28637,Penny,"oh, so follow him."
23903,Penny,"she’s not one of those phonies, okay. she wrote a book and has her own web site."
27534,Penny,"uh, bernadette’s nickname for you is the virgin piña colada."
22369,Penny,"pathetic. all of you, completely pathetic.  "
28384,Penny,"and whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with cheerios all over the floor."
27377,Penny,really? why?
28121,Penny,"well, so how does it work?"
26268,Penny,"oh, come on, don’t be like that."
29027,Penny,fine. lately i kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted.
26372,Penny,good night.
22086,Penny,"probably, but in their own homes. "
22620,Penny,"oh, i see?"
23931,Penny,"wait, wait, what’s 0400?"
23687,Penny,"i’m coming. goodbye, sheldon. what do you mean, transgressions i’ve committed?"
25740,Penny,"ah, thank you!"
28873,Penny,"oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? wow."
23316,Penny,"no, no occasion, just felt like getting some chinese chow for my peeps."
29159,Penny,"hey, pal, you want to live here or not?"
25333,Penny,mm.
28778,Penny,she’s right. that’s reasonable.
29413,Penny,"here you go. fresh from the cleaners, good as new."
24566,Penny,shut up. you know what i’ve been doing for the last hour?
23761,Penny,change migraine to yes.
29227,Penny,"oh, that, that’s so cool. how do you, how do you turn that thing off?"
29400,Penny,"hey, guys, i need to use your tv."
25616,Penny,there’s absolutely no difference.
25348,Penny,"oh, that’s awful."
22177,Penny,so coke.
22305,Penny,"oh, it’s okay, i didn’t really need to work today, it’s not like i have rent or car payments or anything."
25934,Penny,i’ve seen her burp you.
26851,Penny,"yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long."
29139,Penny,"okay, good, ’cause that’s what i want, too."
25294,Penny,what’s up?
27481,Penny,because this company needs you.
22784,Penny,"oh, i didn’t tell you? you’re banished from the cheesecake factory."
29163,Penny,"well, it’s like that science thing. for every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction."
28584,Penny,"yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and i’d like for us to have a good relationship."
29405,Penny,"leonard, congratulations."
23192,Penny,"hey, leonard. what’s going on with dr. wackadoodle?"
29002,Penny,there’s a tree on you.
26123,Penny,it’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.
26858,Penny,yeah. i’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. we love animals.
29173,Penny,"yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special."
22081,Penny,of course.
25115,Penny,"why don’t you give it a try, sheldon?"
25694,Penny,"for the record, not your worst opening line."
27019,Penny,"come on, anything can happen. we can push him down the stairs."
25043,Penny,"what do you mean, new roommate? what happened to leonard?"
25741,Penny,"oh, come on. i just told you i had a hard day."
22008,Penny,how come you didn’t go into work today.
24102,Penny,"no, you’re wrong."
26035,Penny,"oh, and who’s that?"
23469,Penny,hi! 
24260,Penny,"apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy."
24214,Penny,what’s the problem with goofy?
23593,Penny,"really? oh, great. i mean, aw. okay, i gotta go."
26618,Penny,smile.

28890,Penny,"you’re dating somebody, who is it?"
23255,Penny,"wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? since when do we offer a one-day rush?"
25715,Penny,yep.
22464,Penny,go away!
22215,Penny,"sweetie, put the pants on."
24428,Penny,because you’re not here.
29252,Penny,what’s the matter?
26722,Penny,"oh, that’s so sweet of you, but i was gonna steal food from here. you know, my treat."
23559,Penny,of course.
26821,Penny,"okay, so i’m an adult, and the other day i saw an old man slip and fall down, and i laughed. i mean, i laughed hard. like, like, out loud. if he was conscious, he would’ve heard me."
25903,Penny,"okay, listen, there’s something i need to tell you. i’ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. so a couple months ago, i started taking a history class at the community college."
27773,Penny,"well, maybe i can do both."
23978,Penny,we’re going to disneyland and ride the matterhorn?
22771,Penny,a sports metaphor?
25687,Penny,"yeah, sure, i guess."
26908,Penny,"yeah. why wouldn’t i want to get my old job back? it’ll be fun to see everyone. i haven’t talked to them since i said i quit, see you at the oscars, bitches. come on, let’s just get this over with."
25447,Penny,"wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?"
25717,Penny,no!
23282,Penny,how else was i supposed to say it?
24151,Penny,"so, we’re good?"
22042,Penny,because you are not at big boy!
24092,Penny,"yes, but you’re not smarter than all of us put together."
23679,Penny,great.
23658,Penny,you know what? don’t talk to me like i’m an idiot.
25753,Penny,"one inappropriate, yet i wish i thought of that gravy boat."

27482,Penny,see? you don’t have to be mean to get what you want.
25555,Penny,"yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…"
22063,Penny,"just pretty good, i’d think you were doing very good. "
29310,Penny,"not only did they eat together, leonard said he made her laugh."
26034,Penny,"hmm. well, i’m glad you’re having such a great day."
22208,Penny,"seriously, don’t even give it to charity, you won’t be helping anyone. what’s this."

26297,Penny,"shut up. you can do that? i mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?"
27405,Penny,"aw, that’s sad."

23111,Penny,"right, okay. what was he like when he was young?"
22263,Penny,"you know, i got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that’s not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when… when he has a symposium to go to. "
22009,Penny,"so you got canned, huh?"
26420,Penny,"yeah, i didn’t stay for the detention, i’m not gonna read the report card."

24166,Penny,no!
28023,Penny,that’s so great.
28085,Penny,"well, honey, you don’t live with sheldon any more. you can have anything you want."

26257,Penny,"well, hang on. maybe the chinese haven’t finished watching it yet."
26450,Penny,"he’s still mad at leonard, huh?"
25054,Penny,i screwed up. leonard’s a great guy. never should have broken up with him.
23540,Penny,"oh, you’re my little homunculus."
23364,Penny,"uh, stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening tonight."
22615,Penny,sheldor?
24547,Penny,"well, you’re the first guy he’s ever really approved of, you know? you’re a scientist who went to college and you don’t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby."
26607,Penny,"well, i also said i was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. you know, i may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. now, you want to hear the specials?"
27989,Penny,"okay, look, it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend."
29258,Penny,"uh, it’s okay, i’m still in pharmaceutical sales."
27228,Penny,"yeah, and actually, i drink sauvignon blanc."
27797,Penny,"if i was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should i get on?"
28035,Penny,your glasses?
27610,Penny,no.

22559,Penny,"sheldon, i’m working."
22935,Penny,"uh, sweetie, sweetie, dave was talking. you know, i love science."
23124,Penny,"geez, what a fun couple."
23705,Penny,"come on, sheldon, let’s go home. look, we’re done fighting."
28099,Penny,"well, it’s not forever. it’s just for a while. if you want, we can think of him like he’s our dog."
27423,Penny,"oh, it’s beautiful."
28176,Penny,"all right, where is tall british dave taking you?"
22253,Penny,"well, the girl they picked to play mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her. "
26182,Penny,"yeah, i can’t tell you how many times i’ve been at a party where everyone’s talking about flags and i just couldn’t join in."
23758,Penny,no.
25110,Penny,"sheldon, take it easy."
23581,Penny,"oh, kill me."
26588,Penny,"you’ve had this dart board since i’ve known you, but i’ve never seen you play."
29286,Penny,"and for the world’s tallest second grader, apple juice."
27302,Penny,bye.
25762,Penny,no. maybe. i don’t know.

23765,Penny,"hey, sheldon, sheldon, look, i am scared and in a lot of pain. could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, i don’t know, comforting?"
22826,Penny,"howard, didn’t you say you worked on the mars rover?"
27774,Penny,i don’t think i asked you.
23632,Penny,"oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. they just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen."
27107,Penny,it was over a bowling alley.
26031,Penny,any particular reason why?
24305,Penny,"oh, god."
22975,Penny,how is it supposed to be a dance if i’m the only girl?
28828,Penny,really? i feel like i’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.
22187,Penny,"okay, if you’re going to drink on this date just promise me you won’t overdo it. "
23954,Penny,"oh, damn."
25941,Penny,it’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
27202,Penny,"uh, no. actually, i didn’t invite her."
26587,Penny,"hey, can i ask you a question?"
22015,Penny,120?
29114,Penny,"well, sometimes you can get free food and wi-fi from the neighbours. just know you might have to marry one of ’em."
27454,Penny,"who are you kidding? you were so panicked leonard was gonna die, you’ll never leave him."
22477,Penny,"really, do you think i overreacted?"
24446,Penny,"kinda, sorta had to?"
22173,Penny,"okay, raj, what’ll it be?  "
27642,Penny,"honey, neither of us comes off good in that story."
28425,Penny,"oh, sure. let me see it."

22381,Penny,"yeah, i just have to change."
28228,Penny,i am not putting that on the internet. i don’t want people to see this. i don’t want to see it.
23828,Penny,"uh, we know that… newton was a really smart cookie. oh! is that where fig newtons come from?"
25819,Penny,"fine, it bothers me a little. no. you know what? this is stupid. it doesn’t bother me. okay, it bothers me. but only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. leonard is not that funny."
23343,Penny,"you got me. while you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?"
25757,Penny,he’s a sweetie.
23968,Penny,"no, wait, wait, no, wait. wh.. what are you doing here?"
25410,Penny,"i know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. and what if something goes wrong? then what?"

27010,Penny,"leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?"
26547,Penny,"okay, just you wait and see. i’m gonna romance your freakin’ ass off."
27731,Penny,and that’s why you get an ipad helicopter.

29294,Penny,"oh, hey, what’s going on?"
24927,Penny,"you know, for the first couple of months, whenever i would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends."
22171,Penny,"so leonard, how about it?"
23380,Penny,"what’s wrong, superman? locked out of your big ice thingy?"
23974,Penny,"sheldon, where are you going? aren’t you going to clean this up?"

23726,Penny,"well, i can’t drive!"
25234,Penny,thank you. where’s sheldon?
22277,Penny,"oh, it was okay i guess, wasn’t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it. "

26798,Penny,"yeah, well, maybe we do."
26245,Penny,"she’d be proud, huh?"
28601,Penny,you’ve been doing it all day. do you even know what an insult is?
22609,Penny,"why? i’ll tell you why. because today i had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, i waited an hour for my turn, and before i could even start they told me i looked too midwest for the part. too midwest? what the hell does that even mean?"
26781,Penny,hi. what’s up?
27981,Penny,"you know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university."
21910,Penny,it’s okay if you say no.
24591,Penny,"oh, we know what’s causing that, don’t we?"
24062,Penny,"okay, sweetie, i don’t know if we’re gonna have cookies, or he’s just gonna say hi, or really what’s gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we’ll…"

29397,Penny,"sheldon, what is it?"
25750,Penny,that’s enough.

21944,Penny,what’s he talking about?
25522,Penny,"all right, howard wolowitz, listen up. you sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. if you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. and you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood."
22188,Penny,"yeah, that. uh, why don’t you bring her to my restaurant when i’m tending the bar so i can keep an eye on you?"

22535,Penny,"oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little."
26734,Penny,i think you meant that you don’t believe in me.
24262,Penny,"oh, i do not believe that."
25224,Penny,so sleep with the new girl and lie to priya.
25635,Penny,"uh, from stuart at the comic-book store."
24754,Penny,probably. i’m just enjoying the foreplay. does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
22948,Penny,why are you yelling at me?
26660,Penny,"how can you not be happy? you’re tall, thin and famous. oh, my god, i’m jealous of sheldon."
22112,Penny,i should probably go.

26323,Penny,i thought i said that to you.
26281,Penny,"oh, obviously it’s gonna happen. yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. anyway, what i meant was, i shouldn’t wait, you know? i’ve got you, i’ve got sheldon, all these wonderful friends. my life is exciting right now."
23363,Penny,"all right. so, um, just give me a call."
24913,Penny,are you really that kind of guy?

28242,Penny,problem solved.
22553,Penny,"okay, look, if leonard finds out that i lied, i will absolutely die of embarrassment. "
26945,Penny,"yeah, me, too."
24013,Penny,happy valentine’s day.

28253,Penny,"aw, that’s nice. put that on her cake."
22107,Penny,"you really think so, don’t you? "
25744,Penny,thank you. 
23478,Penny,"wait, wait. aren’t you going to go talk to him?"
21946,Penny,give me back my key.
22352,Penny,"okay. marsha, jan and cindy were the three daughters of what tv family?  the brady bunch. okay, sammy hagar replaced david lee roth as the lead singer in what group?"
27869,Penny,mmm. so what do you need help with?
26852,Penny,i think there’s something going on between the two of them.
22710,Penny,"sheldon, you know  that we care about you."
28047,Penny,there you go. you’re all done.
29306,Penny,a lot of lectures?
27618,Penny,how?
25980,Penny,"okay, maybe we should change the subject. um, amy, how are your lady parts? still chilly down there?"
25170,Penny,hi.
28871,Penny,"uh, she’s enjoyed living with you. it’s called being in love."
29287,Penny,"oh, i’m sorry to hear that."
24580,Penny,"daddy, he had nothing to do…"
28094,Penny,they’re not saying that.
21974,Penny,"you know, sheldon, howard, raj, who all’s coming?"
26574,Penny,"yeah, but only because i was dating a second grader."
22787,Penny,hi.
26405,Penny,"okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. when i first moved out to l.a., i did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. ugh! after i did it, i felt so ashamed. thankfully, that thing never came out."
27751,Penny,"yeah, it’s also like when the mountain fought the red viper in game of thrones."
28372,Penny,cleaning up is not young and fun.
24718,Penny,"hey, can i stay here tonight?"
21872,Penny,great. 
28053,Penny,"fine. i’m calling home, but when i’m done, you’re calling your mother."
23809,Penny,"yeah, okay, cool. i don’t need the pbs special, i just want to know enough so i can talk to leonard about his job. you know, like bernadette does."
24365,Penny,"guys, how ’bout some music?"
23310,Penny,how would i know? i’m not even sure i get it.
21997,Penny,are you sure you don’t want to go to the emergency room?
25415,Penny,"okay, uh, let’s see. i’m from nebraska, and ever since i was a little girl, i dreamed of moving to l.a. and becoming a movie star. anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, i’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of anne frank above a bowling alley. so, you know, dreams do come true. your turn."
26082,Penny,"well, which is it?"
25464,Penny,"you know, just for fun, let’s say i’m not."
22693,Penny,"yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing, okay?"
23847,Penny,"actually, that’s not true, leonard. in fact, recently i’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the netherlands. their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the aharonov-bohm quantum-interference effect. that’s it. that’s all i know. oh, wait! fig newtons were named after a town in massachusetts, not the scientist."
22831,Penny,new shirts?
29182,Penny,we’re so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. we really weren’t fighting about you.
23500,Penny,i don’t know.
29241,Penny,"look, sweetie, relationships aren’t about money, okay? it’s about respect and having things in common and… yes, sheldon?"
25605,Penny,mm.
27557,Penny,date night.
27678,Penny,and begin. this is kind of creepy.
25953,Penny,that sounds like fun.
27691,Penny,it really has.
28585,Penny,okay.
25310,Penny,did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
23653,Penny,"yeah, my friend from omaha, plays the guitar. anyway, he’s coming to l.a. looking for some session work, so i told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks."
23810,Penny,‘cause i want to surprise him.
24044,Penny,"okay, maybe you’ll have another chance to have…"
26998,Penny,doesn’t it?
27311,Penny,no.
25988,Penny,get away from me or i swear to god i will rip out what’s left of your pubes!
22516,Penny,"sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what i’m talking about. "
24370,Penny,i don’t know. i was just trying something.
25454,Penny,"yeah, kind of, yeah."
26262,Penny,it’s six thirty in the morning.
28383,Penny,"yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes."
22877,Penny,"hi! stephanie, right?"
27397,Penny,yeah.
22532,Penny,got it. 
23189,Penny,your dresser? who is this?
25320,Penny,"okay, don’t judge me. so, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?"
29264,Penny,"you work with sheldon, you tell me."
25979,Penny,i’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at comic-con?
24996,Penny,"um, okay. tell bernadette to tell priya that i’m on my way to prague to shoot a movie with angelina jolie."
27808,Penny,yeah. i started that rumour.
24905,Penny,what?
22650,Penny,got it.
23320,Penny,yes.
22130,Penny,"gosh, he’s kind of a sore loser, isn’t he?"
22461,Penny,i’m so sorry you didn’t get your party.
27036,Penny,how is that not good?
26517,Penny,"‘cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go."
26880,Penny,"okay, i have not tried to change leonard. that’s just what happens in relationships. look how much amy’s changed you."
24642,Penny,"okay, stop, stop!"
26838,Penny,"oh, that’s true. "
26037,Penny,because i know she hit on you and i know you liked it.
22606,Penny,"dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit."
26964,Penny,"okay, look, here, page 58. i oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini."
26401,Penny,how about we just talk?
27879,Penny,still haven’t heard from her?
24475,Penny,really? and that didn’t make her feel better?
24799,Penny,"yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;  you’ll be fine."
24202,Penny,"yeah, i guess you’re right."
27266,Penny,"so, femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure."
24607,Penny,"okay, we should, we should go."
23891,Penny,you’re in trouble.
24355,Penny,"yeah. well, my question is, and i’m pretty sure i know the answer, is this your first date?"
23272,Penny,really?
23253,Penny,"wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with bluetooth?"
24127,Penny,yes. i love chilli cheese fries.
24924,Penny,so what’s the thanks i get for turning leonard into quality boyfriend material? i have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.
27388,Penny,"so, you just left them alone playing games in your house?"
24367,Penny,"well, why don’t you tell her?"
27558,Penny,okay.
22226,Penny,get anything good? 
28457,Penny,"i mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? i moved here from nebraska to be an actress, and now i’m sitting in an engineering lab at caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system."
25337,Penny,"oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy."
22599,Penny,are you going to let me talk?
23486,Penny,"look, sheldon, i just don’t think that the guys and leonard really meant to hurt you. you know? they just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. okay, you know what it’s like? remember that scene in the new star trek movie when kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true, like saying spock didn’t care his mom died?"
25525,Penny,okay. 
25828,Penny,you’re unbelievable.
27801,Penny,i’m sorry. what was i thinking?
22402,Penny,"i did your horoscope, remember, i was going to do everybody’s until sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants."
28918,Penny,i can’t believe you punched bert.
28260,Penny,"okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. let’s, let’s, let’s just recap our options. all right, we’ve got harp thing, sheep thing."
26205,Penny,i’m in.
25854,Penny,"all right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins."
25324,Penny,"oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a sheldon. so do you like stuart?"
22192,Penny,i know the reason. 
24408,Penny,don’t have one.
28551,Penny,the little choo-choo for toddlers?
24644,Penny,bored.
23684,Penny,"well, i’m sorry, sheldon, but this really isn’t about you."
28971,Penny,"hey, can you help me put some of the food out?"
24527,Penny,"oh, gosh, amy. i don’t know if i would call this an actual slumber party."
24713,Penny,"again, i’ve never given it much thought."
26483,Penny,let’s go.
22014,Penny,"oh, sure i am."
24812,Penny,"again, read the book we gave you."
24401,Penny,"okay, here’s my question. didn’t you already do that?"
23263,Penny,"honey, do you want some coffee?"
24872,Penny,"let me see that. oh, screw it. i can deal with a little self-loathing. let’s go find me a heinie to bite."
25774,Penny,of course not.
25809,Penny,"no, you do not."
24346,Penny,leonard said cockamamie?
28860,Penny,mm. so why don’t they just get more drywall?
25738,Penny,this is awesome. i love it!
28989,Penny,"actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight."
28576,Penny,yes.
26080,Penny,"that makes even less sense, i mean…"
24923,Penny,"i am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. and he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, i had to carry him to the water."
27281,Penny,"i don’t know what emily’s so upset about anyway. even if i had slept with him, so what? everyone has a past."
24352,Penny,you’re welcome.
29021,Penny,"oh, it was fine."
24064,Penny,"hi. i’m penny. this is my friend, sheldon."
24157,Penny,"hey, thanks."
26317,Penny,pretend he’s that tsa agent. come on.
28119,Penny,"oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with stuart."

29344,Penny,son of a bitch!
24143,Penny,"oh, honey, i don’t know. things are a little weird with leonard right now."
26820,Penny,"let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘cause i am not sure i do."
24225,Penny,i think we can do it.
22810,Penny,get them down.
28735,Penny,"oh, so nothing. great. do they know why the pipe burst?"

29259,Penny,"yeah, lying isn’t my favourite part of the job. actually, i’m not crazy about a lot of it."
27701,Penny,"well, why?"
24631,Penny,"i’m not going to that party, leonard."
26510,Penny,"well, why were you so angry?"
27356,Penny,you know what? i’m sorry. it’s stupid to fight over money.

29148,Penny,"wait, you don’t want me to go?"
27357,Penny,"ugh, you’re right, who cares? mm. get that money out of my back pocket or i will break your fingers."
29411,Penny,"i mean, my mom could’ve just said, “bob, get over it, she’s a girl, move on.” but she didn’t. not one word."
28853,Penny,"yeah, that’s gonna cost you later."
25538,Penny,bye.
22306,Penny,"okay, well, you feel better."
23676,Penny,yes.
24925,Penny,want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?
24185,Penny,i’ll pretend i didn’t hear it.
27589,Penny,"“time travel? i don’t understand,” said amelia. cooper stared at her. ‘which word don’t you understand, time or travel?”"
24022,Penny,"oh. so, is this bruce lee’s nerdy brother, stan?"
23309,Penny,"uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, i read the best science joke on the internet. alicia, you won’t get it, but it’s right up their alley. anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. this goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he’s doing. the man says, “well, i’m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” the owner then says, “well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don’t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?” and the physicist says, “yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”"
24737,Penny,good for you.
28679,Penny,how did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?
28832,Penny,"well, thanks."
26126,Penny,"that is the worst, isn’t it?"
28604,Penny,it was spur of the moment.
27415,Penny,"okay, what’s up?"
26159,Penny,"what?  oh, you got to be kidding me."
23542,Penny,"yes, well, i want a boyfriend whose roommate isn’t a giant pain in the ass."
22922,Penny,uh-huh.
25561,Penny,"yeah, okay. that’s, uh, that’s good."
23185,Penny,"oh, cool."
22209,Penny,uh-huh. 
29429,Penny,hi. sorry i’m late.
24850,Penny,"yeah, it’s a great time to be alive, isn’t it?"
27474,Penny,"no, come on. you are not going anywhere, all right? i am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together."
27841,Penny,"oh. hello. i, i didn’t know he was gonna point it at me, so, don’t do drugs and stay in school."
22331,Penny,what?
29515,Penny,do you really think that’s funny?
25606,Penny,"sure, i get that. i mean, he’s your first boyfriend and all."
28724,Penny,"what? you tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?"
26294,Penny,"okay, i didn’t know."
22303,Penny,"he won’t leave, he says he’s afraid he’ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs."
28433,Penny,"okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you?"
26883,Penny,or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.
28841,Penny,here you go. 
25665,Penny,"what do you want me to tell you, sheldon?"
24784,Penny,it’s only logical.
27511,Penny,thank you.
22522,Penny,hi.
25922,Penny,"yeah, well, next time don’t. oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not the shoemaker"
27839,Penny,"yeah. you’re gonna be on skype, they’re not gonna see your legs."
28338,Penny,say yes.
23340,Penny,thank you.
22911,Penny,"come on, leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to."
28761,Penny,"inevitable, you say?"
24798,Penny,there you go.
22558,Penny,"also today we have a fresh caught alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. our soup of the day…"
23935,Penny,"no, thanks."
24184,Penny,mmm. how’s leonard doing?
26800,Penny,"look, i know you think i’m being reckless, and you might be right, but i need to take this shot."
22706,Penny,no.
27291,Penny,"oh. well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?"
27744,Penny,"you know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than sheldon."
26391,Penny,no. yeah. but you know what the second-worst part is? he does not miss me at all.
23779,Penny,are you high?
23798,Penny,"oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. in the summer, it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. it faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted."
28500,Penny,"sheldon, what did you do?"
27434,Penny,want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?
22392,Penny,of course.
28290,Penny,mm-hmm?
22452,Penny,"you have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell “surprise!” "
26569,Penny,"no, it’s not. i mean, what’s thoughtful is everything you do. here, you know what? look at this. look, here’s the, the plane ticket you bought me when i was too poor to go home for the holidays. and the rose you left on my windshield just because. here’s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time i slept with you. all 11 pages of it."
29265,Penny,"okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with zack?"
24840,Penny,not really.
23986,Penny,"okay, i know i shouldn’t ask, but what is…?"
23335,Penny,"yeah, you know, like in star trek, when you’re in battle and you raise the shields? where the hell did that come from? anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don’t take advantage of them."
27239,Penny,i said i don’t want you to. i’m getting another drink.
26695,Penny,"hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn’t pee himself."
22545,Penny,no.
27985,Penny,that’s ridiculous.
22463,Penny,"oh, i’ll tell you what’s going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. "
25441,Penny,so we don’t tell people we’re back together?
22581,Penny,"well, they have a lot in common. i mean they’re both scientists."
25602,Penny,"well, i know he didn’t cheat on you, so what happened?"
28770,Penny,i feel like i should say damn.
24533,Penny,"okay, it’s your game. you go first."
28698,Penny,something happen at the meeting?
25453,Penny,the hell do you think you’re going?
26841,Penny,"oh, my god."
26451,Penny,"i don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good."
23889,Penny,leonard?
26657,Penny,"oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing in my face."
28620,Penny,"well, then it’s settled. yay. so funny. i never thought my second marriage would be to you."
26604,Penny,"yeah, i get that. i’ll go get you your water. when you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him."
28471,Penny,"yeah, it’s fine."
26969,Penny,huh?
27430,Penny,"well, you wouldn’t have asked me either."
25856,Penny,it’s not getting any better.  ugh. it’s leonard. he wants to go costume shopping later.
24085,Penny,"ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym."
24239,Penny,hello.
22642,Penny,"really? boy, you’d think you could trust a horde of hungarian barbarians."
22859,Penny,what?
26623,Penny,"look, i’m telling you i’ve done it, okay? i clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side."
22870,Penny,no.
26599,Penny,"yeah, well, you’re short."
27970,Penny,you’re right. just forget it.
27760,Penny,those are star trek people.
29325,Penny,"so, sheldon, have you talked to amy?"
25546,Penny,i came to say i’m sorry.
27747,Penny,"sure. oh, we had one of these growing up. i used to play all the time."
27586,Penny,you know i’m gonna read it either way.
28896,Penny,how come you never eat broccoli?
28588,Penny,"wow. didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. uh, you know what, enough about leonard. let’s talk about you. what would you like to do while you’re here?"
29437,Penny,shamy. i am so digging the shamy.
25027,Penny,"yeah, tell me about it."
24119,Penny,"okay, good night, sweetie."
27647,Penny,i’m not gonna fall in love with sheldon.
26989,Penny,"no. i’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and i know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want."
23667,Penny,"e-e-e-e-eh! wrong answer, but thank you for playing."
25117,Penny,"what’s up, buttercup?"
24835,Penny,are leonard and priya here?
24059,Penny,can i bring leonard?
28880,Penny,thank you.
27594,Penny,"what? no, i really want to know what happens, and bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens."
28949,Penny,"well while we’re all awake, why don’t we go to a diner or something?"
25123,Penny,you’re kidding.
23842,Penny,"okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what leonard does?"
24033,Penny,what is this?
22759,Penny,"oh. that’s anais, none of the other girls in the house like her."
25127,Penny,really?
23674,Penny,i’m busy.
26479,Penny,wow. i can drink a beer underwater.
21930,Penny,"oh. okay, great, i’m having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and i may not be here, so….  oh! hel…hello!"
25400,Penny,"uh, about two years ago."
23336,Penny,"come on, they’re doing everything for you, because you’re leading them on."
29268,Penny,"so he’s my ex-boyfriend, who cares? i can’t believe leonard would be so insecure."
27210,Penny,"uh, thanks, but i think i’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff bernadette gave me."
27016,Penny,are you kidding? that’s what you always do. think harder.
25515,Penny,"so you’re saying if i became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?"
25978,Penny,"hey, anybody want a drink?"
26412,Penny,"sheldon, you are right. i’m really sorry. i should’ve known better."
25844,Penny,"oh, come on, what is that?"
27758,Penny,it’s in your purse. play.

25908,Penny,"hey hey hey, this is my paper. and my perspective is that slavery is bad. oh, and my professor’s black, so i’m pretty sure that’s the right answer."
28643,Penny,"oh, thanks for asking until i did."

27907,Penny,"oh, thank you."
25017,Penny,"oh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs."
29445,Penny,you laughed.
26071,Penny,"well then, what do you recommend?"
23683,Penny,i am not going to apologize. i’ve done nothing wrong. he is completely overreacting.
28902,Penny,"oh, i heard him interviewed on the radio. you know, when they told him he won, he didn’t believe it, but then he did believe it. it was so funny."
24701,Penny,"uh, i don’t know. are you food?"
25975,Penny,"that’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to make me cry, and we both know if i start crying, you’re gonna start crying."

24895,Penny,okay.
26568,Penny,"oh, my god, i am the worst."
22981,Penny,"flirting? you think i’m flirting with you? i am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you’re just gonna grow old and die alone."
27583,Penny,why? is it about you and sheldon?
26090,Penny,"okay, hang on. if i go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did i pick up the girl?"

26762,Penny,i’m gonna go.
28061,Penny,"well, what is it?"

26833,Penny,happy valentine’s day.
22312,Penny,again?
28110,Penny,and sometimes we marry them anyway.
23278,Penny,"okay, it’s done. look, guys, for the future, i don’t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones."
29200,Penny,"don’t worry about it. hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?"
27384,Penny,"okay, he just showed up at my door. don’t you think that’s a little weird?"
23260,Penny,going online to buy shoes!
22713,Penny,what?

29228,Penny,"i don’t even run there, i drive."
29448,Penny,"yeah, i have a question. is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to los angeles tonight?"
26397,Penny,"oh, that’s really sweet."

29236,Penny,"you know, on our first date, leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel."
26366,Penny,you’re talking to me.
27483,Penny,"hey, how are things going with your parents?"
23225,Penny,"sheldon, hold on. could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?"
23220,Penny,"i don’t know, like, 50 cents. i’m not sure."
23130,Penny,"yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. your mother told me."
25280,Penny,no. no woman would.
24767,Penny,all right.
23961,Penny,what happened?
26370,Penny,"sweetie, did you have a bad dream?"
28138,Penny,does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
25547,Penny,"oh, amy, please."
25347,Penny,"hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose."
24432,Penny,what do you want me to do?
29245,Penny,"oh, zack. hey."
26341,Penny,"honey, this is a big deal for leonard, okay? he gets to work with stephen hawking. who, by the way, will not be on the boat. i checked it out."
22254,Penny,"it’s not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know. "
22394,Penny,missy?
22960,Penny,turn it over.
27111,Penny,"hmm. you think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny."
27115,Penny,i don’t know. we could get married.
27878,Penny,that carrot was delicious.
27859,Penny,"why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little chinese babies are."
27095,Penny,"life? what life? look at me, i’m a monster. and now i have blood on my hands, or paws. i don’t know."
28355,Penny,"i mean, we’re basically the same age."
28572,Penny,helium.
23633,Penny,"sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game."
23896,Penny,"i blame penny, too. bad penny."
26364,Penny,you will.
23579,Penny,"hey, i happen to love this movie."
27946,Penny,"thanks, but i don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs."
28657,Penny,"uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part."
26456,Penny,aw.
23376,Penny,"that’s superman’s big ice thing, right?"
26643,Penny,fine.
26730,Penny,"ugh, this is such a disaster. my parents had all my relatives over. they got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in mexico by now. so humiliating."
28074,Penny,what? what are you doing back?
28925,Penny,but you like it so much.
26647,Penny,"well, you’ll be happy to know i just spoke to zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. he’s on his way here now."
27131,Penny,you’re right! yay!
24634,Penny,i don’t know. i only started seeing zack again so i wouldn’t be alone on new year’s eve. how pathetic is that?
28943,Penny,"no, still hideous."
26642,Penny,i can’t believe i felt bad for opening this in the car.

29340,Penny,all right. what do you think is happening?
28939,Penny,what do you think? should we go to a hotel?
22523,Penny,come on in.
25705,Penny,"no, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?"
24539,Penny,"i don’t know. he got really serious, and i wasn’t ready for it."
22390,Penny,goodbye leonard! 
28892,Penny,"all right, fine, don’t tell us."
28400,Penny,"well, where is he?"
25799,Penny,sorry!
24224,Penny,he’s such an angel when he’s asleep.
27012,Penny,"hey, that’s good. why’d you guys stop doing that?"
22291,Penny,"oh, it’s okay, i understand."
27722,Penny,i’m sorry. what can i do?
26248,Penny,"oh, good, you heard me."
24594,Penny,so how’s amy?
25349,Penny,wow. you poor thing.
28779,Penny,"yeah. you tell him, babe."
22307,Penny,"um, home, to write some bad cheques."
28557,Penny,"hey, are you still hanging out with bernadette tonight?"
25664,Penny,"see, there it is, there’s that twinkle."
24753,Penny,i think it’s the only way to look at it.
28960,Penny,how many times do i have to say i’m sorry?
24725,Penny,the what?
28184,Penny,but you’re curious about aluminium cans? you’re a weird little guy.
28477,Penny,"you know, there’s a cabin in big bear that a doctor i work with keeps offering me."
23063,Penny,"here, leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars."
27966,Penny,nicely done.
23099,Penny,"nope. i just think he’s really changed. we’re having dinner tomorrow night, and i get to wear my new beret. bye, guys."
22137,Penny,"uh, the couch is good."
24593,Penny,that’s thinking ahead.
23306,Penny,that is so awesome.
24951,Penny,"okay, give. how do you know? did he tell you?"
24983,Penny,i’m fine.
28957,Penny,"maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away."
24523,Penny,"oh, thanks. i found this place in alhambra. it’s in a woman’s basement. i think it’s a front"
25253,Penny,sorry.
25898,Penny,"no, i’m not embarrassed. i just didn’t want anyone to know because i haven’t told leonard yet."
27888,Penny,yeah.
23047,Penny,are they working on that?
27987,Penny,right? i can’t believe amy actually went through with it.
28256,Penny,we’re sorry. what do you need?
25268,Penny,"so movies, yes or no?"
23527,Penny,"no, i mean, we can always go back to being friends."
27351,Penny,you two want to be alone?
22095,Penny,"of course not, no, he’s not, you’re not, right leonard? "
24286,Penny,"yeah, maybe."
27783,Penny,"no, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. i’m not overly conservative. i’m young, so my guy said i can afford to take some risks."
26817,Penny,i can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.
24785,Penny,all right.
22003,Penny,"okay, i was just checking."
24756,Penny,"saturday, nine a.m. bring cash."
26709,Penny,"what do you mean, not exactly?"
26886,Penny,"well, i’m glad you’re still together."
25288,Penny,i hope alex gets crabs: the movie.
21890,Penny,"um, me, okay, i’m sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know."
27359,Penny,"well, do you guys ever fight over money?"
28227,Penny,what are you doing?
22697,Penny,mm-hmm.
25882,Penny,sometimes i forget how smart you are.
25761,Penny,it means he is special and smart and nice and…
26537,Penny,"all right, don’t worry. i talked to leonard. he is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight."
26132,Penny,"well, i don’t know what else we can do but tell them the truth."
27892,Penny,really good.
28611,Penny,"uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but i think we got to a good place."
28417,Penny,"my point is, there was a time i never would’ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. so, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, i’m happy to do it with you."
23325,Penny,…chinese food right here.
23219,Penny,about twenty.
28327,Penny,"constance, are you sure i can’t pour you some wine?"
24740,Penny,"yeah, hi."
24508,Penny,what?
26445,Penny,"sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that. "
29446,Penny,"oh, good. hey."
29332,Penny,"pardon. i just need to., yeah."
26842,Penny,"no, cinnamon ate the chocolates. that’s really bad for dogs."
25751,Penny,raj.
27317,Penny,"yeah, it’s okay. go ahead."
25065,Penny,you know what? let’s get out of here.
23915,Penny,really?
25668,Penny,why should i worry?
26009,Penny,"oh, you poor thing. is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?"
25823,Penny,"oh, is that it?"
27572,Penny,it would be humiliating.
26814,Penny,"yes, like a museum, but anything else."
28402,Penny,"yeah, what is the problem? is it about getting older?"
23545,Penny,i know. what are the odds?
28656,Penny,"oh, i can’t wait for you to meet everyone. i told them all about you."
26233,Penny,sure.
22099,Penny,"leonard, are you okay."
22286,Penny,"boy, it’s good to be back. "
26743,Penny,you didn’t get your part cut.
25322,Penny,what’s wrong?
22571,Penny,bye guys.
23742,Penny,"you have your learner’s permit, right?"
23688,Penny,"like what? yeah, yeah, i see you, you’re making a little cheque sign in the air, i got it, just hold your horses. what does leonard complain about?"
29415,Penny,"oh, hey, guys."
29388,Penny,hi.
28534,Penny,"don’t worry, he’ll come around."
22957,Penny,merry christmas.
28554,Penny,what are you doing?
27032,Penny,"hey, i don’t understand why you’re not upset with amy."
27544,Penny,"the exercise, sheldon. shouldn’t you be getting ready for work?"
23907,Penny,"right, and if you can’t understand it, it’s not a fact."
25504,Penny,i think he misses his little buddy.
27056,Penny,"oh, i get it, like c3po. what happened to me?"
24472,Penny,"oh, you’re right. that is so embarrassing."
29046,Penny,i think this all looks good.
24744,Penny,"that bad, huh?"
23651,Penny,"my friend, justin."
25971,Penny,your picture’s on my refrigerator.
22133,Penny,"good night, leonard."
27419,Penny,"not always. unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always."
21887,Penny,what’s the difference?
26855,Penny,oh. okay. oh. oh. hey.
24723,Penny,we’re just gonna have to make the best of this.
25926,Penny,i don’t think he’ll be making that mistake again.
28233,Penny,public nudity?
23408,Penny,maybe that’s because your hole is still open.
27711,Penny,"okay, come on. we are not old boring people. we can do better than this."
23922,Penny,i’m not scared. i would’ve gone all nebraska on their asses.
29190,Penny,"yeah, yeah, bye, leonard."
27130,Penny,"oh, my god, yes."
28994,Penny,"ugh. it’s 70 degrees, you didn’t need mittens."
25890,Penny,there we go.
29050,Penny,i take it back. i believe it.
28266,Penny,"oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow."
29012,Penny,pink wine and pizza bagels? it’s like eighth grade all over again. i am so lucky to have you.
22820,Penny,"can i sit wherever i want? no, no, never mind, never mind, that’s, that’s not important. sheldon, this was big of you. thank you. i really appreciate it."
27300,Penny,"oh, we would love that."
25247,Penny,i don’t really want to.
24991,Penny,the what?
29183,Penny,more reasons for you to stay.
25517,Penny,"well, tell you one thing, if i ever do get married, no klingon invitations."
21925,Penny,hey leonard.
24306,Penny,"oh, hi. um, i gotta run. early shift."
28133,Penny,you went on a date last night? are you seeing someone?
27355,Penny,"or, maybe now that i’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure."
28386,Penny,"oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. we’ve all done it."
26589,Penny,what window?
27943,Penny,"okay, will you relax? you’re not missing anything special."
22489,Penny,"i swear to god, i am done with guys like that. you know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money."
27216,Penny,hi. what’s going on?
22926,Penny,"sheldon, i am very, very sorry."
23474,Penny,"okay, can someone please tell me what’s going on here?"
28974,Penny,"well, you’re home now."
23386,Penny,"it’s not a big deal, i was making coffee and i ran out of milk."
23468,Penny,"leonard, you’re back."
26476,Penny,"aha. okay, let’s see. to continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. ooh."
27148,Penny,how?
29065,Penny,"well, you sound like one now. i don’t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while."
29233,Penny,", bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?"
27767,Penny,really?
27484,Penny,"you know what? that was almost on topic. i’m gonna say good job, sheldon."
22741,Penny,"hi. you know, you probably don’t want to go in there."
27128,Penny,"yeah, it kind of does, huh?"
24585,Penny,"yeah, i got it, i got it. uh, zack, these are my friends bernadette and amy."
28932,Penny,"uh, hang on. i don’t think so, i’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but i’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets."
28411,Penny,"you know, to be fair, we did get married in vegas and didn’t invite her."
24278,Penny,what were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
24948,Penny,‘course i heard about it. how did you hear about it?
25771,Penny,"okay, go home, crazy man."
29513,Penny,hey.
25223,Penny,"well, good for you."
22246,Penny,"oh, well, then good!"
27877,Penny,thanks for cooking.
23622,Penny,i’m glad to hear it.
28753,Penny,"well, here’s your key."
27256,Penny,of course not. no one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face.
26072,Penny,as evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
27617,Penny,"sheldon, this isn’t that hard."
28830,Penny,"hey, that guy’s looking over here. "
25985,Penny,"no, leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll just keep me awake.  oh, i’ll get it."
23989,Penny,"well, i always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords."
28558,Penny,"oh, good for you."
29345,Penny,"you sick, geeky bastards!"
25222,Penny,that’s gross.
27983,Penny,yeah.
23396,Penny,why are you asking?
26900,Penny,yes.
23173,Penny,"what do you mean, nope? what’s wrong with it?"
23767,Penny,wait. you have to help me get into bed. sheldon has to get me into bed. bet you never thought i’d say that.
22654,Penny,"frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!"
28440,Penny,"if you guys would shut up, i could tell you. oh. be cool, be cool, be cool."
24861,Penny,all right. i’ll go change. come on in.
27939,Penny,she did?
23179,Penny,"oh, i love san francisco. i wish i was going with you."
28728,Penny,leonard hofstadter.
23086,Penny,"leonard, i’m not gonna call up kurt and ask him for money."
22655,Penny,what?
27063,Penny,"i didn’t know him very well, but i still really liked him. it’s weird that he’s just gone."
22415,Penny,"okay, here’s the deal, we are going to throw leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on saturday."
26630,Penny,"yeah, back when i was dating zack. it was actually more fun than i thought. we gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. which was surprising, since we were at a strip club."
29362,Penny,"leonard, ready to go?"
29450,Penny,who can’t go out with leonard?
26546,Penny,"i know what i did. i bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. you know, i can be romantic if i want to."
28744,Penny,"wait. why don’t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?"
27464,Penny,"so, dan, you have a grandson. how old is he?"
28739,Penny,i guess so. and i’d finally get to live alone with my husband.
23994,Penny,"sheldon, this is leonard’s decision. he invited me to switzerland, and i intend to go."
23930,Penny,"look, sheldon, sweetie, i know you’re feeling insecure, but we’ve really got to go to sleep."
23456,Penny,"well, i got you a little going away present."
28067,Penny,"thanks a lot, guys."
25178,Penny,i don’t have feelings.
27884,Penny,"well, we will. we’re just not in a rush."
22556,Penny,"oh, um, you know, i think i have the dinner shift on friday."
24647,Penny,"oh, great. you know what? i’ve already mooched dinner off you guys. i don’t need to listen to this."
23024,Penny,what is this?
22880,Penny,"nice to finally meet you, too."
29382,Penny,i need to use your window.
24688,Penny,"oh, don’t feel bad. i never read leonard’s, and i used to sleep with him."
24105,Penny,please just try this one on.
23191,Penny,"uh, no, i was talking to my friend, but what’s up?"
29024,Penny,hm. at least he took an interest. 
27850,Penny,"hey, sorry, got caught up at work. hi, beverly."
22738,Penny,"yeah, i’m busy, so, goodnight."
22148,Penny,"uh, what time is it?"
25272,Penny,"okay, but the jennifer aniston movie has jennifer aniston, and she’s not building a dam."
24554,Penny,"oh, dad, that’s nice, but leonard has to work. right, leonard?"
22347,Penny,"yeah, and the bag it came in. "
23834,Penny,not that far back!
29038,Penny,"okay. leonard, i really appreciate that, but i need a little time to myself."
26494,Penny,"well, where the hell’s the coin?"
24222,Penny,"yep, okay."
22424,Penny,"so, what did you get the birthday boy?"
25836,Penny,"relax, we got time, this is so fun."
28806,Penny,you poor thing.
26831,Penny,yeah.
24534,Penny,"wait. no, amy, you’re supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing."
25277,Penny,"okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?"
26463,Penny,"no, no. let’s mix things up. i choose sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!"
22839,Penny,is that friend wolowitz?
27917,Penny,"no, you told me."
22243,Penny,there you go. 
22096,Penny,"okay, kurt, please."
24271,Penny,what does that have to do with joyce kim?
25870,Penny,you’re kidding.
29274,Penny,hey.
25373,Penny,"ooh, look who’s out on a date. pasadena’s favourite power couple, shamy."
27178,Penny,"oh, thank you, but maybe i should cancel."
25338,Penny,"okay. if you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your wi-fi?"
26043,Penny,"yes, leonard, i am insecure. happy?"
28701,Penny,why would that make me feel better?
25851,Penny,37
22248,Penny,i really should have brought my own car. 
26079,Penny,i know. a hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
26252,Penny,okay. i’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.
21968,Penny,"thank you, i’ve got to talk to that mailman."
24047,Penny,what’s going on?
23797,Penny,"oh, yeah, you can’t sit there."
22823,Penny,thank you.
25871,Penny,ooh! what’s going on in here?
28998,Penny,there’s something on the windshield.
26058,Penny,i feel like you guys just went to comic-con.
22589,Penny,goodnight sheldon.
22658,Penny,that’s on the registration?
27402,Penny,"that, believe it or not, is my prom dress."
24836,Penny,oh. where’s raj?
29162,Penny,"she’ll be in her crate, it’s not a big deal."
27110,Penny,"leonard, you are really not cheering me up."
29087,Penny,maybe we should just call it a night.
25366,Penny,"yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut."
25841,Penny,"hey, sheldon, you’re always full of fun little facts. where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?"
28229,Penny,oh.
21908,Penny,"hey, leonard?"
24849,Penny,"oh. hi, amy. how you been?"
22198,Penny,"oh. you know you can just get one of those universal remotes at radio shack, they’re really cheap."

23115,Penny,what do you mean why?
26868,Penny,"yeah. well, sheldon’s not here."
23265,Penny,"leonard, help."

22058,Penny,"hmmm. good for him. good for leonard. okay, night."

22363,Penny,"damn, okay, i’ll just take the roof. "

27959,Penny,"no, no, no, go ahead. i’ll come up with something mushy, you’ll cry, we got this."
28906,Penny,"i, i knew the answer. i got excited."
28445,Penny,"hey, guys."

26688,Penny,yeah?

23066,Penny,"sheldon, look, i will pay you back as soon as i can. you just have to give me more time."
29164,Penny,mm-hmm.
27198,Penny,"well, the first few weeks will be all training. they’ll tell me everything i need to know."
22660,Penny,"yeah, hi, listen, as long as i’m here, i’m on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don’t know what they’re doing, we’ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank."
26426,Penny,"oh.  oh, that’s the pizza."
27771,Penny,seriously?
22824,Penny,understood.
22118,Penny,"well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she’s kind of family. "
24315,Penny,are you out of your mind?!
24176,Penny,"god, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?"
27152,Penny,so? he loves trains.
22527,Penny,"alright, the cat’s alive, let’s go to dinner. "
28232,Penny,"i told you if we were patient, he’d figure it out for himself."
24579,Penny,"you’re right. look, from now on, i will tell you the truth."
28051,Penny,yeah? how did it go? did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?
28589,Penny,"well, i’d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs."
27870,Penny,okay. were you talking before she got upset?
27162,Penny,be safe and call us.
24667,Penny,"look, can’t you just let him play with you until bedtime?"
29091,Penny,maybe the fact that you went and had a baby. 
28050,Penny,"fine, you want me to call? i’ll call. why am i so nervous?"
27224,Penny,that’s so hot.
27204,Penny,that is not true.
23483,Penny,"well, you know, i do understand what you’re going through."
24378,Penny,no.
22906,Penny,"so, how did the talk with stephanie go?"
28439,Penny,what?
25706,Penny,"why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?"
24304,Penny,"yeah, sorry about that."
28895,Penny,"well, that’s great, raj. you must have so much in common."
23027,Penny,wait! how many questions are on this thing?
27809,Penny,"i mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much i hated about that world. you, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. i don’t want to feel those things. i want to sell drugs to people who feel those things."
23748,Penny,nothing. the engine does that sometimes.
27826,Penny,oh. you could tell it to me.
22966,Penny,okay. 101 totally cool science experiments for kids.
29141,Penny,"hey, babe, you want to drive?"
25881,Penny,hmm.
27688,Penny,"well, maybe. but i’m still glad we did it. i do feel closer to you."
23287,Penny,"i tried making it better, he wouldn’t go for it."
26777,Penny,"oh. well, good boy."
28257,Penny,wow. you can really arrange that?
29299,Penny,"i mean, i like a little brown sugar."
26509,Penny,"okay, okay. but you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, i think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things."
22040,Penny,"uh, which one, the classic burger, the ranch house burger, the barbecue burger or the kobe burger?"
25402,Penny,he’s not dying.
29102,Penny,"you know, we could’ve come to you guys. you didn’t have to bring the baby here."
24193,Penny,"oh, god, i feel terrible."
23888,Penny,"well, let’s go find out who."
23431,Penny,i said i don’t want to talk about it.
29009,Penny,"oh, that is so thoughtful."
28665,Penny,"well, i learned from the best."
25200,Penny,"ooh, maybe a little rodeo drive."
27205,Penny,"i told you, they’ll be right out."
28514,Penny,"because i don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. i mean, i know i make a lot of money. but i haven’t been happy for a while."
27865,Penny,"it’s okay, go ahead."
22821,Penny,"good night, sheldon."
23611,Penny,"yeah, well, it’s your fault."
25459,Penny,"sorry, just remembered i’ve got to stop by the drugstore."
27867,Penny,"well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables."
28243,Penny,"come on, sheldon. there are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems."
28888,Penny,i know i went a little overboard. we can always dial it back.
23308,Penny,"that’s why i work at the cheesecake factory, i’m holding out for the right part."
22918,Penny,"okay, let me check."
26453,Penny,"come on, don’t be like that. we had so much fun together the last couple of months."
22529,Penny,"yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question."
28565,Penny,"oh. zack, hi. you guys remember zack."
27062,Penny,"i just never knew anyone that died. i had a pet pig when i was a kid. i mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue."
22064,Penny,"well, a little bird told me that you and lesley hooked up last night. "
23584,Penny,that’s great.
28049,Penny,"you’re not gonna let this go, are you?"
24088,Penny,"that’s no reason to back out. you know, i once got a pretty big honour in high school, and i was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but i went through with it, and you know what? the world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a ford f-150 as a member of the corn queen’s court."
27822,Penny,what?
25239,Penny,what do you tell him?
27960,Penny,wow.
22943,Penny,i never said that.
25783,Penny,mmm.
27508,Penny,"no. we’re always doing what you guys want. just once, it’d be nice if you did something we wanted."
22531,Penny,right.
23864,Penny,so what did she say when you told her we were going out?
21889,Penny,"so, klingon boggle?"
24457,Penny,okay. good.
22453,Penny,"why, is leonard okay."
28819,Penny,it doesn’t matter. i’m not doing it.
27004,Penny,"okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?"
24484,Penny,oh. i’m sorry.
26408,Penny,that’s your big revelation?
27975,Penny,you work with her? how could you not tell me that?
26670,Penny,"wow, you’re really good at this."
28613,Penny,"no problem. um, so listen, i don’t know if you have any plans next weekend, but i kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time."
28583,Penny,"fine, if you really want me to, i will pick your mom up."
22825,Penny,"yeah, just move your stupid scooter before i pick it up and throw it in the dumpster."
28415,Penny,"oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. look, at some point, raj will try to get everyone to do the electric slide. now, that will ruin it."
22163,Penny,no.
25412,Penny,yeah?
23551,Penny,"uh, yeah, i think we’ll pass."
22317,Penny,"oh, sheldon, can’t you do that yourself?"
22269,Penny,"it’s okay, i do, look, leonard is helping sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with dr farmin..farm…ian"
25187,Penny,wil wheaton is sheldon’s mortal enemy.
24284,Penny,um…
22258,Penny,what do you want?
23569,Penny,i guess i could serve both.
22204,Penny,"so, how’s it going with sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other? "
23077,Penny,tv star.
25564,Penny,"you’re talking about the painting, right?"
27525,Penny,do i really force you to do things you don’t want to?
27810,Penny,"i did. i mean, i walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then i walked right out."
24411,Penny,it’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.
26740,Penny,oh.
25286,Penny,"all right, i’d like an order of fries."
28171,Penny,"uh, i don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing."
23872,Penny,"yeah, i gotta put a sticker over that. so, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce."
23642,Penny,until half time.
24141,Penny,you’re kidding.
23100,Penny,"fellas, please."
22023,Penny,what now?
26120,Penny,"oh, please let some of it be xanax."
23090,Penny,"oh, leonard, honey, if we started living together, i wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you."
25393,Penny,"okay, look, he bought you this."
22505,Penny,"oh, that’s nice. anyhow, the thing i wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since leonard and i have become friends, i was just… want to sit down? "
24696,Penny,brawny?
28745,Penny,"okay, it won’t be that bad. we wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone."
25919,Penny,you are such an ass. this is exactly why i didn’t want to tell you i was taking a class in the first place.
24717,Penny,"oh, right, right, the blog."
28359,Penny,it is freaking amazing.
28438,Penny,ooh. you’re gonna make out so hard tonight.
26826,Penny,"i’m serious. who wants to do all that stuff? have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car."
28279,Penny,that’s interesting.
25208,Penny,it’s open.
25629,Penny,"oh my god, i love this chicken."
25074,Penny,how did you know i was here?
27514,Penny,"well, that’s wilshire’s problem. come on, you know, there, there’s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate."
26220,Penny,"sure. just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? not, like, capes and tights and crap?"
28404,Penny,"you know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come."
28151,Penny,i knew i could smell ’em.
25046,Penny,"oh, no, no, no. i’ve had way too much already."
25943,Penny,"yeah, amy told me what happened. look, just apologize. it’ll warm her twaddle."
22829,Penny,"okay, where is he going?"
23349,Penny,"oh, what a cute, little store. everybody’s staring at me."
29225,Penny,the notebook isn’t in the bathroom.
23917,Penny,"you know, i believe in ghosts, too."
22750,Penny,"uh, yeah, no, that’s not it."
22122,Penny,why?
29033,Penny,let’s go.
25781,Penny,what the hell is wrong with you? you told sheldon? do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? 
28423,Penny,is that a pregnancy thing?
25866,Penny,"yeah, you’re really just making it worse."
26307,Penny,guess who?
22913,Penny,what?
27383,Penny,you were okay with that?
29057,Penny,"hey, would you take a look at my brother’s résumé? i’m trying to help him clean it up a little."
25597,Penny,"all right, sweetie, i’m not going to get involved in your relationship."
28032,Penny,yes.
27013,Penny,"yeah. sounds like me. come on, sheldon. what do you say?"
24374,Penny,"uh, yeah, i wouldn’t say many. a few. "
23811,Penny,"come on, sheldon, this is important to me."
28651,Penny,"oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? when beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. all right? as far as you’re concerned, you don’t know anything, you didn’t see anything. i want you just to play dumb."
29100,Penny,"okay, i want in. ten bucks says i’ll lose interest before that thing stops spinning."
23817,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
29098,Penny,what is happening?
27046,Penny,"yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire."
26941,Penny,"aw, stuart. now i feel bad for murdering you."
24885,Penny,"hey, you. what happened with the contacts?"
28226,Penny,hey. where’d you go? i can’t tell if the turkey’s done.
27319,Penny,you guys look like you’re having fun.
24636,Penny,like there’s a difference.
27458,Penny,"oh, dan. my boss who didn’t want to hire me and now’s a little hug machine."
26937,Penny,"in 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?"
26038,Penny,"don’t play dumb with me, ricardo shilly-shally!"
27196,Penny,"uh, not yet, but i will."
24555,Penny,oh.
23940,Penny,born and raised. 
24406,Penny,oh. and the flash shirt is what? because you’re gonna run really fast?
24229,Penny,"hey, sheldon."
24614,Penny,what great news?
25894,Penny,"oh, i’ll get that."
26459,Penny,i love scavenger hunts. my friends and i had them all the time.
28019,Penny,"oh, damn it, you topped it. should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?"
28864,Penny,the woman at the wall store?
22684,Penny,yes it is.
27873,Penny,"well, sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her."
25583,Penny,"well, sorry, i don’t know any dirty jokes."
27677,Penny,you ready?
27220,Penny,that’s so cool. congratulations. i guess that makes you the athlete of the group.
27804,Penny,"yeah, uh, i got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep."
26872,Penny,really? this one?
22388,Penny,"missy, i’m going to go get my nails done. do you want to come?"
29197,Penny,"okay, how is that?"
28434,Penny,"okay, answer it. just be strong. and if she starts to cry, don’t make any promises. and most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear."
23710,Penny,"okay, you can have that one."
23620,Penny,hi.
27033,Penny,"thank you. hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these."
26309,Penny,"oh, don’t worry, sweetie. no one has."
23104,Penny,i think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.
23110,Penny,"okay. you know, i’ve always been curious. what was leonard like when he was little?"
21891,Penny,participate in the what?
29095,Penny,"yeah, i guess i am making decent money. "
29319,Penny,"well, what do you want us to do?"
23409,Penny,your home is twenty feet from here.
25228,Penny,what does your gut tell you?
28086,Penny,how about thai food?
29144,Penny,just say you want to drive.
22982,Penny,"well, someone had to say it.  what?"
26320,Penny,"okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…"
28748,Penny,"that was a cute story. so, um, what did you want to ask me?"
25205,Penny,"hey, guys."
27934,Penny,"so, what package are you thinking?"
23049,Penny,i’ll pay you back as soon as i can.
26997,Penny,"okay, what do you think?"
28385,Penny,"oh, tell us."
27605,Penny,i’m sorry i didn’t have a camera.
25300,Penny,good! go! there are some girls right over there. what are you waiting for?
23663,Penny,"sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. oh, and fyi, you never even heard of the black eyed peas until you met me!"
22953,Penny,"nice save, genius. eggnog?"
27901,Penny,"no, it’s okay."
29452,Penny,"all right, guys, you have to go back. i can’t afford you. “no, don’t send"
26988,Penny,no.
23924,Penny,"good night. that was weird, even for him."
24154,Penny,still don’t get it.
25718,Penny,"amy, you look great."
28236,Penny,i’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
25800,Penny,"of course, it is, it’s been in the news. and it’s a very famous boson."
23267,Penny,"here, this will help."
23713,Penny,"he’s a musician. he’ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to."
25037,Penny,"okay, priya?"
27898,Penny,fine. i want to release butterflies.
28731,Penny,"wow, you popular girls are mean."
26966,Penny,"okay, like what? show me."
25304,Penny,"huh? i’m sorry, get what?"
22223,Penny,"okay, well, i guess we’re back to the corduroy suit. "
25861,Penny,letting him make me happy.
29334,Penny,"okay, i know you don’t have a lot of experience with women, but ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you."
25862,Penny,i guess i could probably try a little harder.
25346,Penny,"oh, terrific. high school quarterback against four mathletes."
22131,Penny,"well, it’s been fun."
24681,Penny,"bored. okay. these are steve maddens. these are nine west. these are target. oh, but don’t they look like chanel? these are michael kors. these are roxy. these are sachel’s. oh, these are betsy johnson, they’re so cute…"
28699,Penny,and you talked?
26381,Penny,really? why?
23139,Penny,"so you’re saying you’re not having sex with me, you’re having sex with your mother?"
23596,Penny,"wow, you really are a genius."
21866,Penny,hi?
22665,Penny,"creepy, howard."
22451,Penny,"sheldon, we have to go."
22899,Penny,"believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers."
23391,Penny,"oh, god, i don’t know sheldon, are you star wars?"
28235,Penny,"okay, great. what is it?"
22129,Penny,"this plasma grenade.  ha! look, it’s raining you! "
29367,Penny,little ball of fur. 
22309,Penny,"really, never?"
26052,Penny,"i can’t help it. but, look, i figured i could sit around and feel insecure, or i could do something about it. so i got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes."
22380,Penny,hi mike.
24313,Penny,"oh. hey, leonard."
22863,Penny,"sheldon, what do you want?"
23858,Penny,what? your… your mother’s coming? when?
26590,Penny,"ooh, what are you gonna get?"
24940,Penny,give my friend his stuff back.
27526,Penny,how is it okay?
26790,Penny,"yeah, i need to start cracking the window when i leave you in the car."
28373,Penny,"don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. all right, how you want to do this?"
21982,Penny,how?
26701,Penny,"oh, my inference is justified. sheldon, you are so funny. anyway, i need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them."
28910,Penny,there you go.
25256,Penny,"oh, amy! get the hell out of here!"
28694,Penny,"oh, you know, i also lied about the girl in the bathroom. yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth."
23434,Penny,"leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?"
28539,Penny,may i take your cloak?
23421,Penny,you know your friend stuart?
25470,Penny,"bug report: when a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching tv."
24335,Penny,"look, sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, i don’t know, maybe actually spending some time with her."
21994,Penny,"wow, centrifugal force!"
22593,Penny,"okay, i get it, i get it, i get it."
23436,Penny,what the hell is that?
22052,Penny,"alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn’t want to be disturbed because they’re, you know, getting busy. "
25007,Penny,haven’t seen you in a while. how’s it going?
26322,Penny,"not really. my shirt was soaking wet. i got, like, the biggest tip of my life."
28071,Penny,"phone, now."
29311,Penny,did he purell?
26836,Penny,aw. you are the best boyfriend ever.
24894,Penny,then no.
25974,Penny,yeah.
23617,Penny,"i would’ve invited you, but i know you’re not a football fan."
39976,Sheldon,"that’s okay, i never understood them anyway."
37674,Sheldon,"well, we could if it were true. but as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. the variable which has changed is the coitus."
34737,Sheldon,what?
38037,Sheldon,hello.
35084,Sheldon,i understand why no-one else bid. 
37675,Sheldon,"good, good. i’m glad we’re still friends."
40971,Sheldon,"well, i had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. now, as i was saying, based on the content…"
43171,Sheldon,"i think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. so what’s the plan?"
36566,Sheldon,do you remember the grant proposal i submitted to the national science foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic north pole?
45351,Sheldon,can you read them back?
40885,Sheldon,hello.
43906,Sheldon,i look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.
38930,Sheldon,coming.
36038,Sheldon,"only 211. don’t worry, in deference to you, i’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level."
41663,Sheldon,"when i thought the element was real, i didn’t want it. but now that leonard made it not exist, i want it more than anything in the world."
42740,Sheldon,"my uncle was accused of that, too. it turned out to be legal in oklahoma."
43825,Sheldon,this is leonard. he’s your best friend in the world.
38843,Sheldon,thank you.
36190,Sheldon,"no. despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. now i’m done."
35759,Sheldon,you have two strikes. three strikes and you’re out. it’s a sports metaphor.
41546,Sheldon,"because as it just so happens, i’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. isn’t that right, new friend and colleague bill nye the science guy. sorry, i replaced you with a newer model."
34618,Sheldon,coming. 
39025,Sheldon,"thank you. if you think about it, greek food isn’t that far from italian food. they share a spice palette. and what a civilization is the greeks. they gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat."
39856,Sheldon,"how’s counting going? when i was in kindergarten, i recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. i think i got this."
36230,Sheldon,"i understand your envy. this is a can’t-miss symposium. there are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium green’s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms."
36315,Sheldon,and you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while i’m doing so.
38937,Sheldon,are you todd zarnecki?
36104,Sheldon,"well, you didn’t specify."
45394,Sheldon,why?
40560,Sheldon,cookie.
40680,Sheldon,"ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?"
37154,Sheldon,it’s not. that’s why leonard does it.
39829,Sheldon,"but if i don’t come into work, what am i supposed to do with myself?"
38106,Sheldon,help me move my desk.
41154,Sheldon,wait. wait. and says?
41945,Sheldon,"well, with that sorted out, i’m happy to answer your question, bernadette. howard started it."
44482,Sheldon,i’m not sorry. that’s true.
43661,Sheldon,i told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.
44881,Sheldon,"bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives."
39530,Sheldon,"age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. need i go on?"
38594,Sheldon,"well, i suppose it’s appropriate."
34564,Sheldon,what about comic-books?
37964,Sheldon,"flattering, but sadly, no. i’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. aka jogging."
43039,Sheldon,aah! and after i let you be gary.
42324,Sheldon,"oh, of course it’s no big deal to you. you idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on."
42864,Sheldon,of course.
41796,Sheldon,namaste.
44979,Sheldon,"yes, you’re in trouble, you went to wizarding world without me."
40134,Sheldon,now will you give my paper to hawking?
34782,Sheldon,what did he say?
39474,Sheldon,"ladies, please. these four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. but through no one’s fault, penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. and again, i’m looking at no one in particular, penny."
37619,Sheldon,"we would indeed. in this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage."
42508,Sheldon,"yeah, exactly. did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?"
36835,Sheldon,english is your native language.
45081,Sheldon,"i did this for free, let me get a little something."
42777,Sheldon,you should point out the hypocrisy of that.
38615,Sheldon,i trust penny will adhere to the official california restaurant workers’ solemn oath of ethics and cleanliness.”
37264,Sheldon,when does the csi team get here?
44237,Sheldon,"look at the 4k resolution. next time we skype, i’m gonna count all those nostril hairs."
34349,Sheldon,sarcasm?
44839,Sheldon,"oh, yes, you are. i track your cycle. for the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field."
41202,Sheldon,"oh, i see a space in the white zone. quick, circle the airport."
35553,Sheldon,even though the menu description specifies shredded?
43617,Sheldon,"okay. but don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man."
44667,Sheldon,how dare you?
38757,Sheldon,"that’s a good idea, get your rest. there are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and daddy needs a new linear accelerator. and i thought he didn’t learn anything from his relationship with you."
34359,Sheldon,"penny, penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.  well that was a little non-responsive."
39265,Sheldon,"is not. is not, is not."
44808,Sheldon,thank you.
35291,Sheldon,"alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?"
44654,Sheldon,be grateful i’m still in the room.
36193,Sheldon,"hello, penny."
41657,Sheldon,you robbed me of my greatest achievement.
40695,Sheldon,"well, that snuck up on us, didn’t it?"
37374,Sheldon,"all right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. beer-battered fish and chips. now, here’s your tartar sauce. i also brought you salsa. it’s a little unconventional, but i think you’ll like it. it’s zingy. and for you, factory burrito grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. bon appétit."
40626,Sheldon,"in a perfect world, i’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. that probably requires a permit."
39887,Sheldon,shut it. offices are assigned by seniority. i arrived at the university first.
39734,Sheldon,did you have fun doing it?
44707,Sheldon,hello.
40356,Sheldon,"oh, that hardly seems fair. but i guess any team that i’m not on has a decided disadvantage."
44565,Sheldon,"oh, while you do that i am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts."
34517,Sheldon,just come with me.
44304,Sheldon,i can’t believe penny hasn’t.
43858,Sheldon,by seeing the movie she’d want me to see?
41416,Sheldon,why not? hairy fairy.
43874,Sheldon,"well, amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so i was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the wisconsin sheep and wool festival."
44766,Sheldon,your klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.
38537,Sheldon,"because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. fyi, my mother’s birthday is coming up. i’m going to need you to pick up a present."
35929,Sheldon,"that being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together."
41896,Sheldon,you’ll get ’em next time.
35055,Sheldon,4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
41734,Sheldon,i don’t get it.
41397,Sheldon,"um, i’m putting on lotion. are you in or not?"
43366,Sheldon,"if that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can."
43736,Sheldon,"thank you for coming by, gentlemen."
37163,Sheldon,"you’re kidding, right? it’s a bust of sir isaac newton."
35470,Sheldon,"there you go, one enchanted sword."
37458,Sheldon,i’m not going to pay a fine. that would imply i’m guilty.
45132,Sheldon,"oh, it’s fine. you needed a suitcase, i wasn’t home, you borrowed a suitcase."
42763,Sheldon,they’re perfect. it tastes like her hugs.
37975,Sheldon, penny.
41373,Sheldon,because you’ve been training for this your whole life. you live in a pile of dirty laundry.
42999,Sheldon,"well, i haven’t. and while they say never meet your heroes, i just don’t see how i could disappoint. who would you choose?"
42542,Sheldon,good. little claustrophobic.
44920,Sheldon,oh. remember when we got this at comic-con?
42835,Sheldon,done.
39686,Sheldon,nonsense. i look like a train conductor. under what pretext did you lure her here?
37721,Sheldon,"no. it’s just a suspicion i have. mmm, mmm, mmm."
34958,Sheldon,"no, he would be exactly the same. "
38713,Sheldon,"it’s not a touch phobia, it’s a germ phobia. if you’d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,"
42182,Sheldon,"oh, i’m not going to the funeral."
43546,Sheldon,"no, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that’s on you. all right. oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. in which case, all glory to the hive queen. all right, now all that’s left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates."
44100,Sheldon,"speaking of ending relationships, when british honduras became belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and i would like to hang myself from that tree."
44475,Sheldon,"mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire."
36380,Sheldon,i’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
40919,Sheldon,"she tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. don’t worry. luckily, i had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river."
40158,Sheldon,"yeah, i do. . as is the tradition, i have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at howard’s expense. prepare to have your ribs tickled. howard, i always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. am i right? let’s see here. oh, seriously though, howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people i know. and that’s a zinger, because you’re not. i’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. assuming you’d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which i don’t see as likely. hacha! okay, let me see here. okay, kidding aside, howard, you are a good friend. and i wish you nothing but happiness. bazinga, i don’t!"
36871,Sheldon,got it. got it. got it. got it. got it. got it. betty and veronica? ugh.
45247,Sheldon,why?
42004,Sheldon,who was he?
45297,Sheldon,"i had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. boy, you’re good."
39422,Sheldon,"and just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people."
45156,Sheldon,"i said to myself, i think i can, i think i can. and then i couldn’t, so i paid two men who promised not to come rob us later."
41360,Sheldon,not with a bowling ball on their back.
35263,Sheldon,we’re not done? 
40039,Sheldon,they’re mint in box.
44720,Sheldon,don’t get me all randy. guests are on the way.
36970,Sheldon,"no, i believe leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize."
43758,Sheldon,"well, that last hunger games was not my cup of tea."
45791,Sheldon,because i called shotgun. remember?
37759,Sheldon,"yes. and until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. we’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. and now she’s under consideration for a position at our university."
40435,Sheldon,trying to use a jedi mind trick to control stephen hawking. play. play. ugh! he must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.
35547,Sheldon,now?
34569,Sheldon,"i don’t care if anybody gets it, i’m going as the doppler effect. "
37831,Sheldon,"thank you. raj, keep an eye out for the other one."
35723,Sheldon,"oh, you want me to share credit?"
41163,Sheldon,and now what?
42910,Sheldon,"i do, indeed, mr. box-thinking."
36800,Sheldon,and you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? highly unethical for an astrophysicist. although practically mandatory for a pirate.
35672,Sheldon,i never eat in strange restaurants. one runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
35714,Sheldon,come on! don’t nitpick!
36803,Sheldon,i was going to say sad. i don’t know why i hedged.
39288,Sheldon,not my fault. you said there’d be other scientists there my age.
36277,Sheldon,that’s the wrong box. put it back.
34800,Sheldon,"you hit me. you saw him, he hit me."
38654,Sheldon,"hmm, no. one slip of the hand, and suddenly i’m sitting in the engineering department, building doodads with wolowitz."
42069,Sheldon,okay.
35805,Sheldon,what did i do?
44581,Sheldon,i am facing a great deal of work. and i do like things better when famous people also like them.
40577,Sheldon,no. that’s it. i am calling campus security. you prepare for the scolding of your life.
43740,Sheldon,"all i’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. she should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight."
44086,Sheldon,not a clue. raj?
41201,Sheldon,"all right, you have to get out of the car right now. i’m not going to jail for you."
39093,Sheldon,"blue, as in depressed."
44827,Sheldon,"look, look, here i am standing next to the incubator. uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells."
42885,Sheldon,that’s not gonna work.
35007,Sheldon,"of course he has, the oracle told us little neo was the one. you can see the matrix, can’t you."
41930,Sheldon,"no. sorry to disappoint you, but amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me."
35421,Sheldon,"given this situation, i have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with leonard."
44001,Sheldon,"what? i apologized and i meant it. i know that we don’t play this game very often, but you’re doing it wrong."
36383,Sheldon,welcome to the building.
40181,Sheldon,super mario bros. theme?
39840,Sheldon,"one time they tried to make richard feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. he went to work in his friend’s biology lab. richard feynman was a famous american physicist, part of the manhattan project."
37988,Sheldon,thank you. 
43785,Sheldon,very well. i know you’ve been seeing other men. have you had coitus with any of them?
35971,Sheldon,of course i do. the essence of the custom is that i now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me. it’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
36854,Sheldon,"wait, you have to drive me home."
45249,Sheldon,hello.
42602,Sheldon,"next time i might be in a rush, it’s good to have a few in the bank."
40905,Sheldon,"gosh, penny, what’d you have for breakfast? a big glass of good question juice? the nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. spread your legs, invite them in."
38304,Sheldon,mockery? that’s all you have to offer?
37242,Sheldon,"raj, i highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider."
44012,Sheldon,"and i want you to know that i mean it, you know? this isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to las vegas."
36356,Sheldon,"look at planck’s constant. people say it’s arbitrary. it could not be less arbitrary. if it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. bam! now, now, let’s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. bam! this is a space where we are all essentially alice through the looking glass, standing in front the red queen, and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. bam! of course, in another universe, let’s call it universe prime, there’s another sheldon, let’s call him sheldon prime…"
39099,Sheldon,"then as a mental exercise i invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. can you believe this guy? social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need."
43076,Sheldon,"you just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?"
45587,Sheldon,"i must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. don’t you agree?"
36962,Sheldon,"i believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. the movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on colorado boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination."
35026,Sheldon,"and of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds."
43423,Sheldon,"well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date."
37207,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, raj, i have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s."
34686,Sheldon,"yes, but you didn’t portray her as completely irrational."
45495,Sheldon,"hey, i thought you were sweet on me."
41961,Sheldon,"leonard, would you wrap it up? we’re waiting on you."
39922,Sheldon,"you don’t get it, do you? that’s a mockingbird. mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of tune on purpose. he’s mocking me. oh dear. there it is again. do you feel it?"
42229,Sheldon,good. i thought she saw something on my forehead.
43371,Sheldon,"but you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date."
42361,Sheldon,no one signed up.
39902,Sheldon,"well, of course. scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons spock, spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves spock, spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
45546,Sheldon,and don’t forget to skype me when you arrive.
45053,Sheldon,and if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?
35025,Sheldon,of course. 
44779,Sheldon,qu’vatlh 
40830,Sheldon,"that would be ideal. if a person like that existed, i would sign on, no further questions asked."
39452,Sheldon,science. you wouldn’t understand.
44370,Sheldon,"you know, it’s like how i play warlords of ka’a with you and elder sign with frank and alicia."
37131,Sheldon,tests. here. it’s college-ruled. i hope that’s not too intimidating.
45157,Sheldon,"interesting. well, so i was right."
35320,Sheldon,nothing. you seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and penny where obviously none exists.
43475,Sheldon," amy. hmm. tables work, too. good to know."
36652,Sheldon,"hello, penny. i realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may i interrupt this one?"
34680,Sheldon,it’s halo night.
41919,Sheldon,"no. you’ve opened my eyes to the truth. amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. and that stops now."
35616,Sheldon,"oh, but i’m not going home. it’s wednesday, wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. and then we have to stop at soup plantation, it’s creamy tomato soup day, and radio shack, there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. plus, we have to go to pottery barn and return my star wars sheets."
34937,Sheldon,"it was tornado season. and it was an aluminium house. anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak any english, when i finally managed to convince her i was sick, she said “möchtest du eine darmspülung?”"
42401,Sheldon,laminate the core material.
37683,Sheldon,i’d rather you pretend i didn’t say it. i see you bought mama italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
35405,Sheldon,i have to make pee-pee.
35710,Sheldon,all right.
34967,Sheldon,"keen observation, goodbye. "
45599,Sheldon,"penny, look. i appreciate your concern, but i don’t think that’s what’s happening."
36595,Sheldon,"i don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, i’m going to the arctic circle with leonard, wolowitz and koothrappali."
43227,Sheldon,"i want to say no, but it’s too glorious. get in here."
41642,Sheldon,why are you here?
41787,Sheldon,"a fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time."
36398,Sheldon,"you know, penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. when this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains."
38905,Sheldon,"no. glenn’s was leather. he was a simple ostrich. is! is, i haven’t given up hope."
42561,Sheldon,"i apologize. i just, i’m plagued by an internal struggle."
44402,Sheldon,"good choice. critical hit. your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. with its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. it’s low sodium. aaaah."
34842,Sheldon,remember how leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
40544,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, 294?"
40551,Sheldon,very well. you leave me no choice.
38242,Sheldon,you’re far too short to be darth vader. at best you might be a turncoat ewok.
41644,Sheldon,"oh, nonsense, wil. your endless tweets are not that bad."
41661,Sheldon,leonard disproved my element. now all the attention is going to go away.
40962,Sheldon,"howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?"
39089,Sheldon,you know i’m right.
43994,Sheldon,"fine. leonard made me soup, and i was mean to him. hey, i felt a little something. let me try again. leonard made me soup, and i was mean to him. i was mean to him. he must have felt terrible. oh, now i feel terrible. neat."
45732,Sheldon,"leonard, are you in bed?"
39359,Sheldon,not yet.
37267,Sheldon,i’m not crazy. my mother had me tested.
38424,Sheldon,wrong. the best number is 73. you’re probably wondering why.
40482,Sheldon,enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. the manager recognized wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. right next to it. i was closer to it than i am to you right now.
35088,Sheldon,yeah. 
37137,Sheldon,"project gorilla, entry two. i am exhausted."
44172,Sheldon,"little generic. keep thinking. we’ll circle back. wil wheaton, go."
36228,Sheldon,"stop. we can’t do this, it’s not right."
42606,Sheldon,there are post-prom mating rituals?
40805,Sheldon,"no, i gave it to her well. now, over here, i was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…"
36782,Sheldon,"no, of course not. we’re talking very mild electric shocks. no tissue damage whatsoever."
42399,Sheldon,"yeah, try me."
36600,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?"
38254,Sheldon,"you met her at pasadena’s most popular irish watering hole, lucky baldwin’s, where maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams."
43016,Sheldon,"so, it would be today? huh. well, i suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday."
38075,Sheldon,"ah, then you may find zazzles a little cloying."
44828,Sheldon,"aw. yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in amy’s lab."
37202,Sheldon,detailed analysis posted online.
36856,Sheldon,"i can’t. there’s a big dog outside. on the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 gev particles."
35742,Sheldon,is my hamburger medium well?
38644,Sheldon,"good evening. i’m your guest lecturer, dr. sheldon cooper. i was expecting applause, but i suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. i agreed to speak to you this evening, because i was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. hmm. of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. best and brightest, my sweet patootie. all right, let’s begin. show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? don’t kid yourselves."
40630,Sheldon,why?
44642,Sheldon,oh. bye.
43186,Sheldon,"before i answer, was he a smoker? i think you’re looking at this all wrong."
45443,Sheldon,"okay. so, feynman, einstein and schrodinger walk into a bar. feynman says, it appears"
34293,Sheldon,"don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone."
38389,Sheldon,"munching on complimentary popcorn. woot, woot. oh, the gall. i hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot."
34486,Sheldon,it’s my idea of what dna would look like in a silicon based life form. 
45594,Sheldon,that doesn’t make any sense. she knows i have a girlfriend.
39036,Sheldon,"no, thank you, but for the record, i’m an excellent dancer. proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha."
35967,Sheldon,"in the pre-christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. this custom was later appropriated by northern europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called christmas tree."
37038,Sheldon,where is the passenger side mirror?
44650,Sheldon,"ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?"
37434,Sheldon,chicken?
42177,Sheldon,what are you doing?
39063,Sheldon,"that was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here."
34551,Sheldon,"terrific, you’ll be happy to know that i plan to come here every tuesday night for the foreseeable future."
43279,Sheldon,all right.
38917,Sheldon,"i don’t know if you’ve been following the news, leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture."
39161,Sheldon,"i must say, amy, i was very impressed to see that bernadette got her phd."
42093,Sheldon,"it was. this seemed so elegant at the time, but now i realize i was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places."
38864,Sheldon,"i think i figured out wolowitz’s magic trick, and i need you to pick a card."
35423,Sheldon,smart? i’d have to lose 60 iq points to be classified as smart.
44964,Sheldon,"that’s a bit childish, isn’t it? "
36880,Sheldon,"in the words of khan noonien singh in the immortal wrath of khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and i shall have him."
43306,Sheldon,check.
44854,Sheldon,i know how to behave.
40289,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i knocked on the front door, but you didn’t hear it."
41454,Sheldon,"yeah, i thought so, too, but she’s acting very strangely. i was discussing it with a sri lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice."
39818,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i think i’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. physics mad-libs. now, give me a number."
40731,Sheldon,"shh, he said it’s interesting."
44552,Sheldon,"oh, leonard’s mad at me, so i’m making him lemon bars."
39988,Sheldon,"yes. i’m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. can you recommend a gift?"
38613,Sheldon,probably serving food that was ordered today.
36943,Sheldon,"you’re a natural at this, penny. and as the first beta testers, you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with wolowitz and koothrappali on sunday."
43771,Sheldon,and feel free to tell your guest that the myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. in case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy.
34497,Sheldon,i’m not quite sure. it involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me. 
35357,Sheldon,i promised penny. 
42362,Sheldon,"i called the department secretary to see what happened. apparently, i have a reputation for being obnoxious."
36877,Sheldon,"i was such a fan that in 1995, i travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in jackson, mississippi, wearing my star fleet academy cadet uniform in order to meet wil wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package wesley crusher action figure."
42430,Sheldon,kind of? it does it perfectly.
35323,Sheldon,"there’s no reason to bring my looks into this. good day, leonard."
44376,Sheldon,"or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby."
37631,Sheldon, penny.
34631,Sheldon,"why? oh, penny, penny, penny."
35843,Sheldon,what is shaking?
41628,Sheldon,this is a jewish house. i don’t think they have pigskin.
35281,Sheldon,"just like schrodinger’s cat, your potential relationship with leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. it is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is. "
38273,Sheldon,"well, sure."
36349,Sheldon,"penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. observe. hey! less talk, more work!"
38405,Sheldon,"you went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?"
44875,Sheldon,"uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?"
35912,Sheldon,"just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears."
35033,Sheldon,"the objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if i know them, why shouldn’t i give them? "
44054,Sheldon,isn’t that the best? she’s like grandma spider-man.
40430,Sheldon,it’s been three days. why hasn’t stephen hawking played a word?
44375,Sheldon,yes. and we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.
40061,Sheldon,mmmmm!
44698,Sheldon,i came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.
40556,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but could you be more specific?"
43801,Sheldon,very well done.
43213,Sheldon,roughing it? okay. everything looks so big from down here. this must be how leonard feels.
36969,Sheldon,"this is a restaurant. it’s lunchtime. i would think, as a waitress, you’d be familiar with the paradigm."
36207,Sheldon,"you claim it’s going to be a week, but i have no faith in your dry cleaner."
44053,Sheldon,"yeah. and you never will. ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. do it, ask her."
40904,Sheldon,"if our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it’s to go where the wind takes you. as long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. and, action. so, penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?"
41073,Sheldon,by playing tic-tac-toe?
43832,Sheldon,i wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.
39752,Sheldon,"oh, no, of course. i understand. you’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. your secret’s safe with me."
35773,Sheldon,thank you.
45227,Sheldon,what emergency happened at the l.a. zoo?
36860,Sheldon,"photographic is a misnomer. i have an eidetic memory, as i’ve told you many times. most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. you had turkey and complained it was dry."
40783,Sheldon,i can’t go in today. i’m sick.
43568,Sheldon,"you can. i’m happy when you come home. and i’m scared of fireworks. by the way, on july fourth, we’re all sleeping here."
36810,Sheldon,nailed it.
35019,Sheldon,"or the one. dammit, i’ll do it. "
41034,Sheldon,glad.
40928,Sheldon,"oh, brilliant. i’ve been itching to pull that trigger."
42644,Sheldon,i’m listening to you snore. i’m wondering how i’ll ever sleep without it.
36665,Sheldon,"because i am without friends. like the proverbial cheese, i stand alone. even while seated."
38223,Sheldon,"very well, i’m sure i can find something that will help you ditch that itch."
35350,Sheldon,"oh, i forgot about lee meriwether."
39533,Sheldon,"you’re biologists. biology is the study of living things. that’s a living thing, get cracking."
39771,Sheldon,hold on. are you saying that you want to invoke clause 209?
41674,Sheldon,"i have two words for you, jurassic park. this day just keeps getting worse and worse."
36966,Sheldon,"leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago i told you not to talk to her, and now look, we’re going to be late for the movies."
38529,Sheldon,of texas.
37768,Sheldon,the stock boy at walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
42775,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry, leonard, i’m a problem-solver, it’s what i do."
39562,Sheldon,"and may i point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with stuart and amy, not me. i think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here. "
34715,Sheldon,fine. i’ll have a virgin cuba libre. 
45275,Sheldon,"oh, i’m outraged. "
37687,Sheldon,"oh, it’s all right, i do. oh! you’re in for what my mother calls a real eye-talian treat. ."
42540,Sheldon,"uh, let’s see. 704? no, wait, it’s on clock. uh, the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees."
35668,Sheldon,the fact is i’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
36704,Sheldon,"i’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. in fact, when i was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house."
41437,Sheldon,"ah, sweden. yeah, home of my favourite muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. okay, the nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. boy, is his name gunderson or no-funderson?"
38168,Sheldon,thank you. i’ve also sent amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
39389,Sheldon,"oh, yes, born alone, die alone. it’s a tragic human condition. now, raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good i’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken."
44401,Sheldon,three giant red ones and they never blink. it’s unsettling.
45814,Sheldon,can you tell me the specials this evening?
38484,Sheldon,penny.
42245,Sheldon,hello.
44137,Sheldon,"wonderful. i’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. if i knew what that meant, i might just do it."
44706,Sheldon,that must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. please understand that i think of you as more of a nanny.
35280,Sheldon,"well of course you don’t get it, i haven’t made it yet. you’d have to be psychic to get it, and there’s no such thing as psychic."
43723,Sheldon,do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?
36198,Sheldon,i’m not unhappy.
35122,Sheldon,my spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with penny. 
35374,Sheldon,"notify the editors of the oxford english dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two."
39642,Sheldon,"i’m not going to say i told you so, but we could have killed him."
41812,Sheldon,"oh, sunday’s the worst. everybody’s leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only t-shirts they have left are small and xxxxl."
41675,Sheldon,it probably won’t.
36040,Sheldon,well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. may i suggest it as the topic for your essay.
45199,Sheldon,"is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again? if you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. that works."
44488,Sheldon,i think it’s pretty obvious. they don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.
43144,Sheldon,will you please play the game? i can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
40208,Sheldon,he asked her during coitus.
36547,Sheldon,that could work.
35236,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord."
43920,Sheldon,"uh, stop selling it, kid. you won."
34991,Sheldon,"engineering. where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. hello, oompah-loompahs of science."
44006,Sheldon,"no, no, no, wait. i’m not done. allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of brenda lee’s i’m sorry played on the pan flute."
39159,Sheldon,"oh, congratulations."
41142,Sheldon,"ah, that’s my girl."
39504,Sheldon,"you clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! you make them apologize to amy and set things right. i am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle bunny!"
43676,Sheldon,"he has glasses and i’m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison."
45070,Sheldon,"very well. you got married spur of the moment, i don’t see why your divorce should be any different."
42210,Sheldon,i’m okay. how was the funeral?
37497,Sheldon,"oh, lord, you just rang stan lee’s doorbell. at stan lee’s house. we’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with stan lee."
45108,Sheldon,sad.
39938,Sheldon,"fine, but if i come out of this looking like a dork, it’s on you. "
45692,Sheldon,"the prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart…"
39219,Sheldon,you can’t quit. that’s a court-martial offence. that’s punishable by… you can’t quit.
34515,Sheldon,i need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
39681,Sheldon,excuse me. i don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. you’d be lucky to land a fella like me.
39128,Sheldon,could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
34668,Sheldon,"let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, general so’s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. do you see the problem?"
35774,Sheldon,oh! hello.
38153,Sheldon,"good night.  leonard, leonard, leonard,"
43440,Sheldon,"wait a minute. i know this may sound far fetched, but i’m on the market now. you know, if i dated mandy, that would teach both leonard and amy a lesson."
44686,Sheldon,"do you know that when i get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like i’m a piece of meat?"
45425,Sheldon,where’s howard?
36289,Sheldon,"so, penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock  or i punch you in the throat rule."
45212,Sheldon,a little.
37285,Sheldon,i do tonight. it’s scary over there.
34377,Sheldon,"i’m a rogue knight elf, don’t you people read character descriptions? wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”"
39898,Sheldon,"well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. as you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. with that in mind, i propose the following. i will take rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that."
41871,Sheldon,trick question. there never was one.
39593,Sheldon,"i present to you the relationship agreement. a binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of sheldon lee cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and amy farrah fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend."
41446,Sheldon,i’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me.
35030,Sheldon,and of course it’s gravity probe b.
36598,Sheldon,is that a yes or a no on the freezer? the woman has the attention span of a gnat.
38178,Sheldon,so we’d be perpetrating a ruse?
44871,Sheldon,perhaps i will. this rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. i will cast you far away. feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.
39831,Sheldon,bleeding from my ears.
40423,Sheldon,"hold that thought! professor hawking has made a move. boy, oh, boy. oh, it’s only a matter of time before we’re coming up with fun nicknames for each other. i’ll be coop. he’ll be wheels. if he’s okay with that. "
36436,Sheldon,"once again, defeated by your own prurient interests."
34794,Sheldon,"as i have explained repeatedly, unlike you, i don’t need validation from lesser minds. no offence. "
41770,Sheldon,"come on, take me to work with you."
40095,Sheldon,"he will, he’s really smart."
43526,Sheldon,what is that awful smell?
36081,Sheldon,"well, it’s not exactly a plan but i think i’m going to pass out."
35267,Sheldon,"there are a number of options and, i’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice."
45522,Sheldon,"well, that’s wonderful. congratulations."
42903,Sheldon,my name is right on there with yours. that is a surefire mark of quality. that might as well say directed by joss whedon.
40669,Sheldon,santa?
42052,Sheldon,wolowitz?
43386,Sheldon,after all these years. i’m really happy for the two of you.
38554,Sheldon,is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
43397,Sheldon,is penny crying?
40724,Sheldon,"that’s a wise policy. i once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest. got a terrible case of pinkeye. but luckily, i was going as a zombie. i won second place."
39167,Sheldon,rotating.
37797,Sheldon,"all right, elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. the seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection."
40735,Sheldon,none of you will get it. it’s eisenhower.
44767,Sheldon,it’s khoo-vakh. 
43614,Sheldon,you don’t have to leave.
41359,Sheldon,"it is a marathon, not a sprint."
40807,Sheldon,i was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
37622,Sheldon,pacific daylight time!
41285,Sheldon,there are takeout containers in the trash can.
38038,Sheldon,a breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. she was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
36682,Sheldon,what are they doing here?
37111,Sheldon,bazinga. i don’t care.
35116,Sheldon,i disagree. your inability to successfully woo penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. that failure clearly stands on its own.
40898,Sheldon,"hello, i’m dr. sheldon cooper. welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. my apologies that this episode is coming late. i did shoot one last week, in honour of black history month, but i was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of george washington carver could be considered wildly racist. my heart goes out to the members of the african-american community, who, like me, have been kept down by the man. now, fun with flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it’s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. she’s had coitus many times. sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. once while he was trying to watch the incredibles. penny."
39200,Sheldon,"leonard, do you understand this?"
39295,Sheldon,what exactly do you mean by that?
41187,Sheldon,"you know, i have to say, penny, i don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging leonard to do this."
40006,Sheldon,all right.
44850,Sheldon,"you guys are aroused, right?"
41305,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. you find me finicky, pedantic and annoying."
37980,Sheldon,"what do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?"
40386,Sheldon,stop that.
36744,Sheldon, yes.
43086,Sheldon,"oh, i’d be incensed."
42454,Sheldon,"nice. you mean, like at parks and schools?"
38961,Sheldon,with what?
38218,Sheldon, leonard.
43655,Sheldon,"well, i never thought of it like that. boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won’t it?"
37894,Sheldon,she’s not my girlfriend.
45461,Sheldon,i’ve been thinking about our recent humiliation.
36785,Sheldon,"no, that would be incongruous, i was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register."
34981,Sheldon,i’ve decided you’re right. my career is not over. 
37835,Sheldon,"no, it’s not."
44445,Sheldon,did you see that? he just cut the line.
39937,Sheldon,"to paraphrase t.s. eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew."
45164,Sheldon,that’s wrong.
37252,Sheldon,"oh, is it? look at this. general tso’s chicken is no longer listed under specialties. it’s now under chicken."
40934,Sheldon,she is. but when do they get to the part about streetcars?
45647,Sheldon,"hello. nice work with the laser, by the way. looking out at your fresh young faces, i remember when i too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. of course, i was 14, and i’d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o’clock bedtime. now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it’s more likely that you’ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava."
36760,Sheldon,"what am i supposed to do, eat french toast on a monday? now, that would be impossible."
38329,Sheldon,hello.
41244,Sheldon,"plus, if i do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap."
39870,Sheldon,"oh, better than good."
35447,Sheldon,and you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
44967,Sheldon,"oh, don’t be. you were like a foxy tea kettle."
38574,Sheldon,playing the theremin.
40318,Sheldon,"there are some charts in the back where i kept track of shape, colour and consistency."
41481,Sheldon,"now give me that cookie, i discovered an element."
40820,Sheldon,where are you going?
44004,Sheldon,"my goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?"
34904,Sheldon,"no, that measuring cup has always been for urine."
38777,Sheldon,they went to catalina for the weekend.
42335,Sheldon,would you like to see pictures from my trip?
44757,Sheldon,"i have a feeling you’re still doing it. but i find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property."
35543,Sheldon,"he gets a new office, i can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?"
34417,Sheldon,but i thought you wanted to cancel?
35207,Sheldon,that’s not the secret knock. this is the secret knock. 
38167,Sheldon,exactly.
35275,Sheldon,it’s a common mistake.
39415,Sheldon,"oh, there it is. it always comes back to monkeys with you. just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys."
37441,Sheldon,"well, look who thinks he’s stuart’s uncle now."
35428,Sheldon,"oh mario. if only i could control everyone the way i control you. hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop."
41989,Sheldon,nothing.
35865,Sheldon,really? that’s where i was born!
39863,Sheldon,all right. i’m no stranger to a little gray matter. locus coeruleus. locus coeruleus.
36870,Sheldon,do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
39216,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?"
45413,Sheldon,now navajo.
41601,Sheldon,do we really have to go to mrs. wolowitz’s house?
41350,Sheldon,really? the only time i’m ever picked first for a team and i’m stuck with the liability?
35590,Sheldon,then i hereby invoke what i’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. the favour.
44000,Sheldon,"terrific. now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could i say no to that face?"
41319,Sheldon,i want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
45475,Sheldon,"howard, i’m trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else."
38619,Sheldon,"all right. we have seven people, and two cars. in the lead car, driven by leonard, will be myself, amy farrah fowler and penny."
41183,Sheldon,"leonard, you’re being selfish. we need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face."
37580,Sheldon,don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
38521,Sheldon,we’re the justice league of america. there’s only one thing we can do. turn around and slowly walk away.
38501,Sheldon,"oh, i hardly think so. the real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late."
34736,Sheldon,"it was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips. "
37739,Sheldon,i didn’t want to upset you. howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
42562,Sheldon,my struggle is emotional.
40645,Sheldon,i open the chest.
40307,Sheldon,leonard? maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls.
38349,Sheldon,"hello, all."
40582,Sheldon,you know what they say? revenge is a dish best served nude.
35881,Sheldon,"i’m afraid i can’t allow that. pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a, you are deemed unfit and i hereby relieve you of your command."
40561,Sheldon,"well, i’m not giving it away. "
39918,Sheldon,"why is there a hole in my new office? i’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities: there was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out."
38338,Sheldon,that’s not how it looks in the picture.
40367,Sheldon,"come on, leonard, i am spoon-feeding this to you."
38624,Sheldon,indeed. nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.
42487,Sheldon,thinking caps on.
44436,Sheldon,"oh, well, that’s laying it on a little thick."
42869,Sheldon,he is getting a lot of work done. he had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.
44287,Sheldon,"i hardly think so. you be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars."
38553,Sheldon,i see. is that decision open for discussion?
40227,Sheldon,strongly pro.
34594,Sheldon,neeeeeooooowwwwww!
37563,Sheldon,and i appreciate the pretence.
41654,Sheldon,really?
44019,Sheldon,"point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? because if not…"
40739,Sheldon,nope. the only thing left to do now is assign blame.  nice going.
39813,Sheldon,no.
36386,Sheldon,"true, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again."
42635,Sheldon,"oh, tesla."
39297,Sheldon,not for you!
34662,Sheldon,i’m sheldon.
35904,Sheldon,i’m helping you with stephanie.
39090,Sheldon,knight to old woman six-and-a-third. brilliant move. thank you.  will the two of you excuse me?
45110,Sheldon,"and you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future. what, now, see, now it says you’re mad. make up your mind."
34891,Sheldon,"i don’t need you to guess, i need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?"
35741,Sheldon,"all right, pencils down! i have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. anybody got those?"
43932,Sheldon,"it wasn’t difficult. you know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?"
41534,Sheldon, arthur. door knocker. that’s tv money.
43387,Sheldon,now get out of my spot.
35563,Sheldon,"that’s northwest texas, i’m from east texas, the gulf region, home to many vietnamese shrimpers."
42366,Sheldon,"oh, howard. i appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. i don’t think you’d understand a single thing i was talking about."
35480,Sheldon,"i realise that dr gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. university policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes."
34721,Sheldon,sorry i’m late.
40548,Sheldon,"i don’t want another parking space. i want my parking space. it’s perfect. it’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. it’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. the nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks."
36980,Sheldon,yes.
40362,Sheldon,it’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
35822,Sheldon,is there some problem?
42246,Sheldon,i just got called into president siebert’s office. the university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. they’re forcing me to continue with string theory.
45674,Sheldon,behind you.
42634,Sheldon,"of course there is. the mini cooper, ’cause it’s me."
40952,Sheldon,how do i get 12-year-old girls excited.
35903,Sheldon,i have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
35940,Sheldon,really? i have never once been invited to have cereal with mrs. vartabedian.
35589,Sheldon,penny. didn’t you recently state that you and i are friends?
35391,Sheldon,"well, why should i leave, this is my apartment too."
39180,Sheldon,boilerplate stuff. a modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. and a living will and durable power of attorney.
41554,Sheldon,"well, first, i think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing. "
36202,Sheldon,"hello, fastest man alive. want to see me read your entire comic book? want to see it again? something’s wrong."
45169,Sheldon,"well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. i’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before amy comes home."
45685,Sheldon,i would hardly call that dialogue!
35523,Sheldon,hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
40179,Sheldon,"and how do you propose to do that? uh, hope you’re not thinking about some sort of lsd thought control. because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that’s called school."
37745,Sheldon,it’s all right. i’ll see it again with you.
36408,Sheldon,may i interject something here?
40489,Sheldon,"wow, amy’s mad and leonard was right. what a weird day."
38687,Sheldon,yes. i didn’t care for it.
41383,Sheldon,"story problem? you, oh, amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. raiders of the lost ark is the love child of steven spielberg and george lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. i’ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which i can only watch when it’s still light out, but, i defy you to find a story problem. here’s my jaw, drop it."
34855,Sheldon,"no, of course not, there’s no cousin leo, there’s no intervention, focus leonard."
40880,Sheldon,but she’s got google maps on her phone.
41627,Sheldon,"now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?"
34371,Sheldon,"right, then the entire thing’s one big heat sink."
36151,Sheldon,"that’s your badge of honour, your warrior’s wound, if you will. i was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you."
36404,Sheldon,did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
35259,Sheldon,a second what? pair of underwear? 
42920,Sheldon,we’re just standing behind her. it’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her.
36754,Sheldon,"it’s an ical download, she can put it right in her phone. and i thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment."
40742,Sheldon,maybe we’re better off. what if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
40621,Sheldon,fine. then i’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
34776,Sheldon,i couldn’t poop this morning. 
37639,Sheldon,the part where i tell you i’ve engineered a rematch with stuart’s team for tonight.
39768,Sheldon,"yeah, they have to, i’m a biter."
39855,Sheldon,366… 367…
44154,Sheldon,is there a reason i had to leave my own apartment?
43897,Sheldon,why are we saying give it to you like that?
43989,Sheldon,"you know, i liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship."
40784,Sheldon,"no, look."
41181,Sheldon,"fine, no more drowning talk. i’ll change the subject. oh. who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?"
36841,Sheldon,"no, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target."
43002,Sheldon,that’s it?
38181,Sheldon,of course. would you like to join me for chinese food?
34242,Sheldon,"in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. in the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. it faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, i could go on, but i think i’ve made my point. "
41567,Sheldon,"that seems like a reasonable request. although so did, hey, leonard, would you mind returning that dvd?"
44141,Sheldon,what is it?
40347,Sheldon,notice people on your own time. we’re working.
43103,Sheldon,you should know i had nothing to do with that.
34261,Sheldon,point taken. it has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. 
35119,Sheldon,it’s still my turn.
42863,Sheldon,"boy, taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate."
41120,Sheldon,i’ll do it.
44958,Sheldon,we seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities. 
45349,Sheldon,science it is.
42027,Sheldon,"well, someone has to."
39754,Sheldon,"guten tag, das youtube. ich bin ein bavarian."
38319,Sheldon,"no, it’s a different leonard. he’s chinese, red hair, six fingers. good-bye."
40595,Sheldon,is anyone else troubled by the spider-man theme song?
45445,Sheldon,"comments from our behind the flags retrospective. get this, people are calling it the longest one yet."
41055,Sheldon,"anyway, thank you."
39156,Sheldon,"not quite accurate. the macy’s balloons are filled with helium, whereas leonard produces copious amounts of methane."
38036,Sheldon,amen to that.
43408,Sheldon,very well. you seem to be headed somewhere. may i walk with you?
35460,Sheldon,"it doesn’t matter, right now you’re looking for treasure."
44409,Sheldon,"oh, i overdid it myself last night. hair of the dog."
38699,Sheldon,"glory be to heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. george, put down that pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one, and get your shotgun!"
35976,Sheldon,"i told you before, bears are terrifying."
40302,Sheldon,thank you. coconut? what were you thinking? are you a hula girl?
45792,Sheldon,you seem tense. perhaps this will relax you.
41848,Sheldon,"well, you don’t like princess corncob, you don’t like fester, you’re just impossible to please."
45286,Sheldon,"oh, good grief. she is such a stickler for citing sources. those were amy’s words."
36278,Sheldon,don’t read those letters!
35069,Sheldon,who?
36097,Sheldon,"yes, but they have no icee machines. despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, i might add."
35179,Sheldon,not at all. frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation. 
43872,Sheldon,"well, so far, i’ve come up with three ideas. the first is a chance for her to play the harp with the l.a. philharmonic."
41098,Sheldon,"yeah, that, too. big cheque."
43177,Sheldon,"i can see the ranch, leonard. oh, it’s rustic, it’s lovely. i’d take a picture, but people are chasing me. i’m gonna make it. i’m gonna make it. they have tasers, but they wouldn’t dare use… aaaaaaagh!"
35936,Sheldon,i heard you ask it over and over. how is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
38255,Sheldon,and if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
39835,Sheldon,and no more singing.
36708,Sheldon,i don’t see anything.
44822,Sheldon,"oh, just let me look. oh, my goodness. i see quivering black lines. those must be neurons, oh, they’re so thick and beautiful."
39662,Sheldon,"oh, i see why you’re confused. no, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. that’s all about yucky, squishy things."
36974,Sheldon,"i have a few questions. first, i notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?"
35745,Sheldon,onion rings?
37375,Sheldon,yes.
36718,Sheldon,"hang on. voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka oecanthus fultoni, which is latin for i’ll suck nothing. of course i’m joking because the latin for that is nihil exsorbibo."
43745,Sheldon,"people compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?"
43593,Sheldon,good to know? what’s that supposed to mean?
35809,Sheldon,"okay, first of all, that’s a comparison of quality, not intensity. secondly, star trek i is orders-of-magnitude worse than star trek v."
41541,Sheldon,"so, uh, what do you say?"
41841,Sheldon,okay. but i think it could have ended with the karaoke.
41786,Sheldon,what was i gonna do? two ins in a row? where’s my lemonade?
43647,Sheldon,i can’t find that quote on the internet. did you make that up?
43071,Sheldon,do you want me to withdraw my application?
39499,Sheldon,"counterproposal. i will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good amy."
44125,Sheldon,oh. i’ll just take one last sip. ah.
39812,Sheldon,no.
40120,Sheldon,or don quixote is a book about a donkey named hotay.
43563,Sheldon,"as the kids are saying today, talk to the hand."
38282,Sheldon,"no, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste."
35676,Sheldon,yes. apparently i’m getting a free dinner.
42907,Sheldon,does it smell like blueberries?
42669,Sheldon,i see. take me to leonard.
37279,Sheldon,sheldon. sheldon cooper.
35234,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no, she doesn’t want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender."
41535,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, did i wake you?"
38637,Sheldon,"dr. koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?"
39717,Sheldon,"after you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?"
34294,Sheldon,and you’re certainly not going to win a nobel prize.
40658,Sheldon,"yes. what, is there a problem?"
43572,Sheldon,"nah, i’ll do it tomorrow."
35780,Sheldon,your clothes?
40804,Sheldon,yes.
38652,Sheldon,do you realize that teaching is the first thing i’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in march of 1989?
41468,Sheldon,can’t talk. in the zone.
39794,Sheldon,"i will admit nothing of the sort. and now if you’ll excuse me, i have to call my dentist and see if i can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped."
34943,Sheldon,"please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
45775,Sheldon,this is my ticket to star wars….
40110,Sheldon,and you want me to return it for you?
37014,Sheldon,"they’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas."
44746,Sheldon,who haven’t learned their place yet.
34783,Sheldon,don’t you ever speak to me again. 
38651,Sheldon,no.
37061,Sheldon,yes. the charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.
43566,Sheldon,"no, i do. eventually you’ll want more space, and you’ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it’ll only be a couple of times a month, and then it’ll only be on special occasions, like when bernadette divorces wolowitz. or, or, or like when koothrappali’s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. or amy’s wedding, where she’s marrying someone better than me."
34833,Sheldon,i was not aware of that. 
39695,Sheldon,"oh, no! they sent the wrong spock! live long and suck it, zachary quinto."
36064,Sheldon,"hi rebecca, i’m your new friend, sheldon."
37364,Sheldon,one question.
40114,Sheldon,those are howard’s.
39388,Sheldon,"mom, you remember rajesh? rajesh, my mother."
39949,Sheldon,"mr. d’onofrio? it’s sheldon. they didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so i got you this. i don’t know if you can read his little t-shirt. it says, um, get well bear-y soon. trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. with that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors."
34458,Sheldon,"no, thank you. and thank you, ordinary person. hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes."
44789,Sheldon,"night. if we did continue living together, would it be here?"
45434,Sheldon,"bert, rebecca. i’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier."
39045,Sheldon,"if you’re referring to the beverage, you know i don’t drink. if you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, i have one."
45015,Sheldon,"well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out."
41520,Sheldon,"no. wait, i want to guess. don’t tell me."
36864,Sheldon,"yes, i’ve moved to a four-napkin system. lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. if you like, starting tomorrow, i’ll add a guest napkin, but i’m afraid there’s nothing i can do for you today.  good luck. that’s the face napkin."
43751,Sheldon,"golly, she sounds too good to be true."
34780,Sheldon,"of course you didn’t, he said little idea? "
36775,Sheldon,very good. chocolate?
44926,Sheldon,"well, no, i just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. as a kindness, i should probably take all the games."
36146,Sheldon,"congratulations. you may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.  "
44127,Sheldon,that’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus. where’s the bathroom?
38452,Sheldon,i reject it.
35388,Sheldon,"leonard, i am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an iq which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could i be?"
40411,Sheldon,"look at that, the problem solved itself."
34419,Sheldon,"so, how was your date?"
43294,Sheldon,i thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work.
42790,Sheldon,"oh, that’s true. i suppose it’s only fair we make compromises."
36565,Sheldon,"he didn’t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. tell me what my other option was."
39436,Sheldon,"yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled."
42482,Sheldon,did you see the lake house?
37653,Sheldon,"no, after you, as we are currently crushing you, wesley."
39325,Sheldon,fair enough. it’d give you the right to rule a replica of england.
40254,Sheldon,what are you doing here?
38899,Sheldon,"what kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man’s battle ostrich?"
40698,Sheldon,"now, there’s no need to get defensive. i’m not unsympathetic to your plight. my father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm texas day."
36762,Sheldon,"boy, that does smell good. too bad it’s monday."
35555,Sheldon,did you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
36607,Sheldon,adversity is to be expected. continue.
38778,Sheldon,"at home, forbidding it."
39939,Sheldon,nope. 
40580,Sheldon,"hey, sweet ride."
44683,Sheldon,yes.
40529,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know. i mean, statistically speaking, i’m sure you have something to worry about."
34425,Sheldon,"no, congratulations will have been in order. you know, i’m not going to enjoy this party."
41101,Sheldon,the third floor landing. the poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. it’s really you.
37464,Sheldon,howard?
40025,Sheldon,"howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?"
38755,Sheldon,what?
40930,Sheldon,"all right, let’s get this stupid play over with."
40914,Sheldon,"well, i was thinking about you helping me out last night  penny."
40924,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, more rules? where does it stop? can i want to go because i have to want to go?"
38364,Sheldon,"another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it’s already five o’clock. let’s go."
37413,Sheldon,hello.
42581,Sheldon,"so have these two, and they’re having dinner with us."
41747,Sheldon,will you please stop joking around? i’m trying to figure this out.
43862,Sheldon,"see, i, i had tickets to the star wars premiere that night, but professor proton came to me in a dream dressed as obi-wan kenobi and convinced me i should be with you."
34544,Sheldon,i don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky. 
41071,Sheldon,i take issue with the word compulsive.
43600,Sheldon,by challenging you to a duel.
34727,Sheldon,it’s a children’s story.
39706,Sheldon,"oh, of course. it’s right here in my hand."
34329,Sheldon,hang on.
36776,Sheldon,"actually, it turns out i can."
39005,Sheldon,i assure you i do.
40161,Sheldon,"jeepers, i’m drunk."
34212,Sheldon,"if the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip."
45784,Sheldon,penny. zucchini bread.
42070,Sheldon,"i don’t know. hey, look, a quarter."
39668,Sheldon,no. i think i’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
40447,Sheldon,it sucks to be you.
40558,Sheldon,"i’d love to help you out, but unfortunately , i’m using it."
40481,Sheldon,walked right out the door.
43044,Sheldon,"okay. that was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business."
41646,Sheldon,"that just happened to me. next time you’re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk ira flatow is."
44403,Sheldon,"using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. you slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. as you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. the end."
42066,Sheldon,a quarter.
36881,Sheldon,"from hell’s heart, i stab at thee."
44218,Sheldon,"ah. yeah, i had to get a little creative because the s, r and m keys on my laptop stopped working."
34687,Sheldon,"okay, assuming we could dance, which we can’t, there are three of us and two of them."
40072,Sheldon,"leonard, do you recall when i said that i was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the higgs boson particle, and you said, sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?"
45782,Sheldon,"oh, amy, you naughty vixen."
45457,Sheldon,"well, i don’t like it."
42204,Sheldon,that’s it? i thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here.
37280,Sheldon,may i come in?
39242,Sheldon,a good wife would go to the store.
36098,Sheldon,they have twizzlers instead of red vines. no amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
44613,Sheldon,"yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? i mean, she’s never even seen me unshaven."
45519,Sheldon,i’m confused. you’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me.
36218,Sheldon,"no. no, this isn’t right. our food always comes in szechuan palace containers."
43302,Sheldon,"oh, look at you, the little engineer that could."
36222,Sheldon,i still don’t like this cushion.
38948,Sheldon,"we did it! i said, we."
36826,Sheldon,"all right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space."
34641,Sheldon,well she could have said goodbye. 
37491,Sheldon,"i also now have three points on a driver’s licence i do not yet possess, and i was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because i refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals."
44283,Sheldon,you may need this more than i do.
43082,Sheldon,"well, that can’t be right."
21802,Sheldon,that depends.
36185,Sheldon,"because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. on three. one, two, three, go!"
36582,Sheldon,"i’ll admit that was a concern. but the fact is, i’ll need a support team. and the three of you are my first choice."
40217,Sheldon,i think the reverend hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.
39392,Sheldon,"i’m not going to get my pecan pie, am i?"
42169,Sheldon,hello. i didn’t expect you this evening.
38018,Sheldon,"she’s not my girlfriend. she’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva."
45239,Sheldon,"if i may speak for comic-con, we don’t want that either."
21807,Sheldon,"cathedra mea, regulae meae. that’s latin for my chair, my rules. now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics."
40261,Sheldon,"yuh-uh, one more question, if you’re going to replace wolowitz, i need to know a little more about you."
36234,Sheldon,"don’t say it like that, leonard, say it like: we’re taking the train!"
41382,Sheldon,"my apologies. i chose my words poorly. i should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. anyway, thank you for watching it. it’s one of my all-time favourites."
21810,Sheldon,and you have a vehicle?
43426,Sheldon,she broke up with me.
36828,Sheldon,"this is not the time for joking. we’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus."
41918,Sheldon,excuse me. i have to break up with my girlfriend.
45698,Sheldon,"i must confess i don’t understand you, president siebert. first you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. here we go again. if there’s simply no talking to me, why did you call? i’m sorry, someone’s on the other line. why don’t you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we’ll try again later. cooper-hofstadter residence. go for cooper."
35027,Sheldon,"and of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance."
41910,Sheldon,"so, when can we get rid of it?"
41358,Sheldon,it’s the comic book store.
43578,Sheldon,"ah, touché."
42660,Sheldon,"thank you. and while you’re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in nicaragua during monsoon season, i can practically guarantee your death."
40382,Sheldon,"hurry up, find him, find him."
43309,Sheldon,then who is?
37950,Sheldon,"but seriously, even if i disregard the uncle carl factor, at best i have 60 years left."
40834,Sheldon,um…
34830,Sheldon,then i suppose you could have agreed to go. 
38982,Sheldon,it’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that i don’t find repellent.
45046,Sheldon,"if you do that, i’ll win in eight moves. i’ll win in five moves. i’ll win in one move."
41856,Sheldon,vintage? be specific.
38975,Sheldon,have you learned anything?
41768,Sheldon,thank you.
39784,Sheldon,"you moved up one. my pen pal in somalia was kidnapped by pirates. so, uh, how are you?"
35931,Sheldon,"you initialed it. see? l.h., l.h., l.h."
45228,Sheldon,"no, absolutely not. you can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. that is a foolish expense, and i forbid it."
39621,Sheldon,"the smartest? all right, you know, i may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even i know that was a doozy. leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever."
41655,Sheldon,so no more interviews?
39317,Sheldon,"well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. i’m not sure what’s tripping you up."
40826,Sheldon,"one game of thrones collector’s edition longclaw sword. oh, leonard and i bought that together. that’s a bit of an ethical conundrum. eh, i’ll keep it."
35791,Sheldon,"oh, good. hi, mom. how are you? but, mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. and, and she touched my food. okay, yes, i took her clothes, but she started it. no, that’s not fair. why should i have to apologize? yeah, i really don’t think this is the kind of thing jesus concerns himself with. no, you’re right, i don’t really know what jesus thinks about. all right, good-bye. did you tell on me?"
41184,Sheldon,"oh, gee, i don’t know. my schedule’s a little busy."
45440,Sheldon,"i’d say she’s copying you again, but i’m getting tired of sitting in the hall."
43613,Sheldon,hello.
39704,Sheldon,we don’t know that. not to a certainty. all we know is that leonard is home.
40781,Sheldon,what do we have to lose?
36808,Sheldon,and you’re wrong about hinduism and cows.
37181,Sheldon,very well. shall we switch topics to isaac newton v. gottfried leibniz?
34769,Sheldon,"uh, just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly."
21858,Sheldon,"this is for a full-scale rocket, not a model."
45331,Sheldon,"that’s smart, because sheldon 1, amy 0."
36442,Sheldon,"then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section."
44755,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t mind, i’m very good at complaining. if it were an olympic sport, i’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then i’d take home the gold."
35379,Sheldon,"if we were, the food would be better."
43121,Sheldon,of course.
43594,Sheldon,"well, that’s unacceptable."
44013,Sheldon,the one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus.
38780,Sheldon,"actually, it’s the three of us."
45667,Sheldon,gentlemen.
35785,Sheldon,"well, then may i suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata."
45258,Sheldon,"nuts to that, i’m going to comic-con."
45778,Sheldon,popcorn’s on me.
41635,Sheldon,"president seibert, i don’t know why you’re yelling. you’re the one who made me go on the radio. i was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. whoa, that one’s worth a dollar."
44783,Sheldon,i’m open to the possibility.
37040,Sheldon,"oh, i think we’re going sufficiently fast. what’s that?"
41914,Sheldon,that’s not true.
34634,Sheldon,"yes, but whoever’s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh…. "
35546,Sheldon,"right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.  "
35702,Sheldon,i see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
38731,Sheldon,"okay, i see what’s happening."
39881,Sheldon,these shrimp are all the same size. there’s no the logical order to eat them in.
39755,Sheldon,und dis is sheldon cooper presents fun…
45563,Sheldon,"so, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment."
43026,Sheldon,this is kind of creepy.
44040,Sheldon,"uh, thank you. oh, meemaw got a new set of teeth. oh, but then she found her old ones. oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth."
40486,Sheldon,"you’ll appreciate this. leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. tell him you’re not mad at me. go ahead, set him straight."
45672,Sheldon,"hello, kripke. this classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of sheldon cooper. if you’d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to youtube. oh, and a hat tip to leonard hofstadter and raj koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise."
34290,Sheldon,you’re going to have to call her.
41559,Sheldon,"leonard, where are the skee-ball tickets?"
42111,Sheldon,a bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
36400,Sheldon,"did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?"
37376,Sheldon,of course.
38913,Sheldon,"i’ve never said these words before, but good job, howard!"
37694,Sheldon,"just making dinner conversation. go, team leonard!"
45284,Sheldon,"well, i had some of my best ideas in that room, and i’m sure you will, too."
37468,Sheldon,that’s just wrong.
38506,Sheldon,i understand why you’re upset.
35136,Sheldon,"how can you be late, i wasn’t expecting you at all. "
43072,Sheldon,"and in that future, are we on the same planet? because i’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work."
36339,Sheldon,what i want is irrelevant. this is penny’s decision. penny?
34846,Sheldon,to help you. 
39272,Sheldon,penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
37734,Sheldon,you may want to sit down.
40190,Sheldon,very well. can i ask you a question about women?
44197,Sheldon,"i’ll say it looks good. it’s in my proprietary font, shelvetica."
40064,Sheldon,"wait. it was me. i opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you."
42173,Sheldon,come in.
34193,Sheldon,"well, why don’t you just tell people you’re one of the seven dwarves. "
43916,Sheldon,"bye. oh, good news, gentlemen. amy’s at a conference this weekend, which means i’m available to be entertained, hmm. as today’s youth might put it, who wants to get their sheld-on?"
42187,Sheldon,i’m fine.
42484,Sheldon,"well, you didn’t suggest a beach house."
41070,Sheldon,"oh, quite sure.  that proves nothing."
40915,Sheldon,"yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and i found your suggestions extremely helpful."
36481,Sheldon,i left them in the bowl.
35574,Sheldon,"good morning, leonard."
35599,Sheldon,of course not.
41494,Sheldon,there’s nothing happy about it. i’m being given credit that i don’t deserve. 
36075,Sheldon,"coming, kripke. okay. harness seems to be secure. small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that’s to be expected. hey, this isn’t so bad. a bit like vertical swimming."
34435,Sheldon,"in my defence, i prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”"
36096,Sheldon,"right, these theatres have to be eliminated."
34427,Sheldon,"you know what’s interesting about caves, leonard?"
36515,Sheldon,sleepy kitty.
38419,Sheldon,that sounds rehearsed. we are not alone.
34999,Sheldon,did leonard tell you to say that? 
35671,Sheldon,i do eat dinner.
37741,Sheldon,"oh. well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving rem sleep was entirely unjustified?"
40522,Sheldon,"no, thank you."
43048,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord. oh, dear lord."
42603,Sheldon,"i’d like to discuss this party that amy and bernadette are throwing. since you and i are both reluctant to go, i think i’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it."
41493,Sheldon,"oh, great. now i’m worse than a fraud. i’m practically a biologist."
40610,Sheldon,you’re welcome. now let’s get this over with.
34724,Sheldon,"so, how’s koothrappali d…. oh my lord."
36415,Sheldon,"well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of anything can happen thursday."
41197,Sheldon,"well, i mean it. i’m really happy for you. and that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. cheers."
44801,Sheldon,yes.
37702,Sheldon,"all right, say hello to your mother for me."
42164,Sheldon,"for your information, i was asking her about the next star trek movie."
35643,Sheldon,"statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. i don’t want any hassles with the fuzz."
38362,Sheldon,"did leonard? i’m no expert, but i believe what we just heard from penny was sarcasm.  oh, good. i’m eight for 26 this month."
39745,Sheldon,"the flags of liechtenstein and haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 olympics. and thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of fascism."
21856,Sheldon,won’t work.
41137,Sheldon,"oh, please. every time the topic of change comes up, you throw zachary quinto in my face. i’m upset the mailman has a new haircut, zachary quinto. i’m upset that daylight saving time started, zachary quinto. i’m upset daylight saving time ended, zachary quinto. i’m saying this for the last time, zachary quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. so stop using him against me."
43249,Sheldon,"all right, then. you should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information."
43956,Sheldon,"perhaps i should explain. while working with koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and i named it after you."
43550,Sheldon,looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude problem.
42783,Sheldon,i don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.
42888,Sheldon,hmm.
36394,Sheldon,"it’s axiomatically atypical. up until recently, they did not know alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. they never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical is demonstrably fallacious."
35859,Sheldon,and you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.
37883,Sheldon,she’s not my girlfriend.
42383,Sheldon,i suppose that’s a fair request. there’s no reason we both can’t benefit from this experience.
40652,Sheldon,"ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. ba-da-bum."
43777,Sheldon,"i am. you know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, i printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation."
40427,Sheldon,"ooh, my friend stephen just played the word act for 18 points. that’s right, i call him stephen now, because i checked, and he was not okay with wheels."
35921,Sheldon,"well, you’re the doctor, but i am constantly hearing this annoying sound."
41160,Sheldon,thank you. would you go tell everyone else that? because they sure think otherwise.
39955,Sheldon,"no, i’m not all right. it’s been six days since i was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened."
35677,Sheldon,"oh, hello."
38199,Sheldon,do you like trains?
43725,Sheldon,"well, this is ridiculous. being upset about amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. if i want to resolve this situation, then i need to take action."
43284,Sheldon,"initiating rotation sequence. don’t look at me, initiate. what does red and yellow mean?"
43217,Sheldon,"well, of course we do. fort knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library."
38266,Sheldon,i think a more amusing violation of raj’s trust is when howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to americans on thanksgiving.
44031,Sheldon,"so, for all the times i’ve offended you and all the times that i’ll offend you in the future, i’m sorry."
42878,Sheldon,"and then she threw me out. me, her very own boyfriend. when all i’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in."
43811,Sheldon,"amy, i excel at many things, but getting over you wasn’t one of them. i think i need to just be your friend."
44610,Sheldon,why are you all smiling like crazy people?
42041,Sheldon,"yes. not sold separately. although the ps4 uses cool new gddr5 ram, while the xbox one is still using the conventional ddr3 memory."
34565,Sheldon,anime?
42686,Sheldon,and i’m not? it’s an earthquake. i knew it.
38274,Sheldon,guess.
44989,Sheldon,"it was. bernadette had her baby, i made it to wizarding world, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. hankius pankius."
42421,Sheldon,"if you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, i’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the u.s. constitution. and it may not be cool to say so, but i think that love affair is still pretty hot today."
42064,Sheldon,interesting.
41735,Sheldon,"i don’t know about you, but i’m very uncomfortable with all this."
39548,Sheldon,"oh, of course he is. she’s very interesting. did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?"
34950,Sheldon,i want grilled cheese. 
40412,Sheldon,what if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?
21799,Sheldon,are you asking me or telling me?
44523,Sheldon,"leonard, you and i have our ups and downs. but i have always considered you my family. even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. i don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. both of you. "
36334,Sheldon,wow.
38823,Sheldon,but change is a part of life.
42566,Sheldon,it’s too late for koothrappali. let’s go.
42009,Sheldon,that’s ridiculous. i am a grown man. i am a professional scientist. and i currently occupy the moral high ground.
45744,Sheldon,"hey, look. i won."
39481,Sheldon,"i have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep."
35949,Sheldon,"oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. last time i had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions."
35484,Sheldon,"god, no."
40092,Sheldon,it’s actually 01100111.
41462,Sheldon,"i couldn’t sleep because i kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. also, i had one heck of a bus nap. oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?"
35062,Sheldon,well it’s not what he said.
38478,Sheldon,was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? because you might have been watching nickelodeon.
37748,Sheldon,"thank you, penny."
21798,Sheldon,you said you’re a scientist. what is the sixth noble gas?
43894,Sheldon,"i thought i could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. if we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon."
35765,Sheldon,"look, penny, i wish i could be more lenient with you, but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group i have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else."
40777,Sheldon,fine.
34722,Sheldon,"nothing, i just really didn’t want to come. virgin diet cuba libre please."
43807,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sure you and leonard will be able to pull it off.  oh. it’s my friend amy. hello."
40380,Sheldon,"well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. pool, beer pong, wet t-shirt contests, they’re all out."
44902,Sheldon,how do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
42664,Sheldon,"no, but last year, at magic mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it."
41951,Sheldon,very well. how do you propose we move forward?
42479,Sheldon,"oh, very much so. listen to this. this is from two days ago. hi. hope you’re having a good day. who has time for this constant sexting?"
39968,Sheldon,roommate agreement? are you kidding? we are living in a world of chaos. roommate agreement.
35886,Sheldon,how can you be sure?
44813,Sheldon,"on a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off."
38707,Sheldon,"mommy, why are you crying? ‘cause i’m gonna miss you, shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me."
42738,Sheldon,"yeah, i appreciate the ride."
42705,Sheldon,"over the years here at fun with flags, we’ve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder."
45294,Sheldon,"beverley, you know i hold you in high esteem. can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?"
35306,Sheldon,do you speak klingon? 
34621,Sheldon,well i’m sure he’ll be fine. he has his hammer. 
34567,Sheldon,oh no! 
35004,Sheldon,"you know, it’s like the baseball movie, build it and they will come. "
40445,Sheldon,"fine. women, huh?"
45244,Sheldon,"i was talking about leonard. and if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?"
45089,Sheldon,"oh, that’s a paradox. i mean if you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said."
42347,Sheldon,thank you. i assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?
42077,Sheldon,do you think he’s right? am i wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
37182,Sheldon,"isn’t she brilliant, leonard? how i envy you."
44334,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know. theon greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off."
45736,Sheldon,i’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
42808,Sheldon,"well, what if you did it gradually?"
40800,Sheldon,"penny, all my life, i have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. but i’m working on it, you know? just recently, i had to put vaporub on amy’s chest. a year ago, that would have been unthinkable."
43864,Sheldon,it’s late. got to go. bye.
40127,Sheldon,"i did it. had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother."
38748,Sheldon,"given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!"
44395,Sheldon,"your name is bernatrix. you are a warrior queen. you’re strong, beautiful and tall."
40258,Sheldon,hmm. do you like raisinets?
35812,Sheldon,where?
38486,Sheldon,milk dud?
45558,Sheldon,i’m going to admonish you.
44080,Sheldon,well…
35159,Sheldon,what i’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what i now understand to be your thesis.
35471,Sheldon,that girl needs to get a life.
43178,Sheldon,do you think they’re gonna call the police?
44780,Sheldon,how could you lie to me?
37430,Sheldon,"well then, you leave me no alternative. from this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends."
40085,Sheldon,how about dolphins?
42546,Sheldon,"well, i pray when i’m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal."
41893,Sheldon,i can’t answer that without collecting additional data.
40703,Sheldon,"i needed advice about a woman. i would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle."
42674,Sheldon,that’s for the fire marshal to determine.
36753,Sheldon,"look, leonard, penny made french toast."
34944,Sheldon,"no, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats. "
39477,Sheldon,you’re leaving?
39421,Sheldon,okay.
36317,Sheldon,sarcasm. good-bye.
45098,Sheldon,"okay, now you’re just showing off."
38328,Sheldon,"oh, shut up."
43577,Sheldon,"and as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. it would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense."
41174,Sheldon,"yes, he does. he caters to my every whim."
45033,Sheldon,"hey, how’s life with your baby?"
36570,Sheldon,sarcasm?
43093,Sheldon,leonard? have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?
39581,Sheldon,you tramp.
42917,Sheldon,"you mess with the bull, you get the horns. i’m about to show this guy just how horny i can be."
42543,Sheldon,miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.
44950,Sheldon,"leonard, i would like us to stop fighting about our possessions."
35692,Sheldon,he did.
42938,Sheldon,"of course, that’s how you know it’s a good joke. it not only entertains, it informs."
36950,Sheldon,uh-oh! industrial accident.
43210,Sheldon,wonderful. i just finished hanging the lights.
36796,Sheldon,will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
39176,Sheldon,"wait. not yet. we still have to go over safety procedures. now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. in the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit."
38986,Sheldon,"interesting. a friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the sudan. it’s a lesson in context."
43153,Sheldon,"so it’s like the musical equivalent of russell’s paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself?"
44770,Sheldon,"hmm. you know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. like that spider-man action figure that used to be on your desk."
35525,Sheldon,if i had a million guesses i never would have gotten that.
39993,Sheldon,"no, leonard, go ahead and mock. like my daddy always said, shelly, women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom."
44516,Sheldon,"great, now i have to start all over."
38964,Sheldon,she was attempting to engage me in gossip.
37123,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, penny, i don’t think so."
40722,Sheldon,"yeah. now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, i’m gonna need you to take it for me. oh, and, uh, you’d better ace it, they’re pretty mad."
40199,Sheldon,"so, that’s how this works? i complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?"
37010,Sheldon,tubs are slippery.
40448,Sheldon,"leonard, wait. no. i listened to your dumb thing. leonard, come back. leonard, come back. leonard, come back."
36085,Sheldon,"maintaining five friendships promises to be a herculean task. so, i’m going to have to let one of you go."
39893,Sheldon,kripke?
38301,Sheldon,"oh, good. i was afraid you were going to fixate on that mars rover incident."
36220,Sheldon,what’s real? what isn’t? how can i know?
42780,Sheldon,"well, then, it’s settled?"
38927,Sheldon,this says beyonce bootylicious dance mix.
40231,Sheldon,"as i’ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature i would even consider being eaten by is the kraken, because the last words i would hear are “release the kraken.” that never gets old. “release the kraken!” oh, chills. besides, i’m having dinner with amy."
36447,Sheldon,"vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, zork. it’s the buggy beta version."
38629,Sheldon,i knew she wasn’t lead car material.
38519,Sheldon,"this is my moment, dag nab it!"
43666,Sheldon,i’m trying not to attract attention.
40449,Sheldon,"oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded."
40758,Sheldon,would it come with kung-fu grip?
44068,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t think i could do that."
38156,Sheldon,uh-huh.
35333,Sheldon,until i find a permanent place i will stay with friends. 
39240,Sheldon,thanks for letting me stay here while leonard skypes with his girlfriend.
41954,Sheldon,i’m glad because i would not have seen that coming.
34645,Sheldon,"well first, we don’t have house guests, frankly if i could afford the rent i’d ask you to leave. "
43843,Sheldon,"well, i’ll let you get back to your date."
43997,Sheldon,"leonard, get ready for an apology. and with the added twist of an m. night shyamalan movie, i’m going to mean it."
37459,Sheldon,"i am not guilty. i only have a learner’s permit, penny was the teacher. when the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so i went, went, went."
39085,Sheldon,that’s because it’s simple.
34989,Sheldon,alright.
45620,Sheldon,uh-uh-uh. 
38393,Sheldon,"look, a side door. come on, short round."
44797,Sheldon,"i need to see it. while i’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow."
39024,Sheldon,fine. i’m nothing if not adaptable.
41273,Sheldon,twelve hundred dollars. that’s my final offer.
36885,Sheldon,"so, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely larry and captain sweatpants. very well. they must be destroyed."
43189,Sheldon,i’ll take your word for it. i was too busy trying not to defecate.
42400,Sheldon,young’s modulus.
42538,Sheldon,"well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in home depot buckets. that last one is quite new, but i have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list."
36320,Sheldon,there are children in a sneaker factory in indonesia who outearn you.
41418,Sheldon,"well, i appreciate your concern, but i won’t be seeing any more of amy than i already do. i assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota."
44032,Sheldon,good. then i’ll be leaving now.
37840,Sheldon,i can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.
42563,Sheldon,"it’s dark matter. when i entered the field of string theory, i was a prodigy. i rose to a position of respect, and i assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. now here i am in my 30s, i’m back at square one. and, frankly, it’s frightening."
43933,Sheldon,"oh. i guess i’m a special boy. you know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a fudgsicle. which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light."
37162,Sheldon,i do not. but if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home i would request that you add this.
39804,Sheldon,"yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement."
39769,Sheldon,"wrong, sir. wrong. under section 37b of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. see? it’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”"
36604,Sheldon,"that feels like a bonus question. i’m going to stop here while i’m ahead, but i’ve had a great time."
45224,Sheldon,i’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf.
45518,Sheldon,"well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. you and i could spend more time on that."
40262,Sheldon,wolowitz went to mit. what’s your educational background?
37907,Sheldon,i’m sorry. do you have other plans?
38831,Sheldon,"yes, you must be present to win."
40320,Sheldon,"nice try. now, in 1964, dr. peter higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the higgs boson. now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he’s on the fast track to win a nobel prize."
43216,Sheldon,"wait, no. we haven’t picked a winner."
35287,Sheldon,i assumed you would. 
34223,Sheldon,not with commentary.
43081,Sheldon,i have mixed feelings about doing interviews. i like the part where i talk. i do not like the part where the other man talks.
40326,Sheldon,"you said it, not me."
34221,Sheldon,bye.
34949,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m hungry!"
34278,Sheldon,"leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a tv. "
42462,Sheldon,"because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through the list."
38549,Sheldon,does it? a happy accident.
41170,Sheldon,i kiss you back on the  lips as well. your turn.
38667,Sheldon,i’ll pay you 40 dollars.
41729,Sheldon,"leonard, do you think i’m funny?"
38006,Sheldon,it’s fun for ages eight to eighty. join us.
44441,Sheldon,"hello, everyone. oh, beverly, good to see you. i’d love to chat, but there’s a line that could start moving any minute, so let’s do this. amy? a proper apology requires three steps. step one, an admission of wrongdoing. amy, i was wrong. step two, a promise never to repeat said action. amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. amy, i hope you can forgive me. and i hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an uber waiting downstairs, and i don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver ganesh."
41859,Sheldon,"oh, i’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing."
36802,Sheldon,"forgive me, as you know, i’m no adept at reading facial cues, but i’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated."
37566,Sheldon,"okay, but don’t punch me."
38609,Sheldon,"as a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. now, let’s start fresh. howard, we’re going to need some tea."
41881,Sheldon,i get it.
44544,Sheldon,"all right, you were on jeopardy. allow me to alex trebek this and put it in the form of a question: who has been a complete waste of our time?"
38423,Sheldon,"what is the best number? by the way, there’s only one correct answer."
34796,Sheldon,"oh, please. i admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. but it was straight downhill from there. "
41381,Sheldon,that’s it? good”
35449,Sheldon,alright then.  
43710,Sheldon,"no. the texas rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. it was a happy ending. well, for my nine-fingered nana."
34791,Sheldon,"oh, i see, was the apple falling on newton’s head, was that just an anecdote?"
36736,Sheldon,"yes, yes, the disappointing sex. that’s an inexact parallel. you and leonard can always return to being friends, whereas i can never return to a state in which wolowitz has not bested me like mrs. riley’s chicken."
45005,Sheldon,"what? wh, where’s the judgment? wh, where’s the fire and brimstone? where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to hell and i say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? we’re already there."
38142,Sheldon,since we got home from the comic bookstore.
44326,Sheldon,"well, we’ll just see about that."
37272,Sheldon,"oh, how i wish i could."
41712,Sheldon,that’s it. the baby’s here. it’s a boy.
42959,Sheldon,the spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with barry kripke. that didn’t help at all.
44625,Sheldon,"of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical sheldons and amys. one pair that was neither dating nor living together. one pair that was dating but not living together. one pair that was living together but not dating. and then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. although, with that many sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done."
45773,Sheldon,no they make my earlobes sweat.
44704,Sheldon,"well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone."
42481,Sheldon,a hotel? did you see the shining?
35842,Sheldon,"penny, hello."
38710,Sheldon,well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. case closed.
44587,Sheldon,i want another one.
42723,Sheldon,hello.
43687,Sheldon,absolutely. but don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.
44681,Sheldon,"you know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, amy is just as challenging."
36687,Sheldon,i did.
42358,Sheldon,"yeah, well, of course i do. listen to it. it’s like an earful of melted caramel."
34994,Sheldon,"really, how does it work?"
44503,Sheldon,and turned their phones off.
39696,Sheldon,"mm. i want to build a road, but i need wood. do either of you fellows have wood?  i don’t understand the laughter. the object of settlers of catan is to build roads and settlements. to do so requires wood. now, i have sheep; i need wood. who has wood for my sheep?"
40564,Sheldon,give me back my parking space.
44624,Sheldon,oh. thank you.
37520,Sheldon,ow! you hit me! i’m bleeding!
36304,Sheldon,maybe i’d be better off with nancy.
21797,Sheldon,"i know what i said. i know what you said. i know what my mother said on march 5, 1992. what is the sixth noble gas?"
35728,Sheldon,"yes, i’m getting a free pizza. i’m on a roll."
42694,Sheldon,"i was not panicked, and i am not overly attached to leonard."
39307,Sheldon,let’s see what i’ll be washing that succotash down with. a pitcher of margaritas.
36109,Sheldon,hang on a moment.  here. take some. pay me back when you can.
38365,Sheldon,see? howard’s on my side.
40420,Sheldon,"friends! it’s words with friends! which stephen hawking and i officially are. now all i need is a bunk bed with a slide, i’ll have everything i’ve ever wanted since i was six years old."
37428,Sheldon,that’s a somewhat ambiguous response. am i going or not?
38072,Sheldon,i’ll go as high as 40.
38811,Sheldon,wonder what she’s exasperated about. hello?
40058,Sheldon,nothing. i said nothing.
35125,Sheldon,"what’s the number, i’ll match it. "
37999,Sheldon,"all right, i’m ready for my next question."
42745,Sheldon,i’m going to buy her a present.
38321,Sheldon,i’m quite familiar with dr. tyson. he’s responsible for the demotion of pluto from planetary status. i liked pluto. ergo i do not like you.
42275,Sheldon,what happened?
35124,Sheldon,dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war. 
37904,Sheldon,"actually, i’m paraphrasing. having been raised in a christian household, i’m uncomfortable with the language he used. and to be honest, i’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie."
36463,Sheldon,"that’s preposterous. i do not resemble c3po. don’t get me wrong, i’m flattered, i just don’t see it."
34587,Sheldon,good luck. 
39865,Sheldon,no. what you see is a man trembling with confidence. does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
38855,Sheldon,it’s not amazing. all magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
39965,Sheldon,richard feynman played the bongos. i thought i’d give that a try.
40953,Sheldon,"this must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut."
35633,Sheldon,yes?
42737,Sheldon,"well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it."
38278,Sheldon,the capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.
36175,Sheldon,what are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
38318,Sheldon,"i don’t understand why you people are picking on my friend, howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. for instance, when i first met leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a north korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that."
40546,Sheldon,it doesn’t matter. that’s my spot.
34939,Sheldon,"well, my mom used to give me sponge baths. "
43752,Sheldon,someone will show.
34910,Sheldon,why? 
36105,Sheldon,"he went to the movies without me. it was the only option. i’m sorry, i don’t understand which social situation this is. could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?"
41102,Sheldon,"professor proton, it’s an honour to meet you."
44524,Sheldon,plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
41320,Sheldon,i wish i could believe you.
43673,Sheldon,"yeah, but what if it’s property of u.s. government? there’s a national helium reserve in amarillo, texas. if this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime."
36912,Sheldon,agreed. most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. a female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
36555,Sheldon,"oh, boy."
34915,Sheldon,i want soup.
34483,Sheldon,"yes, well i’m not a child, i’m a grown man capable of living my life as i see fit. and i certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother. "
39261,Sheldon,"for your safety, please wait in my apartment as i call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death."
36243,Sheldon,that’s over the wheelbase. are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 pullman-built superliner deluxe passenger coach?
42120,Sheldon,"apparently, i called stephen hawking last night."
44756,Sheldon,"is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?"
41328,Sheldon,"careful, amy. the friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy. "
38572,Sheldon,"ah, a combination of all your names. very clever. i assume koothranardowitz was taken?"
41086,Sheldon,"hello. uh, is this the bruce miller who wrote the season finale of alphas? oh, smashing. yeah, you already sound nicer than the last bruce miller who suggested i have sexual relations with myself. now, down to business. um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? uh-huh. mm-hmm. i see. well, that all stinks. no wonder you got cancelled. bye."
38027,Sheldon,i brought amy here to show her some of the work i’m doing.
43941,Sheldon,it is kind of cute.
36773,Sheldon,thank you. chocolate?
39429,Sheldon,does this mean you’re not going to sing soft kitty?
38657,Sheldon,acting lessons. interesting. it might help if i could act as though i care about my students and whether or not they learn.
40283,Sheldon,that is literally the stupidest thing i’ve ever heard.
42071,Sheldon,meh.
39212,Sheldon,"subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?"
34792,Sheldon,"no, no that’s true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple. "
44901,Sheldon,"thanks, leonard, now he’s not gonna think i’m cool."
44943,Sheldon,"anyway, i’ll leave you be. i have to, oh, oh, he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. apparently, they still make them."
38558,Sheldon,really? why?
41666,Sheldon,"i have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so i agree."
45045,Sheldon,"at our age, why don’t we call it man’s night?"
42181,Sheldon,"hmm. yes. look at him, amy. it’s such a shame. struck down in the prime of my life."
36861,Sheldon,"june 30th, 2004. opening day of spider-man 2 at the amc pasadena. they only had red icees, no blue."
43239,Sheldon,"i don’t recommend it. you’ll be doing it the rest of your life. anyway, if you’re looking for leonard, he’s with koothrappali."
44959,Sheldon,i didn’t put on my come-hither plaid pj’s for nothing.
37501,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you where i’ve been. you boys may have had gelato with stan lee and gotten autographed comics, but i saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order."
42465,Sheldon,"i know that if i had a wife or a fiancée, i’d ask her first before i invested money in a comic book store."
44736,Sheldon,do you know what else i love about you?
39492,Sheldon,"point of order. as you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. but i’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. how do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?"
41744,Sheldon,kumquat?
39218,Sheldon,"give it a second to load. whenever you’re ready, at&t! okay, here we go. this is us here. to the south is professor loomis and the geology department. according to their twitter feed, they’re out of sunblock, which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. that’s our edge. all we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. all right, let’s move out."
44674,Sheldon,will you two please inform amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
35492,Sheldon,"danger, danger."
42951,Sheldon,why would she do this to me?
40950,Sheldon,"some people are otters, some people are rocks."
38455,Sheldon,hello.
42332,Sheldon,"indeed. i was the world’s smartest caterpillar. and then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, i’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly."
41425,Sheldon,"last week, you told leonard he couldn’t wear his wookie jacket out in public."
44178,Sheldon,"thank you. that, that was wonderful."
38137,Sheldon,leonard? are you sleeping?
44173,Sheldon,"that’s how you do it, wolowitz. now you see why he’s famous and you’re not."
37772,Sheldon,"a word of warning. my guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber."
34968,Sheldon,leonard.
42191,Sheldon,"howard, i think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it."
45520,Sheldon,"well, a lot, it’s very annoying. has something changed? um, is there something that you’re not telling me?"
34677,Sheldon,no.
43119,Sheldon,"hi. hello. oh, and a special hello to leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name."
44232,Sheldon,"yeah? oh, well, was this guy rick from computer solutions on colorado?"
39068,Sheldon,nine.
41736,Sheldon,i’ve never seen this show before and now i’m starting with episode 246? it’s unnatural.
44311,Sheldon,i’m calling it. i won.
37537,Sheldon,excellent choice.
39723,Sheldon,"we were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and i was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, i’d be obligated to do so."
43677,Sheldon,you’re taking advantage of us? we clarified nomenclature together.
36625,Sheldon,"leonard, you may be right. it appears that penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion."
37981,Sheldon,why are you doing that?
41636,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins."
39912,Sheldon,"ah, the spoils. i see why victors love them."
36903,Sheldon,"well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. on the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-present danger."
38324,Sheldon,"yes, but before you get upset, i want you to know i went to the fbi and retracted my statement."
34912,Sheldon,"well, as i predicted, i am sick. my fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and i am producing sputum at an alarming rate. "
44288,Sheldon,are you trying to manipulate me?
35390,Sheldon,you mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
42772,Sheldon,"fine. now that we’re not playing, you can be green."
45148,Sheldon,"congratulations. the bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at the nevada northern railway. you are at the throttle. you are the engineer. you are running the locomotive. this doesn’t happen very often, but here comes a hug. oh, dear, i have to tinkle again."
41278,Sheldon,"are you sure? with your italian pizza and my chinese noodles, we could play marco polo. i mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of marco polo the venetian explorer, not marco polo the terrifying water sport."
45200,Sheldon,"well, wait. this is our first fight as a couple who live together."
36173,Sheldon,i feel very comfortable around you.
35397,Sheldon,no popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.
36677,Sheldon,plateful.
37132,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. now, introduction to physics. what is physics? physics comes from the ancient greek word physika. it’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. physika means the science of natural things. and it is there, in ancient greece, that our story begins."
40672,Sheldon,"oh, i hope it’s a train."
41743,Sheldon,excellent.
38595,Sheldon,a disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
37951,Sheldon,60 only takes me to here. i need to get to here.
43635,Sheldon,how many questions are too many questions?
39248,Sheldon,you take it easy! i need to use your shower.
43670,Sheldon,uh-oh.
41357,Sheldon,"well, i hope you’re wrong. i really want to go to the train store."
36851,Sheldon,"nevertheless, i didn’t say it. anyway, i would like you to come back and work for me."
38359,Sheldon,"that’s the work of noted hollywood costume designer deborah nadoolman. she also designed the iconic red and black jacket in michael jackson’s thriller video, which i’ve never viewed in its entirety, as i find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. and also, it’s really scary."
35816,Sheldon,"oh, how nice. maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison."
37017,Sheldon,"well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse."
45703,Sheldon,would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? and the answer was elephant!
36992,Sheldon,go apologize to penny.
36817,Sheldon,"yes, please.  how may i help you?"
42706,Sheldon,like when you do a two-hour fourth of july spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded.
35648,Sheldon,thank you.
43130,Sheldon,"oh, well, apparently leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. yeah, well, i don’t know about you, but i support our boys overseas."
35187,Sheldon,really?
41023,Sheldon,the tragic history of slavery in america. fun for the whole family.
42359,Sheldon,"it is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. feynman, einstein, professor x. humorously, in the case of professor x, some of his students actually had wings. that’s rich. i’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm."
42739,Sheldon,"because in the last ten minutes, santa came to town, kissed mommy and ran grandma over with a reindeer. i had a drunk uncle who did all those things. nobody sings songs about him."
42734,Sheldon,"yes, but she’s the only monster at the firm. between you, me and the wall, i think she’s an affirmative action hire."
43275,Sheldon,"at the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. it’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye."
41524,Sheldon,"that’s strange. that he would come to you for that and not me. oh, i got two emails from him. do you have leonard’s email address? and. never mind, i found it. i can’t believe he picked you over me."
37935,Sheldon,you were right. this was a very productive evening. i saw a whole new side of amy farrah fowler tonight.
41749,Sheldon,who’s in the mood to laugh?
38116,Sheldon,yes.
39282,Sheldon,"oh, i’m not buying anything. they’re having a lecture. h-o gauge railroading. half the size of o-gauge, but twice the fun. very controversial topic."
38097,Sheldon,it’s actually british.
41444,Sheldon,what on earth are you talking about? my behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. maybe your friend gunderson needs to head over to ikea and assemble a sense of humour.
38765,Sheldon,"no, no. i’ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you."
35023,Sheldon,i will yield.
35444,Sheldon,"well, the american midwest was mostly settled by scandinavian and germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure…."
38513,Sheldon,yes. and make her wear the black wig. good luck.
45037,Sheldon,"it says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. and that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job. bernadette, you are doing a good job."
41979,Sheldon,"if you weren’t my friend, there’d be a hole in my life."
39094,Sheldon,i don’t know what colour lonely is.
35602,Sheldon,"euclid avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. but you have the conn. of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, i withdraw my previous objection. here’s a fun question. do you know what the most common street name is?"
37074,Sheldon,"excuse me, may i interject?"
36405,Sheldon,"good. see how it’s done, leonard?"
39466,Sheldon,"holy smoke, why didn’t i think of that? you’re a better man than i, howard wolowitz. you put ‘er there, you son of a gun!"
37788,Sheldon,"he’s an odd duck, isn’t he?"
41547,Sheldon,"no, i said you were teaching someone a lesson. now let’s go."
39476,Sheldon,"topic one. faster-than-light particles at cern, paradigm-shifting discovery or another swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? and converse."
35368,Sheldon,bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. if anything they would have said “huzzah!”
37018,Sheldon,but i could call you a cab or an ambulance.
36686,Sheldon,i’m not crazy. my mother had me tested.
43133,Sheldon,"she said my name first, that must kill you."
36083,Sheldon,d-d-d! that’s where i sit.
34288,Sheldon,leonard.
38494,Sheldon,"congratulations. zack, how would you like to be superman?"
41972,Sheldon,like when?
35303,Sheldon,"well, for one thing, she was french. for another, it was literature. "
43637,Sheldon,what’s he say?
39054,Sheldon,"no, of course not."
35522,Sheldon,i had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
37261,Sheldon,"oh god, oh god, oh, god! it’s all right. they didn’t take my comic books."
43132,Sheldon,i didn’t hog anything. unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.
45087,Sheldon,"so now you think you’re better than isaac newton? oh, no wonder women don’t like you."
42215,Sheldon,that’s nice.
39934,Sheldon,"when i first moved here i was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to mr. d’onofrio."
45500,Sheldon,"yeah, i’ll definitely live long enough. vitamin c."
45758,Sheldon,yes. open it and check.
45113,Sheldon,"no, wait, uh, hold on. oh, what, you are. aren’t you sweet?"
38152,Sheldon,i see. can i get back to you on that?
43538,Sheldon,"as my relationships with penny and amy are currently strained, i’m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement."
41020,Sheldon,"i’m not sure, it could go either way."
38838,Sheldon,"better. it has a gold crown. you see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged archimedes with coming up with the solution. because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. but, while bathing, archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose."
40278,Sheldon,i can’t tell you why i can’t tell you. so i guess there’s two things i can’t tell you.
34410,Sheldon,just do it.
36852,Sheldon,in this context for me could mean with me.
38591,Sheldon,do you make it with milk or water?
40764,Sheldon,that’s ridiculous. i am one of the great minds of our generation. i work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. i said stop looking at my cool train!
37669,Sheldon,"no, i suppose not."
36141,Sheldon,"they had a terrible time of it, leonard."
37823,Sheldon,i should’ve brought an umbrella.
45073,Sheldon,"you know what? if you’d like, i could whip up a quick relationship agreement. well, i’m at a spa, i might as well do something relaxing. "
35618,Sheldon,"can you drive me to pottery barn?  maybe if i turn off the night-light, i can keep the sheets."
43097,Sheldon,an article was just published in scientific american about our theory.
40339,Sheldon,two cherries?
45465,Sheldon,"the theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous."
37046,Sheldon,"no, it isn’t. but i suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup."
44732,Sheldon,"well, no, that’s not true. i mean, sometimes it’s koothrappali. but we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority."
34996,Sheldon,"now, i notice you’re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength."
39002,Sheldon,moot. rendered unimportant by recent events.
44293,Sheldon,once. the battery ran out on my phone. i had to wait for my ipad to turn on.
37690,Sheldon,which one picks last?
39570,Sheldon,penny. 
37928,Sheldon,i’m sorry. 16?
41254,Sheldon,"and it was literally the moment you walked out the door. but i see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. okay, here’s one i thought i’d take to the grave."
42871,Sheldon,"there you go, perfect."
36359,Sheldon,"not bad? it’s horrible. i mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it’ll happen to you."
39358,Sheldon,"oh, of course you would have to believe that. evil always thinks it’s doing right. excuse me, stormtrooper. these are the droids you’re looking for."
35279,Sheldon,"sorry, you diverted me. anyway, in 1935, erwin schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. "
34626,Sheldon,"you know, i apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha?"
41555,Sheldon,"second, um, i thought your paper was inspired. "
36578,Sheldon,…the invitation to join the arctic expedition.
39471,Sheldon,okay.
38784,Sheldon,"un momento. oh, for heaven’s sake, now you’re being deliberately stupid.  where are you going?"
43731,Sheldon,"yeah, i am indeed. i have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about amy, it is time that i find myself a new female companion."
35243,Sheldon,wo de ming zi shi sheldon. 
42382,Sheldon,"okay, now that everyone’s here, we can begin."
35435,Sheldon,only nine more months to comic-con.
43718,Sheldon,no. you went pfft. what does pfft mean?
35181,Sheldon,i have an alternate proposal. 
42023,Sheldon,then why are you doing it?
37743,Sheldon,"and now, as promised, the tangent. sheldon and the hell hound, or how i lost my hot dogs."
39276,Sheldon,"no. i dislike the sound of the harp. its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think i’m going to experience an episode from my past.  i’m sorry, mommy. don’t be mad at me. don’t do that!"
36215,Sheldon,more?
38211,Sheldon,everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
38698,Sheldon,"shelly! shelly, how many times have i told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? goodness, i’ll never understand that boy. but then again, i’m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things."
42521,Sheldon,i started doing it.
37087,Sheldon,"well, i suppose i could poison kripke."
35018,Sheldon,"no, don’t. "
42911,Sheldon,read another one.
40332,Sheldon,"flattery will not get you this job, ms. jenson."
41347,Sheldon,he is a born showman.
35790,Sheldon,who is it?
45631,Sheldon,hello penny. leonard just left.
43124,Sheldon,i don’t believe it matters what the topic is. what’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. it’s all about the execution.
44252,Sheldon,"just wait. you know what? actually, yes, thank you. welcome to my fortress of shame."
34520,Sheldon,"yes, but i was eleven."
35635,Sheldon,"just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? there’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure."
35647,Sheldon,what if a simulated van rear-ends me?
36830,Sheldon,top desk drawer.
37931,Sheldon,"based on the number of awkward encounters i’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…"
45266,Sheldon,"hi, uh, penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine."
35067,Sheldon,that’s your opinion.
42283,Sheldon,"you know what? i don’t always recognize sarcasm, but i do right now, and i don’t appreciate it. i’m sorry for your loss. but you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster."
41551,Sheldon,"if you’re hoping to get in touch with bill nye, i can’t help you. i’ve been informed that he’s now bill nye the restraining order guy."
40003,Sheldon,"all right, then, i have no choice but to go on to plan b."
42995,Sheldon,correct. you’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.
42094,Sheldon,"i know. as hard as this is, i have to move on. i can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. i have needs, too."
35934,Sheldon,it’s not a big deal. we have latex gloves.
39694,Sheldon,"permission granted, commander."
34837,Sheldon,"i was analysing our lie, and i believe we’re in danger of penny seeing through the ruse."
45329,Sheldon,"thank you, you are a good citizen. told you. go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. same thing’s gonna happen."
37296,Sheldon,"sheldon’s journal. security system in place. however, sleep continues to elude me. i’ve seen the underbelly of pasadena, this so-called city of roses, and it haunts me. ah, the injustice, i lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing donkey kong on my classic nintendo.  leonard and penny."
43483,Sheldon,"in leonard? oh, even the sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely."
42937,Sheldon,who cares? he stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke.
43143,Sheldon,"i’ll begin. uh, i can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us."
39398,Sheldon,"it was in my weekly e-mail blast. right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."
38857,Sheldon,"i do. you just happen to have caught me on a break. oh, let me see those cards."
42062,Sheldon,you know i only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.
39464,Sheldon,hi.
37996,Sheldon,"you have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement."
39174,Sheldon,"the hammurabic code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed."
42818,Sheldon,"oh, i will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science."
43921,Sheldon,"a doctor? well, i hope you’re not contagious. i’ve got a weekend in the telescope room i’ve been excited about for almost three minutes."
39296,Sheldon,to send a message. she is not for you.
34550,Sheldon,"yeah, the name always confused me anyway, soup plantation. you can’t grow soup. "
43467,Sheldon,"well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again."
40164,Sheldon,"chicken broth. it seemed culturally appropriate. also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when i moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years. so, as they say, two birds."
38533,Sheldon,"oh, is it? well let’s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time."
39733,Sheldon,vexillology is the study of flags.
38902,Sheldon,"three thousand hours. three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. it’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time."
42774,Sheldon,you know what you could make us do? ice-skating. the cold air will trigger leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a zamboni.
39928,Sheldon,it’s called scientific curiosity. now go get butter.
41949,Sheldon,hello.
44584,Sheldon,"oh, i’m fantastic, never been better. i had my first energy drink and i feel great. hey, you guys want to wrestle? we can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. nah, we’re not fat enough, or wearing diapers."
34909,Sheldon,on sunday? 
43793,Sheldon,i believe you. i’d believe you more if you threw a few apple jacks in here.
44061,Sheldon,"and i call her meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her."
42107,Sheldon,"you want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? you know, why don’t you break up with penny and start dating a brown bear?"
41583,Sheldon,i don’t know why that surprises you. i’m a grown man. as should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.
44608,Sheldon,the computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
37002,Sheldon,"sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. while my colleagues are off observing the leonid meteor shower, i have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. although my research is going well i do miss the warmth of human companionship. "
38872,Sheldon,yes. i’m using their cray supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
34532,Sheldon,you did this?
38084,Sheldon,correct.
40893,Sheldon,read it.
45449,Sheldon,so he’s using his money to attract a mate. is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract amy? or leonard using his power of grovelling to get penny?
45213,Sheldon,fine. two years ago i got my driver’s license.
44620,Sheldon,"you’re darn right, you wouldn’t. no matter where i am, this will always be my spot. like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom."
40943,Sheldon,exactly. it’s like asking the human torch to heat up your frozen burrito.
38033,Sheldon,i agree. i move our relationship terminate immediately.
39461,Sheldon,"great. tropicana, no pulp."
42598,Sheldon,all the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. that means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
45240,Sheldon,"no, but it’s honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship."
36121,Sheldon,of course. that’s how you move a conversation forward.
42895,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll take it back."
43671,Sheldon,"well, did you see this sticker?"
42718,Sheldon,"well, since you’re here, i’d like to get your opinion on something. in honour of black history month, i portrayed george washington carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. what do you think?  hi. my name is george."
35518,Sheldon,"oh, good, you got my note. penny, i’d like you to meet tom, uh, penny, this is tom, tom, may i present penny."
41116,Sheldon,"i wrote a fan letter to you when i was a child in texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. do you remember that?"
45126,Sheldon,"i wish i never tried that device. and i know i said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time i mean it."
36052,Sheldon,that’s insane on the face of it. come on.
39520,Sheldon,do you think it’s a date?
45768,Sheldon,hello.
37367,Sheldon,i don’t drive.
35197,Sheldon,"it was obviously effective, leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. perhaps if she’d also denied him christmas he’d be a little better at it. "
43883,Sheldon,"oh, no. not that. i, i understand the mechanics."
39509,Sheldon,"yes, cuddles. we cuddled. grow up, leonard."
42492,Sheldon,wait. i’m confused. why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?
35727,Sheldon,what a nice girl.
44385,Sheldon,melba toast?
34421,Sheldon,i’ve been thinking about time travel again.
43131,Sheldon,"hey, you already ruined thor, give it a rest."
35604,Sheldon,"oh, come on, it’s fun. ooh! another bump. okay. i’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one i said, okay? i’ll start. helium. now, you could say mercury. that would give me a y. ooh.  very clever, that’s a tough one. so i go ytterbium, which gets you back to m. so you go molybdenum, and i say magnesium, you say manganese, and  i say europium, and, and you’re left with mendelevium, and  there are no more m’s because i believe that meitnerium should still be called ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. do you wanna go again?"
41892,Sheldon,hmm. it never occurred to me to pick a favourite.
36899,Sheldon,i can’t.
41394,Sheldon,"april 13, a dark night, indeed."
34858,Sheldon,"for a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which i’m assuming is embarrassing, yes?"
36117,Sheldon,won’t it also be weird if i have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
34740,Sheldon,"luckily for you, she could have you beheaded."
35411,Sheldon,"it’s not hard. it’s simple. you can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with."
42782,Sheldon,"that’s easy for you to say. your chair’s not facing the lingerie section. boy, that’s a lot of panties."
45352,Sheldon,"excellent. excellent. and on a related point, you’re going down, punk."
43164,Sheldon,i want more than a picture. i want to go in.
43648,Sheldon,aren’t you just made of sugar.
44857,Sheldon,"well, aren’t you a peach."
41662,Sheldon,"that’s it, i’m down to seven friends."
40694,Sheldon,"alex, check my schedule. what does my afternoon look like?"
39373,Sheldon,"come on, buddy. let’s not waste another second on this loser. love your house."
36192,Sheldon,"my good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense."
42587,Sheldon,"leonard, i was wrong. heaven does exist. and it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in sherman oaks."
42007,Sheldon,"perhaps not. but it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of ethan allen’s finest sofas."
42568,Sheldon,his statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
44701,Sheldon,"we locked eyes, i ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it."
42988,Sheldon,"so, you can experiment on all the apes you want. but i want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly i’m the monster."
36633,Sheldon,not to worry. i hid it. bazinga! you’re in my spot.
38892,Sheldon,they took my battle ostrich.
38444,Sheldon,are you sure? you said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
36514,Sheldon,i suppose we can stay up and talk.
41238,Sheldon,allow me to comfort you. at least you’ve got your health.
35941,Sheldon,what could i possibly have done to offend mrs. vartabedian?
36609,Sheldon,i hadn’t thought of that. i guess we’re done here.
43320,Sheldon,"of course not. i love you. i’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say."
43836,Sheldon,"it’s about how she made my life better. consider the lyrics. i was living like half a man. then i couldn’t love, but now i can. more soul than i ever had. i love the way you soften my life.”"
37945,Sheldon,what i’m doing here is trying to determine when i’m going to die.
35277,Sheldon,"well, let’s see. we might consider schrodinger’s cat. "
40276,Sheldon,"thank you. i appreciate that. you’re good people, leonard. there’s something i need to tell you."
36301,Sheldon,what’s her name?
42369,Sheldon,"hmm. do you know how to integrate x squared times e to the minus x, without looking it up?"
42697,Sheldon,"i can’t send it back, i had it engraved. here lie the ashes of leonard hofstadter. he thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.”"
43665,Sheldon,"right this way, uncle harvey."
34790,Sheldon,"goodbye penny.  oooh, one of these days, pkshhhh!"
34361,Sheldon,"wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning.  i have a masters and two phd’s, i should not have to do this."
38560,Sheldon,"oh. good morning, shoemaker. i think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night."
35274,Sheldon,"draft. you see people hear the word year and they think duration. foot pound has the same problem, that’s a unit of work, not of weight."
35880,Sheldon,"you don’t see it, do you? we’re losing her."
35300,Sheldon,"i would prefer that you not, but i won’t go so far as to forbid it. "
40607,Sheldon,"me? no. no, i’m not that kind of doctor."
43704,Sheldon,"no offence, but this is pure 100% nimoy. because of your mother, you’re only 50%. which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away."
34560,Sheldon,"the thing is, we’re not…."
35394,Sheldon,"i’m a modern day napoleon exiled to the elba of the staircase because leonard, get this, has a date."
35343,Sheldon,i’ve never slept on an air mattress before. no lumbar support whatsoever. 
35623,Sheldon,"hold on, i have one condition."
39332,Sheldon,"take it, take it."
45136,Sheldon,yes. i don’t need an emotion machine. i am one.
36493,Sheldon,fine. i was spock. are you and leonard friends with benefits.
41591,Sheldon,"you know, it might be fun. you love hummus."
35626,Sheldon,and the comic book store.
34661,Sheldon,well there’s one beloved children’s book i’ll never read again.
21840,Sheldon,"oh, you did, did you? oh, drat! hoisted by my own spam filter."
38953,Sheldon,"forgive my language, but poppycock."
40666,Sheldon,"you can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. i get right up in santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old saint nick, we meet again. yeah, i believe the last time we spoke was in the baybrook mall in galveston, texas, when i was five years old, isn’t that right?"
37686,Sheldon,will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
39234,Sheldon,"priya has moved back to india to pursue her law career. instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby."
44760,Sheldon,"well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. and i can’t eat, i can’t sleep. and don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements."
43192,Sheldon,"it was. and even though we’re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. unlike my sense of smell, which hasn’t returned since the tasing. no, i got nothing."
43570,Sheldon,is that the prototype drive system for the high-g rover?
43829,Sheldon,"well, i shouldn’t be surprised. there’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness."
39263,Sheldon,"under my authority as a self-appointed member of the centres for disease control street team, these premises are condemned.  penny."
40060,Sheldon,"my problem is that i don’t want you to break leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. she shook it. we all saw her."
40010,Sheldon,"thanks. ooh, listen, i wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry."
34920,Sheldon,i need soup.
39996,Sheldon,you’re right. i’m smart as a whip. i should be able to figure this out.
37437,Sheldon,you don’t have to be mean. i’m sick.
36927,Sheldon,"oh, yes. canine football fans are a common sight in texas. cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. my sister found that out the hard way."
44435,Sheldon,did you make the apology as sincere as i would have?
44814,Sheldon,eating a whole altoid?
35591,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i didn’t realize i was interrupting your morning prayers. when you’re done, we’ll go."
44607,Sheldon,"he said start with it, not end with it."
37447,Sheldon,because most of the things i’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.
21835,Sheldon,i’ll get to you later. what are you sitting on?
41990,Sheldon,i saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
37095,Sheldon,"the reaction will be triggered when kripke reaches the center of the room. mwah, ha, ha."
38674,Sheldon,you’re the teacher.
39264,Sheldon, amy.
38174,Sheldon,"i don’t know. you’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details."
36601,Sheldon,no. did she seem upset to you?
42509,Sheldon,"mmm, not bad. you know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. it’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue."
44806,Sheldon,"what, you’re familiar with the reference?"
42279,Sheldon,"your life? the university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. and now, the place i need to go when i’m sad is damp and smells funny."
34892,Sheldon,"friday, was that morning or afternoon? "
39108,Sheldon,i’m glad you think so. that’s what i strive to emulate.
43014,Sheldon,thank you.
38841,Sheldon,i’m unhappy.
42015,Sheldon,"howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. that woman needs to learn how to tie a robe."
40767,Sheldon,"yes, cocoa. do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying?"
39506,Sheldon,"did you know that when alexander graham bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? ahoy. i like it. amy? is that you? have you been drinking? i’m sorry, i bet my sweet what? well, all right. we’re on our way."
43094,Sheldon,"good, good. and your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. and i’m okay with that."
43847,Sheldon,and i will continue to do so!
38022,Sheldon,so?
39975,Sheldon,"at the end of the haircut, mr. d’onofrio would tell me a dirty joke."
41944,Sheldon,"yes, and hawkeye’s in the avengers, but no one ever says help, hawkeye."
38965,Sheldon,yes. i think prolonged exposure to penny has turned her into a bit of a gabby gertie.
43451,Sheldon,"yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. all you hear women say is, i’ll just have a salad. you know? where’s my lip gloss? i think this element should be called radium. that last one was madame curie."
44050,Sheldon,"it isn’t, meemaw. sorry, leonard."
44811,Sheldon,"al-ghazali was anti-aristotelian? boy, you think you know a guy."
45069,Sheldon,"never mind. you know, penny went to this spa to be away from you. are you sure you should be going there?"
40491,Sheldon,"i’ve been thinking about what happened, and i hope this gift will make things better."
37157,Sheldon,it’s a warm summer evening in ancient greece…
38048,Sheldon,"i was going to name him herman von helmholtz, but he’s so zazzy."
42646,Sheldon,"if the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. and if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone."
37911,Sheldon,sorry. i just don’t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
41876,Sheldon,come on.
37983,Sheldon,i am doing it.
43819,Sheldon,"well, i’m not everybody. i have an eidetic memory. i should be able to remember what song this is, but i can’t. something’s wrong with me."
36199,Sheldon,fine. the new issue of flash is out.
41946,Sheldon,"i wasn’t referring to this evening. ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that i looked like c-3po and pee-wee herman. and he called me c-3p-wee herman."
43167,Sheldon,"well, get over it. confidence is key in these situations."
38691,Sheldon,"it’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of east texas to the 23rd century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated."
44963,Sheldon,"it doesn’t matter what i want. it’s your birthday, you decide."
37200,Sheldon,agreed.
43351,Sheldon,"you’re right, you did kind of kill the mood."
34531,Sheldon,"are you insane? are you out of your mind? are you…. hey look, that fixes the problem i’ve been having. "
34729,Sheldon,that woman looks exactly like the pictures of princess punchali in the book. how often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
45007,Sheldon,"what, so you thought i was going to be alone for the rest of my life?"
45532,Sheldon,"no, it is. leonard pointed out to me that i’m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here’s some quality luggage."
44726,Sheldon,"so until amy’s apartment is fixed, she and i are living here together."
36646,Sheldon,you tampered with my experiment?
43926,Sheldon,hmm. what are you doing now?
37736,Sheldon,i’ve been seeing penny behind your back.
34270,Sheldon,i really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
41395,Sheldon,i’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
44199,Sheldon,excuse me. i’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. don’t need one now.
39023,Sheldon,"this is greek food? leonard, you hate greek food."
39215,Sheldon,"no, it’s not amy."
42058,Sheldon,"yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record the macneil/lehrer report. now i also was certain that hd dvd would win out over blu-ray."
34825,Sheldon,"you’re right, it can wait until morning. "
41998,Sheldon,"okay, let’s do this."
34713,Sheldon,"with certain obvious exceptions. suicide, for example. "
35726,Sheldon,"let’s see, today’s thursday. thursday nights, i eat pizza from giacomo’s. sausage, mushrooms, light olives."
35147,Sheldon,what just happened?
41692,Sheldon,"well, she’s due tomorrow. although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?"
44282,Sheldon,"well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return."
40398,Sheldon,i couldn’t agree more.
41108,Sheldon,"yeah, that’s great. did you bring your puppet?"
39201,Sheldon,talk to him.
44856,Sheldon,"some genius. i zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice."
35262,Sheldon,"not necessarily. i’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with leonard. just the other day i discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? i myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but i don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.  "
38264,Sheldon,"i believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?"
34246,Sheldon,that’s not true. koothrapali and wolowitz come over all the time. 
35995,Sheldon,did it when i was four. it’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.
39748,Sheldon,"all right, that’s it. who con, you’re out."
40625,Sheldon,"it pains me to say it, but i think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future."
34895,Sheldon,"thanks for your consideration, now please leave."
37407,Sheldon,"i’ve made you breakfast. juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. see, here’s frodo."
40193,Sheldon,"believe it or not, amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy."
37779,Sheldon,"no, she’s my guest. if anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. elizabeth, can i get you something? perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?"
42899,Sheldon,when i mixed it with sheldony goodness and cooked it in the easy-bake oven of my mind.
34885,Sheldon,"he’s a homeless drug addict, leonard, where is he going to go? boy, you have a lot to learn about lying."
36991,Sheldon,"oh, good, you’re home. i need you to do me a favour."
44131,Sheldon,"this video. the baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared."
45040,Sheldon,"leonard, i’ve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear? "
34386,Sheldon,"uh, let me ask you this. when i learn that i’m a robot, would i be bound by asimov’s three laws of robotics?"
36777,Sheldon,"there’s just no pleasing you, is there, leonard? you weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so i decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of thorndike and b.f. skinner. by this time next week, i believe i can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose."
44595,Sheldon,i do.
44531,Sheldon,"oh, what did he say?"
39994,Sheldon,"well, i took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist."
45371,Sheldon,"oh, i had an accident at work, i slipped and fell on my soup sack."
41977,Sheldon,i take it back. i’m scared of turbulence!
43493,Sheldon,would you pass the mustard?
37599,Sheldon,i’m getting dizzy.
37922,Sheldon,muggles.
35433,Sheldon,"i hope so, it was a snort of derision."
35457,Sheldon,"yes, but what does it stand for?"
40579,Sheldon,"oh, preposterous. i have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, i have changed the way we think about bose-einstein condensates, and i am also the one who got nutter butters in the cafeteria vending machine. maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. now, if you’ll excuse me, i have work to do."
37354,Sheldon,"don’t be absurd. that’s in washington. you know i could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. no. i’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."
45547,Sheldon,and every morning.
37443,Sheldon,"yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and i will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom."
37289,Sheldon,"listen to her, jim."
37880,Sheldon,"i wouldn’t say amazing. at best, it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us country bear jamboree."
36258,Sheldon,it’s brilliant. he needs to read it.
40520,Sheldon,i expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. gentlemen.
45677,Sheldon,"it’s actually not bad. but my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief powerpoint presentation. lights. why sheldon cooper, phd, should go to switzerland to see the cern supercollider. a powerpoint presentation by sheldon cooper, phd."
43573,Sheldon,"had me at flag, lost me at football."
39692,Sheldon,"as you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. but they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. so, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. i love my mind."
40982,Sheldon,"are you pointing out that california is a community property state, and since howard and bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?"
45206,Sheldon,"i’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. i call these circles zones of privacy. don’t google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals. this circle contains only me and you. it represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. although, as i’m saying it, i may need to add dr. fink in here."
38507,Sheldon,yes. you’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.
34484,Sheldon,"to my room, and no-one’s allowed in. "
43089,Sheldon,"well, i don’t know, we’re all groot? just tell me."
37585,Sheldon,says the former member of the corn queen’s court.
40036,Sheldon,not this time. then they wouldn’t be special. thanks penny.
41074,Sheldon,"oh, amy. and you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. especially since i’m about to win.  b-but we didn’t finish."
42267,Sheldon,"i have real problems here, amy. i can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. mmm, yummy."
38495,Sheldon,"excuse me, i believe aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere."
34479,Sheldon,"i know, but why?"
44459,Sheldon,"you know, right now, at the back of this line, there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn’t care. yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was rosa parks."
43365,Sheldon,"oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary."
41312,Sheldon,hello.
40911,Sheldon,all right.
38463,Sheldon,what are you suggesting?
39293,Sheldon,"leonard. check it out. i bought an n-gauge locomotive. half the size of h-o. look, it fits in my mouth."
35879,Sheldon,"yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike. who’s mike? why does he get a digital sheep and not you?"
35065,Sheldon,informal protest.
38258,Sheldon,"well, no-one’s going to run a dna test on it, leonard, honestly you over-think everything."
43764,Sheldon,"and just like that, you’re a klingon-sanskrit junkie."
44729,Sheldon,"hmm. you see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. help me out here, this is not where i shine."
37333,Sheldon,the same thing i’ve been doing for three days. trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
34395,Sheldon,"oh, come on, leonard! this is obviously about penny. "
38102,Sheldon,yes.
36632,Sheldon,"flash-frozen brown rice, not white?"
36707,Sheldon,"all right, you have a wager."
39112,Sheldon,"they sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones."
39205,Sheldon,"if i could, i would, but i can’t, so i shan’t. now, knowing penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. but, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we?  yes, just like that. penny could have been inspecting raj’s anal region for parasites. oh, boy. that’s a true blue friend."
44518,Sheldon,"well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. i mean, look at us. we took things remarkably slow. you and i, we didn’t even hold hands for two years."
42766,Sheldon,"that’s not true. any colour’s fine with me. yeah, i could be a-a combination of blue and yellow."
42565,Sheldon,good. because i am too hot and tired to go on about how much i hate voyager the tv show.
36069,Sheldon,"mmhmm. mmhmm. it’s interesting. but isn’t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? yeah? tell me another interest of yours. hmmm. is there any chance you like monkeys? what is wrong with you? everybody likes monkeys. hang on, kripke.  a loop counter? and an escape to the least objectionable activity! howard, that’s brilliant! i’m surprised you saw that."
41522,Sheldon,"but i’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. look how happy he is."
41596,Sheldon,"yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it."
39274,Sheldon,you mean like salt lake city?
39671,Sheldon,i’ll say.
44931,Sheldon,but you don’t even like flags.
35572,Sheldon,"uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. they could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and i’m not insane, my mother had me tested."
35202,Sheldon,"year after year, i had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation. "
39028,Sheldon,"a girls night? oh, i don’t know if i’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps."
45673,Sheldon,you might want to lock the door behind me. this isn’t bozeman.
42658,Sheldon,you know who else said that? every cocky t. rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.
35639,Sheldon,but i’m not done. i have many additional concerns about these questions.
38225,Sheldon,with or without a numbing agent?
43977,Sheldon,you stayed in michigan all week to avoid being around me?
44805,Sheldon,i’m just contemplating buridan’s donkey.
42060,Sheldon,"yeah, exactly. it’s an mp3 player brought to us by the makers of xbox."
42994,Sheldon,you ready to begin?
35758,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry, but that is your second strike."
38186,Sheldon,"agreed. amy, i find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. bazinga. bedtime. please show yourself out."
45824,Sheldon,…of ap calculus.
37539,Sheldon,i knew it. give us the precious!
36299,Sheldon,good for you. sign here.
35883,Sheldon,this is banana bread.
40093,Sheldon,"i’m not asking for me, i’m asking for hawking."
40080,Sheldon,then to avoid jewish hell?
45707,Sheldon,you’re welcome. please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. i’m trying to stream a movie on netflix in here.
44163,Sheldon,how do you know i’m not using the facilities?
38454,Sheldon,"oh. as they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how i could mistake them for my sashimi."
38031,Sheldon,"excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology."
44191,Sheldon,"great, so they own my idea for a t-shirt that says dumb as a bag of geologists."
40988,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll tell you. my goodness, everyone’s on their game today."
42502,Sheldon,"oh, i’m going with it. marty and doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. that means 2015 biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 biff. therefore, the timeline in which 1955 biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 biff never gets the almanac. and not just never gets. never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t."
40941,Sheldon,"i think that’s incredibly sexist of you. i believe in a gender-blind society like in star trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals."
39018,Sheldon,but…
44015,Sheldon,"raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. i hope that you can accept my apology."
44249,Sheldon,"no, i meant turn right, and you missed it. maybe you do need to know."
41842,Sheldon,oh. how much does it cost to get them off my lap?
39561,Sheldon,"cluck, cluck, cluck. what are we, ladies at a quilting bee? or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?"
44076,Sheldon,hello.
45702,Sheldon,help me! come back! penny!
44952,Sheldon,"i do. and to show you that there are no hard feelings, i am willing to rub my genitals on it as well."
34510,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?"
40700,Sheldon,"yeah, you and me both, sister. now, please understand, i don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce. but during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may i suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? let’s see here. oh, yes. check out this oozy doozy."
36034,Sheldon,hi.
41870,Sheldon,you’re right. that was insensitive of me. i have to go back to my table now. you should join us.
45424,Sheldon,"bert, you’re tying up the line. my apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments."
44809,Sheldon,really?
45700,Sheldon,who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting our brains? you really are an ass.
44554,Sheldon,they made me promise i wouldn’t talk.
37821,Sheldon,good what?
36536,Sheldon,at times.
44450,Sheldon,excuse me.
45819,Sheldon,it’s still six spots above steve jobs. i care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.
35560,Sheldon,i want you to check before you accept the order.
44023,Sheldon,"look at him, caring about what’s wrong with me. that is some top-shelf empathy. hey, well, we should start a club."
43993,Sheldon,"i have empathy. watch. leonard made me soup, and i was mean to him."
42588,Sheldon,"because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?"
21803,Sheldon,"no, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers."
43586,Sheldon,"uh, yes, i’m aware. but if i say i want to touch one of my friends, i’ll get called into human resources."
44714,Sheldon,"you expressed an interest in having people over, and i feel i dismissed it too quickly. so, i took matters into my own hands, and i arranged a brunch."
38095,Sheldon,why on earth are you telling me all this?
38326,Sheldon,"yes. i followed the social protocol. i attempted to right the wrong, and when i failed to do so i delivered a heartfelt apology. now you say apology accepted, and i will offer you a one-time-only high five."
40511,Sheldon,i’ll tell you. i’m from texas. need i say more?
34759,Sheldon,"because i have no interest in standing in the rose room of the pasadena marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. which, if i were there, it would be. "
45084,Sheldon,"that’s not a problem, we can figure this out. what are the reasons women reject raj?"
37543,Sheldon,"i won! this is astonishing. not that i won the award, no one deserves it more. actually, i guess i misspoke. it’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. i’m not sure what to do first. maybe i should call my mother. wait! i know, i’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online."
35072,Sheldon,alright that is very immature.
43393,Sheldon,"leonard, have you gotten married yet?"
37899,Sheldon,"if you’re looking for an example of a waste of time, i would refer you to the conversation we’re having right now."
38541,Sheldon,"all right. all right, i’m not going to argue with you. sheldon cooper is nothing if not a team player. dr. hofstadter, you have the conn."
34431,Sheldon,well here’s an interesting turn of events.
40100,Sheldon,"yes, yes. what did you decide?"
39971,Sheldon,"penny, you’re not trained. you’re not licensed. most importantly, you don’t have access to my haircut records."
41510,Sheldon,i can’t believe i read this table wrong. i blame you.
37518,Sheldon,i’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
38816,Sheldon,i’m setting out snacks.
38439,Sheldon,zack.
45370,Sheldon,"yeah, i felt the same way about the platypus. you know, bird and mammal in the same creature? no way. and spoiler, way."
39285,Sheldon,"okay, everybody calm down. there is a simple solution here. raj, take me to the train store, and then i don’t care what you people do."
40392,Sheldon,"for the record, he also thinks the walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world."
37186,Sheldon,i made tea.
41277,Sheldon,"oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. my uncle used to wear that. perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before leonard returns."
36369,Sheldon,"i knew it! ps3, definitely  ps3, who would pick a mountain bike?"
40951,Sheldon,"oh, hold on. while i’m comfortable speaking about science, i’m not sure i know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. better google it."
34243,Sheldon,well.
42607,Sheldon,"well, if it’s part of the prom experience, then i’m open to it."
40389,Sheldon,"so, with all those antioxidants, what if i run out of oxidants?"
40184,Sheldon,you know i don’t drink.
42114,Sheldon,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  empty room. if somebody says come in, i’m gonna freak out."
44864,Sheldon,"yeah, well i am angry. and you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. and do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?"
44889,Sheldon,sorry i’m moving slowly.
37624,Sheldon,these are my own bowling shoes.
40220,Sheldon,and the klingon high council…
45482,Sheldon,"what, are you crazy? i’m on a unicycle."
40947,Sheldon,how is it sexist? my character wields a battle axe as well as any man.
36119,Sheldon,"you know, i’ve given the matter some thought, and i think i’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens."
40415,Sheldon,i should’ve picked hickey.
35211,Sheldon,that’s because i didn’t bring one.
37016,Sheldon,i don’t drive.
45724,Sheldon,"oh, good, leonard, you’re here. science news. this will interest you. and, penny, feel free to paint your nails."
44130,Sheldon,"oh, wait, i found something."
37867,Sheldon,you’re bluffing.
43691,Sheldon,"this is a documentary about mr. spock. i’m sure if there’s nudity, it will be tasteful."
36000,Sheldon,"yeah, excuse me, penny, but in this room, you’re the one who’s peculiar."
35638,Sheldon,"how else are they going to learn? look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. the correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction."
44938,Sheldon,it’s a good thing you’re cute.
35746,Sheldon,extra breading?
42327,Sheldon,can i have one more moment with leonard?
38212,Sheldon,no. but it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. who was at the door?
42217,Sheldon,so?
37215,Sheldon,you’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. i am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
44754,Sheldon,"you know, if you’d like, i could call your landlord and complain."
43145,Sheldon,i don’t want to play anymore.
42170,Sheldon,"and how do you propose to do that?  unless you have gravity on blu-ray under that skirt, i don’t know where you’re going with this."
35317,Sheldon,"i.e, i couldn’t become green lantern unless i was chosen by the guardians of oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, i could be batman."
34309,Sheldon,"oh no, let’s assume that they can. lois lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. miss lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces. "
44786,Sheldon,but that’s my room.
44212,Sheldon,do you still like cilantro?
38407,Sheldon,"well, who would ever guess that?"
41685,Sheldon,"you know, i don’t just say smart things about science. i also yodel. "
38205,Sheldon,"hit troll with axe. hit troll with axe. hit troll with axe. oh my, this is one tough troll."
40272,Sheldon,"now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?"
39886,Sheldon,"dibs? this is a university, not a playground. offices are not assigned because someone called dibs."
37361,Sheldon,you didn’t really type.
35972,Sheldon,"no, it’s too late. i see it. that elf sticker says to sheldon. the die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, hannibal has crossed the alps."
45431,Sheldon,is she a geologist?
35988,Sheldon,"i should note i’m having some digestive distress, so, if i excuse myself abruptly, don’t be alarmed. oh, a napkin."
44317,Sheldon,"well, isn’t man-man just man?"
40762,Sheldon,"that’s a drawing of a really cool train. don’t look at that, either. what do you want?"
38169,Sheldon,she’ll get lost. we no longer live at 2311 los robles. we now live at 311 los robles.
38659,Sheldon,"you’re an  actress, correct?"
44982,Sheldon,five minutes? we must be doing it wrong. it took us hours.
38042,Sheldon,"now, if you’ll excuse me, i’m off to buy a pussycat."
38718,Sheldon,sheldon is not going.
44049,Sheldon,"no. oh, no. now you call her constance. i call her meemaw. you have your own meemaw. it’s not my fault she died when you were four."
40627,Sheldon,"oh, that seems overly harsh. i mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. you know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey."
34893,Sheldon,"think woman, who blew their nose and when? "
39756,Sheldon,flags.
35558,Sheldon,what took you so long?
44603,Sheldon,i can’t.
40241,Sheldon,i just had cobbler.
42301,Sheldon,"uh, i’m in kingman, arizona, and, uh, i need you to come pick me up."
40041,Sheldon,spock?
34627,Sheldon,oh good grief.
35015,Sheldon,well count me out.
41136,Sheldon,i’m not sure how i feel about howard being dungeon master instead of you.
45097,Sheldon,thank you.
44362,Sheldon,"i also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don’t remember."
36887,Sheldon,"i play my endless serpent. raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means larry will have to play chaos overlord, then captain sweatpants, molten river. i play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. now fetch me wil wheaton! bortas bir jablu’di’ reh qaqqu’ nay’"
40270,Sheldon,"string theory is complicated. that’s just yucky. don’t get any ideas. all right, for the sake of argument, let’s say that’s true. why doesn’t penny just end the relationship?"
35340,Sheldon,"i’m kidding, i packed it. it was a joke, i was subverting the conversational expectations. i believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo. "
35641,Sheldon,"is that why i appear to be in downtown fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored humvee?"
45797,Sheldon,i have an override switch.
35271,Sheldon,leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees? 
35888,Sheldon,"she’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. if i have any hope of keeping them together, i need data. specifically, i need to know exactly what leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks."
43896,Sheldon,yes. may i ask you a question before i give it to you?
40587,Sheldon,"oh, stop. and i believe this is yours. fyi, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground."
44626,Sheldon,"well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. i would like this experiment to go well. are there any insights you can share?"
35040,Sheldon,"oh neat, what’s the occasion?"
39843,Sheldon,"boy, oh, boy. this vacation is off to a wonderful start. the smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. mm, i can already feel my cares just melting away."
45361,Sheldon,"these are hydration backpacks. for efficiency, whenever i’m thirsty i have access to water. when i’m hungry, i have lentil soup."
37595,Sheldon,"so, i hear you saying you’re angry with your mother."
42444,Sheldon,"speaking of which, according to a recent study out of oxford university, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends."
38570,Sheldon,"monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. no? how about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? go, beavers. i’ll be back."
36413,Sheldon,this is thai food.
35431,Sheldon,"i’m listening, amuse me."
34805,Sheldon,"well that’s not much of an apology, but i’ll take it. "
45459,Sheldon,"i guess i just need to face it, i’m no longer a wunderkind. now i just wonder what’s for lunch."
40883,Sheldon,i think i’ll keep it for myself.
34485,Sheldon,morning.
38850,Sheldon,she’s also a bit of a know-it-all. mmm. this is good. whatever it is.
39951,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, i’m just here to get my hair cut."
34555,Sheldon,"you know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. "
35698,Sheldon,drat.
37630,Sheldon,"a common spare. the miss congeniality of the bowling pageant. before you jump on twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. i am the ball. my thoughts are its thoughts. its holes are my holes.  yes. tweet that, tweety bird."
37558,Sheldon,i do like the x-men.
42922,Sheldon,"yeah, i do. then no matter how he responds, i am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?"
37808,Sheldon,"elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!"
44368,Sheldon,"well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly."
42319,Sheldon,"at the hot dog stand in the denver train station, heinz ketchup. at the hot dog stand in the salt lake city train station, heinz ketchup. at the hot dog stand in the indianapolis train station?"
36890,Sheldon,fire demon.
38998,Sheldon,"i wish you hadn’t done that. that’s going to make me a chick magnet, and i’m so busy as it is."
44396,Sheldon,"i think you’re gonna like a lot of things i have in store. for example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs."
44892,Sheldon,"all right, let’s do this, bert? we need to talk."
42079,Sheldon,"no, that’s not it."
36884,Sheldon,silence! how much longer must i wait for my revenge?
37306,Sheldon,"our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, i’m leaving pasadena forever. tell me how that’s overreacting."
43251,Sheldon,"no, it’s the wise man. that’s why he’s called the wise man. you know how i know that? i’m the wise man."
38337,Sheldon,"you’ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. then ignite the rum, caramel…"
35105,Sheldon,it only moves in time. it would be worse than useless in a swamp. 
43433,Sheldon,"well, whatever it is, it agrees with you."
37083,Sheldon,did you laugh?
35399,Sheldon,what do they have?
39565,Sheldon,"really? you think i care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?"
35395,Sheldon,alone?
41958,Sheldon,"well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. penny, your check engine…"
45820,Sheldon,"one of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 apple two. despite the file system limitations of apple dos 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement."
37353,Sheldon,"when albert einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office."
43245,Sheldon,"no, that train has left the station. now, we can play this one of two ways. you can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and i’ll start."
39065,Sheldon,20 seconds.
37226,Sheldon,but she’s female. isn’t that the game?
43110,Sheldon,"well, i know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it."
36649,Sheldon, leonard.
38805,Sheldon,a margarita? where are we? what is happening?
43350,Sheldon,"yes. i thought, i can’t decide if i should watch the flash tv show. i know, i’ll ask amy. anyway."
45306,Sheldon,what if she’s correct? doesn’t that say something troubling about us?
45381,Sheldon,"what? you hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? what happened to our love?"
35703,Sheldon,hide me.
36965,Sheldon,"all right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone’s civil, nobody’s fighting. have a nice evening."
42659,Sheldon,"i don’t know, i’m smart and scrappy, i think i’d find a way."
41063,Sheldon,dumplings? don’t you understand what’s going on here?
45731,Sheldon,"hello, syfy network? yeah, this is your vice president of programming. now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding alphas. yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it’s me, and i don’t want to answer a lot of questions about if i really am who i say i am, you know? i just. i want this done. no, i am not the person who just called. that man was clearly a cowboy. yeah, who was plumb concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show. why do they keep hanging up on me?"
37932,Sheldon,"so we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. let’s round that up to 31."
34658,Sheldon,"every saturday since we have lived in this apartment, i have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal…."
43626,Sheldon,a month? what? are you kidding me? that would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
45215,Sheldon,"no, you didn’t. but keep in mind, i felt extremely important."
34843,Sheldon,"yes, well, he lied."
41310,Sheldon,you honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
35436,Sheldon,"captain, i’m getting an unusual reading."
40438,Sheldon,stephen hawking hates me.
36153,Sheldon,"he’s referring to an activity he has done before. it’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. this suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy."
40299,Sheldon,i do. you clear on the shampoo issue?
34518,Sheldon,well?
41331,Sheldon,"howard, raj. judas."
37164,Sheldon,"wait, excuse me, but it’s much more christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree."
38762,Sheldon,"you heard the man, leonard. and while you’re at it, i’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. point of inquiry, given that leonard is your secondary friend and koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof?"
36611,Sheldon,it’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
45411,Sheldon,that’s nice. now in german.
45074,Sheldon,"very well. hey, later we’ll check out the minibar, i’ll show you how godzilla gets drunk."
39589,Sheldon,you’re being impossible.
45189,Sheldon,"bert, i insist that you join us."
40153,Sheldon,"indeed. if i’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then i must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. jeepers! that’s yucky."
37614,Sheldon,of course they are. leonard’s being one.
40257,Sheldon,"the big deal is i was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. now, we’re going to be a faceless mass of six."
36203,Sheldon,i’m not sure. it doesn’t feel right.
40521,Sheldon,"oh, hello."
38500,Sheldon,i’m not sheldon. i’m the flash. and now i’m going to the grand canyon to scream in frustration. i’m back.
45699,Sheldon,"okay, fine. i’ll tell him. leonard, mrs. latham’s car is here for you."
35496,Sheldon,"some what? oh, yes, some sexual intercourse."
44231,Sheldon,yeah? did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?
44540,Sheldon,hello.
41408,Sheldon,"if you do that, i’ll scream."
21801,Sheldon,correct. you’ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. you may enter.
45681,Sheldon,"oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. uh, mute, please."
38681,Sheldon,yeah.
41044,Sheldon,what? that was ambiguous.
41480,Sheldon,"oh, more testing, more success, more fame. yeah, but don’t worry, i will remain the same down-to-earth humble joe i’ve always been."
34917,Sheldon,is that a dog?
41825,Sheldon,"i don’t think that will be necessary for mr. james earl jones. you heard me. the voice of darth vader, the lion king’s dad, and fyi, the guy who says, this is cnn. which also sounds like darth vader."
36747,Sheldon,"hmm. oh, who cares?"
34838,Sheldon,"simple. if she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire. "
41939,Sheldon,how about penny’s depressing acting career?
37120,Sheldon,"penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable."
38232,Sheldon,"is that really what you want to talk about, leonard?"
35683,Sheldon,thank you. did anyone touch it?
36613,Sheldon,"way ahead of you, that’s an “i can’t believe it’s not butter” stick."
36579,Sheldon,"thank you, but your sentiments may be premature."
39811,Sheldon,"of course you do. it’s about you, like everything else.  oh, thank goodness. i don’t think i had it in me to make another glass of water."
43814,Sheldon,what are you talking about?
43476,Sheldon,"oh, of course. wouldn’t want to intrude. this is yours."
43708,Sheldon,oh. that is an engagement ring that i was going to give my girlfriend amy.
37160,Sheldon,"excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on earth. frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. a crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account."
41797,Sheldon,i’m willing to if you guys are.
39166,Sheldon,all right.
35231,Sheldon,huh? 
36364,Sheldon,"no, it’s not going to be fine, change is never fine. they say it is, but it’s not."
34487,Sheldon,"what do you want, mom?"
42982,Sheldon,"when i lost my own father, i didn’t have any friends to help me through it. you do."
45137,Sheldon,"i did. you know, i’m not even sure how accurate it was. i took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad."
45122,Sheldon,you are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings.
38555,Sheldon,i call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
40535,Sheldon,"while unlikely, it’s still a statistical possibility. she might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it."
43591,Sheldon,"ah, this is fun."
42619,Sheldon,excuse me.
34399,Sheldon,could you be more specific?
38648,Sheldon,"oh, tweets about my lecture. hmm. that’s rather unfair. that’s downright cruel. plus, insects have six legs. yeah, i’m not familiar with the acronym kmn."
38043,Sheldon,"oh, gentlemen."
40789,Sheldon,"i know. go ahead, mock me. just use small words so i understand."
43050,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know. he kind of looks like a jerk. how about this one?"
36457,Sheldon,au contraire.
42310,Sheldon,any word on my stolen items?
36346,Sheldon,"okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the american spirit. did davy crockett quit at the alamo? did jim bowie?"
36505,Sheldon,"there was a tall man from cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. my body fits on it, but barely upon it, there’s no room for my big cornish head."
37184,Sheldon,"she was old and blind, leonard. what choice did we have?"
39786,Sheldon,and your father? alive?
37249,Sheldon,yes?
40146,Sheldon,"wrong, and let’s keep it clean, shall we?"
37843,Sheldon,what’s going on?
35709,Sheldon,it’s very simple. this is a  this is c…
41997,Sheldon,"i beg to differ. i used to live in those genitals. and if someone wants to move into my old room, i should at least get a vote."
45608,Sheldon,oh boy.
40990,Sheldon,"if i say yes, can we turn off that latin orgy music?"
45529,Sheldon,"no, but that list was sounding a little thin."
39444,Sheldon,open the mail!
35314,Sheldon,physiologically impossible.
43142,Sheldon,would you like to play a physics car game i invented called i can’t spy? it’s all the nail-biting tension of i spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.
41908,Sheldon,my spot on the couch has a great view of a window. sometimes i can see space battles through it. it’s called a tv.
36273,Sheldon,"okay. enough chitchat. okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. step two, enter our apartment. step three, enter my bedroom."
39763,Sheldon,"look around you, there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. really? you’re going to face armageddon without your orthotics? all right, your choice.  uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!"
42028,Sheldon,"no, don’t look to him. he’s mad at you right now."
43780,Sheldon,mm. your aunt in modesto?
42799,Sheldon,is that true?
39141,Sheldon,"not all germs. just the ones that will kill me. it’s the same way i’m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax."
38414,Sheldon,"uh, we don’t discuss anything. leonard is the signatory to the roommate agreement. as such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines."
36539,Sheldon,have you notified nasa?
38447,Sheldon,star trek. did you see star trek: the motion picture?
41364,Sheldon,"oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean jan arrah, a member of the legion of superheroes, known as element lad. and then the word he, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather h e, the abbreviation for helium. see where i’m going with this?"
34360,Sheldon,that wasn’t sarcasm?
35761,Sheldon,march 18th. you violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
39890,Sheldon,we tried. his assistant said he was on sabbatical. although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
37084,Sheldon,i refuse to sink to his level.
34738,Sheldon,i’m not hitting on her.
39546,Sheldon,"well, a, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of lascaux, and b, you play the harp. like that’s cool."
37286,Sheldon,"good lord, i could not have made this easier. hydrogen atom, h, plus pigs minus pea, higgs. bow, general zod trapped in the phantom zone. bow-zone. pear. tickle. pear-tickle. higgs boson particle. how could you not get that?"
38143,Sheldon,"as per your suggestion, we’re hanging out. quite frankly, i don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. go on, amy."
37082,Sheldon,it wasn’t funny.
36080,Sheldon,"no, that doesn’t seem any more likely."
35063,Sheldon,i want a different question.
44598,Sheldon,i thought i didn’t have a problem.
36833,Sheldon,of course i understand. and who are you to tell me about outer space?
43168,Sheldon,"you pushed it, are you out of your mind?"
36214,Sheldon,nope.
41384,Sheldon,"oh, i see your confusion. you don’t understand. indiana jones was the one in the hat with the whip."
44295,Sheldon,"oh. well, suit yourself. who wants to check me?"
43096,Sheldon,"okay, i have to tell you something, but you’re not going to like it."
35230,Sheldon,really?
43980,Sheldon,"ugh, atlantic city without the taffy? no, thank you."
36862,Sheldon,you had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
43460,Sheldon,"well, hello to you, too."
44697,Sheldon,"i was 13 years old, and on spring break from college."
39880,Sheldon,next year i’m going to epcot.
40794,Sheldon,"i’ll do what i can. but it’s not going to be easy, because when i’m with amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic"
38990,Sheldon,"well, we may never know. as my mother would say, the asians are an inscrutable folk. now, if you’ll excuse me, i have work to do."
42902,Sheldon,"we could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch."
37170,Sheldon,"if i can interject here, obviously leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate."
35562,Sheldon,"then there’s no excuse for this chicken. you know, this situation with koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood."
41593,Sheldon,"seven years ago, i found out the dvd was late and i paid for it."
41121,Sheldon,"oh, yeah."
35658,Sheldon,"no, no. leonard, i’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road."
37048,Sheldon,"all right, there’s no need to bark at me. according to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play doodle jump on his iphone. we have to fill these out. describe illness or injury."
45538,Sheldon,"or, what if we fold them?"
40185,Sheldon,"i love strawberry quik. it’s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out pepto-bismol."
37886,Sheldon,"well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together."
36523,Sheldon,i believe it is. the combination of the star trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
40226,Sheldon,"of course. i just explained it to you. now, where do you stand on it?"
41839,Sheldon,i don’t understand what we’re doing.
36177,Sheldon,"so, what do you think?"
37822,Sheldon,go ahead.
37663,Sheldon,"well, if he does, don’t believe it. he’s not above playing the dead meemaw card."
45337,Sheldon,"by the way, your name can go first."
41294,Sheldon,"she claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. i have no choice but to assume the worst, given leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions."
36362,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no…"
42303,Sheldon,"no, i’m not okay. uh, i’m wearing borrowed pants, i don’t have i.d., and one of the officers here won’t stop calling me chicken legs."
36314,Sheldon,and you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
39986,Sheldon,"yeah, please, amy! it’s got lightsabres!"
37961,Sheldon,"in order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, i need to change my diet."
34992,Sheldon,i just came by to say hello.
34259,Sheldon,well this is an interesting development. 
38818,Sheldon,"yes. must be killing you wondering who. fine, i’ll tell you. stuart from the comic bookstore, barry kripke from the university, penny’s ex-boyfriend zack and tv’s levar burton."
43650,Sheldon,i’m skippy. skippy cavanaugh.
39383,Sheldon,the prospect of fried chicken.
35699,Sheldon,i suppose. battlestar galactica comes on tonight.  and then never ever watch it.
39762,Sheldon,"you make that joke every three months. i still don’t get it. leonard, wait. what are you doing?"
34412,Sheldon,"it’s a bio-feedback technique, it’s relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, i read a paper about it in the journal of american neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but i think the basic science is valid, i probably have it here somewhere."
39571,Sheldon,penny. 
38673,Sheldon,"penny, my body and i have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other."
36284,Sheldon,"okay, now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the usb port. she calls me moon pie because i’m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the usb port. the one that looks like a little duck’s mouth."
42728,Sheldon,let’s celebrate.
45167,Sheldon,excuse me. i have a girlfriend. i’m already king of the train store.
34771,Sheldon,oh dear god! 
39953,Sheldon,hello.
36751,Sheldon,it’s oatmeal day.
37254,Sheldon,"so, why is it no longer a specialty? did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? and look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. what is mobster sauce?"
41529,Sheldon,"yes, i have. and my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills."
44690,Sheldon,"well, see, why can’t amy be that subservient? she has coitus one time, suddenly she’s gloria steinem. anyway, i suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women."
36738,Sheldon,"well, i wish i could."
35622,Sheldon,why penny?
37320,Sheldon,why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
39948,Sheldon,"why don’t i let my hair grow out? um, why don’t i start wearing birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?"
39798,Sheldon,"but candles? during a blackout? are you mad? that’s a fire hazard. no, pasadena water and power recommends the far safer glow stick."
44276,Sheldon,i know.
43313,Sheldon,"well, my mother’s been there for every honour i’ve won since i beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. how does this look?"
45813,Sheldon,isn’t this nice? the pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.
43238,Sheldon,"i bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it."
45356,Sheldon,because i am.
43019,Sheldon,the point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.
37763,Sheldon,"a, i rarely kid. and b, when i do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga."
43490,Sheldon,"you saw through that one, did you?"
39849,Sheldon,here you go. this is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by carl sagan.
44018,Sheldon,"i believe i can answer that. uh, like me, raj is demonstrating empathy. now, why don’t you accept my apology receive your free t-shirt, uh, i hope extra small is okay. for some reason wolowitz took a medium."
38580,Sheldon,i’m practicing my theremin.
36396,Sheldon,"who is it? oh hello, penny, it’s open, come in. sarcasm."
44588,Sheldon,that’s a craving. that’s a sign of chemical dependency.
38773,Sheldon,"no, no. it’s not an imposition. at this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. please, fly into our open maw, and have at it."
42762,Sheldon,cookies?
41091,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, leonard, look. he’s still available for parties and events. we should hire him."
45003,Sheldon,"oh, wait, wait, shouldn’t we just eat? you know, i mean, god did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these sloppy joes."
45748,Sheldon,"it’s me again. i gave up string theory. you should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together."
44306,Sheldon,"no, i crossed in the middle of the street. and normally, i wouldn’t, but i saw an aggressive-looking girl scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing."
43380,Sheldon,i’m sorry i’ve upset you. i shouldn’t have asked so many questions.
42304,Sheldon,"2530 east andy devine avenue,"
42582,Sheldon,"here you go, doctor. red zinger with one teaspoon of honey."
36376,Sheldon,hello. on a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
42427,Sheldon,"not according to the work of berscheid, snyder and omoto."
36901,Sheldon,i… i… i don’t understand. your grandmother’s alive?
38032,Sheldon,"that’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by gottlob frege in the 1890s!"
35232,Sheldon,"yeah, i suppose. "
36519,Sheldon,"okay, i’m sleepy now, get out."
43204,Sheldon,"you know what? i used to be a fan of evolution, but i’ve since evolved, and now i think it’s dumb."
34788,Sheldon,"libido 1, truth zero. "
44761,Sheldon,"why would she keep something from me, you know? i shared my body with that woman. and my netflix password. they recommended stella got her groove back because of her."
40159,Sheldon,doubleazinga! i do! good luck following that.
44617,Sheldon,"well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in new mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste. "
42208,Sheldon,"and now you’re gone, too. it’s like all the men i’ve looked up to have gone away."
40182,Sheldon,"i see what you’re doing. you’re attempting to build on the work of ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won’t work."
42534,Sheldon,"oh, there, well, look, there’s all kinds of videos."
38686,Sheldon,you have any frozen yogurt?
36693,Sheldon,why? why would we change? we had a perfectly good palace. tandoori palace is our palace.
34637,Sheldon,"okay, that’s it, i don’t know how, but she is cheating. no-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game. "
43831,Sheldon,"the list extends outside of science. painters like van gogh and pollock, chess champion bobby fischer, brian wilson of the beach boys.  i remember the song. it’s called darlin’ by the beach boys. oh, thank goodness. i’m not crazy. i don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride."
43137,Sheldon,"leonard, i’ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at berkeley."
43445,Sheldon,"i see. well, i think i’ll be going."
38562,Sheldon,but i made it better.
35192,Sheldon,"we might as well stop, it’s a stalemate. you’re beating me in tetris, but you’ve got the upper body strength of a keebler elf."
36971,Sheldon,"i assumed that would be your attitude. hence, my true purpose in coming here."
35953,Sheldon,for how…
35506,Sheldon,"so listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?"
38237,Sheldon,"in fact, you did, but i was referring to howard."
40701,Sheldon,"so does this fellow, but he can’t without it burning like hot soup."
36531,Sheldon,"you’re making an assumption. perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance."
44609,Sheldon,"we, we really appreciate it."
37103,Sheldon,"wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. more does not equal merry. if there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? no, we’d be suffocating."
35724,Sheldon,get out!
44277,Sheldon,"it’s nice to get back to nature. why don’t i do this more often? what a beautiful forest. hello, little butterfly. what’s your na-oh!"
40720,Sheldon,"it has been pointed out to me that some of the things i said to you could be construed as offensive, and i would like to offer you my sincerest apology."
40819,Sheldon,"roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the american flag, cannot touch the ground."
40493,Sheldon,"penny, if you wouldn’t mind, i’d like to have a conversation about girls."
37079,Sheldon,"a requirement for string theory, or m-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. i, myself, led an expedition to the arctic circle in search of said particles. kripke, i found the nozzle! i’m going to kill you!"
44975,Sheldon,who’s killing the mood now?
40268,Sheldon,wrong. she just took a sip from his diet dr. pepper.
42768,Sheldon,"oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play lord of the rings risk."
37022,Sheldon,my mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.
37047,Sheldon,"sorry. as i told you, the hero always peeks."
36205,Sheldon,"that is my desk chair, that is where i work. i don’t eat in my desk chair and i don’t work in my spot. i work in my desk chair and eat in my spot."
35578,Sheldon,then you can drive. let’s go.
45683,Sheldon,"pee for houston, pee for austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. and shake twice for texas."
39828,Sheldon,i don’t need a vacation.
45717,Sheldon,ew!
38341,Sheldon,"penny, you face failure on a daily basis. how do you cope?"
39637,Sheldon,"as a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. i said it would be nice, i didn’t say we should do it."
44900,Sheldon,professor hawking.
40408,Sheldon,yes.
39050,Sheldon,remarkable. aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?
40173,Sheldon, amy?
36472,Sheldon,"thank you. hello, neighbour."
40468,Sheldon,"so, wil, what do you have for us first?"
40156,Sheldon,"and, apparently, wil wheaton’s best friend."
37050,Sheldon,"cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. okay, medical history. have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?"
39379,Sheldon,won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?
45714,Sheldon,"take the hint, stuart. the lady said good night."
38879,Sheldon,"the wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. oh! excuse me, i’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. oh, look, my dry cleaning’s ready. and your card was the five of spades. ta-da."
34730,Sheldon,"forgive me your highness, for i am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. i did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair."
43194,Sheldon,"well, i’ll give you three guesses why i’m so irritated."
43949,Sheldon,"now, this isn’t about us, this is about what’s best for the asteroid."
41040,Sheldon,what? did she do it yet?
42753,Sheldon,there’s an argument for that. but i want to make sure.
41731,Sheldon,the philosopher henri bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object. 
42158,Sheldon,have you ever paid for a meal?
36867,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, raj, but i have no interest in playing a game in which i find no challenge."
38185,Sheldon,"oh, yes, it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina."
37101,Sheldon,leonard.
36441,Sheldon,"a moment ago, when you turned off the tv in the middle of }during the classic deep space nine/star trek the original series trouble with tribbles crossover episode. would you like some advice?"
44981,Sheldon,"oh, you’re right. i’m sorry."
42597,Sheldon,you think you’ve got problems. the gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.
39664,Sheldon,"she’d see right through that. we go to the zoo all the time. she knows my koala face. and for future reference, it’s this."
38061,Sheldon,"oh, that’s preposterous. i’m not pining over anyone."
34945,Sheldon,can you sing “soft kitty”. 
39424,Sheldon,"thanks, mom.you’re the best."
42456,Sheldon,"on the bright side, that oxford study was right. one friend down. i wonder who you’re going to lose next."
36174,Sheldon,"it’s surprising because i generally don’t feel comfortable around, well, anyone."
41061,Sheldon,"no, that’s the season two finale. that was quite the cliffhanger. i’m going to re-watch it before season three starts."
38203,Sheldon,"oh yes. it runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination."
41917,Sheldon,"no. no, i’ve changed. like the frog who’s put in a pot of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s boiling to death."
45254,Sheldon,"well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either."
36248,Sheldon,whee!
42375,Sheldon,not now.
45134,Sheldon,"yeah, well, you should be. your socks were still in it. i had to throw it away. anyway, i, uh, trust that you’ve resolved your conflict."
38701,Sheldon,"oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me."
44759,Sheldon,"her behaviour. no, i have the feeling that she’s hiding something."
44274,Sheldon,"yes, but it’s like you’re right here in the room."
41952,Sheldon,"that’s a great idea. and in the spirit of our new arrangement, i will mask my surprise that you came up with it."
40118,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, condescending means…"
39168,Sheldon,you mean the myofascial point?
34195,Sheldon,"oh, yeah."
37510,Sheldon,"yes, there is. oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape."
45811,Sheldon,"raj, be a lamb and open the door for me."
37785,Sheldon,"all right, let me show you some of the features of the room. first, windows. conventional. open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. over here is my comic book collection. feel free to browse. there’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand."
39958,Sheldon,"oh, please, everyone knows what’s going to happen. but i see your point."
34436,Sheldon,morning.
36136,Sheldon,outside? i just made cocoa.
38144,Sheldon,"did you know that, leonard?"
39442,Sheldon,nothing. it’s not suspicious that i’m fixating. it’s consistent with my personality.
43516,Sheldon,i am getting too old for this crud.
40570,Sheldon,"i think you’re high on paint fumes. and boy, that’s a lot of band-aids."
45299,Sheldon,"well, then at least hold her still so i can pretend she’s stuffed. raj, i let my emotions get the best of me, and i unfairly took it out on you."
37383,Sheldon,"given that saint valentine was a third century roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?"
42698,Sheldon,"oh, that one’s mine."
36715,Sheldon,"uh-oh, flashlight went out. i need some batteries. fellas? hello? it’s really dark down here."
36188,Sheldon,i believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
39980,Sheldon,the online game? bully!
43420,Sheldon,"i see what’s happening. sides are forming. well, if bernadette’s on amy’s team, i pick howard."
34405,Sheldon,"of course, there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code."
37713,Sheldon,"mmm, mmm, mmm. that’s eye-talian."
44483,Sheldon,"don’t laugh, she wasn’t joking."
35495,Sheldon,"hang on, leonard, while i have no respect for leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness."
45484,Sheldon,"drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. but before you do any of that, scratch my nose."
40616,Sheldon,yes. all over it.
34899,Sheldon,leonard! if i’m going to get ahead of this thing i need to find out what’s growing in my throat. 
45641,Sheldon,"please penny, enough, i have to sleep."
41762,Sheldon,no. that wouldn’t be funny at all.
39522,Sheldon,not at all.
44427,Sheldon,you’re really going without me?
40567,Sheldon,"oh, yeah. okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here."
38799,Sheldon,is it about me or the dead pixels?
40886,Sheldon,okay. shall we go to dinner?
37517,Sheldon,i found it. the ring is mine. i don’t understand why in this group i never get my way.
45809,Sheldon,be a lamb and open it for me.
37030,Sheldon,they always look. it never ends well.
38559,Sheldon,i see. and is that open for discussion?
40459,Sheldon,she sounds exactly like you.
37568,Sheldon,that’s what my sister used to say.
41971,Sheldon,why are you getting annoyed?
34286,Sheldon,from the intercom.
42841,Sheldon,perhaps this was a waste of time.
42522,Sheldon,why not?
43379,Sheldon,you still didn’t pick a date.
41246,Sheldon,"oh, seriously?"
44042,Sheldon,"oh, you are going to love her. she is the kindest, sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. in that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel."
44081,Sheldon,yes.
43506,Sheldon,viva la imodium. ay-ay-ay.
40847,Sheldon,you think this is fast? it’s just a matter of time before i see amy’s leg stubble in my shower.
36592,Sheldon, penny.
37063,Sheldon,“soft kitty” is for when you’re sick. you’re not sick.
42648,Sheldon,"well, i’ve been doing some research and i’ve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia."
44211,Sheldon,"the, the revisions i made start on page four."
44830,Sheldon,"well, i didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it."
44494,Sheldon,okay. do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?
38739,Sheldon,excellent! what are you planning to wear?
34789,Sheldon,"and i’m telling you for the last time it’s pandering, it’s undignified and bite me. "
36941,Sheldon,"oh, research lab is more than a game. it’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real."
45029,Sheldon,i was acting odd intentionally.
37767,Sheldon,"oh, penny, excellent. i have a question about these maxi pads. are the wings truly functional or have i fallen victim to marketing hype?"
37396,Sheldon,"indeed, the roommate agreement. i call your attention to the friendship rider in appendix c, future commitments. number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the large hadron collider, now under construction in switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him."
44655,Sheldon,"oh, i’m just happy i don’t know what this memory foam remembers."
45332,Sheldon,"aw, someone drew a penis in it."
36049,Sheldon,i did learn how to swim.
37756,Sheldon,"of course. pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys."
40494,Sheldon,"penny, please, i’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. and for the record, i had a full pubis of hair by the time i was 19."
45080,Sheldon,"if you find this draft acceptable, then i believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed."
41193,Sheldon,they lie so they don’t look petty.
34808,Sheldon,"forget your suit, look at my arms waving, i’m like a flamingo on ritalin. "
38833,Sheldon,"jacuzzi is a commercial brand. hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are jacuzzis."
44750,Sheldon,"thank you for your services, gentlemen. now, i’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music."
37666,Sheldon,"wait! where are you going? penny, come back! i’ll get you ice cream!"
35225,Sheldon,why? 
37948,Sheldon,"it was thanksgiving. uncle carl said, i think there’s a badger living in our chimney. hand me that flashlight. those were the last words he ever spoke to us."
38395,Sheldon,"raiders of the lost ark, with 21 additional seconds. if i can’t see it, no one else can see it."
41499,Sheldon,"and no woos. oh, not you, dr. woo. you’re fine. i want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. my so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. it was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. so please refrain from praising me for it in the future."
37603,Sheldon,i’m ready.
44731,Sheldon,oh. thank you. 
34474,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, no. no, i’ve too much to do."
36999,Sheldon,i want that one.
36666,Sheldon,it’s going to take more than i’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from penny to make up for what you’ve done to me.
36834,Sheldon,astro means star.
38378,Sheldon,"and here’s where we are. the runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of indiana jones."
43686,Sheldon,"or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic."
39567,Sheldon,and unfriend leonard hofstadter.
41885,Sheldon,"let’s see. what’s next? oh, kissing’s romantic."
44394,Sheldon,ready?
42268,Sheldon,"ugh, it’s like walking into the amazon. and not the good amazon with one-day shipping. the awful one with birds and snakes."
35052,Sheldon,formal protest.
38434,Sheldon,interesting. not body parts that usually team up. what about environmental factors? describe the scene for me.
41311,Sheldon,"excuse me. this changes nothing. except the halloween costume i’m wearing this year. amy, you’re going to be olive oyl. lay off the doughnuts."
40242,Sheldon,w-where are you going?
40562,Sheldon,"he’s in my spot. leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot."
34749,Sheldon,why would i see her again? i already have a dentist. 
43114,Sheldon,"oh, please. i have ideas all day long. reverse seaworld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. a new clothing size between medium and large called marge. snow white retold from the point of view of sneezy. why won’t doc prescribe him something? we finally find out."
36713,Sheldon,"oh, really? well, i grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and i believe i could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?"
37777,Sheldon,"i would imagine it is. this is my friend and roommate, dr. leonard hofstadter."
43029,Sheldon,"oh. well, i suppose i do think of you as a sister. and sometimes, a mother."
39797,Sheldon,and i’m sure some fool in the donner party said the snow would stop any day now. i like to think they ate him first.
34762,Sheldon,you can’t. i’m the lead author. 
41780,Sheldon,where are you going?
40371,Sheldon,i am not a loser. pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
44909,Sheldon,"you know, i wonder how she feels about all this artwork."
34859,Sheldon,"that’s the best part, you don’t have to, see i told penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force. "
35733,Sheldon,bilurrrbe.
45231,Sheldon,"very well. hey, comic-con tickets go on sale this friday. you can’t buy one."
41955,Sheldon,thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
38251,Sheldon,i came to go over your alibi for last night.
37216,Sheldon,"is that you, raj? i don’t recognize your edge."
43336,Sheldon,"you mean the box, right?"
36701,Sheldon,"howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. humorous word play."
45759,Sheldon,"but on a more serious note, the most important reason i want to go to mars is that i believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. now, i know that life on mars will be difficult. but life here on earth is no picnic. also, picnics are no picnic. where should we go for lunch? oh, i know, the ground. in conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. to mars."
40715,Sheldon,"well, hello."
40728,Sheldon,but the turn-by-turn voice option isn’t on. i know i’d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. i love the turn-by-turn voice option.
35898,Sheldon,i see. apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and leonard crossed some sort of line. i apologize.
38054,Sheldon,"you didn’t break up, she dumped you."
42672,Sheldon,hello.
42073,Sheldon,why would i be jealous?
41610,Sheldon,"it smells wonderful. is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? because i, too, know…"
34767,Sheldon,if i’m not taking credit for our work then nobody is. 
42900,Sheldon,"well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright."
37855,Sheldon,your surprise confuses me. i live here.
40592,Sheldon,don’t rush it. we may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.
45112,Sheldon,surprisingly well.
43060,Sheldon,"huh, that’s exactly what leonard, wolowitz, koothrappali, bernadette and penny said."
38504,Sheldon,  penny.
40553,Sheldon,"yeah, that was five weeks ago. how much longer is he gonna milk that cow?"
39020,Sheldon,what is that you’re eating? tonight is pizza night.
39160,Sheldon,"unless he takes bernadette’s last name. and considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him."
44672,Sheldon,great.
41804,Sheldon,"well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. uh, penny, you’ll need a straw."
38163,Sheldon,screwed.
42823,Sheldon,i’ve been cooped up in here too long. maybe i need some fresh air.
41471,Sheldon,when did we get to the cheesecake factory?
44955,Sheldon,"this is for you. i was going to wrap it, but touching scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies."
45802,Sheldon,sing me soft kitty.
43315,Sheldon,"maybe they’ll be best friends. one of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. sound familiar?"
37806,Sheldon,"i must say, i’m shocked by this betrayal."
34526,Sheldon,"i don’t know what the protocol is here. do i stay, do i leave? do i wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage? "
35487,Sheldon,"leonard, you have to do something about penny. she is interfering with my sleep, she’s interfering with my work, and if i had another significant aspect of my life, i’m sure she’d be interfering with that too."
45483,Sheldon,"wait, i need help getting down."
41726,Sheldon,why is that funny? that’s just unhygienic.
44309,Sheldon,amy.
43450,Sheldon,and you know why? ‘cause you’re a man. the champagne of genders.
36253,Sheldon,and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you’re going as far as portland.
41758,Sheldon,does that mean the relationship is over?
41760,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry."
35198,Sheldon,"what would we talk about? we’ve no overlapping areas of interest i’m aware of, and you know i don’t care for chit-chat. "
41667,Sheldon,"no, no, of course you have to publish. that’s your responsibility as a scientist. doing otherwise would be unethical. you have no choice."
41715,Sheldon,why?
45589,Sheldon,"hey, i hate to break up the party, but amy says i’m tired and have to go to bed."
34839,Sheldon,"well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today. "
45530,Sheldon,so trick her.
37348,Sheldon,"and that didn’t work out, did it?"
36133,Sheldon,okay.
38390,Sheldon,no!
44223,Sheldon,what?
41602,Sheldon,now i know how the african slaves felt. being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
39137,Sheldon,"oh, i’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in d-dimensional de sitter space."
44227,Sheldon,great. now i’m gonna have that song in my head all day.
39227,Sheldon,what are you doing?
42189,Sheldon,"arthur jeffries was a scientist. i’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. you know, if he were here, i think he’d say enjoy star wars day."
39961,Sheldon,"hello, leonard, do you like my bongos? bet you didn’t know that i had bongos."
35579,Sheldon,you did.
40453,Sheldon,"yeah, way ahead of you. i will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world."
38381,Sheldon,"oh, i informed you thusly. i so informed you thusly."
36780,Sheldon,"obviously, waitressing at the cheesecake factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. bazinga! you know, using positive reinforcement techniques, i could train that behaviour out of her in a week."
45193,Sheldon,"actually, we met online."
39311,Sheldon,don’t thank me. thank the dice. they told me what percentage of my face to shave.
44315,Sheldon,oh. never have i ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.
41052,Sheldon,"i just found out that you recommended myself, dr. hofstadter and dr. koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure."
40469,Sheldon,"it’s true. in 1982, wil played the voice of martin the mouse in the secret of nimh. you moved me."
44386,Sheldon,you get where i’m going here?
43152,Sheldon,let me ask you this. do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?
42485,Sheldon,"well, good lord, no, have you seen jaws?"
36654,Sheldon,"what’s going on is i was led to believe i was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, i was being fed false data at the hands of wolowitz, koothrappali and your furry little boy toy."
40478,Sheldon,i was out raising heck with mr. wil wheaton. four hours more and we would have closed down the hometown buffet.
37672,Sheldon,i was going to get my mail.
36071,Sheldon,"you know, i am a fan of ventriloquism. maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. he could talk while you drink."
42915,Sheldon,he just left another comment.
42265,Sheldon,how dare the university force me to go back to string theory?
36574,Sheldon,listen to you. how can i possibly go?
36508,Sheldon,penny.
38118,Sheldon,that is apt and amusing. i think i shall share that with amy farrah fowler. she’ll appreciate the witticism.
40917,Sheldon,"oh, that sounds terrible. why would i want to do that?"
36670,Sheldon,"but i would like to remind you that in science, there’s no such thing as failure. there once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. that man’s name was, surprise, surprise, albert einstein."
35867,Sheldon,radiation burns. a little mishap while i was building my own cat scanner.
35503,Sheldon,right. 22. 
36072,Sheldon,"this appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. no, one expects to see hominids learning to use bones as weapeons."
35915,Sheldon,"you’re welcome, dr. hofstadter."
42417,Sheldon,"for starters, we enjoy spending time together."
38678,Sheldon,action.
35715,Sheldon,"shh. all right, i’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause."
36944,Sheldon,why not?
38188,Sheldon,"excuse me. i object. you propose a guessing game, yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. for the record, i was going to say your sister priya."
45183,Sheldon,i have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
34986,Sheldon,no. hmmm. what happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
37358,Sheldon,a menial job. like yours.
40282,Sheldon,you do?
45221,Sheldon,"oh, i know that now. at first, i thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified."
41316,Sheldon,"hurts, doesn’t it? you know, i find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true."
41334,Sheldon,i suppose so.
37651,Sheldon,"oh, yes. the losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. fyi, i plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited velikovsky hypothesis."
36232,Sheldon,it’s like talking to a chimp.
35640,Sheldon,aced it.
42350,Sheldon,"but if i’m a professor, then i’ll have to teach a class."
37440,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t want to know that! how can i possibly discuss with stan lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?"
40354,Sheldon,"yes, it’s just that in all the years i’ve known him, he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. i was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened."
37798,Sheldon,"ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. i’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer."
45490,Sheldon,thank you.
35111,Sheldon,are you upset about something? 
42336,Sheldon,"yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the cloud."
40133,Sheldon,"oh, i understand the confusion. i have never said that you are not good at what you do. it’s just that what you do is not worth doing."
39868,Sheldon,"you know, i have ten fingers and ten toes. if i tell you a story about each one of them, we’ll be here all day, let’s just move on."
34558,Sheldon,"sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  you clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry."
34549,Sheldon,"way ahead of you. i was thinking of moving big boy to thursdays, and just dropping soup plantation. "
35948,Sheldon,i understand. all i need is for you to authorize these tests.
42115,Sheldon,"oh, no. what have i done?"
37283,Sheldon,"oh, as small as leonard is, i don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch."
37187,Sheldon,i didn’t make tea for you. this is my tea.
41754,Sheldon,i forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.
34774,Sheldon,i don’t understand the question.
34398,Sheldon,"oh, goody, we’re getting a cat. "
44601,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll just toss this out to the room. um, i was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. now, i couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but i did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. you know, the interesting fact about the rectum…"
39807,Sheldon,what are you proposing?
42440,Sheldon,he makes a valid point.
42819,Sheldon,okay. here we go. proton decay. proton decay.  proton decay. proton decay.
43545,Sheldon,"well, it’s not like i’m never going to see you two again. which brings us to article 23 subsection c, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion."
36116,Sheldon,i sincerely hope so.
40603,Sheldon,what can i say? i put the fun in funeral.
34504,Sheldon,can’t we just go to big boy? they only have one burger. the big boy. 
36676,Sheldon,grateful.
43696,Sheldon,"i think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. spock came from a planet governed only by logic. you know, on vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, i’m not. you’re moving my arm. to which he says, fascinating. and then you both watch educational television."
39487,Sheldon,"leonard, i was just mentioning an interesting local news item. now, thanks to you, i’m worried amy’s been eaten by a bobcat."
40656,Sheldon,what happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?
39454,Sheldon,are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
36353,Sheldon,i have complete faith that you will make them. good night.
41476,Sheldon,"did i? well, that can’t be right. no one’s ever done that before. except me, because i just did it. sheldon and his brain, yeah. sheldon and his brain, yeah. sheldon and his brain, yeah. sheldon and his brain, yeah. sheldon and his brain…"
44946,Sheldon,will you keep it down? what kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think i’m running?
37837,Sheldon,make it so.
34706,Sheldon,it might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one’s children enter the medical profession. 
41599,Sheldon,"uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year i criticize it. do our traditions mean nothing to you?"
34364,Sheldon,check.
45514,Sheldon,what’s the occasion?
40138,Sheldon,i want to thank you for taking time to see me.
41466,Sheldon,"my point is, we’re a couple, and i like you for who you are, quirks and all."
40605,Sheldon,"i’m not allowed to wear my silver surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?"
41716,Sheldon,"ugh, all right, i’ll go. but from what i’ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control."
44745,Sheldon,hit it.
38201,Sheldon,"you are in a forest. there is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. go east. an iron gate blocks your way. open gate. it’s locked. hmm, well, so much for that."
35659,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i know that now."
21836,Sheldon,explain the couch.
35565,Sheldon,"yes, lucky."
43374,Sheldon,okay.
44638,Sheldon,i guess this is it.
43905,Sheldon,"well, i enjoyed that more than i thought i would."
39833,Sheldon,yes. that’s how velma and scooby smuggled shaggy into the old lighthouse.
39327,Sheldon,"two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? okay, let’s go for it."
37507,Sheldon,fascinating.
37670,Sheldon,wheaton!
35420,Sheldon,she called me dumbass.
37636,Sheldon,i’m not too proud to admit that i cried myself to sleep.
34253,Sheldon,it took you four years to get through high school?
42312,Sheldon,"leonard. oh, i’m so happy to see you."
37412,Sheldon,drat. no frodo for you.
44331,Sheldon,"well, i should hope so. tomorrow’s picture day."
39336,Sheldon,"hello, wil wheaton."
34264,Sheldon,"oh, good. then you won’t be disappointed."
42201,Sheldon,be careful with that.
40501,Sheldon,i drink tea all the time. i think i know what i’m doing.
45296,Sheldon,i hadn’t thought about that.
37176,Sheldon,you did.
38851,Sheldon,"howard, if i may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? granted, you’re just an engineer, but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s nobel prize acceptance speech."
37118,Sheldon,why can’t leonard teach you?
40473,Sheldon,"well, you’re my girlfriend and i don’t want you to be upset. then again, wil wheaton’s my friend and i don’t want him to be upset. hmm, this is a sticky wicket.  what do you think?"
35158,Sheldon,"oh. okay. you know, i don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d begun with that thought. "
44800,Sheldon,"gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. now, do amy and i continue living together? or do i move back in with leonard?"
43656,Sheldon,"not technically. in chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. uh, you have plenty of moves available. you could beat us up and steal the money. you could kill us, you know. really, you’re only limited by your imagination."
36650,Sheldon,whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
39678,Sheldon,"ooh, a pocket watch."
38009,Sheldon,"incorrect. obviously, the answer is cheese danish."
43203,Sheldon,do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
45047,Sheldon,"oh, penny, i’m trying to take an interest in other people. uh, how was your girls’ night?"
39321,Sheldon,"should i use the rest room or wait until we get home? come on, papa needs to void his bladder. oh, that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks."
36156,Sheldon,that seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
35893,Sheldon,"more to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together."
45174,Sheldon,there’s no way.
38676,Sheldon,gotcha.
44589,Sheldon,"no, i know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. i mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, pringles. you know once one pops one just can’t stop."
45823,Sheldon,"leonard, are you listening to me?  "
39764,Sheldon,and that’s why we wear hard hats.
38728,Sheldon,no!
41129,Sheldon,"oh, my. what an honour. oh, this is like being asked to ascend mount olympus and dine with the gods."
41229,Sheldon,my queen can now take your rook from below.
44047,Sheldon,meemaw. i’m so happy to see you.
43900,Sheldon,hello.
40457,Sheldon,"i won’t. this feels right. my mother always said, to thine own self be true."
34260,Sheldon,it has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
43643,Sheldon,was she helping him with his research?
36453,Sheldon,more wrong? wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
36898,Sheldon,"oh, yes."
38372,Sheldon,knock-knock.
44765,Sheldon,"well, i won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. i have no choice but to confront her."
36813,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. anyway, i got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me."
42373,Sheldon,i am trying to prepare my lesson plan for howard. why are you telling me this?
41901,Sheldon,"i can’t talk right now, i have several thousand updates to install."
38783,Sheldon,"buona sera, luigi’s pizza. buona sera. it means good evening in italian. may i say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?"
38024,Sheldon,"may i point out that for eight long months, i suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative tv documentaries about the jersey shore."
40622,Sheldon,"i’m surprised to hear that. see, the other day, i was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, i took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab."
45753,Sheldon,"thiospinel sulfide. thiospinel sulfide. that’s even more fun than gee-ode. hey, did you see the lego movie?"
36537,Sheldon,"do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of mountain dew?"
36591,Sheldon, penny.
35424,Sheldon,i’m sorry.
37188,Sheldon,it’s a conversation starter.
39836,Sheldon,i have gps on my phone. i know you turned around.
34508,Sheldon,we don’t. this is a disturbing aberration. 
37709,Sheldon,perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.
34697,Sheldon,we said no tanks.
37460,Sheldon,"you don’t need to reimburse me because i’m not paying. on thursday, i will have my day in court and justice will be done. in fact, i’m going to begin preparing my defence right now."
37845,Sheldon,"in what universe is this low-pulp? good morning, penny."
35341,Sheldon,"actually, i’d say she’s a poor man’s madhuri dixit. "
45416,Sheldon,"mind you, when we say behind the flags, we don’t literally mean these flags. that’s just where we have dinner."
36465,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i can’t imagine any of that."
37225,Sheldon,all right. there’s a female.
34489,Sheldon,what for?
42867,Sheldon,"oh, you said it."
36131,Sheldon,"i’m at a loss. if you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder i overlooked."
42631,Sheldon,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. just because i love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room."
38991,Sheldon,did you get that?
37976,Sheldon,thank you. they’re my mother’s.
38906,Sheldon,"that game? excuse me, penny, but doodle jump is a game. angry birds is a game. world of warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing… all right, technically it’s a game."
34853,Sheldon,"yes, if she googles leopold houston she’ll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com."
36554,Sheldon,"i don’t see why i have to worry. my career’s not hanging in the balance. that was a joke. it’s funny, because it’s true."
42594,Sheldon,"no, i’d look silly in that helmet."
42253,Sheldon,mm.
37525,Sheldon,"excellent, excellent. tire each other out, the ring will be mine. howard, why don’t you go after raj’s mother?"
40585,Sheldon,"which i find totally unacceptable. i must be the bigger man. therefore, you may use my spot until such time as i learn to drive or get a batmobile."
37319,Sheldon,then i’ve been up all night.
42855,Sheldon, ladies?
45569,Sheldon,"many years ago. back when she was a grad student. she’s always been a huge fan of my work, and now she’s doing research at caltech."
39716,Sheldon,"well, then, i guess it’s plausible. hang on a second, mister."
39224,Sheldon,"if there’s ever a church of sheldon, this will be when it started. ow!"
42390,Sheldon,will you stop it. this is a classroom. this is not american bandstand.
37058,Sheldon,"possible tourette’s. all right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. soup tattoo on right buttock."
39713,Sheldon,without shoes?
34907,Sheldon,"leonard, where are you? "
39579,Sheldon,i’m the guy.
34536,Sheldon,i don’t come into your house and touch your board.
37141,Sheldon,how can you not know? i just told you. have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
44030,Sheldon,"emily, as i’m sure you know, i’m considered an odd fellow. but what you don’t know is that, while i often say the wrong thing, in my heart i mean well. i think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? and we all think that you can do better than koothrappali."
45058,Sheldon,"well, if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me, then i’ll miss you x plus one."
45184,Sheldon,"if the judge couldn’t explain it to me, i don’t see how you will."
37802,Sheldon,"excuse me. i’m uncomfortable with you recommending that leonard pursue having intercourse with dr. plimpton, who i assure you has better things to do."
38538,Sheldon,"leonard, please, we can talk during our break. we have one coming up at midnight. we’ll need snacks."
36535,Sheldon,"you have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. if that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy."
38306,Sheldon,"well, i did mention the mars rover incident to that fbi agent and probably cost howard his security clearance."
37329,Sheldon,"peas! perfect, they can be electrons."
35430,Sheldon,"i will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. you kids have fun."
39370,Sheldon,"look, everyone. wil wheaton is my friend!"
44969,Sheldon,"i’m not sure. earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it’s feeling forced, like all the pirates of the caribbean sequels."
35227,Sheldon,"on my twelfth birthday i really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, i could separate radioactive isotopes. "
42278,Sheldon,"so, tomorrow?"
42811,Sheldon,"there we go, compromising again. we really are the best."
38491,Sheldon,"that’s sad. let’s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of krypton?"
42371,Sheldon,no.
40541,Sheldon,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… drat. i’m never going to get to forty-three again. one, two, three, four… rats."
37368,Sheldon,"senior theoretical particle physicist at caltech, focusing on m theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory."
37786,Sheldon,"in here, you’ll find emergency provisions. an eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of star trek: the original series on a high-density flash drive."
43698,Sheldon,of course. excuse me. this will just take a moment.
41678,Sheldon,"now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?"
38472,Sheldon,please don’t drag this out. this is never going to come off.
39058,Sheldon,are you suggesting i play dirty?
45662,Sheldon,"you set it on dts, didn’t you?"
42227,Sheldon,"that was awkward, right?"
44602,Sheldon,you don’t shove them. they come with an easy-glide applicator.
44303,Sheldon,got it.
44968,Sheldon,very well.
39583,Sheldon,"excuse me. excuse me. pardon me. pardon me. excuse me. hi, stuart."
42146,Sheldon,"and amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always."
36750,Sheldon,the math would suggest that in a few i’m a clown made of candy. but i don’t dance.
36378,Sheldon,"hang on. are you now or have you ever been a salsa, irish folk or break-dancer?"
45271,Sheldon,"if real dogs gave me buttons, i’d like them, too. well, i think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend."
34495,Sheldon,"um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when i called you an idiot. and i just wanted to say that i was wrong. to point it out. "
38896,Sheldon,"that’s from avatar, world of warcraft takes place in azeroth. goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?"
42498,Sheldon,that’s my boy.
34690,Sheldon,the only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
43439,Sheldon,"oh, you don’t need to worry about her. she’s brilliant and attractive. she can do way better"
40043,Sheldon,was i hit on the head by a coconut.
38220,Sheldon,"oh. well, good job, quite convincing. i smell perfume."
44836,Sheldon,"oh, i am. and you realize what the next step is?"
34860,Sheldon,un-unravelable. 
38693,Sheldon,why would we want to do that? it’s called the comfort zone for a reason.
39911,Sheldon,who’s unsatisfactory in p.e. now?
35766,Sheldon,you’re sitting in my spot.
37990,Sheldon,"coming! . greetings, friends."
42947,Sheldon,"if i was okay, i would’ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello."
40996,Sheldon,don’t.
43947,Sheldon,okay. guess we’re gonna talk about you now.
45389,Sheldon,"wait, wait. where’s my bag? my phone and my wallet are in my bag."
40872,Sheldon,"ah, alex, excellent. i have a research problem that i believe you can help with."
36577,Sheldon,"good news, gentlemen, i have tentatively accepted…"
40495,Sheldon,"well, it’s been a rough day. i usually go chamomile tea, but i don’t think that’s going to cut it."
39233,Sheldon,as well you should. but i’m going to make an exception here.
40936,Sheldon,"how can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can’t remember no tomato on my hamburger?"
44020,Sheldon,"i caused that fight, i feel terrible. wait, i can do that better. i caused that fight. i feel terrible. yeah, wow, i don’t know which one i like more."
40057,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t want a broken toy.  nothing!"
38989,Sheldon,"did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?"
43996,Sheldon,"hey, we’re both great at this."
45581,Sheldon,"oh, fun. like a play date."
45567,Sheldon,"oh, not at all. i’ve had outings with leonard and raj in the evening, and, oh, i had lunch"
45059,Sheldon,"here. you’re sad, so i made you tea."
45236,Sheldon,"your father may have spoiled you, but i won’t. if you want a ticket to comic-con, i suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself."
42952,Sheldon,"no, i said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science."
37541,Sheldon,"and you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? i am the william shatner of theoretical physics. all right, i’ll play. what self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?"
40901,Sheldon,what’s wrong?
42894,Sheldon,not just a sticker. that is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.
35370,Sheldon,"that was not fifteenth century soap, my god those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it."
39984,Sheldon,i use it to get the right way. the fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
41560,Sheldon,"yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? i finally decided what prize i want. hurry up."
40788,Sheldon,"all right, geez. what a grouch."
39719,Sheldon,here’s two dollars. go buy some beef jerky.
38950,Sheldon,agreed. wait till you hear how he dumbs down werner heisenberg for the crowd. you may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.
42957,Sheldon,"oh, give me that. just out of curiosity, if i were to let something go, how would i do that?"
45663,Sheldon,i’m still within earshot! you may want to wait for my door to close.
42277,Sheldon,so when will you reopen?
45779,Sheldon,no.
35378,Sheldon,you know how i know we’re not in the matrix?
42806,Sheldon,"i understand. either way, i want you to know that i’m aware of how difficult i can be. so i just want to say thank you for putting up with me."
42555,Sheldon,we’ll take some funyuns.
34237,Sheldon,"i didn’t invent them, they’re there."
39044,Sheldon,and there’s your answer.
37042,Sheldon,all the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
45021,Sheldon,you managed the situation?
41676,Sheldon,"oh, everything is just sex with you isn’t it?"
37406,Sheldon,"morning, old chum."
43136,Sheldon,they did.
35794,Sheldon,penny.
41341,Sheldon,thank you.
37531,Sheldon,i said stop it!
43695,Sheldon,"the first episode of star trek: the original series i ever saw was the galileo seven. uh, spock had just landed on the planet taurus ii. then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. after that day, i was hooked. on star trek, not my brother’s sphincter-based cuisine."
44521,Sheldon,"speaking of love, stds among the elderly are skyrocketing."
42695,Sheldon,"yeah. tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. amy, you’re a neuroscientist. crack his skull open, spray some raid in there."
41412,Sheldon,"my father used to say that all the time. that and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? but what does that have to do with you working at the university?"
36937,Sheldon,you know. mimesis. an action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. mimesis.
37554,Sheldon,"come on, mother, you know why i can’t accept the award. with all due respect, i don’t think praying will help. no, i have not heard the song, jesus, take the wheel. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don’t need to start singing it. yes, i’ll buy it on the itunes, mother. good-bye, mother.  hello."
43148,Sheldon,"play that funky music, white boy."
39495,Sheldon,"i knew it. just keep going, i guess i’m good at this."
40775,Sheldon,and i am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here.
38655,Sheldon,isn’t that their burden? i’m the one with something interesting to say.
37295,Sheldon,better.
43816,Sheldon,"let’s see. hey, i was humming. one point for hufflepuff. what song is that?"
45525,Sheldon,"yes. i may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but i still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company. although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, i’m sure that’ll be leaving me, too."
45044,Sheldon,"oh, well you know, that is interesting. i wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. my money’s on fungal. they’re still having girls night across the hall."
44869,Sheldon,how did you deal with it?
39496,Sheldon,"when they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘cause i can see how that could stick in someone’s craw."
34743,Sheldon,what did i do? 
44885,Sheldon,really? i didn’t know that.
38166,Sheldon,i’m removing my digital footprint from the internet so amy farrah fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.
42180,Sheldon,i’m fine.
39324,Sheldon,"well, off the top of my head, i’d have to go with excalibur. it gives you the right to rule england."
41388,Sheldon,amy has a fondness for the comic strip marmaduke.
38462,Sheldon,it’s simple biology. there’s nothing i can do about it.
39746,Sheldon,"speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? the tiny landlocked nation of andorra. oh, the next classic episode of sheldon cooper presents fun with flags is writing itself."
40388,Sheldon,wait. i’m a little concerned. blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
35696,Sheldon,he does on wednesdays.
37475,Sheldon,only a suggestion. a catch in your throat would work just as well.
41769,Sheldon,"i’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.  penny. sorry."
45521,Sheldon,"princeton? a fine institution. the place where albert einstein taught. and where leonard got his phd, so it may have gone downhill."
39401,Sheldon,"i’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, mom. i’m taking you to see saul perlmutter give a lecture about his nobel prize-winning work in cosmology. and the best part is, at the q and a afterward, i’ve worked up a couple of q’s that will stump his sorry a."
34712,Sheldon,"okay, there’s a lab animal supply company in reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may i suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours. "
38417,Sheldon,"do you even think about other people, leonard? do you?"
39366,Sheldon,"fighting for our friendship. as peculiar and annoying as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. i’m not going to let that end here tonight. now put down that drink, let’s meet brent spiner and go home."
42884,Sheldon,"yeah, darn straight, you can’t. try to tell a grown man to go to sleep."
40123,Sheldon,i knew it.
41782,Sheldon,really?
45682,Sheldon,"no, goofy, no."
39816,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know. but whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no leonard’s day."
34959,Sheldon,"so, you see it too."
44335,Sheldon,"tonight i’ll be watching a show rated m.a., and that stands for mature audiences, buster."
37549,Sheldon,"thank you. yeah, i’ll bear that in mind if i’m ever nominated for the hillbilly peace prize."
45025,Sheldon,how would you feel if i contacted your mother behind your back?
35185,Sheldon,"well, she might be interested to know that i have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory. "
44991,Sheldon,hello.
38966,Sheldon,"oh, please, i was just pointing it out. i have no desire to engage in the activity."
37552,Sheldon,"i was valedictorian and expected to give an address. even now, i can remember that moment when i walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. there must have been thousands of people. my heart started pounding in my chest. i began to hyperventilate. my vision became blurry, and before i knew it… oh, dear. "
36712,Sheldon,are you bothered that i can so easily manipulate you?
36724,Sheldon,"excuse me, are you professor crawley?"
42251,Sheldon,"you tell me. dear esteemed colleagues, as you may know, i have requested to change my field of study. my decision to do so is, i believe, in the best interest of science. at your convenience, i’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand."
35595,Sheldon,"well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine."
35189,Sheldon,i’m a theoretical physicist.
37939,Sheldon,that’s no threat. my mother’s always wanted a grandchild.
37502,Sheldon,"plus, i get to hang out with him again at the hearing. this is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from leonard nimoy."
43059,Sheldon,so you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
35089,Sheldon,"then i have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there’s a small gap, don’t look down if you’re subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell. "
39757,Sheldon,emergency preparedness drill.
43528,Sheldon,"all right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite."
40944,Sheldon,"i suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. harry potter’s j.k. rowling, uh, star trek’s d.c. fontana."
36292,Sheldon,this package came while you were at work.
45427,Sheldon,"oh, hello."
36027,Sheldon,"it is also indigenous to brazil, as is the cocoa bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. and you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!"
45648,Sheldon,i’ve got it! i finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!
43928,Sheldon,"well, i can be helpful. give me something to do. you know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes i figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register. it was my father. yeah, dad lost his job, but mr. hinckley gave me a fudgsicle."
42932,Sheldon,professor hawking?
44428,Sheldon,"you don’t have the authority to save places in the line. if i do that, i’ll be cutting."
37117,Sheldon,"a little physics? there’s no such thing. physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies."
43948,Sheldon,"okay, back to me. i discovered an asteroid, and now i get to name it."
44748,Sheldon,"so, let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know nevis.  well, i, i like that, but next time check with me."
35499,Sheldon,zip it pip it. can i have your phone number?
36998,Sheldon,really? where’s your friend justin going to sleep?
44662,Sheldon,really? i slept great.
34230,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m not expert here but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements."
43252,Sheldon,"uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask leonard for advice about this?"
39736,Sheldon,why are you waving a white flag?
38194,Sheldon,"the fun starts with brunch at carney’s in studio city, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. next stop, travel town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the hollywood carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car."
39467,Sheldon,it was a harmless halloween prank. look.
36995,Sheldon, raj.
43165,Sheldon,is that the attitude that helped you get penny?
41509,Sheldon,"she’s sick, i knew it. bye."
39446,Sheldon,"well, no, no, i need something more permanent to join these papers. say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?"
39742,Sheldon,"confound it! you’re right, it’s brilliant. let’s take it from the top."
41820,Sheldon,i didn’t even get to that part.
34824,Sheldon,yes. 
45704,Sheldon,have you ever thought of teaching physics?
42620,Sheldon,"i can’t do this. and for your information, leonard, the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck."
37925,Sheldon,"apparently, a semi-incestuous teens for jesus fourth of july hoedown didn’t count."
39073,Sheldon,"you may have gone to cambridge, but i’m an honorary graduate of starfleet academy."
36594,Sheldon,no. this is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic north pole.
42203,Sheldon,"when obi-wan came to luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. so, um, what do you got for me?"
34300,Sheldon,they would be gastronomically redundant. i can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
38289,Sheldon,oh. all right. i doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved oedipal complex.
45279,Sheldon,"yes, probably. but until we know for sure, how can i feel better?"
38245,Sheldon,why do you get to be batman?
44302,Sheldon,so i drink.
41135,Sheldon,"yeah, yeah, we’ll be right there. leonard?"
44250,Sheldon,just wait.
39209,Sheldon,"that sounds like sarcasm, but i’m going to disregard it, because i have an agenda. paintball. specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, i thought we should establish a chain of command. now, it goes without saying that i would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? now, i don’t see me as some four-star general, back at hq riding a desk and playing golf with the secretary of defence. but i also can’t be sergeant cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular joe. this might take some thought. as you were."
42213,Sheldon,wow. a death star cake.
44289,Sheldon,"well done, it worked, we’re going."
43889,Sheldon,oh.
38810,Sheldon,"indeed. yeah, at one point, raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. it was like the last days of caligula.  oh, i have to get this. umbrella?"
21818,Sheldon,"when you have to? i’m sorry, i don’t rent to hippies."
41011,Sheldon,"while i disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn’t diminish my output. you know, i’m like the sun. can’t turn this off."
41001,Sheldon,there’s nothing to worry about. your secret’s safe with me.
44321,Sheldon,"i like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting."
42793,Sheldon,"oh, yes. i, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. did i say anything? no. i compromised and kept my mouth shut. like you should’ve, because everyone was laughing at you."
43848,Sheldon,"oh, thank you."
35654,Sheldon,i’m transcending the situation. i’m clearly too evolved for driving.
34964,Sheldon,"he’s not wrong. alright, and this is my office."
40436,Sheldon,does it affect me?
45595,Sheldon,"that may be true, but dr. nowitzki’s just a friend. in fact, i wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom."
43509,Sheldon,are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
36787,Sheldon,have a chocolate.
40721,Sheldon,"yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that i take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the future."
37032,Sheldon,it doesn’t feel like an arm.
40279,Sheldon,good night. i’m sorry. this is really important.
40714,Sheldon,"yes. no, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn’t racist. he’s also brown."
39552,Sheldon,"oh, leonard. lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can’t until you admit the problem."
43465,Sheldon,"sonny and cher made it work. their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them."
34827,Sheldon,i’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to penny. 
38939,Sheldon,careful. that’s a collectible.
44722,Sheldon,okay. i can do this. just give me a moment… oh! mimosas coming up.
44124,Sheldon,forget helium. the real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice.
43693,Sheldon,all right. but this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.
40203,Sheldon,"dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity."
44085,Sheldon,"if any of you are looking for something to do on valentine’s day, amy and i’ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of fun with flags. you’re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric."
36424,Sheldon,"amazing spider-man, ultimate spider-man, spectacular spider-man, the marvelous adventures of spider-man, spider-man 2099?"
44592,Sheldon,"just, please, bear with me if i display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal."
44847,Sheldon,anything you’d like to pet? not my hair. there’s a lot of goop in it.
41424,Sheldon,"yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. from what i gather, brevity is your friend. so, are we good here?"
43939,Sheldon,"yeah, me, too. i was stuck for a metaphor."
42653,Sheldon,"well, then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves i bought for you to do the dishes?"
43962,Sheldon,i’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.
40452,Sheldon,you’re right. i guess i just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. he played! he played! coop and rolling thunder are together again. he was okay with that nickname.
44557,Sheldon,why would your bernadette thing make me feel better? at least mine was educational.
40604,Sheldon, amy.
41658,Sheldon,"i’m back down to nine friends. make it eight, i’m sick of wolowitz, too."
42785,Sheldon,"oh. well, that’s all right. there were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented."
44976,Sheldon,can i look yet?
43978,Sheldon,"you know, i’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. when penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly i could barely hear the television."
44393,Sheldon,"oh, i have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop."
45537,Sheldon,"all right, then. let’s go to the bedroom, remove our clothes, fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking."
40763,Sheldon,"so they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. that’s hard cheese, barry. you’re one of the good ones."
44308,Sheldon,"oh, and how."
35946,Sheldon,"my aunt marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. she thought if i failed at theoretical physics that i should have a trade to fall back on. and by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer."
37562,Sheldon,"i see. well, i assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. go ahead, howard. dazzle me."
45362,Sheldon,run down the pros and cons of each for me.
37929,Sheldon,"my mistake. now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. plus or minus eight men."
42228,Sheldon,is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?
37145,Sheldon,okay! at what point did you begin to feel lost?
38133,Sheldon,it’s not a home. it’s a senior centre.  we’d never put meemaw in a home!
41391,Sheldon,"ooh, i think she’s a fan of garfield as well. oh, darn it, now so am i."
39322,Sheldon,"hurry, hurry, hurry."
39900,Sheldon,rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock was created by internet pioneer sam kass as an improvement on the classic game rock-paper-scissors. all hail sam kass.
38443,Sheldon,how about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
39989,Sheldon,do you supply the the tennis ball?
43841,Sheldon,"amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, i really want to be your boyfriend."
37842,Sheldon,"thank you. lift with your knees, not your back. good night."
41374,Sheldon,i’m not a child. i know the word ninny.
38322,Sheldon,"if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we’d all have a merry christmas. think about that, dr. tyson."
35509,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?"
45344,Sheldon,"just because i am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean i’m sensitive."
42412,Sheldon,"yeah, which i was initially sceptical of until i saw online that they serve yorkshire pudding."
43547,Sheldon,let me help you. l. e. o. n.
36542,Sheldon,"for what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make jesus cry."
34319,Sheldon,what’s your formula for the corner.
41210,Sheldon,no!
44340,Sheldon,"apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more."
43329,Sheldon,i was a handful.
43602,Sheldon,"look at this blister. like it or not, we’re athletes now. besides, a bar is where i belong. i’m having female problems."
44058,Sheldon,"a texas special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. thank you, meemaw."
42200,Sheldon,those are your jedi robes.
39075,Sheldon,"are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?"
35014,Sheldon,"oh, please. for vulcans, mating, or, if you will, pon farr, it’s an extremely private matter."
41230,Sheldon,"if i make this move, but i won’t because we’re having too much fun."
45499,Sheldon,to success without raj.
34304,Sheldon,"thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth."
37731,Sheldon,thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
44764,Sheldon,"oh. well, i feel both flattered and hurt. like when people say i look like that skeleton from nightmare before christmas."
43778,Sheldon,"if there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?"
35413,Sheldon,"alright, let’s say i go to dinner alone. and during the meal i have to use the rest room. how do i know someone’s not touching my food?"
36638,Sheldon,"i just want you both to know, when i publish my findings, i won’t forget your contributions."
43914,Sheldon,at a neurobiology conference? what a mean thing to say.
37691,Sheldon,"well, usually i’m on the team that picks last. unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair."
43549,Sheldon,it says here you’re a chemist. which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?
35800,Sheldon,"ooh, i don’t think so. no, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. i suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-spock."
37991,Sheldon,i’m behind you. please look at me when you’re talking to me.
42967,Sheldon,"okay, that’s great. now, let it go."
40849,Sheldon,that’s because he drinks too much soy milk.
41455,Sheldon,"well, can you believe she said i embarrassed her?"
42300,Sheldon,"hello, leonard."
44226,Sheldon,you got emotional when that lab monkey died.
44536,Sheldon,"we don’t need howard’s cousin. no, we have me. "
41443,Sheldon,"so, goofing off. as i was saying, i’m done with work and leonard’s not. so good news, you get to take me home. play your cards right, i’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night."
38599,Sheldon,how?
43840,Sheldon,"i’m, i’m sorry; i didn’t realize you were on a date."
42612,Sheldon,"i was, but penny didn’t want to. you didn’t want to. bernadette, amy, koothrappali and wolowitz didn’t want to. and even i knew it was weird to hire somebody."
38351,Sheldon,"yes, you are. i’m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns."
37869,Sheldon,"in a few minutes, when i gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer i do it? the standard i told you so? the classic neener-neener? or just my normal look of haughty derision?"
43850,Sheldon,"and you do realize i bought my ticket when amy and i were broken up? i hope you didn’t need anything in that case, ’cause it’s closed."
45565,Sheldon,"and get this, i saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain."
42443,Sheldon,hello.
44438,Sheldon,you would do that?
39103,Sheldon,yellow. go ahead.
36191,Sheldon,is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
40504,Sheldon,"on the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman."
41818,Sheldon,how do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the comic-con police?
44143,Sheldon,surprise.
39735,Sheldon,"fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, oregon. oh, look. hello, mr. beaver. in future episodes, we’ll answer some burning questions. what’s the only non-rectangular flag? what animal appears most often on flags? what animal appears second most often on flags? and more."
41651,Sheldon,"hello, president siebert. thank you for taking my call. i just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. oh, no, no, no, no. no need to thank mno, thank my friend, wil wheaton. for your information, i have nine friends, hmm? ten if we include you. nine it is. ah, it’s ten. i’ll count wolowitz. hello, friend leonard."
36674,Sheldon,fed.
37708,Sheldon,"no. i mean, i have no idea what you smell."
36763,Sheldon,"easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. we then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. next we look at…"
43173,Sheldon,"all right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse’s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed."
37023,Sheldon,"that doesn’t mean one won’t be in another, especially if i’m driving."
38011,Sheldon,greetings. you all remember amy farrah fowler.
38353,Sheldon,it’s for howard.
42504,Sheldon,i don’t think it worked.
40073,Sheldon,"well, i believe i’ve done it. and i’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet sam houston, i did it."
42853,Sheldon,"yeah, well, then do it."
34734,Sheldon,the resemblance is remarkable. i can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair. 
40897,Sheldon,yeah. okay. stop ruining valentine’s day and order my pizza.
36056,Sheldon,"too bad. if it’d been a friend, i’m available to fill the void.  it’s just as well, she smelled like moth balls."
41925,Sheldon,wait. you were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?
38781,Sheldon,right. i’ll make tea.
45278,Sheldon,"i realize it’s irrational, but with raj moving in there, i’m feeling a bit replaced."
44347,Sheldon,"it’s not always because they die. in one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. yeah, but i won’t say who it is. it’s brann."
41580,Sheldon,yeah. it’s great you’re here. i’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.
42084,Sheldon,your failed attempt to go back to college?
41741,Sheldon,brain lesions!
39097,Sheldon,i’m working on my three-person chess game.
45487,Sheldon,"well, it is. if i wanted to hold three things at once, i’d wear cargo pants."
39031,Sheldon,"it’s talc. but as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder, i understand your confusion."
36629,Sheldon,what are we having?
35902,Sheldon,"oh, hi stephanie."
45260,Sheldon,"that’s very kind of you, stuart. check back in with me in july."
43504,Sheldon,"leonard, don’t be fooled. i’m from texas, me-hi-co is spanish for mexico."
37433,Sheldon,"great. i’ll start packing. in a minute.  oh, look, it’s the cholermus."
42168,Sheldon,"you know what this is? yeah, and i reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. this is malarkey."
41411,Sheldon,"well, why wouldn’t i be?"
39198,Sheldon,irrelevant. rajesh and i have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it.  what are you doing here?
35613,Sheldon,"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! oh god, not euclid avenue! aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
42748,Sheldon,"that’s right. so stay on my good side, or i’ll get you a little something, too."
44123,Sheldon,and can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
36255,Sheldon,i forgot my flash drive.
41419,Sheldon,why? so you can see the look on amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?
45615,Sheldon,"this is dr sheldon cooper. yeah, i need to cancel my membership to the planetarium. yeah, well i’m sorry too, but there’s just no room for you in my wallet. yeah, i understand, but it was between you and the museum of natural history and, frankly, you don’t have dinosaurs. well i’ll miss you too, bye bye. okay, i know you’re texting about me, and i’d really like you to stop."
36460,Sheldon,"so, i win."
38384,Sheldon,of what? poorly executed beards?
45590,Sheldon,of course.
41693,Sheldon,"oh, no, thank you, i don’t want to be an inconvenience. chop-chop, leonard. we leave in ten minutes."
43256,Sheldon,"well, well, well, did you hear that, howard?"
44164,Sheldon,"i don’t know. i looked around the room, and i saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much."
37657,Sheldon,"be the ball, howard."
41742,Sheldon,or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
36476,Sheldon,"do you know, i’m such a good mood, i’m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the english language folksy and charming today."
40484,Sheldon,you’re just repeating what i said. it’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
36490,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, that’s not going to interest me at all, just eat."
36756,Sheldon,that doesn’t seem likely. her bed’s of sturdy construction. even the addition
34942,Sheldon,vaporub makes my hands smell funny. 
42671,Sheldon,i do. and i wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and i wasn’t at his bedside to say i told you so.
41291,Sheldon,"uh, elephant?"
36739,Sheldon,of course i’m right what are the odds i’d be wrong twice in one week?
42448,Sheldon,i have some odd freckles on my buttocks. can i make an appointment for you to look at them?
35363,Sheldon,i drank milk that tasted funny. 
45818,Sheldon,thank you. i just want to say i’m a big fan. you’re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.
37411,Sheldon,"i do. it fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. but you like it, and you’re my friend."
42996,Sheldon,"well, as a texas gentleman, i’m inclined to say ladies first. although, i’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. perhaps we should flip a coin. or if you’re familiar with the rules of rock, paper, scissors…"
42131,Sheldon,i don’t know. what do you want to do?
43548,Sheldon,i appreciate your interest in the apartment. i just need to ask you a few standard questions.
38971,Sheldon,now i’m thinking about jell-o.
38586,Sheldon,is it better than your idea to move to los angeles and become a famous actress?
37765,Sheldon,"well, she doesn’t care for hotels. and who can blame her? windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. all right, i believe i have time for one more question. yes, raj?"
41779,Sheldon,leonard told me to stay.
38942,Sheldon,of course.
45020,Sheldon,why would you do that?
40900,Sheldon,"yeah. well, you came to the right place."
41096,Sheldon,and you just got yourself uninvited. see? i told you i’d find a tactful way to do that.
44673,Sheldon,does stephen hawking roll through the quad?
41268,Sheldon,"uh, stuart, i was wondering if you could help me find something."
38440,Sheldon,because you keep saying who.
39015,Sheldon,"do so, do so."
34751,Sheldon,"no, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet. "
43099,Sheldon,you know how the pennysaver only has my name…
36298,Sheldon,"obviously, not a cleaning business."
43712,Sheldon,"no, not at all. no, i’m fine. you know, amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best."
44990,Sheldon,"amy, i just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. if that’s not foreplay, i don’t know what is."
39981,Sheldon,just tell her i can’t come.
37168,Sheldon,i understand. you dispute newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put gottfried leibniz on the top.
35533,Sheldon,i sense you’re trying to tell me something.
37496,Sheldon,"this is stan lee’s front door. we were on stan lee’s curb, then we were on stan lee’s walk, and now we’re at stan lee’s front door."
44136,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. and if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them."
44785,Sheldon,but that’s my room.
35083,Sheldon,need you ask? but i still don’t understand why no-one else bid. 
35755,Sheldon,who touched my…
45282,Sheldon,"it’s nothing like that. i just, i thought about raj’s situation, and i had a change of heart. you know, and regarding your gift, you said surprise me, and, boy, did i. hello."
44205,Sheldon,are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘cause i did not l-l-see that coming.
45317,Sheldon,"amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and i realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. now, i recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you googling what it means, so i’ll wait."
40844,Sheldon,"hello, home wrecker."
38767,Sheldon,would you be sleeping over again this evening? because you’re welcome to.
45315,Sheldon,"gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon."
41745,Sheldon,ointment?
38760,Sheldon,did you offer him a hot beverage?
41043,Sheldon,"okay, because that was not clear."
43141,Sheldon,"and rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. um, noise-cancelling headphones. oh, danger whistle. um, pepper spray. ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. uh, let’s see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. oh, and a mirror on a stick, so i can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn’t some kind of weirdo."
42256,Sheldon,what do you mean?
35448,Sheldon,there there.  would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
41114,Sheldon,"well, how can you say that? professor proton’s the best."
44558,Sheldon,"look, i’m sorry. tell me why bernadette is upset with you."
37192,Sheldon,that’s not the comforting part.
38577,Sheldon,"so, your project is more important than mine?"
41521,Sheldon,"no, no, no. i’m really good at this. all right, give me a hint. does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?"
42779,Sheldon,"you’re making it too complicated. why not stick to the basics? go shopping for clothes while leonard and i sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? i know i’d hate that. leonard?"
38512,Sheldon,i’m kermit. you’re scooter.
44995,Sheldon,"well, we were on our way to my mother’s house…"
35134,Sheldon,thank you for coming by.  hello.
39819,Sheldon,uh-huh. and an irrational constant.
36079,Sheldon,"yeah, i don’t think i can."
35588,Sheldon,"but i don’t drive, and i can’t take the bus."
45607,Sheldon,"you’re not swelling, howard."
38865,Sheldon,as you wish.  did you pick one?
35169,Sheldon,how so?
35701,Sheldon,"i don’t know, but apparently i’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them."
43607,Sheldon,"excuse me. i’m recovering from a recent breakup, and i’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. and as ash ketchum said to pikachu, i choose you."
43154,Sheldon,well then i hate it. music should just be fun.
40998,Sheldon,i would like to change mine. the pirate’s name was peg-leg antoine. now it’s completely different from goonies.
34908,Sheldon,at six-thirty in the morning? 
42266,Sheldon,"yeah, and on top of that, leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more."
38740,Sheldon,"penny, you’re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this."
44449,Sheldon,but then each of those people let someone cut?
45478,Sheldon,are you sure? ‘cause i’m feeling a twinge.
41255,Sheldon,"hmm. a while back, youtube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. i tell people i’m okay with it, but i’m really not."
37809,Sheldon,"dr. plimpton, i’d like you to meet my colleagues, dr. rajesh koothrappali"
34683,Sheldon,you go dancing every wednesday.
44313,Sheldon,"oh, uh, never have i ever put my foot in the ocean."
38021,Sheldon,"i know what your point is. you’re intimidated by amy’s intellect. to that i say, buck up."
39019,Sheldon,this isn’t over.
41719,Sheldon,"to quote han solo, i know."
37380,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i don’t work here.
44423,Sheldon,"oh, easy, bill nye the science guy."
41793,Sheldon,i’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
38516,Sheldon,thank you! thank you so much!
40019,Sheldon,"i think i understand. you’re the one person who can say sheldon cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. i forget what i bring to the party and what i take away when i leave. please accept these valuable cooper coupons as restitution."
40732,Sheldon,"oh, they shot a lot of star trek episodes out there."
34214,Sheldon,"no, that was the result of my work with lasers."
43318,Sheldon,"what did they feed the lions, mother?"
36801,Sheldon,"hi, leonard. hello, raj."
35241,Sheldon,"yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password. "
40038,Sheldon,oh dear lord. no!
39722,Sheldon,leonard will be here in a moment. he’s looking for a different parking space.
41026,Sheldon,barely knew him.
42118,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord. where’s amy?"
44545,Sheldon,you don’t need him. i’ll represent you.
41590,Sheldon,"oh, not necessarily. i suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in armenia or lebanon."
45177,Sheldon,he’s not gonna make it.
43886,Sheldon,"thank you, arthur. you are the wisest of the wise."
38460,Sheldon,what insult?
42307,Sheldon,"excuse me, officer hernandez? any leads on the person who stole my belongings?"
36373,Sheldon,hello.
36770,Sheldon,did you? i didn’t notice. have a chocolate.
43452,Sheldon,you know what? she was kind of an honorary man. she had a penis made of science.
42063,Sheldon,"well, yeah, okay, sure. but which one?"
35222,Sheldon,what do you think.
43224,Sheldon,we built a fort.
37080,Sheldon,i was humiliated on national radio. how do you think i’m doing?
34871,Sheldon,"great, what is it?"
41960,Sheldon,"oh, in that case, i’d like to be partnered with my good friend howard."
44279,Sheldon,"oh, it’s car air freshener. i was simulating the smell of the forest."
43697,Sheldon,i have many. my most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend penny. that’s her over there.
39670,Sheldon,amy had a fight. i was being perfectly reasonable. i’m gonna have a whiskey. do you want anything?
40150,Sheldon,you know germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.
45316,Sheldon,"yeah, i picked it up without thinking about it. which raises a neuroscientific question, when did i decide to pick it up?"
36157,Sheldon,of course. i would very much like to read about your sex life.
35617,Sheldon,you want to go to pottery barn first?
45453,Sheldon,"ooh, we already have our first call."
41799,Sheldon,penny?
36886,Sheldon,silence!
38523,Sheldon,howard doesn’t. he’s only an engineer.
41828,Sheldon,"thank you. my friend leonard said if i bothered you while you were eating, you’d think i was a creepy stalker."
44461,Sheldon,i most certainly did not.
34384,Sheldon,"well, i don’t think you have a shot there. i have noticed that lesley winkle recently started shaving her legs. now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability. "
43373,Sheldon,okay. if you say so.
40808,Sheldon,can we get back to work?
44354,Sheldon,fair enough.
38741,Sheldon,but we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
43888,Sheldon, birthday girl.
41010,Sheldon,pchew! pchew! pchew! pchew!
45350,Sheldon,"name calling, that is perfect. now, when i get to this equation here, really let me have it. you know? if it helps, i’m not the sharpest dresser."
45808,Sheldon,"hello, professor hoskins. nice to see you, mindy. konichi-wa dr. nakamora. sorry the swedes disproved your theory. leonard, my door."
45363,Sheldon,"oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk."
41439,Sheldon,"it’s a physical relationship, too. hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. ow. okay, here’s a new one. apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. how do you like it when i do it to you? not so much, huh?"
42091,Sheldon,"yes. as it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. anyway, it suggests that i set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in east texas."
34688,Sheldon,"it’s the chinese restaurant all over again. i assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman."
41941,Sheldon,i have an eidetic memory. i don’t know what his problem is.
36766,Sheldon,you said be nice to penny. i believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
41199,Sheldon,it did not kill me when you went to space. monkeys went to space.
44146,Sheldon,"fine. as you know, i have a twin sister with whom i obviously share a birthday. every year we’d have a party. no one i invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me."
36005,Sheldon,what do you mean?
45354,Sheldon,"yeah, that list is strong. like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors."
45485,Sheldon,i’m returning this stuff to howard.
45052,Sheldon,"amy is free. she had a harp lesson on saturday but it got cancelled. boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense. "
37127,Sheldon,come in. take a seat. subject has arrived. i’ve extended a friendly casual greeting.
42731,Sheldon,"you told me not to call, and i didn’t know how else to give you the good news. fun with flags is back, and you can be in the next episode."
40696,Sheldon,let’s not call it a problem. let’s call it an opportunity. to solve a serious problem.
40379,Sheldon,darts is a bar game. you’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
40498,Sheldon,"the trouble isn’t with me, penny, it’s with your gender. someday, scientists will discover that second x chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle."
38758,Sheldon,another compliment! learn to recognize them.
37611,Sheldon,"not literally. but as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels."
36783,Sheldon,"oh, come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend."
34444,Sheldon,i need eggs. four dozen should suffice.
34863,Sheldon,good for you. 
35847,Sheldon,no.
41403,Sheldon,"fine. i’m mad at you. not only did you ruin raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it."
36271,Sheldon,i’m not in san francisco. i’m on a train. were you even listening to me?
42363,Sheldon,"no, it’s fine. now i can devote all my time to dark matter."
39145,Sheldon,"regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. what’s more likely going to kill howard’s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital."
44752,Sheldon,so?
39237,Sheldon,don’t you like amy?
36940,Sheldon,i can see that. i was providing you with an alternative. a courtesy i was never offered in similar circumstances.
43343,Sheldon,"well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. or train a rat."
44107,Sheldon,"when, when we were apart, i learned how important you are to me. and i realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…"
45071,Sheldon,"hello, amy. it’s nice to see you."
34793,Sheldon,"you continue to underestimate me, my good man. "
37679,Sheldon,"or fornication. yeah. but that has judgmental overtones, so i’ll hold that in reserve."
34231,Sheldon,"well, today we tried masturbating for money."
36246,Sheldon,"unlikely. that’s a television show, leonard."
40870,Sheldon,"so, in conclusion, i believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste."
41224,Sheldon,"well, i try."
35486,Sheldon,"hello. penny, this is not a good time. no, i told you, you’re not prepared for the sanctum of burning souls. you need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. penny, i can’t log on and help you. we’ll talk when i get home.  i’m not getting the computing time, am i?"
39775,Sheldon,"yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares."
34625,Sheldon,8:08
44355,Sheldon,"well, the important thing is i said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and i was right."
38334,Sheldon,ah. blame president james “jimmy” carter. he started america on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. he wonders why he was a one-term president.
35853,Sheldon,"anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival."
42453,Sheldon,"so, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?"
41339,Sheldon,yeah.
35032,Sheldon,what do manners have to do with it? this is war. were the romans polite when they salted the ground of carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
45232,Sheldon,she’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.
43794,Sheldon,"you know, for a thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad."
37070,Sheldon,"thank you. my mother is very excited. she’s convening her bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul."
34506,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll have the barbecue burger. "
36321,Sheldon,you’re questioning my math?
38120,Sheldon,"well, the status is as it always was. she’s a girl. she’s a friend. she is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend."
40871,Sheldon,"oh, you caught that, did you?"
44773,Sheldon,"wait, uh, you saw her apartment?"
37956,Sheldon,i was going to. i planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
34879,Sheldon,"unfortunately, we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab. "
37700,Sheldon,i can’t think of a reason why not.
44564,Sheldon,impressive.
41937,Sheldon,"no, thanks. we’re fine. i mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that’s what you should do. i like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things. but if those days are gone, they’re gone. it just makes me sad."
44859,Sheldon,who listens to the radio any more?
43512,Sheldon,"i usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. however, even i must admit feeling richard feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing."
45715,Sheldon,good lord! would you stop that caterwauling!
39790,Sheldon,"can’t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? i see where your therapist was coming from."
40275,Sheldon,i think i might have tartar buildup. my tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to.
38157,Sheldon,wait. what?
39550,Sheldon,"the question is moot. there is no way that stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to amy farrah fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia."
39501,Sheldon,"very well. oh, boy. "
36496,Sheldon,"hmm, i see."
44187,Sheldon,that’s outrageous. this is our idea based on our research. how can you possibly justify owning a majority share?
37661,Sheldon,did you let wil wheaton get in your head?
40351,Sheldon,"welcome aboard, old chum."
41992,Sheldon,no. i wanted to surprise her. what am i supposed to say to her after something like this?
41250,Sheldon,i own nine pairs of pants.
42357,Sheldon,"a valid point, but unoriginal. b-minus."
39034,Sheldon,thank you. not necessary. we know everything there is to know about kissing. it requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
34505,Sheldon,"excuse me, in a world that already includes the big boy, why would i settle for something like a big boy?"
40825,Sheldon,one star trek: the next generation phaser. that’s leonard’s.
36771,Sheldon,"and it’s not a cartoon, it’s anime."
41974,Sheldon,because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. aren’t you going to let me out?
40059,Sheldon,"perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular nebraska man-hands."
38897,Sheldon,"you know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?"
38377,Sheldon,this is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped for dinner. this is where we could have been if koothrappali hadn’t ordered dessert.
41376,Sheldon,"hey, that’s my shirt."
36679,Sheldon,thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
39543,Sheldon,"how could he do this to me? get back here, you stupid bird, so i can love you!"
41190,Sheldon,i’m not jealous. i’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
45752,Sheldon,"are you mad at me? oh, no, you’re mad at me. i’m so sorry. beep bop boop bop."
44426,Sheldon,"oh, bad news. amy’s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go."
34556,Sheldon,"no, i want to talk about the fact that wolowitz shot me in the back. "
41563,Sheldon,i seem to be a few tickets short. are there more in the box?
41900,Sheldon,"you know, i’d love to, but, um, i’m too busy falling back in love with windows 98."
39879,Sheldon,fine. sorry.
36915,Sheldon,the line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
44893,Sheldon,"rock, rock, water fountain. i am not proud of this, but i have been envious of your recent success."
40509,Sheldon,wouldn’t you like to know?
37144,Sheldon,all right. it’s a warm summer evening in ancient greece…
43421,Sheldon,"fine, i guess i’m stuck with raj."
39983,Sheldon,"amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way."
42020,Sheldon,hello.
42416,Sheldon,"leonard, i assumed you knew. the ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and amy, howard and bernadette, raj and his girlfriend, penny and chardonnay, penny and you."
41423,Sheldon,"now, don’t be insulted. he just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious. "
44464,Sheldon,"no, i could’ve done more."
39247,Sheldon,i’ve been sitting in garbage!
43910,Sheldon,i’m glad to see you made it safely. how’s your hotel?
36620,Sheldon,"assuming that’s a valid reason not to go, which it isn’t, how do you know this? did she say it?"
39767,Sheldon,"of course i can. it’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, i thought i got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to mexico."
41603,Sheldon,yes.
35039,Sheldon,why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?
35906,Sheldon,"yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. i’m not strong enough, leonard, you’ll have to do it."
44180,Sheldon,thank you so much. i can’t believe you’re…
36090,Sheldon,"yeah. shoulda, woulda coulda, raj."
43786,Sheldon,i’m sensing things have gotten awkward.
43631,Sheldon,"he said be honest, so i was honest. didn’t your mother tell you? it’s the best policy. so, what do you say?"
36043,Sheldon,how could i not?
44203,Sheldon,i wonder what they’re talking about.
40300,Sheldon,penny?
41794,Sheldon,too bad. it seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.
38079,Sheldon,"you’re wrong again. if my superpower were arrogance, my name would be dr. arroganto."
35962,Sheldon,where were you that’s more important than wii bowling night?
36977,Sheldon,of course not. i’ll have my usual.
38074,Sheldon,would you like to see my cats?
45616,Sheldon,hello penny.  
42570,Sheldon,that’s humorous.
40776,Sheldon,very well.
43459,Sheldon,i will tell you what is happening. i am saving my best friend’s marriage.
40780,Sheldon,"i read his research, and, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as i had thought. it’s his mommy."
40180,Sheldon,"well, seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock."
44687,Sheldon,i know. sometimes i would just like to be appreciated for my mind.
39808,Sheldon,and how would i do that?
35250,Sheldon,"okay, where were we? "
42601,Sheldon, penny?
41932,Sheldon,"yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship."
37257,Sheldon,"you know, the more i think about it, the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster."
42006,Sheldon,"and of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?"
42348,Sheldon,"that’s the one. i believe you went last, so, uh, please?"
35497,Sheldon,"yeah, yeah, enough debate, i’m going to take action.  excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?"
34649,Sheldon,"he’s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. it’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and i do not appreciate it. "
36422,Sheldon,i think you mean comic books. comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
34401,Sheldon,"perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of aramis to dissipate. "
36837,Sheldon,caca?
36010,Sheldon,you are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify monte so that he’s prepared.
37714,Sheldon,"oh, yes. in fact, he said, i’m fine, i don’t care. and he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal."
35557,Sheldon,thank you.
44496,Sheldon,very well.
45619,Sheldon,"penny! penny, i’m hungry. "
43286,Sheldon,yay.
35146,Sheldon,and don’t ever call me shelly.
35161,Sheldon,"i don’t understand. yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways. "
41068,Sheldon,"oh, that’s nonsense. i mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. i don’t care how they end."
39229,Sheldon,"all right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. i suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. but if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, hey, leonard, how was your dinfast with priya last night?"
42078,Sheldon,i couldn’t sleep.
42435,Sheldon,whoa. nobody said anything about watching the game.
41684,Sheldon,"well, that seems like a snooze. even for public radio."
37881,Sheldon,yes?  peace?
42993,Sheldon,"okay, babe, let’s do this."
40361,Sheldon,it’s a quark-gluon plasma.
39469,Sheldon,we are?
37754,Sheldon,"that’s what typhoid mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled."
43310,Sheldon,"initiate landing sequence. initiate landing sequence. hey, the camera’s working. oh, look, it’s me."
45305,Sheldon,yes. i don’t care for unconscious thoughts. my brain and i are best friends. it should tell me everything. 
35022,Sheldon,"point of order. i move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. no man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant. "
38189,Sheldon,why would i change?
44747,Sheldon,"dr. fowler and i began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. this is our friend penny’s place. you may remember her from our episode, flags and the people who don’t understand them."
34233,Sheldon,"yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. that part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the bourne-oppenheimer approximation."
35204,Sheldon,in addition i really don’t think that leonard wants a…
37193,Sheldon,"no, no. the comforting part is that the germans have a term for what you’re feeling. weltschmerz. it means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world."
35073,Sheldon,absolutely.
43611,Sheldon,i smell funny. i taste salty.
39006,Sheldon,what?
41920,Sheldon," amy? i’ll get right to the point. i think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don’t cry on my ipad, i didn’t get applecare."
42276,Sheldon,and you couldn’t put it out?
35897,Sheldon,may i come in?
40441,Sheldon,"i humiliated stephen hawking in a game of words with friends. he stopped playing, and now we’re not friends anymore."
35123,Sheldon,"i’ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is. "
41717,Sheldon,you okay?
36979,Sheldon,yes.
43042,Sheldon,do you want to say it?
41344,Sheldon,i’m sorry. are we really doing this or are we tricking koothrappali again like with the dinner party?
45556,Sheldon,you know you just split an infinitive.
36418,Sheldon,"last night was wednesday. wednesday is comic book night. tonight, we’ll be going on thursday, because it’s anything can happen thursday."
37660,Sheldon,"thank you, jesus! as my mother would say."
37770,Sheldon,"i want her to feel at home. i also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel."
39556,Sheldon,"am i okay? leonard, i’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a nobel prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a german train schedule. am i okay?"
40688,Sheldon,"no, uh, no, i’m sorry. who’s talking about leonard and alex?"
40733,Sheldon,"oh, smashing. now, leonard, do you know how to get there?"
39841,Sheldon,"now you do, too. oh! i have a brilliant idea. amy’s a biologist. i’ll go work in her lab."
44917,Sheldon,"wonderful, longclaw is mine. and how about you keep our avocado plant?"
35787,Sheldon,"i am meeting you halfway, i’m willing to concede that you’ve done some stupid things."
36719,Sheldon,obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
45723,Sheldon,cherry stem! cherry stem!
45771,Sheldon,"hello, yes, i was hoping you could help me. what song is this? la, la, la, la, la, la, la. you don’t know? well, how dare you call yourselves a rock and roll hall of fame? my goodness. do you sing along to the greatest hits of elvis presley with that mouth? well, they were no help at all."
37125,Sheldon,"not likely. koko learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes."
41363,Sheldon,the next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.
43636,Sheldon,four questions. there answer’s four.
37465,Sheldon,"raj? you’ll be there, won’t you?  all right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. so, i guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness."
36558,Sheldon,perhaps you mean a different thing than i do when you say science.
35371,Sheldon,you’re wearing modern underwear?
39508,Sheldon,"leonard, be glad you can’t keep a woman. they are a handful."
45386,Sheldon,"at, at the lab? why am i naked from the waist down?"
43775,Sheldon,and there goes my list.
36922,Sheldon,fine.
45119,Sheldon,he’s still mad.
43667,Sheldon,she said buenas noches. what was he supposed to do?
45694,Sheldon,"nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen. glory, hallelujah."
40292,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. yeah, pick one, your choice."
36510,Sheldon,i’m homesick.
38400,Sheldon,why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?
35932,Sheldon,"hmm, yes, you did. now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. in the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. third,the bathroom schedule. now, i’m given to understand women have different needs, so, we’ll have to discuss that."
44590,Sheldon,"you want to bet? oh, great, now i’m addicted to gambling."
44106,Sheldon,yes. i believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.
45625,Sheldon,gentlemen.
42352,Sheldon,you people are sick.
35380,Sheldon,"hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person."
45452,Sheldon,"based on the glowing reception of our recent behind the flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together. "
36266,Sheldon,penny would have to go into my room.
45289,Sheldon,i thought that was gonna break the other way.
44185,Sheldon,that’s great.
35381,Sheldon,"well, if you’ll excuse me, i’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. yeah, you heard me."
34599,Sheldon,"oh, snap. so i guess we’ll be leaving now. "
37769,Sheldon,i have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
34887,Sheldon,"obviously you’re not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed. "
38141,Sheldon,you’re welcome. but it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
37589,Sheldon,"i recently had a dream that i was a giant. but everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal."
39138,Sheldon,"interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?"
36929,Sheldon,how would you put it?
41907,Sheldon,"well, that means not one, or not any. maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. well, i don’t know if i won that, but at least he’s upset."
35434,Sheldon,look on the bright side.
42404,Sheldon,"well, not just him. may i remind you that you’re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place griffith park quidditch team."
41065,Sheldon,"oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. and after that, i’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. you know, instead of flossing, i’ll rub pudding on my gums. i’m going to get the number of the syfy channel and give them what for."
35278,Sheldon,"no. that’s mrs grossinger. and she doesn’t have a cat, she has a mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip…"
36046,Sheldon,what hope do i have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
43398,Sheldon,"no, of course not. they thrive on our suffering."
44198,Sheldon,you bet i did.
43620,Sheldon,thanks. and i taste good too.
36597,Sheldon,yes.
35382,Sheldon,great news. my mom sent me my old nintendo 64.
44286,Sheldon,"excuse me. here, look up fun, get back to me."
40845,Sheldon,"you gave leonard somewhere to go. thanks to you, amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels. like i’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it."
44167,Sheldon,"based on this pep talk, i’d say you’re still doing it."
43640,Sheldon,it’s like it was yesterday.
45088,Sheldon,what? he said he was fine.
44357,Sheldon, leonard.
43915,Sheldon,"aw, you always know just what to say after i tell you what to say."
42904,Sheldon,come on. click the mouse with me.
38640,Sheldon,i guess not.
40542,Sheldon,"if a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. however, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. so, like a zombie, that’s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on."
38291,Sheldon,"correct. now to business. 18 years ago, i sent the fbi crime lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and dna analysis. why haven’t i heard back yet?"
39882,Sheldon,"mm, indeed."
40143,Sheldon,"oh, no, no, no, of course not. it’s just, i was thinking… oh, gosh, golly, i made a boo-boo, and i gave it to stephen hawking."
34269,Sheldon,technically that would be coitus interruptus.
41428,Sheldon,"well, then, you have my permission."
38575,Sheldon,"playing it. i’ve loved the theremin from the first moment i heard the original star trek theme. and it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust."
38470,Sheldon,are you sure this is what you want to do?
42344,Sheldon,it was like the rest of the class wanted ms. mcdonald to forget the quiz.
34525,Sheldon,"no, no, wait, hold on. "
42991,Sheldon,"uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or pope."
43139,Sheldon,"yeah, i think so. i just restocked the old prk."
43634,Sheldon,where does he work?
39560,Sheldon,"all right, fine. let’s just play."
39221,Sheldon,"wait. i just want you all to know that i forgive you. this mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. i haven’t earned these bars. although what i lack in leadership, apparently i more than make up for in sewing."
36312,Sheldon,of course i could.
37598,Sheldon,"oh, dear."
45270,Sheldon,i suppose that’s acceptable.
35288,Sheldon,"ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion. "
37971,Sheldon,"so this is how it ends, with cruel irony. just as i make the commitment to preserving my body, i am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. do you know the original purpose of the appendix, leonard?"
37452,Sheldon,"november 16? penny, that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and i had to drive you to the emergency room."
35200,Sheldon,"i hardly think so, leonard made it very clear he doesn’t want a party."
41913,Sheldon,"i have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals."
45180,Sheldon,he’s not gonna make it.
43824,Sheldon,"dear crazy future sheldon, this is a thermostat. it controls the temperature of the apartment. the ideal setting is 72 degrees. if you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. a straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. now, this is your spot. you’re very protective of it. when anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. it sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. people are also delighted by your love of pranks. for example, leonard has no idea what i did to his coffee. it wasn’t replace it with folger’s crystals, i’ll tell you that much."
37812,Sheldon,let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
38295,Sheldon,"you heard me say blu-ray, right?"
36259,Sheldon,then i won’t get to see his face light up as he reads it.
36112,Sheldon,don’t you need money?
38187,Sheldon,amusing. a play on the two meanings of cobbler.
38073,Sheldon,"done. you understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?"
42716,Sheldon,"you do this, i delete your contact information."
36410,Sheldon,only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
44346,Sheldon,gladly.
43478,Sheldon,"now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as i see it, there’s a simple solution."
39273,Sheldon,"all right, name your price."
39709,Sheldon,i was using the bathroom.
35610,Sheldon,"no, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is from work."
43111,Sheldon,well then what if i told you that i added your name to the cable bill?
40205,Sheldon,"thank you for the invitation, but i have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something i’ll enjoy."
37347,Sheldon,your cell phone was off.
44240,Sheldon,"oh. uh, no, no, no, thank you."
40202,Sheldon,"289, right between the game show network at 288 and the east coast feed of the disney channel on 290."
35868,Sheldon,"no, i didn’t try, i succeeded. in fact, i was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, snowball, before he caught fire. it led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner."
39842,Sheldon,"ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. now you’re an expert."
35803,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but i’m not going to watch the clone wars tv series until i’ve seen the clone wars movie. i prefer to let george lucas disappoint me in the order he intended."
45261,Sheldon,there’s my pretty girlfriend.
39033,Sheldon,"other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. but in the interest of full disclosure, i was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. every year i get a christmas card from her, signed with far too many x’s and o’s."
40237,Sheldon,"yes, it is. there’s a loophole in the relationship agreement."
38524,Sheldon,"you know, leonard, that’s actually a valid idea. very good."
44225,Sheldon,you’re too late.
41789,Sheldon,why do you ask?
39809,Sheldon,every time?
43292,Sheldon,not very.
39337,Sheldon,it’s part of my sword collection. do you have a sword collection?
45314,Sheldon,"well, what do you know? here i was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle."
38421,Sheldon,clarify something for me. isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? an opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
44651,Sheldon,"now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but i am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep."
37643,Sheldon,"oh, i think we both know the answer to that question."
43299,Sheldon,"very impressive. you know, when you’re done with that, can you look at this? it doesn’t make smoke anymore."
42196,Sheldon,why are you here?
34449,Sheldon,"no it doesn’t. not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved. "
38949,Sheldon,hysterical.
45342,Sheldon,"hold on. i see what’s wrong here. we did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex."
40837,Sheldon,"hey, good buddy. so, uh, i was just talking to amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing."
21834,Sheldon,what is going on here?
37527,Sheldon,no! i call no meemaws.
39432,Sheldon,"what are you trying to pull, mom? from the top."
39380,Sheldon,there’s a lot of harm in trying something new. that’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
36345,Sheldon,"excuse me, but was this not your goal? financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? my brilliance and innovation, of course, but still."
41767,Sheldon,"oh, this again? so, penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. how does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?"
44156,Sheldon,oh. thank you.
39316,Sheldon,"okay, get this. it doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the koothrappalis are vastly wealthy."
44349,Sheldon,"well, i’ll catch you up. uh, penny is angry at leonard, leonard’s angry at me and penny, i’m angry at leonard and amy, raj is angry at howard, and i’m angry at george r.r. martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for leonard."
34499,Sheldon,is dr gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
43641,Sheldon,of course i do. i don’t want that swedish team scooping us.
36946,Sheldon,"your turn, leonard."
42905,Sheldon,"yes, we did, my friend."
38911,Sheldon,and people think i don’t get sarcasm.
35682,Sheldon,"oh, great. she’s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me."
43601,Sheldon,"that is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. if you’re worth your salt as an instructor, i should be ready by then. yeah, and be warned. i’m going to touch you all over."
38747,Sheldon,"oh, come on! why not?"
42519,Sheldon,no.
40015,Sheldon,"dr. rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. in the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go."
38243,Sheldon,"you mean, you want me to keep a secret."
42447,Sheldon,"oh, i like their emergency room. yeah, even if it turns out you don’t have dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop."
35799,Sheldon,in what sense is that a compromise?
40961,Sheldon,"well, now don’t you feel silly."
41686,Sheldon,"oh, i would, but i’m on my way out."
40328,Sheldon,"now, are you sure? everyone’s smoking them. i think they’re the best."
42119,Sheldon,"oh. i should call her and apologize. oh, no."
45343,Sheldon,"oh, that is much better. yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we’d be in good shape."
40296,Sheldon,excuse me. this is not about protecting my friend. i’m a big fan of homeostasis. do you know what that is?
43618,Sheldon,"interesting. i asked two women out today, and they both said no."
38250,Sheldon,"i know, that’s why i shortened it."
39062,Sheldon,"affirmative. computer, this is dr. sheldon cooper. activate self-destruct sequence. code 1-1-a-2-b."
38284,Sheldon,i suppose i could if i were asked.
40787,Sheldon,"oh, don’t play the einstein card. his great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. so everything was a great breakthrough."
42163,Sheldon,"okay, i just did. what was it?"
40848,Sheldon,"hold on. if you don’t want to live with leonard, why don’t you just tell him?"
40949,Sheldon,all your ideas address the issue at a university level. by then it’s too late. you need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
44424,Sheldon,creepy old dude from dancing with the stars.
34216,Sheldon,"two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is."
43195,Sheldon,"i guess news travels fast. it’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of richard feynman, and i wasn’t included."
40679,Sheldon,"jenga, i win!"
38561,Sheldon,"oh, i know. i’m now an independent contractor."
34346,Sheldon,"if you have time to lean, you have time to clean."
37778,Sheldon,i apologize. he’s only an experimental physicist.
44537,Sheldon,i am not a know-it-all. i’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong.
37342,Sheldon,but i’m still working.
40353,Sheldon,"you know, i am very disappointed that i won’t be able to celebrate howard’s accomplishment tonight."
34752,Sheldon,"someone in sezchuan province, china is using his computer to turn our lights on and off. "
38445,Sheldon,hang on. i don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
36935,Sheldon,"you shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures."
34317,Sheldon,"yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring."
42584,Sheldon,"oh, please, you know, i’ll tell you how he did it. implacable, relentless badgering. in urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. and she was a urethra that could not shake him."
42990,Sheldon,yes.
38934,Sheldon,can i at least kick down the door?
34335,Sheldon,no?
39619,Sheldon,my point.
45248,Sheldon,"well, if you haven’t noticed, i’ve been between them for the last ten years."
43852,Sheldon,"arthur, what brings you back?"
43008,Sheldon,i don’t think you’re taking this seriously.
43692,Sheldon,"oh, it’s nice to meet you. i admire your father’s work very much. it’s not every day i get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum."
42765,Sheldon,what colour would you like to be?
36608,Sheldon,"gentlemen, use your imagination. innovate. did han solo let luke skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of hoth? no. he cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up."
39315,Sheldon,"let’s see.  snake eyes. sorry, bud."
35510,Sheldon,"oh yes, it’s quite extensive. but if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests."
44451,Sheldon,"uh, uh, i couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line."
39172,Sheldon,i can see how that would be upsetting. come in. i’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
36113,Sheldon,this is money i’m not using.
38868,Sheldon,i’ll be right back.
39931,Sheldon,"oh, dear, mr. d’onofrio’s in the hospital. why do these things always happen to me?"
36904,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i got bored and drifted off. where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?"
42044,Sheldon,"no, i am not. and this esram buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two ram types."
40335,Sheldon,"yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, ms. jenson. fyi, there will be no breaks."
44179,Sheldon,professor hawking.
39009,Sheldon,"come on, you can’t wait two minutes?"
44696,Sheldon,"penny, i am going to tell you a story that i’ve never told anyone."
44563,Sheldon,why? it clearly doesn’t work.
44405,Sheldon,"i can understand that. from the moment people realized i was a genius, i’ve been sheldon the genius. although i’ve never really wanted a break from that, so i suppose i don’t understand. which is ironic ’cause, you know, genius."
34312,Sheldon,"uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of kryptonian skin cells."
38922,Sheldon,"one moment.  i’m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold."
42420,Sheldon,"oh, listen to them. not even married and the honeymoon’s over."
44671,Sheldon,fine.
37719,Sheldon,just making polite dinner conversation. your turn.
34781,Sheldon,"in what words then, exactly"
37873,Sheldon,"well, then you might want to avoid east texas."
42722,Sheldon,if you didn’t press record…
35066,Sheldon,no. i decline to provide one.
36164,Sheldon,"leonard, i had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you."
44953,Sheldon,amy? wake up.
40614,Sheldon,"great. now, this may look like a tic tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath."
38941,Sheldon,"you know, the joke’s on him. without the certificate of authenticity, that bat’leth is worthless."
42925,Sheldon,and send.
37352,Sheldon,albert einstein.
40303,Sheldon,"yeah, just a heads-up: penny knows that you blabbed about leonard. she’s pretty mad."
45118,Sheldon,"well, hey. now she’s angry, too. this thing works like gangbusters."
35778,Sheldon,"woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken."
36540,Sheldon,i agree. it’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. check your messages.
34314,Sheldon,i hardly think so. 
39544,Sheldon,mine was great. i’m going to be a mommy. 
36599,Sheldon,"yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. now where do we stand on the freezer?"
37908,Sheldon,so this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
44919,Sheldon,"oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up."
42605,Sheldon,"my point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism i’ve used many times. i did it the first time i went to see you in a play. you had no idea commander umfrumf of ceti alpha three was in the audience. oh, don’t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up."
34272,Sheldon,"ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause."
37963,Sheldon,"essentially, yes."
43629,Sheldon,but you won’t need much for that.
43588,Sheldon,i’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
38860,Sheldon,so you’re saying this is a regulation deck?
38151,Sheldon,yes?
37156,Sheldon,"and to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?"
43735,Sheldon,"ooh, that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. you know what? you eat it. you’re married, it doesn’t matter what you look like."
42483,Sheldon,"yeah, well, no, not to them. to me. time traveling mailbox. the only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet."
44259,Sheldon,it ends with dinosaurs. i’m sorry if you think less of me.
45796,Sheldon,"this is a photograph of the 1911 solvay conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. using photoshop, i’ve introduced a few anachronisms. see if you can spot all 24. i’ll give you the first one. madame curie should not be wearing a digital watch. and go."
41036,Sheldon,fine. bad.
43453,Sheldon,really? i never imagined it any other way.
42757,Sheldon,"yeah, i do. which is why i got amy this."
42318,Sheldon,or had a single piece of fruit.
42524,Sheldon,i miss the old days when i couldn’t tell.
45772,Sheldon,why can’t i recall this song? this is taking far too long. the urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.
36580,Sheldon,i would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
41432,Sheldon,"if it makes you feel any better, amy and i are fine. i mean, really good."
44829,Sheldon,"yeah, i have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste."
43385,Sheldon,"my aunt and uncle were married 63 years. towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt."
45068,Sheldon,would you like to play a driving game i invented?
39428,Sheldon,"or maybe i’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means i’m still basically a toddler."
44733,Sheldon,"stuart, wait. i do know what it feels like to be left out. "
35489,Sheldon,"i did. i told her, i texted her, i sent out a very emphatic twitter. i even changed my facebook status to sheldon cooper wishes penny would leave him alone. i don’t know what else to do."
41473,Sheldon,zone.
37075,Sheldon,"biologically speaking, howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line."
43820,Sheldon,"i was always afraid this day would come. this might be the first step of my descent into madness, where i gradually test the limits of public nudity."
40836,Sheldon, good buddy leonard.
42081,Sheldon,"all right. i’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. i’ve got nothing to show for it, and i feel like a fool."
37916,Sheldon,"if you know so much, how come i have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?"
34394,Sheldon,"leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?"
35706,Sheldon,it’s morse code.
36421,Sheldon,"to the comic book store. you’re probably thinking, the comic book store? on a thursday? why, i’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. what you have failed to take into account, penny, is that this is anything can happen thursday."
38482,Sheldon,"yeah, milk duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies."
42798,Sheldon,"well, you’re a physicist, not a circus clown."
39677,Sheldon,i don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at sears.
35830,Sheldon,then how can i say it convincingly?
36148,Sheldon,sarcasm?
39966,Sheldon,penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. penny forgot to use the subjunctive.
43854,Sheldon,"well, my friends are telling me i shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new star wars movie."
39962,Sheldon,three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
35498,Sheldon,would you like to be?
45665,Sheldon,bad leonard.
40467,Sheldon,"my friend, wil wheaton."
35216,Sheldon,"question, how am i going to get leonard a present before the party? i don’t drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a thai restaurant and a gas station. i suppose i could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers. "
44841,Sheldon,"oh, i see what’s happening here. you’re playing hard to get."
36348,Sheldon,i believe i’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
34803,Sheldon,you could have offered me a ride home. 
36485,Sheldon,you’re the milk thief! leonard said i was crazy but i knew that carton felt lighter.
45318,Sheldon,"well, don’t get me wrong. neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. but, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the ford, martha, we’re going for a drive."
35118,Sheldon,well of course they’re movies. were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? that’s absurd. 
38160,Sheldon,you’re right. it would never work. amy finds you tedious.
35970,Sheldon,"oh, penny. i know you think you’re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. you haven’t given me a gift, you’ve given me an obligation."
39822,Sheldon,good one. and an electrical charge.
37628,Sheldon,"oh, i’m ready. i don’t know if stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the east texas christian youth holy roller bowling league championship team. seven to twelve year-old division. also, penny’s pretty good."
44059,Sheldon,"amy, why don’t you look excited? well, you get to watch me play with this."
35636,Sheldon,"i don’t need your help, penny."
43767,Sheldon,"hey. good news, everybody. now that i’m no longer with amy, i have an extra ticket to the annual thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. who wants it? well, you realize you won’t be going alone, i’ll be there the whole time. providing fish and pilgrim facts. can you people hear me?"
45629,Sheldon,no. i can’t let you do this. 
40285,Sheldon,are you sleeping?
36399,Sheldon,i’m just talking about bees. they’re on the discovery channel. what are you talking about?
43231,Sheldon,"perhaps you’d prefer this one. the itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts."
44528,Sheldon,yes ma’am.
34539,Sheldon,i’m coming.
43700,Sheldon,when we got the security camera.
36805,Sheldon,"not technically. in hinduism, cattle are thought to be like god."
36459,Sheldon,"so, i win."
34696,Sheldon,"that’s why the call it cloaking, dead man."
39739,Sheldon,and i have flag knowledge that i have to get out of here!
44994,Sheldon,"it was fine. other than the weird-tasting juice amy gave me, i slept the whole way."
44520,Sheldon,why do people cry at weddings?
45253,Sheldon,"not entirely, the fight over who’s going to drive is still…"
42422,Sheldon,may i have one of your fries?
43436,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry about leonard. thought i raised him better than that."
44996,Sheldon,how did we get in the car?
40005,Sheldon,hello.
42457,Sheldon,no. you’re crazy about me.
38675,Sheldon,why not? it seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.
34389,Sheldon,the internet’s been down for half an hour. 
41967,Sheldon, howard?
40534,Sheldon,"well, unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist."
42501,Sheldon,marty and doc never had have had brought?
43502,Sheldon,no.
34921,Sheldon,"i’m sick, thank you very much. "
40239,Sheldon,every time you drink alcohol.
45377,Sheldon,just do your laundry.
36251,Sheldon,yes.
43443,Sheldon,hang on. you knew that she was going to end it with me? did you try and stop her?
45175,Sheldon,"its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time."
44848,Sheldon,"amy, come back. i don’t know how to open the oysters."
40841,Sheldon,"feelings? what am i, a hippie at a love-in? no. the problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that i couldn’t refute."
45664,Sheldon,"right here. all right, team, open up your practice kits. as the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the cheesecake factory, because apparently i’m “ridiculous,” i’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage casio model 1175 calculator watch i received when i won the earth science medal in 3rd grade. treat it with respect. raj, you will be painting sideburns and a van dyke on a six-inch figurine of legolas the elf. now, remember, a van dyke is a goatee without a moustache. wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game, operation. to begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars."
37871,Sheldon,"hello, amy farrah fowler. i’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. additionally, i’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock."
43455,Sheldon,"perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. in one day, you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve."
45635,Sheldon,hi penny.
35437,Sheldon,that’s a temporal anomaly. corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
41911,Sheldon,"what about the roommate agreement? it specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the furnishing committee. which only sits on alternate years. yeah, and by the way, it sits over there."
41461,Sheldon, amy.
38643,Sheldon,"all right, if no one’s going to guess, i was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back."
35813,Sheldon,you brought a girl to the mars rover control room?
41460,Sheldon,well…
34199,Sheldon,"so if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. if it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits."
34689,Sheldon,"your anger’s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics."
43303,Sheldon,whoa.
39485,Sheldon,"okay. you know, i heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood."
40135,Sheldon,"what, why not?"
44094,Sheldon,"allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. uh, uh, yes, i really am a doctor. uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend."
36406,Sheldon,"they’re gone, penny. they can’t hear you."
34202,Sheldon,"leonard, i don’t think i can do this."
43589,Sheldon,"you know, when my honour is insulted, and i need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove."
44549,Sheldon,fine. ooh. can i use text-to-speech software?
43489,Sheldon,is there a problem?
43472,Sheldon,"we made one heck of a team, huh?"
44246,Sheldon,and i’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
44692,Sheldon,"no. no, if we both like it, i’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry."
41290,Sheldon,"yes, i am."
37169,Sheldon,"well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you."
44947,Sheldon,i’m being awful? you’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
39635,Sheldon,you’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
34392,Sheldon,"if you’re compiling a mix cd for a double suicide.  oh, i hope that scratching post is for you."
41258,Sheldon,"i opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing."
37453,Sheldon,"yes, it is."
38733,Sheldon,"no, that can’t be it. and since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we’re best friends. and i got your back, jack."
34211,Sheldon,you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
43134,Sheldon,"you see, penny, the israelites were in the desert…"
44479,Sheldon,"all right, now i’m starting to sense a little tension."
45281,Sheldon,a housewarming gift for raj.
45688,Sheldon,that’s it! prepare for marshmallow death!
39067,Sheldon,i never bluff. ten.
41172,Sheldon,"yeah, i used to be uncomfortable around people, but then i learned a trick. i pretend everyone i meet is a beloved character from star trek."
45403,Sheldon,"oh, thank goodness."
41916,Sheldon,"you’re right. without realizing it, i’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality."
37626,Sheldon,"well, well, well. if it isn’t wil wheaton, the green goblin to my spider-man, the pope paul the fifth to my galileo, the internet explorer to my firefox."
44799,Sheldon,can we just focus on the decision i’m facing?
41683,Sheldon,what a surprise. did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
35114,Sheldon,"oh, wait. did you want to talk about what’s bothering you? "
45049,Sheldon,anything to drink?
35717,Sheldon,now! do it!
41774,Sheldon,please.
40236,Sheldon,i invited him.
34554,Sheldon,"of course i’m listening. blah blah, hopeless penny delusion, blah blah blah."
42531,Sheldon,interesting. you’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
44360,Sheldon,i’ll be back.
45646,Sheldon,it’s a waste of time. i might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.
37545,Sheldon,they expect me to give a speech at the banquet. i can’t give a speech.
44769,Sheldon,are you going to confront penny?
41969,Sheldon,"but i didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe. despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt."
39714,Sheldon,on a cold winter’s night?
39294,Sheldon,i did. how was yours?
44489,Sheldon,she’s still not answering.
41256,Sheldon,"yes. whew, i feel ten pounds lighter."
42572,Sheldon,are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? that wasn’t a joke.
37647,Sheldon,"it’s a blindingly clever play on words. by appropriating his character’s name and adding the s, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of wesley."
40139,Sheldon,i know.
34376,Sheldon,"goodbye, peasants. "
38822,Sheldon,"we had a good run, you and i."
45198,Sheldon,what is there to gossip about? we barely have one.
39081,Sheldon,"uh, do you know how i solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation."
42847,Sheldon,yes.
34929,Sheldon,thanks for bringing me home. 
44181,Sheldon,"oh, you’re singing. well, i’m sorry."
44465,Sheldon,"hey, good news, i just got off the phone with my mother. she is coming to the wedding."
45252,Sheldon,"yeah, well, get this, neither does penny, that’s why she doesn’t want to go. you set ’em up, i knock ’em down, good job."
37791,Sheldon,"sleep well, my friend."
43790,Sheldon,is that regular or honey nut?
44974,Sheldon,not even a cozy sleeper car on the orient express?
35107,Sheldon,so it’s my turn. why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
43688,Sheldon,listen to this. i just received an e-mail from wil wheaton. leonard nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. it’s about mr. spock and his impact on our culture.
36863,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, no."
40662,Sheldon,"yeah, i’m familiar with your work. c-minus was your gift."
39182,Sheldon,"congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. here’s your i.d. card, your key and your lapel pin. which leonard was too cool to wear. fyi, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other sunday for fresh air."
39349,Sheldon,that was a lovely toast. kudos.
35456,Sheldon,what does that stand for?
40259,Sheldon,"at the movies, wolowitz always eats raisinets."
36792,Sheldon,"well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. how hard is that?"
44507,Sheldon,"so, did you defile my mother or not?"
44294,Sheldon,"okay. well, shall we check each other for ticks?"
40681,Sheldon,"well, that’s not acceptable. i mean, i’m her boss. she needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality."
43486,Sheldon,"i don’t know why you’re so surprised. i watch movies, i see what people do."
35828,Sheldon,"if someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should i say?"
45548,Sheldon,"now of course, my 9am is your noon, so let’s avoid the whole good morning, good afternoon minefield, and let’s just say hello. "
40446,Sheldon,"blonde women, huh?"
35283,Sheldon,"i can see that. unless you’re planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy."
42271,Sheldon,"you and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get engaged, too? why don’t we get a little house, start a family? enjoy our sunset years together? do you hear yourself, woman?"
39419,Sheldon,"thank you. yeah, i’ve learned something today. you and i, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we’re the same. "
37516,Sheldon,"the ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. proof? i did."
42226,Sheldon,"oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. i went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. do you see anything on my forehead that i should be concerned about?"
34363,Sheldon,his imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
36423,Sheldon,"just pick out anything? maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows."
35249,Sheldon,i believe the szechuan palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and i intend to confront them. 
37247,Sheldon,time for bed.
34678,Sheldon,i’ll know. 
41864,Sheldon,"oh, of course. um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the miller hook and platform?"
45722,Sheldon,"nope. oh, you have no idea how annoying this is."
43719,Sheldon,"not true. no, look at me. i had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. and am i emotional about that? no. no, i am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite tv character like nothing happened. ‘cause i am just like him, all logical, all the time."
38025,Sheldon,yes. and i’d thank you to do the same.
36945,Sheldon,"pay attention, leonard. that’s why she can’t play on sunday."
42552,Sheldon,please keep this channel clear for emergencies. thank you.
43990,Sheldon,i can’t believe you’re not on my side. i was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
43575,Sheldon,"no throwing, no catching, no running."
37615,Sheldon,but i sense you’re going to and i don’t want to hear about it. excuse me.
37550,Sheldon,am i? let me tell you a story.
35331,Sheldon,"if you’ll excuse me, i’m going to pack. "
40240,Sheldon,your point being?
40524,Sheldon,where are you going?
39131,Sheldon,where’s the mouthwash?
44342,Sheldon,i love lisa simpson.
41523,Sheldon,goody. what’s it say?
39942,Sheldon,thank you for captioning my nightmare.
45099,Sheldon,a machine that reads emotions is intriguing. it could help me be a more considerate friend.
34553,Sheldon,you know why this hamburger surpasses the big boy? this is a single decker hamburger whereas the big boy is a double decker. this has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio. 
44807,Sheldon,exactly.
43565,Sheldon,"how can you say that? amy’s gone, and you two are married now, so it’s only a matter of time before you’re gone, too."
45172,Sheldon,may i borrow your water?
35501,Sheldon,stay close to the wall. avoid the mummies.
35092,Sheldon,i don’t know what you were worried about. i think it really works in the room.
44876,Sheldon,maybe you’re right.
42851,Sheldon,"why, of course it’s what i want. why would i say it’s what i want if it’s not what i want?"
40324,Sheldon,"well, if i didn’t think you could handle it, i wouldn’t be asking."
44661,Sheldon,"good morning. see? i didn’t knock, but it’s fine. i didn’t knock, but it’s fine. i didn’t knock, but it’s fine. so, how is everyone?"
21847,Sheldon,because no one likes babylon 5.
38742,Sheldon,"well, come now, leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!"
39118,Sheldon,dear lord! have you been drinking it?
38921,Sheldon,fine. leonard?
34332,Sheldon,"because it was immaculate, i mean, you open that man’s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms."
38873,Sheldon,"relax, we’re not under attack right now."
45259,Sheldon,not necessarily. i have four months to find some new friends.
39394,Sheldon,nice. kick a man when he’s down.
45145,Sheldon,then what?
40527,Sheldon,"to be honest, i didn’t know you were here."
43413,Sheldon,"your friends? well, i think you mean my friends. and why wasn’t i invited to this?"
37355,Sheldon,of course it is. even talking to you is sufficiently menial that i can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
40692,Sheldon,"oh, no, he’s not uncomfortable at all. no, he’s loving it. yeah, he’s strutting around like he’s five-foot-six."
34447,Sheldon,"i’m taking a sabbatical, because i won’t kow-tow to mediocre minds. "
37535,Sheldon,"oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. i have to pee."
38093,Sheldon,they do some of their best work at night.
39616,Sheldon,and there’s the first zinger. ouch.
44351,Sheldon,i didn’t say fun fact. i’m not a monster.
40496,Sheldon,will that calm my nerves?
43430,Sheldon,"then no, thank you."
36462,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no, don’t wake her. she’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine."
37389,Sheldon,what? that’s absurd. penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
43674,Sheldon,"that’s true. there’s the u.s. air force, u.s. department of defence, u.s. navy, you and i are going to jail."
38627,Sheldon,"amy, it’s penny’s turn. penny?"
35535,Sheldon,"how will raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? when i was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died."
45481,Sheldon,"howard said i could borrow it, bernadette said forever."
41526,Sheldon,and to think i idolized that man. and why? at the end of the day he’s just another hollywood phony.
40651,Sheldon,"w-w-wait. there’s still four more verses. you don’t sing a song and not finish it. hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know’st it, telling. yonder peasant, who is he? where and what his dwelling? brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost…"
43525,Sheldon,that’s not very nice.
45301,Sheldon,"beverly pointed out that i’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with amy, in the same way that leonard and penny are in their relationship."
44794,Sheldon,"i’m not a child, don’t do that."
43532,Sheldon,"age is a state of mind, leonard. in here i’m 90. why are you taking your bins over there?"
37203,Sheldon,"it is great, isn’t it? we have a wonderful evening ahead of us."
35342,Sheldon,"sorry, i didn’t mean to offend you. obviously you’re not that familiar with indian cinema. "
37918,Sheldon,"oh, no, i wouldn’t care for that. amy?"
38962,Sheldon,really? i didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.
41324,Sheldon,thought i heard you out here.
40782,Sheldon,i feel like i’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. why’d you stop?
36128,Sheldon,all right.
39158,Sheldon,"bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on leonard’s faulty digestive system?"
36382,Sheldon,alicia?
41106,Sheldon,"oh, no, there are no kids. no, the, the show’s for me. come on. i’ll race ya, arthur."
35112,Sheldon,"well, it was a number of things. first the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…"
40647,Sheldon,"wait, wait. svaty vaclav is better known as good king wenceslas from the beloved victorian christmas carol."
37259,Sheldon,"leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?"
35838,Sheldon,"howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. he intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence."
36138,Sheldon,are you sure? because your proposal suggests that you don’t.
35313,Sheldon,"secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. one has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when i try to deceive, i myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.  it’s a joke. it relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. i made it up myself. "
36961,Sheldon,"come on, come on, we’re late."
40480,Sheldon,"yes, quite the kerfuffle."
36767,Sheldon,"there are more things in heaven and earth, horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."
34831,Sheldon,"i would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, i’d recommend you have a cat scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain."
34778,Sheldon,a powerful laxative. 
43582,Sheldon,"well, i’m not sure i have a dominant leg. they’re both pretty submissive."
44774,Sheldon,leonard?
37284,Sheldon,"it’s not what i want, it’s what evolution wants. human beings are primates. primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support."
39066,Sheldon,"he does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15."
37483,Sheldon,i am a scientist. i never apologize for the truth.
39007,Sheldon,what are you doing in there? she can’t be in here.
38587,Sheldon,that’s your app idea?
34197,Sheldon,and the home of the brave.
39426,Sheldon,yours.
35808,Sheldon,defcon 5 means no danger. defcon 1 is a crisis.
37755,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, i have something for you. per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that i will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment."
36494,Sheldon,are you and leonard friends with benefits?
37938,Sheldon,"in these uncertain times, doesn’t humanity deserve a gift?"
45740,Sheldon,i still can’t sleep.
38967,Sheldon,"all right, get this. bernadette is thinking about breaking up with howard."
35534,Sheldon,"oh! no, i beg to differ. of the three of us, i was by far the most supportive."
42825,Sheldon, penny?
36781,Sheldon,"if you let me use negative reinforcement, i can get it done before we go to bed."
38044,Sheldon,"my apologies. raj, howard, i’d like you to meet dr. robert oppenheimer."
44324,Sheldon,you realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
35393,Sheldon,playing super mario on a poorly coded nintendo 64 emulator.
43539,Sheldon,"i tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in bible study. leonard’s mother is on a book tour. my mee-maw was taking a nap, and after a while siri started repeating her answers."
34320,Sheldon,"ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch."
35000,Sheldon,huh. it can’t be a coincidence. there must be some causal link i’m missing.
35772,Sheldon,"you can’t do that. not only is it a violation of california state law, it flies directly in the face of cheesecake factory policy."
42633,Sheldon,still think it’s me.
44694,Sheldon,you are truly wise.
44566,Sheldon,"it’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. nighty-night, y’all."
34462,Sheldon,"well, there’s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine. "
45815,Sheldon,the great and powerful woz.
38947,Sheldon,todd zarnecki was mean.
35299,Sheldon,"oh, good lord. why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock? "
35356,Sheldon,i can’t tell you.
36428,Sheldon,get her out of here.
36060,Sheldon,me too! most people don’t see it. what are you reading?
39655,Sheldon,"all right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. any new business?"
38252,Sheldon,"you’ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, i am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so i’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. you couldn’t have spent last night with priya, because you were with another woman."
39035,Sheldon,i’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about aztec human sacrifice.
42381,Sheldon,howard’s allergic to peanuts. how can i use that against him?
40581,Sheldon,just breaking in your new car.
36187,Sheldon,"based on your academic record, any number of things, i would imagine."
38422,Sheldon,"well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, i will propose a new topic of conversation."
40817,Sheldon,"actually, i have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do."
39420,Sheldon,"i hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living."
35144,Sheldon,no we don’t.
39569,Sheldon,why?
38945,Sheldon,"thank you, penny."
37913,Sheldon,that depends. does square-dancing with my sister at a teens for jesus fourth of july hoedown count as a date?
44519,Sheldon,"hey, hey. she’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa."
42713,Sheldon,"wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present."
40042,Sheldon,fascinating. the only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
39712,Sheldon,in your pyjamas?
42368,Sheldon,how would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
45251,Sheldon,this is an interesting way to stay out of it.
40046,Sheldon,to be played with.
44846,Sheldon,who’s trying to seduce you? after a long day i always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.
37519,Sheldon,looking for something?
40963,Sheldon,"wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally."
40690,Sheldon,"ladies, ladies, please. we’re not here to talk about penny, okay? we’re here to talk about me. uh, i mean einstein von brainstorm. oh, darn it! all right, i guess the cat’s out of the bag. let me explain what’s going on. ricardo is really leonard."
44229,Sheldon,"choosing a new laptop is an incredibly personal ritual. you have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. i, haven’t i lost enough today?"
40089,Sheldon,"howard, please, i’m begging you."
45428,Sheldon,"ah-ah-ah, he’s a geologist, and i have more physics jokes."
21839,Sheldon,"but you didn’t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach."
43730,Sheldon,"oh, dr. and mrs. hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning."
38738,Sheldon,why?
37251,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, they re-did the menu."
41516,Sheldon,"i’m not going to bother him, i’m going to talk to him."
39223,Sheldon,"following in the footsteps of kirk, crunch and kangaroo. "
37148,Sheldon,no.
36016,Sheldon,never. i’d rather see monte dead than in your hands.
34543,Sheldon,she got lucky.
43362,Sheldon,it was. i asked her if she thought i should watch the flash.
42315,Sheldon,"where didn’t i go? i went to new york, chicago, atlanta, denver, seattle."
39656,Sheldon,"superb. this morning i made a palindrome with my alpha-bits. nice hat, bob tahecin."
44247,Sheldon,"sorry, you’re on a need-to-know basis."
39323,Sheldon,"i don’t know. if we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and i’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?"
44096,Sheldon,"yeah, you know what’s not normal? blubbering about emotions during a flag show. unless that emotion is excitement over new zealand changing their flag. yeah, good luck, you crazy kiwis, we’re rooting for you."
40857,Sheldon,we’re not home right now.
43457,Sheldon,"glad you asked. as i see it, there’s a simple solution. your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. it seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. and by dally, i mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action."
36660,Sheldon,i don’t have a sad song. i’m not a child.
34423,Sheldon,"yeah, it really takes the pressure off. "
42500,Sheldon,"unlike hot tub time machine, this couldn’t be more simple. when biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which marty and doc brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. therefore, in the new timeline, marty and doc never brought the time machine…"
45469,Sheldon,raj is teaching me to make croissants.
36733,Sheldon,old comic books. i lost this to wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
40016,Sheldon,hah-hah!
45512,Sheldon,not really. apparently grief can make one less regular.
38346,Sheldon,kirk beat the kobayashi maru by reprogramming the simulator. that’s it.
43340,Sheldon,"okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. how dare you."
44310,Sheldon,"all right, my turn. mm. oh, i know. never have i ever kept a secret bank account, because i think my wife can’t handle money. did i win? i feel like i won."
41361,Sheldon,got it.
40101,Sheldon,"great, thank you. oh, that’s terrific."
40008,Sheldon,"oh, don’t thank me. thank wireless technology. i realized, i can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends."
44612,Sheldon,i don’t know. what if living together kills the romance?
36365,Sheldon,"i never met them. that’s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell."
40280,Sheldon,i like the transformers. do you like the transformers?
41508,Sheldon,"is it me, or does she not look so good?"
45592,Sheldon,bye.
40718,Sheldon,"you, you dirty birdie. i-i thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and i realized i’m deeply offended. now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms."
38228,Sheldon,"well, i think i have a nice 2009 anamantle hc. it’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts."
37551,Sheldon,i was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. summa cum laude is latin for with highest honours.
40082,Sheldon,try to put yourself in my place. imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. and then it turns out there’s another human being.
37158,Sheldon,"tears seem appropriate. enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure."
34717,Sheldon,yes. and would you make it diet? 
35458,Sheldon,now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.
44425,Sheldon,"oh, well, i have a few questions for him about the last avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers."
44907,Sheldon,let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
36624,Sheldon,she does have a short attention span.
40348,Sheldon,"yeah, you had a good run, fake wolowitz. we’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the vhs tape, or, or leonard’s gym membership."
39904,Sheldon,"is he? well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. i see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. i’d smack you with a glove, but just last week i packed away my winter things."
34883,Sheldon,"how could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group. "
44473,Sheldon,"excuse me, i take care of him."
38323,Sheldon,howard. the person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.
37952,Sheldon,"the earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality."
43551,Sheldon,"in general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?"
45077,Sheldon,"interesting. the world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable, but you put ’em together and bleugh. "
35046,Sheldon,"i see. well. at this point i should inform you that i intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears."
37941,Sheldon,"well, it’s not that late. you could still go out and look for number 32. good night."
45601,Sheldon,"uh, breakfast yes, lunch no. i did have a cough drop, but that really rides the line between sucking and eating."
43583,Sheldon,right. always right.
39679,Sheldon,"no, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch."
36516,Sheldon,no. start over.
43128,Sheldon,"yeah, so are you."
37640,Sheldon,"you want me to remove him from the team? i’m the captain, i can do that."
42289,Sheldon,it doesn’t matter.
42428,Sheldon,"yeah, not to be confused with the french fry goodness inventory. that’s pure cooper."
39102,Sheldon,"the fun thing about prince joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself."
43851,Sheldon,"but someone might spoil the movie. no one can spoil amy’s birthday for me. surprise, she’s even older. who saw that coming?"
42057,Sheldon,i had the same feeling when i made my dad buy a betamax instead of a vhs.
41441,Sheldon,"well, i’m done with work, so… ugh!"
41219,Sheldon,"i want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it."
38666,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, i thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road."
42172,Sheldon,get it?
36029,Sheldon,"well then, the solution is simple. i shall befriend him. kripke!"
42055,Sheldon,"you know, i’m proud of me, too. i’ve done all my research, i conducted an informal poll, and i’ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty i’ve made the right choice."
40344,Sheldon,"it’s a kindness, leonard. otherwise, you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips."
45414,Sheldon,"all right, we’re about to go live, everyone on their a-game, good energy. hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper."
40405,Sheldon,what are you smiling at?
34468,Sheldon,"oh, penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?  okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?"
36238,Sheldon,i don’t follow.
34593,Sheldon,close! neeeeeoooooowwwww!
35945,Sheldon,hang on. 130 over 80. a little high. we can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
36254,Sheldon,"oh, no."
41777,Sheldon,hello.
37097,Sheldon,there is no abort.
37912,Sheldon,"given your community college education, i encourage you to ask me as many as possible."
37761,Sheldon,"my room, of course."
34628,Sheldon,"and i cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it’s 8:13 and we’re still not playing halo. "
43254,Sheldon,"you didn’t let me finish. and also regarding the bat, it has sonar."
45799,Sheldon,"that’s discrimination against the otherwise located. i’m going to have to go over your head. manager, manager. oh, lord, look who it is."
40403,Sheldon,night of the living garlic bread?
42940,Sheldon,"what do you want, barry?"
41495,Sheldon,"no, leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. like that time you let koothrappali wax your eyebrows. i’ve got to find a way to stop this thing."
40506,Sheldon,i’m a callous egomaniac. she’s gonna leave me.
45544,Sheldon,and when you’re at the gate?
45226,Sheldon,he also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.
34465,Sheldon,"are you sure. there are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. for example, i noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time."
41352,Sheldon,"it’s not hard, one in five. now you know why i’m pouting."
38812,Sheldon,"yes, i was in a taxi, but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license, so i leapt out and ran for it."
38918,Sheldon,"fine, we’ll abide by the geneva convention. but ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? how many kites? how many scooby-doo trapper keepers?"
34268,Sheldon,leonard has a lady over.
38383,Sheldon,"well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. no cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
39564,Sheldon,don’t be silly. i’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
34509,Sheldon,"he asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure. "
38396,Sheldon,no. crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.
40026,Sheldon,"well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness."
41464,Sheldon,"amy, this isn’t easy to say. all relationships are difficult, but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. and frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo."
43056,Sheldon,i can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
38361,Sheldon,because the print they’re showing on friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.
41270,Sheldon,"aquaman? oh, this isn’t a gag gift, stuart."
44932,Sheldon,but i designed it.
38418,Sheldon,"i’m going to propose a hypothesis. last night, raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the united states government to keep it a secret."
38294,Sheldon,"i’m going to answer that with a visual aid. this is my nine-disc complete lord of the rings trilogy blu-ray set.  mr. wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping i wouldn’t notice. would you characterize that as responsible?"
35891,Sheldon,"it’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?"
39360,Sheldon,"no, leonard, this is your last chance. one day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with dr. sheldon cooper? and you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, i was, but i chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from stand by me that no one remembers."
45214,Sheldon,i like being chauffeured around. it makes me feel important.
34351,Sheldon,you don’t think that crosses a line?
45429,Sheldon,"yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. people were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night."
44993,Sheldon,"yeah. it is good to be home. oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? don’t you maniacs own a calendar?"
35989,Sheldon,"to sheldon, live long and prosper. leonard nimoy."
35097,Sheldon,then no. 
43378,Sheldon,seriously? airborne worms?
37625,Sheldon,i know where my feet have been.
42941,Sheldon,"oh, no, me as well. uh, please e-mail it to sheldon at bazinga dot biz. why dot biz? because i just gave you the business. and also bazinga dot com was taken."
39052,Sheldon,thank you. may i share something with you that’s troubling me?
38725,Sheldon,"well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your facebook page."
36545,Sheldon,it won’t work. the diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
44921,Sheldon,it’s one of a kind.
44039,Sheldon,"uh, roses, bengay, and dr. scholls’ foot powder."
36285,Sheldon,"so, i’m thinking, you won the nobel prize what, three years ago? so you must deal with a whole lot of what has smoot done lately? my thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, cooper-smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the nobel prize, you’ll be back on top."
35180,Sheldon,"i always thought i was more like a cuckoo bird. you know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. luckily for you, that’s where the metaphor ended. "
36764,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. ooh, penny, it’s as if the cheesecake factory is run by witches."
45268,Sheldon,"okay, thanks. just throw it out. speaking of occupants, i’m given to understand raj will be moving into my old room."
40083,Sheldon,"yeah, okay, i can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. let me try again. imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps."
41203,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, a police officer’s glancing in our direction. we’ve been made."
41260,Sheldon,your apology is accepted.
42948,Sheldon,i’m mad at amy.
37781,Sheldon,"no, he doesn’t understand. i understand."
43018,Sheldon,"well, i don’t enjoy presents. and the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words george lucas director’s cut."
38016,Sheldon,it’s how they lure you in. i believe it’s called bait and switch.
38310,Sheldon,do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?
45761,Sheldon,greetings from planet earth. just turn left at alpha centauri. you can’t miss it.
36602,Sheldon,"oh, good, i got it right. are you upset?"
34670,Sheldon,"fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling. "
44868,Sheldon,"you’re happy with who you are. you don’t get jealous of other people. instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river."
35358,Sheldon,that i wouldn’t tell you the secret. shhhhh!
40252,Sheldon,that’s a negative. my mother had me tested. over. 
42477,Sheldon,"oh, really? since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?"
42166,Sheldon,"the majority of people have dark hair. even you, at one time."
40543,Sheldon,"oh, thank you."
43328,Sheldon,but i wasn’t. ‘cause i didn’t have any friends.
44618,Sheldon,"interesting. if my official residence were across the hall, i wonder if i’d need to knock every time i came over here."
43922,Sheldon,sexual insecurity.
40948,Sheldon,"mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, i hear glass ceilings shattering all over town."
38660,Sheldon,all right. you’re an actress. i need you to teach me.
34600,Sheldon,you have a back-up hypothesis. 
40013,Sheldon,is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
40421,Sheldon,"and i’m happy for you, too. you are now friends with someone who is officially friends with stephen hawking. enjoy it, boys. you may have peaked."
34693,Sheldon,it’s halo night. 
41672,Sheldon,"you’re right, that was uncalled for. i take it back."
37538,Sheldon,i’ve done it! i’ve won! the ring is mine! it’s mine!  where’s the ring?
44281,Sheldon,hmm? oh. amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
37339,Sheldon,"oh, all right."
38722,Sheldon,"unlikely. but make your case. keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our saturday night together, and i’m not above minimizing your window."
43077,Sheldon,"they would, wouldn’t they? we could give them cool martian names. and we could teach them about martian history. like, who planted those flags? and, uh, where did that copy of mars attacks! come from?"
45493,Sheldon,so i’m running out of time.
38184,Sheldon,"oh, yes. we’re like wild animals in heat. it’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt."
21808,Sheldon,hmm.
41757,Sheldon,why not?
40246,Sheldon,i should hope so. that’s from the first spider-man movie.
45022,Sheldon,"so my mother thought i was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks i’m incapable of running my own life."
39598,Sheldon,"relationship agreement section 4, boo-boos and ouchies. you have to take care of it."
41714,Sheldon,"oh no, no, i’m not going back in there. that baby is so irritating. he has literally been crying his entire life."
41164,Sheldon,i have not ruled it out.
41131,Sheldon,"so, in a way it’s like i’m your son."
42963,Sheldon,but i just got this pen. it’s got my initials on it and everything. look.
37386,Sheldon,"this is incredible! i’m so happy, i’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. i’m just going to run home and start packing."
43225,Sheldon,"well, leonard, don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?"
40450,Sheldon,no. it would appear as if i’ve lost him. stupid brain.
45528,Sheldon,"am i? yesterday i had an air force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend raj right across the hall."
35561,Sheldon,were you distracted by the possibility that koothrappali might have intercourse with penny tonight?
43879,Sheldon,then it’s settled. amy’s birthday present will be my genitals.
37944,Sheldon,and this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
38448,Sheldon,"don’t. it’s terrible. however, in it, we learn that when spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the vulcan mental discipline of kolinar."
43175,Sheldon,what if i told you that i was the voice of yoda? a recording session i must attend.
43368,Sheldon,too slow?
38935,Sheldon,your doom!
43250,Sheldon,"well, penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?"
36068,Sheldon,it’s a terrific book. i’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
40565,Sheldon,you don’t need an iron man helmet. you’re not iron man.
36347,Sheldon,"alright, let me put it this way. your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night’s work."
44224,Sheldon,what?  hello?
42243,Sheldon,"i was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. good night."
41112,Sheldon,potato clock. do potato clock.
39667,Sheldon,"it’s after nine o’clock, at this hour the streets of pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats."
41858,Sheldon,"howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?"
44233,Sheldon,"yeah, well, he does know his stuff."
41739,Sheldon,i’ve been studying how to make people laugh. they say that comedy is tragedy plus time. let’s tickle some ribs.
44119,Sheldon,i guess we’ll call this a draw.
42551,Sheldon,i told you to use the walkie-talkie!
43291,Sheldon,what about this one?
44090,Sheldon,"well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, i felt it only right to include your name in the title."
44272,Sheldon,"oh, i feel closer to you, too. you know, it’s still a couple of hours until my bedtime."
41414,Sheldon,"huh. yeah, i always took it literally. that’s why i have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. hmm."
35329,Sheldon,"not necessarily. this is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., i’m moving out because i’m moving out. "
39852,Sheldon,there was something wrong with that detergent. that was way too bubbly.
36464,Sheldon,"what exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? does he provide her with health insurance?"
34691,Sheldon,"no, i’m going to ask him to choose between sex and halo 3. as far as i know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems. "
39604,Sheldon,and that’s how it’s done.
39629,Sheldon,"oh, half and half instead of whole milk?"
37476,Sheldon,maybe you should put on your juicy pants again.
41083,Sheldon,"doesn’t matter, does it?"
41067,Sheldon,i am not flying back to texas just so my mom can give me a hug.
37241,Sheldon,"yes, exactly, i had a great time. that’s done, i’ve moved on to other things. for example, after i learn finnish, i’m not going to learn finnish again."
40357,Sheldon,"yeah, once again, i know."
34379,Sheldon,don’t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you’d have an excuse to talk to her.
42188,Sheldon,"oh, i appreciate the offer, but arthur is gone and there’s nothing i can do about it. when darth vader struck down obi-wan, did luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?"
38959,Sheldon,thank you. my father taught me archery as a child. it’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of kmart bourbon.
44949,Sheldon,"i have to admit, leaving you to move in with amy has been harder than i thought it would be."
34744,Sheldon,"oh. alright, noted. sorry."
43902,Sheldon,why are you shaking? are you cold?
37852,Sheldon,are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
41434,Sheldon,hello.
43802,Sheldon,"well, i’d befriend spongebob but he’s not real, so i can’t do that, can i?"
41014,Sheldon,my primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. i might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. or a chainsaw.
34471,Sheldon,"oh, that was a dead end. scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be."
39805,Sheldon,"really? huh! okay. in that case, i will have a s’more by myself. and then i’m gonna have s’more. by myself."
37521,Sheldon," it’s not the first time. i have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. if only i’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then i’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly christmas letter."
43401,Sheldon,why did i just hear amy’s name?
39498,Sheldon,"oh, boy. you know ours is a relationship of the mind."
44627,Sheldon,"you know, leonard and i were very happy before you came along."
40251,Sheldon,i am talking to a man in space. if you don’t have the  then he might as well be at the coffee bean over on lake street.
45580,Sheldon,i’ll get them.
44120,Sheldon,not to mention the impact on our social circle. everything’s going to change. howard won’t be able to come over as much.
37302,Sheldon,"and you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. warm milk, penny?"
37240,Sheldon,i don’t say anything. i merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.
43958,Sheldon,even the girls.
43517,Sheldon,"if i see one scorpion, i am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down."
39800,Sheldon,"oh, he’ll be back. wine and a girl in the dark, he’s gonna be bored out of his mind."
38012,Sheldon,sorry we’re late.
43788,Sheldon,just a few.
42436,Sheldon,"i expected to see howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to disneyland just in time for mickey’s soundsational parade."
34828,Sheldon,you could have told her the truth.
34477,Sheldon,thank you.
42936,Sheldon,how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
35753,Sheldon,but you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
43057,Sheldon,i was playing got your nose. that’s how you get children to like you.
44021,Sheldon,"no. as a fight, it was excellent. she used harsh language and slammed the door. although as i say this, that might not have been what you were asking."
34784,Sheldon,have fun presenting my lucky hunch. 
34698,Sheldon,and now you’re out of life. why did you hit pause?
43434,Sheldon,"leonard told me what happened, so i took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage."
44005,Sheldon,"howard and bernadette, you tried to comfort me when i was ill, and i treated you terribly. i’m sorry."
36664,Sheldon,i missed comic-con and the new star trek movie!
43442,Sheldon,"yeah, i know. forever. who would have believed these things would happen to us?"
43337,Sheldon,did i misspeak about the ring?
39577,Sheldon,"i am not trying to get her back. but, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
42715,Sheldon,"welcome back. our guest today is a returning fan favourite. he puts the reading in your rainbow, the geordi in your la forge, and the kunta in your kinte, mr. levar burton."
44936,Sheldon,"if it’s like your 3-d chess game, then you’re out of your length, width and depth. amy, get the neosporin, somebody just got burned."
36661,Sheldon,really? did you just have the nobel prize in waitressing stolen from you?
44007,Sheldon,"all right, that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. and to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative t-shirts."
42632,Sheldon,me.
44371,Sheldon,"you, you and i spend a lot of time together. can there be a little mystery between us?"
41161,Sheldon,"well, i don’t think our relationship is a joke. i think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?’, that’s a joke. it’s a good one, too, because a horse has a long face."
41895,Sheldon,"yeah, she’s right. you’re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches."
39972,Sheldon,"amy, what do you think?"
41153,Sheldon,the dragon’s christopher walken. that’s perfect.
41581,Sheldon,"this chair is squeaky. now, do i fix it or get a new one?"
35721,Sheldon,"it was a lot more than that. you helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. how can i ever repay you?"
42080,Sheldon,"yes, but you wouldn’t understand."
43381,Sheldon,"well, look at that, even when i’m causing problems, i make the world a better place. hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?"
35673,Sheldon,"three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas."
41830,Sheldon,"me, too. but he wasn’t, was he?"
43873,Sheldon,"well, i said a chance, you know. when you tell them it’s your birthday at bennigan’s, they make a fuss. i don’t see why the philharmonic would be any different."
43935,Sheldon,maybe it’s a new planet.
34315,Sheldon,"well, we don’t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength."
36062,Sheldon,"somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. say, maybe sometime you and i can go see monkeys together. would you like that?"
43090,Sheldon,but it wasn’t my fault. i didn’t exclude him. and i didn’t write the article.
40065,Sheldon,i didn’t. that was a lie. i opened my own toy. and it was already broken so i switched them.
45624,Sheldon,"don’t worry, i’ve got this. ladies and gentlemen, honoured daughters. while mr kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. thank you. "
36721,Sheldon,we haven’t established that i’m wrong once.
38665,Sheldon,are you going to help me or not?
41737,Sheldon,all right.
39588,Sheldon,"with the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, i would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend."
35784,Sheldon,apologize.
36309,Sheldon,"i believe the internal revenue service would strongly disagree. but, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business."
36055,Sheldon,family or friend?
37309,Sheldon,"it will take me a few days to get settled. after i do, i will e-mail you detailed pdfs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to bozeman, montana. in the meantime, please forward my mail."
35980,Sheldon,"i have insufficient data to proceed. excuse me, miss?"
37340,Sheldon,size ratio was all wrong. couldn’t visualize it. needed bigger carbon atoms.
35961,Sheldon,there are no do-overs in wii bowling.
38200,Sheldon,you might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
41688,Sheldon,yes. my sister’s uterus came down with a baby.
42837,Sheldon,and his last meal was a food pellet? you’re a monster.
36696,Sheldon,i sense i may have crossed some sort of line.
37829,Sheldon,"i wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. although, i suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by neil armstrong does qualify as a shiny object."
42901,Sheldon,"only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. i have it ready to go, but i wasn’t gonna do it without you."
37718,Sheldon,no.
39098,Sheldon,it’s three-person chess. did you bring a friend?
45092,Sheldon,"we were discussing raj’s recent breakup and apparently, i was insensitive to him."
38608,Sheldon,you all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
45104,Sheldon,"really? uh, little tip: jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha."
43229,Sheldon,"hey, would you like to hear some songs i’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?"
43429,Sheldon,are you going to say it’s all part of god’s plan?
37866,Sheldon,what’s life without whimsy?
41228,Sheldon,ooh. bad move.
40471,Sheldon,"oh, none that i could see. i saw a man who loved flags almost as much as i do. i got goose bumps."
37053,Sheldon,are you currently pregnant?
42583,Sheldon,what’d you get? what’d you get?
39041,Sheldon,"waltz. it’s a social dance from austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. "
41400,Sheldon,"well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. you see that cabin there? i read they were illegally squatting on indian land. yeah. personally, i think what we did to the native americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. oh, look at little laura ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. peanut butter? huh? that’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. if i knew this show was about time travel, i would have watched it much sooner."
40232,Sheldon,"darn. if you weren’t busy, i’d ask you to join us."
39923,Sheldon,"no. the vibration. we are directly underneath the geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!"
37816,Sheldon,"oh, ubuntu, you are my favourite linux-based operating system."
39292,Sheldon,all aboard! woo-woo! it’s official. i’m an h-o trainiac.
45637,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m moving out. "
38925,Sheldon,"sea world is better. it has shamu, who is literally tons of fun. but for the moment, let’s stay focused on todd zarnecki."
44973,Sheldon,"because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…"
41211,Sheldon, penny. 
39527,Sheldon,"yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important."
45729,Sheldon,"and the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. but, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. the end."
39979,Sheldon,movies or video games? or board game? or trading card games? or lego’s? or dress up? or comic books? or dramatic readings of novelizations? yes to all!
45757,Sheldon,"i’m dr. sheldon cooper, and i’d like to tell you why i should be chosen to go to mars. i’m exceedingly smart. i graduated college at 14. while my brother was getting an std i was getting a phd. penicillin can’t take this away. being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. in fact, animals don’t trust me because i smell like nothing. literally nothing. during the seven-month space flight, i can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. hey, leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?"
36026,Sheldon,tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta. due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
39435,Sheldon,"oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  ah. okay, all right. that one was clever. skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. come on out, merry pranksters. take a bow."
35935,Sheldon,"good morning, dr. stephanie. i trust leonard satisfied you sexually last night."
38809,Sheldon,"i don’t think your heart’s in it, but since you asked. apparently, because leonard is dating raj’s sister, we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment."
41613,Sheldon,my father loved football. he always made me watch it before i was allowed to do my homework.
37174,Sheldon,"my pleasure. for a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a bose condensate."
43680,Sheldon,"finally, something breaks our way."
41837,Sheldon,"in the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…"
41453,Sheldon,"i was asking for directions. apparently, there was a communication problem."
41909,Sheldon,you’re absolutely right. nope.
36964,Sheldon,"no, we’re not. we’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter."
38467,Sheldon,"yes. this is dr. sheldon cooper. is this the zack johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour penny? sorry to bother you. hello. i’m looking for a zack johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour penny. coitus. it means intercourse. and i have a feeling i’m speaking to the right zack. this is sheldon cooper. fine. shelly. yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. no, it doesn’t bother me. yes, smelly shelly does bother me. let me tell you why i’m calling. i’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with amy farrah fowler. amy farrah fowler. yes, that is a girl’s name. good grief. it’s like trying to talk to a dolphin."
45622,Sheldon,"ah, la-la-la, hava nagila. they’ll come, they’ll settle and i’ll win the prize…"
37265,Sheldon,"in anticipation of their arrival, i’ve bagged some evidence. one of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. you should be able to pull some good prints off this. and now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect."
35426,Sheldon,"wait a minute, why am i doing all the giving here? if leonard’s really my friend, why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of leslie winkle?"
44860,Sheldon,"you used to make those jokes about me. now everything is bert, bert, bert."
37882,Sheldon,she’s not my girlfriend.
38028,Sheldon,do i detect a hint of condescension?
37334,Sheldon,"well, i needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t i?"
39982,Sheldon,she’s 93. she won’t be disappointed for very long.
38219,Sheldon,i heard a woman laughing.
45170,Sheldon,i apologize that it’s so warm in here.
39947,Sheldon,i tried once. they do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. it’s like sodom and gomorrah with mousse.
37556,Sheldon,"oh, i doubt that. i haven’t figured out a way, and i’m much smarter than all of you."
41519,Sheldon,"so, what prescription are you getting filled?"
42294,Sheldon,i do.
40532,Sheldon,you were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
36392,Sheldon,he’s upstairs at alicia’s.
40594,Sheldon,"looks like that laptop’s seen better days. if you’re interested, i’m selling this. it’s only two years old, 16 gigabytes of ram, intel core i7 processor, and i can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s penis."
35649,Sheldon,sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
38376,Sheldon,i informed you thusly.
36957,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll start with an easy one, um, isaac newton, madame curie and niels bohr."
41890,Sheldon,"i made a new friend who likes trains as much as i do, uh, i kissed amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. good night."
38876,Sheldon,"oh, yes. in fact, i improved upon it."
42702,Sheldon,233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.
44257,Sheldon,"i used to collect them as a child. the spiral of scales open in the fibonacci sequence. a fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head."
35304,Sheldon,that depends.
39271,Sheldon,cholera is water-borne. you’re mocking me.
44605,Sheldon,i can’t do it. i’m not as smart as i think i am. i’m so sorry. this is all my fault.
36876,Sheldon,"you don’t understand. growing up, i idolized wil wheaton? wesley crusher had an eidetic memory just like me."
40343,Sheldon,"if i’ve learned anything from british television shows on pbs, it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind."
37479,Sheldon,"very well, a quick opening statement. like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. i will demonstrate that i was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. i will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. but first, i will raise a sixth amendment issue. i’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. so, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, sixth amendment. my milk stool is complete."
40322,Sheldon,"well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. there’s a good deal more to come. i didn’t really hit my academic stride until i cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors."
45273,Sheldon,"if you’re implying that i’d have some problem with him moving into my room, you’re wrong. raj is in a difficult financial situation, and i’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it."
45277,Sheldon,wrong. we were standing outside my room in the hallway.
38910,Sheldon,"i don’t care! i’m losin’ it, man!"
37635,Sheldon,"no, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to stuart and his dastardly ringer wil wheaton."
35944,Sheldon,do i have to pull out the paperwork again?
38889,Sheldon,"they stole everything, leonard, everything."
45687,Sheldon,i’ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
39206,Sheldon,"no, you weren’t listening. she said, it’s not what it looks like."
40466,Sheldon,what’s wrong?
39802,Sheldon,"social niceties have been suspended, leonard. we’re in a state of a emergency. the world has descended into darkened turmoil. lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day."
35730,Sheldon,just one more bite.
45374,Sheldon,of course not. i’m too busy to be sick.
39069,Sheldon,eight.
45390,Sheldon,"where’s my notebook? my notebook’s gone. oh, no. "
37890,Sheldon,"i’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity."
41236,Sheldon,you were.
39740,Sheldon,"no, i’m a little rattled. but like the flag over fort sumter, i’m still here. and, take two. hello. i’m dr. sheldon cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. over the next 52 weeks, you and i are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
43276,Sheldon,fine. i wonder if they make i told you so cards in braille.
34954,Sheldon,"under the sink, yellow tupperware bowl. "
35864,Sheldon,"hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. where did you do your medical internship?"
42061,Sheldon,but what if i’m wrong?
36811,Sheldon,"raj, did you get the job with professor laughlin?"
35075,Sheldon,then it’s got to be patrick stewart. 
43325,Sheldon,"ooh, good question. everyone loves stories about sheldon cooper, boy genius."
39077,Sheldon,"all right. last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. i then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and i left."
45582,Sheldon,here you go.
42489,Sheldon,"yeah, i have it on blu-ray. we should watch it."
39482,Sheldon,what?
40786,Sheldon,"oh, dear. now i’m not even smarter than you."
43615,Sheldon,i’m doing all right. i tried fencing today.
38213,Sheldon,that’s unacceptable. we’re supposed to be given written notice.
39507,Sheldon,it would seem amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
38415,Sheldon,"yes. if penny’s going to be spending nights here again, you’ll need to set up an escrow account. sign here."
42956,Sheldon,"kripke, you know, of all the people, barry kripke. i’m so… are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?"
38776,Sheldon,it’s actually thai. you’re slipping.
39940,Sheldon,can you pass the parmesan cheese?
35836,Sheldon,"okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up spock."
44719,Sheldon,"oh. well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that i’m great at surprises."
42123,Sheldon,"oh, i hope so. what happened to you last night?"
45016,Sheldon,"you’re right. i have leonard and howard and raj, stuart, penny, leonard’s mom, bernadette, wil wheaton…"
41957,Sheldon,remember the old days when i used to point out that your check engine light was on?
40792,Sheldon,yes. that is the reason. my work is suffering because of all the laid i’m getting.
41996,Sheldon,"yeah, maybe you better, i took a pretty big sip."
39607,Sheldon,was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
44184,Sheldon,"yeah, well, you’re an engineer. end of joke, burn."
38891,Sheldon,"what choice did i have? the mighty sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. plus, the fbi hung up on me."
45697,Sheldon,"no, no, no, i’m just here for your money. i don’t want to shake anyone’s germy hands. explain it to them, siebert."
36275,Sheldon,"all right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, i need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. easement. it’s a legal right"
42701,Sheldon,"so as they say, all good things must come to an end."
38127,Sheldon,"you know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s probably a sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist."
34373,Sheldon,lock and load. 
41698,Sheldon,and turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic slip ‘n slide.
37885,Sheldon,"all right, everyone pay attention. yes, i have a friend named amy farrah fowler. yes, she is female. yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend."
41975,Sheldon,but i still need to use the bathroom.
36134,Sheldon,"forgive me, penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit."
37825,Sheldon,"one of my best, don’t you think?"
44632,Sheldon,"wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it. "
42744,Sheldon,"hmm. it’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. oh, i’ve got it. this is good."
41223,Sheldon,do i miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? no. do i miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? i don’t think so. do i miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using morse code? 
42850,Sheldon,"stop fighting me on the premise. it’s scientifically valid. i’m going to advance propositions, i just want you to challenge me."
45591,Sheldon,that was fun. it was like mario kart.
43645,Sheldon,"uh, but this is violating university code."
45250,Sheldon,are you listening to this? they deceive each other about everything.
35567,Sheldon,"please, no, nothing so pedestrian. i wanted a griffin."
45557,Sheldon,i am. it is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem.
39558,Sheldon,"and i suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
40926,Sheldon,"all right. i don’t want to, but at least that makes sense."
45691,Sheldon,"the stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of texas."
42380,Sheldon,leonard?
34980,Sheldon,hey.
42974,Sheldon,i think i left my pen in there.
36659,Sheldon,that’s for when i’m sick. sad is not sick.
41433,Sheldon,"uh, it also wouldn’t have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. this is fun. your turn."
38647,Sheldon,tell me what?
35811,Sheldon,"all right, will you at least stipulate that star trek iv: the voyage home is inarguably the best?"
35170,Sheldon,"in principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need i remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex."
45448,Sheldon,"actually, our friendship group is at capacity. but if anybody drops out, you’re at the top of the list. unless it’s raj, in which case, we’ll probably get a person of colour."
41921,Sheldon,"at the bottom. i must say, i’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this."
44749,Sheldon,buda and pest united to form budapest. and that’s why budapest is the budabest. now.
43580,Sheldon,we’re not afraid of physical activity.
40875,Sheldon,"okay. amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. dazzle me. go."
39490,Sheldon,you didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications.
36831,Sheldon,alright?
41616,Sheldon,1993. leon lett blew the game in the final seconds and the dolphins emerged victorious. then i finally got to do my calculus.
38785,Sheldon,"but tonight’s thursday. on thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like jackie chan."
44556,Sheldon,"mm. if it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction."
40628,Sheldon,i don’t want to. but it looks like you left me no choice.
42274,Sheldon,no.
38230,Sheldon,priya?
38287,Sheldon,"you say you’re special agent page, fbi."
37546,Sheldon,i am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. i cannot speak to large crowds.
35001,Sheldon,curiouser and curiouser. 
45552,Sheldon,"now, i’ve learned some fun facts about new jersey to help you make small talk. would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? they’re both shocking."
40568,Sheldon,"yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. really makes these things tough to budge."
39519,Sheldon,"it depends on the activity. for a prostate exam, yes. if you’re playing vegas, i’d add sequins."
43971,Sheldon,i asked for chicken noodle. this is chicken and stars. it’s killing me.
35564,Sheldon,"no. anyway, when i was eight, a montgomery-ward delivery van ran over our cat, lucky."
41878,Sheldon,"dare i say loco? oh, and, amy, guess what? the conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us."
41959,Sheldon,"maybe it’s just something minor. ooh, good news, the light just went out."
41233,Sheldon,"oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone."
34725,Sheldon,that’s princess punchali. 
34297,Sheldon,not to mention imaginary.
38801,Sheldon,"excuse me. before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit."
35782,Sheldon,"you know, i do recall seeing some female undergarments. where was that? oh, yes, earlier this evening i happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. do those look familiar?"
39368,Sheldon,an original mint-in-package wesley crusher action figure.
37784,Sheldon,"get it together, man."
37147,Sheldon,"there’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? ma equals mg?"
37627,Sheldon,"i’m the proud owner of wil wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. what does that tell you?"
39646,Sheldon,"you did it, leonard, you stood up to your bully."
35985,Sheldon,"it is, isn’t it? is it okay if i hide them in your room? the smell makes me nauseated."
44971,Sheldon,"no, and also, i don’t want to disappoint you. i, you know, come on, it’s your birthday. i can soldier through this."
43936,Sheldon,"well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, i’ll be happy."
41016,Sheldon,sheldon cooper does not do cozy.
37324,Sheldon,"electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…"
39000,Sheldon,"leonard, are you in the shower?"
35529,Sheldon,"in general, yes."
37155,Sheldon,a good question.
42157,Sheldon,"turn to you for wisdom? clearly, that cookie is mocking you. you’d never hear that kind of sass from a nutter butter."
40925,Sheldon,"yeah, but now, wait. do whatever i want? or whatever i have to want?"
35965,Sheldon,nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
42491,Sheldon,i did not get a clear answer. i’m gonna set this down now.
37418,Sheldon,"no, it’s not. i’ve got five more slides."
45805,Sheldon,no. you have to start over.
35383,Sheldon,"you know what this means, don’t you? break out the red bull, it’s time to rock mario old school."
40803,Sheldon,"well, the equation balances, but it’s certainly not elegant."
34947,Sheldon,"i’ll teach you. “soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” now you. "
39350,Sheldon,"simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. you sicken me."
44162,Sheldon,thank you. this is all so thoughtful. excuse me.
36557,Sheldon,great restraint on my part.
37801,Sheldon,"wonderful. meaningless pleasantries accomplished. elizabeth, leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him."
43150,Sheldon,"so they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?"
43625,Sheldon,perform the experiment immediately.
37424,Sheldon,cholermus. it’s a traditional swiss breakfast dish. i’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of switzerland.
39056,Sheldon,no.
43432,Sheldon,"wow. well, marriage must agree with you. well, you are just glowing."
35688,Sheldon,aren’t i?
21815,Sheldon,"that’s correct. fyi, i would have accepted any answer other than procreating. come, i’ll show you the rest of the apartment."
38936,Sheldon,good point. basket of puppies.
35454,Sheldon,"sheldor, back online."
39883,Sheldon,dibs.
42729,Sheldon,"oh, no, i’m not going to drink it. i just wanted to hear the pop. yeah, i knew it was coming. still scary."
44074,Sheldon,"yeah, i know. it was quite tense. so here’s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?"
39037,Sheldon,i don’t see why that’s surprising. i excel at so many things. you’ve had my sourdough bread.
42848,Sheldon,yes.
37870,Sheldon,haughty derision it is.
42923,Sheldon,"he wrote back. cooper and hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. it should come as no surprise given they work at cal tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. engineers? do you know how insulting that is?"
39623,Sheldon,"leonard, i platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess."
40207,Sheldon,"it does, indeed. leonard, is it awkward being here with penny given that you recently proposed to her?"
43066,Sheldon,"actually, as part of the application, i was required to make a short video answering that very question. you want to see it?"
44787,Sheldon,but that’s my room.
44942,Sheldon,"my room is paid up until the end of the month, so i can do with it whatever i please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night."
37681,Sheldon,bazinga.
36209,Sheldon,"focus is important. was michael debakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? did alexander fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”"
35874,Sheldon,"we’re going to the movies. what movie? what theatre? what time? if you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job."
44169,Sheldon,"hello, everyone. i, i’d like to apologize for my behaviour. i hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. so, please, enjoy yourselves. oh, this is quickly getting out of hand."
37128,Sheldon,"one moment. subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. apparently, ignorance is bliss. all right, let us begin. where’s your notebook?"
41575,Sheldon,put it on. let’s share the experience.
40090,Sheldon,"do you understand how important hawking is to me? when i was six years old, i dressed up as him for halloween."
43776,Sheldon,hello.
43230,Sheldon,"there was a scientist who had a theory and james clerk maxwell was his name-o. j-a-m-e-s, c-l-e-r-k space m-a-x-w-e-l-l, and james clerk maxwell was his name-o. there was a scientist who had a theory and james clerk maxwell was his name-o, a-m-e-s…"
40650,Sheldon,"it was simple. i combined a well-known historical fact about bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, mee-maw and pop-pop, singing christmas carols while i sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of legos."
36934,Sheldon,"thank you. i’d like to make a sandwich, but i’m out of bread."
39847,Sheldon,"what? excuse me, you have dr. sheldon cooper in your lab. you’re gonna make him do the dishes? that’s like asking the incredible hulk to open a pickle jar."
44577,Sheldon,"huh, what?"
36914,Sheldon,it’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
43598,Sheldon,"barry, a word?"
40910,Sheldon,why would i do that?
42488,Sheldon,really?
45713,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, get away from me, you monster!"
44852,Sheldon,"hey, it’s not even called the genius grant, it’s the macarthur fellowship. just like it’s not frankenstein, it’s frankenstein’s monster. which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. and if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way i brought that full circle."
41592,Sheldon,"leonard, i have something to tell you, but i want you to promise not to flip out."
45574,Sheldon,"well, i was hiding from a bee, but it still counts."
45348,Sheldon,"it seems we have a choice to make. abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship."
21850,Sheldon,there’s a draft on my neck over here.
43471,Sheldon,you wore it the night we went ice-skating. remember?
40954,Sheldon,smart. we don’t want any problems.
37444,Sheldon,what is it about the word unique you don’t understand?
42636,Sheldon,"hey, how did it go?"
44244,Sheldon,it might be easier to show you.
42378,Sheldon,"oh, it’s no trouble, it’s actually a pleasure."
40097,Sheldon,walking away.
43047,Sheldon,"yeah. and if he ever goes berserk, i know i can outrun him. coincidentally, that’s also why i chose you as a roommate."
43106,Sheldon, leonard?
43765,Sheldon,"i am a bit of a unicorn. well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing."
44571,Sheldon,and look how irritable it’s making you!
45602,Sheldon,how thoughtful. thank you.
41664,Sheldon,"don’t you dare use science against me. science is my best friend. oh, good, i’m back up to eight."
38320,Sheldon,raj. have you seen howard?
38520,Sheldon,i’m not going to say another word until you people settle down. i’m waiting.
37227,Sheldon,"oh, yes. so, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?"
45588,Sheldon,see? we both think so.
43277,Sheldon,and a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
37431,Sheldon,"i don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here, leonard."
41614,Sheldon,"i would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz."
35172,Sheldon,am i? here. eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister. 
34480,Sheldon,"this is not a sarape. this is a poncho. a sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother. "
36402,Sheldon,"brown rice, not white?"
43707,Sheldon,"yeah. my 1/18 scale wil wheaton action figure. i also have the other kind of will, and in it i will my wil back to wil."
40935,Sheldon,she’s remarkable.
40021,Sheldon,"oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free."
36249,Sheldon,i’m confused. i thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with leslie winkle.
39929,Sheldon,"okay. i like it a little better when you stay, but all right."
39154,Sheldon,must you?
42414,Sheldon,"ignore them, amy. they’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours."
40992,Sheldon,i panicked. he looked taller than usual.
43221,Sheldon,"g-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers."
45439,Sheldon,"aw, man."
44771,Sheldon,"excellent. i’m very hungry. speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?"
37514,Sheldon,"we can’t sell it. we have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies."
40855,Sheldon,"yeah, why would you?"
42828,Sheldon,"well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? although i could ask the same question about coitus with leonard."
35151,Sheldon,"fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings."
45327,Sheldon,"oh, of course. i’ll get that back. like all my underwear, that notebook says property of sheldon cooper."
36825,Sheldon,bazinga! you’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. i’m your boss now. you may want to laugh at that.
44493,Sheldon,i hope you’re right. ‘cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.
34761,Sheldon,"no we don’t. we have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional. "
34702,Sheldon,it says keep this on your person at all times.  it’s right here under batman’s signature.
35003,Sheldon,"something remarkable. since my prospects for the nobel prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, i’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the nobel peace prize. look, i’m going to solve the middle-east crisis by building an exact replica of jerusalem in the middle of the mexican desert. "
43791,Sheldon,you mixed them. no wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. do you have any questions for me?
41287,Sheldon,"oh, very well. i’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. oh!"
36139,Sheldon,"all right. leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? say hi to kurt for us."
35754,Sheldon,fine. mock parliamentary procedure. at least put it on mute.
43995,Sheldon,now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in detroit longer than you needed to.
40519,Sheldon,"it’s a frisbee-sized wormhole, leonard. you can block it with a frisbee. calm down. "
44149,Sheldon,"i do, but why do you care if i celebrate my birthday at all?"
38550,Sheldon,"all right, fine. if we’re not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?"
41314,Sheldon,"who knows? uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. you say you’re taking me to work, but for all i know, i’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. or a cornfield maze. or a back alley dog fight. you tell me."
41166,Sheldon,"more? i mean, look at us. it’s only been three years, here we are in bed together."
35605,Sheldon,"all right. hmm, huh, i’m sorry, i’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling."
39891,Sheldon,"oh, my. president siebert, i don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. if you’re interested, i can send you a link to a youtube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first."
39827,Sheldon,"you don’t like written suggestions. you don’t like when i give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room. if i didn’t know any better, i’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions."
41540,Sheldon,"well, then, i’ll make this quick. um, i want to talk about the paper you sent leonard. now, i know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and i are friends again, i am at your disposal. and, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. or dead."
39226,Sheldon,what about nebraska?
38854,Sheldon,fine. give me a second.
39203,Sheldon,it’s not what it looks like. it’s not what it looks like.
34882,Sheldon,there have been studies.
42726,Sheldon,hmm. you do get me. someone left a comment.
40121,Sheldon,"well, i can’t help it. that’s an involuntary twinkle."
36924,Sheldon,"that’s how my father always began our football conversations. and if you’d like, after the game, i’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself."
37758,Sheldon,"for your information, i’ll be playing host to dr. elizabeth plimpton."
37888,Sheldon,"yes, penny."
38631,Sheldon,although road trip god does have a certain ring to it.
41690,Sheldon,"well, i never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. you want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?"
41146,Sheldon,"yeah, we, now, penny, we don’t consume alcohol during dungeons & dragons. it impairs our judgment."
42972,Sheldon,"i don’t understand why you’re mad at me. you should be mad at amy. like i was this afternoon. hey, look at that, i let it go."
40333,Sheldon,"oh, well, thank you. welcome aboard."
45291,Sheldon,how come he can say it and i can’t?
37849,Sheldon,"oh, god. that i’ve heard on multiple occasions. in what universe is that lightly toasted? this has to be the worst day of my life. good morning, leonard."
38083,Sheldon,our collaboration is a work of the mind. we don’t need desks.
43345,Sheldon,while my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
44529,Sheldon,look at this. elon musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game.
38277,Sheldon,"mango, caterpillar. what are you doing? you said you liked it!"
36245,Sheldon,"he is referring, of course, to third class on indian railways’ magnificent ranakpur express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from maharashtra to the bikaner junction."
41157,Sheldon,"oh, then i’m out."
44411,Sheldon,"no, it did at first, but then i talked it through with frank and alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective."
45310,Sheldon,things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.
40355,Sheldon,i know.
45204,Sheldon, amy?
45109,Sheldon,"oh, that makes sense, ’cause she’s gone and you miss her."
45728,Sheldon,"president siebert, listen to reason. yeah, i understand i don’t use the parking spot, but that’s not the point. i… yes, i’m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn’t answer the door. and i know you were there, because i saw you through the mail slot. yeah, well, that’s some salty language. may i remind you that you’re the president of a major university, not the president of the potty mouth club. there it is again. do you kiss your mother with that mouth? oh, well, i’m sorry for your loss. good night, sir. unbelievable. he says wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a high-profile asset to the university."
34534,Sheldon,"uh-duh, hold on, hold on!"
36521,Sheldon,"well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then i spent the night. oh, you’ll be happy to know that i now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits."
43844,Sheldon,what?
39753,Sheldon,kripke.
41451,Sheldon,did you know that los angeles has a little sri lanka?
36779,Sheldon,"are you saying that i’m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?"
41130,Sheldon,"but they’ll know i’m not you. should i call myself professor proton, jr.?"
37826,Sheldon,"leonard, leonard. what is that? what is that?"
45430,Sheldon,hold on. we don’t know anything about this woman. 
41897,Sheldon,no one is running anywhere. we’re not getting a dining room table.
44153,Sheldon,"well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure it’s not all caps. i don’t need my dessert yelling at me."
43781,Sheldon,bakersfield. i see. where has this list been all my life?
34299,Sheldon,they’re both curry based cuisines.
35585,Sheldon, penny…
35667,Sheldon,"amazing, an intelligent labradoodle."
40277,Sheldon,i can’t tell you.
45101,Sheldon,you could make it a train room.
44637,Sheldon,it’s penny’s bedroom. plenty of men have gone before.
37027,Sheldon,all right.
36893,Sheldon,"you’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet hoth. your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game."
38503,Sheldon,don’t. he’s making our case.
40887,Sheldon,"yes, and as you know, i planned to pretend to enjoy it. i’ve been working on this facial expression all day."
40429,Sheldon,"although, i could play the completely unrelated and better word extract . ethical conundrum avoided. thanks, brain."
34472,Sheldon,"i read an article about japanese scientists, who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and i thought hey, fish nightlights."
38672,Sheldon,all right.
36694,Sheldon,i know. as i’m sure you’re aware…
36697,Sheldon,"is this it? it was inappropriate to discuss leonard and penny’s sex life in front of leonard and penny.  oh, good! now i can eat."
38649,Sheldon,"well, i suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. i think i’ll turn in. i didn’t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway."
35155,Sheldon,that’s okay. lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about. 
39111,Sheldon,i’d like to buy a scone.
43979,Sheldon,"oh, where are we going?"
39612,Sheldon,"so, what’s got you up? did you have a bad clam?"
34864,Sheldon,break a leg. 
37733,Sheldon,do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
45617,Sheldon,what kind of sick?
35295,Sheldon,"oh, even i know that’s lame. "
38111,Sheldon,stand by for my upcoming tat.
44548,Sheldon,am i allowed to inform him that colonel sanders was never actually in the military?
40671,Sheldon,i understand.
42211,Sheldon,i do. after i make them go back and watch one through five first.
37879,Sheldon,i thought you broke up with her. why is she here?
41002,Sheldon,although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
39192,Sheldon,"man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. can you guess what the other is? hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks."
42192,Sheldon,get rid of the trade route part? then how would palpatine get chancellor valorum kicked out of office? how would he get himself elected? how? can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?
40816,Sheldon,"what? i’m annoying? you criticize my behaviour all the time. sheldon, don’t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don’t yawn and point at your watch. sheldon, don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think they’re ugly. you’re impossible."
40862,Sheldon,"she doesn’t want to live with leonard, so he has to come live here again. she’s the snake in our garden. she’s the reason we can’t be happy."
43200,Sheldon,"then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night."
43967,Sheldon,"i hope laughter is the best medicine, ’cause this care package is a joke."
39021,Sheldon,"yes, and when franconi’s went out of business, we switched to graziano’s."
36511,Sheldon,"twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn’t matter. it’s in a galaxy far, far away."
38774,Sheldon,did you get the part?
39765,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you exactly how he did. readiness: unsatisfactory. follows direction: barely. attitude: a little too much. overall: not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno, his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else’s day."
40224,Sheldon,"leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?"
40309,Sheldon,do you remember how upset i was when they replaced edward norton as the hulk?
35872,Sheldon,"you’re kirk, i’m spock, wolowitz is scotty, koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got mccoy."
34369,Sheldon,"hang on penny. how about fans, here and here?"
43507,Sheldon,"uh-oh. according to this mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 vhs tapes."
44891,Sheldon,i can’t take this any more.  bert. 
42939,Sheldon,"uh, barry, uh, how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?"
42623,Sheldon,what’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. and there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what mr. bob eubanks called making whoopee.
43012,Sheldon,"well, what i meant was i often misinterpret how others are feeling. like, i can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. you know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something i’ve done or just in a bad mood. it, it’s incredibly stressful."
38978,Sheldon,"i know. the group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. everyone was set a-twitter. although oddly, no one tweeted."
37114,Sheldon,"it’s not about shoes, is it? i don’t think i could go through that again."
44087,Sheldon,"you know, uh, once i ordered an uber by accident. i just got in and went somewhere."
36815,Sheldon,for me.
43404,Sheldon,"your marriage is causing her pain? yeah, great, i take it back. go ahead and do it. yay for love."
38836,Sheldon,"of course it did. it’s said that archimedes, the ancient greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath."
42573,Sheldon,"hmm. you know, they have delivery people that will do that for you."
35736,Sheldon,…playing klingon boggle.
41198,Sheldon,thank you.
40397,Sheldon,two tea bags in one cup? you’re not at a rave.
43699,Sheldon,when there was no more room in the floor safe.
43265,Sheldon,"oh, don’t be offended. you know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency."
39781,Sheldon,what’s that?
38369,Sheldon,"i rest my case. amy, don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line?"
42017,Sheldon,what did you do?
35418,Sheldon,"do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out."
36247,Sheldon,"of course, if skynet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send terminators back posing as actors who have played terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that’s summer glau from the sarah connor chronicles. no, summer, don’t kill me! i’m pro-robot! ahh!"
39460,Sheldon,is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
39944,Sheldon,"penny, i know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don’t churn our own butter, we don’t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…"
42776,Sheldon,"before you say yes, it’s not the movie about the big dog."
42206,Sheldon,"oh, no. no. i’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 dr. whos."
39110,Sheldon,all right.
36302,Sheldon,and you’re going to let her handle my food?
40301,Sheldon,please don’t hurt my friend.
36118,Sheldon,of course you will. it’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
42238,Sheldon,that’s your problem. you can’t be alone.
36129,Sheldon,"oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. i wasn’t sure."
42649,Sheldon,i suppose that’s true. you’re such a glass half-full kind of guy. i’m going to miss that.
38275,Sheldon,no.
36484,Sheldon,you were in my… why would you… what are you saying?
35852,Sheldon,the statement stands for itself.
44171,Sheldon,"wolowitz, perfect. everyone listen to wolowitz."
34503,Sheldon,"i like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can’t make the assumption that i’ll like the hamburgers here. "
45549,Sheldon,"and just remember, i am proud of you and i support you in all that you do."
39157,Sheldon,it wouldn’help. the human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
36018,Sheldon,indeed. we are prepared for anything he can throw at us.  that’s new.
36714,Sheldon,"if i were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful."
43828,Sheldon,"bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. this song is never going to stop. have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?"
34679,Sheldon,what about the won-tons?
44186,Sheldon,get a load of this guy.
45513,Sheldon,"no, i sat and i sat, but to no avail."
37927,Sheldon,"simple extrapolation. in the three years that i’ve known you, you were single for two. during that time, i saw 17 different suitors. if we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…"
44727,Sheldon,this is it. you are the practice round.
35156,Sheldon,"hmmm? she certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. it’s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence. "
35028,Sheldon,"but i answered, it’s called teamwork. "
39600,Sheldon,"in the year 2000, pope john paul ii was named an honorary harlem globetrotter."
36282,Sheldon,"you’re holding a japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. first, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. you’ll hear a slight click."
37591,Sheldon,"ah, the talking cure. classical freudian, good choice. if it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard rorschach ink blot test are a, a bat, b, a bat, c, a bat, and d, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle."
41261,Sheldon,how about a hearty handshake?
40833,Sheldon,um…
38117,Sheldon,"highly. oh, dear. "
38003,Sheldon,defend.
42263,Sheldon,i see. you’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine.
43205,Sheldon,"hey, look at that. even in your example, you’re all by yourself."
36377,Sheldon,is that your answer or do you not understand the question? we’ll come back to that one.
42721,Sheldon,"and if i may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. but with all its ups and downs, i wouldn’t give it up for the world. except for now, when i’m giving it up. before i sign off, i’d, uh, i’d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. it’s good for times like this. good night."
41489,Sheldon,"amy, i was off by a factor of 10,000. "
38276,Sheldon,you’re so close.
41051,Sheldon, mrs davis? i know you’re in there. i saw your car in the parking lot.
37993,Sheldon,"at my age, do you know how i’m statistically most likely to die?"
39997,Sheldon, penny!
41343,Sheldon,"that’s amusing, i was going to say that about m.i.t., but it works for princeton, too."
35101,Sheldon,"oh, i have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device."
36906,Sheldon,"wolowitz is trying to outflank us. let out some string, add altitude and i’ll go under and cut his line."
39164,Sheldon,"i’d like to respond to that sarcastically. yes, i relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it."
44381,Sheldon,"oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. i’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it."
40829,Sheldon,exactly.
42458,Sheldon,"you know, the more i think about it, the more intrigued i am about having our own store."
42909,Sheldon,"oh, nice to meet you, mr. insightful."
35330,Sheldon,"leonard, i don’t see how i could have made it any simpler. "
41378,Sheldon,"oh, that’s clever."
44649,Sheldon,"no, but i’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack."
42976,Sheldon,hang on.
42890,Sheldon,"well, you could have set newton’s gravitational constant to one. and, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. you know i can’t stand these scented markers."
34763,Sheldon,"i let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. not to put too fine a point on it, but i was throwing you a bone. you’re welcome. "
37503,Sheldon,"well, it’s very simple. in our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, i’m the smart one, wolowitz is the funny one, and koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. that leaves you, by default, as the muscle."
43120,Sheldon,"but you got it, right?"
40505,Sheldon,"amy deserves better. you know, when we buy the planter’s deluxe mix, she eats all the brazil nuts so i don’t have to look at them. she’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel."
36506,Sheldon,may i say one last thing.
44735,Sheldon,"you know, in fact, i’d like to propose a toast. to stuart. a fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest."
42379,Sheldon,"interesting point. you’re suggesting that i have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority."
34523,Sheldon,"i didn’t have to, the dates just happened to coincide. "
37973,Sheldon,"oh, lord, i think it’s about to burst!  on the other hand, it might have been the brussels sprouts."
45290,Sheldon,fine. you took my room. you turned my friends against me. i hope you’re happy.
38077,Sheldon,"thank you, amy. here’s your cat. and here’s your $20."
40492,Sheldon,"first of all, you’re welcome. and furthermore, not being familiar with wil wheaton’s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. get ready for 130 hours of i told you so.  she’s hooked."
37573,Sheldon,really? this time of year? it’s a bit nippy.
39117,Sheldon,what?
42287,Sheldon,my plan is to stop at malls and buy what i need. it’s called living off the land.
42815,Sheldon,okay. go ahead.
38380,Sheldon,we might not get seats?
34310,Sheldon,"in what space, sir, in what space? she’s two feet above the ground. frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her hit the pavement. it would be a more merciful death."
37576,Sheldon,"look, i didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly."
39895,Sheldon,"we’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. and if that doesn’t work, i’m going to poison his tea."
38370,Sheldon,shrewd.
42756,Sheldon,"uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?"
35133,Sheldon,"oh no, morlocks? eat him, eat him. aaaaargh.  leonard!!!!!!!!"
43818,Sheldon,okay.  r-e-s-p-e-c-t. no.
45048,Sheldon,hmm. did you have anything to eat?
41718,Sheldon,"me, too. i got a lot of tv to catch up on."
37623,Sheldon,please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
38180,Sheldon,"amy farrah fowler, that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me."
41276,Sheldon,"oh, penny, i see you’ve ordered pizza. i have chinese food. "
45726,Sheldon,oh! it’s eating my face!
40895,Sheldon,"well, i thought, if i have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would i want to share that with?"
35308,Sheldon,why would you lie about that?
42736,Sheldon,why do you hate me?
44196,Sheldon,so stipulated.
34861,Sheldon,"well, uh, penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by dr emile farminfarmian."
41406,Sheldon,that’s true. he collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
43253,Sheldon,"ah, it’s just like he’s here."
34576,Sheldon,"yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle."
40572,Sheldon,"oh. you said i’m not using my space, so i’m using it."
43867,Sheldon, penny.
35224,Sheldon,"he doesn’t need them, he’s already got a 640 connect switch "
35100,Sheldon,"but if we all go back to the same point in time, bell’s lab is going to get very crowded, he’ll know something’s up. "
45750,Sheldon,gee-ode. gee-ode. i kiss girls now.
38791,Sheldon,wait! leonard! wait! what am i going to do for dinner?
41538,Sheldon,"anyway, i wanted to apologize. i am truly sorry."
34675,Sheldon,"have you seen penny eat chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls. "
36986,Sheldon,were you under the impression that leonard has no complaints about you?
40163,Sheldon,you’re upset. the convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
44861,Sheldon,you want me to read a geology paper?
41390,Sheldon,"of course. you know, why couldn’t she just like ziggy? yeah? that thing’s riddled with plot holes."
43878,Sheldon,"intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but i’d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time."
35802,Sheldon,"oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters."
44593,Sheldon,you guys stink.
38721,Sheldon,"and so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, i stayed right here and did a load of whites."
39778,Sheldon,"oh, your concern for me is touching. it will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow."
42449,Sheldon,"i miss stuart’s place. all this loud music and exposed brick. what, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig’s house?"
45613,Sheldon,this is very awkward.
45793,Sheldon,"very well. i don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like knight rider."
35463,Sheldon,level three and she thinks she’s rich! what a noob.
45176,Sheldon,kind of busy right now.
38923,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i thought this delay was so you could watch wheel of fortune with your mother."
43281,Sheldon,why would they say at least? is it ten toggles? is it a hundred toggles? you know? is it a thousand toggles? ten thousand toggles? a hundred thousand toggles?
35951,Sheldon,wha??
35587,Sheldon,"no, wait. you have to drive me to work."
43952,Sheldon,"it’s perfect. it appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of valentine’s day forever."
45517,Sheldon,"no, to wake up every morning and know you’re there is a great comfort to me. mmm, tasteless. how do you do it?"
34746,Sheldon,"and boring, her words. "
39475,Sheldon,i’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.
36322,Sheldon,want me to show my work?
34342,Sheldon,you might want to speak in a lower register.
36468,Sheldon,"i bet he’s someone from babylon 5, we’re never going to guess."
38582,Sheldon,he wouldn’t drive me to work today. i had to wear my bus pants.
40444,Sheldon,"yeah, i hear you, brother."
41773,Sheldon,"leonard, wait. take me with you."
40050,Sheldon,"what is it now, tiny spock?"
43298,Sheldon,i think metaphorically. but he was in the bathroom for a while.
36727,Sheldon,"no, no. we’re here, let’s settle this. professor, can you identify our cricket?"
35927,Sheldon,"leonard, there’s one more thing. under article one, section three of our roommate agreement, i’m calling an emergency meeting."
21849,Sheldon,and i said yes. and i settle all ties. change seats with me.
42962,Sheldon,okay.
41650,Sheldon,you should probably go.
40290,Sheldon,"yeah, really? i’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when i do it, it’s weird?"
41103,Sheldon,"leonard, you hear that? professor proton said i should call him arthur. that means we’re friends."
42258,Sheldon,i don’t understand. how could we all live together if i’m not there?
36169,Sheldon,i’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
43672,Sheldon,"it’s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter u."
44271,Sheldon,i’m glad i told you about the storage unit.
36310,Sheldon,"penny, i’m a physicist. i have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains."
38623,Sheldon,"copy that, red five. radio contact is sufficient. no need to extend your middle finger."
37601,Sheldon,alcohol? i don’t drink alcohol.
35006,Sheldon,"we’ll make it nice, put out a spread. "
39614,Sheldon,"wear loafers. look at dr. saul perlmutter up there, clutching that nobel prize. what’s the matter, saul? you afraid someone’s going to steal it? like you stole einstein’s cosmological constant?"
35793,Sheldon,thank you.
38646,Sheldon,"oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. i may have changed a few lives today."
37299,Sheldon,"oh! no, she’s right, i don’t need to know what you were doing. carry on. "
41738,Sheldon,"well, don’t ask me. until i see the prequel, i’m lost."
39873,Sheldon,"i was kind of hoping i could continue vacationing in your laboratory. after all, i did book the whole week."
41266,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. heck, you can even push the cart. please don’t take my looking forward to leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence."
35047,Sheldon,you’re welcome. one more thing.
43454,Sheldon,why are you up?
38091,Sheldon,"all right, all right. he can buy his own desk."
37256,Sheldon,good idea. we’ll go to corleone’s.
41936,Sheldon,keep the table. we don’t use that space.
44078,Sheldon,"oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. i always looked up to you and pop-pop. i, i know what a challenging man he could be, but i saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person."
37326,Sheldon,"structure, constant structure. one atom…"
39409,Sheldon,i can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.
37921,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?"
44812,Sheldon,how much will it hurt?
40754,Sheldon,there’s only one logical explanation. somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
43405,Sheldon,hello.
44961,Sheldon,wolowitz might hand out cigars. i had to find my bubble gum cigar so i could join in without looking foolish.
45788,Sheldon,"no, you can’t. wait. come back. halt. authorized personnel only!"
37338,Sheldon,but i don’t want to go to bed.
44703,Sheldon,yes. i need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
44508,Sheldon,did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
40955,Sheldon,"hello, female children. allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. polish-born, french-educated madame curie. co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. with a little hard work, i see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. are we done? can we go?"
34463,Sheldon,well then you’ll want some manganese.
41629,Sheldon,i just vomited on a lot of clowns.
40985,Sheldon,"oh. yeah, well, i was waylaid by penny, bernadette and amy. they made me reveal confidential information about howard’s father."
43604,Sheldon,"true, but penny’s married, and so is bernadette. and your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia."
40171,Sheldon,"a little. but not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them. well, i cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don’t i? i look like the flash about to get married. oh! a tissue! a tissue! oh, good lord!"
45611,Sheldon,i’m not hungry. 
42754,Sheldon,if you like raisins.
43782,Sheldon,"and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at i’d wear shorts if i had a pair. 78."
44422,Sheldon,"all right, back to learning."
36568,Sheldon,"yes. in fact, he was quite enthusiastic. he said, “frankly, if i could send you tonight, i would.”"
40986,Sheldon,i can’t tell you that. i am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
43017,Sheldon,yes.
35531,Sheldon,"here, look, look, i found my missing neutrino."
37043,Sheldon,"mr. spock did not pilot the enterprise. he was the science officer, and i guarantee you that if he ever saw the enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately."
35037,Sheldon,"just look. i’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. the colours are based on star trek, the original series. the three of you will wear support red, and i will wear command gold. "
37480,Sheldon,thank you.
40921,Sheldon," penny. oh yeah, much better."
39608,Sheldon,"oh, oh, oh. was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?"
39830,Sheldon,sarcasm?
37789,Sheldon,"well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. it ended as inexplicably as it began. they had very little in common, except for carnal activity. that’s why i acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. if you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the wet wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. they’re in the drawer labelled wet wipes."
39919,Sheldon,is it? listen.
44834,Sheldon,"would you look at that? the image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it."
42372,Sheldon,you take that back.
44025,Sheldon,"well, that is fine, because i’ve decided that i won’t be joining you. i’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse i feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves."
43596,Sheldon,you really think so?
41549,Sheldon,i’m surprised to see you here.
38956,Sheldon,you’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
38581,Sheldon,leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. and his app team.
44338,Sheldon,"meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting."
39631,Sheldon,"seven little marshmallows, no more no less?"
39008,Sheldon,"according to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection b, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. and believe me, i am experiencing a very majeure force."
34241,Sheldon,what’s the difference?
34245,Sheldon,aaah!
45550,Sheldon,"oh, and one last thing. if you find yourself working with a male scientist who’s as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like thor, well, then i want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately."
40376,Sheldon,"all games are made up. they’re not found in nature. you don’t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of rock’em sock’em robots."
42684,Sheldon,"the reason i was being a pain in the b is because i was worried about him, and no one else was."
41855,Sheldon,"look, i appreciate the effort, but i’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me."
37194,Sheldon,"well, the germans have always been a comforting people. just remember, leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family."
37382,Sheldon,"in pre-1976 terms, neener-neener."
41213,Sheldon,"to be honest, i did."
40215,Sheldon,"i bought you and bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. which places me in your debt and i can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man."
35740,Sheldon,is qochbe’ spelled with a ?
43271,Sheldon,"leonard, who’s really in charge? the person in charge, or those who put him in charge?"
36814,Sheldon,for me. you’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.
40087,Sheldon,oh!
37467,Sheldon, penny.
36586,Sheldon, penny.
38656,Sheldon,i sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. would you mind very much jumping to it?
35104,Sheldon,"again, time machine. "
38300,Sheldon,i don’t want to. not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of howard wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.
38684,Sheldon,it’s the only explanation i can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
44724,Sheldon,she’s learning english from tv.
36614,Sheldon,"that’s very unlikely, mrs. koothrappali. if raj dies, it’ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear."
41577,Sheldon,"how those nipples feeling, chief?"
39183,Sheldon,"also, you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. tonight is thai food. you’ll find the standard order in appendix b or downloadable from my ftp server. if you have any questions, here’s the faq sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, i do a live web chat called apartment talk on tuesday nights."
38639,Sheldon,"all right, why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic."
36180,Sheldon,"you see right through me, don’t you?"
37273,Sheldon,i do not have to urinate. i am the master of my own bladder. drat.
38269,Sheldon,you used my toothbrush?
37771,Sheldon,yes. why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
40255,Sheldon,excuse me. i didn’t authorize this.
40639,Sheldon,"actually that helps, thank you."
35215,Sheldon,oh. fair enough. 
35818,Sheldon,plus i understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
34615,Sheldon,tea. when people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. there there. you want to talk about it?
37658,Sheldon,you weren’t the ball.
36166,Sheldon,her reasoning is unassailable. it is one o’clock.
40007,Sheldon,yes. i decided to find a way that i could have this experience and enjoy it.
40590,Sheldon,"a naked man sat on it. now, here’s my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. what test do you have to detect lipid residue?"
44804,Sheldon,hello.
45090,Sheldon,"well, i thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out i was being offensive."
45656,Sheldon,"there once was a brave lad named leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. he faced a fearsome giant, while raj just wanted to pee."
42225,Sheldon,"well, until they invent nose condoms, i’m not finding out."
37081,Sheldon,what do you want?
44140,Sheldon,will you guys keep it down?
42150,Sheldon,my mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.
35143,Sheldon,"they were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues. "
41087,Sheldon,"leonard, you’ll never guess who i just found online. hey!"
37270,Sheldon,"well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. if so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop."
36483,Sheldon,what’s it doing in my apartment?
38705,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i just love that line. even the way you do it.
36296,Sheldon,"well, the contents are irrelevant. a legal bailment has been created. does that mean nothing to you?"
45455,Sheldon,i’m trying to shoot.
39832,Sheldon,"i’m sneaking into work. now, if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket, you tell him it’s some lobster traps."
37715,Sheldon,i’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.
39744,Sheldon,here’s an interesting fact about flags.
45492,Sheldon,this article says the peak age for making a nobel prize-winning discovery is 40. 
43869,Sheldon,keep it up. i got nowhere else to be.
42778,Sheldon,"oh, that wasn’t clear. try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, missy?"
34448,Sheldon,theoretical physicists do not get canned. but yeah. 
42112,Sheldon,"ah, normally i refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?"
39189,Sheldon,you’re living here provisionally. but i must say it’s looking good.
42349,Sheldon,"wow. pouting and running away actually worked. i must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. so, um, what is the solution?"
37982,Sheldon,all right.
37665,Sheldon,"all right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball."
44133,Sheldon,and stronger. who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
44353,Sheldon,cersei uses her body to manipulate men. penny just takes me to the lego store.
38712,Sheldon,"that depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?"
42130,Sheldon,all right. i officially reinstate anything can happen thursday.
43075,Sheldon,"oh, i know. we could be the first to plant a flag on mars. we could be the first to watch mars attacks! on mars. we could be the first to say good lord, what on mars are you talking about?"
39647,Sheldon,"i don’t need to outrun him, i just need to outrun you."
44712,Sheldon,"all right, fine. let’s say that we were to entertain people. what type of gathering did you have in mind? huh? a meal? lunch? brunch? dinner? afternoon tea? a formal tea? hmm? is it a party? and if so, what kind of party? is it a cocktail party? a tupperware party? ooh, is it a surprise party? oh, i hope it’s not a west coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a west coast party don’t stop."
37602,Sheldon,"i don’t feel different, this alcohol’s defective."
44795,Sheldon,"do you know 2001: a space odyssey? all right, now that’s soothing."
37387,Sheldon,"of course, my good friend. come in. help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?"
39146,Sheldon,disagree.
34500,Sheldon,"alright, i’m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of orcs from lord of the rings, we flank the tennessee volunteers, and the north once again wins the battle of gettysburg."
41021,Sheldon,"yes, hello. i’m fine. um, i understand you may have a bad impression of me, so i bought you a gift."
44782,Sheldon,"despite recent events, i do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive."
39964,Sheldon,leonard no sleep while i play bongos. bongo solo.
39437,Sheldon,"please, fright depends on an element of surprise. the simple fact is, because i am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. "
39197,Sheldon,i have paperwork that says differently.
37416,Sheldon,here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. aka me. and here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. aka you.
40899,Sheldon,"so, penny, i understand you would like to learn more about flags."
42503,Sheldon,"do you know that the word wiener comes from the german name of the austrian capital vienna, or wien?"
40395,Sheldon,"oh, well."
37271,Sheldon,the only thing we can do. watch tv on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
40623,Sheldon,"i got the results back. have you developed any of the following symptoms? a growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire."
42554,Sheldon,you’re not going to have funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the earth.
37740,Sheldon,"yes, but i rephrased it to avoid offending the hos."
38620,Sheldon,"she made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild."
39450,Sheldon,"i tried to scare an indian with a snake. come on, cooper. you’re better than this."
37523,Sheldon,"no, it’s mine."
35861,Sheldon,thank you.
38192,Sheldon,cobbler. i’m still laughing.
38303,Sheldon,"sleep eludes me, leonard."
39115,Sheldon,when it’s done charging. or you land on the time machine. obviously.
44600,Sheldon,"howard, can i ask you a question?"
41505,Sheldon,"congratulations, dr. fowler. you just made the fort."
36047,Sheldon,i don’t see how you could.
39782,Sheldon,"hello, stuart."
42800,Sheldon,"well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now."
35870,Sheldon,"i do. do you? because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since i sat down."
43300,Sheldon,"mm. sorry. ah, maybe it’s for the best. i hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados."
40131,Sheldon,fine. you have very tiny hands.
41436,Sheldon,"yeah, you make a good point. it would appear i was worried for nothing. look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. don’t worry, little moth. the flame will come to you."
38940,Sheldon,"well, he’s even more cunning than we thought."
45328,Sheldon,"i’d write that down, but i can’t now, can i?"
34877,Sheldon,"no. we’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production."
36269,Sheldon,"okay, step four. do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?"
39305,Sheldon,"yes. from here on in, i’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. page 14, item seven."
42717,Sheldon,while you watch me do it.
36936,Sheldon,"so leonard, how goes the mimesis?"
34350,Sheldon,"granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of penny’s quality of life."
44201,Sheldon,"if she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd."
40863,Sheldon,"i said the truth. you don’t want to live with leonard, and you know it."
43875,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no. she’d be going alone. well, if you think i’m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep."
36122,Sheldon,"the learning opportunities would be abundant. additionally, i like having my belly scratched."
34561,Sheldon,no.
34298,Sheldon,"we can’t have thai food, we had indian for lunch."
45749,Sheldon,do you know what’s great? geology. oh. look at this geode. that’s fun to say. gee-ode. gee-ode.
36786,Sheldon,come again?
39453,Sheldon,i thought you were leaving the apartment.
34496,Sheldon,i got my job back.
39340,Sheldon,"i see what you’re doing. you accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. fiendishly clever."
39194,Sheldon,"mmm, all right. it would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. good night. please note, it is now past ten p.m. per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire."
40586,Sheldon,there is nothing to say. except i’m the bigger man. i’m not kidding. say it.
37705,Sheldon,"no, of course not. that would be odd and suspicious behavior."
42415,Sheldon,"i wasn’t making a joke, i was merely stating fact. amy and i have a superior relationship to yours."
40157,Sheldon,talk to the hand.
35298,Sheldon,"oh, hi penny. fyi, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so i’d avoid using that for your delicates. "
38826,Sheldon,"and good-bye to you, sir. he’ll be back."
43689,Sheldon,"well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and wil thought i’d be good for it."
45643,Sheldon,have we at this point met our social obligations?
42826,Sheldon, penny?
44659,Sheldon,what are you doing down there?
42270,Sheldon,i don’t know. perhaps.
41725,Sheldon,"yay, penny."
42857,Sheldon,"well, as you may know, i’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and i thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?"
41486,Sheldon,"no. no, no, no, no."
41587,Sheldon,how is it i can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?
34758,Sheldon,i know. i read it before i threw it out. 
38094,Sheldon,one question.
34819,Sheldon,"so, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath. "
36832,Sheldon,good.
44079,Sheldon,"yeah, well, that is exactly what i’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress."
37167,Sheldon,no. isaac goes at the top of the tree.
34919,Sheldon,"howard, i’m sick. "
38374,Sheldon,hugh people need to listen to me. it’s time to get in line for the movie. and that’s how you tell a knock-knock joke.
36757,Sheldon,i want oatmeal.
44165,Sheldon,i know that you worked hard to put this together. i’m sorry i’m ruining it.
42048,Sheldon,"well, they do."
36160,Sheldon,what a remarkable woman.
44415,Sheldon,yes. kardashian.
39162,Sheldon,your doctorate is in neurobiology. i fail to see the distinction.
38844,Sheldon,i had to leave. they were having fun wrong.
37906,Sheldon,hurry. we’re going to be late.
45523,Sheldon,what is there to talk about? you have to take it. it’s important.
45397,Sheldon,"i, no, that is preposterous. maybe."
34597,Sheldon,what?
39153,Sheldon,mountain elf.
35375,Sheldon,oh no.
43722,Sheldon,better. did wil and adam leave?
41370,Sheldon,yes. yes. my brain is better than everybody’s.
43038,Sheldon,"well, this is me. it’s been a very interesting evening."
37834,Sheldon,"see, now this is a man for penny."
37180,Sheldon,"well, i’m not sure about interesting, but…"
39652,Sheldon,"coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. when i was five, billy sparks put a mexican peso up my nose."
40907,Sheldon,"good news. uh, the latest episode of fun with flags is online."
36847,Sheldon, raj.
41791,Sheldon,"the best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. when i decided i was going to be a physicist, i didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from ms. pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year."
34498,Sheldon,"thanks, mom. mom?"
39486,Sheldon,who thinks amy was eaten by a bobcat?
42388,Sheldon,what are you doing?
43744,Sheldon,"off the top of my head? uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while i watch daredevil."
36313,Sheldon,"just to be clear here, you’re asking for my assistance."
42054,Sheldon,"thanks, grandma."
40552,Sheldon,"what are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?"
44903,Sheldon,"i can’t. thank you, professor hawking. you are a gift to mankind. there should be statues of you everywhere. you know, the lincoln memorial has a big chair. we could swap you right in."
41371,Sheldon,to the planetarium.
44045,Sheldon,"oh, no, she doesn’t even know she has it. no, i had my sister slip it in her bag so that i can track her like a sea turtle."
36231,Sheldon,"george smoot is a nobel prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. his work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe."
39591,Sheldon,"well, that’s enough of that. sorry to interrupt. you two enjoy your date. here’s a dollar for your troubles. get yourself some sour patch kids."
41117,Sheldon,"well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but i didn’t have any friends growing up."
35707,Sheldon,so we can communicate through the wall.
44341,Sheldon,"well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. see, leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. this is what a generation raised on bart simpson looks like."
41987,Sheldon,"but if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you."
39225,Sheldon,"excuse me. it’s major sheldon cooper. with my last breath, i awarded myself a battlefield promotion. it’s kind of a big deal."
35789,Sheldon,mwah-ha-ha.
45488,Sheldon,are you calling me a quitter?
45649,Sheldon,"greetings, hamburger toucher. you are probably wondering why you cannot im with your little friends about how much you heart various things. well, this recorded message is alerting you that i am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our wifi. if you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own wifi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me."
42889,Sheldon,hmm.
35080,Sheldon,you bid $800.
44410,Sheldon,of course.
42392,Sheldon,why?
37762,Sheldon,go ahead.
44679,Sheldon,"well, as a male, i have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my dna. restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature."
38862,Sheldon,"oh, oh, please, if i don’t know, you don’t know. that’s axiomatic."
42599,Sheldon,"true. sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon."
44369,Sheldon,"oh, but i won’t be there."
45433,Sheldon,she’s younger and far more attractive than he is. they’re copying you two.
45293,Sheldon,"well, our friend raj moved into my old room, and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me."
45614,Sheldon,"i’m not staring, i’m mulling."
44339,Sheldon,"yeah, amy, just one second. meeting."
40555,Sheldon,"leonard, you’re my best friend. why don’t you ever take my side?"
41981,Sheldon,yeah.
42149,Sheldon,i don’t understand my food. chinese noodles with korean barbecue in a taco.
40620,Sheldon,"uh, i’m going to draw you a soothing bath. where’s your bath thermometer?"
41565,Sheldon,"leonard, let me look in the box."
36932,Sheldon,what’s funny about cylon toast?
35694,Sheldon,you heard her. how can i argue with me?
43030,Sheldon,what?
40637,Sheldon,a christmas gift? you know i don’t enjoy christmas.
36491,Sheldon,"okay, that’s question 20, you have to guess."
37451,Sheldon,a summons for what?
41991,Sheldon,i’m not nearly drunk enough. okay. do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?
38391,Sheldon,this is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. explain to me why wil wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t.
41556,Sheldon,can i invite you in for tea?
35233,Sheldon,i know everything about this stuff.
39517,Sheldon,"quick, what does a hawk sound like?"
40683,Sheldon,"i want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. uh, in the past, i’ve reached out to each of you individually, but i believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative t-shirts i have dubbed sheldon cooper’s council of ladies."
42090,Sheldon,"i am. yeah, penny pointed out that what i’m going through is essentially a breakup. and according to cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship."
40020,Sheldon,"well played, amy farrah fowler. let me get my coat.  oh, grow up, leonard."
37034,Sheldon,"for the record, i should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle."
42323,Sheldon,"well, i was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that’ll work. please? this’ll be quick. leonard? as soon as we get home, i want to have coitus with amy. okay, she can’t hear. the reason i called you is because i didn’t want amy to know i couldn’t make it on my own."
38047,Sheldon,"yes. this is enrico fermi, richard feynman, edward teller, otto frisch, and zazzles."
40111,Sheldon,what are you all staring at? didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with stephen hawking before?
40009,Sheldon,"oh, i got that covered. headset. i won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying."
34439,Sheldon,as do i.
37957,Sheldon,a dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. no one can hate that.
38173,Sheldon,tell her i’m not here.
45471,Sheldon,"yes, it is delicious. physicist, baker, lover, what can’t i do?"
39140,Sheldon,i can’t.
45747,Sheldon,"hawkman. it’s your old buddy sheldonoscopy. how come you didn’t pick up the phone? oh, right. my bad."
43903,Sheldon,why?
36921,Sheldon,are you making this a tier one friendship request?
37897,Sheldon, penny.
38327,Sheldon,"you’re tricking me. it really is, isn’t it?"
41624,Sheldon,she’s so tiny. it’s funny when she’s mad.
38109,Sheldon,why do you even want this here? its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
39699,Sheldon,"all right, then. the reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother."
43392,Sheldon,"well, gollum, you’re an expert on rings. what do i do with this one?"
42124,Sheldon,"well, you know, i’ve always been a fan of a story told by attar of nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. and that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass."
34875,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, leonard, this is toby loobenfeld, he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at mit."
38059,Sheldon,"i’d like you to meet oppenheimer, frisch, panofsky, feynman, weisskopf…"
44142,Sheldon,"oh, i suppose that’s a discussion we could have."
34502,Sheldon,statistically unlikely. 
38204,Sheldon,"go north. you can’t go that way. go west. a troll blocks your passage. okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. with what? with sword.  you don’t have the sword. good golly, it’s as if it’s actually happening to me."
41003,Sheldon,"uh, penny, i, i have a couple of questions about your closet. is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?"
40312,Sheldon,"yeah, settle down there, fake wolowitz. no one likes a kiss-up."
44457,Sheldon,"excuse me, excuse me, can i please see a show of hands? who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?"
36001,Sheldon,his name is monte.
43149,Sheldon,what reference?
37498,Sheldon,we’re not friends at the moment. depends on how this goes.
42313,Sheldon,"oh, i’m fine. why did you come?"
40969,Sheldon,you health nuts kill me.
38052,Sheldon,it’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
45554,Sheldon,"i miss you, too."
37760,Sheldon,"i didn’t realize i was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. you enjoy canadian bacon. i’ve been to toronto."
35406,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i am not going back to the renaissance fair."
41844,Sheldon,really?
41836,Sheldon,"hey, los angeles. i’m on a ferris wheel with darth vader. and he’s nicer than you think."
34411,Sheldon,now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
40682,Sheldon,"oh, please. look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips."
44790,Sheldon,"of course there’s, there’s always your apartment."
38437,Sheldon,who.
36799,Sheldon,"another reason to consider a life of piracy. even today, i understand that’s an all-male profession."
41550,Sheldon,i’ll get leonard.
34579,Sheldon,"see, people get it. "
34334,Sheldon,nan
34578,Sheldon,yes. it’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. 
37612,Sheldon,"rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. and on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis."
37703,Sheldon,what?
35657,Sheldon,"well, no, no, i’m not going to go so far as to say that i represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a homo novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. but i am convinced that the reason i cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because i’m not meant to."
37397,Sheldon,"he can’t kill me, even if i turn."
42666,Sheldon,tell me the truth.
41209,Sheldon,"this isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken."
40665,Sheldon,"but first, i cast a spell of paralysis on stuart and howard."
43469,Sheldon,"on the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. we’re not friends with benefits."
42680,Sheldon,you know those confounded things make me dizzy.
45508,Sheldon,"it’s okay, everything’s here."
36162,Sheldon,"you’re clearly misremembering. your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and i’m betting she never hit you with a bible because you wouldn’t eat your brussels sprouts."
37143,Sheldon,"really? of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?"
38107,Sheldon,yes.
40664,Sheldon,play through the pain.
39252,Sheldon,"i said, name one. you really need to work on your listening skills."
45640,Sheldon,when the two of you reach a natural stopping point i’d like to have a word.
39382,Sheldon,stop yelling! i’m not happy about this.
41185,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll do it."
38100,Sheldon,"brobdingnagian, brobdingna… how did you even get it in here?"
37019,Sheldon,all right. let it never be said that sheldon lee cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
41740,Sheldon,"this is interesting. apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise. "
42376,Sheldon,"oh, i’m working on my lesson plan for wolowitz. he is going to be so lost. look at this section over here. even i don’t really understand it."
39329,Sheldon,"only 8,000? we’re wasting precious time. buy it."
43055,Sheldon,"well, based on your reaction, it looks like i made the right choice. isn’t that right, giuseppe?"
39513,Sheldon,"it’s called ornithophobia. and someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. which is unfortunate, because i have a fear of nets."
44150,Sheldon,"very well. you may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. but then you owe me big-time."
41492,Sheldon,"what matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. i’m not a genius, i’m a fraud."
45036,Sheldon,what? is there another twist coming? is the baby not theirs at all?
45800,Sheldon,"don’t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running."
35732,Sheldon,"time. alright klingons, pencils down."
44567,Sheldon,"i know, i was there."
35367,Sheldon,oh-ho! really? well here’s another nit for you. the flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
41431,Sheldon,"yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you."
36678,Sheldon,my objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
43289,Sheldon,won’t that void the warranty?
39416,Sheldon,are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
39907,Sheldon,"hey! he did that on purpose,"
38789,Sheldon,because we don’t throw parties.
39170,Sheldon,there’s someone at my door.
38525,Sheldon,"no. the two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, i’d have to give a slight edge to the cat. i’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. i agree to be part of your project. congratulations."
35895,Sheldon,"yes, i’m aware of the math, y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?"
45821,Sheldon, penny.
41150,Sheldon,that is amazing. he made me care about the ogre.
45794,Sheldon,"you mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive. there are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. how many can you name?"
34546,Sheldon,i still don’t care. 
43330,Sheldon,"oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree."
41094,Sheldon,of course i do.
43084,Sheldon,why? the theory he came up with just got mentioned in scientific american. he ought to be thrilled.
40503,Sheldon,"penny, please, i think i’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing."
40675,Sheldon,"wait, uh, uh, hang on. in my defense…"
36553,Sheldon,fascinating.
44882,Sheldon,"excuse me, i need to pay bert a proper congratulations."
44209,Sheldon,"yeah, that, too. and scoot over. part of your shadow’s on my spot."
43592,Sheldon,"not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me."
34659,Sheldon,because i am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating mother’s day. 
43159,Sheldon,"yoda’s swamp was in the middle of nowhere. tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. hoth was in the middle of nowhere. that’s code, leonard. he wants us to drop in."
43240,Sheldon,"how nice. here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags."
35684,Sheldon,ramona pointed out that i’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
43000,Sheldon,"oh, i didn’t think of iron man. you know, maybe after myself and i have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert."
45196,Sheldon,why aren’t you talking to me?
35504,Sheldon,what happened to the rest of your group?
41239,Sheldon,"um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?"
34382,Sheldon,"well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again."
37853,Sheldon,i have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.
37720,Sheldon,"well, my new shoes are not made for running."
41823,Sheldon,"no, wait. i need you to call stan lee, leonard nimoy and bill nye the science guy, ’cause, legally, i’m not allowed to. oh, and, also, carrie fisher, you know, ’cause i hear he can be pretty nuts."
34613,Sheldon,he’s a hobbit! i’ve got your back. 
44633,Sheldon,you’re really okay with that?
38247,Sheldon,"alfred knows that barbara gordon is batgirl. which i’ve now just told to batman. see, i can’t keep a secret."
37011,Sheldon,i have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
38536,Sheldon,"duly noted, steve from wichita."
45604,Sheldon,"well, that would raise a number of problems. we’re colleagues. i’m currently in a relation… excuse me a moment."
44668,Sheldon,"whoa, whoa! now you’re making fun of my bona fides?"
40154,Sheldon,"i’m confused. i thought since our reconciliation, i was your friend in this group."
42003,Sheldon,can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?
40896,Sheldon,"it’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend."
36094,Sheldon,"oh. this entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. raj, you’re back in. he likes monkeys."
35324,Sheldon,i said good day! 
39871,Sheldon,"excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. "
41149,Sheldon,"oh, even better than money. you gained experience points."
42752,Sheldon,correct.
36015,Sheldon,"he’s right, leonard. the paradigm is to the death."
40751,Sheldon,"actually, it’s three against one."
34347,Sheldon,morning.
45468,Sheldon,hey.
37183,Sheldon,september 22nd.
34703,Sheldon,hi.
36478,Sheldon,"penny. i realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me."
34957,Sheldon,"personally, i would never use a transporter. because the original sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new sheldon."
37262,Sheldon,"they took our tv, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our ps2, our ps3, our x-box, our x-box 360, our classic nintendo, our super nintendo, our nintendo 64 and our wii."
41513,Sheldon,look. a new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. wow. i can’t wait until i get a rash. 
39549,Sheldon,"i’m not sure how to respond, leonard. i don’t own amy. can’t own a person. at least not since? 1863. president lincoln freed the? slaves! come on leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know."
40709,Sheldon,"so i’ve been told. but i can’t understand what she has to complain about. i mean, she has a front-row seat as i make scientific history. there’s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that’s for anyone. yeah, and just yesterday i led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia."
45585,Sheldon,"i miss you, too. hey, this is good timing. remember that dr. nowitzki i told you about? she’s right here."
40305,Sheldon,i’m sorry. wolowitz would never play that card.
40249,Sheldon,"2311 north los robles avenue, pasadena, california to international space station. can you read me? over. "
35666,Sheldon,that is the prevailing opinion.
43805,Sheldon,"how can you miss a game you’ve never played before, silly?"
43632,Sheldon,he could’ve softened the blow.
35467,Sheldon,"well, have you been to the temple of mithra?"
44033,Sheldon,"oh, that’s very kind of you. but i’m sure you’ll all have a better time without me. let’s go, stuart."
39572,Sheldon,penny.
43222,Sheldon,do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
37417,Sheldon,"please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. this is the large hadron collider at cern in switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. it is a mecca for physicists the world over. this is bath and body works on colorado boulevard. they sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination."
38209,Sheldon,i know.
39783,Sheldon,"no, no. i was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person."
42615,Sheldon,"oh, everything. getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. pointing out that kings aren’t elected. it’s gonna be off the hook."
41148,Sheldon,i ready my quarter-staff.
41705,Sheldon,"a tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about."
37121,Sheldon,"okay, point. what sort of foundation do you have? did you take any science classes in school?"
43649,Sheldon,"oh, of course. an nondescript, white panel van. you may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van."
38703,Sheldon,why?
37749,Sheldon,hold.
36455,Sheldon,"yeah, herbal tea for me, please."
36009,Sheldon,"impressive as that may be, monte is not us. monte has no fear."
36926,Sheldon,"nothing. that, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress."
41259,Sheldon,it is to me; that’s the point.
34191,Sheldon,thank you very much.
43357,Sheldon,been there.
39410,Sheldon,"we appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, mother."
42704,Sheldon,it was so good.
38793,Sheldon,"but what if he does? i’ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach. and frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. i don’t know why he’s serving both."
44243,Sheldon,"i’m not being weird. i, it’s hard to explain."
34898,Sheldon,"i need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. here, swab my throat."
45406,Sheldon,the top secret military information i’m about to tell you.
40606,Sheldon,"you’re sick? you poor kid. well, see ya."
42616,Sheldon,why would you say that?
45420,Sheldon,"oh, and do you remember what you said?"
40192,Sheldon,"look at us, leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies."
37414,Sheldon,"alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, i believe you know why i’m here."
39320,Sheldon,"can’t figure out what to do? i remember those days. now, if you’ll excuse me, i have to…  stay right here."
35609,Sheldon,"good, perfect timing."
37757,Sheldon,sarcasm?
35786,Sheldon,i’ve done no stupid things.
39342,Sheldon,possibly.
35568,Sheldon,"yes, half eagle, half lion."
39789,Sheldon,"yes. and now, i can’t make any promises, but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot."
45027,Sheldon,yeah. here. i’ll catch you up.
42241,Sheldon,sure.
35544,Sheldon,"damn, this is hard.  "
38543,Sheldon,"good one, boss."
34821,Sheldon, leonard…
38298,Sheldon,did i say mars rover?
40098,Sheldon,"hey, fellas, i’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some."
37178,Sheldon,it’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. we discussed it at length during our last video chat. although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
37136,Sheldon,can’t you hold it?
45764,Sheldon,hello.
43395,Sheldon,"some important new information has come to light. women are the worst. i thought it was paper cuts, but i was wrong. no piece of paper ever cut me this deep."
38827,Sheldon,"well, it would appear levar burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started. um, i thought we’d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here. okay. i’m sheldon. uh, for regular readers of the new england journal of high energy physics, i need no introduction. if you’re not familiar with that publication, there’s a free copy in your goody bag. stuart?"
44017,Sheldon,"well, i would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting botox into old lady faces…"
40983,Sheldon,"well played. sometimes i don’t give you enough credit, penny."
39587,Sheldon,i believe i would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
38399,Sheldon,"da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
45526,Sheldon,what does it look like? i’m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.
43938,Sheldon,that’s it? how common. that’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.
44568,Sheldon,how late?
45645,Sheldon,forget it.
44872,Sheldon,"ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…"
35628,Sheldon,i was otherwise engaged.
37817,Sheldon,hello. why do i smell methacrylate?
40997,Sheldon,or that’s complete poppycock which amy made up. it still could be the map.
35827,Sheldon,"leonard, a moment."
41267,Sheldon,that criticism will come later in your report card.
38605,Sheldon,"boy, i’m getting good at this."
43768,Sheldon,"well, howard, what about you?"
39443,Sheldon,"leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail."
35832,Sheldon,this would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.
35013,Sheldon,"screw him, he was weak. "
39687,Sheldon,"good, good, if you had said something clever, she might’ve gotten suspicious."
43193,Sheldon,"amy, the daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. oh, no, i left my sonic screwdriver behind."
37696,Sheldon,"excuse me, i’m thirsty, so i’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage."
42933,Sheldon,then why are you attacking us?
39463,Sheldon,really? that’s very unsettling.
40959,Sheldon,"oh, you shouldn’t have."
40879,Sheldon,mmm.
40578,Sheldon,"he’s trying to kill me, leonard. video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence."
44570,Sheldon,what? you have some coffee.
41578,Sheldon,"gentlemen, please. leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. he can’t walk in my actual shoes. he has the feet of a toddler."
35328,Sheldon,there doesn’t have to be a reason. 
41831,Sheldon,so messed up.
44691,Sheldon,"being with amy has awoken the sexual creature within. when i see a pretty gal walking down the street, i think, hubba hubba, like any other guy."
39127,Sheldon,fire demon.
37041,Sheldon,"that can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. we need to find a service station."
37372,Sheldon,"is it? just a moment ago i had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. bernadette, table 10 wants their check."
36619,Sheldon,"comforting is a part of leadership. it’s not a part i care for, but such is my burden."
45173,Sheldon,gps says we’ll be at the railway in three hours.
37315,Sheldon,"thank you, fellow bozite. and may i say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s chamber of commerce.  one ticket to pasadena, california, please."
43510,Sheldon,you can never be too careful. i got one last year before i went to epcot.
38518,Sheldon,stop counting!
35515,Sheldon,"no, of course not. no, i used trickery and deceit."
42663,Sheldon,"although now that i think about it, leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt."
43370,Sheldon,hello.
42730,Sheldon, levar burton?
45655,Sheldon,"hello, kripke. yes, sheldon cooper here. it occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because i hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… i see. well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage. popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… i see. no, no, no, wait. don’t hang up yet. what about a recreational activity? i bet we share some common interests. tell me an interest of yours. really? on actual horses? tell me another interest of yours. oh no, i’m sorry, i have no desire to get in the water until i absolutely have to. tell me another interest of yours."
42654,Sheldon,fine. what about epilepsy?
42541,Sheldon,"true. sheldon’s mine simulation log, entry one. koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves."
43964,Sheldon,no. but i knew that his yay was sarcastic. not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
43558,Sheldon,"oh, i wish i could, but i realized i’ve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, i’m restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before i met leonard."
40424,Sheldon,"yes. i play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. that ought to let the air out of your tyres, hawking."
45202,Sheldon,this isn’t fair. you’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with penny.
40055,Sheldon,"you know what you are? well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here."
44815,Sheldon,"no, this is for science. i can be brave for science."
34205,Sheldon,i wouldn’t.
42906,Sheldon,i don’t want to talk about it.
43946,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, great news. we discovered a medium-sized asteroid together."
44740,Sheldon,you never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
34289,Sheldon,my mom bought me those pants.
44084,Sheldon,gentlemen.
35526,Sheldon,i’m confused. was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
40418,Sheldon,"earlier today, i invited professor stephen hawking to join me in the popular online game words with friends. moments ago, he accepted my request. do you understand what that means?"
42700,Sheldon,"but the truth is i can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular internet show, and a girlfriend."
39973,Sheldon,"fine, let’s go. thank you for letting me sleep on your couch."
34602,Sheldon,"yes, but you’re much closer to it than he is. "
43797,Sheldon,"it’s called food, friend, fight. one of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle."
45458,Sheldon,"no, but it’s not just video games. i downloaded the new o.s. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone."
34469,Sheldon,i think it’s her time of the month. i marked the calendar for future reference. 
43963,Sheldon,"well, why isn’t everyone happy? your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again."
37577,Sheldon,"hang on. it’s a cardigan. i have to button it. oh, no."
42186,Sheldon,"uh, no, thank you."
37222,Sheldon,i would like a root beer float.
43065,Sheldon,"i was going to make you red zinger, but since mars is the red planet, i went with peppermint."
35614,Sheldon,we had a difference of opinion.
41139,Sheldon,"go on, give him your lunch money."
34801,Sheldon,so it was working.
34375,Sheldon,"there is no more sheldon, i am the swordmaster!"
41851,Sheldon,"i hate every word in that sentence. including in, at, we and a."
37949,Sheldon,"not true. the fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. who’s to say that i don’t share that flawed dna?"
43846,Sheldon,"all right, this goes against everything i stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. lord, this is sheldon cooper. you’re good friends with my mom. i know i’ve spent my life denying that you exist."
45570,Sheldon,"yes. i think you’d like her. she’s extremely intelligent, just like you. unlike you, she’s tall, blonde and used to be an olympic swimmer."
41710,Sheldon,i don’t know. i just got back. 
40345,Sheldon,i believe alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the nobel prize. behold.
42964,Sheldon,i may have a better way that you can teach me.
40687,Sheldon,no. no. no. this is tondelaya della ventimiglia.
34902,Sheldon,wait.  put this in the bathroom.
40238,Sheldon,"oh, i hope that’s a rhetorical question, because i have no clue."
43312,Sheldon,"don’t worry, everyone in here is safe."
38796,Sheldon,raj’s television. i just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
39095,Sheldon,"red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely."
36019,Sheldon,"don’t hurt us, don’t hurt us,"
42113,Sheldon,no more than penny.
41056,Sheldon,"yeah, right on, sister."
43182,Sheldon,"excuse me. leonard, they have a sculpture gallery."
36140,Sheldon,they did.
41843,Sheldon,"oh, right. well, my friends and i couldn’t get into comic-con this year, and i was trying to start my own convention, and i was going to ask if you would be a panelist."
36306,Sheldon,and how much profit do you make per penny blossom?
39253,Sheldon, penny.
36575,Sheldon,"odd, president seibert posed the exact same question."
38069,Sheldon,"well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. i can’t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they’re there."
34993,Sheldon,"well, up until now i’ve had better things to do. so, what are we making today? "
35310,Sheldon,"yeah, but you were neither. "
37632,Sheldon,this is for you.
40517,Sheldon,"i don’t know what she’s talking about, but i’m obligated to agree with her. she’s my girlfriend."
45539,Sheldon,"of course. here, here, let me. i’ve been doing a little research on new jersey, and i was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod."
21854,Sheldon,why not?
34608,Sheldon,"because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be the flash. "
40342,Sheldon,"uh, alex, a moment. i need a word with dr. hofstadter. do you think it’s appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?"
35856,Sheldon,"fine, whatever works."
36355,Sheldon,"very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you’re going to have to answer to my mother."
45243,Sheldon,very well. prepare for a long night of deceit.
44657,Sheldon,"okay, well, i am sorry. i’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. and no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, i’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it."
39136,Sheldon,jibber-jabber? i don’t jibber-jabber.
35890,Sheldon,because?
34533,Sheldon,cool?
37774,Sheldon,"i’m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs."
35220,Sheldon,"okay, i see, so not a dvd burner."
37644,Sheldon,"all right! fence mended, problem swept under the rug. time to bowl! yes, i was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here."
43462,Sheldon,a precocious little internet show known as fun with flags.
43160,Sheldon,"yes. oh, i’m so excited. and i just can’t hide it."
36563,Sheldon,why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
36044,Sheldon,"there are a number of acceptable answers, for example, c: near earth transport, but certainly not b: avocado rancher. and your essay, suggesting that i’d have better luck making friends if i wait ’til the cylons take over? please."
45178,Sheldon,"you know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage."
37707,Sheldon,i’m going the other way. bye.
36024,Sheldon,"first off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. it is extracted from the plant…"
37701,Sheldon,"hold on. nope, no reason."
35632,Sheldon,"excuse me, but i have some concerns about these questions."
41491,Sheldon,sheldon cooper does not get lucky.
36504,Sheldon,"i can’t sleep on your couch. i sleep in a bed. and given it’s dimensions i have no intention of living out e.m. snickering’s beloved children’s book , the tall man from cornwall."
35208,Sheldon,the whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one’s co-conspirators. 
43140,Sheldon,i don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and purell.
35963,Sheldon,it’s a rhetorical question. there is nothing more important than wii bowling night.
38008,Sheldon,"leonard, be serious. we’re playing a game here."
37258,Sheldon,it was listed under seafood.
38131,Sheldon,"it is if you like bridge. do you like bridge, leonard?"
36186,Sheldon,unacceptable. it baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.
35532,Sheldon,"apologise, for what?"
38867,Sheldon,drat. is this your card?
40840,Sheldon,"leonard, please. you know amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn’t ready for."
42125,Sheldon,clogzilla. that’s pretty funny. i don’t think that’s gonna pass.
45737,Sheldon,do you have cufflinks?
38112,Sheldon,yes?
39523,Sheldon,"really? a blazer? all right.  yes, hello. this is dr. sheldon cooper. yeah, i’m at 2311 north robles avenue. yeah, i’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. a blue jay. i’m sorry, this is animal control. i don’t understand the laughter. no, the bird is not in my home. if he was in my home, i obviously would have called 911. sir, i have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. being stuck in a dead-end public service job? or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? or spiders? don’t you think i tried making cat noises?"
34977,Sheldon,"yes, but i assumed i would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg. "
37346,Sheldon,i have good news.
36772,Sheldon,you’re here a lot now.
38883,Sheldon,"apparently, you can’t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the department of homeland security tattling to your mother."
44379,Sheldon,"oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes."
42220,Sheldon,"i thought that subject had run its course, so i changed it. it’s called reading the room, amy."
35002,Sheldon,"no, no, please, come in. yeah, i think you’ll appreciate this, very exciting."
43664,Sheldon,"did you hear that, leonard? there’s plenty we could do about it. do you have a card?"
37862,Sheldon,"well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why i’m having this conversation with you."
34583,Sheldon,"well, i actually might be able to help."
38431,Sheldon,i’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
37004,Sheldon,"i need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.  penny.."
41140,Sheldon,"he does sound effects, too!"
45734,Sheldon,i can’t sleep.
38568,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. i typed that into the label maker, but i just couldn’t press enter. now down to business. what would it take for you to abandon leonard and join me in a rival company? unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard."
36911,Sheldon,"well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you."
35634,Sheldon,no.
39207,Sheldon,oh. well don’t i look silly sitting here wearing this?
38787,Sheldon,"well, i don’t want to go to a party."
42891,Sheldon,it’s good.
34203,Sheldon,"no. we are committing genetic fraud. there’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high iq offspring, think about that. i have a sister with the same basic dna mix who hostesses at fuddruckers."
37548,Sheldon,i’m not accepting the award.
35552,Sheldon,did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
35764,Sheldon,"and then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings."
42830,Sheldon,i’m not going. would you like to know why?
45669,Sheldon,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…"
35336,Sheldon,this is a very old building. 
40129,Sheldon,"oh, for heaven’s sake. i did your laundry, i pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, i, i even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom."
45718,Sheldon,i’m not sure how to do this.
43157,Sheldon,"seems a little confrontational, but all right. you know, we won’t be very far from skywalker ranch."
44539,Sheldon,i don’t see how a tax lawyer from fort lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.
41354,Sheldon,"yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. and stop wasting time."
38110,Sheldon,"all right, i see what’s going on. this is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. well titted."
38057,Sheldon,come in. 
43885,Sheldon,"this is an important night for us, and i’m worried i might be overwhelmed and ruin everything."
45355,Sheldon,hello.
43970,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m dying."
40812,Sheldon,good.
45368,Sheldon,the two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and t equals zero. and i know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.
37984,Sheldon,we’ll never know.
37308,Sheldon,"all right. boone, north carolina. every summer since 1952, boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, dan’l boone. sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. penny, you’re from nebraska, correct?"
40916,Sheldon,okay.
41386,Sheldon,"yeah, except for the fact that indiana jones is completely irrelevant to the story. with or without him, the nazis find the ark, open it and die."
36042,Sheldon,you answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. a b b a c. a b b a c.
42239,Sheldon,how many women have you had dates with?
43461,Sheldon,"i understand we’re no longer a couple, but i would like to remind you that we made a baby together."
35256,Sheldon,"actually, i thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. previously i felt sympathy for the leonard character, now i just find him to be whiny and annoying. "
38886,Sheldon,"hang on. this time do it with me, so i can make sure there’s no monkey business."
34960,Sheldon,"not bad, i myself started graduate school at fourteen."
45130,Sheldon,"i feel the same way about you. now, put your glasses back on. you look weird."
37484,Sheldon,that’s my spot.
35402,Sheldon,"leslie winkle. of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be leslie winkle?"
41548,Sheldon,arthur?
34660,Sheldon,"okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, i now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste."
43627,Sheldon,thank you. aren’t you sweet.
34765,Sheldon,"they’re not supposed to, but they should. "
36617,Sheldon,what?
42330,Sheldon,that i couldn’t do it?
37876,Sheldon,"today, it’s a chinese food retrieval robot. tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill sarah connor."
38928,Sheldon,we are winged fury! which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.
37588,Sheldon,would it be helpful to you if i told you about my dreams?
35494,Sheldon,she comes into my room. no-one’s supposed to be in my room.
41060,Sheldon,i’m deleting it.
45039,Sheldon,oh. a small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off.
37953,Sheldon,by this much.
41562,Sheldon,"oh, thank you. here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles."
39289,Sheldon,"ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding."
37910,Sheldon,i wish you weren’t wearing flip-flops. it’s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
45264,Sheldon,"i know our apartment’s small, but i think we can make room."
36765,Sheldon,"well, thank you. how thoughtful. would you like a chocolate"
35938,Sheldon,"in leonard’s defence, it wasn’t for lack of trying."
37937,Sheldon,using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
42908,Sheldon,then we’re probably okay.
36469,Sheldon,i don’t understand. if you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?
42770,Sheldon,"yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of middle earth, now including the haradwaith territories."
36221,Sheldon,leonard?
42176,Sheldon,professor proton is dead?
35410,Sheldon,"if you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may i suggest one potato two potato, or as i call it the leslie winkle experimental methodology."
42032,Sheldon,"because i’m trying to decide between getting an xbox one or a ps4. oh, pee, why’d i say that?"
43074,Sheldon,"i am. yeah, if i’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, i want you there with me. why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?"
41699,Sheldon,"oh, boy. i picked the wrong day to wear my good robot t-shirt."
21853,Sheldon,wait. let me get my jacket.
36076,Sheldon,i am? i was wrong. it is a fear of heights.
42877,Sheldon,"oh, really? what if i don’t? and before you answer that, can i have my dessert?"
45435,Sheldon,see? it was fine. i didn’t need a time-out.
37049,Sheldon,all right. and how did the accident occur?
39651,Sheldon,"if we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that ryan reynolds was a better choice for green lantern than lovable rogue nathan fillion."
38993,Sheldon,"i must say, amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction."
45030,Sheldon,"well, there’s really not much left to tell. i decided that my mother views me as a child because i never went through a rebellious phase, so, i got an earring.  and here we are."
37738,Sheldon,"i told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. i like spaghetti with little hot dogs."
40734,Sheldon,"yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does."
41750,Sheldon,but i used science to construct the perfect joke.
45693,Sheldon,"nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow."
44585,Sheldon,my head hurts and i’m more tired than ever.
37305,Sheldon,my new computer came with windows 7. windows 7 is much more user-friendly than windows vista. i don’t like that.
37301,Sheldon,would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
42742,Sheldon,"why should i? she knows that i don’t like christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. not only am i going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. like we were the stars of a tijuana sex show."
34249,Sheldon,that is an antisocial implication.
39750,Sheldon,"well done, dr. koothrappali."
39726,Sheldon,"people, people, please, before you say something you both regret, i’d like to place my order."
35775,Sheldon,it’s saturday night. saturday is laundry night.
39627,Sheldon,"you’re being too kind, leonard. you ruined him."
45780,Sheldon,the light’s green.
34493,Sheldon,wouldn’t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
42072,Sheldon,"maybe it’s because i’m not an elitist. what i’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? you know? who’s looking out for joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?"
39399,Sheldon,"yes, penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures."
37311,Sheldon,i am moving on. i’m going to be a bozite.
39673,Sheldon,nuts to that. what else you got?
40244,Sheldon,yes. you’re my ride.
40927,Sheldon,"you know, i haven’t seen raj in several days. is he no longer a part of our social group? and if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? perhaps, this time, we go latin."
45568,Sheldon,"oh, dr. nowitzki is a woman. "
44332,Sheldon,"you keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard."
41337,Sheldon,"which reminds me. this came in the mail, and i want you to have it."
40325,Sheldon,"you, really? you can assess the quality of my work? okay, um, here. i wrote this when i was five years old."
41723,Sheldon,"looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything i was saying? basically just another day at the office."
37522,Sheldon,you mean this ring? next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.
36048,Sheldon,what do you mean!?
43505,Sheldon,"uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside."
35500,Sheldon,"there, problem solved."
43035,Sheldon,"and i, you. and yes, that’s how you say that. yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, i’d say we have some hard choices to make."
38345,Sheldon,impressive that you know that. it’s hard to believe i’m actually having this conversation with you.
35311,Sheldon,you’re asking me to keep a secret?
41355,Sheldon,but we haven’t finished the puzzle.
38125,Sheldon,"jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. in this iteration, jennifer connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of russell crowe in a beautiful mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one."
45450,Sheldon,"oh, so many things. her mind, her kindness, and especially her body."
37512,Sheldon,"well, yes, but i found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure."
41041,Sheldon,"well, that’s a fine how-do-you-do. don’t just stand there. take your breasts out."
34610,Sheldon,"if he understands that, you’re in trouble. "
45379,Sheldon,"well, perhaps i am a little under the weather. it’s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can’t fix."
39330,Sheldon,"oh, did you hear that? we’re getting the friends and family discount. we are honoured and we will take it."
36206,Sheldon,"excuse me, but the problem is not solved. if your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?"
21825,Sheldon,roommates agree that friday nights shall be reserved for watching joss whedon’s brilliant new series firefly.
45577,Sheldon,"leonard, your wife is sitting right here. what are you doing?"
40316,Sheldon,"no, that’s my potty training journal."
40346,Sheldon,the original title was “a rederivation of maxwell’s equations regarding electromagnetism”” i dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say i was a witch.
35195,Sheldon,"for the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of bertram forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum. "
43644,Sheldon,"well, but where does he get the helium?"
45210,Sheldon,of course. 
45096,Sheldon,"well, it certainly would be easier. you have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues."
43904,Sheldon,neither do i. but we can find out together.
44391,Sheldon,"and last but not least, this is one that i like to call star wars toast because it has a light side and a dark side. all righty, it’s time for dungeons & dragons."
21855,Sheldon,"oh. well, in that case, i don’t need my jacket. and for the record, the correct syntax is i’m the guy from whom you’re trying to get away. oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. "
41838,Sheldon,"bring it home, mufasa. eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh."
40859,Sheldon,no. it’s not the message.
43821,Sheldon,there was a project i’ve been thinking about starting.
37020,Sheldon,"well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash."
42550,Sheldon,he doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. he combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
45375,Sheldon,i’m fine.
40929,Sheldon,would it help if i gave him some pointers? i’m just funnin’ ya.
34818,Sheldon,"and you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration."
42292,Sheldon,"leonard, i am overwhelmed. everything is changing and it’s simply too much. i need to get away and think."
37057,Sheldon,episodes of sub psychotic rage.
42685,Sheldon,you bet your sweet b i won’t.
40212,Sheldon,you didn’t have to do that.
38744,Sheldon,"hold on, i have something for you."
43756,Sheldon,"45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. you know, probably half that if i break out the old cow eyes."
42001,Sheldon,i saw you having naked sex.
37003,Sheldon,"and good evening to you, siam palace. this is sheldon cooper. yeah, i’m going to be dining alone this evening, so i’ll be reducing my usual order. i’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, king rama iv of siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of europe in order to preserve his throne. surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings."
37198,Sheldon,i don’t blame you. you were intoxicated.
37297,Sheldon,i heard a noise.
42515,Sheldon,i think you mean positive punishment. negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. it’s a common mistake.
44832,Sheldon,ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art german incubator.
36948,Sheldon,"come on, leonard, if you roll a six, penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. see what i mean when i say the fun is real?"
37604,Sheldon,"thanks, shorty,i’ll take it from here. all right, you people ready to have some fun? you have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? well, then here come the jokes. why did the chicken cross the mobius strip? to get to the same side, bazinga! all right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? the bartender says, for you, no charge. hello? i know you’re out there. i can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. dr. randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. ba-da cha! i kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause i have no respect for the field. let’s get serious for a moment. why are we all here? ‘cause we’re scientists. and what do scientists study? the universe. and what’s the universe made of? i am so glad you asked.  there’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,"
45216,Sheldon,"excuse me. may i have your attention, please? i have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with amy farrah fowler has become water cooler gossip. and i just want to say, shame on all of you. we’re scientists. our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people’s lives."
35464,Sheldon,"they make up a non-newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker."
34742,Sheldon,"how would i know, do you have a low sperm count?"
41404,Sheldon,thank you.
41125,Sheldon,"there anything i can get for you? some apple juice? uh, some jell-o?"
43534,Sheldon,so that’s all this day was? a plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?
45464,Sheldon,"i started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and i came across an area of research called super-aging."
21823,Sheldon,do you do this often?
39088,Sheldon,"yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. if he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines."
42309,Sheldon,"well, maybe you should. there’s lots of books called sherlock holmes, and there’s no books called officer hernandez."
36482,Sheldon,where?
36431,Sheldon,i need it for my robin collection.
44245,Sheldon,we’d have to take your car.
41490,Sheldon,"yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. my calculations were wrong. there must be some resonance between the elements i didn’t know about."
42160,Sheldon,"you can’t be serious. if i wanted to waste my time on nonsense, i’d follow leonard on instagram."
43887,Sheldon,"oh, sure. well, you’re fun to look at."
35767,Sheldon,"leonard, she’s in my spot."
39204,Sheldon,"penny’s brain teaser this morning. she and koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. she is dishevelled, and raj is dressed only in a sheet. the sole clue, it’s not what it looks like."
40315,Sheldon,"yeah, it’s journals and research papers i wrote as a child."
42526,Sheldon,now i’ve got room for another thing. what do you want?
43969,Sheldon,"well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you."
42305,Sheldon,hurry.
35163,Sheldon,"so there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself. "
42139,Sheldon,"well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?"
44695,Sheldon,"i’d say wise beyond your years, but you’re getting up there."
41507,Sheldon,she might be contagious. don’t you think i’m having a rough enough day?
44913,Sheldon,"yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, i can hang it right now."
44378,Sheldon,"oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury."
38332,Sheldon,alcohol.
37115,Sheldon,then speak.
44262,Sheldon,like what?
42409,Sheldon,"if you’re free tomorrow night, i’d love to have you join us on a double date."
43282,Sheldon,you see where i’m going with this.
37073,Sheldon,hello.
34868,Sheldon,"sadly, it’s not. substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that i have realised that the leo i described would not have agreed to go to rehab."
43341,Sheldon,it is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
41935,Sheldon,i don’t need to explain myself to you!
39597,Sheldon,i got a splinter.
42086,Sheldon,"okay. well, what do you do?"
44824,Sheldon,"yeah, but us monkeys doesn’t pop. oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. hey, when can we start running tests on it?"
40479,Sheldon,"yeah, i did, but then wil called amy a pain in the a-s-s. she got huffy and left, then wil and i headed out to dinner. that place really did remind me of my hometown. because there we also have a hometown buffet."
36286,Sheldon,"fine! smoot-cooper. wow, what a diva."
35536,Sheldon,i had not considered that.
36070,Sheldon,"alright kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and i would like to propose that we do that together. tomorrow. yes, i’ll pay. alright, goodbye. alright! time to learn rock climbing."
37229,Sheldon,okay. what is your game?
34428,Sheldon,nothing.
41296,Sheldon,"amy, there were chinese food containers in the trash can."
36839,Sheldon,"in this context, with me means for me."
34952,Sheldon,i’m very congested. 
40967,Sheldon,"please, leonard, he said it’s okay."
43116,Sheldon,is it my fault i have a much bigger reputation than he does?
44906,Sheldon,"oh, actually, i would."
21857,Sheldon,"you don’t see your mistake, do you?"
35427,Sheldon,oh now you’re just making stuff up.
42858,Sheldon,"well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. you know, who has the best cervix. which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. men’s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them."
36846,Sheldon,i am in every way.
36695,Sheldon,"if that’s morse code, that’s terrible. as i was saying, you and leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. earlier this evening, leonard characterized it as just fine. so what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed."
43876,Sheldon,that i have coitus with her.
34586,Sheldon,that’s as far as i’ve gotten.
40221,Sheldon,"boldly go, howard wolowitz."
40609,Sheldon," amy. i made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. additionally, you are my girlfriend, and i care about your well-being."
41194,Sheldon,how?
21841,Sheldon,"i put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny."
43364,Sheldon,"yeah. exactly. you know, i waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly."
40660,Sheldon,"oh, don’t be silly. christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. why is this so important to you?"
39029,Sheldon,shotgun.
40422,Sheldon,"and if they ever come out with a game called words with people you once worked with, you’ll be off to the races."
29522,Sheldon,"greetings. as you know, i’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so i prepared this short video. the four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. though i cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, i am comfortable if you choose to believe that. since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. live long and prosper."
45347,Sheldon,"well, if that’s the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture."
45480,Sheldon,i hurt myself juggling.
42325,Sheldon,i called leonard because i failed. and i didn’t want you to think less of me.
37793,Sheldon,vocal test. morning vocal test. second vocal test. second morning vocal test.
44097,Sheldon,"i suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. and speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former soviet union. hubba, hubba."
39149,Sheldon,"pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses."
41240,Sheldon,"oh, no, i don’t think that’s true at all."
41894,Sheldon,"i’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right."
39047,Sheldon,thank you. is someone smoking?
41169,Sheldon,what do you do?
36318,Sheldon,all right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
35217,Sheldon,"yes, but they have dvd burners over here. leonard needs a dvd burner. "
36189,Sheldon,"the mrow, that sounded to me like an african civet cat."
44431,Sheldon,"stuart, what are you doing here?"
37400,Sheldon,is that your final decision?
37979,Sheldon,do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an ipod?
38871,Sheldon,"i’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched. by the way, if you hope to have children, i suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. your testicles look a tad warm."
42593,Sheldon,i’m still upset about that peanut sauce.
40229,Sheldon,attaboy!
38056,Sheldon,"you don’t have to sell me on cats, leonard. i’m already a fan. all right, fellas, who’s in the mood for fancy feast? well, that’s not fancy at all."
40902,Sheldon,interesting. a few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. perhaps that isn’t the compliment it sounds like.
39728,Sheldon,"leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because i am very, very hungry."
35396,Sheldon,"what if i choke on my popcorn, who will administer the heimlich manoeuvre."
35824,Sheldon,where are you going?
42589,Sheldon,"well, now, don’t get defensive. you’re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl."
39470,Sheldon,"oh, no! i can’t!"
38769,Sheldon,hello.
34354,Sheldon,i may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.
39280,Sheldon,"oh, well, then i guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. all right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt."
41934,Sheldon,um.
36590,Sheldon, penny.
39779,Sheldon,"you’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need? oh, where’d the magic go?"
38669,Sheldon,nothing. i was acting.
35493,Sheldon,"oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males…. oh, i’m too tired to do this."
42918,Sheldon,"hmm. no, not yet."
44758,Sheldon,i’m concerned about amy. she’s acting a bit odd lately.
40378,Sheldon,"no, that’s not fair either."
34603,Sheldon,"and male partners. animal partners. large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. "
44266,Sheldon,thank you. i wouldn’t even know how to begin.
43806,Sheldon,"me, too. it’s comforting to know that she and i are able to function as friends."
41356,Sheldon,"you think you know the answer. but it could be a trick. what if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?"
39106,Sheldon,it was its own point. go on.
39135,Sheldon,is there a station coming up where i can board your giggling train of thought?
35138,Sheldon,"she’s my twin sister, she thinks she’s funny but frankly i’ve never been able to see it."
38546,Sheldon,"oh, i’m, i’m sorry. i assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but i realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men."
37528,Sheldon,i don’t want to hear this.
37303,Sheldon,"fine. good night to you, sir. miss."
43927,Sheldon,"oh, i see. how about now?"
37994,Sheldon,an accident.
34720,Sheldon,and now we’ll never know. 
45010,Sheldon,"well, i was in my room, i couldn’t hear what they were saying."
35349,Sheldon,"yeah, julie newmar, michelle pfieffer, eartha kitt and then her. "
39541,Sheldon,"yes. it should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? not anymore. we’re going to have so much fun together. you can carry messages to all my enemies. i can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite."
39022,Sheldon,no.
42197,Sheldon,i know why. you’ve come to me because you’re my obi-wan.
44837,Sheldon,"uh, no. we lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby."
34748,Sheldon,"we ate. she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing i didn’t already know, and i came home. "
35939,Sheldon,"you’re welcome, leonard."
44762,Sheldon,i don’t understand.
37841,Sheldon,"all right, let me restate that. it’s very heavy, and i don’t want to."
37006,Sheldon, penny..
39375,Sheldon,"frankly, mom, i’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge."
38931,Sheldon,no weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a klingon bat’leth.
40176,Sheldon,what can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny lego indiana jones?
35201,Sheldon,i think a birthday party is a terrible idea. i envy leonard for growing up without that anguish. 
44352,Sheldon,now it’s a fun fact.
41853,Sheldon,"oh, very well. what are the sleeping arrangements? we’ve only been dating for three years. if we were to share a room, people might talk."
45152,Sheldon,you.
41504,Sheldon,that’s the most romantic thing i’ve ever heard.
38893,Sheldon,"yes, glenn! the only bird i ever loved."
35245,Sheldon,how am i supposed to know that? as the teacher it’s your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter. 
36420,Sheldon,fascinating.
42154,Sheldon,"penny, there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems, and that’s an oreo. or a nutter butter, if you’re in a pinch."
40761,Sheldon,nobel. kripke. don’t look at my board.
43499,Sheldon,unhand me. this is ridiculous.
44700,Sheldon,"i know. it’s also why i never open a door without knocking three times. i mean, the first"
34933,Sheldon,"well, of course, but, not by myself. "
35128,Sheldon,you hypocrite!
34385,Sheldon,"that depends. when i learn that i’m a robot, will i be able to handle it?"
39999,Sheldon,"now that you’re in my debt, please manipulate amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party."
35514,Sheldon,"well, what passes for science on dating sites. they claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum."
42042,Sheldon,see? that’s what i thought. but then they go and throw in an esram buffer.
43633,Sheldon,"leonard, if that swedish team beats us, i will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. which is a shame, because swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball."
39705,Sheldon,"again, not enough evidence. for all we know, he’s being murdered. now, back to our game."
39169,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! amy, i’ve never been touched like this before! oh! oh, my hands are magic!"
42675,Sheldon,is he okay?
35141,Sheldon,"the papers could have been mailed, mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn’t she."
43569,Sheldon,"all right, great. just give me one minute, and i’ll get started on a new roommate agreement. yeah. nothing from pratt, we’re good."
34387,Sheldon,of course not. 
43218,Sheldon,"well, wait. what if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?"
36379,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry. well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. next question, are you fertile?"
45472,Sheldon,"for the last time, i am not having a tickle fight with you."
40265,Sheldon,"yeah, of course you do. you’re a girl. you like all kinds of hippy-dippy things."
39885,Sheldon,this is not your office. it hasn’t been assigned yet.
34316,Sheldon,archimedes would be so proud.
41257,Sheldon,here’s something else you don’t know about me. you just hurt my feelings.
40488,Sheldon,"precisely, i didn’t do anything. now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?"
40979,Sheldon,i can’t tell you that. i’m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
42784,Sheldon,they have a man there who understands my personal style.
45335,Sheldon,"biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. oh, i know what i want my treat to be."
43628,Sheldon,did you know that i almost didn’t wear this shirt today?
36325,Sheldon,"you’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. no. the moving assembly line, that was introduced by henry ford in 1908. that innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. i guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your radiohead."
35294,Sheldon,"they were clever, leonard. they exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing. "
36530,Sheldon,you’re not going to answer it?
44437,Sheldon,"i suppose so. but if i get out of the line, i’ll lose my spot."
37682,Sheldon,"he seems all right. although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. oh, but now that i think of it, he asked me not to tell you that."
34935,Sheldon,"no, visiting professor. anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than i’m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of czechoslovakia. "
42604,Sheldon,"we pretend we’re aliens. i’m not the best at reading facial cues, but i’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. now, in the beloved novel hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, an alien named ford prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about earth for the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy."
21804,Sheldon,each more daunting than the last. have a seat.
34559,Sheldon,dancing?
45338,Sheldon,"yeah, the math is so inelegant. i’m not even sure it makes sense."
38977,Sheldon,howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to bernadette.
38034,Sheldon,there being no objections…
45742,Sheldon,"hello to you, too. i’m sorry, but this is important."
34623,Sheldon,"yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break."
41999,Sheldon,"you, aren’t you gonna come with me?"
37439,Sheldon,did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? i’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
44092,Sheldon,"uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of dr. sheldon cooper…"
36790,Sheldon,interesting. sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. i wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
34196,Sheldon,there he is.
34308,Sheldon,you realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
40107,Sheldon,you make sissy on your belt buckles? mee-maw’s forks never had that.
44468,Sheldon,"because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man."
41275,Sheldon,oh.
34236,Sheldon,"oh, come on. who hasn’t seen this differential below “here i sit broken hearted?”"
35057,Sheldon,a sigma particle.
35964,Sheldon,nice motivational speech from the team captain.
42638,Sheldon,but you don’t have a life-threatening condition. why would you take the risk of surgery?
39850,Sheldon,y-you’re being ridiculous. those are perfectly clean.
43511,Sheldon,it is extraordinary.
37343,Sheldon,"you can try, but you’ll never catch me. "
37858,Sheldon,it’s a time of day i invented. it better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. preevning. i’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
34215,Sheldon,evidently.
37985,Sheldon,okay.
40136,Sheldon,"all right, then. thank you, howard. please let professor hawking know that i’m available at his earliest convenience."
43741,Sheldon,"all right, fine, she doesn’t need her own point of view. now, chop-chop."
37820,Sheldon,there you go.
37448,Sheldon,"i don’t trust banks. i believe that when the robots rise up, atms will lead the charge."
35756,Sheldon,why would you do that?
40183,Sheldon,"da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink."
37569,Sheldon,i’m sorry. proceed.
43487,Sheldon,plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in san francisco.
40549,Sheldon,don’t try to change the subject. this is about a parking space. it has nothing to do with cars.
39814,Sheldon,no.
38315,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i don’t recall you saying no backsies.
34519,Sheldon,what does it mean?
43179,Sheldon,"oh, i think that’s below the pay grade of an imperial officer. stormtroopers are really the ones who…"
36381,Sheldon,"if that changes, let me know. and finally, area rugs, pro or con?"
36680,Sheldon,they’re not my friends.
42643,Sheldon,i don’t. i’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo.
43015,Sheldon,you sure it’s not too much bible juice?
39439,Sheldon,droll.
37607,Sheldon,what do i search?
39290,Sheldon,"all this years, i’ve been so wrong. the tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun."
38339,Sheldon,all right. to the metric system.  i can’t taste the cherries.
45034,Sheldon,to this day i’ve never touched stuart.
41058,Sheldon,answer honestly. this is not a trial. that’ll come later.
44213,Sheldon,you’re tying my hands here.
37108,Sheldon,"yes. leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  while i appreciate the oh, snap, i’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear."
43918,Sheldon,that’s the one to beat. leonard?
34869,Sheldon,because leo is a middle child. 
42668,Sheldon,amy. what’s going on?
36250,Sheldon,all right.
40736,Sheldon,"i know mr. data isn’t supposed to smile, but here it comes."
34378,Sheldon,"wooh, i’m all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, i just built a virtual pool."
36958,Sheldon,"hint, madame curie had her husband to help her."
34575,Sheldon,so what time does the costume parade start? 
40396,Sheldon,what kind of tea would you like?
42577,Sheldon,"uh, extra peanut sauce?"
34340,Sheldon,i just gave you a reasonable explanation.
37998,Sheldon,"i’m coming, woz, i’m coming.  ow! aw."
44454,Sheldon,mrs. wunch in fourth grade. and my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great.
42511,Sheldon,"wait, a question, who decides if someone’s gone off topic?"
35451,Sheldon,make yourself comfortable.  sheldor is back online.
36920,Sheldon,"that’s exactly what my father said. come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time i was five until i went off to college. longest seven years of my life."
36769,Sheldon,"bazinga! none of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?"
40518,Sheldon,it’s a hypothetical containment field for a frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
39702,Sheldon,"now, where were we? oh, yes. does anyone have any wood? oh, come on! i just want wood. why are you making it so hard?"
45139,Sheldon,keep filling this one with babies. she’s good.
37056,Sheldon,"i’ll put, in progress. okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera."
36804,Sheldon,elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
42259,Sheldon,where are you going to go?
43543,Sheldon,"gandalf, but he’s a smoker."
34372,Sheldon,good lord!
44823,Sheldon,"i have such a profound sense of creation. i, it’s like when i hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my dna, so this is like me monkeys. "
41488,Sheldon,"this table, it’s in square centimetres. i read it as square metres. you know what that means?"
45050,Sheldon,"well, i’m just playing tennis against the drapes here."
38630,Sheldon,leonard.
35265,Sheldon,"well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in fantasia. "
35086,Sheldon,"i’ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that? "
41927,Sheldon,how do i know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation?
36039,Sheldon,"you got it, buddy."
36587,Sheldon, penny.
35008,Sheldon,"i really don’t understand your objections, professor goldfarb, why wouldn’t the senoran desert make a perfectly good promised land?"
43412,Sheldon,"oh, you’re going to a wedding alone? that’s sad."
40550,Sheldon,"i always listen to myself. it’s one of the great joys of my life. now, get your car out of my spot."
44377,Sheldon,"oh, no bubble baths either. they can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection."
37488,Sheldon,please tell the judge i’m ready to apologize.
37593,Sheldon,and how did that make you feel?
41345,Sheldon,"oh, everything i could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt."
37805,Sheldon,the implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
42106,Sheldon,have you considered studying standard model physics?
43501,Sheldon,it runs on syphilis?
38435,Sheldon,who?
37597,Sheldon,"if someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, i think i can face a simple award ceremony."
40383,Sheldon,"for goodness’ sake, he’s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt."
40472,Sheldon,really? he reminded me of a young william shatner.
34466,Sheldon,"well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years."
45659,Sheldon,‘cause i sold my soul to the company store.
41022,Sheldon,it’s too late. get ready to like me.
35242,Sheldon,wo de zhing shi sheldon.
39414,Sheldon,"no. or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh."
39163,Sheldon,it’s a little stiff. what a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. not unlike balancing a faberge egg on a pixie stick.
43383,Sheldon,"so you’re never getting married? it’s his whining, isn’t it?"
34501,Sheldon,"we don’t eat here, i don’t know what’s good."
36270,Sheldon,it’s sheldon.
45060,Sheldon,and it’s just the way you like it.
41608,Sheldon,"oh, oh, oh, i have a reason. it could be because you said yes to marrying zack, but every time leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. yeah, that’s just off the top of my head."
41993,Sheldon,no.
37197,Sheldon,you’re very welcome.
43739,Sheldon,gentlemen.
35150,Sheldon,is that what that was? i just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical. 
44182,Sheldon,"you know, i used to hate these hugs. now they’re just extremely irritating."
43728,Sheldon,those are very wise words.
38217,Sheldon,yes.
39361,Sheldon,"oh, good. you picked me, you picked me."
39232,Sheldon,"oh, yes, priya. leonard, you know i make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs."
34654,Sheldon,"it’s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. it serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders."
45008,Sheldon,"well, this is highly insulting."
38611,Sheldon,"algorithm. you see, penny, alan turing defined an algorithm…"
38717,Sheldon,ugh!
41322,Sheldon,keep it up?
37390,Sheldon,but penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
34653,Sheldon,your head goes on the other end.
39531,Sheldon,"it’s not a death ray. it’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. trust me, if i had a death ray, i wouldn’t be living here. i’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of earth gave me for not using my death ray. all right, and in three, two, one. "
45566,Sheldon,"yeah. raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"
44275,Sheldon,but i feel like i could reach out and touch you.
44948,Sheldon,dividing our belongings is difficult.
45441,Sheldon,your first date? did you even measure her walls?
38815,Sheldon,leonard the nucleus? that makes no sense. i’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.
38958,Sheldon,"yeah, but not your books. something they might enjoy. i kid, of course. big fan."
38128,Sheldon,"no point. it’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. what makes you chuckle, leonard?"
45391,Sheldon,what’s the big deal? it’s full of classified information about the air force project.
38814,Sheldon,cluck-cluck-cluck.
37377,Sheldon,nope.
41903,Sheldon,"it’s a made-up story, leonard, i don’t even know why you’re talking about it."
38881,Sheldon,that does it. i’m getting uranium.
37717,Sheldon,"do you have a stomach ache, too?"
45798,Sheldon,obviously. i don’t even have water yet.
38244,Sheldon,you know i can’t keep a secret.
36639,Sheldon,"of course, i can’t mention you in my nobel acceptance speech, but when i get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy."
45114,Sheldon,"oh, ooh! and that makes leonard angry."
39451,Sheldon,"hello, howard. i’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. allow me to say, job well done.  perfect."
43713,Sheldon,"yes. oh, for example, three years ago when i discovered penny was eating all my pop-tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, i got a floor safe."
35153,Sheldon,"excuse me, can i interject something. i’m ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni? "
43382,Sheldon,"ah, well, very well. so does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?"
42758,Sheldon,"oh, not just something, no. it’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and i swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it."
39371,Sheldon,"brent spiner, what have you done? that was an original mint-in-package wesley crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, wil wheaton."
43456,Sheldon,"me neither. but i just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems."
41204,Sheldon,"it’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of leonard’s face in it. he got it at the mall on clearance. now move, move, move."
42183,Sheldon,"all those people blowing their noses. you can’t tell the sick from the sad. mm. i’ll be at home celebrating star wars day, as planned."
42033,Sheldon,"i’m not being stupid. i’m employing the work of dutch researcher, mirjam tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions."
39259,Sheldon,you have to get rid of the chair.
36520,Sheldon,"oh, good, you’re finally home."
42179,Sheldon,"but, that’s star wars day."
40028,Sheldon,it’s like looking at the universe naked.  
36501,Sheldon,"i really have no idea. i don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language…"
35900,Sheldon,great. new topic. where are you in your menstrual cycle?
37846,Sheldon,"when one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. i’m making english muffins. would you like an english muffin?"
40502,Sheldon,my problem is i’m out of tea.
36546,Sheldon,it won’t work. no way to mount it.
44278,Sheldon,"i was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face."
43518,Sheldon,"right. archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and i shall move the world."
43342,Sheldon,"oh, it’s all right. she’ll forgive you. she has to or she goes to hell."
43158,Sheldon,why not?
40749,Sheldon,"hello. hello. uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. anything for you guys?"
42665,Sheldon,you’re acting odd. why?
38311,Sheldon,"that seems fairly conclusive.  no, gorn, no. that’s where i sit."
41104,Sheldon,look at me. i can get as close to you as i want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.
40211,Sheldon,what do you see in her?
41816,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i have the solution to our comic-con problem. we don’t need them. i’m starting my own convention."
35186,Sheldon,"okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. "
40987,Sheldon,"sorry, badgering me won’t work. what you should have said is, it’s pointless to keep this a secret because penny will tell us."
40611,Sheldon,102.2. exactly what it was half an hour ago. it’s like you’re not even trying to get better.
41430,Sheldon,"howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with sheldon misunderstood. that’s a dead giveaway."
39013,Sheldon,"very well. count the first, on or about the 28th day of april, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens."
35321,Sheldon,"i just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir. "
44112,Sheldon,"oh, i heard about that. why didn’t you discover it?"
43891,Sheldon,"okay. ooh, this is different, hmm? candles and music."
41604,Sheldon,he’s right.
35293,Sheldon,"you sound surprised. mmm, hou zi shui zai li du.  "
44075,Sheldon,"no, i wouldn’t."
38772,Sheldon,"that’s remarkable. if pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace german shepherds at our nation’s airports."
40462,Sheldon,"oh, me, too."
39059,Sheldon,fascinating.
37133,Sheldon,"hush. if you have questions, raise your hand. it’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 bc, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. there you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. yes, penny?"
37872,Sheldon,interesting. my mother and i have the same agreement about church.
37185,Sheldon, leonard?
39347,Sheldon,mohammed lee.
39538,Sheldon,"i did it! i actually did it. okay, now flush him."
39930,Sheldon,hello. i’m here for my haircut with mr. d’onofrio.
40032,Sheldon,interrupting physicist.
40066,Sheldon,i can’t because that was a lie. yours was broken in an earthquake. and that’s a lie.
34914,Sheldon,what else would i drink? gasses? solids? ionised plasma?
40946,Sheldon,"no, you’re a tool i was using to make my point."
42968,Sheldon,"well, excuse me, amy was testing you. i was rooting for you. good job on that banana box, by the way."
36875,Sheldon,excuse me. are you saying that wil wheaton aka ensign wesley crusher on star trek:
37567,Sheldon,"when i was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me."
38296,Sheldon,very well. would you be interested in knowing that mr. wolowitz once snuck onto my world of warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from sheldor to smeldor?
36606,Sheldon,and begin.
35366,Sheldon,"it was rife with historical inaccuracies. for example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously germanic, but in 1487 the bavarian purity laws or rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. at best they would have had some sort of spiced wine."
36333,Sheldon,let’s think out of the box for a moment. how about a molecular sieve?
35126,Sheldon,what’s the exchange rate.
34239,Sheldon,"um, penny, that’s where i sit."
36643,Sheldon,"if this is about the night the heat went out, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about."
38820,Sheldon,"please, leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends."
39826,Sheldon,"oh, president siebert, i assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions i put in the box by your office."
35834,Sheldon,doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?
42535,Sheldon,"well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines."
39010,Sheldon, penny?
36960,Sheldon,i can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.
42539,Sheldon,"yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, i know."
37864,Sheldon,i don’t drink coffee.
37419,Sheldon,very well. enjoy yourself. you’re going to be in the presence of something that i’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. i just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
42354,Sheldon,what a stupid question.
41792,Sheldon,"because he’s not like us, penny. we’re dreamers."
40370,Sheldon,don’t know.
45079,Sheldon,"i get to write a contract? i say, let’s get this party of the first part started."
38060,Sheldon,what are you doing here?
37940,Sheldon,curses.
41243,Sheldon,yes.
34194,Sheldon, leonard…
45746,Sheldon,"yes, i’m starting my own comic book convention, and i thought that your client, robert downey jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. oh, well, now, why are you saying no? you haven’t even asked him yet. you know, excuse me, but i sat through iron man 2. i believe he owes me two hours of his time. they hung up on me."
37060,Sheldon,"now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. try not to choke on your own drool."
35377,Sheldon,you’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. mud.
36241,Sheldon,"gentlemen, this is the coast starlight, one of the great american trains operating on one of the classic american routes. on this side, you’ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you’ll be treated to 350 miles of costcos, jiffy lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools."
36917,Sheldon,"if you’re interested, i also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken."
37036,Sheldon,didn’t work out well.
38062,Sheldon,"i do not agree. cats make wonderful companions. they don’t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, i think you’ll find to be quite zazzy."
39144,Sheldon,a heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.
36287,Sheldon,"despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, i must forfeit."
39014,Sheldon,"um, it’s fairly technical."
36352,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, coffee’s out of the question. when i moved to california, i promised my mother that i wouldn’t start doing drugs."
34263,Sheldon,that woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.
37947,Sheldon,killed by badger.
40004,Sheldon,i’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
43272,Sheldon,"no, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?"
37482,Sheldon,"really? i would point out that i am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours."
41784,Sheldon,wow. didn’t see that coming.
38682,Sheldon,you do?
36548,Sheldon,you’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
42516,Sheldon,"oh, it’s used incorrectly all the time. even bill murray makes that mistake in the first scene of ghostbusters."
43702,Sheldon,yeah. you don’t have to tell me.
37997,Sheldon,section 74.c. the various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
39124,Sheldon,"to the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. gang way! dead man walking!"
45559,Sheldon,that’s the only kind of admonishing i do.
37505,Sheldon,"who’s adam west? leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?"
36675,Sheldon,bread.
36593,Sheldon,i need access to the cheesecake factory’s walk-in freezer.
35956,Sheldon,i think we can safely assume that all kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet krypton exploded.
41173,Sheldon,"oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt."
37968,Sheldon,"well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are hirschsprung’s disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms."
42735,Sheldon,"ugh. english pudding. you get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. i’m not going."
34229,Sheldon,hi.
34998,Sheldon,yes.
42769,Sheldon,"oh, no, we’ll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours."
36367,Sheldon,"hold on. you honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?"
39640,Sheldon,you’re soft. this world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.
35969,Sheldon,why would you do such a thing?
36390,Sheldon,"congratulations, i see you did your laundry."
35414,Sheldon,"penny, hold on. are you sure things can’t work out with you and leonard?"
39535,Sheldon,"no, bernadette, don’t be a hero!"
40920,Sheldon,"oh, so many crazy rules."
35958,Sheldon,superman would have taken his uniform to a kandorian dry cleaner before he left the bottle.
34240,Sheldon,"no, i sit there."
44035,Sheldon,"that’s me. bye, stuart."
36789,Sheldon,thank you. 
42393,Sheldon,"you’re not going to do that, and i’ll tell you why. this is an institution of higher learning, i am your professor, and you’re going to treat me with the prop… you shot your spit in my mouth!"
36419,Sheldon,"the one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? n equals r times fp times ne times fl times fi times fc times l?"
36759,Sheldon,"i can’t be impossible. i exist. i believe what you meant to say is, “i give up, he’s improbable.”"
39774,Sheldon,"all right. that’s it. we are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. we are now merely acquaintances. to amend the words of toy story, you have not got a friend in me."
43418,Sheldon,"well, you should know that she recently broke up with me."
35933,Sheldon,"at least take this with you. look, and have stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. this states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve."
43431,Sheldon,wasn’t mary magdalene a woman of ill repute?
35272,Sheldon,"the last one worked out well for koothrappali. he got a free ipod. oh, glare! "
40079,Sheldon,"um, to go to jewish heaven?"
39148,Sheldon,"howard, i have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home."
43088,Sheldon,grass is always greener?
40144,Sheldon,"i wish you could all be inside my head. the conversation is sparkling.  fine, i’ll tell you. a lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. if you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? hint, there is a right answer. none of you will get it."
38207,Sheldon,drop axe. brilliant.
34581,Sheldon,telepathically?
38689,Sheldon,i’m glad you asked. i took the liberty of adapting a star trek fan fiction novella i wrote when i was ten into a one-act play.
41574,Sheldon,you say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. i say situations like this make me feel the same way. 
36181,Sheldon,"the pharmacology department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids."
43822,Sheldon,i’ll show you.  everyody cut footloose. nope.
36853,Sheldon,i reject them all.
37438,Sheldon,"not my problem. i just don’t understand how this happened to me. i’m scrupulous about my hygiene. i regularly disinfect my hands, and i avoid contact with other people on general principle."
44109,Sheldon,congratulations on a successful live show.
42927,Sheldon,"i told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere."
35601,Sheldon,leonard takes los robles avenue.
44941,Sheldon,"so, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, i see you’ve met theodore. theodore, these are your new room mates, leonard and penny. they’re very honest, but i would not leave cash lying around."
35364,Sheldon,"i know, most of your work is extremely derivative. don’t worry, that’s not a secret. everybody knows. "
39462,Sheldon,"it’s me, sheldon, mrs. wolowitz."
39770,Sheldon,"well, it has. ask anybody."
42461,Sheldon,i’m sure she did.
42480,Sheldon,i’m not going to a cabin in the woods. did you see the movie cabin in the woods?
35117,Sheldon,"in addition, your premise is flawed. in the original film, rod taylor got yvette mimeaux with that very time machine. in back to the future, marty mcfly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. "
39815,Sheldon,of course you get a card. it’s leonard’s day.
37753,Sheldon,i’ve heard enough. sit over there.
41241,Sheldon,"well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. is that it? did i get it right?"
34979,Sheldon,"yes. that’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent asian wunderkind. he ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die. "
35235,Sheldon,it depends on what bus you have.
42533,Sheldon,"well, i’ll just google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up."
41800,Sheldon,good. now we’re getting somewhere.
35757,Sheldon,the big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
34946,Sheldon,my mom used to sing it to me when i was sick.
38759,Sheldon,what’s going on?
42296,Sheldon,yes?
36384,Sheldon,"alicia’s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. she’s still on probation, of course, but i like her."
35675,Sheldon,what a nice girl.
37565,Sheldon,"and yet, you can’t speak to women."
42585,Sheldon,"oh, god. don’t make it so hard on her. look, the first someone is the deceitful you. the second someone is the delightful dr. lorvis."
43986,Sheldon,ugh. stuart.
38474,Sheldon,what are you doing?
44254,Sheldon,i have a ziploc bag filled with all my old ziploc bags.
45009,Sheldon,"i’m the child she was worried about? i have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock, if i spotted them the potato."
36011,Sheldon,"have faith, gentlemen. we don’t need wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. watch and learn. do either of you know how to open the toolbox?"
40413,Sheldon,"no, i don’t think so. those dolls represent three things i do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. i think it’s a lost cause."
40772,Sheldon,how do i know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
38926,Sheldon,"i almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the san diego freeway at 71 miles an hour. ease up there, lead foot. you trying to get us killed?"
35846,Sheldon,"all right, but i’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat."
43363,Sheldon,"oh, no, not just a season. if i’m in, i’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines."
43584,Sheldon,"excuse me, barry?"
43703,Sheldon,not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. so we are currently in the presence of leonard nimoy’s dna.
42476,Sheldon,"why, die. why did he die? old, told. i was told he was old."
39298,Sheldon,"the entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. you manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. what do you do?"
41783,Sheldon,okay. i’m inside the cern super collider.
44474,Sheldon,"yeah, and leonard’s mother’s already here."
21831,Sheldon,i’m just going to keep knocking till you answer.  leonard?
39074,Sheldon,"good morning, amy."
41660,Sheldon,"that’s what makes their friendship unlikely,"
43108,Sheldon,i did.
45076,Sheldon,"do they know it’s there? i mean, should i tell somebody? "
37317,Sheldon,i’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
43827,Sheldon,"oh, no, he’s drinking it."
41168,Sheldon,"i believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. while the others pillage the corpse, i lead you to a secluded area where i attempt to remove your leather armour.  it comes off."
43183,Sheldon,"uh, one question about that picture. can it be with george lucas? ooh, grumpy you are."
35044,Sheldon,why?
35326,Sheldon,"i’m constitutionally incapable. that’s why i was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of travers city, michigan. which you did not hear about from me. "
43100,Sheldon,they didn’t mention you in the article. only me.
36900,Sheldon,"no. i came here to defeat wil wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. but i can’t defeat wil wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. enchanted bunny."
37135,Sheldon,"yeah, give or take. as i was saying, it’s a warm summer evening in ancient greece… yes, penny?"
41064,Sheldon,"that show ended with all the residents of new york either dead or unconscious. oh, now i’ll never know what happened."
45274,Sheldon,"i mean, it’s unfair; people just assume i’m going to be upset by raj moving into my old room."
41928,Sheldon,"okay. i’m sorry i gave you such a hard time, i just had to be sure."
39766,Sheldon,you can’t go home. you have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock.
35334,Sheldon,"excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of menushya yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the hindu householder? "
45463,Sheldon,boy teenagers.
42231,Sheldon,"no, i do. you’re upset about emily and you’re indian. i need to make you chai tea. now, i have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. do you happen to have any on you?"
45634,Sheldon,this is not a tangerine bicycle. 
37746,Sheldon,i can still eat.
43726,Sheldon,"i’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. and if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. and if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran."
44235,Sheldon,you wouldn’t.
37469,Sheldon,"wait, hold on. before we get to the courthouse, i’d like to call on your skills as an actress."
44190,Sheldon,couple of questions about the plaque.
36120,Sheldon,ask me why.
42719,Sheldon,"you heard him, leonard. no, it’s not racist."
41531,Sheldon,what?
44194,Sheldon,"it sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order."
34490,Sheldon,no.
42185,Sheldon,"if we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight."
45312,Sheldon,"oh, very well. what have you been working on? and feel free to honk during the boring parts."
39731,Sheldon,"no, can’t do it. sorry, quinto, you’re going back."
39846,Sheldon,"wash those bea… oh, i get it, a little hazing for the new fella. yeah, i’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?"
35991,Sheldon,do you realize what this means? all i need is a healthy ovum and i can grow my own leonard nimoy!
38981,Sheldon,your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. how might we examine this more closely?
41325,Sheldon,you don’t get a hey. you get a hmm.
39472,Sheldon,"oh, god! one, two, three!"
41283,Sheldon,of course. ask a silly question. 
38085,Sheldon,you’re two for two.
39378,Sheldon,of course she does. making me food is her way of saying i love you. making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying i really love you.
43376,Sheldon,things are good right now.
38195,Sheldon,"well then apparently, you hate fun."
38035,Sheldon,"the motion carries. good day, amy farrah fowler."
37009,Sheldon,not surprising. you have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
39806,Sheldon,"this is a bunsen burner. i’m a scientist, i know what i’m doing. oh, drat.  aw. it took me a gallon of urine to make that water."
42627,Sheldon,were you hoping we would because it’s prom?
44596,Sheldon,"yeah, but i do."
42116,Sheldon,not so good.
43241,Sheldon,"oh, sorry. that’s not on the list."
45467,Sheldon,jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha.  
43045,Sheldon,"no. it’s true. it means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile."
41196,Sheldon,"um, can i have your attention, everyone?  that’s, uh, b-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. i would like to propose a toast to my best friend, dr. leonard hofstadter. he has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and i couldn’t be happier for him."
41572,Sheldon,you wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way i feel.
38149,Sheldon,let’s make that our word of the day.
34681,Sheldon,"yes. penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our halo team. i don’t think i need to tell you what an honour this is. "
37269,Sheldon,"oh, my goodness. where do i begin? for instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem."
38398,Sheldon,"don’t worry, wil wheaton. i was just leaving.  da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
38088,Sheldon,that’s ridiculous.
44710,Sheldon,"amy farrah fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?"
39283,Sheldon,"i’ll let you know after tonight. unlike some people, i’m going in with an open mind. who am i kidding? of course we all know it’s o-gauge or no gauge."
39173,Sheldon,"no, i can’t authorize that."
36858,Sheldon,"given the cards that have already been played, penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. the cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of osiris."
42402,Sheldon,oh! it’s not even easter time. this is crazy.
43621,Sheldon,"leonard, i’ve got terrible news."
44855,Sheldon,"someone call george r. r. martin, this guy knows how to finish a story."
40744,Sheldon,"what, you think just because you’re wearing a captain’s uniform, you’re in charge?"
39660,Sheldon,"well, that’s odd. we both washed up when we came in. it’s probably a euphemism for urination."
40399,Sheldon,"oh, oh, on the contrary. couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. now imagine this, you and i entering stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see america’s most beloved and glamorous couple."
38496,Sheldon,complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. invisible plane sold separately.
43441,Sheldon,"oh, you’re right. i could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with leonard."
35573,Sheldon,he should share our love of technology.
40331,Sheldon,"hearing unimpaired, good."
42297,Sheldon,of course you are.
38544,Sheldon,this diagram. i assume you were opening with a joke. it certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps.
45325,Sheldon,i believe i’ve made some progress on our ground rules.
40400,Sheldon,r2-d2 and c-3po. dibs on threepio.
38240,Sheldon,and me.
43497,Sheldon,you’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?
40314,Sheldon,"yeah, wait, here. for your troubles."
42893,Sheldon,"not at all. in fact, i have got something for just such an occasion. i was starting to think i might never get a chance to give it to you. good job."
44716,Sheldon,"yes. oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. or possibly penguins. her english is atrocious."
45205,Sheldon,"not exactly the welcome wagon, but i’ll take it."
41306,Sheldon,"well, leonard, i think it’s high time you and i address the tweepadock in the room."
37404,Sheldon,"round two, leonard hofstadter, darth vader, rupert murdoch."
40702,Sheldon,"oh, yes. yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. all she did was get mad at you."
37350,Sheldon,"no, no, i’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but i figured out how to figure it out."
38711,Sheldon,"perhaps he’s emulating shakespeare’s henry v, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. course, if he’d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails i’ve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble."
38490,Sheldon,"to that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare best group costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly leonard as superman."
35889,Sheldon,"again, urban slang. in which, i believe i’m gaining remarkable fluency. so, what is the down and the low? and don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom."
42387,Sheldon,"ha! i knew it. all right. we have a lot of information to cover before your first test. which, by the way, is in eight minutes. the good news is i’m grading on a curve, so you’re pretty much guaranteed a c."
43270,Sheldon,"i sure did. oh, my goodness. well, from jabba’s head to ice cream with darth vader, i’m having a heck of a ride. yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when i’m in charge. now, why don’t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?"
39251,Sheldon,name one time i’ve ever done that.
42842,Sheldon,thank you.
41032,Sheldon,okay.
44833,Sheldon,"okay, fine. let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. although, we didn’t need to have sex with howard for ours, so we win."
34718,Sheldon,a cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
43262,Sheldon,"bah, you didn’t say building on. you’re out."
42859,Sheldon,"and how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated, cranky and crampy? continue."
43669,Sheldon,"well, you can’t be sure of that. what if the helium dealer rats us out? what if kripke asks where we got it? what if the university checks my family tree and finds out i don’t have an uncle harvey?"
37199,Sheldon,i blame penny.
36170,Sheldon,"oh, i can’t believe that."
36335,Sheldon,"oh, great. raj, why don’t you and howard go get the charcoal? leonard, why don’t you start working on some preliminary web site designs. i’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process."
43244,Sheldon,"i’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. earlier today, it was pointed out to me that i tend to force my ideas on people."
21859,Sheldon,not correctly.
44586,Sheldon,"no, i can do this. i just, i just need another energy drink. oh, no."
41248,Sheldon,"well, i have been toying around with an idea for 4d chess."
35837,Sheldon,hello.
37462,Sheldon,"well, you’re my friends. you’ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when i’m victorious."
44336,Sheldon,all this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.
43402,Sheldon,"did she say anything about me? never mind. i don’t care. well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. just don’t be shocked when you find out that i don’t care."
44658,Sheldon,"no, dr. feynman. if i solve it for you, you’ll never learn."
45201,Sheldon,"i’m not sure of the protocol. television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you’re clearly more sofa-sized."
38904,Sheldon,can we trust him?
45064,Sheldon,"well, what can we do to cheer you up?"
36952,Sheldon,it’s also your roll.
44992,Sheldon,"oh, you know., the lone star state. hmm. that should be its yelp rating."
39837,Sheldon,"hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to lost was filmed. mahalo for nothing, hawaii."
38972,Sheldon,why are you smiling?
45650,Sheldon,"hello, puny insects. as a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike."
43123,Sheldon,"oh, i’m aware. it features whoopi goldberg. she played guinan on star trek: next gen. penny, next gen refers to star trek…"
39584,Sheldon,pardon me. excuse me.
44390,Sheldon,"well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic."
35005,Sheldon,the jewish people.
45510,Sheldon,thank you. can we just talk about something else?
42343,Sheldon,swish.
36989,Sheldon,"because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper."
37171,Sheldon,"if i can interject again. leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. he probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the cheesecake factory menu."
39718,Sheldon,"it’s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. did you?"
42971,Sheldon,"okay, maybe this will help. imagine you’re holding a pen. before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that’ll make the next part really hard."
44462,Sheldon,"excuse me, i paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when i arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. oh, no, no, no, no, wait, i ask you all again, a show of hands. who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he’s gonna get in."
36474,Sheldon,good. i’m glad.
34766,Sheldon,and i forbid it. 
37555,Sheldon,am i in trouble? did my mother call you?
37654,Sheldon,all right.
34198,Sheldon,"don’t stop. yes, keep going. just like that."
42931,Sheldon,"click it with me. one, two, three, click."
34928,Sheldon,then surprise me.  would you call that moss green or forest green? 
41227,Sheldon,"well, i really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus."
38920,Sheldon,sure.
37161,Sheldon,"oh, yes. we had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable santa claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. and to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures."
38957,Sheldon,"have you ever considered trying to do something useful? perhaps, reading to the elderly?"
37560,Sheldon,"that’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into xavier’s school for gifted youngsters, but go on. leonard?"
35594,Sheldon,"typically that’s an indicator. to, you know, check your engine."
42978,Sheldon,that sounds like us. i still don’t understand why you’re upset. you solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.
35184,Sheldon,i weep for humanity. 
44220,Sheldon,"oh, but i like this computer."
40774,Sheldon,fine.
35747,Sheldon,what did they say?
42637,Sheldon,why would you have surgery?
42108,Sheldon,"oh, please. if i wanted to take up a fad, i’d get a tramp stamp."
37293,Sheldon,"what if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?"
38344,Sheldon,captain kirk won.
38612,Sheldon,"since we come in every tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, i believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, how are they hanging?"
40081,Sheldon,"howard, please. this is stephen hawking. perhaps my only intellectual equal."
34327,Sheldon,no.
39521,Sheldon,or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.
35873,Sheldon,"hi, stephanie. i’m sorry i’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation."
39003,Sheldon,i have to skip the chitchat. emergency.
34265,Sheldon,"yes, but not of the same species."
35690,Sheldon,"oh, yes, it’s halo night. let me just dry my tootsies."
36479,Sheldon,"oh, i shall.  no!"
38960,Sheldon,"i know. what an elf i would have made. whoo, what do you think you’re doing?"
35154,Sheldon,"i guess. don’t worry, i was going to order you cheeseless."
41827,Sheldon,"you’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. you’re buying non-transferable tickets. and from a stranger, no less. not only can you get banned from comic-con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. you think about that while i’m warning james earl jones about the danger of posting his location on twitter. he got lucky this time. there are some weirdoes out there.  bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum… "
39724,Sheldon,"you have a keen insight into the human heart, amy farrah fowler."
40401,Sheldon,"okay, i’m gonna let that slide because i know you’re hopped up on tea bags."
36176,Sheldon,i’d like to do the math.
45024,Sheldon,what? how should i know? excited? itchy? give me the first letter. 
36091,Sheldon,"so uh, kripke, i was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer."
41982,Sheldon,in a minute.
38726,Sheldon,are you trying to scare me? ‘cause you’re succeeding.
44611,Sheldon,cohabitation with my girlfriend? that’s a great deal to process.
37204,Sheldon,"oh, yes. i just discovered i don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a linux partition, so you and i are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
38483,Sheldon,you’re embarrassing yourself.
40536,Sheldon,"am i? the mind’s a mysterious thing, leonard. he could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn."
40965,Sheldon,"oh, five more minutes."
45283,Sheldon,"uh, wait, before we eat, i have a little welcome to the building gift for raj."
35045,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?"
40365,Sheldon,"yeah, only after i eliminated all the obvious answers. you’re welcome."
42795,Sheldon,"uh, well, it’s scary. and sometimes i get the pedals mixed up. but, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. i can’t take that away from you, so what do i do? oh, come on, i’m practically feeding you the answer. i compromise."
38493,Sheldon,why not? penny did it.
34357,Sheldon,"and snoring. and that’s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. it’s a throat doctor."
41756,Sheldon,would you like to talk about it?
45182,Sheldon,why?
44985,Sheldon,"i was not thinking it. although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable."
40573,Sheldon,"no, i don’t."
45596,Sheldon,i already do.
40247,Sheldon,"good. now, i assume we’re splitting the cheque?"
42000,Sheldon, mother?
35130,Sheldon,"it worked. it really worked. they said i was mad, but it worked.  "
45426,Sheldon,"oh, let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. i’ll go first. okay, here. uh, heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. and the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? and heisenberg says, darn it, now i don’t know where i am."
37140,Sheldon,"now, if ma equals mg what does that imply?"
40852,Sheldon,"brown rice, not white rice?"
45405,Sheldon,not to tell anyone.
41576,Sheldon,"oh, did i forget to tell you? that store went out of business years ago."
45094,Sheldon,then why didn’t you say that?
43766,Sheldon,"she was late. and she found atomic spectroscopy boring. well, i wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals."
38680,Sheldon,"i’d like a frozen yogurt, please."
44108,Sheldon,i stand corrected. fun.
39403,Sheldon,"what do i say? i say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. stop it."
41805,Sheldon,"don’t get soft on me, hofstadter. i will slap those glasses right off your face."
36672,Sheldon,"thanks, mom."
38404,Sheldon,"i don’t care for novelty editions of monopoly. i prefer the classics, regular and klingon."
34848,Sheldon,"hunger? indigestion, i’m sorry i’m really not very good at this. anyway, penny now believes that on friday night, we’re going to participate in my cousin leopold’s drug intervention. "
40634,Sheldon,"yeah, oh, i’m sorry. i should’ve mentioned this earlier. you’re not invited."
35061,Sheldon,"hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved russia, but on this physics bowl team i rule with an iron fist. . ow!"
36821,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i believe you’ve misunderstood. i’m not giving you the job. i’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview."
40075,Sheldon,"yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it."
35983,Sheldon,"mmm, great news, leonard, i’ve solved my penny gift dilemma."
45446,Sheldon,he’s not wrong. it was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.
35678,Sheldon,did you enjoy the humorous footnote where i illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the flash playing tennis with himself?
43305,Sheldon,check.
44653,Sheldon,although now i’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes.
35841,Sheldon,"look i’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. i’m out."
41336,Sheldon,"and i’m glad you and i are friends again, too."
43908,Sheldon,"oh. it was amazing. i, i saw it a few days later. what a movie."
41435,Sheldon,"oh, we’re fine. as howard advised, she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries."
43853,Sheldon,"in the past, you’ve come to me when i’m struggling with a dilemma."
45494,Sheldon,"oh, you have to say that, you’re sweet on me."
42221,Sheldon,"ah, very good. because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the holocaust."
36622,Sheldon,"oh, that’s clever. let me see if i understand this correctly. her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?"
34701,Sheldon,it’s been in every wallet i’ve owned since i was five. 
44988,Sheldon,"some will be successful, some may be homeless. it’s fun to think about."
43409,Sheldon,"boy, i’m glad we’re going out again."
36308,Sheldon,before taxes.
38979,Sheldon,"i’m familiar with everything, but go on."
34422,Sheldon,"put it on the back burner. anyway, it occurs to me, if i ever did perfect a time machine, i’d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place."
43895,Sheldon,oh. all right. um. i should probably tell you something about this gift.
35408,Sheldon,you mean like spock?
37214,Sheldon,"one of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in edwin abbott’s mathematical fantasy, flatland."
42667,Sheldon,come on.
40425,Sheldon,it is glorious. one of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. and i’m spanking him so hard his grad students won’t be able to sit down.
42194,Sheldon,"look at arthur, cracking up at a joke i told him. i’ll never hear that laugh again."
42720,Sheldon,"well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of fun with flags is at an end. if i could, i would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. and if you touched the ground, burn you. i’d like to take a moment to personally thank dr. amy farrah fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related internet info-tainment show."
34336,Sheldon,no.
42403,Sheldon,"he’s right. and given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, i’m sure you do suck."
41720,Sheldon,i would’ve preferred to have you there with me.
38335,Sheldon,more or less.
45144,Sheldon,i don’t want to go home.
38477,Sheldon,"no, although it’s a question i’ve been pondering since preschool."
44579,Sheldon,"i am cool. this is yoo-hoo, chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin."
36403,Sheldon,you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
44561,Sheldon,i never realized this building was classified.
35344,Sheldon,i don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.
41484,Sheldon,"well, you should be. my discovery is spreading like wildfire. unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean."
36717,Sheldon,"an appropriate cricket name. for example, jiminy."
36124,Sheldon,was that sarcasm?
44077,Sheldon,"meemaw, look, i’m sorry, but i have to defend my girlfriend to you."
37909,Sheldon,thank you for driving me.
44432,Sheldon,"i don’t understand. you were happy to do this when i hired you. why, why are you upset with me now?"
36742,Sheldon,"oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. all right. well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, i was forced to talk to penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my flash 123 to goeth to wolowitz."
35031,Sheldon,why? 
39434,Sheldon,"hmm.  all right, all right. i see what’s going on. a little pre-halloween hijinkery. a ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. the trifecta of haunted house clichés. instead of eek, i say yawn."
36896,Sheldon,your mee-maw died? that’s terrible.
44541,Sheldon,"don’t sign anything? that’s your advice? okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?"
41396,Sheldon,"yes. you were kind enough to watch raiders of the lost ark with me. so i’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, little house on the prairie."
44711,Sheldon,"we have people over all the time. we have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that ups driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging."
41609,Sheldon,hah!penny? next.
41088,Sheldon,"very mature. you’re lucky i’m out of silly string. as i was saying, leonard, you’ll never guess who i just found online. professor proton."
36014,Sheldon,"trust me, kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. observe. kripke! i would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met."
38293,Sheldon,"a little, but go on."
40745,Sheldon,all right.
42109,Sheldon,"oh, duchess, look at me. my quantum gravity’s positively loopy."
44728,Sheldon,"you know, exactly. we’ve never thrown a brunch before, and i wanted to work out all the kinks."
38618,Sheldon,"raj? what are you doing? i don’t think so. you’ve had your allotted six ounces. the first bathroom break isn’t until the denny’s located near bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. remember, people, we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder."
40168,Sheldon,"leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. i don’t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think i feel about theirs?"
38933,Sheldon,"well, now i just feel silly holding it."
39129,Sheldon,last one.
40771,Sheldon,why don’t you show me yours first.
39542,Sheldon,"nonsense. no. lovey-dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. no. lovey-dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which i’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. isn’t that right, ld?  no. where are you going? come back, lovey-dovey! this is your home now! i already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of amazon! he’s gone."
37856,Sheldon,be more specific.
40191,Sheldon,"no, i’m having a relationship problem with amy. and by the way, that book gave me nightmares."
39235,Sheldon,yes. i read recently about a fellow in kansas with an enormous ball of twine. i bet you could give him a run for his money.
41113,Sheldon,"what, well what’s wrong? is she upsetting you? because i can make her go away."
21845,Sheldon,i don’t like this spot. i have to keep turning my head.
38104,Sheldon,yes.
42198,Sheldon,"wow. uh, you’re dead, so i’m going to let that slide. obi-wan kenobi is a character from star wars. after his physical demise, he comes to luke skywalker as his mentor in spirit form."
36443,Sheldon,would you rather i offer my personal insight?
41691,Sheldon,yes. i’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. lucky duck.
44676,Sheldon,"oh, look who’s in favour of compromise, the woman who married leonard hofstadter."
38121,Sheldon,"leonard, you are my best friend. i’ve known you for seven years, and i can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to amy farrah fowler."
36486,Sheldon,eat? my dinner? in your apartment?
38063,Sheldon,coming!
36889,Sheldon,luminescence spell.
45803,Sheldon,would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
44255,Sheldon,"in here is every clock radio i’ve ever owned. calculators, vhs tapes. yeah. oh. sporting equipment."
42629,Sheldon,"i love you, too."
45154,Sheldon,"oh, get this. i get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. i get to learn things like hand signals. ooh. there’s forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes. are you done yet? you’re missing"
44895,Sheldon,"no. now that you know my weakness, i hate you more than ever."
36456,Sheldon,of course i am. removing joe chill as the killer of batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
44148,Sheldon,"when i was six, they told me batman was coming to my party. i waited by the door for hours. closest thing to batman i saw was when a robin flew into the window."
41512,Sheldon,"well, you should be. because all i can think about is how much i want to kiss you. and not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. like mommies and daddies do."
40291,Sheldon,"oh, i was having a little trouble sleeping and i just thought, uh, seeing as you’re up, we could talk."
38806,Sheldon,water. neat. with a little umbrella.
45138,Sheldon,"hey, uh, bernadette, let’s test this theory. what do you think i’m feeling right now?"
44977,Sheldon,wowza.
45531,Sheldon,"no, but you are, so i got you this as a present."
40726,Sheldon,"it’s a comic book convention. you know, it’s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one’s still pretty good."
35468,Sheldon,"no, no, no, it’s… oh for god’s sakes, gimme. "
42355,Sheldon,i can’t believe i have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what’s in their diapers.
39978,Sheldon,"fun time. hah. sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me."
35505,Sheldon,frenzy stance.
37499,Sheldon,you said we were invited.
35538,Sheldon,but i’m not.
38227,Sheldon,prescription or non-prescription strength.
40635,Sheldon,"amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves."
42234,Sheldon,"slick, huh?"
37391,Sheldon,sorry? i’ve been dreaming about going to the large hadron collider since i was nine years old.
42897,Sheldon,"oh, i did more than work out all the math. i wrote a paper."
34274,Sheldon,"oh, right, yes, i could have stayed behind and watched wolowitz try to hit on penny in russian, arabic and farsi. why can’t she get her own tv."
42249,Sheldon,i don’t know. i am really aggravated.
42970,Sheldon,"no, no. we designed an experiment involving you. see? now, isn’t that interesting?"
34639,Sheldon,"you laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support. "
45586,Sheldon,what is leonard doing calling you at this hour?
37322,Sheldon,i can’t see it! it just won’t coalesce.
41081,Sheldon,"amy, i must say, i was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening."
34326,Sheldon,"a little messy? the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. i’m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale. "
35362,Sheldon,penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for leonard. 
35769,Sheldon,"no one said anything of the kind to neil armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon."
44056,Sheldon,"if i did, would i find any?"
43826,Sheldon,"sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. and he does more things for you than i can even begin to list."
34832,Sheldon,why? 
41822,Sheldon,you don’t know that. i still have plenty of solid leads on this list.
38768,Sheldon,"well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, i stand at the ready."
37695,Sheldon,"certainly. it’s not like i have to moderate my food intake because i’m planning on eating again very shortly. mm, mm, mm!"
38592,Sheldon,real cocoa?
37966,Sheldon,"that’s an excellent idea. yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster."
43464,Sheldon,why not?
41625,Sheldon,"perhaps you’re right. i’m sorry for my behaviour. i’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate."
37616,Sheldon,"oh, yes. in fact, i’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. you bowl like your mama. unless, of course, she bowls well. in which case, you bowl nothing like her."
40617,Sheldon,"now you’re being a responsible patient. now, you may notice some tingling."
37933,Sheldon,this is an interesting topic. how many sexual encounters have you had?
38700,Sheldon,i’m sorry. i just don’t buy it.
35825,Sheldon,who would ask me?
39438,Sheldon,gentlemen. .
44253,Sheldon,"it’s basically everything i’ve ever owned. um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. just all of it."
43660,Sheldon,perfect. now we really are in a mexican standoff. is this one of those times where i’ve won the battle but lost the war?
34997,Sheldon,"and you also have a note from your mother that says i love you, bubbula. but neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes. "
39644,Sheldon,"well said, boy wonder."
35750,Sheldon,"well, then what took you so long?"
35539,Sheldon,"fine, what do you want me to do?"
36242,Sheldon,no.
44072,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
36281,Sheldon,nobody calls me moon pie but meemaw!
39143,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll go. just for the record, my aunt ruth died in a hospital. she went in to visit my uncle roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. the two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel."
37919,Sheldon,no.
41514,Sheldon,"hey, isn’t that professor proton?"
40404,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. the dishes themselves are in no way halloweenie."
43053,Sheldon,"oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on mars, and i applied to be among the first to go. what should we name him? you know, i came in thinking seth, but he kind of looks italian."
45442,Sheldon,who’s ready to laugh?
38216,Sheldon,"i know how to get the bucket! i can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. let’s see. go north. you are in a forest. go north. you are in a forest. go north. you are in a forest. oh dear, i believe i’m lost. well, i’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow."
38485,Sheldon,that’s very hurtful.
39758,Sheldon,"yeah, you know how it works. once a quarter, keep our readiness up. now, rise and shine, sleepy head. half the town is probably dead."
35132,Sheldon,"yeah, that’s the problem, it’s too big. "
41206,Sheldon,"back to the future ii was in the back to the future iii case, and back to the future iii was, get this, in the back to the future ii case."
37008,Sheldon,hello.
37511,Sheldon,"if you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by sauron in mount doom, i look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement."
43311,Sheldon,"yes, it’s a robot uprising. call the police."
35056,Sheldon,lamda equals one over pi r squared n 
39899,Sheldon,you sure i can’t get you that cup of tea?
42617,Sheldon,penny implied the same thing. is this true?
45245,Sheldon,he doesn’t really want penny to go to comic-con. he’s just doing it to make her happy.
40810,Sheldon,"that’s a good one. dumbledore dies in that one. yeah, i know, i didn’t see it coming, either."
44831,Sheldon,"yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise."
40024,Sheldon,"they had a make your own sundae bar. ooh, that was a night to remember. do you know, on the one trip, i just had a bowl of nuts."
35450,Sheldon,just when i think i’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.
34817,Sheldon,you just lied to penny.
43352,Sheldon,excuse me. starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. i’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.
36311,Sheldon,i have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. good luck.
35960,Sheldon,it is a big whoop. it made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless.
44631,Sheldon,okay. talk.
36526,Sheldon,"you told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. and once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown."
36371,Sheldon,i’m checking for musical instruments. does that sound like castanets to you?
41781,Sheldon,"well, have fun."
45223,Sheldon,"let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?"
36037,Sheldon,"i know, i may have started off with a fairly obvious one. you did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1. i’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest. it should take you no more than 3 hours."
44842,Sheldon,"very well. oops, how clumsy of me. you know what? let me get that. hey. where are you going? i, did you even look at my bottom?"
42406,Sheldon,"well, if you’re going to serve cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of cornwall or be prepared to learn it."
44940,Sheldon,this is the level you’re stooping to.
36891,Sheldon,three-headed lion.
36101,Sheldon,"oh, leonard, you know i can’t do that."
43749,Sheldon,"right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use."
43860,Sheldon,where are you going?
45155,Sheldon,"oh, hey. if you knocked, i couldn’t hear you. i’m welding this locomotive engine. and if you didn’t knock, how about some manners?"
35911,Sheldon,"what a beautiful job stephanie did. i might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. it’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity."
40391,Sheldon,"oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!"
38664,Sheldon,i suppose that’s one way to look at it.
34516,Sheldon,"semiotics. the study of signs and symbols, it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics."
43779,Sheldon,"no. um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?"
39026,Sheldon, penny?
44634,Sheldon,"this is such a relief. honestly, if it didn’t get you all worked up, i’d kiss you right now."
37466,Sheldon,please try to wear something appropriate. it won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
34835,Sheldon,"when we played chess earlier, you were terrific and i can’t wait to play you again. goodnight. "
37896,Sheldon,huh. it would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
42814,Sheldon,"before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?"
45684,Sheldon,i can hear it!
35282,Sheldon,"no, no, no, no, no, no. let me start again. in 1935, erwin schrodinger…"
36836,Sheldon,there is a fine line between wrong and visionary. unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
38136,Sheldon,thank you.
45124,Sheldon,fine. i’ll just give them the finger.
42856,Sheldon,ladies.
35977,Sheldon,that presupposes penny is tense.
35570,Sheldon,"my point is, if koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort."
42337,Sheldon,"here, day one, uh, this was the seat i was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. as it was first class, i suspect ritz. this is the train bathroom. this is the imodium i took so i would never have to use the train bathroom."
34220,Sheldon,great.
42045,Sheldon,thank you again for dinner.
42747,Sheldon,"yes. maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again."
34903,Sheldon,i need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down.
41545,Sheldon,"hello, leonard. oh, hello, arthur. what an odd coincidence that you’re both here."
44234,Sheldon,"i suppose i should set this up. or would you like to rob me of that, too?"
43988,Sheldon,can you believe they planned a trip to las vegas and didn’t invite me?
45822,Sheldon,"aw, nuts."
37571,Sheldon,"where exactly? sheldon square? sheldon towers? sheldon stadium, home of the fighting sheldons?"
39574,Sheldon,i came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
40881,Sheldon,"well, i hope it’s with a third good option, because these first two, buh."
43083,Sheldon,all i did was answer a few questions about the theory. and then expressed my gratitude that scientific american doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.
35584,Sheldon,"don’t talk to me like i’m a child. now, take me to return my star wars sheets!"
44490,Sheldon,i don’t like this at all.
44550,Sheldon,"yeah, we’ll do it in two. hi. i’m dr. sheldon cooper. i’m the actual brains behind this project. also, engineers aren’t real scientists, mit’s a trade school, and the death star is from star wars, not star trek. but otherwise, thank you for your service."
39488,Sheldon,how can i? you won’t stop talking about it.
39039,Sheldon,"no, you most certainly are not."
39586,Sheldon,"stuart, please. you’re being rude."
38392,Sheldon,you know what? i’m going back to i told you so. i told you so.
38999,Sheldon,perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
41365,Sheldon,"nice try. now, element lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. helium has an atomic number of two. if you multiply that by the atomic number of n, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? i’m just funnin’ you, silicon. and that is the most common element in the earth’s surface. so that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab."
38743,Sheldon,it was a compliment. i believe in giving credit where credit is due.
41479,Sheldon,"yeah, i know. they called it the greatest thing since the communist party. although i’m pretty sure that the communist party made them say that. i like china. see, they know how to keep people in line."
40470,Sheldon,"so, wil, what do you have for us first?"
36370,Sheldon,"oh, no, the new ones, they’re here."
39017,Sheldon,irrelevant. leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. he thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.
42834,Sheldon,"well, i suppose…"
40068,Sheldon,"leonard, penny, i just, i want you both to know that i regret my actions toward the two of you. that’s a lie."
36165,Sheldon,"it’s totally understandable. in bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location."
43743,Sheldon,"excuse me. no one does a better job pretending to be a person than i do. siri comes close, but i know more jokes."
37668,Sheldon,"you did this, didn’t you?"
39286,Sheldon,you don’t know the half of it. it was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. but it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying h-o starter sets.
34841,Sheldon,"of course i do. my watch is linked to the atomic clock in boulder, colorado. it’s accurate to one tenth of a second. but as i’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical."
43544,Sheldon,"just a few more signatures, and we’ll be finished. initial here to acknowledge that you’ve returned your key. okay. as my future neighbour, i’d like you to have a key. initial here to acknowledge you received it."
38929,Sheldon,i always prefer the train.
37977,Sheldon,"no, the flash shirt is because it’s friday, but it’s nice when things work out. where’s your heart rate monitor?"
42250,Sheldon,"i’m writing an appeal to the faculty senate, so that i can move on from string theory."
45719,Sheldon,"sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much, but okay."
40160,Sheldon,and the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. ba-da-bazinga!
45579,Sheldon,"do you know, i’ve corresponded with peter higgs. would you like to see some of his letters?"
36947,Sheldon,"roll the dice, leonard."
43605,Sheldon,"there’s that prostate doctor, but i’m still mad at her. oh, there’s a woman. i’ll make her my girlfriend."
42510,Sheldon,"oh, i’ll check amazon."
36291,Sheldon,it’s eleven am.
35213,Sheldon,"let’s say that i go out and i spend fifty dollars on you, it’s a laborious activity, because i have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. now i can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. and i ask you, is it worth it? "
37547,Sheldon,any group big enough to trample me to death. general rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
44038,Sheldon,"oh, i got a letter from my meemaw. umm. smell this."
21820,Sheldon,third barrier passed. you have won the right to see your room. huzzah!
35078,Sheldon,turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. it’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. in a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. they might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash. 
36549,Sheldon,"if you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be."
38788,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party."
44939,Sheldon,what do you think you’re doing?
38542,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, we’re doomed."
38333,Sheldon,ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.
39238,Sheldon,"well, there’s the difference. "
42506,Sheldon,"well, i wonder if anyone’s tried that."
42316,Sheldon,"oh, i have no idea. i never left the train station."
35137,Sheldon,"oh, alright, this is missy, missy this is leonard and rajesh and you’ve already met howard. "
43911,Sheldon,"i know how you feel. the best buy by my house is only the third best best buy. they have the best buys, but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a best buy the best best buy."
42340,Sheldon,"yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. you would wind up with an army so cute it couldn’t be attacked."
36560,Sheldon,it doesn’t say. it must be an emergency. everyone at the university knows i eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.
37533,Sheldon,waterfalls. crashing waves. babbling brooks.
36640,Sheldon,tell me what?
44717,Sheldon,"well, for our first time hosting, i thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. you know, like how i practiced for that halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station."
35074,Sheldon,william shatner.
35050,Sheldon,leslie winkle? 
35079,Sheldon,"i know, it’s basic culinary science. "
34291,Sheldon,"it’s okay. it wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last."
38263,Sheldon,"don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system."
37508,Sheldon,it appears to be a lord of the rings ring.
39092,Sheldon,i don’t want to hug you.
43940,Sheldon,i suppose it could end up on a collision course with earth and destroy life as we know it.
39933,Sheldon,"he’s not a barber, he’s the nephew. he’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. besides, mr. d’onofrio knows exactly how i like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in texas."
44192,Sheldon,"to be clear, leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the t-shirt and mugs. oh, now they own the mugs."
41008,Sheldon,pchew!
38314,Sheldon,no.
21826,Sheldon,"we might as well settle it now, it’s going to be on for years. initial here. all right, that’s television and movies. section nine, miscellany. the apartment’s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure."
43748,Sheldon,that’s it. the sheldon cooper girlfriend challenge is officially live.
39304,Sheldon,one moment. i’m conducting an experiment.
36916,Sheldon,"i grew up in texas. football is ubiquitous in texas. pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, european football, which most texans believe to be a commie plot."
37392,Sheldon,shame on you! that’s no dream for a scientist!
39539,Sheldon,"it’s remarkable. all that time spent in fear. and for what? he’s magnificent. oh, dear. i just realized i haven’t offered you a beverage."
37220,Sheldon,what if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
38013,Sheldon,i believe she’s experiencing her menses.
40321,Sheldon,"yeah, the point is higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps i’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my nobel prize."
34252,Sheldon,you’re lactose intolerant. 
45365,Sheldon,"the coefficient isn’t lambda, it’s lambda sub one. and over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. and lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?"
35916,Sheldon,"well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. i just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you."
38114,Sheldon,i’m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. just a little experiment in pest control.
34685,Sheldon,"tonight is halo night, it’s like talking to a wall. "
40867,Sheldon,do you want to catch up on some walking dead?
39622,Sheldon,"you clearly don’t. what my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity."
38402,Sheldon,"now you just being silly. wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer.  hello. yes, the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. of course you can. pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. that means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. be part of that proud tradition."
42986,Sheldon,"yeah, but we don’t have to debate this. we’re scientists. we can conduct our own research. i propose that we imprison two street people and…"
41798,Sheldon,"y, no. i’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and i think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. for example, where is this going? are you two ever getting married? and, if so, where will we all live? have you thought about that?"
36669,Sheldon,my credibility may have been damaged…
36208,Sheldon,did you notice the sign on his counter? he’s not a full-time dry cleaner. he also makes keys.
42140,Sheldon,oh. who knows?
45633,Sheldon,show me your mucus! your mucus! 
45739,Sheldon,"nice to meet you, professor proton. nice to meet you, professor proton. nice to meet you, professor proton. nice to meet you, prof… ow! leonard?"
39121,Sheldon,"yes, i’d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint."
36819,Sheldon,"i’m impressed, raj. those are very cogent and reasonable conditions."
41313,Sheldon,i’d like a ride. assuming you actually do take me to work.
35975,Sheldon,i don’t see anything in here a woman would want.
40416,Sheldon,it was a compromise. i lost.
35520,Sheldon,"but wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman."
40559,Sheldon,go ahead. that’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. it smells funny in here.
42749,Sheldon,"no, it’s not good enough. it has to be perfect."
42549,Sheldon,that’s preposterous. how would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?
37288,Sheldon,bad idea.
39888,Sheldon,i found him. he’s in the bathroom. president siebert?
38403,Sheldon,"are you sure you have enough comics? you’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. that’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing american comic book idioms like bamf and snikt."
39070,Sheldon,"it’s a laptop with a full charge. honestly, what do you see in him?"
37102,Sheldon,hello.
40250,Sheldon,copy that. over. 
37813,Sheldon,this is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
44914,Sheldon,what happened to them?
41298,Sheldon,"no, it’s you. all right, i hear whispering and giggling. now i think i hear kissing."
40918,Sheldon,"well, so much for your advice on complimenting penny."
44320,Sheldon,"well, we’re only watching game of thrones. a party sub implies it’s a party."
45085,Sheldon,doesn’t like games. that’s one.
41653,Sheldon,"yeah, but what about the chinese research team? they found it."
41874,Sheldon,"i may never stop thinking about it. amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?"
40056,Sheldon,"very well. cooper to enterprise, one to beam up. energise.  ah. tiny spock. help."
39208,Sheldon,"hey. leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?"
35392,Sheldon,well alright then.
40476,Sheldon,could you? that would solve everything. you are the best. i’ll see you at dinner tonight?
38190,Sheldon,"given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large indian car company, it’s actually extremely plausible."
42838,Sheldon,"very well. and good luck, i’m a pretty laid-back guy."
34692,Sheldon,my point.
44569,Sheldon,one o’clock? i’m not a raccoon.
35905,Sheldon,"when i fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. you see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. if the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love."
43982,Sheldon,i can consider a place america’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.
38040,Sheldon,i don’t follow.
44851,Sheldon,everything is stupid and i want to go home.
34374,Sheldon,i’ve got the sword of azeroth!
36224,Sheldon,that was for my cushion.
39590,Sheldon,"fine. amy, will you be my girlfriend?"
45311,Sheldon,"oh, the project is classified. i can’t tell you. oh, i suppose i could redact the classified parts. all right, um, i came up with an elegant solution to the  wow, i wonder what they’re redacting."
36227,Sheldon,"well, if we’re going to descend into anarchy "
35987,Sheldon,"ah, good, penny, you’re here to exchange gifts. you’ll be pleased to know i’m prepared for whatever you have to offer."
37357,Sheldon,"no, i wasn’t talking to leonard."
36290,Sheldon, penny.
44270,Sheldon,thanks.
42076,Sheldon,why would you do that? you’re a string theorist as well.
41709,Sheldon,"actually, much better."
35700,Sheldon,"please, please, i don’t have a lot of time. look, ramona finally dozed off, and i need you to help me get rid of her."
45712,Sheldon,she sounds weepy. i don’t like weepy. let’s go.
37814,Sheldon,"no, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. the roommate agreement screws you."
34836,Sheldon,….. 
43321,Sheldon,"oh, doctor hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again."
39326,Sheldon,"mm. tough decision. there’s no weaponry from lord of the rings, forged in a chinese sweatshop?"
35257,Sheldon,"i’d love to, but i don’t have tangerine chicken. "
43181,Sheldon,but why are you here?
35674,Sheldon,"that would be acceptable. on mondays, i eat thai food. mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from siam palace."
38569,Sheldon,i understand. and your loyalty is admirable. but what if i were to up the ante?
43332,Sheldon,"oh, true. but all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen."
43653,Sheldon,guess i’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas.
43898,Sheldon,"i see. is that all right? i’m sorry, but this is a litigious society. i’m gonna need verbal consent."
41886,Sheldon,"good. um, the conductor said if i come back to the engine room, he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing."
44073,Sheldon,no. they asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
37033,Sheldon,all righty.
34452,Sheldon,"look, you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars."
35469,Sheldon,"you’re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, penny."
35191,Sheldon,"my god! why don’t you just tell them i’m a toll taker at the golden gate bridge? rocket scientist, how humiliating. "
45610,Sheldon,you called my mother?
40785,Sheldon,see?
36709,Sheldon,one at a time.  what was that?
45621,Sheldon,"so, this is engineering, huh? "
44115,Sheldon,"oh, no."
44158,Sheldon,i am. oh. wait.
43425,Sheldon,i just wanted to let you know that you can remove amy from your nightly prayers. unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
39638,Sheldon,leonard.
41426,Sheldon,really?
41093,Sheldon,"well, i’m e-mailing him right now."
36022,Sheldon,"you’re right. monte’s gone. we’ll bury him in the morning. a simple ceremony. i’ll speak. leonard, you’ll play your cello."
41619,Sheldon,so was the man who owned the local liquor store. he cried and cried.
35540,Sheldon,dr gablehauser.
38147,Sheldon,"oh! good point, amy. yeah, building on your premise, leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the apple genius bar, what are you doing?"
38882,Sheldon,hello.
43280,Sheldon,it actually says at least?
39803,Sheldon,i’m making s’mores. i wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.
39260,Sheldon, penny.
45733,Sheldon,"me, too."
40497,Sheldon,sold.
34635,Sheldon,"okay, this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to  now come on!"
38385,Sheldon,"this is indiana jones, not star trek. there should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. and even at star trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up."
42341,Sheldon,the answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. moving on.
43817,Sheldon,"i feel like i know what song that is, but i can’t put my finger on it.  my country, ’tis of thee. no."
40753,Sheldon,"well, i say that’s the last time we ever go outside."
36730,Sheldon,"cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential."
35524,Sheldon,"excuse me. thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?"
36260,Sheldon,"oh, this is an unmitigated disaster."
38531,Sheldon,"then it hits her. how is she going to survive? i mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. and then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend howard."
40993,Sheldon,"it’s simple, really. it occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. the, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once."
38621,Sheldon,"red leader to red five, come in. red leader to red five, come in. howard, you promised."
40878,Sheldon,next.
35624,Sheldon,we have to stop at pottery barn.
35012,Sheldon,youngest till the cyborgs rise up! 
35139,Sheldon,how exactly would one measure a sense of humour? a humourmometer? 
35129,Sheldon,"little miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. if i were to go into that apartment right now, would i find beanie babies? are you not an accumulator of care bears and my little ponies? and who is that japanese feline i see frolicking on your shorts? hello,hello kitty! "
42709,Sheldon,and now it’s time for the speed round of flag or not a flag.
44776,Sheldon,why are you speaking english?
40141,Sheldon,what do you mean wrong?
45395,Sheldon,what does it say?
38653,Sheldon,for instance?
36905,Sheldon,"oh, that certainly would suck."
38539,Sheldon,"oh, of course you are. look at the organizational chart. you’re clearly listed as founder."
41561,Sheldon,"none of your business. but when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it."
45409,Sheldon,yummy. and warm on my back.
34184,Sheldon,"you’re in my spot. this may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration."
39266,Sheldon,thank you.
39747,Sheldon,"careful, it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s who con."
40001,Sheldon,"oh, come on. it’s just a simple favour. now, when’s the last time i asked you to do something for me?"
35048,Sheldon,"it’s on, bitch. "
34514,Sheldon,"i said i could follow it, i didn’t say i cared."
39402,Sheldon,what sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a nobel laureate?
43983,Sheldon,"oh, fine. then i’ll just hang out with wolowitz."
37253,Sheldon,"yes, general tso."
34577,Sheldon,this party is just going to suck. 
39440,Sheldon,"yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. you think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. well, you’ve forgotten one thing. i am also a son of the lone star state. i’m texas through and through. and we know how to settle scores down there. if you doubt me, ask mexico."
36888,Sheldon,underworld guardian. we skirmish to the death.
43503,Sheldon,"yeah, and talked about physics with them."
44284,Sheldon,oh. do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.
37494,Sheldon,"not finished. it is because of you that i now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that i missed out on having gelato with stan lee."
38330,Sheldon,"i have troubles, penny. i’ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep."
38087,Sheldon,yes.
41532,Sheldon,"no, go ahead, say it. i know what it is. i’ve heard it my whole life. the word’s annoying. go ahead, say it. say it. say i’m annoying."
40854,Sheldon,"yes. amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?"
42670,Sheldon,"amy, he’s my best friend, and if you don’t take me, i’m going there anyway."
42391,Sheldon,"now, where was i? let’s see. oh, yes. over here. you… what are you doing now?"
38020,Sheldon,"oh, i never identified with the rebel alliance. despite their tendency to build death stars, i’ve always been more of an empire man."
34607,Sheldon,yet another child left behind. 
35419,Sheldon,"leslie winkle, penny. she belittles my research."
40851,Sheldon,is it kung pao chicken?
44506,Sheldon,hello.
36524,Sheldon,"oh, clever! playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions."
37742,Sheldon,"well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon."
43732,Sheldon,"i realized something. when amy was in my life, i was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her."
39185,Sheldon,remarkable. i’m just realizing how much leonard’s been skating by all these years.
35425,Sheldon,you continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
36985,Sheldon,"considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked, don’t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?"
44419,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, who is mike drop?"
41030,Sheldon,"well, now that i think about it, that would be most helpful."
42236,Sheldon,"well, stick to your guns. there will be a lot of pressure."
44444,Sheldon,"it went well. yeah, i’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. uh, stuart, i relieve you of your line duties."
34210,Sheldon,are you still mad about the sperm bank?
43327,Sheldon,tell her about the uranium. tell her about the uranium.
38382,Sheldon,"well, if it isn’t wil wheaton, the jar jar binks of the star trek universe."
37641,Sheldon,when are you going to talk to him?
45507,Sheldon,"you know, i have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. it’s too bad i enjoy doing them so much. the air force did it again. they’re erasing our lives."
44447,Sheldon,what if every person in front of us let someone cut?
43998,Sheldon,"hey, if you didn’t know bruce willis was dead the whole time, that’s not on me. okay. here it comes. you tried to take care of me when i was sick, and i was mean to you. there’s no excuse for that. and i’m truly sorry."
34228,Sheldon,to what end?
38943,Sheldon,no.
42133,Sheldon,"oh, got it. we order a pizza."
38267,Sheldon,"well, excuse me. that was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy."
45181,Sheldon,"oh, i won’t. i only eat equilateral triangles. isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. you didn’t see that."
37165,Sheldon,"december 25, 1642, julian calendar, sir isaac newton is born. jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. his birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake."
42202,Sheldon,this is the swampland of dagobah. it’s where luke was trained in the ways of the jedi.
35237,Sheldon,"not now, penny, this poor man needs me.  you hold on, i’ll be right with you. what computer do you have, and please don’t say a white one?"
36437,Sheldon,"so, leonard, how are you enjoying anything can happen thursday?"
37031,Sheldon,ok.
38522,Sheldon,"i won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder."
43684,Sheldon,i don’t like being extorted like this. especially by him of all people.
36239,Sheldon,"socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue."
34301,Sheldon,"i don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable mack daddy."
38379,Sheldon,what did he say?
38607,Sheldon,"well, i must say, i am impressed."
41863,Sheldon,"uh, i do. uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the miller hook and platform?"
45551,Sheldon,how are you settling in?
45745,Sheldon,amy? amy? did you hear what i said?
45083,Sheldon,mm. you seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
45636,Sheldon,you must release me from my oath. 
34413,Sheldon,me?
42803,Sheldon,"yes. yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life."
34541,Sheldon,do you realise i may have to share a nobel prize with your booty call?
42760,Sheldon,"oh, really? well, how about now?  and you got me nothing. christmas is ruined. let’s never speak of it again. well, this was fun."
39738,Sheldon,cut. did you not see we are rolling?
45238,Sheldon,that’s probably my fault. she may have heard about my cool dumbledore costume.
37068,Sheldon,why are you such a stupid head? that is also rhetorical. i’m sorry you had to hear that.
37218,Sheldon,"tell her you’re a circle, flatland gals are all hot for circles."
43561,Sheldon,"in my present, it’s in the future. in your present, it’s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man i met in the home depot parking lot."
34258,Sheldon,no.
36013,Sheldon,"what you fail to realize is kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power."
37671,Sheldon,uh-oh.
35990,Sheldon,i possess the dna of leonard nimoy?!
45292,Sheldon,"honestly, i’ve been better. do you have time? leonard says you’re very busy these days."
43428,Sheldon,it’s over for me. i’m done with women. like when i swore off pop rocks. they both hurt you on purpose.
44803,Sheldon,"apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all."
35422,Sheldon,"no, that response is unacceptable to me."
35053,Sheldon,the velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
34881,Sheldon,don’t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
39721,Sheldon,"needy baby, greedy baby indeed."
43105,Sheldon,"well, i’d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position’s so forgettable."
38584,Sheldon,probably going to have to throw them away.
40554,Sheldon,"no, no, this is a slippery slope, leonard. it starts with a parking space, where does it end? it’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat."
35109,Sheldon,"same paradox. if you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. "
44781,Sheldon,it’s all right.
41463,Sheldon,"well, i cannot give this stuff away."
39043,Sheldon,what’s 16 times 14?
39333,Sheldon,killing you? i can’t breathe.
39512,Sheldon,"there’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. that is the hell that is going on. we have no worms or seeds here. shoo, shoo."
35042,Sheldon,no you didn’t.
39926,Sheldon,help! somebody help!
43215,Sheldon,mm-hmm.
41057,Sheldon,"oh, dear. penny, have you been recording shows on our dvr again?"
35716,Sheldon,"yes. she’s in the living room. go, i’ll wait here."
36089,Sheldon,"penny, penny, penny. everything you’re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. raj, you’re out. the good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. how could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is glutamine?"
40341,Sheldon,"it’s all right, alex. i’m not mad at you, i’m just disappointed."
39291,Sheldon,"better than james bond, because he’s tinier."
36812,Sheldon,"i assumed as much. but never fear. like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, i have returned to save the day. odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. anyway, i was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that i could benefit…"
42126,Sheldon,"leonard, i could use your assistance."
35957,Sheldon,superman doesn’t sweat on earth.
36983,Sheldon,i don’t follow.
45543,Sheldon,and you’ll text me when you arrive at the airport?
43609,Sheldon,"well, we gave it a shot. how about you?"
40186,Sheldon,spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
34984,Sheldon,"what exactly is it you do? i know you chatter on about it all the time, but i’ve never really paid attention."
34897,Sheldon,i’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures. 
43714,Sheldon,"oh, certainly. uh, when i was eight years old, billy sparks cornered me in the playground. i asked myself what would spock do? then i grabbed billy on his shoulder and performed my first vulcan nerve pinch."
35982,Sheldon,"here. now, are we friends? colleagues? lovers? are you my grandmother?"
39142,Sheldon,i would think he would know that.
43537,Sheldon,thank you for letting me come speak with you.
42011,Sheldon,but i’m a professional scientist.
45133,Sheldon,"oh. well, i thought we were going in order."
41284,Sheldon,that’s odd.
41046,Sheldon,"well, yes, of course, he wouldn’t like that at all. last night, i was feeling in need of sexual release when i happened to come across your mother."
45653,Sheldon,"hello. this is sheldon cooper. i’m leaving a message for barry kripke. barry, it was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. i saw that you purchased the chef’s salad. apparently, you did not know that the chef’s salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. nevertheless, i hope you enjoyed it. i’m following up on our pending friendship, and i look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. sheldon cooper."
36267,Sheldon,people don’t go in my room!
40673,Sheldon,two trains?
45396,Sheldon,where?
43515,Sheldon,leonard?
44022,Sheldon,all i know is after the fight i went to emily’s to smooth…
42921,Sheldon,he still hasn’t responded. what’s taking him so long?
37007,Sheldon,shall i come back at a better time?
44484,Sheldon,"yeah, i do. they’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal."
38451,Sheldon,"i hadn’t considered that. give me a moment. all right, i’ve considered it."
40835,Sheldon,um…
42175,Sheldon,what is it?
38770,Sheldon,"actually, he can. the hindu code of manu is very clear in these matters. if a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, raj. the code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. if true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is leonard."
43871,Sheldon,"well, as you know, i’ll be celebrating amy’s birthday with her, and i could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift."
45161,Sheldon,"well, good for you guys. look, i have a grease smudge on my hand, and i’m okay with it."
37446,Sheldon,"yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine."
36058,Sheldon,i assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
45561,Sheldon,"oh, thanks. dr. nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at cern. and she brought me this duty-free toblerone."
38041,Sheldon,"penny, i assure you, i’m fine. my relationship with amy was purely intellectual. there were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. the relationship simply outlived its utility, and i’m continuing on with my life as before."
40377,Sheldon,"that is true. i have a higher than normal body density. if i run too deep a bath, i drown."
39875,Sheldon,that is your opinion.
43849,Sheldon,"hey, thursday can’t get here soon enough. i’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while i eat enough star wars cereal to choke a wookiee."
37025,Sheldon,all right.
38704,Sheldon,"yes, but he’s going to a better place where he won’t get beat up. so much."
36550,Sheldon,"oh, an excellent idea! i could certainly use a break."
39001,Sheldon,"i asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot now."
37211,Sheldon,"well, that’s certainly amusing, but i have no interest."
41887,Sheldon,do you want to come with me?
37492,Sheldon,you had gelato with stan lee?
37298,Sheldon,why would you knock over a lamp?
40051,Sheldon,you’re the one who told me to play with it.
44361,Sheldon,"personally, i find the notion of external rewards demeaning. i pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery."
37403,Sheldon,you’re right. judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
35352,Sheldon,"i’m trying, i’m counting catwomen. she did make a fine mutant in the x-men movies though."
39184,Sheldon,what is this?
43009,Sheldon,i believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.
35559,Sheldon,fine. 
42451,Sheldon,"for starters, they shed and bite."
44866,Sheldon,fine. you can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
42843,Sheldon,"only do solid research? i come to you for help, and you insult me? i thought the least that you would do would be…"
44495,Sheldon,are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
43559,Sheldon,"no, just because i’m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn’t mean i’m delusional. and since it is 2003, i don’t know who you are, so please exit the premises before i call the police on my stylish new flip phone."
43326,Sheldon,"ooh, this is a good one."
39932,Sheldon,you’re not mr. d’onofrio. i get my hair cut by mr. d’onofrio. you believe this guy?
42056,Sheldon,"oh, it is. although."
41722,Sheldon,i did. 
41732,Sheldon,"oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher."
35840,Sheldon,i believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. the cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
36636,Sheldon,"oh, hi mom. no, i told you i’d call you when i got home, i’m not home yet.  alright, i’m home. the arctic expedition was a remarkable success, i’m all but certain there’s a nobel prize in my future. actually, i shouldn’t say that. i’m entirely certain. no, mother, i could not feel your church group praying for my safety. the fact that i’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc. no, i’m not sassing you in eskimo talk."
38534,Sheldon,"all right, i’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app."
42281,Sheldon,really? it’s soaking wet.
43162,Sheldon,there it is. it’s just a gate. on a road.
43861,Sheldon,i wanted to let you know i’ll be spending your birthday with you.
40842,Sheldon,yes.
44713,Sheldon,"oh, don’t be. you get your hopes up, i knock them down. that’s called teamwork."
44743,Sheldon,"hello, i’m dr. sheldon cooper."
38888,Sheldon,"why hast thou forsaken me, o deity whose existence i doubt?"
41638,Sheldon,but none of you know what this is like. being celebrated for something you wish you never did.
21861,Sheldon,you’re welcome. 
38430,Sheldon,"are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? i did that one summer. ah, youth."
34585,Sheldon,"well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “how wasted am i?” which is met with an approving chorus of “dude.”"
42677,Sheldon,"that’s a good idea. penny, did you and leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?"
40667,Sheldon,"my mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what i wanted for christmas. and i told you, my pop-pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. i missed him and i wanted him back."
35228,Sheldon,"instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me… wow, this is hard. they got me… a motorised dirt bike. "
42252,Sheldon,you’re right. i’ll take that out.
38342,Sheldon,"to drinking.  nope. oh, if only there were some way to force howard to accept my apology so i could escape this miasma of guilt."
44819,Sheldon,"no, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. you know those things bother me. it’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…"
37015,Sheldon,"well, assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, i would certainly think so."
38214,Sheldon,"well, what if i spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak."
44207,Sheldon,"no, i am not saying that, because i kept saying that this morning and leonard said stop saying that."
37536,Sheldon,"wait, just to clarify. when you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?"
42413,Sheldon,"no, it’s yucky, but informing people about the history of yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum."
34770,Sheldon,"penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that i’m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence. "
34513,Sheldon,you’re talking to one of the three men in the western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought. 
37877,Sheldon,no one ever does. that’s why it happens.
39386,Sheldon,i don’t know. lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
42983,Sheldon,"i didn’t care for her yelling. but now that i’m not going to hear it again, i’m sad."
35403,Sheldon,oh please. the only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
41095,Sheldon,"it’s happening. leonard, it’s happening. professor proton is coming to our house."
41807,Sheldon,"every year. i told you, wear a diaper."
35862,Sheldon,"well, stephanie, since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, i guess i’ll just have to pick it up. have you ever witnessed a violent crime?"
45437,Sheldon,"what’d you do, delete your photo?"
36006,Sheldon,we accept your challenge. name a time and place.
38108,Sheldon,yes.
39839,Sheldon,"it’s like i’m living in a dictatorship. you must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life."
35196,Sheldon,"it’s actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it. "
42532,Sheldon,very well.
42861,Sheldon,"thank you. oh, and technically, it’s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. hey, this is fun. we should do it sometime when you aren’t all pms’ing. bye."
41645,Sheldon,how could you not like getting attention for playing wesley crusher? you were wonderful. a know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. who couldn’t relate to that?
34383,Sheldon,the dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
38070,Sheldon,a physics point.
37594,Sheldon,go on.
43367,Sheldon,"no, and i’m confused. it’s been nearly 24 hours. amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now."
44258,Sheldon,"i’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time i think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and i get butterflies in my stomach. and then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…"
36850,Sheldon,i didn’t say that.
44887,Sheldon,"no, i went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain."
35913,Sheldon,watery?
40363,Sheldon,it’s an observational rebuttal of the lambda-cdm model of the universe.
39427,Sheldon,"no, we don’t. the one we have works great."
37473,Sheldon,and who performed that heroic act?
34208,Sheldon,let’s try just walking out.
40868,Sheldon,have you seen the one where lori dies?
39076,Sheldon,"ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle."
38683,Sheldon,all right. yes. i see a sign. it says camarillo state mental hospital.
36517,Sheldon,penny.
41159,Sheldon,i’ve never knocked on my own door before. that was a wild ride.
40874,Sheldon,"well, i guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. now, here is, let’s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, i think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. contribute to my work. ah, kids say the darnedest things."
44455,Sheldon,what about joss whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?
37893,Sheldon,i can’t date amy.
41852,Sheldon,"for starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table."
45496,Sheldon,you’re so cute. i’m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.
35305,Sheldon,do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? 
38807,Sheldon,"sadly, penny, this evening, i am the dark knight, roaming these mean streets alone. a windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl."
44328,Sheldon,"oh, fine. we don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to."
38846,Sheldon,are there beans in it?
34353,Sheldon,"do you want some cereal. i’m feeling so good today i’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. hello, honey puffs."
40686,Sheldon,"no, no, shilly-shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the mexican navy. anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, shilly-shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady."
38746,Sheldon,maybe this will overcome your reluctance. i went on the internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old mrs. latham to get your libido humming. check out those saddle shoes. rar!
34352,Sheldon,you have a sarcasm sign?
41421,Sheldon,"mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good."
35681,Sheldon,not in these pants.
44621,Sheldon,very well. i’m on board.
42151,Sheldon,not at all.
42308,Sheldon,"well, perhaps i can help. sherlock holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. now, have, have you tried doing that?"
35106,Sheldon,"leonard, it’s two in the morning. "
35266,Sheldon,"oh, i wish it were that simple. you see, i don’t spend much time here and so i’ve never really chosen a place to sit. "
36434,Sheldon,"yes, he won’t let go of my comic book."
44944,Sheldon,"that’s true, but had i done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of id."
43169,Sheldon,you’re blowing it. we want to meet george lucas and become his friends and play with him.
35660,Sheldon,homo novus doesn’t know.
42998,Sheldon,"ah, that’s just as well. as much as i’d love to meet euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and i cannot look at toes during dinner. oh, i know, the person i’d most like to have dinner with is myself."
36360,Sheldon,what?
41673,Sheldon,what’s that animal doing in our apartment?
39636,Sheldon,you know what would be nice?
41877,Sheldon,the conductor and i have the same pocket watch. 
35541,Sheldon,"well, you didn’t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 nq sub 17."
35302,Sheldon,"oh. well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a phd in french literature. "
44904,Sheldon,"what a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a nobel?"
44772,Sheldon,interesting. very interesting.
34754,Sheldon,you may want to put on slacks. 
38779,Sheldon,i’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
42645,Sheldon,"really leonard. insults? after i spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?"
34741,Sheldon,i could eat. 
43356,Sheldon,what happened?
45680,Sheldon,mine!
42046,Sheldon,good night.
39592,Sheldon,wow. is that the kind of nagging i can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? good thing i drew this up.
45695,Sheldon,"nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow…"
36099,Sheldon,"unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work."
45147,Sheldon,really?
43581,Sheldon,"oh, dear."
45668,Sheldon,wheaton! wheaton! wheaton!
41215,Sheldon,"no, wait. perhaps i should sleep here so you don’t miss leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it."
38634,Sheldon, raj? i need to sleep here tonight.
36123,Sheldon,was that sarcasm?
40937,Sheldon,i got the b word.
34545,Sheldon,leonard?
45716,Sheldon,"oh, that’ll be kripke."
40717,Sheldon,but i came to file a complaint. somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.
38302,Sheldon,"well, your expectations have been subverted. aha."
37728,Sheldon,"yes, there are."
39618,Sheldon,"oh, good lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear leonard apart like this?"
43859,Sheldon,you’re right.
40537,Sheldon,i thought you left a long time ago.
35049,Sheldon,"actually, i don’t need a team, i could easily defeat you single-handedly. but the rules require four, so may i introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. and what about your team? what rat have you recruited to the ss sinking ship?"
38848,Sheldon,"yes, please. your girlfriend’s a little short-tempered."
37688,Sheldon,i was talking with penny.
36257,Sheldon,you don’t understand. my flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of m-theory effects in the early universe that i was going to give to george smoot at the conference.
40980,Sheldon,"well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. you know. that doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and i’m a trash can full of sweets."
43839,Sheldon,"i don’t care. amy, there was a song i couldn’t get out of my head. eventually, i realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, i can’t get you out of my heart. so, what i’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. the metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind."
44400,Sheldon,the hell prawn lunges out of the hot spring. you block it with your shield. do you attack?
38099,Sheldon,brobdingnagian.
34542,Sheldon,she’s not that intelligent.
44467,Sheldon,seriously? he invented the rubik’s cube.
36385,Sheldon,you don’t jog.
44132,Sheldon,"all right. look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the magnus force issue should be negligible."
37861,Sheldon,"please. even assuming you could answer any question the way i would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum."
34366,Sheldon,considering what? how great this place looks?
34856,Sheldon,"we just leave the house on friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab."
45153,Sheldon,"oh, oh. and guess where we get to sleep? our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. now, the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose. on the first day, i get to drive a steam engine. oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. oh, and if i volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they’ll let me stay as long as i want. so you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives."
44176,Sheldon,"thank you, bernadette. that was perfect."
35569,Sheldon,"irrelevant. see, i was studying recombinant dna technology and i was confident i could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them."
41232,Sheldon,"well, if you’d like, we could call him. i mean that you could call him. as i’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. as rock and roll bad boy paul simon once said, i am a rock, i am an i-i-i-island."
39190,Sheldon,"no. origami napkin swans, that’s the headline."
40294,Sheldon,"yeah. did you know that while leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today’s north korea, he’s downright average. hey, talk about a keeper."
45143,Sheldon,"fine. candy bars. now, do you enjoy a fun size? i know you do."
37807,Sheldon,"not penny, me!"
21842,Sheldon,"i assure you, you’ll be sorry you wasted your money on an ipod when microsoft comes out with theirs."
44599,Sheldon,"leonard, can i ask you a question?"
36497,Sheldon,"i’m curious about the whole social construct. on its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. what i’ve observed, however, is howard wolowitz crying like a little girl."
36755,Sheldon,i see. did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
42460,Sheldon,"yes, but as a store owner, i’ll finally have a good comeback to, you don’t work here, shut up."
35264,Sheldon,"ach, why not? we’re already through the looking glass anyway. "
38790,Sheldon,"well, no, sir, and do you know why? in a word, tradition. every thursday night for the last eight years, you and i and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. but i guess our rich heritage means nothing to you."
41637,Sheldon,"look, you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. you’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it."
34913,Sheldon,"no. not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green. "
34391,Sheldon,"oh, good lord."
42804,Sheldon,i’m not upset. i’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
40461,Sheldon,"professor hawking, how nice of you to call."
43968,Sheldon,she’s a dermatologist.
43274,Sheldon,aren’t you afraid of being blinded?
35160,Sheldon,why?
44151,Sheldon,"uh, mylar balloons, yes. latex balloons, no. water balloons, i will jump off the roof and aim for your car."
45743,Sheldon,"penny, it’s your lucky day. three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. grab your keys."
39956,Sheldon,"leonard, explain it to her."
44888,Sheldon,i’m so disappointed in myself. jealousy is completely illogical.
39917,Sheldon,"aha! good question. it turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. no. it’s next door, in professor davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause."
42682,Sheldon,it was like a grapefruit.
44216,Sheldon,what? i didn’t sign it yet.
34612,Sheldon,"let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation i will be less than useless. "
39417,Sheldon,"oh, yes, the common cold. just like everyone else. you’d love that, wouldn’t you?"
42886,Sheldon,"oh, i’m feeling much better. and i’ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels."
35854,Sheldon,"you say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth."
45360,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i’ve got amy up and running. shall we get to work?"
42429,Sheldon,"it’s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers."
44028,Sheldon,"my plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet."
43931,Sheldon,"but, look, an optical transient."
38350,Sheldon,"howard, you’re feeling better about me today, aren’t you?"
36196,Sheldon,what difference does it make?
42132,Sheldon,"hmm, what can we do that’s fun?"
41639,Sheldon,"here comes the embarrassment express. with stops at fraudville, wonder blunderberg, and kansas city. because it’s a hub."
38548,Sheldon,how about this for the app name? the surprisingly helpful equation-linked differential optimized numerator.
40674,Sheldon,i’m getting three trains.
37716,Sheldon,"oh, i believe that was something else i wasn’t supposed to mention."
21829,Sheldon, leonard?
43810,Sheldon,oh. i thought we were just friends.
36178,Sheldon,"normally, i’d feel the same way. but based on everything i’ve observed about us, i can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together."
36662,Sheldon,are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a nobel prize?
36529,Sheldon,"well, i have and it will knock your socks off! good luck getting them back on."
34673,Sheldon,"no, if we fill up on dumplings we’ll need to eliminate another entree. "
44344,Sheldon,no. i don’t believe you. i could tell.
44838,Sheldon,clearly the combination of our dna is exceptional. our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. we’ll be able to get into any preschool we want!
37371,Sheldon,"oh, heavens, no. since i don’t need to be paid, i didn’t need to be hired. i simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. let me get that plate out of your way."
38800,Sheldon,"oh, indians making tex-mex. might as well have had the chinese pizza."
40797,Sheldon,that’s awfully personal.
44463,Sheldon,"no, i can’t. this isn’t right."
39701,Sheldon,"it’s called non-fiction for a reason, leonard."
42652,Sheldon,"leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves?"
42687,Sheldon,"a little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. oh, i don’t care for this at all. oh, i need to see he’s okay."
39396,Sheldon,"careful, you’re using too much downey. you know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy."
41177,Sheldon,would you like to hear a classic sheldon cooper factoid?
35656,Sheldon,"well, those are indicators that i’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human."
34606,Sheldon,"given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the american education system. "
43268,Sheldon,"yeah, and if he does ask you, go. it’s amazing."
44248,Sheldon,right.
42681,Sheldon,there was a large plant in the lobby. it kept looking like the outside.
34934,Sheldon,"well, once. when i was fifteen, and spending the summer at the heidelberg institute in germany."
36734,Sheldon,"penny, i’d rather not talk about it."
45504,Sheldon,where did you move it?
35339,Sheldon,"i can’t believe i didn’t bring my gieger counter. you know, i had it on my bed and i didn’t pack it. "
39308,Sheldon,that’s the great thing. it doesn’t matter. my mind is freed up to think about more important things.
37987,Sheldon,i think so.
34926,Sheldon,"well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons."
44559,Sheldon,why would you do that?
39772,Sheldon,"think carefully here. clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall.  ‘sup?"
45491,Sheldon,"it’s okay, i stopped being upset about that. and no, the irony is not lost on me."
45387,Sheldon,"my pants are missing, i don’t remember anything. penny, this is your youth. what do i do?"
40297,Sheldon,homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or ph.
37540,Sheldon,"it amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. for example, why wasn’t william shatner in the new star trek movie?"
21846,Sheldon,we don’t watch babylon 5 in this apartment.
39960,Sheldon,i don’t know. i could do anything. all bets are off. the world is my oyster. i got it. i’m going to put on my tuesday pyjamas tonight.
43690,Sheldon,"absolutely not. yeah, penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. any words of advice?"
34605,Sheldon,"face to face? are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?"
34852,Sheldon,"well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. while you were sleeping i was weaving an un-unravelable web. "
45359,Sheldon,"soon. see, i could’ve said in the near future, but i didn’t say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. in, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. see, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already."
45623,Sheldon,welcome dennis kim. 
38017,Sheldon,they can’t function without me. i’m the social glue that holds this little group together. you’re welcome.
41115,Sheldon,"mr. jeffries, i need to show you something. :14:11,446"
45288,Sheldon,can you believe this guy?
39862,Sheldon,"you think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? they could do the same thing at any quiznos. and they’d offer to toast it for me, too."
40999,Sheldon,don’t.
41038,Sheldon,so am i. his passing makes me feel bad.
37583,Sheldon,hmm. . this is pretty sharp.
39338,Sheldon,i’m not surprised.
40964,Sheldon,"yeah, and some thanks i got. the assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami."
35993,Sheldon,"i know! it’s not enough, is it? here."
39455,Sheldon,"well, if it’s of any help, i’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including dr. seuss."
43339,Sheldon,"well, now i have to correct you. as a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. so i believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler."
38992,Sheldon,this is moving faster than we thought.
45002,Sheldon,welcome to texas.
45151,Sheldon,"oh, no. it’s not just me. no. the railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me."
39925,Sheldon,"what, and let him win? do i look crazy to you? we’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  and you, the notes are c, d, e, g and a. you pick one or i am chopping down that tree!"
43129,Sheldon,"leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way i did."
35359,Sheldon,"mom smokes in the car. jesus is okay with it, but we can’t tell dad. "
34709,Sheldon,"romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well."
39107,Sheldon,"rajesh, i’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. my recommendation is that you gobble these up like tic tacs."
37783,Sheldon,from the mind that brought you hi-lo. let me show you to your room.
21796,Sheldon,yes?
35058,Sheldon,"hang on, hang on a second, that’s not our answer. what are you doing?"
39241,Sheldon,"if we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles."
37500,Sheldon,"well, i’m not much of a sports fan, but thank you."
39749,Sheldon,how about constantly talks with food in her mouth?
44065,Sheldon,"but why? other than you two fighting, we’re having such a good time."
42860,Sheldon,"you talk about if werewolves can swim? see, leonard says yes, but i say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. what do you think?"
39343,Sheldon,"it’s not that simple, leonard."
41988,Sheldon,"yes, but now that i’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. boy, i can’t wait to see the look on her face. we’re leaving right now."
43599,Sheldon,"if you intend to pursue amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it."
44228,Sheldon,how could you do that?
40219,Sheldon,"fine, i’ll do it in english, but it loses something. the need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. maybe because i’m so interesting all by myself. with that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as i find on my own. the klingon would have made you cry."
44091,Sheldon,"so from now on, this program will be officially known as dr. sheldon cooper and dr. amy farrah fowler present dr. sheldon’ cooper’s fun with flags."
36774,Sheldon,really?
42898,Sheldon,i wrote a paper on our idea.
42298,Sheldon,"excuse me. is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants? oh, well, no, you’re understandably terrified. but, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, i embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. uh, sir, may i use your phone?"
39963,Sheldon,leonard sleeps while i play bongos.
40440,Sheldon,how would i know? i’m not listening to you.
38545,Sheldon,"in that case, may i offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?"
40286,Sheldon,never mind. i still can’t tell you.
36435,Sheldon,"leonard, we need a ruling."
36154,Sheldon,"yes, yes. yeah, i’m definitely going with colonoscopy."
37506,Sheldon,"no, what’s sad is that you don’t know adam west was tv’s batman."
42043,Sheldon,xbox.
36397,Sheldon,"you think i can’t hear them? listen to that. stomp, stomp, stomp. that’s wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one."
38952,Sheldon,"really, amy? gossip? i’m disappointed in you."
42050,Sheldon,penny?
38115,Sheldon,"well, we’ll just see how long you can hold out."
39072,Sheldon,two.
40230,Sheldon,"oh, leonard. let’s not take a saw to the branch we’re sitting on, shall we?"
43068,Sheldon,"afterwards, leonard blew his nose, and pie came out."
42331,Sheldon,"that’s a good point. you know, i’m a lot like gandalf the grey. he fought the balrog and emerged stronger than ever as gandalf the white. i was robbed of my phone and pants, and i, too, came back stronger. and whiter, too, ’cause i wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks."
37874,Sheldon,may i buy you a beverage?
36368,Sheldon,"you’re tricking me. you tell me the truth, what do we get?"
40119,Sheldon,"au contraire. when i correct people i am raising them up. you should know, i do it for you more than anyone."
41474,Sheldon,"leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius."
35335,Sheldon,"don’t be ridiculous, you love trains. "
36996,Sheldon,don’t flatter yourself. i’m just ignoring you.
44093,Sheldon,"it’s also my gift to you. that was clear, right? ‘cause you’re not getting anything else."
34815,Sheldon,i think i know.
37152,Sheldon,"that’s no reason to cry. one cries because one is sad. for example, i cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad."
37606,Sheldon,"question one, where are my pants?"
37553,Sheldon,don’t trample me.
40515,Sheldon,"you’re asking a lot of questions, wil wheaton. as a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? never mind, i’ll choose.  you were so good in stand by me."
39078,Sheldon,i suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.
38527,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, shush."
40540,Sheldon,"you don’t need to know, you don’t deserve to know, and you will never know."
43608,Sheldon,it’s a pokémon reference.
37684,Sheldon,"that’s the sauce my mother uses. she likes cooking italian because according to her, that’s what the romans made jesus eat."
37351,Sheldon,einstein.
36183,Sheldon,and i told you i wanted to see a doctor’s note.
37934,Sheldon,i should think so.
40012,Sheldon,those women are prostitutes? you said they were raising money for stem cell research.
44560,Sheldon,"see, that’s exactly what happened to me, except that i said it on purpose, and i have no regrets."
42138,Sheldon,"well, she talks a lot. she always wants to hold hands."
43359,Sheldon,yes.
44297,Sheldon,"eh, most of the jenga pieces are missing and the scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on."
43202,Sheldon,"i was afraid you might bring this up, so i have a work-around. there you go. as far as you’re concerned, i’m smiling. although, i must admit, i’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant."
38852,Sheldon,is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?
38066,Sheldon,"all right, but you’re not fooling me. whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen."
40646,Sheldon,"wait, svaty vaclav was the duke of bohemia."
44208,Sheldon,"oh, please. any contract i sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics."
44098,Sheldon,"please, all comments and questions should be flag-related."
43246,Sheldon,"so, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, i prefer the more accurate cow exploder."
36735,Sheldon,why would that make me feel better?
39433,Sheldon,"and reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative i comma zero, and there we have it. conclusive proof that i am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock."
41708,Sheldon,"penny, for the thousandth time, i’m saving myself for someone special. perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud. "
41569,Sheldon,i believe you.
39345,Sheldon,"of course. now get it yourself, you traitor."
35738,Sheldon,"all right, boggle warriors, kapla’!"
34287,Sheldon,tell him about our iq.
37246,Sheldon,"you know, i had never considered that. wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. well, it’s late."
43226,Sheldon,"oh, come on. i really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in."
35113,Sheldon,oh! i don’t usually pick up on those things. good for me. 
34901,Sheldon,"when i’m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance. "
38340,Sheldon,"i wronged howard, and he won’t accept my apology."
38388,Sheldon,"i believe in knowing my enemy, leonard. had twitter existed at the time, would not general custer have followed the tweets of sitting bull? would not lee have followed grant? would not spy have followed spy? i have more examples, but excuse me.  hello. well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. test phrases? all right. imatote. ulbu. twad. all together? i’m a total buttwad. why are you laughing? hello?"
41000,Sheldon,"you know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing i read in the closet. bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages."
45001,Sheldon,"given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?"
43138,Sheldon,"okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the uc berkeley physics department? i’ll have fries with that. because his education hasn’t prepared him for a career in the sciences."
35254,Sheldon,"howard, i’m going to need another mandarin lesson. i obviously didn’t make my point with those people. "
38268,Sheldon,for science.
35516,Sheldon,"tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he’s going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex."
42385,Sheldon,good. and how it relates to the calculus of variations?
40791,Sheldon,so?
35882,Sheldon,give me one good reason why not.
40884,Sheldon,it’s too late. i call dibs.
35925,Sheldon,"it’s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot."
34540,Sheldon,"boy, you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse. "
38235,Sheldon,perhaps. but they might ask me something else.
43706,Sheldon,"all right then. see? just my valuables. my passport, uh, my will."
43003,Sheldon,you didn’t mention leonard.
35839,Sheldon,"i don’t make the rules, leonard."
43199,Sheldon,"i don’t know the future. do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the earth, destroying feynman’s house and everyone in it?"
35930,Sheldon,"i beg to disagree. “a girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote leonard when she has stayed over for a, ten consecutive nights or b, more than nine nights in three week period or c: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights."
43069,Sheldon,why? i really don’t understand what’s happening here.
44359,Sheldon,"if batman were bitten by a radioactive man-bat, and then fought crime disguised as man-bat, would he be man-bat-man-bat-man or simply man-bat-man-bat-batman?"
40707,Sheldon,hello.
43742,Sheldon,"are you sure? i’ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person."
42955,Sheldon,"okay, now you’re getting creative."
36161,Sheldon,i envy you your childhood.
45367,Sheldon,brb. that’s short for be right back. i’m saving so much time.
36616,Sheldon,but meemaw just made cookies.
44643,Sheldon,i guess the experiment begins.
36990,Sheldon,and she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped.
42100,Sheldon,don’t feel bad. neither does he.
41118,Sheldon,"but, um, i did have you. and every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on channel 68, and we’d do science together. if it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? you know? instead of a world-class physicist, i could’ve wound up as a hobo. or a surgeon."
34963,Sheldon,i sense a disturbance in the force. 
36495,Sheldon,"no, leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered."
41950,Sheldon,really? i was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
35507,Sheldon,these are market research questions. i’m filling out the online registration for your game.
35582,Sheldon,i can’t take the bus any more. they don’t have seatbelts. and they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
41252,Sheldon,"but i don’t want to know how many underpants you own. although, based on the floor of your bedroom, i’d say it’s a thousand."
45121,Sheldon,"hey, i shared my honey nut cheerios with you."
38123,Sheldon,may i suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
44863,Sheldon,"i hope you’re happy making me read this. bert’s work is remarkable, and i’m more upset than ever. this is worse than when i had to admit that cedric the entertainer’s actually entertaining."
34806,Sheldon,yes. i’m sorry i tried to blow up your head. it was uncalled for. 
44417,Sheldon,"see, i remembered because if it looks like kim it’s kim, if it looks kind of like kim it’s kourtney, and if it looks nothing like kim it’s khloe."
41795,Sheldon,"well, to be honest, i thought she said yoda."
41983,Sheldon,thank you for my bobble head.
39278,Sheldon,"i’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating."
44060,Sheldon,"here you go, meemaw. i made it just how you like, a lot in a glass."
45255,Sheldon,hold on. is it back pay or is it a gift?
39053,Sheldon,"priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me."
41179,Sheldon,"well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting."
36741,Sheldon,hello.
42520,Sheldon,"oh, yeah, i’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field."
35407,Sheldon,i don’t care. there are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
40054,Sheldon,i thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.
35142,Sheldon,"they call me a genius because i’m a genius. tell mom that i currently weigh 165 pounds, and that i’m having regular bowel movements. enjoy the wedding, goodbye."
34524,Sheldon,"well, there’s leonard.  and he’s either with lesley winkle or a 1930’s gangster. "
36972,Sheldon,i want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
40474,Sheldon,i’ll be right back. feel free to play with yourself.
41447,Sheldon,"couple things, actually. your tone of voice, your body language…"
39977,Sheldon,"hmm, well, it’s a little hollywood. but i think i can pull it off. well done, penny."
37471,Sheldon,"well, of course you have a choice. although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. now, sit down. i call your attention to the events of november 16. do you remember that date?"
36866,Sheldon,that would probably save us some time.
41854,Sheldon,what if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
42159,Sheldon,your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.
42870,Sheldon,"that nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. but if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that’d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah."
44644,Sheldon,which side of the bed would you prefer?
42807,Sheldon,that’s exactly what i told him.
43663,Sheldon,"and i’m sorry i lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. although i am currently single, if you know anybody."
34285,Sheldon,"good thinking, i’ll just be the muscle."
44406,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. and any time you need a break from being bernadette the pregnant, bernatrix the warrior queen is here waiting."
42067,Sheldon,"on the one hand, the xbox one has a better camera, but the ps4 has a removable hard drive. thoughts?"
41119,Sheldon,"yeah, it’s true. a generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders."
39459,Sheldon,"on your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?"
42141,Sheldon,"so, we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?"
40737,Sheldon,mr. data’s weapon is his mind. i’m wielding it.
39030,Sheldon,"really, amy? tobacco and alcohol? need i remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?"
37587,Sheldon,"that’s how you start a psychotherapy session? how am i doing? i was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. instead, i get the same question i hear from the lady who slices my bologna at ralph’s."
40708,Sheldon,thank you.
38078,Sheldon,"yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and the phantom menace would be a timeless classic."
41340,Sheldon,"i don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing."
37712,Sheldon, here. i had to trade the others for my life.
45065,Sheldon,"you want to play jenga? or, uh, ticket to ride? hearthstone? what would you be the happiest losing at?"
43422,Sheldon,"amy, i don’t understand, are we broken up or not? it’s like you can’t make up your mind."
37146,Sheldon,greece.
37238,Sheldon,the dog… koira. the roof… katto. grapes… ryp leet.  one minute. sis  n.
34982,Sheldon,"but, since the arrival of dennis kim has rendered my research pointless, i just have to find something else to focus on."
44117,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord, penny’s pregnant, too?"
37330,Sheldon,don’t be ridiculous. what would i do with corn?
44742,Sheldon,"oh, calm down. i already put away five of these. you see? no muss, no fuss, not a single cuss."
41393,Sheldon,yes. why?
38193,Sheldon,"i always tell people, if you have only one day in los angeles, make it a train day."
37477,Sheldon,"good morning, your honour. dr. sheldon cooper appearing in pro se. that is to say, representing himself."
43092,Sheldon,"for the record, that kid was a terrible choice. if you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule england."
21833,Sheldon,12 hours? 
44525,Sheldon,yes ma’am.
38071,Sheldon,"amy, after consideration, i believe we may have acted rashly. i propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences."
35488,Sheldon,"well, yes, but you’re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. if you’d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening."
39985,Sheldon,"yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. that’s for babies."
44442,Sheldon,"oh, thanks, you’re a peach. beverly, we’ll catch up soon. bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, penny, you have spinach in your teeth."
45302,Sheldon,"yes, you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. it used to be me. now it’s raj and his attack tribble. anyway, i’m sorry for everything. oh, and fyi, if you cry while they’re fighting, they’ll take you to mcdonald’s."
45708,Sheldon,"well, you can add jerry’s junction to the list of train stores sheldon cooper will never set foot in again."
42374,Sheldon,"amy, please. i am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine."
34235,Sheldon,"if by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at mit, sure."
40729,Sheldon,"ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. i’d put on my listening ears if i were you."
34204,Sheldon,"i know, and i do yearn for faster downloads, but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve."
44458,Sheldon,"well, what a sad state of affairs. that you’ve all been so ground down by life, you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you."
35892,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i have a question about dating and relationships."
35713,Sheldon,i’m invoking the skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
40752,Sheldon,"yeah, well, we’re not. we’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. and to tell you the truth, i’m starting to feel like one. i want to go home now."
44470,Sheldon,"you know, that doesn’t work for me, let’s stay with mrs. cooper."
39675,Sheldon,"well, that approach has sheldon cooper written all over it."
34432,Sheldon,a more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
40533,Sheldon,"i’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes i like. you’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes."
44820,Sheldon,thank you. now yell charge and we can get out of here.
39703,Sheldon,"and now that i have some wood, i’m going to begin the erection of my settlement."
35866,Sheldon,"i spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. when i was 12, i got to ride there in a helicopter."
45505,Sheldon,"wait, so you’re just going to take all the work we’ve done for the last year and toss us aside?"
39367,Sheldon,what i’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. this is quite lovely.
41156,Sheldon,another quest by wolowitz? count me in.
36635,Sheldon,"i don’t know what arctic expedition you guys were on, but i thought it was a hoot and a half."
34983,Sheldon,"so i’ve decided, i’m going to collaborate with you."
40516,Sheldon,"hello, i’m dr. sheldon cooper. welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, star trek. and to help us, i’m pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, mr. levar burton."
36184,Sheldon,"all right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. did you see the episode of stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on earth’s athens and sparta? not important. leonard, raj and i are going to burst out the door and run away, howard will cover us."
44505,Sheldon,"all right, so less or equally awkward, got it."
44572,Sheldon,fine.  i don’t think i can go much longer.
44043,Sheldon,that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her. that’s not her.
39649,Sheldon,this is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? by lying to them?
41978,Sheldon,i’m sorry for every mean thing i ever did or said to you.
45572,Sheldon,we just went swimming.
38197,Sheldon,abundantly.
41269,Sheldon,"oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. anyhoo, leonard will be back in a couple days and i need a welcome home gift for him. as he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate."
39860,Sheldon,i’m sorry. it takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
38368,Sheldon,but how were our seats?
40402,Sheldon,fine. how about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? hewlett and packard. dibs on hewlett. what? you want to be hewlett?
36653,Sheldon,wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. do you have anything to say for yourself?
38866,Sheldon, is this your card?
35409,Sheldon,fascinating.
45676,Sheldon,i’d be much further along if i’d been allowed to practice.
45666,Sheldon,freaky?
34244,Sheldon,fine. 
40942,Sheldon,"howard’s disturbing recollections aside, i don’t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work."
40547,Sheldon,"well, i’m not using my nipples, either. maybe they should reassign those."
35670,Sheldon,i don’t drink coffee.
45341,Sheldon,"no, i can still hear it. oh, wait, that’s me. never mind, it’s fine."
35744,Sheldon,individual relish packets?
37943,Sheldon,the humorous implication being that i am wile e. coyote?
34905,Sheldon,it’s right here on the bottom. 
38026,Sheldon,greetings.
35043,Sheldon,"okay, i don’t know where you just came from, but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because i’m on the team and i wasn’t there, ergo the team did not meet. "
42199,Sheldon,you must be here to give me advice.
43285,Sheldon,"oh. very well. re-initiating calibration sequence. one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. it’s a good thing i didn’t send that letter."
41819,Sheldon,"you know, there was a time when comic-con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. and you mark my words, i’m gonna rip that guy off."
43007,Sheldon,"if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?"
42105,Sheldon,"let me put this in a way you’ll understand, penny. you remember how you explained to me that the kardashians aren’t real celebrities? well, geology is the kardashians of science."
38708,Sheldon,"well i’m sorry. it’s not my fault. i’m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. oh, now, don’t you start crying. you get in that spaceship. mommy’s late for indian bingo."
45192,Sheldon,you want me to look at him and listen to him?
39872,Sheldon, amy?
37313,Sheldon,"please, penny, as you know, i’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so i prepared a short video."
36102,Sheldon,"they’re right, it was the only option."
38134,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll bow to social pressure. hey!"
41970,Sheldon,"i realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago."
39133,Sheldon,"oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory.  did i say something amusing?"
37219,Sheldon,thanks for giving me your limited edition green lantern lantern.
43709,Sheldon,"no, no. this has been in my family for generations. except for a short time when comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it."
39199,Sheldon,why?
38172,Sheldon,"the only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. now, get my back, jack."
36389,Sheldon,come.
44300,Sheldon,"oh, well now, we’ll never win. you always play the drinking game."
36100,Sheldon,"excuse me, in what universe are slurpies icees?"
36630,Sheldon,did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
36883,Sheldon,"look at him. wil wheaton, my old friend, i have chased you round the moons of nibia and round the antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!"
44261,Sheldon,"because i’m a fraud. no. i purport to be a man of the mind. i’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can i leave my body behind and become one with the internet when i’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?"
38709,Sheldon,"mommy, i love you. don’t let spock take me to the future!"
45159,Sheldon,sorry. i need to work on this engine so when i get to the train yard i won’t look foolish.
38509,Sheldon,"but they’re not blonde, so put on your wig. hello?"
45709,Sheldon,me neither.
44430,Sheldon,remember when we camped out for the doctor who panel at comic-con?
43208,Sheldon,isn’t that a little juvenile?
44116,Sheldon,"because this changes everything. what about comic book night? uh, what about playing games together? what about our trips to disneyland? how can we do those things with a child around?"
43597,Sheldon,how dare you.
41487,Sheldon,i’ve made a horrible mistake.
37584,Sheldon,in the prom department.
35907,Sheldon,"go ahead, it’s pre-loosened."
41123,Sheldon,"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
36651,Sheldon, penny.
41539,Sheldon,"no, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, i wanted to discuss another matter with you."
43747,Sheldon,"oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates."
36637,Sheldon,"mother, i have to go. yeah, love you. bye.  daddy’s home."
40510,Sheldon,just tea. s’the best tea i’ve ever had.
44037,Sheldon,"here’s a fun postal fact. the inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. so, if you broke my right thumb, that’s pasadena city police. but if you broke my left thumb, that’s the fbi."
34323,Sheldon,"no we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not."
43267,Sheldon,we looked great.
39309,Sheldon,hamburgers and lemonade.
40483,Sheldon,why’s that?
40890,Sheldon,more than anything.
36125,Sheldon,was that sarca..
45460,Sheldon,yay.
41105,Sheldon,i am.
34512,Sheldon,"you’re a lucky man, leonard. "
45234,Sheldon,"you can always watch the panels online. oh, boy, we do say that a lot."
35452,Sheldon,the conqueror.
43468,Sheldon,i’m here to return your belongings. that’s what people who’ve broken up do.
35171,Sheldon,"this has nothing to do with religion. this has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother. "
43424,Sheldon,will someone take me home?
38510,Sheldon,i may have failed.
45135,Sheldon,"uh, guys, it sounds like you’re getting angry again."
44897,Sheldon,you know what? this isn’t gonna work.
35737,Sheldon,"all right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please."
40866,Sheldon,"well, the evidence does support that."
40099,Sheldon,i wasn’t talking to you.
40740,Sheldon,what kind of person leaves his keys in the car?
41915,Sheldon,she told you?
35190,Sheldon,what’s the difference?
44802,Sheldon,yes.
38694,Sheldon,i’m sorry. you’ll be spock?
35348,Sheldon,she’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.
41082,Sheldon,"well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a wonderful girlfriend, and…"
43530,Sheldon,"what a wonderful day, thank you."
44718,Sheldon,you never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.
45593,Sheldon,what? is this about leonard and amy? i don’t like it either.
37884,Sheldon,she’s not my girlfriend.
37426,Sheldon,"yes, that good news."
35981,Sheldon,"if i were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us."
41282,Sheldon,"that’s curious. if there’s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?"
42317,Sheldon,why would i? that’s where all the cool trains are.
43774,Sheldon,"oh, and forget what i said about the myanmar catfish. my list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short."
42269,Sheldon,"four keys! who does he think he is, a warden?"
44997,Sheldon,do we have to? i really don’t want to hear the religious lecture.
36328,Sheldon,hot glue.
45309,Sheldon,"you know what? i’m proud of us. yeah, with penny and leonard taking in raj, and stuart living with howard and bernadette, we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party."
35947,Sheldon,didn’t they teach you that in medical school?
34589,Sheldon,aren’t you afraid i’ll embarrass you?
38565,Sheldon,"except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. the desperate act of a little man with a big napoleon complex."
43236,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the terran sensory input paradigm."
40757,Sheldon,"i’ll eat later. right now, i’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics."
41775,Sheldon,too bad. i’m coming with you.
40685,Sheldon,"well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. let’s call this colleague ricardo shilly-shally."
40716,Sheldon,"actually, i came to speak to mrs. davis."
35085,Sheldon,"in a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”."
34632,Sheldon,"this is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story."
43399,Sheldon,"yes. if i ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like i do to you when you say dumb things."
38366,Sheldon,drat. now i’m 8 for 27.
45369,Sheldon,"you know, i felt the same way about the spork. uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? that’ll never work. spoiler, works."
40500,Sheldon,"not true. leonard made me like you. and let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. cheers, pal. ooh. boy, that is a treat that’s hard to beat. get the mad hatter on the horn, i’m having a tea party."
44522,Sheldon,"yeah, excuse me, i need to say something to someone pretty special, and i just can’t wait any longer."
40499,Sheldon,"it’s a band-aid at best. see, the core problem is that amy and wil do not like each other. which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. and i like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on star trek."
43034,Sheldon,"no, it wasn’t. uh, now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. i think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and i’m not in love with you. and psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences."
34756,Sheldon,not to mention you’d have to power down on saturdays. 
41711,Sheldon,"my mother asked me to get some towels. i took advantage of the vague request and went to bed, bath & beyond.  excuse me, i’m on the phone. so rude."
42761,Sheldon,but what about our agreement?
38606,Sheldon,"before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry i am for my earlier behaviour and how much i respect and admire your leadership."
39319,Sheldon,about halfway between bruce wayne and scrooge mcduck.
42470,Sheldon,no.
39669,Sheldon,"hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that i’m not boyfriend material."
42559,Sheldon,"you tell me. i feel like i can’t breathe, and i am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs."
41564,Sheldon,"well, you barely looked. let me see."
42010,Sheldon,but i occupy the moral high ground.
41176,Sheldon,"no one asked you, uhura."
41966,Sheldon,oh. yay.
37037,Sheldon,"one moment. according to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. there’s the handle. oh, no, too far, bringing it back. optimized. now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?"
36106,Sheldon,"oh, i see. penny, i’m not sure i’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 north los robles corporation."
35831,Sheldon,all right. leonard went to  the office.
39236,Sheldon,"when i rise to power, those people will be sterilized."
41262,Sheldon,now i know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
36444,Sheldon,"oh, i disagree. stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books."
34772,Sheldon,a little misunder…. galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding.
42609,Sheldon,bruce wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on.
37642,Sheldon,he’s in the laundry room now. now would be a good time.
37895,Sheldon,oh. i hadn’t considered that. i suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. and you don’t think i can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
35193,Sheldon,"he can’t eat cheesecake, he’s lactose intolerant. "
43172,Sheldon,honesty will never get us in.
40360,Sheldon,"it’s not a present, it’s the present. look. there’s you and me. there’s penny and amy. we’re playing pictionary. in the present."
40821,Sheldon,crazy bastard?
43146,Sheldon,"we get it, you won the game. stop bragging."
36142,Sheldon,which means his triumph will be even larger. minstrels will write songs about him.
38853,Sheldon,it’s not cool. it’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. how’d you do it?
36233,Sheldon,"we’re not flying, we’re taking the train."
41566,Sheldon,why would i flip out? is it a spider? it’s a spider.
40678,Sheldon,"well, you remember when you told me i talk in my sleep? well, it occurred to me that, like most things i say, it’s probably pure gold. so i started recording it all, and now alex gets to comb through eight hours of what i like to call sheldon after dark."
36857,Sheldon,it doesn’t matter. you can’t possibly win.
42600,Sheldon,"no. i had a date with a proper education. instead of a tuxedo, i dressed myself in good habits. instead of spiked punch, i enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. instead of dancing in a gym, i shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…"
35718,Sheldon,godzilla clause?
42571,Sheldon,"yeah, i bet you leave your patients in stitches. that was also humorous."
34403,Sheldon,why would i join you?
42356,Sheldon,"wrong, just because i enjoyed that one doesn’t mean i always do."
39405,Sheldon,"great. now, you’re going to love the perlmutter lecture. look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but i thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum amazing grace during those parts."
37780,Sheldon,"excellent. if the yogurt works, i bought some delightful scented candles."
42880,Sheldon,hey. what are you trying to pull? the president of science isn’t in here.
44928,Sheldon,"for a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-d chess?"
37557,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, that is what i meant."
37900,Sheldon,i’ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with amy farrah fowler.
35829,Sheldon,are you going to the office?
43623,Sheldon,a swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.
34707,Sheldon,what’s not to love?
36955,Sheldon,"hey, i thought of a game we can play in the car."
38155,Sheldon,what does that mean?
44504,Sheldon,"you know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist."
40861,Sheldon,it’s penny’s fault.
36340,Sheldon,camouflaging bald spots. that’s primarily a male concern. perhaps we could expand our market.
36745,Sheldon,hardly.
34381,Sheldon,please don’t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
43619,Sheldon,i’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.
37656,Sheldon,that’s not even from your franchise!
35606,Sheldon,"well, i have to tell you that while i do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, i’m not sure i’m capable of performing diagnostics."
42789,Sheldon,"boy, double-sixes again. you know, if i hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, i wouldn’t believe it. i wonder how long we’re gonna be stuck here."
43959,Sheldon,i miss you as well.
39626,Sheldon,you really need to work on your penmanship.
37457,Sheldon,but the only reason i was driving your car was because you were in distress and i was rescuing you.
42467,Sheldon,i’d like your honest opinion on something.
42493,Sheldon,"you know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. the, the geosynchronous satellite from arthur c. clarke. the motorola flip phone, that came from star trek. and i’ve long suspected that the idea of an african-american president was stolen from the movie deep impact."
44870,Sheldon,"i can’t believe i was surpassed by a geologist. i mean, rocks. he studies rocks. if rock is so great, how come paper beats it? leonard, i’m having a primal urge to throw this rock."
45208,Sheldon,"i’m sorry you were embarrassed. and now i understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, dr. fink."
37986,Sheldon,"yeah, i’ve been reading up on biomechanics. i think you’ll be surprised at my… wah! oh!"
43567,Sheldon,but mostly here.
41191,Sheldon,it was you.
34461,Sheldon,isn’t it?
38616,Sheldon,you lied to me?
44188,Sheldon,i know when i’m beat.
40864,Sheldon,"yeah, i think we should talk about that."
43717,Sheldon,excuse me?
34894,Sheldon,"oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose. "
34397,Sheldon,"no. no, now that was not my point. my point was, don’t buy a cat. "
34331,Sheldon,"this is not anyone’s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy."
36489,Sheldon,"no, it’s the accepted convention. how was your day?"
41938,Sheldon,"well, isn’t this nice. sometimes the baby wins."
36063,Sheldon,i’m making friends with this little girl. what’s your name?
45658,Sheldon,"listen carefully. i’m about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter."
35950,Sheldon,can i at least have the upper gi? i already drank the barium!
36567,Sheldon,"aw, how nice. well, a space opened up at the last minute on the nsf expedition to the arctic circle."
38124,Sheldon,i have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. you have none.
36429,Sheldon,why should i let it go? i saw it first.
36925,Sheldon,when i have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as galactica. is that what you’re wearing to watch football at penny’s?
42960,Sheldon,how does that work?
44962,Sheldon,i’m starting to rethink the flash onesie i bought this kid.
45701,Sheldon,"i’ll give you $1,000 if you’ll drive me home."
42144,Sheldon,and amy doesn’t look sick.
34797,Sheldon,so you admit that you’re an egotist?
34969,Sheldon,get him out. 
40994,Sheldon,"anyway, um, i realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence."
41733,Sheldon,"perhaps i’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. unless they’re german, ’cause that’s a tough crowd."
34911,Sheldon,"well, i didn’t hear the phone ring."
37379,Sheldon,i do.
36327,Sheldon,"penny’s making hair accessories. i’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. all right, break’s over. "
34669,Sheldon,our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people. 
38737,Sheldon,"oh, wow!"
44647,Sheldon,"like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?"
38068,Sheldon,"that’s a peculiar conclusion. by any standard, amy is more similar to me than anyone i’ve ever met."
34507,Sheldon,waitresses don’t yell at you at big boy. 
42536,Sheldon,"plus, there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked."
35986,Sheldon,"thank you, that’s very gracious.     gentlemen."
41707,Sheldon,i’m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.
35731,Sheldon,i’m just so… full.
38750,Sheldon,what’s going on?
37859,Sheldon,"well, tomorrow’s saturday. saturday night is laundry night, so i’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking."
34453,Sheldon,"no, no. let me do the math for you, this car weighs let’s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you."
37276,Sheldon,nothing. just wanted to see if you were both okay.
40169,Sheldon,said the hangman offering a noose.
42984,Sheldon,it won’t be as good.
21800,Sheldon,"all right, next question. kirk or picard?"
38030,Sheldon,you take that back.
44922,Sheldon,"well, leonard, you know, who should keep this? on the one hand, i love mr. spock more than you do. on the other hand, i care more about clocks than you do."
38732,Sheldon,"my stature intimidates her, so she’s using you to get to me. crafty old gal."
43196,Sheldon,you’re just saying that to make me feel better.
36795,Sheldon,the parade.
45380,Sheldon,what i need is to get to work.
36931,Sheldon,hold on i believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-handed. would you like to bring some cylon toast?
41618,Sheldon,no. he died when i was 14.
44052,Sheldon,"you were so cute, huffin’ and puffin’. there’s amy. i just know you’re gonna hit it off. you both have the same fashion sense. hello. come in, say hi to my meemaw."
42351,Sheldon,so your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that i can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?
40029,Sheldon,"oh, that was no joke. but i understand your confusion as i am our group’s resident cut-up."
37775,Sheldon,"oh, good grief. this isn’t about you. coming! now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. so pay attention. years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event."
35365,Sheldon,worst renaissance fair ever.
39046,Sheldon,it’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. the name literally beckons.
38058,Sheldon,"mom, what an unexpected pleasure."
39877,Sheldon,that my genius…
40406,Sheldon,"a tardis makes no sense. it’s a time machine from a science-fiction show. it has nothing to do with halloween. that being said, if you don’t get a tardis, you stink and your party stinks."
35770,Sheldon,"wait. excuse me. you forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side."
38224,Sheldon,do you prefer ointment or cream?
34728,Sheldon,"when i was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. it’s about an indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. for some reason i related to it quite strongly. "
37151,Sheldon,why are you crying?
44067,Sheldon,"my mother gave it to me, and i had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up."
35519,Sheldon,can we talk about this later.
42794,Sheldon,"oh, i learned how. amy taught me."
43562,Sheldon,"no, what i’m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me."
43523,Sheldon,what if that burning food attracts animals?
44933,Sheldon,but you don’t even understand its symbolism.
38995,Sheldon,this is remarkable. took less than 24 hours.
45415,Sheldon,"and welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of fun with flags on an episode we’re calling…"
44879,Sheldon,"top of the afternoon, gentlemen."
40011,Sheldon,"gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the republic and the light side, or the sith empire and the dark side."
38576,Sheldon,"that’s all right. i can barely hear you over my theremin.  well, that was a little uncalled for."
44382,Sheldon,"oh, i have quite the evening planned. our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast."
45542,Sheldon,howard hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.
45638,Sheldon,is that woman aishwarya rai?
44214,Sheldon,"oh, i’ve always valued education over money. and the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive i’ve been of your contributions."
40166,Sheldon,"yes, of course that’s why it’s tight."
39042,Sheldon,what happened to you?
44792,Sheldon,"well, i suppose we could find a whole new place. you know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in pasadena. we could, we could move to altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena."
42727,Sheldon,"too bad your show is done. i kind of liked it. leonard, did you hear that? oh, the people are heartbroken. i can’t take this away from the world. fun with flags is back."
41078,Sheldon,yes.
34671,Sheldon,"then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich. "
43304,Sheldon,you call tech support.
34415,Sheldon,okay.
44364,Sheldon,i shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.
37824,Sheldon,"i know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility."
39079,Sheldon,"you’re preaching to the choir, sister."
38401,Sheldon,"as usual, you’re all wrong. the bravest person in the marvel universe is the doctor who gives wolverine his prostate exam."
36262,Sheldon,"okay, i’ve found the perfect solution. we get off the train at the next stop in oxnard. we then take the 1:13 train back to union station. we take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to san luis obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we’ll meet the train."
41155,Sheldon,"oh, i don’t know about you guys, but i have been through the emotional wringer tonight."
41049,Sheldon,"i don’t want any more, but let’s go."
39526,Sheldon,this would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
39603,Sheldon,"okay, penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. an e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to sweet georgia brown. pick."
39255,Sheldon,really?
44219,Sheldon,"so, is that a yes?"
43233,Sheldon,hello.
36538,Sheldon,but the mission is for six months.
37485,Sheldon,"excuse me? excuse me, jailor?"
44155,Sheldon,but who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?
38408,Sheldon,"einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. by that standard, penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs."
42320,Sheldon,"wrong. hunt’s. hey, amy, what do you say? you ready to move on to the mustard round?"
34822,Sheldon,i need to speak to you.
41846,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, who’s angie dickinson?"
42216,Sheldon,why do i need you now?
41891,Sheldon,"oh, well, my new friend’s name was eric. um, amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude."
43273,Sheldon,"if your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you’re packed."
36631,Sheldon,freeze-dried spicy mustard?
38909,Sheldon,"be ruthless. you tell him if he doesn’t start talking, we’ll register a complaint with his internet service provider."
35400,Sheldon,pastries such as bearclaws?
36975,Sheldon,"where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do i have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?"
43004,Sheldon,"i don’t think so. leonard can’t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing."
34345,Sheldon,i am not leaving until i’m done.
35952,Sheldon,i knew it! what do i do?
40037,Sheldon,"look, it was actually designed for my vintage mr spock action figure."
38442,Sheldon,"all right, i think i have enough to go on. possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and i only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal."
40369,Sheldon,ah. so it is. i guess we both share blame on this one.
35662,Sheldon,you saw nothing! 
37544,Sheldon,"hello? oh, chancellor morton, how are you, sir? yes, i was expecting your call  problem."
36159,Sheldon,aw…
45187,Sheldon,"if you think that’s more fun than talking to zachary quinto through a stall door, you’re crazy."
34655,Sheldon,hm! 
34985,Sheldon,"oh, sure you do. now, see, what’s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?"
40566,Sheldon,keep a lookout. this place is swarming with campus security. they will not hesitate to scold us.
35332,Sheldon,it’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. recommended by the department of homeland security. and sarah connor. 
43513,Sheldon,what was that?
39134,Sheldon,so your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
38903,Sheldon,oh! there isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.
43610,Sheldon,"ah, what might have been. and you, give my regards to barnum and bailey."
45166,Sheldon,"okay, but this is the last time. nice try, blockheads."
36168,Sheldon,i know. although i’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
43679,Sheldon,"well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. that’s all i’ve got on me."
40067,Sheldon,my mr spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. and when the toy broke i switched it for yours. later he encouraged me to do the right thing and i defied him. and then i was attacked by a gorn.
44501,Sheldon,"do i say stop what, or just throw in the towel?"
43107,Sheldon,i spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
45774,Sheldon,what are you doing in my room? stop it. that’s mine. why are you so strong?
42683,Sheldon,"well, i’m not making any promises. not only did leonard take what i feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me."
42329,Sheldon,i wish i’d never gone on that trip. i feel no better now than when i left.
42334,Sheldon,your hair is different. you changed your hair. i can’t take this. i’m out.
38122,Sheldon,i sense judgment on your part.
40856,Sheldon,hello. this is sheldon.
41557,Sheldon,"yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of professor proton was alka-seltzer rocket. you said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. remember? remember that? remember?"
39613,Sheldon,i don’t watch you 24 hours a day. i don’t know what you do.
44622,Sheldon,yes. i accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
34656,Sheldon,yes. if you use my toothbrush i’ll jump out that window. please don’t come to my funeral. have a good night. 
35857,Sheldon,"uh, peace out!"
40648,Sheldon,"good king wenceslas looked out, on the feast of stephen. when the snow lay ’round about, deep and crisp and even"
43603,Sheldon,that’s ridiculous.
37787,Sheldon,"then there’s really no reason to live, is there?"
35446,Sheldon,"i believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. but returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you."
44890,Sheldon,"oh, no. a plaque? nobody wants to see this."
38532,Sheldon,"she befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder."
21844,Sheldon,it’s not an assumption. change seats with me.
43792,Sheldon,i am.
38761,Sheldon,"leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea."
38987,Sheldon,"yes, i believe so."
41869,Sheldon,wow. your life’s amazing.
35763,Sheldon,"i trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me internet banality, strike one. touching my food, strike two."
40599,Sheldon,"you know what i like to do when i’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? i bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between spider-man and spiders."
42873,Sheldon,"or do i, hmm? sir isaac newton wrote his principia while convinced he was an armadillo."
40209,Sheldon,"leonard, where did you envision marrying penny?"
36522,Sheldon,"smell that? that’s the smell of new comic books. oh, yes!"
44236,Sheldon,"fine. i’m sorry. thank you for the thoughtful gift. i really do appreciate it. as you know, i had become attached to my old laptop. but i’m sure, in time, that this one will… jeepers creepers, that started up fast."
45777,Sheldon,"oh, perhaps it’s amy coming to her senses."
45583,Sheldon,"hmm? oh, no, no, no. they’re from many famous people. see? oh, like this one. this is from patrick stewart. it says if i come to his house again, i get to meet his dogs. oh, excuse me."
43884,Sheldon,i think they say junk.
44388,Sheldon,"when i was five, i ingested a z gauge locomotive. i spent the next three days saying, i think i can pass it, i think i can pass it, i think i can pass it."
34640,Sheldon,"and another thing, there’s a certain ethic to the game, penny, a well estab…"
37493,Sheldon,"well, i hope you’re satisfied, penny. you are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today."
37432,Sheldon,with the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at bill gates’ house should i be invited.
35347,Sheldon,meh. that poster of halle berry’s a little unnerving. 
40966,Sheldon,how come i never get to do anything i want to do?
39820,Sheldon,and a funny greek letter.
42486,Sheldon,"yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit."
44935,Sheldon,"well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn’t leonard hofstadter."
37920,Sheldon,all right. it was hell.
43533,Sheldon,what’s wrong with your closet?
34206,Sheldon,i want to leave.
42127,Sheldon,"well, now that i’ve given up string theory, i’m struggling to find my next area of focus. so, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?"
35620,Sheldon,"she’s in my spot. don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot."
41500,Sheldon,"oh, no, they found the element.  no, no, stop it. i don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. how do i make them stop loving me?"
40088,Sheldon,oh!
38702,Sheldon,"i understand. oh, shelly? a man’s here to take you away to the future! be sure to pack clean underwear.”"
39634,Sheldon,then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
36642,Sheldon,"if there’s going to be a theme, i should let you know that i don’t care for luau, toga or under the sea."
42102,Sheldon,"i suppose i could see myself in a scientific boy band. of course, i’d be the dreamy one and the smart one."
36596,Sheldon,yes.
40530,Sheldon,"well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on earth are more attractive than you. that’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade."
43870,Sheldon,"for future reference, if i want to watch mean girls, i’ll stream it on netflix."
38386,Sheldon,"i will not calm down. this affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. as captain jean-luc picard once said, the line must be drawn here! this far, no farther!"
36237,Sheldon,"assuming i can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation."
36657,Sheldon,"you’re right, leonard, it’s not a big deal. all you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. that, fyi, was sarcasm. i, in fact, believe it is a big deal"
40034,Sheldon,"ah! a vintage, mint in box, 1975 mego star trek transporter with real transporter action. hot-darn!"
44998,Sheldon,"there’s always one. she gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. that one had some un-christian words in it."
35923,Sheldon,then it must be a tumour.
38602,Sheldon,i was being sarcastic.
43101,Sheldon,"i know. it’s not fair. let the anger go, buddy. you just, you relax all your muscles. except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. let’s keep those tight."
38551,Sheldon,"well, but hear me out. the atomic bomb was the manhattan project. windows 95 was originally project chicago. for our app, i would humbly suggest project nodlehs."
39792,Sheldon,"not necessary. no. i found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind."
41280,Sheldon,"oh, i can take a look at it."
42219,Sheldon,i know. let’s go see the new spider-man movie.
35455,Sheldon,afk. away from keyboard.
34850,Sheldon,"details, leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details. "
35255,Sheldon,"i like tangerine chicken, i’m not getting tangerine chicken."
41517,Sheldon,"arthur? arthur, it’s me, sheldon cooper. you may not remember because of your advanced age."
36576,Sheldon,it wasn’t. his wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
40818,Sheldon,you pick that up right now.
42039,Sheldon,"yeah, well, it’s true. but the larger size of the xbox one may keep it from overheating."
36467,Sheldon,i don’t like this game.
42302,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m at the police station. i was robbed. they took my phone, my wallet, my ipad, everything."
38347,Sheldon,i’ll reprogram howard.
41442,Sheldon,"oh, baguettes. yes, i like baguettes. what exactly are you doing?"
39334,Sheldon,"oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, leonard. i’m so sorry."
34726,Sheldon,"no, no, princess punchali from the monkey and the princess. "
43323,Sheldon,"doctor hofstadter, i want you to meet my mother, mary."
41626,Sheldon,ain’t she great? 
35221,Sheldon,"something he wouldn’t buy for himself. something fun. something like… oh, an 802.11n wireless router. "
34222,Sheldon,no. we’re going to start season two of battlestar galactica.
34400,Sheldon,no. the dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. what time is your date?
43415,Sheldon,i didn’t want to come in. i was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. so i’ll just stay out here and pretend that i don’t have to go to the bathroom.
34826,Sheldon,"never mind. i clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle, you’re in no state to talk."
38475,Sheldon,not so fast. infinite sheldon.
44323,Sheldon,"well, you have to go. it’s penny’s first time leading the pledge of allegiance."
40713,Sheldon,"i don’t see why i’m the one being persecuted here. dr. hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. you know, and howard wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. oh, and at the office christmas party, i heard rajesh koothrappali refer to you several times as brown sugar."
43795,Sheldon,they gave one to that baby. he wasn’t even awake.
40052,Sheldon,"no. if i got on the bridge of the enterprise, i would never, ever leave."
38885,Sheldon,no.
36020,Sheldon,"i did this. monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. no matter what anybody says, this is my fault."
35661,Sheldon,"good morning, gentlemen."
39869,Sheldon,"ah, seeing as i’m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. don’t let me have too many of those."
43769,Sheldon,"well, i’m calling because thanksgiving is coming up, and i wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets."
38714,Sheldon,"hold on. just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn’t mean you should jump into his windowless van. what’s the occasion?"
42514,Sheldon,ow. that was your fault.
45067,Sheldon,"hmm. yeah, you’re right. it’s like when i first encountered the pythagorean theorem. you know, i was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. but now i’m just like, eh."
44630,Sheldon,"oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. all the same emotions i feel in line at space mountain."
36115,Sheldon,i see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like wolverine.
34970,Sheldon,you think i haven’t considered it? you really think i haven’t considered it? 
44418,Sheldon,"oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases."
40853,Sheldon,spicy mustard from the korean deli?
35481,Sheldon,no she doesn’t.
40657,Sheldon,"oh, it’s like i’m really there."
36731,Sheldon,"well, apparently, i was wrong. congratulations."
43473,Sheldon,"it’s not yours? oh, my. how embarrassing for both of us."
37201,Sheldon,i don’t understand. what other kind of women are there?
34955,Sheldon,here’s the problem with teleportation.
37454,Sheldon,"penny, i have an eidetic memory. also, that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder."
35869,Sheldon,"excuse me. when i come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?  look at that, there’s even pasta left over."
36879,Sheldon,"it might also interest you to know that wil wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director joel schumacher, who nearly destroyed the batman movie franchise, and billy sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle."
40456,Sheldon,"oh, but if i do, i’ll be a phony, a sellout, a hollywood poser."
43999,Sheldon,i want you to know that that is sincere. i do feel bad. i’m not just saying it to be included on your trip.
36928,Sheldon,"leonard, wait. am i correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?"
43447,Sheldon,"thank you. and slam it hard, because i am pretty steamed."
44512,Sheldon,"what? but he’s a mediocre academic. and according to beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. he’s basically leonard with a bigger prostate."
43025,Sheldon,we’re not supposed to talk during this part.
43763,Sheldon,"careful, it’s addictive."
40759,Sheldon,don’t waste my time.
43882,Sheldon,"so, can you help me?"
38246,Sheldon,well alfred has secrets too.
39016,Sheldon,"oh, that’s ridiculous. a bathroom emergency is self-explanatory."
40419,Sheldon,"i’ll walk you through it. the game is not called words with strangers. no, it’s not even called words with acquaintances. it is called words with…"
35038,Sheldon,army ants. 
36031,Sheldon,"really? that seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. why don’t you take some time to reconsider?"
36909,Sheldon,sorry won’t bring their kites down. ow! string burn! string burn!
39920,Sheldon,"no, i hate them, but it gets worse. there it is."
35679,Sheldon,my hypotheses tend to have that effect.
45527,Sheldon,i got the blues. my baby done left me.
38901,Sheldon,see if raj is done with pilates.
41905,Sheldon,wait. is this really worth it? we’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.
42099,Sheldon,"oh, there are so many exciting areas. black holes, dark matter."
44202,Sheldon,"okay, you got it. see, i was afraid it was a thinker."
35653,Sheldon,"no, i’m not giving up, i never give up."
35205,Sheldon,"you can’t do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it’s no longer mint."
45235,Sheldon,"you put me in charge of your finances. if you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked leonard."
36167,Sheldon,you went to the comic book store without me.7
39555,Sheldon,"oh, i guess i was wrong."
38563,Sheldon,"well, that speaks volumes, doesn’t it? all right, i suppose i’ll go put on my bus pants."
36082,Sheldon,"hello, everyone. i brought my new friend, barry kripke, home for dinner."
45417,Sheldon,"so let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start. how, howard, flashback sounds."
42235,Sheldon,have you had intercourse?
35064,Sheldon,formal protest.
40027,Sheldon,quantum physics makes me so happy.
36276,Sheldon,"yes, i’m still here. where am i going? i’m on a train. now, what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. hoberman’s sphere. it’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. no, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock."
45035,Sheldon,"wait, so how does the story end? is the baby a jerk or is bernadette a bad mother?"
41027,Sheldon,"i won’t be able to make our date night this thursday, so, bad news for you."
36868,Sheldon,i have money.
44788,Sheldon,"hey, i get it. everybody wants to spend more time with me. i’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants."
44111,Sheldon,"i’m glad you asked. amy, you have a confetto in your nose. no, no, no, no. other side. there you go."
45511,Sheldon,i apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.
40175,Sheldon,"i must say, i was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. as i mentioned, the pasadena city council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the lego store is having a midnight madness sale. you ask anyone, that’s a hot date."
37106,Sheldon,perhaps there’s hope for you after all.
42750,Sheldon,"hmm. let’s see, what do i know about amy? she loves medieval literature, chaucer’s her favourite. and her eyes sparkle when she watches old french movies. i enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along."
35466,Sheldon,"you can’t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my lord it’s like the car key in your apartment door all over again."
44515,Sheldon,"hang on, hang on. we’re smart, we can figure this out. okay, so: mary and beverley can’t be together. uh, alfred and beverley can’t be together. leonard and i can’t be together. now, i could be with alfred but i don’t like his face. oh, here. i’ve got it."
42291,Sheldon,legoland is not the solution to everything. and it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out.
36684,Sheldon,i forgive you. let’s go home.
43865,Sheldon,hello.
41122,Sheldon,"met my childhood hero, now i get to ride in an ambulance. boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever."
43579,Sheldon,"technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. swash referring to the sound of the sword. swash. and then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have."
21827,Sheldon,"never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress. and next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds."
40372,Sheldon,lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.
35556,Sheldon,did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
34965,Sheldon,nope. goodbye. 
36417,Sheldon,all right. let’s go to the comic book store.
34584,Sheldon,"like jane goodall observing the apes, i initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. "
34402,Sheldon,not if you’re a rugby team. 
44095,Sheldon,"you know what, that’s not a flag question. next caller."
34862,Sheldon,"okay, sure. i don’t see a problem with that. "
35705,Sheldon,"um… she distracted me. i told you, penny, i don’t have time for your nonsense, i have important things to do."
37542,Sheldon,i won?
39418,Sheldon,"look at the two of us. me, a highly regarded physicist. the kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. you, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. but deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. a regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. rain. another great equalizer. falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike.  smarty-pants."
45524,Sheldon,"thank you, but i’ll be fine."
39230,Sheldon,you didn’t let me finish. dinfast . are those soy-based candles?
42038,Sheldon,"okay, now, the ps4 is more angular and sleek-looking."
45026,Sheldon,"delighted? what., not if i guessed for a hundred years."
43892,Sheldon,it’s kind of spooky.
40216,Sheldon,"well, what if it’s his only way out? i can’t risk it. here is twelve dollars. now, we’re even. wait, wait, wait, i bought a card. give me two dollars. and for the record, this is why i hate gift-giving."
42233,Sheldon,can’t happen. we have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
45207,Sheldon,"no, i was just excited to list him as a friend."
36711,Sheldon,"fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and i’ll take possession of your fantastic four."
40773,Sheldon,"because i’m not interested in getting published in mad magazine. zingers fly fast in the thunderdome, barry."
43127,Sheldon,"leonard, please. his mother just died."
44664,Sheldon,"well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?"
35619,Sheldon,good morning.
43314,Sheldon,you act like i didn’t get you that mushroom log on valentine’s day.
41973,Sheldon,"well, truth be told, as a child, i did dream of going to space. those astronauts were my heroes. and when you got to go, it was hard for me."
37366,Sheldon,that seems acceptable.
41824,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention."
34426,Sheldon,"at the last department party, dr finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes."
42950,Sheldon,"well, it would be, except that i left string theory because i decided it was a dead end. yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. my rival, no less. i’m sorry you had to see that."
36627,Sheldon,"all right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. i suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled."
41037,Sheldon,you’re here.
38010,Sheldon,"oh, yes. you should’ve been here for the great jenga tantrum of 2008."
36645,Sheldon,"oh, yes. in the world of emoticons, i was colon, capital d."
43388,Sheldon,"hello. listen, i’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and i think…"
35908,Sheldon,"no, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. this is something i long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. open it. "
41186,Sheldon,"this is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section."
39109,Sheldon,"oh, there’s no need to interact with me. i’m just here to observe."
39152,Sheldon,"no, i haven’t. it’s all good."
40790,Sheldon,we do?
40978,Sheldon,i did.
38745,Sheldon,"just a few things you may need tonight. there’s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something i procured from the school of pharmacology. they say it is to viagra as viagra is to a green m&m."
35720,Sheldon,and i could not have done it without you.
35296,Sheldon,"interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans. "
45186,Sheldon,"well, have a lovely evening."
38355,Sheldon,no. the cushion is merely symbolic. i’m giving you my spot on the couch.
38352,Sheldon,there’s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.
37177,Sheldon,"neither do i, but it’s the social convention."
42019,Sheldon,you may have a point. i love my mother. even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
45738,Sheldon,"ah, just as well. where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?"
40310,Sheldon,"but, then mark ruffalo was the hulk in the avengers, and he was even better."
37799,Sheldon,did you once again ignore your check engine light?
44010,Sheldon,wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while i take a quick…?
34537,Sheldon,"oh, that is so… so…"
36137,Sheldon,"leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?"
45115,Sheldon,"what, leonard, please. i know an angry face when i see it. it’s this red frowny guy on my phone."
45062,Sheldon,yes.
43485,Sheldon,"but enough about the czech republic. let’s talk about the time moldova made romania a birthday cake and romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. and yet romania gets dumped. i’ll pause here while you mull that one over. i know, right?"
40352,Sheldon,"he left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero."
35239,Sheldon,"yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else. "
38001,Sheldon,"kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. a central african power block is formed, colonizing north africa and europe. when war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. kenya withers, uganda triumphs."
39894,Sheldon,you’re in my spot.
44009,Sheldon,i’m afraid it can’t. the trip is tomorrow. and i have more apologies to make.
35704,Sheldon,i formally request sanctuary.
38645,Sheldon,"good evening, leonard, howard, raj, freeloader."
37421,Sheldon,"since i rarely hug, i’m relying on your expertise regarding duration."
43856,Sheldon,"so, you agree with my friends that i should skip the premiere?"
34511,Sheldon,"well i assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. an alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. as in, oh look, leonard and lesley made mr and mrs goldfarb, aren’t they adorable. "
44044,Sheldon,"and that’s not helpful. you know, i got her an iphone for christmas. i’ll see where she is."
35876,Sheldon,"my apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. leonard, you want to slide over one?"
44389,Sheldon,"what an interesting question. when i was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. i could line them up, categorize them, control them. i guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t."
41332,Sheldon,"a crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army."
41943,Sheldon,are you sure? we were making fun of failed careers. we didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is howard’s.
39825,Sheldon,stop! i’m going to wet myself!
44307,Sheldon,"no, he didn’t do anything. so i said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? you know? may, maybe i should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer."
36513,Sheldon,homesick is a type of being sick.
35226,Sheldon,"penny! if i’m going to buy leonard a gift, i’m going to do it right. i refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma i did. "
43301,Sheldon,wrong. obesity.
36078,Sheldon,what part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
45776,Sheldon,"land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring."
42097,Sheldon,"oh, how about bill gates meets nikola tesla?"
43729,Sheldon,they’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.
44511,Sheldon,what? in the chattahoochee national forest in georgia? i can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.
36688,Sheldon,perhaps what leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
41407,Sheldon,"oh, no, i got bored with that. i’m just browsing cuticle scissors on amazon."
41879,Sheldon,excuse me. i think you’re being a little rude.
35999,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming southern california robot fighting league round robin invitational?"
35918,Sheldon,"oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, kal-el."
42924,Sheldon,"yeah, but it’s still so aggravating."
38158,Sheldon,i don’t want the next level. i like this level. fix it for me!
42689,Sheldon,why didn’t you stop me?
39268,Sheldon,no.
40152,Sheldon,it’s not bad. unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.
39181,Sheldon,"as your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. please sign."
36658,Sheldon,about what? being betrayed by my friends? spending three months at the north pole for nothing? and i didn’t even get to go to comic-con!
38685,Sheldon,"oh, and we’re going to use props?"
34705,Sheldon,you seemed confused.
41588,Sheldon,there’s probably a deep reason. which i’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.
35068,Sheldon,i don’t understand the question. 
42773,Sheldon,"and since you’re green this time, i can be it next time."
42710,Sheldon,i have no idea. because the story of me sewing the first american flag is unsupported poppycock.
35513,Sheldon,"yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for penny."
43258,Sheldon,"get together tonight? leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor raj a chance to come up with what we should do. go ahead, raj."
39400,Sheldon,now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.
43783,Sheldon,"i don’t know if i’d call it discussing. you kind of sat back and let me do all the work. let’s see, what’s next on the list. oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use."
42293,Sheldon,"good lord. padawan’s the student, not the teacher."
35580,Sheldon,i didn’t. let’s go.
35240,Sheldon,why? 
35145,Sheldon,so what? i don’t issue invitations to your mother.
34226,Sheldon,that’s the beauty of it.
44778,Sheldon,dayaj’a’ 
44826,Sheldon,"i understand. she’s the mean one, i’m the fun one."
40596,Sheldon,"it is, right behind do-do-do-do-do inspector gadget., and teenage mutant ninja turtles, heroes in a half-shell."
38050,Sheldon,clowder.
45479,Sheldon,"amy, look, i’m on a unicycle!"
37209,Sheldon,i don’t need anything at the galleria. do you need anything at the galleria?
40385,Sheldon,i’m okay. i’m okay. i’m not okay.
35060,Sheldon,"well that’s a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, i answer the questions."
45541,Sheldon,it’s hard to say. i’ve never really lived by myself. what if i become strange and eccentric?
37891,Sheldon,"yes, exactly. consequently, if amy and i choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. is your womb available for rental?"
37697,Sheldon,"ah, i do so love beverages. now i think i’ll take my after-dinner walk."
36951,Sheldon,you accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. lose one turn and a retina.
44113,Sheldon,"well, you be sure to let us know when you win the nobel prize for boysenberry."
38515,Sheldon,what’s the bad news?
34562,Sheldon,a halloween party?
34938,Sheldon,"based on what happened next, i assume it means “would you like an enema?”"
36541,Sheldon,"yeah, i have to say, i thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. "
38514,Sheldon,oh.
41680,Sheldon,fine.
37039,Sheldon,"yes. as soon as i adjust my seat. whee! oh, dear. i’m going to have to start again."
40888,Sheldon,what is that?
36807,Sheldon,"understandable. your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best."
41515,Sheldon,"look at him, just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. let’s go say hello."
37860,Sheldon,"i would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery."
37345,Sheldon, leonard and penny.
34890,Sheldon,sick? 
43085,Sheldon,"oh, maybe you’re right. he is kind of a lump."
41342,Sheldon,come on.
38996,Sheldon,"interesting. so it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were."
40677,Sheldon,"no, i was wrong. the looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. i’ve never felt so alive.  oh, hello, alex. uh, let me go get you last night’s recordings."
39341,Sheldon,"and then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. love it."
42688,Sheldon,try and stop me.
45304,Sheldon,beverley believes i unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.
35389,Sheldon,you want me to leave the apartment?
38198,Sheldon,that’s what i said.
38354,Sheldon,"nevertheless, i’ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, i want you to have this."
39700,Sheldon,"it’s in her book, needy baby, greedy baby."
39441,Sheldon,be sure to check the mail.
40366,Sheldon,there.
41019,Sheldon,even you. you’re a slave.
44527,Sheldon,"what, you’re not my mother."
44591,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. yes, of course."
37239,Sheldon,"it means come in. it’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. i disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now i thought i’d learn finnish."
36562,Sheldon, leonard.
43410,Sheldon,"why? is there someone else? just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?"
41182,Sheldon,"very well. things between you and penny have never been better. i hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. i should have opened with that, huh?"
44487,Sheldon,"see, that’s funny because…"
34247,Sheldon,tuesday night we played klingon boggle until one in the morning.
43344,Sheldon,"i’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? still, you need to consider how successful leonard’s brother and sister are."
37045,Sheldon,why do you have the chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?
43197,Sheldon,agreed.
37213,Sheldon,"let me offer you a compromise. sometimes when i feel stifled and want a change of scenery, i use my imagination."
42442,Sheldon,"yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the mesozoic spot."
42640,Sheldon,very well. i’m done talking about it.
41214,Sheldon,back to the future ii was in the back to the future iii case. leonard did it.
43411,Sheldon,and who’s this guy you’re taking?
35776,Sheldon,what are you implying?
39596,Sheldon, bernadette.
42724,Sheldon,"i posted the last episode of fun with flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. all that effort for nothing."
42966,Sheldon,are you sure?
39445,Sheldon,"it is, isn’t it? oh, bother. isn’t that just always the way? you go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. gosh, i wish i’d known that earlier today when i was at staples."
41682,Sheldon,"that’s right, sheldon cooper. he was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. which, sadly, he couldn’t build because santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium."
43701,Sheldon,"aquaman, protecting your home since 2012."
41392,Sheldon,"wait, hang on. you’ve spent time with amy. can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed?"
34757,Sheldon,"well, there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but occam’s razor would suggest that someone threw it out. "
44027,Sheldon,aha.
38089,Sheldon,because…
40358,Sheldon,got it.
37472,Sheldon,excellent. go on.
37730,Sheldon, leonard.
34611,Sheldon,you’re in trouble. 
45597,Sheldon,"because there’s only one of me, i’m more valuable."
36626,Sheldon,"of course not. even in my sleep-deprived state, i’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. bazinga!"
37608,Sheldon,"oh, lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating."
42410,Sheldon,"oh. well, then come or don’t. i don’t care."
42255,Sheldon,"good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish."
34667,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, we cannot do this without wolowitz."
36003,Sheldon,"now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, i withdraw that comment."
44725,Sheldon,"stuart, this is bert from the caltech geology lab, and this is mrs. petrescu from downstairs."
40096,Sheldon,how do i do that?
38248,Sheldon,ta-da!
34367,Sheldon,we could put her stereo back there.
44553,Sheldon,"not really. but i’m mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is."
45287,Sheldon,"i know, i know, good grief was originally said by charlie brown, geez."
37064,Sheldon,"i see. now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?"
35361,Sheldon,"okay, i’ll tell you, but you can’t tell leonard. "
35527,Sheldon,what people?
36338,Sheldon,"penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, i’d strongly recommend that we let leonard go."
39861,Sheldon,maybe that’s because i’m not being challenged. it’s the same reason einstein failed math.
36252,Sheldon,"interesting that you ask. the coast starlight recently added the refurbished pacific parlour car. built in 1956 and originally known as the santa fe lounge car, the lower level is a theatre…"
42676,Sheldon,very well.
44099,Sheldon,i don’t see why not.
35823,Sheldon,"all right, goodbye."
40124,Sheldon,"what is it now, mrs. wolowitz?"
44397,Sheldon,"you’re parched and weary from battle. you stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm."
44845,Sheldon,"good choice, it’s disgusting."
39510,Sheldon,"i’m begging both of you, please, let’s go."
44918,Sheldon,"although, amy and i did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift."
39661,Sheldon,"not much. although, i can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. i don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, i just melt inside."
40017,Sheldon,that is the most sickeningly sweet thing i have ever experienced. and i am sipping kool-aid through a red vine.
43495,Sheldon,"well, that was fun. good for you, leonard."
39536,Sheldon,"yes. it’s very sweet. now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet."
42095,Sheldon,the magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
41226,Sheldon,"by the way, how are you with zippers?"
39395,Sheldon,"i’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us."
36256,Sheldon,so we have to go back.
35276,Sheldon,okay. i think this will be my seat. 
36737,Sheldon,a chicken that was owned by mrs. riley.
38894,Sheldon,wait a minute! you’re not going to do anything?
39773,Sheldon,right here. use your finger.
40689,Sheldon,"okay, look, it’s not really about ricardo and tondelaya. it is really about her boss, who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because dr. einstein von brainstorm, he’s usually pretty smart about these things."
34787,Sheldon,how’d that work out for you?
38983,Sheldon,and a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
36132,Sheldon,"oh, good. dinner’s here."
45326,Sheldon,"okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, i have the final say. in matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. unless i disagree. oh, here. number two, when we publish,"
37255,Sheldon,"perhaps. perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. for all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters."
42214,Sheldon,you’re back.
37887,Sheldon,"amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow."
39685,Sheldon,what time did you tell amy to be here?
39823,Sheldon,ha. perfect. okay. get this. professor jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. five times the limit of e to the upsilon as in a 
42490,Sheldon,i’m sorry. is that a no?
37268,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, that’s the end of your inquiry?"
43403,Sheldon,amy’s upset? is it about me?
43773,Sheldon,"very well, then. i’ll see you on thanksgiving morning."
42865,Sheldon,yeah.
39246,Sheldon,what?
43508,Sheldon,"how can you be sure? vhs was king when feynman drove this van. for all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with jane fonda workout videos."
45150,Sheldon,no idea. all i know is i’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
38771,Sheldon,"priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that leonard and penny used to, if i may quote howard, do the dance with no pants."
42987,Sheldon,you didn’t even let me finish.
42969,Sheldon,"she’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. i was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. that’s when amy said, want to make this interesting?"
41659,Sheldon,"by taking away my only claim to fame? well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends."
36768,Sheldon,"you know, i’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub."
36829,Sheldon,what?
42822,Sheldon,like a big old baby.
40769,Sheldon,"yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!"
35621,Sheldon,department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? but i don’t have a problem.
37035,Sheldon,"yes, and i have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator."
34568,Sheldon,"see, this is why i wanted to have a costume meeting. "
38636,Sheldon,"good morning and welcome to science and society. i’m dr. sheldon cooper, bs, ms, ma, phd, and scd. omg, right? perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. all right then, we’ll begin with opening remarks. miss rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?"
34710,Sheldon,"understandable, but there’s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity."
43837,Sheldon,yes. she’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. i have to go.
39355,Sheldon,"well, i started the list when i was nine."
35942,Sheldon,"oh, she is. she’s terrific, and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate."
38736,Sheldon,"no. but we have potatoes, i could make you vodka. it’ll take two weeks."
41449,Sheldon,bleugh!
40172,Sheldon,keys! keys! keys!
37179,Sheldon,my bad. i did send a gift from both of us.
36152,Sheldon,"this should be fairly easy to deduce. he’s holding the phone to his left ear. ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller."
36648,Sheldon,of course it was. the whole plan reeks of leonard.
41429,Sheldon,too late. no backsies.
44159,Sheldon,"no, i just, i got a little light-headed."
45783,Sheldon,whoopee!
41349,Sheldon,"oh, see? now he gets it."
39711,Sheldon,where?
36824,Sheldon,"oh, pulling strings, are we?"
38804,Sheldon,"wonderful. dinner, some assembly required."
37065,Sheldon,"oh, good, my turn. well, this is very exciting and i wanted you to be among the first to know…"
45506,Sheldon,"if that’s sarcasm, please save it for our enemies."
43961,Sheldon,"my fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a yosemite waterfall."
36933,Sheldon, penny.
45810,Sheldon,"you think you have me stymied, don’t you?"
40390,Sheldon,that’s rude.
37648,Sheldon,"what? no! again, it’s not the wesley crushers. it’s the wesley “crushers.”"
37800,Sheldon,"leonard, penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work."
37228,Sheldon,thank you. and what is my function as wingman?
42827,Sheldon,you sounded in distress. i was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. like a murder. or spontaneous coitus with leonard.
37294,Sheldon,wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.
38505,Sheldon,"i’m the flash. i just knocked 30,000 times."
41385,Sheldon,"i’ll tell you why. amy ruined raiders of the lost ark for me, so now i’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that."
35301,Sheldon,well i assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? because i’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate. 
38969,Sheldon,i’ve been thinking about dr. greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.
42446,Sheldon,hello.
39725,Sheldon,"well, i doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine."
39628,Sheldon,i help the weak. it’s yet another way i’m exactly like batman.
36240,Sheldon,what on earth are you doing?
37592,Sheldon,"really, leonard? you’re just going to try to recycle adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? i could probably get that from the woman at ralph’s. and she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free."
36793,Sheldon,"yes. since their relationship became carnal, penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult."
39048,Sheldon,you own a smoking monkey?
42248,Sheldon,"it’s an outrage. honestly, i’m tempted to leave the university."
39269,Sheldon,"you’re good friends with penny, right?"
45295,Sheldon,i have.
40384,Sheldon,how could you not find him?
40128,Sheldon,humorous. now will you please present my paper to professor hawking?
37613,Sheldon,"for the record, giant rats are possible."
44688,Sheldon,have you noticed it’s always an a-flat?
39202,Sheldon,what does it look like?
39357,Sheldon,"interesting. you see betrayal in others, but not yourself."
40512,Sheldon,you insulted my woman. i’m here to defend her honour. two! it was two.  wil wheaton! now prepare yourself for what may come.
42370,Sheldon,"okay. um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?"
38697,Sheldon,hoo!
40437,Sheldon,then suffer in silence. play. play. play.  stephen hawking.
42314,Sheldon,"i do, but, i feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers."
41035,Sheldon,bad. however…
43757,Sheldon,uh-oh. what if it’s jennifer lawrence?
44509,Sheldon,or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
43975,Sheldon,"you know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?"
44384,Sheldon,cinnamon toast?
45670,Sheldon,"i have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, i will wait for you to finish your current conversation. what are you talking about?"
39594,Sheldon,mutual indemnification always is. why don’t you start perusing while i set up my notary stamp.
39737,Sheldon,"now, today’s episode of fun with flags is not fun, but it is important. flags: you gotta know how to hold ’em, you gotta know how to fold ’em. let’s start by identifying the parts of our flag. this edge is the hoist, and it’s used to…"
34630,Sheldon,"uh, no. the wheel was a great idea. relativity was a great idea. this is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that. "
45444,Sheldon,"that’s a good one. okay, now, leonard, you tell a joke."
38202,Sheldon,i’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
37062,Sheldon,"that’s a fairly laboured metaphor, but i appreciate the sentiment behind it."
40584,Sheldon,"well, howard, thank you. it’s quite a gesture on your part. you’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man."
43917,Sheldon,that sounds awful. raj?
40340,Sheldon,stems removed?
38394,Sheldon,you whistled?
37336,Sheldon,they lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
39691,Sheldon,you ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
43576,Sheldon,"or worse, up."
38571,Sheldon,"greetings, gentlemen. how goes your little project?"
42365,Sheldon,why would you do that?
45632,Sheldon,aieee ya! xia si wo le. 
38795,Sheldon,"oh, dear!"
44157,Sheldon,but this is my birthday suit. are you having a stroke? because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.
35664,Sheldon,the truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. but why should i cater to second-rate minds?
35178,Sheldon,"exactly. now, i am not saying that i should be the sole decider of who you mate with. if you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced."
35175,Sheldon,"truthfully, i’ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry dna of great potential."
37234,Sheldon,hello.
42398,Sheldon,i told you you weren’t smart enough to take it.
42875,Sheldon,"amy, i have gotten more done in the last few days than i have since i made the switch to dark matter. what if i stop doing this, and it all goes away?"
38206,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down."
43269,Sheldon,"oh, i recommend that, too. that was a magical experience."
40222,Sheldon,"i must admit, i can’t help but feel a twinge of envy. he can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. his dim, uncomprehending eyes. it’s like a cat in an airport carrying case."
35157,Sheldon,"i didn’t say it was fascinating, i said it was noteworthy."
42817,Sheldon,"well, i’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay. i’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. see, i’ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. uh, i have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. and then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade richard feynman."
41459,Sheldon,you’re not listening to my side of it.
34429,Sheldon,"how’s this? pleased to meet you, dr gablehouser. how fortunate for you that the university has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. mahalo."
34455,Sheldon,"interesting. anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let’s say, 4,400lb."
34657,Sheldon,"every saturday since we have lived in this apartment, i have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on bbc america and watched doctor who. "
38828,Sheldon,"that’s very nice, stuart. zack?"
40691,Sheldon,"well, what should i do?"
39244,Sheldon,"it is. aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. this is a chair worthy of the name."
35835,Sheldon,leonard is going to  the office.
45220,Sheldon,"well, last night amy was angry with me because i’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters."
38617,Sheldon,"good morning. if i could have everyone’s attention, please? i know we’re all eager to get on the road to big sur, so if we focus, i’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. then it’s just q&a, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off."
37235,Sheldon,"in brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight."
37810,Sheldon,and not-a-doctor howard wolowitz.
42284,Sheldon,you tracked my phone?
44083,Sheldon,"i just gave you my virginity, woman. cool your jets."
37534,Sheldon,subliminal messaging. i’m going to make you want to pee. dripping faucets. leaky gutter. peeing.
37275,Sheldon,"we just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?"
39821,Sheldon,i said funny.
45012,Sheldon,"yeah. and i don’t understand why you’re taking her side. by being my girlfriend, she’s saying you’re a weirdo, too."
40806,Sheldon,i didn’t notice.
44702,Sheldon,"since amy and i have been living together, we’ve been bickering like my parents used to."
42353,Sheldon,"awful. they’re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class."
34739,Sheldon,exactly the kind of spirit with which princess punchali led the monkeys to freedom. 
44737,Sheldon,your handwriting is impeccable.
34672,Sheldon,"he’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  where he comes from, that’s punishable by death."
39946,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. i’m looking for a barber and i’m running out of time. my hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. i mean, if you’re quiet, you can hear it."
36430,Sheldon,a far less impressive feat.
44129,Sheldon,"you guys, the bathroom here is amazing. there’s people cooking in it."
42802,Sheldon,"well, i’m sorry, too. and if you want to live with penny, then i think you should."
36007,Sheldon,make it so.
42152,Sheldon,"but to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah."
42614,Sheldon,"oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. it’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants."
44387,Sheldon,"h-o gauge trains are 1/87th scale. n gauge are 1/160th scale. and that brings us to z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don’t ask how i know, 1 to 220."
36894,Sheldon,"the year was 1995, the place, jackson, mississippi. having spent ten hours on a bus, during which i had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, i finally arrived at the fourth annual dixie-trek convention only to find that my idol wil wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure."
35290,Sheldon,"well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. the image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from scooby doo cartoons comes to mind. "
37408,Sheldon,"yeah, i used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. if you need to void your bladder before eating, i can keep them warm with this beret that i thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy."
41788,Sheldon,do you see me drinking lemonade?
41263,Sheldon,and here’s another interesting weather fact.
39787,Sheldon,"how about your grandparents, they alive?"
42117,Sheldon,it’s not my friend. nothing happened.
34467,Sheldon,"well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?"
35685,Sheldon,"you don’t tackle the big issues, ramona. you fence with them. en garde. riposte."
35997,Sheldon,"yeah, this is an auspicious moment. yeah, like robert oppenheimer or neil armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event."
35924,Sheldon,is that possible? i used to get those all the time. even in church.
38985,Sheldon,hey.
39514,Sheldon,that doesn’t help.
44699,Sheldon,"my mother was at bible study. i walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and i heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom. when i opened the door, i saw my father having relations with another woman."
35537,Sheldon,i often forget other people have limitations. it’s so sad.
35899,Sheldon,"so, have you and i returned to a social equilibrium?"
45042,Sheldon,"that’s small. so, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?"
35810,Sheldon,"no, no, no. star trek v has specific failures in writing and direction, while star trek i fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing."
44144,Sheldon,"just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? i suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? you know, the answer, it may surprise you."
36294,Sheldon,you have to sign this.
39390,Sheldon,offer them a hot beverage.
40653,Sheldon,i think the word you’re looking for is bravo.
38951,Sheldon,ba-dum-bump.
41152,Sheldon,"yeah, uh, wait. doesn’t he say something first? you know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?"
41245,Sheldon,"well, if it’s any consolation, i’m sure leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips."
42965,Sheldon,what if i told you that over the past few months amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?
38727,Sheldon,"oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!"
41620,Sheldon,"no, sir. he did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but i was 11 and my mom said no."
36021,Sheldon,"so what do you think, howard? it’s not that bad, right?"
37596,Sheldon,"thank you, leonard."
35521,Sheldon,i’ll tell you why.
39991,Sheldon,"well, she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume."
34574,Sheldon,it’s 7:05. 
39468,Sheldon,"well, i thought he made that up. isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of jewish people?"
34930,Sheldon,good. good.
39287,Sheldon,"i don’t want to talk about it. but it’s not a spine,i’ll tell you that."
40443,Sheldon,"wolowitz told me he’s a big baby. but i didn’t know that, and i played extract for 82 points. it’s all amy’s fault. she told me to play it. i have got to cut her loose."
37504,Sheldon,"of course not. and, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city."
42083,Sheldon,your relationship with leonard?
34775,Sheldon,oh. i hadn’t thought about it like that. i wonder if i’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil. 
37356,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. good night to you, too. oh, by the way, i was watching you sleep for a moment, and i noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back."
42143,Sheldon,fusion and asians? i’m trying not to think about science.
38638,Sheldon,excuse me. we’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
34834,Sheldon,"oh, alright. leonard."
40078,Sheldon,and you never answered me. so who owes whom an apology now?
38456,Sheldon,"the supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. if this one under or over-softens, i’ll need time to make things right."
39245,Sheldon,chair.
44448,Sheldon,what if each of those people let someone cut?
34370,Sheldon,and if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing. 
42942,Sheldon,since when do you help out barry kripke?
36127,Sheldon,did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? another fascinating example is the epaulet.
39071,Sheldon,three.
36615,Sheldon,"i want a cookie, meemaw."
41689,Sheldon,"no, i will be uncle dr. cooper."
38101,Sheldon,"all right, you’ve made your point. a fine prank, very amusing. now get it out."
35752,Sheldon,you and i have a standing tv schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.
39632,Sheldon,one for good luck. must be the kind of math they do at princeton.
36692,Sheldon,"you’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?"
45603,Sheldon,"and i with you. question, are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?"
45535,Sheldon,"okay. oh, and just to be clear, i’m not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going."
44543,Sheldon,"this must be how you practice law in boca raton, by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say."
42419,Sheldon,not as well as we do.
35140,Sheldon,rajesh. 
36066,Sheldon,oh good! you’re just in time. i believe i’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.
44139,Sheldon,you’re kidding. what kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom?
45675,Sheldon,is that really necessary? good lord. the interference pattern in the fracture. the motion of the wave through the molecular structure. i’ve been looking at it all wrong. i can’t consider the electrons as particles. they move through the graphene as a wave. it’s a wave! the moment to applaud would be now. troglodytes.
21852,Sheldon,"hmm, i’m still not comfortable. of course. there’s too many people here."
35576,Sheldon,"oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up."
38508,Sheldon,don’t worry. wonder woman was an amazon. and amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
45584,Sheldon,"oh, hello, amy."
43522,Sheldon,"yes, we could use science. but it’s your bachelor party. lighten up."
43541,Sheldon,"well, in addition to amy leaving me, leonard’s moving in with penny. it’s difficult not to feel abandoned."
35442,Sheldon,"well that’s not surprising. that baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system."
45575,Sheldon,"yes, we skyped this morning and i’m sure i’ll check in with her before i go to sleep."
35955,Sheldon,like what?
43400,Sheldon,whatever.
38626,Sheldon,no.
39630,Sheldon,heated to precisely 183 degrees?
37752,Sheldon,is there too much pepper on your salad?
41110,Sheldon,it’s gonna get sucked in. it’s going to get sucked in.
36967,Sheldon,got it.
43036,Sheldon,"gary con, do we fly or drive? do we wear costumes? and if so, who gets to be gary?"
36930,Sheldon,"huh. seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? by the way, another accepted usage for the term ho."
43355,Sheldon,"oh, good. you’re here. i need your assistance."
43266,Sheldon,"perhaps howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing leonard."
34854,Sheldon,"ah, because it’s in long beach, and i don’t drive. "
36988,Sheldon,"that’s actually from my list, but leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it."
39672,Sheldon,i’m sorry. it’s the alcohol talking. go on.
40956,Sheldon,"uh, hello again. um, yeah, i don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it’s clear you young women here, today, have been. while i was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, i happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. uh, dr. rostenkowski, dr. fowler, are you there?"
40531,Sheldon,"not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products."
37969,Sheldon,"it’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. oh, lord, my belly!"
43031,Sheldon,it was a monday afternoon. you joined us for indian food.
45418,Sheldon,just roll the clip.  so tell us in your own words about that magical moment when fun with flags was born.
37166,Sheldon,"i sense that’s not sincere, although i have no idea why."
39810,Sheldon,"counter-proposal. we reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of mother’s day or father’s day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. we could call it leonard’s day."
36618,Sheldon,"okay, leonard, i know you’re concerned about disappointing me but i want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low."
41814,Sheldon,"it’s okay. you know, there, there’s always wondercon in anaheim, you know? that, that’s just as good. excuse me."
40598,Sheldon,"i can think of many things spider-man can’t do that a spider can. one, crawl in your ear and die. two, legally leave guatemala without a passport. three, have sex with a spider."
44751,Sheldon,"yeah, we could get thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress."
43427,Sheldon,"no, i’ll be okay. but i think that i’d like to send the ring back to you."
42755,Sheldon,"oh. oh, in that case, it was pretty good."
38671,Sheldon,how shall we begin?
39987,Sheldon,hello stuart.
41050,Sheldon,"wait. hold on. i believe screw it, i’m going in is what i said to your mother last night. don’t worry, i didn’t really say that. i find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting."
35734,Sheldon,what’s wrong with your tv?
37578,Sheldon,"a godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. i have to get my people to safety. people of sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. follow me. if the children can’t run, leave them behind. oh, the simulated horror!  raj? just as i suspected. meditation is nothing but hokum."
44499,Sheldon,"whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? okay, why, what’s wrong?"
45141,Sheldon,"i’m looking at the math, and i think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller."
43049,Sheldon,that was a lot of puppies.
42237,Sheldon,"an interesting question. well, good night."
45657,Sheldon,there. we’re outlaws.
41413,Sheldon,really?
40760,Sheldon,"a hush falls over the crowd as cooper studies the board. he makes his move. he’s dividing both sides by i. he’s adding back the coefficient. he has a value for p. he’s plugging that back in. he takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. the crowd goes wild. nobel! nobel!"
34257,Sheldon,no?
43531,Sheldon,"blue icees and a trip to the container store? it’s like i died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven."
21822,Sheldon,i don’t understand.
38420,Sheldon,hello.
43024,Sheldon,yes.
36401,Sheldon,even though the menu description specifies shredded?
45421,Sheldon,and that’s exactly what i did. i found a lot of someones. 
36004,Sheldon,there are boundaries.
42008,Sheldon,or what?
44576,Sheldon,i won’t be there.
44639,Sheldon,"you, too. oh, don’t forget. tuesday the air filters need to be changed."
40274,Sheldon,"shh, we’re trying to watch the movie. this is not working out with him."
39404,Sheldon,"mom, i want to apologize for my behaviour last night."
39645,Sheldon,don’t answer that. it’s a trick question. i speak from experience.
39119,Sheldon,"well, that’s it then. i’m dead."
36244,Sheldon,"here. i’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate."
36897,Sheldon,"no, no, i understand. anything happened to my mee-maw, i’d be one inconsolable moon pie. i should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie."
37054,Sheldon,are you sure? you look a bit puffy.
44777,Sheldon,"oh, wait, stop that."
42333,Sheldon,"yeah, i feel renewed. i’m ready to deal with any changes that come my way."
37725,Sheldon,"i told you, walking."
43554,Sheldon,"but i met with 11 people, and they all walked out. and that hollywood phoney chris pratt never tweeted me back."
43333,Sheldon,you remember my mother.
35502,Sheldon,"i must say, you’re playing very well for a woman of 23?"
38113,Sheldon,yes?
41826,Sheldon,"simple. earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. i googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. that’s where he’ll be, and that’s where i’m going, and…"
45576,Sheldon,that is true. she keeps asking how long amy’s going to be gone.
35327,Sheldon,forget! you want me to forget? this mind does not forget. i haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. it was a drizzly tuesday.
44551,Sheldon,hello.
38179,Sheldon,and you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?
42499,Sheldon,"yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!"
44330,Sheldon,"there’s a motion on the floor, i’m ridiculous. do we have a second? hmm? hmm? there is no second. the motion is denied. next time, make sure you have the votes first. that was embarrassing."
38997,Sheldon,i’m sorry. what pun?
45447,Sheldon,you and leonard don’t have anything in common. maybe you should break up.
36330,Sheldon,intriguing.
36700,Sheldon,"under the terms of my roommate agreement with leonard, i’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06."
40475,Sheldon,"amy, i can’t just ask wil wheaton to leave. he’s a minor celebrity. once you explain who he is, many people recognize him."
35550,Sheldon,a tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward earth and he exploded it with his mind.
34847,Sheldon,"she was going to see through your lie eventually, so i told her that you were lying to protect me. "
42110,Sheldon,"that’s actually not bad advice. you know, i didn’t seek out string theory. it just hit me over the head one day."
36471,Sheldon,i’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
43212,Sheldon,i know. this isn’t the printout. this is my real face.
35021,Sheldon,"poor choice. gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant. "
38046,Sheldon,robert oppenheimer was lonely.
40743,Sheldon,"well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence."
38138,Sheldon,are you ill?
37621,Sheldon,"remember, seven o’clock."
34916,Sheldon,we don’t have soup. 
35748,Sheldon,did you protest?
34823,Sheldon,it’s important.
37967,Sheldon,i have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. i’m nauseated and feverish. i believe i may have cholera.
37415,Sheldon,"yes, amusing. extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. i believe you know why i’m here in the laundry room."
45272,Sheldon,and what is that supposed to mean?
42205,Sheldon,i suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.
41207,Sheldon,"so, did you do that, or am i in the house with an intruder?"
41652,Sheldon,i’m in a great mood.
39648,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord. a man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the caped crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret."
36848,Sheldon,"doing what?  all right, you’ve made your point."
36919,Sheldon,"if you want to blend in with penny’s friends, i’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage."
40796,Sheldon,of course.
41700,Sheldon,"no, it’s not. i’ve seen things. lady things."
43616,Sheldon,it was pretty easy. and i think my background in mathletics helped. barry kripke was there. i should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
21830,Sheldon, leonard?leonard?
39114,Sheldon,my catapult flings my bishop to howard’s queen’s gorilla two.
37905,Sheldon,now.
38425,Sheldon,"73 is the 21st prime number. its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. eh? eh? did i lie?"
35725,Sheldon,"maybe when i publish it, i’ll include an inhaler."
44365,Sheldon,"well, bernadette, looks like saturday night, it’s you and me."
44147,Sheldon,"oh, that part wasn’t so bad. i didn’t like them, either. but then i’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends."
43734,Sheldon,on oatmeal day?
36110,Sheldon,that’s why it’s guarded by snakes. take some.
38182,Sheldon,"my apologies. good night, amy."
42696,Sheldon,"oh, i ordered it before your surgery. it’s the urn i was going to put you in."
43789,Sheldon,how many dates have you been on? who were they with? where’d you go? where did you meet them? did you sleep with them? and how much longer to the aquarium? i’m getting kind of hungry.
34936,Sheldon,"no. no, my mum had to fly back to texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again. "
44260,Sheldon,"really? ‘cause every time i come in here, i think less of me."
34975,Sheldon,"oh, god, now even you’re smarter than me."
38663,Sheldon,"so, when could we start?"
44314,Sheldon,"oh, uh, never have i ever thrown, caught or touched a frisbee."
37420,Sheldon,you will?
38670,Sheldon,"yes. in preparation for today’s studies, i read stanislavski’s an actor prepares, stella adler’s"
34445,Sheldon,"yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo."
37224,Sheldon,and don’t be chintzy with the shirley.
41200,Sheldon,"penny, we’re in the red zone. the white zone is for loading and unloading. we’re breaking the law."
37579,Sheldon,i question your premise. how is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
42068,Sheldon,but i haven’t decided yet.
44367,Sheldon,"oh, come on. roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, i’ve been avoiding these things all my life. and now, because you’re pregnant, you have to."
34874,Sheldon,"for your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile i wrote for you. "
40710,Sheldon,like what?
37260,Sheldon,the tv is gone.
45432,Sheldon,"oh great, see you at seven. "
42145,Sheldon,that’s a good question.  amy and bernadette. why did you lie to us?
39150,Sheldon,"will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?"
43662,Sheldon,space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
39617,Sheldon,"congratulations? the newcomb medal? oh, please. that’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework."
44675,Sheldon,i can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate.
40113,Sheldon,this is not my laundry.
42743,Sheldon,"yes, and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. maybe it’s time i teach her a lesson."
35372,Sheldon,i fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
44291,Sheldon,thanks.
41346,Sheldon,"well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? they might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams."
39125,Sheldon,i gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
35979,Sheldon,you put no thought into that.
41622,Sheldon,do you mind? we’re having a moment here.
42714,Sheldon,no. this is. stop looking at my legs.
36059,Sheldon,oh! i love trains!
45162,Sheldon,"no, thanks. i’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump."
43115,Sheldon,"fine. then grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side."
45280,Sheldon,all set.
35268,Sheldon,"no, no, that’s crazy. you go ahead and talk while i figure it out. "
35490,Sheldon,"i don’t know, but if you don’t figure something out, i warn you i shall become very difficult to live with."
42512,Sheldon,ow. we didn’t vote!
34454,Sheldon,"oh, i’m sorry, did i insult you? is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?"
36351,Sheldon,"no, i don’t drink coffee."
42985,Sheldon,"oh, that’s nonsense. i proclaimed my love for you. and the last time i looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis."
34620,Sheldon,thank you for the clarification. 
34393,Sheldon,"leonard, listen to me…"
35691,Sheldon,"yes, i am. it’s wednesday. wednesday’s halo night.</i>"
41144,Sheldon,"well, i’ve just never played dungeons & dragons with girls before."
44763,Sheldon,"so, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?"
35479,Sheldon,"of course it’s not, you’re only a level 25, the hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder."
44744,Sheldon,and welcome to the first on location episode of dr. sheldon cooper and dr. amy farrah fowler present…
41835,Sheldon,"oh, james, i could listen to your stories all night."
42558,Sheldon,my major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.
43156,Sheldon,aren’t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?
44114,Sheldon,hello.
35369,Sheldon,renaissance fair? more of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
42459,Sheldon,"and we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out."
34482,Sheldon,"well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby."
43992,Sheldon,"fine, if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip."
43087,Sheldon,squeaky wheel gets the grease?
43118,Sheldon,is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist i didn’t correct him?
37381,Sheldon,"actually, he might have to. there’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. the term was coined in 1976 by economist fred hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener."
34478,Sheldon,"i was working with luminous fish, and i thought, hey, loom! mom, what are you doing here?"
44480,Sheldon,mom.
38974,Sheldon,no.
41303,Sheldon,right.  penny. are you going to answer the door or should i open it and say aha again?
44927,Sheldon,are you sure? these items represent our shared times together.
40571,Sheldon,"morning, professor stevens. don’t look at that whiteboard. that’s my math, not your math. keep walking, nosey."
41097,Sheldon,"as professor proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin."
42840,Sheldon,who eats them horizontally?
44578,Sheldon,"oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them."
38835,Sheldon,the water level rose.
39284,Sheldon,"howard, i think i can help here. yes, bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks."
34279,Sheldon,hello.
39411,Sheldon,"all right, mom. when you’re at the ripley’s believe it or not museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true. "
43389,Sheldon,strongly disagree. go on.
41482,Sheldon,"let’s see, what’s next? okay, here. this is the magic marker i was using when i made the discovery."
35978,Sheldon,"no, we’re not. let’s say for a moment that i accept the bath item gift hypothesis, i now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?"
42405,Sheldon,did you enjoy my lecture?
36295,Sheldon,"when i signed for the package, i was deputized by the united parcel service and entrusted with its final delivery. i now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that i’m fully indemnified and no longer liable."
36107,Sheldon,"if you recall, i pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago."
43574,Sheldon,interesting. sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. and i would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
40213,Sheldon,"oh, dear. i was afraid of this."
44862,Sheldon,"yeh, why? eh, why? oh, that’s why."
43207,Sheldon,it reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. i hated that so much.
44723,Sheldon,"would you like one, mrs. petrescu?"
40960,Sheldon,"no, you really shouldn’t have. i brought my own."
34333,Sheldon,i helped run some cable for a webcam.
43685,Sheldon,how can you trust wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?
43264,Sheldon,"yeah, i never cared for that. it’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are."
43113,Sheldon,all he had was an idea.
37978,Sheldon,what about your pedometer?
42839,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, i was aiming for your heart."
35651,Sheldon,no. i quit. 
38480,Sheldon,that’s not correct. we were implying it. you then inferred it.
41326,Sheldon,you’re right. which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
38476,Sheldon,"yes, infinite sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because i made it at work."
42384,Sheldon,"okay. well, then, uh, first things first. um, are you familiar with the brachistochrone problem?"
39751,Sheldon,you’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. kudos.
39858,Sheldon,"this is preposterous. i think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, i’ll show you up."
40719,Sheldon,"and thanks to you, i know better than to ask if you’re menstruating. and based on your behaviour, i don’t have to."
37857,Sheldon,that’s not afternoon. that’s preevning.
35269,Sheldon,"a little crush? well i suppose so, in the same way menelaus had a little crush on helen of troy. "
37423,Sheldon,"all right, my friend. would you like some cholermus?"
45765,Sheldon,"and then the czech republic says to slovakia, i don’t think you understand how being broken up works. can you believe that? you’d think that the czech republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it’s not as young as it used to be. and i don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders."
35771,Sheldon,why?
44894,Sheldon,"i was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, i’d somehow be unburdened."
43838,Sheldon, amy?
35593,Sheldon,"oh, good. i’m not keeping you from anything. your check engine light is on."
35318,Sheldon,sure.  i’m batman. see.
38908,Sheldon,i thought i just did.
37455,Sheldon,"okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?"
39391,Sheldon,coffee.
44318,Sheldon,"oh, i haven’t asked it yet."
44497,Sheldon,"hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking."
37923,Sheldon,big night? the winter solstice is a big night. it’s over 14 hours in southern california.
45462,Sheldon,at the hands of those teenagers.
37089,Sheldon,"oh! how about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? he’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even though he’s not."
35795,Sheldon,well played.
43965,Sheldon,"penny, rub vicks on my chest."
39279,Sheldon,"wait. uh, which is closer to the new train store in monrovia, the movie theatre or the cheesecake factory?"
41706,Sheldon,to what?
42411,Sheldon,"at our committee meeting, amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but i tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon."
37150,Sheldon,oh!
43010,Sheldon,ha. keep dreaming.
43477,Sheldon,nothing odd. i just wanted to rub amy’s nose in it.
43556,Sheldon,"they didn’t used to be. you and leonard and penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. i was like the tin man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart."
42647,Sheldon,"i have to be honest with you leonard, i’m truly worried."
34302,Sheldon,"since it’s not bee season, you can have my epinephrine."
39397,Sheldon,"it is nice, isn’t it?"
36374,Sheldon,hello.
36035,Sheldon,"it’s a questionnaire i devised. i’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so i’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me."
36197,Sheldon,"that is my spot. in an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. if my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment i first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero."
44034,Sheldon,"stuart, now."
39941,Sheldon,i’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.
36171,Sheldon,my apologies. i’ve been living with your son too long. gotten into some bad habits.
43624,Sheldon,that kind of stinks? why aren’t you more upset? did i soften the blow too much? because this here is more like a picasso painting.
41369,Sheldon,"okay, another 30 feet."
45706,Sheldon,"if your video’s frozen, try resetting the tcp/ip stack."
39585,Sheldon,"the thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like stuart is repellent. no offence, stuart."
41873,Sheldon,in what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four? 
40451,Sheldon,how can it be okay? stephen hawking’s a genius and he talks like a robot. it’s everything i’ve ever wanted in a friend.
43571,Sheldon,"according to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. for all you know, i could be exercising right now."
34760,Sheldon,"leonard, please don’t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a nobel prize, is the day i begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets. "
36874,Sheldon,"thank you. you know, i can buy all these things online. i come here for the personal service."
43934,Sheldon,"ooh, perhaps it’s a heliosheath scintillation."
39080,Sheldon,good news. i finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
41089,Sheldon,yes.
40843,Sheldon,um…
43863,Sheldon,"i’ll, i’ll let you get back to sleep now. good night."
41079,Sheldon,let’s box it up.
43727,Sheldon,"yeah, right. you can just shut your feelings off. there goes television, lying to us again. we let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. leonard, how could i have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?"
39892,Sheldon,"oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. and for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam."
42288,Sheldon,no. i’ve reached my breaking point. i need to leave. now.
44104,Sheldon,"fine. if you insist on making me a part of this, yes, i knowledge how painful they can be. however, pain has an evolutionary purpose. it provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn’t good for us."
40846,Sheldon,great. kick him out. break his heart. everybody wins.
41024,Sheldon,"um… well… you are black, right?"
38798,Sheldon,"the audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?"
42408,Sheldon,"i missed a number of date nights while i was on my train trip, and i’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the relationship agreement."
38064,Sheldon,aw. what is she doing here?
39423,Sheldon,can i have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
39302,Sheldon,"gentlemen, please focus. you’re facing a fire-breathing dragon."
35884,Sheldon,it’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
43812,Sheldon,"good. oh, i watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so i’m gonna change my answer and eat spongebob."
40747,Sheldon,"leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. and look at us. at this moment, we are, in fact, a star trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. as long as we have those things, nothing can stop…"
37833,Sheldon,"yes. in 1917, when albert einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper zur quantentheorie der strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’."
37086,Sheldon,"however, on an unrelated topic, i am never getting out of this bed again."
39620,Sheldon,"technically, howard’s the gear head. leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey."
42328,Sheldon,amy just hurt my feelings. i want to break up with her.
42876,Sheldon,"hmm, perhaps. but i’m not taking the cap off."
37685,Sheldon,i’m hungry now.
21812,Sheldon,i can. i choose not to.
45751,Sheldon,"hey, guess who i am. beep bop boop bop. i’m you. get it?"
40889,Sheldon,really?
42505,Sheldon,"oh, this is already better. there are far fewer distractions in here."
41420,Sheldon,"hi. um, i’ve reconsidered. uh, you can’t work where i work. enjoy the rest of your evening."
39494,Sheldon,and that made you feel sad?
39817,Sheldon,"oh, no pressure. just get him a crummy card, you’re good."
40094,Sheldon,"okay, look, how about this? just give him my paper on the higgs boson. if he sees the incredible breakthrough i’ve made, he’ll reach out to me."
40040,Sheldon,is someone there?
38628,Sheldon,that’s not apropos. we’ve already established i’m found in the periodic table.
36229,Sheldon,"but once you open the box, you’ve voided the warranty. the warranty is a sacred covenant we’ve entered into with the manufacturer. he offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. this little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy."
37052,Sheldon,migraines?
40968,Sheldon,"howard, i have a few questions. i found three bowling pins. now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?"
36873,Sheldon,but i must have it.
44883,Sheldon,"bert? i wanted to let you know that i read your research, and your award is well-deserved."
37321,Sheldon,"captain hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. if you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight."
43011,Sheldon,when are we going to get robot eyes?
44546,Sheldon,i don’t understand why i can’t talk at this meeting.
36503,Sheldon,are you suggesting i sleep on the couch.
43260,Sheldon,"uh, building on that, we should order dinner."
41171,Sheldon,i erotically caress your  nose.
37055,Sheldon,when was your last menstrual period?
45578,Sheldon,she was part of the american team at cern.
38988,Sheldon,yes. why do you ask?
35655,Sheldon,"leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?"
37173,Sheldon,no trouble at all.
38782,Sheldon,i’m sorry. it’s not optional.
41568,Sheldon,okay.
36564,Sheldon,"you, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. that entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it."
38808,Sheldon,excuse me? isn’t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
34601,Sheldon,"or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. "
41405,Sheldon,yes. but not as good as i’m going to when i tell you that your precious garfield has no reason to hate mondays. he’s a cat. he doesn’t have a job.
42147,Sheldon,where are we going?
37711,Sheldon,"oh. hello, doggie. nice doggie. i bet you think you smell hot dogs. look, a cat!"
45319,Sheldon,"i was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and i realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the copenhagen interpretation."
38890,Sheldon,"what didn’t they get? they got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold."
37889,Sheldon,why on earth would we have sex?
42272,Sheldon,"no. here’s a thought. you’re not moving in, leonard’s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. and by the way, i saw you make this strawberry quik with syrup, you’re supposed to use the powder."
43912,Sheldon,"mm, that’s a great question. i like when they’re next to a chipotle."
40409,Sheldon,we seem to have different approaches here. i was going for helpful honesty. i have no idea what you’re doing.
43437,Sheldon,he does? who is it?
40394,Sheldon,"it’s fascinating. let me see if i can duplicate the result. howard, i’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. care to weigh in?"
39799,Sheldon,"before you go, consider this. not only do i have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, i also have all 61 episodes of the bbc series red dwarf and fiddle-faddle. all yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement."
38007,Sheldon,"you’re in luck, this is an easy one. in a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?"
45006,Sheldon,and what special circumstances are those?
34494,Sheldon,dr gablehouser.
35258,Sheldon,"show me your citrus peels. gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. show me your citrus peels. gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. show me your…"
37649,Sheldon,do you people even hear yourselves? it’s not the wesley crushers. it’s not the “wesley” crushers. it’s the wesley “crushers.”
35577,Sheldon,did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
42650,Sheldon,"remember when i said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?"
44604,Sheldon,"no, i can’t figure out the math. i’ve been racking my brain for days, and i’ve got nothing."
39447,Sheldon,be a lamb and check.
41605,Sheldon,"let me ask you a question. at any point, was las vegas on its side?"
45031,Sheldon,i don’t understand what’s wrong with socks.
40815,Sheldon,"there you go again, nag, nag, nag. you’re only proving my point, little lady."
43234,Sheldon,"all right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to earth nuts, but i’m the alien."
42866,Sheldon,i can do both. my brain is working at optimal capacity. i can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.
35051,Sheldon,"yes, well, i’m polymerised tree sap and you’re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you. "
41335,Sheldon,"and then leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the los angeles bureau of weights and measures. "
40748,Sheldon,i hate this planet.
39299,Sheldon,"seventeen. the ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. by the by, i liked it, too."
41857,Sheldon,"wow. i’m feeling the urge to hug you. and one, and two, all right, gollum, we’re good."
43587,Sheldon,"en garde, leonard. prepare yourself for a rigorous touching."
35665,Sheldon,"oh, yeah? well… you’re a mean person."
43833,Sheldon,they have beach right in the name. what do you think?
35024,Sheldon,he does. 
39374,Sheldon,"well, mom, if i did, it would be conclusive proof that your god can work miracles."
42034,Sheldon,here come the waterworks.
39239,Sheldon,i miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
38487,Sheldon,literally? literally a million years?
45364,Sheldon,"ah, i’m back, you got me for eight minutes."
38502,Sheldon,i’m sorry. but in what universe is wonder woman blonde?
38786,Sheldon,"we could. we could also stop using the letter m, but i think that idea is isguided and oronic."
35693,Sheldon,"me. sorry, leonard."
35115,Sheldon,"wow, i’m on fire tonight. "
40991,Sheldon,"yes, it’s six against one. stand down, sir."
42945,Sheldon,"i’m being petty? you know barry and i have a professional rivalry. you heard him, he told me to suck eggs. if we were friends, he would have suggested i suck something more pleasant. why are you laughing? did you learn something?"
45628,Sheldon,romulan.
35443,Sheldon,"you’re welcome. point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?"
44798,Sheldon,that’s my girl. what on earth? what is going on?
41192,Sheldon,you ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
39091,Sheldon,"sorry, i have company."
43319,Sheldon,"listen, leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. can you please keep the bible babble to yourself while she’s here?"
44256,Sheldon,"well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. you can still feel the dent. it’s right next to the hockey puck dent."
44460,Sheldon,"now, let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. and, and i realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. now, i ask you again. who here takes issue with this person…"
40284,Sheldon, leonard?
44924,Sheldon,thank you.
39974,Sheldon,"oh, relax. it was just her bottom and her breasts."
42595,Sheldon,"oh, this day just keeps getting better."
37815,Sheldon,"i don’t have to go to hell. at 73 degrees, i’m there already!"
37892,Sheldon,you mean dating?
35798,Sheldon,how is deep space nine better than saturn 3?
38970,Sheldon,"that’s all. i’ve just been thinking about it. now, i’m thinking about fractal equations. now i’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. now i’m thinking about trains."
37139,Sheldon,"no, fig newtons are named after a small town in massachusetts. don’t write that down!"
36033,Sheldon,first warning.
40684,Sheldon,"i need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. uh, to protect those involved, i’ll be changing their names."
36012,Sheldon,"no, leonard. for years, merciless thugs like kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named indian burns. that stops now."
44619,Sheldon,"historically, i don’t do well with change."
39676,Sheldon,"it’s appreciated. and if you ever manage to find a woman again, i’ll be glad to return the favour."
44986,Sheldon,"raj, show some compassion. those are things that we think but don’t say."
35152,Sheldon,i’m not ignoring my sister. i’m ignoring all of you. 
42065,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll try."
36337,Sheldon,– what’s wrong with it?
34663,Sheldon,"oh, terrific, now we’re running a cute little b&b."
39516,Sheldon,"good idea. attention is what birds want.  make a pot of tea, leonard. it’s going to be a long night."
41134,Sheldon,"i’ve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. hello, new dice smell."
35098,Sheldon,no. 
35246,Sheldon,why?
44535,Sheldon,"okay, howard’s on board. what do you think, leonard?"
42624,Sheldon,it’s not just that. leonard and penny also made comments about it. and i’m not blind. even i looked twice when i saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
37196,Sheldon,why is leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
45515,Sheldon,"you’re so kind. you know, i don’t know how i ever got by without you."
36130,Sheldon,no.
37300,Sheldon,good thinking. perhaps i’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
35209,Sheldon,"possibly, but unverified."
37570,Sheldon,"sim city. more specifically, the sim city i designed, sheldonopolis."
42958,Sheldon,can i think about the spiny anteater?
37529,Sheldon,never.
44739,Sheldon,hmm?
40223,Sheldon,"whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same."
38819,Sheldon,possibly. i tweeted him.
40125,Sheldon,what do you want me to do?
43804,Sheldon,"i know. it makes its own gravy, it’ll slide right down."
35627,Sheldon,"i just don’t see why i need a driver’s license, albert einstein never had a driver’s license."
37223,Sheldon,"they don’t? well, apparently, these people and i differ greatly on the definition of party."
42523,Sheldon,perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.
38914,Sheldon,the name and the address drip with evil.
41704,Sheldon,"of course i’m doing laundry. saturday night is laundry night, and i’m in a laundry room, so, i believe your inference is justified."
35768,Sheldon,"all right, that’s it. strike three."
44063,Sheldon,yeah.
37970,Sheldon,"i haven’t. i’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?"
39087,Sheldon,"and a third person. it’s three-person chess. i must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. you should reflect on that."
38679,Sheldon,"hey, you taught me something. who would have thought it?"
37245,Sheldon,hulk sad.
36956,Sheldon,"it’s called scientists. now, i will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. to make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. for example, abu musa jabir ibn hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than halbert vanderplatt made to neurobiology. okay, ready to have some fun?"
44547,Sheldon,okay. quick question. am i allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?
36571,Sheldon,"i’m on the horns of a dilemma. can you imagine me, sheldon cooper, at the north pole?"
40464,Sheldon,"oh, i love brain teasers."
35325,Sheldon,why don’t you take a minute to decide  i can’t keep your secret penny. i’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. like a renaissance triptych. like a cheap suit.
35091,Sheldon,"for what it’s worth, i thought it was humorous. "
42497,Sheldon,is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
41409,Sheldon,"that makes two of us. my new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. come on, one."
45269,Sheldon,what about his dog?
37105,Sheldon,"oh, sure. and while we’re at it, why don’t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?"
41849,Sheldon,"ah, the worst for last. hmm. classic flakey."
37098,Sheldon,"i made a boo-boo, all right?"
42545,Sheldon,"where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine."
45573,Sheldon,"i was scared, but i told myself it’s just a big bathtub. then i got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub."
43668,Sheldon,"leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught."
45107,Sheldon,"aw. somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right. "
40454,Sheldon,i can’t. losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.
38479,Sheldon,"oh, that’s easy enough. we’d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty."
40234,Sheldon,"oh, i’m glad you like it. raj picked it out."
39995,Sheldon,"yeah, i always thought if i were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from glendale."
43348,Sheldon,i know. do you think i should start watching the flash tv show?
34956,Sheldon,"assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. you would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another."
45225,Sheldon,"well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. you couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping."
41013,Sheldon,"well put. you know, i must say i go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running."
45300,Sheldon,"no, i can’t take all the credit. i spoke with leonard’s mother, and she made me feel better."
39901,Sheldon,"oh, it’s very simple. scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons spock, spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves spock, spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
41621,Sheldon,all right.
21843,Sheldon,yes.
42222,Sheldon,i know.
45346,Sheldon,what if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress?
45801,Sheldon,i can’t get out of bed. i hurt my ankle.
44102,Sheldon,"well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. the flag of the isle of man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems."
43112,Sheldon,"oh. that’s just as well. they had me on hold for 20 minutes and i hung up.  leonard? also, wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so i’m ready whenever you are."
43527,Sheldon,what an innovative solution. perhaps i don’t give your mit education enough credit.
38051,Sheldon,a group of cats is a clowder. or a glaring.
40576,Sheldon,"your threats are empty, nothing can move me.  stop that."
42553,Sheldon,this is a simulation. we have to survive on the supplies we brought.
40048,Sheldon,"oh, of course. set phasers to dumb, right?  it’s only logical."
44500,Sheldon,"oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?"
40798,Sheldon,"well, word around the university is i’m giving her sex organs a proper jostling."
44348,Sheldon,she did.
42712,Sheldon,"fancy a dip, my dear?"
39493,Sheldon,"if you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted."
35760,Sheldon,"yes, baseball."
39195,Sheldon,what are you doing here?
44003,Sheldon,challenge accepted. sounds like it’s time for the sheldon cooper apology tour.
40608,Sheldon,"oh, no, i see the confusion. no, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when i’m ill. when you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny."
36448,Sheldon,"oh, good, stuart, i thought i heard your voice. do you have a moment?"
36552,Sheldon,"i must say, howard, i think a detailed letter to mit describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree."
35896,Sheldon,"so, that’s all you’ve got? apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?"
35796,Sheldon,just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
39914,Sheldon,yeah. call first. 
38221,Sheldon,and is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
44008,Sheldon,"all you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior."
44818,Sheldon,you tricked me. you didn’t say one.
44615,Sheldon,"if you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that’s how you do it."
44421,Sheldon,she can cover it in a car ride? i could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.
36842,Sheldon,you’re defacing my work.
45160,Sheldon,"leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. so much is unprovable. but when i was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. then it clacked. then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. whoo-whoo."
45111,Sheldon,"hey, leonard, if you’re happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because i have an emotion detector."
41832,Sheldon,"is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?"
43972,Sheldon,"i never did get that chicken noodle, did i?"
40364,Sheldon,"hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it."
35783,Sheldon,"when you understand the laws of physics, penny, anything is possible. and may i add, mwah-ha-ha!"
44663,Sheldon,how? you had the whole floor to yourself.
43466,Sheldon,"you must be thinking about donny and marie, ’cause you and i are clearly talking about sonny and cher."
36305,Sheldon,how many of these can you make a day?
38307,Sheldon,but why should that keep me up?
37230,Sheldon,"when i lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree."
42537,Sheldon,"all right, amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. if we run into any problems, i’ll contact you. and if anything bad happens, what’s the rule?"
41527,Sheldon,"yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk."
38162,Sheldon,"leonard, i’m a physicist, not a hippie."
40428,Sheldon,"amy. why would you give me a word? now, if i play extract it would be cheating."
35788,Sheldon,"i had no choice, leonard, she ruined laundry night."
38049,Sheldon,about what?
40014,Sheldon,"oh, good. hah-hah!"
35219,Sheldon,is it the geometry that makes it fun.
36610,Sheldon,"here, drink slash eat this."
37244,Sheldon,hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
45091,Sheldon,yeah.
45222,Sheldon,uh-huh. interesting. okay.
38984,Sheldon,"look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. you’re a vixen, amy farrah fowler."
45262,Sheldon,what? can’t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?
43520,Sheldon,"ooh, the green lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it."
42662,Sheldon,"well, thank you. and leonard never lets me have french toast sticks in the car. i can’t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl."
36225,Sheldon,"i’m sorry, leonard. but revenge is a dish best served cold."
40972,Sheldon,"wait, can i bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?"
40281,Sheldon,"leonard, the transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. you know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. or a conversation about the transformers might actually be about someone in this room. i’m going to pause to let that sink in."
43950,Sheldon,i haven’t settled on anything yet.
41234,Sheldon,isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?
45711,Sheldon,"bazinga, punk. now we’re even."
44956,Sheldon,a functional mri of my brain. i did sudoku before they took it so i’d be ripped.
35801,Sheldon,"it’s very simple. look, scissors cuts paper. paper covers rock. rock crushes lizard. lizard poisons spock. spock smashes scissors. scissors decapitates lizard. lizard eats paper. paper disproves spock. spock vaporizes rock. and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
36028,Sheldon,"hey it’s true, kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that i need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe."
37130,Sheldon,how else are you gonna study for the tests?
35871,Sheldon,"to help. look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed."
42611,Sheldon,"what, are you sure? it’s my first prom, i want to do it correctly."
42792,Sheldon,all the time.
43953,Sheldon,"i like it. yeah, we’ll take the a-m from amy and, uh, the y from emily."
38856,Sheldon,"well, i don’t care how you did it. i have more important things to think about. clearly, the cards are marked."
34932,Sheldon,you’re going to leave me? 
38829,Sheldon,of course. barry?
39465,Sheldon,"it just occurred to me that i never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. so i hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. put ‘er there, you old so-and-so."
42494,Sheldon,"if we could figure out the scientific basis for marty’s hover board, that would have universal application."
41584,Sheldon,"the more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?"
40053,Sheldon,"why? i got away with it. leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. and i have a toy that isn’t broken. everybody’s happy."
39363,Sheldon,i don’t care.
37723,Sheldon,you can’t cook and you made me this.
36788,Sheldon,"well, i’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. i trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum."
35542,Sheldon,"oh, sorry. "
37243,Sheldon,"oh, my. i’ve admired these for years."
43720,Sheldon,"because when i speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that i’ve put this amy nonsense behind me."
37119,Sheldon,"can’t you surprise him in some other way? for example, i’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment."
36432,Sheldon,why would i gamble? it’s mine. let go.
35914,Sheldon,"she’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated."
41956,Sheldon,"oh, i’m fine. it’s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. there’s the remote yet distinct possibility that i may end up in south america."
42242,Sheldon,"well, now do you see the problem?"
35729,Sheldon,"more pad thai, please."
42280,Sheldon,"no. i do not accept this. everything is changing and i hate it. it stops now. i’m helping you get back on your feet. i would like to purchase this comic book, please."
39690,Sheldon,"you’re right, the tiara was too much."
44853,Sheldon,"oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under."
34624,Sheldon,"oh, what fresh hell is this?"
42273,Sheldon,no. the syrup tastes better and i don’t like it.
36409,Sheldon,you got the wrong mustard.
34476,Sheldon,"that’s just the beginning. i also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. oh, glow in the dark tampons! leonard, we’re going to be rich. "
44896,Sheldon,"we, hang on, you’re my enemy. now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. and right now, i’m my own worst enemy. that makes you my friend. okay, i’m good to go."
42053,Sheldon,bernadette?
34810,Sheldon,artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes. 
36411,Sheldon,"oh, great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed."
41701,Sheldon,doesn’t matter. this is no way to make new humans. people coming out of people. it’s some kind of dirty magic show.
42846,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. i’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. from now on, when i make an assertion, i need you to challenge it."
37732,Sheldon,maybe this isn’t a good time.
41687,Sheldon,texas.
43073,Sheldon,okay. does that planet have to be earth?
36201,Sheldon,they don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
43349,Sheldon,"well, one of the things."
41647,Sheldon,i do see what you’re saying. that helps.
41415,Sheldon,"not as relieved as i’m about to be. it’s a brave new world, little lady."
39155,Sheldon,"zandor, wizard of the north. ha! i win."
34390,Sheldon,"oh, i’ve seen that look before. this is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. i don’t know if i can take it. "
41028,Sheldon,"first of all, when you say things like that, people think you’re crazy. second, the reason i’m cancelling is because i have to attend a memorial service for professor tupperman."
39537,Sheldon,every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. i’m not going to be another statistic.
36470,Sheldon,"you know, i’m given to understand that there is an entire city in nevada designed specifically to help people like howard forget their problems. where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases."
40613,Sheldon,"i’m sorry. i just want you to get better as soon as possible. and with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. do you believe in the placebo effect?"
35108,Sheldon,"you can’t. if you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. this is a classic rookie time travel mistake. "
44242,Sheldon,can we please change the subject?
36823,Sheldon,"so, that’s what you wear to an interview?"
44660,Sheldon,who are you calling? aaargh!
39854,Sheldon,you know what this place needs? a suggestion box.
36532,Sheldon,"we don’t know. and if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know."
42797,Sheldon,"i wasn’t done, but go ahead. he said, compromising."
40260,Sheldon,"well, it’s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s raisinets."
35385,Sheldon,"well then, no problem, i have three controllers, the more the merrier."
42209,Sheldon,but i do appreciate them.
38749,Sheldon,no. but thank you for asking.
35826,Sheldon,so you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?
41872,Sheldon,what?
44122,Sheldon,all get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?
37564,Sheldon,"no. the x-men were named for the x in charles xavier. since i am sheldon cooper, you will be my c-men."
45400,Sheldon,"uh, no, thank you. we now know why mastercard sent me a fraud alert."
37638,Sheldon,no. clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
41133,Sheldon,dungeons & dragons.
45165,Sheldon,"well, first of all, you can’t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation."
45256,Sheldon,"when the irs questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight."
44669,Sheldon,"well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started."
45560,Sheldon,"gentlemen. you may remember dr. nowitzki, she’s back at caltech for her postdoc."
42184,Sheldon,"amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time."
38086,Sheldon,"oh, lord, will this day never end? as i’ve explained repeatedly to dr. koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the american idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture."
43237,Sheldon,any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. so the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.
40074,Sheldon,"oh, okay, let me see this. all right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. now, i was thinking… howard, you go ahead and eat. this isn’t going to make any sense to you."
44268,Sheldon,i will always have the dent to remember it by.
36077,Sheldon,not really. i feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote.
37946,Sheldon,"my family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera."
44874,Sheldon,"yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you."
38215,Sheldon,i’ll have the chicken noodle. goodnight.
42926,Sheldon,i’m done hiding from bullies. i’m taking this into the real world.
43535,Sheldon,"no, i thought we were friends. you asked for a sip of my icee. if you had your own straw, i might’ve said yes."
44434,Sheldon,hey. is everything smoothed out with amy?
42655,Sheldon,"you don’t, but the surgeon might, hmm? and your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at disneyland."
41964,Sheldon,"oh, very much so."
36710,Sheldon,help me open it.
39151,Sheldon,"this might be a good time to point out, howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. hold the door!"
36954,Sheldon,"look on the bright side. as the result of penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of research lab. would you like a commemorative snow cone?"
42610,Sheldon,"his name is alfred, and, yes, he does."
35453,Sheldon,"afk. i’m playing age of conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of robert e. howard’s conan the barbarian."
40633,Sheldon,maybe i will.
39430,Sheldon,get out!
41218,Sheldon,"everything i say is true. now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace."
35011,Sheldon,"hey, howard. you’re a jew. if there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? okay, it’s definitely me. "
39100,Sheldon,it’s not optional. we’re out of tea. i hope you like bouillon.
35806,Sheldon,what happened?
38564,Sheldon,"they are pants one wears over one’s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. but perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you’ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man."
34464,Sheldon,that was fun. maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores. 
34695,Sheldon,"i can’t shoot now, i’m cloaking."
42896,Sheldon,"for a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump."
42809,Sheldon,how about one night and i let you whistle?
41765,Sheldon,"you work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get."
42574,Sheldon,making the extra effort. good for you.
38968,Sheldon,"mm, it’s hard to say. i can only speculate based on the data i collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. in that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. oop! out of arrows."
41318,Sheldon,"all right, i’ll give you that one."
44296,Sheldon,"oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm."
38632,Sheldon,please tell me you’re not having coitus.
36179,Sheldon,"i was hesitant the first time i tried it, but i experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. it’s quite satisfying."
34732,Sheldon,a beloved character from an indian folk tale. 
43308,Sheldon,"it is awful, isn’t it? listen to that noise."
38471,Sheldon,"go, amy farrah fowler. follow your endocrine system."
40860,Sheldon,you did.
36438,Sheldon,"look at that, that’s a dent. thank you, howard ham-fisted wolowitz. did you just shut the tv off in the middle of the classic deep space nine/star trek the original series trouble with tribbles crossover episode?"
43519,Sheldon,"everybody hold on. let’s take this problem one step at a time. first, we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. and the sooner we decide it’s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work."
35901,Sheldon,"i’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. which brings me back to my question, where are you in . clearly, i’m 14 days too early."
36716,Sheldon,his name isn’t toby. toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
43316,Sheldon,"oh, thank you, mother."
42433,Sheldon,or a one. a one is possible.
35445,Sheldon,"well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they’re almost pure protein."
44865,Sheldon,that’s a good idea. i guess everyone’s having them now.
21848,Sheldon,"they don’t get a vote. it’s one against one. and according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me."
39491,Sheldon,would you like to talk about it? and keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
44796,Sheldon,i’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
44984,Sheldon,"but if my mom asks, we have bunk beds."
34906,Sheldon,"oh, dear god.  leonard! leonard, i’m sick!"
37425,Sheldon,"oh, but i am. didn’t penny tell you the good news?"
42949,Sheldon,no. she helped barry kripke make an advancement in string theory.
42767,Sheldon,"well, then it’s settled."
40049,Sheldon,oh dear. two suns and no sunscreen.
38432,Sheldon,all right. what were the symptoms?
44048,Sheldon,"oh. you got even smaller. i love it. uh, meemaw, this is leonard. leonard, this is my meemaw."
35735,Sheldon,"excuse me, penny, but we’re…"
42161,Sheldon,oh. that’s a lot of incense. or someone set a hippie on fire.
40465,Sheldon,"hello, i’m dr. sheldon cooper. welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags. before we get started, i’d like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. but i can’t. the only entry was from gameygamer75, and i know that was a jpeg of your buttocks. now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, star trek. and to help me, i’m pleased to introduce internet personality, former star of star trek: the next generation, and the only guy i know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. set phasers to fun for my friend, wil wheaton."
34295,Sheldon,that was a valid hypothesis? what is happening to you?
43658,Sheldon,"let me give you an example. earlier today, i decoded the headers on your e-mail, and i know that your name is kenneth fitzgerald. from that, i figured out where you live and where you work. now, to make this a mexican standoff, i would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or i’ll turn you in to the authorities."
39511,Sheldon,"shoo, shoo! be gone!"
35807,Sheldon,"defcon 5? well, there’s no need to rush."
39314,Sheldon,"yeah, i actually have information about raj that would be helpful with this discussion."
42342,Sheldon,"i’m sensing awkwardness, am i right?"
44491,Sheldon,leonard? leonard?
40463,Sheldon,"yes, congratulations. you won fair and square. uh, very impressive, sir."
39557,Sheldon,"flaming spittoon. and for the record, i’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. we’re playing our inaugural round of wild west and witches, and i’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  patooie."
36135,Sheldon,"in case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that i’ve moved my money out of the snake can."
41387,Sheldon,"oh, it turns out amy’s beloved pride and prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. he’s got too much pride, she’s got too much prejudice, it just works."
40975,Sheldon,"oh, hello. what can i do for you ladies?"
37231,Sheldon,it’s a limited edition green lantern lantern. my friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
45383,Sheldon,home from work? what time is it?
34865,Sheldon,"it’s a very nice community. the queen mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner. "
39534,Sheldon,"oh, come now. your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class."
37776,Sheldon,hello.
34280,Sheldon,"okay, thanks for your time."
45423,Sheldon,"hello, bert. what is your flag-related comment or query?"
37449,Sheldon,"undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. from left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of pasadena."
44062,Sheldon,"how could it? i never told you, and you never bothered to ask."
42024,Sheldon,"well, this is confusing for me. but i don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. so, i’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance."
34307,Sheldon,"you’re kidding, right?"
36065,Sheldon,we were really hitting it off.
21817,Sheldon,this isn’t going to work if you’re guessing. when do you evacuate your bowels?
37848,Sheldon,"as a native texan, i must say i’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context."
45781,Sheldon,"amy, quick, lock the door."
43683,Sheldon,that’s preposterous.
41109,Sheldon,"oh, no. how could anybody hate gino the neutrino? it’s nice, huh? i got him for 20 bucks on ebay. including the shipping!"
42031,Sheldon,i can’t.
36512,Sheldon,sing soft kitty.
34595,Sheldon,i’m the doppler effect. 
40201,Sheldon,"i’m in hell, leonard. don’t stop."
42913,Sheldon,"well, i’m responding to it."
40147,Sheldon,"clever, but also wrong. no, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. that way, you’d be human, fungus, and algae. triple threat. like three-bean salad."
45503,Sheldon,this is disconcerting. 
42530,Sheldon,"so it’s settled, we’re not doing it."
39262,Sheldon, penny.
41333,Sheldon,or a mutant army. it depends on how my kickstarter goes.
34552,Sheldon,who do i speak to about permanently reserving this table? 
36528,Sheldon,"excuse me, stuart. have you read the new flash?"
35848,Sheldon,"oh, good, i used that right. anyway, you’re aware that leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?"
41212,Sheldon,"um, well, i was worried that you might be missing leonard. and that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched clash of the titans right before you went to bed."
44372,Sheldon,i am going to record this for posterity.
43966,Sheldon,"oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me."
40210,Sheldon,"i’ll do it, provided i can perform the ceremony in klingon."
40304,Sheldon,"all right then, so we’re all on the same page. yes."
45436,Sheldon,you made me sit on the stairs and think about what i did.
44640,Sheldon,"oh. oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit."
44414,Sheldon,taylor swift.
39633,Sheldon,yes.
43027,Sheldon,"well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a formula one race car. so i’m just concentrating on that. plus, it’s easier around people that i’m comfortable with."
39657,Sheldon,"ooh! speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 twitter followers."
39328,Sheldon,okay? it’s magnificent.
44583,Sheldon,"gentlemen, i am ready to work. to quote the martian, let’s science the faeces out of this. that’s the martian the book and the martian the movie, not marvin the martian. although to quote marvin the martian, i claim this planet in the name of mars."
36743,Sheldon,"leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. i lost a bet to wolowitz."
43347,Sheldon,i taught her that.
35739,Sheldon,"oh! worf, nice! too bad that’s a proper noun."
40350,Sheldon,"well, i don’t sell my friendship that cheaply."
21824,Sheldon,your room. you may want to repaint. 
38839,Sheldon,"when he finished, he shouted eureka!"
37972,Sheldon,i do. and yet i’m doomed while you live on.
37751,Sheldon,do you have allergies?
42230,Sheldon,"oh, quite all right. after my forehead melanoma scare i’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. well, sorry, i don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea."
35270,Sheldon,well menelaus was the brother of agamemnon…
38583,Sheldon,yes. and they’re still sticky.
35459,Sheldon,"just click on them. congratulations, you are now a level three warrior."
38140,Sheldon,i want you to know that i’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.
34990,Sheldon,"if you’re concerned about sharing credit with me, you’re name can go first… i’m going. "
41528,Sheldon,that’s even worse. using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. pervert.
36673,Sheldon,"aw, mom."
45756,Sheldon,can you keep it down? some of us are trying to sleep out here.
44880,Sheldon,"well, it’s a new day. i have a new outlook. you know, i realized i don’t need to worry about other people. i just need to think more about myself."
41968,Sheldon,i have to go to the bathroom.
42725,Sheldon,it’s not the same thing. i don’t think you know how i feel at all.
35252,Sheldon,i’m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
40823,Sheldon,dobby the elf dies in book seven.
45812,Sheldon,he’s a lamb. you’re not.
44514,Sheldon,but why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
45606,Sheldon,what’s happening.
37463,Sheldon,are you saying that you will not stand beside me as i plead my case?
44251,Sheldon,just wait.
38668,Sheldon, penny.
41834,Sheldon,oh. is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?
40770,Sheldon,"and yet, now you’re in my office. point, cooper. welcome to the thunderdome, kripke."
35920,Sheldon,"if i am permitted to speak again, dr. sheldon cooper for the win."
43639,Sheldon,that’s right. and what did he do?
39788,Sheldon,"oh, i’m so sorry for your loss. on a cheerier note, i have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. what do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?"
40615,Sheldon,"how can you sleep? i’m not done making you feel better. i still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply vaporub to your chest."
34941,Sheldon,wait. will you please rub this on my chest. 
39710,Sheldon,really? i didn’t see you in there.
42473,Sheldon,"well, i guess it was too good to be true."
44333,Sheldon,are you up-to-date on game of thrones?
34566,Sheldon,"tv , film, d&d, manga, greek gods, roman gods, norse gods…"
41111,Sheldon,yes.
37989,Sheldon,"if it makes you feel any better, thursday is no longer cruciferous vegetable night."
40958,Sheldon,heard you the first time.
43881,Sheldon,"i suppose you’re here because i’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and i’ve never done that before."
35652,Sheldon,"remind me to compliment wolowitz on the software, it’s amazingly detailed."
38313,Sheldon,yes.
45651,Sheldon,"i have a bone to pick with you, sir."
36623,Sheldon,"all right. well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave."
36612,Sheldon,"because in the frigid temperatures in the arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight."
44413,Sheldon,yes.
34777,Sheldon,it’s certainly preferable to my plan.
38845,Sheldon,thank you.
37122,Sheldon,the one with the frogs.
45004,Sheldon,"all right. this is on you. amy and i are living together in sin, like a couple of new yorkers. now, while you scold us, i’m going to get a knife and a fork. joe may be sloppy, but sheldon’s not."
41005,Sheldon,"if i could keep my gmail account, i’d be okay with that."
35017,Sheldon,"by that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the olympic bobsled competition."
37335,Sheldon,"i don’t know, two, three days. not important. i don’t need sleep, i need answers. i need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth."
35292,Sheldon,schrodinger’s cat.
39605,Sheldon,is this the fellow who peed in your hawaiian punch?
38082,Sheldon,hello. i see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
34521,Sheldon,so you’re saying leonard has a girl in there.
35996,Sheldon,what did the toaster oven ever do to you?
45710,Sheldon,i need a tissue.this one got wet.
37373,Sheldon,"you’re right. that is more menial. hello, i’m sheldon. i’ll be your server today. i don’t recommend the salmon. i saw it in the kitchen."
34530,Sheldon,"of course i’m sure. look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign’s been changed. "
40670,Sheldon,"well, then, you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots."
45061,Sheldon,yes.
41542,Sheldon,"it’s because i’m annoying, right? i know it is. say it. say it. say i’m annoying. "
36354,Sheldon,"you’re right, of course."
34646,Sheldon,"well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit."
40414,Sheldon,what’s a hickey?
34953,Sheldon,"can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus."
34642,Sheldon,"it’s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it. "
43907,Sheldon,"arthur. what are you doing here? i, i don’t think i need any more advice."
34414,Sheldon,what should i tell her.
38944,Sheldon,it’d be swell if they had a train.
43296,Sheldon,"well, don’t worry. he went to mit. he can solve any problem, as long as it doesn’t originate in a russian man’s colon."
41178,Sheldon,great. i’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
42613,Sheldon,"yes. i’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch."
39376,Sheldon,"the lord giveth and the lord bloweth away. well, mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken."
45382,Sheldon,what’s going on? how’d i get here?
36820,Sheldon,i reject them all.
35260,Sheldon,why me? why not koothrappali or wolowitz?
40693,Sheldon,"talk to her? that’s all you’ve got? with a cool name like sheldon cooper’s council of ladies, i really expected more. give me back the t-shirts."
37478,Sheldon,"and yet you wound up in traffic court. anyway, if it would please the court, i’d like to begin with an opening statement."
39595,Sheldon,feel free to retain a lawyer.
39559,Sheldon,did it look ridiculous when we got the satanimals pack and i dressed up as a beelzebobcat?
35712,Sheldon,"never, that’s the problem. i need your help."
45339,Sheldon,can you stop breathing so loud? i can hear your nose whistling.
34845,Sheldon,hungry? tired? i’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit. 
42087,Sheldon,i don’t know if i can do that.
34978,Sheldon,"well of course you don’t, you’ve never excelled at anything. "
40137,Sheldon,"professor hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir."
43098,Sheldon,"no. no, they loved it. they, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it."
37091,Sheldon,"mountain dew. ah, refreshing. now, we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen."
35354,Sheldon,"hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud. "
36761,Sheldon,you can catch even more flies with manure. what’s your point?
42148,Sheldon,"okay. ‘cause if i had to pick now, i’d probably go with dark matter because…"
35642,Sheldon,ooh!
39615,Sheldon,"oh, now perlmutter’s shaking the king’s hand. yeah, check for your watch, gustaf. he might have lifted it."
41962,Sheldon,"it is. you were wrong, friend howard. she completely understood."
34590,Sheldon,"alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors i’m much more suited to being the guy from the faa, analysing wreckage. "
42569,Sheldon,"no, thank you. delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. it’s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. i’d shake your hand, but, well, you know."
37532,Sheldon,waterfalls!
40539,Sheldon,"sorry? you may not realize it, but i have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. you know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as i want to. it’s exhausting. which is why, for twenty minutes a day, i like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what i need to do to recharge."
36200,Sheldon,koothrappali picked me up.
39139,Sheldon,"to a hospital? full of sick people? oh, i don’t think so."
42364,Sheldon,"oh, yes. fig newtons. i was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? and then after someone said newton, i was going to tell them they’re wrong. the cookies are named after a town in massachusetts. and then i’d throw the cookies away."
38821,Sheldon,leonard.
35297,Sheldon,"please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement. "
44273,Sheldon,"you look amazing. i mean, this resolution is remarkable."
38416,Sheldon,"oh, there you are. just so you know, i was up all night, but i have finally completed the penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement."
43334,Sheldon,"oh, no, not at all. no, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits."
42030,Sheldon,seriously. i feel like i’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.
42824,Sheldon, penny?
40903,Sheldon,right. and which one do i want?
37659,Sheldon,excuse me. i don’t know who you’re chanting for as i am currently the ball.
36108,Sheldon,"you know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money."
36293,Sheldon,excuse me.
40293,Sheldon,did you know that leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? hubba-hubba.
37109,Sheldon,howard?
42741,Sheldon,"oh, we’re not exchanging gifts."
42692,Sheldon,"wow. i don’t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. well, i’m done speaking to you."
40170,Sheldon,"ah, much better."
35697,Sheldon,he does want that. does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
38469,Sheldon,little comfort tonight. i look like a hell’s angel.
40795,Sheldon,"because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. anyway, if kripke asks, tell him my coitus with amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive."
36454,Sheldon,has to be? has to be? i hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
43211,Sheldon,"yes, oh, but enter through the side. batman is a load-bearing blanket."
40245,Sheldon,"all right. please. amy, when i look in your eyes and you’re looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because i feel stronger and weaker at the same time. i feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. the truth is, i don’t know what i feel, except i know what kind of man i want to be."
45678,Sheldon,"oh, penny, thank you!"
44925,Sheldon,"oh, now, what about our 3-d chess set?"
42431,Sheldon,"why? we won. you know, i say, next, we take on koothrappali and his dog. really give ourselves a challenge."
37092,Sheldon,"yes, exactly."
45211,Sheldon,"no, they’re private."
39222,Sheldon,no. jamba juice is for heroes. and that’s what we’re going to be.
37134,Sheldon,this is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient greeks through isaac newton to niels bohr to erwin schrodinger to the dutch researchers that leonard is currently ripping off.
42954,Sheldon,"is that all you have? shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? gee, penny, life’s giving me lemons. what should i do?"
44542,Sheldon,that’s what you said.
44923,Sheldon,i’ll be right across the hall. you’ll probably be able to hear it.
45385,Sheldon,"well, i remember waking up in the morning, amy rubbing vicks on my chest. and her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. i took some cold medicine to… i took cold medicine."
44298,Sheldon,"ah, it’s basic thermodynamics. i’m sure we can figure that out."
44513,Sheldon,"yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. pretty efficient, huh?"
36671,Sheldon,"oh, you think you’re so clever. well, let me just tell you, while i do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy."
34338,Sheldon,sssshhhh! penny’s sleeping.
42914,Sheldon,"look, i am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. and failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers."
42946,Sheldon,hello.
45321,Sheldon,"yeah, and this one won’t stain my teeth purple."
45028,Sheldon,how did we get in the car?
40989,Sheldon,my shirt is itchy and i wish i were dead.
39064,Sheldon,"unless leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in india saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff leonard hofstadter."
44934,Sheldon,"come along, amy. i know when i’m not wanted."
45404,Sheldon,i swear.
43799,Sheldon,"well, my game is better, ’cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them."
41721,Sheldon,or instead of me.
39456,Sheldon,"all right. so the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. probably won’t be relying on seuss here. although one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish might be surprisingly applicable. go on."
43642,Sheldon,"leonard, wait. this is highly unethical."
44189,Sheldon,"well, that’s not fair. we should all get plaques."
35512,Sheldon,"leonard, this is tom."
34442,Sheldon,use new eggs. .
42260,Sheldon,move across the hall? did you take a marijuana?
44684,Sheldon,"when we’re sleeping, she breathes on me. one night, it got so bad i almost grabbed toto "
41883,Sheldon,"oh, really? because i remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?"
34324,Sheldon,"watch your fingers. watch your fingers. oh god, my fingers!"
42787,Sheldon,"no, it’s not fine. what kind of store in the 21st century doesn’t at least have wi-fi? i’m going to call their corporate office. son of a biscuit."
41072,Sheldon,"…tion. okay. for the sake of argument, let’s say i have a problem. what would be your plan for addressing it?"
36088,Sheldon,"no. you, too, are safe."
38413,Sheldon,include me in what? is there a plot afoot? i’ll have no truck with plots.
44089,Sheldon,"oh, and speaking of valentine’s day, i haven’t forgotten about you tonight."
37328,Sheldon,"not lima beans, carbon atoms."
36416,Sheldon,"rut? i think you mean consistency. and if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it thursday? let’s call it quonko day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god ra."
42377,Sheldon,"i’m a teacher, leonard. it’s my job."
39903,Sheldon,"surely. scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…"
34666,Sheldon,i imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers. 
44301,Sheldon,"hey, now, wait. have we started? do i drink? what is happening?"
43435,Sheldon,"yeah. i know. turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. i blame madonna."
45564,Sheldon,oh. you must be one of those dessert before dinner people.
36452,Sheldon,"i am asserting, in the event that batman’s death proves permanent, that original robin, dick grayson, is the logical successor to the bat cowl."
38688,Sheldon,"so is the mcrib sandwich. i don’t care for that, either."
39992,Sheldon,"oh, it’s not your fault. i’ve been to the model train store. i’ve been to radio shack. this woman is impossible to shop for."
38231,Sheldon,"for shame, leonard. for shame. and to think i was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you."
39165,Sheldon,still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
42162,Sheldon,"i don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, i’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. which means, and again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. again, no offence."
37435,Sheldon,with the little stars?
42980,Sheldon,may i say something?
39916,Sheldon,i’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
39364,Sheldon,"i did, but i think i’ve kind of outgrown star trek. you know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. what a load of hooey."
41808,Sheldon,"it’s live. go, go, go, go, go."
34857,Sheldon,"yes, but, he can relapse if penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again."
39116,Sheldon,i knew i should have given my pope the jet pack.
37974,Sheldon,good night. appendicitis. what a nervous nelly.
39927,Sheldon,i was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
36111,Sheldon,i’m never silly. here.
39759,Sheldon,"i think you’ll like the drill tonight. i’ve tried to make it fun. each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by canada. pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe."
37126,Sheldon,"research journal, entry one. i’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching penny physics. i’m calling it project gorilla."
43678,Sheldon,i don’t understand.
34617,Sheldon,good night leonard. 
41670,Sheldon,not to me. the only other retraction i ever had to issue was when i was seven and i conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in east texas. but that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.
34795,Sheldon,because i knew you’d screw this up.
43023,Sheldon,"okay. wait, hang on. bladder check. we’re good to go."
40712,Sheldon,"well, y-you, i-i’m just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman’s menstrual cycle…"
44175,Sheldon,"oh. oh, now, you know i hate change. say it."
42707,Sheldon,how about four thousand. one for every domino i set up to make that american flag. please enjoy these highlights.
37398,Sheldon,"no, that seemed a little farfetched."
41597,Sheldon,"mmm. you know, i’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so i’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful."
44844,Sheldon,would you care for a brandy?
39602,Sheldon,oh. i thought it was a game.
39312,Sheldon,"because it’s working. in the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, i’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and i’m close to figuring out why the large hadron collider has yet to isolate the higgs boson particle."
40298,Sheldon,"my point is i don’t like when things change. so, regardless of your feelings, i would like you to continue dating leonard. and also, while we’re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. i’m not comfortable with the new scent. please stop this madness and go back to green apple."
39859,Sheldon,"yes, that’s what i think. and i’m super smart, so it’s probably true."
38325,Sheldon,"no. if anything, i made it worse. in any case, i have been riddled with guilt, which is causing gorn-infested rem sleep. so, i’m here now to say i’m sorry."
41573,Sheldon,"how about this? i promise i won’t pester you about the dvd. you can defecate in peace. that’s a win for both of us. but, until this matter is resolved, i would like you to wear this sweater. with nothing underneath it."
34254,Sheldon,"you? no, you’ll only make it worse."
40311,Sheldon,call me a romantic. i like to think that your mark ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
45388,Sheldon,"leonard, would you be a lamb?"
35203,Sheldon,"have i pointed out that i am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity. "
37331,Sheldon,the plural of coccyx is coccyges.
36182,Sheldon,i think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my physics department paintball strategy meeting.
37232,Sheldon,i’m sheldon. how do you do?
42466,Sheldon,"yeah, well, of course i am. i was also right about her hair. it did everything but quack."
38453,Sheldon,i think i’ll eat my lunch at home.
39528,Sheldon,"the question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? my first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup."
42223,Sheldon,thanks for coming with me.
44325,Sheldon,"and yet you get to weigh in. democracy, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it?"
34408,Sheldon,"oh, okay, well then, calm down."
36050,Sheldon,the skills are transferrable. i just have no interest in going in the water.
37282,Sheldon,uh-huh.
36475,Sheldon,"i’m just in a good mood. while my compatriots are in las vegas, i will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal fortress of solitude."
43235,Sheldon,excellent.
40002,Sheldon,when is the last time i asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency?
44775,Sheldon,jlyajbe’. dah nep’a’ penny? 
43360,Sheldon,"well, i just asked her if i should start watching the new flash tv series."
36341,Sheldon,brilliant. men love bluetooth.
38450,Sheldon,using kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
34473,Sheldon,it’s a billion dollar idea. shhhhh!
34282,Sheldon,my apologies. what’s your plan.
35404,Sheldon,"everybody has a date. even you, mario, going after princess peach. and what am i doing, i’m just enabling you."
38861,Sheldon,um…
37071,Sheldon,"all right. these are the talking points for my npr interview tomorrow. i need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you."
36158,Sheldon,the frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
37077,Sheldon,"my pleasure, ira."
35312,Sheldon,"well i’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that i could choose whether or not i wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. you can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis. "
35994,Sheldon,is it wrong to say i love our killer robot?
42786,Sheldon,i’ll look them up. son of a biscuit.
39936,Sheldon,"no, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and i’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them. uh, excuse me. do you have access to my haircut records?"
42397,Sheldon,you violated the sanctity of my mouth.
35412,Sheldon,penny.
45474,Sheldon,"it really doesn’t matter, as long as it’s challenging."
35199,Sheldon,"well alright, but i don’t see this as a promising endeavour."
43353,Sheldon,"irony’s not really my strong suit. but i have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try."
42679,Sheldon,"oh, this isn’t for leonard, no. amy bought it for me."
38312,Sheldon,"thank you for agreeing to see me, agent page."
44867,Sheldon,"i admire you, leonard."
42586,Sheldon,so what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?
45072,Sheldon,and that’s how you make effort look effortless.
37481,Sheldon,i object. you’re completely ignoring the law.
44070,Sheldon,"all right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. now, i realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?"
34925,Sheldon,"i did not think of that. clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while i still understand what a spoon is for. "
43295,Sheldon,hello.
42367,Sheldon,no.
41649,Sheldon,"oh, great, now, i work the controls, i say all aboard. you sit quietly and watch."
42618,Sheldon,thank you.
36667,Sheldon,you see? people have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
41015,Sheldon,"or, the chainsaw."
43705,Sheldon,wouldn’t you like to know?
42930,Sheldon,he’s right. i say we call this person back. we’ve got no reason to hide.
45146,Sheldon,"oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. as long as that’s not a urinary tract infection, that’s a personal best."
36908,Sheldon,"you’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites."
45806,Sheldon,bazinga.
38690,Sheldon,why don’t we leave that for future generations to decide?
37747,Sheldon,"okay, but just don’t fight"
35910,Sheldon,"fyi, i was defrosting a steak in there."
38280,Sheldon,"excuse me. if we’re changing topics, i believe i have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo."
40699,Sheldon,full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.
38567,Sheldon,don’t thank me. you earned it.
35289,Sheldon,"you also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. but go on. "
36655,Sheldon,that seems like a bit of an overreaction.
38438,Sheldon,"all right, let’s start over. what did you say when zack walked in?"
36634,Sheldon,three months. this is gonna be great!
39104,Sheldon,fascinating. what’s in it?
40177,Sheldon,"oh, dear lord. two years ago, we didn’t even know each other, and now i’m in your apartment after dark. how much faster can this thing go?"
40174,Sheldon,it’s not an accident. i waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
34267,Sheldon,do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your luke skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
34867,Sheldon,"no, that’s the least of our worries. i’ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and i think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie. "
40317,Sheldon,yeah. and forgive my crude penmanship. i didn’t start typing until i was six.
40563,Sheldon,get off there.
44614,Sheldon,don’t try luring me in with sexy talk.
42592,Sheldon,"leonard, as your friend i feel i should tell you something."
44685,Sheldon,she’s always complaining about people at work.
38825,Sheldon,"don’t make this harder than it is, leonard."
42171,Sheldon,"gentlemen, star wars day is rapidly approaching. we should finalize our plans."
36784,Sheldon,"you mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?"
42098,Sheldon,"oh, i’m in your hands. do a good job and i’ll tell you cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your pms."
43054,Sheldon,would you have approved?
37699,Sheldon,"oh, that’s not necessary. you can go first."
41860,Sheldon,"oh, my. well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot."
21816,Sheldon,the second barrier. don’t get cocky. this is the bathroom. are you fairly regular?
37191,Sheldon,"to comfort you, of course. no, that’s not going to work at all, i’ll comfort you from over here. leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit."
38692,Sheldon,"now, in this pivotal scene, sheldon’s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the united federation of planets, mr. spock, the role i will bring to life."
40165,Sheldon,i just threw up the bachelor party.
41861,Sheldon,it’s magnificent. this is going to be the best valentine’s day ever.
36559,Sheldon,"you actually had it right in the first place. once again, you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. bazinga! well, now here’s a peculiar e-mail. the president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m."
44152,Sheldon,i enjoy marching bands and tibetan throat singing.
37436,Sheldon,heated to 180 degrees?
37847,Sheldon,"fyi, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night."
44269,Sheldon,"actually, yes. i do."
39171,Sheldon,why?
40892,Sheldon,"no. no, after everything you didn’t do for me tonight, i want you to have it."
39910,Sheldon,"i don’t think so, kripke. i’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day."
35148,Sheldon,i needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits. 
36149,Sheldon,darn. i can’t seem to get the hang of that.
40044,Sheldon,but it’s mint in box.
44623,Sheldon,"well, now, don’t be surprised if, like star trek, it’s cancelled in three."
34276,Sheldon,"you did not break up with joyce kim, she defected to north korea."
40426,Sheldon,what’s your point?
44404,Sheldon,"oh, the fun doesn’t stop. you’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast."
40593,Sheldon,is that your son?
40643,Sheldon,lucky.
43104,Sheldon,"you know, you’re right. yeah. you know, it’s like when stan lee and steve ditko created spider-man. stan lee may get all the credit, but steve ditko knows he was just as important. even though stan lee gets to be in all the marvel movies. and. and he’s far richer. and he’s a household name, you know? whereas, you know, you say ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes dits."
41004,Sheldon,"well, now, did you also have a dog? because i found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy."
37795,Sheldon,morning. i trust you had a pleasant night.
40632,Sheldon,excuse me. you’re not supposed to be enjoying this.
37804,Sheldon,no.
41272,Sheldon,don’t try and trick me into buying something i don’t want. now let’s talk aquaman. 
44753,Sheldon,i am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.
21813,Sheldon,why don’t you let me do this.
42973,Sheldon,penny?
36045,Sheldon,"yes, well it’s better than what wolowitz did. he drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum."
40368,Sheldon,"wait, no, no. no. the word is polish. see, look. polish sausage. and the, the model of the solar system developed by nicolaus copernicus, a polish astronomer. and then, finally, if that wasn’t enough, which it should have been, this is madame curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized french citizen, was polish by birth."
44526,Sheldon,"well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business."
36683,Sheldon,"evolution isn’t an opinion, it’s fact."
39743,Sheldon,cut! take 47.
35360,Sheldon,i’m batman. shhhhh!
44057,Sheldon,that’s a risk i’m willing to take.
45789,Sheldon,this is delightful.
45407,Sheldon,we really need to skedaddle. thank you.
35070,Sheldon,"that trophy is meaningless, i forfeited, therefore you did not win. "
40839,Sheldon,"okay. amy’s decided she wants to move in with me, so i need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. that’s a lot of product."
41377,Sheldon,"no, no, that’s not mine. it has a big spot on it."
38573,Sheldon,"oh, well then, by all means, carry on. i wouldn’t want to impede your progress."
45497,Sheldon,"i’m doing it. i’m doing it. i’m tall and i’m doing it.  ah, man."
40243,Sheldon,you can’t leave. i need you.
36236,Sheldon,"i’m simplifying the task of packing for our trip. see, by attaching rfid tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. i will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera."
45721,Sheldon,i’m going to need a larger shirt. this one’s a little tight under the arms.
43317,Sheldon,"oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. it describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid."
35238,Sheldon,"okay, we don’t have that in stock, but i can special order it for you."
40023,Sheldon,"yeah, i hate wedding receptions. i wish the bride and groom would take a cue from bilbo baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home."
36748,Sheldon,no.
45671,Sheldon,"no, i hear you fine. as i was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. the primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole."
36551,Sheldon,why does leonard get to go?
43716,Sheldon,"oh, not at all. as i said, the entire point of emulating spock was to rise above human emotion, which i’ve spent a lifetime mastering."
35973,Sheldon,"no. no, i brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. i’m going to need a ride to the mall."
34616,Sheldon,good. there there was really all i had. 
43529,Sheldon,we blew up feynman’s van.
34798,Sheldon,"okay, that is it. "
41389,Sheldon,"and i think i’ve got it. consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. why do they keep him?"
45762,Sheldon,"hello, mother."
37461,Sheldon,"now you see what you’ve done? because of you, we’re all going to miss stan lee."
34629,Sheldon,"one on one? we don’t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. one on one!"
45237,Sheldon,i’m gonna go as dumbledore.
38900,Sheldon,"this act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. it is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
40047,Sheldon,"illogical. oh, damn it spock, you’re right. i’ll do it."
44204,Sheldon,hello.
38589,Sheldon,"oh, penny, where do i begin? the simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality."
35695,Sheldon,i prefer to think of it as i’m pulling them forward.
43943,Sheldon,that’s a great idea. i’ve got it. we’ll call it cooper.
45102,Sheldon,"i know, and amy says i can’t have a train room."
43180,Sheldon,"so, what are you in for?"
41833,Sheldon,oh. is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of darth vader breathing?
45598,Sheldon,"although, amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me."
36217,Sheldon,what? wh-where did my cashew chicken come from?
35009,Sheldon,we could call it nuevo cherusalem. 
43091,Sheldon,"oh, that kid. poor leonard."
34266,Sheldon,"oh, of course."
40629,Sheldon,are you prepared to receive your punishment?
39061,Sheldon,"excellent question. do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor frank gorshin, in the star trek episode let that be your last battlefield?"
43834,Sheldon,of course. i’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… i know why the song was in my head.
37085,Sheldon,i never admit defeat.
40198,Sheldon,i assume we’re talking about you now?
38932,Sheldon,so my blade shall not taste blood tonight?
42642,Sheldon,"let’s see. oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak."
39844,Sheldon,way to kill the mood.
38165,Sheldon,"as if one of the plants from invasion of the body snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel."
41401,Sheldon,"that’s silly. almost as silly as dr. baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. this is more like little house on the preposterous."
37955,Sheldon,a hybrid dog and octopus. man’s underwater best friend.
38887,Sheldon,i hate you.
40612,Sheldon,"well, not with that attitude."
35307,Sheldon,do you know any card tricks?
34807,Sheldon,"now, who would do that?"
40583,Sheldon,"oh, of course, come in.  this is an authentic chinese throwing star, and i must warn you, i have seen many people throw them in movies."
44987,Sheldon,"oh, speaking of personal growth, i recently tried eating swiss chard. you know, i didn’t swallow it, but amy said it counted."
45018,Sheldon,i knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.
35549,Sheldon,"i can make it, but i won’t."
39412,Sheldon,that lecture was a waste of time. i made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. 
36806,Sheldon,i’m sorry.
34622,Sheldon,"if we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06."
42082,Sheldon,you mean your acting career?
40178,Sheldon,"oh, you brain monkeys kill me. dip away."
44471,Sheldon,"wu-wu, what? that’s what i called you till i got to know you better."
35338,Sheldon,don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
38919,Sheldon,"of course you did. it was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. but the bullies took it from us. well, no more. tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. what do you say? who’s with me?"
36067,Sheldon,"see, my initial approach to kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued stu the cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo."
38457,Sheldon,the alternative would be to think backwards. and that’s just remembering.
35121,Sheldon,well is that really necessary. if you need money you can always sell blood. and semen. 
36211,Sheldon,"from that key maker, i highly doubt it."
38331,Sheldon,i don’t like the olive garden. they treat me like family.
39101,Sheldon,"actually, i was wondering if i could add a third new chess piece. how do you think people would feel about prince joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?"
38076,Sheldon,"thank you, amy. here’s your cat. and here’s your $20."
40313,Sheldon,"oh, thank you, penny."
40755,Sheldon,"captain, what are your orders?"
44791,Sheldon,i hate your apartment.
40618,Sheldon,"no. i need to get you down for a nap. and for some reason, that vaporub gets you all fired up. "
44373,Sheldon,here goes nothing? this is the initial test of our prototype. can we give it a little more gravitas?
45754,Sheldon,shotgun.
35194,Sheldon,what about the cream cheese frosting.
34283,Sheldon,it’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
45093,Sheldon,"don’t fall for it. he’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you’re the bad guy."
36361,Sheldon,the horror!
45639,Sheldon,"i’m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue."
44440,Sheldon, amy.
41497,Sheldon,no.
38884,Sheldon,figure out the magic trick yet?
37429,Sheldon,really?
45735,Sheldon,"do you realize that in less than nine hours, arthur jeffries, aka professor proton, will be in our apartment?"
39177,Sheldon,i never kid about safety.
43724,Sheldon,"well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. as the vulcans say, kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish du stau."
43694,Sheldon,"dr. sheldon cooper, theoretical physicist, caltech."
40228,Sheldon,"yeah, wait, raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?"
39793,Sheldon,are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?
42496,Sheldon,"wait. whoa, whoa. is placed right?"
41589,Sheldon,"well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?"
35966,Sheldon,"no, because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of saturnalia."
34699,Sheldon,"damn you, walletnook.com."
35919,Sheldon,in which i am not an expert.
36297,Sheldon,"bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee."
41948,Sheldon,"in any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. to this day, i still get a monthly copy of granny on granny. which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth."
37388,Sheldon,"well, of course you are. who else would you take?"
34318,Sheldon,exactly half.
34311,Sheldon,"are you listening to yourself, it is well established that superman’s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from earth’s yellow sun."
38695,Sheldon,very well. i’ll set the scene.
21809,Sheldon,doesn’t concern you. you’ll be going to the university every day?
44730,Sheldon,"okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. i’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild."
39256,Sheldon,it certainly looks okay. has a strong toxic chemical smell. that’s reassuring.
40022,Sheldon,"oh, that’s very kind of you. next time i have a hankering to wash down a d cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, i’ll come a-knocking."
40271,Sheldon,"how can she not be sure how she feels? you know, when i have a feeling, i know it. trains? love them. swordfish? i love them, too. they’re fish with a sword for a nose."
35164,Sheldon,"you’re right. if someone wants to get at missy’s fallopian tubes, they’ll have to go through me. "
35597,Sheldon,is there a “check the check engine light light”?  o-o-o-oh!
37067,Sheldon,my thank you was not sincere.
44439,Sheldon,you’re a good man.
45605,Sheldon, amy. will you marry me?
41544,Sheldon,"well, that really hurt. "
34528,Sheldon,"big boy!  someone touched my board. oh god, my board. leonard! leonard!"
43396,Sheldon,amy has ended our relationship.
43125,Sheldon,"yeah, good for you, leonard. that’s a lovely little notion. kind of like, i wish i could talk to my uncle in chicago. yeah, now stand back while i invent the telephone. hello? oh, hold on. leonard, it’s your uncle. he says you just got burned."
34251,Sheldon,that’s interesting. leonard can’t process corn.
41195,Sheldon,wow. no wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.
35439,Sheldon,"you appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?"
44241,Sheldon,"well, no, i just, i, i don’t want to recycle it. and i don’t want store credit."
40030,Sheldon,yes.
21811,Sheldon,and you’ll be willing to drive me?
42299,Sheldon,"yeah, well, i understand that i’m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. while i slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. now, typically, i wear pyjamas, but i recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the man. i’ll have you know, mahatma gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. my good man, now, before you walk away, i know that i may appear deranged, but i am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. go ahead, ask. bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. my legs are getting cold. why won’t anybody help me?"
42394,Sheldon,can’t talk. spitball. probably gonna die.
36561,Sheldon,"that’s 14 hours away. for the next 840 minutes, i’m effectively one of heisenberg’s particles, i know where i am or i know how fast i’m going, but i can’t know both. yet how am i supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?"
35212,Sheldon,the entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
38817,Sheldon,"i didn’t say the snacks were for you now, did i, nosy rosie?"
40349,Sheldon,"okay, one vote for, one vote against. leonard, you’re the tiebreaker."
35625,Sheldon,and radio shack.
38938,Sheldon,i am sheldor of azeroth. i want my things back.
38222,Sheldon,my sympathies. i am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. can i interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
39913,Sheldon,"oh, of course you are. feel free to drop by any time."
39484,Sheldon,"the telephone. you know, leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. voice mail. curiouser and curiouser."
44024,Sheldon,"that is true. well, i suppose i should apologize again."
39697,Sheldon,you want to know my opinion?
40891,Sheldon,"well, i don’t know what to say. this is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. and that’s including an amazing gift that i gave myself earlier today."
41986,Sheldon,"despite what her bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the old testament, they didn’t exist in the middle east until hundreds of years later."
35041,Sheldon,what?
35592,Sheldon,thank you for driving me to work.
45545,Sheldon,and if you see any actors from game of thrones in first class?
42156,Sheldon,"no, it’s not."
42474,Sheldon,"i know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. you thought of it september 22nd, 2007. two days later, penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town."
35845,Sheldon,i’m striking up a casual conversation with you. s’u’up?
39665,Sheldon,yes.
36976,Sheldon,"you can’t make a half-sandwich. if it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich."
45140,Sheldon,"gentlemen, we need to stop immediately."
42013,Sheldon,apparently any man is welcome in this house. why not you? i thought you were waiting in the car.
44264,Sheldon,only you.
37290,Sheldon, leonard and penny!
35440,Sheldon,alright then.  
34779,Sheldon,"excuse me, little idea? "
37655,Sheldon,i so loathe you.
41594,Sheldon,"i was going to mention it at the time, but then i thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment."
39529,Sheldon,hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
35082,Sheldon,"i wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia. "
38459,Sheldon,"i thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. but recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. like you."
45401,Sheldon,"um, yes. howdy, partner. do you happen to recollect if i left a notebook in these here parts?"
38764,Sheldon,"don’t worry. as your tertiary friend, i am prepared to step in and comfort you."
44446,Sheldon,"no, it’s not fine. it is a breach of line etiquette."
39032,Sheldon,i don’t know how to process that.
36844,Sheldon,i said give it to me.
38585,Sheldon,with you?
38081,Sheldon,nothing. i just wanted to make raj stop talking.
37399,Sheldon,"i’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. at least once a day i ask how you are, even though i simply don’t care. i no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm and i abandoned my goal to master tuvan throat singing."
40654,Sheldon,melted snowmen? are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
43842,Sheldon,good. because i love you.
41059,Sheldon,why would the chinese make our dvr record paul blart: mall cop?
43377,Sheldon,outdoor? oh. i can rsvp no right now.
41764,Sheldon,"the university, they think they can do whatever they want. we just have to sit there and take it."
41862,Sheldon,"i’m prepared to say i love it, as soon as i confirm there are no hobos aboard."
42979,Sheldon,"oh, i can help you with that. imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen. while your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket."
40813,Sheldon,"oh, really, leonard? are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?"
40557,Sheldon,"oh, that. well, see, i wanted it, and you weren’t using it. apparently, those are the rules we live by now. payback, it truly is the b word, isn’t it?"
42424,Sheldon,it has avocado on it. she’s allergic to avocado. are you so jealous of our relationship you want amy to die?
41399,Sheldon,"good night, indeed. what a rube. why would i put on lotion when i have such soft hands?"
37692,Sheldon,"well, of course i’m hungry. and as i have no plans to eat with any other team, i will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. mm, mm, mm!"
43514,Sheldon,what if it’s banditos shooting at us? what if we get kidnapped? what if we end up in a factory making bart simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?
37250,Sheldon,"well, i suppose. come in. i’ll sleep in leonard’s room. good night."
38234,Sheldon,there it is. what if someone asks?
43557,Sheldon,"fine, then i was like pinocchio before that jerk geppetto went and made him a real boy."
40894,Sheldon,at the bottom.
45149,Sheldon,"you’ll never believe it. leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and i get to operate an actual locomotive."
42874,Sheldon,"yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. i have been hallucinating lately."
38754,Sheldon,she stiffed you?
41553,Sheldon,"actually, i don’t need that. i hacked into your e-mail account and read it."
43855,Sheldon,"those are the robes of the jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy."
40984,Sheldon,"oh, leonard. if i was prone to sarcasm, i’d say i was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets."
43058,Sheldon,"ugh, this again. amy, i’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. i don’t need another one."
34976,Sheldon,"why waste food. in texas when a cow goes dry they don’t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes. "
42796,Sheldon,"oh, here’s another one. i wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an a, but i don’t put it there because i don’t want you breaking one of your little legs when you’re supposed to be making my breakfast."
45055,Sheldon,bye.
43261,Sheldon,"building on building on that, there’s a new build-your-own pizza place on colorado."
45105,Sheldon,"yes. now, when the robots rise up, they’ll know that i’ve been rooting for them the whole time."
45536,Sheldon,"well, no, it’s just, i’m just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, i can’t skype it to you."
40336,Sheldon,"oh, in fact, she has. uh, her exact words were, what is that guy’s problem?"
39957,Sheldon,"i have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. but all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it’s clear now, i’ve been wasting my time."
38126,Sheldon,hu-u-urgh! leonard not jealous.
38441,Sheldon,"and the answer was zack, correct?"
36319,Sheldon,"that’s 4.9 penny blossoms per hour. based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you’ll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day."
37189,Sheldon,"oh, is it? we’re conversing. checkmate."
40602,Sheldon,"sadly, yes. amy’s taking me to a memorial service. it’s for one of her colleagues who is of asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to china."
34652,Sheldon,"hmmph, wrong. "
34802,Sheldon,"oh we’ll see about that , heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone."
44530,Sheldon,"well, he doesn’t say it’s a good game."
41730,Sheldon,i think i’m hysterical.
39049,Sheldon,what’s he doing here?
40624,Sheldon,"it hurts that you would lie to me, amy. i thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour."
40938,Sheldon,"if you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time."
44166,Sheldon,i don’t think i can go back out there.
42879,Sheldon,"i knew you’d understand, armadillo isaac newton."
34388,Sheldon,"well, no."
37237,Sheldon,we scored. i’m the wingman.
35511,Sheldon,good to know. big old five.
41607,Sheldon,"yes, miss amy."
36740,Sheldon,i just said that. this conversation has started to circle. meeting adjourned.
41695,Sheldon,that’s so thoughtful. you guys are the best.
41669,Sheldon,i saw. and i just posted a retraction of my paper. now the whole scientific community knows i was wrong.
37332,Sheldon,good lord! you’re ruining everything!
37693,Sheldon,"just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?"
39011,Sheldon,move. move. move!
34931,Sheldon,"wait, where are you going? "
36216,Sheldon,yes. from szechuan palace.
41237,Sheldon,that you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
41242,Sheldon,"actually, i can’t. before leonard left, he made me promise that i’d take care of you."
35954,Sheldon,"your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. it is well established superman cleans his uniform by flying into earth’s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh."
44110,Sheldon,did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
35575,Sheldon,"yeah, we’re going to have to stop by pottery barn on the way to work, i bought these star wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. i don’t like the way darth vader stares at me."
40410,Sheldon,"okay. if you think being nice will get him to shut up, i’ll try it."
40407,Sheldon,yes! this party just became a major rager.
36226,Sheldon,she can’t shoot me. she’s dead.
36264,Sheldon,but the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
45412,Sheldon,great. now mandarin.
36982,Sheldon,irrelevant. the disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
45203,Sheldon,"that lady has a name. i don’t know what it is, but one time i accidentally called her mom."
43263,Sheldon,"you’re out, and you’re out. i win. who wants pizza?"
38090,Sheldon,it’s my office.
39249,Sheldon,there’s a wet band-aid on the shower floor. .
41372,Sheldon,it’s dirty laundry. you’re up.
42037,Sheldon,get? hang on. i don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously.
41456,Sheldon,but you didn’t even hear the details.
37960,Sheldon,it’s a small price to pay.
34238,Sheldon,"in all of them, that is the point."
38290,Sheldon,"for the record, i truly support the fbi in the mission which is expressed through their motto?"
43868,Sheldon, bernadette.
35309,Sheldon,you thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate? 
41922,Sheldon,it doesn’t?
45661,Sheldon,i guess i won’t be needing this.
43033,Sheldon,"i remember it perfectly. but i have an eidetic memory. if you’re interested, i also remember how much you owe us for the food."
43078,Sheldon,"good idea. and since you’ve had such a rough day, i’m gonna let you throw the pie in leonard’s face."
34676,Sheldon,"exactly, but we’d have to if she was here."
44594,Sheldon,"uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when i’m trying to get my life back on track?"
40187,Sheldon,"oh yummy, yummy! we should do this more often. uh-oh."
42883,Sheldon,"no, i don’t want to go to sleep, you can’t make me."
39040,Sheldon,i saved a nun’s life. why am i being punished?
42495,Sheldon,i think i have the same one.
34481,Sheldon,i went to the market with penny.
38832,Sheldon,question. was it a jacuzzi or a hot tub?
37561,Sheldon,what qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
42471,Sheldon,great. wait till you hear about our van.
40374,Sheldon,"it’s a game that i just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial spanish. um, ¿dónde está el boson de higgs?"
39582,Sheldon,"strap on a pair? of what, skates?"
45470,Sheldon,"yes. yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then i realized, it’s like the chemistry set i had as a kid. only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call poison control."
42122,Sheldon,i drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for stephen hawking.
37304,Sheldon,i’m fine. although i’m no longer the master of my own bladder.
34339,Sheldon,"i had no choice. i couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this."
43750,Sheldon,"and, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules."
44538,Sheldon,"or in german, a besserwisser."
39688,Sheldon,"thank you. amy, i’d like to apologize. your accomplishment was impressive. and i’m proud of you."
45770,Sheldon,i’m surprised you have to ask.
45438,Sheldon,fine.
41845,Sheldon,ay-yi-yi. 
37486,Sheldon,i need to use the restroom.
40460,Sheldon,it’s stephen hawking.
44840,Sheldon,i don’t understand. i thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me.
44407,Sheldon,"well, mind you now, that offer’s only good until the third trimester. i can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot."
38658,Sheldon, penny.
35849,Sheldon,her name is dr. stephanie barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial.
44069,Sheldon,"i’m gonna opt out of that one, too."
39943,Sheldon,"i can’t help it, i feel like a teen heartthrob."
44016,Sheldon,"and, emily, i’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. and i’m sure you’re tired of hearing that."
40981,Sheldon,"control over the information contained in that letter belongs to howard. by happenstance, i came to know it. that doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely."
40827,Sheldon,"uh, suppose i’ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. what a task that will be. do you know how uncivilized leonard was when i took him in?"
42711,Sheldon,don’t ask me. i’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.
43287,Sheldon,"we did it. oh, if it’s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it."
37838,Sheldon,i was wrong. penny can do better.
45276,Sheldon,"well, that’s been my room since before i met leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. and that someone else is not me. and you know how i feel about people who aren’t me. "
43032,Sheldon,"yeah, and you’re still eating our food."
45353,Sheldon,i love that one.
35285,Sheldon,then don’t.
40084,Sheldon,"oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. have you seen them on those little bicycles?"
37370,Sheldon,"a reasonable question. i asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an apple store genius, and what penny does. now, since i don’t like touching other people’s coins, and i refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here i am."
35596,Sheldon,"if it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. that’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine."
36942,Sheldon,oh! great roll! now you can demolish your soviet-style cyclotron and build the large hadron collider.
41084,Sheldon,and a complete sucker.
44905,Sheldon,do people know about her? ‘cause she’s delightful.
43161,Sheldon,what are you talking about?
43163,Sheldon,this is so amazing.
34851,Sheldon,"no, i made him up. i think you’d call him lee. "
41085,Sheldon,"i love you, too."
41813,Sheldon,"not sunday, i love sunday."
41485,Sheldon,this is the very copy of the handbook of chemistry and physics in which i looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…
12486,Leonard,no.
14082,Leonard,he’s right. you can’t. 
12059,Leonard,i said i’m sorry.
16664,Leonard,all righty then. guess i’ll just get started.
19825,Leonard,"yeah. that’s better than what i did say, which was, fine, i’ll eat them with club soda."
17641,Leonard,just explaining the theory of relativity. twice.
14588,Leonard,"uh-huh. now that raj is working for sheldon, i don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy."
14994,Leonard,"oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. everybody’s really excited about it."
16031,Leonard,there’s a big difference. arrow. lantern.
14808,Leonard,"come on, it wasn’t that bad."
14515,Leonard,"actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid."
15784,Leonard,huh! sorry!
18008,Leonard,two can play this game. penny…
20083,Leonard,"yeah? that’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song."
13925,Leonard,"well, i’m sure the guy living with sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you."
15002,Leonard,"no, i think it’s a firmware problem."
12867,Leonard,"no, we can’t. "
12170,Leonard,sheldon!
14343,Leonard,"you know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. you know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. and, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear."
16486,Leonard,very pretty.
20902,Leonard,"sheldon. we are dealing with an impossible deadline from the air force because of you. so have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, i don’t care."
21523,Leonard,absolutely. i just want you to be happy. and maybe a little turned on about how selfless i’m being.
18291,Leonard,"i thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights."
15215,Leonard,"why don’t i just start? sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?"
21206,Leonard,just ignore him.
19054,Leonard,"because i love penny, and want to give her the life she deserves."
14935,Leonard,"you know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with… "
13331,Leonard,you got penny to sign up for online dating?
12349,Leonard,sheldon? your mum made dinner.
12801,Leonard,you want me to get eye surgery? 
14696,Leonard,oh. did not know that.
17459,Leonard,hey. off to work?
14483,Leonard,"and bring you home. so, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back."
18656,Leonard,come on. it’s okay.
12446,Leonard,all i’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for penny to see me as a member of her peer group. a potential close friend and… perhaps more. i don’t want to look like a dork. 
21498,Leonard,"it’ll be fine, let’s just go."
12737,Leonard,because sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin leopold. 
16173,Leonard,"well, mrs. latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump."
20035,Leonard,of course not.
16474,Leonard,"okay, i’ll sign it!"
21487,Leonard,aw.
19865,Leonard,it gets a bad rap from shows like jersey shore and real housewives.
15165,Leonard,what are you doing?
12454,Leonard,"i  want to get to know penny’s friends, i just, i don’t know how to talk to these people. "
18059,Leonard,"that’s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there."
20999,Leonard,that’s right. i’m her change daddy.
13612,Leonard,what landing party?
20857,Leonard,"someday, when i’m up on murder charges, you’ll be hearing from me."
18980,Leonard,"i proposed twice, you proposed once. two to one."
15962,Leonard,yeah. they do that when you set it on easy.
12485,Leonard,what’s that?
19344,Leonard,"hmm, to be honest, it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you."
19181,Leonard,"this is fun, huh? we get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game."
14353,Leonard,okay… i just… i kind of…
19619,Leonard,what do you think?
21278,Leonard,so you’re gonna throw me under the bus?
15895,Leonard,who’s there?
12994,Leonard,"come on, guys, push. "
17036,Leonard,no.
19778,Leonard,"well, you picked a good one to start. wil’s had lots of great guests. jonathan frakes, brent spiner, michael dorn, gates mcfadden."
16454,Leonard,oh. cool. i’ve got a lawyer. and i’ve seen her naked.
12105,Leonard,to mend her broken heart. this situation is much less complicated. there’s some kind of dispute between penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the tv. she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
12861,Leonard,"howard, he’s fifteen."
17226,Leonard,"no, don’t aw him. he brought this all on himself."
13561,Leonard,psst! psst!
15453,Leonard,"uh, that’s a great question, zack."
20704,Leonard,how come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?
14178,Leonard,no!
21723,Leonard,i’m leonard hofstadter. i called you about the apartment. you said…
18896,Leonard,yes.
16327,Leonard,small world.
19262,Leonard,the one i gave you?
15958,Leonard,"i have a list. fyi, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12."
17620,Leonard,that is a pencil sharpener.
20446,Leonard,"well, you were right, tears."
16968,Leonard,i want to return this wild west and witches ka’a expansion pack.
15230,Leonard,you’re welcome. i just wanted to put that out there.
15239,Leonard,can we please talk about something else? maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
14645,Leonard,we’re heading out for some kite fighting.
13540,Leonard,are you kidding me? i already have two strikes.
21228,Leonard,i don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.
18605,Leonard,"oh, good. is the baby born yet?"
21556,Leonard,"wait, isn’t she the grad student that used to follow him around?"
17319,Leonard,richard feynman was a famous physicist.
19766,Leonard,"yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed wookiee."
15022,Leonard,hi. i’m dr. hofstadter. where is he?
21217,Leonard,okay.
17306,Leonard,"did you have fun? because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. now that’s, that-that’s what chess is all about."
21661,Leonard,"you look beautiful, lieutenant uhura. now prepare for inspection."
14754,Leonard,where are you going? you just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
15172,Leonard,how am i looking now?
20192,Leonard,done.
20173,Leonard,that shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.
14791,Leonard,"all right, everyone grab flashlights."
17994,Leonard,"oh, wow."
21252,Leonard,"hey, great news. the tv i want will fit in the gaming room, and if i leave the curtains open, i can watch it from work."
20625,Leonard,this game’s dangerous. i could get you in trouble.
19962,Leonard,nothing really. it was just kissing.
20676,Leonard,"if sheldon’s testosterone dipped, he’d become a butterfly.  oh. maybe someone’s here to apologize."
12005,Leonard,"agreed, what’s your point?"
16417,Leonard,"oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. you sit."
18764,Leonard,okay. koothrappali was right. we should have let her watch.
14470,Leonard,"trust me, you’ll be fine. see ya."
12412,Leonard,"yeah, well, i’m just glad to be a part of it. so what happens now?"
21055,Leonard,"okay, well, good luck with it."
20293,Leonard,nice try. nsync forever.
17860,Leonard,"hang on. are you feeling insecure? because that’s my thing, and if you take it away, i don’t know what i’m bringing to this relationship."
13798,Leonard,"what did i ever do to jimmy mullins in the third grade? he still punched me in the face with my own fists. sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys’ room at the wrong time."
19231,Leonard,what do you mean?
17648,Leonard,"why do you think i’d be like that? i get it, you’re taking one class. it’s nice. maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college."
21772,Leonard,"oh, man. is that a two-stage rocket?"
12002,Leonard,"this is hot tub time machine all over again. if future biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with marty and doc in it. because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 biff placed his first bet."
16195,Leonard,"no, it’s true."
16496,Leonard,"well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing."
20570,Leonard,hey. what are you doing here?
15135,Leonard,"oh, come on, why would you do that?"
19661,Leonard,"hey, hey. listen, i, i have a little confession to make."
19377,Leonard,"okay, why?"
14905,Leonard,"you’re right, i do feel better."
19398,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m sorry i didn’t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing."
14262,Leonard,"god, i hope not. and no, i’m not princess leia."
15489,Leonard,"uh, not bad. you remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?"
18953,Leonard,"sheldon, i’ve got some bad news."
13293,Leonard,"okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories."
20759,Leonard,you do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?
21782,Leonard,"oh, this is pretty nice. uh, the bedrooms are back there?"
19302,Leonard,can i help you?
14469,Leonard,"well, you know, i gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… oh, come on, i don’t want to go to texas!"
14802,Leonard,hey.
17689,Leonard,hold on. wil and amy had an argument?
18497,Leonard,"monday morning i’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the dvd. pay the late fee, and prove to sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. ah!"
12030,Leonard,"hi. well, uh, oh, welcome to the building."
20747,Leonard,"oh, let me try."
15123,Leonard,hey. guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on thursday?
15458,Leonard,"yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. the fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane."
16002,Leonard,why me?
12066,Leonard,"well, if that was a movie i would go see it."
13179,Leonard,"so, gas."
19873,Leonard,"greetings, distinguished cheerleaders."
14558,Leonard,"well, you shouldn’t."
16768,Leonard,"uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct."
16840,Leonard,"well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and i’m pretty sure alice is the stuff i want to do."
13763,Leonard,since when?
13904,Leonard,"but if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in green lantern’s ass."
15482,Leonard,"how am i supposed to let it go? you used me for sex! morning, mrs. gunderson."
17163,Leonard,"no, you should. absolutely. that was me being pedantic. that’s our first bug. you reported it. i can fix that. see? this is good."
17255,Leonard,"is that your laundry? you only have, like, six things in there."
20498,Leonard,wow. i’ve never thought about that.
16218,Leonard,what are you doing here?
21076,Leonard,"really, why?"
20255,Leonard,"well, he’s having a rough time. amy broke his heart, the dvr cut off the last minute of doctor who. that crow followed him home."
16598,Leonard,"well, uh, okay, um, i don’t want to get back together with penny. we tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but i can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend raj. and then i find out that raj’s sister priya, who i’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to india. so i’m just completely confused and alone."
17170,Leonard,my bug report to you.
16997,Leonard,sure. you want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
18264,Leonard,"uh, sure, that’s why i did it."
16847,Leonard,but i kind of have a girlfriend.
20750,Leonard,thanks.
18722,Leonard,"i did it, i did it, i’m in the queue."
17987,Leonard,you could be a little more into it.
15349,Leonard,"are you hungry, thirsty? can i offer you anything?"
18415,Leonard,"yeah, definitely better before."
20680,Leonard,"i don’t know how you put up with it. he’s impossible. i mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy."
18956,Leonard,comforting you?
18706,Leonard,"oh, hey."
15311,Leonard,yes.
17799,Leonard,"okay, come on, moving on."
19733,Leonard,"no, listen, we wrote a paper together. now we get to go to a university and talk about it? that’s pretty cool."
16300,Leonard,"yeah, bitches are the worst."
19139,Leonard,"come on, give him a hard one."
13835,Leonard,"go, go, go, go!"
13655,Leonard,"no, it’s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone."
19752,Leonard,right.
14033,Leonard,i don’t care about that.
14825,Leonard,at least they don’t know it was you.
20416,Leonard,you think they’ll still go on the trip?
17313,Leonard,"i got to tell you, i’m a little worried about him."
16762,Leonard,so what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?
13564,Leonard,i can’t tell you that.
20589,Leonard,come on. we’re a couple of smart guys. i’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.
17057,Leonard,how come you’re not doing a mission? you’re just wandering around.
18798,Leonard,nary an argument? nary?
17800,Leonard,okay…
15397,Leonard,hey.
19603,Leonard,the place really looks great.
13294,Leonard,"sheldon, don’t make that noise, it’s disrespectful."
21349,Leonard,see? miserable.
17886,Leonard,to show people when they don’t believe me.
18893,Leonard,"so, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?"
18377,Leonard,"oh, oh, i have. so bad."
21623,Leonard,"hey, penny, it’s leonard. good news, you can take your head out of the oven."
17331,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, clear your weekend. starting saturday morning, star wars< marathon"
21110,Leonard,you know what? there is one thing i would like.
15250,Leonard,no reason. i’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.
21113,Leonard,but you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.
18167,Leonard,hire him to do what?
14893,Leonard,when did this happen?
17431,Leonard,check it out. it’s the gas i use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. but it also has an interesting secondary use. here. breathe this in.
20582,Leonard,penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype.
16197,Leonard,i hadn’t really given it much thought.
15625,Leonard,"uh, went splitsville."
16260,Leonard,of course i’ll be back. i live here!
12889,Leonard,will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question? 
21264,Leonard,i said no.
12519,Leonard,are you sure?
13689,Leonard,"i don’t care what you guys think, stephanie and i are very happy living together. i will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me."
20928,Leonard,you guys have fun.
14775,Leonard,"of course, they did. that’s what grandmothers do."
15840,Leonard,very hard.
16455,Leonard,"top of her class, cambridge university. licensed to practice law in three countries. and your face."
17900,Leonard,"look at us, sheldon. we’re the crazy people."
16356,Leonard,"okay, what exactly are we looking for?"
18938,Leonard,he’d probably give you homework.
15953,Leonard,"you got to admit, i am, i’m delightful."
14471,Leonard,"yeah, but i already saw him naked. just come here."
17469,Leonard,"there’s howard’s rocket, live from kazakhstan."
13172,Leonard,i made an eight o’clock reservation.
13215,Leonard,that was fast. 
17198,Leonard,because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.
14244,Leonard,take me to a bar with women.
19952,Leonard,doesn’t sound very romantic.
16951,Leonard,maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.
16656,Leonard,i don’t think so.
15782,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, no. you just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. come on, i’ll help you. so, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?"
15286,Leonard,"where you going with this, raj?"
19195,Leonard,"oh, kids buy comic books. it would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store."
15034,Leonard,"yeah, i’m going to need a little more."
18637,Leonard,"i don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things."
14465,Leonard,"it’s actually a pretty simple process. you see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on…  "
14690,Leonard,"anyway, wish me luck."
21468,Leonard,don’t you have any friends he can date?
20943,Leonard,do it.
12621,Leonard,"okay, let me put it this way, i’m doing it."
19611,Leonard,"i don’t know. i mean, if he’s not nice, it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again."
14980,Leonard,who is it?
13772,Leonard,"yeah, i know. i’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. you always said you had yoga."
19652,Leonard,"i was unstoppable. i mean, i was, i was on fire. it was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone."
18699,Leonard,yeah.
12283,Leonard,yes.
14407,Leonard,"okay, i can’t do this."
20566,Leonard,yeah.
18398,Leonard,"sheldon, i’ve known you a long time, and i’m going to tell you this with all the love i can possibly muster. amy’s right. you’re wrong."
20826,Leonard,"here you are, mother."
17795,Leonard,"okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. sheldon, what do you do?"
13380,Leonard,"alright, it’s shredded, what do you want me to do?"
17588,Leonard,no.
12239,Leonard,"pfff, i’ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. anyway, i was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay. "
16230,Leonard,"what, with my tongue in your tail?"
16108,Leonard,"okay, when you say make the best of it."
18199,Leonard,i push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
18057,Leonard,that’s actually good. why didn’t i think of that?
12862,Leonard,"howard, that’s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. "
20013,Leonard,i’m okay.
21306,Leonard,"oh, we can get this. is there any chance it’s upside-down?"
13370,Leonard,pass.
18194,Leonard,"i’ve got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma."
13863,Leonard,where are we going?
13643,Leonard,"oh, are you still going to spend the night?"
17829,Leonard,what recordings?
12492,Leonard,there there. 
15596,Leonard,i’m going to my room.
16855,Leonard,it is?
15901,Leonard,what’s a stadium pal?
19154,Leonard,that’s the part you have a problem with?
13770,Leonard,"what it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. it’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan."
14760,Leonard,"hey, stuart, have you seen sheldon?"
12885,Leonard,"sheldon, what, do i need to quote spock’s dying words to you."
20339,Leonard,"no, it’s steel magnolias 2: even steelier."
13926,Leonard,really?
21627,Leonard,"okay, well, um, what about this? what does this mean?"
13520,Leonard,"oh, come on, it’s easy, he’ll even tell you what to say."
21557,Leonard,"knowing sheldon, nothing."
16307,Leonard,"i’m sorry, but i’m gonna count that."
19569,Leonard,"okay, partner, let’s do it."
18364,Leonard,"nothing, i’m fine."
12688,Leonard,no you don’t. no he doesn’t.
16380,Leonard,"okay, let’s get clear on something. we’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. no one’s bat’lething anybody."
17322,Leonard,poor guy. he must have been exhausted. sheldon like to sleep while leonard play the bongo!
13921,Leonard,and that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
21332,Leonard,"yeah. well, we work at the same place as you, and we’ve always been fine."
17992,Leonard,"oh, that’s cool."
16110,Leonard,"star trek. you know, the neutral zone between the federation and the romulan empire."
16742,Leonard,"pretty cool about howard, huh?"
18601,Leonard,the end.
19660,Leonard,"well, congratulations. who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?"
15823,Leonard,"oh, i’m so sure i’m going to regret this, but, who was i with?"
17831,Leonard,"well, most of saturday’s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we’re done. how about you?"
14912,Leonard,"wait a minute, what are you talking about? what inappropriate behaviour?"
13626,Leonard,"general order 104, section a does not apply in this situation."
14348,Leonard,i deliberately tried to sabotage stuart’s date with penny.
12411,Leonard,who wouldn’t? 
12404,Leonard,"regardless, i have a chance at a real relationship with lesley, i’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy. "
21207,Leonard,what’s that supposed to mean?
17858,Leonard,of course not. no. why?
13783,Leonard,he tried to take nude photos of you?
13681,Leonard,"uh, the big dog is goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , i have no idea. we’re not living together!"
13744,Leonard,you want to work with me?
21726,Leonard,telling you? telling you.
13807,Leonard,"i don’t know, now they’re just yelling about popsicles. sounds like penny really got to him."
14888,Leonard,i don’t know what you’re talking about.
13826,Leonard,"sheldon, we have to call it off."
14393,Leonard,hang on. let’s talk about it. this is a national science foundation expedition. i don’t know how we can turn it down.
20622,Leonard,i’ve never played that before.
14988,Leonard,what are you doing? use the door.
17958,Leonard,what?
14282,Leonard,alright.
18062,Leonard,"okay, who’s ready for some science? me, too. okay, i am dr. leonard hofstadter. i am here with my friends dr. cooper and real-life astronaut howard wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. how cool, you ask? well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. did i just learn something new and have fun doing it? what? all right. so now let’s bring out theoretical physicist dr. sheldon cooper."
12086,Leonard,"that’s great, you guys have to go."
13176,Leonard,it’s also not pink and has no berries.
20639,Leonard,that’s not true.
17611,Leonard,"okay. hey, howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?"
18677,Leonard,"you need to let it go, sheldon."
16097,Leonard,they’re bigger than mine.
13531,Leonard,"hey, you guys are talking again. good. what happened?"
19710,Leonard,i’m the one who thought of it.
12335,Leonard,what happened to your scrambled egg research?
12937,Leonard,"hang on. sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team. "
19167,Leonard,why not?
17059,Leonard,you want to talk about it?
14924,Leonard,great. how come?
21143,Leonard,"damn, i need my inhaler."
17442,Leonard,"i’m sorry. just, just give me another chance."
18307,Leonard,"all right, let’s, let’s do couples. i want to."
20871,Leonard,wish we weren’t so far from my parking space.
19734,Leonard,what? this road trip just got crazy.
19058,Leonard,"i know you’ll try. so, should we talk about setting a date?"
14655,Leonard,"so, penny doesn’t want me around her friends, i embarrass her. what else could it be?"
17665,Leonard,"maybe since you’re so good, he’s taking his time to meet the challenge. i want penny to enjoy school…"
19035,Leonard,"before i tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?"
12685,Leonard,what? oh we just had to… mail some letters and 
16607,Leonard,let’s get ’em!
18705,Leonard,and i support you.
14312,Leonard,"yeah, or you call me."
13267,Leonard,"well, the thing is, someone’s coming over."
14295,Leonard,"okay, great. um… uh, the thing is, we’ve got this friend, and he’s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up."
12578,Leonard,"i’m not a big fan of musicals, but i love that show. "
14024,Leonard,i forget. which one is hammer of the gods?
15670,Leonard,he’s glissinda the troll.
18453,Leonard,"he’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if i’d take a look at it."
17441,Leonard,it was the heat of the moment.
18979,Leonard,i was not gonna propose. it’s already two to one.
12277,Leonard,i’m having a panic attack.
19219,Leonard,"hey. so, the guys and i are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. i just wanted to know if that’s okay. you and i had talked about going to brunch on sunday."
19562,Leonard,you worked out all the math.
12778,Leonard,yes.
16261,Leonard,this is delicious. where’d you learn to make chili?
13620,Leonard,"no, just sit here."
21518,Leonard,"yeah, sorry."
19963,Leonard,"and then nothing. i stopped it. but it still bothers me, and i wanted you to know."
17320,Leonard,"sheldon, go to bed. you have work in the morning."
13499,Leonard,i asked.
19848,Leonard,how is that building on what he just said?
21659,Leonard,"come on, priya, just admit i embarrass you!"
13527,Leonard,"i reiterate, knuckle under."
18773,Leonard,how long should we stay?
13684,Leonard,"yeah, stephanie got them for me."
17268,Leonard,what choice did the university have? he snapped. it happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
16290,Leonard,oh. okay.
18897,Leonard,"i got to tell you, the more i read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited i get."
13339,Leonard,you’d do the dolphins.
17291,Leonard,hang in there. i’ll be right back. 
17645,Leonard,it’s crunchy. just the way i like it.
19017,Leonard,"you know i want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself."
16177,Leonard,"i was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night."
12405,Leonard,yeah. 
13379,Leonard,just sit down and eat.
18326,Leonard,got it.
18448,Leonard,"no, she’s not."
17193,Leonard,"sheldon, canada is not going to invade california."
21236,Leonard,"would you please help us make a relationship agreement? but one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule. "
19545,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
18851,Leonard,"oh, no, no. that’s clarence darrow. it’s from a game sheldon made up called chutes and lawyers. you slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system."
15686,Leonard,i’m not jealous.
16775,Leonard,"raj, what are you doing?"
16429,Leonard,"whatever it is, we’re here for you. you can tell us anything."
12786,Leonard,"yes, "
14125,Leonard,"he’s calling to ask you a favour. you might be confused because he didn’t use the words, penny, sheldon, please or favour."
14341,Leonard,"yeah, that too. everything’s broken."
20497,Leonard,yeah. why?
21070,Leonard,they say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
15434,Leonard,"so, we’re good?"
19218,Leonard,you would go to a beach house?
18826,Leonard,so are you really not gonna do this movie?
20975,Leonard,what? why not?
17173,Leonard,"so, have a good night."
21282,Leonard,"good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child."
15713,Leonard,right.
20182,Leonard,"oh, hey. i just heard back from the liquid helium guy."
14212,Leonard,problem?
16208,Leonard,"uh, sure. why?"
15363,Leonard,wow. you really make science come alive.
18832,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
13102,Leonard,"say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they’re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything. "
19171,Leonard,"um, whew? is this about the test, or is this about us?"
21756,Leonard,i didn’t even know her 12 hours ago.
12374,Leonard,"if penny didn’t know that lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, penny, thought that i should her, lesley, out, indicating that she, penny, had no interest in me asking her, penny, out. but because she did know that i had asked lesley out and that she, lesley, had turned me down then she, penny, could be offering consolation. that’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. but while thinking, good, leonard remains available. "
13298,Leonard,"wait, where are you going?"
13374,Leonard,yes.
20071,Leonard,"no, i don’t think so. although, penny did say exactly that."
17437,Leonard,so we won’t let it get weird.
18804,Leonard,"you make a lot of sense. i like this table, and i’m getting it."
15082,Leonard,it is.
15367,Leonard,something his mother taught him.
14241,Leonard,"hey, penny… and stuart, hey stuart."
21122,Leonard,hey.
16186,Leonard,"good night, sheldon."
19785,Leonard,"oh, if she was with an indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, howard and raj."
18314,Leonard,"relax, it’s a hard puzzle. it’s gonna take a while to solve."
14977,Leonard,great. good night.
14400,Leonard,"actually, it would help."
13779,Leonard,my leg is killing me. thanks for asking.
18184,Leonard,"yes, sir."
18610,Leonard,"well, good for you, buddy. we’ll let you get back in there."
15729,Leonard,"i want to invoke the girlfriend pact, howard."
18077,Leonard,"i’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. penny and i just want to do something low-key. you know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d’oeuvres."
20103,Leonard,"yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem."
12171,Leonard,"are you insane, you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean."
15474,Leonard,"i know. i just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective."
16782,Leonard,sorry. syrup.
21424,Leonard,"or we could do something we’ll all enjoy, like play a board game."
20733,Leonard,maybe we should take a step back.
13389,Leonard,"if we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. a guy who has your back."
15991,Leonard,do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
17794,Leonard,"okay, here we go. you find yourselves in the smoking remains of santa’s village. clearly, a great battle has taken place."
15016,Leonard,"no, that’s a crazy thing."
19629,Leonard,"how are you doing, stuart?"
19783,Leonard,really?
17719,Leonard,really? here?
13642,Leonard,i didn’t cry.
16986,Leonard,"yeah, because i have something weird to tell her."
13125,Leonard,no. no. 
12275,Leonard,you could have stopped at “it could go well.”
13645,Leonard,"hey, can you open this for me?"
18841,Leonard,"it’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing."
20951,Leonard,"good. then before we reintroduce them, we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again."
16250,Leonard,you do realize everyone’s eating at raj’s again tonight?
21251,Leonard,"no, raj, that’s a terrible idea."
16697,Leonard,"well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear.  ow! why did you do that?"
17001,Leonard,"you know what? i am tired of living in fear of this guy. i’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things i should have said in high school. you know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, i do know why i’m hitting myself.”"
14932,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
12575,Leonard,"yeah, we’re not like haroun and tanweer!"
15092,Leonard,what’s going on?
21326,Leonard,who forgot to crack the window?
17260,Leonard,good luck catching a man with that attitude.
12681,Leonard,"see, the liquid metal terminators were created in the future by skynet, and skynet was developed by miles dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to dyson’s death in terminator 2."
17333,Leonard,"we’ll miss you, sheldon."
13040,Leonard,i brought snacks.
20279,Leonard,"yeah, poor us."
16184,Leonard,i am not going to have sex with her.
19890,Leonard,"if you could run out and get a phd, that might make her like you."
19590,Leonard,what did you write?
15481,Leonard,"so, that’s it? wham, bam, thank you, leonard?"
14356,Leonard,"thanks for understanding, howard."
18078,Leonard,"hey, where have you been?"
18596,Leonard,"come on, i would not have peed my pants."
13290,Leonard,"you’re right, it is simple. "
13146,Leonard,what happened?
16595,Leonard,you called my mother?
15347,Leonard,"oh, i have so many things to tell your biographer."
17579,Leonard,"magnets: what do they stick to? if the answer is metal, it’s not exactly groundbreaking."
17374,Leonard,"so, is that one mine."
17735,Leonard,yeah. he’s ganged up.
13000,Leonard,it’s not about money.
17274,Leonard,it’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at.
21036,Leonard,but you won’t be living here.
16573,Leonard,she’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
12763,Leonard,"sheldon, relax, she doesn’t have any symptoms, i’m sure she’s not contagious."
19612,Leonard,he was a jerk because you rear-ended him.
12337,Leonard,fish nightlights.
13009,Leonard,he offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
19792,Leonard,"well, what if you get it?"
18043,Leonard,"well, is that all of it?  just set it down."
15555,Leonard,"uh, 12 bucks."
13070,Leonard,"nothing, just catching up. by the way, may i speak to missy please? "
21171,Leonard,"on purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school."
15146,Leonard,"one more floor, and i’d be the pulled muscle."
12212,Leonard,"warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands."
12961,Leonard,aaaa-aw! 
14668,Leonard,did not know that.
19850,Leonard,it’s not simon says.
14022,Leonard,"good-bye, mother."
20109,Leonard,they’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. let’s hope the lug nut expands.
21237,Leonard,what do you say?
21588,Leonard,what? 
12728,Leonard,i don’t know what to say. 
20771,Leonard,no.
12534,Leonard,penny’s still sleeping.
18989,Leonard,"now, about that second proposal. on the one hand…"
16212,Leonard,"wait, wait. what?"
15281,Leonard,"what about you, raj?"
19634,Leonard,"i’ve been listening to sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years. tag, you’re it."
14819,Leonard,let’s keep thinking.
19409,Leonard,"well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? what if, what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?"
14031,Leonard,are you done?
18885,Leonard,"okay, that’s enough."
18106,Leonard,i’m not gonna schmooze anybody. i’m gonna let my work speak for itself.
19996,Leonard,and you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?
14573,Leonard,what do you mean?
15524,Leonard,interesting. cause of death for uncle carl was kbb. what’s kbb?
18379,Leonard,mom?
15603,Leonard,"okay, that’s all i got. howard, you’re up."
16861,Leonard,"hey, amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?"
17225,Leonard,"no, thanks. i’m good."
20050,Leonard,"uh, first of all, you made that guy cry."
20321,Leonard,put on some headphones.
17740,Leonard,"hey, alex, let me ask you something. my girlfriend knows this guy at school. he’s got an english accent."
20894,Leonard,"that’s not helpful. it’s fun to think about, but it’s not helpful. hey, sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. we can’t do this without you. can you please pull it together?"
19425,Leonard,hey.
19396,Leonard,how is it my fault?
16369,Leonard,"hold on, you’re thinking of going there?"
18694,Leonard,bye.
19597,Leonard,stephen hawking liked our paper. said the premise is intriguing.
16766,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person."
17931,Leonard,"oh, no, no, no, i know this. uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?"
19205,Leonard,there’s something i wanted to run past you.
14026,Leonard,"yeah, more cutbacks."
18026,Leonard,you do?
20211,Leonard,we’re not getting caught.
20579,Leonard,"well, we got to make a run to the hardware store."
15392,Leonard,i don’t understand.
17747,Leonard,"come on, i’m sorry."
14464,Leonard,uh-huh. it’ll last forever. i preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
17690,Leonard,then amy got mad and left?
19471,Leonard,blue and yellow make green.
19849,Leonard,"building on that, i’d like to remind you, i’m lactose intolerant."
18625,Leonard,i take it back. that was funny.
13852,Leonard,i answered every question sheldon.
15936,Leonard,"really? how, how’d we manage that?"
15151,Leonard,we didn’t even get to go through it all. there could be anything in here.
15600,Leonard,okay.
15115,Leonard,"well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. do you think you’ll feel better by then?"
12473,Leonard,no. i’m going to assert my dominance face to face. 
12064,Leonard,"i don’t eat it, i just think it’s a good idea."
17658,Leonard,i did a bad thing.
16702,Leonard,are you gonna eat that whole pie?
15590,Leonard,all right. i like a good brainteaser. give it a whirl.
21570,Leonard,"you got feet and legs, you do it."
18019,Leonard,"fine, you win. you’re a bitch. why couldn’t we just have a nice time?"
16292,Leonard,"sure. oh, god, you smell so good. of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. hypothetically, if i had access to a lieutenant uhura uniform, would you wear it?"
17979,Leonard,since when don’t you want to live with me?
20909,Leonard,"right. sorry, sir."
12883,Leonard,"this is our year! with those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before zod. "
15703,Leonard,because i don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. i’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
14296,Leonard,i think she knows what i meant.
18438,Leonard,"no, no, it’s okay. it’s really thoughtful."
19440,Leonard,it’s not a moth.
14445,Leonard,"i missed you, too."
15382,Leonard,"no, but i was awake all night."
18020,Leonard,"okay, you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that."
19340,Leonard,don’t rule out the dating.
14115,Leonard,right. of course.
20717,Leonard,since my preschool got a bunny.
15249,Leonard,really? you love them?
19410,Leonard,this has to mean something.
17113,Leonard,"well, there was a lot at stake."
21269,Leonard,"if you get him a job, he’s gonna live here forever!"
15081,Leonard,"look, sheldon, i know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, i promise i will not kill you. in fact, i’ll even let you eat my brains. but i am taking penny to switzerland."
14097,Leonard,"sheldon, we’ve been on this train 90 seconds, and you’ve already said a thousand words. just tell us where to sit and shut up."
17490,Leonard,"mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity."
15402,Leonard,"nevertheless, i’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why i did what i did."
15096,Leonard,you hate babylon 5.
18642,Leonard,i don’t.
12107,Leonard,"hi, i’m leonard, this is sheldon."
19060,Leonard,"no, i thought he was with you."
14881,Leonard,"no, i heard that."
18784,Leonard,"oh. wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?"
21037,Leonard,but you won’t be living here.
13991,Leonard,he lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
21673,Leonard,"okay, i got to get back to work. thanks for listening."
21144,Leonard,"no, i went down the stairs too fast."
12148,Leonard,"easy, easy  okay! now we’ve got an inclined plane. the force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half. "
16631,Leonard,there’s no junk jiggling. we just talk.
18382,Leonard,i didn’t dream that?
12536,Leonard,almost 6:30. 
14197,Leonard,"hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?"
21621,Leonard,"howard, why aren’t you covering us? we’re getting slaughtered out here!"
20953,Leonard,"look, here’s the thing you need to understand about sheldon. he’s the worst."
17151,Leonard,"i don’t know, he was pretty badass on heroes."
14595,Leonard,that was fun. thank you.
17027,Leonard,yes.
15582,Leonard,what about it?
15260,Leonard,"yes, that’s what i’m telling you. we are good. we are great."
17483,Leonard,no.
16927,Leonard,"uh, right."
12731,Leonard,i don’t know what to say.
16938,Leonard,it’s cool. go back to kevin.
16916,Leonard,all the time.
18282,Leonard,why would anyone claim to be from new jersey if they weren’t?
16831,Leonard,"now, let’s not do anything rash. she’s really hot."
20692,Leonard,from amy.
17082,Leonard,"oh, boy, do i?"
14782,Leonard,you know what’s a cool name? angelo. that has angel and jell-o in it.
20552,Leonard,"well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all."
12305,Leonard,i’m not okay.
18420,Leonard,"buddy, i don’t think you can. i mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. this thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape."
13867,Leonard,"no you’re not, let’s go."
17571,Leonard,high-energy lasers.
15273,Leonard,i’m pretty sure it’s already over.
21747,Leonard,so where do you sleep?
13841,Leonard,hey kripke.
15615,Leonard,"well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you."
14719,Leonard,"oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. yippee."
13726,Leonard,"i really like you, but i want to see how things go with mark?"
16832,Leonard,priya and i are in love. i think we could get married someday.
17006,Leonard,scrotum.
12527,Leonard,i’ll get you a blanket and a pillow. 
13567,Leonard,what?
20406,Leonard,"he’s coming, too."
16780,Leonard,everything? aren’t you worried about your health?
16028,Leonard,then what are you?
13951,Leonard,"i guess, technically, that was my fault.  i’m not leaving here without penny’s money."
19544,Leonard,"i turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there."
13082,Leonard,"oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. i got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so…7"
14940,Leonard,how can i go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
15122,Leonard,he does. and in the kitchen. and in the car. and in his pocket.
16545,Leonard,sea bass. i’ll have the sea bass.
13541,Leonard,compromise. watch babylon 5.
12802,Leonard,i’m thinking! 
19727,Leonard,public restroom kit. everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.
14278,Leonard,"howard, could i borrow some after shave?"
21068,Leonard,"i know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip i’ve ever heard."
19801,Leonard,"what does that mean, under your bed?"
13860,Leonard,on the floor.
16889,Leonard,"yeah, sheldon, what would it take?"
16771,Leonard,"uh, yeah, it’s raj’s sister. it’s kind of tough. she’s in india. also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white."
12508,Leonard,well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut raj in half.
13245,Leonard,"you know what, i’m happy that penny’s moving on. it gives me the freedom to move on myself."
18814,Leonard,"mm, sheldon, you didn’t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked."
21311,Leonard,"well, sheldon, turns out we didn’t need you after all."
21449,Leonard,"it can’t be four revolutions, it’s got to be seven."
12410,Leonard,"i’m not sure, but i think i’m about to discover how the banana felt. "
19453,Leonard,"okay. on the count of three, i’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out."
14512,Leonard,"so, you’ve been through this before?"
20702,Leonard,what is it?
21414,Leonard,"well, she’s done."
19893,Leonard,what does that mean?
16541,Leonard,sure
21492,Leonard,more.
12498,Leonard,"yeah, i’m a frickin’ genius. "
17418,Leonard,"no, uh, that, that’s it. i don’t know much about women. raj, you got anything?"
11998,Leonard,"yeah, i know, i’m just a little concerned about you."
20274,Leonard,yeah.
12203,Leonard,what?
20696,Leonard,it just said italian sub. i had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.
17845,Leonard,"uh, i guess i am."
17654,Leonard,"it’s like when i started doing chin-ups, i didn’t want you to see until i could do one. fyi, really close."
17144,Leonard,unbelievable. 
18070,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s, wait, i can go home without you? bye."
19685,Leonard,"actually, your name is on the electric bill."
18673,Leonard,because i’m afraid to know the answer.
12421,Leonard,really?
14409,Leonard,what is it?
16674,Leonard,aw.
14450,Leonard,"because when he wasn’t happy, we wanted to kill him. there was even a plan. we were going to throw his kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death."
15650,Leonard,"yeah, it’s like if alien and predator decided to go partners in a jamba juice."
19476,Leonard,"you know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we’re into."
18823,Leonard,fine.
15174,Leonard,that’s my girl.
21199,Leonard,that’s nice. i wear a size eight and a half.
19235,Leonard,i don’t know. you did it to me.
17733,Leonard,"oh, cool. that cute blonde on four?"
18313,Leonard,"hey, penny, i just wanted to say good luck, and i hope there’s no hard feelings."
20051,Leonard,"secondly, i can’t think of a more horrible idea than penny meeting mandy."
15357,Leonard,"me neither. oh, look what i’m reading. it’s you."
12157,Leonard,"come on, we should go."
17560,Leonard,all i said was she seems nice.
21234,Leonard,hey.
17341,Leonard,"oh. so you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into speedy gonzalez?"
15464,Leonard,are you drunk?
16328,Leonard,"of course, i did. i talked and talked and talked."
18900,Leonard,"oh, i don’t know. maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started."
17977,Leonard,"well, if he doesn’t want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels."
21440,Leonard,"hey, olsen twins…"
16399,Leonard,"so, what’s the gossip?"
13529,Leonard,"there, see? problem solved."
12952,Leonard,yeah. and that’s my bid.
15799,Leonard,without.
12877,Leonard,"i don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, i have a rocket in my pants.”"
14127,Leonard,look at it. non-alcoholic beer.
12824,Leonard,"if i stand, i’ll vomit. "
20886,Leonard,"look at that, it is a party."
16954,Leonard,"you do? because if that’s what you like, i can be that guy. i swear, i’ll be anything you want me to be."
20757,Leonard,when’s the screening?
14459,Leonard,"sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?"
16734,Leonard,i was actually thinking about going.
18542,Leonard,you married him instead of me? good call. sign the papers.
21762,Leonard,"according to the roommate agreement, i’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas."
15106,Leonard,i’m sorry you feel that way.
16548,Leonard,"so, howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as mr. and dr. wolowitz?"
14326,Leonard,oh. it’s stuart.
14740,Leonard,no.
16630,Leonard,what?
16287,Leonard,"i know. i usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash."
20519,Leonard,can i get his contact info?
15012,Leonard,don’t tell koothrappali. after you.
13282,Leonard,"well, i think tonight was a very good start."
17009,Leonard,"yeah. you, too. uh, jimmy, this is sheldon and raj and howard."
20791,Leonard,"i was wrong, there’s three excuses for that."
19180,Leonard,"marriage is scary. you’re scared, i’m scared. but it doesn’t make me not want to do it. it, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you."
18730,Leonard,the same way i know that the people in the tv set can’t see me.
19384,Leonard,yeah?
21244,Leonard,you’re not being very nice.
17529,Leonard,what is it?
16826,Leonard,no. we just made out a little.
19505,Leonard,sheldon.
18318,Leonard,uh-huh. like death?
20065,Leonard,"you know, what we did, when we were drunk."
12626,Leonard,you forbid it?
13289,Leonard,don’t make this hard for me.
12678,Leonard,excuse me. is there anything you’d like to apologise for?
12660,Leonard,"a joke. okay. how about this, um, okay, uh there’s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t lay any eggs. so, he calls a physicist to help. the physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, i have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  right? "
17433,Leonard,i have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
20784,Leonard,"look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don’t like her."
17770,Leonard,mmm.
15181,Leonard,"i’m not letting go, you let go."
19465,Leonard,"no, our names are on the sign-in sheet."
13886,Leonard,"bye, sheldon."
15756,Leonard,i look forward to it.
14390,Leonard,how was it resolved?
16006,Leonard,"listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around."
15140,Leonard,"look at that. to my friend, leonard, from stan lee, excelsior!"
16113,Leonard,good night.
18045,Leonard,she really is.
18339,Leonard,"yeah, but sheldon and amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. they have each other for that. so, how was school?"
13310,Leonard,"why should i do something, you’re the one who introduced her to online gaming."
12470,Leonard,then he and i are on equal ground.
21304,Leonard,"come on, you know you’re not leaving physics. why are you doing this?"
19714,Leonard,of course.
14305,Leonard,"oh, sure, what’s up?"
12979,Leonard,that doesn’t sound too bad.
18140,Leonard,i don’t know. it’s a fat guy on a segway. that’s funny everywhere.
14105,Leonard,"excuse me, but what about me? why don’t i get a shot?"
13059,Leonard,"he’s the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes."
18332,Leonard,you know exactly what i’m talking about.
19645,Leonard,this is cool.
17138,Leonard,"well, hey, we’re grown-ups. we can still be friends."
15584,Leonard,"no, i think a doorknob has you stymied."
16245,Leonard,right.
20540,Leonard,"happy birthday, buddy."
12355,Leonard,really? that’s impressive.
20334,Leonard,"well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?"
14425,Leonard,"so, i can’t go."
15241,Leonard,i don’t want to talk about it.
20645,Leonard,"no, he’d be bat-man-bat."
16482,Leonard,and what?
15509,Leonard,"i’d suggest a lubricant, but i have a feeling you fell on some of that as well."
19806,Leonard,"that would be great, thank you."
21599,Leonard,"hey, sorry i couldn’t find a parking spot, how are you doing."
20693,Leonard,"oh, yes, you do. you know you have a weird brother-sister-elliott-e.t. relationship with him."
15533,Leonard,is somebody working on that?
17513,Leonard,that’s great. get out.
13711,Leonard,what’s that? really? right now?
15505,Leonard,wait a minute– a child? you never see this girl. you just e-mail and text and twitter. now you’re considering having a baby?
15408,Leonard,"believe it or not, he was worse when i met him."
18320,Leonard,this stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. i’m telling her i’m quitting.
12460,Leonard,come on.
18709,Leonard,"fine. i’m not sure you should have quit. but if you care so much what i think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?"
15285,Leonard,yeah?
14070,Leonard,i’m afraid so. you know the cashew chicken i get you monday nights?
17087,Leonard,"yeah, that sounds right."
19816,Leonard,"that’s pretty cool, sheldon."
12691,Leonard,"because…. uh, friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium."
19869,Leonard,i don’t think so.
18611,Leonard,"i’m telling you, sheldon cares for you more than you think."
12378,Leonard,"that was fun, lesley, thanks for including me. "
13489,Leonard,they’re gorgeous.
14632,Leonard,"no, no, nothing like that. the deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends."
14408,Leonard,"hang on, i know i don’t possess the tools of leadership, but i don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside."
21565,Leonard,you kept walking. i think you did.
17653,Leonard,"okay, i get it."
15848,Leonard,papaya?
19799,Leonard,"wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?"
16915,Leonard,"yes, i do. the only reason i went is because you wanted to see them, and i wanted to have sex. to this day, i can’t see a sandra bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused."
21551,Leonard,"oh, that would be great."
13412,Leonard,no.
13749,Leonard,"come on, it’s just a video game. and we suck at it."
15455,Leonard,"now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye."
21413,Leonard,bye.
18226,Leonard,"three, four months."
14298,Leonard,"yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience."
19241,Leonard,some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.
18152,Leonard,"well, then, tell your face."
18266,Leonard,"and, oh, that’s me getting rescued after i fell in."
19877,Leonard,what are you talking about?
16349,Leonard,"thank you, officer."
19768,Leonard,"fine, then tell me how i should be looking at it."
13727,Leonard,"oh, right, yeah, um, so, stephanie, here’s the thing. i really like you."
17351,Leonard,who you bringing?
15570,Leonard,i’ll be damned.
13406,Leonard,"sheldon, sit down."
14910,Leonard,i do.
17754,Leonard,"you’re right, you should go."
16778,Leonard,"no, regular."
15973,Leonard,"yeah, well, not necessary. we broke up again."
21325,Leonard,"aw, that used to work with sheldon."
17204,Leonard,i don’t care. i’m done.
13014,Leonard,"no, i needed to hear it."
13494,Leonard,why?
15359,Leonard,"oh, good. wasn’t sure it was coming across."
18633,Leonard,how you doing?
16016,Leonard,you can be aquaman.
17638,Leonard,"hello, boys."
18071,Leonard,"you know, when i first met howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, i sat in gum."
20770,Leonard,"oh, please don’t."
17751,Leonard,"i don’t know. it-it-it’s hard sometimes. everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if i’m standing right there. and they’re all taller than me. why is everyone taller than me? you know what, this is all in my head. it’s my problem, not yours."
20580,Leonard,"well, funny story. so, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…"
18636,Leonard,"oh, come on, no, that’s not what i meant."
21596,Leonard,"hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers."
12557,Leonard,maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend. 
16058,Leonard,"sheldon, i think this will work. let’s just try it my way."
18340,Leonard,you bought my mom’s book?
21163,Leonard,did you at least have a good flight down there?
21324,Leonard,"yes, he is."
15712,Leonard,"no, i’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar."
17017,Leonard,"sheldon, i got this."
13781,Leonard,"sorry, i’m sorry, i’m sorry! never mind, we’re cool."
16885,Leonard,cuddles?
20743,Leonard,"hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?"
18312,Leonard,i have asthma. back off.
19927,Leonard,i get it. smallville almost wrecked you.
14698,Leonard,"okay, yeah. i can see the difference."
15017,Leonard,that was amazing how you handled him.
15426,Leonard,"mm, joyce kim was kind of curious about what i did for a living, and i was going to kind of show it to her. it’s not important. the point is, the guys and i went back to the apartment."
19654,Leonard,why not?
20666,Leonard,not funny.
15829,Leonard,"c’mon raj, how am i supposed to know who she’s attracted to. or was attracted to. or who she might be attracted to. in the future."
16099,Leonard,"not you, him."
21442,Leonard,"i don’t know, you pretty much covered it."
17938,Leonard,how did i do that? i got to remember how i did that.
20907,Leonard,it’ll be fine. you’ll see. sheldon? buddy? 
15888,Leonard,"bet if i could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we’d still be together."
13845,Leonard,"yeah, i got the same one. and that’s not a bathing suit, it’s a tan line."
12545,Leonard,"so, we’ll just order three entrees."
18723,Leonard,"uh, fifteen…"
14552,Leonard,"in this case, you bet she is."
16049,Leonard,that is ridiculous.
16565,Leonard,no backsies.
19247,Leonard,thank you. and now i owe you one.
12251,Leonard,"i know what you’re thinking, i’ve taken your asthma into account. there’s a feline geneticist in san diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos. "
14380,Leonard,"you could have waited until morning. i know, look who i’m talking to."
12225,Leonard,"oh no, that’s probably not such a good idea. civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap. "
16126,Leonard,sure.
15252,Leonard,"okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. so, what do you want to say?"
17262,Leonard,"i’m sorry. so, listen, i heard something about him. can you keep it between us?"
12231,Leonard,"well, i’m done with penny. i’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed."
19072,Leonard,it’s not just that. my mother would kill me if i let something happen to him.
18516,Leonard,it’d actually be nice to not hear sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
17478,Leonard,how about our roof?
14385,Leonard,maybe.
13029,Leonard,"so, how do you two know each other."
12144,Leonard,"okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to  oh, you’re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. i guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves."
18983,Leonard,hmm.
21412,Leonard,"sure. you’re living here for free, i guess i owe you."
15462,Leonard,i’ll help you.
15221,Leonard,"wait, that’s it? i thought we had a whole hour!"
14524,Leonard,hey. what’s going on?
21411,Leonard,it’s cute that you think that. don’t worry about it.
21261,Leonard,"that’s great, i’m happy for you."
13848,Leonard,there was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. roommate wanted. whistlers need not apply.
14797,Leonard,the cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
19667,Leonard,"no, no. we cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing."
13372,Leonard,let’s just eat so i can get to bed. with any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
12998,Leonard,"don’t worry baby, i’ve got you."
19523,Leonard,"hey, we’re home. any progress?"
14302,Leonard,yes.
18582,Leonard,but it is what you got me last year.
15915,Leonard,yeah.
19392,Leonard,"if there was an asteroid strike, wouldn’t you die, too?"
16996,Leonard,it’s two a.m. what are you doing up?
16038,Leonard,"i was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. you just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!"
18338,Leonard,hey.
18599,Leonard,because i know exactly the kind of guy you would’ve ended up with.
19402,Leonard,"that’s funny. boy, i’m gonna miss these painkillers."
20159,Leonard,"wow. that, that was crazier than i thought."
15071,Leonard,how does that involve air travel?
19430,Leonard,congratulations.
13659,Leonard,good night.
14076,Leonard,"yeah, buddy?"
12217,Leonard,"dammit man, we’re dying here. "
16135,Leonard,really? triumphant?
21370,Leonard,"if you want to drive, just drive. i don’t see why this has to be so complicated."
21686,Leonard,you’re right. this is even weirder than i thought.
20882,Leonard,what is this?
17967,Leonard,wow. it sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together.
14223,Leonard,"don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them."
13130,Leonard,"okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that i need to know the details of your sex life, i just thought…. never mind. "
12518,Leonard,what’s wrong?
14674,Leonard,"sacks, sacks…"
20260,Leonard,"ah, i also made oatmeal."
19186,Leonard,i’ve seen him do it. it’s not romantic.
14653,Leonard,"maybe koothrappali’s right, maybe i embarrass her."
13891,Leonard,stop it!
13028,Leonard,"you too, swell, also."
18160,Leonard,that’s a big deal.
17344,Leonard,you pick up a y chromosome while you were there? you might be short one.
20958,Leonard,yeah. my record was six.
16398,Leonard,you don’t say?
13455,Leonard,the one with the little onions? mmm.
16930,Leonard,you’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because i said we weren’t on a date.
18836,Leonard,"let’s get this over with. am i driving you to the cheesecake factory, or are we having sex? i’m just, i’m trying to lighten the mood."
13939,Leonard,"you guys suck.  come on, please? he’s so big."
18530,Leonard,what?
17286,Leonard,why is there a hole here?
15607,Leonard,"yeah, not my point."
15529,Leonard,what’s there?
20399,Leonard,no.
18970,Leonard,"so, what did you think of your first funeral?"
17168,Leonard,"okay, bug report taken. next time i will have a better plan for our evening’s activity."
14544,Leonard,wow!
15029,Leonard,what?
21461,Leonard,you understood the math?
20139,Leonard,"look at all these activities the university has. rock climbing club, archery, flag football."
17798,Leonard,"okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you’re out of the game."
12829,Leonard,"graduate work, very impressive."
12398,Leonard,sheldon!
18408,Leonard,"well, i took you there. all you did was…"
21368,Leonard,"he wasn’t in a car, but okay."
13111,Leonard,"if i were you, i’d be more concerned by what they’re passing off as chicken. "
20126,Leonard,i hope so.
20272,Leonard,are we gonna be much longer? i really have to go to the bathroom.
18803,Leonard,"you’re right. i mean, he decides what tv shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. i wanted frodo, but we can’t both have frodo, so guess who’s stuck with samwise gamgee."
13469,Leonard,why?
14692,Leonard,"yeah, okay, like you said."
18304,Leonard,ha-ha.
19675,Leonard,"yeah. you get the paint, i’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this."
12516,Leonard,"she’s an enigma, raj. "
18910,Leonard,yeah.
19149,Leonard,"oh, that poor waiter."
21345,Leonard,"no. which will make me miserable, which is usually sheldon’s job."
20483,Leonard,"relax, there’s room for two babies in this group."
14506,Leonard,duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
17534,Leonard,i was. now i’m having a nightmare. what do you want?
19994,Leonard,"i don’t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. look, it’s not how i pictured it either, but i’m still glad we’re doing it."
18066,Leonard,"hey, how was your… what?"
12956,Leonard,where are your snipers?
18739,Leonard,"well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location."
13249,Leonard,why not?
19277,Leonard,"well, i think i came up with a pretty good solution."
15303,Leonard,what do you want?
13367,Leonard,terrific.
16803,Leonard,more halloween candy? didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
15372,Leonard,"i, um, i don’t follow."
17371,Leonard,why would you open mine?
21204,Leonard,"oh, no. good game."
18833,Leonard,"i’m so sorry. i know it’s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?"
19748,Leonard,i know. you want to get a picture?
15323,Leonard,all i’m saying is give me a heads-up.
19680,Leonard,"so, where do we want to hang it?"
12126,Leonard,our babies will be smart and beautiful.
19948,Leonard,"yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together."
18572,Leonard,sheldon.
14779,Leonard,better. thanks.
19114,Leonard,i don’t care.
15290,Leonard,very much.
17872,Leonard,"yes, but i think this is all a big misunderstanding."
13854,Leonard,"come on! there’s over 200 questions. and look at some of these things. sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?"
20911,Leonard,"i understand that we’re under contract, and i don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised."
16601,Leonard,"thanks, mother. i feel much better."
18047,Leonard,"yeah, well, it’s in our contract to serve on a university committee. and frankly, this is one i believe in. okay, here we go. encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences."
12096,Leonard,"a favour? sure, you can ask me a favour, i would do you a favour for you."
14222,Leonard,"you know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?"
13239,Leonard,"so, yeah, good to see you."
13782,Leonard,really? why would you say that?
15331,Leonard,aren’t you going to thank penny for taking you to disneyland?
12898,Leonard,"howard, sit down."
12964,Leonard,how are we going to get it upstairs? 
12423,Leonard,well what did she mean by that? was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention? 
14590,Leonard,you are a dirty girl.
20227,Leonard,"me neither, but what other choice do we have?"
13471,Leonard,i don’t know morse code.
12571,Leonard,"okay, now, do you really need the honorary justice league of america membership card?"
16830,Leonard,"oh, that’s not who i am."
19582,Leonard,"upon review, i’ve changed my mind about the cooper-hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. in fact, it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory. maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like cooper and hofstadter."
15583,Leonard,why? what’s the problem?
14895,Leonard,i don’t believe this. why am i the last to know?
16730,Leonard,"okay, fine. just the sword, two ten."
21721,Leonard,what?
19851,Leonard,"okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be."
19743,Leonard,"oh, that’s true. it’s not like we can get in there."
13495,Leonard,yes.
17175,Leonard,hey. you ready to go?
16182,Leonard,i won’t be too late. i’m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
20683,Leonard,"well, they argue all the time. they aren’t that close."
20908,Leonard,"um, i don’t really know how to say this."
13570,Leonard,"just say, leonard went to the office."
16152,Leonard,he’s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of god.
12322,Leonard,mahalo’s a nice touch. 
18205,Leonard,i draw my broadsword.
14200,Leonard,"well, dts has more low end, so… okay."
13777,Leonard,brilliant.
16726,Leonard,nope. maybe another time.
13377,Leonard,yes.
14950,Leonard,"well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind."
17802,Leonard,"i know, but when i shop online, i can do it on the toilet."
21545,Leonard,"instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that you’re a loving and supportive boyfriend."
21047,Leonard,do you know what you need to do now?
21674,Leonard,what?
13804,Leonard,"howard, where you going?"
13287,Leonard,right 
18088,Leonard,sheldon.
20768,Leonard,still get in.
13861,Leonard,then why learn how to swim?
16727,Leonard,two hundred.
20152,Leonard,"well, good. it’s nice to see your mind off amy."
18191,Leonard,you want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
15314,Leonard,you used to it yet?
15418,Leonard,"actually, i couldn’t get too mad at him about joyce kim."
18701,Leonard,of course i do. she’s a great actress. i’m proud she’s taking this risk.
20631,Leonard,"okay, you have every right to be mad. and what you said is true. you do make more money than me. so i had no right to do what i did. and i’m so sorry. i hope you can forgive me."
16510,Leonard,that’s actually my napkin.
16053,Leonard,okay. you need to get clear on this right now. i am in charge of this project.
19909,Leonard,keep walking.
14602,Leonard,i don’t know. what do you want me to do?
14752,Leonard,"okay, yeah, it’s true, but i can live with that stuff. what i can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!"
20706,Leonard,"the difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out."
16335,Leonard,"why does it have to be about anything? can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?"
15036,Leonard,"so, you’re going to go work at the patent office?"
21404,Leonard,"leonard and penny, i’m sorry for all the trouble i’ve caused. i went to stay at howard’s. ps cinnamon’s with me, but if you feel like messing with sheldon, tell him she’s loose in the building."
12794,Leonard,"oh, hi penny!"
15254,Leonard,"no, the place to have the conversation was in bed after i said, i love you, and you said, thank you, good night."
14147,Leonard,she’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.
12844,Leonard,"well, what are you going to do, sheldon, give up?"
20551,Leonard,"well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?"
14999,Leonard,"aye, aye, captain."
17863,Leonard,why? nothing is ever going to happen between me and alex.
16310,Leonard,she completely understood everything i said. case closed.
18816,Leonard,"well, we should call her."
17269,Leonard,can’t be very long.
17644,Leonard,"sheldon, i don’t think this actually means…"
15937,Leonard,"well, did you apologize? did you have to woo me?"
12287,Leonard,i can’t because if i don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you.
13041,Leonard,"onion dip, it’s onion dip. "
16243,Leonard,so don’t watch tv. read a book.
21749,Leonard,on occasion.
15825,Leonard,where did you get that?
12028,Leonard,"leonard, sheldon."
19751,Leonard,"okay, yeah. what do we have to lose? i’m a little nervous."
16652,Leonard,"so, how are your mom and dad?"
15226,Leonard,"uh-uh, give it a minute."
13562,Leonard,"yeah. listen, i have to kinda sneak out for a while."
15497,Leonard,"come on. we’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!"
16069,Leonard,because you’re impossible to work with.
18905,Leonard,are you sure you want to do this?
16134,Leonard,"in a word, triumphant."
18472,Leonard,"oh, uh, we played, once. i broke a window."
18149,Leonard,"oh, don’t say cute. that’s the worst."
16759,Leonard,ten.
20806,Leonard,i don’t know. he uses that traffic app. maybe there’s an accident.
18590,Leonard,"i, uh, ah, um, i…"
12399,Leonard,"wuh, i don’t…. th-th-th-that’s really two different questions, uh, i’m not…. sheldon, we have to go! "
21510,Leonard,"no, i told her she was being not smart. which was dumb."
16960,Leonard,i hate all of you and myself. three.
13995,Leonard,no.
13521,Leonard,we’re not encouraging. it’s more like knuckling under.
13719,Leonard,"and then the, the subject got changed somehow."
19640,Leonard,okay.
14131,Leonard,thank you.
17010,Leonard,"i’m doing okay, i guess."
21672,Leonard,‘sup?
20237,Leonard,when did we get a wall safe?
12185,Leonard,penny’s up.
14424,Leonard,"yes, okay, but i’m gonna be gone for three months. what if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?"
15655,Leonard,hey.
17538,Leonard,"yes, you walked around for a week saying, sheldon unhappy with casting choice."
13319,Leonard,"penny, you’ve got cheetos in your hair."
21137,Leonard,"well, for me, too. it’s not the same with you gone."
15849,Leonard,guava?
17705,Leonard,"well, i spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection."
14319,Leonard,yes.
12755,Leonard,yeah! funny how things work out. 
20197,Leonard,"uh, yeah, uh, right here."
17488,Leonard,"mm-hmm, international space station. 250 miles that way."
13243,Leonard,you went out and bought linen?
19018,Leonard,then what do you need?
17884,Leonard,yeah.
21649,Leonard,25 cats!
12135,Leonard,"so, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system."
12188,Leonard,"yes, but, only to clean."
21416,Leonard,"i understand it, sheldon."
13090,Leonard,no.
20861,Leonard,don’t speak.
15536,Leonard,thank you.
16923,Leonard,"are you sure? because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries."
15420,Leonard,"as it turns out, she was a north korean spy. luckily, sheldon drove her out before i revealed anything important. which i’m not saying i would have."
16787,Leonard,"okay. i don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. she’s all the way in india. that would be great."
20243,Leonard,"oh, man, i’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you."
14597,Leonard,what are you doing here?
20506,Leonard,"you want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
14025,Leonard,"no, that shouldn’t be a problem, venus is up during the day. they’re probably just all staring at the sky."
13633,Leonard,huh? would it work if i just punched you in the face?
12442,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, there’s something i want to talk to you about before we go to the party."
16298,Leonard,yeah.
17862,Leonard,i’m sorry. i just never think of you having feelings like that.
14758,Leonard,"the brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t."
18331,Leonard,"well, why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a, i can’t even say it in front of sheldon."
19578,Leonard,"okay, okay. uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. i wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish."
17403,Leonard,"hey, i got to hand it to raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party."
17155,Leonard,"excuse me, sorry, excuse me."
20939,Leonard,i feel like i pulled something. why didn’t you tell me to stop?
21658,Leonard,"oh, yeah, i’m feeling it."
13846,Leonard,oh he’s trying to make a new friend.
16876,Leonard,why do i have to talk to penny? she’s not my girlfriend.
19574,Leonard,no.
19642,Leonard,what’s that?
17894,Leonard,i’ll set the timer.
16812,Leonard,you’re very talented. this is really good. did you do… 
20318,Leonard,is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?
12034,Leonard,should we have invited her for lunch?
15564,Leonard,i am looking at you.
17383,Leonard,still going to introduce him?
17294,Leonard,what are you talking about?
17500,Leonard,"i got all your favourites. beer, wings, sliders. we can watch the football game. i even painted my stomach."
15197,Leonard,"oh, i’m so glad you asked it like that. you."
18886,Leonard,ps4.
13359,Leonard,a lackey?
16489,Leonard,sorry.
12481,Leonard,a homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
17927,Leonard,shouldn’t we talk to him? have you learned nothing in six years?
12903,Leonard,"no, i meant…. never mind. hey, check it out. i got you a batman cookie jar!"
14882,Leonard,i just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than i do.
14505,Leonard,i don’t know
18148,Leonard,"so, did you love it? of course you loved it. how could you not love it? tell me how much you loved it."
17107,Leonard,you’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.
16972,Leonard,yeah.
15007,Leonard,"so roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?"
17948,Leonard,"what is wrong with you? if i did that, you’d bitch about it for weeks."
20997,Leonard,"well, she moved in across the hall."
12035,Leonard,we already watched the season two dvds.
13523,Leonard,you can recognize people on google earth?
21503,Leonard,"she’s doing amazing. she can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success."
13392,Leonard,i’m not going to work.
21753,Leonard,shh. just pretend we’re not here.
18030,Leonard,"come on, buddy, open up."
21159,Leonard,"oh, like halley’s comet."
19978,Leonard,"‘cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. let’s give them hope."
14559,Leonard,"no, this has to stop now."
13858,Leonard,"what i’m trying to say is that, maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise."
12180,Leonard,i’m not surprised. a well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.
12812,Leonard,alright  i just hit my head. 
20002,Leonard,this is it.
19959,Leonard,"remember, uh, a couple years back when i was on that research ship in the north sea?"
19267,Leonard,"aw, oh, thank you. that is so sweet."
19827,Leonard,we could be betas. they’re second in charge.
19989,Leonard,penny’s on the phone with her.
13810,Leonard,"no, don’t make it so. barry, we can’t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated."
19088,Leonard,i’m gonna miss you.
13062,Leonard,"sheldon, you are really being unreasonable. "
21147,Leonard,"okay, i can breathe again. babe, they want to have sex."
21501,Leonard,"i have sheldon, that keeps most people away."
12834,Leonard,what are you talking about? 
13493,Leonard,what are you doing?
15128,Leonard,nope.
12798,Leonard,"oh dammit, my glasses. okay, i’m blind here guys, can you help me find them?"
19638,Leonard,hmm. i can honestly say penny.
21253,Leonard,"oh. yeah. okay, sure. what’s going on with your brother?"
18779,Leonard,great. what did you do?
20077,Leonard,"i’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. but the good news is that i’m pretty sure i know why."
18852,Leonard,i’ve seen old pictures of you. you were never a fat kid.
14172,Leonard,one-day rush. i really need to take that off the web site.
15653,Leonard,"no, i can’t eat melon."
14263,Leonard,yes
15594,Leonard,this is ridiculous. you’re just making stuff up.
14777,Leonard,"stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
18837,Leonard,sorry.
20620,Leonard,a scientist made that.
16623,Leonard,of course i like amy.
13715,Leonard,thank you.
15633,Leonard,zazzles?
19901,Leonard,we just spent two hours in traffic. did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?
16708,Leonard,"yeah, every night for the last month."
19534,Leonard,"because it is what you want, and it’s not what you said."
20234,Leonard,how long have you known adam?
21433,Leonard,yeah.
13023,Leonard,sheldon’s office? is she lost? 
19564,Leonard,when did my idea become our idea?
18612,Leonard,"hang on, i’m gonna give you a little early christmas present. i’m gonna show you something, but if you ever told sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again. so, if you want to tell him, that’s fine. look."
16750,Leonard,you want to drive?
15609,Leonard,so we already have you for all that.
16127,Leonard,no. why do you ask?
17089,Leonard,"so, polly, tell me about yourself."
18193,Leonard,it’s gonna get crazy.
13801,Leonard,killer robot. we built it.
13129,Leonard,actually it’s not all that easy to find. 
18425,Leonard,yeah. it must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.
13349,Leonard,"we’re here to see koothrappali, not kill batman."
18664,Leonard,really not a good time.
17342,Leonard,uh-uh.
15305,Leonard,sheldon!
16744,Leonard,"you never stop talking, do you?"
17808,Leonard,"you’re ten seconds away from getting crushed. nine, eight."
12743,Leonard,i’ve got a solution.
17097,Leonard,"i’m sorry, what did i say?"
15925,Leonard,penny kissed me.
13555,Leonard,no one’s a scientist like howard.
16395,Leonard,an arrow.
15846,Leonard,"hey, you got snoopy out. can i have a snowcone?"
16578,Leonard,i live here.
19436,Leonard,"you shut the loading doors, right?"
12128,Leonard,"there you go, pad thai, no peanuts."
13974,Leonard,yes.
16136,Leonard,"i don’t know, i kind of promised howard."
16908,Leonard,are we overthinking this?
15126,Leonard,"you have no idea who he is, do you?"
12241,Leonard,"there is a generally accepted pattern in this area, i would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of hugh grant or sandra bullock. "
19083,Leonard,"no, he looks like a grown man. you’ve seen freaky friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies."
21604,Leonard,"…thing and honest but, it’s no big deal…"
12037,Leonard,"well, then that was wrong of us. we need to widen our circle."
15567,Leonard,that’s how i’m going to make it look.
12748,Leonard,"yeah, i got it, sheldon, why?"
15586,Leonard,i think it is.
16446,Leonard,"i can’t hear you, i’m in the shower."
20793,Leonard,"uh, i don’t, any day now."
12330,Leonard,sounds yummy. i look forward to your work with bacon.
16651,Leonard,"no, no! no-no-no! the screen froze. it’s probably just buffering, just give it a second."
16816,Leonard,no. lactose. gas.
21745,Leonard,fine. i’ll take it.
15547,Leonard,have you had your appendix out?
20458,Leonard,what? why?
19160,Leonard,some perfect couple. he won’t even share his food with her.
19470,Leonard,"well, i’d like to be green, but you know you always take it."
17818,Leonard,"no, it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. pretty christmassy."
13441,Leonard,"no, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out."
16696,Leonard,not bad. i had a lot more fun with amy than i thought i would.
15033,Leonard,what are you talking about?
20730,Leonard,"i have to admit, i’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this."
20155,Leonard,"look, even if it’s not him, amy’s probably going to date someone at some point."
13492,Leonard,"sheldon, the food’s here."
18449,Leonard,sheldon.
18717,Leonard,"oh, i’ve got butterflies."
21246,Leonard,and you think we can get those guys to reprogram sheldon? cool.
16964,Leonard,you know what? never mind. i’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.
19985,Leonard,amy broke up with sheldon.
20004,Leonard,we’re good.
13171,Leonard,thank you. you look very nice.
18303,Leonard,it’s not funny.
14576,Leonard,what’s he on trial for?
14436,Leonard,"hey, guys, can i just say something? how about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? this is literally the top of the world. only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see."
19293,Leonard,"not a problem. i grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it’s what i think love looks like."
16596,Leonard,what’s going on? what do you want?
12932,Leonard,what the hell is that.
15395,Leonard,we’ll all be naked in front of each other.
13072,Leonard,"oh. you have other plans, or…?"
13965,Leonard,"okay, bye. my mother’s coming to visit."
12232,Leonard,i don’t know. olivia geiger?
20244,Leonard,you did go pfft.
12077,Leonard,the worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
14962,Leonard,what about me?
12923,Leonard,we are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
13005,Leonard,i paid two hundred dollars for my share.
19560,Leonard,i earned this. back off.
21516,Leonard,hi.
18384,Leonard,"although, technically, indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. he couldn’t even get that done."
14108,Leonard,"she’s probably heard every possible line, howard. why don’t you just try hello?"
12966,Leonard,"come on, guys, push. "
20356,Leonard,"yeah. no matter what happens, we’re coming back tomorrow to watch it again."
18963,Leonard,"yeah, we won’t be eating arthur tonight."
21299,Leonard,"it’s just a theory. uh, it’s not even worked out."
13386,Leonard,and mythological.
17338,Leonard,"i don’t know, maybe that you’d be a little upset, and then you’d realize that i’m a stallion that has to run free. and that would turn you on a little."
20014,Leonard,"thank you. finally, there’s a mrs. hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me."
17264,Leonard,i never know what to do in these situations. should i give him a heads-up?
20435,Leonard,did it?
16008,Leonard,see?
16789,Leonard,hang on. looks like everyone’s a winner.
21390,Leonard,"yeah, for a little while."
15377,Leonard,i didn’t betray penny.
15613,Leonard,i think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the shamy could go on for years.
18848,Leonard,what do you mean it’s too late?
20430,Leonard,still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
17289,Leonard,what happened?
20988,Leonard,that’ll be four seventy-five.
17586,Leonard,no.
20598,Leonard,"so, these are for you, and if you’re not too mad, we’d love to take you guys to dinner."
19107,Leonard,thanks again for coming. six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.
16718,Leonard,"well, they don’t have an excalibur here, so what do you want to do?"
17942,Leonard,"all right, we’re down the rabbit hole. what are you doing?"
20849,Leonard,there goes our big payday.
17188,Leonard,thank you for hiding my star wars socks at the emergency room. is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
13400,Leonard,"oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out."
16788,Leonard,here.
19740,Leonard,making great time. gonna be there pretty early.
17145,Leonard,"well, i was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. that was the plan, right?"
14477,Leonard,will you please take that stupid hat off?
14771,Leonard,"oh, hey. dune."
17846,Leonard,"i don’t know, just having a good day. this morning sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so i got to listen to the radio. that was pretty crazy."
16460,Leonard,not as much as you.
17189,Leonard,"so, are we still taking things slow? because a gunshot wound today, last week, i slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. we don’t know how much time i have."
13661,Leonard,thank you.
13536,Leonard,he can never know that i gave that to you.
20978,Leonard,"yeah. wow, an appearance by george lucas… ‘s dermatologist. oh, i want that autograph."
13799,Leonard,that’ll do it.
15162,Leonard,how is this maritime salvage?
15619,Leonard,"oh, no."
20470,Leonard,of course.
12475,Leonard,"no, i’m a hobbit."
16931,Leonard,"come on, he’s not that cute."
20890,Leonard,what?
12491,Leonard,so why was he at your party?
18922,Leonard,sure. what’s up?
18578,Leonard,"all right, here’s the deal. sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window."
13724,Leonard,"nothing, just rethinking my whole life. okay, here’s the thing, i’m afraid that if i ask her to move out, she’ll just dump me."
20835,Leonard,"fine, then you go."
18776,Leonard,yeah.
18089,Leonard,amy.
12666,Leonard,you cannot possibly be that arrogant.
15557,Leonard,"well, okay, with the indian food, the pizza, the thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars."
20208,Leonard,will you stop with that already?
21517,Leonard,that doesn’t seem to be where i shine. how about i just give you one of these?
15208,Leonard,i thought i could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
19810,Leonard,"okay. well, you kids have fun. i’m gonna go to sleep."
19689,Leonard,so what’s the problem?
18675,Leonard,did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
20198,Leonard,"what ya doing, skippy?"
12229,Leonard,"no, i’m not jealous, i’m just a little concerned for her. i didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with."
13914,Leonard,you’ve had an acting job where you got paid?
16420,Leonard,i heard about it from sheldon. he got it from amy.
19804,Leonard,"wil, i’m begging you, just please turn that off."
18250,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s not a great time, what do you want?"
16663,Leonard,okay. wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?
14657,Leonard,hey.
19128,Leonard,hey. we just wanted to see how your class was going. where is everybody?
18172,Leonard,yes.
21153,Leonard,it’s hard to believe howard’s having a kid.
17570,Leonard,"oh, seti, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. you should introduce him to sheldon. the search is over."
20887,Leonard,"oh, it’s complicated. he finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine"
18002,Leonard,"no, tell me."
21532,Leonard,are you implementing phase two?
18489,Leonard,"well, i don’t know how to do that."
20441,Leonard,you don’t sound very excited about it.
15824,Leonard,"oh, god."
14440,Leonard,check.
17239,Leonard,"really. who do you think did that, sheldon?"
21668,Leonard,"you call that a glow stick? that is a glow stick. come on, let’s go."
20705,Leonard,i’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
20805,Leonard,is that howard in front of us?
15072,Leonard,no.
16736,Leonard,"sheldon, can you grab me a water?"
12416,Leonard,wha… how did it get on the internet?
21418,Leonard,"oh, sure. wait, nancy?"
21547,Leonard,thank you.
17908,Leonard,"okay, he gets how cool it is."
21344,Leonard,"we don’t know, his mother never had him tested."
17493,Leonard,where do you stand on it? 
14015,Leonard,i don’t know. foreplay?
13345,Leonard,come on.
15112,Leonard,"not really, i’m just an enthusiast."
18903,Leonard,women. who knows what’ll set ’em off?
13207,Leonard,"what do you mean, you’re moving out? why? "
20166,Leonard,we should let you guys talk.
15348,Leonard,"hi-lo. oops. i started to say hi, and then i switched to hello in the middle. it came out hi-lo. duh. uh, it’s nice to meet you. i’ve read both your books and most of your papers. i’m leonard, i live"
17564,Leonard,given her what?
20878,Leonard,we only have two months to deliver this to the air force because of you.
17248,Leonard,lobster traps?
15498,Leonard,i’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.
20667,Leonard,"oh, of course, because i’m the only adult around here."
12245,Leonard,thank you. . shall i count down from three?
14794,Leonard,he struck out.
21614,Leonard,a-a-a-aw!
19408,Leonard,look at these notebooks. they’re full of pages and pages of data. he clearly spent years on this.
13401,Leonard,i just got here.
21742,Leonard,"uh, i guess."
21218,Leonard,thank you.
13618,Leonard,he’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.
12365,Leonard,"lesley, this is penny, she lives across the hall from sheldon and me. "
16989,Leonard,i don’t know.
20236,Leonard,"my brother was mean to me, too."
20086,Leonard,what is this?
20992,Leonard,why do you do that? can’t you let me have my moment?
18521,Leonard,"penny, you know those are real, right?"
14642,Leonard,approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. approaching them does.
15506,Leonard,still digging the shamy?
12727,Leonard,"oh, well, thankyou."
19747,Leonard,wasn’t even that hard to find.
18353,Leonard,"of course, who am i to argue with a check-plus student? just warning you, i’m gonna go right. don’t make a big deal out of it."
13631,Leonard,excuse me. what the hell is wrong with you?
18055,Leonard,"guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game"
17223,Leonard,"fine, what is it?"
12018,Leonard,no.
19491,Leonard,"i don’t know, but the girls do a lot for us. it’s the least we can do."
21063,Leonard,"that’s sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of bert, too."
13824,Leonard,she’s a delightful woman. you’ll love her.
18690,Leonard,"so, well, before making any rash…"
12090,Leonard,i’m not anticipating coitus.
18943,Leonard,"oh, doesn’t seem like it. she got sheldon to go to a psychic with her."
14686,Leonard,i’m sorry?
21484,Leonard,"it’s totally different. bert’s money might run out, but i can beg until the end of time."
16633,Leonard,"i did it last night, i’m not doing it again."
18182,Leonard,"actually, he’s a genius."
16513,Leonard,water nymph.
12774,Leonard,i mix pancake batter in this! 
12675,Leonard,"stop, stop it, quit it. "
18231,Leonard,okay. i’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
15857,Leonard,"don’t be ridiculous, raj. you’re here legally."
14899,Leonard,then why are you telling me?
18157,Leonard,"the harmony one was fine. we didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand."
20291,Leonard,baby.
14173,Leonard,davy crockett. jiminy crockett was a cricket.
21646,Leonard,"oh, so the dialogue offends you?"
15364,Leonard,"morning, sheldon."
19960,Leonard,"okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on."
14730,Leonard,"i don’t want to play a game, sheldon."
15276,Leonard,"sheldon, i got you your tangerine chicken. i hope you’re hungry."
17545,Leonard,"oh. yeah, okay."
21422,Leonard,i’d still like to know who jerry is.
20499,Leonard,you may have actually just come up with something.
18789,Leonard,"i know you don’t like change, but it’s not a terrible idea."
14357,Leonard,"hey, stuart, i need to talk to you."
18968,Leonard,"the toys were holding hands in a furnace. look, arthur lived a full life. and he inspired a lot of people. sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that i got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift."
17923,Leonard,"aw, and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one. look at my face. do i look smug? i feel smug."
15196,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, i was up in the administration office, and i happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s chancellor’s award for science."
12695,Leonard,so?
21295,Leonard,"four thousand dollars, worth every penny."
17273,Leonard,"h-h-h-hang on, howard. barry, how good of a shot are you?"
19961,Leonard,"okay, um, well, there was this girl."
16558,Leonard,you? sure. bring as many as you want.
18238,Leonard,yeah.
16288,Leonard,"um, not great, i guess. but penny and i are just friends."
18926,Leonard,you made fun of us. said it was stupid.
14261,Leonard,yes
19301,Leonard,what? why didn’t you say that first?
13272,Leonard,yes.
19132,Leonard,hmm. you’re up late.
14501,Leonard,"no, we went somewhere new."
13937,Leonard,well?
20774,Leonard,"buddy, let it go."
19064,Leonard,"anyway, as i was saying, sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘cause that’s important. not just for him, but for most anybody, really."
18046,Leonard,"look, i know you guys don’t want to do this, but we have no choice. so, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with."
16255,Leonard,yeah?
18575,Leonard,where?
18747,Leonard,a little.
16107,Leonard,"yeah, it is a little like getting into dracula’s coffin."
12901,Leonard,why do they say aa? 
20277,Leonard,"well, we’re having everyone over."
13061,Leonard,"we all make mistakes, let’s move on. "
19548,Leonard,"well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own."
12133,Leonard,no.
17334,Leonard,i’d make fun of sheldon for having girl problems if i wasn’t in shock that sheldon has girl problems.
17361,Leonard,awesome!
19836,Leonard,the flower dies.
15941,Leonard,see? he doesn’t mind.
14474,Leonard,i can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
17960,Leonard,"well, i’ve had it. i am done. i can’t, i can’t live with him for one more minute."
14727,Leonard,"i heard of ’em. didn’t know they were a band. sheldon, she’s gone. you can turn off the blender."
14320,Leonard,about what?
13946,Leonard,"okay, here it is. penny’s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems."
13424,Leonard,so what is it you’re doing?
19803,Leonard,why would i have a guy? i don’t have any money.
14190,Leonard,"yeah, it is."
12598,Leonard,"we all know the reason. sheldon, what are you getting at?"
13916,Leonard,"nothing? it sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour."
16330,Leonard,it is pretty spicy.
16001,Leonard,"i don’t know, i think we might owe the guy an apology."
16144,Leonard,s-y-f-y. sy-fee.
16846,Leonard,"no, no, no. i, i can’t do this. believe me, i really want to."
15236,Leonard,seriously? you have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
19790,Leonard,"no, no, no. we’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation."
19765,Leonard,we understand. thank you so much.
19997,Leonard,you’re right. i’m sorry. we have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. so what do you think? should we run next door and grab a bite?
13180,Leonard,"well, good night. "
16346,Leonard,"oh, my god, what did they get?"
12820,Leonard,w-wait! 
20918,Leonard,you just shaved yesterday. you’re good for three months.
19811,Leonard,"yeah, i’m good."
13157,Leonard,really?
18933,Leonard,aw. what’s wrong with her?
14042,Leonard,there’s a chance.
15206,Leonard,"we can help you. we can be your team. like, uh, professor xavier and his x-men."
19145,Leonard,baseball.
16559,Leonard,just not against their will.
18855,Leonard,"oh, does the gazelle know that according to harlan ellison, it was not ripped off from demon with a glass hand, but was ripped off from another outer limits script he wrote called the soldier?"
17591,Leonard,"oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? oh, oh, a hot dog."
20473,Leonard,midnight. really? you know what? let’s do it.
17778,Leonard,that should lighten the mood.
19281,Leonard,what?
14971,Leonard,"yes, we are. and we’re about to go to bed."
18197,Leonard,"see, howard’s just as good a dungeon master as i am."
18802,Leonard,"i know, but…"
14159,Leonard,uh-huh. look at the comments.
21355,Leonard,"don’t worry, we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway. it’s like an all-night party. there’s trivia contests and dungeons & dragons. as we like to say, it’s off the chain mail."
19584,Leonard,somebody else do it.
15724,Leonard,there you go.
19213,Leonard,penny is not the reason i didn’t pursue that idea.
19428,Leonard,sad?
12332,Leonard,okay. i’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
19197,Leonard,and are you gonna use candy to lure them in?
17132,Leonard,what?
15190,Leonard,i’m out.
14426,Leonard,you really think so?
19860,Leonard,how would i be blinded?
18786,Leonard,moo-stache.
13153,Leonard,what about if you went out with me?
17369,Leonard,it’s broken.
13003,Leonard,just… personal reasons. 
17311,Leonard,i think this could be good for you. maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit.
21479,Leonard,"wow, that’s a big step."
17916,Leonard,"yeah, so, i’m out."
16130,Leonard,"oh, sheldon changed the password. it’s now penny is a freeloader. no spaces."
15373,Leonard,"well, now…"
18594,Leonard,"no, i am he. uh, any, anyway, um, there’s been something i’ve wanted to ask you for a long time. um."
20859,Leonard,yes.
21126,Leonard,"uh, can i help you?"
19847,Leonard,"great. now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it."
12828,Leonard,that is a problem. 
12886,Leonard,the needs of the many.
17486,Leonard,"no, come on in. hurry."
16892,Leonard,not really.
18095,Leonard,"yeah, cool."
21077,Leonard,"i couldn’t just take the compliment. i had to ask why. you know, i do understand what you’re feeling. my brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head."
14238,Leonard,"gee, thanks a lot."
12765,Leonard,you’d better go before he starts spraying you with lysol. 
18549,Leonard,"well, you’re about to be in an even better one. i didn’t want to say anything until i knew for sure, but, i’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and i disproved it. your element does not exist."
19337,Leonard,just hang on.
14732,Leonard,and then i say one little thing and i end up being the bad guy!
12562,Leonard,"sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask howard to choose between sex and halo."
17852,Leonard,what?
17728,Leonard,"none of this matters. i trust that penny cares about me, and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy."
18051,Leonard,"you mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?"
18988,Leonard,"hey. penny, don’t get upset. here. i love you, but, no, i will not marry you."
14267,Leonard,"no. look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted."
12869,Leonard,"sure. if he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat white russians, while you’re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you. "
14737,Leonard,"hang on. they’re showing a new digital print of time bandits, you wouldn’t want to come, would you?"
16022,Leonard,what makes you think i can convince her?
14766,Leonard,always is a long time. sure. always.
13470,Leonard,we are communicating through the wall.
12776,Leonard,huh. i guess i owe the betty crocker company a letter of apology. 
19420,Leonard,"well, that’s it. that’s the end of roger abbott."
14704,Leonard,"i don’t want to fly kites, sheldon. we’re watching football here."
20061,Leonard,what?
12364,Leonard,hey lesley. 
14339,Leonard,"yeah, it’s a regular manhattan project. what’s up?"
16207,Leonard,"hey, what’s up?"
12962,Leonard,"yeah, i know, i still can’t afford it. "
16893,Leonard,star wars on blu-ray.
21571,Leonard,our pleasure.
14728,Leonard,"no, we just had a little spat."
19581,Leonard,"sheldon, my name’s on that paper, too. there’s no upside to doing this."
18397,Leonard,i thought amy was gonna drive you home.
13829,Leonard,not yet.
16365,Leonard,"come on, help me out. am i in trouble?"
14970,Leonard,mm-hmm.
18806,Leonard,"hey, all set. what do you think? there’s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window."
19649,Leonard,here it is. there’s a black light.
21185,Leonard,you want to decorate it tonight?
19784,Leonard,"hey, great."
12060,Leonard,"yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in klingon. that’s probably enough about us, tell us about you."
17736,Leonard,that’s the name of his gang. the scientists. they are crazy.
15231,Leonard,good. glad is good.
21277,Leonard,"oh, you’re his little girl, he can’t stay mad at you."
17031,Leonard,really?
19150,Leonard,you don’t even like yorkshire pudding.
12435,Leonard,is there a theme?
14286,Leonard,"okay, i hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, i’m pretty sure she is a prostitute."
20962,Leonard,and who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?
13648,Leonard,"what? no. no, that’s not right."
20320,Leonard,"eh, that just means going barefoot."
15681,Leonard,"right, right. so you’re still just texting and emailing? you don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?"
12221,Leonard,excuse me.
21046,Leonard,over my assless chaps you will.
20772,Leonard,"boy, i wish i could say no."
15691,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m just not dating someone right now. i don’t need to go to a senior centre."
16094,Leonard,i think her weekend just opened up.
18649,Leonard,"and to show you how much i believe in you, i kind of got you an audition."
18452,Leonard,"hey, i got an email from professor proton."
18946,Leonard,really?
19378,Leonard,"if it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?"
13510,Leonard,congratulations. you’re officially one of us.
17156,Leonard,sorry. i’m having dinner with penny. i have to get out of here.
13353,Leonard,sheldon!
18488,Leonard,when i broke my arm i used to stick a coat hanger down there. you ever try that? maybe go in through the ear?
16952,Leonard,really?
12101,Leonard,which is?
21426,Leonard,"anyway, i figured i can hang out with my friends and have fun, too."
21421,Leonard,i went to your office christmas party?
19853,Leonard,"what about when we went to comic-con and dressed like jabba the hutt? you got to be jabba’s head, and i got to be his fat slug butt."
12917,Leonard,we can’t ask leslie winkle.
16278,Leonard,th-th-th-that’s okay. i can infer from context.
14670,Leonard,great.
13148,Leonard,"already, that was quick."
21651,Leonard,who is it?
15674,Leonard,"oh, god, what’s that smell? . oh-ho-hoo!"
17901,Leonard,"come on, let’s just start walking. there’s got to be a gas station or something nearby."
13964,Leonard,"aren’t there any other options? there’s not a lot of room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable."
13669,Leonard,"she’s heard about you because we’re, you know, involved and you haven’t heard about her because… i never slept with her, i swear!"
18935,Leonard,what ails her?
20185,Leonard,he handed you the box directly and called you stretch.
21574,Leonard,"exactly half. let’s push. okay, see, it’s moving, this is easy, all in the math. "
15439,Leonard,"relax, it’s just a dirty sock."
14975,Leonard,did we win? can we go to bed?
17819,Leonard,"come on, sheldon. you know all the christmas stories, and the carols, you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. just admit it. you’re getting a little yuletide spirit."
12783,Leonard,drink whatever you want.
17466,Leonard,i played that pretty well. 
20641,Leonard,"oh, yes."
21652,Leonard,we’re going to have to be very quiet.
18486,Leonard,how about that? sheldon’s being reasonable.
16157,Leonard,"mrs. latham, the first machine i turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, ’cause it needs to warm up."
20664,Leonard,why are you taking his side?
14404,Leonard,a little bit.
20635,Leonard,"uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. i have money i love, but never spend. we’re kind of a cute couple that way. again, i’m sorry. i shouldn’t have kept it a secret."
12006,Leonard,excuse me?
12082,Leonard,that’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that i wouldn’t participate. however briefly.
14861,Leonard,"when we watch frosty the snowman, he roots for the sun."
17413,Leonard,"so, howard wolowitz tying the knot. leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. he was a wild one. well, i guess we all kind of were. i remember this one time, i was with this girl at the beach. we were in the ocean and we started making out. i know, it was crazy. i wasn’t even wearing my aquasocks. then…"
18141,Leonard,"you know, if you’re trying to make space on the dvr, why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? like, um, alphas."
17100,Leonard,"so, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. this isn’t working out, but i’ll always have feelings for you. i’m sorry i slept with your best friend, but i’ll always have feelings for you. here’s the thing, lisa, i’m into dudes now, but i’ll always have feelings for you."
14958,Leonard,and why is that?
13395,Leonard,"didn’t i tell you i’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements."
14842,Leonard,what are you talking about?
19338,Leonard,"oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at benihana last night."
17402,Leonard,"you know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their s.a.t.’s."
20285,Leonard,"you don’t know my birthday, do you?"
12914,Leonard,"guys, let’s remember that sheldon is still our friend and my room mate."
13288,Leonard,"hey, why don’t we all move over there so leslie can join us."
12559,Leonard,"aaah, for god’s sake, sheldon, you are driving me crazy. "
16646,Leonard,all rightie. shirt coming off. ta-da! man nipples.
17952,Leonard,"that’s it. i don’t, i don’t have to put up with this."
17696,Leonard,"they’d say, why does he touch himself so much?"
20685,Leonard,"i try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out."
20765,Leonard,"hey, how’d it go?"
20116,Leonard,"it’s just where i need them. you know, she doesn’t have a lot of closet space."
20100,Leonard,"sheldon, can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? it’s like the batmobile. if batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool."
13761,Leonard,i’m not indoorsy. i just wear the appropriate sun block because i don’t take melanoma lightly.
19982,Leonard,why not?
15914,Leonard,listen to me. you are over-tired. you’re not thinking right. put the movie back before we get into trouble.
14167,Leonard,"yeah, no. but, sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail."
17231,Leonard,"that we go back to the way things were. but when i do something for you, you show a little appreciation."
16488,Leonard,"uh, sure. very… prominent."
16391,Leonard,what are you doing?
16914,Leonard,i hate those movies.
19475,Leonard,"no, no, no, come on, don’t leave. just try it."
19921,Leonard,wow. when does that start?
21338,Leonard,"oh, you brought your own lunch. good for you."
20064,Leonard,"so, um, i’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat."
15658,Leonard,"that covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. oh, my god. you ran over a hobo."
17978,Leonard,"i’m sorry, sheldon. i can’t help you. oh, spoiler alert, this door’s about to slam in your face."
20513,Leonard,i’ll check his room.
20141,Leonard,"i got a triple-word score with a double letter q. if that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what’s the point of having one? hey, barry kripke started a fencing club."
12356,Leonard,"hey, how did it go?"
13677,Leonard,how could i not be sure?
15764,Leonard,did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
13693,Leonard,"oh, no. i wish you’d told me that sooner."
20170,Leonard,"oh, well, that kind of stinks."
19824,Leonard,"i get it. uh, just this morning, sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my grape-nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict."
14951,Leonard,"no, not at all. let me help you with this stuff."
19896,Leonard,"see, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around sheldon’s mom?"
18821,Leonard,"well, it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby."
21265,Leonard,fine. you invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for god knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first.
17677,Leonard,"no, i assumed it would be good. then i read it."
16371,Leonard,no one’s getting tortured.
21664,Leonard,"mrs. cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?"
12233,Leonard,yeah.
14599,Leonard,"uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but penny and i occasionally need some alone time."
18650,Leonard,the new star wars movie.
13840,Leonard,"alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes."
15852,Leonard,what does that have to do with me and women?
18101,Leonard,"excuse me, but i think i’m just as qualified as you are."
17589,Leonard,how could you miss that?
19925,Leonard,can it wait until i put a band-aid on a goat bite?
21164,Leonard,"and before our next drive to comic-con, i need the name of that juice."
17141,Leonard,i’m just making a point.
15964,Leonard,"oh, hey. there’s been something i’ve been meaning to tell you."
12853,Leonard,"okay, sheldon, i understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but i need to tell you something and i want you to listen carefully. "
17271,Leonard,you just called dibs.
20133,Leonard,"buddy, i know me moving in with penny feels like a big change, but it’s not."
13775,Leonard,"that’s funny. by the way, my leg is killing me. thanks for asking."
21296,Leonard,colonel williams. sir.
13178,Leonard,"oh, right, no, i’m lactose intolerant."
19303,Leonard,may i ask why?
15195,Leonard,never!
18295,Leonard,great. 
20080,Leonard,i don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. why would i want to be with someone like me?
17943,Leonard,now you know how i feel when i have to put it on you.
13927,Leonard,"hey, what’s going on?"
17042,Leonard,what was i supposed to do? he needed a place to sleep it off.
15459,Leonard,"no, thanks."
16982,Leonard,i have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.
18437,Leonard,"it’s true, i did. i did say that. when we were at the used bookstore together and i saw the first edition and i bought it."
13767,Leonard,"no, just neighbours."
18394,Leonard,smart. take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding raj’s hair.
18207,Leonard,"all right, amy, there’s one ogre left. take him out."
21082,Leonard,"oh, i laughed so hard, i burst a blood vessel in my nose. it’s fine."
16693,Leonard,"want to come in, have a cup of tea?"
14062,Leonard,i thought we were going to play halo tonight.
12854,Leonard,go away.
21333,Leonard,do you know how much your car costs?
19232,Leonard,had will have placed?
13614,Leonard,oo-oo-oh!
19871,Leonard,"yeah. i worked hard on that speech, too."
19967,Leonard,"well, like i said, we’re about to get married, and i, i want a clean slate. no secrets."
13603,Leonard,he just won’t listen to me.
16443,Leonard,congratulations!
17029,Leonard,what are you doing here?
19918,Leonard,i don’t really feel i deserve it.
21699,Leonard,i hope it kills us both.
21438,Leonard,"well, to be truthful…"
14683,Leonard,"please, i’m asking you as a friend."
14909,Leonard,how come you didn’t tell me that you and father were getting a divorce? how come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? how come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
14695,Leonard,go! go! go! go-go-go-go! yes! are you people watching this? is this amazing or what?
20282,Leonard,my birthday.
17366,Leonard,really? i don’t even notice any more.
13035,Leonard,"hee-hee, just classic. "
12284,Leonard,i don’t know. tell her i’m sick.
19979,Leonard,"if you’re not into this, we can do it another time."
20977,Leonard,"you’ll have nerds fawning all over you. if you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble."
18557,Leonard,"the, the element never existed. i didn’t take it away, science took it away. be mad at science."
16267,Leonard,he kind of does.
16653,Leonard,"yeah. sure, sure."
14509,Leonard,"nothing bad, just that last night was fine."
15320,Leonard,fine. i’ll take him for shoes next saturday.
17659,Leonard,no.
19731,Leonard,"i don’t know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?"
17377,Leonard,you’re kidding.
21293,Leonard,okay. where were we?
17116,Leonard,why? what are you afraid of?
21534,Leonard,"third floor, wrong apartment."
12291,Leonard,we both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud. 
21188,Leonard,please tell me you didn’t use amy’s magic juice.
14411,Leonard,"sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. what’s up?"
19819,Leonard,"oh. when i encountered alien life, i discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot."
18785,Leonard,moo-stache.
13903,Leonard,where are you going?
19527,Leonard,sure.
20872,Leonard,i’d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.
19095,Leonard,i’d love to. i’m just about to do yoga with penny.
20740,Leonard,"i don’t think you have anything to worry about. raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault."
14209,Leonard,golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
17612,Leonard,"hey, what are you doing here?"
19709,Leonard,no.
20224,Leonard,is ernest goes to jail the only prison movie you’ve seen?
13261,Leonard,"yeah, i can see how that would… a bunch of people?"
18431,Leonard,"stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. all right. you seem pretty confident."
18568,Leonard,thanks.
17962,Leonard,that a problem?
13252,Leonard,"well, there’s joyce kim, but she defected back to north korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable."
21400,Leonard,"look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that penny and i are afraid to be alone."
13502,Leonard,no.
17300,Leonard,"sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut."
18532,Leonard,"wuh, penny."
17940,Leonard,"i know you’re joking, but i’d be okay with that."
21245,Leonard,"careful, i saw this on star trek. smoke’s gonna come out of his ears soon. hey."
14472,Leonard,really?
18920,Leonard,okay.
18430,Leonard,"i have to say, this is the best top ramen you’ve ever made."
15556,Leonard,sure.
21634,Leonard,what the…?
13334,Leonard,they never do.
17531,Leonard,"okay, i think i understand."
18560,Leonard,"fine, i’ll publish."
12855,Leonard,"if he were, i wouldn’t be. "
15626,Leonard,turned to boom-boom.
17133,Leonard,what?
13498,Leonard,yes.
13942,Leonard,"okay, how about this? i’ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable."
17972,Leonard,what do you want?
19012,Leonard,"why? because i’m a, a smart decision?"
16770,Leonard,"it’s kind of like the loch ness monster. maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. we’ll probably never know. but sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it."
15942,Leonard,"uh, i do, i have to work. but i’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend i am."
15566,Leonard,at the hands of your roommate?
19507,Leonard,buddy.
13084,Leonard,hey. 
15719,Leonard,"me? well, how am i supposed to fix it?"
20265,Leonard,not really.
18121,Leonard,call someone.
15270,Leonard,"okay, i’m sorry. i’ll shut up."
18216,Leonard,"he knows, wow."
17270,Leonard,yeah.
18511,Leonard,what?
21398,Leonard,"i don’t know who you talked to, but that wasn’t my mother."
17449,Leonard,we got you that book last year. wasn’t everything in there?
16799,Leonard,"oh, right, your name. that makes more sense than penis."
16643,Leonard,"yeah, yeah. uh, okay. you’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. ugh!"
17627,Leonard,you should visit more often. what are you doing?
21189,Leonard,see you guys at work.
14086,Leonard,"it’s just for my notebooks. thanks, penny."
16405,Leonard,it’s okay. you didn’t know. i’ll take care of it.
12295,Leonard,"good. good. and what about your, uh, hallway friend."
13585,Leonard,"yeah, a couple."
19259,Leonard,"well, i was just saying that there was this video game…"
14148,Leonard,where?
21066,Leonard,right. be polite.
21568,Leonard,"uh, so, ramona, tell us about yourself. do you, do you have a boyfriend?"
21121,Leonard,"all right, i tried."
18912,Leonard,what about loop quantum gravity?
18782,Leonard,"well, give it a go."
16054,Leonard,thank you. i thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
16168,Leonard,"yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?"
12350,Leonard,"that is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about sheldon?"
18108,Leonard,hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. mrs. davis.
21462,Leonard,that’s just great.
16209,Leonard,still arguing over which csi is the best?
17123,Leonard,"yeah, hi, hi. how’s it going?"
18225,Leonard,"well, it is. just, you know, i’d be gone for a while."
14016,Leonard,"ummm, i’m gonna go with “no.”"
16299,Leonard,"yeah, me, too."
17336,Leonard,"hey, listen, i kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then i wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if i should have asked you first. then i thought if i did check with you first, you’d think that i was taking things to seriously. and then, then i got a nosebleed."
13115,Leonard,"look, i understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful…."
14650,Leonard,"yeah, great."
15168,Leonard,"yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. hey, how about this? until we figure out what to do with the ring, penny holds on to it."
21768,Leonard,there you go– three against one.
18283,Leonard,"hey, i said i was sorry. what else do you want from me?"
15773,Leonard,drop axe.
14731,Leonard,"an old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. that’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely."
21480,Leonard,is that bert?
21266,Leonard,"i’m not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay."
14012,Leonard,"right. ah! where’s the lime?  oh, okay, we’re sharing."
12055,Leonard,well this is nice. we don’t have a lot of company over.
20449,Leonard,"thanks, sorry to bother you. but i said it like a badass."
21425,Leonard,"i mean, they didn’t say anything, but i just kind of felt like i was being a weird third wheel."
13591,Leonard,"doctor doctor. surgical resident. smart, pretty. let me ask you something. if your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?"
19385,Leonard,great timing. my check sphincter light just went on.
13137,Leonard,"yes, you should, go ahead, say it. "
19238,Leonard,all right.
16657,Leonard,"oh, hey, babe, i think i figured this thing out."
19053,Leonard,no.
12751,Leonard,there were only two people there?
17076,Leonard,"excuse me, amy. penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?"
16614,Leonard,"fine, whatever. priya will be having breakfast."
20385,Leonard,"well, what are you thinking of naming it?"
14225,Leonard,"oh, hey, stuart. this is penny. she’s looking for some comic books."
20128,Leonard,i did like that he had the weather on it.
20419,Leonard,"mm-hmm. well, i would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…"
13306,Leonard,"uh-huh. seriously, six months?"
16382,Leonard,come on.
21145,Leonard,"i found it, but it’s empty."
19250,Leonard,"look. we keep procrastinating. we saw back to the future ii, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like denmark."
14675,Leonard,huh… scrimmage…
14639,Leonard,i had to ask. you didn’t have to say yes.
17304,Leonard,"you know, i think this is a good stopping point. uh, it’s your first real game. i threw a lot of information at you."
21477,Leonard,that’s actually funny.
12395,Leonard,"oh, hi."
18671,Leonard,that’s a good question.
17295,Leonard,there’s no such thing as haircut records.
20822,Leonard,i’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
13166,Leonard,"sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with penny, what happens if i blow it. "
14707,Leonard,this is just half? we’ve been here for hours.
19214,Leonard,i think someone owes me an apology.
15294,Leonard,"i’m pretty sure martha stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat japanese guys."
16204,Leonard,"no, i mean, i, i, i got the money first."
20949,Leonard,"when you live with someone, there’s gonna be conflict. you just have to keep communicating."
12837,Leonard,"come on, dennis, i’ll show you the rec centre, they’ve got nautilus equipment."
20146,Leonard,i always wanted to be a swashbuckler when i was a kid.
16817,Leonard,no. sulfites. migraines.
13639,Leonard,i can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.
18429,Leonard,"oh, no."
16014,Leonard,you can’t replace me with zack.
17312,Leonard,great. what are you going to do first?
15494,Leonard,she’s not coming back.
18227,Leonard,couple of weeks.
20636,Leonard,is it a secret bank account? because that would be awesome.
15125,Leonard,"no, no, stan lee."
15161,Leonard,"no, it is not yours. we all went in on the box together."
19192,Leonard,"hey, here’s a thought. why don’t we put up the rest of the money that stuart needs?"
19628,Leonard,buddy.
16312,Leonard,"is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature’s way?"
19492,Leonard,"look at you, being all mature."
19230,Leonard,"well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions."
18724,Leonard,…thousand two hundred and eleven.
20963,Leonard,and who got him to try a turkey dog?
15351,Leonard,"well, who wants to stay in a hotel? with windows that don’t open, those crazy card-shaped keys."
13652,Leonard,don’t even! i don’t want to hear another word out of you.
17741,Leonard,"yeah, you all do. anyway, i feel like he’s hitting on her. she says he’s just being nice and that i should trust her."
18686,Leonard,"oh. oh, okay. good, good. so, it’s cool if i cry a little?"
16160,Leonard,"hello, mrs. latham. yes, i live with him. i don’t, i, i really don’t know why. tonight? sure, that’d be great. okay, i’ll, i’ll see you then. bye. she wants to have dinner and talk about my research."
14809,Leonard,"okay, so kripke played a joke on you."
16074,Leonard,what the hell are bus pants?
14153,Leonard,"okay, what’s wrong with it?"
14647,Leonard,you want to come watch?
14694,Leonard,"yeah, no, i’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at."
17453,Leonard,shame on her.
12804,Leonard,"okay, he must be in his bedroom. my spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my bat-signal. "
13280,Leonard,"okay, now my uncles are bald, but my aunt edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. so… sweet lady. it always tickles when she hugs me.  what now?"
18756,Leonard,"thank you. seriously, please don’t make me go."
12651,Leonard,sheldon i didn’t mean it like that.
14914,Leonard,"mother, remember when i was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?"
15589,Leonard,what the hell are you guys playing?
19992,Leonard,they’re running a little behind. should be pretty soon.
16810,Leonard,you’re kidding. you have your own book?
17649,Leonard,sorry. whatever. it’s all good.
14837,Leonard,"yeah, no, i got it."
13076,Leonard,"oh, i don’t think so."
14219,Leonard,or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
18365,Leonard,no. not everything is about my mom. 
19899,Leonard,east texas.
13404,Leonard,how did you get here in the first place?
13053,Leonard,"that’s great, but i…."
12616,Leonard,it’s from the institute for experimental physics. they want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on bowes-einstein condensates. 
15430,Leonard,hey.
14323,Leonard,about stuart? love to.
17276,Leonard,balls in the basket. 
12280,Leonard,okay.
13049,Leonard,thank you. 
21463,Leonard,i honestly don’t remember.
18916,Leonard,are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
16740,Leonard,"i’d like to propose a toast. the dream to go up into space is one we all share, and howard’s making that a reality. we’re all very proud of you."
18195,Leonard,yeah?
17013,Leonard,"jimmy, i’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me."
12687,Leonard,"believe it or not, personal growth. what happened?"
20205,Leonard,"okay, but now there’s this swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. we really need this helium."
13915,Leonard,"actually, it kind of… let’s keep looking. whoa, what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the los angeles county superior court?"
19375,Leonard,thank you.
13729,Leonard,"no! no, no! i wasn’t going to say any of that. i was just going to say, i really like you."
12115,Leonard,oh. we’re scientists.
12152,Leonard,"almost there, almost there, almost there. "
15471,Leonard,how many times have i asked you not to do that?
15015,Leonard,"don’t bark at me. i fell, too."
20287,Leonard,may what?
16579,Leonard,priya’s going back to india.
16751,Leonard,"hey, sheldon?"
13420,Leonard,how did you manage to get on the second floor of the glendale galleria?
17592,Leonard,"a solar system. uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? i don’t…"
14769,Leonard,"uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower."
21166,Leonard,who knows what he has down there.
12930,Leonard,the eta meson.
17882,Leonard,that was san diego comic-con. this is bakersfield comic-con.
19761,Leonard,thank you so much. see? maybe honesty is the best… what are you doing?
12570,Leonard,problem?
12638,Leonard,"no, i’m not shy."
16303,Leonard,no.
15214,Leonard,why don’t we just talk?
14235,Leonard,no.
17768,Leonard,i don’t have any.
15699,Leonard,"what about you, stuart? you have a girlfriend yet?"
15597,Leonard,did you guys see the paper in the american physics journal on supersolids? it’s pretty interesting. this guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
15117,Leonard,"yeah, i forgot about all this."
12846,Leonard,great.
20216,Leonard,let’s not jump to conclusions. a lot of things start with u.
18515,Leonard,i think you’re the one who fell over.
20036,Leonard,what are we gonna do?
18363,Leonard,"well, you’re, you’re right. let’s just go."
16993,Leonard,"no, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister."
20022,Leonard,"well, no, not socially. but, you know, just at work."
12925,Leonard,"oh, yeah. you know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing. "
16061,Leonard,no.
18888,Leonard,"two women at the same time? nice job, playa."
18469,Leonard,"no, i have to go pick him up. bill nye ditched him at the smoothie place."
13212,Leonard,no.
13416,Leonard,"okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic."
21012,Leonard,"buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago."
14067,Leonard,"really? great. sheldon, look. good as new."
18422,Leonard,we’ll be there.
19279,Leonard,"yeah, of course you do, i’m not just a genius in bed. you sure are, baby."
19063,Leonard,"well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. i’m sure he’s fine. he probably just needs a little alone time to decompress."
12787,Leonard,"yes, they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, i have to go. "
18058,Leonard,i wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run.
16561,Leonard,"if you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline."
12752,Leonard,"as you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let’s give them some privacy."
21423,Leonard,that would be great. thank you.
13002,Leonard,because i don’t want it any more. 
17785,Leonard,"you know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip."
20612,Leonard,so nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
19156,Leonard,so do we. and i’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.
14456,Leonard,"well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his darth vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the force, so i’d say, a little better."
17150,Leonard,what? yeah.
16776,Leonard,"we don’t say that, either. i’ll make you a list."
18255,Leonard,"okay, i’m hanging up now. you know there’s no such thing as a k… "
15588,Leonard,of course you must.
13702,Leonard,sheldon.  what’s going on?
15297,Leonard,how could you get lost? your phone has gps.
18579,Leonard,and i’m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.
15605,Leonard,got it.
21598,Leonard,"um, here’s something we didn’t anticipate. "
20528,Leonard,speech! speech!
13258,Leonard,like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. yep.
15535,Leonard,it came to $28.17. let’s say six bucks apiece.
19486,Leonard,this isn’t so bad.
17357,Leonard,interrupting physi…
16073,Leonard,i don’t want it better. i want it my way.
21641,Leonard,"it’s just two degrees, sheldon. i just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!"
19119,Leonard,exactly. right after they said yeah.
19711,Leonard,yeah. but now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.
18000,Leonard,"trying to have a magical night here, guys."
14511,Leonard,okay?
20788,Leonard,"oh, he’s like a different man. he stopped twitching, and i think he grew an inch and a half."
14092,Leonard,what are you doing?
17934,Leonard,128
19191,Leonard,"why? because they won’t get off your lawn? is stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?"
21131,Leonard,this is ridiculous.
15319,Leonard,i just took him for shoes.
14917,Leonard,"howard, artificial women are your department. you want to take this?"
14795,Leonard,"with penny and me, it took two years. now that i think about it, that was three dates."
13880,Leonard,i didn’t think he had it in him.
19096,Leonard,"oh, my god, are you okay?"
13434,Leonard,"well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until i’m finished with my experiment."
19949,Leonard,are you saying you want to get married?
13780,Leonard,"okay, i have just one question for you. while i am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because i was too smart for you! well, news flash, lady, david underhill is ten times smarter than me! you’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! next to him, i’m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! so, my question is, what’s up with that?"
12384,Leonard,"gee, uh…"
14475,Leonard,saloons?
20721,Leonard,"oh, so i shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?"
16400,Leonard,"fine, don’t tell me."
13551,Leonard,can we just forget i said defcon and go?
20957,Leonard,"look, even when penny and i started living together, there was a learning curve. but i promise you, it does get easier."
17621,Leonard,it’s actually pretty neat.
13123,Leonard,i said i’m her friend. not her gay friend. 
18646,Leonard,should’ve let sheldon come.
19713,Leonard,"i swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter."
18981,Leonard,i don’t know what you’re upset about. i’m the one who’s losing.
13920,Leonard,did he pay you back?
13988,Leonard,"you know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it."
14161,Leonard,"the fifth annual east rutherford, new jersey, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender alliance luau."
13457,Leonard,"hey, aren’t you having breakfast?"
19821,Leonard,are you kidding? yes. what did you have in mind?
13788,Leonard,"come on, it’s christmas, just give me this one."
13364,Leonard,you look very nice.
15684,Leonard,jealousy? what do i have to be jealous of?
18305,Leonard,couples sounds great. or we could mix things up. maybe pick names out of a hat. whatever.
15371,Leonard,"what, uh, you and me? yeah, we did. not too long ago. how are you doing with it?"
17765,Leonard,all that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
19557,Leonard,you do? you’re not messing with me?
14566,Leonard,"i’m not. and penny’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is."
14100,Leonard,is that who i think it is?
18847,Leonard,calling 911.
13868,Leonard,"don’t look up, there’s cameras."
15710,Leonard,that was two hours ago.
13467,Leonard,"okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is."
21607,Leonard,"sheldon, you want to catch me up again?"
20553,Leonard,"or, if we ended up making money from this, sheldon and i could split our shares with you."
20494,Leonard,how is that a new invention?
18626,Leonard,i bet that bit killed at the chuckle hut.
19618,Leonard,"that’s it, that’s the line."
20424,Leonard,that someone has a name.
14227,Leonard,you mean for someone who’s into comic books?
20117,Leonard,"come on, buddy."
21391,Leonard,and i think it’s nice that you’re taking whatever medication amy’s clearly giving you.
15440,Leonard,"sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks."
19969,Leonard,"see, now i’m confused. i mean, what, what am i supposed to do?"
17452,Leonard,"i’m sorry, that must be very difficult for you."
15649,Leonard,"no, no, no, i can do it."
19039,Leonard,"thanks, mom."
17722,Leonard,"it’s not a big deal. he’s just in her history class. they’re working on a project together. i don’t even know why i care. you know what, i don’t care."
12807,Leonard,fine.
16116,Leonard,"sure, no problem."
12383,Leonard,no kidding?
17174,Leonard,"look at that. some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard."
14571,Leonard,"really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late."
17471,Leonard,"come on, sheldon, it’ll be fun."
13006,Leonard,"no, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or darth vader voice changers, i’m getting rid of all of it. "
12668,Leonard,"really, so why did you come?"
17917,Leonard,you get that these are personalised action figures.
17563,Leonard,"wait, alex. do you want to join us?"
20944,Leonard,i’ll give you a hint. we’re watching daredevil.
12916,Leonard,"raj, we’re not getting tv’s blossom to join our physics bowl team. "
12945,Leonard,bring it on.
13731,Leonard,hey.
18871,Leonard,"forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?"
13979,Leonard,"all right. uh, what’s new with you?"
20217,Leonard,"listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules."
20019,Leonard,"no, she had dental insurance."
12623,Leonard,"excuse me, i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis. "
17533,Leonard,what?
16949,Leonard,"i know, i, i, i crossed a line. and i’m sorry. no, no, no, hang on. i really mean it. and it’s not like when we were going out, i’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. this is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table i’m sorry."
17707,Leonard,who you talking to?
13425,Leonard,what does that mean?
13505,Leonard,put it on the agenda.
16237,Leonard,"i don’t know what to tell you, sheldon. i’m going to see priya. everyone’s over there. you coming or not?"
19585,Leonard,"well, maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level."
16030,Leonard,green lantern.
19068,Leonard,"not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, i get worried."
13794,Leonard,"you know, ’cause you’re so into science."
16029,Leonard,not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on new year’s eve.
20511,Leonard,way to narrow it down to everything.
16562,Leonard,until you have kids.
18206,Leonard,yeah.
21103,Leonard,"oh, yeah. the mr. spock cuckoo clock."
19528,Leonard,cinnamon. give me another one.
19304,Leonard,"okay, um, look, i’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at you."
18566,Leonard,i can’t believe they kicked you out. 
13087,Leonard,oh. pass. 
20102,Leonard,and there’s your damsel.
15786,Leonard,"oh, right, sure. i wish you could stay in la a while longer."
17629,Leonard,"no, no. it’s kind of crazy. i’ve never fooled around in the lab before."
21028,Leonard,ghobe’ 
19400,Leonard,you were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. you love me.
20123,Leonard,"oh, thank god."
15283,Leonard,you know what? i’ll just spend the evening alone.
16913,Leonard,"no. you always picked, and it was always the same. an hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along."
17937,Leonard,"sheldon lee cooper, i do not have time for this nonsense. now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work."
19404,Leonard,"i know. you can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that’s left are some papers in a box."
18061,Leonard,and now you’re also an astronaut.
21580,Leonard,"hey, what’s the matter? "
16576,Leonard,uh. that is a beautiful tapestry.
17691,Leonard,and you?
12063,Leonard,"oh, okay. i love cheesecake."
20832,Leonard,"mary, i’m sorry you’re in the middle of this."
17891,Leonard,really?
17465,Leonard,i have a couple more quick questions. do you want to call me from the car?
19225,Leonard,"ah, here it is. whoa. i haven’t looked at these in years. robot girlfriend."
16258,Leonard,i am leaving.
16837,Leonard,"yeah, me, too. i can’t make up my mind."
14014,Leonard,"you shush, i’m happy, i want to talk about it. you know what my mother would say about this? she would say because you were not loved by your father and i was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children."
17598,Leonard,"yeah, that’s when it started."
16791,Leonard,that was pretty droll. with a hint of ammonia.
19037,Leonard,you know what? it’s probably fine.
12407,Leonard,brrrr. why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
14327,Leonard,he wants to talk about penny. i don’t want to talk about penny.
17704,Leonard,"right, the case of who murdered three saturday nights of my life?"
12617,Leonard,"okay… if i may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out."
21761,Leonard,they’re lawn chairs. and there was no place for company.
19258,Leonard,"so, one of my favourite video games of all time is called shadow of the colossus, and it was only for playstation 2, but then they came out with a new version for ps3 with better graphics. i finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. or something about yoga."
18882,Leonard,so it’s a family film.
12097,Leonard,"oh, i’ll probably say yes."
16232,Leonard,i’m having dinner with priya at raj’s. i think howard’s going to be there. you want to join us?
14823,Leonard,who is that with him?
15635,Leonard,"cats, sheldon. you’re clearly upset about amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats."
12732,Leonard,"howard, listen…"
16494,Leonard,wonder why she didn’t tell me.
21696,Leonard,"all right, pressure’s off"
18105,Leonard,"oh, very. assuming she takes my call."
17112,Leonard,"yeah, except for when i got the foot cramp."
16604,Leonard,"sorry, sheldon, it’s just not a good time for playing games."
16999,Leonard,i didn’t have clams.
18917,Leonard,i don’t know. i heard you reading pretty loud last night.
17618,Leonard,sign right there.
18843,Leonard,"i mean, you could say thank you. i did just buy you a car."
12602,Leonard,you left with his date. friends don’t do that to each other. 
13368,Leonard,anythingforagreencard.com?
12676,Leonard,you’re lucky i didn’t run you over. 
14032,Leonard,"what about it, howard?"
20349,Leonard,"yeah, the wait is finally over."
15952,Leonard,"mm, dreamily doodling mrs. leonard hofstadter in a notebook?"
13601,Leonard,"howard, come on, i didn’t plan on this. these things just happen. usually not to me, but they do happen."
15593,Leonard,what?
20790,Leonard,"i know, and there’s no excuse for that."
17672,Leonard,"good morning, sunshine."
12070,Leonard,"no, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. and paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. now if you look at huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes albert einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. well, i didn’t make it worse."
14579,Leonard,"what do you mean, he’s getting deported?"
12507,Leonard,"okay, fine, we’ll just play one on one until he gets back. "
17963,Leonard,he’s got amy now.
12370,Leonard,"yeah, my parents felt that naming me leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough. "
16226,Leonard,my sister’s 38 and married.
13933,Leonard,"you guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out."
20183,Leonard,he’s got what we need and can meet us tonight.
12140,Leonard,"um, if you don’t have any other plans, do you want to join us for thai food and a superman movie marathon?"
17404,Leonard,are you drinking whisky?
19177,Leonard,i killed his chewbacca slippers.
15388,Leonard,"boy, i’m kind of tuckered out. how are you feeling, elizabeth?"
16514,Leonard,what’s going on?
12625,Leonard,"alright, i don’t care what you say, i’m going to the conference and i’m presenting our findings. "
15031,Leonard,because we didn’t want to be disturbed.
19350,Leonard,was that a flask?
20196,Leonard,"uh, i’m leonard. this is my friend…"
12110,Leonard,"excuse me, if i were to give up at the first little hitch i never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang."
20160,Leonard,"i’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, sheldon."
12366,Leonard,lesley and i do research together at the university. 
15425,Leonard,"well, it turns out i had a little rocket fuel in the apartment."
16849,Leonard,"wait, i don’t, which part?"
20067,Leonard,"uh, okay, well, um, i got married recently."
13704,Leonard,"listen, we need to talk."
13754,Leonard,ow! ow!
15330,Leonard,we’re not fighting.
14133,Leonard,"hey, how’d it go?"
13201,Leonard,"great. so you just let me know when you know. so…  oh god, i am the bad fish! what did i do wrong?"
13649,Leonard,"it’s not bold, it’s a mistake. i didn’t change my status."
19549,Leonard,"exactly, except you don’t have a lunatic running around, yelling, i fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?"
21377,Leonard,now you can come with us.
19708,Leonard,"if you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working."
15701,Leonard,why don’t you just break up with her?
13842,Leonard,"alright, please don’t cheer me up anymore."
14957,Leonard,you know what? let’s just get a pizza.
18275,Leonard,"i don’t. i really don’t. just try it on. oh, yeah."
12554,Leonard,"well, with wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend christie, "
14377,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s two o’clock in the morning."
19121,Leonard,and you thought they all had a silver lining.
15428,Leonard,"not only did sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. or the police. or homeland security."
19463,Leonard,"no, we’re both to blame. you know, let me take the heat on this one."
18524,Leonard,i can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.
16024,Leonard,it’s leonard.
20408,Leonard,"oh, great. do that."
20522,Leonard,don’t say that to anyone.
17303,Leonard,hmm.
17983,Leonard,you’re kidding. did you heimlich him?
18653,Leonard,"look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. luke skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the death star. he had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of the force, he… wow, i can feel you hating me right now."
21212,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, let’s talk about it. i’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. please tell me what more i could do?"
13126,Leonard,of course not.
18439,Leonard,i can’t believe you saved all this stuff.
18007,Leonard,yeah.
14420,Leonard,"terrific, it’s just that i don’t think penny wants me to go."
14961,Leonard,we like games.
12599,Leonard,beats the hell out of me. 
18842,Leonard,don’t say anything.
12369,Leonard,why at my place?
15767,Leonard,"it’s getting pretty late, how come you’re still up?"
13885,Leonard,"sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc slurpie-icee equivalency?"
20369,Leonard,"uh, she’s my mother. you know her?"
19760,Leonard,"i’m sorry, don’t listen to him. we’re actually physicists. we’re giving a lecture at berkeley later today. we just, we had some time to kill."
19193,Leonard,it’s kind of a dream come true.
19391,Leonard,"well, i do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike."
19289,Leonard,she made him a chore chart.
15746,Leonard,wow. wouldn’t think there’d be that many.
16358,Leonard,"well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun."
20816,Leonard,my father’s not texting me back.
21052,Leonard,really? the last green thing i saw you eat was a skittle.
18740,Leonard,maybe this isn’t a good idea.
17813,Leonard,"okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen."
13295,Leonard,"sorry leslie, i guess i prefer my space stringy not loopy."
15886,Leonard,would someone please turn off the sheldon commentary track?
13224,Leonard,"not that secret, the other secret."
13760,Leonard,"yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg."
18715,Leonard,"listen, i could never do what you’re doing, okay? i would be terrified."
16535,Leonard,you really are a mean little man.
18973,Leonard,"mm, you know, that i didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language."
20327,Leonard,"hey, can we please get back to work?"
15968,Leonard,"gee, i don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir."
18835,Leonard,you sure you want to do this?
18504,Leonard,"no, it’s, it’s almost done. i just, i have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the dvd and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so i can get a skin graft."
12010,Leonard,"what, are you kidding? you’re a semi-pro. "
15090,Leonard,seriously?
16370,Leonard,"fine. you walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. what if he says no?"
13184,Leonard,"yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. solve for r."
12816,Leonard,i know. 
21594,Leonard,"a bad feeling i have about this, mmm-hmmm. "
18941,Leonard,yeah. we should do it more often.
16575,Leonard,so. hot in india?
19397,Leonard,"okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, i didn’t even want you there."
14253,Leonard,what else you got?
20003,Leonard,i love you.
12953,Leonard,"it was a spur of the moment thing, i figured it would go for thousands and i just wanted to be a part of it. "
16077,Leonard,hold on. that’s it!
12561,Leonard,who are you calling?
16148,Leonard,oh. we should get going.
15379,Leonard,"yeah, i guess i did."
13226,Leonard,i promise. 
14089,Leonard,"yeah, i wish."
16827,Leonard,"well, i was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth."
16811,Leonard,"cool. oh, look. that’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a chewbacca costume. comic con?"
16909,Leonard,you’re right. i’m fine. i’m wearing this.
20171,Leonard,what are we going to do?
20267,Leonard,by stalking them?
21173,Leonard,"well, we had started binge-watching luke cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then i find out that she watched two episodes without me. "
19298,Leonard,yes.
17292,Leonard,i’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. i’ll pick you up when you’re done.
16792,Leonard,"uh, yeah. it’s issue number 21. first appearance of hellboy."
18423,Leonard,i will not.
16450,Leonard,you might not want to do that.
20654,Leonard,"oh, sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months."
12424,Leonard,are you even listening to me?
19078,Leonard,"come on, come home with us and tomorrow i’ll, i’ll take you to legoland."
17414,Leonard,right. to howard.
21179,Leonard,"look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening."
12465,Leonard,oh no.
15878,Leonard,because you feel guilty?
19699,Leonard,what are we doing?
18166,Leonard,it was pretty cool.
16091,Leonard,"thank you. so as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on facebook right from the app."
17991,Leonard,you can’t find a card that says that?
17655,Leonard,"really? ‘cause i went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once."
13078,Leonard,"no, it’s no big deal, it’s just the way i was raised. my parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them."
15742,Leonard,"thanks again for doing this, bernadette."
18622,Leonard,is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?
16971,Leonard,a tribe of abra-comanches.
13149,Leonard,"oh, penny, i am so sorry."
17071,Leonard,it’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book.
20455,Leonard,what are you gonna say?
15391,Leonard,"hey, who’s ready for halo?"
20545,Leonard,"yeah, we did our own search."
16569,Leonard,when is the time?
20606,Leonard,i bought a baseball cap.
15422,Leonard,"it was, but one night, sheldon came home from work… "
16239,Leonard,come with me to raj’s and eat there.
13088,Leonard,"look, i am in the halo battle of my life here, there’s this kid in copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play halo 24/7."
12087,Leonard,it’s just not a good time.
12458,Leonard,"this is ridiculous, i’m jumping in."
18327,Leonard,"yeah, penny might be onto something."
16017,Leonard,what are you doing?
18009,Leonard,all right.
18700,Leonard,"i don’t know. she already thinks i don’t support this, so if i call, it might look like i’m checking up on her."
12931,Leonard,prevost’s theory of exchanges. 
18104,Leonard,i just keep thinking about how cool it would be if i called my mom and told her that i got tenure at caltech.
15266,Leonard,"penny, you’re up."
17706,Leonard,"yeah, it was."
19004,Leonard,"yeah, but there was ample parking."
16228,Leonard,"oh, wow. i love taming of the shrew. i did a paper on it in high school. who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? in his tail."
12613,Leonard,"wireless webcams, wave hello. "
20377,Leonard,"oh, great. dr. gallo is terrific. you know, i, i’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what i have to say, but she made me see…"
13590,Leonard,"oh, she’s a doctor."
20294,Leonard,"face it, you can’t stump me. i am the king of husbands. i know that you don’t like the lingerie that i got you on valentine’s day. i know you hate the word moist. i know…"
16878,Leonard,"oh, he was up late last night, so i gave him an early dinner and put him to bed."
12493,Leonard,"nothing, you’re perfect."
13474,Leonard,i know. when is she going home?
17129,Leonard,yes.
21572,Leonard,i don’t know.
17397,Leonard,"yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. nothing to worry about."
17609,Leonard,"yeah, maybe. open it first."
14789,Leonard,will you shut up? we’re all hungry.
19166,Leonard,what?
13898,Leonard,don’t worry about it. it’s my treat.
17519,Leonard,go ahead.
18581,Leonard,i love it.
16265,Leonard,"hear, hear."
17012,Leonard,"oh, i can’t take all the credit. you helped a lot."
14995,Leonard,"any place specific or just the bozeman, montana loony bin?"
17298,Leonard,"when you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky."
18514,Leonard,were you drunk?
15727,Leonard,"yeah. turns out, they guard the ipods, but they don’t guard the shirts."
20390,Leonard,good for you.
14361,Leonard,wine? i didn’t say to give her wine.
18475,Leonard,"uh, if i still have them, they’re probably in the junk box."
19936,Leonard,"you still want to get married, right?"
14862,Leonard,we didn’t have a tree when i was growing up.
14517,Leonard,what are we drinking now?
19283,Leonard,maybe.
17880,Leonard,"oh, thanks, i thought i had more."
13341,Leonard,"well, we’re going to go apologise to raj and invite him out to dinner."
19172,Leonard,what are you worried about?
19356,Leonard,"wow, you look amazing."
18680,Leonard,it doesn’t.
16003,Leonard,what would i even say?
12054,Leonard,"sheldon, sit!"
16213,Leonard,priya’s in town?
19204,Leonard,why are you even part of this conversation? you don’t know anything about women.
15211,Leonard,"i’m sorry, i’ll start again."
17889,Leonard,what did you do?
16123,Leonard,i’d like to kick your little brown ass.
15871,Leonard,i feel awful.
14176,Leonard,"so they steamed your dumplings, get over it. new topic, please."
21465,Leonard,hey. want to join us?
16394,Leonard,shooting at a target?
14729,Leonard,i don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
18447,Leonard,"dr. jeffries, hello again. leonard hofstadter."
15448,Leonard,"okay, well, yeah, come on up. so, how’d you two guys meet?"
14152,Leonard,"i’m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the web site. so, what do you guys think?"
12274,Leonard,"you’re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well."
15089,Leonard,"yeah. he thinks i betrayed him. i mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?"
19082,Leonard,you know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.
13849,Leonard,i assumed he was joking. you’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
15137,Leonard,for what?
20247,Leonard,"hey, buddy. how you doing?"
20471,Leonard,"no, i don’t need any fish nibbling my business."
18693,Leonard,do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
13422,Leonard,"aw, the pet store?"
16588,Leonard,what the hell is wrong with you?
14586,Leonard,hey.
19363,Leonard,"no, you wouldn’t have."
20479,Leonard,ready to play when you are.
18243,Leonard,yep. i’m really gonna miss you.
17676,Leonard,don’t ask me. a little elf did it.
18759,Leonard,to the bedroom.
19621,Leonard,"wait, sheldon gave me a banana in a box. he was testing me, too."
20115,Leonard,i still don’t understand why you bought that pill caddie. you’re a young man.
19506,Leonard,i’m not leaving your world. i’m just talking about living across the hall.
21561,Leonard,if i take a lactaid a half-hour before and some pepto right after.
16088,Leonard,we’re not playing. this is real work.
21372,Leonard,why would i be upset?
19596,Leonard,you really didn’t like our paper?
21351,Leonard,"okay, so this is the main comic-con floor. it’s where all the vendors and exhibits are."
21128,Leonard,"sheldon, what do you think you’re doing? "
13394,Leonard,no.
20492,Leonard,that’s just research. we’re never gonna make any money from it.
14387,Leonard,"well, then don’t go."
19339,Leonard,"i know you-you don’t want to hear it, but she was there with stuart."
13446,Leonard,"uh-huh. the viewing area’s right over there. sheldon, your girl… date… person… ramona’s here."
20380,Leonard,so you’ll go to the doctor who convention with me next week?
20322,Leonard,how does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?
19362,Leonard,"oh, it’s all right. we ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…"
20338,Leonard,"i don’t know what to tell you, but they’re on sale."
21445,Leonard,we’ve had this planned for a week.
19755,Leonard,"we’re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue zelda."
17897,Leonard,"mine, too. anybody got any ideas?"
13803,Leonard,"i’m begging you, stop talking."
17864,Leonard,come here. tell you a secret?
20967,Leonard,what do you think?
15929,Leonard,penny kissing me is not insane. she used to kiss me all the time.
19183,Leonard,have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken dna to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?
16640,Leonard,"uh, you’re a naughty girl. and, and, uh, i, i want to punish you with my love?"
14136,Leonard,ready.
12670,Leonard,"i’ve had enough of your condescension. maybe i didn’t go to college when i was eleven like you, maybe i got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. no offense. and i am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation."
20829,Leonard,"hey, guys, come on in."
21676,Leonard,"yeah, i’m sweating my bald cap off."
20895,Leonard,thank you.
15794,Leonard,air freshener.
21279,Leonard,that’s because we are.
15659,Leonard,"all right, fine. so you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did."
12336,Leonard,so… fish. 
13486,Leonard,really? define it.
21032,Leonard,you really didn’t think i’d notice my stuff was missing?
18822,Leonard,"but penny, this was your idea. you said that i should stand up to him."
18103,Leonard,"mm, not really."
20640,Leonard,"if that’s what you want to do, yes."
15955,Leonard,what do you want me to do? you started this. do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
13584,Leonard,hey.
15768,Leonard,that’s pretty cool.
16198,Leonard,do you mean?
14281,Leonard,"that’s not an email, that’s leslie’s facebook page."
15042,Leonard,no cilantro?
19162,Leonard,how ridiculous is he?
12714,Leonard,"oh, i’m getting a bad feeling. "
13357,Leonard,not yet.
17411,Leonard,"wow, that’s very nice."
17307,Leonard,hey.
17272,Leonard,what’s he doing here?
14983,Leonard,he just gave it to you?
16448,Leonard,"i can’t hear you, i’m in the shower."
17398,Leonard,"well, i don’t know. it’s a bachelor party. there could be strippers. wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?"
21168,Leonard,absolutely not.
15487,Leonard,"uh, i know! it’s been a while!"
20052,Leonard,"what, you actually want to meet her?"
15531,Leonard,tough break. you want eggs?
19832,Leonard,"well, aliens could only play the golden record if they figured out how to build a record player."
20578,Leonard,we had a full spool yesterday.
12908,Leonard,because you’re taking all the fun out of it.
14799,Leonard,are you really going to be on npr?
15296,Leonard,for an hour and a half?
17440,Leonard,"i don’t know, it just came out. people say weird things during sex all the time."
18257,Leonard,best time of my life. 
14174,Leonard,"sorry. my apologies to the gay community of east rutherford, new jersey."
21094,Leonard,"oh, i don’t mind. if you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like i’m walking with my grandma."
13621,Leonard,"what, sheldon? what, sheldon? what, sheldon?"
16377,Leonard,i can’t believe we’re going all the way to san diego to confront this guy.
16602,Leonard,"hang on, sheldon. how could you not tell me your sister was moving back to india?"
17237,Leonard,can i control the thermostat?
20319,Leonard,"which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service."
17160,Leonard,"how about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?"
17165,Leonard,"night. attaboy, hofstadter. nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. hey, i’m back."
14018,Leonard,she said shush. i should have shushed. 
21458,Leonard,"but, boy, it is funny to think about."
21630,Leonard,"fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la."
20723,Leonard,just a whole lot of afrin.
14838,Leonard,"ah, terrific. we’re getting the electron accelerator set up. we should be ready to go day after tomorrow."
16389,Leonard,"uh, i kind of told her i was working."
18998,Leonard,"whoa, whoa, hang on. there’s no need to insult her."
19057,Leonard,it’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
14334,Leonard,"well, what are you gonna do?"
13766,Leonard,"yeah, if you like that type."
14763,Leonard,"it’s a little hard to explain. he does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us."
15800,Leonard,fine. with.
16422,Leonard,i didn’t say raj. who said raj?
19532,Leonard,so you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?
14953,Leonard,"i know, and pyramid power and healing crystals."
19257,Leonard,"yeah, it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost."
19946,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not a whiner."
15353,Leonard,"oh, . i think any university would want you. except, of course, any university that had already had you. because they would’ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you."
13952,Leonard,i don’t need backup. i have right on my side. and i’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
14954,Leonard,"really, that’s the line? psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?"
12592,Leonard,it’s amazing.
16463,Leonard,why would i want to do that?
15437,Leonard,what for? it’s not going to rain.
20221,Leonard,thank you.
13411,Leonard,booting.
20271,Leonard,"okay, we saw them. can we go catch the movie?"
18224,Leonard,"anyway, stephen hawking’s team is looking into that, and i’ve been invited to join them."
17278,Leonard,i get it.
13300,Leonard,oh yeah.
18551,Leonard,yes. do you know what that means? that means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
20417,Leonard,they’re not going on the trip.
17675,Leonard,"no, no. listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. and when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. open it."
13463,Leonard,"hey, penny."
18214,Leonard,i have a job.
15035,Leonard,keep going.
15591,Leonard,"uh, a blt where the b stands for beaver? i don’t know."
15423,Leonard,i’m getting to it. 
15483,Leonard,"great. maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?"
14156,Leonard,you want to fire me?
19112,Leonard,hang on. you travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?
13595,Leonard,does that change things?
15563,Leonard,"sheldon, this is ridiculous."
12637,Leonard,here?
20478,Leonard,hey.
16098,Leonard,i can vouch for that.
21034,Leonard,and?
12441,Leonard,you went with thor?
18585,Leonard, what do you think?
17410,Leonard,oh.
18244,Leonard,"anyway, we can e-mail, and i think the phone connections are pretty good."
21536,Leonard,"you won’t believe it, the military confiscated our project."
19876,Leonard,a cap and gown? why do i need a cap and gown?
13133,Leonard,doesn’t that violate the health code?
18467,Leonard,"you know what, sheldon is the smartest person i have ever met. and he’s a little broken and he needs me. i guess i need him, too."
20305,Leonard,why would i lie?
18770,Leonard,"oh, no, come on. it was a while. it was a while."
19376,Leonard,i think you could give a better clue.
20135,Leonard,fine.
15787,Leonard,"you know, i was thinking, there are some great research facilities in india."
19394,Leonard,the doctor said i should be out of surgery by ten.
21342,Leonard,what is pink cheeks?
12700,Leonard,i highly doubt that. go away. . are you still out there? 
16906,Leonard,i’m going to the movies with penny. i don’t want her to think that i think it’s a date.
21680,Leonard,that is my girlfriend. i swear to god.
17572,Leonard,"not yet, but i can remove unwanted hair from two miles away."
14058,Leonard,wackadoodle.
19342,Leonard,"hey, where’s bernadette?"
17159,Leonard,"oh, i can take it slow. did i ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, karen berberick? to this day she doesn’t know we were going out. made it easier on her when i broke things off."
20875,Leonard,"oh, my turn, my turn."
15288,Leonard,and you think my presence will help with that?
12604,Leonard,hold on. what happened with you and lalita?
19320,Leonard,"oh, he was upset. so sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage."
21628,Leonard,do not make a sound.
16774,Leonard,your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on burbank.
13755,Leonard,"yeah, i guess."
19539,Leonard,you didn’t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.
14705,Leonard,"oh, look at that. the oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. i hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-outs."
15103,Leonard,i don’t need to see your presentation. this discussion is over!
20378,Leonard,"okay, now, what i’m hearing is that you feel that i sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish i’d be more succinct."
19500,Leonard,"yes, it’s true. the last time i brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away."
20258,Leonard,what brought this on?
16733,Leonard,thank you.
21508,Leonard,uh.
14828,Leonard,yeah. hey.
13074,Leonard,"oh, it’s called trestling."
13190,Leonard,i’m not the fish. 
16119,Leonard,"no. no, i understand. i got too intense, you had to back off."
20726,Leonard,but we won’t bore you with the details.
18210,Leonard,"hey, you guys have been in there for a while. you doing okay?"
18708,Leonard,"oh, how many times do i have to say it? i support you."
14539,Leonard,perfectly formed miniature human being.
19702,Leonard,does it have a camera in it?
21202,Leonard,"so, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night."
20250,Leonard,no.
12303,Leonard,"actually, it’s centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. "
17830,Leonard,hey. just playing a little giant jenga here.
20184,Leonard,the man restocking the cereal shelves.
13907,Leonard,"yeah, they’re very considerate that way."
12192,Leonard,"sure, that’s another way to go."
15894,Leonard,"guys, that’s really starting to get old."
20866,Leonard,that’s a lot less big.
15921,Leonard,"oh, good. context."
14203,Leonard,"yeah, i’ll get to it, don’t nag me."
17184,Leonard,right. sorry.
14563,Leonard,no.
17104,Leonard,ah now th-th-there you go. always made it worse.
20105,Leonard,we’re gonna be here foreever.
14850,Leonard,and what would that be?
13250,Leonard,what happened to you?
21702,Leonard,"you got to stop beating yourself up over this. i mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake."
19354,Leonard,"you know, ’cause, ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night."
21500,Leonard,"ha, i knew you weren’t asleep."
19968,Leonard,would you rather i didn’t tell you?
21111,Leonard,i would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
20162,Leonard,maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?
12549,Leonard,"if we have extra, we’ll just take the leftovers home."
19609,Leonard,we’re not selling his tomatoes on ebay.
19498,Leonard,"because of you, i’m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. i’m not allowed to whistle. i don’t wear shoes that might squeak."
16414,Leonard,really? who?
15622,Leonard,"i’m sorry, i’m-i’m still trying to work on the defecating clark maxwell, so…"
15153,Leonard,"here’s spock’s head with no body. here’s mr. t’s body with no head. oh, yeah, here’s spock’s body with mr. t’s head. i pity the fool who’s illogical."
13670,Leonard,"thank you, sheldon."
18358,Leonard,"sorry, buddy."
19196,Leonard,"hold on. so, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?"
20850,Leonard,"you do that, too?"
21281,Leonard,"nicely done, howard."
17210,Leonard,"that’s not bad, howard “rocket man” wolowitz."
12716,Leonard,what’s important?
20496,Leonard,doesn’t matter. he’s headed for the kitchen anyway.
14617,Leonard,"because when i made that agreement, i didn’t think i’d ever have a hot girlfriend. and i was positive you never would."
21436,Leonard,"anyway, i know it’s silly, but since raj moved in, i’ve been feeling a little left out."
13019,Leonard,"it is a little big for the living room, isn’t it?"
16174,Leonard,then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
21322,Leonard,how ya doing?
16650,Leonard,"oh, damn it!"
12726,Leonard,"so she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in pasadena, when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in long beach? "
17959,Leonard,"i swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being i have ever met."
17139,Leonard,"yeah, it’s all good. we-we’ll always have feelings for each other."
12546,Leonard,"can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four."
20985,Leonard,"well, i brought my moneymaker. let me shake it. "
14913,Leonard,"what the hell, agreed."
18783,Leonard,additional data. you dog.
20168,Leonard,what’s going on?
15581,Leonard,i’m still going to go with you.
14603,Leonard,are you sure?
15748,Leonard,"should be, it’s thirty dollars a pound."
20212,Leonard,"the dealer doesn’t care, kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. help me hook this up."
12892,Leonard,yes.
17068,Leonard,"there you go, howard. sounds like raj’ll have your babies, problem solved."
19922,Leonard,"oh, my mother."
18079,Leonard,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. i meant, golly, sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time."
12145,Leonard,why not?
19606,Leonard,"mmm, when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation."
14656,Leonard,"oh, how kind of her."
20450,Leonard,really? i’ve never done that before. does it work?
12760,Leonard,"yeah, right here. how was nebraska?"
12319,Leonard,"yes, i was there."
13784,Leonard,"oh, yeah. i’m so… oh, that’s terrible."
15037,Leonard,sounds like a great plan.
12150,Leonard,men do things for women without expecting sex.
12262,Leonard,"they…. might all be there. or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example sheldon had quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn’t, it’s no fault of quizznos, they have a varied menu."
21259,Leonard,"yeah, sure. he really worked with the drug enforcement agency?"
20335,Leonard,aw. am i like the dryer sheets of your heart?
12514,Leonard,i guess for you that’s an option.
20032,Leonard,can’t believe i’m spending my wedding night with you.
14715,Leonard,who is this justin?
14117,Leonard,"only ten hours, 55 minutes to go."
16661,Leonard,aren’t you going with sheldon?
14121,Leonard,so?
18751,Leonard,"plus, i’m not sure it’s a great idea to take penny to where wine comes from. what? it’s a joke. oh, come on. we bust on each other. i wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs."
12672,Leonard,you cannot blow up my head with your mind. 
16485,Leonard,you okay?
18840,Leonard,i know. i thought we’d take yours.
19329,Leonard,what?
13723,Leonard,huh.
15325,Leonard,"yeah, don’t let goofy near him. he’ll have nightmares and i’ll have to deal with it."
21191,Leonard,"hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in santa barbara and you said that was you’d ever had?"
15157,Leonard,oh.
16882,Leonard,what’s going on?
16344,Leonard,what’s going on?
12926,Leonard,sheldon.
14721,Leonard,what was your first clue?
12240,Leonard,"i was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. but we don’t need to quibble over terminology. "
12796,Leonard,i’m… uh… in a… i’m in a radiation suit. what’s up?
16304,Leonard,"all right, well, anyway, darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else."
13637,Leonard,stitches? with a needle?
20718,Leonard,"okay, have fun."
16597,Leonard,that’s so nice.
19971,Leonard,yeah?
14389,Leonard,"sheldon, what are the words i can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?"
12640,Leonard,putting them on.
12661,Leonard,"it’s a classic, right? "
19587,Leonard,and you don’t think that’s too rough?
21157,Leonard,"sorry, stuart."
13963,Leonard,"no, i didn’t realize it had been so long. sure, i guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it."
20864,Leonard,where did you go to school?
15220,Leonard,for what?
13496,Leonard,yes.
18819,Leonard,so why are you trying to ruin it?
14259,Leonard,"actually, you can. there’s a whole sport built around it. falconry."
12960,Leonard,snipe!
13382,Leonard,he’s not going to have intercourse with penny.
12658,Leonard,"all? in particle physics, twenty five is woodstock. "
21447,Leonard,when does that start?
16700,Leonard,"see, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. i can spend my nights doing whatever i want."
21724,Leonard,what?
12641,Leonard,"no. no. scientists do not compromise. our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. not to mention, sheldon is batcrap crazy. "
15343,Leonard,"okay, fine. where is she going to sleep?"
16574,Leonard,"well, what difference does it make? if you’re moving back to india, we’re obviously breaking up."
20129,Leonard,"i know. and it’s not like we’re abandoning him. plus, we can facetime him whenever we want, you know, once iphones are invented in his universe."
16458,Leonard,"no offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today."
18405,Leonard,"well, for starters, you’ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?"
12859,Leonard,"that won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but physics."
14397,Leonard,hi.
21021,Leonard,"i’d say damn it in klingon, but that wasn’t until next month."
12864,Leonard,"okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women. "
19878,Leonard,really? that’s amazing. and you gave me the robes to give it in. thank you.
21653,Leonard,"leonard, call me if you’re interested in coitus. sincerely, maggie mcgeary."
19970,Leonard,"i can do that. uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it."
17742,Leonard,"right. because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two star trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. i got to get me some of that."
17485,Leonard,"thank you, amy. very touching. howard and bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. and that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. qualities that are hard to find in people these days."
14116,Leonard,"well, there’s nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails."
20444,Leonard,i stopped counting at four.
20043,Leonard,"oh, we didn’t screw around. we just got drunk and made out."
17358,Leonard,where did you get that?
18952,Leonard,"hey, you got a second?"
19272,Leonard,"i don’t, either."
18863,Leonard,aw.
13156,Leonard,yes what? 
17746,Leonard,hi.
18124,Leonard,"asthma, heart, some kind of attack. i’m fine, though."
14625,Leonard,i’ll see what i can do.
18570,Leonard,he asked me.
21102,Leonard,"fine, take the plant."
12991,Leonard,"uh, here’s the thing. girls like penny never end up with guys who own time machines. "
18233,Leonard,sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. just keep an eye on him while i’m gone.
21242,Leonard,why?
20090,Leonard,"hey, you’re early. the movie doesn’t start for an hour."
17575,Leonard,"no, raj had to go to the nurse."
18289,Leonard,you know what? you’re a crazy person.
15105,Leonard,"yeah, really."
18869,Leonard,so go to the bathroom.
18501,Leonard,there’s a principle at stake.
15028,Leonard,"for god’s sakes. sheldon, come here!"
17282,Leonard,"uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. the highest bounce wins the office."
19722,Leonard,"lots of people also didn’t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me."
19845,Leonard,hey.
21161,Leonard,"well, he doesn’t live at walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw marshmallow peeps after easter. and that’s the same man who complains you can’t find marshmallow peeps after easter."
18187,Leonard,then what is it?
21379,Leonard,yeah. maybe you and i can do something fun that weekend.
15987,Leonard,suppose there are worse ways to spend a friday night. none come to mind.
16511,Leonard,what did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
17720,Leonard,that’d be great. thank you.
18281,Leonard,"i didn’t make it back. the ship sank, i’m in hell."
20780,Leonard,wow. well done.
12717,Leonard,do you have a cousin leopold.
16351,Leonard,"thank you, officer."
13859,Leonard,"well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?"
21169,Leonard,hey.
12189,Leonard,"i’m very, very sorry."
14734,Leonard,what?
18380,Leonard,i… uh…
17302,Leonard,"sheldon, be nice."
13182,Leonard,why don’t we just go into your….
18259,Leonard,"uh-oh, hang on."
17903,Leonard,"oh, you poor thing, you’re sweating. that’s so much worse than having your car stolen."
20163,Leonard,three.
18919,Leonard,what?
14997,Leonard,"penny, i told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment."
12567,Leonard,"there’s a sniper, use your rocket launcher. "
17630,Leonard,"no. i did have a shot with the lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn’t long enough."
14338,Leonard,um…
19123,Leonard,"mm, i don’t know. who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher’s pet?"
13847,Leonard,"well, unless he’s makes one out of wood like gepetto, i don’t think it’s gonna happen."
19857,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re not in charge. raj is in charge."
17122,Leonard,that is so sweet. in 25 to 30 minutes i’m gonna show you how much this means to me.
15577,Leonard,no.
18107,Leonard,"thank you. i’m a naive idiot, right?"
13665,Leonard,i’m going to bed.
16085,Leonard,"i’m telling you, the lenwoloppali differential equation scanner meets a real need. we’ve got a hit."
20370,Leonard,"well, then you know her better than i do."
14265,Leonard,yes
13128,Leonard,"yeah, no, sure."
16875,Leonard,for all those girls out there looking for the indian monopoly man?
17288,Leonard,"if you’re not happy, why don’t you just let kripke have the office?"
21033,Leonard,where’s batman?
13225,Leonard,"dammit, sheldon! you said penny told you a secret, what was the secret."
19131,Leonard,"yeah, why would you do that?"
17259,Leonard,"joke all you want, but you think about it."
17135,Leonard,i don’t want beef jerky.
17263,Leonard,bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
17352,Leonard,"yeah, i’m glad."
21348,Leonard,that i would do to her.
16465,Leonard,"what are you gonna do, sheldon, blow up the apartment?"
13758,Leonard,"oh, yeah. it’s just a little motorcycle accident."
13183,Leonard,"no, no, i didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast. "
15887,Leonard,exactly. they say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
20476,Leonard,it can be. confetti fight. maybe you should take a break. i got this.
15806,Leonard,no-one’s going to ask if i spent the night with raj’s sister.
15687,Leonard,probably. what’s your point?
14492,Leonard,what do you mean? it’s new comic book night.
19056,Leonard,"well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh."
20502,Leonard,can you focus on what we’re talking about?
14081,Leonard,"sheldon, penny was our only hope."
13656,Leonard,maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
16741,Leonard,thank you.
21086,Leonard,does it spin around and do tricks?
16973,Leonard,yeah.
13945,Leonard,"sheldon, not now."
20614,Leonard,have you been outside in the rain with sheldon?
17400,Leonard,"oh, come on, that’s got to count. there was a really strong undertow, we could have died."
12719,Leonard,un-unravelable?
15300,Leonard,"oh, just come in!"
15312,Leonard,i guess not.
19062,Leonard,oh.
17515,Leonard,some people might say it was romantic.
18378,Leonard,"uh-huh, i can already feel it working."
14039,Leonard,"okay, that should do it."
12902,Leonard,isn’t that confusing? aa might mean something else to certain people. 
12990,Leonard,i don’t know. maybe.
12583,Leonard,so call her. 
16560,Leonard,do you really think you should be eating that cake?
19369,Leonard,look at me. dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.
13169,Leonard,"wow, that’s brilliant."
21622,Leonard,someone’s in the kitchen with dinah…
18421,Leonard,"you don’t know what a sex tape is, do you?"
18272,Leonard,the what?
21219,Leonard,thanks.
20438,Leonard,"he never disappoints, does he?"
13901,Leonard,"it was fourteen fifty, but it’s okay."
12474,Leonard,hello penny. hello kurt.
21347,Leonard,"well, she’s so excited, i can’t do that to her."
16018,Leonard,you’re jogging.
20652,Leonard,"people are coming over, it looked fun."
17844,Leonard,"hey, pretty lady."
12294,Leonard,what’s new at the cheesecake factory?
16193,Leonard,thank you.
18154,Leonard,well…
19092,Leonard,morning.
18098,Leonard,"my point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real."
20543,Leonard,"well, he’s a patent attorney. maybe his tie is pending."
21108,Leonard,"well, now they’re yours."
19965,Leonard,"oh, that’s too bad."
12011,Leonard,"sheldon, this was your idea. a little extra money to get fractional t1 bandwidth in the apartment."
13103,Leonard,"you know, before you got all swollen up, i actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party. "
16669,Leonard,"what, who told you that?"
16707,Leonard,"you left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants."
18571,Leonard,as i was saying…
15499,Leonard,alright.
13105,Leonard,howard. 
19348,Leonard,"there, perfect."
16313,Leonard,what?
19546,Leonard,"wow, you remember that?"
18029,Leonard,"don’t look under that rock.  raj, you okay?"
14710,Leonard,we must not be playing it right.
21152,Leonard,"well, it is their child."
15383,Leonard,"no, that’s okay. it was something else keeping me up last night. and again this morning. and, i didn’t mind. i was up last night. i was up this morning. i didn’t mind. those are your clues."
19917,Leonard,"oh, me."
14949,Leonard,"okay, let’s go see your psychic."
12067,Leonard,well it sounds wonderful.
16086,Leonard,what’s he doing in your apartment?
18873,Leonard,"hey. oh, how’d the audition go?"
19511,Leonard,you got it.
13759,Leonard,i don’t know. it’s all such a blur.
20027,Leonard,i’m not glowing. i’m upset.
18041,Leonard,"uh, hang on. empty your pockets."
19451,Leonard,and you found somebody you could push around?
19879,Leonard,"short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse."
20729,Leonard,way better.
19159,Leonard,whatever. you can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.
16276,Leonard,i tried in the seventh grade. i could never get used to them.
17115,Leonard,"well, i’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go."
15717,Leonard,you can’t say that anymore.
16850,Leonard,"oh, no, no, you have it wrong. no. i, i was going to be a jackass, but i stopped myself. i stayed a good guy, so, i’m gonna pass on the sex. but you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. that’s kind of my superpower. i’m, like, captain good guy."
14859,Leonard,"tushy face, that is going on twitter right now."
16480,Leonard,elegant.
18856,Leonard,"hmm, i’m a professor at stanford."
19147,Leonard,"c’mon now, throw one."
21336,Leonard,what if he lives in your garage?
12744,Leonard,get out.
15093,Leonard,you made frodo pancakes?
13530,Leonard,"thanks a lot, howard."
13716,Leonard,good.
20509,Leonard,"me, too. so, you ever think about it?"
15790,Leonard,it doesn’t?
14216,Leonard,"come on, howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero."
20981,Leonard,"oh, i don’t even know. i just liked his name. theo sassler. okay, and look at this. i even got a change maker. how much change you want, little lady?"
14145,Leonard,"terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers."
13837,Leonard,forget the robot. what happened to you?
15104,Leonard,"sheldon, at this point, i would go by myself before i would take you."
12814,Leonard,then why did i have to crawl? 
13127,Leonard,"i’m sorry, what were the choices again? "
19509,Leonard,all right. how about we start with two nights a week i live with penny?
16118,Leonard,i’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
14638,Leonard,gonna be a long night.
16096,Leonard,"don’t worry. just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers."
20508,Leonard,oh. that was really an asthma attack. i just sold it.
15668,Leonard,no. steve patterson told me.
12046,Leonard,"okay, well, make yourself at home."
19194,Leonard,it’s not that bad.
13509,Leonard,don’t worry. they only stay on your record for a year.
14419,Leonard,"yeah, that’s very comforting."
20453,Leonard,okay. thanks. hey. i think you may have dropped this?
18294,Leonard,"oh, yeah. we were meaning to do that."
16185,Leonard,are you insane? i’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
13793,Leonard,"oh, then, i think you’ll appreciate what i got you."
17697,Leonard,"oh, yeah. fifth grade. sixth grade. seventh grade. eighth grade. ninth grade."
17625,Leonard,"uh-huh. well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  so it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe."
20599,Leonard,whatcha doing?
13271,Leonard,"you know what i mean, could you just give us a little privacy?"
19923,Leonard,that was really intense.
14186,Leonard,the box says kitchen.
16449,Leonard,what kind of emergency?
20347,Leonard,"he’s not that bad. hey, stuart, got any plans thursday night?"
13894,Leonard,did you guys have an argument?
18434,Leonard,"oh, wow."
13488,Leonard,aw!
13813,Leonard,come on. wolowitz won’t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
17530,Leonard,where exactly did your mother have you tested?
13110,Leonard,why are you learning chinese?
15865,Leonard,"is that, oh, my, i didn’t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, i’m starting to exude."
20897,Leonard,"uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem."
16717,Leonard,it would be a replica of a movie prop.
20096,Leonard,your house?
18746,Leonard,name one.
17121,Leonard,i can’t believe you kept this.
14993,Leonard,don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
18620,Leonard,"so it, it’s just flirting?"
15682,Leonard,got it.
21375,Leonard,"o-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you don’t want to go and i don’t need to bring you, is everything good?"
15731,Leonard,"to be clear, i meant like bernadette, not your mother."
14767,Leonard,"oh, come on, he’s just going to play with it twice, and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk."
19431,Leonard,"sheldon, that wasn’t for you."
16281,Leonard,"hey, guys, what do you think? priya took me clothes shopping."
20125,Leonard,"i guess. i’m just, you know, worried about sheldon."
15833,Leonard,"to, uh, lucky baldwin’s."
18044,Leonard,"she’s pretty good, huh?"
16229,Leonard,whose tongue?
16296,Leonard,yeah.
19605,Leonard,why don’t we go get the food for the party.
14836,Leonard,"hey, look, it’s howard and his girlfriend bernadette."
17613,Leonard,"oh, what a nice surprise. i don’t think you’ve ever seen my lab before."
14448,Leonard,"yes, i feel terrible about it. i will never forgive myself, i don’t expect you to either, and i would really appreciate it if you would leave me with penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance."
12388,Leonard,"yeah. yeah, i guess i am. "
16820,Leonard,"so, you’re okay talking about this?"
15419,Leonard,"well, i was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. it’s kind of secret."
16051,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re not in charge. it’s my idea. i’m in charge."
15743,Leonard,hi.
14157,Leonard,"excuse me, but if i did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?"
16199,Leonard,"oh, what the hell."
12758,Leonard,just reset the board.
19462,Leonard,"wait, wait, his wing moved."
18142,Leonard,there is no season three. they cancelled that show.
20398,Leonard,no.
17671,Leonard,what?
15920,Leonard,"okay, i think a bit of context here might help."
13302,Leonard,what’s going on?
12187,Leonard,"god, this is going to be bad."
12806,Leonard,"well i can’t do it, i can’t see anything. "
17773,Leonard,what i don’t believe is that you tried to run him over.
21597,Leonard,"we all make mistakes, let’s move on."
12865,Leonard,does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
20178,Leonard,what are you doing?
16065,Leonard,no.
16425,Leonard,"well, the point is, if this got out, it would destroy howard and raj’s friendship."
13155,Leonard,i was just going off your comment about the nice guy…
14531,Leonard,is that what you want?
21084,Leonard,you’re up.
14800,Leonard,"very cool, congratulations."
13435,Leonard,yep
16804,Leonard,"will you relax? i’ll get it in a minute. hey, how was work?"
16985,Leonard,what are you talking about?
16105,Leonard,"uh, sure."
15156,Leonard,what?
19144,Leonard,"yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate."
19284,Leonard,"well, i can’t believe you’d say that. you know how insecure i am about my insecurities."
15407,Leonard,"so you agree, he’s nuts."
15046,Leonard,"i heard about this professor at mit who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer."
13391,Leonard,uh-huh.
20644,Leonard,"you know, never have i ever made love in the forest while it was raining."
21616,Leonard,"hello. hey, howard. what’s wrong? okay. okay, we’ll be right there."
14364,Leonard,"yeah, no, yeah, wow, i’m sorry. that must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear."
14885,Leonard,"no. sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?"
17266,Leonard,"uh, listen, i heard that bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup."
13055,Leonard,because she’s your sister. 
12409,Leonard,just extending the intimacy. do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
14266,Leonard,you got it.
17834,Leonard,"well, she’s not really into that kind of stuff."
21543,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re being silly."
15473,Leonard,i wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.
13875,Leonard,want some chinese food?
12872,Leonard,"well, we’re not in india. "
12168,Leonard,sheldon?
20012,Leonard,who do you think carries sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the tv?
20756,Leonard,"that is very mature of you, so i’m gonna go ahead and say, suckah."
12686,Leonard,"oh, i give up."
15111,Leonard,"do you want an allergy pill? ‘cause i have ’em all. prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental."
19908,Leonard,it came from tiffany’s.
13544,Leonard,"or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye."
14270,Leonard,"okay, let’s see. are you from a tv series?"
13905,Leonard,hey.
18301,Leonard,what’s all this?
19987,Leonard,"buddy, i’m so sorry. is there anything i can do?"
21211,Leonard,that is ridiculous. 
18367,Leonard,that sounds nice. yeah.
14019,Leonard,"all right, mother. um, have a nice flight."
19852,Leonard,squeeze yourself.
18181,Leonard,"mr. jeffries, i am so sorry. we should’ve told you about the broken elevator."
15415,Leonard,"it was the best apartment i’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way."
15120,Leonard,stan lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
19069,Leonard,that’s weird.
19533,Leonard,"howard’s right, that’ll never work."
12315,Leonard,interesting.
16551,Leonard,what are you doing here?
15329,Leonard,and i have food here. you said you were going to call.
16582,Leonard,what are you grinding about?
19841,Leonard,the most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.
13160,Leonard,"no, it’s about penny."
20810,Leonard,"okay, mom, you sit over there."
18037,Leonard,i don’t know.
20563,Leonard,what? is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?
18085,Leonard,"you know, too."
12841,Leonard,something you’d like to share? a tale of woe perhaps.
16639,Leonard,"okay, so i, i, i guess i’ll just jump right in."
13485,Leonard,pukhpa.
20748,Leonard,"hmm, atom of hydrogen, adam of maroon 5, mic drop."
13912,Leonard,was there a plan b?
14095,Leonard,i wouldn’t expect you to. i’ll see you later.
14678,Leonard,"sheldon, how do you know this stuff?"
16660,Leonard,who wants the last dumpling?
14405,Leonard,"i mean, i know she’s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that i’m going to be gone for the whole summer?"
18762,Leonard,"oh, crap. what are we gonna do?"
12154,Leonard,so penny’s a little messy.
17329,Leonard,it would be like our world of warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
15328,Leonard,i was going to see that with him.
12285,Leonard,"not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if i want to try this again."
13231,Leonard,"yes, but it’s okay. now that we know what the problem is, there’s a simple solution.  "
18476,Leonard,"yup, oh, here you go."
12792,Leonard,"you call koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours. "
20179,Leonard,we’d have to go to every party city in california.
16994,Leonard,i don’t know.
20357,Leonard,i’m really nervous.
18758,Leonard,"in fact, if you want, we can do it right here on sheldon’s spot."
14616,Leonard,"howard, you can’t hold me to that."
17216,Leonard,why is that good?
13597,Leonard,"listen, i need to talk to you about something."
14071,Leonard,szechuan palace closed two years ago.
14139,Leonard,so?
15656,Leonard,"you know, you never told me what happened between you and bernadette."
12928,Leonard,here’s your tee-shirt.  
18577,Leonard,"well, congrats, and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister."
17725,Leonard,"well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. i’m, i’m way above average in a lot of other things."
13230,Leonard,"first i want to say that it’s not sheldon’s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave. "
14433,Leonard,thank you. bye.
19294,Leonard,yeah i don’t want something dumb like money to come between us.
15827,Leonard,"sheldon, i don’t need an alibi. nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  thankyou. now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. (sheldon writes “i doubt it” on leonard’s whiteboard."
21360,Leonard,"oh, why? do you not want to go?"
15167,Leonard,you always get your way.
14519,Leonard,what?
19686,Leonard,i don’t even know what you’re talking about and i agree.
20786,Leonard,is your brother out of prison?
14523,Leonard,i bet i could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
14350,Leonard,nothing. we just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. i’m gonna make a coffee run. do you want any?
13173,Leonard,"oh. okay. but before you say anything, have you ever heard of schrodinger’s cat? "
17287,Leonard,"sheldon, relax."
15251,Leonard,get into what? why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? they’ve been in your life a long time. they make you happy. they deserve to know.
20867,Leonard,"which means i won’t be able to make penny breakfast every day, and she’ll realize my brioche french toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage."
15339,Leonard,kidding. just a couple of friends goofin’ around.
14570,Leonard,"i was just thinking, we should probably turn in too."
21045,Leonard,"oh, hey, sheldon."
13790,Leonard,merry christmas.
12741,Leonard,why not? 
12671,Leonard,"yes.  my name is dr leonard hofstadter, and i could never please my parents so i need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. but he’s worse."
21589,Leonard,"what, what, what, what, what? "
15571,Leonard,uh-huh.
15337,Leonard,oh. sure. absolutely.
20026,Leonard,"okay, listen, i may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift."
17816,Leonard,"you see those, too."
20990,Leonard,"okay, let’s keep it moving."
16266,Leonard,"oh, the ancient romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls."
18330,Leonard,it’s just a bunch of pants.
12838,Leonard,not heavy ones. 
19583,Leonard,do it.
13732,Leonard,"yeah, stephanie got it for me. it’s kind of fun."
15098,Leonard,"sheldon, i need to talk to you."
12614,Leonard,who’s running the red corvette?
19324,Leonard,"all right, i’ll get rid of him. but you owe me one."
18978,Leonard,what?
21080,Leonard,let it fly.
14703,Leonard,"oh, i guess so."
16004,Leonard,"i got a better idea. we’re all responsible. i say we all go. come on, who’s with me? free comic books to anyone who comes with me. i might get punched. you really want to miss that?"
19697,Leonard,can we please just stop talking about it?
12552,Leonard,"here’s an idea, why don’t we just go out for indian food."
12220,Leonard,"no, i can’t look at you or your avatar right now."
20682,Leonard,sorry?
20082,Leonard,"good. because i’ve loved you since the moment we met, and i will keep loving you until the end of time."
12609,Leonard,"okay, the x10s are online."
14274,Leonard,"okay, then let’s do this, lets go to las vegas."
18894,Leonard,sounds rough.
16682,Leonard,i’m sorry. the bride and groom seem happy.
20912,Leonard,"thanks for understanding, sir."
20516,Leonard,"well, just don’t get anything jurassic. he feels like that whole chunk of time has gone hollywood. hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking batman was coming to his party."
17381,Leonard,like it was ten hours ago. what about it?
16284,Leonard,just two. everyday and dress.
12263,Leonard,great. did we say a time?
14228,Leonard,"penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. stuart’s a terrific artist. he went to the rhode island school of design."
15877,Leonard,what?
13552,Leonard,what’s the emergency?
14633,Leonard,"well, i sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex, and during, i was trying to remember what i read on google, so…"
12878,Leonard,"yeah, we really ruined his life. "
20720,Leonard,hey.
12338,Leonard,"mum’s the word. sheldon, are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to gablehauser and get your job back."
18155,Leonard,really?
12566,Leonard,"that will do, raj, straight for the tank."
14054,Leonard,"don’t you dare, missy."
15004,Leonard,"yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant."
13381,Leonard,sorry.
16690,Leonard,i did have a great time. thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.
12502,Leonard,"here, let me try. call mcflono mcfloonyloo. heh-heh. "
20731,Leonard,why didn’t you say something?
16270,Leonard,long before the cats. i think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. i still have some of the currency.
17242,Leonard,it’s not funny. that mistake got published.
17275,Leonard,"all right, this is one-on-one. first person to five wins the office. any questions? yes, sheldon?"
21617,Leonard,"oh, hi, steph, come on in."
20209,Leonard,and tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?
12043,Leonard,"anyway, um. we brought home indian food. and, um. i know that moving can be stressful, and i find that when i’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. also, curry is a natural laxative, and i don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about."
12328,Leonard,you’re making eggs for breakfast?
17177,Leonard,great. good. great. what are you reading?
14386,Leonard,"easy peasy, i’m doing it right now."
19940,Leonard,"okay, two friends each."
13594,Leonard,are you sure?
15139,Leonard,"oh, no, that’s terrible. ooh, the line’s moving. got to go. bye."
15445,Leonard,we’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
15618,Leonard,"i assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of penny’s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of slim jims and the latest issue of bombay badonkadonks."
16992,Leonard,no.
17055,Leonard,"next time, you should open with that."
16692,Leonard,"well, okay. again, thank you."
21582,Leonard,sorry.
18288,Leonard,"so now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising."
15518,Leonard,"uh, it’s what controls the arm."
20202,Leonard,"afraid so, skippy."
19346,Leonard,"you know, if you’re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons."
19588,Leonard,do you really want him to write back?
14770,Leonard,"uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock."
16386,Leonard,"something’s wrong, i’m not getting any gas. anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?"
14906,Leonard,you’re my surrogate family?
20607,Leonard,"uh, hufflepuff, from harry potter."
17693,Leonard,"because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him."
16070,Leonard,what are you doing?
13812,Leonard,i need you to apologize to how…
20536,Leonard,"yeah, uh, um, penny and i got married."
15587,Leonard,"penny, steve wozniak was one of the cofounders of apple computer. he and steve jobs started it…"
15543,Leonard,"no, no, don’t ask."
18466,Leonard,"he did bite me once. but in his defence, i came up behind him while he was eating, so…"
19750,Leonard,"no, but i don’t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me."
20590,Leonard,they bought it.
15966,Leonard,no hurry.
14231,Leonard,"uh, cut it in half?"
17850,Leonard,what do you mean?
13592,Leonard,on what?
12032,Leonard,"great. well, bye."
20557,Leonard,"i want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes."
21303,Leonard,"sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. just help us out."
20491,Leonard,there’s no reason you can’t.
16867,Leonard,did you try calling her on the telephone?
12600,Leonard,"doctor and mrs koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn’t entirely raj’s fault. "
19807,Leonard,"yes, it is, wil."
21155,Leonard,"penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep."
14006,Leonard,"of course she did. anyway, that’s not what i was gonna say. when i was ten years old, i built a hugging machine."
14418,Leonard,i don’t think i can go to the north pole.
15005,Leonard,i haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third matrix movie.
17553,Leonard,not gonna happen.
15257,Leonard,"all right, maybe i overreacted. so we’re in two different places emotionally. so what? and maybe i’m a little ahead of you. that’s fine. you know. in fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, i’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you."
21151,Leonard,"come on, everyone to the hospital."
18536,Leonard,come on.
19781,Leonard,psst.
15118,Leonard,will you please turn your shirt off?
17496,Leonard,"well, hang on. why do you believe that he knows what it is and i don’t?"
18102,Leonard,yup.
14547,Leonard,what was that?
12706,Leonard,"i couldn’t say that, i would have to say, you were terrific and i can’t wait to hear you sing again. "
12919,Leonard,"fine. here i go, taking one for the team. in the sack. hey leslie."
12357,Leonard,really? what happened?
21403,Leonard,did you know raj moved out last night?
14035,Leonard,and the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
16433,Leonard,"yeah, raj, why?"
12120,Leonard,"anyway, i’ve learned my lesson. she’s out of my league, i’m done with her, i’ve got my work, one day i’ll win the nobel prize and then i’ll die alone."
16711,Leonard,could you tell us?
12607,Leonard,"i don’t believe it, what’s gotten into him? "
19442,Leonard,a slim jim?
20678,Leonard,no.
14396,Leonard,i’m in.
18714,Leonard,"i swear, i am on your side. "
13701,Leonard,hey.
20727,Leonard,what’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
17354,Leonard,"i’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?"
17002,Leonard,no.
17439,Leonard,"i’m sorry. i did, i crossed a line. i didn’t mean to!"
15904,Leonard,"howard, you talk to him. howard? you’re peeing, aren’t you?"
19912,Leonard,"yeah, you’re right. that is the term i’m looking for. you are a dirty double mother suckler."
20687,Leonard,"oh, well, then you’ll enjoy this. bernadette does the same thing with you and koothrappali."
17857,Leonard,please forgive me. i should have told you about alex.
12742,Leonard,"there is no leo, how can you say that? "
18899,Leonard,"oh, my god, you’re jealous."
12723,Leonard,so he goes back into rehab?
16610,Leonard,you’re leaving?
13984,Leonard,"sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. she’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training."
14252,Leonard,"wait, so we just go over there?"
13913,Leonard,"it’s probably not as bad as you think. let’s take a look. maybe we can find some corners to cut. oh, here’s something, if you don’t have electricity, then you probably don’t need cable. just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?"
12708,Leonard,well now you are.
13132,Leonard,"elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop? "
19309,Leonard,he tried to score with penny.
20289,Leonard,"your birthday is december 2, you grew up on perkins street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero."
17337,Leonard,"oh. i guess i was hoping for a different reaction, but okay."
14513,Leonard,okay-dokay.
13931,Leonard,really? you’re just gonna let me go by myself?
15256,Leonard,"what? no, it’s okay. we don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. everything’s good."
16372,Leonard,"oh, geez, i don’t know if i can ditch priya two nights in a row."
17347,Leonard,"uh, it is, but i think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny.  i was wrong, it’s still funny."
21226,Leonard,"its not that i’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. they start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable."
20174,Leonard,let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.
13573,Leonard,i’m going out for a while.
12629,Leonard,"not only is he still not talking to me, but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. you know, like in the classic sci-fi movie scanners?  you know, bzzz-pchew! never mind. how about this one. it says, “i know my physics, but i’m still a fun guy!”"
19347,Leonard,bruce wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.
15702,Leonard,why not?
19725,Leonard,"right now, i’m just trying to burp without throwing up."
15405,Leonard,can i sleep on your couch tonight?
17949,Leonard,hissy fits? i have hissy fits?
13857,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon."
12611,Leonard,"no, no, no, you don’t get it, um, howard, enable public access. "
12503,Leonard,so? we’ll start now.
16072,Leonard,"no, you are now nothing. you have no connection to this project whatsoever."
21056,Leonard,"i’m married, i don’t have to be attractive."
18428,Leonard,"oh, my god, is she okay?"
16238,Leonard,i guess you’re right. see you later.
16064,Leonard,no.
15171,Leonard,"it’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it."
14345,Leonard,"good, good. well, you kids have fun tonight."
20314,Leonard,how does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
19101,Leonard,i’ll be there as soon as i can.
14821,Leonard,"let me guess, motion sensors?"
17407,Leonard,"oh, yeah, no worries."
21677,Leonard,what?
14845,Leonard,i believe you.
17639,Leonard,"ja, und later she’s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light."
18334,Leonard,"hey, i am every bit as much of a man as penny. now, let’s do this."
12832,Leonard,"so, dennis, how long have you been in america."
13318,Leonard,"well, i-i-i-it’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment."
13553,Leonard,"wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?"
12543,Leonard,we can’t order chinese food without wolowitz?
12069,Leonard,should i say something? i feel like i should say something.
21133,Leonard,we lived together 13 years. how can you be so awful to me?
14499,Leonard,"all i know is, it wasn’t the way i dreamed it would be."
15209,Leonard,"my mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and i’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently."
16373,Leonard,"aw, screw it. i’m in."
14756,Leonard,"well, i can’t read your mind, penny!"
12537,Leonard,"oh, no, it’s 6:30 in the morning."
17039,Leonard,"yeah, just back there."
19295,Leonard,should we go?
17585,Leonard,in what universe is that a present?
16714,Leonard,"yeah, real big of you."
16334,Leonard,"well, uh, not far. hey, if you ever wanna start a family, la cañada has some great schools."
12852,Leonard,pretty sure.
13322,Leonard,"she’s gotten really hooked on age of conan, she’s playing non-stop."
14428,Leonard,what did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me?
15006,Leonard,"here, you want my peas?"
20964,Leonard,how can you stop now? that’s like walking out of pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.
15245,Leonard,i’m walking away from you now.
13506,Leonard,"oh, i’ll make a motion, but you’re not going to like it."
14017,Leonard,"come on, you’re trying to have sex with your father, and i’m okay with that."
20561,Leonard,they’ve been out there a while.
12593,Leonard,um… raj.
17527,Leonard,why?
17256,Leonard,"it doesn’t matter what i say, you’re gonna tell me anyway."
15627,Leonard,i think sheldon really misses amy.
14486,Leonard,you know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
16860,Leonard,"fine. what would you like to talk about, sheldon?"
17748,Leonard,"i do, of course i do."
18308,Leonard,stop yelling at me.
21602,Leonard,sorry.
17240,Leonard,five.
20630,Leonard,"what, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?"
20089,Leonard,yeah.
16929,Leonard,i know what you’re doing.
17416,Leonard,"actually, you did do one of them together."
18273,Leonard,"come on, i said i was sorry."
18018,Leonard,i’m not saying that.
21660,Leonard,i think he’s getting worse.
18483,Leonard,"i’m sorry. i’ll, i’ll take care of it."
14434,Leonard,damn it.
20337,Leonard,"guys, tickets already went on sale."
20648,Leonard,i thought you were back with emily.
16338,Leonard,"not really, no."
14489,Leonard,yeah?
17326,Leonard,"oh, i don’t know. i kind of promised myself i’d get off the computer, be more physically active. get some exercise."
13865,Leonard,"okay, if you’re gonna start sniffing people, i’m gonna go get a hot pretzel."
19737,Leonard,sure.
13802,Leonard,"howard, why don’t we just work on the robot?"
18834,Leonard,"at least they talked about you on letterman. come on, i can drive you wherever you need to go."
16880,Leonard,her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
12254,Leonard,"it doesn’t matter. the woman’s not interested in me, the woman rejected me. "
17018,Leonard,sheldon.
20584,Leonard,"oh. sorry, we can’t."
13741,Leonard,"did… okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. he got lucky."
21005,Leonard,"it’s cute, they’re having fun living together."
17172,Leonard,"uh, red means fix right away. yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. and green is i could probably learn to live with it. there’s a key down here at the bottom. it’s neat, huh?"
15604,Leonard,"listen, can i talk to you about your girlfriend?"
14103,Leonard,at least he’s off the train crap.
14520,Leonard,"schnapps. you’re right, that is fun."
16844,Leonard,no.
12894,Leonard,"i was actually the one who noticed, okay, let’s just start. "
12246,Leonard,"you proposed the experiment, i think you should present your findings first."
12380,Leonard,really?
13850,Leonard,"i don’t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? proximity and valence electrons."
12694,Leonard,"yes, i did. "
17853,Leonard,i’m missing something.  did you say something to penny about alex?
21441,Leonard,"well, i mean, i’m sitting right here. you’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation."
16658,Leonard,"no, you listen. you’re my woman, and i’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before."
20104,Leonard,"let’s see, a lever, a lever."
12371,Leonard,"lesley? no, no-oh, what are you kidding?"
12749,Leonard,oh…!
13276,Leonard,"no, changs."
17162,Leonard,"well, technically, this would be an alpha test. a beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…"
20136,Leonard,"hey, ready for lunch?"
16484,Leonard,got it. bye.
17838,Leonard,working it? you can’t even talk to her.
15460,Leonard,have they found a match for you?
15645,Leonard,"no, no, it’s not like that. it’s, uh, i don’t know what it’s like. but there is something i should prepare you for."
16863,Leonard,"amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?"
18269,Leonard,"i’m sorry, sheldon. i should’ve told you i was back. i just wanted to have a couple days alone with penny."
14437,Leonard,dinner’s ready!
17919,Leonard,hmm. kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and bernadette.
12789,Leonard,"affirmative, with fever."
20011,Leonard,"no, no, no. hang on. i believe i’m supposed to carry you across the threshold."
20413,Leonard,"sheldon, i accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. i’m not in a position to just say you can come."
13478,Leonard,the bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.
17738,Leonard,"hey, alex, and call me leonard. dr. hofstadter is my father. and my mother. and my sister. and our cat. although, i’m pretty sure dr. boots hofstadter’s degree was honorary."
13827,Leonard,"oh, please, we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. personally, i can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size."
18208,Leonard,"all right, amy, it’s your turn. we need one more hit. finish him off."
20341,Leonard,"i’m also really happy, but i can’t pretend it’s for you. new star wars in three days."
15152,Leonard,"no. but there is an original final draft ghostbusters script with actual slime stains!  oh, you’re right, it’s ghostbusters 2. never mind."
14337,Leonard,hey stuart.
21511,Leonard,"we covered this, i’m dumb."
16149,Leonard,really? what do we tell siebert?
14482,Leonard,we came to apologize.
17843,Leonard,what do you guys think i should do?
19079,Leonard,then what can i do?
17103,Leonard,"no, i’m not."
20427,Leonard,really? the old asian man is not your meemaw?
12422,Leonard,"oh, to be honest, i don’t think it’s going to work out. "
18032,Leonard,"nope, just, just, whoa."
18755,Leonard,"it gets better. instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it."
15657,Leonard,"yeah, i guessed that."
20520,Leonard,he is?
13024,Leonard,maybe she’s his lawyer.
13426,Leonard,"i wonder a lot of things about you, sheldon, but not… not that."
20457,Leonard,see if you can get a table by the window.
17412,Leonard,sheldon…
18696,Leonard,no.
21535,Leonard,"she might disappear, but she’s definitely not cleaning anything."
13751,Leonard,"actually, he’s pretty cool. i mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he’s a black diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band."
12662,Leonard,"so, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.  are there any questions?"
17699,Leonard,we’re not standing outside by the u-haul while you fondle yourself.
18131,Leonard,"well, well, well, sheldon, fancy meeting you here. i guess the train store in glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all. and you, you said you weren’t coming here, either."
16645,Leonard,"okay, like usual. good."
14074,Leonard,i thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
18374,Leonard,"look, i mean, i’m not proud of it, but it does work. i got her to watch a six-part documentary on monty python. even i was bored, i just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end."
16273,Leonard,"mm-hmm. great. hey, can i ask you something?"
21273,Leonard,we owe you an apology.
20093,Leonard,this was feynman’s van? that’s so cool.
14416,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s me."
20572,Leonard,good. slow.
20098,Leonard,"if there was a hidden compartment, don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?"
15580,Leonard,i almost died!
16543,Leonard,"well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled macy’s day balloon."
19237,Leonard,"guys, what are we doing? we sent the girls away so we could focus."
16566,Leonard,mmm. mmm.
20275,Leonard,"i don’t know if you want to do that, i was just, okay, never mind."
13884,Leonard,"well, it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and i don’t see a sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a sheldon-approved theatre."
14969,Leonard,"we’re fine, sheldon."
20046,Leonard,"if you don’t mind waiting for a groupon, we can try marriage counselling."
12791,Leonard,i tried to stop you. 
12934,Leonard,"you’re never going to let that go, are you? "
12995,Leonard,"oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine. "
16402,Leonard,"boy, you sure get your money’s worth out of these games."
18262,Leonard,"we finished the experiment early, so i thought i’d come home and surprise you."
19422,Leonard,that’s a nice way of looking at it.
20684,Leonard,"penny, but…"
13975,Leonard,i’ll start again.
19897,Leonard,"of course not. she’s, she’s just a very sweet and god-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs."
13598,Leonard,"oh, hey, guys."
18682,Leonard,hey.
17181,Leonard,i called your dad. i asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. this seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
20662,Leonard,can you please talk to him?
13624,Leonard,it’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.
21208,Leonard,"hey, what’s going on with you?"
19846,Leonard,we want you back on the project with us.
17504,Leonard,"so, where exactly are we in this relationship?"
20193,Leonard,"before i answer, may i just say your skin has never looked better."
21130,Leonard,"uh, theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?"
15939,Leonard,"i’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened."
14661,Leonard,"well, you know, i just noticed i haven’t really met any of them."
18997,Leonard,"it only gets funnier when you explain it, sheldon."
18580,Leonard,"i know, it’s crazy. welcome to the thunderdome, people. "
17207,Leonard,there. done.
17328,Leonard,"you mean, are you talking gaming marathon?"
17584,Leonard,"batman. batman and robin. uh, wonder twins plus the monkey. wonder twins plus the monkey and batman."
12480,Leonard,"no, penny, it’s okay, i can handle this. i’m not a dwarf, i’m a hobbit. a hobbit. are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?"
13542,Leonard,"well, five is partway between three… never mind."
12618,Leonard,forget the parties.
14196,Leonard,i think you look fantastic.
16589,Leonard,"please. sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals."
18175,Leonard,"sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. and a sleepy sheldon is a cranky sheldon. and a cranky sheldon is actually no different than a regular sheldon. good night."
14250,Leonard,what about the ones in the corner?
15019,Leonard,"me, too, but i paid three bucks for it."
16102,Leonard,"it was a late-night vote. we were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. it’s not technically road trip god, it’s travel supervisor."
18254,Leonard,what was what?
16547,Leonard,"so, what’s your news, bernadette?"
15523,Leonard,a lot of people are working on that research. so what is all this?
14833,Leonard,i am. are you interested in physics?
13970,Leonard,yes.
17185,Leonard,i play a lot of grand theft auto. i think i know how to handle a gat.
12482,Leonard,i think i’ve made my point.
14615,Leonard,"oh, yeah."
20898,Leonard,you don’t.
18036,Leonard,the surf and turf sounds good. see if they have corn on the cob.
20418,Leonard,that raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?
15725,Leonard,the volcano thing? no.
17867,Leonard,"message received. ah, excuse me.  hello. this is dr. hofstadter. okay. all right, thank you. that’s weird. i’m getting called in to human resources."
17428,Leonard,you must be burning up.
15983,Leonard,no. what happened?
13015,Leonard,"still, i think it’s time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life. "
15086,Leonard,"come on, sheldon. can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?"
12805,Leonard,raj?
13158,Leonard,yeah. that’s the spirit. 
16041,Leonard,"i was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we’ll have ourselves an app to sell."
12800,Leonard,"yeah, at home. "
13881,Leonard,hmmm.
14716,Leonard,"no, you didn’t."
21067,Leonard,"yeah, good for you."
13034,Leonard,so it’s settled. you’ll stay with us.
21292,Leonard,"yeah. go ahead, open it."
17512,Leonard,i’m good.
12876,Leonard,"well, why do we go home alone every night, we’re still smart. "
15417,Leonard,do i get some sympathy now?
21097,Leonard,"oh, it was a good one. he played poker with sir isaac, you don’t care."
21061,Leonard,"i’m sorry, is that a yes?"
17169,Leonard,"oh, wait, here, almost forgot. here."
20814,Leonard,"sure, dad."
15369,Leonard,"okay, well, i guess i should get dressed so i can take everyone to work. you and sheldon and sheldon’s friend, dr. plimpton, who you just met. it’ll be fun. like a clown car."
17786,Leonard,"look at that, i built a fireplace with my own two hands."
17462,Leonard,i noticed you never answered me.
18236,Leonard,"there’s beer in the fridge. anyway, you guys really don’t need to make a big deal."
18091,Leonard,"okay, my turn. your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did."
14941,Leonard,and that didn’t bother you?
18876,Leonard,"yeah. i had higher hopes for a movie called serial ape-ist 2: monkey see, monkey kill. you know, it’s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie."
17976,Leonard,"well, too late, pal. i’m not going anywhere. penny and i are very happy living together. isn’t that right?"
20942,Leonard,eh.
15922,Leonard,that was odd.
13558,Leonard,then why did you?
13365,Leonard,good night.
17070,Leonard,"you know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them."
16063,Leonard,we’re not wasting time with names right now.
18713,Leonard,"for some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with sheldon forever."
16268,Leonard,"aw, hell, i miss him."
19190,Leonard,"okay, him i believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. but you’re just upset about stuart and your mom and all their hbos."
19906,Leonard,"so, mom, you haven’t seen penny since we got engaged."
20712,Leonard,"fine. preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing."
14826,Leonard,i think it upsets sheldon when you play with the food.
20758,Leonard,"penny’s busy with my mother, so i’m in."
15149,Leonard,"we were on our way to the chinese restaurant when we thought we saw adam west, so we followed him."
20213,Leonard,what?
13378,Leonard,you’re welcome.
15346,Leonard,"she’s here, she’s here. how do i look? do i look smart?"
13557,Leonard,"yeah, i am loyal. you know, if you look at the big picture. just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?"
19662,Leonard,"no, i got you something for valentine’s day, and i was too embarrassed to give it to you."
12769,Leonard,i don’t think so.
19268,Leonard,"you know what, you don’t have to give me this. you keep it."
12318,Leonard,"i know, i’m familiar with you."
13768,Leonard,"actually, science is my lady."
20439,Leonard,hey.
12272,Leonard,"by the way, if it should ever come up, you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at quizznos. "
18482,Leonard,"okay, sheldon, i know i was supposed to return this dvd a long time ago, and i know we rented it on your card. but it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. so in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?"
17647,Leonard,"oh. that’s great. great, great, great. why wait so long to tell me?"
13037,Leonard,"yeah, no, i do, i use those… uh… just to polish up my… spear-fishing equipment. i spear fish. when i’m not crossbow hunting, i spear fish. uh, penny, this is sheldon’s twin sister, missy. missy, this is our neighbour penny."
21573,Leonard,i’ll do the talking.
14942,Leonard,"what am i supposed to do, pretend i believe something i don’t whenever i’m with penny?"
20753,Leonard,"hmm, i just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond."
15084,Leonard,"got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? think it’s gonna rain? instead of underpants, i covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. thoughts? okay, i know what’ll cheer you up, let’s play one of your driving games."
15814,Leonard,"my point is, priya’s gone. and it would be much better if no-one else found out about this."
16444,Leonard,that’s great.
15660,Leonard,"okay. well, how about this? kidnap bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you."
21364,Leonard,"uh, it’s more complicated than that."
19721,Leonard,you’re being ridiculous.
12222,Leonard,"oh, right, right right right right."
13356,Leonard,no.
14688,Leonard,what’s wrong with a football jersey?
12904,Leonard,"well, you’re a friend, and you like batman, and cookies, and you’re off the team. "
17854,Leonard,why would you do that?
20200,Leonard,my friend does make a decent point about the money. i don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
16793,Leonard,sorry.
13323,Leonard,"sheldon, wake up."
15298,Leonard,what the hell was that about?
19504,Leonard,"come on, don’t get upset."
18485,Leonard,and you’re going to stay calm?
19481,Leonard,i wasn’t gonna get beat up.
16841,Leonard,that actually does help.
17556,Leonard,smooth. hi.
17965,Leonard,harry and ginny get together?
17815,Leonard,fine. you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. there are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
13844,Leonard,there you go. now any e-mail from wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
15532,Leonard,what’s a dogapus?
14217,Leonard,you’re joking.
18028,Leonard,sorry. maybe next year. i’m just kidding. romance ninja. let’s have sex. waugh!
13967,Leonard,"here’s your tea, mother."
13008,Leonard,"it’s not a bidding war, i’m selling it all to larry down at the comic book store. "
17879,Leonard,"hey, will you steam my uniform next?"
12377,Leonard,thank you.
17670,Leonard,i quit.
11999,Leonard,"okay, maybe later."
17617,Leonard,"no, it’s a nitrogen laser. it’ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg."
18996,Leonard,i don’t know. the bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in schindler’s list is tough to beat.
16995,Leonard,i told you. that was a different guy.
17789,Leonard,"oh, come on, i hardly ever get a chance to play anymore."
20495,Leonard,the same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. you.
17235,Leonard,"so, do i get breakfast in bed on leonard’s day?"
16151,Leonard,more than this?
15202,Leonard,"sheldon, you’re being ridiculous."
20675,Leonard,"oh, i just ran out of patience with sheldon’s nonsense."
19253,Leonard,it really does hold up.
14384,Leonard,"sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death."
13683,Leonard,"i did. it was right here. she must’ve… oh, my god, we’re living together."
16052,Leonard,"well, yes, and you’re listed as chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief operating officer."
17178,Leonard,"they kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? all right. look, just remember how this works. we don’t get mad about these things. uh, speaking of which, i’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. got a really fun evening for you. it’s kind of a surprise."
18744,Leonard,"i say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses."
19313,Leonard,i don’t know that i’d call myself an infection.
12264,Leonard,and that’s still good for you.
20587,Leonard,what are we gonna tell the girls?
12267,Leonard,"to… carve the… okay, i’ll see you six thirty."
15980,Leonard,no.
19684,Leonard,yeah.
17865,Leonard,"with all these women chasing me, i kind of do feel like captain kirk."
19829,Leonard,"whatever. there’s no alphas here, and this is your project. you’re in charge. how do you want to start?"
12342,Leonard,"i didn’t know what else to do, he’s lost all focus, every day he’s got a new obsession.  this is a particularly disturbing one. "
20264,Leonard,so you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?
19424,Leonard,"then, of course, rubbing our success in sheldon’s face."
17921,Leonard,maybe it’s a shipping problem.
17077,Leonard,"no, i mean just you and me."
18861,Leonard,in a minute. i don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any i have in science.
16626,Leonard,"oh, i miss you, too."
19868,Leonard,"yeah, looks like there’s a big storm all up the east coast."
18512,Leonard,"aaaah! i, you, how can, what!"
16822,Leonard,"you know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then i would be fine with that."
17632,Leonard,nothing.
14812,Leonard,are you really admitting defeat?
14545,Leonard,"sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?"
13599,Leonard,"hi, howard. howard?"
16231,Leonard,"okay, i’m out of here."
20028,Leonard,"sure, let’s make it an even hundred."
16169,Leonard,"oh, good, good."
13140,Leonard,"aw, good for me. where are you going?"
13578,Leonard,"uh, yeah."
20799,Leonard,"this is sheldon’s mother, mary."
19610,Leonard,that would be great.
19405,Leonard,"hey. hey, we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important."
19577,Leonard,"oh, the pleasure is mine, mr. innovative. uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. do you hear that, mr. out-of-the?"
15908,Leonard,we really want to see this. is there anything you can do?
17258,Leonard,"absolutely not. if i’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with ryan gosling, then leonard gots to get paid. so, you think about us getting married?"
21174,Leonard,"oh, yeah? and you thought spock ears were only good for comic-con."
17715,Leonard,what did he say?
13994,Leonard,fine. let’s go. i think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. i’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the italians.
14851,Leonard,you told her my experiment was stupid?
12643,Leonard,"because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit. "
15851,Leonard,"no, seriously, i think i’ve finally figured out my problem with women."
17062,Leonard,"no, i can’t. i’m playing grand theft auto later. look, i’m no expert in women."
19065,Leonard,i haven’t heard from sheldon in a while. you think he’s okay?
16406,Leonard,sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.
15560,Leonard,this is ridiculous. i’m coming to talk to you.
21158,Leonard,i’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. that was a big milestone for me.
19862,Leonard,"mm, i thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. i even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me."
15758,Leonard,"the hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. so, priya, what brings you back to la?"
17296,Leonard,have you ever seen them?
18500,Leonard,"oh, i’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so i can return the dvd and see the look on sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that i didn’t let this get to me."
16883,Leonard,really? amy?
20671,Leonard,stop saying meeting.
20366,Leonard,what if i get caught?
14284,Leonard,"uh, raj, can i, can i talk to you for a moment."
15513,Leonard,how about an acetylene torch?
17372,Leonard,"well, you should talk to stuart."
15147,Leonard,"uh, well, we didn’t actually get chinese food."
15843,Leonard,you put moths in my food?
15461,Leonard,why not?
16311,Leonard,"maybe, but that’s not my problem. she’s not my girlfriend, you are."
12949,Leonard,some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it. 
12329,Leonard,huh? cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
17924,Leonard,"well, sometimes there’s a secret ending, like in the avengers."
19104,Leonard,"oh, right."
17041,Leonard,yeah.
21585,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, i’ve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don’t…."
19995,Leonard,you sure?
21684,Leonard,"hey. i’m sorry, we’re still here. is everything okay?"
21591,Leonard,hey.
17040,Leonard,yeah. it kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
14894,Leonard,mitzy’s dead?
16800,Leonard,"no, i don’t think i picked her up. besides, i have a girlfriend."
12646,Leonard,yeah. everything since the eighth grade. 
13762,Leonard,"yeah, we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector."
17986,Leonard,"what do you mean, why? it’s valentine’s day."
21184,Leonard,yeah?
20194,Leonard,that must be him.
14344,Leonard,"yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break."
16203,Leonard,"no, i didn’t do it for the money."
16897,Leonard,"you know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up."
13706,Leonard,"okay, um, well, look, it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick."
20245,Leonard,just like you.
12304,Leonard,"yeah, i’m okay. did you spill ketchup?"
16383,Leonard,"you’re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a fedex box. "
19608,Leonard,"oh yeah, look at that."
15384,Leonard,no.
14413,Leonard,"oh, wow, cool."
21382,Leonard,"no. he can’t afford his apartment, and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. i want to say india, but it seems mean."
21779,Leonard,a bad thing. a very bad thing. get the door. get the door! get the door! get the door! get the door!
18362,Leonard,some sports bar. it’s like they never even heard of quidditch. do we really have to go?
20222,Leonard,you know what? it’s fine. keep the money. we just want to be done with this.
19383,Leonard,hey. what’re you working on?
17577,Leonard,isn’t that enough? it had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. what more do you want?
21625,Leonard,"dude, check it out. that’s laundry for a month!"
21454,Leonard,you did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.
17767,Leonard,sheldon?
16617,Leonard,"listen, i don’t want to be rude, but priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…"
13828,Leonard,you want to prepare him? install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
16901,Leonard,"movies, yes."
12158,Leonard,what are you doing?
19300,Leonard,"no, but you can have mine."
12589,Leonard,"look, penny, we’d love to help you, but raj is going through some stuff right now. and besides, he doesn’t drink, so…  really? um, raj is going through some stuff right now and he’d like to take up drinking. "
14495,Leonard,it’s not a matter of opportunity. we’re getting to know each other. there’s a learning curve.
20404,Leonard,"that’s fine, ’cause actually you’re not invited."
18410,Leonard,that’s beautiful. is that shakespeare?
17902,Leonard,yes.
20934,Leonard,"hey, sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear."
19228,Leonard,"you know, let’s just come up with something new."
16939,Leonard,"interesting. so now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me."
15433,Leonard,"okay, i’m sorry."
17023,Leonard,"come on, guys."
13737,Leonard,"raj, please, let’s stay serious here. superman’s body is kryptonian, therefore his sweat is kryptonian."
19881,Leonard,"a, surprised you know that. b, i wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you."
18906,Leonard,"what about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?"
15512,Leonard,"you do what you want, i’m not touching another man’s honey tree."
16315,Leonard,yep.
15997,Leonard,they might be smarter than some people.
14498,Leonard,"to tell you the truth, i think we were both a little, i don’t know…"
19478,Leonard,thank you.
16526,Leonard,i don’t care. i don’t have anything to hide.
13831,Leonard,"what’s this do, spin?"
18128,Leonard,i know. i was hoping to go without anyone finding out.
14526,Leonard,"right, right. you’re saying you talked to penny?"
20034,Leonard,hey.
13978,Leonard,"so, mother, what’s new?"
14864,Leonard,"mmm, in a way. we presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other."
14277,Leonard,"great, we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt."
13675,Leonard,we’re not living together.
15246,Leonard,"oh, hey."
20550,Leonard,thank you for your time.
15044,Leonard,you understand why i’m doing this to you?
18761,Leonard,"it’s a little late, but i’ll take it."
16321,Leonard,"sheldon, that computer is used for national defence. hacking into it is a federal crime."
12874,Leonard,the kid got a girl. 
16291,Leonard,"no, no, i’m confident. it’s not like i’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. although, this will be the first time i’ll be the one saying it."
15267,Leonard,we really need a strike here.
13313,Leonard,"you mean, up until now we’ve been experiencing the happy funtime sheldon?"
21452,Leonard,"i got to admit, we didn’t think you’d be able to do two things at once."
18310,Leonard,"no, because i didn’t want her on my team."
20361,Leonard,how was your day?
21520,Leonard,"well, i don’t love it, but if you really want to take this job, i’ll find a way to deal with it."
18676,Leonard,i know.
12078,Leonard,excuse me?
15601,Leonard,"ah, ah."
14481,Leonard,"uh, yes, ma’am."
20617,Leonard,i don’t think i’ve lit a real fire before.
20477,Leonard,"hey, raj, i read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?"
16475,Leonard,"okay, see you later."
19105,Leonard,"all right, fine. hey, can you think of a reason i shouldn’t invite amy to come with me?"
13350,Leonard,"close enough, come on.  hi raj."
19336,Leonard,got it.
20873,Leonard,is that a retinal scanner?
20698,Leonard,hey.
19844,Leonard,"yeah, you know what else it is?"
16170,Leonard,"terrific. great. what level is that?  okay, now you don’t remind me of my mom."
19120,Leonard,butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from arizona.
21363,Leonard,is that nice?
19353,Leonard,"and while you’re at it, i know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to."
12622,Leonard,"oh, come on. the only reason you’re the lead author is because we went alphabetically. "
19972,Leonard,right.
17539,Leonard,what’s your point?
17408,Leonard,"oh, all right."
20467,Leonard,i know. food fight. i’ll keep thinking.
19930,Leonard,we’re gonna set a date.
21578,Leonard,"here comes our new boss, be polite."
19951,Leonard,thanks.
13797,Leonard,how about the toaster oven?
20278,Leonard,otherwise we’d love to.
13771,Leonard,"oh, hey, dave. and penny, what a surprise."
18147,Leonard,i thought you grew up on a farm.
12487,Leonard,good night sheldon.
16375,Leonard,"hit the… hey, sweetie. yeah, i’m sorry. i’m gonna be working late. i, i, i miss you, too. okay, sure, i’ll call you when i get home. okay, bye-bye."
12415,Leonard,doctor what?
21766,Leonard,why not?
12654,Leonard,"okay, i’m going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together."
12102,Leonard,that’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.
14944,Leonard,"what’s your point? in order to keep having a sexual relationship with penny, i have to give up everything i believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who i am? i can’t do that, howard."
15818,Leonard,like what?
16665,Leonard,amy?
15053,Leonard,oh. i used to be like that. then i got a girlfriend.
20346,Leonard,what do you think about giving sheldon’s ticket to stuart?
21406,Leonard,"oh, that was just because my mother got in my head. it’s like being possessed, but instead of satan it’s, actually, it’s the same thing."
13043,Leonard,"bye missy, see you."
21469,Leonard,hey.
18341,Leonard,"oh, come on. not that book. it, it’s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it."
14063,Leonard,that’s not fair. you’re not even a physicist.
21230,Leonard,hey.
13695,Leonard,"yeah. it’s wonderful. okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great."
12109,Leonard,we’re not going to give up just like that.
16753,Leonard,yes.
17463,Leonard,"uh, follow-up. are we still dating?"
14553,Leonard,they’re gonna get beaten up at that club.
16033,Leonard,"um, i guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there."
14378,Leonard,everybody?
18958,Leonard,"yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. you okay? i know he meant a lot to you."
16317,Leonard,no.
21748,Leonard,"if people don’t go in there, and you’re people, and… you are people, aren’t you? making a joke."
18565,Leonard,"okay, barry, that’s enough."
20111,Leonard,"well, let’s start small. we can always add more."
16111,Leonard,"of course, sometimes the federation and the romulans would enter the neutral zone to negotiate a temporary truce."
17157,Leonard,"me, too, i missed you."
20393,Leonard,you’re not dying. it’s just the flu.
18464,Leonard,"wow, you ask really hard questions."
15327,Leonard,"it’s ten o’clock, where have you been?"
21301,Leonard,"oh, boo-hoo. i spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. what is that?"
21362,Leonard,now we’re going as hulk and she-hulk. i don’t want to take my shirt off at comic-con.
17603,Leonard,"57, 58, 59, that’s one minute."
13519,Leonard,"yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?"
14780,Leonard,what’s so funny?
16236,Leonard,how come it’s not a party when we do it here?
19189,Leonard,"wow, raj, you were not lying about her."
20533,Leonard,"again, no…"
16452,Leonard,"we were in here first, you can’t be in here."
17316,Leonard,"no, he doesn’t."
14783,Leonard,"people could call me angie. yo, angie, how’s it goin’?"
17602,Leonard,"because he’s hard to find. if he was easy to find, the books would be called there’s waldo."
15565,Leonard,"you cannot exist as a virtual presence. not here and certainly not at work. oh, good god."
18606,Leonard,"we talked about it, but howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom."
18972,Leonard,"mm. well, i think more about if i’d have any regrets."
12811,Leonard,then just say go straight. 
14555,Leonard,"okay, i know what you’re doing."
19855,Leonard,"i’m just saying, sometimes raj and i feel pushed aside."
15066,Leonard,"i’m sorry, sheldon."
19169,Leonard,sorry.
14514,Leonard,so much.
18950,Leonard,"uh, well, it’s not may the fifth, and it’s not may the third. it’s may the fourth."
13539,Leonard,your mother.
12935,Leonard,"sorry, i panicked. "
12073,Leonard,no.
13588,Leonard,"so, uh, what we did was in fact dating?"
16534,Leonard,"no, she wouldn’t."
17995,Leonard,"oh, i’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner."
14854,Leonard,we’re shocked.
18306,Leonard,"i just said, couples sound great."
16142,Leonard,have you seen him?
17941,Leonard,we don’t ask sheldon things like that.
15967,Leonard,what?
16057,Leonard,it’s not a joke. it’s the real design.
18253,Leonard,"sheldon, i got to go inside. it’s getting rough out here."
21243,Leonard,"ignore him. yeah, sorry about the breakup."
12026,Leonard,"we don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall."
18545,Leonard,"yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long."
17522,Leonard,"it’ll be fine. just, uh, pretend he’s wolowitz."
15621,Leonard,hey.
12183,Leonard,"yes! for god’s sake, sheldon, do i have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time i open my mouth."
19210,Leonard,yeah.
15253,Leonard,how can you not be sure?
13707,Leonard,it’s just a little scary.
13954,Leonard,yeah. hang on. sheldon!
12810,Leonard,what? 
18741,Leonard,hold on. we always do this. 
13402,Leonard,"sheldon, i told you, i only have access to the free-electron laser at night. i can’t drive you for the next few weeks."
15525,Leonard,how’s that?
19622,Leonard,and how could a chimp even solve that? that was impossible.
16903,Leonard,the bird’s still there?
20961,Leonard,"oh, true, but think of how much you’ve accomplished. who got him to stop purelling his pocket change?"
12830,Leonard,advantage kim. 
13124,Leonard,"wait, did you say wait?"
15842,Leonard,was it out of respect that you didn’t tell raj about the time you dropped his iphone in a urinal?
18024,Leonard,"yes. it’s all on you. but i got to tell you, when the time comes, i want the whole nine yards. i want you down on one knee, flowers, i want to be swept off my feet."
14243,Leonard,"hey, howard?"
18463,Leonard,"oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends."
19028,Leonard,"okay. well, now that everyone’s here, penny and i have some big news. we’re engaged."
13577,Leonard,"well, i wrote some of it down."
12711,Leonard,how?
16936,Leonard,"um, let’s see. hiking. karaoke in koreatown. any jennifer aniston movie."
17130,Leonard,yes.
21554,Leonard,hello.
21313,Leonard,aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?
13472,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not going to learn morse code at three o’clock in the morning!"
19624,Leonard,"hey, you okay?"
17970,Leonard,great. i’ll go get my stuff.
19915,Leonard,thank you.
12701,Leonard,"sheldon, what is it? "
19468,Leonard,yeah.
14162,Leonard,amazon offers one-day rush.
21039,Leonard,"look, i get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours."
19252,Leonard,"so you’re, you’re saying we should stand here in my lab on a saturday night and watch the rest of ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?"
14857,Leonard,i don’t know. maybe because i’m crazy?
16201,Leonard,"oh, nothing’s going on. excuse me."
16264,Leonard,bam. right in the nose. made me proud to own a pc.
21513,Leonard,"yeah, but she also used to sleep with zack."
17379,Leonard,"yeah, he worships hawking."
18298,Leonard,"oh, these are a little different. there’s a tradition at elite universities…"
13091,Leonard,"here you go, copenhagen boy, how about a taste of hans christian hand grenade.  come on, come on, oh you clever little…. come on, come on, take that! "
15389,Leonard,"sure. black, right?"
20697,Leonard,that’s true.
15141,Leonard,"oh, hey, buddy. how’d it go?"
17547,Leonard,mm-hmm.
14491,Leonard,"hey, guys."
16124,Leonard,"oh, i don’t know. maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed."
17796,Leonard,"fine. howard, what do you do?"
15370,Leonard,hmm? yeah? what? huh?
19664,Leonard,in sunglasses and a hat after i parked two blocks away.
15223,Leonard,"oh, right. ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, dr. sheldon cooper."
19973,Leonard,"it wasn’t even very good. she was a smoker, i’d just been seasick."
17065,Leonard,i don’t know what to tell you. buy her something.
17191,Leonard,"oh, no, come on!"
20342,Leonard,i think penny has a point. you can see it another day.
16719,Leonard,just bilbo baggins’ sword over there.
15003,Leonard,i think penny likes to skate. the four of us could double.
13696,Leonard,are you sure? that doesn’t sound right.
12079,Leonard,well i’m not trying to have sex with her.
12845,Leonard,hey.
19070,Leonard,he’s at the train station.
19454,Leonard,do you want the fire extinguisher?
20233,Leonard,i’m the one who thought of spockumentary.
18033,Leonard,"raj, what’s going on?"
13410,Leonard,"because rock breaks scissors, goodnight."
18322,Leonard,what does she think i am?
15995,Leonard,that’s an atom.
14541,Leonard,"sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with penny."
17684,Leonard,wow.
15258,Leonard,really? i wouldn’t know what that’s like.
13101,Leonard,yes he is.
18883,Leonard,"so, are you gonna see her again?"
16060,Leonard,we’re not doing names now. howard?
20005,Leonard,yes.
16871,Leonard,forget about the bobcat.
21367,Leonard,i don’t have a problem with your driving.
20412,Leonard,you’re still not coming.
13791,Leonard,"very good, thanks for asking. come on in."
18292,Leonard,"um, since when can koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?"
14183,Leonard,"i’m sorry, that really is how it works."
20724,Leonard,"yeah, mm-hmm."
15903,Leonard,"it’s fine, it’s fine. go back to sleep."
19318,Leonard,"so, uh, what’s the deal? you take off your ring when you go to work?"
15732,Leonard,"well, i’m off to meet bernadette’s friend. how do i look?"
12790,Leonard,"howard, listen to me."
15576,Leonard,"i was wrong, this is exactly like knight rider."
15831,Leonard,"uh, i was out."
15666,Leonard,"i don’t know. sometimes your movements are so lifelike, i forget you’re not a real boy."
20811,Leonard,"uh, i would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be."
13999,Leonard,nothing. mother likes looking at brains and sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
18031,Leonard,whoa.
12394,Leonard,"thank you, i’ll see you at work. "
19501,Leonard,you have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. it’s exhausting.
12469,Leonard,maybe they just want to be friends. 
14368,Leonard,"i’m sorry, were you talking to me?"
17387,Leonard,you do realize you own his ass right now.
21519,Leonard,"well, thanks. and i don’t want you to be stuck at a job you don’t like."
13566,Leonard,"yeah, i really didn’t think this through."
15974,Leonard,"oh, how’d it go last night?"
21608,Leonard,hey penny.
12169,Leonard,sheldon? hello? 
13039,Leonard,"oh. huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall… and perfect. "
20817,Leonard,i don’t like it either.
16132,Leonard,read this woman’s tweet.
16146,Leonard,"oh, dr. siebert, twelve o’clock."
16490,Leonard,yeah. how did you know?
16758,Leonard,can we get autographed dolls?
13613,Leonard,"oh, my god, what did you do?"
15634,Leonard,"okay, we need to talk."
16424,Leonard,i can’t say.
20261,Leonard,i don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.
19246,Leonard,"we didn’t have to, that was clearly a tangent. now come on. back to work. if we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… aah! why?"
13398,Leonard,take the bus.
13104,Leonard,"there is a party, isn’t there."
20828,Leonard,"yeah, special, like that.  that’s them. please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are."
13309,Leonard,"no, that’s marcie. peppermint patty’s just athletic."
13634,Leonard,"oh, for god’s sakes."
18419,Leonard,"oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. look at me with you. "
12312,Leonard,"when i take a girl out on a date, and i do, she knows she’s been dated. capital d. bold face, underline, like day-ted. i think i might have a little concussion, i’m going to go lay down for a while, good night. "
17596,Leonard,just pick another game.
17516,Leonard,okay.
16904,Leonard,i don’t know. scree-scree.
12495,Leonard,penny?
17582,Leonard,"i don’t have a problem with stuart. besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store."
12909,Leonard,"okay, let me try it this way, you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more. "
16506,Leonard,"uh, that’s my water."
21300,Leonard,"sir, uh, if i may, uh, we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. it’s a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works."
19168,Leonard,come on. it’ll be fun.
21624,Leonard,thanks.
19444,Leonard,i told you my plan. let’s call building services and get help.
18745,Leonard,"howard, you in on this?"
13068,Leonard,excuse me while i go tell missy the good news. 
20147,Leonard,that’s not why we’re here.
14292,Leonard,we’re not going to get wolowitz a hooker.
17251,Leonard,fine.
18564,Leonard,it’s not a big deal.
14055,Leonard,what do you mean?
16220,Leonard,i know. last time i came on too strong. can we talk in private?
12202,Leonard,"no, please, we insist, it’s the least we can do considering. "
17218,Leonard,"it’s just a blackout, i’m sure the power will be back on soon."
16834,Leonard,go ask penny; she’ll know what to do.
20386,Leonard,you know what’d be nice? name it after your girlfriends. show them how much you care.
15783,Leonard,"you’re right, you’re lost, good luck."
21595,Leonard,my turn on the time machine. 
19314,Leonard,can we please change the subject?
15875,Leonard,i’m sorry. why can’t you sleep?
19552,Leonard,which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. so what do you think? what do you think? so what do you think?
14868,Leonard,"yeah, you got me. i’m a leibniz man."
14374,Leonard,why?
20754,Leonard,"i don’t know what he’s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever."
12560,Leonard,"no, i’m pretty sure my anger’s with you."
18335,Leonard,"this one is, too."
14061,Leonard,"no, it’s leslie winkle. it’s a long story."
14330,Leonard,"no! there, it went to voice mail."
20642,Leonard,"well, that is the grown-up thing."
20242,Leonard,you bought her a ring?
21239,Leonard,"article 10, subsection c, if questioned penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. other unacceptable responses include, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it, and, i said it’s nothing don’t worry about it. "
20421,Leonard,"what do we do, kick them off?"
13031,Leonard,"so missy, what brings you all the way from texas? "
19221,Leonard,hey.
19415,Leonard,"uh, i’ve been looking for a professor sharpe?"
19067,Leonard,"oh, i know his password, so i can track his phone."
16563,Leonard,"there’s a reciprocity clause. you get to pull the plug on him, too."
20824,Leonard,"well, why? what’s wrong?"
16829,Leonard,"the problem is, i want to be one of those guys."
14187,Leonard,hello.
21198,Leonard,why?
17229,Leonard,i thought you said candles were dangerous.
19742,Leonard,"if we do, we’ll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?"
12012,Leonard,i’m sure she’ll still love him.
14084,Leonard,"okay, then we won’t touch the hard drive. we’ll just erase the first season of battlestar."
13418,Leonard,watch out.
20373,Leonard,"oh, no, i, i’ve worked through a lot of that stuff, i’m better now."
13408,Leonard,"sheldon, you need to learn how to drive."
13211,Leonard,no.
13100,Leonard,"excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts."
21618,Leonard,what?
15935,Leonard,what kind of guys did you used to go out with?
21138,Leonard,no. 
15216,Leonard,"but it could be part of your problem. let me give you an example. when i was eight, i won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “do lima beans grow better to classical music.” but my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “do lima beans grow worse to rock ‘n’ roll.” i felt so guilty, i gave the ribbon back."
21549,Leonard,"well, the last three nights i’ve had to take him to get a haircut, to the train store, and to a walgreens in arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen. now ask me how i’m doing with amy gone."
17355,Leonard,prove it.
17014,Leonard,what’s the idea?
19688,Leonard,did they hate it?
15540,Leonard,how can you walk around with no money?
18276,Leonard,good morning.
20532,Leonard,"again, no offence, but so have i."
13629,Leonard,want some more wine?
14652,Leonard,why wouldn’t penny want her friends to meet me?
19674,Leonard,"damn straight, almost 1am. and we weren’t even watching tv. we were watching netflix, like the kids do."
19111,Leonard,how were they?
19319,Leonard,why?
20955,Leonard,don’t beat yourself up. you’ve never lived with anyone before.
12781,Leonard,no kidding?
20252,Leonard,he didn’t meant that.
21385,Leonard,"hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?"
13983,Leonard,"i hate to tell you, but the only warm memories i have of my childhood are of my uncle floyd."
19373,Leonard,"because i can’t breathe. i snore, i get sinus infections."
17615,Leonard,nope. now the lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.
14443,Leonard,i’m going to go let penny know we’re back.
14897,Leonard,what is it?
18993,Leonard,at least they toned him down in the second one.
21178,Leonard,you know how easily i blister.
21248,Leonard,i was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.
12266,Leonard,i’ll get my chisel.
15654,Leonard,when was the last time you saw her?
19774,Leonard,"well, the g stands for graphics. that’s a hard g, so i’d say gif."
15971,Leonard,"oh, the reverse psychology thing. i see. that’s very clever."
15924,Leonard,no.
17546,Leonard,just say it.
17828,Leonard,i can’t blame you. tiny twister was a complete bust.
14628,Leonard,"okay, fine, like a pinky swear."
14438,Leonard,reconstituted thai food.
20915,Leonard,"and we live with sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning."
14321,Leonard,"no, no that’s the past. i’m really more of a right now kind of guy. you know, living in the moment. although i do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. in conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me."
14044,Leonard,"well, we’re not gonna tell him i did it."
19151,Leonard,nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.
17482,Leonard,hmm.
16962,Leonard,"yeah, that’s not it. stuart’s kind of interested in amy."
12293,Leonard,"well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”"
14308,Leonard,"oh, too bad. i guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on."
17069,Leonard,what are you gonna do?
19694,Leonard,"uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. i mean, that’s what’s important."
15692,Leonard,"fine. if i don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home."
14079,Leonard,"okay. now, we all run out. sheldon and i will cut to the left behind these trees. raj, howard and leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. then we’ll all have a great view as penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight."
19993,Leonard,"hey, if you’re hungry, there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door."
16411,Leonard,"mm, it’s complicated, but as i remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home."
14401,Leonard,yeah.
19326,Leonard,"oh, my god."
21606,Leonard,what does that mean?
16104,Leonard,what?
13565,Leonard,"i can’t tell you that, either."
13303,Leonard,"great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?"
17537,Leonard,you can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
21069,Leonard,"ignore him, he’s just cranky because bert from the geology lab won a big grant."
18460,Leonard,"oh, god."
19446,Leonard,"because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up."
17718,Leonard,"come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you."
13559,Leonard,"got it. so, can i see you again?"
13315,Leonard,"yeah, i see that. shouldn’t you be at work?"
18644,Leonard,"look, do i think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? of course i do. but isn’t los angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? all right, look, we’ll come back to that."
17243,Leonard,"doesn’t look happy, so i’m guessing he wants to talk to sheldon."
19889,Leonard,"no need to. as soon as she flies into california airspace, i’ll feel a disturbance in the force."
16359,Leonard,we got him. we’re almost done.
16188,Leonard,"i’m very hungry. for food, right?"
16415,Leonard,what? you’re kidding!
19888,Leonard,"i don’t know, some time tomorrow morning."
20358,Leonard,that’s true.
13533,Leonard,"no. look, this has to stop."
13460,Leonard,touche.
17744,Leonard,really?
19041,Leonard,what you working on?
15969,Leonard,i’ll give it a shot.
14879,Leonard,"wait, wait, wait. when did you send my mom notes on a paper?"
16418,Leonard,hey!
19615,Leonard,sorry again.
16765,Leonard,"all right, that settles it, we’re going out. do you like sushi? there’s a great little place down the street."
12985,Leonard,what if i knocked you unconscious right now? 
21428,Leonard,"i mean, i’m glad they’re getting along, but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable."
13507,Leonard,sheldon’s onion ring. just put it back!
21319,Leonard,you can do this.
14246,Leonard,why?
16381,Leonard,no.
14508,Leonard,please don’t be mad.
20695,Leonard,i don’t think so. why?
12413,Leonard,oh. okay. thank you.
13549,Leonard,what?
18859,Leonard,"well, you don’t go into science for the money."
19676,Leonard,"right there, right there, oh, god, that’s it."
12535,Leonard,"i know, i know, look, you have a tv in your room, why don’t you just have breakfast in bed? "
18426,Leonard,"actually, it can be, but i told you sex doesn’t count."
14351,Leonard,great. so how’d it go with stuart last night?
20523,Leonard,are you crazy? how can you put michael keaton in front of christian bale?
20186,Leonard,do you want liquid helium or not?
19368,Leonard,"my god, who’s the dork now? thank you for wearing your flats."
13862,Leonard,"no! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. meet people. talk to them. take an interest in their lives."
13196,Leonard,"i’m not there because i’m taking things slow. which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. and take down that camera. "
12733,Leonard,well… i don’t know what to say. 
17787,Leonard,"aw, i got a little paper cut."
18880,Leonard,"you know what, why don’t you just do it? you’ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?"
14810,Leonard,raj.
17510,Leonard,"well, it’s not really a great time. penny and i have some things we need to talk about."
16048,Leonard,satisfied?
12321,Leonard,"well then we’ll avoid finkleday, we’ll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go. "
13277,Leonard,it changed.
12594,Leonard,"wait a minute, what’s the plan here? let’s say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what’s he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?"
15759,Leonard,and your poll numbers just keep dropping.
20865,Leonard,i don’t know how i feel about this.
13917,Leonard,your ex-boyfriend?
19885,Leonard,they’re graduating.
17774,Leonard,"why would it trouble you? it’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song."
13538,Leonard,"okay, for the record what you’re doing is really creepy."
21291,Leonard,"hey, uh, buddy, i got you a little present."
17232,Leonard,you say thank you.
20081,Leonard,"well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?"
12134,Leonard,"they’re not going anywhere.  so, you’re coming home from work. that’s great. how was work."
14713,Leonard,"there you go, she has to pick up her friend justin at the airport, aand i can’t play ’cause i’m going with her, right?"
18986,Leonard,"ooh, interesting. did you just propose to me again?"
17393,Leonard,give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
12091,Leonard,"come on, i’ll show you the trick with the shower."
15675,Leonard,what are you doing in there?
17763,Leonard,"well, he’s not wrong. howard did go to the international space station."
14533,Leonard,"it would, wouldn’t it?"
13705,Leonard,i don’t know what that means.
19614,Leonard,thank you.
20426,Leonard,"oh, it’ll be nice to finally meet her."
16240,Leonard,i really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.
21695,Leonard,push it real good.
17458,Leonard,pretty much.
18559,Leonard,"okay, sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? if i don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does."
17576,Leonard,"mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn’t talk to her. she had to bring him a grover puppet so he could point at what hurt."
20989,Leonard,"but i-i-i, oh. nothing about that was good."
12456,Leonard,go on.
17807,Leonard,walls are getting closer.
19670,Leonard,"okay, but it’s a drive, the one i went to is in san diego."
17048,Leonard,"okay, jimmy, it’s time for you to go."
18218,Leonard,interesting that you would bring that up when i might go work on a boat.
19573,Leonard,"sheldon, this is superfluid helium. put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off."
13819,Leonard,"seriously? gamma rays? bruce banner? you didn’t get the incredible hulk from that? never mind, just, please go talk to him."
16864,Leonard,"no, it’s not gonna do it."
20429,Leonard,same as when we lost you at the zoo.
12709,Leonard,yes.
18736,Leonard,does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?
19414,Leonard,"i think if you’re pulling up your pants, you’re not a doorman. "
15873,Leonard,what are you doing up?
20699,Leonard,let’s get out of here.
18287,Leonard,bye.
17022,Leonard,it wasn’t fun for me.
14360,Leonard,you’re kidding. never worked for me.
18541,Leonard,why won’t you sign it?
12453,Leonard,where do you get this stuff?
15933,Leonard,"what, uh, the kissing and everything? nah, women do that to me all the time."
12261,Leonard,us guys?
15647,Leonard,surprise.
20241,Leonard,will wil want it?
18940,Leonard,you and i never just hang out like this. why is that?
21120,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m warning you, i can play this game, too."
17444,Leonard,"okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. why don’t we just start doing that now?"
20562,Leonard,you guys all right?
19508,Leonard,everything’s fine. we just started talking about living arrangements.
15822,Leonard,what alibi?
13981,Leonard,"oh, my god. what happened?"
14911,Leonard,"once again, i’m driving. i’m right here."
19457,Leonard,"relax, it wasn’t your fault."
17280,Leonard,"no. no, i’m not."
20069,Leonard,because i didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.
21203,Leonard,because we just spent our allowance on comic books.
20923,Leonard,i’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this. 
21472,Leonard,"so, rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?"
20411,Leonard,"appreciate that, too."
20130,Leonard,"hey, we brought you thai. where is everything?"
15443,Leonard,she didn’t dump me. we were just in different places in the relationship.
17650,Leonard,am i allowed to ask how the class is going?
13363,Leonard,hey.
19211,Leonard,we had that idea years ago. how come we never did anything with it?
16205,Leonard,"uh, i’m gonna go lie down."
13653,Leonard,"really? oh, look at that, i have a girlfriend."
20240,Leonard,you have a will?
18533,Leonard,how am i the bad guy? she’s the one who married someone else. i’m the victim.
18666,Leonard,to my room.
18040,Leonard,i’m sorry. that i asked.
12642,Leonard,"oh, careful. that’s my original series battlestar galactica flight suit. "
14369,Leonard,"yes, you did, didn’t you?"
21210,Leonard,what? where is this coming from?
17771,Leonard,what are you idiots doing?
12918,Leonard,yes. 
18593,Leonard,"hi, uh, um, i’m leonard?"
13254,Leonard,how?
20820,Leonard,go to sleep.
12175,Leonard,what?
13094,Leonard,"well if i had a gun there, would you have shot yourself? "
15295,Leonard,"hey, where you been?"
18093,Leonard,"so, which one do you think it is, matey?"
17180,Leonard,"all right, fair enough. i certainly can be quieter when we kiss. i thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? uh, uh, i’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? nah, never mind, it’s right here."
19643,Leonard,ladies?
15694,Leonard,"you realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t."
16955,Leonard,i am such an asthmatic dumbass. i had a weird night.
18200,Leonard,"hey, i always did sound effects. a-a swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. "
19767,Leonard,"the glass is empty, sheldon. it’s completely empty. if you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?"
12198,Leonard,"um, here’s the thing.  penny. just as oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too i regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. the hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. some mistakes, such as madame curie’s discovery of radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. another example, from the field of ebola research…."
15271,Leonard,"fine. just tell me what to do, and i’ll do it."
16894,Leonard,not on blu-ray. only twice on blu-ray.
15856,Leonard,why not?
13274,Leonard,"i know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy i would be more than happy to get out of your way."
18638,Leonard,"nope. uh, uh, i might not know what i meant, but i know that i didn’t mean that. not this guy. oh, no way."
15077,Leonard,"oh, for god’s sakes."
17573,Leonard,thank you.
14749,Leonard,sure.
15639,Leonard,"okay, i got it, i got it, she’s not your girlfriend. now listen to me. i know about loneliness. i know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. when i broke up with penny, i got back into my cello, i built a bunch of model rockets, i got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell."
18498,Leonard,"well, sheldon, it took me all morning, but i found the owner of the video store. and i am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. anyway, there is no one to return the dvd to, so this issue is resolved. ah! and i’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, i didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me."
18523,Leonard,"yeah, they are."
15027,Leonard,"if you don’t come out of there, i’m going to have to drag you out."
17473,Leonard,i don’t want to talk about it.
13713,Leonard,"oh, okay. i just hope i don’t get cramps."
14283,Leonard,"okay, uh, if i get lucky i’ll take her to my stately manor outside gotham city, and if you get lucky, i’ll sleep on the moon."
14973,Leonard,but you don’t like other people.
19589,Leonard,me-wow.
20371,Leonard,"really? any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?"
14232,Leonard,i don’t believe it. stuart’s putting the moves on penny.
13407,Leonard,"so we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it."
14149,Leonard,are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
16975,Leonard,hocus pocus pocahontas.
13752,Leonard,"no, we play rock band on our x-box."
14213,Leonard,"yes, but we all agreed that the third thursday of every month would be anything can happen thursday."
18111,Leonard,not that you need it. i bet you look great in a swimsuit.
18652,Leonard,"so? even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. wolowitz sent his in two days ago."
15064,Leonard,penny.
12343,Leonard,because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes. 
17143,Leonard,well…
21302,Leonard,"okay, look, sheldon, the colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can’t do it without you."
19269,Leonard,"the car was a gift, it was something you needed. i was happy to help you out."
14047,Leonard,"mm, butt print. there’s no discernible butt print."
19282,Leonard,hmm. maybe. or maybe i tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.
15401,Leonard,so you’re not judging me?
15074,Leonard,"well, you’ll ski, i’ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in switzerland for valentine’s day."
17984,Leonard,you’re a hero.
12196,Leonard,what did she say? is she still mad at me?
15841,Leonard,really?
16621,Leonard,"you know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. they’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you."
13657,Leonard,"okay, i’ll be right in."
15882,Leonard,hey.
20529,Leonard,batman finally came to your party.
13666,Leonard,"no, absolutely not."
18296,Leonard,aw.
15562,Leonard,i can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
13453,Leonard,"hey, do you want to hang out with us?"
16082,Leonard,sheldon! we’re working here!
19630,Leonard,"if you want, i can yell at you later."
15355,Leonard,yes?
15569,Leonard,"no, it’s not."
16478,Leonard,"okay, now i have to ask. what do they do?"
17222,Leonard,since when don’t you knock? it’s like the only good thing about you.
15780,Leonard,"no, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work."
13390,Leonard,"yeah, let’s see, money, women, technology, okay we’re agreed, our new friend is going to be iron man."
13971,Leonard,yes.
19530,Leonard,"ooh, emily. i heard him say that to emily. hey, i thought you were staying home."
19357,Leonard,"oh, it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. try not to touch it when you’re dancing."
12980,Leonard,sorry.
14473,Leonard,maybe you can.
15178,Leonard,"you know what? i am ending this. penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. she gave it to me, i have it. i’m sending it back. where’s the ring?"
20313,Leonard,you were just humming.
21058,Leonard,that’s true. sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus.
14309,Leonard,why the hell not?
12094,Leonard,"you’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, i’ll…."
19439,Leonard,"okay, how do we catch it?"
21620,Leonard,"i’m really very busy. is there any way that we can put this off until i have more time to prepare? of course. but, uh, you understand my trepidation."
19203,Leonard,that’s true.
15602,Leonard,"so, this is nice. first time we’ve all gotten together to eat."
13432,Leonard,hey.
12912,Leonard,"he won’t say. he just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar. "
20097,Leonard,"fun, i’ve never been there."
18651,Leonard,"there’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it."
19493,Leonard,"i, i’m sorry? you make compromises for me?"
16757,Leonard,what are you doing here?
12891,Leonard,"i move we are the army ants, all those in favour?"
21687,Leonard,you mean this weirdly suspicious one?
13304,Leonard,i only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it’s starting to attract wildlife.
19175,Leonard,"okay, well, this might make you feel better. uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. also, we both think i’m not funny. huh? see, you’re not laughing."
16544,Leonard,"so, no, on the shepherd’s pie. can we move on?"
16090,Leonard,"okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up."
19050,Leonard,"look, i, i know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary."
17790,Leonard,"little bit, yeah."
16095,Leonard,pretty much. except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
13256,Leonard,"uh, sure."
20301,Leonard,"you know me, i’m a big ol’ bookworm."
17063,Leonard,that’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.
20448,Leonard,i know.
13892,Leonard,"he’s not lying, he does find that fascinating."
20309,Leonard,"don’t want people to see what, huh? a little bit of this?"
21329,Leonard,but all you did was complain when he did that.
18163,Leonard,nice shot.
20906,Leonard,"it’s okay, we’ll figure something out."
14376,Leonard,"yeah, i know the feeling."
18660,Leonard,what?
18595,Leonard,"eh, uh, well, i was wondering, if you’re not too busy, um, uh, if, if you’d be interested in telling me where the restroom is?"
20896,Leonard,i’m gonna get some coffee. you want some?
18716,Leonard,"my point is, just because i couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. and i’m proud of you. "
20833,Leonard,are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?
13106,Leonard,how could i be mad? you actually risked your life because you cared about me.
15706,Leonard,no.
18478,Leonard,"why? because i got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? no, i was her favorite."
19828,Leonard,or we could be omegas. they get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.
13537,Leonard,it’ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
20848,Leonard,"you realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us."
16745,Leonard,"wait, let me see if i got this right. you actually asked bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?"
20924,Leonard,"never leave a belt on the floor. at night, they look like snakes."
15150,Leonard,"anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff."
17327,Leonard,"good point, i’m in."
21139,Leonard,"well, i’d like that, too. "
20232,Leonard,why is he writing to you?
12963,Leonard,i just assumed. who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
18982,Leonard,"yeah, i think i would."
12703,Leonard,that would have hurt her feelings. 
21044,Leonard,what about my robot poster?
20383,Leonard,"wow, that’s amazing. i’m in a pretty great mood today myself."
12235,Leonard,"look, howard, if i were to ask lesley winkle out it would just be for dinner, i’m not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me."
21065,Leonard,wow.
12080,Leonard,"what makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, i’m a male and she’s a female?"
18669,Leonard,no.
18336,Leonard,wasn’t the answer sheldon’s spot?
18280,Leonard,"no, i don’t."
13606,Leonard,i’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
19076,Leonard,"okay, i know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. come on, let’s get you home."
13993,Leonard,"there’s no hurry, mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other."
21117,Leonard,"well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now i’ve got you, so it’s either sheldon or gargamel from the smurfs."
13580,Leonard,i’ve had her brisket. melts in your mouth.
20343,Leonard,i know. it’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.
12025,Leonard,hi.
18222,Leonard,"oh, that’s awful."
17265,Leonard,"hey, howard, i need to tell you something."
14143,Leonard,hello?
18455,Leonard,"i’m sorry, dr. jeffries, i’m just excited. this nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting."
16439,Leonard,no. that’s not what he meant.
21448,Leonard,it’s getting harder to pretend.
21343,Leonard,maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.
14239,Leonard,i don’t need any insights. i just want to know why penny’s more interested in stuart than me. we’re practically the same guy.
13237,Leonard,you’re nitpicking.
13147,Leonard,"yeah, i know, i know that part. "
20690,Leonard,"you’re, you’re right, it feels good."
18967,Leonard,i am not a crybaby.
12551,Leonard,we don’t order egg rolls.
15820,Leonard,"kind of busy here, sheldon."
13236,Leonard,"please let it go, sheldon."
16331,Leonard,"oh, okay, it’s not important. it can wait."
17080,Leonard,what are you talking about?
20268,Leonard,can i see?
14287,Leonard,"okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party."
16746,Leonard,"i hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you."
16622,Leonard,you video-chat with amy all the time. how is this different?
21669,Leonard,don’t let this be sheldon playing bongos. please don’t let this be sheldon playing bongos.
21101,Leonard,"sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash."
20681,Leonard,"anyway, amy, thank you for sticking up for me."
14803,Leonard,you’d have a better shot with the three-breasted martian hooker from total recall.
21656,Leonard,or it could be sy-fee.
15204,Leonard,"sit down, we want to talk to you."
12515,Leonard,good night.
15032,Leonard,really? you figured out the graphene problem?
20782,Leonard,"wait, we’re gonna get married again?"
17734,Leonard,"i, well, i see her around. i like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude."
15043,Leonard,"lettuce shredded, not chopped?"
15248,Leonard,chilli cheese fry?
12512,Leonard,"well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner. "
20288,Leonard,you don’t know your own husband’s birthday.
12057,Leonard,"yes, i remember."
13576,Leonard,"oh, you know, i’m a physicist, so, i thought about stuff."
16628,Leonard,yep.
12056,Leonard,"yes i now, but…"
17066,Leonard,"well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture."
21369,Leonard,i honestly don’t.
15078,Leonard,"yeah. we also put in what happens if one of us wins a macarthur grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie."
17756,Leonard,your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. you’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
16706,Leonard,do you really want that?
19874,Leonard,"hey, where’d you go?"
13244,Leonard,borrowed?
12138,Leonard,"yeah, no problem."
16354,Leonard,"i’m on it.  hi, mrs. wolowitz. is, is howard there? okay, thanks. that particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath."
13874,Leonard,how was rock climbing?
20303,Leonard,"okay. well, then i’ll read it to you. it’s from the day we first met. beauty, thy name is penny."
21693,Leonard,"you want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
16877,Leonard,moo-shu is penny.
20608,Leonard,anything you’d like to say to him?
21072,Leonard,what are you doing?
20984,Leonard,"okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour. "
19220,Leonard,they seem okay with it.
20410,Leonard,thank you. i appreciate that.
18684,Leonard,"look, if you want to break up, just say it."
20594,Leonard,he’ll never make it in time.
12346,Leonard,where are you going?
13883,Leonard,"why? they’re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound."
13550,Leonard,how can 5 not be worse than 1?
17847,Leonard,mm. i found this quiz online called which star trek character are you? and it only took me four tries to get captain kirk.
18949,Leonard,something terrible in a former life? i don’t know.
15219,Leonard,"damn right, i’m angry with my mother. for god’s sake, i was eight years old. she humiliated me. that’s when the bed-wetting started again."
12468,Leonard,"why should we leave? for all we know, he crashed the party and penny doesn’t even want him here. ."
16865,Leonard,"leonard’s coming down the home stretch! come on, horsey, you can do this! damn. come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! yes! first place. i would have been a great jockey if i weren’t too tall. and scared of horses. sheldon, you’re up."
21392,Leonard,just when i thought you couldn’t get any hotter.
14211,Leonard,"i had to, she called me cutie."
18609,Leonard,"why can’t you be fat, too?"
21698,Leonard,"come on, we’re going to the hospital."
18569,Leonard,well…
16326,Leonard,does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?
20940,Leonard,"if you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee."
20801,Leonard,"and, of course, mom."
14672,Leonard,"focus on the game, not the commercials, raj."
17230,Leonard,"listen, sheldon, this is stupid. i don’t see why we can’t be friends. and i’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. i just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement."
14000,Leonard,she’s only been here a day and a half and i’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
19155,Leonard,"okay, i got to, i, i, i, i got to ask. what makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?"
17745,Leonard,hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
19390,Leonard,"buddy, i, i get that you’re worried about me and i, i appreciate that, but i’m not going to die."
18909,Leonard,"it actually looks good, sheldon."
16767,Leonard,what’s the last thing you were ever happy about?
18443,Leonard,"oh, gas-x has a new ultra strength. i guess they really do read their mail."
16131,Leonard,sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. we’re reading the reviews.
14738,Leonard,just give us a minute.
15001,Leonard,intellectually about 30 hours. emotionally about 29 years.
20600,Leonard,why are you pretending to be outdoors? you hate it.
20454,Leonard,"oh, i took care of it."
20280,Leonard,i know. i feel so grown up.
16259,Leonard,"good-bye, sheldon."
20405,Leonard,not this time.
16301,Leonard,"uh, penny, there’s something i have to tell you."
16314,Leonard,"i am not opening that door, sheldon."
21175,Leonard,"oh cool, i’ll be like a pointy-eared paul bunyan."
14256,Leonard,"well, what happened? we’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called."
15753,Leonard,it’s relatively new. i just know that i’m not gonna spend time with someone i don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. i’m okay on my own.
19006,Leonard,and i got itchy and swollen just watching you.
15463,Leonard,coming!
16254,Leonard,of course. good night.
12585,Leonard,"look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl. "
14601,Leonard,good.
14900,Leonard,that’s a lousy conversation starter.
19464,Leonard,i don’t know. there’s still a bird in here. we are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
14990,Leonard,i’m lactose intolerant.
13439,Leonard,"oh, good god."
13738,Leonard,it’s david underhill. so what?
15486,Leonard,"oh, hi. hey. hi, leslie."
12031,Leonard,"oh, great."
18668,Leonard,what?
18247,Leonard,i’m covered.
15896,Leonard,hysterical!
12279,Leonard,why?
14649,Leonard,"no, no, i’m not, so, great. you’ve got plans doing something you like, i’ve got plans doing something i like, so it’s good."
14772,Leonard,too bad sheldon couldn’t come with us.
18048,Leonard,helping women? y
12720,Leonard,"okay, why would i go to a drug intervention for your cousing."
12216,Leonard,"forget the sword, sheldon, help raj."
19236,Leonard,guys.
14863,Leonard,"mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society."
19541,Leonard,"you lie down, he’ll be here in a minute."
13428,Leonard,"yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive. please learn how to drive!"
19942,Leonard,"okay. well, then it’s settled. small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies."
20344,Leonard,hey. we’re going to the comic book store. you want to come?
18183,Leonard,"mr. jeffries, i’m, i’m leonard. this is my girlfriend, penny."
20507,Leonard,probably ’cause you got to see your man up there rockin’ the mic.
18613,Leonard,he made you his screensaver.
15884,Leonard,i can’t believe you’ve never seen raiders of the lost ark.
13275,Leonard,"yeah, it’s from changs."
17907,Leonard,"uh, we’re going to the comic-con in bakersfield. they have a big costume contest. it’s cooler than it sounds."
21526,Leonard,"hey, a toast. thank you all for your support while we worked on our air force project. and please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers."
14134,Leonard,"excuse me.  okay, i’ll be honest with you. i’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. but then i finally realized you’re a human being; i’m a human being. i could just say to you…"
12753,Leonard,sounds good.
19632,Leonard,that doesn’t sound right. my research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.
16430,Leonard,marry you?
15291,Leonard,don’t worry. you’ll meet a girl someday.
14567,Leonard,yes.
13459,Leonard,"so, how’d it go with ramona last night?"
15079,Leonard,"sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?"
12178,Leonard,"oh, what the hell."
16917,Leonard,"does this sound familiar? i’d love to go shoe shopping with you. hiking? it’s great. it’s two a.m., of course i want to go to korea town and sing karaoke with your friends. who wouldn’t?"
13448,Leonard,"no, come on, now, we’re going out."
21053,Leonard,how’s that broccoli?
12808,Leonard,won’t my footsteps set it off? 
21002,Leonard,yeah. i said no.
13687,Leonard,at least i have an egg. what do you have?
19467,Leonard,she says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
15416,Leonard,"okay, how about this? let me tell you about the first time i brought a girl over. "
18368,Leonard,"or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the blu-ray extended version of the hobbit movie with commentary track. on account of how sad i am about my mom."
16710,Leonard,deaf women can’t be gold diggers?
13587,Leonard,i’m sorry?
20150,Leonard,when was your honour insulted?
15558,Leonard,"sheldon, are you gonna join us?"
16501,Leonard,"thanks, yeah."
21373,Leonard,"well, i just don’t think you’re gonna have a good time."
12905,Leonard,"howard, raj and i just had a team meeting. "
21576,Leonard,"hey, what’s going on."
16093,Leonard,it’s an annual science conference. we’ve all been invited to speak.
17455,Leonard,"you mean, like in bed or in the shower?"
18991,Leonard,"it was nice, you know. a lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. did you know that arthur’s son is a high school sci…?  hey, the guys are about to start jedi. you want to go watch?"
21074,Leonard,"hey, i’m trying to help you."
20905,Leonard,seriously?
13299,Leonard,what’s the bright side?
17895,Leonard,"what? hey, hey! come back here!"
16981,Leonard,that’s all of us. can i use the laptop?
16150,Leonard,thanks.
20515,Leonard,"and we live here, so we have no choice."
16896,Leonard,really? do we do that?
13233,Leonard,"well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college. "
14986,Leonard,it was us. we knocked over a lamp.
21007,Leonard,"so, she’s just been lying to him?"
15366,Leonard,okeydoke.
19563,Leonard,you wrote a paper on my idea?
13513,Leonard,"just so i know, would you be open to taking his class? you can do it online!"
20460,Leonard,"well, glad you’re feeling better."
17749,Leonard,really?
17950,Leonard,"you are unbelievable. i don’t know why i put up with you. you’re controlling, you’re irritating."
13938,Leonard,fine. just enjoy your little game. i’ll make this quest on my own.
17566,Leonard,"oh, sure. please join us."
19122,Leonard,"hippos are the deadliest creature. a half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass."
15188,Leonard,"last one holding the ring decides its fate. i know, it sounds silly."
18344,Leonard,"it was not a crisis. apparently, i favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided."
21043,Leonard,yeah? what are you keeping?
14996,Leonard,they call themselves bozites?
15055,Leonard,"okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. and let’s see, who’s left? oh, that’s right. my plans. isn’t anyone going to ask?"
16672,Leonard,not really. is that my yearbook?
17709,Leonard,"i’m sorry, what was that? i had a little stroke after oral."
16609,Leonard,"uh, yeah, sure."
13808,Leonard,"yes, we did, kripke."
15811,Leonard,"alright, and raj."
21419,Leonard,jerry?
16221,Leonard,the word is forbade.
17810,Leonard,"three, two."
20618,Leonard,i could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
20472,Leonard,that sounds fun. when’s it start?
16636,Leonard,how about when you put gps trackers in your garbage because you were convinced north korean spies were stealing your doodles? the chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. the strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. the time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.
19455,Leonard,great. here you go.
16683,Leonard,"that sounds like a late night, and i have work in the morning, so…"
18004,Leonard,you’re kidding.
14807,Leonard,"how ya doin’, buddy?"
20921,Leonard,that’s a good question. maybe just don’t come over.
18480,Leonard,"no, no, no, i, i looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets."
17425,Leonard,"i’m sorry, howard, but i got to tell you, i’m a little relieved you’re not going."
13443,Leonard,sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
13853,Leonard,"aw, you picked up on that huh?"
16946,Leonard,"oh, yeah? spell asthma."
21655,Leonard,"hello? oh, my god! is he okay?"
16244,Leonard,ugh!
13142,Leonard,can we please change the subject.
20812,Leonard,"penny, i’ve always known i loved you, but this last year has shown me that i also love being married to you. thank you for saying yes."
21527,Leonard,"first thing tomorrow morning, we’re back at it."
15979,Leonard,great.
21308,Leonard,just keep thinking. i got it.
15399,Leonard,"yeah, i wanted to explain."
16410,Leonard,"yeah! dodgers are baseball, right?"
17640,Leonard,"sorry, officer."
20038,Leonard,"okay, that is the stupidest thing i’ve ever heard."
17730,Leonard,now you’re just being ridiculous.
12247,Leonard,none?
17253,Leonard,"sheldon, everybody takes vacations."
21525,Leonard,thank you.
16797,Leonard,"uh, yeah, yeah, sure, i guess."
20076,Leonard,"okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?"
17702,Leonard,"actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre fridays."
14664,Leonard,i wouldn’t be bored. why would i be bored?
14581,Leonard,"so, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?"
13691,Leonard,"no, the pants that stephanie got me."
16062,Leonard,that’s just sheldon backwards.
14371,Leonard,what?
12307,Leonard,"yes, but i get car sick too, so…"
16873,Leonard, amy. bye.
19911,Leonard,"yes, you are a super weaner."
19681,Leonard,but it’s an expression of our love.
21734,Leonard,what is that?
17957,Leonard,yes.
20359,Leonard,"oh, if anything, i’m trying to get my sheld-off."
14135,Leonard,"hi, my name’s leonard."
17797,Leonard,and you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.
16109,Leonard,right. so we’ll just call the middle here the neutral zone.
18011,Leonard,you know what? why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our valentine’s day?
17201,Leonard,"oh, can’t you take the bus to the dentist?"
14289,Leonard,"oh, howard’s losing it. check out his latest twitters. “i’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. my life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”"
17782,Leonard,"yeah, come on, howard. hook that worm."
14714,Leonard,wait. what are you talking about?
12048,Leonard,"i have a board. if you like boards, this is my board."
20223,Leonard,he wants more money.
14955,Leonard,so what? it’s the same food.
17626,Leonard,what?
16912,Leonard,"actually, you know what? i think it’s about time i pick a movie we see."
15810,Leonard,"okay, fine, i betrayed howard."
20834,Leonard,this is ridiculous. i’m going across the hall.
17681,Leonard,"oh, come on, you know that’s not true."
20651,Leonard,"seriously, that guy’s dating two women?"
14801,Leonard,"you know, when sheldon gives you homework, you don’t have to do it."
18829,Leonard,"no, no, no. this is not a fight. i was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. now it’s a fight."
13317,Leonard,"okay, um, here’s the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted."
17634,Leonard,"yeah. oh, uh, you don’t have on any jewellery, do you?"
14510,Leonard,"yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. you put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?"
15798,Leonard,"uh, cream."
12044,Leonard,"uh, yes."
19207,Leonard,"well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big deal financially. it seems like something we should talk about."
19503,Leonard,do you mean that?
20611,Leonard,i was afraid he was gonna eat me.
13947,Leonard,"no, no, she’s too proud to ask for the money. i, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt."
18811,Leonard,"well, it’s always me, take one for the team."
16974,Leonard,we should go easy on him. amy’s out with stuart tonight.
18929,Leonard,what can we do that’s different?
13208,Leonard,"yeah, there kind of does."
16858,Leonard,"no, no, i messed up a little. you messed up a lot."
13893,Leonard,weird.
21757,Leonard,"but, joyce, come on."
13832,Leonard,"neat. good work. sheldon, we’ve got to call this off."
12984,Leonard,can i go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
21288,Leonard,you’re kidding.
18868,Leonard,if only there were a solution to that.
19224,Leonard,"i, i think i still have it."
20847,Leonard,really?
16164,Leonard,that was a great meal.
20304,Leonard,"fine. mmm, penny’s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.”"
14934,Leonard,maybe we should just stop talking about this.
13678,Leonard,don’t you think if a woman was living with me i’d be the first one to know about it?
14860,Leonard,i’m glad you enjoyed it. most people aren’t that interested in what i do.
12392,Leonard,are you sure?
17343,Leonard,"keep an eye on those expiration dates, i’ve been burned more than once."
20976,Leonard,"yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where i draw the line. come on, we’ll have fun."
21165,Leonard,hold on. how did you get him in the car?
16167,Leonard,no kidding.
12042,Leonard,hi.
12009,Leonard,thank-you. we’ll be right back.
18493,Leonard,really?
21682,Leonard,"yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? really? how much for three?"
20375,Leonard,"right? to this day, i send her a card every year with a little money in it."
14751,Leonard,what? who would tell you something like that? why would you tell her something like that?
14757,Leonard,what are you doing? he’s not a lost dog.
16246,Leonard,"oh, sounds great."
14765,Leonard,why should i let it go? why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? 
16479,Leonard,all right.
13175,Leonard,"so you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. it’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness. "
14624,Leonard,right.
15263,Leonard,it’s good that we got out and did something physical.
14060,Leonard,"oh, for god’s sake, sheldon."
19494,Leonard,"on earth? in our lives? that, that, that we’re living?"
12149,Leonard,"what? oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn."
13022,Leonard,"i don’t know, raj. maybe the comic book store doesn’t have a bulletin board.  what’s going on?"
13992,Leonard,"you brought your husband to work, you know the rules. meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha."
19005,Leonard,and you were so good in the tv commercial.
15785,Leonard,"i don’t know. when i’m in bed with a girl, it’s just, it’s my go to response."
16235,Leonard,"it’s not a party. it’s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there."
13600,Leonard,that’s just ridiculous. why are you cooperating with him?
14023,Leonard,there’s no way we can get to the ridge. the chemistry department has us completely cut off.
12591,Leonard,whatever you recommend.
16507,Leonard,my water. you’re drinking it.
21731,Leonard,what’s the difference?
19833,Leonard,that would be more helpful if e.t. were real.
17893,Leonard,no.
13080,Leonard,"no. but it was okay. i mean, when i was little i’d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday i came home from my cello lesson, and i saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when i got to the door i could hear people whispering, and i could smell german chocolate cake, which is my favourite."
12348,Leonard,i see.
14059,Leonard,"if it were your head, it would be."
13227,Leonard,so it’s nothing i did? it’s her problem? 
18602,Leonard,"hey, sheldon sent us all an e-mail. happy holidays from texas. and there’s pictures. aah! don’t open them. do not open them."
18948,Leonard,"well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too."
18647,Leonard,hey. can we talk?
21544,Leonard,do you really care about that last one?
19625,Leonard,what’s wrong?
15733,Leonard,what are you working on?
20161,Leonard,"if you’re cranky and retaining water, i have a theory."
21289,Leonard,"you know, i do have a way to get him out of our hair. i’ve been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now’s the time."
20876,Leonard,i didn’t even have to take my glasses off/
15802,Leonard,sounds great.
16935,Leonard,they’re in a group. i’m scared.
13403,Leonard,"howard, help me out here."
13625,Leonard,"okay, i’m going to make this very simple for you. you are not in this relationship, i am. ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and stephanie."
13504,Leonard,here you go.
14712,Leonard,because of the reasons that penny will now tell you. penny?
18114,Leonard,"got it. oh. there. oh, yeah. yeah, now i’m feeling it. oh, this is great. i could do this for the rest of my life. hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did i read that you’re on that-that tenure committee?"
15704,Leonard,you’re saying i couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.
18681,Leonard,i’m gonna go talk to penny. 
15808,Leonard,priya and i are both adults. we didn’t betray raj.
21389,Leonard,hey.
19983,Leonard,what happened now?
19317,Leonard,i’ll be right back.
20569,Leonard,"if there was a nobel prize for millennium falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we’d be set."
21213,Leonard,"fine, go ahead."
19515,Leonard,"yeah, i’m proud of him, too."
16332,Leonard,"uh, i kind of have a problem i was hoping you could help me with."
19327,Leonard,"wow, donkey kong. this, this was my game when i was a kid."
19033,Leonard,"whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions."
12548,Leonard,"fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that’s twelve, we’ll each have four. "
20707,Leonard,sure. i’d like to meet her.
13270,Leonard,"alright, alright. well, uh, nevertheless, i have one now and i would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce."
15360,Leonard,"uh, six."
17290,Leonard,why would you do that?
16101,Leonard,are you an element in the actinoid series?
15553,Leonard,"palak paneer, that’s penny."
16615,Leonard,that doesn’t sound like mocking.
15752,Leonard,"i guess the difference is, i have some self-respect."
15561,Leonard,you’re in your bedroom.
20121,Leonard,"well, it’s thai food night."
18248,Leonard,calm down. i’m getting out. i have something i want to give you.
16537,Leonard,that’s nice. what about?
16125,Leonard,no!
18615,Leonard,"oh, madame curie."
21346,Leonard,she’s gonna hate how often we say the word panels.
21023,Leonard,"oh, yeah, there he is."
15956,Leonard,"well, then, what do you want?"
17503,Leonard,great. just relax and enjoy. tonight is all about you.
12936,Leonard,"um, eight.  point four. "
12324,Leonard,you don’t have buffets in india?
17061,Leonard,glad i was sitting down for that. did you and amy get in a fight?
17906,Leonard,"our clothes, our wallets, phones."
15923,Leonard,you’ll never guess what just happened.
20333,Leonard,i don’t know. it’s pretty catchy.
13910,Leonard,so you’re a little behind on your bills. everybody gets behind on their bills.
18707,Leonard,how did she get you to do yoga?
15945,Leonard,a lot of people are doing that.
15959,Leonard,ba-ba-ba-ba. are you sure you want to include him in this?
16958,Leonard,couple of weirdos. why?
13025,Leonard,howard…
16634,Leonard,i don’t want to talk about it. you didn’t catch bugs from penny’s chair.
21533,Leonard,i can’t believe the air force would treat us like that.
17837,Leonard,sheldon’s assistant asked me on a date last night.
18513,Leonard,the math is all there. it’s not real.
12913,Leonard,how exactly would that laugh go? 
16019,Leonard,"if it makes you feel any better, when i was dating penny, she used to flip out on me all the time."
15306,Leonard,"okay, when you say seeing penny, what exactly does that mean?"
12193,Leonard,you are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  what’s funny?
12981,Leonard,"the lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?"
17549,Leonard,"no, what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track."
20762,Leonard,"waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets."
12631,Leonard,is this all stuff you want me to try on?
15406,Leonard,"you heard that, huh?"
17687,Leonard,"hey, look who’s out after dark, like a big boy."
21552,Leonard,great. tonight he wants to look at ladders at home depot.
15244,Leonard,no.
20311,Leonard,i’m glad you had a nice time with amy.
21118,Leonard,"you’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?"
21386,Leonard,"you know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it’s yours."
19723,Leonard,so i’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
16761,Leonard,two for thirty. and you come to my birthday party.
19704,Leonard,what?
14998,Leonard,"mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after peter pan cut it off."
12976,Leonard,"so, when it’s your turn you can."
20764,Leonard,"so, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?"
13930,Leonard,"do you guys remember penny’s ex-boyfriend kurt?  yeah, that’s him. it turns out he owes penny a lot of money, and i’m gonna go get it from him."
13205,Leonard,what? 
18242,Leonard,"thank you, sheldon. that must’ve been very hard for you to say."
13077,Leonard,i don’t celebrate my birthday.
15354,Leonard,"uh, sleep night. i mean, obviously, good night. i started to say sleep tight, then i changed my mind in the middle. i swear to god, i’m smart."
13397,Leonard,"goodnight, sheldon."
15478,Leonard,doesn’t have to be tonight. i’m free pretty much always.
12499,Leonard,"because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive. "
15316,Leonard,his mother?
12799,Leonard,oh great.
21136,Leonard,"yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you."
19626,Leonard,i’m so sorry.
20031,Leonard,i figured that out.
12587,Leonard,his mom’s been saying that for years. what’s up?
21078,Leonard,"i wet the bed until college, but i don’t think that’s a quality fix."
13421,Leonard,maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
15695,Leonard,you have a girlfriend? how could you have a girlfriend? you can’t even speak to women.
18563,Leonard,"come on, don’t give him a hard time."
21530,Leonard,"it’s a secure lab in a classified facility, only the u.s. government and us."
20914,Leonard,buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as i did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.
17194,Leonard,fine.
19308,Leonard,thank you. sorry.
18634,Leonard,you still got the part. that’s a huge accomplishment.
18173,Leonard,great.
19724,Leonard,you want some of this? i’ll give you some.
14370,Leonard,what was it doing on the ceiling?
20892,Leonard,you only had one.
20560,Leonard,good one.
16731,Leonard,see that? i just saved us forty bucks.
21405,Leonard,should we go bring him back?
14169,Leonard,i can’t believe we actually did it.
21221,Leonard,honey?
20947,Leonard,and i think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.
19526,Leonard,call me if you need anything.
20595,Leonard,"ha, ha. leonard and i are about to see suicide squad. spoiler alert, when i see you i’m gonna spoil it. you’re a good friend."
16978,Leonard,"with a hologram? nice. hey, do you see this?"
19571,Leonard,"well, we did it."
20899,Leonard,"no, you don’t. but let’s say you do. and don’t say you do, because you don’t. now, wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?"
13373,Leonard,yes.
16950,Leonard,"just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?"
17826,Leonard,"this is weird, right?"
19808,Leonard,hello? what is this?
21763,Leonard,i did notify you.
19307,Leonard,excuse me?
13344,Leonard,"okay, let’s try it this way, what if the people magazine thing is the best raj is ever going to achieve?"
13806,Leonard,he said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
13366,Leonard,yeah.
17030,Leonard,laxative.
14835,Leonard,"yes, i am. you want to see a simulation on my laptop?"
20785,Leonard,"i just said why, we don’t like her."
19955,Leonard,it is. it is about us.
19138,Leonard,"sheldon, i promise. your uvula does not have an std."
12450,Leonard,okay. 
14811,Leonard,"i fell on the floor. all right, he got you, you can get him back."
14140,Leonard,"believe me, howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don’t want to see naked."
18790,Leonard,waah. i don’t want a table.
21270,Leonard,has he ever had his own place?
14549,Leonard,"yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable."
16616,Leonard,i don’t know. why?
18134,Leonard,"okay, okay. guys, what are we doing here?"
20108,Leonard,"guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we’re scientists. don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science?"
18366,Leonard,except this is totally about my mom.
18787,Leonard,"oh, i’m sorry."
13437,Leonard,"excuse me. sheldon, we both agreed to do this."
15158,Leonard,and in the darkness bind them.
12496,Leonard,how much have you had to drink tonight?
20436,Leonard,hey. what happened? is amy gone?
18584,Leonard,"hey, buddy."
21603,Leonard,i’m back. 
17700,Leonard,"you know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us."
13265,Leonard,terrific.
15828,Leonard,hey.
21003,Leonard,i just wanted to make her work for it.
14080,Leonard,"what is it, sheldon? "
18704,Leonard,"you got your job back. that is great news. i didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. to plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane."
16159,Leonard,why?
16324,Leonard,"or as you probably call it back home, food."
21290,Leonard,"you can’t kill him, he’ll just respawn at the last save point."
19884,Leonard,oh. done and done.
20840,Leonard,"penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. but i don’t think i’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. you know, maybe i don’t"
13694,Leonard,"no, everything’s fine."
19655,Leonard,hey.
13811,Leonard,"hey, you got a minute?"
13949,Leonard,"no, the problem isn’t solved. he just blew us off."
21733,Leonard,"uh, yeah, experimental physics."
20800,Leonard,"and his girlfriend, amy."
14011,Leonard,"i’m sorry, i didn’t hear anything after lick."
18039,Leonard,why? what happened?
12779,Leonard,they asked me to come in.
17726,Leonard,i’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.
19924,Leonard,hey.
17607,Leonard,"sheldon, we haven’t won a game all night. now, you either stick your face in that pie or i’m gonna stick that pie in your face."
16079,Leonard,"howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?"
17464,Leonard,is it still weird ’cause i proposed?
13301,Leonard,"yeah, that’s great, you guys want corn dogs?"
18679,Leonard,"okay, listen, i don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but i’m a little distracted right now."
14680,Leonard,so you could teach me?
14829,Leonard,"sure. the more, the merrier."
14342,Leonard,"all right, well, off the top of my head, i think the most important thing with penny is to go really slow. i mean, glacial."
16738,Leonard,"it never is, is it?"
16898,Leonard,sounds like most of my dates.
12447,Leonard,"hey, sorry we’re late. "
15169,Leonard,this ring.
14689,Leonard,"i’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. i can’t believe they had one for dogs."
12259,Leonard,"or dinner. i was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time."
15282,Leonard,i never stopped hanging out with you.
14314,Leonard,"you know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, raj."
18412,Leonard,"sheldon, i know you’re in the zone, but do you want some tea? all right, i can’t believe i’m gonna say this, but you haven’t spoken in hours and i’m starting to get worried. please say something."
16392,Leonard,nice shot.
15182,Leonard,fine. but can’t we go home and start this?
15262,Leonard,"this is fun, huh?"
17350,Leonard,"mmm, you liked professor guyster’s wedding."
13193,Leonard,i didn’t say anything like that.
16552,Leonard,in my bed?
13291,Leonard,"if the word is pee-pee, just do it."
19954,Leonard,i know. you think people are gonna be mad?
19046,Leonard,i’m not.
20501,Leonard,i’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
17610,Leonard,have you noticed that howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?
14521,Leonard,"i’m okay. just a little mouthwash, and then i’m gonna rock your world. "
12297,Leonard,just say the but thing about doug and then i’ll get her back. 
14254,Leonard,no.
15698,Leonard,…who’s a friend.
12606,Leonard,i wonder who’s going to tell his parents they’re not having grandchildren. 
16870,Leonard,you do?
12372,Leonard,thank you sheldon.
20432,Leonard,can you please live with us forever?
12213,Leonard,stay in formation.
17339,Leonard,do you mind if i spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
17037,Leonard,"sheldon, we can’t let him drive."
12479,Leonard,"no, i said animalistic. of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. "
20490,Leonard,and his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
16187,Leonard,hey. hi.
20167,Leonard,look at me go.
17801,Leonard,"oh, uh, yeah. i got ’em on amazon."
13340,Leonard,are you proud of yourself?
14813,Leonard,good.
13229,Leonard,"yeah, hi, listen, i know what’s been bothering you about us, and i have the answer. "
14402,Leonard,did she seem upset to you?
16662,Leonard,"oh. well, i have some work to do, so…"
12434,Leonard,"but thanks, thanks for thinking of us."
18995,Leonard,"hey, how were things on the set?"
18574,Leonard,"oh, i hope it’s just a sprain. i cannot walk into that e.r. with another video game injury."
15796,Leonard,"uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great."
12762,Leonard,here we go. 
16011,Leonard,"uh, no. oh, this is zack. he’s a friend of ours. zack, this is stuart. he owns the store."
12692,Leonard,"no, it’s this friday, at eight. "
18126,Leonard,do anything interesting today?
16047,Leonard,"it’s not boring at all. you see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…"
17128,Leonard,yes.
17072,Leonard,"look, howard, i’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but i watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. do not throw her back."
15520,Leonard,whatcha doin’ there? working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
16641,Leonard,not good?
15275,Leonard,"no, no, it’s fine. i don’t care. i’m over it."
19127,Leonard,"look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter."
12129,Leonard,"uh, i’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up."
21334,Leonard,sounds like you’re gonna need a cheaper place to live.
13518,Leonard,"look, here’s the thing, um, i talked to sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line."
16280,Leonard,"sorry! pardon me! oh, i’m so sorry! my fault! check it out. i just got contacts."
17542,Leonard,"yup. i told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist, i’d take him for ice cream."
20874,Leonard,no way.
21016,Leonard,why would you tell him that? that’s terrible advice.
12131,Leonard,"ask him for a napkin, i dare you.  i’ll get it."
15132,Leonard,whoa! what do you mean all?
18892,Leonard,thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.
19600,Leonard,"are you kidding? no, no."
15038,Leonard,"okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. good night."
15136,Leonard,sheldon’s in jail?
13330,Leonard,chosen by science?
13703,Leonard,"careful, if you don’t get it all, it’ll only come back worse."
15981,Leonard,we get it. 73 is the chuck norris of numbers.
16428,Leonard,lucky bastard.
14966,Leonard,does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?
20628,Leonard,that’s right.
19036,Leonard,i hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.
14493,Leonard,"there’s more to life than sex, raj."
19288,Leonard,like i would swing with him.
20256,Leonard,"ah, well, what’s this? a pot of oatmeal? or, thanks to you, what i will now call gloatmeal."
12858,Leonard,"hang on, are we talking about murdering dennis kim? i’m not saying no. "
16594,Leonard,i don’t want to talk to amy.
19489,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s fine."
14170,Leonard,i’ll print out the shipping label. uh-oh.
15876,Leonard,did something happen today that’s bothering you?
12124,Leonard,"no, it was a valid hypothesis."
18346,Leonard,"actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because indy had the medallion. without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place."
15926,Leonard,a big kiss. on the mouth.
17929,Leonard,"so, cocoa?"
20118,Leonard,do i really have to do that now?
16580,Leonard,yes.
12257,Leonard,"good afternoon penny, so hi, hey. uh… i was wondering if you had plans for dinner."
15048,Leonard,"yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan."
18385,Leonard,your father’s a gynaecologist.
17429,Leonard,he keeps emergency purell in the car.
17190,Leonard,aaargh. what the hell?
21283,Leonard,"that’s great, but the air force approved the specs. we’re good to go."
17842,Leonard,i’m androgynous?
15400,Leonard,i don’t?
13745,Leonard,"wow, y-yeah, sure. yeah, no problem. uh, here’s my home number, here’s my cell, here’s my office, here’s my parents’ number up in new jersey, they always know how to reach me. so…"
20368,Leonard,thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
20384,Leonard,"well, we are, because dr. gallo made me realize that i’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter."
16814,Leonard,"hey, you got a minute?"
16887,Leonard,"yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?"
17284,Leonard,"congratulations, sheldon. you win office."
17056,Leonard,"oh, a little red dead redemption, huh?"
13417,Leonard,oh.
21106,Leonard,"let me guess, you want it."
17605,Leonard,"get up, we can’t lose at math."
17624,Leonard,"you know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram."
20020,Leonard,yes. i felt guilty as soon as it happened. i feel guilty every time i see her.
19647,Leonard,yup. got the code.
18658,Leonard,"okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback."
20703,Leonard,that sounds fun.
15475,Leonard,"oh, hey."
15222,Leonard,"good evening, ladies and gentlemen. my name is dr. leonard hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s chancellor’s award for science and my good friend, dr. sheldon cooper. but before i do, i’d like to share with you a letter from sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. isn’t that nice? his mother sent him a letter. she’s proud of him. i wonder what that feels like. dear shelly. that’s what she calls him. shelly, it’s a pet name. you know what my mother’s pet name for me is? leonard. but i digress. dear shelly. i am so proud of… "
16103,Leonard,shh-shh-shh-shh. sheldon’s asleep. what’s going on?
12311,Leonard,"this? no. no, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy."
20818,Leonard,what?
18951,Leonard,may the force be with you. get it?
15693,Leonard,"hey, guys."
13255,Leonard,"hey, leslie."
19371,Leonard,"oh, not fun. the doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses."
12038,Leonard,"yes, and you’ve never met one of them."
19529,Leonard,"we all got the christmas card, cinnamon."
14442,Leonard,"oh, thank god we’re home."
15734,Leonard,"ah, you’re going off the grid."
20176,Leonard,"come on, barry, there’s a swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. can’t you spare any?"
13708,Leonard,"sure, when is scary not good? but, okay, um, i have feelings, right?"
12250,Leonard,"oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move. i mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway. "
12223,Leonard,not much. bro. 
21353,Leonard,"yeah. it can get chilly, but raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. here’s the hotel room we all share. "
18342,Leonard,"seriously, please find another book."
12298,Leonard,"ugh, don’t get me started on rebound sex."
17766,Leonard,because i can never understand your side.
15793,Leonard,"oh, uh, yeah, i was trying to see if i could laugh as a woman."
17682,Leonard,i’m sorry. i was just trying to help.
13164,Leonard,"now that i’m actually about to go out with penny, i’m not excited, i’m nauseous. "
17557,Leonard,"sheldon, aren’t you going to introduce us?"
19519,Leonard,your george lucas autograph is really a me autograph.
18311,Leonard,"geez, i never realized you were so competitive."
20514,Leonard,one day. right.
18068,Leonard,"sheldon, come on. it’s getting late. time to go."
12920,Leonard,"leslie, i have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that i…"
21323,Leonard,"dig deep, like when we bet you couldn’t fit into howard’s pants."
17106,Leonard,"wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question."
19115,Leonard,what’s the big deal?
17792,Leonard,would you just look inside?
15676,Leonard,didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas?
16114,Leonard,no.
14093,Leonard,"well, that does sound much simpler. how long is this going to take?"
19966,Leonard,hmm?
17578,Leonard,what do you got?
12684,Leonard,what the hell is that? 
12112,Leonard,just grab the door.
12735,Leonard,thanks penny. 
18372,Leonard,who just had sex with me at work.
20070,Leonard,what else would it be?
13554,Leonard,okay.
15307,Leonard,fine. why did you have dinner with penny?
13517,Leonard,"penny, can i talk to you for a minute? hi."
21216,Leonard,"go ahead, it’s fine."
16032,Leonard,what about me?
19116,Leonard,"well, yeah, it’s true. you, you are a god to me."
17127,Leonard,"the, the gas station across the street."
15546,Leonard,when would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
12426,Leonard,"oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose."
13712,Leonard,"i just ate, aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?"
18069,Leonard,that’s what you said five minutes ago. amy and penny are already in the car. let’s move it.
15447,Leonard,"oh, sorry, i didn’t know you were busy. maybe another time."
13786,Leonard,lactose.
14840,Leonard,excuse me?
19693,Leonard,cooper and his team?
14787,Leonard,"oh, god, i am so hungry."
12373,Leonard,"what did penny mean, you’d make a cute couple?"
18300,Leonard,i think it sounds fun.
12972,Leonard,yeah. it is by far the coolest thing i have ever owned. 
16703,Leonard,"oh, god, did you watch bridget jones again?"
18352,Leonard,"i do, too, but there’s not."
15321,Leonard,you’re taking him to disneyland?
12815,Leonard,"okay, it’s on."
14635,Leonard,will you at least think about it? just as a favour to me?
17583,Leonard,"all right, pictionary. what are the teams?"
16570,Leonard,fine.
14557,Leonard,"no, i don’t want any chocolate! sheldon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat."
19438,Leonard,what do we do? should we call someone?
18691,Leonard,and i support you.
15813,Leonard,"okay fine, i’m, i’m a horrible human being, i’m the darth vader of pasadena."
16884,Leonard,"hi, amy."
16081,Leonard,"no. i mean, what are you doing with a theremin?"
17554,Leonard,"if you want help, just hire a grad student."
12938,Leonard,go ahead.
19958,Leonard,"you know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us."
18454,Leonard,"if you would have told me when i was a kid that someday i would be doing science next to professor proton, i would not have believed you."
13872,Leonard,i’m sorry. can we please just do it one more time?
20925,Leonard,keep m&m’s in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.
18354,Leonard,whatcha doin’?
21434,Leonard,i’m sure i’m overreacting.
18337,Leonard,are you kidding me?
12270,Leonard,six thirty. 
15085,Leonard,you really think i belong with benedict arnold and judas?
19863,Leonard,how’d you get ready so fast?
12362,Leonard,i’m sorry. give him a hamburger. 
13218,Leonard,i’m coming! 
12793,Leonard,"five movies, two hours apiece. it’s a start. "
12391,Leonard,"i’m good, i’m good to go. "
15020,Leonard,"hello. yeah, i’m leonard hofstadter. yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. oh, god, is he okay? yeah, alright, alright, i’ll be right there."
18522,Leonard,"yeah, they are."
13279,Leonard,i sure hope so.
21320,Leonard,"this is an euler’s disk. it’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy."
15662,Leonard,sheldon.
14142,Leonard,let’s go. we’re going to miss the coming attractions.
21381,Leonard,"aw, man, did you see this post from raj?"
21431,Leonard,"i know, but he was my friend first. it’s like she’s stealing him and they’re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together."
16521,Leonard,"so, how is she?"
15863,Leonard,"you are beautiful, you know that? you pop, sparkle and buzz electric. i’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
13324,Leonard,"that’s not what she’s doing, leslie, she’s just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex."
16739,Leonard,got it. can i have my water?
16026,Leonard,"okay, listen. you don’t have to wear the wig. at this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl."
17928,Leonard,want me to make you some tea?
19117,Leonard,just tell her.
13278,Leonard,a little.
21586,Leonard,stop it.
17667,Leonard,no. you need to give me some advice.
15623,Leonard,"i gotta tell you guys, i’m a little worried about sheldon."
17426,Leonard,"come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the russians."
13120,Leonard,what about “damsel in distress?”
14774,Leonard,"come on, you guys can’t be that hard up."
16248,Leonard,just sit here.
21235,Leonard,"listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple."
14218,Leonard,"you’re right. it’s anything can happen thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!"
13436,Leonard,"so, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. once again, i’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach snapple into a helium neon laser. short answer is… don’t. and now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is dr. sheldon cooper. dr. cooper?"
15502,Leonard,"yeah, we all are."
20742,Leonard,ugh. too much wine.
21200,Leonard,are you gonna laugh at the answer?
16722,Leonard,"oh, that’s pretty steep."
20336,Leonard,aw.
12500,Leonard,probably. 
20937,Leonard,"the world may have forgotten about dance dance revolution, but not this smooth criminal."
19518,Leonard,"hello, can you hear me? sheldon, i haven’t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years."
18122,Leonard,gentlemen.
19215,Leonard,"well, maybe we have lost our focus."
17971,Leonard,"oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? i take a lot of medicine."
20565,Leonard,"hang on. maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too."
18509,Leonard,why isn’t this bothering you? isn’t your brain getting itchy? this is on your card. this could be ruining your credit score. why isn’t this making you crazy?
16756,Leonard,yeah.
18188,Leonard,"i bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. in a way, their discoveries are your discoveries."
20991,Leonard,should’ve punched that guy.
18540,Leonard,"yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. on monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over."
17283,Leonard,"all right, that’s enough trash talk. one, two, three."
12050,Leonard,at least i didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
21140,Leonard,you promise?
12544,Leonard,i see a problem. 
21435,Leonard,i don’t want to sound like a jealous baby.
15438,Leonard,"howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? we need it locked onto the sea of tranquility."
14560,Leonard,"no, you’re not sanding penny."
12376,Leonard,"well, what do you think."
17851,Leonard,"um, why would i mean alex?"
14122,Leonard,so?
21085,Leonard,"if it helps, i’m questioning your life choices, too."
18849,Leonard,"oh, come on."
13284,Leonard,sure.
12204,Leonard,"it is an inefficient design, for example penny has a flat screen tv, which means all the space behind it is wasted."
20831,Leonard,"well, nothing happened, right? it’s over. until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again."
20663,Leonard,"because i am tired of him always getting his way. we don’t need a stupid meeting. we don’t even need a roommate agreement, and i hope that sandwich does cause a party."
13617,Leonard,not the right seats. 
16252,Leonard,really? levar burton’s coming here?
12219,Leonard,"you betrayed us for money, who are you?"
21485,Leonard,we’re pinned down.
17594,Leonard,"mmm, in all fairness, pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. it’s a pretty well-rounded game."
19903,Leonard,"subtle, mom, real subtle."
14816,Leonard,"sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on kripke, like, uh, like, how the joker got back at batman for putting him in the arkham asylum for the criminally insane."
17508,Leonard,"oh, i’ll get it. go sports."
14276,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, are you coming?"
19502,Leonard,"sheldon, i, i’m sorry if i hurt your feelings. i’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while."
14328,Leonard,why would he call me?
17981,Leonard,no.
19099,Leonard,okay.
19858,Leonard,"okay, we should leave in about an hour. you all packed?"
18974,Leonard,that’s true.
14582,Leonard,"don’t worry, you’ll find another job."
16967,Leonard,really?
17760,Leonard,"oh, mummies and zombies again."
13866,Leonard,"sheldon, what are you doing?"
19089,Leonard,he just made that easier.
17032,Leonard,"uh, yeah. sure, i guess."
14306,Leonard,"yeah, vaguely."
21187,Leonard,ignore him. how did you get the baby to stop crying?
13112,Leonard,"oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead. "
14109,Leonard,you’re going to need more than 11 hours.
13346,Leonard,"not really, it’s what you and i would call condescension."
16705,Leonard,are we ready to order?
20214,Leonard,what is it?
18060,Leonard,it’s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.
16071,Leonard,but i fired you.
19817,Leonard,hey.
14711,Leonard,"oh, gee, sheldon, i don’t think we can play on sunday."
17460,Leonard,have a nice night.
20175,Leonard,"hey, barry, we’re in trouble. we need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?"
14884,Leonard,now i’m less fine.
14620,Leonard,"no, i haven’t."
14476,Leonard,what can i tell you? they probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass costco over there.
21365,Leonard,do you think she’s as honest with you?
13663,Leonard,that’s absurd.
17714,Leonard,yes. thank you.
18080,Leonard,what information?
12664,Leonard,"i didn’t skip it, it’s just an anecdote. it’s not science."
12211,Leonard,"don’t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about."
13168,Leonard,tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
15342,Leonard,why didn’t you tell me you knew elizabeth plimpton? i am a huge fan of hers!
18025,Leonard,and i’m cool with surprises. but nothing on a jumbotron. i don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.
15708,Leonard,thank you.
18144,Leonard,"oh, please, don’t do that."
20056,Leonard,you guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?
13889,Leonard,why?
20714,Leonard,hang on.
14057,Leonard,why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?
12438,Leonard,"we all have other costumes, we can change."
14870,Leonard,"um, tomorrow?"
13266,Leonard,i kind of have other plans tonight.
14460,Leonard,come on. we said we were sorry.
21148,Leonard,"if we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky."
15934,Leonard,what? why?
16825,Leonard,"i met this girl, and she’s great. we have a lot in common."
17694,Leonard,"trust me, call her."
14449,Leonard,it was the only way to make him happy.
17595,Leonard,en el acelerador de particulares.
14684,Leonard,yes.
12610,Leonard,"hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did."
16367,Leonard,really?
21689,Leonard,"members of the faculty, students, i’m excited to speak to you today. i can’t help but remember the last time i was in this auditorium. two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. but enough about my ten-year reunion. i’d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it."
16540,Leonard,hell hounds.
14008,Leonard,you know what the saddest part was?
16627,Leonard,that’s three minutes. should we see what we got?
16462,Leonard,"morning, sheldon."
20297,Leonard,what? i didn’t know you had a journal.
21361,Leonard,"no, i want you to go."
12151,Leonard,"i’m doing this to be a good neighbour. in any case, there’s no way it could lower the odds."
16502,Leonard,"gals? who are you, fred flintstone?"
17419,Leonard,hello.
20218,Leonard,ma’am.
16536,Leonard,"hey, what took you guys so long?"
15424,Leonard,"hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?"
17321,Leonard,"w-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. no hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m."
12558,Leonard,so?
13579,Leonard,"if i knew you were waiting, i would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole."
17457,Leonard,yeah.
16283,Leonard,"yeah, good. new contacts. i should have done this years ago."
16538,Leonard,that’s funny.
16517,Leonard,"howard and his mother are at the hospital. come on, we gotta go."
12033,Leonard,bye. 
13325,Leonard,"leslie, you are way off base here."
13792,Leonard,"oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. very thoughtful."
13809,Leonard,"come on, is that really necessary?"
13320,Leonard,wow.
21268,Leonard,because i didn’t want to sound like a jerk.
15893,Leonard,"thank you, amy."
13141,Leonard,"oh, sure. huh, maybe i am her gay friend. "
21420,Leonard,tina?
14247,Leonard,should we talk to some of these women?
19360,Leonard,what makes you think i didn’t go to my prom? i went.
17134,Leonard,no.
15965,Leonard,"just for the record, i did not want to be a part of this."
15575,Leonard,"except in knight rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter."
15960,Leonard,fines?
12690,Leonard,no you don’t. he doesn’t.
19999,Leonard,"oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals."
16659,Leonard,"that’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, i’m gonna give it to you."
19217,Leonard,fine. then we’ll just stay here and do it.
15661,Leonard,"why can’t he have a desk, sheldon?"
16723,Leonard,hang on. can you do any better?
12868,Leonard,"okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with dennis. "
12331,Leonard,"you know, i’m sure if you just apologised to gablehauser he would give you your job back."
19093,Leonard,"um, let me just have some coffee first, and then i’ll have the strength to tell you how much i won’t be doing that.  hello?"
15427,Leonard,"yeah, we’re really close. uh, uh, we’re at the apartment. "
21539,Leonard,"so, are you excited to have your own place again?"
15345,Leonard,i can’t believe he’s friends with elizabeth plimpton.
16920,Leonard,thanks. tickets are eleven bucks. not a date.
14643,Leonard,"kites, ho!"
20025,Leonard,i asked you over and over if you were okay. why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?
20597,Leonard,"listen, we did a stupid thing."
12933,Leonard,"come on, think, leslie."
21297,Leonard,"as a cooling solution, it’s pretty cool."
20656,Leonard,this meeting is a waste of time. whether we make the switch from post raisin bran to kellogg’s raisin bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
13355,Leonard,you can stop smiling now.
19374,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m gonna get the surgery, it’s no big deal. end of story."
14487,Leonard,why does it have to get weird?
17396,Leonard,"look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them."
14967,Leonard,"hey, there’s no reason for you to be scared."
20389,Leonard,and it’s gone.
18630,Leonard,"i know, but you’re going to be a tv star and you haven’t left me yet. that takes guts."
20844,Leonard,that was almost a minute.
12526,Leonard,"penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay. "
20839,Leonard,"and he can’t wait to meet you, too. can i get anyone a drink?"
18692,Leonard,no. you’re on vacation.
12528,Leonard,here you go.
15636,Leonard,what?
18711,Leonard,can we please have some privacy?
19048,Leonard,"well, well, we might want to live together."
13066,Leonard,and he’s down!
15689,Leonard,"um, shut up."
15421,Leonard,that was part of it. the other part is what happened with the elevator.
16998,Leonard,thanks.
20670,Leonard,i don’t want to.
12072,Leonard,no.
18328,Leonard,to the tar pits.
19209,Leonard,i know. i was looking forward to it.
15779,Leonard,"oh, uh, building manager. they have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two."
19133,Leonard,"sheldon, why are you doing this?"
20521,Leonard,"uh, nice guy. but it was a little weird to hear batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy."
16042,Leonard,yeah.
16593,Leonard,"i’m not in the mood, sheldon."
15094,Leonard,why are you doing this?
17468,Leonard,"sheldon, what channel is nasa tv?"
21654,Leonard,"yeah, hi. listen, i just got a text from raj. he wanted me to tell you that when howard says nap, he means sex."
12729,Leonard,"oh, okay, alright, good. "
12590,Leonard,thank you. this drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. thank you. 
21107,Leonard,"you know what, sheldon, take it. in fact, you can have everything, i really don’t care."
12117,Leonard,i’m sorry.
12659,Leonard,"i wasn’t expecting such a crowd, i’m a little nervous. "
17876,Leonard,"glasses? i really don’t think that’s gonna change… oh, my god, you look so smart and hot."
17674,Leonard,"uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of the shoemaker and the elves?"
16027,Leonard,"did i do something? i mean, i tried to be friends with zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him."
15537,Leonard,never mind. i got it.
16698,Leonard,what?
17926,Leonard,"that is sheldon’s “i’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. come on, let’s just go to your place."
19703,Leonard,baby’s listening.
16790,Leonard,"oh. watch out, sheldon. this little boy casper is a g-g-g-ghost!"
13335,Leonard,"let’s see, raj was the kung palo chicken."
13821,Leonard,"okay, let’s try it this way. remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your tv back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? what did you say? oh, yes, you said you owed me one."
14503,Leonard,"trust me, this will be just fine."
20040,Leonard,what is happening?
15545,Leonard,"there’s no cholera in pasadena. just like last summer, when there was no malaria in pasadena."
13961,Leonard,great.
21124,Leonard,"no. this is the level i am stooping to. i believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy."
18477,Leonard,oh. i forgot about this. my aunt made it for me when i started college.
16977,Leonard,"oh come on, no! we just bought the regular pack."
16520,Leonard,"right, fine. i’ll tell howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his."
19285,Leonard,"yeah, i’m sorry, too. we’re about to share the rest of our lives together. it’s our money, who cares who has it?"
15057,Leonard,guess who the university is sending to switzerland to attend a conference and see the cern supercollider on february 14?
13725,Leonard,"very comforting. okay, so what do i say to her?"
19437,Leonard,do you know what a disaster this is?
19543,Leonard,"you know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when i see him lying here asleep like this, i just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face."
12320,Leonard,what?
12906,Leonard,"yes we did, i just came from it."
13817,Leonard,"okay, don’t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on."
20679,Leonard,no.
15242,Leonard,what? no.
16286,Leonard,"oh, okay. so, what’s up?"
17277,Leonard,you know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
15697,Leonard,"great. you have a girlfriend, howard’s got a girlfriend, sheldon’s got a girl…"
15667,Leonard,"oh, congratulations. have you broken it to the troll yet?"
15173,Leonard,what was that?
13097,Leonard,"really, ‘cos you don’t look like you’re swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home. "
20701,Leonard,what?
19008,Leonard,can i get you anything?
19864,Leonard,why did you need a belt?
15791,Leonard,i’m not that white. my great-great grandmother was half cherokee. i know that’s not the right kind of indian but it is something.
17079,Leonard,"okay, how do i look?"
17668,Leonard,"no, specific to my situation."
13273,Leonard,yes.
19399,Leonard,"i never thought i’d say these words, but come on, nose spider."
13998,Leonard,"oh, relax. she took sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan."
18265,Leonard,and this is me doing the titanic pose on the boat.
19034,Leonard,"hi, mom. i have some exciting news."
20033,Leonard,"how am i supposed to sleep? i’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me."
20049,Leonard,what? why?
20024,Leonard,"no, of course not. okay, look, instead of fighting, why don’t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? i was trying to lighten the mood. it’s not easy. you try it."
18329,Leonard,the clue must be in the bag.
21352,Leonard,"i know. sometimes howard wears a striped shirt so we can play where’s wolowitz? okay, now, this is us camping out in line for the avengers panel."
17933,Leonard,you’re not sick. you just don’t want to face kripke.
18316,Leonard,"you’re really mean, you know that?"
21488,Leonard,"doing it right now. oh, they can’t. there’s an important little league game tomorrow."
21225,Leonard,"i don’t want to play a game, sheldon."
16619,Leonard,"oh, good."
15620,Leonard,john and yoko.
20933,Leonard,i know exactly what we are gonna do.
16353,Leonard,i don’t know.
18189,Leonard,it’s important you know how much you mean to us.
14001,Leonard,you can’t let her get into your head.
20539,Leonard,"sheldon, we’ve been together so long, it’s hard to remember a time you weren’t in my life. and believe me, i try. you make me laugh. you make me a better scientist. you make me crazy. you’re more than just my roommate, you’re my brother."
20276,Leonard,you really should.
20365,Leonard,that’s just crazy. how would my going in there even help you?
21688,Leonard,i don’t get it. there’s actually peanut brittle in… please go to mars.
21509,Leonard,"of course i don’t want you to be unhappy, but i also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn’t very smart. you don’t have to stop, just slow down, i’ll jump out."
14945,Leonard,what is that?
20101,Leonard,what?
19226,Leonard,robot prostitute.
16747,Leonard,going to wheaton’s party is not betraying you.
16549,Leonard,"bernadette, that’s great. howard, do you make a buttload?"
16556,Leonard,we tried. she doesn’t get along with sheldon.
16808,Leonard,"well, you know, it’s comic con. i’m lion-o from thundercats."
13177,Leonard,what was your question again?
17791,Leonard,"all right, sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little christmas gift i got you."
18985,Leonard,"on the one hand, if i say yes…"
21611,Leonard,hey.
17551,Leonard,i didn’t know they gave nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
13186,Leonard,goodnight.  
13383,Leonard,do the shrimpers feature in your story?
14191,Leonard,sheldon…
17569,Leonard,"no. but compared to your boss, he’s the poster boy for sanity."
16961,Leonard,"hey, can i talk to you about something? it’s a little awkward."
14045,Leonard,just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
17476,Leonard,will you shut up?
18146,Leonard,"with all the tv sheldon was talking about, i had the greatest idea ever. it even blows away my idea for a star wars themed coffee shop called brewbacca’s. you need to watch buffy the vampire slayer. it is the perfect show for the two of us. it’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. i cannot oversell this. what do you say?"
15045,Leonard,that’ll be all. that was fun.
20547,Leonard,"hold on, hold on. so the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?"
16390,Leonard,"yeah, she doesn’t really understand the whole warcraft adventure-role-playing thing."
15070,Leonard,uh-huh.
20862,Leonard,hi.
16050,Leonard,"okay, we need to stop for a minute."
12827,Leonard,would the new sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old sheldon? 
12163,Leonard,no.
20777,Leonard,hey.
16343,Leonard,"penny, wait.  damned contacts."
21098,Leonard,do not tell wolowitz.
18731,Leonard,"did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a marie callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?"
12955,Leonard,"come on, snipers. "
21260,Leonard,how’s it working out?
21504,Leonard,"yeah. although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, i’m pretty sure i saw smoke coming out of his ears. you’re not really considering working for him, are you?"
20809,Leonard,"oh, we were following howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street."
19822,Leonard,my mommy raised a gentleman.
15063,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not taking you to switzerland."
16059,Leonard,are you done?
13873,Leonard,it’s a little thing but you really do miss it.
13721,Leonard,"yeah, yeah it’s all good. everything’s going to work out. one way or another."
13815,Leonard,he’s been in bed for two days.
17833,Leonard,"ah, i’d love to, but i’m supposed to hang out with penny."
12249,Leonard,none at all?
17541,Leonard,"so, i had to take sheldon to the dentist this morning."
18891,Leonard,aren’t you gonna ask me?
16340,Leonard,"i don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. the building’s plumbing."
15749,Leonard,"yep, it is."
17849,Leonard,yeah. and the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.
18817,Leonard,"oh, hey. you guys didn’t break up."
20778,Leonard,"oh, sheldon invoked rosa parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad."
19401,Leonard,"oh, what’d you get?"
14736,Leonard,"hey. we’re, uh, going to the movies."
18457,Leonard,"mr. nye, hello. i’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense."
15511,Leonard,"well, then let’s un-pause it."
20172,Leonard,"i’d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month."
20169,Leonard,just tell me.
15457,Leonard,2.5 seconds for the light to return. that’s the moon! we hit the moon!
13384,Leonard,"he’s irony impaired, just move on."
12390,Leonard,oh. okay. a little musical foreplay. terrific. 
21765,Leonard,"ooh, it’s time for babylon 5!"
20044,Leonard,call you back. hey.
12644,Leonard,"uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit. "
15302,Leonard,tell me why you woke me up or i swear to god i will kill you.
16412,Leonard,"well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two."
17711,Leonard,did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
19066,Leonard,i’m gonna see where he is.
16685,Leonard,i’m not moody. i’m fun.
14500,Leonard,"sheldon, dinner’s here."
16724,Leonard,slow down. two hundred.
12954,Leonard,not to blow on a miniature time machine. 
13686,Leonard,"it is actually. in fact, i gave it a lot of thought and i decided it was time for us to live together."
16153,Leonard,uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
15548,Leonard,let’s get you to the hospital.
16421,Leonard,do you think a sexually ambivalent indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound jewish guy who lives with his mom?
15714,Leonard,"yeah, what?"
12242,Leonard,"heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes. "
18132,Leonard,do it.
18211,Leonard,"oh, that sounds romantic."
20153,Leonard,"oh. i hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her."
16911,Leonard,can’t argue with that. i’ll get the tickets.
16459,Leonard,i’d like to refer that to my attorney.
19739,Leonard,exactly.
21376,Leonard,"all right, problem solved."
12550,Leonard,"wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite penny then you would have had your fourth."
12971,Leonard,"let’s just do this. guys, ready to push?"
20230,Leonard,did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?
20270,Leonard,"yeah, okay, i see him. it looks like they’re having a nice time. i wish i could hear what they’re saying."
12572,Leonard,why?
15629,Leonard,"he takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom."
18456,Leonard,why is it odd?
16483,Leonard,"excuse me, but einstein had a pretty busy sex life."
20302,Leonard,"well, hey, okay. let me make this up to you. sometimes i keep an online journal. i want you to read something that i wrote."
18441,Leonard,is that a pregnancy test?
19617,Leonard,"yeah, thank you."
19566,Leonard,"you know, if no one’s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal."
15227,Leonard,"no, no, i’m good. if my p.e. teachers had told me this is what i was training for, i would have tried a lot harder."
21773,Leonard,"oh, this just might be your lucky day."
17119,Leonard,exactly. we pretend like our date went badly.
14245,Leonard,yeah.
16979,Leonard,you’ve got to be kidding me. you friended stuart on facebook?
16769,Leonard,"yeah, yeah, that, too."
18151,Leonard,"you can try, but nobody’s gonna believe you. i just, i don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it."
17604,Leonard,"remember, show your work."
14947,Leonard,"no, i’m sorry. i really am. it’s not right to mock what a person believes in."
16647,Leonard,"yes, ma’am."
13232,Leonard,"a place for fun, a place for knowledge. see, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal. "
12457,Leonard,then what happens?
13635,Leonard,"no, no, no, i got it."
20591,Leonard,"oh, you’re good at this."
19916,Leonard,that’s not what it is.
12121,Leonard,"thank you sheldon, you’re a good friend."
13919,Leonard,i would hope so.
12605,Leonard,so you’re not going to see her again?
15138,Leonard,so tell him to apologize.
16624,Leonard,"excuse me, that’s priya."
17686,Leonard,well answer it. i want to hear.
15200,Leonard,what?
15435,Leonard,never mind. okay if i watch some tv?
16612,Leonard,i’m proud of you.
19522,Leonard,bye.
12449,Leonard,"oh, he’s the doppler effect."
21267,Leonard,our gaming room. i was gonna put a scented candle in it.
15870,Leonard,and i may have hit on her a little bit.
20966,Leonard,oh. he can try. he’d just need a good locksmith.
14587,Leonard,"excuse me, sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?"
12915,Leonard,"so nothing, let’s destroy him. "
17835,Leonard,are we done with this?
17370,Leonard,absolutely.
19141,Leonard,yes.  
13238,Leonard,hi.
16794,Leonard,"yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil."
21679,Leonard,"excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. north sea, how can i kelp you?"
15485,Leonard,"if she can do it, i can do it. if she can do it, i can do it. if she can do it, i can do it.  i can’t do it."
19741,Leonard,i doubt it.
18005,Leonard,"i know it’s not ideal, but don’t let them ruin our night."
17695,Leonard,"keep going, buddy, you’re doing great."
18284,Leonard,fine. what i did was wrong.
18853,Leonard,so one of us came back from the future to murder stuart?
17614,Leonard,no. although howard was making some real strides in that area until he met bernadette.
12122,Leonard,we’re home.
12927,Leonard,"so, is that your team."
17349,Leonard,"all right, i think we got them all. let’s divide up the loot."
20345,Leonard,"you got it. well, penny might want to join us."
16357,Leonard,"uh, we are. in the meantime, you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us."
14978,Leonard,4am.
14090,Leonard,"well, we had a vote. three of us voted for airplane, sheldon voted for train, so we’re taking the train."
15060,Leonard,switzerland. and i get to bring a guest!
19098,Leonard,he got all of his stuff stolen.
13195,Leonard,that’s not a bad sign.
12581,Leonard,"hey, i thought you were finding new friends."
18446,Leonard,he thinks there’s a difference.
20364,Leonard,none of that is true.
15465,Leonard,how did i ruin him?
20367,Leonard,"fine, i’ll do it. but not because of them, because i love you."
18228,Leonard,"that’s the thing, you can’t. i’ll be on a ship in the north sea."
16970,Leonard,you okay?
12542,Leonard,"howard, can’t you see she’s using you?"
20290,Leonard,"next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, i believe, was also the name of your childhood dog."
13583,Leonard,"dear god, no!"
20253,Leonard,"well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life."
14574,Leonard,hey.
21481,Leonard,"if you’re that upset, go get her back."
13572,Leonard,i’m going to the office.
16572,Leonard,when were you going to tell me about this?
13242,Leonard,"relatively modern. why, what are you wearing?"
19423,Leonard,"you know what? this bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. let’s make a pact. when one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we’ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting professor abbott."
14537,Leonard,"we did, but there were extenuating circumstances."
12452,Leonard,"she’s not catwoman, she’s just a generic cat."
12179,Leonard,morning. 
17868,Leonard,i don’t know.
13769,Leonard,"see ya. ‘bye, penny. have fun. "
17673,Leonard,"i know, but i have to go to work, and i made you breakfast."
15361,Leonard,sure.
16922,Leonard,i’m going to get some fries. you want anything?
17724,Leonard,what do you mean?
19418,Leonard,really?
17206,Leonard,where do i sign?
14383,Leonard,"okay, well, do you want to go?"
17315,Leonard,i was sleeping.
21284,Leonard,can we please stop talking about poodles?
16729,Leonard,so?
20316,Leonard,whatever. can we just get back to this?
18135,Leonard,"oh, you do what you want, but i don’t want to lose my friends over tenure. friends are forever."
17346,Leonard,"uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, i think raj beat you to it."
14723,Leonard,"you know what? it is your life. if you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite the black eyed peas?"
12440,Leonard,i call frodo!
17417,Leonard,"well, howard, i don’t know much about women."
15943,Leonard,"come here, you."
18192,Leonard,i’m sorry things turned out this way.
13545,Leonard,"you’re not gonna need wingman, you’re gonna need a paramedic."
15741,Leonard,"hi, amy. sheldon’s not here."
14536,Leonard,sorry. i haven’t given her your schedule yet.
15310,Leonard,"sheldon, i don’t care if you want to be friends with penny."
15720,Leonard,that is insane.
15579,Leonard,whoa!
14299,Leonard,behold?
20354,Leonard,"um, hey, wil. what you doin’?"
19891,Leonard,"uh, i don’t know. they’re pretty different."
19351,Leonard,you’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?
13338,Leonard,"oh yeah, two zero zero eight nq sub seventeen."
16675,Leonard,"rough night, casey jones?"
12234,Leonard,so?
20387,Leonard,"remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers."
21327,Leonard,hey.
12696,Leonard,"sheldon, are you worried about your safety."
15243,Leonard,no.
21088,Leonard,"oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?"
12345,Leonard,that was three weeks ago.
13253,Leonard,"look, i like leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release."
16007,Leonard,"come on, that’s what we do. we give each other a hard time. hey, sheldon, you look like a praying mantis."
21555,Leonard,oh. i love those.
14347,Leonard,i feel terrible.
15721,Leonard,"okay, good luck."
14193,Leonard,thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
13582,Leonard,don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
13571,Leonard,"what is? no, not like that! just, leonard went to the office."
15205,Leonard,we think we can help you with your stage fright.
14085,Leonard,it’s perfect.
14504,Leonard,what’s that supposed to mean?
15552,Leonard,"here’s my chicken curry. howard, your shrimp biryani."
19124,Leonard,"hey, how’d it go with human resources?"
15304,Leonard,i’m in bed!
14847,Leonard,what?
16940,Leonard,yep.
13343,Leonard,"really, do tell."
18252,Leonard,so?
13119,Leonard,"i’m not going to do that, howard."
18969,Leonard,i got your back.
21018,Leonard,"uh, no. "
14107,Leonard,so aren’t you going to go talk to her?
16066,Leonard,"oh sheldon, stop it."
14028,Leonard,"hey, leslie."
15781,Leonard,"bifurcated uvula, sheldon!"
15177,Leonard,no jet skis.
14359,Leonard,it was?
21685,Leonard,little ball of fur.
16888,Leonard,maybe we should get you home.
13924,Leonard,"well, moving is a big deal. you have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they’re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it’s just, like… why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?"
17998,Leonard,"mmm, would you like some wine?"
16336,Leonard,"yes. there, i said it."
19928,Leonard,mmm. my pleasure.
15026,Leonard,"no, i don’t think so. we need to go home now."
21146,Leonard,are you sure? i’d really like to.
14611,Leonard,why?
15450,Leonard,"so, menus."
15265,Leonard,"mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. ooh, i’m up."
14208,Leonard,"okay, well, i’ll take you."
13415,Leonard,you don’t need air bags.
14275,Leonard,"why not? people do things right now all the time. why can’t we be right now people too. go home, pack a bag and we’ll be right now people. i have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we’ll go right now."
13776,Leonard,yippee.
12427,Leonard,"i think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent jews. "
16145,Leonard,"i guess it depends on the zombies, raj. are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? like, in 28 days, if those zombies didn’t eat, they starved."
17359,Leonard,you went to the comic-book store by yourself?
19310,Leonard,that is amazing. how long have you been collecting?
12432,Leonard,"yeah, i don’t know, penny…"
13321,Leonard,penny’s been keeping him up at night.
20952,Leonard,"no, that’s actually what we did with him when howard came back from space."
12529,Leonard,sorry about that.
13895,Leonard,"well, you clearly did something to aggravate her."
18818,Leonard,but the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year. isn’t that enough time to get your blood pressure under…
14640,Leonard,"long, long night."
21083,Leonard,"although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so i can get it on video."
20422,Leonard,"come on, you pain in the ass."
20199,Leonard,"look, you can trust us. we’re respected scientists."
14463,Leonard,it’s a snowflake. from the north pole.
17261,Leonard,where’s howard?
14527,Leonard,interesting.
17793,Leonard,"it’s actually ho, ho, ho, but you’ll get the hang of it. thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme."
20328,Leonard,"all right, just stop. this is ridiculous."
17219,Leonard,to wine and bubble wrap. and to not having to watch sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
17214,Leonard,"all right, sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, i will take you to the dentist."
17762,Leonard,maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
19964,Leonard,did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?
13609,Leonard,"uh, sheldon?"
18156,Leonard,"all right, cool. i think you’ll like the next one better. all the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse."
20060,Leonard,"i’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about."
21499,Leonard,aaargh.
14255,Leonard,i thought you were good at this. you’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
13897,Leonard,"here you go, penny. shrimp with lobster sauce."
14877,Leonard,um…
12190,Leonard,"oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night."
18965,Leonard,"oh that’s, that’s fine. go ahead."
16713,Leonard,"listen, guys, i’m sorry, i don’t mean to be rude, but i need to go call raj’s sister, who i love so much. so vastly much."
20987,Leonard,would you like an autograph?
18090,Leonard,penny.
13051,Leonard,"that’s fascinating, but i…"
18050,Leonard,you don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
14908,Leonard,are you guys drunk?
18930,Leonard,"you know what? why don’t we just ease into this. let, let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant."
17246,Leonard,what the hell are you doing?
12888,Leonard,let’s put it to a vote. all those in favour….
15751,Leonard,"or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. there are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. look, howard, i appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life."
17212,Leonard,"no, they ended up calling me sock mouth. because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth."
19165,Leonard,fine. we’ll take it right now.
21410,Leonard,i thought we were getting breakfast before work.
17817,Leonard,what are you drinking there? a little eggnog?
19795,Leonard,i’m always excited for you. i’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.
21486,Leonard,"sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?"
17314,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s three o’clock in the morning."
16899,Leonard,"well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. "
16178,Leonard,what?
13189,Leonard,"okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. it’s like saying “i’m really enjoying this meal, i’m going to slow down and savour it.” "
13159,Leonard,"sheldon, i think i’ve made a mistake. "
13950,Leonard,no. you can leave if you want to. i’m gonna see this through.
16848,Leonard,"you’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?"
16202,Leonard,yeah.
18319,Leonard,penny’s not answering my texts.
13369,Leonard,you’re joking.
14972,Leonard,what do you want?
21522,Leonard,"yeah, see, now i feel terrible, like i’m being selfish and holding you back. what? say something. yeah, that is pretty annoying."
18003,Leonard,oh.
20624,Leonard,"oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. we’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac."
19472,Leonard,no.
19756,Leonard,"uh, i’m just gonna be honest with the guy."
18436,Leonard,nothing. i love it.
21371,Leonard,that’s not it because you’re clearly upset.
12200,Leonard,six two inch dowels.
17140,Leonard,"see, she knew what always meant."
13047,Leonard,"hell, no! "
21650,Leonard,keep going. i’m listening.
18678,Leonard,"oh, my god, they’re just making you use your vacation days."
14849,Leonard,what was i supposed to tell her?
19251,Leonard,it’s late. we’ve wasted hours. can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?
16842,Leonard,"screw it, i’m going."
21099,Leonard,"hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool."
20767,Leonard,we’d still get in.
20447,Leonard,"excuse me. uh, bad news. the maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour."
12677,Leonard,"you’re right, i’m the problem, i’m the one that needs help. "
12019,Leonard,not really.
21732,Leonard,can you do that?
12506,Leonard,"oh, i don’t think she’s a whore."
13093,Leonard,"oh my god, why did you eat it?"
18010,Leonard,"isn’t it kind of nice? i mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person."
15944,Leonard,"thanks for the steak, wyatt."
19389,Leonard,"sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?"
16632,Leonard,i can’t do that.
19717,Leonard,fine.
20331,Leonard,"yup, she’s right. for every newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an edison who was just a jerk. that could totally be you."
21027,Leonard,jisovbe’ 
19109,Leonard,sheldon.
20037,Leonard,"please, tell me how i can fix it."
18654,Leonard,"yeah, i’ll call you back."
14205,Leonard,you want to watch battlestar?
16945,Leonard,"when you were telling kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as waitress in a local production of the cheesecake factory?"
15142,Leonard,"yeah, but we all want to hear it from you."
21482,Leonard,you called on him.
12317,Leonard,then i guess congratulations are in order.
13117,Leonard,"it was penny’s boyfriend’s, they broke up."
13479,Leonard,not unless she destroys tokyo.
15436,Leonard,"okay, we’ve got power to the laser."
12897,Leonard,"sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer. "
14111,Leonard,so?
14340,Leonard,"yeah, i’m sorry, it’s been broken."
14903,Leonard,"thank you, that’s very comforting."
17340,Leonard,ay papi? what is that?
12400,Leonard,"thank you. what did she mean, she’s happy for me? is she happy because i’m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that i’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. you know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person."
20738,Leonard,"well, not really."
18267,Leonard,yep. here’s some money.
12191,Leonard,"okay, look, no penny, i think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more."
15394,Leonard,is she suggesting what i think she’s suggesting?
18777,Leonard,"yes, thank you for all your help."
17866,Leonard,sure.
14130,Leonard,"delightful. listen, i don’t know what you’re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of sheldon’s mouth."
16347,Leonard,you called the police because someone hacked your world of warcraft account?
16606,Leonard,what are you doing?
16635,Leonard,"sheldon, you do this all the time. you fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion."
15452,Leonard,the laser?
17105,Leonard,"well, i don’t know how you have a relationship without talking."
17804,Leonard,great. what do you do?
21220,Leonard,earl grey?
17509,Leonard,what are you doing here? i thought you were out with sheldon and amy.
12461,Leonard,yes. but i need a wing-man.
15412,Leonard,"sure, it makes sense now. . anyway, i went upstairs and knocked on the door."
16500,Leonard,i thought the movie was about 18th-century vienna?
21567,Leonard,and you actually got in a pool?
17505,Leonard,"you’re right, i’m sorry. let’s watch the game. "
19935,Leonard,"well, of course i know why. but just for fun, why?"
13151,Leonard,"yeah, that must get old quick. "
12835,Leonard,"come on, sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything."
18907,Leonard,"so, business in the front, science in the back."
17451,Leonard,"i guess we are. so, what’s going on?"
14564,Leonard,you’re not squirting her in the face with water.
14622,Leonard,"it’s not that simple. what am i supposed to say? penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?"
20505,Leonard,"you want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
15375,Leonard,come on. it wasn’t my fault.
14965,Leonard,what are we supposed to do now?
15850,Leonard,i give up.
21407,Leonard,"well, great."
16087,Leonard,"why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question."
15280,Leonard,"so, you guys want to do something tonight?"
19142,Leonard,we are so smart.
14429,Leonard,"all right, fine. what about that really long hug? what did that mean?"
20970,Leonard,i’m very happy for you.
13409,Leonard,"penny’s taking you to the dmv, i’m going to bed."
16881,Leonard,"hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
19656,Leonard,okay.
14224,Leonard,"come on, i’ll help you pick something."
20941,Leonard,yeah.
15804,Leonard,no.
12993,Leonard,those are movies.
21626,Leonard,"okay, how’s that?"
21272,Leonard,stay out of this. you and your stupid machine started this fight.
15491,Leonard,she didn’t dump me. we were just in different places in the relationship.
18074,Leonard,"mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up."
20885,Leonard,you don’t think you’ll be bored?
16476,Leonard,that is good news. bye.
19245,Leonard,"i think it’ll be pretty clear. if not, we’ll take a vote. oh, and also…"
19263,Leonard,"uh, yeah."
16926,Leonard,great. that’ll be five dollars. i am having the best time. i’m so glad you suggested we do this.
14488,Leonard,"i mean, we were friends, and now we’re more than friends. we’re whatever this is. but why label it, right? i mean, it is what it is and…"
21774,Leonard,"the trick is to mix it into tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust."
21215,Leonard,have fun.
13131,Leonard,"okay, well, you know, this isn’t that bad. it just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who’s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales. "
19568,Leonard,you’re sure it’s good?
16591,Leonard,"oh, bernadette, please play my clarinet."
13610,Leonard,do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
16456,Leonard,schooled!
19975,Leonard,because we love each other.
13608,Leonard,she doesn’t mean it. she’s just being nice.
20686,Leonard,son of a bitch. why is that funny?
18490,Leonard,that’s stupid. why?
18212,Leonard,"so, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?"
19461,Leonard,anything?
21059,Leonard,"well, we know they were smart enough to send him away."
16274,Leonard,"last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the kama sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?"
21257,Leonard,"of course not. i mean, he’s your brother."
20148,Leonard,this is easy. i didn’t need to wear a cup.
21127,Leonard,"unbelievable. okay, uh, i don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here."
14612,Leonard,see ya. still can’t believe she’s going out with me.
15441,Leonard,"hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? penny."
17131,Leonard,"uh, uh, uh, yes, i did."
18959,Leonard,okay. yet he cried when they changed the raisin bran box.
16528,Leonard,"there are a couple of things i did with penny that might be a little silly, but…"
15898,Leonard,hugh who?
17109,Leonard,i don’t understand.
20893,Leonard,we can’t afford to lose any more time.
16743,Leonard,"for god’s sake, will you stop with the schrodinger stuff."
18765,Leonard,"well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me. "
14904,Leonard,it’s not?
18659,Leonard,"well, you have me."
15910,Leonard,"yeah, i know who it is, but why is it me?"
14098,Leonard,"yeah, maybe. meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ’cause it’s time to land in san francisco."
12724,Leonard,you still told her i lied.
19932,Leonard,and we’ve been busy with our paper.
12940,Leonard,my physics bowl trophy! 
19152,Leonard,"you don’t honestly think that, do you?"
18150,Leonard,it just makes things seem small. it diminishes them.
12576,Leonard,"actually, i read somewhere that it’s one of the most popular programmes in india. "
20527,Leonard,oh. you had a party for your 60th?
21494,Leonard,"how is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?"
21678,Leonard,"disneyland. go on, i’m listening."
19059,Leonard,okay. and when would that be?
14075,Leonard,"oh, god, i wish i had."
21232,Leonard,"okay. i don’t get it, you said make an effort, here i am making an effort. "
14883,Leonard,"fine, mom. how are you?"
19776,Leonard,"look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this."
18138,Leonard,no. we cannot lose to that jerk.
13083,Leonard,"howard, every thai restaurant in town knows you can’t eat peanuts. they see me coming they go “ah, no peanut boy!”"
17094,Leonard,"uh, it means if anyone displeases me, i don’t help them set up their printer."
16637,Leonard,it’s like living with a chihuahua.
14846,Leonard,what did i do now?
17111,Leonard,even during? ‘cause sometimes i have questions.
19146,Leonard,he’s practicing.
19386,Leonard,i’m not allergic to latex.
14671,Leonard,"okay, a complete pass. first down, new england. i think i’m starting to get this."
17360,Leonard,"wow. no, it’s great. also, uh, mint in box."
15324,Leonard,"and don’t let him go on space mountain after he eats. he’ll say he can handle it, but i promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes."
12907,Leonard,"okay, let me try it this way, uh, i was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you’re off the team. "
15212,Leonard,"um, i don’t know, maybe."
15527,Leonard,you can always get a badger and find out.
19208,Leonard,yeah.
12510,Leonard,it’s the only way we can play teams. 
15963,Leonard,"hey, baby. i love you! mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh."
19956,Leonard,right. no surprises.
19370,Leonard,i sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. this is nice. i kind of wish no one else was coming.
14195,Leonard,i’m helping.
19512,Leonard,"i thought this was gonna be boring, but it’s actually kind of fun."
12260,Leonard,really? great!
19990,Leonard,hey.
13134,Leonard,huh. okay. but my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. 
17199,Leonard,uh-huh.
16432,Leonard,"man, he’s going to be blindsided."
17727,Leonard,i liked it better when you thought i wasn’t here.
12455,Leonard,how so?
12428,Leonard,"sheldon, let it go."
20425,Leonard,fun. like your comic-con spock ears and your around the house spock ears.
19198,Leonard,why say it?
13458,Leonard,are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
18038,Leonard,"so, amy, what’s going on with your addiction study?"
15403,Leonard,she let me.
12420,Leonard,your old tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted. 
15268,Leonard,so just take your time and concentrate.
16862,Leonard,"this time, it’s your fault."
13728,Leonard,what speech?
21629,Leonard,okay-dokay
21632,Leonard,seriously? you’re getting career advice from a psychic?
14268,Leonard,"alright, back to the game."
16441,Leonard,pass the soy sauce.
21356,Leonard,"i even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go."
20601,Leonard,"buddy, i am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there."
18274,Leonard,"come on, this is silly. hey, um, i brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? it’s that sailor cap that you wanted. it’s neat, huh?"
13136,Leonard,"no. no, no, that, that would be underreacting. he did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise."
17376,Leonard,"and that’s a lie, right?"
18063,Leonard,"alright, alright. boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? thank you, astronaut howard. um, i am what’s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because i get to test theories and work with lasers. yes?"
13838,Leonard,penny.
20351,Leonard,we’re gonna have so much more fun than him.
20078,Leonard,"penny, after all these years, i still feel like maybe i don’t deserve you."
17474,Leonard,"she said no, can we drop it now?"
12088,Leonard,"no. and she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour."
15099,Leonard,some what?
13046,Leonard,how do i have penny? in what universe do i have penny?
19416,Leonard,hi. we’re from the university. we’re trying to get some information about professor abbott.
15522,Leonard,yes.
17330,Leonard,"all right, let’s do it."
19943,Leonard,great.
19479,Leonard,"hang on, why do we have to hate it?"
17405,Leonard,"whoa, it’s a little early to start dropping j-bombs, don’t you think?"
12848,Leonard,great. 
15640,Leonard,she didn’t dump me. it was mutual!
12381,Leonard,i thought you weren’t interested in me.
18962,Leonard,really?
18689,Leonard,"wow. that, that’s a big step."
14902,Leonard,i want that too. why are you here?
12849,Leonard,"okay, well, right now i’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but i really don’t need any help. "
16129,Leonard,wow. how do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
12647,Leonard,my last growth spurt. 
18064,Leonard,"uh, excellent question. um, i suppose i’ve always been into science, you know. my mother and father are scientists, so i was kind of led in that direction. uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. to be honest with you guys, when i was your age, i wanted to be a rap star. like snoop dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. yeah, no, sure, you laugh. just like my mother did. after i confided, i was derided and chided, my moms and i collided. she said my dreams were misguided. that’s just a little freestyle."
16216,Leonard,it’s leonard.
15830,Leonard,i didn’t see it.
16200,Leonard,what?
13814,Leonard,the robot didn’t hurt his feelings.
17913,Leonard,"fine, but set them to stun. if we vaporize penny, i’ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again."
17975,Leonard,"oh, get this, suddenly, sheldon wants me back because amy wants to move in with him."
21309,Leonard,"no, but when we show this nonsense to sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he’ll have to fix it."
18874,Leonard,"oh, that’s great."
12276,Leonard,"i mean, i’m a perfectly nice guy. there’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? i love pottery!” you know, there’s a pause, we both know what’s happening, i lean in, we kiss, it’s a little tentative at first but then i realise, she’s kissing me back, and she’s biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we’re going to have sex! oh god! oh, my god!"
19636,Leonard,"well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?"
21507,Leonard,"no, no, i’m not jealous, i just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your co-workers."
16234,Leonard,just come with me to raj’s.
14901,Leonard,"what do you want, sheldon?"
17811,Leonard,the walls are getting slower.
20401,Leonard,"yes. and howard’s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn’t have to stay."
18136,Leonard,i’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.
19696,Leonard,it’s kind of a big deal.
21104,Leonard,so you think you should keep it?
21738,Leonard,"okay, i suppose i could drive you. well that’s a point in my favour, right?"
15572,Leonard,refresh my memory. why didn’t i just put you in the trunk?
14446,Leonard,"me, neither. except for one night when the heat went out. long story, it’s… don’t ask."
20982,Leonard,"yeah, well, if it’s a dollar, you’re in luck."
12089,Leonard,uh-huh.
13851,Leonard,i suppose. i do miss whistling though.
12310,Leonard,yeah.
15705,Leonard,no.
14331,Leonard,no.
15911,Leonard,sheldon? sheldon?
15050,Leonard,"well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either."
13145,Leonard,just eat your tangerine chicken. 
19275,Leonard,i was hoping we could talk about the money again.
13296,Leonard,"truth, what truth? we’re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it’s no big deal."
20191,Leonard,"a little, but if i may quote einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man."
14091,Leonard,"hey, we’re all going over to the apple store to make fun of the guys at the genius bar. you want to come?"
13896,Leonard,"here you go. oh, you owe me another two dollars. the price of mu-shu pork went up."
12795,Leonard,i’m… uh… at work.
16934,Leonard,i’m serious. i’ll do it.
12227,Leonard,"no, i’m fine. penny’s fine, the guy she’s kissing is really fine and…"
20554,Leonard,"of course, we can split any profits three ways."
12167,Leonard,"yeah, he didn’t tell it right."
19870,Leonard,i guess not.
12360,Leonard,and orcs!
14077,Leonard,"okay, first of all, penny, thank you for coming."
13743,Leonard,"uh, y-yeah."
14933,Leonard,"come on, howard, bernadette, you’re both scientists. help me out here."
17249,Leonard,what are you going to do when you get to the university? people are going to recognize you.
19812,Leonard,"okay, fine. sheldon, may i please visit your fort?"
18923,Leonard,"huh, well, i think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter."
18270,Leonard,that is not fair. i complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
18994,Leonard,poor mrs. wolowitz.
17784,Leonard,"my dad was an anthropologist. the only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an etruscan boy. i hated that kid."
14873,Leonard,"i know. and those specials, they change every day."
16176,Leonard,i think so.
16156,Leonard,"face it, raj, we crashed and burned tonight."
15114,Leonard,what’s going on?
15110,Leonard,oh!
14336,Leonard,good one.
21558,Leonard,"he just made her laugh, something’s wrong."
16577,Leonard,what?
20660,Leonard,thank you.
12477,Leonard,i think we’re all talking to penny here.
19261,Leonard,huh. what is this?
15521,Leonard,yes.
17000,Leonard,"it’s this jimmy speckerman thing. i can’t decide if i should agree to see him or not. of course that might be because the last time i ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces."
12645,Leonard,"ah. technically yes, but, if you’ll notice, it’s reversible. so it works as two. "
12822,Leonard,i don’t think penny’s ever coming here again. 
15261,Leonard,wesley crusher was wil wheaton’s character on star trek.
16856,Leonard,"oh, my god, you are amazing. i mean, i don’t deserve you. wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?"
13641,Leonard,she stuck a needle into my hand!
13045,Leonard,"excuse me, this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s sister."
19249,Leonard,no.
21430,Leonard,"well, what am i supposed to say, stop having fun without me?"
15191,Leonard,it’s in a fedex box on its way back to where it came from.
12817,Leonard,hi!
16944,Leonard,"hey, pal. you didn’t see me telling kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter."
16211,Leonard,no.
17450,Leonard,"well, if it makes you feel any better, i screwed things up pretty good with penny."
13121,Leonard,"i don’t care. she’s upset, i’m going over there. "
13616,Leonard,"oh, clearly i could have."
19575,Leonard,really? what’d they say?
15652,Leonard,does it have melon on it?
13698,Leonard,"yeah, i could say something like that to her. i’ll go do that. thank you."
21238,Leonard,does it really need to say that?
13929,Leonard,– come on. it’ll be fun.
20574,Leonard,i’ll show you how to do one.
13385,Leonard,a griffin?
19170,Leonard,are you mad at me?
13217,Leonard,this could work. 
18409,Leonard,it’s fine. and also not true.
19639,Leonard,i’m in love. let’s do something else.
14708,Leonard,"oh, you’re kidding me."
18053,Leonard,"got it. all right, i’m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. like s. smith instead of samantha smith."
19240,Leonard,i’m sure mrs. florida’s walking funny. can we get back to work?
13511,Leonard,"yeah, yeah. uh, see, here’s the thing, after you leave, i still have to live with him."
20066,Leonard,"no, we just made out."
20741,Leonard,morning.
18796,Leonard,"oh, hang on. check your in-box."
20500,Leonard,i really do.
12718,Leonard,"i don’t get it, i already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?"
13739,Leonard,"i have two words for you. the first is big, the other’s whoop."
16833,Leonard,now we’re getting somewhere.
21350,Leonard,"hang, hang on. so i have to bring penny, you can’t afford it, howard’s gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time."
14528,Leonard,excuse me.
16836,Leonard,"hey, well, see you. i’m going out. "
20073,Leonard,"i mean, she’s really beautiful. she could have any guy she wants. which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me."
12509,Leonard,great idea.
21393,Leonard,do not adjust the dosage. you nailed it.
15041,Leonard,double guacamole?
20948,Leonard,"hey, she didn’t compromise. she settled. there’s a difference."
14562,Leonard,what could she possibly be talking about for so long?
12674,Leonard,"it wasn’t, it was not, you are a nutcase."
18373,Leonard,"well, whenever i talk about how awful my mom was, penny will do anything to make me feel better."
15927,Leonard,"she introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face."
12207,Leonard,"oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?"
14648,Leonard,"oh. football, sure."
17353,Leonard,"sure, what’s up?"
15274,Leonard,"hey, where you been?"
19907,Leonard,we did not. that’s not true. can i speak to you alone for a second?
20503,Leonard,i’d enjoy that.
12281,Leonard,what?
21160,Leonard,yeah. let me finish packing this stuff up. you know how sheldon is if he sees christmas stuff lying around after new year’s.
20220,Leonard,"no, nothing. we just changed our mind."
13181,Leonard,there was a draft.
15199,Leonard,"hey, you didn’t want a slurpee at 7-eleven, you don’t get glasses."
21275,Leonard,"and, sorry about the suitcase."
17633,Leonard,"so, basically, this is what’s called mag-lev technology. it uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. here, you hold this."
17472,Leonard,where’d you get a beer?
14551,Leonard,why are you carrying extras?
17423,Leonard,"all right, let me rephrase the question. why are you wearing long underwear?"
17590,Leonard,penny got it.
19011,Leonard,"come on, be serious."
18537,Leonard,i just don’t understand why you invited him here today.
17666,Leonard,"sheldon, i wasn’t done talking. she hands in the paper tomorrow. i know i could help her. and she’s my girlfriend. i, i should be allowed to help her. why aren’t i allowed to help her?"
17086,Leonard,"so, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?"
19222,Leonard,"okay, let’s focus. the girls are gone, we have 48 hours. there are no distractions. let’s change the world."
13328,Leonard,hello.
17855,Leonard,at least i know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.
13464,Leonard,why? what are they doing?
15052,Leonard,who’s miserable and alone?
12142,Leonard,"excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that superman’s flight is a feat of strength."
17110,Leonard,"okay, but earlier it seemed like…"
15358,Leonard,"i did, but it’s been a while, and i wanted to sound smart over breakfast."
14631,Leonard,"okay. speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, i made a pact with wolowitz that kind of involves you."
19443,Leonard,sure. if the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker.
17717,Leonard,i hate this guy.
13680,Leonard,we’re not living together.
12076,Leonard,"that’s not true, remember at thanksgiving my grandmother with alzheimer’s had that episode."
14848,Leonard,you do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
18234,Leonard,"well, flush sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one."
15024,Leonard,"yeah, well, he’s extra special. hey, shelly. what you doing?"
18399,Leonard,doesn’t matter.
16764,Leonard,"sheldon, she just got off the plane. she doesn’t want to cook."
13888,Leonard,do i have to?
12230,Leonard,yeah. he was kinda dreamy.
14959,Leonard,what if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
14226,Leonard,"i think we’re fine, stuart."
16748,Leonard,i’m going to a party. i’m not turning r2-d2 and c-3po over to the empire!
13940,Leonard,"okay, is everyone clear on the plan?"
15777,Leonard,really? you’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? you know what happens when you yawn in public.
19793,Leonard,from a kevin smith movie?
21592,Leonard,i’m at work. 
12978,Leonard,are you okay?
20323,Leonard,come on. i take care of him all day long. you do it for once.
12326,Leonard,"well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
20362,Leonard,"well, did you try wearing the shirt i said was inappropriate for work?"
15088,Leonard,you seen sheldon?
19572,Leonard,is your tongue blue?
12525,Leonard,"i’m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?"
15234,Leonard,"yeah, probably."
18838,Leonard,so humiliating? am i driving you to the cheesecake factory…? i’m sorry. i’ll. i’ll stop. i’ll stop.
14099,Leonard,"oh, look, now he’s boring on an international scale."
13361,Leonard,"well, uh, no i… the… no."
20459,Leonard,"it’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?"
16592,Leonard,do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
18576,Leonard,is someone sick?
17623,Leonard,"very good. and then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. "
20711,Leonard,"all right, here goes nothing."
16498,Leonard,thank you. befuddled. the word i was looking for was befuddled.
17035,Leonard,"no, no, no, come on in. i’ll make you a cup of coffee."
14421,Leonard,not exactly. but she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
14584,Leonard,yeah.
15765,Leonard,i guess he just hates fun.
20854,Leonard,that’s the definition of being a know-it-all.
13960,Leonard,penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and i have indelible ink on my forehead!
19129,Leonard,"well, that’s not your fault."
13962,Leonard,can’t we just postpone it till the spring? maybe next summer?
17090,Leonard,"oh, sorry, yeah. awkward."
18343,Leonard,"there, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. you know what? do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it."
19052,Leonard,"no, i did not."
19700,Leonard,oh.
19345,Leonard,what?
17660,Leonard,"penny started taking a class. she wrote a paper, she didn’t want me to read it, i went behind her back and i read it anyway."
12300,Leonard,"well, chafing, right?"
17224,Leonard,"s’mores, huh? good for you."
14784,Leonard,no. that was the last pudding cup.
15515,Leonard,"you have any ideas, raj?"
16509,Leonard,here we go.
16154,Leonard,coffee maker?
16704,Leonard,"now that howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you."
14718,Leonard,"so by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?"
17477,Leonard,that’s so cool.
17947,Leonard,that was a huge spoiler.
15056,Leonard,that’s not what i was going to tell you.
19837,Leonard,"all right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple."
17548,Leonard,"mmm, doesn’t matter. half the time, he just ends up playing with the box."
17382,Leonard,really?
15789,Leonard,"well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, i’m older. look, no more superhero bedsheets."
14280,Leonard,"come on, let’s go."
13099,Leonard,"alright, i’ll be right back. "
14818,Leonard,"okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance."
20965,Leonard,of course you do.
13086,Leonard,seen it.
12218,Leonard,the bastard teleported. 
15454,Leonard,"don’t worry about the moon. we, we set our laser to stun."
12459,Leonard,"no, you’re coming with me."
15909,Leonard,short round?
19712,Leonard,he always needs all the attention. he’s such a baby.
20524,Leonard,"i’m sold, you’re ahead of bale."
12780,Leonard,they texted me. 
21496,Leonard,"yeah, i guess."
19280,Leonard,"i want you to know i get why you don’t want the money, you’ve got this new job, you’re excited about being financially independent, and i am nothing but proud of you."
12417,Leonard,"well, how did you know about it?"
20797,Leonard,"hey, we’re here."
12860,Leonard,what?
15792,Leonard,what?
19178,Leonard,"no, no, no, i don’t want to."
14021,Leonard,you don’t have to. ever.
17523,Leonard,what are you doing?
13032,Leonard,"if the wedding’s not until tomorrow, why don’t you stay with us tonight? "
20504,Leonard,"i’m telling you, you got this."
14979,Leonard,just keep walking. 
21312,Leonard,no.
18442,Leonard,that’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
13165,Leonard,right.
16666,Leonard,you okay?
16620,Leonard,a hobby?
14106,Leonard,"you know, i’ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at i can’t score with. i think i’ll let you two take this one."
12689,Leonard,"oh, congratulations, what a lucky break."
14793,Leonard,i feel like we’re forgetting something important.
21553,Leonard,he doesn’t; he just likes looking at them. bring a book.
21328,Leonard,what’s going on with your dad?
17678,Leonard,"no, i, i mean, it was good. there were just a few things that needed a little polishing."
16947,Leonard,"maybe i’m not done hanging out with…  you’re right, it’s getting late."
14355,Leonard,"‘cause he’s upset over his situation with penny and if i have to hear about it again, i’m going to kick him in his ovaries."
21038,Leonard,you guys might want to start eating. but you won’t be living here.
14466,Leonard,"man, i can not catch a break."
17085,Leonard,see you later.
14964,Leonard,how is that going to help them?
14798,Leonard,"never mind, what’s your announcement?"
17015,Leonard,right.
19239,Leonard,"so, i’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there’s a way we could use maglev technology."
17664,Leonard,"he’s probably busy. you’re worried about nothing. give it a couple more days. i’m sure he’ll play, and you’ll see that everything’s fine. my turn. i can’t let penny hand in a bad paper, but how do i tell her it’s bad without letting her know that i read it?"
17186,Leonard,"so, i’ve got a gunshot wound. that’s pretty badass."
17526,Leonard,okay.
20593,Leonard,who are you texting?
12663,Leonard,any other questions?
19826,Leonard,"mmm, they’re alpha males."
12385,Leonard,penny? what about her?
21095,Leonard,"well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma."
21584,Leonard,you have a drink that’ll make him less obnoxious?
16362,Leonard,"oh, wait. hang on. are you upset?"
21515,Leonard,so you think it’s okay?
12819,Leonard,no! 
17409,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
12015,Leonard,"i don’t know, i’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before."
14660,Leonard,"oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?"
21081,Leonard,then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.
20306,Leonard,"well, you didn’t read it right. the new star wars is coming. gah."
17635,Leonard,a grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. now watch this.
15809,Leonard,what are you talking about?
21548,Leonard,should we give them their privacy?
20745,Leonard,who are these people?
12136,Leonard,yes.
20931,Leonard,"that’s it. it’s sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night."
16247,Leonard,hi.
19330,Leonard,"next game, let’s switch helmets."
13174,Leonard,good.  
12354,Leonard,"this is ridiculous. dammit, sheldon, snap out of it. you’re a physicist, you belong at the university doing research, not hiding in your room. "
18657,Leonard,"no, you’re not."
17555,Leonard,you talk to howard lately?
18872,Leonard,why did i pee before i decided to move in here?
15467,Leonard,"okay, yeah, he’s stupid."
17752,Leonard,you know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.
18499,Leonard,or it’s resolved.
19233,Leonard,"okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. that’s when he altered the timeline."
13073,Leonard,oh. alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.
12823,Leonard,"yeah, so?"
16431,Leonard,"oh, i’d wait."
14585,Leonard,"wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? because we should file a complaint."
12969,Leonard,"uh, just give us a few minutes."
14199,Leonard,"alicia, what do you want as your default setting for dvds, 5.1 dolby or dts?"
17415,Leonard,i totally had sex in the ocean.
21004,Leonard,she makes more money than i do.
20518,Leonard,"or a real batman. hey, stuart? didn’t you try to get adam west to do a signing here once?"
14439,Leonard,check.
17373,Leonard,"okay, that i believe."
15801,Leonard,use your best judgement.
20629,Leonard,"i don’t, i know, but this isn’t a big deal. it’s just a little savings i put aside."
18097,Leonard,"i was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again."
17892,Leonard,"yeah, that sounds fun."
20559,Leonard,what?
14927,Leonard,you’re surprised? your psychic didn’t tell you i was going to be a jerk?
21675,Leonard,"i’m sorry alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. i’m sorry alex hit on me, i’d no idea i’m cute."
20691,Leonard,"you know, you don’t need to use sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement."
18502,Leonard,"oh, i don’t know. who cares? look at me."
18772,Leonard,"they’ve been in there, like, half an hour."
12494,Leonard,yes you are. 
20396,Leonard,"well, you know, penny and i have been talking about taking a weekend in vegas. maybe we should all go."
18285,Leonard,"you know what? i’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying."
19521,Leonard,"i don’t want to talk about it. there, the place is all yours."
21581,Leonard,"you can stare at your board all day sheldon, she’s still going to be right. "
13329,Leonard,hi tom. sheldon? didn’t i explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
20846,Leonard,what’s up?
16532,Leonard,i wasn’t swinging around a pole.
17841,Leonard,i didn’t steal anyone.
18356,Leonard,mm-hmm. and?
14030,Leonard,thank you.
15685,Leonard,"oh, right. that."
14192,Leonard,you’re making her uncomfortable.
21640,Leonard,"first of all, the projects were totally different. i was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn’t hear me. if you’d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, i’d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me."
21619,Leonard,"hey, guys!"
15948,Leonard,don’t i know it.
15119,Leonard,"hey, stuart, what’s going on?"
16279,Leonard,sorry! oop!
12847,Leonard,great.
21008,Leonard,"yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay."
21009,Leonard,so their plan for saving the earth from armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?
18086,Leonard,"when you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution."
19325,Leonard,"yeah, sure. you owe me."
18864,Leonard,it was. by terminator.
21521,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, you’re, you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it’s fine, i’ll just, i’ll suck it up."
15902,Leonard,"nice going, raj, just got him down for his nap."
15961,Leonard,"oh, b-be careful. give him some line. okay, now reel him in."
20746,Leonard,what are you guys doing?
19671,Leonard,"i thought it’d be a little more, just more."
14709,Leonard,nice meeting all of you.
14832,Leonard,that’s where sheldon sits.
13092,Leonard,what’s the matter?
13918,Leonard,what?
12353,Leonard,"no, we’re not, we’re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends."
15476,Leonard,"okay, i’ll walk down with you. so, last night was fun, huh?"
21564,Leonard,"no offence, stuart, but the woman’s a doctor."
17120,Leonard,and we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.
18444,Leonard,"oh, yeah."
17574,Leonard,"ah, it was all right, i guess. got to heimlich a cherry stem out of sheldon. caught raj right in the eye."
13263,Leonard,sounds fun.
21453,Leonard,"i don’t know, we came home from work and we found you."
20755,Leonard,seriously?
20901,Leonard,is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
20860,Leonard,i’m getting enraged.
13456,Leonard,don’t.
21087,Leonard,then yeah.
17301,Leonard,"so, what kind of things are they…  will you stop that?"
13433,Leonard,"no, he lives here now."
16980,Leonard,"sheldon, why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?"
15711,Leonard,no.
18015,Leonard,"oh, i’m not. it’s about you."
19580,Leonard,"uh, don’t lower yourself to their level."
13640,Leonard,"i did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery."
20063,Leonard,"uh, do you mind if i sit?"
12942,Leonard,"my physics bowl trophy!  “leonard is so smart, sheldon who?”"
15469,Leonard,where are we going?
13214,Leonard,"i didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane."
12205,Leonard,and control it how?
21437,Leonard,thank you. i just feel…
12301,Leonard,"of course, yeah, emotional chafing. hey, do you want to see something cool?  i can make this olive go into this glass without touching it. "
12882,Leonard,"you’re kidding, why not?"
19813,Leonard,thank you.
14414,Leonard,bye.
16467,Leonard,"they’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?"
17521,Leonard,"sheldon, you are not in charge."
21233,Leonard,i don’t understand what you want.
16387,Leonard,does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
13548,Leonard,howard’s at the mars rover lab. he says he’s in trouble. defcon 5.
19758,Leonard,"uh, i’m just gonna tell you the truth."
16217,Leonard,i just want to talk to her.
20187,Leonard,then i’m going to tell him we’re in.
21049,Leonard,"no, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want."
18850,Leonard,"come on, guys. raj put a lot of effort into this. and that’s great. it’s not sad, it’s great."
13248,Leonard,"uh, what about that girl last year at comic-con?"
17905,Leonard,can i use your phone? our car got stolen.
14875,Leonard,um…
14307,Leonard,what about it?
16512,Leonard,you all right?
13740,Leonard,did not.
19726,Leonard,"oh, i like to laugh. but say it anyway."
15776,Leonard,"well then, bed mister."
15414,Leonard,"no, i didn’t just move in. first we had to iron out a few details. "
20469,Leonard,are you actually gonna dance?
14010,Leonard,uh-huh.
15059,Leonard,"in any case, they’re asking me to fill in for him."
17244,Leonard,told ya.
16796,Leonard,"thanks. you, too. you know, go ahead and take it."
17205,Leonard,"i don’t know what that is, but if it means i can go home and sleep, then yes."
18767,Leonard,really? do you know how much those lakers tickets were?
13757,Leonard,"i had no idea it was so heavy. the thing just fell right over on me, didn’t it?"
14034,Leonard,you and leslie?
18674,Leonard,that’s it? you’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
15978,Leonard,"it is. you just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person i see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death."
18427,Leonard,"hey, i get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. we’re really proud of you."
16224,Leonard,"i thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie."
19601,Leonard,"yeah, okay, i’m good."
18662,Leonard,"look, you know i love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost."
13292,Leonard,thank you.
14163,Leonard,don’t yell at me. i’m not manufacturing. i’m just web design.
14372,Leonard,"then what was oh, boy?"
18987,Leonard,"really? because i just heard will you marry me? that’s two proposals, one day. sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name hofstadter."
13260,Leonard,"really, what changed?"
19448,Leonard,"fine, put the slim jim in the garbage bag."
18392,Leonard,hey.
15940,Leonard,"hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? cause i’m good with that."
13012,Leonard,"sheldon, get out of my way."
15083,Leonard,what do you think? 
15769,Leonard,you’ve really got to get out more.
12772,Leonard,i’m going back to bed. 
18661,Leonard,um…
21755,Leonard,what do you want? i didn’t say come in!
15376,Leonard,"penny, i can still drive you."
15431,Leonard,"oh, uh, clear nail polish. i had a mani-pedi. men can get those. anyway, i may owe you an apology."
18881,Leonard,"just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?"
13234,Leonard,that doesn’t matter to me at all.
21314,Leonard,just look at the board.
17401,Leonard,"oh, i will. there is no telling what might happen."
12754,Leonard,"gee, why wouldn’t i?"
17780,Leonard,no.
14164,Leonard,what are you doing?
20017,Leonard,"oh, no. no, come on. i have a friend in you. you said so."
16530,Leonard,"well, you know, the way i took my clothes off."
14214,Leonard,"sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight."
12939,Leonard,"sorry, somebody’s sitting there."
14461,Leonard,so much for our friendship with sheldon.
21770,Leonard,we can fix that. let’s leave.
21470,Leonard,is that it?
15164,Leonard,"we are not blackmailing peter j… all right, where’s the ring?"
21209,Leonard,"well, hey, come on, just tell me."
17558,Leonard,"ah, congratulations and may god have mercy on your soul. i’m leonard. this is raj."
18404,Leonard,it’s really sweet what howard wants to do for bernadette.
15673,Leonard,"yeah, and don’t you forget it."
17989,Leonard,"hey, you coming to lunch?"
21493,Leonard,"oh, the video game. yeah, that was bad."
17152,Leonard,"hang on. penny, do you have plans for dinner?"
12347,Leonard,oh. 
13251,Leonard,"yes i have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone."
20716,Leonard,i mostly just smell my nasal spray.
13556,Leonard,"just said howard’s a terrific guy. he’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much."
12630,Leonard,"they don’t, that’s why i saved this one. "
15916,Leonard,he’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after the thing?
21224,Leonard,i really don’t know.
17394,Leonard,"no, he didn’t."
14685,Leonard,i really appreciate this.
12439,Leonard,"okay, how about this, nobody gets to be the flash, we all change, agreed?"
14804,Leonard,"excuse me, i’m sitting here."
16965,Leonard,"all right, but just for the record, i checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it."
17078,Leonard,"not like a date, a date."
14619,Leonard,but you have a whole bunch of ’em.
13096,Leonard,"alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys."
19499,Leonard,"sheldon, do you realize i don’t live with the woman i love because of you? no other reason. just you."
12624,Leonard,so the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
17723,Leonard,this is silly. i have nothing to worry about.
16869,Leonard,i don’t think amy was eaten by a bobcat.
17601,Leonard,i know what he looks like.
12539,Leonard,"penny, you’re always welcome to stay with us."
14896,Leonard,"you’re right. i’m-i’m-i’m-i’m sorry, i’m way out of line!"
21401,Leonard,"well, now that you point it out…"
19022,Leonard,all right.
21030,Leonard,"mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?"
21741,Leonard,"oh, good. i passed the barriers."
14358,Leonard,"i think i gave you bad advice about penny, and i want to apologize."
19592,Leonard,are you crazy? you don’t know who this person is. delete that.
19520,Leonard,"ooh, and one time when you were asleep, amy totally took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever."
16644,Leonard,why don’t you just give me five minutes? i’ll google how to do this. i’ll call you right back.
13632,Leonard,by making constipated moose sounds?
21528,Leonard,"hmm. i don’t care if this thing is burning out my retinas, it makes me feel special. now, before we field test, i think we…"
13989,Leonard,that was fast.
17060,Leonard,you know digital alcohol is never a solution. what’s going on?
13660,Leonard,"no, you’re not."
20286,Leonard,"well, what is it?"
20054,Leonard,"fine, you want to meet her?"
17544,Leonard,you okay? you seem a little distracted.
13651,Leonard,are you insane? now she’s going to think i’m desperate. you’ve destroyed this relationship! and you want to know what the worst part is? you don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
19367,Leonard,there’s no music.
21358,Leonard,"yeah, if you want us to look like losers."
16141,Leonard,"hang on. hang on. uh-huh. okay, thank you. howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. he’s in critical condition."
15599,Leonard,sure.
16795,Leonard,leonard.
12103,Leonard,"come on, you know how it is with break-ups."
19607,Leonard,"hi, we’re here to pick up an order for comic center."
12879,Leonard,"still, i’d like to know the details. his mother was human, his father was vulcan, they couldn’t just conceive."
18921,Leonard,it’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story.
14310,Leonard,nobody wants that.
15988,Leonard,fellas. it’s been 30 minutes. nobody’s touched each other.
16493,Leonard,you’re kidding. 3-d?
21359,Leonard,"yeah, of course, why?"
13188,Leonard,"what are you talking about, the date went fine. "
17781,Leonard,"i’m no expert, but i think the hook has to go through the worm."
18667,Leonard,no.
14454,Leonard,"what? uh, he’ll be fine, the guy’s a trouper, come here."
15716,Leonard,"well, you know how you’re always saying that amy is a girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?"
20340,Leonard,"yeah, me, too."
15778,Leonard,"you don’t want that, do you?"
17708,Leonard,"oh, great. we’re still dating, right?"
13805,Leonard,wow.
18217,Leonard,what do you think?
16599,Leonard,got any advice?
16092,Leonard,thanks.
13011,Leonard,"sorry raj, my mind is made up."
19030,Leonard,"hey, buddy."
14963,Leonard,would i be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
14291,Leonard,"i don’t know, howard isn’t really the family fun kind of guy."
16629,Leonard,"not easy, but we’re making it work."
21197,Leonard,"damn. i burped so hard, i died in my game."
15919,Leonard,yeah.
18808,Leonard,"she’s right, a committee that important should meet more often."
15774,Leonard,"give me a minute. sheldon,"
17215,Leonard,absolutely. if you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man who’s incapable of functioning on his own.
17990,Leonard,what you looking at?
18623,Leonard,it’s a joke.
18391,Leonard,"so, boys, how was the pyjama party? you guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?"
18001,Leonard,what?
17758,Leonard,"all right, you brought this on yourself. sheldon, get him."
21460,Leonard,ask him.
19234,Leonard,wait. is brought right?
17985,Leonard,"oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have thursday night off?"
19102,Leonard,"yeah, he’s fine, he’s just a little rattled."
20853,Leonard,"you’re not a lawyer, sheldon, you’re just a know-it-all."
16495,Leonard,no.
17117,Leonard,what if i dump you?
19286,Leonard,thanks again for having us.
19306,Leonard,i think so.
20094,Leonard,"so, are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?"
17944,Leonard,ow!
13980,Leonard,maybe something less personal.
16013,Leonard,zack?
14936,Leonard,what’s going on?
12058,Leonard,i’m sorry.
18539,Leonard,sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.
14822,Leonard,"i gotta say, i am really impressed. this is truly the sheldon cooper way to get even. "
21335,Leonard,"hey, you guys let stuart live with you. why not raj, too?"
12156,Leonard,"well they don’t. hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content."
13746,Leonard,"congratulations on the macarthur grant, by the way. big fan."
18703,Leonard,"oh, how’s it going? you taking hollywood by storm?"
14568,Leonard,you’re not changing how penny laughs.
16451,Leonard,"sheldon, i’m not alone in here."
17528,Leonard,i wish there were more.
17049,Leonard,"no, you’re done. i want you out of my apartment right now."
21051,Leonard,"just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell penny."
12517,Leonard,"she’s gone, sheldon. "
19199,Leonard,"uh, do you know how penny told raj he should have left her off his list?"
12052,Leonard,here we go.
18083,Leonard,"hey, uh, listen, everybody. before howard gets here, et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father."
18370,Leonard,"i’ll try, but i might be sad again tonight."
12224,Leonard,"uh, yeah, uh, i just, i got your mail again, here."
15293,Leonard,"i do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. and she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces."
15772,Leonard,"if the past is any indication, no."
14518,Leonard,why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
17435,Leonard,"oh, great."
19659,Leonard,why a turtle?
19986,Leonard,no.
19910,Leonard,"yes, and we’ll get back to that. but, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. you’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers."
12429,Leonard,"you hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”"
15737,Leonard,you changed the address on the building? what about mail?
15213,Leonard,how did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
16249,Leonard,what you doing?
18432,Leonard,"oh, rose petals."
20646,Leonard,but what if man-man dressed as a bat?
18094,Leonard,"well, one of them is."
12403,Leonard,you don’t believe in luck.
17939,Leonard,is my coitus whimsically inventive?
12085,Leonard,this is not a good time.
15835,Leonard,as a matter of fact i.. i… i can’t… i can’t… i can’t do it.
18908,Leonard,"that doesn’t work any more. he just thinks i’m taking him to the doctor. so, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?"
19019,Leonard,oh. then i guess i’m in.
18555,Leonard,"i, i don’t understand. all you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. i was trying to make you happy."
15970,Leonard,excuse me?
14112,Leonard,"okay, sheldon, i’m going to say why and your answer cannot be because i forgot my flash drive."
19460,Leonard,okay. mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
13899,Leonard,"it’s, whatever. ten, eleven dollars."
20851,Leonard,are you crazy? you can’t put that on snapchat.
20000,Leonard,you know what? it’s fine.
12023,Leonard,significant improvement over the old neighbour.
14878,Leonard,"i drove, mother. i’m driving now."
16409,Leonard,"mm, i don’t know. i get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it’s just easier to stand behind the tape."
14561,Leonard,"yes, you’re forbidden."
12881,Leonard,i’ll take a look at it. 
21737,Leonard,"well, can’t you drive?"
19421,Leonard,i still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.
15715,Leonard,yeah. so?
18075,Leonard,yeah. although…
16584,Leonard,"they slept together, sherlock."
13690,Leonard,"oh, good. do you have any fabric softener?"
18939,Leonard,thankfully penny and i have a relationship based on honesty. what? i don’t lie to her.
15380,Leonard,you still have a cold?
21769,Leonard,but i said no to that.
13297,Leonard,i guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.
20694,Leonard,that’s different. i’m like the little girl in poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the tv.
12513,Leonard,"you know, penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of halo tournaments sometime."
17492,Leonard,i know what the anthropic principle is.
14435,Leonard,we’re out of ice.
18766,Leonard,no. maybe to her.
14160,Leonard,holy crap. someone just ordered a thousand penny blossoms.
12541,Leonard,sheldon you just can’t dictate…
16337,Leonard,and she likes you.
15630,Leonard,yeah.
21752,Leonard,okay.
12199,Leonard,yeah.
19434,Leonard,can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? and here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
19745,Leonard,"we do have time. i mean, we could drive by and just look at it."
19859,Leonard,nope. it’s pretty exciting.
19001,Leonard,you having second thoughts about acting?
12833,Leonard,"no kidding, you speak english really well."
14240,Leonard,"you’re right, i really should be asking strangers on the internet."
18603,Leonard,disagree.
15766,Leonard,"so, uh, priya, what are your plans while you’re here."
18401,Leonard,laser’s warmed up.
18984,Leonard,it’s just such a big decision. i don’t want to have any regrets.
17915,Leonard,"oh, this is neat. think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. it would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. don’t you think?"
14375,Leonard,"yes, how did we live before twitter? i guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning."
17973,Leonard,is that so?
13487,Leonard,"no, no, don’t tell her."
21294,Leonard,this train thing worked out better than i thought. he’s home studying the engineer’s manual.
15847,Leonard,"these are pretty god, what flavour is this?"
21307,Leonard,"it’s classified. if we tell anyone, we’d get in trouble."
19334,Leonard,next level.
15900,Leonard,"oh, i hope they let us in soon. i’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. the guy makes me buy a gatorade every time. it’s a vicious circle."
20657,Leonard,you’re the only one who eats them.
15690,Leonard,that sounds lovely.
21450,Leonard,"oh, my god, it’s seven."
15817,Leonard,"because, well, batman has the secret."
19861,Leonard,i’ll take my chances.
20917,Leonard,it’s only for five weeks.
16752,Leonard,"no, i just got a text from stuart. brent spiner is at the party."
21671,Leonard,you’re a mean one mr. grinch.
12382,Leonard,you mean my cello?
15821,Leonard,what do you want.
19531,Leonard,"that is a tough one. uh, i know he brushes both of them."
17149,Leonard,every scenario i play out for you and me ends badly.
15075,Leonard,"sheldon, we’ve been through this. i’m taking penny."
13900,Leonard,"fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one. "
15495,Leonard,thirty feet.
18839,Leonard,"come on, don’t look so sad. you never know what’s gonna happen. maybe tonight will be great."
19672,Leonard,"maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad."
19074,Leonard,yeah.
18139,Leonard,"yeah. uh, maybe we were hacked. you know, the chinese have been hacking everything lately."
16285,Leonard,"oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? that is so cruel."
18345,Leonard,why are you reading pride and prejudice?
17470,Leonard,that’s so great. 
21690,Leonard,"it was l. frank baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, i’m boring myself. sorry, i can’t see any of your faces right now, but i bet they look like this. uh, you know, i, i wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but i hated it. maybe high school’s great if you look like this, but i didn’t even feel like i existed at that school. and now that i think about it, i bet a lot of you feel the same way. so, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. uh, maybe you never fit in. or maybe you’re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. maybe you’re graduating and you still haven’t had your first kiss. by the way, 19, and geraldine coco, wherever you are, thank you. maybe you don’t have any friends. and guess what? that’s okay. while all the popular kids are off doing whatever, i don’t know what they were doing ’cause i was never there."
12757,Leonard,o-o-o-o-h! again?
17318,Leonard,"oh, hi, penny, guess what? sheldon got bongos."
20653,Leonard,your attendance implies it’s not.
16648,Leonard,"taking shorts off. there we go. naked, naked, naked!"
18402,Leonard,"no, no, what are you doing? he’s both happy and quiet. it’s like seeing a unicorn and bigfoot at the same time."
20127,Leonard,"no, of course not. i just feel bad."
19777,Leonard,"i was gonna say or, but why bother?"
13718,Leonard,"not specifically, but, uh, i did tell her that i had feelings."
20400,Leonard,"so, the guys and i were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to vegas."
18049,Leonard,"oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?"
19786,Leonard,it really is.
18179,Leonard,what?
20142,Leonard,"it’s indoors, so no sunscreen."
17305,Leonard,"like i said, complicated game."
12958,Leonard,snipe. 
14102,Leonard,thank you.
18648,Leonard,"that was really crappy of me. what you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and i really do believe you could be one of them."
20348,Leonard,well…
13210,Leonard,"it’s not you, howard, he says he’s moving out. "
13515,Leonard,"are you insane? you’re not going to party with them, you’re not even going to get anywhere near that place."
12982,Leonard,so?
20993,Leonard,no. she cannot kiss. what is wrong with you people?
21432,Leonard,"you know, it’s nice to spend time with people who don’t talk about work like it’s some kind of soap opera."
15559,Leonard,"greetings, whatever the hell you are."
20904,Leonard,"yes, you can."
14468,Leonard,"of course i’m going to do something. uh, howard, you check the comic book store. raj, go to the thai restaurant. i’ll stay here with penny in her apartment.  oh, damn it. it’s sheldon’s mother. a break cannot be caught. hi, mrs. cooper. he is? sheldon went home to texas. yeah, no, i know he resigned. yes, i guess it kind of is our fault. no, no, no, you, you’re right, someone needs to come talk to him. don’t worry, i’ll take care of it. yeah. all right. new plan. howard, you and raj go to texas. i’ll stay here with penny in her apartment."
14279,Leonard,that is a lot of cologne.
20181,Leonard,how does he get the helium?
18215,Leonard,"well, do you really think i have a shot?"
18474,Leonard,skee-ball tickets?
20884,Leonard,"so, what are you guys gonna do today?"
20047,Leonard,"hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?"
17386,Leonard,what if he doesn’t?
19016,Leonard,"no, no. no, it’s too late. i’m your bran muffin. probably fat-free and good for your colon."
14788,Leonard,okay.
17980,Leonard,‘kay.
14373,Leonard,there’s nothing wrong with the science here.
18553,Leonard,"well, you’re welcome."
17803,Leonard,"yeah, sorry. uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. what do you do? and, howard, do not say, i feel up the large chest."
14210,Leonard,what are you doing?
12634,Leonard,"you see, kandor was the capital city of the planet krypton, it was miniaturised by brainiac before krypton exploded and then rescued by superman. "
13021,Leonard,"on the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the earth ending life as we know it. "
16190,Leonard,really?
14677,Leonard,apparently.
16828,Leonard,"here’s the thing, i, i’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman."
16121,Leonard,"okay, good night."
14040,Leonard,that’s a lot of shoes you ordered.
19201,Leonard,why?
14626,Leonard,are you kidding? i couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.
20891,Leonard,so?
18418,Leonard,good to know.
21116,Leonard,"oh, i knew it, sheldon changed the password."
14538,Leonard,"no, her bed kind of… broke."
17729,Leonard,what?
19905,Leonard,"you still are. uh, mom, hey, tell mary the story about how i made a van der graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner."
19407,Leonard,"that someone was sheldon, and the day was yesterday. hey, look at this. dear roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. love, mom. wow, look at the date. he saved this fifty years and never got to open it."
15834,Leonard,yes.
14785,Leonard,"that’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?"
14137,Leonard,damn it. i slipped.
18757,Leonard,"mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves."
15470,Leonard,"why? i mean, okay."
20779,Leonard,how’d it go with my mother?
19516,Leonard,"okay, we’re headed out, see you later."
16416,Leonard,"wow, that’s hard to believe."
16075,Leonard,"look, i’m still happy to drive you to work. nothing’s changed in that regard. we’re still roommates, we’re still friends."
18846,Leonard,"oh, my god, stuart?"
12334,Leonard,what’s with the fish?
18878,Leonard,"uh, uh, does it at least pay well?"
17365,Leonard,what?
13773,Leonard,maybe i heard you wrong. a lot of words sound like yoga.
14943,Leonard,"do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here."
20300,Leonard,i didn’t even know what it was. i saw it on your nightstand. i picked it up.
14575,Leonard,"we’re watching goonies, gremlins and young sherlock holmes. they were all written by chris columbus."
13098,Leonard,why not?
19558,Leonard,you’re giving me a sticker?
13362,Leonard,now. 
12750,Leonard,"well, that’s leo. hey, um, why don’t you tell me about your showcase last night?"
21114,Leonard,"oh, i do. the, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means i’m happy about it."
19802,Leonard,"wait a minute, you have a guy?"
13526,Leonard,problem with the wifi?
14096,Leonard,why not?
21776,Leonard,there’s no mistake.
17881,Leonard,"hey, hey, hey, hey. this is my comic-con makeup. i love you, but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend."
14886,Leonard,you must be very happy.
16165,Leonard,the only time i eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner.
20910,Leonard,sir.
12265,Leonard,cos it’s not carved in stone.
15614,Leonard,i did.
17805,Leonard,"it’s locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in."
13221,Leonard,why not.
17820,Leonard,"honestly, because i had enough crappy christmases as a kid and i’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now."
18143,Leonard,they did.
21683,Leonard,"don’t worry about it, buddy. okay, bye. that was wil, he’s feeling a lot better. apparently, he’s 12-down in the tv guide crossword puzzle."
13360,Leonard,almost.
21387,Leonard,it’s the least we can do.
16139,Leonard,we might be starting to zero in on your problem.
13440,Leonard,"laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?"
14114,Leonard,so you’ll send him an e-mail when we get back.
21645,Leonard,you’re not even watching!
13480,Leonard,"sheldon, do you see what just happened here?"
13107,Leonard,alright. here we go. my first birthday party. 
20110,Leonard,it’s a bachelor party. lighten up.
17806,Leonard,"glowing letters appear on the chest that read, if squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of svaty vaclav and his victory."
15279,Leonard,"do you want the last dumpling, sheldon?"
18928,Leonard,i’m starting to remember the problem with anything can happen thursdays.
19941,Leonard,fine. i want black-tie.
18794,Leonard,"if you’ll recall, the vogon fleet blew up the earth anyway."
13405,Leonard,"look, i need to get to the laser lab, you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home."
12736,Leonard,"no, we’re not going to long beach."
12612,Leonard,"no, hang on, hang on.  see! "
13204,Leonard,what’s wrong with your face? 
12759,Leonard,hey! 
21644,Leonard,"you know what, go to hell and set their thermostat."
15065,Leonard,"yes, but it’ll be valentine’s day. we can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped alps."
14658,Leonard,how was your football party?
15225,Leonard,it’s already loaded. just hit play.
19772,Leonard,i know.
17025,Leonard,here’s your cocoa.
20632,Leonard,"a couple years, but i just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies."
14427,Leonard,"it’s 7 a.m. i’m sorry it’s early, but we’re leaving soon, and i needed to talk to you."
12165,Leonard,"well, we’ll get out of your hair."
20619,Leonard,right. so all we need is to…
14290,Leonard,you think that’d help?
18246,Leonard,yeah.
19426,Leonard,how come you’re up so late?
15899,Leonard,so i guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner.
19668,Leonard,you’re making fun of me. forget it.
14083,Leonard,where are you going?
20537,Leonard,"yeah, well, don’t be a stranger."
17871,Leonard,i wasn’t screwing around with anyone.
12588,Leonard,"oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition."
12119,Leonard,"and you were right about my motives, i was hoping to establish a relationship with penny that might have some day led to sex."
15039,Leonard,told you.
12184,Leonard,"no, i do not have a sarcasm sign."
19020,Leonard,"not like, i guess i’m in. like i guess, i’m in!"
17058,Leonard,some people go outside and do that.
12821,Leonard,wait! penny! take me with you!  
16990,Leonard,"no, that was a different guy."
21092,Leonard,i’ve always been jealous of how much money raj’s family has.
20926,Leonard,"he startles easily, so, please, no flash photography."
18180,Leonard,where is he?
15134,Leonard,that’s what i’m saying.
18957,Leonard,"anyway, the, the funeral’s on sunday."
12839,Leonard,"come on, dennis, i’ll show you the radiation lab."
19023,Leonard,i’m not sure. just feels a little anticlimactic.
12577,Leonard,i bet you’re right.
17368,Leonard,"you know, you’re right. i mean, it’s from you, i’m never going to sell it. i’m opening it."
12433,Leonard,we’re really more….
15018,Leonard,"it’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. the joker from batman."
15021,Leonard,sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.
20131,Leonard,"i know what you’re doing. you’re trying to get attention so we’ll feel bad for you, but it’s not happening."
18735,Leonard,"mmm, what if we go as the fantastic four, and just tell people that the invisible girl is standing there with us."
15049,Leonard,sheldon took our order.
17518,Leonard,"so, is it everything you hoped it would be?"
21457,Leonard,"well, it’s not across the hall."
12669,Leonard,i didn’t screw it up.
15975,Leonard,really? you waited months for time with that telescope. what happened?
20238,Leonard,when did we get a floor safe?
21736,Leonard,"a car, yeah."
16925,Leonard,"exactly. but this is not a date. so i ask again, would you like anything?"
17642,Leonard,"don’t worry, this is exactly how you look when you’re dancing in clubs."
14592,Leonard,"little bit, yeah."
16879,Leonard,"yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play."
20526,Leonard,"so, mother, i’m surprised you came all this way for sheldon’s birthday."
19651,Leonard,we spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?
15838,Leonard,"look, i admit it, i may have crossed a line here, but come on, raj, your sister is a grown woman. to her, i’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate."
16010,Leonard,don’t.
17616,Leonard,"oh, no, no, no, don’t look in there."
14820,Leonard,"this is brilliant, sheldon. how are we going to deploy it in kripke’s office?"
17084,Leonard,that doesn’t make it true.
16966,Leonard,i am not washed-up.
17698,Leonard,okay. you want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
14180,Leonard,"slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. you don’t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while."
15479,Leonard,"when you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?"
18875,Leonard,aren’t you gonna ask?
15728,Leonard,"it was going well. i was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in safe mode. the manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall."
18734,Leonard,good luck.
20710,Leonard,who’s frank and alicia?
14069,Leonard,"penny, penny, i think i know what to do. sheldon, i have some bad news."
12715,Leonard,your cousin leopold?
16251,Leonard,you’re having people over?
19125,Leonard,the kids are gonna love him.
19555,Leonard,"no one told you to taste them. come on, is, is this good or not?"
21638,Leonard,hey.
21505,Leonard,don’t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?
20576,Leonard,"yeah, perfect."
21149,Leonard,"found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?"
20674,Leonard,"howard, just come in here."
18573,Leonard,"sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me."
13069,Leonard,"hi penny, how’s it going. listen, that guy mike that you were dating, is that still going on?"
12983,Leonard,because i want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
16277,Leonard,"yeah, if i had contacts i would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case."
15362,Leonard,"really? uh, sure doesn’t read that way."
20564,Leonard,"howard, what do you think?"
13525,Leonard,sheldon? i just dropped him off at the comic book store. why?
18628,Leonard,are you set on people laughing with you? ‘cause if you’re cool with at you…
19902,Leonard,"that’s so sweet, you think i have self-esteem."
13030,Leonard,excuse me?
19623,Leonard,so you guys were testing us both? what is the matter with you?
14349,Leonard,morning.
14666,Leonard,"okay, some of my facebook friends aren’t geniuses. my point is, if we’re going to be a couple, i should be friends with your friends."
12893,Leonard,"oh, uh, he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. he only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice."
15322,Leonard,all right. but let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. i don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
18591,Leonard,you guys are making me nervous.
16737,Leonard,can you or can’t you?
15730,Leonard,"no, i just, i want what you have. you know, i want a woman in my life."
14502,Leonard,"no, look, mumbai palace."
14976,Leonard,"he’s right, penny. it’s all there."
12153,Leonard,you okay?
17108,Leonard,what does she want from me now?  what’s up?
16732,Leonard,"no, it’s okay. i’m gonna stab my friend in the chest."
21439,Leonard,thank you. i…
19678,Leonard,"well, we did it."
15201,Leonard,"what, to you, is a large crowd?"
13257,Leonard,where did you hear that?
14929,Leonard,"i’m sorry, but facts are facts."
17593,Leonard,"i don’t know, uh, casper the alcoholic ghost?"
18258,Leonard,"is it? hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the morning!"
15696,Leonard,what?
18600,Leonard,"oh, hold on."
19071,Leonard,"it’s dark out and he’s alone, i don’t like it. let’s go get him."
18778,Leonard,"oh, hey. you’re back. how was your trip?"
18416,Leonard,"if by cool you mean willing to, yes. if by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello."
19666,Leonard,"okay, uh, well, i hope it’s fun. i mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic."
18954,Leonard,i just read online that arthur jeffries passed away.
20954,Leonard,"i prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but i still need to get all my pants hemmed."
17643,Leonard,"that’s really nice, sheldon, i’m happy for you."
18177,Leonard,no.
19484,Leonard,that’s what i was doing.
16608,Leonard,"i’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, captain sheldon cooper."
13354,Leonard,sheldon.
17489,Leonard,"you know, it’s not exactly glamorous up there. the water that the astronauts drink is made from each other’s recycled urine."
19707,Leonard,why did he think you’re the lead scientist? it was my idea.
21483,Leonard,you don’t have to go. you’re welcome to hang with us.
16611,Leonard,"penny, penny, listen, i hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me, because i have a girlfriend, and you’re a single woman."
12488,Leonard,hi penny.
19358,Leonard,"he’s right, i was thinking of the lower flermin."
16688,Leonard,"once again, i, i’m really not much of a dancer."
15735,Leonard,the old unabomber approach. kudos.
13462,Leonard,wait for me.
17228,Leonard,"fine. but mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over."
14605,Leonard,"okay, well, then i’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. that’s right, i did it. i cut ’em."
19794,Leonard,i’m just trying to protect you. how many times did i see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
15145,Leonard,why do i always have to carry the heavy stuff?
12712,Leonard,"you told her i lied, why would you tell her i lied?"
12431,Leonard,a party? 
16025,Leonard,hey.
15232,Leonard,yeah.
12746,Leonard,"oh, god! sheldon does not have a cousin leo."
13017,Leonard,"thanks. hey, do you want to, i don’t know, later…"
17422,Leonard,do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear?
12437,Leonard,"oh, no. "
17099,Leonard,you said always. you’ll always have feelings for me.
14313,Leonard,or nobody calls anyone.
21194,Leonard,"well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead i’m gonna keep it to myself."
13222,Leonard,you promised penny what? 
16179,Leonard,"well, n-no, hold on a second, i’m not going to sleep with her."
17532,Leonard,"the guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires."
13944,Leonard,"i don’t really go by lenny, but that’s okay. um, you remember sheldon, howard and raj."
14651,Leonard,"well, this sucks."
21100,Leonard,"yes, you do."
20122,Leonard,you’re right. but what? mexican? italian? german? indian? greek? cuban? chinese? pizza? barbecue? korean? korean barbecue?
18598,Leonard,"you know, maybe you and i wouldn’t be together, but you wouldn’t have done so great yourself."
16890,Leonard,okay. come on. upsy-daisy.
19134,Leonard,"no, i mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than wolowitz?"
17136,Leonard,fine.
18221,Leonard,"look, i appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. if i get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me."
13063,Leonard,i agree. sheldon’s sister is hiding at penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time. 
17209,Leonard,‘sup?
14171,Leonard,"we got an e-mail from the east rutherford, new jersey, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender alliance. they want another thousand penny blossoms."
18159,Leonard,those things can still happen.
15740,Leonard,"okay, where are you?"
15677,Leonard,isn’t that flammable?
20079,Leonard,you do?
18683,Leonard,okay.
12767,Leonard,what the hell are you doing?
20525,Leonard,sure.
12363,Leonard,make it two. 
20888,Leonard,are you okay?
12785,Leonard,"i’m at work, sheldon.  "
17392,Leonard,"also instead of just living in your mother’s house, you could actually live inside her body."
17395,Leonard,"good for you, howard. i’m proud of you. and still, you’re the first one of us to get married. we have to do something special."
16600,Leonard,"excuse me. you’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you’ve got is buck up?"
13419,Leonard,"watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!"
21255,Leonard,"well, i’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. how long do you think he’ll stay?"
17750,Leonard,"oh. you know, i’m really starting to not like this guy."
20394,Leonard,"no, he’s fine. we just needed a little break."
19110,Leonard,"so, sheldon, tell us about your trip. where’d you go?"
17220,Leonard,"i thought because our relationship’s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow."
18361,Leonard,you ready to go?
15332,Leonard,want a cup of coffee?
21115,Leonard,is the wi-fi working for you?
18931,Leonard,no.
17101,Leonard,i have feelings for you.
20708,Leonard,does this mean emily’s not in the picture anymore?
16638,Leonard,"so, here we are. back in bed together."
16987,Leonard,"there’s this guy, jimmy speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. he sent me a message through facebook. he’s in town and wants to have drinks."
18450,Leonard,"hey, sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that."
19553,Leonard,what? is it wrong? have you seen it somewhere else?
17033,Leonard,"well, yeah, thanks, jimmy."
20837,Leonard,hello.
13619,Leonard,sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. i am really sorry about this.
15977,Leonard,you get to play with raj’s big telescope last night?
14646,Leonard,"oh, yeah. it’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport."
17945,Leonard,i don’t know why i avoided the harry potter books for so long. these are great. i just started number six.
12206,Leonard,"also inefficient, and might be loud."
16603,Leonard,"you know what, guys, i’m not in the mood for paintball. what do you say we just bag it?"
12555,Leonard,"right, anyway, uh, with wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. sheldon?"
12784,Leonard,then make soup. 
13959,Leonard,bye.
13285,Leonard,hello.
21383,Leonard,"we do have sheldon’s old room. if he really needs a place to stay, i guess we should offer it to him."
14496,Leonard,"nothing like that happened, all right? the sex was just fine."
12483,Leonard,"there’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact i doubt if he can even spell confrontation."
13482,Leonard,that’s it. no more thai food.
14507,Leonard,"penny, wait. aagh! what is wrong with you?"
14540,Leonard,don’t do that.
17363,Leonard,they’re collectables.
18130,Leonard,"oh, yeah. no. thanks, that would be great help. you realize you might kill some of them."
20239,Leonard,there’s a security camera?
19254,Leonard,she doesn’t flirt with doctors.
19800,Leonard,"hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?"
18369,Leonard,one sec. hey. sorry.
13839,Leonard,"ah, no kidding! a fu man chu? a handlebar pencil?"
13871,Leonard,"uh-oh, he’s stuck in an infinite loop."
21719,Leonard,"excuse me, i’m looking for sheldon cooper’s apartment."
14230,Leonard,problem?
15641,Leonard,"okay, fine. live with cats. be like my aunt nancy. she had dozens of them. and do you know what happened after she died? they ate her."
12268,Leonard,how do i look?
16341,Leonard,"well, now hold on, how about this? how about we still hang out, but on the down-low?"
21182,Leonard,do not need a break.
12462,Leonard,hi.
17211,Leonard,"once i tried carrying around a duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me duncan."
19665,Leonard,yeah?
19469,Leonard,i thought you hate giving gifts.
12556,Leonard,"sheldon, remember, we role-played this."
19335,Leonard,better than okay. i am having the game of my life.
20292,Leonard,justin.
21109,Leonard,"well, you know what’s gonna happen, he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his."
12436,Leonard,"he’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy…"
19185,Leonard,"yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met amy. yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. not the way i would categorize the two of us."
14968,Leonard,hand me the bat.
15030,Leonard,and you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
17501,Leonard,"well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, i didn’t want to look ridiculous."
19291,Leonard,yeah. it just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
20555,Leonard,"sure, we could write something up."
21258,Leonard,remember that when the new tv falls off the wall and crushes us both.
12314,Leonard,"why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?"
20760,Leonard,"it’s not a big deal. go shopping with amy, and we’ll save a spot in line for you."
12065,Leonard,so it’s based on your life?
16192,Leonard,oh.
16046,Leonard,we’re gonna write an application…
12467,Leonard,"if he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him."
13836,Leonard,"well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood."
19945,Leonard,"yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff."
17241,Leonard,positive.
21263,Leonard,no.
13628,Leonard,"all i’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?"
12159,Leonard,"sheldon, this is not your home."
18932,Leonard,"raj and howard are at howard’s mom’s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?"
14485,Leonard,how about that? i finally caught a break.
14768,Leonard,so what did justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?
18290,Leonard,okay.
13342,Leonard,"well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren’t very supportive."
16427,Leonard,"oh, yeah? what about it?"
12341,Leonard,thank you for coming on such short notice.
19728,Leonard,keep going.
19482,Leonard,now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable?
12339,Leonard,like luminous fish.
20668,Leonard,"yeah, that’s right."
19542,Leonard,maybe in the morning.
20156,Leonard,of course. she deserves to be happy.
15175,Leonard,no.
12957,Leonard,snipe.
17896,Leonard,i don’t believe this.
16988,Leonard,"just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go."
20842,Leonard,"hey, i’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute."
17257,Leonard,wow. that’s rough.
21758,Leonard,"hey, sheldon. this is howard and raj. they work at the university, too."
21575,Leonard,"fine. i accept your premise, now please let’s go."
15709,Leonard,what the hell? how long has she been here?
14814,Leonard,what if you could make kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
18971,Leonard,"yeah, well, when i die, you can rent a bounce house."
15193,Leonard,"i came in here, you guys were all sleeping. the ring was on the floor. no one was touching it."
18534,Leonard,sure.
21562,Leonard,"eh, i’m worth it."
15131,Leonard,it’s not that big a deal. you just go down to the court on thursday and you pay the fine.
14037,Leonard,here we go.
20819,Leonard,we’re not gonna be brothers. we’re not gonna be stepbrothers. go to sleep.
20114,Leonard,i spent the night in mexico with sheldon.
14614,Leonard,"yeah, i don’t remember that."
14494,Leonard,"nothing flamed out. we don’t have to have sex every night, you know."
20581,Leonard,okay. we’ll be back as soon as we can.
21321,Leonard,"but raj is from india, which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath."
14522,Leonard,"god, i had the most horrible night."
14043,Leonard,"we? no, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. right now, you are you, and you are screwed."
15839,Leonard,"no, no, no, would it help if i told you that i offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it."
14741,Leonard,"oh, come on. this is stupid."
16363,Leonard,"good, good. i’ll tell you what happens."
18587,Leonard,no.
20296,Leonard,sure you did.
14931,Leonard,you’re welcome. how’s your fish?
17038,Leonard,you remember sheldon and raj and howard.
13503,Leonard,just eat.
13427,Leonard,no kidding.
18895,Leonard,"okay, this was helpful."
14144,Leonard,"w-w-wait, what’s going on?"
20157,Leonard,"listen, i should warn you that maybe asking amy out isn’t a good idea."
12667,Leonard,"look, if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me."
13167,Leonard,you’re not helping. 
19359,Leonard,"oh, the girls really did a nice job."
19341,Leonard,but the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. it doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.
14447,Leonard,"damn his vulcan hearing. not a good time, sheldon."
18750,Leonard,i wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.
13969,Leonard,yes.
19273,Leonard,"sure. in my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex."
20830,Leonard,you don’t know his girlfriend very well.
14490,Leonard,totally.
14676,Leonard,oh.
20916,Leonard,"mm-hmm. for two of us, it’s in the right direction."
15832,Leonard,"yeah, i, uh, went for a drink."
17317,Leonard,stop! stop it! stop! stop! stop it!
15551,Leonard,good night.
18022,Leonard,okay. i know i propose a lot. so how about this? i promise i will never ask you to marry me again.
12870,Leonard,i think that’s our girl. one of us should go talk to her. 
14441,Leonard,"uh, oh, sorry."
16933,Leonard,"if that’s so, what if i start talking to a girl?"
20229,Leonard,it says right here on wikipedia. a mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.
20018,Leonard,"yeah. okay, listen. if you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. we, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. the boat was moving a lot, so i chipped her tooth."
15858,Leonard,"fine, sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents."
17535,Leonard,gelatinous sphere.
19866,Leonard,"no, it’s like that. well, i’m excited to show you around."
21075,Leonard,"you just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it’s not…"
16542,Leonard,"oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t."
12866,Leonard,like what? we can’t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.  
15442,Leonard,"i don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…"
21459,Leonard,"relax. i know when you go for a run, you stop for a donut."
18360,Leonard,i gotta go.
16581,Leonard,what’s going on?
17739,Leonard,sure.
13316,Leonard,"it’s thursday. listen, penny."
13968,Leonard,yes.
12443,Leonard,"no, it’s not…"
21681,Leonard,hello.
21180,Leonard,thank you.
12636,Leonard,"great, be right back."
15680,Leonard,so what’s going on with you two?
20087,Leonard,wow.
19382,Leonard,"buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don’t die?"
20889,Leonard,"according to the world’s worst cuckoo clock, it’s two."
20877,Leonard,"sure, i’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander."
20415,Leonard,"well, i hope it’s as much fun as the sheldon cooper spell-checks local menus tour."
15868,Leonard,would you please get that?
17954,Leonard,no.
12471,Leonard,"look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners."
12098,Leonard,wow.
17869,Leonard,sheldon threw us all under the bus.
15334,Leonard,what am i smelling?
19593,Leonard,"oh, really?"
14761,Leonard,thank you.
13079,Leonard,thank you.
13399,Leonard,you tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
13247,Leonard,"what? i’ve dated plenty of women. there was joyce kim, leslie winkle."
18445,Leonard,"oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him."
17883,Leonard,"well, it’s a lot smaller. it’s more about the comic books. the way these conventions used to be before they went all hollywood."
12177,Leonard,o-o-o-oh! .
17536,Leonard,why would i be interested? i have penny.
13710,Leonard,"okay, well, i ju… i think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, i had it!"
12680,Leonard,oh jeez. is this suit really look that bad?
15080,Leonard,no.
17203,Leonard,"you know what, i am sick of the roommate agreement. it’s ridiculous. i’m your roommate, not your chauffeur. you know, i had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in garden grove because the one in pasadena has gotten too big for its britches."
20177,Leonard,yes.
17380,Leonard,"boy, a restraining order from stephen hawking. it’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from leonard nimoy, carl sagan and stan lee."
13191,Leonard,"well, we sort of decided to wing it. "
16396,Leonard,"i’m not going to do that, sheldon."
16874,Leonard,"i’m single, i don’t need this crap."
12406,Leonard,"hey, lesley."
12702,Leonard,what was i supposed to say. 
15723,Leonard,"all right, well, let me see if i can explain your situation using physics. what would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?"
19919,Leonard,"okay, mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else."
18797,Leonard,huh?
19403,Leonard,i don’t think he had a family.
12049,Leonard,what?
13823,Leonard,thank you. i should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
16689,Leonard,"i just can’t figure out what happened. i put my left leg in, i took my left leg out, i put my left leg in, and something just snapped."
20295,Leonard,because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
16886,Leonard,"amy, what are you doing here?"
14926,Leonard,"oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? they don’t let just anyone have a web site."
17202,Leonard,"whatever, sheldon. i’m exhausted. i’m not taking you to the dentist."
14681,Leonard,football. i’m going to penny’s on saturday to watch a game with her friends and i don’t want to look like an idiot. i want to blend in.
12707,Leonard,"it’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at. "
14123,Leonard,"i see. well, it seems once again, you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place."
14273,Leonard,"i’ve never been there, have you?"
21162,Leonard,"well, he didn’t throw up on the baby. that’s a win."
21041,Leonard,"i’m kidding, i want you to feel at home here. decorate it any way that makes you happy."
19729,Leonard,"if it’s half as much fun as one times ten to the fourth bottles of beer on the wall, i’m in."
20672,Leonard,you love the simpsons.
20752,Leonard,"well, i can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life."
12924,Leonard,she’s in. 
20626,Leonard,"well, never have i ever used sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink."
14132,Leonard,"hey, penny. leonard again."
12146,Leonard,"we don’t need strength, we’re physicists. we are the intellectual descendents of archimedes. give me a fulcrum and a lever and i can move the earth, it’s just a matter…  i don’t have this… i don’t have this i don’t have this."
20132,Leonard,will you knock it off? we’re across the hall.
21613,Leonard,"hey, wh-where are you going?"
18235,Leonard,"really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party."
18471,Leonard,sure.
17688,Leonard,i thought you had plans with amy.
20932,Leonard,"it’s weird. this must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. unless they feel sad, then it’s different."
12890,Leonard,"after we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?"
14529,Leonard,little bit. 
14087,Leonard,this conference is kind of a big thing. the keynote address is being delivered by george smoot.
20475,Leonard,we are young and fun.
12444,Leonard,"terrific. um, this party is my first chance for penny to see me in the context of her social group, and i need you not to embarrass me tonight. "
14249,Leonard,how about those two?
14831,Leonard,"relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys."
13911,Leonard,"well, what was the plan?"
14094,Leonard,wow. teasing the guys at the apple store seems a little redundant now.
20489,Leonard,go out and celebrate. but not your worst idea.
18158,Leonard,"oh, my cute little tushy strikes again."
19682,Leonard,seems a shame to throw it away.
13941,Leonard,"guys, there are four of us and one of him."
20979,Leonard,"oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers."
18556,Leonard,"oh, there is no winning with you. and koalas and otters don’t even live near each other."
16813,Leonard,you can have my car.
17597,Leonard,"no good, sheldon doesn’t float."
20381,Leonard,"oh, i actually did hear your eyes roll that time."
12586,Leonard,"oh, hey. "
15143,Leonard,"okay, that’s enough, howard. the poor guy’s had a tough time. he had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit."
16360,Leonard,"why don’t we play this smart? try a little good goblin, bad goblin."
12016,Leonard,okay.
19029,Leonard,"hey, hey, what the hell?"
15102,Leonard,"well, forget it. i was the one who was invited, i get to decide who goes with me, and it’s penny, not you!"
12713,Leonard,"i’m sorry, i’m not seeing the help."
20206,Leonard,here’s the money. can we do this?
16969,Leonard,"sure, sure. uh, when will stuart be back?"
20190,Leonard,remember? don’t ask too many questions?
15386,Leonard,"okay, i’ll give you one more clue. it involved another person."
19771,Leonard,"you know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, i looked through a door, and i’m pretty sure i saw a display case with the ark of the covenant."
17142,Leonard,"oh, that is not true."
20112,Leonard,we got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off.
21751,Leonard,we have a flag?
12970,Leonard,"hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, i can drop you off at work yesterday. time travel joke, it’s not… never mind. "
21615,Leonard,"hello. oh, hi. yeah, hold on a second. i’ll get him. sheldon, it’s for you."
19773,Leonard,i guess this could count as an adventure.
14182,Leonard,what?
17167,Leonard,even doctor who?
15203,Leonard,"sheldon? sheldon, are you okay?"
21637,Leonard,"oh, that’s right. thursday is stan lee day."
18999,Leonard,i’m her boyfriend.
18241,Leonard,it’s not a competition.
13490,Leonard,"yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current mrs. wolowitz."
12921,Leonard,"there’s not? gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be. "
20350,Leonard,we will.
20283,Leonard,"it’s just the four digits, month and day."
19535,Leonard,what is going on?
19830,Leonard,i don’t know. should we call sheldon and howard?
18733,Leonard,"sheldon, buddy, i just don’t think this is going to come together for you."
12013,Leonard,"well, what do you want to do?"
15284,Leonard,since when do you take after-dinner walks?
12770,Leonard,"sheldon, you are not sick. this is, but you are not. "
19413,Leonard,"because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?"
13668,Leonard,"oh come on! sheldon, we don’t ask questions like that."
19290,Leonard,"i usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good."
16568,Leonard,"oh, come on! why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?"
19497,Leonard,is it my turn to talk about the compromises i make?
17021,Leonard,nancy. you called me nancy for three years.
13454,Leonard,uh…
20442,Leonard,"yeah, just get it over with."
19831,Leonard,okay. great. how do you want to start?
13414,Leonard,"okay, fasten your seat belt."
17824,Leonard,"you did it. the drawbridge is down. you cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. and in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten santa claus. he says, ho, ho, help me."
16322,Leonard,"okay, i’m leaving before the black helicopters get here."
19718,Leonard,"of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. uh, new salon topic. what’s more important, an idea or its execution?"
16809,Leonard,no. but jessica alba did rub my furry belly.
19720,Leonard,"oh, now he’s a genius? all you ever do is make fun of him and engineering."
14379,Leonard,you went to president seibert’s house in the middle of the night?
13430,Leonard,"fine. assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior homo novus get to work tomorrow morning?"
15101,Leonard,she told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
18774,Leonard,i saw a thai place next door.
13682,Leonard,we’re not… where’s my bat signal?
14629,Leonard,"yeah, i’m familiar with bert and ernie."
21015,Leonard,"sheldon, this is not a big deal. it’s a little white lie, everyone does it."
17663,Leonard,"hang on. okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. chess clock. we each get five minutes to talk about our problems. we’ll take turns. each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. begin."
18627,Leonard,"you know, i think we’re zeroing in on your problem."
14165,Leonard,how are we doing?
21740,Leonard,"uh, i’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge."
12238,Leonard,"right. lesley, i would like to propose an experiment."
15775,Leonard,"sheldon, you need to work in the morning."
16045,Leonard,she’s not going to steal our idea.
15069,Leonard,"no. but it does involve air travel. okay, um, let me slice this swiss cheese with my swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of swiss miss instant cocoa."
13750,Leonard,i was working with dave underhill.
17364,Leonard,once you open the box it loses its value.
16438,Leonard,"no reason. i was just talking to raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days."
14072,Leonard,golden dragon.
14352,Leonard,"yeah. right. sure. the thing is, before you guys went out, i spoke to him and…"
20971,Leonard,did we really need to be here for this?
18827,Leonard,"well, but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?"
19809,Leonard,are those my sheets?
19184,Leonard,yeah. i’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
13800,Leonard,uh-huh?
21692,Leonard,"hi. i’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. really? um, okay. is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘cause we’re just talking hours here."
18670,Leonard,"penny proposed, and i didn’t say yes."
20462,Leonard,"sixth grade, but i wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…"
18890,Leonard,were you seeing other men?
20210,Leonard,let’s just start the experiment.
16854,Leonard,"okay, uh, here it is. i met this girl and i kissed her, and i feel terrible about it. but it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. and i am so, so sorry."
15761,Leonard,yeah. it’s good to see you too. here you go.
21451,Leonard,seven.
19920,Leonard,"oh, really? that’s too bad."
19599,Leonard,you will not believe what stephen hawking just said.
17732,Leonard,"you, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?"
20273,Leonard,what happened?
20994,Leonard,"no, no, no. it’s not okay."
12141,Leonard,"unless, superman matches her speed and decelerates. "
16453,Leonard,"yeah, fine."
15341,Leonard,"when you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?"
17517,Leonard,"actually, to this day, she’s never really said it."
20883,Leonard,"oh, that is so nice."
13375,Leonard,yes.
15574,Leonard,"i don’t want to listen to music, sheldon."
12173,Leonard,"no, no. you gave me an explanation, it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers."
12766,Leonard,no problem. welcome home. 
18552,Leonard,"no, it’s all over."
16557,Leonard,"okay, well, how about this. until priya gets her own place, you stay here and i’ll stay at your apartment."
19256,Leonard,"i think what penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it’s like a cat riding a roomba."
16715,Leonard,it’s from game of thrones. what do you think?
13902,Leonard,"oh, wait, you lent her money?"
16522,Leonard,go sit over there.
21135,Leonard,why? i said i didn’t care.
15127,Leonard,"good, good, so, who’s stan lee?"
20725,Leonard,thanks.
17293,Leonard,"excuse us for a second. sheldon, it’s okay, he can do it. he’s a barber."
18495,Leonard,no.
19929,Leonard,yeah. i wish i’d fought harder for the rest of ’em.
17840,Leonard,"to my bones. i mean, i’m not gonna do anything about it. i love penny. it’s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods."
14410,Leonard,"sheldon, you know i can’t eat butter. i’m lactose intolerant."
12910,Leonard,thanks for the heads up. 
20616,Leonard,they have some board games.
20700,Leonard,better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? nope.
14871,Leonard,"well, i just, i thought…"
17195,Leonard,"oh, fun. i get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the village people."
16361,Leonard,that’s not where it was going.
14956,Leonard,it’s obviously a typo.
20215,Leonard,it’s probably usc or ucla.
18665,Leonard,"penny, don’t."
13240,Leonard,"it wasn’t awkward. it wasn’t fun. besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on."
14747,Leonard,i am not going to fold.
14891,Leonard,what?
18889,Leonard,was it the two women thing or the playa? it was the playa.
13748,Leonard,"actually, i was…"
14880,Leonard,"wait, wait, wait. you had surgery?"
20308,Leonard,i’m sorry about the journal. i want to make it up to you. so i’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on facebook.
19047,Leonard,"actually, this is about where she and i are going to live."
20661,Leonard,you’re being ridiculous.
18462,Leonard,"yeah, sure."
16504,Leonard,hang on. when is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
16339,Leonard,"well, now, hold on. what kind of distance are we talking about? because we are neighbours. i mean, i can hear the toilet flush in your apartment."
21227,Leonard,is it about the failing state of my relationship with penny?
18624,Leonard,no. do you?
20326,Leonard,"oh, yeah, he got a tuba."
19798,Leonard,i went to school for half my life. i have a doctorate. i’m still paying off college loans.
18479,Leonard,"hmm, i think i got them all. nope, they’re not in there."
14124,Leonard,"give me the phone. hi, penny. it’s leonard."
13923,Leonard,"oh, no. oh, you don’t want to do that."
19179,Leonard,because it doesn’t matter. i don’t care if we’re a ten or a two.
21271,Leonard,did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?
20474,Leonard,"oh, thank god."
16918,Leonard,really? you would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
13955,Leonard,it’s kind of a fashionable look these days.
13869,Leonard,"sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!"
15166,Leonard,give me that.
16773,Leonard,"so, mrs. cooper, what did you think of the sushi?"
17888,Leonard,"i’m turning it on, but just to shut you up."
18544,Leonard,you’re the one who invited him here.
19085,Leonard,"sheldon, if you really need to do this, i’m not gonna stand in your way."
12856,Leonard,is that even possible?
20980,Leonard,are you kidding? i once paid twenty dollars for theo sassler’s signature.
16953,Leonard,"well, then, i’m putting sex back on the table. what do you think about that?"
21035,Leonard,"ooh, maybe i could turn it into a gaming den."
20609,Leonard,why are you so mean to me?
18901,Leonard,"penny, have you seen my good inhaler?"
16333,Leonard,move out.
14325,Leonard,"well, yeah, stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store."
12290,Leonard,"you’re kidding, well, then, that’s something we have in common. "
15396,Leonard,i thought we had something special.
20466,Leonard,"well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had."
18204,Leonard,"double potion, please."
14922,Leonard,how did we get actual women?
16523,Leonard,is there a history of heart disease in your family?
17974,Leonard,"cut to the chase, sheldon."
17899,Leonard,i thought we agreed this was all koothrappali’s fault.
19976,Leonard,and it’s the happiest day of our lives.
14297,Leonard,"okay, terrific. um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…"
14423,Leonard,"yes, obviously."
12884,Leonard,"come on, you need a four person team, we’re four people. "
18315,Leonard,"wait, i got it. i got it/"
19113,Leonard,"i’m sorry, so you never went outside?"
20045,Leonard,i would love that.
16571,Leonard,you’re moving back to india?
17898,Leonard,what kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight?
18459,Leonard,"okay, we’re almost ready to go. once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes."
15648,Leonard,i saw what you did there.
20583,Leonard,i know. i’m lowering the bar so slowly. this time next year she’ll have a coin collection.
13623,Leonard,stephanie barnett is single.
15338,Leonard,"here’s an idea. i’m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex."
20403,Leonard,"well, vegas, but…"
12226,Leonard,"no problem. bye. oh, and, bye, bro! ."
13113,Leonard,what’s going on?
18176,Leonard,that’s not ridiculous. good night.
13658,Leonard,do you understand that stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
16924,Leonard,"no, i love them. i save them for the end, but they’re gone because you ate them. and why did i let you eat them?"
13199,Leonard,"hey, penny, if you’re not doing anything friday night i thought maybe we could go and see a movie. "
14839,Leonard,you’re welcome to come.
12657,Leonard,you’re kidding. 
16518,Leonard,"i don’t know, i just got a text. come on, hurry."
16625,Leonard,"hey, honey."
13371,Leonard,"it’s not a date, and that’s racist."
18643,Leonard,"i don’t know, i got all confused when you said honestly."
20836,Leonard,that still leaves me here with him.
15889,Leonard,"relax, it’s five o’clock. the movie doesn’t start till midnight."
19980,Leonard,"aw. that’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  oh, excuse me. sheldon. hey."
18012,Leonard,i thought we were letting it go.
17812,Leonard,"okay, continuing our quest."
20468,Leonard,"let’s see. what’s young and fun? uh, we could go dancing."
17859,Leonard,you do that?
17154,Leonard,"yes, and i think we should go anyway."
21610,Leonard,science?
12243,Leonard,"you mean, kiss you now?"
13535,Leonard,sheldon’s kryptonite.
16155,Leonard,"on the bright side, i don’t think president siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers."
21666,Leonard,excuse me.
13778,Leonard,do whatever you want.
16859,Leonard,"oh yeah, it is, and you won. i, i, i’m, i’m sorry, i have to go. i don’t believe this."
18860,Leonard,great.
19934,Leonard,"so, why haven’t we picked a date?"
21071,Leonard,it’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.
20665,Leonard,leave me alone.
15068,Leonard,just a minute. this tray contains clues as to what you and i are going to be doing on valentine’s day.
18608,Leonard,hang on. why would i be fat?
19488,Leonard,that’s true.
13465,Leonard,"yeah, i can see that. sheldon, halo night, koothrappali’s. you coming?"
16815,Leonard,thanks.
17877,Leonard,"okay, come with me."
20735,Leonard,what good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about armageddon?
12125,Leonard,really? great.
20996,Leonard,i am.
19441,Leonard,"okay, so if i remain calm, i’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?"
15853,Leonard,"my problem is, i don’t project confidence. so i decided that the next time i meet a woman i think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, i’m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance."
17911,Leonard,"no, that can’t be right."
16673,Leonard,"well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, i can tell you that."
19875,Leonard,"really? sex last night, pancakes this morning, am i dying?"
15643,Leonard,he’s in his bedroom.
12172,Leonard,"do you realise that if penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?"
15864,Leonard,really?
21531,Leonard,"sir, i, i, i’m sorry but i just don’t get it. you came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn’t even tell us?"
19031,Leonard,you okay?
18017,Leonard,"yep. you know what? that was pretty crappy of you. i mean, all i wanted to do was give you a great night, and it’s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it."
17932,Leonard,"come on, sheldon, we’re going to be late."
19485,Leonard,"well, yeah."
14790,Leonard,what kind of score are we looking at?
19365,Leonard,very funny.
20633,Leonard,six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.
20969,Leonard,why does she get that? we never got that.
13514,Leonard,to do what?
19044,Leonard,"so, listen, there was something i was hoping to float past you."
15718,Leonard,"look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level."
16253,Leonard,"okay, well, tell him i loved him on star trek."
14697,Leonard,"none, why?"
14236,Leonard,when did you pick up on that?
19130,Leonard,what?
15061,Leonard,i am taking penny.
12826,Leonard,how about that. 
17088,Leonard,"hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? see how that goes."
18812,Leonard,fancy sounds like a compliment.
13627,Leonard,because this is not star trek
14101,Leonard,maybe john connor’s aboard and she’s protecting him from an evil terminator.
15517,Leonard,"excuse me, could you help us out?"
15795,Leonard,"uh, rash, that’s a bad rash."
15722,Leonard,"well, have you considered telling her how you feel?"
13450,Leonard,what do you mean “deal”?
18433,Leonard,you made the bed? you really are pulling out all the stops.
16181,Leonard,"i repeat, not gonna happen."
16681,Leonard,"no, thank you. i’m really not much of a dancer."
12402,Leonard,she fixed your equation.
12563,Leonard,"you’re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact. "
20144,Leonard,preach.
19604,Leonard,"we know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime."
20586,Leonard,"okay, we’ll take ’em. but, i swear, if it’s will smith in shark tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original."
13973,Leonard,yes.
13730,Leonard,terrific.
17125,Leonard,"yeah, well, so was i."
17568,Leonard,"oh, that happens to be dr. koothrappali’s field of expertise. you two have a lot to talk about."
12836,Leonard,"huh, yeah? "
17279,Leonard,"no, he didn’t. nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. okay, uh, forget one-on-one. let’s try a free throw contest. first person who makes a basket wins the office."
15637,Leonard,"okay, yeah, fine."
13667,Leonard,"i don’t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam."
14525,Leonard,wait a minute. you talked to penny about our sex life?
14889,Leonard,all right. he “has” a “girlfriend.”
15528,Leonard,"that long, huh?"
12419,Leonard,no kidding.
17619,Leonard,"uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer."
18927,Leonard,"great, what do you want to do?"
21170,Leonard,and their sherpas.
12113,Leonard,this is it.  i’ll do the talking.
21746,Leonard,is this it?
12271,Leonard,is it too much?
13305,Leonard,want to catch me up?
17628,Leonard,what? here? now?
15228,Leonard,did you just quote star wars?
16436,Leonard,will amy be joining us for dinner?
14304,Leonard,"just think. thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go"
15207,Leonard,"yeah, we watched it last week. you said you liked it."
15309,Leonard,is it possible he said bros before hos?
21569,Leonard,you think you should call amy?
14992,Leonard,looks like wolowitz got the net electrified.
16269,Leonard,he actually got pretty good. he made us all matching serapes.
18607,Leonard,"oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man."
18743,Leonard,even batman breaks the rules. 
19616,Leonard,that would be great.
16342,Leonard,no. i actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
15880,Leonard,you’re having a guilt-ridden dream.
12825,Leonard,lay it on me. 
20074,Leonard,"too expensive. you’d think i’d be used to women withholding their love. i mean, my mother did. i mean, no matter how hard i tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me."
12476,Leonard,"uh, a hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of middle earth, whereas an elf is an immortal tall warrior. "
17024,Leonard,"hey, for the record, jimmy wasn’t the reason i wet the bed. that one has my mother written all over it."
20204,Leonard,"no, no, no. wait, don’t go. just let me explain. we’re physicists, and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year."
16275,Leonard,"hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, i’d be okay with that."
16763,Leonard,what’s gunning with god? i’m afraid to ask.
20106,Leonard,i don’t think the lever’s working.
15530,Leonard,"so, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?"
18824,Leonard,"hey. i mean, it’s been a little tough, but penny’s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing."
13856,Leonard,"it’s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum."
13976,Leonard,"here’s your tea, mother. so, what are you guys talking about?"
19073,Leonard,sheldon.
13785,Leonard,"well, uh, the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible!"
13934,Leonard,i do.
19352,Leonard,"if you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you’d be like the toughest kid on the disney channel. so, anything else planned for tonight?"
16158,Leonard,you’re kidding. that was good for you? ‘cause i was sweating through my t-shirt.
14220,Leonard,"oh, absolutely."
19805,Leonard,"great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature."
18317,Leonard,"um, i’m okay with you driving my car. i’m not okay with you flying my car."
21593,Leonard,"no, don’t, don’t…."
13532,Leonard,"oh, not junior rodeo. what did you do?"
20374,Leonard,"do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?"
14257,Leonard,say what?
16728,Leonard,two ten and you throw in the iron man helmet.
21305,Leonard,okay. this is everything he had on the board. i’m sure we can figure the rest out.
14937,Leonard,what the hell is eighth base?
16781,Leonard,i’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
15598,Leonard,what?
13473,Leonard,"don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t  aw! what’s going on?"
17514,Leonard,penny and i have some issues we need to talk about.
15874,Leonard,really? maybe sleep has met you before.
21384,Leonard,am i still a good friend if i wait and hope that howard offers him a place to live first?
14702,Leonard,what the hell are you talking about?
12580,Leonard,"well, maybe we are like haroun and tanweer. "
19796,Leonard,"wait, twice?"
16586,Leonard,hey.
12418,Leonard,"well, that part’s true! "
16784,Leonard,"mrs. cooper, we say catholics, not rosary rattlers."
13056,Leonard,"okay, uh…. oh, consider this. with your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate. "
20315,Leonard,"well, hum it again. is that the spongebob song?"
16942,Leonard,that’s kind of between me and…
15051,Leonard,"sheldon, come here."
13534,Leonard,"all right, i really didn’t want to do this, but… here."
14627,Leonard,"not really. i googled how to do that. so, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?"
17378,Leonard,"that’s amazing. you’ll be like his pit crew. a word of caution, i would not do your stephen hawking impression in front of him."
15892,Leonard,excellent.
13387,Leonard,you want to breed a new friend?
17067,Leonard,glad i could help.
20804,Leonard,"mom, please save something for the toast."
13269,Leonard,"why, what’s so unusual about me having a date?"
12564,Leonard,"now, raj, kill sheldon."
14110,Leonard,what’s the matter?
15144,Leonard,except for raj.
14930,Leonard,"no, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact."
13348,Leonard,smile. 
20053,Leonard,i’m not being weird. am i being weird?
19002,Leonard,"yeah, but it’s not always that bad."
18507,Leonard,"oh, oh, no, no. it’s because i spent all afternoon at the armenian church where his funeral mass was held. according to father solakian, no one attended. luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. i lit a candle and prayed for your death but i’m not armenian, so it probably won’t work. this is over, right?"
20650,Leonard,really? the guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? how is that possible?
17045,Leonard,for all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
21730,Leonard,okay.
15229,Leonard,"oh, my god. i’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote yoda. i love you, penny."
15237,Leonard,i honestly don’t care.
15679,Leonard,thank you.
12130,Leonard,here we go.
20248,Leonard,yeah.
16539,Leonard,it doesn’t matter. i’m the king of foreplay.
21205,Leonard,hey.
17494,Leonard,"then i believe that god created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me."
15468,Leonard,how is that my fault?
20259,Leonard,"hey, i made french toast sticks."
12797,Leonard,"uh, yeah, i’d be… i’d be happy to penny.  i feel really guilty. "
12323,Leonard,"interesting, you should lead with that."
20649,Leonard,you mean like through their window from behind a bush?
14013,Leonard,this is actually gonna happen.
12075,Leonard,how so?
14005,Leonard,"hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. you know what i used to do when i was little to have some sensation of human contact?"
12497,Leonard,"are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here?"
20257,Leonard,you’re in a good mood.
17956,Leonard,"to live with penny and not you, you crazy bastard."
20734,Leonard,"no, i mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system."
14915,Leonard,i’m over it.
16294,Leonard,"oh, hi."
20613,Leonard,and there goes our hike.
16823,Leonard,"okay, uh, here it is. is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…"
17051,Leonard,"yeah, i feel pretty good about myself. you think we can outrun him?"
16329,Leonard,bye.
15393,Leonard,elizabeth? what’s going on?
20006,Leonard,yeah.
21529,Leonard,where is everything?
15797,Leonard,"okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go."
16044,Leonard,what?
17443,Leonard,"again, i’m sorry. you know, with howard and bernadette getting married, i got caught up in a little wedding fever. i take it back."
19049,Leonard,that’s very sweet. but we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.
17147,Leonard,isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
12003,Leonard,can we please stop saying coitus?
16477,Leonard,"that, that’s brilliant."
12656,Leonard,"you’re right, this side does look better. "
13026,Leonard,"oh, hey buddy. "
20324,Leonard,"what do you want, a medal? it was your gum."
18845,Leonard,what do you guys want to do tonight?
12547,Leonard,"this isn’t a substitution, it’s a reduction. "
14003,Leonard,"oh, yeah, there she is. hi, mom."
13820,Leonard,"well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine."
17657,Leonard,what are you doing?
13765,Leonard,"uh, yeah. i guess."
15526,Leonard,i don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
21542,Leonard,"uh, could i talk to you in the hall for a sec?"
21635,Leonard,"what! what, what, what?"
13795,Leonard,it’s a saturnalia miracle.
17467,Leonard,what are you doing?
13630,Leonard,what are you doing?
19789,Leonard,"stay out of it, kevin smith."
14202,Leonard,"uh, yeah, i’d love to."
15632,Leonard,so you decided to get the whole manhattan project?
16976,Leonard,it’s you.
18809,Leonard,oh. this is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?
17054,Leonard,"sheldon, he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. i really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the green lantern movie."
17044,Leonard,"yeah, you did. so, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. and , and, and thanks for the apology."
20059,Leonard,are we done?
13044,Leonard,"uh, yeah, no, uh, bye penny."
21587,Leonard,vulcan nerve pinch!
12361,Leonard,"just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers."
17662,Leonard,is it possible we’re having two different conversations?
14923,Leonard,"i hope you’re hungry, bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant."
15541,Leonard,"it’s okay, you can owe me."
13985,Leonard,"please, don’t go there, howard."
16320,Leonard,"holy crap, are you connected to the oak ridge national laboratory?"
14346,Leonard,it wasn’t bad advice. it just wasn’t particularly helpful.
15638,Leonard,terrific. my-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
18403,Leonard,aw.
14855,Leonard,"or loud noises, clowns and nuns."
16350,Leonard,not the kind with access to drugs.
13870,Leonard,"yes, he’s new at the zoo."
15544,Leonard,what the hell? what’s the matter?
20643,Leonard,i love you.
21262,Leonard,"no, it doesn’t."
20207,Leonard,it’s actually pretty common in our field. there’s not much you can do about it.
15651,Leonard,hang on a second. i could have the fruit platter.
19598,Leonard,"and you as well, mr. our-premise-is-intriguing."
21506,Leonard,"yeah, it’s weird."
14556,Leonard,"yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour."
18754,Leonard,"got you a little something, too."
19187,Leonard,what happens if she doesn’t like us?
13445,Leonard,"uh, the kitchen’s fine.  hey, what are you doing?"
13442,Leonard,"hey, leslie."
14750,Leonard,what?
12950,Leonard,"no, a time machine from sophie’s choice. "
15000,Leonard,maybe you need a fresh start.
12764,Leonard,"penny, you’ll have to excuse sheldon, he’s a bit of a germophobe. "
18355,Leonard,so you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
19094,Leonard,"hey, buddy. good to hear your voice."
12745,Leonard,who are you? 
13997,Leonard,yep.
12137,Leonard,"so, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?"
19657,Leonard,okay.
18277,Leonard,so am i driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
14726,Leonard,he’s drowning us out. he doesn’t like fighting.
15907,Leonard,why do you read his twitter feed? you know it’s only going to upset you.
16583,Leonard,"just let it go, sheldon."
21743,Leonard,when i have to.
20825,Leonard,"not helping, buddy. mother, penny and i really want you to be part of this. please stay."
19706,Leonard,thank you. what did he say?
16445,Leonard,you’re pregnant?
12024,Leonard,hi.
16735,Leonard,"no, i was gonna grab raj and howard and have a good time."
18371,Leonard,leave it alone. that’s my girlfriend.
18913,Leonard,one of the people that lives in his head.
19898,Leonard,thank you.
14248,Leonard,that’s your system?
19631,Leonard,let’s have a toast. to mrs. wolowitz. a loving mother to all of us. we’ll miss you.
15672,Leonard,"ah. well, i guess for you guys that’s like regular golf."
19931,Leonard,really good.
15867,Leonard,could you get that?
19926,Leonard,i’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.
15504,Leonard,four months.
17788,Leonard,"oh, before i forget, saturday i’m planning a little dungeons and dragons night with the guys."
15116,Leonard,"hey, sheldon? listen, penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to switzerland. so if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come. "
19055,Leonard,"well, yeah."
20486,Leonard,"buddy, i, i think you might be overreacting."
19032,Leonard,"that’s a rude thing to say, out loud."
19081,Leonard,what? why?
18517,Leonard,i want to go.
21229,Leonard,"i would pull this car over and kick you out, but if penny dumps me, you’re all i got. "
20823,Leonard,"yeah, drive safe. "
19914,Leonard,"not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, i always had to earn it."
15928,Leonard,you think?
18725,Leonard,"oh, thursday’s gone. just sunday left."
17679,Leonard,"that’s not true. uh, slavery. 1619. your name at the top. that’s all you."
19212,Leonard,that’s not what happened.
20903,Leonard,right. listen to me. we can’t do anything until you do your part. so get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
21601,Leonard,"hey, listen, i know you said that you didn’t want to talk…"
12788,Leonard,"howard, it’s leonard, code milky green. "
20219,Leonard,thank you for coming back.
14874,Leonard,"okay, sorry."
20201,Leonard,i don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a mexican standoff. what are we gonna do here?
20262,Leonard,what? i don’t want to do that.
18209,Leonard,"ooh! sorry, i thought you were gonna do that."
15745,Leonard,"yeah. so, bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?"
20355,Leonard,"so, if you don’t like star wars, why are you here?"
20481,Leonard,what? congratulations.
16679,Leonard,ready.
19260,Leonard,hmm.
16262,Leonard,i hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from texas.
19412,Leonard,"oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems."
19570,Leonard,"one, two three."
18171,Leonard,and he wrote him a cheque.
14381,Leonard,hardly a day goes by when i don’t think about it.
15891,Leonard,"oh. well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw star trek: nemesis."
18531,Leonard,why are you mad at me? you’re the one that did the stupid thing. i’m just trying to fix it.
18528,Leonard,"okay, i found the, uh, court papers that you and zack need to fill out. i’ll print them when we get home."
14786,Leonard,the only thing in here are blue ice packs.
13575,Leonard,i’m hoping that’s three different guys.
19933,Leonard,"yeah, we’ll pick a date when we pick a date."
20231,Leonard,"you tell me, you woke up in bed with one."
14215,Leonard,"way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, sheldon."
17074,Leonard,"okay, let’s talk about that."
21631,Leonard,"fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la."
21443,Leonard,"oh, i would, but we need to make a push on the air force project."
20783,Leonard,seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
12445,Leonard,"for example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is leakey. "
16777,Leonard,you want some oreos?
20042,Leonard,"wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?"
16206,Leonard,i didn’t do it for the money!
20709,Leonard,"okay, help me out. how are you doing this? do they know about each other?"
21478,Leonard,"oh, hello. join us."
20577,Leonard,"and it helps to have small, delicate fingers. so don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and howard."
21013,Leonard,she’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.
16699,Leonard,"hey, how go the wedding plans, howard?"
20983,Leonard,never been on this side of the table before. i feel powerful.
12463,Leonard,why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?
14065,Leonard,why are you crouching there?
12965,Leonard,yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years. 
17925,Leonard,"they could show bloopers. oh, no."
18990,Leonard,"hey, buddy. heard you’re having a rough day. you all right?"
19867,Leonard,"yes. we’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but i’m not doing that either.  uh-oh. i just got an alert. our flight’s been cancelled."
16473,Leonard,really?
21636,Leonard,"gesundheit. or as they say in switzerland, gesundheit. you getting a cold?"
13170,Leonard,hi. 
19818,Leonard,yeah.
20391,Leonard,let me refresh your memory.
16680,Leonard,"amy, this is for you."
18720,Leonard,"well, this is it, this is it. this is it."
19715,Leonard,"so, stuart, have you thought about what you’d do if howard sells the house?"
17345,Leonard,"well, we’re always the good guys. in d&d, we’re lawful good, in city of heroes, we’re the heroes, in grand theft auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat."
13007,Leonard,not for long.
14303,Leonard,what were you doing at penny’s?
21040,Leonard,which is why i got you this pink power ranger. put it anywhere you like.
18898,Leonard,"what do you think about it, sheldon?"
18879,Leonard,what does your agent think?
15025,Leonard,"sure, sure. how did you get into this place?"
19097,Leonard,"okay. uh, i’ll, i’ll come get you. what’s the address?"
13483,Leonard,"okay, i have pokh."
12986,Leonard,but it would make the present so much nicer. 
15700,Leonard,"oh. well, good for you."
14743,Leonard,"no, there isn’t! they’re synonyms!"
12045,Leonard,great.
19823,Leonard,yeah. i’m excited to help.
20813,Leonard,cheers.
19613,Leonard,come on. sorry to bother you.
13198,Leonard,hey.
16403,Leonard,"– priya, can i come in?"
17753,Leonard,we’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?
20881,Leonard,"oh, i had a good dream that when i carried you to bed, i let your head hit the wall and i laughed."
12959,Leonard,snipe!
19148,Leonard,now you know why we’re not outside.
17034,Leonard,are you okay to drive?
14175,Leonard,"sheldon, it’s not that bad."
16364,Leonard,did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
14221,Leonard,sure. what does he like?
16408,Leonard,"i know. just do it. there’s a big inspection coming up, and i don’t want to lose my tv privileges."
16533,Leonard,there was one time i put body glitter on.
13388,Leonard,"that may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people."
21073,Leonard,"hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down."
21643,Leonard,"aw, screw the roommate agreement!"
17964,Leonard,why?
16670,Leonard,"well, you stay as long as you’d like."
15160,Leonard,"he’s not saying it’s a magic ring. you’re not, are you?"
12333,Leonard,and we all thank you.
18505,Leonard,what is that? what is that for?
17651,Leonard,"great topic. i can help with that. there are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political."
14363,Leonard,leonard?
15385,Leonard,no.
21583,Leonard,"hey penny, come on in."
17540,Leonard,this is ridiculous. are we gonna play cards or not?
14288,Leonard,"maybe, but i’m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try."
17424,Leonard,"no, it should be: why are you?"
18123,Leonard,nurse’s office.
20739,Leonard,not a lot. i just couldn’t start until you walked away.
20075,Leonard,"i wonder if that’s why i have such a dysfunctional relationship with sheldon. i had a dream the other night that i was in a cave and i was nursing a baby, but the baby had sheldon’s head on it."
20556,Leonard,once i found a stash of contracts under his bed. it was weird.
12104,Leonard,"wuh, i, i broke up with joyce kim."
16374,Leonard,that’s incredible.
15770,Leonard,"yeah, well,  sheldon’s still up."
18830,Leonard,are we playing individual or teams?
15313,Leonard,"d-don’t be silly. we’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it."
18496,Leonard,it’s called proving a point.
18960,Leonard,"he was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?"
19775,Leonard,"oh, sheldon, i’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist."
21473,Leonard,nice try. i’m not going.
16491,Leonard,"hi. hey, raj, will you be joining us for dinner?"
18239,Leonard,yeah.
15514,Leonard,"well, then what do you want us to do?"
20434,Leonard,maybe we should give them some privacy.
13154,Leonard,um… yes… i am… asking you out. 
21125,Leonard,"no, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. hello?"
13764,Leonard,since when?
15859,Leonard,"so, when howard said the fbi would be contacting me, i was expecting mulder. glad to see i got scully."
20689,Leonard,who do you think told koothrappali to go to human resources?
18554,Leonard,what?
20542,Leonard,"ready when you are, professor hawking."
17007,Leonard,"uh, stapled."
15350,Leonard,"look, it’s you."
15278,Leonard,i don’t know. why?
12679,Leonard,what? 
12880,Leonard,what did you spill on it?
18510,Leonard,what?
18137,Leonard,"how about it, sheldon?"
15930,Leonard,"i’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something."
16852,Leonard,"hey, priya."
20751,Leonard,"hey, penny, um, since you’re already gonna be at the airport, do i need to go?"
20807,Leonard,what is his hurry?
12777,Leonard,yes.
21388,Leonard,i don’t have a loofah.
13081,Leonard,"uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.  "
20792,Leonard,"oh, we have to use the stairs."
20281,Leonard,"really? how many grown-ups do you know who have mr. spock oven mitts? hey, the recipes are on my ipad. will you pull ’em up?"
18807,Leonard,we’re not.
15646,Leonard,hold on to that thought. 
19075,Leonard,seriously? you don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
13879,Leonard,he had lysine but changed it.
13834,Leonard,"run, monte, run!"
13516,Leonard,thank you.
12725,Leonard,i don’t know. how am i supposed to remember all of this.
20298,Leonard,"no, it doesn’t."
20228,Leonard,i promise this is the last time.
15976,Leonard,hey.
20821,Leonard,no.
15404,Leonard,leonard.
14569,Leonard,unbelievable.
12195,Leonard,it’s fine. you win.
12682,Leonard,skynet is kinky? i don’t know. 
15235,Leonard,good night.
21657,Leonard,"uh-oh, that’s priya."
20099,Leonard,"hey, watch your speed. i hear the mexican police target tourists."
17019,Leonard,i think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
15663,Leonard,why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
20445,Leonard,she meant emily.
12650,Leonard,"okay, i’m leaving for the conference. "
18293,Leonard,and no one told me?
19746,Leonard,"i’m about to lose control, and i think i like it."
18618,Leonard,what? that’s great. guys.
14609,Leonard,see? ruined.
19900,Leonard,"hey, look who’s here."
12478,Leonard,"okay, i understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. i mean, you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery. "
18198,Leonard,"hey, hey, hey, you can’t leave. we just started."
17384,Leonard,"so, come on, how was the first day with hawking?"
20284,Leonard,"let me see. yeah, there. what number were you putting in?"
20307,Leonard,"be right there. hi, lover."
20145,Leonard,what about a game of tag on a french schoolyard?
20880,Leonard,"it’s been three and a half minutes, wake up."
17757,Leonard,"oh, yeah? mummies are wrapped in bandages."
16385,Leonard,oh-oh.
17520,Leonard,what are you doing?
12147,Leonard,do you have any ideas?
12710,Leonard,oooaw. this would be so much easier if i were a violent sociopath.  what?
20960,Leonard,"exactly. learn from my mistakes. no matter where i am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby."
18780,Leonard,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. i’m gonna need more details."
13048,Leonard,"sheldon, can i talk to you in private?"
21241,Leonard,what’s going on with that woman you’re dating?
20164,Leonard,you’re just sweaty from exercise.
18800,Leonard,he’s afraid the original owners will come back.
16183,Leonard,what’s this?
19265,Leonard,you’re right.
18299,Leonard,"a tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science."
21750,Leonard,does that really need to be in the agreement?
17332,Leonard,we are going to play the online game.
13747,Leonard,okay. bye-bye! what are you looking at?you’ve never seen a hypocrite before?
18021,Leonard,glaringly obvious. go on.
13058,Leonard,"exactly. and, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring. "
21240,Leonard,"me, too."
12574,Leonard,hi! 
18387,Leonard,"yeah, i know."
12831,Leonard,yes sir. 
15062,Leonard,"sheldon, you got a minute?"
19977,Leonard,"mm, this one comes with music and flowers. oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the internet."
12948,Leonard,i don’t believe it.
13736,Leonard,"yeah, good for me. i’ll never have sex again.  i was wrong. see ya."
19009,Leonard,with your career?
20465,Leonard,"ha, ha. you married an old man. tell you what. let’s do something fun tonight."
17955,Leonard,i don’t care. i don’t have to do anything you say because i don’t think i want to live here anymore.
13116,Leonard,"okay, feel better, bye.  she doesn’t want to talk. "
19644,Leonard,yup.
20317,Leonard,it’s just an earworm. it’ll come to you.
20638,Leonard,why didn’t you tell me?
20149,Leonard,what?
21780,Leonard,oh. right.
19872,Leonard,"oh, thank you, but i’m okay."
14431,Leonard,glad we cleared that up.
14367,Leonard,howard’s space toilet. i’ll tell you later.
18961,Leonard,hmm?
19732,Leonard,we haven’t been on a road trip in a while. this is fun.
15862,Leonard,"good. it’s a good relationship. of course, most of my relationships are good. probably because i exude confidence. people are drawn to that, you know? confidence, not exuding."
17362,Leonard,ah!
13337,Leonard,"penny, you don’t have to do that."
16821,Leonard,you’re sure it’s not weird.
18052,Leonard,"yes, i know, you’re too smart for this."
18616,Leonard,absolutely.
15788,Leonard,"well, i’m just saying, i don’t have any real ties here, so if i were to move to new delhi we could, you know, go out."
14177,Leonard,shh-shh-shh!
14667,Leonard,another football game?
16772,Leonard,"please pester her. please, for me."
21010,Leonard,"you’re awful quiet, everything okay?"
21341,Leonard,we’re helping raj figure out his finances.
16516,Leonard,that’s not your water.
13185,Leonard,that might work too. 
20950,Leonard,"hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he’s gonna move back in here."
15067,Leonard,"yeah, well, i’ve been dreaming about spending valentine’s day with a girl since i was six."
14316,Leonard,"oh, hi."
14322,Leonard,"yeah, well i wouldn’t say cool, i’d just say, that’s leonard!"
19538,Leonard,he chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.
13481,Leonard,"sheldon? sheldon, are you okay?"
21089,Leonard,i think he might be learning on his own.
17918,Leonard,yep.
21538,Leonard,"oh, no. when?"
16546,Leonard,kill me.
15183,Leonard,"all right, it starts now."
21662,Leonard,"relax, he’s got headphones on. and we’re ten miles above earth in a starship."
16162,Leonard,what?
20761,Leonard,people do it all the time.
18924,Leonard,thank you.
18440,Leonard,come here.
20659,Leonard,you have fun. i will not be attending.
12911,Leonard,yes.
18190,Leonard,"i’ll, i’ll call for help."
18858,Leonard,"but if i get a chance to be a tenured professor, i might not have that much choice in where i end up."
18347,Leonard,no.
13688,Leonard,"so, go hit on her."
19641,Leonard,should we call howard and bernadette?
16839,Leonard,"oh, what the hell. i’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, alice, but i don’t know if i should, because i’m going out with priya, but she’s in india."
19100,Leonard,"sheldon, hang tight. hey, do you want me to bring anything?"
19466,Leonard,i can’t do that.
12584,Leonard,"i’m done, anybody else?"
14422,Leonard,it’s a blanket with sleeves.
20414,Leonard,"fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it’s okay, then yes, you can come."
12568,Leonard,i thought i heard something. 
13650,Leonard,you hacked my facebook account?
20120,Leonard,that helped.
14395,Leonard,yes.
15255,Leonard,i am not pushing anything.
15688,Leonard,"hmm, recently? not much."
13018,Leonard,"sheldon, are you okay? "
13071,Leonard,"well, since you’re leaving tomorrow i was wondering if you’d like to go out to dinner with me?"
21490,Leonard,hot dogs.
19447,Leonard,"what about when you flipped the mars rover, or lost koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?"
16241,Leonard,"what do you want to do? you want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?"
12967,Leonard,"oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs. "
18174,Leonard,"well, i can, so shut up."
21181,Leonard,yeah.
12615,Leonard,"sheldon, why is this letter in the trash? "
14118,Leonard,i’ve got a better idea.
16289,Leonard,"no, no-no-no, i’m ready! i gave up the gift of sight for you. if that’s not moving on, what is?"
17102,Leonard,"no, it’s not. always made it worse."
18831,Leonard,"oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?"
15683,Leonard,"no, no. maybe a little."
12977,Leonard,"okay, i am setting the dials for january 10th, 2328. here we go into the future.  that was fun. "
18663,Leonard,that is not what i said.
21727,Leonard,"oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. um, well, uh, original series over next generation, but picard over kirk."
18261,Leonard,keep your voice down.
17646,Leonard,it’s great. i love it.
13466,Leonard,seriously? you’re not coming?
16257,Leonard,it certainly is.
17026,Leonard,yes.
20062,Leonard,hey.
19349,Leonard,i thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
15519,Leonard,"yeah, yeah, great. howard, uh, slow down. what do you mean it happened again?"
12627,Leonard,"oh, you admit that it’s our work."
19551,Leonard,"no, no. people don’t talk about surface tension. if you imagine our three-space as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid bubble… this is exciting. this is really exciting. i have to go find sheldon."
12393,Leonard,oh yeah. but doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having?
16039,Leonard,can you say that and not make it sound like i’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
17348,Leonard,"raj, imperial troopers on your tail."
21495,Leonard,"i drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the hulk."
18350,Leonard,"okay, fine. do you want to know why i dressed like the hulk? because i was always mad at my mom and i wanted to smash my way out of that house."
12256,Leonard,"no, but you’re right. i should march over there and ask her out. "
16555,Leonard,"oh, yeah. mouth-to-mouth mona. you know, she used to date howard?"
12292,Leonard,nothing.
19701,Leonard,"look, i know shopping cheers you up, but it’s just not really my thing."
19854,Leonard,you let a guy sit on me.
12601,Leonard,"no, i’m leonard. "
13574,Leonard,so how was work today?
16138,Leonard,"yeah, it’s weird. even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard."
15318,Leonard,"no, i don’t want to do it. you can do it."
19779,Leonard,yes.
21330,Leonard,"i’m sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?"
20845,Leonard,so some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
12051,Leonard,in what universe?
18349,Leonard,that was to keep my muscles from sagging. can we please stop talking about this?
17137,Leonard,we are next to a suburu with a gore/lieberman bumper sticker.
13449,Leonard,"let’s go. okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is."
18110,Leonard,yeah. just thought i’d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.
12596,Leonard,what?
16642,Leonard,"okay. uh, uh, you’re not naughty. uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. you’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?"
12649,Leonard,what… . 
20621,Leonard,"to be fair, good at both."
19567,Leonard,"wow, it’s all happening so fast. should we just sleep on it?"
16068,Leonard,"okay, that’s it, you’re fired."
20719,Leonard,we’re leaving now!
20604,Leonard,you and i could still go and have a nice weekend.
18324,Leonard,call me a lady part. we’ll see about that.
12522,Leonard,"it’s up to you, crazy person’s choice. "
20235,Leonard,and what are you getting him back for?
17581,Leonard,it’ll be good to have him back.
14673,Leonard,"there’s no fooling you. now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?"
19080,Leonard,"oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting."
14394,Leonard,"howard, this is big science. you could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines."
17420,Leonard,"come on, please."
17710,Leonard,"oh, good, an english accent, the sexiest accent you can have."
15333,Leonard,come on. it’s just a cup of coffee.
14293,Leonard,suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.
18535,Leonard,"wait, you invited him here?"
12705,Leonard,and what would i have said afterwards? 
19669,Leonard,really?
16076,Leonard,you know what? go put on your bus pants.
16219,Leonard,why didn’t you call?
14830,Leonard,sheldon…
19730,Leonard,that soy frappuccino i had.
13452,Leonard,"on the other hand, i think sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton."
14604,Leonard,okay. howard come back.
15549,Leonard,no.
21339,Leonard,what brought that on?
15872,Leonard,"to tell you the truth, i thought if anyone was going to screw things up for howard, it’d be sheldon."
15449,Leonard,your company?
16225,Leonard,"i love the way you say, i’d love that."
14578,Leonard,"so, what’s going on with raj?"
15180,Leonard,"okay, now, this is ridiculous!"
20548,Leonard,"well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda."
19565,Leonard,this is good. our idea is really good.
14049,Leonard,you’re welcome.
21455,Leonard,she’s kidding.
18240,Leonard,"i know. as far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime."
19010,Leonard,like what?
19635,Leonard,in love yet?
12843,Leonard,you can’t let this kid get to you. you always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
16015,Leonard,"fine, if zack’s going to be superman, i want to be green lantern."
20856,Leonard,i saw it. it’s big.
20715,Leonard,"oh, i found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. it teaches the different flavour notes to look for."
17507,Leonard,"absolutely. you’re the girl, i’m the guy. now, you watch your football game while i make you a little plate here."
21471,Leonard,"no, it’s always him."
15642,Leonard,"hi, mrs. cooper. thanks for coming."
19387,Leonard,for the same reason i don’t wear the apron or the hair net.
18828,Leonard,"i don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, i’m sure you know what you’re doing."
15410,Leonard,that should have been my first clue.
13692,Leonard,are you sure?
13228,Leonard,"penny thinks i’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous. "
15807,Leonard,like what?
15259,Leonard,"yeah, i do."
19380,Leonard,"it sounds like either way, i finally get some rest."
15644,Leonard,"no, she’s real."
14113,Leonard,why do you have to give your paper to george smoot?
16319,Leonard,what’s up with the infrared cameras?
19003,Leonard,"what about when you did, uh, anne frank at that cute little theater?"
12248,Leonard,"ah. well, thank you for your time."
16163,Leonard,"excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. i’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, i received a dissertation of the year award for experimental particle physics."
18333,Leonard,why would you do that?
21694,Leonard,"ah, push it."
21186,Leonard,"by the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it."
19735,Leonard,i’m surprised you know that reference.
14126,Leonard,is that what he’s drinking? it’s not even real beer.
15982,Leonard,remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?
21167,Leonard,absolutely not.
15409,Leonard,you are so naive. just like i was seven years ago.  i’d just started at the university.
20068,Leonard,"never gets old. no, no, to a girl. anyway, i told her what happened between you and me, and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work."
16943,Leonard,laura.
13033,Leonard,"look, you’re here, we have plenty of room."
21767,Leonard,i like it.
14417,Leonard,"listen, i don’t know if i can go on the expedition."
14725,Leonard,the two aren’t mutually exclusive!
16147,Leonard,are you sure this is right?
15432,Leonard,"i did agree to the thermostat setting, and i shouldn’t have tried to change it."
14805,Leonard,"again, i’m right here."
13524,Leonard,norad? you’re using military aircraft?
15224,Leonard,you might want to check youtube.
17499,Leonard,"no occasion. you know, things have been a little weird between us, so i wanted to throw together a fun night just for you."
16819,Leonard,"i’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so i know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid."
20452,Leonard,"i’m sorry. you’re pretty, i’m stupid. hello. uh, just checking again for hofstadter. still gonna be an hour?"
17479,Leonard,"oh, wow."
14233,Leonard,"nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go."
17652,Leonard,can i take a look?
21633,Leonard,laser.
20001,Leonard,"yup, just want to get married."
19026,Leonard,this would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.
20397,Leonard,that sounds really fun.
20610,Leonard,i know. did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like colonial williamsburg.
13647,Leonard,what for?
15665,Leonard,yeah?
16468,Leonard,are you ashamed of me?
19379,Leonard,what’s your problem?
16564,Leonard,"bring a ball or a frisbee, you know, something he can chase."
14051,Leonard,"great, great. did you walk the whole way? it’s a little chilly."
17999,Leonard,"uh, where what is?"
18914,Leonard,"well, if he does, i’ll see if my bear has a friend."
20140,Leonard,what are you saying? we’re not coordinated enough to play sports?
20531,Leonard,"no offence, but i’ve known the guy a really long time."
14542,Leonard,"i’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
15592,Leonard,"i can figure this out, let’s see. um, well, beavers eat tree bark. the only tree bark i know that humans consume is cinnamon. so, i’ll say cinnamon."
18506,Leonard,"okay, sheldon, i am out of options. video store owner, nursis manookian, has no next of kin."
20195,Leonard,hey.
19744,Leonard,i don’t think george lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
21201,Leonard,"if you must know, penny won a spa weekend from work, and she’s taking me."
13476,Leonard,that only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the earth.
12973,Leonard,seconded. 
20658,Leonard,"i’m not going, you can’t make me."
19559,Leonard,i’m not a preschooler.
20254,Leonard,thank you.
14462,Leonard,"hey. listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, i didn’t have a chance to give you this."
14189,Leonard,"that is so great. oh, i’m leonard, i live downstairs. upstairs from here, but under you. not under you per se, but under your apartment."
12573,Leonard,hi.
20392,Leonard,"all right, here you go."
17016,Leonard,i don’t think something like that’s even possible.
19687,Leonard,what’s going on?
21639,Leonard,"hey, where’ve you been?"
16712,Leonard,"look, i know they have money. i don’t think it’s that much."
13528,Leonard,"oh, penny, you don’t want to get into it with sheldon. the guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain."
15762,Leonard,whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  okay.
12582,Leonard,so don’t call her.
17821,Leonard,"i grew up in a house full of crazy academics. instead of leaving santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. and in the morning, you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded."
16531,Leonard,i’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.
15757,Leonard,problem?
18492,Leonard,"you got it. if this sweater shuts you up, i’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. now all i need to do is head down to the video store and return the dvd."
14890,Leonard,"oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, i’ll get you a plate. mom, you remember penny."
12603,Leonard,"take it, raj. it’s more than i’ve ever gotten. "
13027,Leonard,"sheldon, are you going to introduce us? "
16668,Leonard,"i, i’m fine."
19045,Leonard,"now that penny and i are engaged, i thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements."
3870,Bernadette,"yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group."
5332,Bernadette,"oh, you get used to it. some guys you have to turn down over and over."
5459,Bernadette,why can’t it be a woman cave?
5072,Bernadette,what?
4310,Bernadette,what thing?
3781,Bernadette,that’s what i hear.
4747,Bernadette,"raj, your tag’s sticking out."
5440,Bernadette,"we don’t want to spoil anything, but you should know that sheldon said he’s ready to be physical."
5124,Bernadette,here we go.
5218,Bernadette,he did it with a robot.
5170,Bernadette,it’s okay. it’s just food.
4626,Bernadette,"hey. howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. now, both of you apologize right now."
3771,Bernadette,"amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before."
3939,Bernadette,"come back in, sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you. he looks friendly. i think he might be someone’s pet."
4982,Bernadette,i’m so sorry i made you feel bad about the money stuff.
4473,Bernadette,"don’t well me, mister. we’ve been worried sick. she could have been dead for all we knew. you should be ashamed of yourself."
5018,Bernadette,i like cinderella.
4503,Bernadette,sorry. i have no point. that was a stupid thing to say. can we please just go back to having a nice time?
3956,Bernadette,"oh, my god, that’s awful."
4299,Bernadette,sheldon doesn’t have a spot.
3584,Bernadette,"well, to be honest, i…"
4248,Bernadette,i just can’t believe you could keep something like that from him.
3986,Bernadette,here’s your vest back.
4977,Bernadette,"well, don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance."
4451,Bernadette,"well, there was action, it was funny. i mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?"
4644,Bernadette,what presentation do i have today?
4497,Bernadette,you’re right. thank you.
5246,Bernadette,"we talked about this. i don’t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. and rule number one is pants."
3712,Bernadette,sure.
3622,Bernadette,i thought it was pretty spicy. especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.
3777,Bernadette,it doesn’t matter. i’m going to tell her we can’t make it.
6051,Bernadette,"yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production."
6009,Bernadette,"plus, i, i think i’m setting a good example for halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. sure, she won’t know where i went or if i’m ever coming back. that’ll just make the ten minutes between when i get home and her bedtime even more special."
6141,Bernadette,hey.
3605,Bernadette,"joy, this is leonard. leonard, this is joy."
4459,Bernadette,"yeah. i never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, i felt like maybe someday we could do it."
4934,Bernadette,"howard, you know we’re saving up for a house."
4859,Bernadette,i’ll pay you anything you want.
3509,Bernadette,call me when you figure it out.
4979,Bernadette,money’s a sensitive subject for howie because of the difference in our income.
4418,Bernadette,show him the closet.
4559,Bernadette,howard.
4742,Bernadette,"yeah, it’s fun up here."
4034,Bernadette,"so the thing to watch for, if he’s shouting at you, you’re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there."
4240,Bernadette,"i love you, too."
4426,Bernadette,why don’t you read it? maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
4702,Bernadette,"oh, i know. there’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea."
5043,Bernadette,"okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea."
4486,Bernadette,"you know, one of the things that helped me get through howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left."
6099,Bernadette,"that’s nothing, howie said she touched his hand."
5758,Bernadette,"god, raj."
4607,Bernadette,i’d save that for the second date.
5288,Bernadette,"oh, i don’t know. this is all so new to me. i’m still processing."
5421,Bernadette,oh. that’s a big step.
4431,Bernadette,"me, too, but i guess now we’ll never know."
4855,Bernadette,"thanks. little warning before you jump into this marriage business. you’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family."
5096,Bernadette,"wow, you really do love her."
4856,Bernadette,"it doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. the question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? hit me again."
5208,Bernadette,"hey, raj."
5541,Bernadette,"me, too."
5997,Bernadette,"yeah, i wish i had that with howard."
4765,Bernadette,"so, what happens next?"
5831,Bernadette,"while you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher."
4893,Bernadette,want to stop here?
5315,Bernadette,of course.
4358,Bernadette,"then by the transitive property of picking things up, hulk picked up the hammer."
3879,Bernadette,howard.
3604,Bernadette,"we never did. that would be a terrible, terrible thing."
3701,Bernadette,that’s how i take it.
5688,Bernadette,this guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.
5742,Bernadette,"well, you’re not, so just drop it.  i’m clearly upset. why aren’t you following me?"
4177,Bernadette,why don’t you stand up to them?
5413,Bernadette,"oh, great. we’d love to help."
5609,Bernadette,i can’t tell anymore.
3881,Bernadette,okay.
4631,Bernadette,howie. 
6132,Bernadette,"no, it’s not!"
5542,Bernadette,"i appreciate this, but you really…"
5900,Bernadette,"yeah, go ahead."
5177,Bernadette,did she throw anything away?
5401,Bernadette,right here.
5543,Bernadette,what kind of cake do you like?
5073,Bernadette,who’s been paying for my coffee?
6122,Bernadette,it was an architect!
5723,Bernadette,you shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday.
3585,Bernadette,i’m okay.
4938,Bernadette,"okay, let’s get down to business. howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, i have a few questions."
6048,Bernadette,you realize they called when you took her.
5173,Bernadette,"there’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there."
4554,Bernadette,"yeah, i bet it sucked. i’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes."
3907,Bernadette,"oh, my god, howard! what did you do?"
4641,Bernadette,aw! raj did the dishes.
4231,Bernadette,"thanks, so do you. slutty cop?"
5579,Bernadette,i feel bad. should we have asked him to stay?
5939,Bernadette,you’re upset i had a baby?
5768,Bernadette,but it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us.
5860,Bernadette,not that old school. he knows.
5959,Bernadette,what is it?
3527,Bernadette,i’ve been meaning to go over there.
4073,Bernadette,"so, arranged marriages. the parents just decide, and then you have to get married?"
4027,Bernadette,"i don’t know, i don’t want to manipulate him with sex."
5281,Bernadette,think they’ll break up?
4514,Bernadette,"fine, forget i asked. how was dinner at your mom’s?"
6037,Bernadette,"yeah, eventually. she’s still not happy about taking a bottle, though."
3737,Bernadette,we were hoping you’d know a place.
3489,Bernadette,are you going to answer it?
4226,Bernadette,"uh-oh, is someone a little blue? come on, howie, that’s like the funniest thing i’ve ever said in my life. what do you say? you ready to go?"
4515,Bernadette,why can’t she do it?
4054,Bernadette,do you sleep in tents?
5865,Bernadette,raj.
4597,Bernadette,why? what are you gonna say?
5380,Bernadette,"okay, i’ll think about it."
5193,Bernadette,how is that fair? you grew up with a table.
3668,Bernadette,no. he was one of my professors in college.
5624,Bernadette,of course.
4990,Bernadette,"i was kind of excited about the article, but now you’re making me feel bad."
5247,Bernadette,"guys. in the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, i got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank."
5946,Bernadette,that’s so sweet of you.
4511,Bernadette,"hi, honey."
4401,Bernadette,"well, it’s simple. this was my idea. i’m driving. i’m cinderella. you bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now."
3731,Bernadette,i can’t believe this.
3599,Bernadette,"me, too."
5227,Bernadette,i’m sorry. what do we know?
4352,Bernadette,no.
3607,Bernadette,i’ll go with you.
5949,Bernadette,is it really that high?
4215,Bernadette,i just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.
3886,Bernadette,"oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!"
3554,Bernadette,"no, leonard, you should hear this."
5139,Bernadette,"i understand why you’re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. and it’s just furniture."
3850,Bernadette,"raj, take me home."
3739,Bernadette,"pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?"
4723,Bernadette,"guys, you’re being childish."
5481,Bernadette,absolutely.
3819,Bernadette,"come on, howard, i’m going to be your wife. you can share anything with me."
5091,Bernadette,"yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that."
4108,Bernadette,you’re kidding.
4506,Bernadette,good night.
5317,Bernadette,"so, i’m your seventh choice."
4902,Bernadette,i’ll let you know.
4476,Bernadette,"no husbands, no boyfriends, no rules."
5789,Bernadette,"yeah, he deserves to be alone."
5294,Bernadette,you guys still aren’t living together?
6072,Bernadette,"don’t listen to her, she’s been in a box for, like, 25 years.  yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable."
4711,Bernadette,are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to napa? you could probably still get a room.
5408,Bernadette,"the soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours."
4316,Bernadette,so you’ve just been lying to him?
4539,Bernadette,how do i put this? she’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. or a cat. or a willow.
5483,Bernadette,"no, you didn’t."
5809,Bernadette,i was hoping it’d be quieter.
4266,Bernadette,"howie, you promised you’d move."
6087,Bernadette,you have to go.
5564,Bernadette,sure.
3999,Bernadette,when did you and leonard break up?
4044,Bernadette,"good night, real penny."
4087,Bernadette,"amy, please."
3689,Bernadette,don’t you listen to them. you’ve got plenty of sex appeal.
4984,Bernadette,"now, let’s talk about your birthday party."
4311,Bernadette,"oh, that thing. no, i cancelled that thing."
4782,Bernadette,“lol.” smiley face.
4439,Bernadette,what are you looking at?
5348,Bernadette,"yeah, stuart got two dates with it."
6080,Bernadette,you might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.
3529,Bernadette,"me neither, but he just lights up when i laugh."
6153,Bernadette,"oh, it’s raj. everything okay?"
5265,Bernadette,don’t let that sway you.
4973,Bernadette,how much?
4594,Bernadette,"cool. at my lab, i performed ten laser capture micro-dissections."
4198,Bernadette,"howie, stop that. nasa’s watching this! put your pants back on!"
5306,Bernadette,what about your sister’s wedding?
4803,Bernadette,"so, emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?"
5680,Bernadette,"love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off."
4313,Bernadette,"okay, amy, i brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. this is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts."
3714,Bernadette,"no, it’s not great. you need to make a choice. me or your mother."
3915,Bernadette,that’s horrible.
3662,Bernadette,"oh, my god, glenn!"
4927,Bernadette,"oh, i know. why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?"
5129,Bernadette,but they didn’t even kiss.
4825,Bernadette,son of a bitch.
5984,Bernadette,where would he stay? we already have stuart.
5854,Bernadette,please just go to the store.
4122,Bernadette,"come on, howard. i’m not falling for that again."
3575,Bernadette,"thanks, sheldon."
4708,Bernadette,"honestly, i thought when i got married i would, but i still kind of feel like i’m pretending. it doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from gap kids."
4468,Bernadette,can’t believe we lost her. what was i thinking? i’d be a terrible mom.
4945,Bernadette,"i think after this, i’ll be dead."
6071,Bernadette,"sorry, you’re not a dork.  look at him, what reason he got to feel good?"
3954,Bernadette,"worst part was, it was too big."
5904,Bernadette,"yeah, thanks."
6008,Bernadette,and that day care is great.
4870,Bernadette,"oh, i understand. you want to do something you’re already good at. i know. why don’t i get you a job at the sitting around all day wearing yoga pants factory?"
3618,Bernadette,you know what i really love about howard? his chest hair.
3713,Bernadette,"that’s it? that’s your big solution to all of our problems? if your mom’s nose holds up, we get two nights together?"
3677,Bernadette,"wait a minute, a girl like me? what’s that mean?"
5996,Bernadette,jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?
4983,Bernadette,"no, it’s not okay. i want us to be partners, equals. adults in a mature relationship."
3691,Bernadette,i have to stay here for school.
4959,Bernadette,aren’t you gonna chase her?
5672,Bernadette,do not pull over. i’m not raising this baby alone.
5273,Bernadette,"howard, do something."
4600,Bernadette,"we did, you never brought it."
4081,Bernadette,why are you doing that? you’re being mean to him.
4163,Bernadette,"so, you actually see you and sheldon getting married someday?"
5501,Bernadette,are you okay?
4704,Bernadette,i can’t believe the waiter thought i was your daughter.
4812,Bernadette,"between penny’s gorilla movie and howard’s gorilla mother, i had no choice."
4606,Bernadette,"maybe, if she asks."
5584,Bernadette,go hide.
3861,Bernadette,it’s me.
5660,Bernadette,but we did get to see a live stream of it on the internet.
5678,Bernadette,we’re here today to celebrate love.
4649,Bernadette,"like i don’t do enough around here. now i need to pack your lunch? and by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ’em? you’re a grown man, you should know to go get ’em."
5520,Bernadette,"yeah, it’s all real exciting."
3935,Bernadette,i love it!
6004,Bernadette,already cleared the browser history.
4196,Bernadette,"howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you’re having a little anxiety."
4586,Bernadette,"howie, that was amazing. look, i’m shaking."
3852,Bernadette,hey. i don’t want to fight. i was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
4861,Bernadette,"so, she’s not too much for you?"
3678,Bernadette,are you saying you don’t think i’m hot enough to go out with a guy like glenn?
5873,Bernadette,"i didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a milky way or a snickers girl?"
4254,Bernadette,"every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes."
3476,Bernadette,"yeah, exciting. can i ask you something?"
6012,Bernadette,"stuart, you didn’t have to make dinner."
3674,Bernadette,"howard, it’s not a contest. i love you. i want to be with you."
5047,Bernadette,"oh, that’s so sweet. i want to do that."
5341,Bernadette,why does your fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
4633,Bernadette,no.
5726,Bernadette,i get enough of that when i take howard to my grandmother’s for christmas.
4241,Bernadette,"hey, what you watching?"
5869,Bernadette,did she have a middle name?
5509,Bernadette,morning.
3759,Bernadette,i will. i will!
4072,Bernadette,the nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. they used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.
4739,Bernadette,daddy.
4415,Bernadette,"oh, it’s my pleasure."
4819,Bernadette,"not me. i got into science ’cause i was always the smallest kid in school, so i thought if i became a scientist, i could invent a formula that made me taller."
5121,Bernadette,please?
5137,Bernadette,howie.
5978,Bernadette,what’s the difference?
6061,Bernadette,and i’d like to think howie wouldn’t take a job i was uncomfortable with.
4400,Bernadette,we can’t all be cinderella.
4103,Bernadette,"i heard. your voice, not unlike your mother’s, travels through walls."
4790,Bernadette,were you seeing other women when we started dating?
5377,Bernadette,"turns out yeah, i didn’t think twice about it."
4380,Bernadette,they do look happy.
5648,Bernadette,"okay, i guess i should eat the hell prawn."
5254,Bernadette,"i think if raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it."
5987,Bernadette,"it’s fine. it’s just raj. you can hit him with the bat, but it’s fine."
4411,Bernadette,fine. but after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.
4648,Bernadette,"oh, really?"
5063,Bernadette,where? to babies r us?
5652,Bernadette,i might just take you up on that.
3736,Bernadette,sure.
5175,Bernadette,i love that.
3473,Bernadette,that works.
3631,Bernadette,knock-knock.
5955,Bernadette,okay.
6040,Bernadette,"well, guess i’m ready to go."
5891,Bernadette,how can she hate me? i make her food in my chest. it’s like hating a frozen yogurt machine.
6035,Bernadette,"well, sloth babies cling to their mothers’ bodies for almost a year. i’m going back to work after only four months, so i’ve learned i hate myself, i hate sloths, and i hate you for bringing me here."
4525,Bernadette,"faster, faster, faster! do you not know that word? it means more fast!"
3565,Bernadette,"oh, my god, have you ever been so embarrassed?"
4077,Bernadette,not necessarily. i think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with. 
5164,Bernadette,not a chance.
3499,Bernadette,"okay, but only if you come to sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke."
3863,Bernadette,"yeah, i guess. we’re very different people, howard, so communication’s a little tricky."
3857,Bernadette,okay.
4744,Bernadette,"no, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups."
5411,Bernadette,oh. okay. wipe that smug smile off your face.
4564,Bernadette,he said what?
5626,Bernadette,"gee, sheldon, i don’t know."
4681,Bernadette,hey stuart.
5318,Bernadette,how can i help you?
3515,Bernadette,"howard, we’ve only been on three dates. we haven’t even had sex yet."
6065,Bernadette,why?
5388,Bernadette,"hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?"
4015,Bernadette,"oh, smells amazing in here."
4059,Bernadette,"well, is there anything i could do to help?"
4509,Bernadette,"oh, good, ’cause i liked the tall thin one. he seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like i’d have to teach him a thing or two."
4479,Bernadette,that’s an excellent question. amy?
4890,Bernadette,"well, don’t worry, everything’s back to normal."
3518,Bernadette,"oh, now what?"
5245,Bernadette,stuart.
4653,Bernadette,i back you up all the time.
4889,Bernadette,"i was probably being too hard on her. we talked, we’re good."
5859,Bernadette,i’m sorry. it’s our first time.
3929,Bernadette,"we know you’re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a second chance to make things right."
4481,Bernadette,i say we attack the big one.
5562,Bernadette,"well, i should hope so. the whole thing was your idea."
3491,Bernadette,"oh, yeah? does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?"
5142,Bernadette,can you please just let it go?
5755,Bernadette,are we being silly not finding out the sex?
4188,Bernadette,"really, you’re serious? okay. "
4341,Bernadette,"i don’t mind it. i think howie’s just in touch with his inner child. although when he comes to bed in his batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like i’m touching his inner child."
5161,Bernadette,"well, maybe this is what you get for snooping."
5827,Bernadette,last question. what is wrong with you?
5230,Bernadette,"you better not change, because i love who you are. now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?"
3632,Bernadette,so where’s the telescope?
6089,Bernadette,"oh, great."
5263,Bernadette,right.
6001,Bernadette,hey.
3696,Bernadette,sexually.
4268,Bernadette,i know this wasn’t easy. you doing okay?
4793,Bernadette,"the one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. so, you know, silver linings."
5484,Bernadette,"well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause i love how things worked out."
3900,Bernadette,all right. i just wanted to tell you i’m sorry i said something to your mother.
3724,Bernadette,what?
4774,Bernadette,i liked the time travel element.
4242,Bernadette,"so, i was taking a shower this morning, and when i got out, i started to dry off with what i thought was a towel but turned out to be howard’s mom’s underwear. i had to take another shower. it wasn’t enough. nothing will ever be enough."
5986,Bernadette,"not for you, box of towels."
5829,Bernadette,"okay, call him and show him. i dare you."
6055,Bernadette,"yes, i’m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now."
3864,Bernadette,it’s butter-flavoured syrup.
5633,Bernadette,yeah.
5390,Bernadette,"yeah, but i’m little, so it’s adorable."
4677,Bernadette,"no, of course not."
5436,Bernadette,wild thang.
5683,Bernadette,"thank you. all right, let’s continue."
3502,Bernadette,where do you think this is going?
5535,Bernadette,"i’m sorry, but you know what it’s like when you’re with your man and one thing leads to another."
4135,Bernadette,"oh, no."
4826,Bernadette,almost there. you’re doing great.
4981,Bernadette,i’ll be right back. i’m gonna go check on him.
4109,Bernadette,"oh, you’re in a good mood."
5040,Bernadette,so there are things you don’t like.
3977,Bernadette,do you know how to pipe down?
5244,Bernadette,maybe you shouldn’t be flying it inside.
6045,Bernadette,"i see a wall, floor, some asian baby, there she is."
3793,Bernadette,i suppose i could get them back to talking about leonard going to india to meet priya’s parents.
4847,Bernadette,"she’s just so impossible, they keep quitting."
3644,Bernadette,"he’s taking a turn to the dark side, isn’t he?"
4262,Bernadette,kitchen slammed again?
3867,Bernadette,"if you want butter, i’ll get you butter."
3566,Bernadette,"i don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing."
4265,Bernadette,that might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.
4787,Bernadette,are you gonna take it?
4801,Bernadette,please don’t say it.
4471,Bernadette,"hang on, you’ve had her for hours?"
4365,Bernadette,"at any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?"
5268,Bernadette,yeah.
3894,Bernadette,i don’t know what i’m going to do. i don’t want to break up over this.
5314,Bernadette,the breakfast meat family?
4860,Bernadette,i could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.
5022,Bernadette,"so, you knew and you brought her anyway?"
5284,Bernadette,"i’m mad at you for blabbing to me what leonard did on the north sea, and i’m mad that i’ve had to hide this from penny for two years."
5855,Bernadette,take raj. stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.
3767,Bernadette,"oh, i totally want to see sheldon dance. i bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate."
4343,Bernadette,"i mean, it’s such an important part of their lives. maybe we should try reading some."
5423,Bernadette,you sure? you’ve never really been with a man. do you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?
5344,Bernadette,he’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.
4735,Bernadette,"no, i think it’s stupid."
5235,Bernadette,how about now?
4707,Bernadette,i could go for a drink.
4375,Bernadette,"maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, i’d tell you."
5651,Bernadette,"well, thanks again."
5902,Bernadette,"we love you, too."
4185,Bernadette,"well, hang in there. you just have a couple more days to go, and then you’ll be home."
4408,Bernadette,you can’t just throw everything in the closet.
4141,Bernadette,"great, well, who’s it going to be?"
5271,Bernadette,howard.
4632,Bernadette,the rest of the week? you said it was just gonna be a night or two.
5825,Bernadette,where did you get that?
3561,Bernadette,i’m sliding into third.
3885,Bernadette,"howard, my father was a police officer. we never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. it was horrible. and i don’t want to live that way with you."
5356,Bernadette,"i, i thought you weren’t ready to start seeing people."
5502,Bernadette,"oh. well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?"
3978,Bernadette,you got wax in your ears? the man said it’s an ordinary pitcher. howdini.
4166,Bernadette,but do you think you’ll ever get married?
5293,Bernadette,i hope the boys don’t get too crazy in mexico.
3519,Bernadette,"no, that’s okay."
3747,Bernadette,oh. that bitch!
5366,Bernadette,let’s just redo one room and see how it goes.
5576,Bernadette,it is crazy. it’s also crazy that i’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three.
3821,Bernadette,you mean sexual intercourse?
5574,Bernadette,sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. it’s like a beer commercial.
6115,Bernadette,let me just put that on vibrate.
5242,Bernadette,four hours of our lives gone? check.
6108,Bernadette,"that’s ridiculous. as far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch."
5123,Bernadette,"wow, even in your fantasies sheldon’s kind of exhausting."
5546,Bernadette,yeah.
3987,Bernadette,where?
5456,Bernadette,goodbye.
3941,Bernadette,"look how sweet he is. come over and say hi. come on. you can do it. don’t be scared. come on. oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!"
5008,Bernadette,"my prom was pretty terrible, too. i was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend. he spent the whole night talking about her."
5637,Bernadette,"that’s lovely, sheldon."
5478,Bernadette,"oh. well, i guess that’s not so bad."
5785,Bernadette,what?
5630,Bernadette,there’s more than one?
3814,Bernadette,yeah. we’re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.
4689,Bernadette,"oh, that’s great."
6152,Bernadette,"okay. thanks, daddy. he said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing."
4766,Bernadette,i didn’t know you were fat.
3661,Bernadette,"don’t worry, penny. this is a better car anyway."
5319,Bernadette,"well, why don’t you look at this as an opportunity? you had other roommates before leonard. maybe this is a chance to find someone new."
3621,Bernadette,um.
5185,Bernadette,"good news, i found more tums."
4097,Bernadette,"when i first met howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother."
5386,Bernadette,tea and basketball?
4642,Bernadette,"because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys."
4292,Bernadette,"didn’t see that one coming, did ya?"
5328,Bernadette,you are.
5993,Bernadette,"well, are you worried he’s like another man in her life?"
5339,Bernadette,walk.
5608,Bernadette,yeah.
5960,Bernadette,it’s so hard to say no to you.
4873,Bernadette,howie?
5075,Bernadette,yeah?
5642,Bernadette,oh. i like the idea of being tall.
6088,Bernadette,"i’m telling you, if you don’t go you’ll end up regretting it."
3645,Bernadette,"oh, you poor, poor thing. raj, you have to know you’re a wonderful man. there are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you."
4836,Bernadette,"come on. the constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. we’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own."
5445,Bernadette,it was. i just wish stuart wasn’t around so we didn’t have to be so quiet.
5529,Bernadette,"well, we didn’t exactly decide. we were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless."
5703,Bernadette,what kind of revenge is that? this woman screwed with my job. she’s got to pay.
4228,Bernadette,"no, if i’m there alone, people might think i’m just a really short person from avatar."
4213,Bernadette,"nice try, but you have to go to that party because we’re going."
4908,Bernadette,throw the damn ball!
4314,Bernadette,this is a really good expectorant. although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.
4845,Bernadette,"me, too."
4489,Bernadette,are you referring to the time we got stuck on the small world ride at disneyland?
4799,Bernadette,"emily, what do you do?"
4102,Bernadette,howie?
5505,Bernadette,"if you’re really worried, we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested."
4840,Bernadette,they only had regular yoghurt. i had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.
4246,Bernadette,that’s great. i didn’t know you wanted to go back to school.
5420,Bernadette,okay. so where’s he taking you?
3504,Bernadette,"actually, i think a lot of them are jewish."
5441,Bernadette,"well, we’re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…"
5715,Bernadette,got a minute?
3756,Bernadette,"howard, let me just stop you right here."
4778,Bernadette,"okay, well, i did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell."
3703,Bernadette,oh! already? why don’t you stay over?
5856,Bernadette,i think i’m in labour.
5851,Bernadette,"yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras."
3541,Bernadette,do they have that?
4175,Bernadette,"no, what are they doing?"
5154,Bernadette,"you better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another, w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman."
5447,Bernadette,"so, when are you thinking of moving?"
4921,Bernadette,you guys just met. why would she feel that way?
4660,Bernadette,"hey, penny, can i take that table?"
5166,Bernadette,"well, it’ll be good that you’re there. howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go."
4783,Bernadette,“p.s. good luck wherever you wind up.”
5350,Bernadette,"hey, i thought you were gonna be out late?"
5985,Bernadette,that sounds awful.
4095,Bernadette,"zip it, pervert!"
5020,Bernadette,what?
5299,Bernadette,your hair?
3849,Bernadette,"i’m not gonna live with your mother. not now, not ever."
4327,Bernadette,"oh, here he comes."
5888,Bernadette,"no they’re not, you bozo. how come stuart can get her to stop crying, but i can’t?"
4963,Bernadette,i like your suit.
4918,Bernadette,"you know, penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. maybe she can practice on you some time."
3955,Bernadette,what about you?
5028,Bernadette,they’re yours in the divorce.
5681,Bernadette,howard.
5782,Bernadette,"i meant like, what are you doing here?"
4467,Bernadette,it turns you on when i sound like raj?
3875,Bernadette,i always catch your drift.
4136,Bernadette,i can’t believe we’re not going to get married.
5360,Bernadette,we need to talk about redecorating this place.
3728,Bernadette,wait a second. i’m doing your laundry?
4013,Bernadette,what about me and howard?
4124,Bernadette,"oh, my god."
4470,Bernadette,"oh, thank god she’s okay."
4513,Bernadette,"we are. stop it. and for the last time, you’re not fat."
3822,Bernadette,howard’s mother had a heart attack because i have sex with him and she can’t.
5094,Bernadette,what about that sweater?
6097,Bernadette,i made us have a baby.
4061,Bernadette,"i’m here to help you get through this. you can’t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you."
5283,Bernadette,what will pay for itself?
5024,Bernadette,"howie, get off of him."
5349,Bernadette,doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?
5119,Bernadette,"sorry, i had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training."
3505,Bernadette,"look, howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means."
5625,Bernadette,me? how? why?
5345,Bernadette,"i don’t know. stuart, can you come in here? he tried to explain it to me. it shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game."
3484,Bernadette,like in the bedroom or like dungeons and dragons?
4260,Bernadette,thank you.
5357,Bernadette,and how many guys have you gone out with?
4453,Bernadette,"well, sure. i’m pretty passionate about science. i remember the first time i looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. it was like a whole other universe. if i wanted to, i could wipe it out with my thumb like a god."
3873,Bernadette,are those russian rockets safe?
3595,Bernadette,"well, whose fault was that?"
5938,Bernadette,i’m not sad. i just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.
5972,Bernadette,"if he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over."
3934,Bernadette,i am the bride.
4252,Bernadette,"no, no!"
4195,Bernadette,okay.
4931,Bernadette,i know.
3579,Bernadette,what’s george takei doing here?
5819,Bernadette,i’m running out of ways to act excited.
3665,Bernadette,i’ll try to catch it.
3580,Bernadette,she’s leaving because you really want to be with me.
4272,Bernadette,"aw, crap. let’s go."
3948,Bernadette,"well, yeah, i guess they’re not engaged like me and howie."
4086,Bernadette,"um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. this is a map of pasadena. this is a list of local restaurants. and then, for howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation."
4204,Bernadette,"no, i told them they could have you tomorrow night. tonight, you belong to me.  "
4697,Bernadette,"yes, i am, there’s a few more things i want to say to you. stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, i’d like to buy it right now."
4234,Bernadette,"you, out! you are being very rude."
5308,Bernadette,"that’s a joke, right?"
4269,Bernadette,"aw, she’ll be okay. she’s a grown woman."
5379,Bernadette,why?
5198,Bernadette,"well, if you can switch champions, so can i. i want raj."
5970,Bernadette,i appreciate it.
3552,Bernadette,what are you doing here?
3787,Bernadette,"you’ve met lots of astronauts, and i’ve never grilled you about that. i’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy."
5229,Bernadette,i was kidding. of course you are.
3845,Bernadette,that’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.
4910,Bernadette,okay.
5999,Bernadette,"you’re entitled to feel how you feel. if you don’t like it, you should just talk to her."
4083,Bernadette,it’s not the same thing. sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.
3899,Bernadette,can we talk?
5668,Bernadette,are you done with this nonsense?
5102,Bernadette,"you know, worrying won’t have any effect on what happens."
4680,Bernadette,so am i.
4850,Bernadette,that’s not helpful.
5796,Bernadette,"i warned you, and i did it."
4714,Bernadette,great. now there’s two of ’em.
4030,Bernadette,"i don’t know. my dad’s pretty insistent on it, though."
3843,Bernadette,it’s okay if he wants to come.
5167,Bernadette,is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?
3966,Bernadette,i don’t feel good about this.
3639,Bernadette,which is still so funny.
3617,Bernadette,"oh, you never were?"
3539,Bernadette,"boy, i’d love to see that."
4954,Bernadette,"oh, i’m so sorry."
5639,Bernadette,"okay, but just for a little bit."
4362,Bernadette,were they expensive?
4512,Bernadette,i made some brownies. you want one?
3961,Bernadette,every other week i serve at a soup kitchen downtown.
4450,Bernadette,walk.
5331,Bernadette,stuart took that rejection like a pro.
4383,Bernadette,"love you, too."
4284,Bernadette,"gosh, amy. i’m sensing a little hostility. is it maybe because, like sheldon’s work, your sex life is also theoretical?"
4032,Bernadette,"i should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. even though he’s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. but don’t worry, he won’t shoot it. it’s more of a fashion statement."
3865,Bernadette,he wants butter!
4167,Bernadette,it doesn’t sound like it.
3524,Bernadette,he can’t sit somewhere else?
4817,Bernadette,this is pretty cool. you don’t see too many spherical cakes.
5675,Bernadette,"yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house."
3680,Bernadette,can i stay here tonight?
4180,Bernadette,"oh, sure, you had no choice."
4218,Bernadette,"yeah, you mentioned it once or twice."
3664,Bernadette,"oh, good for you. uh, glenn, this is my boyfriend howard."
4764,Bernadette,what do you care? you’re dead.
5093,Bernadette,so your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
5533,Bernadette,kind of on sheldon’s bed.
5165,Bernadette,"howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. who cares?"
4189,Bernadette,"hey, i wasn’t expecting to hear from you today. everything okay?"
5896,Bernadette,down here.
4259,Bernadette,"do you? you said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here."
4603,Bernadette,"if this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?"
3557,Bernadette,"raj, you should’ve seen leonard’s experiment. the interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on."
4717,Bernadette,"so, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. most of them are. i mean, look at this guy. you think he came like this? when i met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. now, he’s been to space. that’s all me."
3653,Bernadette,it’s what i do with howard. i’m much smarter than he is. but it’s important to protect his manhood.
4391,Bernadette,"why don’t you take her to disneyland? you go on space mountain, you’re in the dark, she’s holding onto you."
3841,Bernadette,what?!
3744,Bernadette,that’s kind of creepy.
4534,Bernadette,"congratulations, you got it last. "
5516,Bernadette,"i don’t know, howie."
6059,Bernadette,i would never let howard work with an ex.
5466,Bernadette,"and he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple."
3982,Bernadette,"the thing is, my mother worked full-time. i had to take care of my brothers and sisters."
3766,Bernadette,that doesn’t count. aren’t you even a little curious?
5101,Bernadette,"all i have is our new urine flow drug. won’t help with his anxiety, but it’s so strong, when he pees he’ll fly around the room like he’s got a jet pack."
4757,Bernadette,i did. his talk at nasa went great.
4839,Bernadette,sorry.
5699,Bernadette,fell asleep?
3995,Bernadette,ooh!
5322,Bernadette,"well, sheldon’s looking for a roommate."
4968,Bernadette,"sure, sometimes. i mean, it can be a little awkward since i make so much more money than howie."
3931,Bernadette,"no. i, i want you to be the maid of honour."
4407,Bernadette,what you doing?
6081,Bernadette,really? that’s the importance you put on us having a baby?
5182,Bernadette,"no, we got it. you guys make yourselves comfortable."
4848,Bernadette,you guys propose all the time. this never happens.
5085,Bernadette,maybe you’d like it more if you thought of santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
4760,Bernadette,"well, i told howie if i wasn’t busy, i’d spend the night at his mom’s. so for god’s sake, think of something."
4570,Bernadette,like looking me in the eye and lying to me?
5990,Bernadette,"just not in our bedroom, you dumbass. "
5961,Bernadette,so i’ll say maybe.
5100,Bernadette,what’s he talking about?
4991,Bernadette,"it was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article."
5160,Bernadette,aw. i’m gonna miss her.
4321,Bernadette,no!
3882,Bernadette,"well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process."
3498,Bernadette,why?
6007,Bernadette,"yeah, i mean, with you and my parents, she’s gonna be fine."
5664,Bernadette,"well, it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for leonard’s mother."
4338,Bernadette,he’s not exhausting at all.
5878,Bernadette,really? so you can control it?
4619,Bernadette,what?
5464,Bernadette,hmm. maybe he’s busy.
3880,Bernadette,"yeah, i get it. i just wish you included me in the decision. we’re supposed to be partners. we’re supposed to be a team."
4353,Bernadette,let’s read it again.
3799,Bernadette,let me help you.
5435,Bernadette,"hold on. it could be romantic. the two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy wisconsin."
5290,Bernadette,"oh, me neither, not until just now."
4635,Bernadette,he’s bringing cinnamon?
5255,Bernadette,i don’t know.
4676,Bernadette,"if you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh."
5143,Bernadette,you helped him?
3480,Bernadette,i don’t understand.
4549,Bernadette,maybe the spot’s the clue.
4611,Bernadette,i guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.
5766,Bernadette,wait.
5880,Bernadette,it’s like i was excited for a present and got socks.
4495,Bernadette,"this is fun, we never really get to talk shop with penny around. we usually just end up talking about boys."
4142,Bernadette,no.
4070,Bernadette,"no, i’ll…"
5797,Bernadette,"hey, where you been?"
4924,Bernadette,"when you go to emily’s office to practice, you’ll see. it’s fine."
5794,Bernadette,"howie, we have time to do all that stuff."
6106,Bernadette,we didn’t want you to worry.
4588,Bernadette,"me, too."
3938,Bernadette,"i specialize in microorganisms, and amy studies brains."
4829,Bernadette,howie.
5130,Bernadette,not now!
3887,Bernadette,howard?
5935,Bernadette,yeah. i may have just left my infant daughter with patrick and spongebob.
4780,Bernadette,but no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what i was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.
4967,Bernadette,i told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them.
5798,Bernadette,you bought a crib without me?
3582,Bernadette,"okay. you know, busy, school, work. you?"
4955,Bernadette,guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.
3855,Bernadette,"i’m okay, mrs. wolowitz."
5897,Bernadette,i didn’t know what else to do. it worked.
4393,Bernadette,joke?
5975,Bernadette,it’s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of halley you’ve done.
5892,Bernadette,now you hate me too.
5585,Bernadette,"oh. well, thank you for being honest."
3669,Bernadette,"then we went out for a year. come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap."
5151,Bernadette,"all right, we’ll wait."
6100,Bernadette,no.
3587,Bernadette,"no, it’s fine."
3755,Bernadette,"oh, god. what’s happening?"
5553,Bernadette,what is that?
4465,Bernadette,"you know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of raj’s accent."
4304,Bernadette,i just put it in. it’s gonna be a while.
4378,Bernadette,and i told you to bite me.
3673,Bernadette,what?
4160,Bernadette,"good night, rocket man."
4454,Bernadette,"well, there’s no reason you can’t."
4264,Bernadette,what’s your excuse this time?
5362,Bernadette,"all right. let’s start over. i’m redecorating. the furniture, the carpeting, the walls. i’m changing everything that depresses me when i look at it. try not to be one of those things."
4045,Bernadette,"good night, transvestite penny."
4331,Bernadette,think harder.
3525,Bernadette,"ooh, i love your shoes."
3693,Bernadette,what do you say?
4041,Bernadette,nuh-uh. what if she gets me one? i already have a picture of me and howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in venice beach. i’ve suffered enough.
5430,Bernadette,"what happens if i say, come in?"
5032,Bernadette,"well, of course. i would be devastated if my parents split up."
5200,Bernadette,"except, raj is gonna win. isn’t that right, raj?"
4951,Bernadette,housekeeping.
4916,Bernadette,but he’s going to.
6043,Bernadette,"stop, you’re gonna make me cry."
5316,Bernadette,aw. i’m honoured.
4134,Bernadette,"howard, don’t talk like that on your wedding day."
5370,Bernadette,great. i’m gonna go pick out paint samples.
5849,Bernadette,"do something, batman."
3834,Bernadette,"well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but i volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. i mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. oh, i almost forgot. i got you a little present."
4390,Bernadette,we could go to red lobster and talk about it. we’re all thinking it. i just had the decency to wait for him to leave.
3501,Bernadette,can i ask you a question?
5260,Bernadette,"i know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick."
5513,Bernadette,"pretty positive. that’s a joke, because the pregnancy test says…"
4618,Bernadette,i do crap for you all the time. get out there.
5989,Bernadette,"you know she’s at my parents’ house, right?"
5919,Bernadette,i finally got halley to sleep.
5787,Bernadette,you said you got it back.
4791,Bernadette,no.
3761,Bernadette,yeah. last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
3817,Bernadette,so it’s probably genetic.
5962,Bernadette,"you said tickets don’t go on sale till friday, right?"
4917,Bernadette,"long story short, they have seven hbos."
4692,Bernadette,wow.
5736,Bernadette,not every girl dreams about being a mom. sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant. and it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.
3930,Bernadette,which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.
4577,Bernadette,i’m not apologizing to howard. he can come beg me on his knees.
5275,Bernadette,"aw, that was beautiful."
5862,Bernadette,do you really need to record this?
3947,Bernadette,what are you going to do? doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend?
5803,Bernadette,"they thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?"
3988,Bernadette,"i guess you talked to your mom, huh?"
4876,Bernadette,did you get a chance to look over the materials i gave you?
3537,Bernadette,he doesn’t mean salt mines. he means where he works.
5372,Bernadette,seriously? you brought raj over to take your side?
5708,Bernadette,"i’m sorry. my boss wants to meet with me, and i’m stressing."
4243,Bernadette,there’s a book under here.
5578,Bernadette,not with lightning mcqueen here.
4349,Bernadette,"so, what’d you guys think?"
4004,Bernadette,relax. you know leonard’s always been crazy about you. it’s gonna be great.
3666,Bernadette,bye.
4024,Bernadette,"my dad. because i make a lot more money than howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup."
3748,Bernadette,"well, if it makes you feel any better, i’m never speaking to priya again."
4123,Bernadette,"oh, howie. a little star, it’s beautiful. put it on me."
4719,Bernadette,"i love you, too."
4544,Bernadette,let’s go.
5567,Bernadette,i’m not worried about you. i’m worried about me. i don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.
3847,Bernadette,is she moving out?
4531,Bernadette,"go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! how am i faster than you? i’m in heels and i stopped to take a phone call."
5448,Bernadette,oh. okay. sorry to see you go?
4518,Bernadette,"howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. that’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass. "
3891,Bernadette,okay. i just forgot to brush my teeth. i’ll be right back. 
5807,Bernadette,do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? they’re just gonna give you ice and advil like last time.
4700,Bernadette,those tickets were pretty expensive. i had to give howie an advance on his allowance. now he’s never gonna put his toys away.
5552,Bernadette,although i am getting a little machine oil. i think it’s metal.
5168,Bernadette,what happened?
6057,Bernadette,really? i have no trouble believing that at all.
5451,Bernadette,nobody thought that.
5658,Bernadette,do i think he’d be interested? sometimes i hear him pretending to be interviewed when he’s alone in the bathroom.
3610,Bernadette,"oh, no. that movie has melting faces. it reminds me too much of the time i dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the rhesus monkey lab. besides, penny and i are having a girls’ night tonight."
4664,Bernadette,"hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?"
5735,Bernadette,"they did, but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage i made out of a shoebox."
4205,Bernadette,"i am now that you’re back. come on, let’s go home so i can tear off those little pants."
3547,Bernadette,"you know, that one i got. howard, did you say something to leonard about me?"
5034,Bernadette,"sorry, raj. do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?"
3642,Bernadette,"well, live and learn. so, raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?"
5145,Bernadette,"oh, my god, howie."
5462,Bernadette,"yeah. you know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age."
4745,Bernadette,look at amy down there. should we go?
4545,Bernadette,they’re here first. this is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.
3762,Bernadette,"ooh, the priya bashing’s starting early. yay! okay, what’s up with those pantsuits?"
4168,Bernadette,do you tell him that?
5540,Bernadette,"it’s okay to be nervous. i am, too."
5632,Bernadette,yeah.
4599,Bernadette,"no, but we knew that."
5084,Bernadette,i think a victorian christmas sounds nice.
3751,Bernadette,"oh, hey, raj, what are you doing here?"
4674,Bernadette,hey.
5867,Bernadette,i’m so thirsty. give me more ice chips.
4798,Bernadette,hi.
4805,Bernadette,"howie, we moved on a long time ago."
5717,Bernadette,"for what it’s worth, you’re a great liar."
3488,Bernadette,a puppy once bit my face.
4928,Bernadette,"yeah. but instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling penny. it’s cute."
5221,Bernadette,i think i’ll have a beer.
4434,Bernadette,wait. there’s something i have to tell you.
4949,Bernadette,you’re embarrassing me.
5476,Bernadette,"ooh, work that thing."
5780,Bernadette,who is it?
5589,Bernadette,"uh, raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store."
3996,Bernadette,"this is so exciting. if leonard and penny get back together, howard and i can go on double dates with them."
4112,Bernadette,what happened? i thought they cancelled your mission.
4898,Bernadette,"okay. well, if you want, i could help you practice. i played a lot of softball growing up."
4533,Bernadette,"i knew it, we’re gonna lose."
4258,Bernadette,because we don’t live here.
5418,Bernadette,"so, you’re really going out with dave again?"
3752,Bernadette,"uh-huh. so, uh, howard’s not here?"
4948,Bernadette,amy.
4376,Bernadette,"i’ve been working late every night. all i asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. but did he do it? no. he just kept on playing that stupid game. you like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine."
5419,Bernadette,but he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves sheldon.
5870,Bernadette,let’s keep thinking.
5351,Bernadette,"we put amy on a dating app, and we’re seeing what’s out there."
4145,Bernadette,"they all got ordained, they’re all marrying us, it’s adorable, if you want to hear come closer."
4960,Bernadette,see? isn’t this better than a hotel room?
4300,Bernadette,"okay, let’s go."
5833,Bernadette,i thought it was brave. does that count as liking it?
4627,Bernadette,it’s okay.
4011,Bernadette,"oh, that’s nice."
5666,Bernadette,"you do realize those weren’t documentaries, right?"
5538,Bernadette,how is that a drunk text?
4131,Bernadette,"so, what do you say, amy?"
4194,Bernadette,"how you doing, howie? you feeling a little better?"
6058,Bernadette,"we’re talking about the same leonard, right?"
4031,Bernadette,"really? oh, that’d be so great."
5814,Bernadette,hey.
5826,Bernadette,why would you buy it?
4775,Bernadette,"well, i hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends."
4989,Bernadette,why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?
4474,Bernadette,sorry’s not good enough. maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done.
4183,Bernadette,"nope, this is my proud face."
4435,Bernadette,i know what was in your dad’s letter.
3687,Bernadette,are you guys doing okay?
5506,Bernadette,"oh, cut off his head? that’s where his little nose is."
4270,Bernadette,that’s a lot for a kid to deal with.
5852,Bernadette,"hey, could you please go to the market for me?"
4430,Bernadette,"yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. and he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. i don’t know why he was upset. they were bigger on him than me."
5155,Bernadette,"okay, thank you so much."
6078,Bernadette,you doing okay?
5784,Bernadette,is someone else here?
3727,Bernadette,no.
4884,Bernadette,"it’s driving me crazy. just this afternoon, i saw on instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure."
3564,Bernadette,really uncomfortable.
5838,Bernadette,"stuart, we’d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we’re about to have a baby."
4403,Bernadette,that’s true. every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.
6091,Bernadette,it’s too late for me. save yourself.
3721,Bernadette,"well, i don’t really have much of anything in the house."
5053,Bernadette,"oh, how is she?"
4746,Bernadette,"come on, raj, it’s not the same without you."
4244,Bernadette,i got it.
5393,Bernadette,"kinda. before i met howie, i liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends."
4154,Bernadette,how clear is the image of me on that screen?
3521,Bernadette,i don’t think i can. i don’t have howard’s street cred.
4993,Bernadette,"i guess. it’s really not that important. hey, up here."
4157,Bernadette,"aw, that’s such good news, howie. thank you for telling her."
6098,Bernadette,bring it in.
5725,Bernadette,not really.
5491,Bernadette,"ew, really? get it out."
5141,Bernadette,this is why i had to rewrite our wedding vows.
4008,Bernadette,i’m a very vengeful person.
5343,Bernadette,"i thought so, too."
4822,Bernadette,how did that get you into science?
4966,Bernadette,maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.
5597,Bernadette,yeah.
4741,Bernadette,don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.
4475,Bernadette,"burbank airport, please."
5150,Bernadette,"sure you don’t want to go home? when the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us."
5889,Bernadette,not funny.
3912,Bernadette,just do it!
5354,Bernadette,"yeah, why wouldn’t you tell us?"
4348,Bernadette,"i don’t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!"
5510,Bernadette,i don’t know. maybe it says something on the back.
3969,Bernadette,did it work?
5485,Bernadette,made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.
6112,Bernadette,"i threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?"
6117,Bernadette,like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!
6125,Bernadette,hi. it’s stuart. we met at the comic book store. i was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime. it’s okay if you say no. it might be the kick in the pants i need to start taking zoloft.
4843,Bernadette,i’m glad i got that mocha. and you know what else i’m glad about? i bought you a brownie and i ate it in the car.
4895,Bernadette,i can’t believe you’re sore.
4199,Bernadette,waiting for my husband.
3606,Bernadette,isn’t she a pip?
6025,Bernadette,"howard, i’m sorry if i’m being weird, but it has nothing to do with you."
4835,Bernadette,"you know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. this is exactly what it’s gonna be like."
4763,Bernadette,"what is that, like, the indian sherlock holmes?"
5277,Bernadette,amy.
5383,Bernadette,"yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy."
5062,Bernadette,"i did say that, didn’t i?"
4624,Bernadette,what do you mean?
3856,Bernadette,"oh, god."
5172,Bernadette,what should we do?
5654,Bernadette,"so, beverly, did you know penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?"
4939,Bernadette,"hell, yeah."
3508,Bernadette,maybe you need to think about it a little.
4065,Bernadette,"ooh, look at this pretty purple robe i just got. you should put on yours and then we’ll match."
4504,Bernadette,come on. i apologize. can we please just let it go?
5457,Bernadette,"boy, when was the last time stuart cleaned this place?"
3803,Bernadette,not engaged. very interesting. i have to tinkle.
6062,Bernadette,terrified.
5691,Bernadette,"‘cause i’m up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out i’m pregnant they might give it to someone else."
3570,Bernadette,"okay, sheldon. what happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough rem sleep?"
5604,Bernadette,"and, of course, howie and i both want you to be a part of all this."
3932,Bernadette,so is that a yes?
4487,Bernadette,"hey, you don’t think i’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?"
5426,Bernadette,fan of what?
5911,Bernadette,"so, normal."
4578,Bernadette,great news. a raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.
3878,Bernadette,what did you think was going to happen?
5416,Bernadette,i’ll do it.
5369,Bernadette,fine. then the dining room.
5216,Bernadette,"howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?"
3550,Bernadette,are you saying i need to ask your permission to hang out with leonard?
3690,Bernadette,yeah. you’re a hottie.
3980,Bernadette,not him.
5519,Bernadette,i’m pregnant.
4755,Bernadette,hi.
5056,Bernadette,"just builds character. like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and democrats.”"
3992,Bernadette,"yay, so we’re good."
4279,Bernadette,howard was so angry i had to mash up benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.
4151,Bernadette,good for you. i just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.
4751,Bernadette,that was ten years ago.
5507,Bernadette,"howie, this is just your hypochondria."
5956,Bernadette,making lasagna.
4645,Bernadette,"raj, this dinner was amazing. if you’re here much longer, i’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes."
4923,Bernadette,really?
4610,Bernadette,you can have a quiet day and watch the game here.
5665,Bernadette,"come on, howard, you’re overreacting."
6150,Bernadette,the only thing i hate more than you right now is that book.
3641,Bernadette,"howard, help me out of the tub! i’m stuck again!"
5174,Bernadette,howie.
4006,Bernadette,i’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and penny.
4236,Bernadette,i’m always on your side.
3514,Bernadette,then you’re insane.
3765,Bernadette,not if they’re doing it for a long time.
6039,Bernadette,it would be nice to raise halley to be a little more independent than you were.
4913,Bernadette,"howie, i am so proud of you."
3871,Bernadette,"howie, that’s wonderful! congratulations!"
3735,Bernadette,"we just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing."
4088,Bernadette,i’ve actually been thinking i’m going to hyphenate: bernadette mary-ann rostenkowski-wolowitz.
5606,Bernadette,yeah.
4722,Bernadette,let’s go.
5434,Bernadette,how about something a little more realistic?
4322,Bernadette,"hey, let’s help raj meet a girl tonight."
3478,Bernadette,to the toilet! is that okay with you?
4275,Bernadette,no husband of mine is gonna break his mother’s heart!
6136,Bernadette,"cinnamon. where are you, my little lamb chop?"
3801,Bernadette,are you concerned your parents might not approve of leonard?
5621,Bernadette,that wasn’t nice.
4367,Bernadette,i make plenty of money. you make peanuts.
5159,Bernadette,what’s happening?
5131,Bernadette,your mom having fun in florida?
5222,Bernadette,why?
4190,Bernadette,what’s wrong?
3831,Bernadette,the thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. i’m getting my phd.
3802,Bernadette,"well, i wouldn’t worry about it. it’s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
6155,Bernadette,"howie, can you get that?"
5539,Bernadette,sure.
4455,Bernadette,absolutely. all we need to do is spend a little time and find something you’re passionate about.
3638,Bernadette,"oh, right. did you get your hair cut?"
4423,Bernadette,"told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner. i know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth it."
3542,Bernadette,"oh. you got me again. this isn’t non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. excuse me."
4786,Bernadette,i’m so sorry.
5983,Bernadette,"oh, we’re smarter than that."
4992,Bernadette,i don’t know. they just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it.
5211,Bernadette,"okay, okay. when he’s at comic-con, i’m bringing in a wrecking ball."
5627,Bernadette,i guess we could give it a try.
5044,Bernadette,who were you in couples therapy with?
5068,Bernadette,just want you to know i didn’t mean to be rude about your grandson.
3651,Bernadette,yes.
6018,Bernadette,"no, i’m fine."
4074,Bernadette,hello.
3549,Bernadette,"you’re not jealous of leonard, are you?"
3655,Bernadette,i hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.
5963,Bernadette,"you said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?"
6029,Bernadette,i guess.
3510,Bernadette,"hello, howard."
6003,Bernadette,okay.
4398,Bernadette,"i don’t know about you guys, but i’m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover."
5603,Bernadette,you saw him carrying that.
5194,Bernadette,"yes, penny plays for me."
5929,Bernadette,call me. don’t call howard.
4932,Bernadette,fine. what is it?
5517,Bernadette,"calm down, it’s gonna be okay."
4438,Bernadette,i’m sorry. i should have left it alone.
4029,Bernadette,"so, what are we gonna do?"
5575,Bernadette,i’m kind of getting into the groove here.
5404,Bernadette,he and his tiny bladder can take the bus. 
3946,Bernadette,"i’m too small for twister. and roller coasters. and sitting with my feet on the floor. hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, mom."
6073,Bernadette,"yeah, you guys did this all on your own."
3860,Bernadette,"good morning, handsome."
3511,Bernadette,"i can’t now, i’m working."
4422,Bernadette,"howie, you okay?"
4417,Bernadette,"sheldon, i’ve been cooking all day."
5617,Bernadette,good. a little tired.
3702,Bernadette,me too.
5329,Bernadette,was it?
5643,Bernadette,this is getting fun. what’s next?
3726,Bernadette,okay.
4317,Bernadette,"i don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do."
4119,Bernadette,"but, howie, my dad can be a bully. he’s gonna make you cancel your space flight."
3556,Bernadette,"come here, tushy face."
3540,Bernadette,"really? oh, that’d be great. how exciting is that?"
4994,Bernadette,what? how?
5922,Bernadette,"well, i didn’t. i also skipped a birthing class to see zootopia so back off."
4071,Bernadette,are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?
5103,Bernadette,we were talking about penny’s job.
4494,Bernadette,to the advancement of science.
4784,Bernadette,am i a terrible person?
5111,Bernadette,"well, now we have two reasons."
5144,Bernadette,what?
5186,Bernadette,"so, i put stickers on everything we’re gonna sell. we just need help taking it all out to the driveway."
5690,Bernadette,"i bet it was barbara chen in retrovirus. she might have heard me throwing up one morning. every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she’s so great."
4770,Bernadette,so i guess you two are making it work long distance.
6128,Bernadette,"all right, just hurry!"
5605,Bernadette,"raj, raj, wait."
5537,Bernadette,that sounds fun.
4556,Bernadette,"aw, poor howie. we good? i’m gonna take a bath."
4947,Bernadette,we are.
4953,Bernadette,was it working?
4671,Bernadette,or maybe just stop talking.
5243,Bernadette,ready to call tech support?
3975,Bernadette,after you’ve been thoroughly amazed.
4484,Bernadette,"ooh! come on, back me up here."
5659,Bernadette,"um, you should probably talk to penny, too."
5387,Bernadette,"oh, nice."
4771,Bernadette,"speak for yourself. last month, my company both invented and cured restless eye syndrome. ka-ching, ya blinky chumps."
3558,Bernadette,"oh, yeah, i’m starved. when you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite."
6013,Bernadette,meatloaf.
5557,Bernadette,"well, if you change your mind, we’ll be here."
5661,Bernadette,howie? you doing okay? you’ve been in there a while.
5493,Bernadette,i don’t know how to turn off the jets.
5083,Bernadette,you’re right. now where did we land on my bathroom?
3911,Bernadette,hurry! we’re running out of time!
5767,Bernadette,next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
3780,Bernadette,i don’t want anything in my ample bosom.
5720,Bernadette,do you know what? it’s just a research project. the most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. it’s all i need to give my life meaning.
4637,Bernadette,"aw, that’s so sweet."
3704,Bernadette,"please, i think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself."
5125,Bernadette,"oh, amelia."
5595,Bernadette,"oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat."
5326,Bernadette,"i’m sorry. i just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life."
4656,Bernadette,hi.
5278,Bernadette,"i know it hurts now, but it’s gonna get better."
5074,Bernadette,what else don’t i know about?
3959,Bernadette,"penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. you’re a good person now."
4170,Bernadette,i had no idea you were unhappy.
4844,Bernadette,"last night was a little rough, but i think we’re gonna get through this."
4082,Bernadette,"if you don’t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. i have one, they’re great."
3659,Bernadette,"hang on. it’s leonard. hi, leonard."
3906,Bernadette,"hi, sheldon."
4598,Bernadette,you because you just called him your indian friend.
4508,Bernadette,"so, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?"
6120,Bernadette,my universe!
5667,Bernadette,"guys, come on. we’re meeting everyone for dinner."
4815,Bernadette,"me, too. although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a death star cake."
3951,Bernadette,i love this dress. how come i never see you wear it?
4789,Bernadette,"what do you mean, yes?"
3897,Bernadette,what?
5280,Bernadette,what happened? they just got married.
5886,Bernadette,"yeah, he has a gift."
5410,Bernadette,hi. we’d like to volunteer.
3686,Bernadette,"um, penny, that’s glenn. glenn, that’s penny."
4529,Bernadette,i’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. the slowest bullet in the world.
4491,Bernadette,"the hotel’s nice. there’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun. "
3990,Bernadette,"well, seeing as how i make way more money than you anyway, what if i work and you stay home with the kids?"
3828,Bernadette,"no, because i’m engaged to a putz. you let me believe i was the reason she had a heart attack."
5055,Bernadette,"oh, yeah. i remember him from the picnic. he was the one crying like a wuss the whole time."
3734,Bernadette,we’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out.
3993,Bernadette,"you know, i don’t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?"
6060,Bernadette,i wouldn’t trust her. he’s thin and sexy like a jewish greyhound.
3789,Bernadette,he’s a consultant.
4952,Bernadette,it was us the whole time.
5191,Bernadette,it’s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.
4659,Bernadette,well…
5769,Bernadette,"keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun."
6121,Bernadette,i think they’re on to me. the story’s starting to fall apart.
4480,Bernadette,"long story short, she’s on the no fly list and we might have been followed here by a drone."
4625,Bernadette,"sorry. i really want to hear how sad you are. i’ll be back in like five, ten minutes."
5330,Bernadette,that really happened?
6140,Bernadette,"yeah, honey, i’m still stuck at work. really? penny said that? okay, it’s true. i’m sorry. i’ll see you at home. yeah, yeah, i’ll put it on."
5901,Bernadette,"don’t make me cry, either."
5756,Bernadette,"hmm. the doctor’s gone for the day, so it doesn’t matter."
5391,Bernadette,"across the street, in the left window."
5409,Bernadette,"we are, and i believe the word you’re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh."
4851,Bernadette,but we have jobs. we can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.
6014,Bernadette,stuart made it.
4820,Bernadette,"yeah, i thought it was working for a while, but then i found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. how about you?"
5134,Bernadette,"i know you don’t like stuart being in the house, but the store’s about to reopen, i’m sure he’ll get back on his feet."
5359,Bernadette,"pause the game, howard."
6094,Bernadette,a little clingy.
5530,Bernadette,"no, i’m embarrassed."
6131,Bernadette,i don’t sound like that.
5733,Bernadette,my dad built it for me.
3481,Bernadette,"i know, i’m studying it."
3627,Bernadette,she’s been in there a long time.
3786,Bernadette,"leonard lives here. priya’s from india. people meet, howard. god!"
6015,Bernadette,sounds great.
5114,Bernadette,"ho-ho, it really didn’t."
4646,Bernadette,"aw. howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?"
4596,Bernadette,i think that reason’s called racism.
5791,Bernadette,what are you doing?
5602,Bernadette,no.
3983,Bernadette,"ugh, it was horrible. with their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. i don’t want to get dressed. joey keeps spitting in my mouth. this isn’t the way mom makes waffles. well, okay, put your hand in here. let’s see how you like this waffle!"
4824,Bernadette,"and even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun."
4842,Bernadette,queen? i’ve been killing myself here.
5014,Bernadette,"because he’s our friend, and you two need to get along. and why can’t he take your mom? you took her to your prom."
5913,Bernadette,"it’s supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time."
4355,Bernadette,"hold on, who decides who’s worthy? does the hammer decide?"
5220,Bernadette,oh. how do you drink it?
5010,Bernadette,"ooh, i have an idea. maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over."
3516,Bernadette,wow. 
4896,Bernadette,but they throw an actual ball. you were throwing air at a tv.
4854,Bernadette,"sorry i’m late. the leaf blower broke, so i had to hand-dry my mother-in-law."
4999,Bernadette,"and i think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. oh, amy, i’m so sorry. that was over the line."
5921,Bernadette,"for howie’s occupation, should i include that he was an astronaut?"
3989,Bernadette,"look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and i think i came up with a solution."
4827,Bernadette,we set it up in howie’s old room.
4726,Bernadette,fine. can i at least shower first?
4640,Bernadette,thank you.
4505,Bernadette,thanks.
5977,Bernadette,keep it. consider it a gift.
5671,Bernadette,"it’s probably just a coincidence. speed up a little, see if he stays with you."
4591,Bernadette,maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.
4425,Bernadette,you must be curious.
3670,Bernadette,do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?
5188,Bernadette,i think you just answered your own question.
5612,Bernadette,of course.
5861,Bernadette,we showed up too early. we’ll keep you posted.
4688,Bernadette,"you know, i do work at a pharmaceutical company. if you can make this happen today, i can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants. "
5973,Bernadette,kinda. 
5778,Bernadette,"let me know when you start, because that wasn’t funny."
5694,Bernadette,"from all the dove bars i ate. i’m pregnant. try to keep up. i’m sorry, i have to go find out if my boss knows."
5982,Bernadette,we’re smart. i’m sure we can think of something.
5480,Bernadette,"not you. i own your ass. the real question is, where are you with emily?"
4887,Bernadette,"hey, amy."
5549,Bernadette,"yeah. the other day i sniffed out where howie hid the girl scout cookies. no more tagalongs, my ass."
5749,Bernadette,"something’s wrong. i don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. honestly, i’m not even sure i like babies."
3783,Bernadette,"yeah. but leonard’s impressive, too."
4874,Bernadette,"okay, calm down. you’re not his father, he’s not your father. nobody’s anybody’s father."
4485,Bernadette,"okay, i cast a love spell on sheldon and amy."
3637,Bernadette,"it won’t help. once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it."
5974,Bernadette,howie?
6149,Bernadette,"i changed my mind, hang up, hang up."
5950,Bernadette,"oh, my god, you really are spoiled."
3940,Bernadette,"oh, he’s a sweetie."
5363,Bernadette,is it about how i can’t have new wallpaper ’cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?
4661,Bernadette,the one in the turtleneck is cute.
5701,Bernadette,"no. i confronted barbara chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what i was talking about."
4987,Bernadette,what would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
4370,Bernadette,those chinese acrobats in cirque du soleil made it look so easy.
3600,Bernadette,mm! what are you doing?
3904,Bernadette,"i just did what i did because i love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than i can handle."
6021,Bernadette,"okay, you won. can i finish what i’m doing?"
5122,Bernadette,why? why did it feel different?
3796,Bernadette,you texted me penny’s dating an astronaut.
5936,Bernadette,"yeah, we’re all dressed up. why go home?"
3745,Bernadette,"i feel like i’m supposed to say that bitch, but i don’t have enough information."
3592,Bernadette,i know. i work here.
4397,Bernadette,"penny, what did you say?"
5338,Bernadette,yeah.
4581,Bernadette,"well, let’s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips. "
4295,Bernadette,here.
4387,Bernadette,it smells pretty ripe in here. you kind feel it in your eyes.
5968,Bernadette,thank you.
4668,Bernadette,you actually got him to do it.
4293,Bernadette,are you okay?!
4832,Bernadette,"look, i’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?"
3791,Bernadette,in the bathroom.
3548,Bernadette,he says if i go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.
4227,Bernadette,what are you talking about? it’ll be fun. all your friends’ll be there.
4930,Bernadette,nope.
3593,Bernadette,"howard, you did have a real woman. i was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll’s brains out."
5706,Bernadette,"oh, thanks. you know, i just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes."
5002,Bernadette,what?
4593,Bernadette,"penny, can we please get our drinks?"
5577,Bernadette,since when do you work on weekends?
4230,Bernadette,"yeah, well, now you’re a smurf. keep walking."
5522,Bernadette,"easy for you to say, skinny bitch. sorry, hormones."
4212,Bernadette,like my husband?
4872,Bernadette,"well, the only reason she got it is ’cause the guy who interviewed her loves me."
4436,Bernadette,i made him tell us.
4922,Bernadette,i’m sure you’re worried about nothing.
3960,Bernadette,you’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.
3775,Bernadette,you think?
4288,Bernadette,"oh, no. where was it parked?"
4573,Bernadette,i may have overreacted.
4247,Bernadette,why would you be embarrassed to tell us?
3807,Bernadette,you mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
5033,Bernadette,"well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off."
4623,Bernadette,so why don’t you do that with them?
3964,Bernadette,donated.
4797,Bernadette,how?
3810,Bernadette,you guys ready to order?
5747,Bernadette,"once, i was supposed to babysit my brothers. our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets."
5762,Bernadette,everyone said i could do better.
5979,Bernadette,you just don’t want to go alone with sheldon.
5593,Bernadette,raj found all these childbirth videos online. this one is of a woman giving birth in a river.
4282,Bernadette,"you’re right. and i’m sure sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science."
6005,Bernadette,trying to catch up on office e-mails before i go back.
5066,Bernadette,thank you.
3811,Bernadette,i don’t understand.
5695,Bernadette,thanks. you guys are the best.
4224,Bernadette,i love you.
5302,Bernadette,this party’s weird.
4520,Bernadette,it’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.
4579,Bernadette,"in the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections, mo’ money."
6107,Bernadette,"yeah, but you’re gonna be back in three months."
6124,Bernadette,who is it?
4052,Bernadette,"howie, what happened to you?"
5808,Bernadette,"fine, we’ll go to the e.r. just stop selling me on the van."
4187,Bernadette,what do you want me to do?
4550,Bernadette,"stop her, leonard, stop her."
4666,Bernadette,how is this any different?
3530,Bernadette,"so, leonard, howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics."
5732,Bernadette,sorry. i should probably keep this in case we have a girl.
3768,Bernadette,"well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?"
5912,Bernadette,"you know, i just read that a team at mit. developed a device that helps people read human emotions."
4602,Bernadette,then you made her cry and leave.
5556,Bernadette,or she’s telling the truth and just being nice.
4022,Bernadette,you mean my special day?
3474,Bernadette,strike two.
5148,Bernadette,"um, well, it’s, uh, black. there’s a red ribbon tied to the handle."
6086,Bernadette,"you’re excited about this opportunity, right?"
5097,Bernadette,you feeling okay? you hardly touched your goose.
3685,Bernadette,"oh, come on, howard, be realistic."
5969,Bernadette,there she goes.
4396,Bernadette,what did you tell your boss?
5988,Bernadette,don’t do that. we’ll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.
5298,Bernadette,your sweater?
4678,Bernadette,i don’t think you would.
6093,Bernadette,"just listen. i don’t know if you realize this, but whenever you’re between projects, you tend to get a little insecure."
4553,Bernadette,you were really quiet during dinner. is everything okay?
5879,Bernadette,i couldn’t explain it if i tried.
3613,Bernadette,you are?
5906,Bernadette,"i’ve been seeing him for years, i’m still not convinced he’s real."
4371,Bernadette,"if you could bend that far, you’d be doing us both a favour.  "
3853,Bernadette,and your mom would be okay with that?
4658,Bernadette,but then he gets to see what the world would be like if he’d never been born.
4838,Bernadette,"howie, i’m back!"
4864,Bernadette,"don’t be. you are built for pharmaceutical sales. you’re cute, you’re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things."
4950,Bernadette,what?
5590,Bernadette,yes and yes.
5004,Bernadette,right here.
4740,Bernadette,"i think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you."
5309,Bernadette,bet she’d still tell her if she got married.
5301,Bernadette,we’ll take you to the mall to get it done.
4099,Bernadette,why didn’t you tell me
6104,Bernadette,"nowitzki. i googled her, she’s pretty cute."
6154,Bernadette,hello?
5687,Bernadette,i don’t believe this.
4115,Bernadette,wait. i don’t want to be the one who stands in your way.
5115,Bernadette,"no, give me the remote."
5818,Bernadette,"look at that, put them in a tiny flash t-shirt and it’s you."
4752,Bernadette,what are you doing?
4867,Bernadette,you’ll be fine. just be yourself.
3615,Bernadette,or we could just stay here.
3740,Bernadette,i would take that deal all day long.
3924,Bernadette,"yes, absolutely fine."
6146,Bernadette,"i don’t know what you think you’re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. we’re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? whatever it is you’re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to howard or there’s no dessert for either of you. look at me when i’m talking to you. and don’t think…"
5910,Bernadette,you actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark. 
4985,Bernadette,oh.
4863,Bernadette,yep.
5392,Bernadette,right here.
5853,Bernadette,"howie, they’ve been doing everything for you."
4813,Bernadette,"oh, we know you don’t lie to her."
5324,Bernadette,i can’t believe sheldon asked you to be his roommate.
6135,Bernadette,howard?
5927,Bernadette,"we will. got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. let’s party."
4628,Bernadette,thanks again for cooking.
5992,Bernadette,"well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to target for diapers, things are about to get nuts."
5634,Bernadette,yeah.
4572,Bernadette,hi.
3898,Bernadette,"i do, with all my heart."
3859,Bernadette,"no, it’s not. i’m not going in there."
5117,Bernadette,‘cause it’s embarrassing.
4413,Bernadette,"he’s our guest, we can’t just ask him to straighten our closet."
4235,Bernadette,me? what did i do?
5719,Bernadette,"hey, i learned a long time ago, when you’re four feet eleven and eye level with every guy’s crotch, that’s where you punch."
4357,Bernadette,"well, what if the hulk picked up thor while thor is holding the hammer?"
5295,Bernadette,"speaking of sheldon, how’s single life treating you?"
5371,Bernadette,"hey, raj. dad and i were just talking about taking down this wall."
3997,Bernadette,"mm, uh… how’s it going in there, penny?"
4345,Bernadette,why are they staring?
4429,Bernadette,feel better?
5571,Bernadette,"25% of profits due to sheldon cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of howard and bernadette wolowitz. sheldon, that’s so nice."
3839,Bernadette,i’m nice to everyone.
4946,Bernadette,i’m proud of her. this is a great opportunity. it’s nice to see her take it seriously.
3844,Bernadette,"what are you going to get at the train store, sheldon?"
5773,Bernadette,can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? was that the front door?
6074,Bernadette,so what happens next?
4612,Bernadette,"if you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy."
6138,Bernadette,your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron.
5746,Bernadette,"i keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. what if it never happens?"
5449,Bernadette,you’re very welcome.
6103,Bernadette,ugh. how can you think that? why would you even put those words together?
4356,Bernadette,leonard and sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. why don’t we go look at those?
4369,Bernadette,"oh, thanks."
4795,Bernadette,i’m excited to meet emily.
3684,Bernadette,i think mr. wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. but he should know that i am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.
5461,Bernadette,"i don’t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. the teddy bear stuart won the night we took him to the fair."
5257,Bernadette,did you eat all my yoghurt?
3922,Bernadette,"oh, howie."
6077,Bernadette,you’re kidding. why would they do that?
6020,Bernadette,"love you, too."
4263,Bernadette,"so, is there anything i can do to help you with the move tomorrow?"
4176,Bernadette,"oh, howie."
6026,Bernadette,"no. i didn’t want to tell you, but i’m having a really tough time about going back to work."
5566,Bernadette,"howie, you’re about to form a legal partnership with sheldon cooper."
5052,Bernadette,"i love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought."
6033,Bernadette,what if she likes the people who work there more than us?
5644,Bernadette,"oh, i haven’t had a drink in months."
4441,Bernadette,think you could take a break?
5202,Bernadette,hey.
5025,Bernadette,not anymore.
5698,Bernadette,oh. how was it?
4120,Bernadette,"oh, god, i’m so nervous. i don’t think i can watch."
3715,Bernadette,wrong answer.
5027,Bernadette,he said that to her?
5903,Bernadette,"i could take a bath in the sink. i don’t, but i can."
5924,Bernadette,"sure. open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there’s a mountain of dirty laundry. wash it or burn in, your choice. ugh, be right back."
4929,Bernadette,"well, maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas."
3699,Bernadette,nothing. just thinking about the noises people make during sex.
5270,Bernadette,our pleasure. you feeling okay?
5336,Bernadette,"you mean, not a scientist?"
5414,Bernadette,i can’t.
6142,Bernadette,why are you being a baby?
4084,Bernadette,"no, you have to stop now."
3729,Bernadette,i have to take you?
5942,Bernadette,"and leonard loves you so much, he married you twice. "
3957,Bernadette,kind of sounds like you were. and maybe a felon.
5181,Bernadette,"yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before."
5196,Bernadette,"hey, raj. if howard can’t keep the tardis, how great would it look at your place?"
4868,Bernadette,"penny, i wouldn’t have put you up for this job if i didn’t think you could handle it."
4710,Bernadette,"well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways."
4307,Bernadette,"hey, dad, maybe you could take howard fishing sometime. give you guys a chance to get to know each other better."
4421,Bernadette,"howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?"
5077,Bernadette,i feel so bad.
3657,Bernadette,really? and miss the keynote?
3603,Bernadette,"oh, i take pacts very seriously. one time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. that day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed ebola with the common cold."
4569,Bernadette,"that’s the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus. "
3970,Bernadette,ooh. i like the fabric. where’d she get it?
3862,Bernadette,your mom and i made you breakfast.
5287,Bernadette,"i don’t know what to think. but then again, i just found out about it."
4957,Bernadette,we want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.
4148,Bernadette,"oh, my god, it’s happening."
4420,Bernadette,"oh, my god, it’s beautiful. look, he found the juggling pins i hid."
5153,Bernadette,there’s no way you could’ve known. be right back. excuse me?
4571,Bernadette,find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
4020,Bernadette,"howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?"
4965,Bernadette,oh. what’s going on?
4937,Bernadette,"oh, baby. that story’s made up, isn’t it?"
4449,Bernadette,i’m gonna make some coffee.
4657,Bernadette,"hey, i brought over it’s a wonderful life if you guys want to watch it later."
4274,Bernadette,"well, you should’ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story."
4335,Bernadette,"well, alex is your employee. if she’s doing something that’s making leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her."
4575,Bernadette,"it’s not? you spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. last week, you two got a couples massage. so, when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings."
4592,Bernadette,"he’s kidding. if that were true, it’d be so much bigger."
4130,Bernadette,that wasn’t going to be our processional music.
4340,Bernadette,"when he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom’s pants out."
5104,Bernadette,"well, they’re not a hundred percent wolf. they’re a werewolf, that’s only part wolf. it’s like comparing apples to oranges."
5914,Bernadette,wouldn’t that be nice.
5615,Bernadette,isn’t that the best?
4289,Bernadette,that doesn’t make sense. sheldon doesn’t have a spot. was it maybe in howard’s spot?
4399,Bernadette,"okay, so, you pick your princess, sleeping beauty, snow white, cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works."
4395,Bernadette,let’s think.
3520,Bernadette,are you kidding? that’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me.
4499,Bernadette,"yes, it’s all cool. although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you."
4216,Bernadette,you could start by taking an interest in his work.
4019,Bernadette,he’s gonna learn to poop in space.
3981,Bernadette,i told you i’m not good with kids.
5395,Bernadette,"he’s cute, right?"
4831,Bernadette,i would do it for my mother.
4971,Bernadette,without asking me?
5748,Bernadette,"what? why? who are you calling? you’re gonna rat me out to howard, aren’t you? you’re such a snitch, no wonder i don’t like you."
4404,Bernadette,come at me. see what happens.
5640,Bernadette,all right.
5623,Bernadette,"it’s okay, you should go."
4159,Bernadette,thanks for fixing it. i love you.
5728,Bernadette,"oh, there’s so much junk in there, it’s embarrassing."
3667,Bernadette,yeah?
5954,Bernadette,that’s a great idea.
4478,Bernadette,"i got a sexy new tube top that says come hither, and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, jack."
5790,Bernadette,what do you do in there?
6092,Bernadette,"come here, let’s talk."
4705,Bernadette,that’s cute.
3979,Bernadette,that’s it. no cake for you. anyone else want to join the no cake club?
3636,Bernadette,"oh, i was working with penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and i was just trying to remember if i washed my hands."
5267,Bernadette,"well, you’ve been living here a while now."
5234,Bernadette,"you’re welcome. hey, now that you’re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner."
4590,Bernadette,"oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it."
4150,Bernadette,i can. how are you?
4811,Bernadette,of course.
6070,Bernadette,tammy jo st. cloud.
4251,Bernadette,"uh, but we got you a b-minus on purpose to make it believable."
4291,Bernadette,because i’m the one who had it towed.
4361,Bernadette,"oh, howie, i love these."
3926,Bernadette,we can go down to the korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.
5650,Bernadette,"thank you for this. you know, ever since people found out i’m having a baby, i feel like i became pregnant bernadette. it was nice to take a little break tonight."
6052,Bernadette,ruin it for me and i’ll break this glass over your head.
4296,Bernadette,"amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?"
3816,Bernadette,"you’re a real hero, howard."
4769,Bernadette,so one of us went back in time to kill stuart?
4997,Bernadette,"no, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity."
5600,Bernadette,"no, not really."
6069,Bernadette,no. and the little lady has a name.
3896,Bernadette,"oh, god, you’re right. i took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. i need to apologize."
3808,Bernadette,do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
4257,Bernadette,50 cents sounds right. let’s go.
3952,Bernadette,"oh, they all went with leonard to confront his childhood bully."
4901,Bernadette,keep going.
6137,Bernadette,"howie, stop. i can’t talk like that. amy’s right here."
5918,Bernadette,"you’re not gonna get information, you’re just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings."
5450,Bernadette,great. i can finally show you where the laundry room is.
4107,Bernadette,"yeah, the wedding’s still on. "
4665,Bernadette,"aw, so i guess if it weren’t for me, you’d still be living with her, huh?"
4897,Bernadette,i’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.
5065,Bernadette,i think i’d rather go.
4552,Bernadette,you suck so hard.
5286,Bernadette,i guess that’s true.
4302,Bernadette,‘cause i did it!
4014,Bernadette,where are you guys going to eat?
5581,Bernadette,son of a bitch.
5670,Bernadette,you’re being ridiculous.
3493,Bernadette,no. that’s the sad part.
5737,Bernadette,sorry i flipped out on you. i think it’s just hormones.
4164,Bernadette,"what about you, penny?"
3688,Bernadette,"well, that shouldn’t be too hard. he’s such a cutie."
5334,Bernadette,what did he say?
4526,Bernadette,"hey, you’ll know when i’m yelling at you."
5899,Bernadette,i think i live here now. it’s fine.
4038,Bernadette,"i don’t know. you can’t take it down. you’ll break her heart. look at that face. that enormous, unsettling, crazy face."
4229,Bernadette,"hey, i just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. i’m gonna be washing paint out of my smurf for a month."
5037,Bernadette,what?
5761,Bernadette,i was disappointed to see the man i was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.
5764,Bernadette,"well, now i don’t know if i want to know!"
4713,Bernadette,excuse me. you are at valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. now get back over there and be with her.
4693,Bernadette,"no, thanks."
5201,Bernadette,"come on, get in her head. be intimidating."
5424,Bernadette,‘cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus.
4042,Bernadette,"mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting."
3813,Bernadette,that’s what you ordered.
4911,Bernadette,i think so.
4721,Bernadette,"oh, that sounds so romantic."
4582,Bernadette,"yeah, it’s just a precaution. if there was a problem, i’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. sorry i messed up our date."
5765,Bernadette,yes.
3846,Bernadette,why would i keep clothes at your mother’s house?
5686,Bernadette,he won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a flintstone.
5132,Bernadette,she’s just being nice.
5685,Bernadette,"i’m worried about howard. ever since that guy from the air force showed up, he’s been a nervous wreck."
5496,Bernadette,"um, i don’t know, look it up on your phone. i’m gonna wrap it in a towel."
6145,Bernadette,"hi. i’m bernadette maryann rostenkowski from yorba linda, california."
5054,Bernadette,"hey, what are you talking about?"
4528,Bernadette,because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? i’m sure she finds it charming.
3942,Bernadette,"oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. and after she lost her marbles with her remote control."
3663,Bernadette,are you here for the conference?
3590,Bernadette,does that mean slutty trolls?
3692,Bernadette,"most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up."
5544,Bernadette,"no, no, no. come on in."
4605,Bernadette,sure.
5951,Bernadette,"when you moved here, you didn’t have a lot of money. how’d you get by?"
5909,Bernadette,i have one. what if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?
5000,Bernadette,"please don’t go. up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong."
4217,Bernadette,he’s an experimental physicist.
5081,Bernadette,i can’t let you do that.
4828,Bernadette,maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.
4580,Bernadette,"oh, calm down. if i had it, i’d be dead already."
5051,Bernadette,"i love that you take pride in your looks, even when i have to pee in the morning, and you’re in there spending an hour on your hair."
5638,Bernadette,dungeons & dragons? that sounds about right.
4536,Bernadette,who cares? focus on the game.
5396,Bernadette,"yeah, i should’ve brought my parabolic microphone."
5568,Bernadette,you’ve tried to work with him before. it hasn’t gone well. why is this time gonna be any different?
4318,Bernadette,saturday night? but i’ve been working late all week. that was gonna be our night.
3763,Bernadette,whee-ee-ee!
5178,Bernadette,you okay?
3503,Bernadette,you’re so funny. you’re like a stand-up comedian.
5472,Bernadette,"forgiven, forgiven."
4412,Bernadette,why?
4650,Bernadette,this is stupid. why are we fighting?
5883,Bernadette,"oh, please stop crying, i’m begging you. i don’t know what else to do. my boobs are empty. do you want lasagna? shh, shh, shh, it’s okay, it’s okay. shh. what have we done?"
5610,Bernadette,and bring back the bear.
4003,Bernadette,"you can make-believe, though. sometimes howard and i pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and i’m a sexy cardiologist. and the naughty part is i’m not in his hmo network."
3658,Bernadette,"well honey, if you’re that tired, why don’t you just take a nap here in the car?"
4090,Bernadette,funny. you boys have a nice time?
6076,Bernadette,"hey, that’s amazing."
5412,Bernadette,that he’s an ass? he beat you to it.
4543,Bernadette,"great, climb back up. come on."
4319,Bernadette,you’re an idiot.
4753,Bernadette,this is gonna be a long weekend for you.
3553,Bernadette,"no, you didn’t. you said leonard’s experiment was stupid."
5915,Bernadette,i like the first one.
3905,Bernadette,you’re my soul mate. this is where you kiss me.
4286,Bernadette,"what can i tell ya? she’s a big girl. wherever you look, there she is. more coffee?"
5059,Bernadette,"what? i’m, like, the sweetest person i know. look at me. i should be in a tree baking cookies."
5882,Bernadette,"it’s been wonderful, sheldon, thanks for asking."
4687,Bernadette,"well, he’s always saying i should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right."
3830,Bernadette,"guys, sorry i’m late. i have amazing news."
5238,Bernadette,i have the tool you wanted.
4127,Bernadette,i want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.
5890,Bernadette,everyone’s a better mom than me.
4998,Bernadette,"that’s for me to decide, not you."
4737,Bernadette,"hi, honey."
5689,Bernadette,no one at the office did. did you tell anyone?
4634,Bernadette,"i love raj, but that’s a long time for a house guest."
4223,Bernadette,of course you can. but maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.
5195,Bernadette,"leonard makes you watch that, too?"
5730,Bernadette,i don’t even know where to begin.
3723,Bernadette,i can’t believe we’re finally living together.
5203,Bernadette,"don’t listen to him, all she’s got is a serve. now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away."
5884,Bernadette,it took me two hours to get her down.
5582,Bernadette,"yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves."
5498,Bernadette,he’s eating. that’s a good sign.
5596,Bernadette,"actually, raj ordered it. he made me promise to wait till he was here."
5109,Bernadette,search for it.
5872,Bernadette,she did always have candy in her pocket.
5718,Bernadette,"well, my boss said he hadn’t decided yet, so i gently reminded him that he’s an old rich white guy, and i’m a sweet little pregnant lady who’s not afraid to crying front of a jury."
6126,Bernadette,"it’s okay, i serve soup to poor people!"
5777,Bernadette,that’s not helpful.
5601,Bernadette,he’s just trying to be supportive.
4563,Bernadette,"he’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?"
4754,Bernadette,i said to stop insulting each other. i didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
3695,Bernadette,they wouldn’t let me in. oh my howie.
4978,Bernadette,sorry you guys had to see that.
4076,Bernadette,we believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you.
5839,Bernadette,"thank you, but i’m not really sure."
5857,Bernadette,"i love you, too."
5458,Bernadette,"howie, i don’t want to play lego, toenail or pill anymore. so, what do you think we should do with this room?"
4294,Bernadette,don’t move. i’ll get some ice.
5573,Bernadette,can we really help?
4406,Bernadette,"well, hello, prince charming."
5613,Bernadette,i’m not hearing anything.
5757,Bernadette,you looked in our folder?!
5663,Bernadette,who’s erno rubik?
3949,Bernadette,we should play limbo next. no one beats me at limbo.
5323,Bernadette,he’ll think about it.
3608,Bernadette,knock-knock.
5682,Bernadette,anybody have anything snarky to say about that? didn’t think so.
6034,Bernadette,"when i go back to work, we’re gonna leave her with these people. we don’t know anything about them."
4691,Bernadette,"oh, thanks, but i don’twant you to close up. i mean, won’t you lose business? sorry. that was mean."
3598,Bernadette,really.
5239,Bernadette,why don’t you just call tech support?
5474,Bernadette,you know what that means.
5714,Bernadette,and a chocolate shake.
5816,Bernadette,"amy, i’m sorry, i shouldn’t have said anything."
5550,Bernadette,that’s nice.
5518,Bernadette,"so, i’m glad you guys are here. there’s something i want to share with you. howie and i are going to…"
4050,Bernadette,that sounds mean.
4104,Bernadette,no. come here. i’m still really mad at you.
5313,Bernadette,really? they didn’t eat him?
4729,Bernadette,"well, it’s just, after last time, i didn’t think you’d ever want to go back."
5209,Bernadette,"oh, that’s a lot of girl scout cookies."
4818,Bernadette,"no. my dad controlled the tv, so unless someone was a texas ranger, jake or the fatman, we didn’t see it."
6016,Bernadette,"hmm, guess it should be me."
4035,Bernadette,in may you’re gonna be on the international space station.
4555,Bernadette,"here’s what’s gonna happen. i’m gonna take a bath, and you’re gonna do the dishes."
4360,Bernadette,"oh, my god. that’s so cute. i didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you."
4706,Bernadette,should we leave?
5003,Bernadette,we brought snacks for movie night.
4496,Bernadette,be cool.
4388,Bernadette,"oh, you poor baby."
4969,Bernadette,"well, i didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy i felt that i should."
3943,Bernadette,i still think he looks like someone’s pet. maybe we should put up posters.
5528,Bernadette,i kind of already do that for howie.
5802,Bernadette,i don’t want to drive that. it’s such a mom car.
5941,Bernadette,"you may not have a house yet, but your apartment’s great."
3818,Bernadette,what?
5511,Bernadette,what could it be? we are groot? we are the champions? we are family? i got all my sisters with me?
5058,Bernadette,"well, i didn’t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore."
6053,Bernadette,"yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. do not touch that phone."
3620,Bernadette,truth.
4222,Bernadette,"i’m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it."
4796,Bernadette,why would you say that?
5429,Bernadette,maybe i should marry trent.
5012,Bernadette,"ooh, every single person rsvp’d yes. this is so exciting. isn’t this exciting?"
5432,Bernadette,just come in.
4903,Bernadette,"okay, stop."
5716,Bernadette,i just wanted to apologize. i know what you did was an accident.
3994,Bernadette,ooh!
4482,Bernadette,"come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres."
4502,Bernadette,"i just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of, sheldon."
4527,Bernadette,"come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store."
4773,Bernadette,"penny did it, i win. suck it, jackasses."
6041,Bernadette,you have everything she needs for day care?
4517,Bernadette,this is really strong oestrogen cream. please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.
5069,Bernadette,"no, it’s not. penny told me that everyone’s scared of me."
5570,Bernadette,how would you enforce it?
5817,Bernadette,"still, i can’t believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells."
4654,Bernadette,what is wrong with you?
5453,Bernadette,ignore him. he’s just using humour to express how happy he is.
5800,Bernadette,fine.
5088,Bernadette,she’s just excited about the holidays.
3569,Bernadette,"sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?"
5219,Bernadette,what’s going on in here?
5179,Bernadette,should we tell everyone not to come?
3507,Bernadette,but i need to know whether you’re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
4178,Bernadette,"i don’t know. say, being mean is lame, what’s cool is being nice."
5398,Bernadette,i took a video. i forgot how much fun this is.
4537,Bernadette,no. quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.
3809,Bernadette,i know. but if she orders something low-fat i’ll totally give her the full-fat version.
4440,Bernadette,that’s nice.
5759,Bernadette,we don’t want you to know.
5262,Bernadette,"ooh, i like when you take charge."
3913,Bernadette,"well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great."
4016,Bernadette,who’s siri? is he dating somebody new?
5512,Bernadette,yeah.
3486,Bernadette,not really.
6096,Bernadette,i signed us up for ballroom dance class.
4540,Bernadette,if you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse. unless you got some in yours. big willow.
4277,Bernadette,really? only five?
4853,Bernadette,"howie, i love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, i want a divorce."
4046,Bernadette,"hi, sweetie."
5569,Bernadette,are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours?
6144,Bernadette,"bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. so hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause santa claus is coming tonight. why’d you turn it off?"
4419,Bernadette,that’s the takeout that sheldon brought.
4970,Bernadette,like what? your incomplete set of star trek collector plates?
4807,Bernadette,how’s your soup?
5007,Bernadette,how was your prom? did you go?
4546,Bernadette,"no, she doesn’t. i just made that up."
5116,Bernadette,"okay, i learned my lesson. making fun of people is wrong."
6028,Bernadette,"i just don’t know what the right thing to do is. if i go back to work, i’m abandoning halley. if i don’t go, i’m giving up everything i worked for. it’s like there’s no right choice."
5046,Bernadette,it was your mom.
3616,Bernadette,"gee, i don’t know if i should drink more. i have to drive home, and i’ve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is."
4325,Bernadette,"bottom line, you’ll take any woman who’ll have you, right?"
3754,Bernadette,"oh, thanks."
4996,Bernadette,"because no one wants to see neil degrasse tyson in a wet t-shirt, bent over the hood of a porsche."
4683,Bernadette,"well, i need a little help. i accidentally destroyed one of howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping i could replace it."
4332,Bernadette,sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.
6010,Bernadette,"it’s okay, i’m just being emotional about this. can you not tell howard?"
6143,Bernadette,"here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus, right down santa claus lane. vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins."
4551,Bernadette,then where’s the coin?
3832,Bernadette,thank you.
3643,Bernadette,that sounds great.
5555,Bernadette,damn. all i got for valentine’s day was a postcard saying my vermont teddy bear was back-ordered.
3479,Bernadette,microbiology.
3536,Bernadette,hi.
5135,Bernadette,"well, normal’s a strong word, but sure."
5381,Bernadette,it’s an actual i’ll think about it.
4734,Bernadette,since when am i the buzzkill?
3623,Bernadette,"okay, my turn. penny, truth or dare?"
5558,Bernadette,"i’m a little tired, howie. you ready to go?"
5594,Bernadette,i don’t think so. he just wants to be part of the experience.
4638,Bernadette,"thank you, raj."
5841,Bernadette,hmm. actually i just did that this morning.
4162,Bernadette,"in the event of a divorce, please return to sheldon cooper."
3782,Bernadette,she’s also dating an astronaut.
5848,Bernadette,thank you again for cooking. it’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
4312,Bernadette,how’s the poor thing?
5325,Bernadette,"hey, if you’re open to living with someone great, i’ll give you a thousand dollars to take stuart."
5611,Bernadette,i hear that.
3522,Bernadette,what?
4381,Bernadette,"you know, compared to them, i’m feeling pretty good about us."
3963,Bernadette,i think mother teresa would have washed the clothes first.
5089,Bernadette,how?
4891,Bernadette,"okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?"
6156,Bernadette,busy like i’ll be with the baby if you go to san diego?
3920,Bernadette,"she keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other."
4858,Bernadette,please. i’m desperate.
5933,Bernadette,"stuart, don’t you drink my milk."
5041,Bernadette,"just tell me one thing that bothers you, and i promise i won’t get mad."
4915,Bernadette,why is it going so slow?
4161,Bernadette,and the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.
3883,Bernadette,no.
4667,Bernadette,"hey, so how come you two didn’t move in together?"
4651,Bernadette,you’re not a lousy husband. you’re a great husband. i was the one feeling like a lousy wife.
6127,Bernadette,why can’t she drive herself?
3893,Bernadette,i had no choice. i had to tell his mother. he can’t go to space. he’s like a baby bird. do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?
5479,Bernadette,i’m sure it was harmless. people flirt. no big deal.
5966,Bernadette,no.
3628,Bernadette,"ooh, like what?"
6082,Bernadette,really? he doesn’t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?
4837,Bernadette,"i’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work."
5468,Bernadette,maybe he uses kryptonite.
5536,Bernadette,you guys can go in if you want.
3676,Bernadette,"howard, stop it."
6022,Bernadette,something on your mind?
4374,Bernadette,"oh, bite me."
4956,Bernadette,then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.
5337,Bernadette,are you attracted to him?
4696,Bernadette,"not from you. let’s go, stuart."
5098,Bernadette,you okay?
4986,Bernadette,"so, what are you working on these days?"
3812,Bernadette,"all right. here you go. two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for priya."
4125,Bernadette,this is the most amazing gift i’ve ever gotten.
5289,Bernadette,"you know, if you think about it, without you, he never would’ve grown into the person he is now. i mean, sure, more women might notice him, but i think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice."
6011,Bernadette,"don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?"
4493,Bernadette,i was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.
4237,Bernadette,just what?
5684,Bernadette,okay. i now pronounce you husband and wife. and weird other husband who came with the apartment.
5669,Bernadette,"oh, stop. you know what’s really happening? all the movies you’ve watched, the tv shows, the comic books, they’ve completely twisted your thinking. no one’s after you, no one’s listening to you, no one cares about you."
5048,Bernadette,"okay, um, i love that you make me laugh."
4695,Bernadette,i don’t think i like the way you’re treating my friend.
3523,Bernadette,why not?
3675,Bernadette,you can’t think that way.
4565,Bernadette,"excuse me, i need to have a chat with my husband."
4521,Bernadette,"it’s okay. you still look great to me. in fact, why don’t we go in the bedroom and i’ll prove it to you?"
3682,Bernadette,thanks. i’ll sleep on the floor.
5237,Bernadette,"well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist."
4670,Bernadette,"well, stuart’s cute in his own way."
4036,Bernadette,that is big.
3758,Bernadette,"yes, i will marry you."
6019,Bernadette,fine.
4733,Bernadette,"well, i’m his wife, i don’t want to ruin it for him."
4483,Bernadette,"this may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master."
5146,Bernadette,eight sixteen.
4881,Bernadette,not much. you want to get a drink later? just the two of us?
6109,Bernadette,"yeah, there’s a million reasons a woman would shoot raj down."
3649,Bernadette,hi.
5425,Bernadette,who’s trent?
6038,Bernadette,"no, i’ll be fine. "
4350,Bernadette,"it’s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist."
4058,Bernadette,"howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home. it won’t change how i feel about you."
6017,Bernadette,"of course, why?"
4239,Bernadette,"no, i’m not. i married him. on purpose. come here."
3866,Bernadette,i just told him that!
4547,Bernadette,"because you were about to quit like a big, sheldon, cover your ears."
3574,Bernadette,i know how to deal with stubborn children. my mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.
3660,Bernadette,"oh. thank you, raj."
4462,Bernadette,"no, i wasn’t."
5727,Bernadette,isn’t it a little early for that?
4039,Bernadette,that depends. do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?
5998,Bernadette,"let’s see, the magic store, the doctor who convention, the national belt buckle collector’s meet and greet."
5321,Bernadette,stuart. he’s been living with us for a while now. i’m sure he’d love to get us out of his hair.
3890,Bernadette,i love you.
4033,Bernadette,"and just to be safe, when you talk to him, don’t bring up jimmy carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, sean penn, vatican ii, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you’re jewish."
4255,Bernadette,you ready to go?
4047,Bernadette,"i miss you, too. so tell me all about your first day."
5705,Bernadette,get out.
3746,Bernadette,i took howard to the beach once. he almost burst into flames like a vampire.
4875,Bernadette,"hey, don’t you take that sarcastic tone with him."
5071,Bernadette,no problem. when does that start?
4405,Bernadette,"yes, and i have a surprise for you."
4347,Bernadette,what kind of comics do the guys like?
4804,Bernadette,"you’re kidding, right?"
5842,Bernadette,"i did that, too."
5368,Bernadette,then how ’bout the bathroom?
5163,Bernadette,"yeah, we should."
5822,Bernadette,you do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
3833,Bernadette,"well, you’ll be really be proud of this. i was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. they’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!"
4285,Bernadette,"i don’t have to take this. i’m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. maybe i’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. which sounds dirty, but i didn’t mean it that way,"
5907,Bernadette,"uh oh, what’s going on?"
5087,Bernadette,"come on, sheldon, you have to get her something."
5225,Bernadette,trying to hurt raj’s feelings.
6130,Bernadette,ew. excuse me.
4433,Bernadette,"yeah, try doing it in heels."
5786,Bernadette,i told you raccoons don’t say uh-oh.
5635,Bernadette,"i’m sorry, i have to ask."
3577,Bernadette,i believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.
6002,Bernadette,no problem.
5017,Bernadette,"aw, that movie’s so cute."
4694,Bernadette,hey.
4690,Bernadette,"oh, that’s terrible. what’s the address?"
4909,Bernadette,think he’s getting any better?
4788,Bernadette,i like the wii.
5253,Bernadette,"well, then i guess bring a blanket. the grass gets damp at night."
5504,Bernadette,"oh, terrific."
5704,Bernadette,why did you do that?
5335,Bernadette,what can it hurt?
4709,Bernadette,yeah. or you’d be the oldest one here.
3750,Bernadette,count your blessings you’re not a tanzanian chimp.
4140,Bernadette,"oh, i like that."
3972,Bernadette,"you know, i-it’s just that i’m not that comfortable with little kids."
6083,Bernadette,"you’re still gonna go, right?"
3495,Bernadette,not on a bicycle. in a camry.
4463,Bernadette,"yeah, well, you throw like a girl."
4309,Bernadette,terrific. my two favorite fellas gone fishin’.
4249,Bernadette,good.
3805,Bernadette,i’m not upset. maybe you’re upset.
4297,Bernadette,you hit her! what did i do?
4364,Bernadette,"$5,000 for a couple of dolls? are you out of your mind?"
5947,Bernadette,"oh, i’m sure that’s not true."
5943,Bernadette,careful. the sound of crying can make me lactate.
4673,Bernadette,what happened?
4731,Bernadette,he hated that entire experience. does it make me an awful wife if i don’t think he should do it again?
6063,Bernadette,"hey, i didn’t know you were home. where you been?"
6101,Bernadette,should we call amy?
3619,Bernadette,"no, just the one. but it’s really long."
5934,Bernadette,you guys got this? do you need me to come home?
4452,Bernadette,why does this bother you so much?
3533,Bernadette,are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?
5444,Bernadette,"yeah, but he also swore this was the year he’d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin."
5353,Bernadette,and i’d love to take you out again”?
4051,Bernadette,"sure, why?"
5400,Bernadette,"ugh, i hear that."
3800,Bernadette,this trip to india sounds fun.
5775,Bernadette,"uh, i left my phone downstairs."
3806,Bernadette,i can’t do this anymore! i’m a good girl! i went to catholic school! 
5470,Bernadette,i brought you a little care package from work. it’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.
6024,Bernadette,"no, what is wrong with you?"
6110,Bernadette,"fine, hundreds."
6027,Bernadette,it was?
5858,Bernadette,here comes another contraction.
3634,Bernadette,here we go.
4882,Bernadette,not tonight. i’m a little frustrated with her.
4114,Bernadette,what? we’re getting married that sunday.
3928,Bernadette,"amy, you’re not a tumour. penny, tell her she’s not a tumour. . "
5176,Bernadette,thanks.
5320,Bernadette,hey. you know who would be the perfect roomie?
5488,Bernadette,are you gonna tell emily?
4305,Bernadette,you could die.
4043,Bernadette,"i’ve got to go. i’ve got to get up early. my company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring."
3738,Bernadette,"but you could if you wanted to, right?"
5021,Bernadette,that’s jeanie?
4394,Bernadette,"so, what do you say? this friday we ditch work and go to disneyland?"
3785,Bernadette,"obviously, this one doesn’t."
6084,Bernadette,"well, distance might be nice. the last time a big project ended for howie, he wouldn’t stop following me around. he even went with me to get a mammogram."
4940,Bernadette,i’ll check hotels.
4548,Bernadette,wish i had a man like her on my team.
4085,Bernadette,"oh, damn. i’m sorry, i can’t make it, but sheldon’s going to go with you! and that’s the last thing you do to him."
4767,Bernadette,"hey, what about this? it looks like a receipt."
5215,Bernadette,why don’t you help with the coffee?
5382,Bernadette,i know you would.
5649,Bernadette,"wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than i thought."
5572,Bernadette,we heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.
4684,Bernadette,batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.
3842,Bernadette,of course you do. you’re a cutie pie. any girl would be lucky to have you.
4186,Bernadette,i got to get back to work. i love you.
5866,Bernadette,"here comes another one. hey, squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right."
5676,Bernadette,"howard, please just call the man, see what he wants."
4040,Bernadette,what will you tell amy?
5527,Bernadette,doctor said i can’t go in the hot tub.
4101,Bernadette,"no, leave me alone."
4785,Bernadette,am i a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?
3874,Bernadette,fine. just a little tired.
3492,Bernadette,"okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you’re nine years old?"
5437,Bernadette,"yeah, are you ready for this?"
6105,Bernadette,which he only did once.
3823,Bernadette,how can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?
4147,Bernadette,"howard joel wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. i love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever."
3770,Bernadette,"oh, i’m sorry, i’m engaged."
5378,Bernadette,"oh, please. mom did everything. all you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. how is that raising kids?"
3671,Bernadette,six-seven.
5183,Bernadette,"oh, that’s fine."
5304,Bernadette,did you change yours to married yet?
4023,Bernadette,if i ever actually ever get married.
4210,Bernadette,"now, kiss me. "
5212,Bernadette,"oh, let me do it, howard."
5722,Bernadette,it’s okay.
4792,Bernadette,"poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. she’s alive, but she’s still in critical condition."
5743,Bernadette,i don’t know.
4021,Bernadette,turn it over. i’m hoping my relatives think it’s hebrew.
5389,Bernadette,"i’ll just call the restaurant, pretend i’m amy and check the reservation."
4366,Bernadette,"i don’t believe you. howie, we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this."
4781,Bernadette,"so on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “hey, vivian. you deserve this. and at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”"
4330,Bernadette,why would you say that?
4912,Bernadette,he’s so nice.
5415,Bernadette,what difference does it make?
3749,Bernadette,i don’t have an urge to fling my waste.
4351,Bernadette,"i don’t think it’s heavy. it’s some sort of magic, so only thor can lift it."
3776,Bernadette,"well, what makes me the weakest member?"
3902,Bernadette,i know.
3917,Bernadette,"oh, me."
4669,Bernadette,"raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch penny’s thing tonight, i didn’t think you meant stuart."
4871,Bernadette,"i never thought i’d say this, but penny got a job today."
4920,Bernadette,did she say she didn’t like you?
3825,Bernadette,"okay, well, wish me luck."
4620,Bernadette,"i don’t know. he’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome. "
5210,Bernadette,"you know, i’m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures."
6085,Bernadette,"no, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple’s massage."
4532,Bernadette,"hey, romeo. repair your relationship on your own time."
5712,Bernadette,"well, you brought me french fries. that’s a start."
4768,Bernadette,for a cup of coffee. but it’s dated 20 years from now.
4759,Bernadette,"hi, stuart."
4017,Bernadette,oh. is that cute or creepy?
3532,Bernadette,that’s amazing.
5957,Bernadette,"you want something stupid, or you did something stupid?"
5792,Bernadette,"oh, yeah, that’s where i put it."
4267,Bernadette,i’m starting to think you’re right.
4568,Bernadette,is it my voice? am i too bossy? what?
5482,Bernadette,"howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this."
4762,Bernadette,"all right, if i’m doing this, i’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed stuart?"
4617,Bernadette,"okay, he cares about you a lot."
3477,Bernadette,"speaking of underwear, i have some interesting news."
3858,Bernadette,"no. i need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour."
5752,Bernadette,it would help if you stopped telling me i have a textbook cervix.
5693,Bernadette,i had a plan. i kept leaving dove bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.
3630,Bernadette,i might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
4995,Bernadette,"amy, what did you say?"
4469,Bernadette,it’s fine. where’d you get that picture of her?
3614,Bernadette,"penny, your nails look great."
3487,Bernadette,i use them. i don’t like them.
5495,Bernadette,"no. no, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. we need to save it."
4329,Bernadette,"i’m sorry, raj."
5824,Bernadette,who is it?
3591,Bernadette,thank you.
4012,Bernadette,ooh!
3563,Bernadette,"no, thank you."
5397,Bernadette,nothing. not important.
4214,Bernadette,leonard does thing he doesn’t like to make you happy.
4261,Bernadette,or in the closet. we can decide later.
5821,Bernadette,are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
4558,Bernadette,and i’m not buying it. try again.
5811,Bernadette,fine. i’ll buy the stupid van.
4943,Bernadette,you sure?
4622,Bernadette,what are they doing?
4716,Bernadette,see? it’s not just sheldon. they’re all idiots.
5795,Bernadette,the next person kicking you will be me. good night.
3725,Bernadette,"no. i, i might have some cheddar."
5937,Bernadette,what’s going on with you?
5147,Bernadette,just drop it.
6032,Bernadette,i’m on the day care’s website.
6049,Bernadette,see? this is the right thing for her. let’s all just go to work.
4060,Bernadette,surprise.
4306,Bernadette,"so, dad, have you done any fishing lately?"
5403,Bernadette,we got to get out of here.
4727,Bernadette,what are you talking about?
5868,Bernadette,we could name her after your mom.
4730,Bernadette,really? ‘cause i kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.
3732,Bernadette,"all right, howard, let’s get something straight right now. i’m not going to be your mother."
4344,Bernadette,the comic book store isn’t far from here.
4392,Bernadette,weekends are too crowded.
5772,Bernadette,that feels great.
5526,Bernadette,doctor said i can’t have sushi.
4567,Bernadette,what exactly do you think you’d get sick of?
4144,Bernadette,"here you go? what am i, a football?"
6031,Bernadette,i don’t like when you imitate me.
3910,Bernadette,"you are. i’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot."
4098,Bernadette,wait a minute. you set me up with howard. did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?
4192,Bernadette,"come on, howard. no one’s leaving you up there."
4616,Bernadette,"don’t be silly, he loves you."
3919,Bernadette,i told you that would happen.
3588,Bernadette,"what about you, have you been seeing anybody?"
4772,Bernadette,what the hell?
3583,Bernadette,too bad.
5806,Bernadette,"oh, is it your back?"
4880,Bernadette,couldn’t hurt.
5291,Bernadette,"come on, leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. you sure we can’t take you to a strip club?"
4129,Bernadette,"so anyway, we decided to go down to city hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when howard gets back."
5629,Bernadette,so what do you want to do tonight?
5049,Bernadette,"and yet, i still love when you hold a door for me."
5499,Bernadette,he’s pretty cute.
5038,Bernadette,"i’m not joking, howie. you heard what he said about his parents. it was the little things they kept bottled up. i don’t want that to happen to us."
5045,Bernadette,was it your mom?
5920,Bernadette,"let’s see. you’re better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don’t have to be us."
6068,Bernadette,"okay, it’s not like i wanted to be a ventriloquist. i was in beauty pageants and i needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant."
4587,Bernadette,"howie, stop. come on, look at what i’m making."
4372,Bernadette,should we go back and rescue him?
6090,Bernadette,oh.
3936,Bernadette,"oh, amy! looking sexy!"
4738,Bernadette,maybe you should have a seat.
3497,Bernadette,i’d love some.
5156,Bernadette,"oh, no. that thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom."
4323,Bernadette,"yeah, you’re a real catch. i know you’re shy, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have someone wonderful in your life."
3526,Bernadette,where’d you get them?
5532,Bernadette,"well, sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and i went out…"
6036,Bernadette,it’s not just the sloth. polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. the orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. and what do i do? i choose my career over my child.
5614,Bernadette,"wait, that’s it."
3838,Bernadette,what the hell is wrong with you?
4866,Bernadette,"maybe. but like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. anyway, i talked you up to dan. he’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you."
5508,Bernadette,we’ll find another time to tell him i’m pregnant.
3672,Bernadette,is something bothering you?
5438,Bernadette,so where do you want to go?
5475,Bernadette,this is so cool.
5223,Bernadette,is this about the space probe he’s working on without you?
4232,Bernadette,and albert einstein?
5696,Bernadette,i forgot my coat.
5799,Bernadette,sounds expensive.
4636,Bernadette,"hey, guys. sorry i’m so late. did you already have dinner?"
5469,Bernadette,we could do a double feature with the leonardo di caprio romeo and juliet.
4128,Bernadette,"we’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back."
5347,Bernadette,"oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?"
4200,Bernadette,he’s coming back from outer space.
4608,Bernadette,"hi, dad."
6056,Bernadette,is it i’m going to die alone?
4846,Bernadette,you were right.
3968,Bernadette,"oh, you have a lot of magic stuff."
5721,Bernadette,"you believe me? oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, i’ll have the jury eating out of my hand."
6054,Bernadette,so you wanted to learn something physical and you came to howard wolowitz?
5991,Bernadette,good. nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.
5981,Bernadette,"don’t post that, be supportive."
4743,Bernadette,now i feel bad.
5399,Bernadette,why’d you bring him?
5641,Bernadette,you bet.
4962,Bernadette,would you please close the drapes?
4443,Bernadette,"sit down, honey."
5305,Bernadette,what?
4220,Bernadette,"howie, i know you went to space. i’m incredibly proud of you. but you might want to try and not bring it up every minute."
3572,Bernadette,"right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed."
5169,Bernadette,"howie, what’s wrong?"
4466,Bernadette,thanks.
3708,Bernadette,"howard, have you ever considered us living together?"
5616,Bernadette,"hey, raj."
5923,Bernadette,sorry. howie’s back at work and there’s just so much going on.
5407,Bernadette,you said that sounded like the worst thing ever.
5333,Bernadette,"oh. look at you, two guys in one day."
5845,Bernadette,"there’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess."
4472,Bernadette,"so you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?"
3973,Bernadette,"mmm, yeah, sure."
3876,Bernadette,i just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.
5206,Bernadette,"you know, amy, i, uh, can’t help but wonder how sheldon would react if the tardis was at your place."
3790,Bernadette,"he can’t have a hobby? excuse me, i have to pee. or is that implausible, as well?"
3654,Bernadette,what’s the matter?
3892,Bernadette,i’m ready.
3760,Bernadette,"oh, i love you, too."
5224,Bernadette,"howard, you’re grown men. you guys don’t have to do everything together."
4026,Bernadette,i just don’t know how i’m gonna break it to him.
4428,Bernadette,really? are you sure?
5788,Bernadette,why wouldn’t he tell us? are we bad friends?
3827,Bernadette,your mother just taught it to me. she thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure i was okay.
4907,Bernadette,just throw the ball. let’s see what we’re working with.
4156,Bernadette,"listen, mister, you’re gonna talk to your mother and you’re gonna fix this, or that thing i said i was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself."
5908,Bernadette,"it’s okay, howie never has on pants. the domino’s guy brings the pizza like this now."
3933,Bernadette,"we’re just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?"
5373,Bernadette,he’s not on my side. he’s doing all the work for free.
5754,Bernadette,what if it’s a girl?
3710,Bernadette,what?
3719,Bernadette,what did she say when you told her?
5881,Bernadette,sure.
4560,Bernadette,"so, amy, what are you gonna be working on at caltech?"
4055,Bernadette,poor baby.
5297,Bernadette,good for you.
5744,Bernadette,"raj, why don’t i care about anything?"
6111,Bernadette,can i just squeeze in here?
5592,Bernadette,"yeah, ever since you told him i was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me."
4604,Bernadette,"well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s only coffee, just relax and see what happens."
5492,Bernadette,"uh, wish we had a skimmer."
4821,Bernadette,girl sprouts?
3717,Bernadette,agh!
4830,Bernadette,taking care of your own mother? how can you say that?
6006,Bernadette,"yeah, i mean, i’ll miss halley, but it’ll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch."
3971,Bernadette,"listen, howie, maybe i’m not the best choice to be a magician’s assistant."
5710,Bernadette,"i’ve worked so hard to get where i am, and i don’t want to get sent back to square one because i’m pregnant."
5080,Bernadette,it’s not okay. how can i even work here anymore?
5259,Bernadette,maybe raj is right. maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out.
4718,Bernadette,"oh, sure you did. who’s mama’s big space man?"
5249,Bernadette,"yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?"
5406,Bernadette,"and raj and i are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless."
4182,Bernadette,"oh, howie."
5384,Bernadette,"ooh, tall. finally some details about this mystery man."
3836,Bernadette,"oh, you let me worry about the money. i just want my baby to have pretty things."
4153,Bernadette,"you said you told her, but you never did!"
3820,Bernadette,you told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?
4675,Bernadette,that’s interesting.
3535,Bernadette,who are all those people?
4535,Bernadette,"don’t sweat it, my dad’s a cop. he can fix things."
5261,Bernadette,all right. tonight’s the night.
5948,Bernadette,"yeah, maybe your dad’s right."
4595,Bernadette,that’s lucy?
3826,Bernadette,you’re a putz. you know what that means?
5815,Bernadette,one sec. why did you tell leonard i told you penny was hiding his things?
5266,Bernadette,"so, we need to talk."
4179,Bernadette,do you want me to call somebody at nasa?
3937,Bernadette,thank you.
3559,Bernadette,"oh, we’re way past second base. right, howard?"
5346,Bernadette,can you show us that dating app?
3609,Bernadette,olive.
5374,Bernadette,aftershock.
5588,Bernadette,"come on, raj, give me a bag."
3772,Bernadette,some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.
5583,Bernadette,"okay. okay, how about this? they don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. when they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out."
4066,Bernadette,"sorry, i just thought it’d be nice if people knew we were a couple."
4005,Bernadette,"sure, we’d love that. change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this."
4516,Bernadette,let me see. how long have you been putting this on her?
4919,Bernadette,last night was fun. what did you think of emily?
5692,Bernadette,"i know they would, they did it to barbara chen last year when i told everyone she was pregnant."
5001,Bernadette,"oh, good, you’re here. amy, i am so sorry."
4808,Bernadette,where are you going?
5365,Bernadette,"okay, listen, i’m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house."
4437,Bernadette,i’m sorry.
4386,Bernadette,did something good happen?
5232,Bernadette,"well, i’m glad you have a new appreciation for your job."
4749,Bernadette,serial ape-ist? i thought you died in that.
4500,Bernadette,i don’t know what i’m saying.
5840,Bernadette,i guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes.
4276,Bernadette,"we’re so proud of you, amy. your first bikini wax."
3562,Bernadette,"so, what should we talk about?"
5779,Bernadette,who would use our hot tub?
5655,Bernadette,"well, we don’t exactly. i’m a microbiologist for the research team."
5279,Bernadette,that’s true.
3991,Bernadette,"yeah. you know, you’ll watch barney and pull cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and i’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life."
4324,Bernadette,"we’ll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you."
5847,Bernadette,"yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that."
3903,Bernadette,really? you got seasick on pirates of the caribbean.
5030,Bernadette,"oh, muffin much."
5310,Bernadette,it’s understandable. amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with sheldon.
6000,Bernadette,"oh, then maybe you shouldn’t talk to her."
5050,Bernadette,"uh-huh. and i love that i work and do all the cleaning, and you’re okay with that."
4308,Bernadette,"howie, i think you’d have fun."
4519,Bernadette,that’s ’cause i’m a woman. i’ve had years of practice riding the dragon.
4655,Bernadette,"good idea, i’ll take a picture."
4137,Bernadette,"no, isn’t that kind of tacky?"
5039,Bernadette,"well, is there anything about me you’re keeping inside?"
4000,Bernadette,why do you think he asked you out again?
5086,Bernadette,"okay, new subject. let’s talk about presents. what did you get amy?"
5112,Bernadette,"please, can we watch it?"
5207,Bernadette,"if this doesn’t get him into your bedroom, nothing will."
4906,Bernadette,"okay, it’s not that hard. you just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it."
6113,Bernadette,to do what? shake a can of nickels at them?
3647,Bernadette,"well, this was fun."
5355,Bernadette,what?
4936,Bernadette,"oh. howie, i had no idea."
4219,Bernadette,"okay, we need to talk."
4523,Bernadette,maybe we can do it next week.
6118,Bernadette,my desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!
5565,Bernadette,i just want to make sure you’ve thought this through.
5446,Bernadette,"no, it’s okay."
5031,Bernadette,he’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry. tough crowd.
3773,Bernadette,we’re really not that close.
5729,Bernadette,i don’t think you are.
3769,Bernadette,"muy caliente, sheldon!"
5863,Bernadette,raj.
3888,Bernadette,"no, i’ve just been thinking. it doesn’t matter if i’m afraid for your safety. i don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams."
5926,Bernadette,that sounds really nice.
4444,Bernadette,"inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. on the back he wrote howard, my son, my greatest gift. you okay?"
4315,Bernadette,i don’t understand.
5709,Bernadette,"are you kidding? i’ve always been treated differently. look at me. listen to me. i mean, the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist, it’s i wonder if her mommy"
3500,Bernadette,i don’t really get it.
3528,Bernadette,"don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour."
5454,Bernadette,"sure he does. well, let us know when you’re all settled in."
4456,Bernadette,"yeah, you two were so cute playing together."
3707,Bernadette,go home.
5252,Bernadette,"the only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it’s two consenting adults, i guess i don’t see the harm in it."
4935,Bernadette,it just seems like a risky investment.
4862,Bernadette,"yeah. i don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural."
5251,Bernadette,you mean ’cause she has weird tattoos?
5832,Bernadette,i can’t imagine you being violent.
5490,Bernadette,"look at that, you shaved it all."
3538,Bernadette,"so, how’s your experiment going?"
4410,Bernadette,"well, you don’t know that. what if someone’s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?"
5586,Bernadette,it’s okay. they apologized.
4207,Bernadette,"took some benadryl. i’ll be fine. so, did you miss me?"
4699,Bernadette,"well, that sounds even better."
5531,Bernadette,"fine. we were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous."
5228,Bernadette,"don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?"
4416,Bernadette,you stopped and got him takeout?
5292,Bernadette,"oh, look, jewish and gentile."
4111,Bernadette,"oh, howie, that’s wonderful!"
3840,Bernadette,"damn right, you’re sorry. and you tell howard there’s never been anything between us."
4432,Bernadette,i can’t do that. what kind of wife would i be if i didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?
5607,Bernadette,yeah.
4064,Bernadette,pew!
5774,Bernadette,"lock the door, lock the door."
3918,Bernadette,that’s so sweet.
4018,Bernadette,i don’t know if i want to stay.
4905,Bernadette,i’m looking at it.
4193,Bernadette,you’re going to be fine. you survived that weight watchers cruise with your mom. and they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
3482,Bernadette,are you sure?
4461,Bernadette,"well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller."
4857,Bernadette,you’re not working. how would you like a job in home health care?
4025,Bernadette,yeah. howie’s gonna freak out.
6023,Bernadette,"nope, all good."
5494,Bernadette,"i’m gonna put this down your robe. it’s not moving, but i think it’s still alive."
5433,Bernadette,sure.
5781,Bernadette,should we say something to him?
3779,Bernadette,i don’t know. i’m not a very good liar. they kind of whup that out of you in catholic school.
5067,Bernadette,"dan, could i talk to you for a minute?"
3506,Bernadette,sex.
5455,Bernadette,our pleasure.
3998,Bernadette,yes.
4576,Bernadette,why tomorrow?
5303,Bernadette,"amy, i noticed your status still says in a relationship on facebook."
3517,Bernadette,"oh, thanks."
3794,Bernadette,they said something about going there this summer.
4541,Bernadette,can you reach the clue?
4698,Bernadette,"no, i don’t want a latte. i want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone. "
3709,Bernadette,"no, i mean just you and me. you can move in here, or we can find a place."
5976,Bernadette,and you live here for free.
5009,Bernadette,easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.
4883,Bernadette,"so it’s not just me. you see it, too."
5898,Bernadette,don’t make me laugh.
3795,Bernadette,i don’t know. i was too busy covering my heinie on amy’s stupid astronaut story!
4899,Bernadette,"great. and while we’re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound."
5190,Bernadette,of course.
5248,Bernadette,"okay, i don’t know when i became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. you guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom."
5405,Bernadette,"hi, ames, what are you doing here?"
5264,Bernadette,"howard joel wolowitz, you get back here."
4609,Bernadette,"oh, you brought beer for everybody."
5013,Bernadette,"look, even stuart’s bringing a date. i wonder who it is."
3797,Bernadette,"yeah, it’s hysterical."
4975,Bernadette,"well, maybe i would have paid it if i wasn’t also doing everything else around here."
5189,Bernadette,"sweetie, we have a lot to do. we don’t need to decide this right now."
5523,Bernadette,"you’re probably right. after we talked about it, he started to calm down."
5005,Bernadette,"wow, you still have it? i just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere."
4900,Bernadette,"all right, the pitcher’s mound in major league baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate."
5713,Bernadette,apple slices? what kind of lunatic goes to mcdonald’s and gets fruit?
5307,Bernadette,"yeah, isn’t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?"
5113,Bernadette,"well, maybe it turned out better than you think."
3560,Bernadette,"how’s your work going, penny? any acting jobs?"
4290,Bernadette,"well, that doesn’t make sense, either."
5801,Bernadette,you bought a minivan?
4271,Bernadette,she’s lucky you were there.
4106,Bernadette,okay.
6147,Bernadette,earthquake.
3596,Bernadette,"well, we could’ve been having sex, but you never made the move."
5930,Bernadette,"not yet, but we’re gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open."
5367,Bernadette,how ’bout this one?
4336,Bernadette,"sheldon, you need to talk to alex right away."
5060,Bernadette,"oh, yeah? you one of those people?"
5953,Bernadette,what if you stop helping?
3496,Bernadette,oh!
5463,Bernadette,have you heard from him since he left?
4736,Bernadette,"you’re right, it’s great."
5187,Bernadette,"you know, you can leave one side up and play against it."
5385,Bernadette,did you kiss him yet?
4089,Bernadette,"howard already took care of it. plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. do you know, for a while in poland, my family and his family were neighbours."
6114,Bernadette,excuse me.
4685,Bernadette,do you have this one?
5646,Bernadette,does it have eyes?
4238,Bernadette,plain old howard wolowitz is the best guy i know.
4672,Bernadette,or just keep dating the possum.
5828,Bernadette,"howie, it’s in poor taste."
5750,Bernadette,but i thought i’d be more excited.
3640,Bernadette,"right. help, i’m a prisoner in a chinese fortune cookie factory."
3958,Bernadette,you’re doing great.
5375,Bernadette,so i should probably explain why i kind of fibbed.
3650,Bernadette,he’s really cute. how do you know him?
4354,Bernadette,you want some tea?
5064,Bernadette,"okay, sorry. can we just go? i feel like everybody hates me."
4524,Bernadette,should we just do couples?
5587,Bernadette,should we invite raj?
4197,Bernadette,"hey, howie, how you feeling?"
4001,Bernadette,maybe.
66,Amy,agreed. and we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow.
1878,Amy,it’s nice they’re getting exercise.
2632,Amy,i’m surprised you would do that.
3154,Amy,"okay, literally any other topic."
1411,Amy,right now? why?
1883,Amy,fifty six.
3464,Amy,"hi, sheldon."
574,Amy,"oh, yes. our relationship agreement specifies that the second thursday of every month, or the third thursday in a month with five thursdays, is date night."
2627,Amy,"ooh, that sounds cozy."
1986,Amy,i haven’t learned my lesson. play it. play it.
499,Amy,"this is us. bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. penny, you’re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. and where’s amy? she’s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with."
297,Amy,i’m giving him emphysema. the least i can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
2452,Amy,i think i should leave.
577,Amy,"that’s nice. anyway, i’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time."
2396,Amy,"that’s okay. come on in. thank you. um, i’ll, i’m gonna go put these in water."
1757,Amy,so when do you guys plan on getting married?
95,Amy,"yes, and continue to bond. i have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. or bff, if you prefer. which i don’t."
1362,Amy,"rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?"
292,Amy,would you like to come in for a nightcap?
2207,Amy,good-bye.
2127,Amy,probably not. it’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.
3393,Amy,"it’s so strange, earlier today i ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren’t there to correct my grammar."
2735,Amy,"well, i came to see how you were feeling, but i’m guessing still angry?"
1989,Amy,"no, please don’t."
168,Amy,that does seem to be a valid principle.
1441,Amy,oh.
364,Amy,don’t be so hard on yourself. do you know the story of catherine the great?
2481,Amy,your friend is hurting.
1607,Amy,you’ll get offered something soon.
356,Amy,"trust me. with your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process."
2872,Amy,"um, it was a drywall problem."
1960,Amy,"and if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?"
968,Amy,"all right, all right. but i really was sick at the beginning. it’s just been so nice having you take care of me."
849,Amy,"penny, aren’t you gonna draw something?"
77,Amy,"sheldon, please, you’re suffocating me."
31,Amy,perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. we’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.
1073,Amy,and you picked me.
1301,Amy,"where are we going with this, dr. cooper?"
2302,Amy,"that’s, um, terrific. listen, i’m, i’m kind of tired. can we call it a night?"
248,Amy,"primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. bernadette’s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at priya is hard-wired into her dna."
2556,Amy,sheldon.
1269,Amy,"no, i do, and if he weren’t in the movie, the nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. let me close that for ya."
1118,Amy,"no, it’s not."
713,Amy,i panicked and said woodstock. i just wanted to show sheldon off to my family.
2143,Amy,pg. some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
9,Amy,neurobiologist. your check engine light is on.
3105,Amy,i’m sorry leonard and penny hurt your feelings.
2580,Amy,but why wouldn’t…
3165,Amy,yeah?
882,Amy,you guys have got to be the weirdest couple i know.
457,Amy,how did wil wheaton get on the list?
2314,Amy,oh. okay. thank you.
2644,Amy,"oh, sheldon, i never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating."
3354,Amy,"sheldon, you’re, you’re being silly."
3223,Amy,you okay?
1365,Amy,"oh, my gosh. that’s the girl that broke rajesh’s heart."
2109,Amy,can i be in charge of pricing? i’ve been going to garage sales my whole life. can you believe i got these pantyhose for a nickel?
3025,Amy,"that’s not a real thing, he’s just joking."
1700,Amy,"don’t i know it. what is that, polenta?"
2995,Amy,"well, first deliveries can be slow."
1078,Amy,"subtle, but powerful."
2798,Amy,i’m so sore. i don’t think i slept two minutes last night.
649,Amy,i want a real apology.
2692,Amy,fine.
1307,Amy,"i can’t leave now, sheldon. i’m very busy. besides, why would i want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? image number four, boa constrictor. "
1217,Amy,your brainy virgin kind of sounds like sheldon.
1987,Amy,play it again. play it again.
360,Amy,don’t flatter yourself. your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. i could just as easily have paralyzed you.
862,Amy,ladies night at the cheesecake factory. does it get any better than this?
1573,Amy,and i’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.
2983,Amy,i’ve got the neosporin. who got hurt?
2618,Amy,"come on, sheldon, let’s go with them."
1852,Amy,my date would’ve had to clean that up.
3278,Amy,you need sleep.
3042,Amy,he’s been in there a long time. should i go talk to him?
3095,Amy,yes. i’m looking at puppi
1331,Amy,"you and me both, brother. it doesn’t matter. the element was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking."
3146,Amy,"oh, really. anybody we know?"
431,Amy,"i have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you."
493,Amy,"come on, tumour. come on, tumour, mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. yay, brain tumour! probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news."
929,Amy,what do you think?
2019,Amy,that’s not true.
1410,Amy,"well, i have an extremely low centre of gravity. i’m like a pyramid."
2097,Amy,do you need any help in the kitchen?
2449,Amy,"look, i, i get that you’re protective of your grandson, but he’s an adult now. maybe i understand what he needs better than you do."
1094,Amy,i can’t believe i ditched work for disneyland.
1133,Amy,the fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic. it makes us?
1008,Amy,"ooh, i do love a bad boy."
502,Amy,"well, i came here to get a bottle of wine like penny taught me to do when you’re sad."
1417,Amy,it’s great. it’s christmastime and jimmy stewart’s really depressed and he’s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.
3022,Amy,bernadette got her doctorate.
3457,Amy,"i’m not gonna be your roommate, sheldon."
1936,Amy,sheldon?
1840,Amy,but what about the other girl?
1198,Amy,"good night. no, i will not consider sleeping in my garment bag."
323,Amy,"oh, no. you have to go."
212,Amy,"oh, who are you kidding? she’s breathtaking."
1161,Amy,i got some old underwear i’m gonna throw on stage at the garth brooks concert.
2784,Amy,doesn’t matter to me. your choice.
2728,Amy,"well, whatever happens, we’re here for you."
3360,Amy,"well, i haven’t accepted it yet. i wanted to talk to you first."
3312,Amy,"i’m pretty sure that’s a myth, let me check."
973,Amy,that’s true. i’ve been a very bad girl.
81,Amy,"actually, as the newest member of your social group, i believe i’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time."
2856,Amy,"no, stuart, don’t."
949,Amy,"but our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them."
668,Amy,i feel like an idiot.
2003,Amy,sure.
2892,Amy,thank you for understanding.
571,Amy,"check it out, bernadette, suede boots, your size."
2607,Amy,"baby steps, i guess."
2008,Amy,"well, i’d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and i thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it’s not a big deal."
3285,Amy,phones can do that?
2289,Amy,"oh, i’m, i’m so sorry."
786,Amy,i don’t understand. what’s he doing here?
2759,Amy,about five weeks.
1249,Amy,such as?
256,Amy,"what if he’s right? and by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?"
1136,Amy,i’d like to know why penny’s here.
1601,Amy,of course.
1404,Amy,okay.
2936,Amy,not right now.
3181,Amy,"look at you, going to comic-con, talking about ewoks. i really have become the cool one around here."
846,Amy,"uh, box? uh, window?"
1464,Amy,"that’s okay. uh, bert, this is howard and rajesh. guys, this is bert."
1381,Amy,it says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. were you unable to consummate the marriage?
607,Amy,cool. i think i just learned something.
1329,Amy,but the chinese team found the element.
2450,Amy,thank you.
803,Amy,when i get married i’m going to register at the ucla cadaver lab.
1608,Amy,"maybe you’ll get hit by a car and die. lol, right?"
1696,Amy,he was really angry that you suggested he move out.
3413,Amy,i was missing you again.
142,Amy,"sheldon, i am not going through menopause."
2650,Amy,who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?
1747,Amy,"you mean, like, where she’s nice to your face? okay got it. bye. hey, boyfriend."
1121,Amy,are rajesh and leonard competing for it as well?
2378,Amy,"no, it, it, it’s okay. keep going?"
1178,Amy,"i guess i know that. it’s just, part of me wants more."
721,Amy,that’d be my boyfriend. happier playing his dopey star trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
1252,Amy,"beatles, boring. eminem, scary. weird al? how old are you? neil diamond?"
57,Amy,i do. i find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.
180,Amy,we have time now. think about it.
2648,Amy,"well, i just took your side ’cause sometimes i get annoyed at how close sheldon and penny are."
1050,Amy,"oh, and, uh, check this out. i took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us."
3276,Amy,"sheldon, you’re sick, go back to bed."
2200,Amy,what are you doing here?
2214,Amy,"i know we’re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, i made cookies in the shape of male genitals."
573,Amy,"i was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. i don’t know about bernadette."
3070,Amy,i’ll call you when we get to the hotel.
2920,Amy,"if you’d give me a minute, i’ll tell you."
1721,Amy,then i have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than i am. is bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?
1760,Amy,sheldon and i got an eight-point-two out of ten.
922,Amy,if and when?
1748,Amy,"no, and neither did our waiter."
1899,Amy,after only 232 episodes.
1888,Amy,"come on, let’s talk about something other than the surgery."
470,Amy,who didn’t? your skin is like alabaster. do you even have pores?
1314,Amy,no.
1798,Amy,"oh, don’t be embarrassed. i’ll show you the divot in my spine."
645,Amy,"yeah, you’re a biologist."
3311,Amy,"oh. hello, you’re on fun with flags."
633,Amy,i’m sure it was.
25,Amy,correct. my turn.
2956,Amy,"you know, it’s one thing to be envious, but now you’re injuring yourself. it has to stop."
2410,Amy,okay.
2708,Amy,sheldon.
1780,Amy,then i think it’s a terrific idea.
2888,Amy,and i’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.
94,Amy,a colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. well don’t tell me that’s not girl talk.
2029,Amy,"that’s what i said. before i knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart."
3111,Amy,is there anything we can do?
2742,Amy,"well, we didn’t see you last night, we’re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together."
679,Amy,"oh, my goodness, how could i have not seen that? the painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool."
1176,Amy,do you have any interest now?
2810,Amy,fine.
2427,Amy,"ooh, i just heard something. might be hail, might be gunfire. either way, i’m gonna go take pictures. bye."
563,Amy,shh. that’s how you wind up in a cornfield.
2771,Amy,oh. this is so exciting.
1631,Amy,then i’ll buy you a new entertainment centre.
3266,Amy,"revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition."
1230,Amy,"no, sheldon, don’t."
938,Amy,"just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change i’ve been meaning to take to the bank."
1733,Amy,"i do, i see it."
3183,Amy,why don’t you just tell him you don’t want to go?
1841,Amy,we all have a past.
409,Amy,"i was. now i’m thinking about what i read. you all right, leonard? you seem very uncomfortable."
588,Amy,ooh!
1447,Amy,what’s the show?
2113,Amy,"ooh, you just chose champions. it’s like we’re re-enacting the ancient german practice of trial by combat."
807,Amy,what does that mean?
129,Amy,"oh, that sounds like fun."
194,Amy,"fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. in the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage."
2753,Amy,and you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party.
3436,Amy,"hello, sheldon."
597,Amy,how do you know? are you a doctor?
243,Amy,"outstanding. and if we fail, we can always stop at cvs and pick you out a nice toothbrush. i call mine gerard."
2023,Amy,"she did that to me, too."
2559,Amy,"sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? you know that one’s out-of-date."
2092,Amy,"well, that is an important part."
498,Amy,you don’t get it. look at this brain.
2883,Amy,"this is ridiculous. penny, do you remember when i taught you ubbi dubbi?"
3152,Amy,"sheldon, that was so sweet of you."
251,Amy,because i do that now.
3169,Amy,what’s that little dot in the middle?
255,Amy,"now, now. evolutionary biologist robin dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups."
2691,Amy,come in.
460,Amy,he’s great.
3451,Amy,"darn it. there’s something in my eye, and i need to sort these coins by size. can you help?"
1568,Amy,"just say something normal like, i saw your profile. looks like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee sometime.”"
1750,Amy,"sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?"
2192,Amy,like you’re doing right now?
3382,Amy,we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.
277,Amy,i wonder what changed her mind.
1398,Amy,"i know you don’t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. that translates to funding."
2841,Amy,what’s going on here?
781,Amy,"once in high school, but i dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face."
825,Amy,"oh, i don’t know. looks like something used by tinkerbell’s gynecologist."
3300,Amy,get your food.
1833,Amy,you have a nice night.
3268,Amy,"thanks, babe. number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas."
298,Amy,a little. the real danger is him biting my face off while i’m sleeping.
1408,Amy,"a little early for alcohol, isn’t it?"
2437,Amy,hi. nice to meet you.
1113,Amy,hey.
785,Amy,"well, when you see him, tell him i say thank you."
2306,Amy,no. pinch me.
3366,Amy,of course. i get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…
2360,Amy,"that’s nothing sheldon hasn’t done before. dave’s just a big fan of his work. besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up again."
3467,Amy,my first love broke my heart for the first time.
2355,Amy,"yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. i took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was leonard nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend."
135,Amy,zack.
1938,Amy,there’s a craft and folk art museum on wilshire.
1581,Amy,should you really be sitting in sheldon’s spot?
2531,Amy,"maybe later i’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit."
2770,Amy,seriously?
3411,Amy,nice try.
2647,Amy,"oh, i honestly couldn’t care less."
2683,Amy,"you know, just when i think we’re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. i mean, if he didn’t want to go shopping with me, why didn’t he just say so?"
1985,Amy,what?
2739,Amy,i wish there were some way i could make it better.
1221,Amy,what happened?
734,Amy,what about the science center?
1248,Amy,"well, off the top of my head, i’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. plus, when we first met, penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you."
1033,Amy,children’s toy.
1542,Amy,"well, thankfully, i won’t have to see it, ’cause i won’t be your girlfriend anymore. amy farrah fowler. why, yes, i would like to take a survey."
3441,Amy,"oh, it’s probably sheldon. hi, sheldon. everybody’s here, say hi."
2693,Amy,"well, he’s come a long way. or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way."
2408,Amy,"i’m just, um, really nervous."
2775,Amy,"well, if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it."
2630,Amy,"no, it’s only if you’ve done it."
2161,Amy,what are you doing?
905,Amy,can i speak to you for a second?
263,Amy,it’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. are you familiar with meme theory?
2132,Amy,more juvenile than this?
1081,Amy,"i didn’t mean now. hello? yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. well, i’d like a normal boyfriend. deal with it."
3415,Amy,hi.
196,Amy,"sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race."
870,Amy,"so, listen, sheldon, i was thinking, since this is gonna be our first halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, i thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume."
2662,Amy,"oh, we’re the first ones here."
3076,Amy,i’ll miss you more. 
2146,Amy,who says this is the only one i hid?
1377,Amy,are you honestly comparing thanksgiving dinner at wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
3028,Amy,"well, that was quite a day."
2911,Amy,"are you suggesting al-ghazali was aristotelian? ‘cause if anything, he was anti-aristotelian."
2886,Amy,penny was just covering for me. my place has been ready for two weeks.
1119,Amy,okay.
203,Amy,i came as quickly as i could.
2676,Amy,"so, claire, we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you."
2765,Amy,"oh, my, this is a big step."
2813,Amy,"i told you, you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives."
2611,Amy,"well, i feel closer to you now."
1013,Amy,"no, no, no, it doesn’t. thor is a god. the hammer is his, only he can use it. it’s like sheldon and his toothbrush. or his thin, beckoning lips."
182,Amy,"of course, we’re best friends."
2342,Amy,"thank you. okay, your turn. hmm. seal, hagfish, spongebob squarepants."
293,Amy,i have yoo-hoo.
3310,Amy,"so welcome to tonight’s episode, "
1466,Amy,"oh, you forgot your quartz."
1771,Amy,"i’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones."
1576,Amy,i’m meeting her for coffee.
1712,Amy,you were worried about that?
606,Amy,"hang on, dr. c. what’s vexillology?"
1305,Amy,"oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. sorry, uh, better?"
628,Amy,"no, i just need those beakers washed. hippity-hop, quick like a bunny."
1633,Amy,"so, heads it’s ps4, tails it’s xbox one."
2754,Amy,"well, it’s not exactly like it. we’re all extremely smart."
1701,Amy,right.
722,Amy,what?
1359,Amy,that’s sweet.
2688,Amy,three minutes. and he used a kitchen timer. i felt like a soft-boiled egg.
2689,Amy,"bernadette, i’ll give you five dollars to slam the door."
1338,Amy,shh.
1281,Amy,do you feel better?
422,Amy,"not without cutting his head open, no. how about making my eyes like cleopatra?"
629,Amy,"sheldon, you’ve never worked in a lab like this before. you have no experience in the field of biology."
1523,Amy,why? because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?
3057,Amy,have you? how am i feeling right now?
3177,Amy,"well, that’s sweet. i bet you’ll have fun."
2834,Amy,"it’s a nice enough spot. you know, if i’m going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing…"
741,Amy,right. and that was…
2094,Amy,it’s not your fault.
2333,Amy,just one. are you doing okay?
3037,Amy,"well, uh, howard and bernadette had their baby."
1705,Amy,are you okay?
1895,Amy,don’t be like that. you two need to talk this out.
672,Amy,"i’m so humiliated. i sat there the whole time that we were watching grease, thinking you liked the painting."
112,Amy,"interesting. how will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?"
3073,Amy,bye.
2672,Amy,hello.
3304,Amy,"i’m sorry, bert, but aren’t you worried she’s only with you for your money?"
1266,Amy,"i enjoyed it. when you told me i was going to be losing my virginity, i didn’t think you meant showing me raiders of the lost ark for the first time."
1084,Amy,that better be tootsie rolls you’re throwing at me!
492,Amy,"i’m just saying, second base is right there."
780,Amy,how long does this stay on?
2816,Amy,"okay. well, for starters, there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder."
1199,Amy,"oh, brain lesions are fascinating. unless they’re yours, then they’re a drag."
3178,Amy,"no, thanks. i already live in a place all the nerds come to."
708,Amy,"you know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after i’ve already told everybody i’ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. go home and play your game."
238,Amy,what’s that like?
62,Amy,i understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. have you tried a bar or tavern?
47,Amy,"absolutely not. my colleagues and i are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. that means it’s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours."
2407,Amy,hi.
39,Amy,"like everybody else’s. subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. thank you for asking. why is she not taking our order?"
3335,Amy,"okay, fine, let’s say you never win a nobel prize. let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man. wouldn’t that be a life well-lived?"
1190,Amy,"so, after i started dating sheldon, i met leonard, and then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me."
3234,Amy,"yes, i’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place."
49,Amy,we appear to have reached an impasse.
2971,Amy,"well, how about we start a little smaller? like moving the furniture around."
443,Amy,good night. 
1929,Amy,they’re your meemaw’s christmas cookies. i called and got the recipe.
1189,Amy,"a, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. and b, more importantly, i was the outsider to this group, and i know how frightening that can be. but you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like i was family."
2337,Amy,sure. what is it?
3055,Amy,that’s right. 
3197,Amy,so you’re not going to comic-con?
1491,Amy,"last week, you spent that on a little dress. "
2463,Amy,really?
28,Amy,we postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
278,Amy,as good an explanation as any.
82,Amy,"leonard, you’re right. we should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all."
2620,Amy,yes.
2172,Amy,oh. what are you doing here?
2550,Amy,are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us?
2955,Amy,what happened?
3418,Amy,may i offer an observation?
487,Amy,"sheldon, i’m going to ask you something, and i’d like you to keep an open mind."
2533,Amy,are you all right?
3318,Amy,how did you get from croissants to a unicycle?
546,Amy,yes.
1935,Amy,"oh, my favourite, george lucas can talk all the way through star wars, i say one word and i’m banished to the kitchen."
14,Amy,"no, thank you."
1040,Amy,me. aren’t i your perfect roommate?
3140,Amy,the food here’s supposed to be great. don’t fill up on chips.
2024,Amy,i just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.
1910,Amy,"take that, glass ceiling."
650,Amy,no.
2994,Amy,just don’t smoke.
2520,Amy,"okay, great, i mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. i was just, where’d he go?"
3362,Amy,"are, are you sure?"
1001,Amy,when did howard learn to sew?
1149,Amy,yep. your turn.
150,Amy,and?
1845,Amy,hi.
2496,Amy,so do i.
204,Amy,"to comfort you, of course. sheldon told me about leonard dating rajesh’s sister. so i high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart."
1965,Amy,"no, hold on. all canines instinctively know how to swim. why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities?"
3123,Amy,"renaissance choir’s looking pretty good right now, huh?"
2884,Amy,ubexcubellent. duboes shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing?
3345,Amy,"no, i’m waiting till he’s in a good mood."
2861,Amy,"as you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band. "
1599,Amy,it actually was kind of fun.
1619,Amy,please pass the butter!
644,Amy,no. but your thumb does.
387,Amy,"for general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?"
1519,Amy,"uh, i think we’re gonna need a minute."
3218,Amy,"come on, sheldon. maybe we should just eat at our place."
2478,Amy,rajesh?
3074,Amy,bye.
2935,Amy,"wow. i, i can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up."
1695,Amy,"he was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone."
2204,Amy,"you mean the night that i went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?"
712,Amy,"oh, that’s good."
189,Amy,not even when i do this? 
1483,Amy,"no, bert, come on. i’d love to go to the mineral show with you."
2087,Amy,no.
2105,Amy,i don’t hear it.
2118,Amy,that’s not nice.
2718,Amy,it was a lot hotter than it sounds.
2439,Amy,"that’s great. and look at you, sitting in sheldon’s spot. you know, i don’t even get to sit there."
306,Amy,"yes, dirty. dirty, dirty, dirty. which brings me to our next order of business. "
847,Amy,"uh, gift? uh, present!"
1611,Amy,"fine, sheldon. you have my undivided attention."
1011,Amy,so stupid.
2385,Amy,thanks for taking me out.
3251,Amy,wow. look at that.
739,Amy,"no, it’s not. i’ll explain it to you later."
1625,Amy,"oh, crap."
2476,Amy,"since we’re live, you’ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions."
3157,Amy,were you aware of this?
1380,Amy,"sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. you can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave."
567,Amy,"there’s habitat for humanity, building houses for the poor."
703,Amy,good morning.
210,Amy,"hi, bestie."
1490,Amy,thank you.
3321,Amy,"all right, well, have fun."
952,Amy,"sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour."
119,Amy,hoo.
1502,Amy,i told you it was penny.
252,Amy,"four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?"
802,Amy,that’s from sheldon. he told me he had it engraved.
2411,Amy,"me, too."
1154,Amy,let’s box it up.
1435,Amy,"oh. wow. i had no idea. he is so into me. wait, wait, where’d i go?"
2278,Amy,thank you.
806,Amy,you’re not answering the question. do you love him?
2547,Amy,"ooh, let’s find out."
1131,Amy,let’s go over our emotional responses one last time.
1208,Amy,"no, tell me, i want to know what you meant by that."
1812,Amy,"sheldon, i’m really impressed you’re willing to try this."
491,Amy,we cuddle. final offer.
755,Amy,yes.
2121,Amy,really should have thought this through.
2482,Amy,"oh. uh, we-we have another caller. hi. you’re on fun with flags."
2055,Amy,"but that’s not your fault. like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. you’ll stay with me when he’s at comic-con or away for work."
2275,Amy,because it’s new and weird and i’m just trying to figure it all out. and i knew if i told you guys i had been out with a few people that you’d get way too excited about it.
586,Amy,"which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling."
3151,Amy,fine with me.
2332,Amy,i mixed them.
2174,Amy,"sheldon, when i’m ready to talk, i’ll let you know."
3224,Amy,what’s wrong?
260,Amy,yes. he looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. although it’s not much of a contest. the other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
2117,Amy,"uh, it, it’s been a long time. i don’t know. i’m probably pretty rusty."
972,Amy,are you saying you want to spank me?
1731,Amy,no penny?
570,Amy,"you were right, a whole new load."
1867,Amy,you said it.
85,Amy,i’m a girl.
3108,Amy,"no, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings. and i’m proud of you, for reasons i’m sure have something to do with my father. and if you don’t like that machine, get rid of it. because i love you exactly the way you are."
2352,Amy,okay. sure.
774,Amy,who is it?
1637,Amy,"let’s get you some food. you, you’ll feel better after you eat."
1376,Amy,we do. and i expect you to be on your best behaviour.
723,Amy,what’s the difference?
1443,Amy,and? how did it make you feel?
1513,Amy,we’re going to have valentine’s day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.
754,Amy,"we’ll see. let’s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?"
844,Amy,"and there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. if this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. if you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now."
261,Amy,by all means.
510,Amy,"oh, my gosh. no one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. well, that’s not true. once, but then they all died."
2145,Amy,would it alarm you to know that i hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
789,Amy,i can’t believe i bleached my moustache for this.
834,Amy,it’s her i have to worry about.
2011,Amy,"sheldon, it’s me."
3391,Amy,"actually, i want to hear about you. how are things at home?"
599,Amy,guess it’ll just be sheldon and me going on a double date with howard and bernadette.
2372,Amy,"no, i, i think it’s neat. oh."
1180,Amy,okay.
3231,Amy,that’s great. how so?
642,Amy,"you’re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. hope your hands are steady. it’s the width of a single hair. but this is just biology, so i’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you."
2487,Amy,now?
683,Amy,"oh, screw her. she’s just lucky we let her hang out with us."
634,Amy,"yeah, good for you. now, start counting."
1976,Amy,"sheldon, this has to stop. you need to get some sleep and take care of yourself."
1777,Amy,of course.
2484,Amy,"well, i, i wouldn’t say right away."
2606,Amy,"that’s me, your emotional outhouse. you know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, i’m, i’m here for you."
909,Amy,"i’m mad at you, sheldon."
3199,Amy,by yourself?
1754,Amy,"after a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin."
815,Amy,she’s not sure how she feels.
695,Amy,that was kind of uncalled for.
1474,Amy,i’m sorry. who are you dating?
2791,Amy,okay. what if we do this?
993,Amy,"you think that’s bad? in college, i passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on."
294,Amy,make yourself comfortable.
927,Amy,"wait, i’m leaving my car here?"
1819,Amy,i’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.
2597,Amy,"so, why do you feel you need to save these things?"
2402,Amy,of course.
2554,Amy,you should see the valentine’s day card he gave me.
2365,Amy,thank you.
3247,Amy,"number two, disagreements can happen politely. there’s no need to call an idea stupid."
2286,Amy,to that new italian place on walnut.
2280,Amy,okay. but i’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.
1732,Amy,because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?
1964,Amy,"if i were going to hawaii, i’d spend all my time at the keck observatory. did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the hubble?"
2655,Amy,how?
3002,Amy,"well, shall we start over?"
572,Amy,"what is it, the fuzz?"
2511,Amy,how could you do that?
1099,Amy,"oh, i want to be cinderella, too."
123,Amy,"i’m suddenly feeling flushed. my heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. in addition, i keep involuntarily saying hoo."
336,Amy,i don’t understand. is this a way to break in new shoes?
1578,Amy,"no. we just ended up having a lot in common. we went to harvard, we like chaucer, we’re both hardcore into quilting."
2772,Amy,you’ve been roommates with sheldon forever. do you have any advice?
735,Amy,rain check.
796,Amy,you know what? i’m done with this.
1270,Amy,"well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey."
1810,Amy,no. they forgot i was there. but it really opened up my pores.
3351,Amy,"oh, the more details, the more sorry. well, maybe this’ll cheer you up. i made your favorite oatmeal, plain."
873,Amy,"sheldon, when i said couples costume, i meant like romeo and juliet or cinderella and prince charming, not two robots from some silly movie i don’t even like."
3208,Amy,talk to me. tell me what’s going on.
2858,Amy,cheers.
1567,Amy,"no. you’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy."
107,Amy,bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. the miller’s tale by chaucer is the dirtiest story i know. it would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.
1195,Amy,"me, too."
3381,Amy,i’ll love you no matter what.
2584,Amy,all right.
2443,Amy,"well, i, i’m, i’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me."
3131,Amy,it’s bigger than mine.
2730,Amy,"oh, but you did it so well. that’s amazing, it’s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies."
1761,Amy,i’m gonna let you count this as two dates. they’re a lot of work.
1811,Amy,save you first; come back for raj only if there’s time.
2869,Amy,"thanks, but you don’t have to."
1559,Amy,"before i met sheldon, i was ready to give up, too. once, i even dropped in on my obgyn just to get some human contact."
3156,Amy,you-you know about that?
2624,Amy,"on the other hand, safety first."
2795,Amy,"sheldon, i’ve made more than enough accommodations for you. we’re both grown adults, we’ve been far more intimate than this. if you don’t want to snuggle, fine, but we’re not building a pillow wall."
2040,Amy,"keep it down, we’re working here."
1511,Amy,i got you your own room. 
3458,Amy,"huh. well, this is weird."
2820,Amy,why is nothing easy with him?
1997,Amy,in the 1800s that was considered flirting.
7,Amy,"noted. now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table."
766,Amy,"well, it was going to be mine."
1838,Amy,"well, i hope you get it."
647,Amy,do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
1612,Amy,no way.
1277,Amy,you’re trying to get back at me for what i said about raiders of the lost ark.
1123,Amy,"or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family."
2732,Amy,i can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here.
2056,Amy,what are you talking about?
3426,Amy,"i kissed a girl and i liked it, i hope my boyfriend don’t mind it."
2331,Amy,let’s see. i have been on six dates with three different people. it was either for coffee or dinner. one i met at a bookstore and two i met online. i haven’t slept with anyone. the aquarium is 40 minutes away. and there’s a baggie of cheerios for you in the glove compartment.
1304,Amy,"what do you want, sheldon?"
2794,Amy,"sheldon? i know we took coitus off the table, but i was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling."
3407,Amy,"that’s what you said to me when i started dating him. and then five years later, bingo bango, something happened."
2990,Amy,sheldon.
2903,Amy,what is happening?
2446,Amy,"well, now i know."
3446,Amy,"hey, girlfriend. can i get a what what?"
2953,Amy,sounds like the night we had coitus.
1265,Amy,it was good.
788,Amy,you found a loophole?
264,Amy,meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
3368,Amy,"hey, you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors."
496,Amy,it’s okay. i’m glad this happened. i can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-
2700,Amy,"my pleasure, mrs. cooper."
2696,Amy,so there’s no maid of honour?
1846,Amy,what’s with the clothes?
742,Amy,i don’t think that was helpful.
449,Amy,"no. i’ll let him have tonight. then in the morning, i’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. i mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does."
1173,Amy,i’ll tell you what they think. they think our relationship is a joke.
2346,Amy,i guess sometimes i’m silly.
1461,Amy,"hello, mr. rat brain. not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?"
3184,Amy,he is an indoor cat.
1749,Amy,it’s hard to argue with that. and i know because i saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.
2028,Amy,forget it.
29,Amy,"in a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. the low-lying city of copenhagen is flooded. thousands die. devastated, the danes never invent their namesake pastry. how does one miss that?"
2012,Amy,what are you talking about?
2910,Amy,"although, in aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink."
2803,Amy,"sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea."
1998,Amy,"okay, that’s enough."
303,Amy,excuse me. have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
1028,Amy,the strap is part of the hammer.
3452,Amy,"penny? i really want to eat this banana, but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box."
1698,Amy,"you’re probably right. so, what are you guys doing?"
1776,Amy,shh. amy’s here now.
1602,Amy,i’m sure it’s lovable.
1885,Amy,"just go to work, he’ll be fine."
1150,Amy,exactly. how does that make you feel?
1074,Amy,"oh, sheldon."
2461,Amy,"look, i know you think i’m not right for sheldon, but trust me, i’m his best shot. you have no idea how much i put up with."
3046,Amy,i don’t think that’s what she’s saying.
416,Amy,"if it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother."
190,Amy,"well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy."
3066,Amy,but now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you? i get that.
3440,Amy,"hello, sheldon. is everything okay?"
174,Amy,are you in the lanthanoid series?
1958,Amy,my mother said that’s how good girls do it.
3166,Amy,what is this?
175,Amy,i missed you.
1052,Amy,"‘cause we out dropping science, son."
1740,Amy,"you better watch that attitude, buddy. you’re dating the popular girl now."
1344,Amy,"yes, and i’ve heard so much about you. hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. i can’t believe i dress like a celebrity."
2582,Amy,"sheldon, just tell me."
2059,Amy,no one told you to poke the turtle’s face.
445,Amy,wine is one of the reasons i’m in this fix. that and this dang pelvis.
619,Amy,i saved you a dumpling.
1386,Amy,you need any help?
1877,Amy,don’t worry about that. i’m happy to take you to work.
2899,Amy,sorry.
2503,Amy,are you hungry? how about that sushi place you love?
861,Amy,"one, two, three, eat."
3047,Amy,that’s exactly what she was saying.
2973,Amy,"well, i’m sure she misses this one. i mean, it’s the greatest gift i’ve ever given anybody."
2517,Amy,hi. how are you doing?
3280,Amy,"sheldon, are you okay?"
2789,Amy,"okay, i’ll take that side."
724,Amy,how do i get him to treat me better?
320,Amy,"no, it’s not. it’s a strategic manoeuvre. leonard’s new girlfriend is testing bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. that bitch is crafty."
1765,Amy,"i’ll tell you what. if we stay, i’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead."
184,Amy,are we talking about women wanting penises? because i’d like to weigh in.
1781,Amy,of course i do.
2082,Amy,it only refers to dr. cooper and his team. did you even talk about him?
612,Amy,"hang on, dr. cooper. what’s vexillology?"
2469,Amy,"people who are fans of an internet show about flags? trust me, they’re around."
2050,Amy,"for halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone."
1259,Amy,today!
2513,Amy,then why are we drinking?
1779,Amy,"interesting. can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?"
497,Amy,"don’t. i’ll be okay. you’re not the first girls i thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. it’s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in norway all over again."
101,Amy,"i’m not sure i grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. next on wikipedia’s list of slumber party activities, truth or dare."
639,Amy,"sheldon, i’ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven’t done one of them right."
560,Amy,"come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?"
2386,Amy,i heard that new mexican place on green street is good.
1739,Amy,but i’m just…
208,Amy,"well, granted, penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. but priya is highly educated, she’s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows."
2299,Amy,really? you-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?
2796,Amy,"oh, oh, oh."
2170,Amy,hold on. you’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?
2223,Amy,"my mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies."
2985,Amy,"so, no one’s gonna tell me? okay."
1950,Amy,are you crazy? you know he’s a flight risk.
3021,Amy,sheldon and i are living together.
3372,Amy,thank you.
2576,Amy,or you could just look into my eyes.
2046,Amy,"after a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward."
1859,Amy,why not?
1480,Amy,"that’s very nice of you, but i do have a boyfriend."
1588,Amy,"according to wikipedia, sherlock holmes came first."
621,Amy,"this is really happening. i’m gonna be a maid of honour. i’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, i will have my special day."
1414,Amy,"yeah, kinda."
1152,Amy,"come on, you can do this."
3075,Amy,i’ll miss you.
1246,Amy,no.
535,Amy,or we play travel twister.
1047,Amy,yes.
3341,Amy,"thanks, but the thing is i’ll be gone for a few months and i don’t know how sheldon’s gonna feel about that."
2156,Amy,"he’s right. roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years."
27,Amy,isn’t it obvious?
635,Amy,how’s it going?
1434,Amy,i don’t understand.
1769,Amy,we have led different lives.
1294,Amy,"no, we’re not good here. i am working on this project."
2499,Amy,what?
768,Amy,"it’s all i have left. you’re going to take that from me, too?"
1276,Amy,i love little house. it made me want to live on a farm so much i tried to milk my cat. that tangy bowl of cheerios was not worth the stitches.
1139,Amy,sheldon!
1962,Amy,because you’re happy they’re elevated.
598,Amy,with a dead man.
1200,Amy,and to the sick and dying who make it possible.
1971,Amy,"sheldon, i want you to take that cap off."
3133,Amy,i’m sorry. i can’t help it.
1851,Amy,"okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. stop bragging."
1858,Amy,"sheldon, can i come in?"
2546,Amy,you don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.
1528,Amy,i’m being rude? you’ve been rude to me this entire evening.
1196,Amy,does he ever shut up?
3270,Amy,"well, sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project."
2960,Amy,what’s up?
2544,Amy,"she’s pregnant, she’s not a bloodhound."
1807,Amy,okay.
1479,Amy,weren’t you?
2623,Amy,"sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car."
3210,Amy,and there is the love of which i speak.
2212,Amy,"i don’t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now."
32,Amy,"very good, leonard. but next time, don’t tell us where you’re hiding."
2928,Amy,"good, you know, in case the exit isn’t clearly marked."
3260,Amy,"hey, i wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex."
3230,Amy,"yup, we’re killin’ it."
557,Amy,i should’ve gotten a lawyer.
1825,Amy,what happened?
2124,Amy,"no, sheldon."
1951,Amy,"sheldon, that really is an excellent basket."
1562,Amy,oh. let me guess. there’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
1210,Amy,"we could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and i remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo."
2628,Amy,what’s the game?
2947,Amy,no. 
2587,Amy,i’m driving the car. i need to know.
2014,Amy,i just saw you.
1055,Amy,"well, what is it, then? i did everything just the way you like it."
1372,Amy,i’m gonna go with sad. so what’s the story with you and this dvd?
2467,Amy,"so if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?"
2436,Amy,"i feel so, so bad."
1980,Amy,they have it.
2256,Amy,"i don’t know. i guess i assumed that i would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast."
2380,Amy,"i love you, too."
131,Amy,ears and genitalia.
495,Amy,"that’s not necessary, it’s like sesame street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone."
1251,Amy,great. sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. he doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member. 
3450,Amy,"boy, i just can’t seem to get these scissors back together. can you do it?"
383,Amy,would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
1596,Amy,i’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.
730,Amy,armin… damn it.
314,Amy,"until i met you and bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. now they have a delightful social aspect."
282,Amy,why did you bring him? he’s harshing my buzz.
522,Amy,"come on, bestie, you’re up."
1368,Amy,you want to say sorry.
594,Amy,come on.
432,Amy,you have any evidence to support that statement?
1668,Amy,"no, it combines two of sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button."
423,Amy,perhaps you’re right. my cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
3373,Amy,does this mean you’re okay with me going?
1061,Amy,"i concur, but you changed the subject. what are we doing for valentine’s day?"
1590,Amy,that is so sweet.
3207,Amy,"but you are, aren’t you?"
1341,Amy,"oh, sheldon."
236,Amy,"yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh."
3353,Amy,"oh. that’s sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own."
3443,Amy,"how’s it going, sheldon?"
1973,Amy,"sheldon, stop it, i’m not kidding. take the cap off, and put the notebook away."
1652,Amy,"i know, it’s weird, right?"
1742,Amy,"oh. oh, i hear you. try and get that nag off your back, right? i mean, you’re not a bicycle, why’s she riding you like that?"
205,Amy,"you don’t have to be strong for me. now let’s talk about priya, that man-stealing bitch."
1110,Amy,"sheldon, that’s not a real thing."
3344,Amy,"yeah, um, raj is moving out."
311,Amy,okay. don’t really know where we go from here.
884,Amy,"wow, my boyfriend is friends with stephen hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn’t smell like tar. everything really is coming up amy."
2395,Amy,"hi, sheldon."
2474,Amy,and dr. amy farrah fowler present…
472,Amy,"sheldon, sometimes you forget, i’m a lady. and with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body."
1032,Amy,how’s that?
1080,Amy,"because she’s your friend, and she did a nice job. i’m sure she’d like to hear it."
1912,Amy,i pressed it.
2575,Amy,i thought you might like it.
1648,Amy,but none of that means we don’t love you.
3060,Amy,do you need help?
537,Amy,i think a boy likes me.
357,Amy,"now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so."
1168,Amy,here we go. fifteen?
3017,Amy,good. then you’re used to this.
1549,Amy,you’re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.
1007,Amy,"all right, well, who’s the best superhero?"
3011,Amy,i got a gryffindor robe for you.
666,Amy,why?
1352,Amy,sheldon.
1614,Amy,included?
137,Amy,why do you keep saying zack?
591,Amy,"you just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?"
617,Amy,und ich bin eine pretzel!
3018,Amy,you have got to be kidding me.
714,Amy,"not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. i mean, think about it. i’m dating sheldon cooper."
35,Amy,"actually, i’m not. in order to avoid surprises, i wear them all the time."
2491,Amy,"hello, kripke."
1097,Amy,"ooh, that sounds like fun."
468,Amy,"yes and no. all those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. so it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. check it out, still in the bags. the gowns, not the bridesmaids."
1053,Amy,beep.
1788,Amy,what?
3142,Amy,because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.
44,Amy,"it’s very impressive, for theoretical work."
436,Amy,howard?
241,Amy,it appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.
2566,Amy,that lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.
3313,Amy,to denial.
793,Amy,have i ever told you you’re like a sexy praying mantis? 
466,Amy,"girlfriends, i have the answer to our dress problems."
483,Amy,it doesn’t matter. nothing matters.
965,Amy,i’ll tell him tomorrow. mama needs a bath.
1143,Amy,"okay. well, what i think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure."
2621,Amy,yay.
2679,Amy,what are you doing here? you’re not sheldon.
2941,Amy,hello.
1737,Amy,"so, after drinks with bernadette, i get home, and penny calls to complain about her. and then while i’m talking to penny, i get a text from bernadette."
1388,Amy,did you guys know penny married zack three years ago?
1030,Amy,"sheldon, what’s going on?"
2051,Amy,that’s what i said.
942,Amy,i was parked in sheldon’s spot.
1570,Amy,"well, what would i say to her?"
2235,Amy,i’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. i don’t know what you’re talking about.
878,Amy,"i’m raggedy ann, and he’s raggedy c-3po."
2020,Amy,"well, except barnabas, but he was on adderall."
3158,Amy,because i’m mad at you.
299,Amy,yeah. he’s kind of an ass.
2942,Amy,i don’t think so.
1773,Amy,"what if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? i mean, next thing you know, you’re in her home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine."
262,Amy,i don’t understand. the original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
580,Amy,hey.
1299,Amy,gentlemen.
771,Amy,"all right, that’s enough. today is not about you two. today is about howard and bernadette and me."
1658,Amy,"i mean, not in a romantic way. it’s just, she really has some sort of connection with him."
177,Amy,do you subscribe to the freudian theory of penis envy?
576,Amy,sounds like you hit the ground running. i have a bit of good news myself. my most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of neuron.
593,Amy,"too bad. if he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines."
103,Amy,all right. to what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?
71,Amy,sheldon?
1547,Amy,which is stronger than ever.
2317,Amy,see you then.
3173,Amy,please?
2806,Amy,"what would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? i mean, you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. and you don’t even get that joke, ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables."
179,Amy,"not for sex, for convenience. you can’t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance."
550,Amy,what’s that?
140,Amy,where would i have picked up an alien parasite?
324,Amy,"you are, with hair that smells like strawberries. and we’re going to use that to our advantage."
1062,Amy,hello.
2811,Amy,good.
890,Amy,understood.
2061,Amy,"sheldon, i know the odds of you even going to mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever."
3359,Amy,"yeah, that’s the one."
541,Amy,"i’m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, i can put myself in any repellent situation i want."
912,Amy,what?
610,Amy,i’m surrendering to fun.
341,Amy,"she thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream, no matter what."
1506,Amy,"we’ll come back to that one. this brings us to the final item in our annual state of the relationship summit. item 29, valentine’s day."
2604,Amy,"so, no one else knows about this?"
1232,Amy,"hello, sailor."
3472,Amy,"my goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient."
3257,Amy,"you know, you’re exhausting. i knew working together was a bad idea."
329,Amy,"oh, my metatarsal are barking."
3340,Amy,"i was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at princeton."
935,Amy,you?
3461,Amy,"it’s not the best best western i’ve been to, but i’d say it’s the third best best western i’ve been to."
288,Amy,"oh, blah, blah, blah. give me some sugar, bestie ."
477,Amy,they’re out shopping right now?
2201,Amy,and you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so i would open the door.
518,Amy,"what are you, a nun? come on, bestie, let’s see some skin."
2,Amy,"that’s enough. sheldon, sheldon, give it!"
125,Amy,"it’s too thin if i were making a foot-long brain sandwich at quiznos. for examination under a two-photon microscope, it’s fine."
906,Amy,"i don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. you need to ask him to leave."
371,Amy,nope. sounds gop rop e a top.
267,Amy,we need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.
2646,Amy,"you know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. dips in testosterone can cause irritability."
2783,Amy,"well, that’s it. for the next five weeks, we are officially living together."
2493,Amy,"no, hold on, rajesh. you know, you’re not being very sympathetic. you know first hand that breakups are hard."
2581,Amy,okay. how ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this?
799,Amy,"sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and i are done."
2074,Amy,are you asking me to go to mars with you?
2189,Amy,yeah.
1651,Amy,and you don’t feel guilty about it?
3030,Amy,hi.
2748,Amy,i don’t know where everyone is.
2114,Amy,"if you still have that bra, i’ll give you a nickel for it."
1045,Amy,here you go. i picked up the chinese food just the way leonard used to.
113,Amy,"well, i’m not sure how this is scored, but i believe we may have won."
230,Amy,"parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully."
173,Amy,are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
2964,Amy,"ever since i met penny, i’ve been envious of her looks."
1355,Amy,i’m making a bracelet.
1375,Amy,"sheldon, that was diabolical."
2093,Amy,but leonard’s idea was good.
1227,Amy,is it penny?
856,Amy,"oh, there he is, i got him."
2507,Amy,"yeah, tell us."
412,Amy,"i’m glad to hear you say that, because i’m having a wonderful time. hmm, i said the same thing to my gynaecologist."
804,Amy,‘cause i’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
1253,Amy,i love neil diamond.
3100,Amy,stop enjoying their fight.
2756,Amy,i think we’re good.
2912,Amy,it’s just a tiny skin sample. you saw me do it to myself.
2929,Amy,"sheldon, that’s enough."
2208,Amy,anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.
565,Amy,perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. which word’s tripping you up? assuage or altruism?
1450,Amy,just think of the first 245 as the prequel.
715,Amy,"he’s handsome, he’s lanky, he’s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality."
2159,Amy,that’s what you’re thinking about?
249,Amy,"believe me, it’s there, we all have it. hit me with some more booze, and i’ll show you."
2375,Amy,that’s sheldon.
2216,Amy,i had extra dough.
2202,Amy,just give me the box.
2017,Amy,"so what are we talking, like, ten bucks?"
1791,Amy,"so, um, now that penny’s not coming…"
3214,Amy,"well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, ’cause that was a lousy anniversary present."
2598,Amy,okay. i get it. i get it.
259,Amy,fascinating work. i recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
515,Amy,"maid of honour amy farrah fowler’s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one."
149,Amy,is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?
2376,Amy,"sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time."
2078,Amy,"i guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple."
1361,Amy,"so, what tools did you bring?"
2381,Amy,get back here.
1044,Amy,"oh, there you are. when do i get a key to our apartment?"
3330,Amy,i’m sorry i called you a quitter.
2613,Amy,"and yet, i’m not."
418,Amy,"well, i had a delightful evening, leonard. we should do this again sometime."
1454,Amy,i guess.
2344,Amy,"isn’t that gross? i mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute."
1952,Amy,very nice.
3350,Amy,"oh, i’m sorry to hear that."
1644,Amy,how does that happen?
381,Amy,oh… you are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
349,Amy,what astronaut story?
2567,Amy,"look, i’m, i’m sorry for your loss, but i think i have something that might make you feel better. i got you a new computer."
2414,Amy,"okay, well, i should unpack."
3233,Amy,i’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it.
506,Amy,"i know how you feel. i got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too."
933,Amy,"don’t play dumb with me, sister. you tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars."
2724,Amy,what’s wrong?
1979,Amy,whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?
1726,Amy,"no, i just, i feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back, it’s me and it’s right in front of my face."
1020,Amy,no! it can’t decide. it’s a hammer.
998,Amy,"it’s your assistant alex, isn’t it?"
2898,Amy,yes.
1433,Amy,i wish i could believe you. i also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in rice sheldon.
3090,Amy,and also a little sad.
1629,Amy,"no, what are you doing? no, no, pick that back up. you know it’s good. you did the research."
821,Amy,you slept with him?
2961,Amy,yep.
1677,Amy,"hey, guys."
569,Amy,"i don’t think mother teresa… oh, that is adorable."
1624,Amy,"well, that’s got to be a good feeling."
3061,Amy,like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the internet.
54,Amy,touche.
1069,Amy,"i’m your girlfriend. that’s my job. and i know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return."
511,Amy,"yes. yes. oh, my gosh, i, i have so much to do. there’s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. what should we do for the bachelorette party? oh, i know, we’ll go to a native american sweat lodge, we’ll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on bernadette’s naked body. so that’s happening."
2622,Amy,have you ever been off the grid before?
316,Amy,"you okay in there, bestie?"
2564,Amy,i got here as quickly as i could.
1753,Amy,i then suggested a pub.
1736,Amy,i don’t know. the important thing is i am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.
1262,Amy,there’s a neil diamond concert next month.
2591,Amy,do you want me to hold that computer?
2766,Amy,what do you think?
1713,Amy,"sheldon, it’s okay with me that you’re not perfect."
614,Amy,"for someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, doctor who sure does have a thing for modern-day london."
954,Amy,of course i do. there have been many studies proving its validity.
2782,Amy,"come on, sheldon."
838,Amy,isn’t it obvious? i’m spreading my scent to mark my territory.
763,Amy,"i love his eidetic memory, it’s so sexy. sheldon, what are the ingredients in pringles?"
526,Amy,"sheldon, what do you expect us to do?"
375,Amy,"no, i can’t let you do that."
304,Amy,what do you think ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
699,Amy,she’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up.
2967,Amy,how can you feel bad if stephen hawking says you’re brilliant?
655,Amy,what’s huge is what you’ve done for me.
1728,Amy,"i’m saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank’s problem?"
1510,Amy,"one step ahead of you, bernadette and wolowitz are going with us."
2664,Amy,"oh, i do. it was three years ago."
2807,Amy,"oh, you heard me. your experimental bona fides are laughable."
2187,Amy,it’s because you’re not giving me any space to think.
3091,Amy,what do you think?
1060,Amy,you know what would show them? i should move in here with you.
2215,Amy,thank you. the veins are gummy worms.
555,Amy,that’s my boyfriend. it’s open!
1193,Amy,"excuse me, but i’m a neurobiologist. i think i’m a little more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in your girlfriend’s brain!"
1473,Amy,i guess it hasn’t come up.
2428,Amy,"i said what’s new, but sure."
1157,Amy,"i’m proud of you, sheldon. "
822,Amy,"well, if that’s all it takes, it’s a good thing you don’t have a dog."
1018,Amy,"we are. we’re just, uh, giving you a head start."
1587,Amy,"oh, ugh."
106,Amy,"and absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and nicholas is scalded in the towte. this tale is doon, and god save al the rowte.”"
2850,Amy,how old was it
709,Amy,my boyfriend’s a jerk.
2370,Amy,my fault. i brought him up.
962,Amy,i got better two days ago. it’s just been so nice having sheldon take care of me.
2773,Amy,i don’t know. i didn’t count.
889,Amy,how’d it go with leonard?
2288,Amy,"well, i’m having a good time, too. if you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?"
1539,Amy,"oh, i’ve already moved on. besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me."
2447,Amy,"i have a relationship and a full-time career, too."
914,Amy,"cut. yikes, this guy is worse than wil wheaton."
3110,Amy,"well, he mentioned it in his mother’s eulogy, so why not?"
840,Amy,"look at you, putting on a brave face."
1036,Amy,no.
2842,Amy,"well, that’s so nice. who’s coming?"
1146,Amy,i’ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.
2871,Amy,"no. and on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?"
2292,Amy,no. he’s a theoretical physicist at caltech.
2909,Amy,"you know, some people believe that buridan was plagiarizing aristotle."
729,Amy,"and if you don’t start treating me better, i’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named armin."
343,Amy,got it. is it going to be in 3-d?
201,Amy,"or worse, it could go to the liberal arts."
1507,Amy,"before you get upset, i believe i’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy."
3102,Amy,i think it loses its impact if we’re chatting about it.
2460,Amy,don’t speak to him like he’s a child.
3078,Amy,"sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away."
616,Amy,"her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth."
2305,Amy,what are you guys doing here?
247,Amy,"this may be the alcohol talking, but i believe there is. are you familiar with the recent study of tanzanian chimpanzees by nishida and hosaka out of kyoto university?"
485,Amy,yes.
3118,Amy,no. i really give up.
1693,Amy,it tastes the same.
3202,Amy,"no, sheldon. we are not getting a life-size spider-man statue."
56,Amy,sixty-five.
2021,Amy,how can i make this up to you?
1584,Amy,i’m leaving.
3259,Amy,"i had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but i didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive."
3405,Amy,why didn’t you tell me?
2758,Amy,"and there was water everywhere, it was such a mess."
2870,Amy,"good stuff. so, uh, what about dinner?"
2353,Amy,"hi, dave. uh, it’s amy."
2025,Amy,and then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes.
3064,Amy,"that was fun, thank you."
583,Amy,we both know that’s your koala face.
1213,Amy,mm-hmm. it was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.
944,Amy,how do you know?
3034,Amy,maybe there won’t be one.
2881,Amy,"oh, uh, they’re still working on it."
1857,Amy,where are you going?
1111,Amy,this is really fun.
2176,Amy,we’re not back together.
2800,Amy,i don’t know if i can make it through five weeks living with him.
1085,Amy,"sadly, i’m no longer associated with that project."
339,Amy,i wish. a clique requires friends. i didn’t have any.
1393,Amy,zack’s here!
725,Amy,"no, he loves that."
2722,Amy,i will not have you be disrespectful to me.
3404,Amy,i gave you one job. keep an eye on him. how hard is that?
1723,Amy,"well, i think she just wants you to do well, and she’s worried that you won’t ’cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress."
2923,Amy,no reason we can’t start right now.
542,Amy,anything else?
787,Amy,"on our date? sheldon, that’s not okay."
524,Amy,"– sorry, sorry. "
2639,Amy,i brought my famous spinach dip.
198,Amy,"technically, faisal is my fiance. but i do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in riyadh for the winter."
116,Amy,penny?
521,Amy,"not penny beautiful, but beautiful."
2586,Amy,will you please tell me where we’re going?
2453,Amy,"the minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. i don’t need this."
40,Amy,really? i assumed an establishment called the cheesecake factory would function more efficiently.
2308,Amy,"um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but i just, i don’t think this is working out."
533,Amy,a comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can’t be used as a floatation device.
390,Amy,kiss me where i’ve never been kissed before.
2470,Amy,what do you mean?
674,Amy,"yes, too much. because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. i clearly like you more than you like me."
700,Amy,"no, hang on. i followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. i made a written record request 72 hours in advance. i checked the tyre pressure on the car. i even contacted the centres for disease control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to orange county. fyi, it’s none."
2951,Amy,"you know, sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning."
2527,Amy,"well, you made my last birthday so memorable, i wanted to return the favour."
1229,Amy,let me listen. sounds like leonard.
1686,Amy,they just don’t appreciate you.
3094,Amy,"okay, i’m looking at the first picture."
1295,Amy,"sheldon, you don’t have to worry about me bothering you. i’ll be in a different building. and we don’t even have to have lunch together."
507,Amy,what do you want? do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?
1051,Amy,and this is amy.
791,Amy,"sheldon, how could you do this? it’s our second anniversary."
1702,Amy,actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well.
2433,Amy,maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. it’s called empathy. it’s something you could work on.
1659,Amy,"don’t get me wrong, i’m glad they’re friends. i just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already."
932,Amy,in sheldon’s spot.
2129,Amy,"when there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. i tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but i just got attacked by bees."
1138,Amy,"you’re all wasting your time. sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom’s going to change that. seriously, is that tape? like, how are they staying up like that?"
1390,Amy,i can’t believe penny’s married to zack.
3301,Amy,go.
60,Amy,next!
1669,Amy,"okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating."
2002,Amy,"“what about the future?” asked amelia. he looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, “there is no future without you.” he pulled her in close. she began to tremble all over. she felt his warm breath…"
2228,Amy,who?
1419,Amy,it’s true. none of you would know me. you wouldn’t know bernadette. you wouldn’t be dating penny.
2573,Amy,knock it off or i’ll start making w-h sounds for words that just have a w.
192,Amy,"well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser."
1743,Amy,"okay, good luck. and call me later, you know, if you decide she’s a bitch or something. hey, girlfriend."
280,Amy,wow. is there anything on there about orthotics?
2847,Amy,"well, that’s not a surprise at all. i mean, if i knew you were good at surprises, i would have"
3416,Amy,"uh-huh. hang on.  hello. a little late, leonard. sorry."
1245,Amy,i’m sorry you got stuck with me. i bet you wanted to be with bernadette.
3023,Amy,we’ve all come a long way. there’s a lot to be proud of.
881,Amy,why wouldn’t you tell leonard?
945,Amy,"me, too. in some weird way, i kind of feel like it brought us closer."
2535,Amy,"well, don’t you think i’m the one who should go in?"
1828,Amy,i sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.
96,Amy,"oh, good, a slumber party! we’ll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!"
1275,Amy,"good night, dr. cooper."
2557,Amy,i didn’t understand your e-mail.
1844,Amy,sure.
2819,Amy,you wanna see other people? go see other people.
1420,Amy,"which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her, which couldn’t have happened without sheldon. same goes with you guys. if leonard wasn’t with penny, she never would have set you up."
737,Amy,keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage.
950,Amy,"never mind. good night, sheldon."
1115,Amy,use me as a human shield!
2685,Amy,i called him babe once. he asked me to get a drug test.
10,Amy,but the light indicates…
3241,Amy,that’s a ridiculous rule.
1185,Amy,go away! sheldon is nibbling on my  14! yes!
1764,Amy,"sheldon, what did you expect?"
2763,Amy,you’re sure that’s not an inconvenience?
2090,Amy,remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
930,Amy,"oh, looks like someone’s on team bernadette. where’s howard?"
1263,Amy,she got the way to groove me.
1919,Amy,"okay, let’s get this victorian party started. i’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play."
3445,Amy,"okay, sheldon, thanks for checking in. talk to you tomorrow? oh, okay, bye."
2982,Amy,"i don’t think you do, but all right."
1816,Amy,"sheldon, is everything okay?"
51,Amy,"good day, sheldon cooper."
883,Amy,"i can, but she’s sitting right there."
220,Amy,wise.
608,Amy,i’ll say.
615,Amy,what’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. hair too golden? laugh too musical? world too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
2715,Amy,who’s ready for a wedding?
3333,Amy,"that’s ridiculous, you’re a brilliant man. the best years of your life are still ahead of you."
1283,Amy,"sheldon, i have some exciting news to tell you."
1941,Amy,because you always pick what we do and i just go along with it.
1585,Amy,"yeah, it’s bloom."
1437,Amy,"that’s fine, she’s dead."
743,Amy,perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. do you have a cousin who you find attractive?
582,Amy,"well, i don’t want to talk to him. and i’m pretty disappointed in you, too. although we both know that won’t last."
1231,Amy,please leave me out of this.
2479,Amy,"i, i think it starts with good communication."
1663,Amy,do you want me to go to the funeral with you?
2762,Amy,really?
3456,Amy,hi.
490,Amy,"how about this? french kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base."
1556,Amy,thanks for walking me to my car.
1616,Amy,"whoa, whoa. wait a second. who’s they?"
1177,Amy,wow. talk dirty to me.
2169,Amy,not really. can you come over?
3293,Amy,could have played that on my harp.
3358,Amy,i was offered a summer research fellowship at princeton.
2534,Amy,"oh, do you need a minute?"
1029,Amy,"all right, well, how was work today? did you exchange your research with kripke?"
187,Amy,are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man i’ve ever seen in my life?
2595,Amy,you have sporting equipment?
2740,Amy,"uh, actually, i got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant."
2104,Amy,and girls.
1268,Amy,"all right. indiana jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. if he weren’t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same."
1787,Amy,what if we don’t want to vomit?
1495,Amy,there sure are a lot of little kids here.
2026,Amy,"other than the fact that i had it, that was a magical night."
2475,Amy,"consider tonight’s episode a valentine’s day gift for you, our viewers."
345,Amy,"good golly, penny, your whimsy is boundless.  what do you got for me, wildebeest?"
3295,Amy,"and don’t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. just keep trying.  oh, thank god, welcome to fun with flags."
953,Amy,"i have to say, i’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking."
2849,Amy,been 15 minutes. just sayin’.
2416,Amy,"okay, i’m glad you’re not here?"
121,Amy,interesting. and was it not satisfactory?
2568,Amy,do what?
658,Amy,do you like it?
926,Amy,freaking pigs.
22,Amy,then 128.
2565,Amy,"sheldon, this is silly."
2413,Amy,what makes a best best buy the best best buy?
1893,Amy,"sheldon, you can’t go back there."
2006,Amy,what’s this for?
265,Amy,i should think so. that’s gold.
1356,Amy,"actually, i’d kind of like to try that."
143,Amy,"i think we need to face the cold, hard truth, i was sexually aroused by penny’s friend zack."
1423,Amy,where’d you go?
2937,Amy,i’m not playing anything. we’re not making a baby today.
2435,Amy,glad i could help.
126,Amy,"very well. if you die and donate your body to science, i promise to slice your brain like canadian bacon."
2253,Amy,i don’t have much experience turning men down. it wasn’t so much fun.
1959,Amy,"sheldon, you’re a remarkable scientist. just be patient, i’m sure you’ll find the breakthrough you’ve been looking for."
402,Amy,something in the chair’s biting my tushy. it’s not important. ow!
3417,Amy,it’s not important.
1412,Amy,how come you never said she was pregnant?
414,Amy,"oh, i’m up all night. i’m like a possum. boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?"
2419,Amy,"oh. sheldon, thank you. that’s so romantic. but what about rajesh? he was okay with you choosing the name?"
1234,Amy,"well, he’s mad at you, too. he says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray."
3182,Amy,comic-con’s five days.
446,Amy,"the inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while i was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of madonna and whore."
3402,Amy,"huge fan, you say?"
2284,Amy,just a little peck on the lips.
2515,Amy,would you like to sing karaoke with us.
1842,Amy,that has to wait. this weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.
108,Amy,"you might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it."
3442,Amy,"hi, sheldon. everything okay?"
618,Amy,mit…
2054,Amy,"well, he’s barely moving. he looks half dead."
543,Amy,i’m listening.
347,Amy,"oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. what’s the problem?"
1909,Amy,action.
767,Amy,can i wear my maid of honour dress?
89,Amy,"yes, but they’re not girls. i’m a girl."
3147,Amy,that’s a real thing?
2802,Amy,"well, i didn’t, and it’s your fault."
3206,Amy,don’t listen to them. what’s weird is that penny almost got a science fact right.
859,Amy,"ready, set, wrestle.  one, two, three, pin."
286,Amy,"oh, i’m not confused at all. you’re like a sexy toddler."
2552,Amy,i hope everything’s okay.
1124,Amy,"you know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision."
2440,Amy,can i have a tissue?
3324,Amy,"oh. well, bernadette made me promise if you didn’t want it, we’d give it to a homeless clown. what happened to learning the unicycle?"
1647,Amy,"i’m sorry, i just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory."
3219,Amy,just keep walking.
3269,Amy,did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?
225,Amy,"sheldon, look at me. i think it’s time to face the fact that leonard is the nucleus of your social group. where he goes, the group goes."
694,Amy,he showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. i foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.
810,Amy,just watch the movie.
2336,Amy,"well, it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby."
630,Amy,soap spots. wash ’em again.
1793,Amy,"maybe after this, you’ll be in the mood for some manilow."
404,Amy,i can’t imagine that would disturb me. carry on.
1685,Amy,"well, with you not working, that makes financial sense."
488,Amy,"at this moment, i find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact."
2343,Amy,but you can pal around with a hagfish?
2788,Amy,great. that’s your side.
1755,Amy,"there they go, fighting again. you’d never hear her talk that way to sauvignon blanc."
1002,Amy,i don’t even understand why they go to these conventions.
3185,Amy,penny says they’re ready to go.
2702,Amy,it sure was.
1330,Amy,so you just got lucky?
1109,Amy,you have something we want.
73,Amy,in what way are you screwed? all i want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that i’m in a relationship.
2420,Amy,all of them?
1444,Amy,"this is nice, that we all get to eat together."
528,Amy,"sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. just like you did with the mailman."
13,Amy,hmm. would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.
1813,Amy,i’m going to the vending machine. do you want anything?
2925,Amy,"you know, most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years."
2052,Amy,it’s okay. you made it. we’re fine.
379,Amy,"no problem. try and keep it in your pants, okay?"
43,Amy,i’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone.
2432,Amy,"sheldon, i understand that you’re upset because you feel left out, but i don’t know why we’re even talking about this. just apologize to them."
3179,Amy,my aunt’s funeral?
1333,Amy,i’m not.
2652,Amy,who told you to stop making all those gandhi jokes about him?
2703,Amy,"oh, well, the usual gang. penny’s family is coming tomorrow."
2991,Amy,is that okay?
670,Amy,i’m just glad i didn’t go for the sculpture.
1465,Amy,this is so pretty. bert works for the geology department.
1369,Amy,you told lucy he was a pathetic mess.
454,Amy,mortal enemy?
894,Amy,cut.
736,Amy,"all right, pivoting to the big question. bernadette, on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. what do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?"
2907,Amy,of course. jean buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
1282,Amy,it’s actually steamier than it looks. sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in renaissance paintings.
1349,Amy,"maybe he found you, um, a bit much."
3121,Amy,"hey, did you hear anything back from the caltech preschool?"
1415,Amy,that’s wonderful. so you’re at the hospital?
1610,Amy,then get the other one. pass the butter.
1606,Amy,now i think you’re flirting with the line. good news?
1046,Amy,yes.
2893,Amy,good night.
2915,Amy,thank you.
1977,Amy,"your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety."
2649,Amy,who’s always comforting him when he’s upset?
2194,Amy,what baby?
900,Amy,"great. so, this time let’s try more real boy, less pinocchio. and action."
2823,Amy,that’s true.
2293,Amy,"um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. but let’s not discuss sheldon. let’s get back to you."
160,Amy,an experiment. nope. nothing. never mind.
50,Amy,seconded.
1228,Amy,"yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like."
2018,Amy,"wow, the store looks great."
651,Amy,no.
3145,Amy,"oh, we’re having date night."
166,Amy,please don’t touch my breasts.
2100,Amy,"sheldon, the view is a daytime talk show hosted by women."
2356,Amy,"well, i was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again sometime."
584,Amy,"jewellery? seriously? sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person i have ever met. do you really think another transparently manip..oh! it’s a tiara! a tiara! i have a tiara! put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me."
955,Amy,"sheldon, this isn’t helping. why don’t you just let me get some rest."
1709,Amy,"i’m mad at you. how could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call leonard for help instead of me?"
2563,Amy,get a new computer.
207,Amy,oh. then perhaps you don’t understand what’s going on. your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. arguably much more suitable than you.
3015,Amy,ooh. happy birthday to me.
1922,Amy,thank you. and it’s figs.
1665,Amy,are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?
2037,Amy,"well, we’re the ones tagging along, you pick."
2950,Amy,bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.
1766,Amy,does it matter?
3392,Amy,i miss you.
1518,Amy,i’m so glad you like it.
3248,Amy,are you listening?
1605,Amy,"no. no, it was a mistake."
411,Amy,"well, most recently my gynaecologist."
1801,Amy,why’d you tell her? it was working.
1641,Amy,"sheldon, your food’s getting cold. what are you doing?"
1582,Amy,"oh, hi."
16,Amy,that’s an amusing factoid.
505,Amy,"whee! ooh, finally someone found second base."
911,Amy,"sheldon, i’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. that’s it. end of story. good night."
2845,Amy,you never went into that haunted house.
3098,Amy,yes.
2245,Amy,you really should’ve gone on the internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.
396,Amy,aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?
120,Amy,i’m often flummoxed by current slang. does went out mean had intercourse?
1214,Amy,maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.
1432,Amy,"if that were true, i wouldn’t still be living alone. well, not exactly alone. i do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of sheldon’s t-shirts on it."
1015,Amy,maybe we missed something.
1609,Amy,"can you get the butter, please?"
2838,Amy,"you know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over."
2444,Amy,i’m curious. why do you call sheldon moon pie?
17,Amy,is this true?
69,Amy,certainly. good night.
162,Amy,that’s too bad. i was hoping you could be my plus-one at the institute of interdisciplinary studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.
350,Amy,i texted architect. that’s amusing. auto-correct must’ve changed it.
2514,Amy,"oh, no. sheldon’s drunk texting me."
1854,Amy,you went to seven proms?
335,Amy,"i heard it at the mall, when i was shopping with my girlfriends, ’cause, you know, that’s kind of my life now. have a good night. try not to ogle my caboose as i walk away."
1586,Amy,i think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.
88,Amy,i’m a girl.
302,Amy,i trained ricky how to smoke. i can train him to shoot a poison dart. no jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.
1223,Amy,i don’t think penny would cheat on leonard.
3048,Amy,"well, after that, sheldon and i got out of the house for a while."
657,Amy,i wanted to get you something you didn’t have.
2431,Amy,who else’s side could you have been on?
3462,Amy,"hi, sheldon. what’s up?"
2240,Amy,i’m sure you’ll find somebody else.
2887,Amy,everybody stop it with that.
185,Amy,"hi, bestie."
1468,Amy,"what?! no, he doesn’t."
1889,Amy,stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.
1316,Amy,"sheldon, you’re not a weirdo."
2319,Amy,hi. ready for the aquarium?
211,Amy,"so, how you holding up?"
1147,Amy,"all i’m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…"
3103,Amy,"sheldon, dinner’s ready. i made beef loaf, because i know you’re uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf. sheldon? hey, are you okay?"
428,Amy,"you’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either."
2004,Amy,how many?
2063,Amy,"and who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? you could barely survive a tiny turtle bite."
3316,Amy,is this part of your super-aging?
20,Amy,"this is very interesting. cultural perceptions are subjective. penny, to your mind, are you a slut?"
940,Amy,"i do. penny, bernadette and i are sorry."
2265,Amy,i said no.
1598,Amy,excuse me?
3125,Amy,you sure? they’re open till dos.
1216,Amy,"not my guy. i caught him staring at my rack. it’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. fyi, it’s another cardigan."
2379,Amy,"i really want that, too."
866,Amy,"that’s not always true. last night i gave sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated."
2890,Amy,are you saying you’d like to live with me?
467,Amy,"twelve years ago, my cousin irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding."
2670,Amy,are you gonna say hi to him?
2471,Amy,oh. that is so sweet.
2454,Amy,what ring?
3434,Amy,what?
2542,Amy,see what?
663,Amy,"i guess i should get going, too. good night, painting penny. good night, real penny."
413,Amy,how was your shower?
2157,Amy,do you think the moms will get along?
2252,Amy,"suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense."
3444,Amy,"how’s it going, sheldon?"
946,Amy,"hello, sheldon."
1394,Amy,"all right, mister, i think you owe howard and bernadette an apology."
1448,Amy,he’s wrong.
2505,Amy,think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
193,Amy,"all right. have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?"
1882,Amy,twenty eight.
3176,Amy,you’re actually going to comic-con?
2369,Amy,"yeah. anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, i pretty much had to take him everywhere."
1022,Amy,"okay, if you’re going to start comparing wands and hammers, i can’t even take you seriously."
2769,Amy,"sheldon, what do you think?"
3396,Amy,what are you gonna do about it?
2246,Amy,"hey, i know sheldon’s quirky, but he’s also brilliant and insightful. i think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair."
2062,Amy,i would at least mention it before filling out the application.
1694,Amy,"hi, is sheldon here?"
1543,Amy,of course i was.
1317,Amy,what’s your point?
373,Amy,"ninety-nine, one hundred. it’s like a waterfall of liquid gold. my turn."
1134,Amy,giving mrs. davis the box set of roots was?
36,Amy,shamy?
3007,Amy,no.
1664,Amy,why not?
456,Amy,a floppy disk?
1335,Amy,poor bernadette.
1600,Amy,yeah.
2089,Amy,"leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. he’s going to feel bad."
1672,Amy,"i never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that sheldon got interested in science."
2585,Amy,"well, i signed one before we slept together. why not now?"
18,Amy,"once a year. it’s a deal i made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her george foreman grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. how about you, penny? do you go on many dates?"
1862,Amy,"sheldon, this is silly. i’m not missing another prom. i’m going upstairs now. good-bye."
3245,Amy,terrific. do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?
2233,Amy,"well, it’s kind of sad that they don’t know. i mean, they love leonard."
452,Amy,"homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. you’re the whole package, aren’t you?"
1334,Amy,"sheldon, i’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. you don’t deserve any credit. all you did was misread some numbers on a table. a very easy table, too. honestly, i’m embarrassed for you."
459,Amy,it’s not for us to judge. we’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done.
1378,Amy,they’re real.
3139,Amy,oh. immature.
202,Amy,"millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies."
2007,Amy,"well, that’s fascinating. i can’t wait to read it."
501,Amy,"hey, cuddles."
400,Amy,"no, i am your friend. please don’t be mad at me."
784,Amy,"sheldon, this place is so romantic. "
2199,Amy,"sheldon, this has to stop. i know it’s hard. it’s hard for me, too. but i’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together."
331,Amy,thank you. did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
2334,Amy,good. i want you to be happy.
2373,Amy,"no, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. i’m, i’m just a little nervous."
2354,Amy,i’m fine. how are you?
2366,Amy,"when you were married, did your wife cook?"
936,Amy,"oh, yeah? well, you’re not gonna see this coming. "
1682,Amy,how many is that now?
3249,Amy,"number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat."
3258,Amy,that would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.
1789,Amy,what does that mean?
86,Amy,no need. penny and i are very close.
931,Amy,he had my car towed. it cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.
2363,Amy,"you know what? good. i tried to get back together with sheldon, he shot me down. dave likes me. maybe intimate is what i need."
3109,Amy,it’s true. pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy.
895,Amy,"sorry, sheldon, you were brilliant as always. wil, that was a little wooden."
1505,Amy,"i’m sorry, but gollum and flakey are not acceptable."
1445,Amy,hmm. can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?
841,Amy,"really? i don’t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but sheldon’s assistant was clearly courting leonard. were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. by the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out."
473,Amy,your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
355,Amy,i was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
3067,Amy,"better than ever. he asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. he’s like my boyfriend in college, except he’s real, so people can see him."
283,Amy,i need some context.
992,Amy,forget it. i don’t expect you guys to understand.
852,Amy,why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?
1966,Amy,"you’ve been working so much lately, i’m glad you didn’t forget about date night."
928,Amy,"before i park, come in the back seat. i want to show you something i had done today."
2009,Amy,"i did. you said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs."
2387,Amy,why would i get a bikini wax for my birthday?
698,Amy,"gentlemen, as much as i’m sure sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and i have other plans. we are attending my aunt flora’s 93rd birthday party."
1038,Amy,what if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?
2394,Amy,come in.
1357,Amy,"wow, penny, good job."
1326,Amy,what’s wrong?
733,Amy,"ooh, science center. redeeming. let’s go."
2005,Amy,is that really true?
1054,Amy,what? why? is it the message? i only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn’t break in.
2866,Amy,"oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone."
45,Amy,"i’m sorry, was i being too subtle? i meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what’s the word i’m looking for? hmm, cute."
636,Amy,great.
2945,Amy,"okay, i’ve had enough."
1995,Amy,"you know, there was a time when i was alone and had no friends. i’m starting to miss that."
500,Amy,"oh, look. it’s sheldon and little leonard. hi, little leonard."
835,Amy,"oh, really? look at this face  how can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?"
1699,Amy,that’s nice.
3272,Amy,why did you tell leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow?
3033,Amy,"so, while we’re at your mother’s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together."
669,Amy,why? so you can just take it down when i leave? i don’t need your pity.
1775,Amy,"i’m gonna go with penny on this one. then again, why wouldn’t i? i mean, we go way back."
1847,Amy,"i meant why are they folded? but whatever. ooh, what’s this?"
2921,Amy,"those are your eyelashes, move. well, sheldon, i see astrocytes. our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network."
1034,Amy,children’s toy.
549,Amy,how did you get into my apartment?
3167,Amy,are you really worried about revealing secrets to stephen hawking?
1348,Amy,have you ever thought about why arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?
2717,Amy,"sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. i think it’s nice they’re hitting it off."
2457,Amy,when did you get an engagement ring?
1806,Amy,"we had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that."
2905,Amy,what are you doing?
3112,Amy,"oh. all this week, the early music society of pasadena is doing a joint concert with the san gabriel renaissance choir."
2186,Amy,i said i needed time to think.
1913,Amy,"wait, she-hulk’s a lawyer?"
2889,Amy,i guess it’s okay. i’m sorry that i lied about my apartment.
2329,Amy,"so, you had some questions about me seeing other people."
2825,Amy,"he put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without amy’s hair on the soap."
1319,Amy,"sheldon, too. if i see him at work, i’m just going to ignore him."
2868,Amy,"anyway, how about dinner?"
2048,Amy,yes.
1865,Amy,i’m always hoping. but tonight i just wanted to have a nice time with you. and maybe dance with someone who has arms.
2725,Amy,"you did already know, right?"
585,Amy,"of course i do, i’m a princess, and this is my tiara!"
319,Amy,and i’ll be right by your side.
1536,Amy,"hey, you were funny on purpose, good job."
74,Amy,precisely.
2944,Amy,i thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.
1988,Amy,why? what did i do?
2495,Amy,really?
579,Amy,give me a minute. i’m gonna go wash up.
2211,Amy,i’m gonna kill him.
1521,Amy,why do i even try?
110,Amy,i don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.
289,Amy,really?
2669,Amy,"hey, penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend zack?"
3399,Amy,so you’re keeping busy? you’re not lonely?
451,Amy,"who’s shocked? i’m not. so, bernadette, how’s the wedding planning going? and i’m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. pick me! pick me!"
2824,Amy,you’re not making me feel better.
382,Amy,"denial. denial, denial. come in."
1241,Amy,"yeah, me, too."
1948,Amy,really?
2183,Amy,oh. what was her name?
1478,Amy,"listen, um, bert, before you say anything else, i, i have a boyfriend."
1566,Amy,wow.
2218,Amy,"so, penny, how’s married life?"
3012,Amy,i did. am i in trouble?
1697,Amy,i also mentioned that he and i could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.
1286,Amy,"well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. and there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats."
2562,Amy,get a new computer.
1704,Amy,"my pleasure. and i’m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. i love that,"
1440,Amy,did you miss me?
770,Amy,"look at all these people in love. it kind of gets you thinking, doesn’t it?"
37,Amy,oh. i don’t like that. don’t do that.
2643,Amy,sorry.
1106,Amy,i can’t believe he set it on fire.
1261,Amy,and i’ll tell you some lies. 
1763,Amy,it would make me so happy if you said things like that.
2196,Amy,"sheldon, i am not doing fun with flags with you."
1116,Amy,told you.
1876,Amy,okay.
3425,Amy,every word. our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.
2015,Amy,"oh, hey."
2180,Amy,maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
2615,Amy,here’s your tea.
3401,Amy,"oh. really? uh, when did you meet her?"
3356,Amy,"oh, i don’t know, i mean, let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. i mean, what will we have really accomplished? you know, a loaf of bread’s still three bucks."
392,Amy,will you listen to me play my harp now?
2150,Amy,"and you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her."
273,Amy,no. happy accident.
2075,Amy,okay. i suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.
2916,Amy,just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when i’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.
688,Amy,"but if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges."
3447,Amy,"hey, girl."
1671,Amy,did you ever watch professor proton when you were a kid?
3122,Amy,nothing says fun like being scolded.
3026,Amy,kind of hard to see the names.
2661,Amy,and now you know why i needed the massage.
2799,Amy,it’s not what you think.
309,Amy,yes. i also found a korean man’s business card tucked into my cleavage. what happened last night?
461,Amy,are you getting sick?
12,Amy,are you a homosexual?
2000,Amy,"fine. as cooper prepared to depart, tears filled amelia’s eyes. he took her hand in his and said, “i can’t stay, but i will never forget you.” he brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “please don’t go,” she whispered. but it was too late. the engine hummed to life."
1564,Amy,"great, so what do you need me for?"
2686,Amy,thank you.
1925,Amy,look at you on santa’s lap. that’s so sweet.
2405,Amy,hi.
1724,Amy,i’m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.
2633,Amy,"okay. my turn. um, never have i ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed."
970,Amy,i suppose that’s fair. what do you suggest?
872,Amy,yeah?
1674,Amy,"oh, i guess it must have been back when i was in the girl sprouts."
3187,Amy,"wait, wait, wait, what’s leonard lying about?"
3250,Amy,"whatever you want. so, shall we get to work?"
1486,Amy,"this isn’t funny. i’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if i didn’t have a boyfriend, i wouldn’t be interested in him."
871,Amy,really? i find that inconsistent with everything i know about you.
437,Amy,"there we go, last floor."
3168,Amy,"well, i do appreciate you working on this."
3323,Amy,what are you doing?
2133,Amy,"how’s it going, sheldon?"
1009,Amy,"well, there was a lot of action."
1184,Amy,keep rolling.
1990,Amy,but it’s personal.
3246,Amy,"number one, we’re on the same team, we’re not in competition."
3470,Amy,"maybe it’s sheldon, here to say he’s sorry."
270,Amy,agreed. it appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
3267,Amy,"revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face."
819,Amy,"hang on, please. hello?"
2631,Amy,i can’t believe you’ve been arrested.
983,Amy,"so, what’s the plan? are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?"
386,Amy,"best friends, besties, bffs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. go on."
2083,Amy,poor leonard.
127,Amy,"now, if you’ll excuse me, i have to take my temperature."
2459,Amy,"who said i even want to be engaged to him? and if i do, i, i don’t need your hand-me-downs."
1730,Amy,"hey, what’s going on?"
1438,Amy,just really glad you’re back.
2713,Amy,back to your phone.
398,Amy,"yes, he did. he absolutely did."
2455,Amy,you have an engagement ring?
609,Amy,sweet!
980,Amy,why not?
3361,Amy,so are you.
2984,Amy,"i think he might be right. also, who is that?"
2981,Amy,"sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. why don’t you let leonard keep a few things?"
2494,Amy,i’m just gonna push all the buttons.
1956,Amy,ready? begin. why’d you pop it?
3,Amy,"okay, sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. oops, missed one. now your wish can’t come true."
2066,Amy,please don’t.
2540,Amy,we’ve got someone who couldn’t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
705,Amy,you sure you’re okay with this?
3431,Amy,"sheldon cooper, i’ve got a bone to pick with you, and i’m about to do it in front of all your friends."
2282,Amy,do you have any heels higher than this? he’s pretty tall.
3390,Amy,pretty well. princeton has a beautiful campus.
1031,Amy,"sheldon, i wish there was something i could do to make you feel better. may i offer you a consoling hug?"
622,Amy,they’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head.
843,Amy,so it does bother you.
1853,Amy,"oh, that would be so much fun. we could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos."
2107,Amy,are you all set for your trip?
2930,Amy,i’ve never seen results like this before.
3403,Amy,that’s terrific. i’ll call you right back.
2335,Amy,you’re just upset ’cause they ran out of pilgrim hats.
967,Amy,oh?
2939,Amy,"well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn’t guarantee anything."
2320,Amy,if that makes you more comfortable.
2500,Amy,this is so exciting.
898,Amy,"it’s called fun with flags. they’re not at half-mast, nobody died. let’s try and keep it upbeat."
2545,Amy,what a nice gift for an astrophysicist.
896,Amy,"don’t worry, it wasn’t terrible. just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. and action."
919,Amy,"i guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. at some point, they’re bound to lock horns."
2968,Amy,way ahead of you.
2441,Amy,"well, this is so nice. he’s so excited to have you here and…"
486,Amy,"it’s just, i thought they liked hanging out with me, but i guess i was fooling myself."
3343,Amy,"sheldon, i’m so sorry."
2896,Amy,"sorry, you brought it up?"
2382,Amy,okay.
1735,Amy,"if she doesn’t do well, this could reflect poorly on you."
978,Amy,ooh!
1360,Amy,hello.
764,Amy,"the uterus quivers, does it not?"
1203,Amy,"you be cool. guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to penny."
2296,Amy,um about an hour and half.
1006,Amy,"who cares? just soak it in. hello, boys."
3421,Amy,"so, what do you think?"
2197,Amy,because we’re broken up.
19,Amy,remarkable. did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?
2364,Amy,why not?
3130,Amy,you make more than i do.
3453,Amy,hello.
831,Amy,"hmm, that’s weird."
3010,Amy,"one second. all right, you can open your eyes. i thought i’d let harry potter make things hotter."
2273,Amy,"no, it, it’s not like that."
1940,Amy,"ooh, the philharmonic is playing beethoven downtown."
503,Amy,"didn’t you go to high school, leonard? parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. not that the rat bastards ever invited me."
1158,Amy,"no rules? we’re not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the blue man group, are we?"
3290,Amy,sings in mandarin. *
2398,Amy,i can change it back.
1457,Amy,"sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?"
2525,Amy,i’m sorry.
2340,Amy,let’s just play.
111,Amy,"then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?"
1835,Amy,isn’t she lucky?
3161,Amy,i’m going to bed.
3097,Amy,yes. i’m looking at a picture of my grandma.
1086,Amy,"typical bureaucratic nonsense. you can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you’re unprofessional."
1067,Amy,"well, that’s what you’d love, isn’t it?"
2578,Amy,and rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.
2013,Amy,"sheldon, open the door."
1983,Amy,careful. she’ll bite your fingers off.
2895,Amy,"sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment."
307,Amy,i hope you don’t take what i’m about to do as a comment on what we just did. 
2155,Amy,"sure, his mom gets roses. when i want them, they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals."
3081,Amy,"nice to see you, too."
227,Amy,"don’t be needy, bestie. that’s probably part of what chased leonard away. what i am saying, sheldon, is that your group is leonard-centric. if it were a town, it would be leonardville. if it were an islamic nation, leonardstan. if it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we’d all be singing hooray for leonardwood."
2110,Amy,"i had a table, too, but i didn’t have any friends, so all i did was serve."
1708,Amy,have you not noticed that i’ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?
2706,Amy,sorry.
532,Amy,"sheldon, i’m disappointed. as a brilliant man, you’re entitled to a vice. i could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. but this? lame-o."
728,Amy,"i’m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour."
775,Amy,can’t come in. bad luck to see the bride.
2778,Amy,"i’ve never lived with someone, either. this is a lot for me, too."
1093,Amy,"hmm. we doing just disney or california adventure, too?"
2044,Amy,"well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees."
3043,Amy,are you going to?
740,Amy,"i’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon?"
1531,Amy,"fine, it’s true. i deserve romance, and i didn’t know how else to make it happen."
2033,Amy,what’s the first question?
991,Amy,"it’s fine. i’m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. i didn’t have my first kiss till i was 22, and the guy only did it so i’d give him back his insulin."
2625,Amy,"wow, it’s really coming down."
2827,Amy,but you did.
3303,Amy,i was wrong. you can come back in.
353,Amy,"i’ll make it simple for you. i study the brain, the organ responsible for beethoven’s fifth symphony. bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for michelob lite. is there something wrong with your neck?"
1527,Amy,why are you still here?
429,Amy,"why shouldn’t they be? they have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. in some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm."
1012,Amy,what a waste of time.
1492,Amy,"why can’t they do something sensible like sheldon and start their own comic book convention? also, who wants to throw me out that window?"
673,Amy,i was a fool from summer lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.
3449,Amy,you guys doing okay down there?
397,Amy,"no, he didn’t."
1363,Amy,"they’re gonna have sex before sheldon and i do, i know it."
3106,Amy,"well, everybody has things that they need help with. like me, i can’t see without my glasses. and right now you’re just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge."
1718,Amy,i wonder if stalin considered any other animals.
3355,Amy,"you know, what you need to do is put this air force project behind you and just dive into something new."
2645,Amy,do you guys want to watch with us?
2737,Amy,i am really regretting that i got you a happy meal.
1418,Amy,"you make jokes about sheldon, but if it weren’t for him, i don’t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now."
990,Amy,"so at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too."
1688,Amy,"you know, this might work out for the best. i mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate leonard is. like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there."
3419,Amy,amy farrah fowler.
358,Amy,you should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
2860,Amy,and i’m dr. amy farrah fowler.
3289,Amy,"weiches kätzchen, warmes kätzchen, das nie und nimmer murrt. liebes kätzchen, müdes kätzchen, schnurrt, schnurrt, schnurrt."
1455,Amy,sure.
2976,Amy,"well, it would be selfish of me to keep it."
1233,Amy,driving sheldon to work.
2401,Amy,you mean before you give it to me?
1626,Amy,you were just a little kid.
3331,Amy,what are you reading?
837,Amy,hang on. 
1311,Amy,get out.
3342,Amy,you really believe that?
2729,Amy,what?
2351,Amy,okay. i understand.
1026,Amy,"no. hulk picked up thor, thor picked up the hammer."
1911,Amy,"cut. sheldon, that was beautiful."
1552,Amy,can i borrow it when you’re done?
1179,Amy,come on. let’s go back out there.
2153,Amy,with a beautiful girl on your arm.
3454,Amy,"sheldon, i don’t think you understand how being broken up works. the only way i can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. every time i see you, it re-traumatizes me. i go through the pain all over again."
2658,Amy,"well, it sounds like a nice night. we should go."
751,Amy,"i had a feeling you’d be reluctant, which is why i’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks."
3041,Amy,i’ll take over from here.
1894,Amy,are you okay?
322,Amy,your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. you wouldn’t last a minute on the serengeti.
2262,Amy,how have you been?
158,Amy,"on the other hand, as i look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, i have decided to adopt the vulcan practice of kolinar. good-bye, zack."
195,Amy,perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.
3288,Amy,"fine. soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
1497,Amy,it was. till my hamster ate all her babies. it got less cute really fast.
1496,Amy,"well, last time i got dressed up and had tea was when i was five. just me, my teddy bear, raggedy ann and my hamster. "
1089,Amy,"well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so i recommend an unsafe environment. seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on skid row."
1279,Amy,"well, that’s not how we’re going to do it."
3369,Amy,"all right, so you know."
1904,Amy,"australia, mate."
2600,Amy,why?
3423,Amy,"what up, bestie? good news. thanks to you, i was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist."
2809,Amy,"well, for science, maybe i will."
435,Amy,"don’t worry, i’ll lead. "
1068,Amy,"well, then, that’s what we’re going to do."
2283,Amy,"well, i told you his name and that he’s tall. what more do you need?"
748,Amy,"well, dinner’s almost ready."
564,Amy,"i think your mistake is doing it over the phone. if they could look into your eyes, they’d melt."
2136,Amy,what are we doing? this is a fort. let’s sit on the floor.
2659,Amy,"well, i’m going. you couldn’t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you’re not stopping me now."
1890,Amy,who told you to keep going around?
5,Amy,"if that was slang, i’m unfamiliar with it. if it was literal, i share your aversion to soiled hosiery. in any case, i’m here because my mother and i have agreed that i will date at least once a year."
1087,Amy,"just so you know, this is not a stupid play. a streetcar named desire is an american classic."
1646,Amy,that’s what i’m saying.
948,Amy,"sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?"
989,Amy,and you liked bernadette also?
1300,Amy,and this is dr. gunderson from stockholm.
1939,Amy,i actually can’t go ice-skating. i have unnaturally brittle ankles.
3437,Amy,that’s right. they’re no good without the lighter.
1302,Amy,sheldon.
1660,Amy,really? what did you do?
79,Amy,"you wanted me to have a boyfriend, mother. well, here he is. have to sign off now. my hunger for sheldon is stirring in my loins."
596,Amy,"assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. you know, like a spear wound to the head."
3465,Amy,"hi, sheldon. what’s new?"
2963,Amy,what about me and sheldon?
1312,Amy,"image number six, woman giving birth."
2274,Amy,"okay, it’s like that."
2234,Amy,"uh, well, actually, to be honest, i haven’t told her yet."
3190,Amy,because it’s between them. 
2318,Amy,did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first thanksgiving?
2429,Amy,did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
3020,Amy,"yeah. penny, you’re the one who introduced him to bernie."
2667,Amy,"oh, thank god."
2602,Amy,"well, um, did you know i have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain i ever dissected?"
1397,Amy,"yeah, everything was delicious."
1617,Amy,you’re kidding.
1167,Amy,"nineteen. yes, this is turning out to be even better than vegas."
2226,Amy,"oh, i don’t know."
2656,Amy,that was scary.
1347,Amy,"come on, he’s a retired kids show host."
3459,Amy,"hi, sheldon. what’s up?"
1064,Amy,"hang on. as you know, i had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts."
2160,Amy,are any of them me?
1640,Amy,"yeah, it’s cute. that’s the problem. i don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick."
601,Amy,ooh!
1772,Amy,hmm-hmm.
2738,Amy,i understand how you feel.
2867,Amy,"well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?"
245,Amy,"ah, here’s the alcohol and drug peer pressure mother warned me about. i was starting to think it was never going to happen. yes, please."
1716,Amy,but you did do it. so what if it didn’t all go your way? that’s what makes it an adventure.
2843,Amy,you mean the romanian lady on the second floor?
155,Amy,"it’s not what i want to do, it’s what i have to do."
826,Amy,"i’m going to video-chat sheldon. if my new look leads to phone sex, i’m going to have to ask you to leave the room."
2801,Amy,miserable and exhausted.
1991,Amy,no.
1710,Amy,we’re in a moving car. what do you expect me to do? stick my fingers in my ears?
552,Amy,"section 5: hand-holding. hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. a: either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. b: either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a nobel prize. c: moral support during flu shots. seems a bit restrictive."
1797,Amy,"don’t amy me. we’re always talking about how hot penny is. come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those hadron colliders?"
109,Amy,"oh, that’s an excellent question. for two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other’s company."
2237,Amy,"oh, maybe later. your pig dying made me sad. and a little hungry."
1655,Amy,"a psychic? he considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo."
975,Amy,i don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.
2096,Amy,"hey, look at that pretty bird."
1898,Amy,"and he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board."
3376,Amy,that’s a risk i’m willing to take.
1907,Amy,i do.
2660,Amy,and i shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.
1880,Amy,"he probably got a new one. finish your breakfast. look, there’s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn’t have any syrup on it."
1076,Amy,"fine. just hold on. mommy’s on the phone! sorry. we’ve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. those guys were mellow."
191,Amy,"if this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it."
2079,Amy,"i’d say i’m sorry i asked, except i didn’t."
240,Amy,you should get one.
1155,Amy,i’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.
1128,Amy,it sounds like a long and tedious evening.
2368,Amy,"uh, about five years. i’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that i don’t need to be so close to, well, you know."
1439,Amy,i missed you.
2071,Amy,sure. unless something better comes along.
828,Amy,i’d like to speak to sheldon.
684,Amy,little higher on the right.
984,Amy,"geez, who’s forever 63 now?"
3274,Amy,"sheldon, this is silly. you can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this."
1239,Amy,"we’re sorry, rajesh. "
3159,Amy,"sheldon, it’s humiliating. thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life."
994,Amy,"i do that, too. sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. and i let it."
2417,Amy,"good-bye, sheldon."
1548,Amy,you don’t need to explain yourself to him.
794,Amy,you know what’s wonderful about the praying mantis? they devour their mate.
1273,Amy,that sounds lovely. why are you rubbing your hands together?
2350,Amy,"we are. but i was hoping, maybe…"
2285,Amy,"fine. um, he’s british. all right, that is a juicy one."
3463,Amy,i miss you.
829,Amy,"all right. well, tell him amy called."
233,Amy,you do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of mumbai.
3221,Amy,that’s not true.
209,Amy,"this is a portable electroencephalogram. i’m doing research on emotions and brain activity. so when you start crying, i can see which region of the brain is activated. then i’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. cool, huh?"
417,Amy,"dear amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. love, mom."
1930,Amy,"merry christmas, sheldon."
132,Amy,"i was sitting in a restaurant with penny and bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. penny’s friend zack stopped by and said hello and i said hoo."
1638,Amy,"what-what do you want, like, thai food? a burger?"
2084,Amy,he might not be.
1887,Amy,"he wore me down. and i was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today."
346,Amy,"calm down. everything’s going to be okay.  we may have to kill her. bernadette, i’m putting you on speakerphone. where are you now?"
1727,Amy,"i understand. you know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends."
279,Amy,"yes, not important. just stopped by to let you know i’m getting orthotics. also, i’m carrying sheldon’s baby. mum’s the word."
1635,Amy,could have given it back to me. that was a choice.
665,Amy,thank you. wait. where’d the painting go?
3124,Amy,"hey, there’s another dance club nearby. i mean, i don’t know how you feel about latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they’re open."
893,Amy,i know. it’s finally working.
2038,Amy,oh.
2707,Amy,hi.
1767,Amy,"so, howard, is stuart still living with your mom?"
80,Amy,"thank you, sheldon, that went very well."
1212,Amy,your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.
403,Amy,"no, i have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele."
915,Amy,"a little sensitive, but not bad. does it always take that long?"
1114,Amy,"me, too."
3027,Amy,they all look the same to me.
1634,Amy,what is it?
519,Amy,you think they don’t have mirrors in there? i know how i look.
2711,Amy,what took you guys so long?
1066,Amy,"by doing none of it. no dinner, no romance, no gifts. we stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved star war trek things."
338,Amy,bernadette is with priya and leonard. message received. commence operation “priya wouldn’t wanna be-ya.”
632,Amy,"all right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. i need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes."
1004,Amy,no.
1197,Amy,"because i looked in the bed, and there are no bugs."
2924,Amy,"sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. i mean, it’s remarkable, but it’s still limited in what it can do."
2502,Amy,"hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this."
2880,Amy,food’s here.
34,Amy,i must take responsibility. i had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.
2745,Amy,"hi, bert. this is my friend, penny."
68,Amy,i’d like you to meet my mother.
3271,Amy,"well, he reconfirmed with me this morning."
1654,Amy,is she still mad?
2822,Amy,i guess i should have known what i was getting myself into.
718,Amy,i don’t think i want to play a game.
3072,Amy,"uh-huh. bye, sheldon."
2374,Amy,"you know, i’m just being silly. i, i don’t know what i’m waiting for."
2348,Amy,"i did. um, listen, i really enjoyed spending this morning with you."
3265,Amy,"no, you bonehead."
2957,Amy,"you know, sheldon, instead of fixating on what bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. you’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head."
170,Amy,"yes! he had you in the other car, but i got you upgraded."
2115,Amy,"rajesh eight, penny four."
897,Amy,cut.
1308,Amy,"you embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. image number five, kitten in a teacup."
384,Amy,how about the theme song to the classic television show diff’rent strokes? now the world don’t move to the beat…
1954,Amy,it also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
824,Amy,"oh, yeah. i’m a man-eater now."
943,Amy,i’ll drive. you can see where the tow truck scratched my car.
2134,Amy,can i come in?
1346,Amy,is it really worth getting upset about?
2577,Amy,"well, you know, as long as you’re happy."
1151,Amy,and that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.
97,Amy,"well, that’s disappointing. i’ve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party."
3205,Amy,"well, sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs. he even took a picture with pluto at disneyland."
1140,Amy,"well, you’ll always be an academic success, but i seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends."
3339,Amy,"well, good for you. i actually have a little news myself."
1784,Amy,but they play barry manilow.
661,Amy,"oh, what a great movie."
285,Amy,you smell like baby powder.
1462,Amy,"hey, what brings you guys here?"
2130,Amy,"and at the same time, not."
1943,Amy,you guys comfy? this might take a while.
3254,Amy,"well, don’t give up. maybe we can fix it."
3317,Amy,"well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. maybe you need to challenge your motor skills."
641,Amy,"okay, smart guy. i’m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. have at it."
334,Amy,"so, are you off to dinner with priya, howard and bernadette?"
2690,Amy,"oh, was it, uh, dr. jenofski? i just saw his ted talk."
433,Amy,really? are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? i am.
1778,Amy,"i’m feeling a little backed into a corner, sheldon."
2095,Amy,not your fault.
1339,Amy,me? what did i do?
3032,Amy,"i rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest."
2846,Amy,"well, thank you, sheldon. this is a fun surprise."
2675,Amy,how do you know that?
1839,Amy,i can’t take these.
995,Amy,"it is, isn’t it?"
2946,Amy,it was like being hit on by rat pack pee-wee herman.
2422,Amy,are you feeling any better?
337,Amy,good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.
2541,Amy,"so, have you been having any morning sickness?"
2506,Amy,"oh, and i just found a new travel cup for sheldon. it only lets out three at a time. so, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?"
2790,Amy,rising rapidly.
1707,Amy,fine. whisper it.
3059,Amy,delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?
464,Amy,"sheldon, we’re all animals. and granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you’re just like everybody else."
3008,Amy,it’s not about trains.
2571,Amy,yes.
2651,Amy,okay. and did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?
186,Amy,"leonard, can i ask you a question?"
2704,Amy,"you’ve met her, right?"
1499,Amy,"on the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. not gonna lie, it felt good."
167,Amy,all right. i just want to establish boundaries.
691,Amy,what about supercuts?
1827,Amy,"sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. so, look, i, i wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, i have a little confession. i’m the reason it was pulled."
478,Amy,just the two of them?
447,Amy,"no, but it’s only a matter of time. how could i have not seen this coming? now i’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart."
206,Amy,"in situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. rawr."
3225,Amy,is that bothering you?
2149,Amy,i can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.
3085,Amy,it’s in our agreement. i have to laugh.
3196,Amy,the place looks great. did you guys get a maid?
188,Amy,because we’re going 120 miles per hour.
1804,Amy,can you believe this nerd?
1426,Amy,"it’s hard to say, my life would be so different."
2135,Amy,amazing.
26,Amy,tuned bayonets.
2477,Amy,"no, i just blink a lot, it’s not morse code for rescue me. oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. hello, and welcome to fun with flags. what’s your question?"
3283,Amy,"i can’t find it, either. how can he not remember a day?"
3469,Amy,i really had to go home for this?
2972,Amy,"look, we can’t just throw away penny’s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back."
1165,Amy,you guys enjoy your evening. i’m gonna go before i ruin anybody else’s weekend.
2310,Amy,there you go.
1957,Amy,"look, i know you don’t like it, but that’s the point of the experiment. i need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. and you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana."
1689,Amy,you hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.
697,Amy,there’s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?
2490,Amy,"…spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. well, that was quick. hi. you’re on fun with flags."
425,Amy,"i never went to my prom. my mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs."
2290,Amy,"no. i mean, to be completely honest, i’ve, i’ve only been in one long-term relationship."
1421,Amy,listen to me. that is not the way they usually look.
868,Amy,he takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.
1720,Amy,just give me a minute. i’m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. i just need to turn it off.
1872,Amy,"how about this, he’s a poor man’s sheldon cooper."
2731,Amy,"i mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so i can see what lights up."
370,Amy,"we’ll make popcorn, stay up all night and i’ll teach you my secret language, op."
2521,Amy,sheldon?
1681,Amy,good for you.
1871,Amy,"it’s not you. now think, there’s a car named after him."
2077,Amy,"think about it. if we had a family there, our kids would be martians."
587,Amy,ooh!
154,Amy,there’s zack.
3433,Amy,"you were right. i had nothing to worry about. that skank’s your problem, not mine."
3346,Amy,"i don’t know, maybe i shouldn’t go."
1058,Amy,"yeah. hey, ames, nothing. i was all set to move in with sheldon, and now i hear i can’t ’cause you don’t want to live with leonard."
662,Amy,my mother didn’t allow me to watch it. she was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.
2979,Amy,so do you.
1786,Amy,great.
1010,Amy,"and the story moved along at a brisk pace. it was, overall, what’s the word i’m looking for?"
3188,Amy,really? because she doesn’t actually want to go. she’s just doing it to make him happy.
961,Amy,"okay, okay, here’s the deal. i don’t need your medicine. i’m not sick."
676,Amy,"if you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. the painting set me back three grand."
540,Amy,"sheldon, what are you doing here?"
1546,Amy,which you also figured out by yourself.
2137,Amy,"i’d say, knox over ticonderoga, ’cause it’s got the gold."
3160,Amy,that’s why they’re doing it.
3115,Amy,wow. he finally used it. what’d you do?
1575,Amy,"look, i’ll see if i can change her mind tomorrow night."
951,Amy,"thank you, sheldon."
2276,Amy,it’s going fine. it’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.
2383,Amy,obi-what?
2530,Amy,"well, i’m, i’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. have to say, you, you do look good in that suit."
1336,Amy,"sheldon, get over here."
2266,Amy,i didn’t know you were interested in dating.
627,Amy,"oh, i’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers."
3136,Amy,i can get us there in two.
3035,Amy,"well, she likes me. you know, there’s a chance she might be okay with it."
221,Amy,"hi, bestie."
3262,Amy,i suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.
52,Amy,"your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. as a neurobiologist, i was curious."
1174,Amy,"sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?"
269,Amy,"sheldon and i engaged in sexual intercourse. in other news, i’m thinking of starting an herb garden. mum’s the word. gotta go."
1351,Amy,doesn’t matter.
816,Amy,"regardless, don’t say anything to leonard."
2821,Amy,i prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.
1745,Amy,"oh. well, good luck getting her to do that. she’s probably off getting another manicure. you remember when she did that? you remember?"
2637,Amy,never have i ever put salt on my food without trying it first.
1202,Amy,"oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. thank you, thank you, thank you so much."
1963,Amy,that would be so romantic for you and leonard.
2529,Amy,"well, i think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated."
1722,Amy,how come?
2270,Amy,"okay, i’m starting to feel guilty. aren’t we being a little mean?"
2975,Amy,i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i give it to her again.
3302,Amy,and don’t you slam that door.
2421,Amy,"okay, i think i know what to say now."
2456,Amy,"penny, did you know about this?"
1493,Amy,oh. you mean like a museum?
2908,Amy,"well, i wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant."
218,Amy,"so, you feeling better?"
2128,Amy,being left out is a terrible feeling. no one understands that better than i do.
1533,Amy,that was nice.
2039,Amy,"so, how do we start?"
747,Amy,"seven o’clock, right on time."
2680,Amy,hold on. he paid you to get out of spending time with me?
923,Amy,that’s an impressive accomplishment. he’s now an inspiration to millions of americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.
3201,Amy,"he can, but it’s still not changing my mind."
3296,Amy,and what does that have to do with flags?
685,Amy,little more. no. that’s got it.
2863,Amy,"so, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. such as the flag of st. kitts and nevis."
3448,Amy,you guys doing okay down there?
2424,Amy,"ooh. gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky."
2654,Amy,sheldon.
330,Amy,"yeah, yeah. i’m just breaking in some new shoes."
3336,Amy,so many warnings.
2067,Amy,why do you even want to do this?
1517,Amy,"what do you think, sheldon?"
720,Amy,"spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. at a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting."
1830,Amy,"well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so amy saves the day."
1583,Amy,i don’t know.
2588,Amy,so where are we going?
675,Amy,i bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. there’s a number.
833,Amy,you’re right. i don’t have to worry about sheldon.
2193,Amy,what do you want?
1525,Amy,"okay. i need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now."
391,Amy,never mind. i’ll talk to penny.
1430,Amy,"come on, sheldon, you should go."
2041,Amy,we used the coordinates to locate the cities.
880,Amy,"not to mention, your acting career is going south like sherman. read about it in your book."
3163,Amy,i’m not sleeping on the couch because you don’t know what’s private and what’s not.
690,Amy,"i’m a cowboy, on a steel horse i ride. i’m wanted… i’m wanted… wanted, dead or alive. sheldon, you’re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night."
1515,Amy,"well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic."
2590,Amy,how long have you had it?
2403,Amy,"sheldon, i know your present is for us to be intimate tonight."
3071,Amy,i will bring them home so you can show me how godzilla takes a shower. 
3282,Amy,maybe it’s wherever your pants are.
1509,Amy,"come on, sheldon. why not?"
1374,Amy,"i think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?"
2709,Amy,play with your phone.
2509,Amy,"oh, that sounds juicy."
2498,Amy,"interesting, and when would you use the singular?"
2126,Amy,"well, it applies to you, too."
1257,Amy,they’re coming to america. 
3277,Amy,"it’s okay, now i don’t need butter."
1379,Amy,"no traffic, we’re sailing."
3320,Amy,have you tried letting go of the rope?
801,Amy,i’ll take it.
2391,Amy,you shut your damn mouth. you actually heard him say this?
761,Amy,"hello, leonard."
2640,Amy,what’s going on with him?
2932,Amy,set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
959,Amy,that was great. rub my chest again.  
1340,Amy,sorry.
257,Amy,bernadette is thinking about breaking up with howard.
217,Amy,"now, let’s get these electrodes attached and see what’s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours."
1188,Amy,it should be me.
1160,Amy,thank you. vegas!
2987,Amy,"sheldon. okay, you can have this back in the morning."
2710,Amy,do you realize what’s happening here?
2076,Amy,"you know, we could also be the first people to procreate on mars."
2839,Amy,you know what i meant.
2958,Amy,anybody else want to try? i’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
536,Amy,"excuse me. i’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. and i’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. what do you say, bestie? we can do shirts and skins. i’m shirts. called it."
1186,Amy,"hello, rajesh."
117,Amy,don’t worry. i’ll avoid the nether yea.
1656,Amy,because she has sex with you.
1554,Amy,i think we’re gonna go.
2175,Amy,sure.
3113,Amy,good luck. people have been saying that for 600 years.
1532,Amy,sheldon.
777,Amy,"well, i’m ending it. bernadette, i want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. i also want you to know, that i will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out."
3063,Amy,sheldon.
1400,Amy,no.
1105,Amy,his quirks just make you love him more. someone please agree with me.
1023,Amy,"you can’t pick something up in outer space. in space, there is no up."
1254,Amy,"yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. it’s a real game and i’m winning it."
2036,Amy,did he say anything about the funeral?
517,Amy,so no. and action.
2875,Amy,"well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…"
860,Amy,"on the count of three. one, two…"
925,Amy,this is so exciting. i’m feeling all tingly. although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.
624,Amy,"you know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. in fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father. for example, you’re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. i could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose.  you would fetch a unicorn."
1387,Amy,"uh, sure."
1303,Amy,"test subject d7, aka betsy, fear response study. image number one, frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. no visible reaction. image number two, sousaphone. still no reaction. okay. let’s kick things up a notch. image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. okay, now we’re talking."
3308,Amy,relax. we’re the same blood type. he knew he could harvest an organ.
1824,Amy,"so, how was work today?"
3383,Amy,i will.
157,Amy,"excuse me? zack? i am amy farrah fowler. we met the other night. i have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. until i met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. and yet here i stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs."
504,Amy,"oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?"
917,Amy,sure.
1792,Amy,okay.
2589,Amy,why do you have a storage unit?
1343,Amy,i’ve never seen him this happy before.
2418,Amy,"uh, please tell me what to say next."
1,Amy,"that’s quite an impressive layout, isn’t it?"
3194,Amy,because you don’t want her to go to comic-con.
1829,Amy,"i simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress."
2755,Amy,"thank you so much, bert. this was great."
1802,Amy,we’re having the best time.
1530,Amy,it’s valentine’s day. we’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.
393,Amy,i do appreciate a bargain. this entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.
1908,Amy,"wow, that flag is a lifesaver."
3370,Amy,hey. you going somewhere?
300,Amy,of course. what’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
1690,Amy,see? maybe you’ll love living alone.
1003,Amy,"it’s probably because they were bullied growing up. in a world where you can’t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment."
1667,Amy,arthur passing away was harder on sheldon than he’s ready to admit. really hoping this will cheer him up.
55,Amy,i’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
531,Amy,"i’m sorry, sheldon."
760,Amy,just like your mommy used to make.
2605,Amy,thank you for trusting me.
2035,Amy,sounds good.
958,Amy,"oh, i’m counting on it."
1615,Amy,why would they still be using ddr3? are they nuts?
643,Amy,"oh, are we nervous, dr. cooper?"
1288,Amy,yes.
2616,Amy,"you know, if you really want to be in nature, why don’t we rent a cabin?"
1684,Amy,"so, what are the living arrangements gonna be?"
374,Amy,"oh, i could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids."
1557,Amy,why can’t raj find a girl? the mystery continues.
377,Amy,a guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? i wish i could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.
317,Amy,"the reason i ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine"
410,Amy,should i go? i’ve been told sometimes i overstay my welcome.
2913,Amy,a two.
2010,Amy,"sheldon, we’re all scientists. i helped out a fellow colleague. you’re being petty."
2423,Amy,"why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, i’ll explain to you why you’re wrong."
2750,Amy,no.
1855,Amy,"sheldon, you look so handsome."
2901,Amy,can it be more of an internal struggle?
2248,Amy,have you thought about advertising directly to females?
1715,Amy,but you still accomplished something.
98,Amy,"well, there was the time i had my tonsils out, and i shared a room with a little vietnamese girl. she didn’t make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun."
3009,Amy,stop talking about trains.
333,Amy,"please, leonard, don’t leer, you have a girlfriend."
525,Amy,sorry.
2561,Amy,"the video is failing, and the sound is cutting out."
3263,Amy,"how dare you speak that way about my grammy and hey, wait a second. wait. delta t could equal alpha sub-zero."
1162,Amy,"‘cause last time i saw him, i threw new ones and it got me nothing."
223,Amy,"penny, i’m sorry you got dragged into this. i know you’re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin."
63,Amy,"that’s not true of all bars. juice bars, for example."
1692,Amy,"sheldon, it was just a thought."
2682,Amy,can you understand why i might be annoyed right now?
592,Amy,maybe he’s dying. that would be so romantic.
907,Amy,fine. then maybe i should go.
1112,Amy,absolutely.
3203,Amy,"for the last time, no hulk, no batman, no life-size statues."
749,Amy,"tempting choices, but i have something special planned for tonight."
2267,Amy,"oh. okay. anyway, um, it’s nice to see you. you look good."
1901,Amy,that was a good one.
2792,Amy,great.
2191,Amy,i just hope i did the right thing.
76,Amy,i trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
1863,Amy,you did?
1328,Amy,that americans can’t handle the metric system?
1017,Amy,good idea. i’ll help you.
3406,Amy,should i worry?
1946,Amy,"yeah, but it’s okay."
876,Amy,"no. there are certain things that say to the world, i have a boyfriend, and he’s not made up. matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. pick one."
769,Amy,i know.
266,Amy,do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
161,Amy,"penny, a moment? do you have plans this weekend?"
778,Amy,"this is so exciting. soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend."
2434,Amy,great. now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person.
2140,Amy,"come on, i’ll help you take this down."
1953,Amy,"33 seconds. okay, that’ll be our baseline."
3119,Amy,can i pee now?
554,Amy,"bernadette, left foot yellow."
3052,Amy,she was gonna find out eventually.
3004,Amy,"okay, that makes sense. i mean, the mood’s a little different now. we, we don’t have to rush."
1738,Amy,"because it’s taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. i love them both, but i’m in the centre now, and i love that even more."
2239,Amy,"you saw that, huh? hi, mom. how are you doing? oh, good. how’s work? that’s nice. i’m fine. hey, listen, i’ve been meaning to ask, how come aunt doe and aunt florence never got along?"
441,Amy,"and again, you’re welcome."
1298,Amy,i didn’t ask for your permission.
1406,Amy,"thank you, rajesh."
874,Amy,"i make compromises for you all the time. just this once, can’t we find something that we’re both happy with?"
399,Amy,it is?
2261,Amy,"uh, bernadette, you’re my ride."
631,Amy,"sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. if it’s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it."
3375,Amy,i wasn’t thinking that.
372,Amy,"no, you’re not. you’re gonna pop a cop kop a bop a gop."
1170,Amy,i don’t like this.
2065,Amy,no. forget it.
64,Amy,that was rude.
623,Amy,"parental pressure can be daunting. i remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. last year, i finally gave in and let her do it."
1856,Amy,what’s that?
1942,Amy,what do you say? sounds kind of perfect.
2247,Amy,"well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. i mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog."
1422,Amy,"and with leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean."
439,Amy,you’re welcome.
3056,Amy,"not your whole life. i mean, science, you got that. organizing your sock drawer, you’re the king. but understanding how other people are feeling, that’s a weak spot for you."
2592,Amy,"i’m sorry. what, what am i looking at?"
1758,Amy,of course. can i have a bite of your burger?
3297,Amy,"ooh, ooh. all right. we have our next caller."
3427,Amy,i swear! can i tell my doctor? i’m probably gonna need shots!
918,Amy,"for hours. fortunately, i couldn’t understand most of it ’cause sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask."
342,Amy,how do you want to handle it?
2152,Amy,i think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with penny.
90,Amy,what’s the dress code?
3281,Amy,"it’s okay, i’m sure we’ll find it."
1574,Amy,"i told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. she thought it made you seem too shy and passive."
3377,Amy,what if we don’t fold our clothes at all?
2829,Amy,me.
1428,Amy,"happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there’s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. "
887,Amy,"oh, you could turn his act into extract , and it would be for double points."
875,Amy,you know salt makes me retain water and my cousin william was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. how about raggedy ann and andy? i loved them growing up.
2249,Amy,you can say it.
1306,Amy,determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.
1225,Amy,poor leonard.
3014,Amy,"sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?"
1129,Amy,"oh. well, in that case, perhaps i should come along."
1065,Amy,"and i appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, i decided i was being selfish. so, i cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate valentine’s day."
2209,Amy,"come on, you know leonard’s not like that."
3309,Amy,and i’m dr. amy farrah fowler.
1215,Amy,i think i would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.
530,Amy,"if you’re keeping him, i’ve got a cage you can borrow. one of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. it was both tragic and hysterical."
701,Amy,you use it to get your way.
3273,Amy,but you said you were working with me.
790,Amy,go home.
1042,Amy,tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea.
2536,Amy,"well, i’ve, you know, seen him without pants on."
620,Amy,"i’m sorry, sheldon, i’m busy. i’m right in the middle of my addiction study. i’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to o’doul’s."
2837,Amy,i would love to.
3239,Amy,"you know, we’ve never collaborated professionally before. are you worried it might affect our relationship?"
527,Amy,"yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing."
58,Amy,i would. i love cats. they’re the epitome of indifference.
3164,Amy,"that’s different. she’s a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches."
2311,Amy,sure. heh.
947,Amy,i think i’m too sick to go to the funeral.
2572,Amy,yes.
792,Amy,thank you.
41,Amy,"you’re right, he’s a festival of humdrum chitchat."
3084,Amy,it’s there on purpose. it’s refreshing.
719,Amy,like that?
1891,Amy,"penny has a good point. this is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. whatever you’re thinking, just keep it to yourself."
1220,Amy,lucky guess.
3132,Amy,"i’m not even engaged once. i don’t even know if sheldon thinks about marriage. i’m not getting any younger. honestly, i kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of…"
2948,Amy,"for god’s sake, you’re ridiculous."
2111,Amy,"and if i had a friend, they might have told me that."
3243,Amy,can i see that?
2761,Amy,they didn’t say.
3174,Amy,what? why didn’t you say anything?
689,Amy,sure.
2462,Amy,really? you know what it’s like to have date night ruined because google changed their font?
2539,Amy,"hey, everybody, listen up."
1148,Amy,i’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn’t so overwhelming.
2154,Amy,it’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
2442,Amy,"s, s, si, size me up?"
1955,Amy,"all right, next, we’re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate."
430,Amy,"leonard, you may not have noticed, but i am being a delight here. and you’re not holding up your end of the evening."
1027,Amy,did that ever happen?
268,Amy,"then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology."
1746,Amy,"oh. great. i’m happy for you guys. you know, when the two of you aren’t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position."
1917,Amy,i don’t hate you. i love you.
726,Amy,our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. he said it was a magical evening.
1937,Amy,"i actually can’t. my hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees. i rode a very thin pony once. on the first bump, just popped right off."
886,Amy,it’s exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.
254,Amy,"say, i heard an interesting tidbit about howard and bernadette."
1821,Amy,"bernadette is a successful microbiologist. she should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. i mean, what kind of message does that send?"
2371,Amy,that’s an interesting tie clip.
3252,Amy,"so we’re agreed, it’s complete garbage."
727,Amy,i don’t think i’d be good at that.
444,Amy,great. until i accidentally made leonard fall in love with me.
1657,Amy,"can i confess something? once in a while, i get a little jealous of how close penny and sheldon are."
2151,Amy,"leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?"
1915,Amy,"i’ve always wanted to do a traditional victorian christmas. parlour games, goose and figgy pudding."
1169,Amy,"sheldon, they’re talking about sex."
1884,Amy,"all right. don’t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now."
1924,Amy,you got me something?
395,Amy,i just have one question about the chair.
1284,Amy,i’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. isn’t that great? we could have lunch together. we could carpool. 
1571,Amy,no. what’s up?
1541,Amy,"all the time. and he knew that, as your girlfriend, i wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. i mean, a table? come on?"
1837,Amy,i guess that’s all anybody wants.
2629,Amy,she’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. this could take a while.
1918,Amy,what’s going on?
2389,Amy,"okay, what is going on?"
1823,Amy,"maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science."
1896,Amy,sheldon will move out eventually.
237,Amy,"that should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant."
3001,Amy,i’m sorry.
2504,Amy,"maybe you should get a new doctor. what, he said you can’t laugh either?"
2609,Amy,you did it. do you feel okay?
3363,Amy,i don’t think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.
1944,Amy,how’s it going in there?
38,Amy,"well, just recently, i learned that you refer to us as shamy, and i don’t like that."
1879,Amy,i’m sure he brought it.
2701,Amy,"okay, mary."
2980,Amy,thank you?
678,Amy,no. damage is done.
301,Amy,and you want me to kill her? done.
3298,Amy,i thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.
405,Amy,"not really, no."
3364,Amy,guys.
667,Amy,you hate it.
1834,Amy,nice flowers.
1529,Amy,leave.
556,Amy,what do you want me to do about it?
813,Amy,so?
3077,Amy,"if you miss me x plus one, i’ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…"
380,Amy,"five, six, seven, eight. tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…"
2678,Amy,you just did.
1098,Amy,"come on, do it with us."
3054,Amy,"this was a potential issue, so i got out ahead of it and i managed the situation for you."
2612,Amy,what did you have in mind?
1494,Amy,"ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us."
450,Amy,"now, i assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions."
2295,Amy,"sure, why not?"
3019,Amy,"i understand, but this is a special day for them. can you just try and let it go?"
2271,Amy,"oh, um, give me that."
114,Amy,"clearly, losing truth or dare upset her. perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity."
1861,Amy,what pressure? all i said was you look handsome. can you please open the door?
24,Amy,defend.
1037,Amy,like a dog-boy.
904,Amy,you gonna let him speak to me like that?
1630,Amy,you know what? how about i buy it for you? how about i buy you both?
2230,Amy,how long do you think you can keep it from him?
2583,Amy,okay.
2167,Amy,i hope you understand.
869,Amy,i think i’m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.
2668,Amy,but yes.
1836,Amy,what’s that?
2636,Amy,never have i ever honked if i liked anything.
156,Amy,"thank you, sheldon. you’re a good friend."
3435,Amy,"look, right here. red hulk is picking up thor’s hammer ’cause thor’s touching it."
1342,Amy,"can’t talk, in the zone."
2862,Amy,we’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.
3213,Amy,what’s that?
1687,Amy,"here, i made you some strawberry quik."
1706,Amy,"what do you mean, why did i come? you’re my boyfriend. i haven’t seen you in over a month. i just drove six hours to help you out. don’t you have anything to say besides why did you come?"
3198,Amy,sounds like everyone’s staying home. what do you say?
1250,Amy,"uh, let’s see. i like harps, little house on the prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…"
2594,Amy,"okay. well, i would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. so i’m gonna need a minute."
687,Amy,"originally we were painted nude. but i had him add clothes, ’cause i thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality."
2268,Amy,i’m not sure how i feel about this.
3104,Amy,what’s going on?
70,Amy,all right. 
1000,Amy,sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch. he can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich.
677,Amy,"i’m sorry, i’m just having trouble believing you right now."
1325,Amy,and what?
3299,Amy,it wasn’t a time-out. let’s get some food.
1236,Amy,really?
2543,Amy,why wouldn’t you open it?
2243,Amy,there you go.
879,Amy,i once looked in sheldon’s underwear drawer. he yelled at me. but now i know what it looks like and he can never take that away.
3065,Amy,"penny, is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here, but you don’t live here any more, so it’s basically my girls’ night?"
514,Amy,yay!
1822,Amy,i just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.
1994,Amy,good luck finding it.
1868,Amy,okay.
2043,Amy,"so, that’s the key to the door? that’s it?"
471,Amy,wait for moi.
1869,Amy,this is an easy one. you love this guy.
2934,Amy,"sheldon, i’m not ready to have a baby."
553,Amy,"penny, i said right hand red."
1800,Amy,we had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.
717,Amy,do you ever worry about leonard doing that to you?
141,Amy,my blood work shows thyroid function normal. cortisol levels normal.
1711,Amy,can i stop now?
534,Amy,i had half a glass.
480,Amy,"sheldon, what are you doing here?"
581,Amy,what’s he doing here?
2250,Amy,do you not hear how creepy that sounds?
462,Amy,"sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t making you a priority?"
1565,Amy,all right.
2464,Amy,"well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?"
1796,Amy,"better than good. i mean, look at you. your body’s bangin’."
2081,Amy,"sheldon, this article doesn’t mention leonard at all."
1280,Amy,i shouldn’t have said it. i’m sorry.
46,Amy,i’m stating it outright. babinski eats dirac for breakfast and defecates clarke-maxwell.
458,Amy,you’re kidding.
1481,Amy,"no, that’s not true. my boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. like, way worse than you."
1560,Amy,then i met sheldon and look at where we are now.
2064,Amy,"you know what? go to mars, sheldon."
2466,Amy,i think what sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. isn’t that right?
2203,Amy,fine. my old scarf.
2989,Amy,i love it. thank you.
1592,Amy,but why?
3107,Amy,"yes, you are. there have definitely been days when i was sad and you could tell."
3192,Amy,shh.
1260,Amy,ain’t no big surprise.
305,Amy,"you’re being too literal. my point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you."
1603,Amy,okay.
3134,Amy,it is warm in here.
2671,Amy,i’m getting an earthy note.
1088,Amy,our penny’s a star.
2141,Amy,"well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, i could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover."
696,Amy,there’s not a hair on my body i wouldn’t let this woman trim.
99,Amy,pillow fight!
3284,Amy,you really can’t remember anything?
344,Amy,i’m gonna say 3-d. that’ll let her know the studio has faith in it.
1866,Amy,"of course i understand. sheldon, there’s something else i’ve been wanting to say, but before i do, i just, i want you to know that you don’t have to say it back. i know you’re not ready, and i don’t want you to say it just because social convention dictates…"
2786,Amy,"well, i’m not refusing. i’m just trying to be considerate."
855,Amy,"are you sure? i mean, the nose doesn’t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk."
508,Amy,"when we first met, i made one and pretended you gave it to me. you can have it back if you want."
2833,Amy,"and if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here."
3240,Amy,"well, that would make me feel better."
1313,Amy,"sheldon, what are you doing here so late?"
2570,Amy,yes.
3238,Amy,"sheldon, this is really interesting."
1864,Amy,"well, you can relax. just because you think i look pretty doesn’t mean we have to spend the night together."
239,Amy,"you know, if being on your own is new to you, i’d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies i’ve perfected over the years. for example, do you have an electric toothbrush?"
744,Amy,"hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. i’m just trying to clean up your mess."
2674,Amy,it’s true. even einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.
1135,Amy,no.
1790,Amy,can you start in the morning?
3040,Amy,"blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
1795,Amy,it is. but enough about penny. let’s talk about us. we’re looking good.
3439,Amy,"sheldon, stop. for the last time, i will not bring home bed bugs. "
3149,Amy,"oh, no. are you sure you don’t want to give her a few more minutes?"
971,Amy,i could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next star trek movie.
455,Amy,"sheldon, i know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?"
3171,Amy,can i hear one?
575,Amy,how was your day?
2844,Amy,that’s an odd mix of people.
2264,Amy,"well, actually, he, he already did."
595,Amy,"if he were dying, would you sleep with him?"
1595,Amy,"dun, dun, dun. he started it."
1358,Amy,what are you working on?
3397,Amy,vigorously?
2238,Amy,"okay. okay. fine. hi, mom."
1768,Amy,"i’m with him three years, nothing. she’s with him two minutes, and he’s taking his pants off."
1327,Amy,what are you talking about?
1403,Amy,"uh, we’re trying to cheer him up, so… "
2830,Amy,me. it was mittens.
2914,Amy,"sheldon, if i’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, i need to harvest them. now, i’ve done this dozens of times, but if you’re too scared you don’t have to."
1832,Amy,"i disagree. as a female scientist, i think what you do affects all of us."
1875,Amy,"sheldon, it’s a routine procedure, i’ve heard you complain about his snoring."
2687,Amy,do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?
3092,Amy,it’s amazing a machine can do that.
2885,Amy,you stop that.
827,Amy,"oh, hello. who are you?"
408,Amy,"oh, sure."
2047,Amy,let’s say it together.
1082,Amy,why? what happened?
1463,Amy,"why? because sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think i have any other options? i’m just kidding. i’ll get my purse."
1226,Amy,do you hear anything?
3371,Amy,"sheldon, that isn’t necessary."
2139,Amy,we both know this one’s gonna win.
1315,Amy,what do you want?
2549,Amy,these things go for five hundred dollars and up.
2723,Amy,does that help?
1364,Amy,"at work today, i did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery."
151,Amy,"you reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?"
2897,Amy,it’s kind of exciting. i mean we could do whatever we want.
147,Amy,are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?
1477,Amy,"hello, bert."
1092,Amy,"me, too."
1770,Amy,you really went your entire life without anyone saying i hate you to your face?
1153,Amy,"yeah, sounds like a drag."
2327,Amy,"man, i walked right into that one."
1967,Amy,sheldon.
124,Amy,it’s no mystery. i obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset tourette’s syndrome.
2412,Amy,that works for me.
2579,Amy,"oh, but he said you can get store credit."
3424,Amy,"sheldon, are you all right? when last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from raj’s, but according to facebook, you just checked in at the cheesecake factory."
1485,Amy,so what am i supposed to do now?
3099,Amy,what’s that? are you working on your resume?
2879,Amy,let it go.
1425,Amy,"wait, did she die or did you kill her?"
539,Amy,"no, i’m having a nice time."
2949,Amy,that was a close one.
513,Amy,really?
934,Amy,why not?
3204,Amy,hi.
325,Amy,"by accepting the invitation, bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. she could ferret out priya’s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, leonard’s no stranger to back-alley cockfights."
2303,Amy,"no, you’re not."
3328,Amy,"his mother warned me. everybody warned me. actually, he warned me."
426,Amy,"when you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist."
656,Amy,"no, no, before i met you, i was a mousy wallflower. but look at me now. i’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. with a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. open it. open it."
2313,Amy,no one can go with you?
1293,Amy,sheldon. i already signed the contract. i cashed a cheque. 
2836,Amy,oh. really?
2158,Amy,can you believe it’s been five years since our first date?
1514,Amy,an alcoa fa-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 pullman first-class coaches.
2468,Amy,"okay, and we are live in 22 minutes."
1504,Amy,"item 28, your pet name for me. time’s running out on this. you need to make a decision."
2510,Amy,what?
2532,Amy,oh. penny says everyone’s there. are you ready?
986,Amy,let’s get him laid!
3195,Amy,"oh, my god, stop talking."
648,Amy,that’s not an apology.
321,Amy,of course. how does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? by going after its weakest member.
2367,Amy,"so, a little silver lining."
152,Amy,"that’s not your lunch, sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens."
3228,Amy,you need to stop hanging out with your brain so much. it’s not a good influence.
1181,Amy,oh.
1783,Amy,ooh. there’s a cover band in the lounge.
1407,Amy,you should probably go.
1090,Amy,i haven’t been to disneyland since i was a kid. we should definitely go one weekend.
757,Amy,may i offer you something to drink?
1591,Amy,what’s it for?
2222,Amy,piercing my ears.
3153,Amy,so the part where he got stood up didn’t clue you in?
1039,Amy,great. here i am!
659,Amy,"so, uh, where are you gonna hang it?"
888,Amy,sorry.
2526,Amy,you realize none of those things would happen now?
2927,Amy,"so, enough about us, how are things going with you?"
3408,Amy,you don’t get it. i’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. all she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.
3242,Amy,"oh, good. what are they?"
988,Amy,the two of them? i don’t understand.
295,Amy,"oh, that’s just ricky."
2227,Amy,"you’re right. i should probably let all of my facebook friends know. penny, i’m no longer in a relationship."
2426,Amy,"no, no, not just that. i mean, detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting."
1104,Amy,"oh, it’s okay, i’m used to it. the other day at whole foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle."
1905,Amy,"say, betsy ross, what you working on?"
836,Amy,"i’m not suspicious. i just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant.  aha!"
2347,Amy,"hi, sheldon. i’m just driving home from my mother’s."
1734,Amy,that’s outrageous.
1102,Amy,"the world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds."
2384,Amy,"okay. good night. wait. um, sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?"
885,Amy,"you know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises."
2106,Amy,who cares? did they mention leonard?
2657,Amy,but you always say that you want to win a nobel prize.
3227,Amy,i don’t know. i just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.
921,Amy,"well, i mean, howard’s never gonna go to space again, but sheldon will always be a genius."
3468,Amy,i didn’t understand your e-mail.
996,Amy,"i do. and don’t worry, someday you’ll have somebody, too."
523,Amy,what is taking you so long? 
1436,Amy,i am in the mix. and i’m the hottest one.
3422,Amy,"well, normally i respect your macho rebellious attitude toward the man, but, in this case, i think you’ve made a foolish mistake."
1636,Amy,i can’t feel my legs.
1164,Amy,i’m sorry. i feel like such an idiot.
2749,Amy,okay. i feel so bad about leaving him here.
479,Amy,"that’s cool, that’s cool."
2904,Amy,hi.
2377,Amy,what?
1551,Amy,rajesh?
2119,Amy,"well, that was an exciting 40 seconds."
1370,Amy,"i must say, sheldon, you’re handling this dvd business with an impressive amount of maturity."
21,Amy,does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?
2812,Amy,do you want to go to our place and make out?
1622,Amy,no.
489,Amy,proposal. one wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.
1649,Amy,i feel so bad about lying to sheldon. how am i gonna make it up to him?
1278,Amy,"sheldon, we’re in a relationship. when you get angry, just tell me. you don’t need to seek revenge."
1717,Amy,see? this trip was good for you.
2558,Amy,"deaw aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?"
1401,Amy,"sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did."
3307,Amy,"you know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak. yes, starting now."
1476,Amy,that’s nice.
440,Amy,"i excel at spatial reasoning, and i had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely."
1389,Amy,ooh!
308,Amy,it most assuredly is not.
1402,Amy,"sheldon, the point is wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things."
2714,Amy,"hear, hear."
2777,Amy,"look, i know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. so why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we’re more settled in, we can revisit it."
2917,Amy,"okay. three, two, and we’re done."
2030,Amy,why?
3386,Amy,i won’t.
762,Amy,we’re playing doctor. star trek style.
2359,Amy,why not? he’s actually a very nice guy.
2854,Amy,"uh, no. he, he just means that you were the first people we thought of."
3244,Amy,"sheldon, if we’re gonna have ground rules, i’ll tell you the first ground rule. i make the ground rules."
3051,Amy,"well, let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip."
3385,Amy,"i don’t know what they look like, but sure."
1538,Amy,"i’m not surprised you want to end the relationship. i’m a little surprised you didn’t get applecare. anyway, enjoy your life. where do i sign?"
1972,Amy,"i’m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night."
376,Amy,"for the first time ever, i have a thriving social life. and no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you."
1589,Amy,"hey, i found something. it looks like a little man with a briefcase."
1678,Amy,yeah. we were hoping it might cheer you up.
2840,Amy,i’m sorry i mentioned it.
1999,Amy,you’re just making fun of me.
1597,Amy,"actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. fyi, we plan on selling out the human race hard."
2698,Amy,then i graciously accept.
2400,Amy,"um, that sounds nice, but i’m not really hungry right now. i thought maybe we could do presents first."
2472,Amy,catchy.
1456,Amy,i don’t think i want to go out with you anymore.
1650,Amy,did you lie to howard about tonight?
318,Amy,she always this crabby when she urinates?
2190,Amy,thank you.
1978,Amy,"it’s one thing to make yourself miserable, but you’re making everyone around you miserable, too. now, i’m telling you for the last time, take the cap off."
2666,Amy,i don’t know. i really don’t know.
272,Amy,bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. the meme has reached full penetration.
1175,Amy,and now?
1107,Amy,"boy, i’m really curious what was in that letter."
23,Amy,"in a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the second world war?"
2677,Amy,"uh, mostly penny’s heard them."
3365,Amy,i don’t know. sheldon’s so vulnerable right now.
3083,Amy,uh-huh.
982,Amy,maybe another time.
1296,Amy,"yes. before all things, i’m a scientist. i’m just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys."
448,Amy,"oh, penny, much as i would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, leonard just doesn’t get my motor running."
15,Amy,no.
48,Amy,"yes, but if i’m successful, i will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm."
590,Amy,no.
1247,Amy,i think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together.
2323,Amy,"no, the one in bakersfield."
1409,Amy,i’ll get the vodka.
858,Amy,yes.
1537,Amy,yeah. you actually do have room for one up there.
568,Amy,how about donating some of your clothes?
3420,Amy,still nothing. remind me to try again in an hour.
2091,Amy,exactly.
1083,Amy,"sheldon, that’s very rude. she helped you with your show. the right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play."
924,Amy,"yeah, well, at least when we do make love, sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother. and yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb."
3379,Amy,is it?
2855,Amy,"stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people."
1848,Amy,easy.
969,Amy,i feel terrible i did this.
776,Amy,"all right, that’s enough from the both of you."
3389,Amy,thank you. that means a lot.
482,Amy,"sheldon, my world is crumbling around me."
1803,Amy,"hey, penny, hey, let’s go. we found a place that has australian male strippers."
2465,Amy,"oh, sheldon, thank you."
1070,Amy,what’s this?
67,Amy,wait. i have a request.
3348,Amy,got to go. morning.
2940,Amy,"hey, you’re talking about the person i love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. oh, man. "
367,Amy,"you can’t blame yourself. when your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. we neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex."
1920,Amy,"well, there’s a fun one called ball of wool. you take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off."
2524,Amy,can you please just tell me why?
939,Amy,are you okay?
1949,Amy,basket weaving at the craft museum.
1928,Amy,"well, you got me something. here."
2177,Amy,"if you must know, i’m going to howard and bernadette’s to watch the wedding."
2653,Amy,because you were defending sheldon like you always do.
779,Amy,"oh, yes. according to the relationship agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy."
2034,Amy,"oh, then i choose a janitor, ’cause i’m about to throw up."
2166,Amy,"okay, well, this isn’t easy to say, because i love you, but i need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation."
1211,Amy,sure.
1014,Amy,yes.
903,Amy,he was overacting on purpose.
1577,Amy,"well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off."
11,Amy,dandruff shampoo. i have dry scalp.
544,Amy,interesting. now try it without the quadruple negative.
2492,Amy,it really can.
547,Amy,"yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door."
2138,Amy,and mcblanket over sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count. oh. ten o’clock. date night’s over.
326,Amy,don’t worry. i’ll teach you. i did two years of cub scouts before they found out i was a girl.
3170,Amy,interesting. you really have secrets you don’t tell me?
671,Amy,don’t bother.
1974,Amy,you don’t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.
637,Amy,really? is that what you think?
979,Amy,"oh, great! i’ve always wanted to play dungeons and dragons."
3349,Amy,are you feeling okay?
1520,Amy,see if you guys can guess this one. bang. splat. thud.
2832,Amy,"you know, you’re right. i’m in this relationship, too. i need to stand up for myself."
1982,Amy,have you even seen it?
1072,Amy,"in case of emergency, please contact… amy farrah fowler. and there’s my phone number. this is the most beautiful gift you could’ve ever given me."
3029,Amy,i was afraid you’d be too tired.
1132,Amy,"professor tupperman is dead, and that makes us?"
2574,Amy,whatch me.
2236,Amy,easy for you to say. you never had to watch 60 minutes like this.
3256,Amy,"fine. fine. you want me to blow my nose? here, i’ll blow it. better?"
1416,Amy,"oh, i love that movie."
2641,Amy,"well, i get why he’s annoyed."
710,Amy,"i had to go to my aunt’s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where’s this boyfriend you’re always talking about? is he real, or did you make him up like armin the miniature horse breeder?"
1874,Amy,did they figure out what’s wrong?
2720,Amy,you’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
1371,Amy,is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?
899,Amy,"you’ll have to forgive me. this is my first time directing, i just want it to be good."
3005,Amy,and the mood continues to change.
1467,Amy,he’s nice.
3039,Amy,"sheldon, don’t overreact."
562,Amy,who would have thought fuzzy fingers fowler is best friends with a bully?
604,Amy,penny?
368,Amy,where are we going?
999,Amy,"she’s right. but say the word, i got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. one of them could end up in the backseat of her car. or her shower."
1392,Amy,i know how you feel. sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that roomba vacuum. i kick it when he’s not looking.
2045,Amy,we have some exciting news.
1927,Amy,"actually, i did get you something."
908,Amy,you sure you wouldn’t rather have dinner with your friend wil wheaton?
920,Amy,"i know, sheldon should just let howard have his little moment in the sun."
716,Amy,yeah.
2617,Amy,we could all go for the weekend. it’ll be fun.
891,Amy,you’re smart.
2882,Amy,why are you speaking klingon?
605,Amy,penny?
1470,Amy,he’s not my boyfriend.
1471,Amy,should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?
2744,Amy,"well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. i don’t know why i called it a party, sorry."
3380,Amy,do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?
3101,Amy,"come on, sheldon, let’s go."
2232,Amy,"actually, the joke was on her. i could still see the tv through the slats."
653,Amy,"you’re forgiven. now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. they’re still dirty from yesterday."
1309,Amy,you know what? i don’t have time for this. find another way home.
2229,Amy,why?
2785,Amy,"well, sheldon, i really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want."
1205,Amy,so i can drink this without having to give up the goodies?
2768,Amy,"so, is that a yes?"
902,Amy,cut.
144,Amy,"let’s look at this logically. i have a stomach, i get hungry. i have genitals, i have the potential for sexual arousal."
3294,Amy,almost 200. many of them on purpose.
281,Amy,"fair warning, we can get ker-razy."
2069,Amy,i think i’m gonna go home.
1452,Amy,"sheldon, you scared me. that wasn’t funny."
1512,Amy,it doesn’t. i know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster.
3003,Amy,what’s wrong?
3050,Amy,what about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?
1237,Amy,you want to take the bus to work?
104,Amy,"remember, you have to answer honestly."
2458,Amy,"sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?"
234,Amy,yes.
1886,Amy,fine. it’s sweet that you care about him so much.
1553,Amy,i think we’re gonna go.
1297,Amy,more and more sure.
2497,Amy,and a lovely valentine’s day.
3229,Amy,"i want to say aw, but i’m gonna say ew."
1453,Amy,"okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. i mean, humour is a complex neurological…  okay, that’s pretty good."
2974,Amy,it may have appreciated in value. the artist killed himself shortly after painting that.
2508,Amy,"me, me, me too. i’m a grown-up and i’ve done it."
290,Amy,"how come if we’re the smart people, we don’t do this every night?"
2388,Amy,i think i’ll just stick to mexican.
1141,Amy,should have taken my breasts out while i had the chance.
427,Amy,would you like to dance?
3069,Amy,"uh, penny, i don’t know how to say this, but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out. "
960,Amy,i don’t have a bath thermometer.
3338,Amy,where are you moving?
857,Amy,"long division, long division. go, go, go."
1079,Amy,did you tell penny how helpful she was?
128,Amy,"no, i experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so i’m checking my vital signs every hour."
2516,Amy,he used a period instead of a question mark. he’s so wasted.
2102,Amy,we won’t know if there’s equality until female thor has a baby and the avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.
1159,Amy,so there are some rules.
1680,Amy,"sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. she got hurt."
589,Amy,how come you never invite sheldon and me on a double date?
3222,Amy,this isn’t about me and sheldon. this is about rajesh moving in with leonard and penny.
231,Amy,good. now put this pillowcase over your head.
2324,Amy,are we done discussing the weather?
3306,Amy,"oh. you know, good for you."
2828,Amy,it’s just so much easier to give him what he wants.
1725,Amy,"okay, so no bernadette."
2528,Amy,"okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?"
1627,Amy,how old were you then?
957,Amy,maybe we should start with that.
3374,Amy,i am.
2016,Amy,"it’s not a big deal. i run tests like this on undergrads all the time. if you fill out some paperwork at the university, i can get you five dollars."
3287,Amy,do you need anything else?
2853,Amy,things didn’t work out?
1970,Amy,"sheldon. sheldon, i’m worried about you. you’re not eating, you haven’t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell."
2741,Amy,i’ll be right back.
1427,Amy,i don’t know.
2486,Amy,now?
3175,Amy,"so when i got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, i didn’t have to?"
1945,Amy,sure.
3292,Amy,"now, i’m sure many of you are wondering how fun with flags began. "
1639,Amy,sorry i’m late. what did you do?
100,Amy,my nails have never looked so pretty before. get it off.
2221,Amy,"actually, i was thinking of making one small change."
832,Amy,sheldon told me he had a new assistant named alex. he didn’t mention that alex was a girl.
1399,Amy,"sheldon, can i come in?"
795,Amy,dessert is served.
2483,Amy,"look, i know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship."
3143,Amy,"sheldon, there’s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom."
2774,Amy,"that’s me. listen, you and i are gonna be sharing a bed. you know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. how are you feeling about that?"
1820,Amy,i think it’s awful.
3429,Amy,"guys, something happened."
2635,Amy,never have i ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
2258,Amy,i don’t know.
2501,Amy,i wouldn’t make too much out of howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
3096,Amy,okay. what does it say i’m feeling?
3191,Amy,hi. 
1503,Amy,"maybe the guys are right. i mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. i’m sure they’re having more fun than we are."
222,Amy,"fine. from this angle, i can see up your nose."
385,Amy,"well, that’s every song i know. what’s up?"
2164,Amy,"oh, sure, i’d love to."
2776,Amy,"well, i imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations. "
340,Amy,i used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. it was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. hang on. it’s the wildebeest. priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
2057,Amy,"you applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?"
1354,Amy,how do you not know how to use glue? did you ditch pre-school?
2919,Amy,"okay, fine, one."
2338,Amy,"so it’s like kiss, marry, kill."
2027,Amy,no.
2220,Amy,but then i decided i don’t want to go changing who i am just because of some man.
851,Amy,"uh, hand. uh, nail, polish?"
1540,Amy,of course not. this is just leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. he’s manipulating you like he always does.
3093,Amy,"all right. now, i’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately."
3412,Amy,"hello, sheldon."
1873,Amy,hello.
2277,Amy,"well, i don’t have much experience dating, so i decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little."
1218,Amy,"oh, and here’s a fun thing. i worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. janko is spelled with a silent ptang. sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language."
3089,Amy,i’m sure it’s extremely frustrating.
139,Amy,there was no question. i simply said hoo.
2489,Amy,"i have an idea. maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting rajesh. ladies, i can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…"
2610,Amy,"well, i’m proud of you."
2116,Amy,eight-five.
2300,Amy,i have a dvd of that lecture.
1628,Amy,what’s a zune?
1572,Amy,i have.
2144,Amy,you got yourself a sleepover.
1077,Amy,"oh, that’s right. how’d it go with penny?"
91,Amy,all right. i’ll have to go shopping.
235,Amy,"if you’d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn’t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber."
867,Amy,why?
3000,Amy,"so, where were we?"
1618,Amy,this is a nightmare. how will you ever make a decision?
2721,Amy,"sheldon, you’re mother’s an attractive woman. you need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her."
2257,Amy,"well, i was hoping the next person i dated would be a little less like sheldon."
296,Amy,don’t be silly. he’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study.
354,Amy,have you considered massage?
753,Amy,"human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. in your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. i’m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me."
420,Amy,"i would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. he behaved like a child the entire time."
2473,Amy,"okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, i already pushed the button. never mind, we’re live."
1870,Amy,"come on, he’s an under-appreciated genius."
1240,Amy,"scavenger hunts at harvard were really tough. i always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. i guess that story’s more sad than funny."
1469,Amy,so? he does that every day. oh.
2952,Amy,"honestly, i just want you to be quiet but i’m all out of taffy."
1405,Amy,"sheldon, it’s a beautiful night. why don’t you and i go for a nice walk together?"
1484,Amy,"no, it’s not."
1931,Amy,okay. the next game is called hot boiled beans.
181,Amy,not necessary. penny and i are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.
2291,Amy,"that’s a good question. after five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be."
2638,Amy,"well, we all have a past."
172,Amy,"don’t worry, penny. you’re my plus-one. you’ll bunk with me. and fyi, travel makes me constipated, so i’m the ideal hotel roommate."
3428,Amy,"everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. everybody hurts, sometimes."
817,Amy,"yes, please, penny will kill me."
3471,Amy,sorry.
327,Amy,how do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
2103,Amy,sheldon.
453,Amy,i don’t understand. what differences does it make if leonard goes to wil wheaton’s party?
1057,Amy,what?
2001,Amy,"she turned away, wiping her eyes. she couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. it was cooper."
1975,Amy,that’s not true.
783,Amy,"oh, boo-hoo. if sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go."
600,Amy,"me, too. out of deference to them, let’s not flaunt our happy relationship."
2390,Amy,what surprises?
2601,Amy,"it’s okay, sheldon. you know, i’ve saved a lot of weird things, too."
2101,Amy,"ooh, please do, rajesh."
1366,Amy,we’re never getting our drinks.
2815,Amy,"sheldon, i understand that you like things a certain way and i’m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise."
1446,Amy,congratulations.
2112,Amy,have you made a decision about the tardis? i think i can sell it if we call it big british porta-potty.
981,Amy,by rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?
4,Amy,excuse me. i’m amy farrah fowler. you’re sheldon cooper.
1101,Amy,"it’s our pleasure. i’m dr. fowler, and i’m a neuroscientist."
2852,Amy,"oh, they’re pretty. thank you."
1881,Amy,"i’m odd all the time, everyone knows that. just last night i tried to see how many fava beans i could fit in my mouth."
977,Amy,then maybe you should spank me harder.
1289,Amy,i’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together.
369,Amy,really? a best friend sleepover? yay.
1516,Amy,i’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. work with me.
2781,Amy,shall we?
1579,Amy,"look, i admit that it’s odd that rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. as a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty."
3279,Amy,"well, i don’t want your germs around me."
2804,Amy,the kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.
226,Amy,i’m not saying that you’re not fun. you’re the most fun person i know.
2272,Amy,"no, no, stop reading that."
2902,Amy,how about if i just don’t breathe at all?
812,Amy,penny said she’s not sure she wants to be leonard’s girlfriend anymore.
693,Amy,"well, i don’t know. i think you might look sexy with long hair. the kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. i’m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while."
30095,Raj,what are you working on?
31667,Raj,in a new delhi minute.
32569,Raj,"come on howard, fire it in."
32074,Raj,hold on. we do that all the time. you and i work together and play together.
33950,Raj,"i’m sorry, guys. sheldon was upset, leonard and penny were fighting, i just wanted to go some place where i wasn’t causing problems."
32904,Raj,"one jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup."
29768,Raj,we just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
31882,Raj,just tell me which one you think is more manly. this hockey jersey or this football jersey.
33809,Raj,"uh, heads up, both of you are named emily, so we’ll call you red-headed emily, and you, red-headed emily, junior."
29917,Raj,"sheldon, if you don’t like this stuff, let’s just go next door and build her a bear."
32316,Raj,"thank you. that was the closest i’ve come to sex in, like, two years."
32768,Raj,we hope. the signal has to travel over three billion miles. so it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
30174,Raj,engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
31475,Raj,i’m all for it.
34129,Raj,where indeed.
30647,Raj,i’m a lamb.
30130,Raj,chickens can’t climb trees
30268,Raj,"oh, what a coincidence. maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament. sign here."
32952,Raj,"okay, that sounds good."
30279,Raj,"problem, wil wheaton?"
29920,Raj,okay. what shall be first to taste the wrath of monte?
29873,Raj,are you sure?
33814,Raj,"oh. he’s here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him."
32156,Raj,"great. that makes one of you. okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. that’s right, i see you. okay, if you have any questions, i’ll be over here basting my ass off. focus is key."
31355,Raj,"now who’s dying of jealousy? oh, it’s you."
32506,Raj,no.
31845,Raj,only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
32882,Raj,"this looks terrible. she, she’s gonna know."
30471,Raj,"and worst of all, fin fang foom."
31427,Raj,bring him to his bony knees.
32733,Raj,"yeah, me, too."
31205,Raj,"well, i choose love."
30410,Raj,"that’s professor wilkinson’s wife, she’s like 80 years old."
32163,Raj,"well, i couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. martha stewart and rachael ray."
31325,Raj,"oh, yeah. there’s a reason he’s sir elton john. they don’t make you a knight for writing wake me up before you go go."
30551,Raj,"yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from men in black."
32943,Raj,"well, they’re looking to include a message from earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life."
31312,Raj,they put you under for a cleaning?
30060,Raj,"a prostitute, yes."
29990,Raj,it’s loosely based on my life.
31179,Raj,"fine. tell her i have a deep, sexy voice like james earl jones."
30210,Raj,halfway is 600 miles off the coast of japan.
32388,Raj,can we please get back to the game?
30260,Raj,"hey, sheldon, guess what i heard today?"
32386,Raj,"oh, no. in this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after i became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, madonna."
33784,Raj,"hold on. yeah, that’s funny."
31070,Raj,i got a colossal serpent right here.
31076,Raj,"she’s kidding, right?"
32413,Raj,"as a matter of fact, i did. i’ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, i’m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. whatever it may be, the answer’s going to be yes."
30654,Raj,if i don’t have to boom-boom.
32004,Raj,and then some. i think we had a moment.
31231,Raj,"oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?"
29596,Raj,"i’ve got some feelers out. in the meantime, listen to this."
33705,Raj,"excuse me, but i’m indian."
33079,Raj,"here, let me try. you’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way."
33764,Raj,"i bought the first one, it didn’t fall."
31110,Raj,"hey, you totally got that right! e equals m c squared."
33516,Raj,"yeah, of course. what else could it be? boy, do i love america."
30391,Raj,"dude, there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. look. at the glendale galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it’s a salute to swing music in the center court near macy’s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? a salute to zoot. sounds like a hoot."
32193,Raj,maybe this time he’s going to do it.
31395,Raj,"like, dude on dude, but with women?"
30527,Raj,all right. imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. where is that?
32335,Raj,"okay, i’m getting some mixed messages here."
33191,Raj,"oh. did you know, at the united nations, there’s a department for outer space affairs?"
33280,Raj,what is wrong with you?
29909,Raj,booya.
30449,Raj,the big-boobed weather girl on channel 2?
30525,Raj,i’m not going to punch you.
32988,Raj,"look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. ooh, do you own a t-shirt cannon?"
31552,Raj,it’s funny because bread sounds like dead.
33023,Raj,"yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much."
30585,Raj,"did you get a cold, too?"
32562,Raj,is that right?
31692,Raj,"leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well i was only six to eight months away from making my move."
31645,Raj,"miss congeniality 2: armed and fabulous. i mean, you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl sandy b can’t save it."
34150,Raj,hey.
32241,Raj,he’ll be so upset. he’ll probably climb up the empire state building and start swatting at planes.
32455,Raj,you’re a good son. i don’t know how you do it.
32468,Raj,and play.
32519,Raj,"thank you. not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen."
32591,Raj,"well, i would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list."
32966,Raj,"okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well."
31026,Raj,what are you doing?
31242,Raj,"hey, look, the new warlords of ka’a expansion pack is out."
32641,Raj,"look, i get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, i was thinking about when howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment."
31852,Raj,"born in new delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, i showed early signs of genius. at the age of five i discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon."
31637,Raj,"okay, here’s another one: if a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie? or a zompire?"
31504,Raj,you sure?
32389,Raj,"oh, come on."
34079,Raj,i think you made that very clear.
30466,Raj,"bruce banner, reed richards, sue storm, stephen strange, otto octavius, silver surfer, peter parker, oh, and worst of all, j. jonah jameson, jr."
33000,Raj,"no, you have to put this back together right now, so i can return it."
33211,Raj,"so, all right, there he is. so, should we introduce ourselves?"
30343,Raj,"yeah, that would have been great. you and penny having sex in the tent while i sit out here and watch howard hump a cactus."
31740,Raj,"really, smart guy? where’s he supposed to park his sweet little corvette?"
29723,Raj,why?
32601,Raj,i’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store.
30357,Raj,i would be kind to my rabbit subjects. at first.
29938,Raj,"no one’s arguing with you, dude."
21787,Raj,"oh, yeah, i saw that. that was hilarious. "
31938,Raj,"so, anyway, last night on video chat, i spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into lucy’s eyes."
31488,Raj,"i was, but it’s their anniversary and i didn’t want to be a third wheel, so i figured i’d come over here and hang out with you and penny on your date."
33943,Raj,"maybe moving in was a bad idea. i haven’t been here one day, i’m already causing problems."
32461,Raj,i’m just gonna say it. that’s not okay. why can’t i be in a relationship with a girl who likes the sound of music?
33680,Raj,"i love kids, how old is he?"
31022,Raj,"i don’t want to hug you, either. i was just feeling blue."
33655,Raj,"yeah, but it’s probably difficult to pronounce."
33257,Raj,"so i was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names."
32041,Raj,oh.
32179,Raj,hang on.
30405,Raj,"come on, let’s get a drink."
31465,Raj,"what, we’re ready when i say we’re ready. uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we’re ready."
32739,Raj,can we please talk about anything else?
33424,Raj,"oh, man, when i come out of the closet, i’m gonna nail those guys. yeah, i heard it. shut up."
33237,Raj,low self-esteem.
31974,Raj,"what’s like, what is wrong with me? why, why can’t i ever have love?"
31416,Raj,i think we already have. thank you guys so much. let’s see if you fit in my man purse.
30455,Raj,no. is he still mad about the supercollider?
29916,Raj,"whoa. humongous man crush, dude."
32583,Raj,"you know, he might not reopen. he didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company."
30511,Raj,then let go of the ring and go.
30404,Raj,did you really have to bring it in with you?
33289,Raj,"yeah, that’s true. in fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it."
30541,Raj,"really? because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions."
31743,Raj,and we made it in only three hours. sounds just like store-bought.
32713,Raj,"i think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew."
31289,Raj,what are you doing right now?
30533,Raj,you own the damn thing. just take a freaking sweater!
31228,Raj,you have a thing of paper clips right there.
32445,Raj,"she’s scary, but it’s a cute scary."
33310,Raj,"hi. hi. yeah, it’s raj. rajesh. we met at the comic book store."
29795,Raj,"oh, okay, how about this. you can go dressed as a star trek science officer exploring a planet similar to earth in the 1500s."
32123,Raj,thank you. it wasn’t easy.
29653,Raj,the living room appears to be empty. 
30396,Raj,"come on, sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. let’s go outside. outside is good."
31566,Raj,"you’re welcome, ladies."
32805,Raj,come on.
34172,Raj,"oh, that’s claire. got to run."
30694,Raj,no.
32052,Raj,"okay, uh, let’s try it again. uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you."
32302,Raj,it’s pretty exciting that nasa wants to send howard back up.
33162,Raj,and you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?
33798,Raj,"it’s okay, i’m fine."
33900,Raj,like a business manager?
33230,Raj,it is.
34122,Raj,you are my heart!
30393,Raj,"oh. i always thought that was some sort of after-christmas sale. well, then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?"
30225,Raj,"all right, let’s buckle down and work."
30438,Raj,how long can he keep this up?
33311,Raj,"actually, that’s why i’m calling. i, um, i just, i need to let you know that i have a girlfriend."
31032,Raj,"sheldon, listen to me. i have a big decision to make, and i’m scared."
30839,Raj,water demon.
30072,Raj,"of course you feel terrible. you completely screwed up your karma, dude."
32250,Raj,"oh, they only have thursday and sunday passes left."
33951,Raj,can i just stay in the garage?
30442,Raj,i’m on a cloud. swing me. 
33601,Raj,"if you want, you can find out right now."
32433,Raj,she’s very real.
32428,Raj,at least now i can focus all my energies on just one girl.
30113,Raj,"i’m sorry, this does not look like texas. where’s the tumbleweeds? where’s the saloons?"
33722,Raj,"oh, but i bought chinese takeout."
29854,Raj,i’m taking you home.
31054,Raj,"sheldon, that’s my water."
32015,Raj,"well, it’s kind of hard to tell. "
33834,Raj,"hey, i was being hypothetical, okay? i would never marry you."
30558,Raj,i haven’t had sex in a year.
34153,Raj,what is wrong with you?
30660,Raj,"well, if that’s the case, penny will have to get satellite tv and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place."
34039,Raj,"i disagree. penny is a strong, independent woman. the more you try to control her, the more she’ll push back."
31779,Raj,everything okay?
30604,Raj,why don’t you ask her to come up?
30950,Raj,"yes, it is. very cool!"
33038,Raj,"baloney, okay? you two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as i am."
33462,Raj,"really? because usually we walk side by side, and i just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom."
30007,Raj,"i like green lantern, i’m just saying it’s pretty lame that he can be defeated by the colour yellow."
33382,Raj,"seriously, guys, i don’t want to know."
34006,Raj,these here parts?
33996,Raj,it’s right here.
31948,Raj,okay. i have a request to make.
31469,Raj,i believe you two have prepared vows?
30164,Raj,in my fanny pack.
33134,Raj,why do you need kripke? can’t you just go to party city for helium?
29641,Raj,hoo-hoo-hoo. the only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.” 
30220,Raj,all right.
30274,Raj,"sorry, boys. say hi to your mother when she picks you up. or i could just tell her later tonight! we pwned them, dude! up top!"
30252,Raj,how did you get here?
30996,Raj,"oh, no. i hope everything’s okay."
34052,Raj,"yeah, sure."
33794,Raj,"i don’t know, she didn’t even give me a reason."
21788,Raj,"okay, do you have an opinion about everything?"
31912,Raj,"i got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. and i had a sensible salad for lunch, so i can eat all the pizza i want."
31484,Raj,i don’t understand.
33881,Raj,"well, then double it, because my building’s a lot nicer than this dump."
29595,Raj,find new friends. 
30126,Raj,"whatever, dude. the point is, leonard’s got one and you don’t."
31035,Raj,that’s not the point.
33908,Raj,i have no choice.
30463,Raj,"that’s a great idea, i’m going to get him to sign a batman as well."
21791,Raj,"me, too."
32742,Raj,"uh, no. you had a long flight. you stay here and relax."
29924,Raj,what’s going on?
31609,Raj,"great, what’s your pl… "
31947,Raj,of course.
32873,Raj,i can’t get emily’s night-stand to close.
30978,Raj,"yeah, we’re coming for you, todd zarnecki. and for the record, legoland is more interactive."
33837,Raj,"uh, the one at caltech has a crazy wait list. i warned you, a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant."
30880,Raj,what did i do?
33121,Raj,when was the last actual exercise you got?
30577,Raj,"oh, come on. i don’t want to sit by myself."
30165,Raj,are you happy now?
31818,Raj,"oh, i totally am. if it wasn’t for this beer, i couldn’t even talk to you right now. i’m a wreck. there are many things seriously wrong with me. and not quirks, either. like, diagnosable psychological problems. maybe brain damage."
31744,Raj,"oh, i wish i was in better shape."
33393,Raj,"no, i kind of feel like being alone right now."
32887,Raj,how was the hospital?
33405,Raj,"hey, so, listen, claire, change of plans…"
31420,Raj,"that’s really nice of you, howard."
32367,Raj,you can’t leave. you’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of stuart bloom.
33208,Raj,"it’s not creepy. i built a footprints on the moon fan page, trent joined it."
21790,Raj,fine.
31747,Raj,"wow, that’s harsh."
32881,Raj,did that feel good? you feel like a big man now?
30676,Raj,you have a desk.
33633,Raj,"though if you did, it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting."
33021,Raj,"i do. and some of it’s wool, so dry flat if possible."
31652,Raj,"yeah, okay, howard wins."
31042,Raj,"my name is dr. rajesh koothrappali, and this is my friend dr. sheldon cooper."
34076,Raj,i made a play for her and she shot me down.
33748,Raj,"well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. some day she’s gonna want to see this."
31827,Raj,"excuse me, i’m meeting a girl here. it’s kind of our first date."
33783,Raj,"okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?"
29933,Raj,"but, sheldon, we don’t have a chance. the only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote."
33338,Raj,"no, sheldon’s right. emily did say i always talk about my feelings too much."
30320,Raj,"yeah. absolutely. it wouldn’t kill you to take a pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal."
30332,Raj,you brought your mother into this!
29569,Raj,i thought she was the whore of omaha?
31222,Raj,i’m so lonely.
32824,Raj,"smart, looks like we’re being helpful."
29567,Raj,how about soup?
32014,Raj,"nice. so, mmm. what’s up?"
31135,Raj,"penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this."
30465,Raj,i can’t wait to ask stan lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.
31858,Raj,i have a thick accent. you don’t know what i said.
29850,Raj,what right do you have to pick who i can have children with?
34009,Raj,yeah.
32566,Raj,i’m heckling you. it’s a beloved part of baseball.
32552,Raj,"hey, as long as the baby’s healthy."
30824,Raj,it’s easy. the spider’s crawling up your arm.
33254,Raj,"come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery."
30136,Raj,be careful.
33770,Raj,"oh, my god, what happened?"
32549,Raj,"you know what? you’re my best friend, and she’s in a bad marriage. i give you my blessing."
33986,Raj,"hang on, i’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy. i just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place."
29686,Raj,"he’s using psychological warfare. we must reply in kind. i say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you. "
33138,Raj,"oh, fun. let me see. uh, no, no, uh, definitely not."
33552,Raj,"well, you’re kidding, right?"
30626,Raj,"howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but i said no, our sheldon would say hokum."
32311,Raj,like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
29790,Raj,what about leslie winkle.
31163,Raj,you know who i blame for my loneliness? the united states of america. your movies and your tv shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
31869,Raj,"oh. i always thought, if i had a white name, it would be gavin."
29585,Raj,why did you do that?
30310,Raj,"excuse me, i have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. you’re just a douche."
30354,Raj,"okay, how’s that?"
31867,Raj,"she said she recently went on a date with a guy named roger? and he’s indian? and he’s an astrophysicist, too?"
30826,Raj,i don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
33712,Raj,"well, i’m glad to see you moving forward."
32991,Raj,"very well, thank you."
29681,Raj,good story.  
31444,Raj,"oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when leonard and i took howard to las vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. of all the howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite!"
21793,Raj,cool. can it break mach 1?
30968,Raj,i’m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend sanjay.
29584,Raj,the little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
32858,Raj,"oh, so kind of like what’s happening with penny right now."
30106,Raj,"he just went colon, capital o."
32995,Raj,"but, daddy, i, i miss my family so much, and with you and mummy getting a divorce, i feel sad and empty. buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. so while i can’t hug you every day, flying that helicopter…"
29928,Raj,he’s depressed because he’s pathetic and creepy and he can’t get girls.
30409,Raj,"okay, let’s check out the females."
33874,Raj,just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that i’m spoiled.
34121,Raj,you are my heart!
29827,Raj,"oh, you’re welcome. of course, i couldn’t get you into the vip section, because, you know, that’s for vips, and you guys are just, you know, ps."
33126,Raj,"ooh, ooh, i forgot about princess bride. that’s my answer."
30698,Raj,"hey, sheldon?"
29739,Raj,"ah yes, dr patel, good man."
31167,Raj,hi.
32563,Raj,250 million years.
31778,Raj,"but, howard…"
30864,Raj,so it spells sheldon?
34077,Raj,"like, really, a million?"
33898,Raj,"that’s a penguin i sponsor. they’re losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so i felt bad."
33430,Raj,hello.
33130,Raj,my name is little orphan annie. you killed my father. prepare to die.
32542,Raj,she feeds him out of her own mouth?
30842,Raj,first day of cricket camp. they drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
32535,Raj,thanks for the lift.
29918,Raj,she knows you. she’s tense. we all are. buy a basket!
31785,Raj,except on a date with anybody.
30376,Raj,foamy vengeance.
29828,Raj,"okay, so, saturday night, can i count on my posse?"
29992,Raj,"come on. when you were on tv in firefly, you were actually in space."
29808,Raj,it’s a lease.
32375,Raj,i can’t tell you that. but perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
31431,Raj,he got us again.
33987,Raj,i don’t want to speak for leonard.
30567,Raj,look at this. do you think she’s really doing that or is it photoshop?
32175,Raj,i’m just being a good house guest.
33947,Raj,thank you. i appreciate that.
33334,Raj,but i just broke up with my girlfriend.
31676,Raj,not that i can think of.
32902,Raj,"okay, i’ll start heating some of this stuff up."
29870,Raj,"or possibly durham, north carolina."
32992,Raj,"if you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn’t have to ask."
29593,Raj,what?
31286,Raj,"yeah, you’re right, that’s too personal. we hardly know each other. how about a cup of coffee?"
34180,Raj,hello.
32796,Raj,you saw her. she looks like jim carrey from dumb and dumber.
33348,Raj,"well, he could bring the baby here."
29997,Raj,what am i looking at?
32741,Raj,there’s been a problem with an experiment. a bird got into the clean room.
30043,Raj,"why, yes, i love to party. party is my middle name. or it would be, if it weren’t ramayan."
30108,Raj,i like the new look.
30262,Raj,"saturday night at the comic book store, they’re having a mystic warlords of ka-ah tournament. first prize is five hundred dollars. if we team up, we’d be unstoppable."
31214,Raj,then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
30521,Raj,"yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. it turned brown while you were talking."
30674,Raj,it’s one of his best moves.
31177,Raj,you’re making me sound like a caveman.
31279,Raj,you were in the middle of an erection.
30089,Raj,"me, too."
31930,Raj,don’t be silly. just tell him.
31537,Raj,"wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?"
31447,Raj,"oh, oh, don’t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and howard. there was about 200 pounds of sailor moon between us."
32883,Raj,"okay, where should i put them?"
30898,Raj,"yeah, i’m right here, buddy. how are you?"
29673,Raj,"you started it, dude. "
33548,Raj,"i just read a book about oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off.  there he is, there’s my happy hebraic homeboy. yeah, that’s the smile i’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and i’m living with your wife."
30006,Raj,you get to choose between a mountain bike or a ps3.
31506,Raj,what are you drinking?
31606,Raj,"hold on, hold on."
33358,Raj,"groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. tell me this isn’t like the best episode of sex and the city."
31570,Raj,"because when i use my regular voice, i feel like i’m making fun of them."
31736,Raj,"of course you have. they’re an engineer’s dream. anything you can design, a 3-d printer can make out of plastic."
32586,Raj,"ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?"
29696,Raj,what did they give you?
32494,Raj,"uh, this is my friend, sheldon. sheldon, this is emily."
32271,Raj,i thought you were a badass.
33583,Raj,"well, not now."
32498,Raj,uh-huh.
30544,Raj,"i’m just asking, dude. it happens."
30189,Raj,"oh, beef, i’m going to miss you so much. do you know, at the mumbai mcdonald’s, you can’t get a big mac? all you can get is a chicken maharaja mac. and the special sauce, curry, which, in india,"
33876,Raj,but bernadette makes more money than howard. she basically supports him.
32169,Raj,"hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did i tell you how to fix it? no. i said, aw, that must hurt, and i rubbed your belly."
30834,Raj,"no, uh-uh, you’re going down!"
31623,Raj,that’s good quality video.
31430,Raj,"okay, uh, i’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck i’ve always dreamed of having."
33001,Raj,what?
32847,Raj,what? i don’t need science to win her heart. i have my family’s wealth for that.
30775,Raj,what… what kind of a kiss?
30299,Raj,"i’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still friends?"
30705,Raj,"two words, deaf chick. it doesn’t matter if i can’t talk, because she can’t hear me."
32833,Raj,thanks.
29981,Raj,"it’s not so bad, really. at least these trains have modern plumbing. in india, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of rajasthan."
32925,Raj,the guy who invented it says it’s jif.
31409,Raj,because this one wants to marry me. i might never find another one who does.
34029,Raj,"you know who’s a super-ager? jennifer lopez. like, what is her secret?"
33550,Raj,he gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to howard.
30853,Raj,"ooh, i call kermit."
32054,Raj,"almost. oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?"
29642,Raj,somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube. 
30836,Raj,you’re wrong. it’s only a matter of time before you fall into rat-man’s rat trap.
32483,Raj,but after the cantina scene.
33125,Raj,"yeah, i’m here because i think it’s gonna be like game of thrones."
30499,Raj,"no, no, no, the sixth season is great. we go to paris with carrie and get our heart broken, and then mr. big shows up, we don’t know if we can trust him again. it’s a wild ride."
31798,Raj,i was humiliated by yet another woman.
31387,Raj,and this is howard.
32801,Raj,"all right, guys, what game do you want to play?"
33426,Raj,well this is kind of anti-climactic.
32085,Raj,why is that great news?
31950,Raj,"actually, i was thinking leonard."
33152,Raj,you sure? it’s a pretty great wall.
31008,Raj,none taken. you should hear how she talks about you.
31806,Raj,"you’re, you’re a good friend for trying to help, but, i’ve made my choice."
29862,Raj,brisket party! b-to-the-r-to-the-i-s-k… to-the-e-to-the-t… ooh…
32300,Raj,"and i just want you to know, i’m happy to look in on bernadette while you’re gone."
32546,Raj,it wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone.
29535,Raj,"oooh, he’s got me."
33576,Raj,"wow, it’s so cute."
30945,Raj,"is the trick making him disappear? sure, let’s see it."
31168,Raj,does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
31530,Raj,i’m in her head. let the dance begin.
32996,Raj,"just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?"
31536,Raj,"oh, uh, come in, come in. oh, i, uh, i didn’t think i was going to get to see you until tomorrow."
33218,Raj,wait. you’re sure they’re star wars tickets?
29999,Raj,knight to queen’s bishop-five.
31918,Raj,"not that it’s up to you to make me happy. uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. in which case, you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet."
33499,Raj,"yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great claire is."
32208,Raj,"yeah, but why are you fat?"
32745,Raj,should have put it in the bag first.
31577,Raj,it’ll be okay.
29780,Raj,terrific. 
30423,Raj,my incredible hulk hands signed by stan lee.
31674,Raj,that was before penny. i make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. i’m very old-fashioned that way.
30373,Raj,"i didn’t come to help, i came to mock."
31482,Raj,you should go to my girl. she’ll knock out those sideburns for free.
29948,Raj,he almost made it to the top this time.
31903,Raj,"yes. also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it."
32152,Raj,"hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious."
32639,Raj,"oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time."
32161,Raj,hmm. wonder what she sees in leonard.
30634,Raj,"you know, there’s something i’ve always wondered about aquaman."
30990,Raj,is something going on with him and bernadette?
29759,Raj,sure. tell us again how you screwed up and got penny back together with her old boyfriend.
33186,Raj,"you know, this reminds me of high school."
33902,Raj,"i can’t believe penny’s gonna get to go, and i’m not."
30246,Raj,"what do you want, sheldon?"
31783,Raj,"yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself."
30607,Raj,what?
33235,Raj,hello.
32396,Raj,"yes, rajesh koothrappali. look, uh, i just, i wanted to say i’m sorry. okay? you were, like, the coolest person i ever found online, and i got really nervous and i, i just blew it."
32058,Raj,"okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?"
30309,Raj,you’re impossible.
30588,Raj,did you get a japanese love pillow?
30477,Raj,"hold on. sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?"
32810,Raj,"just dandy, mr i-wish-i-was-better-at-improv."
31030,Raj,"i, uh, i guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down."
30031,Raj,"what happened with leslie, why did she dump you?"
29843,Raj,it’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
31561,Raj,it’s called being nice.
31535,Raj,"oh, my god, you’re back. oh, look at you. you, you look like you grew."
33443,Raj,you guys made a person.
31498,Raj,"i’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through, you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “i love you.” and that’s beautiful."
29796,Raj,sure.
32603,Raj,"hey, i read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking."
31434,Raj,you don’t want strippers? you’re the king of strippers. the one club in north hollywood named a pole after you.
32509,Raj,what do you mean?
31939,Raj,it was until i realized the screen had frozen. still one of my top three dates of all time.
29727,Raj,"more importantly, you’ve a darth vader voice changer? "
32555,Raj,"oh, well, her last name is sweeney, and something just didn’t seem right about koothrapeeney."
31963,Raj,"oh, please?"
31646,Raj,"what about you, sheldon? do you have any plans tonight?"
32253,Raj,"hey, since sheldon’s not going to comic-con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as."
32444,Raj,get it? because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
31096,Raj,"well, that seems fair."
31326,Raj,gamma.
34175,Raj,what fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? sending a flag up a pole on a hoist. 
30789,Raj,"he’s right. let’s make fun of his mother. howard, come rub my feet! my corns are killing me!"
30100,Raj,"yeah, it was first come, first served."
33982,Raj,"now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures. well?"
29898,Raj,"well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet."
30215,Raj,i’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
30715,Raj,"dude, that’s my sister you’re talking about."
29716,Raj,twice a month.
30630,Raj,you don’t know we’re wrong yet.
31002,Raj,"i just felt like drinking alone, because i’m deep and dark."
33833,Raj,you’re such a child.
32927,Raj,"you know me. i’m from india. i can’t resist children begging. so, how’s it going with the title to the house?"
32096,Raj,"well, you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you."
30128,Raj,how do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
34106,Raj,stairwell.
32011,Raj,why are you on a diet?
30699,Raj,no. see what i did there? i turned it around.
30012,Raj,the wolowitz coefficient?
33449,Raj,"man, i’m worn out."
29964,Raj,"yeah, you’re like the jar jar binks of the hofstadter family."
30986,Raj,"hello, mummy. hello, daddy. how are you?"
32702,Raj,"anyway, any ideas on a gift?"
33889,Raj,"i have come to an important decision. i will not be accepting your money any more. i’m a man, and i can take care of myself."
30339,Raj,we did it. we have the west coast feed of hbo.
32489,Raj,so she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.
30892,Raj,i say okey-dokey.
31345,Raj,yeah.
31229,Raj,i don’t know. maybe.
30070,Raj,you mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?
32623,Raj,"that’s nothing, dude. go check out how hung florida is."
31584,Raj,he probably just goes to the bathroom.
32010,Raj,"hey, what’s your problem?"
31846,Raj,"well, i believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure."
32073,Raj,"i know. what started as a pap smear turned into a date. which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. two-eyed cyclops."
32266,Raj,"yeah, me, too."
34008,Raj,he took the day off.
32290,Raj,moo-stache.
32935,Raj,you’re in a beatles cover band and you need howard to replace your dad as ringo.
30488,Raj,"look, let’s be reasonable. we all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and i want a jet ski."
32191,Raj,if you were having sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?
30160,Raj,so what do you gals do?
31116,Raj,"yes, i am. the god kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love."
33410,Raj,"i hear what you’re saying, but i’ve known emily a long time, and i think she deserves the benefit of the doubt."
31235,Raj,this is not a safe place. you can’t share anything here.
33196,Raj,"so, listen to what he wrote. uh, i saw you play at the comic book store. you guys rock. and then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this."
31212,Raj,wow. you’re not only our first astronaut. you’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. you’re like a rock star.
33051,Raj,i can’t believe you made out with mandy chao.
32951,Raj,"huh, what does that make us?"
33773,Raj,"she’s tired, that was funny."
32414,Raj,"you look, you look really pretty tonight."
32190,Raj,"you know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones."
29668,Raj,"okay, uh, how about her? "
30115,Raj,i was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
33819,Raj,"would you stop writing? wait, so, did all of you go on to better relationships after me?"
31557,Raj,i was thinking of dressing up as indiana jones’ mocha-skinned love child. indian jones.
31249,Raj,incredibly so.
33659,Raj,"oh, please, allow me. that’s a lot of empty calories."
30219,Raj,wha… you’re kidding!
31690,Raj,"oh, my god. you’re loving this."
32651,Raj,how hot is it?
30374,Raj,"that’s true. he didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. he, he broke out and poisoned gotham’s water supply."
30159,Raj,that sounds really cool.
33364,Raj,he’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. maybe we could get him a fossil.
30650,Raj,"don’t ruin it for me, man. i printed out a pdf to read on the potty."
31765,Raj,"okay, i guess."
33286,Raj,"you know, sheldon…"
32706,Raj,"uh, that was my dad on the phone. he moved out."
33174,Raj,thirty seconds.
32517,Raj,it’s okay.
30701,Raj,"well, we’ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles."
33228,Raj,"is it bad? did you hear something? oh, my god. it’s bad. somebody kill me."
32476,Raj,"you know, i heard of this way of watching the movies called the machete order, where you watch episodes iv and v, then skip episode i, watch ii and iii as a flashback, and then finish with vi."
30590,Raj,hi.
32245,Raj,"oh, it all comes down to this."
32170,Raj,all i’m saying is there’s a time to just listen. 
34096,Raj,"wait, wait, that’s my mummy and daddy calling from india. i want you to meet my parents."
30603,Raj,"it’s not like that, i’m watching someone’s tv. the good wife is on. i tell you, this is my new grey’s anatomy."
32750,Raj,"no, you’re the one who let him in."
29580,Raj,"no, no, not like haroun and tanweer."
32980,Raj,"well, i think we should show what earthlings look like."
32024,Raj,"a little loud, dude."
33378,Raj,wow. it’s an antique sextant. sailors used these to find their position by the stars.
32323,Raj,i was there. it was funny.
32495,Raj,are you here alone?
31990,Raj,all right.
31104,Raj,"well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment."
32968,Raj,"we, we can totally do that."
33763,Raj,"oh, great, now i can say things like i can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? yes, i’ll still help you move."
29618,Raj,"so you’re a dental student? hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you’re still winning. "
32648,Raj,"or totally naked. i love howard, but the dude needs a little shame."
33752,Raj,you were supposed to keep that to yourself.
32334,Raj,"i know. powerful stuff, huh?"
32967,Raj,"ooh. ooh, ooh. we could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium."
31581,Raj,wow. an end of an era.
30894,Raj,uh-huh.
29599,Raj,"how can i call her, you know i can’t talk to women. "
33824,Raj,maybe i won’t settle down. maybe i’ll just play the field.
30782,Raj,"dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?"
33305,Raj,just to help her with her screenplay.
33304,Raj,i do. i just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.
33991,Raj,"guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets sheldon."
32934,Raj,"a kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?"
30936,Raj,all the more shame that will fall upon the house of hofstadter.
33263,Raj,that is a great idea.
33461,Raj,"hey, did i say something to upset you?"
33926,Raj,"oh, my god, that’s so generous."
33335,Raj,please take me back. our love was meant to be.
33685,Raj,i think you’re very nice as well.
33919,Raj,"this is so generous of you, i, um, i don’t know what to say."
30731,Raj,dude! i put that thing on my face!
33153,Raj,i’m sorry. i did what i could.
32667,Raj,"if you would just use the bucket, you’d be so much more comfortable."
33901,Raj,"okay, sheldon. yeah, i’m putting you in charge of my finances. i will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize."
32807,Raj,"yes, emily. whatever. where’s sheldon?"
33497,Raj,"hey, dude, you’re killing me with claire."
30948,Raj,october sixth.
33511,Raj,you sure?
29730,Raj,"i can and i did, look up dibs on wikipedia."
31946,Raj,"okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?"
30732,Raj,that was all a lie? this year’s gifts are already wrapped!
30758,Raj,what’s in the bag?
31995,Raj,"so if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable."
32579,Raj,"hey, guys."
34134,Raj,no!
30202,Raj,"it’s a little early, isn’t it?"
30595,Raj,i bought a parrot.
32697,Raj,that’s howard’s cousin that he had sex with.
29644,Raj,"oh, too bad. i’ve always wanted to go to long beach. "
31262,Raj,"that sounds amazing. first movie i’m watching, annie."
31223,Raj,"i didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow i feel better."
30810,Raj,"oh. well, that’s disappointing."
31157,Raj,sorry. better?
30684,Raj,can you say it again for me?
33569,Raj,"oh, i know, why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?"
34187,Raj,"have her get season two. season one, it was still finding itself."
30872,Raj,what do you think we should sell it for?
31128,Raj,"aw, there’s a thing."
31617,Raj,"ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt."
31926,Raj,that’s great.
32913,Raj,"oh, yeah? i love ping-pong."
30479,Raj,who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
29855,Raj,i have a better idea.
33404,Raj,"no, no. please don’t cry."
30750,Raj,"i love this country! the-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! from california to the new york island, i’m a real yankee doodle boy!"
29836,Raj,"i know, i am resplendent like the noonday sun, am i not?"
33718,Raj,i think you’re both cute.
29900,Raj,can i see your stitches?
31941,Raj,"hey, don’t discourage him. this is a fantastic opportunity."
30148,Raj,"no, i’m behind on my wiki-reading i’m kind of on a john grisham kick right now."
33118,Raj,with pleasure.
32033,Raj,"okay, everybody. who’s ready for a scavenger hunt?  each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. the first team that finds it wins."
31439,Raj,does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?
29703,Raj,three.
30287,Raj,see what?
30874,Raj,"i’ll tell you one thing. if i get rich enough, that’s the kind of girl i want to take on a submarine ride. and yes, that time, i meant it to be dirty."
31871,Raj,"no, this is creepy."
33007,Raj,"all i know, mummy, is that he’s a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there’s no money for your little boy."
29604,Raj,"great, then we’ll get married, i won’t be able to talk to her, and we’ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence. "
29747,Raj,"i am shiva the destroyer, i will have the woman! "
33723,Raj,"so, i was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant cpr class."
31850,Raj,"and i will return to new delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. and you know what will be on that elephant’s back? a seat warmer. no, father, you may not have a ride."
33403,Raj,"hey, emily, listen, i’ve been thinking, and i’m not sure it’s a good idea that i come over."
32918,Raj,so did i.
32760,Raj,"well, that’s that. the room’s compromised. they’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks."
31935,Raj,"okay, if i upset you, then why didn’t you just say something?"
33812,Raj,"uh, next?"
33559,Raj,"so, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?"
32035,Raj,"okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two."
31573,Raj,"sheldon, you okay?"
31384,Raj,"oh, no, no, i get a say in it. but i’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome i’ve been having with aunt jemima and mrs butterworth."
33846,Raj,"yeah, great. um, i’ll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom."
32923,Raj,you’re wrong.
33665,Raj,what? what are you talking about?
31923,Raj,what else?
31473,Raj,peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
29878,Raj,"i’ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?"
32121,Raj,"there are just some things that i feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my koothrapanties are in a bunch."
31017,Raj,the lonely guy and the two happy couples? i’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
29559,Raj,"oh, that’s very impressive. and a little racist. "
30903,Raj,what?
29717,Raj,"okay, every other month."
30498,Raj,"there are six seasons, dude."
30627,Raj,"okay, how about this. even spock had a date once every seven years."
30406,Raj,"yeah, well i do. and when my wingman is carrying a green lantern lantern, i drink a lot. i’ll have a screwdriver, please. don’t be chintzy with the screw."
29762,Raj,"dude, she said she wants to slow things down."
30010,Raj,we went to the comic book store last night.
33941,Raj,"you’re right, i am humiliated. thanks for pointing it out. you’re such a jerk."
34038,Raj,"well, he is much more attractive than leonard."
29877,Raj,simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.
32774,Raj,i know.
31443,Raj,"i’m not done, but thank you.  i think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. i told him i’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin."
32556,Raj,i don’t understand. why is it bad that you have to teach?
29954,Raj,"yep, i don’t see any way around it."
33205,Raj,"he is so cool. hey, no hard feelings, but i’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him."
32879,Raj,with what?
33519,Raj,you can’t ignore it. it’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.
30508,Raj,"yeah, meemaw did the nasty."
33392,Raj,"well, anyway, i’ll leave you to your girls’ night."
32381,Raj,correct.
33386,Raj,hello?
32752,Raj,"uh, you have to take the pin out."
29594,Raj,"okay, i know what i’m going to do."
31512,Raj,oh. something about latin music just makes me feel like i’m on a white sand beach in rio.
31438,Raj,"may i have your attention, please? we are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend howard wolowitz."
30672,Raj,"oh, you’re so arrogant. if you were a superhero, your name would be captain arrogant. and you know what your superpower would be? arrogance."
33963,Raj,"you know, downward-facing dog comes from the sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana."
33146,Raj,"hmm. i’m doing okay, and i was very popular at 13."
33056,Raj,i bet you told bernadette all about how he was screwing around with mandy chao.
32206,Raj,"you’d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you’d try to fill the void with food, and i’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake."
32898,Raj,it’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.
30706,Raj,that’s what she said.
30256,Raj,"hey, how come i wasn’t part of this deal?"
29788,Raj,n-n-n-nothing happened to me.
30086,Raj,"but if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program."
32176,Raj,"oh, come on, i brought you one, too."
29550,Raj,"okay, if no-one else will say it, i will. we really suck at paintball."
30922,Raj,you heard me. i forbidded it.
32051,Raj,"well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. i just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. all right, here we go, and smile. okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. how about this? turn away, and then turn back into it. but when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet."
32926,Raj,"hey, i got you a little gift."
33872,Raj,"thank you, penny."
33406,Raj,i don’t think so. she sounded pretty upset.
31531,Raj,howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
33266,Raj,but it’s beautiful.
31681,Raj,it’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
34082,Raj,whatever.
33532,Raj,address?
32969,Raj,this is great.
31160,Raj,mmmmmm.
29784,Raj,"by moving on, do you mean, she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with wolowitz?"
31425,Raj,"well, don’t be too mean."
30425,Raj,you can’t wear the hands on the date.
29971,Raj,"well, that’s it then, we’re doomed."
32786,Raj,so?
29907,Raj,"it’s true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater."
30437,Raj,screw you. give me back my lima beans.
33376,Raj,"well, she was pretty mad. for all i know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk."
30422,Raj,"please, sheldon, i’m a lost indian boy far from home, and i want a girlfriend and i want her to be abby, and she’ll only come over if she can bring martha."
33143,Raj,i have that same underwear.
32948,Raj,"i would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. they would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around."
31495,Raj,"oh pish on your issues. you guys are fine. yes, you hit some bumps along the way. i mean, penny, you’ve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection."
31188,Raj,"it’s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that w-shaped constellation is cassiopeia. and she was the mother of andromeda who’s over there."
30067,Raj,"i’m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny."
31027,Raj,"oh, cool. can i play?"
33034,Raj,"well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?"
33684,Raj,"yeah, sure. i understand. yeah, i’m very busy, too."
31742,Raj,"ooh, i, i think it’s done. oh, it worked. we printed a whistle."
30276,Raj,"well, if wil wheaton and stuart win their match and we beat lonely larry and captain sweatpants in the next round, we’ll face off for the championship."
29767,Raj,he was a lot more fun when he had no hope. 
29922,Raj,"man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that."
29552,Raj,"or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. "
32134,Raj,"can i ask you guys a question? so, i’m seeing lucy tomorrow night, and i’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. how do you do it?"
33611,Raj,i’ve never been to palm springs.
32709,Raj,how can i be okay? i come from a broken home.
30307,Raj,"and you do it all the time. last week in the mall at radio shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and i suddenly realize you’re not even there."
32808,Raj,"wow, if he cracks that it’s a game changer, guys. it’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe."
33721,Raj,"okay, cool."
30359,Raj,right! that was so good! sweety and meaty at the same time.
30041,Raj,rajesh ramayan koothrappali.
31016,Raj,"mmm, greek food on pizza night? this is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to sheldon since we left that fake message from stephen hawking on his voice mail."
29645,Raj,sounds fun.
32042,Raj,"oh, yes, leonard. yes, it was."
31039,Raj,"forgive me for staring, but you’re very beautiful."
29683,Raj,i like it.
33094,Raj,really?
32497,Raj,"yeah, okay."
32475,Raj,"ugh, let’s get this over with."
29654,Raj,"no way, jose. "
32239,Raj,yes. arlene. she wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.
32655,Raj,do you know any mining songs?
32071,Raj,like a hero.
31285,Raj,are you single?
33070,Raj,"yeah, nothing’s been changed since he drove it."
32784,Raj,why?
32457,Raj,"okay. so, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. we’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish."
32615,Raj,"boy, when you met bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit."
31957,Raj,"don’t call her my girlfriend. we haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. now that it’s out there, are you my girlfriend? by the way, if you say no, i’ll never be happy again. not to put you on the spot."
33176,Raj,"five, four, three, two, one. that’s too bad."
31269,Raj,"oh, me, too. you’re so caring. i’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood."
32393,Raj,and it’s done.
30500,Raj,"okay, everybody, and plie. and relevae."
31023,Raj,"well, not so much depressed as lonely."
31448,Raj,"you know, we’re not that far from my apartment. if you stop the car, i can walk from here."
30846,Raj,the archies are over here.
32792,Raj,like what?
33934,Raj,"one second. okay, i think we’re close. how do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?"
30484,Raj,your guy eddie crispo?
29802,Raj,she’s so considerate.
31625,Raj,"oh, my god, here he comes. this is it."
31830,Raj,i’m counting that as foreplay.
31452,Raj,i’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from comic-con.
31182,Raj,you’re right. everyone loves music.
32658,Raj,okay. how ’bout a little miley cyrus next?
32859,Raj,"uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?"
31796,Raj,"i go to the bathroom, too. sometimes more frequently than i care to admit. oh, i’ve had it checked out, it’s nothing. hmm. this is going great. mmm, can i have a refill on my chai tea? yes, i have a good feeling about this.  i should have bought condoms."
32282,Raj,thank you.
31184,Raj,"yes, but she doesn’t. so get signing, hand monkey."
31304,Raj,"can i pour you some wine? i think you’ll enjoy it. the traditional choice with peking duck is a sauvignon blanc, but siri suggested an off-dry riesling. i wasn’t sure, but i didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of trader joe’s. now, what should we put siri in for dinner? leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase coco chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. siri, play some smooth jazz."
31407,Raj,"look, howard, you’re in a relationship. you know you have to make compromises."
32062,Raj,"oh, cool, it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. jenny309. i hope that’s not her weight. "
33496,Raj,we’re just keeping it casual.
31334,Raj,hmm. i’m gonna give you the same advice i yell at the tv when the bachelor’s handing out roses. follow your heart.
29818,Raj,i didn’t even know there was a president’s dining room.
33828,Raj,"well, i want to make sure we get invited to all the parades. "
32195,Raj,sounds about right.
34005,Raj,does this place look familiar?
33243,Raj,"fine, you want something to do? there’s about six months of data on this hard drive. why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies."
30998,Raj,what?
33328,Raj,"you mean the strong, sexy angel i can’t stop thinking about? who can say?"
31486,Raj,"my pleasure. waiter? a bottle of champagne and three glasses. oh, boy, isn’t this romantic?"
30840,Raj,what the hell did i do?
34047,Raj,congratulations.
30289,Raj,"come on, scissors, scissors!"
33905,Raj,"well, so? so you think bernadette’s just gonna let you jet down to san diego for five days and leave her alone?"
33107,Raj,just be honest. you don’t like it.
31404,Raj,"we hit a couple of bumps. she lives over on manhattan beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. and she’s a lesbian."
31777,Raj,"oh, my god. she’s not gonna bathe me, is she?"
30995,Raj,so what’s up?
31931,Raj,"uh, yeah, sorry. she’s just a little shy. the first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me."
32635,Raj,"hey, sheldon, you busy?"
33628,Raj,you coming?
30742,Raj,"it doesn’t matter. they’ll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to gandhi-ville. by the way, when i say that, it’s not offensive."
32707,Raj,"no, it’s fine. it’s not that big a deal. as long as they’re happy, i’m happy. and when i get to see them for the holidays, i’ll get to celebrate diwali twice, one at each house. that’s double the diwali."
33444,Raj,and i like to think i helped.
29946,Raj,damn it. i had lysine and changed it.
33048,Raj,i’m sure you guys will figure something out.
32860,Raj,"ooh. okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear."
31471,Raj,"right now, howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny jewish greek god. zeusowitz."
33016,Raj,really? i don’t know where she’d get an idea like that. you know mummy and her crazy imagination i’m so lucky i take after you.
32584,Raj,"so, we’d be, like, owners of a comic book store?"
30543,Raj,"did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?"
32363,Raj,stuart?
30586,Raj,she won’t notice they’re missing?
32897,Raj,"of course. i know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. my uncle was a worshipper of krishna. but after he died, you know what we found? a statue of shiva. it may not be crips and bloods, okay? but in india, it’s a thing."
33703,Raj,it’s my one move.
31717,Raj,"it, it is. it’s not just comic books. they’ve got action figures, toys, a tron-themed dance party."
33055,Raj,hang on. what do i need to do to make you trust me?
31710,Raj,"now let’s do some sexy glamour shots. i’ll set the mood.  oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. that’s right. oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz…"
32379,Raj,"no, i was svelte as a gazelle. a gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling."
29638,Raj,go for stereo. 
33952,Raj,thank you.
29865,Raj,"that isn’t klingon, it’s yiddish for meat-filled dumpling."
30259,Raj,"it’s true. i’ve seen him at the beach, he’s like a human chicken wing."
32954,Raj,i don’t know. how do you want to start?
33137,Raj,what are you guys up to?
32257,Raj,"i’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. what if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?"
33475,Raj,"hey, you think it’d be okay if i brought claire to the wine tasting?"
33920,Raj,"as much as i appreciate this, i can’t accept it, okay? halley’s my goddaughter, i don’t take care of her for money."
30323,Raj,what a douche.
30687,Raj,"that’s for me, ramon, julio, jesus and rodrigo to know and you to find out."
32407,Raj,what am i supposed to do? how am i supposed to choose between emily and lucy?
32526,Raj,"what up, guys?"
32003,Raj,good night.
29592,Raj,"excuse me, hello? my parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am i going to do?"
30293,Raj,if she gave you any look at l. it was a you suck look.
32232,Raj,and does sheldon know you’re dating sheldon?
30568,Raj,you don’t know that. prison changes people.
33527,Raj,"oh, no."
31525,Raj,"in case you didn’t follow that, i’m the coffee."
31866,Raj,"i was googling that girl i’ve been dating, and i found her blog."
29553,Raj,"what? just because i’m indian i can’t be a norse god? no, no, no, raj has to be an indian god. that’s racism. i mean, look at wolowitz, he’s not english, but he’s dressed like peter pan. sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he’s obviously the doppler effect. "
30685,Raj,one more time?
29619,Raj,"hey guys. this is lalita gupta, lalita this is leonard and sheldon and howard and penny. isn’t it great, she isn’t fat any more! "
31090,Raj,"okay, deal."
34081,Raj,no. i haven’t played the race card yet.
31822,Raj,"anyway, i was hoping i could, uh, pick your brains a little. i’m supposed to take lucy out friday and i need a killer first date."
30135,Raj,"ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken."
32582,Raj,i told you she exists.
30141,Raj,holy crap. it’s like silence of the lambs down here.  don’t do that!
32866,Raj,"but remember our agreement? you can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding."
29526,Raj,smooth.
30790,Raj,"hello, hawaii. this is dr. koothrappali in pasadena. i’d like you to reposition the telescope, please. scarlett johansson’s house! i’m kidding, hawaii. mahalo. whoo!"
33008,Raj,"thank you, mummy, i love you. helicopters for everybody."
32148,Raj,wow. you’re even prettier than penny said. i can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend.
30860,Raj,i think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
30708,Raj,"oh, leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free."
30386,Raj,"well, then what are we going to do tonight?"
32488,Raj,do you know how to set it up?
30889,Raj,"dude, that’s incredible!"
32837,Raj,"wait, hang on. if you’re really nathan fillion, what’s the line from firefly about your bonnet?"
31671,Raj,"no, it’s not. she was too beautiful for me."
32638,Raj,"it’s also a live mine, so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance."
33435,Raj,"please, bernadette. let me leave with my dignity."
31516,Raj,"do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?"
32947,Raj,hey. thanks for coming by.
31999,Raj,"oh, yes, i, i too am in the throes of heartbreak. okay, fine, i’ll tell you about it."
31372,Raj,"alright, uh, fine, i’m coming and i’m bringing somebody. uh, koothrappali plus one."
29794,Raj,"i bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it.  and he told me his name was kimberley!"
30677,Raj,but i can’t have one.
33911,Raj,i’m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores i could do.
31968,Raj,excuse me.
33470,Raj,"you know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life game of thrones."
31733,Raj,"it’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them.  he’s right, dawg."
31134,Raj,i did. it was beautiful.
33689,Raj,"oh, well, you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner, so i thought we could have one right here."
31389,Raj,"well, i hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake."
30024,Raj,barkeep! alexander me.
32248,Raj,anyone in?
31542,Raj,which part?
29711,Raj,"if my fingers ever work again, i’ve got a job for the middle one. "
31299,Raj,it’s just a phone.
33720,Raj,"do, uh, howard and bernadette know? or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?"
29811,Raj,"boy, i bet ellen pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap."
31169,Raj,"okay, i’m going to play it cool. tell her, maybe. whatever, babe."
33610,Raj,what time do you and bernadette head out?
32609,Raj,hey.
31982,Raj,"well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good."
30029,Raj,are you spock?
30969,Raj,what else do we know about him?
30469,Raj,"hey, i didn’t even mention dum dum dugan or green goblin, matt murdock, pepper potts, victor von doom, oh, and worst of all, millie the model."
33737,Raj,just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.
31748,Raj,aren’t you gonna eat lunch?
32690,Raj,hey.
31969,Raj,hang on.
29848,Raj,"just making conversation. mummy, daddy, i want you to meet my new squeeze, penny."
32618,Raj,i’ll make the popcorn.
32288,Raj,you mean a moo-stache?
32512,Raj,i’ll stick with eleven. she liked howard better.
32056,Raj,"come on, dude, you’re being too hard on yourself. you’ve got a lot of good stuff going on."
32484,Raj,"hey, we can say it. you can’t."
30980,Raj,it’s a re-writable cd. just put it in.
29738,Raj,"so, missy. have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of india? "
31273,Raj,did you forget what penny did to you? it took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
33533,Raj,"um, no. "
30432,Raj,there are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
33677,Raj,"oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair."
31951,Raj,"you are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your woody allen swagger."
32143,Raj,"well, and i ate all the crumb cake. we both made mistakes."
31191,Raj,i was so smooth on that date.
32339,Raj,teams are fun.
30724,Raj,on caprica night?
30582,Raj,i can’t believe they let him into canada.
31477,Raj,"oh, okay. sounds like it’s me and you, sheldon. how about we sic some guppies on those puppies?"
34097,Raj,"hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. i’m not drunk."
31887,Raj,"not brian boitano, that’s for sure. how’s your burrito?"
32110,Raj,"okay, let me have it. let’s hear all the raj is a girl jokes."
34131,Raj,"hey, look who decided to show up."
30436,Raj,"okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and i’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and i hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes."
33953,Raj,"well, didn’t think this is where my life would be."
33474,Raj,i would love to. i do enjoy the complexity of an aged pinot noir.
31335,Raj,follow your heart.
31856,Raj,unbelievable. you have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
32575,Raj,why would i lose friends just because i started dating someone?
34001,Raj,"yeah, it depends on the privacy settings."
30952,Raj,these cards have barcodes on them. the wand is a reader. it’s transmitting to your phone.
33588,Raj,i’m sorry?
32976,Raj,okay.
32607,Raj,we could go up to big bear and get a house on the lake.
33617,Raj,shall we toast?
29995,Raj,you got me. now what are you going to do with me?
33682,Raj,"that’s wonderful. a lawyer, my sister’s a lawyer. look at that, we have something in common."
33492,Raj,"hey, claire. good, you’re here. guys, this is my friend claire. we’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it."
32869,Raj,"oh, good."
30831,Raj,"wait. are we starting now? or is that what you’re going to say when we do start, or…"
30353,Raj,"the meteors don’t get here, the earth is moving into their path."
31375,Raj,i’m not telling. i’m from asia. i’m mysterious. deal with it.
30973,Raj,"me, too."
33189,Raj,"no, seriously. it’s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. it’s about, it’s about simply being."
33004,Raj,"well, i’ve been thinking about you. how are you doing? are you happy, mummy?"
32069,Raj,hello.
33904,Raj,"go ahead, make jokes. i don’t know why you think you’re going to comic-con, you just had a baby."
33095,Raj,what is it?
32527,Raj,and i thought me having sex with emily was gonna be the big news.
30908,Raj,or maybe he heard it’s tator tot tuesday. that’s why i’m here.
33031,Raj,"no, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard."
32841,Raj,that’s what i said when we moved it.
32541,Raj,like us?
32343,Raj,plane tickets? yeah.
33927,Raj,"i really appreciate it. uh, can you hold on one second? hey, so, howard, what’s the bathroom situation gonna be?"
29754,Raj,"keebler elf? i’ve got your keebler elf right here.  okay, it’s a stalemate. "
30162,Raj,"sure, we like fun."
33706,Raj,couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
30696,Raj,"well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, i’d say it’s spot-on."
30137,Raj,"ugh, toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?"
32912,Raj,"hey, penny, can you give me a hand with this?"
33880,Raj,my father pays for it. do you know how much your rent is?
31996,Raj,"uh, excuse me, mrs. davis?"
30553,Raj,"oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again."
29560,Raj,"we can split it two, two and two."
31800,Raj,i went and looked. it was a high and tiny window. she must have been very motivated.
29806,Raj,"it’s pretty cool, they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in indonesia, and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and ellen page, star of the charming independent film juno."
33018,Raj,how’d you do that?
33914,Raj,"oh, double stuffed oreos, i remember when i could afford you."
32132,Raj,you had to be taught not to burn down the forest?
33114,Raj,she has nothing to do with this. i am my own man.
31962,Raj,"a little one. it’s, it’s a farewell for leonard, so all the attention will be on him. if you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there."
31172,Raj,"oh, she’s here."
32610,Raj,why not?
33759,Raj,"well, you’re all thinking it, i’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile."
31673,Raj,"well, uh, there was a time when i had a thing for penny, and i thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. but apparently i misread those signals."
29693,Raj,hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
30737,Raj,yes.
31018,Raj,i have to feel sorry for myself. i’m the only one who cares. just like i’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.
31370,Raj,i can’t believe this is only 64 calories.
33092,Raj,"it’s been around for years. it’s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme."
33420,Raj,"interesting. i mean, it’s not testicles on a cryostat, but i like it."
32938,Raj,"all right, i’ve got your back."
33336,Raj,i’m gonna all alone on valentine’s day.
32838,Raj,"although, i knew the line, doesn’t make me nathan fillion."
31705,Raj,"you know, we’re not that far from vazquez rocks."
29895,Raj,during which she defected to north korea.
32329,Raj,"amy, i could use some help."
31015,Raj,you will?
31745,Raj,"oh, okay, great. now i can look like val kilmer as batman instead of val kilmer as he looks today."
33076,Raj,"perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness."
32001,Raj,"mrs. davis, i, uh, i must confess, i came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead i got to connect with you at a human level. that’s a much better evening. you’re a lovely person."
29853,Raj,over what?
34055,Raj,"i really can’t thank you enough for taking me in. you know, i was in a pretty low place in my life."
32285,Raj,oh. thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
33678,Raj,"uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?"
31511,Raj,sure. mmm. bossa nova. you listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.
32422,Raj,really? because i’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing i can say about myself.
29558,Raj,"oh, if only i had his confidence. i have such difficulty speaking to women. or around women. or at times, even effeminate men. "
32275,Raj,"thank you. oh, and i’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room."
34166,Raj,"ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby."
33246,Raj,"yeah, maybe that is something. how did you find that?"
33512,Raj,you’re right. you realize what this means?
32522,Raj,i don’t. i have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
30862,Raj,oh. very clever. but still racist.
31922,Raj,i like your bangs.
30792,Raj,"it is. if you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you."
32364,Raj,"well, it’s too late."
30867,Raj,what are you talking about?
31496,Raj,"now, don’t blame yourself. he was a groveller from way back. but the point is, the two of you got past it. and, leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? that was some weak tea, dude."
32973,Raj,"look, we admit it. the idea that you guys came up with was really good, and i’d love your help."
32369,Raj,thank you.
32296,Raj,"uh, off. and on. and the oprah network. this is so much better than watching tv like a muggle."
30772,Raj,we’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. there are no stupid questions.
30546,Raj,"yeah, i think we’re getting close."
30335,Raj,i didn’t ask you to set me up with lakshmi.
32151,Raj,it’s horrible. why would you push a cow over? they’re sacred.
33769,Raj,hello.
30142,Raj,"yeah, well, i don’t like bugs, okay? they freak me out."
31199,Raj,it’s okay. i can’t get mad at your feelings.
29770,Raj,did you take a band aid off in front of him? 
34113,Raj,"hey, those are my lima beans!"
32459,Raj,what do you mean?
30686,Raj,now three times fast?
31454,Raj,"well, that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there."
33746,Raj,don’t come to the hospital. we’re headed home.
30266,Raj,"leonard, help."
30653,Raj,potty is innocent. potty is adorable.
30757,Raj,hello.
32982,Raj,"oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?"
32093,Raj,"well, i’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. the sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. but boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition."
33325,Raj,hey.
33256,Raj,"yeah, it is. and you know we get to name it."
29695,Raj,holy crap. 
32350,Raj,what’s happening tomorrow night?
33578,Raj,"yeah, that’s not worrisome at all."
32218,Raj,no. no pretty girls. the point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
30490,Raj,i was afraid of that.  go ahead.
31272,Raj,what’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
31209,Raj,seriously? i’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?
31483,Raj,"you know, amy, i don’t even think you and i have had a real conversation. let’s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. you start."
30492,Raj,forget the jet skis? that was our line in the sand! what happened to “tear them a new one?”
33472,Raj,okay. but you using sheldon to do your dirty work is like when cersei used the king’s guard to do her bidding.
30591,Raj,i’m a big fan of your work.
33863,Raj,you did?
30345,Raj,"oh, menopause, nature’s birth control."
30639,Raj,"really? a robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk, dude. that’s funny, ask anyone."
32370,Raj,"actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves."
32712,Raj,better. i guess the news just hit me a lot harder than i expected.
33538,Raj,what are you talking about? they’ve always known where you live.
32284,Raj,she’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.
30993,Raj,"fair enough. now, what’s up with clarinet? bernadette!"
34016,Raj,that’s nice. i haven’t had much success meeting people online.
31815,Raj,"yeah, me neither."
33813,Raj,"okay, new rule, everybody only gets one. uh, next?"
32452,Raj,you’re a good friend. i owe you one.
32419,Raj,yeah.
33877,Raj,"oh, please. look in the mirror. you both look ten years older than i do."
33509,Raj,you can’t make me feel bad.
33753,Raj,you’re gonna have to be quieter than that.
29752,Raj,don’t start with me dude.
30871,Raj,"hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta."
30594,Raj,i’m not hungry.
30171,Raj,"very, very smart guys."
30506,Raj,you’re right. let’s talk about your grandmother.
30021,Raj,fine. i’ll have a chocolate martini.
31661,Raj,"my pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. just ask my dog. my vet says if i give her any more foie gras, she’s going to die of gout."
29710,Raj,sheldon?
32730,Raj,"you were his colleague. how did your research turn out? great. hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a nobel."
32147,Raj,"i love you, penny."
31368,Raj,"but e-excuse me, i have something to say. none of you may realize it, but i was very much looking forward to this weekend. it was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? even if i get one someday, i’ll still be the guy who got a girl after sheldon cooper!"
33649,Raj,that would be amazing.
30540,Raj,maybe that’s what they want to talk about.
32561,Raj,"ask why not again, i’ve got an answer."
32875,Raj,"well, there’s a question i better have a good answer to before she gets back."
33867,Raj,"yeah, i saw something for halley and i couldn’t resist."
32103,Raj,"actually, i’m busy."
32209,Raj,congrats.
33741,Raj,fine. what do one point three billion people know about having babies?
29719,Raj,"mrs bell was deaf, she’s not even going to hear you knock. "
31136,Raj,"oh, good. um, can i tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? kind of a candle in the wind deal?"
30383,Raj,"ha! eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber."
31993,Raj,"that’s so much better than the old, ugly ones."
29675,Raj,"forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?"
33786,Raj,"okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and i will mark them down. "
32278,Raj,"okay. okay, thank you. oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. she likes katy perry. oh, but don’t do firework, that gets her all riled up."
29628,Raj,"but he’s right, papa, listen to him.  you! you are the one who ruined everything! "
33252,Raj,a medium-sized asteroid.
33571,Raj,how can you be embarrassed around me? i’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.
30381,Raj,wow. looks like the ganges on laundry day.
31508,Raj,amen to that. sometimes i pour a little chardonnay into my dog’s water bowl.
31195,Raj,how dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
33616,Raj,here you go.
32761,Raj,"yeah, just leave me out of it. you know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the indian guy."
32580,Raj,"emily, you know almost everybody here."
32036,Raj,"oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt."
33299,Raj,excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.
33215,Raj,"eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?"
34002,Raj,"hang on, i can see every place you went."
29626,Raj,what just happened?
30272,Raj,"no doubt, sign here."
33827,Raj,"but theoretically, if you and i were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people? like, print up announcements?"
32142,Raj,"please, sit. i, uh, i got you a cappuccino. i remembered it was your favourite. i also got crumb cake, but i remembered it was my favourite and i ate it. anyway, uh, how are you?"
30290,Raj,"wait, what are you doing? i can’t scissors by myself! howard! come back!"
30207,Raj,"you know, he’s british, i’m indian, ever since gandhi they haven’t liked us very much."
31811,Raj,"uh, would you like to come in?"
33498,Raj,"i mean, come on, look at you. you’re classically handsome, you’ve got a swimmer’s body. next to you, i look like me."
30168,Raj,"with my luck, hepatitis"
33513,Raj,congratulations.
29602,Raj,"for what, making me sound like a simpsons character? "
31737,Raj,"oh, come on. you deserve one. you’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money."
30109,Raj,"i call it the mario and luigi, but whatever. hey, how’s sheldon doing?"
34178,Raj,hello.
29763,Raj,you being the fish.
32399,Raj,"and then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from india were exotic and mysterious. so, with my mouth, i said, we’re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, i said, straight up, red, hop on my flying carpet."
31034,Raj,i’m not sure. some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
33853,Raj,"oh, of course we can. uh, you girls have a good time. she said i was in charge."
31087,Raj,"oh, my god, she’s that mona? why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here?"
32465,Raj,"and i have to be honest, i thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it."
31731,Raj,this sucks.
31803,Raj,i don’t want to celebrate.
30956,Raj,so never.
32120,Raj,but this isn’t about the jewellery. this is about me having a place where i can open up about my feelings.
32554,Raj,"so, i’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and emily. what do you like better? emippali or koothrapemily?"
32153,Raj,i’m in.
31297,Raj,i’m sorry?
32420,Raj,"are you, are you sure? because this is the part of the night where i’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves."
32505,Raj,"to be truthful, emily and i haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other."
33463,Raj,"okay, i think i see what’s happening here. you’re jealous of me."
33514,Raj,open it.
32213,Raj,can we bring anything?
29694,Raj,"sheldon can suck on, the casimir effect."
33742,Raj,"i love you, too. we’re good."
31400,Raj,w-w-with women. i like to boogie with women.
31405,Raj,"well, you know whenever you and i would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. it’s like that. except this time it’s true."
33621,Raj,"actually, i’m single now."
30550,Raj,"i don’t know about you, but i feel empowered."
30055,Raj,with sex.
31364,Raj,"hey, i plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much."
30863,Raj,ooh. leonard’s going all alpha nerd on sheldon’s ass.
29609,Raj,"haven’t you been listening to me, i cannot talk to women."
31886,Raj,thanks. i love hockey.
31986,Raj,you would do that for me?
33269,Raj,"hey, stuart."
31696,Raj,how else am i supposed to talk to the human resources lady?
32565,Raj,"you suck, wolowitz."
32149,Raj,"i don’t believe you, you’re lying to me. "
30906,Raj,"yeah, okay, so, zombies."
31741,Raj,i think this thing was made in china.
32122,Raj,"yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt. "
31524,Raj,‘cause that’s what we do.
33955,Raj,wouldn’t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?
33821,Raj,"okay, maybe we should just end this."
33009,Raj,what’s the first one?
30088,Raj,"well, i’m a hindu. my religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. three months at the north pole with sheldon and i’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!"
33719,Raj,"hey, stuart. what are you doing here?"
30155,Raj,goth food.
30561,Raj,"well, i do. next to you, i’ll look like a catch."
29834,Raj,look at that. i got a date with penny. i can’t believe it took you a whole year.
31787,Raj,"oh, yeah, think about it. we’d hang out, we’d read comic books, we’d see movies. it’d be like the best relationship ever."
30096,Raj,he’s right.
31095,Raj,did you sign this?
31881,Raj,"uh, lucy’s coming over. i need some advice."
30398,Raj,"oh, boy."
32200,Raj,keep going. 
30018,Raj,"guys, have you seen stuart all up in penny’s business over there?"
29761,Raj,he’s coming. screen saver. 
31005,Raj,this was nice.
30408,Raj,he’ll have a shirley temple.
30598,Raj,"oh, this is like a nightmare. get lost!"
31290,Raj,you have a beautiful voice.
32896,Raj,"i promise. why, what’s in there?"
33896,Raj,are you serious?
30977,Raj,"hey, how about we stay the night and hit legoland in the morning?"
29603,Raj,i didn’t want to make this one.
32038,Raj,your next puzzle is a riddle. and who better to give it to you than the riddler?
33233,Raj,"uh, i’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. you’re more than welcome to join me."
32320,Raj,"while showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters."
32028,Raj,"no, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. so, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you."
31239,Raj,"still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. or a dolphin, i go back and forth."
31159,Raj,what kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
33592,Raj,"uh, pull over."
32958,Raj,"eh. although, to be fair, i watched e.t. build a telephone out of a speak & spell and an umbrella. dude was like a little brown macgyver."
31257,Raj,is that him over there?
30033,Raj,me? no. i just got vegas baby from vince vaughn in swingers. .
31569,Raj,"i think the next time i have to speak to a call centre in india, i’m going to try using an american accent."
33695,Raj,"i thought that, too. but then i got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again."
32960,Raj,and he’s all white.
32532,Raj,"we’re here for you, man. whatever you need, okay?"
29799,Raj,i always thought peppermint patty was a lesbian?
31097,Raj,"sheldon, dinner!"
30008,Raj,"great, so i can take them both out with a number-two pencil?"
32839,Raj,i want a picture with nathan fillion.
30019,Raj,"may i have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?"
33660,Raj,you’re welcome.
32977,Raj,"so, i’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. when you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it."
30526,Raj,do you want to do this or not?
30666,Raj,ah.
32233,Raj,"yeah, knock it off, howard."
31186,Raj,"dude, what is she saying?"
31130,Raj,oh. all right.
33643,Raj,"if we’re all gonna die, why am i eating so much kale?"
33668,Raj,it’s gross but i have to eat it because i met somebody.
33434,Raj,"no, i got it."
33414,Raj,i’m an astrophysicist. the stars don’t take a day off.
31137,Raj,"cool. can i say it fell apart because you were all, i want to have your babies, and i was like, i’m too rock and roll to be tied down?"
33295,Raj,"well, i’ve never seen you here before, claire."
29726,Raj,"three hundred, and i’ll throw in my original 1979 mattel millenium falcon with real light speed sound effects. "
33409,Raj,call you right back.
29607,Raj,"ever since i was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. how can i be a gynaecologist, i can barely look a woman in the eye. you know what, i’m not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it’s time for a showdown. somebody give me a computer with a webcam. "
33755,Raj,"this is not how i imagined this day going, i should be with them right now."
31028,Raj,no.
33802,Raj,"that’s actually not a bad idea. maybe i could even get them all together, sort of like a, a focus group, to find out what’s wrong with me."
31575,Raj,"all right, hotshot, let’s hear your indian."
31390,Raj,"well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! lava cake."
29953,Raj,that’s how we missed it.
33030,Raj,you guys ever notice that emily has a bit of a twisted side?
31589,Raj,"are you sure? they turn off the lights, and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place."
30103,Raj,it’s not about that.
30380,Raj,"well, how could you not put in an abort?"
33408,Raj,"i think we both know if i come over, we’re gonna get back together and…"
29835,Raj,"hey, buddy. i’m going to be in people magazine."
33044,Raj,"no, no, i’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and i’m dark on the outside."
30539,Raj,"big or small, i don’t like rabbits. they always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do."
29714,Raj,he’s got a point.
32032,Raj,"so, uh, who’s in?"
31329,Raj,"you know, if i had a week off, i’d go back to the two bunch palms resort and spa in the desert. i tell you, an hour on the massage table with trevor, and you’ll feel like you were born without bones."
29736,Raj,"we are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. why would they be looking for test subjects here? "
32984,Raj,"yeah. like when you took sheldon to texas and showed him all around nasa, you didn’t even think to ask me and leonard."
32097,Raj,"got it. now, uh, i have a question about the song. i was thinking at some point i could bust out a little rap."
31564,Raj,is this about the space thing again?
30245,Raj,i’m busy.
31374,Raj,"wow, what a bunch of nosey o’donnells."
31066,Raj,your big problem is me telling her.
30154,Raj,do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of john grisham?
34114,Raj,"so, you say you can’t pay your rent?"
31983,Raj,is that true?
30682,Raj,you said i could buy a desk.
32520,Raj,"well, me, neither."
32767,Raj,i’m worried about the new horizons space probe.
30730,Raj,"okay, i’m good."
33164,Raj,i don’t know if i’d say you… oh.
31156,Raj,"i, i nibbled. i was being playful."
33758,Raj,"for god’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you."
32581,Raj,"and this is leonard, this is penny."
31722,Raj,okay. did we at least rent the car from enterprise? get it? enterprise? screw you. that’s funny.
33766,Raj,really?
30308,Raj,and where were you?
30882,Raj,i’d like to weigh in here. no.
31627,Raj,holy crap!
31599,Raj,"look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars."
30926,Raj,"it’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. if you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! all right, you may talk in the bedroom, but i want this door to remain open! all right, just this once you may close the door. but keep in mind i’ll be right out here monitoring the situation!  priya, this is your brother. when you get this, tell leonard to check his voicemail."
32115,Raj,they’re just having a little trouble communicating. my dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
31928,Raj,don’t be ridiculous. waiter?
30951,Raj,beefaroni and a show? how do you turn that down?
30050,Raj,why don’t we take him to see the blue man group?
31007,Raj,my sister told me.
31929,Raj,hold on. isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?
33093,Raj,"dude, if we do this, we’re gonna need a cool band name."
33423,Raj,"i love it, i’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? and then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. yeah, i get it. i wouldn’t make out with me, either."
32705,Raj,"dude, my parents just split up."
32734,Raj,"oh, well, that’s the best part."
29880,Raj,"okay, i think i got it. "
32186,Raj,"and, amy, you need to be patient with sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms."
29940,Raj,really? i once saw him shopping at ralph’s. he was buying tequila.
29819,Raj,"okay, big buddy. see you tonight guys. "
30805,Raj,thank you. how come you didn’t call me this morning?
33959,Raj,i just never want to be a burden on my friends.
30904,Raj,"oh, right. good one."
32328,Raj,"what? you’ve kissed, like, once in three years."
31142,Raj,penny?
30799,Raj,"oh, you know. same old, same old. looked through a telescope, saw some stars. big whoop."
31668,Raj,"great. i bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address."
34140,Raj,no!
33528,Raj,"i, i think he wants us to pull over."
30519,Raj,"well, good for him."
30985,Raj,very basic.
32547,Raj,"that is weird. i thought he was, like, 45."
31890,Raj,i don’t know. maybe it’s all those steroids i’ve been taking.
33353,Raj,"i’d like to propose a toast to our friend, howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…"
30428,Raj,so?
29692,Raj,"yeah. sack up, dude. "
31689,Raj,i talk with my eyes.
32490,Raj,so the movie’s not as bad as you thought?
31256,Raj,you unfriended me? seriously?
32718,Raj,that’s rough.
30748,Raj,"no, just me. oh, there it is. here comes a cavity search."
30267,Raj,"hey, stuart, is the wil wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament the wil wheaton from star trek?"
31417,Raj,"i don’t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work."
31152,Raj,i’ll try it. like this?
32002,Raj,"no, no, no, that would be crazy. i mean, if i were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me."
30741,Raj,i’m brown and i talk funny.
33307,Raj,"uh, it’s hard to say. i think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if emily’s really the right person for me. i mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?"
34028,Raj,"well, i know how you feel. i tried one of those electronic japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room."
33428,Raj,"no, no, you’re pregnant. the only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow."
32100,Raj,"it will be. i don’t call anyone a ho, and the only time i use the phrase my bitch, i’m referring to you."
34011,Raj,"well, i’m very happy for you."
33454,Raj,i feel you. i’ve been dating multiple women.
31841,Raj,"if you want, we could tell you."
30532,Raj,"yeah, whatever. just go buy a sweater."
33918,Raj,what’s this?
32710,Raj,hey. what brings you by?
31562,Raj,can you believe stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party?
33362,Raj,"just bust a move,"
33644,Raj,"oh my god, that’s who you look like."
32979,Raj,"yeah, you’re missing the point, sheldon."
30209,Raj,will you come visit me in india?
32235,Raj,prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
29882,Raj,i saw what you did there.
31678,Raj,"amy, i’m really sorry. i didn’t mean to upset you."
32435,Raj,you better be. no jokes about how close i am with my dog. or the truth about how close i am with my dog.
32540,Raj,how so?
32430,Raj,you’re really going to do this?
30330,Raj,sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that i had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? rice!
21795,Raj,wait. it’s here.
30943,Raj,come on in.
33086,Raj,is that enough to melt the lug nut?
31876,Raj,i have to talk to her about this.
30415,Raj,the mysterious subcontinent of india.
31333,Raj,"oh, that’s a shame, he’s gonna be devastated."
32292,Raj,"oh, sure, i sit on the floor for years, no one cares. the pretty white girl’s there ten seconds, and suddenly we’re all running to ikea."
29614,Raj,i can’t believe i’m sitting here next to little lalita gupta. 
32045,Raj,"well, i thought… come on, i didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. and some of those puzzles were really hard and i didn’t know who was gonna get penny."
30035,Raj,what are you going to tell your mother?
34087,Raj,"oh dear, i am rightly and truly screwed. "
34015,Raj,so how did you two meet?
30020,Raj,why?
29949,Raj,maybe you could run some computer simulations.
33245,Raj,"no, you didn’t. there are millions of data points there."
30213,Raj,"okay, uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but i’d rather swim buck-naked across the ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you."
30270,Raj,"okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. sign here."
33888,Raj,"hello, father. we need to talk."
31991,Raj,"well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas."
30531,Raj,"then, put on a sweater."
30122,Raj,"oh, yeah."
30778,Raj,not if it has a hole in the middle.
31558,Raj,what’s wrong with you?
31712,Raj,"i’ll call 911. what, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants."
33800,Raj,"now that sheldon’s across the hall, have you decided what you’re doing with his old room?"
31891,Raj,"wait, wait. i, i found your blog here you wrote about me."
33084,Raj,"if you need a green hand, why not just use the hulk?"
33290,Raj,"i’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?"
32305,Raj,why me?
29840,Raj,"okey dokey, let’s roll. alright, it’s time to raise the roof. oo-ooh, oo-ooh."
29557,Raj,what is your move?
31392,Raj,i’d like to tell them things are going well.
31189,Raj,"good, good. oh, boy, help me out here. does she want me to kiss her or not?"
32374,Raj,any question but that.
31708,Raj,i say we begin with a classic star trek fight scene.
30851,Raj,stupid aquaman.
31266,Raj,"ordinary, yet i sense it is dripping with magical potential."
33272,Raj,"oh, ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there."
30496,Raj,sure. let go of the ring.
31510,Raj,cheers.
29919,Raj,"as with my father, i both love and fear it."
33910,Raj,what’s with the gloves?
31655,Raj,"no, screw that noise, i’m going in. hang on, santa, i’m coming for you."
33510,Raj,he’s got him there. the d even stands for department.
31653,Raj,"so, listen, i know we talked about getting a bite to eat in silver lake, and then seeing the christmas lights in griffith park, but leonard’s talking about a big d and d game at his place."
32664,Raj,how’s that going?
32449,Raj,"actually, how do you feel about watching house of 1000 corpses?"
33523,Raj,"howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help."
30721,Raj,"uh, my plans with priya."
33284,Raj,"you know it. oo-ah, oo-ah."
31308,Raj,"dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname."
31654,Raj,"oh, man, the first monster i see, i’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass."
30201,Raj,"no, no, it’s a very promising area. in a perfect world i’d spend several more years on it. but i just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis."
30476,Raj,"holy crap, are we nerdy."
32595,Raj,thanks for inviting us over.
31519,Raj,"bye, buddy!"
33117,Raj,"fine, i quit, too."
30083,Raj,"our dreams are very small, aren’t they?"
30292,Raj,"you’re a sucky friend, you know that? a sucky, sucky friend."
33775,Raj,so how were your holidays?
33848,Raj,i don’t need your help deciding when we need help!
31920,Raj,"i, uh, i’m sorry to put you through that."
31942,Raj,"if you look carefully at venus, you should be able to see the international space station pass by."
30771,Raj,do you think they gave wolverine an adamantium prostate?
32815,Raj,"guys, this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you."
29985,Raj,"no, you didn’t. i did."
30723,Raj,"hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of caprica last night?"
32084,Raj,"it is awesome. uh, you should probably go after her."
33625,Raj,"i’m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad."
29879,Raj,what?
30578,Raj,"guys, help me."
31831,Raj,"these spring rolls are amazing. good job, bernadette."
33745,Raj,"i’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?"
29814,Raj,dr gablehouser.
30740,Raj,"whoa, whoa, whoa! i don’t want to speak to the fbi."
30844,Raj,junior mints are pretty apologetic.
30127,Raj,what’s that?
32570,Raj,yup.
30618,Raj,"leonard, what are you talking about?"
31009,Raj,what can i do? i can’t stop thinking about her.
33598,Raj,"i have to say, i am happy with your obgyn."
30094,Raj,"no, it’s not. howard, tell them."
30037,Raj,but she did dump you.
31838,Raj,of course.
29698,Raj,it’s only $800?
31230,Raj,all right.  who do we have here?
30384,Raj,"and a cow and a penguin. face it dude, whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can’t drive."
32217,Raj,i’m sure you were great.
31789,Raj,we’re glad you could make it.
32059,Raj,"okay, now you’re talking like a winner!"
34156,Raj,"hey, leonard. what’s up? what? how did that happen? yeah, okay. i’ll be there as soon as i can. sorry. i have to run to the university."
30516,Raj,"okay in avatar when they have sex in pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk."
33063,Raj,now we are done.
32924,Raj,"yes, you are."
30536,Raj,don’t worry. you’re surrounded by your c-men.
31133,Raj,"of course. i’m always packing. anyway, um, i had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote."
30105,Raj,i thought we were going to be gentle with him.
33483,Raj,why would it be too big a step?
31442,Raj,"okay, uh, anybody else? huh? no? okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. ooh! this grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. okay, when i first came to this country, i-i didn’t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, i was pretty lonely. but then i met howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. this man became my whole world."
33379,Raj,"i know, she’s so thoughtful."
32920,Raj,"okay, uh, i’m gonna own you, bitch."
32082,Raj,"no, if i buy those, i just go through them like candy."
30297,Raj,"really? the only thing i’ve learned in the last two hours is that american men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections."
33373,Raj,"hey, guys. hey, penny. i really appreciate you helping me with this. i don’t know what to do."
30861,Raj,"hey, why am i in charge of phone support? seems a bit racist."
33932,Raj,"well, to be honest, leonard’s on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom."
30179,Raj,"oh, we are bad boys, aren’t we?"
29769,Raj,what did you do? did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
31960,Raj,"okay. i know. it was me. i, i pushed too hard. i’m sorry."
31664,Raj,that’s sweet of you. but what can you do to help?
30808,Raj,"just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies."
33478,Raj,"no, i’m still dating her."
31522,Raj,focused locust.
30204,Raj,"thank you, sir. "
32813,Raj,"i’ve, uh, created some other user accounts so i can post positive comments about their paper."
32693,Raj,how come you’re not shopping with amy and bernadette?
29787,Raj,"what happens in costume at comic-con, stays at comic-con."
30227,Raj,i need an aspirin.
31369,Raj,"just leave! okay, now. this is the way it’s supposed to be. men together, fighting the forces of evil."
33200,Raj,well what do you want to write?
30023,Raj,gotcha. i’ll have a brandy alexander.
32631,Raj,"yeah, sorry for clicking on that."
32572,Raj,"mmm, i love how they put a waterfall at centre field. it really ties the whole stadium together."
30435,Raj,"but if i don’t eat my lima beans, i can’t have my cookie."
31111,Raj,to friendship.
33856,Raj,she was blowing a spit bubble. it was adorable.
29568,Raj,what’s happening to us? we’re falling apart. 
33886,Raj,"guys, i’m not living in a garage."
32336,Raj,yes. where i can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. or you just write it for me.
30097,Raj,"so, who’s up for a movie?"
32701,Raj,"oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and i can’t think of a thing to get them."
31158,Raj,"yeah. hey, you know, if this was in sheldon and leonard’s apartment, i wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time."
32946,Raj,"exactly what i expected. two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. you two are out. congratulations, leonard, you’re on the team."
32771,Raj,"before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?"
31238,Raj,hummingbirds are pretty.
30491,Raj,also my cousin.
33309,Raj,i’m calling her. and the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got.
32031,Raj,just hear me out. i’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at m.i.t.
31893,Raj,"you called me feminine. and i, i wanted you to think i was more manly."
30994,Raj,are you listening to this guy?
32780,Raj,"if it’s okay with you, i’d like to go to temple."
31821,Raj,thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.
30755,Raj,"i think he’s eating lunch. uh, sheldon, i want you to meet neil degrasse tyson from the hayden planetarium in new york."
31121,Raj,"well, you were always so nice to me, i thought maybe you liked me."
33340,Raj,"but, amy, when you and sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?"
33960,Raj,"but i also upset sheldon, and he’s not gonna want to come over if i’m there."
30316,Raj,i’d like that. this is turning out to be a perfect saturday.
31058,Raj,"good, good. then you have nothing to worry about."
32911,Raj,"no, not at all."
29616,Raj,"you have lost so much weight! that must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! do you remember?"
32023,Raj,yay.
33978,Raj,i can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.
32283,Raj,"oh, yeah?"
30198,Raj,thank you.
29860,Raj,isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?
30935,Raj,"i’m not being a child. leonard, i swear to god, if your sister ever comes to town, i shall have my way with her."
33073,Raj,what’s wrong with mexico?
31071,Raj,"sorry, i’m just trying to cheer my buddy up. rotting zombie. sheldon’s new facebook photo."
31669,Raj,what?
33864,Raj,"what are you saying, that you’re giving up on me? what kind of father gives up on his son?"
31853,Raj,where have you been?
34071,Raj,dr. nowitzki. good to see you.
33537,Raj,that’s not him.
30433,Raj,great. it’s not like i brought it up because i wanted to go.
34109,Raj,and she was my second cousin.
33958,Raj,"well, no offence, but i didn’t go to art school. i have a phd in astrophysics."
30253,Raj,so walk home.
30681,Raj,and i can put it in your office?
29842,Raj,"hey, leonard, did you see my limo downstairs."
32331,Raj,"and judging by her lack of adam’s apple, she’s been female her entire life. i like that in a woman."
34068,Raj,sounds like a lot of work.
32753,Raj,what did you do?
31622,Raj,what the balls is forty-three?
33714,Raj,"he doesn’t just look like c-3po, now he walks like him."
30401,Raj,"sheldon, i’m begging you. i want to go to this mixer, and i don’t want to go alone."
32961,Raj,and gertie can’t stop crying.
29791,Raj,why?
33545,Raj,okay. 
30855,Raj,"that’s a hanukkah present you’re regretting, huh?"
32953,Raj,"okay, that sounds like us."
30760,Raj,i haven’t cried like this since toy story 3.
33609,Raj,hello.
32124,Raj,"well, i was feeling bad about how i acted the other night so i made you a little something."
32551,Raj,this is the part where you talk.
29993,Raj,"you mean one of the hopeless geeks? no. those are crazy people. howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. now, him, he’s one of those geeks."
32870,Raj,"oh, emily ran back to the hospital, so i’m just hanging out at her place. what are you, uh, what are you doing?"
30098,Raj,i say double feature.
31988,Raj,"wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting. "
31610,Raj,yeah. huh. forty-three? what the hell does that mean?
32442,Raj,"oh, uh, howard was an astronaut. maybe that’s where you saw him."
29926,Raj,"oh, snap."
30658,Raj,"i’m very comfortable here. penny, dear, why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?"
31915,Raj,"hey, come on, guys, focus. um, uh, oh, mighty nicolas cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.  oh, lucy’s free after all. see ya."
31781,Raj,"oh, well, i was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then i had to take her to the vet."
33298,Raj,sure. i love animated movies.
30907,Raj,"hey, don’t bag on sandra bullock! you think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter."
32261,Raj,that’s ’cause we’re the good guys.
31549,Raj,"yeah, you’ll love it. ain’t no party like a koothra-party."
30854,Raj,"oh, man. scooter sucks. he’s the aquaman of the muppet babies."
30517,Raj,"so, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails."
29758,Raj,what else? sell it on ebay as slightly used. 
30667,Raj,you’re kidding.
30911,Raj,"oh, boy! tator tots and a party invitation? what a great day!"
33387,Raj,"yeah, yeah. sure. what’s up?"
29923,Raj,"how about “die, toaster, die”?"
31766,Raj,"actually, i’m still here."
29764,Raj,"they also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. sadly, that’s my home run swing. "
32398,Raj,"ah, really? thank you. fate has given me a rare second chance, and i swear to vishnu i’m not gonna blow it. or normal words followed by a charming smile."
31607,Raj,"sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret."
32987,Raj,it streams hd video straight to your phone while it’s flying.
31794,Raj,"later, losers!"
31006,Raj,"i was when i came in, but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. besides what you might not know is, bernadette is planning on breaking up with howard."
33975,Raj,"don’t worry, jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour."
33075,Raj,"dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?"
30181,Raj,wow. what a great night.
33946,Raj,"sheldon, she’s fine."
29527,Raj,are there any chopsticks?
31805,Raj,"no, you don’t get it. i want nothing to do with any woman. my heart is stone. from now on, i’m a monk. i renounce all worldly pleasures. except for lobster. and garlic butter."
33374,Raj,"i hadn’t spoken to emily since i broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note."
33141,Raj,that’s a fair point. we wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.
31324,Raj,"ooh, sock mouth’s got him on the ropes."
29627,Raj,"maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, papa. "
32214,Raj,"i almost met someone last night, but i blew it. i was walking cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute i panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?"
31318,Raj,"well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?"
33221,Raj,i don’t know. have you ever seen a movie with stuart before?
32277,Raj,"owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare."
30528,Raj,"okay, you’re in sheldonopolis."
33807,Raj,hey. 
33543,Raj,"calm down, okay? try not to think about it."
30999,Raj,"no rush, no rush."
31143,Raj,it’s getting beautiful again.
33979,Raj,"oh, well, then i can actually feel the moisture going into my skin. "
32384,Raj,"fine, just try not to look too alive."
32180,Raj,nonsense. you need a little fattening up. you’ve been looking too skinny lately.
33323,Raj,and that’s how mommy and daddy met.
29980,Raj,what’s wrong with jiffy lubes?
31976,Raj,"no, it’s not. i haven’t had a drink since last night."
33500,Raj,"don’t listen to him. he says crazy things all the time. uh, watch. marco."
30610,Raj,"no, think about it. we make it an experiment. like when frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife."
33782,Raj,"oh come on, we just need to be more creative. what if you didn’t step on the floor at all? like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?"
30017,Raj,that’s right. she’s with us. guys like that are so pathetic.
32890,Raj,you’ve never snooped around my apartment?
29812,Raj,"hey guys, what’s up?"
32090,Raj,you called the right person. i believe i have the perfect romantic evening for you to give leonard.
31719,Raj,"don’t be like that. come on, howard, talk to him."
30504,Raj,"if you’re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies."
32793,Raj,"really? so every other place you’ve been, you thought this was fine?"
32998,Raj,i have to return the helicopter. my father… what did you do?
29765,Raj,"nice close up, by the way. "
30294,Raj,"oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. you don’t have a hammy."
32446,Raj,no problem. how’s your mom feeling?
29956,Raj,leviticus 11:3: “only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.”
30611,Raj,"okay, we’ll call that plan b."
30038,Raj,"oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky."
32905,Raj,you got it.
31219,Raj,of course. mrs. cooper. so nice to see you again.
30177,Raj,i’m sorry. go on.
30665,Raj,pardon?
32993,Raj,"oh, you’re where that bill goes."
33666,Raj,that’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
32222,Raj,that’s a mirror.
29906,Raj,"you’re lucky. with me, it’s usually the other way around."
30726,Raj,what? you slept with my sister?
30047,Raj,maybe i can save her.
32573,Raj,"hey, guys."
31501,Raj,i really thought she would say it.
31937,Raj,"well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than i do, and i find that very attractive in a woman. i, i don’t know. i just, i think you’re wonderful."
32676,Raj,preach.
33531,Raj,howard wolowitz?
33120,Raj,"thor said, that’s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura."
32656,Raj,it’s a little more bleak than i thought.
33267,Raj,yay.
29740,Raj,a hog? you have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front. 
31834,Raj,"well, put your mind at ease. i’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks howard’s dinner party’s ass. now, the first thing we need is a theme. i’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century moulin rouge."
30509,Raj,what?
31691,Raj,i both hate you and want to be you. this is ryan gosling all over again.
33005,Raj,"well, i like to think i take mostly after you. anyway, speaking of daddy, i had a very strange conversation with him. he said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life."
31459,Raj,"from that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. beautiful story, they’re in rival drug gangs, and they’re getting married. shh, no one can know."
30427,Raj,"no, i’m not jealous. all right, i’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. now, can we order?"
31601,Raj,"no, we both have to be the same thing. okay, we’re ninjas."
30241,Raj,no.
30334,Raj,"stop knocking! it’s open! please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and i can’t come home for my cousin sanjay’s wedding."
33027,Raj,"you’re kidding, right?"
32079,Raj,"oh, uh, on the off chance that bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize, how do you feel about mexican food for dinner tonight?"
32126,Raj,oh gets better.
31574,Raj,the guy’s a genius. maybe you weren’t challenging enough for him.
32696,Raj,"hey, here comes stuart and his date."
29687,Raj,hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
30133,Raj,hallway. 
32315,Raj,fine. but no more making fun of how i say tings.
34160,Raj,it was avenger versus archeologist.
30514,Raj,the fires of mount doom?
33193,Raj,"oh, this is cool. so, a few weeks ago i set up a fan page on facebook for our band and…"
29952,Raj,"hang on, hang on. there’s a 7-eleven here. we smuggle slurpies, which are essentially icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here."
29821,Raj,"it’s fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and i it. they shot me in front of a starry background where i posed like this.  they’re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent."
30032,Raj,"is it me, or was that sheldon’s way of saying vegas baby!"
33203,Raj,"let’s see. uh, his name is trent monaco."
33841,Raj,okay. you ladies have fun tonight.
32747,Raj,okay.
32104,Raj,there’s a new sports bar over on colorado ave…
29623,Raj,you are my lady. our parents said so. we are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
33491,Raj,you can’t let this stop you. almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.
32626,Raj,not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
31588,Raj,it was tapenade and you guys suck.
33524,Raj,"what about the guy on the channel four news? you know, four on your side? maybe he can be on your side."
31166,Raj,what’s it thinking about now?
30025,Raj,"oh, okay, okay, my turn. are you in the six star wars movies?"
30712,Raj,"alright, this goes without saying, but i’m just going to say it anyway. hands off my sister."
33396,Raj,"hi. i’m good. really good. well, i don’t know why i said really good. i’m just regular good. i really just wanted to sound confident. and that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really."
30355,Raj,"it’s your american accent. everything you say sounds stupid.  stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
32553,Raj,"but half-man, half-owl could fly…"
31126,Raj,it’s all over her facebook page.
33110,Raj,"you can do both, like michael jackson’s billie jean. while you’re dancing you’re thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?"
32816,Raj,"yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. focus on those."
31933,Raj,"you don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity."
34012,Raj,can’t believe bert has a girlfriend and i don’t.
29551,Raj,make way for the fastest man alive.  oh no!
30460,Raj,but i never will.
33961,Raj,"i appreciate it, but i think staying with leonard and penny makes more sense for everyone."
33505,Raj,"uh, i’d say by three."
33251,Raj,"okay, the final image is coming in. and the object we discovered is…"
31300,Raj,"thanks, barry. siri, remind me friday morning to make my famous popovers."
33915,Raj,"stay, i’ll get her."
32491,Raj,thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. aren’t you gonna get 3-d glasses?
34058,Raj,how are you doing with…
29665,Raj,we need a social catalyst.
33476,Raj,"oh, that’s great. i’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity."
29729,Raj,"too bad, i called dibs."
30285,Raj,"leonard just realized that penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny, little man who flies kites."
29534,Raj,i’ve got him leonard. tonight i spice my meat with goblin blood!
33641,Raj,i’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.
31878,Raj,"no, it’s not. i’ve always thought that was unfair."
30776,Raj,"ooh, ooh! do our babies will be smart and beautiful. that one always makes me laugh."
31460,Raj,where did he pop the question? what did you say?
30919,Raj,"cool, buddy! that’s awesome!"
32221,Raj,"i don’t know. they’re dressed very stylishly. they’re probably stuck-up. this is ridiculous. the next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. we’re gonna die here."
32333,Raj,"emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower."
30641,Raj,"all right, uh, forget pulling. how about we get an electric saw and cut it off?"
29974,Raj,did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
30337,Raj,"oh, that is completely below the belt. sheldon, tell my parents that howard and i are just friends. sheldon? howard and i are just friends! fine. i’ll come home for sanjay’s wedding."
31784,Raj,it’s nice that all the people who are lonely on valentine’s day can come here tonight and be together.
30940,Raj,i’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful sheldon-free evening.
31642,Raj,just say it.
32989,Raj,i don’t know. why do i own one?
32856,Raj,"not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place."
30678,Raj,"oh, but there’s money for a drawer full of red vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?"
34161,Raj,"hey, claire. hi. it’s, it’s rajesh. i was, i was wondering if you’re free for valentine’s day?"
32721,Raj,"roger abbott, roger abbott, roger abbott. oh, my god, leonard, i know he’s dead, but try it. it’s fun. roger abbott, roger abbott."
32197,Raj,"oh. hang on. you got a, you got a little something. ah."
33642,Raj,we don’t get paid? nothing? not even a sandwich?
31000,Raj,i know. it’ll be awful.
31340,Raj,i’m glad that men are wearing hats again. they’re so distinguished.
30318,Raj,"if you want to chase after her, chase after her."
31825,Raj,"excuse me, i thought we were trying to solve my problem?"
31268,Raj,"can’t you just enjoy the wonder, sheldon? why must you peek behind the curtain? or up the butt?"
33395,Raj,will do.
32689,Raj,like who?
31237,Raj,i really don’t get your problem with birds.
30283,Raj,no! not enchanted bunny!
31204,Raj,what? you’re going to make me choose between the woman i love and the money i have very strong feelings for?
33168,Raj,"i, i hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard."
32229,Raj,he brought you a pretty rock.
30564,Raj,"no, i won’t."
31701,Raj,"oh, of course not. she was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles."
34036,Raj,"damn it, he’s good at that, too."
32523,Raj,"it’s a piercing. so, uh, how many tattoos?"
29887,Raj,"actually, i was just checking my e-mail. but, uh, no, the rover is not responding."
33265,Raj,that’s just amy.
33315,Raj,"i knew it. okay, we did have a vibe. this is exciting. what’s my next move?"
32830,Raj,"i was distracted. it’s weird seeing a member of the night’s watch with a kayak strapped to his car. come on. hi, excuse me, s, sorry, i, i don’t mean to bother you, but we’re just really big fans of firefly. and dr. horrible."
33026,Raj,ooh. hot date?
21792,Raj,you’re the guy we’re trying to get away from.
29521,Raj,"of all the howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite."
30399,Raj,i don’t want to go to flatland.
33560,Raj,and you just let him?
32790,Raj,"you see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? it’s called a sikhara. it symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine."
31175,Raj,then spell it.
32749,Raj,"all i’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. it. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now i have to hear the two of you? and who cares who’s smarter? if it’s leonard or me or, you know, it’s christmas, let’s say it’s howard."
31380,Raj,yes.
30237,Raj,"ah, well, in this context… "
32534,Raj,"well, i can’t take all the credit. she let me do it to her, but, uh, but i can always call her and cancel."
33436,Raj,"i appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. i overstepped my bounds."
31489,Raj,sweet!
31660,Raj,can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? don’t worry. it’s my treat.
30873,Raj,"well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? you know, get the word of mouth going."
31587,Raj,"ooh, this is exciting. like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties."
29684,Raj,then we can be the bengal tigers.
33832,Raj,"very mature. keep eating like that, you’re gonna have a heart attack."
29932,Raj,"excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without wolowitz? have you heard from penny yet?"
33818,Raj,"well, that’s hard to hear, but i’ll still take you back."
29753,Raj,thank you. i apprec….  apprec…. appreeee…. oh-oh.
33214,Raj,"it’s okay. oh, it’s okay. he’s done."
31075,Raj,i guess that’s okay.
34127,Raj,"sheldon, i’m talking to someone. you’re being rude. i’ll bet you’re an actress. if not, you should be. you have a very expressive face."
29709,Raj,cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
30763,Raj,"you know, guys, when facing disappointment, eat, pray, love teaches us–"
34171,Raj,yes.
30648,Raj,"that’s two, dude. write your own jokes."
31349,Raj,"what, you don’t like wind chimes?"
31808,Raj,"i must be strong so i don’t stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe."
29649,Raj,"here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness. "
30149,Raj,"well, i finished reading the pelican brief and loved it so much, i dived right into the client. he was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining."
33606,Raj,"okay, well, that’s a problem."
32301,Raj,"and if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son howard. i’m just kidding. we’ll name him dalib, after my grandfather."
33738,Raj,i’ll pull the van up.
31509,Raj,"she’s kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?"
33421,Raj,i know. you guys should totally be making out with me.
31665,Raj,"okay. well, a couple of things. don’t tell them i come from money. i want them to love me for me. they must be insanely hot. like, nines or tens."
29662,Raj,it’s possible she may have misunderstood us. 
31973,Raj,"penny, i, i miss her already."
29832,Raj,would you like to go with me?
32412,Raj,did he help you make a decision about the movie?
30579,Raj,the cosmological physicist from princeton?
32531,Raj,"dude, i’m so sorry."
32802,Raj,"you know what? i think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. maybe the truth is, you’re jealous of all my relationships."
30000,Raj,"let’s find out. leonard, ready?"
34019,Raj,"hey. yeah. hey, sorry if last night was awkward."
30261,Raj,why don’t i just tell you what i heard today.
30104,Raj,"for me, it was a bonding moment."
31994,Raj,"you know, i recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins."
30877,Raj,okay. come on in.
29532,Raj,oooh.
32116,Raj,i didn’t know you were coming again.
33526,Raj,"uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us."
32357,Raj,"not my best first date. yeah, but not my worst, either."
31662,Raj,"no, no, no, i’m fine."
31898,Raj,why don’t you put your mother in a home?
31102,Raj,it’s a good thing.
30457,Raj,"you know what? even though i don’t have a girlfriend, i can still have a good time on valentine’s day."
33993,Raj,"genius. i was gonna say, why does anyone think sheldon’s a genius? but i didn’t."
33025,Raj,looks good.
30921,Raj,i forbid it.
34089,Raj,"i can’t feel my fingers, hurry up. "
33275,Raj,"okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology."
34042,Raj,without me.
30085,Raj,is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away?
32361,Raj,"good. sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. we even ordered from the thai place he doesn’t like."
32029,Raj,"don’t worry, i can take a hint. no more murder mystery parties."
30984,Raj,what’s the matter?
33669,Raj,isabella. 
29934,Raj,"that’s not overconfidence, that’s observation."
32094,Raj,"oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air."
32016,Raj,"i’m not sure. um, wait. jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. uh, no, i, i still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? okay, uh, give me some of this."
31703,Raj,howard built a sex robot.
29586,Raj,"but papa, i’m not supposed…"
33579,Raj,i skipped spin class for this.
31553,Raj,"ooh, hallow-weenies! that’s a good one. they’ll pair nicely with my draculoni and cheese. how do i do it?"
30938,Raj,"okay, we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own."
31528,Raj,"yeah, well, i love her."
32884,Raj,you’re not helping.
34051,Raj,"come on, sheldon. amy’s only gone for a few months. and now that i’m moving out, your old room is empty, so you can stay there whenever you want."
32930,Raj,"so, bernadette, have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?"
30743,Raj,nobody cares. do you know how long it’s been since i got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
33850,Raj,how is that a t?
30924,Raj,"clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, mike."
32691,Raj,"oh, yeah, i got that evite. ever since i saw pretty in pink, i’ve wanted to go to an american prom. but then i saw carrie, and i did not want to go to an american prom. but then i saw never been kissed, and i’m back on the prom bandwagon. this prom thing’s been a real roller coaster."
33878,Raj,i don’t want to say.
31061,Raj,"what do you mean, a show?"
31554,Raj,"so, i thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb, or they also have the tardis from doctor who."
33190,Raj,me.
32353,Raj,your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
32469,Raj,may the fourth be with you?
31620,Raj,"yeah, me, too. we’ve got more important things to do. who cares what stupid forty-three means?"
32049,Raj,"stuart and i are putting dating profiles online, and it’s one of the questions. and thank you, i’d kill for that woman’s bone structure."
34152,Raj,"all right, teams. get ready to open your first puzzle. go. do you see what i did? the first puzzle is a puzzle. oh, my god, how adorable is that? i wish i had a friend like me."
30304,Raj,"the kite you made me lose was an authentic patang, an indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from new delhi. it took me a day to put together and two days to paint. this is hello kitty."
31320,Raj,"all right, um, how about, oh, how about rocket man?"
32727,Raj,"i was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of hubble’s law. i keep seeing the number 90 repeating. that could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy."
30729,Raj,how hard did she stomp?
33591,Raj,"happy and well-fed. you see, that’s what i’m taking from that story."
33597,Raj,well i don’t.
30816,Raj,"oh, hey."
33928,Raj,"but i can use the downstairs bathroom, right?"
33003,Raj,"okay. okay, you’re right. it’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. be a man.  hello, mummy."
30264,Raj,but this is other money.
29800,Raj,hey guys.
31240,Raj,"yes, please. this is way better than the movie."
29856,Raj,i like comic books.
32017,Raj,do you want my help or not?
30175,Raj,"oh, they did. like jasmine and honeysuckle."
29779,Raj,"well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, sheldon…"
32642,Raj,exactly.
31068,Raj,he takes the elf from off the shelf.
33150,Raj,"oh, okay. got it."
33367,Raj,"you know, adam west is my favourite batman? well, after michael keaton, christian bale and batman from the lego movie."
30813,Raj,"you don’t like mouse boy? how about, uh, uh, kid vermin?"
31362,Raj,i can never find the tiller. i got a book; it didn’t help.
30704,Raj,"when i call him, his phone plays brown eyed girl. which, now that i think about it, is not so good."
31949,Raj,"the only person allowed inside this head is dr. phil. anyway, i, i spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one."
32366,Raj,welcome to another classic koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
29674,Raj,unbelievable.
29841,Raj,dude.
29845,Raj,welcome to the raj mahal.
29574,Raj,what?
32108,Raj,"yeah, it’s nothing to cry about."
31677,Raj,"nope. i guess the heart wants what the heart wants. or in this case, doesn’t, i mean, at all. what?"
32138,Raj,can i tell her i miss her?
32929,Raj,"hmm. what if he’s in prison? what if he’s a spy? what if he’s in a beatles cover band? i’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer ringo."
31402,Raj,ready for lunch?
31984,Raj,"how can i meet someone new when everywhere i look, i see lucy’s face? tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie."
34026,Raj,"sheldon, get over here and help."
31563,Raj,"what do you mean who cares? look at what i pulled off here. the dj’s on fire, there’s a tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my god, the food. stuart wanted kraft draculoni and cheese."
33944,Raj,"thank you, but how do i know you’re not saying that just to be nice?"
31118,Raj,rubbish. he’s talking rubbish.
31144,Raj,screw you. that was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
33661,Raj,okay.
31809,Raj,wait! give me the number! give me the number! give me the number!
32356,Raj,"uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing."
33730,Raj,why are you being like this?
34168,Raj,yes.
33861,Raj,"uh, well, i was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up."
34053,Raj,"well, here’s your key back."
32880,Raj,she does.
31688,Raj,how could you do that to me? you know i’ve been working it with alex for weeks.
32344,Raj,stop that? okay.
32536,Raj,i’m having my windows untinted.
30884,Raj,"mmm, i know the feeling. it’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. it-it happened to a friend of mine."
29947,Raj,stu the cockatoo?
31755,Raj,sure.
33100,Raj,"that is, that is so good!"
33965,Raj,"hey, we wrote the kama sutra. if it involves butts, there’s a word for it."
32072,Raj,"i think it could be romantic. you know, my parents met at his place of work. "
33836,Raj,"you know, i just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years."
29660,Raj,we can’t send him back to north korea. he knows how to get out. 
30689,Raj,no.
30927,Raj,why are you holding hands? i forbid you to hold hands.
31145,Raj,"sure, whatever."
29813,Raj,"it’s very nice of you, i would like that."
31077,Raj,leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate star trek sex with my sister.
31479,Raj,really? i can come? thanks.
32765,Raj,"i can’t take it, dude."
31967,Raj,"uh, go ahead. read it."
32679,Raj,the gun from hellboy?
30954,Raj,"son of a gun, you’re blowing my mind!"
33287,Raj,"i’m sorry, and how much money did your version of frozen make?"
34149,Raj,this was really fun.
30671,Raj,"i’m telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong."
33757,Raj,"and, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let stuart stay."
30777,Raj,miss.
30015,Raj,also a good plan.
30707,Raj,"dude, why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with wolowitz?"
33250,Raj,"unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet."
33326,Raj,spending valentine’s day with emily.
29630,Raj,this has nothing to do with my sperm count.
30800,Raj,why? you writing a book?
29538,Raj,like who?
33090,Raj,"hey, we’ve always talked about playing together."
32525,Raj,"but, uh, before i take my shirt off, i just need like ten minutes to do some crunches."
33604,Raj,flip a coin. you got a fifty-fifty shot.
30744,Raj,"oh, bella, don’t you see? edward’s only pushing you away because he loves you.  coming."
31062,Raj,"like, to music?"
32106,Raj,you think they came up with that? they were going to drink beer and play darts.
34148,Raj,"ooh, fun. i love prom. the romance, the gowns, it’s like a fairy tale come to life. sorry. autocorrect. that was supposed to say, i like sports."
30028,Raj,c3po.
33998,Raj,you’re not going to prison.
31419,Raj,"oh, boy, sheldon’s going to freak out."
31036,Raj,"i’m a scientist. my ability to think is my bread and butter. i’m afraid if i take this, i might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field."
31302,Raj,good timing. dinner’s almost ready.
32681,Raj,"oh, i was hoping for a juicy tidbit about ron perlman’s testicles."
33301,Raj,"yeah, bye."
32299,Raj,"a second trip to space, i’ll miss you."
31164,Raj,that’s cruel. you know it goes straight to my hips.
29556,Raj,"penny is wearing the worst catwoman costume i have ever seen, and that includes halle berry’s."
33078,Raj,are you turning it the right way?
29921,Raj,"okay. ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the magic eight ball."
32274,Raj,except i’ll be alone.
33490,Raj,hey.
33852,Raj,"fine, you drink it."
31526,Raj,"uh, yeah, last night. he kept making me drop pencils for him. i got uncomfortable.   che-ee-ee-ese."
30971,Raj,"i have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?"
32746,Raj,hey.
31468,Raj,"guys, when i look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, it fills my, heart, okay, i’m going to need a minute."
31905,Raj,hmm. interesting. did they take a walk down liars’ lane?
31849,Raj,"you have no idea. they buy me a new bmw for my birthday but can i get seat warmers? no. rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself. well, maybe i will, old man."
31346,Raj,"i’m happy for you, sheldon. but i have to admit i’m going to miss sharing an office with you."
31899,Raj,thank you.
32129,Raj,"so, how are you gonna return the dvd if the store went out of business?"
32944,Raj,"anyway, i’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system."
31819,Raj,"go out with me on one date, and i promise you, you’ll see."
32207,Raj,what are you doing?
32192,Raj,i’ve never seen it.
33811,Raj,"i did do that. i can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries. howard, would you write that down?"
31140,Raj,cool. all right friend.
32907,Raj,"mm, and not a vegetable in sight."
32851,Raj,"well, even if the study’s nonsense, i don’t believe in tempting fate. same reason i wouldn’t use a ouija board, or pick a fight with an asian guy. he probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?"
33976,Raj,"it didn’t work for randy, it didn’t work for tina, it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for jennifer."
30923,Raj,forbaded it?
30589,Raj,it is if you love her and give her a name.
33277,Raj,what are you doing?
32933,Raj,"okay, you got me there. you here looking for money?"
32111,Raj,thank you.
32843,Raj,what can we do?
32515,Raj,"of course. please, come in."
32078,Raj,amy.
30713,Raj,i’m so not talking to you. i’m talking to him.
31797,Raj,what?
30735,Raj,"as long as we’re apologising, sheldon, i, i’m sorry i used your toothbrush."
29966,Raj,"well, then why didn’t you say that to her?"
29530,Raj,"well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. then there was something about you and… then she hugged me."
30819,Raj,what the heck is this?
33700,Raj,"i’m sorry. honestly, i didn’t think your job would bother me, but i guess it did. and i hate myself for that. but there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you."
30117,Raj,"give it up, dude, you’re arguing with a crazy person."
29613,Raj,okay.
32616,Raj,"hey, the future they show in back to the future ii is only a year away. a lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet."
33565,Raj,"well, i didn’t get to see you last night. it was the least i could do."
32823,Raj,"yeah, you should have burned it down years ago."
31907,Raj,"well, i trusted you, and you let me down. the poor thing’s been shaking for hours."
34078,Raj,thank you.
33570,Raj,you have to get to it eventually.
33037,Raj,you’re one to talk. you’ve been complaining about stuart living here for the past year. i don’t see you showing him the door.
31154,Raj,better?
33495,Raj,"uh, she’s seeing me."
31201,Raj,"i have a surprise for you. cover your eyes. open them. it’s a real ruby. it was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. although, the people at cartier took a pretty good shot at it.  oh, mummy, daddy. what a nice surprise."
30859,Raj,"no. you take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. why does everything have to be dirty with you?"
30315,Raj,i really like my saber-toothed cat. thank you.
32863,Raj,"oh, okay. uh, brothers and sisters i have none, but this man’s father is my father’s son. who am i looking at? yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. calm down."
34048,Raj,"i am, but i’ll miss you guys."
34157,Raj,"okay, thanks, bernadette. travel safe. okay, bye. well, they’ve booked a flight. they’re heading to the airport now."
30779,Raj,a romulan battle bagel?
31801,Raj,"why not? with online shopping and overnight delivery, i can get anything i want. look, i just ordered a case of dinty moore beef stew and two live lobsters on amazon."
30333,Raj,"oh, sure, you can tell when sheldon’s upset."
30129,Raj,"oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess."
33676,Raj,"no, i grew up with a house full of servants and now i have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who i have great respect for."
32660,Raj,but you’re okay with superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
30327,Raj,you mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?
30166,Raj,are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?
31859,Raj,"you two should be ashamed of yourselves. using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever amy plans on doing."
31650,Raj,you can do it.
33199,Raj,"how about, uh, oh, how about, we might be footprints on the moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon."
33803,Raj,yeah. i’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how i can be a better boyfriend.
33161,Raj,"oh, right, uh, girlfriend. okay."
33133,Raj,how many sips of that beer did he have?
30150,Raj,"great. lost boys, children of the night. got it. can you pass the chex mix, please. thank you. we are lost boys."
30206,Raj,"thank you. would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? so, when do i start?"
30434,Raj,"no, it’s okay. i don’t have to go. i’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. i’m a walking brown yelp.com."
29705,Raj,one.
32593,Raj,"you, okay? it’s you. you’re, you’re next."
30807,Raj,we’re good.
32404,Raj,"uh, xbox one."
31790,Raj,what is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
21786,Raj,hilarious.
32903,Raj,"okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna."
31621,Raj,let’s go home. you want to get something to eat?
30485,Raj,"okay, that’s a lot of money. the wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. like a jet ski."
30414,Raj,how do you do? rajesh ramayan koothrappali. call me raj.
29982,Raj,holy crap! look!
33645,Raj,"not me, i’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships."
29547,Raj,she didn’t take my order.
32371,Raj,"very good, bernadette. you are a regular byomkesh bakshi."
30224,Raj,"sorry, go ahead and make your joke."
31911,Raj,anything can happen.
31293,Raj,"ah, one name. like, uh, cher, madonna, adele. all the women who rock me. my name is rajesh, but you can call me raj."
30280,Raj,"okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! now, come on, sheldon, finish him off!"
33179,Raj,how could you send her away?
30156,Raj,uh… blackened salmon?
32804,Raj,i don’t think that’s what you want at all.
30916,Raj,do him first.
31117,Raj,"he’s the hindu version of cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot."
31227,Raj,what is she doing in a comic book store?
32919,Raj,"uh, yeah, i mean, her serve was pretty good."
30134,Raj,"my stomach. indian food doesn’t agree with me. ironic, isn’t it?"
33450,Raj,"no, it’s just, ever since i started dating claire and emily at the same time, it’s exhausting."
31437,Raj,"hey, everybody! the bachelor boy has arrived! for he’s a jolly good fellow…"
33679,Raj,"oh, so, you are unencumbered?"
33356,Raj,i hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
31780,Raj,"hey, stuart, you got anything going on for valentine’s day?"
31862,Raj,you’re right. this is beneath me. lie your mother was last night.
31234,Raj,"mm, i’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache."
33460,Raj,"okay, that i said. but that’s a real problem. you give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. maybe the other girl, but not her."
31490,Raj,"you know, i’m growing to like american football. "
30390,Raj,what about me?
33351,Raj,i wasn’t joking.
30545,Raj,did you start waxing?
30429,Raj,"not tso the chicken, so the question. so?"
30770,Raj,you know who’s got to be the bravest person in the marvel universe? whoever has to give she-hulk a bikini wax.
31217,Raj,"well, i just met her gynaecologist!"
29868,Raj,"there’s the house, freeze frame, freeze frame."
34057,Raj,i can’t compete with that. bye.
31734,Raj,"you know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us."
32524,Raj,"it’s, uh, been a long time since i’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder."
31910,Raj,"sorry. i, i just…"
33890,Raj,"yes, that is wonderful. you will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled."
34041,Raj,without me.
30827,Raj,"i say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?"
33198,Raj,maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.
33808,Raj,"okay, first off, i want to thank you all so much for coming. howard is here to interpret for emily, and to take notes. "
30549,Raj,"ah, the premature i love you."
33184,Raj,do you ever do anything for anyone else?
34088,Raj,i have to go.   
32067,Raj,"this is the worst. if we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school."
33612,Raj,"i don’t know. if i want to watch old people sweat, i can just facetime my family in india."
30223,Raj,"ooh, dark matter. we better bring a flashlight. i was making a joke."
31728,Raj,no.
31463,Raj,"i keep telling you, if i wasn’t an astrophysicist, i would have been a party planner. it was always a coin flip."
33464,Raj,"it’s not what i have, it’s how many people i’m having it with."
31727,Raj,"what do you think, sheldon? want an action figure that looks just like you?"
30638,Raj,penis first?
31770,Raj,but i have a cream sherry hangover and i smell blintzes.
29760,Raj,incredible. you managed to screw up the screw-up. 
30040,Raj,"i’m telling you, leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. disneyland can suck it. this is the real happiest place on earth."
31048,Raj,"ooh, fire demon. sheldon’s turning up the heat."
33045,Raj,end things? i’m trying to tell you that i love you.
32959,Raj,"well, my feelings were real when he was about to die."
31132,Raj,"no, no. after we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if i had protection."
30596,Raj,"go away. she wants new delhi, not kosher deli. besides, you have a girlfriend."
31245,Raj,"stuart, settle an argument for us. who would win, billy the kid or the white wizard?"
32133,Raj,"what is wrong with you, penny? you ruined any chance i had of getting back with lucy. now she knows i’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.  it’s lucy. she wants to meet for coffee. i love you, penny."
29732,Raj,"i’ll match it, plus a thousand rupees. "
31726,Raj,"yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. you can even choose your accessories."
29970,Raj,"god, i love the smell of paintballs in the morning."
33043,Raj,"look, i care about you a lot, but we are very different people."
33046,Raj,who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
32324,Raj,"actually, it’s for both of us. last night, i watched west side story, and i’m a little freaked out by street gangs."
29629,Raj,"go ahead, tell my parents why they won’t have any grandchildren."
32908,Raj,i would like to propose a salon topic.
29829,Raj,"oh, okay, leonard?"
30065,Raj,interesting. penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
31031,Raj,"i’m going to be 30 years old, and i have no one in my life to love me. i’m such a basket case, i can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body."
30461,Raj,what? i’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. people will know i’m awesome and to be feared.
31895,Raj,yeah.
32060,Raj,"three, two, one. "
32932,Raj,enough chitchat. how do we know you are who you say you are?
32471,Raj,can i make you breakfast? admiral ackbar’s snack bar is open for business.
31634,Raj,that’s called a fashion choice.
29839,Raj,"nothing, i was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous."
33096,Raj,i just got chills.
31753,Raj,is there a good anal leakage?
34165,Raj,"your movie’s showing, so you’re going. could care less about the five you’re blowing. theatre gets dark just to start the show. you spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she’s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. you run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move."
33603,Raj,it was an accident. the doctor left the folder out on her desk. it’s not my fault i opened it and looked.
31572,Raj,"sheldon, do i really sound like that?"
32063,Raj,"what? another one. you know, it, it’s weird. when they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? like they see you naked?"
34007,Raj,bye.
32130,Raj,i don’t get it.
30231,Raj,i’m the astrophysicist. astro means space.
33440,Raj,are you sure you can do this?
32695,Raj,"ooh, i’ll, uh, text stuart, let him know we’re close."
33384,Raj,maybe you’re right.
32704,Raj,"well, they weren’t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. oh, maybe i could make a gift for them. i know how much you guys love the coasters i made for you."
32021,Raj,"you know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that going for you."
30123,Raj,disappointed? let down?
30002,Raj,what’s the matter?
32629,Raj,no way. not bill murray.
32376,Raj,"well, unlike that, my games are much more fun."
32145,Raj,"i think i know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?"
29555,Raj,"mmmm, by odin’s beard, this is good chex mix. "
33690,Raj,"oh, come on, we’re in the telescope room. it’ll be like dining under the stars. you see this, uh, double zero? when it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. sometimes it takes a while."
32083,Raj,thanks.
31889,Raj,what do you mean?
30139,Raj,"oh, i really don’t care anymore"
31264,Raj,"that was pretty badass, dude."
33294,Raj,"i’m raj, by the way. this is howard."
33441,Raj,"i buried it there, so we could go home."
30003,Raj,"you know, if i wanted to spend my saturday nights doing this, i could have stayed in india."
31759,Raj,"no, thank you, mrs. wolowitz. as it is, i’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like i’m a fireman rescuing an infant."
32337,Raj,"i don’t want you to pretend to be me. you can be like my, uh, online wingman. like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up."
30342,Raj,"yes, it’s not the same without him. "
33103,Raj,that’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off.
31455,Raj,"when you come back to earth in a soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. and the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture rocky and bullwinkle."
32674,Raj,"oh, cool."
30101,Raj,thanks.
33736,Raj,i’ll do it.
31515,Raj,"hey, stuart."
31538,Raj,so you’re wandering all around by yourself? that’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.
33650,Raj,"we can, but for the record, all chaps are assless."
30176,Raj,"and then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us."
31541,Raj,"it’s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other’s holes."
33431,Raj,"please, my pleasure."
33363,Raj,"just bust a move,"
31921,Raj,what else have you been thinking about doing?
31945,Raj,"let’s see. six. that’s pretty cool, i have six friends. kind of like sinatra."
30453,Raj,i know. i saw the tweet.
30538,Raj,interesting. that might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. you know what i’m talking about.
30668,Raj,he takes the kitty to the potty?
32861,Raj,"okay, we’ve got the cipher decoded."
31449,Raj,"seriously, you don’t even have to stop the car. anything under ten miles an hour and i can combat-roll into the street."
29663,Raj,"oh, yes. there was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16. "
29631,Raj,yes mommy.
30814,Raj,rat-man is nobody’s sidekick.
32716,Raj,"oh, like you and i did at couples therapy."
33788,Raj,why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
30312,Raj,i don’t know.
29939,Raj,"mmm, gentlemen, i put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour."
32057,Raj,"well, okay, you’re a, you’re a talented artist, you own your own business."
32821,Raj,"yeah, you keep setting me up for failure."
29886,Raj,i have three words for you. wrath of khan.
31037,Raj,"thank you for coming with me, sheldon. you’re a good friend."
30837,Raj,just because i didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! you bloviating buffoon!
32259,Raj,"okay, so, i’m on a comic-con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. guys, if i go to jail dressed as the human torch, that might send the wrong message."
33749,Raj,"i, i said she, but lot’s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!"
30347,Raj,"so, what are we waiting for?"
31348,Raj,"well, at least you finally got a window that opens. that’s nice."
31399,Raj,i like to boogie.
32410,Raj,any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?
29852,Raj,why did howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
30080,Raj,"wow, that’s heavy."
33479,Raj,"they know that we’re not exclusive, and we just don’t ask too many questions."
29582,Raj,"okay, that’s my life, that’s my friends, good to see you, say goodbye."
31456,Raj,you weren’t?
29573,Raj,"all i’ve got is a needler, and i’m all out of ammo. "
32652,Raj,"well, that’s what we wanted. this is as hot as the mines will be."
31151,Raj,how can you be so racist?
31367,Raj,"bernadette, remember, your character’s the healer in our group. you’re in charge of healing all of us, not just howard."
32385,Raj,perhaps this will help. here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
33667,Raj,there’s nothing to tell.
34136,Raj,"hey, buddy, how’s it going up there?"
30944,Raj,"i’d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky."
30850,Raj,looks like someone else is going to have to be wonder woman.
33772,Raj,"oh, he’s really good with her."
33546,Raj,"oh, come on. what’s the worst that could come of this meeting?"
33709,Raj,"this is tough, but i’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me youtube videos of people getting hit in the nuts."
29973,Raj,we hide behind the dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
33113,Raj,"no, no. i’m just evolving as a musician. you’re the one who’s stuck in the past."
31190,Raj,"if you were me, would you kiss her?"
33268,Raj,"sheldon, stop being a baby and let emily take a look at you."
33397,Raj,"i don’t know. i lost track and i missed my exit. so, uh, so what’s up?"
29837,Raj,"it was in the limo. they sent a limo. i have a limo. i just love saying limo. here, sip on this while you’re getting ready."
30600,Raj,"okay, show of hands. who’s up for this? "
33792,Raj,i broke up with her.
32798,Raj,"go ahead, make fun. you can’t embarrass me, i’ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater."
31206,Raj,"my parents are making me choose between money and you. i choose you.  and that necklace, yeah, that, too. but none of those things matter, because we have something better. we have love."
31208,Raj,sometimes i put the tv on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. but i can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.
33119,Raj,what took you so long?
33658,Raj,"oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip tootsie rolls in nutella. "
30622,Raj,really? us gonna tell him?
31716,Raj,"and about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now."
29605,Raj,"where did my life go, penny? one day i’m a carefree batchelor, and the next i’m married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban new delhi. "
32436,Raj,no jokes about the year i took ballet.
32646,Raj,did you get in?
33973,Raj,so did you confront jennifer?
34034,Raj,"okay. shall we? oh, my god. it’s light, it’s flaky, it’s buttery. you don’t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these."
33997,Raj,"nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook."
29579,Raj,he lives with leonard. 
31101,Raj,"he’s living at my place, so i’m living here."
33849,Raj,"yes, so, i was just warming up some milk for halley, and i thought it smelled a little funky, so i checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says flerbsday."
31836,Raj,"well, come on, we won’t tell anyone."
30941,Raj,sheldon tells it better.
31453,Raj,all right. more sailor moon for me.
30462,Raj,can’t believe it. we’re going to meet stan lee! 
31998,Raj,"you know, you, you and i, you and i have a lot in common."
29883,Raj,"yeah, star trek v, worse than i."
30439,Raj,he never went back to the university?
31956,Raj,what the? are you crazy? you can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. it makes them socially anxious!
31271,Raj,"wow, that’s rough. where’d you get that?"
32249,Raj,"uh, what number in line are you?"
29531,Raj,"intoxicating, isn’t it?"
32205,Raj,"come on, leonard, dinner."
33418,Raj,leonard and howard don’t have a flat. they went to the movies. look.
32242,Raj,sure. we’ve both been in his shoes. we’ll let him down with compassion and respect.
29746,Raj,"hey, look at me, i don’t have a foreskin. "
33635,Raj,"then again, he did think you were my husband."
32504,Raj,"but you don’t have sex with her, either."
31161,Raj,maybe. why not? who do i have in my life to watch my figure for?
32820,Raj,"you know what? at least you guys did something. you know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. all guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work."
31081,Raj,"good night, sheldon."
29945,Raj,"i’m curious. in the “how well do you know sheldon” section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?"
32678,Raj,"hey, we’re going to oliver’s house to see his collection. you want to go with us?"
30075,Raj,what if we reposition the collection tank?
29897,Raj,which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
30991,Raj,"don’t worry. everything i have, i share with her. including my friend leon…"
30644,Raj,now can we have cookies and hawaiian punch?
31226,Raj,i had pee his pants.
29797,Raj,"okay, we’re all set."
33708,Raj,"hey, congratulations bert."
30368,Raj,"in fact, it’s better if you don’t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad."
33990,Raj,i’m sorry. what did you want to say?
32109,Raj,"penny, how’s it going over there?"
30710,Raj,"hey guys, guess who i found at lax. my baby sister priya."
32199,Raj,"my father’s a gynaecologist, i think i can handle it. and, now, i’m gay."
31732,Raj,you! always bet on black.
32550,Raj,‘cause that’s what little matzo balls do.
31338,Raj,it was a nice retirement party.
31173,Raj,"tell her it doesn’t matter. tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens."
32511,Raj,eleven. wait. do i count the 200-pound sailor moon girl that howard and i had a threesome with at comic con?
32391,Raj,you’re just saying that.
31582,Raj,when did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
32772,Raj,"ugh, i feel like i’m gonna have a heart attack."
33913,Raj,"here, let me help you."
33216,Raj,ooh!
33241,Raj,still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
30695,Raj,no. it’s too brobdingnagian.
29867,Raj,"not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment."
31378,Raj,it means i like women as well as their skincare products.
30430,Raj,"no, no, no, no, i think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like."
31704,Raj,that is so cool.
33626,Raj,i wonder if this is what it feels like to be bernadette’s baby.
31314,Raj,their meatballs are pretty good.
33586,Raj,so where are we going?
34059,Raj,"it was a tutorial. and yes, i’m happy to keep sheldon company."
30184,Raj,sorry. i lost my cool.
31954,Raj,why? so you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
32441,Raj,"mmm, and you know what that means. someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever."
33236,Raj,oh. what if leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
30303,Raj,what do you want?
31630,Raj,and what does forty-three mean?
32999,Raj,i don’t freaking believe this.
33391,Raj,"good-bye, emily. that was rough, you guys."
33293,Raj,"it is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover."
29774,Raj,i hate trains. 
29724,Raj,"i’ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we’ll put it on my balcony. "
32806,Raj,"thank you. ‘cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings."
32560,Raj,what’s wrong with you?
33097,Raj,"so i have an idea for a filk song. it’s kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions."
33671,Raj,"yes, which is why she was in the telescope room. yes, this is all making sense. good."
31679,Raj,"i understand. in seventh grade, i played spin the bottle and it landed on alina shankar. she said if i came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me."
31113,Raj,what is it to you?
32886,Raj,"oh, no. hey."
31415,Raj,"oh, my goodness. aren’t you the cutest little yorkie ever? you got him for me?"
31284,Raj,what’s your name?
31934,Raj,why would you leave like that?
33282,Raj,"yeah, i calmed her down, but she’s not going to vegas if he’s going."
30783,Raj,your mom creeps the hell out of me.
30751,Raj,"my country ’tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, it’s really great."
33422,Raj,"no, ma’am."
33049,Raj,really?
32112,Raj,"oh, i think we’re doing just fine, thank you."
32226,Raj,"okay, nice talking to you."
30510,Raj,"it’s, it’s not working, dude."
32872,Raj,"so, uh, what game are you… oh. crap."
33448,Raj,"no, i’m actually dating two women. later."
33789,Raj,"material girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song. "
33360,Raj,"even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us."
31094,Raj,this says you can make end of life decisions for me.
31183,Raj,"no, but when i was six years old, i tried to start a boy band called frankie goes to bollywood. but i couldn’t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. wait, when you sign servants, don’t sign it like i’m bragging. sign it in a way that i sound humble with just a hint of, that’s right, i had servants."
32971,Raj,"well, thank you for peeing in my slippers."
33002,Raj,"howard, my father cut me off. i have to get my money back for this."
33692,Raj,"oh, please sit. i tried to cook you a meal from your homeland."
33574,Raj,"well, i think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone."
32748,Raj,actually.
30716,Raj,did you pinky swear?
31413,Raj,"what, you told her?"
32795,Raj,"whether you call it god or the universe or the self, we’re all interconnected, and that’s just a beautiful… son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. s, seriously? you were just gonna drive away? like my life isn’t hard enough right now. a space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs."
31352,Raj,but it says eight a.m.
30296,Raj,"with a woman you were chasing through a park? that’s not a shot, that’s a felony. what’s worse, it cost me my prized patang fighting kite. sheldon, i don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?"
31436,Raj,"anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. uh, you travel through the vineyards. there’s a tasting on board. and all the wild flowers are in bloom. it’s magic."
29967,Raj,"it’s not always your responsibility. i swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week."
30372,Raj,"i don’t think that’s possible, dude."
32537,Raj,got a hot girlfriend now. i want the haters to know.
32432,Raj,"oh, okay, great. but if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about emily."
32077,Raj,as you wish.
33339,Raj,kripke? is that you?
29977,Raj,"and plus, you got a rapid prototyper. that’s an expensive piece of equipment, dude."
33536,Raj,okay.
30520,Raj,no.
31687,Raj,"almost. franken berry, boo berry, sugar bear and the honey nut cheerio bee, i believe his name is buzz."
30502,Raj,"well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. i’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! howard, here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s g-string!"
33847,Raj,don’t worry. everything’s fine.
31120,Raj,"please, come in."
32909,Raj,the lead in the hunger games is a woman. marvel has made tor a female.
31615,Raj,it’s the atomic number for technetium.
34037,Raj,why did you even go to dinner with the guy?
32160,Raj,wonder what she saw in that guy.
34075,Raj,i could have made her very happy.
31756,Raj,"dumped her? what, did he use a forklift? sorry. there’s nothing funny about morbid obesity."
32922,Raj,"what, and that’s not offensive? where’s the line?"
31597,Raj,he is kind of a weirdo. maybe he’s got leonard nimoy chained up in there. or bill gates. or stephen hawking.
33607,Raj,hello?
30912,Raj,nice place. reminds me of my parents’ house back in new delhi.
31773,Raj,"they’re on the chair, right over… oy vey."
32181,Raj,"hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back."
32862,Raj,"uh, origin of species."
30016,Raj,"you heard that, ladies’ night ladies? we’re eventually coming for you!"
32878,Raj,hang on.
31965,Raj,"yeah, thank you! this means a lot to me. my friends are like my family. unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me."
33869,Raj,"yeah, it was. but it’s my father’s money and i’m mad at him."
34050,Raj,why?
33220,Raj,good for sheldon deciding to stay with amy on her birthday.
32650,Raj,i’m sweating already.
30478,Raj,"no, that’s okay. i’ll get it."
32842,Raj,"no, stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own."
29874,Raj,"oh, pause it. that’s it. confirmed. we now have the address of the top model house."
31141,Raj,i’ll see you around.
34119,Raj,like the wild elephant i am trumpeting my love for you!
21789,Raj,why?
32443,Raj,"wh, what happened?"
33210,Raj,"yeah, like she could get trent."
33594,Raj,what? no.
29807,Raj,"sorry, it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from new delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to america to reach for the stars."
31924,Raj,"mm, yeah. those are both toughies."
30277,Raj,"dude, you have to stop talking like that. it’s really lame."
31259,Raj,"so, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?"
32216,Raj,you mean like fatties and uggos?
31410,Raj,i can’t believe your attitude. i thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
32019,Raj,"hmm. uh, let me see something. "
31165,Raj,i don’t know if i want to play anymore.
32757,Raj,"don’t blow too hard. if you pop him, i will vomit."
33368,Raj,"what? he beat out george clooney, and that’s something. like, i love me some clooney."
29968,Raj,i didn’t bring it up. you did.
32594,Raj,hey.
29524,Raj,it’s fantastic. unbelievable.
30046,Raj,what? no. ..
33370,Raj,"yeah, of course."
30248,Raj,that’s the only logical inference.
31180,Raj,great. then she won’t know i’m lying.
34147,Raj,"no, never. what is porn?"
30643,Raj,"next time, take your own advice."
33279,Raj,"no, come on, please don’t leave."
29721,Raj,my turn.
32965,Raj,bees talk to each other by dancing. whales have their songs.
30928,Raj,"yeah, but you were just sleeping, because i forboded you to have sex."
29951,Raj,we could eat after the movie.
29704,Raj,two.
33412,Raj,good talk.
33154,Raj,that is so generous of you. i’d like to switch sides.
32474,Raj,"before you go, at least let me pack you some attack of the scones for the road."
33646,Raj,eating cake on the toilet single. 
33504,Raj,"uh, it’s tonight, but it’s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line."
32940,Raj,"but technically, yes."
32762,Raj,"mmm. amy, that pudding was delicious."
31658,Raj,"uh, wait, can i come with you? my character died."
33473,Raj,"okay. oh, how about this? stuart’s dressed like a brother of the night’s watch, and they don’t have sex."
32061,Raj,"attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!"
32099,Raj,"oh, please?"
30733,Raj,i can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
33297,Raj,"well, astrophysicist."
31608,Raj,what if it’s booby-trapped?
30841,Raj,and nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
33776,Raj,be there bright and early.
32614,Raj,cool. i’ll make the popcorn.
31106,Raj,it’s my sister. can we not talk about this any more?
30295,Raj,"you always do this, you know? you ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with."
30806,Raj,"five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?"
29987,Raj,"sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?"
30891,Raj,what kind of needs?
29676,Raj,maybe we’re too smart. so smart it’s offputting. 
33105,Raj,"right, yeah, right. but, what do you think?"
31848,Raj,it would be nice to have the increased income. stop taking money from my parents.
30848,Raj,i don’t want to be aquaman. he sucks. he sucks underwater. he sucks fish pee.
33636,Raj,"hey, show her the trunk. show her the trunk."
32310,Raj,"oh, of course."
32743,Raj,yup. bye.
30212,Raj,you want me to work with you?
30934,Raj,she says it the same way i do. i’d love that. everybody in india says it that way. it’s not a big deal.
31207,Raj,"oh, penny, i hurt so bad."
31401,Raj,"thankyou. and once again, my baloney likes girls. wait-wait. you don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. yeah, okay, that time i heard it."
33562,Raj,"wow. you’re going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. now i know how all those army wives feel."
31964,Raj,"come on. don’t make me beg. and i’m from india, so i know how to do it."
32668,Raj,oh. is it amy?
33935,Raj,"oh, uh, hi, penny. yes, please."
32046,Raj,"okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time."
32621,Raj,"plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work."
31857,Raj,"excuse me. i’m here to pay my respects to professor tupperware, or whatever his name is."
33502,Raj,why would you do that? i specifically asked you not to do that.
29539,Raj,you might be bound by them right now.
33948,Raj,"howard? howard? it’s me, it’s just me. "
31252,Raj,"hey, guys, check it out. the deluxe limited edition wild west and witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin."
30524,Raj,what?
30829,Raj,"no, it’s chilly outside. didn’t bring my jacket."
29978,Raj,"sheldon, you have two choices. either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the tivo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town."
34010,Raj,"oh, quick, sit."
30314,Raj,"oh, why can’t i stay mad at you?"
31382,Raj,"listen, i love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here."
33972,Raj,it’s nice to see you taking an interest in amy’s work.
32438,Raj,"hey, guys."
34181,Raj,you’ll need a good attention span.
32125,Raj,"well, it was fun. i used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. it’s a lightsabre belt buckle."
33401,Raj,that’s exactly what she said. how do you know that?
30400,Raj,oy.
30811,Raj,"well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero."
32892,Raj,thank you for forgiving me.
30222,Raj,"sheldon, for god’s sakes, don’t make me beg."
31706,Raj,great idea. i haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. these cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before i eat a pretzel and they’re gone.
33229,Raj,and we’ve built it up in our heads so much.
30673,Raj,has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture? if you look at neutron scattering data…
30079,Raj,"me, too."
32990,Raj,"mm. hello, daddy. what’s up?"
31595,Raj,i’m listening.
30185,Raj,"okay, here’s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-neptunian objects ran into a dead end."
32643,Raj,so where should we do it?
32683,Raj,you think he bites?
30325,Raj,"well, that was rather unpleasant."
30781,Raj,how do you know that?
31639,Raj,"hey, got a minute?"
30203,Raj,"that’s very good. jolly amusing, but if you don’t mind, i’ll hold off until sunset on titan."
29659,Raj,"well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to sheldon?"
32472,Raj,and if you’re not in the mood for coffee i can always make you a chai tea-3po.
31556,Raj,"oh, by the way, can i borrow your bullwhip and fedora?"
31746,Raj,are you sure you want to do this? give up your half of the 3-d printer?
32715,Raj,"pretty good. she bought the book eat, pray, love and used it to set my father’s mercedes on fire. so, what’s up with you guys?"
31989,Raj,i will. you can download my paper on the van allen belts from the university server as well.
30965,Raj,"good, because i would hate that."
33989,Raj,i’m a good listener.
30556,Raj,i’ve missed you.
33916,Raj,that’s fine. she and i can cry together.
29963,Raj,"if anybody cares, i still have to pee."
32070,Raj,i was wrong. this is worse.
31936,Raj,"yeah, well, i like you a lot, and that’s scary for me. mostly because you’re a proven flight risk."
31200,Raj,"yeah, that’s good. keep telling yourself that. "
31359,Raj,we were badass back in the day.
32228,Raj,hey. good to see you.
33369,Raj,thank you. that’s why i say keaton’s number one. he brought a sense of humour to the role.
33306,Raj,"hey, it’s not my fault if american women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes."
31041,Raj,it’s a beautiful country. you’d love it. may i join you?
33065,Raj,"well, you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend."
33590,Raj,"bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? you’re gonna be an amazing mom. even if you don’t believe it, i know you have maternal instincts."
29782,Raj,how dare you. aishwarya rai is a goddess. by comparison madhuri dixit is a leprous prostitute.
33248,Raj,"okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected, we’ll know what it is that we found."
32538,Raj,"wow. how’s that hater-ade taste, bro? hey, this isn’t the way to work."
30444,Raj,thank you.
33337,Raj,"yes. whenever things are going well, i always find a way to ruin it. you two look happy, how do you do it?"
32424,Raj,"yeah, literally, none of it."
32900,Raj,"you don’t want to do that. refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. what? i saw a teachable moment. i dropped some culinary science."
30026,Raj,interesting. are you a droid?
33142,Raj,you may want to leave the room.
30099,Raj,it was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
32307,Raj,do you think this is cool?
33698,Raj,"no, p-please don’t."
32146,Raj,"this is all your fault, i should’ve listened to mun-mun because i’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is penny. why are you so cruel? do you enjoy my pain?"
33924,Raj,i cannot thank you enough.
33296,Raj,"yeah, i get that. i’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist."
30082,Raj,we could play outside.
33187,Raj,"no, i was in india, it was humid and smelled funny."
32722,Raj,"when stuff like this gets me down, you know what i like to do?"
33715,Raj,"it’s a human emotion, sheldon. everyone gets jealous. i’m jealous of leonard and penny and howard and bernadette for being in such happy relationships."
31451,Raj,"dude, i am so sorry."
32236,Raj,"padma kapur, neha chowdury."
31518,Raj,okay.
29707,Raj,a time share time machine? i’m in. sheldon?
29998,Raj,non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh 
34074,Raj,she’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.
31146,Raj,"please, penny, let me. we’ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower."
31764,Raj,hello?
29745,Raj,"why should i back off, you back off dude."
33618,Raj,so how’s your apartment?
33209,Raj,"from there, it was easy to find him on instagram, snapchat and pretty much track his every movement."
29680,Raj,"how come on star trek everybody’s private parts are the same. no alien lady ever told captain kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose. "
32162,Raj,stir the gravy. 
33862,Raj,"i know you are. that’s why you just bought me a new ipad. and before you start, i am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me."
33995,Raj,"i don’t know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove."
31757,Raj,"dude, i’m a single man. saturday night is my party night."
32910,Raj,"you know, tor, the god of tunder. as i was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?"
31636,Raj,why do you have a parking spot? you don’t have a car. you don’t even drive.
33503,Raj,did you guys see there’s an avengers screening? joss whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.
30843,Raj,a milk dud?
30470,Raj,"fantastic four, daredevil, invincible iron man, happy hogan, curt connors…"
31398,Raj,"that’s unbreakable by khloe and lamar. and for your information, it’s unisex."
32624,Raj,that cannot be true.
33726,Raj,"well, they already had a village."
31874,Raj,thanks a lot.
31003,Raj,no. it’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. like when the three of us went to the movies and you and i waited outside the bathroom while howard threw up red vines and cherry coke. do you remember that?
32439,Raj,"emily, these are my good friends, howard and bernadette. guys, this is emily."
31774,Raj,you were right. i can’t get out of here.
29571,Raj,i’m all out. 
32066,Raj,"dude, this is, this is brutal. "
33244,Raj,"yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours."
30976,Raj,"hello, priya. what’s up? how would i know if leonard’s at work or not? don’t be suspicious. look, if you want your relationship with leonard to continue, you’re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. okay? yeah, bye-bye. you owe me."
31210,Raj,"look, penny, you’re great, but i had a long talk with my parents, and they said if i date an indian girl, i get a maserati."
31854,Raj,i don’t know.
31283,Raj,"hey, i let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy.  hello?"
33931,Raj,"okay, well, if i move in, you can’t use mine. hold on a second. hey, howard, uh, how’s the wi-fi in the garage?"
32262,Raj,you know i struggle with batman.
32182,Raj,"oh, what did i do?"
32372,Raj,or is sherlock holmes the english byomkesh bakshi?
30385,Raj,"what you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at mario kart."
33234,Raj,"well, i should warn you, it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen."
30412,Raj,"not so loud, but ideally, yes. thanks."
31254,Raj,please. you’re looking at facebook to find out how their date went.
31082,Raj,you’re kidding.
29728,Raj,"oh, i call dibs on the golden age flash."
34120,Raj,my heart burns for you like the sun at noon!
30711,Raj,can you believe it? little priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in india.
33879,Raj,i don’t want to say because i don’t know how much it is.
32394,Raj,"hey. emily, right?"
32354,Raj,"hello, emily."
32744,Raj,"hey, what’s going on?"
33865,Raj,i can’t believe what i’m hearing. this is deeply hurtful.
30633,Raj,and it only took 28 minutes.
32889,Raj,yeah.
29849,Raj,"here you go, cute huh?"
32460,Raj,i do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.
29965,Raj,"nope, i think mocking you is more fun."
32081,Raj,you want a tums?
31672,Raj,it’s true. i’m always attracted to women i can’t have. i do it all the time. i did the same thing with the two of you.
31377,Raj,"no, i’m not gay. if anything, i’m metrosexual."
33329,Raj,"well, you say it like it’s easy. have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?"
30440,Raj,sheesh.
31970,Raj,"that’s, that’s very nice of you. uh, come, come. come on in."
31591,Raj,"i don’t know, i’m torn. i want to know where he’s going, but now i kind of want to play with the bunny."
32521,Raj,"okay. please. so, uh, you, you have tattoos?"
31883,Raj,"good, black is more slimming. oh, that’s her. i got to go be butch. toodles. hey."
32272,Raj,"since you two are gonna be around for valentine’s, would you mind watching cinnamon?"
31738,Raj,"oh, true. they’re practically giving them away. you know, in exchange for money."
33331,Raj,"oh, i’m gonna do a pre-cry before i go in there. really dry myself out."
31323,Raj,they don’t call me brown dynamite for nothing.
29545,Raj,"excuse me, ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and shiva is the destroyer. when the smoke clears, abraham lincoln will be speaking hindi and drinking mint juleps. "
31533,Raj,we’re not kicking him out. stuart and i have become good friends.
32763,Raj,"if you people think this is better than tom hanks-giving, you’re all crazy."
31216,Raj,"hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the borg queen in first contact?"
32812,Raj,did he respond yet?
32255,Raj,does he sound like a criminal?
30563,Raj,doesn’t have to be asian.
32189,Raj,hey.
31045,Raj,"oh, derived from the word angel. appropriate."
34139,Raj,it’s locked.
30482,Raj,name one.
31707,Raj,"and we’re blending, and we’re blending, and we’re done."
31714,Raj,wool pants in the desert. i feel like i’ve got poached testicles.
32378,Raj,"yeah, i was. i was 200 pounds by the time i was in middle school. kids were mean. cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. anyway, i was pretty lonely, so i had to make up my own stories and games, and i promised myself if i ever made any friends that, that i would play those games with them."
31997,Raj,"i’d like to apologize for being insensitive. and for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys."
30970,Raj,i totally had one of those.
31423,Raj,"three times. he begged the fox network not to cancel firefly. he begged the tnt network to cancel babylon 5. and when he got food poisoning at the rose bowl parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly."
30389,Raj,i don’t want to do that.
30897,Raj,"it’ll be okay. it’ll be okay.  it’s howard. howard, hello."
34070,Raj,"actually, i was going to suggest me."
34031,Raj,"if you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak hindi."
33634,Raj,"though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan."
32764,Raj,"oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god."
31406,Raj,"she was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. and you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but i’m actually thinking about doing it."
30413,Raj,you help me run my game.
33662,Raj,thank you. good luck with your future endeavours.
30914,Raj,"more than we can use. you see, in india, we don’t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams."
30584,Raj,"maybe, but i don’t care. that’s the great thing about nyquil, it’s like ten-percent booze. i call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine."
32508,Raj,what? don’t send me home. i can’t be alone right now.
33394,Raj,thank you.
29572,Raj,there are no rules in hell! 
33442,Raj,wow.
32405,Raj,"oh, my goodness."
33839,Raj,"no, no. i will take care of it."
31656,Raj,"but, a cannon? am i really out of the game?"
32254,Raj,how are you gonna get james earl jones?
32585,Raj,"ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place."
31467,Raj,"howard and bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers."
33838,Raj,whoa. just trying to help.
33300,Raj,"yeah, great."
29685,Raj,maybe so. but you can’t incinerate a bengal tiger with a magnifying glass. 
32857,Raj,"so, what do you guys want to do?"
33774,Raj,"oh, don’t take it so personally, maybe your baby’s just a jerk."
33525,Raj,i’d like to think the four on your side guy cares about me.
31624,Raj,how did you get your hands on that?
32868,Raj,"okay, cool. oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while i’m here alone, right? ‘cause that’ll be awkward."
32423,Raj,i know. being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
32755,Raj,"what do you mean, not again?"
31339,Raj,"hey, look, there’s rothman’s empty office. sad."
33197,Raj,"yeah, we totally did."
31396,Raj,"why me, of all people?"
30190,Raj,yeah let me start practicing for it. do you want fries with that maharaja mac?”
30728,Raj,"i… i don’t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust."
31959,Raj,"i want to apologize for amy last night. she was completely out of line. are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?"
32487,Raj,all right. now what?
30182,Raj,"yeah, maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls."
29600,Raj,why?
30324,Raj,"oh, dude, i wish you had said something before i pounded that last red bull."
33912,Raj,"yeah, you’d think. ooh, maybe i could sell my blood and sperm."
33169,Raj,37 minutes left until the deadline.
34056,Raj,"anyway, uh, as i was saying, i was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasn’t for friends"
30856,Raj,you know what’s a great app? the one that makes fart noises.
32850,Raj,"you guys are really being calm about penny and sheldon doing this thing. if it were me i’d, i’d be a little nervous."
30302,Raj,it’s open.
33892,Raj,"yeah, that’s right. keep asking yourself that. but i still love you very much, so don’t cut me out of the will."
33359,Raj,it’s a good sign.
31127,Raj,"i was wondering if you’re free friday. they’re having a totally ’80s night at the greek. hall & oates, katrina and the waves and three-fifths of kajagoogoo."
33465,Raj,"fine, i don’t want to watch with you either. i’ll go over here."
32985,Raj,"he’s right. if you think about it, we’re all in charge."
31385,Raj,"oh, yes. you must be lakshmi. uh, nice to meet you."
30507,Raj,think about this. the only way your mother was born was your meemaw had sex.
29950,Raj,what about the multiplex here? the seats are terrific.
31843,Raj,"yeah,"
32539,Raj,i thought stuart was looking after her.
33556,Raj,my cousin does work in a call centre.
32794,Raj,"sorry. you’re right. i’m so stressed. but you know what, whenever i walk into that temple i realize that whatever happens, it’s okay. we’re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can’t understand it, we can be happy to know that it’s, it’s working its will through us."
33242,Raj,now i’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
30054,Raj,if you’re really a prostitute.
33455,Raj,"oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. can’t even remember what that’s like."
33810,Raj,"okay, uh, let’s get things started. um, why don’t we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. want to kick it off?"
31292,Raj,"no need. i’ve already done that. siri, do you have a last name?"
34102,Raj,"that’s the spirit, howard. yes, we can."
29936,Raj,"come on, sheldon, you got this."
30947,Raj,okay.
31480,Raj,yoo-hoo! over here!
29658,Raj,"as it turns out, yes."
31125,Raj,"hi, amy. can i talk to penny?"
32247,Raj,and i told you i get diaper rash.
32406,Raj,i just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend lucy. she misses me and wants to get together.
34155,Raj,"yes. okay. i, i understand. of course, yes. i’ll call you tomorrow. bye."
29925,Raj,"i’m not surprised. despite his hard and crusty shell, howard is a very sensitive man. do you know he writes poetry? mostly about men from nantucket and hermits named dave, but he does it with real sensitivity."
33020,Raj,"hey, i don’t even live here."
29820,Raj,"so anyway, after a fantastic lunch i was whisked off to the people magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?"
33072,Raj,we can drive there.
32680,Raj,how did you get it?
29931,Raj,"sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile."
30762,Raj,"well i earned it, dude, i ate all my broccoli."
33542,Raj,that’s what he said to me.
33799,Raj,"sheldon, when i said i was fine, i meant i didn’t want to talk about it any more."
31979,Raj,"uh, no, water’s fine. anyhow, i’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and i totally see why lucy did what she did. i pushed too hard. but you know what? if i back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…"
32670,Raj,the space probe.
34100,Raj,it’s hot in here. must be summer.
33937,Raj,it’s the least i can do for helping me carry my stuff up.
31833,Raj,"dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party."
31246,Raj,i’ll take one.
30982,Raj,don’t say your doom. who opens the door for their doom?
33083,Raj,"if this was star trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off."
33439,Raj,can i squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
32020,Raj,"oh. sorry, sorry, uh, okay.  i mean, yeah, maybe."
30257,Raj,"oh, so that’s how it works? i have a teeny bladder and now i don’t get a hot girlfriend?"
33622,Raj,"it’s okay. it’s by choice. well, their choice, and it’s not okay."
34167,Raj,hello?
32661,Raj,we should have asked her to get some funyuns.
30367,Raj,"i was on the radio once. i called in to fever 104 fm new delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, “fever 104, आज के नये अच्छे संगीत का घर.” that means: “fever 104, home of the really good current music.” it’s much catchier in hindi."
32831,Raj,"don’t say that. i mean, you’re not dame judi dench, but you’re pretty great."
33842,Raj,under the careful supervision of her godfather.
31373,Raj,who are you bringing?
33620,Raj,"if you ever need somewhere to crash, there’s always my place."
30752,Raj,"well, actually, i may have gotten a little tipsy when i talked to her."
32972,Raj,"look, i know you guys are upset, but we’ve talked about it, and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project."
29876,Raj,i don’t want to watch saturn 3. deep space nine is better.
31494,Raj,what? why?
33357,Raj,they have that. it’s called uber.
33728,Raj,i’m here to put the crib together.
29891,Raj,"okay, who gets the extra dumpling?"
33059,Raj,and i’m just hearing about this now?
31051,Raj,sorry. walking tree.
33547,Raj,"okay, that’s not so bad. you know what happened to the scientists that worked on the manhattan project? the government forced them to move to the desert. they had to live in secret, and when oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation."
33750,Raj,"well, okay, i’m gonna sign off now. this next part may contain some adult language."
32852,Raj,"well, that’s what the bullies at bruce lee’s high school thought. and then, bam. karate."
30566,Raj,"but we’ll have sex first, right?"
31091,Raj,"he’s right. a minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips."
29904,Raj,hey.
31247,Raj,wild bill witchcock.
30747,Raj,"of course not. i’m here on an h-1b visa, which means i can’t be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. and i’m not."
31659,Raj,"ooh! girls’ night, girls’ night! ooh! ooh!"
31043,Raj,"we’re scientists. we observe everything. here, go buy yourself a scone."
32735,Raj,"anyway, dad’s gonna be here in town, so i won’t be able to do christmas dinner this year."
30766,Raj,"we can still see something. uh, the new sandra bullock movie is playing two blocks away. you know sandy b always brings it."
33724,Raj,although it was already under control.
33843,Raj,"like i said, you ladies have fun."
32758,Raj,it’s a christmas miracle.
29872,Raj,and a large number of people will believe it never happened.
33061,Raj,"i don’t know, but i’d like to get lost in her bermuda triangle."
32198,Raj,"oh, man, that is so us."
29801,Raj,"ah, yes, online gaming addiction. there’s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back."
32617,Raj,"oh, i have an idea."
32653,Raj,how you feeling?
29542,Raj,"oh, god, look at this buffet. i love america."
32533,Raj,"sure, of course. oh, actually, emily was gonna spend the night."
30812,Raj,"who wouldn’t? you could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. and the best part is, if i were rat-man, you could be my sidekick, mouse boy."
31485,Raj,"it’s your anniversary? oh, my god, i had no idea. amy, please, let me make this right. "
33954,Raj,"you know, we’re both down on our luck. maybe you and i should try to get a place together."
32576,Raj,you guys kiss and hold hands.
31877,Raj,"well, that doesn’t seem fair."
32811,Raj,what does it say?
34186,Raj,that’s pretty.
32571,Raj,is it too late for him to cancel?
33053,Raj,and you didn’t think to tell me?
33967,Raj,"hey, can i ask you a favour? would you mind taking cinnamon for a walk?"
30211,Raj,no.
31600,Raj,"i don’t want to be a ninja, i want to be a cat burglar."
33868,Raj,"yeah, it’s a crushed velvet baby cape."
29661,Raj,she was sleeping with you?
33796,Raj,"that’s okay, i’m fine."
29741,Raj,have you ever heard of the kama sutra? 
32500,Raj,thanks for skipping the movie. i couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about emily and that guy.
32131,Raj,"no. oh, is he anything like, uh, mun-mun the mongoose? he taught us not to play with cobras."
29655,Raj,the… the picture’s breaking up. 
33507,Raj,"boy, all this standing’s making me tired. good thing i brought my collapsible stick chair."
30895,Raj,what happened?
29669,Raj,"okay, so not her either. how about her?"
34049,Raj,you could try saying that without smiling.
30574,Raj,i’m sorry?
30885,Raj,"thank you, but cute is for bunnies. i want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle."
30530,Raj,fine. you’re in sheldon square.
30887,Raj,"well, thanks, bernadette. and just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander."
31044,Raj,and what is your name?
31729,Raj,they’re here. our action figures have arrived. this is the best five hundred dollars i’ve ever spent.
32818,Raj,"come on, sheldon!"
32828,Raj,so should we go talk to him?
30034,Raj,"what do you say, howard?"
33167,Raj,this is exciting.
33663,Raj,"oh, no, that’s mine."
30754,Raj,"ah, me, too."
29911,Raj,then how?
29722,Raj,my turn! 
33259,Raj,"yeah, s-so it’s, like, kooper with a k?"
29943,Raj,"yeah, he’s a ginormous knob."
33614,Raj,maybe howard and bernadette said i could be here.
33640,Raj,"howard, howard, look at the dvd screen. i put on batman: the animated series. your favourite."
33273,Raj,"yeah, that sounds fun. a party-bus party don’t stop. ooh, when i say party, you say bus."
33116,Raj,that had nothing to do with rachel. it was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.
32732,Raj,and we still don’t know who framed him.
29652,Raj,"would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?"
32009,Raj,"well, i’ve been quite enjoying that. it combines all the superhero fun of spider-man with all the body-switching shenanigans of freaky friday. both versions, original and lohan."
31873,Raj,do you think i’m feminine?
33743,Raj,12 minutes.
31280,Raj,i will take that action.
34013,Raj,"oh, grow up."
32983,Raj,"look, i’m sorry i hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over."
31049,Raj,check it! howard pulls one out from under the bridge. nice!
31215,Raj,sure.
31024,Raj,what?
33466,Raj,"okay, then you go there."
31379,Raj,"‘cause i, i’m tired of trying to meet someone and, i think i’d like you to help me find uh, a wife."
34023,Raj,i feel bad for bert.
33670,Raj,"yes, in the telescope room."
31014,Raj,this is it.
34154,Raj,they’re in my shirt. they’re in my shirt. they’re in my shirt.
31683,Raj,thank you. i hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.
33882,Raj,not really.
33285,Raj,"oh, god."
30446,Raj,"well, if anyone’s interested, i’ll be spending this valentine’s day the same way i spend every valentine’s day. buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal."
31532,Raj,the fantastic four reunited.
32227,Raj,"well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join."
30140,Raj,what happened?
32803,Raj,and you think that’s going to help?
33343,Raj,i’m sorry for bothering you. i’ll hang up now.
30552,Raj,let me ask you a question. do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
31147,Raj,sorry. go on.
34124,Raj,who is it?
29838,Raj,that’s what you’re wearing.
30817,Raj,"i don’t know. um, nuclear war. accidentally being buried alive. any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die, and then you do."
32454,Raj,"hey. listen to this. murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await."
31291,Raj,i bet it is. why don’t women like me?
32779,Raj,"hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company."
31170,Raj,"ah, look at that. i have a date. i love america again."
30230,Raj,"no, no, no, no! that rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?"
31901,Raj,and it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
31122,Raj,i’m sorry.
31799,Raj,"no. i took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me."
29708,Raj,did the listing actually say miniature?
30688,Raj,no.
31233,Raj,"totally. what’s wrong with cap sleeves? if you have the right figure for it, they’re adorable."
31847,Raj,"yeah, me neither. it should be about the work. and if i can’t get tenure, i’d like to see you or sheldon get it."
31012,Raj,wow. i can’t believe old smelly pooper finally got laid.
30608,Raj,"that’s disgusting, dude."
29748,Raj,"i’m not happy, it’s the medication, i can’t stop smiling. "
31275,Raj,"if they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play leonard’s mother? sandra bullock."
30394,Raj,no. we would just walk around and see what’s what.
30809,Raj,did he get superpowers?
33342,Raj,"rich parents, don’t forget, rich parents."
30640,Raj,"a-all right, um, how about this. when, when winnie the pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled."
31317,Raj,buzz lightyear is not real.
32726,Raj,the doorman said this is the right building.
30120,Raj,"okay, who had leonard gets a floppy disk?"
33672,Raj,mm-hmm.
33481,Raj,"hey, claire."
30300,Raj,"it’s not just the kite thing. every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don’t have a shot with them."
32788,Raj,"well, lots of scientists believe in god. okay? newton, uh, faraday, uh, pascal, all were believers. even einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that god does not play dice with the universe."
33417,Raj,i need to rub my genitals on their prototype.
32482,Raj,maybe we should see how he’s doing.
33333,Raj,"you’re right, let’s talk again in a few days."
30494,Raj,i’m signing off now.
30178,Raj,but we don’t have tattoos. what if someone asks to see our tattoos?
30395,Raj,"okay, well, how about this? from the university web site, 7pm to 10pm, norton hall multipurpose room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be."
30946,Raj,okay.
33835,Raj,"yeah, right. wait, is it rose gold? actually, don’t tell me, i want to be surprised."
33656,Raj,good point. and you are?
30417,Raj,"well, i’m a slumdog astrophysicist."
33050,Raj,"yeah. come on, i’ll give you a ride."
30121,Raj,"just fine? oh, dude, the fourth harry potter movie was just fine."
32587,Raj,we are now.
32225,Raj,"uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?"
30523,Raj,"true, but thanks to meditation, i am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. now, close your eyes."
32128,Raj,not even to sleep?
29783,Raj,tag. you’re it.  
33906,Raj,but you charged me hundreds for this stuff.
33091,Raj,"oh, we could play filk music."
34182,Raj,that’s equally effective.
33873,Raj,my father thinks the reason i can’t make a relationship work is because i’m spoiled.
32212,Raj,i don’t see why not. 
33217,Raj,"no, never heard of ’em!"
31446,Raj,"the only threesome i’ve ever had in my life, and i’m proud to say it was with this man right here."
33089,Raj,i don’t know. maybe jughead’s a terminator.
29625,Raj,but you’re not princess punchali.
31682,Raj,but you’re not alone anymore. now you’ve got sheldon.
32687,Raj,one ladder left.
30146,Raj,i think we’re fitting in quite nicely.
32050,Raj,"wait, how can, how can anyone ruin raiders? it’s perfect."
33558,Raj,is it even possible to get this done in two months?
31497,Raj,"yeah, no. but yet, here you two are, still together. and that’s even after you and i had our crazy naked night."
33270,Raj,i wish we could do more stuff without sheldon.
32769,Raj,space ice is no joke. i can’t even watch frozen anymore.
33036,Raj,you guys are being jerks.
30503,Raj,"i think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. from what i know about these things, if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time, it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies."
30615,Raj,"yeah, look. breasts and everything."
32797,Raj,"oh, good. namaste, grandpa."
30773,Raj,is that racist? it feels racist.
33316,Raj,"right. good catch. anyway, so i’m sorry to waste your time. and, uh, and good luck with your screenplay."
33276,Raj,"yeah, but he doesn’t mean it."
30879,Raj,"certainly. i’d like to raise two points. number one, i think they are talking about penises. and number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass."
30736,Raj,i got you a talking thomas the tank engine for thanksgiving.
30801,Raj,nothing happened. can we please just change the subject?
33988,Raj,"but when you’re insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe."
30691,Raj,"i have three brothers and two sisters, sheldon, i can do this all day."
30637,Raj,you slipped and fell into a robot hand?
32773,Raj,i can’t stop thinking about it.
33355,Raj,"uh, it’s in the corner."
30575,Raj,no.
33413,Raj,hey. where are the guys?
31462,Raj,"yes, you made that brutally clear to me. what i was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until sunday morning, the google satellite will be over pasadena. you can have a wedding photograph from space."
30651,Raj,it’s a potty. what do you call it?
29994,Raj,"actually, in india, the names of constellations are different. where you have the big dipper, we have the big curry pot."
32113,Raj,"ah, i’m making a necklace for my mom. "
32377,Raj,"well, i guess it goes back to when i was a fat kid in india, and didn’t have any friends."
31861,Raj,"well, now it’s biguous. what are you gonna do about it?"
31686,Raj,"i did the research. tony the tiger, dig’em the frog, cap’n crunch, toucan sam, count chocula, trix the rabbit, snap, crackle and pop. not one cereal mascot is a girl. it’s a total breakfast sausage fest."
30557,Raj,"hey, leonard?"
29657,Raj,"do you know what he did. he watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me. "
33922,Raj,"i’ve been plenty of times. if i miss one, it’s fine. i’m a big boy."
32403,Raj,"it is. but once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion."
33195,Raj,but someone joined our page. we have an actual fan.
29991,Raj,"and that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that’s venus."
31301,Raj,"hey, don’t talk to her like that. she’s a lady."
31197,Raj,the best one i ever had!
33517,Raj,"okay, look, i’m on the air force web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. so maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention."
33185,Raj,"you’re in a soup kitchen, not a production of oliver!"
32686,Raj,"okay, now you’re messing with me."
34060,Raj,"oh, why does he need a ladder?"
30909,Raj,sounds great!
31476,Raj,"hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, i heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. i don’t need to tell you in los angeles, sandal season is year round."
33471,Raj,"well, howard eating that pistachio was like when king joffrey got poisoned."
32064,Raj,"in the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. how many of them have sent us messages?"
29528,Raj,"also, the pretty girl left."
31263,Raj,that’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
33866,Raj,hello.
33261,Raj,"wait, what happened to us?"
29597,Raj,can you believe how pushy she is?
30102,Raj,we have to tell him.
30659,Raj,"ooh, somebody’s been taking bitchy pills."
31218,Raj,"i couldn’t find you guys so i bought six new friends. three, sadly, are dead."
32427,Raj,"she had mixed feelings. but when i said, emily was cool with it. emily’s the best. why can’t you"
32611,Raj,"for your information, emily is working tonight."
32725,Raj,or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.
32659,Raj,"so, as hannah montana, miley was a world-famous pop star. but then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. which, i don’t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache."
32592,Raj,great.
31243,Raj,"they’re not even trying. remember the satanimals pack with the hellephant? why, absurd. what was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? what could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?"
33686,Raj,"oh, yes. oh, okay. uh, good night. i don’t know, maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes, but i feel like something is happening between us."
30238,Raj,okay. here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
31046,Raj,"wait, where are you going? we were doing so well. she never even got to see my penis. ta-da!"
33163,Raj,"yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. if we present him as a prize, maybe they would."
31987,Raj,"thanks. oh, sheldon, since amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?"
33921,Raj,it doesn’t matter. i’m not keeping this. i’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. taking handouts won’t help that.
30915,Raj,i think we were misled about the cute girls.
31298,Raj,i haven’t bonded with it.
31461,Raj,"well, i know how to make it special."
31305,Raj,"oh, my god, kenny g? this woman can read me like a book. i can’t believe i bought my soul mate at glendale galleria."
31408,Raj,"it’s a great deal. we both get our parents off our backs. i don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once i’m married, i can finally eat carbs again and let myself go."
33314,Raj,"come on, i just told you i had a girlfriend. the least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe."
33140,Raj,you know he won’t be looking at other girls.
32309,Raj,"um, okay. first off, know that we all love you and cherish you."
30937,Raj,"hey, you’re just in time. we made tex-mex."
32231,Raj,"yeah, grow up, howard. god."
31020,Raj,i need a hug.
30489,Raj,"gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?"
31119,Raj,"that could have been about anyone. besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now i’m the dusky half of koothrapenny."
31648,Raj,"no. but if you catch anything, i know how to steam it in banana leaves."
30661,Raj,"oh, god, never again."
32473,Raj,"hey, uh, sheldon, you want anything?"
32589,Raj,we were having a conversation about past lovers.
33627,Raj,"well, it’s getting late. maybe we should head home."
30027,Raj,do you kind of look like a shiny sheldon?
32252,Raj,we would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.
34123,Raj,"dance number aside, i’m so not gay."
33829,Raj,"yeah. well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip."
32481,Raj,"mm, true. i do feel guilty about him."
31112,Raj,hey.
33028,Raj,"i guess i’m just more of a pottery barn, crate and barrel kind of guy. maybe pier 1 if i really want to cut loose."
32220,Raj,"yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. you know, maybe talking to people is too hard."
31055,Raj,i know.
33694,Raj,"so, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to america?"
33207,Raj,"hey, dude, trent just checked in at the coffee shop on fair oaks."
30271,Raj,"okay, i get it, he’s a bad guy. sign here."
33956,Raj,"no, you see, i’m doing this so i can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person."
29588,Raj,"if you don’t want to meddle, then why are you meddling."
29979,Raj,"whatever it is, i’m guessing we’re doing it wrong."
30169,Raj,we’re both frauds.
31641,Raj,"howard, that’s not how we practiced it."
32265,Raj,are you impressed by that?
30636,Raj,"what would a toilet look like in atlantis? how would you flush it? and when you did flush it, where would the poop go?"
30830,Raj,"what kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights."
31386,Raj,"oh, uh, these are my, my friends. this is bernadette."
30263,Raj,what about the money?
33144,Raj,i had a great time last night.
31088,Raj,sheldon doesn’t get along with sheldon. it’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
32306,Raj,"that’s the dynamic, i’m the fun one, you’re the buzzkill."
30157,Raj,"oh, we’re scientists."
32313,Raj,"howard, i’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts."
30173,Raj,"i like it, i like it. did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?"
29910,Raj,"“kandorian dry cl…” i give up, you can’t have a rational argument with this man."
31319,Raj,"okay, um, how about crash”? howard “crash” wolowitz."
30625,Raj,"but it’s true. but we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. her name is amy farrah fowler."
32694,Raj,that sounds like a yes.
30382,Raj,"well, i’m going back to india. what’s your plan?"
33381,Raj,it doesn’t matter. it’s the thought that counts.
30910,Raj,"oh, you don’t want that."
32478,Raj,wow.
33347,Raj,that’s so amazing.
32876,Raj,"hang on. oh no. oh, no. oh, god, no."
30569,Raj,there are no solar flares right now.
30078,Raj,"that what that’s for? in india, the lid just touches the cheese. of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie."
30745,Raj,seven years.
31412,Raj,"this is a treat, what brings you guys by?"
31888,Raj,probably because i didn’t read the instructions. no wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. unless his name is jay-z.
32068,Raj,"yeah, anything is better than this."
29701,Raj,five.
31115,Raj,"why do you care so much? you’re dating my sister, and penny and i are in love."
31576,Raj,"okay, yeah, that’s pretty good."
30761,Raj,eight for 28.
32098,Raj,"come on, come on, you haven’t even heard it yet. leonard, give me a beat."
34064,Raj,do you see the way she’s looking at him?
34014,Raj,"oh, hey, guys. come in."
29825,Raj,"oh, i’m sorry, is that politically incorrect? in india we just call them untouchables."
29622,Raj,if you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
30056,Raj,how can she when you beat around the bush. she’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.
32139,Raj,"oh, can i show her an oil painting i made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?"
31735,Raj,"two words, 3-d printer. wait, maybe it’s three words. no, hang on. okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-d printer."
32606,Raj,"ooh, we could have one of those retreats."
33760,Raj,"oh, yay, i have a doctorate in astrophysics and i’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store."
32230,Raj,"are you sure? he’s tall, pale and awkward. that sounds like your type."
33253,Raj,i kind of like chicken fingers.
32188,Raj,"yeah, if your mom could see her little bar mitzvah boy right now, she’d have a heart attack."
30774,Raj,"oh, okay. good. i don’t need more comics. howard’s gonna stop by, we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and indian monopoly."
32447,Raj,"you know, when cinnamon won’t take her medicine, i hide it in a piece of cheese."
29541,Raj,you could power down.
32091,Raj,"as i’m sure you’re aware, the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…"
33883,Raj,the housekeeper does the shopping.
30481,Raj,who else could it be? it has to be eddie crispo.
29712,Raj,in a minute. howard stepped outside to throw up. 
32499,Raj,yes.
32211,Raj,so i read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.
30962,Raj,i don’t think my character should be in a place like this. everyone’s undressing her with their eyes.
30913,Raj,"no. we are very wealthy. but the only difference is, we have more servants."
32279,Raj,"as if valentine’s day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? and with cheap chocolate, no less?"
32373,Raj,"great, everyone’s a byomkesh bakshi. now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues."
31053,Raj,"oh, that sounds lovely."
30042,Raj,"hello, michaela."
31391,Raj,"well, let’s see. yup, three missed calls."
30366,Raj,"actually, i’ve never had three dates with the same woman."
32030,Raj,because i’ve got something even better planned.
33971,Raj,"yeah, me, too."
31739,Raj,not to mention malibu koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.
32308,Raj,aha.
30456,Raj,what the hell is that?
31411,Raj,do you hear how homophobic you sound?
34174,Raj,"oh, i’ll get it."
29775,Raj,"yes i do, come on. see you later leonard. "
30111,Raj,"well, we’ll always have the night the heat went out."
32544,Raj,"okay, okay. although many older women lead vibrant, active…"
33407,Raj,"emily, listen, i’m sorry, but i can’t come by."
31684,Raj,damn it.
31593,Raj,i think it’s an old storage room.
30306,Raj,"you’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend."
33696,Raj,uh.
31602,Raj,"but next time, we’ll be cat burglars."
30629,Raj,are you willing to risk it?
32819,Raj,i’m so sick of people being mean on the internet.
32846,Raj,"yeah, i, i, i saw that article you’re talking about. uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy."
33884,Raj,i’m spoiled? your baby has a cape that costs $300.
31992,Raj,"oh, great. there go my chances of being sexually harassed."
30547,Raj,"oh, that would be a good way to go."
32043,Raj,"yes, exactly. where is the coin? why don’t you look in your pockets? i slipped them in there earlier today."
31503,Raj,"oh, i’m sorry. i’ll leave."
32431,Raj,it’s going to be okay.
33469,Raj,"all right, it’s almost game time. get it? game of thrones, game time?"
30336,Raj,i don’t care! and why don’t you think i can find a woman for myself?
31274,Raj,"i heard you call her brown sugar. in my book, that’s defilement."
31723,Raj,are they actually arguing about comic books?
31823,Raj,"uh, lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. maybe we could start with something simpler."
32485,Raj,please hurry.
31651,Raj,"mine just took me to his gynecology office. i got so bored, i’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend i was ice-skating."
32492,Raj,is that a real thing?
33540,Raj,"hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door."
33227,Raj,what is everyone booing at?
32711,Raj,i’m sorry. this is very sweet. thanks.
29632,Raj,"can we please stop talking about my testicles? sheldon, tell them what you did."
33731,Raj,"hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along."
33501,Raj,"so, uh, what are you guys talking about?"
33371,Raj,"come on, sheldon, say something."
31193,Raj,"oh, fine. let’s agree she kissed both of us."
31424,Raj,you can make him do anything you want.
34022,Raj,"no, you didn’t. okay? look, bert, when i had money, i dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me. and then i gave up my money, and now i’m alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now."
32194,Raj,"you didn’t ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds."
34093,Raj,"enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6…7"
31162,Raj,"no, it’s just that everybody’s got someone. sheldon’s with amy, howard’s getting married, you’re dating my sister."
30753,Raj,i may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.
31185,Raj,what are you doing?
30199,Raj,"you, you’re kidding. that’s fantastic!"
32628,Raj,"ooh, that is a lot of hair. ow. and now i’m gonna hear it from jenny."
32477,Raj,it was just a suggestion.
33589,Raj,"well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind."
33377,Raj,"you know, on game of thrones, balon greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box."
32462,Raj,what?
33390,Raj,"i’m sorry, i don’t think that’s a good idea."
30236,Raj,aha! so i am working with you.
32013,Raj,"no problem. ooh, you made little sandwiches."
32936,Raj,"okay, but something smells fishy. and not just because you work around sea animals. that actually sounds interesting, and i’d like to learn more about it. hey, you okay?"
31114,Raj,"yeah, right. you’re just jealous because it turns out i’m penny’s number two choice after leonard."
30542,Raj,maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with penny.
30616,Raj,since when?
32894,Raj,of course. what?
29944,Raj,fo’ shizzle.
29697,Raj,"boy, sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. did you see it, it’s rough. "
33929,Raj,"cool, cool, yeah, yeah, hold on one second."
30450,Raj,"no way, dude!"
29670,Raj,"i can’t talk to her, you do it. "
31450,Raj,"thank you, bernadette."
31768,Raj,"mm-hmm. how do you sleep in these things? silk pajamas on satin sheets? i slid out of the bed, like, three times."
30961,Raj,"bad news, the nigerian prince may be a fraud."
33212,Raj,i wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.
30870,Raj,"you mean, project lenwoloppali?"
30933,Raj,"penny, you became disenchanted with leonard as a lover. would you please tell my sister why?"
29666,Raj,okay. how about that one.
32055,Raj,"my parents’ money. uh, what did you put for your best feature?"
33204,Raj,"yeah. he’s 24. he’s a deejay. he brews his own beer. he’s got awesome tattoos. dude, he’s got a hot girlfriend, too."
29941,Raj,feel better now?
30265,Raj,half of it will be mine.
31730,Raj,"say hello to an exact scale model of me. oh, i’m not dark chocolate. i’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel."
30974,Raj,"sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude."
32303,Raj,course.
31311,Raj,how’d you do?
33909,Raj,really? i’ll do anything.
30301,Raj,fine. paint green flames on your little scooter with her. 
31720,Raj,"fine, then i guess it’s two against two. how do we decide?"
34111,Raj,"namaste, white people. good news! i rented us the four-hour edition of watchmen."
33815,Raj,"howard, get out."
29606,Raj,"is there another penny here? i had such plans. i had dreams. i was going to be the indira gandhi of particle astro-physics. but with a penis, of course. "
33064,Raj,"hey, leonard, when you’re done, we came up with a bunch more."
29639,Raj,i don’t want to be in a jar. i want my brain in an android body. eight feet tall and ripped. 
32440,Raj,since when do you go to spin class?
30866,Raj,world’s greatest astrophysicist?
33765,Raj,congratulations.
34170,Raj,don’t forgive them. stay mad at them.
29927,Raj,what difference does it make? fat is fat.
32076,Raj,"it wasn’t a pyjama party. it was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching princess bride."
31885,Raj,"yeah, well, i wouldn’t get too close. if i give the right command in german, she’ll rip your face off."
33411,Raj,"as a matter of fact, i do. i’m gonna comfort her, because i’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to."
29543,Raj,"of course, but it’s all indian food. you can’t find a bagel in mumbai to save your life. schmear me."
29725,Raj,"dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot."
33785,Raj,it looks like a map from dungeons and dragons. 
34177,Raj,"hello. howard and bernadette kicked me out because i told them they’re having a girl. oopsy, i did it again."
32766,Raj,"no, i’m not okay. i feel like i’m gonna jump out of my skin."
32448,Raj,i was thinking we could watch a dvd.
31914,Raj,"painfully so. we have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. so into her."
32662,Raj,what if we brought them down with us?
31605,Raj,how did that work out?
32256,Raj,"you know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?"
30069,Raj,yeah.
30992,Raj,"oh, my god, i think you broke my toe!"
29976,Raj,you know what i’m thinking? i’m thinking howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. i’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
31961,Raj,"you know, i, i’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so friday night, my friends are having a party."
31693,Raj,your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
33258,Raj,how is that both our names?
30955,Raj,you ever gonna tell him?
32119,Raj,i’ll tell you where it’s coming from. all you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.
32392,Raj,thank you. i thought it was inspired.
33206,Raj,that is so cool. old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
32588,Raj,"um, well, in my defence, i tell everybody."
30153,Raj,"yes, very nice."
34020,Raj,i think it shows a lot of character.
31952,Raj,good idea. bernadette?
29757,Raj,"oh sweet krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker."
33691,Raj,that’s why i already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.
32644,Raj,"uh, sheldon…"
31612,Raj,he’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
32294,Raj,did bernadette think it was cool?
31011,Raj,how did that even happen? did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?
29554,Raj,"really, because i saw peter pan, and you’re dressed exactly like cathy rigby. she was a little bigger than you, but it’s basically the same look, man. "
30989,Raj,what does that mean?
31248,Raj,incredibly so.
33349,Raj,"i read that in los angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars."
30311,Raj,"no, i’m mad at you. i hate myself, but i’m mad at you."
34003,Raj,"uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on colorado boulevard."
30044,Raj,"not now, leonard, michaela’s inviting me to a party. you better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you."
34061,Raj,"hi. oh, let me bring a chair for you. "
31059,Raj,"you’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal."
30281,Raj,"what are you waiting for? kill wil wheaton! from hell’s heart, stab at him!"
32613,Raj,"oh. it’s wonderful, and i swear i’m not saying that because justin timberlake is in it."
34112,Raj,"hey, it’s disco night at the moonlight roller rink in glendale tonight. who’s up for getting down?"
34158,Raj,"hey, there."
32778,Raj,what kind of scientist are you? everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
33518,Raj,"no, i was just thinking about jurassic world. boy, that was terrible."
30092,Raj,me either.
34080,Raj,we’re being ridiculous. there’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce sheldon cooper.
33823,Raj,"well, that was a waste of time. i’m such an idiot."
32040,Raj,i invited you to my murder mystery party.
32950,Raj,what makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?
32612,Raj,"ooh, this is exciting. we’re innovating. i feel like we’re in the facebook movie."
31493,Raj,"oh, i’m having the nicest time. you guys are like family to me. you know that, right?"
32836,Raj,great.
30679,Raj,"yeah, what if i buy my own desk?"
33177,Raj,"i don’t think it matters. look, sheldon, i believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen. okay? not because of a test or a web site, but because…  we are the dreamers of dreams."
33529,Raj,it is funny when you think about it.
32636,Raj,don’t they lay eggs on a rock?
32185,Raj,"sheldon, i think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. she can only be there for you as much as you are for her."
29881,Raj,what are negs?
29562,Raj,what do you suppose she meant by that?
30847,Raj,but i’m green lantern.
30239,Raj,let me finish.
31559,Raj,"oh, howard, i’ve got a party to plan. don’t make me pull it out of you."
30328,Raj,"really! did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, howard, i am upset."
30011,Raj,so what are we going to do tonight?
31466,Raj,penny.  
29540,Raj,"also, sheldon may be a robot. "
30145,Raj,enjoy oxnard. i’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you.
30349,Raj,"yeah, thank you. mmmm."
29962,Raj,a successful quest. now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
31663,Raj,stop it. you’re ruining girls’ night.
30675,Raj,you’re being unreasonable. why can’t i have a desk?
30431,Raj,there’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
30958,Raj,"why so glum, chum?"
31702,Raj,"yeah, yeah, me, too. i didn’t do anything."
30769,Raj,"come on, guys! hurry up! hurry up!"
21784,Raj,hey.
33780,Raj,did that do anything?
33704,Raj,great. where would you like to go?
33274,Raj,of course i do.
34169,Raj,okay. would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?
30515,Raj,"well, so then we start the game over until there’s a winner."
33530,Raj,hello.
32174,Raj,he loves you.
33732,Raj,"is this what you do when i’m not here, make really good points?"
30949,Raj,how about that!
29750,Raj,everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. why not put a little mocha in the family latte. 
30487,Raj,there are no jewish hobbits.
31758,Raj,"i don’t know, maybe drive down to hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if i can get lucky."
33887,Raj,"thank you, but if i’m gonna just take advantage of my friends, i might as well keep on relying on my father."
33341,Raj,"before emily, i was alone for so long. i just, i don’t know if i can do that again."
31356,Raj,"hey, want to spend some time playing the new star wars game this weekend?"
33508,Raj,"sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy."
29969,Raj,"you always say that, but we never do."
32939,Raj,"listen, dude, it’s time for you to hit the road."
30932,Raj,my sister.
33128,Raj,my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.
33893,Raj,"yeah, i’m making a bunch of changes. this morning, i fired my dog walker."
33247,Raj,no.
31502,Raj,"hey, stuart."
30255,Raj,nobody can.
30247,Raj,so you were wrong.
30193,Raj,what are you eating?
31958,Raj,we might as well go ahead and eat. she’s not coming back anytime soon.
31904,Raj,"hello? what do you mean, you found my dog? she’s with my friends. is she okay? oh, thank you. uh, just text me your address, i’m on my way. oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. but do not give her anything starchy. she’s having risotto for dinner."
30131,Raj,"great. now how are you going to settle it, hmm? there is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it."
34185,Raj,"yeah, you keep saying how much sheldon has affected all of us, but you’ve clearly had an impact on him."
34098,Raj,sorry.
29715,Raj,i still want it on my balcony. i say we move it on a bi-monthly basis. 
34188,Raj,huh. that does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. we could take some more simulated instrument readings.
31953,Raj,"well, you’re very pretty. that could be intimidating to another woman."
30066,Raj,he can’t figure out how to fix it.
29743,Raj,"missy, do you enjoy pajamas?"
31517,Raj,no problem. my treat. i’ll swing by after work.
29617,Raj,of course you do. who could forget being that fat? 
29955,Raj,"later, dude."
33112,Raj,"yeah, so what?"
31250,Raj,annie ogly.
31196,Raj,i’m hammered.
30722,Raj,"hey, leonard, will you please tell howard my sister’s never been attracted to him."
32451,Raj,"uh, so, you’ll watch it?"
31917,Raj,i’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
30554,Raj,"oh, please, we all know i’m the friend you call when you have no other options. if we were the justice league, i’d be aquaman."
31198,Raj,"aha. i see what’s going on here. you and i had our crazy night together, and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman."
34143,Raj,"as you’re reading, it will help to remember i have an adorable accent."
31550,Raj,"before i forget, i’d like your opinion on the menus i’ve prepared for the halloween party. the theme is food that goes bump in the night."
31181,Raj,"let’s see, what else can i tell you about me that would make you like me? ooh, i love music. do you love music?"
30273,Raj,"sheldon, it’s your play. sheldon."
33539,Raj,can we take a moment to discuss that i just lied to the government for you?
30845,Raj,no.
29601,Raj,what are you doing?
32848,Raj,why don’t you just do the test?
31670,Raj,"why can’t i find someone? i’m smart, i’ve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means i can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t."
32086,Raj,that is so beautiful.
32039,Raj,"good riddle, huh?"
32281,Raj,"all right. uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? we’re usually in bed by now, and i want her to know that i’m here. yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon."
33582,Raj,"oh. mine was winnie the pooh. but anyway, why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? right? there are so many amazing ones. red, blue, green, purple."
32809,Raj,"hey, guys. mind if emily joins us for lunch?"
32326,Raj,"no one was writing me back, so i stopped checking my profile."
30768,Raj,you’re right. it should be a cuddly asian boy. like me.
29564,Raj,that works. 
30077,Raj,"howard, wait. why don’t you use this instead of the pvc to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?"
29578,Raj,and over here is sheldon.
31267,Raj,"i’m telling you, dude, there’s a seat on the hogwarts express with your name on it."
30321,Raj,"actually, in this case, i think she was."
32159,Raj,"my, my. the plot, like my gravy, thickens."
32955,Raj,no. we can do this by ourselves.
31470,Raj,"me, too."
29529,Raj,"actually, i was less the chatter than the chattee."
34125,Raj,"oh, guess who."
30288,Raj,"no, she didn’t."
32906,Raj,i’m not making any promises.
33081,Raj,there’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.
33825,Raj,"dude, come on."
31977,Raj,i am. and now i’m crying for a whole different reason!
33415,Raj,"well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like me. you need any help?"
32158,Raj,"no, no, speak up. i’m about to use the blender, and i don’t want to miss anything."
29915,Raj,"trailing badly, wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with sheldon cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68."
33035,Raj,"i don’t know, guys. maybe this relationship isn’t for me. maybe i should break up with her."
30664,Raj,what does hit a reef mean?
32633,Raj,"you know, sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well."
30379,Raj,i believe that’s the president of the university.
34110,Raj,"we represent the lollipop guild, and we want you."
31816,Raj,i lied. i love them. i only said that so you’d go out with me.
29889,Raj,"oh, snap."
31985,Raj,you think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?
30118,Raj,"yeah, but since you and penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night."
30377,Raj,"oh, sheldon, you remind me of a young lex luthor."
34084,Raj,"she’s so chatty. maybe my parents are right. maybe i’d be better off with an indian girl. we’d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me. "
30186,Raj,"so, my visa’s only good as long as i’m employed at the university, and when they find out i’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. by the way, when i say squat, i mean diddly-squat. i wish i had squat."
30411,Raj,no. i’m looking for a hookup.
31073,Raj,"okay, gotta go."
32269,Raj,"uh, maybe it’ll come up when i apply for citizenship. oh, crap, what if it comes up when i apply for citizenship? "
31192,Raj,"whatever, dude. she kissed me."
29536,Raj,he’s selling the sword of azeroth on ebay.
31628,Raj,aah! it’s eating his face!
31277,Raj,he’s got to be doing this on purpose.
31418,Raj,why?
30369,Raj,i thought it was funny.
32417,Raj,"no. i, i have no idea. what would you do?"
30058,Raj,"uh, actually, if it’s not too much to ask, could we have the jewish girlfriend experience."
32025,Raj,"uh, it wasn’t anything weird. it was just to see how big they were."
33756,Raj,"i know that. but to be fair, i’ve spent nine months helping bernadette get ready for this baby, and howard spent five minutes conceiving it. and i’m being generous."
32899,Raj,everything okay?
31093,Raj,what the hell is this?
30929,Raj,are you sure? that doesn’t sound right.
33974,Raj,paul.
30039,Raj,sounds like a plan.
33806,Raj,"don’t worry, i’m a grown man. i have a thick skin."
29650,Raj,"well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of charlton heston. "
30709,Raj,are you going to let me tell the story or not?
33778,Raj,have you tried anything to fix it?
33066,Raj,"yeah, penny packed you a bag."
33175,Raj,"guys, fifteen seconds."
29816,Raj,"really, you don’t have to go to any trouble."
29648,Raj,you did what you had to do. 
33787,Raj,it’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.
33984,Raj,when did he leave?
31972,Raj,"no. it’s my fault. you know, i finally found someone who was right for me, and i, i drove her away."
30194,Raj,"oh, beefaroni. i think i’ll miss you most of all."
29863,Raj,"you might want to slow down a bit, buddy."
31086,Raj,"are you kidding? he made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in cpr. thank god he had a dummy."
30714,Raj,oh please. my sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
33584,Raj,"okay, well, i’m just trying to help you."
32087,Raj,of course. i’d be happy to shred it on my ax.
30900,Raj,"of course, of course. now when you say look after, you mean…"
34190,Raj,is this what i sound like when i talk about india?
30981,Raj,she’s curvy and she owns it. i like that.
30597,Raj,why didn’t you say anything?
31751,Raj,"well, then, i should tell you i broke the wheel and the handle. so, is everyone from bernadette’s company going to vegas?"
31010,Raj,shut your ass!
29823,Raj,"okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why i can’t go, alrighty? koothrappali out. god bless that boy, i don’t know what i’d do without him."
33453,Raj,"hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?"
33060,Raj,"you don’t have to, you should want to."
33563,Raj,and right here.
33897,Raj,i have a card for emergencies that i pay for myself.
33313,Raj,"wait, are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?"
29667,Raj,are you crying?
30734,Raj,"not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums."
31171,Raj,"okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows i’m cool with it, i’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. i was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about…? oh, no, i bet you didn’t."
32877,Raj,"dude, the whole front came off. now she’s gonna know i was snooping."
33844,Raj,got it.
31056,Raj,"your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? oh, yeah, that can only be good for you."
32429,Raj,why the rush? she isn’t going anywhere.
29742,Raj,"the indian sex book. in other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us."
33467,Raj,"wait, did amy make her spinach dip?"
31150,Raj,"come on, dude. this is my sister you’re talking about."
33725,Raj,it’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.
32287,Raj,"oh, actually that’s a van dyke. a goatee is just hair on the chin."
33816,Raj,"okay, that’s enough. write down loving son."
34173,Raj,"hey, jon snow. how come your horse has a basket on it?"
33674,Raj,thank you.
32956,Raj,i don’t know. how do you want to start?
33052,Raj,and you knew about this this whole time?
31394,Raj,say again.
32567,Raj,you look like a jackass.
31296,Raj,"thank you, darling."
29647,Raj,"well i’d like to point out, i voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. ."
32026,Raj,"uh, can i just say, i’ve missed all of us hanging out together."
31711,Raj,stop!
33445,Raj,but wouldn’t man-batman just be a batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
32114,Raj,"yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so i wanted to do something to let her know i was thinking about her."
31944,Raj,"nope. it’s exactly as lousy as advertised. speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. i was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?"
30147,Raj,"oh, what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?"
32479,Raj,should we try to console him?
31013,Raj,"leonard, please. the man is talking. let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may."
32921,Raj,let’s just play.
31103,Raj,more wine?
32319,Raj,is that a real book? i would totally read that book.
30780,Raj,"excuse me. i can’t be drinking, i’m about to make an important scientific discovery here."
30451,Raj,why wouldn’t you take penny?
31080,Raj,"come on, dude, i’m exhausted, and tyra banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep."
32362,Raj,stuart? are you okay?
33964,Raj,downward-facing dog. 
33482,Raj,"hi, yeah. um, i was wondering, if you’re free saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting."
33580,Raj,"i think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. so, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?"
30348,Raj,good idea. they’ll be refreshed.
33188,Raj,"you know, i read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. the key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes."
31513,Raj,i should go.
31594,Raj,"well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. can you hear anything?"
30483,Raj,"wait, wait. sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. how much is something like this worth?"
31337,Raj,mr. roper’s dead? you can’t just spring that on a guy.
30628,Raj,"sheldon, i’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever."
33071,Raj,"uh, okay, let’s see. they’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea."
33101,Raj,"okay, and here’s the hook. thor and dr. jones. thor and dr. jones. one plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
29899,Raj,yeah.
33599,Raj,i’m the son of a gynaecologist. i could be helpful. 
34115,Raj,"sorry, dude, the thermostat’s on my side of the room, so it stays mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid indian music!"
33697,Raj,uh. 
32608,Raj,nothing bad happens in the lake house.
30697,Raj,thank you.
30663,Raj,that’s very offensive.
29581,Raj,"papa, please don’t start. "
32700,Raj,"okay. here we go, say cheese. iskip) say cheese. iskip) say cousin. iskip) say…"
29888,Raj,"you could try calling triple-a, but based on nasa’s latest timetable, they won’t get there for 35 years."
30242,Raj,come and get it.
31772,Raj,you’re being silly. i can leave whenever i want.
33087,Raj,"hey, look, the lug nut’s off."
32348,Raj,"i give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it."
29984,Raj,hang on a sec. why do you get first crack at her?
32724,Raj,"maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with. strawberries, caviar, oysters. all good choices. yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties."
32164,Raj,"no, i’m gonna brush cinnamon’s teeth."
33851,Raj,"okay, yes, i will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch."
32157,Raj,"hey, guys, i’m trying to cook in here."
31211,Raj,"mmm. oh, cheesecake, you’re just as good as a woman, even though i can’t have sex with you."
32986,Raj,"it’s, like, the best one they make, i just can’t get it to work."
31916,Raj,"you’re right, i should finish the game. i take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. i’m dead, i’ve got a date with a girl. bye."
34054,Raj,as soon as i have the place set up i’m gonna have you guys over.
31288,Raj,"so, siri, what’s happening? how are you?"
29735,Raj,"psh, what a bunch of crybabies. no guts, no glory man. "
33451,Raj,"but, dude, you’re so lucky. getting to stay home at night with the woman you love."
34017,Raj,i’d love a personal trainer. i haven’t seen my abs since they opened a shake shack on my drive home.
32136,Raj,"he’s right. but in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything."
31085,Raj,"scotty, i need more power."
32048,Raj,which celebrity would you say i look like the most?
30868,Raj,"hey, we agreed when it was eureka time, we were all gonna say it together."
30501,Raj,"no, he’s doesn’t! he’s lying to you!"
31585,Raj,it’s sad that you know that.
30107,Raj,it was the only way to keep you from being such a huge dickensian. you see that? i added the ensian.
29615,Raj,"little lalita. that’s kind of fun to say. little lalita, little lalita, little lalita, you should try it."
33930,Raj,"hey, what’s it like sharing a bathroom with penny? is there hair everywhere? does she use your loofah?"
29778,Raj,not until now. 
34027,Raj,"that’s it, we’re dead."
32243,Raj,"so we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?"
30614,Raj,the dating site matched a woman with sheldon.
34035,Raj,"you want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these."
29905,Raj,"it’s got a big bird on it, dude."
29611,Raj,"okay, now i just need to make sure i have a lalita before i meet the grasshopper. it’s a sweet green miracle. "
32338,Raj,"just tell her what i’m really like. and, if you think it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. use your own words."
32340,Raj,but i’m always on howard’s team. we’re best friends. the kind who finish each others…
29866,Raj,judge’s ruling?
31697,Raj,i did. the guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
30886,Raj,you really think so?
33432,Raj,i don’t understand.
32196,Raj,"open wide, here comes the happy train."
33767,Raj,"you hear that, stuart? i’ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing."
32486,Raj,"if she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?"
33561,Raj,so i guess i won’t be seeing you guys for a while.
31894,Raj,i do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.
32137,Raj,"well, can i say she looks nice?"
30048,Raj,"it was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours."
29751,Raj,"she’s not hiding. she needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. oh, and then i believe she has to wash her hair. "
33581,Raj,of course it does. didn’t your baby room have a theme?
30739,Raj,where are we going?
31487,Raj,hello-lo-lo.
33875,Raj,"okay, i’ll tell you, but please don’t judge me. he pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards."
29871,Raj,"party with the pretty girls, dude!"
33894,Raj,"uh, i gave her an imodium. that’s tomorrow’s problem."
32528,Raj,"boy, i’m so hungry today. i wonder why?"
31814,Raj,really? then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?
29561,Raj,"oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there’s a billion more where he came from. "
33213,Raj,"and he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from footprints on the moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!"
33011,Raj,not cool.
29621,Raj,back off sheldon. 
30835,Raj,you realize you can’t win.
29577,Raj,sorry papa.
29989,Raj,really? i just made it up. have you seen slumdog millionaire?
34163,Raj,you really think so?
30798,Raj,hey.
32501,Raj,you don’t have to make me anything.
29633,Raj,sorry? that’s all you can say is sorry?
32184,Raj,"i can’t believe they’re still married. oh, no, i forgot cinnamon’s toothbrush at howard’s. i guess you’re sharing with daddy again. "
33111,Raj,i still love it. i just think there’s room for improvement.
34090,Raj,we brought food.
32915,Raj,"dude, three-time sanskriti school for well-born boys badminton champion."
32543,Raj,so are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?
31309,Raj,"oh. if i had one, it would be brown dynamite."
30580,Raj,holy crap!  holy crap!
32425,Raj,"are you kidding me? this may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. how can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?"
31321,Raj,maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.
32165,Raj,and the other half licking my face. that’s why i’m brushing her teeth.
30599,Raj,good?
32187,Raj,"wait, so star wars and star trek characters can go on the same branch?"
29643,Raj,why not? 
30683,Raj,"is that the american idiom for giant, big-ass desk?"
32599,Raj,i’m so glad we could work this all out.
33354,Raj,it’s true. i like my giant ipad and my little ipad almost as much as my regular-sized ipad.
31347,Raj,thank you.
31365,Raj,"what, you invited your girlfriend? this is supposed to be our weekend."
33555,Raj,"well, you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer."
31539,Raj,"just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots i bought him for his birthday."
33054,Raj,let’s leave leonard out of this for the moment. this is about you and me.
30857,Raj,where would you go?
31666,Raj,"okay, an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub."
33145,Raj,what? i thought we were all… never mind.
32548,Raj,"i don’t know. i mean, she’s lonely. he needs a place to stay. i doubt there’s any funny business going on. and even if there was, who cares? they’re both adults."
29656,Raj,go away. 
31839,Raj,shame on all of you.
32503,Raj,wouldn’t you be upset if you saw amy out with someone else?
31426,Raj,i wouldn’t mind a glass.
33566,Raj,"so, what should we do today?"
31332,Raj,"ooh, gossip. when i first got here, i thought you americans really gossiped around the water cooler. so i hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip i ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler."
30124,Raj,that’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down.
32037,Raj,"oh, congratulations. you’re the first team to arrive."
33489,Raj,"also, uh, cherries?"
33602,Raj,"well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder."
30464,Raj,"well, obviously you don’t remember your circumcision."
30573,Raj,what?
32467,Raj,sure.
32053,Raj,"come on. one more time. yeah, it’s, it’s a little blurry, but i think that works in your favour. do you want a beer?"
30486,Raj,all the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride jet skis. that can’t just be a coincidence.
31908,Raj,"yes. i picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. and then we got pinkberry."
30852,Raj,"oh, great. no superman, no wonder woman? all we’ve got is a skinny flash, an indian aquaman, a nearsighted green lantern, and a teeny, tiny dark knight."
32677,Raj,"well, that didn’t go your way."
30254,Raj,all right. 
33281,Raj,"you went to emily’s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying."
29682,Raj,okay. first order of physics bowl business. we need a truly kick-ass team name. suggestions.
33493,Raj,i said no questions.
33840,Raj,"while i’m gone, you can think about how mean you were to me."
31521,Raj,what’s the big deal? you guys are bringing your girlfriends. i didn’t want to sit by myself.
29972,Raj,we need a plan. how about operation hammer of the gods?
31791,Raj,"i got to tell you, we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. excuse me, everybody. can i have your attention, please? we’re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. but that doesn’t make us mutants. the only mutants here are in these comic books. we’ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship. you know what i see when i look around? i see a room full of great people. so let’s give ourselves a break. we are a community, and as long as we have each other, we’re never truly alone."
33278,Raj,"fine, how about this? you’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and i wish you’d stop."
31865,Raj,"wait, hold on. this is weird."
30966,Raj,"oh, no, don’t put me in the middle of this. i’m not going to be your go-between."
31155,Raj,i’m impressed. this is very lifelike.
30785,Raj,"bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes."
33710,Raj,what’s this button do?
30073,Raj,"it’s not superstition. it’s practically newtonian. for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. it’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around."
30362,Raj,he’s right.
33135,Raj,"hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de mayo."
29824,Raj,"yes, but i’m finding that having a lackey suits me."
34176,Raj,me
31842,Raj,"okay, um, it was a card for your 18th birthday. inside it said, happy birthday, howard. i love you. dad. oh, and it was a far side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. thinks it’s a fly. silly frog. so funny."
33433,Raj,of course. i’ll give you guys some space. let me just get this out of your way.
33166,Raj,i’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
33733,Raj,thank you.
34043,Raj,i may be moving out soon. i think i found a place to live.
31975,Raj,"no, i, i won’t. i’m, i’m unlovable."
29885,Raj,star trek v!
31548,Raj,"you know, you don’t worry about money. i’ll take care of everything."
32178,Raj,"howard, listen to me. you’re a great husband. yes, your listening skills could use some work. but it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom."
33693,Raj,"that depends, do they have mexican food in cuba?"
31590,Raj,we just told you.
31072,Raj,"really, ten miles? you’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? moron."
32351,Raj,what?
32731,Raj,"well, you could be very frugal. i’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm."
31604,Raj,when did you learn how to pick locks?
32092,Raj,"oh. you poor thing. you have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can’t use it. fortunately, another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach. "
30655,Raj,"ah. nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear rocky mountain spring water. where are the rocky mountains, anyway?"
33925,Raj,"uh, yeah. why do you ask?"
32507,Raj,"i don’t understand it. i’m a nice guy, i have a great job, i’m well-educated, come from a good family. why don’t women want to be with me?"
30619,Raj,that was a lousy suggestion.
33486,Raj,"oh, she’s meeting us here. hey, guys, do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. we’re just keeping it casual."
32564,Raj,why didn’t girls like us in high school?
33024,Raj,"face it, dude, bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship."
30370,Raj,you laughed.
29713,Raj,"oh yeah. the guy who lives next to me is always like, i have a jacuzzi on my balcony, i have a jacuzzi on my balcony. but wait until i tell him, i’ve got a time machine on my balcony. stuff that in your speedos, jacuzzi bob!"
30119,Raj,"yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky."
30467,Raj,you called it.
33320,Raj,"yeah, of course. we have no secrets."
30657,Raj,"philadelphia. okay, now i get it."
32215,Raj,are possums cute?
30356,Raj,"if i could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and i would be their king."
29817,Raj,"i’d rather have fishbine’s, it’s bigger."
33717,Raj,"thank you for saying that. next to buying things, that is the best part about having money."
29720,Raj,"ooh, how far into the future?"
31107,Raj,yeah.
32559,Raj,"aw, you brought cookies for everyone?"
33830,Raj,"it was for the girls. they broke up with me, i don’t care if they get fat."
30899,Raj,"no, no, no, don’t say that. you’re going to be all right."
32437,Raj,"god, you never listen."
29589,Raj,why are you telling me about my own culture? 
30518,Raj,"my point is, if i were a horse or a bird, i’d be very nervous around james cameron."
31788,Raj,"then i’d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion."
32298,Raj,wow. what did you tell them?
33157,Raj,"fine, i’ll leave. but it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper."
29869,Raj,marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.
30350,Raj,"yeah, very tasty. well, so tell me more about these teachers."
33615,Raj,"answer the question, what are you doing here?"
30071,Raj,"be afraid of penny, nice, very crafty."
30468,Raj,"mine says, to raj, from stan lee."
33380,Raj,"you know, i have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her."
32155,Raj,"uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?"
34085,Raj,"hello. sorry i’m late. but i was in the hallway, chatting up penny."
32970,Raj,what?
30815,Raj,"yeah, leonard, who?"
32719,Raj,"i don’t know. this old pen kind of proves gravity. when i tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off."
33797,Raj,"i’m not a virgin, sheldon."
33068,Raj,and i told you he bit me.
31892,Raj,"no kidding. you didn’t make it easy to find. i spent hours digging around online. for the record, you have excellent credit scores. and your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine."
30009,Raj,i could go for some goat.
31124,Raj,do you think i have a shot with penny?
30305,Raj,"wow, you just don’t get it, do you? buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away."
33664,Raj,"well, i can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time."
29902,Raj,"too bad, ’cause she was checking you out before."
32426,Raj,"um, kind of hit a bump. when i was honest and told emily she wasn’t the only person i was seeing, it went great. so i tried the same thing with lucy."
32415,Raj,"thank you. thanks, thanks. i’m sorry. i can’t do this. my, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and i’m seeing her saturday, and i’m glad you like it, it’s from j. crew."
29525,Raj,why?
33226,Raj,check.
34073,Raj,good to see you.
32000,Raj,"yeah, i can relate to being a single parent. i have a dog."
30719,Raj,train day?
33870,Raj,it turns out he doesn’t care if i’m married or if i’m single. he’s basically given up on me.
32720,Raj,poor roger abbott.
30794,Raj,"oh, what’s the point of everything?"
30833,Raj,"oh, yeah? well, i’ve been taking pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a hershey bar."
32964,Raj,"like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers."
32703,Raj,"they used to like going to the mumbai symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in."
29912,Raj,i didn’t get a good look. can i go again?
31232,Raj,let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
32590,Raj,"well, we were being honest. you would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped leonard?"
31632,Raj,"they are, too."
33762,Raj,hey.
32835,Raj,"and you’re eating alone at a deli. i don’t buy it, you’re not him."
30635,Raj,where does he poop?
29688,Raj,hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
32675,Raj,i would love to see your collection.
29651,Raj,how about lasic? 
31828,Raj,"she and i are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea."
33165,Raj,"oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner sheldon’s contact information."
33551,Raj,"to a white guy born here, no. if you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying."
33155,Raj,"well, it’s easy to find out. just go into the crawlspace under the house and check."
30662,Raj,i was homesick.
32408,Raj,"i can’t date two women at once. zero women, that’s my sweet spot."
30064,Raj,sure you remember. you went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
33600,Raj,"the polite response is, thank you for noticing."
32754,Raj,"dude, it’s not breathing."
31943,Raj,yeah. he brought me back a t-shirt that said my friend went to the space station and all i got was this lousy t-shirt
31064,Raj,"good, good."
32251,Raj,so that’s it? everything’s sold out?
30560,Raj,"well, i need a wingman. i don’t want to come off like a lonely loser."
34137,Raj,"all right. crank up the ac, boys, it’s gonna get hot in here!"
34032,Raj,"could you say that in english? i actually, i never learned hindi."
31344,Raj,is there anything you’re both equally bad at?
31578,Raj,"yeah, but if he’s a sore loser, maybe you’re better off without him."
31478,Raj,"oh, okay. i’ll just go home and be alone. which is cool. i eat alone, i sleep alone, i cry alone, so, cool."
31194,Raj,i’m so mad at you!
32578,Raj,"well, hey, you’re my dear friends. you’ll get a christmas card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me."
34108,Raj,that’s still not funny.
32963,Raj,and doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.
33653,Raj,"oh, no, it’s okay. i just found a wobble."
30045,Raj,"excuse me, i’ll be right back. don’t go anywhere. don’t move. just stay the beautiful unspoiled american flower that you are.  what’s wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy."
31213,Raj,"so, what’s gonna happen next? are you and bernadette going to break up?"
33088,Raj,have you seen this archie comic? it’s actually archie versus predator.
32888,Raj,"uh w, well, okay, look, i, i don’t want to lie to you. i got curious, i was looking around and i broke the drawer on your night stand."
30152,Raj,raj.
32545,Raj,"i’d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious."
32237,Raj,megan pincus.
33970,Raj,"the bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? you didn’t get any food."
33015,Raj,"nothing. i was just calling to check in, make sure she’s doing okay."
31919,Raj,really?
30351,Raj,huh. mmm. good cookies.
30144,Raj,i’m from new delhi. maybe you should find another entomologist.
32401,Raj,i can’t do that to leonard. this is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.
32291,Raj,"here, you can have your seat."
30232,Raj,"okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, i’d be kicking your butt."
32945,Raj,and i was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
33980,Raj,i thought someone looked brighter and tighter.
30392,Raj,race riots?
33734,Raj,"oh, hey, bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. the giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?"
33520,Raj,"oh, dude. the minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. i mean, they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. i love america."
30138,Raj,what would you name him?
33131,Raj,"why? you never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met amy. maybe there’s someone else out there for you."
33942,Raj,what do i have to be happy about? my life’s a wreck.
30920,Raj,you can’t come in.
32682,Raj,"yeah, i’m not quite sure how to respond."
32825,Raj,"dude, i, i think that’s nathan fillion."
31966,Raj,"she is. she’s just running a little late. you know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. she’ll be here. just give it a rest, okay?"
32597,Raj,"it was, and i may have made it seem like a bigger deal than i should have."
32321,Raj,"if she did, it would be amazing. that woman can do no wrong."
29785,Raj,who were you respecting then?
30192,Raj,i’m sad.
31616,Raj,do you think he’s building a bomb?
32826,Raj,"and he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like i do. i always did feel a connection with him. oh, i have got an idea."
32692,Raj,did you go to your prom?
31900,Raj,uncle howard. cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.
31021,Raj,"come on, sheldon, open the door."
33468,Raj,"says i was talking too much about dating claire and emily, and i accused him of being jealous."
29766,Raj,"and the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there. "
34094,Raj,"hey, what’s with him?"
30235,Raj,it means doo-doo.
30512,Raj,"fine. um, on the count of three. one, two…"
29988,Raj,"yeah-yeah, which way?"
33488,Raj,"hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot zack or wheezy little leonard? neener neener."
30167,Raj,what is your mother going to say?
30114,Raj,"yeah, like in the movies i saw growing up in india. you know, uh, four for texas, yellow rose of texas."
33795,Raj,can we not play this game?
31824,Raj,"mm, disneyland? i don’t know. with all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of india."
31880,Raj,"i was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, sir elton john."
32127,Raj,"and that’s not even the best part. see? i have one, too. check it out. you can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want."
32513,Raj,"maybe. i, i don’t know.it’s late, i should, i should go. look, i do get what you’re saying. instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, i need to work on my fear of being alone."
33123,Raj,i feel cool. like puss in boots.
33238,Raj,lack of confidence.
32387,Raj,"okay, okay, guys, new back stories. uh, penny and leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in new york. uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids."
30188,Raj,"i don’t want to go back to india. it’s hot and loud, and there’s so many people. you have no idea, they’re everywhere."
31001,Raj,"uh, a smile means something different in my country. you know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. india’s a goofy place."
30893,Raj,just that i’m definitely not gay.
31618,Raj,"i’m sorry. we can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. wait, in the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?"
30062,Raj,"oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet."
33438,Raj,really? it’s okay if i listen with you?
32510,Raj,eleven.
30623,Raj,hi.
29983,Raj,"oh, please.when it comes to terminators, you’ve got a better shot of scoring with arnold schwarzenegger."
32397,Raj,"well, give me a chance, you don’t even know me."
32604,Raj,easy. sleeping with penny.
32871,Raj,"what are you, a little kid? is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?"
31884,Raj,come in.
31586,Raj,"twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for."
32434,Raj,see? this is exactly the kind of thing i’m worried about you saying in front of her.
30930,Raj,"there it is, priya. we’re indian. we believe this stuff."
30822,Raj,"oh, yeah? what if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?"
30849,Raj,"i’ve said this before, and i’ll say it again. aquaman sucks."
29671,Raj,"you know, if we were in india this would be simpler. five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be done."
33223,Raj,let’s do this.
33831,Raj,"oh, you want to bet? you never exercise."
32688,Raj,and then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.
32390,Raj,"i’m not pouting, i’m brooding. which is how sexy men pout."
31721,Raj,what? what about the mission? you said we were a real-life landing party.
29575,Raj,and this is leonard and sheldon’s apartment. 
30791,Raj,"maybe. if it did, i’d be famous. i’d be on the cover of magazines. and then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, i’d have a big mansion."
31105,Raj,every night.
32853,Raj,"hang on. okay. given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
31360,Raj,it’s on like alderaan.
32346,Raj,have you heard back from emily?
33688,Raj,welcome.
30513,Raj,three.
33593,Raj,"whoa, i’m calling my dad, okay? he’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an obgyn. and experience with crazy ladies because of my mom."
32867,Raj,that’s okay. i can come back later.
32330,Raj,"i thought about what you said last night, and i went back on the dating web site and i was looking at this girl’s profile. she’s amazing."
32273,Raj,i don’t have plans which is why i booked time on the big telescope that night.
33319,Raj,"bye. all right. so, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. everybody’s happy. easy peasy."
30825,Raj,wait. what the hell is ding?
29624,Raj,"oh, screw princess punchali."
32937,Raj,i get it. what do you want to do?
33181,Raj,"you just say, uh, hey, siri, what time is it?"
31236,Raj,"come on, sheldon, star wars."
30322,Raj,yeah.
32789,Raj,actually there’s no proof of that.
30170,Raj,but i was summing up.
33017,Raj,"well, i try to. i certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model.  who wants to go to vegas in a real helicopter?"
31829,Raj,"no, you can’t join us. just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from."
32416,Raj,"my friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like i’m being deceitful."
32203,Raj,"yeah, you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding."
29773,Raj,"well you can’t stay with me, i have a teeny tiny apartment. "
34091,Raj,"hey, guess what. i’ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness. "
30583,Raj,"relax, it’s nyquil."
33317,Raj,"not me. ever since you admitted we had a vibe, i’ve been planning our wedding."
30631,Raj,smooth.
31428,Raj,"wow, that’s amazing."
29677,Raj,"hey, look at that.  it’s dennis kim."
31864,Raj,"whatever. i can see my little princess while i’m at work, right?"
30953,Raj,okay.
32166,Raj,"howard, the poor thing just got home from work. let me get you a glass of wine. i’ll cook dinner."
30093,Raj,"if you were standing behind me nagging, i might."
32318,Raj,can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
30200,Raj,i’m on it.
30388,Raj,we do?
30346,Raj,"yeah, me, too."
30143,Raj,ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
30495,Raj,it’s all of ours. 
31303,Raj,"oh, an exotic little treat. i was just talking to siri about peking duck, and she said she knew about four chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. her spontaneity is contagious."
33535,Raj,very well.
33575,Raj,"oh, that’s a nice one. was it yours when you were little?"
32600,Raj,great.
33012,Raj,what a baby.
30767,Raj,indy’s young sidekick from temple of doom.
32286,Raj,"there you go. all cozy wozy. here, let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. hmm. rajesh, i was dreading valentine’s day. thank you for spending it with me. yvette. cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. if i’d known it was that easy, i would have considered poisoning you months ago. oh, what should i say? oh, i know. i’ll point out her name’s yvette, and that she’s a vet. that’s hysterical. she’ll love it."
33067,Raj,"oh, not just him, you’re coming, too."
30233,Raj,"okay, you got me there, but you’re wrong about this!"
33019,Raj,we haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.
33312,Raj,"well, no, no. i, i didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out."
31813,Raj,"wait. can you at least tell me what went wrong? it’s okay. i can take anything. unless it’s something i did, or said, or am. ‘cause those are, like, my buttons."
31782,Raj,"well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?"
33822,Raj,"thank you, howard."
31033,Raj,a friend at the school of pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. he says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
32080,Raj,that’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.
32409,Raj,"but what if one of them asks me what i was up to the night before and i was with the other one? then, what, do i lie?"
32456,Raj,"all right, let’s get this over with. ew, it’s got someone’s hair on it."
34092,Raj,"hey, look, i found an ipod. "
32622,Raj,go online and look it up.
32640,Raj,"well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket."
29549,Raj,a little bird told us. apparently you are a magnificent beast. 
30480,Raj,is it eddie crispo?
32854,Raj,"ooh, uh, emily gets off work soon. why don’t the four of us go out?"
33398,Raj,really? i’m sorry. i swear i know other words.
33596,Raj,"this is my friend, bernadette. she’s pregnant, and she’s a bit worried, so i thought maybe you could talk to her."
33716,Raj,sure.
31699,Raj,"well, this is all your fault."
31971,Raj,no.
30278,Raj,lava serpent.
33183,Raj,i don’t sound like that.
31357,Raj,you know what would be great? let’s do it like the old days.
30180,Raj,but we just got tattoos. wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?
32942,Raj,you guys know the new discovery class missions that nasa’s been working on?
32632,Raj,"you know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter."
30865,Raj,"mm. last night, i had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and i bought matching side-by-side mansions. but there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. what do you think that means?"
30329,Raj,"maybe it means something different in this country. back in india, it means you’re upset with a guy named howard!"
34141,Raj,go away!
33372,Raj,"and it was gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. learn as if you were to live forever."
30505,Raj,why don’t we go after your mother?
33264,Raj,"so, uh, what were you thinking? combine their names?"
33172,Raj,sixty seconds. this is not looking good.
31694,Raj,"i say you tell alex your heart belongs to penny, i provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later i give it to her good."
33456,Raj,"totally, guys are the worst. i mean, look at me. i let emily make me a frittata and i kept the leftovers in claire’s fridge that night. i’m such a dog."
31270,Raj,"hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?"
31909,Raj,"well, i, i thought about…"
29734,Raj,"okay, leonard, put down the box, let’s talk."
30759,Raj,"oh, my god, dude. now you have to forgive him."
30441,Raj,but he’s afraid of dogs.
31568,Raj,i’m not finishing your sentence. you pulled the plug on my funk.
31251,Raj,totally you.
29958,Raj,"oh, cool, i got a sword."
32359,Raj,have you heard from howard?
34130,Raj,can i sleep here tonight?
31381,Raj,"oh yes. in my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. plus i want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here i look like six two."
30352,Raj,"that’s beautiful, dude. you should… you should write that down before someone steals it."
29756,Raj,"okay leonard, here i am at your birthday party, i don’t know where you are dude, but it’s really kick-ass. everyone is very very drunk, and uh…  oh look, there’s a girl taking her shirt off. "
33805,Raj,"well, i want information in order to improve myself."
31835,Raj,so your theme is i saw a rerun of mad men and bought some crab puffs from trader joe’s? hate to miss that.
30987,Raj,"i am making her comfortable. besides, she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway."
33322,Raj,"yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work."
33761,Raj,excuse me.
30458,Raj,"no, no, no, i’m going to have a me day. first i’m going to go to one of those spas in koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. then i’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies."
32464,Raj,"actually, i have to tell you something. these kind of movies really aren’t my thing, so, last night, i watched it just to see what i was getting myself into."
31440,Raj,"yeah, to howard. um, uh, who’s next?"
31241,Raj,that is one tough birdie.
30700,Raj,"it’s not gonna work, dude, i grew up in india, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement."
32075,Raj,his only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
34086,Raj,"hey. sorry i’m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus."
32770,Raj,"oh, another two hours to go. the wait is killing me."
30053,Raj,hello again.
32708,Raj,i’m okay.
31047,Raj,"hey! that’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. leonard may have defiled one, but i won’t have you talking smack about the other."
31353,Raj,it doesn’t have an oh in front of it.
33891,Raj,"dad, i’m trying to tell you off, and you’re ruining it with your delight and relief."
33568,Raj,"oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies."
29908,Raj,"or it turned into mustard kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue kryptonian hotdog threatening earth."
31342,Raj,"ooh, limited edition. nice."
31754,Raj,"way to make lemonade. you know, from around the corner where fudge is made."
30875,Raj,"oh, my god, i’m crying already."
29691,Raj,why? because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night’s chutney? 
32118,Raj,my name is howard. i can make your hair into diamonds. my mom is morbidly obese. everybody love me.
33129,Raj,"oh, yeah, right. sorry. my name is puss in boots. you killed my father. prepare to die."
33817,Raj,"yes, i’ll take you back."
33923,Raj,"that would be amazing. i was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in."
31098,Raj,this is the difference between eating and dining.
34126,Raj,"oh, just getting comfortable. so how long have you lived in los angeles?"
29533,Raj,"blowing the gates. control, shift, b! oh, my god, so many goblins!"
32314,Raj,screw that! i sat on the floor for seven years. i’m staying right here.
32627,Raj,and i really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think i’ve been cheating on her.
31258,Raj,how about that guy? he looks like he’d hate you.
29930,Raj,i can’t watch anymore.
33419,Raj,oh. you know what? i’m gonna let them know that i’m here with you and that they’re busted.
29809,Raj,peer review? it’s people magazine. people picked me.
29861,Raj,"damn, there’s always a catch."
31435,Raj,maybe we can go up to napa valley. they’ve got that wine train.
32737,Raj,"amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. i gave up when no one cared about my tom hanks-giving."
30788,Raj,"and when you go to a chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie."
29957,Raj,we’re on a quest through the valley of fire to acquire the sacred crown.
33139,Raj,"uh, he’s indian. we’ve already got one of those. ooh, we should find a nice latino, really round us out."
32005,Raj,who died and made you king of moments?
34066,Raj,which is?
30832,Raj,don’t yell at me!
29858,Raj,but you finished your experiment a week ago.
29679,Raj,i’d be more interested in a scene depicting spock’s conception. 
30090,Raj,where are your tools?
33458,Raj,how could you say that?
33673,Raj,"no, no, this is brand new. we haven’t even been on a proper date yet."
33648,Raj,"now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?"
31069,Raj,hell hounds. who let the satanic dogs out? who? who-who?
34044,Raj,really? you kept sending me apartment listings.
33790,Raj,"don’t do that in socks, i almost broke my neck."
31925,Raj,how are your crab cakes?
32402,Raj,"okay. penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are altair and vega. and it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the milky way."
33557,Raj,"oh, i’m not on the patent. i’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office."
31341,Raj,"would you look at this? i paid twenty five dollars to some kid on ebay for a handcrafted harry potter wand. he sent me a stick. he went into his backyard, he picked up a stick."
31148,Raj,this is fun. i’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
31366,Raj,"got him. when gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, i bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff."
31108,Raj,"well, uh, to paraphrase shakespeare, it’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography."
30988,Raj,"it, it doesn’t matter. howard has a girlfriend."
31315,Raj,"nothing, nothing."
30960,Raj,"i should say so, he appears to be a member of the nigerian royal family."
8382,Howard,thank you. how’s it going with the long-distance love affair?
6994,Howard,"they didn’t quit. they were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry mexicans."
6385,Howard,or can we?
11958,Howard,i’ll tell you later.
7913,Howard,"yeah, i know what you mean."
9125,Howard,have you guys ever noticed that sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?
9615,Howard,"wow, you’re really good at puzzles."
9095,Howard,i know.
10195,Howard,so i can shoot you with a spitball.
6533,Howard,"look, i’ve done my best but he wants to go home and i don’t know how to stop him. "
7466,Howard,"come on, sheldon. let the womenfolk chat."
10920,Howard,we’ve only been doing this 20 minutes?
11919,Howard,"yeah, exactly. not bad, but not great."
11764,Howard,"prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor."
8712,Howard,what are you doing here?
10287,Howard,"no, it vibrates. keep going."
11203,Howard,i’ll go get him.
8288,Howard,okay.
11122,Howard,"that old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose."
8939,Howard,"okay, okay, i know you’re upset, but let me share something i’ve learned since i got here. you realize how small your problems are when you’re looking down on them from space. now, come on, that’s got to make you feel better."
10261,Howard,it’s to help reopen the comic book store.
9616,Howard,"if it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake."
11142,Howard,is the foetus helping you? ‘cause that’s cheating.
6617,Howard,"well then fake it. look at me, i could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but i’m bigger than that."
8162,Howard,"sex criminals don’t have keys, ma."
10011,Howard,"hey, can i come in?"
10578,Howard,"yeah, i’m okay. let’s get started."
11057,Howard,you’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.
6507,Howard,what if they’re women?
10453,Howard,"i know. i get it. when i was in the soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward earth at 17,000 miles per hour…"
10233,Howard,"thanks. i’m proud of me, too."
9523,Howard,you have her?
9412,Howard,"yeah, last time i was here, i was just a scrawny little nerd."
11416,Howard,"well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think."
10599,Howard,"yes, but i mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the transformers and the thundercats for control of a bra i had found in the woods."
9077,Howard,"sheldon, i know stephen hawking. i worked with him."
8253,Howard,"yeah. no one can hide from me, not waldo, not carmen san diego, not even topless natalie portman."
8568,Howard,"how about that? after all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes."
7448,Howard,"i know, but she’s not you."
11267,Howard,a lot.
10759,Howard,and i wish leonard never told me. he’s the bad guy here.
10948,Howard,look at this. trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.
11502,Howard,you’re in a good mood.
11319,Howard,"hi, colonel williams, how can i help you? what? oh, uh, yes, he is from india. no, i don’t know his immigration status. relax, i’m still on hold. speaking. okay, sure, i can meet with you on thursday. caltech is fine. yeah, and may i ask what this is about? i may not?"
6674,Howard,and kreplach.
10604,Howard,"yeah, what?"
7195,Howard,shh!
7405,Howard,it was my uncle murray’s funeral. we were all back at my aunt barbara’s house. our eyes locked over the pickled herring. we never meant for it to happen.
6245,Howard,"what, are all the girls in the bathroom?"
9299,Howard,we’re not with him.
10701,Howard,hey.
10781,Howard,i think it’s a tyre.
6258,Howard,no.
9285,Howard,that is not true. all i did was build a robot.
10770,Howard,"wow, okay."
6892,Howard,"yeah, still funny, raj."
11441,Howard,"imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am i gonna open this trunk?"
10144,Howard,what’s wrong with your car?
9164,Howard,not me.
6937,Howard,when did that happen?
11190,Howard,"and you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?"
11788,Howard,that’s good.
8809,Howard,"thank you, sheldon."
7460,Howard,fair enough. when’s your break?
8204,Howard,"that’s got to be fun for you, huh? watching hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister’s mouth?"
8656,Howard,i wonder what he wants.
7220,Howard,i’m actually much morelost than he is.
10250,Howard,"you know, when i was a kid, i loved going there, but i could never get a ride."
6389,Howard,"interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem. "
6553,Howard,remember to sit on your hands a bit so they’re warm. 
8640,Howard,"yeah, it’s great, but i told you, i don’t get to pick my nickname. it has to come from the other astronauts."
7611,Howard,"you know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn lieutenant uhura panties, that kind of stuff."
7444,Howard,"come on, katee, don’t make it sound so cheap."
9979,Howard,you just went to the bathroom.
10677,Howard,yeah.
8149,Howard,"i do sometimes get a bit carried away, don’t i?"
9538,Howard,"uh, fifteen or higher."
11648,Howard,"oh, you’re a genius."
10596,Howard,"we’re not selling it, it’s mine."
9265,Howard,who the hell is svaty vaclav?
7177,Howard,"okay, who had leonard flames out with penny in less than 24 hours”?"
10775,Howard,we are going to me-hi-co.
6459,Howard,yeah. 
6531,Howard,"okay, you have to understand something, we’re in a hospital right now. "
7666,Howard,that wasn’t a no.
6954,Howard,that’s summer glau.
8430,Howard,oh.
7367,Howard,you think so?
10397,Howard,sure. we could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.
7445,Howard,"thank you. so, shall we get started?"
10486,Howard,let’s see. how about emily or cinnamon?
11910,Howard,"uh, pretty much any way i say that is going to hurt his feelings."
10125,Howard,welcome to team putz.
6672,Howard,i have chorrr.
7600,Howard,not just the finger. the moving finger.
11422,Howard,he’s in our hot tub drinking our wine.
6466,Howard,can i get a hallelujah. 
6640,Howard,"and he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties."
7757,Howard,why?
6557,Howard,"oh, hey, leonard, how was your date?"
9081,Howard,tell him he sounds like that.
7590,Howard,looks like you ran a red light on marengo avenue at 9:30 p.m. on november 16. they got you on a traffic camera. nice picture.
11194,Howard,but we have to set some boundaries.
6400,Howard,"they formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing knotsbury farm. "
6834,Howard,yeah. they sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.
9467,Howard,"me, too. if i’d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats."
10698,Howard,suicide.
9721,Howard,"so i won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un."
8739,Howard,"yep, one sec.  ah, good. ma would have killed me if she’d found out i’d broke my retainer."
9902,Howard,"i’m sorry, what?"
8881,Howard,hey mike?
8418,Howard,"hey, ma, how about a little privacy?"
7041,Howard,i’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
11063,Howard,"it says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely."
10982,Howard,spineless.
9865,Howard,poor bert. that guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.
7651,Howard,where’s 70 children when you need ‘em?
9520,Howard,"well, maybe with the first one. but kids are like pancakes. the first one’s always a throwaway. how’s this look?"
8522,Howard,who had money on faints?
11428,Howard,"oh, i mean, i know you’re pregnant. i just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby."
7091,Howard,"okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, i’m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology."
7328,Howard,you live with your mother?
9941,Howard,sure.
11784,Howard,i guess. it wasn’t until college that i learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.
9531,Howard,"we’ll be fine, watch. suddenly, a spectral shape rises from koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says,  well, i’m just a tree, but if i were you, i’d listen to your ghost friend."
11473,Howard,"so, when do we meet her?"
9947,Howard,"okay, so i wasn’t exactly john glenn up there, but i’ve changed. i’m a different man now. yeah, and i’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think i can handle it."
8050,Howard,"yeah, she seems happier. why wouldn’t we be?"
8623,Howard,she is gonna break his heart.
11409,Howard,"well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do. in fact, what’s this between your toes?"
11407,Howard,you bet i did.
11446,Howard,"oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the gps can take us to the nearest emergency room."
10717,Howard,sorry we have to do this.
9527,Howard,"come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play d&d like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?"
7191,Howard,"what’s the matter, you chicken?"
11571,Howard,"with pay, sucka. forgot the baby, still new to this."
9591,Howard,"sex? really? i mean, that’s just your solution to everything. "
9813,Howard,"i do know to go get ’em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when i’m going and getting them."
10265,Howard,"well, i don’t like to talk about it."
7422,Howard,"to be honest, i was hoping at least second base."
9135,Howard,don’t you know his schedule?
6342,Howard,"look at this, everyone went chimp. "
7931,Howard,"yeah, well, raj, i just want to say that i’d never betray your trust. unlike leonard, i respect you."
7499,Howard,"we were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that i have a problem with her hanging out with you."
8071,Howard,"so right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call…"
6269,Howard,"i do not, my mother lives with me. "
6661,Howard,"howard wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the international space station’s liquid waste disposal system."
6905,Howard,war is hell.
6165,Howard,"hang on, there really is a lady here?"
9728,Howard,"everything we need to make jewellery moulds. here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down."
8493,Howard,no?
7040,Howard,"no, he may not."
10869,Howard,oh.
7763,Howard,why?
8046,Howard,leonard’s buying.
10919,Howard,"all right, i think i’m getting into a groove here. this isn’t so bad."
8586,Howard,"okay, we’re going to roll up this newspaper."
6898,Howard,"oh, leslie, thank god."
7079,Howard,"seriously, you think this is the size of a baby’s arm?"
9000,Howard,did you get a sea lion while i was gone?
10651,Howard,with my honeybunch.
7464,Howard,"bernadette, say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles."
6542,Howard,"yeah, that’s why i did it. "
10522,Howard,that is a good point. but i didn’t marry you for good points. i married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous i’m being.
11135,Howard,"honey, this is fine."
9577,Howard,"what were they thinking, putting doctor octopus’s mind in spider-man’s body?"
11464,Howard,"see, i’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, i waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain."
9684,Howard,sorry we’re so late. bernadette got stuck at work.
7395,Howard,"oh i don’t know, 50, 55."
10516,Howard,not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.
11517,Howard,"guys, you heard her, go see what she wants."
11812,Howard,"no, it’s if you want to have fun, start with one. yours we think, but we do not say. all right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it."
11432,Howard,hi.
9366,Howard,"yeah, one second. come here. i want to show you something."
11195,Howard,the three of us aren’t having this baby. just the two of us.
7263,Howard,"oh, he usually comes to my house. right, pal?  all right, this year, you don’t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. i don’t even chew it. i swallow it like pills."
6505,Howard,he came with a manual. 
7147,Howard,i can’t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
7216,Howard,it’d help if you weren’t drinking light beer.
9400,Howard,"all right. well, i’ll see you around."
6570,Howard,shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire? 
9215,Howard,"thanks, sheldon. i’ll try that with my father-in-law."
8284,Howard,then the studio must have real faith in it.
6183,Howard,"he can’t talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented goddess!"
10715,Howard,"i mean, for a while, everything was vampires. now it’s all zombies. i wonder what the next monster fad will be."
10052,Howard,"okay, i’ll say it. i was on the way to pick her up. my stomach felt a little funny. when i got there, i asked if i could use her bathroom."
9493,Howard,just a little? that’s great.
10783,Howard,every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.
8445,Howard,"no joke. oh, she says she’s sorry she’s late."
8795,Howard,"it’s not her fault. she’s getting hormone replacement therapy. makes her crazy horny. check this out, i got sheldon to wear the french maid’s costume."
6964,Howard,what’s going on?
10153,Howard,i said well past it.
8388,Howard,"oh, come on, tell me i’m wrong."
10634,Howard,"well, i hope i get to see you again."
7417,Howard,and she was my second cousin.
6361,Howard,"hey, i’m damaged too. how about a hug for howie? "
10031,Howard,what’s this?
9883,Howard,"not the same hulk. ferrigno, bana, norton and ruffalo."
9058,Howard,fine.
6838,Howard,"i’m not sure yet. you know, george clooney has one now!"
10026,Howard,maybe. but how great is game of thrones?
8514,Howard,"nope. she says if i don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike. it would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger, but still."
7439,Howard,"okay, now you’re just being unrealistic. anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be."
8921,Howard,"okay, uh, fine. bernie, i have to go pick up my mother. i’ll be right back."
11749,Howard,you sure?
10586,Howard,certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.
10094,Howard,yeah.
6613,Howard,"poverty? your father’s a gynaecologist, he drives a bentley."
9697,Howard,make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and i don’t want to blow the surprise.
7717,Howard,beg pardon?
9893,Howard,do what?
8194,Howard,you have hypo-allergenic detergent?
11879,Howard,"you girl’s talk, i’m going to take my scooter out for a little spin. "
9381,Howard,"me, too. how about we blow off dessert, go home early, i’ll do that laundry."
6352,Howard,stay low. bear left. now keep true.
6282,Howard,"neither do i. doogie howser’s been off the air for like, twenty years. "
7294,Howard,"well, i guess game’s over."
11954,Howard,"i think i wrote a letter to santa claus every day. and then on christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon."
9382,Howard,i love you.
6944,Howard,what’s the plan?
8319,Howard,my family is the history of heart disease. there’s a cave painting in france of one of my ancestors doing this .
7863,Howard,i just have a question. does bernadette ever talk about me?
9079,Howard,"that’s ridiculous. not to mention, your american accent is terrible."
9427,Howard,you know what we should do? we should show the closet to sheldon.
8938,Howard,"hey, look, this pen is floating. how crazy is that?"
9296,Howard,car.
7077,Howard,"grow up, raj,there’s no place for truth on the internet. just go, i’ll catch up with you."
7935,Howard,"thankyou, and i’m sorry about your phone. and thanksgiving. and while we’re at it, you don’t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of july."
6239,Howard,a boy-girl party?
7712,Howard,"that’s why we moved halo night here. look, i brought my mom’s chicken soup."
8067,Howard,"well, hang on. let’s see where he’s going."
8315,Howard,"no, i did what any son would do."
10414,Howard,"you mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?"
6565,Howard,that’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia. 
8109,Howard,how would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like angelina jolie?
8122,Howard,"i know. the only thing is, i’m gonna be gone for two years."
10344,Howard,"stuart, we have to talk. this thing with you and my mom, i hate it. it’s making me crazy. you and i were friends for years, and now you’re bringing my mother to a party i’m going to? what the hell?"
9419,Howard,"quick, pull the fire alarm. let’s get out of here."
8322,Howard,you’d think that. but no.
6777,Howard,no.
9047,Howard,i don’t talk about it every minute.
10678,Howard,sheldon.
11911,Howard,someone’s in the kitchen i know-ow-ow-ow
11971,Howard,"hey, what’s up?"
10546,Howard,what’s wrong?
7420,Howard,"well, see, it took two years for the snail to…  not important."
7847,Howard,bernadette? what are you doing here?
11408,Howard,you know what’s weird? how turned on you are right now.
11595,Howard,"well, you don’t need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize."
9465,Howard,"actually, i don’t want to know. i want all of them to be true."
9597,Howard,fine.
11242,Howard,"um, guys? were there any nuts in that food?"
7696,Howard,"sheldon, come on."
11704,Howard,"maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes. fine, what should we do?"
7879,Howard,thank you.
8944,Howard,you can’t catch a computer virus.
8870,Howard,"so, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. now, i know what you’re going to say, i made a commitment to bernadette and to your family and i’ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. well, message heard and understood. mission cancelled. thank you."
7703,Howard,"whoa, whoa, whoa. you heard the man. where’s your throat cultures? kidding. sit down."
6397,Howard,"ooh, more details about the new star trek film. there’s going to be a scene depicting spock’s birth. "
7730,Howard,preparing to fire laser at the moon.
7776,Howard,i’m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill sheldon.
10989,Howard,what?
11348,Howard,i’m not even sure that’s possible.
10121,Howard,"well, whose fault is that? i wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, i’m nice, i want to take care of people."
21700,Howard,"i can’t speak for these guys, but i’m sitting on my tushie. it’s a joke."
9933,Howard,what do you think i said? i said yes. why do you look surprised?
8360,Howard,"yeah, ha-ha. first of all, i’m not threatened by my fiancée’s success. i’m proud of her. and secondly, i have my own career."
11470,Howard,"huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli."
9963,Howard,"listen, i was thinking you and i could probably try to be better friends."
10517,Howard,why don’t you just clean out the whole room? take the string art clown i made her in third grade and the ribbon i got in swim class for putting my face in the water.
6620,Howard,we just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.
11507,Howard,when would you move in?
9633,Howard,love on the rocks. 
8711,Howard,no. wait. send more underwear.
10089,Howard,i think he’s taking this professor proton thing pretty hard.
11241,Howard,son of a bitch.
11538,Howard,yeah. i was 20 years old before i figured out tootsie rolls weren’t naturally warm.
7756,Howard,"all right, you can have a hot chocolate."
8588,Howard,"she’s just kidding, boys and girls. everyone gets cake."
10217,Howard,what’s wrong with the way i run?
9210,Howard,"i’d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet."
10525,Howard,no.
11973,Howard,can’t believe we forgot to tell him.
10363,Howard,you don’t look okay.
8327,Howard,"bernie, it’s not you. she’s just set in her ways."
9643,Howard,"hi, penny."
10098,Howard,"thanks for lifting my spirits. next time, try lifting the box."
8680,Howard,"got it, got it. will you e-mail me that list?"
10535,Howard,"oh, okay, great. so, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet earth."
9868,Howard,you want us to talk to him?
6849,Howard,"okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and… "
11781,Howard,finally get halley down?
11168,Howard,raj. he really wants to see this movie.
10843,Howard,hey.
8103,Howard,sorry. i just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.
6614,Howard,"oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons."
9751,Howard,"you know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin."
6957,Howard,"fair enough. but then let me move on to number two, unlike you, i can actually talk to women when i’m sober."
11827,Howard,"all right, very funny."
7205,Howard,you’re such a girl. they’re just bugs.
6589,Howard,"so, how do you explain the ten years before penny?"
6703,Howard,"it was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in siberia, i took it an hour out of its way, tops."
8221,Howard,i thought you had more important things to think about.
6664,Howard,i do. i love me a cup of joe.
11741,Howard,four.
6502,Howard,told you not to ask. 
9892,Howard,okay. we’re officially not going to comic-con.
10930,Howard,"oh. i made my wife come down, too."
9662,Howard,"no, no, listen to me. sheldon misunderstood. what i meant was, if we worked together, there’d be too much of me for you, not the other way around."
10751,Howard,i don’t know. sounds pretty bad. penny’s back in her apartment all by herself.
10438,Howard,"uh, maybe it’s just stunned."
7882,Howard,"you wouldn’t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy’s large? yeah, forget it. not important. so, are you seeing anyone?"
9606,Howard,"so, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?"
10628,Howard,"no, i got it."
11235,Howard,yeah.
11961,Howard,hi.
11886,Howard,i’ll talk to you later. 
6773,Howard,"yeah, what about kryptonian pit stains?"
7146,Howard,there’s no time for a crossbow. find me an icicle.
9879,Howard,great.
10500,Howard,"hey, your paper got mentioned on the quantum diaries physics blog."
10127,Howard,"two, and i know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them."
8651,Howard,not now!
11501,Howard,"all right, we’re done. it’s offensive."
7238,Howard,"yeah, i’d like the mean little skull, please."
11842,Howard,"i’m happy about it, but, i mean, it’s not like i did much. i mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you."
11839,Howard,not really.
8473,Howard,smart. whisper so the deaf chick can’t hear you.
8481,Howard,"oh, well, it’s really cool. you fly to moscow, they take you out to kazakhstan, and then you get into a russian soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. or just sits there on the launch pad because the kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market."
7779,Howard,yes.
9944,Howard,you’re supposed to do that.
10991,Howard,no one.
11051,Howard,"good, i don’t know where we keep the strainer."
6371,Howard,sheldon.
10172,Howard,"yes, but when they’re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles."
9417,Howard,"no, but i was in the rocket. i didn’t actually…"
6315,Howard,"let’s roll. hey, nice suit."
7631,Howard,"i’m sorry, ma, i have to stay late at the office."
9244,Howard,you’re right. oh! i should do this.
9259,Howard,i’m your idiot. forever.
9156,Howard,what kind of secret does sheldon have to encrypt?
7505,Howard,"i was just repeating what sheldon said. let’s not get off topic, bernadette, i need to apologize. i was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with."
8546,Howard,it’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.
9002,Howard,oh. are you kidding? every minute of every…
9988,Howard,i’m gonna need that bag back.
9630,Howard,never looking back again. 
11294,Howard,"hmm. we request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. that’s weird."
8513,Howard,"thanks, but i watch the charlie brown christmas special every year, so i get the gist."
10309,Howard,let’s not talk about this in front of our friends.
8009,Howard,they were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
6541,Howard,are you mad?
8852,Howard,"yeah, well, why wouldn’t i be? you know, i’m marrying the girl of my dreams, and i finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon.  oh, hang on. oh, it’s nasa. wolowitz. oh! hi, dave. what’s up? no kidding. really? well, that’s great news. great, great news. all right, i’ll watch my e-mail for the details. okay, talk soon."
6581,Howard,"please, i’m begging you, go to sleep."
11303,Howard,"you’re right. we turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us."
10702,Howard,"there’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support."
11002,Howard,of course not. he drove us crazy. like when you were gonna make that pie and stuart ate all the blueberries.
11688,Howard,yeah.
9734,Howard,how am i ruining anything? i’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.
7865,Howard,"she saw that, huh?"
8738,Howard,nice to meet you.
7329,Howard,"ooh, rough. okay, check this out. my mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so i wouldn’t pick up a disease from the other children."
6782,Howard,where were you?
11233,Howard,"tell me about it. i’ve had it with raj, too."
9053,Howard,"yeah, sure, whatever."
11530,Howard,"just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. stuart, stop driving like an old man. speed it up a little."
6893,Howard,but what about the creek bed?
10631,Howard,"thank you. come on. and i’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy."
9239,Howard,"i don’t know, for them to die of natural causes."
11693,Howard,"hang on. bernie, can i outsource my chores to an indian guy?"
8123,Howard,"that’s what we’re here to talk to you about. you see, bernadette has needs."
6997,Howard,"1,000 friggin’ penny blossoms."
11935,Howard,i love watching raj and sheldon try to work together.
8894,Howard,"no! when i eat froot loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!"
8260,Howard,"yeah, she’s kind of a wheel savant."
9261,Howard,"okay, guys, let’s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front."
8917,Howard,"fantastic four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. the one where mr. fantastic and the invisible girl get married."
8379,Howard,"pretty sweet, huh? this little baby set the university back 175 grand."
8771,Howard,he even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
10419,Howard,"okay, here’s the plan. i’m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up."
7173,Howard,again.
9583,Howard,"really? tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying."
11654,Howard,that’s a turbo.
6285,Howard,"me too. of course, it speaks to me culturally. "
11042,Howard,"sorry, bernie and i are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what i mean."
6740,Howard,how do we decide that?
6500,Howard,don’t ask.
6247,Howard,"no thanks, peanuts, i can’t afford to swell up in these tights. "
6686,Howard,and they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?
6280,Howard,"son of a bitch, medpack, i need a medpack! "
7593,Howard,"wow. uh, stan lee, or you in court? uh, if this was sophie’s choice it would’ve been a much shorter movie. no."
8386,Howard,"are you insane? with high-speed internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth."
8740,Howard,yeah. sure. how are things going?
6680,Howard,look at those women.
7727,Howard,"oh, it’s very simple. leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me, while penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye."
10455,Howard,"you work in pharmaceuticals, don’t you have anything you can give him?"
8354,Howard,"sheldon, yes! everybody’s a doctor but me!"
7428,Howard,"you know, it’s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship."
9100,Howard,let go of whatever piece of food you’re holding.
7786,Howard,"okay, i can’t believe this needs to be said out loud. no pulling, no saws, no torches."
6465,Howard,"ha-ha, not your eyebrows? "
11086,Howard,"well, look at this. i bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. he can have all the kids he wants."
11617,Howard,i don’t know. what difference does it make?
8621,Howard,"oh, let me try the voice recognition."
11225,Howard,just drop it.
6870,Howard,"yes. koothrappali’s going to wet himself, i’m gonna throw up, sheldon’s gonna run away, and you’re going to die. shall we synchronize our watches?"
7701,Howard,"a, are you kidding me? and b, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?"
11460,Howard,"don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face."
10610,Howard,"one-zero. two. three. four. five-nothing. wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?"
10728,Howard,"buddy, other than jenny craig, you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life."
7453,Howard,"yeah, i came to talk to bernadette. she’s working today, right?"
9629,Howard,on the boats and on the planes. 
8448,Howard,i don’t know how to spell it.
6677,Howard,"kreplach, a hearty klingon… dumpling."
10342,Howard,"i didn’t take her, she was a chaperone."
6224,Howard,"not so fast, remember the south still has two infantry divisions, plus superman and godzilla."
6312,Howard,oh no he dit’nt!
8775,Howard,no!
7054,Howard,"i do, all the time."
9145,Howard,thank you.
7158,Howard,we had to.
11494,Howard,i have no problem calling him.
11180,Howard,"oh. well, i guess that’s kind of sweet."
8485,Howard,"all right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. what is it?"
10272,Howard,"probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back."
8565,Howard,"that’s quite a list. i can’t read your handwriting, what’s that word?"
6779,Howard,"doesn’t do anything for me. if i was gonna go that way, i’m more of a zac ephron kinda guy."
10868,Howard,"yeah. yeah, i feel like an archaeologist. indiana jones and the single-family dwelling. hey. look. found a seashell."
11312,Howard,maybe to you. you didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.
6728,Howard,my mother is so gonna love her.
11466,Howard,"you’re up, blabby."
11751,Howard,"look, something’s going on with bernadette. she say anything to you?"
11317,Howard,"all right, all right."
10108,Howard,we get a nurse. preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.
11265,Howard,"you could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it’ll run forever."
11887,Howard,is he here? 
8733,Howard,"come on, who is it?"
7849,Howard,"okay, i’m a little confused here."
9723,Howard,"you know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. you’d be able to make much cooler stuff."
10439,Howard,"oh, no. i killed it. oh, not again."
7886,Howard,"penny, can we have a little privacy?"
8552,Howard,"mmm, make it two."
8634,Howard,"open the pod bay doors, hal."
6231,Howard,how can she take your order when you’re too neurotic to talk to her.
7229,Howard,okay.
8020,Howard,"a jar with a big spider in it, of course. bravery test. first one to take his hand out is the sidekick."
11305,Howard,"i’m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam."
6526,Howard,"okay, i get it, i know how the world works, how about if i were to introduce you  to the man who freed your people. "
7890,Howard,"okay, fine. i’ll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the internet where the name wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. but the only reason i go there, the only reason i’ve ever gone there is because i don’t have a real woman in my life. you happy?"
6194,Howard,"alright, just a few more feet, and…. here we are gentlemen, the gates of elzebub."
10137,Howard,"don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?"
11640,Howard,"i don’t know, but if he yells it’s alive, we run."
6487,Howard,"then you are in for a treat. behold, an ordinary cane. "
9655,Howard,"i’m copying leonard. when he does this to penny, they have sex and watch monty python."
10423,Howard,why do you keep assuming it was me?
6281,Howard,guess whose parents just got broadband. 
11056,Howard,"to make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. if it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. yeah."
11048,Howard,"you’re welcome. um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?"
11572,Howard,"all right, got halley to sleep. "
11584,Howard,"okay, space a3, here we go. it’s squeaking. mark it."
10190,Howard,it’s an inverted cycloid.
11523,Howard,i’m the father.
11498,Howard,do you think this is in poor taste?
8859,Howard,but what about all the plans and the guests?
8064,Howard,what’s that? some weird sex thing?
7138,Howard,"okay, why?"
11370,Howard,you wanted him awake.
10004,Howard,"well, did she see you in the window?"
11520,Howard,"oh, man, this is really happening. you doin’ okay?"
6633,Howard,"it can’t be racist, he’s a beloved character on the simpsons."
8252,Howard,"good news, gentlemen, i found our hacker."
6283,Howard,i bet they love scrubs.
7805,Howard,"thank you, sir."
11634,Howard,it’s so peaceful without him here. can i ask you how much that cost?
10370,Howard,"they always say the children aren’t to blame, but, come on."
8111,Howard,"look. listen to this one. does einstein’s theory explain why time flies when you’re having fun, but when you’re listening to dr. cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?"
8853,Howard,it looks like i’m going into space after all.
8946,Howard,"okay, here it is. bernadette and i are starting a life together and…"
10390,Howard,"oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. i dated it all through sixth grade."
11218,Howard,you sure you don’t want to come watch game of thrones with us?
10068,Howard,hey. thanks for coming to hang out.
11737,Howard,"well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler, it’ll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction."
10540,Howard,ma? i’m sorry i didn’t take you to the airport. i just want you to know that i’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. and i promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.
7583,Howard,that’s crazy. stan lee had nothing to do with batman.
8190,Howard,"wow, indeed."
8521,Howard,we can’t beat him. he’s just too smart.
10431,Howard,"well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out."
8306,Howard,"ma, i’m home! where are you?"
10117,Howard,"shh, i just got her to sleep."
9551,Howard,are you kidding me? how often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?
8247,Howard,maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.
10162,Howard,"now, i never thought i’d say this, but i’m kind of excited to see sheldon."
9556,Howard,"you’re right, you’re right. i’m really proud of you, and i’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. and space beats water."
9425,Howard,they’re just coming over for dinner. no one’s gonna look in the closet.
9098,Howard,"thank you, i only put it on the list two weeks ago. okay, i see what you’re getting at. how about this weekend i’ll box up all my things and move them to our place."
11576,Howard,"yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that’s why i bought the rug. "
6694,Howard,"one of us, one of us."
21718,Howard,you’re waiting for the elevator?
9636,Howard,"hey, she got the way to move me, cherry,"
11906,Howard,i got your text. how bad is… oy.
6348,Howard,i’m not going in there.
7726,Howard,she dumped you?
7745,Howard,"whatever. right now, dr. sheldon cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. greetings, fellow life-form…"
11565,Howard,"well, i’d say that’s thinking outside the box, but, come on."
7572,Howard,i heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
11187,Howard,i’m surprised he let us conceive without him.
8152,Howard,"well, gotta go."
11293,Howard,"thanks. hey, i just got an e-mail from the u.s. air force."
8664,Howard,"i know, it’s not on my wedding diet. i don’t care."
8129,Howard,sexually.
6176,Howard,so you’ll think about it?
9881,Howard,really?
11612,Howard,"thanks, ladies, this was fun. let’s not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night."
6635,Howard,lucky?
9416,Howard,"no, but i did go to the international space station."
6657,Howard,oh.
6432,Howard,do you have $800?
7495,Howard,me? no. i may have mentioned that it’s a little inappropriate to be asking another man’s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.
11545,Howard,"exactly. also like the comet, bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years."
8356,Howard,"sure, but i’m going out with bernadette. it’ll just be you and my mother."
6520,Howard,excuse me.
10234,Howard,let’s do it.
10509,Howard,"how do you do, mr. i’ll-admit-that’s-pretty-cool?"
9945,Howard,hang on. that was just me joking around.
11016,Howard,sheldon cooper apologized to me
11525,Howard,"no, we’re keeping it a surprise."
7866,Howard,let me ask you something else. is she seeing anybody?
10729,Howard,"that’s not the same thing. emily’s a person. stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for."
10938,Howard,"all right. this thing’s bigger than you and me, band’s back together."
7170,Howard,thank you kindly.
10012,Howard,"that was an hour ago, sheldon. a jew sits in front of a house in texas that long, for sale signs start to go up. i take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom."
6437,Howard,if we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator. 
8831,Howard,yeah?
10030,Howard,you’re reading cosmo?
6972,Howard,"and did you know the word “pumpernickel” comes from the german words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?"
10689,Howard,"well, i, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?"
7301,Howard,"so, have you talked to penny yet?"
7197,Howard,are you crazy? we can’t go down an empty elevator shaft.
6629,Howard,"hey, good news, you don’t have to sulk about penny any more, look, there are hundreds of croatian women just waiting for you to contact them."
10976,Howard,bernie and i are getting the house ready for the remodel. we could always use an extra pair of hands.
7006,Howard,"oh, actually i’m, uh, living with a woman in altadena. purely platonic, she’s also my maid."
21707,Howard,fine. and it’s a dickey.
7713,Howard,who’s that
11084,Howard,this isn’t a joke.
11376,Howard,that was painful to watch.
6984,Howard,i think i bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.
11567,Howard,is it okay if i get some sleep?
8544,Howard,i have a masters degree from m.i.t.
10160,Howard,who cares? you wouldn’t care if i slept with your mom?
11243,Howard,well just a feeling.
10714,Howard,hey.
7936,Howard,good news. i made it onto the team for the new defence department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.
8828,Howard,what is this?
8989,Howard,"step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. i’ll leave the door unlocked."
6436,Howard,"it’s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound. "
8377,Howard,damn those sons of bitches!
11334,Howard,and my cousin’s a lawyer.
10762,Howard,"bernadette and i have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things."
7718,Howard,what the frak?
8553,Howard,"we’re not wearing cowboy hats, sheldon. it looks ridiculous."
7277,Howard,guess i should have called.
9343,Howard,"hey, i got a favour to ask."
6532,Howard,"leonard’s fine. i’m fine, thanks for asking, by the way. "
8317,Howard,"what can i tell you? after i found the courage to put her pants back on, i was unstoppable."
7974,Howard,how about the guy who gets a prostate exam from wolverine?
10221,Howard,are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?
6261,Howard,"well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse."
7331,Howard,corolla!
10216,Howard,"thank you, that would be great."
6725,Howard,"yes, i was bad. maybe she’ll spank me. can we please move on?"
9539,Howard,"seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. the-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now ogre thanksgiving is ruined."
7512,Howard,because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.
7087,Howard,thank you!
7240,Howard,"i know, but it was cold. ow, ow, ow!"
10682,Howard,"no red and yellow, no red and yellow."
6630,Howard,"i’ll lend you my user name, it’s wealthybigpenis."
10906,Howard,"it’s an actual girl, and she’s really pretty."
11789,Howard,she’s great. look.
10804,Howard,footprints on the moon.
8903,Howard,"i’m sorry, ma… bernadette. ma… burna… you’re ma bernadette."
9140,Howard,can’t you face the other way and listen?
8628,Howard,"check it out, press release from nasa."
11368,Howard,thanks again for breakfast.
6983,Howard,you underestimate me.
7678,Howard,"oh, god, this is good."
8511,Howard,"right, right."
8537,Howard,what?
7740,Howard,excuse me?
10921,Howard,just because you have that accent doesn’t mean what you say isn’t stupid.
9472,Howard,you ph.d’s gonna go suck up like kripke?
7982,Howard,"how could that be a miss? c-6 was a hit, c-8 was a hit. part of your starship has to be on c-7."
9444,Howard,yep.
8786,Howard,"well, i thought i’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles."
9040,Howard,"you know, people say the soyuz capsule was a lemon. but, hey, that baby got me to space and back."
6654,Howard,what?
10410,Howard,we should get going to amy’s.
9431,Howard,colour’s fine.
11588,Howard,"then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea."
8396,Howard,"oh, yeah."
11219,Howard,"i’m not sure if i’m hoping for a boy or a girl. i mean, if it’s a boy, i’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. which means i’m gonna have to google how to play catch. if it’s a girl, i mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are."
10691,Howard,i’m an mit-trained engineer. i’ve built components for the space station.
8309,Howard,"besides food, did you get along? did you talk?"
10805,Howard,so did i.
9475,Howard,you guys going to professor tupperman’s memorial?
11840,Howard,"no. then you’ll get all sexed up and i’m not in the mood. i mean, an entire year wasted."
9990,Howard,"thank you, sheldon."
8030,Howard,one-two-three-go? that’s for babies.
11374,Howard,"well, this probably won’t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?"
11133,Howard,"well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we’re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally."
9870,Howard,of course we tell him she’s a lesbian.
8295,Howard,"nice. okay, rook to transporter pad. and he comes out at leonard’s queen’s bishop"
8701,Howard,"yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens."
9876,Howard,"five, four, three, two, one. "
7025,Howard,"tell me about it. look, a new batman belt buckle."
11497,Howard,i’m conducting a quick survey. do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?
10346,Howard,do you like her because you both have red hair?
6969,Howard,"hi, i’m the small package good things come in."
11239,Howard,she does not.
6971,Howard,i’ll give you a little clue. my favourite sandwich? salami on pumpernickel.
9836,Howard,"aw, he’s already taking after uncle shelly."
9043,Howard,you know where’s there’s a lot of nothing.
7898,Howard,did penny tell you about that?
7951,Howard,but you love that spot.
7027,Howard,"yes, but i saw it from the front."
8374,Howard,maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.
10224,Howard,you realize this isn’t one of those times i want you to exaggerate how long something is.
9702,Howard,"yeah, but she’s at the hospital in quarantine."
8495,Howard,"hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when i was 11. we never saw him again."
7543,Howard,"a little jealous, are we?"
11994,Howard,"oh, wow. don’t let him get away."
6873,Howard,okay.  
11254,Howard,"you know, i don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out."
6592,Howard,like who?
7574,Howard,"oh, man!"
7132,Howard,so you guys are seriously considering this?
11808,Howard,"okay, well, how about, oh, i teach you some close-up magic."
10626,Howard,"bernadette, weird things are happening out here."
9664,Howard,"for the love of god, why?"
11469,Howard,this isn’t complicated. do you love amy?
8002,Howard,hey.
11829,Howard,"all right, you’re freaking me out."
6305,Howard,public access enabled. 
10761,Howard,250 dollars an hour. why?
9982,Howard,"i’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things."
10887,Howard,but what are you looking for?
10827,Howard,"you make an excellent point. ooh, i think i’m getting a runner’s high."
11857,Howard,a stranger just lured sheldon away with a candy bar.
10183,Howard,"since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. however, i know you believe in the many worlds interpretation, so i’ll say that. now do you think i’m smart enough?"
8947,Howard,ma…
11698,Howard,"dinner’s almost ready. if you like meatloaf, i’m sure you’ll like its cousin, bowl of meat."
8187,Howard,i don’t know. she hasn’t responded to my email yet.
6309,Howard,"i don’t know, sheldon, those topical conferences on bowes-einstein condensates parties are legendary. "
8569,Howard,completely empty box. if you’d like to examine it?
7595,Howard,"awesome. mine says, to my friend, howard, from stan lee, excelsior!"
6902,Howard,all the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.
6450,Howard,will you forget dibs! 
8774,Howard,"you don’t seem to be understanding the english word no. maybe a different language will help. russian, nyet. chinese, bu. japanese, iie. klingon, qo. binary coded ascii, 0110111001101111."
10356,Howard,yeah.
11626,Howard,"well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly i know my way around tiny things."
9114,Howard,"fine, let’s go."
8963,Howard,"you’re out of your mind,sheldon."
7634,Howard,don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies!
9347,Howard,"yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. you pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. you push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. your children, grandchildren. meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote beverly hills chihuahua. then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to marie callender’s, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot."
9794,Howard,you’re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?
8464,Howard,okay.
11622,Howard,okay. how about if i eat like this?
7875,Howard,"will you talk to her, see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together?"
6569,Howard,who is it?
9753,Howard,"you can’t let her know you’re hurting. you know, the key is confidence."
9552,Howard,what the hell? i thought i was your best friend.
8133,Howard,i’m in!
11514,Howard,"mm, i know. it’s really making me lose respect for both of them."
11796,Howard,it’s halley. unless somebody else put an x on the bottom of their kid’s foot.
8435,Howard,you mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?
6448,Howard,"hang on, i need that to complete my justice society of america collection."
11482,Howard,here he comes.
10454,Howard,a story can do two things.
7208,Howard,yes!
7705,Howard,"if you want, i can give you some of my mom’s sleeping pills."
8616,Howard,really?
7300,Howard,"yeah, raj, that’s how it works."
8209,Howard,i think it’s like beetlejuice. we said his name too many times.
8971,Howard,you can see it if you want. it’s on youtube. google astronaut screams for nine minutes.
9021,Howard,"oh, stuart, thanks. what are you doing here?"
8977,Howard,"hey, bernie."
9456,Howard,"uh, pictures of my dad and me when i was a kid."
9044,Howard,"boy, it’s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. did i tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?"
9247,Howard,no good? the guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.
7327,Howard,my mother calls me at work to see if i had a healthy bowel movement.
8302,Howard,troll master.
11208,Howard,"well, give me a second."
11843,Howard,"hey, wait up."
6865,Howard,"hey, do i mock you with the bhagavad-gita every time you scarf down a whopper?"
7230,Howard,we are fun people.
11798,Howard,she does look happy.
7225,Howard,"yeah, you know, the dark sciences."
6181,Howard,haven’t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless russian?
11793,Howard,i get it. i haven’t even made it to my office yet.
9471,Howard,"show a little compassion, a man died."
10422,Howard,and admit that we contaminated the clean room?
10393,Howard,roger abbott sounds just like roger rabbit.
10970,Howard,i know.
6311,Howard,"i’ve got one, hey leonard, your mamma’s research methodology is so flawed…."
9179,Howard,yeah.
11797,Howard,guess who’s home from the aquarium?
10706,Howard,battery charged?
9167,Howard,"okay, picture’s up. looks like the camera’s working."
7770,Howard,"hey, sheldon?"
10065,Howard,i wouldn’t worry about it. he’s got a pretty good sense of humour.
7708,Howard,"‘cause let me tell you, it’s not enough to make the legos move, they also have to capture your heart."
10584,Howard,"good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death."
6550,Howard,"it’s smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?"
7042,Howard,wrong again!
9130,Howard,raj and i are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. want to come with us?
6927,Howard,"i’ll pick you up in ten minutes. gentlemen, adieu."
11089,Howard,"okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas."
7669,Howard,then what’s with the disinfectant?
8978,Howard,"okay, i guess. it’s just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me."
10188,Howard,okay.
10020,Howard,why do you have to choose? date both of them.
6544,Howard,what’s this? 
10232,Howard,"okay, thanks for the pep talk."
9174,Howard,but what are you doing in there?
7554,Howard,have you tried rebooting him?
8400,Howard,"fine. but next time, we get a sitter."
9491,Howard,yeah. let’s go.
10228,Howard,"hey, mike. listen, nasa asked me to throw out the first pitch at an angels game. you got any advice?"
8368,Howard,i got his back.
6416,Howard,so?
9208,Howard,"wow, okay. well, thanks. i don’t know what to say."
8023,Howard,"oh, come on. that’s never gonna happen. now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick."
7211,Howard,"they’re called tattoo sleeves. look. i bought them online, raj got a set, too. fantastic, right? put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and i can still be buried in a jewish cemetery."
7080,Howard,i’m going back to the room.
11950,Howard,"okay, the eagle has landed."
9777,Howard,anyone need a beer?
10148,Howard,"he was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. and honestly, i’m kind of glad. it was getting a little weird."
9891,Howard,i can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.
7987,Howard,what? galileo did his best work while drinking wine.
7371,Howard,"oh, take all the time you need."
9841,Howard,we’ll be there.
8047,Howard,"uh, no, it’s an indictment of the american education system."
7126,Howard,to the north pole?
10440,Howard,"when i was ten, i was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. i mean, i tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. the worst part was it smelled delicious."
10745,Howard,i’m on it.
10737,Howard,good luck.
8243,Howard,"yeah, he’s gonna win the nobel prize."
9620,Howard,"huh, i guess you’re right. wonder why that is?"
11074,Howard,"it is crazy. oh. i mean, how do you prepare for something like this? i’m not even sure i’ve held a baby before."
10734,Howard,"agreed. when he gets home, i’m dropping the hammer."
6564,Howard,and some of those skinless chicks were hot. 
8959,Howard,it’s better. i wake up every morning and i just can’t believe i’m on this incredible adventure.
7724,Howard,"that’s a bazinga, right?"
7608,Howard,one ring to bring them all.
7166,Howard,"hello? i’m wearing a red turtleneck. plus, it was the only boys’ large they had."
9434,Howard,"whoa, you opened this?"
9415,Howard,"the thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. i mean, look at me. i went to this very school. those desks you’re sitting in, i was once superglued to one of them."
9860,Howard,the mineral and rock show? that would be awful even without bert.
9258,Howard,"but i have to go. we play as a group. if-if i’m not there, then everyone will blame you. they’ll be all, bernadette ruined everything. she’s the worst. so, you see? i have to play dungeons and dragons for the marriage."
9254,Howard,"no, but i’m not a stranger to dice games. i was the temple beth-el hebrew school yahtzee champion."
21717,Howard,what’s happening?
8188,Howard,"i love you, too. so what’s for dinner?"
11830,Howard,"phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us."
8882,Howard,i changed my mind. i don’t want to do this.
11768,Howard,of course. i missed you and the baby and being able to watch ellen every day.
9850,Howard,"star wars audition, take one, starring howard joel wolowitz, real-life astronaut. vader is here, now, on this moon. i felt his presence. he’s come for me. he can feel when i’m near…"
9332,Howard,it’s kind of dawning on me now.
9264,Howard,"i walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”"
7716,Howard,"yeah, sure. in fact, i’m a dungeon master."
11568,Howard,"good job, mommy. i’m proud of you."
6744,Howard,sheldon?
10013,Howard,"you know, i, i sort of went through something like this myself."
9363,Howard,"gee, i wish i could tell you no. all right, well, thanks again for helping me out."
7968,Howard,i guess that’s that. let’s go home.
11278,Howard,"in fact, that’s usually the trick to it. what time do we need to get there?"
6990,Howard,"actually, i’m thinking about this one stripper named vega. but sure, calcium sulphate could work."
7810,Howard,"on the potty? what are you, five?"
7794,Howard,i only built the arm.
11224,Howard,"no, i’m fine."
10307,Howard,there were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition scotty from a smoke-free home.
8543,Howard,"if we don’t start soon, george lucas is going to change it again."
7673,Howard,"you know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing wesley, it’d be the “wesley” crushers."
11206,Howard,"hey, look at that. it’s weird again."
10457,Howard,"so, in addition to being crazy, you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess."
10105,Howard,i’m sorry. i just can’t deal with this right now.
11708,Howard,"let’s hope he thinks so, too."
11285,Howard,i’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of raj.
10796,Howard,"you put up a good fight, lug nut, but you’ve met your match."
6642,Howard,"no, just for the fun of it, i’m gonna take his side."
11330,Howard,"oh, yeah. how do you think i stay this thin?"
6952,Howard,"you’re overlooking something. i have 11 hours with her in a confined space. unless she’s willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is howard wolowitz."
6233,Howard,the blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and lesley winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music. 
7660,Howard,would that be a giant rat’s ass?
11156,Howard,i don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.
8880,Howard,you really think so?
10727,Howard,how are you saying that with a straight face?
11045,Howard,no.
7654,Howard,"oh, that’s not a good name."
6193,Howard,done.
9394,Howard,"you’re the one? okay, let me tell you something. that guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. okay? he was devastated."
8124,Howard,sexual needs.
7312,Howard,what?
11995,Howard,kind of busy.
11381,Howard,that’s it? you’re okay with that?
11870,Howard,"grab a napkin, homie. you just got served. "
8342,Howard,"is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she’s angry?"
9989,Howard,"i’m sorry, too. it’s all my fault."
11256,Howard,i know. what are they gonna talk about?
9595,Howard,"come on, raj, it’s a yes or no question."
9345,Howard,"she’s huge. it was funny. anyway, i was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she’s doing okay."
9181,Howard,"fun story. meanwhile, you still don’t have a car."
9111,Howard,"i remember when i was five, hiding under this desk with all my halloween candy. had some peanut m&m’s, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. came home, celebrated with a snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock."
10789,Howard,what makes you say that?
10173,Howard,"so, penny, when’s the new job start?"
9782,Howard,they’re drinking beer and watching football. 
11175,Howard,ready for dinner?
10833,Howard,"oh, god, i am going to feel this tomorrow."
10960,Howard,let’s just go.
8452,Howard,she doesn’t know what james earl jones sounds like.
6924,Howard,are you jewish?
7885,Howard,"so, are you seeing anybody?"
8055,Howard,"well, actually."
11521,Howard,"stop that, this isn’t india."
11783,Howard,"i mean, why would you say that?"
7097,Howard,"yeah, see, that’s the code red. it’s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box."
10690,Howard,that right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.
9513,Howard,"no, i wasn’t. you were."
8510,Howard,really?
7070,Howard,now? right now?
11834,Howard,this is all very upsetting.
8722,Howard,"hey, guys, i got a surprise."
9392,Howard,he’s just decided he’s never leaving his apartment again.
8462,Howard,you? i made you smooth. you were an idiot.
11794,Howard,probably. we should go.
8233,Howard,"that’s pathetic. let me show you how a real magician does it. raj, take a card. don’t let me see it."
11099,Howard,maybe you’re right.
10974,Howard,i know. we’ve been waiting so long for this.
7192,Howard,"okay, i believe a chicken made you his bitch. but the cricket thing, i don’t buy. bet me."
11342,Howard,no.
7650,Howard,turns out the great sheldon cooper has stage fright.
9568,Howard,check it out. mrs. davis from human resources is here. she’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.
11184,Howard,"all right, if you say so. what’s in the box?"
10844,Howard,"if you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money."
8421,Howard,"oh. yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. hang on. ma, give up! tonight’s not your night!"
9446,Howard,ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
10133,Howard,"yeah, maybe it’s time we just release ma back into the sea."
10971,Howard,t minus 15 minutes.
10388,Howard,"makes you think. oh, well."
8300,Howard,"hey, have you told your parents you’re dating this short glass of skim milk here?"
10327,Howard,it’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings.
7360,Howard,"fine. you’re mad at me. i get it. now, how about we go spend the day together? just the two of us. we’ll go anywhere you want."
7674,Howard,"leave me alone, sheldon."
6639,Howard,"sheldon, don’t take this the wrong way, but, you’re insane."
9158,Howard,forty-three. what is forty-three? besides my mom’s neck size.
11972,Howard,"hello, amy. nice to see you. what can i say? it’s funnier with the accent."
8951,Howard,"now, can we please change the subject?"
6724,Howard,"i need you and raj to help me get the rover out of the ditch, and i need you to get stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here. she doesn’t exactly have clearance."
8048,Howard,switching it up from last year when we came as the justice league of america.
9083,Howard,"one time when i was working with him, he said that johnny depp was in the matrix. i told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. so i looked it up online and showed him. well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. and then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix."
8180,Howard,"listen, my mom’s going to palm springs to visit her sister. that’s two whole nights in a row i can sleep over with you all the way to morning. unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case i’ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier."
10411,Howard,"i know. if we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty."
8272,Howard,"hmm? oh, i’m sorry. i was somewhere else."
11861,Howard,that ain’t sheldon.
6401,Howard,recognise. 
7715,Howard,"uh, yeah."
10187,Howard,"before we do, i just talked to leonard. and if you’re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then i’m out. but if you’re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then i’m willing to give this a shot."
8717,Howard,they called the cops because of the smell. they thought we were dead.
10685,Howard,"oh. all right, playtime’s over. let’s open this baby up."
7929,Howard,"really, you, and where, where did you go?"
8042,Howard,"oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. what do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?"
6529,Howard,"becauth  becauth-th-th. brissket, brissket! water, need water. "
7419,Howard,"so two years later, there’s a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, “what the heck was all that about?”"
6422,Howard,"well, we tried. just have to face sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. a-mano. "
9152,Howard,"yeah, so?"
10766,Howard,"leonard, wait."
11770,Howard,"and the best part is halley won’t remember a thing. babies are cute, but they’re dumb. i mean, i go like this, she thinks i’m gone, then magically i’m back. i mean honestly, why are we saving for college?"
7228,Howard,really? how about that? i’ve been to the gap.
8165,Howard,nobody has a disease!
9372,Howard,"oh, that’s not bad, but as far as romance goes, i think my gift hits it right out of… "
7342,Howard,what was i supposed to do? she gave me that come-hither look.
8018,Howard,"no. something very specific that we both know you, rajesh koothrappali, are terrified of."
10527,Howard,"uh, that was my aunt. ma took a nap. she never woke up."
6439,Howard,talk about your chick magnets. 
9357,Howard,here’s some more ice.
9698,Howard,e-ni-ni-ni-ni-no.
9677,Howard,"yeah, well, i didn’t handle it so great, either."
9863,Howard,tammy cho.
11662,Howard,"oh, no, now we have two."
6333,Howard,sheldon’s sick.
10866,Howard,"look, uh, i don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing."
7967,Howard,"let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm."
9436,Howard,"if i wanted to know, i would’ve opened it years ago. the closet looks great. let’s get out of here."
9393,Howard,he’s upset because he can’t get anywhere with women.
11259,Howard,where’s claire?
6949,Howard,"come on, raj."
7632,Howard,will you be quiet?
7500,Howard,"yeah, but that’s not what you tell her."
11119,Howard,excellent.
9564,Howard,"oh, will you stop it. now, listen to me, there’s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie."
7838,Howard,"okay, i get it. we’re worried about sheldon."
11869,Howard,"no, no, look at my fingers, they’re like vienna sausages."
7125,Howard,godspeed.
11273,Howard,because no one from the future has come back to kill us.
9451,Howard,so everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?
7217,Howard,"hello, it looks like blood. did you even read the wiki how link i sent you on being goth?"
7531,Howard,hey.
8394,Howard,whoa! you just bit my tongue!
6958,Howard,"well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail."
7423,Howard,"a jewish stand-up comedian, that’d be new."
10074,Howard,sure.
7686,Howard,okay.
11949,Howard,"bernie, you okay?"
11403,Howard,"there she is. who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?"
8779,Howard,i do.
11691,Howard,hey.
6962,Howard,"do you believe him? normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. put one beer in him, and he’s m. night charmalarmalon."
9920,Howard,"hey, how come we never get that option?"
7749,Howard,"right. so, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?"
10032,Howard,"so, you and emily still together?"
6216,Howard,"so, how did it go with lesley? "
7111,Howard,"sheldon, i know what i’m doing."
9115,Howard,"okay, i have now officially moved out of my mother’s house. you are now the only woman in my life who i’ll see naked in the bathroom."
6537,Howard,fank-u. 
9220,Howard,i like rare chicken. let’s do this.
6919,Howard,"you know, most people don’t get that."
6862,Howard,"yeah, raj, what are you saying?"
8051,Howard,she and her lab team are under quarantine. seems at the christmas party they were doing jell-o shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
7315,Howard,microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
7733,Howard,"the phrase is get back on the horse, not whores."
11697,Howard,"yeah, that’s working out great for me."
8427,Howard,"yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning."
10051,Howard,you’re saying it.
7560,Howard,want my corn?
10735,Howard,"oh, i’m not taking charge, you’re the hammer."
11467,Howard,"you know, if he moves across the hall for good, leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in sheldon’s old room. solves everything."
9368,Howard,check it out. i used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.
10490,Howard,nah.
7343,Howard,i would’ve caught up to her if i hadn’t pulled a hammy.
9168,Howard,it better be. it’s the spare camera for the mars rover.
6295,Howard,worked for my parents. 
7556,Howard,what could be better? we’re in.
9490,Howard,ready to go to lunch?
10583,Howard,"i just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion."
7625,Howard,you brought a lawyer?
7520,Howard,"no, it would just freak him out. listen, before we leave, i should warn you, i’m a passionate man and i tend towards public displays of affection."
8718,Howard,48 hours of star wars gaming.
10935,Howard,"mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, god, where’s the memo with what we do now?"
9557,Howard,cheers.
7252,Howard,"no, no. look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick."
10831,Howard,"when you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?"
8301,Howard,"right, right, whereas jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons."
7655,Howard,"hey, leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?"
7135,Howard,for this i went to mit.
6314,Howard,"it’s okay, just open with a joke, you’ll be fine. "
9065,Howard,"well, i’m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, i went to space! space, space! space! space, space! space!"
10260,Howard,"oh, come on."
11952,Howard,i said i’m getting it!
8056,Howard,"okay, i guess we just go without a wonder woman."
9403,Howard,i got whine.
8824,Howard,"bernadette, listen…"
9237,Howard,really?
7313,Howard,"so, penny tells me you’re working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. that’s pretty great, what are you studying?"
11876,Howard, hi this is howard wolowitz.
8707,Howard,"but i did it. i survived. i wasn’t sure i was going to when the sandstorm hit. i just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. but somehow as i sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, i found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost."
11137,Howard,excuse us.
8176,Howard,thanks.
11421,Howard,"well, clearly, i lied."
6356,Howard,"angle your head to the right. a little more. a little more.  that’s it, now just keep true. alright, you’re close enough to sheldon’s room, deploy the sensor. now turn it on."
10176,Howard,did you send everyone to the principal’s office already?
6612,Howard,do i get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.
10501,Howard,"uh, it’s basically a summary of the theory, but there’s a bunch of positive comments on the message board."
6943,Howard,"hey, ma, you got to rent me a tux!"
7948,Howard,"oh. go away, sheldon."
7919,Howard,gagh!
7071,Howard,i say vegas baby!
8684,Howard,i wonder how long sheldon’s got.
10793,Howard,it’s burning salsa. i’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.
11375,Howard,no worries.
10459,Howard,you happy? now you can relax.
7316,Howard,and i said you could study me ’cause i’m a tiny living thing. it’s a joke.
6976,Howard,fair enough. i’ll leave you in peace.
8973,Howard,"great, i’ll do that when i want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie."
10854,Howard,"oh, honey, of course it’s your house. why else would you be cleaning it all the time?"
6489,Howard,it combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport. 
8999,Howard,"bernie, you okay?"
7022,Howard,"neediness times dress size squared. crunching the numbers, i come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius."
9407,Howard,"so, you think i’m one of the smarter kids?"
7149,Howard,great.
11442,Howard,you don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.
6878,Howard,"so, dr. hofstadter, leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister."
11248,Howard,you sure?
10893,Howard,"well, he’s smart, he’s a respected scientist."
10385,Howard,and i love how your hair is always on the soap. it’s like washing myself with a hamster.
9503,Howard,how’d you get him to come to your house?
7273,Howard,"gee, that’s, like, a 17-hour flight. how about i meet you halfway?"
11229,Howard,why do you get to pick?
9656,Howard,"i know. it was dumb, i shouldn’t have done it. and it’s making me feel sad. so sad. you know, why don’t you take a bath? i’ll do the dishes."
11745,Howard,"oh, cool. hey, i was thinking maybe we take halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work."
21703,Howard,and you just assume you’re always right?
10748,Howard,we’ll say it was beautiful in the comment section.
9565,Howard,"look, bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with amy, i’ll go with you."
9059,Howard,"to tell you the truth, i’m not really in the mood."
10998,Howard,oh. he was so excited.
6573,Howard,"get out of bed, we’re switching."
7725,Howard,"you got it. oh, raj, no. billions of dollars have gone into inventing the internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don’t have to peep through windows."
8697,Howard,"quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from i’m going"
10256,Howard,"yeah, and i’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship."
8746,Howard,so you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.
6336,Howard,"hang on, call waiting."
6780,Howard,that doesn’t count. do over! do over!
7032,Howard,i have got to learn how to draw. hey!
8603,Howard,"don’t worry, ma. i will, as soon as i can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!"
8108,Howard,"let me ask you something, bernie."
7566,Howard,"i bet if we all chipped in, we could buy sheldon a van."
7591,Howard,you are guilty.  that one i liked.
11701,Howard,"you know what, i’m not gonna go either. i’m a father now. i’d rather spend time with my family."
6712,Howard,follow mrs. wolowitz.
7424,Howard,"no, i was just… never mind."
8397,Howard,check it out. free chair.
9585,Howard,"‘cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? this was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back."
10479,Howard,i invented a game. you want to play?
10661,Howard,i suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.
9080,Howard,"this is what you sound like. i think i’m talking in an american accent, but it really sounds like i’m wearing a set of giant dentures."
11335,Howard,give me a second to call my cousin.
6959,Howard,"fine, go ahead. take a shot."
7479,Howard,don’t play innocent with me. i practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.
6373,Howard,"no, i thought of it all by myself. "
10670,Howard,"okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to skywalker ranch without us."
8080,Howard,no. it’s a little tricky. i’m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam…
7308,Howard,"so, tell me more about the future mother of my children."
7346,Howard,but i had a shot with that jogger.
8054,Howard,"relax. no one’s going to be looking at her hair. ow! i mean, ow."
10608,Howard,"you know, i thought our friendship meant more to you."
9008,Howard,"hey, ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. ma, the chain’s on the door."
8644,Howard,"all right, test my ring tone. that really is a good song."
7072,Howard,"sea world, baby!"
8929,Howard,"i can hear you without the phone,"
9830,Howard,not exactly.
8498,Howard,thank you.
10035,Howard,"oh, that’s what it says on the box. right next to dishwasher safe."
6169,Howard,bon douche.
9919,Howard,he said it.
8432,Howard,"well, i guess i’ll cut these by myself."
9599,Howard,"hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive."
9211,Howard,"yeah, so?"
6539,Howard,"oh, right, it’s your birthday, i had no idea it was your birthday, i completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it’s all over now."
7856,Howard,it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.
8690,Howard,why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?
8084,Howard,still right behind you.
11599,Howard,"okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. not other things you’re feeling, like, what have i done with my life?"
10592,Howard,excuse me. why is there a sticker on this? it’s my tardis from doctor who. i was planning on moving it in the house.
11979,Howard,why are you being so bossy?
8299,Howard,i was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.
6748,Howard,"anyway, call me. it’s howard."
10810,Howard,"oh, man, that rocks."
8391,Howard,"almost. really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor."
10229,Howard,why shouldn’t i do it?
6690,Howard,then you’re not invited to our wedding.
11671,Howard,i thought your dad paid your cards.
10874,Howard,"i don’t know why she’s lying to you. she’s the one who doesn’t want kids. in fact, every time i bring up the subject…"
7853,Howard,"great, ma!"
11946,Howard,what ya thinking so hard about?
6209,Howard,"there are pitfalls, trust me, i know. when it comes to sexual harassment law i’m… a bit of a self-taught expert. "
11083,Howard,"a million dollars? god, it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. that’s it, i got to start earning more money right now."
11487,Howard,i found him in an old box.
8461,Howard,"yeah, but i’m a make out king. "
11060,Howard,"no, i’m not okay. wild rabbits can have rabies."
7681,Howard,i wish you were aquaman. then i could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
9402,Howard,all right. thanks for ruining lobster for me.
8928,Howard,i have strongly mixed feelings.
10943,Howard,"something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’ our vibe. we’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’."
8931,Howard,how about calling her my wife?
9346,Howard,really? what do you got going on?
11729,Howard,nice. 174 diapers. that ought to get us to wednesday.
6580,Howard,well i’m glad that’s settled. 
8638,Howard,no.
8336,Howard,yeah.
7447,Howard,"you mean, bernadette?"
7557,Howard,you can come with us.
10531,Howard,"all right, fine. where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? the first, well,"
8618,Howard,let’s see the new phone.
7224,Howard,"oh, you know, goth stuff. goth magazines, goth music."
6787,Howard,"and that, charlie brown, is what boredom is all about."
8517,Howard,"oh, me? no. thanks, i’m good. i’m really just trying not to burst into flames."
6179,Howard,do i look puffy? i feel puffy.
6408,Howard,"hey, i buzzed in. "
7912,Howard,you that desperate?
11396,Howard,"okay, you’re positive you want to know?"
9252,Howard,"really? your wife makes you do stuff? you’re a big, scary cop."
8657,Howard,no. you should go.
7131,Howard,i could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills sheldon.
7418,Howard,you’re a real douche.
6705,Howard,voila!
6980,Howard,"oh, very nice. what’s leonard going to do? does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?"
7781,Howard,"not funny, leonard."
6325,Howard,"yeah, uh, break a leg."
8475,Howard,"right. are you a gold digger or not? oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? mind your own something business and go something yourself. oh, wait, i got this now."
9169,Howard,"million dollar camera, ten dollar lock."
11310,Howard,hang on.
9462,Howard,really?
10008,Howard,"look, she’s a grown woman. and, and your dad’s been gone a long time. maybe this is none of your business."
7063,Howard,"no, it was something else. why does everything have to be about sex with you? come on. who’s turn is it?"
10193,Howard,okay.
11000,Howard,no. you’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in.
8816,Howard,"actually, barry, we’re not going to have strippers tonight."
9925,Howard,okay. thank you. we’ll be in touch. you’re not gonna believe this.
8700,Howard,"it’s pretty neat. you get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up."
8704,Howard,"we did overnight survival training in the wilderness. big fun. big, big fun. i was gonna freshen up for you but i blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom."
11111,Howard,"really? you’re ahead of bale? the man who personified the words, i’m batman."
11780,Howard,what are you making?
7507,Howard,which is why i tend to feel threatened by other guys.
6161,Howard,wait till you see this.
6702,Howard,"of course not, i got a buddy of mine at norad to have a spy drone fly over."
8318,Howard,they’re running tests. i don’t know. it may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.
10194,Howard,making a straw.
9948,Howard,really?
10978,Howard,what kind of doctor is she?
7402,Howard,"so, when do the meteors get here?"
8720,Howard,"look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. you’re a grown man. act like one. tell amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. maybe she’ll dig it. women like a firm hand on the tiller."
9716,Howard,how is that possible?
6399,Howard,"gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. fishman, chen, chowdry, mcnair aren’t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year. "
8469,Howard,"he’s not going to listen, he’s in love."
8850,Howard,"hey, i was thinking. for our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from dirty dancing?"
11198,Howard,you need some help?
10694,Howard,"relax, it’ll be fine."
8758,Howard,not on your life.
11445,Howard,"see? easy. and look at all this cargo space. now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. i’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh."
8014,Howard,"first of all, if we had superpowers, i wouldn’t be the sidekick. you’d be the sidekick."
11130,Howard,"you can do it, sheldon."
6895,Howard,no go. the dumpsters are deep in astronomy department territory.
10849,Howard,"i love you, amy. "
7821,Howard,"oh, he’s an ass when he doesn’t. you just don’t hear it."
8730,Howard,"hey, raj, you didn’t send your rsvp in. i’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding."
10246,Howard,"yep, i wish stuart would reopen. i hate this place, too."
8125,Howard,"so, while i’m gone, you’re going to have to satisfy her."
8727,Howard,i’ll miss you.
10029,Howard,she is. but i like that attitude.
8820,Howard,"oh, please shut up."
6901,Howard,"well, we’re surrounded, so i guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed."
7026,Howard,"let it go, sheldon."
6214,Howard,"have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?"
9834,Howard,"eh, tomato, tomahto. the important thing is she’s dead."
9452,Howard,how could you do this?
11593,Howard,"you if it’s at mit, i can make some calls. maybe we can get sheldon a prototype."
6504,Howard,just do it. 
9054,Howard,clever.
10560,Howard,what happened to snooping is wrong?
10817,Howard,"oh, please. your brain belongs to whoever’s willing to sleep with you."
10043,Howard,"uh, no. i, i don’t, i don’t think so."
11862,Howard,it’s unbelievable. sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me.
11736,Howard,"anyway, sheldon, we’re at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter."
7210,Howard,"no, no. i’m going out like this. "
6847,Howard,i can fix it.
8296,Howard,he drank from leonard’s glass.
8264,Howard,"yeah, we’re kind of bad-asses, aren’t we?"
9869,Howard,let’s go.
9107,Howard,"all right, i’ve had enough of this. i’m a grown man, i have a successful career, for the love of god, i’ve been to space. i will move out when i’m ready, and i don’t need anyone badgering me into it."
11587,Howard,"so, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. watch. it’s easy,"
8856,Howard,a week from friday.
11386,Howard,"yeah, i was just thinking the same thing."
6875,Howard,"penny, come on, we were just finding our sound."
6367,Howard,a small payload support structure for a european science experimental package that’s going up on the next space shuttle. 
10590,Howard,it’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. took that long to walk it off.
11158,Howard,you want to come with us?
7760,Howard,and now the kung pao chicken.
10858,Howard,i’m listening.
10607,Howard,she’s my champion.
11161,Howard,wait. i bet it’s suicide squad. let’s check it out.
10507,Howard,"yeah. dr. dmitri plancovik of moscow university said dis paper great, i love it more than wodka."
7483,Howard,"oh, that explains a lot."
10945,Howard,"so, who is this guy?"
9481,Howard,why can’t you just watch porn like a regular guy? i need your laptop so i can configure the software.
10876,Howard,that would be nice.
11916,Howard,"leslie winkle. you’ve reached friends with benefits. for a booty call, press one now."
6554,Howard,"what, so you’re saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you’ll just walk away?"
7924,Howard,yes.
9755,Howard,hey.
7029,Howard,rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock?
9638,Howard,cherry
9035,Howard,it’s my official nasa portrait.
7176,Howard,what are you doing here?
9385,Howard,"i’m telling you, something’s wrong. i can always feel it when raj is in trouble."
6675,Howard,yeah.
6240,Howard,"as in, costumes? "
7115,Howard,"i got your back, sister. all right, i think we’ve got a prototype ready to test. hand me that tupperware."
7099,Howard,"i’m gonna figure out how to fix it, then i’ll tell them."
11103,Howard,i’m sorry i freaked out this morning. i want you to know i’m done being scared.
9207,Howard,thank you.
10903,Howard,you thought she was great in x-men.
7816,Howard,"okay. toilet’s sounding pretty good now, huh?"
7427,Howard,"okay, just to be clear, there’s only one correct answer, right? it’s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?"
6354,Howard,"you don’t stay go straight when you’re giving bearings, you say keep true. "
9162,Howard,"that’s forty-two, dumb-ass."
7314,Howard,"oh, cool. so you could study me."
11828,Howard,"that’s enough, put her away."
6370,Howard,"sheldon, there’s a diploma in my office that says i have a masters in engineering."
6380,Howard,"yeah, so, when i was fifteen i met denise polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8. "
7372,Howard,"yeah, i don’t think i need my preshow urination anymore."
11362,Howard,"hey, hey, hey, you’re not going anywhere."
8465,Howard,why are you still doing this?
9064,Howard,"you’re right, the party’s fantastic. please, tell me more. i haven’t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old."
6460,Howard,"well, i think you’re delightfully droll. or as the french say, tres drole. "
6327,Howard,i’m game.
6313,Howard,"i just checked the house, there’s probably twenty, twenty-five people in there."
11085,Howard,"you’re right, it is, i’m just a little overwhelmed right now."
10114,Howard,maybe you’re right. anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.
6622,Howard,"wait a minute, i called dibs on fishbine’s office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe."
7476,Howard,"thanks, honey.  all right, what is your deal?"
6606,Howard,i’ll take the bullet.
10241,Howard,what? you’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.
11425,Howard,you jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!
11444,Howard,yes.
10627,Howard,"you know what, i’m being a bad host. let me get some more coffee."
8008,Howard,did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?
9709,Howard,"if i didn’t have you life would be dreary, i’d be string theory without any string. i’d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. i’d be firefly, buffy and avengers without joss whedon. i’d speak a lot more klingon, heghlu’meh qaq jajvam. "
7061,Howard,is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
7370,Howard,bye.
10257,Howard,he’s right.
11555,Howard,"hey, he got her to stop."
8321,Howard,it’s not important.
10271,Howard,with comfy seats.
6722,Howard,"yeah, i picked her up in the bar. she’s a doctor. one free barium enema and my mother won’t care she’s not jewish."
11474,Howard,"hey! i saw your car… oh, sorry. am i interrupting?"
8661,Howard,everyone in the world of science knows who richard feynman was.
7900,Howard,how’d he know about it?
8817,Howard,she was my second cousin.
8625,Howard,"yeah, what are we eating?"
6668,Howard,i believe one day sheldon will eat an enormous amount of thai food and split into two sheldons.
7976,Howard,"don’t be oversensitive. he’s calling you illiterate, not your race."
8441,Howard,she says it’s nice to meet you.
10312,Howard,"oh, you’re saying i don’t do anything around here. look at my chore chart."
6522,Howard,"no, see, the only way i could get him to leave is to tell him i ate a peanut. because i’m allergic to peanuts. "
11009,Howard,"you know, amy took some time off from him. really improved their relationship."
6234,Howard,i put it there. 
8308,Howard,"no, i mean lunch, today, with bernadette."
9263,Howard,"excuse me, i’m a married man now. i wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile."
9745,Howard,and the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.
6794,Howard,"i’m sorry. uh, this one. let’s go!"
11893,Howard,make sure they remember no peanuts.
11953,Howard,"emily, this is our friend raj."
10499,Howard,"well, um, we were just kidding around."
9977,Howard,buzz aldrin.
11519,Howard,i love you.
9222,Howard,"so, mrs. rostenkowski, you took that trip to the grand canyon. how was it?"
11098,Howard,"if this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems."
9056,Howard,"okay, here it is. bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. is that true?"
7233,Howard,not particularly.
10421,Howard,"okay, well, what’s your plan?"
9344,Howard,my mom’s been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.
9775,Howard,"oh, i love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. get it? ‘cause it sounds like blintz."
9295,Howard,"oh, so is mine."
11635,Howard,great. we found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.
11366,Howard,i am having coffee.
10036,Howard,i promise i’ll be on my best behaviour.
11674,Howard,you actually think penny will have fun at comic-con?
11185,Howard,oh. that’s cool. can we try it?
10227,Howard,heads up! watch out!
11750,Howard,hey.
7878,Howard,"i wasn’t athletic, yeah, i was kind of sickly."
7564,Howard,not really. i was in my boogie zone.
9073,Howard,i don’t know. raj sent me some video of buzz aldrin.
10846,Howard,"hey, i want to try."
7806,Howard,he’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even have to put out to get free stuff.
10046,Howard,wow. now who doesn’t listen?
7387,Howard,"there’s no one there. you’re hearing things, you crazy old lady!"
8715,Howard,you’re about to walk up three flights of stairs.
7872,Howard,would you talk to her?
8997,Howard,gesundheit. you okay?
7793,Howard,it’s a robot arm.
8340,Howard,"well, based on the available evid…"
10471,Howard,"here we go, my first hindu temple."
11606,Howard,schmuck. got it.
6731,Howard,"ok, i guess we have to turn to plan b."
11805,Howard,"now, this is rare. i don’t know which one of you i want to stop talking first."
6419,Howard,sometimes you’ve got to take one for the team.
11423,Howard,"those jets are for my secret spot, not his."
8527,Howard,"well, i, i’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?"
8225,Howard,"i’m saying believe in magic, you muggle."
11753,Howard,"well, i know she’s mad at me about something."
6808,Howard,"wait a minute. this isn’t flirting, you’re serious."
8530,Howard,"what would you like to talk about, sheldon? why do you hate us?"
9598,Howard,"yeah, they kind of do."
8169,Howard,big fight with my mother.
11666,Howard,"what, what are you doing? i, i, i schlepped the baby over, i brought imported beer. why don’t you like me?"
8787,Howard,that’s nice.
11480,Howard,ah.
7698,Howard,are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
7028,Howard,"oh, come on! i need this for my batman collection."
11448,Howard,"you’re gonna feel terrible when i’m in a wheelchair. which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan."
10180,Howard,yes.
10812,Howard,who cares? i thought the whole point of footprints on the moon was to write songs that make people think.
11738,Howard,you can just feel the time being saved.
7076,Howard,"okay, fine, i’m checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she’s saying she dumped me, people need to know i dumped her."
11392,Howard,"but you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. ta-da."
9034,Howard,"oh, hey, stuart, i got you a little souvenir from my trip to space."
10733,Howard,"yeah, right. sick. he didn’t have jaundice. he just looks like that."
10847,Howard,"hang on, i’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. the man who will father your children. okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?"
6667,Howard,"not sheldon. over the years, we’ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. i’m an advocate of mytosis."
9654,Howard,i’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?
6729,Howard,anything?
10957,Howard,i can’t watch.
11419,Howard,"nah, that’s not gonna hurt his feelings."
7290,Howard,"oh, you guys had me scared for a minute."
11476,Howard,"oh, yeah, the astronomer. raj told us about you. hey, free toilet paper."
9713,Howard,you’re going to girls’ night.
11253,Howard,oh. cool.
8333,Howard,can i see her?
11504,Howard,and i think you’re cute.
9330,Howard,"koothrappali and i bought a used 3-d printer for $5,000."
10106,Howard,"bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?"
11087,Howard,"if i’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, i need to come up with a big idea to make some money."
7641,Howard,we stand up.
10472,Howard,huh. i always thought it was mini golf.
6252,Howard,"no, seriously, you can, i have transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
6914,Howard,"okay, one way to look at this is that i’m getting new equipment, and you’re not, and that’s unfair. but a better way to look at this is that i’m getting sex and you’re not, and that’s delightful."
8679,Howard,okay.
11615,Howard,"okay, i’ll tell you what. i’ll make you a deal. 30 years from now, if you’re still single and things don’t work out with me and bernadette, you and i can give it a go."
9511,Howard,"of course we can. especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little cinna… son of a bitch, she’s gone."
9931,Howard,"no, not that. although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs."
8994,Howard,"whoa, thank you. great to be back on earth."
7704,Howard,what the hell are you doing?
6382,Howard,we need a hot fifteen year-old asian girl with a thing for smart guys. 
9476,Howard,"yeah, you wouldn’t want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. oh, yeah, that’s what i was hoping for, meerkats."
10562,Howard,"well, it’s hard. a lot of ma’s stuff brings back fond memories."
8799,Howard,"fine, i’ll just make him do a couple more things, then i’ll stop."
8908,Howard,i told you we are not recreating the wedding from the sound of music.
11387,Howard,mm.
6561,Howard,"good, ‘cos they don’t work. "
11721,Howard,what are you doing here?
6230,Howard,what’s the matter?
7160,Howard,thanks. i call it the clooney.
6818,Howard,i don’t want to talk to her.
11148,Howard,"article three, as it pertains to this project, dr. sheldon cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward howard wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the ghost rider movie was, quote, not that bad."
9309,Howard,what?
10877,Howard,but you were okay throwing me under the bus?
11892,Howard,what are you so happy about?
10136,Howard,i don’t know what else we can do.
11725,Howard,"unless it was singing be our guest, i doubt it."
11008,Howard,he was being a jerk to everyone. don’t take it personally.
9839,Howard,what’s your part?
11552,Howard,so what did you and leonard do?
11580,Howard,no.
9903,Howard,i don’t own a pocket watch.
6508,Howard,how’s it going?
11627,Howard,those are just the things i say out loud.
6819,Howard,ma!
6817,Howard,who?
10774,Howard,i bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.
11921,Howard,"yes, she’s pushy and yes, he’s whipped, but that’s not the expression. come on, i want to stop at walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner."
9102,Howard,"no excuse. it’s just, you know, i’m jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the sabbath. so this one’s on god."
10839,Howard,what’s up?
9300,Howard,"okay, i just talked to my mom. she arranged for us to get a rental car."
11322,Howard,"calm down, try not to think about it."
11336,Howard,"first of all, he’s in boca raton, which is better than fort lauderdale. but more importantly, he lasted two days on jeopardy, so he’s clearly a smart guy."
6816,Howard,you make me want to kill myself.
10941,Howard,what should we write?
7648,Howard,"uh, hang on, flaming arrow."
10669,Howard,you know what? you’re right. i should have asked you.
8801,Howard,"gears and springs from his wheelchair. pretty cool, huh?"
9845,Howard,that stinks.
11660,Howard,"come on, raj, it’s like your favourite movie, you’re just waiting to exhale. yeah, i knew you could do it."
7355,Howard,stipulated.
11136,Howard,can i talk to you in the hall?
7090,Howard,is that supposed to be funny?
7788,Howard,"that’s great, mom, thanks!"
7100,Howard,"hey, you said you were gonna be supportive."
11755,Howard,"hmm, let’s see. mm. okay, here we go, six years ago, i got a call that bernie’s great-aunt, trixie, died. "
7018,Howard,"come on, the whole idea behind anything can happen thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately."
11762,Howard,"sure, sorry. "
7954,Howard,maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. that’s how i learned.
9085,Howard,"i can’t sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry."
7020,Howard,really? are you familiar with the drake equation?
9200,Howard,it’s not just a parking spot. he can’t handle the fact that i’m a bigger deal than he is now.
8281,Howard,you will?
8297,Howard,where are you going?
8783,Howard,"but in exchange, i’d like you to do a few things for me."
9020,Howard,"it’s okay, you know, we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame. we leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your howie mandels."
6676,Howard,"well, as it turns out, it’s also a klingon word."
7587,Howard,but there must be thousands of dollars here. why don’t you put it in the bank?
6636,Howard,"okay, dead cat named lucky, continue."
9437,Howard,do whatever you want.
10191,Howard,that’s where i’m a little fuzzy.
6846,Howard,have you thought about putting him in a crate while you’re out of the apartment?
9373,Howard,"yes, please."
11169,Howard,i know. i want to make him feel bad.
10099,Howard,the doctor says you need to get exercise.
9680,Howard,"well, we’re real close to finishing off the new batman game."
6427,Howard,it looks like something they found on the ship at roswell. 
10458,Howard,the man who crashed his stationary bike.
8969,Howard,the other astronauts are being mean to me.
11091,Howard,"maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people."
6857,Howard,wow. i don’t see how we missed that.
8570,Howard,"little snarky there, cello lessons. and we have this completely ordinary cylinder. if you’d like to examine it?"
7877,Howard,"you know, i’ve always blamed myself for him leaving. i always thought it was because i wasn’t the son he wanted."
10713,Howard,i don’t know. must be getting a wifi signal from somewhere else.
10966,Howard,"well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.  "
7691,Howard,"bye. actually, i’m this way. do i smell hot dogs?"
6600,Howard,that’s what makes it get all funky.
6191,Howard,"hold on, honey, men at work. the pvc comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here."
6900,Howard,sorry.
6585,Howard,"i don’t care what the bosoms say, sheldon, i just want to be part of the conversation."
7203,Howard,"yeah, fine, whatever. the point is, you’re wrong again."
10845,Howard,what was wrong with that guy?
11577,Howard,that sounds expensive.
10778,Howard,"oh, not a problem. if anything goes down, we just put koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head."
7209,Howard,no. raj and i are going a goth club in hollywood to hang with the night people. anybody want to come along?
6942,Howard,"so, bottom line, i’m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy."
9946,Howard,"come on, how is that not a joke? you got to get me out of this. shoot me in the foot."
6470,Howard,"yeah, well my people invented circumcision. you’re welcome!"
11112,Howard,can we just all agree we’re worried about affleck?
7134,Howard,"oh, damn it. peer pressure. fine."
7580,Howard,"ooh, that’s gotta sting."
6936,Howard,what about it?
8589,Howard,just give me the pitcher. behold! wrong pitcher.
7627,Howard,then let go!
11681,Howard,what you doing?
7573,Howard,that’s the one.
7066,Howard,"i don’t know. she just said howard, momma’s a rolling stone. and then her call waiting beeped and she was gone."
10889,Howard,i think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating web site out there.
11228,Howard,as long as i don’t have to watch with him.
11947,Howard,"oh, great. it’s my cousin david about the ring. hey, david, what’d you find? oh, sure, a half a carat’s fine. her freakishly small hands make anything look big. it’s one of the reasons i love her."
10641,Howard,hey.
10575,Howard,"no. if i find my foreskin, i’m gonna kill myself."
9147,Howard,"yes, i’m sure. now, you stand guard, i’m going to…"
9740,Howard,"wow, this is so cool. thanks."
11605,Howard,like this one?
7927,Howard,"yeah, i just wanna put it out there in case i inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. happy? . "
8952,Howard,"hey, i’m a grown man. i’m gonna live with my wife. my mother’s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own."
10134,Howard,"well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months."
10883,Howard,"speaking of making babies, what do you say i wash up and poke around your crawlspace?"
9504,Howard,"you know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?"
11712,Howard,"well, there’s a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems."
11230,Howard,don’t tell me where to go.
6251,Howard,"if that’s a working stethoscope, maybe you’d like to hear my heart skip a beat."
9150,Howard,"pretty good. i managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. there. ready?"
8615,Howard,why not?
7990,Howard,"yes, but she’s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire."
10122,Howard,thanks a lot. now i have to go rub her belly again.
10018,Howard,and the healing begins.
11623,Howard,"hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?"
9588,Howard,you’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.
6556,Howard,"boy, that story gets better every time you hear it. "
7989,Howard,"oh, i, i’m sorry, galileo drank diet sprite. look, you’re my best friend, she’s my girlfriend, you should bond. you know, like you and my mom did."
10795,Howard,great. couple of pinches ought to do the trick.
11909,Howard,"good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?"
8367,Howard,"yeah, how could you do that?"
6749,Howard,son of a bitch.
11775,Howard,she already likes soap bubbles more than us.
10532,Howard,i really did mean first.
8676,Howard,you really want me to sign a pre-nup?
11785,Howard,have a great first day back.
10301,Howard,"oh, of course. what did you guys want to talk about?"
11806,Howard,"boy, it is neck and neck right now."
9524,Howard,i’m really sorry.
8922,Howard,she doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so i’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van.
7812,Howard,"oh, and potty is okay?"
7862,Howard,would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?
11226,Howard,"oh, please. what could you possibly have that i would be jealous of?"
6451,Howard,"okay man, be cool, we’re all friends here. "
6324,Howard,"no, it’s okay, it’s your millenium falcon, you and chewbacca do whatever you want to do. me and princess leia here will find some other way to spend the evening. "
6593,Howard,i’d hit that.
10697,Howard,one toy at a time.
10236,Howard,thank you. thank you.
6284,Howard,it’s the entire premise of fiddler on the roof.
8419,Howard,"relax, it’ll be fine."
7345,Howard,"oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?"
9627,Howard,"hey, you know what this could mean ."
9912,Howard,i am.
7261,Howard,"yeah, i really wish i could, penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil."
11918,Howard,"red alert, leonard. sheldon ran away."
6591,Howard,"it wasn’t your fault, raj, he was dressed as a green orion slave girl."
6392,Howard,he’s back.
7276,Howard,am i interrupting?
8777,Howard,that’s an interesting idea. why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?
11100,Howard,"thank you, sheldon."
7870,Howard,"well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?"
10549,Howard,"okay, calm down. there’s probably something jammed behind it. just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there."
10297,Howard,hey.
10329,Howard,"yeah, that was very uncool. get the hammer. get the hammer."
10977,Howard,hi.
7680,Howard,"nah, i can’t. i got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. looks like the manatee tank at sea world."
10658,Howard,"hang on. not that your song isn’t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?"
9758,Howard,"please? bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and i never have anything to say to that guy."
11645,Howard,maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.
11522,Howard,sorry. i know you were just trying to help. i love you.
8737,Howard,well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.
11202,Howard,is it baby hormones or actually sad?
7955,Howard,"penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us friday to see it on the big screen at the colonial."
10680,Howard,now i rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.
8789,Howard,"here is a black light to check them. and for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room."
8556,Howard,wait a minute. are you telling me that sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn’t enough to hold on to a woman?
7840,Howard,"so, my dear, we meet again."
11204,Howard,"no, raj, you’ve been great. i just, i need to start doing my part around here."
8583,Howard,"oh-ho-ho! i haven’t seen this trick in years. it’s called the dove pan. you let everyone see the pan is empty, but there’s a secret compartment in the lid. and then you open it and produce a live… don’t look in there."
11479,Howard,"damn, the macarthur genius grant."
7563,Howard,"thanks. you, too."
8806,Howard,give me a compliment.
6467,Howard,hallelujah. 
11647,Howard,you really figured it out?
7979,Howard,yeah. this man is not my father. i’m being held hostage. so i’m going to do something insane in the hopes that you’ll call 911.
7184,Howard,"uh, no, no, no, don’t tell him, let’s see if he can figure it out."
7826,Howard,"and someday, when you have varicose veins, i’ll show you how to massage them."
6830,Howard,i guess.
8153,Howard,"well, i’d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning."
6852,Howard,guilty as charged. i’m out.
9018,Howard,"yeah, well, bernadette’s a little under the weather and my mom’s kind of under my dentist."
9824,Howard,"fine, then go talk to her on your own."
9428,Howard,"are you kidding? he’s like a savant at organizing. everything in his apartment has a label on it. including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. and if you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a label that says label."
11832,Howard,but the movie did just get good.
7969,Howard,i guess we’d better go after him.
11377,Howard,no.
10791,Howard,we have plenty of food for the animals.
9690,Howard,"look, she’s gonna be back any second, so here’s the deal. i’m writing a song, and i was hoping we could all play it for her together."
9980,Howard,"well, it still doesn’t."
8531,Howard,that’s fun to have in a lunchroom.
9741,Howard,wow.
8224,Howard,fine. get another deck and i’ll do the trick with that.
11680,Howard,"mm-mm, how’s my favourite girl?"
8865,Howard,i’m not sure.
7426,Howard,you’re kidding.
8208,Howard,yeah.
6334,Howard,"for god’s sake, ma, i’m twenty six years old."
11874,Howard,"bonjour mademoiselle, i understand you’re new in town. "
8797,Howard,he’s mean to me all the time. you’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.
7148,Howard,"dammit, i should have gone over and told her we were back."
8844,Howard,why?
8736,Howard,yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.
8829,Howard,"no, but what is it?"
8195,Howard,"better put it on the list. if you wash my underwear with regular soap, i get little red bumps on my tuchus."
8102,Howard,yep. loser.
7937,Howard,"thanks. listen, i have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the fbi."
8118,Howard,"yeah, leonard and i are fine, but i think raj needs to meet a girl really soon."
8538,Howard,what do you want us to do about it?
7932,Howard,mmm.
9026,Howard,"no, no, you guys go. have fun."
8582,Howard,"well, that’s because you haven’t been around them much. this is good practice. i mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?"
9218,Howard,good. fine is good. how you liking retirement?
6637,Howard,"so, not a puppy?"
7889,Howard,isn’t there somewhere else you can be?
8092,Howard,yes. bernie sure is.
9339,Howard,it’s my suitcase. i lent it to you two years ago.
6250,Howard,"you know, psychology journals, internet research, and there’s this great show on vh1 about how to pick up girls. "
9086,Howard,you ever hear back from hawking?
11809,Howard,"hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. have you ever tried to juggle?"
8100,Howard,"i’m just thinking. if you had sex with that guy, i mean, there’s nothing i can do here that will make any kind of impact."
6207,Howard,"i disagree, love is not a sprint, it’s a marathon. a relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. or hits you with the pepper spray. "
7285,Howard,"by the way, i couldn’t help overhearing your big finish. bravo, leonard."
7318,Howard,role-playing games?
6293,Howard,i’d like to try a slippery nipple. 
10082,Howard,"raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes the sound of music.  hey, penny. what’s up? no, bernie’s working late. really? thanks for telling me."
7078,Howard,"alright, where are these amazing shrimp?"
6217,Howard,"well, as usual, wolowitz has the solution. i happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and leonard could have his pick."
11486,Howard,"say hello to everybody’s little friend, remote control stephen hawking."
11838,Howard,give us some good news.
6175,Howard,"yeah, i’ve had him since level ten. his name is buttons. anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest."
8348,Howard,"please, this isn’t about me. i’m proud of you."
8872,Howard,"i’m sorry, i didn’t know, is this going to… well, i should sit… may i be seat… well, i’ll just sit."
10097,Howard,"well, you didn’t miss anything. we just started over."
8273,Howard,it’s a bernadette thing.
7986,Howard,"i did it with you when we rented the notebook.  yes, gena rowlands is a treasure. you’d better open up that bottle of wine or i’m gonna end up with swimmer’s ear."
8416,Howard,"so, dinner went nice."
7535,Howard,"all right, i was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but i can come back later when you don’t have a high-powered weapon."
8261,Howard,that’s the nicest thing he does to your sister.
8526,Howard,what’s up?
11676,Howard,why don’t you just tell her not to come?
8120,Howard,"raj, i have amazing news!"
10538,Howard,the day she left for florida. she asked me to drive her to the airport. i was too busy. and i made her take a cab. i was too busy.
8812,Howard,"kangaroo, uh, i’d be a kanga-jew. the first of my people to dunk a basketball."
11326,Howard,at least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.
8359,Howard,why?
10324,Howard,"oh, i think i just cheated on my wife."
8822,Howard,"yeah, it was great. and low-key, like i promised. no hanky-panky, no strippers. just the guys telling jokes."
9194,Howard,"okay, you need to move now."
9057,Howard,"you know what, guys? never mind. i just won’t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again."
10696,Howard,"okay, i think i’ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip."
11934,Howard,really? that’s your question? when did he put a ramp in?
6518,Howard,"no, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket. "
8189,Howard,that’s fine. why don’t we go fool around in our bedroom? and then you can go shopping.
9279,Howard,do you really think you should be drinking right now?
7833,Howard,"oh, i thought you were just making a generalization, you know, i’m worried about sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime jell-o."
11955,Howard,"oh, hey, hi. nice to see you."
6869,Howard,"leonard, wait. take a jacket, it’s spritzing a little."
6540,Howard,maybe.
11066,Howard,he’s not showing any symptoms. i guess i’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
6449,Howard,well you can’t just call dibs.
7547,Howard,"now, inside, we’ve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software."
6891,Howard,that was close.
7480,Howard,"not so far, but that’s not the point!"
7720,Howard,i was waiting for the right time. this is the right time.
10464,Howard,i’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.
10284,Howard,"mm, that was mine."
9735,Howard,since when can’t you open up with me?
6713,Howard,"noticed the eye patch, did you? it’s all part of a technique i’ve been studying for picking up women. you employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable."
10973,Howard,he’s right.
6884,Howard,"next time, don’t yousa bring mama to work. okee-day?"
9785,Howard,don’t worry about it.
7899,Howard,the greasy old fat guy in facilities management?
7056,Howard,you’re weighing me down. i’m a falcon who hunts better solo.
11679,Howard,so?
9628,Howard,that’s it. 
11826,Howard,"tammy jo st. cloud. oh, and i’m a dork for juggling."
7586,Howard,"sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?"
8770,Howard,i showed him some card tricks.
9103,Howard,"my religion’s kinda loosey-goosey. basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross, you’re good."
11371,Howard,maybe we should break for lunch. what time is it?
11981,Howard,"okay, ma. say hi to aunt gladys. yeah, i love you, too. bye."
9137,Howard,this is where he goes? what’s in there?
10760,Howard,"and you let penny marry him. compared to that, who cares if i bought a george clooney limited edition manscaping kit?"
9131,Howard,"well, where are you going?"
6998,Howard,that’s your entire profit margin.
10987,Howard,what’s up?
7186,Howard,sounds like a cricket.
8320,Howard,"well, maybe. mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her."
10693,Howard,hey.
11990,Howard,wanna see a movie?
9965,Howard,"uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other."
10811,Howard,yeah?
9142,Howard,why would he chain up stephen hawking?
11038,Howard,"okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind i’m dumping emily."
9039,Howard,not really.
8031,Howard,"that’s for a footrace. if you want to race, we have to go outside."
6745,Howard,lisa?
6221,Howard,"excuse me for being so bold, but i now see where sheldon gets his smouldering good looks."
11037,Howard,"me, too. and i think you’re even more beautiful than this rose."
10816,Howard,the past was lunch. you know what’s really happening here? your girlfriend is breaking up our band.
6988,Howard,"uh, i’ve seen this before."
11151,Howard,"that’s very generous, sheldon."
7638,Howard,we’re getting to him.
11205,Howard,"well, not right now. but we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat."
11557,Howard,"oh, good."
9129,Howard,"two forty-four, right on schedule. hey, sheldon."
11050,Howard,"uh, you turn off the jets, i’ll get a strainer from the kitchen."
8595,Howard,i’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. i always thought i’d be a dad someday.
7825,Howard,i do this for my mom all the time. see? with the grain.
6184,Howard,"yeah, and you don’t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night."
7389,Howard,anything yet?
9607,Howard,thank you.
7226,Howard,oy vay.
8975,Howard,"hey, bernie, guess what? i stood up to the other astronauts like you said and i got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week i got a good night’s sleep. "
6896,Howard,why don’t i run away and you cover me?
10983,Howard,that was incredible.
10264,Howard,"i get that. i, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. it was one of the few things we did together."
6663,Howard,"you know, the pishkin-wolowitz liquid waste disposal system is turning a few heads as well."
7391,Howard,"ooh, real sex."
6263,Howard,"in the shower. oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won’t."
6652,Howard,i haven’t configured it yet. let’s see… bradley tank… transport truck…  batmobile…
11579,Howard,no.
7941,Howard,"i see. well, it’s good to know, when i need you guys, i can always count on you to step up and ruin everything."
10543,Howard,"oh, bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited.  hey, what’s up?"
10771,Howard,i told you to put tape on his mouth.
11614,Howard,"yeah, the field was just here. the field said no."
11883,Howard,"no, i’m lost too, i think she skipped a step. "
9779,Howard,here you go.
10636,Howard,that’s not what she meant.
11873,Howard,"i think mrs tishman’s got her eye on you. i’ve been there, you’re in for a treat. "
9601,Howard,you think?
8422,Howard,"come on, take a break! bernadette needs to brush her teeth!"
11711,Howard,"it is our pleasure.  hey, can you hold on one sec? hello?"
9560,Howard,"buddy, you okay? oh, man."
9862,Howard,"marci grossman, lisa mazzarino."
9148,Howard,just keep an eye out. i’ll have this open in a minute.
8776,Howard,"let me try gansta, hells no."
6227,Howard,i’ll take the heart smart platter.
9030,Howard,i don’t think so.
10334,Howard,like you and your dog.
8560,Howard,i thought you didn’t like facebook anymore.
11939,Howard,"i don’t care if eat, pray, love changed your life, i’m not reading it."
6568,Howard,bye  
11269,Howard,same reason i don’t talk about ass cancer. it’s not a pleasant topic.
10079,Howard,what difference does it make?
7771,Howard,"no, not peace. hang on."
9440,Howard,no.
8353,Howard,yes!
8794,Howard,what’s the matter?
10245,Howard,"my mom got him cable. in my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. do you know how many hbos that leech had my mother get him? seven. seven hbos. seven."
9719,Howard,"hello, everyone."
9904,Howard,"fun fact, i’m gonna jump off this train."
8135,Howard,"excuse me, my girlfriend doesn’t pick out my clothes. my mother does."
10038,Howard,you took ballet?
10203,Howard,"okay, this one is for a cadbury creme egg."
7550,Howard,"don’t worry, the net’s going to be electrified. picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably."
8494,Howard,well why not?
11986,Howard,"baby, i need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’. baby, i need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’."
8063,Howard,i always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.
11012,Howard,no.
7094,Howard,"guys, we have a code red."
11933,Howard,"you’re right, penny jogs. maybe you guys can run together."
21706,Howard,"so, i get the draft?"
6799,Howard,"all right, enough chitchat, let’s destroy something."
8942,Howard,who is it?
7501,Howard,"i don’t know, something that doesn’t make me come off as a petty, jealous douche."
10081,Howard,"let me get this straight. so, he kills this girl’s father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her."
10985,Howard,"what is it, stuart?"
10212,Howard,cut it out. you’re hurting my feelings.
9498,Howard,"however long you think the foreplay should be, triple it."
9249,Howard,"wait, now we’re shooting things?"
6871,Howard,"well, there you go. problem solved."
10955,Howard,no. let him spot us.
8338,Howard,yeah. do you?
7311,Howard,six if you count klingon.
6948,Howard,"yeah, cool. seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much."
9283,Howard,"relax. everything’s gonna be fine. before i met bernadette i was in here every other day. uh, little tip, turn off your i like big butts ringtone before you go in."
6721,Howard,"yeah, baby, i’ll be right in."
11129,Howard,"okay, great."
9910,Howard,she’s right. 
11237,Howard,i don’t know. i like the pain of others.
8472,Howard,"hey, bernadette doesn’t mind where i get my motor running, as long as i park in the right garage."
10267,Howard,"well, i don’t need a reason, it’s my house."
8854,Howard,"uh-huh, wonderful. yay."
10618,Howard,"yeah, i bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass."
7854,Howard,"and with that mental picture, i think we’re done for the evening."
11399,Howard,as soon as i get home. we’re hoping to make it before dark.
8810,Howard,"sorry, i can’t."
10323,Howard,"oh, come on. it’s a replica."
9336,Howard,tell me about it.
9642,Howard,"leonard, you ready for lunch?"
11535,Howard,melvina.
10199,Howard,"i’m smart enough, sheldon. asking me a bunch of questions about a topic i’m not familiar with doesn’t prove anything. i could do the same to you."
7168,Howard,"no, i want to blend in."
10204,Howard,"which archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?"
8648,Howard,mass. that’s a cool nickname. ‘cause force equals mass times acceleration.
8068,Howard,"hey, i…"
7295,Howard,not ka. ka-ah.
7477,Howard,inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
9573,Howard,"oh, please, you did not have a moment."
7180,Howard,"okay, when you say “it wasn’t great, do you mean for both of you? because we can totally see it not being great for her. am i right?"
10406,Howard,i love that.
8663,Howard,check it out. look at the size of that rice krispie treat. same price.
10222,Howard,are you kidding me?!
6647,Howard,"yeah, but albert einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour."
8458,Howard,"the puppy died, it choked on a doll head. sad face, sad face!"
11651,Howard,told ya. can you fix it for us?
9087,Howard,"so, now all you have to do is let him win."
9365,Howard,"bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working, like, 17 hours a day. and i’ve got a lot on my plate, too, because i’ve been busting my tail playing assassin’s creed."
7999,Howard,what about that hook-up at comic-con you told me about?
8907,Howard,"you know, we could always drive to vegas and get married."
9571,Howard,it was better when you couldn’t talk to women.
11021,Howard,"here we are talking about frozen, and yet, you got burned."
7024,Howard,"alright, but next anything can happen thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar."
9227,Howard,sure. i can hear it in your voice.
7124,Howard,we could sit on the left side of the couch.
8463,Howard,"it might’ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss."
9558,Howard,it was really nice of you to try to be happy for leonard.
7324,Howard,of course it did.
9292,Howard,"okay, what’s next?"
11633,Howard,"we can just lock the door, you don’t have to kill him."
8028,Howard,it’s a bell.
6625,Howard,they gave him an assistant? if i want a new pen i have to go to the bank with wire cutters.
8036,Howard,"oh, yeah? won’t matter, you’re going down!"
10434,Howard,"yeah, i do."
11591,Howard,sometimes people say things they don’t mean.
8792,Howard,"oh, my dear boy, no. okay. next, this is a sexy french maid costume i bought for bernadette. i thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but i was wrong and really wrong."
8747,Howard,"yes, to other gay people."
9426,Howard,could work out. for all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere.
7259,Howard,"ooh, we’re honey now, are we?"
8652,Howard,my mom. sorry.
6443,Howard,"and even if you can make it to boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to mrs bell, “hey mrs bell, big fan of your husband, can i come in and watch him invent the telephone?”"
11989,Howard,"all right, we got a problem."
10266,Howard,that’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.
9546,Howard,oh.
9808,Howard,"um, is this getting weird?"
11630,Howard,"sheldon, we don’t need to make this smaller, and your work is done. go home."
7559,Howard,i thought i smelled popcorn.
6754,Howard,and a three hour dinner with penny.
6811,Howard,"here’s a crazy idea, ma, answer it!"
8721,Howard,"now, i downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. "
9767,Howard,really?
8731,Howard,"well, can you make it soon. there’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. in one corner, bernadette’s mom, and the other three, mine."
10470,Howard,"you believe in your religion, i’ll believe in mine."
11917,Howard,he says they didn’t do it.
10021,Howard,"what do you mean, yes?"
8860,Howard,"you’re right, he is! your dad’s gonna be furious. there’s no way he’s gonna let us postpone this wedding. well, we tried."
10315,Howard,"it’s not an allowance. it’s a stipend, and we said we weren’t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends."
10809,Howard,right? mamma-jamma just came to me.
10916,Howard,so we don’t even get to be up front where the action is?
9297,Howard,good idea. why don’t you get started on that?
11356,Howard,maybe that’s because it’s classified.
11655,Howard,"go. come on, raj."
9611,Howard,"oh, i loved those. i did them every year there."
6757,Howard,yes.
11424,Howard,"it’s called relaxing, and that’s all you need to know."
8660,Howard,i don’t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.
9144,Howard,"fine, i’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar."
10402,Howard,we were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.
10984,Howard,i know. it’s not like he returns the favour when he watches his japanese porn cartoons.
6418,Howard,"gentlemen, i believe i’ve found the solution to all our problems. "
11268,Howard,"me, too."
10504,Howard,what are you doing?
6886,Howard,say what?  that’s basically what i just said.
11457,Howard,"oh. well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?"
10362,Howard,you sure you’re okay?
11477,Howard,"i can keep this, right?"
9647,Howard,seriously?
6707,Howard,"god bless you, google street view registered trademark."
10736,Howard,"bernie, stuart just pulled up. so remember, the key is to be firm. show no weakness."
8837,Howard,do you want me to go?
7064,Howard,"great, just start."
9046,Howard,what?
10515,Howard,"i appreciate that, and i’m glad you were able to… is that my mother’s furniture?"
10152,Howard,"first of all, no one can replace me as a son. i’m her little matzo ball. and secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life."
6848,Howard,gee. why can’t sheldon make friends?
11143,Howard,hey.
11769,Howard,"look, i don’t know what the best decision is, either. but whatever we choose, if we’re not happy, we can undo it."
8193,Howard,not as good. you can’t make strings with it. remind me to put it on your shopping list.
10553,Howard,"well, i think you broke the dowels. you’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it."
9905,Howard,okay. just make it look like an accident.
10477,Howard,raj.
8864,Howard,"family pictures, or… holy crap, that’s a dead person."
10149,Howard,"i don’t know, they’re, chummy."
8624,Howard,great.
9973,Howard,you’re the reason i’m doing it.
6765,Howard,she’s not my type.
6238,Howard,morning ma’am. 
10357,Howard,not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.
10274,Howard,getting penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.
8757,Howard,yep.
11731,Howard,you sure you don’t fit in? you sound like a catty bitch to me.
8910,Howard,"okay, so we know we’re going to do it sunday morning. now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us."
10179,Howard,"sheldon, i’m more than smart enough to take your class."
6441,Howard,i was going to put down a towel. 
9657,Howard,"wait, wait, if it wasn’t for indiana jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse. "
6850,Howard,how much time you got?
6571,Howard,maybe you’d be happier on a park bench? 
9733,Howard,"whoa, where is that coming from?"
9089,Howard,so do it.
11071,Howard,are you serious?
8998,Howard,"great. just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting."
9975,Howard,"hey, buddy."
7706,Howard,she doesn’t know she takes them.
9306,Howard,"well, i wanted everybody to know i love my wife. and nobody to know i forgot to turn off the laser."
10389,Howard,i did. it’s all outdated or disproved.
6913,Howard,"court-martial, schmort-martial, leslie winkle is the fifth girl i’ve ever had sex with. i mean, for free."
8990,Howard,"no, no, i’m fine. no anxiety. we should probably talk in code. from now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. so, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon ’cause froggy wants to come home."
8215,Howard,"okay, october is the tenth month. so ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. turn over the seventh card."
7043,Howard,"look, there are plenty of bars in los angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them."
9359,Howard,"honestly, if i could bend that far, what would i need with you?"
11049,Howard,how?
9625,Howard,"yeah, i love neil diamond."
10247,Howard,"yes, i am. you know, i can’t even watch game of thrones now without thinking of mother saying, stuart, which one is thrones?"
6196,Howard,"raj, blow up the gates."
11455,Howard,"aw, you think you have an audience, that’s funny."
6699,Howard,i bet we could sell that sign all over pasadena.
9894,Howard,no need. i’m breaking rules all the time. 
6308,Howard,i’m with you. i just have to make sure if i’m a synthetic human i’d still be jewish. i promised my mother. 
10491,Howard,"okay, so it’s one vote emily, one vote cinnamon. penny, you’re the tiebreaker."
6931,Howard,bye.
7977,Howard,"actually, indian monopoly’s just like regular, except the money’s in rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. just fyi, that was racist."
8914,Howard,there’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go?
7425,Howard,we do?
7540,Howard,i respect that.  
11583,Howard,mm. except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.
9744,Howard,is the point that you’re an idiot?
6160,Howard,"think back, leonard, the littlest things can set women off. like, hey, the waitress is hot, i bet we could get her to come home with us. or, how much does your mom weigh, i want to know what i’m getting into."
9304,Howard,"leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler."
7150,Howard,damn his vulcan hearing.
8805,Howard,"all right, sheldon, there’s only one thing left i want you to do. don’t worry, it’s an easy one."
10801,Howard,"well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing."
11339,Howard,"and this is my friend, raj."
11369,Howard,why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?
8112,Howard,"apparently, if you’re sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back."
7335,Howard,it’s a date.
7143,Howard,crossbow.
10755,Howard,"ooh, brownies for girls’ night!"
7450,Howard,ouch.
10150,Howard,"no, not like us. creepy chummy, like you and your dog."
7497,Howard,"okay, i got a bone to pick with you."
8575,Howard,"look, i made sheldon disappear. ta-da."
9489,Howard,should i go?
10954,Howard,"so if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong guy."
11957,Howard,he’s not talking about your shirt. your shirt is fine.
6950,Howard,it can’t be. what would summer glau be doing riding the train?
9109,Howard,"boy, if these walls could talk."
7068,Howard,i don’t want to go anywhere.
7775,Howard,"or, as we call them, shamy."
6741,Howard,sheldon.
7868,Howard,but it’s embarrassing.
10548,Howard,why were you looking in it?
8869,Howard,"nice story. anyway, the reason i wanted to talk to you is nasa has moved up my launch to the international space station."
9139,Howard,not yet. what are you doing?
10910,Howard,"oh, i can’t. i’m going to the soup kitchen, too."
8542,Howard,i’m pushing play.
10468,Howard,no. there’s also apu from the simpsons.
7267,Howard,"okay, she’s gone."
6212,Howard,"maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side. "
7567,Howard,happy now?
9678,Howard,that’s not true.
11904,Howard,i’ll call you back when we firm up the details. it’s howard.
9518,Howard,"when this all blows over, remember that voice. it’s kind of a turn-on."
9757,Howard,"come on, it’ll be fun."
9191,Howard,you don’t need a parking space. you don’t have a car.
10208,Howard,what’s that about?
9717,Howard,you don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.
7296,Howard,"that reminds me, i have a bone to pick with you."
9855,Howard,"yeah, he’s nice because he likes you."
6995,Howard,"oh, stop with the fake third world crap. your father’s a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants."
9669,Howard,bernie…
10664,Howard,i saw the menu. they have soy cheese.
7797,Howard,but it’s frozen.
10944,Howard,i’ll keep rockin’. you don’t do that.
8062,Howard,a few extra bucks would be nice. i could finally move out of my mother’s house.
10785,Howard,"no. i took the other four off and when i got to this one, i thought, you know, i’m in a rut, let’s shake things up."
10582,Howard,"hey, guys."
7008,Howard,"oh, pish-posh.  shucks means shucks. let one go once in a while."
9696,Howard,"so, what happens next?"
8811,Howard,i gave it to him three days ago. he was really impressed. he wants to meet you.
6575,Howard,we’re just talking ma. 
6856,Howard,there are too many variables. it would take forever.
11276,Howard,yeah. he still has an aol address.
7585,Howard,why don’t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
6759,Howard,stephanie barnett is in a relationship with leonard hofstadter.”
10237,Howard,"i have a message for the young people here today. when i was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said i couldn’t do it. so, i practiced and practiced, and you know what? that little voice was right, but then i remembered that i’m not an athlete. i’m a scientist. so, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, i present to you a working prototype of the mars rover. and here’s the wind-up, and the pitch."
10262,Howard,"well, hear me out."
9011,Howard,"ma, who is in there?"
6868,Howard,"ooh, double sixes."
7692,Howard,i definitely smell raw hot dog.
11270,Howard,take a step back? i’m not a young man any more.
10568,Howard,it’s all defrosting.
8807,Howard,"no, about my job. i want you to tell me i’m good at what i do."
10824,Howard,"no, bernadette got me a fitbit so she can track how much i’m exercising."
7325,Howard,"i’m torn. she might be dying, and, you know, i wouldn’t want to miss that. on the other hand, if i let it go to voicemail, i could play it over and over."
10908,Howard,"so now anyone can control your phone? hey, siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
7214,Howard,"well, in case i snag one on someone’s nipple ring."
8311,Howard,"yeah, that’s probably it. so, what do you think? do you like her? she’s great, huh?"
7514,Howard,she had to go out of town. her grandmother died.
11974,Howard,"if i didn’t have you, life would be blue, i’d be dr. who without the tardis."
10010,Howard,while you confront your mother about her sex life? i’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
10900,Howard,"and no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment."
9442,Howard,he abandoned me and my mother. why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
9954,Howard,"look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? drop it."
11885,Howard,told you the sensor would work. 
10366,Howard,"so, how you doing?"
11881,Howard,you won’t believe this.
10283,Howard,okay. no. leonard’s right. we’re here to focus. didn’t we used to have a list of all our ideas?
11165,Howard,but we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.
7082,Howard,"really, me too."
8407,Howard,"why not? it’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, mom’s there to help. you know, when she tells the three little pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin."
10654,Howard,you don’t think i’m a leader?
9075,Howard,"yeah, i wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now."
11803,Howard,kids are always better at video games.
8413,Howard,"the bugs only come here because you’re their queen! listen, how about this. before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like."
7837,Howard,hello.
7239,Howard,"ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
7723,Howard,i’m out.
7055,Howard,"wow, you’re just going to make me come out and say it, aren’t you?"
11871,Howard,"oh boy, i was afraid of this."
7549,Howard,"i’m sure he would have if i had asked. ironically, their security isn’t all that good."
7904,Howard,"you said, well, the move, remember?"
6793,Howard,this one. let’s go.
6566,Howard,"did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door? "
8412,Howard,"yeah, well, i’m sorry i didn’t run it by you first."
8558,Howard,you are.
7570,Howard,"yeah, i am pulling out all the stops. there’s a $39.95 lover’s special at p.f. chang’s. egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front."
7431,Howard,"in romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more."
8130,Howard,you take this one. i spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can’t see themselves in the mirror?
6970,Howard,"so anyway, in the dream, you and i were ice skating, just the two of us. and then, i picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. i tried to stick them back on, but before i could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. what do you think that means?"
7777,Howard,"oh, god, that feels so good. yeah, that’s the spot. oh, baby."
9838,Howard,"oh, yeah"
7744,Howard,nope. why don’t you ask him?
11529,Howard,"we made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it."
10049,Howard,please don’t say it.
11713,Howard,"yeah. we barely use it, so it’ll be like it’s yours."
9923,Howard,not when i said mute and pointed it at her face.
10337,Howard,hey.
9828,Howard,more.
8021,Howard,perhaps. are you scared?
6795,Howard,see? sounds just like you and penny. we’ll take it.
9388,Howard,"you didn’t kill her and chop her up, that’s not what we’re smelling, right?"
7888,Howard,"well, not real girls."
7046,Howard,"that’s my system. oh, and if you spot a chick with a seeing eye dog, she’s mine."
8762,Howard,jews don’t have heaven.
6495,Howard,"fine. if i do have a threesome, you can’t be part of it. i’m just kidding, yes you can. can you bring a friend? "
8950,Howard,"okay, okay."
8213,Howard,"now remember your card, put it back in the deck."
7379,Howard,"okay, sorry."
9093,Howard,"what are you talking about? all i have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. ooh, there’s my plaid dickie. oh, got this at the goodwill store for 50 cents. can you believe it?"
11026,Howard,you’re a screenwriter?
8813,Howard,"sounds like loads of fun, but i promised bernadette no strippers."
7255,Howard,"right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub."
7527,Howard,why don’t you kids go ahead and chat? we’re gonna make out back here.
10679,Howard,just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.
11360,Howard,it’s pretty late. you think i’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?
10071,Howard,"well, my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from. unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit."
8314,Howard,"so i knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room."
8304,Howard,"hope so. of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl."
11155,Howard,"while we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with teflon tape."
11439,Howard,the guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore. 
11304,Howard,are you kidding? they’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.
8604,Howard,"i was upset. my mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of bengay doesn’t burn your eyes."
9282,Howard,oh.
8836,Howard,penny has a message for you.
8759,Howard,"i told you, no."
6711,Howard,she’s taller than all the women in my family combined.
10282,Howard,oh. i never saw that.
11758,Howard,"let me finish, and one card had five dollars in it i took from bernie’s purse."
7459,Howard,i prefer to think of myself as quirky.
11118,Howard,"see, he’s not wearing a tie."
11401,Howard,"well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
6484,Howard,"come on, come on, get up. "
6828,Howard,and then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. which brings us to tenth grade.
8791,Howard,way to go the extra mile. your mee-maw would be proud.
9593,Howard,"yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. that’s turkey and loganberry. and don’t tell my hips, but i’m warming up a brie in the oven."
10451,Howard,"nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about pluto, and it’s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on."
8144,Howard,yes!
7944,Howard,"are you kidding me? you’ve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with i’m sorry?"
6796,Howard,why couldn’t you have just done what leonard did and get penny a new boyfriend?
9199,Howard,would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
10615,Howard,"no, i’m not. settle this. those little animated pictures on the internet, are they called gifs or jifs?"
11491,Howard,his eyes also light up in the dark.
10316,Howard,it’s okay.
10769,Howard,right now.
8804,Howard,i don’t know.
7956,Howard,"uh-huh. i’m guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too."
8291,Howard,"it’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t it?"
7017,Howard,here we go.
11802,Howard,"no wonder they beat us, they’re jocks."
11179,Howard,really?
8590,Howard,"yes, you did. oh, i think my crotch is starting to curdle."
10952,Howard,really? you want to go down there and meet him?
11960,Howard,how about now?
11128,Howard,i guess that is a way around this. you guys would be cool doing it like that?
7269,Howard,"okay, guys, think, how do we keep raj in the country?"
8845,Howard,"yeah, so?"
11201,Howard,what? are you gonna cry?
11683,Howard,"no. i just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you."
6697,Howard,that’s what they said to neil armstrong about the moon.
10253,Howard,you say things like that all the time.
10349,Howard,don’t say it.
7607,Howard,you see what you’re doing? stop that.
7707,Howard,were you up making another stop-motion lego movie?
6410,Howard,some of us might have the correct answers too. 
11150,Howard,i should’ve known.
10174,Howard,why is it your last name and her first name?
10396,Howard,"well, there’s no discernible pattern that i can see, but it shouldn’t be too hard to run the numbers and check."
8175,Howard,that’s not really necessary.
7074,Howard,"first row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly."
11068,Howard,morning.
10967,Howard,"it’s like going with your grandpa. instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in tupperware and a thermos full of soup."
7823,Howard,gimme.
6559,Howard,"no, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so i’m going to slow down and spit it out.”"
11299,Howard,"i’m sorry, you find this funny?"
10299,Howard,jump ahead to the stay puft marshmallow man.
6790,Howard,"you’re kidding. you’ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that’s the estrogen hat trick."
9877,Howard,nope.
8841,Howard,howard wolowitz.
8223,Howard,"yeah, i was talking to raj."
8617,Howard,"leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you."
10704,Howard,"all right, the power supply is reconnected. i think we’re back in business. let’s just run a few tests before we take it outside. sheldon, we got wifi?"
10415,Howard,and tell them that we compromised all the equipment? let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.
10642,Howard,good for you.
10412,Howard,how the hell did a pigeon get in here?
10898,Howard,then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from mordor to the shire.
9660,Howard,"i’m just saying, i’d never want to work with bernadette. can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you’re supposed to hang out with them after work, too?"
9731,Howard,"you know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where i can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your dna in it."
10088,Howard,"okay, so you’d lose most of jar jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching c-span with monsters."
10376,Howard,"i just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. although, there are ways to improve our communication. one thing i learned when i was in couples therapy was…"
7001,Howard,"sorry, guys, but secret agent laser obstacle lunch is just stupid."
9578,Howard,both versions: original and lohan. you’re an idiot.
7440,Howard,"hey, just because you settled doesn’t mean i have to."
11544,Howard,we have named her halley.
9737,Howard,you’re right. i didn’t realize i was making you feel that way. it was very brave of you to tell me.
6923,Howard,"oh, there’s the arrhythmia."
6833,Howard,"yes, i slipped and fell. in the bathroom. bounced right off the tub."
9037,Howard,"but you know what wasn’t a party? that hotel in kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. i mean, it’s your last night on earth. you’d think you’d get one porn channel."
9898,Howard,"oh, no. i’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?"
9241,Howard,"fine. sorry, mr. worm. sherm. sherm the worm."
10537,Howard,i could’ve driven her.
7309,Howard,great. so what did you tell her about me? did you mention the body fat?
8597,Howard,"i don’t know. i can’t see a life where i don’t have kids. i mean, people have kids. i mean, even donkey kong had donkey kong jr. so he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at italian plumbers."
8399,Howard,"all right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go.  yeah, well, now it means her."
11220,Howard,there you go again.
8905,Howard,"uh, shouldn’t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?"
9529,Howard,ready whenever you guys are.
7767,Howard,coming up. 
10023,Howard,were you like this when i married you?
7824,Howard,trust me.
9245,Howard,here we go. oh!
11173,Howard,what is he doing in there?
10463,Howard,you love that movie.
10054,Howard,"i’m sorry. i tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere."
6511,Howard,"come on, afterwards there’s a q & a with harrison ford’s body double. "
11034,Howard,what?
11984,Howard,"we will, we will percussive shock you."
11245,Howard,i’m fine. just a little embarrassed i had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. thanks.
6457,Howard,"sorry i’m late, i’m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle."
9202,Howard,"oh, like you’ve never thought of doing that. don’t hate me just because i lived the dream.  "
9587,Howard,like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.
10118,Howard,what took you so long? the grocery store is a few blocks away.
9461,Howard,nice try. that’s the plot for goonies.
6595,Howard,you mean like you and richard the slave girl?
10897,Howard,congratulations.
7286,Howard,"what do you guys think? want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?"
9362,Howard,"hey, you wanted a woman in your life. now you got one."
7637,Howard,all right. i’ll bet your meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother. i bet she had sex because she liked it.
10263,Howard,"i know, but all the guys are doing it. we’re splitting it four ways, so it’s really not that much money."
9423,Howard,you said clean up. i’m cleaning up.
7411,Howard,"okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. easy target. big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos."
9004,Howard,you okay?
7274,Howard,"tell you what, we’ll skype."
10425,Howard,"again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys."
6172,Howard,"oh, he speaks english, he just can’t speak to women."
9807,Howard,give me that. just stop showing me up.
7582,Howard,i’m sad to say i taught him those moves.
9101,Howard,"now that you mention it, i was thinking tomorrow might not be great."
10901,Howard,i’ve been telling women that for 20 years.
8287,Howard,most of those guys live in texas.
11632,Howard,"i don’t care if we’re in a drought, it’s worth it."
7773,Howard,borrowed. the trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
7253,Howard,"okay. we got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place."
7175,Howard,"okay, first of all…"
11214,Howard,"i know. scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up."
6548,Howard,you just called leonard a syphilitic donkey. 
7916,Howard,"come on, just give her a chance. maybe she’ll grow on you."
11041,Howard,hello.
7275,Howard,hello.
10092,Howard,"well, at least without sheldon here, we got to start with episode iv."
9480,Howard,"i think you’re gonna be really happy with this security camera. the optics are great, it’s got infrared technology, and there’s even a backup battery when the power goes out."
7510,Howard,"bernadette, please, i’m asking you to give me another chance."
10790,Howard,"no, it’s too broad of a beam. you’d need something more precise, like superman’s heat vision."
10200,Howard,"okay. you enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?"
9914,Howard,sorry.
9997,Howard,i was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. but an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.
10369,Howard,what are you talking about? we’re fine. and raj’s parents probably split up because of raj.
9987,Howard,"oh, this is nothing. i experienced way worse when i was plummeting back to earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. okay, that was a big one."
8961,Howard,"funny. we’re always giving each other a hard time up here. it’s kind of like being in a frat. you know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings."
8177,Howard,"that’s very nice of you, but i made other plans."
8879,Howard,"all right, look, i’m gonna level with you. i’m terrified about going into space. what if i don’t make it back?"
10806,Howard,"is it cold in here, ’cause, oh, my."
10850,Howard,who’s dave?
9619,Howard,it’s the comic book store. let’s go.
10962,Howard,they’re not supposed to be available yet.
6638,Howard,"sheldon, not that we don’t all enjoy a good lion semen story, what’s your point."
11188,Howard,raj just pulled up. i’m gonna say something to him.
6979,Howard,terminator broke my phone.
10443,Howard,i am tasting a lot of slim jim.
6616,Howard,he can feel sadness?
11495,Howard,"fine, i will."
9746,Howard,you didn’t have smokey the bear in india?
9391,Howard,now what?
10798,Howard,"hey, stuart."
8115,Howard,"actually, we should all share the moment. raj, if you would."
6802,Howard,it’s a big deal. there’s an awards banquet and a dance afterward. perhaps you’d like to come with me. i know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.
8760,Howard,"no, you said, would it help if i said i’m sorry?"
10841,Howard,"if you need liquid helium so bad, i know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions."
11247,Howard,"well, we’re out. bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. and she’s pregnant because we had sex. and we had sex because, well, come on."
10057,Howard,"well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you."
10403,Howard,seriously?
8375,Howard,fine with me.
9022,Howard,"wow, so you guys are like buds now?"
6716,Howard,"step one, she notices the eye patch. may i say, penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? "
10577,Howard,"ma always kept it on hand, in case i got sick. she thought she could cure anything with her cooking. even the time i got food poisoning. from her cooking."
8173,Howard,"yeah, some work thing. anyway, my mother seems to think that bernadette…"
9017,Howard,"yeah. the lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so i’m like an inch and a half taller. i’m going to the dmv tomorrow to get my license changed before i shrink back."
10838,Howard,"oh, boy."
7468,Howard,yeah?
6338,Howard,then call your own mother.  it was sheldon.
6691,Howard,just put it back before he comes!
8406,Howard,why would she move out? it’s her house.
10788,Howard,exactly. i’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever.
6572,Howard,do you want to switch?
6211,Howard,"sheldon, if you were a robot, and i knew and you didn’t, would you want me to tell you?"
7836,Howard,hey. aren’t you going to introduce us to your little friend?
7207,Howard,"well, could you look at toby?"
10466,Howard,"yeah, but you’re a scientist."
6791,Howard,"come on, bath stuff, it’s perfect! you got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation."
6267,Howard,chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .
10336,Howard,how is this helpful?
10875,Howard,"oh, my god, we’re gonna die."
8052,Howard,i’m batman.
6634,Howard,"oh goody, more tales from the panhandle."
9641,Howard,"hey, wait a minute. no, the nazis were digging in the wrong place. the only reason they got the ark was because indy found it first."
6374,Howard,"something’s got to be done about him, leonard."
7521,Howard,"there might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and i don’t want bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and penny made out, too."
8341,Howard,where are you going?
6910,Howard,"great, ’cause i’ve been dying to say something."
11923,Howard,"hey, raj, guess what. professor laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team."
6621,Howard,dr gablehauser.
9857,Howard,maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. does he know you’re dating sheldon?
9537,Howard,the dungeon master’s supposed to roll.
10374,Howard,"okay. the truth is, sometimes, you’re too beautiful."
9321,Howard,amazing. you realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.
8219,Howard,"that’s your card, right?"
9848,Howard,"well, i’d be able to tell anyway."
6339,Howard,"it’s my own fault, i forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of ’06. "
6279,Howard,"sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he’s charging his plasma rifle. "
6328,Howard,"i know it’s the phone, ma, i hear the phone."
8012,Howard,"yeah, but who’d want to become rat-man?"
21716,Howard,nice.
11147,Howard,i’m on board.
8772,Howard,"something got you down there, bunky?"
6632,Howard,so you’re just going to sit around here and mope while penny is out with doctor apu from the kwik-e-mart?
11991,Howard,for joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.
10673,Howard,why would he own a t-shirt cannon?
10120,Howard,"a mocha? well, it must be nice to be queen."
7292,Howard,unless you have the carrot power.
8384,Howard,"you know, the virtual pickle tickle. the digital bow-chicka-bow-bow."
11054,Howard,"well, how do we do that?"
6653,Howard,"here we go, red 2006 ford taurus on the streets of pasadena."
8986,Howard,"i don’t know how much longer i can take this. i can’t sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. i’m down to my last three tums."
7709,Howard,how is a japanese love pillow another person?
7795,Howard,can you please just help me?
10524,Howard,hold that thought.  hello?
9293,Howard,"oh, my god. leonard, someone’s stealing your car!"
6947,Howard,for taking daffodils to your unicorn.
6821,Howard,people move away from her on the bus. what do you want?
9835,Howard,you can say better. sheldon can’t hear you.
11603,Howard,"no, he doesn’t think it’s stupid."
11703,Howard,"raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and i wrote india."
11222,Howard,"oh, i wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me."
8150,Howard,you know it’s meant as a compliment.
9927,Howard,i told them i’d be honoured.
9418,Howard,"no, i’m an american hero. your uncle brings people nuts, okay?"
6300,Howard,and you have no wrath. 
6851,Howard,"me, me. let it be me."
10832,Howard,he’s a righty.
10394,Howard,sing hakuna matata like an eight-year-old girl?
10100,Howard,crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.
9995,Howard,we can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. we should bring something.
8001,Howard,hey.
6222,Howard,oh yeah.
10961,Howard,nope.
6187,Howard,"really? you? rajesh koothrapali, spoke to penny?"
8954,Howard,"i love you, too. sweet dreams. i’ll talk to you tomorrow?"
10450,Howard,will you please relax?
6967,Howard,look.
11279,Howard,"if you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines."
8614,Howard,i’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with penny.
7925,Howard,"so, you got any special plans with your sister?"
10062,Howard,i need some fresh air.
10131,Howard,"you know, if you’re really serious about that, i hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat."
9439,Howard,it’s this stupid letter.
11411,Howard,we should call the police.
10380,Howard,all right.
6915,Howard,"well, it’s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
7964,Howard,ooh. can’t wait for that to start.
9940,Howard,massimino? why are you here?
9596,Howard,seriously?
7034,Howard,so what are you kids up to?
9246,Howard,"hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go."
7322,Howard,how about computers? do you like computers?
9449,Howard,"sheldon, i swear to god, i’m gonna kill you."
8520,Howard,"come on, admit it. we got you, sheldon."
10447,Howard,can’t do what?
9459,Howard,"oh, honey, i am in no mood to have sex tonight. i’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… oh. what are you guys doing here?"
10161,Howard,this is stupid. i’m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.
11005,Howard,i don’t know.
6510,Howard,"no, you’ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut. this one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. they say it completely changes the tone of the film. "
7975,Howard,that’s a stupid question.
11619,Howard,"if you didn’t want me to eat it, why’d you put it out?"
8653,Howard,"no problem, fruit loops."
6514,Howard,"yeah, no. "
6534,Howard,"don’t toy with me, woman. "
9608,Howard,"whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry."
7914,Howard,why the hell would you cross ebola with the common cold?
6801,Howard,"oh yeah, they still got the full monte."
8535,Howard,i guess.
11845,Howard,i found it right next to these kisses.
11017,Howard,"wait, that’s an option? i didn’t know that was an option."
9795,Howard,why bother? she spends half the time licking her butt.
10529,Howard,"no, it’s okay. what?"
11811,Howard,"uh, hold on. there’s an old saying in juggling."
8298,Howard,nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.
11311,Howard,"i’m telling you, i’m not on drugs. the government’s out to get me."
9612,Howard,"oh, that’s cute. like it’s a real college."
10353,Howard,"‘cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship."
8867,Howard,"no, thank you. i’m allergic."
11159,Howard,remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?
9041,Howard,creature from the black forest ham lagoon.
7668,Howard,i thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.
8934,Howard,"okay, ma, great talking to you. gotta go. well, space is ruined."
7789,Howard,don’t come up here!
7843,Howard,"why are you in bed with me? if we start to question this, it all falls apart."
6473,Howard,"so what, you’ve already got penny. "
9736,Howard,"buddy, i was just joking around. "
11200,Howard,"but on the other hand, i didn’t kick him out of our lives. i just asked him to back off a little."
8085,Howard,really? you want to see the keynote?
7095,Howard,"look, i was going over the schematics on my zero-g toilet, and i made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve."
7223,Howard,"nice to meet you, bethany."
9639,Howard,halle berry. why?
7719,Howard,we broke up weeks ago.
11894,Howard,what if guests show up?
6837,Howard,"hey, i’m thinking of growing a mustache."
9230,Howard,"well, hang on a second, bernie. next weekend, we have that thing."
8355,Howard,what’s up?
11174,Howard,you know what wasn’t anti-climactic? the end of the movie. get this.
6429,Howard,he doesn’t have it. he’s got squat.
7524,Howard,"flesh-eating bacteria. and yet, i still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?"
10311,Howard,talk about wasted money. what about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?
11604,Howard,"hey, you went out with him. i didn’t."
8293,Howard,nice to see that the gals are getting along.
9270,Howard,good story.
8639,Howard,"yeah, terrific. the other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named crash."
10999,Howard,i’ll give it to him next time i see him.
6933,Howard,"yeah, gee, i’d really rather not."
6394,Howard,"yeah, let’s go with that. "
8294,Howard,"okay, well, it’s getting late. this was terrific. you win. bernie?"
11549,Howard,"the baby’s asleep, can we put her in your room?"
10939,Howard,we did raise the roof that night.
7504,Howard,same thing you’re doing here. i came to see leonard’s experiment.
8438,Howard,with dungeons and dragons dice?
11723,Howard,never should’ve had all these kids so close together.
8599,Howard,"i don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker."
11533,Howard,"so, what are we gonna name this kid? now that we know she’s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for wally wolowitz."
8082,Howard,we’re going to be hundred-aires.
10405,Howard,"yeah for you, not for me. i went to space. i’m covered."
7491,Howard,sorry about that.
8838,Howard,i get that.
11349,Howard,four months?
7933,Howard,"hey, i didn’t see you giving back your snoopy snowcone maker."
6781,Howard,there are always do-overs when my people play sports.
7185,Howard,"no, you’re misunderstanding. a shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them, we prey on them."
9398,Howard,"oh, come on, raj."
8833,Howard,i need to talk to bernadette.
11213,Howard,so does that answer your question?
6360,Howard,"hang on, the sensor’s picking up something, turn your head back.  "
8793,Howard,"no, no, no, mon petit cherie."
8211,Howard,"here, shuffle these."
9023,Howard,"okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?"
6669,Howard,my mom’s making a brisket tonight.
9957,Howard,"hey, that’s my wife. if anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it’s me."
10856,Howard,never mind.
8449,Howard,he likes your eyes.
6381,Howard,"no, i just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did. "
8335,Howard,"don’t worry, you’ll be fine. let’s just hide mr. cross. if it touches her, it burns."
10365,Howard,"told you, not funny."
10066,Howard,"oh, well, turns out i’d already met the girl raj is seeing when i did a number on her bathroom. and that number was two."
10290,Howard,what?
6863,Howard,he has a nervous bladder when he’s stressed out. kind of like a puppy.
11642,Howard,open a window. it’s about to get smug in here.
7461,Howard,don’t you just hate when this happens?
9605,Howard,"i said, stop it. now, listen to me. you two aren’t just friends. you’re best friends. and that’s a beautiful thing. i mean, leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? it’s ’cause he missed you. yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. as i do. this man held my breast the other day and i love him for it."
9474,Howard,asthma attack?
9730,Howard,"i was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck. she’s just chins and fat and feet."
9825,Howard,she nailed it.
7117,Howard,"okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. "
7842,Howard,anything.
7141,Howard,i didn’t say that. you never listen to me!
7101,Howard,"all right, this is an exact duplicate of the wolowitz zero-gravity human waste disposal system as deployed on the international space station."
8743,Howard,"okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy."
6379,Howard,"you know, biology? the one thing that can completely derail a world class mind. "
7881,Howard,"same. i took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out i’m terrified of the ocean."
9160,Howard,"ah, it took him two years to put together that lego death star, i’m not worried."
9689,Howard,just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing i do next.
9396,Howard,"come on, she came back. this is good news. you should celebrate."
8292,Howard,sure.
7400,Howard,not much to tell. they had a vw microbus and were wearing tie-dyed grateful dead shirts.
10819,Howard,i don’t need this. i’m quitting the band.
6762,Howard,"so, the girlfriend’s buying clothes for you, huh? sounds serious."
9959,Howard,"hey, i work at the same university you do."
9003,Howard,"sweetie, we don’t have to do this now."
8010,Howard,"no, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot."
9024,Howard,"sound of music sing-along? that used to be our thing, but that’s cool."
9478,Howard,you could talk some smack about his mother.
9457,Howard,"i got to tell you, as angry as i am at sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. look at this. photos of wolowitz family before father left forever. check out nine-year-old howie with cornrows. neither race was happy to see me with those."
10037,Howard,you got it.
10069,Howard,"okay, but she’d feel better if she took her medicine."
8501,Howard,little bit.
10857,Howard,"oh. making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died."
11257,Howard,"oh, good."
8454,Howard,"she says, do you play an instrument?"
8536,Howard,why are they asking me about this stuff? what guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is? 
11027,Howard,"he does, and he has the lilo & stitch collector plates to prove it."
6260,Howard,"see a penny, pick her up, and all the day you’ll have good luck."
6756,Howard,"i’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter how much you put on."
10747,Howard,"yeah. i mean, not like our wedding beautiful."
7165,Howard,"oh, right, and i do? my people already crossed a desert once, we’re done."
10520,Howard,your store? my mother gave you the money to reopen. i’m not going anywhere.
9078,Howard,why?
6268,Howard,"let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn’t christie stay with me."
7403,Howard,"stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
7388,Howard,how much time do we have?
6590,Howard,you’re only saying that because of what happened to you.
11124,Howard,"wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and i get nothing?"
8210,Howard,"hey, raj, wanna see a new magic trick i’ve been working on?"
10510,Howard,"mmm, she loves it. she finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on stuart because he might be lonely."
11641,Howard,how’d you even get that up the stairs?
10322,Howard,a gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra.
10278,Howard,my cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
9172,Howard,"oh, my god!"
9694,Howard,"or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar."
8140,Howard,i’m gonna go hit the bar.
6276,Howard,"yay! if you’ll excuse me, i have some bar-mizvah bonds to cash. "
7791,Howard,don’t tug. no tugging.
10547,Howard,so?
9136,Howard,come on.
21705,Howard,why?
6906,Howard,hey.
8283,Howard,"that’s interesting. can you just switch restaurants like that, priya?"
10621,Howard,"hey, i grew up in this house, okay? no one’s knocking anything down."
8006,Howard,uh-uh.
10197,Howard,you reported me to human resources?
6345,Howard,"sorry, don’t you have a spare."
7965,Howard,"oh, shut up."
9470,Howard,that’s terrible.
8090,Howard,yeah. it’s the love car.
10814,Howard,"you played it for emily, didn’t you?"
6296,Howard,"i’d say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail. "
11077,Howard,"how’s it gonna be okay? look at me, i’m a mess. and that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. and that’s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny."
7133,Howard,and you think you can put up with sheldon?
11110,Howard,don’t say that to him.
6492,Howard,"you think? go ahead, tell her about your senior prom. "
11215,Howard,i know. imagine if we were actually moving.
9886,Howard,"oh, and i thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over."
8972,Howard,what am i supposed to say?
10853,Howard,"oh, no, not this again."
6237,Howard,"i shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster. "
9060,Howard,"yeah, some friends. they all think i’m boring. maybe you should go without me."
7128,Howard,"we’re not really gonna go to the north pole with him, are we?"
10820,Howard,then get out of my house.
8116,Howard,"fyi, i think that’s what darth vader said just before he started building the death star."
10777,Howard,you don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to mexico.
7486,Howard,"no, no, don’t move. hey, ma, can i have lamb stew for dinner?"
10653,Howard,"in social groupings, i just naturally wind up in charge."
9786,Howard,"mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me."
8945,Howard,"what do you want, ma?"
6752,Howard,look at leonard’s record. 27 days with joyce kim.
9703,Howard,"oh, my god, bernie, what happened?"
8420,Howard,ready for bed?
8993,Howard,the jewish prayer for eating bread! we don’t have one for falling out of space! we did it! we’re on the ground! we survived!
6601,Howard,what the frak?
9799,Howard,"well, i keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone."
8214,Howard,"remind me, what’s your birthday?"
7636,Howard,then let go of the ring and walk away.
9250,Howard,"sir, i’m flattered that you invited me, and i really want you to like me, but i don’t think this trip is the way to do it. and i can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them."
10286,Howard,there’s just some things you don’t do with your robot girlfriend.
10292,Howard,"or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling."
8076,Howard,we’re not quitting on leonard.
6347,Howard,well?
11341,Howard,"marty, let me call you back."
11333,Howard,"why? because i’m jewish? that’s like me saying, hey, you’re indian, doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre?"
9983,Howard,"when? how about in the car? i’m an astronaut, and you know it. you just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous."
10829,Howard,and maybe a little princess bride.
10359,Howard,"so i found this fencing school in burbank that has a jedi class. and if you’re cool being the only adults there, they said they are."
11978,Howard,"everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!"
7695,Howard,"well, that’s it. we’re officially out of things to talk about."
7442,Howard,"thank you, sheldon."
11932,Howard,"oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too."
11462,Howard,"so, if i actually know something right now, and i do, you don’t want me to tell you?"
6651,Howard,this is a state-of-the-art simulator. i adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
7045,Howard,"it’s way too early in the night for that. see, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame."
9072,Howard,i love you.
7434,Howard,"excuse me, i have a master’s degree in engineering from the massachusetts institute of technology. it required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis."
9376,Howard,"look, we can still have a nice night. just tell me where it is."
10085,Howard,you sure. not even coffee? we have r2-decaf. maybe a nice cafe au leia?
9521,Howard,"it’s not her. i just googled foo-foo little dogs.  it’s raj. stay quiet. hey, bad timing. bernadette just took cinnamon out for a walk."
9067,Howard,"no, i’m not. they’re all being rude. and you’re being rude."
11807,Howard,"all right, this is everything. what do you want to learn?"
10600,Howard,"that’s not fair, she has upper body muscles."
6730,Howard,"hang on, there’s got to be other options."
9665,Howard,it’s nothing in particular. i…
7092,Howard,"hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?"
9726,Howard,sorry we’re late. i wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.
10879,Howard,"all right, i admit that i don’t help out a lot. and i need to work on that. but if we had a kid, it would be different."
9670,Howard,"please, stop talking."
7867,Howard,"oh, i’d rather not say."
10539,Howard,"oh, thank god. it’s okay, she’s here. ma’s here."
10119,Howard,then why do i smell coffee on your breath?
9028,Howard,at least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.
6513,Howard,"oh my god, do you smell gas."
9411,Howard,"well, they’re actually pretty excited. i’m their most famous alum. if you don’t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes."
8285,Howard,i’m not going to help you. this is hilarious.
9861,Howard,"oh, i’ve heard those words so many times. from linda nosenchuck, tammy rosenworcel."
6618,Howard,"oh crap, that’s terrifying."
7334,Howard,a catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm i’ve been hoping for.
8483,Howard,you’re really quiet. is everything okay?
7734,Howard,"no, it’s not… never mind. he is right, though. if you want, i can turn you on to this great new dating site i found."
6688,Howard,"isn’t it obvious? every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future mrs. howard wolowitz."
10404,Howard,"i guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life."
7152,Howard,"yeah, we’ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the north pole."
6402,Howard,kryptonian villain. long story.
7105,Howard,good. get out.
11815,Howard,"i don’t know, maybe."
11715,Howard,i don’t know. why are you asking all these questions?
6223,Howard,"hey, look who’s come out…."
7803,Howard,"oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars."
8482,Howard,"well, i mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you chernobyl."
8960,Howard,excuse me. i’m talking to my friends.
11364,Howard,"well, i don’t know, midnight, one."
10808,Howard,"oh yes, definitely. hang on. thunder clapped as thor raised his mighty hammer. indy rapped, that’s one bad mamma-jamma."
8079,Howard,fine. let’s say it together.
10800,Howard,what kind of music are you thinking of?
9395,Howard,"okay. but i gotta warn you, raj is a proud, passionate man. if you go running out on him again, you’re only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history."
8846,Howard,"well, their technology isn’t that bad."
11761,Howard,love you more. 
11513,Howard,get stuart or raj to do it.
11131,Howard,this contract looks good to me.
8101,Howard,"yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, i wouldn’t have a chance, right?"
7753,Howard,"and that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”"
10102,Howard,"please, i’m an mit-trained engineer. i think i can handle… ma, look out."
11176,Howard,"hey, where you been?"
11927,Howard,"…bernadette! thank you, cheesecake factory!"
11602,Howard,you’re so stupid.
7829,Howard,what?
7702,Howard,so you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
8675,Howard,"no. i’m not mad at you. i just wish you would have come to me, so i didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine."
8665,Howard,a pre-nup? wow.
11096,Howard,i’m not finding anything either.
8015,Howard,"leonard, settle this. of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?"
11075,Howard,"but how’s this all gonna work? do we get a nanny? i mean, can we afford a nanny? and if we can, we can’t get a pretty one, ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage. we can’t get an ugly one, ’cause it’ll scare the kid."
10909,Howard,"oh. cool.  hey, siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
6626,Howard,"oh, gee, thanks."
9399,Howard,"boy, i want to tell you it’s her loss, but you are not making it easy."
7802,Howard,really? you’re changing the sheldonian calendar?
10731,Howard,i didn’t touch it. must have been stuart.
9958,Howard,is that book called lies i tell to get sex?
9515,Howard,cinnamon!
9027,Howard,"absolutely. see you, stuart."
6257,Howard,no. call leonard hofstadter.
6249,Howard,"i’m going to use the mirror technique. she brushes her hair back, i brush my hair back, she shrugs, i shrug, subconsciously she’s thinking we’re in sync, we belong together."
8182,Howard,"oh, uh…"
10514,Howard,you really did a nice job.
7039,Howard,"well, if i get lucky, i don’t want to be caught in my aquaman briefs."
6775,Howard,"hey, isn’t that the guy who won the macarthur genius grant last year? no, not all at once."
6956,Howard,"um, well, let’s see, couple reasons. one, i saw her first."
8439,Howard,"so, what’s for dinner?"
10166,Howard,your mother and i? you’re not my father.
11925,Howard,"raj, what are you doing here? you were supposed to help me pimp out my vespa."
8491,Howard,i’ve been offered a chance to go up to the international space station for three weeks. what are your thoughts on that?
11338,Howard,"well, i married a little catholic girl, so we’re even. anyway, this is leonard and sheldon. the three of us came up with the guidance system."
10269,Howard,what?
9856,Howard,"you know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend bert, it’s totally okay."
8240,Howard,want me to tell you how to do it?
8178,Howard,hey.
8802,Howard,"yeah, i made an adjustment on the motor drive and when i was putting it back together i could not for the life of me figure out where they went."
6854,Howard,"suddenly i’m looking pretty good, huh?"
11094,Howard,"and since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence."
8053,Howard,i had to walk. i couldn’t get raj on the back of my scooter.
8913,Howard,leaking? what’s leaking?
8890,Howard,"no, here."
10437,Howard,"it was an accident. oh, my god. oh, my god."
9036,Howard,that’s not true. at the walgreens i was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.
8803,Howard,i should have sent you to the custom car cover place in altadena. they have her pattern on file.
11116,Howard,"okay, i gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?"
10126,Howard,"she’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse."
10007,Howard,"that’s some tough talk, i may need to cut you off."
7368,Howard,"yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me."
10305,Howard,"i brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too."
11058,Howard,he is. should we name him?
10594,Howard,"well, i guess as long as you’re keeping an open mind."
8357,Howard,"ma, can rajesh sleep over?!"
6173,Howard,he’s kind of a nerd. juice box?
8250,Howard,"so, how do you guys want to play this?"
9533,Howard,what are you doing back?
10803,Howard,"it was for this power trio i tried to put together in junior high, but i was short two friends."
9821,Howard,really? sheldon not being here is the main reason i’m in this room.
6904,Howard,i agree. how exactly do we do that? 
7871,Howard,her name was glissinda the troll. bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the bridge of souls.
8489,Howard,do you realize what a big deal this is? what an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?
8725,Howard,but i worked hard to get this armour.
7537,Howard,au contraire. it meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
7456,Howard,"this will only take a second. you asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and i did. bernadette? will you marry me?"
10041,Howard,"in a bad way, very bad."
7621,Howard,fine. he can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.
11043,Howard,does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
9286,Howard,"i’m sorry, i’m a feminist, i don’t notice things like how many breasts a robot has."
9134,Howard,"hey, alex, do you know where your boss just went?"
10333,Howard,"hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren’t dating."
6517,Howard,"don’t yell at me, i’ve got to go to the emergency room. "
6366,Howard,"i’ve been at this lab for three years, you’ve never came by to say hello."
6864,Howard,ugh. this mu-shu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum.
6168,Howard,"enchante madamoiselle. howard wolowitz, cal-tech department of applied physics. you may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs."
6474,Howard,so i can have penny?
11398,Howard,wrong number.
10716,Howard,kiss-ass.
9091,Howard,don’t take it personally. she likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.
11512,Howard,that’d be great.
8331,Howard,no!
9071,Howard,you’re just saying that.
6883,Howard,"oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad."
9173,Howard,"yeah, really sorry."
7012,Howard,"oh, my god! girl fight! "
9110,Howard,yeah. i can’t believe i’m not going to live here anymore. this has always been my bedroom. right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
11134,Howard,"bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out."
9313,Howard,"oh, yeah? how’s that?"
11321,Howard,that’s really stupid advice.
8613,Howard,why?
6206,Howard,because he looked better than you?
10756,Howard,"look, i know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself."
11644,Howard,all right. hmm. feel free to jump in. hmm is all i got.
6302,Howard,"gentlemen, i am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local isp, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to san francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to lisbon, portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in halifax, nova-scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our isp and the x10 receiver attached to this . "
10399,Howard,"oh, let’s do that."
9159,Howard,that stuff’s radioactive.
8800,Howard,"oh, guys, i just remembered. i got you some hawking souvenirs."
6428,Howard,then guess.
9315,Howard,"yeah, but they’re so expensive."
6682,Howard,why is that mrs. wolowitz crying?
6717,Howard,ow.
10178,Howard,"i’m thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. why not?"
10428,Howard,stay out of this.
6963,Howard,what?
9380,Howard,"yeah, maybe tonight. but a year from now, he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his xbox. well, he will."
6823,Howard,"hey, i’m a big boy. i’m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. i mean, get over yourself."
10786,Howard,what are you doing?
9386,Howard,you in there?
11767,Howard,"oh. okay, well, i get that. it was hard for me when i went back."
7212,Howard,really?
8007,Howard,"yeah, i get it now."
9063,Howard,who cares?
11661,Howard,and the car ride puts her to sleep.
7140,Howard,"ma, i’m putting you on speakerphone with raj’s parents. can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the arctic?"
8326,Howard,"bernie, wait!"
9949,Howard,you’ve got to get me out of this.
7268,Howard,so?
7340,Howard,"yes, she did."
11384,Howard,"yeah, we could name him blobert."
11854,Howard,how’s sheldon doing with amy gone?
6598,Howard,yeah.
8533,Howard,oy. bernadette keeps texting me pictures of penny in bridesmaid dresses.
11465,Howard,"it just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juh qachhom dotlh sov ‘iv "
8933,Howard,"ma, please. everyone from nasa is listening to this phone call."
7250,Howard,"fine, they smelled good."
8248,Howard,"redheaded troll, goes by the name of glumly. according to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it’s after school hours, he’s your guy."
7772,Howard,you kidding? they still think it’s in a secure locker at jpl.
7758,Howard,"okay, i’m out."
6162,Howard,it’s a stephen hawking lecture from mit in 1974.
10676,Howard,"step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times."
11288,Howard,we’re near the front of the line. we’ll get in either way.
7482,Howard,huh?
6645,Howard,this madness has to stop.
6709,Howard,"yes, we here to fix the cable."
6768,Howard,"you know, if you can’t talk to her, why don’t you just text her?"
11936,Howard,"no, no, no. he won. suck it up."
11833,Howard,but why would you do that?
11167,Howard,"well, i keep telling you, good things happen to bad people."
7714,Howard,"yeah, right. dr. plimpton?"
11515,Howard,fine. who wants to drive me to the store?
10321,Howard,we know.
9262,Howard,can we please move this along?
6987,Howard,why not eliminate the middle man? we could install a small server farm with a static ip in her bedroom.
9326,Howard,say hello to my little friend.
7746,Howard,not us. him.
8741,Howard,"what do you mean, she’s a lesbian?"
6471,Howard,bye missy.
6294,Howard,"no, no, let’s see how long it takes him."
9314,Howard,i have always wanted a 3-d printer.
7657,Howard,are you saying he’s man-struating?
9238,Howard,okay.
9507,Howard,"she really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?"
8984,Howard,"well, remember the soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?"
6628,Howard,that would be cool. i’d go to that reception.
11331,Howard,"sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years."
7911,Howard,"just fyi, don’t try to go back with a fake moustache. i mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that."
6319,Howard,uh-huh?
7116,Howard,"damn right it’s heavy, it’s my mother’s meat loaf, it’s been testing toilets for generations."
6930,Howard,"okay, there are two ways of looking at this…"
11658,Howard,"yes, he is."
9852,Howard,anybody home?
8307,Howard,"so, how’d it go?"
10602,Howard,so it’s settled. the fate of doctor who’s tardis will be decided by a game of thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of thundercats versus transformers.
7584,Howard,"ow! damn, paper cut. nothing worse than a paper cut."
6346,Howard,"unless sheldon’s there, in which case you’ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web. "
9466,Howard,"that’s pretty cool. thank you, guys."
10750,Howard,i don’t know. it’s a mess. they had a huge fight in vegas.
11082,Howard,"oh, my god, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?"
7995,Howard,it might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.
9251,Howard,‘cause bernadette made me.
10763,Howard,"dude, just because we’re best friends doesn’t mean that i have to tell you everything that goes on."
7047,Howard,"nah, they’re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in cedar-sinai for a week."
9409,Howard,"maybe i could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students."
8016,Howard,there you are.
7679,Howard,jews don’t have hell. we have acid reflux.
11754,Howard,"oh, gosh, how much time do you have?"
8874,Howard,uh-huh.
11963,Howard,you’re right. i suppose that could be considered offensive.
21715,Howard,i haven’t seen your oreos! just take your bath without them! 
6764,Howard,a veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. see the blonde over there? i can hit on her and you can’t.
7235,Howard,she’s not going to see it. she takes my temperature orally now.
11669,Howard,oh. how’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
10922,Howard,"huh. okay, i’ll try it."
10433,Howard,are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
10968,Howard,"oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. wil, want to go to star wars thursday?"
11126,Howard,"we can’t. it says on their web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with."
6485,Howard,"i’m fine, thanks for asking. i’ve come to call on missy. "
8330,Howard,"sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. i’m not taking you home."
10975,Howard,he’s right.
7196,Howard,shh! elevator shaft.
6708,Howard,"you know what? if it’s creepy to use the internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that i can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, i’m creepy."
9691,Howard,sheldon?
8974,Howard,no. my mom already tried that. it only made things worse.
10709,Howard,"what happened to me? when did i become an old man baffled by modern technology? next thing you know, i’ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to."
11492,Howard,"okay, raj, i’m gonna show you something. now, one of us thinks it’s offensive, the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea. but, i’m not going to tell you who likes it."
9269,Howard,done?
11653,Howard,"and with all these new skills, you’d be able to fix any model train. you’d be the king of the train store."
7157,Howard,"well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn’t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off."
8834,Howard,"all right, well, could you at least give her a message?"
7921,Howard,"hey, i’ve got a girlfriend now."
9206,Howard,"i had no idea how much that spot meant to you. anyway, i called president siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and i’ll park in the structure across the street."
7957,Howard,"you know, if we miss it, we’ll have the fun of listening to sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives."
10878,Howard,why are you still here?
9911,Howard,i had a little to do with it.
11722,Howard,i’ll say it again. india.
7060,Howard,were you in the original trilogy?
10700,Howard,"it’s not about the money. it’s about solving a problem. it’s why i became an engineer. it’s what i like to do, it’s what i’m trained to do. it’s who i am."
7860,Howard,"okay, what if he buys his own desk?"
9122,Howard,can’t we talk about this?
6866,Howard,you want the valley of fire? it’s right here.
11856,Howard,"i mean, not me, i’ve got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on instagram."
10080,Howard,"oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her."
11062,Howard,how can it be fine? i just got attacked by a clearly anti-semitic wild animal.
8735,Howard,hindus do the same thing. except they leave room for a cow.
9016,Howard,one to beam aboard?
9217,Howard,"so, how have you been?"
9497,Howard,the key to her heart. that’s nice. were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?
9584,Howard,awful. i had to rub her ointment all over her again.
6938,Howard,"well, hold on. are you saying if i don’t go to the wedding, i can’t go to geneva?"
8858,Howard,"well, too bad, you already did. it’s a done deal. oh, well. but i forgive you."
11573,Howard,"yeah, got to get her hooked on tv or someday she’ll want me to play outside. boy, that floor is so squeaky. i’m surprised i didn’t wake her up walking out of the room."
11337,Howard,"hey, marty. thanks for talking to us."
8699,Howard,"oh, wow, where do i even start? i got to experience zero gravity."
9333,Howard,what are you talking about? we make plenty of money.
11076,Howard,"are we in a good school district? you’re catholic, i’m jewish. what religion do we raise it? and if it’s a boy, do we get him circumcised? people say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t, it looks like a pig in a blanket."
6860,Howard,it’s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad jew.
6747,Howard,"so, anyway, lisa, i just wanted to tell you again how much i enjoyed the other night, and again, i’m sorry for how it ended. but again, if you could let me know about friday. my mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get."
8344,Howard,"if you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely."
6329,Howard,i don’t know.
10503,Howard,it wasn’t that bad.
9517,Howard,nice.
9582,Howard,"you’re kidding, right? i mean, you know i’m trying to lose weight. god, i thought we were partners in this marriage."
7947,Howard,not really.
6225,Howard,"hang on, honey. shiva and ganesh? the hindu gods against the entire union army?"
10666,Howard,you want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? that’s ridiculous.
7576,Howard,"so, what did you end up doing?"
10306,Howard,"for your information, i just bought the last one i needed on ebay."
8151,Howard,this is perfect. i hope this moment never ends.
6576,Howard,"for god’s sake, ma, i’m 27 years old. it’s not even a school night!  comfy now?"
6509,Howard,"so, listen, the new art is showing the revised definitive cut of blade runner."
9542,Howard,"fine.  you’d think, after all these years, i’d know not to fly over volcanoes. i’m a freaking idiot."
11590,Howard,i thought things were going well. what happened?
7051,Howard,depends. are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?
6843,Howard,"c’mon, don’t let him get to you. it’s kripke."
6889,Howard,i can’t believe you’re bringing that up.
8364,Howard,i’ve been up all night. i had a fight with bernadette.
9213,Howard,not me. i’m having dinner with bernadette and her parents.
10034,Howard,"like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, i don’t say anything?"
10633,Howard,"i’m surprised you could hear me with this thin mint in your ear. yeah, pretty cool, huh?"
9908,Howard,"well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos."
8434,Howard,great. we spent five hours last night at macy’s registering for gifts. looks like i’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish i’ve always wanted.
8782,Howard,i’ll give your paper to professor hawking.
7508,Howard,but i now realize how foolish that is.
6456,Howard,"i know, i’m disgusting, i should be punished. by her, oh look, i did it again. "
10143,Howard,"okay, let’s go."
6431,Howard,"oh, that’s cool."
10184,Howard,"oh, come on. you might’ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists."
8450,Howard,"she says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”"
11292,Howard,yeah. i do. it’s proof of concept. we’ve got a workable guidance system.
8561,Howard,"oh, yeah. now he’s gonna miss all those great updates like, i can’t believe i waited this long to make my own potpourri."
7694,Howard,you might want to stand back. i’m sitting on top of 13 horses here.
7526,Howard,good job not making fun of her.
7682,Howard,"yeah, since when do you take walks?"
7330,Howard,"oh, wow. you didn’t, did you?"
8708,Howard,"i ate a butterfly. it was so small and beautiful, but i was so hungry."
8915,Howard,what happens on the tenth time?
8057,Howard,"no, we can still make this work. leonard, you talk to penny."
9319,Howard,"do you realize, by owning a 3-d printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in china?"
10686,Howard,"sheldon, i have a master’s degree in engineering. i wipe my bottom with warranties. except for applecare. that pays for itself in the long run."
11639,Howard,i can’t believe we have to ask sheldon to come back and help us.
6306,Howard,"the monster truck is out of austin, texas, and the blue viper is being operated from suburban tel aviv. "
10345,Howard,"oh, so now you’re cheating on my mother?"
8658,Howard,"how about florida? they’ve got cape canaveral, they’ve got disney, they’ve got my aunt ida and the world’s largest collection of diabetic candy. plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride."
9505,Howard,"okay, so what do i need to know to take care of her?"
11982,Howard,can i help you?
9088,Howard,what are you waiting for? hit send.
6286,Howard,let’s not forget it’s got some really catchy tunes.
8453,Howard,you really want to ask her that?
9773,Howard,no. but i did get tackled in the hallway once. the whole school cheered.
9322,Howard,"okay, give me a superhero pose, and i will scan you into the computer for your action figure."
11928,Howard,"what’s up, my nerdizzles? raj, sheldon, i want you to meet my girlfriend bernadette."
7130,Howard,"easy. instead of saying, no, we don’t want to go on an nsf expedition, say, no, we don’t want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the arctic circle with an anal nutbag.”"
9682,Howard,thanks for getting me in trouble.
11044,Howard,you’ve been talking about breaking up with emily forever. why don’t you just do it already?
9225,Howard,took the words right out of my mouth.
9361,Howard,you’re still at my mother’s?
7352,Howard,i brought you a little gift. new kite.
7394,Howard,"okay, the best i can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation."
7762,Howard,"ah, there you have it, gentlemen. our entire dinner unpacked by robot."
9708,Howard,"ever since i met you, you turned my world around. you supported all my dreams and all my hopes. you’re like uranium-235 and i’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. i couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that i met you bernadette."
7053,Howard,"wait, is this your card or isn’t it? trust me, this was their card."
8477,Howard,"thanks for dinner, buddy."
11863,Howard,guys. focus. should we do something about nowitzki?
9752,Howard,i believe this is yours.
8484,Howard,"i hope not too tired, because i’m feeling particularly masculine right now. all systems go, if you catch my drift."
7493,Howard,"uh, what do you mean?"
11732,Howard,you should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with penny you don’t want to.
11966,Howard,"baruch atah, adonai, eloheinu. melech haolam, hamotzi. lechem min haaretz"
10231,Howard,"well, maybe i’ll do a good job."
11967,Howard,dr. schneider?
9519,Howard,cinnamon!
6867,Howard,what is it?
6975,Howard,"so here’s my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where i could ask you out and you’d say yes?"
7390,Howard,"hang on, how about now?"
9715,Howard,not his testosterone levels.
7502,Howard,"come on, do i have to think of everything?"
8351,Howard,"hey, what’s up?"
9626,Howard,"riddle me this. arrah, arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. he multiplies n by the number of he, and in this room the thing you’ll see."
6611,Howard,"oh, i’d so do her."
8431,Howard,i don’t need any butter.
10668,Howard,he was dressed as princess leia. it made a nice picture.
8387,Howard,"well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with kama sutra coloring books."
10328,Howard,yes.
6586,Howard,hello.
7555,Howard,"oh, that’s perfect. bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating."
9104,Howard,and i will.
10016,Howard,"well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of temple beth el. anyway, she broke up with him. and she’s basically been alone ever since. she never said it, but i always felt i was the reason why."
6177,Howard,turn left on lake street and head up to colorado. i know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
7604,Howard,they were closing up. we got this whole box for sixty bucks.
7961,Howard,knock-knock.
11379,Howard,we’ve hit a bit of a snag. we’re already behind schedule.
8863,Howard,"mr. rostenkowski, are you busy?"
9801,Howard,how do you know i didn’t do them?
6874,Howard,maybe we should have your head notarized.
11061,Howard,"poor judgement, obviously."
7626,Howard,"okay, just so you know, if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe."
7404,Howard,i lost my virginity to my cousin jeanie.
9895,Howard,last night. drank my pepto straight out of the bottle.
11746,Howard,"speaking of which, for day care, it’ll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it."
7685,Howard,let’s go.
11353,Howard,"no, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and i broke it by saying okay."
6472,Howard,"okay, you two have to back off."
9899,Howard,"okay, you guys are such babies. i’ll handle this. if he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away."
9051,Howard,"i love you, too. i can’t tell you how many times i dreamed i was in bed here with you when i was… you know. what, i can’t even point?"
7179,Howard,"what’s there to learn? you get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. easy peasy."
11902,Howard,"hey, it’s me again. howard. listen, my cousins from fort lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we’re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant."
10648,Howard,"well, raj and i always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so i taught myself and i’m putting this on instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. say cheese."
10937,Howard,"that’s not the point. when we created footprints on the moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. you know, maybe i should go solo."
8956,Howard,i know.
9318,Howard,we don’t need malibu koothrappali’s dream house.
10744,Howard,i’m not saying anything bad. just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.
10481,Howard,"okay, who was he talking to, emily or cinnamon? i want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you’re not in it."
7603,Howard,"my guess is, “hey, four minutes! new record!” that’s why i’m the funny one."
10291,Howard,"oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies."
9450,Howard,what? us? who else knows?
11251,Howard,"actually, it’s making me dizzy."
9301,Howard,i’m with leonard. i’m done.
6253,Howard,"hey, have you seen koothrapali?"
7490,Howard,then get the regular!
10132,Howard,"oh, come on, give her a chance."
8642,Howard,did it work?
9594,Howard,"okay, well, i’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, i need you to be honest with me. do my boobs look bigger to you?"
6190,Howard,"how about liquid coolant? maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch pvc…"
8408,Howard,"wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues."
8460,Howard,"i speak sign language, i don’t read minds."
6297,Howard,"oh, yeah, i tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card. "
7688,Howard,"so what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?"
9182,Howard,are you listening to yourself?
11558,Howard,"i mean, it’s stuart. maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away."
8415,Howard,see? she’s good with it.
8798,Howard,"oh, come on, the man torments me. i’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine."
9494,Howard,"oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? listen to me, if she’s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. rig the game."
10776,Howard,"okay, calm down. there’s a theme to this weekend. we are going to mexico in feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house feynman bought with the money from his nobel prize."
6679,Howard,"what do you mean, aw? like she didn’t know we were nerds?"
6350,Howard,"one more thing. this is a subsonic impact sensor. if sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. at that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick sheldon, you’ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses."
9962,Howard,hey.
9866,Howard,that’s how you reject a guy.
10675,Howard,maybe we should recalibrate it.
10972,Howard,check. wait. screw it. i’m holding it.
8110,Howard,"what, i’m not hot enough for angelina jolie?"
6842,Howard,even twenty thousand of ’em.
10254,Howard,yeah.
10821,Howard,"raj, wait."
8146,Howard,you lucky duck.
9464,Howard,yeah. i’m terrific.
9787,Howard,i am cleaning up. look at the mess the joker made of gotham city.
10189,Howard,i am.
10145,Howard,why?
9236,Howard,ew!
11786,Howard,"i told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out."
11903,Howard,"we’re not going to the olive garden, mom!"
6719,Howard,i got the mars rover stuck in a ditch.
7244,Howard,"yeah, i think i covered that."
9771,Howard,really? that dumb-ass she used to date? that’s hysterical.
7498,Howard,"i was in bed with bernadette, and you text-blocked me."
9184,Howard,give it back.
8764,Howard,"oh, you can’t be serious."
11823,Howard,i can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.
9618,Howard,have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?
10605,Howard,"don’t listen to her. you and i go way back, we’re like brothers."
9589,Howard,fine. i’ll wear gloves next time.
9604,Howard,stop it.
8925,Howard,you’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.
9116,Howard,"oh, i’m fine. it’s just her i’m worried about."
9714,Howard,you know they’re making jewellery right?
8058,Howard,"you got her to have sex with you. obviously, your superpower is brainwashing."
10672,Howard,nice. where were you when i was single?
9819,Howard,i’ve never done this before. it’s kind of fun.
10979,Howard,"well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? then you’ll get to talk to her."
7683,Howard,hold on. i’ll walk down with you.
7161,Howard,"if i may abruptly change the subject, did you and penny finally… you know."
6827,Howard,grossman.
6377,Howard,the only thing we need to do is make this kim kid lose his focus.
10956,Howard,"could you imagine? what a cool way for us to meet. he’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band."
8620,Howard,"oh, yeah."
11358,Howard,let’s find out.
7414,Howard,"you don’t need forks. it’s so tender, it falls apart in your hands."
9127,Howard,we should figure out where he goes.
11355,Howard,you are a deeply silly man.
6199,Howard,"sheldon, he’s got raj, use your sleath spell. sheldon! sheldon!"
10513,Howard,that would be great. i’d love for things between me and mom to get back to normal.
11395,Howard,call you back.
11108,Howard,you have any idea what you’re getting sheldon for his birthday?
6204,Howard,"kissing, what kind of kissing? cheeks? lips? chaste? french? "
10442,Howard,no. i need to do it. this is on me.
9482,Howard,what?
7731,Howard,there it is. there’s the spike!
7670,Howard,"hey, i just wanted to tell you i’m a big fan."
7827,Howard,the highlight of the evening was when you showed us your bollywood break dancing skills. 
11759,Howard,"hey, how’s it going?"
8179,Howard,"hey, bernadette, can i talk to you for a second?"
10392,Howard,that’s intense.
10358,Howard,"damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?"
9198,Howard,get out of my spot.
9468,Howard,"we thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong."
9066,Howard,"great, now i’m in trouble. you happy?"
8334,Howard,jews have been asking that for centuries. there’s no real good answer.
6272,Howard,anything you want.
9581,Howard,hey.
10078,Howard,and the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.
10754,Howard,"you think it’s hard having one wife, try having two."
11996,Howard,wondering how it all began?
6955,Howard,that’s it.
10718,Howard,she doesn’t baby me.
11388,Howard,"so you know the sex of our baby, and we don’t?"
11912,Howard,"you’re right, that’s a great idea."
11850,Howard,"well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the fda shut down your project?"
11306,Howard,"oh, god. i think someone’s following us."
7663,Howard,"what’d you do, romeo? you pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?"
11264,Howard,"well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems."
11539,Howard,"thank god you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today."
7528,Howard,"well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. leonard?"
9448,Howard,what?
9516,Howard,"good thinking.  cinnamon, come to daddy."
8349,Howard,what?
9926,Howard,that was nasa. they want me to go back up to the space station.
11481,Howard,"and he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it."
6498,Howard,"well, raj got him an awesome limited edition dark knight sculpture based on alex ross’s definitive batman, and i got him this amazing autographed copy of the feynman lectures on physics."
7200,Howard,"all right, sheldon, here we go, kleingast’s field guide to north american insects. hey, toby. right here, see it? the common field cricket, aka gryllus assimilis, which is latin for suck it, you lose."
11255,Howard,"oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. and, and, and, and, and here we are."
8096,Howard,"that green bag is dr. cooper’s. here’s an extra five. make him wait. oh. right to the nap, huh? okay? uh, so, this glenn guy. you say you went out with him for, like, a year."
11177,Howard,"did you get graham crackers? i mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?"
7227,Howard,"does it? okay, if you like space stuff, i design components for the international space station. which is in space. where, as i’m sure you know, no one can hear you scream."
7089,Howard,"no, i’m celebrating. as we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the international space station where it will deploy the wolowitz zero-gravity waste disposal system."
8932,Howard,they do. that’s why we marry them.
6417,Howard,"okay, we’re going to need a strong fourth for our team."
11831,Howard,what the hell?
11227,Howard,"wait, what is going on?"
10289,Howard,"hold on. pause. something doesn’t make sense. look, in 2015, biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. but as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that marty and doc were in."
7814,Howard,nice to see you.
21701,Howard,right.
11891,Howard,"mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do i got? thanks. i can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in israel. "
7887,Howard,"well, you know how it is with guys. i mean, we have needs and…"
9788,Howard,"raj grew up in india. trust me, he’s seen worse."
7384,Howard,"i’m busy too, you answer it."
11747,Howard,you okay?
8403,Howard,can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?
10293,Howard,"oh, i can’t argue with him. it’s right there on the screen. austria does look like a wiener."
6615,Howard,you were a colossal ass-hat.
11951,Howard,i’ll get it!
6323,Howard,wow.
11692,Howard,they complete my ensemble. what do you want?
11013,Howard,no.
10331,Howard,that’s fine. i don’t care.
11636,Howard,but we’ve already met the agreed upon specs. going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations. 
10905,Howard,maybe we did make the test too difficult.
6946,Howard,"okay, raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver."
6673,Howard,nekhmakh.
8038,Howard,i prefer to think that i can’t lose.
7930,Howard,how could you? we had a pact!
11092,Howard,"hey. in your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?"
6763,Howard,"uh, leonard, huge mistake. there’s a whole buffet of women out there and you’re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again."
7088,Howard,"they’re on me today, boys."
6993,Howard,and i’ll bet lesbians love bluetooth.
11138,Howard,what are you doing?
7443,Howard,so nice you could join me this evening. you’re looking lovely as always.
7750,Howard,four thirty.
7248,Howard,"okay, wait, how about this? we say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends."
8893,Howard,"really? well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand."
7474,Howard,no.
7142,Howard,what?
6435,Howard,why don’t we share it? we’ll each put in two hundred bucks and we’ll take turns having it in our homes.
10554,Howard,does she have any pillows or wine glasses?
8442,Howard,"raj says it’s nice to meet you, too. she says she has to go back to her family, but penny has her number if you want to text her and get together."
9759,Howard,sheldon.
8861,Howard,"no. i, uh, i should talk to him, man to man."
8405,Howard,"well, don’t think of it that way. once we move in, it’ll be our house."
10996,Howard,"as long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want."
7980,Howard,"ah, this takes me back. leonard obsessing about penny. i mean, don’t get me wrong, i love your new stuff, but once in a while it’s nice to hear the hits."
6226,Howard,what do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?
10611,Howard,six. seven. eight. nine. ten-five.
11347,Howard,"well, thanks, but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons."
8019,Howard,spiders! you’re afraid of spiders!
9806,Howard,i don’t want coffee.
10154,Howard,"ma, i hope you’re decent. raj is here. you just started seeing naked women again, and i don’t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be."
9924,Howard,"well, that’s the last time i play with that.  i have to take this. hello? 00:04:24,137"
10632,Howard,"hey, hey, the young man asked a good question."
7121,Howard,meatloaf.
11948,Howard,i wish to discuss your theories of black holes. meet me at the randy’s donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
8228,Howard,you’re right.
10294,Howard,like behavior modification?
11064,Howard,"it’s not terrific. lots of highly unlikely things happen. you saw what’s under this robe, and you still married me."
7348,Howard,"all i know about saks is, my mother shops there."
10495,Howard,"i don’t know, he’s not really hurting anybody."
8324,Howard,"what you’ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, i’ve been the whole world to my mother. i mean, she’d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can’t."
9414,Howard,nothing.
10489,Howard,"yes, we can."
8043,Howard,"no, i know bullying. he left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free."
7376,Howard,"but if she dumps you, she’ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you’ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. so the only question is, how long until you fold?"
10918,Howard,it’s not like i’m expecting them to sing.
8796,Howard,"hey, i gave you first crack at it."
8780,Howard,"yeah, i know, i’m just trying to figure out how much i want to punish him."
10218,Howard,"well, i was going to, but the day of tryouts i found my dad’s playboy collection. threw my arm out."
8032,Howard,"oh, for crying out loud. what kind of superhero needs a jacket?"
7058,Howard,"shut up. let’s just get koothrappali and go.  hello. i am sanjay wolowitz from bombay. okay, i’m stumped."
11554,Howard,"hey, i found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies."
8022,Howard,"oh, really? what if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?"
8967,Howard,"oh, it’s okay. space is beautiful. earth is beautiful. same old, same old."
9554,Howard,"i’m proud of you, leonard. working out on the north sea for months, that’s really something."
9981,Howard,fine.
9189,Howard,he wasn’t using it. and i needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
9765,Howard,he doesn’t want me in there. i’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.
10019,Howard,both great.
7237,Howard,"you know  hi ho, i’m on howard’s butt!"
11687,Howard,what? why? 
10572,Howard,all you said was i had to get rid of things. you didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first.
11988,Howard,"raj, who’s at the door?"
11547,Howard,of course.
6349,Howard,"it’s all right, wireless mini-cam and bluetooth headset. we’ll be your eyes. "
9917,Howard,he said it.
6549,Howard,"not now, i have a blog to find. "
9536,Howard,what do you do?
10563,Howard,"yes. it reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody’s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup."
6198,Howard,"leonard, you’ve got one on your tail."
6341,Howard,that’s a negatory. but there’s a planet of the apes marathon at the new art today. 
6772,Howard,i don’t know. kryptonian mustard.
8649,Howard,sorry. my phone.
10340,Howard,yep.
11926,Howard,testing. check. check two.
6831,Howard,you really think so?
10304,Howard,you didn’t have to say so much more.
10657,Howard,exactly what sheldon and howard said.
7610,Howard,"listen, i was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. no copyright notice on it. so, i took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world."
10382,Howard,"i love that i’m kind of a slob around here, and you’re okay with that."
6454,Howard,don’t think so. i followed her here from the parking lot. 
8437,Howard,"eat another pie, you’ll have your own bazongas."
11534,Howard,debbie? no. she hated that name.
8414,Howard,"sure she would. ma, do you mind if bernadette stays here this weekend?"
6307,Howard,that would be me. 
10834,Howard,my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.
7159,Howard,"actually, it was his idea."
9686,Howard,"guys, listen up. "
8688,Howard,it’s the 21st century. you can’t have a duel.
9341,Howard,not exactly. they spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
9827,Howard,"mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum."
11069,Howard,we? what is this?
6989,Howard,"it’s a common stripper problem. they dance, they sweat, they clump."
11743,Howard,"hey, what’s for dinner?"
7057,Howard,"don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt."
11665,Howard,"well, how much do you spend on food?"
9938,Howard,what’s going on?
9311,Howard,get that waste of money out of my face.
6825,Howard,"marcy grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it’s cold outside, marcy grossman is the month of may…"
7332,Howard,more wine?
8876,Howard,"oh, i am. and just so you know, i’d still be an astronaut, even if i didn’t go to space. i’ve got an i.d. card and a nasa golf shirt."
10927,Howard,"oh, man. i, what an honour to meet you. i’m, i’m such a fan of tesla and spacex. all your companies. howard wolowitz, caltech."
10561,Howard,thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff.
6411,Howard,"alright, that’s it."
11020,Howard,"i’m just saying, instead of let it go, she should really sing, look at me hiding in a freezer like a dove bar."
11080,Howard,i shouldn’t be raising a kid. i don’t even eat my own vegetables.
7748,Howard,sheldon. hey.
7804,Howard,i know!  then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.
11417,Howard,stuart. he heard me talking about us going away. i guess he decided to invite himself over?
9913,Howard,i love you so much.
7475,Howard,"could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?"
10104,Howard,you mean a forklift?
6170,Howard,it’s french for good shower. it’s a sentiment i can express in six languages.
11543,Howard,"tired, but great. they’re both great."
7109,Howard,"okay, here’s an idea. what if i change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband avi in israel?"
10033,Howard,i spoke to bernadette. she’s free tomorrow night.
11079,Howard,"i’m, uh, uh, gonna be a father."
10932,Howard,thank you.
10391,Howard,"don’t feel bad. someday someone will be throwing out your work, too."
11413,Howard,"what are we gonna do, e-mail 911?"
7122,Howard,that’s classified.
7487,Howard,please? i got a real hankering.
21710,Howard,i don’t have playdates! i have colleagues!
9320,Howard,"eh, what can you do?"
9683,Howard,pull.
7869,Howard,"okay. well, you know world of warcraft?"
6813,Howard,i don’t want to talk to anybody.
9197,Howard,"i’m warning you, sheldon!"
10950,Howard,"uh, did you forget? we’re in a band."
10420,Howard,it’s all i could find. it’ll work.
10640,Howard,"yeah. well, i like music, i like science, i like making fun of sheldon. hit it."
9349,Howard,hey. how’d it go last night with my mom?
9390,Howard,"oh, you’re kidding. let me see. well, i’ll be. look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf."
10059,Howard,i’m just saying…
10551,Howard,raj was snooping through emily’s drawers and broke one.
8506,Howard,"i was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back."
9805,Howard,"no, you’re being a better husband than i am. doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?"
6648,Howard,"the application in your hand, give it to her."
10534,Howard,"so, some stranger has my mom? is that what you’re telling me? my poor mother can be anywhere in los angeles right now?"
8655,Howard,i haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day leonard made that multiplication error.
8898,Howard,they invented blintzes. i’ll be fine.
7257,Howard,"yeah. hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night."
8362,Howard,"oh, bernie, no. you didn’t have to."
7553,Howard,how long has he been stuck?
11536,Howard,ah. it sucks that she’s not here.
11090,Howard,"i don’t know, all apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them."
7452,Howard,"don’t remind me!  oh, man. all soaped up and no place to go."
6704,Howard,"no need to neuter the nerd, i can get you back online."
6916,Howard,can i assume that you likewise found the experience…
7113,Howard,where are you going?
8426,Howard,"morning, mom."
11378,Howard,"when the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that."
6463,Howard,"come on, shelly, she’s family."
10083,Howard,i’m having sex with a catholic schoolgirl tonight.
6528,Howard,we can’t go home. 
11318,Howard,"yes, hello. uh, this is howard wolowitz for colonel richard williams."
11078,Howard,"yeah, um, in a minute. i actually need to tell you guys something."
7754,Howard,"well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?"
10840,Howard,sounds like you on cinco de mayo.
11847,Howard,ooh. sounds serious. have i been a bad boy? am i gonna get a spanking ’cause you know.
7415,Howard,maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?
7612,Howard,just a guy. i know a guy.
8790,Howard,"sheldon, these look great. they’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. how’d you get them so shiny?"
9151,Howard,what?
7622,Howard,"clearly, you’ve never been to my house for dinner on rosh hashanah."
11351,Howard,i love your french toast.
6800,Howard,"gentlemen, goggles."
8995,Howard,"i missed you, too. where are the guys?"
11509,Howard,how did you know it wasn’t me?
8729,Howard,"that’s my ride, got to go. "
9580,Howard,i’ve put on a couple pounds. had to buy these pants in the men’s section.
11907,Howard,"ooh, looks like i’m gonna have sex tonight. hey, baby…"
6872,Howard,"come on, leonard, let’s go"
6714,Howard,"mock me if you will, but it works. you show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs."
6701,Howard,"look, on the roof, anais and giselle are sunbathing. european-style."
8611,Howard,no.
11344,Howard,"it’s a group effort, but i guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me."
10273,Howard,no one wants to hear it.
9146,Howard,it’s locked.
9154,Howard,are we good?
9528,Howard,isn’t every conversation you two have awkward?
8875,Howard,"right, right."
8949,Howard,"stop it, ma. i’m sure i can get bernie to come around."
6321,Howard,"wait a minute, farminfarmian is speaking and you’re bogarding the symposium. "
9447,Howard,i am.
8576,Howard,yeah. i started when i was a teenager. i thought i could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.
7905,Howard,"no, you don’t. it’s me. the lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants."
7488,Howard,"thanks, ma."
8904,Howard,"i got this. excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? see, i’m an astronaut and i’m leaving for russia on sunday so i can take a soyuz rocket to the international space station."
6335,Howard,chocolate milk and eggoes please! 
6405,Howard,"how about the perpetual motion squad? it’s beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies. "
7156,Howard,"that’s why i added the tator. and then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy."
11943,Howard,fine.  red five to red leader. what do you want now?
8474,Howard,"she says, sure, what about him?"
10377,Howard,not important.
7759,Howard,"good god, what have we done?"
11668,Howard,wait. why are we talking about our place when sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty?
11284,Howard,"hmm, maybe not. leonard?"
10017,Howard,all i’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.
7085,Howard,"she’s a hooker, isn’t she."
9729,Howard,"okay, who’s up first?"
8183,Howard,"no, wait. you didn’t let me finish."
9695,Howard,"seriously, congratulations, sheldon."
8271,Howard,"this one’s funny, leonard. how come you couldn’t make it work with her?"
11657,Howard,"yeah, we’re seeing if raj can hold his breath longer than it."
8078,Howard,eureka!
6322,Howard,"no, no, you’re quark-blocking us. "
9342,Howard,"anyway, it was bernie’s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation."
6792,Howard,"excuse me, we’re ready."
8390,Howard,"what? you’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. this is your answer. there are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. you have one, priya has one in india. when you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. see? internet kissing.  give it a try."
8155,Howard,"oh, honey, i’m sorry. what can i do?"
9290,Howard,so what’s our first pose going to be?
11182,Howard,what the hell are you watching?
9438,Howard,"yeah, i just couldn’t sleep."
6521,Howard,"no, listen, see we’re throwing my friend a surprise party and i’m supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours."
11787,Howard,"great, now everybody’s crying."
11970,Howard,okay. okay. okay. okay. okay! okay.
8143,Howard,what’s going on?
10913,Howard,i happen to be a giving and generous lover.
7845,Howard,"no, ma!"
9219,Howard,i’m sensing a theme. you ever really think about the spider-man theme song? how’s that dinner coming?
9661,Howard,"yeah, i know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. bipolar bear."
6178,Howard,but does it have peanut oil?
8832,Howard,i’m not calling the girl from comic-con.
10483,Howard,what do you mean?
6506,Howard,no problem.
9722,Howard,"oh, that’s actually pretty nice."
11114,Howard,"okay, then, uh, sheldon, we’ve known each other a long time. and it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend."
9280,Howard,i don’t know. seek professional help?
11864,Howard,she’s not that kind of doctor.
10186,Howard,hey.
11848,Howard,oh.
7602,Howard,sweet.
11106,Howard,"i’d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. i love you, bernie.  havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ how much you love me. havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ what you’re thinkin’ of me."
10485,Howard,"okay, we’ll do it."
8672,Howard,"we’re grown men, we drink at bars."
9720,Howard,nope. bernadette told me it isn’t nice and i’m not allowed.
7154,Howard,he’s speaking about it.
7662,Howard,"oh, but something happened."
11277,Howard,let’s do it.
11624,Howard,"please. when you see the ring i pick out, you’re gonna melt."
7923,Howard,"okay, forget who’s hotter. the first time priya came to la, leonard and i made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her."
6832,Howard,i don’t know.
7693,Howard,"all right, have a nice walk."
8818,Howard,"okay, buddy, that’s it. sit down."
11505,Howard,"this is very nice stuart, thank you."
10928,Howard,"oh, yeah. nothing better than helping people. which is something i realized when i was viewing earth from the deck of the international space station, where i spent two months as a payload specialist, a job i was qualified for because i’m an mit-trained engineer."
11899,Howard,"hello, boys."
7242,Howard,"aaaaaargh! okay, that’s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo."
6444,Howard,"lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers."
8936,Howard,"i’m amazing. i mean, this is even better than i dreamed. i look out the window, and it’s all so unbelievable."
8276,Howard,sure.
9508,Howard,it was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
10474,Howard,like am i dressed okay?
8185,Howard,i choose you.
11977,Howard,"all i do is win, win, win no matter what."
11496,Howard,you laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.
11756,Howard,and i forgot to give her the message.
7283,Howard,top o’ the mornin’o ya!
7597,Howard,"plus, you didn’t get to meet stan lee."
8249,Howard,our troll just walked in! i got him!
7189,Howard,"no, no, not this time. i know insects, my friend, i spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. in latin."
10773,Howard,yeah. a buddy of mine let me borrow it.
7697,Howard,"see you, buddy."
9253,Howard,"so, what do we do now? they expect us to go away for the weekend."
11405,Howard,how ’bout we stay here? we don’t even have to tell anyone. it’ll be like a secret vacation at home. 
10558,Howard,we should hang up.
9352,Howard,you wore my pyjamas?
10170,Howard,"yeah, in my house."
8626,Howard,yes. his phone.
11631,Howard,i know. that’s why i keep refilling his water when he’s not looking.
7523,Howard,"yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and leonard. these broncos have been saddled."
9223,Howard,had no idea you were the chatty one.
7366,Howard,"ah, who am i kidding? i wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that."
10045,Howard,that must be it.
10418,Howard,"great, we’re turning on each other. that’s just what the bird wants us to do."
10177,Howard,"hey, what if i took your class?"
6291,Howard,"fine, next time make your own date."
7664,Howard,did you ask her to start waxing?
11556,Howard,what’s the matter?
11800,Howard,"then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about tiggers button."
11463,Howard,i’ll take that as a yes. she’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed.
11389,Howard,it’s unbelievable.
11427,Howard,i felt a kick. there’s a baby in there.
7942,Howard,you?
8751,Howard,"so, i got the craziest e-mail this morning."
7536,Howard,"hey, i once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens."
7062,Howard,"so, where were we?"
10835,Howard,i thought you were puss in boots.
6289,Howard,just give it to me. 
7729,Howard,happy now? i’m moving the dirty sock.
11212,Howard,but batman is a man. you’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. that’s just man-man.
10872,Howard,why wouldn’t i want to hear it?
9685,Howard,"wait, maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first."
7928,Howard,didn’t see it? what were you doing?
7846,Howard,"maybe it committed suicide! leave me alone! now, where were we?"
7902,Howard,"short jokes? really? you’re, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me."
9646,Howard,damn. how’d you swing that?
7465,Howard,"i hope it’s all right, i told my girlfriend bernadette she could join us for dinner."
11447,Howard,aaaaah. what was i thinking? wolowitzes are not a lifting people. we tip the lifting people.
7145,Howard,"good idea, what do you think? ice station zebra or john carpenter’s the thing?"
9378,Howard,i said i’m sorry.
7747,Howard,"well, him about to find out about her."
7481,Howard,"i hope not, because you don’t want to mess with me. i’m crazy."
9950,Howard,check my blood pressure again. i can get it higher. just give me a second.  
6715,Howard,"a neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “normally, i’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” i’ve got a whole list of ’em. who wants to be my wingman?"
9141,Howard,what the hell is he up to?
6318,Howard,"uh-oh, here comes “the talk.” "
6814,Howard,i don’t have homework. i’m a grown man with a master’s degree in engineering!
11578,Howard,"mit’s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager."
9854,Howard,you’re both into rock?
11365,Howard,"if you’re tired, have some coffee."
10494,Howard,"that was the last one, i promise. we won’t play any more."
6961,Howard,"no, no, no, that always creeps girls out. i need to come up with something that’s funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature."
10047,Howard,"it was the most incredible experience of my life. up there in the space station, you’re…"
11117,Howard,is the impression that your first name is pee-wee?
7256,Howard,"true. okay, forget the hot tub. the point is, we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls."
7517,Howard,"her name is bernadette, she’s working as a waitress, but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist."
7751,Howard,what?
7658,Howard,"okay, forget giant ants. how about giant rabbits?"
7048,Howard,"possible, very possible. do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?"
10275,Howard,"and a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up."
8433,Howard,"i say, hey ma, what’s for dinner?”"
6192,Howard,"perfect, leonard, why don’t you and sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, raj and i will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch."
11774,Howard,stop looking at that. the day care’s great. it’s on campus. my office is two minutes away. there’s nothing to worry about.
11877,Howard,we can’t get to the phone right now because we’re having sex.
10613,Howard,"don’t listen to her, just hit the ball."
10907,Howard,no. how does it work?
10044,Howard,"well, you sure don’t. you i know, you i know, you? total stranger. even if you had yummy candy, i would not get in your van."
8372,Howard,i’m sorry. what?
8627,Howard,uh-huh.
10109,Howard,not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.
6985,Howard,hold on. what are you using as a bonding agent?
10612,Howard,"it was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over."
7380,Howard,i said i’m sorry.
9624,Howard,find something you like.
10915,Howard,wipe that smug smile off your face.
10567,Howard,"oh, my god."
11400,Howard,"well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
9937,Howard,"hey, bernie. i’m home. hello."
11506,Howard,"hang on, maybe it’s not the worst idea. i mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother."
7019,Howard,"if i may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, thursday night is ladies’ night. which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one jell-o shots."
9701,Howard,"guys, there was an accident at bernie’s lab."
8641,Howard,like how?
11964,Howard,"oh, hi."
7892,Howard,yeah.
12001,Howard,"i feel for ya. i’ve got a psychotic mommy, too."
10681,Howard,it means the calibration failed. we have to start over.
9212,Howard,it’s heebie-jeebies.
8156,Howard,"okay. like, what, another five, ten minutes?"
8378,Howard,what are you going to do in nebraska?
9939,Howard,"um, okay. i know my mom’s not dead, there’d be balloons."
6555,Howard,"for god’s sake, sheldon, if you don’t like the tangerine chicken, don’t order the tangerine chicken."
11323,Howard,why do i bother talking to you?
10112,Howard,it’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.
9769,Howard,"you know, my mom’s been to arizona. she rode one of those mules down in the grand canyon. long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘cause she’s so fat. i’ll get the door while you finish laughing. hey, guys."
7215,Howard,"oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?"
10703,Howard,ha-ha.
10705,Howard,gps?
6774,Howard,"okay, he’s invited for dinner in the bottle city of kandor. he miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. now, before dinner, his host says, “who’s up for a little kryptonian tetherball?” superman says “sure,” works up a sweat, comes back to earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible kryptonian perspiration."
11433,Howard,"oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby."
6409,Howard,don’t you think i should answer the engineering questions? i am an engineer.
10096,Howard,"boy, some of the physical comedy with jar jar is a little tough to watch."
7737,Howard,"yeah, right."
8524,Howard,"hey, sheldon."
7114,Howard,"hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space."
10386,Howard,we’re just saying all the things we love about each other.
7897,Howard,"yeah, we had a really great talk, and we’re gonna start seeing each other again."
8199,Howard,"what? it’s fun. if i have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat."
8094,Howard,please tell me he’s your gay cousin.
6469,Howard,you still have to wear a helmet. 
8572,Howard,how is this lying?
7112,Howard,because this is not a spare part from the space station. this is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
10313,Howard,do the dishes. there’s a star right there.
9012,Howard,who is that?
11250,Howard,okay. everything’s hooked up. we’re ready.
6855,Howard,you gotta give him credit for sticking with it.
6766,Howard,she was?
6519,Howard,"oh god, oh god, oh god, oh….  okay sheldon, what was it supposed to be? fine, it’s out of the washer. i’ll call you when it’s in the dryer. "
8987,Howard,"okay, okay. what am i doing? i’m using up all the oxygen. if i die, promise you’ll never have sex with another man."
8192,Howard,a little snack. you got any string cheese?
7407,Howard,anything?
11629,Howard,yeah. it doesn’t need to be smaller. 
9829,Howard,i lived with her to save money.
9350,Howard,what time did you leave?
11404,Howard,i’m sorry. we don’t have to go.
11266,Howard,"yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons."
8457,Howard,"it’s a funny story about a puppy. just smile and laugh. quick, quick, stop smiling."
7202,Howard,shiksa. shik-sa.
6836,Howard,"well, don’t get the wrong idea. the way i see it, i’m halfway to pity sex."
8976,Howard,what’s wrong? you look upset.
9724,Howard,be right back.
9754,Howard,"well, if i may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to youtube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride."
6912,Howard,"oh, yeah, sorry about that."
11581,Howard,is that supposed to be funny?
11246,Howard,‘cause we’re not in it for the stuff. we’re in it for the groupies.
11609,Howard,"uh, basically, she traded you for bruce wayne."
8765,Howard,hang on. are you saying the rest of us are dogs?
11574,Howard,"well, i put the rug down. it didn’t help."
11385,Howard,bloberta. or blobbi with an i.
9050,Howard,"okay, no problem. it won’t happen again."
9817,Howard,"oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once."
9221,Howard,death by chicken. that’s a pretty fowl way to go.
8778,Howard,you walk away.
10167,Howard,"well, i didn’t say i was your father."
11771,Howard,"should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo? oh, howie, i don’t need food as long as i can look at my phone."
11846,Howard,i missed you.
9815,Howard,are you kidding? you’re the best. i know what the problem is. it’s him.
11867,Howard,you done trying to make yourself feel better?
9094,Howard,"you know, it’s kinda late. why don’t we just spend the night here?"
7599,Howard,he said we could call him stan.
10251,Howard,"toy stores, puppet shows."
9810,Howard,"what are you talking about? remember last week, when i asked you if you were wearing spanx and you weren’t? how’s that different?"
7377,Howard,"come on. at the very least, when she found out leonard was upset about it, she should’ve backed off."
6604,Howard,i do that too. but probably in a different way.
7571,Howard,"i understand your point, but given a choice, jews always go with chinese food."
10890,Howard,"if you don’t want to use dating web sites, what do you suggest?"
9760,Howard,"oh, her gout’s flaring up. turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away."
11500,Howard,what do you think?
6383,Howard,smooth.
10757,Howard,doesn’t matter. what are you mad about?
7350,Howard,"i mean, quidditch, sure. but football?"
7098,Howard,no. are you crazy?what am i gonna say? i screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there’s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?
7341,Howard,hold my line.
9648,Howard,you sound kind of proud of it.
6246,Howard,i’m peter pan! and i’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. 
8848,Howard,let me explain the difference between you and me. you watch star trek. i live it.
10743,Howard,"well, that’s understandable. you forgot. it’s called happy."
7163,Howard,what are you doing?
11841,Howard,"oh. yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world. "
6786,Howard,"gather round, kids, it’s time for sheldon’s beloved christmas special."
6388,Howard,"no, i have allergies. "
8706,Howard,"no. i slept in a hole i dug in the ground with my bare hands. and at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me."
8289,Howard,fine.
10545,Howard,"she doesn’t have to, i filled up on jelly beans."
8723,Howard,"no. bernadette’s going to be playing with us. so, that’s pretty cool, huh? right? sure it is, yeah."
10765,Howard,then i won’t say i’d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.
11361,Howard,what?
10867,Howard,when is your visa up?
10469,Howard,"well, of course he believed in god. he slept with marilyn monroe."
11115,Howard,what? you gotta be kidding me?
8821,Howard,"thank you for picking us up. there’s a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. you cannot be operatin’ heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!"
7998,Howard,nope. he’s gone.
11795,Howard,"i’ll get her, you grab her bag. "
8835,Howard,"tell her i’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to marry me, i get it. but what i really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that i’m disgusted by, too. but that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the reason is because of her. so, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you."
7861,Howard,why?
9872,Howard,t-minus 60 seconds.
9637,Howard,"cherry, baby"
8279,Howard,"i know things haven’t been perfect with us, and we’ve had our problems, but i just have to tell you, from the moment i…"
11307,Howard,"i’m not being ridiculous, he’s right on my tail."
9275,Howard,what’s going on?
9277,Howard,huh. i just got called in to human resources.
6275,Howard,really?
10475,Howard,"i know you’re under a lot of pressure, so i’m gonna let that pass."
8166,Howard,that’s it. i don’t have to take this. good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
9203,Howard,what are you doing in there?
9864,Howard,arlene russel.
6415,Howard,"that sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your dalmatians. "
9818,Howard,that is not… he’s doing it again. 
7282,Howard,"fine, let’s watch it. maybe all our periods will synchronize."
10822,Howard,"indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora."
10048,Howard,can i finish my astronaut story?
8670,Howard,what are you doing here?
7769,Howard,"okay, here we go. passing the soy sauce. put out your hand."
6516,Howard,"i don’t know, it was just there."
8191,Howard,yeah. you know what would make this moment perfect?
9019,Howard,former dentist. i need a new one now that i know where his hands have been.
11298,Howard,"oh, please, that’s not how it works. you saw e.t., avatar, jurassic world. the military just shows up and takes over."
11810,Howard,"and it’s hard, isn’t it? so the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. hmm?"
7884,Howard,maybe later.
9007,Howard,"well, that was quick, and a little gross. now, i know how she feels."
8244,Howard,"whoever did this knew what they were doing. he got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn’t leave a digital fingerprint."
8784,Howard,are you familiar with the 12 labours of hercules?
6806,Howard,"the carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. but as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it’s still… hot."
6215,Howard,i smell robot. 
9763,Howard,i was gonna make raj do it all by himself.
7649,Howard,"well, no, you’re mistaken. you give speeches all the time. what you can’t do is shut up."
7642,Howard,something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.
11258,Howard,"no, two minutes."
7766,Howard,mostly with asian and jewish astronauts.
10095,Howard,obviously.
10752,Howard,i did.
8003,Howard,whoa. where did that come from?
9996,Howard,"oh, boy."
10070,Howard,"good idea. we can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to cinnamon, and then my mom can eat cinnamon. so what do you feel like doing?"
8395,Howard,why do you have to make everything weird?
11236,Howard,"yeah. cap’n crunch with crunch berries, move on."
10720,Howard,"you’re right. it’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. bernie, i made a mess."
7187,Howard,"oh, give me a frickin’ break. how could you possibly know that?"
9324,Howard,"all right, you can suck it in a little bit."
10882,Howard,i really believe i’d be a great dad.
9235,Howard,"come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this."
11436,Howard,"but it’s the safest crib you can buy. and if you don’t like it, we can return it."
6706,Howard,what are you complaining about? i’m the one who has to take the class again.
8258,Howard,and me.
9499,Howard,i don’t know. go with hockey.
21713,Howard,three. i designed the engine myself.
6182,Howard,get used to it.
11232,Howard,so what the hell happened?
6844,Howard,"that’s why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table."
9231,Howard,"you know, the thing."
11710,Howard,"i know it’s not ideal, but you’d have plenty of space for your furniture, and there’s this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down."
9640,Howard,because her life wasn’t enough?
10496,Howard,"hmm, it would. okay, back to emily or cinnamon? how can such a little girl eat such a big steak?"
8478,Howard,"it gets better. someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is."
6880,Howard,"so, she’s close to curing diabetes?"
11461,Howard,so you wouldn’t want to have anything on penny?
11709,Howard,"hey, uh, so we’ve been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we’d be happy to fix up the garage for you."
7023,Howard,"i’m a horny engineer, leonard. i never joke about math or sex."
10536,Howard,"no, i’m not leaving without her."
8643,Howard,that’s actually not a terrible plan.
8732,Howard,"anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck."
10780,Howard,"hey, i have to return this van. keep your creative juices in your pants."
7139,Howard,"doctor and mrs. koothrappali, namaste. i understand your concern, but if it’ll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until i was 17."
7614,Howard,"i know lots of dangerous people, okay?"
7908,Howard,what’s with the t-shirt? you working at the apple store now?
9674,Howard,you got the tropical fruit kind?
10056,Howard,"yeah, yeah, i get it."
9375,Howard,terrific. couldn’t be better.
11121,Howard,can you imagine if we make money with this?
11297,Howard,"am i? am i? what, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and i’m no longer in it? that chess club picture is now just david zimmerman and elaine cho."
6839,Howard,"oh, you’d think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey."
9974,Howard,how do i know what you said? damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
8937,Howard,"oh, yeah? that’s nice."
6545,Howard,well it’s not.
9742,Howard,"so, you can never take it off?"
8773,Howard,you’re kidding.
6920,Howard,"oh, great."
8088,Howard,"no, see, it’s not…"
7851,Howard,"no, of course not."
11373,Howard,you can’t develop a problem that fast.
11354,Howard,would you stop? we’re just gonna be on the other side of campus.
10355,Howard,yeah.
6999,Howard,you can’t be serious.
10674,Howard,"okay, the wifi extender is on, the camera’s on, they’re both on the same network. we should be getting an image."
11443,Howard,"uh, maybe it was more of a circle?"
9966,Howard,"anyway, i got invited to do a little talk at nasa in houston this weekend. they gave me two tickets. bernadette can’t go. you want to come with me? you can visit your mom, and i’ll show you around the space centre."
9885,Howard,"sheldon, just come with us. you’re not gonna make your own convention."
7406,Howard,"to this day, i can’t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. oh, cousin jeanie."
9486,Howard,keep reading. what does it say?
7822,Howard,you’re not doing that right.
9650,Howard,how about i take a bath with you and see what happens.
11920,Howard,"what’s going on, day dwellers?"
10165,Howard,"it is. he’s a grown man. he’s just gonna live there rent-free? how is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? i mean, do you even have a plan?"
11799,Howard,we can’t get through.
10649,Howard,you betcha. the very one.
10652,Howard,no. he is. so i have a dominant personality. we all know that.
7644,Howard,"yeah, so?"
7855,Howard,i did a stupid thing.
10487,Howard,"oh, maybe i am. who wouldn’t want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you’re so lucky, you have the shiniest hair."
10238,Howard,‘cause i’m an idiot who didn’t think this through.
9663,Howard,"okay, fine. i did say that, and i think it’s true. i think if we worked together and lived together, we’d get sick of each other."
11835,Howard,how can you work on something for a year and they just take it?
9739,Howard,you didn’t have to do that.
10276,Howard,you admit amy’s a distraction?
9483,Howard,cool. anything juicy?
10708,Howard,give me the number. probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who’s reading from the same manual i have. 
11880,Howard,"is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless. "
7164,Howard,"well, he’s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, i’m running away."
10077,Howard,"oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie."
8753,Howard,"he’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair."
11983,Howard,"all right, leonard, hang in there. talk to you tomorrow."
10151,Howard,"i mean, he calls her debbie, she calls him stewie and they’re all giggly around each other. and believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out."
8996,Howard,"oh, i get it. they’re waiting back home with a big surprise party. don’t worry, i can act surprised. "
10171,Howard,what a sick use of science.
9514,Howard,"yes, you were!."
9500,Howard,why don’t you put her in a kennel?
11664,Howard,you don’t need your dad’s money. you can get by on your salary.
10692,Howard,"it worked fine, it just wasn’t designed for russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet."
9602,Howard,"thank you. i really needed to hear that today.  ooh, brie’s ready."
8515,Howard,what do you say?
9707,Howard,"a candle without a wick, a watson without a crick, i’d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. i’d be cheese without the mac, jobs without the wozniak, i’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. i’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and i’d probably still live with my mom."
11913,Howard,"enough with the guilt, ma, we’ll still see each other. i’ll come over every night and have dinner with you."
9013,Howard,"if you’re busy, i can come back."
10603,Howard,"come on, raj. you are the king kong of ping-pong. you are the menace of table tennis. put her away, ’cause i don’t have a third one. yes. woo."
10480,Howard,"it’s called emily or cinnamon. i give you actual quotes i’ve heard raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog."
9928,Howard,"and i’m gonna miss you, too."
8985,Howard,"it’s delayed. we’re gonna be here at least another week. maybe ten days. it’s the russians, so you don’t know. they left dogs up here in the sixties."
8889,Howard,close your eyes. put out your hand. i got you something special.
8504,Howard,tell her i’m not home!
6558,Howard,"you should thank us. when future generations try to determine why your relationship with penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box. "
11825,Howard,which is?
11199,Howard,i feel like i just made a horrible mistake.
7796,Howard,you think you could be a little more discreet?
6434,Howard,you lucky duck. 
6876,Howard,not a clue.
9492,Howard,what’s going on?
8049,Howard,he is the only person we know with actual muscles.
6243,Howard,"i’m not peter pan, i’m robin hood. "
8226,Howard,and was your card the jack of diamonds?
10445,Howard,"i might argue a hanukkah miracle, but i’ll take it. come on, little guy, let’s get you outside. get the curtain."
9874,Howard,t-minus 30 seconds.
11690,Howard,yeah.
10671,Howard,i’ll figure it out.
10103,Howard,"okay, she’s all settled in the guest room."
8571,Howard,"as i was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. "
9133,Howard,should we follow him?
10725,Howard,"well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge."
8525,Howard,"that’s not my mom, it’s bernadette."
8065,Howard,sounds like we’re in business.
11618,Howard,those do look fun.
6928,Howard,"what am i supposed to do, leonard? there’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. you understand, right?"
8238,Howard,hey!
7251,Howard,whatever.
10544,Howard,just playing video games while bernie does the taxes.
7624,Howard,"so, sheldon, how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?"
9888,Howard,what do you mean?
6755,Howard,"based on the geometric progression, his relationship with stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes."
8037,Howard,"if anybody’s going to go down, it’s going to be you."
11104,Howard,"thank god, ’cause i was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. but i’m also really excited. i mean it."
10598,Howard,i would do that.
9749,Howard,that’s a pretty cool idea.
8594,Howard,"well, yeah."
7581,Howard,"yeah, right, there’s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who’s got music blasting from between his nipples."
11402,Howard,"honey, how ya feeling?  so that’s good news, right?"
10732,Howard,we should have done it months ago.
7059,Howard,"okay, are you from star wars universe?"
8286,Howard,"okay, i’m still trying to work this out. how did penny meet an astronaut?"
6940,Howard,because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.
11908,Howard,it’s hot in here. it must be summer. it’s hot in here. must be summer. it’s hot in here. must be summer.
6527,Howard,"bad, very bad. "
11944,Howard,"well, i don’t know if all that’s true, ’cause you got me, and, baby, i got you."
9354,Howard,"if you don’t leave now, she’ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life."
9506,Howard,classy dog.
8532,Howard,"please, we’re eating. can we get that off the table and change the subject?"
7568,Howard,that’s not true. my happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.
11415,Howard,is that the hot tub?
8072,Howard,"like i was saying, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…"
7484,Howard,of course.
6693,Howard,"you can get them removed early, but you have to take his class."
10478,Howard,"raj, you just got a text. the probe turned on. it’s fine."
10914,Howard,maybe i’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
10565,Howard,"yeah, well, i tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him."
9900,Howard,"i lied about the pepto, i always use the little cup."
11144,Howard,"yeah. but, um, we were talking, and i’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership."
6210,Howard,"oh, then you’re probably okay."
8948,Howard,it’s not definite. i’ll talk to bernadette.
8930,Howard,"i’m excited to talk to you, too."
10252,Howard,we’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.
7181,Howard,ashamed? horrified? repulsed?
6220,Howard,howard wolowitz.
6386,Howard,i don’t think you mean we can’t. i think you mean we shouldn’t. 
7985,Howard,"it’s in hawaii, but raj controls it from here. he’s hoping to see epsilon eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it."
7609,Howard,"so, i was doing some checking on the ring."
9548,Howard,"leonard, i may have gotten you a job."
9738,Howard,"oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?"
9693,Howard,great. will you play the ukulele?
9732,Howard,yeah. see bernie’s engagement ring? that came right off my mom’s back.
7801,Howard,"he said if he had woman parts, he’d eat for free the rest of his life."
8280,Howard,"yes, what?"
7653,Howard,"my power is the ability to pretend like i give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. and that’s 24-7, buddy."
7015,Howard,"you’re right, this filly’s been broken."
8562,Howard,"here’s a radical thought. go old-school, challenge stuart to a fight. i mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed."
11249,Howard,i bet you’d like a drink right now.
11718,Howard,it was really no problem.
10042,Howard,"whatever you hear tonight, just remember i love you. hey."
7473,Howard,like hanukkah in july.
9673,Howard,"ooh, shrimp was spicy."
9942,Howard,you don’t think i did a good job up there?
6189,Howard,these instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. this right here is why sweden has no space program.
8459,Howard,"look, pretty stars. this is her car. she hopes she can see you again sometime."
10571,Howard,i’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do. we’re gonna eat it.
7874,Howard,"well, for all we know, glissinda the troll wasn’t even a real woman. i mean, she could’ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in new jersey."
10373,Howard,and here i am in the trap. you just keep talking. i’m gonna chew my leg off.
7633,Howard,i’ll call you back.
10413,Howard,i thought you did.
6447,Howard,"you can’t do that, look what you’ve created here, it’s like nerdvana. "
10368,Howard,"as you can see, we’re here to cheer you up."
11426,Howard,that’s a kick. that’s an actual kick.
10060,Howard,okay. fine.
10688,Howard,"yes, of course."
8541,Howard,"well, hey, i’m usually pretty good at not blabbing. you tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and i never repeat it."
8763,Howard,have you met my mother? i live in jewish hell.
8505,Howard,you can. i have nothing to say.
11601,Howard,"oh, god. you went through with that? what is wrong with you?"
7326,Howard,not as crazy as my mother makes me.
6623,Howard,told you.
8548,Howard,"a new one? unbelievable. they just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. it’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid."
6853,Howard,oh come on. what do i have to do?
7918,Howard,not that i’ve ever seen.
6932,Howard,thank you. it helps when i get to practice with a real woman.
6277,Howard,what are you guys doing here? 
6671,Howard,"sheldon, you’ve already had four servings."
8979,Howard,i know.
9909,Howard,i’m going to the lego store to get a big-ass r2-d2.
8981,Howard,"okay, here it is. i really miss gravity. can you drop something so i can watch it fall?"
10772,Howard,"well, sheldon, there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting."
11853,Howard,and now the movie just got rated r.
8059,Howard,superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.
7373,Howard,hey! look! amazing spider-man 183.
8519,Howard,"no, you only get one wish."
11383,Howard,cool. ‘cause she says you’re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn’t have to be at every appointment.
11855,Howard,"if you’d like, we can help you out."
9185,Howard,my iron man helmet. koothrappali saw you take it. give it back.
7441,Howard,"hey, i’m interested in what’s inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is halle berry?  yes, you’re delicious caramel, too."
10326,Howard,stick your head in there and find out.
6340,Howard,"stand by. ma, can my friends come over?"
10721,Howard,"that was a big sticky mess, but i think i got it."
7108,Howard,speaking of what goes around comes around…
6494,Howard,"i suppose that’s possible, but for the record, i’ve never had a threesome and yet i still know i want one."
21711,Howard,"no, but if you keep screaming, maybe they’ll hear you!"
9842,Howard,really? i never for a second thought it’d be anything else.
11022,Howard,"oh, that’s what i said an hour ago."
7960,Howard,"olive you, too."
8039,Howard,"you pathetic fool! if there were a rat-catcher, wouldn’t it catch rat-man?"
10383,Howard,"see, i am. isn’t this great?"
7848,Howard,"no, i’m not."
9360,Howard,"hey, raj. what’s up?"
8943,Howard,"hey, ma. you know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer."
9443,Howard,something i should have done a long time ago. 
7469,Howard,what?
9410,Howard,what exactly are you looking up?
7519,Howard,"yes, actual women are the best."
7545,Howard,"sure, no mobsters there."
9312,Howard,"please, i’m working."
7155,Howard,"sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?"
8263,Howard,"i know. it’s her superpower. well, that and jiggling her arm fat."
6491,Howard,actually that was last year. 
6656,Howard,black it is.
8132,Howard,why’s the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
7344,Howard,i totally had a shot.
8234,Howard,three of clubs. 
8456,Howard,texting bernadette that i’m gonna be late.
8815,Howard,"well, it’s probably not for me."
11582,Howard,"okay, this grid represents the room. all we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib."
8073,Howard,"again, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…"
11210,Howard,we did.
7606,Howard,looks like someone drew a penis on him.
8726,Howard,"fine, i’ll change.  "
7858,Howard,in a nutshell.
10541,Howard,how are the taxes going?
9887,Howard,and that’s where darth vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.
7288,Howard,"oh. i get it, i’m the third wheel. sorry, i should have seen that. i’ll get out of your way. uh, you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot."
11450,Howard,"if childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. are we there yet?"
11616,Howard,too late. stuart called dibs.
10429,Howard,"you know, maybe i’m best friends with raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me."
11569,Howard,good night. i love both my girls.
8255,Howard,"well, quite a bit, actually."
10574,Howard,"oh, man. this is the boutonniere from my high school prom. a piece of cake from my bar mitzvah."
8567,Howard,how exactly would these glasses work?
6241,Howard,"gentlemen, to the sewing machines."
9356,Howard,"oh, really? where are your clothes and your shoes?"
10142,Howard,was that a little weird?
9112,Howard,sometime around the third almond joy.
10644,Howard,"ooh, how about a 3-d tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?"
7183,Howard,you are the authority on just fine.
11625,Howard,"okay, i’m zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel."
9196,Howard,"those aren’t gonna help you, sheldon,"
10164,Howard,"you’re right, i’m not. i think it’s weird."
9049,Howard,"so, i did this amazing thing and i’m never allowed to mention it?"
7382,Howard,"hey, don’t bring my mother into this!"
9424,Howard,"hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. this isn’t sex."
8610,Howard,"well, more to the point, why are you doing this?"
6596,Howard,"come on, sheldon, there’s so few places i can wear my jester costume."
7561,Howard,good. p.f. chang’s? my mom has coupons.
7768,Howard,just wait.
9603,Howard,"that’s so great. if you guys prove the existence of unruh radiation… hey, hey, hey, hey. my eyes are up here."
7966,Howard,too bad you don’t have a stadium pal like me.
10958,Howard,why is he looking at it?
7906,Howard,hey.
8045,Howard,"you started it, we just piled on."
7615,Howard,"eddie crispo. anyway, he said this isn’t a replica. it’s the real deal."
7385,Howard,"for god’s sake, i don’t need to hear that! can’t you just say, i’m busy?"
6696,Howard,"when we find it, you want to go with us?"
7246,Howard,yes. and i wouldn’t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.
8227,Howard,"you know, i have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. like, ooh, look! the pencil’s rubber!"
8534,Howard,yeah.
8585,Howard,"okay. okay. now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk."
10986,Howard,hang on. should i send him away?
11282,Howard,not the stick chair. you look like an idiot on that thing.
11493,Howard,"you’re crazy. i’ve worked with hawking. he’s got a great sense of humour, and i think he’d like it."
9204,Howard,stop that. you stop that.
6353,Howard,it means go straight.
7525,Howard,"well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are."
10624,Howard,sam wolowitz is my father.
9289,Howard,we’ve got our costumes in the trunk. we could go there and have a little photo shoot.
9649,Howard,"yeah. i guess i was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was."
6835,Howard,"oh, no. a little electrical tape, some solder. are you insane? i’ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this."
6515,Howard,"this granola bar, there’s peanuts in it."
8927,Howard,"hey, from now on, she’s the only women who can yell at me! until i met you, i couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person. and now i can’t imagine spending one day of it without you."
8899,Howard,wow. okay. let’s get married.
10371,Howard,how can i convince you it won’t?
8516,Howard,"yep, that’s the last jew who did sit-ups. and look where it got him."
7073,Howard,"black case, top compartment."
10606,Howard,"this is ridiculous. i want a new champion. amy, were you serious about being able to serve?"
7050,Howard,"no, we have a little prep work to do. put this in your mouth. we walk past them, you stumble a bit. i say, sorry, my friend’s had a little too much, and then i start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. get it? i mean, they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re millionaires."
7260,Howard,celebrating columbus day.
11211,Howard,you didn’t.
6499,Howard,"okay, well, he might like that, i’ve seen him… chilly. "
7575,Howard,i’m sorry i couldn’t hang with you last night. i had a date with bernadette.
11818,Howard,"you know what? i’m with leonard, this isn’t cool."
9651,Howard,that’s it? no compassion?
6815,Howard,"cherry, please!"
9820,Howard,howdy.
10022,Howard,no. were you seeing other men?
9985,Howard,no.
10259,Howard,but you didn’t hear what it was.
9502,Howard,you mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
7811,Howard,toilet.
10502,Howard,"how are you today, mr. can-you-believe-these-jack-asses?"
7449,Howard,really? tall?
6351,Howard,"no, you’ll be on your hands and knees. now you’ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to sheldon’s room. "
11792,Howard,what are you doing here?
11453,Howard,"oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags."
9473,Howard,money from family does come with strings attached.
9001,Howard,okay.
7035,Howard,"see you, stuart."
7081,Howard,"hi there, howard wolowitz."
10075,Howard,"i just helped my mom out of the tub, so, i’m one slippery horror ahead of you."
8645,Howard,"ma, i told you i have a video conference with nasa. i said don’t bother me!"
6841,Howard,what a jerk.
6934,Howard,"when i go to weddings, it’s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. i don’t know what i would do with a date."
6480,Howard,"look, we have to settle this."
6395,Howard,"unbelievable. components i built are on the international space station, and i get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park. "
9535,Howard,"okay, here we go. you find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. what are you doing in our dungeon? you shall die!"
6475,Howard,"i’m a fancy indian man, we invented pajamas! "
9743,Howard,"so, you’re just an idiot?"
9421,Howard,please be cinderella. please be cinderella.
8883,Howard,"yeah, i’m a funny guy. i also have a hysterical bit planned for later where i pretend to cry through the whole launch."
7598,Howard,"you’re right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, stan lee took stuart and us out for gelato."
8496,Howard,"change your mind about sex? i’m still mad, but i’ll do it."
6670,Howard,her loss. let’s go.
11097,Howard,damn. what is it?
11412,Howard,"damn, so did i."
8365,Howard,she gave me a beautiful watch.
10113,Howard,"no, it’s not."
8671,Howard,what happened to your thumb?
11295,Howard,i’m sure it’s just a coincidence.
10576,Howard,"no, that’s noodle kugel."
8389,Howard,"just his head, right?"
6840,Howard,"alright sheldon, why is tapioca…"
7542,Howard,"boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? just the guys."
9916,Howard,i’m thinking about growing a goatee.
6292,Howard,worked for my parents. 
10896,Howard,"me, too. and we’ve seen the prize."
9029,Howard,"hey, guys, guess who’s back from space."
8983,Howard,"uh, no, not really."
6208,Howard,"i don’t know, you guys work in the same lab."
8847,Howard,"all right, well, whatever. i wasn’t worried."
6753,Howard,two booty calls with leslie winkle.
9562,Howard,i’m proud of you.
7381,Howard,"yeah, well, you think i was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say “have you ever peed so much in your life?”"
6783,Howard,"ooh, “dave.” sounds like leonard’s got a new bff."
10528,Howard,i don’t know.
7454,Howard,why not?
8766,Howard,get out of my lab.
10249,Howard,that does sound fun.
10880,Howard,"because when my dad left, i promised myself that if i ever had a chance to be a father i’d always be there."
6424,Howard,sheldon. 
10473,Howard,"yeah. just, uh, is there anything i should know before i go in?"
8157,Howard,your call.
11007,Howard,"hey, she came all the way here…"
11271,Howard,but i got a baby on the way. i got to make some money.
7529,Howard,what do you think? want to jump right into the middle of another couple’s argument?
8895,Howard,what?
8734,Howard,"no, uh, i don’t think so."
6259,Howard,if we’re having anchovies on the pizza we can’t take it out of bathroom time. 
6326,Howard,"so, road trip to long beach."
10387,Howard,doesn’t professor abbott’s family want any of this stuff?
8270,Howard,"no, not a clue."
8168,Howard,i need a place to crash.
9889,Howard,why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?
10058,Howard,"can i say just one more thing? i had some kind of food poisoning that day. sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. nor was climbing out your window and running away. but i think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and i’d really appreciate it if we could move on."
6918,Howard,"oh, it’s great. everybody in the engineering department is eating their hearts out."
11221,Howard,"actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag."
7396,Howard,i am.
10209,Howard,"the angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?"
9725,Howard,look who’s here to put the jew in jewellery night.
10441,Howard,great. do it.
11727,Howard,"huh, so you can tell what that feels like. interesting."
11929,Howard,do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?
9932,Howard,"sit down. nasa called. the telescope mount i installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it."
6778,Howard,"did, too."
7339,Howard,"that chick, she smiled at me."
6996,Howard,"oh, god, we’re never gonna finish in time. who made sheldon the boss anyway?"
7864,Howard,she does?
9897,Howard,he just parked. he’s on his way up.
9832,Howard,i know you’re starving. the neighbours know you’re starving. there’s starving people in africa who know you’re starving.
7672,Howard,i guessed premature. does that count?
7297,Howard,"you and i made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends."
9284,Howard,"hey, janine. how are tom and the kids?"
8158,Howard,"boy, i don’t know. you, me, ma living under the same roof?"
8554,Howard,very.
6986,Howard,you’re kidding. any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.
6426,Howard,"760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row."
11895,Howard,hey!
9460,Howard,"oh, yeah, what’s that?"
7515,Howard,"honest to god. leonard, tell her i have a girlfriend."
6304,Howard,"no problem, turning it down.  et voila. "
6430,Howard,a time machine from the movie the time machine? 
11897,Howard,"hey, qu’est q’wass up?"
11685,Howard,"well, comic-con tickets go on sale this friday, and i was hoping i could go with the guys. but before you say anything, i’ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, i mean everything. i’m even gonna answer for you. yes, howard, you can go. "
7281,Howard,"okay, i guess i can hang for a little while. so what are we watching? sex and the city."
11673,Howard,"oh, better luck next time, pink cheeks."
10003,Howard,"does a brisket count? i’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. but didn’t she know we were coming?"
11315,Howard,"that’s great, now they know where i live."
10308,Howard,not a lot.
11566,Howard,do you need help getting out?
10625,Howard,"well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you’re my half-brother?"
9976,Howard,it’s not every day you get to tour nasa with a real astronaut.
7232,Howard,let’s go.
8761,Howard,"sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. why on earth would i want to do something nice for you?"
10123,Howard,how you feeling?
10662,Howard,sure.
9367,Howard,"well, i was trying to come up with something really romantic to give bernadette for valentine’s day since she’s been such a pain in the ass."
10926,Howard,"wh, what are you doing here?"
6829,Howard,look at me. what chance do i have if i don’t try too hard?
10665,Howard,the plaque they sent up on the pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
11055,Howard,"um, taking care of injured rabbit. okay. make sure it’s comfortable and warm. well, it was just in a hot tub. i’m gonna say check."
8366,Howard,hey.
7656,Howard,what’s with him?
7934,Howard,"and as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into leonard’s food."
7044,Howard,"all right, the three musketeers just became the dynamic duo."
11548,Howard,"hey, guys."
9525,Howard,nice guilt trip. you are gonna be an amazing mom.
9317,Howard,"and we can make stuff we need for work with it. prototypes of my cad/cam designs, specialized tools…"
9590,Howard,i feel so stupid. and fat.
9005,Howard,okay.
9991,Howard,it’s over.
8873,Howard,"i’m aware of that, sir."
8136,Howard,what about sheldon?
7127,Howard,really?
6317,Howard,"that would be me. hey, check it out, it’s a featured video. . "
10894,Howard,"i have an idea. what if we put a post on craigslist that says world-class caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. if interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him."
8257,Howard,"also, tonight’s the sabbath and my mother and i have a tradition of lighting the candles and"
10963,Howard,same here!
9675,Howard,"tell me about it. one time, i swear i pooped out a stick of chalk.  i’ll get it."
11435,Howard,"okay, well, i may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety. "
10573,Howard,okay. then how about this? let’s invite everyone over to dinner. it’ll be like ma’s feeding us one last time.
8507,Howard,"if you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil."
9918,Howard,say what?
6387,Howard,"uh-uh. i know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won’t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. and if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you’re in the back seat of your mom’s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you."
11526,Howard,and talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy.
9631,Howard,"they’re coming to america, they’re coming to america."
9610,Howard,why?
7972,Howard,let’s see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.
9331,Howard,not just for a couple of dolls. for as many dolls as we want. and whistles.
9768,Howard,so your wife’s in arizona with the grandkids?
8197,Howard,you don’t have to take me. you get to take me.
8694,Howard,"yeah, but it’s from nasa, so it’s oh eight hundred."
8767,Howard,get out.
6201,Howard,i am the swordmaster!
9971,Howard,that’s sheldon. he says he’ll be down in a minute.
7565,Howard,"sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
9766,Howard,does he?
11559,Howard,it has been hard to sleep with all the crying.
8256,Howard,"yes, he does live with his parents. here’s a google earth shot of their house."
8497,Howard,really?
10141,Howard,you call her debbie?
6858,Howard,"okay, i guess we only have one option."
8259,Howard,"i am. she’s just bleaching her moustache. check it out. hey, ma! before and after! four words, 17 letters, two n’s, one v."
8269,Howard,19th-century technology.
8577,Howard,"ah, let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. oh, look what my mom made us for the act."
7118,Howard,not enough bread crumbs.
11391,Howard,but how delightful was it when i pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? it’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.
9422,Howard,milady.
7413,Howard,"oh, my god, could it be? yes! my mother put an i love you brisket in my backpack."
10093,Howard,"me, too."
6695,Howard,so based on our triangulation we’ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the hollywood hills.
8705,Howard,"uh-huh. except you don’t have food or water, and they don’t have a sunset sabbath service like they do at camp hess-kramer."
6256,Howard,"watch this, it’s really cool. call leonard hofstadter."
7732,Howard,horse.
7728,Howard,"if it’s not too much trouble, i’d like to point this at the moon now."
10990,Howard,"you know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want."
11181,Howard,and it just got weird.
6723,Howard,"no, there were three other guys with eye patches, iit was a fiasco. what did work was, “how’d you like to visit a secret government facility?”"
6458,Howard,"nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and… bam!  howard wolowitz. "
8965,Howard,bye.
7783,Howard,"no, no! don’t touch, the program is paused."
6610,Howard,so what’s your news?
9705,Howard,"oh, don’t worry about it. i brought the date here. guys, come on in."
7819,Howard,philadelphia.
7857,Howard,no. stop asking.
9699,Howard,"no, i want this to be romantic."
7958,Howard,"actually, i’m not. i’m using sarcasm to mock you."
8305,Howard,you mean adolf and eva? not yet. one goose step at a time.
9632,Howard,today!
9190,Howard,give me back my iron man helmet.
8826,Howard,"hi, bernie, it’s me again. please call me back."
11997,Howard,for information and entertainment.
11394,Howard,but you just said you wanted to know.
8217,Howard,a magician never reveals his secrets. but surely a future nobel prize winner can figure it out.
11976,Howard,what do you want?
7298,Howard,"so you’ve been with penny for like a month and a half now. where’s my shorty, morty?"
9851,Howard,i’m in the middle of something.
7174,Howard,"sheldon, you’re wrong. wolverine was not born with bone claws."
6375,Howard,then our problem would be solved. 
9178,Howard,"yep. for as long as i can keep my mother out of it. if you want to check it out later, it’s parked right out front, space 294."
7052,Howard,"i can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine."
9847,Howard,fake a laugh? do you ever do that with me?
6921,Howard,"i’m busy, ma!"
11193,Howard,"look, raj, you’re my best friend in the world and i really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby."
6195,Howard,"stay frosty, there’s a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the sword of azeroth."
11120,Howard,"oh, i don’t think there will be."
6180,Howard,.
8070,Howard,why am i listed as your executive assistant?
6908,Howard,"oh, uh, no big deal. they gave leslie control of some unrestricted grant money."
8788,Howard,"funny thing is, i only have one belt. anyway, i’ll let you get started. oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, i tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you’re seeing there is splash back."
8682,Howard,they’ve got a phone.
10129,Howard,because you had sex the other night?
6407,Howard,fire away. 
10555,Howard,great. neither of those. try a hammer.
9009,Howard,"yeah, well, bernie’s not feeling well, so i thought i’d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it."
8033,Howard,"all right, how about this? ready, wrestle."
9183,Howard,nope.
6681,Howard,"oh, look, the’s the future mrs. wolowitz. no, wait, that’s the future mrs. wolowitz. with her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. it’s the future mrs. wolowitz."
11314,Howard,i have performance anxiety. you of all people should know that.
7538,Howard,"hey, i’m sure penny fakes all kinds of things when she’s with you."
6265,Howard,"ah, well then we’ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection."
9256,Howard,"okay. oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, mike?"
7742,Howard,"trust me, breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman."
7533,Howard,"seventh base with shirt off. well, my shirt. how’d things go with penny?"
6358,Howard,"oh, i guess you didn’t. "
8346,Howard,"you gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty."
10198,Howard,"well, i dropped your class, so i hope you’re happy."
8750,Howard,her. we thought you two would hit it off.
10408,Howard,"yeah, she works at a law firm in new york."
8303,Howard,bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the old town deli.
6977,Howard,"but before i go, would you mind if i just take one picture of us together for my facebook page?"
10270,Howard,"excuse me. ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and stuart is not your bubala, i’m your bubala. you can’t have more than one bubala."
9645,Howard,sorry. 
8868,Howard,from nuts?
10707,Howard,all right. all systems go. in five…
11274,Howard,you got something better?
9644,Howard,wow. sex at work?
8593,Howard,"yeah, no, we all got that. but don’t you think it’ll be different when the child is ours?"
9186,Howard,"sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and i want it back."
7392,Howard,"alright, let’s see what’s on the east coast feed."
10995,Howard,"well, i was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave."
10646,Howard,"oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit."
6453,Howard,shhh! hot girl in sheldon’s office. 
11019,Howard,"that’s ridiculous. if you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?"
8659,Howard,i don’t think i could ever let a guy give me a massage.
8480,Howard,"it’s me, sheldon. it’s me. i’m going up in space! technically, i’m an astronaut."
8184,Howard,uh…
6406,Howard,"perpetual motion squad, we can go all night."
8633,Howard,i got pretty exciting nasa news today. next week i fly to houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.
8487,Howard,this isn’t the reaction i expected when i told you i was gonna be an astronaut.
10710,Howard,"hang on, hang on. it’s working. i did it."
8066,Howard,"sheldon, i don’t think penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…"
7736,Howard,"tons. i’ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. and twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left."
11272,Howard,"okay, let me stop you right there. we absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world."
11649,Howard,that’s right. we figured it out all by ourselves. wasn’t even that hard.
9105,Howard,i will. i’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. i’m not a child.
9408,Howard,not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. and have enough milk left over to open a baskin robbins.
10055,Howard,"look, i have felt terrible about this for years, and i’m glad i have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry i am."
11047,Howard,"sorry, but too hot is the only temperature i come in."
6897,Howard,i had to take her! it’s almost bathing suit weather!
9120,Howard,where we going?
6163,Howard,it’s before he became a creepy computer voice:.
6812,Howard,"i don’t go to school, ma. i work at a university."
11191,Howard,just supportive. not over-the-top in any way?
10870,Howard,sorry. do you have a sense of where we are?
11028,Howard,what are you doing? you have a girlfriend.
11822,Howard,"she didn’t say much of anything. but she said a lot.  hi, bernadette, remember me?"
7780,Howard,"yes. now, help me!"
6720,Howard,on a dusty highway just outside bakersfield. where do you think? on mars!
8666,Howard,i don’t know.
7467,Howard,gals? chicks? utero-americans?
11018,Howard,"ooh, check out the stripper pole."
11564,Howard,oh. this is new.
7661,Howard,"okay, how about this for a topic, why is leonard being a giant douche? assuming giant douches are possible."
7264,Howard,"well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil."
9826,Howard,"doesn’t matter. bernadette still would’ve been working at the cheesecake factory, and i still would’ve been working this beefcake factory. you would’ve been all over me."
10361,Howard,"oh, my god, i, i’m sorry. i mean, if you’re not up to it, we don’t have to go out, we can just hang here."
11760,Howard,good. love you.
9798,Howard,"no, she always looks like that. because she married an idiot."
11031,Howard,you weren’t there. he was really flirting.
11714,Howard,what?
8411,Howard,"i got it! oh, hi."
6369,Howard,"no, you don’t understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah, okay, it’s a shelf. "
9666,Howard,my arm is feeling numb.
10787,Howard,great. he’s pushing with his uterus.
11046,Howard,i’m gonna check the temp on the tub.
7774,Howard,"raj and i entered sheldon’s information on a dating site, and it spit out amy farrah fowler."
8814,Howard,"what can i tell ya, i’m not into that stuff any more."
6769,Howard,"oh, yeah. it’s beyond contemptible."
11859,Howard,yeah. like bernadette used to look at me.
9522,Howard,what?
9934,Howard,are you kidding? it was the greatest experience of my life.
9291,Howard,"sheldon, how is that a fight pose?"
7429,Howard,three dates means sex? who knew?
9076,Howard,"that somewhere right now stephen hawking is saying, damn it, i meant to click no.”"
8131,Howard,you’re thinking of 28 days later. 28 days is where sandra bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
9890,Howard,why do you think i told him to come to your place?
8200,Howard,"whoa, whoa, whoa! where did that come from?"
9338,Howard,great. come on in.
9340,Howard,"no, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. it’s part of a bonus she got."
8752,Howard,"believe me, i know. the e-mail i got was from the office of stephen hawking."
11141,Howard,here we go with the ironclad logic again.
10298,Howard,negative reinforcement is really wrong?
9074,Howard,"okay, i get it."
11782,Howard,"look, if you’re not ready to go back to work, we’ll figure something out."
6468,Howard,"do you like motorcycles, ‘cos i ride a hog. "
6974,Howard,"okay, i’m going to just go for broke here and say i like you."
10446,Howard,"you were right. go ahead, call building services. tell them it was my fault."
9969,Howard,isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…
10730,Howard,you mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do?
6951,Howard,"sheldon, i owe you an apology. taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! i’ve actually got a shot at a terminator."
9994,Howard,thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
11836,Howard,"although, if anyone’s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, it’d be penny."
9477,Howard,"ooh, meerkat fight!"
7457,Howard,"no. i’m serious. i’m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real."
9672,Howard,i don’t know. sounds kind of heavy.
6330,Howard,how can i ask them when i’m talking to you!  hello.
6789,Howard,it’s happening to us.
9747,Howard,you had to be taught not to play with cobras?
9907,Howard,you okay?
7513,Howard,"no, really. i have a girlfriend now."
11824,Howard,"well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper."
7104,Howard,you don’t know what this is?
9055,Howard,nothing.
21708,Howard,"yeah, we can go over to my place."
7588,Howard,you’ve also got something from the pasadena municipal court.
6523,Howard,"look, all i need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so i can pretend i had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half. "
8172,Howard,there’s no room. his sister is staying with him.
11969,Howard,"come on, guys. let’s do this."
7689,Howard,which way are you going?
9635,Howard,let’s go.
10949,Howard,"oh, he’s our fan."
11752,Howard,"come on, be honest. did you tell her i tried her breast pump?"
8479,Howard,who’s mohammed lee?
8839,Howard,"couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. i’ll tell you later."
7362,Howard,"really, now? with the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. the tar pits. let’s go."
11070,Howard,"continued on milk. if you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. are. we are. see spoons for more."
8668,Howard,"yeah, actually, it’s good for both of us. i have assets to protect, too."
10947,Howard,"damn. i don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or i’m his. hey, trent just liked our comment."
6200,Howard,leonard look out!
9484,Howard,"you know what’s going on, don’t you?"
9706,Howard,"well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and i wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you."
9370,Howard,"mmm, about twelve hours. i pulled an all-nighter."
9572,Howard,looks like she accepted your apology.
9543,Howard,it’s a hit. the dragon collapses to the ground.
7470,Howard,"hey, fellas. this is my girlfriend bernadette. my girlfriend bernadette."
11672,Howard,what if there’s someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?
6784,Howard,so? we’re in a rock band.
7548,Howard,i got a buddy over at the department of defence.
11152,Howard,i appreciate that.
11611,Howard,"well, like you gals, i had to suffer through him to find bernadette."
10248,Howard,"all i know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. i mean, four-ply. if his butt is so delicate, why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?"
8220,Howard,"oh, really? so how did i do it?"
8361,Howard,so do you know what kind of research you’ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?
7629,Howard,you do realize there’s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the syfy channel. 
7743,Howard,"i’ll show you a picture of my uncle louie in a bathing suit sometime. leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for sheldon."
6442,Howard,"good choice, alexander graham bell invents the telephone and calls out for dr watson."
11166,Howard,"well, i lie a lot."
6396,Howard,"wow, i almost didn’t recognise him."
8840,Howard,"so, is the wedding still on?"
10498,Howard,"yeah, no problem."
7541,Howard,your new girlfriend. have fun tonight.
9956,Howard,you mean tings like moo-stache?
9999,Howard,they are only from me. you said the gift of you was enough.
10488,Howard,"well, i don’t think that’s gonna help at all."
8578,Howard,"well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. she made these two vests and half a dozen napkins."
8077,Howard,"okay, let’s try this one. spherical hankel function."
11067,Howard,"no, when i sat on the mute button and thought i’d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria."
8823,Howard,"how about you? did you have a fun night? yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this."
7880,Howard,"oh, no, that’s okay. how have you been?"
8941,Howard,"i mean, it’s not, like, hd quality."
9090,Howard,good for you.
7647,Howard,didn’t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?
6404,Howard,outweigh the needs of the few. 
11157,Howard,"what can i say, i play hard, i solder even harder."
11561,Howard,"shh, i don’t hate you. "
6742,Howard,did someone just feel a cold breeze?
9433,Howard,juggle.
6655,Howard,"fine, what colour do you want?"
7107,Howard,"maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself."
6578,Howard,no kidding?
7546,Howard,"all right, we’ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system."
9781,Howard,sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
9764,Howard,"um, i don’t know. probably in a wad in her cheek."
11592,Howard,because that’s not what people do.
6797,Howard,"all right, that’s the last servo. behold the mobile omnidirectional neutralization and termination eradicator. or…"
10279,Howard,hey. i didn’t think you’d make it.
6229,Howard,"if you’re into music, i happen to be a human beatbox. "
10000,Howard,what’s wrong?
6476,Howard,"i’m warning you, i was judo champion at math camp. "
8673,Howard,"oh, yeah, sure."
8290,Howard,"i’m not grilling you, i was just curious."
10024,Howard,"he’s gonna die alone, right?"
9711,Howard,bernie’s having a girls’ night on friday at our place. you want to do something?
10296,Howard,"that’s ridiculous. sheldon, i vote that is not a tangent."
10980,Howard,social anxiety.
6538,Howard,i really don’t think the colonoscopy was necessary. 
7472,Howard,thought i’d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.
11324,Howard,"i don’t know. they take the invention away, and i get nothing?"
10182,Howard,"i’d use feynman’s trick, differentiate under the integral sign."
10375,Howard,"okay, okay. i really don’t like how your wings poke me when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel."
11570,Howard,"not me, paternity leave."
9119,Howard,"you know, she’s why i first got into magic. i would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. and part way through the act, i would say i needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. i can still remember the way she’d smile. for a few minutes, she’d forget how lonely she was."
10742,Howard,you need to take that?
6203,Howard,"stealing snail mail, very old school, i like it. "
6941,Howard,how so?
7630,Howard,"you know, there’s a point when this becomes idiotic."
6525,Howard,"no, you don’t understand."
10482,Howard,"okay, emily or cinnamon? check it out, i got us matching sweaters."
7509,Howard,it was a full turtleneck. why aren’t you helping me?
6732,Howard,"erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run."
6298,Howard,"oh, no it isn’t. "
11223,Howard,don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?
6452,Howard,i guess that makes me large breasts. 
10053,Howard,"one roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, i was so humiliated, i snuck out the window and never saw her again."
7310,Howard,"good, good."
6888,Howard,why is it always my responsibility?
6726,Howard,"yeah. no. i’m sorry, but something’s come up. kind of a mars rover, mars rover, can howard come over, situation. so my friend leonard is gonna take you home."
9161,Howard,why would you know that?
6384,Howard,all he has to do now is hook up with one of them. 
6608,Howard,creepy good or creepy bad?
10280,Howard,"well, ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit."
10006,Howard,"well, don’t do it on the phone."
11261,Howard,"yeah, hey, buddy."
10911,Howard,"if you can’t support me when i’m lying, why are we married?"
11300,Howard,"i don’t know what to do. it’s the air force. i mean, should i respond to their e-mail? ignore it?"
9896,Howard,yeah. what about it?
10226,Howard,that was a close one.
7676,Howard,"so would ben affleck. the point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. you’re either on team leonard or team penny."
10630,Howard,"i don’t know. i, i’d just like him to go away. i can’t deal with this."
7065,Howard,she dumped me!
11914,Howard,"okay, i get it, you’re angry. you don’t want to see your little bird leave the nest."
7815,Howard,"ah, ah."
11965,Howard,oy vay!
9307,Howard,"easy. his family’s loaded, and bernadette has a great job. my wife came with both fun bags and money bags."
9600,Howard,"okay, let me feel. no, i am definitely up a cup size. "
11896,Howard,"penny, look, i’ve got a problem."
8160,Howard,"we wait for my mom’s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom."
10861,Howard,i want to change my answer.
10828,Howard,"well said, puss."
7333,Howard,"listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime."
8423,Howard,problem solved.
9789,Howard,i promise i’ll help out the rest of the week.
6376,Howard,"we don’t have to go that far, there are other means available."
9667,Howard,"my point is, i’m sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long."
7831,Howard,"women, huh? can’t live with them, can’t successfully refute their hypotheses."
8650,Howard,"yeah, my ring tone. kind of my favourite song, rocket man."
10005,Howard,then don’t say anything.
7978,Howard,is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? that happens with me and my mom all the time.
6232,Howard,"hey, look, it’s doctor stud!"
7271,Howard,what do you mean you didn’t get the job? how could you not get it?
6788,Howard,"don’t feel bad, penny, it’s a classic rookie mistake. my first hanukkah with sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights."
7817,Howard,"um, tell us about your work, amy."
8551,Howard,you interested in amy?
10936,Howard,wait a second. how could you do that without consulting me?
10931,Howard,is that a job offer? ‘cause i really want to go to mars. assuming i can bring my wife. she hardly takes up any room. she’s basically a carry-on.
7903,Howard,i had a good time.
10638,Howard,you are my brother.
6188,Howard,she hugged you? how did she hug you?  is that her perfume i smell?
7907,Howard,"oh, hey. i hope you didn’t hear that."
9374,Howard,sorry we’re late.
10243,Howard,since when do you read social science?
11820,Howard,"i just told you, your mom’s."
11280,Howard,some of these guys make over $20 an hour.
9952,Howard,"go, go, go."
8024,Howard,how did you get so brave all of a sudden?
7983,Howard,what kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?
8632,Howard,"emergency drill night last night, huh?"
9267,Howard,never heard of it. must be the one christmas song not written by a jewish guy.
9328,Howard,i thought you might.
11527,Howard,"all right, enough with the camera."
10285,Howard,also mine.
11149,Howard,"all right, let’s sign this."
8095,Howard,oh! that’s a relief.
7950,Howard,you’re giving me a couch cushion?
11281,Howard,"we’ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven’t we?"
10192,Howard,"if you’re gonna be a crappy teacher, then i’m gonna be a crappy student.  uh, uh, ludacris going in on the verse. ’cause i never been defeated and i won’t stop now…"
9138,Howard,what could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
10087,Howard,"since we all agree episode i isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time."
8724,Howard,"i had no choice. last night, she said, why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the arboretum. and i said, well, no, i promised the guys i was going to play a video game with them all weekend. and she said, that sounds like fun, can i come, too? and then i didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? and then i bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now."
10205,Howard,because we were awkward and weird and couldn’t play sports!
9243,Howard,"yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday."
6746,Howard,"leonard, stephanie, you’re alive, it’s a miracle!"
10303,Howard,so what did you want to know?
7446,Howard,you want to play cylon and colonist?
11452,Howard,"i’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one."
11192,Howard,astronauts saw him carrying that.
7279,Howard,but he’s working with sheldon.
6403,Howard,what? why?
8754,Howard,i was actually thinking about bringing him along when i go over there so he can meet the great man.
6390,Howard,"oh no, she’ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this. "
6859,Howard,see ya.
7408,Howard,no! what about slim jims?
8490,Howard,"i’m sorry. you’re right. okay, let’s try this again. bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and i’d like to discuss it."
11431,Howard,are we even in a good school…? ow!
6563,Howard,give him time.
7939,Howard,"hey, buddies. guess who didn’t get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?"
10219,Howard,great. you take this and say when to stop. how much further?
7949,Howard,"oh. sheldon, you can’t fix this with gifts."
11036,Howard,"no, i didn’t."
11659,Howard,"ha, you’re interested. you’re out ten bucks."
10724,Howard,"like, a random person or somebody she knew?"
7601,Howard,would you just let it go?
12000,Howard,hey.
9379,Howard,"i told you, turn them inside out."
11283,Howard,you look like you come with a kickstand.
9550,Howard,"yeah, i’ve worked with hawking. i talked you up. he knows your research. i think this could happen."
10424,Howard,like when?
8885,Howard,check.
9432,Howard,"you know, if he really wants to stay and finish, i can give him a ride home."
10201,Howard,"yeah. okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?"
9545,Howard,"oh, yeah? well, when we get home, i’m gonna take you on a whole different adventure."
6605,Howard,"mmmm, testify. "
7103,Howard,"classified, leonard."
11613,Howard,don’t beat yourself up. that’s what i’m here for.
8843,Howard,"well, that’s it. my orders have been rescinded. i am officially no go to space."
10116,Howard,"i’m coming, you big baby."
10050,Howard,please don’t say it.
10902,Howard,what?
7102,Howard,"yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the space station. we gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine."
6185,Howard,what’s his problem?
8274,Howard,i’m gonna ask her to marry me.
11290,Howard,"oh, my god. it’s working."
10110,Howard,sounds like a job for a loving person. would you like me to play some polish music while you carry her to the toilet?
8424,Howard,"oh, come on, honey. she’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. you can’t see anything. i go in all the time."
7401,Howard,"up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky."
10242,Howard,hey.
11985,Howard,"indy’ whip snapped, thor’s hammer missed."
7594,Howard,"okay, i’m cutting. i’m not gonna talk to stan lee after you cheese him off."
11956,Howard,"sorry i’m late. uh, i got great news. nasa picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the international space station this spring."
6692,Howard,"okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence."
6807,Howard,"um, so what are you saying?"
11801,Howard,"okay, challenge them again."
7596,Howard,that’s ’cause you pissed him off about his character names.
7291,Howard,"all right, raj has played his phantom warlord card, and i am going to back him up with my strangling vines. choke on that, sucka."
6316,Howard,more often than you’d think.
6413,Howard,he compared sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer’s eve. 
9567,Howard,how’d it go?
10635,Howard,"hey, i threw out the first pitch at an angels game."
7997,Howard,hold on. he could come back.
6433,Howard,"don’t worry, the way these things work there’s people waiting ‘til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it’s called sniping."
8871,Howard,i’m sorry. may i be excused?
10335,Howard,"fine, it bothers me. you happy?"
6666,Howard,"to watch, right?"
7922,Howard,let’s just agree they’re both hot.
10925,Howard,"y, you’re elon musk."
8337,Howard,"hey, how’d it go?"
6700,Howard,"that’s it. there’s the house, i found america’s top models!"
10235,Howard,wish me luck.
8013,Howard,mouse boy?
9495,Howard,"is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?"
7289,Howard,ill just hang out with my mom. that’s always fun.
8877,Howard,but what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?
7569,Howard,"although, i’d be lying if i said it wasn’t a little bit of a perk."
11817,Howard,again.
6861,Howard,he was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he’d get his shrimp lo mein for free.
10073,Howard,"that’s actually not a bad plan. i can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time i was like, oh my god, a prune pit."
10426,Howard,"well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?"
8328,Howard,"it’s the circle of life, sweetie. one day our son will marry someone and it will kill you."
6877,Howard,"how about that, you were right."
10505,Howard,this wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.
6785,Howard,yep. it’s officially a bro-mance.
9113,Howard,"yeah, i guess. hey, would you do me a favour? go on ahead. i just want one last moment alone in my old room."
7850,Howard,not that kind of confused.
7194,Howard,hmm.
6244,Howard,"just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky i’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver. "
11471,Howard,"no, she’s right. as long as i’ve known you, you’ve always been self-conscious about your cleavage."
7738,Howard,he didn’t find a wife. they built him a wife out of dead body parts.
9298,Howard,i wish my mom was here. we could all hang out in her shadow.
8203,Howard,thank you.
11945,Howard,"no, it’s not necessarily proportional. shut up!"
7489,Howard,always le seur peas with lamb stew!
8857,Howard,"you’re right. i, i can’t go to space. i have to get married, and no one can say that’s not a good reason. i’ll call him back."
9784,Howard,"well, sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and i tried to tell them about how sad i was when my dad abandoned…"
6678,Howard,did you pay your cable bill?
7123,Howard,"just imagine. if he says yes, we’ll have an entire summer without sheldon."
9272,Howard,"yes, we found santa. christmas is saved. don’t ever tell my mother i said that."
8819,Howard,don’t remember. please sit down.
8492,Howard,"hey, we’re a team. so, what do you think?"
6968,Howard,you tell me.
6164,Howard,"yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?"
8206,Howard,"raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time sheldon got punched by bill gates?"
21704,Howard,so do i.
8205,Howard,"oh, please. that crazy bastard’s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror."
7430,Howard,"greetings, homies, homette."
8134,Howard,"okay, let’s go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus."
10288,Howard,we got to watch back to the future ii.
11540,Howard,"come on, bernie, breathe. remember what you learned in birthing class."
6574,Howard,just get in the bed!
6583,Howard,"koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn’t get to sleep, so i gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom’s valium in it. but he still wouldn’t shut up, so, tag, you’re it. "
11189,Howard,so you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?
9455,Howard,it’s okay. sorry i ran off like that.
7828,Howard,"yeah, we all thought so."
11327,Howard,the air force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. they want to have a meeting.
6911,Howard,in the paintball shed! twice!
11301,Howard,"one sec. i’m just afraid if i respond, then they’ll know i got it."
6331,Howard,"dear lord, not milky green! "
10111,Howard,as advertised.
7393,Howard,"oh, this sucks, i’m switching back to real sex."
10988,Howard,wow. i thought i was done getting lucky tonight.
7710,Howard,hi.
9308,Howard,"oh, man. look at my nose."
8410,Howard,movie theatre.
10593,Howard,"come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what i paid for it."
9192,Howard,"well, we appear to have reached an impasse. and you know, i have to say, i thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk."
9772,Howard,you ever play football?
8502,Howard,"i don’t know. if we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that i’m a grown man who can make his own decisions."
7432,Howard,"hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?"
6359,Howard,good. from this point forward you will have to crawl. 
8745,Howard,"why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you."
11777,Howard,how about after this we go see the exotic bird show?
11766,Howard,it doesn’t?
10933,Howard,"a partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? with elon musk, you bet i do."
11667,Howard,"we are, that’s why i’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless."
7169,Howard,"howdy, ma’am."
10740,Howard,it’s hard not to. they taste so much better than real berries.
7834,Howard,you should lend him your copy of bombay badonkadonks.
11345,Howard,really? you’re a physicist?
8980,Howard,"love you too. hey, bernie? before you go, can you do something for me?"
7188,Howard,"okay, you were right about wolverine and bone claws, but you’re wrong about the cricket."
6219,Howard,right. sorry.
7752,Howard,"okay, what if i were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?"
8545,Howard,"all right, sheldon, your bird death ray is ready."
8237,Howard,incoming.
11101,Howard,thank you.
6254,Howard,"he’s not the marvel comic story, he’s the original norse god. "
9844,Howard,"i’m serious. go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary."
9803,Howard,just go.
7319,Howard,either.
10585,Howard,that’s not true. we’ve got tomatoes right here.
7645,Howard,what’s your point?
10244,Howard,i don’t want to talk about it.
11508,Howard,"yeah, let him do it."
7182,Howard,sex is never the way i dream it’s gonna be.
11065,Howard,"good. thank you. oh, okay, there is a test. all they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain."
11418,Howard,"maybe. how ’bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?"
9188,Howard,hi sheldon.
7013,Howard,i know you. you’re stupid enough to break it up.
10169,Howard,don’t talk to her like that. that is my mother. wife. my wife. i said my wife.
10213,Howard,"hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game."
8605,Howard,really? that’s great. what?
6594,Howard,"yeah, so, be a tool. go get yourself a little rebound stress release."
8447,Howard,"look, i don’t know the sign for opalescent."
10609,Howard,"okay, this is the match that decides it all. first to 11 wins. serve switches every five points. and just so you know, when this started, i was going to put the tardis in a discreet corner of the house, but i’ve since turned mean, and now it’s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. game on."
6479,Howard,"is it ‘cause i’m jewish, ‘cause i’d kill my rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister."
6584,Howard,renaissance fairs aren’t about historical accuracy. they’re about taking chubby girls who work at kinko’s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.
8170,Howard,"no, we agreed they all have their merits. this was about bernadette."
10722,Howard,"yes, i cleaned it up all by myself. honestly, i don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe i missed one spot. just leave."
10492,Howard,it’s just so perfect that we’re both libras.
10792,Howard,yep. a six-foot wiener in a flash t-shirt.
7190,Howard,"okay, okay, tell you what. i am willing to bet anything that’s an ordinary field cricket."
7993,Howard,"three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 rupees, six, seven, whoops. can’t go any further. there’s a sacred cow in my way."
9429,Howard,"no, we wouldn’t ask him. we’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there."
9383,Howard,so where’d you hide it?
6362,Howard,antonio salieri?
7336,Howard,kites ho!
10826,Howard,"the other day, when she tried to put that fitbit on me and i ran away from her."
7462,Howard,"i want to dedicate this number to a great gal who i’ve done wrong.   bernadette, i am so sorry for trying to propose to you, bernadette, you found it creepy but that’s just the kind of thing i do. i know now it was too soon to talk of love. it was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. but, bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet bernadette, i’ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet bernadette, i dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet bernadette. sincerely yours, howard wolowitz, bernadette…"
10281,Howard,here we go.
7356,Howard,"i know, i know."
8849,Howard,"make all the jokes you want, but there’s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what i almost did."
6478,Howard,wait a minute. leonard made you aware of that? 
11589,Howard,"bigger problems, i felt something pop. "
8212,Howard,"now spread them out on the table face down. pick one, look at it."
7096,Howard,it’s gonna fail after about ten flushes.
7973,Howard,"you want to talk brave, how about captain america’s undocumented mexican gardener?"
11915,Howard,"fine, i’ll stay! you happy, crazy lady? i sure as hell hope so, because you’re ruining my life!"
8827,Howard,"it’s not your fault, it’s mine. i did all that stuff, not you."
9823,Howard,"hope you’re thirsty, here it comes."
10830,Howard,yeah. i already ran 18 miles today.
10614,Howard,"no, i’m not."
9132,Howard,"no, you didn’t."
10794,Howard,"yeah, i saw it on mythbusters."
11628,Howard,what’s wrong?
10929,Howard,"sorry. it’s just, you’re you, you know? and i really want you to adopt me."
11260,Howard,really? nothing?
9692,Howard,so i’m almost done writing the song for bernadette. are you cool playing the cello?
8350,Howard,better than what you’ve got a buttload of.
10511,Howard,"well, i’m her son, how come she doesn’t send someone to check on me if i’m lonely?"
7412,Howard,"hot dogs, buns, s’mores, i mean, it’s a freaking 7-11."
9469,Howard,yeah?
8005,Howard,fine.
10656,Howard,all by myself.
8678,Howard,done.
7383,Howard,"boy, what got him so upset?"
11146,Howard,see? this is what happens every time we work together.
8218,Howard,"you ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?"
10589,Howard,you guys ever notice sometimes bernadette sounds like my mom?
9430,Howard,"hey, guys, come on in."
8698,Howard,i miss you.
8114,Howard,"so, how’d the lecture go?"
10467,Howard,"so, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?"
6364,Howard,we liked leonard.
7272,Howard,i’m really going to miss you.
8127,Howard,"shh, shh. listen to me. i’m not gonna make it."
7544,Howard,it doesn’t mean any of that! it’s a typo.
11503,Howard,what is going on? did you upgrade his software last night?
6761,Howard,nice. cotton?
11011,Howard,bernie would love that.
8347,Howard,"congratulations, honey."
8691,Howard,the bird?
10372,Howard,i’m not answering that. it’s a trap.
7623,Howard,"if you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you’d have my great aunt ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied belgium in a cat."
7893,Howard,"what do you mean, whose fault was that?"
9993,Howard,"okay, good."
8674,Howard,i’m not signing a pre-nup.
6665,Howard,"sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?"
7016,Howard,"according to alicia’s facebook page, she’s hooking up with one of the producers on csi."
10895,Howard,"well, this is actually an interesting social experiment."
11346,Howard,"oh. well, hey, me, too."
10860,Howard,"no way. no, this is the room i associate the most with my mom."
11686,Howard,thank you.
8549,Howard,wild west and witches? what kind of loser cares about a showdown between billy the kid and the white wizard of the north?
11052,Howard,"i hope you don’t think i’m just saying this because it’s valentine’s day, but, i love you so much."
11844,Howard,you left something at home. a big hug.
10135,Howard,"well, what if we use our vacation time?"
9875,Howard,15 seconds.
11035,Howard,"fine. i had reservations about you, too."
10723,Howard,one more time?
8891,Howard,"okay, but i’m going to have to get it back from you so i can take it to the international space station. that way, when i come home, you will have a star that was actually in space."
7981,Howard,c-7.
11924,Howard,"excuse me. oh, damn. it’s my mother."
8148,Howard,what’s so funny?
10865,Howard,your dad’s on your side.
9544,Howard,mother? is that you? your little boy is coming home.
7809,Howard,is that steve wozniak?
8755,Howard,"hm, it’s no big deal."
6599,Howard,let her rip.
9294,Howard,son of a bitch.
10435,Howard,"okay. one, two, three."
9069,Howard,"then why are you trying to take this away from me? being an astronaut is the coolest thing i’m ever gonna do. if i stop talking about it, then i’m just…"
8313,Howard,"bernadette and i are getting married. ma? you too busy bearing down? ma?  son of a bitch! ma, help!"
6535,Howard,thy will be done. 
7247,Howard,what are you thinking? maybe a big musical number?
11518,Howard,"oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, i can do this. we have a plan. somebody please tell me the plan."
7628,Howard,i say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
10339,Howard,"bernie’s really excited. i could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling."
9266,Howard,what are we supposed to do?
11329,Howard,i was counting on that money. i need to make as much as my wife so i don’t have to try so hard in bed.
7009,Howard,"yeah, what’s the occasion?"
7120,Howard,"well, they’ve deployed our solution. let’s just all hope it works."
10002,Howard,you ready to talk about it?
7539,Howard,let me show you another way to look at this. here we have the universe of all women. these are the ones you want to sleep with. these are the women who believe exactly what you believe. these are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. and right there in the
10508,Howard,"well, i think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they’d never say to your face."
8231,Howard,okay.
8555,Howard,very.
6235,Howard,that was absolutely humiliating.
11472,Howard,"oh, did you meet her at work?"
7304,Howard,"come on, i’m smart, i have good job and i have only three percent body fat."
10461,Howard,"buddy, trust me, you don’t want to convert to judaism. i mean, i know i make it look cool, but it’s not all briskets and dreidels."
8563,Howard,"hey, we’re here to support you, buddy."
11682,Howard,"oh, she’s sexy, she can cook. i’m such a lucky guy."
7511,Howard,what? no.
8667,Howard,"you know what, it’s not a big deal. she makes more money than me. she wants to protect her financial interests. it’s completely reasonable."
8654,Howard,e.
7000,Howard,"penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives."
7530,Howard,sorry.
9371,Howard,"yeah, i know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. what are you and penny doing?"
10268,Howard,i’m always welcome.
10942,Howard,someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma.
11851,Howard,"okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?"
8161,Howard,look at us planning a future together.
8026,Howard,you got a better idea?
9549,Howard,"no, in a couple of weeks, stephen hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the north sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. one of their experimental physicists dropped out, and i recommended you."
6733,Howard,thank god for plan b.
7036,Howard,yes.
8968,Howard,nothing. everything’s fine.
11597,Howard,this thing’s pretty cool. it interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate.
8196,Howard,"well, honey, it’s not gonna do itself. oh, before i forget, tomorrow morning, you’re driving me to the dentist."
10683,Howard,it’s green.
10917,Howard,"i don’t know. i was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, i want some more."
8912,Howard,"so, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony."
11987,Howard,"i’m fine. be right out. am i an american hero? well, that’s a good question, jim. don’t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he’s a hero to all the nations of the earth? okey dokey. i think i have time for one more question."
11033,Howard,no. never.
7984,Howard,"oh, great, you made it. come on in. i invited her."
6879,Howard,"i understand that unlike leonard, they’re at the top of their respective fields."
8323,Howard,you can’t take that personally.
11889,Howard,if i push any harder i’m going to give birth to my colon. 
9778,Howard,thank god.
10616,Howard,"i’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?"
6903,Howard,it kind of does.
6587,Howard,"thanks, my mom made it. penny with a new guy, tres awkward."
8004,Howard,way to go shutting up.
9485,Howard,i can’t believe i have to explain this. people change names on blogs to protect their privacy. roger is raj.
9882,Howard,i can’t believe we’re not going.
10746,Howard,i’m not taking sides.
11720,Howard,he also never had sex in that room. that’s something else to look forward to.
8126,Howard,"raj, is that you?"
7374,Howard,remember this one? spider-man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. want me to get it for you? it’ll help take your mind off things.
7551,Howard,"oh, come on. so you were the victim of a crime. that’s part of life. when my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the lower east side of new york. you know what happened? every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. but, those people moved on, and so should you."
7518,Howard,"if it helps, we’re all good with your breasts."
8629,Howard,this is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter.
6464,Howard,"i’ll walk you to your car. you’re in structure 3 level c, right? "
7151,Howard,"okay, sheldon, sit down."
7873,Howard,"bernadette. she was so mad at me, she wouldn’t even listen to my side of the story."
11040,Howard,when are you gonna tell emily?
8429,Howard,is there any butter?
11553,Howard,what happened 
6960,Howard,"i will, i’m just working on my opening line."
7323,Howard,okay… puppies? where do you stand on puppies?
6287,Howard,so who wants to rent fiddler?
9822,Howard,"i’m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. sorry, i thought we’re saying things that are never gonna happen."
9201,Howard,can you believe this guy?
9123,Howard,"oh, you silly doodlebug."
7619,Howard,why do you want a jet ski?
8855,Howard,"th-they did. but nasa really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they’re putting me on an earlier launch."
9288,Howard,"look, leonard, there’s a bridge. drive off it."
10367,Howard,why? your father barely speaks to your mother.
9010,Howard,all right. woman hasn’t tied her robe in 20 years. suddenly she’s not decent?
8081,Howard,"well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, i’d say about a million dollars a pop."
9776,Howard,that’s why i sit.
7084,Howard,"cut the crap, you set this up, didn’t you?"
8662,Howard,isn’t that just feynman’s idea?
10969,Howard,ready to go?
8539,Howard,"so, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of amy. she’s kind of upset."
9377,Howard,"she hid my xbox like i’m a child. yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don’t give it back, i’m telling."
7895,Howard,really?
9387,Howard,we’re worried about you.
10712,Howard,"well, i’m not flying it."
7378,Howard,i didn’t know you were upset about that.
9488,Howard,"oh, i think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when i put up that camera."
8275,Howard,yeah. i just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.
8455,Howard,do you hear yourself
9149,Howard,"when i was starting to do magic in junior high, i thought i could be an escape artist like harry houdini."
8878,Howard,"um, okay."
9404,Howard,"come on, if i was any good at convincing women to do stuff, i wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower."
21709,Howard,you’re not going with us.
8591,Howard,"yeah, so?"
8428,Howard,"oh, wow. so you guys are getting along?"
6497,Howard,can you just let us in.
9233,Howard,i’ve never even been fishing. this is gonna be a disaster.
10899,Howard,"well, if she can solve them, it’ll prove she’s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a saturday night."
11696,Howard,"i know, i wish there was some way we could help him."
6372,Howard,go away. 
11757,Howard,"the terrible part is, ever since then, i’ve been sending bernie christmas cards from trixie."
6926,Howard,"you know, there’s kind of an obvious solution here.  nobody cares where you’re going to sit. you’re not crazy."
9712,Howard,doing what?
10364,Howard,"knock, knock."
11941,Howard,"okay, the good news is, we have a wonder woman."
6536,Howard,pees hep me! 
10124,Howard,i’m proud of us.
11451,Howard,why is it taking so long?
8992,Howard,whee! whee!
6512,Howard,can’t you play him some other time?
8113,Howard,"well, picture the hindenburg meets chernobyl meets three mile island meets tron 2."
7005,Howard,"yeah, i thought about renting this apartment, but i’m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy."
10398,Howard,"ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. we could start with basic cryptanalysis."
10338,Howard,she and amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.
6809,Howard,thanks for the heads up.
6299,Howard,"every year at comic con. every day at disneyland you can hire snow white to come to your house. course they prefer it if you have a kid, but… "
11302,Howard,it’s not nonsense. this is how the u.s. military works.
10768,Howard,"actually, we’re not going to the movies. we are here to kidnap you."
7859,Howard,"now, you see, i don’t know if you’re kidding or not."
10862,Howard,i guess we didn’t use it very often. unless we had company. which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…
11905,Howard,i know. it’s funny when it’s not happening to us.
8074,Howard,"it means after we play handball, i’m showering at home."
7364,Howard,"good. i’m glad. oh, man. did you see the way she smiled at me?"
10620,Howard,nope.
11724,Howard,"if you ever want to change things up, you’re always welcome here."
9106,Howard,"she did not burp me. she was patting me on the back, and i happened to burp. don’t you have other tables you should be waiting on?"
6588,Howard,are you saying that you’ve been holding back?
8163,Howard,i was out with bernadette.
10379,Howard,"anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another."
11468,Howard,"okay, last question. the chaps he was wearing, assless?"
10892,Howard,"he’s right, he knows a lot of jokes."
8866,Howard,"how about that. anyway, sir, i need to talk to you about something."
10818,Howard,really? remember when you were gonna get circumcised for rachel bernstein?
11262,Howard,we’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.
11562,Howard,bernie?
11888,Howard,i agree.
10552,Howard,"okay, let me see the damage."
10416,Howard,"well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it."
6953,Howard,"sheldon, let me explain to you how this works."
9968,Howard,i really don’t think we do tha…
6607,Howard,"yes, you are."
6482,Howard,you want to go again? let’s go. 
9880,Howard,damn.
10159,Howard,"come on, you don’t think it’s a little odd?"
7011,Howard,yum. starving.
11585,Howard,mm. i hope she has the same amount of sex in it i did. none. next square.
11600,Howard,try another one.
10319,Howard,how’d you get that?
8339,Howard,and are you?
11922,Howard,what are you asking me for? i don’t know if you can talk now or not.
6357,Howard,no.
6477,Howard,who are you to decide that?
8216,Howard,is that your card?
10807,Howard,thor versus indiana jones? you just blew my filking mind.
6925,Howard,yes!
9681,Howard,should i go after you?
10629,Howard,"not really. this guy shows up out of the blue, and now i have a brother? my father has another family?"
9364,Howard,it’s too late. we’ll see him at his bar mitzvah.
10381,Howard,thank you. and i love that you’re strong and independent.
9679,Howard,"oh, wow. yeah, no, i get that. i’m so sorry. starting tomorrow, i am turning over a new leaf. time with you is my number one priority."
6805,Howard,"please, leonard, not now. once again, penny and i have begun our little tango."
11172,Howard,yeah. anywhere you want.
11178,Howard,i didn’t know you needed help running errands today.
11735,Howard,"uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?"
7171,Howard,"if y’all don’t mind, i got a hankerin’ for a lone star beer."
9727,Howard,"well, last week was a blast. plus, i thought you might like having a guy here. "
8677,Howard,"why don’t i talk to your dad, man-to-man?"
7375,Howard,"no, i mean, she’s obviously way out of line."
10864,Howard,hey. what’s going on?
6303,Howard,are we ready on the stereo? 
8808,Howard,"well, then why are you always ripping on me?"
10156,Howard,it’s not that precious.
7992,Howard,what?
11309,Howard,he’s flashing his lights. what’s that mean?
8862,Howard,we can only hope… that he doesn’t.
11728,Howard,"well, at least someone had the courage to say it."
10456,Howard,maybe you need to do something more productive.
7690,Howard,i parked my scooter down the block.
11779,Howard,"me i get, but that sloth is pretty cute."
9166,Howard,i have to know!
9843,Howard,"if you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people."
10782,Howard,it’s the tyre.
8768,Howard,out!
9710,Howard,"ever since i met you, you turned my world around. you’re my best friend and my lover. we’re like changing electric and magnetic fields. you can’t have one without the other. i couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that i met you, bernadette."
9420,Howard,"bernie, i’m home. you have fun today?"
8239,Howard,"oh, that’s too bad. figure out the magic trick yet?"
11350,Howard,"well, maybe. i don’t know. we’ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week."
8266,Howard,"next time we go to kick someone’s ass, we take the train."
9915,Howard,there’s a car with a glass roof. want to go look at the stars?
11699,Howard,sure. this is for you.
8608,Howard,"yeah, we’re good."
10542,Howard,those are business expenses. you can write those off.
9255,Howard,"really? thank you, sir."
8686,Howard,it’s numbered.
11252,Howard,hey. where is everybody?
10157,Howard,or in her neck. listen. you staying here seems like something she would’ve talked to me about.
11705,Howard,you want to let him live here?
11153,Howard,scientifically? a little over a year ago. legos? last week in my room.
8468,Howard,and she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
7119,Howard,"yes, sir, i understand classified. we’ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me."
9281,Howard,"wait, you got called in, too? what is going on?"
8098,Howard,probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.
11489,Howard,what’s the big deal?
8695,Howard,you read it as oh eight hundred.
11197,Howard,thanks for understanding.
9761,Howard,"maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. she should quiet down soon. i gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her."
7915,Howard,i think she likes you.
