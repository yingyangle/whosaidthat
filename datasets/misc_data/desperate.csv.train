3430,Bree,"mmm. ohh. mwah. well, you deserve some credit, too. i mean, you brought us peter's business."
94,Bree,"for what, zach?"
1035,Bree,"i'm not refusing anything. all i'm saying is stay away from phyllis. she's a, she's a raving loon."
3335,Bree,"not a good time, orson."
1434,Bree,"oh,well,where does she live?"
2921,Bree,there. you have your answer. now sit.
130,Bree,and we think that you should have it.
1632,Bree,no one is ever gonna believe a word of that.
4006,Bree,then again--m.j. does--love my macaroons.
3621,Bree,i'm a caterer. i oversee events on thanksgiving. it's the one holiday that i don't need.
3003,Bree,"here's the thing you need to understand about me and my friends. we each have our niche. gabrielle's the glamorous one. susan's the adorable one. lynette's smart. edie's--edie. and i'm the domestic one, the organizer--the one who knows that there are three tines on a dessert fork. i'm the one who gets teased for that. that's who i am. and that's also who you are."
1328,Bree,"ah, i'm not sure."
3134,Bree,"okay. well, what's going on?"
2319,Bree,"yes, i know--with monique polier."
3510,Bree,"and this is my own little kitchen. i'm pretty sure my husband's here somewhere. orson, dear, are you decent?"
251,Bree,i'm repairing a chipped mug.
3944,Bree,"lynette, thank you again for driving."
530,Bree,"you know what? at our next settlement talks, i plan on asking for your golf clubs!"
3227,Bree,"no. uh, mr. van de kamp is deceased."
625,Bree,why would you say that?
1874,Bree,"well, that was-- very sweet."
3728,Bree,thank god i didn't show her how the car parks itself.
1220,Bree,exactly. you're a mother trying to protect her child. it's a natural impulse.
2682,Bree,"oh, well, thank you. orson and i would be delighted."
1582,Bree,"because,sweetheart,it is my job to teach you about responsibility,setting goals,delayed gratification."
1245,Bree,"i am taking my champagne and my aging eggs, and i'm going home."
3045,Bree,"edie, would you do me a favor and take orson back to his apartment? i have to let my sitter go home."
3230,Bree,orson! did you get my message about linda flanagan?
1400,Bree,hi!
1941,Bree,that is so adorable but i don't think i can eat another bite.
1118,Bree,george.
3081,Bree,yeah.
2116,Bree,"andrew, would you be a dear and make sure your sister's just breaking her own things? anyway--hmm. tish atherton--"
3165,Bree,then he raised the gun and came toward us. thank god katherine grabbed his arm and got the gun away. that lunatic would've killed us all.
3256,Bree,"please, just don't take him! benjamin's all i have!"
1383,Bree,"well, the good news is he's, he's dead."
1057,Bree,no.
2853,Bree,i can only imagine. i had to listen to her babble for an hour.
2171,Bree,what is all this?
2858,Bree,the fire captain said they have to go slowly. they don't want debris suddenly collapsing into the basement.
2393,Bree,he's not sleeping. he's out cold.
476,Bree,thank you. i did too.
3390,Bree,"oh, katherine, please."
2895,Bree,susan.
2547,Bree,of course! i love your charades parties. and i hope you're inviting that delightful katherine mayfair.
1333,Bree,"why don't you all take your seats? uh, dessert is about to be served."
2406,Bree,"orson, i know you're embarrassed, but what they did to you was a crime."
224,Bree,"oh, really. like what?"
2282,Bree,it's not that easy. i love him.
3092,Bree,i know no such thing. now be quiet. i'm done talking to you.
3385,Bree,"andrew, really."
1278,Bree,"so we're gonna go to my house. i made banana bread, and we'll put on a fresh pot, and just talk about anything."
528,Bree,you only demanded the good china because you know i love it.
2940,Bree,psst! not you. lynette.
3596,Bree,i am gonna handle everything for this wedding.
3928,Bree,"that jail is--it's disgusting. all those men in cages, like animals. even to step foot in that place is humiliating."
3724,Bree,"look, there's even a refrigerator. the lexus dealer said there's just enough room for a split of champagne and two chilled glasses. and the best thing is, it's a hybrid so you can barely hear it. let me show you."
3186,Bree,"oh, don't be silly. i may have based a few on your recipes, but i always changed something."
3632,Bree,ah! here you are.
3493,Bree,"mike. yes, indeedy."
568,Bree,valentine's day is tomorrow.
1069,Bree,"that's why i need you to take the test and answer the detective's questions, because i'm not going to know exactly how i feel until we put this behind us, but then, once we do--"
1524,Bree,hi.i'm bree.i live down the street.i'm a friend of your mother's.
1230,Bree,"see, george, um, the thing is--"
3063,Bree,i'm bree hodge.
3274,Bree,"well, what happens next year when he overtakes you?"
1727,Bree,"well,actually they can.i mean,it's their money to dispense with as they see fit.i know it doesn't seem fair,but--"
2389,Bree,hi. sorry. my book club ran late. didn't orson make you dinner?
2295,Bree,"they found monique's blood on the wrench that mike was trying to dispose of. i mean, that hardly screams innocence."
466,Bree,i'm packing up your father's things for when he eventually moves out.
1751,Bree,"well, i have been doing some thinking and--here's a thought--why don't i be your sponsor?"
837,Bree,what?
28,Bree,what's that supposed to mean?
4010,Bree,"oh, no. deep down, he's just a fragile little boy who wants to be liked."
624,Bree,yes. well -
1101,Bree,"george, i can't allow you to discipline my child if you won't even tell me what he did."
3811,Bree,don't be ridiculous. tom's rudeness does not give you license to steal. return it immediately.
3595,Bree,"oh, my goodness, are you two--"
1586,Bree,"oh,okay.are you a friend of andrew's?"
122,Bree,i spoke to brian's mother. now tell me again where you were last night and this time don't lie to me.
518,Bree,i don't think you're pathetic. it's just that--i can't.
994,Bree,"i am not cold. i just, well, i don't like public displays of emotion."
2467,Bree,"well,not if we're careful."
1545,Bree,"oh. in that case,why don't you bring me another bottle of the pinot grigio?and please hurry."
2997,Bree,used to be. not anymore. things change.
2115,Bree,the oddest thing happened at the club today. tish atherton--
3482,Bree,"orson, don't cramp the boy's style."
2967,Bree,"yes, of course. why wouldn't it?"
3526,Bree,wonderful. the house was too quiet without him.
3974,Bree,"well, it's wonderful to have you home. how's your head?"
3195,Bree,"katherine, i'm sure your wrist is just fine."
3759,Bree,excuse me.
2304,Bree,"no, i wasn't. they arrested mike for the murder of monique polier."
3577,Bree,i'm just trying to understand how my son could keep a secret like this from his own mother.
683,Bree,you know we are just lucky that that security guard did not press charges.
3429,Bree,"well, katherine's been lonely, so i set her up with a client, and he's been there for over four hours, so you know it's going well!"
2450,Bree,there. now you have something new.
2272,Bree,"there were two women in your life before me. one vanished, and the other was killed. that's all i need to understand. i've packed some of your things. i want you out of the house. now."
3026,Bree,what are you talking about?
2761,Bree,i swear to you before god that this child will be as devout a jew as i am.
120,Bree,"well, i want to talk to you."
4118,Bree,"andrew, honey, hurry up. dinner's ready."
3539,Bree,"this is absolutely necessary. i am going through a very stressful time. i have interviews, that cooking demonstration at the mall. if i don't get my rest, it could affect the launch of my book."
3019,Bree,"i sympathize. i do, but i have a new baby, and it's really more work than i care to take on right now."
539,Bree,"george, would you like to join me for a dreadful cup of coffee?"
3819,Bree,great. i'll call bruce this afternoon.
1095,Bree,i can't believe how well those two are getting along.
2974,Bree,"well--if you have a different idea, i would love to hear that, too."
2004,Bree,"clearly, i do."
1765,Bree,yes.why would you wanna come to a place like this?
555,Bree,all i know is this: mary alice loved zach more than anything in the world. when you love a child that much--
1173,Bree,"how are we going to do that, george? you have just given me hives."
60,Bree,"yes, well, i feel badly about that."
236,Bree,you're dining alone?
3037,Bree,and you'd probably go to prison.
14,Bree,you'd rather i serve pork and beans?
659,Bree,thank you.
2465,Bree,"oh,andrew,i'm having problems with my strap.could you help me?"
868,Bree,"george, do you have an erection?"
820,Bree,yes. and bring ginger.
3979,Bree,enjoy your tea.
1836,Bree,"somebody ruined your cake,and i wanna know who could be that thoughtless."
1067,Bree,"but according to the polygraph, that wasn't exactly true."
3871,Bree,"after i told you to stay out of the neighbors' houses? you stole again, didn't you?"
3663,Bree,"what exactly are you saying, alex?"
240,Bree,"no, i don't."
3506,Bree,check and check.
503,Bree,"okay. now when you're firing a semi-automatic, you want the web of your hand all the way up against the edge of the back strap."
174,Bree,"honey, the marriage counselling might not work out, you need to get used to bad cooking."
3550,Bree,whatever.
2108,Bree,"yes, i know. she's my daughter. my 17-year-old daughter."
442,Bree,"not that it's any of your business, but, i have a date."
2898,Bree,"walter, wait!"
3840,Bree,you took it. i saw you.
62,Bree,bye.
1,Bree,"paul, zachary."
2100,Bree,why?
4112,Bree,"as of this moment, rex, i am no longer your wife. i am going to go out, and find the most vindictive lawyer i can find, and together, we are going to eviscerate you. i'm going to take away your money, your family, and your dignity. do you hear me?"
1148,Bree,to rex's grave site.
296,Bree,"rex, you need to come home. something's happened, and we need you."
572,Bree,"well, it's just that i know that i don't please you sexually, so i was wondering if you really were looking forward to being with me."
1124,Bree,"he is not a corpse. he is a man named rex van de kamp. he was a loving husband, a devoted father, and a successful doctor. so successful, in fact, that he left me enough money to sue the city, this precinct, and you two gentlemen personally just for the fun of it."
857,Bree,"why don't we start doing things again, as a couple?"
769,Bree,it'll be fine.
3538,Bree,you don't have an uncle!
4082,Bree,"ah, but i never filed insurance crime."
2342,Bree,"oh, well, i'm afraid he's not here, but i will be happy to tell him that you came by."
3146,Bree,"yes? oh, there you are! where is my ice sculpture? no! no,6:00 is too late. i need it now. oh, forget it. i'll pick it up myself."
2176,Bree,edie said he's a bachelor--
2076,Bree,i'll never forgive myself. it's all my fault for pushing him away.
2047,Bree,how very saucy.
1137,Bree,"yes. this is rex. i, i want to thank you again for what you did. it was so refreshing to be treated with kindness after weeks of just ludicrous accusations."
985,Bree,who was that?
3371,Bree,promise me you'll never leave our bed again.
1913,Bree,i beg your pardon?
1860,Bree,please don't make excuses for him.that is exactly what his father does. rex!
445,Bree,"oh, right on time!"
4107,Bree,you're fired.
2140,Bree,"well, that hotel room was small, and you seemed happy enough there. oh, and i trust you to be discreet. you wouldn't want your wife find out about this and use it against you in your divorce."
3100,Bree,it has a very distinct ring.
206,Bree,uh?
654,Bree,i don't think it's asking that much. all you need to do is remove one little name.
3562,Bree,thank you for having me to your lovely home.
235,Bree,dr. goldfine.
3904,Bree,so you've said.
1216,Bree,"well,i'll just have to get over it,won't i?"
877,Bree,what is that supposed to mean?
309,Bree,they sure didn't turn out like we expected them to.
1630,Bree,"andrew,the judge is not seriously gonna believe that i beat you."
469,Bree,no. that his father's only human.
1189,Bree,i can't stay in a hotel room with you.
52,Bree,"what? oh, oh, oh no, thank you. i have some things that i, i need to do today."
2068,Bree,i cannot thank you enough for getting danielle interested in history. she has never worked so hard on a project before.
3351,Bree,"honey, i don't snore."
2824,Bree,did i do something wrong?
1671,Bree,"oh!well,good for you."
44,Bree,"hi, i'm bree, and this is my husband rex. and i brought you some homemade pot pourri."
2226,Bree,"orson, it's implied! now get out there and show her some respect!"
1211,Bree,"george. i know what you want from me, and i, i thought i wanted the same thing, but i keep getting those rashes because i still feel married."
1886,Bree,i committed myself voluntarily.
2111,Bree,"thank you, dear. danielle, you haven't touched your dinner."
3744,Bree,"oh, you can just put that on a hanger in the back. what i want is to make this an opportunity for you. we can turn one of your dismal thursday night seatings into a real event."
1924,Bree,"danielle, i don't know what you're planning, but i need to talk to you right now."
3105,Bree,"i did, but, um, i'm afraid it hasn't worked out. it's been rough."
2636,Bree,"she's not in switzerland. she's at the sisters of hope convent. look, phyllis, i'm sorry. i know this is upsetting."
1559,Bree,"oh,thank god! i'm so sorry.i don't know what happened.i was in the kitchen cleaning up after making cookies,and i looked in the living room,and they were gone."
3962,Bree,"hello, my love."
1615,Bree,"i know you think i'm kidding myself,but i'm not.i'm nothing like you people.i just don't have a compulsive personality."
2911,Bree,damn right.
627,Bree,"hello, john. i'm sorry to drop by on you, unannounced. do you have a moment?"
1634,Bree,"hi,it's bree van de kamp.i didn't know who else to call,and,well,i'm in a bit of a situation."
231,Bree,"oh, i take it you've met maisy gibbons."
1680,Bree,"oh,hello."
3117,Bree,oh! aah! oh.
1161,Bree,"uh, no, go ahead."
3395,Bree,and she'll be twice as mad at having been put in that position. i am not telling her tonight.
785,Bree,"andrew, come here, i want you to see this."
342,Bree,"a woman is in a coma, because of andrew. and there he is, happy as a clam!"
492,Bree,this is a 9-mm luger po8!
1561,Bree,no--no harm done.
2695,Bree,"lynette, i was just thinking about you. did you get your test results yet?"
1603,Bree,"you know,the opposite of love isn't hate.it's indifference.and if you hate me,that means you still care,and we're still connected,and i still have a chance to set you right."
1900,Bree,"oh, it's not for me, it's for danielle. that hair is going back to the color god intended."
135,Bree,"no, he won't. just act normal."
1165,Bree,oh!
2821,Bree,an educated guess.
2784,Bree,"and if you're as tired as you say you are, then you're bound to sleep better tonight."
3150,Bree,aah! help me! help!
641,Bree,i can see that tisha is making the rounds. she must have some juicy new anecdote.
1563,Bree,"well,you know how boys are at the age.they're escape artists."
1616,Bree,is this libby's real hair color?
3998,Bree,"yes, i know that comes as a surprise."
3653,Bree,yeah! let's do that.
4044,Bree,was it florence?
2044,Bree,"excuse me, ma'am? i mean-- miss. i'm looking for someone. uh, his name is andrew. have you seen him?"
3388,Bree,"when orson left, i--began having a glass of white wine now and then. then when danielle took benjamin, i didn't see any reason to stop at just one."
345,Bree,"well, he's doing a fabulous job!"
2825,Bree,"katherine, are you all right? i- i couldn't help noticing-"
4111,Bree,what just happened?
3492,Bree,"yes, in the, uh, test kitchen."
2356,Bree,"no! i mean--i mean, no, alma, you can't buy this house."
2855,Bree,"she said he had a tattoo on his shoulder, which i know isn't true because i've seen him at the pool, and i would've remembered 'cause tattooed people make me very uncomfortable."
755,Bree,"he blames me for his being here. he blames me for everything, and he's probably right."
898,Bree,"couldn't sleep, so i was just sitting here thinking."
1649,Bree,so how are you doing?
1250,Bree,"well, for starters, he knows the last thing i'd ever want to do is have more children."
2614,Bree,excuse me?
2687,Bree,are you insane?
2062,Bree,"a reporter just did a story on homeless teens, my son is one of them."
333,Bree,she'll be fine. what do you think's happening with lynette?
2581,Bree,good idea.
4109,Bree,"andrew, this is your mother. i am rapidly reaching the end of my patience with you. where are you? are you at a bar? andrew? andrew?"
4103,Bree,"my beef is that from the minute i walked into this office, you have pulled me deeper and deeper into your moral cesspool. that is not why i hired you."
3711,Bree,i'll learn. and i want it to be more than just a cookbook. i want to talk about traditional values and give helpful hints about homemaking.
519,Bree,"oh, george, please don't go!"
652,Bree,i have some money that i've been putting aside for emergencies. it can be all yours if you just--
320,Bree,we should probably be going.
1612,Bree,"okay, you got me.i'm not really an alcoholic."
546,Bree,yes.
2351,Bree,"oh, make no mistake, our friendship is over."
32,Bree,"it's a letter, addressed to mary alice."
307,Bree,"i had just been--thinking about the kids. they sure grew up quickly, didn't they?"
1800,Bree,"there's so many things i wanna say to you,andrew.but mostly,i just want you to know how sorry i am."
709,Bree,there's this place called camp hennessey. it's designed for teenagers like yourself who have lost their way and--
2500,Bree,"well,would that be so horrible?"
1298,Bree,i think it's time for you to leave.
2484,Bree,surely not over food.
1891,Bree,you let go of me right now!
3849,Bree,"oh, dear. what happened?"
2568,Bree,it is?
2382,Bree,"well, we have to do something."
3813,Bree,"now that you brought it up, lynette, i've been feeling just awful about the way i took over your restaurant and insulted you and--what can i say?"
1575,Bree,"okay,take care."
344,Bree,"well, maybe if we take it away from him, then he'll start to understand what he did! he has not shown an ounce of remorse since the accident."
3835,Bree,but what about the job?
155,Bree,"but, wait, what about the tape? she did say that her name was angela."
326,Bree,"honey, you put a woman into a coma. surely that arouses some kind of emotion!"
1276,Bree,"hi, honey."
671,Bree,"gabrielle, is everything okay?"
4105,Bree,"no, i haven't."
674,Bree,"are you and carlos having some sort of money trouble? gabby, it's okay if you are."
1478,Bree,"i just thought you should know that i came home to find your son hiding underneath my daughter's bed,and it just seems to me that--"
713,Bree,"stop it. honey, no matter what you say or do, i will always love you."
952,Bree,"thank you. that's just a huge weight off my shoulders. oh, these are for you."
3999,Bree,"karl, if we move forward, i will insist you handle our divorce with dignity."
2253,Bree,"orson, what if something should happen to her?"
537,Bree,hi! wha-what are you doing here?
457,Bree,"andrew, where did you come from?"
355,Bree,"andrew, can i come in?"
3377,Bree,i'd rather you not talk about the job tonight.
1809,Bree,i think it's gonna be a kick having susan and julie stay with us.it'll be like living in a sorority.we'll stay up late and we'll gossip and make s'mores.doesn't that sound like fun?
3168,Bree,"oh, for god sakes. what's wrong now?"
1844,Bree,"um,you can just--leave that there,and i'll, um--clean it up later."
438,Bree,"yes, i think it would be fun."
2787,Bree,"no, thanks. i'm just dropping off andrew's cell phone. he forgot it again."
412,Bree,they sure did.
970,Bree,"i left him an hour ago, and he was wearing ralph lauren."
2796,Bree,"mmm, yes, you do. i'm mrs. zimmerman."
4007,Bree,"well, hello there, m.j. i was baking this morning, and like an idiot, i made too many macaroons. would you be willing to take one? i would hate to see them go to waste."
3324,Bree,"orson, we're partners. we share everything. any success i have is just as much yours as it is mine."
1820,Bree,"yeah. i just wasn't tired.oh, i wanna show you what else i've planned.i think you're gonna love it."
3634,Bree,hi! what have you two been up to?
3460,Bree,can you believe it? a thief and a pothead!
1466,Bree,"well,that's good to hear,because most people on this street couldn't keep a secret if their lives depended on it."
2125,Bree,"this was a cry for help, and if we don't listen, the next time she could do something even more dangerous."
1127,Bree,"detective barton, you are clearly a gentleman."
3239,Bree,chives! how could i forget chives?
1600,Bree,"because i'm not done with you yet.it's my job to teach you,and you are not half the mani know you can be."
3775,Bree,"i knew. i just thought if they'd tasted mine, they might change the rules."
3206,Bree,"yes, it is."
2141,Bree,"mr. faladi, if you want to break my daughter's heart, i can't stop you, but i will not be an accomplice. you'll tell her yourself."
1490,Bree,"well, how about some old-fashioned chaperoning?that way they can, um,still see each other,and we won't have to be the villains."
1723,Bree,"oh,dad,andrew hates labels.i'm sure it's just a phase."
1203,Bree,"oh. well, okay."
2403,Bree,your drink was laced with pills for--erectile dysfunction.
2478,Bree,"well,hello,mrs.mckeever."
317,Bree,"well, more importantly, is there any good news about juanita?"
414,Bree,i have. i was so afraid you were gonna die. there were so many things i haven't had a chance to tell you.
2322,Bree,sour cream.
3625,Bree,fine! i call easter.
909,Bree,"no, you're not."
2348,Bree,"boy, when it comes to mike there's no one you won't betray."
37,Bree,"it's the age-old question, isn't it? how much do we really wanna know about our neighbours?"
2961,Bree,"well, if you ever wanna try us again--"
3216,Bree,"well, um, michelle downing asked me to speak to you. i don't know if you heard, but i'm catering her birthday party"
1208,Bree,did i do anything embarrassing? sometimes i snore.
1170,Bree,"oh, ah, ah, it's starting to spread to my face."
3387,Bree,i'm too tired. can you do it?
343,Bree,i think we should make him quit the swim team.
3739,Bree,"lynette, hi. oh, i wish i had time for a chat, but i'm on my way to a meeting. i might design my own line of bakeware. can you imagine?"
1932,Bree,--to see who you really are--
3592,Bree,i hear the gym is a popular meeting place.
1089,Bree,"honey, the feelings that you're having are perfectly normal, but george isn't trying to take your father's place. he's, well, he's just a friend."
1721,Bree,"oh,dad,i-i forgot to warn you.these are some of andrew's adult videos.i don't approve,but boys will be boys."
1246,Bree,"george, i'm starting to think that we made a mistake rushing into this engagement."
874,Bree,"i kept this friendship going because i though rex's dislike of you was paranoid, but you had feelings for me all along. god, this is just such a betrayal."
3236,Bree,and because it was the right thing to do. i just didn't know then that i would be a public figure someday. but i am. i have a name now.
1887,Bree,"i don't need that much help, because i am not like your other patients."
3147,Bree,"why don't you fill water glasses? that's an important job, too."
1943,Bree,"no, no, um, i do.it just that i, um, can't help being cautious, since rex i haven't been exactly lucky in love."
2522,Bree,that's hers!
1086,Bree,"i don't care. here, put this on. every time you leave this house, you represent this family. and the least you can do is not humiliate us."
1724,Bree,"maybe not,but it's no longer my concern now that he'll be living with you."
4106,Bree,"what? karl--if i have not been clear about how i feel about you, i apologize for any ambiguity. understand this--i detest you."
1407,Bree,i shouldn't have said anything.
3021,Bree,"yeah, sure. you know, i don't really think it's fair that you should profit from something that i designed."
614,Bree,"as a matter of fact it does, and just so we're clear, if you get lisa pregnant, you will marry her."
3912,Bree,is that the visitors' room?
2779,Bree,so you'll replace it for free.
1177,Bree,"dr. goldfine, rex is dead. you can't cheat on a corpse."
3855,Bree,a thrill? stealing a ceramic duck gives you a thrill?
3879,Bree,"really? and--and yet he keeps charging me. so, doctor, what's this ""revelation"" that you've been keeping from me for $200 an hour?"
2509,Bree,"oh, no need, dear. i always bring dessert. oh, i'm thinking my lemon meringue pie."
4023,Bree,"you are repugnant, and this conversation is over."
3439,Bree,that is not funny! i have to go warn katherine.
947,Bree,"well, um, he's being buried in a blue suit."
786,Bree,your baby pictures. look at that one.
2912,Bree,"i am sorry, but i have to make sure that he doesn't let her chair that committee."
3494,Bree,let's not dwell on it.
1962,Bree,"okay, so we will see you saturday and please pretend to be surprised.bye."
421,Bree,that's - between your father and me.
2524,Bree,what? surrender? debase myself?
2218,Bree,"well, how can he feel that way? you're his mother."
1821,Bree,"no, relax.he's a very hip juggler.he only performs to beatles songs,and i saw the video,and it's absolutely thrilling."
867,Bree,"come on, take your best -"
1690,Bree,that's your solution?
4060,Bree,"no, he thinks i filed it."
2585,Bree,i can't wait that long. i have to be with her.
3599,Bree,don't give me that. you've been whispering to each other all night. you obviously know alex. how?
3924,Bree,"what are you up to, edie?"
78,Bree,is there somebody you'd like to invite?
2642,Bree,then why did he always avoid you? why were you barely ever here?
4068,Bree,"orson, i'm home."
2919,Bree,what? no. put your hand down.
1175,Bree,"actually, i have not considered that because that's idiotic!"
468,Bree,there comes this point in every boy's life--
1520,Bree,"is that what you really think, danielle?i should go to mrs. applewhite, be nice,and then she'll hand over all her secrets?"
3060,Bree,i saw you kissing my husband.
1757,Bree,hello?
3189,Bree,"really, katherine. just because i let you execute a few eye-catching garnishes that gratify your need to show off, doesn't mean that i can't do them just as well myself."
1113,Bree,"george, what are you doing here?"
3164,Bree,we don't have much time before the police get here. we need to talk.
1280,Bree,"oh, honey, there's no reason why you and carlos can't try again."
871,Bree,you have got to get rid of it. there are children present.
375,Bree,"gabrielle, you have to change the lineup. susan has to go last. nothing is going to top this."
1566,Bree,"no!ah,you know,i may have had just the tiniest little bit of chardonnay."
3896,Bree,"well, i have a new idea. i'd like to wait."
3657,Bree,"orson, take it easy!"
1594,Bree,so that's what this is about--your trust fund?
86,Bree,"why? i'm your wife, you can say anything in front of me. all we need is a few more sessions, and i'm sure we can."
1849,Bree,"oh, no, i'm fine.i'm just tired, that's all.i just need a long rest,and then i'm gonna be as good as new."
450,Bree,"rex, say hello to george!"
3617,Bree,really? they say that?
3862,Bree,"oh, that's all right. i'll just go to the store."
2061,Bree,"yes, they are, aren't they?"
1442,Bree,"uh,no.i just wanted to ask you a favor."
3848,Bree,who are we dishing? i do hope it's not me.
1331,Bree,it was not a tiff! we broke up! it's over!
2810,Bree,"well, i know that."
1774,Bree,"yes.betty,i am serious.either you do something,or i will."
1461,Bree,"oh,for goodness sakes!"
3500,Bree,"fair enough. but just be careful, i mean, this is very complicated. i'd hate to see it end badly."
2759,Bree,"i would love that, but my husband orson --big, stubborn, goy. he says we should do nothing and let the child decide when he's grown. we don't pick our parents-- we should pick our religion?"
3096,Bree,"although i always, uh, like a trip to the range, is there any particular reason we came here for party planning?"
3097,Bree,"it's funny how having a man in the house can make you feel safer, no matter how retiring or easily spooked he might be."
3545,Bree,"you want honesty? fine. you didn't want to divorce mike. you hit a really bad patch after the accident, but you never stopped loving him. and why would you? your relationship didn't have a natural end. so face it. you're not mad at me or mike or katherine. you're mad at yourself for letting your marriage falls apart."
301,Bree,"it has to be, i don't want gabrielle and carlos coming home to this ugly reminder in front of their house."
1651,Bree,see?i think you can handle affection better than you give yourself credit for.
2969,Bree,good morning. what's going on?
657,Bree,i have fourteen thousand dollars in that account. it can all be yours.
2839,Bree,"hi, katherine. could i borrow adam for a second? i have a--situation on my hands."
3765,Bree,"well, i've always believed that we create our own luck."
2463,Bree,"oh, don't remind me."
3782,Bree,i like the way you think. what would we do without him?
2882,Bree,you know what else you two have in common? a love of boots.
1902,Bree,"they also get pregnant and become drug addicts, and that color hair is the gateway.would you please, uh, add that to our bill?"
2730,Bree,"i'd start saving your pennies. bonny briar's up to $10,000 a year."
226,Bree,and what would this sexual surrogate person do?
4100,Bree,don't be glib. did you hire someone to attack orson?
1776,Bree,--the courage to change the things we can--
1640,Bree,"tonight was a very unusual situation.i wish you could've known me when--rex was alive and my kids were young,and everything was--the way it was supposed to be.i think you really would've liked me-- so much."
3902,Bree,"orson, please come upstairs. i know what that couch does to your back."
161,Bree,so you want me to lie?
768,Bree,"andrew, i would love you even if you were a murderer."
3085,Bree,"i told them everything, edie, about orson, benjamin, everything."
3044,Bree,"no, it's a pathetic fantasy fueled by cowardice and amaretto sours. you committed a crime, orson. face it."
2468,Bree,"look,this family's reputation is already hanging by a thread.i mean,first people thought that your stepfather was a wife killer,then your sister takes up with her history teacher,and now we're supposed to parade a little bastard up and down the street.we might as well sit on the porch and play banjos."
4124,Bree,"i don't think it was the wine, george. i think it was the antihistamines."
501,Bree,"two, high hand grasp. three, hard grip. four, front sight. five, release the safety, and then squeeze the trigger slowly."
4116,Bree,andrew.
2764,Bree,orson.
3495,Bree,i said..let's not dwell on it.
404,Bree,"well, that depends. are you having an affair with my husband?"
1451,Bree,"oh,you can't be serious."
1374,Bree,yeah. they found data in george's personal computer and also records at his pharmacy that pretty much proves that he was poisoning your father.
3520,Bree,"oh, dear god. this woman is determined to make my life sound ten times worse than it actually is."
493,Bree,"i can't accept this, george! this is an antique. it's too valuable."
3645,Bree,yes. a good opportunity for andrew to commute five hours to his job.
2202,Bree,i'm sure she won't mind. come on. let's go. come on.
924,Bree,and do you know why i save it for last?
2562,Bree,"in your condition, that's what you should be doing. and where on earth did you get skates in a convent?"
401,Bree,"um, excuse me, i'm here to see rex van de kamp. apparently, he had a heart attack. i'm not sure when -"
2945,Bree,i am not! my friend's just a little confused. she forgot that she's presbyterian and wandered into the wrong church.
747,Bree,i wanted to wear andrew's favourite colour. then i realised that i don't know what it is.
2159,Bree,no! i have no idea. what?
2739,Bree,is everything okay?
3574,Bree,he helped you through a very difficult time. the least we can do is let him know how much we appreciate--what the hell is this?
1272,Bree,"well, maybe susan, lynette, and i have had a good influence on you."
1049,Bree,yes.
1855,Bree,i think i'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
245,Bree,it sure is nice and toasty in here.
2798,Bree,"hello, adam."
2464,Bree,"yes,but the good news is she's gonna live."
3522,Bree,"spare me your ""darling,"" sandra. i know you've been trying to dig up dirt on me."
383,Bree,i could ask you the same question.
1662,Bree,"of course not.i just want you to understand something.andrew is making accusations--false accusations,saying that i abused him,all because i wouldn't let him have his trust fund early so he could buy a car.i mean,can you blame me for wanting to know if i have your support?"
3762,Bree,"fine. i'll reimburse you, if that'll make things right."
3077,Bree,how did you--
2981,Bree,katherine--
3507,Bree,"only that her name is sandra birch. we just spoke, and she seemed very nice."
1190,Bree,because i am starting to get that rash again.
3515,Bree,"now, um, may i pour you some more tea?"
3184,Bree,really? what?
2193,Bree,"oh, it's just awful. deviled egg?"
2567,Bree,she's not here?
1933,Bree,#name?
1665,Bree,hi.
3884,Bree,that's not true!
1993,Bree,"yeah, don't you think it will be gorgeous with my coloring?"
2497,Bree,and then what would happen to the baby?
3809,Bree,really?
3480,Bree,"okay, this is not a joke. my book comes out next month--my old-fashioned, traditional cookbook! this could ruin me!"
862,Bree,"okay, okay, i'll be good."
105,Bree,i didn't have time to make an appointment. rex moved out today.
1424,Bree,"oh, don't worry.i won't start garnishing your wages until you turn 18."
3763,Bree,what's that supposed to mean?
3620,Bree,"wait, wait, wait. this is not how we decide family get-togethers."
3332,Bree,just give me a sec.
3028,Bree,what?
2352,Bree,"alma! i-i didn't know that, uh, you knew edie."
1037,Bree,"my husband died of a heart attack. i loved him very deeply, and your mother did a lousy job."
504,Bree,"uh, i'm not wearing perfume."
2427,Bree,"susan, stop. mike is innocent. he had nothing to do with monique polier's murder."
817,Bree,ginger? the stock girl?
1650,Bree,oh.
2773,Bree,"this isn't just for me and benjamin. this will help you bond with him, too."
639,Bree,"what's wrong, rex? didn't you enjoy your golf game with dr. wallace?"
3277,Bree,that's your mom way back when she was your age.
2168,Bree,"oh, i'd love to."
1542,Bree,i didn't have to.he committed suicide.
478,Bree,"yeah, and i would rather cut off my hand than hurt his feelings."
116,Bree,he got a last minute call to speak at a medical conference in philadelphia. take your seats.
3927,Bree,"oh, well, my schedule is just unreal, what with the catering company and looking after benjamin."
2797,Bree,i was in a very naughty mood when i left that.
177,Bree,is your father here? we were scheduled to do a patrol today.
3635,Bree,did edie show you the adams house?
405,Bree,he said that?
3519,Bree,why?
2359,Bree,"don't worry, alma, i'm sure that, uh, edie can find you a house that won't give you nightmares."
467,Bree,"andrew, i'm so sorry that i said anything."
2377,Bree,"uh, yes, i need to speak to my husband. yes, there is. could you please ask him to come home as early as possible tonight? thank you."
2276,Bree,what are you watching?
3322,Bree,so you've been pretending to go to work for three weeks?
1036,Bree,"you want a statement? fine, i'll give you a statement."
1493,Bree,do you remember the man they arrested--the one that broke into gabrielle's and escaped from the mental hospital?he's there.i saw him in their window.they're hiding him.
2101,Bree,you're awful.
2174,Bree,"well, somebody just bought her old house. maybe that triggered something."
2977,Bree,"well, perhaps i could try something new. let's go with the lisianthus."
2860,Bree,"edie, if you say that to lynette, so help me god, i will wring your neck."
742,Bree,"oh, i had to spank him. alright i will re-raise."
3072,Bree,"strictly speaking, you're not even related to him. i mean, it was fine for you to masquerade as his father when we were together, but now that we're not--"
234,Bree,you play poker?
3875,Bree,"you'll see when he leaves, and your lamp is missing."
1291,Bree,"uh, yes, i think so, mr. williams."
3587,Bree,"well, i just want you to know, if you need to scootch, alex, i am okay with scootching and--the rest of it."
30,Bree,"susan, are you alright? you look awful."
993,Bree,excuse me?
2173,Bree,is this why you apologized?
851,Bree,excuse me?
1415,Bree,"oh, you think i won't?"
4000,Bree,i just want to protect what is rightfully mine. can you help me?
2021,Bree,mm-mm.
3799,Bree,"no, you were a dentist. now you're a caterer, and you're paid fairly based on your expertise and contribution."
559,Bree,let's just say that i put them in an imaginary box and don't plan on looking at them for a while.
1288,Bree,it's in my purse.
3593,Bree,you are so sweet.
3279,Bree,"oh, yes. your mother loved hot dogs. every day at lunchtime, she'd say to me, ""mommy, i want hot dog."""
3029,Bree,susan 
3043,Bree,you are?
3654,Bree,"oh, don't worry about us. jackson is so great. you are making the right choice."
3333,Bree,i don't think we need to do that.
2015,Bree,is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
3416,Bree,"when you're done with that, the oven could use a really good scrubbing."
1769,Bree,"get away from her!danielle,i want you to pick up the phone and call the police."
408,Bree,and have you fulfilled those needs?
2749,Bree,what is wrong with that? i thought we liked conformity.
1068,Bree,"i think perhaps the machine picked up on something, something that i wasn't aware of."
2372,Bree,you're my husband's ex-wife. you disappeared so people would think he killed you.does my discomfort really need any further explanation?
2620,Bree,it seems to me that you should go to the doctor again.
3695,Bree,now that's how you make an entrance.
2407,Bree,"orson, your ex-wife is a homicidal rapist, and your mother is straight out of ""i, claudius."" why do you refuse to deal with them?"
3190,Bree,we are. that's why your name is on the dedication page.
3603,Bree,"no, no, no. this can't possibly be true. the man is a doctor. are you sure?"
4089,Bree,"filing a false insurance claim. he's the one who filed it, but he's gonna say that i told him to."
835,Bree,"i've had one better, in italy."
3704,Bree,i have a job. i'm a homemaker.
935,Bree,"yes, of course you did. thank you very much for calling."
3171,Bree,mm. and i know this before i've tasted it?
222,Bree,"oh no, i don't worry about john. both he and danielle are in the abstinence club."
3025,Bree,who could that be at this hour? susan. what on earth?
76,Bree,i'll make braised lamb shanks.
534,Bree,would that hurt you rex? if i slept with another man?
3725,Bree,"was it just me, or was that a little abrupt?"
3740,Bree,okay.
4004,Bree,how would i go about doing that?
630,Bree,really?
1441,Bree,"yeah,why?"
3302,Bree,these are advanced copies. i wanted you to be the first to have them.
1692,Bree,"fine!yes,um--so,um,who goes first?"
158,Bree,"oh,please! i would have hosted it myself, only the kids are going away to the mountains tomorrow and there's camping equipment everywhere."
2922,Bree,"oh, lord."
1678,Bree,"well,you're not my sponsor anymore,so i assume this is allowable.i mean,it's just a casual get-together."
1409,Bree,"no, no, not him.helen rowland's son, john."
2543,Bree,another one? it's time for an anonymous letter.
1716,Bree,"oh,by the way,while i was there, i saw your,uh,your housekeeper.xiao-mei?"
953,Bree,bye.
780,Bree,how you can sit there and be so casual is beyond me?
915,Bree,hi. what are you doing here?
2437,Bree,"i'd love that. what about your mother? after all the things she's done, she's just gonna get off scot-free?"
512,Bree,you shouldn't listen to a woman who's just had her heart broken. we tend to lie.
2383,Bree,what's a garden without a snake?
2776,Bree,don't.
1186,Bree,i will let you make all the arrangements. something out of town would be nice. good night.
2507,Bree,what about her?
3607,Bree,why would he--
43,Bree,"good, i'm gonna go make myself some, uh, warm milk. would you like something to drink?"
679,Bree,"well, um, i've been doing some thinking. rex and i have been members of the fairview country club for years, and, well, lately, it seems to have lost some of its exclusivity, and so i've decided not to renew our membership. i'd rather see the money go to someone i care about."
698,Bree,"now, not five hours from now."
1737,Bree,"yeah, apparently,he was seeing someone."
3386,Bree,go away. i don't feel well.
2769,Bree,addicts are experts at deception.
2943,Bree,"i meant sample, like a buffet. you take a little plate of everything, and then you sit down for the main course, which is across the street--at the presbyterian church."
2828,Bree,"well, i know katherine, and believe me, you're not the only person i've seen her reduce to tears."
1625,Bree,with what?you don't have any money.
1015,Bree,this is rex's mother phyllis.
1829,Bree,"well,i just keep messing it up.i don't know what's wrong with me."
353,Bree,lynette--
3209,Bree,"well, you knew what the book was gonna be called."
384,Bree,"were you with a woman? did you tell her that you have a wife, or does that hinder your pick-up style?"
1003,Bree,phyllis? you're going to have to stop that.
2090,Bree,because i thought you'd want to know.
195,Bree,"zachery, it's alright!"
2803,Bree,"is this about the other morning? oh, for heaven sakes, you can't be serious."
3078,Bree,"edie, if word got out, my whole family would be--humiliated."
2814,Bree,okay. now i--i really am gonna cry.
315,Bree,are the lady fingers okay?
2118,Bree,"andrew, please don't interrupt me while i'm speaking.true, i never bought her eldest daughter a gift, but you know my policy: no husband, no baby gift. now what is it, dear?"
75,Bree,"well, good, because i have some new flatbread that i've just been dying to show off."
2081,Bree,yes. i left you two messages. didn't you check your voice mail? he woke up from his coma.
869,Bree,what on earth?
1421,Bree,my son is trying to blackmail me.and i want you to stop the little sobdo you think you could do that?
3946,Bree,"this was a wonderful idea, karen."
3139,Bree,"uh, why don't i let you two work this out?"
2454,Bree,did you find him?
1264,Bree,"oh, come on. you don't think you're gonna love your own baby?"
3120,Bree,aah!
2973,Bree,"oh, no, thank you. we have so much ground to cover. now let's move on to the flowers. uh, last year, we went with a cascade of pink and white roses. there it is."
716,Bree,there's this place called camp hennessy.
3067,Bree,it's not really a good time.
1129,Bree,"you know, mostly i'm annoyed that the whole thing happened in the first place. i mean how in the world can anyone accuse me of murder?"
1234,Bree,"well, obviously there's a downside to having good manners."
882,Bree,"well, i guess it wouldn't hurt to sit her down and share our concerns."
3546,Bree,"either tell mike how you feel or move on, because that's what he's trying to do, and it's not fair to stop him. you need to make a decision, susan. and i need to get back to my nap."
3136,Bree,"so after the ceremony, we'll open up the buffet--"
1382,Bree,"this pain that you're feeling is completely natural, but it's not gonna go away until you deal with it. andrew, i want us to heal. i want us to be a family again."
2909,Bree,"orson, i don't want to be late."
1475,Bree,"oh, while i'm here i might as well grab some of your laundry."
3568,Bree,"are you married, dr. cominis?"
3056,Bree,"oh, hello, dylan. you look lovely."
1476,Bree,"honey, stop complaining.one day you'll wish that someone were offering to do your laundry."
3678,Bree,i mean i bought you a house. you'd think you'd show me a little respect.
997,Bree,"that darn insurance company is dragging its heels on paying rex's policy, and i don't understand why."
3578,Bree,of course i have.
479,Bree,"it'll, um, it'll be a lot easier once he gets well enough to move out."
91,Bree,"yes, it's just gonna be a casual night with the gang. we're going to eat, and tell fun stories about your mum. zach, are-are you okay?"
788,Bree,"andrew, please just go and talk to reverend sykes."
989,Bree,i'm saying that even italians take a break now and again.
1285,Bree,"well, fortunately, people only read the announcements when there's nothing in the front page, and the headline today was about some catastrophic flood in sri lanka."
3719,Bree,here's my cookbook.
2847,Bree,"well, katherine, for what it's worth--i would've spit in her face, too."
3861,Bree,close enough.
2031,Bree,a reporter just did a story on homeless teens and my son was one of them.
1440,Bree,"yeah,they're secretive and watchful.and there was a dead body found in front of their house."
328,Bree,because i need to know that you're not a monster!
826,Bree,"rex, have you lost your mind?"
103,Bree,"rex. in college, when we first started dating, people were so jealous of us. we were the golden couple. everybody knew we were gonna have this wonderful life. why is this happening?"
2049,Bree,"excuse me, young man. have you seen this boy?andrew! oh, my god, thank god!"
1504,Bree,"well, perhaps i got more excited than i should have,but i recently found out that betty applewhite is quite the poker player,and so, uh, i have invited her to join our weekly game."
3970,Bree,"well, that's odd."
3655,Bree,"of course this will require an updated irrigation system, which i'm happy to take care of."
628,Bree,"well, i'll tell you. my daughter is planning on giving you her virginity and i would consider it a personal favor if you wouldn't take it."
1225,Bree,hi.
1658,Bree,"yes,and his lawyer is taking depositions now to see if i am a fit parent.and considering that mishap that i had with your kids,i,uh,i imagine he'll be anxious to talk to you."
517,Bree,"oh, george."
3794,Bree,"okay, fine. if i had to pick a favorite, i guess it would be munchy. she was a bit rambunctious. father sent her to a farm so she'd have room to run. i cried for weeks and weeks."
620,Bree,john rowland? i thought you broke up with him.
1883,Bree,"you know, i really don't have time for this nonsense.are you going to give me some serious drugs or not?"
1011,Bree,"i do. i'm just, i'm just not ready yet. but it was very sweet of you to think of me."
551,Bree,maybe he's just trying to be supportive.
4127,Bree,proceed.
988,Bree,"for god sakes, phyllis, don't you ever worry about dehydration?"
3687,Bree,"alex-- i'm gonna tell you something i haven't told anybody-- not orson, not andrew, just you. i know that i've changed since my business took off, but i didn't want to admit it. i've watched myself become selfish, impatient, rude. i was never the type to suffer fools gladly, but now i seem to find fools everywhere. and i don't want to be that way. i need someone who isn't afraid to speak out, to call me out when i cross those lines, and i would love it if you would be that person."
0,Bree,"there we go. feel better? lynette, you were saying?"
1138,Bree,"well, i know, but rex died in his care. of course he'd like to blame someone else."
300,Bree,"well, everybody should, uh, go wash up. we're having pancakes for breakfast."
145,Bree,"god only knows what she's had to deal with in her life-abject poverty,drugs, domestic violence. maybe even molestation."
1433,Bree,"oh,it was no trouble at all."
4031,Bree,was that necessary?
958,Bree,"reverend, if you don't call her on that incredibly insensitive comment, i'm gonna lose it."
3937,Bree,i don't know. can you ever be ready to tell a boy that his mother is dead?
3104,Bree,"they'll love that. this is gonna be the best seniors' brunch ever. i'm so glad you're back. between you and me, reverend sykes tended to pander to the congregation's progressive element. i prefer your more muscular brand of christianity."
749,Bree,how can you say that it doesn't matter? of course it matters.
2267,Bree,"okay, look, i know you're upset, but don't blame orson. it's not his fault."
2336,Bree,"well, when you're wrong, you're wrong."
1911,Bree,"oh! does anybody ever call you ""alfie""?"
2408,Bree,"please don't touch me.all this time,you've said you wanted the truth.that's before i knew what it was."
3318,Bree,what kind of meeting is it?
2968,Bree,"i acknowledge that katherine and i have had our differences, but we have all been through a lot recently."
3909,Bree,nice try.
3888,Bree,"thank you, dear."
1078,Bree,"andrew, that wasn't a hint."
2205,Bree,"andrew, it's etiquette. nobody wants to read the truth at christmas."
2754,Bree,what a lovely ceremony. i'm deborah's friend bree. i have what may strike you as a very odd request.
1271,Bree,"you know, honey, people change."
3032,Bree,"you adored it, as i recall. that's why i'm giving you the choice. and what about that hummel from your aunt? it's ugly as sin, but she insists that it's valuable."
3536,Bree,not exactly true. the doctor said there's a very simple procedure--
108,Bree,"well, why can't you?"
3670,Bree,"uh, yeah. in the test kitchen."
4039,Bree,"orson, we've been robbed!"
84,Bree,"private sessions? i don't understand, why do we need private sessions?"
3914,Bree,that would be lovely. oh. you were being sarcastic.
1718,Bree,"yeah,apparently you gave her a gift certificate."
702,Bree,i will not. we're gonna talk about this now.
1786,Bree,"listen,i don't expect you to lie about the alcoholism.i mean,they know that's how we met.it's just--you know,the other thing."
1818,Bree,surprise!
2541,Bree,"well, i stopped by katherine's last night just to get a recipe, and you'll never believe what i overheard."
1549,Bree,there. is that better?
3030,Bree,i think it's admirable that you wanna forgive orson--because i can't.
1258,Bree,"gaby, if i make it any tighter, you won't be able to sit down."
1668,Bree,"it's not a good time for change in my life,peter.terrible things are happening.i'm headed to court.i need your support now more than ever."
590,Bree,"um, how about boise?"
2395,Bree,baby?!
2281,Bree,"well, i will take that under advisement."
2957,Bree,i suppose. i just wanted to let you know that. and also to-- apologize.
2790,Bree,"apparently, ""not to pry"" wasn't necessary."
2560,Bree,what is it?
1236,Bree,"well, i know it sounds rash, but, well, there's something comfortable about george. we share the same tastes and interests. oh, and best of all, he loves the opera."
1353,Bree,and then we'll call an ambulance and they'll pump your stomach.
3314,Bree,"oh, my god! that is so amazing! the, uh, dry cleaner just, um--found my sweater."
3250,Bree,"at this point, i would just run off screaming into the night."
2106,Bree,"actually, gus, um, i'm here to see one of your guests-- a gentleman named faladi."
3154,Bree,"was i lucky, or were you following me?"
1964,Bree,you don't have to wash those.i already did them.
99,Bree,"hotel by the interstate has better rates, and, uh, it's closer to your work."
626,Bree,oh.
894,Bree,wait a minute. what in the world are you talking about?
1684,Bree,what are you doing here?
3252,Bree,it's after midnight. haven't you eaten?
3874,Bree,"i had hoped that this compulsion to steal was something we could solve privately, but orson seems unableor unwilling-- to control himself."
56,Bree,"oh, who cares what he thinks? i took psychology in college, we learned all about freud. a miserable human being."
1712,Bree,"you know,justin,if you would be willing to help,i'm pretty sure that i could find a way to keep andrew from moving.what do you say?"
2712,Bree,"okay, everybody, in the house now."
2431,Bree,gloria? what are you doing here?
2390,Bree,what the hell is this?!
2552,Bree,but you don't mind orson being your dentist.
3419,Bree,yes. he said you were roommates back in college.
4098,Bree,what?
2318,Bree,so you deliberately framed orson?
834,Bree,rex just hates these cooks tours. he likes to stay at home with the same old spaghetti and mug of root beer.
1080,Bree,andrew!
2745,Bree,that you even felt such a thing was necessary.
1903,Bree,"i am trying to ensure that they turn into responsible adults.trust me, rex, in the end, we will be rewarded."
2671,Bree,"well, we were gonna surprise you with one for your birthday, but since you're keeping the baby, you'll want a more practical gift."
1034,Bree,"no, you may not record this."
1351,Bree,george. george!
2894,Bree,"exactly, and now, um, his tastes have gone to the more mature, cultured types, like, uh, walter here."
3299,Bree,"no, uh, mr. van de kamp is deceased."
295,Bree,andrew--
1544,Bree,"well,okay.tony?how many more arias is he gonna sing?"
2986,Bree,no! that's--that's my job. i always do it.
15,Bree,are you doing drugs?
2930,Bree,"well, then maybe you should explore other options. i mean, if you really enjoy talking ck to the pulpit, why don't you try that gospel church by the airport?"
2012,Bree,i just need a moment.
3362,Bree,"lynette, i am really not able to deal with that right now."
1443,Bree,"are you sure that you can't check on the applewhites?i mean,i just know that there's something there.and,you know,i have a sixth sense about people."
319,Bree,i see.
1500,Bree,"but, betty, the police are looking for him.he escaped from that facility they sent him to."
3065,Bree,"oh, yes, the neighborhood's safe. i wish i could say the same for your real estate agent."
2991,Bree,"katherine, darling, are you okay?"
3892,Bree,it was my idea. my work has been compromising my marriage. i didn't realize the toll it's been taking on orson.
2290,Bree,"oh, thank god!"
2001,Bree,"well, i don't pay attention to gossip."
3847,Bree,"i don't need to walk in your shoes, orson. what you did was embarrassing and childish, and it's never gonna happen again. understood?"
1908,Bree,"well, i'm only supposed to be restrained until 7.you see, i have a problem with sleepwalking.they just tie me up so that i don't wander off and hurt myself."
1693,Bree,"andrew,i forgive you."
967,Bree,"it's true rex and i did not have the perfect marriage, but for eighteen years i tried my very best, and for that i am entitled to your respect."
4054,Bree,charming.
277,Bree,"is, is that what you would prefer, danielle? to live with your father."
175,Bree,paul?
886,Bree,so could i.
649,Bree,i need a favor.
1617,Bree,"did he just call her ""baby""?"
1856,Bree,i'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation.i'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
1519,Bree,"what did this caleb do,exactly?and why on earth are they hiding him?"
1465,Bree,"thanks,betty,and,um--i'd appreciate it if you could keep this little incident to yourself."
3233,Bree,"and waste valuable airtime? the show was about my cookbook, not about my tortured marital history."
1332,Bree,"i am not kidding. if you do not knock it off, i'm going to call the police!"
488,Bree,"oh, and we got so lucky with the weather, it's just absolutely -"
204,Bree,hello?
3943,Bree,"lord, lynette. you nearly gave me a heart attack."
2132,Bree,powerful?
1007,Bree,george. what are you doing here?
2241,Bree,of course.
1474,Bree,really? because i'm holding your backpack with all your schoolbooks.
1146,Bree,thank you.
1811,Bree,"you know what? maybe andrew leaving will be good for us.you are all i have left,and i am gonna be the best mother that i can be."
3196,Bree,the secret to spinning sugar is this special whisk that makes lovely gossamer threads.
810,Bree,"really? well, okay. you know what i'm going to miss most about him? george always has a way of making me feel good about myself."
1462,Bree,"oh,oh,i'm fine.i just,um,had a flat tire."
1857,Bree,"hello. i'm bree van de kamp, your new neighbor.is this your frog?"
3989,Bree,split the pot.
969,Bree,i do want you to come to the funeral.
2057,Bree,"yeah, it's nice to know that i can raise some things correctly."
722,Bree,"fine, i won't send them but i think it's a stupid rule."
3036,Bree,turn yourself in to the police.
202,Bree,"oh,good, because last night you put me in such a holiday mood, so i'm going to make roast turkey and canned yams and egg nog. have you ever had real old-fashioned egg nog?"
3602,Bree,what?
1252,Bree,"it's not just that, george. dr. goldfine has other concerns about us being together, and i'm starting to think he's right."
2927,Bree,"well, last sunday, when you kept raising your hand--we don't really do that. the church isn't a place for questions. it's a place for answers."
2685,Bree,how many times have i told you to stay away from the windows?
4058,Bree,that is not a doormat. that is a handwoven kurdish kazak rug.
310,Bree,we could have been better parents.
3941,Bree,"still, she was your mother."
1602,Bree,i'm sorry.i didn't quite catch that.
1703,Bree,"oh,but not you.with you,i had to work for every kind word i ever got."
2583,Bree,"orson, honey, where have you been?"
3700,Bree,i'm sorry if the frittata is a bit dry.
2255,Bree,is anything broken?
2704,Bree,"oh, it's just a quick visit. she's driving back tomorrow."
870,Bree,i was teasing you.
3412,Bree,"no, it doesn't. and besides, i gave you the day off. now go home."
838,Bree,"i can't go on a trip with you, george."
3449,Bree,you can't just move because of one bad date.
2156,Bree,"hello, tish."
4045,Bree,"oh, that's right."
677,Bree,"well, then, good luck on your remodel."
3453,Bree,no.
1750,Bree,"it's just awful, isn't it?i mean, you never know what people are doing behind your back.would you like some milk with your cookies?"
2166,Bree,that would be lovely. thanks.
813,Bree,"george, as it turns out i won't be able to go with you to the bonsai expo."
2471,Bree,yet another illustration of the fundamental selfishness of suicide.
2492,Bree,ohh.
763,Bree,"we made our decision, let's just stick to it."
3919,Bree,"if she's visiting my husband, i think i have a right to know"
4005,Bree,"i need your help, karl. i really do, but i am not comfortable manipulating a 6-year-old."
1432,Bree,"oh,hi."
629,Bree,she said that you broke up with her because she refused to have sex.
2009,Bree,"if the three of you don't drop this right now, i will never forgive you."
1494,Bree,"no, i'm not.and i forbid you to go over there."
3001,Bree,the photographer's asking if he can get shots of the two of us.
1076,Bree,"ah, wel,l it's getting late, so-"
3373,Bree,who?
1585,Bree,"andrew,did i hear the bell?oh,hello."
2136,Bree,hello.
2563,Bree,"danielle, what if your reckless behavior had hurt the baby?"
1098,Bree,"george, you have to have this. it's absolutely scrumptious."" ""ummm, ummm!"
2476,Bree,"oh,well,i'm--i'm sorry about your vegetables,but that pine shields my view of the purcells' backyard,and if you had ever seen mr.purcell sunbathe,well,you'd know exactly what that tree means to me."
672,Bree,"well, it's just that you've been acting kind of odd lately."
1100,Bree,well. what did he say?
38,Bree,good. i have a question for you.
336,Bree,"you've got four kids. that's a lot of stress. honey, you need some help."
904,Bree,it doesn't matter.
2874,Bree,"you're funny. now i need you to be honest about this recipe. it's a dry run for a small dinner party i'm having tomorrow night. again, if you don't mind."
4067,Bree,so you wait for an opportunity that you can use to your advantage while at the same time appearing supportive.
3677,Bree,"you know what else would be nice, alex? showing gratitude when people have been generous with you."
885,Bree,don't say that.
1644,Bree,i was just giving you a little kiss.
825,Bree,"come on, rex, you owe george some sort of a gesture."
2152,Bree,"well, i can appreciate how difficult that must have been for you. apology accepted."
2998,Bree,"ever since i started working with that obnoxious backstabber, she's done nothing but try to take the spotlight off of me and put it onto her."
3785,Bree,"honey, please don't do this."
2075,Bree,"orson, you're scaring me. did he do something awful?"
1265,Bree,"well, i'm just smiling because i think a few months from now you are gonna come to me and tell me how madly in love you are with your new little baby, and i'm gonna have to resist the urge to say 'i told you so.'"
2041,Bree,i left him on the roadside with some money and his clothes.i didn't tell you because i was afraid of what you would think of me.
3772,Bree,"oh, lynette, don't be silly. it's just the bumper. you don't need to do that."
3410,Bree,"i don't know--read, relax, give yourself a pedicure."
1792,Bree,"isn't this wonderful?good food,pleasant conversation--this really is a very special night."
242,Bree,"""i love everything about it. the sensations, the smells. i especially love the feel of a man. all that muscle and sinew pressed against my body. and then, when you add friction. mmm -- the tactile sensation of running my tongue over a man's nipple ever so gently. and then there's the act itself - two bodies becoming one in that final eruption of pleasure. to be honest, the only thing i don't like about sex is the scrotum. i mean, obviously it has its practical applications, but i'm just not a fan."" "
42,Bree,you promised.
282,Bree,don't you two see what he is doing? he's trying to get you on his side. he's trying to buy your love.
1574,Bree,"well,good. i mean,i just--i really wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression.well,i'm--i'm going to the mall.they're having a white sale today.i think i'm gonna get a new bath mat.oh,does anyone need one?"
250,Bree,"sorry. i just - ah, come on, are you going to make a big deal about this?"
1215,Bree,"well, i'll just have to get over it, won't i?"
209,Bree,what is it?
1833,Bree,"sweetheart,this is your special day.all of your candless should be lit.it'll just take me two seconds."
1686,Bree,what?! why?
109,Bree,"dr. goldfine, please?"
3131,Bree,hi! we were just talking about you.
1996,Bree,"oh, that reminds me. and don't worry susan, i will think of a job for you."
1945,Bree,"yes, i will marry you, orson."
1979,Bree,"oh you know, that warm sensation, that tingling feeling of relief when it's over.no, no, this was much--"
2,Bree,"it was no trouble at all. now the basket with the red ribbon is just for you and zachary. it's got rolls, muffins, breakfast type things."
2717,Bree,i am going back to get adam.
959,Bree,the happiest time in rex's life was not his childhood. he loved being a husband and he loved being a father.
2891,Bree,"well, say no more. one slice coming right up."
1970,Bree,but orson!
1212,Bree,can't you just be patient? can't you wait just a little bit longer?
1087,Bree,yes. a bad one. i hope you haven't made plans for tomorrow night.
3481,Bree,"no! i-i refuse to pay blackmail to some hooligan who's stolen from us twice! andrew--all my life, i have done my best to teach you to respect god and the law and never to harm another living thing. i want you to forget every one of those lessons if it'll help you get that tape back."
3433,Bree,is he gay? ugh! i knew he had too much product in his hair.
1973,Bree,i have to go.
2387,Bree,are those shoes suede?
2329,Bree,good. i'll see you at eight o'clock.
2575,Bree,"oh, susan, i am so sorry, and, of course, i will pay for the slashed tire and the stolen cell phone."
4014,Bree,"i used to think of myself as a good person. if i had a choice, i would always choose the high road. lately i've begun to realize that, um--i'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done."
2405,Bree,"okay, this is no joke. she raped you, and your mother helped. look, after we get dressed, we're going to the police."
2096,Bree,"danielle! danielle, he is your history teacher, and he is 35 years old!"
814,Bree,i think it would be a mistake for us to spend too much time together.
509,Bree,"hey. hi, george. i'm so sorry you lost your toe. the doctor said it's your middle one so your balance shouldn't be affected. i mean, this really won't change your life one little bit. please say something."
1363,Bree,''where did you find them?''
46,Bree,"oh, have i?"
3235,Bree,should i be proud? do you want me to go on the radio and boast that my husband served time for running someone over?
2514,Bree,what happened to the pie that i brought?
3152,Bree,"yes, and the ""venus de milo"" is missing two arms. what's your point?"
35,Bree,"well, we could do it gently. we could tell him about it over coffee and pastry."
1654,Bree,hello.
1688,Bree,she's so adorable and i just love the name lily
2613,Bree,"orson, i said be careful! i just think it's tacky to have a baby shower when it's not your first baby."
1761,Bree,"yes,i'm aware of that."
1169,Bree,what is it?
489,Bree,"you know, your lunch hour is almost up. we should probably be getting you back to the pharmacy."
606,Bree,"well, you know what? if he is innocent, this should be a simple matter to clear up."
1762,Bree,"peter?peter, it's bree.are you in there?"
1366,Bree,"''no,wait!is that supposed to be me?''"
331,Bree,"what i'm worried about, andrew, is that you don't seem to have a soul. give me one good reason why i shouldn't call the police!"
1387,Bree,"he didn't die on his terms, andrew. he paid for what he did to your father."
3062,Bree,hi!
2473,Bree,what a beautiful family.i feel so lucky to have you for a neighbor.
4001,Bree,lovely. i'll make out a check.
3163,Bree,first we have to do something to stop that bleeding.
3466,Bree,"yeah, and the best part is we get to see each other all the time."
3258,Bree,i do not require lectures on tact.
2659,Bree,buy a dictionary.
1416,Bree,i didn't kill george.
2864,Bree,"hello, boys. bob, lee, i baked you some muffins to thank you for introducing me to walter here. and, walter, i decided you're absolutely right. dark shingles are the way to go. why are you all staring at me?"
3454,Bree,"you are a vibrant, attractive woman, you--"
1256,Bree,do you really want to know my secret?
3890,Bree,"oh, shoot. i left them upstairs."
1695,Bree,"andrew,i find your concern ironic,given how tanked you were when you ran over our neighbor's mother with your car."
285,Bree,did you offer to help danielle get into modeling school?
193,Bree,"zach,calm down."
2425,Bree,susan.
3055,Bree,"i hope so. truth is, i miss him. and i'll probably let him come home eventually. i just need to know he understands the gravity of what he did."
2240,Bree,"orson, if there's something i should know."
2129,Bree,andrew! not in front of the therapist.
3609,Bree,so--he's the one?
2851,Bree,we're giving you shelter. you could at least be gracious.
1842,Bree,barbie!
212,Bree,this is not up for discussion.
2698,Bree,really? i thought you were one of those liberal gun haters.
2117,Bree,"i'm telling you, it was a deliberate snub. i waved to her, and she looked right through me. true, i never bought her eldest daughter a gift--"
1205,Bree,"well, you're the pharmacist. if you think it's okay--"
4029,Bree,"oh, god, no. that's orson's dental innovator of the year award. i've always hated that thing. oh, here."
3887,Bree,"oh, andrew. i didn't hear you come in."
906,Bree,"i don't know, rex. maybe you were bragging or maybe you just subconsciously wanted to hurt me. well, congratulations, you did it. i am officially destroyed."
2551,Bree,i thought you were using dr. mayfair.
2831,Bree,really?
3182,Bree,"katherine! fantastic news. ""what's cookin' fairview?"" is sending out a camera crew tomorrow to do a piece on me and the book."
2163,Bree,"hello.i'd like to make a reservation for this evening under the names hodge and bigsby, and, um, we'll be needing a table in the center of the room."
427,Bree,your adultery? no. i decided to keep that little gem all to myself.
2743,Bree,what do you mean you can't help me?
1311,Bree,"oh, um, the, the stone is loose. so i'm gonna take it to the jewelers. but don't worry, it's safe."
1467,Bree,"yes,but the difference is most of those people were actually drunk when they were arrested.i was not."
1254,Bree,i'll talk to dr. goldfine about it tomorrow.
1209,Bree,guilty?
815,Bree,it doesn't matter.
54,Bree,dr. goldfine. there is something you can do for me.
3370,Bree,thanks.
2050,Bree,looking for you. how did you get that bruise?
3756,Bree,we'll chat later. roll out some dough and show me where the basil is. we'll be serving three cheese pizza tonight.
3445,Bree,"well, if he tries, just promise you'll call."
1187,Bree,"i don't know. i thought maybe we could go antiquing."" ""i hear you have some lovely museums nearby. do you have any brochures?"
3473,Bree,what?
1687,Bree,"dad,you don't understand.this has gotten really ugly."
982,Bree,"i'm sorry. this is, uh, rex's mother, phyllis."
1657,Bree,"thanks,but i'm not really out of the woods yet.i still have this whole court case hanging over my head."
3431,Bree,yes.
4009,Bree,invite evan mayer to your sleepover.
249,Bree,"okay, baby, where were we?"
1065,Bree,they asked me if i loved you.
2817,Bree,you're leaving fairview?
567,Bree,and the dinner parties. don't forget the dinner parties.
2582,Bree,gaby!
807,Bree,they did?
3792,Bree,"well, i didn't really have a favorite. i loved them all equally."
4018,Bree,you want me to rob my own house?
920,Bree,thank you.
804,Bree,please don't be this way. he's the only friend i have who is interested in cultural things.
2458,Bree,"hello? hodge residence. oh, hi, danielle. listen, i am sending julie mayer an e-mail from you. now would you say that your school was off the hook?"
2206,Bree,"honey, would you put on another cd? something with sleigh bells."
3291,Bree,"i gave him a hot dog, all right? he liked it so much, he asked for another."
2251,Bree,you cannot let your mother move into this neighborhood. it's filled with junkies and who*es.
1843,Bree,what the hell is wrong with you?!now it's ruined!everything is ruined!
4084,Bree,you would actually send your wife to prison?
2692,Bree,"well, you say that now, but once you've held your child and felt that rush of love, well--it can change you."
1154,Bree,"yes, because he left a note. and it said, and i quote, ""bree, i understand and i forgive you."" i spent eighteen years of my life with this man. how could he not know me?"
1936,Bree,orson.
3801,Bree,you're paid based on your contribution.
1648,Bree,so-- how long has it been since you--
1839,Bree,you look like a girl who enjoys her frosting.
2566,Bree,"clearly, it would be time well spent."
948,Bree,"i don't think so, but thank you, though."
3438,Bree,are you telling me that i set katherine up with a convicted graverobber?!
2868,Bree,this is a nightmare. what is going on?
3982,Bree,so i think i have to divorce him.
797,Bree,"well, why don't we just go by ourselves then?"
2224,Bree,and i can't believe you told me that she was senile! you lied to me.
3860,Bree,"yes, that would be lovely."
1808,Bree,"absolutely not.just give me an hour or two to straighten up andrew's room,and then you can bring your-- selves over."
914,Bree,there. now we can go.
2182,Bree,"oh, how did she fall?"
2110,Bree,"oh, and, gus, the carpet is beautiful."
3735,Bree,okay.
2139,Bree,good.then we're all set.here are some of her clothes.i'll bring her cds and her stuffed animals over tomorrow.
1117,Bree,i love it. thank you.
293,Bree,"oh my god, thank god you're here. will you go take care of gabrielle? i have to go home for a minute."
3753,Bree,so that's like the dust they sweep off the floor of a place that makes real cheese.
337,Bree,i used to get so upset when andrew and danielle were little. i used their nap times to cry.
3013,Bree,"prove me wrong, sweetie. prove me wrong."
3276,Bree,"oh, just some old pictures. can you guess who that little girl is?"
1554,Bree,boys?boys?
3814,Bree,how's tom holding up?
3552,Bree,when you were downstairs.
3011,Bree,no. never.
2944,Bree,"no, no problem. just talking to my friend."
2415,Bree,"make no mistake,our friendship is over."
3340,Bree,"um, i think ""understated"" was what they were going for."
308,Bree,i remember telling them when they were babies that they weren't allowed to get any bigger because they were so adorable. and we were so happy.
2327,Bree,"i just feel really awful about our fight, and i-i think it's time for an apology."
770,Bree,it's for his own good. you'll see.
2039,Bree,"ah, she's right.this is all my fault."
2532,Bree,that recipe is not from a book. that recipe was handed down to me from my mother.
465,Bree,"because i don't commit adultery like your father."" ""that's right. your father had an affair. i found out about it, and i'm just trying to move on with my life."
3459,Bree,"well, then i suggest you return your purchase. do you have a receipt?"
1946,Bree,"hi, hi, hi, hi.i'm so sorry i'm late."
2663,Bree,let him talk.
2829,Bree,"yes. that was unfortunate. if you need any antibacterial soap, i-"
2669,Bree,"danielle, you should introduce yourself. these people are your new friends."
92,Bree,"oh hi, paul, i was just?"
1217,Bree,"honey, you need to put that in a frame or something."
1172,Bree,"i'm sorry, george, but you have to go."
1429,Bree,i don't think i can do that.
2381,Bree,i don't care!i am not sleeping in a bed that had your dead mistress' teeth in it!let's just take them to the police.
3289,Bree,no! of course not.
246,Bree,"thanks. i was hoping you'd notice."" ""well, it certainly isn't the ritz, but it has all the essentials."
2904,Bree,i'll be right back.
2571,Bree,"oh, hi, gaby. katherine and i were just talking about the old days. so when you were living with your aunt, was dylan's father with you?"
3399,Bree,fine. you're fired.
144,Bree,that's someone's little girl. and that someone probably had a lot of dreams for her.dreams that did not include a thong and a pole.
811,Bree,"honey, do your hands still tremble when they touch me?"
3692,Bree,"what does that mean, ""an entrance""?"
2893,Bree,oh. you're going to eat that--here?
733,Bree,"porter, what did i tell you?"
724,Bree,"because the minute i get there, andrew will start attacking me for abandoning him and i don't want to hear it."
514,Bree,and-?
3504,Bree,good. i can check that off my list.
3764,Bree,caught a couple of breaks? i've worked my ass off to get where i am.
1456,Bree,i beg your pardon?
938,Bree,"lynette, hi, it's bree. i do hope i's not calling too early. hmm? oh, of course you can borrow that scarf. i'll press it for you. um, i have, uh, some news. rex died."
3575,Bree,you're living with the man? since when?
579,Bree,what the hell did your mother do to you?
166,Bree,almost. thanks again for driving them to the bus.
1373,Bree,he hasn't got a clue.
2289,Bree,what in the world?
1980,Bree,yes.
4040,Bree,"they're robbers, dear. not personal shoppers."
1454,Bree,i'd rather you didn't.
3980,Bree,orson's lying to me again. so i think i have to divorce him.
2910,Bree,"yeah, but i'm sure edna fletcher has been there since 9:00, kissing up to reverend sykes."
2596,Bree,"no, you're pregnant, too. i'm not gonna tell you anything that's gonna worry you."
1790,Bree,"yes,i just--i'm worried you might be a little cold."
2854,Bree,"she said that she and adam were lovers and she could prove it because he had a tattoo, and--"
2889,Bree,bless you.
1384,Bree,"so, are you saying if he were executed, that it would be easier for you to get past this?"
1006,Bree,"so, uh, are we ready to order, or do you need a little more time?"
2598,Bree,"this is what we get for having kids at our age--anxiety, terror."
140,Bree,"so andrew, shall we?"
3267,Bree,excuse me?
2369,Bree,"you went over there to read her the riot act. instead, it looked like you were reading her a bedtime story."
2800,Bree,"hey, andrew. what are you doing?"
1947,Bree,"well, it's a very elegant club.you know orson's been a member here for years. it will be even nicer when they finish the construction."
3049,Bree,"well, um, just so you know, in the future, i'm not comfortable with that. this can't happen again."
929,Bree,thanks.
3761,Bree,"hey, you made me partner. i can change 15%, and i chose the parmesan. and i don't know if you've heard, but people are raving about my pizza."
1046,Bree,i'll waive all that. my only stipulation is that i want my children to be able to see me answer the questions.
3686,Bree,"this won't take long. i don't want to fight anymore. please, just take the house."
2708,Bree,"do not test me, young lady, or i will drag you out of here myself."
403,Bree,yes. why?
884,Bree,"i don't know why, but i have this overwhelming feeling that you're gonna be just fine. i really do."
3726,Bree,"oh, dear. is something wrong?"
3922,Bree,it isn't that kind of visit.
2705,Bree,"let's go get some cake, dear."
424,Bree,you wouldn't be saying that if you knew what -
3226,Bree,"well, i think a lot of people miss the way life used to be--back when women had more time to cook. it's always been important to me to have the family gather around the table every night for hot, lovingly prepared meals."
946,Bree,"phyllis, that's an orange tie."
3856,Bree,"well, maybe you'd feel more comfortable talking to a professional."
3877,Bree,"well, maybe you'll feel comfortable talking to a professional."
589,Bree,"well, it's just that my aunt fern lives in philadelphia and i don't want to be thinking about her while i'm spanking you with a leather strap."
2990,Bree,you really should have more faith in people. excuse me.
4123,Bree,"george, i can't feel my legs."
1550,Bree,boys--can you just keep it down just a little bit?because i have a very--special type of grown-up headache.
1269,Bree,how was your little reunion?
3881,Bree,would you excuse us for moment? this just became a private conversation.
578,Bree,"rex, please, i want to understand."
2580,Bree,no talking.
2498,Bree,"you think danielle could raise this child?orson,you've seen her in action.she's--she's shallow,and she's--she's selfish!she would ruin this child's life!"
2449,Bree,this might not be as easy as we'd hoped.
3320,Bree,"yes, you will."
3391,Bree,he's gonna be so ashamed of me.
104,Bree,dr. goldfine.
2137,Bree,"oh, mr. faladi, i'm not here to threaten you. i've come to give you my blessing."
178,Bree,"oh.well,, i guess i can do it by myself."
1261,Bree,"well, maybe they'll just be happy for you."
736,Bree,really?!
3456,Bree,you don't feel you've been underpaid?
253,Bree,"you humiliated me, rex. for no good reason."
270,Bree,"if andrew is angry about you moving out of the house, then perhaps he should shove your head into a locker!"
2999,Bree,"well, uh, this has been an evening full of, um--surprises. i never would've imagined that, um, i would be recognized by this wonderful organization --"
1106,Bree,"because. ever since i found out what andrew said, i've been doing some soul searching and i realize that everything that's happened is completely my fault."
1647,Bree,it was just a peck on the cheek.
1492,Bree,it's the applewhites. i don't want you to go near them.
2155,Bree,two lemonades for the victors.
3729,Bree,"well, it is pretty amazing!"
2480,Bree,perhaps i need to make my point a little more clearly.
1249,Bree,"well, he knows me, and certainly better than you do."
3818,Bree,"i tell you what. i will invite bruce over for dinner, you and tom can join us, and we'll turn it into a low pressure job interview."
2026,Bree,i hope to.
3688,Bree,"yes, i did."
844,Bree,edie! hi.
2880,Bree,walter recently split up with his life partner todd. they were gay.
160,Bree,"oh,you want me to recommend the twins?"
2292,Bree,"oh, me, too. there's nothing more relaxing than an afternoon of finger food and girl talk."
1897,Bree,"if anything happens to my daughter, so help me, god--"
3778,Bree,"oh, look! there's pretzels and cereal. i can see why they call it ""party mix."" it's like a party in a bowl."
1289,Bree,but if people see it--
3444,Bree,"no, i'm not."
389,Bree,"lynette, for the first time in years you finally have some free time, and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids."
2732,Bree,i thought you liked debbie and lou.
3498,Bree,"because she's your friend, and we're women. we don't do that to each other."
5,Bree,"oh yes, page one of the philanderer's handbook."
1094,Bree,"oh, you don't know the lengths i'd go to for even seating."
1822,Bree,"danielle, i just want you to have the best party you have ever had in your entire life."
3936,Bree,i think we're here.
3366,Bree,i'm not angry with you. i'm just sorry that you felt so--
3579,Bree,well--
453,Bree,ah. shall we?
97,Bree,rex cries after he ejaculates.
2144,Bree,danielle is applying to colleges. i do hope she can count on you for a glowing recommendation.
1412,Bree,andrew--i want you downstair-- now.
3553,Bree,since when have you become such an expert on chamomile?
2053,Bree,"andrew, you have every right to be angry with me, but if you knew how sorry i am--"
2175,Bree,"hey, is that the new neighbor?"
1985,Bree,"orson, what is she talking about?"
3660,Bree,don't encourage him! orson is a horrible negotiator. he's never met a sticker price he didn't like.
2245,Bree,i have done everything i can to make you happy and comfortable. what do you want from us?
3674,Bree,no. i wouldn't want to upset anyone.
2815,Bree,and some of us gave you very expensive wedding gifts.
2505,Bree,"so what did julie say, exactly?"
603,Bree,"well, if we take away his condoms, maybe--"
111,Bree,just some more about her nightmares and this girl she was afraid of.
2189,Bree,"well, i guess that makes us neighbors."
1110,Bree,"i just think if i spend a lot of time with him, it'll really help."
1294,Bree,"oh, well, that announcement was a bit premature."
1375,Bree,"well, the detective seems to think he was trying to get your father out of the way so he could marry me. honey, please use your coaster. that's gonna leave a ring."
1293,Bree,can i help you?
1247,Bree,and i'm not the only one who thinks that. other people have said the same thing.
2483,Bree,why must old ladies always do that?
1325,Bree,dr. goldfine has concerns about us being together and i'm starting to thinking he's right
610,Bree,is lisa your friend with the pierced navel?
599,Bree,andrew is still a child.
721,Bree,"well, i don't understand why."
1934,Bree,do it.
1931,Bree,if that's what it takes-- to get my daughter--
4128,Bree,that's very sweet.
498,Bree,"well, we sure have had some fun."
363,Bree,"excuse me,"
3731,Bree,"we just went to a second printing, and now they're talking a 3-book deal. so seriously, i am not gonna miss that money."
2488,Bree,"oh! no,no,i'm fine!i'm fine!"
2760,Bree,"well, he's out of town, and--our benjamin is 8 days old today. and if i don't do this, my grandma--tzeitel--will never forgive me, may she rest in peace."
4088,Bree,"you have no idea. now he's saying if i try to divorce him, he can go to the police and report me."
916,Bree,"um, he's stable, but, um, they have to put in a pacemaker, so they're gonna need to operate. how did you guys know?"
3002,Bree,"i misunderstood the situation, that's all. can we just leave it at that?"
2104,Bree,mr. faladi--
1071,Bree,i think the machine picked up on something that i wasn't aware of.
2887,Bree,and windows. and i am not pimping you out. i'm simply asking you to show some kindness to a lonely man who happens to be an excellent roofer.
482,Bree,"oh, packages! thank you."
3733,Bree,"then it's not a loan, it's a gift. don't you have a birthday coming up?"
2375,Bree,i'm so sorry. i br--broke a glass.
3673,Bree,"oh, i really couldn't say."
61,Bree,how much do we really wanna know about our neighbours?
2513,Bree,this is not my pie.
2766,Bree,of course not.
554,Bree,look at the guilt that she must've lived with.
3806,Bree,orson? why do you have a salt shaker from scavo's pizzeria?
3447,Bree,you will.
4110,Bree,"well, it's obvious you've never had to remove a cheese stain. hmph!"
2655,Bree,"well, good. you can decide to pack, because we are taking you back to the convent."
3837,Bree,"uh, bruce, why don't i wrap up a piece of that tart to go?"
3284,Bree,"well, what do you think?"
3434,Bree,"well, where did you meet?"
2121,Bree,of course. we'll get her all the help she needs.
124,Bree,"well, it's just temporary and-i thought it would upset you, so i was protecting you."
2806,Bree,"thank you. you know, i'd make it for every day if you'd move back home."
1525,Bree,i know. um--i came to see you.
1055,Bree,no.
2530,Bree,which is what? vanilla? nutmeg? cardamom?
752,Bree,"green. i'll go with green, everybody loves green."
1698,Bree,"eleanor,i thought you'd gone to bed."
706,Bree,come along.
1018,Bree,i was simply asking when you were planning to leave. there was no agenda behind the question.
1343,Bree,how can you not believe in evil? a man just threw you off a bridge for no reason.
1702,Bree,"my mother didn't think they were awful.when i made those same cookies for her,she loved them."
2349,Bree,please leave my house.
2064,Bree,"this is a family event, and we're all gonna enjoy it together. now, danielle, stop sniping and start thinking of an alibi for your brother."
1675,Bree,"peter. hi,it's bree."
4115,Bree,"so, how does this domination thing work?"
1736,Bree,"um, excuse me.i don't know what that means,but could you please stop saying it?"
2022,Bree,could you excuse me for a just a minute.
903,Bree,you're a liar.
1235,Bree,"that's why i wanted to talk to you. i mean, part of me just keeps thinking maybe i should just do it."
945,Bree,"here's your tea, phyllis."
3223,Bree,"oh, you know michelle?"
2935,Bree,"oh, is that happening now? i'd forgotten all about it."
1160,Bree,"i thought the duck turned out well. although the sauce was a little bit thick, but judging by how many helpings you had, i think i got away with it. what are you thinking about?"
879,Bree,"already? wow, good for her."
2936,Bree,delightful? i thought she annoyed you.
440,Bree,i'm keeping my eyes on the horizon. please tell me if i'm about to step on a body part.
843,Bree,"oh, it'll just take a second. i need to um, to get a recipe."
3411,Bree,what are you doing?
279,Bree,"rex, what's this about?"
461,Bree,yes.
3144,Bree,"okay, so you have another one of those in the truck? thank you."
2813,Bree,you forgive me?
1572,Bree,oh. good for you.did lynette mention the little tiff we had?
3610,Bree,"you're going to marry him. i thought he wasn't being honest with you. i wanted to protect you, so i"
1435,Bree,is it serious?
535,Bree,here you go.
3313,Bree,"what is it, andrew?"
2861,Bree,"you know, maybe a moment of silence wouldn't be such a bad idea."
1428,Bree,do we even know who he is?
341,Bree,it's just not right.
22,Bree,"okay, well, i got you the honey mustard dressing; the ranch looked just a little bit suspect."
2690,Bree,"well, you certainly don't seem happy here, and i thought maybe you were missing the nuns and the other girls."
2316,Bree,so you're alma. where have you been all this time?
2370,Bree,this isn't a social call. we need to talk.
893,Bree,i'm sorry?
1901,Bree,"oh, i will tie her down if necessary.i'm also thinking of checking her body for piercings while i'm at it."
570,Bree,"yes. and i suppose we'll make love tomorrow night, too."
3798,Bree,"yes, orson, we're all aware of how you got the job."
3297,Bree,"i was on my knees. i was sobbing. she said ""no"" and then ripped him out of my arms. you have no right to say that to me."
1184,Bree,"hi, it's bree."
1661,Bree,what do you mean?
1335,Bree,so stalking me is plan b?
495,Bree,"oh, absolutely. george, this is just so much better than an orchid."
854,Bree,what's the matter? you've been mopy all day.
793,Bree,"thank you for a wonderful service, reverend."
2180,Bree,"orson? if you have a moment, there's something i'd like your thoughts on."
976,Bree,--we don't really care what happens behind closed doors.
3787,Bree,what's that?
911,Bree,i know. i'm gonna take him to the hospital.
1282,Bree,we discussed this. we agreed to go slowly.
2939,Bree,which is just down the street. i'll be right back.
3746,Bree,"well, technically, i'm she, but yes."
2523,Bree,"orson, what am i gonna do?"
2092,Bree,"i'm sorry. i just felt that if it were me, i"
3200,Bree,"oh, i'm glad you're enjoying yourself."
1300,Bree,george.
2892,Bree,all righty. here you go.
2429,Bree,i can't tell you right now. you're just gonna have to trust me. can you do that?
2434,Bree,your mother--she tried to kill me.
3843,Bree,look what got brought in with the dirty napkins.
3789,Bree,coco saugatuck. happy now?
102,Bree,"there. obviously, if you've forgotten anything, you can, um, come right back and get it."
1579,Bree,"well,then i suggest you get a job."
598,Bree,no.
2439,Bree,"oh, i didn't."
473,Bree,"george, hi, it's me, bree. i was wondering, are you free next saturday?"
1892,Bree,"i am trying to leave, and these morons won't let me.do you know that you can be arrested for kidnapping,for detaining someone?!"
2032,Bree,"orson, you can't imagine that we are still going!"
2059,Bree,"and you're not being hard enough. stop saying that what i did was understandable, i'm a mother who abandoned her child.that's-- unnatural."
4056,Bree,"orson, we've been robbed."
2494,Bree,he's such a scamp.
515,Bree,i don't think that would be wise.
2805,Bree,"well, i guess i'll just have to take my veal scaloppini and go home."
1592,Bree,emancipated?
1479,Bree,"oh, honey."
3976,Bree,oh. and then you bumped it on that nasty curb.
1044,Bree,thank you.
1107,Bree,"no, it's not. all the things that andrew's been saying, the way he's been acting, it's all connected to his father's death and it's clear to me that i need to spend more time focusing on him and his needs."
4092,Bree,"isn't it? i'm being blackmailed by a man i'm starting to despise, and if i don't pretend to love him, he can have me arrested."
618,Bree,"danielle, you are president of the abstinence club."
393,Bree,fine. why do you ask?
699,Bree,no!
1201,Bree,what's wrong?
1569,Bree,"no!the only problem i have is with your children.they're incorrigible because you let them run amok.and if i hadn't drifted off,they would have waited until i was in the bathroom or stuck on the phone or upstairs doing laundry."
98,Bree,"so, uh, where are you going?"
1120,Bree,"andrew, what are you doing?"
1927,Bree,his mother told me what happened. it's true.
3145,Bree,"lynette, i wish i had time to be more tactful, but i don't. your swan is pathetic, and i'm firing you from napkin duty."
409,Bree,"i see."" ""you know, you are pretty brazen for a woman who just admitted, however tacitly, that she just slept with my husband. if i told anyone in this neighborhood, they would never speak to you again."
360,Bree,"no, i don't."
1766,Bree,"well, that's not your life anymore."
491,Bree,"george, you shouldn't have."
1610,Bree,"gosh, um--i'm not exactly sure."
3714,Bree,"you mean, with my life? i don't know."
957,Bree,"he's going to do more than mention it. that's the part he'll focus on. in fact, i think three anecdotes from rex's childhood is more than enough."
1292,Bree,"uh, yes, i am."
1676,Bree,"no! no,i-i don't feel like i'm gonna drink.and if i did,i certainly would call donna.i mean,she and i are just--we're just really clicking."
744,Bree,"sorry, i didn't know. it won't happen again. of course, i'm a somewhat surprised you don't hit them, i mean everyone knows they're a little bit out of control."
764,Bree,"our son has just told us that he might be gay. there are two hundred other boys in this kamp. now i could explain to you what might happen if we left him here, but i'm a lady and i don't use that kind of language."
3282,Bree,oh. well--in that case--
1395,Bree,"oh.bye, sweetie."
731,Bree,you know pictures are prettier if you colour inside the lines.
496,Bree,the memory of this night will stay with you forever.
2728,Bree,wait. did you have that final scan?
600,Bree,"honey, you have to talk to him."
4035,Bree,must you be so crude?
267,Bree,this was the johnson boy?
1408,Bree,her gardener.
1560,Bree,i most certainly was not.
3005,Bree,who knew you were so insightful?
1589,Bree,"for the record,i did not punch my son.i slapped him with an open palm."
419,Bree,"i'm here to see rex van de kamp.apparently, he had a heart attack."
1571,Bree,"i'm really well.um,i just saw you all talking before lynette went off to work.what were you all talking about?"
3527,Bree,"oh, that's all right. i can wait. mmm, he looks so peaceful."
3699,Bree,you use my cookbook to balance your table?
3075,Bree,"well, good, when they drop by for their inspection, i'll just have to have a nice little chat with them, too."
3816,Bree,"maybe i can help. my publisher is thinking about doing his advertising in-house, and he's been looking for someone."
1795,Bree,what a shame.i really wanted him to have a chance to get to know you guys.
1105,Bree,"but, zach is mary alice's son. he grew up playing in our yards. if he has any hope of surviving, i have to believe he's better off here than on the street."
1832,Bree,"stop!one of the candles went out.um, we're gonna have to do this all over again.i'm sorry. i'll be right back."
3986,Bree,i-i may have overstated things when i described my husband as a decent man. he actually has a wide variety of psychological problems.
1605,Bree,"perception is reality, andrew."
2321,Bree,"um, actually,we have a guest."
459,Bree,"well, we're just, um, talking. mr. williams took me out to dinner."
2726,Bree,"orson, you better take benjamin to the other room before my friends run out of lies. ah."
759,Bree,what?
1536,Bree,"caleb and i had, uh,a very lovely chat. yes."
2084,Bree,she told me she got it from wearing someone else's bathing suit.
471,Bree,"andrew, you will not speak that way about your father in front of me."
1919,Bree,do you?
1488,Bree,i wanted to talk to you about what happened the other day with the kids.
734,Bree,"well, then i will fix you a very nice bowl of peaches and cottage cheese."
34,Bree,"it's a letter, addressed to mary alice."
1063,Bree,it's the quickest way to prove to the police that they're wrong.
2199,Bree,"i had to tell her. she hurt me, so i hurt her back. if anything should happen to julie or lynette--"
2210,Bree,"orson, what's the big deal? it's just an address."
3489,Bree,"what? well, who is it then?"
1439,Bree,"we have these,um,new neighbors--the applewhites.it's a mother and her son. they just moved here from chicago.and they seem very nice.but there's--there's something about them that's--off.they're--odd."
3581,Bree,"yes. if he's a part of your life, i want to get to know him. i think i'll serve fish."
3953,Bree,how?
3020,Bree,excuse me?
391,Bree,yeah. people do terrible things when they think no one is watching them.
1570,Bree,i will not be spoken to like that.i just won't.
921,Bree,"oh, i was just, um, thinking that i need to start, uh, spring cleaning."
1529,Bree,downstairs?
3685,Bree,i tried. he won't listen to me.
2277,Bree,"it's fun looking back at the past, isn't it?"
787,Bree,"about four weeks old. i never told you this, but when i gave birth to you, there were complications. the umbilical chord wrapped around your neck and you stopped breathing. the room got very quiet, and i knew you were in trouble. so i turned to the doctor and i very calmly said that he was not to worry about me, that his job was to save your life. when i say i would die for you, that's not just an expression. i mean it."
3667,Bree,i don't think i do that.
1720,Bree,"well,i have to admit,i was a bit upset at first.but then it hit me.you're his grandparents. you should bond,get to know the real andrew."
2630,Bree,"oh, for god sakes, phyllis, it's not as if we got along when rex was alive."
1722,Bree,"oh,shoot! i wish you hadn't gone through that.now we have to have an unpleasant conversation,and we were having such a nice time."
1345,Bree,"george, i know what you did to dr. goldfine. and i can see now just how sick you really are, so please just turn yourself in and that way you can get the help that you really need. george!"
3580,Bree,"well, i want to know now, so that's why i'm having you and alex over to dinner tomorrow night."
2301,Bree,you're right--
2495,Bree,we are not throwing in the towel over a minor mishap.
2593,Bree,it's not about you. i've just been going through some things.
1164,Bree,"well, i thought we were going to let the duck digest a bit more, but what the heck."
632,Bree,"oh, are you going steady?"
2424,Bree,and you say he's just down the hall?
298,Bree,"we have to get rid of the car. but we can't sell it. the police might find it, and there could be dna. we take the car to a bad part of town. we'll leave the keys in the ignition and the doors unlocked. if the police don't find it, we'll get the insurance money, and if they do, it wasn't in our possession. anyone could have hit mrs. solis."
390,Bree,"you know, if you really have that many doubts, you should go buy a hidden camera."
824,Bree,see? you were worried for nothing.
1318,Bree,"ty, would you like to dance?"
944,Bree,"yes, that is rex's mother."
2135,Bree,so--what do we owe you for all this progress?
1123,Bree,"the police dug up your father today.they think that somebody was poisoning him.apparently,i'm a suspect."
3161,Bree,katherine? it's bree. we need to talk now!
2517,Bree,"well, i would be more than happy to go with you."
3755,Bree,"uh, take your time. i'm sorry. we haven't been introduced. i'm bree hodge, part owner."
930,Bree,"and for the record, you are gonna come through this operation just fine."
3484,Bree,"orson, we don't need to know."
2154,Bree,"well, thank you, darling. but if you think for one second that i'm gonna break bread with that malicious, pill-popping shrew, you're out of your mind."
2926,Bree,"lynette, i-i realize you don't have much experience with churches, so this really isn't your fault."
3123,Bree,"oh, dear lord."
3702,Bree,"if you would just take on a few more patients, we could afford it."
3398,Bree,"i'm saying, maybe you should reconsider joining the company."
3612,Bree,"yes. which reminds me, that needs to be back by 3:00.could you?"
1659,Bree,do you have any idea what you might say?
1565,Bree,"you know,i think,um,i must have been cleaning the kitchen,and i-i just didn't hear them because of the noise from the dishwasher."
2223,Bree,"well, i have a better idea. why don't you tell him yourself?"
3502,Bree,the reporter's almost here. i am so nervous.
1327,Bree,i don't think we are any more.
2755,Bree,"do you think, while you're here, do could do a bris for my baby, too?"
2003,Bree,"men have lied to me before. believe me, it'ill never happen again."
3977,Bree,"hmm. and that's all you were doing, just going out for a walk?"
258,Bree,"well, then, if that is the case, then take me, right here, right now. the house is spotless. there aren't any burritos lying around to pull my focus--"
3886,Bree,"yes, am i speaking to mr. dinsmore? ah, this is bree van de kamp. yes, it's nice to talk to you, too. well, as i'm sure you're aware, your company has made several offers to purchase mine. yes, i know i said i wasn't interested, but some things have happened in my personal life and i think i'm ready to--finally make a deal. really? well, that's wonderful. why don't you, uh, come to my office tomorrow and we'll talk? good-bye, mr. dinsmore."
3237,Bree,"orson, please don't be hurt. i am under so much pressure and so terrified i'll fail that i don't even know what i'm saying half the time. just let me get through this. as soon as the plates go out tonight, i will come home and cook you that pot roast i promised. okay?"
3027,Bree,will someone please tell me what's going on?
1497,Bree,"uh, now is actually not a good time for me."
1085,Bree,andrew! you are not leaving the house dressed like that.
2676,Bree,that's a nice picture of rex.
3039,Bree,very well. so do you want the cat or not?
2472,Bree,that is so kind of you.
2878,Bree,puff pastry?
2647,Bree,"well, it was mary alice, but as you may have heard--"
1915,Bree,"anything at all.as you said, i--i have a lot of issues."
919,Bree,mm-hmm.
955,Bree,"phyllis, these are all things that happened to rex before he went to college."
3113,Bree,reverend green!
895,Bree,you heard that?
2078,Bree,"howard keck? oh, that's ridiculous. he's got a wife and a daughter. he plays on tom scavo's bowling team."
847,Bree,"okay, this is exactly what i was afraid of. george and i are just friends."
6,Bree,"this is half the reason i joined the nra. well, when rex started going to those medical conferences, i wanted at the back of his mind that he had a loving wife at home, with a loaded smith and wesson."
577,Bree,huh?
2299,Bree,good. let me know if there are any survivors.
162,Bree,"it's just that i'm very well respected at barcliff, and my word won't be good there anymore."
3471,Bree,"i don't see why not. i mean, everything's, uh, pretty much done here. you can go now if you like."
3208,Bree,"thank you, dear. orson, what do you think?"
396,Bree,yeah. but i['d still buy that camera.
1510,Bree,"well, i'm not sure,but i think maxine had a slave."
1667,Bree,"peter,all we did was kiss."
853,Bree,"what do you think, rex? i chose green so that it will work whether gabrielle has a boy or a girl."
775,Bree,would you like some water? i have flat or bubbly.
69,Bree,it's just-i miss you.
2780,Bree,"oh, give it some time. we're still adjusting, and benjamin is sleeping so soundly."
1021,Bree,"well, i got that, but why? why would they do that?"
950,Bree,"hi. i would have been over sooner to introduce myself, but i'm afraid there's been a death in my family."
2694,Bree,"you always say that like it's something to be proud of, but the day i see even a glimmer of myself in you is the day that i realize you've finally started-- to grow up."
125,Bree,"andrew, just because i chose not to share my marital problems with you does not give you the right to be rude."
1402,Bree,"to be honest, i don't think i would've liked it, either."
1239,Bree,hey. we'd better hurry. the movie starts in twenty minutes.
538,Bree,"i'm not. the coffee is just dreadful. well, it's late, and i needed to get out of the house, and it was the only place still open."
3138,Bree,"oh! yes, i'm sorry. one cherub delivered at 1:30."
268,Bree,"rex, this was practically assault."
1305,Bree,"fluoxetine, one hundred milligrams. risperidone, two fifty milli-- i'm sorry. what is this?"
2634,Bree,and--and you told her?!
3468,Bree,"ooh! oh, this counter's hard on my head."
2807,Bree,"seriously, andrew, you don't even have a bed."
2702,Bree,"cher, the beloved pop diva."
96,Bree,if everybody would please take your seats. dinner is served.
3238,Bree,hmm.
2572,Bree,"we, we certainly didn't mean to pry. let me just tinge that up for you."
3016,Bree,hire us? but we're not a business.
1453,Bree,"a sobriety test? i'm not taking any sobriety--test.this behavior stems from the hurt feelings of a man with very low self-esteem.the world is a big place,and i'm sure there is a woman out there somewhere who'll respond to your macho posturing."
2014,Bree,did you kill your wife? susan talked to that carolyn woman. why didn't you tell me that the police searched your house?
2411,Bree,"and this, after he'd been in a coma because some lunatic ran him over."
2867,Bree,"walter. walter. walter, i'm begging you. please. i'm living like a vagabond in a teenage girl's bedroom. i'm sleeping under a poster of orlando bloom. you can't leave me."
2394,Bree,"oh, i knew it. these are sleeping pills, and these are--oh, my god. you raped my husband!"
352,Bree,why?
3312,Bree,"girls, you are making way too much of this. i am not a bit more fabulous than any one of you. excuse me."
1132,Bree,thank you. you don't know how much this means to me. i've realized looking back that i was still in shock during rex's first funeral. i don't think it had quite hit me yet what had happened so that's why this small ceremony means so much to me. because i realize now that this is the last chance i'm gonna have to say goodbye.
3199,Bree,"and now to finish, you simply transfer your spun sugar to the croquembouche and gracefully drape it around in a delicate swirl. did i mention that you--probably shouldn't be wearing jewelry while working with spun sugar? um--well, there's no law that says it has to be a delicate veil. i mean, it could really just be a beautiful, um, little, uh, white--ribbon. turn off the damn camera."
3551,Bree,"all right, but i think i'll be too tired to finish it. that pill i took really kicked in fast."
1229,Bree,"see, i thought we were going to a yard sale."
737,Bree,"well, i'm not your mommy and if you mess around in my house you will get spanked. now be good."
1426,Bree,"yeah, it seems obvious."
3428,Bree,"my god, he's still there."
3142,Bree,don't you dare throw your calligraphy skills in my face when you know i'm at a low point. now go! and stop following me.
3346,Bree,"well, you're--entitled to think so, but i don't."
2515,Bree,"well, did we or did we not agree that i would bring the dessert?"
123,Bree,"andrew, don't change the subject."
1669,Bree,"but,peter--"
667,Bree,"well, you should have thought of that before you left a personal check on maisy gibbons' nightstand."
53,Bree,"uh, yeah, i'm sure."
416,Bree,i know you still love me. maisy told me.
3637,Bree,"who, undoubtedly, already have doctors, just like your patients in fairview have you."
2487,Bree,"i mean,it's one thing to forgive bad behavior. it's another thing to reward it.there are consequences for her mistakes."
3955,Bree,do you really mean that?
1507,Bree,"oh, come on. do you honestly expect us to believe that you had the time to prepare a 6-course meal for 10 women?even i couldn't make this and i have time to get ready for a party"
36,Bree,"well if it was a joke, it was in very poor taste."
1738,Bree,"no, he did not say."
3048,Bree,he spent the night here?
668,Bree,"rex. if you walk out of this restaurant, i will scream."
1788,Bree,"sorry,i don't know what's taking danielle so long to get dressed."
3624,Bree,"melina, this is childish!"
2838,Bree,"well, adam is not here, and there is a tornado coming. and as you may have gleaned from the batteries and bottled water, that bathroom is where we are planning on riding it out. so would you please be a dear and come on out?"
113,Bree,gabby!!
1362,Bree,'those are my panties.how did you--''
2644,Bree,"phyllis, wait!"
172,Bree,you're right. that was hard to hear.
420,Bree,"well, then he can go to a motel because he's not allowed back in my house."
1074,Bree,andrew. what are you doing?
3207,Bree,"now it's just a mock-up, but this is what the book is going to look like."
800,Bree,"it's true that we dated during the separation, but george and i are just friends now, aren't we?"
2731,Bree,"and you'd better apply now. debbie gottlieb had her baby the same day i did, and she could only get wait-listed at her first three choices. oh, by the way, we were invited to her bris this saturday."
1022,Bree,unless what?
2718,Bree,"i need your services as a doctor, but before i tell you what's going on, i need you to promise that what you're about to learnmwill be kept in strictest confidence."
2725,Bree,"okay, baby. it's okay, little one. here we are. here we go. yes, here we go."
2651,Bree,"hi. it's, uh, mrs. hodge. may i please speak with danielle?"
3631,Bree,"mmm. you're sweet. oh, all right. get the lace tablecloth. i will pretend to like this woman. just like i pretended to like nana."
198,Bree,"and tell them what? we don't even have the note anymore, we gave it to paul."
3192,Bree,"katherine, i'm blushing."
189,Bree,"yes,you're probably right."
2246,Bree,"what did she mean by, you can't afford not to? was she threatening you with something?"
682,Bree,"andrew, you almost killed another human being!"
760,Bree,"well, he was right. i'll be waiting in the car."
2433,Bree,andrew? danielle?
3636,Bree,i'm sure they could. it's too bad your practice is all the way down here.
3376,Bree,"um, actually, dear--"
4003,Bree,so?
413,Bree,it went well. the surgeon says you're going to be as good as new.
3129,Bree,"ladies, i don't know what you're talking about. katherine has all sorts of wonderful qualities."
1956,Bree,"wow, we certainly devoured that ice cream.can i get you anything else?"
556,Bree,yeah.
3675,Bree,"well, it's just that grilling is such a manly pastime. if i suggested that orson somehow failed to produce the perfect steak, you might see it as another example emasculation."
2080,Bree,please don't cut into that pie. i made it for mike.
1778,Bree,"honey,you've got to eat something."
986,Bree,my electrician? why were you on the phone sobbing to my electrician?
684,Bree,"well, glad that you asked."
954,Bree,"oh. well, um, what kind of input?"
3627,Bree,"oh, andrew thought it would be nice to have a formal dinner tomorrow night."
3903,Bree,"know you're disappointed right now, but you have to know, i really do want to find some way for you to be happy."
1135,Bree,"i'm here, sweetheart, and i'm gonna take care of everything. but you knew that, didn't you? you've always known that you can count on me."
3865,Bree,that's not yours?
3295,Bree,and you think that's my fault?
3893,Bree,"andrew, do you know why my book sold so well? because it was authentic. i actually believe in the old-fashioned values i wrote about. i believe in men opening doors for ladies and children respecting their elders. i also believe that sometimes women need to make sacrifices for their husbands. i would be the worst kind of hypocrite if i preached these values and then didn't follow them myself."
265,Bree,i will be right in.
165,Bree,hi.
2063,Bree,"oh, i'm not talking about a lie--just a polite fiction to explain to everybody where you've been. i mean, we can't possibly tell them that you've been living on skid row, sleeping in a cardboard box."
1062,Bree,"no, that's why i need you to take the polygraph, too."
2765,Bree,"i gave them very serious consideration. but it's my blood running in his veins, which ultimately makes it my decision."
2681,Bree,hello.
2618,Bree,"oh, that's all right. i've got them, mr. knievel."
3839,Bree,bruce's tape recorder.
597,Bree,"well, then, whose is it? it didn't just magically appear in my laundry basket."
622,Bree,"oh, sweetheart, just because you give a boy sex doesn't mean you'll get love in return."
1643,Bree,i don't know.i guess i'm just impatient to get on with my life.
2802,Bree,i'm sorry. i don't--i don't understand. why are you doing this?
876,Bree,i told you in confidence. how dare you throw it back in my face.
1449,Bree,i am not giving you anything.except the bill.
692,Bree,you talk to him all you want. i'm gonna check out the place with the electrified fence.
2287,Bree,i can't. not yet. i need some time to think.
2185,Bree,harvey cheated?
357,Bree,oh. what was it about?
3866,Bree,"uh, i don't know. but, you know, there it is."
506,Bree,"okay, now i want you to hold the gun like you're holding a beautiful white dove. hold it firmly enough that it can't get away, but not so firmly that you can kill it. got it?"
2448,Bree,"well, i am gonna call her tonight and have a little talk with her about common courtesy, and i'm sure that you will get an e-mail first thing tomorrow morning. well, we should go. i've got to get that bracelet to gaby before the wedding."
4043,Bree,wow.
1653,Bree,really?peter! but--but--you forgot your shirt!
3231,Bree,isn't it amazing?
3076,Bree,family?
3485,Bree,"oh, my."
1995,Bree,"well, orson and i talked about it and we just feel at our age, it's silly to wait. and with your help, i'm sure we can get it all done."
117,Bree,andrew?!
1950,Bree,"oh, all right.i wanted to wait and make a proper announcement, but--"
1301,Bree,"i'm sorry to drop by unannounced, but i just had this disturbing visit from an old friend of yours. a leila mitzman."
2670,Bree,"well, actually, we checked into the curriculum, and it's very strong, but no matter. you're be happier here."
587,Bree,"so, it's like we're in a little play."
66,Bree,"well, i care. they don't need to be burdened with our marital problems, and if we're working things out, the least we could do is try to keep up appearances."
1635,Bree,i would rather not discuss it right now.
858,Bree,"i think that as soon as you're well enough we should go on a vacation. take a trip, go somewhere fun. remember our trip to italy?"
2353,Bree,a house?
2932,Bree,"yes, i'm gonna run some errands, and orson's gonna take benjamin to the park."
3384,Bree,"uh, yes. he's going to read a lot of classic books, maybe study a language."
3841,Bree,what do you call this?
1376,Bree,"andrew, that is not fair."
1448,Bree,"you know what?i politely rejected you,and now you're getting your revenge by embarrassing me."
3858,Bree,i'll take care of it.
1645,Bree,"well,it's just my way of saying thank you for everything you've done for me over the past few weeks.what's-- wrong?"
1102,Bree,george! george!
2696,Bree,ugh! i hate possums.
1748,Bree,excuse me.excuse me.may i ask you something?
1059,Bree,"so because of the anomalies in rex's blood, the police started to wonder if i'd been poisoning rex."
662,Bree,"rex, this might sound silly, but are people staring at us?"
1286,Bree,"yes, we did. now, when the time comes to go public with our relationship, i need you to discuss it with me first. i'm the bride, after all. it's only appropriate."
983,Bree,"come on, phyllis. let's get you something to eat."
3533,Bree,"yes, it is. sit down. we need to talk."
2112,Bree,"well, that hardly bolsters his suitability. danielle, please, eat something."
1706,Bree,do you really think that i am a failure as a parent?
1825,Bree,"oh, susan,did i wake you?"
2297,Bree,at his office. and what did you think you'd find there anyway?
1746,Bree,"not yet.you obviously have an encyclopedic grasp of everything deaved.but clearly, you don't have the slightest idea about the power of a loving relationship."
3265,Bree,"um-- let me be clear. i do no want him calling me ""bree."""
2599,Bree,dead?
4024,Bree,what? no!
3356,Bree,where are you? it's after 2:00.
3773,Bree,"lynette, stop. wait. please. don't be this way. i don't want money to get in the way of our friendship."
18,Bree,"andrew, danielle, napkins?"
2217,Bree,"well, i must say, i'm surprised at how lucid you are. orson led me to believe--"
3710,Bree,you think i'm just like every other housewife?
1739,Bree,edie!
2621,Bree,"uh, guys--what did i tell you?"
3271,Bree,"well, this isn't just about nutrition. do you want him to be teased at school every time he pulls tofu out of his lunchbox?"
3931,Bree,you're right. i shouldn't have asked. i know it's horrible here.
794,Bree,"oh, my heavenly days. rex, look, it's george."
294,Bree,"oh, andrew, thank god you're back. i need your help, honey. there's been an accident. andrew?"
1047,Bree,yes.
3135,Bree,"all right, you can all wipe those smug looks off your faces, because every one of you has just become my employee."
664,Bree,"no, i think they're laughing at you. i think they feel sorry for me, which is just as mortifying."
999,Bree,"hi. oh, hi, lynette."
1155,Bree,"i have done nothing to be forgiven for! i was a fantastic wife! when he was sick, i nursed him. when we were low on money, i stayed within a budget. i cooked his meals, i mended his clothes. for the love of god, i used to check his back for acne. and that miserable son of a bitch has the nerve to understand and forgive me! well, the joke's on him because i do not understand and i do not forgive!"
3383,Bree,"andrew, please."
2801,Bree,you're moving out? but you can't afford an apartment.
2785,Bree,you're leaving our bed?
2398,Bree,we have to do something.
323,Bree,"andrew, um, i know the last few days have been stressful, and, uh, you know, if you ever need to talk to anybody--"
533,Bree,because you were unfaithful.
1764,Bree,you can't possibly be turned on by what's going on out there.
425,Bree,"fine. i will see him through this, but after that, your father can rot in hell for all i care!"
2752,Bree,and this rotating spice rack? those little airplane bottles of vodka fit perfectly in the back.
362,Bree,you are strung out!
3455,Bree,sit.
2597,Bree,no. this early?
1506,Bree,"maxine, once again,this entire lunch was just out of this world. i just have to get the number of your caterer."
142,Bree,"i'm staying for the show. i'm dying to see what all the fuss is about. excuse me, waitress, i'll have a glass of your house chardonnay."
1937,Bree,how sweet and-- unexpected.do you wanna come in?
4074,Bree,no. all i want is out.
1139,Bree,"oh, please don't talk to me about tests. rex was not poisoned and no one i know believes that he was."
1202,Bree,"well, i'm not gonna get another rash just by holding your hand."
2105,Bree,"good afternoon. i'm, uh, bree hodge, and you are?"
3776,Bree,this is a delicious snack. did you make this?
2628,Bree,i'm going to mingle.
89,Bree,"well, i wanted to invite you and your father to a dinner party tomorrow night."
1339,Bree,"i just hope you don't expect too much from this relationship. i mean aside from dna, you might find that you don't have that much in common."
1533,Bree,a girl?
3423,Bree,"well, let's talk about food. with a new client, what i usually do is discuss possible menus, and then i have my very best chef prepare a sample dinner."
483,Bree,"hello! oh, hi, lynette! what?"
463,Bree,the only reason he is still in the house is because you insisted i care for him.
1853,Bree,that would be nice.
2028,Bree,"yes, mr. hodge."
2983,Bree,she's not my boss!
3121,Bree,they're a little late getting started.
2098,Bree,i am so tired of feeling like the worst mother who ever lived.
2535,Bree,just--give me the recipe!
2611,Bree,not without a helmet.
1747,Bree,"well,i think peter is a better man than you do,and i am not gonna let you keep us apart."
3246,Bree,"yes, and i'm pretty sure that elderly woman with him was his mother!"
3800,Bree,"no, i'm just saying you're worth--less. i'm sorry, honey. i'm just being honest."
979,Bree,thank you.
1181,Bree,"well, susan did say that he murdered mrs. huber, so my vote would be yes."
548,Bree,"you are such a special man, george williams. and you deserve such a special woman."
3107,Bree,"oh, this is a bit awkward, but my soon-to-be ex just walked in. he's been following me everywhere."
563,Bree,"once, and you should've seen the look in his eyes. he was terrified that i'll figure it out. you know what it is, don't you?"
2510,Bree,"will not be needed. as i said, i always bring dessert."
3205,Bree,the cooking show agreed to redo my segment. i wanna make sure it's perfect this time.
3880,Bree,why would you want to hurt me?
796,Bree,i would love to. rex?
275,Bree,"but whatever problems your father and i have, it doesn't change the fact that we love you very, very much,"
3170,Bree,"well, that's no surprise. my pies are always perfect."
2595,Bree,"yeah, everything's fine, but, uh, there was just a time where i thought i might lose it."
3751,Bree,lynette. i understand you and your fellow chefs will be serving my four cheese pizza tonight.
3280,Bree,"well, because she's all grown-up. you see, hot dogs and hamburgers are what make little boys and girls grow up to be big and strong. and now that she's grown-up, she doesn't need them anymore."
1016,Bree,it's right down this row.
1404,Bree,"you know, the affair."
3463,Bree,"well done, orson!"
1949,Bree,i'm not being coy.
2196,Bree,is she all right?
1058,Bree,"well, for starters, you can help me prove to the police that we didn't conspire to kill my husband."
828,Bree,"no, he doesn't hate you. he hardly knows you, and you don't even really know him."
1502,Bree,hi. come on in.
227,Bree,she!
2836,Bree,"be that as it may, i really think you should go now."
244,Bree,"it's a little chilly out here, do you mind if we discuss this inside?"
2746,Bree,what's that supposed to mean? you don't trust me?
848,Bree,you've got the wrong idea. that man is my pharmacist!
729,Bree,bring them in.
2942,Bree,"oh, please. mowing your lawn in a notre dame sweatshirt doesn't make you catholic. you're presbyterian now. come on. let's go."
2886,Bree,"and poor walter just had his heart broken, so if it takes you being nice to him to get our house fixed, then--"
1103,Bree,i'm still recovering from mike is zach's real father.
1372,Bree,that's andrew back from camp hennessey. i've got to go.
2693,Bree,"i'm just saying, if i were you, i might be feeling--"
1944,Bree,yes.
2903,Bree,this is a conversation that could benefit from some homemade chocolate chip cookies.
1026,Bree,"an autopsy? detective, rex died of a heart attack."
433,Bree,you always say the nicest things.
57,Bree,"well, think about it. he grew up in the late 1800's, there were no appliances back then. his mother had to do everything by hand, just backbreaking work from sunup to sundown. not to mention the countless other sacrifices she probably had to make to take care of her family. and what does he do? he grows up and becomes famous, peddling a theory that the problems of most adults can be traced back to something awful their mother has done. there you go."
4053,Bree,"and do you say that to every woman, too?"
3563,Bree,"yes, my book is about food and families and how food brings families together when they make food. it's mothers teaching daughters how to cook. so i'm gonna cook pancakes with my daughter, only she's not here because she grew up and stole my baby. so--who wants to be my daughter?"
21,Bree,um. think i'll go get your salad for you.
3298,Bree,it's how i'm known.
941,Bree,what a waste.
1495,Bree,"lynette, hi, it's bree.uh, listen,call me when you get this message,and please come to poker tonight.i have some big news about the applewhites."
680,Bree,"gabby, this is the way i see it -- good friends offer to help in a crisis. great friends don't take no for an answer."
964,Bree,"i am not kidding. i will go nondenominational so fast, it will make your head spin."
934,Bree,"but his operation, it's not until tomorrow."
778,Bree,"then what are we supposed to do? just stand by while he starts dating boys? and by the way, the correct word is not gay, it's sodomy."
1826,Bree,"well,i'm sorry about the noise.it's just that danielle doesn't want balloons,and i'm kind of pressed for time."
1611,Bree,now why would you say that?
1297,Bree,"yes, it is. to have a complete stranger come into my home, drink my tea, and then try to turn me against one of the sweetest men i have ever known."
2126,Bree,"orson's right. we need to support each other as a family. in fact, i say we all go for counseling."
381,Bree,"you are unhappy with our sex life.you're not getting something from me,but you're simply too afraid to ask."
1959,Bree,does that change our core values?
303,Bree,we can only hope.
3706,Bree,"i want a new stove, rex, and if i need to get a job to pay for it, so be it."
3859,Bree,"ah, you're a lifesaver!"
441,Bree,can we talk about something else - something less depressing?
880,Bree,"yeah, good point."
3490,Bree,katherine!
2438,Bree,"hello, ladies."
147,Bree,so what's your strategy? are you just never going to speak to me again?
3327,Bree,aw.
1831,Bree,"people care about details.someday when danielle looks back,i want her to remember just how perfect her cake looked and how hard her mother worked to make her happy.this cake is a symbolof my love."
3606,Bree,you do?
4101,Bree,are you insane? your thug tried to strangle him.
2811,Bree,"oh, andrew."
550,Bree,"why, what's wrong?"
2888,Bree,"watch your mouth. i would never suggest that. you can raise a man's hopes without satisfying them. i've done it all my life. andrew, i have got to get back into my house, and you're my only hope."
3831,Bree,maybe we should slice the tart in here. i don't want to bring a large knife in this.
335,Bree,"lynette, you're a great mother."
1041,Bree,"well, apparently, i'm a suspect. well, they always look at spouses first. it has something to with statistics. it's just a formality. i'll be cleared in no time. would you two please stop looking at me like that? obviously, i did not kill your father. i loved him deeply."
1422,Bree,andrew?would you mind turning off your video game?my lawyer would like to have a little chat with you.
1167,Bree,"no, no, no, it wasn't your kiss. i felt something weird on my neck."
1725,Bree,"oh,they,uh,they already left."
3266,Bree,"all right, orson. don't overexcite him on the upholstery. so, danielle, what would you like me to make as a side dish for your welcome home party? i can do anything so long as it complements beef tenderloin."
2978,Bree,who put pear slices in the waldorf salad?
388,Bree,"why, are you feeling ashamed?"
1923,Bree,"i would beg my son andrew for forgiveness for having given up on him, and i would tell my daughter not to worry, that i have a plan to protect her."
3243,Bree,gaby!
912,Bree,when i finish making the bed.
2716,Bree,how many rum punches did you have?
2740,Bree,i hope orson 's rant didn't give you a headache.
1551,Bree,"honey,you can't.they're at work."
340,Bree,"so, why isn't mrs. huber here?"
3088,Bree,"i reject your peace, and i demand you stop stalking me."
2577,Bree,it's private.
2222,Bree,"yes, i see. well, surely this rift isn't irreparable."
2294,Bree,i said i had concerns. concerns that have disappeared now that mike has been arrested.
2396,Bree,were you expecting this?
3307,Bree,"they've come up with this whole marketing plan--radio, print, book signings."
2270,Bree,we saw that woman at the morgue--on our wedding night. you pretended not to know her.
1012,Bree,and i appreciate that.
3983,Bree,"my husband is a decent man, and i want to do right by him."
339,Bree,you put a woman into a coma.surely that arouses some kind of emotion.
3876,Bree,"this isn't my problem, dr. bernstein. he's the sick one. fix him."
902,Bree,"rex, everybody is talking about our sex life. every sordid little detail right down to that box of perversions you keep in your closet."
1910,Bree,"oh, well, i certainly would not want that to happen.what's your name?"
3672,Bree,bring it.
2428,Bree,"yes, and i intend to go to the police."
1639,Bree,"no,it makes it sound like i think i have a problem,and i don't."
2204,Bree,i'm starting my cards early this year. it puts me in the mood to spread holiday cheer.
239,Bree,"of course, that's fine. shall i include the meal?"
2150,Bree,it's a souffl. and timing is everything.
3812,Bree,i'm sorry you have to go through this. it must be so hard.
3791,Bree,or taffy swallow. we moved around a lot and had three dogs.
2179,Bree,"then again, he probably wants some time to unpack."
819,Bree,"oh my goodness, well, this changes everything. a friend of mine is having a barbeque for her husband on saturday and i think you should come."
3696,Bree,gaby?
3968,Bree,death?
2841,Bree,i saw her weeping. i wanted to help.
1854,Bree,"hello.my name is bree van de kamp,and i'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation."
841,Bree,"but honey, we socialise with them. what am i going to say to helen?"
2033,Bree,my son is eating out of dumpsters!
1000,Bree,"no, no, not at all."
588,Bree,okay. so what's our control word?
3872,Bree,what are you hiding behind your back?
2142,Bree,"and don't even think about blaming me,'cause if you so much as mention that we spoke,i'll phone the police."
646,Bree,"uh, what just happened?"
2928,Bree,"well, typically, we sit there and let the preacher preach, and eventually, our questions are answered, and no one is humiliated."
3122,Bree,i have no idea. now if you'll please excuse me.
284,Bree,i said no.
580,Bree,"well, come on, this just reeks of unresolved childhood trauma."
2980,Bree,"""take over""? what in god's name have you done with my french onion soup?"
1151,Bree,"you know, it's so unpleasant i'd rather not get into it. have you seen these gravestones? some are from the eighteen hundreds. just fascinating."
1707,Bree,"justin,what happened?"
1483,Bree,danielle--
3676,Bree,"well, for all i know, telling orson his steak tastes like charcoal might be deballing him."
110,Bree,8 o'clock. sorry to interrupt. bye.
656,Bree,"maisy, i didn't mention it when you were having financial troubles because i thought it would embarrass you."
939,Bree,"oh, i'm just waiting for, uh, rex's mother. she's gonna be here any second."
3486,Bree,why? i'm embarrassed enough as it is.
350,Bree,"oh, good nannies are so hard to find."
3292,Bree,"all right, i'll concede the second one was clearly a mistake."
693,Bree,"well, does it?"
3342,Bree,"do you? because i see children crawling into ovens, hoping to see dinosaurs."
184,Bree,i adore the holidays. i never get depressed if there's a beautifully decorated tree to look at.
3878,Bree,"i'm sorry, but this is unacceptable. do you at least know why he steals? if there were some sordid childhood trauma we could blame it on, it would really help me out with the neighbors."
3162,Bree,it was an accident.
3900,Bree,tell your wife i will be doing that second book after all.
3639,Bree,"uh, no help needed. certainly nothing that would require your thumb."
552,Bree,"if you could just tell me what he told you,then i could fix the problem."
1782,Bree,"until they lock caleb up,i don't want you anywhere near that family."
3564,Bree,"well, my husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested."
3942,Bree,we felt we owed it to your mom.
3406,Bree,i don't recall ever hearing that name before.
1009,Bree,"i, i, i don't know how to bowl."
3306,Bree,"isn't this nice? they're running it next month in ""woman's day."""
2069,Bree,drama camp. a very prestigious drama camp.
2228,Bree,you'd never ask a magician how a trick is done.
201,Bree,"hello,zachery. are you free for dinner tonight?"
725,Bree,i don't feel guilty.
1728,Bree,"well,now that you can't afford to become emancipated,i guess you're gonna have to stay here with me."
3661,Bree,it's true. there's a reason the local car dealers send you a fruit basket every christmas. wow hush.
3334,Bree,"oh, well, i think the irises and the lilies could work together."
4032,Bree,fine! but do you have to do it with such relish?
544,Bree,"no, george, it's not okay. it was insensitive. i know how you feel about me, and i--"
2557,Bree,"ooh. here you go, but please don't mention my name. as i said, you know, he's overbooked, and i just don't want to get on his bad side."
2771,Bree,"he's fine, but i've been doing so reading, and more and more people say that babies sleep better next to their parents. it's called the ""family bed""."
1828,Bree,i'm fine. why?
2257,Bree,and what if you weren't? what if she had broken something and she was lying here for hours? you are coming home with us.
257,Bree,"you are unhappy with our sex life because you're not getting something from me, but you're simply too afraid to ask."
2070,Bree,what were you and andrew talking about today at the fair?
2700,Bree,"i suggest you get an air rifle. it won't kill it, but it'll sting it enough to keep it away for good."
1484,Bree,all i ever wanted was for you to be happy.
965,Bree,"no, i don't. if you heard the things that she said to me-"
2592,Bree,i am so sorry that i snapped at you tonight.
1685,Bree,it's a recent development. where's dad?
3407,Bree,80?!
2402,Bree,sexually. she had sex with you.
4016,Bree,why not?
2000,Bree,there'll be two hundred people staring at us.
2248,Bree,"oh, look, a highly motivated cockroach."
3420,Bree,have a seat.
2546,Bree,point well taken. i'll bring the wine.
3600,Bree,"the man is going to marry my son. if there is something about him i should know, i want to hear it now, please."
2320,Bree,so why have you come back?
2479,Bree,there's no need.the baby's just not kicking right now.
753,Bree,"yes, is it our turn?"
591,Bree,what's the matter with boise?
1578,Bree,"oh,well,if you need a ride to school, i'm happy to drive you."
981,Bree,"well, mr. pashmutti -"
3127,Bree,"no, that's all right. let him rest. but please take excellent care of him. he's a good man."
223,Bree,"thank you, i feel really good about it."
617,Bree,"well, good. but why on earth would you need a condom?"
3615,Bree,it's a pleasure to meet you.
3326,Bree,looks like somebody's job interview went well.
701,Bree,"what i want, what i have always wanted is for you to be happy. and you're not. and i have no idea how to help you."
3310,Bree,why?
3264,Bree,"yes, i'm aware of that. i picked it. i'm just concerned people might view it as a sign of, um, disrespect."
2072,Bree,"well, of course not. what is it?"
1540,Bree,tony?do you have to rush off?i thought maybe we could just chat for a minute.
3422,Bree,"my, that's a nice little terrace. we, we will throw you a party so special that you'll want us to cater your anniversary, too."
592,Bree,hmm. how about palestine?
861,Bree,"well, let's see i've beaten you to bridge, and mahjong and hearts. this is your last chance to redeem yourself."
2612,Bree,"uh, it's a lovely thought, but i really don't want a baby shower."
3844,Bree,do you know how embarrassed i would have bee if bruce had seen you take it?
494,Bree,"it's so lovely. i mean, look at the handle. is that mother of pearl?"
1633,Bree,"on second thought,i will have another glass of wine.you can leave the bottle."
573,Bree,"i'm sorry, rex. i thought i could pretend that this doesn't upset me anymore, but i can't."
4034,Bree,"i do the bare minimum. no more, no less."
1621,Bree,"well,i'm still appalled that you're helping my son with this ridiculous emancipation scheme,but you are a guest in my house,and guests get sandwiches."
3087,Bree,neither did i.
3249,Bree,"okay, you can fix this. just explain you're going to a different party here at the club and that you got confused. mrs. downing never has to know."
3441,Bree,then why are you whispering?
2221,Bree,and how do you disappoint him?
2827,Bree,would you like a nice cup of tea?
3400,Bree,"orson, stop throwing jail in my face. you cellmate was a crooked c.p.a., who helped you form a bridge club. it wasn't exactly attica."
3215,Bree,gaby--
2673,Bree,but you can't raise this child in a miami dorm room. you'll need to leave it with someone you can trust to take care of it properly.
2982,Bree,"oh, dear. well, i should throw this dip out."
2296,Bree,"we all have convictions, susan. i believe mike's last one was for manslaughter."
232,Bree,"oh, dear."
889,Bree,george. hi. what are you doing here?
2757,Bree,"yes, bree hodge--born rabinowitz."
4096,Bree,i had nothing to do with that.
2738,Bree,"oh, so you found the chocolate sauce?"
290,Bree,"darned if i know. uh, danielle, everything in the north quadrant of your side is clothes and books and such, and the south side are miscellaneous items."
1781,Bree,out of the question.
428,Bree,"yes, it is. the doctor said you could be here for weeks."
3950,Bree,do you at least know why he steals?
2013,Bree,"before we do this, there's something i need to ask you."
1142,Bree,where did you get this?
1749,Bree,"if a citizen,an ordinary citizen like myself,knew of someone holding a significant amount of drugs,what would my responsibilities be,you know, under the law?"
4104,Bree,i wanted to protect what was mine. you have turned into someone i don't recognize.
1562,Bree,"oh,truthfully,i haven't been able to get my mind off it.what a scare,huh?"
3959,Bree,"well, save it for those karaoke parties at bob and lee's. i am not amused."
316,Bree,we just want you to know how much we care.
327,Bree,"no, i won't, not until you tell me."
2386,Bree,excuse me?
3984,Bree,"well, i like to think of myself as a good person."
901,Bree,"forcing me to share in your depraved pasttime wasn't bad enough, you had to share my humiliation with your co-workers?"
2877,Bree,"oh, sure. just, uh, leave your trays in the hall when you're ready."
1296,Bree,"well, i don't know what to say."
1646,Bree,and that's a--a real thing?
715,Bree,"you don't know what it means to me, rex. it's been a long time since i felt i had a real partner. and it really helps, especially on a horrible morning like this."
1464,Bree,"actually,my car has been impounded by the police."
3006,Bree,"that's everything, i guess."
917,Bree,"we were having a fight when he had the heart attack, and i'm just feeling really guilty, because i should have gotten him here sooner and -"
803,Bree,george. what about him?
1517,Bree,"why should i?you betrayed this family,and you're not even sorry."
351,Bree,"oh lord, what do you want me to do?"
2519,Bree,"oh, it gets worse. her pie was better than mine."
3650,Bree,"oh, and i love you, too. orson, dear, would you pour melina another glass of wine?"
2236,Bree,"gloria, stop!"
1893,Bree,because my daughter is in danger.
586,Bree,good night.
675,Bree,"yes, and, and to tell you the truth, i'm a little insulted. i am a good friend. why would you feel like you have to hide that from me?"
2306,Bree,you had a child?
821,Bree,"well, you have to bring ginger, because if rex sees the two of you together, then he'll relax."
101,Bree,"umm, i can tell them that you went to tennis camp. that was a joke."
3967,Bree,"i'm surprised. i knew she was a bit dotty, but didn't think it was that serious."
2917,Bree,presbyterian.
4041,Bree,"well, i wonder if the victims of your kleptomania felt the same way."
1223,Bree,"oh. george, this is just, uh, an empty house. why is this a surprise?"
3783,Bree,i'm not discussing andrew's salary with you. it's none of your business.
3368,Bree,but that doesn't mean i look down on you.
1752,Bree,"well,cravings are cravings,and all you really need is a friend to call when you start having inappropriate thoughts,and i can be that friend."
1251,Bree,but you should know that. that's the kind of thing that people who are engaged are supposed to know about each other.
3911,Bree,"um, i ran into her once, unexpectedly--in a place i never thought i'd be."
1847,Bree,i take it you heard what happened.
429,Bree,"yes, it would--if i still felt anything for you. but as it stands, the place you used to occupy in my heart is very much empty now."
380,Bree,maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.
4075,Bree,what are you doing?
663,Bree,"well, i could be wrong, but i suspect that maisy gibbons' client list has been released."
2212,Bree,"but if she's only thirty minutes away, why haven't you been visiting her?"
1237,Bree,"yes, we saw aida last week and we both cried buckets. it was fun. george loves art, poetry, and music. it would be nice to be married to someone who looks for beauty in the world like i do. i don't know. that's why i'm here. i don't know what to do, dr. goldfine."
1072,Bree,"george, you're a very special friend, you are, but rex hasn't been dead four weeks so i think kissing on the lips is-"
2906,Bree,susan!
444,Bree,"it's a romantic date with a single attractive man, and i intend to french the hell out of him."
2160,Bree,carolyn knows tish?
185,Bree,"oh,zach. you know, my mother died when i was young. she was hit by a car."
3854,Bree,"i want you to explain to me why this insanity is still going on. when you stole that tape recorder, you said it was a onetime thing, an impulsive act of revenge."
3305,Bree,"yeah. oh, i almost forgot."
1780,Bree,"andrew,i am having peter over for dinner tomorrow night,and i was wondering if you would like to invite justin?"
1218,Bree,"oh, come on, that's a picture of your baby. you can't tell me you're not a little bit excited."
3511,Bree,why would i pay someone to do work that gives me such joy? now who wants a little snack?
1226,Bree,"uh, i do, i really do."
648,Bree,"hello, maisy."
2268,Bree,what?
3584,Bree,"oh, for god sakes, orson. let it go."
635,Bree,"i know my daughter. she's very determined, and unless you're really firm with her, she's going to continue to think that there's hope."
3703,Bree,such as?
3000,Bree,"i certainly, uh, wasn't expecting it."
3570,Bree,"you will. come along, orson."
3713,Bree,you were there?
1455,Bree,started?
595,Bree,"you promised the cheating had stopped, rex. you promised."
956,Bree,"well, don't you think it'd be nice if reverend devoted part of the eulogy to his life after he was married?"
2703,Bree,i expressly forbade her from coming tonight. who does she think she is?
58,Bree,good.
349,Bree,how many nannies did you interview?
1260,Bree,"but why? i mean, surely they have friends who have children."
3262,Bree,"now we have you for the whole weekend, right?"
714,Bree,for being here. for standing by me through this.
2875,Bree,"dinner will be ready shortly. oh, and, julie, i fixed the hem on that blue skirt of yours. it's on your bed."
1348,Bree,"hello, detective barton. this is bree van de kamp. i need to talk to you about george williams."
1109,Bree,but i only sent him there because his behavior at the time was so completely out of bounds.
3283,Bree,you have to promise not to tell your mommy.
3975,Bree,"well, that'll teach you to go out walking in the middle of the night. you know, i still don't know why you were out so late."
2007,Bree,i don't have time for this. i'm getting married now.
2066,Bree,we'll need a name for this drama camp.
3656,Bree,nonsense! it's a small price to pay to make your home more beautiful. i insist.
1066,Bree,i said no.
3829,Bree,"i'm going to put some coffee on. orson, would you give me a hand? let these three chat."
371,Bree,rex!
558,Bree,"yes. you know that's one of the things i hated most about our separation. not being able to throw dinner parties. there's just something so civilized and elegant about them, don't you think?"
1620,Bree,hello there!i thought you and your friend might like some snacks.
411,Bree,hey.
443,Bree,"rex, i don't want to say anything that might upset you. the doctor says any undue stress could cause another heart attack."
3009,Bree,"well, um, as much as i appreciate this naked display of emotion, you know how this sort of thing makes me uncomfortable."
1636,Bree,i'd prefer if you--didn't.
2045,Bree,"yes, very, and i'm worried sick about him."
2792,Bree,"okay. thanks. yes, um, we'll be going now."
2615,Bree,i really don't want a shower.
3524,Bree,"but it isn't, sandra, because i don't think i'm great. i have fallen down more times than i can count, just like so many other housewives out there, we're all just barely holding on, and we all think that we're alone. so maybe you're right. maybe it isn't a cookbook. it's a lifeline from me to those other women, because i want them to know there's always a chance to get something right. even if it's just a casserole."
2923,Bree,get the keys ready. we'll slip out the back.
1354,Bree,"i want to help you, but in order to do that, i need to forgive you, and, i can't do that until you admit what you've done."
1715,Bree,"i just got a massage at misty spring.things have been a little tense at home, and i needed an hour to relax."
712,Bree,"honey, it's going to be okay, i promise."
962,Bree,"oh, yes, i am. i am going to hire security, and those security men are going to have sticks and if you so much as set foot in that sanctuary, they will be instructed to beat you with those sticks"
3591,Bree,he's a plastic surgeon.
3255,Bree,"orson, i've been cooking all day. i-- i'm so tired, i can barely stand up. you really want me to make you a pot roast now?"
29,Bree,these need water.
2639,Bree,you wouldn't. think of danielle!
1505,Bree,i'll raise you.
2340,Bree,"amazing, isn't it, where some people's minds will go?"
1898,Bree,have they rung up your prescription yet?
3665,Bree,but?
1361,Bree,''more?''
3304,Bree,mmm. oh. mmm. you have a good day.
3093,Bree,and also with you. do not give this man peace.
1183,Bree,"paul, we've called the police."
1791,Bree,"right. good. um,sorry.everybody,dig in."
3523,Bree,"i wrote a cookbook, sandra-- meatloaf, pot pies, peach cobbler. why are you trying to crucify me?"
3114,Bree,"no, i told you. i was only trying to send a message to my ex."
3224,Bree,"okay, now i'm terrified."
367,Bree,because i want you to pull him from the swim team and i don't think you'll allow it without proof.
437,Bree,george? would you go out to dinner with me?
1279,Bree,"okay, well, uh, i will call you tonight and we'll figure out a time later in the week."
2440,Bree,"and miss gaby's wedding? no, i'll be fine."
2470,Bree,"no,i mean they're stickley.it means they have taste."
51,Bree,"oh. well, i wish he had called me."
3098,Bree,"you really want to be effective? try hollow points. these rounds you've got punch straight though, but a hollow point blooms on impact, cuts the body to shreds from the inside."
4087,Bree,"i had to. he found the storage unit. he wanted an explanation. i was in such a state of shock, i couldn't think of anything else to say."
2699,Bree,"well, unfortunately, our bleeding-heart town council forbids us from using live ammo in our own backyards."
3359,Bree,coupons?
2883,Bree,"oh, thanks, dear."
3470,Bree,"oh, much better."
3194,Bree,"oh, you poor dear. could someone please get some ice? oh, no."
1532,Bree,"oh, my god!sweetheart,i don't understand.why in the world would your mother treat you that way?"
2843,Bree,just come out! i'll get rid of her!
169,Bree,"oh,rex! that's not the point."
1444,Bree,"no,no,no,i think given the misunderstanding that i should get the bill."
2729,Bree,"oh, she adores him. she just felt terrible that she had to leave for school so soon."
2120,Bree,is my daughter all right?
3118,Bree,then let me send you a clear one. i am not attracted to you.
188,Bree,i've never told anyone that story before.
2594,Bree,"okay. um--i haven't told anybody this, but--it's, uh, about the baby. there have been some complications."
561,Bree,"i do want to forgive him doctor goldfine, but, there's something he's still not telling me."
3018,Bree,i think it's our creative friction that nearly caused me to poison you.
70,Bree,"lynette, these cards are sticky."
2962,Bree,this is not my pie.
923,Bree,how did you know that?
883,Bree,"edie, do you want to be a part of it?"
1277,Bree,how are you?
653,Bree,continue to be discreet.
1719,Bree,"all right,here we go.this is the last of andrew's things.once we tape up these boxes,we can start loading the car."
17,Bree,"rex. seeing as you're the head of this household, i would really appreciate you saying something."
3338,Bree,"well, you've only been looking for a few weeks. i mean, give it another-- say, month or two, and you still haven't found anything, then we'll revisit the idea. okay?"
3997,Bree,"i'm bringing you business, karl. try not to insult me."
1951,Bree,orson and i are engaged.
3031,Bree,i assume you'll want the pewter cat.
3770,Bree,my car!
927,Bree,"rex, you don't have to say anything."
3628,Bree,"for melina? she'd probably blow her nose on it. no, i will not let that woman defile nana's lace."
3446,Bree,"a cosmopolitan. that's your favorite, isn't it?"
3212,Bree,listen--van de kamp--hodge.
3530,Bree,robustly.
765,Bree,"exactly. so we'll get him home, we'll get him into christian counselling so it won't become a lifestyle."
2102,Bree,"you know, we never discussed what it was like for you while you were-- away. i just want you to know, if you ever wanna talk about it, there's nothing you can't tell me."
1863,Bree,"well, is there anything you'd like to say to my son?"
2960,Bree,"how's catholicism going, by the way?"
771,Bree,i'm making homemade bratwurst with sweet and sour cabbage. it's a recipe i found in an old german cook book.
149,Bree,i shouldn't have lied to you about your father. you and your sister are old enough to handle the truth and i'm sorry.
2414,Bree,"oh, thank god."
846,Bree,i beg your pardon?
696,Bree,"so, susan, what are you gonna do with the letter?"
133,Bree,where's your cell phone?
2635,Bree,"yes, and for the sake of her reputation, we've agreed to pretend that it's mine."
2657,Bree,"""emotionally unavailable."" gosh, i wonder where she picked up that little phrase."
1084,Bree,"all right then. george, we'll see you friday for dinner. i'll be serving fish."
2244,Bree,"well, your doctor has you on a low fat, low sodium diet. eight meals this week, eight times i've told you the same thing. so, who would like to say grace?"
757,Bree,yeah.
3803,Bree,"you know, katherine, if you need any help, i would be happy to make my fam--"
782,Bree,i'm upset because there is a problem here and no one seems to notice it but me.
1262,Bree,do you ever think you might like it?
2646,Bree,"of a the gay men in the world, we have to get the two without taste."
943,Bree,you're about to find out.
1604,Bree,"my name is bree,and i am an alcoholic."
2662,Bree,then why would she want the child?
2147,Bree,"i don't plan to. well, i hope this doesn't make history class too awkward."
3035,Bree,there is one thing.
385,Bree,"options! i'm not a mutual fund, rex!"
2366,Bree,"i try to hold my head up and smile and just bake more pies for the church social. but now your ex is camped out on our doorstep like i am hosting some kind of mormon slumber party, and i do not know how i am gonna bake my way out of this one!"
1322,Bree,"george, stop it."
3458,Bree,"you're more than ""like"" fired. you're fired. and, of course, we want our money back."
4095,Bree,you were assaulted?
2232,Bree,"please, stay for dessert. i'll work on orson, and we'll discuss this together."
571,Bree,good. i'm looking forward to it. are you looking forward to it?
1753,Bree,"well, if you were in trouble,i could handle it."
1143,Bree,how can he have believed this?
581,Bree,it's a perversion.
616,Bree,so obviously we need to talk.
1584,Bree,the answer is no.
1787,Bree,"they're just getting to know you,and so i want them to focus on your good qualities.i just don't know how they'll react if they find out that you're a sex addict."
3363,Bree,i never said that.
3594,Bree,say anything about what?
2172,Bree,this is not possible.
3918,Bree,every week? what's her name?
3643,Bree,guess who just called the burnt lamb chop?
2043,Bree,we'll talk in the car.
681,Bree,take your time.
2006,Bree,he did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid.
689,Bree,"""well, you have to admit that's an efficient way to teach respect for boundaries. okay, how about this one. it's perfect for andrew. it's a ranch in montana. it has lots of fresh air and plenty of open spaces and daily classes in anger management."" "
998,Bree,probably.
2526,Bree,"no, it's true. the only thing about me that's special is what i can do in the kitchen. you're right. i have got to get that recipe--by any means necessary."
3479,Bree,"$2,000?!"
3254,Bree,now?
1906,Bree,excuse me.do you have the time?
1195,Bree,really? you mean that? you wouldn't mind?
3572,Bree,"oh, we feel the same way about you. you've been lovely."
3203,Bree,"danielle, we agreed i would raise him. we agreed it would be best!"
1393,Bree,"not exactly, anyway."
2823,Bree,last week. i was afraid that mike might go to orson for pills.
3601,Bree,"by ""adult,"" you mean complex and sophisticated?"
789,Bree,"please, he can counsel you. it can help."
3499,Bree,is that what i saw on the tape-- a relationship?
287,Bree,"it's in new york, for god's sakes, why on earth would you suggest that?"
2744,Bree,please feel free to show her this letter and assure her of its wide distribution to hospitals and physicians across this and two neighboring states.
3518,Bree,i cannot let this happen. i have to find her.
3529,Bree,"occasionally, but never quite this--"
48,Bree,what? i-i'm sorry.
1848,Bree,"it was the oddest sensation.i was fine,and everything was fine,and then suddenly i was on the outside of my body watching a woman who looked like me becoming a raving maniac."
2569,Bree,we should help mike with the food.
3354,Bree,"um ,this is"
3521,Bree,thank you.
2588,Bree,i have to bring this dvd player to danielle.
2617,Bree,"oh, dear god."
3115,Bree,no!
2686,Bree,"oh, we've been invited to bob and lee 's for halloween."
3716,Bree,"thanks, but i know exactly what i'm gonna make."
3547,Bree,no.
3300,Bree,hi! come on in!
3311,Bree,"oh, right! of course. i would, uh, love to hear your thoughts."
2641,Bree,parenting tips from you? that's rich.
2965,Bree,"it's a lot of work, exhausting and completely worth it."
1986,Bree,please leave my house.
1987,Bree,your wife disappeared?
1385,Bree,"george didn't intend to commit suicide. he was trying to manipulate me into taking him back and he swallowed those pills hoping that i'd feel sorry for him. he just assumed that i would call an ambulance. when i got there, he was already slipping away. i tried to get him to accept responsibility for what he'd done, but he wouldn't."
1191,Bree,"oh, please. it's not gonna help. george, clearly, this is psychosomatic. we need to go home."
1221,Bree,"okay, i'm starting to get the feeling that we are not going to a yard sale."
3965,Bree,katherine. hi. what are you doing here?
2648,Bree,why would you say that?
703,Bree,you have to hand it to gabby and carlos. they do grieve better than anyone.
1188,Bree,"george, i can't."
216,Bree,"zach, why did you do this?"
332,Bree,"there's lynette's car, she's gotta be close."
2002,Bree,"well, no one who knows you could seriously believe that you could hurt a woman. strangers may talk, but i know the truth."
1430,Bree,"well,once he stopped suspecting me of murdering rex he was delightful,but,um--i don't really know him."
348,Bree,it's just a fact. i'm his mother. he lived inside of me.
960,Bree,"phyllis, is there something you'd like to say?"
3440,Bree,"katherine, hi! is everything all right over there?"
2346,Bree,i told you that in confidence.
2485,Bree,that was danielle.now she wants us to send a dvd player for her room.
1192,Bree,"i know, and you have every right to be mad, but, george, i am really starting to itch."
508,Bree,#name?
3112,Bree,what does that mean?
1819,Bree,"isn't it darling?i made it for your party.it's a big ""1""and a big ""7""--for ""17."""
1111,Bree,"what he said to you was horribly rude. that camp, it's extreme and unless i felt like andrew was getting really out of control, then-"
1002,Bree,do i?
1207,Bree,"oh, okay. have you been sitting there all this time?"
3659,Bree,"he only thinks he got a good deal because the salesman threw in one of those ""kiss the cook"" hats."
3613,Bree,just take it back.
1039,Bree,"at the risk of ruining a lovely evening, i have some unpleasant news. the police dug up your father today."
640,Bree,still? did you talk to him about that?
3126,Bree,i'm his wife.
3082,Bree,"there's something i've been--keeping from all of you, and, um--we need to talk."
831,Bree,who says he has to know how i spend my free time?
3608,Bree,and you're okay with this?
1150,Bree,"well, he did something to upset me and i want him gone!"
2554,Bree,"it does sound fun, but i don't think my doctor's taking on any new patients."
776,Bree,"well, that's just too bad because this needs to be discussed."
3010,Bree,no. never.
2082,Bree,"i'm not telling who it is. i'm just asking the question. if you know a husband has been unfaithful, do you tell the wife?"
1405,Bree,you didn't know?
4015,Bree,what are you doing up so late?
31,Bree,we all do.
2956,Bree,"just-- wanted to tell you that i'm out of the running for the ladies' auxiliary. i told reverend sykes to, uh, give it to edna fletcher. she was in the peace corps, you know."
542,Bree,that i don't know. what do you think i should do?
3558,Bree,what?
484,Bree,"i mean, what are the odds? first mary alice and then mrs. huber? i mean, it's shocking."
243,Bree,the man at the desk said there were no vacant rooms. mind if i bunk with you?
1930,Bree,"danielle!i'm serious, go."
1491,Bree,"now that you mention it,i guess i do.i have to go. i have some,um, muffins in the oven."
3684,Bree,"andrew, please. you were there. alex started the whole thing. you need to tell him to stop criticizing me."
252,Bree,because i think it is better to fix what you already have.
647,Bree,"yes, yes, they were. i fold."
1516,Bree,don't brush your hair at the table.
1677,Bree,"i know it's really late notice,but a friend of mine,uh,got engagedand she's throwing a party,and i thought,um,maybe you'd like to come."
3891,Bree,andrew.
291,Bree,"that's a smart idea, because you're probably going to have to sleep in it for a while."
1835,Bree,who touched this?
2073,Bree,"oh, good. i mean, i'd hate to think he had no work ethic at all."
1349,Bree,what?
3084,Bree,thank you.
2451,Bree,"so we're in zurich, and i was sick after breakfast for the third morning in a row. and i thought to myself, dear god, i hope i have not developed an allergy to chocolate brioche. life just wouldn't be worth living."
2146,Bree,he dumped you?
2584,Bree,"oh, my god."
2362,Bree,so what are you waiting for?
4048,Bree,"and i'm thinking i may have acted rashly. i mean, every marriage has its rough patches. orson loves me, and deep down, he's a good man. if i stick with this, maybe we can make it work. are you even listening to me?"
2907,Bree,"susan! look, i don't mean to pry, but given what i know about you and adam, i'm surprised he was the one to do the leaving."
666,Bree,"oh, no. i refuse to give them this kind of satisfaction. open your menu."
3079,Bree,what does that mean?
3614,Bree,"oh, my goodness. are you two--"
3697,Bree,i'd be happy to. any special requests?
1152,Bree,"my husband, the man i spent my life with for eighteen years, died thinking that i murdered him!"
1514,Bree,who told you that?
3736,Bree,what?
80,Bree,"because when you drink, you get chatty. no one needs to know that we're seeing dr. goldfine."
773,Bree,"andrew, you remember reverend sykes, don't you?"
613,Bree,you may be able to abdicate all your parental responsibility but i cannot.
1977,Bree,sort of.
2850,Bree,sylvia! open the damn door!
4030,Bree,"i, uh, took some of my silver off the mantle, and it threw off the balance."
783,Bree,your father is into s&m.
897,Bree,"well, thank you for telling me, but i think, um, i've got to go."
3723,Bree,so how do you like my new car?
2107,Bree,"no, no, no, no. i'd like you to take me to his room and unlock it so i can walk in unannounced."
3905,Bree,"well, i'm all for saying a few nice things--but you were never really friends. you and edie clashed right from the start."
4076,Bree,"i don't need any help. and besides, my parisian salad doesn't call for any chives."
3662,Bree,do--do what?
45,Bree,"and so, there's just the four of us. my oldest son andrew is 16, danielle is 15, and?"
3616,Bree,"oh, alex mentioned that you were laid off from your job. i'm so sorry."
2876,Bree,"oh, thank you so much for letting us take over your dining room."
3151,Bree,ugh. what more can you do to me?
3193,Bree,"ah! oh, god. are you all right?"
1879,Bree,"honestly, i was hoping that you'd medicate the hell out of me."
2531,Bree,"well, that, um, hardly seems neighborly. after all, i just gave you the recipe for my mincemeat pie."
3808,Bree,no.
802,Bree,"do you know, i've finally convinced rex to buy his first orchid."
3826,Bree,"oh, that's them. wait till you meet tom. you'll be so glad you had that tape recorder. he's just bursting with ideas."
2441,Bree,yes.
3929,Bree,i do.
3952,Bree,"honey, i don't mean to be negative. it's just--what's gonna happen? will you keep stealing and lying to me? i love you, but i just can't put up with that anymore."
3389,Bree,"i can't help myself, all right? my husband's gone. my son's gone. i have nothing left."
2093,Bree,"yes, absolutely."
2948,Bree,"and i am-- up for the head of the ladies' auxiliary, and reverend sykes was so impressed that i brought a new family into church, so--if you don't come back, then--"
2266,Bree,andrew brought her wine.
4120,Bree,what is he wearing?
2724,Bree,"are you sure? sweetheart, do you feel like you're making a mistake?"
918,Bree,"you know what? i am so happy that you guys came here, i really am, but i am trying really hard to be strong, so if you keep comforting me--"
2347,Bree,"right, just like you knew she was dead."
3287,Bree,let's get you to the powder room.
650,Bree,"i heard that there is a, um, little black book with the names of your clients in it."
264,Bree,"more wine? so, uh, reba, emma and lori-- why don't you girls come to the kitchen and help me with the snacks?"
3752,Bree,but that's commercial parmesan.
1197,Bree,okay.
3323,Bree,honey--i'm not angry. i'm hurt that you didn't feel like you could tell me.
2834,Bree,it was just an observation.
2643,Bree,"oh, he was happy to let you think that, but he was the one who dreaded your visits."
3046,Bree,"hi, edie, thanks again for helping me out last night."
541,Bree,"and even now, you know, after the betrayal, i, i know that we're supposed to be together. but i don't know how i can be with someone i don't trust."
3004,Bree,so--i don't really know how to be friends with you.
304,Bree,don't you think that's a little bit extreme?
3597,Bree,"well, if you'll excuse me, i am going to go get a pie that you are going to love. and you two are going to help me."
766,Bree,i may be freaked out. but that doesn't change how i feel about him.
431,Bree,"do me a favor, rex. please don't mistake my anal retentiveness for actual affection."
10,Bree,"danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree."
2203,Bree,this is so sudden.
1394,Bree,"yeah, but to be fair to lynette, you are an ex-model.and surely it must have dawned on you that some women might prefer it if you didn't kiss their husbands."
1257,Bree,"horse manure. i have it delivered. susan makes fun of me, but the proof is in the pudding."
2920,Bree,"lynette, please, we don't do that here."
2601,Bree,it really is.
756,Bree,"one of us should go talk to him, see how he is."
633,Bree,"oh, i see."
3451,Bree,"well, what could be more sisterly than that? i know i'm not the most--demonstrative--person, but i care about you deeply, and if you were to just walk out of my life, i would be very--very unhappy."
3270,Bree,this isn't about dinner. this is about her nutty liberal politics getting in the way of our grandson's nutrition.
777,Bree,"reverend, i don't mean to criticise. but it sounds like you're giving up."
3681,Bree,orson burnt the steaks.
1350,Bree,"hey. what were you thinking, taking the pills?"
2365,Bree,everybody has questions. susan and i aren't even speaking because of it.
801,Bree,"good, then it's a date."
1295,Bree,yes.
2631,Bree,you hated your mother.
536,Bree,rex. time to take your medicine.
1888,Bree,"um, but we could come back later."
949,Bree,"mrs. applewhite, hi. i am bree van de kamp, and this is my daughter danielle."
131,Bree,it's nine thirty at night. what is your brother thinking?
1309,Bree,"no, no, i'm just tired, that's all."
485,Bree,i'm gonna miss her.
2462,Bree,that would be lovely.
1182,Bree,i think so.
1767,Bree,peter--
1017,Bree,so have you given any thought to when you might be ending your visit? what?
1942,Bree,"ah.this is a little sudden, isn't it?"
806,Bree,he does not seem desperate to me.
274,Bree,"well, he better be good, because when i'm finished with you, you won't have a cent to your name!"
1992,Bree,so what do you think?
992,Bree,thank you.
256,Bree,"how many years have we been making love, and you've started to ask me something, but then you stop?"
1732,Bree,yes?
2750,Bree,i can tell you someone whose sexual pleasure is going to be reduced big-time!
3796,Bree,"that's why you wanted to know the names of my pets? orson hodge, you are shameful."
33,Bree,"oh my god, she got it the day she died."
143,Bree,"i'm curious, andrew, as you fantasise about this woman, do you ever stop and think how she came to be on this runway?"
3531,Bree,"well, if it's so simple, what are we waiting for?"
3925,Bree,so you're not--trying to start up something?
1785,Bree,"peter,i don't think i'm being unreasonable here."
1997,Bree,and what mistake would that be?
497,Bree,"oh, yeah. you always remember your first time. god, i hope i brought enough bullets."
2426,Bree,"no, no. come in."
1918,Bree,"things were falling apart at home, and i just--i just needed a place to rest, that's all."
795,Bree,the doctor upped his dosage twice and it's still not helping.
1885,Bree,and how are you going to do that?
1710,Bree,yes.i'd be curious to know just what it is you see in him.
774,Bree,"reverend, why don't you have a seat and i will get some refreshments."
2953,Bree,it just did.
1548,Bree,"for god sakes,it was an honest mistake.i thought i could have just a little bit of wine with dinner,but, apparently,my body couldn't handle it.fine!if it makes everybody happy,i will just suffer through my sneezing fits and my hives on my own."
2665,Bree,"you know, phyllis, we cannot thank you enough for accepting our apology."
2872,Bree,"well, we'll just have to find him someone who's not good at gay math."
462,Bree,"andrew, your father and i are separated and you know it."
1042,Bree,"yes, we had issues, but i would never have hurt him."
2313,Bree,that's our gift to them.
4049,Bree,"oh, really?"
2188,Bree,"i used to think that, too. then i met you. good day."
4070,Bree,"my lawyer says you're entitled to half of everything we've acquired during the marriage, so i was trying to hide some of those things, since--let's face it-- i paid for them."
1837,Bree,was it you? or you?!who was it?
2220,Bree,and--
1735,Bree,oh.
2616,Bree,"orson, just five more minutes! that's all you're getting! i tell you what. why don't we just skip the shower, and after the baby's born, i'll have a christening party? what do you say?"
2040,Bree,he didn't run away.i kicked him out.
1048,Bree,yes.
2187,Bree,"sorry, no. turns out he has an explanation for the police report."
564,Bree,"i realize that. this thing that he's hiding, is it bad?"
966,Bree,she went out of her way to be cruel to me. i don't want her at the funeral.
2527,Bree,i hope this isn't a bad time. i just wanted to bring you a housewarming gift. it's the recipe for my special mincemeat pie. it wouldn't be thanksgiving at my house without it.
3745,Bree,"well, don't thank me. it was your idea."
454,Bree,"thank you, george. that was a lovely evening."
1577,Bree,"oh,i wasn't hiding anything.i was simply--enjoying the day.what you want?"
3478,Bree,"we need to, um, get that tape back."
3497,Bree,meaning susan is your oldest friend on this street.
3930,Bree,so--how are you doing?
2649,Bree,"hi. uh, we were just talking about your sculpture."
3232,Bree,what?
1420,Bree,"here's a check for $100.that's enough for a retainer, right?"
1336,Bree,"i do know that, but i'm just not sure you're a good one, either."
2918,Bree,what are you doing?
1681,Bree,"hi. um,i need some advice from a professional.i'd like to get stinking drunk.do you have anything that can accomplish that in a hurry?"
1846,Bree,"oh, that's okay.i can't sleep anyway."
260,Bree,"rex, whatever you want, i'll go there with you. i will go there with you, you just have to say it out loud. tell me, what do you want? what do you need?"
2916,Bree,"oh, don't go catholic. all that standing and kneeling and genuflecting--i go for worship, not a workout."
611,Bree,"you've been spending a lot of time together lately, haven't you?"
229,Bree,"just one. how much longer is your midlife crisis going to last, because it is really starting to tick me off!"
1319,Bree,let me take your coat.
1352,Bree,why are you telling me this?
3080,Bree,edie--please.
2901,Bree,why? i-i thought you'd want your house back.
3483,Bree,ha. you got the tape!
1273,Bree,"come on. when i finish up here, i will come over with my sewing kit and cut you out of that."
3469,Bree,no. get me an oven mitt.
2328,Bree,would you join orson and me for dinner tomorrow night?
2308,Bree,so why couldn't you tell me this?
1153,Bree,"yes, the cardiologist shared this moronic theory with rex and rex believed him!"
2849,Bree,"no, no, no, she's barricaded herself in there."
2280,Bree,i don't think that's any of your concern.
1370,Bree,"well, it turns out he wasn't so sweet after all. anyway, uh, there's a chance that some of this may wind up in the paper, so i wanted you to hear it from me first."
2714,Bree,you're a dentist! what if there are complications?
3934,Bree,i never told you about that because--i was embarrassed.
1864,Bree,"well, now that we've finished with all this unpleasantness, i want to assure you that we are going to be good neighbors, and i hope in time, great friends."
146,Bree,"and-now she treats herself the way that other mean treat her. like an object, a piece of meat."
311,Bree,"we still have so much to teach them. for starters, we need to get across to andrew the enormity of what he's done."
1619,Bree,"you didn't know them during the good times.i mean,there was such a spark between them,so much passion."
2707,Bree,"okay, you made your point.now go home."
2181,Bree,"no, it's the police report from the night you beat your first wife. i'm still working on the menu."
1004,Bree,"um, yeah. sure. hold on a second."
1730,Bree,i think you'd love the opera.the music and the voices--it's just all so-- passionate.
3228,Bree,"but in regards to my husband, i should make one thing very clear--his passing had nothing to do with my cooking."
382,Bree,hello.
3525,Bree,"hello, dr. cominis. how's my husband doing?"
2443,Bree,i'm so sorry to be putting you through this. i-i wouldn't blame you if you ran like hell and never looked back.
2286,Bree,i asked orson to move out last night.
3476,Bree,i didn't see you do that.
2447,Bree,"well, um, while we were in switzerland, she ran across this boarding school, and she fell in love with it and just insisted that we let her spend a year abroad."
1801,Bree,"every child deserves to be loved unconditionally,and i thought that was the kind of love that i had for you.maybe if i had,it would've been different."
3850,Bree,"yes, i, uh-- remember that."
3958,Bree,i did not raise you to be bitchy.
818,Bree,why didn't you tell me?
1307,Bree,"that's true, in the beginning."
3343,Bree,"oh, lynette, i appreciate everything you've done. but i've actually approved the old campaign, and i can't just tell them i've changed my mind."
4125,Bree,"uh, she needs me to get something for her. i will be right back."
3432,Bree,is that bad?
2720,Bree,how are you feeling?
129,Bree,you know it's leaking.
230,Bree,"so how is it going with mike, susan?"
2975,Bree,it's interesting. i can't really picture that though.
1967,Bree,did you lose something?
2737,Bree,"so, susan , you mentioned something about bringing dessert. what is it?"
2937,Bree,"you don't say that. i've--i've never heard you say that, not once."
3174,Bree,oh. sorry. paid for what?
704,Bree,"i don't know. i mean, maybe it's part of the ritual."
3774,Bree,thank you for having us over. we are so honored to be the first guests in your new home.
727,Bree,"oh lynette, i'm so swamped today. my house is a mess and i've got millions of errands to run."
1501,Bree,what are you talking about?
510,Bree,i was just caught off guard.
601,Bree,tell him that we found his condom and that he is forbidden from - y'know.
718,Bree,"rex, i'm not going and that's all there is to it."
2666,Bree,"oh, darn, i forgot the napkins."
464,Bree,"no, we are not going to have sex!"
1340,Bree,"good, good. seeing friends. i just started co-chairing a charity event for the junior league and um, and i broke up with george."
3898,Bree,"orson, think about how i built this company from nothing, how it brings me joy and pride and a sense of accomplishment. is that really something you want me to give up?"
2826,Bree,"hi there. i- i don't mean to intrude, but are you all right?"
394,Bree,"uh, the situation is, um, fluid. i'm not certain what his plans are yet."
2283,Bree,and yet you're cooking?
299,Bree,our son could spent the rest of his life in jail. i won't allow that.
2417,Bree,aah!
670,Bree,"so, what are you having? the veal looks good."
1798,Bree,did you forget that we're supposed to take that tour of perkins college today?
2770,Bree,"no, he'll be sleeping with us."
2192,Bree,"coffee's almost ready, and if you'd prefer to watch the coverage on channel 9, it's on in the den. orson, greta needs a coaster."
1899,Bree,"good, add that on."
1213,Bree,mmm.
3834,Bree,would anyone care for something sweet?
1487,Bree,"hi, betty."
732,Bree,"well, art is subjective."
2430,Bree,so we're back to being friends?
3047,Bree,"orson's car is still parked at my house. um, did he mention when he'd be coming back to pick it up?"
1227,Bree,huh?
2051,Bree,"andrew, please!"
2844,Bree,that she had an affair with adam.
3769,Bree,"lynette, i-i-i don't understand why you're so upset."
1870,Bree,what are you doing here?
2317,Bree,"well, you should've told someone. people thought you were dead. some even thought that orson killed you."
2086,Bree,"gaby, are you and carlos getting back together?"
1447,Bree,i had two glasses of wine.
1861,Bree,this is my husband rex.
2011,Bree,"excuse me, could you give us just a second?"
263,Bree,what happened?
2165,Bree,"oh! do you two know each other? well, that saves me an introduction.uh, tish, you know, i was wondering if you need any help with the christmas gala. last year, i was on the decorating committee--"
2606,Bree,"i knew it! phyllis--rex's mother. ever since he died, she's been trying to buy children's affection."
3732,Bree,why not? what's the point of success if you can't share it with the people you love?
2262,Bree,"gloria, i've been thinking and--"
3541,Bree,"oh, orson, i can't help but take issue with your sarcastic tone."
799,Bree,"rex, are you still jealous?"
1054,Bree,what?
1810,Bree,i don't want to talk about it.
3758,Bree,now? people are waiting.
2023,Bree,it's hodge now.
809,Bree,"well, i certainly don't want to hurt him,again."
1789,Bree,"honey,what are you wearing?"
2809,Bree,"andrew, i understand you're angry with me about what i said, but--i do have a good reason for wanting to raise benjamin differently. i mean, let's be honest. you put me through hell."
1337,Bree,all ready?
150,Bree,"if you think i'm going to apologise for taking you out of a strip club, you're wrong! i consider it one of my finest moments."
2133,Bree,of course not. i already went through thinking i'd lost andrew. i can't go through that again.
2675,Bree,"oh, please, phyllis. even you have to agree that a girl who'd trade her baby for a convertible isn't ready for motherhood."
1168,Bree,i don't know. i'm just really starting to itch.
933,Bree,oh?
3281,Bree,"i've been asking myself that all day. maybe she's afraid if you get big, you'll leave home and go play for the red sox."
3179,Bree,good.
2865,Bree,what?
3679,Bree,"well, why not? it was a fairly grand gesture on my part."
2401,Bree,"oh, dear. i'm not sure how to tell you this, but--after alma knocked you out, she assaulted you."
1576,Bree,hmm?
1344,Bree,did you say a blue bike?
3197,Bree,i can see that.
913,Bree,i never leave the house with an unmade bed. you know that.
2677,Bree,"i know you're lonely, phyllis, but i can't give up this child just to make you feel better."
607,Bree,so should i just dial nine one one?
2774,Bree,"darling, sex is the last thing women want right after they've given birth."
3908,Bree,wow. it sounds like she gave you just what you needed. good for edie.
892,Bree,well?
2537,Bree,"i was doing a little baking, and i was wondering if i could borrow something."
3795,Bree,who told you that?
2259,Bree,"it's just not right. your mother skipped lunch, too."
318,Bree,"well, when did you decide this?"
4042,Bree,what is that?
3336,Bree,"orson, you really don't wanna work with me. i mean, you only see me at home. but at work, when the pressure's on, i can be a bit of a handful. katherine's seen how i get."
2482,Bree,are you gonna back off now?
1481,Bree,"oh, honey,why would i want that?"
644,Bree,"no, i can't."
3857,Bree,"you will do no such thing. from this moment on, you are forbidden from entering any of our friends' homes."
829,Bree,"well, that's not his choice to make."
2777,Bree,"oh, hello, dear. andrew, get orson's plate from the oven."
2335,Bree,"oh, you didn't have to do that."
1040,Bree,"well, apparently, they want to do an autopsy. they don't think that he had a heart attack. they think that somebody was poisoning him."
1799,Bree,consider me a cheerleader for anything that expedites me getting you out from under my roof.
4052,Bree,in the ballpark.
3842,Bree,we will talk about this later.
1194,Bree,"please. i mean, clearly, you didn't come here to shop."
1990,Bree,"orson, my hand."
4129,Bree,"oh, my--"
3741,Bree,"oh, that sounds lovely."
219,Bree,"i must say, i'm jealous of how much time you two spend together. my mother-in-law would never want to hang out with me all day."
1824,Bree,"honey, i can't possibly put it in the garbage as is."
2459,Bree,"look, if you're gonna start complaining, i'm going to hang up."
3358,Bree,"oh, honey. everybody's asking about you. i want you to be here. it's my big day."
221,Bree,have fun.
1458,Bree,"look,i'm--$5,000."
2511,Bree,"do not move. we want to pamper you, so please let us."
2538,Bree,i just let myself into katherine's house to get that recipe.
456,Bree,"me, too."
4090,Bree,i told him i don't love him. he said he doesn't care. he wants us to work on our marriage.
1558,Bree,i have something to tell them.
2323,Bree,why don't i wrap up a piece of this pound cake for you to enjoy later?
2518,Bree,i'm not. that despicable woman was just supposed to bring a simple green salad. she not only brought a pie--she hid mine and served hers.
3917,Bree,another visitor? who?
784,Bree,he makes me beat him with a riding crop and i let him. it's no wonder you're perverted. look at who your parents are.
2314,Bree,i just can't believe that orson could do such a thing.
553,Bree,"well, it must've been some sort of accident. i mean little boys don't just kill their baby sisters."
754,Bree,no.
1539,Bree,your crime?
3173,Bree,"katherine, hi. what are you doing here?"
2516,Bree,"well, clearly no tips are needed. as my friends said, ""best pie ever made."""
1121,Bree,andrew! andrew!
3883,Bree,"so you decided to punish me by resorting to petty theft? for god sakes, orson, i'm your wife."
1077,Bree,"you know, we've been eating out a lot lately. why don't you come over friday for a home-cooked meal. wouldn't that be nice?"
2037,Bree,"some reporter.all she could tell me is what neighborhood they found him in.they don't have any contact information, no phone number, no address."
3910,Bree,"you know, edie used to live around here when she moved away from wisteria lane."
2782,Bree,"i was going to say angry, and perhaps that anger began when we exiled you to the nursery. i'm just trying to learn from my mistakes."
1231,Bree,#name?
527,Bree,i'm not speaking to you.
2397,Bree,"andrew, i need you to come over here right away--and, um--bring the wheelbarrow."
3218,Bree,it's not personal. you know how carlos just started at the club?
925,Bree,"because it makes me think of my aunt fern. on the day we got married, i told her how happy i was, and she told me that even during bad times to always remember that the best was yet to come. and so as i polish it, i think about you and the kids and our life and how right she was."
728,Bree,if it were any other day.
3720,Bree,i don't think i do that.
2832,Bree,"well, you're only human."
860,Bree,it doesn't matter. you decide.
2055,Bree,"andrew. andrew! andrew, please! andrew!"
750,Bree,"that is what makes a good mother. someone who knows their child inside and out, so that if they get into trouble they'll know what to do. i don't know him well enough."
4083,Bree,what?!
2564,Bree,"yes, and it is going to stay that way because i have instructed sister theresa to keep you sequestered in your room until the baby is born."
2036,Bree,fine!
2229,Bree,"orson, why does she have to have an ulterior motive?"
520,Bree,"why can't we talk this over? george, i -"
3183,Bree,you read it ready?
407,Bree,"needs. like, sexual needs?"
2264,Bree,andrew!
1281,Bree,how did this get in the paper?
3913,Bree,"you don't happen to have a private room, do you?"
2553,Bree,"you know, my o.b. is all the way across town. you just do not want to drive that far."
1321,Bree,"no. george, i don't want to."
3024,Bree,and--it worked beautifully. i'm in.
20,Bree,"i know that you think i'm angry about coming here, but i'm not. i mean, the kids wanted a change of pace, something fun. i get it. probably will want something healthier tomorrow night though, i'm thinking about chicken?"
3605,Bree,a video store i will never return to. are you aware that one of the stars of this film is--
3939,Bree,"a couple of days ago. we've been trying to get in touch with your dad, but he's still out of the country."
3618,Bree,thank you again for making the long drive down from oakdale. it's high time our families got together.
2016,Bree,okay.
2291,Bree,"orson, it's me again. please call. we need to talk."""
1655,Bree,"uh,sure. help yourself.there's also frosted glasses in the freezer."
2167,Bree,nice to be seen.
2404,Bree,"no, dear, you were dead to the waist."
470,Bree,"that's sweet, but i'm taking care of him because it's the right thing to do."
507,Bree," okay, now all you have to do is take a deep breath--"
1472,Bree,"andrew,give me one good reason why shouldn't call the police."
1023,Bree,insurance investigator?
2114,Bree,remind me to buy paper plates. we'll need them till a certain someone can be trusted with china again.
1391,Bree,i did.betty never rsvp'd.
643,Bree,no.
612,Bree,"oh, uh, andrew, i'm gonna want you home by eleven on saturday."
798,Bree,what thing? we don't have a thing.
1338,Bree,you know this gainful employment thing is really starting to cut into our social life.
1075,Bree,of course. you remember mr. williams.
1081,Bree,andrew!
2995,Bree,"why not? i'm perfectly capable of presenting. i've done it for the last eight years. i mean, no one wants to accept an award from a woman who looks like she should be in line at the needle exchange."
3559,Bree,"enough coffee. it's not working, anyway. it must be decaf."
1682,Bree,i don't need donna.i need you.
4059,Bree,"give me that. i'm so glad this divorce is almost over. an obnoxious, unpleasant man will be out of my life, and so will orson."
2460,Bree,"well, perhaps if some of those rules had been in place when you took up with edie's nephew, you might not be in this little pickle."
2234,Bree,"well, i didn't mean it literally, but okay. we'll, um, we'll sit together. and we'll talk."
691,Bree,"it's easy for you, isn't it? you're not the one he's openly rude to. you're not the one he challenges every day. you're not the one he hates."
1877,Bree,why would you assume that?
2793,Bree,"oh, he just adores it. the three of us are such a happy little family. aren't we?"
139,Bree,i hope it wasn't anything i said.
1418,Bree,you would actually let the police arrest your own mother?
3073,Bree,"i've already hired one. you'll be hearing from him shortly. oh, and if you're in the mood for a carnival, why not call edie? i hear you get three throws for a dollar with her, too."
2633,Bree,where is she going?
1082,Bree,george.
3640,Bree,"actually, you're right on time. we're just about to eat. shall we?"
1740,Bree,"yeah! you know, they're always coming up with these excuses to justify being a home-wrecker."
767,Bree,i can be just as cool as you can.
1290,Bree,"maybe, but why risk it?"
359,Bree,really?
3050,Bree,"oh, i-i-i think you know."
2933,Bree,benjamin doesn't love matisse. he loves purple. oh. please stop trying to turn our son into an intellectual.
1459,Bree,"well,how am i supposed to get home? i don't have any money."
2820,Bree,here. i brought you a few things in case there is a tornado.
1629,Bree,so? you had one of the loveliest childhoods i've ever known.
329,Bree,yeah.
1166,Bree,i don't know. i felt something weird.
1827,Bree,she said she doesn't want balloons.i'm fine.
181,Bree,oh.
1368,Bree,"oh, hold it. what are you gonna do with that?"
272,Bree,"mrs. stark, you handle this however you see fit."
1025,Bree,suspicious?
816,Bree,he said you're still in love with me.
1283,Bree,rex has only been dead for seven weeks.
1156,Bree,right this way.
2274,Bree,monique polier?
2879,Bree,"yes, and a nice home-cooked meal. trust me, there are absolutely no tricks up our sleeve."
324,Bree,"actually, i was thinking we could arrange for you to talk to a professional."
1438,Bree,"although,i have to confess,i do have an ulterior motive.i need to ask you a favor."
3779,Bree,he's exaggerating. they're children. it just looks like a lot of money to them.
1031,Bree,she's my mother-in-law. of course she said horrible things about me.
4080,Bree,"well, if you're referring to the financial settlement, i already told you, i don't care anymore."
2951,Bree,lynette--
3437,Bree,what?!
2153,Bree,that sounds lovely.
1489,Bree,"well, my fear is that if we keep them apart,they'll try that much harder to be together.i mean, you know how teenagers can be,and, well, a lot can happen in a couple of weeks."
856,Bree,"no, not at all. i think that we should talk about it. in fact i think maybe we don't talk enough."
4072,Bree,"well, that part's non-negotiable."
3408,Bree,"orson! you are amazing! one week on the job, and he's already bringing in huge accounts."
1061,Bree,"sort of. well, i think the police now have a different theory, which is if i wasn't poisoning rex on my own, then maybe you were helping me."
1869,Bree,"yes. uh, excruciatingly so."
3052,Bree,edie!
2418,Bree,"andrew, you're here. what happened to me?"
47,Bree,"um, doc,um?"
3496,Bree,"katherine, i'm sorry, but i just have to ask--are you sure you know what you're doing?"
138,Bree,"you think that's bad? tomorrow morning i'm cleaning it! oh, by the way keith, i didn't get the chance to tell you, that was a lovely solo last week in church."
3573,Bree,leaving the man a thank-you card.
594,Bree,i do. would you mind if i ran these through the dishwasher once?
669,Bree,"i will scream about your cruelty. then i will scream about your infidelity. and then, just to make sure it really hurts, i will scream about your distasteful sexual habits. you want to know what true humiliation is, you just take one step."
2243,Bree,because your doctor says people taking your medication shouldn't drink. a warning you've chosen to ignore if the--lipstick on the vodka bottle is any indication.
1199,Bree,"so i was talking to one of the bellmen, and he said there's a place not far from here where we could go horseback riding. doesn't that sound like fun? george?"
2866,Bree,"walter, i can't find a contractor now. everybody is booked for the next year."
1508,Bree,i have the same recipe for english plum pudding.it takes six hours to prepare.how would she have time to make all of this and everything else that we ate today?this is not the pudding of an honest woman.
1868,Bree,oh. i'm so sorry.i didn't recognize you.
1982,Bree,"hi, can i help you?"
1521,Bree,"when i was young, my stepmother told me that i was very lucky.i possessed beauty,wit, cunning and insight.these were weapons all women needed to survive in the world."
1744,Bree,"well,i am sorry,but the peter i know has a little more sense--"
1656,Bree,"i know that you're still angry with me,and,i wanted to tell you that i have,joined a recovery program.a.a.i just wanted you to know that--and to tell you i'm sorry.you are--a real friend,and i value your honesty."
1968,Bree,oh!um.i don't do that.
3153,Bree,"well, i suppose i should say thank you."
1729,Bree,"oh,i,um,had a chance to have a nice chat with justin the other day.he really seems very sweet.i've invited him over for dinner tonight. i hope you don't mind."
1079,Bree,"actually, it is getting late, and i am tired, so--"
2341,Bree,detective ridley. can i help you?
2637,Bree,"well, um--technically, yes."
991,Bree,"people want to know how i'm doing, but the minute they ask, you, you jump into the spotlight, and they forget all about me. i need consoling, too, phyllis. have you ever thought of that?"
1360,Bree,"'oh,um--well,um,it was very good of you to tell me in person,truly.''"
685,Bree,they're brochures for youth detention centers.
2325,Bree,"actually,there is. i'd love it if you could join us for dinner this weekend. there are some friends that i'm just dying for you to meet."
984,Bree,"phyllis, there are people waiting, so--"
1090,Bree,"you know, i haven't even thought about it."
2900,Bree,leave us.
2924,Bree,"wow, you bought a bible."
2315,Bree,"oh, thank god!"
3285,Bree,"yes. yes, it is."
2038,Bree,you know you could show a little compassion.your brother is out there on the streets struggling to survive!
1704,Bree,no.i resented you because those were kick-ass peanut butter cookies.
3191,Bree,"this is my kitchen, and this is my staff--the most gifted, hardworking team a cook could ever have hoped for. i cannot say enough good things about them."
2242,Bree,"mother hodge, your food will get cold!"
3717,Bree,that was a lovely service.
3244,Bree,i would be happy to. i just want to make sure it's the kind you like.
95,Bree,"hey, where've you been?"
3815,Bree,isn't it noon?
1425,Bree,how'd it go?
872,Bree,"i don't know. um, um, think of something unpleasant."
3443,Bree,"oh, i just really wish you'd taken things more slowly."
3771,Bree,what's that?
604,Bree,"well, we can't put it back in his room. i mean that would be like we're condoning him having pre-marital sex."
3374,Bree,"orson, please. you're putting me in an impossible position."
3734,Bree,"come on, lynette. you can't tell me this money won't take the pressure off."
1423,Bree,"if you wanna lie to the police,go right ahead.but please know that i will sue you."
1741,Bree,"no, i'm not."
2908,Bree,"i understand, but whatever you do, don't keep your feelings bottled up. you've got to let'em out."
2109,Bree,"oh, gus, i don't plan anything unpleasant. i'm simply going to inform mr. faladi what repercussions he faces if he continues this relationship and trust him to see reason."
695,Bree,"well, think about how good men are at lying on the spot. i mean, god forbid, you should give them time and a pen!"
1317,Bree,"oh, my goodness. oh, george, this is ty grant. we used to date in college. ty, this is george, um, he's a good friend of mine."
4099,Bree,what were you thinking?
4025,Bree,go on.
2994,Bree,"katherine, no one expects you to be a martyr. why don't you go home?"
2211,Bree,"lakeview? oh, you gave me the impression that she was back east."
481,Bree,pick me up at one and we'll do something fun.
3083,Bree,yes.
1691,Bree,"um,i'm sorry,dad,but i think my relationship with andrew is just a bit more complicated than--"
1983,Bree,"yes, and you are?"
2275,Bree,"mother hodge, i have your breakfast."""
4046,Bree,like i could finally take it off and be myself.
1958,Bree,ummm.ummm.i thought we--orson?
4093,Bree,what can we think of? he's holding all the cards.
217,Bree,"zach said mary alice killed herself because of something that he had done, something bad. is there anyone else who'd know what he was talking about?"
2237,Bree,just for a few weeks till we find a place where she'll be happier. you should've heard her in the car. she's absolutely miserable in that nursing home.
2149,Bree,carolyn. this isn't a very good time. i'm baking.
208,Bree,"we will do it again. we'll have our impromptu holiday dinner, i promise. bye."
338,Bree,"oh, baby. nobody likes to admit that they can't handle the pressure."
386,Bree,meet someone. i'm raising your children.
3278,Bree,"oh! uh, a hot dog."
1981,Bree,"oh.well, i'll be darn."
1392,Bree,very--interesting.
2452,Bree,"oh, not until the early fall, but enough about me. this is your day--you and victor--who, by the way, i have not met yet."
2859,Bree,thank god.
730,Bree,"porter, honey, those cookies are hot. just wait a few minutes and i'll give you one when they're cool, okay."
410,Bree,"oh, i don't hate you, maisy. i pity you."
2183,Bree,why would she attack you?
2420,Bree,suicide? no.orson would never try to kill himself.the police are wrong.it must have been an accident.
3375,Bree,aren't you dapper?
3057,Bree,"good night. okay, back to business. how do you feel about parker house rolls? i mean, personally, i think they're played out."
3421,Bree,"what a thoughtful son you are. so, uh, have you given any thought to the venue?"
370,Bree,i never pushed you around. we always made our decisions together.
891,Bree,"oh, well, that's very nice of you."
2984,Bree,"thank you, mrs. downing. listen, when i present the founder's award tonight, i was wondering--"
4073,Bree,"there's no point. so you should get a piece of paper, start to make a list of what it is you wish to take with you."
878,Bree,"george, i do love you as a friend. i wish you could love me the same way back, but since you can't, goodbye."
435,Bree,"oh yes, he'll, he'll live. but the doctor said he's at risk for something called pericarditis. do you know anything about that?"
486,Bree,"damn, i have to take rex to his angiogram."
1450,Bree,what do you think you're doing?
164,Bree,just because you didn't hear them fighting doesn't mean they were happy.
2005,Bree,"that was close. the florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet. but not to worry, crisis averted."
1975,Bree,"well, that's the odd thing.i mean there was no pain, per se, in fact, it wasn't entirely unpleasant."
2332,Bree,"by the way, when my friends ask you what happened--and they will--i don't think it's necessary to go into all that unpleasantness about orson and monique. all they need to know is that you're back and we're on good terms."
996,Bree,"this is my third phone call, mr. flannery. and if someone doesn't call me back soon, i'm going to be irritated."
3051,Bree,"oh, come on, edie. you know, carlos, mike, karl-- you do have a way at picking at other women's leftovers."
899,Bree,you really want to know?
2915,Bree,i would love that. we're--we're leaving right now. you can follow us.
2131,Bree,"when i saw you in that tub, it was the worst moment of my life.the thought of losing you is more than i can bear."
480,Bree,i'd love to.
3906,Bree,"uh, gaby, before we learn what edie tastes like--"
2952,Bree,it did. it did help me.
2576,Bree,i can't tell you.
1637,Bree,you sound like you're impressed.
511,Bree,"i'm still married to rex. i mean, we're not even legally separated yet."
2833,Bree,"well, they seem-- content."
3821,Bree,"you know, there could be a perfectly innocent explanation."
1390,Bree,what'd you play?
156,Bree,"well, my father was a prosecutor and he always said that the simplest explanation was usually the right one."
1486,Bree,all right.
1287,Bree,the ring?
39,Bree,do you remember when you proposed?
1960,Bree,"well, i thought we agreed we wanted our wedding night to be perfect."
3777,Bree,a tiny salary bump.
3234,Bree,"orson, i have 6 hours to prepare a meal for 80 people. we're not having this discussion now."
3582,Bree,nice try. tell alex we dress for dinner.
3369,Bree,"for god sakes, lynette, stop calling me a success. there's nothing successful about me. my friends think i'm gonna drop them, my partner resents me, and my husband--has moved into the guest bedroom. everything i gain comes at some horrible price, and i'm starting to wonder if any of it's even worth it."
67,Bree,"oh rex, you look so tired."
833,Bree,i don't know. but anything that good has got to be sinful.
3797,Bree,andrew has been with me since i launched the company. he runs every aspect of the business. he deserves what he's making.
2913,Bree,"exactly, and all the while, where was edna? lounging around in zimbabwe in the peace corps. she won't let any of us forget it."
1162,Bree,that better?
2477,Bree,"the nice thing about this fake pregnancy is my feet don't swell.i mean,i'd never be able to squeeze into these sling-backs if i really was 8-12 months pregnant."
746,Bree,if you will excuse me.
378,Bree,"hello? yes, this is she-- marijuana in his locker? oh, i'm just--horrified. there must be some sort of terrible mistake. um, yeah, okay. well, i will be right down."
3981,Bree,orson's lying to me again.
3427,Bree,"oh, that's nice. hey, was there a blue convertible parked in front of katherine's?"
2856,Bree,um-- a snake. what's the difference? he doesn't have one.
271,Bree,"and so does andrew! blaming his actions on our problems--"" ""--does not help him."
4121,Bree,no.
584,Bree,fine.
4113,Bree,george!
1607,Bree,"oh! um, i couldn't possibly top that.thank you, though."
3415,Bree,"katherine, you are a vibrant, attractive woman. you--"
281,Bree,"oh, is she now! and when you were planning on telling me?"
4017,Bree,i'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done.
2207,Bree,"oh, by the way, orson, i need your mother's address at the nursing home."
4071,Bree,"yes, but i'm tired of all the lying and the sneaking around, so i will inform him you can have whatever you like."
4062,Bree,"sadly, karl, i always know what you are saying."
1342,Bree,"well, when i broke up with george, i saw something in his eyes. it was a kind of malevolence, and it just didn't seem to me to be the sort of thing you could cure."
697,Bree,"andrew, i need you to take out the trash."
3090,Bree,"oh, please. i saw you at my nail salon."
673,Bree,"well, you keep coming up with excuses to use everyone's bathroom, and then two days ago, mr. cowley looked into your back yard and saw you and carlos doing your laundry in the jacuzzi."
3991,Bree,oh. who--who's that?
1974,Bree,"and then it was like something inside ruptured.well, not so much a rupture as a spasm.waves of this hot, clutching.i think i might have had a small stroke!"
1845,Bree,yeah.
2310,Bree,"well, first you pack up your things and come home, and then we toss your mother out on her evil ass."
3315,Bree,"orson, i have amazing news. the chamber of commerce just called."
1850,Bree,"because, um, i can't sleep just yet."
3557,Bree,that's all right. i'll just drink this tea.
3995,Bree,we--we should go.
3916,Bree,"to be honest, i-i'm not feeling up to this. i'm gonna have to come back another day.female guard: fine. he's got another visitor scheduled anyway, so i don't even have to tell him you were here."
439,Bree,"oh, him. well, we're separated."
3503,Bree,"that was all local. this is ""the new york dispatch."" if this goes well, my cookbook could be on the front page of their weekend style section. katherine, what did you do to your hair? i've never seen it look so thick and lustrous."
1597,Bree,"oh,there's no pretending.i am going to my first a.a. meeting tomorrow.of course,i picked one in the worst part of town so i won't run into anybody i know,which,of course,means i will."
1672,Bree,"um,donna--i-i really appreciate everything that you've been doing for me,but i think i was really making some progress with peter as my sponsor.and i was thinking--"
3214,Bree,"oh, right. um, tomorrow for sure, then."
3988,Bree,"well, clearly, i like to think of myself as a rich person even more."
3569,Bree,"well, over time, you'll learn that there's a balance of power in relationships, and if your beloved ever pulls a nasty trick on you, like say, drugging you into a stupor, then the balance of power shifts to you, and then you can demand they prove their love by, say, undergoing surgery. do you understand?"
2689,Bree,sure! how familiar are you with pop icons from the '70s?
907,Bree,i don't believe you.
565,Bree,"oh, okay, um, maybe it's better that i don't know."
3204,Bree,"please, danielle, we can have any arrangement you like. please, just don't take him! for god sakes, orson's gone. you kids are grown. benjamin's all i have!"
261,Bree,why?
1823,Bree,oh.okay.
3743,Bree,you know what might be even better? my publisher has been begging me to do a local launch for my book.
1938,Bree,do i know you?
1696,Bree,she's dead!
3516,Bree,why were you talking to that woman?
2653,Bree,"those stupid nuns at the convent let danielle's grandmother kidnap her. she claimed i'd given her permission for a weekend visit. phyllis! it's me. you can screen your calls all you want to, but trust me, old woman, you are in a world of trouble. i know where you live, and i am coming for you."
1381,Bree,"andrew, i made an appointment with a therapist for you, me, and danielle."
3585,Bree,"gaby, you never sell a man's autographed baseball."
1878,Bree,"is that what you're doing, asking me all those ridiculous questions about my childhood, trying to get to know me? well, here's a clue. i'm not crazy.i just have a few issues."
126,Bree,if the school and the paediatrician both think that the twins could stand to be medicated-then what's the problem?
1060,Bree,"well, that's why i took the polygraph, to prove to them that i was innocent."
1316,Bree,"ty! ty grant. oh, hi! what are you doing in town?"
2506,Bree,"well, maybe she blocked it out. did something bad happen to her when she was young?"
276,Bree,go ahead sweetheart. ask whatever you want.
2857,Bree,oh. sorry.
2209,Bree,"well, all the more reason to send her one. let the nurses know that she has family at home who loves her--and who could drop by at any minute and slap them with a lawsuit."
269,Bree,is that relevant?
3571,Bree,my husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested.
2791,Bree,"again, not to pry, but--"
3972,Bree,so did she get a good look at--death?
1815,Bree,name it. it's yours.
3802,Bree,"no, i'm just saying you're worth--less."
183,Bree,"i'm serving it this year for christmas. i like to try out new recipes before the actual holiday. that way, if the cook book has gotten it wrong, i can fix it."
3426,Bree,he came while orson was out. i let him record a message on my phone.
377,Bree,good. where does andrew keep his marijuana?
2762,Bree,"oh, we had a very busy day. we dropped off the dry cleaning, we deposited money into our christmas account, and then we got circumcised."
55,Bree,take off your coat.
87,Bree,"fine. oh, and doctor. if what he's about to discuss has anything to do with adultery, prostitution or internet pornography, i would really appreciate you taking a moral hardline."
330,Bree,"andrew, you almost killed another human being."
1777,Bree,#name?
1862,Bree,and this is my son--the criminal. go on.
1817,Bree,"honey, where am i gonna put all of his things?and, you know, he might come back at some point."
418,Bree,are you having an affair with my husband?
3987,Bree,"i want you to say that for $300 an hour, you have some lawyer tricks up your sleeve to help me protect my business."
2555,Bree,"i, um--don't remember."
1784,Bree,"well,he did falsely accuse me of child abuse.i would say we're even.wouldn't you,andrew?"
2300,Bree,"well, that was incredibly awkward. i'm sorry you both had to sit through it. was it me? was i out of line?"
1014,Bree,really?
3405,Bree,you work here?
1652,Bree,what?
207,Bree,"oh,sweetie, i was just coming over to talk to you. i'm so sorry, but something really important came up and i have to cancel."
3247,Bree,you can fix this. just tell them that you're at the wrong table and then slip out the side door.
3701,Bree,"mine is so erratic. i'm not even sure what the real temperature is. of course, if a certain doctor would loosen the purse strings--"
447,Bree,"oh, my, they're exquisite. compost and eggshells?"
1535,Bree,"come on in, betty.get you a drink?"
2622,Bree,oh! so you're responsible--
187,Bree,"most of my family went to the hospital, but i stayed home because i was so young.when i looked out the window i saw all my mother's blood on the street and nobody was doing anything about it. so i got a hose and i washed it off. and once it was clean, i felt so much better."
1341,Bree,"dr. goldfine, do you ever really cure people, i mean, even though they're really crazy?"
2130,Bree,"danielle, how can you think i don't care about your feelings?"
3598,Bree,"all right, you two, what is going on?"
3901,Bree,"steal what you must, my love. but it won't be my company."
77,Bree,so how many will i be cooking for?
3895,Bree,this is happening so fast.
1358,Bree,''thank you very much.''
896,Bree,i see.
2959,Bree,"and it meant a lot that you came to me for guidance, and--i'm sorry that i wasn't there for you. i want you to have faith in me and our friendship."
2103,Bree,does she know you killed your wife?
3286,Bree,"isn't this nice? for the first time in years, my family is all here under the same roof."
3633,Bree,"you know, we actually have some very comfortable patio furniture in the backyard--along with a place to put your recyclables."
2475,Bree,excuse me?
1754,Bree,because i can be very strong for those people that i really care about.
1916,Bree,"saw right through that, did ya?"
3845,Bree,"so say something. stand up to him. but stealing? honestly, orson, why would you do something like that?"
1398,Bree,"this is not a joke,andrew.what if the neighbors had seen you?"
1099,Bree,george.
3715,Bree,"i can't believe you saved this. of course, i'm not really in the mood to write a cookbook right now."
1306,Bree,"well, then why did you date her in the first place?"
3923,Bree,"i stopped by the prison today. the guard tells me you've been visiting orson--sometimes twice a week, she said."
1816,Bree,"but, sweetheart, this is--this is his room."
474,Bree,"you are? oh, that's wonderful."
1248,Bree,"no. dr. goldfine, my therapist."
3198,Bree,sorry. oops!
1867,Bree,do i know you?
1805,Bree,you win?
638,Bree,"ida! ida greenberg,that is not your paper!"
3111,Bree,"oh. how, um, colorfully put."
3132,Bree,hey. what's going on?
1660,Bree,"i could not ask for anything more.thanks.see you around,i hope."
2534,Bree,"well, it's tradition. i always organize our little get-togethers, and i always bring dessert."
1859,Bree,"well, don't tell him that.if he doesn't feel guilty he'll never learn shame."
1377,Bree,"andrew, george williams fooled a lot of people."
40,Bree,"we sat on skyline drive and drank a bottle of apple wine. and when we finished it, you turned to me and you said, if you marry me, bree mason, i promise to love you for the rest of my life. and even though i was engaged to ty grant, and even though my father didn't like you, i said yes."
376,Bree,"hi, danielle, how was school?"
2034,Bree,"orson! my child is in trouble.don't make me choose between the two of you because believe me you will lose! now please, get your ass in gear!"
748,Bree,yours is blue. danielle loves pink. and i have no idea what my own son's favourite colour is.
2333,Bree,and orson didn't kill you.
1499,Bree,he's your son?
2600,Bree,mm.
3241,Bree,what are you doing here? you were disinvited.
1136,Bree,detective barton. what are you doing here?
758,Bree,"don't get up. i'll be quick. andrew, all any parent can do is try to provide their child with the tools to succeed in life. education, love, a good, clean safe home. well, i have given you those things and i'm through feeling guilty. so if you want to piss your life away and blame it on how horrible things are at home, then go ahead. but i want it stated for the record that i am a good mother. do you hear me? i am a good mother."
741,Bree,"well, porter was misbehaving so i had to punish him."
2457,Bree,off the hook? that doesn't even make sense.
3425,Bree,"well, that's what's so great about it. technically, it's a business dinner. it has all the potential upside of a date while still being tax-deductible."
3155,Bree,"and you were right. i did. you just think i'm being stubborn, don't you? making you jump through hoops when it's so clear we belong together."
1929,Bree,danielle--i want you to get out of the house now.he's a killer.
3143,Bree,"all right, so i will call the ice sculptor and see if we can--"
1538,Bree,"yes, i did.i also noticed that you had him chained in the basement."
3418,Bree,"oh! yes, of course. uh, i'm his wife bree. i'm afraid he's out running errands, but he's told me all about you."
4064,Bree,"ooh. lynette, that's bad."
2018,Bree,"you're upset, aren't you? you're still thinking about what i said at the church."
1032,Bree,she blamed me for every problem that rex and i ever had.
3308,Bree,"thank you, katherine. i will never become stuck-up and full of myself."
1783,Bree,"your brother and i had a talk,and we've come to a detente of sorts."
3807,Bree,"well, take it back now. they're liquidating, and they're gonna need every penny they can get."
255,Bree,"""see, but i don't think that's the reason. after i left the motel, i um, did some thinking about us and our sex life, and i realized there has been a disconnect, but it's coming from you."
3130,Bree,"well, i admit she plays her cards close to the vest, but some of you could benefit from that kind of quiet dignity, miss i-chew-gum- like-a-1930s-gun-moll."
1485,Bree,"danielle,i don't feel much like cooking tonight.i'm thinking of ordering a pizza."
2083,Bree,"okay, that's what i was thinking."
4065,Bree,"no, she has a choice. it's entirely possible to get what you want without being perceived of as a nagging shrew."
1939,Bree,that rosotto was perfect.
1679,Bree,"okay,peter,i just really--need us to be friends.when i'm with you,i'm not myself,which is a good thing."
2971,Bree,you are such a scamp.
2542,Bree,"yes, and get this--when adam said dylan was just going to keep asking questions, katherine said-- and i quote--""well, we're just gonna have to find better lies."" oh, hang on. i've got another call."
3157,Bree,i've already told you. turn yourself in to the police and let justice run its course.
406,Bree,then why is he so unhappy?
2558,Bree,ah-choo!
1509,Bree,what on earth?
1889,Bree,"um, we, uh, just came over to introduce ourselves, but we can, um, do that at another time."
3202,Bree,"please, danielle. you have no right to take him."
1760,Bree,"yes, it is."
3690,Bree,"oh, i think it's saturday."
3804,Bree,and admirable.
1865,Bree,come on.
159,Bree,yes.
3805,Bree,"my, what an interesting coat hanger. it's shaped like a sofa. please put it in the closet."
3220,Bree,"oh, hon, i don't think that's gonna fly. he's already rubbed too many members."
3414,Bree,you can't just up and move. you have a life here.
1866,Bree,what?
4069,Bree,i want a divorce.
1108,Bree,"thank you, george, for being so understanding."
3926,Bree,thank you for--checking in on him and for answering my question.
3210,Bree,"my company, which i formed when we were separated, is called mrs. van de kamp's catering. it's how i'm known."
3172,Bree,"andrew, dear, i'm going to take a little break. would you please tell this gentleman that if he calls me ""sweetie"" one more time, i'm gonna grab his camera and take picture of his colon."
636,Bree,"better still, be brutal."
2931,Bree,"or, uh, the unitarians. from what i hear, those folks are ""anything goes."""
289,Bree,"oh, i'm throwing you out. i've separated all your things into two sides. one side is yours, danielle, and the other one is andrews."
2493,Bree,"oh,my baby!"
3889,Bree,"that's sweet, but i've decided to focus on other pursuits at the moment."
2169,Bree,i'm so happy we did this.
3275,Bree,"i am sorry, but am i supposed to sit by while she degrades his body and his mind?"
361,Bree,what's that smell? have you been smoking marijuana?
531,Bree,it's time for your heart medication.
3448,Bree,"oh, i am so, so sorry."
194,Bree,"zach,i won't tell your father."
2674,Bree,tell your stepfather i'll be right out.
3303,Bree,we don't have to read them out loud.
1050,Bree,yes.
1457,Bree,"i am not sure,but i think there was a compliment in there somewhere,so thank you.but i am not an escort."
890,Bree,why are you shopping here? you live on the other side of town.
2151,Bree,"well, orson tells me that the two of you were very close, and out of respect for that friendship, i'm all ears."
694,Bree,"well, you should assume that it is."
905,Bree,"well, then how do people know because we both know that i wouldn't say anything."
4002,Bree,"well, what kind of a favor?"
3629,Bree,"well, at least gloria had the good taste to have a paralyzing stroke so we don't have to deal with her."
3588,Bree,"well, i just want you boys to know that i am comfortable with your lifestyle. now who would like a strawberry daiquiri?"
3319,Bree,where are you?
4077,Bree,my salad has plenty of bite. so--when are you moving out?
2367,Bree,"oh, you're a good husband."
148,Bree,i suppose i do owe you an apology.
1198,Bree,"george, you won't believe it. i just stopped itching."
3648,Bree,"it was going to be a surprise, you know, for your wedding. unfortunately, this whole silly oakdale thing has forced me to show my hand."
3141,Bree,"oh, i get it. so i'm desperate and vulnerable, and you're gonna swoop in and save the day. well, thank you very much. i'm fine."
4050,Bree,"so i'm just like everyone else, and you know everything i'm going to say."
3611,Bree,yes.
1147,Bree,i'm sorry. i was just attending to some last minute details. right this way.
2870,Bree,walter's gay?
2706,Bree,"that's not what i meant, and you know it, and as for your little imitation of me, i don't sound anything like that."
605,Bree,"so what are you saying, that the twins murdered martha?"
3316,Bree,i wanna buy you lunch and tell you in person. i will be at your office in two minutes.
1303,Bree,"that's what i thought, at first, but then having had time to think about it, i can't understand why she'd go to so much trouble. i mean, what would her motive be?"
2143,Bree,"oh, and one more thing--"
855,Bree,"oh, honey."
2654,Bree,"cram it, phyllis."
708,Bree,it just isn't you. and we feel that you need to spend some quality time thinking about the goals in your life and what kind of person you want to be.
1796,Bree,"andrew?honey,where are you?i got your message.what's the emergency?andrew?andrew?"
2227,Bree,"well, thank you! it did win me the blue ribbon at the gourmet county cook-off."
2254,Bree,are you all right?
2715,Bree,a what?
1546,Bree,"i do not have a hangover,andrew,because i was not drunk."
3921,Bree,i wanted to see you.
1813,Bree,"oh, my god, danielle.i am so sorry."
3007,Bree,"oh, that's so sweet, but--our house is livable again - the downstairs anyway - and we have imposed long enough. besides, mike is coming home tonight, and you're gonna need the house to yourselves."
4126,Bree,"i'll get back to you, uh, later."
2626,Bree,he wasn't banished.
3023,Bree,"oh, i see what's going on here. this is shameless emotional blackmail."
2808,Bree,"oh, dear god. at least let me buy you some decent furniture."
1112,Bree,"oh george, really?"
661,Bree,oh?
3413,Bree,maryland?
200,Bree,but how?
1779,Bree,"gaby,you can't promise her that."
2934,Bree,"oh! good morning, reverend. i brought your favorite-- blueberry scones."
4094,Bree,are you all right? what happened to your shirt?
24,Bree,what do you mean what's in this? it's salad.
2578,Bree,itch. itch.
1176,Bree,why should i feel guilty?
2201,Bree,"i'm sure she'll be back soon. why don't we, uh, go have some cookies?"
4020,Bree,wouldn't it be easier to just have him killed?
3329,Bree,you wanna work here?
751,Bree,brown or green?
228,Bree,"oh. so she would be in the room with us, while we make love?"
1028,Bree,am i a suspect?
665,Bree,"oh. we're gonna act like nothing is happening, and then, when we finish eating, we're going to walk out of here with all the dignity that we can muster."
2536,Bree,"well, you've certainly mastered that, dear."
1313,Bree,what?
3296,Bree,"orson, you weren't here. she came back. she was married to a lawyer. and don't forget, she is his mother! i tried to fight, but--"
3971,Bree,a bat?
3873,Bree,"you're telling me you own a mug with a picture of bernadette peters in ""gypsy""?"
170,Bree,"the point is i don't feel safe here, and i was wondering if you would spend the night."
1320,Bree,"george, would you please sit down? you're being rude."
2247,Bree,"yeah, and she'll take terrible care of herself and be dead in a year."
655,Bree,"maisy, please. i mean, we used to be good friends."
1312,Bree,"no. no. it's like i told you, the stone could just pop off at any second."
2885,Bree,"yes, but he's also-- he's got a great sense of--okay, do you know how hard it is to get a good contractor?"
1697,Bree,andrew falsely accused me of molestation--in a mall!
4,Bree,"of course, i will need the baskets back once you're done."
1557,Bree,"mrs. mccluskey,hi.have you seen the scavo boys?"
1925,Bree,i'm calling the police.
980,Bree,that's very sweet of you. thank you.
560,Bree,"well, it won't be easy at first. there'll be a lot of forced smiles and perfunctory love making, but after a few decades whiz by i'm sure i'll find a way to forgive him."
3103,Bree,"maybe not. we call gabrielle ""gaby."" i mean, perhaps there's a shortened version of ""maynard"" you could live with."
593,Bree,"so i guess we should, uh, get started. what do you want me to do?"
526,Bree,i want to keep the club membership. rex is terrible at tennis. and he hates buffets.
259,Bree,"why not? we haven't had sex for months, rex. most normal, red-blooded men would be climbing the walls by now."
1406,Bree,"i thought everybody knew.oh, i feel awful.oh, ida greenberg's behind you."
2089,Bree,"i know how painful this must be for you. it isn't easy for me either, considering andrew's role in it."
2311,Bree,i am no longer interested in your opinion. i thought i made that clear.
2215,Bree,"thank you. well, hello there! how pretty you look today! it's wonderful that you're up and about! you must be enjoying these colorful balloons!"
2436,Bree,what?
2363,Bree,"oh, so you're just gonna wait until she moves in?"
1359,Bree,''so what's happened?have you had any luck finding george?''
8,Bree,"susan? susan. i was just saying paul wants us to go over on friday. he needs us to go through mary alice's closet, and help pack up her things. he says he can't face doing it by himself."
458,Bree,"oh, uh, you remember mr. williams, our pharmacist?"
460,Bree,"well, um--"
397,Bree,"oh, hi gabrielle! what have you got there?"
3737,Bree,"well, that's an intriguing offer."
972,Bree,do not close that coffin.
532,Bree,"sweetie, i think it's too late."
2533,Bree,"no. no, i am not upset. i'm just confused as to why you seem so determined to get off on the wrong foot. first you bring a pie to lynette's, when i clearly assigned you the salad--"
2119,Bree,how can you sit there playing that ridiculous game?!your sister tried to kill herself.that doesn't upset you?
3372,Bree,"my name is bree, and i am an alcoholic."
2822,Bree,"good, because i already--told him."
3424,Bree,but this is orson's college roommate. and--he's quite the catch!
365,Bree,your son's urine.
513,Bree,oh george! what - what a surprise!
2265,Bree,i'll deal with you later.
2521,Bree,"i have been here for hours trying to replicate her recipe, and nothing has even come close!"
971,Bree,wait!
11,Bree,"first of all, your father can't eat onions, he's deadly allergic. and i won't even dignify your navy bean suggestion. so. how's the osso bucco?"
2216,Bree,"oh, i'm--i'm so sorry. the nurse pointed me over here. i'm looking for gloria hodge."
523,Bree,were you with a woman?
152,Bree,neither do i.
4081,Bree,jail?
2302,Bree,orson?
3590,Bree,"bob hunter, lee mcdermott, i would like you to meet andrew's new life partner, dr. alex cominis."
1873,Bree,and seriously-- i am not like these other people.
3626,Bree,"look, i know it's very difficult for two families to negotiate the holidays, but i feel strongly that this is not the best way to handle it, and i'm sure that the boys would agree with me."
1553,Bree,"all right,boys,let's have it."
3474,Bree,how could this be happening?
4008,Bree,"oh, really? what a delightful coincidence. you know, i could bake these for you every week, and all i'd need in return is just the tiniest of favors."
1010,Bree,"um, thank you, but i just couldn't."
1470,Bree,except for you.you're really good at it.
3260,Bree,i've already started. danielle! what a delightfully ethnic ensemble.
3158,Bree,well--so here we are.
645,Bree,"well, you heard your funny story, rex. why aren't you laughing?"
3669,Bree,where's katherine?
3537,Bree,very routine and--and practically outpatient.
3222,Bree,oh. i'm a little bit nervous. this is my first national interview. and i am a huge fan of your cookbooks.
3169,Bree,why am i surprised?
3822,Bree,see a perfectly innocent--bald-faced lie.
1242,Bree,hello.
2748,Bree,they're-- unsightly. i do not want our son to be teased--for being different. do you?
2178,Bree,should we go introduce ourselves?
225,Bree,connected?
3932,Bree,you have every right to hate me.
710,Bree,"hopefully, you won't have to be there for more than a few weeks."
1957,Bree,hummm.orson.
2017,Bree,"orson, you look so serious."
2446,Bree,"wow, somebody's--blonder."
1008,Bree,what?
2941,Bree,i was gonna ask the same of you. why are you in a catholic church?
1346,Bree,yes.
1595,Bree,"uh,mr. bormanis,i'll need a little time to think about this."
3345,Bree,"sorry, but i prefer their campaign."
1330,Bree,george! i have guests! what do you think you are doing?
3933,Bree,"i meant for asking you to come here, for insisting you turn yourself in. oh. now that i see this place, i don't know what i were thinking."
922,Bree,"no, and i need to clean out our rain gutters, and, uh, beneath the refrigerator, and i can't tell you how long it's been since i've replaced the shelf liner, so--"
1581,Bree,"not until you're 21.and if i had my way, you wouldn't get your hands on it until you're 50.i mean,we both know you're gonna waste every penny of it."
2902,Bree,"oh, sweetie, you're okay."
1708,Bree,i'm so sorry. i know that you're good friends.
114,Bree,"that being said, i do love what he've done with that lawn."
738,Bree,"porter, i warned you."
1534,Bree,oh.
3766,Bree,"well, not completely, but let's face it. you do cut corners. i mean, one of the things i can teach you is the importance of the attention to detail."
3554,Bree,fine. i just know i need my sleep tonight.
2570,Bree,"oh, good! katherine, i was hoping we'd get a chance to chat. open this now."
2413,Bree,"no, you're not."
1503,Bree,"um, about that-- um--"
2145,Bree,"oh, danielle, i thought you'd be with mr. faladi tonight."
1673,Bree,"well,i just really feel likei'm jeopardizing my recovery by switching--"
4063,Bree,"thanks, karl. i'm not even divorced yet, and once i am, i don't think you'd be my first choice as a matchmaker."
2239,Bree,why? what could she possibly have done to make you hate her so much?
1413,Bree,"okay, first of all, i want you to march back upstairs and tell your friend he is no longer welcome in this house."
2559,Bree,"oh! sorry, probably just allergies, but, you know, you don't want to take any chances."
3749,Bree,they are?
1302,Bree,"well, she did, and she said some pretty horrible things about you."
3393,Bree,you would do that?
3257,Bree,"here they come, finally."
516,Bree,"well, i mean, wouldn't you keep hoping that in time i would feel the same way about you as you feel about me?"
1683,Bree,eleanor!
2361,Bree,i will not have that woman as a neighbor. you have got to do something.
1452,Bree,"detective,i am not drunk,and i am not stupid.i know exactly what this is all about."
3464,Bree,"oh. ""the new christian reader"" just published an advance review of my cookbook. listen! ""mrs. van de kamp's colorful stories of her upbringing show her upstanding values, but her recipes are sinfully delicious."" they gave me four halos!"
3167,Bree,"leave the galleys in my office and tell the woman from ""the times"" to call me back in the morning. i'm gonna have a nice bubble bath with my husband. coming, orson!"
215,Bree,"oh,well, okay. i'll see you tomorrow then."
1419,Bree,"hi, karl. oh!oh, um, quick question--when someone discusses a sensitive situation with a lawyer such as yourself,when does attorney/client confidentiality kick in?"
717,Bree,you don't have a choice.
575,Bree,"why not? rex, please tell me. let me prove to you how much i love you."
1880,Bree,i have aspirin at home that packs more of a punch.
3707,Bree,"oh, we're having leftovers. you can heat them up yourself if you want."
2747,Bree,i'm only thinking of benjamin. be reasonable.
3644,Bree,"uh, thinking about it. they're thinking about moving to oakdale."
487,Bree,"i was so afraid when i suggested a picnic, that you'd make fun of me, but i just think it's such a lovely, old-fashioned way to spend an afternoon."
2230,Bree,okay! maybe i will share my secret ingredient.
1299,Bree,"i say, given your overall demeanor and your freewheeling use of epithets, i'm willing to bet that he was provoked."
2624,Bree,i have been awful. i wouldn't blame you if you stormed out right now.
314,Bree,but i'll never forgive them for growing up so quickly.
2024,Bree,we know what you think. now would you please leave us alone?
3846,Bree,and you hope to earn it back through larceny?
3452,Bree,"good. well, now that that's settled--let's make some pies."
3540,Bree,"orson, if we can't share a bed, it's going to hurt the intimacy of our marriage."
3245,Bree,you're still here? dinner is about to be served. whose seats are you in?
1775,Bree,we ask god to grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change--
2378,Bree,fishy? it couldn't be more obvious. alma killed monique. that's why she disappeared. and i bet she pulled the teeth so people would suspect her dentist husband.
2030,Bree,oh my god.
2250,Bree,thank you.
2664,Bree,and a retirement village is fun?
1029,Bree,"well, if i am, you're wasting your time. i loved rex and anyone who knows me will tell you that i was incapable of hurting him."
2848,Bree,we can't. there's a woman in there.
3556,Bree,i'm so thirsty.
942,Bree,"no. no, i can't afford to fall apart right now."
374,Bree,"oh, susan, you look so gorgeous."" ""doesn't she, edie?"
1713,Bree,"oh,honey,it's all right.i mean,with the new baby at home, i'm surprisedyou made it at all."
3907,Bree,i think a little more reverence for the dead is in order.
3361,Bree,"lynette, you're drunk."
2565,Bree,"well, i was hoping that you could use these last few weeks for reflection and personal growth."
2795,Bree,"hello, doctor."
3852,Bree,"andrew, cancel my lunch. no, everything's fine. your stepfather's just misplaced a few things, and i need to find them."
888,Bree,"all i'm saying is that we're both gonna die eventually, and in the time that we have left, whether it's two days or two decades, i think that we should be nice to each other."
961,Bree,you are no longer invited to the funeral.
2842,Bree,i can't help having a sympathetic face.
1043,Bree,"i was in shock, danielle. you know that. andrew, surely you don't think i murdered your father."
3402,Bree,"orson, please. you're putting me in an impossible position."
182,Bree,"zach,do you have any plans for dinner?"
2837,Bree,"sylvia, where are you going? sylvia, you need to come out of there."
477,Bree,sorry i can't invite you in for coffee.
4055,Bree,send me the papers when they're ready.
975,Bree,you look magnificent.
1731,Bree,you making fun of me?huh?
3344,Bree,no.
505,Bree,"oh, i was making macaroons before i left the house."
3487,Bree,you watched it?!
1756,Bree,"peter,let me be your rock.taking care of people is what i do best.drink your milk."
1158,Bree,my husband died thinking that i murdered him.
3394,Bree,and how is word going to spread?
2768,Bree,"i know how much you love benjamin. i guess--i guess i just have to remember that it's love that makes us a family and not blood. your son would like you to hold him. by the way, his hebrew name is simcha. i'll explain later."
4013,Bree,"thank you. oh, thank you, sweetheart."
688,Bree,"oh come on, don't be so dramatic. some of these places actually look fun. look. camp hennessey."" ""camp hennessey teaches kids respect for authority and boundaries in a summer camp-like atmosphere."
1628,Bree,"oh,and why is that?"
1711,Bree,"you know,it never ceases to amaze me how people can turn their backs on their own family.i mean--but it happens every day,doesn't it?"
16,Bree,that certainly would explain why you're always locked in the bathroom.
3513,Bree,"of course they can. if they read my book, that is. okay, truth be told--i'm far from perfect. only yesterday, i burned a whole tray of biscotti."
2148,Bree,yes. i wonder where she gets it.
1663,Bree,i actually don't want anything of the sort.
1556,Bree,porter! preston!this isn't funny!
2501,Bree,we're your friends. why would you shut us out?
978,Bree,no. in theory.
615,Bree,"andrew, this is not funny."
167,Bree,did you hear there was a break in at mrs fome's the other night?
2925,Bree,"oh, so you're--coming to bible study."
845,Bree,i saw you at alfredo's yesterday.
3642,Bree,"well, did it occur to you i might want to sit next to the boys?"
1115,Bree,oh.
2087,Bree,"hello, vera. i made you some of those, uh, shortbread biscuits that you like so much."
3159,Bree,i did not tell you to put mums in that arrangement! and don't point your finger at me or i'll snap it right off.
1073,Bree,exactly. i hope you don't mind.
2122,Bree,andrew!
322,Bree,i feel awful for carlos. that talk about children was obviously coming from his grief.
1618,Bree,"well,you know,before mike came along,i always just assumed they'd get back together."
3978,Bree,"oh, you know, i just remembered some business i have to discuss with andrew."
2164,Bree,"oh, they are a regular barrel of--tish!"
3851,Bree,i'm sure it'll turn up somewhere. well--i'm off.
2775,Bree,"well, that doesn't make caring for an infant any less tiring. can't we just give it a chance?"
1259,Bree,do you actually think they're gonna make fun of you?
3337,Bree,"he gets it, dear. honey, you're my partner in life. but if we want to keep it that way, we shouldn't mix marriage and business."
119,Bree,can i come in?
1064,Bree,"um, um, during the test, they asked me some questions about you and, um, us and whether we had a relationship and i said yes, because it's true. and then they asked me something else, something i hadn't considered."
740,Bree,"oh no, we had a wonderful time. although i think porter had a little less fun. okay, i'll bet."
2525,Bree,she will have stolen my entire identity.
1806,Bree,"well,good for you."
372,Bree,the same thing you just did to every memory i have of our marriage.
840,Bree,"oh, don't worry about it. here i want you to try one of these clams. i bet they're as good as the marinara sauce."
4033,Bree,that is none of your business.
475,Bree,"george, would you go out to dinner with me?"
3748,Bree,my food? what are you talking about?
321,Bree,thank you so much.
2697,Bree,how can i help?
3963,Bree,orson's not exactly the bar-fight type. he's more of a raised voices at-a-cheese-tasting type.
2650,Bree,"it's just a little, uh--"
3786,Bree,"orson, drop it. i am not telling you how much andrew makes."
3501,Bree,"all right, then, we'll see you soon."
3488,Bree,"oh, dear god. i can't look. really, andrew."
2124,Bree,they're sticking a tube down her throat. do you still think this is funny?
3604,Bree,hey there. do you have a second?
2735,Bree,"oh, that's ridiculous."
1965,Bree,i've never heard that.
3664,Bree,"well, we've got 15 minutes till the news is on. why not? i still can't get over the way alex behaved this morning. ""emasculating."" i' never heard such nonsense. don't you think so?"
373,Bree,why did carlos have to back out?
1971,Bree,okay.
4057,Bree,"see, this is why i wanted to check on my things. you don't leave a valuable painting on the damn floor. you need to put something underneath it."
358,Bree,"charming. what i was wondering was if you've bothered to spend any time reflecting on the reasons that you've been grounded, and all the pain that you've caused the solis family."
1591,Bree,and what might that be?
2071,Bree,"orson, i saw the two of you whispering right after dr. keck ran off. what happened?"
3417,Bree,come in.
2161,Bree,"that is ridiculous.orson did not kill alma.and besides,carolyn just apologized to me for that yesterday."
1206,Bree,i know.
173,Bree,that is for the kids' trip.
127,Bree,"lynette, you are a great mother. but let's face it, your kids are a challenge."
141,Bree,fine.
1631,Bree,you can't be serious.
2410,Bree,exonerate mike. how could you stand by and let an innocent man be dragged off to prison?
1460,Bree,i have been through enough humiliation for one day.i hope you have a better suggestion than that.
2632,Bree,then i'll give it back to you.
136,Bree,he hung up on me.
4091,Bree,a little? the man put chives in my parisian salad! he should be in a straightjacket!
1013,Bree,"i'm, uh, i'm going to see rex's lawyer. we're going to go over some details involving rex's will. phyllis, obviously, i'm just mortified over slapping you. i, i've just been in a weird place since rex's death, but, that's no excuse. i'm very, very sorry."
2591,Bree,"oh, my god."
3969,Bree,"oh, dear."
417,Bree,"and i am so thrilled to know that you still love me. because i want what's about to happen to you, to hurt as much is as humanly possible. i'm so glad you didn't die before i got a chance to tell you that."
968,Bree,"well, then why did you say those things to me?"
928,Bree,"it doesn't matter. from here on in, can we just say that we're even?"
1627,Bree,we are going home. wait tilli tell the judge about you stealing my credit cards and sneaking off.it's gonna do wonders for your little emancipation case.
642,Bree,"tisha. tisha. oh, i can tell by that look on your face you've got something good. now, come on, don't be selfish."
1515,Bree,"when it comes to betty applewhite,i know what i'm doing,and you two are just gonna have to trust me.and if you can't do that,then perhaps i've overestimated the depth of our friendship.now,if you'll excuse me--"
3288,Bree,"no, um, you take benjy upstairs. i'll get it. orson, could you get the mop, please?"
3201,Bree,"well, i think what gaby means is you were fairly awful to us right before you left, and this is our way of welcoming you back to hopefully not do it again."
1834,Bree,all righty.
2701,Bree,"try, um, gun city on route 6 by the baptist church. tell them i sent ya, and they'll give you a nice discount."
792,Bree,"oh, andrew. thank you. you don't know how much that means to me."
2556,Bree,"no. you know, i usually just call him ""doctor""."
3827,Bree,"lynette, tom, hi. i'd like you to meet my publisher, bruce."
4027,Bree,wipe your feet first. i just had the carpets cleaned. just because we're thieves doesn't mean we need to be untidy.
3069,Bree,"yes, eventually, with a big, dopey grin on your face."
63,Bree,"rex, wasn't that a lovely?"
1005,Bree,that's all right. it was really sweet of you to stop by.
4022,Bree,"well, i just never know with you. and don't call me ""freckles."""
2134,Bree,danielle.
1378,Bree,"andrew, i'm not trying to minimize my part in this. believe me, i, i hate myself for what's happened."
3730,Bree,a check. i understand you and tom are going through some rough times.
2481,Bree,"no,not at all!i'm just saying hello to a very dear friend of mine."
3992,Bree,"oh, right. karl's a divorce lawyer."
1587,Bree,"his lawyer? well,why on earth would andrew need a lawyer?"
81,Bree,not a drop!
2260,Bree,"i know she's a handful, but she deserves some compassion. the woman watched a dream die yesterday. i'm taking her dinner up."
1770,Bree,what?
1926,Bree,do you remember that girl melanie foster?matthew is the one who killed her.
3505,Bree,"any minute. oh, my gosh, andrew. don't you look sharp today?"
106,Bree,"i don't need much time, it just seems that you have more insight into my situation than i do. and i just think that-"
3242,Bree,"well, i know nothing. just keep me out of it. what is carlos doing?"
2950,Bree,lynette! you were the one who came to me. you sought me out.
866,Bree,hurry up. there're people waiting.
1552,Bree,"sure.just--just a moment,okay?"
2065,Bree,"well, that would certainly spare the family some embarrassment. why not throw in a killing spree, too?"
1734,Bree,"oh, your a.a. sponsor?"
1401,Bree,"oh, i just wanted to pick up some fresh croissants for breakfast."
2804,Bree,just a bit dizzy from holding my breath in your stairwell. may i come in?
1436,Bree,"oh,betty,if there's anything i can do,anything at all--"
1599,Bree,"oh,andrew,you don't think i love you enough to give up alcohol?"
288,Bree,"no, and in the future i would appreciate you keeping your ridiculous ideas to yourself!"
2661,Bree,what's so funny?
2897,Bree,"well, he doesn't mind."
4021,Bree,i was kidding!
2052,Bree,how did you find out that?
3810,Bree,tom has a lot on his mind. i'm sure he didn't mean it.
2545,Bree,"well, none that i recall."
2305,Bree,"the other night, you wanted a chance to explain everything. well, here it is, and i want it all. if i find out you've left anything out, then i will ask for that divorce."
2680,Bree,"i need something that will fly, phyllis."
1666,Bree,"i,um,i don't want a new sponsor.i'm-- i'm very comfortable working with you."
1598,Bree,"perception is reality,andrew.and if people perceive me to have a drinking problem,then i do.and i certainly don't want some idiotic judge using my hobby as an excuse to make you rich.so i'm simply going to give up my wine and become a recovering alcoholic."
1771,Bree,i don't care.
4047,Bree,i can't believe you went to all that trouble.
2979,Bree,"katherine, a waldorf salad is made with apples. it's tradition."
3566,Bree,"well, fridays are when orson plays golf. so friday's perfect. right, orson?"
1163,Bree,that was nice.
2508,Bree,"yeah, let's do it. um, gaby, why don't you bring your vegetable lasagna? susan, you do beverages, and, uh, katherine, why don't you bring a simple green salad?"
1733,Bree,"i'm sorry, peter,but, uh, who is this?"
1228,Bree,"george, rex hasn't even been dead for two months."
2263,Bree,is that alcohol? where did you get that?
2896,Bree,"oh, so why don't you take this piece of pie upstairs to julie?"
1593,Bree,"well,that's the silliest thingi've ever heard of.how would he support himself?"
3589,Bree,"well, orson and i thought it would be nice to share this special occasion with some dear friends."
3248,Bree,"yes, and he appears to be checking the guest list."
2368,Bree,why not? and what the hell was that on the porch?!
1909,Bree,"one can only hope.of course, if a doctor gets here first and sees that someone forgot to release me, i'm sure they'd get in a lot of trouble."
1613,Bree,"it's true. i'm coming here because of my son.you see, he's--he's trying to take me to court to become an emancipated minor,and he's planning on lying to the judge and telling him that i am some sort of dreadful lush."
1275,Bree,huh?
3565,Bree,"yes, that's the one. so anytime you wanna get in there and start hacking away, he's ready for you. aren't you, love?"
2561,Bree,you're 8 1/2 months pregnant! what in heaven's name were you doing roller-blading?
1797,Bree,"andrew?honey,what are you doing in my bed?"
1543,Bree,"oh,no,no,no,no.i'm okay."
85,Bree,"oh, well i don't have any personal issues. my only issue is that my husband wants to leave me, and how can i work on that if he's not in the room?"
1876,Bree,"you know that, um, that woman in the wheelchair?what's her story?"
1196,Bree,"you know what, george? we're gonna have a great time, because there's tons of fun stuff we can do that doesn't involve sex."
585,Bree,so? was it good for you too?
1114,Bree,"thank you, george."
2869,Bree,"oh, for god sakes. tell him to put on his big boy pants and find another girl."
2672,Bree,"oh, look, they have water aerobics. you should sign up."
1812,Bree,what?
1126,Bree,"yes, and i'm sure you will bury him with all the dignity of a dead hamster. no, i want rex released to me and i will make all the arrangements."
286,Bree,"yes. gabrielle, did you, or did you not offer to sponsor her?"
82,Bree,"well, the nurses at your office may start wondering why you're disappearing three times a week. tennis lessons are a plausible alibi."
1580,Bree,"andrew,we're not touching your trust fund."
2679,Bree,i'll say that you're broke and needed the money.
1179,Bree,"you can think whatever you want, but to be honest, i don't believe in the subconscious."
2741,Bree,"susan? hi. it's, uh, bree. i'm glad you're home. uh, listen, i-i thought i might stop by for a little visit."
2589,Bree,it'll just take a few seconds. these damn cords--
1396,Bree,get over here.now.
3397,Bree,"look, if we can't agree on something this basic, maybe we shouldn't work together."
1928,Bree,"no.i gave up on your brother, and i'm not gonna make that mistake with you."
608,Bree,"well, not recently, and i'd prefer not to tie up the line."
521,Bree,"oh my god! george, here."
9,Bree,are you ok?
1128,Bree,"well, i have some good news. the police are finally releasing rex's body."
3820,Bree,"well, look who's here. somebody owes me $20."
2445,Bree,"well, hello there, julie."
1588,Bree,"honey,what happened to-- to your face?"
2170,Bree,no. why?
686,Bree,they've been in the drawer for a few months. i had a feeling we might be needing them.
205,Bree,"oh, hi,rex. how are you? is something wrong?"
2194,Bree,"andrew, honey, would you please get the phone?"
3380,Bree,it's-- complicated.
278,Bree,"um, all this, um, wine is, uh, giving me a headache."
2197,Bree,"i'm fine. i just, i'm running out of food, and it's not as if i can go to the grocery store."
2629,Bree,"it's a surprise party, you daft woman! what makes you think i had a hand in the guest list?"
2400,Bree,"i'm sorry, but you've been out cold for ten hours, and we need to talk."
805,Bree,no. he just wants to be friends. he told me so.
602,Bree,"well, then the least we can do is go search his room and if we find any more of these, we'll confiscate them."
951,Bree,"anyway, i'm afraid that my visit has an ulterior motive. the organist at our church is on vacation, and edie britt mentioned that you used to be a concert pianist, and -"
2949,Bree,"well, yes."
3352,Bree,"oh, for heaven sakes, come back to bed."
3259,Bree,"i'm aware of what's at stake, orson."
1125,Bree,"thank you. so, uh, what will happen now?"
2338,Bree,"everyone, this is alma hodge, orson's first wife."
1940,Bree,oh.
2261,Bree,"oh, no, i'd rather do it myself. i wanna talk to her."
1518,Bree,"if the applewhites go to the police and tell them that your brother ran over mrs. solis,he could go to prison.how can you not understand that?"
3360,Bree,"would you excuse us, please?"
676,Bree,that is obviously different.
1070,Bree,no.
2233,Bree,"well, then talk to me. i know you're upset, but don't shut me out. please. please, gloria, let me in."
3945,Bree,do we really need to do this tonight? they're ashes. it's not like they're gonna go bad.
1056,Bree,"um, i, i was thinking of something else just then, so why don't you ask me the question again?"
3993,Bree,but i thought you just split everything done the middle.
2499,Bree,"because i'm her mother.and i know what i've created,and that's the real humiliation.orson.this child deserves better.and i know what to do now. please,please let me try."
3622,Bree,stop that! you can't call all the major holidays.
203,Bree,oh! you are going to love it! it has quite a kick..
2574,Bree,"edie, is that an engagement ring?"
3070,Bree,"i don't think so. i'd hate for him to be around when you had another attack of delayed morality, either with edie or behind the wheel of your car."
2391,Bree,"not as sorry as you are gonna be! orson, get up!"
191,Bree,you do?
176,Bree,"oh, hi,zachery. i'm sorry. the door was open and-"
3638,Bree,what are you doing?
1689,Bree,"yeah.okay,bye."
2719,Bree,"push, baby, push."
3956,Bree,"i hope so, because i just cannot take any more lying."
3074,Bree,what on earth could you possibly want?
2432,Bree,i'm so sleepy.
4114,Bree,"you know what i really truly want? revenge. i mean, if somehow we could level the playing field, then, um, maybe i could find a way to come back."
3920,Bree,really? because i would consider that a perk worth paying for.
562,Bree,i think it has something to do with why he had the affair.
1410,Bree,absolutely not.i think the best thing to do is just smile and pretend you don't know anything.
19,Bree,andrew. this is family time. i think we should all--
3567,Bree,"oh, he's not apprehensive. he's terrified. and i don't care, because he owes me one--a big one. don't you, darling?"
2684,Bree,my son--trying on his costume. he's going to be cher this year.
1912,Bree,"and why should they? so, um, alfred, i was wondering if you could maybe loosen my restraints. they're incredibly tight, and i'm sure there are no rules against making me more comfortable."
3339,Bree,"goodness, lynette. when you offered to share your thoughts on my campaign, i wasn't expecting anything quite so--elaborate."
3853,Bree,how about a confession? sit down. start talking.
2019,Bree,"i'm sorry, but i had to ask."
1033,Bree,"well, it was a marriage. of course there were problems."
1804,Bree,i have to.i can't be around you anymore.i'm just not strong enough.
415,Bree,"that's okay. how are you now, rex? are you strong enough to listen to the things i need to tell you?"
1030,Bree,you talked to phyllis.
4117,Bree,why would you say that to me?
3301,Bree,here's my cookbook.
354,Bree,"i understand that good help is hard to find, but stealing a family's nanny is so--unseemly."
1568,Bree,"now that you're speaking to me in a fairly accusatory tone,may i remind you that i was doing you a favor?"
1564,Bree,penny?
3671,Bree,and bring some steak sauce.
2162,Bree,"oh, you don't believe any of that nonsense, do you? do you?"
2929,Bree,"well, it's just that in our church, people don't talk back to the minister."
1875,Bree,"you, too?"
1001,Bree,"um, i'm all right."
3824,Bree,bruce. hello. come on in. thank you so much for joining us tonight. may i take your coat?
3985,Bree,wait. i'm not planning on giving him half. it's my business.
392,Bree,trust is overrated.
3870,Bree,what were you doing at bob and lee's?
2208,Bree,"oh,don't be silly.i'm sending one to the man who reads our gas meter.i can certainly send one to your mother."
3,Bree,"well, the least i could do is make sure you boys had a decent meal to look forward to in the morning. i know you're out of your minds with grief."
3225,Bree,"hi, linda."
545,Bree,thank you.
974,Bree,give me your tie!
3217,Bree,you can't come. sorry. i just had to rip the band-aid off.
990,Bree,"so am i, but no one would ever know it with your incessant caterwauling."
180,Bree,"zach,she would be very proud of you. what happened to your varnish?"
4108,Bree,my knees haven't buckled yet.
3378,Bree,"well, it's just vulgar to discuss business at a party."
3064,Bree,so are you thinking of moving onto the lane?
3742,Bree,"oh, that sounds nice. can we walk and talk?"
3330,Bree,"well, that's certainly an intriguing notion. but wouldn't it be awkward having me as your boss?"
3549,Bree,that doesn't sound right.
1471,Bree,"well,you moved into your house in the middle of the night.god knows what you moved in that you didn't want anybody to see.people hear sounds coming at all hours from there.and,oh,what was the last one?oh,right--they found a dead body in front of your home.everybody talks about the applewhites,but nobody can figure out exactly what you people are hiding.so congratulations.your secrets are safe--for now."
790,Bree,because if you don't change who you are then you won't go to heaven.
1193,Bree,george--
832,Bree,"mmmh! oh, george, you have got to taste this. it's a little messy but.."
1180,Bree,i don't believe him. he is so brazen.
3788,Bree,"orson, i'm preparing a buffet for 200. i don't have time to explore my hypothetical career in the adult film industry."
1116,Bree,"george, it's my pattern. where did you find it?"
3119,Bree,"oh, reverend green, please don't be upset."
812,Bree,"yes, we have. . and you still don't know when i need you to lie."
525,Bree,i don't think that would be wise.
2293,Bree,"what?! no, i did not, and i don't plan to."
3094,Bree,wonderful! with a little goat cheese.
1233,Bree,"it was just awful. george had a ring. his mother and her friend were there with champagne. if i had said no, it would have devastated him."
3964,Bree,great. be back in a minute.
745,Bree,i never said i was perfect.
3187,Bree,"well, yours calls for minced curly leaf parsley. mine calls for minced flat leaf."
1871,Bree,"oh, i just thought it would be a lovely place to take a nice, long rest."
1266,Bree,there you go. all done.
2656,Bree,what?
3560,Bree,i just don't understand why i feel so loopy.
2658,Bree,"you don't even know what that means, you petulant sock puppet!"
118,Bree,open the door please.
6993,Gabrielle,"oh,focus,you idiot!come on.when are we leaving?"
6136,Gabrielle,carlos. no trishelle tonight?
6984,Gabrielle,what are you talking about?
5140,Gabrielle,"it couldn't hurt! ever since you've been in here, all we do is bicker!"
4163,Gabrielle,"oh, excuse me."
7711,Gabrielle,carlos? kitchen. now.
6175,Gabrielle,"i don't want to, but if you wear them one more time, they're gonna ask me themselves."
8620,Gabrielle,"i don't agree, fran. you know, carlos went blind for five years. we went broke. we almost lost our house. but we worked our asses off and we made it back."
7210,Gabrielle,and isn't there an election around that time?
7428,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm sorry. i forgot that was open. let's do it over here, on the table."
5991,Gabrielle,"uh, sure, who doesn't love a string quartet. but if you got a band, maybe people could dance as opposed to sway."
5787,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
5559,Gabrielle,maybe not--but you certainly are.you missed a spot.
5178,Gabrielle,about time.
4240,Gabrielle,"hey, ash. i was at the mall, and i saw this. thought you might like it. she's hawaiian. her name is princess kahaluia. and, and i think it means little waterfall- or big pond-or something."
4549,Gabrielle,"of course. i made ten thousand dollars a day. i don't expect to, to make that here."
7862,Gabrielle,"do it. i need to hit something, and it needs to be you."
7348,Gabrielle,aah!
5047,Gabrielle,don't you think i have better things to do than to bring you checks every day? checks that i could be signing at home?
4457,Gabrielle,"oh, no."
6007,Gabrielle,"fine. you can come to bree's wedding reception, as my guest."
6978,Gabrielle,mrs. mccluskey! enjoy the wedding?
7928,Gabrielle,"oh, shoot. i can't reach it."
5574,Gabrielle,"oh, bree,come on, dish already!"
5064,Gabrielle,"honey, i think this is a mistake. if we give in to extortion, the guy's just gonna keep coming back for more money."
5302,Gabrielle,do you like it? i picked it up on the way here.
5440,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos."
5142,Gabrielle,"oh, don't judge me! you're not in here because you got caught helping the poor."" ""see, we'd be enjoying this argument more if we had something to look forward to!"
8473,Gabrielle,"well, you know what? i have a voice inside my head that says you're wrong. it tells me that 50 years from now, you and i will still be wearing dresses too tight and walking in heels too high and going to bars where we'll meet old geezers who'll buy us drinks with the last of their social security checks."
4401,Gabrielle,i sure would.
5042,Gabrielle,damn straight. what you did was worse.
5586,Gabrielle,i like a lot.
7841,Gabrielle,"yeah, and the water was as flat as the ad campaign. your martini was as dry as the ad campaign. let it go."
7683,Gabrielle,"my daughter does not have a weight problem. she has a little baby fat, that's all. in fact, the only problem she has is this store being completely unprepared for a perfectly average 4-year-old girl. just ring it up."
4539,Gabrielle,"carlos, did you know what tanaka was doing?"
8033,Gabrielle,"the car needed tires. how was i supposed to know he was gonna get his sight back? i mean, of all the rotten luck."
7414,Gabrielle,"wow. that's-- a really long time. but for better or worse, right?"
8334,Gabrielle,the same compensation package! we're rich!
6158,Gabrielle,"oh,god,yes!oh,ride 'em,cowboy!oh,yes,god!take me home,philly!you should wear a saddle!yes! yes!"
5430,Gabrielle,"i may be a catholic, but i am so not above slapping a nun."
5188,Gabrielle,"by the way, he was wearing a suit. how do you know he had a good body?"
8642,Gabrielle,"what's there to talk about? you won't even let the girls get a golden retriever, and now you wanna take in a teenager?"
8491,Gabrielle,"ugh, and i have a garden club meeting."
5026,Gabrielle,the three of us? how exactly does that benefit carlos?
5452,Gabrielle,okay.
7793,Gabrielle,today doesn't count. today i was mad.
7125,Gabrielle,why'd you take your wig off?
5644,Gabrielle,"i'm the one who was sleeping with your son,but it's over now."
7556,Gabrielle,"okay, there may be two tramps in this house, but only one of 'em is getting paid."
5486,Gabrielle,okay.what's the 1%?
6172,Gabrielle,so you're not laying on anything in this house until you take a shower.
5907,Gabrielle,i don't wanna go alone.it was your idea in the first place.
8677,Gabrielle,of what?
7901,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa. nobody used the ""o"" word."
6911,Gabrielle,i hope i didn't wake you last night. i was at susan's till midnight.
7085,Gabrielle,"oh, so you're not engaged?"
8070,Gabrielle,i know. life is good. now all we have to do is find him a job.
6765,Gabrielle,excuse me. excuse me. excuse me.
5630,Gabrielle,"here's how it's gonna work--you're gonna check yourself into the hotel,and then tomorrow,you're gonna plant your child bearing hips on a plane,and you're gonna leave our lives forever."
8447,Gabrielle,"oh, i feel so sorry for all those other girls in the bar."
5788,Gabrielle,"oh,you're welcome.all right,lily needs to be bathed and put to bed.i don't wanna miss my yoga class."
5915,Gabrielle,"oh, honey!oh, you're not dead!"
6186,Gabrielle,show-offs.
5829,Gabrielle,i don't want my money back.i want my baby!
8424,Gabrielle,"tight, just the way i like it."
7401,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know, but i'm no good single. honestly, i don't know how you do it."
5327,Gabrielle,"you know, i also got a facial, and later on, i'm gonna get a pedicure and an eyebrow wax, so there."
6900,Gabrielle,"well, we got chocolate and wine.your place or mine?"
5565,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's about right."
6705,Gabrielle,"half the fun? oh, honey, if i ever do say yes--you're gonna adjust that percentage way down."
4379,Gabrielle,hi john. motel. ten minutes. be there.
6616,Gabrielle,"no, there will be no clapping! you, moron, come with me!"
4767,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so thoughtful of you, but actually no."
4837,Gabrielle,then i'll go to the police.
6958,Gabrielle,what are you working on so late?
7889,Gabrielle,"$50,000?"
5354,Gabrielle,it's so good to see you!
6819,Gabrielle,"oh! no, i mean it."
6238,Gabrielle,"yeah, everything's fine. having a little squabble. give us a minute. carlos, where do you think you're going with that?!"
4498,Gabrielle,"tom, say something!"
5591,Gabrielle,what?
4573,Gabrielle,"uh, no! no, no! that's unreasonable. what do they expect us to do for money?"
5825,Gabrielle,what?
8277,Gabrielle,"oh, that shayla."
6067,Gabrielle,"your company? you have a company now?oh, my gosh, when i met you, all you had was a bike."
6235,Gabrielle,it's kind of on the fritz.
6408,Gabrielle,yeah.
4719,Gabrielle,it's definitely on the short list.
4180,Gabrielle,out the window.
7275,Gabrielle,where'd he go?
7626,Gabrielle,"so sarcastic, but what would you expect from a ""lynette""? what? if your name was ""francesca"", you wouldn't have time for sarcasm. you'd be too busy having sex on a vespa."
8607,Gabrielle,i bet i know what happened. she drank it away. that one new year's eve where she got so plowed she fell in the koi pond--
4538,Gabrielle,i'm going to kiss my husband now!
7466,Gabrielle,"no, no, no, no, no. wait! okay, you know what? this is getting ridiculous."
4408,Gabrielle,i'm not jealous. i just don't like to share.
5747,Gabrielle,"no,thanks.you guys look like you got it covered."
4916,Gabrielle,"no, it was-you just had to be there. but, my point is, that i'll be an awful mother. i'm selfish and i'm self-centred. and the only person more self-centred than me is carlos! i mean, he's so self-centred that he doesn't even know how self-centred i am! we'd be terrible parents!"
8401,Gabrielle,all gone. now let's do this. it'll be like old times.
5501,Gabrielle,"oh,my god!"
7141,Gabrielle,that's the fennel.
4146,Gabrielle,fine. i'll go. but i'm keeping my back pressed against the wall the entire time.
5212,Gabrielle,what?
8120,Gabrielle,"all right, that's it! i'm calling your father! you are gonna get it now! he is gonna tear into you! it is gonna be a bloodbath!"
8058,Gabrielle,you were blind and depressed. i didn't wanna add to it.
7784,Gabrielle,"you can dye that hair all you want, but the gray's just gonna keep coming."
8437,Gabrielle,"and after that five minutes is up, then what do we do?"
6909,Gabrielle,"oh, yes! let's celebrate. more chocolate. and just so you know, if i was a lesbian, i'd totally do you."
5431,Gabrielle,"boy, sister mary's done a number on you."
6230,Gabrielle,"come on, just give me one clean shot at him. i'm willing to do the time!"
7945,Gabrielle,"carlos, it's not worth it. she's really starting to freak me out."
7143,Gabrielle,and we can rinse it off--in three to five minutes. but before we do that--
4235,Gabrielle,i don't know. hey! you!
6519,Gabrielle,a whole day?
6796,Gabrielle,"i've been doing some thinking, and you know how--how do i put this? you know how you feel like sometimes people hate you?"
4857,Gabrielle,what?
7994,Gabrielle,"it's okay, it's okay. let her talk. at least she's being honest. it's the kind of support and friendship i need right now."
8465,Gabrielle,"well, i guess i could do that. or i could do this. i should make some kind of speech. but think it's enough. we both know i crushed you, right? now if you'll excuse me, swizzle stick number 17 has a yacht and giant feet."
6997,Gabrielle,"okay,that's all right.i'll just take a cab and meet you."
6245,Gabrielle,he's cute.
6224,Gabrielle,"yeah, let's give him the scoop on the neighborhood."
6565,Gabrielle,"well, let's just say it's going to be served upstairs and involves whipped cream."
7729,Gabrielle,really? we'd love to.
8469,Gabrielle,"oh, please. you're gorgeous. and you are going to stay that way forever."
6902,Gabrielle,please. mike is not karl.
4260,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, he's just always given me the creeps. haven't you guys notices that he's got this ""dark thing"" going on? there's something about him that just feels-"
8030,Gabrielle,it was? i didn't know that. i thought it was some stupid collectors item.
4304,Gabrielle,i may be a while. and i may get a facial.
4532,Gabrielle,"say, um, could i store some odds and ends in your garage?"
5745,Gabrielle,i forgot the lamaze book in my purse!
4355,Gabrielle,she sounds nice.
5672,Gabrielle,"carlos,we're catholics,okay?god is pretty johnny one note on the whole subject of procreation.hey,and will you stop with this defeatist attitude?okay,do you wanta baby or not?"
5373,Gabrielle,you mean to tell me that this miraculous conversion of yours has nothing to do with fact that the woman standing outside is a knock-out?
7295,Gabrielle,"well, that's weird. what--what do you think that means?"
7324,Gabrielle,victor!
5185,Gabrielle,"oh, bob, you beat your wife. you are so not allowed to gasp."
4775,Gabrielle,being poor? a little.
4537,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, i love you so much! i would give up a house full of expensive junk just to put this behind us, and have you home with me."
5265,Gabrielle,"get me into this dress, and i will pay you ten more dollars a week."
4886,Gabrielle,"oh no, you shouldn't."
4829,Gabrielle,i'll bet.
5450,Gabrielle,you're not serious.
6259,Gabrielle,divorce.
4402,Gabrielle,"oh, and i would so love to help you get there."
5146,Gabrielle,"yeah, but that was a jealously thing. the man that my husband was trying to kill in court is not the least bit gay. trust me."
4288,Gabrielle,i think he's lying.
5534,Gabrielle,stop it. let's just enjoy the here and now.we're together. our marriage is back on track. life is good.
4367,Gabrielle,"oh, no, john, please don't say that. i have everything under control."
4866,Gabrielle,thank you.
8037,Gabrielle,"oh, please. this is important."
6643,Gabrielle,"it was okay. you know, you told a few good jokes. you're sorta charming. you're not bad-looking. i just think i can do better."
5317,Gabrielle,you said you were leaving.
6923,Gabrielle,press? at our wedding?
8179,Gabrielle,eli would have said that's more than most people get.
5339,Gabrielle,"fine, if i do this, will you go?"
7660,Gabrielle,what's wrong with my voice?
7733,Gabrielle,what kind of man leaves his sick wife at home to go party with mommy?!
4277,Gabrielle,"yeah? well i don't like your ironing, so there."
4900,Gabrielle,it's-it's a sort of- a government sponsored sabbatical-
7480,Gabrielle,that's a really mean way to put it.
5996,Gabrielle,i know he matches the drapes!
7543,Gabrielle,that wasn't his biceps. why do you think he rushed out of here?
5346,Gabrielle,thank you.
4853,Gabrielle,obviously a few more.
6868,Gabrielle,i think so.
6160,Gabrielle,i never said that.
6676,Gabrielle,you do not have to pay for my dress.
5446,Gabrielle,"yes,i would have."
5386,Gabrielle,"i have to, uh--"" ""uh, here have some of this. no one needs to know."
5866,Gabrielle,"well,honey,she's a virgin.who knows why virgins do anything?"
7896,Gabrielle,"oh, i need to sweet-talk him into giving carlos two months off."
6778,Gabrielle,"wait, wait. you're not gonna embarrass me with some sappy toast, are you?"
8046,Gabrielle,really? that makes me feel so much better. you wouldn't believe all the stupid things i've been worried about.
7745,Gabrielle,are you serious?
7557,Gabrielle,"there have been men coming out of her room at all hours of the night, and i saw her counting a wad of cash. so long story short, i need your help to get that hooker out of my house."
5489,Gabrielle,okay! okay!i get your point.
7620,Gabrielle,"well, i couldn't risk doing it in my room. ever since carlos went blind, he's developed a strong sense of smell. i don't know if you happened to catch a whiff of roy, but that is one telltale odor."
7629,Gabrielle,"that little snitch. i can't believe she did that! well, thanks for letting me know."
5205,Gabrielle,"but, carlos-"
4799,Gabrielle,monetary compensation? you're trying to buy us off?
4369,Gabrielle,hey! so what did i miss?
7251,Gabrielle,knows what?
7838,Gabrielle,not if she wants to see her favorite dolly alive.
4978,Gabrielle,"well, if you saw what he did to our pogonias you'd slap him too."
6184,Gabrielle,i'm just gonna say it. tequila makes me happy.
4159,Gabrielle,"well, yeah."
5834,Gabrielle,"carlos, do something!"
7097,Gabrielle,yeah! let's play!
4688,Gabrielle,"well, now we have something to talk about. you."
8224,Gabrielle,"well, they're crazy. he yells, and they jump. he tells them to run all the way over here, and they do it."
8605,Gabrielle,no! i didn't want to embarrass her.
6573,Gabrielle,"oh, i think you've got lots of choices. here's one of them."
5034,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i don't need to take a test. i am just trying to reassure my husband of what i know is true in my heart. so if you could just slip me someone else's test results, i could make my own. i got photoshop for christmas. oh, come on. you look like a fun-loving girl. i am sure you've been in a couple hairy situations of your own."
8513,Gabrielle,"hey, tom."
5549,Gabrielle,"and if that wasn't enough, he is saying her name in his sleep. it's disgusting.he's like a lovesick puppy."
6064,Gabrielle,thank you.
7696,Gabrielle,"honey, i know you wanna go home and watch your cartoons, but you had a lot of cake, so i was thinking i'd take you to the park. that way, you could run around and get some nice, fun exercise."
8146,Gabrielle,you just got home!
5999,Gabrielle,stop eating my fries!
6967,Gabrielle,"as far as i'm concerned, it's just in the nick of time."
6229,Gabrielle,i said dead!
7329,Gabrielle,"yeah, and seeing how he's the rich mayor of a small town with various thugs and cops at his disposal, carlos and i thought it would be safer if we got the heck out of dodge."
4914,Gabrielle,"yes. and its impossible, i'm on the pill-which you probably think is a sin, but it works. it's a 99.9% effective sin."
7288,Gabrielle,"carlos, if victor had lived, he would've killed us. i'm thinking we already had our miracle."
6285,Gabrielle,"what, i slam one dress, and you quit on me?"
6373,Gabrielle,"well, that's true--"
4301,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, whatever. it's rude."
5368,Gabrielle,huh?
8637,Gabrielle,"trash don't change, sweetheart. she's up to something. now come on, let's go grab a lawn chair before we get stuck on the grass with the fire ants."
6256,Gabrielle,"you look great.well, apparently, taking a .38 slug to the shoulder agrees with you."
8653,Gabrielle,"you know, the girls have chores, too. it's how we teach 'em responsibility. speaking of which, uh--curfew's 10:00, 11:00 on weekends. does that seem reasonable?"
8073,Gabrielle,i'm now speaking for carlos. he'll take it.
4507,Gabrielle,i'm the one who was sleeping with your son. i'm so sorry.
7834,Gabrielle,"i'm not going back, carlos. i can't. if juanita doesn't get her playdate, you're not getting yours."
5437,Gabrielle,poor baby's gone his whole life without caviar. now that's suffering.
4462,Gabrielle,"listen, betty! okay? you're not quitting on me now. we're going to find you a gown. it's going to be black, and slimming, and you're going to look great! i need you to be brave now."
4454,Gabrielle,what i want is to be happy.
7381,Gabrielle,"oh, al."
7732,Gabrielle,"that was mr. bowman, wasn't it?"
7259,Gabrielle,i'm not?
4804,Gabrielle,"i'm so lucky to have you,"
5762,Gabrielle,"look,just buckle up!"
5716,Gabrielle,"well,like they say,there's no such thing as a free lunch."
6945,Gabrielle,"okay, maybe a little, but it'll be weirder if you don't."
7320,Gabrielle,"well, who cares? the important thing is that he's safe, and we're gonna nurse you back to health, and i think that would happen a lot faster if we all clear out. thank you."
8115,Gabrielle,"it is for you. now move! juanita solis, i am not kidding. okay. that does it. juanita. if you think i'm not gonna drag you to the bathroom, you are sadly mistaken!"
7648,Gabrielle,"ellie, you can't call me! the cops are all over my ass because they think i helped you escape."
7163,Gabrielle,"as soon as we get around the corner, we're gonna have to adjust this horn."
7008,Gabrielle,and money.they've been remodeling for weeks.
4216,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. carlos, what have you done?"
7053,Gabrielle,"what, is this a test of our friendship?"
7228,Gabrielle,"this is nice. i didn't order a stretch, but i'll take it. victor."
6170,Gabrielle,okay.
4960,Gabrielle,"um, carlos is unavailable at the moment."
6236,Gabrielle,if only you'd come ten minutes earlier.
7028,Gabrielle,are you serious?
8452,Gabrielle,and susan?
7089,Gabrielle,"adam, i feel the tag of my dress sticking out, and i can't reach it. do you mind?"
4483,Gabrielle,"okay, yes, but you have to promise not to tell anybody."
5571,Gabrielle,"i think that's the right decision.you know,i made a decision, too.the answer to your question earlier is yes."
6052,Gabrielle,what's that?
7352,Gabrielle,"you! aah! oh! oh! no! no! what did you do?! what did you do, edie?!"
5191,Gabrielle,"yeah. i thought you'd schedule an appointment later. right now, i'm, i'm sort of disgusting and sweaty."
8007,Gabrielle,"hi, dr bach! how are you?"
4421,Gabrielle,you can't go on like this. you have to take care of yourself.
8619,Gabrielle,"oh, fran, i'm so sorry. you didn't have any family to turn to? any friends?"
7266,Gabrielle,"it's in there. well, maybe he wanted it to muffle the gun."
7693,Gabrielle,"all i'm saying is that our daughter has a weight problem, and the sooner we admit it, the better. carlos: she's only 4. but, you know, you want her to develop a weight problem? go ahead. nag, criticize, make her feel self-conscious. see what happens."
4956,Gabrielle,yeah. you see pregnant women have very strong urges.
5267,Gabrielle,"bree, it's still too easy to breathe. you've gotta make it tighter."
8021,Gabrielle,"mmm, i remember that place."
5692,Gabrielle,"wow, that--that sounds like interesting work."
7030,Gabrielle,"generally speaking, women don't leave their husbands for guys who have girlfriends. just boot the bi*ch. what are you afraid of?"
6424,Gabrielle,there. i'm done. let's go.
5403,Gabrielle,who's sister mary bernard?
8408,Gabrielle,"you know, i should get back."
7856,Gabrielle,"well, i wish he'd stop doing that. nobody likes a fickle god."
6300,Gabrielle,"stop, stop."
6182,Gabrielle,hey! cocktails? nobody called me?
4393,Gabrielle,"it's me. don't turn around, my mother-in-law can see you."
7046,Gabrielle,"oh, come on. let's dig into the pie. looks amazing."
7775,Gabrielle,that m.j.'s getting beat up by a little girl.
7353,Gabrielle,you just threw my money in a tornado. i am not getting in there with you.
5983,Gabrielle,"boy, those people just don't have a sense of humor, do they?"
4314,Gabrielle,she's watching her mexican soap opera. the reverend's virgin daughter is about to be seduced by the escaped desperado. so until she puts out juanita won't even know that i'm gone.
5973,Gabrielle,but you're gonna get married.you wouldn't buy a car without at least taking it for a little test drive.it's not like you've never slept with a guy you weren't married to.
6620,Gabrielle,"okay, i'll take my chances."
8040,Gabrielle,"yeah, you know what? i'm gonna have to call a big, fat per nulla on that one."
4744,Gabrielle,and please tell rex i said hello.
6454,Gabrielle,"oh, now you're gonna give me attitude?!"
7973,Gabrielle,don't talk like that. you want a cheeseburger or something?
7833,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. way out."
6296,Gabrielle,"good comparison, because it's gonna take a miracle to turn these mutts into show dogs."
6560,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so sweet, but i, uh--"
5665,Gabrielle,"great,and can we take some fake pictures to document it?"
6621,Gabrielle,bless you.
5721,Gabrielle,wow. you're a lot smarter than i thought.
6123,Gabrielle,"that's too bad, because i don't love you."
8104,Gabrielle,you know what would lift your spirits? we should all do a spa weekend.
4470,Gabrielle,vaguely.
5990,Gabrielle,"once that baby comes,i'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone."
5593,Gabrielle,"well, who's forcing her?we'll pay her whatever she wants.and the best part is,with her resum,any wage will look good."
4254,Gabrielle,oh he used to have a thing for spiked heels.
5469,Gabrielle,lynette thinks i was hitting on you at bree's party.
7355,Gabrielle,can i say something?
7161,Gabrielle,no way. it's gonna take more than a guy with mini binoculars and a bag of doughnuts to keep me under lock and key. i'll be there as soon as i can.
5538,Gabrielle,i'm sorry.i can't promise that.
4398,Gabrielle,"hey, danielle."
5683,Gabrielle,"okay, this isn't easy to say,so i'm just gonna say it,but have you taken a good look at her?"
4302,Gabrielle,"mama, i'll be right back. i'm going to the store."
8569,Gabrielle,"yeah, it doesn't really go with your skin tone either, but i can only deal with one disaster at a time. ooh. asian girl. close enough."
5759,Gabrielle,"oh,for god's sakes.just take the baby."
5182,Gabrielle,i don't know. i hired a brilliant lawyer to get my husband out of this hellhole and he fired him. for no reason at all.
8272,Gabrielle,"i mean, let's be honest, susan. you weren't exactly over the moon when you heard they were gonna live together."
5855,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei?i made you some hot cocoa.i guess the baby thing didn't really appeal to you,huh?i know it's a lot to ask,it's just,carlos and i think of you as family.don't you think of us as family?"
4663,Gabrielle,"well, it's not really an emergency."
8489,Gabrielle,you're good at this girl talk thing.
7011,Gabrielle,so i hear congratulations are in order.edie just announced you're getting married.best wishes!
4551,Gabrielle,"uh, what else do you have?"
5347,Gabrielle,"uh, i don't know. i can't see him."
6985,Gabrielle,holy crap!
5070,Gabrielle,"oh, i see. well, uh, your boyfriend asked my husband to give this to you. it's a sort of favor. it's all there. seven thousand dollars."
7957,Gabrielle,we're done here. good bye.
5933,Gabrielle,"you don't even have to say it out loud.if you see hymen, just give me a thumbs up."
5800,Gabrielle,"oh,that's my little girl.your chakra lining up nice for mommy?that's my girl."
7019,Gabrielle,affair?i thought we were talking about runng away together.
7151,Gabrielle,and i was married when we got together.
7467,Gabrielle,"let me go! well, it's official. i'm going to hell."
5441,Gabrielle,"so i finally said,if i'm head cheerleader,then nobody wears panties."
5660,Gabrielle,fine. we won't use it.
7724,Gabrielle,"oh, don't be silly, carlos. we're still on everyone's list."
7740,Gabrielle,poor blind bastard. i'll meet him outside.
5213,Gabrielle,are you okay?
4433,Gabrielle,"in case you've forgotten, before we got married, we made a deal. no kids."
8028,Gabrielle,"damn it, carlos. what are you, a moron?"
5260,Gabrielle,but i'm only three months pregnant. women don't show at three months.
4169,Gabrielle,"you guys check out mary alice's clothes? size 8, hah! she always told me she was a size 6. guess we found the skeleton in her closet."
6410,Gabrielle,"i--am fine. yes,i just remembered today's my mother's birthday. can we stop by the florist on the way to the shelter?"
7182,Gabrielle,"well, i think you're paraphrasing. okay, seriously, you have to go."
7207,Gabrielle,and you flew all the way here to twist my arm?
7545,Gabrielle,"no, it's gutsy. well, we like you, ellie, and if you have first and last months' rent, we'd like you even more."
4864,Gabrielle,"i'm unhappy. carlos and my marriage. i don't have options and it's driving me crazy. every time something went south in my life, i always had a plan b. now i feel like i have nothing."
5311,Gabrielle,i'm gonna call the police!
6147,Gabrielle,"well, now you know."
5135,Gabrielle,"carlos, will you calm down?"
5987,Gabrielle,xiao mei is going to be fine!once that baby comes her slate is going to be wiped clean.she's going to walk away and live her american dream!me?i'm going to be stuck!a single mother raising a child alone.haggling with lawyers over who gets the kid at christmas.my american dream is officially dead.
8054,Gabrielle,there.
7160,Gabrielle,"brett, when's the last time a cable guy waited for anyone? i see a lot of lawn mowing in your future. hey, it's me again. you're not gonna believe this. before victor left on his business trip, he hired someone to tail me."
6660,Gabrielle,i mean it this time.
4305,Gabrielle,yeah.so?
8590,Gabrielle,"well, mommy shouldn't have said that. just, when aunt bree started bragging about her prada bag, mommy kind of lost it."
6591,Gabrielle,"okay, okay, stop talking. i'm getting nauseous."
6431,Gabrielle,"i mean, you saw me. i went on a picnic and ate pudding out of a can. it was horrible."
5468,Gabrielle,"damn it, lynette, if this has to do with that stupid kiss the other night,i'm gonna lose it!"
7778,Gabrielle,yeah? or maybe you could teach your son to grow a pair!
8499,Gabrielle,"well, that's three. who else can we get?"
5583,Gabrielle,"no, this is couture!this rip has to be fixed by an experienced tailor.you can't just--holy crap!this stitching is perfect!"
6124,Gabrielle,i don't. and i haven't for a very long time.
6436,Gabrielle,"hey, guys--"
6134,Gabrielle,i'm done talking.
6918,Gabrielle,so we're kind stuck.
7025,Gabrielle,you're right. i'm not happy.let's talk.all i'm saying is i just wanna know that i come first with you.sometimes i feel less like your wife than a possession.it's demeaning.it's--it's--why are you smiling right now?
7767,Gabrielle,what jug?
8365,Gabrielle,"yeah, i thought that was something we had in common."
5236,Gabrielle,what?
4388,Gabrielle,"oh, that is overstating it -- a little. the bottom line is, no matter how much i dislike you, i love carlos more. if carlos finds out about the money, he'll be devastated. i don't want to see him hurt. you don't have to believe i'm a good person, but at least believe i care about my husband."
5507,Gabrielle,it was supposed to be funny--a naughty little christmas gift for my boyfriend.
6349,Gabrielle,"yeah, she's a special girl."
7714,Gabrielle,why not? you'd be massaging rich people. they tip better and they tend to flake less.
4600,Gabrielle,"i haven't seen john in weeks. he's called and left messages, but i haven't returned any. it's over, i swear."
4484,Gabrielle,"it's just sex, it's totally harmless."
5555,Gabrielle,"oh, well, maybe you should go lie down.i'm gonna be out for a while."
5381,Gabrielle,you are a hypocrite. the money you spent to buy your sports car could buy a mud hut for every peasant in ecuador.
7943,Gabrielle,i don't know. make an excuse. say you ha some blind thing you have to go to.
5345,Gabrielle,"and a girl, aurora."
8563,Gabrielle,the newspaper? forget it.
7044,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. have you been there this whole time?"
8190,Gabrielle,"jean, you didn't just give in to it. you slapped a piece of cheese on it. yeah, i said it. now just fix the hem. and this time, try not to leave the edges frayed. hey, edie! wait up!"
6888,Gabrielle,"""yeah. listen, about that--"
5398,Gabrielle,i know what you said. i'm wondering why you said it.
7926,Gabrielle,says the man who massaged her into an orgasm.
8628,Gabrielle,"the first time a man did something stupid, and a woman pointed it out."
7933,Gabrielle,"the girls wanted to watch it, so we're kind of having a family movie night."
4193,Gabrielle,let go of me.
5934,Gabrielle,"carlos, you promised you'd come home today.well, i don't care what tanaka wants!rattling around this stupid house all by myself is not what i signed up for!no, no, no, don't hang up on me.i'm not done yelling at you!"
7435,Gabrielle,"wow. thanks for the vote of confidence. y-yes, the truth would have freaked me out, but i would have come around. if you had just had a little faith in me, i could have proven to you that i was up for the challenge, but you robbed me of that chance."
7801,Gabrielle,"i am tired of being a victim, andrew. and trust me, that is no bluff."
6758,Gabrielle,"okay--yeah. but guard them with your life. yeah, especially that one."
5696,Gabrielle,nope. latino.proud of it.
7065,Gabrielle,"well, don't get sappy on me. i won't stand for it. all right. susan, is the camera ready?"
6861,Gabrielle,that explains it.
5319,Gabrielle,shopping. not that it's any of your business.
5582,Gabrielle,"oh,hi.do you have to sit around all day?i mean,shouldn't you be out experiencing western civilization while you have the chance?what are you doing?"
6055,Gabrielle,"you can call it blackmail, carlos, but the court calls it ""spousal support"".so unless i get a check by monday, your shower buddies from jail will be throwing you a welcome back party."
7477,Gabrielle,what smell?
5795,Gabrielle,good for you.i love that spa.
6120,Gabrielle,get your hands off me! police brutality!
8560,Gabrielle,"oh, thank you. i'm not ill. i'm just not wearing any makeup."
4449,Gabrielle,"okay. you can stop condemning me with your eyes. right now. i know you know, about the affair. but you know nothing about my life. look, it's not even an issue anymore. john and i are finished."
6532,Gabrielle,no! you've paid women for--
4661,Gabrielle,"we know that you want to trust mike, but he had a dead woman's jewelry in his garage."
6826,Gabrielle,"yes, deeply."
5887,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei, what are you doing in our bed?"
5092,Gabrielle,"see, i was thinking i'd be writing the checks."
8291,Gabrielle,"i know. just keep reminding yourself that we're getting things out of it, too."
4951,Gabrielle,what? are you crazy? he would kill us both!
5110,Gabrielle,more than he knows.
7232,Gabrielle,you mean that?
5526,Gabrielle,"if you really loved me,i wouldn't have to ask!fine,forget it."
6017,Gabrielle,perfect.
6439,Gabrielle,oh. i had a great time. bye.
5143,Gabrielle,what?
6906,Gabrielle,get married together!
5960,Gabrielle,"you know, that's all i got."
4361,Gabrielle,are they having fun?
4417,Gabrielle,"no, no, you go home. i'll take care of this. and you were never here. go. go."
7059,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. it's just hospitals are hard for me.
4612,Gabrielle,why?
6288,Gabrielle,"don't call me a bi*ch, and stop tracking my cycle. i told you that freaks me out."
4281,Gabrielle,imagine what you would lose if carlos finds out you're trimming more than the hedges.why are all your friends staring at me? did you tell them about us?
4487,Gabrielle,"no, he doesn't adore me. he adores having me."
5045,Gabrielle,"isn't it bizarre that paul and mary alice had this secret all those years, and we didn't even know about it?"
7987,Gabrielle,that's it? no concussion?
4611,Gabrielle,"well, i heard that you're going full time with your gardening business. what happened to college?"
6490,Gabrielle,"for god sakes, zach! don't hijack a ferrari if you don't know how to drive!"
5876,Gabrielle,oh.
7393,Gabrielle,"the whole nine yards. i'm gonna go down to the cafeteria and get us a couple of ginger ales to toast our future. hey, doctor. he's looking better and better every day. keep up the good work."
4926,Gabrielle,"no, i know, susan. i don't know what i'm going to do."
6211,Gabrielle,what?! why would you do that?
8587,Gabrielle,we just bought you a bed. it's not even a year old.
7478,Gabrielle,"move it along, pops. we're gonna be here a while."
7932,Gabrielle,some animated thing.
4811,Gabrielle,oh that. mr steinberg?.
7108,Gabrielle,what do you mean by that?
6904,Gabrielle,"honey, you're gonna be okay. all right? we're gonna help each other through this."
6824,Gabrielle,yeah. i had to find out from her at my damn engagement party.
7575,Gabrielle,"we like you. if you have first and last months' rent, we'd like you even more."
6699,Gabrielle,i'd love to. although what am i gonna wear now?
6370,Gabrielle,"well, you know how the pageant starts with a big opening number? this year, all the contestants are gonna dance in pairs, and i've arranged for you to dance with your best friend amy!"
4370,Gabrielle,"no, lynette, i'm sorry, juanita's taking a bath. well, how much did she win from you? jeez,"" ""yeah, i guess she'll take a check. okay. all right. bye."
5853,Gabrielle,"well,uh,maybe just a little light dusting.nothing major."
4622,Gabrielle,"please, calm down!"
5273,Gabrielle,no.
4979,Gabrielle,so is susan coming?
7047,Gabrielle,wow.
5160,Gabrielle,i'll pay you six and i expect a conjugal visit tomorrow by noon.
6782,Gabrielle,"isn't he great? i know it's been quick, but he's just so amazing."
5155,Gabrielle,would those be the same instincts that picked out that cologne?
4624,Gabrielle,how? you're barely making minimum wage!
8096,Gabrielle,"carlos, be nice."
8443,Gabrielle,yeah. edie britt shamed you into being a better human being. that is embarrassing.
8195,Gabrielle,that's perfect. i'm trying to fit in an old dress. i need intense.
6887,Gabrielle,"oh, what, now you suddenly have the trademark on peach tulips?"
7558,Gabrielle,"well, i've got no solid evidence, and she's got a lease. so, bob, i was hoping you could ""solicit"" her services. that way i'll have proof."
4826,Gabrielle,"uh huh. i'll even give you an example. remember the time you were in jail and you told me about your secret compartment and you told me to burn the papers that i found in there. well, me being pretty and therefore stupid, i forgot."
4968,Gabrielle,"john! stop! shut the hell up! listen to me, you are never going to be the father of this baby. no matter what the paternity tests say, it is carlos' child."
6473,Gabrielle,please. kids don't watch videos anymore. everything's digital.
4132,Gabrielle,ralph has a little crush.so?
4199,Gabrielle,"oh yes, i heard that. uh, john, we need to talk about what happened the other day."
5276,Gabrielle,ah. how do i look?
5454,Gabrielle,nothing.
5363,Gabrielle,a new path?
5610,Gabrielle,"for some people,but we're talking about you now,mother."
4708,Gabrielle,who knows? it might even be fun.
4889,Gabrielle,sorry.
7875,Gabrielle,you know what's gonna tear me apart? another 10-pound baby shooting out my hoo-ha.
8075,Gabrielle,"so long, sucka."
4874,Gabrielle,"well, far be it for me- to stand in the way of a young man's dream."
4868,Gabrielle,"i'll figure something out. i'm sorry. i'm not much fun today, i'm going to go."
8213,Gabrielle,i said time-out!
5816,Gabrielle,so why do you want to be a dad?these are your glory days.a baby would ruin your life.
6140,Gabrielle,"oh, i think i do. phil, come meet my basically ex-husband--"
4905,Gabrielle,"what? wait? you think i'm pregnant? no, i'm not pregnant."
8682,Gabrielle,hey.
6102,Gabrielle,"no, that's how she got crabs. poor bunny. it's always something. if it's not the clap, it's a botched face-lift."
5587,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's nice.do you know what they do to people in china who speak out against the government?"
6652,Gabrielle,i don't know. he's just too arrogant. he acts like i'm some trophy he's already won. it's infuriating.
4633,Gabrielle,"yao lin? you missed a spot. no, spare me the lecture and just book me another job quick. carlos and i are up to our asses in bills and we can't pay them. fine. bye."
8342,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes. was it this--or was it this--"
6852,Gabrielle,"listen, buddy, you're not getting it. you answer to me now. i could have you fired."
6013,Gabrielle,i said it was a theory.
5494,Gabrielle,betty! matthew.
7383,Gabrielle,so i was shocked to hear about al. i can't remember the last time i was so devastated.
4845,Gabrielle,"no, you're not going to do anything."
6326,Gabrielle,"no, it's true. you have husbands and families and a reason to wake up in the morning. what do i have? him. teaching your kids about confidence and beauty is the most useful thing i've done since--i don't know when. and as much as i've helped them-- they've helped me so much more. so please, i need this. and i promise, no more talk about dodgy weight loss methods. like the highly effective, non-f.d.a. approved diet pill i can get from my friends in zurich--in bulk."
5262,Gabrielle,ralph! i need help getting dressed. get in here! now!
5492,Gabrielle,have you guys noticed how friendly betty's been since that body was found in front of her house?
7913,Gabrielle,lucky you.
6720,Gabrielle,aren't they all? so what should i do to make him jealous?
7223,Gabrielle,"well, it matters that you lied to me. i can't trust you."
8136,Gabrielle,if you wouldn't mind.
7532,Gabrielle,he called you? why didn't he ask me?
6927,Gabrielle,good.
8048,Gabrielle,"yeah, but it's just a thing. we don't care about things."
5180,Gabrielle,we would love to come.
4675,Gabrielle,have you seen our checking account lately? we're broke. and then we have the mortgage payment coming up. we have property taxes..
6125,Gabrielle,"no, if i wanted to hurt you, i would tell you about last weekend when i slept with john rowland."
5159,Gabrielle,"i'm not stuck, mr. bradley. believe it or not, i love my husband."
6283,Gabrielle,"yeah, me, too."
6896,Gabrielle,my flowers!
4444,Gabrielle,damn you!
6717,Gabrielle,fantastic. as good as with carlos.
4473,Gabrielle,oh! finally got the charity bug?
6776,Gabrielle,yep. she's on the top of a swiss alp and still managed to send a basket of muffins.
6010,Gabrielle,"well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind?"
6255,Gabrielle,"well, now that my divorce is final, i need a reason to wake up in the morning. i have this hole in my life that can't be filled by shopping. that's right, i said it."
6980,Gabrielle,"oh, my gosh, that's right. okay, you stay here. i'm gonna go grab him."
8340,Gabrielle,"okay, we're gonna figure this out for you. were her eyes open or shut?"
6832,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i'm just gonna say bye to my friend, then i'm gone."
4700,Gabrielle,i should probably go.
7594,Gabrielle,it's one of ellie's customers.
7276,Gabrielle,victor! victor!
6129,Gabrielle,"oh, right, right. you know, i may be living with you until the divorce is final, but it doesn't mean i have to put up with your cheesy come-ons."
4630,Gabrielle,"you know, i never thought i'd say this but i kind of feel sorry for paul."
7599,Gabrielle,and we're gonna make sure every woman in a 5-mile radius knows the kind of crap you pulled.
8306,Gabrielle,"i'm a friend of maria's, who, by the way, happens to be a warm and lovely person."
4420,Gabrielle,"you should go home and get some rest, eat something. you have a ton of messages from work--tanaka called; said it was urgent. carlos, i can stay here with your mother."
7922,Gabrielle,thank you.
7045,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. she doesn't want to talk about that."
6774,Gabrielle,"in a few months, i will be mrs.victor lang.."
7397,Gabrielle,"oh, that's good to know. uh, father, can i talk to you?"
4187,Gabrielle,i know you're a jerk.
6674,Gabrielle,you and i are gonna be so happy together.
8522,Gabrielle,"really? any favorites, tom?"
4161,Gabrielle,it's dark; you just can't see that the lawn has been mowed.
7888,Gabrielle,two whole months?
7656,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, we're never gonna have kids. shoes are my kids. let me be the mother i was meant to be."
7537,Gabrielle,"are you done with your armchair analysis, 3- divorce annie?"
8624,Gabrielle,"honey, you're 6 now, so i think it's time we had a little mother/daughter talk. your father's side of the family's trash. any questions?"
6118,Gabrielle,"whoa! whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't take sides! police officers aren't allowed to take sides.i pay your salary."
8170,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. what?
4746,Gabrielle,what's up?
7474,Gabrielle,where the hell have you been?
7294,Gabrielle,you don't?
8180,Gabrielle,mommy needs to lose a few pounds. you wanna help mommy be beautiful again?
8466,Gabrielle,"what the hell were you thinking, abandoning me at a singles bar?"
7241,Gabrielle,that's so romantic. i love that.
5049,Gabrielle,do you know how long it takes me to schlep out here to this hellhole?
5622,Gabrielle,"mother,no!"
8077,Gabrielle,"me, too. me first. remember bradley scott? i ran into him today, and he's giving you a job."
5497,Gabrielle,"oh,i'm sorry.i didn't know you and bonita were having problems."
5703,Gabrielle,"what?! why,i--that's discrimination.it's illegal.we could have her arrested."
4953,Gabrielle,alright. you win. wait right here.
5885,Gabrielle,"you're not a model, carlos. maintenance is my only skill."
4818,Gabrielle,"you know once you calm down, you're going to realise i did the right thing and when that happens, i'd appreciate an apology."
7022,Gabrielle,best wishes!
7587,Gabrielle,"carlos, i was a fashion model in the '90s. i know cocaine."
7536,Gabrielle,not that much. just his eyes.
4167,Gabrielle,come on.
4732,Gabrielle,you know what? i don't have time to fight right now. i have laundry to do.
4757,Gabrielle,"ah, thank you, yes."
6198,Gabrielle,it'll just take a second. please?
7866,Gabrielle,got a lot on my mind. i think i'm pregnant.
5077,Gabrielle,"uh, no. no. you, you seem to have everything you need."
5023,Gabrielle,"no, i'm pregnant, you jackass!"
5700,Gabrielle,why?i thought they always annoyedthe heck out of each other.
8310,Gabrielle,"okay, let's just take a deep breath here--let's not do anything we're gonna regret."
8610,Gabrielle,"uh, i don't know. there has to be some reason. you don't fall that far that fast without making some really stupid choices."
7285,Gabrielle,let them ask. no one knows we were on that boat. let's just play dumb and ride this thing out.
5669,Gabrielle,preston!the other one's name is preston.
6127,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing in my room?"
4904,Gabrielle,"yeah, why has it been going around?"
4783,Gabrielle,take the plea!
7188,Gabrielle,"boy, that was a close one, huh?"
4642,Gabrielle,you are so fired.
8691,Gabrielle,can we object to that?
6258,Gabrielle,"that's great! well, i have some fun news of my own. i'm ready to model again."
5167,Gabrielle,"carlos, are we gonna make it?"
6875,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! congratulations!"
7996,Gabrielle,"really? i mean, do you think i could pull this off?"
5252,Gabrielle,it is glorious. i have to have it.
6845,Gabrielle,my city. it's like i'm seeing it for the first time. everything looks different now that i'm first lady of fairview.
6952,Gabrielle,"honey, he's a multimillionaire. he runs my league."
7931,Gabrielle,"anyway, we're good. so have a nice night."
5442,Gabrielle,"the tuba, huh?"
4584,Gabrielle,"oh, really?"
8594,Gabrielle,"well, you should've thought about that before you started acting like such a diva. now sit down. father crowley!"
7443,Gabrielle,of course not. i use a spoon.
4275,Gabrielle,he's on his way over.
8231,Gabrielle,"boy, dinner without the kids--it's nice to eat without having macaroni thrown at you."
4577,Gabrielle,"you know, edie, i'd love to go, but, um, i just got back into modeling, you know, just for fun, and i have a gig tomorrow. i can't leave 'em hanging."
5621,Gabrielle,so?
7183,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't think we need to get into that."
5543,Gabrielle,the only promise i am making you is that this is so not over.
8303,Gabrielle,"well, maybe i am tired of being that kind of selfish bitch."
5455,Gabrielle,you make it sound like--i was making a pass at your husband.and that's just a little bit insulting.
7440,Gabrielle,"and in a surprise move, the spurs announced a trade that will send perennial all-star to the--"
8514,Gabrielle,was that patty rizzo?
7773,Gabrielle,wow. i'm sorry. i'll talk to her.
7230,Gabrielle,"victor, it's not that simple. we have major problems, and you never have time to talk about them, let alone fix 'em."
8579,Gabrielle,i tell you what. you can wear makeup the day you realize you don't really need it.
4150,Gabrielle,absolutely.
6895,Gabrielle,you don't mean that. that's just a big dramatic gesture.
6855,Gabrielle,no!
7799,Gabrielle,true. now here's a valuable lesson for you.
8544,Gabrielle,now march in there and wipe that stuff off!
7831,Gabrielle,"so apparently, after we had our little chat with juanita, she went straight to bethany and passed on the facts of life in excruciating detail."
4188,Gabrielle,"you know, carlos, i didn't marry you so i could have dinner by myself 6 nights a week. you know how bored i was today? i came this close to actually cleaning the house."
8417,Gabrielle,hi there.
7966,Gabrielle,virginia! why can't i stay mad at you?
7498,Gabrielle,"really? well, for a dog who's supposed to help us, she sounds kind of limited. sorry, but it's true."
5617,Gabrielle,don't be so suicidal.we can always adopt.
5113,Gabrielle,"yes, and i have to say she's old enough to be your mother. hell, she's old enough to be my mother."
8133,Gabrielle,"hey, you got an extra 15 minutes?"
4936,Gabrielle,that bitch! i can't believe her!
6932,Gabrielle,that must feel really great.
7893,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry about mr. banks. i'll take care of him."
6471,Gabrielle,this is adorable! you think maybe i could
7304,Gabrielle,"oh, i think you'll find this has a real kick."
8685,Gabrielle,"boy, with all this passion, isn't it too bad we're not having sex?"
7918,Gabrielle,"ooh, we'd love to."
5596,Gabrielle,"you like nice things? that's why i think you're stupid,for not wanting to stay here.you could be around my nice things all the time,taking care of them--how fun would that be?well,i'm sure it's a lot more fun than you'd have in that tiny,godforsaken village of yours.you know,we're probably more alike than people would guess.i'm from a small town, too.my folks had nothing.that's why i love america.anything is possible."
5857,Gabrielle,"""ruined""?"
7164,Gabrielle,h-hi. look at you. what a surprise.
6294,Gabrielle,vern? a moment.
5531,Gabrielle,she's okay.
6445,Gabrielle,nothing. just having you here helps.
4568,Gabrielle,"come on, honey, let's celebrate! sorry it's the cheap stuff. i had to economize. now that you're back, we can restock the wine cellar. let's toast."
7580,Gabrielle,she's amazing. i don't know where she gets all her energy.
7078,Gabrielle,state senator?
6433,Gabrielle,"i'll give you this--you're gonna be a tough act to follow, carlos."
4883,Gabrielle,uh??
8258,Gabrielle,who? him and maria or him and the blonde i saw him kissing yesterday?
5166,Gabrielle,obviously are.
5216,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, susan's home."
7103,Gabrielle,"oh, here. let me get that."
6362,Gabrielle,excuse me?
7671,Gabrielle,police! police! get in here now!
4674,Gabrielle,how? how are you handling it?
8675,Gabrielle,"i care about the message it sends to my little girls, and i'm starting to care a little bit about your tone."
8458,Gabrielle,"hmm. yes, i guess i am a little on the small side. that's the drawback to having ones that are real."
6581,Gabrielle,"ohhh, zach!"
4352,Gabrielle,"--i'm going to be exhausted at night--just like all the other wives -- till i build up my stamina, of course, but that might take a couple years--"
8285,Gabrielle,how about we let it ride? double or nothingmccluskey slugs someone by 5:00.
8063,Gabrielle,what?
4201,Gabrielle,"no, no, no, i'm not dumping you. lately, you're been the only thing keeping me going. it's just, we can't do it at my house anymore."
8459,Gabrielle,"oh, edie, come on. when you jump up and down, the room moves more than your boobs."
8169,Gabrielle,"playing poker, and i wasn't invited. i know. i get it. i just wanted to tell you guys i know i made a horrible first impression. now you know why models don't usually talk. because we say a lot of stupid, patronizing things that make people want to avoid us. what i should've said was--my husband's never home. i miss the city. i miss my life. i'm lonely all the time--and i could really use some friends. anyway, here."
5581,Gabrielle,"well, they should've called ahead."
7962,Gabrielle,"save your breath, carlos. there is no way we're letting grandma screw-loose back into our lives."
7764,Gabrielle,"guys, hey, knock it off back there. oh, god. what now?"
7147,Gabrielle,all quiet on the southern front.
4294,Gabrielle,"honey, trust me. when they're not staring at me, i notice."
6027,Gabrielle,"lynette scavo, i want to talk to you!"
4586,Gabrielle,"i wouldn't go too much farther, you're going to end up back in prison."
4797,Gabrielle,uh huh.
8585,Gabrielle,"you know, i should really get you tested."
6930,Gabrielle,"me, too. i think it would've been so much fun."
6109,Gabrielle,don't act like you didn't deserve that.
7934,Gabrielle,"gee, i don't know. i can't really see the screen anymore."
7463,Gabrielle,no! you started it. hang it up!
7279,Gabrielle,maybe they won't.
4668,Gabrielle,"that's very generous of you, but i don't think so."
8454,Gabrielle,all right. come on. let's go.
5491,Gabrielle,#name?
7069,Gabrielle,she slapped her kid?! no!
5940,Gabrielle,"well, good. i'm glad, because this can never happen again."
8496,Gabrielle,"oh, i'd kill for a margarita."
8225,Gabrielle,what the hell for?
5927,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei said the strangest thing to me when i told her you were dead.she said, please don't kill him.'"
8123,Gabrielle,"o-okay. i'm gonna put you on speaker, and i want you to rip 'em a new one."
8583,Gabrielle,"i mean, i know it was expensive, but you can't put a price tag on beauty. am i right?"
4452,Gabrielle,"well, let's say i don't die. i do yoga, i eat well. if i wait, does my repenting still count?"
6827,Gabrielle,"well, aren't you in love with edie?"
7233,Gabrielle,"for the last time, carlos, stop calling me."
5081,Gabrielle,there you go. i am so proud of you.
6645,Gabrielle,"you can chase me all you want, but trust me, i'm way too fast for you."
7356,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry carlos and i lied to you. i know we hurt you, and i wish it didn't happen the way it did, and i-i just want you to know that."
5646,Gabrielle,"oh,nothing,really.carlos and i are gonna go see the adoption counselor today."
4228,Gabrielle,says the prince as he rides off into the sunset. boy did the movies ever get that wrong.
8066,Gabrielle,"yeah, it sure is. i'll get you the want ads."
7321,Gabrielle,of course.
4527,Gabrielle,how am i supposed to live without a car?
5476,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna let you even the score.carlos,go have an affair."
5817,Gabrielle,but it's not even his.
4226,Gabrielle,awww.
6076,Gabrielle,what?
6944,Gabrielle,why not?
8353,Gabrielle,lucy blackburn? please tell me it's a coincidence that your new vp has the same name as your ex-girlfriend.
7203,Gabrielle,"sorry about that, victor. uh, anyway, it's over. uh, we both know it wasn't working. uh, good luck on everything, and you don't have to call me back. okay, bye-bye."
4270,Gabrielle,hi.
7701,Gabrielle,"it's a new game i invented, and you're winning 1 to nothing!"
4350,Gabrielle,"god, i'm gonna miss this, carlos."
7982,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
7331,Gabrielle,"look, we'll be back-- someday. we just have to wait till this all blows over."
4855,Gabrielle,why not?
4509,Gabrielle,i think--
5592,Gabrielle,"well, first of all,that was her idea.second of all,i can't have this conversation until you've tasted her crab puffs."
7948,Gabrielle,"well, she's a little busy with her friends right now, so just give it to me, and i'll make sure she gets it."
4673,Gabrielle,have you seen these? five more past due notices.
6012,Gabrielle,"oh my god, what are we going to do?"
7898,Gabrielle,"paying him a fortune. but he's worth it. i mean, what he's done for that woman, no one else has been able to do."
6626,Gabrielle,look what you did!
4885,Gabrielle,"well, sam, to tell the truth, i'm kind of in a relationship right now. i just wanted to be honest."
4591,Gabrielle,what?
5811,Gabrielle,"no, you listen!we were granted custody.if you want her,you talk to the judge."
7810,Gabrielle,bethany's mom hosts a weekly playdate. i'm trying to get juanita an invitation.
8080,Gabrielle,who cares? bradley's offering perks. what kind of perks is this blind thing offering?
8206,Gabrielle,it's hard.
5779,Gabrielle,"the baby won't stop crying, and i haven't slept for two days.will you please take lily for a while?"
7268,Gabrielle,"and tell them what, i knocked my husband overboard because he was coming after me with a sweater? no, come on. we gotta go back out there."
7446,Gabrielle,just eat them. carrots are good for your--just eat them.
7546,Gabrielle,"oh, no, i love cash. cash and i go way back. so are you okay with this, or do you need to grope her, too?"
8379,Gabrielle,"well, un-accept it. you have to take this job. it's essential that you be there."
4793,Gabrielle,i love you.
5532,Gabrielle,knock it off.
5897,Gabrielle,"oven, carlos. the oven.a well-cared-for,well-paid oven."
5680,Gabrielle,"carlos, come on!they're here!"
6637,Gabrielle,that's what you think.
4983,Gabrielle,susan's coming.
5063,Gabrielle,he's actually willing to take a check?
4950,Gabrielle,"no, nobody expects you to do the right thing."
4652,Gabrielle,"oh, right. oh, here. here you go. thank you. come again."
8670,Gabrielle,"okay, boys, thanks for your hard work, but maybe it's time to go home and take a shower--preferably a cold one."
4172,Gabrielle,do you think this is why she--?
7134,Gabrielle,"yeah, if i didn't, he would think something is going on. what is your excuse for doing it with edie?"
7177,Gabrielle,"john, what are you doing here?"
6639,Gabrielle,"victor, you are so full of crap."
7392,Gabrielle,"i'm so sorry, honey. i-i know this is bad, but we have each other. we'll get married again, and everything will be fine. for richer, for poorer, right?"
8239,Gabrielle,"you give it to me, and then call your insurance and say it was stolen? i didn't think so."
6130,Gabrielle,"what, you've been doing some thinking, and you realize that i'm your soul mate, and there's a vacancy in your heart only i can fill?"
6062,Gabrielle,she's right here. did you say something?
5550,Gabrielle,yeah-- yep.they're having sex.carlos confessed everything--right before he asked for an annulment.
4157,Gabrielle,absolutely not. you are much too young to smoke.
5503,Gabrielle,"baby,what you're about to see will most likely shock and upset you."
6587,Gabrielle,you've been here all night?
6208,Gabrielle,"yeah.yeah,i guess i am.why don't we just put all of this behind us and stay together?what do you say?"
5052,Gabrielle,"be careful, carlos. up until now, i've been really lonely in that big bed of ours, but when you're rude to me, it makes me wanna be not so lonely."
6376,Gabrielle,"well, friends come and go, but a crown is forever."
5870,Gabrielle,"no, no, xiao-mei,i've told you a million times.no red meat for mr. solis."
8299,Gabrielle,"fine. i'll tell you. i have been having an affair with a married man, and it's come to that point where i can't even look at myself in the mirror. so i want a new style that says i'm not a giant turd of sin."
7727,Gabrielle,"i got it all figured out. we duck inside, make sure we're seen by all the right people--except mrs. downing--and then after about 20 minutes, we cut out."
7349,Gabrielle,aah! edie!
6464,Gabrielle,"but you have to promise to stop buying me these expensive gifts. because i'm not that kind of girl. well, for that many karats, yes, i could be that kind of girl. um, i gotta go. i'll talk to you tomorrow! oh, how about that? and here i was, thinking some guy wants to murder me in my sleep."
7581,Gabrielle,"ellie, it's getting cold!"
4565,Gabrielle,"hi, honey. did the lawyer tell you the good news? you're gonna make bail. i found your passport."
7746,Gabrielle,"now it's official. i've lost everything. first our money, then my figure, now the last shreds of our social standing."
5525,Gabrielle,or maybe you just don't love me as much as you used to.
6427,Gabrielle,bill and i split up.
4556,Gabrielle,"uh, and it also has a lot of other exciting good, cool car things."
4994,Gabrielle,they're charging you with a hate crime?
4997,Gabrielle,"well, obviously."
6764,Gabrielle,that does it.
4823,Gabrielle,"well, that's too bad. cos i'm not signing that piece of paper."
5529,Gabrielle,now that's my guy.
7173,Gabrielle,because i want to feel pretty and feminine. ooh! my chili cheese fries! just a second!
7109,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. tell me. what's my reputation? am i smug and holier-than-thou? oh, no, wait. that's you."
7305,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't know, but if you're not feeling well, maybe we should put this off."
5785,Gabrielle,xiao-mei?
8313,Gabrielle,"yeah, she's a real gem."
8517,Gabrielle,"i was gonna say ""die of gonorrhea,"""
7170,Gabrielle,"oh, i plan to. good to see you."
7016,Gabrielle,yeah?prove it.
5957,Gabrielle,"i don't know what that meant, but i didn't like the tone.so just remember, am the boss of you, or else i'm gonna make this the worst nine months of your life."
4913,Gabrielle,you are out of toilet paper. bree i'll call you later.
8381,Gabrielle,"yeah. yes, and then i went home and ought, what a horrible thing to say to such a dear, dear friend who's probably really, really good at her job. so--i said, ""carlos, you have to hire lynette."""
7184,Gabrielle,"uh, does not ring a bell."
4334,Gabrielle,"no,no, i'll just be a minute."
5097,Gabrielle,"uh, our anniversary."
6078,Gabrielle,"uh, you--you're engaged? to who?!"
4841,Gabrielle,are your roommates here?
4182,Gabrielle,"hi honey, you're home early!"
8692,Gabrielle,"god, no!"
7753,Gabrielle,be glad you're blind.
4265,Gabrielle,use the side entrance.
4535,Gabrielle,"oh, i, i moved all our stuff, to keep it from the feds."
4382,Gabrielle,"well, how much did you have on you? it couldn't have been much."
7462,Gabrielle,like hell i am! give me that.
4349,Gabrielle,you like that?
6088,Gabrielle,"well, that's what i thought, but trust me, marriage is hard."
4464,Gabrielle,how's the dress fitting?
5844,Gabrielle,"bree,you heard what she said.i can't let this poor kid go back to china and become someone's slave."
6177,Gabrielle,so it's a job contract?
4858,Gabrielle,what am i supposed to do for money?
7403,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. we bumped into each other a few months ago, and we just fell in love all over again."
8279,Gabrielle,come on in.
7110,Gabrielle,bree saw you slap your daughter.
4995,Gabrielle,with our gay cable guy?
6869,Gabrielle,"no. i can't find a good flower girl. lynette keeps hinting for me to use penny. but i saw her in that preschool sing-along, and i am sorry, but we are talking zero charisma."
4629,Gabrielle,so paul said that zachary killed dana?
7916,Gabrielle,he's giving her orgasms?!
7832,Gabrielle,"she didn't wanna hear it not with bethany running around the house, screaming ""intercourse!"" at the top of her lungs."
7760,Gabrielle,"fine. okay, fine. knock off $200, and we'll give you cash."
7885,Gabrielle,"oh! you are the mrs. hildebrand. well, you're carlos' favorite client. well, mine, anyway. i bought this top with that crazy tip you gave him."
4375,Gabrielle,"she has a major weakness. honey, oh,"" ""it's okay. you were right to tell me this."
5451,Gabrielle,okay.
6523,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm stuffed. i can't believe you talked me into that crme brle."
5552,Gabrielle,who was that?
4553,Gabrielle,"this, um, buick thing. does it include lunch?"
6202,Gabrielle,"well, i'd do it myself, but i don't wanna get a snag."
7712,Gabrielle,"he's got a bum hip. he's also missing a testicle. carlos, how much more of this am i supposed to take?"
8323,Gabrielle,"well, that means a lot, coming from a united states marine."
4583,Gabrielle,"maybe. but having a baby, that, i can control. you, i can control."
6561,Gabrielle,"oh, well, um, luke's gonna be here in twenty minutes, and that kind of will be a date."
6465,Gabrielle,uh-huh.
7609,Gabrielle,"okay, first of all, you're a pig. second of all, don't say things like that. ellie's my friend."
6205,Gabrielle,i've decided i'd rather catch up with an old one.
7391,Gabrielle,"so when i finally came clean, his wife told me she shredded anything that had to do with offshore accounts. she was protecting al."
4165,Gabrielle,what happened to him?
7567,Gabrielle,"uh, he did the same thing to me. perv!"
6508,Gabrielle,i don't care. i'm not going out with zach young!
8331,Gabrielle,"well, what did he say?"
6015,Gabrielle,"she's got glaucoma. to her, you're nothing but a hispanic blur. let me fix your tie."
4166,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry about edie. she's a strong lady."
8588,Gabrielle,"then go move in with heather, 'cause i'm not getting you one."
7798,Gabrielle,"that's it? no compassion? no, ""hey, let's split the bill and call it even""?"
4692,Gabrielle,then why did you?
7526,Gabrielle,"she ran away. when i opened the door, she saw a squirrel, and she took off."
6610,Gabrielle,really? did he tell you that?
7713,Gabrielle,no! that's only part of the problem. have you checked our bank balance lately?
6529,Gabrielle,"yes, my lips, not my esophagus!"
6843,Gabrielle,keep talking.
5554,Gabrielle,"ah,vatican politics.what's wrong?"
5602,Gabrielle,shut up.
7605,Gabrielle,"oh, no, thanks. i gotta make sure my handyman gets his wiring done. he screwed it up the last time. you realize we could've had a fire?"
8577,Gabrielle,"honey, i know you think being pretty seems like the most important thing in the world right now, but believe me, it's not."
6979,Gabrielle,"i don't know and i don't care. today, i'm so filled with love, i can forgive anyone anything. oh, um, but if you do see them again, call security."
7952,Gabrielle,"this whole creepy, clingy ""i'm your grandma"" routine."
5405,Gabrielle,"sweet, little george williams."
7944,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa. we're not going to europe with grandma nutjob."
6500,Gabrielle,"i mean, i knew she had a shot at the top five, but to actually win?"
6580,Gabrielle,date's over. what do you want?
8441,Gabrielle,maybe it's a sign we're not supposed to do this today.
6213,Gabrielle,your terms?
4670,Gabrielle,"i'm flattered, but no, thank you."
4428,Gabrielle,"not really. they'll be able to determine the make and model of the car, but without any eye witnesses, no one seems very optimistic."
6779,Gabrielle,a poem?
8556,Gabrielle,"oh, fine. as long as you don't mind people thinking you're out on the town with your anemic lesbian sister."
7468,Gabrielle,come on. you've been cooped up in this house since you got home from the hospital. let's go out and have some fun!
4474,Gabrielle,"no, not really. you were always a giver."
7871,Gabrielle,"well, i'm gonna find out."
5202,Gabrielle,"carlos, he's kidding. tell him you're kidding."
7689,Gabrielle,"carlos, what's with all the cheese?"
8525,Gabrielle,"lynette was taking a shower and carlos came by to drive her to work. she slipped and fell, and he helped her."
6310,Gabrielle,i invited her to a party once.
6971,Gabrielle,why?
5389,Gabrielle,really?
4738,Gabrielle,sure. why?
7017,Gabrielle,"oh,my god,are you serious?"
5654,Gabrielle,"so,um,we're auditioning to be parents?"
4940,Gabrielle,i'm pregnant and it might be yours.
6446,Gabrielle,"because when he breaks in and starts hacking you up with his machete, your screams will wake me up, and then i'll be able to escape."
7054,Gabrielle,i can't wait.
4787,Gabrielle,whatcha doing?
4768,Gabrielle,"no, you see my husband and i still don't have a clear account as to how juanita passed."
6915,Gabrielle,"so after an hour of this, i suddenly heard myself say--"
5274,Gabrielle,"well, i'm not saying i'm not gonna grow attached to the little bugger. i just don't have the motherhood gene. i wish i did, but i don't. what?"
6814,Gabrielle,what are you two doing here?
7639,Gabrielle,okay. bye.
5755,Gabrielle,"do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?!huh?well,come on,then."
5891,Gabrielle,"yes, xiao-mei,that would be good."
5485,Gabrielle,"no, not really.does it matter?"
6311,Gabrielle,"well,honey,most models don't eat pizza. well, at least not without having a finger for dessert."
5360,Gabrielle,what is wrong with you? you are totally useless after sex.
6771,Gabrielle,"the only reason victor kept it from you was to protect me because he's the kind of man who puts a woman's honor before his own, and that's the kind of man you marry. that's the kind of man you vote for."
8358,Gabrielle,you can call me gaby. come on in! i'm on board.
6769,Gabrielle,i said yes. i would be thrilled to be mrs. victor lang.
5029,Gabrielle,she doesn't look that busy to me.
7719,Gabrielle,"i heard. i can't wait. ooh, i was gonna ask you should i wear the navy blue chanel or the red sleeveless dress?"
5165,Gabrielle,i'm ready whenever you-
6358,Gabrielle,nope.
5170,Gabrielle,are you hitting on me?
4200,Gabrielle,"no, no, he doesn't have a clue, god love him. it's just, i was thinking, that when you come over to garden, you might actually have to garden."
5541,Gabrielle,excuse me?
8140,Gabrielle,"well, i wouldn't have to if you would do it."
6309,Gabrielle,"honestly, it was like any other job, except the pay was great, the clothes were couture, and the parties were just this side of gomorrah. you don't know what gomorrah means, do you? good."
5539,Gabrielle,"because i can't say that i'm gonna wake up tomorrow and suddenly wanna do something that i swore my entire life.i would never do. ""maybe"" is a very big step for me."
4497,Gabrielle,you really do look fantastic.
4319,Gabrielle,maybe you're tired of me.
8689,Gabrielle,"forgive me,father, for i have sinned."
7244,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
7260,Gabrielle,"okay. i am so sorry. but in my defense, you were always gone, and you knew how needy i was when you married me."
5839,Gabrielle,"i don't have an appetite.in fact,this is all gonna go to waste.you guys should take something."
6162,Gabrielle,"well, then enlighten me. how can i hit you so hard that you will never recover?"
8076,Gabrielle,aren't they? daddy bought them for mommy - he doesn't know it yet - because he has a wonderful new job. he doesn't that yet either.
7299,Gabrielle,they don't know that someone else was us.
7592,Gabrielle,"so that's when i saw all those bricks of cocaine under her bed. i mean, i-i mean, i think it was cocaine, and i think they're called bricks. i'm just a simple housewife. i don't know what i'm saying."
4513,Gabrielle,i'm going to bed.
5349,Gabrielle,hello.
6209,Gabrielle,"well, what? what's so funny?"
6881,Gabrielle,"well, you canceled, and victor was kind of in a rush because he didn't think it'd look good for the mayor to be shacking up. and every day we tried, someone had a conflict. and then your date opened up, and we knew all my friends were available, and, well--you know, you, too."
8543,Gabrielle,"hello? oh, hi, principal hardy. what's up? she's wearing what?"
6251,Gabrielle,"oh, see that coat i'm wearing in this shot? that's genuine ocelot fur. although the photographer was the real animal, if you know what i'm saying-- which i hope you don't. and don't ever do drugs, okay?"
7905,Gabrielle,"hmm. well, when the time comes, an alibi would be nice."
6679,Gabrielle,thanks.
7869,Gabrielle,okay. but i'm gonna talk to bob.
5093,Gabrielle,"careful, carlos, you're not in a position to argue."
6116,Gabrielle,hello? there's an intruder breaking into my home. can you tell them to come armed? i think he's mexican.
5176,Gabrielle,"oh, david."
6103,Gabrielle,"i wouldn't. women always say they wanna know if their husband's cheating, and they always resent the person who tells them."
4741,Gabrielle,is that so?
5734,Gabrielle,"there is nothing to work out.if frank is not on board with this,it's over."
6011,Gabrielle,things i'll do for jewelry.
5890,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know.that's why i had the movers put it in here, where we sleep."
6437,Gabrielle,okay.
8184,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! that's great! oh, why didn't you tell me this when you were begging for sex this morning? you would've closed that deal, too. we're rich again! hallelujah!"
6312,Gabrielle,i know.i never did that.you would not believe the horrible things these girls did to stay skinny.
5488,Gabrielle,"see? i don't care.that's--just a waste of time--and spit.oh. okay.okay, okay, okay."
5194,Gabrielle,"david, we're not here to drink wine, okay? this is business. now you have to convince carlos that he can trust you."
5931,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know.it's just, she's been having pain-- down there.so if you could take a peek, it'd make me feel so much better."
6216,Gabrielle,"oh! hello? uh, there's been an accident. my husband--he--"
7716,Gabrielle,"bottom line, i miss our life. i miss shopping. all i have to look forward to is the occasional invitation to a fancy party. and i can't even afford a dress to go to it. carlos, please, i am begging you."
7263,Gabrielle,"well, i-i clubbed him and knocked him overboard."
6994,Gabrielle,okay.wait!aren't you gonna kiss the bride?
6257,Gabrielle,"you look amazing, younger than ever!"
5738,Gabrielle,"oh,bree could never have done that!"
4512,Gabrielle,i uh.
4233,Gabrielle,"mum, it's no big deal. carlos and i will drive in for the baptism. problem solved. hi, how was school?"
5396,Gabrielle,"oh, good. good. so it would really help our marriage if you just backed off for a while, okay?"
4446,Gabrielle,"listen, since you're here, there's something i've always wondered about. that whole thing about priests not being allowed to repeat what they hear in confessions, is that a hard rule, or just a general guideline?"
8505,Gabrielle,there's some seeds in this. knock yourself out.
7415,Gabrielle,"okay, padre. we're ready. let's take it from the top."
6727,Gabrielle,you're in love with me?
7702,Gabrielle,"18 to zero! 2 more points, and you'll break the record."
5695,Gabrielle,"oh, it's actually pronounced solis."
6488,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. i just can't.
7418,Gabrielle,"it's not a big deal. carlos is gonna get his sight back in three months. four, tops."
4587,Gabrielle,mmm.
4274,Gabrielle,see? socks. she uses them as rags.
6742,Gabrielle,"well, just so you're prepared, consider this my pre-refusal."
6028,Gabrielle,what were you thinking? i didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
7997,Gabrielle,you gonna start that crap again?
7765,Gabrielle,you sold me a lemon. that's what's up.
7883,Gabrielle,"i'm about to go get groceries. where are your tips? oh, my god! how did you get so much?"
4957,Gabrielle,"i'm going to freshen up, and i'll be right back."
7942,Gabrielle,"yeah, and that's why we're leaving."
4947,Gabrielle,i plan on getting really fat as a tribute to your mother.
5715,Gabrielle,"well,my husband and i can expose you to a lot of nice new things."
4435,Gabrielle,"i know, i've been watching. i came to talk to you."
7510,Gabrielle,no way. that mutt is not sleeping in our bed!
4311,Gabrielle,i'm getting something to drink. do you want something?
4139,Gabrielle,"what kind of problems could she have had? she was healthy, had a great home, a nice family. her life was? -"
5689,Gabrielle,"i don't care if it's a walk in the sewer.we are hemorrhaging money into your bank account,and i expect to see results."
7904,Gabrielle,where? where does she live?
4641,Gabrielle,excuse me?
6686,Gabrielle,could you help me with the clasp?
6749,Gabrielle,okay.
5179,Gabrielle,the what?
8194,Gabrielle,"no, not that story. something about a boot camp."
4590,Gabrielle,"you know honey, tonight's the last night of the boat show. we'll be able to spend some time together before that home and garden thing next week. carlos."
7578,Gabrielle,"no, seriously. we're getting along better. have you noticed that?"
8548,Gabrielle,"because i'm an adult. and besides, i hardly wear any."
8561,Gabrielle,gotta go.
8369,Gabrielle,"unbelievable. juanita, get your butt down here."
8109,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, girls. it's not like he's going off to war. he's gonna be back tomorrow."
5321,Gabrielle,uh-huh.
7791,Gabrielle,"for how hard life is. i mean, i have to admit, when you told me juanita was bullying m.j., my first thought was, thank god! let her do the pushing, just as long as she's not a victim."
6093,Gabrielle,"and it pains me to sell it. it's just that my lawyer told me what you're offering for spousal support, and i can't get by on that."
8504,Gabrielle,"edna, here's your diet soda. try to keep your pants on."
4460,Gabrielle,"""that must be a nice feeling.''"
7067,Gabrielle,oh. right. guess it's time for another one.
8220,Gabrielle,"oh, don't get all holier than thou, mona. i saw you pull into the doughnut shack yesterday."
7084,Gabrielle,"edie---she's wearing a big, honkin' engagement ring the size of a peach pit."
6113,Gabrielle,"hey, carlos. what's up?"
4315,Gabrielle,come on! i said i was sorry.
7146,Gabrielle,yep.
8646,Gabrielle,"yeah, and knowing aunt connie, she's waited all these years to call that favor in. she's probably dying on purpose."
7615,Gabrielle,"well, we needed some privacy. see, roy and i are lovers."
5282,Gabrielle,"well, allison's mad because she's losing jobs to fourteen-year-olds, holly is on a strict diet of cruciferous vegetables, and yasmin is undergoing a new embryonic facial treatment that probably causes short-term memory loss. you know, i just stood there the whole night trying to remember why we were ever friends. and i couldn't."
8339,Gabrielle,"susan, if you're not sure what she meant by it, why don't you just have a talk with her?"
6281,Gabrielle,"you know,just hours and hours of sitting around,looking pretty.but i think i'm done with modeling."
7907,Gabrielle,"fine. when the cops bust up this brothel, i'm gonna tell them you're the madame."
4949,Gabrielle,really? why?
5914,Gabrielle,"no, you don't understand.he's already dead.there was an accident.he's all over the highway."
5126,Gabrielle,"um, i've been thinking, you know, about, um, everything that happened with john, and, and, um, i was really selfish and stupid. and i'm sorry. i really am sorry. that's all i had to say, really."
5647,Gabrielle,she barely mentioned it.
8020,Gabrielle,first time you saw me on the runway.
6901,Gabrielle,"me, too, and i'm so sorry about that comment i made about mike. it was way out of line. you guys are gonna be insanely happy."
8027,Gabrielle,"uh, doctor, we are very grateful, so don't take this the wrong way, but--"
8414,Gabrielle,even if you're tired and get home late?
8564,Gabrielle,"seriously, we cannot allow this photograph. next time there's an epidemic, people are gonna think i'm patient zero."
4756,Gabrielle,"what? no, this is her daughter-in-law."
5119,Gabrielle,"yeah, like five minutes ago! haven't you ever heard of a mourning period?"
5425,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so sweet. i'm really gonna miss you."
5936,Gabrielle,what's so funny?
5588,Gabrielle,they put them in forced labor camps.isn't that awful?
7068,Gabrielle,um--sorry. victor needs me at this--political thing. damn. damn. damn.
6272,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry. is just, this outfit is hideous!"
5520,Gabrielle,"okay,go get him,tiger."
4135,Gabrielle,"i'm telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation."
5690,Gabrielle,"if i wanted to catch flies,all i would have to do is call up one of these girls.trust me, the flies would follow."
6215,Gabrielle,"oh, god!"
7761,Gabrielle,$100.00
4543,Gabrielle,"i'm not saying it's your fault, i'm just saying, fix it!"
7176,Gabrielle,"really? because his father-in-law goes hunting with victor --you know, the guy who hired someone to tail us and possibly kill us?"
8604,Gabrielle,"can you believe this? seven years ago, evelyn did fran's house. now? nohouse."
7912,Gabrielle,"no, but i just think we should end things before they get any weirder."
4234,Gabrielle,"you did. well, let's see what you've learned."
7413,Gabrielle,okay.
4943,Gabrielle,"um, carlos? your parents? john, something like this could ruin your life. that's why you have to keep quiet about our affair. there's no point in this catastrophe taking both of us down."
6544,Gabrielle,"a ""friend"" friend,not a girlfriend."
8687,Gabrielle,so let me get this straight. you play tennis. you know wine. and you speak mandarin. does every other man in the world want you dead?
4651,Gabrielle,no!
4204,Gabrielle,i'm glad i could help. education is very important.
4729,Gabrielle,because it's your fault.
6001,Gabrielle,"well, in that case, have some more fries."
5833,Gabrielle,"--which is crazy,'cause if you knew me,i don't do that.i don't do that.and--and my husband--my husband, he sings to her. he sings,so you can't take her away.it's too late. we've already fallen in love with her!"
5717,Gabrielle,really?just like that?
7427,Gabrielle,"i'm right here, babe."
7449,Gabrielle,"ooh, i say we nominate the woman who gives edie her bikini wax."
7544,Gabrielle,"you're right, ellie. my husband was totally inappropriate. so a class? are you a teacher?"
7239,Gabrielle,oh!
5682,Gabrielle,"okay. okay, look, we have to find another mother."
4820,Gabrielle,"no, i know what a post-nup is, what is it doing on my coffee table?"
4970,Gabrielle,"if you want what's best for the baby, you will help me. help me make sure this baby doesn't grow up poor like i did."
5120,Gabrielle,"oh, my god."
8660,Gabrielle,boyfriends? how many do you have?
7668,Gabrielle,"well ,not as dangerous as poverty!"
4478,Gabrielle,have you been thinking about me?
6149,Gabrielle,"uh, feng shui."
7992,Gabrielle,"i know. it's just--he's been through so much these past five years, and he's never complained. i just think he deserves to open his eyes to a wife who doesn't tuck her boobs into her pants."
5014,Gabrielle,"your honor, this whole mess is just a result of my loneliness. my marriage is a bit strained, and after carlos was convicted-"
4598,Gabrielle,"helen, uh, what are you doing here?"
6801,Gabrielle,"it's awkward! it's--it's like if i donated a dress to charity, and i went to a party, and you showed up wearing it."
6192,Gabrielle,"no! no, you're not! you're a great wife and a great mother. although-- don't you have children?"
5292,Gabrielle,thanks. thanks for understanding.
8674,Gabrielle,"ana, the whole point of chores is that you do them. you don't bat your eyes and call rent-a-horny-kid."
6323,Gabrielle,"okay,just give me a minute.i'm sorry about what i said to the girls,and it won't happen again."
4640,Gabrielle,anything to get you back on your knees scrubbing where you belong.
7252,Gabrielle,"no, that's impossible. he hasn't said a word. in fact, i've never seen him so sweet and attentive."
7850,Gabrielle,i don't care. you told me this couldn't happen. you said it was impossible!
4784,Gabrielle,"yeah! you did the crime, why should i have to pay the price? just suck it up, be a man, and do the time."
5341,Gabrielle,"not really, no."
5920,Gabrielle,hi there.
5865,Gabrielle,oh. and were you planning on setting her straight?
4849,Gabrielle,i'm not signing this.
5338,Gabrielle,"okay, that's ridiculous. besides, i don't feel what you think i'm feeling."
6295,Gabrielle,yes! what am i supposed to do with that petting zoo out there?
8518,Gabrielle,"all right, tom, you leave me no choice. you are no longer allowed to see patty."
7624,Gabrielle,wow. interesting.
8150,Gabrielle,not the jimmy choos. they're the only friends i've got.
6857,Gabrielle,"you know what that sound is, fat boy? the sound of your career circling the bowl. yeah, you're gonna find out what happens when you screw with the first lady of fairview!"
6955,Gabrielle,"well, the feeling wasn't mutual. you think i enjoyed sipping tea with these frumpy matrons who wore loud, polyblend pantsuits? you know how many times i just wanted to scream, ""vote for my husband, you color-blind cow!""?"""
7487,Gabrielle,you look very handsome.
5464,Gabrielle,hey!
5650,Gabrielle,"wow,did you smell the alcohol on her breath?"
8395,Gabrielle,will you still be my spy?
4747,Gabrielle,"oh, bree, i-i can't take that."
4515,Gabrielle,"just know that whatever happens, i love you very, very much!"
7236,Gabrielle,"oh, that's great. yeah, well, i-i gotta go, bree."
4903,Gabrielle,"i am so sorry, it just hit me out of nowhere. it is so weird, smells have been making me nauseous lately."
7149,Gabrielle,"playing with fire, almost getting burned but not quite."
5806,Gabrielle,"she's never too young to start accessorizing.besides, all the neighbors are out today,and i want them to see how happy we are and wish they were us."
8655,Gabrielle,"oh, well, not to push my luck, but i was thinking you could sweep the front porch and take care of the guest bathroom."
8173,Gabrielle,"and by ""we"" and ""food,"" you mean bree, right?"
4356,Gabrielle,"hi, john."
5472,Gabrielle,i'll tell you.your wife doesn't trust me around you because i had an affair with my teenage gardener.
6131,Gabrielle,it's over between us. just move on already. forget me.
4431,Gabrielle,it's a fairly recent development.
6043,Gabrielle,"because some marriages were built to last. and some aren't. trust me, i know the difference."
7643,Gabrielle,"name one, and keep in mind that ""aloof"" and ""unfun"" have already been taken."
4893,Gabrielle,"i don't need your credit cards, carlos. and i don't need your money. but if our marriage is going to work, i need your respect."
6351,Gabrielle,how was it?
5523,Gabrielle,"it doesn't work that way.okay,look,i'm really trying to understand your moral dilemma here,i am.but if you don't get my pictures back,i'm gonna be humiliated.you think our gardener is the only local pervsurfing the web?"
4852,Gabrielle,"well, you might want to try a motel, because you're not coming back in here."
8024,Gabrielle,that's it?
7174,Gabrielle,"uh, okay. you know that old friend i ran into in the lobby? it might have been john rowland. maybe. i'm not sure."
7436,Gabrielle,"good. to avoid future confusion, i love you, and i want to spend the rest of my life with you."
8177,Gabrielle,hey. you coming back in?
8406,Gabrielle,"i just can't get used to everyone working--first bree, then susan, now lynette. thank god for you. i just had to get out of that boring house."
6527,Gabrielle,"right, the kiss. sorry. i didn't mean to welsh on ya. all right. pucker up."
5272,Gabrielle,what?
4224,Gabrielle,we could all use a fun night.
8267,Gabrielle,how could we say no?
6152,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry.no offense,you're a nice guy.i'm just not into you that way.oh,god,phil! yes,yes,give it to me!"
4192,Gabrielle,"yeah, right."
6996,Gabrielle,"oh,my god! is she okay?"
7682,Gabrielle,"juanita, take off the dress! we're going."
6691,Gabrielle,you mean quit?
4923,Gabrielle,i don't know who the father is.
6375,Gabrielle,"she was so excited. well, she's your best friend. why don't you just tell her the truth? she'll understand."
7341,Gabrielle,"edie, you thief! open this door now!"
7892,Gabrielle,"carlos, don't even think about saying no to this!"
4140,Gabrielle,"no, if mary alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known. she lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes."
6612,Gabrielle,"little zach young? well, just how much would i have remembered?"
7229,Gabrielle,"well, i'm-- sort of leaving you."
5024,Gabrielle,do you have any idea what you've done? that little stunt you pulled yesterday in the courtroom could get carlos sent away for eight years!
8478,Gabrielle,"uh, i'm sure the school will understand if you need to miss a few days."
4567,Gabrielle,"hi, honey! welcome home!"
5685,Gabrielle,"with her dna,the only thing that kid's gonna be winning is best in show.look, carlos, i am sorry,but i want a pretty baby,so let's find another mother."
5009,Gabrielle,"yes, well, carlos, in some circles, beating people up at all is frowned upon."
4927,Gabrielle,i'll call 911.
7998,Gabrielle,"oh, boy! who knew healthy food could look so tasty? okay, dig in. what's wrong?"
7180,Gabrielle,awfully pregnant.
5563,Gabrielle,are you okay?
4397,Gabrielle,"well, i have a problem with you seeing other girls."
7812,Gabrielle,"wake up! playdates were invented by mothers for this exact purpose. shopping, sex, drinking in the afternoon--playdates make all these things possible."
8234,Gabrielle,beat it. what?
7243,Gabrielle,you're so blessed. makes me wanna have another one myself.
7491,Gabrielle,"if it for anyone but you, it wouldn't be worth it."
4467,Gabrielle,"believe me, it's been my pleasure. how's he doing?"
7539,Gabrielle,"well, you know--anyhow, uh, you have a great credit score."
7404,Gabrielle,"boy, you are just determined to make this awkward, aren't ya?"
4703,Gabrielle,"carlos, we can't afford to live here anymore."
5413,Gabrielle,there are going to be people dying in this church if you don't wipe that patronizing look off your face!
7389,Gabrielle,"oh, crap."
4184,Gabrielle,john?
5858,Gabrielle,wait.are you a virgin?
7664,Gabrielle,"carlos, are you almost ready? carlos? did you hear me?"
7325,Gabrielle,carlos and i are back together.
6762,Gabrielle,is there anything i can do?
8259,Gabrielle,yeah. and brad saw me. why do you think your bonus jumped from a stuffed chicken breast to 30 grand in a day?
5743,Gabrielle,we were supposed to have four weeks.she promised me the baby wasn't due for four more weeks.
8615,Gabrielle,"i didn't think so. you were always so classy. 20,40,60-- was it drugs?"
8091,Gabrielle,hahaha--aw.
4991,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos. whoever said you were the father?"
6536,Gabrielle,you play that pretty well.
7310,Gabrielle,"oh. well, you tell edie britt, just because carlos dumped her doesn't mean she has to go around trashing my reputation, especially when she's the slut."
8405,Gabrielle,"yeah, i've heard that before, and then tomorrow comes, and you're too tired."
7570,Gabrielle,look at it from my point of view. you're an attractive woman. guys are coming and going. i saw you take money from one of 'em. what am i supposed to think?
5353,Gabrielle,what?
4878,Gabrielle,because i'm in a lovely restaurant having a lovely meal that i now can't pay for!
5580,Gabrielle,"when he turns our house into a catholic underground railroad, yes!"
4854,Gabrielle,if you want back in this bed you know what to do.
6785,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetie. don't worry. you're gonna find someone soon. i just know it. what?"
4569,Gabrielle,what's that?
4136,Gabrielle,absolutely. wouldn't want them to think we're not happy.
8596,Gabrielle,fran schulman? fran. it's gabrielle solis from the tennis club.
5661,Gabrielle,"so we like to have fun. i mean,who doesn't understand that better than an unwed,knocked-up teenager?"
8166,Gabrielle,why would they want to talk about their lives? their lives are boring.
5384,Gabrielle,"okay, i think we should all just calm down a little bit!"
5854,Gabrielle,"no,xiao-mei,you don't have a choice.it's either this or go back to china."
5786,Gabrielle,"oh,no,xiao-mei,that's okay. that's okay. i know you were up all night with the baby,and i really appreciate it.you know,i'm very grateful for everything you've been doing for lily.so to thank you,i bought you a gift certificate to my spa.and you can take a whole day off and just really pamper yourself."
7438,Gabrielle,i'll work on it.
6143,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! that's right! that's right! you were up for the latino businessman of the year award that phil won."
5242,Gabrielle,"this, us, stolen moments, seeing each other whenever we can. carlos never needs to know."
8087,Gabrielle,"come on. you were with a plumber and a housepainter. i mean, let's face it - you like your service providers."
4875,Gabrielle,"what? oh, no. that's impossible. it's a new card, i just went shopping with it. try it again."
4257,Gabrielle,"that doesn't make any sense. i've seen her driver's licence, it does not say angela."
8032,Gabrielle,"oh, don't look at me that way. i did what i had to do."
6440,Gabrielle,hi. you're sleeping at my place tonight.
5662,Gabrielle,"well,then we'll just have to find someone who can do it for us."
5050,Gabrielle,"that's ridiculous. you're my husband. i love you. obviously, i would come visit."
4906,Gabrielle,"well, you assumed wrong."
5910,Gabrielle,that is so true.
6854,Gabrielle,free parking!
4929,Gabrielle,"oh, really?!"
5651,Gabrielle,oh.
4736,Gabrielle,i'm the one who stole it.
4576,Gabrielle,"yeah, but this is different. someone was actually murdered on our street."
8324,Gabrielle,"hello? maria. calm down. calm down. okay, we're coming over."
6646,Gabrielle,"i have noticed,and i'm throwing you back."
7099,Gabrielle,working out.
8462,Gabrielle,"well, it's one more than you got."
5873,Gabrielle,"honey, it's 100 bucks an ounce.that tends to make everyone a little nauseous."
8163,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sure it was kind of exciting for them to have a star their midst."
6531,Gabrielle,how much did you pay them to say that?
7542,Gabrielle,you're as blind as a fruit bat. how would you know if he's a bodybuilder?
4850,Gabrielle,"stop, you're hurting me."
4310,Gabrielle,"and for the record, i am not one of those women who has a hole in her heart that can only be filled by a baby. i like my life. a lot. it's very fulfilling."
7309,Gabrielle,carlos? that's crazy. where'd you hear that?
5995,Gabrielle,"you heard me. and i want the bedroom stereo,want the marble console and that painting of saint augustine."
5169,Gabrielle,"okay, enough chit chat. we only have thirty minutes left and i want to make the most of it."
7461,Gabrielle,"you know, the quicker i can run my errands, the faster i can get home to my husband, who needs me, because that's the kind of person i am. w-what are you doing?"
8336,Gabrielle,"we've moved on to my daughter, the thief."
6325,Gabrielle,"i don't think i'm better than you. hell, i envy you."
5797,Gabrielle,what?
7694,Gabrielle,juanita!
8320,Gabrielle,what you reading?
6866,Gabrielle,oh. that's what i was trying to tell you. the meter man--he grabbed my arm and twisted it.
7881,Gabrielle,"or--we use birth control, and i'm talking double-bagging, at least until we both decide it's a good idea."
6582,Gabrielle,you did not see the look on his face when i tried to kiss him. it's like he was sniffing expired milk.
7738,Gabrielle,that's mrs. downing. how am i gonna fix this?
7270,Gabrielle,"well, i came back for you, didn't i?"
6725,Gabrielle,"i've been taken for granted before, and i'm not gonna let it happen again. if i'm gonna give myself to you, you damn well better worship me!"
8410,Gabrielle,"well, i am so pissed at carlos. he is never home. and when he is, he's too tired to do anything. and by ""anything,"" i mean sex. are you uncomfortable?"
6426,Gabrielle,"well, you've won."
8207,Gabrielle,"shut up, mona. i'm puking air."
6029,Gabrielle,that's it! i take my invitation back! you are no longer welcome in my house!
6386,Gabrielle,carlos?
5530,Gabrielle,"if you're trying to come between me and my husband,i will take you down."
4463,Gabrielle,"hi, helen!"
7804,Gabrielle,"look at you, right on the cover!"
7062,Gabrielle,"i'm not finished. those last weeks, every day we thought we were gonna lose him. and every day, before i would go into his room, my mom would say, ""no tears"". daddy wants to see you smiling. if you're gonna cry, you can't go in"". so--on the last night--i sat there and i watched him die. his eyes were closed, but i thought he could still see me. so i kept smiling--all night. i was 5."
5234,Gabrielle,"look, i know the timing is bad."
8679,Gabrielle,just get here as fast as you can
8497,Gabrielle,"and she's the one i'd kill. i mean, really, who died and left her in charge?"
5387,Gabrielle,"i'm not here to talk you out of anything. check in this drawer. carlos, i wanna apologize for the way i've been acting. i mean, here you are trying to turn your life around, and all i can think about are my stupid jealousy issues."
4801,Gabrielle,"mr. hartley, i have a hypothetical question for you. i like to play the lottery and i - yes, i know what the odds are, but i just love those scratch-offs. say i were to win, i don't know, a million six hundred thousand dollars. would the government be able to take it? like they took everything else?"
5961,Gabrielle,you did not just to that!
5053,Gabrielle,why are all rich men jerks?
5971,Gabrielle,"oh, generous.that means he's good in the sack."
7194,Gabrielle,hey. what's going on?
4383,Gabrielle,"okay, well, how much did you charge?"
4548,Gabrielle,i'm still searching.
7402,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no, no. it's carlos."
6768,Gabrielle,"my name is gabrielle marquez, and i want you to know, right before those photos were taken, victor asked me to marry him."
6590,Gabrielle,please tell me that once contained a mint.
4390,Gabrielle,"mama juanita, i'm going to the store. do you need anything?"
7469,Gabrielle,"carlos, i see handicapped people out and about all the time. in fact, i met two feisty men in wheelchairs yesterday at the mall. they were living their lives--so it's time for you to live yours. come on. come on."
5254,Gabrielle,i know i haven't been to the store lately but i've been a little busy getting my husband out of jail.
4286,Gabrielle,yeah.
6533,Gabrielle,"uh, yes, it is. you just vacuumed my tonsils. i deserve to know where that mouth has been."
8318,Gabrielle,shayla? she has a hello kitty tip jar.
5500,Gabrielle,"uh,ralph,why are you telling me this?"
6730,Gabrielle,"well, aren't you clever?"
7718,Gabrielle,bree! what's up?
7555,Gabrielle,"oh, it sounds like he's leaving. i hope it's not 'cause of me. maybe i should go apologize."
4221,Gabrielle,"hi honey, you're home early."
8516,Gabrielle,"all right, look, tom, i'm sorry, but i got a responsibility here. i brought you into the club. i introduced you to the horny homemaker. i just don't want you to--"
4243,Gabrielle,"here you go. top of the line, free speed, aluminium frame, handlebar ribbons, and a bell. and you'll notice it's royal blue to match your pretty little eyes."
6352,Gabrielle,i know what you mean.
8526,Gabrielle,"so i assume you fully disclosed your little ""friendship"" with patty rizzo."
4468,Gabrielle,i hear he's dating danielle van de kamp?
8472,Gabrielle,you do realize there's medication designed to get rid of those voices?
7217,Gabrielle,which he did.
4679,Gabrielle,carlos--
6877,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry. i can't make it. i have plans that day."
6630,Gabrielle,"five? well, sure, i guess."
5994,Gabrielle,susan! we don't know that! all we have is some crazy woman's accusation.
8572,Gabrielle,that's 'cause i don't have any makeup!
7759,Gabrielle,i mean it. this is it.
7938,Gabrielle,"you're both stupid. stop it! um, mrs. hildebrand, this is really nice of you. but why would you want to ruin your beautiful room?"
4961,Gabrielle,"john, what are you doing?"
5711,Gabrielle,so is that what it's gonna take to change your mind--a gift?fine. what do you want?
8535,Gabrielle,"so when he didn't see me, i found someone who did."
6111,Gabrielle,"yeah, the cap was loose, and i know how your sick mind works."
8300,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's what i thought at first, and then i realized that's stupid. i mean, what about his poor wife?"
6636,Gabrielle,"well, a girl's gotta eat."
5949,Gabrielle,"no, no, no!don't turn it off."
8612,Gabrielle,"oh, relax. i already ate dinner at home--in my box under the bridge. fran? oh, god. i was afraid i wouldn't find you here."
4531,Gabrielle,"my china. i know how you've always loved it, and i thought you might want to borrow it for a while."
7495,Gabrielle,"okay, hypothetical situation - carlos and i are sitting on the couch. i'm doing my nails. he's whining for the remote. how do i get roxy to fetch it for him?"
5086,Gabrielle,"so, her boobs are fine. and, honestly, what he's doing to her self-esteem is just cruel. i feel sorry for her."
7195,Gabrielle,you serious?
5325,Gabrielle,"why is everyone on my back about this? i will deal with my loss my way, okay?"
4882,Gabrielle,return the shoes? i can't talk to you when you're being hysterical.
5076,Gabrielle,you're right. that was weird.
5515,Gabrielle,"well,i thought about what you said--about the pictures--and you're right.it was my mistake and i have to live with it."
6755,Gabrielle,that's for calling me a maid!
5390,Gabrielle,that's so sweet. i feel so close to you right now.
6302,Gabrielle,"have you guys ever seen a runway model without the hot clothes and makeup? well, trust me, they're not that special, but the one thing that they do have is attitude. you have to believe in yourself, and if not, pretend to believe in yourself, okay?"
6181,Gabrielle,"i know how carlos thinks. more importantly, what he thinks with."
6030,Gabrielle,no!
6898,Gabrielle,"just so you know, i changed all my flowers."
5336,Gabrielle,"you're kidding, right?"
7899,Gabrielle,"they both did. you should have seen the woman, looking at carlos, gushing like crazy."
5001,Gabrielle,with our gay cable guy?
7788,Gabrielle,but that's okay. mike's a great dad.
5639,Gabrielle,"i'm getting her luggage back to her,and that's the best i can do."
6543,Gabrielle,"wow. why don't you just hum it, okay?"
8347,Gabrielle,"well, i thought you did advertising."
4785,Gabrielle,am i? all i want is the same respect that you gave your dead mother.
5924,Gabrielle,"four months, and i've dressed like this for two of 'em. he's insatiable."
6817,Gabrielle,me? you two owe me an apology.
7645,Gabrielle,"mm--well, it would be easier if i knew what you knew."
5402,Gabrielle,"yeah,that's him."
5123,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. i almost left my husband for someone who calls me mrs. solis."
5065,Gabrielle,"you're a strong guy. you went to college on an athletic scholarship, for god sakes!"
7880,Gabrielle,of course i can't. it's just--how could you have lied to me?
4805,Gabrielle,because i don't want to have kids and you do.
6920,Gabrielle,"how? look i know i shouldn't have offered, but i did. i can't just take it back."
5847,Gabrielle,mmm hmm.
4773,Gabrielle,"oh, you can just toss that!"
6704,Gabrielle,"and every time you say that, eventually gets a little further away. stop begging, or i'm not going to your rally tomorrow."
6466,Gabrielle,ooh-kay.
4836,Gabrielle,i told you i'm not signing this.
5490,Gabrielle,so are we thinking this is paul?
8059,Gabrielle,you should know that watch is a knockoff. i sold the real one two years ago to get the roof fixed.
8440,Gabrielle,i got it.
6987,Gabrielle,what?
4758,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, carlos."
6171,Gabrielle,"uh, hold it. you're a sweaty mess."
7564,Gabrielle,"must he put his hand on his hip like that? butch up, for god sakes!"
7530,Gabrielle,"come on, you stupid mutt."
8388,Gabrielle,what do you mean by affectionate?
8667,Gabrielle,"all right, i'll see you inside."
4658,Gabrielle,"that's the difference between you and me, yao lin, our dreams. close your eyes, please. thank you. you see i dreamed of pulling myself up from nothing, and i did. i dreamed about the things i wanted and i got them all: a high powered career, a handsome husband, an extravagant house. so, this is just a blip in the radar for me, because now, i know what i'm capable of and if i did it once, i can do it again. i'm never really down, yao lin, even when it looks like i am. so, enjoy this moment, enjoy your dream, because for you, it doesn't get any better than this. there. don't you look beautiful."
6081,Gabrielle,"no, i'm not going anywhere. in fact, i wanna meet the blushing bride."
6121,Gabrielle,don't talk to me.
7196,Gabrielle,"so what are you suggesting, we stay with victor and edie?"
6219,Gabrielle,"oh, hon, again?"
7486,Gabrielle,"if it were anyone but you, it wouldn't be worth it. you ready to go to the party?"
8288,Gabrielle,"really, susan, there's not a woman in the world who doesn't know what ""i broke it dusting"" means."
4919,Gabrielle,"yeah, i just didn't realise how disgusting meat could be."
7432,Gabrielle,"""uh-oh"" is right, you blind bastard!"
4330,Gabrielle,"mama solis, how're you doing in there?"
4214,Gabrielle,"yes, i am having some new bushes planted outside, and he gave me that as a colour palette."
6242,Gabrielle,"i don't know what i'm capable of anymore. this divorce has turned me into this-- bitter, hateful person, and i don't like her."
7296,Gabrielle,"okay, this is no time for name-calling. a man is missing."
6040,Gabrielle,what?
5406,Gabrielle,"god, and he's our pharmacist. it's enough to turn you holistic."
6493,Gabrielle,you son of a bi*ch. you were there?
5953,Gabrielle,"i had a reason to. you were never here! i've been here, carlos.i have tried so hard to not be selfish and to put your needs above mine.i mean, for god sakes, look at me!i have agreed to be a mother for you!"
8125,Gabrielle,carlos? carlos!
6512,Gabrielle,how can you be so sure zach's gonna go along with this?
4253,Gabrielle,well since we're doing true confessions. carlos and i once broke a waterbed in cancun.
6169,Gabrielle,that's the thing.carlos doesn't fold. that son of a bitch is up to something.
6680,Gabrielle,"yeah, couture."
6787,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, edie. come on. it would make me happy to know who's making you happy."
8126,Gabrielle,"okay, girls. pick up your toys and put 'em in the basket before dinner."
7234,Gabrielle,and i told you it's over.
6393,Gabrielle,yeah?!
8218,Gabrielle,what the hell do you think you're doing?
8434,Gabrielle,i hate that we have to this.
8309,Gabrielle,i'm just trying to protect you here.
5243,Gabrielle,i thought this was what you wanted.
4492,Gabrielle,some work emergency. he wouldn't talk about it. sometimes i could just kill him.
5266,Gabrielle,oh! thank god.
6899,Gabrielle,the hell i don't. those peach tulips belong to you--and so do these.
7723,Gabrielle,what's happened to my life? we used to have help. now we are the help!
7451,Gabrielle,lynette!
4327,Gabrielle,i don't know. how do you usually manipulate rex?
6937,Gabrielle,are you out of your mind? i can't get married without my something new.
5850,Gabrielle,"so we thought,you need a baby in your belly,we need a surrogate--win-win-win."
6403,Gabrielle,to sabotage my new relationship.
8415,Gabrielle,huh. that's good to know. you're good at this girl talk thing.
5731,Gabrielle,"you know,that's your problem,carlos.remember when you bought your car? you paid sticker.nobody pays sticker!"
4763,Gabrielle,"well, it's awfully hard to like someone who actively hates your guts. she always thought you married beneath you and she let me know it."
6444,Gabrielle,"oh, and tell them what? 9-1-1, somebody broke in the house and left a six thousand dollar dress!"
6859,Gabrielle,"all right, look, i know you're mad, but wait till you hear what that jerk did to me--"
7614,Gabrielle,we weren't expecting you back so soon.
8201,Gabrielle,"whatever. i used to be a model, and you don't know what war is until you've been in a dressing room with a bunch of size zeroes reaching for the last rice cake. i am plenty tough."
8316,Gabrielle,you know what? you're right. i'm out.
7445,Gabrielle,"oh, please, carlos. i have a million errands to run, and i'd do it a lot faster without you. plus i'm having lunch with the girls first."
5337,Gabrielle,what's this for?
7123,Gabrielle,"honey, it's okay. you look cute in a scarf."
4618,Gabrielle,i'll talk to john tomorrow and give back the ring.
8484,Gabrielle,"well, edie once told me she lost her virginity in cow pasture. if we can find that exact field--"
6593,Gabrielle,no!
5130,Gabrielle,"but, i don't think i can wait that long."
8039,Gabrielle,what?
8022,Gabrielle,you know when i decided i wanna be with you forever?
8017,Gabrielle,"you know, carlos, i know you're really excited to see christmas decorations again, but--i just want you to be prepared because--well, some of those lights may have lost their luster."
8570,Gabrielle,"ugh. was it the ""chop chop"" thing? fine. i'm sorry. now can i borrow some blush?"
5249,Gabrielle,"fine, i'm pregnant. whee! now come on, we are supposed to be cheering up susan. this is a time of crisis and i think you need another scoop of mint chocolate chip."
6656,Gabrielle,no!
6614,Gabrielle,zach! how can you claim to care about me and lie to my face?
7787,Gabrielle,"well, what do you expect?"
4821,Gabrielle,"hmm, so the post-nup changes the terms of the pre-nup so that-"
7780,Gabrielle,really? 'cause it looked like you body-slammed my daughter.
6684,Gabrielle,"okay, let's be reasonable. you can't wear two dresses to one lunch. it's not like i have a spare in the car."
7649,Gabrielle,"oh! ellie, i don't know. what is it?"
7562,Gabrielle,target in place. we're a go.
6810,Gabrielle,"she will show you later! the point is, good friends share more than just gossip and brunch. they share enemies, too. so are you with me or not?"
7976,Gabrielle,"no, i want them to be close by. they could need me during the school day-- get sick or something."
7040,Gabrielle,or maybe a coffeepot or scented hangers or--a nice clock radio.
4693,Gabrielle,why?
6926,Gabrielle,hey!
4144,Gabrielle,i really hate the way you talk to me.
4209,Gabrielle,i can't believe she wormed her way in. how did you let her do that?
4520,Gabrielle,what?
5926,Gabrielle,you don't wanna have sex with me?you always wanna have sex with me.you wanted to have sex with me an hour after your hernia operation.
4508,Gabrielle,almost a year. but it's over now.
5208,Gabrielle,"honey, i know you're hurt but are you sure you're not gonna change your mind? i mean, there's no turning back after this."
4962,Gabrielle,stop it.
7632,Gabrielle,"i got news for you, carlos. you're blind. you don't have a choice anymore. you have to believe what i tell you. just like when i hand you the deodorant, you have to believe it's not oven cleaner. i know it's not fair. i know it gives me absolute power, but tough. you're screwed. deal with it! are we good?"
4495,Gabrielle,yes!
6766,Gabrielle,i am the woman in the photos!
4827,Gabrielle,worse. i read them.
7198,Gabrielle,"six months? nobody takes that long to heal anymore. it's a breakup, not a face-lift."
5946,Gabrielle,"so i'm gonna go shopping and then i'm gonna see my trainer, and i'll definitely be gone for, like, three hours.okay. well, i gotta go.have fun."
6137,Gabrielle,"does her pimp want the rest of the money? you know, there is some cash in my purse."
7803,Gabrielle,i prefer cash.
7923,Gabrielle,what? you heard the woman. she wants children's laughter. and i want the lobster the chef is serving for dinner. it's a win-win.
6632,Gabrielle,"i think i'd rather vote for the other guy--you know, the one who didn't wreck my car?"
6398,Gabrielle,you didn't?
7091,Gabrielle,i'll do it.
5917,Gabrielle,"well, carlos, they had your name."
6165,Gabrielle,but you're bringing me breakfast in bed or no deal.
6041,Gabrielle,"lynette, listen to me. you and tom will survive this."
5828,Gabrielle,so?!
6509,Gabrielle,you wouldn't even let your own daughter go out with him. you said he was a psycho.
8019,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's when you thought you were gonna be blind forever. but if this operation works, i just don't want you to be disappointed."
4518,Gabrielle,they took him away in handcuffs.
5021,Gabrielle,who ever said you were the father?
5919,Gabrielle,barefoot?
7343,Gabrielle,"oh, good. you're home."
4476,Gabrielle,so word on the street is you and danielle might break up.
6053,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's something."
7315,Gabrielle,how is he?
6941,Gabrielle,holy crap!
6460,Gabrielle,"yes, i-i may be in the top ten."
6685,Gabrielle,go ahead. yell all you want. you can't force me to take off this dress.
8171,Gabrielle,"actually, why don't you let me pay for it? it can still be from all of us."
8082,Gabrielle,"hi, bradley, it's gaby solis. i just talked to him, and he's intrigued. how would you like to come over for dinner and seal the deal?"
5122,Gabrielle,"oh, no, i am. yesterday, i was still fantasizing that it could work with you, that a one-bedroom apartment might be cozy."
7872,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry. he's a professional. he'll keep it confidential."
5874,Gabrielle,carlos! her boobs are none of your business.
4753,Gabrielle,put me down.
5875,Gabrielle,oh!
6592,Gabrielle,"oh, god. here it comes."
6002,Gabrielle,hey. you are supposed to be on bed rest!
8265,Gabrielle,"oh, whoa."
5780,Gabrielle,"oh,come on. i won't make you do windows tomorrow."
5187,Gabrielle,i'm not discussing this anymore. you can rot in here for all i care.
4396,Gabrielle,that sounds like a date.
4861,Gabrielle,i feel trapped.
7646,Gabrielle,"okay, when you yell at me, i get upset. and you know what i do when i get upset? i shop. so if we do end up homeless, guess whose fault it'll be."
4800,Gabrielle,"well, in that case, care away."
7335,Gabrielle,i can't deal with that right now. i'm packing.
6212,Gabrielle,you did this just to get me in bed?
7041,Gabrielle,"uh, wait, but don't go! i-i need a little more guidance!"
4908,Gabrielle,"and another thing, i don't want a four door. i want a sexy little convertible. and i want to buy one. right now."
8547,Gabrielle,"he's right, sweetie. you don't need all that gunk on your face."
4215,Gabrielle,"yes, it is."
6148,Gabrielle,"yoo-hoo! carlos! i'm making a snack for phil.do you want something to eat? some sour grapes, perhaps? maybe a little crow? okay, we need to move this over there."
8457,Gabrielle,"now, now, edie. don't be snarky. we're both hot, remember? although, apparently, i'm just a little bit hotter."
5121,Gabrielle,"no. oh, no, no. it's me. i am beyond stupid."
6024,Gabrielle,carlos!
6551,Gabrielle,"well, i think it's a regular. california kings are much longer. is your--wife particularly tall?"
8492,Gabrielle,"yeah, i just joined."
7571,Gabrielle,you do what?
5801,Gabrielle,"no! no,no,no.we're doing just fine.aren't we,lily?"
5172,Gabrielle,"well, that settles it. when this baby's born, i'll be in charge of putting on the socks."
6061,Gabrielle,yeah!
5399,Gabrielle,"well, i guess he should have thought of that before he married me."
5668,Gabrielle,"parker and,uh--porter,uh--and,uh--well,they're all p's.it is super cute."
8093,Gabrielle,excuse me.
8112,Gabrielle,and the best part is you get to spend a whole day with just mommy!
8232,Gabrielle,please. it was our pleasure. how did we do that again?
5925,Gabrielle,trying to have sex with you.
6773,Gabrielle,"in a few months, i will be mrs. victor lang."
5725,Gabrielle,"libby,you didn't tell us you had a boyfriend."
5578,Gabrielle,are you nuts?!
4469,Gabrielle,what's wrong?
7677,Gabrielle,my vera wang?!
8598,Gabrielle,so what are you doing here? are you volunteering?
7826,Gabrielle,relax. i told her i was fine.
6760,Gabrielle,"you know, you're a single guy. maybe people won't care."
4236,Gabrielle,hey! what's going on?
4137,Gabrielle,hi susan.
6037,Gabrielle,"oh for god's sake, what?"
6713,Gabrielle,"yeah, in the fridge."
5947,Gabrielle,but who has the ring?
4989,Gabrielle,i know. that's why i only packed one bag.
5967,Gabrielle,"tell it to my chinese friend, sue me!!"
6494,Gabrielle,i can't believe you followed me.
4494,Gabrielle,"edie, what did you do to that dress?"
4485,Gabrielle,this isn't about you.
6687,Gabrielle,"hey, victor. you're probably wondering why i've been in here so long. funny story. i ran into your ex-wife."
7705,Gabrielle,"carlos, our daughter sucked down half a sheet cake, and afterwards, no one could find the candles. wake up! we have got a problem!"
6957,Gabrielle,"yeah, i was trying to respect tradition--but i got horny."
7490,Gabrielle,"bree, what's up? i thought giving out this award was your thing."
6250,Gabrielle,"uh, way."
7661,Gabrielle,how about we split it 50-50?
7027,Gabrielle,how's next week?
8065,Gabrielle,"carlos, you don't just quit a job because of a few moles and a little back fat."
6060,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry.it's just that i'm waiting for carlos' lawyer to call.spousal support has gotten ugly. hello.oh hi, tom!"
8431,Gabrielle,"you're right, and i'm sorry. it's just--i'm scared. we're turning into what we used to be. i'm unhappy at home, you're always working, trying to buy me off with presents, too tired to make me feel loved. we've made these mistakes before, carlos. for god sakes, let's not make 'em again."
4687,Gabrielle,i am here to talk to your roommate.
6550,Gabrielle,hello.
6936,Gabrielle,"and, of course, it's the hottest day of the year. all the guests are out there sweating like pigs. god, at this rate, my reception's gonna look like the finish line of the boston marathon."
7786,Gabrielle,come on in.
7909,Gabrielle,"i know about--the big ""o."""
5240,Gabrielle,there are some ground rules first. i'm not leaving my husband. carlos is looking at spending eight years in jail because of my lapse of judgment with the gardener. i can't let him rot in there. i'd be filled with guilt.
7822,Gabrielle,"well, how long have you been standing there?"
8500,Gabrielle,how about the woman in the overalls?
7528,Gabrielle,"how dare you. i have looked from one end of town to the other, and i'm telling you, she's nowhere to be found. but since you love her so much, i'm gonna keep looking."
8407,Gabrielle,mostly gossip. you got any good gossip?
4227,Gabrielle,"no, you promise to be home every night this week."
8668,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. ana, the houses so clean."
4259,Gabrielle,can i say something? i'm glad paul's moving.
4505,Gabrielle,"no, it's okay, people didn't even notice."
6308,Gabrielle,"yeah, every day's a parade."
8044,Gabrielle,"oh, i told you."
5998,Gabrielle,there was a time you thought i belonged in your family. and you got over that!
4774,Gabrielle,"so, how much did that horse and buggy set us back?"
7038,Gabrielle,"edie! edie, wait! wait, wait, wait! don't go! don't go!"
4489,Gabrielle,"john, your timing is impeccable."
4810,Gabrielle,"oh, have we met?"
6156,Gabrielle,"really? oh, so are you, big boy! yes!"
5351,Gabrielle,he what?
7120,Gabrielle,"well, i bought you an expensive gift, and i'm not giving it to you unless there's a party with people who can see how generous i am."
4562,Gabrielle,"oh, uh, you know, i wanted to match the shoes to the dress. this is, uh, sarah, my shopping buddy. we like to hit the boutiques together."
7715,Gabrielle,"carlos, i don't need to spend lots of time with you. and frankly, the kids are on the fence."
5258,Gabrielle,"because i wear a double zero, you twerp!"
7758,Gabrielle,"andrew! unless you lower this price, we're walking--right now."
5852,Gabrielle,"okay,uh-- well--okay,it's like this--the three of us are making your famous szechuan dumplings,and i'm the dough,and carlos is the pork,and you're the oven."
6969,Gabrielle,why? what happened wasn't your fault.
8294,Gabrielle,or we can--make someone else do the right thing.
8368,Gabrielle,where did that come from?
7421,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no. this can't be true."
7375,Gabrielle,"i know, but edie was trying to steal the papers from me, and we got into this fight, and then the tornado just took them away."
6602,Gabrielle,"look, zach, i'm glad you're here. i've been wanting to talk about us."
5401,Gabrielle,"you listen to me, you little bitch. you do not want to start a war with me."
7395,Gabrielle,"no, we thought that you just might need someone to talk to."
5168,Gabrielle,"no. i'm talking about us. our relationship, our marriage. carlos, you're gonna be a father. when you get out of here, you're gonna need to get a job and make an honest living, for me and our child."
7121,Gabrielle,"and we can play games, like ""how big is mummy's tummy?"""
5238,Gabrielle,how dare you think that of me? i have been nothing but faithful to you! since you've been in here.
5136,Gabrielle,it wasn't a riot. it was more of a melee.
7311,Gabrielle,"boy, let me think. uh--mm--no. no, i haven't."
8640,Gabrielle,"well, you know--we're still gonna be family tomorrow, so i think we should think about it overnight and search our hearts, and try to figure out which one of your homes is best for ana."
6495,Gabrielle,"all right, off my porch."
7579,Gabrielle,"me, too. it's impossible to argue with her in the house. she makes us laugh. she takes you off my hands every once in a while."
8411,Gabrielle,"well, we've never had a drought like this. it's been almost two weeks."
5018,Gabrielle,"my point is that carlos is an angry, jealous neanderthal. but he's not a gay-basher."
7628,Gabrielle,excuse me?
4554,Gabrielle,ladies and gentlemen. i present to you the fabulous buick lacrosse.
4619,Gabrielle,"hey, bob! i get why she's so angry with me, but, what i don't get is, why you're so nice."
6585,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna take a little nap, okay?"
8215,Gabrielle,what?
8621,Gabrielle,"well, no, but--"
7365,Gabrielle,"well, i guess there's nothing disrespectful about a ballpark figure."
4389,Gabrielle,"fine, to heck with it. i'm not gonna risk my neck to protect you. i'm calling carlos."
8392,Gabrielle,"oh, were you, miss ""they offered me $100,000 a year""?"
5612,Gabrielle,really?what did you buy?
7900,Gabrielle,"why should i be jealous? the woman's, like, 60. if she gets off on carlos' magical touch, what do i care?"
8559,Gabrielle,i can't help it. i don't want people thinking i condone this face.
8451,Gabrielle,lynette's beautiful.
7699,Gabrielle,"hey, juanita. you wanna play a new game on the way home? winner gets a new doll."
7338,Gabrielle,"like what? ""rot in hell, you maggoty who*e""? that woman ruined our lives. if she had kept her mouth shut, we wouldn't be running away."
7138,Gabrielle,that's nurse gaby to you.
8141,Gabrielle,just for the first 15 minutes after you walk in the door. then it's carlos time.
8453,Gabrielle,too much?
4486,Gabrielle,whh--how can compare me to karl? it's not fair. you have no idea what my life is like.
4689,Gabrielle,"yes, i'm gonna tell him how you're trying to blackmail me into sleeping with you. i wonder how he'll react."
6634,Gabrielle,it would be your treat. i'm a hot date. what's in it for me?
5791,Gabrielle,xiao-mei?xiao-mei?i'm late to meet mrs. van de kamp.i'll be back in a little while.
7362,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i'm a mess-- you know, on the inside, where the mascara can't run."
7978,Gabrielle,"you know something? i like money. i like it a lot. a couple years ago, you could've bought me with that big fortune of yours. but i'm a mom now, and i make the decisions for my kids. and that is something that cannot be bought."
4626,Gabrielle,"i don't know. you know, every once in a while, even i want to do the right thing."
5848,Gabrielle,oh! okay.
5566,Gabrielle,"i wasn't, but i was thinking about it on the way over here.and i realized the ass i should be kicking is yours."
8131,Gabrielle,"well, unfortunately, they're not afraid of me."
7794,Gabrielle,maybe you're right.
7814,Gabrielle,"okay, i dropped off celia at preschool, and juanita's at her playdate. drop trou."
5286,Gabrielle,i like the sound of that. thanks.
6270,Gabrielle,"i do. aren't you a little worried that i'm gonna pull focus? i mean, it's a little confusing. people are gonna see tanya, and then they're gonna-- see that guy, and they're gonna wonder who i am."
8181,Gabrielle,i wish i had one.
4380,Gabrielle,"juanita, what's wrong?"
7219,Gabrielle,you embezzled $10 million?
4325,Gabrielle,"okay, this is getting really weird. i think we should go to the police."
6420,Gabrielle,"this is totally her fault. i mean, i simply asked her if carlos sent me the flowers, and she refused to show me the order slip."
7777,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, let's face it. m.j. could get beaten up by a kitten."
5535,Gabrielle,son of a bitch!
7370,Gabrielle,"well, they should give you something for the pain."
4207,Gabrielle,"it's just beautiful. i, uh, i gotta go."
7625,Gabrielle,"yeah, think about your son. people live up to the names they're given. if my parents hadn't named me ""gabrielle"", who knows if i'd be this pretty?"
8393,Gabrielle,"honey, i've played poker with you for the past nine years. i think i can tell when you're bluffing."
5585,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
7489,Gabrielle,"you and kathere did an amazing job. boy, we didn't think you guys could work together."
7316,Gabrielle,"of course! i-i bet he's pretty delirious. i mean, after his ordeal, i wouldn't be surprised if he's just babbling like a crazy person!"
6689,Gabrielle,"oh, cheese doodle."
4632,Gabrielle,"no, mikki, you're wrong. i wasn't acting like a diva. i left the boat show because that coordinator was making passes at me. it's not my fault."
4990,Gabrielle,"oh, your baby?"
4280,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
6606,Gabrielle,"you know, intimidate him. do the whole jealous, latin ex-husband thing you do. tell him if you can't have me, nobody can."
6537,Gabrielle,"i had a good time tonight, but i hated the way it ended."
7456,Gabrielle,"oh, hey there."
6802,Gabrielle,"look, edie, just find your own men and stop snapping up other people's castoffs!"
6925,Gabrielle,how about the bride?
4407,Gabrielle,john--john--
6982,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos. didn't know you were in here."
4770,Gabrielle,pretty sure?
7006,Gabrielle,"i'm not waiting for anything.oh,look,a moving van."
6706,Gabrielle,sorry. excuse me. excuse me. excuse me. sorry. i'm afraid mr. lang has to take an important meeting in his limo--now.
5352,Gabrielle,"no, of course not! he's a moron!"
8223,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, edie, it's a stupid exercise class. i tried it. it sucked. i don't want to do it anymore. lighten up."
7800,Gabrielle,"give me my money, or next time we're trading paint."
7332,Gabrielle,"i know. this is-- a lousy way to say good-bye. and i'm sorry, but i don't have a choice. do you guys have any idea how much i'm gonna miss you?"
7168,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah, so i married the mayor. kooky, huh?"
6775,Gabrielle,i don't know my own strength..
6719,Gabrielle,"no, i'm serious. our mothers had the right idea. they let men think they were the only ones who needed sex, and women just went along as a favor. men begged for every crumb, and we never lost the upper hand."
6039,Gabrielle,lynette! carlos will never be fair game! you know the rules!
6703,Gabrielle,"not tonight, thanks."
8678,Gabrielle,"you wanna see crazy? make one more statement like that, and i am throwing your ass out on the street. you care to test me?"
5171,Gabrielle,"no, it's his foot."
8591,Gabrielle,i don't have to get you anything. and stop acting like a spoiled brat. i am not spending a fortune on a bed you don't need.
7020,Gabrielle,that old battle-ax is gonna outlive us all!
8172,Gabrielle,i sort of do. now let's play some poker.
7769,Gabrielle,"or i could get the radiator fixed, which is gonna cost $300, which you are paying for."
7172,Gabrielle,just an old friend and his idiot wife. come on. let's go.
4638,Gabrielle,because i said so.
4540,Gabrielle,"she's a talented girl, our edie."
7601,Gabrielle,i'll try.
6222,Gabrielle,keep talking.
8416,Gabrielle,"yeah, i should get back."
5335,Gabrielle,what am i supposed to think? you lie about protecting me and then you lock me in that heap without door handles so i can't get out.
7441,Gabrielle,i did.
6174,Gabrielle,"uh, it's just that they're filthy, and i was gonna wash 'em for you."
4873,Gabrielle,i'll pay it off.
5881,Gabrielle,"oh, well,i'm sorry to hear that.so, uh, did you move my beauty products?they're not in the bathroom."
6354,Gabrielle,you always do the chips!
4414,Gabrielle,okay. take good care of carlos.
4941,Gabrielle,"we don't even know for sure if i'ts yours, so relax. okay, and i didn't come here to watch you freak out."
7999,Gabrielle,it's a recipe i got from a diet magazine. it's--it's fish and broccoli.
4422,Gabrielle,don't say that! we need to stay positive.
5189,Gabrielle,no!
7346,Gabrielle,give me my money!
8129,Gabrielle,fine.
7552,Gabrielle,"okay, that was weird."
5540,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry, but you're just gonna have to accept it.there's nothing else you can do."
6959,Gabrielle,polling data? why are you polling? the election's over.
8247,Gabrielle,"you're right. i'm sorry. it's just--i really wanted to buy this bracelet i saw today downtown in this little jewelry shop. you know the place, honey. it's right next to the, lexington hotel."
7003,Gabrielle,i still have a lot of stuff here.
5074,Gabrielle,excuse me?
4289,Gabrielle,no.
7757,Gabrielle,"well, i'll tell you what. since your mom and i are dear friends, i'll take it off your hands if you knock off $ 300."
8631,Gabrielle,"wow, this place is looking worse than ever."
7806,Gabrielle,you have a marketing plan. you wanna see my marketing plan?
8043,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. that's wonderful!"
7052,Gabrielle,"oh, that's sweet. but to be honest, i don't like hospitals."
7459,Gabrielle,"and how is he gonna park a car if he can't see? feeling pretty stupid now, aren't ya?"
4251,Gabrielle,"yeah, that thought did cross my mind."
6649,Gabrielle,"been there, done that."
6458,Gabrielle,"look, i know you're trying to be romantic, but if you keep this up, i'm gonna be forced--"
5002,Gabrielle,hello?
5561,Gabrielle,there.i think we're all done here.
7807,Gabrielle,"honey, she's only been here 20 minutes. we invited her over to play, so go play."
5667,Gabrielle,mm-hmm. yes.
7139,Gabrielle,"well, the doctor says you need to relax, and i know just how to relax you."
6753,Gabrielle,"i want all the negatives of those photos, or i start breaking fingers!"
4154,Gabrielle,turns out i wanted all the wrong things.
8396,Gabrielle,i talked to carlos. you're in!
4536,Gabrielle,it's not your fault. you didn't do anything wrong. i'll take care of everything until you're back to do it yourself. and you will be soon.
7521,Gabrielle,"well, sorry it didn't work out. i gotta run."
6569,Gabrielle,"uh, go ahead. i'm gonna open some more wine."
6291,Gabrielle,"fine. i'll do it, but i want this dress for free."
7603,Gabrielle,oh.
7185,Gabrielle,"yeah, good times. anyways, uh, that's a negatory on the affair--"
7540,Gabrielle,what was what?
7847,Gabrielle,"uh, well, mommy has a friend who visits her every month, and she's late, and that's bad."
7612,Gabrielle,"no, he's at braille school."
6447,Gabrielle,all right. don't take the big one. that's my favorite.
8079,Gabrielle,oh. great. and what's the signing bonus for that-a cup of pencils? i thought you were gonna get a better job. what happened to the world being your oyster?
8425,Gabrielle,"carlos, where you going?"
5643,Gabrielle,seriously?but i thought you wanted a kid with your own dna?
6472,Gabrielle,fine. why does julie have a vcr?
5560,Gabrielle,ah! oh.that was a mistake.
8366,Gabrielle,"hey, are you still looking for a marketing director? i have a friend that i would love to see working with you two."
7805,Gabrielle,"no, it's horrible! she's gonna become this famous author and have no time at all for us."
5428,Gabrielle,what happened to sister greta?
7409,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. i wanted it to be a surprise, but we're getting married! father, hit it."
6564,Gabrielle,don't get too full. you have to leave room for dessert.
5499,Gabrielle,ralph!make your point.
4245,Gabrielle,"what? well, then why did you ask for one?"
4482,Gabrielle,"oh, that! uh-- he was helping me adjust the seam in my stocking, and from your angle, it must have looked a little weird."
6289,Gabrielle,the divorce decree came through today. carlos is officially out of my life.
6554,Gabrielle,it was a--shameless sex joke. i was flirting with you.
8034,Gabrielle,"i don't know. some italian guy. hey, mike's into baseball. he must know someone who can track down this lou gehrig guy and get him to sign a new one. what?"
4888,Gabrielle,aren't they gorgeous?
7431,Gabrielle,"i'll tell you what's going on. ""in three months. four, tops."""
6094,Gabrielle,"so i should be punished? attention, shoppers, for the next minutes, free golf club with every purchase!"
4306,Gabrielle,what's your point?
5291,Gabrielle,that sounds so nice. it's just i'm booked solid today. my head's gonna explode. can i take a rain check?
6018,Gabrielle,what would make you think i would have even consider taking you back?
6629,Gabrielle,"well, good. i'm glad you like it, 'cause you're gonna pay to fix this."
8657,Gabrielle,"""all right""? young lady, if you live under my roof, you will not disparage versace."
6577,Gabrielle,of course you are!
4659,Gabrielle,"john, you're a toy.you and me -- no future."
8349,Gabrielle,"look, lynette, you're my friend, and i love you, but as far as knowing if you're any good at your job--"
8606,Gabrielle,remember that dinner party she gave? she had 20 place settings of tiffany china. how does this happen to someone who has tiffany china?
4778,Gabrielle,what is that?
4322,Gabrielle,tomorrow. meet me at the front entrance of the mall after school.
5385,Gabrielle,carlos!
6718,Gabrielle,"god, i'm such an idiot. i gave it up way too fast. now i've lost all the power."
7274,Gabrielle,"what, are you crazy?!"
6780,Gabrielle,what are you waiting for? get the champagne.
5271,Gabrielle,"bree, my friends are models. they're never happy for anyone."
4606,Gabrielle,i'll see what i can do.
5422,Gabrielle,sister mary was going on the trip?
6313,Gabrielle,"well, some would smoke those unfiltered french cigarettes."
7167,Gabrielle,that's right. you're a hotel heiress.
4798,Gabrielle,apparently.
6032,Gabrielle,no!
6916,Gabrielle,wanted to bite my tongue the minute it came out.
7106,Gabrielle,what? i spilled my drink on him.
8100,Gabrielle,so--is eye care included in the health plan? 'cause that's obviously a big issue for carlos.
7554,Gabrielle,"that was for the ""useless"" comment, wasn't it?"
4423,Gabrielle,john!
6462,Gabrielle,i would not feel comfortable meeting for dinner.
7584,Gabrielle,you guys going for another walk?
8421,Gabrielle,not my problem.
4702,Gabrielle,definitely gay.
5893,Gabrielle,ow! stop kicking me.
8528,Gabrielle,"hey, don't snap at me. lynette's my friend. i was just watching her back."
8350,Gabrielle,"you're putting me in a tough spot. carlos is under a lot of pressure now, and he's not really in a position to be taking big risks."
7970,Gabrielle,"no, uh, what i remember was you asking me to the movies tonight, and me saying i couldn't because i was going to watch carlos' band play. you got invitation out of that?"
6008,Gabrielle,here.
5992,Gabrielle,"yes, it would look perfect."
8658,Gabrielle,"no, i'm just kidding. it was a joke."
6292,Gabrielle,"and i hate helping others, too, but i'm doing that, aren't i?"
8374,Gabrielle,that's it. party's over!
7855,Gabrielle,"well, i guess that's not the worst idea you've ever had. but it's not just about the money, carlos. it's-- oh, after my miscarriage, i gave up on this dream. i just figured god decided i couldn't possibly be a good mom, so he didn't make it happen."
8524,Gabrielle,us?
4834,Gabrielle,"oh honey, nobody's blaming you."
6365,Gabrielle,what?
8185,Gabrielle,"honey, we're gonna be us again--the old carlos and gaby. you know what? i'm gonna wear my dress from the night you proposed."
4969,Gabrielle,"because carlos can provide, john! he can give this baby everything. piano lessons and summer camp and the best colleges. he can raise this child the way it deserves to be raised, you can't."
5671,Gabrielle,will you shut up?
7137,Gabrielle,yeah.
7465,Gabrielle,"jeez. what, is there a telethon going on around here?"
7175,Gabrielle,"but just to be safe, you may wanna hide in the closet."
5966,Gabrielle,"i can't wait for you to pop out that baby because when you do i am putting you on the first plane back to shanghai, and you're going to be on all fours in a rice patty before the epidural wears off!"
5295,Gabrielle,"yeah, you know, i would, but the store has this strict thirty-day return policy."
4285,Gabrielle,we had no idea.
8476,Gabrielle,pfft.
8191,Gabrielle,"now don't forget, the clasp is broken."
8446,Gabrielle,this is gonna be fun. i can't believe we've never gone out on the town together.
4646,Gabrielle,people keep coming and talking to me asking me questions. that is not my job.
4672,Gabrielle,he has a lot of anger toward the government right now and he's just dying to find someone to take it out on.
6234,Gabrielle,"carlos, have you lost your mind?!"
5078,Gabrielle,so are you gonna do it?
6999,Gabrielle,"okay,you know,running away with you on my wedding night was crazy enough.but runnin' away to be alone is insane!"
6722,Gabrielle,"yes, it was."
5495,Gabrielle,count me in.
8427,Gabrielle,juanita! celia! get your coats on! we're going to see daddy.
5813,Gabrielle,like hell!
8586,Gabrielle,did you have a fun playdate with heather?
5056,Gabrielle,why?
7884,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing home?"
5400,Gabrielle,"what the hell kind of nun are you? look, if you try to come between me and my husband, i will take you down."
7152,Gabrielle,ooh.
7859,Gabrielle,"yeah, we're up to two miracles, and if you come back from the dead after i kill you, it'll be three."
4625,Gabrielle,i've tried poor but happy. guess what. it wasn't that happy.
7107,Gabrielle,"look, lady, you need to calm down. you're getting a reputation around here for having a stick up your ass."
6836,Gabrielle,"oh, give me a break. i was standing right there. you could've said something."
6114,Gabrielle,that's probably because i had the locks changed.
4218,Gabrielle,"god, it's beautiful!"
5778,Gabrielle,"psst,xiao-mei.psst,wake up."
7586,Gabrielle,"what the hell? ellie, your door is locked! ellie! oh, shut up already."
7079,Gabrielle,"oh, that's right. i was reading about that in politics is boring magazine."
6539,Gabrielle,so stop doing it. stop buying people.
4723,Gabrielle,"obviously, someone who's not getting it at home."
6286,Gabrielle,"you're opening up a salon? god, could you get any gayer?"
7371,Gabrielle,"tragic. i found out everything victor had is in milton's name, and he told his father about us, so i'm not getting a penny."
6850,Gabrielle,thank you. now what you're about to see may astound you.
7929,Gabrielle,"no, we're good."
6588,Gabrielle,right after what?
6736,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, that's amazing! what are you doing?"
4185,Gabrielle,"he's still mourning, susan, he'll probably freak out."
8106,Gabrielle,"absolutely. come here, you!"
8412,Gabrielle,"yeah. lately, carlos just doesn't want to do it."
5942,Gabrielle,oh. i seriously doubt that.
4141,Gabrielle,you can't order me around like i'm a child!
4824,Gabrielle,"so what do you expect to happen right now, carlos? i sign the papers and jump into your arms."
5951,Gabrielle,good.i have a little project for you.
5362,Gabrielle,so pretty much just you.
7190,Gabrielle,you deserved it. all you cared about back then was work.
6702,Gabrielle,i had such a good time tonight. who knew you could dance?
6065,Gabrielle,"what is this, freakin' noah's ark?!"
6846,Gabrielle,"well, well, well. who do we have here?"
5377,Gabrielle,"oh, i get it. sort of like, today's convict is tomorrow's convert."
5641,Gabrielle,ah.
6815,Gabrielle,i don't believe it. this is an absolute betrayal of our friendship.
4680,Gabrielle,"justin, what are you doing up here?"
7262,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, thank god you're here."
8635,Gabrielle,let me see your palms.
4984,Gabrielle,"i just want to say goodbye, because i'm leaving you."
7127,Gabrielle,"interesting. question--when was the last time you were in the bar and heard a guy turn to his friend and say, ""hey, check out the soul on that girl""?"
8520,Gabrielle,"look, i love you, tom, but you're my friend with a small ""f."" my friend with the big ""f"" is lynette. so if i see something that could hurt her, you bet your ass i'm gonna do something about it."
4709,Gabrielle,bigger.
4737,Gabrielle,"thank you so much, bree. seeing your tile has really helped me make my decision. next time i remodel, i am using limestone."
7903,Gabrielle,"oh, i bet he does! where is he? is she here now?"
5410,Gabrielle,"not god, my husband."
5618,Gabrielle,what does it matter whose dna it is?the diapers are still gonna smell the same regardless.
7956,Gabrielle,back off!
4503,Gabrielle,"susan, don't be like this!"
8449,Gabrielle,"oh, be nice! there are lots of attractive women on the street."
8147,Gabrielle,don't leave me here. i'm going out of my mind. everyone is so boring and suburban. and how many freakin' honor students n that school have?
5324,Gabrielle,"yeah, so?"
6697,Gabrielle,"i've known you for two weeks, and this is the first glimpse of a guy i could actually like."
8127,Gabrielle,i've had enough of your crap. now pick up these toys!
6808,Gabrielle,"really? because i wasn't very comfortable taking your side when you were feuding with patty monroe over the backyard fence line, but i did."
7848,Gabrielle,because she's the one who assures me that you won't get a baby brother or sister.
6329,Gabrielle,"yes, i'm unbelievable.close your mouths."
5106,Gabrielle,"no, he really did."
8481,Gabrielle,"we, uh--also came to give you your mom's ashes."
4877,Gabrielle,it's me.
5181,Gabrielle,shaky at best.
7455,Gabrielle,"no, i think you have to have a wheelchair to get one of those."
7691,Gabrielle,"ha! we can only hope, with your dna running through her veins."
8333,Gabrielle,he sure will. the man has a plane to catch.
5536,Gabrielle,sure.
5756,Gabrielle,hurry up!
7433,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i think it was a fantastic plan. i mean, there's no way i ever would have figured out that i was married to a permanently blind guy!"
6327,Gabrielle,"well, why don't you ladies talk it over? and i'm gonna work on posture with the girls."
5963,Gabrielle,"oh, cut it out, xiao mei.the doctor didn't say anything about me rubbing your chubby stumps.rub'em yourself."
4441,Gabrielle,what?
4237,Gabrielle,"oh, oh, no problem. nice to meet you, ashley."
6756,Gabrielle,"that miserable cockroach. well, if you wanna smack him around a little, i can go inside and turn up the radio."
7483,Gabrielle,"that's not the point, you blind idiot! i'm saying if all i get in exchange for this crappy situation is a nice parking spot for my $8 manicure, then i'm taking it!"
6763,Gabrielle,"it's not going very well, is it?"
5645,Gabrielle,"oh,my god!"
7281,Gabrielle,then maybe the boat needs to go back out--alone.
5584,Gabrielle,did you make all of this?oh!for me? okay.
4134,Gabrielle,"there's no way i can just work that in, carlos."
4935,Gabrielle,"yeah, so?"
6173,Gabrielle,"uh, why did you put those shorts back on?"
7410,Gabrielle,"i don't know. just after everything we've been through, there's nothing in our way now. we can finally be together. and i really need that. i need a happy ending, carlos. so what do you say? will you marry me?"
7036,Gabrielle,"carlos! he's at your house. oh, he just let himself in. there you go. he's home."
5913,Gabrielle,"carlos is dead, xiao-mei."
4268,Gabrielle,the cable guy fell. he hit his head on the tub. he may have a concussion.
5429,Gabrielle,"carlos, you can't do this. you can't just go to africa."
6878,Gabrielle,"no, i really can't."
4579,Gabrielle,i worked ten hours today. i'll go by tomorrow. she doesn't even know when i'm there.
4303,Gabrielle,"you know, juanita, i'm not going to the supermarket. i'm going to the lingerie store."
4239,Gabrielle,"wow, aren't you the little artist. what are those, flamingos?"
4340,Gabrielle,what did you do?
4412,Gabrielle,of course!
5105,Gabrielle,"say what you want, but john rowland loved me like no one ever has. not as a trophy or as a possession, but for me. he loved me."
4946,Gabrielle,i can't get it hot enough. my hormones are killing my taste buds..
6448,Gabrielle,what?! you can't abandon me! there's a madman stalking me. my life is on the line. do you know how scared i am?
7835,Gabrielle,juanita! stop talking to your sister!
7264,Gabrielle,he was going to kill me! he had a gun.
5332,Gabrielle,"you don't have a, a window thingy."
8430,Gabrielle,"well, i'd say let's talk about it tonight, but who knows if you're even gonna come home?"
4958,Gabrielle,you sit. sit!
7411,Gabrielle,holy matrimony. bring it on.
4264,Gabrielle,it's the cable guy. he's three hours late.
8394,Gabrielle,"fine. we're a couple of users. the big question is, are we still friends?"
7319,Gabrielle,no. no.
5572,Gabrielle,i wanna have a baby.i wanna have a baby with you.
4881,Gabrielle,why would they call your parents? it's your account.
8508,Gabrielle,"anyway, i know you must be bored silly, so go ahead and make your escape."
8305,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, you bleached blonde twit. i'm not talking about me. i'm talking about you and bradley."
6267,Gabrielle,mom?
7919,Gabrielle,why not?
4427,Gabrielle,"oh, they're terrific. we just appreciate you all stopping by."
5057,Gabrielle,"honey, you and your macho pride. just tell him you're flattered, but you don't swing that way."
5623,Gabrielle,"off the top of my head,you're on medicare?"
7023,Gabrielle,"well,not unless we kill you."
5239,Gabrielle,"and you know what? a lesser woman would let you rot in here, but i'm not gonna do that. i'm not gonna give you the satisfaction. so you better start packing up your shanks or whatever you people make in here, because you're coming home with me!"
4942,Gabrielle,i wanna make sure you'll let me protect you.
5033,Gabrielle,"hi, uh, i need a paternity test."
4249,Gabrielle,"well, you won't be around tomorrow, 'cause you have school."
5918,Gabrielle,oh!why is your back all sweaty?
4973,Gabrielle,"hey, i thought you might be thirsty."
7042,Gabrielle,"not the same girl like she's changed, or not the same girl because she's been replaced by a robot?"
5493,Gabrielle,"bree,maybe you should call in a favor from your police detective pal,have him poke around."
7514,Gabrielle,"you're right, baby. i'm sorry. let me try it this way. you listen to me, you blind son of a bitch. if you don't get this mangy, 6- nippled, cujo wannabe off my satin sheets, you won't just need a dog to get around. you'll need a motorized wheelchair that you steer with your tongue."
4197,Gabrielle,hello jonathan.
6545,Gabrielle,"no, zach, i only accept jewelry from men i plan on sleeping with."
4189,Gabrielle,"nope. no, no, no, no. you're not gonna buy your way outta this one."
7049,Gabrielle,"hey, what's up?"
8154,Gabrielle,"so i said, ""pumpkin""-- that's what i call jon bon jovi-- i said, ""pumpkin, even if i could steer a yacht, i'm certainly not about to do it in 5-inch heels."" true story."
8117,Gabrielle,my rage just needs to catch its breath. okay. okay. i am willing to forget this entire incident if you just go jump in that bathtub right now. what do you say?
5576,Gabrielle,"oh, the slave.wow. looks well-fed."
4809,Gabrielle,"hi honey, i'm back."
7406,Gabrielle,"absolutely. oh, but if i don't, i promise you, i will change religions."
8165,Gabrielle,"oh, clothes said that, not me."
5383,Gabrielle,share? what if you have the car and i need to go shopping?
8329,Gabrielle,were your coworkers. bradley fired you. remember?
8227,Gabrielle,really?
5214,Gabrielle,are you seeing this?
6795,Gabrielle,"hey, edie!"
7927,Gabrielle,"carlos, she is just a lonely old woman yearning for some friendship and human contact. and i, for one, am happy to be that human."
6951,Gabrielle,i'm hardly flawless. i'm sure i have a blemish hidden away somewhere.
4291,Gabrielle,i think he's hiding something.
8002,Gabrielle,"hey, i'm not a short-order cook. i don't have time to make different meals for everyone."
6871,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. she looks just like me when i was that age!"
5017,Gabrielle,"he knows how men look at me, and, well, i, i didn't exactly ease his mind. i falsely led him to believe i was having an affair. and, and before carlos's house arrest, he was always working, and he was never with me. and i thought that maybe if he believed i was having an affair, he would realize he loved me. and i know it sounds stupid, i do. i just-"
5735,Gabrielle,"wait,if it's not frank's,then whose is it?"
5972,Gabrielle,"oh my god, you're serious?no sex at all? no even-- um--"
5173,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, if you don't mind the hemorrhoids and the nausea, it's quite the party."
4765,Gabrielle,"carlos, we're not exactly flush with cash right now. let her be true to her roots. she was born humble and barefoot."
6575,Gabrielle,okay. so come back when you're done. i'll wait up.
5655,Gabrielle,"so just to be clear,some slutty cheerleader gets knocked up by the soccer coach behind the local gas 'n gulp,and she is going to make sure we're quality people?"
6381,Gabrielle,but that doesn't prove he had anything to do with monique's murder.
4183,Gabrielle,"i, uh, i just finished a workout."
4972,Gabrielle,"i'm pregnant, and it might be yours."
7439,Gabrielle,sure.
5304,Gabrielle,"i go shopping, you rip toilets out of the wall. different strokes."
4822,Gabrielle,you don't trust me?
6522,Gabrielle,"okay, deal, you little skunk."
8102,Gabrielle,"it took a toll on us when we couldn't pay the gas bill, carlos. it took a toll on us when juanita was sent home from day care because the check bounced. but i handled it, and now it's your turn to handle it."
4152,Gabrielle,"well, he promised to give me everything i've ever wanted."
4273,Gabrielle,"no, she dusts with them."
5333,Gabrielle,"you don't have a door handle, either."
5789,Gabrielle,"hi. hi,pretty girl.oh,yes,mommy has to go.mommy has to go,so she can stay pretty and thin and you can be proud of her."
5879,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. okay. sorry."
8480,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. i can't believe we forgot."
5632,Gabrielle,"okay,first of all,no one asked you.and the only reason you care about my mother is because of that ridiculous suggestion she offered."
5533,Gabrielle,"babies, babies, babies.you sound llike a broken record.i just had a miscarriage.it's gonna take some time before i'm ready to get pregnant again."
7187,Gabrielle,please!
6613,Gabrielle,"is it really good, or are you just pretending you had a slice? you and i did not have sex. admit it!"
4980,Gabrielle,she found out it was in self-defense. i think they've cleared everything up.
4808,Gabrielle,"no, sometimes you do."
5599,Gabrielle,"absolutely.xiao-mei,you are a very special girl,so--so you take care, okay?"
6874,Gabrielle,i see you've picked up the pieces.
7641,Gabrielle,it's a sting. go out the back now.
7150,Gabrielle,that's what's so exciting.
4247,Gabrielle,"don't look at your feet. don't look at your feet, look at the road. look at the road. ow. uh, okay, find your balance. find your balance. okay, it's all you. it's all you, you're doing great! okay, stay to the right. watch the car. watch the car. watch the car! are you okay?"

7512,Gabrielle,"well, if you ever want to bond with my boobs again, you'll get her off!"
7081,Gabrielle,were you widowed or divorced?
8608,Gabrielle,"well, then it must've been a gambling problem."
7818,Gabrielle,really? you're so lucky.
6558,Gabrielle,"works for me, too."
8311,Gabrielle,this is why people should never get their hair cut in a mall!
5280,Gabrielle,"hi. my, uh, friends just left, and i was hoping you could come over and cut me out of this thing."
6455,Gabrielle,this jerk has been terrorizing me. he broke into my house!
5364,Gabrielle,what the hell did they do to you in that prison?
5342,Gabrielle,this is stupid. i didn't even want this baby.
5697,Gabrielle,yeah. my little girl's gonna inherit some wonderful genes.
4453,Gabrielle,"thank you, father crowley. you have been a tremendous comfort. um, i will let you do your thing."
8602,Gabrielle,i'll explain it to him later.
7077,Gabrielle,a bracelet's always nice. for edie's sister.
8192,Gabrielle,"jean, carlos is taking me to the palm, not out for hoagies. make it perfect."
5579,Gabrielle,"oh, this time.you are quickly becoming father crowley's go-to guy for charity cases."
6360,Gabrielle,i'd love to grab a cup of coffee--or something.
6804,Gabrielle,you're about to find out.
7678,Gabrielle,"juanita, this dress is awfully tight. i don't think you can get into it."
5832,Gabrielle,"no, we've been--we've been feeding her, and we--we've been bathing her,and we wake up in the middle of the night and we rock her--"
4442,Gabrielle,have you lost your mind? what did you tell him?
5197,Gabrielle,"okay, skip it. i'm holding my marriage together by my fingernails. if carlos serves his full sentence, i don't think we're gonna make it. so please, i need you."
7351,Gabrielle,"no, you!"
5626,Gabrielle,"i have a migraine.i'm gonna go lay down upstairs.then when i get up,i hope we can all talk about this like rational human beings."
5059,Gabrielle,"well, how much money?"
7457,Gabrielle,"i know. primo spot, isn't it? what? i have a thingy."
5608,Gabrielle,"no,i'm just surprised you're here.it's valentine's day.don't you and mr. hedgefund have plans?i know carlos and i do."
5432,Gabrielle,"yes, right. she has you flying halfway across the world to help the poor and there's perfectly good poor right here. for god's sakes, give a buck to a homeless guy."
7368,Gabrielle,go to hell.
7650,Gabrielle,"teddy bear? what is that, code for ""a pound of blow""?"
4342,Gabrielle,i don't know why you're telling me this.
7878,Gabrielle,i don't know. but you would have if i hadn't started my period. how could you have done this?
4372,Gabrielle,"not that long, why?"" ""carlos, what is it?"

7576,Gabrielle,don't. we're waiting for ellie. she's finishing up with a customer.
8343,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, i'm flattered, but i only did that to help susan out."
4690,Gabrielle,think he'll get violent?
7984,Gabrielle,"come on. let's get you out of here. let's go. hey, since i'm saving your life and all, you wanna think about maybe keeping us in your will?"

4246,Gabrielle,"sure, one of these days."
7636,Gabrielle,oh.
5326,Gabrielle,so what if it is?
4764,Gabrielle,"she treated me like trash!"" ""god rest her soul."
5663,Gabrielle,you're in advertising.you can do it.just write us a character reference saying we're great with kids.
6434,Gabrielle,it would've been nice if someone else could've found you.there was a whole lot of drama around here.
4333,Gabrielle,while you get changed i'm going to run to the book store.
6501,Gabrielle,i know. she practically had sparklers coming out of her ass.
5923,Gabrielle,"honey, uh, i think it's time to unpack the pants."
7354,Gabrielle,move your ass!
4177,Gabrielle,damn it!? come on.
5841,Gabrielle,i don't understand.it's from the government.
6092,Gabrielle,"i need cash, and you don't expect me to sell my stuff, do you?"
5521,Gabrielle,what?
4142,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no, i'm not going."
6497,Gabrielle,i mind. we're divorced. i can't keep running to you every time i get scared. i want to be the kind of woman who can take care of herself.
7350,Gabrielle,no!
5840,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei,i appreciate your grief,but,really,you're bringing everybody down.will you pull it together?"
6965,Gabrielle,"okay, look, no! i already married a man who put his career before me, and i swore i wasn't gonna do it again."
6005,Gabrielle,your mama's pearls? carlos! thank you.
8003,Gabrielle,"okay, look. mommy needs to lose a few pounds, and it's not easy eating healthy with you two in front of me, scarfing down all the good stuff. so what do you say? you want to help mommy be beautiful again?"
4491,Gabrielle,"thank god, tom could fill in at the last minute."
8149,Gabrielle,"you hear that, carlos? you've brought me to a place where people are named ""eli scruggs."""
4884,Gabrielle,ha ha. i don't know. i'd watch your back.
8050,Gabrielle,"hey, this featherhead kept this family afloat for five years. you have no idea what i had to do to keep this roof over our heads."
8351,Gabrielle,well--
5771,Gabrielle,put down the burrito.what is all this crap about me not getting help?
8245,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, you heard maria the other night. your hard work is what's brought them so much closer."
5664,Gabrielle,"keeping that in mind,would it also be okay if we were your kids' godparents?"
6057,Gabrielle,this is exactly what we needed.especially after everything i've been through lately.i am all about relaxing and rejuvenating--
6950,Gabrielle,"well, i'm glad you could join us, milton. it's good to get to know you before the wedding."
6889,Gabrielle,"it was short notice, okay? these people are booked months in advance. the only people available were thones you just bailed on."
6677,Gabrielle,"trust me, it was a steal. i'm gonna go powder my nose, and then you can start showing me off."
8312,Gabrielle,"jeez, bradley, you scared me!"
6820,Gabrielle,"carlos, stop! put me down! what are you doing?!"
7502,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, when she learns how to make granite sparkle, she can have more."
6066,Gabrielle,who's there? i can't see you.
8254,Gabrielle,"oh, you're in counseling. that's great."
5861,Gabrielle,would i lie to family?
7598,Gabrielle,you were only doing it because you're the devil.
7744,Gabrielle,"what do you mean, they're unhappy? they're rich! they have jewels and cooks. they use ""winter"" as a verb."
4178,Gabrielle,"come on, come on, hurry! let's go, let's go!"
4384,Gabrielle,"what do you mean, it stopped working. that thing has, like, a $15,000 credit limit."
4813,Gabrielle,because i couldn't trust you to make the right decision.
7237,Gabrielle,it's bree.
5766,Gabrielle,"you know,i'm a little tired, but it's not too bad."
4975,Gabrielle,"well, uh, i had to, um, tell him some news that was a little bit upsetting for him."
6091,Gabrielle,"carlos, i see you got my flier."
7995,Gabrielle,"thank you. god, what am i gonna do?"
4993,Gabrielle,i just left my husband.
7772,Gabrielle,really?
5357,Gabrielle,mmm. i guess i owe the pope a thank-you note.
8237,Gabrielle,we're ready for dessert now. wrap up ten lobsters to go.
6383,Gabrielle,"back off,you son of a bi*ch!"
5962,Gabrielle,pick it up!
7808,Gabrielle,"honey, we want bethany to be our friend, so if she wants to spin, just suck it up and spin."
5527,Gabrielle,be a good person.knock yourself out.
6225,Gabrielle,how dare you! that is a vicious lie.
8661,Gabrielle,"yeah, the economy has hit us all. so--what kind of boyfriends can afford things like this?"
8426,Gabrielle,"carlos, get back here! carlos! could you at least scratch my nose?"
7289,Gabrielle,of course.
7728,Gabrielle,"oh, they are fun. mm-hmm. but i enjoy my intimate lunches with michelle even more. we have intimate lunches. we're friends."
6145,Gabrielle,"mnh-mnh, not right now. phil and i are getting in the hot tub. ooh, phil, did you bring your suit?"
5628,Gabrielle,"oh,it's in the hotel lobby.so go ahead,i'm right behind ya."
8216,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah, i quit that."
7405,Gabrielle,"okay, look, in the eyes of the church, carlos and i were never divorced. technically, the affair was with victor, and god smote him. so we're good. all right, yes, i've been a bad catholic. enough with the guilt thing. are you gonna marry us or not?"
7444,Gabrielle,"i know you are, babe. and i know it's hard, and i'm gonna try to be more sensitive to your needs. now hurry up and finish. i have to go to the store."
4715,Gabrielle,"so, uh, mike. the suspense is killing us. why don't you just tell us the bad news?"
7240,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, victor. a month in rio sounds like heaven, doesn't it?"
4339,Gabrielle,carlos.
4490,Gabrielle,"susan mayer saw us last night, and she knows everything."
5393,Gabrielle,hi. carlos will be down in a little while. we had an intense talk. he's resting.
8253,Gabrielle,"well, don't spend too much. why don't you just get him a card?"
4604,Gabrielle,john and i made a clean break. i think it's best if we just keep our distance.
4578,Gabrielle,"well, dig in. i am way too tired to eat."
7796,Gabrielle,so?! there's waffles in the freezer! and get mommy some ice!
7589,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! shouldn't we hear ellie's side of the story first?"
7301,Gabrielle,fine. i'll go.
7503,Gabrielle,"carlos, i said no--fine. one treat. that's it. those things are expensive, and until your disability kicks in, we have to tighten our belts."
5411,Gabrielle,i was just about to ask you the same thing. you were supposed to meet me at the spa.
4694,Gabrielle,oh.
7955,Gabrielle,"okay, we're done here. good-bye. am i not making myself clear? get off my property!"
4345,Gabrielle,"thank you, yoa lin."
6847,Gabrielle,"vern, you're just awful. and as it happens, so am i."
7754,Gabrielle,"okay, just let me handle this."
8463,Gabrielle,"sure, you can, just not as many as me."
6571,Gabrielle,what?
5467,Gabrielle,really? because i sense that you're annoyed you found me here when you weren't home. am i wrong?
8271,Gabrielle,the federal deficit.
8470,Gabrielle,what?
7621,Gabrielle,"uh, you know, he's a handyman. he knows how to--get in there--and make stuff work."
6514,Gabrielle,"gee, well--not as wild as what i'm about to say. you can take me to dinner."
4920,Gabrielle,"carlos, you son of a bitch! i am pregnant and it's all your fault!"
5177,Gabrielle,what the hell are you doing?
5200,Gabrielle,"hey, that's my wine!"
8356,Gabrielle,"i'm not jealous. it's just--you can't hire her. i'm mrs. president, and i get a vote."
7148,Gabrielle,"absolutely. it's kind of exciting, though."
8361,Gabrielle,"well, she's obviously stopped counting calories since the last time you saw her."
7396,Gabrielle,"oh, shoot. did i miss mass? was it at 9:00?"
4844,Gabrielle,"john, what are you doing?"
5836,Gabrielle,"oh,no,thanks,xiao-mei.the poor thing.she was so attached to lily."
8593,Gabrielle,"okay, you know what? this conversation is over. go to your room! you, too, bobblehead."
8261,Gabrielle,"no, we can't tell her. we'd have to give the money back."
5769,Gabrielle,"no,it's okay.i'll win this battle later."
4859,Gabrielle,you want my respect? then tear up the post nup!
4351,Gabrielle,"well, since, i'm gonna have to be doing the cooking, and the cleaning, and all the shopping, like the other wives--"
8390,Gabrielle,"how dare you! and, yes, i did!"
8636,Gabrielle,fine. ok.
4519,Gabrielle,"yao lin, listen to me. it's very important that we find carlos' passport. i've already looked through his office, so i need you to search the bedroom."
5888,Gabrielle,"well, what's wrong with the guest bathroom?"
8230,Gabrielle,"no, no. it's perfect. i just want to tell you how helpful you've been to me over the years, and i'm really grateful. thank you."
7940,Gabrielle,"uh--next weekend, uh, carlos and i have plans."
5374,Gabrielle,"oh, i invited sister mary hot pants over for lunch."
5003,Gabrielle,danielle called.
7988,Gabrielle,"and, what, you're afraid it's gonna impair his vision? i'm sorry. you were saying-?"
5944,Gabrielle,"well, since this is our last time, i guess we can make the most of it."
7302,Gabrielle,"can we at least have a drink before we go? calm our nerves? i mean, you can't talk to the cops the way you've been babbling to me."
6356,Gabrielle,i'll get the ball rolling. anybody have a yeast infection?
6633,Gabrielle,not exactly.
6726,Gabrielle,good.
5904,Gabrielle,"honey, look. i bought us matching golf outfits for our lessons tomorrow."
5138,Gabrielle,he refused to help me get a conjugal visit.
7890,Gabrielle,"well, pip-pip and arrivederci!"
8074,Gabrielle,yeah.
5447,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes,come here.now on behalf of all the cheerleaders in the world,forgive us."
7492,Gabrielle,"there you are! oh, you must be roxy! aren't you the cutest thing! oh! okay, not too close. it's silk."
6377,Gabrielle,"hi. bill? i was wondering, do you have plans saturday night?"
5694,Gabrielle,"no! no, actually, all we think about when we look at you is how pretty you are."
7105,Gabrielle,sorry.
5896,Gabrielle,like hell she is.that is my egg.
8550,Gabrielle,"sweetie, you're 6. there's a lot of things i can do that you don't."
4299,Gabrielle,i'll be outside doing my yoga.
5006,Gabrielle,we're just gonna talk about non-crisis things.
7373,Gabrielle,"um, remember that day, uh--when al was going to drop off the account information?"
6085,Gabrielle,who says it has to end?
5843,Gabrielle,"oh,no,no,xiao-mei,you're not going anywhere.hey,you're much too important to carlos and me."
6150,Gabrielle,yes! yes!
7981,Gabrielle,"no, i haven't. why? is he supposed to be here?"
7212,Gabrielle,can't say hello to a girl?
8153,Gabrielle,hello there. welcome to my home.
7533,Gabrielle,"don't judge me. you don't know this hound from hell. i raise my voice a teensy bit, and she barks, or i give carlos a little smack, and she growls."
7813,Gabrielle,bethany's mom will take juanita once a week for two whole hours. that is sex and a nap.
6322,Gabrielle,"but i'm helping them.they love me!wait,please,vern,you have to give me a chance to fix this."
4429,Gabrielle,no change. all we can do is wait and hope for the best.
6698,Gabrielle,"a guy who can admit he screwed up, one who's not trying to impress me every second of the day with how perfect and charming he is. i wouldn't mind seeing more of that guy."
7774,Gabrielle,and don't worry. no one will hear about this from me.
4225,Gabrielle,7. three couples and susan. does that sound right?
4557,Gabrielle,tom! lynette! what are you doing here?
7679,Gabrielle,"oh, i think we're gonna need the next size up."
5908,Gabrielle,"fine, if you feel that way about it. hey, i'm sorry. i'm just a little on edge today."
7101,Gabrielle,all right. ready? get set--go.
5145,Gabrielle,is this about the gay bashing thing? he's innocent.
7273,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm getting pretty good at that."
6409,Gabrielle,what?
6784,Gabrielle,"edie, are you okay?"
5313,Gabrielle,"no! no, you can't come in!"
5761,Gabrielle,maybe.but we don't have to make it easy for them.
8205,Gabrielle,"you know, maybe i should give this a little gander."
5305,Gabrielle,"oh, please. what do you think?"
5748,Gabrielle,"okay.hi.hi.oh,honey,you were right."
4603,Gabrielle,what do you want me to do?
6983,Gabrielle,yes. i can see that.
6418,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna make it up to you, okay? once i'm done, i'll send you flowers."
4683,Gabrielle,i don't think so.
7272,Gabrielle,"aah! victor! oh, my god! victor! oh! oh, my god!"
5968,Gabrielle,"what's the occasion?bree: oh, um, no occasion.just a little get together."
7752,Gabrielle,"okay, that one hurt."
6151,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, let's get something straight. you and i are not gonna have sex tonight."
7670,Gabrielle,that's the closet!
4360,Gabrielle,the coffee is a little hot.
6912,Gabrielle,"no, not exactly. just a--small change of plans about the wedding."
7627,Gabrielle,"hey, sweetie."
6022,Gabrielle,"okay, here's the drill. my ex is here and i want to piss him off so just act like you're all hot for me and there's a hundred buck tip in it for you."
8084,Gabrielle,"okay, let's skip to the important part - who was it?"
8532,Gabrielle,then why did you keep hanging out with her?
4287,Gabrielle,wow.
4316,Gabrielle,you can't be serious.
5807,Gabrielle,huh?
7676,Gabrielle,look at this mess! you are lucky i got in here before you touched my dresses!
4966,Gabrielle,it's just salsa.
7142,Gabrielle,that's the tension--leaving your body.
5691,Gabrielle,we're gonna have to stare at this face for the next 18 years.i don't think now is the time to skimp on quality.
5965,Gabrielle,"i am the meanest person.you've been in the country a year.modify your nouns, damn it."
4561,Gabrielle,"you know, with their perfectly crafted interior, and peaceful, quiet tuning."
7497,Gabrielle,don't give me your blind sarcasm. i saw a collie on tv who could push a lawn mower. do you have one of those?
8346,Gabrielle,i don't know.
5434,Gabrielle,here.
4196,Gabrielle,"i don't know. be the way you used to be, surprise me, take my breath away."
7749,Gabrielle,"what? no! no, no deal! the nondriving blind guy does not speak for me."
4847,Gabrielle,"because one day, when the time is right i'm gonna tell him how he drove me into your arms and that's going to kill him."
5868,Gabrielle,"oh! okay,honey,only good swimmers now."
7033,Gabrielle,edie! what brings you here?
8618,Gabrielle,mark died? i didn't know.
4637,Gabrielle,clean it now.
5676,Gabrielle,"there are ways to get babies,carlos.it just might cost us."
7517,Gabrielle,"oh. yes. okay, let's go. let's go, roxy. let's go, roxy. let's go. let's go in the car."
7231,Gabrielle,"victor, i know you're only doing this because a divorce would hurt your run for governor."
8270,Gabrielle,shh.
7093,Gabrielle,orson.
7012,Gabrielle,"really? because she thinks you're getting married.everyone else thinks you're getting married.so,again,best wishes."
5727,Gabrielle,you said we could give her gifts.everybody loves getting cash.
8603,Gabrielle,thank you.
5299,Gabrielle,honey.
5784,Gabrielle,"yeah,honey,can you take that downstairs?thank you."
6463,Gabrielle,how about lunch?
6479,Gabrielle,i'm on a date with zach young. nothing's ever gonna seem weird again.
4405,Gabrielle,"it's her dream, and don't you want her to be happy?"
6367,Gabrielle,what about your dad? don't you care what he wants?
5395,Gabrielle,"look, i don't mean any disrespect. it's just now that carlos is home, we need to get back on our routine, and we can't do that if he keeps running off to church and charity bake sales. we need us time. do you know what i mean?"
5414,Gabrielle,"sister mary, will you excuse us, please?"
7518,Gabrielle,"oh, roxy, this way."
5597,Gabrielle,"hmm, you like that?no.an old, fat stockbroker gave this to me.it's not worth anything.you can have it."
6783,Gabrielle,"he is, and i've never been happier."
6086,Gabrielle,"well, i'm single now, and i thought we could maybe--"
5912,Gabrielle,make me something strong.i have nine more holes with that guy.
8386,Gabrielle,"so did you get a good office? were the people nice? oh, what about lucy? do you like her?"
6759,Gabrielle,how was i supposed to know the cops were gonna release the photos to the press?
8198,Gabrielle,here you go. all signed.
4615,Gabrielle,what?
8160,Gabrielle,"oh, i got it. i got it. go, go, go, go, go."
6856,Gabrielle,"ow, you're hurting me!"
5993,Gabrielle,"yeah, bree, i always thought of you as a person who wants time to plan."
8371,Gabrielle,no. why would you think that?
5147,Gabrielle,why does everybody have a problem with me having sex with my husband?
6837,Gabrielle,you can't talk to me like that!
4164,Gabrielle,you see that man who just walked away? can you make sure he has a drink in his hand all night long.
6503,Gabrielle,"oh. okay, why don't you support me from the lobby? i have some networking to do. my girl just won the pageant."
5605,Gabrielle,i want to have a babywith you.
7511,Gabrielle,"no. no, it's not. i read the pamphlet steve left. these dogs are not allowed on furniture."
6757,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, i'm gonna hang on to these. they're a little revealing."
7506,Gabrielle,"carlos, i'm getting my hair done! end of discussion! what are you barking at? you got your damn treat. you know, if we really want to save money, you could cut down on those cuban cigars."
8005,Gabrielle,huh.
4987,Gabrielle,"ah, ah, ah, pregnant, cave man, remember?"
8182,Gabrielle,"yikes. that's, like, a half a step away from selling your eggs on the internet."
4358,Gabrielle,of course you do.
6851,Gabrielle,"you could try, but you might not want to. see, i'm engaged to victor lang. ring a bell? the mayor? your new boss?"
6739,Gabrielle,you have no idea.
5921,Gabrielle,"well, i am gabrielle solis."
4706,Gabrielle,"you know, carlos, i've been broke a lot of times in my life. but, i've never been poor, because poor is just a state of mind, and right now you and i are just--"
7736,Gabrielle,which we're not on.
6221,Gabrielle,"oh, he's cute!"
4472,Gabrielle,john!
5750,Gabrielle,shh. in a minute.
6363,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetheart. i have a feeling i know what this is about."
8164,Gabrielle,what?
6800,Gabrielle,"edie, there are a thousand single men in fairview. why do you have to date my ex-husband?"
7865,Gabrielle,"i am done fighting off your bionic sperm. you're getting snipped, and that's final."
7482,Gabrielle,"oh, you bet i am! every morning, the toothpaste has to be to the left of the sink, because if it's not, you can't find it, and i have to put it there. and--and sometimes-- i don't know--i'm driving, or i'm in line at the bank and i think, ""is the toothpaste there?"" so then i have to run home and check because i don't want you reaching for the tube and not being able to find it. i just didn't think this was how it was all gonna turn out, carlos. i didn't think that every day for the rest of my life, a part of me is always gonna think, ""where's the toothpaste?"""
6185,Gabrielle,"yeah, we're drinking on the porch. you got a problem with that?"
5633,Gabrielle,generous?don't you see the strings attached?
4803,Gabrielle,are you trying to buy us off?
7156,Gabrielle,"well, we're not saying that."
8249,Gabrielle,hey.
5073,Gabrielle,okay.
4343,Gabrielle,this is getting really weird.i think we should go to the police.
5066,Gabrielle,oh.
8338,Gabrielle,s-so what kind of kiss are we talking about?
7937,Gabrielle,"rise and shine, girls. rise and shi--oh, my god! what are you doing?!"
8045,Gabrielle,oh. i had to sell it a few months ago so i could make the mortgage. i'm sorry.
6924,Gabrielle,so all of this planning and attention to detail--that's all been about your image?
6604,Gabrielle,"i am in hell.i just tried to break up with zach,and the little twerp played the dead mommy card."
8138,Gabrielle,easy for you to say. they told me they love you more than me.
5629,Gabrielle,i'm going home.
7690,Gabrielle,"well, next time, give her a carrot and put her on a roller coaster. have you tried to lift her lately?"
8217,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, maybe you should take it up with my lawyer. here he is."
6963,Gabrielle,"fairview is my home, and i don't want to leave it. and you can't make this decision without me. i'm gonna be your wife."
5512,Gabrielle,"well,when you left prison,did they leave you a contact list?"
4712,Gabrielle,what?
5328,Gabrielle,"no, it's not, because i know what you're thinking."
7470,Gabrielle,i'm just dropping off a few letters. you might as well just wait here.
8362,Gabrielle,what? but--you two used to have sex.
8199,Gabrielle,"oh, no need. i'm up for anything. although i did just get a manicure, so nothing that might chip a nail."
6867,Gabrielle,"mm, it's not as bad as it looks."
6277,Gabrielle,where do you get off talking to me like that? i shot thirty-six covers by the time i was twenty!
5794,Gabrielle,"you know,it's been challenging,but i-i soldier on. so what about you?you look so rested."
7631,Gabrielle,"oh, you moron! there was no affair! that was the cop. ellie caught us putting the bug in her room. that was just an excuse we used as a cover."
5551,Gabrielle,"mm, not that long ago.look, i sorta told a fib,so--how many ""hail marys"" is that gonna set me back?"
6709,Gabrielle,music. loud music.
6622,Gabrielle,he's devastated.
5937,Gabrielle,you were a virgin?
7058,Gabrielle,"you must be freezing. you know, i have the cutest shawl in the car, so i'm just gonna run out and get it for you."
5746,Gabrielle,"oh,we missed it!"
7303,Gabrielle,you okay with tequila?
6278,Gabrielle,do you know how many photographers would die to work with me again?
5985,Gabrielle,don't you dare give me that attitude.you have no idea what i've been going through this past six months.
5229,Gabrielle,"david, where are you going?"
7515,Gabrielle,"carlos, i mean it. who's it gonna be - me or the dog?"
7698,Gabrielle,okay. why don't you go throw that in the trash? and i'm gonna get the car started.
4241,Gabrielle,okay! so we're good. right?
5215,Gabrielle,he's just mowing the lawn like nothing ever happened. what should we do? should we call the police?
8387,Gabrielle,"ooh! what's going on? i mentioned lucy, and you get all weird. is something going on with her--and carlos?"
5134,Gabrielle,oh really. then how about for this?
7644,Gabrielle,"okay, so here's the deal. bree needs all of these wedding favors wrapped by tomorrow, and she's really counting on me, so-- i'm gonna need you to hurry."
5935,Gabrielle,the best you've ever had.
8308,Gabrielle,"well, call the vatican, 'cause we're gonna need a manger and some hay."
8286,Gabrielle,you painted that? you're good.
8210,Gabrielle,"look, i appreciate this whole military commando act, but i'm new at this, and frankly, this is a bit much."
6631,Gabrielle,opponent?
7242,Gabrielle,the girls are gonna be so jealous.
6708,Gabrielle,"well, you laid out all your positions. don't you want to get acquainted with mine?"
6077,Gabrielle,oh! your fiance?
8060,Gabrielle,that's wonderful! oh!
7284,Gabrielle,"oh, okay. and say what? ""yes, officer, my lover and i knocked my husband overboard twice and left him for dead. okay. bye-bye."" i don't think so."
7043,Gabrielle,"uh, susan."
5677,Gabrielle,"$20,000.is that proof enough for you?"
7358,Gabrielle,you really hate me?
5233,Gabrielle,"okay, yeah, david, if you don't get back in there right now, i will go get a gun and shoot you myself."
5111,Gabrielle,"hello, john. long time, no see."
4153,Gabrielle,yes.
4698,Gabrielle,"well, i guess that makes sense in a weird sort of way."
4365,Gabrielle,"yeah, i've seen who you've been busy with."
6456,Gabrielle,your boss?
6009,Gabrielle,yeah. that's our wedding present to bree.
7484,Gabrielle,"here, honey. let me."
6511,Gabrielle,"oh, fine, i'll do it."
4662,Gabrielle,"but, we will do whatever you want us to do."
8671,Gabrielle,all right.
6382,Gabrielle,are you kidding? what could be more romantic?
7494,Gabrielle,"well, i have got a million questions about this little lifesaver here."
4735,Gabrielle,why should i have to wait? it's my port-a-potty.
4739,Gabrielle,in what way?
6246,Gabrielle,"i had a career and a future,but i gave it all up for you,and what did i get in return?"
4894,Gabrielle,"yes, you are. because if you don't, i'm going to put on my new shoes and walk out that door."
5083,Gabrielle,is that what richie said?
4525,Gabrielle,hey! hey! what are you doing? where are you taking my car?
5035,Gabrielle,paternity test results? i know. i'm in the same situation.
5799,Gabrielle,"oh,thank god!oh,honey,i'm so sorry.i'm never gonna leave you again. oh!yes. yes."
7227,Gabrielle,"susan, hey, it's me. um, sorry to leave this message on your machine, but can you tell the other girls i'm, uh, going to be by myself for a while? i-- just--going through some stuff and need to think. um-- oh, god, that's my car ready to take me to the airport, so i'll tell you everything when i get back. okay? love you. bye."
5128,Gabrielle,"actually, the one you gave me is really nice, too."
6457,Gabrielle,"this is gabrielle. who the hell is this? yes, i got your token of esteem,' and i'm not impressed. because you're freaking me out, that's why! no, i don't care how much it cost. that's beside the point. really? that much?"
7122,Gabrielle,"yeah, we get a ball of yarn, and we each cut a piece that we think is just big enough to fit around your stomach, and the one closest wins a prize."
8051,Gabrielle,i didn't sell your watch.
5895,Gabrielle,"that is not the point. we are a week into this pregnancy,and you're already putting xiao-mei's needs before mine."
8376,Gabrielle,great news! you got the job!
8566,Gabrielle,"oh, can i at least use the bathroom first?"
7215,Gabrielle,"i don't have to sleep with him, just stay with him for political reasons. it's basically a modeling fee for a 13-month photo op."
7385,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetie, don't. i want you to remember al like i do-- at his desk, with a big smile on his face, surrounded by all his files. by the way, where are those files?"
6275,Gabrielle,"oh, i made it work. i'm hot mom."
7074,Gabrielle,"well, victor has a teachers' union thing on thursday. guess i'll see you on thursday. carlos, what's happening here? i mean, with us. why are we still sneaking around?"
7921,Gabrielle,"carlos, just nod your head, 'cause i ain't leaving this pool."
6110,Gabrielle,you peed in my shampoo. admit it!
6483,Gabrielle,"well, john rowland was a mistake. i was lonely."
4902,Gabrielle,it is. its is. it's just the smell is a little intense.
7638,Gabrielle,yes?
5516,Gabrielle,i'm living with it!
6907,Gabrielle,"oh! no, stupid. i mean, a double wedding!"
8035,Gabrielle,"so you see, it belonged to my husband's grandfather, and if i don't get it back, i am telling you, i'm gonna be in the crapper."
7887,Gabrielle,what proposal?
7704,Gabrielle,"looks like mommy's gonna score her first 2 points. come on, juanita. show mommy what a winner you are. juanita! what are you doing?! juanita, stop! juanita! juanita!"
5864,Gabrielle,"honey,come on.we're gonna be late."
8487,Gabrielle,"okay, i got one. i'll go first. edie britt was sexy."
6188,Gabrielle,can i tell you guys something? something i can only tell you guys?
5220,Gabrielle,"well, you protected me from a hail of gun fire, so i thought i'd stop by and give you a card."
8330,Gabrielle,"oh, hi."
4436,Gabrielle,"keep working! what were you thinking, showing up at the hospital?"
8344,Gabrielle,"thank you. i mean, it's sad how it happened, but, you know, when opportunity knocks, you gotta answer the door, right?"
6788,Gabrielle,yeah! i wanna know who's putting that dopey grin on your face.
8168,Gabrielle,i brought muffins.
5796,Gabrielle,"oh,no,you must be mistaken. i just left her.she's at home working."
4252,Gabrielle,"oh my god, when did this happen?"
6220,Gabrielle,there was nothing you could do.
4794,Gabrielle,"yes, hello, again."
5814,Gabrielle,let's talk turkey.what is it gonna take for you to give up the baby?
5959,Gabrielle,"we're out, but i got you a pickle."
7731,Gabrielle,"the bowmans. i found out mrs. bowman is home with the flu. score! oh, will you unclench? it'll be fine."
7795,Gabrielle,to susan mayer--good mom.
4898,Gabrielle,"oh, i would love to have this in my driveway by saturday. i'm having a big barbeque and i want everyone to see it."
4655,Gabrielle,i wanted to call you. i felt terrible about how we left things.
7479,Gabrielle,"to answer your earlier question, yes, i got a manicure. i'm sorry. are we good?"
5754,Gabrielle,taking our baby home.
5449,Gabrielle,was that hysterical?the look on tom's face!
6818,Gabrielle,"i am leaving this party right now, and if you two don't come with me, our friendship is over."
6227,Gabrielle,you recorded our lovemaking?
5103,Gabrielle,i apologized a million times.
7915,Gabrielle,"what the hell? you're never too young to see paris, right?"
8072,Gabrielle,i don't know. i-i can't speak for carlos.
6599,Gabrielle,"well, we were both half-naked, and there was a condom wrapper. and he said i was amazing, which totally sounds like me. he thinks we're a couple now. you have to help me."
6803,Gabrielle,then be prepared to suffer the consequences.
5604,Gabrielle,"carlos,she thinks of us as family."
4846,Gabrielle,"if you really want to get back at him, kiss me."
8540,Gabrielle,was his name carlos solis?
5320,Gabrielle,"yes, i do."
5901,Gabrielle,"because i see the writing on the wall,and it scares the hell out of me."
5693,Gabrielle,"yeah, we'll do that.so, libby, who's the father?"
7930,Gabrielle,you sure you don't want to shut your piehole?
6886,Gabrielle,"well, i gotta go."
7298,Gabrielle,"carlos, please."
5209,Gabrielle,"excuse me. hello, david."
4645,Gabrielle,"well, then what did you hire me for?"
4762,Gabrielle,what?
4977,Gabrielle,it is a complicated situation.
7657,Gabrielle,hello?
4654,Gabrielle,"hello, yao lin. how are you?"
5156,Gabrielle,"with all due respect, i will decide for myself what needs to be scratched and when."
4332,Gabrielle,"well,maybe i made a mistake."
7519,Gabrielle,"hi. uh, i'm bringing roxy back."
8397,Gabrielle,"carlos, do you have to go back to work?"
4481,Gabrielle,"susan, hi! do you want to help with the seating cards?"
4653,Gabrielle,"oh, god."
5704,Gabrielle,"no! no,you don't just toss people aside because of the color of their skin."
7282,Gabrielle,victor!
6155,Gabrielle,i'm what?!
6600,Gabrielle,where are you going?
4720,Gabrielle,why?
5022,Gabrielle,john! how did you get in here?
7688,Gabrielle,really? are you okay?
7607,Gabrielle,"well, isn't her room enough?"
6189,Gabrielle,not what i was gonna say.what i was gonna say is with all his conniving and trickery i still love carlos.
4348,Gabrielle,you expect me to take care of this place all by myself?
4276,Gabrielle,"remember when you asked us to pack her things? well, when we did we found a note."
7635,Gabrielle,let me guess. this story ends with you throwing your boyfriend's varsity jacket in the lake?
4528,Gabrielle,why? what else could they take from us?
7897,Gabrielle,"no, just carlos. mrs. hildebrand is taking him to europe as her personal massage therapist."
6777,Gabrielle,"no. damn things traveled five thousand miles, and they were still moist."
8307,Gabrielle,"oh, shayla, he's lying. she's pregnant."
7703,Gabrielle,"really? well, i thought running through that guy's sprinkler would've refreshed you. now come on!"
7407,Gabrielle,"hi, babe. i'm about to do something that's gonna make you very happy."
8235,Gabrielle,"but do you know how much overtime carlos has pulled? how many trips he's taken? he's killed himself. for god sakes, don't do this to my jeweler."
5129,Gabrielle,i don't think a conjugal visit is such a ridiculous request.
5131,Gabrielle,excuse me! we are husband and wife. when we make love it is a very sacred covenant.
8128,Gabrielle,"okay, juanita. what is going on here? why are you being so difficult? when daddy asks you to do something, you just do it."
7655,Gabrielle,savings? nobody does that anymore.
6667,Gabrielle,"shh! they can hear you. oh, my god! there's another rack back here! this all your ex-wife's stuff?"
7448,Gabrielle,it's a black-tie fund-raiser that bree organizes every year.
5251,Gabrielle,not unless we make some.
6842,Gabrielle,what do you mean?
4932,Gabrielle,"don't insult me, carlos! you've been whining about wanting a baby for months. who else could it have been?"
5805,Gabrielle,"yes, she needs the bonnet.it completes the outfit."
4168,Gabrielle,to mary alice.
4511,Gabrielle,carlos.
5772,Gabrielle,"we have the money. what is wrong with getting a little help?then i'll be able to relax once in a while,and i'll be able to be a better mother."
7844,Gabrielle,"oh, wait! no, honey. why don't you wait till after the ceremony?"
5125,Gabrielle,"actually, john, given how stupid both of us have been, this an entirely appropriate ending."
5010,Gabrielle,"well, i'm about to be the mother of your child, which means a lot of responsibility and little time for myself. so if i'm gonna get you out of this mess, you have to reciprocate."
7939,Gabrielle,what?
4229,Gabrielle,where are you?
7013,Gabrielle,"neither am i!you told me you wanna run away together,and then i don't hear from you for a month!"
6320,Gabrielle,"fine, i may have told a few stories about the old days, but as a warning. i didn't say anything inappropriate for kids."
7687,Gabrielle,i had two children.
5729,Gabrielle,thousand?he's a bouncer in a strip club.offer him eight.
7910,Gabrielle,"and it never will, because if you think i'm gonna let you drag carlos off to europe, you're nuts."
5869,Gabrielle,susan?we've all been talking.we've decided you and julie should stay with bree.
8139,Gabrielle,really?
5821,Gabrielle,"signed, sealed, delivered.lily's ours."
6986,Gabrielle,"trust me,victor.this will be a night you'll never forget."
6316,Gabrielle,"vern, what are you doing here?"
5603,Gabrielle,"oh, really?oh, of course you can stay!oh!"
6799,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't know. off the top of my head--dating your friends' exes."
4510,Gabrielle,"but helen, you have to believe me. it's over now."
5753,Gabrielle,no.i'm not giving up the baby.
7075,Gabrielle,"oh, come on. edie's recovered from her little suicide attempt. don't you think it's time to move on?"
6248,Gabrielle,"i think you mean vogue, sweetie."
7717,Gabrielle,thank you.
6716,Gabrielle,"well, stretch, of course. i'm not a complete slut. point is, he hasn't called since."
5090,Gabrielle,this isn't about that.
4170,Gabrielle,what's that?
4671,Gabrielle,did i mention why my husband's home a lot? he's under house arrest.
5955,Gabrielle,"no, you can start dinner."
7112,Gabrielle,i guess you--saw what happened down there.
6964,Gabrielle,"oh, so i don't even get a vote?"
6831,Gabrielle,oh! hi. don't worry. i'm here now.
6492,Gabrielle,"oh, some global financier, saw me on the cover of paris match. good-looking, just not my type."
4656,Gabrielle,okay but -
5404,Gabrielle,you do not want to start a war with me.
6617,Gabrielle,"i'm not mad, zach. i'm done!"
8088,Gabrielle,"oh, my god."
7096,Gabrielle,"okay, when has anyone ever used a poem as a clue?"
7989,Gabrielle,that's fantastic!
6315,Gabrielle,"well, yeah. when's the last time you saw a fat person on a magazine cover? now i'm gonna go talk to vern about our next session. you guys finish lunch so we can get back to work."
6228,Gabrielle,"as a matter of fact, i do have a few thoughts.carlos, you're a dead man! do you hear me?"
4807,Gabrielle,honey. it's not going to happen.
4269,Gabrielle,he was late.
7824,Gabrielle,"no! no, that wasn't real. sometimes i fake it when i wrestle with daddy."
7132,Gabrielle,ew! how did you get those?
4326,Gabrielle,"oh, for god's sake, bree, you're a woman. manipulate him. it's what we do!"
5193,Gabrielle,"look, to be honest, carlos is a little threatened by you. he thinks if we spend too much time together that something might happen."
4541,Gabrielle,"hey, how creepy is mrs. huber's sister?"
5218,Gabrielle,we know what you did to mrs. huber.
6180,Gabrielle,"all right, well, let's just say something happened to postpone the divorce.i would still get my share of that two million, right?"
4198,Gabrielle,"oh, well, don't-- worry about it."
6099,Gabrielle,wait! you can't stay here!
8114,Gabrielle,"you've seen it a hundred times. she loses her shoe, the prince finds it--end of story. let's go."
4722,Gabrielle,ahem. sorry.
6477,Gabrielle,"aren't you sweet? uh, well, anyway, i--i'd love to catch up, but i'm kinda waiting for someone."
8108,Gabrielle,"carlos, what is going on? you're gonna miss your plane."
7742,Gabrielle,you wanna know what's humiliating? waking up one day and finding out you're invisible. now it's official. i've lost everything.
8611,Gabrielle,"it was tiffany china, carlos."
5726,Gabrielle,"oh,honey,he's right,okay.that trashy girl has been lying to us from the get-go.let's just walk away while we can. it's not worth it."
7155,Gabrielle,ooh! they're coming.
6378,Gabrielle,you're kidding. when?
7430,Gabrielle,"ooh, i meant to move that. hang on. let me just pull my panties up so i can help you. okay. here. let's go do it over here."
7200,Gabrielle,this kiss has to last six months. you better make it good.
5226,Gabrielle,of course you were.
4506,Gabrielle,it wasn't susan. it was me.
6822,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. betrayal makes me a little cranky.
5204,Gabrielle,what?
5487,Gabrielle,"no.i kissed tom,and it was a harmless joke.i think if i had kissed anybody else's husband,they would've laughed and then forgot about it ten seconds later."
5519,Gabrielle,"then you better think of another way to get my pictures back.because if you don't,people on wisteria lane are gonna be seeing a lot more of me!ralph,luis,feast your eyes!"
5116,Gabrielle,you're supposed to be in love with me.
8352,Gabrielle,it's all part of being the president's wife. so tell me about your new hire. she's gonna be your number two?
6430,Gabrielle,"i hate that you know me so well, and it took so long for that to happen. now i have to start over again with somebody else."
7291,Gabrielle,"oh, no. they did?"
6712,Gabrielle,"sorry, no poker today. lynette had to work. want a margarita?"
8281,Gabrielle,"why? so you can go get another ""haircut""?"
5635,Gabrielle,"maybe,but you don't know her like i do."
6019,Gabrielle,"guest, carlos. i said guest."
6917,Gabrielle,jumping up and down and hugging me.
5288,Gabrielle,aah!
5148,Gabrielle,only if it ends with me getting what i want.
6505,Gabrielle,you bribed the judges?
6475,Gabrielle,thank you. oh.
7692,Gabrielle,"oh, don't make me pull out the solis family photo album. it's like a bunch of sea lions posing on a rock."
7925,Gabrielle,what is your problem?
7843,Gabrielle,her place makes the best pizza in town.
8617,Gabrielle,"well, then what the hell happened? this doesn't make sense. i was at your house. you had such lovely things."
8116,Gabrielle,"oh, yes, i will. my rage is fueling me in ways you can't imagine."
8025,Gabrielle,"can you see me, babe?"
7048,Gabrielle,"oh, no cream for me, thanks."
8477,Gabrielle,so are we ready for this?
5782,Gabrielle,"ahh.oh,and xiao-mei,mr. solis does not need to know about this,okay?"
5041,Gabrielle,"you knew the one thing i didn't want was a child, and you still tricked me into getting pregnant!"
5564,Gabrielle,"uh, depends.what have you heard?"
4308,Gabrielle,"you know, juanita, this is so like you. i take you on a nice shopping trip and you find ways to upset me."
8645,Gabrielle,"no, i'm thinking about our children. they're so happy. taking in a kid we don't even know? that's a huge risk."
8255,Gabrielle,are you sure about that?
8555,Gabrielle,"i was in labor for 20 hours. she still owes me for that! fine. i will make the ultimate sacrifice, and i will be ugly for my daughter. but if she ever needs a kidney--"
4933,Gabrielle,what?
8438,Gabrielle,"say what you want about edie, she really understood men."
6693,Gabrielle,sorry. i wanted options. stop judging me. i was hopped up on couture.
6241,Gabrielle,"no,i mean it.the rage that i have felt in these past six months--if i had had a gun in the courthouse today--"
5886,Gabrielle,"fine. i'll learn to live without product.but when my hair starts smelling like hair,i don't wanna hear a word."
6306,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't know."
5835,Gabrielle,"no,you can't go!you can't--you can't take her!you can't take her! no!she's our baby!she's our--no!please!"
8226,Gabrielle,"okay, be honest. here i come. so what do you think?"
7363,Gabrielle,is it? i'd forgotten.
5020,Gabrielle,stop it!
8467,Gabrielle,why? don't tell me you're depressed because you lost some stupid game.
8474,Gabrielle,now come on. let's go to my house. let's pop open a bottle of wine and toast to our future.
5308,Gabrielle,"well, let's get you another round."
8121,Gabrielle,it's your children. they've run amok.
6728,Gabrielle,look. no gloves.
6197,Gabrielle,"carlos, could you come help me?"
6101,Gabrielle,"i mean, that's how bunny connors got chlamydia."
7340,Gabrielle,"edie, what have you got there?! oh, crap!"
6468,Gabrielle,"wait, wait, wait. first rule of ransackingremember where everything goes."
5928,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei, do you have a second?this is probably silly, but it's been bothering me.when you said,""please don't kill him,"" did you mean carlos?"
8511,Gabrielle,"""oh, tom, what big arms you have""--that kind of talking?"
5107,Gabrielle,"let me count the ways. um, gently, savagely, frequently, upside down--"
8208,Gabrielle,okay. we need to talk.
4596,Gabrielle,"i'm the one who was sleeping with your son.but, helen, it's over now."
7963,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! that woman is crazy."
4684,Gabrielle,"well, i'm not interested in becoming one of your friends. get out of my bedroom."
4996,Gabrielle,"well, you sort of are."
5061,Gabrielle,why would he think you have that kind of money?
7300,Gabrielle,"okay, if we just stay lm and stick to the story--"
5776,Gabrielle,every 40 minutes? when am i supposed to have a life?
4400,Gabrielle,"well, as it turns out, pershing modeling academy has an opening for their summer program. would you like me to sponsor you?"
4438,Gabrielle,why would you say that?
5224,Gabrielle,you're not gonna eat?
6305,Gabrielle,"well, you guys earned it. but eat fast, because we only have one hour left, and i want to introduce you to your new best friend, mr. spray tan."
4406,Gabrielle,bree--
5506,Gabrielle,"scott's web site,with pictures of me on it.well,say something."
8111,Gabrielle,"hey, what did i say about that kind of language?"
6217,Gabrielle,i'm gonna have to call you back.
4362,Gabrielle,isn't it sexist of us to generalize like this?
4928,Gabrielle,i am pregnant and it is all your fault.
8018,Gabrielle,"no, i'm talking about me. i may have lost my luster."
7157,Gabrielle,"good work, boys, but i have to head out in a few minutes, so make sure you put all the stuff back in the garage. hello?"
6513,Gabrielle,"wow, you have your own recording studio in your house?"
5419,Gabrielle,i'm concerned about the drought in kenya.
6337,Gabrielle,do not wimp out on me here. we gotta do what's best for the business.
8589,Gabrielle,who told you that?
5032,Gabrielle,"no, okay. that was a stretch. i'm sorry. carlos, wait! come back. look, i wanna start over. we're gonna have a baby. isn't that what you always wanted? carlos, wait! i said i was sorry and i love you! what more do you want?"
8399,Gabrielle,how about a quickie?
8012,Gabrielle,no. we don't accept charity.
5699,Gabrielle,yeah. when did they stop hating each other?
7588,Gabrielle,what are you doing?
5666,Gabrielle,"well,as long as they don't make me play guitar,i think we're home free."
4256,Gabrielle,her real name?
7382,Gabrielle,excuse me. are you al's wife? i'm gabrielle lang.
4863,Gabrielle,"no no, keep going."
4776,Gabrielle,"eyes front, padre."
6266,Gabrielle,i've got some wardrobe choices. i want to be buried in this dress!
7513,Gabrielle,"carlos, no!"
4761,Gabrielle,"well, i'm saying your mother was a sensible woman. she wouldn't be comfortable with all these bells and whistles. maybe this one. wood veneer!"
6931,Gabrielle,"well, i gotta go. i'm gonna meet francois."
5157,Gabrielle,are you hitting on me?
5380,Gabrielle,it's a joke. lighten up.
5043,Gabrielle,"no, we're not."
8644,Gabrielle,so what's one more? they'll never know the difference.
7129,Gabrielle,"but you could be, which brings me to my second point--men like variety. tonight you're a redhead. tomorrow--you are--helga, the sexy milkmaid. or--amber, the lonely runaway. or--jeff, the friendly guy from work. what? i don't know what tom is into."
8652,Gabrielle,brought you a laundry basket. you need me to show you how to use the washer? it's my clever way of saying you're gonna be doing your own laundry.
7721,Gabrielle,"she called us ""staff""?"
7776,Gabrielle,are you suggesting that juanita is fat for her age?
6607,Gabrielle,"hey,i am looking out for zach,too.if i dump him,it'll destroy him emotionally.better to scare him off. please?"
4255,Gabrielle,it's so weird to hear mary alice.
7408,Gabrielle,carlos! i have a priest with me.
6663,Gabrielle,"oh, shut up and get me a sweater. have you even noticed how cold i am?"
5378,Gabrielle,currently? no.
6474,Gabrielle,is it?
7654,Gabrielle,"i just found $118,000 in ellie's teddy bear."
6562,Gabrielle,"yeah. that isn't a problem, is it? 'cause this is what friends do. they talk about each other's dates."
6082,Gabrielle,don't laugh.i saved a bundle on airfare.
7342,Gabrielle,oh!
4175,Gabrielle,turns out i wanted all the wrong things.
8558,Gabrielle,i'm not ill. i'm just not wearing any makeup so i can teach my daughter that beauty's what's on the inside. i don't actually look this hideous.
6813,Gabrielle,lynette! susan!
6750,Gabrielle,do i look like the maid? give me that!
8193,Gabrielle,"ah, yeah. times are good. not for her. her, mrs. mccluskey said something about you losing 5 pounds in one day. how'd you do that?"
7611,Gabrielle,"okay, when this thing is over, let's not do the whole christmas card thing."
8061,Gabrielle,wow! neat! why don't you guys go wash your hands for lunch?
4938,Gabrielle,i feel a wave of morning sickness coming on and i want to be standing on your mother's grave when it hits.
5149,Gabrielle,excuse me?
7577,Gabrielle,"you know, i've been hitting you a lot less lately, and i don't feel like i'm getting enough credit for that."
7178,Gabrielle,"seriously, john, you have got to get out of here."
6338,Gabrielle,then i will jump in and defend you.
4897,Gabrielle,"yes, yes, i know. my husband and i went through a downsizing phase. but we've snapped out of it. life is good. and this would make it so much better."
4566,Gabrielle,"well, we're not negotiating my uterus."
6036,Gabrielle,"not now, xiao-mei!"
4856,Gabrielle,"well, then have fun at the motel."
6026,Gabrielle,who the hell are you anyway? and why the hell are you at this wedding?
7768,Gabrielle,"okay, i-i can't drive around avoiding gravity and the sun."
6973,Gabrielle,fine. i get it. but why would i want a husband who values his father's opinion more than mine?
7209,Gabrielle,hold on. this check is dated for next year.
5088,Gabrielle,i just realized rita and i have a lot in common.
5296,Gabrielle,"carlos, what happened?"
7250,Gabrielle,"for god sakes, carlos, am i gonna have to change this number?"
7387,Gabrielle,which is--
5008,Gabrielle,there's no way i'm dressing him.
7975,Gabrielle,"virginia, they're happy where they are. they love fairview. besides, greenbrier's, like, an hour away."
4282,Gabrielle,oh! okay.
7770,Gabrielle,"okay, you know what? that's it. i wanna talk to your mother."
5310,Gabrielle,"no, it's not cool! who the hell are you?"
4160,Gabrielle,why??
8244,Gabrielle,like a great jumping off point.
7653,Gabrielle,"over here, carlos."
6231,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm helping you pack. think of all the money you're gonna save on bubble wrap."
7007,Gabrielle,new neighbors.what do we know?
6553,Gabrielle,"oh, that'll happen a lot faster if you just hop on board."
4986,Gabrielle,"the prescription was dated, carlos, and juanita was in a coma when this claim was filed. you did this, not your mother. at least be man enough to own up to it. she would've been."
4782,Gabrielle,"this is too much. the only reason i agreed to give up the house is because i thought i was gonna get a gorgeous little apartment. now, i'm not even going to get that!"
7424,Gabrielle,it's a new recipe for beef stew. i think you're gonna love it.
6583,Gabrielle,"ah, that's so sweet--but it's a lie. every tick of the clock takes away something. zach, what am i gonna do when i'm not pretty anymore?"
5367,Gabrielle,you're up early.
6638,Gabrielle,"no, thank you. i'm stuffed."
5837,Gabrielle,the people from carlos' church.
5916,Gabrielle,"honey, they didn't know all the details, but a witness said that they saw you run into the carpool lane to pick up a lawn chair that had fallen off some truck, and then a bus hit you right in front of the road crew.why aren't you at the road crew?"
5594,Gabrielle,mnh-mnh.hmm.
5640,Gabrielle,so? how did it go?
7126,Gabrielle,"okay, not smart."
4158,Gabrielle,"i found my earrings, we can go now."
4896,Gabrielle,we made a deal. no kids.
4891,Gabrielle,"oh, you've heard it all before. girl meets boy. boy buys girl nice things. girl leaves happy."
6204,Gabrielle,sure. why not? for old time's sake.
5417,Gabrielle,"she may wear a habit and the beads, but at the end of the day, she is still a woman, just like me, and i know what i'm capable of."
4542,Gabrielle,you don't think she is--
4725,Gabrielle,"god, i have to go to the bathroom again."
8530,Gabrielle,hey.
6790,Gabrielle,what kind of woman would keep her husband's body in the freezer?
8643,Gabrielle,"well, luckily, it's a big family. let her go live with nina and luis."
6214,Gabrielle,you are a bastard!
6962,Gabrielle,"victor, ever since we met, it's been photo ops and fund-raisers, and i'm sick of it."
7707,Gabrielle,"no, carlos. i mean--sometimes i'm glad you can't see me. five years and two kids and no time for facials or the gym. it just-- takes a toll. and when edie same the other day, it was like she didn't even recognize me."
4921,Gabrielle,"i think i can honestly say, no, i'm not."
4915,Gabrielle,"you couldn't wait to throw that in, could you? look, god is screwing with me! he doesn't like the way i live my life, so he's punishing me."
7914,Gabrielle,"gosh, that's a--a hell of a sweet offer, but i've--got the girls, and, um--"
6961,Gabrielle,"oh. okay, well, let's explore it now. nope, not gonna happen."
4918,Gabrielle,i don't have time for this crap. i have a party to plan.
7747,Gabrielle,"oh, come on. it's already priced way below blue book, not to mention it's mint."
8648,Gabrielle,why would i be nervous?
5851,Gabrielle,"oh,well,it would be our baby.it would just be growing inside of you."
8319,Gabrielle,"well, at least be man enough to tell maria, because if you don't, i will."
5903,Gabrielle,"no! men can't help it.when they become fathers,they become lousy husbands,and some wives don't mind,but you didn't marry one of those women."
4194,Gabrielle,stop.
5678,Gabrielle,"there are ways to get babies, carlos."
8290,Gabrielle,"yes, he wants me to take maria shopping tomorrow."
8321,Gabrielle,i'm so sorry.
7314,Gabrielle,"well, you can stop feeling guilty. victor's alive, and we're screwed."
7574,Gabrielle,"well, i suppose i could look the other way for a few months. it's the least i could do for thinking you're a whore. forgive me?"
5392,Gabrielle,she can wait five minutes. we're giving her a car.
6068,Gabrielle,nothing. i just-- i can't get over how mature and confident you are. you've really changed.
4210,Gabrielle,"well, you know what you need to do. you need to get there early, spend a little time with mike before little barracuda gets there."
4258,Gabrielle,so what the hell do we do now?
8296,Gabrielle,you didn't.
4293,Gabrielle,"i'll tell you who wasn't giving mixed signals, was that sexy officer thompson.he was staring at you all night."
7256,Gabrielle,"no, i'm good."
7206,Gabrielle,"oh, great. now i have to break up with him all over again."
6299,Gabrielle,"remember, eyes forward, shoulders back, hips square. look left, look right, whip and walk. yes, i'm unbelievable. close your mouths."
6459,Gabrielle,"that's very sweet of you, but i am not the most beautiful woman in the world."
6314,Gabrielle,"but before they do, they kill your appetite. one time, there was a girl who took too many laxatives, and, uh--well, if you're ever at the chateau milan in room two thirty-eight, do not use the jacuzzi."
7166,Gabrielle,okay. so-- are you guys staying here?
6989,Gabrielle,"i can't dump him on our wedding day.that's a horrible thing to do,even to victor."
5830,Gabrielle,"carlos!no!carlos, what's happening?"
6812,Gabrielle,"hey, lynette, it's gaby. victor got pulled into some photo op at the homeless shelter. so i'm free for lunch.you wanna go with? i tried susan but she's not home, which is weird because her car's in the driveway and--so is yours. where is everybody?"
5810,Gabrielle,you're trying to take our baby!how is it not gonna be ugly?
5192,Gabrielle,"i don't want a new lawyer. i want you. so does carlos, he just doesn't realize it yet."
6507,Gabrielle,no. absolutely not.
5473,Gabrielle,"oh.so i know susan mayer would never tell.it must've been helen rowland.she probably blabbed to all the girls at the salon.and ida greenberg goes to that salon.so if ida knows,the whole town knows.and we're just gonna have to move. that's all there is to it.carlos, can you stop putting for two seconds and show me some support?"
6528,Gabrielle,what the hell are you doing?!
6395,Gabrielle,really? i only counted half that.
6223,Gabrielle,you can stop now.
7452,Gabrielle,i'm poor now. remember? i have to mingle with the unwashed masses. what are you doing here?
5231,Gabrielle,yeah. why not?
5511,Gabrielle,"and i would love to,but i have the upper body strength of a kitten.i need a brute!"
4335,Gabrielle,"yes, apparently they found a blouse in her bag-oh, i don't know, carlos. at some point older people just start to get confused. she probably thought she paid for it. no. no charges."
4751,Gabrielle,"oh my god! honey, that means we can keep the house!"
6104,Gabrielle,no! but i would hire someone to beat the crap out of him.
6584,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna take a little nap, okay? just for a minute."
5227,Gabrielle,for what?
5659,Gabrielle,"yeah,that was a good trip."
6252,Gabrielle,"well, i fell in love, got married and moved to the suburbs for the whole fairy-tale happy ending thing. that was a crock."
7202,Gabrielle,"hello? hey, carlos. yeah, i can't talk right now. i'm breaking up with victor. no, he's not here. he's in washington. yeah, okay, i'll explain later."
7961,Gabrielle,delightful. now leave before there's a terrible misunderstanding between my foot and your ass.
8069,Gabrielle,"good, good. i don't know if you heard-carlos got his sight back."
8335,Gabrielle,okay.
8512,Gabrielle,"okay, great. now if you'll excuse me have to get back to my gardening."
7278,Gabrielle,"it was self-defense, right? i mean, he was trying to kill us."
7500,Gabrielle,"no, it's crystal clear. carlos gets a new best friend, and i get to check the sofa for ticks. yay for gaby!"
6905,Gabrielle,"and getting married is scary, but at least we'll be doing it together. oh, my god! we should totally do that!"
5856,Gabrielle,"mm hmm.well,if we are so friggin' close,what's the big deal?it's nine months out of your life."
5163,Gabrielle,"no, susan, come on. zach attacked felicia. he, he blew up your kitchen. evidently he tried to kill mike. we can all agree this kid's a freak!"
7959,Gabrielle,"well, maybe that's because the last time we spoke, you called me a greedy bitch, and i called you a scary old hag."
4278,Gabrielle,carlos found this under the bed.
5355,Gabrielle,what happened?
7618,Gabrielle,that's for using your tongue.
8574,Gabrielle,"you know, for a woman who has a purse full of dinner rolls, you sure have a lot of attitude."
7015,Gabrielle,"yeah,well,i--kind of thought about you,too."
6353,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, it's totally my fault. i'm sorry, sweetie. go outside and do it again. i promise this time we're gonna watch."
8676,Gabrielle,"and the teenager has finally arrived. ana, listen. we want you to be part of this family. we will love you and support you and take care of you, but in exchange, you will show us a little bit of respect and obey our rules, which means doing your own chores, no boys in the house and no more gifts from men."
6694,Gabrielle,"what? over a dress? god, what a bi*ch."
5898,Gabrielle,"yeah, sure,knock yourself out."
8576,Gabrielle,"hey. i know i disappointed you tonight, and i'm really sorry."
5770,Gabrielle,"yeah,you should go."
8143,Gabrielle,"wow! jimmy choo! oh, carlos! these aren't even in the states yet. what's the catch?"
8214,Gabrielle,don't take that tone with me. i am paying.
6059,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm sorry."
4726,Gabrielle,i've been to bree's twice today.
4480,Gabrielle,could have fooled me.
5278,Gabrielle,hi!
7499,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry. i was on my hands and knees that day, scouring the bathroom floor because you refused to pee like a girl."
5096,Gabrielle,you know me.
4415,Gabrielle,i love long good byes.
7977,Gabrielle,excuse me. you don't get to insist on anything when it comes to my daughters.
5475,Gabrielle,"you're enjoying this,aren't you?punishing me, dangling the affair over my head?well,i won't tolerate it."
6825,Gabrielle,i didn't plan it that way. it was spur of the moment.
6538,Gabrielle,"forget about it.give a horny kid a couple million bucks and the yellow pages,and stuff is gonna happen."
8105,Gabrielle,"uh, wait, you're moving?"
4307,Gabrielle,here we go.
7475,Gabrielle,i don't believe this. i was worried sick about you!
7208,Gabrielle,"milton, there is no amount of money that is-- wow!"
7323,Gabrielle,what?
8297,Gabrielle,"well, shaylait is shayla, right?"
4930,Gabrielle,look! it's been pulled apart and glued back together.
5293,Gabrielle,"well, i'll tell you what, since it's my schedule that seems to be the problem, why don't i just figure out a time and call you?"
7423,Gabrielle,"yes, sweetheart. i'm in the kitchen making dinner."
8009,Gabrielle,"okay, i didn't wanna have to say this, but you should never have surgery on a friday. the surgeons are thinking about the weekend. they're all distracted. next thing you know, you come out of the o.r. still blind and missing your right leg."
6274,Gabrielle,"ready, ready!"
7858,Gabrielle,i'm pregnant!
6707,Gabrielle,your speech--i liked it.
4344,Gabrielle,mama solis. what are you doing here?
7762,Gabrielle,wh--will you at least have it washed?
6752,Gabrielle,no! fifty thousand dollars? are you insane?!
5112,Gabrielle,"well, someone had to tend to the yard. you were busy elsewhere."
5416,Gabrielle,she wants us fighting. she wants you to get tired of me and walk out so she can have you all to herself.
7162,Gabrielle,"boys, time to get paid."
6142,Gabrielle,"really? well, that's weird. when?"
6738,Gabrielle,"oh, man, i was just starting to get into it."
6344,Gabrielle,after the harsh things you said about amy? i don't think so.
7529,Gabrielle,"i'm not sure. why don't i go look? huh. no. oh, wow. it's the scavo dog--way down in their yard. i guess it's true - lose one sense, all the others get heightened. okay, you get that. i'm gonna go find your dog."
7434,Gabrielle,leave you? do you really think i'm that shallow?
8650,Gabrielle,"yeah, when i think about everything that little girl's been through--her dad walked out, her mother's in jail, the way she bounced from relative to relative--i just want this to be the end of the line for her."
6741,Gabrielle,they're just toaster waffles.
5016,Gabrielle,"anyway, he was placed under house arrest, and he being the jealous man that he is, got a little crazy every time i left the house."
6883,Gabrielle,susan. hi.
8052,Gabrielle,right. damn.
6570,Gabrielle,guess someone's in a hurry to get on with the evening.
8067,Gabrielle,"yeah, yeah. i'm comin'."
8248,Gabrielle,"absolutely. now if you'll excuse me, i'll leave you two to business. all this negotiating just goes right over my head."
5300,Gabrielle,"no, i'm good."
7547,Gabrielle,"honey, i can't find my nail file. have you seen it?"
5421,Gabrielle,"well, bon voyage, father."
8456,Gabrielle,"oh, edie, don't take it personally. we're just different types."
7124,Gabrielle,what?
7473,Gabrielle,"thank you. sorry, babe. that took a little longer than i--carlos? carlos? carlos? carlos! carlos! oh, there you are."
8609,Gabrielle,she never missed bingo night at immaculate heart-- and she was lutheran.
5463,Gabrielle,"tom, i need to wipe up.do you have a towel?"
7380,Gabrielle,"hi. um, i'm a friend of al's, and i was wondering if i could see him."
4317,Gabrielle,"but i thought teenage girls bored you, john? i thought what we had was beyond that."
8475,Gabrielle,isn't that weird? she knew she was gonna die young.
7606,Gabrielle,and--she's gone.
8240,Gabrielle,"oh, will you excuse me a minute?"
6947,Gabrielle,"which is why i have to show people that i'm okay with it. please, just consider it my wedding gift."
4734,Gabrielle,"carlos, i have to go."
7538,Gabrielle,"yeah, come on in. so because of my husband's disability, our financial situation has changed, and we have this big house."
6335,Gabrielle,we'll do it together. we'll be very diplomatic.
8176,Gabrielle,"watch out, ladies."
5822,Gabrielle,"who's the pretty girl?oh, looks like it's daddy's turn."
6568,Gabrielle,"just finish your soup, and we'll get naked."
8599,Gabrielle,"me either. my daughter's gotten so snooty, i am forcing her to spend time with the great unwashed. you wanna ditch this place for a cappuccino?"
8119,Gabrielle,"celia! juanita! i am not gonna ask you again to pick up these clothes! you've got till the count of three! one-- two-- three! you can hear me, right?"
7853,Gabrielle,"i am so sick of everybody looking at the glass half-full. the glass is empty, people, and so is our bank account."
8354,Gabrielle,you told me you slept with her.
4711,Gabrielle,how will you work?
4967,Gabrielle,really? i've been finding it so bland.
6428,Gabrielle,i know. so just admit you sent the flowers.
8625,Gabrielle,"cause that's what grown-ups do, sweetie. when we don't like someone, we don't punch them or say mean things. we just find subtle ways to make them feel bad about their lives. ooh, like these earrings, aunt connie can't afford them, and that'll make her sad. and this will bring her to her knees. and this will be a kick in her throat."
4620,Gabrielle,"i guess. i understand if, uh, you hate me just a little."
7366,Gabrielle,"okay, i made a mistake. i'm sorry, but victor wasn't entirely blameless. he ignored me. he used me politically. oh, yeah, and he tried to kill carlos. so i think i'm entitled to whatever he had."
7114,Gabrielle,now or before tonight?
5426,Gabrielle,huh?
5279,Gabrielle,bree? it's gabby!
8686,Gabrielle,what? that the card was cancelled by my lover's mommy?
6897,Gabrielle,"honey, i am so sorry. i hope you don't hate me."
6452,Gabrielle,he's here.
6074,Gabrielle,"except now when we're done, i don't have to proofread your essay on ethan frome'."
5557,Gabrielle,"no, we've had our differences,but that doesn't mean i'm happy to see you shipped off to alaska.brr."
5739,Gabrielle,so you think bree punched andrew in the face?'cause i don't.
7748,Gabrielle,"okay, this car goes zero to 60 in 5 seconds. by the time someone says, ""wow, a ding,"" you're in the next county."
8423,Gabrielle,i forgot these were in the nightstand. this is gonna be fun.
7535,Gabrielle,we're fine. this is who we are. this is our relationship.
5137,Gabrielle,he called me a bitch.
7924,Gabrielle,"why not? i mean, look at this place. it's like shangri-la."
7722,Gabrielle,"no! it's not just one party! it's the kickoff to the whole social season. if people see we're off michelle's list, then we'll be off everyone's. and then it's gonna be the start of our slow slide from gowns and galas to flip-flops and keggers! okay, if carlos working at the club is the problem, then tell her he just quit."
7154,Gabrielle,i say we keep smiling and look for the hidden cameras. i think we're about to get punk'd.
4664,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. do i know you?
5954,Gabrielle,"forget the hotel, carlos.get a lease."
7789,Gabrielle,"susan, it's not your fault."
5277,Gabrielle,bree.
5013,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, if you can swing that one, more power to you."
4895,Gabrielle,"no, i'm just pointing something out. i'm a pretty girl. and pretty girls are never lonely."
7347,Gabrielle,"oh, now you're moral all of a sudden? you didn't care where the money was coming from when you thought carlos was gonna spend it on you!"
8422,Gabrielle,"now listen up, the pair of you. i haven't been sitting around in butt floss all night for my health. you're putting out. that's more like it!"
8341,Gabrielle,"well, how many seconds did the kiss last?"
4605,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry. i, i'm so sorry, i just can't handle this right now. i have my own personal things going on. my life is falling apart."
5094,Gabrielle,hey--
7941,Gabrielle,i--don't think that's such a good idea.
6193,Gabrielle,"oh! oh, sweetie!"
6233,Gabrielle,what? what are you gonna do?
5732,Gabrielle,"i'm thinking $12,000."
8632,Gabrielle,say no more.
5388,Gabrielle,"no, i mean it. i'm sorry. i wanna be a better person, too. i'm sick of being bad. forgive me?"
6261,Gabrielle,"look, marcella, i'm back. and we made such a great team before, and i think we can be again."
5101,Gabrielle,you are clearly determined to ruin this special day for us.
8256,Gabrielle,"well, ice is solid too, until it cracks and you're drowning in freezing water. i'd stay in counseling if i were you."
4796,Gabrielle,"honey, are you okay?"
5737,Gabrielle,"well,you take care now."
8654,Gabrielle,this teenager thing isn't so bad.
7153,Gabrielle,what the hell is it?
8444,Gabrielle,"yeah, i do. i spent a night with her right after carlos and i got divorced."
6975,Gabrielle,"he blew off eighty million dollars? well, if he cares about me so damn much, why am i not hearing this from him?"
4627,Gabrielle,"honestly, no. john, you're a toy. a sweet, dumb toy, so you might as well go to college, because you and me, no future!"
5877,Gabrielle,absolutely. you have nothing to worry about here.
4963,Gabrielle,what the hell are you????
6672,Gabrielle,i just wanted a moment to say good-bye.
7663,Gabrielle,"yes, officer. i see you. thank you for coming. now remember, ellie's dangerous. so if she shows up, feel free to use excessive force."
4208,Gabrielle,so now you're taking julie on your dinner date with mike?
7018,Gabrielle,what?
8142,Gabrielle,i just wanted us to have a normal life.
8159,Gabrielle,"no, no, it's cute. it's cute. i get that. it's just-- i was a top-tier fashion model, and i guess i'm just gonna have to get used to the fact that the best part of my life is behind me. good-bye doi vod shots with kate moss, and hello to sipping international coffee with you girls. full house."
6297,Gabrielle,"hey, girls, let's talk beauty."
6781,Gabrielle,"hi, edie!"
6903,Gabrielle,"honey, please. if anyone should be nervous, it's me. i met victor three months ago. i mean, i'm crazy about him. it's just, the thought of saying those vows again? that's scary."
4948,Gabrielle,john! what are you doing?
8162,Gabrielle,really?
7115,Gabrielle,"look, i know you're upset."
7225,Gabrielle,"no, i'm serious. after everything i have been through? no! no, get out!"
7697,Gabrielle,you sure? running around in the sun and fresh air would make you feel good.
5011,Gabrielle,"when the baby cries in the middle of the night, you're gonna get up without saying one word. doctors' appointments: you're driving. i'm not putting a car seat in my maserati. and you will also be on bottle duty. that means washing, sterilizing, and filling. that way i'll have some semblance of a life, and then maybe i won't hate you so much."
7815,Gabrielle,"can i ask why? i mean, you can't see it."
6405,Gabrielle,"you need to move on, carlos."
5051,Gabrielle,"i'm getting really tired of this song, carlos. isn't it about time you forgave me?"
4657,Gabrielle,"you must be loving this, huh? having me serve you must be a dream come true."
5372,Gabrielle,"so, she's hot! she's a hot nun!"
8413,Gabrielle,really?
7917,Gabrielle,"oh, lap of luxury, how i've missed sitting in you."
6673,Gabrielle,"hi. remember me? i had dinner here the other night. anyway, i was driving through your neighborhood after having, like, three iced teas, and i really have to go to the bathroom. do you mind?"
8042,Gabrielle,what?
4521,Gabrielle,"yao lin, your kids are in their twenties. if it'll make you shut up--"
7936,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah."
5792,Gabrielle,bree--i'm so sorry i'm late.
5818,Gabrielle,"no, no, no.i am not letting that idiot use my baby as a bargaining chip."
4337,Gabrielle,"okay, suit yourself."
5484,Gabrielle,okay.
5007,Gabrielle,"i'm here to testify for you, carlos. can you take those off?"
8490,Gabrielle,dave? hello? dave? he didn't answer.
7830,Gabrielle,excuse me?
5309,Gabrielle,"ahhh! oh, my god! what do you want?"
5344,Gabrielle,"if it was a boy, i was gonna name it charlie."
5981,Gabrielle,"it was banter!i mean, has this country come to the point where you can't joke with the help?"
6748,Gabrielle,he's not here. is that for him?
8439,Gabrielle,"okay, my hour's up. someone else hold edie now."
7029,Gabrielle,"yeah. unfortunately, it's my sweat. when are you gonna dump her?"
8494,Gabrielle,that's a bit that i never get tired of.
8317,Gabrielle,deal's over. i'm not covering for your stupid little fling anymore.
5483,Gabrielle,"oh, whatever,close enough."
5264,Gabrielle,"well, try harder."
6547,Gabrielle,"there will be no celebration. i'm turning thirty-one. i'm a single woman in her thirties. i now have to subscribe to ""cat fancy."" it's the law."
6115,Gabrielle,can't be too safe. you never know when someone might move in on you when you're not looking.
4162,Gabrielle,"i'm not feeling the grass! let's just get going, come on! we're late!"
7238,Gabrielle,that's amazing. where should we go?
8448,Gabrielle,we're an unstoppable team.
5376,Gabrielle,"so sister mary, tell me what's it like meeting men in prison. do you bond with all the convicts or was carlos just special?"
7509,Gabrielle,"oh, so now i can't hit my own husband in my own house?"
6391,Gabrielle,i'm gonna hang up now.
4581,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know. the feds towed away my maserati. my husband is, is a felon, and i spend my days getting groped by fat tracker salesmen at trade shows. i am well aware things change!"
8085,Gabrielle,"it was tom scavo, wasn't it?"
4147,Gabrielle,is your finger ok?
5139,Gabrielle,"not just for me. for us. in case you haven't noticed, carlos, our marriage is still on shaky ground."
7849,Gabrielle,"i don't care. oh, sorry. it's just--mommy really misses her friend, and mommy's gonna be really sad if her friend doesn't show up soon. now go downstairs and play. mommy has some praying to do."
7283,Gabrielle,"carlos, why are you calling me? i told you we can't be seen together."
8097,Gabrielle,"so, bradley, if carlos were to come work for you, what would a typical week look like?"
6083,Gabrielle,don't you mean her daddy will buy her a new one and just launder the money through you?
7488,Gabrielle,how do you know that?
5673,Gabrielle,"well,then who the hell does?i mean,look at all the idiots popping kids.okay,they're not any more qualified than we are."
8663,Gabrielle,"yeah. okay, well--don't take this the wrong way, but that's not exactly from the versace virgin line."
6793,Gabrielle,"but once they defrost the body and do an autopsy, i guarantee you they're gonna find a bellyful of arsenic."
5358,Gabrielle,wow. that biting thing at the end totally blew my mind. please tell me you didn't learn that in prison.
7659,Gabrielle,money? what money?
8673,Gabrielle,"uh, okay, juanita, go to your room. and don't come out until you're 18."
6033,Gabrielle,now look what you've done!
6404,Gabrielle,"oh, you care.first,you move across the street.and then, earlier today,i catch you spying on me--"
4665,Gabrielle,"really, why?"
7613,Gabrielle,"oh, ellie! hey!"
4660,Gabrielle,he was shot? how could you not tell us about this?
7669,Gabrielle,"aah! carlos! carlos, don't just stand there! go get help!"
5115,Gabrielle,"i know you're friends, and i have a hunch you don't do to your friends what i saw you doing to that wrinkly old lady."
5164,Gabrielle,"yes, we got it. uh, we interrupt our lovemaking to answer the phone or you call out the dogs."
8175,Gabrielle,"oh, it's only temporary. juanita needed her coloring book back."
4145,Gabrielle,john. we have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.
4455,Gabrielle,i know.
5749,Gabrielle,it was all worth it.
4838,Gabrielle,"huh, you moved the money?"
5637,Gabrielle,"because--she knew exactly what was going on with alejandro,and she chose to look the other way."
7894,Gabrielle,"and so what if he fires you? once virginia tells all of her rich lady friends about what you did for her, they'll be lining up around the block."
8622,Gabrielle,we're going to a family reunion at aunt connie' and i want to look my best.
4589,Gabrielle,"uh, uh, uh! mmmm. mmmm. you're the man of the house? you can't even leave it!"
7935,Gabrielle,"oh, that's okay."
4754,Gabrielle,i think that's pretty reasonable considering you're guilty as sin!
7739,Gabrielle,thank you. mm-hmm.
5263,Gabrielle,"i have to fit in this, so for god's sakes, put some muscle into it."
5849,Gabrielle,"uh-- well,there's just one little thing--the immigration laws have gotten really tough in this country,so we're a little behind the eight ball going in.but we pled your case,and we fought tooth and nail,and the law says you can stay--but only if you have our baby."
7572,Gabrielle,you've been running a tattoo parlor out of my house?
5183,Gabrielle,"why not? he's experienced, he's intelligent, he's successful."
7876,Gabrielle,"get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch."
4488,Gabrielle,"i have some not-so-awesome news, so you go first."
4817,Gabrielle,and when you get out we're going to have money to start over with. thanks to me.
7327,Gabrielle,oh. right. it's nice.
7863,Gabrielle,"oh, cram it, you fertile freak. you're getting a vasectomy."
5281,Gabrielle,"it was, um, weird."
7000,Gabrielle,no!i would rather try and work it out with victor.
4717,Gabrielle,"okay, well, we'll let you know."
7685,Gabrielle,"oh, you know what? we should have a dinner or something."
4974,Gabrielle,"so, how's your roommate doing?"
6922,Gabrielle,that's your problem?
4387,Gabrielle,"of course i would, why wouldn't i?"
8537,Gabrielle,"well, for the record, you're growing on me. you know what? i'm thirsty. let's start a book club."
6058,Gabrielle,yeah?
5255,Gabrielle,"luckily, the judge dropped the hate crime charge. so now all carlos has to do is serve out the slave labor thing. he'll be out in six months."
5883,Gabrielle,all of it?even my hair pomade?
8684,Gabrielle,"oh no, i'm just at the grocery store wondering if i should buy a ticket. thanks a bunch, mr. hartley. so what time should i bring carlos to the da's office tomorrow? great."
6336,Gabrielle,"amy! for god sakes, little miss snowflake does not scratch down there!"
6268,Gabrielle,"excuse me, durkin?"
4560,Gabrielle,i guess i got too close to the turn table. i'm a sucker for these buicks.
5369,Gabrielle,but it's not even sunday.
7882,Gabrielle,"and until we get a box of condoms in that house, that's all you're gettin'."
4368,Gabrielle,now give me a boost.
5872,Gabrielle,excuse me. what?
4534,Gabrielle,we're not into clutter.
7010,Gabrielle,he's a cutie.what does he do?
5217,Gabrielle,has she seen paul yet?
4621,Gabrielle,"that's sweet, you're, you're very sweet."
7083,Gabrielle,she's got a ring!
5322,Gabrielle,excuse me?
8152,Gabrielle,"yeah. they came by, brought muffins. one of 'em wants her basket back."
6574,Gabrielle,is that your office?
5620,Gabrielle,"what i want is for you to lighten up.we don't have a lot of options, and you're gonna have to pick one."
5509,Gabrielle,i gave these pictures to him as a gift.he owns them.
7920,Gabrielle,what's to get ready? you buy a $9 sheet cake and fling a piata over a tree and bam! party time.
8429,Gabrielle,you think you can buy me off with presents?
6714,Gabrielle,that's toby. he's fixing my closet.
6624,Gabrielle,really? i think it's been nice.
6953,Gabrielle,"you gotta be kidding, right? i mean, we just finished a campaign. you're not about to put me through another one."
5015,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, i'm talking about his other crime."
5758,Gabrielle,that is after the baby is in.you have to connect it to the car first!i told you we should've got an s.u.v.!
8243,Gabrielle,"oh, i think i know the kind. so, brad--what sort of bonus are we looking at?"
6737,Gabrielle,"oh, god!"
6695,Gabrielle,she threatened me with mace and then slugged you. now you're on her side?
6657,Gabrielle,"apparently, the water heater in the attic had burst. everything is ruined. my clothes, my shoes, dresses. why are you smiling?"
8212,Gabrielle,"oh, that sounds so yummy. you got any?"
4413,Gabrielle,it's not those kind of cramps.
5268,Gabrielle,i don't care. i can't have these girls thinking i'm pregnant.
6651,Gabrielle,"no. god, no. as a matter of fact, i think i'm dumping him after dinner tonight."
6891,Gabrielle,"all right, ten thousand. i'm not gonna haggle."
6034,Gabrielle,"no, carlos!"
4381,Gabrielle,juanita!
6520,Gabrielle,"not quite. the day starts with lunch, and that kiss, off the table."
7359,Gabrielle,"oh. well, i'm still sorry, though."
4788,Gabrielle,why?
8029,Gabrielle,why aren't you wearing your blackout glasses? the doctor says your eyes can't be exposed to any light. i can only handle my husband going blind once per marriage.
6194,Gabrielle,"so go to ian! tell him you made the wrong choice, and he's the one you wanna be with. what have you got to lose?"
7390,Gabrielle,"why do people have to die?! why, god?! why? why? why? why? why?"
6729,Gabrielle,shouldn't there be an emergency light? sometimes in these elevators there's a. . .
8189,Gabrielle,that would be cheating. i'm gonna try to go pee again.
6797,Gabrielle,"we, you should, 'cause they do."
4879,Gabrielle,i ate already!
6990,Gabrielle,i was--just counting gifts.
7360,Gabrielle,aah! it's here.
8278,Gabrielle,"two. two.there's, uh, shayla the hairstylist and then there's this other shayla i know who's a home-wrecking whore."
6461,Gabrielle,he says i know him and that he wants to reintroduce himself at dinner.
4502,Gabrielle,"i do love him! i do! it's just complicated! you know, there's, there's got to be another way to fix this."
4998,Gabrielle,"i am not lying for you, carlos."
4610,Gabrielle,"oh, no. john. i, uh, i didn't come here for that."
6743,Gabrielle,we're having a good time. why risk ruining it?
5480,Gabrielle,"actually,i'm right in the middle of something,and i don't know when i'll be done."
7378,Gabrielle,"carlos, just calm down, okay? i'm sure al has an access code or a copy or some super nerd way to get back into the account, okay? i know we can fix this."
5764,Gabrielle,"oh,we just needed the one."
6579,Gabrielle,"i still got a lot of kick for an old broad, don't i?!"
5631,Gabrielle,i'm pulling out.watch your boobs.
5496,Gabrielle,"ralph,if this is about luis overwatering the hydrangeas again,i told you,no one likes a tattletale."
6664,Gabrielle,"sweater, now."
7447,Gabrielle,sorry i'm late. blind husband. you know the drill.
6829,Gabrielle,"well, i wanna look fabulous tonight when victor's elected mayor."
6371,Gabrielle,"what's wrong, sweetie?"
7597,Gabrielle,i can. she went after carlos and mike and karl. the only person she hasn't gone after is tom.
8250,Gabrielle,"uh, sure."
6348,Gabrielle,oh. it's nothing.
4377,Gabrielle,"i didn't realize how late it was. they're only holding the suede mini for me until two. if we stay, i'll never make it. we'll just have lunch at the mall."
4244,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, you'll be cruising so fast on this, no one will even notice. what? what's wrong?"
7095,Gabrielle,good point. mike! yes! let's get started.
6333,Gabrielle,"pageant consultants are judged on the strength of their roster. you know, we can't afford to bounce every nose-picking no-talent, but we can definitely lose the one who's dragging us down, and that's amy."
7066,Gabrielle,a charades party? didn't you just throw one?
5842,Gabrielle,"oh,my--this can't be happening."
5783,Gabrielle,okay.
4530,Gabrielle,"no, you don't understand. i have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things, and no one is going to take them away from me!"
7437,Gabrielle,"i know, but like i said, ""for better or for worse."""
6943,Gabrielle,i haven't gotten your reply card back yet. so chicken or fish?
7306,Gabrielle,crap!
5498,Gabrielle,why?
5222,Gabrielle,oh.
6816,Gabrielle,is that what our friendship is worth to you--twenty pizzas? we had a pact!
7965,Gabrielle,"right, and in exchange, when she finally kicks the bucket, we wind up with a lamp. i'm sorry, carlos."
4465,Gabrielle,"sure, no problem. there you go."
6280,Gabrielle,"oh, it was fine."
5569,Gabrielle,"and i need to know i'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with,not just some uterus in high heels."
6046,Gabrielle,i forgive you. it's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
7852,Gabrielle,"well, i hope to god you're right. and what does this number mean anyway?"
6042,Gabrielle,you and tom will survive this.
5246,Gabrielle,making my point. you don't love me.
8325,Gabrielle,i guess bradley told her.
4985,Gabrielle,"you see, your health insurance sent us a letter because someone ordered a year's worth of birth control pills, and apparently our policy doesn't cover drugs bought by the kilo."
5235,Gabrielle,"i feel terrible. how was i supposed to know that he would take a bullet and suddenly realize he's in love with me? okay, look, i know i pushed you into hiring that creep, but i promise i will do anything i can to fix this."
6549,Gabrielle,"no, thanks. but i do need a, uh, liquid soap dispenser. go."
5275,Gabrielle,"maybe, but i doubt it."
7563,Gabrielle,what is he wearing? he looks like the lost member of wham!
7377,Gabrielle,i'm texting someone.
5004,Gabrielle,"honey, the doctors here are great!"
5471,Gabrielle,what does that mean?
4279,Gabrielle,"it's okay. it was a close call, but i managed to cover. i got you these, so from now on, we can't let carlos see you around the house wearing anything that resembles a gym sock."
8083,Gabrielle,how do you sleep with someone and not remember?
5765,Gabrielle,it was my grandmother's name.
6232,Gabrielle,"do you know how much i was worth?! when we met, i was on the cover of magazines. i had a career and a future, but i gave it all up for you, and what did i get in return?"
5884,Gabrielle,"yeah, well,it gives me volume,so i guess we're both gonna have a problem."
5318,Gabrielle,"look, the guy who broke in stole ice cream. i don't think i'm in any danger. so you can go. i don't need you."
6754,Gabrielle,give me the pictures!
4283,Gabrielle,it did cross our minds.
5720,Gabrielle,so why put me through this?
7071,Gabrielle,probably. why?
7004,Gabrielle,"i'm just not in a rush to unload this house,okay?this was my home.i was very happy here."
5195,Gabrielle,i don't know. tell him you're happily married or gay!
7652,Gabrielle,hmm.
7286,Gabrielle,"yes, i feel awful, but he threatened our lives. it was self-defense."
7968,Gabrielle,"i'm planning on having a massive hangover tomorrow, so keep the girls up late so we can all sleep in."
6098,Gabrielle,"really? wow. well, thank you. okay, you've seen my face. now you can beat it."
8552,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. your daddy's just being silly. can i talk to you for a second, silly daddy?"
6364,Gabrielle,"i think i do. you miss your mommy, and it feels funny seeing your daddy be nice to somebody else. but believe me, i'm not trying to replace your mom."
4262,Gabrielle,i love taking baths. especially with you. it's like taking a vacation from the world.
6359,Gabrielle,this will blow over.
6806,Gabrielle,"i mean, we as in she betrayed me, and you're my best friends, so you're gonna support me because that's what friends do."
4971,Gabrielle,"he, uh-"
5524,Gabrielle,you used to go crazy when men would so much as look at me the wrong way--and that's when i had clothes on.
7949,Gabrielle,"well, she's not gonna leave her party to go buy a doll."
7493,Gabrielle,"ah, nice to meet you. carlos told me how much he enjoyed taking classes with roxy."
4917,Gabrielle,i want to know who to be angry at.
6324,Gabrielle,can't you give me a second chance?
4594,Gabrielle,i promise.
5361,Gabrielle,who is sister mary bernard?
4582,Gabrielle,"and who is going to be changing the diapers when you're pumping iron in a federal prison, huh? i like my lifestyle, and i don't want you to kill it."
7549,Gabrielle,"hey, ellie, you got a sec?"
6264,Gabrielle,"you must be tanya. i'm gabrielle. we're gonna be co-models today. now i don't know if you've ever done one of these big shoots before, but don't be nervous. durkin and i are old friends. he's a sweetheart. now just remember, he's the king, do exactly what he says, and you'll be fine."
7857,Gabrielle,great. so do i have anemia? is that why i've been so tired?
7642,Gabrielle,"no way, bree. i don't want katherine in our games. she bums me out."
4842,Gabrielle,yeah.
8006,Gabrielle,huh. huh.
5433,Gabrielle,"no, it's better because you can do it in the comfort of your own car."
7860,Gabrielle,"oh, gaby, why do i need to wear a condom? there's no way lightning's gonna strike twice."
6499,Gabrielle,shh! here it comes.
4588,Gabrielle,"mmm, it's perfect! oh, mm, crispy and burnt on the outside but nice and steamy on the inside."
5261,Gabrielle,i'm just not gonna eat for two days.
6723,Gabrielle,just trying to get your attention.
4999,Gabrielle,"am i supposed to be impressed? because of your little stunt with my birth control pills, i've lost my freedom for the next eighteen years."
6559,Gabrielle,zach!
7974,Gabrielle,"well, thanks, but the girls already have a school."
5892,Gabrielle,fine.you can use our toilet.
5606,Gabrielle,"carlos,what are you doing?"
6239,Gabrielle,you know what the weird part is?
5245,Gabrielle,"i said i was catholic, not a fanatic. you know, david, you could tell me to stop. just tell me to stop, and i will, or you can have me right now, on my terms."
7364,Gabrielle,no. i'm not thinking about money today. i'm burying my husband.
5298,Gabrielle,"jeez, how are you feeling today?"
4297,Gabrielle,what are you doing here?
7779,Gabrielle,"susan, i saw that! kids, get inside!"
6596,Gabrielle,we had sex last night!
6662,Gabrielle,is that supposed to flatter me?
5048,Gabrielle,"you know, taking away my access to our account, that's just vindictive."
6415,Gabrielle,"well, okay, wait, wait, wait,let me explain."
5365,Gabrielle,"how do you ease into, 'hi, i'm your illegitimate daughter'?"
6407,Gabrielle,anything for a good cause.
5943,Gabrielle,"because carlos doesn't have an adulterous bone in his body.what we just did he could never do.for him, sex isn't just sex. it's a sign of intimacy.it's the way he shows love.you know, instead of talking and listening and spending time with me. what was that for?"
8659,Gabrielle,vera wang! where are you getting all these dresses?
6402,Gabrielle,"oh, don't act innocent. you know you sent me these flowers."
6934,Gabrielle,it is after three o'clock! where the hell is bree with my something new?
4321,Gabrielle,dammit! the virgin gave it up already?
8113,Gabrielle,"juanita, it's time for your bath."
6977,Gabrielle,it means so much to me that we're all here together right now.
7287,Gabrielle,"he took the lord's name in vain. look, we have a good plan. let's just stick to it."
7416,Gabrielle,"oh, edie, it wasn't a competition, but, yeah, i guess i did."
8260,Gabrielle,you're welcome.
6167,Gabrielle,"so did i hurt you, or should i keep trying?"
4425,Gabrielle,come again?
6557,Gabrielle,oh. you know my friend zach?
4843,Gabrielle,"that? uh, oh carlos just got a little rough, made me sign some papers."
5184,Gabrielle,oh my god. you fired him because you're jealous?
7192,Gabrielle,"oh, let it go! john rowland didn't do anything to you that you're not doing to victor."
8562,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so sweet. tell him no way in hell."
6615,Gabrielle,"zach, a real man is honest. all you've ever tried to do is bribe and trick me into falling in love with you. a little advice next time: don't play games. just stand up and be the kind of man a woman would be proud to share her life with."
8236,Gabrielle,so this was his bonus? a salad and a stuffed chicken breast?
5819,Gabrielle,"no, it doesn't have to be, okay?just do the right thing and sign the release form."
7781,Gabrielle,"that's your defense? you were only assaulting her ""a little""?"
5601,Gabrielle,"carlos, she wouldn't have been just a maid.she would have been the best damn maid ever."
8038,Gabrielle,what? what's he saying?
6328,Gabrielle,"come on, you guys. let's go!"
5831,Gabrielle,"no, no, no, ma'am,you don't understand.you don't understand,this is our baby!"
6628,Gabrielle,now you're hitting on me?
8468,Gabrielle,what is?
6516,Gabrielle,"great. in order for this magical night to occur, you're gonna need to help mike delfino."
6960,Gabrielle,is this about running for governor? because i told you how i feel about that.
8383,Gabrielle,"i don't think that'll be a problem. by the way, you're gonna be reporting to this woman lucy. she's a real star, so you're gonna wanna keep an eye on her."
6260,Gabrielle,did i say that? water under the bridge. i thought it was funny.
7783,Gabrielle,i did.
8581,Gabrielle,we're gonna be us again--the old carlos and gaby.
6350,Gabrielle,"oh, honestly? um, i hate it. it's like i've forgotten how to date."
6688,Gabrielle,so what kind of orange is this shirt? like a salmon or a coral?
5230,Gabrielle,you can't just quit in the middle of a hearing.
4631,Gabrielle,what do you mean?
6399,Gabrielle,"uh, there's no signature. sorry. this is kind of awkward."
6880,Gabrielle,"oh, i see you got the invitation!"
7245,Gabrielle,i thought you kept your boat at the yacht club.
5714,Gabrielle,"honey,the one in the center is 3 karats."
5027,Gabrielle,you don't know it's your baby. i don't even know it's your baby. and i don't wanna know 'cause it doesn't matter!
8656,Gabrielle,"oh, that's a pretty dress. oh, my god, it's versace!"
8382,Gabrielle,"yeah, okay. what are they paying?"
4475,Gabrielle,have a seat. you can start by helping us alphabetize the donation cards.
6056,Gabrielle,"don't you love this?oh, god bless tom for taking the kids camping."
7836,Gabrielle,it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
5323,Gabrielle,he thought i was cheating with two gay guys. are you sure you want to go with perceptive?
8389,Gabrielle,that son of a--i'm gonna kill him!
8541,Gabrielle,"juanita, hurry up. the bus will be here any minute."
4609,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, you know me, i'll survive."
6196,Gabrielle,"go, ida!"
5528,Gabrielle,what are you doing?
5616,Gabrielle,"well,the doctor's not 100% positive,but it's very,very iffy."
6665,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
7361,Gabrielle,milton. hi. it's a nice turnout.
7344,Gabrielle,"give me the damn folder, edie!"
4890,Gabrielle,"sh! we'll talk later, you're watching the game."
6210,Gabrielle,"you got a new job? honey, that's wonderful!"
4300,Gabrielle,"hey! i'm not going to stop my life just because she decides to show up. unannounced, i might add."
7604,Gabrielle,"carlos, i was a fashion model in the '90s. i know cocaine."
7737,Gabrielle,right.
5930,Gabrielle,xiao-mei--how did you rip your panties?
6207,Gabrielle,the whole divorce thing. maybe we shouldn't go through with it. it's not like we're gonna find this kind of passion with anyone else.
6095,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, the gloves aren't just off-- they're 70 % off! get your cashmere gloves!"
7088,Gabrielle,"you think victor's my only option? well,igot news for you, carlos. i can have any guy i want, because this--waits for no man."
6481,Gabrielle,"here, let me get it."
5356,Gabrielle,"well, what did they do?"
8433,Gabrielle,"oh, my god."
5802,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
5412,Gabrielle,that's your excuse? we missed side-by-side water massages. i had to book them weeks in advance.
6966,Gabrielle,"well, here's one less thing you have to worry about-- our wedding."
5889,Gabrielle,it's right down the hall.
7730,Gabrielle,"well, it's the caterer! everything is fabulous. but would you be a dear and get me some more wine?"
5648,Gabrielle,"oh,bree, she didn't trash you. honest."
4459,Gabrielle,"oh, i know i shouldn't complain. it's just there's something missing, and i don't know what it is. do you ever feel that way?"
4391,Gabrielle,who the hell's dana?
5303,Gabrielle,we all grieve differently.
6835,Gabrielle,what are you doing? i told you i was leaving. stop writing!
6882,Gabrielle,i am so throwing the bouquet to you!
7246,Gabrielle,where's the crew?
5340,Gabrielle,"okay, should i say something?"
5724,Gabrielle,"look,we spent a lot of money on that.the least you can do is open it so we can bask in your happy expression."
4202,Gabrielle,"well, uh, what time does your mom get back from soccer practice?"
8638,Gabrielle,"well, let her wait. i need something to drink. trying to keep down one of hers world-famous tamales."
7050,Gabrielle,i know. do you believe that pie business? i thought bree's head was gonna explode.
5040,Gabrielle,"what, you want a father's day card?"
6838,Gabrielle,forty dollars? you think i'm gonna pay that?
6340,Gabrielle,i have no idea where you're going with this.
7891,Gabrielle,"well, uh, what's to discuss? for that kind of money, you can lock him in a cage and feed him peanuts."
4347,Gabrielle,i supervise.
6572,Gabrielle,"but can't it wait till after dessert? and by dessert, i mean sex. you are clear on that, right?"
7842,Gabrielle,"hey, beautiful!"
6035,Gabrielle,"give me those! get away, those are mine."
5675,Gabrielle,"well,this is the first time someone told me i couldn't have one."
5781,Gabrielle,"well,she's a baby.you hold her.you bounce her and, i don't know,maybe sing a little something."
6618,Gabrielle,i did not say to humiliate me!
7171,Gabrielle,"sorry about that. a complete shock. i mean, of all people to run into."
5808,Gabrielle,"uh, well, hi, dale.nice to meet you.a lot of people have been looking for you."
4403,Gabrielle,"what? uh, yes, no, um, is that how she heard it?"
4357,Gabrielle,i wasn't aware you two were friends.
4559,Gabrielle,uh! i guess i am.
8200,Gabrielle,"not tough enough? let me tell you something, mr. iraqi army guy."
7060,Gabrielle,you think i don't care?
5331,Gabrielle,and then you'll leave?
5880,Gabrielle,carlos--what's going on?
8630,Gabrielle,isn't it just easier to shut down your hoo-ha until he gives in?
7610,Gabrielle,"hey! you don't even know her. okay, yes, she's made some bad choices, but deep down, she's a good person."
7271,Gabrielle,"well, i thought you were trying to kill me."
7257,Gabrielle,"uh, actually, i'm really cold. maybe we should bail and do this another day. you know, when it's warmer."
7419,Gabrielle,what are you talking about?
8000,Gabrielle,"yes. not all fish is shaped like a stick. now i know you're not used to it, but give it a try. you're gonna love it. mmm. yummy."
6132,Gabrielle,"lynette, you're not serious."
5952,Gabrielle,"to have meaningless sex, carlos. not to sleep with the woman who's carrying our child!"
7453,Gabrielle,this place is huge! would it kill them to have valet parking?
6332,Gabrielle,"yeah, she's a trooper. let's dump her."
5708,Gabrielle,"well,first of all,i'm gonna show her one of our tax returns.once she sees how much money we have,i have a hunch we're gonna look a whole lot whiter."
4419,Gabrielle,call 911.
6970,Gabrielle,you only suggested it. you can't make him go after something he doesn't want.
8148,Gabrielle,he has a name. what's your name?
6534,Gabrielle,"wait, zach. zach, i'm not mad!"
6658,Gabrielle,you will never be my boyfriend.
5144,Gabrielle,"you were about to turn me down, then you reconsidered once you realized i was gonna throw a ton of money at you. which i am."
7394,Gabrielle,so we just wanted you to know that we're here for you.
8183,Gabrielle,"the palm? as in, ""they don't even show the prices on the menu"" the palm? honey, we're still paying off credit card debt."
4867,Gabrielle,"no, 'cos if i leave then i'll be broke, and that would be awful. and if i stay he'll be in control and that's horrifying. and he cut up all my credit cards, which means i'm married to him and unable to shop, which is probably the worst of all possible worlds."
5722,Gabrielle,who's the father?
5899,Gabrielle,"carlos, stop with the dance.it's already in the wallpaper."
7400,Gabrielle,"okay, this may come as a little shock to you--but guess who's getting married again? and i was thinking, maybe you could perform the ceremony. is tuesday good for you?"
7861,Gabrielle,"put the baby down, carlos."
6368,Gabrielle,"you're working so hard, sherri. you must really wanna win this pageant."
7471,Gabrielle,just picking up some vitamins. i'll be quicker if i do it myself.
5978,Gabrielle,"hi, hi, lee wang, right.remember me.xiao mei lives with me.you came over, we had lunch."
8506,Gabrielle,"patty, do you mind if i steal tom for a sec?"
6830,Gabrielle,"vern, focus. it's never bad luck when i look fabulous."
8493,Gabrielle,"gee, this bit just gets funnier and funnier."
6191,Gabrielle,"nah, i already paid a lawyer. i'm taking him down."
5253,Gabrielle,vern.
5297,Gabrielle,"carlos, your hands."
7709,Gabrielle,"carlos, we got invited to michelle downing's party! i'm gonna have to buy something nice to--aah!"
7144,Gabrielle,"you know, for a guy getting rubbed down by a hot nurse, you ask a lot of questions."
5474,Gabrielle,it was a harmless little kiss!why is everybody making a big deal about this?
4714,Gabrielle,what?
7145,Gabrielle,"well, don't just stand there. come in. we have lots of food and fun and surprises."
4203,Gabrielle,"you better hurry, we don't have a lot of time."
6650,Gabrielle,he's married.
6789,Gabrielle,who?
7951,Gabrielle,"you sure are making this hard. i have tried to be nice, but i am running out of polite here, so i'm just gonna say knock it off."
6244,Gabrielle,okay.
6218,Gabrielle,carlos? honey? carlos?
7541,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, ellie. there's been some tension between my husband and me. see, the truth is, we could've had the room rented by now if my husband wasn't so paranoid."
8011,Gabrielle,that only covers 85%. and we are broke.
5248,Gabrielle,i don't think so.
4230,Gabrielle,you free at 4?
6732,Gabrielle,taking my piece.
6744,Gabrielle,"oh, you don't wanna marry her. she's a tramp. hold out for a good girl."
6303,Gabrielle,"now i want you to pretend you're on the runway--flashbulbs are popping, everyone's looking at you, envying you, and they're all thinking the same thing--isabel horowitz is smoking hot! go, isabel! go! you're doing it! isabel, you're doing it! that's it! keep going!"
5518,Gabrielle,why? you either care if men leer at me or not.and you made it clear that you don't.so what's the point?
4298,Gabrielle,does carlos know you are coming?
5257,Gabrielle,good. you know what? it's a little snug.
4504,Gabrielle,helen! do you have a minute?
6054,Gabrielle,see you then.
6166,Gabrielle,"i got a second wind last night, so i went to a bar. that's where i met jason. we spent the whole night how did you put it? pulling the trigger. so did i hurt you, or should i keep trying?"
5089,Gabrielle,"we are both controlled by our husbands, which is idiotic because they're both behind bars. we should have all the power."
7221,Gabrielle,which also means you had it when we got divorced.
7090,Gabrielle,i think i got a chill. now let me see if i can give you one.
6655,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
7293,Gabrielle,"well, he took it pretty hard. oh, you don't think he did anything stupid, do you?"
8418,Gabrielle,i couldn't sleep. i was a little hot. that's better. you look a little warm yourself.
6425,Gabrielle,it's okay. i'm probably not ready to date.
6176,Gabrielle,got it.
5315,Gabrielle,okay?
6502,Gabrielle,"oh, zach. what are you doing here?"
4718,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, no, it's not the money. it's just, uh, carlos and i are trying to prioritize some little things we need to do around the house."
6841,Gabrielle,"oh, this morning, i got in a fight with a parking cop over a ticket, and the guy was a total jerk."
7811,Gabrielle,"carlos, the only time you and i have to ourselves is late at night, but by that time, we're too exhausted. and now that we have celia in afternoon preschool, all we have to do is unload juanita, and then we can get back to doing the nasty."
6108,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, put some pants on!"
5567,Gabrielle,"yes!sister mary manipulated you into threatening me,but you're the idiot that fell for it."
4835,Gabrielle,"lynnette, will you go after her?"
7135,Gabrielle,"this is serious, okay? if victor wakes up with a zoo in his pants, there's gonna be hell to pay."
4238,Gabrielle,"hi, ashley. remember me? we met earlier?"
5997,Gabrielle,and i want my pearl necklace back. don't think i didn't notice that you swiped it.
5270,Gabrielle,"when i decided to marry carlos, i told these girls i would spend the rest of my days being rich and in love and childless, and they laughed at me, and they said i would just end up being another fat hausfrau living a life that i didn't plan. i'm not gonna give them the satisfaction of knowing they were right."
6933,Gabrielle,"i do, too."
5545,Gabrielle,"who cares?father, it's me."
6840,Gabrielle,"well, it is ending a lot better than it started."
5294,Gabrielle,"i just, i have so many errands to run and a million thing to return."
6413,Gabrielle,"really? uh, well,the flowers were so beautiful, i'd like to know who to thank."
8483,Gabrielle,"actually, that's my leg. get your hand off."
8479,Gabrielle,she should be. she's been doing it since she rode shotgun on an actual stagecoach.
4443,Gabrielle,including in the alley? behind the truck stop?
5679,Gabrielle,"$20,000.00"
6761,Gabrielle,"look, i know this is my fault, so if you wanna bite my head off, go ahead."
5863,Gabrielle,"and,uh,give xiao-mei a kick in the pants.i haven't seen her all morning."
8268,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. uh, but i'm not enjoying it as much as i thought i would."
4617,Gabrielle,"obviously, i'm not leaving my husband and marrying john."
6396,Gabrielle,okay.
6146,Gabrielle,not in front of arlos-cay! go upstairs. i'll meet you there.
5705,Gabrielle,"well,that's different."
6038,Gabrielle,what were you thinking setting carlos up with that skank?!
6374,Gabrielle,that's a good point. now i wish i hadn't told amy.
5012,Gabrielle,"all right, there we go. so we're good? see you in court."
6044,Gabrielle,it's time! i can't believe this is happening!
4791,Gabrielle,yeah. of course.
8094,Gabrielle,"i know. just listen to what bradley has to say, and if at the end of the evening you're still not interested, i support you completely. deal?"
7481,Gabrielle,"well, why shouldn't i get something out of this? you know, the blindness didn't just happen to you."
6421,Gabrielle,"no, no, no! wait, wait, wait. i just need a couple more minutes. i need to know the truth."
5575,Gabrielle,hello. what's going on?
7131,Gabrielle,can't you just call me?
5307,Gabrielle,"honey, are you okay?"
7214,Gabrielle,"milton lang doesn't want me to leave victor until after he runs for governor. once the election's over, ka-ching!"
7330,Gabrielle,yeah. this afternoon.
7235,Gabrielle,i don't know. i'm taking it one day at a time. but what i can say about victor is he doesn't lie to me about how much money he's got.
4447,Gabrielle,that's good to hear.
6555,Gabrielle,no. moment's gone. you killed it.
7827,Gabrielle,"what, that sometimes mommy rides daddy like a mechanical bull to get jewelry? she's 5. she's too young to understand either half of that."
4677,Gabrielle,when?
7809,Gabrielle,that little weirdo is the key to you and i having more sex.
6956,Gabrielle,"well, they're not gonna get us again. i made nice with fairview. i'm not about to suck up to the whole damn state."
4371,Gabrielle,it turns out your mother is quite the card shark.
5394,Gabrielle,"sorry. he's such an animal but since we have a couple of minutes, why don't we, uh, chat?"
8510,Gabrielle,"yes, she's like that. she'll give you the bra off her back."
5826,Gabrielle,"no, no,no, no, no, no!"
5627,Gabrielle,"hey--i don't know about you,but i am tired of all the tension around here,so i was thinking we could go shopping,have some fun.then maybe later we can talk about the surrogacy thing,see if we can make it work."
7527,Gabrielle,where do you think i've been? there's no sign of her anywhere.
5154,Gabrielle,no. i like to keep a clear head when i'm telling people off. what makes you think you know anything about me or my husband?
8197,Gabrielle,"oh, you're just afraid i'm gonna look better than you!"
6623,Gabrielle,"it's my fault. i should've known he couldn't handle the whole ""let's be friends"" thing."
5075,Gabrielle,"uh, they're, they're nice."
8503,Gabrielle,"ladies, start your blenders."
6451,Gabrielle,what? no!
4550,Gabrielle,yeah. so what do you got?
4819,Gabrielle,what's that?
6724,Gabrielle,"hey, you hurt me. if i have to strike back hard to protect myself--"
4211,Gabrielle,attagirl. i'm just gonna take these upstairs.
5977,Gabrielle,i did not lose our baby.stop saying that!i know exactly where it is!inside some crazy chinese woman!who also stole half a chicken from my fridge!
7186,Gabrielle,and i will see you later.
7119,Gabrielle,"night, carlos."
6948,Gabrielle,what? and just go to the reception? you can't do that.
5537,Gabrielle,okay.
5080,Gabrielle,"honey, he's in jail. how far is he gonna go? maybe it's time you stood up for yourself. tell him you don't need the surgery."
6597,Gabrielle,"i mean, i think we did. that's what he told me."
7159,Gabrielle,"hours? are you serious? oh, my god."
7313,Gabrielle,"well, why wouldn't i? just let me grab my purse."
7829,Gabrielle,"hi, bethany. i'm here to pick up juanita. is she around?"
6357,Gabrielle,orson was slipping it to the dead chick?
8367,Gabrielle,"yeah, no problem. two eggs coming right up. wait. i made omelets this morning, so i'm all out."
7267,Gabrielle,ice pick? what are you doing?
7063,Gabrielle,"but on the plus side, i made a pretty good career out of knowing how to smile when i didn't really feel like it. but i can't pretend with you. not when i'm scared i'm gonna lose you."
7189,Gabrielle,"yes, i had an affair. old news. move on. where's that room service?"
4713,Gabrielle,i can't hear you!
5210,Gabrielle,"yes, you did, and i considered it for about a second."
7958,Gabrielle,"honey, i'm home. you wouldn't believe the traffic--"
8575,Gabrielle,thank you.
7967,Gabrielle,"okay, girls, mommy's leaving. i love you!"
7565,Gabrielle,"oh, crap! abort! abort!"
4937,Gabrielle,"reaching out from the grave to screw with me. god, she's good."
6844,Gabrielle,you ready to be the mayor's wife?
5435,Gabrielle,"honey, he's going to a remote village in africa. does it really matter that he's allergic to eggs?"
5259,Gabrielle,because you just called me fat!
5804,Gabrielle,"look, i think we all know that karl is a dog.mm.i mean, but let's face it--if these tramps weren't laying out the buffet,he wouldn't be chowing down."
4392,Gabrielle,so who the hell is that?
4399,Gabrielle,"oh, danielle, remember when you said you wanted to be a model?"
7386,Gabrielle,"oh, i bet that was hard. so where'd you put 'em?"
7417,Gabrielle,hero? why am i a hero?
5730,Gabrielle,"are we talking about the same idiot?i think for $8,000,he'd throw in a kidney."
7681,Gabrielle,"look, my daughter was invited to a princess party, so i can't let her be the only girl there without a princess dress."
5634,Gabrielle,"the only reason she offered up her dusty womb is because she's screwed.her latest sugar daddy gave her the boot,so mom needs a place to stay and money.so trust me,if she carried our child,we'd be footing the bill for years."
6828,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, carlos."
7422,Gabrielle,"okay, i'm calling dr. dunlap."
6157,Gabrielle,always happy to help a brother out. hold on.
5709,Gabrielle,"well,thank you,sweetie.i clean up well for a wetback,don't i?"
7666,Gabrielle,what?!
5141,Gabrielle,"yeah, but when we would finish arguing, we had this great sex! now all we do is fight and there's no payoff and it sucks! you and i need to get laid!"
6087,Gabrielle,"sure, and i was married when we got together."
6016,Gabrielle,yeah.
6279,Gabrielle,i don't believe that.
6262,Gabrielle,"well, i just wanna work."
5443,Gabrielle,"no, no, not at all.as a matter of fact,all of my secret crushes were on the band geeks."
6089,Gabrielle,"yeah, that can happen."
8404,Gabrielle,"carlos, do you realize since bradley died and you took over, we haven't had sex once? i miss you. i wanna spend time with you. now move the creamed corn and do me!"
7464,Gabrielle,hang it up!
5970,Gabrielle,oh my gosh!
4359,Gabrielle,"doesn't it make you nervous, a boy alone upstairs with danielle?"
4925,Gabrielle,yeah.
8359,Gabrielle,now i know why you wanted to hire her. she's a force of nature.
6876,Gabrielle,really? same day?
8332,Gabrielle,"that was my guess, too."
4563,Gabrielle,bye.
5161,Gabrielle,like you said. i want what i want when i want it.
4592,Gabrielle,"don't talk like that. everything is going to be fine. we're going to sort this mess out, and you're gonna be on top again."
6307,Gabrielle,"well,let me check my book.i might have to move some stuff around,but i think i can swing it."
5199,Gabrielle,really. what are you gonna say?
6701,Gabrielle,"i've known you for two weeks,and this is the first glimpse of a guy could actually like."
7501,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa! no more doggy treats. she's had enough."
5710,Gabrielle,please. do i look middle class to you?
8156,Gabrielle,"get out of bed in the morning. i've only lived here a month, and i want to put a gun to my head. you know what i mean?"
8081,Gabrielle,"carlos, i've spent the last five years working with the blind. trust me, it's not that fulfilling."
8641,Gabrielle,"we love you, aunt connie! yeah."
8023,Gabrielle,"about two seconds ago. up until then, it was pretty touch-and-go."
4133,Gabrielle,why don't i just pin the receipt to my chest?
4934,Gabrielle,"oh, please!"
5067,Gabrielle,excuse me. i'm looking for rita rivara.
5974,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry, i'm just going to replay the look i had when i found out you hadn't banged him yet."
4750,Gabrielle,and that's - good?
7255,Gabrielle,"oh, i-i was just talking to-- bree."
4743,Gabrielle,"why? because it happened to you? bree, this is how i see it -- good friends support each other after they've been humiliated. great friends pretend nothing happened in the first place."
7600,Gabrielle,ellie? brunch is almost ready! this is gonna be so hard.
5752,Gabrielle,"wait,what is she saying?"
7553,Gabrielle,"earlier tonight, i saw a guy coming out of ellie's room, so i assumed it was her boyfriend, but just now i caught her in there with another guy."
5988,Gabrielle,thank you.
8282,Gabrielle,"well, bradley, we all want things. for instance, i would like carlos to have a week off next month."
5284,Gabrielle,i doubt that.
6578,Gabrielle,what?
8053,Gabrielle,get your boss.
6441,Gabrielle,"honestly, did you think i was gonna sleep with you?"
8502,Gabrielle,"mm. all right, so they have six, and we have six. we're gonna need a tiebreaker. hey, uh, are men allowed to join the group?"
7986,Gabrielle,"hi, sweetie. how's our patient?"
7442,Gabrielle,there you go. all gone.
6014,Gabrielle,"hey, look at you."
8178,Gabrielle,eli would've liked it.
4832,Gabrielle,"so sophie, susan said you're going to the spa tomorrow. is that an all day thing?"
4815,Gabrielle,exactly and then you would have blown all the money on the lawyers.
4477,Gabrielle,is that because of me?
5228,Gabrielle,"sure. now, open up."
4500,Gabrielle,i can't do that!
7169,Gabrielle,"uh, no. he's away at a conference, so i decided to treat myself to a spa weekend."
6608,Gabrielle,"thank you! okay, look, there he goes. go! go get all cholo on his ass."
5733,Gabrielle,"okay,we're done."
6117,Gabrielle,"all right, but we're going through a very messy divorce, and he moved back in on me. and everyone knows the wife keeps the house, and the husband gets the crappy apartment. it's the american way."
7954,Gabrielle,"yeah, too generous. it's like you're trying to buy us or something. well, we're not for sale, so just back off!"
5087,Gabrielle,"well, i do think it's silly to give someone seven thousand dollars if they don't want it."
5423,Gabrielle,"i bet she did. how much cash are you short, father?"
5458,Gabrielle,"oh,oh!it looks like you could use a hand."
8538,Gabrielle,"oh, i hate splitting the pot."
7039,Gabrielle,"uh, you, uh, have a birthday coming up, and, uh, i don't know what to get ya."
7297,Gabrielle,great.
4704,Gabrielle,"then what? huh? finish the sentence, carlos. we've tons of legal bills, you've lost all your clients and even with our savings, we're screwed."
4523,Gabrielle,"yao lin, don't be stupid. people don't become poor overnight."
4772,Gabrielle,thank you so much. that's all i needed to hear.
6435,Gabrielle,"susan, please. we look stupid enough for suspecting him. just let it go."
6894,Gabrielle,"yeah, on and off. mostly off. what if you tie the knot in a month and realize that you miss ian and mike misses the coma?"
5108,Gabrielle,"no, it's our anniversary. we're just reliving the good times."
8545,Gabrielle,"yes, i do. do you have any idea how humiliating it was for me to get that call today? now every parent in town is gonna think that i let my 6-year-old wear makeup to school! and i want my makeup back. is it in here? why do you have this? juanita."
7854,Gabrielle,"what are you gonna do, take up piano and get a contract with motown?"
6318,Gabrielle,really?
5343,Gabrielle,and i would've been a terrible mother.
6908,Gabrielle,"yeah, and then you wouldn't be mad at me for the date, and i wouldn't feel guilty. and we could be brides--"
5098,Gabrielle,how could you forget our anniversary? you sit in a cell all day long staring at a calendar.
4493,Gabrielle,"okay, you're up first, followed by lynette, uh, and then edie--edie. where's edie britt?"
6914,Gabrielle,practically in tears over this whole wedding date thing.
8553,Gabrielle,are you a lunatic? i am not walking into a ballroom full of people without my face on.
8690,Gabrielle,"well, now, this i can work with."
5348,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's him."
5397,Gabrielle,huh?
4650,Gabrielle,"oh no, no, no, wait, wait."
8326,Gabrielle,"you know, jody, i really don't think this is the time or place to discuss gory details."
4667,Gabrielle,you want to mow my lawn for free?
4526,Gabrielle,you call this a paint job?! i don't want to see it again until it's perfect!
6273,Gabrielle,fine. i just need a moment to get into character.
4439,Gabrielle,we weren't driving the car. we didn't chase juanita into the street!
5102,Gabrielle,"i feel tons of guilt, so back off."
6190,Gabrielle,"anyway, what if i never find that passion with anybody else?"
6106,Gabrielle,"uh, would you excuse me?"
5071,Gabrielle,"oh, don't even think about it."
6642,Gabrielle,there is no relationship. this is our last date.
6206,Gabrielle,"carlos, do you think we're making a mistake?"
4730,Gabrielle,"yes. if you hadn't gotten yourself indicted, we would have pipes right now."
5909,Gabrielle,"you pay six bucks an hour. it's all about the perks, honey."
8428,Gabrielle,"hey, lynette! great office. i see you're busy. don't let me disturb you. i just wanted to drop off the girls so i could talk to carlos for a sec. all right, girls, have fun with aunt lynette."
6521,Gabrielle,one million dollars.
8014,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, let's keep our fingers crossed. ow!"
4404,Gabrielle,i just wanted to help out.
7508,Gabrielle,put flags on pencils and sell them at the airport. what do i care? just get out of my kitchen--whoa. what is this about?
6946,Gabrielle,"look, everyone knows you're living with edie. if she shows up alone, people will think i asked her not to bring you, like it bugs me that you guys are together."
4901,Gabrielle,eight months. six with good behaviour.
4760,Gabrielle,"no, honey, these funeral homes make a fortune trying to convince people to overspend."
7372,Gabrielle,yeah--
6746,Gabrielle,"well, if you can choke down that lousy waffle i made you, that'd be a start."
7102,Gabrielle,"tom, watch it!"
8420,Gabrielle,"i'm releasing the horny teen inside of you. now come on. two boobs, no waiting."
6641,Gabrielle,"uh,for the same reason you forgot to sign the check.you've been working me since the second we met,and i've been on to you every step of the way.what?what's so funny?i just called you a manipulative jerk."
4434,Gabrielle,"well, we're not negotiating my uterus."
5790,Gabrielle,motherhood is such a blessing.i hope you get to experience it one day.
5546,Gabrielle,"yeah.look,i need you to do something for me.i need you to get rid of sister mary bernard."
7254,Gabrielle,"oh, crap."
7326,Gabrielle,"uh, you want the fondue set back? fine. but don't act like it cost a bundle, 'cause it clearly didn't."
6700,Gabrielle,"look who's back, mr. cocky."
8442,Gabrielle,do you wanna tell what it is.
6023,Gabrielle,"no, i'll drive."
8402,Gabrielle,"yeah, we did, years ago. don't you remember?"
7616,Gabrielle,"i know, it's crazy. you wouldn't believe the passion. i mean, i was powerless to resist."
7906,Gabrielle,"i am gabrielle solis. perhaps you know my husband? he ""rubs"" your boss. where are they?"
6342,Gabrielle,"of course not, bill. can i call you bill? it's just we feel that amy would benefit from some private coaching. maybe i could come to your house? say, friday, five o'clock?"
5653,Gabrielle,really?
5407,Gabrielle,"oh, i hope that little creep suffered."
5150,Gabrielle,"but, i-"
7429,Gabrielle,"can't. my legs are in the air. just follow the sound of my voice. there you go. i'm over here, sweetie."
6284,Gabrielle,"well, i hope it's more fabulous than this dress. i look like something ike turner would hit."
8373,Gabrielle,"juanita, you play with it every time we go by mrs. mccluskey's. now either tell me the truth, or i'm gonna cancel your birthday party."
4580,Gabrielle,"no, you promised, no babies!"
7840,Gabrielle,so--next playdate's monday at 1:00?
6542,Gabrielle,sure. why not?
5211,Gabrielle,"david, i know you're the lawyer and all, but trust me, it's never a smart strategy to cover this up."
4780,Gabrielle,"oh, that's it. i cannot be a part of this! i can't do it!"
4213,Gabrielle,"oh, john gave it to me."
4862,Gabrielle,"no, i'm talking about my life."
4574,Gabrielle,"carlos, this is not like new york where i made thousands of dollars a day modeling haute couture. i'm doing boat shows. i spend eight hours a day doing this!"
7258,Gabrielle,"oh, okay, well, just in case, we should run back to shore so i can grab a jacket."
5568,Gabrielle,"you made me a promise, carlos,a long time ago--till death do us part.and one day you just come home and start throwing words around like annulment.how do you think that makes me feel?"
8001,Gabrielle,see? delicious!
6683,Gabrielle,"okay, you're mad, so i'm just gonna blow right by that slut crack."
6438,Gabrielle,there's no signature.
8486,Gabrielle,and then we dump her?
4682,Gabrielle,"no, that means i'm all alone. you're leaving."
6107,Gabrielle,what are you doing? i told you i was having friends over!
8202,Gabrielle,"hey, i know some of those women in your exercise class. the most exercise they ever get is cutting a piece of cake."
5980,Gabrielle,i may have mentioned deportation but i didn't think she'd take it personally.
7204,Gabrielle,milton-- you scared me. i thought you were in washington with victor.
7868,Gabrielle,"my period's late, and that never happens to me. i'm like a swiss clock."
6355,Gabrielle,you got it.
6910,Gabrielle,morning.
4456,Gabrielle,hmmm? what is?
7179,Gabrielle,what about your wife?
5860,Gabrielle,"well,what kind of husband do you want?do you want a rich husband?well,then,rich men don't marry virgins for the same reasons they don't hire chauffeurs who can't drive--they value experience."
6635,Gabrielle,"yeah. check, please."
4138,Gabrielle,hmm.
8092,Gabrielle,"hi, honey. you remember bradley and his wife maria. they dropped by for dinner."
4222,Gabrielle,"gorgeous, thankful we have 49 cards to play with."
5418,Gabrielle,"carlos, where are you going? carlos!"
7118,Gabrielle,see you thursday.
5371,Gabrielle,i saw your nun!
4748,Gabrielle,we're gonna pay you back every cent. i promise.
4955,Gabrielle,because i was going to get in.
6416,Gabrielle,"you're right,and i am so sorry for taking up so much of your time."
6243,Gabrielle,"and for what it's worth, i don't like what it's turned you into either."
8355,Gabrielle,i don't care! why couldn't you have told me this before she's about to appear on my doorstep?
5636,Gabrielle,it wouldn't have done any good.
5760,Gabrielle,here.we're good to go.give me the baby.
8634,Gabrielle,"no, it's not just you."
5058,Gabrielle,really? how?
4959,Gabrielle,i'm turning on some music.
7979,Gabrielle,and that is your right as a crazy old rich lady.
8557,Gabrielle,hi. nice to meet you. you're probably wondering why i look like this.
4628,Gabrielle,"i'm running out of money.in a couple of weeks, i will be screwed."
6429,Gabrielle,"carlos, just tell me. i won't be mad.i promise."
8363,Gabrielle,so don't get me wrong--she's attractive. it's just-- she's not really your type. your type is skinny model.
4385,Gabrielle,oh.
5894,Gabrielle,"yeah, in a twin?good luck.god, i want my bed back."
8592,Gabrielle,that vase is not stupid.
4250,Gabrielle,"yes, i, i went jogging today, and i think i just pushed myself too hard."
7476,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry. i told you, i had errands to run first."
8616,Gabrielle,good to know. because gambling is bad enough without being high.
4777,Gabrielle,what's going on? why are we slowing down?
7253,Gabrielle,"well, if he's so mad at me, why would he take me on a boat trip?"
6671,Gabrielle,"okay, ""a,"" i'm not your girlfriend, and ""b,"" she's not gonna find out unless you tell her. come on! a dress this gorgeous is meant to be seen. every day it hangs in the closet, an angel loses its wings."
4552,Gabrielle,"a warrior princess? mr. gibbs. i am a professional model. look at this bone structure. this face is a cash cow, and if you don't have the vision to take advantage of that, then maybe i'm at the wrong agency."
5250,Gabrielle,but zach was starting to obsess with julie again.
7725,Gabrielle,"oh, it's just the caterers putting glasses and silverware on the tables. they make some racket, huh? but the decorations are stunning. especially that waterfall effect."
7061,Gabrielle,"did i ever tell you about my father? he had cancer, too. started in the liver, went into his bones, and ten months later, he was dead."
6384,Gabrielle,"yes, keep it coming."
8055,Gabrielle,fell off a table. don't want to talk about it.
6540,Gabrielle,that's not true.you'd have me.as a friend.a friend friend.not a girlfriend. really cannot overstress that.
4338,Gabrielle,"juanita,i had no idea."
6321,Gabrielle,"okay,look, we have to do damage control. i get it. next session, i'll apologize to all the moms."
6187,Gabrielle,what do you think their secret is?
4649,Gabrielle,i just met the woman today.
7825,Gabrielle,"yeah, carlos, stop that. okay, go to your room, and i'm gonna bring you something for your tummy. i think she bought it."
5069,Gabrielle,"i'm, uh, i'm gabrielle solis. our, our husbands are roommates at the prison."
8681,Gabrielle,welcome home.
7226,Gabrielle,"oh, so you want me to sleep with you and take your money. gee, if that were a job, what would they call it?"
8507,Gabrielle,"first of all, you're a real prince for coming today. thanks to you, our coup is complete."
8662,Gabrielle,"and so-- they give you designer clothes, and you give them--"
4701,Gabrielle,did you feel anything?
6084,Gabrielle,"me, too.do you wanna sit down? you know, you're pretty hard to stay mad at."
4267,Gabrielle,try to hurry. i have stuff to do.
8529,Gabrielle,"if you have a shower at the office, how can you come home smelling so bad?"
6476,Gabrielle,"zach young! oh, my god! it's been ages. wow. look at you! so handsome in a suit."
4681,Gabrielle,i don't know. he's not here. he had a meeting with his lawyer.
5290,Gabrielle,"i'm fine. thank you for the messages. i'm, i'm sorry i haven't had time to return calls."
4771,Gabrielle,"uh huh. was anyone with her? an orderly, candy striper, anyone?"
5256,Gabrielle,because some of my model friends are coming down from new york on friday so i have to look better than ever. i can't have them thinking i moved to the suburbs and i shop at strip malls.
6249,Gabrielle,i should know. i was on the cover.
7485,Gabrielle,you're welcome.
5461,Gabrielle,"uh, i think she got sick."
7307,Gabrielle,"detectives! any, uh, news on my husband?"
8688,Gabrielle,son of a bitch!!!
8445,Gabrielle,is this too red? i think i need something pinky
6792,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah. why else would she have hid the body?"
7014,Gabrielle,you were not.
4448,Gabrielle,"no, me? no, no. confession is not really my thing."
7525,Gabrielle,"well, you know how you like it when i read you the box scores? when i went out to get the paper - only thinking of making you happy-"
7573,Gabrielle,"okay, ellie, wait. you don't have to go."
4272,Gabrielle,"for god's sake, carlos, it's yeolin's."
8049,Gabrielle,"yeah, and i know that now, but--juanita, dance for your dad."
5269,Gabrielle,trust me. they're merciless.
4514,Gabrielle,carlos! carlos! i am so sorry! i am so sorry!
5030,Gabrielle,"honey, we are so sorry."
5505,Gabrielle,"oh,carlos,i love you so much."
4912,Gabrielle,thank you.
8196,Gabrielle,why not?
8665,Gabrielle,ha. funny.
5232,Gabrielle,what?
5982,Gabrielle,"oh, don't give me that we are the world' crap!that woman's uterus is harboring a stolen baby!so if you know where she is you'd better start taking, or else i'm going to get the health department down her and get a closer look at what you're serving as moo sho pork!"
8246,Gabrielle,"oh, brad. come on. saving a marriage? you can't put a price on that--at least not a small one."
6141,Gabrielle,"thank you. carlos. carlos, this is my new friend phil lopez."
4745,Gabrielle,"bree, hi."
5956,Gabrielle,"you're not going anywhere, not as long as you have my baby in your belly."
5775,Gabrielle,what about my sleep?
4870,Gabrielle,with your student credit card?
5186,Gabrielle,"one more word out of you, lisa, and i will back hand you myself."
5719,Gabrielle,"you never gave a crap that we were mexican,did you?"
7596,Gabrielle,and edie threatened to use that to--
4346,Gabrielle,it's a big house. i need help.
5657,Gabrielle,so?
8554,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, once you see this skin without foundation, you may want to rethink that."
4430,Gabrielle,"oh, that's very sweet, danielle, thank you."
7817,Gabrielle,"sex as a blind man. i mean, you used to be so visual. is it still as good?"
8348,Gabrielle,i guess.
8314,Gabrielle,"well, i'm tired of the deal, and what you're doing to maria is despicable."
6609,Gabrielle,hey. so how'd it go?
5044,Gabrielle,me too. look on the bright side. at least we're still rich.
6603,Gabrielle,would you excuse me a second?
7516,Gabrielle,roxy--look what i've got. come on. come on.
7193,Gabrielle,"is it, mr. man in the closet? yeah, you heard me. who's john rowland now?"
6287,Gabrielle,"vern, i worked the catwalks in milan and paris. i'm not gonna give makeup tips to little miss training bra."
8203,Gabrielle,excuse me?
8157,Gabrielle,"there are no good nightclubs, no theater. what do you do for a good time?"
8531,Gabrielle,"oh, phyllis got tanked on cosmos and threw up on edna--so now we're back to planting crap. look, i'm really sorry for sticking my nose into that whole patty rizzo thing."
6998,Gabrielle,in a few weeks? what?no! it has to be tonight!victor's in the bedroom right now waiting to consummate.
7133,Gabrielle,you are still sleeping with edie?
7113,Gabrielle,"look, it was a long time ago, and--and it didn't mean anything."
8071,Gabrielle,why? you need someone?
7633,Gabrielle,"thank you. now please, i just lost a friend. stop being so insensitive."
7971,Gabrielle,"well, here's the thing. i'm supposed to go with my girlfriends."
5375,Gabrielle,you said she touched your soul so i just want to make sure her hands are clean.
8124,Gabrielle,but---
6031,Gabrielle,carlos! no!
8595,Gabrielle,"well, i want juanita to work with the poor. i want to teach her to be grateful for how good she has it."
8304,Gabrielle,"focus, shayla! we are talking about how i'm ruining innocent people's lives."
5504,Gabrielle,"remember scott,the photographer i was dating when we met?the one i dumped for you,who never really got over it and who i always said was gonna get back at me?"
8328,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, i have a feeling most of these vultures didn't come to pay their respects to brad. they're just here to pump us for dirt about his murder."
4599,Gabrielle,hi! so nice to meet you.
6276,Gabrielle,"marcella, look, i don't know what they told you, but all i'm asking for is a simple costume change."
8264,Gabrielle,"oh, really? what is it?"
5932,Gabrielle,"um, and, doctor, uh, while you're down there, could you check if she's still a virgin?"
8364,Gabrielle,except maybe at an airport.
6595,Gabrielle,"uh, oh, yeah. um--he just came by to, uh--drop off a birthday card. really cute little cat with balloons. all right, bye."
5838,Gabrielle,"i don't think i could go through that pain again.i did freeze some of my eggs,so we might do the surrogacy thing,but i don't know."
6644,Gabrielle,"i have noticed, and i'm throwing you back."
7087,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. i am done with your explanations, and i am done with just give me two more weeks, baby. whatever games you're playing, i'm sick of it. we're through."
4572,Gabrielle,"but, how are you gonna work?"
4593,Gabrielle,"okay, carlos -"
5607,Gabrielle,"oh.hi,mom."
6126,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing? carlos! what are you doing?! carlos! you can't leave me out here in the middle of nowhere! ah! carlos!"
6201,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, this old thing? you've seen it all before. i'm just gonna wear the little blue number. will you hand me those stockings? oh, i've got a raggedy nail. you're gonna have to help me put those on."
7450,Gabrielle,it'll start with hair pull and end with detectives taking our statements. remember the pie thing?
6870,Gabrielle,you did?
8284,Gabrielle,nope. he is not to be believed.
4676,Gabrielle,"no, it's not. we are seriously screwed, and i am freaking out that you're not freaking out."
8047,Gabrielle,"oh, it's silly. i sold that baseball of yours. but you're right. you can see, and that's all that matters."
6467,Gabrielle,and you were valedictorian. what were you up to that your mother didn't know about?
8385,Gabrielle,"oh, well, you know me."
4707,Gabrielle,exactly.
7591,Gabrielle,"all right, look, i know we have to do something, but this woman's our friend."
4130,Gabrielle,the police.they called me.
4607,Gabrielle,"hi, um, i don't know if i have the right address. does john rowland live here?"
6589,Gabrielle,"okay,listen to me very carefully,and this is no time to be vague.what exactly was i amazing at?"
5649,Gabrielle,"no,i'm good."
7261,Gabrielle,"well, it'd be easier to talk if we were back on shore. what are you doing?"
8450,Gabrielle,how about bree?
4792,Gabrielle,i promise.
7369,Gabrielle,hey. how you feeling?
7953,Gabrielle,in three days. that's the creepy part.
5611,Gabrielle,"yeah,we're just sick about it."
4426,Gabrielle,i think i'll pass.
6798,Gabrielle,since you started doing things to piss people off.
4623,Gabrielle,"love is not enough. where would we live, here with your roommates? the only decoration in the bathroom is a bong!"
4341,Gabrielle,carlos said that his father left for a waitress in el passo.
8521,Gabrielle,"and by ""do something,"" he means having me slave over a rack of lamb all day."
6135,Gabrielle,he despised you for saying no?
4564,Gabrielle,mr. hartley. it's gabrielle solis. i need you to start working on releasing carlos on bail. mm hmm. i just remembered where i put his passport.
8597,Gabrielle,"wow, it's been years! the last time i saw you was at that charity fashion show. wasn't that fun?"
8523,Gabrielle,"although i keep telling tom how dangerous gardens can be. everywhere you step, there are shovels and rakes and hoes."
6849,Gabrielle,just stand back and enjoy the carnage.
4336,Gabrielle,"mama solis, carlos is going to be late home for dinner. it's just the two of us.what would you like to eat?"
7870,Gabrielle,because he and lee are here. bob's an attorney. i'm gonna get him to sue the quack who obviously botched your vasectomy.
7057,Gabrielle,it's good. are you cold? they keep it cold in here.
7333,Gabrielle,"um, go. you guys go."
4212,Gabrielle,okay.
4759,Gabrielle,don't you think that's a little over the top?
8144,Gabrielle,"you never buy me a present unless i'm mad or about to be mad. and i don't think i am, so why am i about to be?"
6731,Gabrielle,"no, wait! this is the first time i've had you to myself all night."
5508,Gabrielle,"i know,i was freakishly flexible back then.i'm sorry!look,what are we gonna do about this?"
6489,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetie. i really wish you would."
8651,Gabrielle,"oh, i doubt it. you haven't seen her since she was 6."
8276,Gabrielle,"well, what are friends for?"
5681,Gabrielle,"right, uh, lots of love.honey, can i talk to you for a second?"
6006,Gabrielle,and what?
6619,Gabrielle,"i want you to leave me alone! this friends thing isn't gonna work 'cause you're always gonna want more, and i'm never gonna love you-- ever."
5658,Gabrielle,"yeah,but it's st. barts,and your hands are covering my naughty parts."
6153,Gabrielle,"no, no, i'm not talking to you. back off!"
8509,Gabrielle,"yeah, about that--i gotta warn you. patty's kinda got a thing for married men."
6598,Gabrielle,"no, i don't remember anything! i just woke up, and he was in bed next to me."
7158,Gabrielle,"i'm leaving in five minutes. uh, brett, could you come here a second? how long has that van been parked over there?"
4666,Gabrielle,what kind of favor?
7658,Gabrielle,"oh. right. the bear. well-- i looked all over and just couldn't find it. i guess the cops took it. i'm really sorry, ellie. i know it was a gift from your dad. it just breaks my heart."
4232,Gabrielle,if you would. please.
8455,Gabrielle,wow! you were right about this place.
6862,Gabrielle,he was mean. he deserved it.
6480,Gabrielle,you got a little chocolate on your shirt.
5445,Gabrielle,poor baby.i would've kissed you.
7181,Gabrielle,"i-i wasn't ""trapped."""
7792,Gabrielle,"i used to be. look at my life, susan. i--i've been beaten down."
6226,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, give it to me! carlos! yes! yes! carlos--"
5427,Gabrielle,what?
8036,Gabrielle,per nulla? what does that mean?
5577,Gabrielle,"really? baby, can i talk to you for a second?"
5736,Gabrielle,you think this is funny?
7213,Gabrielle,"oh, uh, yeah, about that--what if we make it 13? okay, no, just go with me on this. what i'm about to propose will give us total financial freedom and-- help a conniving billionaire's dream come true."
4575,Gabrielle,"hello. hi, bree. what?"
6301,Gabrielle,but where's your confidence? where's your pride?
7766,Gabrielle,"your car! i took it to a mechanic, who told me the radiator's shot."
6740,Gabrielle,i made you waffles! eat 'em while they're hot. what?
4248,Gabrielle,oh honey. these heels don't have another block in them.
8262,Gabrielle,"it's like you saidtheir marriage is none of our business. he's the one who's cheating. if we say anything, it'll just make things worse. we're the good guys here, carlos."
5438,Gabrielle,"baby, that's the fever talking. the doctor said you're having an allergic reaction, but you're gonna be fine, okay?"
7845,Gabrielle,"get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch!"
7595,Gabrielle,"okay, look, i'm all for doing my civic duty, but this woman-- she's-- sort of a-- friend. and now you're asking us to trick her? i'm not sure we're comfortable with this."
8242,Gabrielle,really?
5757,Gabrielle,read the instructions!
6486,Gabrielle,wait a minute. who says i need someone to take care of me?
8056,Gabrielle,it's beautiful. where'd it come from?
4191,Gabrielle,"i'm not in the mood. but, we could stay up and talk."
4981,Gabrielle,maybe this is a mistake. if there's one thing i've learned men can't be trusted.
6372,Gabrielle,"well, i thought you two were practically sisters."
8008,Gabrielle,"friday?! but you said it would be at least a month. i mean, that's so soon."
10356,Lynette,"oh,that's ridiculous."
11405,Lynette,not afraid to shamelessly ass kiss. you are doing very well.
10625,Lynette,we can't afford this.we have four kids.tom just lost his job.that'd bankrupt us.
8876,Lynette,"the boys are fascinating. they even have their own twin secret language, don't they,tom?"
12780,Lynette,"porter wasn't there, and she won't tell me where he is."
10229,Lynette,"uh-huh, and when were you there?because you forgot to list your dates of employment for that one."
13265,Lynette,come on. i know you know. it's cancer again. am i right?
12641,Lynette,"no, i have to talk to someone else first. remember when you left that soda can on the coffee table, and it left a ring, and i yelled at you i take it all back."
10763,Lynette,"all right, all right, all right, all right. i'm pulling over! jeez! what the hell are you doing?!"
11172,Lynette,shouldn't you be working?
12392,Lynette,"okay, you're not gonna believe this, but--she's back."
12456,Lynette,calm down. i'm gonna break it off in an e-mail.
11990,Lynette,"hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
10650,Lynette,nora.
8831,Lynette,"well, obviously they will be punished for this. severely."
12607,Lynette,yeah. what's wrong with you? you've been antsy all night.
10071,Lynette,"no, i am on mindy's side. she is the one caught in the middle, and i'm not letting you two have her until you calm down."
11789,Lynette,"gaby, where have you been? you went to the bathroom, like, half an hour ago."
10866,Lynette,"of course you did, 'cause you're a smart guy, which is also why you are gonna jump on the idea i have to make the whole thing work."
11836,Lynette,"could you check on 'em for me, please?"
12917,Lynette,yeah?
9437,Lynette,"lily, we're coming back."
9777,Lynette,right back.
11080,Lynette,"okay, okay, we've all made some excellent points and blown off a little steam. whoo! let's play some cards."
10976,Lynette,"fantastic! lead the way, i'm coming in."
10955,Lynette,"oh, forget it! forget it! we'll work that out later."
10601,Lynette,not ready for that yet.
11239,Lynette,"no, they're probably from zach young."
12540,Lynette,hey.
9455,Lynette,"thank you, thank you. alright in you go."
10155,Lynette,it is not the ebola virus.it's chicken pox.you are being a baby.
12724,Lynette,"hey, preston."
12409,Lynette,but i told them they couldn't go.
13041,Lynette,i thought it would be a nice addition to your collection.
12927,Lynette,"all right, that's enough! let go of him! let go of him! let go of him!"
10754,Lynette,"yeah, i do mind. i mind deeply."
10845,Lynette,"thanks. no, seriously, though."
8756,Lynette,"here's, uh, here's what i pulled for edie. i should warn you, most of the clothes in there aren't that stylish."
11016,Lynette,he really did. that's why you don't have to worry. that's protector man's job. your job is to run and play and have fun. okay?
10603,Lynette,i had already let you go.
9212,Lynette,thank you.
9526,Lynette,"i almost forgot, your file. here."
11656,Lynette,hmm?
9482,Lynette,then why don't you think about moving somewhere less expensive? like a nursing home?
10527,Lynette,"oh,it'll never happen.he knows this place will go down like a house of cards without me."
13002,Lynette,"mr. vivinetto, i'm not obligated to answer. it's the law."
11909,Lynette,"no! this is about personal freedom--specifically, my personal freedom to take down that jackbooted hausfrau."
13197,Lynette,"tom, men don't need plastic surgery. they look better as they age."
9758,Lynette,"yeah, and the best part of it is i got you a really cool backpack."
9790,Lynette,dad's gonna take you.
10962,Lynette,"well, maybe you deserved to be cheated on!i'm.. i'm-- i'm sorry.i shouldn't have said that."
9751,Lynette,the sandwiches from yesterday?
11731,Lynette,"hey,i'm coming!hey,don't just lie there like a lump!come on! help me look!"
11497,Lynette,okay.
8795,Lynette,so did mike say anything?
10756,Lynette,"no, my favorite game is counting all the things i'm dying to say to you but i don't. like--pipe down, you annoying nut job.' i'd never say that."
12973,Lynette,i-- ugh!
12857,Lynette,"it wouldn't be a loan or a gift. it would be--an investment that would buy you, say--15% of scavo's."
12713,Lynette,hey. whose lawyer are you anyway?
12200,Lynette,"and you made me lie to them, too, which brings up another question. did you know that perjury is, like, this whole big thing?"
8837,Lynette,they refused? they're six years old.make them.
11469,Lynette,"yeah? well, then why don't you come down to the restaurant and stop me? oh, that's right. you can't."
10578,Lynette,"yeah. no, wait. actually, wait.this is perfect.you know why? because we need some impartial judges."
11620,Lynette,"don't touch me! you have to go now. please, go. you have to go now. go on. go."
9306,Lynette,"more travel? tom, you're barely here half the time as it is. now you're going to have -- what, twice the work load?"
12455,Lynette,shh! he'll hear you.
11414,Lynette,"no, i know, but i've got a really good feeling about this guy, and all he wants is a fresh start."
13183,Lynette,it's a social networking tool where you send instant updates to anybody who signs up for them.
9137,Lynette,"no, no! i'm sorry! false alarm. we didn't find a body. uh, susan just had some really good news. sorry."
8954,Lynette,i thought the character of madame bovary was -- very inspirational.
8951,Lynette,"just being practical. isn't it better to settle this once and for all, rather than endure all this alpha mom crap until our kids graduate? hmmm? come on! i'll even let you take the first shot."
10990,Lynette,"hey, there they are!"
12773,Lynette,"look, tom, i can't talk now. just call bob. i'm going over there now. okay. bye."
10569,Lynette,"whoa. that's weird kind of feedback.you know?physics can be spooky that way.listen, i gotta go.i gotta go.ed is talking to me,and, um,i'll call you back later?"
9560,Lynette,"anyone is capable of anything. the first time we ever met, you were cheating!"
11191,Lynette,"come on, harry. you are my last holdout. what's it gonna take? cash? uh, free pizza for the rest of your life? you name it."
10858,Lynette,why?
12196,Lynette,i didn't go into work that night.
11715,Lynette,you heard about this from my kids?
11299,Lynette,"i shouldn't have to tell you every little thing, you know. show some initiative."
9677,Lynette,"well, that, that sounds great. thank you."
11879,Lynette,"this--is me, tom, not brandy or candy. it's just your wife, lynette. am i not enough for you?"
12578,Lynette,"scavo's was the adventure. we changed our whole lives so you could live out your dream, and now you're bored. we can't keep doing this, tom. we can't keep throwing all the cards up in the air every time you get a little restless. let's call it a night. we have to work tomorrow. are you coming?"
9440,Lynette,"no, because your husband was being a total jerk!"
11396,Lynette,love you!
10833,Lynette,"okay, well, maybe a little."
9422,Lynette,"yeah, well it's not working too well if you have to unload on a perfect stranger, is it? if you're unhappy in your marriage, do something, instead of just complaining, 'cause frankly, i don't want to hear it!"
10813,Lynette,"aw, you're sweet. bree, i'm sorry. i think you gotta follow your heart on this one, even if it isn't the easiest thing to do."
10733,Lynette,yeah? how can you be so sure?
9021,Lynette,"what? oh--right! okay, boys. this knot is called the bowline. it is a remarkably useful knot. now, pick up your ropes. okay. first we cross this end over here, and then we make a loop, and then another loop, and then you sort of pull it through, i'm guessing, and then, ready? yank it taut."
9474,Lynette,"i mean it this time, these are not just words. if you do this, so help me."
11379,Lynette,three months?
9004,Lynette,"slow down, you jerk, this is a residential neighborhood."
9315,Lynette,really?
11448,Lynette,"oh, this is awful. on a good night, we barely break even. tonight is gonna kill the whole week."
9707,Lynette,give it to her! give it to her!
12284,Lynette,"oh, we gotta take him to the hospital."
10553,Lynette,i am-- so happy and i'm so relieved.
10419,Lynette,"i don't either,but on the other hand,she spanked my kids,she lied about her drinking and i once saw her bitch slap her mother-in-law.so i'm torn."
8943,Lynette,"oh, that's very kind of you, but i just smoked some crack a little while ago, so i better not mix."
9098,Lynette,"does she, now? okay. harvey didn't like the turtles laughing, so he told them,"" "" i'll show you. one day i will fly higher than the birds!"
9415,Lynette,"are, are we supposed to be following them?"
12126,Lynette,i got time for that.
10424,Lynette,your lawyer came to see me.i'm going to be deposed.it's going to be hard for me--
10880,Lynette,don't tell me. you didn't sign a lease.
9463,Lynette,she spanked my son. i'm not apologising.
10979,Lynette,okay?
9013,Lynette,"oh, for the love of god!"
11225,Lynette,"crap, that's ed."
12716,Lynette,"i guess i have no other choice. but again, this is all in the strictest confidence. remember, you are my lawyer, not tom's."
9884,Lynette,"bree, wait, you're gonna have to explain. rex is dead. what could he have done to upset you?"
12946,Lynette,could you call him now?
12711,Lynette,"you're my lawyer, so anything i tell you is in confidence, right?"
11455,Lynette,for the appetizer portion. the entre is twenty.
9799,Lynette,"come on, come on, come on, come on, come on."
11456,Lynette,two. twenty-two. two.
11328,Lynette,"okay. okay. okay. if we're doing this, i need to buy you something. what do you want?"
13217,Lynette,"but i don't see your wrinkles, ttom. i see our whole life together. this--is you worrying about how you're going to provide for us. this is penny falling out of the tree house and breaking her arm. this is my cancer. these are the millions of laughs that got us through all those tough times. it's like a map of our marriage, and i don't want to lose it."
10747,Lynette,"please, tom, please!don't do this to me!"
12701,Lynette,then this is really not an alibi. it's more a confession to another crime.
11897,Lynette,i don't think katherine will bother herself over a tree house.
12230,Lynette,"that's true. i saw him. i was mad that he ditched me, so i went to drag his ass back inside. but when i saw him shouting at the radio, i decided i'll just wait and make his life miserable when we get home. so unless there's a law against choosing lebron james over your wife, i think we're done here."
11123,Lynette,"well, that's true, but she's sad."
11242,Lynette,"until he turned eighteen, which was a month ago."
11351,Lynette,are you speaking as my husband or as my boss?
10187,Lynette,"oh, not good. i am trying to salvage the pitch from the black's frozen yogurt campaign.you know what kills me?"
12210,Lynette,"okay, i-i'm gonna--i'll call you back in about five. bye."
8762,Lynette,"mrs. huber, i could never leave my kids by the side of the road."
12816,Lynette,"i had it in the back of my mind for a while, and then yesterday, i got a ph--"
9896,Lynette,"yeah, well, i haven't bought a new suit in six years."
12326,Lynette,"i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i shouldn't have done that, but that was--that was horrible, what you said. and--you should never say that again. okay, so--come on. let's go."
10039,Lynette,"oh, nina, come on."
9043,Lynette,ten. ten! each one more incompetent than the last. one actually asked me--here you go --if she was expected to change diapers.
10457,Lynette,"oh,wait a couple months. she'll start sleeping through the night."
12847,Lynette,"when times get tough, people do without things like pizza and sports cars."
9060,Lynette,i just want to talk.
10210,Lynette,what about penny?
12000,Lynette,"okay, she wasn't perfect, clearly. but she gave birth to us. we owe her our lives, and now that she needs us, we can't just turn our back on her."
12981,Lynette,idea--check local mental hospital for escaped married couple.
13107,Lynette,at work.
10891,Lynette,"hey, you."
10703,Lynette,what's wrong?
11391,Lynette,it's okay. i am gonna find a way to make this all work and you just get better.
11996,Lynette,why can't you take her? you are in that huge house all by yourself that you got from the divorce.
9183,Lynette,"no, you see, here's the thing -"
12570,Lynette,"well, i might not say anything. i might just put my finger to my ear and twirl it in small circles. we can't do something like that, tom."
8911,Lynette,"so if i went back to work, then you could stay home and take care of the kids."
12159,Lynette,"okay, what gives?"
8834,Lynette,are you sure? he's gonna freak.
12151,Lynette,"yeah, but how do you get the answers if you don't ask the questions?"
11682,Lynette,"oh, it's not as bad as it sounds. it's, um, hodgkin's lymphoma, and apparently, if you're going to get lymphoma, that's the kind you want."
13269,Lynette,are you sure it's not cancer?
13180,Lynette,"well, think inside. i made porkchops."
8706,Lynette,"oh, please, the man's gotten me pregnant three times in four years. i wish he was having sex with someone else."
12963,Lynette,"yes, like the greatest city in the world."
12622,Lynette,you're having sex with your best friend's mother?!
11324,Lynette,"oh, thank you.thank you, thank you."
13221,Lynette,"well, it seems like, based on your last visa records you've already been on vacation."
11254,Lynette,"you got it, ed."
8997,Lynette,thanks.
12369,Lynette,you sure you haven't been married before?
10700,Lynette,"more importantly, ever since he entered the picture, squeaky fromm is never around. it has been bliss! i haven't made this face. in a week. if you ruin this, so help me, i will hurt you!"
11608,Lynette,good night. come again.
10836,Lynette,#name?
10908,Lynette,"oh, just a quiet night with the girls."
11375,Lynette,"hello?hi.there's something wrong with my husband. i don't know. he's unconscious. 357 hawthorne place. okay, could you please hurry? thank you. yes."
9388,Lynette,"well, why are you standing there? get to it."
12999,Lynette,you think i'm a big risk?
10028,Lynette,"oh, he'll care. he doesn't want you suing him for millions of dollars."
10907,Lynette,hey.
12509,Lynette,aw--okay. well--i've got a whole bunch of alternatives.
9093,Lynette,that's good. it's good to have faith in people.
12855,Lynette,it would. but i can't. i wouldn't want it to affect our friendship.
9184,Lynette,okay.
11978,Lynette,what do you mean? i thought you were living with lucy.
12608,Lynette,you sure?
12644,Lynette,"warren, i'm sorry that"
10857,Lynette,"hey, parker, be careful up there.i just keep thinking he's gonna come to his senses and realize it's a bad idea."
10682,Lynette,i thought i told you tom took the kids to the movies.
12623,Lynette,i want you to call that woman and tell her you are never seeing her again.
9632,Lynette,so how are you doing?
9247,Lynette,you're capable of doing all sorts of things.
11159,Lynette,yeah?
10030,Lynette,"hey, pat, what's going on?"
9607,Lynette,no.
9420,Lynette,she's your wife. how can you talk about her like that?
11340,Lynette,"i had a lot of time to think tonight, and i realized you were right. we have to keep the romance going, no matter how tired we are. the only thing worse than just going through the motions is not bothering to go through the motions."
10849,Lynette,"no, that was a real frisbee to the head, that one."
12995,Lynette,y-you don't know?
9942,Lynette,wait!
10588,Lynette,what's this now?
12935,Lynette,"look, i know this is a crappy day for you, but we need to start thinking about what our plans are going to be."
11995,Lynette,i don't have any room for her. i already have seven people in four bedrooms.
12152,Lynette,i'm sorry. did i embarrass you on sunday?
12358,Lynette,"okay, then."
11549,Lynette,"oh, yeah, i'm more terrified of gaby. okay, good, good. we're almost home free--"
12764,Lynette,"oh, hello, mr. fishman."
10949,Lynette,"nora, please!"
9710,Lynette,why on earth would you let them finger paint before breakfast?
8871,Lynette,you're not having any more kids. what do you care?
10239,Lynette,"i told ed you were my husband,and he was cool with that.he really wants to hire you.so who am i to stand in the way?"
8752,Lynette,"i have no help, my husband's always away on business."
11419,Lynette,"okay, i know that, uh, tom has been a little cranky lately."
13248,Lynette,"i wanna be supportive. let's go for a nice dinner, get a bottle of wine--maybe two, since we don't have to wake up early tomorrow."
10252,Lynette,guys--
11435,Lynette,here you go. here you go.
9990,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
11181,Lynette,i'm gonna tell him. i'm gonna tell him i went to the restaurant and that i know he screwed up and that i'm gonna fix it.
10431,Lynette,"do you know a rat can fit through a hole the size of a quarter?anyway,my children have that trick down,too."
11236,Lynette,thanks.
10304,Lynette,hey!
11319,Lynette,yeah?
12053,Lynette,"mrs. mccluskey, please?"
9636,Lynette,"uh, you can, honey, if you can pay for it."
11404,Lynette,how old do you think i am?
13302,Lynette,"oh, yeah.i'll bite you good."
10126,Lynette,bye!mwah!
11823,Lynette,"are you kidding? it's genius. he's a sponge, but he talks!"
11309,Lynette,"oh, hey, hon."
8712,Lynette,no? i am your mother. you have to do what i say. come on.
9172,Lynette,yes! yes! i am mad at you.
10797,Lynette,"look, i was just making conversation. batter up!"
13181,Lynette,"oh, right. how'd that go?"
10528,Lynette,"what,what?"
12525,Lynette,oh.
9199,Lynette,"hey, rodney!"
10333,Lynette,"so you want me to,uh--pitch you as parents?"
12602,Lynette,why can't you do that at home? what the hell is this? you moving out on me?
9195,Lynette,"porter, don't you dare look at me like that. i will wipe that smirk right off your face. and don't think that i won't--"
9891,Lynette,"all right, so if i get my blue suit dry cleaned, will that be acceptable to everyone?"
9946,Lynette,"home, home movies. the fact is, we really don't care, and it's certainly no reason to keep our boys apart."
12872,Lynette,son of a--
12943,Lynette,seriously?
10781,Lynette,maybe?
9733,Lynette,hello? hi!
12849,Lynette,"actually, i have to go to work. but congratulations, bree. it's a beauty."
10489,Lynette,"i appreciate that.you know, ed--i don't wanna pry into your personal business,but if you are having problems in that area,you don't have to be resigned to it."
9825,Lynette,"no! no, no, no, no, no! it would help if you came up with some ideas."
9410,Lynette,"how can i ignore this? and i quote, 'it's not like she can hear.'"
10042,Lynette,does he know yet?
9668,Lynette,apparently rex's heart just gave out.
11705,Lynette,so forgiving my mother--that's my penance?
8776,Lynette,"oh, i don't think so. oh!"
11292,Lynette,only two.and the mailman had the good taste never to bring that up again.come on.let's go get some sleep.
12010,Lynette,okay. okay. i guess you're right.
10872,Lynette,"because you'll fail! i'm sorry! god.i shouldn't have said that.but you're gambling with our life savings, and you have no experience."
11421,Lynette,"wait, wait, wait! please don't do this. please. i am at the end of my rope."
13295,Lynette,"well, these are trained technicians and i've got a roast in the-freezer."
11543,Lynette,"trust me, we can both relax. i talked to her this morning, and she's out with victor all day."
13212,Lynette,that's my point. you don't know how these things will turn out.
12787,Lynette,"yeah, well, what can i tell ya? i learned from the best."
10743,Lynette,hey.
8898,Lynette,you think mike is a carl in disguise?
10455,Lynette,"oh,that's not important."
9508,Lynette,but if i'm wrong then i'm sucked into a two-hour conversation about bunions pilkingtons.
11896,Lynette,me? why would she do that?
10652,Lynette,"tom, could i, could i check your tie again?"
9957,Lynette,sure.
11531,Lynette,such food exists? don't tease me.
12441,Lynette,our brooding son has a classmate who got arrested for selling drugs. i really think the end justifies the means here.
11593,Lynette,"oh, crap."
10315,Lynette,"look,i apologize in advance for how this is going to sound,but i have to ask. it's just gonna eat away at me.were you drinking while baby-sitting my kids?"
13149,Lynette,"no, this is a really bad time for me. well, you did buy me that deodorant. ooh!"
12818,Lynette,"oh, please. you know it's gonna be a boy. it's always a boy. it's just gonna pee in my face and hide dead things in my shoes. i am doing this, tom. i am going after this job."
13091,Lynette,maybe they did. anybody seen any dead squirrels around here?
10882,Lynette,you leased a building without telling me?
13032,Lynette,do i spill my salary?
13146,Lynette,tom. what are you doing here? is everything all right?
11132,Lynette,"i know, i know. i know."
11320,Lynette,"before i forget, you got a call from chez nous confirming your reservation for our anniversary."
8980,Lynette,dana. wow. dana was a baby.
11876,Lynette,i'm not. whatcha got back there?
10618,Lynette,did it hurt for eight hours?
10027,Lynette,"stu, you're a gopher. you can't consent to anything. so, i think you should talk to ed about getting your job back."
8764,Lynette,goodbye.
8989,Lynette,"why not? start by targeting the top chain, then branch out from there. boom, boom, boom. mass saturation. oh, and you know what else would be a great idea? here's the thing --"
12967,Lynette,"okay. bruce, could you hold that thought? i'm gonna be right back."
9573,Lynette,we haven't had sex in ten days. and the longest we've ever gone before is nine.
13106,Lynette,come on!
13114,Lynette,"oh, crap. i'll be right there! aah!"
10986,Lynette,yeah. i never make cakes. this is huge.
9050,Lynette,"you know, i couldn't help but notice how wonderful you are with those children."
11730,Lynette,"no! no,i'm looking at the nightstand,and all i see are a few stray hairs and this sports blooper dvd you thought would cheer me up."
10338,Lynette,is it that bad?
11185,Lynette,oh!
13242,Lynette,"well, it's just so random, and the worst part is if i point that out, i'm a bitch."
10003,Lynette,"edie, how old were you when you lost your virginity?"
12173,Lynette,meh.
8736,Lynette,let's risk it?
9216,Lynette,"well, for starters, you can wipe that disgusting smirk off your face."
9584,Lynette,"there, now you have easier access."
10737,Lynette,ummm.
10280,Lynette,it was not that long ago that she keeled over in her front yard.a day with our kids will finish the job.
12249,Lynette,no. we can handle this in house. we can make sure they never do anything like this again.
10830,Lynette,two bribery scandals. gotta count the batting helmets.
13147,Lynette,"well, then what are you doing--here? oh, no. are you crazy?"
9503,Lynette,"yes, and it was a beautiful gesture. really. but i-"
9472,Lynette,what are you doing? don't. you. dare.
13274,Lynette,what am i gonna do about my job?
10386,Lynette,on page 6 is an example of the new print ad. check it out.
9932,Lynette,oh.
10770,Lynette,excuse me? did you smoke that bong before you beat the guy with it?
10465,Lynette,excuse me?
13268,Lynette,excuse me?
9851,Lynette,"so, go over there."
11638,Lynette,"oh, wow. well, i'd love to chat, but i have cheese to grate."
9997,Lynette,"no, stu! these people don't deserve muffins."
10848,Lynette,excuse me?
12954,Lynette,"okay. i was going to wait to tell you this when you were in a good mood, but i realize that's not gonna happen, so bree has a special guest tonight, her publisher--and as luck would have it, he's looking to hire a new marketing executive."
9722,Lynette,what in the world?
9047,Lynette,"look, at my old job, we didn't wait for good people to come to us. we went out and raided other companies. i don't see why it should be different when you're hiring a nanny."
11246,Lynette,here you go.
10844,Lynette,what are we celebrating?
9518,Lynette,we don't have to be friends. but we're two human beings living on the same piece of earth. we could at least help each other out once in a while.
12033,Lynette,oh. he seems nice.
13301,Lynette,huh?what's going on?
12411,Lynette,"i just need five seconds to bitch about tom, and then i'll-- oh, my god. your painter isn't done yet?"
10335,Lynette,oh! uh-- i guess.
10349,Lynette,hi! what's up?
10146,Lynette,see ya.
10636,Lynette,hi. did you get the check?
9906,Lynette,"well, actually, this was already in my closet. i just forgot about it."
13192,Lynette,"you're older? i'm sorry, i just cannot believe--that they're out of stuffed mushrooms. excuse me."
13309,Lynette,"yeah, that's it. give it to me."
9254,Lynette,do you know what physiological warfare means?
9165,Lynette,hi. come on in.
9899,Lynette,"all right, now you're being ridiculous."
11024,Lynette,"i am telling you, our neighbor is a pedophile, and i expect you to do something about it."
12899,Lynette,"if you're looking to get fed, it's gonna be a while."
12246,Lynette,how are they doing?
12460,Lynette,"what? no, i didn't."
11748,Lynette,hi!how are you?
11778,Lynette,i don't mind.
10757,Lynette,no! you're colorful.colorful in a way that might respond to medication.
12277,Lynette,you are.
10516,Lynette,"well,you've been working so hard,off on business trips all the time.tonight,we throw caution and cholesterol to the wind.you deserve a little comfort food."
11795,Lynette,"yeah, you told me, but, jeez, gaby,don't you care enough to make an effort?"
12375,Lynette,i'll get lee.
11235,Lynette,my pills! my pain pills are in my bag.
10482,Lynette,karl broke up with edie.
12228,Lynette,"no. i am saying that if anyone had an ax to grind, it's rick. maybe he set the fire himself so he could blame my husband."
12204,Lynette,but-- nothing ever happened between us. you have to believe me. come on!
12442,Lynette,"well, the good news is he really doesn't hang out with jimmy conrado. but i am a little worried about anita47, who told him cherry fruit pops are an aphrodisiac."
11546,Lynette,i was wrong. i was wrong. come on. follow me. follow me.
11664,Lynette,"the idiot told me he had feelings for me, which he never would've done if you hadn't pushed him, and now he's gone. it's all your fault."
9132,Lynette,about what?
11409,Lynette,hi! i'm home! and i've got good news. i found a new manager.
10987,Lynette,"yeah, i'm gonna make you a cake."
12110,Lynette,wait! you'll never find it i'll get it for you.
10628,Lynette,i don't see another way to make this work.we've gotta dip into the pensions.
12070,Lynette,i'm not gonna sit and watch my husband suffocate.
11881,Lynette,"escape from me, you mean?"
8975,Lynette,"i'm not going to forget about this, jordana."
13076,Lynette,less yakkin' more draggin'.
11127,Lynette,she is special. now sit down. come on.
12715,Lynette,no. the house is mortgaged to the teeth.
13233,Lynette,really?
8863,Lynette,"well,at least go upstairs.."
10787,Lynette,"it is not fake. there is not a team i know that could get along without their backup far right fielder. okay, come on, let's go practice."
11076,Lynette,i'll do the chips. you deal.
12621,Lynette,what are you talking about?
13187,Lynette,"oh, for god sakes, knock it off! i am not gonna let you feel sorry for yourself. you are tom scavo, damn it!"
12543,Lynette,don't give me that. you are having the kind of success i only dreamed of back in my ad days.
9190,Lynette,"oh, really? why?"
11460,Lynette,yeah?
13067,Lynette,"um, i--edie, i have chemo in half an hour."
12550,Lynette,"oh. penny. if you're thinking of taking that for a spin, i've got bad news. you're 9. hey, what's the matter, sweetie?"
9928,Lynette,"guys, what is this?"
9822,Lynette,"tom, he attacked a teacher with an umbrella."
12532,Lynette,whoop. still waiting.
11060,Lynette,"hey, hey! where have you been?"
10820,Lynette,whoa. where'd that come from?
8700,Lynette,"i know someone, who knows someone, who knows an elf. and if anyone of you acts up, so help me, i will call santa and tell him you want socks for christmas. you willing to risk that?"
11616,Lynette,"yes, flirting! that's it! it's what married people do, because we know there is a line you don't cross. and maybe i've gotten close to that line, and maybe i've enjoyed getting close to that line, but i have never once crossed it."
9094,Lynette,"all right. ""harvey: the flying turtle"". doesn't this look fun!"
12976,Lynette,"so i said to him,""je crois que c'est l'homme qui fait les chez d'oeuvres."" and he said to me,""non, lynette. ce sont les chez d'oeuvres qui font l'homme."""
11756,Lynette,i just didn't realize how tired i would be when i took this on.
12002,Lynette,i don't need your money. i can take care of my mother all by myself.
11426,Lynette,what?
13132,Lynette,"it's my fault. i should have just told tom the truth, although it turned out to be kind of a wash with the whole patty rizzo thing."
10847,Lynette,"okay, okay, i'm dying here. what's the dream?"
12477,Lynette,could you just--for a sec? come on. you know i'm right. you're far too busy for this.
9691,Lynette,ah.
12948,Lynette,does she know you painted it?
9253,Lynette,"all right, start with 'dear mrs. mccluskey.'"
11601,Lynette,we were robbed!
13121,Lynette,could you maybe step outside? i only do one show a day.
9250,Lynette,"well, we could go with the old hickory stick. it's a clich, but it's pretty effective. i know, we'll go with the spatula. the holes give it less wind resistance. moves faster."
9532,Lynette,"c'on, you can tell me. you still care about her, don't you, just a teeny tiny little bit?"
10409,Lynette,"well,it makes sense,i guess."
13018,Lynette,"okay. okay. not to pry, but when you said carlos took you to st. barths--"
9552,Lynette,"she is an old, old friend of your daddy's."
11767,Lynette,you're doing it again.
12360,Lynette,"no, i don't, but let's say i did. katherine has this aloof quality. it's like she's always trying to keep us at arm's length."
8719,Lynette,where're your brothers?
11886,Lynette,will you stop being so heroic?! i'm a cancer bi*ch! what?
9385,Lynette,that was not a smart thing to say.
11687,Lynette,"but, honey--"
10231,Lynette,"what, did you get recruited by another firm?did somebody cherry-pick ya?"
9831,Lynette,"well, isn't she nice. it's time for bed, so i'm gonna tuck you in, okay?"
13184,Lynette,i didn't keep it from you. it's just one of those tech things that you don't care about. it's for young people.
8833,Lynette,what if we separate the twins? put them in different classes? they're much calmer when they're not bouncing off one another.
11479,Lynette,"oh. oh, my god. if we serve this for tomorrow's special, will will clear four grand."
11142,Lynette,kids. they're always rough housing.
12908,Lynette,really? that doesn't sound like me.
11626,Lynette,"well, okay, then."
10230,Lynette,uh-huh. and how long did you stay?
10761,Lynette,"oh, lighten up. it's a joke."
10686,Lynette,"nora, look, i am sorry i lied.you know you gave me no choice."
10896,Lynette,we're numbing the pain of our miserable lives.
8808,Lynette,"sweetie, you know our rule about eating cookies, right?"
12137,Lynette,"great! just give me a second to sell tom on the idea. you know, he was raised catholic."
9188,Lynette,"ah. that was the best class ever. you can just terrific, thank you."
10258,Lynette,tell him you're done with the games.you don't wanna play anymore.
11693,Lynette,"listen, mom, i really appreciate you coming to help, but as you can see, i'm perfectly fine."
12454,Lynette,"okay-- remember how you told me i should stop talking to him online? well, of course, i didn't, and i sort of told him i liked his poetry."
12458,Lynette,go away.
10336,Lynette,i don't suppose you brought a corkscrew?
11407,Lynette,which is four more than we have.
9433,Lynette,"yes, that's not exactly what i--"
11512,Lynette,those are shameless rationalizations. keep them coming.
9237,Lynette,"i know, of course. you're not your father."
11565,Lynette,"oh, i missed you, too. hey, why don't you guys go grab that big table, and i will have rick whip something up for us?"
12813,Lynette,the doctor just called. i'm pregnant.
13003,Lynette,"well, if i was dumb enough to answer that, i never would've gotten into northwestern."
9032,Lynette,"well, we shouldn't. we should tell each other this stuff."
8789,Lynette,i'm still in.
11212,Lynette,wow. your father has taught you well.
13099,Lynette,"don't make plans on tuesday. we're having dinner at the solis' and--what's that look on your face? you didn't eat dairy again, did you?"
12852,Lynette,that must be nice. but--i can't accept it.
12078,Lynette,"damn it! i'm not gonna let you die, so don't make me drag you!"
10367,Lynette,what's going on?
8850,Lynette,yeah.
10549,Lynette,i didn't say anything.
12206,Lynette,the obnoxious backstabber just called your name.
12594,Lynette,what are you saying?
9189,Lynette,hi!
8794,Lynette,i was looking so forward to a night out.
9588,Lynette,fine.
11989,Lynette,"i told you, if you're gonna have a tree house--you've gotta keep it clean."
11054,Lynette,"he's not at our house, he's not in our yard. do not jerk me around."
10447,Lynette,so you think that now he's obsessed with--
13093,Lynette,"so who can come by later and check on him? i'd do it, but i'm working late."
9320,Lynette,long.
10444,Lynette,"oh,it doesn't.i'm just stalling because i am completely mortified."
12979,Lynette,so dinner--wow.
9425,Lynette,"hey, alisa, hey lily, how are you guys?"
12019,Lynette,"yes, yes, thank you, but where has she been staying?"
13207,Lynette,yeah. it turns out he got the same procedure that you're thinking about getting. so i thought maybe you could chat him up about it.
13014,Lynette,"i'm confused. before, you didn't even want to talk to him. you weren't even sure i was good."
12568,Lynette,"well, sheesh. oh. sweetie, we already got karen a candle. an r.v. might be overkill."
8702,Lynette,let's get this over with.
13024,Lynette,actually--i am kinda tired. i think i'm going to head inside.
11057,Lynette,"did you donate the photos, too? parker!"
10709,Lynette,"i just, i, i, you know, you don't wanna throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting."
11904,Lynette,"no, actually, i'm nominating myself. i am now running for president--against you."
11844,Lynette,what?
9007,Lynette,"i hope this works. my sleep cycle is totally out of whack. i'm up all night, i'm dozing off during the day."""
11226,Lynette,my boss is waiting for me outside in his car. what am i supposed to do?
13237,Lynette,so--you would be a college student-- again.
10400,Lynette,that's chocolate milk.i shouldn't be having it.have you ever had any?
11832,Lynette,yes! yes! yes!
9431,Lynette,i'm sorry but i can't understand you. you're gonna have to talk slower.
9280,Lynette,"i know, they've being punished. probably for life. but i needed you to see something. they said they stole it from mike's garage. from inside his work bench. your mike."
8909,Lynette,"well, you know how we both agree that one of us needs to stay home and parent the kids and one of us needs to go off and make a living. and then i suddenly remembered, when i was working i made a little more than you."
9344,Lynette,"yeah, not so cool now, huh?"
10998,Lynette,or wherever.
9595,Lynette,because she now comes to our house everyday to remind you of what i'm not.
13058,Lynette,hey.
11233,Lynette,"oh, son of a bi*ch!"
9417,Lynette,sorry. i should have mentioned that my tennis is much better than my cooking.
9841,Lynette,oh. goodie!
9877,Lynette,"well, you guys have fun. this is the fifth night in a row i haven't been home to tuck in my kids, so i'm gonna go."
12140,Lynette,i've got a question about his sermon.
12796,Lynette,"speaking of cashing in your chips, anyone know when eli's funeral is?"
10701,Lynette,"no, i'm good. could be a monkey."
10435,Lynette,"no,you don't.in fact,i hate liars."
12692,Lynette,a witness? i--
9082,Lynette,"i--don't want to--shock them, by suddenly disappearing. you know? deep down, they're very sensitive."
10740,Lynette,thanks.
12866,Lynette,right. glad i thought of it.
10612,Lynette,our daughter is officially named.you may go now.
12942,Lynette,yeah. he's up early today. he just doesn't know what he's doing next.
9866,Lynette,okay. one drink.
13101,Lynette,hmm. that's okay. i can see it from here. thrilling. mwah.
11431,Lynette,here you go. sorry for the wait.
8927,Lynette,"that would have never happened in boy scouts. when i worked, mostly with men, i preferred the way they fought. a guy takes his opponent on, face to face, and once he's won, he's top dog. it's primitive, but it's fair."
9835,Lynette,"no, can't say that i have."
12565,Lynette,"and when i was 12, i had a poster of shaun cassidy, but you don't see me driving around in him, do you?"
10310,Lynette,"okay,well,thanks."
9908,Lynette,okay.
11651,Lynette,"speaking of carlos, i hear he got evicted."
9434,Lynette,i didn't mean that you--
9815,Lynette,yes. we've met.
13051,Lynette,"i mean, it really is the kind of thing a relative should do. maybe it is, but we're in the car, on our way there, so stop your bitching."
13029,Lynette,"because you used me! at least when i asked you for a favor, i was up-front."
11802,Lynette,"oh, i'm gonna be sick."
11436,Lynette,"oh, my god, rick. i never got back to you. i am so sorry."
12500,Lynette,i'm sorry. what?
10547,Lynette,atlantic city?
10167,Lynette,thought about who i'd marry if you died?hmm. no.
12416,Lynette,and so we have decided to let you go to the homecoming dance tonight--
10487,Lynette,"okay.thanks.well,i'm gonna go back in my office and continue to feel like a huge pervert."
10144,Lynette,"that's okay.they don't trust you,either."
12763,Lynette,"i am so happy for you, but we're gonna miss you."
11386,Lynette,"yeah, but don't worry. i am gonna find you the assistant manager of your dreams."
10541,Lynette,i don't know.anything you wanna talk about?'cause there's nothing you couldn't tell me.i would understand.
9902,Lynette,"fine. i'll take them back. could you step out for a minute, please? i want to be alone with it for a little while."
13167,Lynette,i'm sorry. i was exhausted.
9929,Lynette,"oh my god! oh my god, where's the off button?"
12389,Lynette,"asked and answered. okay, that's it! everybody out. game's over. can i have your chair for a second? hey! look up here! mom's here. party's over. door's open. out you go. go on. shoo! you guys have pulled a lot of stupid stunts. but this? this? risking our liquor license, our livelihood?"
11056,Lynette,don't play dumb with me. i know exactly what is down here! where's the pinball? where's all the games?
12153,Lynette,"well, what if i need to? what if that's the kind of church i'm looking for?"
10966,Lynette,why not?
9123,Lynette,did you set up the coffee maker?
11121,Lynette,well--just this once.
9886,Lynette,"um, i wasn't planning to, uh, but why?"
9769,Lynette,"because we can't escape the fact that i have kids. i love my job, but to be fair, there's gotta be some balance."
12978,Lynette,"well, we've all had our troubles as bosses, haven't we, tom? i was sort of sugarcoating it when i said his restaurant was very successful. the truth is, he mismanaged that pizza joint right into the ground."
10684,Lynette,oh.
10061,Lynette,"kiss the kids good night and i'll see them in the morning. okay, yeah. i love you, too. bye-bye."
9934,Lynette,"yeah, okay, enough of that."
12330,Lynette,"again, i know i crossed the line, and i am so sorry."
9258,Lynette,what?
9136,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
9176,Lynette,"oh. that's sweet of you, but it's not exactly true."
9760,Lynette,"actually, your dad's gonna take you to school on your first day."
11202,Lynette,"okay, let's say just for the sake of argument, that someone else did. someone who clearly loves you very much. what's wrong with that?"
10749,Lynette,what are you doing here?
10768,Lynette,"oh, my god, nora. did you actually-- well, i'm-- i'm very sorry. i had no idea. but your life is better now, right? you have a beautiful daughter, and you have that fun job at the--pancake house."
12631,Lynette,i don't know.
11097,Lynette,"i heard about rebecca on the news. if there's anything i can do to help, i--with the funeral arrangements, or, uh--help you call relatives--"
10952,Lynette,"no!i-- we're--we have--we're sharing custody,and then,she tried to seduce my husband, so--"
10090,Lynette,"oh, cool. listen,i just wanted you to know i appreciated you backing me up last night,you know,with the kiss thing."
12502,Lynette,"you know, it's been years since i looked through this stuff. i'd forgotten i was--kinda great."
10119,Lynette,"good night, tom."
11976,Lynette,"you have money, right? i mean, you loaned us that $10,000."
11083,Lynette,"thanks so much, rita. i think it's such a good idea that we all get together and talk and--wow."
12011,Lynette,"the morgue is listed under government offices, right?"
10942,Lynette,even you have to admit kayla would be better off with us than in a dingy apartment over a tijuana strip club.
12101,Lynette,"well, we'd do anything for your aunt. i hope you know what an amazing woman she was."
11551,Lynette,"hey, gab. hi."
8783,Lynette,hey.
13131,Lynette,"drop it, tom. we'll continue this at home."
12433,Lynette,you were on the same little league team.
9224,Lynette,"yesterday, i came home, and i walked in on your dad with a woman. he's having an affair. i am so, so sorry. i know. are you okay?"
12661,Lynette,i saw a grown man beating up on my teenage boy. what else do you want to know?
11794,Lynette,"yeah, in any way that gets you out of this room."
12705,Lynette,"tom, your rock is trying to get fingerprints off a weapon. you mind? thanks."
12803,Lynette,"all right, time for my luck to change. this hand is for eli. hmm, next hand is for eli."
12626,Lynette,"gee, porter. that's just one of the pitfalls of dating a married woman."
13161,Lynette,okay. okay. we'll have sex. but can you make it quick?
8810,Lynette,"the kids are bouncing off the walls?huh. well i'm sure you can find a way to put them to bed, tom. i mean, for god's sakes, tom, they're just kids."
9984,Lynette,"just wait for it. okay, here he comes."
10769,Lynette,yeah.
9384,Lynette,"oh, please."
11736,Lynette,"okay,don't take this personally,but we hate you."
12136,Lynette,"well, i decided i should go to church today. yeah, tom said the same thing. anyway, since you're the most religious person i know, i was wondering if you would take us to your church."
11577,Lynette,what?
9284,Lynette,i needed you to see something.they said they stole it from mike's garage.
10330,Lynette,are you saying you gave your heart and soul to that eskimo pitch?
11545,Lynette,gaby's coming.
12345,Lynette,how did he die? was he beaten to death 'cause his name was maynard?
8985,Lynette,"i've got it covered, no problem."
12974,Lynette,"you know, tom, you're right. bruce does care about this job. that's why he wants to make sure he gets the perfect person for it."
13281,Lynette,oh!
9107,Lynette,really.
8732,Lynette,"well, is it ok if i just lie here?"
12439,Lynette,i am just--talking to porter on silverfizz.
12989,Lynette,"she's your boss? let her kiss you again, then sue her."
12684,Lynette,"of course it wasn't. of course. then we're gonna be okay, as long as you keep telling the truth. everything's gonna be fine."
12344,Lynette,maynard?
10594,Lynette,"i am not interested, and if you wanna keep those fingers, i would move 'em away from my body. thank you."
12822,Lynette,my hero.
9439,Lynette,"well, because--"
8746,Lynette,maybe it's just some sort of sick joke.
10552,Lynette,"i'm thinking, yeah, ruin it."
9356,Lynette,"okay. she's going through something, and i'm sure she'd prefer it to be private."
13061,Lynette,thanks. i can't get comfortable. could you fluff my pillows?
13007,Lynette,"it matters because i'm only 43, and i look like i'm 39."
12331,Lynette,"tom, if you had been there and heard what she said--"
10160,Lynette,"oh,it's just chicken pox.but brave heart here will only come in to sleep and shower."
11034,Lynette,"i am snapping because there is a monster across the street, and barney fife here is making me sound like the bad guy!"
10651,Lynette,uh.what are you doing there?
13113,Lynette,"carlos, you're early!"
8778,Lynette,"oh, crap."
11163,Lynette,fine! good night.
9234,Lynette,"i overreacted, i know. i'm sorry."
9566,Lynette,it's too late. you said it.
12212,Lynette,need a little caffeine fix?
11712,Lynette,"well, if history's any indicator, i won't have to wait long."
11474,Lynette,"oh, sure!"
12191,Lynette,"yeah, we're crazy that way. i don't know why you're complaining about handicapped spaces. doesn't carlos have one of those blue placards?"
10704,Lynette,"what? no! no, no, no. what happened?"
9664,Lynette,thank you.
10373,Lynette,"word is out all over town that you're unhappy at zimms,so why not jump ship and come to parcher & murphy?i swear, veronica,you would fit in so well here."
11973,Lynette,"come on. it must be driving you crazy living with five screaming kids underfoot. i don't blame you for wanting a little peace and quiet. you need to leave, mom."
13047,Lynette,no. i got a hole puncher. sorry. that's the best i could do. come on.
8725,Lynette,it's the best job i've ever had.
10481,Lynette,yeah?
9270,Lynette,"but why do i have to apologize? why don't we just go: ""oh, now we're even"" and we'll start from scratch."
11685,Lynette,"yep. dave lost his job at the plant, and he is now handing out flyers at a chicken restaurant, and--prepare to wince-- there is a chicken suit involved."
12185,Lynette,"oh, yeah?"
11475,Lynette,"hey, they didn't have jell-o, so i hope pudding is okay."
9426,Lynette,"um, sure. here,boys. stay right there."
10492,Lynette,"okay!uh, well,i hope that helped.and i'm just gonna go back and finish so we can all get out of here."
12693,Lynette,a witness? what are they talking about?
13209,Lynette,"bruce, i want you to meet my husband tom. tom, this is bruce."
10708,Lynette,i'm on the side of love. you guys seem like such a perfect couple.
10980,Lynette,"hi, bunny. i'll be right there."
12376,Lynette,"yeah, i can. sit down. earlier, my husband, in an attempt to help you with your relationship, mistakenly gave you some advice, which he would now like to take back. tom?"
10081,Lynette,"yeah.i know this sounds silly,but--it kind of bugged me."
10971,Lynette,"i thought they were little young to deal with their mother getting shot. all i told them is kayla is staying with her grandmother, and i made up a story about how i got hurt."
11519,Lynette,"hey, do you still want me to look at that book report?"
11204,Lynette,you can't drown in self-pity just because i helped you with one tiny little thing.
10735,Lynette,"no, no.what's unfair is that we're slowly running out of money and you've barely even looked for a job. you're going to have a good time, all right? i love you. bye."
11958,Lynette,shh! do you hear that? he's making his move.
12124,Lynette,"because it wasn't enough, not compared to what she did for me. she saved my kids. she's this amazing woman, and i never bothered to get to know her, so, yeah, i sprinkled her ashes, but it would have been nice to do something before she was ashes."
10604,Lynette,hey.
9214,Lynette,where are you going?
11980,Lynette,"ooh, look. the special is chicken. doesn't that sound good?"
10985,Lynette,i'm gonna make you a cake.
9986,Lynette,it's just stu from our office.
9548,Lynette,"tom, we're having a dinner party. i'm thinking of inviting annabel."
12047,Lynette,you can't be serious.
10422,Lynette,i can't believe you are old enough to drive.i still remember when you were 10 years old.i paid you a dollar to rake our leaves.
13297,Lynette,"uh-huh. is that why you didn't open the door? because of your hands? mrs mcclusky, do you have anyone who could help you out? a relative? a friend?"
9913,Lynette,"see? that's where i think we have been making a terrible, terrible mistake."
11025,Lynette,he's a single man with a basement full of toys!
9049,Lynette,is this seat taken?
10456,Lynette,"parker,i'm your mother.mothers don't lie to their sons.now go wash your hands or santa's not gonna bring you anything for christmas."
11302,Lynette,no. why would i order fifty high chairs for the opening of a pizzeria?
10879,Lynette,"well, i just don't. tom, you know how i feel about this pizza thing."
8819,Lynette,why not?
12076,Lynette,karen!
9322,Lynette,oh.
10920,Lynette,"hey! mary alice, are you okay?"
9780,Lynette,"oh, honey, i'm here. i'm here. you can show me your cubby now."
11868,Lynette,"you said ""no shower. but look around--men. so technically, it's a party, not a shower."
12453,Lynette,he may be in love with me.
11341,Lynette,knock yourself out.
11666,Lynette,this whole thing is ridiculous. i bumped my head.
9959,Lynette,"porter, preston, what have i told you about playing outside after dark?"
12936,Lynette,and that is so great. so when do you think that great thing might happen?
10341,Lynette,"tom,if you're gonna make a point,why don't you do it now before i hurl the plate at you?"
11085,Lynette,a protest?
13279,Lynette,"okay. so, now that i'm going to do some, heavy lifting, i believe i have a right to talk about the changes made to the script?"
10320,Lynette,"you put my kids in danger,and then you lied about it.do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?"
9601,Lynette,tucked in tight.
8724,Lynette,"well, to be honest--"
12739,Lynette,"tom, i talked to every kid in his english class, the entire debate team. porter hasn't contacted any of them. well, hurry home. we gotta decide what our next move is. all right. i love you. bye."
9545,Lynette,fantastic shape. she's gorgeous.
10186,Lynette,"well, can't we just--"
9561,Lynette,it's a pattern of behaviour.
8886,Lynette,c'on! i got you beat!
9628,Lynette,"he's apples, i'm oranges, we excel in different areas. trust me, you should give tom a look."
8754,Lynette,"and for you to stand there, and judge me."
9927,Lynette,"hey, guys. we got snacks!"
11330,Lynette,"i have been dragging my ass all day, and the only thought that's kept me going is the hot bath, and now i have do my hair and shave my legs."
11023,Lynette,hello?
12452,Lynette,porter sent me a sex poem.
11908,Lynette,"look, this is not just about a tree house or a fountain. this is about what kind of neighborhood we want to live in. do we get to make our own choices, or do we let the taste police make them for us?"
8964,Lynette,and when exactly would this formal dinner take place?
13168,Lynette,"oh, okay. i'm gonna let that one go, 'cause you're upset."
10585,Lynette,"guys?could you come here for a second?we need to have a serious talk. okay, we have had a great-- vacation, but tomorrow we're going home, except we're not going to our home. we're gonna go stay with grandma."
11981,Lynette,have fun.
10565,Lynette,great. great.they're in the day care room.i'm-- looking at 'em right now.
12487,Lynette,yeah. sure. come on in.
12987,Lynette,"so was it a good, old-fashioned american kiss or are we talking the infinitely superior french variety?"
11695,Lynette,"well, that's what you get when you mix chemo and vodka gimlets."
10346,Lynette,just eat it.
9119,Lynette,"you know, if we're going to buy a water heater, we should talk about it. we could go to the mall tomorrow. they're having a sale."
12071,Lynette,"karen, after all our years of friendship, how can you choose a cat over my husband?"
11614,Lynette,i don't know what you're talking about. there's nothing to admit.
12090,Lynette,"oh, my god."
12475,Lynette,what?
11210,Lynette,"oh, i'm sure it will be."
12318,Lynette,no. all my idea. i just wanted to treat you to a real fun day.
10102,Lynette,not at all.
10387,Lynette,"hey,hey,don't get me wrong.i find that as bizarreas you guys do.but right now this firm needs veronica more than she needs us.telling a mother how to raise her kids is an act of war.we will lose her."
9805,Lynette,"well, parker, we don't have time."
10869,Lynette,"start small, have an italian theme,create some cash flow, and then later on,expand into the pizza thing."
13010,Lynette,yeah! how'd you hear about it?
12618,Lynette,you know what? i have to kill you now.
10894,Lynette,you were trying to figure out how to kill edie without doing time.
9447,Lynette,that's me. never afraid to create a scene.
10388,Lynette,"yeah,well,we'll just ask her to keep the blinds always drawn when she nurses."
11505,Lynette,"hi, honey."
11837,Lynette,you drugged me.
11856,Lynette,"oh, okay."
12589,Lynette,sh-she was there? why?
11563,Lynette,"so--what--well, how did you get here? i mean, you're not supposed to--drive."
9483,Lynette,run by germans. hmm?
12548,Lynette,penny! let's go! time for bath!
11373,Lynette,tom! come on! i know you're still here. you realize what time it is? i know! you're mad. but you just--you can't avoid me all night.
10581,Lynette,"your family had eight sets of twins over three generations, not to mention your relatives in kentucky with triplets!triplets! so i ask you, do i not deserve to punish this man severely?"
9888,Lynette,another suit. i have other suits.
11323,Lynette,"i'm exhausted. honestly, all i wanna do is pawn the kids off on somebody else, take a long bath and be in bed by eight."
11776,Lynette,please let me help. i feel so guilty just sitting here.
9848,Lynette,"don't be ridiculous. could we get a trough of these, please?"
11694,Lynette,i'll manage. you got through breast cancer while raising the three of us alone.
8966,Lynette,you think? how am i supposed to pull off a formal dinner with no warning?
13030,Lynette,"oh, you found out about that?"
11734,Lynette,"hey,sweetie,what's up?"
10726,Lynette,uh oh.
10512,Lynette,"if you just fire him,he'll sue you,and i'll back him up.you need cause."
9505,Lynette,alright. okay. thank you.
10212,Lynette,"oh, it's just--i'm--i'm not sure that you would find this job that satisfying."
11873,Lynette,"well, penny wanted to play beauty school with the wig, and, well, let's just say she's got no future as a stylist."
12752,Lynette,"yesterday, you said warren schilling will kill porter if he gets the chance. i will never let that happen."
10232,Lynette,oh.
12262,Lynette,"you brought it up before, and in this case, i really don't think we have a choice."
10384,Lynette,"perfect! take your time.hey,honey.how's the big apple treating ya?good. did those,uh,snooty clients like your pitch?well,that's perfect.excellent."
11770,Lynette,by taking all the fun of the kill?
11091,Lynette,i know. but be fair. there is no way i could've anticipated this.
11713,Lynette,"i think at a certain point, people just are who they are."
12017,Lynette,she did? is she okay?
10034,Lynette,he did what?
11874,Lynette,oh.
9948,Lynette,"oh, no!"
11334,Lynette,wow.
12315,Lynette,oh. yow! it's a little pricey.
11207,Lynette,"i don't have to. you're always giving it to me, inspiring me. remember the mouthwash jingle? you came up with the hook. and--and what about the bartlett campaign? would i have ever come up with tango-dancing fleas? all you. there's nothing that i have accomplished that i could have done without your help."
11461,Lynette,"um, tom. . ."
12823,Lynette,"jeff cuevas is fantastic, but i know i could take his department to a whole new level."
12551,Lynette,what? of course not. why would you say something like that?
9742,Lynette,i forgot.
11652,Lynette,it could ruin your friendship. are you willing to take that chance?
10513,Lynette,so you think you and carlos will try for another adoption?
10246,Lynette,you've only been here a week.yhy don't you give yourself a break?
8982,Lynette,yep. he's a feisty one.
11453,Lynette,so--good news! our chef is preparing his special spaghetti carbonara.
9068,Lynette,what?
12278,Lynette,there are opportunities that you can see that--i'm not! what would be my agenda?
10767,Lynette,what happened to your ride?
12834,Lynette,could you hold on a second?
11917,Lynette,why don't you get earplugs?
11922,Lynette,"pay for a fence you don't even want. that's not how you make good neighbors, and i don't care if--"
10861,Lynette,mm-hmm. yeah.
12786,Lynette,you're gonna have to.
8913,Lynette,"aye, aye."
8884,Lynette,you're going to have some fun today.
12685,Lynette,what?
13135,Lynette,i got it. i'll be right up.
9708,Lynette,"oh, my god. i mean, i knew mary alice had killed herself over something big, but wow. can you imagine living with that guilt?"
10141,Lynette,"well, he is our friendly neighborhood murderer."
10089,Lynette,"hey, you're out early."
13231,Lynette,oh!
12040,Lynette,listen to me. i would be honored if you would come and live with us. having you around these past few months was sort of--fun.
10782,Lynette,"well, think about it, okay? cause whatever you wanna do, i'm in your corner."
11370,Lynette,yeah. we could hire a manager or something.
8740,Lynette,absolutely. she'll get through this. she'll find a way to survive.
10506,Lynette,you're getting divorced?
9943,Lynette,no!
10937,Lynette,"well, you're gonna love the neighborhood. are you all moved in?"
13164,Lynette,is there a problem?
8830,Lynette,why didn't she say anything?
11815,Lynette,"""kick-ass chronic""? uh-huh. you're a grandmother. shouldn't you be off somewhere knitting an afghan?"
10508,Lynette,you're gonna fire me?
9169,Lynette,i wish i would have known earlier. i would have arranged a sitter.
9369,Lynette,"oh. that is a load off my mind. well, thank you."
13261,Lynette,"i'm so proud. porter, aren't you gonna congratulate your father?"
10091,Lynette,"yeah, but i probably should've just gone with it.gaby was just being gaby--having fun."
11073,Lynette,you can defend him all you want. i know what i know.
13085,Lynette,urn is empty. let's do it.
8986,Lynette,"oh, you know what would be even better? dry cleaning bags."
12768,Lynette,what?
11361,Lynette,"you keep ordering me around and disagreeing with me and overuling me, and i'm sick of it. we have to do things my way at least every once in a while."
11147,Lynette,"hey, stranger."
10208,Lynette,oh!no! no!i do not think that that is a good idea.
11104,Lynette,of course you did.
12721,Lynette,thanks.
12382,Lynette,what the hell is going on?!
9405,Lynette,"i don't think we should be talking about alisa with her, so--"
9122,Lynette,hon?
12933,Lynette,"yeah, well, putting an ""everything must go"" sign kind of eroded our bargaining position."
11357,Lynette,"really, kim? 'cause--i heard one of your customers say that when halloween comes around, we should stick a candle in your mouth. see? morale. you guys need to stand up for yourselves. it's your right-no, it's your obligation to go to management and demand new shirts. and if management doesn't like it, you tell him he can go screw-!"
10314,Lynette,"well,i mean,i just don't understand how porter and preston managed to wrangle her into the stroller and then make it out your front door without you even noticing.i guess if you'd fallen asleep--it could've happened like that,i-i guess."
10295,Lynette,"well,uh,okay,i know how this looks,but i have to tell you,i left them with a very reliable baby-sitter."
10925,Lynette,"and that's what i did, nothing."
10570,Lynette,"okay, bye."
10919,Lynette,you will never again see my husband.
13019,Lynette,gaby didn't mention that.
9671,Lynette,"aw, sweetie."
10791,Lynette,i'll tell you what we're not doing--quitting.
10134,Lynette,"yeah, i can imagine."
12263,Lynette,"you didn't see her. she just sat there, playing with her doll with this kind of eerie calm."
12393,Lynette,what happened to your tenant?
9693,Lynette,thank you.
9365,Lynette,i keep thinking that maybe it was the petting zoo that i took them to last week. that llama was really iffy.
11870,Lynette,yeah. good as new.
10868,Lynette,i'm thinking--catering company.
12045,Lynette,sorry. can you say that again? i don't think i heard you right.
11714,Lynette,how did you-
12087,Lynette,"no. no, i guess not."
9299,Lynette,thank god.
9642,Lynette,could you talk to me for a second? i don't understand.
10111,Lynette,"maybe.yes.but gaby doesn't think she did anything wrong.that's not right,either."
10000,Lynette,"well, if one of you would just agree to raise my kids, i wouldn't need a job. any takers?"
12511,Lynette,no?
11618,Lynette,"yeah, i'm mad! i am mad because i loved our nights together. it made me feel sexy and happy, and, god, how i needed that. and now it's over. you ruined it. you can't work here anymore."
10454,Lynette,"and then the mommy and the daddy,because they love each other so much,they hug.real tight."
9500,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, i won't have any time tomorrow."
11245,Lynette,"this restaurant is gonna be a big, fat hit."
9427,Lynette,"so, how are you?"
10426,Lynette,"oh. sure.anyway,i just--i feel so guilty that this all went on in your house,right under our nose.so if there is anything i can do to help you--"
9720,Lynette,"yeah, i sorta did."
11496,Lynette,"she's reworked the lyrics to ""wind beneath my wings."""
11283,Lynette,"really. this place is your dream, so--consider them checked."
11161,Lynette,"ya think? 'cause i just saw a take-out menu with a six-digit phone number, and i kept that to myself."
11580,Lynette,"yeah, well, you know, it is, but i just don't want you to come back before you're ready. you might reinjure yourself."
9061,Lynette,"claire, claire, please."
9308,Lynette,i thought this was an in-house position.
11686,Lynette,so where are we gonna find this ten thousand dollars?
12712,Lynette,"i gave that money to anne schilling so she'd leave town, and tom has no idea."
12422,Lynette,whatcha doing?
9920,Lynette,"ah, no, it's, it's okay. believe me, my boys can take care of themselves."
12111,Lynette,here you go.
9667,Lynette,"oh, my cell phone."
10159,Lynette,"hi,carlos."
9394,Lynette,i'd love to.
13228,Lynette,i want you to get this stupid europe idea out of his head. take him on a tour of the campus. get him excited. show him college could be fun.
10095,Lynette,i am stunned.who was it with?
11659,Lynette,i said i'd have sex. i didn't say i'd make love.
13280,Lynette,all right. off you go. thanks.
10354,Lynette,"okay,okay,can i just mention you're talking like a crazy person?"
9517,Lynette,"let me tell you something: half of life is obligations. you don't want to go to your husband's company christmas party, but you do. you don't want to sell candy so your kids' band can play piccolos, but you do. you attend your third cousin's wedding. you pick up the dry cleaning. that's life. its obligation. and you are now my obligation. so tomorrow morning i'll pick you up and take you to the pharmacy."
10033,Lynette,why? what happened?
11470,Lynette,"hey, buddy, whatcha doing?"
10120,Lynette,shut up and go to sleep.
12831,Lynette,"tom, i am in pain. do you mind? you'll see, tom. i know. people say that you--you can't have it all, but i know we can."
11650,Lynette,"i think her point--and again, i wish she'd express herself a little more tactfully-- was that marriage is unpredictable. we can't know what it'll be until we're in it."
9964,Lynette,again? how often does this happen?
12032,Lynette,handle what?
9048,Lynette,"i'm not twisting anyone's arm. if i make a better offer, why shouldn't a qualified person reap the benefits? so come on--where can i score some high grade nanny?"
11708,Lynette,"aw, i think it's so great, and we could not be happier for you. when's your due date?"
9553,Lynette,"hold on, honey, grown ups are talking."
13026,Lynette,"well, it's probably nothing. but when carlos works on his computer at home, does he take his shirt off there, too?"
10707,Lynette,"okay, but he didn't, he didn't, and you know until--"
11970,Lynette,"we need to talk about this stan thing. oh, is that his name? stan?"
10066,Lynette,"hey! you know, the day care room won't be ready until next week at the earliest."
10441,Lynette,teeth?
10113,Lynette,i don't know.
12434,Lynette,no. not really.
9389,Lynette,"um, hi. i, i wanted to introduce myself to your mom. i'm lynette scavo."
9100,Lynette,no.
9055,Lynette,she sounds awful.
11105,Lynette,"okay,they're here. now listen, stand up. kayla has been through a lot, so when she walks in the door, i want you to make her feel welcome, okay? give her a hug and be really nice."
9783,Lynette,"nina, nature is calling."
12163,Lynette,"yes, and do you know why? because out of all my friends, you are the one who had real faith. you had an actual relationship with god. at least, that's what i thought."
11963,Lynette,i'm sorry.
13126,Lynette,you told her? i asked you not to.
8869,Lynette,yeah. i thought that was understood.
9424,Lynette,"thanks."" ""i'll play with you."
8937,Lynette,"oh jordana, you are really a lifesaver, thank you. here, these pieces need trim."
10637,Lynette,tom?!
13080,Lynette,"hey, travers. remember us?"
8912,Lynette,ah-ha!
11238,Lynette,see ya next week! thanks for understanding!
10131,Lynette,"all righty, then,my work here is done.carlos, gaby."
13270,Lynette,i went to the doctor today.
10984,Lynette,"i'm good. i just, how do i thank the man who saved my life?"
10923,Lynette,i haven't had it for months. i don't know why it came back.
10201,Lynette,they're calling me in for a meeting.i gotta go. love you. bye!
12403,Lynette,"yeah? ""creative"" like selling fake i.d.s was creative. and hot-wiring mccluskey's car-- that was a work of art."
12085,Lynette,"why can't we hear them? if my kids are alive, they would be yelling. tom would be yelling."
10192,Lynette,"come on, i'm sorry.i just really need to focus here."
12545,Lynette,"it is. you're at the start of an incredible journey, and i am going to be there every step of the way, cheering you on, telling anyone who will listen that the bree van de kamp is my friend."
8809,Lynette,"yeah, but tonight, anything goes. make sure you share with your brothers."
13305,Lynette,i'm on my way.
12396,Lynette,"and obviously i am not getting through to the twins, because no matter what i say, they keep pulling this crap, and i am sick of it."
12799,Lynette,"well, you've certainly had quite a glamorous life."
11901,Lynette,uh-huh. and what if they don't?
9126,Lynette,thanks.
12542,Lynette,drunk? jealous?
10288,Lynette,yes.
11561,Lynette,okay.
11171,Lynette,"yeah,i-i know.and hey,don't tell him i stopped by.i'm not supposed to be here.i just wanted to sneak a peek."
10497,Lynette,"you're an award-winning copywriter, ed.you get paid to write."
11010,Lynette,my kids are having a hard time. they're pretty freaked out by that whole supermarket thing.
11118,Lynette,"kayla, where you going?"
8737,Lynette,ooh!
12804,Lynette,how about we pick something from your cookbook?
10592,Lynette,he broke his arm.they took him up to x-ray.
11972,Lynette,"no, it was a big deal. you have taken amazing care of me. but i know you have so many things you wanna get back to."
10018,Lynette,"come on, nina, we both know why you got rid of him."
11312,Lynette,"okay, okay, we could point fingers, but what's important is forgetting about what we expected, and focusing on what we have, which isn't so bad. i mean, all the different kinds of chairs give the place a kind of bohemian vibe. plus, if we get a lot of babies, look, we're just totally set. tom, i'm sorry. i am. i'm sorry. i just, i realize it's not perfect. but--please say something."
10758,Lynette,"ah! oh, my god! knock it off! what is the matter with you?! what is wrong with you? what the hell do you think you're doing?"
10398,Lynette,ouch.
9421,Lynette,"all right, enough. if you've got issues with your wife, tell her."
12714,Lynette,what am i supposed to do? where am i gonna get that bail money?
11900,Lynette,i mean-- you're not gonna start checking everyone's yards for things that don't fit in?
9266,Lynette,"i need to know if my policy covers it. no, my car actually wasn't involved. it was my neighbor's car, but the egg was mine. uh huh. can i please speak to your supervisor?"
11885,Lynette,"no, i am. it's been months, and i have barely thought about what you're going through."
12363,Lynette,"bree's in a horrible jam, and i told her we'd help cater the commitment ceremony tomorrow."
9348,Lynette,i'll call. bree?
10811,Lynette,"absolutely. if he's cheating, he could bring home a disease."
9081,Lynette,"i'm going to cancel it. the boys are in rare form, and you're still finding your way."
11573,Lynette,we missed you.
11199,Lynette,you're home early.
10587,Lynette,would it be better if we came back at another time?
12428,Lynette,thank you. but you didn't have to--
12517,Lynette,stu!
11732,Lynette,i found it.
10548,Lynette,"yeah, how, indeed?"
12788,Lynette,"hey, mom. i just came by to tell you that the judge threw out porter's case for lack of evidence. isn't that great? mom--i did not put you in here to punish you. i didn't have a choice."
9565,Lynette,"well, that's just something that wives say to their husbands."
11821,Lynette,"wow, sweetie. those really look delicious, but i just don't feel like eating right now."
12135,Lynette,"well, i haven't. i have some questions i would like answered. and i don't know anything about god or jesus, and our kids don't either."
10978,Lynette,i've gotta--
8994,Lynette,"and when you work on a pitch, or you bring the partners over, i am reminded of a world i left behind where i was the winner, and people tried to keep up with me! i can't go back. i can't win where i am. i'm stuck in the middle, and it is really starting to get to me."
11622,Lynette,it was kind of dead tonight. hi.
12025,Lynette,why? mom cheated on you. no one blames you for leaving.
9310,Lynette,"so was mine, but i'm here, aren't i?"
12539,Lynette,"fine. and don't worry. even though i'd like to, i'm not gonna make some big, ugly scene."
10507,Lynette,what kind of terms?
13245,Lynette,that's your advice hope an opportunity just drops in my lap? might as well start shopping for beekeeper suits.
9231,Lynette,that man is not coming back in this house.
12401,Lynette,tom? can i talk to you a sec?
9127,Lynette,"just so you know, if we go to the mall, we can go to the shoe store. you said you wanted new running shoes."
9663,Lynette,"who? me? i've been out of work for seven years, i'm a woman of a certain age in a business that values youth above all else. why should i be nervous?"
12801,Lynette,that's so nice. we were just--
11820,Lynette,"tom, hair loss and constant nausea-- those are inconveniences. losing at charades to susan meyer--that is just flat-out intolerable."
9936,Lynette,"oh, norma. norma, we just thought you needed to know what happened."
11217,Lynette,yep. your father's taught you well.
11326,Lynette,what was that?
10688,Lynette,"no, no, no, no.you want in you're going to have to go through me."
10245,Lynette,"oh!hey, none of that in here."
10142,Lynette,that doesn't mean betty knew him.
9006,Lynette,an innocent woman gets hit by a car and the driver just takes off? i don't think it's extreme.
9498,Lynette,now's not a good time. i'm on my way out and i have a tonne of errands.
12708,Lynette,that's high. where are we gonna get that kind of money?
10255,Lynette,i don't care!you're not gonna do this!
12960,Lynette,yeah.
9653,Lynette,"tom, that's--crazy."
13033,Lynette,big deal. so is this coffee mug.
11558,Lynette,"hi, mrs.mccluskey. would you like some cake?"
8934,Lynette,my boys are the oak trees.
13199,Lynette,"you don't need a face-lift. what if i went out and got a boob job and came home with big, giant sideshow boobs? how would you like that?"
10666,Lynette,i told her that we were picking up kayla for a quiet afternoon at home.
9596,Lynette,"she's the fantasy, tom, the hot woman that you work with everyday. with her manicured nails and designer outfits. i am the reality. the wife who never wears make-up and whose clothes smell like a hamper."
11314,Lynette,"now it's ""us""? because i thought i was the one who was trying to ruin everything."
13124,Lynette,mm.
10676,Lynette,"okay, now, move it.i've got ten bucks here for the kid who can carry the most stuff. okay?"
8910,Lynette,"you tossed out that little sacrifice comment a while ago and it occurred to me,i've made sacrifices over the past six years. i gave up my career! if another sacrifice has to be made, i think it's your turn on the merry-go-round."
10279,Lynette,"well,for starters,she's ancient!"
12107,Lynette,"hey, i-if you don't have time to do it, i will."
9154,Lynette,i'm here for the 10 a.m. yoga meditation class.
10993,Lynette,or wherever.
11788,Lynette,yeah--kinda. can i pencil you in?
11585,Lynette,probably.we got a big party coming in at ten. so--mm-hmm. i'll just see you in the morning.
11935,Lynette,"katherine. what's with you? sometimes you act like an ice queen, and then you do something really nice. you are one complicated lady."
10360,Lynette,i'm sorry.i'm not following.
10640,Lynette,"well, to be honest, first, we bought you pie, then you tried to extort money from us."
12186,Lynette,so you're really okay with this?
11000,Lynette,"oh, jeez."
12595,Lynette,how do you know he didn't?
8890,Lynette,look at that concentration. porter loves his puzzles.
11968,Lynette,"oh, i was just telling everybody the good news about my--cancer."
10699,Lynette,you haven't even met him. he could be the sweetest man in the world.
12521,Lynette,huh.
10270,Lynette,thanks.could you scrounge me up a bucket?
10163,Lynette,we're not having any more kids.why would it matter?
10125,Lynette,"anyway, tom's probably got dinner ready by now.so i should get goin'."
12304,Lynette,could we revisit the foam bat idea for just a second?
9644,Lynette,you're just gonna stay here and play games all day?
9095,Lynette,i gave her the afternoon off. who wants to turn pages?
9461,Lynette,"yeah, you're right, bree, i've got a lot to learn about parenting. and i feel so blessed to be getting sage advice from such an impeccable mother like you. i mean your kids turned out perfect, as long as you don't count andrew. where is he again, hum? some kind of, uh, boot camp for juvenile delinquents."
9700,Lynette,it won't be an ongoing thing.
12112,Lynette,"well, here's the thing. i called the general manager to ask if we could scatter the ashes here, and he said absolutely not."
12890,Lynette,we're sort of broke.
12273,Lynette,you don't understand.
11769,Lynette,"oh, my god. are you letting me win?"
10108,Lynette,"i never said that.what i said was that it made me uncomfortable when you kissed him.it's obviously an issue for me.and yet, here you are, alone in my kitchen with my husband.so you tell me,are you hitting on him?"
9236,Lynette,"well, you knew your father was having an affair, and it didn't seem to bother you that much. and that worries me, because if you can find it in you to condone something like that, then what's gonna happen when you've been on the road for forty years?"
10250,Lynette,"pat, we're all here, send the call in as soon as you get it."
10664,Lynette,of course.
11139,Lynette,"okay, let's go."
12497,Lynette,"oh, and look, you signed it--""to lynette, the sweetest, most wonderful friend i've ever known."""
13157,Lynette,oh. didn't we already do it tonight?
11938,Lynette,in the garden there. has something been digging in there?
10043,Lynette,our company insurance policy. you ever bother to read it?
10619,Lynette,"okay, then."
10211,Lynette,what about the two of us working and living together?i think that could be a recipe for disaster.
12552,Lynette,oh. they're just being silly. they're always silly. that's why we won't be sad when they move out of the house. come on.
9743,Lynette,okay.
12299,Lynette,hmm?
8974,Lynette,"yeah. just three or four pills, i'm really hitting a wall here."
13227,Lynette,"i am just trying to help preston avoid the way marked ""unemployable loser."""
11219,Lynette,"tom, no. you can't. you can't. the pizzeria opens in a week, and that street fair is the best advertising we're gonna get."
12860,Lynette,this will just take a sec.
11751,Lynette,"aw,my hero. i can handle her."
9844,Lynette,"no, tom. she's gone."
12638,Lynette,i do. why do i have a sense you're gonna take it away from me?
11197,Lynette,glad you thought so.
12516,Lynette,"i'm telling you, the only thing staler than that ad campaign is this dinner roll."
10326,Lynette,hey.
12154,Lynette,okay.
10123,Lynette,so cute.'cause it's beautiful!
11277,Lynette,what is--
10051,Lynette,"oh, of course, of course, but we all have days when we're starting to lose it. wouldn't it be nice to have some place to take her before you want to strangle her?"
9456,Lynette,"bree, thanks again for watching my boys. you sure they weren't too much to handle?"
10237,Lynette,hey.
9741,Lynette,"oh, i'm so sorry. is she gonna be okay?"
11472,Lynette,"well, parker really wanted to come visit you. i'm gonna put a little water in these."
11260,Lynette,i can do that.
11670,Lynette,nothing happened. he's gone. it's over.
11703,Lynette,what's that supposed to mean?
13170,Lynette,"oh, would you stop with the book? you bought it at a car wash along with a pack of gum and an air freshener."
13063,Lynette,it's fine.
8942,Lynette,"seriously, you're taking your kids medication?"
10308,Lynette,that's ridiculous.
9509,Lynette,"six months from now when they find her mummified corpse at the bottom of the stairs what do i tell the kids? oh yeah, i let mrs mcclusky die."
8788,Lynette,i'm in.
9275,Lynette,the boys have something they'd like to say to you.
10877,Lynette,it's a dump! what are you thinking?
12051,Lynette,"we, me, tom, the kids, that family you've come to know and love."
12334,Lynette,"uh, one second. preston, you might wanna stop dropping your waffle on the floor, cause i'm still gonna make you eat it. so, uh, what's c.p.s.?"
12536,Lynette,"yeah, that's immaterial. what do you think of the coupons?"
12802,Lynette,"no, you don't have to do that."
11144,Lynette,"well, you gotta hand it to her. just when you think bree's thrown every conceivable theme party she hosts a ""shame on you for thinking my husband killed someone"" dinner."
10665,Lynette,and?
9658,Lynette,"oh, why on earth would you let them finger paint before breakfast?"
11388,Lynette,i'm the one that told you that.
12984,Lynette,oh! mwah.
10538,Lynette,hey. hey!i didn't know if you were coming back.
10792,Lynette,he's got five more games in the season. he made a commitment. he's gonna see it through.
11761,Lynette,"no. no,of course not.you know what? let's make a pact.no more secrets.from now on,we tell each other every shocking detail of our lives."
11831,Lynette,sorry.
12269,Lynette,"well, good, but sometimes when you go through hard things, it changes the way you think. maybe we have trouble telling the difference between what's right and what's wrong."
9193,Lynette,"sorry."" ""excuse me."
11006,Lynette,"hey, buddy, you've been reading comic books for a while. don't you wanna go and play?"
11424,Lynette,i hope.
9856,Lynette,"thanks. hey, nina."
12639,Lynette,"oh, yeah, i'm great. that's it?"
11332,Lynette,thank you.
11598,Lynette,a little. thanks for not letting me freeze last night.
12663,Lynette,"well, i was right there, detective. my son said no such thing."
9699,Lynette,"hi. guys, i'd like you to meet penny. she gives me all my best ideas."
10934,Lynette,i am right there with you.
11906,Lynette,because you'd never win. bossy women rule this street. you know that.
9290,Lynette,i thought you liked tim doogan.
12168,Lynette,hi there.
12733,Lynette,"bob, we're so sorry. we meant to tell you. we really did."
12042,Lynette,but where will you live?
8818,Lynette,"i don't know. rex announced that he and bree are in counselling. she retaliated with this whole revelation which i won't even go into now. and the bottom line is, he stormed out. clearly there's trouble in paradise."
10766,Lynette,"see?this is what you do. you just manipulate. you wormed your way into my family. you conned your way into coming on this trip with me, and now you wanna force me into saving you. well, forget it! you wanna go, go."
11692,Lynette,just say thank you.
8768,Lynette,"boys? boys? boys?? if you're hiding, you've gotta stop now cause mommy doesn't think it's funny!"
11500,Lynette,"oh, please, i don't want to think of how many times she brought them ice cream from that basement. i mean, jeez, if you want to keep your husband on ice, at least have a dedicated freezer."
12448,Lynette,is that my yeats book? i love his poetry.
12671,Lynette,we're going to protect our son.
12243,Lynette,"oh, sweetie, i am so sorry. i bet that really scared you, didn't it?"
9701,Lynette,not until i change her diaper. could you just give me two minutes?
10945,Lynette,tell him i said to share. now put daddy on.
10437,Lynette,formula.
10579,Lynette,"let's suppose your husband begged you to get pregnant-- begged you--and out of the goodness of your heart, you agreed, even though it might derail your career.you agreed to a baby.a baby, singular."
10399,Lynette,"oh,i'm sorry,honey.your mom-- is in her office on a conference call,and she's busy,so you're just gonna have to wait,okay?"
10533,Lynette,"you sure?i might punch you,too."
11364,Lynette,no.
9251,Lynette,"guys, guys, guys, hey, my hands are tied. thieves get spanked. just the way it works. unless--"
11011,Lynette,not so much them.
10745,Lynette,"oh, well why don't you take a muscle relaxant."
12510,Lynette,"you don't have to. i'll be the bad guy. just tell 'em you've hired me, and i'll go in there, six-guns ablazing. so--do we have a deal? just give me the word."
10795,Lynette,"hey, did i tell you that, uh, burnham fox is looking for a new creative director?"
9534,Lynette,"talk to peterson, maybe he can get her transferred. weren't you guys talking about setting something up in belize?"
12245,Lynette,"oh, my god."
12031,Lynette,"drop it? do you hear that? she wants me to drop it. and when she cheated on you, and when she wrecked our family, i bet she wanted you to drop that, too."
9577,Lynette,bye.
11564,Lynette,"yeah, a little."
11452,Lynette,okay.
12889,Lynette,yeah--i think it's a little late for that.
9715,Lynette,"see, that's what i would call a flaw in the system."
11925,Lynette,"fascism, ida, not fashion."
12059,Lynette,"hey, we're here!"
11701,Lynette,"tom, you don't know half the stuff she did to us. she would get drunk and smack us around. she would meet some new guy and then drop us off at her sister's for a week because he wasn't into kids."
11533,Lynette,"no, i love it. it's--it's just that's a little late for me, and--"
11135,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry,but we gotta go. i have a dinner party i have to get to."
9432,Lynette,"well, yeah!"
13090,Lynette,"go ahead, susan. what are your four words for edie?"
10982,Lynette,"uh, yeah."
12614,Lynette,"yeah, at this point, i think i'm gonna need a little bit more than that."
12097,Lynette,how did i not know this?
10727,Lynette,they are just two random people who met at a wedding. can't pin it on me.
12991,Lynette,"hey, gaby? i'll see ya. i wanted to ask you something. feel free to say no."
9458,Lynette,"now when you say punishment, what exactly are you talking about?"
9843,Lynette,oh. don't you worry? i'm here.
11088,Lynette,"but, see, the only reason they fired him is because people were gossiping, and the only reason they're gossiping is because of what i told mrs. mccluskey."
10075,Lynette,"this is communication. this is good. why don't you guys go down to the lobby, talk it out over some coffee?"
12104,Lynette,"yeah, you stopping there anyway to spread your aunt's ashes?"
10395,Lynette,the people in this office feel a little--concerned--that you're nursing a boy of donovan's age.
11544,Lynette,down! down! down! aah!
9038,Lynette,"while you're gone, i'll be here, paying bills and sorting laundry and cooking dinner, so what part of that sounds like a vacation?"
13066,Lynette,love it? i have cancer. i probably shouldn't even use the ladies' room
10748,Lynette,"allllll right. yeah.i will be there as soon as i can.god, i hate my life."
9443,Lynette,i don't know. i guess i just have it in my head that only bad people break up marriages and offend the handicapped.
8977,Lynette,"great, this will keep the crab dip warm. it took forever to shell the little buggers, but it'll be worth it."
12681,Lynette,"oh. listen, we need to talk."
12222,Lynette,"oh, my god! stop it! what are you doing? stop. hey, easy. easy. just stop it! oh!"
10154,Lynette,"oh,you've gotta be kidding!i have to get back to work!"
9506,Lynette,she never leaves her mail sitting out there. i mean how many times has she thrown ours away because we didn't pick it up the minute it came.
10724,Lynette,"hey, i just brought two lost souls together. okay, how about this? he cheated on my friend. he deserves every bit of crazy she's gonna rain down on him."
9263,Lynette,nobody in my family knows or cares where your stupid clock is.
11508,Lynette,"ah, is this your way of guilting me into coming back home?"
8856,Lynette,stay right there.
12009,Lynette,"it is a lot easier to resent your parents when you know they're safe in some retirement village, but to know that she's out there, maybe lying facedown in an alley--"
10364,Lynette,"oh,yes!of course you do.still,you gotta love the thunderbolt."
10951,Lynette,"nora, shut up!"
10366,Lynette,"nicholson will be coming in in about 15 minutes with a pitch,so let's grab everybody and make sure we're all on the same page."
10725,Lynette,what are they doing?
12007,Lynette,she's broke and old and rude. that is not a winning combination on the street.
13206,Lynette,"honey, i'm glad you're home. i brought someone home from work i want you to meet."
12367,Lynette,"oh, tom. don't you know an urban myth when you hear one?"
11584,Lynette,"well, don't think so much. just rest and get better. that's what you need to do."
10964,Lynette,okay. i'll see you later.
11381,Lynette,"yeah, it is."
9152,Lynette,"hi, i understand your agency handles nannies. uh, i need someone experienced and preferably unattractive."
11214,Lynette,come on. you and your brothers will be thrilled. don't you get tired of me yelling at you to clean up your room and finish your homework?
11967,Lynette,"i have to get checked every six months, but, yes, the doctor is very optimistic."
10162,Lynette,"see you later.i'm sorry,what did he mean,""shooting blanks""?"
11265,Lynette,"okay, just for that, you get to help me take out the trash. i know you think i'm being a hard-ass, but i'm just looking for a basic level of professionalism that--"
12740,Lynette,"preston, why didn't you pick up when i called you?"
9978,Lynette,"give me a break. you know our kids. i love them dearly, but that goes in one ear and out the other."
13130,Lynette,cause it's patty rizzo. she's a total slut. you should be on antibiotics just for sitting in her car.
10190,Lynette,"no, that's okay.i know you're exhausted.you should go to bed."
9956,Lynette,hi.
9181,Lynette,"uh, it kind of snuck up on us."
11046,Lynette,"hey, hey, not now, parker."
11719,Lynette,how can you say that?
12676,Lynette,"i'm helping you help me. this way, you get to start a new life, and i get to not have you around while my son is going through all this."
12958,Lynette,he's being modest. he was the best.
12828,Lynette,we agreed i could go back to work after i gave birth.
12408,Lynette,"are we redefining ""cool"" to include playing trombone in the marching band?"
12535,Lynette,"zip it, stewie."
9316,Lynette,"yeah, he certainly did."
10405,Lynette,huh?
12064,Lynette,what?
9358,Lynette,because it's personal. it's the kind of thing she would only want me to tell her friends.
9966,Lynette,"and for good reason. someone could have driven off with them, and you wouldn't have even noticed."
12023,Lynette,"fine, the backseat, but you're just gonna spoil her."
10702,Lynette,"nora, what are you doing back? are you okay?"
9249,Lynette,"too late, you stole and then you lied. even worse? you made me look bad in front of mrs. mccluskey, who you know is mommy's sworn enemy. time to pick your poison. how 'bout a belt? it's a classic."
10016,Lynette,you fired stu?
12553,Lynette,"yes, but daddy's gonna live to a ripe old age unless he doesn't get home in time for mrs. mccluskey's party, and then all bets are off. oh, daddy's gonna be fine. come on."
9768,Lynette,"i know, i promised i wouldn't do this, but parker really needs me to be there on his first day of kindergarten. he's so freaked out i can't be there."
10368,Lynette,"ah,yeah--"
12755,Lynette,and you will convince him to come back home. shut the door.
9832,Lynette,"i know things have been hard for you since i started back to work, but it is just as hard for me to be away from you. and, you just have to remember that even when i'm not around, my love for you is real. you may not be able to see it, but it's not imaginary like mrs. mulberry. it's real. okay, honey?"
13145,Lynette,"i know, and i'm really sorry. listen, i gotta go. i will call you later. i love you. bye."
13258,Lynette,that's--a brilliant plan. why didn't you tell me this?
11150,Lynette,hi.
12404,Lynette,"oh, my god."
11100,Lynette,you can't stay here.
10015,Lynette,"oh. well, welcome. what happened to stu?"
9972,Lynette,"hi, guys."
10130,Lynette,"okay,let's test that theory."
13038,Lynette,"oh, yeah. i plan to get drunk and bitch about my boss."
9220,Lynette,we're not done here.
10536,Lynette,what? that can't be right.
9465,Lynette,"that is not the point, you don't spank other people's children."
8947,Lynette,"okay, lady, that's it!"
9395,Lynette,"even better, let's just keep it adults."
9818,Lynette,no. no. why?
10794,Lynette,"well, it's called parenting, tom.watch and learn.okay, p-dog, this is a curveball. again, opening the eyes--can't stress it enough."
10050,Lynette,"i'm not suggesting that you sign her up for all day. maybe just a couple of hours in the afternoon. wouldn't that be great? have some time to yourself, relax, unwind?"
8866,Lynette,"that's nice of you. and since we're talking about it, there's something else nice i'd like you to do. your kids both went to barcliff academy, didn't they?"
10337,Lynette,"oh,right,i was talking to susan on the phone,and i left it in a little longer than i should've. sorry."
12649,Lynette,oh! she's asleep. she's fine.
11095,Lynette,"well, that's my home, and i don't feel very safe right now. please, please, all of you, just leave this street. please, i beg of you. go! just get off my street, please!"
11317,Lynette,"hey. it's after nine. come on, thomasina, it's time to get up."
13249,Lynette,"oh, tom. you and tequila? what a great idea."
11224,Lynette,"i can't call in sick after eight weeks of sick leave, especially when i've been fine for three of them."
12015,Lynette,"oh, god. only three decades give or take a year, but who cares? oh, gosh. you look great."
12120,Lynette,"okay, split up, and i'll meet you back at the car. go!"
10020,Lynette,black?
11316,Lynette,"i think what my husband is trying to say is, if you really want to test a marriage, open a restaurant together. anyway, thank you for coming. eat a lot and come back, 'cause our kids need braces."
12627,Lynette,"well, then you have put her in a very dangerous position, haven't you?"
8932,Lynette,"well, that's what's so great about being in a democracy. everyone is entitled to their opinion. also, everyone has a right to vote. so all in favor of the woodsman going medieval on the big bad wolf's ass--"
10633,Lynette,"i know we're using up a huge chunk of our savings, but if it keeps that crazy woman out of our life,it is the best money we have ever spent.we will be okay."
11999,Lynette,"okay, but the point is, she went."
12492,Lynette,you mean his junk?
9786,Lynette,"no, no, i'm just, i'm very excited. it's a really good plan. yeah."
11520,Lynette,oh. okay.
9582,Lynette,what are you thinking?
9968,Lynette,i'm sorry. i've been doing this for seven years. trust me. you have to have eyes in the back of your head.
11525,Lynette,"hey, hey!"
9898,Lynette,"whoa, hold on a sec."
11036,Lynette,take a nap.
11411,Lynette,"yeah, i had that exact same thought. and to be honest, he has a history."
12368,Lynette,"mm-hmm. uh, chicken marsala, and pasta for the vegetarians."
13225,Lynette,"hey, focus. our son is throwing his life away. we have got to keep him on track."
10573,Lynette,"yeah. hang on.i'll call you later. okay, bye."
10182,Lynette,"oh,please."
10668,Lynette,so what are you saying?you're more afraid of nora that you are of me?
10681,Lynette,"hey, nora, wow.we weren't expecting you until seven."
9626,Lynette,"yeah, he's been thinking about making a move for a while. he kind of feels like he's done everything he can where he is now."
11946,Lynette,"sweetie, let me ask you something. if you had to choose between mommy's beautiful garden and a gross, mean, dirty possum, what would you pick?"
9789,Lynette,yeah.
9924,Lynette,"rest assured, we have not forgotten. see ya!"
11575,Lynette,"i just talked to mrs.mccluskey, and she is gonna start looking after our kids again."
10379,Lynette,parcher & murphy is completely mother-friendly.no one would say a word.
9864,Lynette,ah.
9885,Lynette,"great, great, no problem."
12757,Lynette,porter--you have got to come home. everything will be fine. i promise.
11940,Lynette,"well, we gotta do something about this."
9215,Lynette,"you know, the house isn't that big, rodney. you're going to have to stop avoiding me."
8817,Lynette,"well, there was dinner, but it wasn't much of a party."
8933,Lynette,"oh, yeah, huh, it was a creative call. look, i'm in the middle of a costume crisis, and if i don't take a few shortcuts, i'll never finish."
10917,Lynette,"your association with my family is over. when kayla comes to visit, you will drop her at the end of the block. you will never again see my husband, and if you try to, i will do to your spine what i just did to your front door. nod if you understand."
13005,Lynette,i'm 54.
11267,Lynette,are you high?
10132,Lynette,"oh, hey, carlos.hi."
9398,Lynette,why?
13286,Lynette,really--
12652,Lynette,"excuse me. gaby, have you seen porter?"
10493,Lynette,"god,i don't know.i'm gonna go check with ed."
13291,Lynette,"please christy, there is no way that i can get another babysitter this late in the day."
8828,Lynette,how in the world did they?
12275,Lynette,"and i wouldn't have done that unless i thought we had a serious problem, which we do."
10656,Lynette,"fine, fine, no absolutely fine. put crazy' at the end and we'll crop her out later."
9938,Lynette,"they need to know we don't judge them for what they do in the privacy of their own home. and, well, it's not unheard of to tape yourself while you're having sex."
8894,Lynette,umgophers.
10180,Lynette,what happened?
11733,Lynette,"look,i can deal with the chemo.i can deal with people telling me my hair has never looked better.but what i cannot deal with is the pity,so we are doing it my way."
9218,Lynette,it's not complicated. it's completely irresponsible.
12388,Lynette,"oh, yeah? why didn't you play at home? why did you have to sneak in here?"
10265,Lynette,i'm calling you out.
12824,Lynette,"oh, my water broke. take the overnight bag out to the car. oh, three weeks. that's a little soon, but, uh, sure, i could make that work."
10402,Lynette,hey.what's wrong?
13062,Lynette,"before you go, would you put my socks back on? my feet are cold again."
10323,Lynette,it feels a little familiar.
11126,Lynette,i don't care. we have rules.
9079,Lynette,"yeah? well, brussel sprouts help you grow. you don't want to be short your whole life, do you? here, look, you know what we'll do? we're gonna dip them in a little cheese. here you go. good, yummy!"
12603,Lynette,"so you can have your affair--you know, the one that follows the sports car and the garage band and wanting to quit your job, the final stage of your midlife crisis. oh, and then--when i hear anne schilling has been dropping by--"
8836,Lynette,"hi, i got your message. what's going on?"
8705,Lynette,even the limp ones aren't that ethical.
8793,Lynette,i already got a sitter.
8735,Lynette,yeah.
8727,Lynette,"hey, yeah!"
12333,Lynette,hi.
11358,Lynette,"okay, okay. break's over, people. i'm gonna go find tom and talk. oh! good."
11574,Lynette,okay.
9977,Lynette,you're smiling like that actually meant something.
10904,Lynette,"look, susan, god called you a cab."
12727,Lynette,tom
8917,Lynette,"i'm sorry, aren't we doing little red riding hood?"
12143,Lynette,"but here's where you lost me--""god's love is as sure as the sunlight."""
12294,Lynette,yeah?
9578,Lynette,"okay, you boys, it's seven o'clock. time for bed."
10025,Lynette,being intimate. and nina fired you to keep ed from finding out.
11562,Lynette,hey! hi! what are you doing here?
9015,Lynette,"look, i'm on my last nerves, so i'm going to level with you. i've screwed up my entire system by taking my system by taking my kids'add medication. yeah, that's right, you heard me. i plan to stop, but right now i need to sleep, and i need more than a few, crappy, needles, so whattya got?"
13239,Lynette,which is?
10191,Lynette,we've got-- nothing.
12688,Lynette,the first person who steps foot out that door will lose a leg.
11093,Lynette,okay.
12308,Lynette,"okay, first of all, you're, like, the greatest mom ever to wanna protect danielle like that."
11380,Lynette,we run a restaurant.
10391,Lynette,"okay. but for the record,the team is made up of wimps."
8936,Lynette,"bree, i totally understand. yeah, i already tried susan. and gabby can't sew to save her life but seriously, i'm going to be fine. but thanks anyway. bye!"
11325,Lynette,we can still have sex. just try not to wake me.
12226,Lynette,"if you insist on questioning my husband about a crime he didn't commit, you should at least have all the facts."
12498,Lynette,ha ha ha .could i see that? i'd love to read it.
11743,Lynette,he's gonna be watching for me all day.he's one of the leads.
11927,Lynette,"hey, judas."
9600,Lynette,hey.
8960,Lynette,thanks.
9673,Lynette,a girl. and three boys.
11842,Lynette,i get it. but if you ever pull something like this again--
13255,Lynette,i'm sure it wasn't that bad.
10693,Lynette,"well, we are happy to pitch in."
12182,Lynette,hey.
11891,Lynette,what?
12349,Lynette,what? why? wh--for what?
12272,Lynette,"what? no. sweetie, we don't need to do that."
10563,Lynette,"hey! great.great. how's atlantic city?are you, um, winning some money?"
13031,Lynette,"okay, it's true. i used you to get more money, but you used me first."
11624,Lynette,"well, he got a better offer from some place across town."
11138,Lynette,"mm-hmm. okay. boys, go to the car. i'll be out in a minute. go. listen, sweetheart, i don't blame you for being angry. your mom's gone,and you're stuck with me. but--the last thing she said to me was, ""promise you'll take care of kayla,"" and i am going to. but you're gonna have to help me, okay?"
8969,Lynette,"yeah, it's good for your career. i'll pull it off."
9109,Lynette,bye.
9514,Lynette,yeah.
11921,Lynette,"looks fine to me. it's hardly ripped at all. in fact, if you give me your support--"
9252,Lynette,"for a first time offense, if you swear, cross your heart, that you will never, never steal again, and you write mrs. mccluskey a letter of apology, i will let it slide."
12241,Lynette,"yes, of course."
11501,Lynette,"well, so far, she's only been charged with improper disposal of a corpse."
8750,Lynette,"i yelled at them. they never listen to me, it's very frustrating."
11602,Lynette,"yeah. no, i'm fine."
11243,Lynette,here you go. you can come back for seconds. our famous pepperoni pizza.
9634,Lynette,you're gonna lose it?
11741,Lynette,shhhhh!
13105,Lynette,tom!
9374,Lynette,"i'm begging you. they've already been uninvited from a birthday party, a really big birthday party with a bouncy house and a hot dog stand and a clown."
9681,Lynette,okay. come on. give me your feet.
12910,Lynette,"kids, we are going to support your father by working in his restaurant."
10294,Lynette,"yes! yeah,no,i know."
13282,Lynette,why didn't you ever tell me this?
12874,Lynette,you'll still be a celebrity in five minutes. come on.
13116,Lynette,mm-hmm.
9201,Lynette,"yeah, i'm gonna get right on that."
9428,Lynette,what?
13043,Lynette,i'm--not sure what you're talking about.
9745,Lynette,"oh, did he now?"
12940,Lynette,i think we have the kind of friendship where you don't have to say anything. let's just hug and move on. okay?
10322,Lynette,"no.i'm worried about her,but i don't know how i'm gonna get over what she did."
9571,Lynette,it's nothing.
11936,Lynette,it feels like i've ruined their childhood.
9305,Lynette,"no. no, you didn't."
10147,Lynette,what's wrong? pat said you told her it was an emergency!
12297,Lynette,so we were sort of surprised to get your call. don't you need to see kayla a few more times before you report back to us?
13025,Lynette,what? no. i'm sure she's just affectionate.
9778,Lynette,"damn. i forgot my prospectus. any extra copies? no? oh, i'll be right back."
10537,Lynette,that doesn't make any sense.there's gotta be some kind of an explanation for this.
9392,Lynette,"oh hi. nice to meet you, lily."
11473,Lynette,yeah?
11356,Lynette,"focus, people! the subject is shirts. it's killing morale."
11855,Lynette,it's 9:30.
13216,Lynette,"yes. you are going to look at me someday with your brand-new face and say, ""when did she get so old?"" we won't look like we belong together anymore."
12779,Lynette,mom--this is wrong. please.
10363,Lynette,"yeah,yeah.gotta love the thunderbolt."
10596,Lynette,i don't care what her name is.
12833,Lynette,yeah?
13142,Lynette,"did you remember to get my, um--my special deodorant?"
12913,Lynette,thanks. and do you have the calzones for table three?
9688,Lynette,you!
10706,Lynette,"okay, whoa, whoa, take a deep breath. you don't wanna break up with a guy because, in a weak moment, he calls you a whore."
11372,Lynette,i'm an idiot. would you guys mind--
12114,Lynette,do you maybe want to say something first?
10912,Lynette,ding-dong.
11640,Lynette,tom--
10780,Lynette,"okay, let's call that the backup plan. but, seriously, don't you have some road not taken, some dream you never got around to?"
12307,Lynette,"hey, bree, perfect timing. we were just getting ready to deal the cards."
11442,Lynette,why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint?
9645,Lynette,tom.
12169,Lynette,huh. that's nice of you.
11298,Lynette,did you finish folding the takeout menus?
12695,Lynette,like why do the police have a witness?
10297,Lynette,what?!
13287,Lynette,could you hold her?
9811,Lynette,"no! i'm not going to get the damn umbrella! i'm so sorry, sweetie. i am not mad at you."
10765,Lynette,"all right, now look, you've gone from crazy to stupid. this guy could be dangerous."
11094,Lynette,stop it! stop it! you can't do this to people! have you lost your minds?!
8842,Lynette,"like this mug , i love this mug. if i medicate them, are they still going to make me a mug like this?"
10221,Lynette,what do you think you're doing?
12878,Lynette,"oh, sure. it's only money, right?"
9660,Lynette,"oh, i have a thousand things to do before that. borrow a decent scarf from bree, buy a lipstick i don't hate."
9909,Lynette,"just hear me out. i was gonna take it back, i swear."
10078,Lynette,"hi, bunny, bunny. hi."
10647,Lynette,kayla ready yet?
10421,Lynette,"yeah,you think so?why don't you come over here for a second?i'd like to pick your brain.you're the demographic that my client is interested in,so you'd actually be doing me a favor if you drove it around for a couple hours,and tell me what you thought.do you mind?"
10161,Lynette,see ya later.
10566,Lynette,"okay. sure.first,can i talk to jerry?"
9897,Lynette,i'm willing to make sacrifices.
9014,Lynette,"knock it off, you little monsters."
10674,Lynette,"oh, i will, i will.and i'll see you tonight."
12052,Lynette,yeah.
9847,Lynette,it's a gimlet. you'll love it.
12835,Lynette,"oh, my god. oh, my god. i was on the phone. i was talking to my new boss, and i--"
10602,Lynette,you have no idea how badly you scared me.
11912,Lynette,but what?
11754,Lynette,"i'm sorry,sweetie.i'm just-- i'm just too tired right now."
10963,Lynette,"hey! mary alice, are you okay?"
11481,Lynette,"i mean, unless you'd like to go. you're here so late all the time."
10777,Lynette,"well, you're under a lot of stress. you got a new kid in the family. you're job hunting."
8758,Lynette,"no, no."
13177,Lynette,so--what do you want to do? hmm? what are you passionate about?
12895,Lynette,"okay--as much as i love tommy scavo's improve theater, we need to face some facts here."
12383,Lynette,"we always knew he'd do something like this eventually, and he did."
10692,Lynette,"personally, i love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser you can't beat chicken."
8888,Lynette,i can still see your heads. the pool's not deep enough.
9480,Lynette,"oh, that's cute. that's great. here, give them here."
9781,Lynette,"okay. i'll be back in two seconds, sweetie."
12894,Lynette,"so now we have pretend customers? gee, let's think of something to do with all the pretend money we're gonna make."
10256,Lynette,"that's because ed gets off on humiliating you.please, don't do this!"
10721,Lynette,all of them? what about jerry? jerry's fun.
13171,Lynette,don't just walk away.
13202,Lynette,"oh, my husband wants to spend money we don't have on a face-lift he doesn't need, so--not great."
9905,Lynette,i don't follow you.
11205,Lynette,why haven't you told me about all of this?
12400,Lynette,sorry.
13229,Lynette,"if you're really stopping by there, bring home some onion rings."
12559,Lynette,hey.
13152,Lynette,now? i'm kind of busy!
11068,Lynette,our neighbor is a pedophile.
9228,Lynette,"impressed? impressed? i-tom, please, please don't tell me you're all right with this!"
12105,Lynette,you can't do that. ida wanted her ashes scattered at the field.
12569,Lynette,"oh, don't. i like my mind the way it is."
12858,Lynette,"if we do well, you get a cut of the profits. if we go belly-up, we liquidate, and you get the first $20,000. and then, of course, my family moves in with you. so--do we have a deal?"
11143,Lynette,so you have been in canada this entire time?
11289,Lynette,it's good.
9105,Lynette,you had a nanny?
10158,Lynette,"hey,guys."
11466,Lynette,"we've been open for three months now, and we've barely turned a profit!"
11291,Lynette,"hey, chill out. you're acting like i did when i was six months pregnant."
10599,Lynette,uhh!
12012,Lynette,you're waiting outside. why are you waiting outside?
12095,Lynette,no.
9075,Lynette,i've got a nanny--
12073,Lynette,what are you talking about? i had you over for lemonade last week.
12544,Lynette,"no. but watching you, i look down on me. when i held your book in my hands, i felt so jealous my stomach hurt. and i thought, if i could just hitch a ride, have a piece of it, i wouldn't feel so bad about your success."
9814,Lynette,"so, what did parker do?"
10545,Lynette,maybe you do.
9784,Lynette,yes!
9156,Lynette,"uh, lauren? i'm a mother of four. today i had to get up at five, make lunches, make breakfast, drop the twins off at school, and get across town lugging a baby and a sick child. telling me to plan ahead is like telling me to sprout wings. and it's things like being told to plan ahead that make me so crazy, that yoga is the only thing that relaxes me, except i show up here, and i can't get in, and you tell me to plan ahead. it's a vicious cycle. see how that works?"
11441,Lynette,i can't do this. it's just--
9919,Lynette,is that true? did they beat you up?
13065,Lynette,been here before?
12646,Lynette,get off of her! get off of her! i'm calling the police!
11605,Lynette,"i was doing receipts, and rick surprised me with this great idea for the menu. it's called--what are they called?"
11158,Lynette,"might there be a v.i.p. preview for people, say, who bore your children?"
12827,Lynette,could you hold on one second?
12686,Lynette,oh.
9613,Lynette,"tom, i don't care about you working with annabel. i told you that. this is for duggan. he had a heart attack. i don't care about annabel."
12655,Lynette,don't you touch him! don't you touch him! go home now!
10372,Lynette,okay.
10092,Lynette,what do you mean?
12295,Lynette,"oh, well, thank you. it's beautiful. thank you."
9933,Lynette,"yeah, um, before that happens--"
11998,Lynette,"i really wanna meet this jackass. okay, we all have our excuses, but we gotta figure something out. come on. she is our mother."
9027,Lynette,"oh, susan, you gotta take my kids for a while."
10151,Lynette,"well,you never told me that."
10642,Lynette,sort of.
10860,Lynette,"oh, great. so, uh, tom will drop her off at your house on friday."
11247,Lynette,"load me up again, would ya?"
9535,Lynette,"no. i'm serious. if she stays, i will haunt your office. i will bring you lunch everyday. i will bring the kids to visit. i will change diapers on your desk. every birthday cake in the break room, every retirement party, i will be there. watching her."
12877,Lynette,"well, they probably would have loved my pizza, too, but we'll never know, because my partner threw it in the garbage. what a waste."
9179,Lynette,"we're, we're ten minutes early."
9209,Lynette,"oh, parker, um, forgot his catcher's mitt."
13277,Lynette,i'll do it.
8877,Lynette,it's not really so much scary as highly developed.
10649,Lynette,"all right, let's do this.i'm just going to check the focus."
13075,Lynette,she never let me forget it either. she always insisted it was the tequila shooters that killed the cancer.
9346,Lynette,i don't get it. i don't get who would pay maisy for sex.
11780,Lynette,"he was getting so emotional. it felt like the last 20 minutes of ""brian's song"". so--i guess i'm in the market for a new chemo buddy."
8990,Lynette,i was just participating.
13125,Lynette,"hey, is this gorgonzola?"
13158,Lynette,"oh, they're all starting to blur. look, i worked till 3:00 a.m. last night. i'm exhausted. how about we take a rain check?"
12630,Lynette,"but if you don't end this, you won't have to leave. we will throw you out."
11688,Lynette,should you even be playing tennis after your back surgery?
10886,Lynette,"well, that sort of depends on daddy."
12127,Lynette,"well, we heard you were having a rough time."
11869,Lynette,hi.
11401,Lynette,rick coletti?
11301,Lynette,yes.
11893,Lynette,"got it. sick talk done, okay? you guys have fun."
11611,Lynette,that's funny. he didn't mention it.
10135,Lynette,"oh, well,i'm not surprised,and i really, really hope you can work it out."
9487,Lynette,"you're going to the hospital, mrs mcclusky. you're going to be fine."
9246,Lynette,that's a good point.
9965,Lynette,"tom, it's nine o'clock at night."
9949,Lynette,"well, from a lay perspective, it looked very professional."
13294,Lynette,"hi, mrs binks, is patty there? thank you."
11690,Lynette,mom--
10491,Lynette,"okay, well,that wasn't my best work,but you can't deny results.i.m.ing works,and when i go home tonight,tom and i are going to--okay, well,i'm gonna be exhausted,so i'll probably just lay there.but trust ,tom is gonna go to town."
10730,Lynette,you're right. you are right. you're right. i'm so sorry. it's just--
10442,Lynette,"so,um--your message said that parker had been involved in some sort of serious incident.what--what kind of incident?"
11806,Lynette,"we should go, too. get a few drinks in her, see if she loosens up."
8771,Lynette,"i have 4 kids under the age of six, i absolutely have anger management issues."
9976,Lynette,"so, what if the stranger says they're gonna take you to the circus for pizza and elephant rides? don't look at your dad. eyes on me. what are you gonna do? what are you gonna do?"
9672,Lynette,i was a stay-at-home mom. i wish it had taken time off.
12795,Lynette,i have no idea.
11583,Lynette,yeah. i think firing him would be a huge mistake.
11524,Lynette,"i stay late because there's a lot of work to do, and right now i'm the only person who can do it, and now i have to go to the grocery store because i am the only person who can do that, mm-hmm. so why don't you go upstairs and finish your homework?"
12859,Lynette,hi.
10622,Lynette,and you must be nora.
9194,Lynette,"--okay, your 30 seconds is up now. get back here, get back here, get back here. i want the toys picked up. how many times do i have to tell you, pick up your toys! you want a spanking? is that what you want?"
12965,Lynette,"yeah. i was account executive for eight years, vp for four more after that, and by the way, i wrote my graduate thesis on the rise of the nonfiction novel."
13172,Lynette,"see this? my third espresso. i'm wired. no way i'm falling asleep tonight. hey. how about we throw a pizza on the front lawn, and when the kids run out to get it, we lock the door and do it in every room in the house? tom, i'm sorry. i don't know what else to say. if you wanna stay mad, i guess you're gonna stay mad."
9911,Lynette,and you know what else? i kicked ass in that meeting because of this suit.
12194,Lynette,vandalism? porter! preston! get over here!
11653,Lynette,what did he have to say?
12060,Lynette,"oh. sorry. kinda get used to it. come here. give that to mama. hey, guys? come on now. knock it off. here you go. and-- first base, second base, third base, sit. we gonna have a nice, quiet tornado watch, and nobody's gonna cause any problems."
11642,Lynette,i am not answering that. this is not a therapy session.
11755,Lynette,i know.the timing is terrible.
13252,Lynette,"who cares what time it is? we were celebrating a big change in your dad's life. hey, someone called."
9040,Lynette,"tom, our last version of normal had me popping pills. normal is a bad, bad plan."
10616,Lynette,"sweetie, sometimes when you're at work, and i'm home alone with three young boys, i'm not so happy, and now i'm gonna be alone with four kids. each one is a blessing, yes, but i don't think i can take any more-- blessings.more blessings could make me lose my mind.do you understand?"
9685,Lynette,"tom, being a mom is like being an e.r. doctor. there are no days off, so get up! get up!"
10117,Lynette,"thank you.thank you for reminding me that i am the only woman in the whole world who could love an ""idiot"" like you.i'll talk to gaby."
10884,Lynette,my mistake. i assumed you'd have a dream worth supporting.
8766,Lynette,"out. can't behave, you heard me, can't ride. you, out. move it."
11122,Lynette,"okay, okay, i know what you're thinking, but--kayla's going through a hard time right now. come and sit down. letting her watch tv is like me letting you eat ice cream when you're sick."
12167,Lynette,"why didn't you ask? oh, that's right. you don't like asking questions."
9599,Lynette,you should go. you don't want to keep annabel waiting.
10227,Lynette,okay!
10172,Lynette,do you have any idea how painful it is to hear about you even think about your next wife and kids?i could never do that!i can't imagine my life without you.you are my everything!
9575,Lynette,whatever.
11188,Lynette,i bet you were quite the player.
9803,Lynette,"hello, mrs. mulberry. don't forget to buckle up."
11270,Lynette,austin?
11253,Lynette,"like i said, really, really wrong, but if you take me back, i swear i will give you one hundred percent."
13045,Lynette,"well, i'll admit it's kind of flimsy, but until i got something better--"
11518,Lynette,hello?
10205,Lynette,yeah?
13300,Lynette,hi.
12809,Lynette,that's penny. i'll be right back.
9476,Lynette,now go brush your teeth and i want them to sparkle. go on.
11966,Lynette,"well, the results are back, and while you can never actually say you're cured--"
13292,Lynette,"parker, knock it off."
10532,Lynette,"he's not answering his cell phone.but you don't have to worry,okay?you got what you wanted.he's out of the building."
12765,Lynette,"uh, is everything okay?"
10901,Lynette,"yeah, he's hot."
11248,Lynette,"i'm gonna go poach some customers from that sausage-on-a-stick guy. oh, i love it. scavo's pizzeria! try the smoked chicken and sundried tomato."
9197,Lynette,"i'm not gonna drop you. i might strangle you for climbing up here in the first place. but drop you, no. come on!"
10679,Lynette,"okay, all right, everybody's in."
13276,Lynette,"no, tom. we're having twins--again."
9319,Lynette,okay.
9303,Lynette,you called your boss a fool?
12068,Lynette,you okay?
12115,Lynette,that was lovely.
9485,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, are you alright?"
12449,Lynette,"aah, this is the kind of poetry that melts a girl's heart. so romantic. oh! here's a great one--""the lover tells of the rose in his heart."" my first boyfriend gave me this poem. i was a junior in"
11810,Lynette,"oh. no, thanks."
12415,Lynette,"and while i thought grounding you was an appropriate punishment, your dad convinced me. i was being a little too hard on you guys."
8711,Lynette,"you three planned this?? alright, that's it. get out!"
12616,Lynette,that's what you were afraid of?
12985,Lynette,"hey, tom. no, still waiting. big surprise. they're running behind at an ad agency. so did any of those other places call back? seriously? six interviews and nothin'? well, i should probably try and keep my game face on here. i'll--i'll call you later. i love you. bye."
10905,Lynette,"mm-hmm. yeah, you are!"
10065,Lynette,"you're doing the right thing, ed, for little mindy."
11318,Lynette,"more, but i'm tougher, and i complain less."
11252,Lynette,"wait, ed! ed, please don't go. yes, i lied, and that was wrong, but my husband needed my help."
10278,Lynette,"a million teenagers in this neighborhood,and you hire mccluskey?"
10577,Lynette,hi.
11092,Lynette,"excuse me, can you tell me what happened?"""
9318,Lynette,"of course, i mean, i will miss him being gone all the time. he'll be bringing in more money, but he is gonna miss the birthdays, baseball games, first steps. that's the trade-off, right? i just hope one day tom doesn't look back and regret being gone so much. i better get out there before they break something."
11432,Lynette,i will be right there!
9227,Lynette,you knew about this?
11383,Lynette,how much of a while?
11542,Lynette,looks like we're working the same corner.
12008,Lynette,"lucy, lydia and i fought over who had to take her. she was right outside. god only knows what she heard us say."
12956,Lynette,and brush your teeth. my eyes are watering. and don't just wet the toothbrush. i can tell.
10331,Lynette,"did you give it 100%?well,exactly. so? big deal.go work up some new ideas,and then we'll go over it during lunch.okay?"
8944,Lynette,"jordana, maisy, here are the costumes, right on time."
9134,Lynette,you don't say.
10911,Lynette,mmm. so what happened tonight?
9570,Lynette,"that's your car pool. you've got to go, never mind."
12728,Lynette,it's not just money.
13185,Lynette,i didn't say that. you're not gonna get a whole lot of sympathy from me. i just went through the same thing. remember?
8839,Lynette,oh.. which one goes and which one stays?
12698,Lynette,"okay, we're gonna talk about that later. you were saying?"
11864,Lynette,"gaby, i'm not a redhead."
9995,Lynette,"nina, i think i speak for everyone here when i say we are sick and tired of your abuse. frankly, you owe us an apology."
8955,Lynette,really?
13035,Lynette,"isn't she fun? hey, carlos. did i ever tell you that tom a i seriously considered you and gaby for penny's godparents?"
9337,Lynette,what'd tammy want?
11631,Lynette,"well, daddy probably didn't notice that i was unloading twenty-pound bags of flour 'cause he still can't lift them, so mommy didn't exactly have time to sit around and chew the fat."
12027,Lynette,"ah, there's booze-illa now."
9104,Lynette,"well, trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be. you know, our mothers were smart. they didn't get us nannies or put us in day care, because they knew, if they did, we'd find out - there are other women out there who were better mothers than they were!"
10774,Lynette,he said that to you? he's never told me that.
11648,Lynette,"yeah, a little."
13139,Lynette,jeez! two seconds!
12577,Lynette,and i had cancer. i get it. i get it. you want your life to count for something.
10443,Lynette,what kind of cookie?
11791,Lynette,"no, no, i don't need magazines. i need company. sit down. you've been bouncing around since you got here. so--how do you like being the first lady of fairview?"
11304,Lynette,"animatronic rats. where do they find you people? okay, okay, here it is. see? i ordered fifty of item number seven three--"
11047,Lynette,i thought you were gonna mow the lawn.
12941,Lynette,he's doing great.
13201,Lynette,i'm not getting a boob job.
10223,Lynette,what does that mean?
12039,Lynette,"if i understood why you couldn't stay married to the only father, the only stable parent i'd ever known, yeah, i could've found a way to forgive you all sorts of things. we can talk about this later. let's go home."
9813,Lynette,i'm so sorry i couldn't get here sooner. i forgot my husband had to take our youngest to the pediatrician--
8914,Lynette,i'm not surprised that he's playing it close to the vest. paul knows we're on to him.
9334,Lynette,"yeah, here. see? it's this little white thing. look. it looks like a --"
12387,Lynette,what the hell's going on here?
10325,Lynette,"yeah. no,i get the subtle distinction.i think we can do better.okay? so,sally,you're up.what do you got for me?"
8807,Lynette,"preston, would you come here?"
11691,Lynette,"it's been five years, mom. they don't remember you."
11345,Lynette,"oh, crap. i left it at home again."
13001,Lynette,yep. thank you.
12735,Lynette,what do you mean?
9980,Lynette,"hey, stu. you busy?"
9925,Lynette,don't worry.
12264,Lynette,"no, you're missing my point."
8827,Lynette,i have a theory.
10903,Lynette,"i brought this on myself. i tell tom, i want you to be your own man.' but the truth is, i don't. i want him to have what he wants if it's what i want. i'm a bitch with a capital c."
10632,Lynette,"tom!i am trying very hard to be strong right now, and you melting down is not helping me."
9648,Lynette,i don't know what to say.
13166,Lynette,oh. was it good?
9958,Lynette,you should hold onto that stuff for a while.
12199,Lynette,"hey, guys, would you go play in the back for a while? i need to talk to your dad. thanks."
11610,Lynette,you okay? you've been so quiet all night.
12494,Lynette,"so--now my marriage is in trouble, and you're gonna save it by giving tom a bass?"
11817,Lynette,sorry.
9003,Lynette,this is awful. carlos must be just devastated.
9033,Lynette,"yeah, it really does."
10974,Lynette,yeah--
10856,Lynette,yeah--how's that divorce going?
8704,Lynette,please tell me you punched him.
13100,Lynette,oh.
10319,Lynette,"on any given day,how many glasses of wine do you put away?"
10088,Lynette,me neither.
12562,Lynette,but it doesn't matter because you're not dying.
12248,Lynette,"tom, they're not serial killers. they're two little boys who were afraid their parents were breaking up."
10822,Lynette,"i just figured, since you're taking your time figuring out what your dream even is, you might wanna make a few bucks in the meantime. i have a dream, too. it includes keeping this house."
12286,Lynette,"it's okay, sweetie. you're gonna be just fine. there."
9730,Lynette,"no, tom! tom, no! i'm gonna change the sheets!"
11771,Lynette,out.
12508,Lynette,i see women really responding to that.
11415,Lynette,"i can't find somebody else. i've interviewed fifty guys and this junkie happens to be the best of the bunch. seriously, tom, i don't know how much longer i--"
12912,Lynette,"all right, that's a large mushroom pepperoni pizza and two salads. i'll get that started. tom, i got need a large---"
12794,Lynette,"at least twice a week, and sometimes i'd bring the kids."
10139,Lynette,i-- don't.i really don't.
11153,Lynette,too late. i looked--and it's great.
11641,Lynette,"well, scott, i'm not sure i would say, particularly not to someone i just met."
9580,Lynette,i love you.
9091,Lynette,"well, i'm just curious. i mean, he moves out, he moves back in. is he back for good?"
8757,Lynette,"listen, i was just getting dinner ready."
9719,Lynette,i did. i had to load the dishwasher.
11434,Lynette,"i swear, i will be there in one second."
10995,Lynette,"hey, sweetheart, you okay?"
8918,Lynette,"so then you are aware that the wolf is a bad guy. he eats little red's grandma. if you let him go, he's just going to chow down on another defenseless old lady."
11895,Lynette,"see, this is one of the upsides of having cancer. you get to excuse yourself from petty neighborhood squabbles."
8780,Lynette,"if any of you acts up, i will call santa and tell him you want socks for christmas."
9170,Lynette,"okay, mommy's friends are gone now and you can -"
11672,Lynette,that's me. i'll be back.
11075,Lynette,"i have kids, okay? better safe than sorry."
13288,Lynette,please tell me that's not a purple wall clock. pack your bags. we're moving.
8799,Lynette,honey. get a pet. see ya. son of a-?
13210,Lynette,"isn't it exciting, tom? in a few weeks, you are gonna look just like bruce."
12864,Lynette,"well, we've filled the place many times, but it's your party. whatever you want."
9779,Lynette,"hi, i'm back. how's he doing?"
9451,Lynette,hi. hi.
8846,Lynette,why? we unloaded a lot on you.
11790,Lynette,"""top ten new hairstyles"". yeah, well, i'm kinda bald right now, but thanks."
10523,Lynette,"well,honey,in all fairness--those are all things you should be doing anyway."
13173,Lynette,then what's wrong?
8883,Lynette,boys? wake up.
11513,Lynette,"those, too."
11744,Lynette,i'm feeling a little.
12643,Lynette,don't. don't try and justify this. this is sick. you are sick.
12444,Lynette,"yeah. our porter, the kid who communicates with grunts and shrugs, writes this--beautiful, heart-wrenching poetry."
10206,Lynette,really? what's his name?
10948,Lynette,shh! she told us not to talk.
10181,Lynette,why not?
9140,Lynette,that sales girl that sold us the water heater - she had a cute figure.
10413,Lynette,"and--so-- what,you want me to lie?make you look good?"
9759,Lynette,"so on your first day of school, you and your dad can find your cubby and you can hang it up."
10262,Lynette,what?
12921,Lynette,"so? take another one. what's the difference? well, since i'm the only one here who c wait on that table without knocking over a glass with my pants, how about i take it? you handle the cash register. you bus tables. go on."
10008,Lynette,my demands are simple. i want you to be nicer.
8701,Lynette,okay.
9696,Lynette,"um--t-- uh, v--and--uh-- radio--uh, billboards."
12301,Lynette,"do you have a diploma on your wall, tom? i don't think so. zip it."
8893,Lynette,"oh,thanks."
9587,Lynette,"you make me feel like i just got off the shrimp boat, for god's sake."
13089,Lynette,all right.
12916,Lynette,"okay, you fill water glasses. i'll make the salads."
11957,Lynette,"yeah. now he's playing mind games with me, but i laid out some halloween candy. pretty soon he'll get hungry, and when he does--trick or treat."
13036,Lynette,then do something about it. you're the president. put the brakes on lucy.
12601,Lynette,you said you were rehearsing.

11894,Lynette,"uh, you mean katherine 's homeowners thing? yeah, i think i'll sit this one out."
10714,Lynette,"oh, it's once a year. suck it up."
10112,Lynette,you're an attractive man.there is a primal need for a woman to protect what is hers.my initial impulse was justified.
11775,Lynette,out!
10063,Lynette,"you could stand up to fran. if you don't, you'll just become more resentful, she'll get nuttier. and without a father figure, poor mindy will grow up to be a stripper."
9163,Lynette,"oh, actually, she yelled at me for not bringing my garbage cans in."
11511,Lynette,i know. i'm a horrible person. i just chose ravioli over motherhood. i should--i should go home.
11195,Lynette,"and, harry--harry, what did i say?"
10406,Lynette,"wow,that is--really a bummer."
12425,Lynette,"i know. that car is your baby. if only there was something i felt that intensely about. oh, wait! there is-- my actual babies."
13071,Lynette,can you excuse us for one second? i need to go to chemo. i have cancer.
10321,Lynette,"so apparently bree had a few too many and passed out.next thing i know, i get a call at work--someone found my kids wandering the street."
8744,Lynette,"i don't know, but check out the postmark."

11096,Lynette,"wait, wait! art, wait, i'm sorry--i'm sorry."
10414,Lynette,"good.because when i give my deposition,i'm goingto tell the truth."
10627,Lynette,"are we just gonna keep talking louder?is that the plan?you wanna just keep raising your voice 'cause that's how you get what you want, right?you make a scene, you throw a tantrum, and everyone gets scared and backs off.well, i don't work that way, lady.i don't care that my husband was so phenomenally stupid and or drunk to actually have sex with you.i'm not gonna let it ruin my life. am i talking loud enough for that to get through to you?"
10881,Lynette,tom! no.
12844,Lynette,"oh, that man is walter brotski, and he just bought it."
11850,Lynette,"well, it's just like riding a bike. you never forget. now start pedaling. hey. hey. what are you doing?"
8709,Lynette,what are you doing!? we are at a wake!
12929,Lynette,"what? it's a $12,000 oven."
9063,Lynette,i guess he does have a sort of dorky charm.
10572,Lynette,i can't. i can't.i'm sorry. i just can't.
11342,Lynette,"well, after this year, i would be happy with any date that included food and shelter."
12036,Lynette,what are you talking about?
12342,Lynette,so what do i need to do to keep my kids?
12323,Lynette,"all right. thank you. if you're hungry, i'll get you something healthy, and you can have it in the car."
8938,Lynette,"you're not human, are you? you were sent by aliens to make the human race feel inadequate."
9026,Lynette,turn that damn thing off.
11048,Lynette,okay.
8949,Lynette,let's take it outside.
11717,Lynette,"hey, glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest in my life. you didn't care about that, though, did you? you just drove him away."
12003,Lynette,"here's how you can help--don't visit for the next few years, 'cause it seems fairly likely i won't have stopped hating you by then."
11468,Lynette,i don't think so. i'm giving it a try.
12418,Lynette,"come on, tom. i mean, we trust them, right?"
8973,Lynette,"yeah, that's exciting. i wish my sister would visit more often."
12282,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god! what happened? is he okay?"
11263,Lynette,i feel nothing.
10010,Lynette,"yeah. pretty sweet deal, don't you think?"
9729,Lynette,being too lazy to change the sheets is not a principle.
9445,Lynette,"yeah, a lot of good it did her."
11227,Lynette,"hey, guys."
11134,Lynette,"all right, let's hit it. now come on, kayla."
11418,Lynette,what? what? why? why? what happened?
10217,Lynette,"well, honestly,i wasn't blown away."
11221,Lynette,the future of the restaurant is at stake. it is time to get creative.
12807,Lynette,i'll sew anything you want if you just stop getting me pregnant.
11934,Lynette,thanks. why?
8967,Lynette,what did you say?
10109,Lynette,"well,that's not entirely true."
10956,Lynette,"okay, i'm listening."
9167,Lynette,yeah.
9142,Lynette,"nothing. i'm just saying you prefer women that are really curvy, like that sales girl or claire."
11588,Lynette,we're doing inventory.
11114,Lynette,she didn't seem that knocked out by it.
12472,Lynette,"i do, but i'm hoping i'm wrong."
9017,Lynette,sure. whatever.
12202,Lynette,"okay. i know this whole thing with rick-- it really caused us some damage. i know it hurt us, but we survived it, and it's over now."
13283,Lynette,"what, a nanny cam?"
9686,Lynette,"jeez, are you crying?"
11759,Lynette,"so i am halfway through chemo,and my doctor is very confident that i'm going to beat this,so you can all relax.i'm not going to die."
11985,Lynette,give me that.
13238,Lynette,25 years after the first time.
12682,Lynette,"i have to ask you something, and it is very important that you tell me the truth."
9008,Lynette,"you know, you're right."
9085,Lynette,"come on, one, two, three, get in, get in!"
13235,Lynette,what was that? i thought you said the tour was fantastic.
10943,Lynette,"you went after my husband. if anyone should be afraid, it's you."
9368,Lynette,they didn't?
11041,Lynette,sorry?
10812,Lynette,"so if tom was cheating, you wouldn't tell me?"
12906,Lynette,"i thought maybe after our conversation today, you'd realize it's time to pack it in."
8753,Lynette,my babysitter joined the witness relocation program. i haven't slept through the night in 6 years.
9881,Lynette,"well, i don't usually do this."
12814,Lynette,yeah. whoop-dee-doo.
12957,Lynette,hi.
9352,Lynette,he played poker?
13278,Lynette,absolutely.
10606,Lynette,"not here, penny.mommy's gotta change you now 'cause you stink."
10672,Lynette,"shhh, shh, quiet, shush!"
10334,Lynette,"oh. well,you don't have to bribe me.we're all friends here."
11812,Lynette,"yeah, i am taking it. it's just--not working."
12587,Lynette,"ha ha ha, come on in."
11280,Lynette,you pulling rank on me?
10021,Lynette,great.
10821,Lynette,that is not true!
11727,Lynette,"i know it's her wedding night,but do you think we should call gaby?"
12879,Lynette,"we all know how well you're doing, bree. you have made that very clear. but you shouldn't be lording it over everybody just 'cause you've caught a couple of breaks."
10377,Lynette,"really, veronica?well, you know, there's another perk that i just thought of."
8921,Lynette,sure. whatever.
10517,Lynette,"god,your mind goes to dark places."
9287,Lynette,it was a murder.
10209,Lynette,"you have a real job, right here staying home with the kids."
10519,Lynette,"well,fran found out that ed didn't send them,and she blew her top.she wants the responsible party fired,and ed lied and told her--that you sent them."
12018,Lynette,i didn't know you guys had kept in touch.
11509,Lynette,"oh, tom--i'm sorry. i can't come home. we're, um--doing inventory, so--it could be a while."
11223,Lynette,"what?! no.uh-uh.look,i'm wearing makeup.i am holding a briefcase.what does this suggest to you?"
11773,Lynette,i'll see you at home.
12271,Lynette,good.
9585,Lynette,what?
11074,Lynette,"well, i am sorry that happened."
10614,Lynette,i will stop as soon as you promise.
10076,Lynette,we've got day care!
11348,Lynette,"oh, good point. okay, here's another good point: i hate orange."
10385,Lynette,"uh-huh.um,i'm--i'm,um-- i'm gonna have--i'm gonna call you back."
10852,Lynette,i think-- i'm gonna open another bottle of wine.
12125,Lynette,yep. third strike? what were the first two?
11398,Lynette,he kept asking what we do with the food people don't eat.
10648,Lynette,no problem.she's a great little girl.
10416,Lynette,"i'm sorry,mr. bormanis,but i'm not gonna testify.it just doesn't feel right to me."
12158,Lynette,"i'm not presbyterian. i'm a free agent. and if you're open to a little q and a, you've got me."
11808,Lynette,didn't you tell me you lost your virginity in the backseat of a--
11255,Lynette,"um, word on the street is you're looking for a manager."
11553,Lynette,"gaby, she asked me to make twenty pizzas. i couldn't turn it down."
10274,Lynette,"uh,not that i know of. why?"
9802,Lynette,okay.
12372,Lynette,it's--stunning.
10084,Lynette,"oh, sure, but--but maybe next time you could try juggling instead."
13082,Lynette,unless that's a little weird for you.
13017,Lynette,"the problem--how to attract high net worth clients in a down economy. the solution? be creative. christie's is hosting its first ever ""sea auction"" on a yacht in st. barths. i see a boat full of millionaires waiting to be wooed."
10607,Lynette,no way.
10683,Lynette,"ah hun, after the movies.movies than ice cream.an american tradition.so is something wrong?"
12738,Lynette,thank you so much. we are so sorry that we-
9833,Lynette,parker!
9045,Lynette,all your rich friends have nannies. a-list nannies. i need to catch one--here you go--without their bosses.
9230,Lynette,i seriously doubt that.
10178,Lynette,hey.
9164,Lynette,edie!
10788,Lynette,"all right, let's try it again. nice and easy. watch the ball hit the bat. you ready? you can do it. here we go. okay, parker, i keep telling you, you gotta keep your eyes open. how are you gonna hit the ball when you're doing this?"
12756,Lynette,"sweetie, where are you?"
9135,Lynette,"it's a search and rescue, not recovery. we don't know if she's dead."
9873,Lynette,i can handle the extra hours.
8774,Lynette,oh. get in the car.
13120,Lynette,"if tom finds out, he'll freak. he has this weird thing about being the only guy who gets to see me naked."
10105,Lynette,"really?wow, that was nice of you."
12683,Lynette,"did you set that fire at the nightclub? before you answer, let me say that if you did, i promise, your father and i will stand behind you and try and find some way out of this nightmare. but if you lie to me, and i find out later that you--killed--those people--well, i will love you. that will never change, but i won't believe in you anymore, and if i--don't believe in you--i can't help you. we have to tell each other the truth from here on out."
9874,Lynette,yeah.
9144,Lynette,the only reason you made love to me the other night was because you had just seen claire naked.
10646,Lynette,settle down.
10669,Lynette,thank you.
11880,Lynette,"yeah, because i'm bald. and i know that that's a big old turnoff, but, you know, i can't help it."
13050,Lynette,don't forget your little animals!
9046,Lynette,so i can poach me one.
10764,Lynette,nora! you can't be serious!
10801,Lynette,"yeah, guy's a machine. who is that kid?"
13086,Lynette,mm. here's a thought--we all say one word that sums up what we thought of her.
12065,Lynette,"no, toby's an animal, and my husband, a human being, will get very sick if he stays down here, so, please, put the cat upstairs."
10273,Lynette,hi.
13165,Lynette,after?
9826,Lynette,hugs?
11567,Lynette,"oh, hi. uh, change of plans."
9533,Lynette,"well, you can't work with her."
12741,Lynette,"i called you, like, five times."
13078,Lynette,isn't that what she did for the last 15 years?
12091,Lynette,"wow, the things you accumulate in a lifetime, huh?"
11710,Lynette,i'm fine. everything's just fine.
11471,Lynette,you seem a little mopey lately. is everything okay?
9528,Lynette,were you ever going to tell me?
9661,Lynette,"aah! no! no! no, nobody touches mommy, okay? i love you, i love your finger painting, but if you touch me with those messy hands, i will cut them off."
12102,Lynette,at about the rest of these boxes?
11910,Lynette,"hey, a tumor is a tumor whether it's in your body or living across the street."
9208,Lynette,hi.
12932,Lynette,"hey. i got $6,200 for the oven."
12352,Lynette,"i--okay. look, look, i-i will come with you. please, just don't handcuff me in front of my children."
11387,Lynette,"yeah, i know, i know. bottom of the barrel, convicts and losers. you were clear about that last night."
12397,Lynette,sorry.
11194,Lynette,"this place is his dream, and if he can't make it work, then it's just gonna kill him, and consequently it's gonna kill our marriage."
11133,Lynette,yeah. i should treat her as badly as i treat my own children.
9917,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey, porter, preston, knock it off. all right, did you hear me, i said stop it. stand up. stand up! come here!"
11166,Lynette,"oh. yeah, that's right."
12584,Lynette,"well--it's a little dumb, but compared to what i was thinking--"
13267,Lynette,"so it is the cancer. oh, god, i can't go through this again!"
9690,Lynette,"stu. you look like a bright, uh, responsible young man, and i bet you just love kids. am i right?"
10531,Lynette,here are the numbers you wanted.
11376,Lynette,"listen to me. i forbid you to die. if you leave me with a mortgage and a restaurant and five kids, i swear i will track you into the deepest pit of hell and make you pay. do you hear me? come on, baby--oh, please."
12474,Lynette,"""gigs""? did you just say ""gigs""?"
9192,Lynette,no! you're not dying! people just think that because i shaved your head.
10558,Lynette,i got my boarding pass.
10198,Lynette,"yeah, and ed said we can finally afford to hire another executive."
10240,Lynette,"on one condition.if you take this job,you are never allowed to bring up what happened before with your promotion."
13160,Lynette,"tom, i have a 7:00 a.m. meeting. how about i take a long lunch, and you do me twice at work tomorrow?"
12949,Lynette,"bye-bye, high road."
10810,Lynette,"oh, my god! yes!"
10411,Lynette,"all right.that's-- not why you came to apologize,is it?"
9988,Lynette,why? are you worried they might get in?
9102,Lynette,oh. well. good luck with that.
10047,Lynette,"well, she won't just take some time off for a couple of hours?"
8720,Lynette,"natalie klein, i don't believe it!"
12534,Lynette,"do a cross-promotion with some of the major food companies. knock off 20% on some of the items featured in your recipes, then they do the same towards the purchase of your cookbook."
11515,Lynette,okay. back to edie--i'm not sure i'm comfortable ganging up on her.
12666,Lynette,"tom, i was 6 feet away. porter looked warren schilling in the eye and said, ""you're dead. i don't care what it takes. you're dead."""
12038,Lynette,are you kidding? it would've changed everything.
9151,Lynette,"he doesn't have a cough yet, but he sort of has this post-nasal drip thing happening."
10631,Lynette,"if she takes you to court, we'll lose and end up paying 11 years of child support all at once. we could lose the house."
11833,Lynette,"yeah, no, i'm good. hey, do you think they have any grapes or lobster?"
9276,Lynette,no. i'll just wait out here.
11182,Lynette,my husband is in trouble. i love him. shouldn't i want to help him?
10535,Lynette,"no! i'm sorry,tom gets punished beuse you can't deal with your screwed-up marriage.it is pathetic,ed.if you had stood up to your wife in the first place,none of this--what?"
10928,Lynette,"whoa! whoa, whoa! you have stepped onto my property, and you've talked to tom. that's two rules you've broken, and i'm not sure that top doesn't make three."
8852,Lynette,"boys, will you come in here please?"
12256,Lynette,"no, the twins did, but they say it was your idea."
12951,Lynette,what are you doing?
10827,Lynette,please? you can't bend the rules just once?
9037,Lynette,sunscreen?
8983,Lynette,"hey, word on the street is that you've been medicating timmy--"
10698,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey! please!"
13140,Lynette,"no, we're in our third week. we got this down to a science. just deal me out a few hands."
11193,Lynette,"and whoa, whoa, whoa, harry. eyes up here."
12357,Lynette,kayla--i'm sorry how everything turned out.
10981,Lynette,hey.
12203,Lynette,"oh, tom."
13219,Lynette,"this isn't about me, tom. come on."
9572,Lynette,it's just-
9019,Lynette,go to hell. go to hell. go to hell. go to hell. go to hell.
10889,Lynette,"it means childish, stubborn, careless with my money and your futures."
11378,Lynette,how much of a while?
10973,Lynette,"hello. oh, this side. hi!"
12806,Lynette,"it's not happening, tom."
10600,Lynette,why did she wait so long to contact you?
12759,Lynette,"there is not a shred of evidence against you. when people see that, they will be on your side just like we are. sweetie, you have to trust me."
9555,Lynette,good.
11949,Lynette,"huh? oh, the pet scan. no, not till tomorrow. listen, i need your help. there's a possum in my garden."
11801,Lynette,"gaby, this was a wonderful idea. i cannot tell you how much it means to me."
11547,Lynette,no! go ride the python! come on.
9767,Lynette,you know how the first hour of the morning meeting is always so slow? 'cause i've got this thing--
9806,Lynette,i'm looking for parker's umbrella. have you seen it?
10193,Lynette,that's actually good.
10024,Lynette,word got out that you and nina were-
13304,Lynette,"oh, yeah!"
11494,Lynette,"i don't know how she does it. hey, it's getting late. let's break out the champagne."
9670,Lynette,hi. what are you doing out here?
12617,Lynette,i think-- i have to sit down now.
12288,Lynette,i think we have a seriously troubled young girl.
10785,Lynette,what?
12637,Lynette,you're having sex with your best friend's mother?
10521,Lynette,"look,i know it's ridiculous,but ed is not a rational person.fran has him whipped,and a whipped husband is someone we must take very seriously."
11529,Lynette,"wow, that many?"
9457,Lynette,what do you mean porter had less fun? i'll raise.
12690,Lynette,"look, this family has been through a lot lately, and your dad and i feel we'll be better parents if we know what's going on in your lives. so, parker, how's that science project you've been working on?"
11632,Lynette,"you wanna know what's bugging me? i'm trying to have a lovely breakfast with my family, and you're picking a fight."
10490,Lynette,"i mean, you and fran could spice it up a bit.you know, get the old juices flowing again."
9787,Lynette,"and that's why we packed you extra cookies so you could share with all your new friends, remember?"
8804,Lynette,"throw a dinner party? i don't even have time to wash my face. no, you know what? i'm gonna go to this one. you can stay home and babysit the kids."
8723,Lynette,"yeah, well."
11661,Lynette,you had lunch with rick.
11800,Lynette,it's okay. come here. let it go.
11548,Lynette,"okay, okay, she's circling the park."
12198,Lynette,"thank you. oh, oh, hey, honey. could you hold back a sec?"
12006,Lynette,"yes, hi. i'm looking for my mom. she hangs out at your bar sometimes. stella wingfield? uh, older lady, big smoker, talks like a teamster. well, that's your fault for letting her run a tab. look, if you see her, could you tell her to call lynette? thank you."
9772,Lynette,this system is gonna let mommy be with you on your first day of school. the resolution is fantastic.
8769,Lynette,"oh! excuse me, i'm sorry, i'm looking for my boys. three boys with red hair, have you seen 'em?"
9175,Lynette,"and it's frustrating for me too, 'cause i do want to be the best mommy i can be."
10369,Lynette,"but,honey, it goes back and forth."
13264,Lynette,do you know what they are?
12302,Lynette,"of course i do--as much as i can, given the way she joined our family. it's just--it's complicated."
10557,Lynette,sorry. stop. done talking.that's fantastic.i love you!
12885,Lynette,"i know you don't, but five years ago, you would've."
10831,Lynette,good.
11420,Lynette,"look, i'll talk to tom--"
12554,Lynette,hi. my husband--i'm lynette scavo. dr. baron called me--
10268,Lynette,"i am not fighting your fights.this is my fight.this is how guys do business, right?"
10228,Lynette,"yeah, gosh, it is.it's quite impressive.oh, wow,i see you worked for bellfore and barrasso.that's a great shop."
12082,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god! tom! help me! help me, tom!"
11779,Lynette,"yeah, so far--not that bad. though i did have to kick tom out yesterday."
12945,Lynette,thank you. this will really cheer tom up.
11555,Lynette,gaby!
10717,Lynette,"so, he was an actual suspect?"
13273,Lynette,"well, apparently, not old enough."
11137,Lynette,"kayla, i'm not fooling around. we--we're going."
11924,Lynette,have i got your vote?
13223,Lynette,"tom, why didn't you help me out there?"
9515,Lynette,"you're a piece of work, you know that? well, this is crazy, why'd they give you childproof caps?"
12016,Lynette,"oh, just a little cancer. no, but i kicked its ass. i'm good now. you come here. oh! so why--why are you here?"
11331,Lynette,"i told you what i want. hot bath, bed early, but you chose not to listen."
10779,Lynette,you're a bright guy.isn't there anything else you might wanna do?
10499,Lynette,"ugh.""i love the way that blouse clings to your body."""
10189,Lynette,thank you.
9662,Lynette,go on. off. good.
12887,Lynette,a check for the damage to your car. i can't afford to go through my insurance company.
11819,Lynette,12. and that's my point. i'm undefeated. why spoil my winning streak by playing when i'm not up to it?
11294,Lynette,come on. we need you at your best tonight.
10285,Lynette,hi.is now a bad time?i could really use a favor.
9436,Lynette,are you sure you want to be saying these things in front of your daughter?
9683,Lynette,"don't do this to me. i don't have time to make a phone call, and i promised that woman i would not let the kids interfere with this job."
12586,Lynette,hi. what's that for?
8903,Lynette,i know you did not just say that.
11750,Lynette,"and,edie,you look great. especially,you know,given the circumstances."
8996,Lynette,"no, they don't."
11232,Lynette,yeah! don't be silly. i'm fine. come on. let's go sell some toothpaste.
12737,Lynette,"but if the judge finds out that porter's gone, we have to forfeit the bail."
11861,Lynette,it was itchy.
11667,Lynette,"well, i feel just fine now."
9054,Lynette,couldn't you have just said no?
12875,Lynette,you want to explain this?
11977,Lynette,wait a minute. that was all the money you had?
11124,Lynette,eat your tacos.
11822,Lynette,this really is delicious.
10412,Lynette,to soften me up for the deposition.
9317,Lynette,"well, it's great, obviously. thank you."
12914,Lynette,"sweetie, i need two dinner salads. what's the matter?"
10420,Lynette,how can you be so sure?we have andrew saying that it's systematic physical abuse.and then we have bree saying it's andrew wanting to be emancipated so he can get at his trust fund so he can buy a car.how are we supposed to know the real truth?
9550,Lynette,i'm good. looks like we're got some company.
11649,Lynette,"look, even if gaby is in the wrong here--and she--she is hugely, hideously wrong--do you really want to boycott her wedding?"
12572,Lynette,"just so i'm clear, you want us to sell our thriving business so we can live in a bus, like carnies?"
9868,Lynette,hi.
11003,Lynette,"no, i won't. lots of mommies go to the store every day, and they're fine. it's really not a scary place."
12022,Lynette,"once she shows up, you'll meet her and give her the money. then ask her to walk you back to the car. i'll jump out, grab her, and while you open the trunk--"
10965,Lynette,"no, you're not. i can tell. please-- tell me what's wrong. let me save you."
10789,Lynette,"if i threw any slower, we would be bowling."
10073,Lynette,"no, and you're gonna get her back a whole lot faster if you will just listen to me. okay? listen, and you? all right, good. so, first of all, ed, stealing the baby was really stupid."
12366,Lynette,"fine. you can be as angry and sulky and pissy as you want, just so long as you're here tomorrow, helping me crank out 250 mini pizzas."
8865,Lynette,i really do appreciate you guys staying and helping.
12054,Lynette,we can be quiet--relative to the storm.
12680,Lynette,who's that?
12597,Lynette,"tom, where are you?"
12328,Lynette,okay.
13037,Lynette,"but she makes people crazy. can't you talk to her, get her to dial it down a bit?"
9381,Lynette,"no, not -- not -- not quite yet. boys, keep bouncing. that's right. keep bouncing. oh, by the way, i spoke to nurse abigail. i know who patient zero is."
11971,Lynette,"well, it got me thinking about how much you've had to put your life on hold these past few months."
11865,Lynette,tom? the kids are asleep. are you coming to bed anytime soon?
12365,Lynette,"'cause you know we didn't have a choice, tom. we had to get her out of the house."
10434,Lynette,i was helping bree with her recycling.
10470,Lynette,"well,that doesn't matter!you gotta quit talking to people about their bodies,and about where,you know,babies come from."
9756,Lynette,"parker, guess what i got."
8941,Lynette,"that's add medication. my kids take this, or they almost did. i thought it was supposed to calm you down."
9744,Lynette,"hey, sweet pea. why? what's wrong?"
9413,Lynette,are you saying i'm not tactful?
10568,Lynette,uh-- no.
9489,Lynette,you're not going to die.
12798,Lynette,oh. that's what it means.
11155,Lynette,ooh!
11745,Lynette,"oh,i'm gonna be sick!"
10609,Lynette,eight hours of grueling labor.
8707,Lynette,"ow! ease up, you little vampire."
11986,Lynette,she's so not like that now.
11929,Lynette,what? you think you can just walk over here and cute your way out of what you did? we're supposed to be friends.
11156,Lynette,so-- any idea when that might be?
11742,Lynette,"it's my life.some stupid disease is not gonna keep me from living it.besides,parker's expecting to see me."
10832,Lynette,no.
12459,Lynette,uh-- thanks.
12880,Lynette,"i've worked my ass off, too. i just wasn't as lucky as you."
13049,Lynette,i don't know. i'm just as worried as you are.
11738,Lynette,yeah. things have been a little weird lately--
9876,Lynette,yeah?
12775,Lynette,where is he?
12687,Lynette,"no. sweetie, i don't."
11201,Lynette,good for him.
8902,Lynette,we're not moving.
12766,Lynette,porter?
10498,Lynette,"for god's sakes,it's not brain surgery.is she still online?"
13262,Lynette,"okay, that's everyone."
8751,Lynette,you saying i'm a bad mother?
8928,Lynette,"it's science, gabrielle.sociologists have documented this stuff."
11594,Lynette,"oh-- my--god! oh! oh, my god! they locked us in here! it's forty-two degrees! we're gonna freeze to death!"
8895,Lynette,"listen, i'm sorry about mike. i know how much you like him."
9362,Lynette,nurse abigail?
9829,Lynette,shut up.
11315,Lynette,"yes, you did. but i have customers."
10041,Lynette,"yeah, like you haven't been through enough."
11394,Lynette,hi.
9621,Lynette,"yeah, that didn't walk into mike's garage by itself."
11720,Lynette,stop comparing us. i never did what you did.
9749,Lynette,"it was good, but, more importantly, how was yours?"
10301,Lynette,"okay,all right,that lie just lost you another week of tv and video game privileges.that's two.you wanna keep talking and lose more?then apologize to mrs. van de kamp."
10645,Lynette,"yeah, that would be a shame."
11660,Lynette,sorry. i'll try to be gentler as i move down south.
9845,Lynette,"because of me, my son's imaginary friend got crushed by a garbage truck. i am the worst person in the world."
11051,Lynette,watch her. i'll be back. i'll be right back.
12430,Lynette,got a sec?
9970,Lynette,where's penny?
10352,Lynette,"are you serious?tom,i wasn't doing anything.i was just going for it.i was just lost in the moment.oh,come on!come on,this is silly.i don't wanna argue.i mean,unless it turns you on.does it? 'cause theni'm all about it,baby."
12909,Lynette,okay. fine.
13098,Lynette,"sweetie, i'm home. hey."
12005,Lynette,"hey, glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest of my life. you drove him away."
12336,Lynette,abuse? that's ridiculous.
9801,Lynette,"what? oh, um. well, since i'm here, maybe she could just relax in the house for a little while, okay?"
9375,Lynette,"for god's sakes, there's gonna be a magician. tammy brennan went all out."
10561,Lynette,and what if i see him with another woman? what then?
11014,Lynette,"in the daytime, art coaches swimming at the rec center, but, please, i can tell parker? please?"
9161,Lynette,"yeah, okay. that's what i like to hear."
13303,Lynette,"hell, yeah.first, i want you to touch yourself."
9131,Lynette,want some coffee?
11141,Lynette,"guys, how would you like to eat dinner in front of the television for a whole week?"
11066,Lynette,"i know! if something happened to someone's kid because i kept my mouth shut--the thing is, i promised tom i'd back off."
11180,Lynette,but i'm his wife.
13020,Lynette,"yeah. yeah, that gaby's a real class act."
11264,Lynette,i told you i wanted this floor to sparkle like your mom's.now does this floor look bree hodge clean to you?
9012,Lynette,i'm sorry. you were saying something about wind?
11167,Lynette,okay. good. i'll see ya.
12253,Lynette,kayla? can i speak to you for a second?
8958,Lynette,that's the mystery part.
11627,Lynette,"i missed you, too."
12558,Lynette,so he's okay?
10932,Lynette,"see?this is exactly what she wants.she takes kayla,and i get blamed.well,screw her.let's sue for custody."
9761,Lynette,"yeah, well, honey, i have to work. mommy's boss is a mean, mean lady and if i miss work, i'll lose my job and then we won't have any money to buy food. honey, you gotta believe me, if i could be there, you know that i would."
12783,Lynette,no. no. it means she outsmarted her mom.
13110,Lynette,then maybe i'd get that raise i've been asking for.
12058,Lynette,yeah. mm.
9872,Lynette,nina.
10929,Lynette,you're the lunatic if you think i'm letting you anywhere near my husband.just drop kayla off and go.
11055,Lynette,parker!
12980,Lynette,"i do, and it's okay. besides, did you hear what came out of my mouth? like i said--wow."
8939,Lynette,"seriously, how, how do you cram it all in?"
11403,Lynette,no. it's great you can spell. you are now officially the front-runner.
11186,Lynette,thank you.
10124,Lynette,"well, 99% wrong."
12873,Lynette,"hey, can i borrow you a sec?"
13028,Lynette,gaby!
8742,Lynette,let's get this show on the road.
12283,Lynette,get up. up.
11487,Lynette,"i just heard on the radio the power company is still having problems, and there might be another rolling blackout today. do you want me to leave ida's number in case something happens?"
12611,Lynette,liar.
11559,Lynette,you put him in the freezer and kept cashing the checks.
9931,Lynette,"oh, uh--"
10800,Lynette,"hey, hey, that is not helpful. it only takes one, parker! only takes one!"
12237,Lynette,"okay, you are angry, so i'm gonna let that one pass, and i'm gonna say this for e very last time. nothing happened between me and rick."
12836,Lynette,but it's 85 degrees outside. i've never done this before.
11655,Lynette,"remember when i was giving birth to the twins and screaming in agony because porter was dragging my uterus out with him? well, i was more in the mood for sex then than i am now."
10244,Lynette,"yeah, something about the applewhites.i'm dying of curiosity."
9401,Lynette,she is so opening that letter.
11888,Lynette,"oh, i'd like that."
9639,Lynette,"tom, what are you doing?"
11557,Lynette,i might take a little for tom and--
9538,Lynette,you heard me.
12526,Lynette,oh!
9264,Lynette,"no, don't you dare. we'll move it when you say please."
12270,Lynette,"actually, you do. that's why you're here. so let's just wait and talk to the doctor, okay?"
9633,Lynette,"yeah, and he's so young, he's gonna bounce right back."
10660,Lynette,she said coyly.
11287,Lynette,"hey, what are you doing?"
12901,Lynette,i know.
12961,Lynette,that sounds--amazing.
9074,Lynette,how fast can you pack?
9121,Lynette,okay.
10739,Lynette,could you be all about shutting up!
11835,Lynette,"oh, my god. ""hang 'em high"" has three syllables."
11628,Lynette,you can't work here anymore.
12150,Lynette,what isn't my fault?
9117,Lynette,she's bringing him home from the hospital today.
9827,Lynette,that'll fix everything? hugs?
11816,Lynette,"well, thanks, but prefer not to get my medication from some guy under a bridge."
11112,Lynette,"porter! i--you know what? i got you something, too."
12123,Lynette,then why don't i feel better?
12424,Lynette,yeah. remember when you spent the entire day on the internet trying to find a new gearshift knob? worst anniversary ever.
9914,Lynette,"sometimes we just need to get something that makes us happy. i know that sounds selfish, but i've been thinking. it might make us better people and maybe even better parents."
13141,Lynette,"hey, honey. how's your day going?"
12549,Lynette,penny!
8829,Lynette,"well, the little girl."
11437,Lynette,"look, i think you're great, and we would be lucky to have you. it's just, my husband isn't really comfortable--"
9309,Lynette,"look, wait, wait. i know what this means to you."
10502,Lynette,what?
11416,Lynette,i'm sorry.
10823,Lynette,"no.it was excitement, because we have just decided you don't have to play baseball anymore. ha! isn't that great?"
8815,Lynette,oh. didn't have a good time?
10865,Lynette,"i don't know if you noticed,but when you first pitched the whole pizza concept--i was a wee bit skeptical."
10425,Lynette,she must be.it's hard for me to imagine the bree i know capable of hurting you.
10503,Lynette,hey there.did you have a late night?i hope.
8696,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey, hey!"
11310,Lynette,did you get some sleep?
10031,Lynette,yeah.
9011,Lynette,"parker! i don't know --ow!--what you think that you're doing, but put that back where it belongs!"
12293,Lynette,"i understand. it just seems like--at $140 an hour, we could skip straight to the part where you sit down with kayla and tell her to stop being so evil."
11282,Lynette,okay.
11918,Lynette,what? that doesn't even make sense.
13200,Lynette,you're not doing this. we can't afford it!
12817,Lynette,"jeffrey cuevas is retiring in september. i am the perfect person to step into his job, and that is exactly when parker starts kindergarten. the timing is like a dream."
11451,Lynette,"oh, i don't wanna scare them away."
8811,Lynette,i think i can top that. try getting thrown out of disneyland for lewd behaviour.
12450,Lynette,oh. sorry. enjoy!
12501,Lynette,"oh, god, no. her agency really whiffed-- hmm? so i'm coming up with a whole new campaign. i was looking through my old portfolio for inspiration."
9766,Lynette,"uh, about tomorrow morning--"
12055,Lynette,that's in the middle of skid row. you think i want my kids around a bunch of winos?
8728,Lynette,i wasn't expecting you for a week!
12279,Lynette,you're burying your head in the sand.
12184,Lynette,"so where were you? you were stewing, weren't you? come on. you're upset about rick."
9291,Lynette,"well, did you tell mr. peterson that you wanted the job?"
11030,Lynette,the door was open--i was bringing him a cake.
9406,Lynette,it was really nasty and he wouldn't shut up either.
9614,Lynette,huh. speak of the devil. and i mean that.
11273,Lynette,"look, i don't know what kind of hustle you pulled on him, but it's not gonna work on me."
11284,Lynette,whatever you say--boss.
9842,Lynette,oh.
9592,Lynette,"no, i'm glad that you find my humiliation so entertaining."
11753,Lynette,i don't want to hear it.
12438,Lynette,"and, uh--how would somebody make that happen?"
10375,Lynette,"fair enough, fair enough.okay, what is your secret?how can you eat like that and keep your figure?"
12557,Lynette,oh. is he--
11570,Lynette,"hey, mrs. mccluskey."
12384,Lynette,why is there a police car in our driveway?
11510,Lynette,i will. i love you. bye.
10036,Lynette,"oh, god, ed. i am so sorry."
10744,Lynette,so?
12496,Lynette,hey. congratulations!
13070,Lynette,"no, i can't. uh, see? cancer."
11768,Lynette,"hey, i told you i'm collecting queens."
9271,Lynette,"if our house catches fire i guarantee you, she's the one that started it."
12564,Lynette,what the hell is this?
12462,Lynette,"you said it was great. way to bury the lead, tom! tom, don't you dare!"
9706,Lynette,"okay, obviously, i'm gonna clean that up."
10571,Lynette,hello?
9531,Lynette,do you still have feelings for her?
10350,Lynette,what?
13119,Lynette,"oh, well, i appreciate that. and here's something else i'd appreciate--could we not tell anyone else about this?"
9998,Lynette,"all right. this is my last hand, then i gotta go."
13204,Lynette,really? poor bruce.
9996,Lynette,"guys, we talked about this. what happened to standing up for ourselves?"
9961,Lynette,"you do that. okay, guys, come on over here. on the sidewalk. stay there. not on the street. thank you."
10941,Lynette,"ah, i see you've heard from our lawyer."
12451,Lynette,"oh, crap on things."
12094,Lynette,"yeah, right. oh, you're serious?"
13244,Lynette,"please, sensei, instruct me in your ancient ways."
11038,Lynette,"hey, what's up?"
10534,Lynette,"if this is where you want me to apologize for my husband,i'm not gonna do it.maybe he shouldn't have hit you,but you provoked him."
11684,Lynette,"anyway, i know i said that we would come and visit you this june, but i'll be a little woozy and--bald from the chemo, so--thanks for understanding. oh, one more thing--our insurance policy has a really high deductible, so we are strapped financially, and i was wondering if maybe you and dave might be able to--oh, really? no, i am not asking mom. she doesn't know about any of this, so don't you tell her, okay? we'll be fine. i love you. bye."
11846,Lynette,"we, it's amazing what a week without chemo can do."
11136,Lynette,"well, they, you know, wolfed it down like kids are supposed to. so-- hurry it up."
10989,Lynette,he said take as much time as i want with pay.
9907,Lynette,"good morning. hi. i'm lynette scavo. now is everyone taken care of in terms of coffee and whatever else they may like? great. well, then, let's get started. i will show you how kamarov vodka can expand its customer mindshare while still holding the line on marketing costs. it's something we here at percher and murphy like to call ""persuasive engineering."""
9204,Lynette,"uh, yeah, sure, knock yourself out! be careful."
11590,Lynette,thank god for italian. you can charge way more for 'orecchiette with pancetta' than you'd ever get for 'bacon and little ears.'
9839,Lynette,you're so sweet. come here. i love you. you all right? go get dressed.
10410,Lynette,"i,i'll focus on your good qualities."
11604,Lynette,"i'm sorry. i would've called, but they took our cell phones before they locked us in there."
12225,Lynette,so when are you guys gonna finish grilling my husband?
12977,Lynette,"yes. tom was very good at his job, right up until he got fired."
9501,Lynette,"oh, for god's sake."
11406,Lynette,"well, i should probably take a look at your application first. okay, don't be afraid if you don't have a ton of experience. i realize for what we're paying, we're not exactly gonna get a--you were a sous-chef at cucina? that's a five-star restaurant."
10617,Lynette,thank you.
9935,Lynette,"actually, yes. we've agonized whether to tell you this, norma, but one of your private videos made its way into jimmy and pj's bag."
9408,Lynette,"yeah, that's great. what am i gonna do?"
9354,Lynette,"um, i'm not sure."
11117,Lynette,"oh, sorry, sweetheart. he's working late, trying to get the restaurant ready. oh, lovely, parker. go wash your hands. go on."
12664,Lynette,absolutely.
10215,Lynette,"oh, hey! hey!"
12937,Lynette,sorry.
9363,Lynette,i just wanted to tell you that the boys are now lice-free.
9649,Lynette,"yes, i am sorry. i am so, so sorry. i didn't want to hurt you. but i was trying to protect our family. if you got a promotion, we never would have seen you. you would have been traveling all the -"
11619,Lynette,"oh, jeez. what choice do i have?"
11923,Lynette,"you can keep that satellite dish. in fact, this is practically a first amendment issue. the way i see it--"
10460,Lynette,"hey,mrs. mccluskey.so how did everything go?"
10559,Lynette,"is this crazy?following tom across the country just to spy on him?if he knewi was doing this--god, i don't think i can go through with this."
12748,Lynette,"what? what?! that's why he ran away? i thought he was afraid of going to jail. well, i'm sure warren schilling was just trying to scare him."
12138,Lynette,"okay. well, i'll be right back. oh, this is so exciting. i'm going to church. by the way, what am i now?"
10345,Lynette,"so,boys,how do you enjoy the meat loaf?"
10275,Lynette,really?
10195,Lynette,"hey,i got great news!we just landed the black's frozen yogurt account!"
10149,Lynette,chicken pox?that's the emergency?
12720,Lynette,"well, is it okay if i go up and get it?"
9735,Lynette,hi. hi.
11296,Lynette,"well, i'm so glad she has you to take care of her, and of course your mom comes first, andrew. and i wouldn't even ask except, you know, we're opening tonight--"
10991,Lynette,shot? where did you hear that?
13203,Lynette,and? how's he look?
12187,Lynette,"yeah, it's back."
10183,Lynette,staying home and taking care of the kids doesn't make you less of a man.that's crazy.
11599,Lynette,no. that's just me. tom's always kicking the covers off the bed. he calls me his little blonde furnace.
11295,Lynette,"tom, i do not need to be pregnant to kick your ass. now go. go on."
11830,Lynette,movie. it's a western.
9753,Lynette,you killed it?
11983,Lynette,nobody is manipulating you.
9737,Lynette,"i saw you walk in, and i've been meaning to call since the service, but work's been so crazy so--how are you doing?"
11576,Lynette,yeah.
9416,Lynette,that's telling him.
9066,Lynette,hey.
9364,Lynette,"i just can't figure out how it happened. they get a bath every night. trust me, it's the ugliest 15 minutes of the day."
10771,Lynette,"and you think that's easy? okay, i have a good life. yes, yes, i am very lucky, but i work twelve hours a day, and then i come home to what seems like thirty three children, and husband who refuses to get a job. and believe me, there is not a supermom out there who wouldn't trade in her cape, for a chance to read a book and get a massage by a man who has the decency to leave when it's over."
10675,Lynette,"no, i think she'll be over here in ten minutes."
10450,Lynette,"no,not exactly.i'm just--i'm trying to understand why you--did that."
9609,Lynette,no. nononono.
9858,Lynette,"no, it's fine, i'll pick it up on my way home. so, what do you want?"
9622,Lynette,yeah.
11360,Lynette,"because i need to win one, tom."
11028,Lynette,"what are you, his lawyer? you have to admit, it's odd."
9067,Lynette,--i took--
9481,Lynette,"you want to talk about good neighbour etiquette, how about you hire a gardener to take care of that jungle you call a lawn."
8840,Lynette,i used to run a company with 85 people and now i can't wrangle three small boys without doping them. talk about feeling like a failure.
12605,Lynette,"good. maybe when you come home, you could teach me how to play that video game."
9028,Lynette,"no, no, i'm sorry, i can't do this. it's just too much. boys, you stay with your aunt susan."
9053,Lynette,so your boss made you return her underwear?
9289,Lynette,"oh, tom, i'm so sorry."
8963,Lynette,yeah?
8849,Lynette,"of course, of course."
9830,Lynette,"hey, buddy. you busy?"
9713,Lynette,two days.
12950,Lynette,"that's how i got rid of tom's last bottle of ""musk, the cologne for men."""
9736,Lynette,i'm sorry. am i interrupting?
11857,Lynette,"yeah, and showers aren't just about presents. they're fun."
10440,Lynette,what is it?
11269,Lynette,get your stuff. get the hell out of my restaurant. you're fired. go on.
12505,Lynette,"as you can see, the graphic works just as well on a free-standing display unit. neat, huh?"
11798,Lynette,"oh, my god."
10415,Lynette,i don't know why i have to get dragged into this.what happened with my kids has nothing to do with bree's situation with andrew.sit.
12870,Lynette,"bree, no one will notice. parmesan is the fourth cheese in a four cheese pizza. it's the ringo of these cheeses."
12628,Lynette,i am not promising anything.
11177,Lynette,this is a nightmare. how did this happen?
13034,Lynette,"um, i have a tiny scheduling conflict. i coach my daughter's basketball team on friday nights. so if i could--"
9985,Lynette,i'm just trying to prove a point.
8919,Lynette,i'm lynette scavo. my twins just joined. they're playing oak trees.
9393,Lynette,my twins talk about matt all the time. we should set up a play date.
9313,Lynette,"oh, you know it."
11939,Lynette,"you saw a possum, and you didn't tell me?"
9090,Lynette,"so, how are things with you and rex?"
10127,Lynette,"you know what the 1% is, right?"
12314,Lynette,mnh-mnh.
11552,Lynette,"well, edie hired me to cater, so it's just business. i don't know what her excuse is."
12881,Lynette,meaning that i've created my own failure?
11464,Lynette,but?
9894,Lynette,"you see? you see how it, how it moves with me? that's where the magic is."
13154,Lynette,"sorry. just had the handyman in here, but he's finished. thank you, handyman."
12871,Lynette,"oh, for pete sake. i'll be right back."
12337,Lynette,"okay--first, i'm not that kind of mom. and second, kayla has a tendency to--exaggerate."
9146,Lynette,"oh, so you are attracted to her."
10222,Lynette,"you want the truth, tom?i think you're good.you have moments of brilliance.but i also think sometimes you coast.and i think if i were your boss and had to ride your ass every day,you would come home seething with resentment.come on! it's hard enough keeping a marriage together."
9530,Lynette,tom!
9120,Lynette,"well, i'm just trying to plan my day."
10960,Lynette,"no, i will not shut up! what's the matter with you?!"
11503,Lynette,we're trying so hard to protect them from this. there are just some things that kids don't need to know about.
11928,Lynette,don't do that. i wanna be sad when they knock it down.
11536,Lynette,i agree.
11033,Lynette,i'm not snapping at you.
11984,Lynette,what have you got there? are you reading from something?
13104,Lynette,"ooh. whining-- that's hot. fine. let's have sex. but i warn you, i'm just gonna lie here, resenting you the whole time, waiting for this hell to be over."
9321,Lynette,really?
8864,Lynette,"go!go, go!"
8826,Lynette,let 'em look. as long as they don't try and cut in.
11354,Lynette,"no. no, don't be silly. who am i, tom? i'm one of you guys. sit down. hey--you know what we could use? a good old-fashioned bi*ch session, get some stuff off our chests. so what's bugging you guys? okay, i'll go first. how do we feel about these uniforms? a little--eh?"
9191,Lynette,sure.
8838,Lynette,fine.
12660,Lynette,thank you.
10500,Lynette,"mnh-mnh-mnh.""yeah? what did you want to do to me?"""
9285,Lynette,"well, i wouldn't put it past them."
12340,Lynette,wait. they could take my children?
12296,Lynette,she never does this.
9379,Lynette,"yeah, sure, boys. have fun."
11729,Lynette,hey! hey! my wig is gone.where is it?
10938,Lynette,"oh, yeah, i heard she isn't well. can i ask what's wrong with her?"
11997,Lynette,"well, we can't just throw her out on the street."
10049,Lynette,"oh, well, come on in my office."
11979,Lynette,"oh, you know her, always busy."
9692,Lynette,thanks so much for having me in.
9838,Lynette,"i mean this is conjecture on my part, but it is possible that someone like little spencer needs mrs. mulberry more 'cause he doesn't have a daddy and a mommy who love him. yeah, that's it. he's an orphan with no hands. okay?"
10551,Lynette,"tom, it would be better for your general well-being if you did not laugh at this moment in time."
11671,Lynette,don't do this.
13250,Lynette,"okay, whoa, whoa, easy. you're a little drunk there."
9763,Lynette,"well, hey, when a kid's that good, you gotta give him his due."
11037,Lynette,hold on.
9441,Lynette,"yes, thank you. i know what she just said."
9069,Lynette,just give me a second.
9846,Lynette,you really think so? really?
12561,Lynette,"the kids know everything's fine. they send their love. don't worry about anything, okay? just rest. i'll come back soon, okay?"
9338,Lynette,"measles, huh?"
8760,Lynette,"i try everything. i scream, i threaten, i reason, i beg, nothing works. i don't know if it's because they're too young and they don't understand, or if they're just getting some perverse joy out of testing me!"
12229,Lynette,and tom was at the founder's ball with me.
12851,Lynette,"no. thank you, but i can't accept this. however, i would like to know how much i'm not accepting. $20,000? how many cookbooks are you selling, woman?"
9702,Lynette,"well, then watch me multitask."
13148,Lynette,"but i have so much to do, and i'm not gonna be done till 2:00 a.m. possibly 3:00. whoo!"
9323,Lynette,"yeah, of course."
9520,Lynette,i'll see you tomorrow morning.
9916,Lynette,"guys, stop it! stop it, i mean it, come on!"
10654,Lynette,"no, i am sorry.how much of her crap do i have to put up with?first it's little drop bys, than she's inviting herself to dinner three times a week.now she wants to be in our christmas photo? i'm sorry, no, that is not happening."
9034,Lynette,i'm so tired of feeling like a failure.
9024,Lynette,"no, tom, you can't do this to me. because, i need you at home. boys, stop it, i am on the phone. well, yeah, i realize it's not your fault that the meeting got postponed, but you promised you'd be back tonight. i, i, i gotta go. the kids are-- yeah, i know-- you're sorry, just, will you try to get back as soon as you can? okay, bye."
9407,Lynette,i can't believe you said we'd play tennis with them.
12480,Lynette,"ooh! careful, honey."
12281,Lynette,come on. i do.
12837,Lynette,"yeah, i do."
12986,Lynette,"coming. do me a favor. if you hear a gunshot, tell my four kids i love them."
10543,Lynette,you know what's weird?
11930,Lynette,you're right. i shouldn't have done that. but that tree house is the one place my kids can go and not hear about body scans and white blood cell counts. it is their getaway from this horrible thing that i've brought into the house.
9065,Lynette,"oh, she never showed up, somebody's got to take her place."
12800,Lynette,"well, we watch the kids play soccer."
11571,Lynette,"well, it turns out our new babysitter isn't working out too well. feel up to another tour of duty?"
12238,Lynette,"hey, you guys know you're not supposed to be out of bed."
10044,Lynette,"we have day care, ed, day care. do you realize that since we fired half the staff, you and i have barely left the building? my kids are forgetting who i am."
13151,Lynette,hello?
13087,Lynette,then we dump her.
12175,Lynette,"i faced cancer and a tornado, but i'm running from this."
8861,Lynette,mary alice was not crazy.
11390,Lynette,no.
10719,Lynette,you know what's really bad luck? marrying a wife killer.
9975,Lynette,what if the stranger is nice and not scary? yes?
9328,Lynette,head lice.
11240,Lynette,"you haven't heard? he has been begging gaby to go on a date with him. he's been sending her all sorts of stuff to bribe her, even a diamond bracelet."
9342,Lynette,#name?
10556,Lynette,i knew that. you didn't have to tell me that.why did you buy flowers for milt's wife?
10164,Lynette,"so that if you're the last man to survive a nuclear holocaust,you could repopulate the planet?"
13205,Lynette,what's his extension?
9330,Lynette,"i, um, excuse me."
12947,Lynette,"because i vividly remember yesterday, and i wasn't born during it."
8995,Lynette,"yeah, well."
8796,Lynette,"i'm sure it's not that bad. he's coming to the party, right?"
11644,Lynette,"okay, okay. give it up, tom."
13253,Lynette,"oh, jeezs."
10670,Lynette,hello.
9764,Lynette,"stu, isn't that the new video conference setup?"
8970,Lynette,"hey, jordana!"
11151,Lynette,mmm.
12996,Lynette,"yes, i helped advertise what companies decided to market. it's the same thing. come on. you know i'd be great."
11700,Lynette,"well, we're giving it back."
11696,Lynette,"no! i am not leaving that woman in charge of our children. in three months, the twins will be chain-smoking, and penny will be an alcoholic. we can manage. we've got mccluskey."
9568,Lynette,you hired your old girlfriend and you didn't tell me for three months?
9245,Lynette,so this is it! this is the secret that mary alice was trying to protect
11086,Lynette,i'm sorry. i thought we were all gonna talk about how to keep an eye on this guy.
9513,Lynette,okay. okay.
9581,Lynette,hi.
10012,Lynette,and i'm gonna take your parking space.
11050,Lynette,"what--okay, watch her!"
9475,Lynette,i will walk you over to mrs van der camp's and we all know what happens when she gets mad.
9717,Lynette,"no. no, no, no, no. no. i'm not saying it has to be sparkling."
11843,Lynette,okay. well--i think i'll turn in.
8821,Lynette,you're wearing a really big hat.
9145,Lynette,you and i have had crushes before. we always tell each other. we laugh about it. it's no big deal. what worries me about this is you're denying you're obviously attracted. why?
11203,Lynette,"aw, come on, tom."
10662,Lynette,you move fast.
10448,Lynette,of course.i will talk to him.i'll talk to him till i'm blue in the face.i promise.take care.
8992,Lynette,that is not fair!
8851,Lynette,so do i.
10511,Lynette,"he's under contract.if you just fire him,he'll sue you, and i'll back him up.you need cause."
11208,Lynette,"so tomorrow, first thing, we'll fix the plumbing, we'll call an exterminator, we'll rent some chairs and we will open on time, and it'll be a glorious success that you will have achieved with my help, okay?"
12247,Lynette,"well, gee, i'm kind of at a loss here, tom. dr. spock didn't have a chapter on how to punish your kids for burning down a building."
8792,Lynette,have you heard anything i just said?
9754,Lynette,"hey. little guy. i just wanted to say i'm really sorry about what happened with the shovel. neither one of us saw that coming. i know it's not much consolation, but you really helped my marriage. that's a lot for a little rat to accomplish in one lifetime. well, it's getting late, so, hats off to ya!"
9682,Lynette,how's that? is that better?
10916,Lynette,"okay. never mind. i'm leaving. first, i'm just gonna give your mom a hug."
13169,Lynette,"tom, you're being completely irrational. we've had sex 23 days straight. i've seen more ceiling than michelangelo."
8993,Lynette,"tom, i am sorry about tonight. truly, but these days, if i'm competing with anyone, it's the bree van de kamps of the world with their spotless kitchens, and their perfect kids, who throw fabulous parties where nothing ever goes wrong. i try so hard to keep up, but i can't."
9529,Lynette,congratulations. you read me like a book. why would you hire that woman?
11848,Lynette,"well, it's back. and since when do you question the mojo?"
9951,Lynette,that is a damn shame.
9233,Lynette,"so here's the thing, i feel really awful about how i acted before."
11572,Lynette,my kids know you're not a witch.
10705,Lynette,right.
11878,Lynette,and that's only possible when you're pretending i'm someone else?
10085,Lynette,"no, no tension.what?"
9537,Lynette,"yeah, i'll check my book. so annabel, do you have feelings for tom?"
9930,Lynette,"well, it's stuck. get the remote! get the remote!"
13138,Lynette,i've gotta say it is. you become more attuned to each other's needs and more sensitive to--
11948,Lynette,bree.
9148,Lynette,it's the basic flaw of your gender. i get it. just do me the honor of-
9087,Lynette,"i wonder what's going on over there. i mean, claire did okay with the kids yesterday, but that could have been beginner's luck. do you think i should call? i should call!"
8786,Lynette,"we didn't exactly forget, it's just usually when the hostess dies, the party's off."
11297,Lynette,"oh, god. seriously? fantastic. thank you. it's just two quick hours, and then we'll get you right back home with your mom. thank you, andrew. okay. bye-bye."
9586,Lynette,yes. it soaked through a little. that is the nature of baby sick. do you want me to wear a haz-mat suit or are you going to be okay?
11477,Lynette,are you kidding? i should be thanking you. we took in three grand tonight.
8929,Lynette,i hate playing three handed poker. let's take a break.
11793,Lynette,"boy, you really don't wanna be here, do ya?"
12769,Lynette,ah.
10017,Lynette,i can't believe you would sink so low. i'm going to ed.
10175,Lynette,"look,it makes perfect sense.we're not gonna have any more kids.and the pill just makes me bloat.it'll be great!"
10850,Lynette,isn't he the one that asked us for a loan last christmas?
9721,Lynette,"you know, for the sake of our marriage, please don't mention the system again."
10814,Lynette,what'd the coach say?
10677,Lynette,"hey, gaby, it's lynette.got a little emergency.is it okay if we use your backyard? great, great, and we take full responsibility for whatever the pony does.hope you get this message soon.oh!"
9239,Lynette,glad to get that off my chest. thank you.
8962,Lynette,okay.
11629,Lynette,no. why would you think that?
9260,Lynette,"look, my boys do not break into people's houses. sure, they may have stolen your flower pot, but you know they apologized for that."
12691,Lynette,wait. what's going on?
10967,Lynette,isn't there anything i can do?
12145,Lynette,"okay, i give you that one. but what about the tornado that just happened? you can't blame man for that."
11465,Lynette,us? what is us?
10449,Lynette,"sweetie?um,could you put the crayons down for a second?we need to talk.so i spoke to your teacher today,and she told me about the--cookie deal you made with cindy lou."
12821,Lynette,"tom, i cannot just stay at home wiping noses. i need it for my sanity, and i need you to back me up."
9785,Lynette,"bill on delivery, yes!"
12061,Lynette,i didn't realize there'd be a cat. tom's really allergic.
13214,Lynette,because i don't want to have plastic surgery.
9797,Lynette,"i hope you're right. at the risk of sounding too sensitive,"" ""how come she gets a bigger portion?"
10261,Lynette,"you know, ed,i've been thinking.we've had a lot of fun and games around here lately,but maybe it's time to set a slightly more profession tone in the office."
13271,Lynette,i'm pregnant.
8814,Lynette,how was your night?
9409,Lynette,"well, obviously she needs to be told."
12214,Lynette,is that where you were during bree's acceptance speech - doing free shots at the bar?
10053,Lynette,okay. okay. i just thought i'd give it a shot.
9345,Lynette,"guys, we should be ashamed of ourselves for reveling in that woman's misery. that being said, edie, please continue."
9579,Lynette,"i told you, honey, daddy and i have a special meeting tonight."
9023,Lynette,thanks!
9637,Lynette,"just stay here with penny for a second, okay?"
9397,Lynette,you're a better woman than me. i would have ripped that open with my teeth. aren't you dying to know what he wrote?
11944,Lynette,don't give him a name. he's not gonna be around much longer.
13068,Lynette,i'm not supposed to drink.
8855,Lynette,"it's like a vitamin, and you'll take one everyday."
11128,Lynette,"no. first, she ripped off its arms, stuffed it with chili. then she threw it in the trash."
9728,Lynette,why are you fighting so hard to sleep on baby vomit?
8731,Lynette,"ooh, you gotta be kidding! i'm exhausted! i look terrible, i'm covered in peaches!"
11809,Lynette,"yeah, i am feeling much better, so count me in. will our new neighbor be coming?"
10582,Lynette,"what are you, a scientist?"
11722,Lynette,you can't stay if i don't want you here.
13127,Lynette,"i was just afraid you'd overreact, like you're doing--right now."
11089,Lynette,so that people could watch their kids and be vigilant.
12672,Lynette,we're going to protect our son.
9490,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, you're back from the hospital already?"
9773,Lynette,"parker, honey, can you hear me? tom, why isn't he talking?"
12292,Lynette,"yeah, or a child with problems can lead to a dysfunctional family. i mean, kayla's the one that got my kids to light a fire and jump off the roof."
9414,Lynette,what a voice.
11336,Lynette,please stop apologizing.
12784,Lynette,"no, sweetie. i was driving home last night, talking with your dad on the phone, and two cars in front of me had an accident. and i thought, damn, that could be me. and then i thought, that could be me."
11478,Lynette,"oh, wow. candles, too?"
9217,Lynette,how could you do something like this to alison?
12573,Lynette,"and when we start stealing to support ourselves, the kids can see the inside of a prison. you're right, tom. it's a brilliant idea."
13144,Lynette,we'll--double up tomorrow.
11707,Lynette,"until your wedding, of course."
11417,Lynette,"fine. i'll, uh, keep looking."
9380,Lynette,"just so you know, i got topher a set of bongo drums. i know you'll love them as much as he will."
11866,Lynette,that's too bad. i had a little fantasy thing planned of my own.
8782,Lynette,i know. preston used the three of diamonds to scoop jam out of the jar.
10939,Lynette,"oh, that's rough. excuse me."
12026,Lynette,"hey, i'm not complaining."
9301,Lynette,what?
12994,Lynette,"not great. see, while i was working at scavo's, i got seven years older, which is weird, seeing as how all the c.e.o.s got seven years younger. the bottom line is, no one wants to hire someone who could have made out with their dad on prom night. anyway, i hear carlos is looking for a new director of marketing. think you could put in a good word for me?"
12507,Lynette,"well, they overshot and wound up in ""bland,"" right on the border of ""sucky."" you need to grab your audience, just grab 'em. i've gone for jazzier colors, bolder fonts. oh, i have really played up the whole nostalgia angle."
8857,Lynette,now open up.
11582,Lynette,"actually, he is bringing in more than enough business to cover his salary. i mean, with all those new dishes he's been cooking, he's got a lot of fans out there."
9326,Lynette,i'll be right back.
9817,Lynette,"oh, i am so sorry."
13178,Lynette,no. no.
9947,Lynette,"you know, what we're saying is, we get it. you're just having fun. it's nothing to be ashamed of."
12162,Lynette,"well, forget it. let someone else help you with your power grab."
11259,Lynette,"when i got shot and i was lying there bleeding, i wasn't thinking ""god, i'm really gonna miss advertising."" i think this could be the best thing that's ever happened to our family. we can make our own hours, we'll be together more, and, yes, the money is gonna be a little tight, but i think this place could be a gold mine."
11084,Lynette,wow. what is all this?
9139,Lynette,"okay. well, you gals, um, shop your little hearts out. see you later."
11179,Lynette,every cent we have is circling the bowl and tom never said a word. why didn't he come to me?
10931,Lynette,it's fine with me--soon as you figure out a way to leave your genitals here.
13198,Lynette,"okay, that's a lousy impression of me."
11079,Lynette,"hey, why don't we start that girl talk?"
13289,Lynette,right.
11078,Lynette,hey! how you doing?
8703,Lynette,hey.
9563,Lynette,she's in the next room.
11213,Lynette,mrs. mccluskey. won't that be fun?
11445,Lynette,i'm gonna be right there. here you go.
9999,Lynette,"i left a proposal on my desk at work. i have to go over it tonight, or you-know-who's gonna have my head."
9748,Lynette,hey.
9484,Lynette,and you know-mrs mcclusky?
11852,Lynette,"oh, i ripped it this morning. it's been itching the hell out of me--and this is much better."
13128,Lynette,what little friendship?
12620,Lynette,what are you talking about?
10914,Lynette,i have been trying to stay away from you--
10542,Lynette,"i love you,too."
11612,Lynette,"what? i'm so sorry. oh, my god. i'm so sorry. that paranoid idiot. you know, i knew it. i knew when we were watching the surveillance tapes that he would completely misinterpret it."
13247,Lynette,so i was thinking this whole going back to school thing deserves a little celebration.
12869,Lynette,"oh, no. it's fine. we use it all the time."
11020,Lynette,"parker? hey! come back here! honey? come on, we're leaving. parker. parker, come on, we're leaving. why didn't you come when i called?"
12992,Lynette,"yeah, this isn't about that. um, i wanted to say i heard about carlos' g promotion. congratulations."
10302,Lynette,"all right,go back in."
9339,Lynette,tammy brennan spent a fortune on topher's party. she'd call in specialists from switzerland before she'd let it be canceled.
11002,Lynette,"hey, sweetie, it's a different market."
10815,Lynette,that's not fair! it's not his fault!
12876,Lynette,we use that parmesan all the time. you can't go changing things without asking me.
11647,Lynette,"cram it! okay, yeah, tom, i've been unhappy lately. i am working through some issues, but that is something i need to do on my own. talking about it doesn't help--not to you, and certainly not to dr. beer pong."
12629,Lynette,"oh, please! you would never do that."
9196,Lynette,"you can do this, all right? just, just scootch down a few inches, and i'll grab you."
10590,Lynette,"okay! okay, okay, porter, just stop, all right? just come on inside, and we'll forget the whole thing."
8721,Lynette,"years! uh, how are you, how's the firm?"
10459,Lynette,i'm home.
10950,Lynette,i'm sorry. i'm sorry. we'll-- we'll be quiet.
9631,Lynette,hello?
12133,Lynette,tom--i'm serious.
11230,Lynette,everything.
10196,Lynette,the talking cows rocked their world.
9562,Lynette,"well, what am i supposed to do? you hire your old girlfriend and you don't tell me for three months?"
12359,Lynette,"oh, i'm with gaby. i mean, you know me. i always like to give people the benefit of the doubt--"
10307,Lynette,what?
9793,Lynette,is that why he's sleeping with an umbrella?
12220,Lynette,okay.
13241,Lynette,"uh. we didn't get that far. i felt faint, and he left to go buy a backpack."
10150,Lynette,not to us.
10332,Lynette,"yes,i am."
9812,Lynette,what are you doing?
10290,Lynette,"oh,my god!"
10339,Lynette,"oh,good.parker,don't put your elbows on the table. come on."
9124,Lynette,tom--
9335,Lynette,"aw, jeez. it looks like a sesame seed."
12195,Lynette,what?
10055,Lynette,yeah.
11422,Lynette,"okay, everybody, go on up to bed. parker, you got the baby. yeah, that's exactly right. you know what to do."
13224,Lynette,what?
9950,Lynette,ah.
8748,Lynette,"boys, guys, i'm begging you, sit in your seats. i'm not gonna tell you again! buckle up! i mean it, so help me, i'll-"
9138,Lynette,uh-huh. a little formal for the mall.
10583,Lynette,"i'm sorry that you saw my panic attack.i won't let it happen again, especially since this is my last pregnancy."
9267,Lynette,what?
11566,Lynette,oh. it must be the basil. it has a kind of sweet smell.
10328,Lynette,"oh,please.i live with you.last night, when you should've been trying to make that pitch work,you were watching the game."
11129,Lynette,nothing.
8825,Lynette,"aww. you know, it's gonna take more than just this one night."

10924,Lynette,"it was awful, as always. i saw she was in pain, and i just walked away and--"
10226,Lynette,"uh, just let your rsum speak for itself?"
9296,Lynette,tom--
9557,Lynette,what's wrong with subtly reminding annabel that you're happily married?
12260,Lynette,i know. turns out the whole thing was kayla's idea.
10300,Lynette,you were sleeping?
12792,Lynette,here's a thought--stop being angry.
10805,Lynette,"that's right. come. walk with me. so, money's a little tight, huh?"
12970,Lynette,"okay, you lick. i'm going to paris."
8844,Lynette,it seems there may be more to mary alice's death than you were aware of .
11491,Lynette,thanks.
8822,Lynette,by reliving your night out with the guys?
12048,Lynette,"hi. did you hear they declared a tornado watch? scary, huh?"
10897,Lynette,"oh, i know them. they live on cypress. they just celebrated their fifty-third wedding anniversary."
11229,Lynette,"no, it's too close."

13123,Lynette,"hear, hear. to friendship. so i want to hear more about the garden club. tom says he's meeting all kinds of nice people."
11890,Lynette,"thanks, sweetheart. hello. oh, yeah. hi, dr. shiller. okay, that's my white blood count. uh-huh, but as long as it's higher than 4.0, that means i don't have neutropenia, right? well, that's great. thanks for calling. yeah, you, too. bye."
12925,Lynette,"tom, it's fine. i'll take the table."
11266,Lynette,austin? what the hell's going on here?
9697,Lynette,could you excuse me for a minute?
9952,Lynette,not a one.
8868,Lynette,"yes, you can tell them how beautifully behaved the boys are."
9391,Lynette,oh.
11369,Lynette,this isn't about the shirt anymore. this is about us working together. every day it's a battle. it's hurting our marriage. you know what? i'll just tell tom i need to step back.
12838,Lynette,"no. i'm gonna go help my daughter with her homework. hey, penny! wait up!"
13275,Lynette,"actually, i have an addendum to that."
9279,Lynette,"my kids have been on kind of a thieving jag, stealing stuff from around the neighborhood."
11071,Lynette,"sorry, i can't talk now. i have somewhere to go."
10094,Lynette,no!
11784,Lynette,"well--i felt a little weird about something that happened at lunch, and i thought we should talk about it."
10972,Lynette,"oh, here they are! hey!"
13179,Lynette,what are you doing?
10817,Lynette,i was trying to repair my son's shattered self-esteem.
11637,Lynette,"yeah, and then you threw up in the trophy."
10753,Lynette,"ah, i don't have a problem.i just don't think we both need to go up there.i can grab kayla and bring her back."
10890,Lynette,"it's a grown-up word, and when daddy comes home, you'll learn a new one: grovel."
13006,Lynette,"he didn't even flinch. i said i was 54, and he bought it. there was not a ""wow, you look great for your age!"" not even a courtesy gasp."
12732,Lynette,"honey, that's porter."
8930,Lynette,why not? fifty cents a bet?
11268,Lynette,austin!
11905,Lynette,"tom, i don't want your opinion, just your vote."
10032,Lynette,i am?
11782,Lynette,gaby?
9467,Lynette,it does work. it does work most of the time.
10697,Lynette,she and turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
12035,Lynette,why didn't you tell me?
9603,Lynette,"tom, what is this?"
10486,Lynette,"ed? hey,i'm so sorry,but obviously that was just meant for tom's eyes only."
11053,Lynette,i want my son.
11537,Lynette,"hey, guys, go check out the snakes. i'll give you some pizza later, okay?"
10428,Lynette,hey.
11634,Lynette,good.
10863,Lynette,and make tom resent me for the rest of his life. i don't think so.
11913,Lynette,you're picking her over me?
12840,Lynette,i can't help feeling there's more we could have done to honor him.
8835,Lynette,malignant?
10087,Lynette,that's all i'm saying.
11941,Lynette,"i can't eat right now, tom. i've got to go to the garden center and get some fencing. god, this is annoying! can't believe you didn't tell me we have a possum!"
9386,Lynette,"i'm going to tell the truth to every mother out there, and then i'm gonna take back the bongos."
12339,Lynette,my neighbors? god! i could strangle that girl.
10243,Lynette,this dinner is really good.
9861,Lynette,"you're welcome, but i really need to get home."
9698,Lynette,"stu, you are an idiot. you're an idiot, an absolute idiot."
8873,Lynette,that's the second time this week. they never used to fight like that when mary alice was alive.
9404,Lynette,"well, lynette loves talking about lynette, too."
10248,Lynette,"well,tom, why don't you pitch him the other idea you came up with last night?you know, the one where people love bacon so much they wanna keep it a secret?"
10909,Lynette,"oh, stop right there. i am the one who should apologize. i have been a bad wife."
12972,Lynette,yeah.
12218,Lynette,no.
11916,Lynette,but it's my kids' tree house. they really need it.
10783,Lynette,tell me something i don't know.
10560,Lynette,"do i? i'm happy.i mean, i was. why don't i just look the other way and pretend nothing's wrong?lots of women can do that."
8741,Lynette,to mary alice.
9539,Lynette,watch your step. tom and i are a team. our marriage is rock solid. nothing you ever do will break us up.
12470,Lynette,"toss it, and keep tossing until this 2-car garage can hold at least one car."
11975,Lynette,i just think it would work better for everyone if you got your own place.
11337,Lynette,"i appreciate what you were trying to do. it was a lovely thought that just went hideously, hideously, hideously wrong."
11090,Lynette,"yep. go ahead, say it. i know you want to."
10655,Lynette,"nora, this is just for our family.i would prefer if you weren't in it."
10671,Lynette,"hey, nora."
12904,Lynette,just know we're 100% behind you.
11781,Lynette,"oh! my god, you guys. i'm so touched you're all willing to do this."
12468,Lynette,you need unopened mountain climbing equipment from 1986? you don't climb mountains.
13191,Lynette,meaning you were in the same class at the same time?
12811,Lynette,oh. i wish you'd caught me two chardonnays ago.
11872,Lynette,"oh, about brandy--bad news."
11723,Lynette,mom.
10136,Lynette,yeah?
10079,Lynette,he played the tuba.i have pictures.
9617,Lynette,she said she might be a little late. they already started moving a few of mike's things over to her house.
12726,Lynette,"do you have any idea how bad this is? we had to post bail. if the judge finds out porter skipped town, we're gonna lose--a lot."
10264,Lynette,ed!
8976,Lynette,"it means come girl scout cookie time, don't bother bringing little tina, because we won't be home!"
10353,Lynette,what--what was what?
9070,Lynette,how can you stay here after the way she treats you?
9259,Lynette,"are you sure you didn't misplace it? you're getting up there in years, no offense, but you probably forget where you put things."
11077,Lynette,"guys, why has it been so long since we've played poker? i really need this."
11954,Lynette,perfect. where can i get one?
12934,Lynette,"well, by the end of the day, we should be able to pay off our creditors, give bree back the $20,000 that we owe her and have enough to live on for--45 minutes."
11483,Lynette,"oh, yeah. i gotcha."
9200,Lynette,yep.
8860,Lynette,"not in so many words, but everything paul said certainly made it seem like she was schizophrenic."
10266,Lynette,"yes, you're right.this is your company,so i'll play by your rules.what do i have to do to get you to stop this frat boy crap?shave my eyebrows?come to work naked?name your stakes."
12465,Lynette,"hi, dave."
9816,Lynette,oh. that must have been ugly.
10731,Lynette,"i'm so unhappy. ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives i can't even work up a smile. and the more she pushes the more i resent tom. tom. for something he did twelve years ago. and i'm afraid if i can't fix this, that the anger is just going to fester until.."
13298,Lynette,"i just told them to paint something nice, the sentiment is all theirs."
12710,Lynette,wait. slow down.
13042,Lynette,pardon?
11499,Lynette,"oh, great. now we know she's watching us."
9962,Lynette,hey.
11482,Lynette,don't you have any friends to hang out with?
9118,Lynette,"i know. the way she was talking about mrs. huber, it was like she was already dead."
12353,Lynette,and go where? i can't get within 500 feet of my children. are you not up to speed on the people vs. lynette scavo?
9359,Lynette,"edie, if you want me to share stuff with you, you're gonna have to start being more supportive of susan."
12343,Lynette,"oh, susan. he's adorable."
11758,Lynette,yeah.that's rough.by the way--i have cancer.
9350,Lynette,i can't believe how lucky you were today.
12179,Lynette,"oh, well, that's nice. thank you."
12853,Lynette,"because the people that you love may not be able to pay you back, and then you stop loving them."
12571,Lynette,"okay, let me ask you one tiny question about this big adventure plan of yours who's gonna be running our restaurant while we're off doing the electric kool-aid acid test?"
12092,Lynette,"hahaha, so her niece and nephew are taking all this stuff back to nebraska?"
8946,Lynette,"well, these things happen. oh, i'll be right back."
12825,Lynette,in a minute. i'm trying to lock this job down. what kind of perks are we talking about here?
9870,Lynette,you're gonna take me off kamarov because i won't go drinking with you?
9895,Lynette,"yeah, well, this one was the most expensive. the other ones aren't as nice. but look. look, look, look, look at me, look at me. watch. i don't walk in it. i glide."
8915,Lynette,"i'm sorry, i thought you were kidding."
10784,Lynette,"hey, parker, where's your uniform? you got your game in an hour."
12197,Lynette,"yeah. no, he was here."
12955,Lynette,you're grieving. i get it. but this sounds like a fantastic job. please just hear the guy out and make a nice--impression.

12447,Lynette,aw. that's sweet.
13013,Lynette,why?
12485,Lynette,"oh, tom! she's up in her room."
9360,Lynette,"what do friends do? they call, they're sympathetic, they ask about the pain the other person is going through, and then they listen."
13307,Lynette,i'll see you at home.
9497,Lynette,"um, mrs mcclusky, thank you, that is very nice."
11359,Lynette,"well, you gave me no choice."
12178,Lynette,"hey, tom. look who's here--rick."
10169,Lynette,"yeah,well,why don't you have your second wife make you lunch,okay? oops!"
10591,Lynette,"no, no!"
12067,Lynette,knock yourself out.
12939,Lynette,"the hard part was when my friend tried help me with a loan, and i thanked her by becoming a lunatic and denting her car."
10260,Lynette,here you go.
12193,Lynette,"uh, yes."
12034,Lynette,kinda.
11026,Lynette,"you don't get it. his house had this creepy vibe. tell him, tom."
12891,Lynette,"when times get tough, people do without things like pizza."
12504,Lynette,"well, gee, i don't know. i guess the same place that you find time for your garage band."
12997,Lynette,you guess? gaby--
13048,Lynette,"oh, sweetie, those aren't to play with, not unless you wanna see someone go completely bonkers. actually, they do look like a lot of fun. if only i had the power to stop you--"
10598,Lynette,what?
11281,Lynette,i consult you.
12843,Lynette,"he's inside, but between sobs, he wished you happy driving."
11960,Lynette,why?
12575,Lynette,how about the crazy married couple throwing drinks? how are they gonna be?
12696,Lynette,the d.a. says you were spotted coming out of the storage room right before the fire started. what gives?
12785,Lynette,"porter, listen to me. bob talked to the judge. he thinks he can get them to drop the charges."
10098,Lynette,the teenager?
10176,Lynette,"oh,i know! i know!but it is what married people do.they go out of their way to calm each other's irrational fears.oh,come on,tom.i really need you to do this."
9738,Lynette,"well, you look amazing."

10289,Lynette,hi. excuse me.hi.you called and you said my kids are here?
12215,Lynette,you go alone?
9162,Lynette,i remember talking to her right before she disappeared.
12180,Lynette,"well, i-- i've got some work to do."
12694,Lynette,"yes, sweetie, we are."
11017,Lynette,okay.
9450,Lynette,"because i'm having drinks with friends i used to work with and they never call and if i blow them off that's it. i'm dead to them. no, i can't call patty binks, because she steals things. dammit, christy, you're thirteen years old, you've got a lot of trips to the mall ahead of you. ok, ok, i'm sorry. i'm sorry i raised my voice, i'm calm. i'm starting to think this is about money so what is it that'll make it worth your while? a hundred? that's extortion, there's no way in hell that i'm gonna. hello, hello?"
11140,Lynette,"hey,whoa!whoa,whoa,whoa!okay. what the hell are you doing?! stop, stop! stop screaming! stop!"
13102,Lynette,"mm. i just took a shower, and i know where you're going with this--"

11402,Lynette,"great. come on over. your application"""
8747,Lynette,let's say we do. there's a chance we're not gonna like what we find.
8806,Lynette,"well, if the food's late, god help you."
10718,Lynette,the point is alma disappeared under very suspicious circumstances.
10058,Lynette,i work because my family needs me to.
12640,Lynette,"okay. well, your minute's up."
11646,Lynette,"no, no."
8922,Lynette,"all right. i think everyone is down for a nap. we've got no more than an hour. let's get cracking. five car draw, nothing wild."

13023,Lynette,"yea, i do."
10293,Lynette,"oh,yes.oh,yeah,me too. thank you."
10054,Lynette,okay.
10296,Lynette,"are you judging me?because if you are,you couldn't say anything"
9113,Lynette,they're full of iron. could you make sure they clean their plates?
12258,Lynette,do you have any idea what you've done? someone could have been killed.
9808,Lynette,"i couldn't find mrs. mulberry's umbrella so i brought her her sun hat instead, all right? and, here we go."
11709,Lynette,"nothing. same old, same old."
10233,Lynette,so did you do that solo?
8722,Lynette,yeah.
11321,Lynette,"well, we've been going there for the last seven years. it's not exactly a surprise. anyway, i hope you don't mind, but i canceled."
9262,Lynette,get out of my house!
11064,Lynette,you're right. i need to talk to someone.
10137,Lynette,oh?
12437,Lynette,really? can anyone talk to him?
12083,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
12341,Lynette,you have got to be kidding me!
9541,Lynette,"wow, things are really coming along."
9556,Lynette,show?
13263,Lynette,"this is lynette scavo. may i please speak to dr. rushton? tell him it's important. dr. rushton, i need to come in and see you as soon as possible. i think the cancer's back."
8749,Lynette,i have a theory.
10197,Lynette,"uh, well, i rewrote some of the stuff we worked on,but, you know, essentially, it's the same, and they ate it up."
9680,Lynette,what's the matter?
9186,Lynette,"i'm just picking up my sick poor little baby boy. all right, here."
10057,Lynette,excuse me?
11300,Lynette,wait. where are my chairs? i didn't order these.
9402,Lynette,"only for first time guests. normally you'd be having, um, chicken fingers and cartoon shaped macaroni."
9791,Lynette,you couldn't have given them coffee or something? i just feel like i'm missing out on their lives entirely.
12964,Lynette,"oh. actually, i have 12 years of experience."
10864,Lynette,"that's great. hey, can we talk about this restaurant thing for a second?"
10644,Lynette,"well, to be clear, how are you going to live? how are you going to pay the mortgage?you don't have a job here."
10357,Lynette,tom--
9147,Lynette,"we are not going anywhere until you confess you have the hots for our nanny. tom, it's okay. she's attractive. men by nature are drawn to fertile young women with whom them can plant their seed."
10958,Lynette,how can you say that?
12962,Lynette,"you can have mine. stop saying, ""i don't know."""
10926,Lynette,do you think he knows mary alice shot herself in his living room?
12305,Lynette,ask me if i love tom right now. go ahead. i dare ya.
10077,Lynette,we've got day care!
12432,Lynette,"your friend gets busted for dealing drugs at school, and all you have to say is, ""i guess""?"
11877,Lynette,what are you doing?
10806,Lynette,"yeah, i heard your old man's out of work. that's gotta be tough."
10803,Lynette,"i'm gonna go buy him an ice cream. it's okay, p-dog. you're gonna get 'em the next inning! so tell me, what else do you know about this nicky kid?"
12131,Lynette,we should go to church.
11785,Lynette,"oh, not that. okay, i don't know how to say this, so i'm just gonna say it. when everyone was offering to come with me to chemo--even katherine, who i don't even know, you sort of clammed up. what was that about?"
9044,Lynette,"yeah, that's why i was hoping to take advantage of your expertise."
13060,Lynette,thanks. i'll watch it during chemo if i'm not too tired.
12445,Lynette,"okay, okay. you're right. you're right."
10853,Lynette,"well, hey, we're celebrating, right?"
11560,Lynette,"yeah. um, i told kim that we'd be out the rest of the evening and she's gonna lock up."
9893,Lynette,"okay, don't be distracted by that. look at me. here i am tomorrow, making my presentation."
8978,Lynette,"oh, i'm fine. i just need some coffee."" ""thank you."
9862,Lynette,"um, why don't you ask trudy? she loves going out."

9057,Lynette,"oh, yes."
13040,Lynette,i brought you a little gift.
11393,Lynette,that is a great idea!
9954,Lynette,"well, that sounds expensive."
10253,Lynette,"guys, please--that's--all right."
9080,Lynette,"fine, fine. be three-foot-eight the rest of your life. see if i care. good luck finding girlfriends!"
9411,Lynette,excuse me!
9268,Lynette,i'm not going over there.
10122,Lynette,"i'm just here to say i am sorry,and i have been a complete idiot."
9222,Lynette,because i kicked him out of the house.
9679,Lynette,"okay, let's get outta here. tom?"
10479,Lynette,you're kidding!
8718,Lynette,"not now, honey, mommy's threatening daddy."
10902,Lynette,"well, maybe you should try to patch things up with him."
9734,Lynette,okay. welcome to the promised land. go on! there! good job!
9549,Lynette,"excuse me. i need to get in here,so i can clear the plates."
12653,Lynette,"no. so if you see him, please tell me."
11271,Lynette,what are you doing here? i fired you.
12213,Lynette,"the open bar is no longer your friend, huh?"
12519,Lynette,"durber. hey! well, this was one great guy. he would schlep all the way across town just to get me my chinese food. so--what are you up to?"
8743,Lynette,what're you doing? that's private.
9955,Lynette,"look, mcclusky, i am as worried as everybody else in this neighborhood, but i just don't think that we-"
9901,Lynette,"you saw the walk, right? you wanna see the walk again? i'll tutor parker myself."
12582,Lynette,that's right. you're a realtor.
13094,Lynette,you're in a garden club?
13220,Lynette,you know what would be more educational? you going to college like we talked about.
9684,Lynette,"remember that time when you were away in tucson, and i had a 104 fever, but i still managed to take the kids trick-or-treating?"
10463,Lynette,"uh,yeah. of course.no,sorry."
10074,Lynette,"you're welcome. you need to find a better way to communicate with your wife. and, fran, i know what the pressure of trying to be a super parent does to your head. you can take a break and be a great mom. doesn't this little sweetheart deserve a well-rested mommy?"
11737,Lynette,muriel.how are you doing?what's up?you look good.
9089,Lynette,yeah. i don't really think i could videotape claire. it would be a breach of trust.
9418,Lynette,that was fun. you play really well.
9657,Lynette,hey!
13150,Lynette,"uh, tell him i'll call right back."
13190,Lynette,back up a second. you guys were classmates?
10483,Lynette,"guys,i'm all for bashing exes,but let's save a little of our hate for his partner in crime--the other woman."
11902,Lynette,my kids' tree house. can you promise you'll leave it alone?
10259,Lynette,but--
11711,Lynette,"well, i don't know how you did it. the kids are asleep, and the cough syrup hasn't been touched."
12826,Lynette,"i swear, if you touch this phone, i will have this baby right here and then beat you with it!"
11196,Lynette,"really? well, what if i were to very briefly refresh your memory?"
10710,Lynette,"oh, i'm working on a seating chart for bree's wedding."
9678,Lynette,okay.
13074,Lynette,now--where's that one-armed friend of yours? i'm--wanna shoot some stick.
13293,Lynette,"parker, i swear i will spank you, knock it off."
12177,Lynette,"great, actually. we're great."
10529,Lynette,we're a team.i'm just lending support.
9462,Lynette,the hell i'm not.
9468,Lynette,my mom used to beat the hell out of my sisters and me. and i won't do it. i will not become my mother.
10461,Lynette,oh.
10067,Lynette,you took the baby without telling fran?
10417,Lynette,you're saying bree did this?
11679,Lynette,"hey, i'm starting to get worried about bree. maybe we should call."
10611,Lynette,isn't your aunt named penny?
13188,Lynette,sorry. i got nothing else. come inside and eat your pork.
8797,Lynette,"you know what, it's not gonna change until you resolve your issues with that man."
9155,Lynette,"yeah, i noticed that, but every time i come here, it's full."
9442,Lynette,"tom, am i a bad person?"
13054,Lynette,"well, if she knew what you're about to do for her, she'd forgive you for everything."
10843,Lynette,hi. yes-- i am. what is all this?
12923,Lynette,what's going on here?
12975,Lynette,"oh, you were. you were the best person who ever worked for me. i used to be his boss."
9018,Lynette,go to hell.
11428,Lynette,"but you can't bend at the waist, and that pretty much leaves the heavy lifting to me."
12250,Lynette,wait a second. those are your chores.
9171,Lynette,"well, yeah, i know it hurts, but that's what you get when you let your brothers put bubble gum in your hair. pain and misery."
12625,Lynette,"okay, that's it. i'm calling her."
8777,Lynette,"let go of me! what's the matter with you? run, boys, run!"
12924,Lynette,"guys, easy."
9185,Lynette,"hi, sorry."
11556,Lynette,what?
12555,Lynette,oh. hi. what happened?
12001,Lynette,it's like you're saying you don't care about her. at all? and i don't understand that.
9383,Lynette,and the best you could come up with was letting my kids take the fall?
8716,Lynette,"paul. we have to leave now. once again, i am so sorry for your loss. go!"
11683,Lynette,"hey, you wanna hold it down up there, kids? i'm trying to talk to your aunt lucy! thank you!"
10462,Lynette,no.
12725,Lynette,what the hell is going on? where's porter?
9083,Lynette,you have my cell phone number. you call me if you need anything.
11031,Lynette,it was a thank you cake. he sort of saved my life.
9101,Lynette,"where is she, by the way? i haven't seen her in days."
12417,Lynette,--in your father's convertible.
10895,Lynette,"fine, gaby! don't say hi!"
9378,Lynette,i see topher's made a speedy recovery.
12647,Lynette,"okay, well, just so you know, i hit back."
13232,Lynette,oh.
11538,Lynette,"all right, i'll see you later."
12636,Lynette,good. i'll see you downstairs.
8791,Lynette,"oh. tom. there'll be liquor. and hors d'oeuvres. and grown-ups without children. and, and silverware. remember silverware?"
9288,Lynette,how was your day?
12650,Lynette,i went over to talk to anne about recent developments.
11920,Lynette,liar. you're campaigning. cookies--nice touch.
11907,Lynette,i'm sorry. i didn't catch that.
12506,Lynette,"well, who knew your marketing guys were such lame-os? what they came up with is so--tepid."
12791,Lynette,"last time i came, you threw pudding at me."
11366,Lynette,i told you orange meant something bad was gonna happen.
10026,Lynette,"and that wasn't right of her. she shouldn't have been having sex with you. she's upper management. technically, it's sexual harassment."
10397,Lynette,"come on,baby birds don't jump out of the nest.they need to be pushed."
12240,Lynette,"oh, something he did that made mommy really mad."
9890,Lynette,what's wrong with the blue suit?
12118,Lynette,"oh, yeah. okay."
12633,Lynette,"so do i. and if you ever lay a hand on him again, you will find out just how much."
11350,Lynette,"orange says, ""beware. something bad's gonna happen."" that's why they use it for life vests and traffic cones and convicts. also, it washes me out completely."
13092,Lynette,i say we keep showing up here until he lets us help him.
12911,Lynette,"you're putting us in the cheapest nursing home you can find. yeah, i got it."
13004,Lynette,"okay, i'm gonna stop you. what is this obsession with age? i am a vital woman with passion and a library of knowledge when it comes to this industry. why doesn't that count for something?"
12579,Lynette,"amy, don't worry about the lunch specials. i am only two blocks away. i'll take care of it once i--actually, you do them. i'm gonna be a while. tom? tom?"
10060,Lynette,bye-bye.
12181,Lynette,that's you?
12863,Lynette,"yeah, yeah."
13015,Lynette,"i--don't know. well, he'd have to match my current offer."
10859,Lynette,"care to elaborate, dr. mccluskey?"
10484,Lynette,"yeah, ""honey,you're the love of my life.she's just the runner-up."""
11170,Lynette,oh.
12968,Lynette,i'm getting this job. that's what i'm doing.
11490,Lynette,sometimes.
9618,Lynette,"yeah, it's nice to see susan so happy again."
10829,Lynette,i'll get my checkbook.
12704,Lynette,"well, i try."
8885,Lynette,hey.
8952,Lynette,"yeah, i didn't think so. and just so you know, next spring when we do bambi, his mother is going to take a slug to the heart, and you're going to like it!"
11678,Lynette,"if you're that freaked out, just get married without the bracelet."
12499,Lynette,"well, back before i consecrated my life to mozzarella, marketing was sort of what i did."
12867,Lynette,yep. just adding the parmesan.
12236,Lynette,okay.
10370,Lynette,"mmm.whoa. hello.what's going on,huh?"
9036,Lynette,"that is so like you, edie. you're always thinking of others."
9602,Lynette,sound asleep.
9521,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, we're going to be late for the doctor."
9157,Lynette,"i hope someday, you have lots of children."
10458,Lynette,good luck.
10046,Lynette,"well, maybe if i talked to her."
9166,Lynette,yeah. tuesday's poker day.
12300,Lynette,oh. well--s-sure. i've been very good to her.
9042,Lynette,"i know. and i know we can't afford it. and i know everything that's happened is my fault. but, if i don't get some help, there's an excellent chance, i will lose my mind."
9704,Lynette,seriously?
10469,Lynette,because--it's rude.
11826,Lynette,ya ha i'm sorry. i didn't mean to--okay.
10635,Lynette,"sorry, that's penny's baby monitor.it's always picking up weird frequencies."
11669,Lynette,i would never cheat on you. you know that.
9110,Lynette,hi.
9248,Lynette,boys! get your little fannies inside. guys?
9558,Lynette,i did not mean it that way.
12560,Lynette,"so i'm thinking no more electrical work, okay?"
12119,Lynette,"damn it, karen. i'm running out of ida."
13069,Lynette,"no, thanks."
9243,Lynette,"mrs. mccluskey, why are you taking my flower pot?"
11272,Lynette,hey! you hired him back? did he tell you he was stoned on the job?
13299,Lynette,"okay, great. like your dad said, it's time for bed."
10327,Lynette,"if you really wanna do this now, shut the door.okay,sure, i was a little bitchy.but you know why? you did a half-ass job in there."
12254,Lynette,"i need to ask you something, and i want you to tell me the truth, okay? did you have anything to do with the fire at rick's restaurant?"
9971,Lynette,okay.
10663,Lynette,that's cute.
12749,Lynette,"okay, we'll get a - we'll get a restraining order."
9619,Lynette,mike's a decent guy.
10114,Lynette,you're kidding.
13056,Lynette,"or what, i'll turn to stone? she's all rough and gritty."
13079,Lynette,she called me a baby factory?
11029,Lynette,he wasn't technically home when i went inside.
10318,Lynette,"you put my kids in danger,and then you lied about it.do you not get how big that is?do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?"
11523,Lynette,why would you say that?
8812,Lynette,"when tom and i were first married, things got a little out of hand on mr. toad's wild ride."
12113,Lynette,"hey, you've abetted. might as well aid."
9823,Lynette,i don't know. maybe i shouldn't be working.
9130,Lynette,good morning.
12744,Lynette,"porter, it's mom. where are you?! porter!"
12255,Lynette,"i'm looking for a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer here."
10309,Lynette,i've known bree for years and years.there's no way she was drinking while baby-sitting my kids.so--just go spread your poison somewhere else. okay?
9689,Lynette,"great. listen, uh--"
8800,Lynette,it's a frat party.
9834,Lynette,parker.
10807,Lynette,"no! a kid's gotta have an allowance. how else you gonna buy the things you want, right? like that cotton candy. that's a little piece of heaven, huh? hey, i got an idea. maybe we could help each other out. my son's having a little trouble hitting the ball."
10283,Lynette,"so,here's the deal.um,there was a little miscommunication,and as it turns out,we don't need ya."
12709,Lynette,"oh, sure."
8981,Lynette,i knew this play date was a good idea.
9591,Lynette,tom!
12815,Lynette,i was planning to go back to work.
10429,Lynette,okay.
8739,Lynette,"he got smoke inhalation, he's at the hospital."
10225,Lynette,great! great!
11427,Lynette,you wanna have sex? but you're immobile.
12224,Lynette,"andrew, do something! do something! stop it! stop! oh, for god sakes, what is the matter with you? what are you, 12 years old? stop it. jeez."
10062,Lynette,you're mindy's father. you have a right to spend time with her.
9238,Lynette,"and just so we're absolutely clear, i am definitely not your mother, because if you ever betray me, i will leave you. i will take the kids, and i will walk out that door, and you will never see any of us again."
11689,Lynette,"well, in that spirit, as soon as i start chemo, i will be giving up shampoo."
11668,Lynette,"i said that it was totally inappropriate, and then i fired him."
11991,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey.no, no, no. you are not leaving those here. hi, mom. take her away."
11109,Lynette,"good.yeah, okay.so give her some room.hey,wow,look,are those presents for kayla?yes,they are."
11200,Lynette,really? that's great!
10022,Lynette,oh course i noticed! you are one of my favorites and i thought it was really unfair how it all went down.
9486,Lynette,i'll get the door.
9821,Lynette,i couldn't have imagined how much going back to work would upset parker.
12046,Lynette,"gaby, you just got married."
12410,Lynette,"hey, susan?"
12116,Lynette,"she played third base, right?"
10540,Lynette,anything else going on?
11063,Lynette,please don't bring up the supermarket again.
11374,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, tom. tommy--okay, okay, you're breathing. that's good. that's good."
13046,Lynette,"hey, i got you sodas, didn't i? and i let you feed the paper shredder."
11276,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry. let's hear them. what are your reasons for bringing back joe bong hit?"
11480,Lynette,"why? you know he'll just shoot it down. i mean, i get it. he's in pain. he doesn't like being sidelined, but that is no reason to--you know what?let's talk about something else."
8763,Lynette,"well, like i said, i should go back and get dinner ready."
10673,Lynette,"no, no, no, of course not. in fact we're just having a quiet afternoon at home.the kids are so bored tom and i were thinking about taking them out for ice cream."
12109,Lynette,"fine. and for what it's worth, you passed bi*chy ten minutes ago."
9062,Lynette,"well, look on the bright side, tom's having the time of his life."
12533,Lynette,coupons.
11412,Lynette,"you know how stressful it is working in a four-star restaurant, and he, like many chefs, started using cocaine just to stay ahead--"
11947,Lynette,"okay, we're done talking here."
11429,Lynette,"is that why you apologized, just so i'd-- service you?"
9910,Lynette,"but then i started thinking about it, and you know what? i'll be damned if i'm gonna pitch to a roomful of people who are all wearing armani and vera wang, while i'm standing there with two-year-old breast milk crusted on my lapel."
9064,Lynette,you should never take this dress off for your entire life!
11746,Lynette,no! it's too late!
11365,Lynette,i'm going home.
10755,Lynette,"oh, that's-- delightful. that's delightful. maybe it'll just soak up the cream soda you spilled."
9128,Lynette,what?
12160,Lynette,bree--
10340,Lynette,huh?
12251,Lynette,"no, sorry. i hope you find him."
9430,Lynette,"i'm sorry, what?"
8940,Lynette,"um, sure."
9960,Lynette,does your dad know you're out here?
9329,Lynette,"hey, guys, over here."
9655,Lynette,we should talk about this seriously before we make any rash decisions.
10593,Lynette,i've got nothing to say to you.i just called because i had to.
9606,Lynette,"you know, i kinda like it."
10298,Lynette,"well,thank you so much!"
9435,Lynette,"alisa, come here."
9158,Lynette,"hello? oh, hey, susan. listen, i can't talk, i'm in the middle of something here. what?"
12234,Lynette,"well, it wouldn't be the first time. you lied about the brick, and you were pretty smooth, too. hell, i bought it."
12074,Lynette,that is not true. i genuinely care about you.
12645,Lynette,damn it.
10056,Lynette,yeah.
11293,Lynette,"i know. i'm the one that put in the order. i will handle anything that needs to be done. and you, take these and get some sleep."
11363,Lynette,"later i'll be asleep, and then i will be back here before you wake up. we gotta deal with this now."
10371,Lynette,"oh,i get it. i get it.ooh! this is your idea of driving the train.and it's very manly and really impressive,but it's really,really bad timing.you can't be serious.mmm. we're gonna--we're gonna be late."
12593,Lynette,"not a bed-- a futon, like a couch."
10224,Lynette,tom--
9774,Lynette,"oh, hey, honey, this is so exciting. your first day of school. you're going to make so many friends."
8984,Lynette,i bet--can i use your bathroom?
10436,Lynette,that's fantastic!
10746,Lynette,"well, why don't you give them to the kids?"
8988,Lynette,exactly!
11698,Lynette,"what, someone loaned us ten thousand dollars?"
12928,Lynette,i think this can all wait until morning. don't you?
13243,Lynette,i know tom. he's going to learn how to count to ten in chinese then he'll get bored and move on to his new dream of becoming a beekeeper.
10658,Lynette,"no, that's fine.wow, white gloves.what are we having lunch in the 1880s."
10251,Lynette,"i'm sorry,i thought we were here to talk about the farm fresh rollout?"
12319,Lynette,mm-hmm.
13021,Lynette,hey. what are you doing here?
9611,Lynette,"you told me duggan's coming back to work today, i thought i'd do something special for him."
9709,Lynette,"makes you wonder, doesn't it?"
11218,Lynette,your new manager? no.
9496,Lynette,"okay, i love you too. bye bye."
10977,Lynette,"there she is! hi, my little bunny!"
12613,Lynette,i followed you to the warehouse. i know everything.
10809,Lynette,"yeah, well, after all those fastballs--come on, parker! you can do it!"
11787,Lynette,"nobody likes hospitals. unfortunately, that's the place you have to go when you're sick, or your friends are. you are my friend, right?"
11818,Lynette,"yeah, about that-- i don't think i'm gonna make it."
9056,Lynette,"well, if we had a nanny like you at my house, we would treat her like gold. did i mention i have four very loveable kids?"
12574,Lynette,fine. i'll get you a towel.
9225,Lynette,that's it?
12217,Lynette,"right, right. it's just--if anyone thinks you did, it'd be handy if you could prove them wrong, wouldn't it?"
11165,Lynette,"hey, it's me. you wanna meet for lunch?"
9981,Lynette,'cause i've got an important assignment for you.
11950,Lynette,"not as much as me. i put out poison, but it ate around it. i got one of those humane traps, but all i trapped was penny."
12072,Lynette,of course.
9210,Lynette,oh.
12898,Lynette,"if we sell this place now, we can escape with some dignity and maybe even some money. but if we keep on going like we are, we're gonna lose everything."
10106,Lynette,no.
12086,Lynette,"okay. you really, really, really think so?"
12324,Lynette,"at this point, because of the way you're acting. please don't do this, kayla. we have been having such a nice time."
9869,Lynette,"oh, fun, but i can't go tonight because i promised the twins that i would help them finish their science project."
11244,Lynette,there you go. great. guess what? our line is the biggest one at the fair. i counted. you know what i'm starting to think?
11303,Lynette,give me that.
8862,Lynette,boys! stop it! go to bed.
8945,Lynette,"uh-huh. ah, incidentally, who is 'they', as in 'they forgot to tell the printer'?"
10957,Lynette,"yeah, yes, i will, i will, i will. i will love her like she is my own. i will, nora. nora? nora!"
9376,Lynette,yes.
10657,Lynette,ten seconds.
9221,Lynette,yeah--
9892,Lynette,okay.
12580,Lynette,"so funny. i was gonna ask you the same question. but i was gonna start with ""what the hell?"""
11183,Lynette,"mr. gaunt? hi, i'm lynette scavo. my husband is opening the pizzeria right down the block--"
11541,Lynette,"edie asked me to cater. i know, i'm a total who*e, but please don't rat me out to gaby."
9307,Lynette,"i'm sorry, but you should have consulted me."
9351,Lynette,"really? wow, you're good."
9820,Lynette,thank you.
9879,Lynette,happily married.
9207,Lynette,"in the future, checklist means 'is it in the car' not like, 'do you remember', okay?"
9926,Lynette,"well, you should be polite and watch it too. you know they're your guests."
9159,Lynette,"okay, boys."
10930,Lynette,she's tom's daughter. you can't just take her out of the country.
11327,Lynette,let it go--that's cute. start talkin'.
10505,Lynette,"oh, god!"
9904,Lynette,oh. thanks.
10432,Lynette,"no,i don't hold her responsible.bree van de kamp and i have known each other a long time.i trust her completely.she's a wonderful friend and a fantastic mother.she puts the rest of us to shame."
10116,Lynette,come here.
12407,Lynette,"you do! this is tom, former high school nerd, living viciously through his awesome-ass kids."
12132,Lynette,"ah, it's just--we've been through a lot lately, and we have a lot to be thankful for. don't you think we owe the big guy a little face time?"
8916,Lynette,"oh, okay."
12421,Lynette,"tom, relax! you high-spirited kids do whatever it takes to have fun."
9525,Lynette,"well, i'll let you get back to work. i'll see you later."
13175,Lynette,that is so sweet.

9524,Lynette,"it uh, must have slipped his mind."
9466,Lynette,"yeah, you're damned right she did. she could've tried something else, like a time out or she could have simply threatened to spank him."
10778,Lynette,"no, i don't wanna fight. in fact, i was thinking--if you can't find something you like in advertising, maybe you should cast a wider net."
12364,Lynette,"okay, so at the risk of cracking these eggshells i've been walking on all week, any idea when you're gonna stop being so angry?"
10157,Lynette,i'll call the office.
10729,Lynette,"i'm sorry, i was desperate. i had a little too much to drink and you are divorcing carlos."
10968,Lynette,he's a bachelor.

12556,Lynette,uh-huh.
12457,Lynette,"i know that you have only been the receiving end of break-up letters, but i've actually written a few, and i know how to let him down easy."
9922,Lynette,"well, they look fine to me."
10396,Lynette,"yeah,well,in the third world,they don't have juice boxes."
9656,Lynette,we should-- talk about this.
12361,Lynette,"bree, you can talk katherine up all you want, but she is just never gonna be one of us."
12466,Lynette,"hey, tom?"
10082,Lynette,"yeah, i am.i don't--i don't want to make a big deal out of it,but, uh,could you maybe not do that again?"

13027,Lynette,"no, you won't get the chance 'cause i'm gonna kill you first. the houselights are up, gaby. you can drop the act. you only helped me get this job because you needed a spy."
11994,Lynette,"i also had cancer for four months, and if i could've asked one of them to leave, i'm not sure which i would've picked."
12656,Lynette,stop it! go on! go on! go on!
9494,Lynette,i'd invite you in but-
8874,Lynette,"oh,that sounds great."
9493,Lynette,i don't know what to say. it's stunning. thank you.
10476,Lynette,what?
9112,Lynette,"you're the best. oh, one more thing. since the boys are having corn dogs for dinner, i'd like you to make sure they get a vegetable to go with it."
12842,Lynette,"hey you go, walter. she's all yours."
13308,Lynette,you better not be apologizing for me!
11527,Lynette,"oh! the boys would love that, but unfortunately, i gotta work."

8887,Lynette,"yes, yes, come on!"
9775,Lynette,"uh, right, yeah. i'm going to be right there."
12495,Lynette,i thought you were the one who said you wanted to spend more time with your family.
11740,Lynette,i can handle it.
11241,Lynette,his grandfather left him all that money.
9731,Lynette,"no, you come on! just get up! get up!"
12576,Lynette,"no, i get it. the sports car, the garage band--maybe what we need now, tom, is for you to get it."
8935,Lynette,i'll finish the costumes.
9460,Lynette,"tom and i don't believe in hitting our kids, i thought you knew that."
9752,Lynette,"wow. so, um, i, i take it you took the rat outside?"
10634,Lynette,what if you pull out his key chain?
10854,Lynette,mm-hmm.
11022,Lynette,"oh, i just say so. come on."
8699,Lynette,santa's cell-phone number.
11065,Lynette,"he'd gotten rid of everything--the toys, the pictures, everything was gone."
11621,Lynette,hey.
9009,Lynette,"boys, i can hear you out there. now be quiet. just sit there and color."
8785,Lynette,"hey! i know, our dinner."
12797,Lynette,poor eli. we should make sure he's got flowers at his funeral.
11959,Lynette,"no way. he's here, tom. i can tell."
12174,Lynette,"oh, well, i'm pretty comfortable with the catholics. they're the only ones who don't judge me for having so many kids."
10174,Lynette,with a vasec to me.
10659,Lynette,what are you being so coy about?
11862,Lynette,"gaby, i am his wife. he's supposed to love me--not my body, me--my--my soul. why can't he make love to my soul?"
9574,Lynette,we started to but then *huh* you fell asleep.
12313,Lynette,"we tried to be your friends, but you don't even understand what that word means, so now we're gonna be something you do understand."
12355,Lynette,how can you talk like that? what else has to happen for you to get what's going on here?
13122,Lynette,this dinner is delicious. you really didn't have to do this.
11493,Lynette,you're kidding.
10272,Lynette,i'm coming!
10799,Lynette,"hey, people, he's just a kid, okay?"
11764,Lynette,"it's a little uncomfortable, but i'm fine. take a card."
12528,Lynette,"yeah, mm. great."
11004,Lynette,"i'm only gonna be in there ten minutes, i promise."
11307,Lynette,"hi. i need to rent fifty chairs by tonight at five o'clock. what? why not? what do you mean, it's bar mitzvah season? there's no such thing. you still have five. i will take those. scavo."
9235,Lynette,"you're right. you're right. i guess i just got so upset because - oh, whatever, let's not beat a dead horse, it's over, i'm sorry, good night."
11397,Lynette,"arnie, thanks for coming in. we will definitely keep you in mind."
9052,Lynette,"claire? i've always loved that name. so claire--"" ""do you come here often?"
11338,Lynette,hideously.
12044,Lynette,it does. it really does.
11234,Lynette,"don't touch me, okay?"
12983,Lynette,really?
11206,Lynette,"gambling with our life savings and not asking for help doesn't make you a man.it makes you an idiot. come on,tom,for god sakes, we are a team, and that restaurant is a huge undertaking. no one could do it alone."
9390,Lynette,"oh, i'm sorry! i thought--"
12719,Lynette,"well, actually, i wanted to borrow edie's yellow sweater for the, uh, arraignment."
13163,Lynette,"oh, okay. uh, coffee will be fine."
11945,Lynette,"honey, i put up a fence, and he burrowed right under it. the man at the garden center said these are crafty creatures, and there's only one way to stop 'em."
10037,Lynette,"yeah. sure. i'll, i'm gonna go and take care of that."
12760,Lynette,"sweetie, where are you?"
11609,Lynette,there. hey--i made you an espresso.
10234,Lynette,ed--
11377,Lynette,"so that's it? he threw out his back? oh, thank god."
11530,Lynette,"well, yeah, i guess i could work somethin' out."
9810,Lynette,"well, why didn't mrs. mulberry volunteer that information before i turned your room upside down looking for it, hmm?"
9944,Lynette,"hi. sorry for just showing up unannounced, but, um, could we talk to you for a minute?"
9286,Lynette,"honestly, i don't think mike did it either, but if we don't call, we're guilty of withholding evidence."
11516,Lynette,"oh, my god. how do you botch a bikini wax?"
12096,Lynette,ida? i have trouble seeing her as the leadoff hitter for anything other than osteoporosis.
11107,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey!"
9073,Lynette,dishes?
12463,Lynette,"hey. mind if i join you? okay, i know what i did--was unforgivable. and i am not trying to make excuses, but--we used to talk all the time, and then one day it just stopped, and it killed me. i felt like i lost you. and then i was saraj, and i had you back, and we were talking again, and you were telling me thin."
9615,Lynette,"oh, yeah. i wanted to do something nice for duggan."
9740,Lynette,"well, i'm very sorry for your loss, too, phyllis."
10514,Lynette,"no,no,you should keep it."
11807,Lynette,i don't know. you came out with some interesting things before you swore off the sauce.
10351,Lynette,"of you? no,i'm not."
13310,Lynette,"seriously, stop or i will hurt you."
12170,Lynette,"oh, you don't have to do that."
10641,Lynette,"as the mother of 80% of tom's children, i don't think it's in their best interest for you to drive us into bankruptcy."
13153,Lynette,yes?
9991,Lynette,"and we integrated the corporate logo into the jungle background creating not only an ad for the clothing, but for the company, itself."
8708,Lynette,oh.
12751,Lynette,"before i became a mother, i didn't know it was possible to love another human being so completely, and with that love comes this need to protect you. it wasn't a decision i made. it's--primal. it's just something in my dna whatever it is, it makes me not care about myself, and it reminds me that my reason for being on this planet is to look after you kids."
9762,Lynette,all right. i didn't know it was that important to you. i will talk to my boss and i will see what i can do.
9512,Lynette,have you been taking your arthritis medication?
9202,Lynette,i'm so happy to see you. it's such a shame that alison couldn't make it.
12157,Lynette,"no. i just put 10 bucks in the collection plate, and i'm gonna get my money's worth."
11152,Lynette,he already did.
9523,Lynette,"oh, thank you. and you. you're here. in the office. tom's office."
9857,Lynette,are those the same clothes you were wearing last night in the bar?
13162,Lynette,"morning. oh, sorry. i don't have time for breakfast."
11116,Lynette,"dinner's ready. kayla, i made your favorite--tacos. here you go."
9016,Lynette,i know you're not.
12590,Lynette,hum.
9077,Lynette,she's a total nightmare.
12702,Lynette,"tom, if you're gonna freak out, can you do that in the other room? i'm kind of busy here."
11739,Lynette,okay.i'll jump right on it.
9941,Lynette,norma--
12717,Lynette,shut up!
13108,Lynette,i don't. carlos does.
9945,Lynette,"so, um, we've been trying to contact you, but you haven't been returning any of our messages."
12161,Lynette,"oh, then you won't get what you want?"
11522,Lynette,what?
12758,Lynette,"we can get a restraining order to protect you, and bob thinks there's a good shot at getting the case dismissed."
11488,Lynette,did you read our review in the paper?
11288,Lynette,"oh, honey, you have had, what, four hours sleep in the past three days? you need rest. who cares if we run out of breadsticks?"
13194,Lynette,"i know, right? he must take care of himself."
9597,Lynette,"i used to be the fantasy. there was a time when i didn't need a maid's outfit because i knew i was enough for you, even wearing a smelly t-shirt. and clearly, that's no longer the case."
11042,Lynette,i didn't notice.
9361,Lynette,then it's good to know how to bluff.
9939,Lynette,"i need these play dates. tom, we need these play dates."
10524,Lynette,i can't believe that son of a bitch hired a forensic accountant.he's more whipped than i thought.
9469,Lynette,-we're screwed.
10218,Lynette,i know! i know! i know.so who's up next?
9782,Lynette,ladies' room.
11988,Lynette,"oh, yeah. where is that waiter? i'm gonna go find him."
8761,Lynette,you're kidding.
11237,Lynette,"oh, my pills! i need my pills, and now they're all dirty!"
9551,Lynette,"they never get to see you, let them stay up for a while."
10107,Lynette,okay. yeah.so exact what are you doing here helping out?
10118,Lynette,"oh, yeah."
10762,Lynette,nah.
13193,Lynette,"okay, i went a little overboard. you know me-- two margaritas, and i need a muzzle."
9923,Lynette,same time next week?
10138,Lynette,why are you telling me this?
13109,Lynette,"no, i went into carlos' bathroom, closed the door, then stripped naked and took a shower."
10608,Lynette,i said i wanted penny.
9084,Lynette,okay. you boys. come here and give mamma a three-bear hug.
9527,Lynette,three months?
13012,Lynette,"well, thank you, greatest friend, but i just accepted another job."
12427,Lynette,"no, listen. this is important. when they were little and they'd act out, and we'd always say, ""relax! they're young. when they're older, they'll get it."" well, tom, they're 16 now. not getting it. we have a lot of work to do in a very short time, and if you and i aren't in sync, i'm afraid it's not gonna happen."
9605,Lynette,oh my god!
11681,Lynette,bree!
9987,Lynette,maybe.
12069,Lynette,"no. no, no, no, no, no. you stay here."
12317,Lynette,i just--it's good for us to hang out. i enjoy it.
9336,Lynette,"yeah, well, there's lots more where that came from."
11012,Lynette,"but my other son, parker. so. back to the favor."
12467,Lynette,why are there two piles?
11333,Lynette,"oh, i couldn't relax. i just kept replaying the fight i had with tom in my head."
12722,Lynette,what took you so long?
13057,Lynette,"oh, please. we're talking about edie. a little more irreverence is what we need."
12192,Lynette,"no, i'm pretty sure the blind qualify, too."
12402,Lynette,don't you think you were kind of sending the wrong message in there?
12335,Lynette,"for what it's worth, i keep my floors incredibly clean."
10433,Lynette,no.
10247,Lynette,i can't protect you.you're gonna have to find a way to click with ed yourself.
10504,Lynette,i didn't!i didn't.why would she--oh!the honeymoon thing.
13117,Lynette,"hey, carlos, quick question for ya. last thing i remember, i was in the shower, naked, reaching for the soap. then i was here on the bed, under a blanket--still naked. and my question is, how did i get from there to here?"
12128,Lynette,"katherine, we didn't come here to upset you."
12850,Lynette,what's this?
10687,Lynette,"no, i'm not telling."
12546,Lynette,"and the rest of the stuff--you'll find a way to fix it. just know that all your friends are very proud of you. bitterly jealous, but proud."
9989,Lynette,well-
12919,Lynette,"okay, you make the salads. i'll handle the register."
11081,Lynette,"we're not gonna play cards, are we?"
9522,Lynette,you forgot your helprin file.
9471,Lynette,"no, no. i'll fish it out later, alright.? you're off the hook for tonight, but not you two so start brushing. preston did you not hear me? i said start brushing your teeth."
11675,Lynette,is one of them cancer?
12731,Lynette,"bob, you've been going at this for over an hour. why don't we take a break?"
9647,Lynette,"you know, i didn't tell you to quit."
11706,Lynette,you are now officially the most beautiful bride that ever lived.
9219,Lynette,but your take on this is you're the victim?
11597,Lynette,yeah.
9403,Lynette,hey. shut up.
11704,Lynette,"great, so in the middle of everything i'm dealing with, you're gonna throw rick in my face."
9178,Lynette,"no! no! i, i planned ahead."
8926,Lynette,because now no one on the play committee even wants to talk to me.
10236,Lynette,"well--um, let me just call in a few references before we make anything official."
9035,Lynette,"well, mrs. huber never showed up. why don't you wear this one?"
9187,Lynette,"excuse me. sorry. sorry. excuse me. excuse me. hey, lauren! hi. we had a really rough morning."
13266,Lynette,"if it's cancer, and i find out you knew, i won't be dying alone."
10344,Lynette,i'm sorry.i'm sorry. i am sorry.
11423,Lynette,"well, you might also want to apologize to the customer who found a lego in her pizza."
11149,Lynette,"well, you could tuck me in."
11176,Lynette,"no, he didn't. don't, um, restaurants make half their money on the liquor?"
9659,Lynette,you're right. i'm sorry.
9177,Lynette,we're here! woo! ten minutes early! sign me up?
11164,Lynette,"hey, you banned me from your opening."
9889,Lynette,"no, actually, i have quite a few others. uh, the blue one, and uh--"
8816,Lynette,oooh. who cracked anyway?
10059,Lynette,"i bet. make no mistake, i'm a good mother."
10213,Lynette,i'm not saying that.
9293,Lynette,"well, whatever works for ya."
12370,Lynette,"no, no, give me another chance. i will get it."
12050,Lynette,"well, if this tornado watch gets upgraded to warning, we're gonna need a place to wait it out."
12531,Lynette,"guys, i am just gonna offer her a little advice. geesh."
10584,Lynette,"well, don't encourage him."
10580,Lynette,"then--then you go in for an ultrasound, and you hear two heartbeats. then and only then does your husband tell you that twins run in his family."
12512,Lynette,but mine is better.
9304,Lynette,oh my -- what? what? the whole west coast? i thought you were going after an in-house position.
9001,Lynette,woo. that stuff is strong!
12338,Lynette,have a seat. i'll be with you in a second.
12306,Lynette,"hey, honey, could you get that? thank you."
12172,Lynette,well--there are some things that are easy to believe in.
10168,Lynette,then why have it?
11867,Lynette,"lynette's not here right now. i'm brandy, the slutty cheerleader."
11603,Lynette,"no, no, i'm just cold."
9507,Lynette,"i don't know, tom, i think something's happened to her."
10485,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
9300,Lynette,oh.
9865,Lynette,pals?'cause sometimes it's hard to tell. you know i wasn't feeling the love today when you mocked my campaign in front of the clients.
9629,Lynette,"geez, nat, you make me feel like some kind of shark. ah, okay. you know, actually, if that's the kind of exec you're looking for--"
11956,Lynette,shh!
11804,Lynette,"hello? oh, hey, bree. mm, what's up?"
10329,Lynette,i saw you!
12285,Lynette,okay. all right.
12280,Lynette,there are so many opportunities that you could look and see what's going on. i am not!
10961,Lynette,"who cares?!who cares?we all have pain! everyone in here has pain, but we deal with it! we swallow it and get going with our lives! what we don't do is go around shooting strangers!"
9261,Lynette,you know what? this has been fun but now -
8726,Lynette,now what.
12615,Lynette,huh?
10006,Lynette,sure.
8854,Lynette,not exactly. this is a special kind of medicine.
8697,Lynette,"stop it, stop it, stop it. stop it."
9828,Lynette,hi.
10466,Lynette,that is ridiculous.
8802,Lynette,"no! but when i say, we've been invited to a party, don't whine about your exhausting 60-hour week. put on your dancing shoes, and take the mother of your children out for a good time."
10002,Lynette,edie! i am sure susan's father will like her just fine.
10100,Lynette,guess what? ed loved the pitch.i got off early!
9746,Lynette,honey?
8968,Lynette,"no, no. let's, let's do it."
9086,Lynette,okay.
10837,Lynette,"don't you dare! you are gonna chase your dream, and i am gonna support you 99 % of the time."
9229,Lynette,"no, he should never have been with her in the first place!"
12028,Lynette,"oh, crap! now where do you think you're going?"
12915,Lynette,"well, clearly, that's not true because you're not a baby. you're 15, remember?"
12776,Lynette,do you know what's going on with porter? the fire? the arrest?
10678,Lynette,"okay, kids.come on, come on!"
11278,Lynette,"yeah. i just wish you'd told me before you rehired him. i mean, i am the manager."
12592,Lynette,um--neat or rocks?
12518,Lynette,"hey! everyone, this is my old assistant, stu, um--"
9819,Lynette,uh huh.
10772,Lynette,i'm sorry i said that about tom. he's doing his best to find a job.
8925,Lynette,she's a total nightmare. i guess i shouldn't have challenged her.
10035,Lynette,"okay. i get nina, but why are you firing everybody else?"
8845,Lynette,"hey paul, what's up?"
9849,Lynette,so why don't you go out and get in the game?
10467,Lynette,"no,i'm not gonna shame my son."
9331,Lynette,"stop scratching. stop scratching. now, now, stop it. guys, let's go, okay? stop scratching. i mean it. stop, stop."
10011,Lynette,great!
9623,Lynette,"i know it seems like we're ganging up on you, but you're moving so fast we thought a sort of intervention was necessary."
10083,Lynette,thanks.
9837,Lynette,"i don't know. it could be a little boy in, uh, england named spencer."
11368,Lynette,"exactly, and i'm supposed to wear that every damn day."
9755,Lynette,"hey, guys!"
9377,Lynette,"hey, tammy."
10728,Lynette,"well, i thought you might need a change of clothes. yeah, you're still mad at me, huh?"
12668,Lynette,what about rick's restaurant? porter and his brother burned that down.
12547,Lynette,fine. i'll get you a towel.
10691,Lynette,gonna go buy a pinata?
9232,Lynette,"no, he's not."
10900,Lynette,"oh, god, here she goes again. what grade is he in?"
13134,Lynette,yes. and we shall never speak of this again. i am embarrassed enough.
12778,Lynette,okay. i know you're mad. i know we have a lot to hash out between us. but don't take your hate for me out on your grandson. now where is he?
12037,Lynette,i don't think that's how it works.
10959,Lynette,i did not want this. don't you dare say that i wanted this.
12588,Lynette,"oh, right. and, kirby, tell your mom thanks. that place she found for tom is already paying off."
11838,Lynette,"what is wrong with you? i told you, i didn't want any pot."
9807,Lynette,thank you for that.
9314,Lynette,sure.
9993,Lynette,"could you can the attitude, nina?"
12675,Lynette,your husband's blaming porter.
11018,Lynette,shh! that's a secret. hello? hello?
11931,Lynette,i know that--here. but here--it feels like i've ruined their childhood.
10220,Lynette,tom cavos?
11102,Lynette,i will love her like she is my own.
9281,Lynette,read the engraving.
13053,Lynette,mm. why don't you start with the time she tried to steal your comatose boyfriend? that was fun.
10282,Lynette,we will find someone--someone who doesn't remember what they were doing the day lincoln was shot.
11847,Lynette,"next month, so i have some time before i start feeling like total crap again. and i was hoping we could put that time to good use."
10038,Lynette,this is not what i wanted. i just wanted you to be nicer.
12893,Lynette,what is this?
10750,Lynette,"hitch?you mean, like, we're going to be driving in the car together?"
10526,Lynette,"no,no!we are not backing down.i'm gonna walk over to ed's office right now,and i'm gonna make very clear that if you're out the door,i'm right behind ya."
11162,Lynette,"what? i am snarky because i point out one small, glaring mistake?"
12371,Lynette,uh--there are no wings.
12805,Lynette,"yes, 'cause that's what women in their eighth month really crave--more stove time."
12062,Lynette,"ida, is there any chance that we could put little toby upstairs?"
8920,Lynette,yeah.
10418,Lynette,i'm just telling you what the lawyer said.
13257,Lynette,marketplace?
12489,Lynette,we can't accept this.
10808,Lynette,yeah. ever seen one of these?
8733,Lynette,i love you.
9076,Lynette,"if i don't get some help, i will lose my mind.where can i score some high-grade nanny?"
10269,Lynette,"so-- can this be a place of business again,ed?no more games?"
11344,Lynette,"jeez,are you crying?"
11120,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry. those are the rules."
9921,Lynette,"no, not to worry. i got the feeling they were sort of enjoying themselves."
10953,Lynette,"okay, i gotta keep the pressure up to stop the bleeding!"
12443,Lynette,you're probably right. it's just--did you know porter writes poetry?
8882,Lynette,that's wonderful.
11969,Lynette,hey.
10204,Lynette,"oh, the pickings are slim.so far none of my top choices are available.hey, um, do you have someone from your old company that you could, you know,maybe recommend?"
12523,Lynette,"well, it's really my husband's. and i'm still doing some freelance stuff."
12848,Lynette,it's okay. just keep it under your hat. it's a little embarrassing.
11467,Lynette,why are you being so stubborn?and you would rather see the restaurant fail than succeed with rick's idea!
9382,Lynette,how could you do that?
9542,Lynette,it'll be worth it. you're doing an amazing job.
9473,Lynette,"preston, don't listen to them. back away from the toilet and no one gets hurt."
12884,Lynette,home. tell me how the party i threw for you turns out.
9855,Lynette,wow.
11607,Lynette,"yeah, i guess we were."
12777,Lynette,"no, no. we have this great lawyer. he thinks he can get the case thrown out."
13186,Lynette,"i think you mean ""ttering."" sorry. please, don't hit me."
10773,Lynette,he doesn't hate advertising.
12129,Lynette,"no, we came here. we wanted to help you, to fix you lunch or clean your house. or offer up our own houses for you to clean, if that's your thing."
12013,Lynette,"oh, my god. it's the police?"
8901,Lynette,and that's what i told them.
12244,Lynette,you did what?
9373,Lynette,"here's the thing. acting like parents won't assign blame is like pretending they don't keep score at pee-wee league games. it's human nature. if you don't give the moms someone to blame, they'll pick a scapegoat. i can't let my boys be the scapegoat."
11069,Lynette,"well, believe me, rita, he scares me, too. you know what? we should have a meeting, get all the moms together and figure out what to do about this guy. saturday, your house. sounds good."
9343,Lynette,"it's been one day, and they've been disinvited to a birthday party. if rumors start flying, these boys can kiss campouts and pool parties goodbye."
10177,Lynette,thank you.
10040,Lynette,"so, he poisoned rex?"
12537,Lynette,"oh. i know. you've got your book and--and your big fancy award, and i'm just a housewife."
12782,Lynette,she's so angry at me. she's never gonna tell us where he is.
12742,Lynette,yeah.
12348,Lynette,what's going on?
11535,Lynette,"you know, maybe i should go. um-- it's part of the job to check out the competition, right?"
12563,Lynette,"okay. okay. we'll find more. just rest now, okay?"
11013,Lynette,"hey, parker. i want you to meet our new neighbor, art. he lives in the house across the street. his sister has the cool wheelchair with the joystick."
12515,Lynette,she won't be glowing when that agency sinks her book.
10355,Lynette,is this about me being boss again?you gotta get over it.
10793,Lynette,"yeah, well, that's not the point.what kind of message are we sending if we let him quit whenever the going gets rough?"
11903,Lynette,that sounds like a no.
11408,Lynette,"but seriously, why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint?"
9265,Lynette,think so?
9295,Lynette,i forgot how much fun you are when you're bitter.
11032,Lynette,"he doesn't care about the cake, tom."
10988,Lynette,that would be great. i really appreciate it. okay. thank you.
11251,Lynette,"uh, on the mend, but i'm gonna be there bright and early monday morning."
10515,Lynette,"let me see.gaby,she's being deported.xiao-mei,is this the first letter like this you've received?"
12483,Lynette,how in the world did that happen?
8931,Lynette,"um, ladies. we all grew up with little red riding hood, and we survived it, scary stuff and all, so i say, to hell with political correctness, let our kids experience this classic like it was meant to be enjoyed. let's kill the damn wolf, and just put on the best show we can."
13256,Lynette,"hey. don't sweat it. you wanted to learn chinese--mm, we'll get you a book."
9438,Lynette,"alisa, i am so sorry if i caused a problem. i just wanted to help."
9915,Lynette,carbon--fiber--shafts.
8950,Lynette,your sorry ass. we're throwing down.
9353,Lynette,thank you.
9005,Lynette,"it pisses me off. i've got four kids, you know. i was up all night reading statistics online. one out of every four traffic accidents happens on residential streets. i hope whoever hit juanita gets put away for life."
12242,Lynette,mm-hmm?
8713,Lynette,here.
12377,Lynette,what?
12406,Lynette,"no, i mean you think they're cool in that you wanna be them."
10922,Lynette,i had the mary alice dream again last night.
11444,Lynette,"well, but he's been clean for almost a year."
9724,Lynette,"oh, that's disgusting."
12227,Lynette,"well, for starters, mr. coletti opened his restaurant to get back at me because i wouldn't have an affair with him."
8923,Lynette,might i suggest the barcliffe academy production of little red riding hood?
9002,Lynette,"so, has anyone been over there?"
12259,Lynette,but it doesn't matter! intentionally setting a fire is a very serious crime. don't you get that?
9141,Lynette,"oh, how can you say, she was so your type, big breasts, really curvy."
9492,Lynette,"oh, mrs mcclusky, you don't have to."
12316,Lynette,"well, i know, but we're supposed to be spending time together, not going into debt. oh. how about this one?"
9665,Lynette,"uh, no. i can't. you're very, so--"
12399,Lynette,i really appreciate it.
10347,Lynette,yeah.i wonder if there's any way that we can turn it around still.
12231,Lynette,"rick, look. you know me. if tom had done something like this, do you really think i would protect him?"
12665,Lynette,"you might wanna go ahead and give him those pain pills, doc. he's gonna need them."
11914,Lynette,"yes, but that was before your best friend threw her scarf in the ring."
9058,Lynette,what?
12464,Lynette,"okay. well, for what it's worth, i loved our conversations, and i'm-- going to miss them."
12205,Lynette,"yeah, we were sure one of you would end up killing the other."
8848,Lynette,"paul, i'm so sorry."
11485,Lynette,"oh, well--thanks. this is delicious."
8979,Lynette,'dana.' where did this come from?
10179,Lynette,you're not limping.did everything go okay?
9241,Lynette,where did you guys get this pot?
11001,Lynette,to the market.
9788,Lynette,"you're gonna be great, parker. i love you."
11059,Lynette,you're damn right there's a problem. i can't find my son.
8784,Lynette,yeah.
10888,Lynette,"'cause he decided to take it in his pizza place.not this pizza place.it's a rat hole.but once your dad comes to his senses and stops being petulant, he'll come home."
13208,Lynette,"well, like you said, it's your face. come on, i'm dying for you to meet bruce."
10796,Lynette,"easy hours, big paycheck, access to great parties--yeah, what was i thinking?"
12461,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god! why didn't you say something?!"
11587,Lynette,the restaurant did close a half-hour ago.
11400,Lynette,my fault for asking.
11765,Lynette,"hey, i told you i'm collecting queens. pay attention."
9213,Lynette,"well, um, we don't want to be late for the game. nice to meet you!"
12266,Lynette,"i am just saying, apple--tree. maybe not so far."
12892,Lynette,"tom? come here. we haven't had a customer in about a half an hour, so maybe we should just--close up early."
9511,Lynette,"uh, mr mullins had a spare. why didn't you open the door?"
9792,Lynette,"i'm sorry, who?"
11110,Lynette,"hey,look at that. preston gave you a harmonica. isn't that cool? oh ""harriet the spy."" sounds mysterious."
9272,Lynette,"fine, i'll do it."
9198,Lynette,okay. just wait.
10348,Lynette,yeah.
12289,Lynette,this is dr. dolan.
11514,Lynette,"what do you mean, we?"
11961,Lynette,"this is not a joke, tom. something has attacked our home, and when that happens, you don't just stand by-- you fight it. screw this creature that has come into our lives uninvited and is trying to destroy us. it will not defeat me."
12420,Lynette,don't thank me. thank your father.
8695,Lynette,touch every inch of your body until you're trembling.
9796,Lynette,"i agree with you to a point when they're flying kangaroos or giant robots, not surrogate mommies."
10751,Lynette,"ah, it's like an eight hour drive."
12886,Lynette,"you know that was an accident, right?"
9149,Lynette,my husband won't admit that he has lust in his heart. can you give us a minute?
10408,Lynette,i heard about that.andrew's asking to be emancipated?
9051,Lynette,i'm lynette.
11677,Lynette,i know her plane landed on time. she'll probably be here any second.
9371,Lynette,of course.
11875,Lynette,"brandy's history, tom. let her go."
12146,Lynette,"well, sure. i'm easy. thanks."
11673,Lynette,is it a concussion?
12148,Lynette,"yeah, and i'm breaking her in tonight. nothing like that new bible smell."
11724,Lynette,what did the doctors say?
8948,Lynette,"maisy, we have kids the same age, which means there are years ahead of us, having to deal with each other. so instead of playing all these petty games, why don't we put an end to this right now."
10007,Lynette,"tsk, tsk, tsk. having sex with the support staff. that's a big no-no. ed's been known to fire people for that sort of thing."
11113,Lynette,"this is nellie. my grandma gave her to me when i was little, and i was hoping you could take care of her for me."
13143,Lynette,"i'm totally slammed, which is why i'm calling. it looks like i'm gonna be here late tonight, and by ""late,"" i mean past midnight."
12793,Lynette,"the ball game is going to end whether you like it or not. i would like to be here with you for whatever time you have left. but for that to happen, things have to change."
11883,Lynette,yeah.
10145,Lynette,sounds like a plan.
9650,Lynette,what does that mean?
11125,Lynette,"whoa, whoa, whoa! sit your butts down!"
9502,Lynette,"here, you should take this back. i don't have a place for it."
12736,Lynette,no!
9559,Lynette,keep your voice down!
11504,Lynette,i think it's a shame you didn't make any for yourself.
10816,Lynette,"not nicky, too!"
9643,Lynette,"okay. okay. could we go home and talk about this, please?"
9029,Lynette,"then i started taking the pills because they gave me energy, but then i couldn't sleep at night, and i was getting so tired in the daytime. and, it totally messed me up. i love my kids so much. i'm so sorry they have me as a mother."
10887,Lynette,"yeah. a little.but that's okay.that's okay.we still love each other very much.but just like kids, sometimes grown-ups throw tantrums and need a time-out."
11367,Lynette,"tom, it's me again. you should've been home thirty minutes ago. i know. you're still mad. i am, too, so why don't you come home and we can be mad together? see you soon."
11111,Lynette,"and what did you get for her, porter?"
9325,Lynette,okay.
12265,Lynette,well--yeah. think of what that poor girl has been through. and on top of that--her mom was kind of a psycho.
12585,Lynette,"well, it's just--i saw you two together, and i--i didn't know that you were-- and she looks so--for god sakes, tom, the woman has to be somewhere. just sign the damn lease."
12235,Lynette,excuse me?
12522,Lynette,"no, i-- also went into business for myself."
10712,Lynette,"hey, sacrifices must be made, tom!"
10097,Lynette,"oh, you're kidding!"
12134,Lynette,"so i'm clear, you can't be bothered with saving your eternal soul because the pistons have no defense?"
10214,Lynette,i'll go.
8832,Lynette,"they don't have attention-deficit disorder, and i'm not going to drug my boys just to make your job easier. i'd rather change teachers."
12610,Lynette,what's wrong with you? you've been antsy all night.
12746,Lynette,"but you have been talking to him. what the hell, preston?!"
12056,Lynette,i am asking you as a friend. please?
11674,Lynette,stop. just--stop. what is it you think i have?
12473,Lynette,and i wasn't!
8801,Lynette,"margarita, cigar, sombrero."
12897,Lynette,"i did, for seven years. now i'm gonna be a realist, and i need you to be one, too."
10475,Lynette,but we're not presenting for another two weeks.why don't we start tomorrow?
11198,Lynette,hey.
13174,Lynette,tell me.
12188,Lynette,"gaby, since when do you come to price warehouse?"
12730,Lynette,here's what we're gonna do. youno questions. you--you're porter now. let's go in. come on. come on.
11007,Lynette,yeah? okay.
9739,Lynette,"absolutely. well, i can't imagine what you're going through."
9867,Lynette,no.
11645,Lynette,"really? and what do you call this, ambush therapy?"
12165,Lynette,really? okay. how?
10194,Lynette,"no, the cow part--that could work.we'll-- we'll make them into characters.we'll humanize them. oh!i know! i know!celebrity cow spokespeople!"
12820,Lynette,you did not just say that.
11725,Lynette,what the hell happened? how could she pull a stunt like this?
12905,Lynette,"tom, what the hell are you talking about?"
9111,Lynette,"yep. um, i'll be home late, so just the usual routine. a nap for penny, and-"
9727,Lynette,of course it is.
11716,Lynette,"nothing happened between me and rick. yes, he came on to me, but unlike you, i controlled myself."
11699,Lynette,"no! tom, you didn't ask my mother?!"
11987,Lynette,okay. okay. okay. good for you. i'm sorry.
11606,Lynette,"and he makes them with pancetta and garlic and olive oil. it's really, really good. it's gonna be our special tonight."
11343,Lynette,nine years--and i have loved every minute of it.
12679,Lynette,"good luck. anne? when the baby comes, you don't contact porter. you can contact tom or me, and we'll do what we can for you from a distance. understood?"
12982,Lynette,"i was talking about that job tonight and trying to convince bruce i was good, and i remembered something. i am good. and i would like another chance to prove it."
8803,Lynette,"can't, i already cancelled the sitter."
11860,Lynette,"after two months of puking my guts out, last night i was finally in the mood, but tomnot so much. apparently, my bald head is a big turnoff for him."
12471,Lynette,hey.
11131,Lynette,you know what might solve something?if you were home once in a while.you're the one she listens to.
8891,Lynette,so he just blew you off?
9020,Lynette,the scout meeting is today?
11884,Lynette,"oh--my god. i haven't, have i? i am one of those--whiny, self-involved sick people."
12482,Lynette,"hey, is everything all right? oh, my!"
11657,Lynette,fine. let's have sex.
12098,Lynette,"you realize we're cleaning, right? we're not eating candy."
8767,Lynette,"okay. uh. oh! uhh. i'll be right back, mommy'll be right back."
12322,Lynette,"honey, we're about to have dinner."

9569,Lynette,"oh, that's fine. i wanted to talk to you about something."
11457,Lynette,"sorry. i'm sorry. but it's gonna be worth it. okay, so tell tom the secret of your risotto."
9979,Lynette,"tom, you're not off the hook here."
10605,Lynette,"yeah, we're going home."

9627,Lynette,"he's more then solid, tom's ideas are spectacular. he's passionate about his work. his visual instincts are off the chart."
11040,Lynette,bye.
10129,Lynette,"well, well--yes,i overreacted.i think you can see how even though i was somewhat off base,you were a little wrong,right?"
9983,Lynette,"uh, no. actually, i need you to kidnap my children."
10940,Lynette,"hey, nora. how's tricks? i thought it was your car i saw in the lot."
10306,Lynette,excuse me?

12057,Lynette,thanks. and don't worry. i'll have a talk with my kids. i promise they'll keep a lid on the destruction.
12900,Lynette,"oh, boy. i think i know what this is about. listen, kids, things have been tough down at the restaurant, and i think your dad has finally decided to sell it."
11825,Lynette,that's me! the ninja!
11887,Lynette,you suck. well--i guess i could give candy a whirl. are the kids really asleep? 'cause i think she might be a screamer.
10423,Lynette,"uh,all the bells and whistles,but listen--i really wanted to tell you how sorry i am."
11502,Lynette,"it's just-- it's something yucky, honey. go on and play with your ball. go on."
12121,Lynette,oh!
9097,Lynette,"well, what's wrong?"
12440,Lynette,me. i'm 16 and cute. i like graphic novels and tokyo police club.
13059,Lynette,"eh, same."
9412,Lynette,are you saying i can't be tactful?
9641,Lynette,you did not.
12888,Lynette,"yes, i do. and the minute we're back on our feet, i am gonna pay back your investment--every penny, with interest."
10685,Lynette,"oh, apology accepted.you want me to walk you to your car?"
11433,Lynette,don't cry. just clean.
11534,Lynette,"no, it would be, but sunday nights are kind of crazy. i'm packing lunches and checking homework--"
8738,Lynette,she was having sex with some guy when the fire started.
9311,Lynette,"oh, we went out for burgers and the boys knew you wouldn't be home till after, um, bedtime so we decided to pop in and visit the new vp"
10828,Lynette,are you asking for a bribe?
12320,Lynette,okay. good times.
10045,Lynette,"see? all we need is a minimum participation of, uh--sixteen kids. my kids, your baby, sally in accounting has three, that new guy in human resources has two and we hit the mother lode with the mormon receptionist. she just popped out number six. there. sixteen."
12024,Lynette,yeah. it's the one good thing you get from a crappy childhood.
9675,Lynette,"with all due respect, nina, won't be an issue. i can leave home at home."
9452,Lynette,"oh, um, my babysitter cancelled"
9875,Lynette,yeah.
11087,Lynette,"well, that's what we think, but we don't exactly have proof."
10878,Lynette,it's a burner-downer.
10846,Lynette,"oh, my god! you know what you wanna do! that's fantastic! what is it?"
9900,Lynette,"oh, no. come on, tom. not this one."
9620,Lynette,that's right. did they ever explain that?
10736,Lynette,hi.i'm ready.
12856,Lynette,although--how would you like to own a piece of an italian restaurant?
13240,Lynette,chinese?
9096,Lynette,"no. she's fine. i just wanted us all to spend the day together, you know, like we used to. here we go. once upon a time there was a young turtle named harvey. every day harvey would all tell the other turtles, ""one day i'm going to fly off this island and go see the world."" the other turtles laughed and said ""turtles can't fly."" oh, it's getting good now, huh?"
10445,Lynette,"oh,my goodness."
13081,Lynette,"come here. i'm afraid we have some bad news. your mom was in a very serious accident, and i am so sorry--but she passed away."
12902,Lynette,i don't know that's why we all have to be really supportive. are you with me?
12657,Lynette,hitting women and children? you must be so proud.
9370,Lynette,so which kid is it?
11735,Lynette,yes.it proves they eat sitting down.
12147,Lynette,"hey, church buddy. look what i got."
11760,Lynette,"i just liked being able to throw on my wig and join you guys for a cup of coffee and a good gossip about the new neighbors.you know,for five minutes,i could pretend i wasn't a sick person.but once your friends know you're sick,you can't pretend anymore 'cause you can see it in their eyes--the fear,the pity."
11258,Lynette,"i had so much fun at the fair today, working with you on something that was all ours. i want every day to be like that."
12493,Lynette,"i'm married to a 45-year-old man who has a red convertible. yeah, i think i know."
12624,Lynette,"her name is mrs. schilling. she was your t-ball coach when you were 6. by the way, does your best friend know you're sleeping with his mother?"
12356,Lynette,"no, you are trying to stay on the fence while i fight to stop kayla from destroying us. but look around you, tom. look where i am! you have got to do something now. fix this."
9800,Lynette,"all right. ah. so, what do you think you are going to have, huh? jelly? cause i think i'm gonna have a bear claw."
9543,Lynette,"look, you're basically a predator and i need your advice."
12514,Lynette,really?
12049,Lynette,"oh, yeah. you're welcome. um--can we stay in your basement?"
11911,Lynette,"hey. listen, i promised tom i wouldn't knock myself out campaigning for this homeowners thing, so i was hoping you could help me--you know, ring some bells, talk me up, that sort of thing?"
12599,Lynette,okay. bye.
10840,Lynette,"i don't know how these rumors get started. no, parker only quit the team 'cause he hurt his ankle."
12930,Lynette,"not a dent. a fist print. my husband's been a little frustrated lately. on the plus side, it matches the shoe print on the dishwasher."
12812,Lynette,"i know, but mommy's still planning eli's memorial. start without me. i'll be there in a little while."
12405,Lynette,you think they're cool.
9969,Lynette,really?
17945,Susan,seriously?
13629,Susan,that's what happened with carl. i only dated him a couple of months. i filled in the blanks; i married him. it was a disaster!
14902,Susan,wow.
15920,Susan,"no! no, no! actually, i just, i just had something to tell you."
14056,Susan,"zach, um, julie is only fourteen years old, and sometimes girls, when they're that age they just don't always make the right decisions. and, um, as her mother, it is my responsibiliity to protect her."
15231,Susan,i still don't have insurance.i need to get that operation.i'm--i'm really screwed.
18096,Susan,"still, uh--i never meant to lead you on."
17765,Susan,"okay. well, have a nice day."
15544,Susan,"and you know why? because we're all so busy and detached from each other.you're at my house every day,and sure,we wave and we say hello,but we barely even know each other.how long have you been delivering my mail,for god's sake?"
15025,Susan,can't you just go home and have sex with your wife like a normal person?
13540,Susan,"um, i'm not really a fan."
13513,Susan,"well, she's bringing out the big guns."
13565,Susan,you'd better go get that.
16452,Susan,i don't wanna talk about it.
15051,Susan,really?
15530,Susan,i know that this looks bad--
14661,Susan,"edie, come back here! we're not finished yet!"
16292,Susan,"oh, no. no one's saying smaller. no, that's crazy talk. rock me."
13553,Susan,"and when i realised i couldn't put out the fire, i ran. i must have dropped the measuring jug in the process."
17059,Susan,okay.
17359,Susan,"well, i have to agree. she's changed. she's not that fun anymore."
15322,Susan,and he keeps telling me how special i am and how much i mean to him--how he wants to hold my beating heart in his hand.
13463,Susan,"honey, stay out of this."
14361,Susan,tim!
14833,Susan,"uh, he's my boyfriend, and, and he told me that paul confessed everything to him. oh, and mike has martha's journals, which clearly prove that paul had a motive."
16644,Susan,"she's so excited, so needy."
15731,Susan,here's a job. how about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist?
14276,Susan,mom!
15117,Susan,he's young.
15246,Susan,"well,i trusted you not to cheat on me and break my heart."
14405,Susan,"paul, hi."
15118,Susan,younger than me.
15919,Susan,"of course i came. oh! oh, i just love your house. it always smells like you. oh, my gosh! what, is the thing, is that tonight?"
15723,Susan,oh.all right.i'll see you tomorrow.
14188,Susan,"see? shifting blame onto someone else -- that's classic criminal behavior. oh, i'm telling you, he's up to no good."
18436,Susan,"actually tom could you just hang on a second. uh, i also would like to say a few words. to bree and orson, ah yes, what could be better than a second love, and this time you enter it a little older, a little wiser, but also, and this is key, uh, with a bit of caution. because, while love can be spontaneous and wonderful, it can also be selfish and sometimes the best thing you can do is just to walk away. uh, not you two. you two crazy kids are great. congrats, yeah."
14938,Susan,"oh. well, clearly i have more research to do. so, what do you think? my life story, would you rush out and buy a copy?"
16569,Susan,"well, then. we'll just be happy."
15759,Susan,and that's bad why?
17409,Susan,is it? i can't tell. ooh! excuse me.
13977,Susan,"what, you think there's a chance mrs. huber didn't write about it in the journal?"
16635,Susan,right. yeah.
13983,Susan,"i just wanted to see how you were holding up. you know, with mrs. huber and everything."
18034,Susan,"okay, you know what? let me show you something i think might change your mind. so katherine has a picture that i painted for mike hanging over her mantelpiece."
17390,Susan,so were you. oh. and--time to go.
14557,Susan,yeah.
13966,Susan,"well, if anyone can go the distance, he can. i should know."
14878,Susan,that's okay. people make-
17478,Susan,"ugh. hey. hon. how was the park? wait. hold on. mommy just found her first gray hair. i need you to grab it, yank it and never speak of it again. oh. look at your face. it's scratched. what happened?"
17237,Susan,"oh, no, that's okay. i'll be fine."
13657,Susan,i'm mad that i like you so much without knowing anything about you.
15338,Susan,"i did?oh, is that why you han't been in to see me since my surgery?"
15683,Susan,mike still hasn't seen the invitation.
14713,Susan,poor julie.
17401,Susan,"oh, you poor thing! you need a hug."
17777,Susan,"of course. why wouldn't it be okay? i think it's--great. really, really great."
17454,Susan,so you just happened to stumble across my secret turn-on the same night that you and mike became b.f.f.s?
15964,Susan,"excuse me, my name is susan mayer."
16647,Susan,no. i'm screwed. i cannot get out of this without hurting her feelings.
17753,Susan,"hey, do you wanna take a walk? i need a little girl free time."
14851,Susan,a knife. i just want to slice some tomatoes.
15520,Susan,thank you.thank you for having my back.
13592,Susan,actually i do have a question. do you have a second?
15998,Susan,"ah, cutting to the chase. i like it. i have a confession to make. this whole dating drama has been keeping me up at night, and i hate being the bi*chy, naggy mom. when it comes to parenting, i am much more comfortable playing the good cop. do you see where i'm going with this, kids?"
15748,Susan,dr. mayer?
16067,Susan,i wish. my cooking is not good.
16656,Susan,"see ya. oh, by the way--you know that one percent sliver of a doubt thing i told you about? totally gone. any question i had about mike's been answered."
16864,Susan,"bree? can we call a truce, please? so you know i'm not bluffing, um, i brought cake."
17780,Susan,"oh, don't forget his coat."
16497,Susan,"look, whatever that court report says, i do not have anger issues. i was just having a bad day."
13632,Susan,you couldn't get any more out of him?
16482,Susan,"yes. i don't need a man. i don't even need sex. i went without it the first sixteen years--twenty-two years of my life, and i can go a few more."
16980,Susan,"you know, i expected to meet a guy that was racked with remorse, and instead, i'm looking across the table at this--"
13872,Susan,"i cannot believe that after everything you did, you're mad at me."
13783,Susan,"what? oh, i can explain."
13797,Susan,are you okay?
14486,Susan,"and on a completely unrelated topic, mike and i are moving in together. see ya."
16075,Susan,oh?
14991,Susan,what? i just got here.
14440,Susan,i don't suppose she told you he was a drug dealer?
17832,Susan,yeah. sure. why not?
15187,Susan,"yeah, that."
14367,Susan,"mom! hold it! you are not getting in a car with those two, you hardly know them."
13681,Susan,"it hasn't really changed since girl scouts. girls smile at you to your face, and then behind your back, they make fun of you because you're the only one not shaving your legs yet."
16745,Susan,i'm pregnant?
13432,Susan,hey.
16859,Susan,edie. woman. blonde. bleach!
14645,Susan,"hi, matthew."
15852,Susan,what?
14789,Susan,"well, i just came over to give you the contract. your door was open."
15215,Susan,"i need health insurance,um, 'cause i've got this wandering spleen and--that sounds funny,""spleen wandering,"" but--actually, it's not funny 'cause it can bang into things--so i need health insurance,so i'm getting married tomorrow.and you probably think i'm crazy, right?"
15508,Susan,"well,i just wanna help.so how about that movie?"
14126,Susan,"no, no, of course not. i could never think you killed anybody, even i wasn't your alibi, which i am."
16747,Susan,"well,now i believe you."
17392,Susan,"well, good, then you shouldn't have any problem finding a place to sleep."
17284,Susan,"you know, i think, actually, i might have those dough hooks somewhere."
13631,Susan,i can't believe zach said that. what else did he tell you?
18158,Susan,a cup? are you sure that'll be enough?
13344,Susan,"well, i., i just was wondering, if, um, if there was any chance that, um, you would uh-- i just-- wanted to ask if--"
17567,Susan,"yeah, just until you can blink both eyes at the same time."
15046,Susan,yep.
15574,Susan,letter? what letter?
16836,Susan,"oh, well, we could schedule our appointments together and carpool. you know--pregnant gals on the road."
17496,Susan,well--a girl.
16735,Susan,"oh,my gosh. she's out of the clinic."
18062,Susan,the lady with the purple swear?
15727,Susan,it's okay with you if i go out with him?
18205,Susan,so--have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
15376,Susan,"ron,what are you doing?"
15890,Susan,"yeah, now. look, you gotta understand. the doctors were telling me that you would probably never wake up, and i just needed somebody to talk to.mike: and that's what you were doing in the country, talking?"
14273,Susan,"yeah, you really did. so let's go call the insurance company."
14170,Susan,i got to learn to keep my doors locked.
15819,Susan,"that we work hard, and we deserve to relax."
13884,Susan,"well, i can't talk to you about everything."
14160,Susan,well--i'm a little sad. mike and i were just a fling. and not even a full fling. sort of a borderline fling.
18422,Susan,what have you done?
16162,Susan,bree!
18186,Susan,"yeah, i left that casserole three days ago, and it's still there. i'm surprised the squirrels haven't gotten to it."
16894,Susan,i'm not seeing any nuts.
14063,Susan,"well, we've all been in their house. have you ever seen a picture of another kid there? i mean, why keep dana's baby blanket and throw out all the photos?"
16177,Susan,"don't change the subject. are you two having sex? because i thought that i raised you to be smarter than that. don't you realize that sex is not fun and games? it's dangerous. every time you turn around, there's a new disease. do you want it to burn when you pee?"
14639,Susan,"uh, betty? betty? oh, betty, can i ask you a question?"
13648,Susan,"oh,thank you so much! you're saving my life!!"
16360,Susan,you can count on it.
17704,Susan,aren't i?
17611,Susan,what?
14245,Susan,"okay, i won't go out with him. i mean obviously you have feeling for him."
16791,Susan,mm-hmm?
14693,Susan,"well, i don't mean to be technical here, but this show, i mean, it really is supposed to be a family thing, and i hate to point out you're not family."
14784,Susan,will you stop judging and help me?
15873,Susan,"girlfriend?! okay, you know what? i want marcy's number in honolulu, and i want it right now."
17860,Susan,"i know it's sudden, but i feel really good about this. and it's only two hours away, so it'll still be like we're practically next door."
16370,Susan,i can feel the car sinking. we're gonna have to get to shore.
14597,Susan,"obviously, um, it was quite a shock, but it's good news any way you slice it."
18136,Susan,"yeah. that's what everybody thinks. but the first time we met, it seemed like we'd end up being the best of friends."
16472,Susan,for ten years? it's crazy. has anybody talked to her?
15610,Susan,no!give it! no!
15168,Susan,"right, right.actually,i sort of meant, um--do you personally feel confident?"
14320,Susan,for shoving her.
16701,Susan,so our life together is exactly how you pictured it?you've gotten everything you wanted?
16354,Susan,mike. i saw you watching us. we were just talking.
13723,Susan,where did you say they were going tonight?
16126,Susan,i snuck into his office and rifled through his things.
14956,Susan,"well, why would my mother tell me that?"
16228,Susan,"um, no, actually, i'm a friend of ian's. he asked me to come--for jane."
13666,Susan,"i got to say, i was a little surprised to see mary alice's award for sale. she got it for doing charity work, from the chamber of commerce."
18389,Susan,m.j.! don't come out!
16771,Susan,"i'm sorry, honey. you wanted a decision. this is my decision."
18351,Susan,i know. and feel free to throw me out of your house if i'm out of line--but do you love her?
14482,Susan,"you know, i'm gonna run home and get some milk to go with those doughnuts."
14237,Susan,"well, see that's the thing, he doesn't think of himself as ""your bill"" cause he said that date was just a one time thing. which i know because when he asked me out, i told him i thought you guys were involved."
16893,Susan,"gee, let me think. nope, no nuts."
14779,Susan,really? so that's it with you. you just get one shot and you screw up and you're out. i didn't know you were such a cynic.
17663,Susan,the sex music. turn it off.
17255,Susan,just bananas.
14106,Susan,"i'm saying that is about as likely as mike having done it. he's a good guy. i know him. i mean, he's, he's mike."
15776,Susan,"no, i'm good."
15086,Susan,"oh, my god!"
18258,Susan,finish what?
17897,Susan,"oh, thank god! we've been locked in here all night."
14821,Susan,"he's right, mom. oh, i want it to be just like you do. you know on your own terms and you get down on one knee and the whole production."
14838,Susan,i'm sorry. i've been waiting for you. i'm just a little upset because everybody thinks i'm crazy.
13856,Susan,mike.
16876,Susan,"hey, neighbor!"
17338,Susan,you're right. my son's future is at stake. i have to do something.
14084,Susan,"here's the thing, i don't think i'm ready to have another baby. i think we need to have a serious conversation."
16316,Susan,"um, guys? don't worry. she's all right."
16523,Susan,"i am. i'm gonna marry ian. believe me, this wasn't easy, especially when you started to remember how it was between us. maybe if the timing had been different--"
16543,Susan,"okay, carlos--tell me where to find him."
15469,Susan,"no,don't bother,'cause i'm going."
13940,Susan,what?
16131,Susan,down to the jailhouse to talk to mike.
18341,Susan,are you insane? why would you do something--
15179,Susan,"i've been waiting for three hours.after you stormed out the other night,i started to doubt myself.i started to think,""gee, you know, maybe i should just ignore my better instincts,and i should let dr. ron gut me like a fish."""
14830,Susan,"no, stop! put that pie filling down. slowly. i'm calling nine-one-one."
17631,Susan,i wanted to talk about our future.
17996,Susan,no.
13978,Susan,are you high? edie hates me.
15795,Susan,why not? i think that's adorable.
18199,Susan,yeah. look what it did to us.
14526,Susan,great. that's great.
16153,Susan,so alma's alive. big deal. we still don't know what went down between orson and monique.
14655,Susan,"okay, karl asked me to get back together the day after julie's birthday. i said no, which i'm guessing is the reason for the now legendary tequila bra-popping incident. please let go."
15718,Susan,"yes, you did."
16348,Susan,"and you brought it to bed? okay, romance tip number one--"
15724,Susan,i love you.it is really just dinner.
15057,Susan,"right, interesting."
14822,Susan,well. then i can wait. i can wait. i'm a good waiter.
17017,Susan,"well, if you did, you wouldn't be doing this! i mean, my god, mike, we have a baby on the way!"
15121,Susan,"oh,well,maybe i should go ahead and see him anyway,just to be safe."
14137,Susan,"yes, on valentine's day."
13795,Susan,i hope the kids aren't too much for danielle to handle.
18001,Susan,i don't need the details. i had a long day. i just want to pick up my kid.
18383,Susan,keys. keys--
13506,Susan,i think we should show paul the note.
14641,Susan,"well, uh, i work at home, so i'm home a lot working. and i just keep hearing these noises lately. uh, it's hard to concentrate."
13575,Susan,no! it's not like that.
17039,Susan,"oh, barrett, i wasn't fishing for compliments. if i was--i would've shown you this one."
13814,Susan,"you're sleeping with him, aren't you?"
13571,Susan,you are so sweet. i would love to go.
14374,Susan,will you stop acting like tonight was all about helping me? you wanted to go out and have fun and lamont needed a date.
14298,Susan,ante up.
13867,Susan,"he's right. sorry, guys!"
15084,Susan,"we don't hate you, zach.you had an incredibly hard year.and you shouldn't have done what you did,but we just wanna help you move on."
16008,Susan,what? no! i don't take orders from you!
14372,Susan,"tim, can you just stay out of this?"
13640,Susan,and that means what?
15370,Susan,"please,please let me explain."
15521,Susan,so do i have to worry about you attacking any more waitresses?
15275,Susan,"how? how are you gonna handle edie?that poor woman's dreams exploded in her face tonight.you know,it's not like you can just go out and buy her flowers,and everything will be better."
15766,Susan,"hi, edie. nice party, huh?"
18393,Susan,"well, you won't get away with it. mike already called the cops. they're on their way."
15691,Susan,"i know.but if you really do-- love me, you'll let me go."
14726,Susan,i can be naked in twenty seconds! that includes travel time.
14253,Susan,"oh, god, no. no! you are just so incredibly not hideous."
18189,Susan,hot shirtless gardeners with great abs and learner's permits?
14533,Susan,i'm just gonna go get some water.
17301,Susan,aah! aah! come on. aah! aah! aah!
16794,Susan,what?
17715,Susan,"uh, no. no. no, no. no! no, no, no! oh, all right! but no matter what he asks you, promise me you'll say ""no."""
15829,Susan,"oh, ian, i just took a week off. i couldn't possibly justify taking another."
15276,Susan,"well,that's a little extreme."
15999,Susan,"well, in that case. meet the bad cop."
15496,Susan,what's going on?
16195,Susan,you got my daughter the pill?!
18305,Susan,and unbelievably generous. i'm gonna send him a thank-you right now.
14980,Susan,"yeah. they're just like mine. they're, they're nice."
15473,Susan,i don't think so.so i think you should probably stay with edie.and the band is good.you should hire 'em.
14668,Susan,are you in love with her?
13686,Susan,"i don't know, julie. you pretend to be bulimic. gag a little. come on, work with me here!"
15056,Susan,"i like 'em, very nice."
15267,Susan,"oh,no,edie--"
15898,Susan,how do you sleep at night?
15974,Susan,you're going back to modeling?
14317,Susan,"hey, millie, hi, morty."
17712,Susan,"oh, reminds me of being young and single. oh, i wish i'd never given up that."
14812,Susan,what did he do?
15335,Susan,i love mike
13542,Susan,will you please just drop it?
18408,Susan,shhhh.keep playing.
17816,Susan,no. i'm good.
15599,Susan,"okay, what are you talking about?"
18081,Susan,"i don't have cumin, but i probably have cinnamon."
16908,Susan,oh. it's just a baby shower--that i'm throwing-- for my best friend.
14045,Susan,everything.
16971,Susan,"uh, no. thank you, nick."
15707,Susan,"ha, still i--"
15455,Susan,"mike,hi! what a surprise."
14553,Susan,"yeah, he's crazy!"
15323,Susan,"mmm.maybe it's because i just haven't felt that thunderbolt yet.you know,with mike,it hit me.with karl,it hit me.i didn't have to worry about how i felt because the thunderbolt told me."
18026,Susan,"washed, cleaned, ready to go."
17802,Susan,"okay. it-it's a little uncomfortable, is whole situation. i mean, if m.j.'s picking up on it, how am i supposed to fix that?"
17479,Susan,and your shirt is ripped. that's the second time this week. is someone picking on you? who is it?
18238,Susan,my ex-husband.
17786,Susan,that's the worst thing i've ever heard.
14507,Susan,"okay, next time i won't bring my daughter to stalk my boyfriend. it was a slight error in judgment. honey, please don't give me the silent treatment."
17989,Susan,"oh, hey, baby. how's my boy? i missed you so much. are you feeling better?"
14076,Susan,are you okay?
15478,Susan,karl--you look pretty beat up.why--why don't you--why don't you come in and--we'll crack open a bottle of wine.come on.
17974,Susan,"no. but i read in your brochure that faculty members get a 50% discount, so for your art department, how would you like to hire an award-winning children's book illustrator who is great with kids and has a face you can't say no to?"
17210,Susan,really? not even when you heard an acoustic guitar?
13683,Susan,pull up a chair.
15170,Susan,"okay, red flag! see, i didn't go to medical school,but i'm thinking--not all the same."
16921,Susan,"i know. uh, maybe if i"
16357,Susan,"i'd like you to say, ""we don't need this. we trust you."" but you don't, so i'll sign it. and once i do, i am going to earn your trust by being a good wife to ian."
15523,Susan,where'd all this food come from?
16643,Susan,"hey, how about a double wedding?"
17351,Susan,because my husband is terrified of balloons. he was once molested by a clown.
18248,Susan,"oh, uh, right. jackson, you remember mrs. mccluskey, don't you?"
16798,Susan,"oh, that must mean you're matt. i'm susan mayer, and i'm--"
17281,Susan,"he told you that? well, we're getting past it."
15363,Susan,"karl!oh, god!"
15710,Susan,so you asked us to a meal to announce another meal?that's so bree of you.
13462,Susan,no.
14743,Susan,"what do you think, bree?"
16590,Susan,there. i think i left messages for everyone. are you sure it's okay for us to have the same wedding i was planning with ian? be honest.
16311,Susan,i'm so sorry.
15730,Susan,then why the rush?
16598,Susan,"yep! i promised people a wedding, and they are getting one."
16563,Susan,"no, seriously, i was asking. what would you have done?"
17081,Susan,forget it.
16901,Susan,"leave him with me. i need to score some points with those guys, and being a dog-rescuing hero could be just the ticket."
13980,Susan,"boy, i gotta say, i envy you."
17855,Susan,i'm not good alone. i need a man in my life.
13551,Susan,"julie? julie ,honey, wake up. we need to talk.."
14090,Susan,mike?!
13849,Susan,"i just, i just want it to be special."
14622,Susan,"no! i have not even begun ripping into edie britt yet. oh, that peroxide vulture! i just know as sure as i am standing here that she went after your father just to tick me off."
17252,Susan,i'm not asking you to lie. i'm just saying spin. why won't you spin?
13718,Susan,paul young's garage sale.
17114,Susan,and our oven is making its debut.
14018,Susan,what is he talking about? what's happening on friday?
14147,Susan,"stop! stop mike, just stop. if you keep talking, you're gonna work your way into my heart and i just don't want you anywhere near my heart. ever."
16334,Susan,"okay, stop this. we invited you here to celebrate our engagement. now i'm divorced, and ian's disinherited?"
15885,Susan,"okay,i know it's hard, but you gotta make an effort,and, you know, if your head is a little foggy, then don't look there. look in your heart, because i'm in there, just like you're inside mine. okay, um, this is mary alice's house, and this is where we first met. i was setting out my macaroni and cheese, and you were invited--oh! ow!"
14663,Susan,"oh, my god. i'm so sorry. i sent roses. did she get the roses?"
16426,Susan,kiss me.
15882,Susan,"and when i locked myself out of the house, that's where the bush was that you found me in. naked. surely you remember that."
17037,Susan,"gosh, you're studying to be a doctor. that must not leave you a lot of free time for hobbies or--a girlfriend."
15975,Susan,"we are. we're just gonna miss you, that's all."
17318,Susan,"oh, i know you do. i don't, and neither does the baby. philip? oh, phil? see? nothing. not even a burp. here's a thought. how about ""nathaniel""?"
16295,Susan,"no, it's okay. i can get it resized."
13712,Susan,could you give it a shot?
16148,Susan,"oh, uh--sure."
16907,Susan,"oh. well, would you like me to help you look for him?"
17189,Susan,"orson, you were naked in this kitchen last night."
17942,Susan,"well, you wouldn't have to worry about that with m.j.. he's so well-behaved."
15838,Susan,can't you do that stuff later?
14115,Susan,"well, i'm adorable crazy, and he's rampage crazy."
15726,Susan,he sort of asked me out.
16328,Susan,hello!
17030,Susan,"if the cover has holes in it, the book is no good."
15546,Susan,"well,you probably wanna use the bathroom before you leave,huh?"
14771,Susan,"well, i don't hate you. i couldn't hate you. you're my lonnie."
14334,Susan,"you don't have to sell me. go, just go talk to her. now."
13765,Susan,i never get out of the house.
13643,Susan,i know who you are. you're a carl in disguise. i'm done with you: all of you.
16375,Susan,"if you stay here, you'll definitely drown. you see how my plan is better?"
15270,Susan,where's edie?
13840,Susan,"julie, in the letters, did zach say anything about running away?"
15896,Susan,no! you--you--mike? you don't even want him! you're just doing this to hurt me.
17706,Susan,"you're right. i'll stay out of it. oh, now where is the little girls' room?"
13974,Susan,that's good to hear.
14348,Susan,argh!
15823,Susan,what? what were you gonna say?
14592,Susan,how long have you known?
13823,Susan,exactly. you are not mature enough to have a realistic perspective on this relationship. you would be so much happier with a girl your own age.
14782,Susan,"yes, and i gave him money and i sent him away and i didn't tell mike."
18284,Susan,yeah. he was on board when he found out there was cake.
17502,Susan,never mind. what did you do to m.j.?
15699,Susan,"oh.well, how long until you can do another one?"
17012,Susan,"and he needed something for the pain, so he happened to find the last two pills in the medicine cabinet, and he took 'em. it's no big deal."
15274,Susan,karl--
14587,Susan,"oh, my god."
15631,Susan,"susan mayer.thank you so much.if my husband had to rescue me, i just, i would have never heard the end of it.he thinks i'm a total klutz."
14281,Susan,i know.
17676,Susan,"okay, i just ran into your house half-naked. the only thing you should be doing is me. what is on your face? is that paint? are you painting again?"
14479,Susan,"how sweet, thanks. why don't you go put these on a plate? oh, and save me one with sprinkles."
17986,Susan,"i gotta go. you get lots of rest and drink plenty of fluids, okay?"
17220,Susan,you just don't want to be crushed under the weight of a repulsive cow.
14069,Susan,"oh, poor lynette. she doesn't get a new nanny soon, she's gonna implode."
18086,Susan,"well, that's because--"
17309,Susan,"well, it happens."
13523,Susan,i love old movies!!
13989,Susan,"okay. look, uh, i, i just haven't always treated you well, and i want to make amends."
18050,Susan,"it is, actually, because that is when i decided that i don't want this piece of art that i slaved over hanging in the house you are sharing with your new girlfriend. capisce?"
13976,Susan,everything about the fire and the measuring cup is gonna be in that journal. everyone is gonna think i'm an arsonist.
15104,Susan,"oh,sorry."
15346,Susan,sure.
14011,Susan,"well, edie, i, i have to clean up."
13496,Susan,"okay, you have got to know that i only get that angry around karl. he just treated me so badly at the end, i-i haven't been able to get past it."
15968,Susan,"this is susan mayer-- again. first of all, i'm sorry for the ""crazy lady"" remark. second, i have a proposition for you."
15966,Susan,"okay, you don't have to be nasty. my daughter is inside there."
17666,Susan,"you know, that was hard for me to share, and the fact that you just make light of it--no, i'm am calling the second date officially over. and you know what? i was going to let you feel me up over my blouse. but now? nada."
15344,Susan,"okay, you know what?you should come over to dinner and meet karl,that there is absolutely nothing between us."
15524,Susan,hi. i got your message.what's up?
15961,Susan,"excuse me, what's going-- what's going on?"
14701,Susan,i'm busy now.
15320,Susan,because he's a gem.and apparently he loves me.
14324,Susan,"that's okay, that's okay."
17481,Susan,okay. we'll give him a call.
13481,Susan,"no, you're the one who's been humiliating yourself, karl, why don't you see that? you walked out on your family. people think you're scum, not me. so worry about yourself, i'm okay with me. i can walk down the street and walk my head high."
14032,Susan,"so if you had a problem, or some sort of secret was weighing on you--"
17194,Susan,"oh, my god. you thought i was crazy, but it wasn't a dream. you're naked! and that means you're crazy."
17159,Susan,"hey, uh, tim, i've got mike here. do you want to talk to him?"
13837,Susan,what did you expect-a hug?
15288,Susan,then i'm on board.
16187,Susan,you are gonna make a really good mother someday.
14449,Susan,"i can't trust mike, and i wanted to find out what really happened. from a source that doesn't have an agenda. now open it up."
16939,Susan,"this is awkward. uh, i told katherine i'd vote for her."
15418,Susan,"he's right.we behaved like children--naughty,stupid children."
15171,Susan,i would like to.but i gotta be honest--the fact that you can't even cut that steak isn't helping.
15845,Susan,"ian, i'm, i'm sorry. i know how you feel. it's mike. it's my mike."
17041,Susan,look what i found on the dryer. julie won second place in the state science fair.
16855,Susan,"a whole concept, person, um, let's see. shakespeare, book, and then if you do the signal for book. and you touch your heart, then that's poem."
15849,Susan,"yes! yes, i have. almost every day. i can't tell you how much i'm kicking myself for not being here when you woke up."
15018,Susan,"actually, it was--fine."
17881,Susan,this is not proof of anything.
14020,Susan,"don't tell me to chill, i have no intentions of chilling."
15949,Susan,"hello? yes, this is her mother. what?"
17576,Susan,"well, just please change your shirt."
17015,Susan,"i'm thinking that you're a drug addict and a liar, so say something that's not that."
17892,Susan,"all these years, i have judged you, and--it is not your fault. oh, come here. you are the way you are because of your father."
14691,Susan,"hi. i'm sorry to interrupt. i knocked, but i guess you guys didn't hear me."
17858,Susan,"well, maybe i can help you. think you can rent my house out?"
17872,Susan,what are you getting at?
13864,Susan,no. my clothes were already off. i was going to seduce you.
14992,Susan,charming.
14350,Susan,"um, mom. could i just talk to you in the family room for a minute?"
14356,Susan,"mom, i don't hate you."
16424,Susan,"well, let's not bother him tonight. you know, i don't really even need a flashlight. my eyes have totally adjusted to the dark."
16764,Susan,what? i'm eating for two.
15414,Susan,"well,i should go."
13569,Susan,distant? what do you mean?
13615,Susan,good.i just came by to say hello.
13721,Susan,you don't know what you are talking about. they're just friends.
17038,Susan,"well, no rush. you know, just yesterday, i was telling my daughter julie--oh, you know, that is so rude. i-i'm talking about daughter, and you don't even know what she looks like. that's her."
14649,Susan,"well, etiquette is a lost art for a lot of people."
16504,Susan,how we doing on time?
16941,Susan,"okay. if i vote for you, do you promise to get rid of that fountain?"
14724,Susan,good night.
17089,Susan,"mike, stop!"
13886,Susan,"oh, yeah."
17205,Susan,yes. thanks.
17376,Susan,"here's the thing. you and i have always had kind of an unconventional relationship, and the reason that worked was because we always tell each other the truth--until yesterday. julie, i lied about not having enough money to send you."
16740,Susan,i'm in here.
13509,Susan,i'm trying a new strategy. i'm playing hard to get.
18267,Susan,"this--i mean, this is really the only thing you can do to stay here and do your work?"
18082,Susan,thanks. i was thinking about the other night--
13958,Susan,"mike, guess what? i love you!"
17993,Susan,yeah. come on in.
14410,Susan,"although if you wouldn't mind, i'm really like to see that video tape i found, the one marked ""angela"". it'd be nice to see mary alice when she was young."
14555,Susan,"okay, that's because i was wrestling it away from zach so that he wouldn't shoot you."
14780,Susan,"julie, i did something bad. something really, really bad. aren't you gonna ask me what it was?"
15094,Susan,are you jim?i'm susan mayer.
14270,Susan,hey mom.
18421,Susan,"if he's not gone in five minutes, then i'm going to go out there and tell him how old you really are."
17774,Susan,"uh--no, thanks. i'm really busy. i have a lot of things to do today. another time though, okay? bye."
14559,Susan,ow! that hurts.
17452,Susan,"yeah. but how did you know i would like it? oh, my god."
15377,Susan,"oh,my god!guys,stop it.stop it,right now!"
14949,Susan,"mom, don't walk away from me."
13705,Susan,"okay, you can leave now."
16546,Susan,"okay, julie, i'm out of here. here's forty bucks on the counter."
14943,Susan,"oh, well, yeah, i thought you probably did. so i checked that, too, and he wasn't there and so i called the v.a., and there is not a single record of anyone named harrison ross in vietnam."
16014,Susan,relationships have nothing to do with good judgment. it doesn't matter how smart you are. you can still get hurt. you do your homework. i'm gonna finish the laundry. okay.
17109,Susan,"oh, yeah. every cup needs a coaster. every coaster needs a doily. every doily needs daily laundering. this woman is gonna drive me out of my freakin' hey, roomies. you need help?"
15498,Susan,really?did he say who it was?
16987,Susan,"because i am carrying a baby that has your genes. if my doctor told me that there was something wrong with this baby--something physical, i could handle that. i would probably even love it more. but if my baby was born without a conscience, without a soul, i don't know what i would do."
15820,Susan,"uh, fresh air is good for us?"
18318,Susan,"dave, i haven't heard jackson since he was taken away and i just wanna be here in case he calls."
13997,Susan,"well, it's, it's really no, no big deal."
13579,Susan,"good evening, mrs huber."
16805,Susan,"well, believe it. we're going. you, too, dylan. come on."
18035,Susan,"yes, and we talked all about it. she loves it."
17806,Susan,"i know. you know, that colts jersey you bought him doesn't fit anymore."
15594,Susan,are you-- okay?
13910,Susan,what?
17428,Susan,it's not really a good time.
16325,Susan,i set your mother on fire.
18334,Susan,hey. i need to talk to mike.
16358,Susan,"i mean it. i am going to be loving and faithful and above all, honest. there'll be no secrets with ian. i'll tell him everything."
14727,Susan,"oh, sorry. i'm helping mike find zach. you know, so we can all rest easy at night."
18067,Susan,look at you. you're like that schoolmarm in the movies who lets down her hair and va-va-va-voom.
15933,Susan,"a little of both, so, boozan."
17823,Susan,come on.
17477,Susan,get out.
17948,Susan,fantastic.
14271,Susan,what happened?
15883,Susan,"ouch, that hurts.um, okay, remember this spot?this is where we sat in your truck and had our first kiss."
13401,Susan,"edie, would you like to join us for dinner?"
15704,Susan,"oh, hey, you weren't supposed to see that."
15560,Susan,yes?
18364,Susan,"oh, sweetie. you just had one, and we don't want to have to stop ten times so you can go to the bathroom."
14299,Susan,the rules are simple. we play for cash. the dealer picks the game and unsubstantiated gossip is encouraged.
14801,Susan,i do.
13900,Susan,here you are.
13926,Susan,"okay, have fun."
17686,Susan,"oh, not yet. i wanna give her new boyfriend the once-over. wow. he's as cute as she said-- nice smile, and look at that hair. don't you just wanna run your fingers through it?"
16871,Susan,"it's just gonna get worse. do you know, when our babies go to college, we'll be like--"
14132,Susan,are you sure?
14976,Susan,"i know. but i gotta find out if there's something there. i've always wanted a dad. i mean, i know not having one affected me."
13612,Susan,"now that you've gotten your date, can you tell me what that really mean -that 907a?"
17476,Susan,"can you leave, please?"
18370,Susan,this sounds really---
13404,Susan,right.
16617,Susan,excuse me?
15847,Susan,"oh, my god. you are awake."
14846,Susan,"oh! oh! uh, uh, paul, you, you can't just waltz into people's houses."
15993,Susan,"are you crazy?! if we don't do something, those two could end up having sex!"
18206,Susan,you're kidding. so soon?
17908,Susan,do what?
17940,Susan,so i heard through the grapevine that there might be an opening for another student?
17890,Susan,"oh, my god."
16134,Susan,"oh, well, you know, we'll figure that out later."
16943,Susan,"well, we need our sleep."
15143,Susan,what about your girlfriend?
16619,Susan,"i cannot believe that you just said that. okay, you know what? i came over here to give you my response card. but here. this is my response."
17370,Susan,hey.
15083,Susan,you okay?
13737,Susan,"oh, yeah, i'm here to ride the bull. check it out! okay! yeah! woo! baby! woo!"
14346,Susan,you just broke up with morty two weeks ago. don't you think you could at least pretend to mourn the relationship.
18392,Susan,"dave, please--i'm so sorry about that accident. you don't wanna hurt m.j. or me. you're a good person. i know you."
14692,Susan,"well, i have good news. um, i've been taking piano lessons with betty applewhite, and, uh, well, i just thought maybe i could join you guys. you know, like a trio. doesn't that sound fun?"
16159,Susan,we do. can we talk about this later?
13449,Susan,how could we have all forgotten about this?
13914,Susan,good.
14390,Susan,i'll talk to you girls later.
17482,Susan,"well, what did he say?"
13454,Susan,i have an idea.
14538,Susan,just get the hell out of here.
15254,Susan,great!i'll have a light lunch.
16664,Susan,i'm thinking a chocolate fountain would be a cool centerpiece to a dessert buffet.
13851,Susan,"perfumes and oils. and i want to pick out the outfit that you are going to tear off me. and plus, i need to be in complete control of the lighting."
17779,Susan,"well, she and your daddy are friends, and the more, the merrier."
18162,Susan,"okay, well, since you're on this moral roll, why don't we walk over to helen's? and i will introduce you. we can have some tea, and then you two could swap stories about ed's favorite positions."
13873,Susan,"yeah, well, someone had to be responsible, and like it or not, i've got a birth certificate that says i'm your mother."
18172,Susan,good. we got some ground to make up. i was hoping we would be able to get there before dark.
15950,Susan,you told me you weren't even friends with him. now you're shoplifting together?
14769,Susan,who else is using that word?
16156,Susan,"well,obviously,you weren't going to.they needed to know that that dead woman was orson's mistress."
14857,Susan,"he was talking so much about julie. i tried to get him to come home with me, i mean, to, to you, but he just kept going on and on about her, and i got scared."
13556,Susan,"ok, let's run through it one more time."
16259,Susan,"i'm not at liberty to say. under the circumstances, they'd prefer to keep it quiet. i don't believe it. if there was some bimbo in the picture, i'd have heard about it."
18115,Susan,it's not my fault. i showed this to the school psychologist. she gave it to the principal. my hands were tied.
13719,Susan,"i just wanted to say goodbye to mary alice's house, before somebody else moved in."
14049,Susan,so you and mary alice just kept this to yourselves all these years?
15875,Susan,"no, what are you-- oh, this is ridiculous! i mean, who am i disturbing? it's a coma ward! don't you want them to wake up?!"
17138,Susan,i told them you weren't into jam.
14119,Susan,"oh. oh, my god, yes. yes, yes, i was with mike that night."
15339,Susan,i don't even know a mike.
15981,Susan,"wait, wait, wait, wait! are you kidding?! that's lobster! okay, i thought the restaurant was fantastic, and you were the fussy snob who was impossible to please."
14095,Susan,yeah. i'm gonna go outside and let you rest for a while.
13944,Susan,"what is it? i'm really, really busy."
17384,Susan,"come here, come here."
13497,Susan,what do you mean?
14195,Susan,"no, something happened in this house, something so awful we can't even imagine it."
15178,Susan,we need to talk.
15616,Susan,"okay, edie,i'm in trouble here."
16227,Susan,the hospital?
16583,Susan,i thought you were gonna propose tonight.
16537,Susan,moved? what do you mean?
15538,Susan,who is it?
15208,Susan,why would you need a fake bride?
13844,Susan,"what are you, storing up for winter?"
18139,Susan,you're right. i'm homeless. susan mayer. oh. it's all cleared up.
17939,Susan,"thank you for agreeing to see us, mr. hobson. running a school like oakridge mustn't leave you with much--free time."
15562,Susan,"oh, thanks. no, that's okay.we'll stay at a motel."
13637,Susan,so when does our official date begin?
14217,Susan,i haven't read it.
17373,Susan,"well, i'm sure she's just upset, and she'll come home after she cools off."
17510,Susan,"you know what? we've both been incredibly childish here, and it is time one of us took the high road, so i am now going to walk away. please take note of this conflict resolution and try to pass the lesson on to your daughter."
17161,Susan,really? cause it sounded like a girl.
16634,Susan,it's one of those hard jelly ones. do you think that's an omen?
14886,Susan,why not?
14072,Susan,"he wants to have kids, and he had that look that men get that says 'i'm ready to procreate, point me to the nearest cervix'."
16473,Susan,"oh, i saw the curtain move. i think i saw a hand."
18266,Susan,"i don't. this isn't about you. not really. and besides, you moved on."
14238,Susan,"no. no, i wanted to check with you first."
14490,Susan,"oh. really? well ,that was easy. maybe after lunch we can talk about your leather bean bag chair."
14354,Susan,i've been plenty supportive.
15932,Susan,"oh, i didn't say that."
17878,Susan,this is a stupid exercise. i refuse to--
13418,Susan,i'm gonna keep my one little bag and go home.
15728,Susan,"well, i think a ten-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it."
16437,Susan,"oh, no, no, no. no, i'm not pregnant. no, i just know know what i want, which is ian. so i'm just eager to you know, no- not get it over with, per se, but just to get to the good part, which is the marriage to ian."
18369,Susan,"uh, yeah. we are in the car, singing."
15665,Susan,"hey, it's susan.just wanted you to know i let the electrician in your house.i hope you're having a great time at the spa."
15732,Susan,his wife vanished and he didn't even tell bree. how much more proof do you need?
17635,Susan,"yeah, i have been married twice, and both times that's imploded, so really, i feel like--love is not my friend. you know, i-i wish that i could say it was just rotten luck, but--i just am thinking that--i can't do this."
14527,Susan,"okay. hurry, though. i just have a feeling that paul young is in the middle of all of this."
16775,Susan,so back to chemo--how's that been?
16555,Susan,"two days? well, can't i just drive part of the way and then hike from there?"
14416,Susan,but you know what they say about kids: that you can't imagine having them until you do and then you can't imagine life without them? it's true.
16991,Susan,"well, you're wrong. he's happy. he's got a good job and a wife who loves him and a baby on the way."
13703,Susan,oh my god. we are so not having this conversation.
13412,Susan,why she did it. oh! let me help you.
13498,Susan,"listen, mike, i-about the whole seeing me naked thing. i don't know, i just, i wanna thank you for being such a-perfect gentleman."
17608,Susan,do i you think she'll be surprised?
15862,Susan,"okay, mike, i-i am not doing this to upset you. i'm doing this to help."
14392,Susan,who told you that?
14596,Susan,"i know how much you've always wanted a child, and now you have one."
16724,Susan,"oh,so you just shun them and throw them away."
16432,Susan,"mike, i am marrying ian. we have hired a caterer. we are going with the salmon, so just back off!"
16115,Susan,"i said i was sorry, ian. i have to help mike. i'm all he's got."
16083,Susan,what? why?
17926,Susan,thanks.
17346,Susan,griselda--that must have been a tough name to take out on the playground.
15645,Susan,wow.
17141,Susan,"i so appreciate you helping us out. mike would be doing our taxes, but he's off--"
14097,Susan,what's wrong?
16406,Susan,what?
15956,Susan,you have a lot of meetings anyway. we'll go some other time. i can't leave julie right now.
14233,Susan,i do. i really do.
15404,Susan,"oh. no,edie,wait.um,no,it's just that--you know,i was married to karl,and i used to--try to surprise him,and he would always,always,always say--""no,susan. don't surprise me.i don't like it."""
17620,Susan,"not so much. frank, how can i call him? he's the one that ended it with me."
18323,Susan,hello?
17075,Susan,"fine. but you know, if i find out that you have given mike so much as a breath mint, trust me, there is not enough novocaine in this office to numb the pain i will inflict on you."
14145,Susan,"it went just peachy, and humiliating, and shocking."
13558,Susan,"hey, that's right."
13391,Susan,"yeah, it's sort of a new tradition. i'm working out the kinks."
15211,Susan,"oh. oh,so by marrying me--"
16317,Susan,"dahlia, i am so sorry about the--"
16350,Susan,huh?
18225,Susan,i'm sorry. it's just-- the things you said--i'm worried about you.
14279,Susan,yes! mike served time for selling drugs and manslaughter
16280,Susan,of course. i should let you rest.
18040,Susan,"yeah, that's what she told me, too, only, uh, it didn't."
15397,Susan,no! i'm fine.the doctor said i should actually keep my blood flowing.
16783,Susan,"no, and neither are you."
14749,Susan,"i don't know. he, he disappeared."
15802,Susan,nine lovers is not a lot! nine lovers does not make me a slut!
16389,Susan,all right. we won't talk about it. want some cheese?
16122,Susan,i am not playing with a woman that is willing to let mike take the fall for her psycho husband.
17544,Susan,i had to tell you not to steal a father's precious moment.
16536,Susan,"no. uh, what about him?"
18256,Susan,i'm fine. i just didn't want you to see me crying.
18132,Susan,here's a thought. why don't we talk about edie?
15034,Susan,"hello, edie. do you have something you'd like to say?"
17577,Susan,fine. you can have a little space in the closet. i think i've got some clothes from the '80s i'm ready to part with.
14717,Susan,"what, that's it?"
14295,Susan,"alright, alright."
14205,Susan,we're broken up. i thought i made that pretty clear.
15133,Susan,okay.thank you.i'd like to get out now.
17734,Susan,how you feeling? i just gave blood.
16689,Susan,"well, i don't know if you've noticed, but my idea of the perfect wedding keeps changing. one day, i want white roses, and then i want lilies, and first, i want a harpist, and then a string quartet. only one thing stays constant--and i'm looking at him. why would i need anything else to make my wedding perfect?"
13932,Susan,you want to hear me sing?
13554,Susan,obviously i can't let her get away with this. the only thing to do is to go to the police and tell them everything that happened.
15635,Susan,"okay, now i know it's a little more cramped than we're used to, but we can't stay at bree's forever.she's gonna be coming back from that spa vacation soon.besides, it's gonna be fun."
18252,Susan,i'll see you tomorrow.
16759,Susan,"oh, whoa. no, hang on. let me just run and get julie so she can say good-bye to dylan."
14624,Susan,you lie.
16965,Susan,i don't care what the issues are. you don't deny your own dad's existence.
17698,Susan,"yeah. only twice. two. small number. much smaller than three. and my first cheated on me, so that doesn't even count."
15837,Susan,we should've been on the road ten minutes ago.
17799,Susan,what? i don't do that.
16417,Susan,ow! damn! thumbtack!
14582,Susan,"mike, he wanted to kill you."
13994,Susan,are you okay?
17579,Susan,"so obviously, this is the bedroom."
13698,Susan,he's at a rehabilitation center. julie snuck in and actually talked to him.
13641,Susan,so why couldn't you just tell me that?
14166,Susan,or just come on in.
15632,Susan,"oh, wow! i have a neighbor who just asked me over for coffee.i'm sorry.you must think i'm a lunatic."
15184,Susan,and i am so sorry about that-- snap thing.i was just trying to be theatrical.
17315,Susan,"no, i'm not trying to-- aah!"
14488,Susan,"when i was packing up your stuff in your bedroom, i found a box of bullets."
14783,Susan,i don't know. what would you do if this happened to you?
14088,Susan,what?
15373,Susan,i'm fine!
16789,Susan,mike!
14638,Susan,"mmm, brunch. brunch would be nice."
16542,Susan,"okay, look, i know that i've put mike through the wringer, but that's why i have to talk to him--to make it right. he's not answering his cell phone."
14935,Susan,"well, i've been writing a book. it's sort of autobiographical. really been forcing me to reexamine some of the different things that have made me me, like the fact that my mother had me so young, and i never knew my dad. big stuff like that. i told you about my dad, right? he was a merchant marine, and his platoon was killed in the battle of hanoi?"
16483,Susan,what?
17104,Susan,what do you suggest we do?
13825,Susan,really? i look okay?
17028,Susan,i checked out his web page.
18175,Susan,"and your mom's new husband's never met you, so he thought it would be best if we told you."
17511,Susan,i came to say i'm sorry.
17449,Susan,potato skins at o'brien's? you've made his inner circle! this is fantastic! thank you. mmm. mmm.
14158,Susan,hi.
13660,Susan,favourite band?
13427,Susan,"no, julie, she wasn't married to xavier. that was just one of her special friends. i think we should change the subject, you know, unless you wanna keep talking about it."
14255,Susan,"okay, i'll go out with you."
15971,Susan,"thank you. i'm sure lynette's gonna be fine, too."
17983,Susan,"so do i, and it's my first day at a new job. i win."
16052,Susan,but--
17990,Susan,that's cute. where's mike?
18423,Susan,"for god's sake, tim, she's ticklish! how many times do you have to be told?"
17924,Susan,"i-i-if karl's coming--change the locks, then leave."
15905,Susan,you have--
15666,Susan,careful with those.the last of the crystal.okay.
13841,Susan,there's your answer.
16420,Susan,mike?
14236,Susan,um. bill asked me out.
13646,Susan,"oh!uh, yes, and a lovely corner it is too. i hate to bother you while you're working but i was just wondering if you could point me in the direction of a pay phone. oh, and if you had some change for this five , preferably quarters?."
18289,Susan,"uh, can i talk to you for a sec?"
18349,Susan,"yeah. that and, uh--i don't know. it d-did kind of come out of nowhere."
14296,Susan,"oh, come on!"
15615,Susan,"okay, i'm just gonna think that this is the meds talking,and i'll come back tomorrow."
16088,Susan,i don't have to. i know you didn't.
15158,Susan,oh. so why are we dating?
15350,Susan,"well,for starters,because you banged your secretary,and you owe me for the rest of your life."
13949,Susan,a moray eel would seem safe after you.
17549,Susan,"just listen. daddy really wanted to be the one to teach you to ride your bike, and if you can already do it, it's gonna make him sad. so just let daddy push the button. understand?"
17540,Susan,yeah. he's been asking when you're coming. i can't wait to tell him. i know he'll be just--ah--
14996,Susan,"well, i wasn't consulted on that little arrangement."
16166,Susan,"well, that's just crazy! why are you acting like a crazy person?"
15840,Susan,i bet you'd move faster if jane were awake.
13781,Susan,"i don't think so, either."
17342,Susan,"oh. working. busy, busy, busy. uh, but he told me to tell you that he's totally cool with it."
14462,Susan,"look, um bob, let me try to explain."
13434,Susan,"oh, god. uh, i-stopped and i got this, uh. i am just so sorry for this."
16942,Susan,"well, i'm voting as a light sleeper. it's right outside our bedroom window. seriously, lynette, it's like living next to splash mountain."
14840,Susan,"well, right. i mean, there's that."
17005,Susan,so i'm thinking that it would be better if you could get her to research somebody else in her family.
17849,Susan,"'cause you were mad at bob, and i told you about how i sometimes sabotage my relationships."
15085,Susan,"you know,i'm gonna go, uh,help julie with the food.so you guys just keep talking and bowling.talk and bowl.bowl and talk."
15482,Susan,i can't believe you actually want to talk about feelings.you really have changed.
16403,Susan,you weren't tired a second ago.
14588,Susan,that's not zach.
18033,Susan,katherine and i told you guys we were taking the high road. why won't you believe us?
15733,Susan,"well, i'm sorry i cannot sit here on my key lime ass and watch bree make the worst mistake of her life!"
17368,Susan,"mike, that is so sweet. mike makes another good point. who is this professor? i don't know him. i am certainly not going to give my daughter to him for a summer. i'm sorry, julie. this is not happening."
16564,Susan,"well, clearly, you were not paying attention, because i did go back to mike the second he woke up, and he'd totally forgotten me!"
16835,Susan,"well, that's because i don't blush when orson says, ""open wide""."
16729,Susan,"yes,it is! what if you wanna have kids?"
13746,Susan,julie and i went over this morning.
13425,Susan,he's a taxidermist.
16256,Susan,"i'm sorry for eavesdropping, but don't you think your conversation is a little inappropriate? i mean, we're here to grieve, not cruise."
16121,Susan,"well, okay then. you know, mike barely remembers me. what makes you so sure he would fall in love with me again?"
14929,Susan,okay.
17444,Susan,"jackson, please take this seriously."
15516,Susan,she just--spit in your wings.
16496,Susan,"oh, all right, take his side!"
15787,Susan,right.
13790,Susan,"well, maybe we shouldn't be dating."
15703,Susan,"two, three.oh, itch, itch, itch.oh, itch, itch, itch."
15763,Susan,"bree, we have to talk."
14617,Susan,"hi, ida."" ""can we talk about this later? i just found out my ex is dating my neighbor, and i'm really ticked off."
15165,Susan,"the first time you'll see me naked,i'll be on an operating table."
13757,Susan,"of course, of course, yes. so, maybe we should make reservations, you know, just in case."
14912,Susan,we should not have done what we did.
16715,Susan,okay.
16522,Susan,"about that, uh, obviously, have been very confused. i finally saw a therapist. actually, it was sort of a court-ordered thing.anyway--well, i need to talk to you."
14186,Susan,yeah. the girls and i found a threatening note in her stuff.
16144,Susan,it's orson's wife. she can't know i called you.
17152,Susan,"julie, dylan's here! study time! i'm-- sorry. that was probably a little louder than it needed to be."
16515,Susan,what?
16614,Susan,"gaby, i spent months planning that wedding."
15359,Susan,"all right,but if i catch you guys in there talking about me,you're gonna be the one in a wheelchair."
17551,Susan,"no. he was absolutely waiting for you, you know, i think i'm gonna go check his helmet."
15749,Susan,oh please.
15580,Susan,"uh, no. no, i was up."
17679,Susan,how close are you? 'cause i can wait.
14287,Susan,morty? no!!
15260,Susan,what?
13691,Susan,i don't get it. i've gone through all your yearbooks and you and zach never went to school with anybody named dana.
15792,Susan,different?
14041,Susan,i've been so concerned about julie lately that i sort of eavesdropped on her the other day when she was having a phone conversation with zach.
15296,Susan,give me that. aah!
15432,Susan,"oh. oh,no,no,no.this is not happening."
14173,Susan,why would i go anywhere with you?
17629,Susan,"so we break up, and 15 minutes later you're with someone else? you got over me fast."
16750,Susan,"oh, my god. katherine."
14576,Susan,edie!
15934,Susan,i'd love to go to france someday.
15512,Susan,"okay, let's not make a scene.it's not worth it.for the sake of argument,let's--let's--let's say that it's someone else.you know, probably it would be a vulnerable, lonely woman who karl just took advantage of,and what if--this poor, confused soul begged your forgiveness?what would you say?"
16080,Susan,what's going on?
16985,Susan,"i don't know. it just bothers me. i mean-- my god, mike. he's your dad."
17224,Susan,you are never to come near my family ever again! do you understand?
14022,Susan,"just so we're clear, you are not allowed to see him anymore."
15283,Susan,i'm checking myself into the hospital.i'm finally gonna get that surgery.
15640,Susan,"oh, no, i'm sorry."
17708,Susan,no. why?
14885,Susan,so am i allowed to ask what happened?
15684,Susan,you really think that's what's gonna happen?
14677,Susan,"but he's with edie. i mean, she's not exactly the maternal type. i wouldn't be a good mother if i wasn't concerned. i mean, who knows what passes for a kid-friendly, good time in there? drugs? porn? smoking?"
15708,Susan,"well, in that case, thank you for my cheap knock-off.oh, my god, i'm late."
16824,Susan,"no, that was a year ago."
14529,Susan,it's funny you should mention sin. i think adultery still falls in that category.
18190,Susan,"remember to tell him ""annoying and persistent."" and i can make another casserole."
15985,Susan,"yes, and i am grateful, but i found a way to say thank you without taking my top off."
14436,Susan,oh no. no no no. they want to get their new life together started. we don't want to hold these two crazy kids back.
15273,Susan,"i don't know.you know,i'll just--i'll sell the car."
14826,Susan,"oh, my god. paul."
15880,Susan,"no, no.what we're doing today is a little more low-key. don't worry. you're totally safe. we're not doing anything wrong."
14144,Susan,"oh, god, you scared me."
18359,Susan,"it's sweet, but--yeah, it's ridiculous. and besides, um, m.j. and i have big plans this weekend."
15606,Susan,huh?
13458,Susan,"uh, no, it's not!"
16849,Susan,"okay, everybody, let the games begin. um, okay. i will be team captain one. who wants to be captain number two?"
14308,Susan,what?
16662,Susan,yeah. i'm calling her cell. it's ringing.
13981,Susan,"well, you get to build your dream house, for free. i mean, in a weird way, your house burning down was really a good thing."
13466,Susan,uh-
14043,Susan,zach was telling julie about what happened to dana.
16967,Susan,"do you see him? i mean, do you have a relationship with him?"
16919,Susan,oh. i just wanted them to like me.
17750,Susan,edie!
13314,Susan,"i don't like that word, julie. but yeah, that's a great example."
14525,Susan,really?
16744,Susan,more?
16646,Susan,so what do you think?
15047,Susan,"so, you are hereby released of any further obligation to be my dad."
14268,Susan,i was meaning to. i guess i do invite the drama in. just a little.
15892,Susan,"oh, uh, mike!"
17671,Susan,what?!
16277,Susan,"i know we've been fighting. something like this happens, it just puts everything into perspective. i am so sorry. it was all my fault. if i hadn't got so caught up in protecting mike--"
17110,Susan,imposing. who's imposing? you can stay as long as you want. i'm sorry. the words came out of my mouth before i knew what i was saying.
17626,Susan,susan. jackson's girlfriend.
14657,Susan,"in five seconds, i'm gonna punch it."
14680,Susan,"no. no. i mean, i'm a little surprised that you didn't ask me to accompany you first."
17146,Susan,"no, i know you're not."
16722,Susan,"okay,before we go any further,can i check those diplomas?'cause i would just like to make sure that they're not from some med school in the philippines."
14917,Susan,us? what do you mean? there's no us.
13338,Susan,"you're right. so, is that your project for school? you know in 5th grade i made the white house out of sugar cubes."
16638,Susan,"oh. oh! oh, i would love that!"
14928,Susan,we all cleared our schedules. we thought maybe you could use some company.
16636,Susan,what?
17592,Susan,"we wouldn't be here if it weren't for that accident. you know that. before that, we were good. we could get back there."
15681,Susan,"mike, my heart is in the exact right place."
14517,Susan,"i haven't heard back, and i was getting a little concerned. the girls and i were talking, and, we think that maybe paul young killed mrs. huber, and if he did, then maybe he killed your old girlfriend, too, so we should really talk about this, so call me. i love you. bye."
15324,Susan,"do i,though? i mean,i do.but i don't trust it anymore.you know,those relationships turned out to be disasters.maybe i should stick it out with dr. ron,and i should try heading down a road that's growing and slower into a sort of kind of love that would sustain itself for 50 years. right?stability,comfort,endurance--i deserve that."
14816,Susan,"mom, why don't you just go see a dressmaker?"
17515,Susan,"yeah, sure, on alternate weekends. that's fine--until-- m.j. needs his daddy, and his daddy's not there."
14814,Susan,hi. we're just going to a funeral.
13526,Susan,"actually, i just had dinner."
17545,Susan,you could've walked away.
14054,Susan,"okay. wow, uh, wow. you know, uh, can you sit down? i need, uh to talk to you."
14226,Susan,"all right, i promise."
16707,Susan,how's your aunt?katherine used to live here with mrs.sims.
18000,Susan,"yes, and imagine my surprise, 'cause the last time i talked to mike, he promised me he was picking up m.j. from school."
13948,Susan,a spark?
14028,Susan,so you're moving! we're all going to miss you.
13659,Susan,what's your favourite sport?
13345,Susan,edie. what are you--?
18271,Susan,"oh, my god. we're not gonna be able to make it this weekend. i'm kind of--getting married."
17414,Susan,"you know what, jackson? you're not gonna say anything i haven't already heard a million times. i-i only told you because i--i just want you to understand why i can't let you in my life."
16234,Susan,poor ian.
13857,Susan,my oven's out.
16748,Susan,hey!is something wrong?
16321,Susan,no. of course not.
17018,Susan,"sure, go ahead. oh, should i look you in the eyes? does it make it easier for you to lie?"
14198,Susan,angela -- that's what mary alice used to call herself.
18309,Susan,"oh, no, no, no. you--you can't take him now."
13360,Susan,edie?
17803,Susan,"hey, everybody! are we ready to have the best time ever?"
17755,Susan,yeah. can you imagine how upset i was when i discovered he's dating a friend of mine?
17054,Susan,he bought those pills a long time ago and never got around to paying the guy.
17600,Susan,unless you're not interested.
17854,Susan,jackson has made it pretty clear that he doesn't do good with long-distance relationships. i could lose him.
18247,Susan,"well, you did."
13819,Susan,that's a rationalization and you know it! see you at the show.
16653,Susan,"yeah, he sort of wants the day just to be about us. so we're gonna wait till the fall. i'm so sorry."
15176,Susan,what? you want me to put my life on the line to service your ego?
13518,Susan,"we, uh, got this by mistake."
15096,Susan,why don't we get our table?
17835,Susan,oh! knock yourself out.
14753,Susan,"well, i can't tell you. you know, you messed up a lot of people's lives. you can't run away from that."
16787,Susan,wait for it. wait for it. ta-da.
14345,Susan,do you need a reason beyond the fact he's the ice cream man?
14681,Susan,i play the piano. you know that.
13929,Susan,"uh, edie, it's not his birthday."
17127,Susan,"oh! this is a fix-up? well, i just--it never would have occurred to me, you know, because of the vast age difference. but, hell. why not? life is short. certainly shorter for walter."
16353,Susan,really? i think it's about someone else. he just wanted me to help him remember something.
16468,Susan,"no, i am beyond upset. you two want a decision? well, here's what i decide. there will be no kissing, and there will be no wedding, and there will be no damn cake!"
15093,Susan,i don't know.
17685,Susan,"oh! look at my little girl. isn't she adorable? oh, i missed her so much."
14787,Susan,utah. oh lord. why did i do this?
16290,Susan,hey. where were you off to so early this morning?
17650,Susan,"well, it means--no sex until at least date four."
17418,Susan,i told you the brakes were squeaking. i asked you to get them checked.
16469,Susan,you bet me in a game of poker?
14441,Susan,mother!
16667,Susan,"mike, these are all fairly standard wedding features. now you name one thing that you think is going over-the-top."
17364,Susan,"next week? w-well, that is a big--no."
15429,Susan,"no,no,no,no! it's not about what i want you to say.you have to want to say that you want to marry edie."
18016,Susan,"no, not evil. devious. well, you know, i hate to tell you, but your big plan is not gonna work, 'cause from now on, m.j. is either at my house or mike's. he is no longer allowed to be here."
17080,Susan,"you might think you have things under control, but they're only gonna get worse--and with a baby on the way."
13870,Susan,"young lady, we need to talk about what you did."
14135,Susan,"okay. uh, yes. he came over around ten o'clock."
14169,Susan,doesn't matter anymore.
18234,Susan,mike and i got in a car accident.
13613,Susan,well thank god for the thin blue line!
15119,Susan,"let's just say if i was a senior in high school,i'd be saying,""wow,you're a hot fifth grader."""
14157,Susan,"i'm such an idiot! and you're such a liar! oh, and apparently a killer!"
16160,Susan,ian. wait!
16865,Susan,"it's okay. i just wanna know what's going on. ever since you've been pregnant, there's been this wall between us. it's like something's changed, and i don't know why. did i do something to offend you?"
15600,Susan,"hey.you know,i am not even tired.so-- why don't i stay up and help you?"
15186,Susan,"well, we were just wondering--actually, we were curious about, um--"
13971,Susan,journals?
14863,Susan,"please, no, please, please. no, mike! mike!"
14310,Susan,"oh, i'm so sorry. here lean your head back."
13770,Susan,"oh, of course."
17603,Susan,um--no.
15024,Susan,i'm sorry. how is trying to pick up a hooker not your fault?
17399,Susan,"mm. uh, lynette, it's not really a good time."
14232,Susan,sorry.
18042,Susan,"uh, nothing."
17937,Susan,i'm not surprised. he was a good man.
16476,Susan,"hell, there's some things we don't need to know about."
14138,Susan,"he dropped his gun, cleaning it."
14070,Susan,pretty impressive.
14061,Susan,"well, whatever it was, that boy is seriously disturbed, and i've forbidden julie from hanging out with him."
15200,Susan,"no, no,i think she's onto something."
15963,Susan,"yeah, but there's a crazy woman in there!"
14369,Susan,mother!
17928,Susan,"actually, um--jackson and i split up."
16268,Susan,"ian, are you proposing to me?"
16532,Susan,that's not true. i will get over him.
17051,Susan,"thank you. hey, you know, would you like me to pack some up for you guys to take?"
16823,Susan,"hi, gaby. it's me. i'm throwing a party saturday night. guess what kind?"
13769,Susan,why do you care so much?
16140,Susan,"well, he does, and so he's pretending he didn't. that's suspicious, right?"
13349,Susan,"well, i've got one."
16055,Susan,"no, please, listen--the last couple of months, i thought we've gotten really close, and i have been loving that. i just feel like lately--there's this limit to how far you'll let me in."
16336,Susan,i should probably get these inside.
18207,Susan,"okay, well--at least you're making plans for the future."
14901,Susan,why would you--?
17446,Susan,thank you. now go shave. you look like a hobo.
16767,Susan,"well, uh, well, the johnson's live right down the road. yeah, i guess that's fine."
16430,Susan,i was in shock.
18091,Susan,"though i would definitely appreciate the--beauty of the gazelle, uh, if i was going to take a trip to africa--"
18319,Susan,i'd just feel more comfortable if i'm close by.
16534,Susan,"hi, ida.what's up?"
16808,Susan,"okay, i admit that there's a certain lack of consistency there."
17853,Susan,mike and i will never get back together. i know that now. and i really need to move on with my life.
14547,Susan,no!
14974,Susan,why?
16414,Susan,"hi. ian, about what i said--"
17709,Susan,tonight?! isn't that lovely?
15405,Susan,"karl!karl,stop! stop!oh! it's an emergency."
14066,Susan,and meticulously hand painted. whoever sent you that must really love you.
16016,Susan,bree said you got a job on the first day. you're such a star! i want details.
17836,Susan,oh! jazz!
14326,Susan,why?
17601,Susan,i gave romance a shot and--i'm ready for something a little more casual.
16587,Susan,"oh, mike."
17310,Susan,that--turns out i spilled some club soda.
14621,Susan,"oh, i've never applied that concept to your father's sex life and you know it."
14626,Susan,"oh, um, your father just came over that day and told me some stuff. you know, some stuff that i haven't and can't tell you."
16606,Susan,is this a bad time?
17627,Susan,"well, when guys go slut hunting, they tend not to play the girlfriend card."
16305,Susan,it's perfect.
16728,Susan,"yeah,the part before death. oh!"
18078,Susan,i don't know.
13622,Susan,it's complicated. i get it.
17045,Susan,"oh, mike, you're home. i was dreaming we were ponies."
16539,Susan,i love you.
13634,Susan,i've got one. kelly holstatter. in eighth grade she used to spit in my gym shoes.
14514,Susan,i'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
17879,Susan,lunch. it was lunch.
17003,Susan,maybe dylan should ask her mom.
14968,Susan,i just want to see what he's like. and satisfy my curiosity and get it out of my system.
16335,Susan,"trust him, he's not."
16795,Susan,we need whipped cream.
17176,Susan,so you didn't go back?
13502,Susan,"i'll be quick. brandy, i'm sorry for the way i treated you. it was uncalled for, and childish, and it won't happen again. i have built up a lot of anger towards you, both of you, and i realise now that i just can't carry that around anymore. so, apology or no apology, i'm moving on."
15409,Susan,that's great.
14970,Susan,"oh, oh, no. that's okay, you don't have to give me anything, really."
16935,Susan,i have a lovely voice.
14714,Susan,"no, not at all."
13987,Susan,i just know mrs. huber's death's been hard on you. i want to help.
13730,Susan,"no kidding, is she here?"
16113,Susan,i'm pretty sure that bree's husband murdered the woman the cops think mike killed. i went to his office--
13996,Susan,me?
13621,Susan,you don't have to explain.
17004,Susan,"okay, don't tell anybody i told you this. her mom said something at my party about her dad being abusive towards katherine--and maybe dylan, too."
15984,Susan,who cares? go!
16480,Susan,"oh, good. i hope the thorns rip him to shreds."
16061,Susan,you have to kiss me. it's the law.
15757,Susan,"my friend is marrying that man in two hours. please? okay, i need, um, ten dollars in unrolled pennies and i need to see you count it. 'cause last time you stiffed me.'"
17020,Susan,"mike, we don't need any of that stuff."
16973,Susan,"great. uh, diabetes?"
18402,Susan,"dave, please. please. i cannot imagine the pain you went through, but you can't do this. you can't kill my little boy!"
16445,Susan,did i mention that maggie is an amazing chef? we're embarrassed to be cooking for her.
17244,Susan,what does that mean?
13594,Susan,i think this is a screwdrivert left behind by the burglar. and i didn't touch it.
14612,Susan,i live on this street. your daughter lives on this street. i will not have you flaunting your sexcapades in front of us.
17245,Susan,"okay, clearly, this is not going to work. so why don't you take your child bride and find another class?"
16891,Susan,"hi. i wanted to bring you a ""welcome to the neighborhood"" present. you should try one while they're still warm from the oven."
14686,Susan,"oh. oh, okay."
16377,Susan,"oh, my god. mike, you saved our lives."
15897,Susan,this should never have happened!
15915,Susan,ah.
18355,Susan,"oh, the truth is, um--well, it's complicated."
18209,Susan,how about a pot of coffee? or i could just--straighten up in here?
14383,Susan,i'm going to handle this once and for all.
17439,Susan,"ah, no."
17226,Susan,so you don't know that your husband tried to kill mike?
18365,Susan,"oh, the joys of being a parent."
14285,Susan,you're not tired. you took a nap. what is it?
18263,Susan,maximum allowance exceeded.
14017,Susan,you think?
15929,Susan,mm.
15471,Susan,i remember.i also remember that you are planning on marrying someone else.
13717,Susan,"oh my god, look at this embroidery."
18123,Susan,"okay, just so you know, should be bringing this to the psychologist. but i didn't, because this kind of ""self-expression"" usually gets a kid expelled."
14294,Susan,"okay, look; i'm just saying i don't think morty cheated on you."
16757,Susan,i know. i will lend you my salad bowl. you really don't wanna miss bree's pie. it's perfect.
16678,Susan,"okay, seriously, you don't have to kill yourself. i could max out my credit card."
17589,Susan,are we doing the right thing here?
16145,Susan,"right. sorry. uh, i'm just new to this whole snitch thing. hold on, okay?"
14120,Susan,"yes, i was. it was a big night for us, relationship-wise. it was the first time that we--"
15333,Susan,"mmm,mike,mike,mike--"
13933,Susan,okay.
14058,Susan,no?
14828,Susan,"no, don't come near me."
16205,Susan,he's not crazy about me spending time with my ex.
17652,Susan,what's my least favorite word?
16307,Susan,how was the game?
15132,Susan,"hey,dr. ron?i just have a feeling that everything's gonna turn out fine.and when it does--i'd like to buy you dinner to celebrate my health.you know,i was thinking maybe italian?oh,what the heck,maybe we can call it a date.if you like.dr. ron?"
15040,Susan,"i'm so sorry. i thought you should know, but he didn't want to tell you."
14866,Susan,you walked out on me.
16076,Susan,"bree, you have got to go to the police with all of this."""
17995,Susan,"well, it's not better for me, especially when i'm not even told about it."
17453,Susan,"mike told you about the ear thing, didn't he?"
16152,Susan,i was really touched by your call. it was so big of you.
18013,Susan,you think i don't feed my kid?
17072,Susan,"oh, of course, and you know all about shoulder pain--being a dentist."
14882,Susan,"oh, karl. what do you want?"
17564,Susan,"okay, you know what? this is not jackson's fault. you can't give a 5-year-old a bike and expect him to wait to ride it until you have time. you know, this is what it means to be divorced. it means that sometimes you won't be there."
17023,Susan,yeah.
17115,Susan,"oh, my god! i want to eat that."
17837,Susan,i don't know. i was drunk.
17332,Susan,you sure? it's worth a phone call.
17120,Susan,"no. that walter guy needs to stay miserable, because if he's not, he'll fix her roof, and then she'll leave us."
15078,Susan,"no, and we're not planning on telling him."
17985,Susan,well--listen to me. the whole reason i went back to work is so we could both afford to give m.j. the things we felt he needed. now i'm doing my part. it's time you do yours.
15895,Susan,see? evil! evil!
14512,Susan,bree.
15634,Susan,"of course not, but when you see it for the first time, i want you to get the whole impact. ta-da!"
15454,Susan,"my ex-boyfriend's here.if he sees me alone,i'll die.i'm begging you,please,act like you know me."
17056,Susan,yeah. why?
17294,Susan,nice? she's driving me crazy. you have got to stop complaining about me to her.
14843,Susan,"oh. i forgot about that. i just can't believe it. i mean, there he is, a murderer, just living right on our street, and there's nothing we can do about it because you're a convicted felon and i burned down that stupid house. it's unfair."
13595,Susan,"i tried! but they sort of laughed at me, because apparently nothing was taken from mrs fome's house."
14395,Susan,"mike, i know why i was planning to stay away from him, but why do you want me to stay away from him?"
16141,Susan,"oh, uh, can you hold on?"
17289,Susan,what are you gonna do?
15697,Susan,but i like doing it.i think mike would want me to.oops.
17672,Susan,"jackson, look at me. i'm tipsy. i'm horny. i'm easier than a 5-year-old's homework."
16366,Susan,oh. okay.
16641,Susan,"i mean, i've never seen gaby so torn up with guilt."
14651,Susan,"honestly, edie, i don't mind. you can skate off into the sunset with karl. be my guest."
16074,Susan,thank you. you are a lifesaver.
17393,Susan,"you know, you're a guy, and we just had hot sex, and i didn't force you to cuddle. so run! go! brag to your friends."
16361,Susan,"mike,it wasn't a movie.that was us."
13813,Susan,sure. do you want to tell me why you had your foot in john rowland's crotch yesterday?
16718,Susan,sorry.
15553,Susan,"tu-tuesday?no,no,tuesday's not good,'cause tuesday's the day i,um--become a lesbian."
14027,Susan,really!
13329,Susan,"now that everybody's seen that i've brought something, i should probably just throw this out."
17144,Susan,"okay, so back to these receipts."
17340,Susan,hello. i need to change the name on my baby's birth certificate.
14402,Susan,yeah.
13855,Susan,"damn, karl, i'm not even married to him anymore and he's still keeping me from having sex."
18231,Susan,can't we just keep going the way we are?
16937,Susan,"hear, hear."
14108,Susan,will you just call?
17320,Susan,"it sounds like ""mucus."""
14962,Susan,"are you saying that all this time my father has been alive, and just right across town running the supply and feed store?"
15063,Susan,you do?
17883,Susan,"hey, i was single for several months after karl and after mike."
16404,Susan,why not?
14124,Susan,"mike! mike, are you okay?"
16772,Susan,missy taylor?
15310,Susan,"oh,no. no,no.no,no,nurse hisel.ow,ow,ow,ow!"
15191,Susan,"bree, we know that you have a good reason for wanting betty to hang out with us.we just-- wondered if you could clue us in a little."
17954,Susan,what's going on?
14060,Susan,yeah.
16594,Susan,"hi, curt. susan mayer. you did my wedding invitations? uh, i'm gonna need another batch. exactly the same, only change the name ian hainsworth to mike delfino. long story. call me."
18254,Susan,what is it?
13986,Susan,"well, you know high school. thank god we leave that behind!"
15250,Susan,"karl,i think there might be snakes in here."
16887,Susan,"well, yeah. i don't bake. catch up."
14225,Susan,"thanks, i will."
15605,Susan,"so, uh, y-you then a-admit burning down my house on purpose?"
15976,Susan,"oh, my gosh.lynette."
16589,Susan,"hey, fran_ois, it's susan mayer. um, call me as soon as you get this. i know i told you that my wedding is off, but it's back on, and i wanna see if you're still available to do the flowers. bye. oh, um, just so you know, ian's not the groom anymore. long story. call me."
13334,Susan,"hi mike. i brought you a little housewarming gift. i probably should've brought something by earlier, but--"
15226,Susan,"oh, no,it's a serious illness.see, it just sounds silly 'cause of the word ""spleen."""
17575,Susan,what took you so long? people are gonna be here any minute. i need you to pour the cheap vodka into the expensive bottles.
14406,Susan,huh?
15734,Susan,well. um. honestly--
17358,Susan,mm. maynard. let's hope he's worthy.
17518,Susan,"well, i don't see any kid of yours being a victim. you're the strongest person i know."
16605,Susan,"oh, right! i have to cancel my wedding--again!"
15590,Susan,"yeah, he just heard about the fire and came over to help.we're friends."
13342,Susan,hi.
15228,Susan,yeah.
13755,Susan,"sounds great. um, you do know that it's like a two-hour drive up there. and isn't that kind of late to be coming back?"
18163,Susan,how?
14895,Susan,nope. this one's for adults about all my failed relationships.
16946,Susan,"did i? well, that's obviously wrong."
15772,Susan,ian?
15779,Susan,"ah, wow, look at the view!oh.don't you just love when the leaves change color."
15834,Susan,"mike woke up. um, julie, when, when did he--julie? julie! oh, damn it! oh, my god. oh! oh, my god! um, uh, i, i, i have to go. um, i gotta get out of here."
14939,Susan,yeah?
17415,Susan,"yeah, i guess i could handle that."
15044,Susan,"believe me, i didn't want to hurt anyone. i just wanted to find my dad."
18157,Susan,"well, it depends on what i'm running away from!"
18395,Susan,canterbury road? that's where we--
13734,Susan,"no, you give me a break! i did not follow you here, and even if i had followed you here, it's because you've been so secretive about kendra."
13874,Susan,what is that supposed to mean?
18357,Susan,really.
16822,Susan,i'm eating for two.
18073,Susan,"oh, me, too. you know, i think we should probably keep this between us. we don't want people talking at work."
16968,Susan,"well, i've got to meet him."
16133,Susan,"yeah, and he is fantastic. you cannot believe the scum he has gotten off. not that you're scum. but, you know, if you were, you'd be sitting pretty."
17968,Susan,"but you can't go around blowing your kid's money on jewelry for your girlfriend. what did these cost you? $4,000, $5,000?"
16593,Susan,you can't invite people to a wedding on the phone. you have to send a proper invitation. you want people to think i'm a complete flake?
16274,Susan,"andrew, what are you doing at the hospital?"
18202,Susan,"uh, wait. could you maybe have one right now so that i know that you actually ate something?"
14548,Susan,"not so tough now, are you?"
14574,Susan,no.
18208,Susan,"uh, well, i should probably--put these away before i finish them off. are you sure there's nothing i can do to help you? a load of laundry?"
17016,Susan,"is it so horrible living with me? i mean, do i make you so miserable that you can't even face me without numbing the pain?"
16706,Susan,i cannot believe it has been 12 years.you haven't changed a bit.
17896,Susan,july?
16557,Susan,"can't? there's no ""can't"" in love. there's a man on that mountain that i intend to spend the rest of my life with, and nothing is gonna keep me from him-- not fate, not destiny and definitely not you."
14729,Susan,"well, thanks for your discretion."
17019,Susan,me feel guilty?
17388,Susan,mike.
16416,Susan,yeah.
15889,Susan,"mike, i don't know what edie's been telling you, but ian and i, we're just friends."
15261,Susan,okay.
18019,Susan,what?
15528,Susan,well--that is karl being nostalgic.
15216,Susan,no. it can't wait.
15255,Susan,"oh,i have a wedding that day."
15219,Susan,okay.
15870,Susan,i've been wondering why mike's been so cold to me. now it all makes sense.
16265,Susan,i'm so sorry i ruined jane's funeral.
17062,Susan,no.
17314,Susan,"no, no, no, i love where this is going."
17763,Susan,bree?
17025,Susan,hey.
16251,Susan,so how are you holding up?
16629,Susan,oh! well--
15167,Susan,"so this whole splenectomy thing--you feel good about it, huh?"
15161,Susan,"oh, well, okay.i mean,i guess-- i guess you guys probably have all sorts of new, exciting techniques where you don't even cut open the body."
15570,Susan,"oh, no, no.everybody's been very helpful.um, everybody likes me.absolutely--"
15866,Susan,"uh, that's my macaroni and cheese. i-i was hoping it would trigger mike's memory. i made it the first time we met two years ago."
16492,Susan,i'm taking my damn space!
17334,Susan,maynard.
16198,Susan,you do not get to decide this for her! what were you thinking?!
14071,Susan,mike wants babies.
16513,Susan,what? i thought you said she was with victor.
15705,Susan,"oh, i would love to but i think i'm in a rush here.i'm supposed to meet my girlfriends for lunch at 1:00.is it 1:00 yet?"
17293,Susan,"well, that's gonna change real soon."
13325,Susan,"i made it, trust me. hey, hey, do you have a death wish?"
16433,Susan,"hi, ian. i just asked mike. he can't make it."
15252,Susan,hi!happy valentine's day.
14230,Susan,oh.
17273,Susan,"um, well--i guess mike didn't tell you that i'm, uh, really not a cook."
17607,Susan,where's karen?
17139,Susan,sorry.
18131,Susan,"don't worry, edie. you're gonna get through this. you're gonna be just fine."
13710,Susan,old friend?
17523,Susan,"well, i sort of started seeing someone."
17757,Susan,"you know, she has wanted to get her hooks into mike for years. every time she would have us over for a barbecue, she always wore something booby."
14924,Susan,why are you giving it to me?
14472,Susan,i knew he was good. i just knew it.
16369,Susan,"oh, my god. are you okay?"
14307,Susan,"well, you don't have a place to live. you don't like to work. i mean, you didn't want to marry morty, so he doesn't have to pay you alimony. i- i- it's just if you don't go back to this man who allegedly shoved you once in five years, what are your options?"
14451,Susan,stop.
13623,Susan,"i told him another man asked me out, it was the perfect opportunity for mike to be jealous. and nothing."
14987,Susan,mr. prudy. hello.
15540,Susan,why?
15656,Susan,"well, actually, i think that twins are genetically determined by the mother."
15140,Susan,"i know. i know.i feel really awful.i am just not the best at meeting men.and i thought you were cute,and i sort of thought that maybe you thought i was cute,and you're a doctor,and that's so sexy."
17425,Susan,fine.
13456,Susan,what cabin?
14199,Susan,"we heard it on this tape that bree stole from her therapist's office. it's a long story. i'll tell you later. oh, we got to put this in."
14563,Susan,"honey, you can let it out."
15400,Susan,"okay,yes,i am closer to your father than i have been in the past.the bitter hatred's now settled into a respectful disgust.that's the kind of thing most children of divorce dream about."
13692,Susan,did it sound like a relative?
16618,Susan,i'm rushing? you met victor three months ago. i've known mike three years.
14222,Susan,"great, just great!"
15207,Susan,"oh! oh, ah. sure, that's--wednesday's great.i'm--i'm just curious--how did edie convince you to do this so quickly?"
16169,Susan,"yes, i have."
16803,Susan,i am taking you home. this party is out of control.
15913,Susan,don't worry. it won't last. you're just fooling yourselves!
16820,Susan,yeah. got it.
15503,Susan,"well, every situation is different,and it's hard to judge until we know all the details."
16283,Susan,it's true. he's gonna be a free man. isn't that great?
18029,Susan,thank you.
16015,Susan,"hey, you're back! i'd give you a hug, but i'm really sweaty. so how was new york?"
15694,Susan,he does.
13474,Susan,"i'm not really ready for this, i was gonna have a whole speech prepared."
16012,Susan,"no, i'm good. thanks."
18090,Susan,excuse me?
16503,Susan,"well--i was engaged to ian, so--obviously i loved him."
15944,Susan,really?
17029,Susan,"i did, too, and do you know what else he has pierced? and if you do, you're grounded."
16207,Susan,don't you love this guy? what's the strategy?
18164,Susan,wow. you're just a giver.
18211,Susan,do you know what is a great cure for the blues? cribbage. do you have a cribbage set?
16853,Susan,"honey, i love you, but i wanna win."
16057,Susan,no.
13937,Susan,yeah. he's a great guy.
14660,Susan,"edie, for god's sake. why would i care if you end up with a man i despise?"
16625,Susan,i got you a blender for christmas.
17826,Susan,"oh, i'll have what you're having."
15777,Susan,"oh, well, it's been a long time since i've been in the mood to. thank you."
17946,Susan,fantastic!
16347,Susan,what's that?
14111,Susan,can you hold these a sec?
17519,Susan,"well, i thought i had you beaten today, and next think i knew, i was eating grass."
15637,Susan,ohh! that's my girl!
15336,Susan,great.i'm about to be released.
14542,Susan,"i gotta say, i think you're making a mistake. mike couldn't kill anybody. i mean, this could just be a misunderstanding."
13778,Susan,ooooeeewwwoooohhh--
15638,Susan,"no! no. it's all good. oh! but you should know that your bed doubles as the dining table, and the toilet's in the shower."
16996,Susan,"no, they just had a baby. we're gonna ""ooh,"" we're gonna ""ahh,"" and then we're gonna eat."
13676,Susan,just for a couple of hours.
15268,Susan,"oh,hi. um,do you see that man over there?dark hair,handsome.i need you to slip this to him without anybody noticing."
15490,Susan,"our marriage was garbage!stupid,disgusting pile of garbage!"
17582,Susan,get out.
13364,Susan,oh..
14891,Susan,"well, these days anybody going through a break-up gets my sympathy."
17505,Susan,"i'm sorry. juanita, i just wanted you to see how it felt. are you okay?"
13483,Susan,and then i fell. so how are you?
15135,Susan,"oh,are you sure?um,because i would look a lot better over the phone right now."
17280,Susan,"although he also enjoys coming home to sesame chicken from red panda, and they deliver."
13482,Susan,locked myself out. naked.
15328,Susan,"oh,it means a lot to me that you came."
16338,Susan,yeah. that was the first night that we spent together. i wanted to surprise you.
15235,Susan,what the hell?
16659,Susan,"gaby, bree went out of her way to buy you that bracelet."
17815,Susan,i don't know. i--you don't ever think about it?
13487,Susan,"okay. i know what just happened is funny, in theory, but i am nowhere near ready to laugh about it. so please, no jokes."
14403,Susan,believe whatever you want.
18125,Susan,"marisa? well, why would he draw a picture of her like this?"
15899,Susan,i just dropped my trowel. thanks.
15005,Susan,"bree, i'm so sorry."
16881,Susan,"oh. oh! oh, that's super! yeah, i've seen a lot of cable, so i get it. you're just great."
14955,Susan,"okay, again, what does this have to do with my father?"
15693,Susan,"i've got everything ready to go-- flowers, candles,elvis costello cd all cued up."
15595,Susan,"yeah, when you flip out in front of the pep squad,word travels fast."
14139,Susan,"well, i wouldn't know about that."
13954,Susan,oh my god. this is so wonderful!
18143,Susan,funny and likes to gossip. we're gonna get along just fine.
15166,Susan,i'm curious. um--why were you so congratulatory?
17535,Susan,"oh, my god. this is about m.j.'s drawing, isn't it?"
16007,Susan,it's not what you think.
15902,Susan,"oh, uh, they're moving along. it's a process."
15906,Susan,mike? it's me. are you decent?
15423,Susan,this is your father's bartender bible.see if you can find a recipe for a rusty nail.
14447,Susan,"oh, of course."
16685,Susan,"yeah, it was really impressive. so what are you doing tonight?"
17227,Susan,"trying to protect your mother? i know. who cares? you drove the car, you ran him over, and you left him for dead!"
14302,Susan,lynette!
13586,Susan,"but remember what the note said ""i know what you did. it makes me sick. i'm going to tell"". that's not the kind of thing that someone writes to themselves. that's a message, sent by an enemy."
14666,Susan,"no! no! it's just, we were married. and, and she's trying to make this tawdry little affair you guys have going on par with that and it's just, i got mad."
17117,Susan,i hope you don't mind that i'm going to kiss you.
14667,Susan,just give me a moment. i'm asking god to kill me.
16296,Susan,reception?
17822,Susan,"you, bob, andrew."
14159,Susan,"no, no, no. now, i know how much you were looking forward to this weekend with your dad. i'm fine."
17488,Susan,what?
13419,Susan,that is a beautiful rose. where did you get it?
17200,Susan,"well, it was just sort of muttering. were you having a dream about him?"
18224,Susan,it's just your belts and ties. the police kept the rest.
18415,Susan,"oh, you did it again!"
18083,Susan,"you know, i-i think you may have gotten the wrong impression. i'm not--into women."
17391,Susan,"i don't know. come on, zippy, zippy."
16260,Susan,"okay, it's me."
14192,Susan,i don't know. just something suspicious.
14083,Susan,"oh, that's so wonderful what you wrote, thank you. okay, i'm not gonna be any kind of company until i get something off my chest. do you remember the other day when you said that you wanted to have kids?"
13424,Susan,"mm, that's mr. mullin. and just so you know, if he invites you in, you have to meet all of his pets."
13447,Susan,so when is this shindig?
14722,Susan,i accept.
14664,Susan,"oh, my god."
13861,Susan,mike?
15912,Susan,it was spur-of-the-moment.
13832,Susan,i thought that--
16387,Susan,i guess we're gonna cut right to the--
14337,Susan,the day my mother will need to come and live with me and i won't have a choice.
17031,Susan,"oh, fine. break my heart."
17234,Susan,"and he's right. i have to find a way to make peace with all of this. but you need to understand, it's gonna be one of the hardest things i've ever done. and like most things in my life, i probably won't do it with much elegance or grace. so if i don't come over to your house for coffee--if i don't smile when the two of you walk by, just please know that i still love you. and for forgiving orson--just be patient. i'll get there."
17548,Susan,"oh, honey. you know how you like to push the button when we go on the elevator, and if somebody else pushes it first, it makes you sad?"
13714,Susan,mike had to reschedule.
17758,Susan,"well, it doesn't matter. she's my friend. she should've come to me and discussed it first."
16924,Susan,i should go.
15893,Susan,"no, no, no, no! no, no, this--this is not how this ends. no, evil does not triumph over good."
14460,Susan,"oh, hi. i'm looking for kendra taylor-"
14343,Susan,the kids are waiting.
16930,Susan,"oh, my god. wow! it's a fountain, too."
14975,Susan,thank you.
13380,Susan,i keep hoping he'll ask me out.
14322,Susan,morty!
14370,Susan,"oh, i'm embarrassing you."
15412,Susan,"oh,no,that's okay."
16246,Susan,you're right. i'll keep looking.
13343,Susan,are you busy?
14894,Susan,yeah.
14096,Susan,"hey, lynette."
14633,Susan,"i don't know. since the guy who held me hostage turned out to be your son, i think logic dictates that i should move on. the problem is, i'm crazy about you."
15463,Susan,"did i call edie a slut?well,that's overstating it.edie's not a slut.she's just-- popular with indiscriminate men.anyway-- yes,those are the relevant players."
14007,Susan,"of course, anything. uh, you name it! what?"
16111,Susan,but they're not here.
13625,Susan,so what's going on there?
13335,Susan,really?
18088,Susan,"actually, i'm more worried about the lesbian that's outside of me trying to get in. um, can we just teach the class and talk about this later?"
15860,Susan,"yeah! see how much fun we were? so i dragged you out onto the dance floor, and, well, you were giving me this look--sort of like the look you're giving me right now--and, um, i started to do this--and then you did this--"
18424,Susan,"i'm having trouble with the family across the street. i think one of them may have set a fire in my house, and i don't know why, but i feel like it might have something to do with my friend who killed herself. i called the police, but they didn't take me seriously. this family has a secret, a bad secret. i think i'm in over my head. i need you to find out everything you can about paul young and his family. do you think you can help me?"
16304,Susan,"oh, no, th--"
14735,Susan,what?
13390,Susan,well. i order takeout.
16734,Susan,"yep,we're doomed."
16005,Susan,that is the subject!
14480,Susan,i cannot believe you are still coming onto him.
15233,Susan,but-- we were actually married.
14283,Susan,"yeah, you know, it's the third time around for both of you, and you're really clicking. it gives me hope."
14849,Susan,"well, he's not here."
17622,Susan,that's not enough.
15081,Susan,"zach,i'm glad you could make it."
17723,Susan,"hey, jackson. where are you going? the guys are about to start."
17573,Susan,"no, it wouldn't."
13423,Susan,oh.
13410,Susan,"i just wanted to come by and say hello, you know, see how you guys are doing."
14636,Susan,jogging? there's no law against jogging.
14888,Susan,did she cheat?
13411,Susan,i can only imagine. not knowing why mary alice?
17135,Susan,and jam.
17101,Susan,"yes, yes, i do. i do. so i want you to go over to those paramedics, and i want you to let them look at these cuts. because you don't want to be all bloody when they pull your kids out of there, do you?"
17102,Susan,what?
17474,Susan,"out, uh, doing some thinking. and i've decided that i may have gone a little overboard about you and mike. in fact, i think it's cool if you wanna hang out with my ex."
15494,Susan,"if edie doesn't know,then that means that you just cheated on her with me."
13439,Susan,"well, it was your dog, i get it."
17677,Susan,i thought you were blocked.
13807,Susan,later? what's wrong with now?
17469,Susan,i don't--
16138,Susan,"detective ridley, my name is susan mayer, and i'm calling to ""drop a dime"" on someone. that's the expression, right?"
15384,Susan,"i said something to dr. ron before the operation,and it just--devastated him."
16010,Susan,"your feelings? my god, you are the worst bad cop ever! go to your room. not you! get back here!"
14856,Susan,what?
14191,Susan,"martha huber was your best friend. if we could find out who really killed her, wouldn't that be worth the risk?"
14221,Susan,"no, no no. that's okay, i don't wanna, you know, litter."
13563,Susan,"alright, back up a little more. there you go. wooo! alright, here we go."
14105,Susan,"now, did he? we don't know that for sure. all we know is that lynette's kids turned up with it."
13315,Susan,sorry i'm late.
17504,Susan,"oh, really? you don't think it would hurt?"
17046,Susan,"hey, that kid, um, barrett came by today."
16069,Susan,is it really important that i make them a home-cooked meal?
16398,Susan,"yes. i wanna spend time in your world. i wanna play cricket, and i wanna eat crumpets, and i want to use the word ghastly."
16726,Susan,no.i'm sorry.i'm just a little--you know what? forget it.let's eat.
16752,Susan,she said dylan's not the same girl.
17678,Susan,"so you've broken through your creative logjam? congratulations! ooh, why not celebrate by ripping off my clothes with your teeth?"
17659,Susan,blocked?
16671,Susan,what?
14021,Susan,"you're not going, you're going to stay here and talk about this."
15052,Susan,"okay, one more."
17745,Susan,"i'm not, but now you have to tell me who she is. fine. have it your way. oh, if he ever needs a transfusion, you are not allowed to give him my blood."
17762,Susan,"well, now you're not."
16817,Susan,thanks.
17643,Susan,sounds great. pick me up at 7:00.
14168,Susan,"i was on vacation. made sense at the time. okay, not to be rude, but is there a reason you're here?"
16886,Susan,"oh, look, i made a terrible first impression, so i thought i'd make them some of my home-baked goodness."
15441,Susan,that the wedding's off.
14181,Susan,"i don't know. obviously, a bad guy. somebody really awful, somebody like -- somebody like paul young."
15352,Susan,i lied and i told himi didn't know a mike.
14614,Susan,"well, i just bet she is!"
13953,Susan,wow. just so we're clear. you want to move back in here and be faithful to me and love me with all your heart and soul?
14493,Susan,"so, what do you think we should do for dinner?"
14030,Susan,"anyway, you won't even know i'm there."
16577,Susan,mike. i twisted my ankle.
16209,Susan,that's still ten years in prison.
13415,Susan,"yeah, well, if edie's gonna be there, i'm gonna need emotional support."
17256,Susan,i know.
16065,Susan,"right. so, um, do you want me to make reservations at that little french place?"
16036,Susan,wow! your timing's perfect.
13927,Susan,what the hell is she doing here?
15355,Susan,what?
14368,Susan,you've been married four times.
15115,Susan,"oh,he could be cuter--but i don't know how."
16880,Susan,"oh, you're partners. what kind of business? you know, whatever it is, just don't let the neighborhood association hear that you work out of your house. they're so not cool."
15888,Susan,"yes! that's progress! see? oh, it's all gonna come back. we're gonna be us again!"
15850,Susan,i was in the country. but i'm back now.
14575,Susan,it wasn't like that.
18244,Susan,"how's it feeling, mrs. mccluskey?"
14380,Susan,oh! oh! how did you get down there? that's not funny.
15027,Susan,what?
17173,Susan,"i don't want to hear this. i'm done with both of you. if anybody needs me, i'll be at the mall--buying sheets."
17262,Susan,"okay, karl, you win. you happy?"
17907,Susan,so--is she in?
17466,Susan,i am such a jackass.
14430,Susan,are you crazy? it's one o'clock in the morning. she's sleeping.
17192,Susan,"no, no, no, no. no, i did not have a sex dream."
17317,Susan,apology accepted. let's go. aah!
18111,Susan,okay. so--that man must be a doctor making the bloody man all better?
17379,Susan,seriously--i just lean on you in ways you don't even know.
13739,Susan,"oh god, why couldn't i have just have been knocked unconscious?"
17606,Susan,"well, you really went all out."
16149,Susan,"bree--i just want you to know that no matter what, your friendship means the world to me."
15940,Susan,"the last time i checked, i was the parent."
14347,Susan,mom!
16856,Susan,dibs on lynette! she's on my team!
13381,Susan,shouldn't you be making brownies for your nerdy friends?
15203,Susan,i came as soon as i got your message. is this--?
13893,Susan,"so, i had a really good time."
17915,Susan,"yard sale! good. you're here. how are you, eli?"
16819,Susan,oh.
13444,Susan,"be nice, i come bearing snacks."
13465,Susan,"yeah, well you just go to hell."
13984,Susan,"i'll go with you, edie."
17254,Susan,"well, after this, we have a big party to go to."
18156,Susan,i don't think so.
15650,Susan,thanks.
13735,Susan,and i came here to ride the bull!
15347,Susan,"wow, she's-- gorgeous."
13773,Susan,"if you came in here to judge me, you can just leave!"
18080,Susan,the second one?
17276,Susan,don't do that--mama.
15456,Susan,"good.oh!god,i--i'm being so rude.um,mike,i-i want you to meet--"
17645,Susan,okay.
14323,Susan,"well, even so!"
14492,Susan,"i appreciate what you guys are trying to do, i really do. um, i'm not gonna change my mind. in my life, i've been hurt a lot, karl, and uh, well, it's just taught me to be cynical, and to expect the absolute worst from people, and i don't want to live like that anymore, and when mike asked me to move in with him, i was just happy, just ridiculously happy. i mean, i still am and i want to go with that feeling. i love him and i love him! so i'm gonna expect the best from mike, and i know that he is gonna deliver that in return. okay?"
14184,Susan,zach killed her.
17313,Susan,aah!
17894,Susan,and i was just trying to be nice and give you a free pass for being such a big slut! edie!
14581,Susan,"well, you should care more about me. i'm your girlfriend. we're moving in together. he's just a neighbor. you don't even know zach."
14175,Susan,why do you even care?
16278,Susan,do you know something?
16279,Susan,"oh, my god. does this have something to do with orson's accident?"
15676,Susan,oh. are you all right?
18342,Susan,what?
15194,Susan,"after the embezzlement,lonny let the policy lapse.and now he's in jail,and i'm gonna die."
16784,Susan,"i know. i just-- think it's sweet that he worries about you, and i want him to feel like he's part of the decision making process."
17529,Susan,"to susan, the sweetest, most--"
16568,Susan,"well. i'm going to apologize, and then i'm gonna tell him that i made a huge mistake--"
17417,Susan,"yeah, he's upstairs waiting for you."
17738,Susan,"mm, i hate macadamia nuts. you think they're white chocolate chips until it's too late. stupid hawaii. who made 'em?"
16371,Susan,deep enough. come on! let's move!
16850,Susan,"great. okay, you pick first."
18052,Susan,mayfair. stay out of this. this is between me and my ex. got it?
16889,Susan,"well, maybe."
14244,Susan,he just wants to buy me a burrito.
17207,Susan,"well, before you go, i just want to say that, um--having you here these last few weeks-"
15060,Susan,"oh, you guys,we're all friends.this isn't something to get worked up over."
15131,Susan,"yeah,it's pretty troubling."
15801,Susan,nine.
16029,Susan,how long has rupert worked for you?
15465,Susan,lay it on me.
15959,Susan,what the hell's going on?
13915,Susan,"no. no, no, no. you obviously think you have some insight into my soul, so please, go ahead, dazzle me."
13653,Susan,i cannot believe julie sent you. she is soon going to be dead.
17271,Susan,oh! oh!
16905,Susan,andrew told us that you only said no--'cause you didn't want to impose.
17462,Susan,like you don't know-- jackson.
15990,Susan,"yes, and you will be poorly educated, and you won't get into college, and you will work for minimum wage for the rest of your life, all because of that boy! i hope you're happy!"
14742,Susan,"i should have told mike i saw zach. i'm a horrible person, right?"
15853,Susan,oh. but you're gonna be all right. and i'm gonna help you remember.
14146,Susan,"how could you? god, 'susan, do you trust me?' yes, of course i do. oh, i'm such an idiot, and you're such a liar. oh, and apparently a killer, and a drug dealer. that's just quite a personal ad you've got going there."
17431,Susan,oh. thanks. so i guess you met jackson.
14718,Susan,"yeah, but that doesn't mean we have to act like brother and sister. i mean, you bought me ribs. i have gratitude to express."
17839,Susan,"will you stop guessing? oh, god! why won't i just let myself be happy?"
17143,Susan,"oh, tim."
13535,Susan,what's that?
14810,Susan,bree! where have you been? we were starting to get worried.
17402,Susan,"hey, anytime that you need to talk, you just ring my bell--and wait."
16600,Susan,"well, what could be more important to you than my wedding?"
17889,Susan,really?
17943,Susan,"i've been too pushy. oh, please don't take it out on m.j.. he is such a bright kid. say something in spanish."
17992,Susan,"we already thanked her, buddy. let's not make her uncomfortable."
16443,Susan,"you need to move on, okay?"
18286,Susan,"aw, how sweet. and heavy. score."
14913,Susan,"wasn't it, though? you were fantastic!"
14847,Susan,"well, that's 'cause i assumed you were someone i would let in my house. what do you want?"
15037,Susan,"no, wait! wait! it's not what you think!"
16620,Susan,"oh? no.no, this is a big dramatic gesture."
16038,Susan,"hi, rupert! i went to the mall and bought a change of clothes for the weekend, and while i was there, i got something for you. i thought you could wear it on your day off. do you like it?"
15664,Susan,i can't accept this.i just--i gotta get out of this mess on my own.
15031,Susan,"this is ridiculous. what does she think, we're having an affair?"
14766,Susan,why?
14141,Susan,the stomach.
15589,Susan,"you sure that won't put a crimp in your, uh, dating life?you know, that girl you were at the movies with?"
17618,Susan,"so out of nowhere, jackson says, ""let's move in together."" i-i mean, of course i was stunned. and then when i said no, he just broke up with me. i mean, does he really expect me to be in love after just five months? that's crazy."
17071,Susan,"no need. i'll be quick. 'cause i'm sure you have a very good reason for giving mike pills when you know that he has a drug problem. so--what is your very good reason? okay, this may take a while. you might want to spit."
14231,Susan,"yeah. i just got out of this relationship with this guy, mike, and it's kind of complicated. anyway, i'm just not even sure where i am right now emotionally, i'm just all jumbled up and i don't think i could leap right into something new, relationship wise, you know, at the moment."
15987,Susan,"julie,that boy drinks,he steals,and now i find him mauling you on my couch?that's it.i forbid you to see him."
14485,Susan,"oh, i was just rude back there gloating and everything and i apologize."
18316,Susan,"yeah, um. did you say something to m.j. about going on that fishing trip?"
16861,Susan,"okay, back to charades."
13818,Susan,"well, why don't you enlighten me? you're beautiful, you have more money than you could spend, and you have a husband who adores you!"
16046,Susan,"listen, i know how you feel about jane, but if you could just give me a chance--i mean, come on, you can't possibly hate me this much, can you?"
16868,Susan,"oh, my god. and there i was, just bugging you about your doctor. i am so sorry. you should've just told me."
17831,Susan,"well--i wanna be with him, so--i think i have to."
13854,Susan,"oh, no good. my publisher's got me under the gun for something. what about friday?"
13888,Susan,thanks.
17480,Susan,"oh, sweetie. i know you're upset, but you'll feel better if you talk about it. and there's nothing you can't tell me. i'm your mommy."
16040,Susan,"well, let me help you, and we can talk. there is so much i wanna know about you. who is rupert cavanaugh? what makes him tick?"
16315,Susan,"no, it is. it's vittles. so, can i get you something to drink?"
17741,Susan,"i care because you mean a lot to me, and it makes me feel good knowing that two people have found love and happiness. so what's her name? who am i happy for?"
14234,Susan,"oh, edie. wait up, i, i want to ask you something."
16792,Susan,"uh, yeah, well, you know, sometimes you gotta hang tough."
17699,Susan,shut up.
13894,Susan,gotcha.
17644,Susan,can we start over?
14698,Susan,"well, why don't we put it to a test? julie, who would you rather have play with you?"
18180,Susan,we'd find a lot of traumatized cows.
16275,Susan,hey.
14427,Susan,do you think you can help me?
16356,Susan,i don't need to. i trust you.
17934,Susan,"um, i think you have been the most consistent male relationship in my life. you're so stable and reliable, and i just--always thought you'd be around. which is funny, because i don't really know anything about you."
14413,Susan,are you okay?
17804,Susan,you're welcome.
15601,Susan,"no, edie, wait.um, i don't wanna fight.i know that we've had our differences,but, you know, we had a friendship going there,and i just think we owe it to ourselves to talk about what happened."
14774,Susan,absolutely.
17999,Susan,"no, sweetie. we are just trying to figure out what is best for you. aren't we?"
13567,Susan,"uh, yeah. um. julie and i are just out tossing the frisbee around and it flew off into mrs. huber's back yard."
18147,Susan,"oh, hi, helen. ed. i would have introduced you, but once helen starts talking, she doesn't shut up."
17888,Susan,it's the way you are with men-- they're like tissues. you use one and then toss it away and then you're on to the next one. at least i'm looking for something real.
13555,Susan,"julie, i don't think they'll throw me in jail. i mean, it was an accident."
17834,Susan,"lee, that is not what i'm doing. is jackson perfect? no. but i don't think there is such a thing, and i have a history of sabotaging relationships. no, i'm doing this. i'm moving."
15539,Susan,hi. sorry.i'm just on the lookout for edie.
16565,Susan,bug.
16925,Susan,i think it's a sculpture.
16042,Susan,"okay, well, you certainly didn't have to go to all that trouble."
17499,Susan,"oh! wait. your forgot your whistle. okay, sweetie. this is just to be on the safe side. if juanita comes around, you just blow it. i'll be right there."
17559,Susan,"you know, why look for blame? kids fall. if you have to find fault, blame the pavement, not yourself--or me."
14504,Susan,"all right, what the hell are you up to?"
18418,Susan,"hey, mike, it's me. are you there? pick up. hello? okay, i know you're home. your lights are on. look, i really need to talk to you about something, uh, you know what? i'm just gonna stop by."
15295,Susan,what are you doing here?
18226,Susan,"you are not fine. how could you be? you have suffered a horrible loss. and you are allowed to feel any way you want. but i know that you are not fine. okay, well, i'm sorry for ransacking your house. i'll stop bugging you."
18014,Susan,"yeah, 'cause you make it like disneyland over here, with your paninis and your blackjack. you're trying to do everything you can to make him think that you're the other mommy."
18425,Susan,"well, i went over mike's to feed the dog."
14429,Susan,now?! are you drunk?
14388,Susan,you're welcome.
15769,Susan,"wow, is that shrimp?"
14792,Susan,"lonnie, how much financial trouble are you really in?"
15611,Susan,hi.
15033,Susan,"oh, so you want me to catch it for you? i mean, you, yourself, said she's crazy. i don't want to wake up tomorrow morning and find my tires slashed."
16258,Susan,"look, just to save you the embarrassment, ian's seeing someone."
18283,Susan,monday.
14103,Susan,is that blood?
13727,Susan,"good night, edie."
18213,Susan,"okay. you have a realtor coming, right? you cannot let him see the house in this condition. so just let me clean up a little. you won't even know i'm here."
17299,Susan,"i don't know what to tell you, mama. look at me. aah!"
14634,Susan,"so, i'm thinking we should keep it casual."
13354,Susan,"i've told julie a million times not to play in the kitchen. kids, y' know?"
17330,Susan,"oh, and rare, really rare."
15292,Susan,wow.wow.
16540,Susan,"hey, carlos! wait. hi. look, there's some crazy rumor going around that mike moved."
17036,Susan,pre-med? really?
15696,Susan,"hey, it's just me again. um-- when you got the invitation, i thought that you gave me the thumbs up, but i guess if that was actually-- some other type of finger gesture, uh-- well, i apologize for leaving you all these messages and wasting your time."
17155,Susan,i'm having a baby. i can't give birth with brittle bones. go!
16244,Susan,good luck with everything.
13433,Susan,how's bongo doing?
14844,Susan,"well, that's comforting to know there's a silver lining."
14142,Susan,what? what does that have to do with -
14468,Susan,but mike's lawyer pleaded self defence and if that's the case-
18346,Susan,"well, don't be mad at katherine. we all know that she just can't-- keep a secret."
17044,Susan,"oh, please, call me ""mom"". uh, because--that's what all the kids call me."
13332,Susan,"no, i'm just trying to remember. i don't wanna talk to you about my love life anymore, it weirds me out."
17852,Susan,i'm getting there.
13811,Susan,"oh, that's okay. i've got it."
14855,Susan,"oh, no, mom, stop! what is it?"
15564,Susan,"thanks, orson.thanks for coming.you know,you didn't have to do this."
14303,Susan,usually poker is more fun than this.
15770,Susan,ian!
13731,Susan,"oh, well, yeah, we, we did, uh, i just thought she left."
14187,Susan,i don't know.
17532,Susan,"so you're still gonna wanna hang out with us, even when you're totally fabulous, and we're still nobodies?"
18276,Susan,what?
18287,Susan,yeah. what?
17305,Susan,that was club soda. amniotic fluid doesn't have ice cubes and a lemon wedge.
18022,Susan,absolutely. anything else you need?
15129,Susan,okay.
13609,Susan,i'm sorry.
18379,Susan,"okay, sweetie. do you mind pulling over at the next rest stop?"
16812,Susan,hey. look who i picked up coming out of the movies-- a p.g. movie. is this the perfect teenager or what?
17844,Susan,"uh, bob--uh, lee did stay here last night. he slept on the couch--in the guest room. so you have nothing to worry about."
14375,Susan,yes! it is!
16264,Susan,yeah. i'll be having night terrors from now on--which i deserve.
16651,Susan,how are you doing?
15629,Susan,"oh yes! my god, i have a genius baby!!"
17965,Susan,"no. so i was going to take these and sell them to try to pay for it, and, yes, now that i'm saying it out loud, i hear how stupid that sounds."
17848,Susan,"oh, thank god. you know, when i woke up next to you yesterday, i just didn't know what to think."
13896,Susan,we've been divorced over a year.
15658,Susan,welcome to the neighborhood.
18321,Susan,what are you doing? i just told you i can't go.
15651,Susan,"oh, did i say that?"
13572,Susan,edie! i thought you'd be at work.
18032,Susan,"anyway, um, can't wait for the party. it's gonna be fun."
14921,Susan,what?
14282,Susan,i think i would have given up entirely if it weren't for you and morty.
15587,Susan,i'm sorry. did you just invite me to move in with you?
13752,Susan,"sounds like a job. so, julie said that you came by before?"
16736,Susan,well. we just all love ya.
15997,Susan,"before we begin, would either of you like some cookies, milk, lemonade, perhaps?"
15493,Susan,don't bother!i won't pick up.
17568,Susan,hi.
14148,Susan,julie? mommy needs a hug. julie?
15236,Susan,what are we gonna do about edie?
17235,Susan,so you don't know that your husband tried to kill mike?
15965,Susan,i would like to trade places with one of the people inside.don't-- don't you do that?
15784,Susan,hide pathetically in your room?
14695,Susan,"yeah, well, we've all seen your talent, which is a nice way of telling you why don't you put some curtains on your bedroom window?"
15062,Susan,zach is back!
14687,Susan,"oh. you have a little, uh, on your--"
17514,Susan,"he's a boy. that's my point! i know nothing about raising boys. and i think m.j. has figured this out, so he goes straight to mike whenever there's a problem."
14209,Susan,"see? now that's a lie, too, because there were plenty of right moments."
14228,Susan,are you asking me out on a date?
17473,Susan,"could you please take care of this guy? he's my friend, too."
16079,Susan,"oh, my god!"
16699,Susan,"aw,that's sweet.i don't believe you."
16528,Susan,where are you going?
13617,Susan,"still somebody broke in, it is a crime. so the weird thing is, the cop asked me out.on a date."
16981,Susan,"yeah, an evil person."
16761,Susan,"katherine, hi. oh, uh, i brought you that salad bowl."
16180,Susan,really?
14400,Susan,for julie's sake?
14764,Susan,i'll just call the agency and let them know i'm going with you.
17921,Susan,what--do--you--know?
17377,Susan,because i just freaked out about you leaving.
15841,Susan,i'll pick up my bags later.
16478,Susan,no.
15952,Susan,"listen, i have somebody in the car who's late for a plane. can you give me two minutes?"
14746,Susan,how?
13597,Susan,great.
15814,Susan,get out!
13881,Susan,not well. she accused me of not being a good mother.
14068,Susan,ooh. that place is so pretentious. i've been dying to go there.
16978,Susan,"uh, and how did you--"
17064,Susan,"wow. tape, batteries, a radio. how'd you know i need this stuff?"
13630,Susan,i dunno. what does that mean anyway? my life is complicated?
16192,Susan,see? it's just a tape.
18153,Susan,i can't forget something like this. helen is my very good friend.
16501,Susan,"can you imagine? i mean, finding out that two men you trusted bet you in a poker game. i mean, how demeaning is that?"
15609,Susan,bite me!
14852,Susan,"i don't know how i know this, but i, i think that he's in utah. he, he took a bus to bountiful. you have family there, right? okay, i gave him the bus fare."
17587,Susan,"no. no, don't go. that was very sweet of you to consider my feelings. you know what? you're hired."
13654,Susan,no.the cop lied to me.
17904,Susan,"hey, gaby, did you remember to get change? 'cause when i cash in my chips, i don't want to hear you say, ""all i've got is $50s."""
14318,Susan,mom. i brought her over.
13853,Susan,"no, me neither."
17864,Susan,what is wrong with you?
14607,Susan,"hey! karl, i see you. just stop right there!"
17066,Susan,you did? when?
15947,Susan,"no, no, i am not gonna spend your money."
17053,Susan,get out of my house. get him out of my house!
17182,Susan,especially when you get your big moment in the spotlight. bree gets to present an award to somebody who's done something extraordinary for the community.
15307,Susan,what the hell are you doing?
13922,Susan,what?
14477,Susan,mike and i got back together.
15836,Susan,"ian, can you please hurry?"
14042,Susan,they were having a very interesting conversation.
15460,Susan,"i'll just wait till the lights go out, and then i'll--"
15446,Susan,you're--sick!
14003,Susan,"i've been thinking about this for the last ninety miles and you don't have to forgive me. you can go to the police, kick me, you can burn my house down. you just have to know that i am so racked with guilt, i don't think it's possible for me to suffer any more than i'm already suffering."
15213,Susan,"hi.i thought you should know,i'm getting married."
15614,Susan,edie--
13396,Susan,but only i'm going. because you're gonna come down with something semi-serious that requires bed-rest and fluids.
15791,Susan,"me, too. so was that, uh, okay?"
16199,Susan,"oh, you know what? it wasn't till your rotten nephew came to town that julie was a perfect kid, and now she's lying and scheming and having casual sex! she's just a boob job away from being you!"
17794,Susan,or maybe you used your corkscrew as much in four months as most people do in a lifetime. ever think of that?
16676,Susan,is this about the wedding?
14140,Susan,no.
16422,Susan,dinner?
15653,Susan,"karl, what do you want?"
13979,Susan,"hey, edie!"
17460,Susan,"nothing. just, the answering machine lied to mommy."
13516,Susan,god bless you!
15867,Susan,edie?
14884,Susan,"oh, that's okay. julie's staying at a friend's tonight. you can sleep in her room."
16284,Susan,here. i'm gonna go get bree some flowers. i'll be right back.
15114,Susan,he needs to see me or he wants to see me?
13780,Susan,"well, you see, this bird, um, flew in your bathroom window, and, i, tried to save it, but, uh, it died."
18005,Susan,"well, i don't need you to do me any favors. what i need is for everyone to just stick the plan. monday, wednesday, friday--mike watches his son. he doesn't pawn him off on his girlfriend."
17169,Susan,"i don't understand you. is this something you do? you worm your way into a neighborhood with the promise of free tax preparation, and then you jump on the nearest middle-aged divorce?"
17807,Susan,so how is katherine's foot?
16716,Susan,"it's just that it's weird,you know,considering you're--where'd you go?"
17861,Susan,edie!
18265,Susan,"oh, i'm not mad at you. you know, i'm just disappointed in myself. i was a little lonely and a little afraid and--i just did what i always do--let some silly romantic fantasy take over."
17809,Susan,i can totally explain this. i swear.
17691,Susan,your what?
14023,Susan,right at my kitchen table.
15767,Susan,"well, it's nice to see you two getting along again."
18167,Susan,i can't help thinking about all the times edie and i sniped at each other. we could have been good friends.
14203,Susan,oh! oh! oh!
17180,Susan,"bree, that is, like, the best pie you've ever made."
13417,Susan,"that's a good idea. edie will get there at 5:45, which means her breasts will arrive at 5:30, so i should shoot for 5."
14024,Susan,"well, i'm glad you can laugh about this."
13358,Susan,he's spending the night?
16388,Susan,don't worry. happens to everybody. maybe it would help to talk about it.
15624,Susan,"i think i'm gonna have to pass.you know, i'm stronger than people give me credit for."
15247,Susan,i threw it out my car window somewhere on route 7.
15865,Susan,"oh, i'm just going to see mike delfino."
15349,Susan,i need you to ditch edie tomorrow night and have dinner with dr. ron and me.
13340,Susan,"oh, that're right."
16624,Susan,"no, i guess not."
16731,Susan,what if you change it back?
16754,Susan,i'm not sure. but there was something odd about the way they left.
15750,Susan,"that's a really lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story, is it?"
16078,Susan,"sweetie, we all wanna believe the best of the people we care about, but you cannot let your feelings for a man blind you to cold hard facts."""
17581,Susan,"uh, thanks."
13776,Susan,what is wrong with you? lassie would have had a fire truck here by now! stupid dog.
14583,Susan,you never asked me why zach wanted to shoot you. aren't you curious?
16733,Susan,i don't want you to be fine.i want you to be happy.
16021,Susan,oops!
16405,Susan,"well, i'm not used to guys bailing on me in the middle of foreplay."
13626,Susan,wow.
18015,Susan,you're trying to get your hooks deeper into mike by showing him how much his son loves you.
16660,Susan,"oh, i have an idea. i just got a lipstick yesterday. you could wear that."
14136,Susan,no.
17707,Susan,"hey, why did that guy hand you a cd?"
18229,Susan,"a few years ago, mike and i got in a car accident. a woman and her daughter--died."
13701,Susan,"i know, but i wanna look really sexy."
16058,Susan,"okay, well, give me a minute, and i will change into something nice."
18362,Susan,"well, if you do, we're gonna clean it and serve it up for dinner."
14121,Susan,julie!
15038,Susan,"carol, if you would just stop throwing things at me, i'll explain!"
17922,Susan,i didn't.
16927,Susan,"i don't mind it. not to brag, but i went to art school."
18095,Susan,"jessie, i-i am so sorry."
15120,Susan,"you mean,i'm not gonna see dr. ron?"
14204,Susan,"mike, it's not a good time. i'm a little drunk and a little freaked out."
14377,Susan,"no, mom, i'm not sad. and i'm not crabby. i'm devastated. and you keep acting like all i need is a couple of aspirin. morty was just one guy in a series of guys for you. and mike? he was the one. why don't you get that?"
15452,Susan,"okay,don't ""uh-huh"" me. you're not old enough to do that."
17328,Susan,"i think it's a beautiful way to honor your grandfather. i mean, ""james"" wouldn't be my first choice, but it's a good, solid name."
14716,Susan,"zach is your son,isn't he?"
16181,Susan,"oh, thank god. if you're not having sex, why were you talking about condoms?"
17865,Susan,i'm sorry. i thought we gave your latest breakup the three seconds of shock it deserved.
13671,Susan,"no, but i can tell you this much. he's not staying with relatives."
15345,Susan,"oh, yeah, that's the plan.i swear."
13389,Susan,"heh, well, and julie. uh, it's a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighbourhood, we invite them over for a home-cooked meal. sort of a tradition."
17825,Susan,oh!
17124,Susan,thanks.
16475,Susan,do you think she actually killed him?
17623,Susan,jackson? it's me. hello? that'll work.
17261,Susan,he's not feeling well. i see marisa isn't here either.
16289,Susan,"absolutely, yes!"
13392,Susan,oh. great.
13468,Susan,"i left three messages. oh, he's not gonna come. big surprise. i did everything but foam at the mouth. god, i hate when i get that way. it's like every time i get within 10 feet of karl, i just become this monster."
16201,Susan,"well, of course i freaked out. i'm a parent. you know, we hope that our children will wait to have sex till after we're dead."
14223,Susan,i think this is yours.
18200,Susan,"you, too."
14012,Susan,on my front lawn?
17251,Susan,"""hence."" that's classy. say a lot of ""hence"" when we see him."
16323,Susan,"yeah, well, with karl, i was more, ""divorce the ass and seize the assets."" so you better watch out. betrayal makes me vengeful."
13578,Susan,"edie, wait! um, you should take my ticket."
17270,Susan,"oh, well, good. thank you."
16799,Susan,"yeah, it's fine. would somebody just tell me where i can find--"
18183,Susan,i need four words.
13998,Susan,"well, edie, you're not that bad, and, and, and believe me, i'm, i'm not that good."
16848,Susan,you know what else is private? the parts of me that i'm pretty sure he snapped with his camera phone. i have a party to throw. i will deal with you later.
18230,Susan,"that's what we said--but it wasn't true. after the crash, i couldn't find my license. i had switched purses that night, and i had left it at home, and so--mike--told them that he was driving. he took the blame for me. so--i understand guilt. and i want you to understand that edie's death was an awful tragedy. it was not your fault."
16709,Susan,so you're back.how fun.i should have a brunch so that everyone can get to know you.
16882,Susan,"so there's, uh-- there's three of you. well, that must be-- cozy."
18114,Susan,"it's a head, and he's stabbing someone with a sword."
15152,Susan,yeah.sometimes it actually makes me a little nervous.
16721,Susan,"okay,whoa.i'm gonna stop you right there.i am way too young for that.please refer to your chart."
17918,Susan,"oh, well, on one hand, i got dumped for a pair of headlights named brandy. on the other, i reported karl's credit cards stolen, and cut the pockets out of all of his pants. so a little from column ""a,"" a little from column ""b."" sorry."
18214,Susan,"all right. i will be back after work to check on you. but until then, here's the phone, in case you wanna order chinese or--call a hotline or something."
18063,Susan,"all right, everyone. grab some clay. we're making vases."
14710,Susan,"the other day when i saw you making music with my family, i got a little jealous and i went a little crazy and i pushed you out. seeing you sitting here today, well, i can see how much you care about julie, and she comes first, and it should be you up there playing with her, not me. so i'm sorry."
16382,Susan,saying what?
15317,Susan,really?
18169,Susan,"oh, not now. we have a flat."
13461,Susan,"i could, but she's the one who threw it."
17805,Susan,you're welcome.
17690,Susan,and a damn good one.
16918,Susan,that's crazy.
13863,Susan,"i'm so sorry, i thought there was someone in the house."
14673,Susan,"it's karl's weekend to have julie, and they're always back by six. that's our custody agreement, back by six, and it's after six."
17331,Susan,"yeah. i said that, didn't i? oh, shoot. we can't do it. isn't your grandpa james significantly older than grandpa maynard? shouldn't we honor him first?"
14566,Susan,"we're not. it's a deterrent in case zach comes back. i told mike i didn't sleep last night, so he got me this sign. that guy is so supportive. you know he's out right now in a ride-along with the police searching for zach?"
17149,Susan,is this about the other day?
17011,Susan,oh!
14038,Susan,yeah.
14941,Susan,"mom, can i ask you a question?"
14156,Susan,"oh! i'm fine, it's good, you just, you know, uh, did, did you see - no! oh, good bye!"
15859,Susan,"at the car wash, whoa, whoa--"
18150,Susan,doing what?
17914,Susan,"hey, bree, i know what you can make for the wake--that flaky-breaded-shrimp thing."
14793,Susan,i'm gonna ask you a question and i want you to tell me the truth. did you steal from me?
13319,Susan,"i mean, of all people, did he have to bang his secretary? i had that woman over for brunch. gabrielle: it's like my grandmother always said, an erect penis doesn't have a conscience."
13352,Susan,"here, here, look. put in this peanut butter. and this cooking oil. and these olives!"
16857,Susan,"okay, go."
15911,Susan,"oh, right. oh, i wish paul young was still around. he'd know what to do."
15660,Susan,karl! what are you doing?
15401,Susan,"hey,edie.what's all this stuff for?"
15745,Susan,"and this is the, uh, spinal cord. and it, of course, attaches to the brain."
15461,Susan,"oh,my god!oh,thank you so much."
14080,Susan,thank you.
16933,Susan,"yes. quiet art is subjective. but you see, mike is working really long hours lately, and he can't s sleep with all that noise."
13908,Susan,hold on a sec.
14906,Susan,"oh, uh, julie, uh oh, julie, uh--"
14290,Susan,"alright, maybe you just feel that way because every year you get older and older."
16818,Susan,right. so can we go back to date night?
17381,Susan,really?
16552,Susan,why not?
16359,Susan,"what i'm trying to say is, there'll be no topic that i need to--skirt. no issue that i won't--address. i won't conceal my true thoughts under garments of secrecy."
14585,Susan,i didn't think you did. now tell me why zach does.
13677,Susan,"yes, i think so. i learned in college. it's like riding a bike, right?"
13326,Susan,"yeah, i get that a lot. here you go."
15149,Susan,wandering what?
16913,Susan,"you know what? don't worry about it. i'm gonna go inside and get us some water, and then we're gonna just keep looking."
15955,Susan,"i'm sorry. i know, julie picked a lousy time to rebel. i just can't fly off and ignore it."
15004,Susan,i just want a chance to get to know you.
15924,Susan,"oh, i'm so sorry that you had to see that."
17667,Susan,thank you--for a wonderful third date. and i'm glad that you're back on board with our plan.
17186,Susan,"pajamas--that's something you could do. okay, you're right. you're a guest in my housea completely naked guest in my house. i should leave."
14982,Susan,i don't know what you're talking about. i just came in to get a job.
13580,Susan,"i don't know what you're talking about, mrs huber."
13548,Susan,"well, before you move, we thought there was something you should know."
14600,Susan,"but i am so happy for you. really, you have a child, and that is good for you."
15655,Susan,mmmm.
15623,Susan,"i mean, that is after i get running water and electricity again--and a coffeemaker."
14990,Susan,"oh, okay."
14978,Susan,"well, i just want to change my life and every since i was a little girl i've always liked horses and the outdoors. well, i'm just fascinated with feed."
18300,Susan,canada.
14422,Susan,yes! that's my house!
17578,Susan,moving in? here?
14881,Susan,who is it?
16751,Susan,i'm julie's mom.
14154,Susan,oh.
16001,Susan,"look, you defied my wishes, you broke my rules. did you really think i was just gonna throw in the towel? face it. i outsmarted you."
14328,Susan,"yeah, i sympathise, i really do. but you have to take her back."
15621,Susan,"i know, but i can figure this out on my own.at least i'm gonna try.you know, i'm stronger than people give me credit for.i really am."
13801,Susan,"it helps, huh?"
14355,Susan,i have not been furious with you.
17972,Susan,i didn't know they were fake.
15751,Susan,a part of you feels like you'r cheating on her.
17206,Susan,"well, if you forgot something, you can just come back for it, or-- you could just not leave."
16096,Susan,"yeah. edie dumped him. okay, i know how this looks but i just feel bad. he's just a friend now."
17938,Susan,"well, let's just make sure we remember him."
17240,Susan,my god.
18021,Susan,"oh, yeah. i'm so excited. you got my rsvp, right?"
15077,Susan,we have an idea how to bring you and zach together.bowling.
14836,Susan,"mike, what are you doing?"
14930,Susan,you'd be an amazing mother.
13536,Susan,"well, that's not-"
15500,Susan,"oh, look, the baby's doing something really cute."
14961,Susan,is that him?
15951,Susan,"yeah, i wanna believe that, but suddenly you're having boys over, you're drinking beer--"
18077,Susan,"oh, that would be way too awkward. she's my boss."
15659,Susan,"julie, what are you doing?i'm trying to sleep."
14212,Susan,the police showed me your rap sheet!you killed the man!
15449,Susan,"okay,let's go. i don't wanna be late for the movie.oh,those are pretty.who sent those?"
17371,Susan,"uh, um, no, i-i haven't seen her."
15497,Susan,"oh, my god."
17527,Susan,"which is a good thing, 'cause there's a shark attacking the house."
17190,Susan,you most certainly were.
13388,Susan,do you wanna have dinner with me?
13541,Susan,"i just, ah, don't."
16095,Susan,"i mean, of course he's totally innocent. i'm just trying to help him find a lawyer."
13420,Susan,"john? your gardener, he gave you a rose?"
15151,Susan,"oh, um, well, uh,julie's staying at her father's house,and, um, i'm all alone here."
15643,Susan,"hey, what's going on?"
14829,Susan,i don't want my pie filling.
17800,Susan,what? i have never said a negative word about them dating ever.
14858,Susan,yes. mike.
16649,Susan,so this is what marriage is about? having someone to hide behind?
17870,Susan,gotta get out. i'm supposed to be meeting the moving company. what?
16456,Susan,wow. it's kinda hard to decide.
16549,Susan,"well, what else can i do? i love him. i have to go."
14311,Susan,"no, no it's just banged a little."
17773,Susan,"oh. well, you haven't. just treat him well, okay? he's a really good guy."
18330,Susan,"what's he gonna do with that, watch bruce lee movies without the subtitles?"
18279,Susan,"ah, fake marriages--they're complicated."
16308,Susan,yes!
13324,Susan,"oh, i wouldn't eat that if i were you."
14473,Susan,thank you.
16130,Susan,"oh, i so did not need to know that."
14394,Susan,"well, i was planning on doing that anyway."
16911,Susan,"oh, he will. come on. you gotta keep believing."
15556,Susan,"well,you keep telling yourself that.i know why you really paid that guy off.you still care about me."
16547,Susan,"yes. if i don't find mike before he's off that mountain, i may never see him again."
16554,Susan,why would i need a tent?
15364,Susan,"what were you thinking?oh,oh!"
16828,Susan,"yes. i am hosting a charades party, and all of my friends went out their way to insist i invite you."
17778,Susan,"sweetie, good news. katherine's gonna go to the zoo with you."
13512,Susan,"oh, no, she did not!"
13596,Susan,thank you! so do you think it should be dusted for prints?
14235,Susan,i was just wondering how you'd feel if i went out with bill.
13369,Susan,i brought some champagne. i thought we should all have a toast.
13684,Susan,oh!
13515,Susan,what's that?
18417,Susan,"thank you, zach. you have just made this really easy for me. you are now forbidden from seeing or talking my daughter ever again! and if you come within ten feet of her, i will call the police, and i will have you arrested! now get out!"
15112,Susan,"well,somebody has to do something,'cause i'm losing sleep."
15846,Susan,thank you.
15379,Susan,"oh,ron!oh! ugh!what the hell is wrong with you?"
13678,Susan,it's not big deal. it's just for a couple of hours. i let you borrow my eggs for a whole year.
14619,Susan,"what are you saying, that your father actually told you he was gonna be having a one night stand with edie britt?"
18146,Susan,"because we were starting to become friends and you like to run, and i like to--sit and--one of us had to give."
15701,Susan,you might think i'm naive but i know he's coming back to me.
13429,Susan,here's your dessert.
14443,Susan,"yeah, what did he say?"
17759,Susan,"all things we can discuss when i knock her teeth out with a pool cue. you know, it's sad when you can't trust a friend. or maybe the lesson here is that she wasn't really a friend to begin with then."
14953,Susan,"yeah, well, i know what r and r means. so what does this have to do with my father?"
15023,Susan,"addison, you just got caught paying for sex. now is not the time to wrap yourself in the flag."
14026,Susan,"well, i want to know that i am not the only one who is worried about this, and i want to know that if the two of them are over here, that they are going to be supervised, and i really want you to stop looking at me like i'm crazy."
15262,Susan,"you mean,like,marriage?"
15214,Susan,"no! no. ha!no, to-- to a gay guy.how did you know about the doctor?"
16479,Susan,i don't care.
15489,Susan,"no,just get out!get out!"
17321,Susan,like the deodorant?
16553,Susan,"well, it's my daughter's. uh, the whole junior class has them."
18317,Susan,"i wish i could, but i can't. i'm worried about jackson."
17126,Susan,"oh, well, you'll reel somebody in. you always do. you should have seen his last boyfriend--justin. he was so hot. you really had a thing for the young, ripped muscle boys, huh?"
16084,Susan,"still. it's tacky. well, okay then, uh--i'll help get you out. uh, what's your bail?"
17701,Susan,"why? oh, my god."
18093,Susan,"that is not true, and i think we are dangerously close to no longer speaking in metaphor."
13803,Susan,give me the dress.
13645,Susan,excuse me. i think i'm lost.
14875,Susan,"hi. okay, so i got the box on things you left on my porch."
17718,Susan,"""ever""? w-what do you mean ""ever""?"
13438,Susan,wow. you must be so relieved.
14623,Susan,what?
14335,Susan,**sigh**
14963,Susan,i can't believe this!
16168,Susan,yeah? so?
14807,Susan,not like that!
14513,Susan,we heard rex had a heart attack. how is he?
15939,Susan,"oh,i cannot believe your timing.i'm about to fly off to paris,and you're inviting boys over for oktoberfest."
15887,Susan,"well, yeah, i've been known to take a spill or two, but, you know, my doctor says it's an inner ear--wait, you remember that?"
15547,Susan,"are you sure?uh,i mean,you have such a long route,and that ice tea's gonna go right through ya.it's better here than mrs. mccluskey's hydrangeas."
16136,Susan,"i remember, and i guess that's enough for him. i'm sorry."
17445,Susan,"he could take me to court, and the judge can make me choose between you and my son. and i'm sorry. you will lose."
15137,Susan,"oh,no,no,no,no."
18059,Susan,"an evaluation? well, that is when someone judges your work and gives you a grade on it. but don't worry. i'm not doing that today."
13891,Susan,"well, i don't know how he had a heart attack. he was so young."
13708,Susan,"ooo, love that jacket. good choice."
17345,Susan,"well, of course, you don't. you're vanessa. you went through life with a beautiful name. that's why you have such a crackerjack personality."
14813,Susan,what?
14896,Susan,"you're, like, the first fourteen chapters."
16272,Susan,for the sake of our friendship--
18145,Susan,"okay, i lied. i hate running."
17717,Susan,"right, better feelings than you had about wives one, two and three?"
16020,Susan,"oh, it's also a disaster area. i didn't get a chance to clean it today."
16500,Susan,"family's terrific. seriously, you're just wasting your time here."
17050,Susan,"yeah, your friend. i told you last night he was coming by again."
14059,Susan,zach was telling julie about what happened to dana.
15527,Susan,me and karl?why would you think that?
14785,Susan,"well, i can't do that. you heard what he said about his wiring. i betrayed him. he'll never forgive me."
16860,Susan,"okay. well, i think it's time for a break."
18203,Susan,"dave, i know that you're going through hell, but edie was my friend, so please, let me help you. just a little."
16245,Susan,what do you think of this one?
13591,Susan,mr. whiskers!!!
14747,Susan,just to talk to you.
16329,Susan,were you also thinking of getting her a lace bra?
15041,Susan,"oh, no."
14872,Susan,"i just think if i start acting like an adult for once, maybe, who knows, somewhere down the line, mike and i at least can be friends."
15204,Susan,"wow, nice to meet you."
14756,Susan,do you know what i think? i think you were right. i think you should try to find your father first.
14910,Susan,"oh, julie."
18064,Susan,i'm so glad you could make it. i know i sprung this on you at the last minute.
16986,Susan,"at the motel. i slipped out without waking him. i've been up all night thinking, and i have something to say to you. i don't believe you. i don't believe that you could kill a man and not regret it."
13510,Susan,"oh, maybe until noon. then i'm going to have to run over there and beg him to love me ."
16412,Susan,i'm good.
13543,Susan,well th-
16099,Susan,so did you tell the police that you think orson killed monique?
15938,Susan,did you have any?
15565,Susan,"oh, it's nice to meet you."
15774,Susan,ian.
15973,Susan,the last thing i said to her was that she disappointed me.
17710,Susan,"hey, you two. what's going on?"
14995,Susan,"oh, that's funny. so, all the times you were cheating on her, that was okay, but having lunch with your daughter, that just crosses the line? i just want a chance to get to know you."
15517,Susan,uh-- sure.
15103,Susan,it's my mental health.my mental health!you took an oath.
16958,Susan,"okay. my aunt ella has arthritis. i have two cousins with webbed feet, and there's a whole lot of third nipples on my dad's side."
13589,Susan,"cats can open drawers, can they?"
16154,Susan,it may be a little late for that.
17960,Susan,"exactly. and so even though i was already halfway to the airport, i turned around and i came home, and, yep, i had left the garbage disposal on. so ever since then, i always check."
16391,Susan,and why don't you put your water on that lower shelf?
14386,Susan,how? are you going to give me your corneas?
18008,Susan,"no, we do not have any provolone."
16378,Susan,"and our cheese! ian, can you believe it? mike saved our cheese!"
13445,Susan,"hello, sorry i'm late."
17432,Susan,"oh, clearly this is not how i would've wanted the two of you to meet. he's--he's really a nice guy."
18280,Susan,"no, no. it's okay. i wanna do this. truth is--i miss you, and the house has been kinda lonely since you left."
14579,Susan,"he held a gun to my face, so i'm thinking, good."
15113,Susan,super.
16763,Susan,"you know, the one that you left so suddenly for."
16219,Susan,"oh, come on. mike needs a great lawyer. zach can afford a great lawyer."
16092,Susan,don't worry. dinner's all taken care of. we're having blanquette de veau and a grand marnier souffl.
16474,Susan,"oh, that's right. she babysat your kids."
17619,Susan,"it's susan. and he was the first one to say he didn't want to get serious, which is why i was happy. we were just having fun."
14524,Susan,i just really think we need to give it to the police.
15444,Susan,this is insane!
16276,Susan,"i just heard from andrew what happened. i had to come see you. if you want me to go, uh--"
15327,Susan,"aw,that's so sweet.you came all the way down here just for me."
18429,Susan,"hi. hi, yeah, i'm here."
14214,Susan,i know.
18270,Susan,"you want people to think this is a real marriage, don't you?"
18070,Susan,"getting to know each other better. oh, napkins."
17312,Susan,um--sorry. go on.
14712,Susan,"yeah, well, i try."
15797,Susan,huh?
16355,Susan,"okay, i'll sign it."
13614,Susan,"hey,mike."
13682,Susan,and a lot less sneaky.
13562,Susan,"oh, i am so glad to be playing frisbee again. here you go, coming atcha."
14363,Susan,"yeah, it can be rewarding."
15308,Susan,i am not!
15563,Susan,i don't deserve friends like you.
16117,Susan,you would do that for mike?
16184,Susan,"don't say ""uh-huh"" like that.julie wouldn't lie to me.if she says she's not having sex,then she's not having sex."
14227,Susan,lunch?
16200,Susan,"don't worry, i'm not gonna get mad. just sit down. you know what upset me the most? that you didn't trust me enough to tell me the truth."
18353,Susan,"good. that's all i needed to hear. well, i hope that you will be very happy together."
18285,Susan,"well, uh, we wanted you two to be the first to know, and we should probably get going. got a few more neighbors to shock."
15685,Susan,"oh, there he is."
17123,Susan,"hey, everybody. i'm sorry to interrupt, but the smell of that apple pie just made my mouth water."
17354,Susan,"well--i hate the name ""maynard."""
17163,Susan,"i know, but this visit was really more for julie."
15223,Susan,is there a problem?
16896,Susan,"hey, i would've made them myself if i knew how. honestly, i'm a good neighbor."
13665,Susan,"hey, paul."
17140,Susan,are you always this sarcastic with your clients?
17875,Susan,edie--
17233,Susan,mike says i need to forgive orson--
17662,Susan,"and so that's when i got caught stuffing at the pep rally. and six months later--kaboom. i was voted prom queen. nice work, girls. stop that right now."
17179,Susan,no.
13557,Susan,oh god. i hate that i'm turning you into a thief.
16174,Susan,"oh! i was just, uh--i lost an earring."
15989,Susan,"well, then you won't go to school. i'll home school you."
13892,Susan,"oh no, i'm sure she's fine. we're talking about mrs. huber. she's like a roach!"
15443,Susan,are-- are you saying--that you're gonna go through with this wedding--unless i tell you not to?
18069,Susan,he decided to shack up with my best friend. and people wonder why i'm through with men.
17267,Susan,thank you. which cousin?
18343,Susan,"okay, katherine, that is--it's totally unfair to mike. i mean, he needs to know the truth."
16331,Susan,"so, uh, what won't you ask me?"
16530,Susan,"what? but just ten minutes ago, we were making plans, and you were saying how great we were gonna be together."
16582,Susan,is that all you have to say?
14033,Susan,what's paul doing here?
17375,Susan,i want to be able to reach you this summer when you're doing that internship.
16093,Susan,five-thirty. but i am rewarming it all by myself.
16573,Susan,"okay, north. i need north. moss grows on the north side of trees."
14093,Susan,"well, i could see why you would be."
14773,Susan,you must be so relieved.
16742,Susan,"adam,i have no idea what you're talking about."
18106,Susan,"and now i'm ignoring you and moving on to evan. hello, evan."
15688,Susan,"karl, we are not getting back together.not ever. you need to just stop and realize that it's over.i'm gonna marry mike.so i need you to sign these because i have to be divorced first."
16982,Susan,"well, i don't see one."
17975,Susan,can't say no.
14340,Susan,what are you doing?!
14445,Susan,what about dana?
18294,Susan,"yeah, i'll try. don't think he's not gonna want his gift back. and it's really heavy, too."
16517,Susan,you are so dead.
18134,Susan,"okay, i was thinking of stories that put edie in a positive light."
17049,Susan,my matchmaking skills. julie and barrett are really hitting it off.
15381,Susan,"i can see that.so,what,did you run out of strangers to beat up on the street,and you're going house to house now?"
17871,Susan,so now me wanting to be with the man i love is stupid?
18009,Susan,"absolutely not. in this house, we do not eat pretentious cheeses. we eat honest american peanut butter. now watch your movie, and i'll be back in a minute."
15413,Susan,"wait until i leave to tell her,'cause she's gonna kill me."
13920,Susan,"well, you know what? you're going to come to julie's party tomorrow night, and you're gonna see karl and i together, and you're going to understand once and for all that i have no feelings for him whatsoever."
17142,Susan,"yeah, i was sorry to hear about your job. you know, ever since n.a.f.t.a., corporate outsourcing has been the bane of the american worker. is that right? i heard somebody say that on n.p.r., and i just keep repeating it to people."
15953,Susan,i am so disappointed in you.
17711,Susan,"oh, i just love this song. and jackson doesn't like to dance, so--isn't this fun?"
15942,Susan,"well, a simple no, i didn't drink any beer' would've sufficed."
13750,Susan,"knock, knock!"
14502,Susan,oh yeah? when your father was cheating on me i used to follow him all the time. i know my stuff. there he is.
15030,Susan,"oh, hi, alberta. how are you? were you the one that sent out those neighborhood watch pamphlets? i was wondering if maybe you had any extra copies. or i'll just borrow one from somebody else. thanks."
16282,Susan,"ian! ian, you're not gonna believe this. bree just told me she can prove mike's innocent."
16374,Susan,"okay, don't panic. just grab onto my neck, and i'll swim for the both of us."
13503,Susan,please. call me susan.
13317,Susan,"yeah, and then he got this zen look on his face, and he said, you know susan, most men live lives of quiet desperation."
14770,Susan,"oh, my god. lonnie, did you move some of my money?"
15426,Susan,"karl,this marriage--our marriage,this fake marriage,that's what it is,right?fake."
18210,Susan,oh. uh--okay. sure.
18239,Susan,"yeah, and a total shark. the worst thing about our divorce was that i couldn't hire him to represent me."
18411,Susan,issues? what kind of issues do you think i have?
14820,Susan,"yeah, it did."
17641,Susan,okay. when?
15713,Susan,hi jane.
16063,Susan,"absolutely. so, i assume this means they know about me?"
16303,Susan,thanks.
15174,Susan,thank you.
18282,Susan,we're getting married.
14510,Susan,"oh, mary alice, what did you do?"
17077,Susan,what?
16440,Susan,"well, there's this guy coming to dinner, and he is single and handsome and charming and--"
17022,Susan,i wanna believe you. it's just--
18170,Susan,we don't have time for this. anybody know how to change a tire?
13312,Susan,"well, sometimes people are so unhappy they think it's the only way they can solve their problems."
17296,Susan,"well, the next time she tries to help, she's gonna get an old-fashioned in her face, so you better step up and start defending me."
15879,Susan,"uh, just a little jaunt down memory lane."
16684,Susan,"reverend, that was such a beautiful ceremony. really, just heartfelt and moving--the whole package."
17374,Susan,"well-- we all lie to our kids sometimes, right?"
16178,Susan,sex kills!
16560,Susan,"no, no. i'm invigorated. this fresh mountain air is--aah!"
16621,Susan,no. they're my flowers! enjoy your stolen wedding!
14702,Susan,i did not kick edie out. julie made that call.
16146,Susan,"bree, hi. sorry about that. damn telemarketer. so what can i do for you?"
14264,Susan,what does that mean?
15789,Susan,"wow, my heart is pounding."
15910,Susan,ahh. that's nice. so where were we?
15026,Susan,"oh, my god. stop. right now. i'm gonna go pay this thing."
18215,Susan,"hey, katherine, can you call me back as soon as you can? i just left dave, and he's in bad shape. i actually think that he might be--oh, crap. i gotta go."
14591,Susan,"zach is your son, isn't he?"
18216,Susan,"yes, officer?"
13600,Susan,you noticed that?
15825,Susan,i love this music. what's it about?
17073,Susan,"by giving pills to an addict? does that sound helpful to you, mrs. kowalsky?"
17997,Susan,"hey, thanks. let me remind you that the reason i agreed to custody is so our son could spend time with his father."
14546,Susan,"look, zach. i know you're upset. let's just, let's just sit down and talk."
16397,Susan,"well, that's okay. you gotta work, you gotta work. so, um--i was thinking about london. julie's gonna be applying to college as soon, and, um, a year abroad could give her a real boost. so--let's do it."
16999,Susan,"oh, honey. you'd be surprised how fast the best schools fill up. and only the best for our kid, right?"
15318,Susan,"oh,yeah,i'll be surprised.so i guess we have the whole insurance thing worked out."
13395,Susan,julie? mike delfino just invited us to dinner friday night.
18399,Susan,try not to scare m.j. when you bring him here.
15554,Susan,"hi. i made you a thank-you pie,and by ""made,""i mean ""bought."""
15928,Susan,bless you. mmm. so what else happened?
15871,Susan,"oh, that's my mac and cheese. don't change the subject. what have you been telling him about me?"
16066,Susan,"okay, i guess it's time we have the conversation. ian, haven't you ever wondered why i've never cooked for you?"
17981,Susan,"m.j., why aren't you dressed? we're gonna be late for our first day of school."
17285,Susan,"no, no. it's fine, adele. mama."
18236,Susan,"oh, not necessarily. i hear they're getting divorced, and it's gonna get ugly."
18310,Susan,"please, can't this wait? we're about to get married."
14415,Susan,i'm so sorry.
15983,Susan,"oh, let it go. we came home because i was worried about you, and with good reason. you, put on your shirt and get out."
15914,Susan,"oh, i just thought of something. i'm never gonna celebrate a fifty-third wedding anniversary. i'd have to live into my nineties. oh, my god. i'm gonna die."
16713,Susan,"i-i didn't know you were,this kind of doctor."
14379,Susan,"you're so cute, yeah."
18065,Susan,"oh, well, keep looking, 'cause i don't cook, and shanghai panda delivers."
16041,Susan,"oh, isn't the master bedroom down that way?"
18336,Susan,"no, i need to talk to mike. now you could flush the toilet and try to get him out there."
17557,Susan,"oh, he's fine."
14869,Susan,"actually, i think i'm starting to feel pretty zen about the whole thing."
14678,Susan,i'm sorry. what?
14558,Susan,thanks.
16691,Susan,"oh, you might wanna check that breast pocket of your suit."
15477,Susan,no?
14286,Susan,what? why?
16637,Susan,"you and me? oh! well, i-i'm beyond flattered. i-i find you to be an incredibly attractive woman. i just--"
16104,Susan,"if you're so sure that orson is innocent, why don't we go through his things? where's his desk?"
15160,Susan,"oh! mmm.okay, that sort of felt unethical."
16785,Susan,do you wanna go or not?
15806,Susan,"to bed, alone. you know, it's something that i've always wanted to try, but i've just never gotten around to."
17145,Susan,done catching up. all about accounting now.
15362,Susan,so you sent him over to mike's?
14376,Susan,"yeah, i do and that's what makes me so crazy. the difference between you and i, that you could be heartbroken and you can just move on and i am just broken."
13991,Susan,do you need help with the container?
15771,Susan,what are you doing here?
16994,Susan,"oh, yeah!"
13965,Susan,"good news. i finished my book, so i thought to celebrate, you could take me out to lunch."
14915,Susan,maybe.
15003,Susan,you do that.
14965,Susan,apparently he owns the place.
15230,Susan,"we got to the altar,but the whole fake wedding thing sort of imploded."
15995,Susan,how can you be so calm about this?
17959,Susan,i'm going crazy 'cause i think i left my front door unlocked. could you run and check? i'll stay on the line.
16687,Susan,you were great.
17336,Susan,"i know. it's terrible, but i can't change it now. mike was so emotional about it."
15146,Susan,i love sushi.i'm available tomorrow night.
17550,Susan,yeah. i think it's just beginner's luck. uh-huh.
15361,Susan,where's he going?
14418,Susan,what?
17886,Susan,that is not much of a distinction.
13972,Susan,"oh. so, she must have written a lot of things in them?"
15689,Susan,"no, he was going to, but then you clocked him in the mouth with a salad shooter, remember? actually, i'm going to pop the question to him tomorrow night."
15163,Susan,you?
15576,Susan,"this is not what we should focus on right now.the point is, you maliciously set fire to my house."
13494,Susan,i was thinking we left too late.
14870,Susan,"no, i came between the man and his son. there's a huge betrayal. i, i can't even blame him for hating me."
14408,Susan,she changed her name because of her aunt? that just doesn't seem like something mary alice would do.
15962,Susan,carolyn! open up! my daughter's inside!
14835,Susan,"mike, paul young is back. look."
14665,Susan,"well, she was gloating about sleeping with you, and i just wanted to shut her up."
17213,Susan,"in honor of you coming home, we are making your favorite meal - steak and mashed potatoes."
17508,Susan,i was trying to teach her not to be a bully--something she should have learned from her mother.
17013,Susan,"oh, but this isn't the same thing. mike wouldn't lie to me about this."
14102,Susan,get out.
17325,Susan,"me, too. oh, you finally have a name. dr. conner delfino."
16677,Susan,but we didn't agree on this. maybe i can scale things back a bit.
16661,Susan,"okay, it's your big day, so i'm gonna let that slide."
17610,Susan,"no, it wouldn't."
17752,Susan,"of course, even though i still think you're beautiful just the way you are."
18084,Susan,"i thought it was gonna rain. okay, um--i'm not gay."
18011,Susan,what is he doing here?
16233,Susan,"i'm just stunned. so i guess they worked it out, right?"
17201,Susan,"well, maybe it's because you just saw him. he must be on your mind."
17385,Susan,"okay, just listen to me."
18386,Susan,"we're playing a game with dave, okay? so run as fast as you can."
15402,Susan,a surprise?
15028,Susan,"thursday, coffee at two. be on time."
17730,Susan,someone's coming!
14433,Susan,you gave her your dead wife's ring?
17337,Susan,"well, i'm not sure that the world war ii argument is gonna fly."
15045,Susan,"well, let me see. painting in the rain or letting the whole world think i'm a whore? i don't know. what do you think?"
14761,Susan,oh?
16449,Susan,great.
14942,Susan,"oh. oh. i was just researching my book and i, i found the strangest thing. no one with my father's name was ever a merchant marine."
16167,Susan,things are different now! i-i love you! you--you don't have to worry about that anymore. if we're gonna make this relationship work then you have to trust me and why are you smiling at me?
17463,Susan,really? whose is this?
16345,Susan,"so i guess this means we're babysitting the kids, huh?"
18268,Susan,i'll help you.
15630,Susan,oh hi.i have a normal baby.
15389,Susan,"i did remarry my ex,but it was only because he has great health insurance."
17269,Susan,"oh, okay."
14674,Susan,"well, see? there you go."
14672,Susan,you walked out on me.
17673,Susan,the forehead?
15395,Susan,"her,too."
15271,Susan,she found the ring and the prenup in your briefcase.she thought you were gonna pop the question tonight.
15982,Susan,because you're british.
16623,Susan,she said that i would make mike wish he was back in a coma.
17277,Susan,i don't have one.
16814,Susan,"you know, this perfect teenager thing is really starting to chap my ass."
14997,Susan,is that what you think of me? i'm a mistake?
13402,Susan,it's not like that. the more the merrier.
13520,Susan,oh.
15582,Susan,i need edie to spill her guts.what do you know about wearing a wire?
18249,Susan,i'm taking her to the doctor so he can perform a little procedure.
13816,Susan,how can you call something like this harmless? after everything you know about what i went through with karl?
15958,Susan,i'm sorry.
17492,Susan,"gaby, we have a problem. i just saw juanita push m.j. down."
16877,Susan,"oh, we haven't gotten a chance to meet. i'm susan. i live next door. oh! jeez."
17722,Susan,"well, putting a wall around your heart doesn't protect you. it just keeps people out. i learned that the hard way. now with jackson--i remember that i like feeling hopeful. i like believing in ""happily ever after."" i really wish that you felt that way, too."
13777,Susan,"good boy, bongo! run, bongo, run, go get help!"
17225,Susan,"do you hear me, orson?!"
15074,Susan,"i think he should spend some time with decent role model,don't you?"
15586,Susan,"yeah. i'm sort of up against the wall.the insurance company needs proof fast,and things are sort of weird at bree's.i don't wanna over stay my welcome."
16696,Susan,happy one-month anniversary.
15126,Susan,"oh,oh,no,i don't think that's necessary."
14336,Susan,"i just keep thinking it's coming, millie, and i can't stop it."
14708,Susan,"well, i hope it wasn't as ugly as me and karl."
15810,Susan,"oh, no, i don't mean to break the flow, but i just, um--look, i know that i'm only your second lover ever, and that, i, i know that means a lot, and i just don't want it to mean--too much."
13995,Susan,"i know, i know. mrs. huber was a good friend to you."
15237,Susan,she'd kill us both.
14100,Susan,"what, what does this mean?"
13507,Susan,we've all sort of felt it.
14853,Susan,why don't we both stop getting divorced? that would be a nice family tradition.
17247,Susan,"oh, no, no, no, th-those are not the legs of a law professor."
14371,Susan,and your idea of helping is to let tim just grope you?!
14153,Susan,"oh, um, is my daughter under there?"
17448,Susan,really?
13441,Susan,"this is for you. no, for bongo. you give it to him."
16470,Susan,"get out. there will be no kissing,and there will be no wedding."
14556,Susan,"oh, god! oh, there's blood."
17982,Susan,he's sick. i'm late. thanks for helping.
18312,Susan,can't this wait? we're about to get marry.
14697,Susan,"she did not pick you. it just didn't occur to her that i would agree to do it. well, now she knows, and if she had it to do over again, she'd pick me."
14391,Susan,"no, no. what do you want?"
14280,Susan,"well, it's true."
14247,Susan,"i can't believe edie. she doesn't have dibs on every man on the planet. if i want to go out with bill, i should be able to."
17785,Susan,i'm sorry. the--the image in my mind is probably way funnier than what actually happened. why did m.j. do that?
14733,Susan,"have you seen this boy? hey, missing kid. anyone? going once, going twice--"
16288,Susan,it always is with you.
13831,Susan,what?
16287,Susan,i heard you talking to carlos. now answer the question.
14252,Susan,"bill, um, i have my reasons."
14275,Susan,let's go.
17287,Susan,"oh, my god."
16176,Susan,why were you two talking about condoms?
14598,Susan,"so naturally you'll be wanting to have a relationship with him, and that, that takes time, a lot of time."
14432,Susan,"ah, morty. i just don't think it's going to happen. she's moved on. why don't you sit down, i'll call you a cab."
16239,Susan,hey. you're back.
16098,Susan,"hi, ladies!"
14196,Susan,are you okay?
18154,Susan,"she is annoying, and i hide when she knocks on my door, she does not deserve for you to be wrecking her marriage."
14999,Susan,my name's susan. i was buying some horse feed when mr. prudy had an attack behind the counter. i gave him cpr and called nine-one-one.
13560,Susan,wear these. i don't want you to leave any fingerprints.
14605,Susan,"zach is your son,isn't he?"
13858,Susan,come over and help my find my pilot light.
17288,Susan,i can't believe she made a play for orson.
13373,Susan,"gabby, the woman killed herself. something must've been going on."
13650,Susan,"oh,thank god. listen, don't ask any questions, just get somebody down here to pick me up at the corner of ninth and foster."
14864,Susan,"no, mike, mike! come back! come back!"
17132,Susan,"no. i'm pregnant, and my husband's in rehab, and the only reason i seem sane is because you're here, making my house feel like a home."
17408,Susan,i don't know. later. just go.
15301,Susan,as opposed to the 12 i wasted on you?why are we talking about this?i don't recall asking you your opinion.
17085,Susan,it's okay.
15458,Susan,"well,i definitely pickedthe right person to sit next to.actually,is this seat taken?"
14530,Susan,he's a good person.
18121,Susan,would this seem any less shocking if i told you we were once married for 12 years?
14246,Susan,"so what then? if you can't have him, nobody can?"
18398,Susan,i'm not leaving m.j.
16337,Susan,"mike, it wasn't a movie. that was us."
17851,Susan,because--he loves me.
16753,Susan,"i know it sounds weird, but julie says dylan does not remember anything about living here."
17817,Susan,"i'm sorry. if you're interested, i have dirt on bree."
16979,Susan,i just don't see how he could not feel bad about it.
16782,Susan,"shh! jeez! ooh, mike's in the other room."
18435,Susan,"shh. not in front of mike! oh, look, mike. ian brought you flowers. i'll just go put them in some water."
17367,Susan,"well, the first thing off the top of my head--uh--we can't afford it."
15309,Susan,"oh! yeah,oh--no,no,he just said that 'cause we used to be married.it's just a force of habit."
17218,Susan,"maternity lingerie - ah, right. why don't they just call it what it really is? a pup tent to hide your stretch marks."
17795,Susan,hi.
14977,Susan,"why, cause i went to college?"
15752,Susan,it's all right. 'cause i feel guilty too. that's why we should just stop this right now because it's all way too complicated and i think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
16252,Susan,"oh! no, i wanna, um, keep a low profile."
14573,Susan,no.
15827,Susan,i'd love to go to france someday.
15687,Susan,"karl, we've been through a lot together.we will always be connected by julie, but-- i know why you bought me that house, and i'm not moving into it."
18178,Susan,we thought you might wanna scatter them somewhere.
13848,Susan,no.
14333,Susan,absolutely.
15743,Susan,"well, yes, and how nice that would have been, huh? um, but, no, no, i'm a brain specialist."
15053,Susan,that was a good one.
13603,Susan,okay.
13446,Susan,really?
17724,Susan,jackson-- he's in the bathroom.
18006,Susan,"okay, lunch and movie. you are one lucky boy. i'm gonna take a quick shower. try not to get any crumbs on the couch. what's wrong? it's peanut butter, no crusts your favorite."
13374,Susan,"oh mary alice, what did you do?"
14850,Susan,but he's not here. i swear.
13384,Susan,mike!
15097,Susan,oh! oww! oh!
16072,Susan,"so i'm cooking dinner for ian's parents tomorrow night, and it's the first time i'm meeting them, so i sort of wanna impress them."""
15464,Susan,"now i'm absolutely horrified that i'm about to say what i'm about to say,but there's nobody else i can talk to who won't judge me.and since you're a complete stranger, i'll probably never see you again unless i randomly run into you on the street,in which case,you'll ignore me'cause you know how crazy i am."
17457,Susan,"he has a name for it? okay. that's it. you and mike are not hanging out anymore. and this little wednesday ""potato skins and susan sex tips night""? i forbid it. did mike mention he likes having his toes sucked? oops! that just slipped out."
17040,Susan,"oh, sure. i have to check on the laundry."
15533,Susan,"hey! hey,you,wait,wait,wait. um--okay,you cannot tell edie about this.whatever she's paying you,i'll pay you double."
17731,Susan,hi!
15269,Susan,karl. karl!come here!why didn't you answer your damn cell phone?
17184,Susan,"orson, you scared me. why are you sitting down here in the dark? and aren't you a little cold?"
17468,Susan,apology accepted.
15518,Susan,"oh, it's still a little red,but i think i got all the hot sauce out."
13593,Susan,"well,i'm the one who discovered the break in and i think i found some evidence."
15548,Susan,"great! oh,the one down here is broken.why don't you use the one upstairs?it's right off my bedroom."
17640,Susan,"uh, yeah. i think i remember you."
15800,Susan,ian!
16206,Susan,"this is your new lawyer, alan marcus. alan, this is mike delfino."
16189,Susan,you found it?
17389,Susan,amazing.
17929,Susan,"oh, yeah. he's a great guy. i just, uh, want to be alone right now."
17424,Susan,"oh, good. mmm. okay, you have fun, sweetie."
15138,Susan,i am so sorry.but i'm not sick.
17814,Susan,did we?
15833,Susan,"oh, it's julie. i have to. hello? what's up? hey. uh, i can't, no, can you say that again? the signal's really bad. what? oh, my god."
14046,Susan,"oh, of course. i assumed as much."
13356,Susan,it's upset?
16365,Susan,really?
15098,Susan,it was an accident.
14123,Susan,"oh, don't write that down. oh, but this is good. you can let mike go. he's innocent."
13829,Susan,what is wrong with you?
16816,Susan,"i'm sorry. you gotta understand, for so long, it's just been julie and me, and i've made all the decisions alone. you felt so strongly."
13869,Susan,thank you.
18413,Susan,i love him. you can write that in your little book.
15584,Susan,"oh, okay."
16998,Susan,and how does danielle like her baby brother?
18103,Susan,karl. what are you doing here?
17621,Susan,how much am i paying you?
14719,Susan,what's wrong?
15091,Susan,and there were the noises.
15475,Susan,it is?
18388,Susan,"okay, listen. it's really important that you win this game. so i want you to find a good hiding place, and even if you hear dave, you don't come out no matter what, okay? okay? don't worry. i'm gonna hide, too. now go. go!"
13533,Susan,what?! i am not desperate.
15641,Susan,"i really don't, tom.is everything okay?"
15761,Susan,he was the only suspect.
14448,Susan,"actually, before you go i need you to check into someone else's background. there's this plumber i know?"
14357,Susan,what?
14554,Susan,"uh, hello! uh, he was waiting there for you to come home so he could kill you."
18233,Susan,wow.
16697,Susan,"well,we've just been so happy the last four weeks,i thought we should celebrate."
16737,Susan,"damn it,lynette. what did we say after mary alice.after edie? why didn't they tell us?"
17561,Susan,jason taught him to ride the bike.
15039,Susan,"no, i'm not screwing him! he's my father!"
16811,Susan,"well, you're right. i'm an adult, and i need to be honest about these things, and i will be--starting tomorrow."
17772,Susan,no--and i think it's great.
13464,Susan,"oh, sorry. was that petulant too?"
13875,Susan,julie!
13912,Susan,"no, no! it's fine. it just kind of caught me off guard. i mean, i want to say it back."
14177,Susan,not my type.
17058,Susan,yeah.
13838,Susan,"honey, what's going on?"
14081,Susan,i am so sorry! is everyone okay?
13346,Susan,uh-- i have a clog.
15326,Susan,"mike!oh,wait,stop! go back!stop! stop a second.hey!what are you doing here?"
14658,Susan,"not if you're sucking my exhaust, you won't."
16640,Susan,that's good to know.
16932,Susan,"i was just wondering, um, do you think you could move it to your backyard?"
16657,Susan,yeah. i feel really good about this.
18118,Susan,"okay, will someone call guinness? because you just set the world record for the biggest load of crap in one sentence."
16888,Susan,"mike, they live 15 feet from us. if we have a fire, i wanna be sure that they like us enough to call 9-1-1."
18107,Susan,"evan, why don't you head into the classroom? i need to talk to your daddy, and i may need to use some grown-up words."
14788,Susan,"lonnie, are you here? it's susan. lonnie?"
14911,Susan,"oh, now i feel really awful."
17007,Susan,"bree thinks you're doing drugs. she found this on her kitchen floor, and it's not aspirin."
17292,Susan,i'm doing what now?
16826,Susan,aw! you have to come. you're the best charades player i know.
13544,Susan,"what exactly is it you want from me, mrs huber?"
14803,Susan,"well, i'm sorry, but you have."
14428,Susan,morty? what are you doing?
13327,Susan,"susan mayer, i live across the street."
15874,Susan,what?!
18056,Susan,"now as you listen to the music, see what pops into your head. what shapes does it make you see? what colors are you thinking of?"
17154,Susan,mm. hmm. mm. tim! where's that milk?
14163,Susan,i'm sure. now go.
14802,Susan,wow.
15764,Susan,this is your day. you can push the ceremony back an hour. now get that detective on the phone and talk things out with orson.
18204,Susan,you sure you don't want one? it's really good.
14118,Susan,what day was that?
15736,Susan,i think i will have the mescaline salad.
13904,Susan,uh--
16527,Susan,i know.
14014,Susan,what is going on here? were you just kissing my daughter?
16270,Susan,"i hadn't really thought a lot about this moment,but when i did--the table we were at didn't have a blood gutter."
14561,Susan,i thought they were gonna operate. what happened?
14242,Susan,"well, you know, technically, i don't need your permission!"
17365,Susan,"yes--to be chosen, and you have been chosen. so congratulations, and you're staying home."
14417,Susan,all i'm saying is that maybe this is a blessing in disguise.
13582,Susan,"you're a piece of work , you know that?"
13453,Susan,"no, it sounds very, very wrong."
17219,Susan,i understand.
18087,Susan,what?
15967,Susan,"attention! attention, carolyn bigsby!"
17034,Susan,"well, i don't know when he's gonna be home, but you could come back later tonight."
14009,Susan,"well, we meet on tuesdays, and it's potluck lunch. everybody has to bring something."
15073,Susan,"yeah, i can't believe i'm about to say this,but i feel sorry for him.it's like he's so fragile."
15148,Susan,a what?
14682,Susan,"well, i played in high school."
15908,Susan,"believe me, i would love to, but, um, i gotta, i gotta get dinner started for julie."
17485,Susan,"you know what, boys? not in the house. oh, my god!"
16780,Susan,"okay, i'll come there. are you still mad at me about the party?"
13443,Susan,"oh mary alice, what did you do?"
17406,Susan,what are you doing here?
13397,Susan,hey you. what're we having?
14632,Susan,where are we?
15559,Susan,"i would've never even gone there if i had thought there was a chance with us.you just closed the door so completely,i--ugh,can we just not talk about him?have some more pie.i know you like pie.i know you like me.listen--i'm not asking for us to get back together.i just want us to be friends."
17208,Susan,i know. i just--i can't stop now. i broke the seal.
18410,Susan,what do you think?
16995,Susan,"mike, how long are you gonna be? we've gotta get this food over to bree's before it gets cold."
18130,Susan,"i used to hope that one day, you would know what this feel like, and now that you do--i'm so sorry."
13918,Susan,where are you getting this?
13704,Susan,are you finished?
15284,Susan,just in passing.
14933,Susan,"of course. yeah, i see that."
13350,Susan,now? you wanna come over now? y-you have company.
16441,Susan,"oh, uh--he's just a neighbor."
18430,Susan,just a second?
13422,Susan,"i hope you don't mind, i thought i'd come by early and help you set up."
16340,Susan,"actually, no, it was gross. but you were really sweet. you just gave me a lot of kisses and said not to worry, i'd get a lot of chances to make you pancakes 'cause--"
17442,Susan,"no, you're not. you like football-- american football. specifically the colts."
15484,Susan,are you getting juice for her?
15466,Susan,he lives three houses down.
17232,Susan,"well, that's not enough. he should pay for what he did. he should go to prison."
18161,Susan,"you know, karl would never cheat, and the woman he was with-- brandi, his secretary, and he took her out for her birthday."
18221,Susan,you're gonna feel really silly when you hear what it is.
15105,Susan,right. right.
16809,Susan,do you think this is easy for me? trying to keep peace between a new husband and a teenage daughter? you're always putting me in the middle.
14765,Susan,"really? ah, i think it might be rude not to. lonnie, what's going on?"
14679,Susan,"so you and edie are, are gonna be an act."
14578,Susan,"wow. um, i find that confusing."
15440,Susan,a little?ugh--the helium hasn't even gone out of the balloons from your engagement party.
18060,Susan,who?
14107,Susan,"okay, call."
14207,Susan,the police showed me your rap sheet. you killed a man.
13711,Susan,"yeah. yeah. no, actually no, i don't know. so, by old friend, do you mean college pal, bowling buddy, saved you from drowning?"
16765,Susan,"okay, when i'm in labor and i am pushing and screaming to bring your child into the world, do you really want me to remember that you denied me syrup?"
16774,Susan,"oh, my god. bree, that is, like, the best pie you've ever made."
14034,Susan,really?
14531,Susan,you heard the girl.
18304,Susan,yeah. mike agreed to keep paying me alimony. he just sent me a text.
16309,Susan,"god, i'm so nervous."
13393,Susan,i'll be there.
15298,Susan,so?
13843,Susan,"paul, my daughter doesn't lie."
14805,Susan,of course. you're my lonnie.
16584,Susan,"because this date has special meaning for us. i sat in front of that trailer for six hours thinking you hated me, and a proposal would've brought the entire thing full circle. it would've turned a bad memory into a beautiful one."
18036,Susan,what? where the hell is it?
13736,Susan,oh fun. i'm a doggie.
17118,Susan,"not at all. in--in fact, if you wanna do a dry run for sunday brunch, i'm there for you."
13524,Susan,mrs huber.
18097,Susan,"look, i need this job. but even if i didn't, i would still like you as a person."
17212,Susan,thanks. i'm gonna try that. so you don't think i act like a lady?
16301,Susan,"uh, yeah, i, uh, have to get this sized. it's--it's a little loose."
15717,Susan,"yeah, ah."
13636,Susan,"well,time flies when you're on a stakeout in crack town."
16586,Susan,"oh, my god. i can't believe that you did this."
16786,Susan,"can you believe it? ugh! let it go. you know, mike and i decided--no party, and that's final."
16544,Susan,"come on. just for my peace of mind, i have to know he's okay."
15808,Susan,"i was gonna stay mad at you another hour, but your damn accent gets me every time."
18129,Susan,yeah.
15804,Susan,"okay, just so you know eleven is not a lot for a woman my age."
15016,Susan,"oh, well, we, we haven't even finished the high school years. i wanted to show you this one. this was from the father-daughter dance. i had to take my mother's hairstylist."
14594,Susan,"wow. i'm gonna take a cab home, okay?"
16694,Susan,carlos.how is she?
16622,Susan,"i mean, i'm sorry, but this time, gaby has just crossed the line, and i will not make myself sit through her wedding. julie thinks i'm overreacting. you don't think i'm overreacting, do you?"
17828,Susan,i thought you had a housekeeper.
15941,Susan,"okay, i know i--and don't play the parent card with me."
16143,Susan,bree? uh--hi. can you hold on a second?
13495,Susan,"i don't know. god, i hope not. i mean, they're always been wound a little tight, but i've never seen him like that. then again, who am i to judge?"
18044,Susan,"hey, katherine."
16161,Susan,excuse me?
15714,Susan,"um, you mean like outside the hospital?"
15916,Susan,i had passion with mike. and drama. lots of drama. love isn't supposed to be that hard.
14861,Susan,"no, no, no, no, no!"
16238,Susan,"i'm gonna put the phone up to jane's ear, and you can tell her whatever you need to, okay?"
15534,Susan,"$2,000?jeez! i gotta get into real estate.okay,i don't have that kind of cash."
17443,Susan,"and here are some other things you can talk about--cars, barbecue, fishing."
13607,Susan,it's hard to explain. even to myself.
15525,Susan,edie hired a-- p.i.?
14423,Susan,"oh oh oh, my, look! my kitchen! oh, it's a big fire!"
15502,Susan,like an angel.
14289,Susan,"oh, you can't be serious? morty?"
16094,Susan,mike was arrested for murder.
18101,Susan,my boots.
16132,Susan,"yeah. but somebody's gotta tell him about his new lawyer. otherwise, the guy's gonna show up,and he's gonna go, ""who the hell is he?"" ian gets that. besides, why would it be a big deal? mike and i are over."
14202,Susan,i've got to get the tape.
13690,Susan,i sure am.
16172,Susan,"well--don't--don't think that you can get out of this, you know, by just--oh, god. oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah, right--right there. oh, right there."
13532,Susan,no. thank you.
17112,Susan,"well, i drove all the way out there, and i waited for hours and then they wouldn't let me see him. uh, no. they just said that i should--i should call you. listen, i know it's a 30-day rehab. i'm not trying to break him out. i'm just trying to see him. you know what? could you just call me when you know? thank you."
14699,Susan,"no, it's okay, honey. who do you want to be with you in the family talent show?"
15205,Susan,oh.
17728,Susan,yeah! he went in there to find you.
13713,Susan,thanks.
16957,Susan,nice save. now can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong with my baby?
15549,Susan,gus? are you okay up there?
16633,Susan,"mm. lynette is right. you know, marriage is like--it's like these bonbons. you never know what you're getting until you're in the middle of it."
14880,Susan,"well, i'll say one thing for us. even with all our problems we're not acting like that."
14101,Susan,you shot yourself?
16129,Susan,cherry berry?
14606,Susan,wow.
14817,Susan,since when?
16427,Susan,"yeah. yeah, why not? sure. you know what? do you wanna run this ice cream side before it melts?"
18176,Susan,"look, travers, we're all moms here. we've all made mistakes with our kids, and what we count on is when they grow up, they'll forgive us."
13865,Susan,"oh, i'm sorry, are you okay?"
14951,Susan,"morty? morty, have you seen my mom?"
15648,Susan,you've gotta be kidding.
16688,Susan,just hurry up and get dressed. we only have forty-five minutes.
18384,Susan,"m.j., run!"
14842,Susan,"but why don't you want 'em to know about martha huber's journal? i mean, she says right in there that she was blackmailing paul's wife."
17570,Susan,you're moving again? how far are you gonna be away now? the hudson house?
17464,Susan,i am-- so sorry. miss? um-- could you just--please take good care of my friend?
18391,Susan,what are you gonna do to us?
14520,Susan,can you hang on? i got another call. hello?
15541,Susan,what did you say?
17484,Susan,ugh.
16220,Susan,it's one little date.
13662,Susan,what do you think of me?
16556,Susan,"well, maybe i am a little unprepared, but it'll be fine. i work out. i have quads of steel."
16906,Susan,lee? is something wrong?
17747,Susan,"gaby, please. most women would kill to look like you."
13450,Susan,i think we should go through with it.
14831,Susan,"oh, i think i do. you're a cold-blooded murderer."
15626,Susan,"oh, oh."
15408,Susan,"i know. i told her that.i said,""he always,always hates surprises."""
13337,Susan,how would you feel about me using your child support payments for plastic surgery?
16874,Susan,"so anyway, that's why it was so great."
14648,Susan,"yes, yes, i do."
16567,Susan,"well, i wanted to look nice for mike."
16670,Susan,"you would think that, but no. come on. this is something that we have both looked forward to for so long. don't you want it to be perfect?"
15433,Susan,"oh,karl!oh! will you--are you crazy?!"
17517,Susan,preparing them for what?
15948,Susan,and you just tell me this now?
14064,Susan,we've never answered why mary alice referred to herself as angela in that therapy session.
17057,Susan,that's a relief.
18003,Susan,but we can make brownies at home.
13791,Susan,do you mean that?
14893,Susan,"actually, i'm trying to keep a positive outlook on the whole thing. um, last night i started writing and, well, i think there's a book in there."
14481,Susan,and that was your cue to come over and flirt? you wasted your time and your doughnuts.
14839,Susan,"yes, definitely. i mean, i can understand why you wouldn't want the cops to know that you kidnapped paul. i mean, that definitely looks bad."
14267,Susan,"okay, mr. let's-just-have-fun-cause-i'm-the-charming-casual-contractor-man. you chased me, so own it, my friend!"
13923,Susan,"yeah, people fake their own abductions all the time."
13793,Susan,"lynette, it's just, this really isn't the time--"
16197,Susan,"yes, we do. you might have gotten your first diaphragm with milk money, but that doesn't give you the right to corrupt my daughter!"
13673,Susan,mrs. greenberg. do you remember those two eggs i let you borrow last christmas?
18124,Susan,"yeah, ""aw, hell."" you got a problem here, karl. your son's got some serious anger issues, and you need to figure out what's going on."
15002,Susan,i'm gonna be back in the store next week. i never got that darn horse feed.
16512,Susan,"lynette, what is wrong with you?"
15316,Susan,what do you mean?
15050,Susan,sweet.
18367,Susan,"oh, my god. i--i-i had no idea. i'm so sorry."
16779,Susan,psst! come here.
18332,Susan,"i think that bree is right--that the more tom sees you digging in your heels, the more he's gonna wanna do it."
16395,Susan,"i think if you really like this guy, you should just be honest. you should tell him that you feel a little hurt--"
17222,Susan,oh. what's going on?
16541,Susan,"oh, my god. what--where is he now?"
13957,Susan,"well, actually, i do, yeah. excuse me!"
15926,Susan,oh. did you stay here all night?
15657,Susan,"no. no, i write children's books."
17949,Susan,"i know, i know. we may have to give up a few luxuries."
15969,Susan,"let julie go and take me instead. repeat, take me. i will be a model hostage. if we have a deal, signal by sending julie to the--"
17820,Susan,"oh, please! i'm bored. mike has m.j., jackson's out of town, and you're gonna need somebody to bitch about bob to."
16000,Susan,yep! get him.
14794,Susan,please don't lie. just tell me.
15900,Susan,ian! what a surprise.
13952,Susan,you want me back?
13499,Susan,oh. goodnight.
17033,Susan,"no, he's at work."
13716,Susan,"you shelled your own crabs? okay, i don't want to butt in, but are you doing too much? because you look exhausted."
16756,Susan,"oh, yum."
13956,Susan,"and, there's nothing there."
16686,Susan,i hate to see you drive when you're this tired.
15147,Susan,"oh,uh,friday's good."
16518,Susan,"no, gaby, be reasonable."
14211,Susan,"it doesn't matter, because i will never believe anything you say ever again."
17455,Susan,"this is-- i mean, i'm just--i have been violated."
14608,Susan,what are you doing?
15125,Susan,yeah?
15557,Susan,"you're always worried about julie and me,and you beat up my new boyfriend.and now you're protecting me from edie.do you know what all that means?"
18299,Susan,"and then i realized that i would lose my alimony. so unless mike will keep paying me, i can't get married."
15741,Susan,"oh, oh, wow. oh, is this going to be awkward?"
17906,Susan,i'm in. how much are we talking?
15986,Susan,"no, ian, am i overreacting here?"
14706,Susan,"if you think edie britt cares about anybody other than herself, you are living in a fool's paradise. you don't know her the way i do, and the only reason she's interested in julie is to mess with my head."
13743,Susan,"well, you sort of interrupted our first date. but up until then, smoking hot tension. sounds pathetic, i know."
18094,Susan,because i wanted you to give me a good evaluation.
15394,Susan,it was hysterical.i thought the whole wedding day was ruined.
17784,Susan,seriously? that's terrible. is she okay?
14215,Susan,shut up.
17308,Susan,thank you. do you wanna go back in there right now and tell her?
13508,Susan,huh?
13788,Susan,"well, i wouldn't know because you never let me in. you know, there's this whole part of your life that you keep completely walled off."
15872,Susan,me? but why doesn't she leave? i-i'm the one who's been here every day for the last six months.
15266,Susan,"well,karl is a lawyer,and it could just be a prenup for another client."
16654,Susan,"oh, good! i mean, not that they said no, just--'cause i really wanted to do it."
15661,Susan,"no, no, no, no.no, turn my house around."
16581,Susan,"yes. it's also the anniversary of the day we were supposed to get engaged. a year ago tonight, you were on your way to ask me to marry you when you got hit by that stupid car."
13993,Susan,"oh, of course, take your time."
17171,Susan,"what do you have to reminisce about? he was here for a week when he was 16. what could you two have even--oh, my god, you slept together."
15108,Susan,i just know those two have something to do with that dead body.
15816,Susan,"okay, ian, you know what? this is not happening.i am just going to sleep, and you can just drive me home in the morning."
15387,Susan,"no.no,not really. um--what's the point?"
14304,Susan,"my pleasure. so i was thinking maybe you should call morty- you know, get a start working things out."
17238,Susan,quit eyeing it. i ain't sharing.
14274,Susan,okay.
17268,Susan,it's nice to meet you.
16902,Susan,uh-huh. maybe a little longer.
13547,Susan,"so paul, we noticed that you're selling the house."
14073,Susan,"oh, i can't have another baby. i mean i'm so grateful i had you, you know i don't regret a minute of that, but i found it to be completely overwhelming. sometimes i even wonder how i got through it."
13501,Susan,"don't worry, i'm not packing heat. hi."
16831,Susan,great.
15695,Susan,then i'm gonna have to find a way to force it on my finger.
17286,Susan,"bree, are you okay?"
17668,Susan,"mmm. oh, pop quiz! why did kim beale stop talking to me in eighth grade?"
17764,Susan,so bree knew?
13638,Susan,but what if i like him?
17911,Susan,"you know, if we're gonna have a get-together after the funeral, we should start thinking about food."
14077,Susan,"oh, um, so can i come over? i, i really need to talk to you about something."
14089,Susan,i don't believe this. you're leaving without even trying to talk me into having your baby? i mean how do you know i wouldn't cave. i always cave.
17810,Susan,"it was--i don't know, uh, about a month after you moved out. it was bedtime. i was trying to read to him, but he only wanted you. and he was crying so hard, and he kept asking me if you were ever coming back, and so i finally--said maybe you would. i just didn't want him to be so sad."
17483,Susan,he's only 5. i don't want him fighting.
16381,Susan,i don't think you can really thank somebody too many times for saving your life.
15863,Susan,"okay, well, i'll go, but i am not giving up on you. you know, you are going to remember the night that we danced to ""car wash,"" and not just because it was fun, but because later that night, we did some things that, trust me, are worth remembering."
15744,Susan,what an excellent question.
13321,Susan,"sure, that's fine."
18075,Susan,a regular kiss on the mouth--that lasted a little longer than i thought it would.
13882,Susan,"well, she was sort of right. after my divorce, i really leaned on her a lot."
13789,Susan,"well, every little detail is one thing. you know, weird creepy secrets, that's another."
13376,Susan,"it doesn't matter, she was his wife. he deserves to have all the facts."
17335,Susan,"okay, drop the act, ladies. i hate it, too. mike insisted that we name him after his dead grandfather."
13355,Susan,"oh. mrs. huber, how you doing?"
16821,Susan,"okay, once the light starts blinking, we've got three seconds,. so, everybody, say, ""cheese"" and hold it. one, two, three."
15101,Susan,this is the worst date i have ever been on in my life.
17241,Susan,"he got his skank pregnant, and you didn't tell me?"
15667,Susan,"oh, hi.um, we're just moving."
15123,Susan,i should switch to juice.i know the best juice place.you would love it.do you drink juice?
15970,Susan,"no, take your hands off me! carolyn, carolyn! call my cell! it's 572--"
15195,Susan,"no, there isn't time for you to deal with the red tape.my spleen is going careening into my heart.i need that operation now."
17450,Susan,nice.
14165,Susan,"oh, edie, not now. i'm kind of busy."
14396,Susan,i won't . i promise.
14412,Susan,i couldn't agree more.
15700,Susan,"look, i know it's been six months but he could still come out of it, right?i saw on the news there was this woman in peru, she woke up after ten years."
15092,Susan,"oh, a couple of weeks ago,um, i heard some noises coming from the basement,like a clanging.and i asked betty about it.she lied right to my face."
17164,Susan,"yeah, you're going to college soon, and i want him to tell you about the dangers of drugs. scare her straight, mike."
16243,Susan,it's not--
14044,Susan,yes.
15682,Susan,of course.okay.you don't even wanna know what my answer would have been?
16917,Susan,"$2,000?"
16885,Susan,"well, i don't see the problem with it--hint, hint."
16218,Susan,"wow. so zach young is loaded, huh?"
13624,Susan,"honey, i batted everything that wasn't nailed down. i'm telling you, nothing."
18340,Susan,"well, somebody did, because he sent me a text agreeing to keep paying me alimony."
17324,Susan,conner.
15858,Susan,"oh, it's coming. um, and--and this 70's cover band, well, they started to play, and--that's how we got our song."
15209,Susan,really?
18433,Susan,that's my daughter.get dressed!
18333,Susan,"oh, you guys, i'm sorry. i gotta run."
17181,Susan,imposing? who's imposing? you can stay as long as you want.
13517,Susan,hi.
13471,Susan,"hey karl, it's me. i was hoping you'll be there. um, listen, we need to talk. so, maybe when you drop julie off tomorrow, we could have a moment. it's important. give my best to-brandy. call me."
14730,Susan,"you know, edie, could you just back off? i mean the truth is we're probably never gonna find zach, anyway. it's a needle in a haystack."
14519,Susan,"i am so sorry for that last phone call. um, let's just say it was the worry talking. i just really need to talk to you, and-"
14503,Susan,"i don't know, but i'm gonna find out. wait here and lock the doors."
17751,Susan,fine. you're a pig.
17597,Susan,"so just to be clear, you're saying you don't want a relationship?"
16263,Susan,hey.
16471,Susan,"testing. one, two, three, testing."
15285,Susan,i sure did.
15706,Susan,"oh, wow.um, um, i can't accept this.this is too extravagant."
18412,Susan,new york!
17748,Susan,you are still beautiful. so you've gained a little weight. who hasn't? don't go by me. i have a weird metabolism.
15071,Susan,"well, thanks.we appreciate that."
13652,Susan,yeah.
18004,Susan,good save. let's go.
14006,Susan,thank you.
16271,Susan,yes. i accept your proposal to propose.
17602,Susan,"uh, yeah. you want to move in."
13478,Susan,while you were married to someone else!

17357,Susan,wow. i didn't know about that.
15366,Susan,ah! ooh!
16364,Susan,you've been awfully quiet since we left the market. is everything okay?
13928,Susan,"of all people, you picked that tired piece of - edie!"
15773,Susan,hmm? so what are you really doing here?
17798,Susan,what is that supposed to mean?
15134,Susan,dr. ron?what are you doing here?
16926,Susan,"okay, before we become an ugly mob, why doesn't one of us go talk to the guys?but not me. they hate me."
16341,Susan,you remember.
18085,Susan,"oh, well, that kiss was all you."
13715,Susan,"oh, here it is."
14778,Susan,"well, it's possible because i have faith in people. i mean, lonnie knows he messed up and he's sorry. he's making restitution. what, you don't believe people deserve second chances?"
17818,Susan,you're no better than i am.
14748,Susan,"because, i have a lot of things to say so you can just listen. i'll buy you some food. when was the last time you ate?"
15596,Susan,"bree, i'm worried about you.do--do you think that you should see someone?"
14086,Susan,"oh god, you're not taking this well. oh i was afraid of this."
14916,Susan,"well, i'm gonna take a shower."
17361,Susan,"hey, got any plans tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.? 'cause now you do. bree needs about two truckloads of flowers picked up from--what?"
17930,Susan,"as long as you're here, i think there's a loose shingle on my roof. do you think maybe you could fix it for me?"
14475,Susan,i need you to check into someone else's background.there is this plumber i know.
16570,Susan,"okay, i know it's dark, but i can see you."
17625,Susan,good. so who the hell are you?
13620,Susan,okay.great. fine.thank you.
17962,Susan,pearls or towel--you decide.
13794,Susan,"lynette! you know, when are you coming back? lynette! lynette!"
15382,Susan,"if you don't wanna be my boyfriend,fine.don't beat up the only guy who wants to volunteer for the job."
17656,Susan,i sort of guessed that when you painted my house.
14047,Susan,"no, of course he didn't. so, what happened exactly?"
17001,Susan,ice cream. sorry.
15201,Susan,the surgeon is slicing me open a week from tomorrow.what other choice do i have?
17440,Susan,"well, i do. we need a shirt that says, ""i'm a responsible citizen,"" not ""my favorite clothing store also sells bongs."""
15189,Susan,edie!
17963,Susan,i have been naked on this street. it would be nice to take the heat off that story.
17002,Susan,wow. you never ask for my help. must be something easy.
15922,Susan,"nothing. i just had a few drinks with my girlfriends, and thank god, because it gave me the courage to come over here and tell you really in my heart."
13696,Susan,i just have a feeling.
14082,Susan,don't even think about it.
17366,Susan,"but it's a huge honor. yes, we've established that. it's huge. it's an honor. we get it."
17242,Susan,"okay, i get it."
14438,Susan,"she did, huh?"
15903,Susan,"uh, edie? oh, she's just a neighbor. she visits mike after her hepatitis c treatments."
16229,Susan,"so, erika, you were fighting with that guy when i came in. have you had a lot of those organ donor people around today?"
15241,Susan,"don't worry,honey.this time,it is strictly a business arrangement."
15729,Susan,"well, ah, i'm not sure that i've ever seen this shade of green before."
14453,Susan,give me the bad news first.
13370,Susan,"alright ladies, lift 'em up. to mary alice, good friend and neighbor. wherever you are, we hope you've found peace."
15006,Susan,"i know this sounds awful, but i'm kind of glad the guy's dead."
15185,Susan,bree?we have a question for you.
15357,Susan,yeah.
16250,Susan,sold.
17689,Susan,"you know, when your 24-year-old daughter calls you and tells you she's bringing home a boy from college, you sort of expect it to be, well, a boy."
14535,Susan,"uh, no, he's on a big plumbing job. what's up?"
16026,Susan,"um, yeah, that sounds great. you pick."
18141,Susan,"so is it just you, or do you have a family?"
17405,Susan,i'm sorry. i can't give that to you.
15325,Susan,that's not helpful.
13581,Susan,"again, i don't know what you're talking about. but- yeah, i did."
15390,Susan,omelettes. you want me to make you one?
13313,Susan,"yeah, sometimes people pretend to be one way on the outside and they're totally different on the inside."
16574,Susan,"what? ugh, damn it! stupid mossy trees!"
17356,Susan,"i'm sorry. i--i just want our kid to have a great name. i don't think ""maynard"" is great."
16247,Susan,"no, it'll be fine. ian wants me there."
15180,Susan,"i mean, why not?'cause all my life,i have jumped through hoops to keep men from leaving.but i'm not doing it anymore.so tough luck, pally.you just missed out on a good thing."
15511,Susan,"edie, why are you torturing that girl?"
14305,Susan,"oh oh oh. you don't have to gasp, my mother exaggerates."
14114,Susan,i don't hate zach. i just think he's sort of crazy.
15459,Susan,"okay,you can share my popcorn."
18329,Susan,"yeah, but, no, this doesn't make any sense because mike knew that it wasn't for real."
17713,Susan,right! right. you mind easing away so i can dance with my daughter?
14998,Susan,"do you want to tell her, or should i? i'm your husband's guardian angel."
15297,Susan,"okay,that part sounds better when you don't read it out loud.and what are you doing reading it anyway?"
15415,Susan,oh! get out! get--
15278,Susan,"no,of course not.well,okay,this is good because--you know,if this experience helped you to realize your true feelings,then,uh--then we did something good here."
15035,Susan,did addison talk to you about me?
17302,Susan,ah. ah.
14823,Susan,"i was just wondering if, if there's a ball park of how long i will have to wait. a week, a month, after lunch?"
14015,Susan,what are you thinking?
16455,Susan,themes?
18187,Susan,we need to be annoying and persistent. we're good at that.
17304,Susan,"i'm not in labor, okay?"
15319,Susan,i think i have to break up with dr. ron.
13852,Susan,you are just the sweetest guy.
15353,Susan,i am aware of that.
16631,Susan,"i think so, too. but, you know, then i remember, that's what i thought about me and karl."
14091,Susan,"oh, okay. thanks."
15141,Susan,really?you were up all night?
13348,Susan,the clog's in the pipe.
13720,Susan,i beg your pardon?
13387,Susan,"no, it's fine, i get it."
14876,Susan,"thanks. that's great. 'cause if you decided to hang on to my joni mitchell cds i'd have to come after you with a club. you're right, it's not funny. actually, i did want to see if you were aware that you gave me back the valentine's day card that i made you."
18140,Susan,"oh, yeah. i saw the moving van. welcome."
13529,Susan,i'm fine.
14776,Susan,"i know. i know. it's just, lonnie's family. you know he's always been there for me. he paid my rent when i was waiting for my first royalty check. he called me everyday when karl left. i mean, i just owe him so much."
16839,Susan,"bree, just get me the number."
14330,Susan,"morty, i'd like to have a relationship again. and at my age, with a kid, if she moves in to my house, even for a couple of years, i'm doomed."
16439,Susan,"well, are you free for dinner tomorrow?"
15221,Susan,cancer?
15642,Susan,he was just here. i think you should call him.
17148,Susan,"katherine, dylan, hi. what's up?"
16666,Susan,"fine, we'll skip the chocolate. how out a champagne fountain? oh, i know! maybe we can make the champagne flow through the ice sculpture."
17541,Susan,spider. big one. gotta go!
17217,Susan,excuse me. i have to put something in a box and stick it in the closet.
14040,Susan,i have a little confession to make.
17459,Susan,"yeah, you'll drop by later--with potato skins on your breath, you miserable two-timer!"
17151,Susan,"oh, of course you do. that's right! this is my cousin timmy. he stayed with us that summer that he went to band camp."
16413,Susan,"yeah, it's just, um--you know, ian and i had a had a little--thing."
16204,Susan,"honey, i was over at edie's today and i walked in the door and--"
14013,Susan,i don't think so.
13661,Susan,that's a guy not a band.
13663,Susan,"i'm sorry, could you repeat that?"
15265,Susan,"i think i know that ring.that's his grandmother's ring.it's a family heirloom.and,you know,he might just be having it cleaned or something."
13552,Susan,i think i'm being blackmailed.
13866,Susan,"julie, what else can i do? he can't stay here!"
13826,Susan,"oh no, isn't helen rowland going last?"
17743,Susan,so--i know her?
18325,Susan,so they're sending you back? when?
15169,Susan,"well, you know,you're gonna be--hacking into me,and i just wanted to make sure that you feel ready."
16453,Susan,you know what i would have said. it doesn't matter now.
14879,Susan,"look, are you sure this is what you want to do? i mean, i understand that you don't want our relationship to continue, you have made that clear. but i sort of thought down the long corridors of time, maybe you and i could be friends, and if you keep acting like this--"
17420,Susan,"and we killed them, mike!"
13416,Susan,"i don't know, i was gonna take her out at the knees, but it all happened so fast."
16950,Susan,"okay, fine. you're still angry, but i'm gonna make it up to you. when they come after that tree house, they're going to have one susan mayer chained to it."
16616,Susan,i don't want to be paid. i want my wedding back.
15758,Susan,the police? what did they find?
18105,Susan,i am an art teacher.
14152,Susan,"oh, you might as well just stay under there and never come up for air because when you do, i'm gonna choke the living daylights out of you."
13674,Susan,i need those back.
14772,Susan,"you know what? this is one of those times when you find out who your real friends are, so yeah."
16609,Susan,you stole my florist?
15431,Susan,why?
15543,Susan,hey there.you look thirsty.
17456,Susan,don't touch me! or my ears! my ears are dead to you.
13519,Susan,i hope it's not important.
18242,Susan,what was that about?
15042,Susan,"oh, carol, you don't have to clean that up. they have clerks for that."
16872,Susan,if we are lucky
15790,Susan,your heart is beating even faster than mine.
14948,Susan,"well, you've been married four times. i think you got it down."
18274,Susan,"actually, i did think of one way you could repay me."
14732,Susan,okay.
15608,Susan,"oh, good, then you'll be prime meat picking when you go to jail!"
15579,Susan,what? you just confessed.
14381,Susan,i am so sorry. how did i forget you?
17781,Susan,i'm sure you will.
17122,Susan,"i don't know, but i've had a taste of ironed pillowcases, and i am not going back."
13906,Susan,"karl, do you want to join us?"
18347,Susan,"ooh. hey. um, can i talk to you a sec?"
18428,Susan,what the hell was that?
15627,Susan,"oh, help!can anybody hear me? julie?i, i need you to try to unlock the door. oh, what am i saying?okay , i need you to unbuckle yourself and try to find a neighbor."
15537,Susan,what if i can't?
15716,Susan,"sorry.ah, well, that sounds, ah, just, ah, that sounds great."
16912,Susan,don't. we'll just keep looking. i have a feeling we're gonna find that cute little guy.
18188,Susan,"i'm in the classroom all day, and i have meetings after."
15996,Susan,mike--you're out of the hospital.
16963,Susan,"yeah. but apparently, his dad can rise from the dead. so let's hope the baby gets that gene."
15755,Susan,"well, i was at my friend bree's engagement party the other night. you know when you came in and you did that whole 'orson killed his wife' thing. i was just wondering if you could elaborate."
18020,Susan,"hey, guys. what are we talking about?"
18251,Susan,um--how about dinner tomorrow night?
18057,Susan,"well, i wanted to do something more free. it's an imagination-building exercise."
16840,Susan,i'm so excited. pregnant gals sharing a doctor!
13379,Susan,shut up.
17869,Susan,"please, help! please! i'm getting a really unpleasant picture of what you're like in the ol' sackarooni."
13771,Susan,here you go. have a nice weekend.
14050,Susan,sure.
18104,Susan,"wow, and i was worried that we'd be out of each other's lives forever. mm, lucky, lucky."
15372,Susan,okay.
18159,Susan,really?
16109,Susan,hi! i'm sorry i'm late. where are your folks?
17103,Susan,i'm just trying to comfort her.
14640,Susan,"yes, hi. i was just wondering, are you having some remodeling done on your house or something?"
14469,Susan,right. i appreciate you talking to me.
16693,Susan,you clean up pretty good yourself.
17546,Susan,damn it.
13472,Susan,"i'm coming! karl, what are you doing here? i asked you to come tomorrow."
16235,Susan,hi.
18390,Susan,now keep the volume really high. you don't wanna hear all the boring grown-up talk.
15351,Susan,"okay,will you shut up?it's not funny. i was drugged."
14312,Susan,"mom, can we talk about this later?"
16068,Susan,"will they be expecting stomach cramps, acid reflux, night sweats?"
16362,Susan,that was the first night that we spent together.
17916,Susan,"great. yeah, i haven't worn these jeans in a while, and i found 20 bucks in the pocket. don't you just love when that happens? also, karl left me for his secretary, so i need you to change these locks."
14983,Susan,oh! i'm your daughter!
17348,Susan,"oh, honey. can you get all my toiletries out of the bathroom?"
16491,Susan,"yeah, and i'm about to do this on purpose, too."
17441,Susan,"absolutely. put this on. now--let's talk about acceptable topics of conversation. you like sports, right?"
14224,Susan,i don't suppose you have any idea where i found it?
14539,Susan,why?
17932,Susan,you can't retire. i break too many things.
13488,Susan,pretty much.
17725,Susan,jackson. jackson.
15245,Susan,i don't know--exactly.
16179,Susan,what?
13836,Susan,"god, you are so weak!"
16318,Susan,"oh, not that chair. that's the wobbler. i'm saving up for a new set. here, sit here."
13598,Susan,bye.
15492,Susan,"ugh! ooh,out! get out!"
14373,Susan,"let's go back inside?! lamont, give it up, you're not getting any!"
13628,Susan,"yes,and the flirting made me think that he was kind and trustworthy and honest and hygienic. that's how it is with me. a guy just smiles at me three times and i'm picking out wedding china. i'm a mess."
17970,Susan,well--at least you won't feel bad if you ever lose them.
17113,Susan,don't talk. i'm smelling. what is that?
14564,Susan,why?
13693,Susan,"okay, gimme a break here. i'm just grasping at straws."
17097,Susan,"no. there's no tomorrow. it's now. you will quit this now. you will go to rehab, or so help me, i will leave you. i will take this baby, and i will leave you."
17771,Susan,"hello? it's me. i just wanted to tell you--i've been thinking about it, and, um, i'm okay with you dating mike."
15501,Susan,she's sleeping.
16604,Susan,"okay, if you think for one second--"
14593,Susan,i see.
14185,Susan,"paul. you know, he said it was an accident,but i'm telling you, i think that's why mary alice was being blackmailed."
16431,Susan,because we had just had a fight--about you.
15439,Susan,"oh,no!you don't mean that."
15385,Susan,i can't tell you.
16415,Susan,don't panic.
13805,Susan,"julie, you'll never guess who you got a letter from. zach. isn't that weird, him writing you?"
14918,Susan,"karl, last night was two old friends helping each other through a rough patch. that's it."
14284,Susan,what's wrong?
18313,Susan,after the crash--
16351,Susan,"well, the difference is huge. i mean, one way you're trusting me, and--and the other way, you're trying to make it official."
16519,Susan,"oh, come on!"
17729,Susan,i didn't see him.
14407,Susan,that's it? that's the explanation?
17716,Susan,"lloyd, i'm sorry. i can't help i i don't want my daughter to be someone's fourth wife."
14721,Susan,"mike, wait!"
14521,Susan,"oh, my god. where have you been?"
13907,Susan,"oh, well--"" ""i am the best, aren't i."
15398,Susan,okay--
15029,Susan,"okay, i didn't exactly love what i found out about you today, but the goal was to learn, not to judge."
16730,Susan,"no,you said you did."
16749,Susan,i know. she was like a sister to you.
14292,Susan,i said i was sorry.
15000,Susan,"well, i'm gonna get out of here. mr. prudy, i want you to hurry up and get back on your feet."
16922,Susan,"mike, wait. we should talk about this."
16923,Susan,"yeah, i've seen a lot of cable, so i get it."
13800,Susan,i think it's just that we think that it's easier to keep it all in.
17980,Susan,congratulations on getting me out of your office.
14959,Susan,"well, i am screwed up, but it wasn't your fault. entirely."
14796,Susan,"no, i can't."
15765,Susan,"bree, we are just doing this because we love you. but, if you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt--"
14454,Susan,oh my god! oh my god!
16011,Susan,"no, i'm not!"
13862,Susan,oh my god!
15923,Susan,"but first, i think i should use the powder room."
14053,Susan,what?
15251,Susan,mostly.
17770,Susan,what am i supposed to do?
16436,Susan,i just guess i'm in a rush.
14522,Susan,"well, i'm really sorry for that last message. i was just, uh--"
16695,Susan,i can't believe this is happening.it's like mary alice all over again.
16588,Susan,will you marry me?
16630,Susan,i'm so glad we're doing this. i hate it when we fight.
17231,Susan,"how can you do that? he put you in a coma. i sat there day after day, wondering if you were gonna live. as far as i'm concerned, orson can go to hell."
13798,Susan,"no, it's not! so you got addicted to your kids' add medication. it happens."
18296,Susan,"oh, shoot. well, can you tell him to call me as soon as he gets back?"
14171,Susan,"i don't know. five minutes, give or take three hours."
17119,Susan,"oh, none taken."
17703,Susan,"uh-huh, she's a grown woman with stars in her eyes who's in love with a 3-times loser."
17789,Susan,the whole thing's like a miracle.
17257,Susan,did you have to tell karl about rehab?
16704,Susan,"i wish edie were here.without her,there's no one to give us the dish."
18119,Susan,"this is nothing, mr. hobson. we were just having a difference of opinion."
13452,Susan,lynette?
14189,Susan,"oh, my god, yes. we should do that."
14704,Susan,"oh, don't even joke like that."
17430,Susan,"mike! uh, what's going on?"
14456,Susan,what?
17398,Susan,i think i'll have it done right now.
15673,Susan,"oh, my god.what? stop! that's enough. enough, enough. back up.and that ring-- that was for me, right?"
16602,Susan,you're getting married on my wedding day?
18179,Susan,"oh, i think my leg's asleep."
13448,Susan,yeah.
15451,Susan,"no,his feelings.he's the one with the feelings,not me."
13399,Susan,edie.
14498,Susan,"well, that's before i found mrs. huber's journal in his truck."
16559,Susan,"i mean, the doctor said that mike might never come out of the coma. and then when he did, he didn't even remember me."
16487,Susan,"yes, and do you know who i blame? i blame karl and mike. why isn't anybody mad at them? i mean, let's face it. the men-- they get away with murder. they're scum!"
14109,Susan,"don't be silly. why would i do that? no, i've just been really busy grocery shopping."
15803,Susan,"because it was really eleven, and i knocked off two, and you're still judging me."
14688,Susan,thank you so much for changing your mind about helping me. i really appreciate it.
17632,Susan,"well, i was starting to change my mind, and then i show up and find 5 feet of lip gloss in the shower. i brought hot wings. you're not getting any."
16411,Susan,good. i should go.
13939,Susan,"yeah, that part when you slept with your secretary was really exciting."
14208,Susan,"no, of course i don't believe that, but i also didn't believe that karl was going to cheat on me, and i didn't believe that mary alice was gonna kill herself. i mean, let's face it, mike -- blind faith is not my friend."
16463,Susan,no! he--he pounced.
14300,Susan,"wow, i'm just dragging today, shall we put on another pot of coffee?"
14741,Susan,"so then i just threw my ice cream at him and ran. well, somebody say something."
18354,Susan,"yeah, well, i don't know if that's gonna happen."
14464,Susan,"and bob , i can't even begin to tell you how much that means to me. so, i'm going to walk up to that house, and you're going to let me. and you know why? because behind that badge and that big, you could crush me like a fly, chest, there's a heart. a heart that believes in love."
17410,Susan,"you, come with me. why would you humiliate me in front of my friends? are you a lunatic?"
15613,Susan,"oh, ah."
14737,Susan,"whoa. no, no no. no, no no, oh. don't, don't, don't. don't, don't, zach, don't run away. wait! come on, just, would you just get back here? come on really, just, let's just talk."
15625,Susan,"ahh.okay, break times over."
15811,Susan,"i mean, the last time you did this, it turned into a lifetime commitment, and i'm just, i'm not ready for that."
15486,Susan,she doesn't know?
14900,Susan,what was it?
15420,Susan,"okay,now remember,i'm broke."
18051,Susan,"yep. i'm complicated like that. aren't you glad you divorced me? if you two want a painting so bad, paint your own."
13649,Susan,"oh,yeah, sure, go ahead. do what you've got to do."
14922,Susan,"i'm sorry, what?"
16947,Susan,katherine.
13362,Susan,anybody home? i need to borrow sugar?
15199,Susan,what?
16106,Susan,"well, i am certainly not playing with a woman that is willing to let mike take the fall for her psycho husband."
14065,Susan,ooh. valentine's day card. it's pretty.
17191,Susan,"it wasn't a claim. he was sitting right here without a stitch of clothing on, and i couldn't have cake."
15424,Susan,where'd you find that?
16639,Susan,together!
18031,Susan,"yeah. it was a little beach we went to for our honeymoon. uh, i mean, you know how much mike loves the ocean."
17719,Susan,what is this about you never getting married?
17278,Susan,sorry.
17070,Susan,"yeah, i can see that. hi. i'm his neighbor. cute shoes. why the hell would you give mike drugs?"
15780,Susan,"yep, scenery's great.so, um, maybe i should unpack.where should i do that?"
16454,Susan,"maggie, these cakes are fantastic."
14620,Susan,what? how could you not tell me that? we share everything. that's what we're known for. that's our thing.
17526,Susan,look what he did with my hair. i kind of like the bangs.
16203,Susan,"yeah, um--about that--god, i wish there was a pill you could take to protect your heart."
16914,Susan,what?
16915,Susan,how's bob's suit?
16186,Susan,"ok, you search the closet. i'm gonna look under the bed."
16125,Susan,"well, mine haven't, and i know something that bree probably doesn't. when orson was seventeen, he spent time in a mental institution."
13899,Susan,"yeah, we're going to a restaurant downtown. a guy who plays piano and an open mike. julie got a bunch of her girlfriends together, so we're just going to make a night of it."
14562,Susan,"oh, my god. so when can we see bree?"
15581,Susan,bree-- are you okay?
17923,Susan,just leave!
18192,Susan,"i was cooking, all right?"
16064,Susan,"and they know about me as in ""mum, dad, bloody good news. i've got myself a smashing new girlfriend."""
16070,Susan,"okay, i'll give it a shot."
17319,Susan,i am not naming my son after a quarterback.
13505,Susan,"bree, what does it say on the rest of the tape?"
14570,Susan,what? what is it?
13839,Susan,"well, yes, they were writing to each other."
16548,Susan,that's why i have to go. i have to make amends and heal his broken heart.
16969,Susan,"well, he's your father. i should know him, and besides, that genetic counselor said we should gather data about your family's history. maybe you dad knows something you don't. i mean, i should meet him for the sake of our baby."
16409,Susan,this is from me and ian.
15193,Susan,"hi. i need an operation on my spleen,and i just found out i don't have medical insurance.is there anyone i can sue?"
15826,Susan,cigarettes?
14329,Susan,because she wants to move in with me.
15931,Susan,susan.
18030,Susan,i painted it. it was a gift for him.
15588,Susan,oh.
17497,Susan,"gaby, juanita's fat for your age."
18345,Susan,"yes, sure. why not?"
15702,Susan,don't say it.you just keep doing your job and i'll keep doing mine.oops.
15177,Susan,jim--
17571,Susan,"yeah. it's great. uh, we'll be like--one big, happy, divorced family."
16024,Susan,"oh, no, i'm your boss' girlfriend. surely he mentioned me."
15280,Susan,thanks.i owe you one.
16628,Susan,thank you. i was just bringing you this.
16813,Susan,"no, no, we can salvage this. just work with me."
18025,Susan,hey.
15367,Susan,oh!
14940,Susan,"i'm here. hi, morty, reverend hopkins. i'm sorry i'm late to your rehearsal."
14543,Susan,"listen, i know you're upset, but is this really what you think your mother would want you doing?"
17674,Susan,jackson?
13528,Susan,i don't know that people really say that anymore.
17343,Susan,"oh. uh--okay. i'm just gonna level with you. my husband picked the name, and i think it's horrible, and i know over time, he's gonna agree."
16668,Susan,"well, the doves are not going to release themselves."
16920,Susan,there must be some way i can apologize to them.
14767,Susan,you had to move money? what does that mean?
13602,Susan,"oh,really? that's great."
16120,Susan,you would really get him the best lawyer in town?
14179,Susan,"maybe fifteen years ago. not anymore. now we're just lonely and desperate, and they know it, and they just sit there, ready to pounce, waiting for us to take any crumb they're willing to throw our way. i don't want crumbs. i want mike."
17563,Susan,"i'm sorry. m.j. was excited about the bike, so jackson took off the training wheels and taught him. he didn't know."
15001,Susan,i'm not giving up.
18320,Susan,i'm sorry. we'll go fishing another time.
15474,Susan,karl. what's going on?
14495,Susan,i wasn't talking about dinner.
13435,Susan,"oh no, it's okay."
15891,Susan,"oh, but you--i was just trying to help him remember.tell her, mike.we were-- we were making progress."
15618,Susan,hi.
13784,Susan,mike--
17060,Susan,i got you the fondue set.
16490,Susan,"hey, uh, i waited for that spot while the guy made three phone calls and flossed his teeth. you can't just steal it."
14426,Susan,window.
13442,Susan,i keep hoping he'll ask me out.
17008,Susan,really?
14703,Susan,"well, it is a family recital, and edie is not family."
15485,Susan,you ripped the woman's heart out.why would she want juice from you?
13792,Susan,"well, i hope that, your, you know, little secret keeps you warm at night because you're throwing something really great away to protect it!"
13608,Susan,oh wow.
15342,Susan,"okay, yes,i did remarry my ex,but it was only because he has great health insurance.did miss blabbermouth tell you that, too?"
15411,Susan,"uh,just talking."
14759,Susan,lonnie. what are you doing here?
14176,Susan,okay. all right. give me a minute. i'll go change my clothes.
14484,Susan,"um, i say, oh! hold that thought. edie, edie stop! stop! hang on."
14467,Susan,"and despite the evidence, despite all that's been laid out in front of me, i can't help feeling that there's more to the story. does that sound stupid?"
15239,Susan,"11:30, wednesday morning. right?"
13962,Susan,how creepy is mrs. huber's sister!
13473,Susan,tomorrow! i'm in a towel!
16988,Susan,"if you can't feel the tiniest bit of remorse over taking a human life--no, i don't think you do."
17000,Susan,"gee, i don't think i've ever heard such strong opinions on the subject. i mean, not that it's something i talk about a lot--or ever."
17403,Susan,"okay, new rule. from now on, sex only happens in the bedroom, door closed, between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 p.m."
15712,Susan,the coffee machines was broken so i got us a couple of smoothies.they had strawberry and strawberry.
16983,Susan,"you killed a crooked cop who was coming after you. that's self-defense, and even so, you regret it, right?"
16854,Susan,"no, no! wait, wait, wait. gaby, you know how it works. okay, first, i have to go over all the signals. okay, so, um, this is movie, um, tv--"
13745,Susan,thanks.
16489,Susan,"excuse me! uh, hey! excuse me. that's my space!"
14474,Susan,"um, um-she, she-i uh."
16429,Susan,"he wants to thank you for saving us, and he wants to show that he's not jealous of you. how's that for irony?"
18396,Susan,what are you gonna do to us? why did you bring us here?
17076,Susan,"what was i supposed to do, mike? leave 'em in your truck? i'm not gonna sit back and watch you spin out of control."
16045,Susan,why do you have to be this way?
16100,Susan,"but mike is in jail, and you said yourself you thought orson did it."
17876,Susan,todd shaffer. i was 14.
15602,Susan,what?
16155,Susan,i didn't know they were gonna come tonight.
15407,Susan,she's planned this whole secret wedding.it's a surprise.
15617,Susan,that's not true.
17866,Susan,gladly.
15183,Susan,wow.i wouldn't want you to hate yourself.
16202,Susan,"okay, that's the other thing. that cannot happen anymore. you and i have always had an amazing relationship. let's not mess it up now."
17646,Susan,yeah. i gotta have one more. ah! thank you for doing this.
13382,Susan,the measuring cup?
14078,Susan,"it's kind of important, um, yeah i guess it can wait. so i'll see you at seven?"
17264,Susan,"oh, really? you guys live one day at a time? is your first thought when she's late that maybe she's out using again or maybe she's dead? it just seems like everything is so fragile right now, which is not the way you want it to be when you're about to have a baby."
14908,Susan,you probably don't know that your father and edie broke up last night.
18018,Susan,what?
16897,Susan,do you like wine?
13751,Susan,you're a mess.
13588,Susan,"dinner time. here kitty, kitty, kitty!"
17736,Susan,"oh, i shouldn't. they're yours."
15300,Susan,"well,that's a big word.we just started dating,and we have a connection,and i'm gonna follow it through and see where it goes."
14110,Susan,"uh, dinner, tonight?"
15399,Susan,"wait a second,we're--we're not flirting."
17562,Susan,"hey, doc. uh, don't you hand out lollipops to brave little boys?"
17829,Susan,"i just--jackson called earlier, and, um--you know, he went to riverton to visit his old art professor, and she offered him a job."
16313,Susan,"it's so great to finally meet both of you. oh, this is for you."
15095,Susan,how old do you think i am?
13587,Susan,mr whiskars.
17067,Susan,"i'm sorry, so--orson already knows about mike?"
18058,Susan,"jessie, you said that i could plan the lesson today, and i think this is valuable. i'm just trying to be creative."
14684,Susan,hmm.
18308,Susan,sweet! let's get to the car wash on our way to the courthouse.
15234,Susan,karl--
14342,Susan,mom. mom.
18037,Susan,it is possible.
13457,Susan,"you can afford a cabin, but you can't scrape up child support?"
15960,Susan,what?
17306,Susan,"i'm sorry. i panicked. your mother just invited herself to stay with us for three weeks, and you said nothing. i had to come up with a plan."
16127,Susan,"no, but it's a piece of the puzzle. i mean, he did have an affair with her. and when you combine that with the fact that his first wife went missing--"
13331,Susan,"julie, i like mr. delfino, i do. it's just, i don't know if i'm ready to start dating yet."
15536,Susan,yes!
18184,Susan,"okay. i want to do edie justice, and for that to happen, i need four words, okay?"
14947,Susan,"mom, i need answers."
17885,Susan,"it's not a compliment, you tramp! okay, i am not gonna take relationship tips from a woman who has hooked up with--what is it? over a thousand men?"
16124,Susan,yesterday.
16004,Susan,"big picture, karl. his hand up our daughter's shirt."
17506,Susan,"okay, first off, it wasn't as bad as it looked."
14934,Susan,"oh, uh. so what have you been doing lately?"
18181,Susan,like what?
13828,Susan,"i'm sorry, it wasn't my decision."
16870,Susan,"yeah! i-i wanted to scream. you know, are you nuts? do you just wanna jinx it?"
16326,Susan,"oh, my god! i'm so sorry! are you all right?"
16714,Susan,"listen,um.maybe this isn't-"
14627,Susan,"um, actually, i think what we're known for is sharing clothes. yeah. i think that's our thing."
13822,Susan,because he has money. a lot of it.
17006,Susan,"oh, sure. i'll--i'll bring up a tray."
14744,Susan,but-
15462,Susan,"orson,i'm flattered.uh,really.you--you don't wanna date me.i-i mean,my love life is just so complicated right now.well-- no,i won't bore you with the details."
17614,Susan,"jackson, what we have here has been working pretty well."
17236,Susan,"no, i'm not finished with it. it's a lamaze class. i guarantee you i will not be the only woman in there holding a chimichanga. wow, it's all couples. i wish mike didn't have that rehab thing tonight."
17877,Susan,he dumped me during math class.
17253,Susan,"hey, guys. mike, you remember karl? and this is karl's wife marisa."
14777,Susan,"okay, who in this room has not committed a felony, raise your hand. ah, ah, ah. not so fast."
17009,Susan,"oh, thank god! you have no idea where my mind went."
14618,Susan,"what do you mean, you know?"
17702,Susan,that has got to stop. i'm gonna do something.
17766,Susan,you knew about katherine and mike?
17495,Susan,hear what?
14827,Susan,why--are you doing here?
16608,Susan,francois!
16825,Susan,sure is. can you come?
17783,Susan,what did happen?
17642,Susan,ugh!
16486,Susan,and support you means--acting like we're in junior high?
13633,Susan,"then you're going to have to get zach to tell you something, so we have more to go on."
16837,Susan,"oh, i can talk him into it. what's his name?"
15715,Susan,a date?ahhhh.
13964,Susan,"hello, anybody home?"
13753,Susan,what time do you want me to be ready?
17513,Susan,"like, i have this rule--no toy guns. except everything that m.j. picks up--whether it's a hairbrush, a hanger, everything--he pretends it's a gun."
18363,Susan,"okay. bye, mike. have a nice wedding."
13590,Susan,noway.
16477,Susan,who is it this time?
17639,Susan,may i ask who's calling?
13538,Susan,"no, like i told you before, we're just friends."
14458,Susan,i don't believe it.
15116,Susan,"oh,no,i can't do that."
18403,Susan,what if your daughter could see you now? is this how you'd want her to see you? as a monster who could murder an innocent child?
15881,Susan,punch it!
15901,Susan,"uh, a little. i-- just, the last time we saw each other, it was so awkward and complicated."
15992,Susan,you keep your nephew away from my daughter or else.
17705,Susan,aren't i?
16944,Susan,why don't you get-- tree house plugs?
14567,Susan,"yeah. he's determined to see that kid behind bars. so tomorrow at school, i want you to let everybody know that we got this new, expensive security system."
15067,Susan,"well, it's your word against his."
13702,Susan,hmm. how about midnight?
17841,Susan,"bob! um--uh, what are you doing here?"
17808,Susan,"sweetie, if you're worried that i don't like your daddy spending time with katherine, don't be. i think it's great."
18377,Susan,"aren't you hungry, though? maybe there's a restaurant up ahead."
16648,Susan,you do?
13322,Susan,"yeah. i'm just so angry. if mary alice was having problems, she should have come to us; she should have let us help her."
16596,Susan,we got engaged last night. we're getting married!
17386,Susan,"i knew wayne was the reason she moved away, and the second she moved back, he started stalking her again."
17108,Susan,"how do you say no to someone in need? that wasn't rhetorical. seriously, you got anything?"
14239,Susan,"so, can i?"
14151,Susan,"oh, julie, zach, this is ridiculous. you can't hold your breath forever."
13767,Susan,"maybe i am being silly, but going to a hotel with a man is a big deal to me. what if mike is hiding something?"
16481,Susan,they bet me in a game of poker. they made decisions about my life over a hand of five-card stud. wrong does not even begin to cover it.
17957,Susan,what? mike bought those? he bought her pearls?
16847,Susan,why not?
15936,Susan,what is this?
13670,Susan,"so, how'd you get the fat lip?"
16135,Susan,"um, yeah, about that--it's ian. he's not crazy about me spending time with my ex."
17509,Susan,this conversation is over. tell bob and lee that i'll pay for the dent in their lawn. you did not!
15796,Susan,"oh, ian. it's okay. some people have a lot of lovers, and some just a few. it doesn't matter."
13744,Susan,any particular reason?
14834,Susan,"uh, he's, follow me."
16910,Susan,"nothing, huh?"
15375,Susan,okay.
18049,Susan,"well, now i'm ungiving it. try to keep up."
17183,Susan,it would?
14444,Susan,"oh god, really?"
14161,Susan,"well, i also loved junk food, and i gave that up, and i survived."
14421,Susan,"oh my god! oh my god, that's my house!"
17617,Susan,"no, it wouldn't."
18126,Susan,karl--
17947,Susan,"yeah. that's quite a tad. but we're starting in the middle of the year, so we'd only pay half, right?"
13669,Susan,"oh, which ones?"
15943,Susan,"nope, we're fine. besides, i can't leave until julie gets back with my toothpaste."
15597,Susan,"okay, well, then why don't you stop and go to bed?"
13642,Susan,"well,if you'd only lied to me about it once, it wouldn't be."
17216,Susan,it's not your favorite?
17303,Susan,a few weeks apart. wanna go to the movies?
16285,Susan,"the place came out great, huh?"
15242,Susan,"so we shouldn't expect a wedding gift,huh?"
18120,Susan,"shut up, karl."
15692,Susan,"oh, shut up."
16615,Susan,gaby--
17352,Susan,is that what it said?
18371,Susan,okay.
17091,Susan,yeah.
18358,Susan,wow. you're getting married this weekend?
16435,Susan,"no. no, i'm gonna go with the crab cakes and the little quesadillas. well, all we need is a wedding cake, and we're done."
17895,Susan,"aw, come on, edie. i said i was sorry."
17633,Susan,"sorry, bad time. i have the mailman upstairs in my tub."
15264,Susan,a ring!what did it look like?
16237,Susan,you've done everything you could. she knows that you love her.
17649,Susan,"yes. we're starting completely over, so this time, we're gonna do things right."
16086,Susan,i want to.
14898,Susan,"oh no, no wait, no wait, no wait. four glasses is my limit."
17400,Susan,yeah. he--he's hard to keep track of.
17099,Susan,"uh, she went to the hospital with carlos. he was pretty banged up, but they say he's gonna be okay."
17530,Susan,"you're gonna be in magazines, too?"
18373,Susan,that sucks. how could they cancel your flight?
13377,Susan,"no, this was serious, i know it was. we gotta find out what was going on."
15321,Susan,"lynette,he is everything i could possibly want in a boyfriend,and i just don't know if i feel that--spark."
14259,Susan,you tracked us down?
15980,Susan,"okay. wait, if we hated the restaurant, then why are we bringing home food?"
16702,Susan,"""pretty much"" means there is something that you want that you don't have. how can i give it to you if you don't tell me what it is?"
14491,Susan,"bonjour. oh, hi, i didn't know that the cooking lesson was gonna be a group activity. well, the more the merrier, right? as long as nobody makes fun of my lousy crepes. how come i'm the only one wearing the apron?"
14892,Susan,"no, i made the plumber furious. that is definitely over. so there will be no gloating from me."
17977,Susan,"look, i know i said that m.j. was a star student, but the truth is, he's one of those kids that needs extra attention. the classes at his school are way too big, and i see him getting lost in the shuffle. and if he gets lost now--my ex-husband is doing everything that he can, and i need to know that i am, too. i will serve lunches. i will be a janitor. anything. but i am not walking out on my son's future."
15058,Susan,"well, that's not what we're saying."
18281,Susan,not that lonely.
16502,Susan,i told you--hurt and betrayed.
15828,Susan,are you serious?
13812,Susan,ow! oh!
16372,Susan,what?! you said you played water polo!
17727,Susan,jackson. thank god. where's mike?
15312,Susan,"nurse hisel,i can explain."
13491,Susan,"okay, i gotta break the ice here. so you're in counselling, big deal. you want humiliation? i'll give you humiliation. i locked myself out of my house stark naked and got caught by mike."
16400,Susan,"not mine, okay? that way, we can use it when we visit."
13889,Susan,you walked out on your family.
15425,Susan,"oh.well,why is your father keeping this?"
17615,Susan,can't we just keep going the way we are?
16790,Susan,"well, i'd better warn you. i may have to work the shoulders. ba-boom, ba-boom, mmm."
16216,Susan,zach young? our zach young? how does he afford diamonds?
15139,Susan,"your nurse wouldn't let me see you,and i--really wanted to see you,so i sort of faked all my symptoms.the dizziness,the chills,you know,all of it."
15365,Susan,"oh,ah,okay.i made it."
16690,Susan,yeah.
15585,Susan,"um-- no, that's okay.they're fine."
16116,Susan,what?
14883,Susan,"oh. well, come on in."
17323,Susan,"he's a guy who--""killed six, then self."" well, i give up. he's not gonna get a name. when we want him to come, we'll just whistle and say, ""here, boy."""
17565,Susan,"well, it's hard for me, too. i miss things when he's with you. and i--am trying to come to terms with my guilt, because--i have to."
14602,Susan,so it looks like mary alice killed zach's birth mother in order to keep her from taking zach away.
16521,Susan,"probably weren't expecting to see me, huh?"
16626,Susan,i don't. i was just on my way to apologize to you.
14389,Susan,thanks.
13368,Susan,"yeah. yeah, but she's fine now. everything's fine now."
15013,Susan,"oh, come on, just guess. you can tell."
16330,Susan,just take the robe off. and whatever you have on underneath--consider that yours.
14809,Susan,"oh, my god!"
16434,Susan,"mmm! god, that is so good!"
17322,Susan,"oh, give me that. well, we need new inspiration. ooh. riley."
13407,Susan,zach? is your dad home? i need to talk to him.
13859,Susan,"oh, candles, candles!"
16031,Susan,"well, that explains why he was a little cold to me this morning."
14630,Susan,so how have you been doing?
17537,Susan,so you're totally fine with that drawing?
14494,Susan,"okay, i'll keep it warm for you."
14804,Susan,"you'll never lose my friendship, though. i mean that."
13970,Susan,"i, i'm sorry for what happened. it must be really hard, not knowing who did it, or why. you must feel helpless."
14309,Susan,are you alright?
16485,Susan,rip 'em!
15111,Susan,why not?you said he was nice.
14854,Susan,hey!
15719,Susan,jane looked cold.
14705,Susan,"it was not murder, it was manslaughter, and that's totally different. mike and i aren't even living together, and he cares about julie."
14709,Susan,"i'll be right back."" ""oh, um, i'm just gonna need a couple of seconds, so feel free to pray."
18382,Susan,"okay. here, m.j."
17648,Susan,and knowing we're not gonna have sex takes all the pressure off.
16110,Susan,"oh. well, that's too bad. well, no harm done then, huh?"
16236,Susan,"uh, sweetie--i don't think she's gonna make it that long."
17616,Susan,we had an agreement to keep things casual.
17580,Susan,"i don't know. um--i'm sort of going through a difficult transition in my life right now. i need a change. uh, i was thinking--taupe."
14219,Susan,yes. what if it just a bunch of far-fetched stories.
14569,Susan,emphasize the motion detectors.
17976,Susan,"yes. right. no, wrong."
16003,Susan,how did that come up?
14036,Susan,maybe.
17941,Susan,"yeah. he bit his teacher, huh? they had that problem with their older boy, toby. it's a family of biters."
17487,Susan,"well, she is going to get a big surprise, because your daddy is about to turn you into a killing machine."
15678,Susan,"so--about that ring you bought, is there anything particular you'd like to ask me?"
18201,Susan,"hey. i'm on my way to work, but i just wanted to bring you these. uh, chicken salad sandwiches, which i did not make. i bought. i learned my lesson from the casserole."
13785,Susan,"i just came over to say i'm sorry, and i'll pay for all the damage."
15491,Susan,and i regret everything that came of it!
17421,Susan,"they were a mother and a child. she was a mother, just like me--with a child just like ours. and if it weren't for us, they would still be alive."
16949,Susan,"hey, lynette."
14728,Susan,you know?
15172,Susan,"well, neither am i.i've got 35 years on that cow."
18378,Susan,okay. it's no big deal.
15068,Susan,"you know,despite what i did--sending zach away,i want you two to connect.i hope you know that."
15991,Susan,"julie mayer, you get back here! you're grounded, remember?! edie britt, i wanna talk to you."
15100,Susan,dr. ron--i need you to pretend there's something wrong with me and admit me for the night.
16376,Susan,"look, there's somebody on the shore! it's mike! he's here."
13806,Susan,"well, open! open, open, open! he could have said something about dana!"
17079,Susan,and you're kind of yelling at me-also a problem.
17436,Susan,"well, when you meet him for the second time, you can tell him that. he's picking you up here tomorrow night."
17891,Susan,it's just-- now i get it.
15851,Susan,"is something wrong? you, you don't seem happy to see me."
15904,Susan,i just--i just don't think that's a good idea.
18079,Susan,i don't remember.
17311,Susan,"he sure does, but i want mine first."
16807,Susan,"look, i get that you're upset."
15649,Susan,"they're just ants, and they're tiny.of course, they do outnumber me."
15291,Susan,oh.
14781,Susan,"last week, when mike and i went to the park searching for zach, i sort of found him."
17230,Susan,take a step back from what? he tried to murder you.
17574,Susan,"hi, guys. welcome to the party."
15652,Susan,"well, sometimes i say things i don't mean. i blame it on my frequent exposure to ant spray."
13644,Susan,"i'd rather take my chances on the street, thank you very much."
13815,Susan,"gabrielle, he's in high school, and, it's illegal, and you're married. if carlos found out, this would kill him."
16977,Susan,so you killed him?
16215,Susan,what?
15542,Susan,"well,wait.why would you do that?"
15258,Susan,"thanks,hon.that really helps.okay,now i want you to go over and slip this ring to your father.and just so you know,if edie catches you,i'm expecting you to swallow it."
14613,Susan,forbidden!
15173,Susan,i'm sorry.i don't mean this to sound the wrong way. i just--i would be more comfortable with an experienced surgeon.
15099,Susan,"dr. mccready,can i talk to you about my head?away from--the draft?"
14659,Susan,"no, i won't!"
17583,Susan,"i was not born yesterday, pal. you're coming on to me."
16150,Susan,it's me again. you should also know that orson spent a year in an asylum.
17275,Susan,"a fount of wisdom, your meemaw. well--i really appreciate this. thanks, adele."
16182,Susan,yes. that's right. a condom alone will not protect you.
13960,Susan,did i come at a bad time?
16225,Susan,"ian, i'm sorry, too. we've got to stop fighting like this."
17137,Susan,"i wanted to bring flowers, and i was shot down. that's all i'm saying."
14860,Susan,"mike, stop."
18165,Susan,you should leave now.
15709,Susan,so you were very mysterious on the phone.why did you want to have lunch?
17326,Susan,"oh, i'm so sorry. i know how much you loved him."
18409,Susan,"okay. just stop talking. john, how old are you?"
17952,Susan,what about that big job you just did for the last three months? what did you do with that money?
14725,Susan,yeah?
14250,Susan,"thank you. i know, i'm going to. it's on the top of my list."
18250,Susan,"okay. i just had my car detailed, so i should probably go."
16801,Susan,i'm pregnant.
15122,Susan,"yeah,but now that i think about it,i bet it's just all the coffee i drink.i drink way too much coffee.do you like to drink coffee?"
16566,Susan,"oh, it's a face mask. it's lavender and honey. you want some?"
15263,Susan,"no,no. i'm okay.i-i'm just-- surprised.well,congratulations.what makes you think he's gonna propose?"
17933,Susan,"hey, i am happy for you. it's just, uh--this is gonna sound crazy."
14048,Susan,"paul, i am so sorry."
16788,Susan,"so it's not my imagination. they're bigger, right?"
15102,Susan,"that man is the most obnoxious,offensive,annoying human being.and you're looking at me like i'm crazy right now,but i will be if i spend one more second with him.so you gotta help me.you gotta do something."
16267,Susan,"i thought after we got through this really--painful day, things would start to get better. i thought i could be more a part of your world. now all your friends and family are just gonna think of me as the crazy lady from jane's funeral. oh, god. oh, ian. okay, this is not supposed to be about me. you should be upstairs--saying good-bye. i'm just gonna hide out here with the departed until everybody leaves."
15332,Susan,mike is love. mmm.
16954,Susan,"oh, my god. that's great!"
17912,Susan,i thought that was clear.
17397,Susan,you know--this is why it's taking four months to get my house painted.
16768,Susan,"uh, we--i mean, you both make a-a good case. um--but i think i'm gonna have to agree with, uh--and you know i love you both--"
15515,Susan,you know what?it is her.
14029,Susan,mrs. van de kamp needed volunteers. she begged me.
16511,Susan,"oh. well, that's a relief."
14825,Susan,mom.
16842,Susan,right.
15256,Susan,yeah.wednesdays are becoming very popular with brides.it's like the new saturday.
15368,Susan,that smarts! aah!
15354,Susan,"because i panicked,okay?dr. ron hadn't come into see me since the operation and i was feeling insecure and--yes,go ahead.you may resume laughing."
13845,Susan,"oh, how awful!"
16230,Susan,no. what about them?
16892,Susan,nuts?
17347,Susan,we should talk.
15007,Susan,how do you think he's gonna react?
13835,Susan,so what? you obviously don't love him.
15978,Susan,wait. julie's gonna know we came home early from the restaurant to check up on her. i don't want her to think i'm overprotective and clingy.
16190,Susan,"no, you cannot borrow it."
13763,Susan,"and then i opened the cabinet and there was all this money in it. i mean, there was wads of it."
13339,Susan,tell me again why i fought for custody of you?
18196,Susan,that's weird.
16627,Susan,you don't have to.
14757,Susan,"yeah. now that you know he's okay, you should go to him. he'll want to take care of you. that's what parents do. let me help. how much money do you think you'll need to get to utah?"
13574,Susan,what?
14471,Susan,it was self defence.
14945,Susan,"well, there's no record of anyone with my dad's name in the armed services."
17486,Susan,hey! you leave him alone. oh! honey! is that who's been picking on you? juanita solis?
16418,Susan,"no, no, i got it. oh, wait. here we go."
15107,Susan,"great,she caught me staring."
14016,Susan,she's only fourteen!
13414,Susan,of course.
16493,Susan,say you're sorry.
17353,Susan,shh!
16903,Susan,"well, long enough for them to worry. you know, the more they worry, the more i'm a hero. get it?"
14075,Susan,what if he doesn't?
17465,Susan,he said that?
14696,Susan,that is so not true!
14609,Susan,"that's edie's paper, and this is edie's house!"
15636,Susan,"honey, i am trying my hardest to stand on my own two feet. all right, i've got six book proposals in the works.i'm gonna try to supervise the rebuilding of this house, but you know, i can't do it without your support. and i want you to be proud of me."
13821,Susan,listen to me. there is no future for you and gabrielle. she's not going to divorce carlos and run away with you.
15686,Susan,we're in.
14927,Susan,you're right. he made his choice.
13729,Susan,"mike! what a small, small world."
17187,Susan,oh. good morning. love what you're wearing.
13664,Susan,hi.
14989,Susan,i just wanted to see if you were okay.
17185,Susan,"then you came down here and you couldn't remember what it was. that happens to me all the time. well, the baby is insisting that i eat the last piece of"
14288,Susan,why would he shove you?
16043,Susan,"no, i just, um--well, all i really needed was just a little-- little drawer, and, uh--this is just so far away and what is that smell?"
15022,Susan,but you were with a prostitute.
15807,Susan,i'm with a client. take a number.
16533,Susan,"ian, i love you."
16580,Susan,"mike, what day is today?"
14321,Susan,why was she hitting you?
16681,Susan,and--break!
18027,Susan,"hey, did you manage to keep that antler chandelier out of here?"
14293,Susan,"well, that's because you tell people that."
17670,Susan,no. it's sex time!
13860,Susan,"mike? mike, is that you? i'm up here!"
16895,Susan,"okay, here's the thing. i'm a really crappy baker. to give you something that i made myself would be like an insult, so "
15930,Susan,susan.
15754,Susan,"hi, my name's susan mayer. your neighbor told me i could find you here."
17078,Susan,"what's the problem? let's see. you lied to me. uh, your drug dealer almost dated my daughter. you lied to me some more, and then i find out that you hit up my best friend's husband for more pills."
15279,Susan,i can't believe you thought i was jealous.it's not like i still have feelings for you anymore.
15243,Susan,"uh,is that really necessary?i mean,do we have to do the whole ring thing?"
17063,Susan,"yeah, and-and we don't need to say good-bye anyway, 'cause we're gonna see you real soon."
16390,Susan,"well, he's busy. isn't he debating the mayor tonight?"
17961,Susan,"oh, you know what? i'm actually still worried about the side door. do you think you could check that, too?"
15198,Susan,"well, what? i'm desperate here.do you have any other ideas?"
14907,Susan,"okay, there is a good explanation for what happened."
16054,Susan,i get it. as much as i have tried to pretend that it's just you and me. there's three of us in this relationship.
15674,Susan,"oh, my-- ohh!karl, are you okay?are you okay?let me see.oh, my god."
18152,Susan,"no, you're being immoral. you're committing adultery."
16601,Susan,what?
16612,Susan,"in this town in wedding season? yeah, i do. you might as well have used my caterer and my swing band."""
15782,Susan,"oh, ah, no, no.i should take the guest room because i am the guest."
18272,Susan,we're not gonna be able to make it this weekend. i'm kind of getting married.
16142,Susan,hello?
14646,Susan,"hey, edie."
15945,Susan,"okay, i'm gonna need some help with this big baby. go! zip, zip, zip!"
15988,Susan,"yeah? well, i choose to ground you. two weeks, baby."
14197,Susan,"oh, my god -- angela."
15927,Susan,"please, keep the food references to a minimum."
13774,Susan,"wait! wait! no! wait, don't, don't go! wait, i have an idea. here! here! here! here, grab the towel, bongo! come on, grab the other end! come on, boy! that's it! get the other end! come on, bongo! pull the other end! come on, bongo! what are you doing? bongo, over here!"
16938,Susan,"i would love to, but--"
15593,Susan,"you know, it's late.why don't you, uh,go to bed and, you know,let julie and i help you with that in the morning?"
15809,Susan,don't push it.
14266,Susan,"well, no, he didn't."
16800,Susan,"oh, my god! i'm not a stripper."
16645,Susan,"i mean, what could i say?"
16613,Susan,"oh, my god. did you steal my whole wedding?"
16526,Susan,"oh, i'm gonna lock up down here. why don't you go upstairs and warm up the bed?"
14669,Susan,i want you to be happy. i even sort of want edie to be happy.
17193,Susan,"i know when i'm dreaming, and this really happened. why else would i be sponging butt prints off my stool?"
16929,Susan,come on. it's 6:00 a.m. what is that?
16408,Susan,"well, you don't have to trust mike! you have to trust me, and you don't! that's what going to england's about, isn't it? you're just trying to get me away from mike. well, you know what? screw it. i'm not going. and if you ever bring up his name again, we're over. got it? over!"
17553,Susan,"oh! of what? you're 3 inches off the ground. you're completely padded. so just do what i say--wobble, wobble. ""daddy, look at me!"" crash."
14808,Susan,no! there has not been and there never will be.
17195,Susan,"oh, really? you just happened to stumble naked into my front yard?"
14676,Susan,"oh, i'm being nice. i could have him arrested. i mean, don't get me wrong. i am all for julie spending time with karl. he is still her dad, and she loves him."
17951,Susan,"well, we've gotta do something. my editor just quit, and my books are not exactly flying off the shelves. could you pick up some extra shifts?"
16385,Susan,"but we were in a bit of a jam there, and--i don't think you should be embarrassed for needing a little help."
16139,Susan,"good.uh, his name is orson hodge, and he had an affair with the woman that you think mike delfino killed."
15864,Susan,hi. you're new. where's marcy?
16002,Susan,what?
15675,Susan,can you sit up?
17634,Susan,i don't?
13827,Susan,"helen, helen, you're here! did they tell you about the change in lineup? i'm going to go last if that's okay."
14610,Susan,"did you spend the night with edie? oh, my god!"
15065,Susan,i thought you'd be happy about it.i thought that's what you wanted.
16869,Susan,"oh, are you kidding? it's the first baby i've had in 17 years. you know, i could not possibly be more freaked out. this morning, i caught mike building a crib."
14425,Susan,"don't worry, we will be."
14986,Susan,mr. prudy!
17824,Susan,"this is so fun! i haven't been out in ages. tonight, i am gonna--boogie-oogie-oogie--"
15299,Susan,of course i do.he's smart and funny and kind.
14112,Susan,i said no.
17637,Susan,we just have so much baggage. i wish we could start over. can we start over?
15946,Susan,"it's my first time in paris. i want it to be magical, and that means accessories, so back off."
14180,Susan,i'm sorry. it's just so hard to find a guy like mike. i know in my heart he didn't kill mrs. huber.
16373,Susan,how can you not know how to swim? didn't you go to summer camp?
17263,Susan,"just drop the act. you are so loving this. you ended up with the miss america with a law degree, and i ended up with the pillhead plumber. bravo. damn it! why won't this unroll?"
14206,Susan,you lied to me.
15383,Susan,"i deserved it,believe me.after what i did--god,this is such a mess.he won't even return my phone calls."
14740,Susan,but then i got hungry.
13455,Susan,"it's tomorrow night, so if you could just keep julie an extra day."
14277,Susan,let's go inside and call the insurance company.
15476,Susan,"wow.why did you change your mind?i mean,i hope it wasn't because of me,because i told you--"
14652,Susan,"actually, i'm glad that you shared that, because here's a tidbit for you. karl said he's still in love with me."
15066,Susan,and he doesn't want you anywhere near him.
14960,Susan,"oh, my god. do you know where he is?"
14797,Susan,can't.
13917,Susan,"what? i loathe karl, and the postman will back me up on that, too."
18394,Susan,mike!
17665,Susan,"okay, do you know how sad it makes me to know that you only braised it to boink me? you're supposed to be asking me questions. the point of all this was to get to know each other better."
14711,Susan,"well, like i said, i'm sorry. i wish it could be you up there."
17136,Susan,the jam was bree's idea.
18255,Susan,i have to go upstairs.
14791,Susan,there's no electricity.
15468,Susan,karl--uh-oh!
17170,Susan,"oh, nice try, timmy. like i'm really going to believe that. shame on you. just-- shame! what do you mean, ""old feelings""?"
14316,Susan,"mom, don't go. mom, come back. i need to. we're good, right?"
17068,Susan,"no. no, you didn't do anything wrong. thanks for the supplies."
18072,Susan,"well, i mean it. anyone would be lucky to have you. you are a catch. jeez. how did it get so late? is there a school policy on showing up to work drunk?"
18007,Susan,i don't know how to make paninis.
17094,Susan,"you keep saying that, and it just keeps getting worse."
17520,Susan,maybe you need to get mad more often.
14117,Susan,is the seventh important?
17898,Susan,i wasn't planning to.
15340,Susan,"yes, everyone does know a mike.actually, you're right. i did know a mike in college.we did this play together, ""pippin."" it wasn't very good.anyways, i never thought of him,so you shouldn't be accusing me.i was probably just hallucinating."
15812,Susan,i have never had meaningless sex.
16597,Susan,so forget what julie told you about the wedding being off. it's back on.
13359,Susan,"i can't believe it. this can't be happening. mike can't like edie better than me, he just can't!"
17756,Susan,it's gotta be lisa wallace.
14763,Susan,"well, of course."
15619,Susan,"oh, yeah, that. um--look, i really appreciate the offer,but i think i'm gonna have to pass."
14601,Susan,"no. no, i'm so sorry. i'll, i'll, um, i'll see you around."
17744,Susan,you're dating a friend of mine?
17228,Susan,"and the worst part--all this time, you pretended to be our friend."
18261,Susan,go away! i-i don't want to talk to you.
13428,Susan,"so, you know what? i am gonna go get dessert."
16306,Susan,"oh! oh, s-sorry."
17536,Susan,he does not love jackson more than you. he knows who his father is.
13658,Susan,what's your favourite food?
14229,Susan,aren't you dating edie?
17693,Susan,before that.
14325,Susan,"yeah, i understand. so could you, uh, just go out and apologise?"
16632,Susan,"well, you know, when i married him, karl wasn't karl. and i think that's why i got so mad at you. because ninety-nine percent of me is sure that we're gonna be totally happy. but then what you said--it just stirred up that pesky one percent."
17660,Susan,"well, i'm sorry things aren't going well. but i'm glad you told me. see? we're getting to know each other. and we wouldn't have if we'd spent the whole night in bed."
16157,Susan,"did you seriously think i could sit on information that would exonerate mike? i mean, if you had seen his face in jail the other day--"
17494,Susan,thank you.
15249,Susan,"karl,you are so not allowed to get angry.i mean,i might've been the one to throw away the wedding ring,but you threw away the whole marriage.there was plenty of bad behavior that went on back then,so just get off your high horse.we're on the same page now,so we should just focus on that."
17524,Susan,did i not say 7:00? you missed their little show. m.j. was tooth decay.
14393,Susan,"well, yeah, we did. we were just looking. it doesn't matter, it was dumb."
16832,Susan,"mm. um, bree's home. i'll be right back."
16558,Susan,cool. how do i get one of those?
14218,Susan,i just can't.
14984,Susan,"back in the sixties, you had a brief relationship with a young girl, sophie bremmer. she got pregnant and had a baby and that baby was me,which makes you my father. hi."
17612,Susan,poor karen. i hope she's okay.
18046,Susan,"why not? i mean, you loved that painting until you found out that i did it, and then you acted totally petty."
16224,Susan,"oh, 'cause he's a great kid, and he's gonna want to help mike--and you're not gonna be wearing a bra when you ask him out."
18117,Susan,that is not true!
15010,Susan,"that was just the heat of the moment, and once you get to know me, you'll understand that i am not the kind of person who could ever, ever resort to blackmail."
17074,Susan,"thank you. finally, some sanity."
13490,Susan,"well, you're probably not wearing the right shoes."
15358,Susan,"no,no. i got it,i got it."
15884,Susan,"mike, why are you being this way?"
14365,Susan,"mother, don't you think it's getting a little late?"
13451,Susan,"no, it's sort of a way to honour mary alice. it was so important to her."
16720,Susan,"um,sometimes.but mike's a big spooner.he's like sleeping with a hibachi."
16610,Susan,i wanna see those flowers.
13333,Susan,what?
13559,Susan,technically we have nothing to be ashamed about.
16217,Susan,"yeah, i thought it was in a trust, and he couldn't touch it."
16196,Susan,don't you walk away from me!
16448,Susan,sorry.
16642,Susan,"and she kept saying, please, let me make it up to you!"
15436,Susan,i just saw edie drive off.how long is she gonna be gone?
16572,Susan,you don't even know me. how dare you talk to me like that?
14262,Susan,"well, excuse me, but that, that kinda makes it sound like it was my fault. you can't possibly blame me. i'm not the one who fired you."
16652,Susan,"listen.we need to talk. i spoke to mike, and, uh, he's just not really into the whole double wedding thing."
17558,Susan,"oh, will you stop? the doctor said it was just a sprain."
14382,Susan,"julie, what is zach doing out there? i thought i told you not to speak to him anymore?"
16379,Susan,"what, you've never heard of a midnight snack? unless you can think of something else that i can nibble on."
13351,Susan,"that's it, just stuff the hair down."
15222,Susan,"oh, yes. no, no,i do need insurance.i just don't have cancer.i have a-- wandering spleen."
17069,Susan,"orson, we need to talk."
14172,Susan,why?
15815,Susan,"why? you know, every time we do, we just get angry."
15089,Susan,"well, i told him everything i know,which wasn't much."
17737,Susan,"well, i did just give blood. oh!"
13749,Susan,"wow, that's quite a pitching arm you've got there."
13802,Susan,you just told me everything i need to know.
13316,Susan,"you'll love this, he said it doesn't mean anything, it was just sex."
15162,Susan,"no?so--we're talking surgery?yeah, well, i guess i can handle that.people get cut open every day."
16339,Susan,"they weren't all raw. i was trying to spell ""mike,"" and the ""m"" was goopy, but the ""ike"" was delicious. you loved it."
17884,Susan,"have you ever looked in your mirror, edie? you're famous for the number of men you've conquered."
16363,Susan,i saw you watching us.we were just talking.
17528,Susan,"because--mike and i are divorced, so that's why--it was supposed to be a picture of the family, so you should've put your daddy in it."
14378,Susan,what was that?
14972,Susan,soon. i don't wanna ambush him. i'm gonna ease into it.
17688,Susan,i know what's going on. let me enjoy my denial.
15157,Susan,a-and you're stopping yourself why?
16510,Susan,"yeah, only i didn't know edie was gonna have the party in a park. what if gaby see us?"
17790,Susan,yeah. i got it.
16535,Susan,"oh, poor mr. henley. he does seem to be getting worse. thanks for stopping by."
14644,Susan,even at two o'clock in the morning? 'cause that's kind of hard to miss.
14925,Susan,you won?
18138,Susan,"uh, you think i'm homeless. oh, no, no, no. no, i live here. i-i can prove it. i know exactly what's in this garbage bag. um, empty carton of eggs, coffee grinds, shampoo bottle--"
13925,Susan,"yay! oh, you guys were fantastic."
16551,Susan,yep.
17746,Susan,i don't understand. carlos might get his sight back. you should be thrilled.
13930,Susan,only when i'm alone.
13549,Susan,"you can see from the postmark, mary alice probably got it the day she died."
13935,Susan,what do you mean?
15238,Susan,i know.i was listening to you.
17655,Susan,mm. now you tell me something i don't know about you.
15082,Susan,"oh!okay, write that down--nine!"
18361,Susan,"i was thinking about what you said, and you were right. it really would do me good to get out of here for a few days"
13470,Susan,"you know, i've lived with this bitterness so long, i think i'd be lonely without it."
17833,Susan,what does that mean?
17380,Susan,"well--i spend more time with me than you do, and i'm a mess."
14414,Susan,are you okay?
14122,Susan,how did you know?
18381,Susan,"um, can't we find a gas station or maybe a diner?"
14506,Susan,"no, no, it wasn't."
14536,Susan,why?
18194,Susan,how'd that go?
18045,Susan,hold on. i'm sorry. but neither of us exactly gets a gold star for model behavior.
15644,Susan,oh.
14932,Susan,"oh. i hope that's not just because of us not being us anymore. i mean, we could be together at a wedding and it wouldn't have to be weird."
15371,Susan,ohh!
18168,Susan,"lynette, don't look at edie."
15813,Susan,"don't judge me, mr. virgin--plus one!"
15437,Susan,move.
17542,Susan,"i know! you did great! jackson, can i see you a sec?"
16698,Susan,"you are happy,right?"
17279,Susan,don't even know what they are.
15794,Susan,are you saying that jane is the only woman you ever--
17177,Susan,so-- this man-- who do you think it was?
17988,Susan,"okay, sure. uh, where's m.j.?"
13759,Susan,"oh, never mind! we'll just find them ourselves. we'll go find them ourselves."
14260,Susan,"no, we didn't. you know i just said what you wanted to hear because you guilted me into it."
16047,Susan,"fine. fine, fine, fine, fine."
17416,Susan,okay.
13573,Susan,"well, don't just run off. come and hang out with us."
14005,Susan,you're not?
14694,Susan,"well, what makes you so sure i don't have talent?"
15607,Susan,what?no!
16039,Susan,"that was good. you. i wanna party with you. hey, i was thinking this afternoon maybe we could go look for that drawer."
16700,Susan,"i watch you sometimes,and you seem very, disconnected,like something's missing."
16464,Susan,you bet me in a game of poker?
14952,Susan,i need to you tell me the truth about my father.
15690,Susan,"you would think so, but, no, it doesn't."
17297,Susan,"oh, my god! my water broke."
17243,Susan,"hello, karl."
17792,Susan,"oh, looky there. lou gehrig."
15306,Susan,ow! ow!
13522,Susan,so i guess i'll just head back home.. bye.
13527,Susan,what's so funny?
15552,Susan,"yes,honey!gus the mailman is here!he's using the bathroom.he'll be down in a minute.oh! darn it.guess we'll have to take a rain check,huh?"
16683,Susan,"okay, i got you some appetizers to tide you over. we have mini quiches and beef satay and something called crystal coast shrimp with grits, but it's mostly just grits 'cause i ate all the shrimp on my way over. mike?"
13583,Susan,"i will keep my lawn looking nice. and i will make sure that my music isn't playing too loud and if i get some of your mail. heck, i'll run it right over, because that's what good neighbours do. but from now on, when i run into you on the street and i say ""good morning, mrs huber"" or ""how are you, mrs huber"" just know that inside i am quietly but decidedly hating your guts."
14025,Susan,"this is easy for you. you're the father of the boy. i'm the mother of the girl. you know, if things get out of hand--"
15438,Susan,you mauled me in edie's bed last night.i think that deserves a conversation.
14509,Susan,"gabby, the woman killed herself.something must have been going on."
17010,Susan,i knew it. i'm so happy.
16692,Susan,"and just so you know, you'll be paying for those and the lights and the flowers."
15036,Susan,oh! i guess not.
16302,Susan,no.
13367,Susan,"i, i thought you were-- um. where were you?"
13810,Susan,"hey, do you need any help?"
13699,Susan,"there wasn't enough time. he did say one thing that was kind of mysterious. he said something happened to someone named dana, and that he could never ever talk about it."""
13887,Susan,"well, um, he's got a smile that's to die for, and don't get me started on his tattoo."
17272,Susan,wow. it's all recipes.
18185,Susan,one of a kind.
17682,Susan,"i can't believe i ever thought you didn't know me. well, i guess i should let you finish this. i'm sort of missing hands."
16495,Susan,"say, ""i'm a rude, arrogant bastard who needs to treat women with courtesy and respect!"""
17084,Susan,"uh, i think i just twisted my ankle, but i would like to get checked out anyway."
15972,Susan,right.
18074,Susan,it's a date.
13817,Susan,"yes it is. it's about me, and about every other person who was screwed over by somebody they loved. when karl ran off with brandy, you saw what a basket case i was. i was crying, i, i was tearing up his clothes, i couldn't get out of bed all day. you were right there. how could you do the same thing?"
17128,Susan,"oh, no, don't get me wrong. i mean, i think it's great. you should grab love wherever you can find it. who cares if your friends think that you're paying for it?"
13539,Susan,"by the way, if i didn't make it clear yesterday, i absolutely did not do that thing that you accused me of doing."
17899,Susan,i won't.
14272,Susan,"mom, mike and i aren't together anymore."
17092,Susan,just a mild sprain. how you doing?
16524,Susan,"i'm sorry, mike."
16916,Susan,oh. what if we take it to my cleaners?
16291,Susan,"ian, oh, you can't be serious. oh, oh, that's just--too much. it's huge."
14098,Susan,i'm so sorry.
14873,Susan,i'm fine. you got any pie?
15894,Susan,"damn straight! you lie, you cheat, you scheme! you ruin people's relationships! i mean, how do you sleep at night?"
15487,Susan,"so if edie doesn't know,then that means that you just cheated on her-- with me!you made me the other woman!"
14424,Susan,"that's not possible, we don't burn candles during the day."
14201,Susan,you said he was going to be gone.
15869,Susan,you!
13955,Susan,"oh god, no. karl, um, no, what i meant by wonderful was that i wondered inside if i still had feelings for you, if deep down i still loved you--"
17958,Susan,hi. you at home?
14642,Susan,"really? well, it sounds like it's coming from your house. you know, it's like a clanging, clanging."
15015,Susan,you haven't even finished your coffee.
15287,Susan,funny. so what about my surgery?
15190,Susan,can't you sugarcoat it a little?
18407,Susan,mike. mike!
13741,Susan,we've been introduced.
15442,Susan,"well,isn't it?"
16738,Susan,is that all you see in our eyes?
16879,Susan,"um, i'm susan. i live next door."
16401,Susan,i don't want sell my house. everybody i love is on this street.
13689,Susan,"hi, i'm susan mayer. i have an appointment to see dr. sicher."
16240,Susan,maybe a little.
16833,Susan,"i need a favor. um, i remember you mentioning that you liked your obstetrician. can i get his number?"
16380,Susan,it's a thank-you gift for mike.
13605,Susan,"oh!uh, you seem like a really sweet guy, in an interesting line of work. but i um i'm not really available."
17653,Susan,"you're just guessing. it's ""panties."""
17586,Susan,you said you liked it.
17116,Susan,this has just replaced your birth as the best day of my life.
14931,Susan,"hey, mike. so my mom's wedding is in a couple days, and i know you sent back that little card saying you were coming and that you preferred beef, which, actually i changed to fish for you 'cause i tasted the beef. anyways, i know that was before we, you know--"
15061,Susan,uh--oh!
13378,Susan,"well, isn't it worse to be in the dark, imagining she did all these horrible things?"
14085,Susan,"i mean, i understand why you would want to have kids, but that chapter of my life is just closed. i don't think i can go back there. and so, you know, given the way i feel and given the way i think you feel--"
16037,Susan,"yeah, rupe, i hope we can be good friends, 'cause you're gonna be seeing lots more of me."
16665,Susan,"yeah, but you have to give people a choice. don't you think a chocolate fountain would be elegant?"
14643,Susan,"there! there, that was it. did you hear it?"
17598,Susan,"no, uh-- it's fantastic."
14631,Susan,"sure, what is it?"
15628,Susan,but don't cross the street!just tell the neighbor that your mommy's stuck in a big truck!
17153,Susan,"no, that's okay. it can wait."
14344,Susan,"mom, would you please not flirt with the ice cream man."
14301,Susan,okay girls.
18293,Susan,"well, look, maybe--i could talk to mike. i could see if we could work something out."
16890,Susan,"that's fine, and once they like me, they can keep to themselves all they damn well please."
16838,Susan,you don't remember?
14039,Susan,i'd love to.
13405,Susan,"oh, no, no. no, edie's definitely a carnivore."
16085,Susan,oh.
16384,Susan,"okay, that's a good point."
15272,Susan,"oh,yes.you know,this whole fake marriage thing was okay when nobody was getting hurt.what are we doing? it's a lie!i lost mike over a lie,and now i'm doing the same thing to dr. ron,and--and look at edie.she was devastated.i don't think i can go through with this."
14319,Susan,she said she won't come in until you go out and apologise to her.
15124,Susan,"oh,oh,not that often.i probably just need a good massage."
14051,Susan,she's in the shower.
17339,Susan,"hello, maynard. i love you, maynard. my sweet little-- may may. mamie. nerd."
15483,Susan,"hello?oh,hi,edie.uh--yeah,he's here.hold on. how does she know you're here?"
16423,Susan,"well, ian, you've tasted my cooking. it's not a thank-you. it's revenge."
14194,Susan,i'm serious. there's something about this house that's just so cold and creepy. you couldn't tell when mary alice was alive. she just brought so much warmth and light. now there's something--i can just taste it. can't you sense it?
16451,Susan,don't say that.
16770,Susan,"well, it sounds like this party could be on the wild side, and it is starting very late."
17258,Susan,"yeah, but that doesn't mean you have to go blurting all our deepest, darkest secrets."
14994,Susan,"it's not like i want an invitation to thanksgiving. i just wanna have coffee, or a lunch now and then."
13386,Susan,oooh.
16158,Susan,yeah. i--just to tell him about the lawyer. i know that mike is innocent.
14129,Susan,hi.
13772,Susan,"hello! i need help, i'm up here, i'm trapped in the floor, hello?!"
18277,Susan,"okay. yeah, i guess that could be fun. while our friends are toasting to our everlasting happiness, we can yell, ""surprise! it's all a sham! thanks for the crock-pot!"""
15144,Susan,the one who called in the mri room?
15639,Susan,"uh, no.have you tried her cell?"
16867,Susan,"oh, no. is everything okay?"
13951,Susan,what are you saying?
13584,Susan,"good evening, mrs huber."
17298,Susan,my water just broke. i'm in labor. we have to go.
15210,Susan,so what changed?
17130,Susan,"okay, i know that it sounds selfish, but i did what i did because i want you to stay."
17438,Susan,"oh, hey!"
16776,Susan,why?
14035,Susan,"well, the other day he could have cared less about julie and zach dating, and now, all of a sudden, he shows up at the dance?"
14904,Susan,karl. it'd be so weird.
17096,Susan,no.
16611,Susan,"oh, my god, that's my centerpiece!"
16793,Susan,mm-hmm?
14489,Susan,"look, i feel really bad about deirdre, and i know that you must want to find out who killed her, but if we're gonna move in together, we can't have this stuff hanging over us. you've gotta get rid of it. all of it: the file, the map, the gun, especially the gun and leave this to the police. they're the professionals."
16708,Susan,"oh,my god.this is not little dylan.i'm susan,julie's mom.she is gonna be so excited to see you."
14087,Susan,what?
16266,Susan,"yes, i did. it's just--"
17422,Susan,"it's like you don't care at all, like you feel nothing for those people."
15110,Susan,that's a great idea.you could have him do a background check on the applewhites.
18116,Susan,i told the class to draw something that made them happy. all the other kids drew kittens and rainbows. your son drew small intestines on the end of a stick.
18380,Susan,just hold on a few more minutes.
14604,Susan,you want me back?
15156,Susan,"you know,we've been on three dates,and you just keep acting like a perfect gentleman,and, uh-- it's getting a little old."
13336,Susan,"oh, i'm late for an appointment anyway."
15519,Susan,"yeah,i kind of figured that."
13725,Susan,i'm going to the bathroom and i'm going home. i don't want mike to catch me here.
14545,Susan,"honey, i know about dana."
18322,Susan,he'll be fine.
16538,Susan,"well, that doesn't make sense. mike wouldn't leave without saying good-bye."
17086,Susan,are you okay?
15646,Susan,"oh, hi."
14130,Susan,"now? well, i'm, i'm sorry, my daughter and i were going to go see a movie tonight."
15935,Susan,"hello, carolyn."
14366,Susan,"agh! the perfect capper to the perfect evening, so good night, it's been lovely. and lamont, good luck with all your inventions."
16955,Susan,thanks for everything. thank you.
13834,Susan,why not?
13747,Susan,she's been in a coma ever since she came out of er. nobody knows when or even if she'll wake up.
15768,Susan,really? does that mean you're gonna be getting back together?
17887,Susan,you know-- maybe i do feel incomplete without a man. but i-- wouldn't trade places with you for anything. you wanna know why?
17827,Susan,"hey, jackson. what? really?"
17158,Susan,"oh, i forgot. uh, tim has some questions about the taxes. do you mind talking to him?"
15393,Susan,it poured.i could have murdered that weatherman.
15569,Susan,"no. no, look,the whole neighborhood turned out to help.i'm very popular."
16959,Susan,"what do you mean, ""it's fine now""? he's dead."
17901,Susan,thanks.
17721,Susan,"oh, julie, you're way too young to be this cynical."
16073,Susan,"well, that's the thing. uh, so i was hoping, you know, if you're not too busy--"
16407,Susan,"you're not actually--okay. that's it--i've had it. really, i can't have this conversation one more time. i've done nothing but prove my love to you for the last year and you cannot shut up about mike."
17909,Susan,"look, i know it's quiet here, but i think you'll find there's a real charm to fairview."
15495,Susan,i'm sorry i'm late.
15925,Susan,oh!
14265,Susan,that's not true!
16595,Susan,gaby!
17681,Susan,"that look on my face--i've seen before--in the mirror, when i'm feeling--how do you know about that look?"
13968,Susan,"i'm just, you know, busy. stuff."
16484,Susan,don't soft-pedal it. let 'em know i mean business.
15545,Susan,really?it seems like forever.let me top you off.
14985,Susan,"mr. prudy, i'm sorry. i didn't want to spring it on you like this. where are you going? you see when i found out you were alive, and, and that we both lived in the same city, i just wanted to meet you."
16222,Susan,"okay, i deserve the pimping remark, but let's not pretend that, you know, we're above teenagers. gaby, you're all i've got."
17950,Susan,"okay, you know the problems they're having at his school. and now with all the budget cutbacks--i mean, this place is fabulous."
17534,Susan,"yes, i see. and here, mommy thought we'd agreed to wait till your birthday. crazy mommy."
16972,Susan,"um, yes, the, uh, genetic counselor, um, wanted to know a couple of things. um, i-is there any cancer in your family?"
13514,Susan,"what am i supposed to say to mike, ""i saw you half naked so i thought i'd drop by?"""
15668,Susan,"uh, well, he's not moving in with us."
17404,Susan,"no, of course not. it's just-- complicated."
17395,Susan,really? whose?
16592,Susan,"oh, my god! i had julie call and cancel everyone."
16976,Susan,so you killed him?
16672,Susan,what are you doing?
17687,Susan,"you know, i'm very good at first impressions. i'm gonna like this guy. why is the cab driver handing julie's boyfriend money? why is julie's boyfriend getting back in the cab? and why is the middle-aged cab driver kissing julie?"
17133,Susan,"can i have milk, too?"
17162,Susan,i've gotta go.
16281,Susan,we never really stopped.
18401,Susan,"oh, my god."
14133,Susan,i'm sure i won't be late. bye.
16254,Susan,i sure as hell do.
14723,Susan,"zach's your son, and, and i have julie and you're totally accepted her. i mean, granted, she's been the model child, so far, but she's almost fifteen. she's gonna turn on me any minute. you better be there to help me when it gets ugly."
15844,Susan,"okay, not on purpose, but you did. you were sweet and charming and english.and that's why when my prayers were answered,i was a hundred miles away, naked in someone else's arms.this should never have happened."
15669,Susan,"to be fair, you just had a spare room, and this is a whole house."
16368,Susan,"yeah, it's sudden. my whole life is here. i mean, my friends. you know, julie is still in school--"
17531,Susan,wow! isn't it fantastic?
14541,Susan,"can i at least get you something to eat, zach?"
18110,Susan,"what a lovely rainbow, june. here's a gold star for you. oh, drew, wow! you know, elephants don't have wings, but i like the way you're thinking. hey, evan, what did you draw? that's a lot of red."
15781,Susan,"oh.a guest room.well, that's handy."
16071,Susan,right--like an ambulance.
17329,Susan,"oh, right. maynard. oh, that's awful--that he died."
15509,Susan,"uh-- well, um--then i should just go and let you get started with that."
14150,Susan,julie alexandra mayer!
14511,Susan,hello?
16137,Susan,"take care of yourself, mike."
13475,Susan,"oh. um, okay. here's the thing, karl. i was thinking about what happened in the driveway yesterday. and i just don't wanna, i don't wanna live like this. i don't wanna be that kind of person. and i just thought, if the two of us had a nice calm-i need an apology, karl."
16173,Susan,hi. bye.
16494,Susan,say it!
17291,Susan,"we're not inviting you to poker. we're not talking to you. we're not even gonna wave when you jog by. from now on, you are invisible."
16952,Susan,"exactly, and friends don't put friends in this kind of position. i love you, but you can't ask me to put your kids ahead of my husband."
13796,Susan,"i don't know, but i'm scared. something's very, very wrong."
18327,Susan,so--did the immigration people tell you how they found out about you?
17830,Susan,and he wants me to move there with him.
16773,Susan,"hey, so how's the chemotherapy going?"
14074,Susan,"oh, i can't tell him. this could be a deal breaker. julie, i really love him. i don't want to lose him."
14806,Susan,oh! what the hell are - is wrong with you?!
15526,Susan,how you doing?
13756,Susan,oh? like a hotel room?
16151,Susan,hi. i brought you a bundt cake. don't worry.i didn't make it.
13969,Susan,hi. mrs. mayer. i saw you from across the street. i thought you might need a hand.
15232,Susan,what?
16810,Susan,"please. every time you and mike disagree on something, you give me the look--that pitiful face that says if i don't back you up, i love the other one more."
15591,Susan,guess not.
13366,Susan,mike!
14125,Susan,"no, not really, no. so guess what? i'm your alibi. i told the police that we were together the night that mrs. huber was killed and that i could never forget that night."
14094,Susan,we don't have to talk about that now.
15620,Susan,"yeah.i think it's best. i don't wanna get a rep around here for being a charity case,you know?"
15555,Susan,for keeping edie from smashing my face in.that's the nicest thing anybody ever did for me.
16447,Susan,but he was cleared. all charges dropped. here. eat this.
16514,Susan,ugh. i wish she'd hurry. i'm terrified of snakes.
16508,Susan,stupid?
13911,Susan,"oh! well, that's great!"
16680,Susan,nice save.
17893,Susan,"edie, what the hell?"
16293,Susan,"oh! oh, my! oh, it's so beautiful!"
17052,Susan,what?
17791,Susan,"uh, yeah. it's--round."
16732,Susan,"listen,my last egg could be on its way down the chute at this very moment.if you wanna have kids,you might wanna jump on it right now."
15017,Susan,"well, i, i just want to share more than our dna i, i wanted to have a relationship with you. none of this means anything to you?"
17248,Susan,"there's nothing wrong with that. it shows our respect for lamaze, and, you know, the whole birthing process."
18337,Susan,did mike turn jackson in to immigration?
14254,Susan,"see now. maybe it's the word ""date"" that's throwing me off."
16103,Susan,mike is innocent. i know that in my heart.
18218,Susan,right. i know that. i just was worried about a friend so i forgot. i'm sorry.
14190,Susan,"no, edie, this is our chance. we should just go in for ten minutes."
14057,Susan,"no, i, i just, i think that you should slow things down. i, i, i want you to not see her for awhile."
14291,Susan,i'm sorry.
16962,Susan,"how can it be complicated? he's either dead or alive. does it sound complicated to you, michelle?"
14577,Susan,good. there's a rumor going around that you don't wanna press charges against zach. is that true?
14131,Susan,"uh, let me get my purse."
15388,Susan,hi.
18260,Susan,get out or i will kick your ass back to the canadian border!
18385,Susan,"come on, honey! let's run! let's run!"
17812,Susan,because we have never said it.
17043,Susan,"oh, that's okay. you know, why don't you come back tomorrow to see me, and if julie happens to be here, maybe you can give her some advice on picking out colleges and stuff."
13846,Susan,am i? hmm.
14385,Susan,ow ow.
16650,Susan,hey!
17333,Susan,oh. forgive me. don't look at me like that. his grandfather just died.
17769,Susan,"uh, not good enough. you had a million chances to say something and you didn't. that is just the same as lying to my face. you know, i always thought that the one thing i could depend on you for was honesty. what happened to that?"
17569,Susan,"har har. uh, actually, he's at juanita's watching a dvd. do you want me to call him?"
13804,Susan,trouble at work?
17776,Susan,"m.j. ,hurry up. your dad's here. hey, katherine. what are you doing here?"
18235,Susan,"that's what we said, but it wasn't true. he took the blame for me."
14339,Susan,"i think it's natures little joke, that children ultimately end up parenting their parents."
18306,Susan,"clearly, you've never been married before."
13651,Susan,"thank you,no, i'm on a break. hurry please!"
15155,Susan,do i just repulse you?
18315,Susan,"hey, dave. i was gonna call you."
17147,Susan,these receipts are self-explanatory. i'd even know why i'm here.
18071,Susan,no. i-i will not let you. you are too smart and funny and adorable.
16984,Susan,"well, that's my point. when good people snap, they feel bad about it. your dad doesn't."
14404,Susan,uh!
13924,Susan,"well, here's something. mike told me he loved me."
15417,Susan,exactly how ugly is this gonna get?
17458,Susan,oh. is his name mike delfino? did you room together at liars' college?
14419,Susan,so you mean you and john have still been?
18273,Susan,"oh, just leave the toilet seat up, and the immigration people will totally think we're married."
16717,Susan,sorry.
16183,Susan,so i was in the middle of totally freaking out when julie assured me that she's not having sex. i can't tell you how relieved i was.
14890,Susan,i'm sorry. are you okay?
15510,Susan,oh! uh--okay.
18054,Susan,"i'm missing my small candy dish. i had it last night when you guys were over for dinner, because i remember orson admiring it."
18298,Susan,it depends. jackson and i are only getting married because he needs his green card.
16022,Susan,"all right, oh--but let's make it a quickie 'cause you are wasting water."
17083,Susan,"uh, no."
14515,Susan,"oh, i know. uh, i found mrs. huber's journal in some of mike's stuff, and i think she knew mary alice's secret and was blackmailing her."
14001,Susan,"i was scared that you were sleeping with mike, and so i let myself in, and i, i snuck around, i accidentally knocked a candle over, and the whole, just, i'm so sorry! can you ever forgive me?"
14874,Susan,i can wait.
17493,Susan,really. it's not the first time. juanita's been bullying him.
15164,Susan,"oh, uh, well, um--uh--"
14358,Susan,forget it.
18297,Susan,"uh, well--okay, you know what? mike's probably gonna tell you anyway, so just don't tell anyone else, okay?"
16498,Susan,a very bad day.
15835,Susan,"uh, i, i think that you're sitting on my bra."
15079,Susan,"mike, i'm part of the reason things got so screwed up.i just want a chance to make things right."
14000,Susan,"edie, i burned your house down."
16257,Susan,susan mayer. i'm-- a friend of the family.
17196,Susan,"""mike""? wait. are you sleepwalking? orson. hello?"
16442,Susan,"hi. um, mike, i want you to meet maggie gilroy."
15293,Susan,"oh,it's sort of private."
13610,Susan,blame myself???
15737,Susan,in that case i'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles. is that okay?
17178,Susan,not really.
18405,Susan,mike! mike! mike! stop! no! m.j.! m.j.!
13748,Susan,i hope she wakes soon. maybe she can tell us who was driving that car.
14313,Susan,"no, it's just a nose bleed, she's fine."
16091,Susan,"hey. wow, oh, those are gorgeous."
16591,Susan,"gosh, i just keep thinking there's someone i've forgotten to tell. caterer, band, florist--"
14327,Susan,morty!
17927,Susan,locks.
14463,Susan,you see the thing is. this is probably the last chance for me to find out if i can be with the man i love.
13408,Susan,hey paul.
15341,Susan,damn that nurse hisel!
14501,Susan,he's six cars up. we have to stay this far back or he'll see us.
14537,Susan,she was?
18155,Susan,home.
16087,Susan,what?
17125,Susan,"oh, i'm just gonna visit for a while. so, andrew, we miss you around here, but i bet you love having your own place."
17739,Susan,yeah. but what friend? wait. is this a woman friend?
16673,Susan,it's three o'clock in the morning.
17760,Susan,it's fine. it's--fine.
16017,Susan,so you're not gonna move to new york?
17919,Susan,what do you mean?
15831,Susan,mmm.
17867,Susan,nothing. it's locked. do you have a key?
15277,Susan,nothing. i just--i didn't know that you loved her like that.
17664,Susan,"we are not having sex until date number four, and this is date number two."
16829,Susan,hey. what's this?
17211,Susan,"oh, i just can't control myself like that."
16226,Susan,oh. ian--
13477,Susan,what does that mean?
15868,Susan,"uh, yeah. what is she doing here?"
17394,Susan,edie? is that really you?
15064,Susan,"well, that's great,isn't it?"
13363,Susan,oh-- oh! oh!
17156,Susan,"mm, well, maybe you won't mind doing a little scrubbing when you come home next week."
16056,Susan,you don't have to push jane out to let me in.
15663,Susan,what's the catch?
16703,Susan,this marriage is doomed.
17266,Susan,i know. i just wish i could fast-forward through my life and see that everything ends up okay.
14200,Susan,what was that?
15822,Susan,"if we keep this up, we could stay here till christmas."
16900,Susan,"bup, bup, bup! wait a second."
17613,Susan,"we should probably talk now, huh?"
16675,Susan,"you've been sneaking out while i've been asleep? what are you, ninja plumber?"
15842,Susan,what?
17447,Susan,"you guys were insulting each other. that's good, right?"
18278,Susan,can't i at least tell the girls?
14409,Susan,"no. i'm good, thanks."
18344,Susan,"um, yeah. i--katherine already told me about your big news."
13728,Susan,and why would you root for me?
17850,Susan,yeah. now i can move in with jackson with a clear conscience.bgood. good.
17624,Susan,are we ok?
17172,Susan,"shame on you! his mother trusted me to take care of him, and you swoop in like some swooping, sex-craved--oh, for god sakes, tim! pull up the blanket!"
13459,Susan,we are being as nice as we possibly can to one another.
15422,Susan,a what now?
16025,Susan,loving that idea.
14008,Susan,our poker games?
15049,Susan,you don't have to do this.
15076,Susan,"oh, sorry!are you okay?"
15957,Susan,"oh, that's responsible parenting. stealing whiskey? that's it, young lady. i'm taking you to paris.'"
14811,Susan,why?
14909,Susan,"well, i said it was a good explanation, not a great one."
15824,Susan,shh. do you mind? you're kind of drowning out the bells.
13988,Susan,why would you think i was lying?
18348,Susan,"um, no, thanks. so, look, uh.. i'm sorry if i was a little under-enthusiastic the other day about you and katherine getting married."
14249,Susan,hey!
17295,Susan,"well, you could see how i, as the nude, snoring whore, would think so."
16974,Susan,wonderful. who did you kill?
13530,Susan,"oh, you don't have to apologise about carl. really, carl and i are over. i've moved on."
16578,Susan,the chicken.
17925,Susan,"change the locks, don't talk to me, then leave."
16766,Susan,is it about matt's party?
14571,Susan,my fault?
17813,Susan,we've never looked each other in the eye and said that there is no chance we are ever getting back together.
17087,Susan,are you sure that's all it is?
14675,Susan,"well, i have a court order. it's out of my hands."
14149,Susan,is julie in there? julie mayer?
13975,Susan,i am so screwed.
18102,Susan,"hey, karl."
17048,Susan,oh. he's coming back tomorrow. don't you think he would be perfect for julie?
18264,Susan,what do you want?
18262,Susan,"thanks, but i've reached my maximum allowance for humiliation this week."
14351,Susan,"alright, we get it. she looks young."
13566,Susan,mike!
17203,Susan,"well, if you insist--"
13878,Susan,i had to send zach back. we could have gotten in a lot of trouble.
15778,Susan,"so that's my number and if there's any change in mike's condition, i'm going to the mountains with a friend. and, ah, just in case you were wondering, it's strictly platonic."
18148,Susan,"oh, you met ed?"
16827,Susan,so you were paid a very nice compliment today.
14099,Susan,so?
15672,Susan,"stop it! oh, my--what are you--just stop it!oh, that's enough!just get off! get off! go! go!"
17880,Susan,ron. dr. ron. are we done?
17596,Susan,h-honest? okay.
15378,Susan,"no,ron,don't go!"
14193,Susan,"do you believe in evil, edie?"
15070,Susan,okay.
15535,Susan,"okay,let's try this another way.you are about to unleash a nuclear explosion.lives are going to be ruined."
18048,Susan,"uh, you do. i am here to take my painting back."
14841,Susan,"well, okay--"
16319,Susan,"julie? no, she's at her father's this weekend. is something wrong?"
15979,Susan,"yeah, it's been a week. i'm getting on her nerves."
14738,Susan,"damn it, zach. it's enough already."
17787,Susan,"no, i'm talking about that line you fed her. ""sports illustrated""? what's the issue about, the senior olympics?"
15856,Susan,"so the doctor said i should use as many things as i can to jog your memory. and not just pictures.he said i could use tastes and smells and sounds, so tonight is sounds of the seventies."
13469,Susan,"what, you mean forgive him?"
17167,Susan,"no, katherine, i know what you've been going through emotionally, so you don't have to apologize. and by the way, your boob is out."
14700,Susan,"yep, i am. i think i'm going to make another push for using that pedal. i think it adds grandeur."
13786,Susan,"well, so, in your mind, is the date off?"
13820,Susan,what are you doing here?
14466,Susan,"hi, kendra."
14625,Susan,the one at the piano bar?
16461,Susan,no. it's nothing.
17165,Susan,ugh! get off that poor girl right now!
17369,Susan,"well, yes, but don't forget--it is a huge honor."
18397,Susan,"mike should be here any minute. dave, please. don't hurt mike. it wasn't his fault."
13460,Susan,excuse me. brandy. do you mind?
16804,Susan,"well, of course you don't think it is, because you're knocking back a big cup of-- orange soda."
14476,Susan,"hey there, edie."
14859,Susan,"i, i should have told you right away. i, i know that. but you know now, so can we please talk about it?"
16852,Susan,carlos.
16741,Susan,"no problem.um,what's up?"
14750,Susan,i swear.
13697,Susan,i saw the movie. it was really good.
14499,Susan,"it's not about what's in it, it's about the fact that he had it at all. i would bet you anything he is not going on a plumbing job and we're gonna find out."
15181,Susan,yeah.
13946,Susan,"yeah, me too. and just so you know, i'm sorry for flipping out. i shouldn't let you get to me like that."
15662,Susan,you bought us a house?
13787,Susan,"hold on a minute, now. i started snooping around because i found all that money by accident. and, and then, i found a gun. are you a drug dealer or something?"
18311,Susan,we're getting married.
16462,Susan,no. it--it was days ago.
16458,Susan,"no, i know what they taste like. i'm just torn, okay?"
13440,Susan,"no, it doesn't. not at all."
14707,Susan,i'm sorry you had to witness that.
18414,Susan,what?
14628,Susan,"yeah, i know. come on in."
14155,Susan,"oh, i, okay, i'm, i'm sorry. uh, i'll just, i'm just gonna leave those right there."
18431,Susan,"karl,just stop."
16367,Susan,to london? permanently?
15054,Susan,i'll wait for your call.
13766,Susan,"yeah, and he retired. i try not to take that personally."
17695,Susan,i don't believe so. although i may have blacked out after she told me you were 40. so how does a man your age get married and divorced three times?
15798,Susan,ian.
18339,Susan,mm. shower's off. i guess we'll know in a few seconds.
15090,Susan,i don't know. i saw his face when he looked in the trunk.and he looked just as shocked as i was.
17500,Susan,good boy.
14549,Susan,"uh! ow! oh! bongo, no! bongo! bongo! oh!"
13667,Susan,"that makes sense. still, i just want to make sure you didn't want to keep it, for zach, something to remember his mother by."
14920,Susan,"uh, the big news?"
16299,Susan,"mike, what are you doing here?"
16806,Susan,"yeah, well, boomer likes it."
17768,Susan,"well, she didn't."
18112,Susan,"evan, that's-- kind of a scary picture."
15197,Susan,i'm saying a little prayer.
16399,Susan,my thigh's getting an inkling.
17355,Susan,get out.
16960,Susan,'cause that's what you told me when we first started dating.
13902,Susan,you're not? what happened?
16346,Susan,we got it. just go.
18177,Susan,"god, she is so good at that."
16255,Susan,oops. watch yourself.
17696,Susan,did someone throw rice at you?
13409,Susan,i hope i'm not interrupting.
15470,Susan,that was not a coincidence.
14752,Susan,because there are still people at home who care about you and there's things that you need to know.
16545,Susan,what am i gonna do go hunt him down? i have a daughter. i have responsibilities.
14786,Susan,"well, how can i not? i feel so guilty, i can barely look him in the eye when he talks about zach."
13672,Susan,no. that's why we have to find him. it's the only way we'll know the truth.
18133,Susan,"i don't know, but she is the reason we're on this trip. uh, maybe we could share memories or tell stories."
13403,Susan,yeah.
18241,Susan,"are you kicking us out, tom?"
16883,Susan,"raphael is your dog, of course. you know, 'cause you folks can't have kids. i mean, uh, i mean, of course you can have kids, um, you--you know, because times have changed, and now you're allowed. what a-- nice dog. i should go."
13577,Susan,"yeah. yeah, that's okay ,isn't it, mike?"
18307,Susan,"well, i've been in some real marriages that weren't, so--maybe you're right."
13655,Susan,i don't want to talk about it.
17429,Susan,"edie, is that really you?"
14338,Susan,"i know it's years away. she's youthful and vibrant, thank god. but time flies and one day she won't be able to take care of herself and i'll have to step up."
16710,Susan,"oh,you don't need to do that."
15679,Susan,"okay, that's ridiculous. karl doesn't have me wrapped around anything."
15575,Susan,you weren't supposed to get that.i stole that back from the mailman.
17754,Susan,well--it's about mike.
18376,Susan,"gosh, it feels like we've been driving forever. maybe we should stretch our legs."
17863,Susan,looks like the mailman switched our mail again. do you have mine?
14113,Susan,"you can see boys in a couple years, just not that boy."
18098,Susan,"you know, i don't get why people say that. i-i love pity. pity means someone is trying to understand what you're going through, that they sympathize, and i do."
17991,Susan,"well, uh, thank you very much for helping us out. come on, m.j.. it's time to go."
16975,Susan,uh-huh. okay.
13754,Susan,six is good.
17491,Susan,ah! couple of wusses. i'll handle it myself.
15854,Susan,"oh. okay. right, you, you, um, you sleep. i'll come back tomorrow."
16658,Susan,will you marry me?
13726,Susan,it's not a competition.
15721,Susan,"oh, um, you might want to give jane a sponge bath cause she had a little accident."
16940,Susan,"uh, it's not like i'm pro- katherine. i'm just anti-fountain. oh, don't give me that look. i made her a promise."
13431,Susan,is there anything i can do?
14452,Susan,"if you find out something that's really bad, just try and put a positive spin on it."
14954,Susan,"morty, can, can we just move this along?"
15832,Susan,i thought you said you didn't get reception up here.
15315,Susan,i know. i read the card.
17630,Susan,stay out of this.
