961,Bart,"yeah. well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. it now goes: d,b,a,c."
962,Bart,but dad...
9152,Bart,not our entire relationship. just the stuff i said.
964,Bart,now let's see what we got here.
965,Bart,"ah, my gym shorts."
966,Bart,i'm gonna swim nekkid.
9160,Bart,"smooth and slippery. thank you, zamboni king."
9161,Bart,cue music.
9163,Bart,maybe we should just check out the street performers.
972,Bart,"well, dad, here's my report card. i think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
974,Bart,so i won't get to go to camp?
9169,Bart,la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
978,Bart,"hey, hands off my pickle."
979,Bart,"no, but..."
9173,Bart,isn't this supposed to be my project?
982,Bart,when do we get to see krusty?
983,Bart,"i'm not worried, lis. you know why? because of this..."
984,Bart,the krusty brand seal of approval. you can only find it on products which meet the high personal standards of krusty the clown.
985,Bart,don't we get to roast marshmallows?
9175,Bart,no! stop the hovering!
987,Bart,so did i.
989,Bart,"lisa, i've been thinking it over, and next summer i am getting a job."
995,Bart,"i just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp. can i say ""crappy"" on tv?"
9188,Bart,my plan was to lie. lie like hell. and that's what i did.
997,Bart,"how could you, krusty? i'd never lend my name to an inferior product."
1000,Bart,oh yeah.
9195,Bart,huh. what's this?
9196,Bart,it was a typical day for delivery man avery mann. until...
9197,Bart,you made this?
1010,Bart,"lookin' for a spot of fun with the missus, eh guv'nor?"
9204,Bart,"you know, krabappel just needs to chill out and realize life is cool. but how?"
9205,Bart,"hmm... you know, my dad is a lot more fun after a few beers."
1014,Bart,"lisa, this is neither the time nor the place."
9206,Bart,"maybe mrs. k would be nicer if we ""irish"" up her coffee."
9208,Bart,relax. hazelnut creamer covers all sins.
9209,Bart,you look tired. maybe you need some more coffee.
9211,Bart,"all thanks to... ""the answer""!"
9218,Bart,oh sure... it's sorta on my way home. i can check up on the old girl. she probably landed a job at some fancy-schmancy prep school.
9219,Bart,mrs. k? is everything all right?
1029,Bart,"dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? hubba, hubba."
1034,Bart,"whooo! whooo! dad, do you know anything else about women?"
1035,Bart,"you know, i was just wondering how someone who works in an ice cream store keeps such a trim figure."
9230,Bart,this book uses the ancient power of wanting.
1040,Bart,heel -- toe. heel -- toe. heel -- toe.
9233,Bart,"look, mrs. k, i'm a simpson. and a simpson never gives up until he's tried at least one easy thing. let me help you."
1042,Bart,"lis, as your brother, this is the hardest thing i've ever had to say. you're not ugly."
1045,Bart,"thanks, grampa."
1049,Bart,"i'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to dad, but what pressure?"
9242,Bart,yep. i'm off the hook now.
9243,Bart,"well, i guess i can tell you... 'cause everything worked out for the best..."
9244,Bart,"well, it's funny, really. i'm the one who put booze in your coffee and got you fired."
9245,Bart,please don't kill me.
9247,Bart,noooo!
9255,Bart,"...so you see, it was my fault. i got mrs. krabappel drunk. and then i was gonna do the same thing to zack, but i decided it was better to just tell the truth."
9256,Bart,"doesn't matter, as long as edna gets her job back."
1065,Bart,"please lis, they prefer to be called the living impaired."
1066,Bart,no.
9258,Bart,and there's no hard feelings?
1068,Bart,"dad, you killed the zombie flanders!"
1069,Bart,"kolchak, mannix, banacek, danno!"
9259,Bart,but it's stale.
9262,Bart,"sir, could you sign my program with a swear word?"
9263,Bart,"but mom, i'm winning! look at this! his lunch money!"
1077,Bart,"over the lips and past the gums, look out dentures, here i come."
1078,Bart,"yeah, right. like you're gonna let me go hungry. i'll be eatin' that pizza in five minutes."
9273,Bart,"oh man, now she's writing cutesy things with the ribbon."
9275,Bart,"hit my mom, will ya? well, i'm gonna knock you out and moon your corpse."
1085,Bart,sucker.
1086,Bart,"stick around, mr. bond. things are really starting to ""cook."""
9280,Bart,"listen, you're a smart kid. i bet you like ideas."
1090,Bart,or you could let me go play with milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable mexican sitcoms.
1091,Bart,"jin-gle bells, jin-gle bells..."
9282,Bart,exactly. crisscross! do we have a deal?
1096,Bart,see ya in the funny pages.
1102,Bart,"come on, go nuts."
1104,Bart,"dad, what's the point of this story?"
1109,Bart,be honest.
9303,Bart,a hamburger!
9306,Bart,ow!
1117,Bart,one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court.
1118,Bart,itchy.
9311,Bart,"quit dragging me. when i grow up, i'm gonna drag you around and buy you clothes."
1121,Bart,hmmm!
9323,Bart,"your honor, i'd like to enter something into the record."
9326,Bart,"oh, for cryin' out loud!"
1135,Bart,here's my test.
9327,Bart,snow day!
1138,Bart,see that sock over there? it was his only friend.
1139,Bart,"hello, lisa. here in the dark you won't need those eyes. let me have them."
9331,Bart,huh?
1142,Bart,i fell on my bottom.
9335,Bart,really? does obama know about this?
1145,Bart,"uh, right. do you know what a wet willie is?"
1153,Bart,yes i am. and it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change.
9346,Bart,my dad is such a jerk. i want a brother and he said no.
9347,Bart,"trick 'em, i like it. but how?"
1158,Bart,o-kay.
9353,Bart,"look, i want a baby brother, but i can't get my parents to do it."
9357,Bart,don't you wanna do it?
1169,Bart,"dad, i have some questions about women."
1170,Bart,"dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?"
1181,Bart,my name is jimbo jones and i live at 1094 evergreen terrace.
9374,Bart,there must be some reason no one ever adopted you. is one of your feet a hand?
9376,Bart,"shop it somewhere else, sister."
1185,Bart,"eh, they'll be chewin' on him for a while."
9377,Bart,"dad, this is charlie, my new, um, best friend."
9380,Bart,"uh, he was born with two noses and we hid him away till we could afford to cut one off."
1191,Bart,"can you say ""get bent""?"
9383,Bart,"you're just jealous 'cause now i've got what you've got with maggie, only better because we're dudes with 'tudes!"
1194,Bart,"hey, what was my first word?"
1202,Bart,what were their names?
9396,Bart,the same place eskimos hide from penguins.
9397,Bart,"now charlie, we have to live off what we find in the garbage: banana strings, muffin liners, but it'll be cool, 'cause it's just you and me."
9399,Bart,are you gonna turn us in?
9401,Bart,snow. god's cotton candy.
9404,Bart,"point and shoot, bro. point and shoot."
9406,Bart,i'm here to visit charlie.

1239,Bart,"mom, dad, she can talk! say it again, lis."
9431,Bart,i concur.
9434,Bart,i can't keep watching this dreck.
1244,Bart,did not.
9437,Bart,poor krusty. he's become the lowest form of life -- a sidekick.
9439,Bart,hell no.
1249,Bart,nothing you say can upset us. we're the mtv generation.
9444,Bart,krusty?
9446,Bart,what are you talking about? whose name is on that sign?
1255,Bart,"sorry, mom, the mob has spoken."
9449,Bart,that's it -- game over.
1272,Bart,which old witch?
9469,Bart,"look man, you've got to enjoy yourself a little. you work hard, or at least you're out of the house a lot."
9472,Bart,i have to go to the bathroom!
9473,Bart,no way! i wanna go a million more times!
9478,Bart,"oh great, now that dad's gonna star in it."
1291,Bart,"mitch, you're doing a bang-up job."
9486,Bart,homer! i need you to rickshaw me to soccer practice!
1297,Bart,that could be dad... station wagon... luggage rack...
9494,Bart,"yeah, like the time you said dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar, when he was really stuck in a barrel at the junkyard?"
1303,Bart,yo!
1310,Bart,father-son picnic.
1311,Bart,yeah. great.
1312,Bart,well... i've been thinking. you've been really great to me... but there's probably some other kid who needs you even more.
9502,Bart,"i said, all of them."
9503,Bart,and now just put your pearls back on and we'll go get some coffee.
9508,Bart,explosives? great!
1319,Bart,"hey, homer, have you seen my skateboard?"
1320,Bart,who the hell is pepi?
1321,Bart,who needs you? tom's a better father than you ever were.
1322,Bart,i was faking it.
9514,Bart,we ran a subway station?
1324,Bart,"this is all my fault, dad. i didn't want you to get hurt."
9518,Bart,sixth-graders! nooooooo!
1329,Bart,yeah.
9522,Bart,good guy...
9529,Bart,i've gotta get that letter before mom and dad do. stay focused...
1338,Bart,that's funny for so many reasons. we have to go to that show.
1341,Bart,i'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
1342,Bart,i'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
1343,Bart,you don't want to know how far i'll go.
9534,Bart,"wow, how does this show stay so fresh?"
9536,Bart,hey lis. mom and dad just told me two different things. how is that possible?
1347,Bart,i am not a butt.
1348,Bart,i'll be good.
1350,Bart,"you're next, chester a. arthur!"
1351,Bart,"unhand me, yankee."
9545,Bart,"hey, at least i'm on a path."
1355,Bart,i thought i'd investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs.
1356,Bart,"soitenly. nyuck, nyuck, nyuck."
1357,Bart,help me! help me!
9549,Bart,"whoa, what is this place?"
9553,Bart,you don't even want to know if i have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late?
1372,Bart,that is one evil dude.
9572,Bart,they look like this!
1382,Bart,beer! beer is the cheese. but how to use it...
9575,Bart,"oh look at you, opening a book so you won't have to talk to me. well i'm just gonna be tuning up the old armpit."
1385,Bart,april f...
9579,Bart,can i draw a robot barfing screws on your arm with my sharpie?
1393,Bart,shop around. you can't beat that price.
9589,Bart,it's not my fault -- grampa told me to kiss her!
1398,Bart,and sometimes i got into trouble...
9591,Bart,that's no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great.
9592,Bart,"well, i mean it."
9597,Bart,huh?
1407,Bart,what are you gonna change your name to when you grow up?
9599,Bart,you are the biggest psycho i ever met.

9609,Bart,i love youuuuuu!
1422,Bart,"well, how about grampa? he's pretty out of it. he let those guys use his check book for a whole year."
9616,Bart,"sad. maybe, if you were brad pitt."
9617,Bart,"reading prayers and ignoring them, just like god."
1427,Bart,"dad, can we talk to grampa alone for a minute?"
9620,Bart,"hey, why am i running from a girl?"
1433,Bart,"hey, what do you think he meant by that fools remark?"
1435,Bart,ow!
1439,Bart,"look, dad. i don't need school. i'll make my way as a bootblack. shine yer boots guv'nor?"
9633,Bart,where are you going?
1443,Bart,i guess that's it. i just can't be educated. i can always get a job testing dangerous food additives.
1448,Bart,i didn't do it.
9641,Bart,"oh lisa, you take the fun out of everything! i am so glad i am not your kid."
9643,Bart,oh no. you are not taking the children.
9645,Bart,aw...

9666,Bart,what? no! not until you raise my allowance.
1476,Bart,no problemo. we'll just sweep it all under the rug.
9673,Bart,look at the cool stuff that washed up!
1482,Bart,somebody ought to ruin gabbo's career the way he ruined krusty's.
1484,Bart,yes they do.
9678,Bart,ay carumba.
9681,Bart,"wake up, lis!"
1495,Bart,of course.
1497,Bart,"smart bunnies, hef. i can call you hef, can't i?"
1498,Bart,"hey, red hot chili peppers. would you guys like to appear on a krusty the klown special?"
9693,Bart,"hey homer, what do you think mom meant by ""taking care of something?"""
9698,Bart,"one, please."
1508,Bart,"dad, thanks to television, i can't remember what happened eight minutes ago."
1515,Bart,what?
1516,Bart,what'd you do... screw up like the beatles and say you were bigger than jesus?
9710,Bart,i'll prove i'm not crazy. sideshow bob could never resist singing along to a gilbert and sullivan operetta.
1524,Bart,"but who'd want to hurt me? i'm this century's ""dennis the menace."""
9718,Bart,"all right, ""walt warren,"" let's see who you really are."
9723,Bart,who needs a knife this big?
9724,Bart,"boner. mom, i'm scared!"
1535,Bart,mom! dad!
9727,Bart,great day to be alive!
1539,Bart,nah.
1543,Bart,"i knew i had to buy some time. so, i asked him to sing the score from ""the hms pinafore."""
1545,Bart,college? barber or clown?
9737,Bart,are you here to teach me or to kill me?
1548,Bart,"well, pop, what are you gonna do?"
1549,Bart,"listen to yourself, man. you're hangin' with nerds."
9748,Bart,"huh? wait a minute, this doesn't look like oslo. where are the wood-stave churches? historic akershus fortress?"
1558,Bart,"yes'm. dad, i know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can."
9750,Bart,"let's see what we've got here. krusty drunk on ""the tonight show,"" krusty drunk on ""the today show,"" krusty confesses to self-mutilation on match game p.m., ""krusty trips the pope,"" ""krusty vomits in baby carriage"", ""krusty uses child as shield"", ""krusty celebrity poker freak-out"", ""krusty super bowl nip slip"" ah, here we are, ""krusty on ""the electric company."""
1560,Bart,"hey, apu, this bag of ice has a head in it."
9752,Bart,"three days later, south africa freed nelson mandela from prison."
9753,Bart,i thought we were going to breakfast.
9754,Bart,"yeah, so we've already heard stories from thousands of years ago, about stuff that didn't happen."
1564,Bart,"paintings. lifeless images rendered in colorful goop. but at night, they take on a life of their own."
9758,Bart,maybe she's one of those sexy school- supply company reps.
9759,Bart,what? why?
9761,Bart,can't play baseball... what am i gonna do?
1571,Bart,"well, there's nothing scarier than having to go to school. ugh."
1572,Bart,"krusty visits relatives in annapolis, maryland..."
1580,Bart,"no! no, it's true! there's a monster on the bus."
9772,Bart,"a little's not gonna be enough, honey pie."
1582,Bart,the gremlin's taking off the wheel! stop the bus or we're all gonna die!
9775,Bart,"this isn't the game i grew up with, the game played in the misty ballparks of enron field, or pac bell, then s.b.c., now a. t. and t. park. and from now on, i'm gonna play my game."
9777,Bart,i wish you were a statistical illusion.
1594,Bart,"i know i really shouldn't, but when am i going to be here again?"
1595,Bart,whee!
1598,Bart,"lisa, it's not like you have a choice here."
1599,Bart,we're all vampires.
9792,Bart,"and according to my gut, you're okay too."
1607,Bart,"eh, shut your yap."
9800,Bart,yahtzu?
1609,Bart,"you're a good dog, arencha, boy? arencha?"
9804,Bart,one...

9811,Bart,"the final challenge! mousecatch... a game so lame, no one's ever finished it!"
1620,Bart,"uh-oh. you're in for it now, dad."
1622,Bart,a human going!
9814,Bart,there comes a time to beat the crap out of childish things!
1625,Bart,earth to boring guy.
9821,Bart,where the hell are we? i've never seen stores like these before.
9822,Bart,"well, stop in and say ""hi"" to me 'cause i'll still be there -- chillin' in my basement bachelor pad."

9826,Bart,i just wanna sit in the car!
9827,Bart,comin' through!

1648,Bart,wowww... that's good squishee.
1649,Bart,"ok... we're young, rich and full of sugar. what do we do?"

9847,Bart,uh... you do a lot with a limited wardrobe!
1659,Bart,"oh no. woe is me, my precious uniform."
9853,Bart,my poop stick has brought him back to life! but which end?
1666,Bart,you guys get to play with knives?
9858,Bart,what am i gonna do with you?
9862,Bart,come back! i'm not finished giving you your bath!
1671,Bart,don't do what donny don't does. they could've made this clearer.

9878,Bart,"wow, ray, you have hidden talents!"
1690,Bart,"you did it, dad! you saved us! i'm proud you're my father."
1700,Bart,yes!
9893,Bart,what about all the other pets you told us went to a farm upstate?
1706,Bart,"ah yeah, welcome... have a lucky day... um hmmm."
1708,Bart,"pipe down, sister. i've gotta book a new act for tonight. turns out that liza minelli impersonator was really liza minelli."

10037,Bart,i don't think i want to.
10039,Bart,"all right, i know there's a camera in you somewhere."
1852,Bart,he's gone forever.
1853,Bart,stampy!

1876,Bart,"anything, huh? okay... i want pizza, and i want it delivered by krusty the clown."
10068,Bart,this is it... i finally get to accept an award for my movie...except it's not just my movie. it was my sister's idea to make this into a short. and so many animators... every day was somebody's birthday. and you know what? it was my dad's movie too. i only wish he were here and not at cerritos auto square.
1880,Bart,mr. burns throws peas at smithers.
1881,Bart,"oh yuck, meatloaf! my most hated of all loafs."
1882,Bart,no! this family stinks. mr. burns nurtures my destructive side. i'm suffocating here.
10072,Bart,better -- the prospectors left naughty french postcards!
1884,Bart,i want to stay here with mr. burns.
1885,Bart,beats me. but it won't be back for three hours and forty minutes. once it had snow on it.
10079,Bart,cool! are they robots?
10082,Bart,i've got something you can stuff in that old bag.
10083,Bart,i've got some stuff to put a smile on that corpse.
10084,Bart,don't player hate. i'm just a businessboy.
1903,Bart,"not likely. c'mon, have a sense of humor about yourself!"
1905,Bart,"mom, you're always trying to give me potatoes. what is it with you?"
10097,Bart,cut it out!
1910,Bart,"my dog's name is santa's little helper. one time he crawled under the house, and when he came out he was covered with ants. then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water."
10103,Bart,good for you. no more drinkin'?
1917,Bart,"well, it was good to see you."
1918,Bart,"uh, no."
1919,Bart,"uh, i'm kinda busy on saturday."
1920,Bart,"uh, no i'll pass. hey, what's this?"
10109,Bart,fill the board then wash my car.
10110,Bart,what was that?
10113,Bart,"what're you gonna do, write a book about me?"
10115,Bart,"one, two, three, cry! one, two, three, cry!"
10117,Bart,"precious, is that you?"
1928,Bart,"oh, i think i can get him fired. i got you fired, didn't i?"
10122,Bart,i don't see many more movie roles for a girl like you! not unless george lucas needs another death star!
1932,Bart,"here's the plan. once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten, he'll fire ned on the spot."
10126,Bart,two to the left.
1935,Bart,so i guess we're enemies again.
10131,Bart,can't look. texting.
10133,Bart,"thanks, dad."
10134,Bart,"y'know, i was skeptical, but i guess therapy works."
10143,Bart,lisa can't be a magician -- that's my thing! i'm the one that got a magic set for christmas two years ago.
1953,Bart,"hey mcbain, i'm a big fan, but your last movie really sucked."
1955,Bart,"ah, that's gotta hoit!"
10147,Bart,tell me if she falls.
1957,Bart,"oh, yeah. right."
1958,Bart,"well they didn't, okay? they didn't! it says right here in black and white, no witnesses. case closed. now let's all read the funnies."
10150,Bart,all that's left is banana runts! that's the worst runt!
10154,Bart,hey -- you licked the back! that was my side!
1966,Bart,"what? uh, um, yeah. uh, i just want to say how great it is to finally see some chicks on the bench."
10158,Bart,you're lookin' at him.
1968,Bart,"sell it to hallmark, sis. you're lookin' at cucumber boy. as in ""cool as a."""
1969,Bart,"mom, what if there's a really bad, crummy guy who's going to jail, but i know he's innocent?"
1971,Bart,what if i can get this guy off the hook. sh-should i do it?
10171,Bart,really? why?
10173,Bart,but i worked so hard! i've got dirt under my fingernails i'll never get out. not that i'm gonna try.
1983,Bart,"ah, yes, my name is homer simpson, and i'd like to order an itchy an scratchy cel. my credit card? ah, do you accept the federal breast inspector's card? license to ogle? viza?... oh yes, of course, that's what i meant, visa. it's these new dentures."
1985,Bart,that's me.
10180,Bart,not to worry.
1994,Bart,"hi. you know, gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me. she especially likes it when they give me money."
1995,Bart,"very well, you leave me no choice."
1996,Bart,this gun is filled with ketchup. this one with mustard. now give me three hundred fifty bucks or you're gonna be a mess for your date.
10190,Bart,i hear he goes to california on his vacations.
10191,Bart,"once you get past the sister ick, they're fine."
2000,Bart,"oh well, he's happy. i'm gonna keep this mary worth phone right here. her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again."
10195,Bart,are you nuts?! let's have some fun!
2005,Bart,what the hell are you talkin' about? you're the one who double dared us.
10197,Bart,let's start with a little federal crime.
2007,Bart,"wow, i've never seen mom so mad at homer before."
2008,Bart,"earth base, this is commander bart mccool. we are under attack by the zorrinid brain changers! quickly, into the safety dome, milbot!"
2010,Bart,"oh, sorry. here's a fresh one."
2013,Bart,"so long, lis. i'm gonna stow away underwater, and go where the pool goes. have a good life."
2014,Bart,"oh well. same time tomorrow, otto?"

2020,Bart,i'm gonna miss the whole summer.
2021,Bart,"hey, guys! sign my cast? sign my cast? guys...?"
2026,Bart,"what fun can you have in a pool, anyway, that you can't have in a bathtub with a garbage bag taped around your cast?"
10218,Bart,meet me in the bathroom.
2028,Bart,"you know, this isn't so bad. i'll just spend the summer getting better acquainted with an old friend called television."
2033,Bart,"uh, no."
2035,Bart,there was an optics festival and i wasn't informed? you go now.
10228,Bart,mrs. k.? are you still bumping moustaches with ned?
2041,Bart,can't be what it looks like. this is flanders we're talkin' about.
2043,Bart,"uh, uh, noo. this can't be what it looks like. there's gotta be some other explanation."
2052,Bart,"of course. oh no. he's back. flanders is back! lisa, get outta there!"
2053,Bart,"no, lisa, don't go upstairs. you'll be trapped!"
10244,Bart,if i told you i'd have to kill you. can i tell ya?
10245,Bart,for this masterpiece i bid...one thousand dollars!
10255,Bart,"man, teddy roosevelt killed more spaniards in one day than most people do in their whole lives!"
10257,Bart,"well, i've learned a lot today. now to go home and let tv slowly rot it all away."
10261,Bart,wow. and here i thought god created all this. thanks for setting me straight.
2070,Bart,"homer, that was downright decent of you."
10264,Bart,"just quoting our twenty-sixth president, lis. you could use a little t.r. in your life."
2073,Bart,"i can't stand to see you so miserable, lis, unless it's from a rubber spider down your dress. hmmm. that gives me an idea."
10265,Bart,balderdash! teddy roosevelt protected america's wildlife!
10266,Bart,face on a mountain!
10269,Bart,chalmers would actually take us out to see the rocks.
10270,Bart,my book is missing page thirty-two.
10271,Bart,my desktop is sticky with soda from the kid that had it before me.
10275,Bart,i'm thinking of something big. so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back!
10277,Bart,there's a car with its lights on in the teacher's lot.
2091,Bart,right on!
10287,Bart,thanks. but these rough riders aren't dismounting until you get your job back.
2096,Bart,"no need, mom. we already learned in school."
2097,Bart,bo-ring.
10288,Bart,"oh my god. milhouse, did you take your nap?"
10290,Bart,"sir, of all the books and movies about teddy roosevelt, which would you say is the most informative?"
2101,Bart,what happened to mindy?
10293,Bart,he opened his eyes! mommm!
2103,Bart,"a-a-a-a-and, now."
2104,Bart,"yes, i do. the only girl i ever loved invited me up to the treehouse. she had something very important to tell me."
2105,Bart,"wait, that did end in heartbreak. thanks for opening up old wounds, you ma."
2107,Bart,"but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half. can we go, dad? can we can we can we, take it, lis."
2110,Bart,"don't worry, mom. we'll make you proud of us."
2111,Bart,agreed.
10304,Bart,"no, the science fair's not till next week!"
2114,Bart,"do it, dad."
2116,Bart,ow!
10309,Bart,not really -- i was trying to bounce it off your left testie.
10311,Bart,"to sweeten the deal, i'll pick you first for basketball."
2123,Bart,"i don't know, disgruntled goat had his moments."
2126,Bart,can you believe i keep gettin' away with this... officer?
2128,Bart,"yeah. there's just no way to resist it, is there?"
10320,Bart,oh... um...
10323,Bart,vip passes!
10328,Bart,"well when you meet them, tell them your game's too easy."
2137,Bart,"you think you're so big 'cause your class always gets to do projects. well, um... i'm doing a school project on, uh, fireworks!"
2139,Bart,eep.
10332,Bart,"that isn't an ""x,"" mom."
2141,Bart,"hey, four-eyes! vote quimby! hey, beard-o! vote quimby!"
2142,Bart,don't worry. he's taken a million of these capsules.
10335,Bart,we're not a gang! gangs are cool!
2144,Bart,you mean i have to repeat the fourth grade?
10339,Bart,so grab a pancake and slurp some slop!
10341,Bart,"aw, come on, dad, be a foodie! you're already a fatty and a drunkie!"
2153,Bart,lis! lis! c'mere! i found him! i found edgar neubauer!
2157,Bart,sonny to his cher!
10349,Bart,we ate mad-scientist food and broke up a meth lab in the same day!
2159,Bart,aww. tomorrow we were gonna find out who the dish ran away with.
10354,Bart,choke on fossil poop!
2163,Bart,"don't worry, mom. i can use my ""shinning"" to call willie."
10356,Bart,i like the beat -- play me the tune.
10357,Bart,"chapter-book crowd? that's a juicy peach, but what's the cream?"
10366,Bart,"like no one ever writes for money, lisa. i don't see your boyfriend william shakespeare missing too many meals."
2175,Bart,"nevertheless, i remain confident that something will come along and save the two simpson children."
10370,Bart,"okay, gaiman, you're in. your job is to get lunch. and lose the british accent."
2180,Bart,"why the crap do we have to go to church, anyway?"
10373,Bart,"hope you don't mind us printing our book in your room, lis."
10374,Bart,correction: finished manuscript.
2183,Bart,i've never felt this way about a girl before. my long search is finally over.
10375,Bart,fake author?
2185,Bart,"is it my hair? my overbite? the fact that i've worn the same clothes, day in, day out, for the last four years?"
10384,Bart,kansas city.
2196,Bart,"really? uh, sure."
2198,Bart,"well, in my family, grades aren't that important. it's what you learn that counts."
2200,Bart,"well no offense, lady, but what you don't know could fill a warehouse."
2201,Bart,"sorry, i have kind of a short fuse, which some find charming. speaking of charming, watching fox last night, i heard a rather amusing story... this character named martin was feeling rather randy and he was heard to remark..."
10393,Bart,i'll read! i'll read!
2204,Bart,"i'm bad to the bone, honey."
10396,Bart,...is eternal pati... pat-eh... pa-tie...
2206,Bart,"smart, beautiful, and a liar! so much better than that sarah, plain and tall."
10398,Bart,"i don't want your help! i'll get one of those jobs where you don't need to read, like french fry maker or general."
10401,Bart,"""but when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then jo found her promise very hard to keep."""
2210,Bart,jessica we just...
2211,Bart,why?
10408,Bart,what a rip.
2217,Bart,"actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity, i just might be able to hold on."
2220,Bart,nooooo!
2223,Bart,"she's like a milk dud, lis. sweet on the outside, poison on the inside."
10417,Bart,"krusty, you're getting the best reviews of your career!"
2226,Bart,"there. if i can just get through this many days without seeing her, she should be completely out of my system. okay, day one."
10418,Bart,"krusty, my man, you finally hit it big."
2228,Bart,"oh lis, she's already drawing me to her with her beautiful siren song."
2231,Bart,"jessica, what are you doing!"
10423,Bart,why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding?
2233,Bart,i...
2238,Bart,that doesn't make any sense.
10430,Bart,"from now on when someone asks me, i'm gonna say you are my father."
2245,Bart,"hi, jessica."
10437,Bart,we totally wasted his time.
2247,Bart,"well, don't you see, jessica, then you really haven't learned --"
10441,Bart,jimbo heard me say it. i'm dead.
2254,Bart,unseasonable warmth...?
10448,Bart,what gives? he's not crawlin' back.
10449,Bart,milhouse!
2260,Bart,...dad.
2261,Bart,"aw thanks, dad."
2264,Bart,because - you - stink - at - sports...
10458,Bart,"milhouse, you're the closest thing i have to a brother. a brother with the wisdom of an older sister. and that's why we squabble, 'cause families always do. but in the end, they're still a family. what do you say... brother?"
2267,Bart,sorry.
10462,Bart,milhouse.
10463,Bart,"i've been out here all night, man. just let me know what it'll take for you to forgive me."
10465,Bart,"sure, what've you got? puppy goo-goo comin' my way?"
2275,Bart,"i know you are, but what am i?"
10469,Bart,maybe we should just watch tv.
2279,Bart,"uh uh, lisa started it."
2281,Bart,"good luck tonight, sis. i'll try not to hurt you."
2288,Bart,mom! how can you leave us with this maniac?!
2290,Bart,"disemboweler 4, the game where condemned criminals dig at each other with rusty hooks."
2291,Bart,no waaaay. gg-aah... yes'm.
2292,Bart,ow.
2293,Bart,"hey lis, i found a big caramel deposit at the small of her back!"
2294,Bart,why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt? that's where cooties come from.
10484,Bart,prepare to be disappointed!
2296,Bart,"and the dog in the coppertone ad? same deal, dad?"
10491,Bart,i just got started!
2300,Bart,mom!! dad!!
2301,Bart,there's a u.f.o. outside my window!! seriously!
2302,Bart,c-c-can i sleep in there with you guys tonight?
10494,Bart,well how are we supposed to get fuel?
10495,Bart,"how're you doin', mr. assange?"
10497,Bart,you sure this is a good idea?
10498,Bart,i'm on it.
2307,Bart,i'unno.
10499,Bart,lenny lenford. you're a long way from your barstool.
2309,Bart,"scary, no? and this guy's head of the spaceology department at the correspondence college of tampa!"
10500,Bart,"come on, man, we wouldn't leave you behind."
2311,Bart,so what's the simplest explanation?
10503,Bart,"open mine! quick, before it suffocates!"
10504,Bart,check it out! it's on tv!
2314,Bart,"dad, number one: i know how to ride a bike. number two: i already own a bike. and number three: that is a girl's bike."
2321,Bart,"oh, great. i specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby."
2337,Bart,wow. two.
10532,Bart,help! helllp!
10533,Bart,"oh, this is just a dream. all i have to do is wake up."
10540,Bart,"art lovers and bart lovers! first of all, i'd like to thank the good folks at springfield arts daily for setting this up."
10545,Bart,i need to go to the bathroom.
10547,Bart,"i can't believe you got all your friends in trouble, and you got the day off!"
10555,Bart,"man, homer, you've always been a loser."
2369,Bart,there it is right there.
2370,Bart,but you don't need a stupid telescope. it's right there.
10564,Bart,that movie's for babies.
10566,Bart,get that stuff off!
2376,Bart,we're doomed!
2377,Bart,"wow, dad. maybe you're right."
10570,Bart,"oh, that is cool. looks like two snakes trying to kill each other on your head."
2379,Bart,cool!
2382,Bart,i don't think any of us expected him to say that.
10578,Bart,mi-mi-mi-mi-mi...
10580,Bart,don't worry. i made sure he can't get too far.
10581,Bart,"hey, the first time we lost maggie was in this store."
10590,Bart,i'm on the grass apron!
10592,Bart,"oh, it's you."
10594,Bart,"all right. follow me, to a place where nerds, dorks and dweebs can gather in safety."
10600,Bart,"well, that is one lucky creepy guy."
10601,Bart,"it's okay, dad. he's just putting the fear of god in me."
2412,Bart,"this is bart simpson. can i help you, ma'am?"
2415,Bart,mr. simpson... blah blah... misrepresentation over telephone... yadda yadda... sincerely... some australian jerk.
10609,Bart,"i sold all my stuff, and it's still not enough money for the cruise."
2420,Bart,i'm sorry.
2425,Bart,"i'm way ahead of ya, dad."
10618,Bart,what?!
10619,Bart,i can offer you a cabin on our sugar-free fitness cruise...
10622,Bart,i knew it. it was all a dream.
2431,Bart,yuh-oh.
2435,Bart,"no, mom... wait. it's time for me to bend over and receive my destiny."
10631,Bart,they're buyin' it. they're buyin' it!
10635,Bart,what a load of crap!
2445,Bart,oh no. it's p.e. sign up day!
10638,Bart,can't anybody enjoy their forever vacation!?
10641,Bart,uhhhhh... gotta go!
2450,Bart,"i don't like wearing tights, ma'am."
2456,Bart,pretty big crowd.
10649,Bart,"they spend all their time trying to raise a baby, and why? so it can grow up and do the same dumb thing on and on forever!"
2461,Bart,uh-oh.
10654,Bart,"nelson, i could give you my lunch money... or, i could give you..."
10657,Bart,"no, you're imagining things."
2468,Bart,this is the last time i use a plan devised by milhouse.
2471,Bart,"hey man, i really love your show. i think all kids should watch it. i suddenly feel so dirty."
10663,Bart,"yeah, why aren't we doing lenny's story? that thing's hilarious."
2473,Bart,you made a movie?
10665,Bart,"yo, homer! mom says get your fat ass over to the flanders'!"
2476,Bart,meh.
2477,Bart,"hi, mom. aw, that's great news about lisa. well listen, i'd better get to get back to work."
2478,Bart,"heh, heh. they're finally paying me for this."
10669,Bart,want my advice on dealing with the hardly boys?
2480,Bart,here they come! raise the flag!
10681,Bart,"""lisa doesn't judge other people. why should we judge her?"" it's signed, ""truth teller."""
10683,Bart,and read books where the parents are divorced. that joint is jumpin'.
2492,Bart,"it looks like he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite make it. come on, boy, you can do it!"
2494,Bart,"me and santa's little helper used to be a team, but he never wants to play anymore since his bitch moved in!"
2496,Bart,hey look! a really small dog just fell out of santa's girlfriend.
10689,Bart,i hear tapping from inside.
10690,Bart,"so, is this a date date, or just a meaningless friend thing?"
10693,Bart,"dance with me, please. i need to zing my sister."
2503,Bart,"say, jimbo ... hope i wasn't out of line with that ""jerkface"" crack."
10698,Bart,"oh man, lisa's right -- none of these relationships lasted very long. three days, one recess, half a field trip... why did i have to get so needy at the planetarium?"
2507,Bart,we don't have to wait for the cops - who can track the puppies better than their own mom and dad?
2508,Bart,sorry. you've gotta admit it's catchy.
2509,Bart,we've gotta get the dogs outta there!
10702,Bart,i can't believe she ran away. and this isn't helping.
10703,Bart,i'd better switch to the hard stuff.
2515,Bart,"okay guys, let's move!"
10710,Bart,dadgummit! do you think she still likes me?
10716,Bart,we're safe because you have to climb steps to get up here.
2525,Bart,i saw you two fighting. i'm worried there could be a strike and the school would shut down.
10718,Bart,"come on, let's go find mary! this is the address her brother gave me."
10722,Bart,"girls don't like me. i don't really like them yet either, but i think i'm gonna. there's a storm a-brewin' down there."
2535,Bart,"now you, dump three tons of sand onto that port-a-potty."
2543,Bart,"hello, mother dear."
2547,Bart,horrifying.
10743,Bart,that's impossible!
2555,Bart,"zuh? wait, that's it! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts, we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together."
2556,Bart,...and you're not coming out until you reach an agreement.
10749,Bart,"hey, homer."
2562,Bart,"um, the guy who chopped up george washington?"
10755,Bart,"now to return to a future where i'm either rich or allowed to stand in front of a rich guy's house. either way, better than now."
2567,Bart,no teacher shall be held accountable if bart simpson dies.
2569,Bart,"look, my stomach really hurts."
10761,Bart,oh no! lisa's face... it's the same!
10765,Bart,"that guy has a bone to pick with the board of regents. hey, lisa's not getting on the bus."
10768,Bart,the five boxing wizards jump quickly? whoa! my sister's finally become... mildly interesting!
2577,Bart,five hundred dollars!
2579,Bart,i can't believe it! five hundred bucks! just think what i can do with that money!
10772,Bart,lowering your blinds. i'd hate for your carpet to fade.
2581,Bart,cool.
2584,Bart,"lisa, look what i've got!"
10780,Bart,i'm only down sixty-two dollars. not counting my tips to the waitresses.
2589,Bart,"yeah, like that really hurt."
10783,Bart,"aw, c'mon, lis. no gambling story has a happy ending, except seabiscuit. but you never hear about the ruined lives of the people who bet against him."
2595,Bart,tv with a picture of the mayor on it?
2598,Bart,"wet cement! is there any sweeter sign? well, maybe ""high voltage."""
2599,Bart,no time.
10790,Bart,because i actually like you and felt sorry for you.
2601,Bart,ay caramba!
2602,Bart,"aah. oh, good, somebody's shadow. i'll just turn and brag about my work."
2604,Bart,i think he'd be cool with it.
2605,Bart,"mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring springfield."
10797,Bart,"eh, free is free."

10814,Bart,"yeah it was great! this one guy was part of another guy's gang, i mean ""kkangpae,"" but then he quit and joined another kkangpae, and when the guys in the first kkangpae found out, they were so mad they put his feet in a blender. then they cut to a guy eating noodles and blood splashed on him!"
10817,Bart,no one bad-mouths my dad except me!
2629,Bart,they're gettin' rich off us!
2633,Bart,"aw. it's no use, milhouse. if we're gonna find that lemon tree, i've got to go undercover. what i need is a new face."
2638,Bart,"no, not in my mouth! aye--is what the kid would say. to the bluffs!"
2646,Bart,caution: exit through door seven only. all other rooms contain man-eating tigers.
10840,Bart,"c'mon, boy. time to go to bed."
10844,Bart,you'd have to wrap cheese around it.
2654,Bart,the tree!
2655,Bart,"keep your voices down, boys. we didn't come this far to get found out."
2656,Bart,but they stole our lemon tree!
2657,Bart,"there's got to be a way to get that tree back. hey, look. a hospital! pull in there."
10850,Bart,"aren't they just saying ""refrigerator?"""

10952,Bart,twenty-four hours? where'd you pull that crazy number?
2763,Bart,geez. you're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day.
10955,Bart,"don't worry, all i need is a cigarette lighter and some sandpaper."
2769,Bart,nope. i don't feel a thing.
10964,Bart,"okay, first, tone it down. time to teach you to be a man."
10967,Bart,"now, did you get kirk's license?"
10978,Bart,that's all you pay for screwing up a child for life?
10979,Bart,"lady, my stomach's full and i wanna go. that's how it works in this country."
10982,Bart,you sure you're not just doing all this because it's cool to be accepting of a gay family member?
10989,Bart,you settled that swede's meatballs!
10990,Bart,"i can't wait to see grampa kick some ass! he's always pretended to be boring, but he's really a straight-up psycho!"
2799,Bart,"i think lisa's right, dad. eating meat is ba-a-a-ad."
11001,Bart,you all stink!
11002,Bart,what are you doing?
2818,Bart,"...and then he raked me across the chest. and the weirdest thing was, it was that school janitor who mysteriously disappeared -- groundskeeper willie."
11010,Bart,"easy, easy. let's not jump to conclu--"
11012,Bart,"i know this looks bad. and i admit, i would totally lie in a second to lisa or mom or dad. but i would never lie to maggie."
11015,Bart,"yeah, why would you play chess through the mail when you can play chess through the internet, or preferably, not play chess at all?"
11016,Bart,it's not a threat if i don't know what it means.
11018,Bart,"this case is goin' great. although as usual, i look nothing like the courtroom artist's drawing."
11019,Bart,"nice try, pop."
11020,Bart,"pass the gravy, gloria allwrong."
2831,Bart,no.
11024,Bart,"oh, i'm sorry, that means i threw yours out. but i still have a couple of your mini carrots."
2833,Bart,"cool, man!"
2838,Bart,"dad, i know we don't do a lot together, but helping you gain 61 pounds is something i want to be a part of."
2845,Bart,"dad? it says ""non-toxic."""
2847,Bart,"not me, sister. when i grow up i wanna be a lardo on workman's comp, just like dad."

11075,Bart,"grampa, i made your favorite dinner -- teething biscuits soaked in buttermilk."
11076,Bart,"you're completely fine! i've been taking care of you, giving you love and attention... for nothing!"
11077,Bart,but mom said it was a gift made with love.
11078,Bart,no. even she thought it was crap.
2890,Bart,there's no perfect crime.

5567,Bart,"so when i took the test, the answers were stuck in my brain. it was like a whole different kind of cheating."
5570,Bart,christmas.

5617,Bart,"okay, i'm sold."
5626,Bart,"please, fbi man, don't throw us in jail. we just made one mistake."

5721,Bart,"oh, look, you're gettin' cranky. you haven't had your juice."
5722,Bart,"it's a vacuum cleaner, milhouse."

5856,Bart,is it a dead body?
5858,Bart,"let's see, front door, back door, skinner's, flanders', your house... ah, lisa's bike."

6837,Bart,"lis, your stupid present will only last a week. mine will sit in a closet for years."
6839,Bart,wow! it's a machine that makes carnival food at home.
6846,Bart,why don't you take a bath in the river? this bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago.
6859,Bart,"cheer up, krusty. you're a clue in the people magazine crossword puzzle. what more can a man want?"
6865,Bart,"dad, you blew it. you listened to lisa. and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience."

6937,Bart,that is so cool!
6942,Bart,"well, you did disappear a lot, but i have gone whole summers without seeing you."
6951,Bart,oh yeah. how does that go again?
6953,Bart,oh c'mon. can't we at least have one pity scalp?
6962,Bart,you mean up until now you did care? then why did you wear that tutu to school last week?
6974,Bart,i never thought i'd have to take a plane to see milhouse.
6975,Bart,milhouse? is that you?
6989,Bart,"or like when i discovered the school's xerox code. one, four, seven. just sayin' it makes my butt feel warm again."
6992,Bart,"okay, shake."
6994,Bart,that's what you call commitment to a bit.
7004,Bart,"since he's been back, milhouse has had three bloody noses and stepped in dog doo. it's always a party with that guy."
7008,Bart,"hey lis, you wanna play cap city monopoly?"
7009,Bart,"oh c'mon, i'll roll the dice for you."

7223,Bart,that's congresswoman bella abzug.
7226,Bart,what's the first thing you're gonna make in your new kitchen?
7227,Bart,"well, the playdude advisor says this music will get a stewardess to give you a layover."
7229,Bart,"it's dessert, but it's hot dogs, so it's good for you!"
7234,Bart,"hey, it wouldn't be a playdude party without james caan."
7238,Bart,uh... toys?

7257,Bart,my mother... my bully... my god!
7259,Bart,but it's a single bed.
7260,Bart,"mom, the reason god invented deadbolts is to keep people like nelson out of your house."
7266,Bart,"so, now that you're happy again, i guess you won't beat me up at school anymore."
7273,Bart,thanks for cushioning my fall.

7653,Bart,we tried to break up your parents and we broke up mine!
7657,Bart,"oh come on, wouldn't it be easier if our parents divorced and you compensated by marrying much older men? meanwhile, i'll be one of those weird guys who's thirty-five and shows up at high school basketball games."

7750,Bart,"hey mom, can i have some money to buy dad a present?"
7753,Bart,"that's what i'm gettin', how 'bout you?"
7754,Bart,ay carumba.
7760,Bart,"ralph, there's a hole in your basket."
7764,Bart,"hey cryptkeeper, i like your dodge scare-a-van."
7769,Bart,"sideshow bob! of all the regioni and all the villaggi in all of italia, you had to be il mayore of this one."
7787,Bart,"dad, you've been in a coma for three days."
7788,Bart,"what can i say? i missed you, myra."
7796,Bart,"oh, my god! my dad had a long talk with me about this, but you can't believe it till you see it!"
7798,Bart,"hey, we can't leave here without turning one little valve."
7799,Bart,can i cut a deal? i'll give you milhouse.
7801,Bart,"dad, if you take me to vegas, i'll teach you how to cheat at blackjack."
7814,Bart,"hm, if i save you, what are you gonna do to me?"
7818,Bart,dad?
7824,Bart,bombardment. bombardment. how do you like bombardment? i'll show him.
7830,Bart,"listen, i'm real sorry i busted your shack. let me make it up to you. i know a ravine where there's a rusted-out car."
7831,Bart,"that's my mom, i gotta go. i finished nailing this board."
7832,Bart,"oh yeah, you're out of nails."
7833,Bart,maybe you could aim a little higher.
7842,Bart,"but on the upside, i found some cave paintings and made them awesome."
7851,Bart,and... joust!
7852,Bart,let's do it again!
7861,Bart,toot-toot! look! i'm using this rock as a tool!
7863,Bart,"okay, but don't let our hands touch. it's gay."
7868,Bart,"help me, cameraman! i let you smoke a cigarette in my bedroom."
7886,Bart,hey!
7892,Bart,"oh, there it is."
7893,Bart,you?
7895,Bart,"don't worry, mom. they all passed by."
7896,Bart,woo hoo! i'm drenched in blood!
7898,Bart,"it is gonna be awesome! now i can walk down the hall with ""bart junior"" hangin' out. isn't that right, bart junior?"
7901,Bart,you have toilet paper on your shoe.
7905,Bart,oh my god...
7917,Bart,"the only reason lisa won is because she learned to think like a boy! i turned her into a burping, farting, bullying, math machine!"
7924,Bart,oh it's great. like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.
7925,Bart,it hurts when i swallow.
7935,Bart,"sit on it, springfield! yeah!"
7941,Bart,i just had my first kiss.
7942,Bart,weaving?!
7953,Bart,"nah, i know enough."
7968,Bart,cool! who is it?
7971,Bart,it fell off a truck-truck truck.
7972,Bart,i don't know.
7974,Bart,"thanks, but i'm going into bootleg dvds."
7978,Bart,uh-oh.
7980,Bart,i thought you wanted me to drum!
7987,Bart,"it's mergatronic, daddy-ho."
8000,Bart,now i'm gonna learn a new word.
8005,Bart,"i wanna thank everyone for this special night. jazz folk may have the smallest apartments, but they also have the biggest hearts."
8006,Bart,but the biggest heart i know is in my sister lisa.
8007,Bart,"lis, you poured your heart into rescuing society's most vulnerable critters: animals. so i want all the money we've raised tonight to go to building... the lisa simpson home for abandoned animals!"
8008,Bart,"yeah, hasn't been the same since they murdered the mayor's dad here."
8009,Bart,"these games are so old. who got these high scores? pilgrims? hmm, never saw this one before."
8010,Bart,what's going on here? am i destroying these triangles or trying to assemble them? what does this button do? now my ship is pooping more triangles!
8011,Bart,"oh no, i won a free game!"
8019,Bart,"yes, you might say he'll ""blow up."""
8027,Bart,kids don't die!
8028,Bart,i was... el barto.
8038,Bart,it worked!
8041,Bart,that's better.
8044,Bart,"finally, someone who does whatever i say."
8045,Bart,get lost.
8046,Bart,"oh, it's always the jews' fault."
8054,Bart,what size do i smell like?
8055,Bart,re-lace them all!
8056,Bart,who are these wonderful people?
8060,Bart,"don't worry, dad. you'll do great."
8068,Bart,i only eat the clown heads.
8074,Bart,"man, mom and dad are really going at it."
8081,Bart,"mom, i can't go -- no one else is!"
8082,Bart,kind of?
8084,Bart,why?
8086,Bart,"this party doesn't suck. pizza, that's a nice touch."
8090,Bart,"well, that's the thing. sometimes, you can be kind of a jerk."
8096,Bart,"look, um, i don't have time for new friends. i got a lot on my plate. i've got a big report due on the nile river: topic sentence, bibliography, page numbers... it's nuts."
8100,Bart,a nelson vest!
8102,Bart,"all of a sudden, i was a somebody in a school full of nobodies. i could go anywhere, do anything. for us, to live any other way was nuts."
8121,Bart,there you go again -- you act all nice and then you go crazy.
8122,Bart,"um, nelson? was the water always up to our necks? nelson?!"
8123,Bart,help! help!
8124,Bart,where'd you get it?
8132,Bart,"i didn't think it would ever come, but it did!"
8133,Bart,do you really understand what that means?
8135,Bart,gil's gone.
8137,Bart,can we have pancakes for dinner?
8140,Bart,what about brazil?
8141,Bart,better than cod?
8155,Bart,that stunk worse than boiled cabbage.
8156,Bart,"i want to avenge you, but i don't know how."
8157,Bart,holy hannah! i've got more muscles than a new england clambake. now all i need is a superhero name.
8160,Bart,"so you see, revenge is great. and there's three ways to talk about it. although two of the ways were kind of the same way, and even the third one might have worked better as a halloween story..."
8162,Bart,"clean, dirty clean, dirty clean, dirty ..."
8165,Bart,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
8166,Bart,"my last words are ""lisa suuuucks""!"
8174,Bart,"oh, man! what now?"
8180,Bart,"man, this town's got everything!"
8181,Bart,any of you ladies like stereo music?
8191,Bart,how religious can you be if you're pregnant?
32768,Homer,uh... are you sure you want lisa to keep dancing?
32788,Homer,"dad, are you sure you're okay to drive at night?"
32789,Homer,"all right, that's it, pull over."
32792,Homer,"homer simpson. i know a lot of you from church, and the market and such. and i'm not much for talkin' -- but seems to me, in hard times like these that we americans come together."
32796,Homer,"don't worry, you can stay with us. i'm sure marge will be cool."
32802,Homer,"and he has hair! bart, get me my suicide axe."
32805,Homer,why you little--
32808,Homer,lurleen's daddy comes back after thirty years and he's father of the year. why can't i leave for thirty years?
32821,Homer,sold.
32827,Homer,have you got lou in your car?
32841,Homer,the food is all around us.
32846,Homer,"why, 'cause i'm fat?"
32848,Homer,uh-oh. there's already an on-set romance.
32849,Homer,"stupid charities, they think i'm gonna give them money? save the children? save your breath. take a hike, sierra club! doctors without borders? doctors without money! hey, greenpeace, you're not getting' a piece of my green! robert redford? guess what -- a scissor runs through it."
32853,Homer,who are you?
32854,Homer,what else?
32856,Homer,"hey, you're crying!"
32857,Homer,what?
32858,Homer,"we can't wait to see it, sweetie."
32859,Homer,a documentary?!
32866,Homer,no.
32874,Homer,"i don't want to get mad, but i will!"
32877,Homer,"don't worry -- i'm ready for this. bart, fetch ""the defender."""
32891,Homer,"oh, i don't even care."
32893,Homer,no! i can't forgive you -- and i don't accept your tuck-in!
32895,Homer,mom?
32898,Homer,mom!
32905,Homer,"apu, what do you think happens after you die?"
32909,Homer,woo hoo!
32915,Homer,"i'm really glad you corrected me, lisa. people are always really glad when they're corrected."
32918,Homer,"i always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me."
32921,Homer,that's the highest point. and only fifteen minutes to go.
32922,Homer,made it!
32923,Homer,"mom, we didn't know each other very well. if we did, you never would have asked me to climb anything. but even when you weren't around, i always felt good, knowing you were out there somewhere."
32936,Homer,toss it down!
32949,Homer,"son... all hobbies suck. but if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to kill some precious time."
32965,Homer,"you got it, boy."
32967,Homer,three-peat.
32970,Homer,what a great job. and i could use a job right now.
32976,Homer,"this case is ""in the bag."""
32980,Homer,he hands a greeting card to ned.
32984,Homer,"we should be bounty hunters together. you're kind and smart, i'm cruel and strong. together, we're nothing. but together, we're the perfect bounty hunter."
32992,Homer,daddy's home! i brought you kids some stuff from work!
32996,Homer,the biggest one in town.
33002,Homer,still on the fence.
33006,Homer,"well, i like a.c.-d.c."
33015,Homer,you know what your problem is? you haven't become as bad as the people we chase!
33022,Homer,hello! hello? anybody home? hello?
33029,Homer,"yeah, but you hold onto the big things! the point is, the more i got to know you, the more i got to like you."
33031,Homer,"i've got you, my friend."
33032,Homer,"well, i'm--"
33034,Homer,"aw, dammit!"
33036,Homer,"oh, baby."
33038,Homer,huh?
33040,Homer,did he take the bait?
33046,Homer,our little boy has lost his mind. let's get him.
33050,Homer,the computer says bart's standing on the computer. all i see is a stupid bird with a tracking chip on its leg! it doesn't add up!
33056,Homer,you just cost me two hundred thousand dollars!
33068,Homer,human garbage can to the rescue!
33088,Homer,were we ever that stupid?
33095,Homer,"then i now pronounce us ""just dating."""
33097,Homer,knock it off!
33098,Homer,how dare you expose my children to your tender feelings! bart! don't you dare take your eyes off that gameboy!
33099,Homer,videogames -- the reason this generation of americans is the best ever.
33101,Homer,that's it!
33102,Homer,"eat gravel, hags!"
33105,Homer,how many times do i have to say i'm sorry?
33116,Homer,she's not strange! she's fun! and she doesn't get jealous when i talk to other women!
33121,Homer,"kids, this place has very special memories for your mother and me."
33139,Homer,i feel the same way about that lamp.
33141,Homer,"listen, you're a classy lady and a great sushi fighter. but you're goin' in the box."
33152,Homer,forever? that would be awesome.
33157,Homer,so that wasn't marge's glider parked outside the motel five years ago! i'm getting out of this marriage while i'm still young and handsome.
33158,Homer,4 ever. i couldn't even keep a promise i made to a tree. maybe it's not too late! maybe i can still save our love. if i just show her that carving...
33165,Homer,now we wait for the river to freeze. if my theory of global cooling is correct.
33168,Homer,how about r?
33171,Homer,"six cups, please. and put it on my tab."
33179,Homer,yeah.
33182,Homer,"oh, i'm afraid lenny's dead."
33192,Homer,"marge, if i had a hundred dollars for every customer i'd broken up, i'd have exactly this amount. 'cause that's what i charge!"
33204,Homer,"she won! and like any prudent gambler, i know when to walk away: never!"
33212,Homer,"you know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental."
33213,Homer,no.
33218,Homer,"mr. teddy, can you ask lisa if she's mad? what's that, mr. teddy? you're saying that you know women? and that when women say they're not mad, they're madder than ever?"
33228,Homer,kitten calendar.
33230,Homer,"okay. what can i do for you? please, i'm begging you!"
33238,Homer,"oh, i can't believe that till i see a fictional tv program espousing your point of view."
33239,Homer,oh my god. what can i do?
33248,Homer,"shut up, old man."
33253,Homer,i am sorry i suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. i hope we can move past this and...
33254,Homer,dynamite?! they are terrorists! must leave quietly.
33256,Homer,marge! i was right! everybody is whatever i think they are.
33258,Homer,"all right, sweetie. but if i wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it."
33265,Homer,i want to apologize for being such a jerk at dinner. and i thought the best way to do that would be to come to your house and poke around.
33266,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait... i read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests. is that true?"
33276,Homer,"just lis-ten! i'm grinding them now! ow! my finger! ooh, here comes the ambulance! my, you're a handsome fellow. just get in the ambulance, mr. simpson. we'll see to your finger. why thank you."
33284,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
33296,Homer,"i never dreamed the future could be scary. let's go, lisa. we've got some worms to save!"
33300,Homer,there's one on lisa!
33304,Homer,"really? i thought it was lisa with a beard of bees. well whatever, brace yourself."
33308,Homer,i knew it!
33309,Homer,i'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.
33312,Homer,"oh yeah, yeah, that's what i meant too. i have no... inclination..."
33313,Homer,yep.
33321,Homer,"when you're older, you'll miss these fun activities."
33323,Homer,could've been. if we hadn't had kids.
33325,Homer,"friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening. also, if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it."
33329,Homer,we... i... you come up with an excuse!
33333,Homer,"hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?"
33340,Homer,wait!
33345,Homer,"okay, chapter one... uh... uh... writing is hard."
33350,Homer,"if i had won class president, i'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now."
33351,Homer,"yup -- back in high school, right before i met your mother. a simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation..."
33371,Homer,what will this box reveal? and what will i use this box for afterwards? mismatched nuts and bolts? recipes? i may never know.
33383,Homer,i respect your choice. now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a tom collins.
33390,Homer,"i would've been a winner, instead of some idiot spending his saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce. why did fate do this to me?"
33395,Homer,"hey, debbie, um... wanna go to prom with me?"
33400,Homer,"sorry, debbie. i hope you can find happiness without me."
33403,Homer,sweet dreams.
33415,Homer,"oh, why would you bring me here?! it's like bringing richard nixon to the watergate! or kevin costner to waterworld!"
33424,Homer,"ooh, that sounds like fun!"
33425,Homer,"...three, two, one. happy new year!"
33427,Homer,who taught you that language?!
33436,Homer,this was due two weeks ago! i'm not insured! for the first time in my life i'm financially responsible for my own actions!
33439,Homer,dear. stupid. insurance. company. i. meant. to. mail this. on time. what. do you. mean. too bad? screw. you! heh. heh.
33440,Homer,"i won't be insured until three o'clock?! okay, until then, i have to avoid any serious injuries or accidents on my property, or i'm ruined."
33448,Homer,"okay, i just have to keep these tipsy witches safe for ten more seconds."
33449,Homer,kniiiife!
33457,Homer,"i know they do, but the simpson mardi gras party has been a tradition since two days before you were born. and we spare no expense."
33459,Homer,"ladies, how're you doing with the float?"
33463,Homer,fine. i'll invite him. but he has to wear the outfit i choose.
33465,Homer,"so, anyway, if you're not doing anything, and it looks like you are, you're welcome to stop by, or not."
33469,Homer,"marge, don't worry. it's like when we stopped paying the phone bill. they stopped calling us. in fact, everyone did!"
33471,Homer,"listen, you! when you gave me that money, you said i wouldn't have to repay it till the future! this isn't the future! it's the lousy, stinking now!"
33472,Homer,that poor man. is he okay?
33477,Homer,"and on the zillionth day, god created hugs."
33479,Homer,"uh, uh, uh, uh, better let me go first. i left a little uh ""surprise"" upstairs for the new owner."
33481,Homer,no problem. just let sir fix-a-lot slay this chore.
33483,Homer,it's so beautiful. no two are exactly alike. though many of them are very similar.
33496,Homer,i'm the victim here!
33504,Homer,he's nailing something to our door.
33510,Homer,"hey, flanders. you can't evict us because a senior's living here now."
33511,Homer,will you kids knock it off? i'm trying to watch badminton!
33512,Homer,"well, i guess we can take a quick walk. we'll keep grampa occupied with this dvd of dwight eisenhower talking about golf."
33516,Homer,"well, i can't compete with that!"
33527,Homer,we'll be talking about this together for years!
33533,Homer,"aw, rats in the kitchen. just like that delightful movie i taped in the theater."
33534,Homer,"ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots vichy."
33537,Homer,"no, you stupid dog -- that's maggie's bunny!"
33538,Homer,not in front of the poison man!
33539,Homer,"whoever's biting me, stop it!"
33541,Homer,how am i gonna get us all across this river?
33544,Homer,"let's see: i need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but i can only take one thing at a time. i can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and i can't leave the dog alone with the baby."
33561,Homer,are you sure you don't want me to do it? 'cause i can do it. i got the outfit right here.
33566,Homer,"you told me something, but i wasn't listening!"
33571,Homer,hot tubs!
33574,Homer,"please, can i get it, marge? please? please?"
33588,Homer,"sir, i brought my father thousands of miles just to drink at your bar."
33595,Homer,why you...
33596,Homer,uh-oh.
33601,Homer,ireland doesn't like pubs anymore. it's as if danish people stopped liking sleek modern design.
33608,Homer,i can't tell if those are questions or statements.
33609,Homer,"don't worry, dad. we'll get out. america is the new york yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand."
33615,Homer,suckers!
33617,Homer,"you don't get it, padre. my old lady and i have a thing goin' on. we don't need a piece of paper to keep it real."
33620,Homer,"sweetie, any place i'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world."
33628,Homer,maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. and that would be a big surprise because i'd forget about it pretty quick.
33632,Homer,why not?
33636,Homer,what the? i'm chained up like a common bicycle!
33641,Homer,"you idiot! how am i ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is!"
33662,Homer,"the score, damn you!"
33665,Homer,yes?
33675,Homer,"hey, maggie could play out there... while i watch her from in here. whaddaya say, maggie?"
33677,Homer,hello maggie... hello maggie.
33680,Homer,"i can too! ""there once was this guy from an island off the coast of massachusetts... uh, nantucket, i think it was. anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh..."
33682,Homer,aww. innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. how sweet. maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.
33685,Homer,"pleased to meet you. uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but i have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that i can't help wondering about."
33719,Homer,water!
33721,Homer,"burn, barty, burn!"
33724,Homer,"i held up two, for ""peely!"""
33729,Homer,"doctor, why is this happening to me?"
33730,Homer,i can't eat tacos?! oh my god -- what day of mayo is it?
33732,Homer,i still taste over-tones of pink!
33735,Homer,"man, who comes up with this stuff?"
33736,Homer,don't have one.
33738,Homer,"oh, come on, relax, i won't embarrass you."
33740,Homer,"oh, i'm big and yellow / and i'm servin' jell-o / if you're a fellow and you want some jell-o / you'd better bellow / hey, big guy / gimme some jell-o"
33743,Homer,"hey, there we go."
33744,Homer,"don't worry, i won't embarrass you."
33745,Homer,"buddy, i'm here to eat, not make interesting conversation."
33749,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you come to school to help him get good grades? isn't that why we pay public school teachers those enormous salaries?"
33751,Homer,"yeah, you don't see many presidents doing that. maybe l.b.j. -- you know, at the end."
33754,Homer,"marge, where have you been?"
33771,Homer,it tells you how you can get popular.
33777,Homer,"and that, my dear girl, is called the toledo take-back."
33788,Homer,brittany and kaitlin are here! where's my spray-on tan?
33791,Homer,i am such a great parent to both my kids.
33795,Homer,"naw, that kinda creeps me out."
33800,Homer,oscar wilde?
33804,Homer,now we could smash the real westminster abbey so it looks like this.
33814,Homer,it was stuffed with cash!
33817,Homer,"i can't understand that math reference, because i went to springfield elementary!"
33820,Homer,"i need to rent an apartment in the worst part of waverly hills -- the crappier, the better."
33826,Homer,tempting. tempting. where's the bathroom?
33827,Homer,i'll take it!
33828,Homer,waverly hills / that's where i want to be / squatting in waverly hills. / waverly hills / get education fraudulently / moochin' off waverly hills.
33843,Homer,marge! i'm glad you came. there's a kegger down the hall. we can go as soon as i desecrate this corpse.
33844,Homer,"eat butt, skyboy-ninety-four! i'm sorry, marge. where are my manners? did you want to taunt my kill also? press the x button."
33855,Homer,try the flan de leche de cabra...
33860,Homer,what movie?
33866,Homer,i can't leave my bachelor pad! my bros'll miss me!
33871,Homer,"marge, i need some bribe money!"
33872,Homer,"thanks, marge. but don't forget, there's still gonna be a civil suit."
33874,Homer,"hey, there's no way i could ever be as good as that guy."
33875,Homer,you're not suggesting... murder.
33883,Homer,"""dammit, morpheus. not everyone believes what you believe."""
33889,Homer,why do they write a new review of this play every single day?
33896,Homer,it's my moment.
33904,Homer,"great. okay. marge, go."
33905,Homer,you? awesome. next.
33907,Homer,"time's up! okay, maggie: ""suck, suck,"" that takes us to... me."
33914,Homer,because i'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?
33917,Homer,this montage sounds really exhausting. how 'bout i just do a walking around sad montage?
33921,Homer,was that tobey maguire?
33925,Homer,your other hand.
33930,Homer,he's gone.
33939,Homer,"nag, nag, nag."
33951,Homer,"okay look, there's a big football game on tonight, so we can get this thing over real quick. show me some of bart's artwork, give me a little false hope, and here's a little something to help with his grades."
33954,Homer,"i said, are there any areas that we, his parents, can improve upon?"
33958,Homer,"when you say ""teacher,"" do you really mean ""parent?"""
33965,Homer,"ah yes, filthy, but obscure. with a subtle scatological undertone."
33967,Homer,"now listen, son, i know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight, but remember: don't try this at home. do it at the schoolyard. someplace where, if you get hurt, we can sue, not just them, but the school, the county, the state, and that jackass joe biden."
33973,Homer,what'd i miss?
33980,Homer,i'll bash him with this book!
33986,Homer,"marge, i tried my best to talk you out of this. but since you're going through with it, i beg you, just stay out of his way and don't get hurt."
33995,Homer,really?
33998,Homer,you mean tell her i love her? or i meaning you?
33999,Homer,i'll just high-five her.
34001,Homer,to the panic room!
34019,Homer,i recommend / our dear old friend / bartender moe szyslak!
34027,Homer,"hey carl, why aren't you high-fiving?"
34028,Homer,"you see, he hasn't changed!"
34032,Homer,"why can't i keep the job i have now, whatever it is?"
34033,Homer,"not an option, big fella. either you're my assistant, or you find a job elsewhere -- and in this economy, elsewhere ain't hirin'!"
34035,Homer,nooooooo!
34036,Homer,calendar! oh my god! i forgot to move carl's twelve-thirty to two-thirty.
34038,Homer,"marge, would you mind if we just cuddle?"
34042,Homer,"ocean view, obstructed."
34048,Homer,"i'll make it up to you, marge, i swear."
34057,Homer,in springfield.
34061,Homer,oh wouldn't i? just listen.
34062,Homer,"allo, you are getting cozy with sarkozy."
34063,Homer,"okay, okay, you win!"
34065,Homer,"marge, i believe we have a little unfinished business. come with me!"
34076,Homer,bonk it. twist it. smack it.
34077,Homer,what happened?
34078,Homer,where's the hooch?
34081,Homer,lisa! lisa!
34087,Homer,start the ride!
34090,Homer,back to the horses! back to the horses!
34094,Homer,"girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and i don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause i don't know."
34105,Homer,and turn that upside down...
34106,Homer,...don't look at that...
34111,Homer,"well, welcome, charlie! nice to meet ya! no glasses -- way to go! this one's a keeper!"
34116,Homer,"yeah. it sounded like naked bacon to me. i don't know why they say you're the dumb guy, tom."
34120,Homer,now to seal you in for safety.
34122,Homer,"dad, bathing suit!"
34126,Homer,"no, i get my news off the internet."
34127,Homer,it's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... my father is interesting?! the whole world's upside down! that must mean cathy is funny.
34128,Homer,nope.
34129,Homer,how come grampa never shares those stories with us?
34136,Homer,that's it! here's your ring back.
34143,Homer,"i'll show grampa. i'll find my own surrogate father, full of heart-warming stories i can share with the world."
34152,Homer,a little lower... a little lower...
34159,Homer,...and that lasted about five years. but then godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies. all of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist.
34160,Homer,"aw c'mon, marge. there's nothing funnier than a good ol' bonk on the head."
34161,Homer,not funny.
34163,Homer,"...groaning with a ""united nations"" of donuts: jellies rubbing elbows with cream-filled, the masculine contours of the box juxtaposed with the feminine curves of the treats themselves..."
34173,Homer,"man, a lion would not want to see that on his x-ray!"
34174,Homer,"goodbye, power plant. i'd better get out of here before i have a meltdown."
34177,Homer,and you like potato...
34180,Homer,tomato!
34185,Homer,"she's not my girlfriend. she's a girl who i married, who used to be my friend."
34186,Homer,"""today is your lucky day."" yeah, pfft!"
34188,Homer,"hmm, maybe this is my lucky day."
34191,Homer,"oooh, what a lucky man..."
34197,Homer,"uh-oh, here comes a train."
34200,Homer,"one, six, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-four, thirty-five."
34208,Homer,"barn, thanks for picking up the money for me."
34210,Homer,oh yeah.
34211,Homer,marge? what are you doing?
34214,Homer,i know. it's where i hide my adult magazines.
34222,Homer,hm. not as much money as there used to be.
34223,Homer,why... i'm just...
34228,Homer,here.
34237,Homer,"blackmail your father in space, will you?!"
34238,Homer,"up -- that's my chair, boy."
34240,Homer,i agreed to no such thing!
34241,Homer,where and what time?
34247,Homer,"okay, i'm taking off the blindfold..."
34248,Homer,surprised?
34250,Homer,you have a right to be angry. furious! and even though that ticket won a million dollars and--
34253,Homer,"marge, those groves of cherry blossoms will bloom every year, to remind the world of the sweetest, most forgiving woman who ever lived... am i off the hook?"
34256,Homer,"carl, you're a liar, but i love it."
34259,Homer,it'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.
34267,Homer,"marge, this is perfect for both of us! it's got bowling for me and sweeping for you!"
34276,Homer,how can i ever thank you?
34277,Homer,i couldn't hear the last thing you said! goodbye forever!
34282,Homer,that's my marge! high-five!
34293,Homer,"wonderful, homie."
34311,Homer,"c'est la vie, baby."
34314,Homer,a little!
34322,Homer,"until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair."
34323,Homer,"too late, marge. i already used a ""prayer block"" on your prayer."
34326,Homer,you don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.
34332,Homer,well how could i ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!
34339,Homer,"oh my god, i killed her!"
34342,Homer,we can't let bart drive us apart. he's the reason we had to get married.
34346,Homer,"you may not realize this, bart, but your mother and i have been fighting about you a lot lately. and i've realized our marriage is more important than your future. from now on, you're on your own."
34347,Homer,"uh, marge? i don't want to ruin the moment, but you got something stuck between your-- ohhh..."
34356,Homer,"oh, there's a nickel."
34357,Homer,well i'll be! there's a sofa in here!
34360,Homer,woo hoo!
34363,Homer,"thanks to our new g.p.s., i'll have you at school in no time."
34365,Homer,stupid kid. thinks he's smarter than a computer.
34367,Homer,why you...
34373,Homer,well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.
34376,Homer,"well, don't worry, boy. i know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls."
34379,Homer,i finally caught one of bart's school plays.
34381,Homer,why you little...
34391,Homer,after we see the stations of the omelet bar.
34406,Homer,give my dad another heart attack?!
34415,Homer,"ned! ned, wait up!"
34418,Homer,ah-ha -- a sand horse! car of the desert!
34422,Homer,thir-sty / i am so thir-sty / and hungry and horny / but mostly just thir-sty / i am so thir-sty...
34424,Homer,so salty... maybe if i... add a little salt...
34427,Homer,"i am more than alive, woman! i am the chosen one who shall unite all the faiths of the holy land! i am... the messiah!"
34429,Homer,the messiah! has the passports.
34436,Homer,"because when you get down to it, aren't all religions the same? they tell you what to eat, when to pray... how this imperfect clay that we call man can mold itself to resemble the divine. but we can never attain that ultimate grace while there is hatred in our hearts for each other."
34441,Homer,how 'bout a greg norman executive putter from the sky mall?
34448,Homer,the government. taking my hard-earned stolen wine and spending it on that no-good floor.
34457,Homer,patty and selma are dead? woo hoo! a double funeral!
34460,Homer,"mr. smithers, our lives are awesome, thanks to you. and because i know you ""like your loafers light,"" i want to give something back."
34461,Homer,use that image any way you want.
34469,Homer,"i never thought i'd say this, but i wish mr. burns was back."
34471,Homer,"the war is over and the future won. the past never had a chance, man!"
34483,Homer,oh yeah. all the time. they say it's 'cause i'm overweight.
34490,Homer,wow. so this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady.
34491,Homer,want some sugar?
34495,Homer,really? me?
34503,Homer,"ahhh, that is so much better than hospital beer."
34511,Homer,"hey man, you planted that!"
34516,Homer,"well, i was kind of ungrateful. you did save my life."
34522,Homer,"no, ice cold."
34523,Homer,look at this electric bill! i'm not made of money! i'm made of man-meat and a skeleton!
34524,Homer,"it's time to unplug these vampire appliances that plunge their prongs into our creamy white outlets to quench their unholy thirst for electrons. lamp, computer, jacob's ladder..."
34526,Homer,are you calling me fat?
34528,Homer,"now, on to the next funny booth."
34534,Homer,i'm starting to regret it already.
34540,Homer,"gentlemen, tonight's game is brought to us by something special. the kite's best friend, the flag's partner in patriotism, you've seen cherubs blow it from map corners -- the wind!"
34547,Homer,now we're cookin' with wind!
34551,Homer,all right -- let me get my tool belt.
34552,Homer,"man, who are these belts made for, french supermodels?"
34566,Homer,"i'm trying to be a sensitive father, you unwanted moron! lisa, where were we?"
34574,Homer,nature is a toothless dying hag! we are gonna save those whale babies!
34577,Homer,oh come on! leave me alone! i'm trying to save your precious whales!
34580,Homer,"sharks, innocent? please. every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things. the shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing: the crime of murder..."
34583,Homer,"thanks, buddy!"
34584,Homer,"hey, i'd do anything for a sweet intelligent mammal, by which i mean you."
34593,Homer,i am pretty full.
34597,Homer,/
34599,Homer,i'm goin' home. it's not safe in here.
34604,Homer,"remember how you wanted me to get that expensive operation? well, now i can afford a motorcycle!"
34605,Homer,who wants feet steak?
34610,Homer,"god created the devil? finally, he did something cool."
34614,Homer,"i like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach."
34623,Homer,moe is running off with one of our wives?!
34628,Homer,can't talk! must text!
34639,Homer,you take that back!
34641,Homer,i'm doomed.
34648,Homer,"otto, you got to get us back to town!"
34652,Homer,painting supplies?!
34655,Homer,"moe, i don't know whether to punch you or kiss you... so i'm gonna do both."
34659,Homer,...initial the radon disclosure... and done.
34662,Homer,"or frasier on ""frasier."""
34663,Homer,"stupid kid, fooled by a silhouette."
34664,Homer,ice cream!
34665,Homer,nothing is ever boobs or ice cream.
34666,Homer,"marge, the bathroom scale is lying again."
34670,Homer,"man, that dude does not like bart."
34672,Homer,"help us! help us, for the love of god! won't somebody help us?!"
34674,Homer,"yes, that's exactly the word i want to translate."
34675,Homer,"oh, yeah, yeah, right. uh, just give me one of those crispy shells with meat in it."
34676,Homer,stop! stop! stop!
34678,Homer,hmmmm. not ugly enough. i want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this.
34683,Homer,"but if we win this, we get a gift certificate."
34691,Homer,after the title page it's bob dole's memoirs.
34701,Homer,"don't worry, i got it!"
34716,Homer,woo hoo! we're region one! we're region one!
34720,Homer,"five hundred dollars? that's, like, ten dead grampas! some of us stuck to our limit, marge. and i would've loved to rent this carpet cleaner another day!"
34722,Homer,"you know what, honey? just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town."
34729,Homer,check and mate.
34739,Homer,yes... uh... maybe i'll just come back during someone else's shift... is claire working today? she's a real sucker.
34741,Homer,"it's not what you think... i came here to warn them... yes, to warn them about, um..."
34743,Homer,"i have to sign a release so you can broadcast this, right?"
34748,Homer,"that's a problem for future homer. man, i don't envy that guy."
34752,Homer,i'll put a stop to this nonsense!
34754,Homer,"boys don't have feelings, they have muscles."
34757,Homer,...dislocating fosse's shoulder in a meaningless game...
34758,Homer,"...he had earned the nickname ""charlie hustle..."""
34759,Homer,"if he makes it, that's my son!"
34761,Homer,"oh man, i'm never comin' down."
34767,Homer,"what is it? lenny, i'm on a second honeymoon. you'll have to pick your own lotto numbers. now, where were we?"
34769,Homer,"oh yeah baby, i like it when you're distracted."
34775,Homer,"hey, i've had a hard trip too. one of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses."
34777,Homer,i don't trust that guy. i bet he killed everyone on that boat himself.
34784,Homer,never mind.
34794,Homer,"oh, come on! just a second..."
34797,Homer,"marge, what are you doing? that pie is poisoned!"
34798,Homer,she just wanted to ride bikes through new england. but those seats hurt my ass!
34803,Homer,"okay, okay. if you bite your tongue, does it become a vampire?"
34804,Homer,"man, you vamps got it made... you sleep all day..."
34819,Homer,"maggie, you can't climb into the tv. if you could, i'd make alex trebek answer some questions."
34822,Homer,you can't tell what's inside! of all the times not to have x-ray vision.
34832,Homer,just don't dress me up like a woman.
34837,Homer,"oh, that's probably because to her, the saxophone is a me, and she doesn't want to end up like you. g'night."
34844,Homer,that would be one weird-looking kid.
34845,Homer,"oh, i've seen that look before. that's the ""i ate the piece of wedding cake she's been saving in the freezer ten years"" look."
34846,Homer,run!
34848,Homer,what time monday?
34853,Homer,"up, a father has his secrets."
34858,Homer,hell yeah!
34863,Homer,amen.
34869,Homer,you're welcome!
34877,Homer,"all finished, boy."
34878,Homer,flimsy? this gentle pat says different.
34883,Homer,danica patrick in my thoughts!
34884,Homer,ended that a little too soon.
34887,Homer,"come on out, birdie! follow the sound of my voice-voice-voice."
34891,Homer,why can't you support my gibberish? i'd do it if you were stupid!
34896,Homer,"nicely done, boy."
34910,Homer,maggie.
34914,Homer,it's almost over.
34915,Homer,now to take care of the witnesses.
34925,Homer,"someday tv will be invented, and it will be free. then it will cost money."
34927,Homer,now we just have to make it.
34928,Homer,you'll be oh so pleased / when the o.j. is freshly-squeezed / and toast is made from homemade
34933,Homer,i got the week off by telling mr. burns i had a neck injury!
34941,Homer,"sweetie, relax. let's just watch some tv."
34944,Homer,what the hell?!
34947,Homer,this is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it's ruined.
34951,Homer,"chief, this is just a big misunderstanding. i meant to write ""bride."" it's a wedding present."
34961,Homer,"okay, melvin mafia."
34962,Homer,can i keep the name after i'm done?
34963,Homer,ayyyy! ohhhh! ayyyy! ohhhh!
34971,Homer,but i haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.
34975,Homer,oh. that beating.
34977,Homer,that's so mean!
34980,Homer,how're you gonna do that?
34981,Homer,i'll take care of this.
34985,Homer,oh yeah. i got in your gang and you barely know who i am.
34988,Homer,oh no! no! i... was uh... just thinking how cheap this crime would have been in the seventies when gas was thirty-five cents a gallon.
35001,Homer,poor tony. he didn't deserve this. he was just a soldier in a war he started.
35002,Homer,"it's not over, marge. it'll never be over. when i shut my eyes, all i see is fat tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach."
35007,Homer,"wow, i've never seen a mobster use a tracksuit for exercising."
35009,Homer,"do what you gotta do. the quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there."
35012,Homer,he took me to a fight that he fixed. but he never let on. not even when i bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. then he said he would dope a horse for me.
35015,Homer,and your enemies closer?
35019,Homer,stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family. and the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby.
35020,Homer,"and i have to admit, it's a pretty good life."
35027,Homer,"ooh, i got a text!"
35030,Homer,anyone see a good beer commercial lately?
35031,Homer,"sure, i'll stay home and skype with the guys at moe's."
35035,Homer,"hey, marge. partaking of the grape, were we?"
35039,Homer,"ooh, three!"
35050,Homer,he's washing his hands.
35051,Homer,wait a minute! your standard markup is four hundred percent?
35056,Homer,everyone in that live studio audience is dead now.
35057,Homer,"lisa, mash the buttons till something good comes on."
35064,Homer,hm. i never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid.
35065,Homer,"son, i won't strangle you anymore, but i also won't get you that mini-bike."
35080,Homer,"yeah, i do know a lot about nuclears."
35084,Homer,awww...
35086,Homer,"check this out, bart. one of those retinal scan dealies. it only opens to my eye or an exact copy."
35088,Homer,"damn, that hurt!"
35090,Homer,because you've been such a great kid lately and i wanted to show you i appreciated it.
35092,Homer,where is he going?
35096,Homer,i know what you're saying! i understand food talk in every language!
35101,Homer,"cherish that family smile / picket fence days go something something / the future is coming soon / mom and dad and kids are sommmmething that's my favorite song now. sorry ""don't fear the reaper."" everybody! air guitar! come on, do it with me! use your whammy bar! whew! now fuzz it up! excellent!"
35106,Homer,stupid double snuggler's hitch! only hope is to chew off my leg.
35123,Homer,uh-oh. usually when it gets this quiet mr. burns is standing behind me.
35139,Homer,"so, what brings you here, mr. chair?"
35149,Homer,"there's something going on at the nuclear plant that's a little more important that your ""table read."""
35150,Homer,"""family, today i graduate from my anger management class."""
35154,Homer,woo hoo!
35166,Homer,"oh, hi! ricky gervais, umm such an honor to meet you, sir ridley. i love your movies. or as i call them, ""films."" umm, glad i bumped into you, actually. because, uh, i'm looking to expand beyond comedy. i know what you're thinking, sir ridley. you're thinking ""oh my word, he's been making me laugh all these years, but now he's moving me as well. i'm gonna have to put him in my new film. what do you think?"
35167,Homer,i'm a seat filler.
35170,Homer,"that's great, honey. if you were a boy, you'd be a scientist."
35172,Homer,it does!
35175,Homer,"uh, you look tense. let's discuss this over a cup of grampa's coffee."
35176,Homer,your kisses feel like raw liver.
35186,Homer,your grandfather is not a monster.
35189,Homer,"so, i guess we're all in the same boat, huh?"
35197,Homer,"bart, cheech and chong were the beavis and butthead of their day!"
35201,Homer,hide the dope!
35202,Homer,then what did i just smoke?
35205,Homer,dave's not here! dave's not here!
35206,Homer,oh no! chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.
35210,Homer,"dave's not here, man!"
35211,Homer,i'll give dave your message.
35221,Homer,cheech and chong has lost its chong / i am the chong now... take a little look / take a little look / take a little look at me-e...
35224,Homer,cheech is sure a lot less cool / than i imagined...
35231,Homer,can we at least get some french fries?
35233,Homer,it's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from cheech and chunk.
35234,Homer,"yes, sir."
35242,Homer,"come on, surrender to the moment! don't make the mistake i always do of thinking too much before you act!"
35257,Homer,"uh, super bowl tickets?... playoff tickets?... regular season, bobble-head day?"
35260,Homer,"everybody dance now! do, do, do, do / do, do, do, do..."
35275,Homer,i'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.
35277,Homer,i miss my friends from drunk driving school. they were so cool.
35278,Homer,"well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. but, oh, you know, the other day, bart, the little dickens, said i had an elephant butt. so anyway, i'm strangling him, and i said to bart..."
35282,Homer,who do you have next period?
35283,Homer,"hey, doc. where is everybody?"
35284,Homer,why didn't you tell me not to come?
35286,Homer,"no doc, please! i'm just a little boy!"
35288,Homer,"um, i uh, lied about having health insurance."
35290,Homer,i want you to know i'm cured.
35296,Homer,i'll teach you to...
35301,Homer,all right.
35306,Homer,"i-i said my keys-ter is ready for a whooping, sir."
35321,Homer,"masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything."
35323,Homer,"hello, boat store? i'd like to order a boat. what do you mean, dial tone?"
35329,Homer,"hey, let me down! this is gonna leave a diamond pattern on my skin!"
35334,Homer,"i was standing in this line to use the bathroom, but now my license is expired."
35339,Homer,"well, well, well, if it isn't ""before"" and ""after."" blob and blob lite. tweedle yuck and tweedle blecch."
35342,Homer,you are cruel but fair.
35344,Homer,dammit!
35346,Homer,i decorated her car for nothing.
35354,Homer,"yeah, that's his thing. anyway, fat tony and i think this is a chance to patch things up between you and selma. plus it's a free weekend at the beach."
35364,Homer,how could tony cheat on me so soon?
35365,Homer,"y'know selma, from what i've seen here, fat tony has a lot of bad influences on him. i walked though a door last night and they were playing cards for real money."
35366,Homer,"aw, can't we stay one more day? the occurrence and i are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled."
35371,Homer,"i get to enjoy this, but i'm not responsible."
35372,Homer,"actually, dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too."
35374,Homer,"fine, whatever."
35379,Homer,who undid my do?
35383,Homer,"lady, i'm not a hairdresser -- i just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans."
35384,Homer,"a hundred dollars?! marge, how much is that in smackaroos?"
35389,Homer,"now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, i dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe i should open a hair salon."
35395,Homer,is there anyone in here that just wants a haircut with no chitchat?
35398,Homer,"all day long they tell me stupid, pointless, boring stories, and i have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face."
35400,Homer,"sorry sarah, i'm retired."
35418,Homer,awww...
35422,Homer,woo hoo!
35431,Homer,"well, it might have been the time when..."
35432,Homer,no.
35434,Homer,oh my god... there's the fire brewer... the beechwood ager... the rat filter...
35435,Homer,"the duff blimp! oh, how i'd love to drive that thing."
35446,Homer,"bart, take the controls!"
35450,Homer,"i'll save you, honey!"
35466,Homer,"well, if it isn't the local school marm... and his new girlfriend. that's a burn on you, flanders."
35474,Homer,"ned, let's cut to the chase."
35475,Homer,"ned, if it's boneheaded to talk you outta seein' edna, then i don't wanna be brainheaded."
35477,Homer,"oh, you beautiful, beautiful wuss."
35486,Homer,"wha? my doctor said ""don't walk."""
35490,Homer,"and didn't the easter bunny himself say ""forgive them, father, for finding all my eggs?"" and if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and edna can find a way to make it work."
35499,Homer,duck in the bathroom.
35514,Homer,"well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping."
35515,Homer,"as god as my witness, this fist will be bumped."
35520,Homer,wayne!
35527,Homer,wayne?
35530,Homer,sure. why not.
35531,Homer,it's best to concentrate on what you do have.
35533,Homer,why don't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet?
35535,Homer,"that's funny, because i have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future."
35538,Homer,or maybe it was him.
35539,Homer,"man, this robot really gets me."
35540,Homer,"your voice is so gravelly, just like lauren bacall's."
35541,Homer,"neh, they couldn't find a google map photo without me naked or urinating."
35542,Homer,"not the one you're thinking of, there's another one."
35552,Homer,what will you guys use when there aren't newspapers anymore?
35561,Homer,cold. so cold.
35564,Homer,i don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.
35568,Homer,"here's one thousand dollars... two thousand dollars... three thousand dollars... ooh, i need more cash. better go to my invisible atm."
35569,Homer,what? two dollar charge for non-network bank?!
35571,Homer,"marge, i parented!"
35579,Homer,okay... i'm on the floor... i can't move... so far a normal sunday morning.
35580,Homer,this is so horrible -- i can't speak...
35583,Homer,where's that spider?
35592,Homer,"oh man, what's this bite gonna do? my wrists are tingling... i feel new powers surging within me..."
35607,Homer,so your dad has money to lend?
35608,Homer,this is where we get our coffee. just leave a little at the bottom so someone else has to make the next pot. the burning smell will let them know.
35618,Homer,why would a homer humiliator do this to me?
35619,Homer,"y'ello. hey, barney... a free movie screening? of course i can go! i just need somebody to hold down the fort."
35624,Homer,someone snitched? wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me?
35627,Homer,"i'm telling you guys, roz told old man burns i ditched work early and now i'm her assistant."
35631,Homer,"do you know what i just learned? my job is the reason i get those checks every week! and now that i'm demoted, the checks have gotten smaller! not in physical size, but--"
35636,Homer,can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones?
35644,Homer,hail flanders! mightier than jesus!
35648,Homer,hug! hug! hug!
35649,Homer,i don't know what that middle word means.
35654,Homer,"this saturday, from the dad who brought you ""cemetery paintball"" and ""go-karts on real roads,"" comes the greatest activity yet..."
35670,Homer,"marge, the kids are acting ethnic!"
35673,Homer,"oh, and here's my favorite restaurant: ""la fridge!"" it's open twenty-four hours a day and there's no dress code!"
35674,Homer,"all right, food nerds, reality check..."
35676,Homer,i'll remind you kids what real fun is!
35680,Homer,jealous? me?! that is to laugh! the very idea... if anything you're the one who's jealous!
35681,Homer,of how much fun i am to be around! it's always a party with fun dad!
35687,Homer,kids! guess what? mom invited me to your fancy dinner!
35689,Homer,food dad! food dad! food dad!
35697,Homer,here it is: 1501 east oak. no name on the door -- very trendy.
35702,Homer,"ouch, this place is fancy."
35708,Homer,sorry!
35711,Homer,family fun day.
35712,Homer,ex-tinct!
35713,Homer,"we're not here for you, we're here for lenny."
35714,Homer,"yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?"
35731,Homer,"come on beautiful, i can't do the job without you, so what do you say?"
35735,Homer,"relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in shelbyville."
35736,Homer,"wait, you're gonna be all the guys? how would that work?"
35737,Homer,"okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!"
35743,Homer,woo-hoo!
35748,Homer,"gentlemen! to ""the troll twins of underbridge academy!"""
35749,Homer,"so, does this square us for kansas city?"
35752,Homer,"oh, that is so untroll-y!"
35753,Homer,british fonzie is right. our story is actually more important... than money.
35754,Homer,somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.
35768,Homer,"it's never good. i always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet..."
35770,Homer,"well, in that case..."
35771,Homer,woo hoo! no more church!
35774,Homer,i thought you were retiring. why are you still here?
35779,Homer,"yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect."
35780,Homer,"wow, i can't believe i'm eating steak with the mayor. the next time i vote for you it's gonna be on purpose."
35789,Homer,"okay, let's go."
35791,Homer,"it's a rat race, but it looks like i won."
35798,Homer,"it already is killing me, marge. you're the only one i can talk to. my wife just doesn't get it."
35813,Homer,"not sure what you're going for, but"
35817,Homer,"uh-oh. if you've got that, then..."
35825,Homer,i'm okay! and i found some gold!
35826,Homer,"yep, your worries are over. i'm back to being a boring old safety inspector at a nuclear power plant."
35830,Homer,and people will see my tattoo of donald duck smoking a doob! that was for marge's eyes only! oh my god!
35831,Homer,fatso flanagan!
35833,Homer,"everything's a rip-off of ""the honeymooners."" margie, you're the greatest."
35837,Homer,would i!
35847,Homer,"oh marge, how would you like some ""future sex""?"
35851,Homer,too late!
35858,Homer,"no, don't worry, i have my invisibility cloak. now where did i put it?"
35860,Homer,"he froze himself because he was sick, and there was no cure."
35861,Homer,"oh, they found it. but don't tell him. this is way cheaper than a nursing home."
35865,Homer,"your dad may be a little immature, but i know he loves you, so you ought to give him a chance."
35867,Homer,"if those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father, then maybe i can forgive..."
35869,Homer,finally. the only thing i wait in lines this long for are for slightly-better cell phones.
35870,Homer,i just don't understand the world of grownups.
35880,Homer,huh? what the--
35885,Homer,never putting me next to a pretty girl...
35891,Homer,and why is there moisture in between the windows?!
35895,Homer,"they love me! the quiet homer simpson that kept it all bottled up inside is dead. this is the birth of homer simpson, blowhard! i'm on the roll of my life! gimme a scratcher!"
35902,Homer,"now, i may not be some mani-pedied tv blowhard..."
35904,Homer,"yeah, that's what i'm talkin' about! those real people out there who buy their coffee from the mini-mart, and grab enough sugar packs for a week! honest, hardworking, sugar-stealing americans!"
35905,Homer,"aw, son. now i regret bad-mouthing you to that girl you liked."
35911,Homer,let's go to the map.
35914,Homer,goodnight and good gravy.
35917,Homer,this is going so great. i'm already a halloween mask.
35920,Homer,why? oh why?
35927,Homer,so get on the boat... the gravy boat.
35929,Homer,just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an i.o.u.
35934,Homer,"now lisa, i'm an entertainer. and you can't entertain and inform at the same time. and if you're access hollywood, you do neither!"
35935,Homer,i don't know. can't we get chris christie to run?
35936,Homer,"eh, maybe i'll vote democrat. the great thing is when they get in they act like republicans."
35942,Homer,they sell some at the gas station.
35943,Homer,"so, how come your picture's not on money?"
35944,Homer,do you give 'em out for fans? 'cause i'm a fan.
35953,Homer,springfield colonial village?!
35954,Homer,what the?
35957,Homer,"well, if there's one thing i don't like being taught, it's a lesson. i'm so mad. not only will i endorse ted nugent...but i will call for an end to the direct election of senators."
35971,Homer,dammit! why do kids have heads?
35975,Homer,"no, no, no, no, let's see how long we can keep 'em waiting. everyone act like we're buckling up to go home."
35976,Homer,"marge, if you were married to da vinci, you wouldn't tell him not to da vinch."
35979,Homer,"this place is so great. when the trolley hits you, it doesn't even hurt."
35980,Homer,"you try it, maggie!"
35987,Homer,i don't trust this place. where are the cashiers?
36008,Homer,"...and that's why i really don't believe there's a god. thank you, and god bless america."
36011,Homer,needs flavor.
36012,Homer,that's better.
36020,Homer,"almost there, boy. almost there. almost there."
36021,Homer,i'm getting' closer. it's just within reach.
36029,Homer,"sorry, dad. i was afraid the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up."
36032,Homer,then you have a serious reading problem.
36035,Homer,"all right, everybody in!"
36060,Homer,"yep, i never realized how much i hated every single one of my friends and relatives."
36067,Homer,"you know what's great about you, marge? after all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you."
36075,Homer,we hate opera!
36080,Homer,"i was wrong, there are bad ideas! there are terrible ideas!"
36083,Homer,"now, i gotta warn you, if you find a little black thing on your pillow, it won't be a mint."
36098,Homer,apu! what are you doing out of your natural habitat?
36111,Homer,"normal, normal, normal, normal... uncharacteristic?! hm, a chew-through. what could have..."
36113,Homer,you let this monster into our home! where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!
36120,Homer,"boy, get out of that cage!"
36141,Homer,"oh, what's the use? when a man isn't a hero to his son, he's nothing."
36143,Homer,you just ruined my car.
36146,Homer,"both, but the rhinoceros doesn't know why. he's just trying to fit in."
36160,Homer,"nothin' better than a lazy saturday morning, lying in a warm, moist bed. because weekends are-- moist?!"
36165,Homer,"i like to watch lamar odom play x-box while his giant wife yells at him. is that so nuts? huh? yeah, shut you up."
36166,Homer,"now, i'm sure yesterday's incident of urination domination was a one-time deal. but just to make sure..."
36169,Homer,"deep down, i must be feeling guilty about getting my friends in trouble! and my problem won't stop till i make things right with them. but first, a little more sleep."
36179,Homer,"um, uh... probably just the fire alarm -- try to go back to sleep."
36180,Homer,you stupid...
36181,Homer,"son, i'm afraid the uralarm whiz-no-more 9000 is no joke."
36184,Homer,what?
36189,Homer,what do i do?
36200,Homer,"oh death, you're a lifesaver!"
36209,Homer,you left him because i tipped the boat over and ruined the vacation!
36210,Homer,"it's true! i failed the basic duty of childhood. and then when i took bart fishing, it all came back -- and the guilt made me wet the bed!"
36211,Homer,i'm cured. i'll never wet the bed again.
36233,Homer,"then i'd better soak up the alcohol with some food! oooh, cake!"
36238,Homer,comicon nerds!
36239,Homer,a must!
36243,Homer,"nice parking, idiot."
36246,Homer,"i said, workin' hard or hardly working? working hard or hardly working?! working hard or hardly working?!"
36251,Homer,maybe i should be heading home.
36277,Homer,"aw, jeez."
36279,Homer,no! i'm already using it to put my keys in!
36293,Homer,and his arm can be my back-scratcher.
36298,Homer,hey!
36306,Homer,long enough that me and marge can be one of those couples who just sit and hold hands.
36313,Homer,no.
36315,Homer,"c'mon, boy. we've gotta go home. i saved big bucks on the delivery charges."
36316,Homer,ahhh. doesn't get any better than this.
36320,Homer,seen it.
36328,Homer,wait a minute... that flashback raised more questions than it answered?!
36338,Homer,at last! this episode promises to finally answer one question!
36342,Homer,she walked away and slammed the door. what does it mean? what does it mean?
36343,Homer,oh that's such a first-take answer!
36357,Homer,"nice doin' business with you, boy."
36359,Homer,i never even got to realize this jacket was too small.
36360,Homer,"oh, marge... your names..."
36362,Homer,why does every sand castle require my participation?
36373,Homer,can i put my hand through you?
36388,Homer,yeah.
36392,Homer,"eight weeks paid vacation, and all because of a little bump on the noggin."
36394,Homer,"no, this is really good. i..."
36396,Homer,"well, i just got..."
36397,Homer,uh... i got... shelbyville radio in my car for a few minutes.
36399,Homer,"i have eight weeks paid vacation, and my family doesn't know."
36403,Homer,"my feet hurt, and my neck is cold."
36408,Homer,stradivarius cain!
36411,Homer,what the? no one can see you.
36418,Homer,you know what wood makes the best ventriloquist dummy: maple. how many hardboiled eggs do you think i can eat?
36421,Homer,"you're right, marge. i lied."
36423,Homer,and i spent all that time learning how to be a better husband. the kind of husband you deserve.
36429,Homer,no one likes you!
36432,Homer,we used to be like them.
36433,Homer,"actually, i was supposed to be back last week. we'll just wait for the call from human resources."
36440,Homer,woo hoo!
36446,Homer,"oh yes, lisa, very seriously. whee."
36455,Homer,what the?
36457,Homer,"tonight, you shall be at my right hand in heaven."
36459,Homer,uh-oh.
36460,Homer,"ooo, licorice!"
36462,Homer,i'm talkin' about this guy.
36464,Homer,"i mean i envy flanders, once again enjoying the joys of marriage. let's put it to a vote, america."
36474,Homer,i'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.
36475,Homer,because his avatar is darth maul! the second-coolest darth!
36483,Homer,will you stop this stupid crap? / i wanna take a nap!
36489,Homer,what are you talking about? y-you're right!
36496,Homer,"okay lisa, comin' up to make things better!"
36507,Homer,"boy, if anyone needs me i'll be taking a popcorn bath. it's a thing i read about in a men's health magazine in a dream."
36509,Homer,well... i also keep things interesting.
36510,Homer,"you see? hey, what are you looking at?"
36528,Homer,do you know you're missing your clothes?
36533,Homer,why you little... where's that ice cream?
36550,Homer,"come on, you can't look at that infinitely dense little guy and not want to feed it something!"
36557,Homer,treasures? gifts? you got it all wrong. that stuff is just our old--
36561,Homer,a hero.
36570,Homer,"oh, sweetie, sometimes a mysterious, invisible being from hell waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them. now go to bed."
36574,Homer,"hey, marge."
36579,Homer,"you, me and marge?"
36586,Homer,i'm on it!
36590,Homer,let automobile von bismarck give it a try.
36591,Homer,well...
36593,Homer,a reason? what could it be?
36594,Homer,"wow, an auto mechanic who tells the truth."
36596,Homer,"marge... do you think maybe there's another reason you don't like this car? um... um... a ""feelings"" reason?"
36598,Homer,"no, no, marge. i want you to explore your feelings."
36599,Homer,"an ""on purpose"" baby?"
36603,Homer,"and let me tell you, a towel rack will not support your weight."
36604,Homer,x's for eyes...
36609,Homer,it's true... that's how i got the money to buy you your necklace.
36619,Homer,"room for one, please."
36620,Homer,"honey, i'm sorry. it's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids."
36621,Homer,"emotionally, financially, the boy... i just didn't know how to tell you."
36625,Homer,"they just leave the maple syrup on the table, huh? how about that? that's trust, huh?"
36627,Homer,"um, i'd like to get back a donation made fifteen years ago by a simpson, homer. or it may be under the name thad supersperm."
36628,Homer,"i'll tell you what i want, marge. i want to make another simpson. the table with four legs is sturdier than the table with three. cubes are made of cheese, but pyramids are schemes. and anything that's half you is guaranteed fifty percent perfect."
36630,Homer,i'd like to buy back my sample.
36633,Homer,um... remember that corvette i had?
36646,Homer,"well, thought bubble marge said we should put it in a college fund for lisa."
36651,Homer,"a poker site is now safer than an american bank. has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?"
36653,Homer,"it's a classy operation. see, the little dealer's wearing a bowtie. cute."
36666,Homer,missing?! what kind of a prison are you people running here?
36667,Homer,"oh, it's hopeless! this room is like a museum of meaningless old crap. by which i mean every museum."
36671,Homer,"excuse me, have you seen this man?"
36681,Homer,that's where we live!
36686,Homer,well just what attracted you to my father?
36694,Homer,"listen, do you know this man?"
36695,Homer,dad!
36696,Homer,"dad, promise me you'll never wander off and make us explore your fascinating past again."
36698,Homer,"and i don't think you're boring. it's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. look at sunday night. there's like eight amazing shows. none of them on fox."
36702,Homer,the day my frisbee landed in your yard was the luckiest day of my life...
36703,Homer,he's a good boy.
36719,Homer,my dad used to tie me up when the ice cream truck went by. and now there's no amount of ice cream that'll make me feel full. so this should work!
36724,Homer,will you stop saying things that'll make me have to do something?
36733,Homer,stop!
36737,Homer,"just listen. if you kill those guys, you'll be as bad as they are."
36743,Homer,"you're making me mad and i want, i want to shoot you now! / i don't have to see it."
36755,Homer,"aw, that's tooth fairy money down the drain, sweetie. i never win anything. it's always some stupid jerk you've never heard of."
36764,Homer,"you can look at it this way...or this way...whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like ""tapped out."""
36774,Homer,woo hoo!
36786,Homer,"dough, sauce, cheese, topping. dough, sauce, cheese, topping."
36789,Homer,it still had eighty-eight percent of its charge!
36793,Homer,"keep your pants on, flanders."
36794,Homer,has the mypad risen?
36797,Homer,"well, this is how god would send me a message. in my back yard, hammock adjacent, in one short word in large print. what do you think he's trying to tell me, flanders?"
36803,Homer,hope is all around me!
36812,Homer,"beat it, ducks! i'm not old enough to have food for you! i'm sexy! young and sexy!"
36814,Homer,"don't you, drawing?"
36816,Homer,gotta eat the rest!
36818,Homer,"where did these ""devil donuts"" come from?"
36824,Homer,"... pitchfork, pointed tail... hooves are... cloven! we have logo, people. we have logo!"
36827,Homer,i would be honored to shake the hand that glazed this.
36828,Homer,tell me everything about you.
36829,Homer,you're from portland? i've heard of people being from there.
36833,Homer,our houses are the cheapest! the one next to me's been on sale forever! i see them lowering the price every morning when i go out to pee.
36837,Homer,i don't know how.
36855,Homer,i hope t-rex likes the present i made him.
36856,Homer,"homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are. if i show up with a ""toy"" from the ""store,"" like we would give ""our kids,"" then i've failed! and these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing!"
36859,Homer,are we still on for midnight bike riding?
36861,Homer,"o-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... we had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up."
36863,Homer,you? sticking up for your old man? you've never done that before.
36865,Homer,they can goatee... hell!
36866,Homer,"yeah, that's right, the friendship between the simpsons and the whatever-your-last-name-is-es-es is over!"
36868,Homer,could we at least agree to both hate flanders?
36871,Homer,"even flanders agrees! this is our neighborhood. we were here first, so you should leave."
36877,Homer,it's a hellhole!
36878,Homer,what happened to our town? everybody wears clothes from the past and uses computers from the future!
36880,Homer,"your organic, all-natural lifestyle has doomed us all!"
36883,Homer,i did it! i did it! i man-hugged!
36907,Homer,"prep, prep, prep..."
36911,Homer,"whoa, now i've gotta buy a corpse wagon. that's how they getcha."
36923,Homer,"i don't know what you just said, but it's wrong! wrong, wrong, wrong!"
36928,Homer,grampa always hated bongo and loved money so he sold bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped santa so i'd never get the toy i actually wanted--
36934,Homer,he still has my sweatshirt.
36935,Homer,"oh my god, dad... i owe you an apology. you saved bongo. i never understood that till now."
36936,Homer,"why would you think that, just because i put you in a home where they feed you dog food?"
36944,Homer,feed it to the dog.
36946,Homer,can't i keep an eye on that kid? he's fabulous.
36950,Homer,"what the--? ooh, it's hopeless."
36951,Homer,who the hell are you?
36954,Homer,...duck walk... infinitely worse...
36956,Homer,"i made it, kids! i am king of learning-ton castle!"
36958,Homer,what cool kid thing's in here?
36964,Homer,"i guess despite all our so-called civilization, anarchy lurks around every corner, like a racially-diverse street gang on a network cop show."
36966,Homer,sweet.
36968,Homer,"preppies? oh, i hate you guys! always partying on deck with your docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge!"
36980,Homer,i guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place.
36985,Homer,do not question the wisdom of tom skerritt.
36986,Homer,wow. your end of the world is better than my during the world.
36991,Homer,it's very late in the marriage to tell me that.
36996,Homer,there's no handle on this side!
36999,Homer,"uh-huh, where's the kids?"
37001,Homer,this is my daughter. she brings the gift of music to the new world.
37012,Homer,white rice or brown?
37015,Homer,"okay, everybody, keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something. if we miss it, we're dead."
37023,Homer,"goodbye, my electrical friends. i can't afford to use you, so i'm doing what any good american would do -- throw you away."
37024,Homer,parking meter?!
37028,Homer,lotta people at the dump today.
37033,Homer,"we're cool, right boy?"
37034,Homer,now to sleep the sleep of the just.
37036,Homer,"eat silver, copper!"
37039,Homer,"the pillows are safe at my workstation. as for the quarters... well, i'm ashamed to tell you what i did."
37044,Homer,you live like this?
37045,Homer,"dear lord, if thy tornado must take me, please let it take me to oz, but don't let flanders be the scarecrow!"
37046,Homer,"we made it, boy!"
37047,Homer,oh my god. oh my god. this counts as a walk!
37048,Homer,the tornado took old what's-his-name! i'm going after him!
37052,Homer,"maybe! look, you guys obviously know about weather, but i understand something much more predictable: women."
37055,Homer,i would never do that.
37068,Homer,good point. we'll find somebody else.
37080,Homer,"ooh, thanks, dad."
37087,Homer,you never know when you might wanna mail something.
37095,Homer,"suckers!!! oh wait, you've gotta initial this."
37098,Homer,"marge, no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit."
37099,Homer,it helps me write.
37101,Homer,i don't like the way they just rip the paper off. santa's little helper my ass.
37103,Homer,"like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young."
37107,Homer,"marge, let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids. but those kids are ours, because we made them, by accident. and now, we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them."
37110,Homer,"sure you wanted the fun parts, but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals?"
37112,Homer,we've won. woo hoo.
37116,Homer,i win!
37117,Homer,i forget.
37118,Homer,"ladies, please! you can boss me around, just one at a time!"
37119,Homer,what the?
37121,Homer,thank god i wore the underwear with the hole on the side.
37123,Homer,"listen to your sister, boy."
37130,Homer,"finally, we're gettin' somewhere."
37131,Homer,"hand me my suitcase, boy."
37132,Homer,when you're older.
37138,Homer,not again!
37146,Homer,after we finish watching the movie.
37149,Homer,marge you will get the last pork chop...
37153,Homer,"honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like prohibition, it will end in a hail of bullets."
37155,Homer,"if i buy you, why do i need all these books?"
37161,Homer,got 'em!
37174,Homer,...the smallest nesting doll!
37187,Homer,there's always a catch.
37190,Homer,why you little! that's not a heartwarming thing to end on!
37192,Homer,"writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of dui's. the only reason tv exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human, made-up jobs."
37193,Homer,ooo! jail music!
37195,Homer,"no one feels out a unit like cj! not bubba, not debbie and danny, no one!"
37198,Homer,we're gonna get rich off the poor and forgetful! and dead people.
37203,Homer,feather boas?
37208,Homer,those are pretty cute...
37216,Homer,then how do you explain this?
37219,Homer,what's wrong?
37226,Homer,"heel? oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like grampa!"
37238,Homer,"now if you could make with some bacon and eggs, i'll be on my way."
37244,Homer,"yeah, it's medicinal. we had a pain in our neck."
37247,Homer,what about christian archie comics?
37250,Homer,your famous murmur. you know .
37260,Homer,"so, you went and hired a law firm, eh? that's pretty aggressive."
37264,Homer,"because if i hit you back, we'll be even. but if i don't hit you, that makes me the better man. and i'm liking the way that feels."
37265,Homer,"it's not for me to judge, ned because... i am the better man!"
37266,Homer,"better man, comin' through... way-better-better, way-better-better zing!"
37272,Homer,even after we came to school?
37288,Homer,you gotta be kiddin'.
37292,Homer,give up? it's marge -- i'm having a lunch date with my wife.
37295,Homer,"marge, this is amazing. i never realized some restaurants are better than others."
37296,Homer,oh yeah.
37298,Homer,what? what? you're interesting. why would you say that?
37303,Homer,"conversation, conversation... you look great."
37305,Homer,"you can't spell ""lousy"" without ""us."""
37306,Homer,"marge, wait!"
37307,Homer,"listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other."
37313,Homer,"i'm fightin' for ya, babe. fighting like i would for the last slice of cold pizza in the box. and to show you how serious i am..."
37314,Homer,from the place beside the gas station!
37316,Homer,"how do i win marge over? i could get her kids to like me! no, that ship has sailed."
37322,Homer,i can't please any woman.
37328,Homer,"i'd like a lot of food, and for this to be the last decision i have to make."
37333,Homer,wow. wow. this is the most delicious analogy i've ever eaten. i need to share this insight with marge. put this in your finest styrofoam!
37338,Homer,woo hoo! i'll woo her with woo-hoo!
37339,Homer,hello dere!
37348,Homer,what does that mean?
37350,Homer,"so, you forgive me?"
37352,Homer,which one?
37359,Homer,they charged a deposit!
37365,Homer,touché.
37372,Homer,"oh, now we're talkin'. but why me?"
37388,Homer,what the--?
37390,Homer,his boringness saved us all...
37395,Homer,"marge, you're deleting the two thousand nine oscar red carpet! there were some awesome dresses! and quite a few dis-as-ters."
37401,Homer,how deep is your love... how deep is your love...
37402,Homer,too on the nose. i really need to learn / 'cause we're living in a world of fools...
37406,Homer,"well, uh, i was just leaving, but moe... had an accident."
37416,Homer,get-- get get in there...
37418,Homer,"aw, dammit!"
37422,Homer,"those royal elephants have trainers to keep 'em in shape. average schmoe like me, forget it."
37423,Homer,sausage fingers!
37424,Homer,"okay guys, here's the deal -- i've gone bald."
37432,Homer,which one?
37435,Homer,"no, it's something else."
37446,Homer,"you did it, baby. you promised no fun and you delivered."
37453,Homer,"guys, i got big plans for these winnings. i'm going to build... a swimming pool."
37457,Homer,i wasn't thinking that! carl's our good friend.
37459,Homer,our money's gone.
37464,Homer,"come on, you know how dudes are. we don't go digging into the past. we talk about guy stuff."
37468,Homer,it's too small to read.
37470,Homer,fifty bucks per bag? i guess i'm only bringing one guitar on this revenge trip.
37471,Homer,baby... i'm going for us. that money is gonna dig us a swimming pool that'll take our broken family and make it whole.
37472,Homer,i've already taken care of that.
37473,Homer,"this is funny, it says here iceland is green, and greenland is icy. the vikings switched the names to trick everybody."
37478,Homer,the gates are locked.
37489,Homer,"well, we won't know that till after."
37490,Homer,but how can we learn to read ancient icelandic?
37494,Homer,"okay, let's see what this thing says."
37510,Homer,...keg-pools!
37525,Homer,you stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school!
37527,Homer,"hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it?"
37533,Homer,currently: zero.
37536,Homer,"um, marge, i have to go."
37537,Homer,all worth it for marge!
37538,Homer,i've been workin' on the railroad...
37554,Homer,honey... just what was going on with you and that guy?
37557,Homer,but when marge went boo hoo / i was building a choo-choo...
37564,Homer,swag! i'm gonna grab forever / stuff that i really don't need / swag!
37572,Homer,"i overslept, lost my cell phone, missed my flight."
37573,Homer,all the payphones at the airport were replaced by self-serve yogurt. i had all the cookie dough toppings a man could want.
37579,Homer,a napkin.
37585,Homer,"if you are a cat, prove it. do you hate mondays like garfield?"
37587,Homer,okay then.
37595,Homer,okay.
37605,Homer,you laugh now but you won't be laughing soon.
37606,Homer,how'd you get in here?
37615,Homer,"ow, this rug is hard on my knees. ow, this rug is hard on my knees. ow, this rug is hard on my knees."
37617,Homer,"aw, sweetie, you've told me a thousand things a million times. even with a brain the size of a dinosaur's, i couldn't take that in."
37627,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to make medical history!
37630,Homer,"hey boy, since you don't need a bedroom any more, i finally get my man cave."
37635,Homer,should've chopped off bart's head long ago.
37637,Homer,son-of-a!
37642,Homer,with an emerald that big i could buy anything -- a jalopy! an icebox! a steamer trunk full of fedoras! but how do i get my hands on it?
37645,Homer,"hey marge, you wanna marry moe?"
37659,Homer,"you killed burnsum? now who is gonna say ""step right up""?"
37669,Homer,you cost me a piece of all of that!
37676,Homer,that is a good fire.
37683,Homer,my boy's okay!
37686,Homer,what the?! if this kid's dad isn't here in one second he's going in the garbage can.
37698,Homer,eduardo?! is it really you? why are you here?
37701,Homer,"what happened to us, eduardo? we had so many things we were going to do."
37704,Homer,"did you just fart, sir."
37705,Homer,really? now? i have two pizzas coming. i wanted to see who would get here first.
37718,Homer,the editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend.
37721,Homer,i'm doing it! i'm flying like the squirrel i always knew i was.
37726,Homer,stupid tallest building in springfield!
37727,Homer,"son, it was so beautiful! i went faster than the speed of sound."
37745,Homer,the scene where she escapes with the cat at the end.
37748,Homer,"okay homer, remember your lamaze training..."
37750,Homer,"no, i didn't!"
37753,Homer,"it's a dude! and he's uncut! very euro! now, hug your mommy."
37755,Homer,"yeah, that guy didn't even look over once."
37772,Homer,"um, november."
37774,Homer,oh baby!
37779,Homer,"marge, it's not what you think!"
37786,Homer,and now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:
37790,Homer,"way ahead of you, marge. i am taking all four of my kids to the zoo tomorrow."
37792,Homer,i was talking about myself in the third person.
37795,Homer,"why you little... i'll give you a goodnight kiss you'll never forget! c'mere, you!"
37796,Homer,can i just say goodbye to him quick?
37804,Homer,woo hoo! who's chase?
37805,Homer,you didn't tell me he was a soldier.
37809,Homer,the most beautiful words a father can hear.
37816,Homer,"ooh, spaghetti."
37819,Homer,"all right, eighties party! where's the beef? tear down that wall! because i think the beef is behind that wall!"
37821,Homer,fine. you're mike singletary. enjoy your mediocre coaching career.
37823,Homer,why you little--
37829,Homer,"marge, i love bart as much as you do but actually not. and that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble. now if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, i'm going to moe's."
37834,Homer,"really? hey, i bet that submarine isn't so fun anyway."
37835,Homer,"as i always say, don't get mad, get dinner. then get even. with skinner."
37841,Homer,"just call me ""the cleaner."""
37845,Homer,"now, i'm afraid it's time to start your new life. you'll be hunted... on the run... searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you. so avoid mirrors."
37849,Homer,dick fiddler!
37872,Homer,"shut up, flanders!"
37876,Homer,"oh, boy. monday morning chit chat at the water cooler. the only reason to have done stuff over the weekend."
37887,Homer,"more snip, less lip."
37895,Homer,"wow, that was easy! all i had to do was click on--"
37903,Homer,"i live it, he writes it."
37912,Homer,"baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in!"
37915,Homer,whoever did this will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever!
37918,Homer,movie piracy.
37920,Homer,"i can't go back to jail! there's no shampoo, just soap!"
37921,Homer,"yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to ""taken"" where the ""hangover"" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is ""fast and furious."""
37923,Homer,"consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital."
37924,Homer,thank you so much for sticking with me through all this. you're the greatest wife in the world.
37928,Homer,all i ever had was you looking out for me. i've got nothin' now.
37932,Homer,"but when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what i believe in."
37936,Homer,you're pirating my movie?
37943,Homer,what?
37945,Homer,yes i have! after the oscars when he forces you!
37951,Homer,i will help you. as long as our bellies never touch again like they are right now.
37953,Homer,aka ni taishte burei da! yogore o yaburu!
37960,Homer,i get that a lot too.
37964,Homer,now that's disgusting. wine made of rice?
37965,Homer,why didn't i stop with the snake wine? why did i drink the fish wine?
37972,Homer,glasses! call lenny!
37975,Homer,i'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.
37978,Homer,"now, a simple sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown!"
37980,Homer,"springfield city hall was built for the spencer tracy movie ""meet me at city hall"". it was just a flat wall with nothing behind it for thirty years..."
37987,Homer,"squeeze here. rotate there. pause for sweet talk. oh glasses, you're so wonderful."
37994,Homer,"i'm really sorry, and..."
38005,Homer,monitors?!
38010,Homer,...someone's actually working...
38011,Homer,maggie?!
38017,Homer,mr. burns!
38022,Homer,not marmaduke! never marmaduke!
38023,Homer,"marmaduke was horrible today! also, marge is in therapy and she didn't even tell me!"
38024,Homer,"spied on her with a hidden camera. she thinks i'm selfish, she thinks i don't spend enough time with the kids..."
38030,Homer,"that's ""alias."" du-uh."
38034,Homer,"ow! where'd you learn to cut hair, idiot?"
38038,Homer,yeah. and?
38043,Homer,"wait, something's wrong. that's better."
38044,Homer,"sorry son, i only have twenties. and if god needs money, why doesn't he just write another bible? the first one sold pretty well."
38048,Homer,"right, right, too soon. do you have my money?"
38049,Homer,"seriously, do you have my money?"
38053,Homer,"pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, marge."
38054,Homer,quit pressuring me!
38056,Homer,"hey, you've said it twice, marge. you're in pretty deep."
38064,Homer,it's even better than i thought... you've found your moe szyslak! in just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of journey.
38075,Homer,"ooh, campus! do you have a statue of the founder i can stick a funny hat on?"
38081,Homer,it doesn't matter. i'm taking it pass-fail.
38090,Homer,how dare you torture my children with mozart!
38092,Homer,"if it's not final, who cares?"
38095,Homer,"my contract clearly promised ""barely livable""!"
38096,Homer,"oh... i guess grampa's coming home with us. unless... what about that nice dog boarding place? the really good one, where they each have their own dog ""partner."""
38098,Homer,"honey, grampa is the closest thing i have to a father and i love him. but three octogenocerouses?"
38101,Homer,"i mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!"
38110,Homer,"wow, never had breakfast at six in the morning before."
38112,Homer,oh my god! this counts as exercise? i'm barely moving and i'm smelling cinnebun. sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. i'm a seventy-nine-year-old man!
38118,Homer,falsies.
38119,Homer,oh my god! i know that kid! we've gotta help him!
38125,Homer,we've got ten minutes between the kids falling asleep and the old guys waking up.
38147,Homer,"baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right."
38150,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa..."
38153,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... split it with them?"
38155,Homer,this dude gets it.
38158,Homer,"i would feel: a). happy for their good fortune, b). proud to know rich people, and c). grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake."
38167,Homer,we had a deal. and now we've got nothing...
38168,Homer,"we were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it!"
38171,Homer,"oh, that was cold, luann. so cold! brrrrr! sarcastic brrrrrr!"
38176,Homer,don't worry. no one's gonna see this stupid show.
38179,Homer,"the paddles, marge! look at the paddles!"
38182,Homer,i guess i can't help but feel fully responsible.
38185,Homer,"not your fault, man. those parasailing guys take whatever they want."
38186,Homer,"okay, all i gotta do is take a quick ferry to isla verde, find café artiste, and they'll back up kirk's story. that will prove the painting was his -- and now ours."
38189,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah. just remember, if your mother asks, i took you to a wine tasting."
38194,Homer,i love art!
38197,Homer,oh... crap.
38202,Homer,while you're at it... could you make me a couple more?
38208,Homer,he makes me sick.
38211,Homer,'cause i'm a grade school hero / lisa never lies / i'm a grade school hero / and heroes never die / just one guitar! slung way down low / yeah one guitar! / where did my lawnmower go?!
38216,Homer,ooh!
38218,Homer,"of course i am, but how do you know?"
38227,Homer,what the?!
38229,Homer,"here you go, honey."
38232,Homer,thanks. i still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.
38235,Homer,get outta here!
38242,Homer,"oh my god. that's, that's shattering. and now, i'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since san francisco turned all nerdy."
38244,Homer,fine. marge is always complaining i never fix things. give me another.
38250,Homer,"well, if we're going to be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness."
38257,Homer,no penalty!
38266,Homer,hey! look at me! i'm going up a slide!
38272,Homer,"hey, guys! why are you ducked down like that?"
38274,Homer,competitive eater? did i hear right? i could be a competitive eater?
38276,Homer,then that makes me the jackie robinson of the sport. and you are the racist philadelphia manager!
38280,Homer,what the?
38290,Homer,"oh, it's ringing!"
38299,Homer,"hey, i can't screw this up or lisa will get stuck with someone like me."
38305,Homer,i mean for adults!
38306,Homer,no. i mean for adult males.
38307,Homer,"all right, i'll have the lasagna."
38308,Homer,"oh, uh. vegetarian. can the red sauce be cow blood?"
38309,Homer,"marge please, control your jealousy. this is your daughter!"
38311,Homer,a friend from high school.
38326,Homer,i'm back! comin' through!
38328,Homer,two weeks?
38329,Homer,wait a minute!
38330,Homer,yo. where's my body?
38336,Homer,"uh, marge? 'scuse me. uh, i think i need a reboot."
38338,Homer,"no, no, no! don't pull me out before you click eject! that hurts like a mother--"
38341,Homer,'bout time!
38347,Homer,"come on! hug your grampa, boys!"
38349,Homer,kids are so afraid of being terminated.
38357,Homer,"have a good day, you two! don't be me!"
38360,Homer,"hey, i created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that."
38362,Homer,flanders! can we borrow your spatula?!
38366,Homer,"wow. i've gotta take that in. while i do, have some bar nuts."
38371,Homer,"do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop."
38372,Homer,"well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it."
38377,Homer,"huh? maybe you're right, boy. it's time i was a better father. and i'll start by saving us. i just need to facilitate some horse intercourse."
38385,Homer,"you know, pregnant is pregnant..."
38393,Homer,"ah, young love."
38404,Homer,can i check out what toys they have?
38408,Homer,they'll get their blood money.
38411,Homer,why you--
38413,Homer,"uh, nice night for a walk."
38414,Homer,do you want to be more alone?
38427,Homer,yeah. nothin-- nothing's going on.
38445,Homer,"giuseppe, i want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career."
38450,Homer,can i pitch something?
38454,Homer,"no, you're a-wrong!"
38463,Homer,out of my reach? must... make... effort...
38468,Homer,huh? oh.
38471,Homer,but...
38476,Homer,me neither.
38477,Homer,brief nudityyy!
38478,Homer,i thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.
38480,Homer,i know how cereal works. now clean your room.
38482,Homer,that better not mean what it means when i say it.
38484,Homer,you poor woman. dealing with bart has turned your mind to ketchup water. you rest. i'll be the boy's father now.
38496,Homer,"c'mon, lick it!"
38513,Homer,are you crazy? we'll never make it! drop the anchor and wait out the storm!
38514,Homer,i'm dropping the anchor!
38519,Homer,i got a bad sunburn and i was crapped on by a seagull / i don't see any lifeboats and i don't think that is legal
38524,Homer,turn right here. i keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power.
38527,Homer,it's all gonna thaw!
38530,Homer,"aw, somebody wants more crusts. here you go, boy!"
38535,Homer,familyicious.
38542,Homer,"i love you, marjorie. and i've had my share of failures, sure. and sometimes i get pretty nervous. but thanks for talking it out with me. i think i can finally get to sleep now."
38544,Homer,"no, no, i'd like to see the manager."
38546,Homer,"hey, tony roma's wasn't built in a day. but don't worry. i told everyone about this place and they're all going to support you. you do have drone delivery, right? i kinda promised that."
38550,Homer,hillbillies!
38553,Homer,whew!
38555,Homer,i'm a litigious business man and i need a coffee to go.
38560,Homer,what?
38574,Homer,"all right, show yourselves in the name of this book!"
38580,Homer,i can't believe you wasted our money on fruit.
38594,Homer,"hm, oh honey, one teensy problem with this plan. i'm a teensy bit concerned about them smoking around the children. you know, their lungs are so teensy."
38595,Homer,"and if you trust them, i trust them too."
38598,Homer,"if you fall asleep with them, will you even burn to death?"
38600,Homer,you can't resist smoking in the house any more than i can resist drinking in the car.
38603,Homer,lisa! motorcade!
38605,Homer,"woo-hoo? i don't know... ""fracking"" is one of those scary lisa words."
38609,Homer,and all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what you're selling: beer.
38616,Homer,high-quality methamphetamines.
38619,Homer,"good, judge away."
38628,Homer,marge simpson... i'm as mad at you as you usually are at me.
38633,Homer,so you don't miss that politics lady at all?
38657,Homer,you future guys have a word for everything... pal.
38661,Homer,you don't have to announce it. just do it quietly and blame the dog.
38666,Homer,and that's why i owe clash of candies twenty thousand dollars. here we are.
38668,Homer,start with flanders... start with flanders...
38674,Homer,ha! february has no twenty-third!
38677,Homer,what the?
38680,Homer,"simpsons, in the / future -- space jokes! / flying through town / what are those tubes / i wonder what / ice cream's like now / maybe it's hot / or some new temperature they invented... that's it, we're done."
38681,Homer,you wanna talk about it?
38689,Homer,you're right. no one could be expected to remember something from a year ago. certainly not me. pass the gravy?
38704,Homer,"you know, alarm code three six seven nine. three six seven nine!"
38708,Homer,a place that's filled with sun and sand / a desert steampunk disneyland / keep expectations lowww... / swing low sweet chariot...
38709,Homer,"homer simpson, i love you."
38710,Homer,cars shaped like cupcakes!
38713,Homer,"hey man, can i bum a tent?"
38716,Homer,"aw, let me get a picture of that."
38731,Homer,i'm not set at all.
38735,Homer,sure it is. you know i've always loved laying things down. grooves are just the latest.
38736,Homer,"i feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players. like what's his name from the who. or that guy from led zeppelin who wasn't page, plant or bonham. those are the only two i know for sure."
38738,Homer,so easy.
38739,Homer,i don't know guys. i'm not sure i'm feeling this. the bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument.
38760,Homer,"apu has a rich life here in springfield: a store full of great products, a lovely him-type wife, and eight super kids: anoop, sandeep, nabendu, gheet, pria, uma, poonam, sashi--"
38762,Homer,i want his fame and fortune so much! why must the lords of rock be so cruel?!
38765,Homer,i'm not jealous. i'm envious. jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. envy is wanting what someone else has. what i feel is envy.
38773,Homer,"well it's not enough anymore. when something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse. look it up, it's called physics."
38774,Homer,"oh, you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star?"
38779,Homer,let's see how he performs in front of all those people without his magic-people-performing-in-front-of shirt.
38785,Homer,mr. scrooge!
38794,Homer,"hey, what the--"
38799,Homer,"moe, what are you doing?"
38802,Homer,gimme another one.
38803,Homer,gimme another one.
38808,Homer,"yeah, but doesn't the money go to schools?"
38815,Homer,even the anchor store's closed.
38817,Homer,i guess i'll take the concentration camp one.
38821,Homer,"say flanders, with all the hard luck you've had, how do you stay so happy? and don't say ""jesus."""
38826,Homer,"you're all right, stupid flanders. you're all right."
38827,Homer,i made everyone happy but me. some christmas. feliz navidad.
38828,Homer,what the?
38829,Homer,the nutcracker! every child's favorite christmas character! is this a dream?
38832,Homer,oh my god. is that girl really doing that?
38833,Homer,"mmm, load-bearing wall."
38834,Homer,woo hoo!
38837,Homer,"oh marge, you found me! you always find me. now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot."
38840,Homer,you have all taught me a christmas message i'll never forget: the place to get drunk is at home.
38841,Homer,what the? this isn't halloween!
38857,Homer,uh-oh.
38871,Homer,come on... come on... you son of a--
38872,Homer,"yeah, you really went with the purple theme."
38883,Homer,"that kid's got talent, but c'mon!"
38892,Homer,"...but perhaps earth's greatest achievement is moon rocks. oh, and the golden age of radio."
38899,Homer,you forgot to glaze me!
38915,Homer,"and marge, i've got this weird new feeling in my stomach. a little sour and a little sick."
38918,Homer,"yes, sir. yes, sir. can i get a four fifty-five wakeup call?"
38920,Homer,"no. marge, if i lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. oh, i guess, as a fallback, i could direct films like angelina jolie. how many properties do we have an option on?"
38924,Homer,"okay, marge. we can go to the circus. maybe i can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion."
38925,Homer,dammit! this circus wi-fi is a joke!
38928,Homer,the early bird gets the shaft!
38936,Homer,"hey, is that time right? i have a deadline in an hour and a half!"
38937,Homer,okay.
38938,Homer,"ooh, patter!"
38947,Homer,"i know you are but what am i, infinity plus one! jinx!"
38951,Homer,oops.
38967,Homer,why you little--
38973,Homer,wanna see me make a muscle?
38975,Homer,okay.
38980,Homer,woo hoo!

38986,Homer,what the? lasagna in bed?!
38990,Homer,"what do you say, boy? wanna split the lasagna?"
39000,Homer,you-- get-- out!
39010,Homer,die!
39036,Homer,since you came down from the sky
39039,Homer,more of what?
39047,Homer,it's on your face too!
39048,Homer,"well, i've saved you one last prize from the cracker jack box that is my brain. use it as you will."
39052,Homer,the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet... wearing a helmet... wearing a helmet..
39053,Homer,i met a guy. a wonderful guy.
39054,Homer,boy. sure is nice not to be the one on the horse for a change.
39055,Homer,simpler time.
39057,Homer,artists.
39066,Homer,dammit!
39072,Homer,hmmm.

39107,Homer,"thanks, lady."
39109,Homer,"twenty-three?! people, for god's sake, join a gym."
39110,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry i was proud of myself."
39115,Homer,marge! stop that crazy thing!
39117,Homer,"moe, quick! beer me before i answer the phone!"
39122,Homer,hey moe... i'll take care of the bar. you did me a favor today.
39123,Homer,"man, moe's barely got two nickels to rub together."
39125,Homer,we don't look at you that way.
39126,Homer,good ol' dae ho. used to give me the pickles off his sandwich. and all i had to do was let him copy some keys.
39134,Homer,"well, you know people can kinda act like they're in grade school."
39142,Homer,"oh, uh, i will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal, using my greatest skill -- lunchroom trading. shut your eyes."
39145,Homer,"princess, why did you put on that coat? you're obviously cold. may i escort you to the radiator?"
39151,Homer,"all right, princess. i'll take you to a place that's fun with a capital f."
39162,Homer,"um, yeah, sure. hello, this is the princess. i'm with homer simpson and i do declare he's wonderful. oh, that's right, i'm from south africa. fiddle dee dee."
39167,Homer,"and the older one, i can't tell her what to do. and she's only twelve."
39169,Homer,but the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them...
39172,Homer,"oh, god gets your prayers, but he just clicks delete without reading them, like email updates from linkedin."
39183,Homer,"cats and dogs, squabble's never ending / even with so much legislation pending!"
39191,Homer,stole? how is counting cards stealing?
39196,Homer,no! an injustice has gone on here for too long.
39199,Homer,there's no time to be careful.
39201,Homer,"hey, norman. how's it going? so you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. how ya doing, fred? excuse me, fred."
39205,Homer,who shall i say is calling?
39206,Homer,it's your sister.

39252,Homer,"oh, i knew that one, too."
39256,Homer,and why is that?
39259,Homer,uh-oh.
39264,Homer,"what's your name, bart... ner? -- er -- little partner?"
39267,Homer,"nobody knows. it's a secret. i didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on christmas, i'd do anything."
39277,Homer,but... but...
39289,Homer,what are the odds on santa's little helper?
39293,Homer,that's my boy. everything on santa's little helper.
39297,Homer,"come on, boy."
39302,Homer,but he's a loser. he's pathetic. he's...
39312,Homer,"oh, wait! here's a good one -- ""do""."
39320,Homer,"what have you done this time, boy?"
39325,Homer,what do we need a psychiatrist for? we know our kid is nuts.
39330,Homer,"come on, bart, your mother's only trying to help. so go ahead and enjoy the show."
39333,Homer,"sorry, boy."
39341,Homer,"so, how was it?"
39342,Homer,what?
39356,Homer,"oh, you don't think so, eh? well, here comes some real heat."
39359,Homer,"don't be discouraged, son. i bet einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the light bulb."
39365,Homer,"but -- son, if you don't come out i can't ""hug"" you... and ""kiss you""... and make you feel all better."
39366,Homer,nothin's easy.
39370,Homer,"oh, hi, boy!"
39374,Homer,"you're right! i'm young, i'm able-bodied, and i'll take anything. watch out, springfield, here i come."
39380,Homer,i'm fine. i'm just thinking.
39391,Homer,"well, live and learn."
39394,Homer,wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley
39397,Homer,wow. they listened to me.
39400,Homer,"ah, what a great family! but come on, we all know this is small potatoes. there is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together."
39408,Homer,"stay here, i'll be right back."
39421,Homer,"friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. you have to learn that there's a little homer simpson in all of us."
39434,Homer,"simpson, homer."
39437,Homer,"no, heh, heh, heh. just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man."
39439,Homer,be normal! be normal!
39444,Homer,marge! knock it off!
39449,Homer,"snap out of it, marge. you've got to come with me--the boss is going to make a toast!"
39460,Homer,no. we're going to say grace first.
39464,Homer,"you think so, huh? well, there's only one way to find out. follow me."
39475,Homer,"you can't talk that way about my kids. or, at least two of them."
39476,Homer,"why, you... here's five you haven't met."
39480,Homer,"now, look, you know and i know this family needs help. professional help. so i made us an appointment with dr. marvin monroe."
39482,Homer,"honey, i've given this matter a lot of study. and of all the commercials i saw, his was the best. all it costs is two hundred and fifty dollars."
39483,Homer,"well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. marge, go get the kids' college fund."
39484,Homer,"oh, come on, marge. why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?"
39487,Homer,"now, i appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here."
39490,Homer,"hey, no pain, no gain."
39492,Homer,bart!
39495,Homer,good idea.
39500,Homer,"oh, yes, doctor."
39502,Homer,arrrgh!
39504,Homer,"wait a minute, doc! your tv commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!"
39506,Homer,that piece of junk? forget it! we're going to get a new tv! twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
39514,Homer,"yeah, right, lis. it's the three roads to success, bart. work, brains, and..."
39515,Homer,"yeah, and i got the day off from work."
39516,Homer,"but what's a day off from work when i'm never gonna see my beloved son again. oh, bart. oh, bart."
39517,Homer,"tough day at school, boy?"
39520,Homer,"come on, bart, we don't want your mother to see you crying. here, let me help you dry those tears."
39521,Homer,"so, what's the problem, son?"
39530,Homer,"see, that boy? you didn't expect that, did you? and neither will he."
39532,Homer,"so the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded..."
39537,Homer,"what about you, boy?"
39552,Homer,"get out of the way! how come he's not ducking? ugh! wait a minute, i can't get my... get out of the way, stupid!"
39556,Homer,"""lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad."" well, she doesn't look sad. i don't see any tears in her eyes."
39559,Homer,"come on, lisa... ride the homer horsey. giddiyap! whee!"
39565,Homer,i am not. it's just that i couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. lisa! lisa!
39567,Homer,"lisa, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to yell. go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy."
39574,Homer,"oh, so that's it. this is some kind of underwear thing."
39576,Homer,"marge, are you all right?"
39579,Homer,bart!
39584,Homer,listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do?
39588,Homer,excuse me. i think i hear my wife calling.
39598,Homer,what?
39599,Homer,"just be happy with what you got, son. don't try to keep up with the flanderses."
39601,Homer,a satellite dish!
39635,Homer,"okay, nobody move. nobody panic. when i give the word, everyone ever so slowly open your door and slide out. on the count of three. one..."
39646,Homer,"that's nice, lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. we're in the woods."
39656,Homer,what the--? you're alive!... and... buck nekkid.
39659,Homer,"okay, slap a fern on there, boy. now, some mud. there. ooh! that requires a little mollusk. and mollusk for me. all right. we're ready to hit the town."
39660,Homer,"ah food. good thinking, son."
39667,Homer,"g-g-good night, s-son. s-sleep tight."
39669,Homer,how would i know. quit asking pointless... bart look!
39672,Homer,wah-neh! wah-neh!
39674,Homer,pleehhh! hnnnn! plem! feh!
39676,Homer,plemk heh feh.
39685,Homer,"ooh, those stupid eggheads."
39695,Homer,"but you don't understand, marge. i have fifty bucks riding on this game."
39702,Homer,lazar who?
39704,Homer,maybe.
39709,Homer,what? oh yeah. you were great.
39711,Homer,"oh! he didn't by any chance say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he?"
39712,Homer,what! those cute little monkeys? that's terrible. who told you that?
39724,Homer,"oooh. look at this one. ""the hammer of thor. it will send your pins to valhalla."" lisa?"
39737,Homer,"of course i know! sure! you really thought i forgot, didn't you?"
39745,Homer,hmmmm!
39749,Homer,"what's that, patty?"
39751,Homer,hold on! hold on now! your mother hasn't opened my present yet.
39754,Homer,"you always say we should talk. i'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. but i'm going to stop in a second. so, please say something back, marge, please. i'm gonna stop talking... now."
39759,Homer,what? but you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.
39761,Homer,"now this is living, eh, kids? hot pizza... the food of kings."
39763,Homer,"okay. we've eaten, and eaten well. now, what else do we have to do? well, let's check the list your mom left us."
39778,Homer,hmm. good advice.
39784,Homer,"what a lovely surprise! you're here to see me, right?"
39786,Homer,"oh, it was delightful. the frosting on the cake was this thick. and eugene fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. and he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in valve maintenance."
39788,Homer,"just keepin' you on your toes, babe."
39791,Homer,"good idea, marge. by the way, this friday night i'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. eugene fisk is marrying some girl in valve maintenance."
39801,Homer,"oh, this is the most fun i've had in my whole life."
39808,Homer,"i hear ya, buddy! whew! full moon!"
39818,Homer,"oh, moe. my wife gave me the old heave-ho because of some lousy picture."
39822,Homer,"don't listen to him, marge, he's..."
39823,Homer,"no, barn. i just want to crawl into bed."
39831,Homer,how's your mom?
39834,Homer,are you still mad?... you are still mad. no need to say it. i'm your loving husband. i can read you like a book. i'll just have some milk.
39844,Homer,oooo.
39855,Homer,marge!
39856,Homer,"jeez, louise. look at this mess."
39860,Homer,"oh, maggie. my poor back."
39863,Homer,"actually, i was wondering if you could make me a grilled cheese sandwich?"
39864,Homer,make sure it's squished flat and crunchy on the outside.
39868,Homer,that old gag.
39873,Homer,you mean all white with pink eyes?
39874,Homer,he makes me crazy twelve months a year. at least you get the summer off.
39878,Homer,be good.
39880,Homer,give me the old stars and stripes.
39883,Homer,"please, please kids. stop fighting. maybe lisa's right about america being a land of opportunity, and maybe adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers."
39888,Homer,"look, adil. you can call me dad."
39899,Homer,you little shutterbug.
39907,Homer,"ooh, trouble in the neighborhood. let's check it out."
39911,Homer,aw!
39919,Homer,"sorry, marge. some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle."
39924,Homer,"mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... new flavor! triple chocolate!"
39936,Homer,i'm home everybody.
39941,Homer,earth to marge. earth to marge. i was there... the clown's g-i-l-l -t-y.
39942,Homer,"sorry, son. you'll understand one day."
39946,Homer,"no, i'm not. i'm hopping on the bandwagon. now come on, son, get with the winning team."

39995,Homer,whoa!

40003,Homer,"oh, these things are heavy."
40019,Homer,look at those funny little whiskers. oooo! that reminds me. it's big gorilla week on million dollar movie. c'mon boy.
40021,Homer,it's so unfair... just because he's different.
40025,Homer,what?
40026,Homer,i wish i had amoria phlebitis.
40028,Homer,"hey, dr. j."
40045,Homer,"marge, weren't you listening? this is a miracle breakthrough. not one of these cheapo sucker deals."
40052,Homer,"if i had hair, you wouldn't be calling me that."
40058,Homer,"good morning, moe's tavern!"
40065,Homer,hello?

40093,Homer,yea... eh... how about a pony?
40110,Homer,what do you mean?
40111,Homer,"no, i can't. i'm just a big fool."
40113,Homer,karl.
40118,Homer,i don't know... a hundred and two?
40119,Homer,"what! oh thank you, thank you, thank you."
40133,Homer,so we got a good deal for once. quit fighting it.
40141,Homer,"now wait a minute, marge. it's only natural there would be some things wrong with an old house like this. it's a fixer-upper. what's the problem? we get a bunch of priests in here..."
40150,Homer,"mr. ploot? homer simpson here. when you sold me this house you forgot to mention one little thing. you didn't tell me it was built on an indian burial ground. no you didn't! well, that's not my recollection... yeah! well... all right, goodbye. he says he mentioned it five or six times."
40151,Homer,"aw, gee, marge."
40155,Homer,"oooo! that was a big mama. heh, heh, heh."
40172,Homer,"oh, lenore."
40186,Homer,"take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
40190,Homer,"oh... oh, i hate halloween."
40192,Homer,like getting washington's birthday and lincoln's birthday back as separate paid holidays. president's day! pfft. what a rip-off! i bust my butt day in and day out --
40199,Homer,"echo, echo..."
40200,Homer,"huh? what th... uh, mr. burns?"
40204,Homer,"well, nobody's perfect."
40207,Homer,"uh... don't get me wrong. i mean you're an honest man. i just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'course i'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. i mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't."
40209,Homer,"if it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?"
40210,Homer,"well, he's got my vote."
40211,Homer,mary bailey isn't going to fire me if i don't vote for her. i'm for monty burns.
40215,Homer,"not yet, son. not yet."
40220,Homer,"please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
40226,Homer,huh?
40227,Homer,"hey! hello, handsome!"
40230,Homer,"bart, would you like to say grace?"
40232,Homer,i was only reading what the card...
40233,Homer,"uh, mr. burns... uh, mr. burns..."
40234,Homer,"oh. my dreams will go unfulfilled! oh no. i don't like the sound of that one bit. that means i have nothing to hope for. marge, make it better. please. can't you make it better, huh?"
40239,Homer,"you know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day."
40242,Homer,what are you getting at?
40246,Homer,"what's the matter, boy?"
40249,Homer,hey everybody! how you doin'? look at me! i'm homer simpson! heh...heh.
40258,Homer,"ohhh. well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe i'm all turned around on the subject. wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?"
40262,Homer,don't mind if i do.
40266,Homer,your team needs you! c'mon!!!
40267,Homer,"as i got up in front of them, i felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. it was the intoxication of being a public spectacle."
40271,Homer,"well, i'm ready to punch in."
40283,Homer,this was the biggest decision the simpsons ever faced. i should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.
40296,Homer,wow! that's service!
40297,Homer,the duff brewery!
40312,Homer,it was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.
40319,Homer,bust my hump all week... stupid grass... supposed to be the boy's job.
40320,Homer,"h'lo, flanders."
40329,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, flanders?"
40334,Homer,one for the road.
40342,Homer,i'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. i got a little excited. i'm not perfect... like ned flanders.
40353,Homer,"i know, i know. i can still make this for five. come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. pleeze."
40365,Homer,"what're you doing? that putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player, what a violin is to the guy tha...the violin guy. now, c'mon, give your putter a name."
40366,Homer,"come on, give it a name."
40372,Homer,and?
40375,Homer,i said now!
40390,Homer,"marge, give me your honest opinion. this? or this?"
40391,Homer,"good morning, son! oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!"
40404,Homer,"ohhh, so you're gonna welch on our bet?!"
40413,Homer,heh... heh... heh. bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.
40415,Homer,underdog! don't you know anything?
40424,Homer,"oh, well, i'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it. let's go."
40426,Homer,the hell with this.
40428,Homer,"speaking of heroes, here's mine... tom turkey!"
40429,Homer,"all right, bart that's it! go to your room now!"
40430,Homer,"...and, lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. you saw what happened. oh, lord, be honest. are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?"
40434,Homer,"yes, dad."
40437,Homer,"hello, operator? gimme the number for 911!"
40439,Homer,"well uh, we did kinda yell at him... and sent him to his room... and tried to force him to apologize to his sister."
40447,Homer,"oh lord, on this blessed day, we thank thee for giving our family one more crack at togetherness. amen."
40456,Homer,"marge, you're a genius."
40461,Homer,"thanks, flanders. big know-it-all."
40466,Homer,"where, where?"
40467,Homer,"let the destruction begin! hey, they forgot my corn dog."
40470,Homer,"bart, bart. we're home, son."
40471,Homer,kids say such stupid things.
40489,Homer,"you know, marge, we got a pretty good kid there."
40492,Homer,bart!
40501,Homer,"you know, marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world."
40502,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna build you a spice rack!"
40515,Homer,"heh, heh, heh."
40518,Homer,"everybody's looking at us, marge."
40524,Homer,"you know, some of these stories are pretty good. i never know mice lived such interesting lives."
40533,Homer,"well, i always knew you'd change the world, for the better."
40535,Homer,really? great!
40540,Homer,he's awake!
40544,Homer,wow...
40562,Homer,"oh, what? what is it?"
40565,Homer,you mean duke it out?
40584,Homer,"i'm saying... she's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. i'm not sure i love you anymore."
40588,Homer,"sorry to scare you like that, babe."
40598,Homer,fine. we'll go to mars.
40600,Homer,"if i said no the first time, what makes you think i'm gonna say yes the second time?"
40614,Homer,"... oh, oh, and two of these things."
40620,Homer,mmmm. fan-fugu-tastic.
40621,Homer,"beautiful language, isn't it, marge?"
40630,Homer,why you little --
40632,Homer,"doc, you gotta get me out of this. i'll make it worth your while."
40636,Homer,"hello, marge? hello? i'm the one who's dying, not you."
40639,Homer,"i'm not done yet, marge. what's that word you use for when you and i... you know..."
40642,Homer,"till six a.m., my dearest darling and my last day on earth."
40644,Homer,"marge, why did you let me sleep so late?"
40645,Homer,there'll be plenty of time for that! i've got tons of important stuff to do.
40655,Homer,"oh, that's my boy."
40659,Homer,"yeah, that's more like it! ""oh, i want to be in that rumba / when the saints go over there.... over there... over there."""
40663,Homer,"no, i don't want-a..."
40669,Homer,dad --
40680,Homer,"oh, i really wanted to do that one."
40681,Homer,"gee, dad. way to hog my last moments."
40682,Homer,"yeah, yeah. the old guy's a little love-starved."
40685,Homer,that's sorta nice. what are you in for?
40687,Homer,damn those novelty telephone answering machine tapes!
40703,Homer,love you. love you. love you.
40707,Homer,"goodbye, maggie -- stay as sweet as you are."
40708,Homer,"goodbye, lisa -- i know you'll make me proud."
40719,Homer,i love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
40734,Homer,i... i don't know!
40738,Homer,i haven't seen you in school before.
40758,Homer,"me, in a nuclear power plant... kaboom!"
40762,Homer,"fifty-five! that's ridiculous! sure, they'll save a few lives. but millions will be late!"
40770,Homer,with pleasure.
40772,Homer,"oh, you may not remember me. i'm homer simpson. i mooned for rebuttal."
40775,Homer,"look, i'm not asking you to like me, i'm not asking you to put yourself in a position where i can touch your goodies, i'm just asking you to be fair."
40780,Homer,"yeah, so...."
40781,Homer,you tutor?
40789,Homer,cray-on.
40790,Homer,fenetre.
40792,Homer,"oh.... wait, don't go. don't go. wait, wait -- why don't we take a little study break?"
40799,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, marge. if honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. i'm not really in any french class. this was just a brilliant scheme to get to know you better."
40816,Homer,"because i'm sure we were meant to be together. usually when i have a thought there's a lot of other thoughts in there. something says yes, something says no. but this time there's only yes. how could the only thing i've ever been sure about in my life be wrong?"
40819,Homer,shut up. i'm over as far as i can go!
40820,Homer,"all right, all right! i'll walk in the mud!"
40826,Homer,and i never have.
40831,Homer,"hey, stop, cable man! stop!"
40834,Homer,so you've decided to steal cable.
40835,Homer,"""myth: cable piracy is wrong. fact: cable companies are big faceless corporations, which makes it okay."""
40837,Homer,it's funny 'cause it's true!
40840,Homer,"nothing a month? yeah, i think we can swing that."
40842,Homer,marge --
40844,Homer,"oooo. pro wrestling from mexico. you know, down there it's a real sport."
40845,Homer,they must think people will watch anything.
40854,Homer,"well, duh."
40861,Homer,how can one little insulated wire bring so much happiness?
40866,Homer,"oh, too bad. it's gonna be a great fight."
40867,Homer,bart!
40868,Homer,"son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. it's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. i want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again."
40869,Homer,promise me.
40870,Homer,good boy.
40871,Homer,hey lisa -- racing from belmont? horsies!
40872,Homer,"there is something wrong with that kid. she's so moral. why can't she be more like... well, not like bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium."
40873,Homer,unhook it?! but i love cable.
40883,Homer,"marge, we can't be too careful. there are thieves everywhere, and i'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff."
40884,Homer,huh? what the? i know you -- come back here...
40886,Homer,oh great.
40895,Homer,will you quit staring at me like that!
40905,Homer,the greatest fight ever and i missed it.
40906,Homer,"cable clippers, please."
40910,Homer,this is like some beautiful dream.
40912,Homer,"marge, i'm only human. now look, here's what we're gonna do. we'll unload the kids on patty and selma saturday night. and then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. just like old times."
40924,Homer,must find man. must find man. must find man.
40927,Homer,sorry.
40929,Homer,"but enough about bart. tell me, principal skinner, are you married?"
40931,Homer,"oh, no reason, really. i was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. a payback for all the crummy things bart has done to your school."
40937,Homer,like my wife's ugly sister.
40940,Homer,"oh, there's the little prom queen now."
40948,Homer,the hospital? y'ello... oh my god!
40958,Homer,"excuse me, is this an orphanage?"
40964,Homer,"i know, he could be anywhere! that's why i want you to narrow it down! please..."
40966,Homer,"oh, oh... i get it. okay. here's twenty bucks. now will you tell me where my brother lives?"
40967,Homer,just take it and tell me!
40975,Homer,from the shelbyville orphanage?
40978,Homer,"oh, sorry."
40988,Homer,holy moly! the bastard's rich!
41006,Homer,and i want to let you!!
41012,Homer,"oh, okay."
41019,Homer,because you think i'm dynamic?
41022,Homer,"ah, unky herb, i don't know anything about cars."
41024,Homer,what?
41025,Homer,sort of!
41028,Homer,and i'm not done yet. you know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? that should be on every car.
41041,Homer,"thanks, boy. i was waiting for someone to say that."
41049,Homer,"are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? i am going to explain this to you one more time, and then i am going to hang up on you. it is not my dog. i tied my dog outside myself. i am looking at him right --"
41053,Homer,oooh! oooh! how much? how much? how much?
41057,Homer,"oh man, two dollars. uh, i'll take these three... they're for my daughter."
41067,Homer,i've changed my mind. i decided i don't want these shoes.
41077,Homer,this is not happening! this is not happening!
41083,Homer,no.
41091,Homer,"my god, you're right, marge. you kids wouldn't put me in a home like i did to my dad, would you?"
41108,Homer,oh no! dad's lost his hearing.
41111,Homer,"oh dad. oh, i knew you'd forgive me."
41112,Homer,i miss my daddy.
41129,Homer,"dad, no! gimme that."
41130,Homer,gimme me that money. ow! you're hurting me.
41133,Homer,yes!!!
41134,Homer,"heads up, kids. i'm moving the seat back."
41138,Homer,oh no! urg... arrrgh. c'mon you stupid tube!!!
41144,Homer,"marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bone."
41147,Homer,"this old attic's kinda spooky, isn't it boy. i said, isn't it, boy?"
41157,Homer,"well, wait a minute. hey, i've been setting my drinks on these things."
41163,Homer,"i can't move, boy."
41169,Homer,"oh, isn't that wonderful. my work and my home life come together in such a nice way. marge, may i see you in the other room?"
41170,Homer,"honey, he's nuts. he thinks he's handsome. please, make him look handsome. please, please, please, please..."
41173,Homer,all right! woo woo! woo woo!
41176,Homer,no. burns is right. what's the use?
41186,Homer,"woo woo! all right! i always knew you had personality. the doctors said it was hyperactivity, but i knew better. president simpson. has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?"
41189,Homer,"tomorrow... ugh; oh, marge, i'd love to, but i was planning on... sleeping... eating a big sandwich... watching t.v... spending some time with the boy. spending time with the boy. the boy needs attention, marge."
41210,Homer,"hey, moses, keep 'em comin'."
41216,Homer,"come on, family. let's go celebrate our new found ability to express love for each other. i'm taking you out for frosty chocolate milkshakes!"
41217,Homer,mmm... bacon.
41218,Homer,now how about a hug?
41224,Homer,donald trump? no. arnold palmer? no. bill cosby? no.
41225,Homer,bravo!
41227,Homer,i want some peanuts.
41241,Homer,why is mr. burns being so nice to me?
41244,Homer,yikes!
41246,Homer,"this is it, homer. it's time to tell her the terrible secret from your past."
41251,Homer,wait. are you sure that's how this sort of thing works?
41255,Homer,"something was said: not good. what was it? ""don't yell at homer."" no, that's okay. what was it? ""slow."" they called you ""slow!"""
41256,Homer,something said: not good...
41257,Homer,eatthepuddingeatthepudding eatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthe pudding.
41260,Homer,quiet! it might be you. i can't remember.
41262,Homer,"i've worked here for ten years, and my boss doesn't even know my name? well, that's gonna change right now. my name is homer j. simp--"
41269,Homer,that cactus is right. i've only got one chance. i got to knock him out.
41270,Homer,"you can stay, but i'm leaving."
41274,Homer,you're leaving the arm there too long! you wanna make it worse?!
41280,Homer,no! must resist temptation!
41300,Homer,"uh-oh. she's picked names? who puts this much thought into having a baby? stall, stall, stall!"
41311,Homer,"ooh, these cotton-poly blends are sooo comfortable!"
41313,Homer,dammit!
41319,Homer,holy macaroni!
41324,Homer,"greetings, friend..."
41330,Homer,"wow, i do look pretty calm down there."
41338,Homer,wow. bart has feelings. mrs. doody.
41341,Homer,now for that happy period between the lie and the time it's found out.
41345,Homer,"uh-oh! i'm gonna have to work on my marriage. or, alternatively..."
41348,Homer,"oh man, what do i do? wait -- the book marge gave me!"
41350,Homer,"it's poison! whatever you do, don't eat it."
41355,Homer,"wait... if i tell marge i won, she'll know i was buying the ticket when i was supposed to be onstage with her. i'm rich and i can't even tell my own wife!"
41362,Homer,"she is flirting with me. okay, homer, let her down easy. don't go breaking any hearts."
41365,Homer,"oh my god, marge is here! what is she thinking now?"
41368,Homer,don't eat it. it's been in the boy's ear and the dog's mouth. don't eat it.
41370,Homer,wednesday?
41371,Homer,"okay, she's always in a good mood after therapy..."
41374,Homer,especially this time...

41399,Homer,fun! fun! fun! fun! fun! fun! fun! fun!
41414,Homer,nothin's gonna ruin this one.
41417,Homer,hey! a little respect!
41420,Homer,i'll crack you!
41424,Homer,it was that golden weekend between summer school and regular school...
41425,Homer,young me? what brings you to the present?
41427,Homer,no.
41435,Homer,now i'm gonna have to look at that every morning.
41442,Homer,"see what your monkeyshines have done, boy?!"
41443,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to make fun of my socks...
41445,Homer,fourteen... fifteen... sixteen! woo-hoo!
41446,Homer,"oh, i don't feel so good."
41451,Homer,"stay with me, marge, and i promise we'll travel the world... and perhaps outer space."
41455,Homer,my fellow wildcats... my name is homer simpson. there are many reasons why i... uh... i... i... you know what?
41456,Homer,"i spent all night working on that speech, but now i realize the best thing to do is speak from my heart."
41463,Homer,"oh, hair. i'll love you when you're old and gray."
41464,Homer,"huh... well, two can play at that game!"
41465,Homer,who are you?
41466,Homer,why you little...
41469,Homer,you're lookin' at him.
41472,Homer,shut up and go to the prom with me!
41475,Homer,...unnecessarily big tvs?!
41477,Homer,"okay, that's not so great."
41487,Homer,i put you in a rabbit cage! i poked your flab back in! square by square!
41489,Homer,daddy! daddy!
41494,Homer,spooky. hm... hm...
41495,Homer,it's great! i haven't been this skinny since high school.
41497,Homer,"hmmm... hey, something's blocking it."
41501,Homer,zookeeper! zookeeper! those two monkeys are killing each other!
41504,Homer,take out wrenched ankle.
41524,Homer,"well, i aims to please. hey, let's stop by that dumpster and make out. hold that thought."
41532,Homer,none of your business. now give me a job at your business.
41537,Homer,"professor august, eh? who is he, some grey-haired old bookworm?"
41539,Homer,hm... i wonder what's on your mind...
41553,Homer,marge!
41555,Homer,now why would i be angry and bitter? because i'm paying for you to make goo-goo eyes at some smooth-talking professor?
41572,Homer,of course. the thing that stood between us -- the nineties -- is almost over.
41576,Homer,"creepy. you can have mine, bongo."
41577,Homer,little homer had a dog / and bongo was his name-o / b-o-on-on-go / b-o-on-on-go...
41582,Homer,what?! no! no! no! bongo!!
13142,Homer,so cool.
13143,Homer,i can't wait to meet the girls!
13148,Homer,because i talked to you.
13149,Homer,i couldn't see her through the flaps. but she's my kinda girl...
13150,Homer,"to me they were the rubbery gates of heaven, because behind them was the girl of my dreams."
13151,Homer,"well, i can ask if she has any friends, 'cause she wants to meet me tonight."

13458,Homer,"yeah, you have the right to remain silent."
13459,Homer,"bart, it's not like i'm asking you to give blood for free. that would be crazy! you're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. don't you know the story of hercules and the lion?"
13470,Homer,"""better half,"" marge. ""better half."""
13473,Homer,"marge, you're my wife and i love you very much. but you're living in a world of make-believe. with flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats..."

13518,Homer,"what did i tell you? i'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls..."
13519,Homer,"marge, what does it do?"
13520,Homer,"marge! really, what does it do?"
13527,Homer,"marge, i can't wear a pink shirt to work. everybody wears white shirts. i'm not popular enough to be different."
13528,Homer,"oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"

13582,Homer,"boy, when i get home, i'm going to wrap my hands around your neck --"
13588,Homer,come off. i'm sane now.
13599,Homer,"oh, marge. cartoons don't have any deep meaning. they're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh."
13601,Homer,"as tolstoy said in ""quotable notables,"" ""give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."""
13604,Homer,"it's not just one magazine, marge. they take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket."
13608,Homer,don't be so...
13609,Homer,"oh, you're right."
13618,Homer,uh-uh.
13621,Homer,we're all gonna die!

13734,Homer,"yeah, right. son... i'm gonna teach you a lesson. i'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. then maybe you'll learn..."
13735,Homer,"son, i'll never doubt you again."
13738,Homer,"oh, all right."
13741,Homer,"marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
13746,Homer,"eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple."
13755,Homer,"gotta think! gotta think! okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. the um... the, uh... the manual! the manual! right."

13800,Homer,"boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps."
13802,Homer,"no, that's it. you've seen everything."
13808,Homer,"i am very, very proud of you kids."
13809,Homer,i'd like to see that.
13810,Homer,what a dump. why would princess grace live in a place like this?
13818,Homer,"forget it, you two. as the pants- wearer of this house, i get the first wish."
13820,Homer,"ooh, a luxury car. good baby. good maggie."

13863,Homer,"you know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top."
13869,Homer,"okay, okay. but i want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. well i don't have one."
13881,Homer,that cost eighty-eight dollars!
13884,Homer,no wonder she hates me. i never even noticed that she was alive.
13886,Homer,"maybe i should just cut my losses, give up on lisa, and make a fresh start with maggie."
13907,Homer,u-su-ry?
13912,Homer,"simpson, you've done it again."
13921,Homer,i was hoping it'd be money.

13984,Homer,oh marge.
13996,Homer,"oh, my god. i don't know jack about my boy... i'm a bad father!"
14003,Homer,"oh, how i envy you!"

14012,Homer,"hmm... ""cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: no matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" huh?"
14013,Homer,"oh, that sounds too complicated."
14023,Homer,when did i ever teach you that?
14024,Homer,"don't be, no. go ahead, leave me. go on, go on and win. no, go on and win without your dad."
14027,Homer,why? what's wrong?
14040,Homer,"great, thanks."

14062,Homer,i decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
14073,Homer,take that off this second!
14075,Homer,i need to talk to moe.
14076,Homer,i didn't even tell you my name.

14184,Homer,"yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. for me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings."
14185,Homer,"yeah, but i have to hear about it."
14188,Homer,for several years i'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center.
14189,Homer,"yes, sir."
14200,Homer,i'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.

14207,Homer,"y'ello... oh, hi marge..."
14208,Homer,why? what's wrong?
14209,Homer,oh.
14212,Homer,"marge, there's something i want to ask you. but i'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal."
14213,Homer,"marge, i... damn it, where's that card?"
14215,Homer,what's it say?
14224,Homer,mucous.
14227,Homer,"finally, the big day came. we didn't have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line."

14265,Homer,"marge, for you."
14266,Homer,"oh, sure."
14270,Homer,"well, listen to me, mr. bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... i'm your man. you can treat me like dirt and i'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. and if you don't like it... i can change!!"
14280,Homer,"and tomorrow morning, i'm gonna buy your ring back! then i'm going house-hunting!"
14283,Homer,"hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me."

14376,Homer,you got it.
14380,Homer,"lisa, you've picked the winner every time! you must have some kind of special gift."
14390,Homer,"well, lisa, it's daddy-daughter day and daddy needs daughter's picks."
14394,Homer,not quite. they were out of the malibu stacie lunar rovers.
14396,Homer,"all right, marge. i'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad."
14397,Homer,"all right. if you must know, lisa and i have been gambling on pro football."
14413,Homer,"oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. i gotta get outta here."
14420,Homer,"all right, we're back in business."
14424,Homer,it's beautiful.

14523,Homer,maggie. oh. cute.
14531,Homer,three simple words. i am gay.
14533,Homer,"how about, ""with a love that will echo through the ages?"""
14545,Homer,"sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, i ran for cover under the tallest tree i could find."
14550,Homer,"check it out, boys. my magic bat."
14558,Homer,i play right field too.
14561,Homer,"marge, forget it. he's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than i do."
14563,Homer,i got it! i got it!
14570,Homer,"yeah, but none of my friends can watch me."
14578,Homer,"yes, sir!"
14588,Homer,we always have one good kid and one lousy kid. why can't both our kids be good?
14592,Homer,one hundred and thirty million dollars!

14843,Homer,"marge, there's an empty spot i've always had inside me. i tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. but those were dead ends. i think this chair is the answer."
14845,Homer,they're singing again. lousy neighbors. wish i was deaf.
14864,Homer,"i dunno, herb. people are afraid of new things. you should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something."
14866,Homer,"well, when is he gonna act like it?"
14870,Homer,"i see your point, brother."
14873,Homer,well it is.
14881,Homer,"now, bart. we made this deal because i thought it would help you get good grades. and you didn't. but why should you pay for my mistake?"
14883,Homer,"thanks son. now, you've got little hands. can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?"

16723,Homer,"union rule twenty-six - ""every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor."""
16726,Homer,nobody respects me at work.
16729,Homer,boring.
16734,Homer,"good. listen, i'm sick of your boring space launches. now i'm just an ordinary blue collar slob, but i know what i likes on tv..."
16735,Homer,shut up. and another thing - how come i can't get no tang 'round here? and also... hold on a second.
16738,Homer,"respect?! nooo! it was me! i made the crank call. i do it all the time. check with the fbi, i have a file. i have a fiiiiile."
16748,Homer,"ahem... i uh... don't think this contest is over yet, buzz. if that is your real name. i believe there is still a little something called the swimsuit competition."
16749,Homer,you mean i shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
16753,Homer,"marge, i don't really want to go through with this... but being an astronaut is how i got you to respect me."
16759,Homer,"... giver of life, mother of us all."
16763,Homer,no!
16774,Homer,"heh-heh-heh, i did it. second in line and all i had to do was miss eight days of work."
16777,Homer,oh stupid sheep.
16780,Homer,excellent guitar riff.
16789,Homer,"well, yeah."
16793,Homer,"hey everybody, here comes fun!"
16795,Homer,"well, i guess i should pay my share..."
16799,Homer,"we won! we won! flanders, we won!"
16804,Homer,it was him!
16808,Homer,no! i want everyone to know that this is ned flanders... my friend!
16810,Homer,i'll be there. and this time you can be the nacho man.
16815,Homer,hey what gives? i thought you had a satellite dish.
16817,Homer,hey everyone!
16826,Homer,"oh of course you'd say something like that, marge. you've hated ned for years. in fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe."
16830,Homer,"don't worry, i brought my rappin' ronnie reagan tape. it always makes the trip go faster."
16835,Homer,"i'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the simpsons and the flanders. if this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the flimpsons."
16847,Homer,neddie? neddddieee!
16848,Homer,hmmm. guess he didn't see me.
16849,Homer,"hey flanders, over here. i got us some kick-ass seats."
16850,Homer,i live to give.
16860,Homer,"push her down, son."
16866,Homer,shazam.
16870,Homer,nothing.
16877,Homer,"lisa, go to your room."
16878,Homer,wee!
16880,Homer,"marge, i agree with you, in theory. in theory communism works. in theory."
16882,Homer,maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry.
16883,Homer,"oh, everything's cruel according to you. keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. pulling on his tail is cruel. yelling in his ears is cruel. everything is cruel. so excuse me if i'm cruel."
16892,Homer,"oh. good luck. look at these bills. ""chain for elephant,"" ""shots for elephant""... ""oversized decorative poncho""."
16894,Homer,"then that's what i'll do, smart guy."
16898,Homer,your kid flew five feet. that counts as a ride. two bucks.
16904,Homer,"sorry, bart. i'm gonna have to sell him."
16909,Homer,thank you.
16911,Homer,"lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low."
16922,Homer,forget it. that elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
16924,Homer,"yes, of course i would. who wouldn't like that? to be part of the music scene..."
16926,Homer,"nah, that's okay. i'm pretty sure i can struggle my way out. first i'll just reach in and pull my legs out."
16929,Homer,"oh, i guess it wouldn't be right to sell stampy after he saved my life. and, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him."
16938,Homer,"okay, boy, i wrote down exactly what to say. just read it and you're a shoo-in."
16942,Homer,the boot kicked bart. it kicked him right in the butt.
16964,Homer,"and now i want you to meet your new brother, hans moleman."
16965,Homer,"give it a try. it's like kissing a peanut. heh, heh, heh."
16968,Homer,"but marge, dogs can never have enough excitement."
16969,Homer,"look! ree, ree. ree, ree. aye, aye. all right, all right, i won't take the dog. c'mere."
16972,Homer,that is true.
16993,Homer,"got it, barn?"
17013,Homer,"dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him."
17015,Homer,"that's right, money. your money's happiness is all that moneys."
17022,Homer,huh? oh. okay. i'll take three.
17027,Homer,how come you're not laughing? do you think i'm slow?
17031,Homer,"oh, and how is ""education"" supposed to make me feel smarter? besides, every time i learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. remember when i took that home wine making course and i forgot how to drive?"
17033,Homer,"wait a minute, even lenny is teaching a class. look at the way they admire and adore him."
17034,Homer,"that's it! if he can teach a class, he can teach a class. i mean, i can teach a class."
17050,Homer,"huh? yeah, i was listening. very funny."
17051,Homer,"uh, yes, yes. to the untrained eye i'm eating an orange. but to the eye that has brains, i am making a point about marriage. for you see, marriage is a lot like an orange."
17052,Homer,"first you have the skin, then the sweet, sweet innards."
17055,Homer,"no, that's not what i meant. marge and i always talk things over in bed. like the other night we were fighting about money."
17058,Homer,i went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word. i really think i was born to teach.
17061,Homer,"oh, you mean about you. all right, maybe i said some things -- some personal things. but, you should have seen 'em, marge. they really wanted to hear what i had to say."
17062,Homer,"look, marge, you don't know what it's like. i'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. and i'm not out of order. you're out of order. the whole freakin' system is out of order. you want the truth? you want the truth? you can't handle the truth. 'cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. forget it, marge - it's chinatown."
17068,Homer,"well let's just call 'em uh, ""mr. x"" and ""mrs. y."" so anyway, mr. x would say, 'marge, if this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't homer j. simpson.'"
17069,Homer,"not tonight, marge. tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home."
17075,Homer,"well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed..."
17076,Homer,"all right, we're breaking early tonight, class. for tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in lisa's diary."
17077,Homer,huh?
17081,Homer,"aw, marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing."
17082,Homer,"honey, the door blew shut! oh. fine. that's what you want? you got it. this scene is gettin' old, man. i'm hittin' the road. maybe i'll drop you a line someday from wherever i wind up in this crazy old world."
17088,Homer,"i love you... will you marry me, marge?... you mean i'm gonna be a daddy?... i hope we'll always be together... together... together..."
17090,Homer,"good news, lisa. i don't need your mother anymore. i've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way."
17093,Homer,"ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. oh, i miss marge. lisa you're smart. help me trick her into taking me back."
17099,Homer,"marge, i figured out what i can give you that no one else can."
17107,Homer,it's great to be indoors with my family.
17110,Homer,"hey, moe!"
17125,Homer,mmmm....
17129,Homer,"oh, i see. then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. really, i mean that. sorry if it sounded sarcastic."
17130,Homer,"lisa, stop the racket. i'm trying to fix your mother's camera. now easy... easy."
17134,Homer,cat!... deer!... old man!
17140,Homer,"those are prizes. ooo, a blasting cap!"
17143,Homer,woo hoo! a four day weekend!
17148,Homer,a-ha!
17154,Homer,"bees are on the what, now?"
17155,Homer,deal!
17163,Homer,hmmm.
17166,Homer,"oh, okay."
17170,Homer,hi.
17175,Homer,that's unsexy.
17181,Homer,"oh, mindy, we have to fight our temptation."
17191,Homer,she hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
17197,Homer,who? oh.
17205,Homer,oh yes.
17209,Homer,"lobster hat... fishnet speedo, jr... wheelie shoes... invisible dog leash. well, i'm packed."
17214,Homer,omigod! what'll i do? what'll i do?
17219,Homer,"we don't need to do that, marge. i'm not tired. i'm not tired at all."
17225,Homer,what's that?
17235,Homer,i kicked a giant mouse in the butt. do i have to draw you a diagram?
17241,Homer,"what're you, the narrator?"
17245,Homer,"nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. now, i'm not very political -- i usually think people who vote are a bit ""fruit-y"" -- but, for some reason, this birch barlow really speaks to me..."
17246,Homer,"when i'm driving the car, i get to choose the radio station. when you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station."
17247,Homer,i can't take this anymore. let's switch back.
17251,Homer,"oh, sideshow bob."
17264,Homer,"sorry, sorry. don't worry, there's plenty i can do to keep myself occupied. maybe i'll check out that axe collection. see ya later."
17279,Homer,fading... rising!
17284,Homer,"y'know, marge, i've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that i'm really a lucky guy."
17287,Homer,there! better than new! now to take her for a test toast.
17291,Homer,"fine. as long as i stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, i won't destroy the future."
17294,Homer,phew. i'm back.
17301,Homer,i gotta go back... fix future...
17310,Homer,"what's my name?! what color is the sky?! what of donuts? what?! for the love of god, tell meeeee!!!"
17311,Homer,nothing. nothing at all. let's just eat.
17315,Homer,"no, it's not that. didn't you hear? they have no bananas. they have no bananas today."
17317,Homer,probably misses his old glasses.
17318,Homer,"yeah, and then we'd get the chair."
17323,Homer,"son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money, that's all i need."
17328,Homer,to the little girl's room!
17331,Homer,done and done.
17333,Homer,"sports, sports, sports, sports. sports, sports, sports, sports. marge, bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports."
17336,Homer,"okay, son, just remember to have fun out there today, and if you lose, i'll kill you."
17341,Homer,"i don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. no jokes, no taunting... look! that kid's got bosoms! who's got a wet towel?"
17344,Homer,with her.
17352,Homer,"and if you get eaten, it's your own fault."
17357,Homer,"moe, what are you doin' here?"
17360,Homer,"well, you can't possibly like maggie best. what has she ever done? nothin' for nobody!"
17364,Homer,"beer. oh, marge, i love you!"
17367,Homer,"you like sweets, kids? i know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. in this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. you'd spit them out! you would! i'm talking about the candy industry trade show. ."
17374,Homer,"brilliant... exquisite ...ooh, you'll do well... gimme those, etc."
17379,Homer,must have rare gummy. distract the salesman marge!
17383,Homer,"wait a minute. wait a minute. where's my gummy de milo? okay, don't panic. she can't have gotten far; she has no arms."
17389,Homer,"hey, kids. lots of candy left for breakfast."
17390,Homer,oh no! the candy conventioneers tracked us down!
17401,Homer,"they're ruining my whole life. marge, please, this is where i need you the most. i'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better. okay-- go."
17407,Homer,"okay. say, can you introduce me to the sasquatch? i like his style."
17417,Homer,"ooh, ""portrait!"" sounds classy... doesn't it?"
17422,Homer,maybe tv is right. tv's always right.
17423,Homer,are you hugging the tv?
17424,Homer,"i like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. i know - ""evening at the improv."" they never talk about anything beyond the 1980s."
17430,Homer,precious venus...
17433,Homer,huh?
17437,Homer,"marge, my friend, i haven't learned a thing."
17453,Homer,never mind. you wouldn't understand.
17457,Homer,you're home safe. done my duty. see ya the next time we need your signature.
17459,Homer,"marge, i'll explain to you afterwards."
17467,Homer,they didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
17481,Homer,dad!
17488,Homer,here's where it all started to go wrong. how'm i supposed to be a good dad when i never had one myself?
17505,Homer,"wow, classy."
17508,Homer,"wait a minute. there's something bothering me about this place. i know - this lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit. enjoy your death trap, ladies."
17522,Homer,woo hoo!
17524,Homer,"but marge, you deserve a vacation. it's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state."
17527,Homer,"marge, what's wrong? are you hungry? sleepy? gassy? gassy? is it gas? it's gas, isn't it?"
17535,Homer,"you heard your mother's ramblings. she's fine, so behave."
17540,Homer,she's fine.
17544,Homer,"well keep it up, then."
17545,Homer,"good, you do that."
17546,Homer,you'll be picking many a bean.
17547,Homer,"bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down."
17558,Homer,"don't worry about a thing, honey. i'm gonna help you through this."
17568,Homer,"hey, how come you guys got better chairs than me?"
17573,Homer,"so anyway, lenny and carl are never around on wednesdays. and they don't tell me where they go. it's like a conspiracy."
17580,Homer,"stonecutters, eh? how do i join?"
17581,Homer,next.
17582,Homer,"so, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?"
17590,Homer,"not as such, no."
17592,Homer,huh?
17599,Homer,you outrank mr. burns here?
17605,Homer,oh really?
17609,Homer,"yep, but they gave me these rollerblades so i can glide to the front door."
17610,Homer,heh heh heh heh. sweet.
17619,Homer,"uh-oh. i need a bib. if i slop any on my shirt, i could lose the respect of my beloved brethren."
17629,Homer,peek-a-boo!
17630,Homer,i always wondered if there was a god. and now i know. there is. and it's me.
17631,Homer,so?
17642,Homer,"hm... i could help others. i'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the civil war ."
17646,Homer,"you were right, lisa. i've never felt so spiritually fulfilled. and with my brothers, the stonecutters, behind me, this is the beginning of a better world for all of us."
17647,Homer,"hey, fellas. can i join?"
17648,Homer,"loyal stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the battle of gettysburg."
17653,Homer,quiet. i will not hear another word against the boat.
17656,Homer,"so many memories. aw, look... knightboat."
17657,Homer,thanks honey. bank shot.
17660,Homer,that's exciting.
17666,Homer,not on my shift.
17673,Homer,"sorry, that just slipped out. i'll miss ya."
17676,Homer,such a nice tidy office. maybe it's time you started living like a pig!
17677,Homer,"oh, i hope i haven't upset you... bongo head!"
17679,Homer,"and that is that. goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. hello dream job in paradise."
17683,Homer,why?
17690,Homer,"i love you, marge."
17691,Homer,everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. i hope things stay exactly like this forever.
17694,Homer,hi maggie.
17695,Homer,"so anyhoo, back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant."
17696,Homer,"marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. i've got to wash my hair."
17701,Homer,"...i slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down."
17710,Homer,"it's true, the bundle is little. but i'm not in it for the money."
17711,Homer,"this is getting very abstract, but thank you. i do enjoy working at the bowling alley."
17731,Homer,"don't worry, joey. we'll make it to california some day."
17745,Homer,"come on marge, show a little enthusiasm."
17754,Homer,"i'm getting to that. so anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
17758,Homer,just a second.
17762,Homer,homer simpson takes care of his family.
17767,Homer,there it is.
17773,Homer,and it was a baby ox.
17775,Homer,i am holding still. i am squirming.
17793,Homer,lord save me.
17794,Homer,omigod! he's stealing all the burgers! why you little - i've got you!
17801,Homer,"uh, can't. i've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo."
17802,Homer,"uh... no. i'm going a different way than you, dick."
17815,Homer,"hey, what are these holes?"
17820,Homer,uh... actually my name is barney. yeah. barney gumbel.
17821,Homer,"uh... actually my real name is uh... think, krusty, think... joe valachi."
17823,Homer,krusty the clown.
17825,Homer,how 'bout if i just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere?
17826,Homer,okay.
17836,Homer,"there it is. ""aust-rali-a."" i'll be damned..."
17837,Homer,"look at this country: ""u - r - gay."""
17844,Homer,sweet land of liberty... of thee i sing.
17857,Homer,maaarge!
17861,Homer,take a guess.
17869,Homer,"sweet, trusting marge. i can't let you down. i'll get some money somehow."
17875,Homer,"no, my invention! all my money problems could've..."
17876,Homer,"oh, marge, my loyal wife, of course not."
17877,Homer,"and lisa, my little princess."
17879,Homer,"gosh, moe, i use these all the time. couldn't you just bash my head in?"
17881,Homer,"uh, i need an another extension on my mortgage payments."
17892,Homer,"all right, you had your fun. now get lost."
17895,Homer,"well, maybe i'll just stay and work overtime. my sisters-in-law are at my house again."
17909,Homer,nobody make me any breakfast. a man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.
17922,Homer,"oh, okay marge, i'll get along with them. then i will hug some snakes! yes, i will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. now that's sarcasm."
17931,Homer,"please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides."
17937,Homer,woo hoo!
17940,Homer,"relaxed fit, my aunt fanny! stupid dockers! oh, the belt is buckled."
17943,Homer,"marge, is this a pimple or a boil?"
17953,Homer,"marge, do you respect my intelligence?"
17954,Homer,okay! wait a minute. why did it take you so long to say yes?
17964,Homer,this contest is over. give that man the ten thousand dollars!
17965,Homer,but ... the ball... his groin!... it works on so many levels! roll it again.
17975,Homer,"aw, you know something marge, it's not that tough being a film cricket."
17976,Homer,"marge, look. this has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's beer nuts. mmm... beer nuts."
17979,Homer,i've eaten eight different meats. i'm a true renaissance man.
17982,Homer,"oh, i gotta call everyone and tell 'em the good news."
17985,Homer,"well, these seem to be in order. i'll be out back in the hammock."
18021,Homer,we can't lose. look at the name of the dog i bet on.
18027,Homer,get that cat out of the way!
18034,Homer,who wouldn't?
18035,Homer,"uh, i'm sorry, mr. burns, but you can't have these dogs. am i fired?"
18039,Homer,"lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. you just go in every day and do it really half-assed. that's the american way."
18050,Homer,"now get to school, boy."
18054,Homer,woo hoo!
18061,Homer,mmmmmm.
18070,Homer,"whoa, careful now. these are dangerous streets for us upper-lower-middle-class types... so avoid eye contact, watch your pocketbook and suspect everyone."
18074,Homer,no marge!!
18092,Homer,"all the more reason to hurry up. hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --"
18096,Homer,"hey, marge. how's my little piglet?"
18098,Homer,"i'll just be a second, marge. i'm going to get some beer for those kids over there."
18102,Homer,"what're you gonna do about it? what're you gonna do? ooh, i'm officer marge, i'm gonna arrest you! whoa! etc."
18108,Homer,"all right guys, pipe down. i've got some more in the garage."
18116,Homer,marge!
18120,Homer,"no, what i was wondering is..."
18121,Homer,"yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans."
18122,Homer,what for? nobody cared when bogart defaced that sidewalk in hollywood.
18129,Homer,"i don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!"
18135,Homer,no one in history has ever done anything this clever.
18136,Homer,"that's okay, son. i'll take care of him."
18141,Homer,--son!
18145,Homer,"well, he's not all bad. he did send me this nice thank-you card."
18156,Homer,sure! i've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
18157,Homer,"hey, i had a damn good reason. he could never remember my name..."
18167,Homer,"yeah. and who the hell are you talkin' to? marge, do you have other men in this house? radioactive men?"
18172,Homer,"hey, didn't you direct ""unnatural discretion""?"
18173,Homer,"hooey! whew, oh. you know, i never walk out of a movie, but eech!"
18174,Homer,you guys work on the movie?
18179,Homer,"what advantages does this motorcar have over, say, a train? which i could also afford."
18181,Homer,"oh, we'll clean up this afternoon."
18182,Homer,i got my dad to look after her.
18183,Homer,"c'mon, honey, you work yourself stupid for this family. if anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you."
18186,Homer,we leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away?!
18187,Homer,saxa-ma-phone. saxa-ma-phone.
18193,Homer,"oh, maggie. i got nothing against maggie."
18200,Homer,i wish i knew something about the baby i could miss now.
18202,Homer,"todd smells. aw, i already knew that."
18203,Homer,why you cotton pickin' --
18207,Homer,oh no! in the eyes of god they'll be flanderseseseses!
18210,Homer,son of a bitch...
18213,Homer,"i said shut your ugly face, flanders."
18215,Homer,yeah! gimme all the dirt!
18225,Homer,"wow, that's moe! the guy from the ad!"
18231,Homer,"moe? hey, moe? oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha?"
18233,Homer,let me get a pad....
18246,Homer,i can't believe you didn't invite me after i painted those cool stripes all over your car. i know! i'll throw my own barbecue - the greatest barbecue this town has ever seen! and i'll only invite who i want. that'll show ya.
18248,Homer,"this barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but i'm sure you're up to it, marge."
18276,Homer,that's it. go to your room.
18278,Homer,"lisa! lisa, come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father i am!"
18281,Homer,rock stars. is there anything they don't know?
18284,Homer,"ah, the miracle mile -- where value wears a neon sombrero and there's not a single church or library to offend the eye. it truly is a miracle."
18285,Homer,"there it is! the chain that put the ""fat"" in ""fat southern sheriffs!"""
18297,Homer,well... okay. if it'll end horror.
18311,Homer,that's weird. it's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.
18314,Homer,i'm somewhere where i don't know where i am.
18315,Homer,"just a second... no, it's a place i've never been before."
18317,Homer,"i don't want to alarm you, marge..."
18319,Homer,what's going on here? i'm so bulgy...
18326,Homer,yes.
18333,Homer,"piece of cake, son!"
18338,Homer,"ooh, erotic cakes!"
18342,Homer,two!
18349,Homer,"um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?"
18354,Homer,"yuh-huh, that's the deal. no more exercise program! no more traffic! no more blood drives or charity walks!"
18361,Homer,"what can i do to speed the whole thing up, doctor?"
18368,Homer,"hello, honey."
18371,Homer,beautiful. g'night.
18375,Homer,"well, that's a plus."
18377,Homer,oh my.
18381,Homer,"well, i use a computer!"
18389,Homer,venting prevents explo-si-on. this is hard. where's my tab? okay then -- yes. vent the stupid gas.
18391,Homer,"well, why don't you live in it then?"
18395,Homer,pro: i'm drought and famine resistant.
18396,Homer,"pro: i, uh... don't have to go to work."
18409,Homer,could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer--
18416,Homer,don't make me close the shade!
18423,Homer,"oh, that's raspberry."
18432,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? it's all my fault."
18446,Homer,"best six hundred bucks i ever spent. c'mon, boy. we've earned this saturday, now let's make the most of it."
18452,Homer,"""youngest daughter..."" well, how about this? this thing says my mother's still alive. she died when i was a kid."
18456,Homer,"damn you, walt whitman! i... hate... you... walt... freakin'... whitman! ""leaves of grass"" my ass! wait a minute. maybe it's that other grave. the one that says ""simpson."""
18460,Homer,some people say i look like dan aykroyd. i can't believe you're here. dad always told me you died while i was at the movies.
18485,Homer,"mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?"
18489,Homer,at least this time i'm awake for your goodbye.
18493,Homer,free duff! viva life!
18496,Homer,"oo, look, it's maggie!"
18497,Homer,uh... maggie?
18513,Homer,somebody ate those cookies.
18516,Homer,wake up everybody! it's world war three!
18522,Homer,"there you go. now that's not so bad, is it?"
18523,Homer,hello. my name is mr. burns. i believe you have a letter for me.
18531,Homer,ants!
18540,Homer,"bart, you're coming home."
18546,Homer,"marge, is lisa at camp granada?"
18551,Homer,uh-oh. somebody's got tired little legs.
18553,Homer,"maybe it's ""sporting goods""... wait, no, ""sleepwear""... oh, probably ""better living."""
18556,Homer,what are you doing to my son?!!
18568,Homer,i'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. i wannabe a league bowler.
18570,Homer,woo hoo! we won! we won!
18580,Homer,"hey, everybody, if you want to ask burns for a favor, now's the time! he's doped up or dyin' or something!"
18582,Homer,"c'mon, guys. let's be the team that supports each other. you can do it otto / you can do it otto / help each other out, that'll be our motto..."
18591,Homer,"there it is, boys, the championship trophy!"
18594,Homer,gotta go. my damn wiener kids are listening.
18597,Homer,"by the way, rhyming homer with homer..."
18608,Homer,thanks.
18610,Homer,"i guess some people never change. or they quickly change, and then quickly change back."
18611,Homer,saturday afternoon tv is so boring.
18612,Homer,"marge, i'm bored."
18619,Homer,"well, ready for the big rummage sale?"
18621,Homer,"hey! what's wrong with this neighborhood? big shot. too good to buy a house here, snobby?"
18622,Homer,the guy who doesn't live there.
18623,Homer,"but, marge, it works on any ayatollah! ayatollah nakhbadeh, ayatollah zahedi... even as we speak, ayatollah razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power!"
18627,Homer,hey everybody! who thinks flanders should shut up?
18630,Homer,say. that ayatollah thinks he's better than america. is he right?
18631,Homer,"well, for only five dollars you can sock it to him in style!"
18636,Homer,"thank you, neighbors, thank you! now let's give it up for table five! ah-ah-ah-ah / table five, table five... ah-ah-ah-ah / table fi-i-i-i-i-i-ve..."
18642,Homer,"wait a minute. if lisa didn't vote for him, and i didn't vote for him--"
18643,Homer,"i voted for prell to go back to the old glass bottle. after that, i became deeply cynical."
18652,Homer,"first bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way i talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! well, that's it!"
18653,Homer,"hey, bush! get out here!"
18655,Homer,you owe me an apology!
18662,Homer,yoo hoo?
18665,Homer,he's not lost.
18676,Homer,"yes, mr. ford!"
18684,Homer,you look great.
18692,Homer,"boy, marge, you must've really done a number on those rich suckers."
18693,Homer,that's one way.
18702,Homer,yes.
18707,Homer,and what are you doing with his ball?
18710,Homer,so you're not the best golfer here! wait'll i tell everyone about this! you stink!
18713,Homer,"but marge, valets. for once, maybe someone will call me ""sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene."""
18727,Homer,"don't worry, son. i'm sure he's up in heaven right now, laughing it up with all the other celebrities -- john dillinger, ty cobb, joseph stalin... i wish i were dead."
18729,Homer,"hey, they need volunteers to play old-timey people in the parade. look, i can be a butter churner, a typhoid carrier... an apprentice! i think i'll be an apprentice, marge."
18730,Homer,that's for my master to decide.
18735,Homer,"less chat, more hat."
18746,Homer,lisa?
18754,Homer,i'm just waitin' for my kid.
18756,Homer,"hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about jebediah springfield."
18758,Homer,dig up his grave! pull out his tongue!
18768,Homer,"um, is this the chair i'll be sitting on?"
18773,Homer,"um, what do i do in case of fire?"
18776,Homer,but i think the dodo went extinct...
18777,Homer,"uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? the things?"
18781,Homer,"well, it's my job to cook him breakfast, and i'm gonna cook the best damned breakfast he ever ate!"
18784,Homer,"yes, sir, i did."
18785,Homer,the accounting department is located on the third floor. its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. the head of this department is a mr. johnson or johnstone.
18792,Homer,yello?... it's for you.
18797,Homer,"i'm really sorry i hit you, mr. burns. here, let me put some salt on that eye."
18802,Homer,"mr. burns, is there anything at all i can do for you?"
18803,Homer,you shouldn't've gone away on vacation.
18805,Homer,"mr. smithers, wait!"
18807,Homer,"okay, i gotcha covered."
18809,Homer,got it.
18813,Homer,"son, this is mrs. burns! i just called to say i don't love you. you are a bad son, montel!"
18816,Homer,i'll show you.
18825,Homer,"oh, it's just bart and a mysterious stranger."
18828,Homer,okay. grampa.
18830,Homer,"woo hoo! look, marge! a couple of bucks!"
18832,Homer,oh... forget it.
18838,Homer,down in front!
18847,Homer,'cause they won't hire an assistant.
18849,Homer,this has purple stuff inside. purple is a fruit.
18850,Homer,"uh... oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country. as a safety inspector, i am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs."
18852,Homer,i don't know.
18858,Homer,great! ya wanna get some lunch?
18859,Homer,"the way i figure it, if the candy stays in the machine for more than a year, it's up for grabs."
18871,Homer,"moe thinks he knows a lot more than moe knows! well, just give me another chance, and i'll prove i can keep your secrets."
18872,Homer,i have no idea who that is.
18874,Homer,"what's wrong, honey?"
18875,Homer,"uh, you don't have to tell me, but i thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. i mean, i haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend."
18876,Homer,i promise.
18879,Homer,"okay, we'll work this out together. first things first: where is knoxville?"
18882,Homer,"and have it sent to the springfield nuclear power plant, care of homer j.--"
18883,Homer,forget the name homer simpson. have it sent care of... langdon alger.
18887,Homer,"it's okay. it's okay. i'm back. see, daddy's here."
18890,Homer,"okay. okay. think, homer..."
18899,Homer,where are you two going at this hour?
18901,Homer,pass.
18903,Homer,"let's all calm down. everyone's going to be just fine, as long as i've got enough beer."
18905,Homer,now to drop gracefully through the windshield.
18915,Homer,uh-huh.
18916,Homer,"lisa, i want to buy your rock."
18918,Homer,hey... how come my pay is so low?
18922,Homer,"open your eyes, lisa. our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like bart have lost the will to learn."
18942,Homer,"no, no, and no. maybe we should start all over with the electrical college."
18943,Homer,"sleep is for the weak, apu! now i'm gonna go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history."
18947,Homer,"now that you're all relaxed... most of us here were born in america. we take this country for granted. but not immigrants like apu. while the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid, they're driving the cabs that get us home safely..."
18956,Homer,"pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?"
18964,Homer,"now -- grand funk railroad paved the way for jefferson airplane, which cleared the way for jefferson starship. the stage was now set for the alan parsons project, which i believe was some sort of hovercraft..."
18968,Homer,"but you've got all the top bands in here. styx? i just heard them on ""the king biscuit flour hour."" now here are some of your no-name bands: sonic youth, nine inch nails, hullabalooza..."
18970,Homer,the us festival! geez! it was sponsored by that guy from apple computers.
18972,Homer,"back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible."
18981,Homer,well... what have we here? looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to hullabalooza.
18983,Homer,"oh, my homemade kahlua."
18985,Homer,"oh, i get it."
18990,Homer,"cool concert, am i right?"
19007,Homer,"but the main thing is, i've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes rock 'n' roll the king of musics."
19008,Homer,woo hoo!
19014,Homer,that was odd.
19025,Homer,"oh, i'm gonna die."
19026,Homer,"oh, marge. i thought i had an appetite for destruction, but all i wanted was a club sandwich."
19028,Homer,"i'll miss you pumpkins, but i just can't share your bleak world view. i've got too much to live for."
19032,Homer,i only get two weeks of vacation a year -- and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house?
19035,Homer,"hey. hmm, somebody's travelin' light."
19042,Homer,hello.
19044,Homer,"ooh, captain of the football team! he's a dreamboat! don't wait up, marge."
19046,Homer,"you've got friends. you got ""the dud"" right here. stand up for yourself, poindexter!"
19048,Homer,"um... let me have one of those porno magazines... a large box of condoms... a bottle of old harper... a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas. no, make it two."
19052,Homer,"wait, i got it."
19055,Homer,"well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids."
19059,Homer,no more questions. i work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do i -- what?
19069,Homer,"ahh, the ole fishin' hole. so peaceful and relaxing, it doesn't even matter if i catch a single fish."
19071,Homer,what the-- whosa-- sonofa-
19078,Homer,"marge, marge! there i was, i had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when i was abducted by a flying saucer!"
19087,Homer,it's in cypress creek. upstate somewhere.
19088,Homer,"oh yeah. so long, stinktown."
19093,Homer,"but marge, this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream."
19102,Homer,yes.
19105,Homer,"here we are, 15201 maple systems road... our new home."
19115,Homer,ye... no.
19116,Homer,don't worry. that won't take long.
19118,Homer,doh!
19120,Homer,"could you, um... work any harder than this?"
19121,Homer,"hey, call me homer."
19124,Homer,"tom landry's hat! and it's autographed! ""to berman's dry cleaning, best wishes, tom landry."""
19130,Homer,"sir, i need to know where i can get some business hammocks."
19135,Homer,right...
19137,Homer,fine.
19138,Homer,yes.
19143,Homer,france.
19145,Homer,"eh, you have any sugar around here?"
19151,Homer,"what?! we've got it great here. and for the first time in my life, i'm actually good at my job. my team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions."
19153,Homer,"well, it's pretty important."
19164,Homer,like bull you don't! come on!
19169,Homer,"son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. you've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. coming to me was a good start."
19174,Homer,dressing?
19185,Homer,lousy democrats.
19186,Homer,no problemo.
19187,Homer,"oh, why me?"
19190,Homer,then i can just push him over.
19202,Homer,"marge, will you let me finish? ...plug-in room deodorizers, front and rear spoilers for the car --"
19209,Homer,"aaar, matey."
19213,Homer,"yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today."
19214,Homer,twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
19218,Homer,"oh, yes we are!"
19219,Homer,"oh, yes, there is!"
19220,Homer,"and i think it's the best idea i've ever had! we're picking up the weirdo, and that's final."
19229,Homer,"eh, i should go."
19233,Homer,"hiding out? marge, you've been reading too many hideout books."
19235,Homer,"hello, mr. burns, this is the kidnapper. do you miss your son?"
19241,Homer,still?
19243,Homer,the abandoned warehouse!
19246,Homer,"heh-heh, they'll never look for us here."
19253,Homer,"sorry, sorry. my fault."
19255,Homer,no problem... can do.
19261,Homer,"geez, look at this place. we gotta do something."
19263,Homer,knock yourself out.
19264,Homer,just a minute!
19273,Homer,"i told you last night, no! where is bart, anyway? his dinner's getting all cold and eaten."
19279,Homer,"oh, yeah, drugs. ya gotta have drugs."
19286,Homer,"don't you worry, son."
19287,Homer,my friends! stop!
19291,Homer,"you could close down moe's or the kwik-e-mart, and nobody would care / but the heart and soul of springfield's in our maison derriere..."
19294,Homer,hey...
19295,Homer,easy...
19296,Homer,"marge, can't we get some clear plates? i can't see the tv."
19297,Homer,yoink.
19304,Homer,i just gotta put my shoes on.
19305,Homer,"you know what you two need? a little comic strip called ""love is."" it's about two naked eight year olds who are married."
19307,Homer,boring!
19310,Homer,"g'night... thanks for coming... we'll see you... ba-bye... well, i think that went pretty well."
19311,Homer,"marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago."
19320,Homer,okay. love you.
19324,Homer,"oh, and for yourself."
19334,Homer,mm-hm.
19337,Homer,"good morning. you know, marge, i was thinking about how much i enjoy your interests, so i wandered over to that theater you went to last night. and i bought tickets to their entire season."
19342,Homer,"oh, i've just made things worse. a few clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for 10 years of neglect. marge deserves someone who will treat her right. marge deserves a fresh start."
19343,Homer,"i'd like to file, for divorce."
19355,Homer,"hey, what's this thing?"
19358,Homer,let me show you how it works. this baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. it automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. listen.
19360,Homer,tele-panhandling.
19367,Homer,... is it... wah?
19384,Homer,the living and dining rooms... with a lovely flow for entertaining...
19387,Homer,"so, flanders, what do you think of the house that love built?"
19398,Homer,"you know what your problem is, flanders? you're afraid to be human."
19402,Homer,see? you like everything.
19403,Homer,"ned, you so crazy."
19408,Homer,"lenny? aw, well. if it was big and annual i'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper."
19424,Homer,"uh, wiggy...? my chili's gettin' cold."
19428,Homer,"maybe i do, son. maybe i do."
19430,Homer,"more, please."
19432,Homer,"heh, heh! my finest hour! and marge wasn't even here to see it."
19433,Homer,ooh. i don't feel so good.
19436,Homer,where am i? shelbyville?
19441,Homer,note to self: stop doing anything.
19446,Homer,"oh. you want me to climb that, huh? no problemo."
19453,Homer,"if it's about laying off the insanity peppers, i'm way ahead of you."
19459,Homer,soul mate?
19464,Homer,carl?
19472,Homer,"oh, honey, i didn't get drunk. i just went to a strange fantasy world. c'mon, you gotta believe me. you're my soul mate."
19475,Homer,"look at these records! jim nabors, glen campbell, the doodletown pipers! now look at her records... they stink! maybe i had that crazy dream for a reason..."
19477,Homer,"...i always just figured my wife was my soul mate. but if it's not marge, then who is it? where do i begin looking?"
19485,Homer,earl. my new friend's name is earl!
19486,Homer,"here i come, buddy! no more loneliness for homer and earl...."
19488,Homer,"alone! i'm alone! i'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!"
19490,Homer,"come here, people!"
19494,Homer,"or that little guy on the ""don't walk"" sign."
19496,Homer,"right, and we don't like the same things. it's like you're from venus..."
19507,Homer,"then, i insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop..."
19508,Homer,"nah, it's friday night moe. i wanna try something special."
19509,Homer,skoal! wait a minute -- this is duff!
19518,Homer,"no! well, ten beers..."
19522,Homer,oh. it's bart. i can't believe it. i'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!
19525,Homer,"oh, it was awful. they set me on a cold metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes and the -- oh wait, that was my physical."
19526,Homer,the alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like urkel! and he appears every friday night -- like urkel!
19530,Homer,ow.
19533,Homer,"you are one fine-lookin' woman, lady. if i wasn't married, i'd go out with you like that."
19543,Homer,"oh, i suppose you're going to mock me, too."
19555,Homer,bwah! bwah! bwaaaaah!
19565,Homer,i'll take two!
19569,Homer,"what do you need to make money for anyway? as long as i have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about."
19573,Homer,"uh, your fish are dead."
19590,Homer,how could i not? i saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. i saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into america's already bloated snack-hole. so i did what i could. i did what any loving husband would do: i reached out to some violent mobsters.
19593,Homer,now what?
19594,Homer,"you heard her. she said ""no."""
19601,Homer,"hit 'em, carl! you too, lenny!"
19608,Homer,"hey, this sounds like fun."
19610,Homer,oooh.
19612,Homer,"yes, lotta hysteria..."
19615,Homer,no sir. i am not.
19617,Homer,no going through the window for us!
19619,Homer,"oh, these sure are comfortable chairs."
19625,Homer,"um, i don't see one. unless..."
19629,Homer,i think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.
19631,Homer,i think they've stopped. .
19633,Homer,it could be days before they find us.
19643,Homer,"marge, kids."
19644,Homer,"you said it, ya weirdo."
19651,Homer,"oh, there's no way i could --"
19668,Homer,"now ms. bobbins, if you want this job you're going to have to answer a few questions. first, do you have any bad habits?"
19676,Homer,"come to bed, marge."
19679,Homer,"ooh, i can't get enough of this blood pudding."
19691,Homer,i'm sure we will.
19693,Homer,i do not!
19697,Homer,ruff ruff! i'm poochie the rockin' dog.
19702,Homer,"she smells sheet smells by the sheet store. wait, wait. lemme try it again."
19705,Homer,"you mean ""meep meep""?"
19706,Homer,"uh, i guess. is this episode going on the air live?"
19714,Homer,then they said they were gonna kill poochie off!
19719,Homer,"you can't just kill off a classic tv character. poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. that's why i'm gonna read these lines i wrote myself with my own two hands."
19721,Homer,"now, kids -- i know you loved the old poochie...but the new one's going to be better than ten superbowls. i don't want to oversell it. judge for yourselves."
19722,Homer,"hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! those finks double-crossed me!"
19726,Homer,that is so true.
19728,Homer,give her a break! her husband was killed!

19973,Homer,"oh, my god, what is that?..."
19974,Homer,why would you volunteer at the church?
19975,Homer,"volunteering is for suckers! do you know that so-called ""volunteers"" don't even get paid?"

19983,Homer,"uh, hello? why am i mr. sparkle?"
19986,Homer,put it in! put it in!

19988,Homer,"well, it was a good ride while it lasted. c'mon kids. let's go home."
19994,Homer,can i have this one?
19998,Homer,wow. you've got pencils with your name on 'em. just like a pencil company executive. i'd give anything for one of these.
20000,Homer,"hey, you seem like a great guy, so i'll give you a little tip. if you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know."
20001,Homer,"oh, yeah, they're always trying to screw ya."

20035,Homer,what are you saying?
20036,Homer,the car won't start. and i don't feel very good today. i am at work.
20046,Homer,then i added some fins to lower wind resistance. and this racing stripe here i feel is pretty sharp.
20050,Homer,over there.
20071,Homer,not very.
20075,Homer,that's not so disciplined.
20086,Homer,you got the black one.
20091,Homer,"marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts."
20096,Homer,it's time i told you about a chapter of my life i hoped would be closed forever. i was on my way to the harrisburg coat outlet to buy an irregular coat. but it required a stopover in new york city.
20100,Homer,"lousy bart... his money... all right, new york, i'm coming back. but you're not getting this!"
20101,Homer,don't you start.
20105,Homer,"now remember, criminals prey on small-town folk like us. so if anyone asks, we're sophisticated millionaires from the ozarks."
20109,Homer,your vehicle is illegally parked at one world trade plaza. hmmm...
20121,Homer,geez! that's just... awful!
20122,Homer,"mmmm. now, what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth?"
20126,Homer,mmmmm.

20149,Homer,come on! let's go! everyone into the car! now!
20151,Homer,we'll see.
20152,Homer,"ooh, a fresh batch of america balls! mmm..."
20153,Homer,"look, lady, you obviously have at least one son."
20158,Homer,and why are you and the old lady in the car?
20166,Homer,"now, if you'll allow me, i think i have a solution that'll satisfy the town and let sgt. skinner keep his dignity."
20180,Homer,"lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better i'll destroy something bart loves."
20185,Homer,lousy traumatic childhood.
20193,Homer,"oh, it's beautiful! oh! oh, let's put bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!"
20194,Homer,"oh, all right. what a- burn it! send it to hell!"
20196,Homer,"bart, son. you wanna play catch?"
20201,Homer,wow. just think of the possibilities.
20203,Homer,hm.
20204,Homer,"well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her."
20205,Homer,i'll give ya fifty bucks.
20209,Homer,"our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. bart was miserable at school, and lisa's gifts were going to waste."
20211,Homer,"dad, what are you doin' here?"
20213,Homer,"uh-uh. forget it marge. there is no way i am spending my saturdays at a museum. unless... museums don't have foosball, do they?"
20217,Homer,"marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning."
20222,Homer,"what, flanders."
20228,Homer,a musical instrument? could that be a way to encourage a gifted child? just give me a sign!
20230,Homer,"so what do you like, lisa? viomalin... tubamaba... obomoboe?"
20232,Homer,two hundred dollars!
20233,Homer,"oh, i'll take it."
20234,Homer,"yeah. ""to lisa. never forget your daddy loves ."""
20235,Homer,...and that inscription is still there today.
20240,Homer,i learned from the master.
20242,Homer,stupid hippo.
20244,Homer,"relax, i built a bomb shelter."
20245,Homer,"fine, then don't use it."
20251,Homer,"it's green, moron. earth to stupid guy, hullo? maybe a little friendly punching will move your ass."
20263,Homer,"hey, what the hell's goin' on? where'd you get those cloaks?"
20272,Homer,"ohh, com'ere."
20274,Homer,"so, who wants to steal some ferraris?"
20278,Homer,i said i'll take it.
20286,Homer,i think she's right. the pants are a dead giveaway.
20287,Homer,"so then lenny says, ""as if! don't even go there, sister."""
20312,Homer,all done.
20315,Homer,"watch the fish, marge."
20329,Homer,five days! but i'm mad now!
20332,Homer,"well, if he didn't have any guns, i'd show him a thing or two."
20334,Homer,marge kicked me out.
20349,Homer,tv said that? but i have to have a gun. it's in the constitution.
20363,Homer,"sure thing, honey."
20364,Homer,you want me to get the cat down?
20369,Homer,"oops, guess it already was on."
20375,Homer,"but marge, i swear to you, i never thought you'd find out!"
20376,Homer,so this is the thanks i get for protecting my family? then go! i'll be just fine!
20379,Homer,they're here! they're here!
20386,Homer,this stinks. i want my family back.
20387,Homer,"marge? sorry. marge? oh, sorry. marge?"
20392,Homer,"oh, honey, please come home. i need you. it's dark in the house and i'm hungry and lonesome. and there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks."
20398,Homer,"i'm sorry i lied to you, marge. but this gun had a hold on me. i felt this incredible surge of power, like god must feel when he's holding a gun. so please, get rid of it, because i know i'll just lie to you again and again!"
20403,Homer,"hey, flanders. you're the worst coach this team has ever had."
20404,Homer,"yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot."
20411,Homer,"yeah, homer again. i think we got cut off. y'ello?"
20415,Homer,"i know, sweetie, and i got him right in the... uh-oh."
20417,Homer,"no, no. no, no, no. it's just that, well, like i was yelling earlier, it seems like anyone with half a brain could coach better than you."
20418,Homer,me? but you were doing such a great job.
20423,Homer,"i'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. from now on, i'm gonna work you like a dog. now go fetch me twenty laps."
20425,Homer,"well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, i'd like to hear it."
20427,Homer,my father never believed in me.
20438,Homer,"not any more. from now on, you're my main man. okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. oh, rod, you don't have to. you're cut."
20443,Homer,look at him go!
20445,Homer,"great debut, son. you really settled in after some early jitters."
20466,Homer,i've got lots of quarters.
20468,Homer,consider him cut.
20471,Homer,"oh no, my quarterback. what are we gonna do?"
20483,Homer,tell her the truth. you're not ready to get married.
20484,Homer,then just tell her you're already married.
20492,Homer,then maybe you shouldn't of told her you did.
20494,Homer,"wellll, you could always move into my house, and tell your mom that marge is your wife."
20495,Homer,it's you.
20497,Homer,"oh, crap, i forgot!"
20498,Homer,"marge, i need a small favor. for the next few days, will you pretend to be apu's wife?"
20499,Homer,please? it's just for as long as his mother's living here.
20508,Homer,"hey! they got chairs with wheels, and here i am using my legs like a sucker!"
20517,Homer,and here i am using my own lungs like a sucker! and how come everyone gets a bedpan and i have to walk all the way over there?
20532,Homer,"gods, eh?"
20533,Homer,screw him.
20544,Homer,i didn't like it. the mast had termites.
20547,Homer,lemme through! i got here late!
20556,Homer,"get your own angel, ya moocher."
20561,Homer,"no one's calling it an angel, lisa. if you'll look carefully, you'll notice i never once used the word ""angel""."
20563,Homer,"oh, no. oh, no. we could lose out on bags and bags of money. it's sacrilegious, i tell ya."
20578,Homer,it is?
20580,Homer,"oh, that."
20581,Homer,ah.
20586,Homer,"allll right, i hear ya, honey. change into something nice. we're steppin' out!"
20588,Homer,"wow, sweetheart. look at all this seized booty. we could find the drug boat of our dreams!"

20597,Homer,you betcha.
20600,Homer,i see.
20601,Homer,"i don't know, marge. trying is the first step toward failure."
20603,Homer,what about me? you didn't thank me.
20608,Homer,"hey, skinner! wanna drag race?"
20611,Homer,lousy doormat.
20613,Homer,"kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. why don't we let her clear the table in peace?"
20617,Homer,"yeah, me too. let me know if you need any help."
20618,Homer,it was just an expression.
20626,Homer,...punk!
20627,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
20631,Homer,"you know me, marge. i crave the hustle and bustle."
20633,Homer,"attention, shoppers. register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience."
20635,Homer,register 9 is now closed.
20637,Homer,knock it off...
20639,Homer,can - we - skip - church?
20640,Homer,"well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: god hates us."
20643,Homer,that's not as fun as it looks.
20649,Homer,you shut up.
20650,Homer,"oh, marge, i don't wanna hear any more about that silver polish."
20654,Homer,"marge, kids, let's go buy some happiness!"
20663,Homer,"i'm gonna kill you! / no, i'm killing him first! / why you little... bart, the next time you ever have... / you went too far..."
20668,Homer,"oh, no. look at the line!"
20670,Homer,"run for your lives, everyone! this is not a drill!"
20674,Homer,what the hell's goin' on?
20677,Homer,"gimme that! / uh, gimme that! / no! / let go! / gimme that my washcloth! / i want it!"
20679,Homer,go!

20687,Homer,bart!
20698,Homer,"all right marge, you've convinced me, there are more terrible things / than musical comedies where everyone sings."
20699,Homer,and not a moment too soon.
20707,Homer,oo! oo! me first!
20710,Homer,"he's not just some ""guy,"" marge. he's a carny, and part of a noble tradition. carnies built this country. the carnival part of it, anyway. and though they may be rat-like in appearance, they are truly kings among men."
20715,Homer,"sorry, son. daddy failed."
20716,Homer,a novelty comb! kings among men...
20725,Homer,"yes, sir!"
20734,Homer,"ah, yes. how do we handle refunds?"
20735,Homer,gimme ten rings.
20739,Homer,i understand.
20740,Homer,"not right now, son. daddy's talking to a policeman."
20752,Homer,that's weird. the key doesn't fit.
20756,Homer,thank you so much.
20757,Homer,"honey, daddy's waiting for the detective."
20758,Homer,"listen to 'em, watching my television, sittin' on my couch... you better not be in my ass-groove!"
20763,Homer,"aw, you can't outsmart carnival folk. they're the cleverest folk in the world. just look at the way they sucker regular folk with those crooked games. that's it! fire! or..."
20765,Homer,"one game of ring toss. if i can throw this hula hoop onto the chimney, you'll give us our house back. if i miss, i'll sign the deed over to you."
20771,Homer,they mushed it all out of shape.
20774,Homer,"i always say, a boy can learn more at an airport than he can at any school."
20784,Homer,"who cares what it is? the point is these are some decent, generous people that i can take advantage of."
20790,Homer,fish-ing.
20792,Homer,will there be beer?
20793,Homer,homer no function beer well without.
20798,Homer,"now wait a minute, moe --"
20803,Homer,"oh, my mistake."
20813,Homer,what? what did i say?
20816,Homer,"hah, why even unpack?"
20822,Homer,"but marge, we're not mass married."
20826,Homer,the leader knows all and sees all.
20828,Homer,beer?
20845,Homer,"no time to answer that, marge. i'm setting up a home office for my new business enterprise."
20847,Homer,"oh yeah, everybody's making money off the internet except us. we've fallen behind. way behind."
20848,Homer,"can't discuss that now, marge. i have to write another delicious memo."
20850,Homer,"what am i gonna call my internet company? all the good names are taken. oh, wait, i've got it! flancrest enterprises."
20860,Homer,"get a load of the bowl job, marge."
20863,Homer,"hey, what the hell's going on?!"
20869,Homer,a rest home for pirates?
20876,Homer,"woop, sorry son. i didn't know you, jay leno, and a monkey were bathing a clown."
20882,Homer,woo! tv! yeah!
20893,Homer,hmmm.
20895,Homer,hi sweetie. i'm off to moe's. love ya.
20897,Homer,whatever happened to your mail order bride?
20899,Homer,"now, now, i won't hear of it, moe. you're a fabulous catch."
20902,Homer,relax. all i smell is garlic and fish.
20903,Homer,"okay, i won't lie to you. a lot of people saw that. but you gotta keep tryin'."
20907,Homer,maa-rrge...
20911,Homer,"steal? oh no, you got the wrong guy."
20918,Homer,"you're a genius, moe. all your troubles will soon be over for a couple months."
20925,Homer,"""stealing, stealing / stealing a car for moe / dada dada dada dada / insurance fraud today..."""
20927,Homer,that's what you get for not hailing to the chimp.
20928,Homer,"oh, no! the train!"
20932,Homer,huh?
20934,Homer,"oh. oh. oh. oh! great! listen, i know it looks bad. but all i can tell you is i destroyed that car for all the right reasons."
20941,Homer,"but moe, we're best friends..."
20947,Homer,must kill moe. wheeeeee! must kill moe. wheeeeee!
20949,Homer,"oh-ho, i'll help you. help you die!"
20955,Homer,"oh, forget it!"
20958,Homer,"hey, hey look, a freezer man!"
20962,Homer,room for one more...
20965,Homer,"boy, seeing that stomach surgery made me hungry! marge, we need five thousand cc's of snacks, stat!"
20967,Homer,"what way, angel pie?"
20969,Homer,"if i were her, i'd be buying me a great big chocolate apology cake."
20979,Homer,"well uh, you look pretty successful."
20983,Homer,"fine, fine. what do you do... ""dr. simpson""?"
20986,Homer,"yeah. good things don't end with ""eum."" they end with ""mania""... or ""teria."" will there be beer?"
20987,Homer,what'd he say? what about my car?
20989,Homer,"ovulate, damn you! ovulate!"
20996,Homer,"you're the man, ralph!"
20999,Homer,"mmmm, donuts."

21003,Homer,it's my first day.
21006,Homer,i've joined the naval reserve.
21009,Homer,then i'll do it!
21014,Homer,"not to worry, honey. we live in a highly technological age, where fighting a war is as simple as turning off a light."
21026,Homer,what the--?
21027,Homer,"uh, a seagull took my sailor hat."
21030,Homer,"well, i'm no margaret cho, but i do a pretty fair columbo impression. ah, one more thing - one- i should get a glass of water."
21034,Homer,marge!
21040,Homer,i always thought lisa would be the one to get her ears pierced.
21047,Homer,"well, when i was ten i got my ear pierced but this is completely different!"
21052,Homer,uh-huh.
21053,Homer,with a knife.
21058,Homer,hmm. what would the captain say in my spot?
21059,Homer,fire the torpedoes!
21063,Homer,mr. moe -- steady as she goes!
21073,Homer,you mean water?
21075,Homer,bart!
21076,Homer,"i'll plug your hole. i mean, eureka!"
21082,Homer,"well, i couldn't have done it without bart."
21090,Homer,will you look at those morons? i paid my taxes over a year ago.
21094,Homer,"marge, how many kids do we have? oh, no time to count, i'll just estimate. uh, nine."
21102,Homer,well...
21108,Homer,"okay, but could you pay me under the table? i got a little tax problem."
21114,Homer,"hey, i see you're watchin' the ball game. looks like a good one. any of you involved in any illegal activity? cause i could sure go for some."
21115,Homer,"how 'bout you, lenny? testing, testing? lenny?"
21116,Homer,maybe. but first i need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.
21119,Homer,"oh, that's ridiculous, moe. end transmission."
21120,Homer,"well, i'm just glad it's all over."
21130,Homer,still cold.
21138,Homer,"hey, that guy looks like you."
21151,Homer,"oh, you're gonna love it in cuba, marge. there's shredded pork everywhere."
21153,Homer,i had no idea.

21158,Homer,"that'll do it, apu. so just--"
21166,Homer,"there a problem, honey?"
21169,Homer,"this ""filthy monkey"" made the orange juice you're drinking."

21187,Homer,"yes, but the memories will last a lifetime."
21190,Homer,"ooh, but i can rebuild!"

21204,Homer,sorry ned. i didn't see you down there. got him.
21206,Homer,"so-ho, the rats seem happy."
21209,Homer,"yeah, but i'm always secretly disappointed when you do. anyway, i think those garbage men are starting to crack."
21214,Homer,"this is a very, very proud day for us, especially me. your father, me, beat city hall. it's just like david and goliath, only this time david won."
21217,Homer,"but this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. and i'm going to get it back. lisa, do i have my pants on?"

21326,Homer,"sorry, i only eat food in bar form. when you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, i'm told. that's why i'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar."
21328,Homer,"hospital, please."

21408,Homer,"stupid risks are what make life worth living. now your mother, she's the steady type, and that's fine in small doses. but me, i'm a risk taker. and that's why i have so many adventures."
21413,Homer,good. you're gonna need that adrenaline to make the final jump.
21416,Homer,"well, daddy will figure it out."
21418,Homer,"oh, so now it's we, eh."

21533,Homer,"oh, what's the point?"
21540,Homer,"this better work, boy. i don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm."

21587,Homer,... and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead. some kind of scary telephone i guess. or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell.
21590,Homer,and i'm starting right now. no more lousy pajamas!
21593,Homer,"yes, you did. i remember your exact words. you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house."
21596,Homer,"what? eh. eh. let me handle the creative end of this, marge. you don't understand how the creative mind works like i do."
21601,Homer,shutup.
21612,Homer,hamburger earmuffs!
21613,Homer,"thanks, sucker!"
21617,Homer,probably needs to be more powerful.
21626,Homer,women will like what i tell them to like. now here's something for everyone.
21634,Homer,"oh, that. i stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff."

21758,Homer,"mmmm. ugh, pesticides! carbomate, if i'm not mistaken. yep, carbomate."
21762,Homer,"yep. that's where they cook up their ""vittles."""
21769,Homer,skier?
21777,Homer,"higher, i say! i want to soar higher than any man has ever soared! i want to look down on the clouds with contempt! i want to sneer at god's creation and spit on his -- uh-oh."
21778,Homer,"oh, this is not good."
21781,Homer,"sorry, lady. i know you. you're kim basinger"

21829,Homer,who the hell are you?
21831,Homer,unbelievable?
21833,Homer,uh-oh.
21840,Homer,"when kim makes a manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. and would it kill you to put some fennel in it?"
21843,Homer,our dog isn't famous. and you kids aren't exactly john and joan cusack. and you. you couldn't open a movie if your life depended on it. i'm about ready to ankle this family.

21861,Homer,"well, i'll always have my crank calls. hello, old lady from ""titanic""? you stink!"
21867,Homer,"well, that settles it. for all those reasons and more, let us choose an electrifying career in... line."
21869,Homer,"pretty good, huh?"
21870,Homer,"well, there were script problems from day one."
21872,Homer,"i didn't choose to be a gifted actor, marge. it chose me. i'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. now help me make up some phony credits."
21882,Homer,"lather, rinse, and repeat. always repeat."
21883,Homer,"wow, i could have lived like that?"
21892,Homer,"your potato? you can't like own a potato, man. it's one of mother earth's creatures."

22019,Homer,"a kidney? okay, fine."

22034,Homer,"but i don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. why didn't somebody tell me what i was volunteering for? this is everybody's fault but mine."
22035,Homer,i owe dad so much. those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word.
22041,Homer,oh.
22043,Homer,i'm not worthy to live among civilized people.
22062,Homer,even the sea won't forgive me.
22063,Homer,"oh, i wish i had that kind of relationship with my father... or my kids. well, i guess it's up to me to take the first step."

22127,Homer,"relax, you're in good hands. now come on, i'll pull you up."
22128,Homer,"ooh, the mafia guy's all mad. oh, what are you gonna do? call your godfather? huh? ooh, godfather. break it down!"

22180,Homer,"well, well, well. so flawless flanders needs help from stinky-pants simpson."

22401,Homer,i can't understand what happened. why did they change homer simpson's character from cool to stupid?
22402,Homer,that does it! there's only one thing i can do.
22403,Homer,i wish i hadn't bought a hundred of these.
22406,Homer,"fine. i'll be in the car, driving home."
22418,Homer,"yeah, but why does the homer simpson character have to be so stupid?"
22421,Homer,then i'd like to legally change my name.
22424,Homer,"that's the way max power is, marge. decisive, uncompromising, and rude."
22426,Homer,"oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off."
22427,Homer,nobody snuggles with max power. you strap yourself in and feel the g's.
22434,Homer,"max power doesn't abbreviate. each letter is as important as the one that preceded it. maybe more important. no, as important."
22443,Homer,he's max power's oldest and dearest friend.
22450,Homer,and i counted the pennies in the ashtray.

22482,Homer,"and then the handsome prince realized he had to go to the bathroom really bad. but the evil ogre, barney, had left the men's room in the most wicked condition. so the prince went out back to the enchanted alley..."
22484,Homer,"i'm never eatin' chili again. ooh, chili!"

22587,Homer,"i'd like to read the following statement, but i do so under my own free will. it has come to my attention that nbc sucks. i apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many fox shows as possible. so in summary, nbc bad, fox good. cbs great."
22588,Homer,"19-- 1939?! oh my god, i've gone back in time!"
22589,Homer,i've got to warn everybody about hitler! and get to the ice cream store!
22590,Homer,shut up! you haven't even been born yet.

22645,Homer,"give it a try, honey."
22650,Homer,"i'm sorry, lisa. oh, it's not your fault. i know we love each other, dad, but we're two very different people. and, much as i hate to say it, as time goes on, we'll probably just drift further and further apart."

23230,Homer,oh... marge!
23231,Homer,really? with butterscotch on it?
23232,Homer,"marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ever given her husband."
23242,Homer,after we trusted you...
23245,Homer,"we should have paid more attention to these side-effects. it's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea..."
23248,Homer,i'm on top of it.
23250,Homer,why don't you just tell everybody?
23252,Homer,and mark mcgwire gave you an autographed bat.
23258,Homer,here we are kids -- the zoo.
23267,Homer,sorry.
23274,Homer,"no, no, you're right. it's a joke. everyone laugh at the funny joke . i'll be right back with the real review."
23275,Homer,still not clean! stink of failure still on me!
23284,Homer,woo hoo! stop the presses!
23290,Homer,welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. but this is only the beginning...
23294,Homer,and the view is... beautiful... inspirational... nauseating.
23301,Homer,"for you, perhaps."
23303,Homer,it lost some points 'cause it had a hot wheel on it.
23307,Homer,the other critics told me to be mean. and you should always give in to peer pressure.
23314,Homer,"people change, marge. my palate has grown more sophisticated."
23318,Homer,"nobody talks to me that way! i'm homer simpson! the most powerful food critic in town, who will never get his comeuppance! you hear me? no comeuppance! we'll be right back."
23325,Homer,"oh, marge, something bad usually happens to me when i go in anywhere."
23327,Homer,"so what are you up to, young lady?"
23332,Homer,"oh, so full... bellybutton moving from innie to outie..."

23343,Homer,he's dead!
23345,Homer,"don't worry. i've got a plan. okay, ned, the first thing we have to do is..."
23354,Homer,try not to look too sad -- it'll seem suspicious.
23356,Homer,"oh, wait... what i'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife."
23357,Homer,"we'll miss you, buddy."
23358,Homer,"hey, we just got away with murder. and it was so easy."
23366,Homer,"lisa, the pet cemetery."
23373,Homer,"flanders, stop that."
23376,Homer,absolutely.
23380,Homer,"well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. let's just have some milk and go to bed..."

23504,Homer,"yes, it's the latest craze. try some, won't you?"
23515,Homer,they'll be back. we control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from...
23525,Homer,"no, i'd rather die!"
23532,Homer,"hey, are we duellin' or what?"
23534,Homer,after pie.
23541,Homer,oh sure. single me out.

23592,Homer,"lisa, i know what's going on here. they did it to jesus and now they're doing it to me."
23597,Homer,mm-hmmm.

23605,Homer,"oooh, morlocks... chuds... mole people!"
23607,Homer,"not anymore, ron. now, i'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. something noble, but easy."
23609,Homer,that's it! kids are the answer! i'll dedicate my life to my children.
23610,Homer,no. i don't want your pity or your money.
23621,Homer,"ow! ow, that hurts! owww! ohhh!"
23630,Homer,"see, maggie. the ocean is just like a bathtub. except instead of rubber ducks, it has barracudas and moray eels."
23634,Homer,maggie! call aquaman!
23635,Homer,"maggie, you're swimming! you swam out to save me."
23640,Homer,"good girl, maggie. you knocked down all the pins. but you stepped over the line just a little bit, so i'll have to give you a five."
23642,Homer,"looks like daddy won, but two ninety-five is awfully good for a baby."
23649,Homer,"pay up, marge."
23652,Homer,"whoa, too much information! thanks for the mental picture. why don't you tell us what you really think?"
23653,Homer,"could you be any more...? hel-lo! look, just give me some ice cream."

23673,Homer,"ooh, look at that. ooh, gingerbread house. hansel and gretel are set for life."
23678,Homer,"apu? manjula? marge, i've got a bad feeling about this."
23679,Homer,marge... they've turned into jerks.
23680,Homer,"no, marge. no!"

23700,Homer,i don't know how.
23702,Homer,a gang! that's the answer.
23710,Homer,"the first meeting of ""hell's satans"" is called to order."
23712,Homer,"can't hassle us, pig. we're goin' the speed limit. oink, oink, oink."
23718,Homer,carl looks great. can't take a bad picture of that guy.
23720,Homer,you're the hell's satans? what a fun coincidence. my gang's name is also the...

23833,Homer,"here you go, lad."
23834,Homer,so you're shunning us.
23838,Homer,really? the whole beach?
23840,Homer,i figured it out after i ate one of my chest sores.
23842,Homer,"come on, loosen up. this is paradise."
23843,Homer,that's me!
23850,Homer,"my old dorm room. come on, baby, let's matriculate."

23899,Homer,"please, bart. you've gotta use your powers! i'm beggin' ya!"
23925,Homer,"just a second, marge. hello! thailand? how's everything on your end? uh-huh. that's some language you got there. and you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh?"
23933,Homer,"mmmm, danish."
23936,Homer,"what's that, a theme park?"
23937,Homer,"they were so drunk. gentlemen, get off your knees. your rich uncle homer is throwing the wildest box social the high seas have ever seen!"
23947,Homer,there are no laws. we can do anything we want! anything!
23949,Homer,look at those poor saps back on land. with their laws and ethics. they'll never know the simple joys of a monkey knife fight.
23950,Homer,"c'mon, bart. the coast guard is covering the doobs!"
23955,Homer,"help, pirates!"
23965,Homer,"shut up, net face."
23969,Homer,"they're the greatest heroes of all. hey, something's clawing at my leg. okay, it stopped."
23983,Homer,"get to the ""workin' overtime"" part!"
23989,Homer,"see, marge? i told you they could deep-fry my shirt."
24000,Homer,now for the actual horse whispering.
24010,Homer,"well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. we're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. all those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies."
24018,Homer,what is this place?!
24023,Homer,and what if i refuse to lose?
24025,Homer,did that really happen? or was it just a wonderful dream?
24028,Homer,"well, it is a good life, believe me... all right, we'll give it a shot. i'll deal with those murderous trolls."
24029,Homer,"i mean, i'll deal with those murderous trolls."
24036,Homer,"now that you're a champion, you'll have your pick of the fillies."
24045,Homer,we can hike anytime. this is our chance to see cars driving.
24047,Homer,"be patient, son. a rushed car never crashes."
24058,Homer,i know. no more being a jerk.
24062,Homer,"those feelings are normal, ned. they're part of the process. watch the sprinkler."
24070,Homer,"now, now, now. don't beat yourself up. i'm the one who drove her out of her seat. i'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts. i'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation..."
24071,Homer,"but, uh, there's no point in playing the blame game."
24074,Homer,you'll see...
24076,Homer,"okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot of flanders paying his bills..."
24077,Homer,then we star-wipe to flanders brushing his...
24093,Homer,"...step up to the best. ned flanders, the man with the chest."
24103,Homer,"marge, we're trying to help ned."
24116,Homer,"oh, why did i register with insta-trace?"
24117,Homer,"uh-oh. you've gotta help me, bart."
24122,Homer,"well, then we've got a problem. the banks are closed by now."
24137,Homer,"sure, sure, bob's your uncle. let's just get outta here!"
24138,Homer,"great, but why am i on a plane?"
24142,Homer,"jebus, where are you?! homer to jebus!"
24145,Homer,"you're leaving? wait, what do i do here?"
24156,Homer,"i'm gonna call you lisa junior. so, what do you do for fun around here?"
24161,Homer,"oh, god! oh, god! oh, god! oh, god!"
24165,Homer,"i guess so, but that first month was pretty rough."
24166,Homer,"really? without tv, it's hard to know when one day begins and the other ends."
24168,Homer,"yes, boy?"
24175,Homer,"like this, from the book of p-salms: ""god will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who walk in their guilty ways. that you may bathe your feet in blood."" as true today as it was when it was written."
24176,Homer,"now, let's open it up to some q & a."
24191,Homer,"so, how you doin'? stayin' out of trouble?"
24196,Homer,is everybody happyyyyy?

24213,Homer,"ahhh, you can really taste the goat."
24216,Homer,that one.
24218,Homer,just kidding. remember my face.
24222,Homer,"c'mon, moe. don't feel bad. there's too much emphasis on looks these days. that's why they won't let bill maher on tv before midnight."
24226,Homer,"yeah, but just for a minute. it's a funny story; i'll tell you sometime."
24235,Homer,"that was amazing, moe. i'm actually a little turned on."
24237,Homer,the one with the amulet?
24249,Homer,"let's see... judging from the bug build-up, we're gettin' close."
24250,Homer,what?
24257,Homer,"hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya."
24282,Homer,"shh, quiet."
24295,Homer,"barney, didn't you say you were gonna stop drinking?"
24297,Homer,"ah, man that's sweet. okay, let's go."
24300,Homer,not a chance. i can sink way lower. i just came to help my friend barney.
24302,Homer,i don't wanna walk that far. anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing. get it? huh? twelve? steps.
24317,Homer,"lenny and carl suck. please don't tell lenny and carl i said that, 'cause if i ever lost them as friends..."
24318,Homer,"oh, why can't i have a nickname?"
24322,Homer,that i will.
24342,Homer,stay away from my wife!
24346,Homer,you can't prove i did it.
24348,Homer,yeah. so what do you call this stuff?
24350,Homer,...and three makes three.
24363,Homer,"okay. ""there's a black widow at your door, a rattlesnake at the window, and a scorpion on the phone. do you a) none of the below, b)..."""
24371,Homer,"i'm not crazy. it's the tv that's crazy. aren't you, tv?"
24372,Homer,you see? gibberish. all gibberish.
24375,Homer,sometimes. but the guy i really hate is your father.
24378,Homer,florida? but that's america's wang.
24387,Homer,"oh, no, it's a lost child! don't worry, folks. i'll tackle him."
24397,Homer,"my insomnia, it's gone! check it out, marge. i'm sane again! and i owe it all to... spring break!"
24400,Homer,fine. be nerds. i'll find some people who know the true meaning of the words par-tay.
24401,Homer,we built this city / this kick-ass city / what kind of music built this city?
24416,Homer,"yeah, but first i talked to the engineer. he said there's a procedure for dealing with events of this nature."
24421,Homer,"more hashbrowns, sugar?"
24426,Homer,"you know, killing that gator was the best decision i ever made."
24433,Homer,son of a--! and the gentleman? damn it!
24440,Homer,nah. i want to enjoy this show before the network retools it.

24462,Homer,"yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off!"
24471,Homer,ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow!
24473,Homer,"oh, that's just superstition."
24479,Homer,what are these things in the mashed potatoes?
24480,Homer,"no! oh, becky, your potatoes are the best i've ever had."
24492,Homer,"our favorite show was ""hollywood hogwash."" but we also loved ""the dreck squad""..."
24506,Homer,and that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags.
24509,Homer,everything was goin' great at first. i felt like i was king of the world.
24510,Homer,i'm king of the world! woo hoo! woo hoo!
24515,Homer,"hey, they can't take our house. my pot-bellied pig is in there."
24516,Homer,"ohhhh, mister. porky."
24519,Homer,"no, something that rocks. that's the sound of today."
24529,Homer,"so, uh, how's everybody doing?"
24534,Homer,"we put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to what matters: the show, and the sunday comic strip."
24537,Homer,this'll be the last season.
24545,Homer,cloopid blore-apope!
24550,Homer,"well, the thing about that is..."
24551,Homer,"i'm sorry, i didn't get the number of hours or good deeds."
24552,Homer,"let's see, good deed..."
24557,Homer,"hey, i thought you guys could see everything."
24558,Homer,well i'll be damned.
24565,Homer,really?
24570,Homer,"boy, dumping your kids in the forest sure gets your hands dusty."
24574,Homer,"oh, rescue you, stuff myself with candy... it's all good."
24576,Homer,"mmmm, fish. oh no, that's me!"
24577,Homer,almost. just give her another twenty minutes.
24579,Homer,"... two krusty shakes, a donut burger with cheese and a party-size bucket of flan."
24581,Homer,anything to get out of work.
24586,Homer,uh-oh.
24592,Homer,milhouse? milhouse?
24595,Homer,great idea. then we should call the doctor about this.
24599,Homer,"oh, if only it were that easy, marge."
24602,Homer,i hate this new area code. like i don't have enough to remember already.
24603,Homer,"don't you miss the old 636, carl?"
24611,Homer,good idea.
24623,Homer,"okay, plan b. fellow 9-3-9'ers, i say we break off and form our own city!"
24624,Homer,now who's stupid?
24626,Homer,keep walkin'
24634,Homer,stop right there.
24637,Homer,that'll play great in the sticks.
24640,Homer,"oh yeah? they think they're better than us, huh? bart, c'mere a minute."
24650,Homer,"loyal citizens of new springfield. you stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools, and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all."
24652,Homer,stop streaming over the wall! at least wait till i'm through talking.
24653,Homer,"okay, now as for food, the following breeds of dog are edible..."
24658,Homer,"anyhow, those rats'll come crawling back..."
24662,Homer,uh...
24678,Homer,ha-ha. you hit the tire fire! you'll have to do...
24692,Homer,"oop, wait a minute..."
24696,Homer,"uh, honey, there's a point in every father's life when he blows up his daughter's room."
24698,Homer,"oh, come on. tell us how we can make it up to you. hey, pretend it's your birthday."
24699,Homer,anything at all. you name it. what do you want to do?
24710,Homer,can we make this hand high-low?
24726,Homer,ow! that bullet went in.
24730,Homer,"no, of course not."
24747,Homer,"oh, praise god, you're alive! unless..."
24748,Homer,"oh, must hide lisa...!"
24750,Homer,"grieving father, comin' through..."
24753,Homer,"oh, here we go."
24765,Homer,i had to sell it for gas money.
24771,Homer,consider it done.
24773,Homer,"yes, go on..."
24777,Homer,mr. burns... i was wondering if i could get a raise.

26342,Homer,"here's to a happy, well-rested marge!"
26343,Homer,unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.
26344,Homer,what's goin' on?
26347,Homer,"it's like being married to my best friend, and he lets me feel his boobs."
26349,Homer,"hey marge, i just thought of something."
26354,Homer,"oh, i'm so sorry."
26365,Homer,"oh my god, it's our high school prom! and once again i have no date!"

26389,Homer,"i gotta hand it to artie ziff, marge. that little nerd saved my life."
26395,Homer,"ten-four, princess. is that your beer tent?"
26400,Homer,"hey marge, watch me burn flanders. ned flanders bids fifty dollars."
26401,Homer,"don't worry, honey. we can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, i promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is."
26405,Homer,"look, boy. here's my advice on women: don't give them nicknames like ""jumbo"" or ""boxcar"" and always get receipts -- it makes you look like a business guy..."
26407,Homer,"wow, what kind of mileage does it get?"
26408,Homer,"yeah, one time, she-- oh, she's looking at us. be cool."
26409,Homer,"hello, gentlemen. would you care to meet my new best friend..."

26439,Homer,one of the wheels broke off my chair today. but i didn't make a movie about it.
26442,Homer,"oh, listen to you. ""ooh, ooh, i'm too old to change. "" how old are you?"
26445,Homer,"bart, i couldn't help noticing buck is a total fraud. so i took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall."
26448,Homer,my son lost his hero. this should be the greatest night of my life. how come i'm not happy?
26452,Homer,i'm still not givin' up on buck. there must be some hare-brained half-assed way...
26453,Homer,get me buck mccoy.
26454,Homer,here you go. just stop this bank robbery and you'll be a hero again. i'll wait in the car.
26459,Homer,aren't you forgettin' someone?

26487,Homer,"no, he's gotta learn, marge. the way my dad made me learn."
26492,Homer,ever!
26493,Homer,"oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father."
26507,Homer,"anyway, over torture, one of your soldiers mentioned that you collect giant wooden animals. we hope you don't have a horse."
26512,Homer,"gentlemen, i must be wasted, 'cause it looks like that cloud is mad at me."
26523,Homer,"oh, i'm sorry i was gone so long. but i'm gonna do something i haven't done for twenty years -- take out the trash."
26527,Homer,"this one takes place in a make-believe kingdom called ""france..."""
26529,Homer,"son, how's it going with the breakfast pâté?"
26531,Homer,burn this guy! he lost our good bucket!
26533,Homer,"our next story is ""hamlet,"" by william shakespeare."
26534,Homer,"i don't know, but that would be hot. ""once upon a time there was a young prince of denmark."""
26535,Homer,it's cold outside. you'll need a sweater. a sweater!
26538,Homer,i'm pretty sure it wasn't.
26544,Homer,"marge, it's called negotiating."
26559,Homer,don't you know the boys from brazil are little hitlers? i saw it in a movie. whose name i can't remember.
26562,Homer,"oh, that poor little boy. we've got to find him."
26566,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. so in august... it's cold?"
26576,Homer,"i got it, i got, i got it."
26577,Homer,"hey, and a mini-bar hat."
26586,Homer,does that include tip?
26587,Homer,how did you know?!
26588,Homer,"mine keeps disappearing. oh, well."
26593,Homer,ahhh...
26597,Homer,woo hoo!
26602,Homer,i'll regroup at red lobster!
26605,Homer,"so lisa says by killing their enemy, i became the alpha-crow."
26606,Homer,"i'm sure he'll turn up. look, here's one of his buttons."
26610,Homer,"awww, look, maggie wants to fly too."
26613,Homer,"okay, that was not cool. we need to lay down some ground rules--"
26615,Homer,"all right, that's it. shoo, you stupid crows! shoo! shoo! shoo!"
26621,Homer,"look, man. i don't do drugs."
26627,Homer,"they burned down the gambling house - it died with an awful sound / i am hungry for a can-dy bar / i think i'll eat a ""mounds""..."
26630,Homer,"marge, i just realized: i am the ""ow"" in the word ""now"". and if you tell anyone..."
26637,Homer,"""could jesus microwave a burrito so hot, that he himself could not eat it?"""
26643,Homer,"oops! i thought this was the can, man."
26646,Homer,hardly working...
26651,Homer,"and ""otto"" is ""otto"" backwards."
26654,Homer,"good afternoon. i want to thank you all for coming down here, taking time off from your jobs..."
26655,Homer,'cause we need to keep medical marijuana legal!
26658,Homer,"oh man, they already voted. and we lost!"
26660,Homer,"well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands."
26665,Homer,never!
26676,Homer,you mean that guy on 60 minutes who yells all the time?
26681,Homer,"mr. burns, as we're running long, may we skip your speech and go directly to the questions?"
26685,Homer,mr. burns has left the building!
26688,Homer,waiting for my wife. she has a surprise for me.
26697,Homer,"ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together..."
26703,Homer,i'm sick of your lies. secrets and lies. it's always secrets and lies.
26713,Homer,"oh, i've been there, man."
26716,Homer,that guy's hilarious. i especially like his white shirt and blue pants. wait a second... angry dad is me!
26720,Homer,"stop it! the more you rock, the angrier i get!"
26725,Homer,i'm just passionate -- like all us greeks.
26746,Homer,stop it now.
26750,Homer,"oh my god! i know you must get this all the time, but can i suggest a flavor?"
26761,Homer,"now apu, when you gave me this keg it had dents. and here's proof."
26770,Homer,"dirty love. i mean, thirty love. i mean, anyone for penis? i'll just get the shuttlecock."
26772,Homer,why don't you play this?
26773,Homer,"marge, why are you crying? you're not in any physical pain. the only kind of pain a man can understand."
26787,Homer,and krusty. we gotta invite krusty.
26795,Homer,it's been on my list for a long time.
26801,Homer,"well, hookers and spiderman."
26808,Homer,"that's it, boy! it's time for your bath!"
26811,Homer,"good night, bart."
26814,Homer,"cherish these moments, homer."
26815,Homer,what the-- you earned how many credits without our permission?
26817,Homer,"oh sure, when a man does it, it's smutty. but if a woman did it--"
26818,Homer,"oh, come on--"
26819,Homer,you're right.
26820,Homer,"i was trying to throw bart over the roof, and he got stuck in this tree."
26821,Homer,"marge, where's my pellet gun?"
26827,Homer,"hey, hey, hey, no peeking."
26828,Homer,"happy anniversary, marge!"
26832,Homer,finish the job.
26840,Homer,woo hoo! he's alive. now you can't punish me.
26842,Homer,"uh, they discontinued the cobbler."
26844,Homer,safe and sound.
26851,Homer,"yeah, i've gotten a lot of compliments about my talking."
26856,Homer,cover for me.
26859,Homer,laxative?
26861,Homer,are you all right?
26864,Homer,buh... guh... muh... wuh. zuh.
26867,Homer,"now if you'll excuse us, we'll just be... does that ever work?"
26870,Homer,"oh man, what a day. i'd kill for a beer."
26876,Homer,mrs. bellamy's necklace!
26878,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i'll cut us a deal by becoming a jailhouse snitch. i know who stopped up the toilet!"
26880,Homer,let's just say i'm planning a little surprise for the execution. this cannon is going to be full when i go off. ka-boom!
26896,Homer,a blackout?! every time santa and i get together it's a disaster.
26899,Homer,no.
26902,Homer,"you've got to set limits, marge."
26903,Homer,yeah. wiggum couldn't catch cooties at milhouse's birthday party.
26904,Homer,"oh. seriously, everyone says your parties rock."
26906,Homer,wrong answer.
26913,Homer,you're right. what's this?
26914,Homer,a cap!
26916,Homer,do you sell hats?
26917,Homer,to people?
26926,Homer,"you know, i've had a lot of jobs: boxer, mascot, astronaut, imitation krusty, baby proofer, trucker, hippy, plow driver, food critic, conceptual artist, grease salesman, carny, mayor, grifter, bodyguard for the mayor, country western manager, garbage commissioner, mountain climber, farmer, inventor, smithers, poochie, celebrity assistant, power plant worker, fortune cookie writer, beer baron, kwik-e-mart clerk, homophobe, and missionary. but protecting springfield, that gives me the best feeling of all."
26927,Homer,"finally, a way to combine my love of helping people with my love of hurting people."
26930,Homer,you'll do as i say or i'll have your badges. once i make and give you your badges.
26931,Homer,"flanders, i was able to find your missing leaf blower, belt sander and morning newspapers."
26932,Homer,who said it was a he?
26955,Homer,"i don't get it. i finally did a job where i wasn't lazy, stupid, or corrupt -- and now i'm gonna get killed for it."
26963,Homer,were they now?
26970,Homer,you wanna be my slave?
26982,Homer,"i mean, four!"
26987,Homer,"ohh, i gotta get rid of these guys."
26988,Homer,"now before i abandon you in this cornfield, does anyone remember the way home?"
26991,Homer,"okay, everyone out!"
26996,Homer,we're out of donuts!
26997,Homer,good news.
27002,Homer,gimme!
27003,Homer,"hear me, people of the past!"
27022,Homer,what's that?
27031,Homer,"hi, moe, got any beer?"
27034,Homer,and you can live with that.
27053,Homer,couldn't you come up with a less embarrassing lie?
27060,Homer,that my family isn't the center of my universe? are you nuts?
27061,Homer,"oh, i can't believe they took ""monkey trauma center"" off for this."
27072,Homer,"you guys are the best. i love you, i love you, i love you..."
27081,Homer,"uh-huh. now i'm afraid that if i stop talking, i'll die. isn't mick cool? i thought he'd be all like, ""i'm a rock star. aren't i great?"" but he's just like you or me or jesus over there."
27089,Homer,"baby, baby, baby, baby!"
27115,Homer,all-access.
27116,Homer,all-access.
27117,Homer,"and after the show, you can come backstage for pizza and pop."
27121,Homer,i'm ready. just give me a guitar. how many solos should i do? four?
27123,Homer,my official tour jacket!
27130,Homer,test one-test two-test three-test four you test me like the water in el salvador...
27134,Homer,"there's no need for apologies, guys. you're rock stars! you're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail."
27137,Homer,"have fun at school, kids."
27139,Homer,i hate reality shows...
27140,Homer,"i've grown, you haven't."
27141,Homer,"i can't take any more of these shows. if i wanted reality, i'd finally have this lump looked at."
27144,Homer,"come on, kids. daddy knows a way to get the money... with no risk."
27145,Homer,woo hoo!
27162,Homer,"well, he's not gonna get very far without that."
27163,Homer,"bart, is that you?"
27165,Homer,dew-ey! dew-ey! dew-ey!
27179,Homer,"aw, it sounds like all you're looking for is a little reassurance. well..."
27184,Homer,explain later!
27186,Homer,"yeah, he truly is a monster. hey, let's go out to dinner tomorrow. just you, me, the kids and the twins. whadaya say?"
27187,Homer,"well, that cinches it. lisa gets the prize for the best off-the-cuff response."
27190,Homer,and they're all mine...
27191,Homer,uh... i was gettin' around to it.
27193,Homer,no dice. take your fun and adventure outside.
27197,Homer,"gentlemen, say hello to springfield's newest supermodel!"
27201,Homer,"kids, i'd like to reintroduce you to classic marge."
27202,Homer,"not at all, sweetie. at least one of us should be able to put their arms around the other one."
27210,Homer,why can't they just be happy for my success?
27219,Homer,"eh, that was boring. let's get a hotel."
27220,Homer,stupid bran producer's convention.
27226,Homer,"it's not a time machine, moe."
27229,Homer,where's that kid with my latte?!
27230,Homer,"he's not coming, is he? is he?"
27241,Homer,this comes off.
27245,Homer,"oh, i wish you would reconsider the proposal of hiram beatwife."
27247,Homer,lisa! explain!
27248,Homer,marge! throw me an old-timey rope in an old-timey way!
27253,Homer,i can't remember the last time i cried like this.
27270,Homer,"the ""george foreman mail sorter"" will let us know."
27273,Homer,do not use steam room if you are overweight or have a heart condition.
27276,Homer,"triple, no. definitely no."
27277,Homer,"so, which one of these psychos is gonna help me catch my killer?"
27281,Homer,"hmm... well, there's mr. burns, fat tony, the emperor of japan, ex-president bush."
27286,Homer,"mardi gras, eh? didn't last year's king have to abdicate because he married a commoner?"
27294,Homer,once i kill you everyone will think i'm the real homer!
27302,Homer,"nonetheless, the people have spoken."
27314,Homer,"well, duh."
27317,Homer,"hey, i know you. you're my mechanic, junior."
27320,Homer,oh yeah. how is old grimey?
27323,Homer,"yeah, it's every parent's dream to outlive their children. goodnight, son."
27328,Homer,mm... trophy.
27332,Homer,it's even boring to fly over it!
27334,Homer,let's go make some fireworks of our own.
27337,Homer,"oh, you mean the enron ride. let's go."
27340,Homer,michael jackson just told me to shut up!
27344,Homer,"one churro, please."
27352,Homer,"one turbo diary, please."
27353,Homer,now what am i gonna get lisa?
27356,Homer,"hey, your kid is in the movie -- and the movie knows his name. maybe lisa will like this better than the diary. stupid flanders, you're a genius!"
27358,Homer,"well, yes and no."
27359,Homer,mostly no.
27366,Homer,i did it for the insurance money.
27371,Homer,drunk cop? is that you?
27376,Homer,"i need you to find out everything about my daughter, so she'll think i'm a good dad."
27381,Homer,"ah, the information i've been waiting for."
27382,Homer,you should know. it is your favorite album.
27387,Homer,"well, we should get along. i mean after all, i am your... ...father."
27389,Homer,"uh, report is a daddy word that means ""loves his daughter."""
27395,Homer,i can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.
27400,Homer,"uh, rock strongo."
27401,Homer,"uh, lance uppercut."
27405,Homer,"oh, marge. you're not gettin' it, it's me. homer. simpson."
27415,Homer,we'll just tell the police and then i'm back to being plain old rock strongo.
27416,Homer,dexter colt. the man who framed my daughter.
27421,Homer,"oh, lisa has excellent hearing. once when she was three, i was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!"
27434,Homer,i'll take it.
27437,Homer,do you think you could give me a lift home?
27438,Homer,your heartbeat is so soothing.
27448,Homer,"yep, but you're still safe at home. after a few practice trips here, the real kwik-e-mart will be a piece of cake. now, bart will play apu..."
27449,Homer,"look, i'm the first to admit it. i don't write good parts for women."
27457,Homer,"bart, eat your spinach."
27458,Homer,yes way!
27469,Homer,"quiet, her muscular ears can hear us."
27472,Homer,denser?!
27488,Homer,they thought of everything! how come all the good things happen to jesus h. nice? by which i mean flanders!
27489,Homer,the grass is actually greener on flanders' side.
27493,Homer,"ugh, where's the remote?"
27496,Homer,"o, merciful god, who has blessed mankind with two kinds of clam chowder, help me find the remote."
27511,Homer,"well, we could live with a stopped-up drain."
27512,Homer,you was hiding behind the drywall. yes you were! i'm glad social services didn't see this. yes i am!
27519,Homer,"woo-hoo! can i get that in lottery tickets, please?"
27531,Homer,"you're right, marge. i'll make it up to them. by throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!"
27546,Homer,"i know this looks bad, but if you reverse it, daddy's a hero!"
27551,Homer,"yes, son. at times like this i just look at my bracelet."
27552,Homer,jesus?! i thought it was gepetto!
27553,Homer,who is it?
27555,Homer,is it crispy?
27556,Homer,but not too crispy.
27558,Homer,emancipated? don't you like being a dude?
27559,Homer,"hey, my dad was lousy and i didn't sue him. i just dumped him in the cheapest home i could find."
27563,Homer,"son, i just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, i'm gonna be the best dad i can."
27567,Homer,i'll show you worse!
27569,Homer,"go ahead, leave. you'll come crawling back."
27572,Homer,"look out, son. this one's got a little mustard on it!"
27574,Homer,"of all the sites on all the web, i had to click onto his."
27575,Homer,"did you see that, boy? your mom thinks you're still here!"
27578,Homer,what the-- where the hell is my sugar?!
27579,Homer,"hello, son. you're looking well."
27582,Homer,"you know son, i've been doing a lot of thinking. i was wrong to exploit you, and i won't do it again."
27586,Homer,sorry. i just wanna win my son back so badly.
27591,Homer,not very!
27594,Homer,"woo hoo! i rule this pseudo sport! come back to me, boy!"
27598,Homer,anything... as long as i can give the money to my son.
27601,Homer,what did they say about my scalp?
27603,Homer,"wow, i can't wait to pack that into my colon."
27612,Homer,"hey, who doesn't?"
27616,Homer,"not again! first you took away my philly fudge steak, and then my bacon balls, then my whatcha-ma-chicken. you monster!"
27629,Homer,"daddy made it for your dance recital, honey!"
27631,Homer,"yeah, you're the number one speller in this car or in that car or in that car or, don't look at that car."
27633,Homer,"enough talk. dip me, my love."
27634,Homer,lower. lower!
27635,Homer,lower!
27638,Homer,ooh! lemme guess. skinner's mother. she sure knows how to swing it.
27648,Homer,"poor ned, gardening away his misery."
27650,Homer,uh-oh. here comes helen fielding.
27654,Homer,do - you - hear - a - noise?
27655,Homer,marge germs!
27659,Homer,i'm on my way. you man the rake.
27662,Homer,stay plugged in! i will find you!
27669,Homer,looks like we're in for nasty weather...
27672,Homer,"eh, i'm still undecided."
27681,Homer,how 'bout before?
27698,Homer,everyone but me.
27701,Homer,"that's it! thank you, outdoor advertising! you saved my marriage -- and not for the first time."
27709,Homer,"you're preaching to the choir, man."
27716,Homer,i don't wanna die! i'm so young.
27721,Homer,learn to talk!
27723,Homer,go on ahead. i'll just slow you down.
27728,Homer,and now to see mr. burns for the promotion and raise i've deserved since this morning.
27732,Homer,"ahhh, look at the little eels. electric eels!"
27734,Homer,"thanks for trying, but i'll be at moe's."
27739,Homer,wait'll he steps on this flaming bag of... lisa's college fund?!
27744,Homer,mr. burns! the nuclear regulatory commission is here for a surprise inspection!
27745,Homer,hello!
27749,Homer,"that's right. and as my first act... mr. burns, you're fired!"
27765,Homer,can't i water ski a little bit?
27767,Homer,"that's great, honey. hold it up to the camera."
27769,Homer,...best quality pork chops.
27770,Homer,"lisa, i deeply resent...with a big bowl of applesauce."
27775,Homer,bart's growing up without me. he won't be ten forever.
27777,Homer,"how did you ever run this place? you've gotta turn away your family, fire your friends, work until the wee hours of the afternoon..."
27780,Homer,what are you doin'?
27797,Homer,oh my god! space monsters are invading us!
27798,Homer,"oh. well, where do i twist this thing to make funny patterns?"
27812,Homer,"oh, i hate this. it's making me use my arms."
27821,Homer,"or when i messed up taping ""city slickers 2"" and cut off the end. was curly's gold just a legend?"
27823,Homer,"hey, what's this? ""marge's memory chest."""
27827,Homer,i can't believe how young we looked... in my memory.
27837,Homer,whatever.
27842,Homer,so you mean our whole marriage you've just been resenting me behind my back?
27845,Homer,"oh, i get it. your stupid husband is too ""drunk"" to do it right."
27846,Homer,"oh, so you don't like it when i drink. what other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?"
27849,Homer,now you're just making up rules. who made you judge judy and executioner?
27853,Homer,do i dare to go up? or is the love that waits behind that window just a lie?
27855,Homer,"""apartment finder: we put you in your place."" ""roommate wanted for three bedroom apartment. spacious, river view, only four hundred dollars a month!"" thank you, news box... it's gone!"
27856,Homer,what a well-kept street. and there sure are a lot of gay bookstores for a straight neighborhood.
27857,Homer,it's a cinch these guys never had any kids.
27860,Homer,"me too. i'm a member of this club where if i eat one more sub sandwich, i get a free sub sandwich. you probably saw the ads, with this guy who used to be fat, but now he's just ugly."
27862,Homer,"you are? hm, which will win out? my old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that i've already mixed my laundry with yours. i'll have to sleep on it."
27864,Homer,"calm down, picky ricardo. he made us a great breakfast, and you're just ridin' his butt... and not in a good way."
27865,Homer,"well, get used to it, 'cause i'm gonna stay."
27891,Homer,wow. wow. i never realized you felt about me that way. we should really take some time to talk and...i'd just end up hurting you!
27893,Homer,"oh, yeah. the night that destroyed my marriage."
27899,Homer,those suck. they're worse than nothing. i could write way better songs.
27903,Homer,"flanders, i am a patient, reasonable, handsome man. but even i have my limits. now beat it!"
27908,Homer,fine.
27920,Homer,sweet.
27922,Homer,this dude ranch is gonna be great -- a whole week without hearing that stupid song.
27929,Homer,deal. my brother...
27936,Homer,it's the beef hormones and the fluorescent lights. what are you gonna do?
27944,Homer,i still hate them. go back to pittsburgh!
27947,Homer,"woo hoo! in your face, imaginary guy!"
27950,Homer,only losers buy wood. we're going to nature's lumberyard.
27951,Homer,"it's okay, bart. this track has been abandoned since nineteen -- uh-oh."
27952,Homer,nothing beats flying across the country on a train.
27957,Homer,stop it!
27960,Homer,"watch your step... don't panic... by going down the ladder, you are agreeing not to sue."
27961,Homer,head burning... legs freezing. middle... very pleasant.
27963,Homer,"don't be scared, you can do it!"
27968,Homer,"but as for you, santa's little helper, you are a selfish coward and a bad dog!"
27980,Homer,sweet.
27990,Homer,everything is going according to plan. i'll just keep thrashing around like an injured seal.
27992,Homer,"i'm sorry i was ever mean to you. marge, prepare the celebration ham."
27998,Homer,"yeah, but he ate the last can of tuna."
28013,Homer,check. fog machine?
28016,Homer,oh my god! i've got to do something.
28030,Homer,"you know, all this walking is paying off -- look how healthy i am."
28033,Homer,"calm down, stresserella!"
28035,Homer,"marge, you don't know what you're saying!"
28049,Homer,i rarely feel the need to utter d'oh!
28051,Homer,i can walk from springfield to alaska / then hobnob with the stars in malibu...
28053,Homer,and when i hear...
28055,Homer,"oh, i love to perambulate / it's standing still i really hate / so let me please reiterate / i love to..."
28057,Homer,pretty good. thanks for asking.
28061,Homer,"yeah, the doctor says that soon my pelvis will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever."
28066,Homer,nothing could be farther from the...
28069,Homer,"there's homer... homer j. simpson... and commander cool, a/k/a me."
28070,Homer,"we've gotta help her. if marge isn't happy, i'm not happy. and if i'm not happy moe is very happy. but for once, this isn't about moe. what should i do, dr. hot dog?"
28076,Homer,you can bring a bag of ice.
28082,Homer,so you don't want to kill me anymore?
28088,Homer,"and now, to all my dear friends, i say... get the hell out of my yard."
28101,Homer,"without the talking stick, we don't hear you."
28108,Homer,"okay, bart. back up the truck."
28111,Homer,well i'm not finished. where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?
28112,Homer,"marge, remove that stitching."
28115,Homer,or did it?
28116,Homer,you talk pretty tough for a man without health insurance!
28117,Homer,"oh my god, that's my wife, and she's crying."
28127,Homer,noooooooooo!
28145,Homer,get out!
28148,Homer,it must have been moe!
28149,Homer,thank goodness.
28157,Homer,"you kids have got to learn that actions have consequences! eat fire, punks!"
28178,Homer,not this! anything but this!
28179,Homer,uh... what was that first one again?
28182,Homer,woo-hoo!
28188,Homer,hmm...
28190,Homer,it was those guys!
28196,Homer,this counts as a bath!
28198,Homer,"bart, you're not at school. don't swear!"
28215,Homer,wait a minute. this is today's paper. that meeting is tonight!
28224,Homer,"mom? you're back. just like you were back before, then you left me again. i love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. oh, what the heck."
28229,Homer,i made this when i was five. i had to do something -- your pencils were all over the place.
28231,Homer,fine.
28232,Homer,"mom, i swear on your eventual grave i will never, ever, let the police get their hands on you. uh-oh."
28234,Homer,"i barely know my mother. and every time i see her, she's taken away again. and when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me."
28237,Homer,woo hoo! i can be a little boy again!
28244,Homer,now get out of my house.
28248,Homer,candlepin bowling? that's a great idea. we'll play right after i break your grandmother out of prison.
28255,Homer,"geez, pal."
28257,Homer,"oh, stop it."
28263,Homer,brambles! briars!
28267,Homer,your last act as a mom was to make me a better dad. but at least now i'll never lose you again.
28280,Homer,you think i won't manhandle a little boy?!
28287,Homer,"oh, i'm so confused."
28296,Homer,i'unno. how 'bout a horse whisperer?
28302,Homer,can you describe the bill?
28303,Homer,it's bart's moon party from outer space...
28305,Homer,we've gone on plenty of great vacations.
28307,Homer,"well, i'd like to return to brazil. but i hear the monkey problem is even worse now."
28310,Homer,the place i was born is now a gator farm.
28312,Homer,"make with the tea, jeeves."
28317,Homer,"fish? i don't know, i'm not really a vegetarian..."
28319,Homer,that was over soccer results! can you believe they gave giggs a yellow card in the box?
28321,Homer,"now, now, let's just look... there's big ben, there's piccadilly circus, there's jimmy page, one of the greatest thieves of american black music who ever walked the earth. bup, there's the kids."
28323,Homer,what? what play?
28324,Homer,"you mean ""macbeth""?"
28327,Homer,"mr. macbeth, i'm really sorry."
28329,Homer,"yes, this trip is entirely uneventful."
28330,Homer,i see an opening.
28331,Homer,that's it. i'm acting the way america acts best -- unilaterally.
28346,Homer,"well marge, if i die here, there's one thing i want you to remember: don't buy any videotapes in england. they won't work in our vcr!"
28355,Homer,"but we americans are england's children. i know we don't call as often as we should, and we aren't as well-behaved as our goody two-shoes brother canada, who by the way has never had a girlfriend, i'm just sayin'."
28357,Homer,"see ya in atlanta, jerk!"
28362,Homer,"kids, we're going mother's day shopping! i'm glad this holiday only comes every four years."
28373,Homer,"marge, you're gonna love my present. it is so thoughtful it makes the kids' gifts look like crap."
28374,Homer,"whoa, marge, get a room!"
28391,Homer,hello? anyone home?
28397,Homer,"no, go ahead."
28402,Homer,lookin' good. and i did it all without wasting money on one of those stupid welder's masks.
28409,Homer,"marge, you awake? marge?"
28413,Homer,i never realized how hot this suit is. i'm sweating out all my blood-lust!
28418,Homer,"okay, it's probably the tag. but just to be sure..."
28424,Homer,"wrong again, liberal media."
28432,Homer,what can i say? i love nature...
28438,Homer,sweet.
28440,Homer,"oh god, it's baby blood!"
28443,Homer,"you just lost a box, pal!"
28445,Homer,"on our way to the clinic, i decided to give him a night his wang would never forget."
28448,Homer,"i can't neuter you, boy. not after all we've been through."
28449,Homer,"but from now on, you better save your lovin' for the couch cushions!"
28451,Homer,i'm your man!
28455,Homer,"why so formal, lenny? you're my go-to guy."
28467,Homer,"well, that's all over now. from now on, we will focus solely on important issues."
28473,Homer,"hey, where's my car?"
28480,Homer,"oh carl, you remembered i like tv!"
28482,Homer,"come on machine, take my dollar!"
28484,Homer,"here you go, lenny."
28486,Homer,oh c'mon... mr. burns is way more selfish.
28505,Homer,isn't it sufficient.
28506,Homer,uh... woo hoo! maggie's talking!
28509,Homer,"c'mon marge, i'm not the only selfish person. you have to get your hair done at ""supercuts."" i guess regular ""cuts"" just isn't good enough for you."
28515,Homer,i heard you the first five times.
28516,Homer,oh mcgrew. once again you've mistaken something for something!
28517,Homer,oh my god! it's like looking at a cartoon version of myself.
28518,Homer,"c'mon, death. leave mcgrew alone. take tiny tim."
28520,Homer,unloved by all! noooooooo!
28521,Homer,"children, children, what day is this?"
28524,Homer,"marge, tv and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson. from now on, i will stop being selfish and start being good. in fact, i'll be the nicest man in town."
28525,Homer,"yes, but this time i'm sober. ish."
28529,Homer,"look, lenny. i know i was a pretty bad secret santa, so i wanted to make it up to you."
28533,Homer,i'm not looking for glory or wealth. i'm just buying that stairway to heaven jesus sang of.
28536,Homer,"being unselfish is a natural high, like hiking or paint thinner."
28539,Homer,"here's your skates. oh, you'll have to take off those boots."
28546,Homer,"you're a hero, homer j. / you're as crafty as a skunk / they'll thank you in the morning for stealing flanders' junk / homer jaaaaay! / you're a double-bacon genius-burger... and just a little drunk."
28551,Homer,"let's just say that on this day, a million years ago, a dude was born who most of us think was magic, but others don't, and that's cool. but we're probably right. amen."
28552,Homer,"and now, i think the only thing left to do is -- return all your gifts! ned?"
28558,Homer,"whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop! whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!"
28563,Homer,"honey, this marriage is a partnership. when you fall, i pick you up. and when you can't finish a sandwich, i eat that sandwich."
28564,Homer,and i promise this rock is gonna weigh you down for the rest of your life.
28568,Homer,you've probably heard a lot of bad things about families come first.
28572,Homer,"""families come first"" is supported by lifelong springfieldians you know and trust like me, milhouse's dad, bumblebee man, surly duff, and that jerk that goes ""yeees!"""
28578,Homer,i am rudy giuliani. you must forgive homer. i am rudy giuliani. you must forgive homer. i am.
28579,Homer,what do i care?
28581,Homer,a ten-speed bike?! what did your mother say?
28584,Homer,that's right. no questions asked.
28585,Homer,"there, there. you're both right."
28587,Homer,"for true, son."
28590,Homer,i can make a bike. i made you.
28602,Homer,that's it!
28610,Homer,"i like you, son."
28615,Homer,oh no! my recurring nightmare is coming true!
28625,Homer,can you do my back?
28626,Homer,"bart, i'm sorry -- i could never build a robot this awesome. i'm a fraud."
28630,Homer,"hey, what gives? he's not killing me!"
28637,Homer,great. and i'll have a diet coke. deep fried.
28640,Homer,why don't i just pull over?
28642,Homer,oh no! i hit the grief counselor!
28655,Homer,"kids, kids. those aren't your toys. they're to keep daddy asleep and awake."
28659,Homer,"fine, fine. i'll take the kids tonight, and you go to your precious hair appointment."
28661,Homer,"where to, mack?"
28667,Homer,"oh good, you can use that to take down my dinner order. i'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice."
28672,Homer,no problem.
28676,Homer,"no! gotta read marge's book. can't get distracted. hm... ""distracted,"" that's a funny word. does anyone ever get ""tracted?"" let me call the suicide hotline and ask them."
28679,Homer,i did.
28681,Homer,"as i've always said: ""publish or perish""!"
28687,Homer,that one i got.
28689,Homer,the harpooned heart. book on tape! as read by mary-kate and ashley olsen.
28690,Homer,how can you write such horrible things about me?
28694,Homer,"well, i'll make sure you never imagine anything again."
28696,Homer,open this door right now!
28701,Homer,in marge's book i was so mean and you were so nice. how can i be more like you? just give me some advice.
28710,Homer,"rollin', rollin', rollin' / toxic barrel rollin'"
28711,Homer,"to old man burns, who's paying us to drink because we're embarrassing!"
28717,Homer,home sweet home. now to watch some tv.
28721,Homer,hm...
28725,Homer,"marge, i'm not gonna lie to you..."
28738,Homer,"hoo boy, are you in trouble."
28739,Homer,"when a woman says nothing's wrong that means everything's wrong. and when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. and when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off."
28740,Homer,wait 'til he puts his unsuspecting butt on that toilet seat.
28743,Homer,"butt on bowl, little man!"
28757,Homer,which one? tri-city? omni-pay? insta-threat? i've beaten 'em all!
28761,Homer,i'm taking you all out for tacos!
28772,Homer,"oh, i knew it!"
28776,Homer,damn it!
28781,Homer,how'd you get in here?
28785,Homer,i am so there!
28788,Homer,what would jesus view?
28789,Homer,"okay kids, forget the movie. we'll just go to the furniture store and sit down."
28791,Homer,"hey lenny, is your film appropriate for kids?"
28793,Homer,"hey, i paid for this popcorn and i'm eating it."
28796,Homer,"well, what do you know? it's unkillable."
28797,Homer,"honey, can daddy rest his soda on your head?"
28799,Homer,but scaring kids is good for them. it hardens them against future terrors -- like roofing and driveway scams.
28804,Homer,"that's it. it's one thing for a ghost to terrorize my children, but quite another for him to play my theremin."
28810,Homer,"c'mon, little fella. you're hangin' with me tonight."
28815,Homer,four jacks.
28816,Homer,check it out! i own a multi-national corporation. i always knew some day i'd be a c.o.d.
28826,Homer,can i apply my time toward a future crime?
28828,Homer,"oh bart, what a man you've become."
28831,Homer,"get your own, mooch."
28842,Homer,"hm, all right, we'll go on the winery tour. but you'll have to catch me first!"
28848,Homer,"oh honey, i love to hear you laugh."
28857,Homer,"you got it. and when i feel weak, i will draw strength from the bible."
28863,Homer,"yes, and you've said that several times now."
28866,Homer,what the?
28868,Homer,"in a minute, honey."
28870,Homer,"aw, this is a new low for me."
28873,Homer,that's my girl!
28878,Homer,"i can't talk to my wife for twenty-eight days? sir, she is not an alcoholic! you can't put me on hold! i'll put you on hold!"
28881,Homer,"flanders, can you watch my kids while i'm at the rehab clinic?"
28890,Homer,"no wonder they call it ""the good book."""
28894,Homer,"hey, i only drink that when i'm already drunk."
28902,Homer,"it's not all your fault. all these years, i watched you turn our son into a time bomb, and yet i did nothing. so in a way, i too am a victim... of you."
28908,Homer,put that sissy down!
28909,Homer,"if you're gonna pick on someone, why don't you pick on someone much bigger than you with a gun?"
28913,Homer,"see you monday. oh wait, monday's martin luther king day. i'll see ya when i see ya."
28914,Homer,love you.
28919,Homer,"son, i want you to know, no matter what anyone says, there's no shame in being caught alive."
28920,Homer,"gina, thanks for showing us the meaning of christmas."
28937,Homer,"yeah, he's crazy all right."
28939,Homer,wait a minute. i thought you didn't wanna get married.
28940,Homer,"don't worry, principal skinner."
28944,Homer,marge? are you helping her?
28949,Homer,"why did i take it off? oh, right. to see if i could skip it across lake michigan."
28957,Homer,that room has a dry erase board. they could be doing anything in there! anything.
28962,Homer,"marge, you just agreed to raise the kids klingon!"
28968,Homer,exactly.
28971,Homer,"yeah, we're tryin' to create a mood here, so shut the hell up!"
28972,Homer,"eh, well, i wouldn't be happy."
28980,Homer,we get one weekend to ourselves and we've gotta spend it watching some old geezer's odometer turn over? as the bible says: screw that!
28987,Homer,you keep thinking that!
28989,Homer,"marge, i won't let that happen. we have to grab this chance for romance now, or we'll never be alone. not 'til lisa's in college and we've lost contact with bart."
28997,Homer,"all i wanted was a second honeymoon, and now the floor is made of lava."
29000,Homer,never!
29003,Homer,"because i was saving that for my birthday. now, c'mon!"
29011,Homer,no one does that to my daughter!
29014,Homer,would i!
29023,Homer,"ugh, too eighties."
29024,Homer,but i've gotta do something! i'll need a disguise.
29034,Homer,comic book guy! don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime!
29037,Homer,this is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!
29039,Homer,"no trap can hold homer simpson! but i'm not homer simpson. i'm the pie man. homer simpson away! i mean, the pie man!"
29070,Homer,i can't do this in front of lisa. why does she have to believe in things?
29077,Homer,homer drunk... but how? hmmm...
29090,Homer,i'm so lame!
29091,Homer,"well, that stinks. but i still get to kiss you, right?"
29094,Homer,there goes a good friend.
29099,Homer,we had just finished our first smooch. and i felt a feeling i'd never felt before:
29101,Homer,"hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?"
29104,Homer,i just blew my first chance at true love.
29106,Homer,"earth to special girl? you forgive me, right?"
29110,Homer,what about now?
29114,Homer,"ooh, a letter from my old pen pal. someday i'll write you back, osama. ah, here's what i'm lookin' for."
29118,Homer,here you go.
29120,Homer,doctor! perform a diagnosis!
29132,Homer,even my best friends have left me! i'm all alone!
29134,Homer,"no, no, no, let her finish."
29139,Homer,what'd you say?
29141,Homer,do you get time off for snitching on your cellmates?
29143,Homer,"yeah, yeah. next commercial."
29154,Homer,"great, dive in."
29155,Homer,i'm not made of money! we'll swim to oakland.
29158,Homer,"no, marge, there's one group that's always welcome in america: immigrants without i.d."
29159,Homer,"well, kids, this is the first chapter of our brand new lives... in america."
29167,Homer,now to do something i've never done before -- help out an old man.
29169,Homer,"bart, you're grounded for a year."
29172,Homer,"i'm always happy to help you, sweetie."
29181,Homer,that was totally worth it.
29185,Homer,okay.
29191,Homer,"marge, i'm pullin' an all-nighter for my little girl. put on a pot of coffee, drink it and start makin' burgers."
29194,Homer,you're the only one who won't shut up about it.
29195,Homer,trying to get a frisbee off the roof.
29203,Homer,woo hoo!
29207,Homer,"oh, i'm so scared. ned flanders is pointing a gun at me. you couldn't even shoot me by accident, even if i whacked the barrel like this."
29211,Homer,it sure is taking me a long time to reach this button.
29213,Homer,"hmmm, i wonder if i could blow up heaven?"
29221,Homer,captain!
29224,Homer,"help me, science!"
29231,Homer,"i'm saying goodbye to everything i ever loved. ooh, a marshmallow!"
29243,Homer,uh-oh.
29266,Homer,"marge, i don't want to freak you out, but i think i love you."
29275,Homer,"twinkle the kidd, i love you!"
29280,Homer,"maybe i was a little hard on him. oh, well. bart, i know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. but what's going on up here?"
29283,Homer,do you know what a boob is?
29285,Homer,exactly. and we're poor because we have kids. and the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is...
29287,Homer,"and marge, you'll always be the best chef in our house."
29291,Homer,"you wanna know a little trick? to downsize my derrière, i just tie a sweater around it."
29295,Homer,"nice try, loser. i bet you made up a fake test."
29296,Homer,all right.
29297,Homer,"ah-ha! here's a mistake. it says the capital of kentucky is frankfort. dream on, pal."
29311,Homer,woo hoo! free cheese!
29314,Homer,woo hoo! i don't know the difference!
29317,Homer,"one of you ate tin cans, one of you ate health food. how you solved crimes i'll never know."
29324,Homer,more!
29326,Homer,i'm here! i'm here! quit buggin' me!
29327,Homer,it's a conversation starter!
29328,Homer,i swallowed a chicken bone.
29333,Homer,"marge, listen to me. chloe may have a flashy job, but you're the backbone of this family. you're like the electrical tape that holds the two halves of my car together."
29336,Homer,"oh. well then, carry on."
29339,Homer,"why you little... need a reason for strangling, do ya... i'll fix your wagon!"
29340,Homer,and i'm growing ashamed of my penis.
29347,Homer,whew!
29351,Homer,"bart's shirt is a classic, marge. just like ""keep on truckin'"". as if i would ever want to stop truckin'."
29355,Homer,look at all that cash.
29358,Homer,twenty-nine ninety-nine.
29365,Homer,i broke some bathroom fixtures.
29369,Homer,"lisa, basic cable said i should nurture you."
29376,Homer,"sweetie, that's orphan talk."
29382,Homer,all i need is some plutonium and i know just the place to get it.
29385,Homer,i juiced it up a little.
29388,Homer,"what's the matter, boy?"
29394,Homer,"the resulting blast would destroy the entire tri-city area, including that guy who sells those blu-blocker sunglasses people sometimes wear."
29404,Homer,"lighten up, marge. this is my chance to relax with people from work i never get to see. like this guy."
29406,Homer,"nice tux, moe."
29407,Homer,"hey, it's a guy in a goofy burns head!"
29417,Homer,phobos? that's a good job for me.
29418,Homer,i declare that you have the most beautiful brown eyes.
29420,Homer,"the border, eh? then i'd better sand off my fingerprints."
29423,Homer,drugs! various drugs! be sure to read instructions! uh-oh! where'd i put the instructions?
29425,Homer,"wow, this is just like hawaii, but you don't get beaten up if you leave the hotel. what gives?"
29447,Homer,"great news, honey! burns made me a freelance consultant!"
29453,Homer,i win...
29457,Homer,"moe's, a tribute. ""m"" is for moe, the owner of moe's. ""o"" is for the ""o"" in the middle of moe's. ""e"" is for acceptance. the feeling i always got here at moe's. oh moe, don't let 'em close you down!"
29465,Homer,"look, look. i can see you're upset. if you need me, i'll be at moe's."
29469,Homer,"boy, i can't wait to get my lips around an ice cold..."
29473,Homer,"whew, that's a relief!"
29478,Homer,"oh marge, don't you love it when our hands meet in the popcorn tub?"
29485,Homer,you're absolutely right! stop this ride!
29486,Homer,"marge, my darling! thank god you're home! i've been dying to hear your feelings!"
29490,Homer,he's only your emotional uncle! i'm your real uncle!
29496,Homer,toilet hole.
29503,Homer,"listen, i gotta tell ya, i chew in my sleep."
29504,Homer,think of me babe whenever / some sweet talking guy in a thong / hands you a bong / don't take...
29511,Homer,"dammit! i never win anything! ooh, here's something i'm good at."
29513,Homer,"i'm number one! i beat my son! victory is mine, so kiss my behind!"
29516,Homer,i'm happy!
29518,Homer,the internet wasn't created for mockery. it was supposed to help researchers at different universities share data sets. it was!
29521,Homer,you wanna do my dance after you score?
29526,Homer,"ooh, i forgot crotch grabbing. that'll be the sun."
29535,Homer,"first, i want you to hurl a ball at the nearest authority figure."
29536,Homer,nicely done.
29541,Homer,"wow. at last, my pathetic little life has a meaning. you suckers, i would have done it for free!"
29542,Homer,"dammit! well, i'll still do it. you suckers, i would have paid you."
29551,Homer,have you tried checking the oil filter?
29552,Homer,"sure, i'd be happy to tell you my problem. i've got a venue the whole world will be watching, and nothing to fill it with."
29561,Homer,"welcome to the ""homer simpson showboating academy."""
29564,Homer,go seminoles! cover-the-point-spread! cover-the-point-spread!
29572,Homer,"fine, go nuts."
29574,Homer,"son, your mother makes a very loud point..."
29575,Homer,"boy, let me explain the situation in terms you'll understand."
29577,Homer,"baby boy, baby boy, ba-ba-ba-baby boy"
29578,Homer,bart's gone! i checked everywhere!
29587,Homer,oh son!... taking your tombstone back to the store will be the happiest thing i've ever done.
29589,Homer,"hollywood producers have paid me a fortune, which i've already lost, for the rights to bart's story. so i have to destroy anything that proves that story's not true."
29595,Homer,the lie is love.
29598,Homer,"coolee, coolee cool! c'mon, fool! be coolee, coolee cool!"
29613,Homer,opposite? yuck!!
29617,Homer,wait a minute! are you two brother and sister?
29619,Homer,"oh kent, not anything. it has to exist. or does it?"
29621,Homer,which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages. which will put more green in the blue. the blue being my pants.
29624,Homer,"yeah, big surprise. hey marge, here's another bomb: i like beer."
29628,Homer,"son, that's the stupidest idea i ever heard. and i know exactly who would pay top dollar for it."
29634,Homer,"oh lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as i consecrate another gay union that angers you so."
29638,Homer,next!
29652,Homer,"this twenty-foot pole will make bart's restraining order oh-so-easy to enforce. and i used my sprawl*mart employee discount to buy this fancy pole cover. it'll keep your pole looking great, poke after poke after poke!"
29654,Homer,"yeah, he's all ""cowabunga, dude!"" what's that mean? nothing, i bet."
29668,Homer,"mmm, hot dog."
29669,Homer,i just don't understand what the problem is.
29673,Homer,i know. that was for the other patients.
29678,Homer,"and how 'bout me getting off work by saying i'm teaching math skills to inner city youths. yes, there are many kinds of heroes."
29680,Homer,i'll give you one.
29691,Homer,wha?
29696,Homer,i'm a chinese acrobat!
29705,Homer,"it wasn't easy, marge -- i've missed you so much."
29706,Homer,is there any other kind?
29713,Homer,"i was this woman's husband for a few days, in name only, and beer will soon obliterate that memory. but i don't think this baby could find any greater love on your planet or ours."
29716,Homer,something's wrong with bart. he's acting weird.
29730,Homer,yes i am.
29731,Homer,sssh! i want her to think i'm cool!
29732,Homer,"if i sign it, it still counts!"
29733,Homer,my hemophilia!
29735,Homer,huh?
29737,Homer,okay. i'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense!
29740,Homer,"i'm sorry, moe. marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!"
29746,Homer,"well, i invented a popsicle made of mountain dew."
29753,Homer,i'll let you punch me!
29757,Homer,"hmmm. a place to dock, eh? i got room -- i have a back yard that makes my front yard look like an idiot."
29764,Homer,that's no marriage bed -- it's a loveless slab of bossiness!
29782,Homer,"wow, marge -- once again, your mom-ly wisdom averted disaster."
29786,Homer,"look, we'll compromise. we'll go see a play...that lisa doesn't want to see."
29787,Homer,hoot! hoot! hoot! hoot! hoot!
29788,Homer,"hey cat, get your own pants!"
29789,Homer,kids! why's the cat so fat?
29798,Homer,"really? you mean eat cheese, gnaw through electrical cords, things like that?"
29806,Homer,"who? oh, that ""my mother."" tell him thanks."
29810,Homer,what are you dopes lookin' at? you've never seen bling-bling before?
29811,Homer,how come nobody told me before?
29824,Homer,...sleeping sweetly...
29825,Homer,i won't tell if you don't tell.
29827,Homer,how do you know the title of my prophetic vision?
29828,Homer,what'd i miss? what'd i miss?
29831,Homer,"stupid wildlife, serves 'em right."
29838,Homer,"c'mon, boy, we're hitting the town. after decompressing, of course."
29841,Homer,"you wish, loser!"
29847,Homer,"hey, man, she's not my lady anymore. we split up, it's all cool, i... i'll kill you!"
29853,Homer,"the water flows down here, through the straightaway, a couple of wicked s-turns..."
29856,Homer,it's raining outside.
29858,Homer,stupid homer-hating family. at least there's one place i'm always welcome.
29861,Homer,so why didn't you invite me?
29865,Homer,"well, i can see i'm not wanted here."
29868,Homer,"finally, a bar for men who like to drink and look at sexy women."
29869,Homer,i'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear.
29871,Homer,the sun.
29889,Homer,"sorry about that, pal."
29899,Homer,"oh sorry, son. i wanted you to bring me the stack of tiles from the top shelf. hey, ray's here!"
29902,Homer,i don't have to -- ray's gonna be here any minute.
29907,Homer,now. now. nnnow.
29909,Homer,ray wouldn't fit in my head -- he's a human man.
29912,Homer,ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
29917,Homer,"flanders, you saw ray on the roof with me!"
29921,Homer,"well, that's a world of difference. light me up, doc!"
29922,Homer,"aw, what did he die of?"
29930,Homer,fascinating!
29931,Homer,"oh kids, i heart you, too!"
29936,Homer,wait a minute. i went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding. somebody owes me big!
29946,Homer,on what channel?
29947,Homer,what day?
29950,Homer,at what time?
29953,Homer,so if i turn my radio on at nine o'clock...
29954,Homer,"so it's mondays at nine, on nbc."
29955,Homer,cbs.
29959,Homer,marge-bot! i'm ready for some lovin'!
29966,Homer,"milkshake festival. look, you can see the booths from your window."
29971,Homer,"that freeloading fatso! marge, could you cut back on your makeup budget?"
29973,Homer,"even better, i'll ask him for my job back."
29974,Homer,youth? i hate them. secondly...
29982,Homer,"marge, i know this is ill-gotten, but can we use it to..."
29983,Homer,time to take out the euro-trash.
30012,Homer,"i wrote it about shelbyville, then changed the names."
30014,Homer,"honey, our time together is precious to me. i didn't want to say anything, but i don't think i'm gonna be around much longer."
30024,Homer,"hey, gimme a break. living through lisa is the healthiest thing that ever happened to me."
30039,Homer,don't stop till it's as natural as breathing.
30054,Homer,"oh, i love you, dumpster-bons."
30058,Homer,left below?! where have i heard that before?
30063,Homer,"okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship."
30065,Homer,blood is raining from the sky!
30068,Homer,i'll take everything you've got!
30069,Homer,"no, thank you."
30071,Homer,this whole deal is scientifically proven. the book of revelation has four hundred and four verses... add the number of people at the last supper...
30073,Homer,"he writes ""3150518"" on the board."
30083,Homer,well... i guess this thing does look pretty silly. let's all take off our sandwich boards and watch tv.
30084,Homer,"when the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here."
30088,Homer,"but sweetheart, i have something they didn't have -- a good feeling about this."
30089,Homer,"c'mon, lisa. no one in this family is being left below."
30096,Homer,please don't go! please? please? i command you!
30103,Homer,"...ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen?! twelve apostles... but jesus was at the last supper too! this changes everything."
30104,Homer,"multiply by seven... don't forget to carry the six, six, six..."
30105,Homer,"wake up! the rapture is coming in half an hour! there's no time to waste! marge, grill a chicken! no, make sandwiches! and some kettle chips would be nice! original, not barbecue!"
30106,Homer,forget school! we have to get to the mesa!
30108,Homer,stupid family... won't even come to my rapture... i went to lisa's school play -- which had serious pacing problems.
30112,Homer,and there's the earth. so beautiful with your many rings.
30115,Homer,hm...
30121,Homer,"lord, you got a first-class destination resort here. really top notch. but i can't enjoy myself knowing my family is suffering."
30123,Homer,"buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy."
30124,Homer,"screw you, dino! you squandered your gift!"
30132,Homer,it was all just a dream.
30140,Homer,how about this guy?
30144,Homer,you wear a bathing suit in the bathtub?
30149,Homer,i'm stuck. why did i eat that apple segment?
30150,Homer,"what are you kids laughing at? and if you say jimmy fallon, i'll know you're lying."
30151,Homer,scantily-clad co-eds?
30152,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to have a libido!
30161,Homer,well that's obvious. he doesn't even know.
30163,Homer,"okay. flanders, you see..."
30168,Homer,oh yeah.
30193,Homer,"flanders. okay, that's it. really irritating!"
30204,Homer,bart! what the hell are you saying?
30212,Homer,bingo!
30217,Homer,"okay, let's make some magic here. i wiped a booger on your shirt, i made a dog and a cat kiss, i swiped a bolted-down tv from a holiday inn..."
30223,Homer,"marge, no one is saying twelve. nine, ten, tops. see..."
30224,Homer,"marge, relax. i've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion."
30225,Homer,"wow! up here, that feels good!"
30229,Homer,"marge, you bring bart home now! once you go vatican, you can't go back again."
30235,Homer,"the broncos won?! why didn't i bet on them, like professor pigskin told me to?"
30238,Homer,"i've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row, and every time, the ""pick of the week"" has been right on the money."
30245,Homer,but the pig!
30249,Homer,"thanks, moe!"
30256,Homer,"um... you're in the wrong house, lady."
30260,Homer,when will you be back?
30261,Homer,who's gonna watch the kids?
30263,Homer,"honey, come back! you didn't say bye to the kids!"
30265,Homer,"kids, i'm sure your mother will be back soon."
30266,Homer,"look, we've been down this road before. i do something stupid, your mom leaves, we eat waffles."
30277,Homer,"oh, marge. what a pleasant surprise."
30280,Homer,hello? marge? where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?
30281,Homer,"hello, marge?"
30290,Homer,don't laugh! they're doing the best they can.
30291,Homer,"oh, just great. things couldn't be better."
30293,Homer,"it wasn't all bad. as part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned."
30296,Homer,marge?
30297,Homer,these are for you.
30299,Homer,"i love you, marge."
30302,Homer,you're needed at home!
30313,Homer,catch me if you can!
30318,Homer,woo hoo!
30320,Homer,yes... but i've got a friend who owes me a solid.
30321,Homer,"flanders, i can't listen to your crap before my coffee."
30326,Homer,two four six eight! i hate stamps! they aren't great!
30336,Homer,"lisa, when you've sustained as many blows to the head as i have, consistency is something, something that, something i love you, bart."
30341,Homer,that's bull man.
30352,Homer,you know that racecar bed i made him?
30369,Homer,"aw, poor maggie."
30370,Homer,"i know, and you did, and you're great."
30372,Homer,you're better than that.
30373,Homer,can't even go in my own kitchen... bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.
30378,Homer,and would they pay handsomely for the privilege?
30380,Homer,"now featuring the pox box! pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. like any disease box, results may vary. pox box!"
30381,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... maggie!"
30382,Homer,"now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome mr. krusty the clown!"
30383,Homer,"goodbye, thanks for coming. if my party made you sick, tell your friends!"
30386,Homer,"marge, what's happening to me?"
30392,Homer,"right... right... right... right... okay... right. i love you, bye!"
30394,Homer,"ooh! ""truck drivers needed in iraq."""
30404,Homer,i'm still not hearing no.
30414,Homer,"bart! we're all disappointed there's no potato salad! but for god's sake, don't jump!"
30418,Homer,make it two kajillion.
30424,Homer,why you metal...!
30427,Homer,"nice and hot-o, mr. robot-o!"
30429,Homer,replace is such an ugly word. we upgraded.
30431,Homer,"lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. in the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the american dream."
30433,Homer,"the sad part is, there were times when i actually had feelings for you. i almost felt i was your father."
30439,Homer,this stinks! i've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that's not equipped for an adult diet.
30453,Homer,ooh! ooh! i wanna ride the bumper cars!
30469,Homer,"wha? hey, you..."
30473,Homer,"gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. maybe she doesn't care anymore!"
30474,Homer,okay.
30481,Homer,"sorry, moe. the place for my arm is around my wife."
30485,Homer,i was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. now let's go to bed.
30489,Homer,"joy to the world, a father's born / let me receive great gifts!"
30493,Homer,what a great father's day!
30501,Homer,it's not my fault! lousy magnet.
30505,Homer,i mean i will win you back.
30510,Homer,"oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. it's a little harder to shut up."
30517,Homer,"what's that, honey? i can't hear you very well!"
30520,Homer,the first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt.
30541,Homer,and i'll find out what a mayor does!
30552,Homer,it's the smell of impending victory.
30555,Homer,but aren't you gonna have fun finding out?
30557,Homer,"that's an excellent question, kent. first of all..."
30558,Homer,what the? it must have shrunk when my wife washed it!
30561,Homer,"please, stop throwing fruit!"
30566,Homer,"hey! nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy! whoops, wrong one."
30567,Homer,"i'll take that... too slow, drooly joe... peek-a-boo! i steal from you!"
30577,Homer,i wish. i made these at work.
30581,Homer,why does every woman i try to talk to run into cans?
30585,Homer,"marge... in a gang? what're you gonna do, shoot me with a frosting gun? seriously, i would love that."
30588,Homer,"now, let's see what marge is up to. ""recipes,"" ""dress patterns,"" ""toaster undercoating agreement""... ""heist plans""!"
30590,Homer,i gotta stop marge from doing something reckless and irresponsible.
30594,Homer,and tell me i'm not fat.
30597,Homer,"bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp..."
30610,Homer,"now we have to drive it straight to rome, where it'll be shipped to mr. burns in springfield."
30617,Homer,let me check the navigation system...
30625,Homer,americano? what the hell could that mean? why can't you people learn to speak my language? i learned to eat your food!
30626,Homer,i honor you and your country.
30631,Homer,"yeah, i never went to college."
30634,Homer,i thought i was doing donald trump.
30637,Homer,sideshow bob!
30643,Homer,everyone remember where we parked.
30651,Homer,maybe he's cheating on us with the episcopalians.
30658,Homer,and did you know that little baby jesus grew up to be... jesus?
30660,Homer,my god... it's over... we're free!
30661,Homer,i said we're free!
30665,Homer,"oh my god, i forgot to get marge a present!"
30678,Homer,"uh yes, i'm a reporter with the local paper. i'm doing a story on people who... wear sweaters. do you mind if i ask you some questions?"
30682,Homer,"so, you don't have any shrunken heads?"
30694,Homer,"listen, old-timer, i'd like you to meet mason fairbanks."
30713,Homer,send up two hams!
30717,Homer,but i'm not tired!
30720,Homer,"hey guys, i have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then i'll be back to go to vegas!"
30724,Homer,"why, there must be some mistake."
30727,Homer,you mean fun homer? i'm afraid serious homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.
30729,Homer,eh.
30731,Homer,"at least you have something you're good at. i'm thirty-eight years old, drivin' a crappy car, with a son who doesn't respect me, and i'm one snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes. mmm, snickers pie."
30733,Homer,"see bart, i told you things could be worse."
30742,Homer,"bart, where are you?!"
30745,Homer,ow! someone's hitting my butt with something!
30756,Homer,"i don't enjoy it. being a father is just a job. long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling ""you screwed me up""!"
30763,Homer,i bet this looks cool from overhead though.
30767,Homer,"son, i'm doing something i should have done a long time ago... taking you to vegas!"
30769,Homer,"uh, normal wear and tear."
30771,Homer,"uh, marge. me and bart got in a fight with this really un-cool pit boss, and now we're in nevada state prison. also, i don't know where bart is. if you see him, say ""hey."""
30776,Homer,"oh, wouldn't it be adequate?"
30785,Homer,i'm getting blue pants in the morning / ding dong the zipper's gonna shine...
30790,Homer,"save me, tsisnajini!"
30791,Homer,i'm stuck! and i have to pee. now i'm just stuck.
30792,Homer,why you little...!
30793,Homer,"don't leave me! i hate to be alone! except when i'm watching tv, then leave me alone. but right now, don't leave!"
30796,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait..."
30797,Homer,now you're telling me burns's story?
30798,Homer,huh?
30799,Homer,gotcha.
30801,Homer,"hey bar-boy, dance around like an idiot. like this!"
30805,Homer,"boy, come here and listen to lisa's story. it's about moe's treasure!"
30806,Homer,"hey moe! thanks to you, i've been sober a week!"
30810,Homer,"well, i guess i should explain. not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so i was out in the forest, hiding."
30831,Homer,don't pressure me. i get enough of that from my dad.
30842,Homer,"oh, you haven't seen bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume i let something terrible happen."
30854,Homer,i am so stoked about lenny's party. he said he's gonna make a surprise announcement!
30856,Homer,i mean the one at the house.
30859,Homer,what?! next you'll be telling me he didn't meet woody woodpecker!
30860,Homer,"lenny, this tv is amazing. if you're not careful, i might just spend the rest of my life on your couch."
30862,Homer,lenny! bring me a beer and your deepest chamber pot! chop-chop!
30865,Homer,"later, if i have enough energy, we can walk up to the tv and i'll show you how thin it is."
30873,Homer,my collection is complete. forty years of the family circus.
30874,Homer,y'ello.
30875,Homer,the big screen tv?
30876,Homer,all expenses paid?
30878,Homer,don't lean out of the tra--
30889,Homer,"yes, tv-sa?"
30892,Homer,"ya know, you don't seem like the money-hungry semi-stripper who's usually on fox. why'd you do it?"
30897,Homer,"uh, okay."
30902,Homer,maggie? she's in her crib.
30904,Homer,"yeah, well, i'm gonna vote ""no"" on thirty-eight so you can't adopt."
30907,Homer,"and marge, you're pretty great too."
30910,Homer,"i've had enough of your stinkin' thinkin'. i, homer simpson, will personally bring the new pro football franchise to springfield."
30915,Homer,so... homer do good?
30922,Homer,"ooh, a penny. this is my lucky day."
30930,Homer,"send someone right over! ooh, here he is."
30931,Homer,"yeah, well while i'm gone, you'll do what he says."
30937,Homer,"oh, the cereal's just a metaphor."
30947,Homer,"let's see... apu's cousin is medium height, dark complexion, brown eyes, black hair..."
30948,Homer,are you kavi?
30954,Homer,"okay book, i didn't read you, and you didn't read me, but we're both in this together, so say something smart or get ready to run like hell. um... ""in business as in breakfast, fried eggs have fragile yolks... huh, huh?"
30957,Homer,"well, a little book once told me..."
30963,Homer,i am a god! i know all!
30965,Homer,marge?
30967,Homer,may firrr... seconnn... thirrr...
30973,Homer,"outta my way, you god-fearing buckleheads!"
30974,Homer,hide me!
30985,Homer,what-ever.
30990,Homer,"man, that bird did it all. good guy."
30991,Homer,land ho!
30993,Homer,"well, i guess we have time for my tale of moist adventure. it takes place in a dark time for mankind when madness and ignorance ruled: ""the nineteen seventies."""
31001,Homer,what? i have great ass suction. now how 'bout a little privacy?
31004,Homer,"swim, fatty, swim!"
31006,Homer,"oh my god, our boat is upside down!"
31009,Homer,"hey, check it out, i'm scratcher or something."
31010,Homer,they're gonna divide the school in two?
31011,Homer,"well, you know what a man invented? actual paper."
31015,Homer,"oh, why did women invent sleeping on the couch?"
31026,Homer,"but sweetie, i just wanted to tell the '74 oakland a's how i felt about them."
31030,Homer,"on second thought, i am brenda wine cooler."
31044,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna take care of you until your amnesia goes scram-nesia. i got you flowers a fluffy pillow...and a nice, relaxing private room."
31049,Homer,why you little...
31050,Homer,"yeah, but he's cool with it. right?"
31052,Homer,now the doctor said a tour of the town could help bring back your memory.
31066,Homer,"marge, if i can't make you remember me, then i'll make you fall for me all over again."
31073,Homer,"i know. wait, i thought of another way: i stay!"
31075,Homer,i know. i just thought maybe... boo!
31078,Homer,that might be marge!
31080,Homer,"i sure have, pardner."
31086,Homer,"you just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. in ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. and there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. and you blew her off."
31135,Homer,buck mitchell!
31137,Homer,season tickets?! i could entertain business clients. i might even land the henderson account!
31138,Homer,sure. that means she wants to talk in private. it's probably about you.
31140,Homer,that's just how i feel.
31158,Homer,don't tell the hamburger in my car.
31160,Homer,"so, why didn't you marry one of your crummy backup dancers?"
31162,Homer,thank god i brought protection.
31170,Homer,i'm going back to the stadium to bring those two kids back together. and i'll do it with or without you!
31174,Homer,great. but enough of the baseball analogies. they sicken me.
31181,Homer,"dirt nap, eh? hm..."
31200,Homer,"marge, could you let it go? you won. she's dead!"
31204,Homer,i've never seen him happier.
31206,Homer,"transport yourself to the shores of nova scotia, where cod and halibut frolic in--"
31208,Homer,and a circus fire!
31219,Homer,beware of el taco belly!
31220,Homer,no mas! no mas!
31221,Homer,"not if i can help it, lisa!"
31229,Homer,we already own a book!
31232,Homer,"oh yeah? blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah..."
31235,Homer,i did! i made a foot rest.
31238,Homer,"yep, it'll do that."
31242,Homer,"oh, uh, that was me. you know that old saying: ""measure like a girl, hammer like a guy."""
31244,Homer,it's allll good.
31255,Homer,"who'd you think would help me, my wife? heh."
31259,Homer,"by the way, nice job installing this wall-chart bracket. if the kids ask, i did it."
31260,Homer,"now as i see it, the problem with this roller coaster is there are too many boring ""going-up"" parts."
31267,Homer,"sweetie, you don't understand. if i can do this myself, then all those lies i told will be true. don't you want daddy's lies to be true?"
31270,Homer,and now i give you... the zoominator!
31273,Homer,the truth is that i'm perfect and everything i touch is perfect!
31274,Homer,i've never felt saferrrr!
31275,Homer,uh-oh. oh. why must we preserve america's historic roller coasters?
31286,Homer,oh no you don't!
31287,Homer,if i can keep down arby's i can keep down you!
31295,Homer,no.
31300,Homer,"you're right. starting tomorrow, no bread before dinner."
31305,Homer,it's amazing. he tastes just like jeffrey tambor.
31306,Homer,"marge, to keep you in my life, i'd do anything. there must be some way to turn my problem into a positive for the community."
31316,Homer,"so, it's a war of the worlds. good thing we've got the sun on our side."
31317,Homer,"go ahead and hide, you coward!"
31323,Homer,"eh, big deal -- by the time bart's eighteen, we're gonna control the world! we're china, right?"
31328,Homer,now where's my parade? where's my parade?
31340,Homer,everyone got an assignment but us.
31349,Homer,gung hay fat choi! gung hay fat choi!
31356,Homer,"well, what have we got?"
31358,Homer,i'm not gonna surrender. you've seen what the u.s. army does to prisoners. how would you like to be stacked naked in a pile with a hillbilly girl pointing at you and laughing?
31363,Homer,hmm... let's see what your hangover has to say!
31384,Homer,do not mention that publication in this house! they never published my poem!
31387,Homer,lousy. i gotta go to vermont for some stupid poetry thing.
31390,Homer,wow. troopers from every state in new england.
31392,Homer,"man, couples in this state sure like to clink glasses."
31415,Homer,this is the most fun i've ever had giving you wood.
31429,Homer,"whoa marge, for the first time in my life, i'm excited about going to work!"
31438,Homer,"marge, everything looks wonderful!"
31439,Homer,"well, i'm off to pedal my frosty wares!"
31441,Homer,"i would never let you down. our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. and trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. in cone-clusion, here's the scoop: i love you."
31443,Homer,oh my god! it's the opportunity of a lifetime!
31450,Homer,woo hoo! i'm gonna be on time!
31456,Homer,"marge, i wrote you a check for three hundred dollars to pay for all the sculptures i broke. okay?"
31459,Homer,"marge? i have an apology that i hope is better than all the other ones. so please listen carefully. the thing i liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love i received from obese children. it was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art."
31462,Homer,"i'm laughing in the last one, but it's only 'cause the cat fell down the stairs."
31465,Homer,"marge, where are you? did you change your name? is it kelly? kelly!!!"
31474,Homer,goooo... lovemaking!
31492,Homer,ow! i can't read ahead -- i promised lisa i wouldn't!
31494,Homer,angelica was trapped in the suffoclock of sandy doom...
31498,Homer,uh... how would you feel if something bad happened to greystash?
31502,Homer,"uh, they went to star wars land and fought star wars."
31506,Homer,no man should outlive his fictional wizard! no man!
31507,Homer,"just think, lisa, if i had paid for those skating lessons, that could've been you!"
31511,Homer,your present is leaving.
31514,Homer,why did you let that loser into our home?
31516,Homer,really? who's gonna make him?
31517,Homer,he sure has a lot of markers that don't work.
31519,Homer,lower the boom!
31523,Homer,"marge, admit it -- you just can't say ""no"" to anyone. that's why you have three kids."
31529,Homer,"those legs go on forever. oh wait, they stop right there."
31539,Homer,"now remember, marge, we're not buying anything for more than one-point-two. but if i scratch my nose, that means we can go to one-point-five."
31542,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry i couldn't figure out how to get that movie onto your ipod... so i'm taking the family on a surprise vacation to barnacle bay!"
31543,Homer,we left plenty of food so you won't starve.
31548,Homer,"it's not sugar, it's caramel!"
31551,Homer,"oh, i can't stand to see your mother unhappy. but this town could be great for your mother again. and i know three people who can make it happen."
31555,Homer,"all night long, baby."
31557,Homer,"a green spinner to build suspense... and then the big finale, the:"
31558,Homer,"oh, so, forming an angry mob, eh? who we goin' after?"
31559,Homer,i think the hook is touching my brain. .
31562,Homer,how many yum-yum fish did we get?
31568,Homer,so that means... it is opposite day.
31582,Homer,why you little...
31591,Homer,ah! nothin' beats taking a family drive with our new satellite radio.
31594,Homer,hey! nobody cuts me off!
31596,Homer,then what's america doing in iraq?
31604,Homer,nine a.m.?!
31615,Homer,...iiiiiis!
31618,Homer,"ooh, a penny!"
31622,Homer,here it is: the harmless chair of relaxation!
31623,Homer,little do you know that the count of monte cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours.
31626,Homer,oui oui! and i have spent the last five years plotting the most exquisite revenge!
31628,Homer,you guys liked him?
31633,Homer,"is it ""the count of monte cristo?"" 'cause i love that story."
31637,Homer,"this is it. it's taken all day, we've missed our flight to hawaii, but finally, i'll get my revenge."
31640,Homer,"parents who are still alive, i might add."
31641,Homer,you don't frighten me!
31645,Homer,"that's okay, boy. the two of us got to talking."
31651,Homer,"hey, that jerk cut us off! pull alongside!"
31658,Homer,this cell phone is so i can call you whenever i need your driving services. i've put in my own ring tone!
31660,Homer,"i need you to go the gas station. tell them you need to inflate your tires, but actually you inflate these volleyballs."
31664,Homer,that was me. some very un-cool people put me in here.
31665,Homer,it's dark in here!
31666,Homer,bart! this is a matter of life and death: what is the difference between ketchup and catsup?
31668,Homer,"you know, my great-great grandmother was an indian. i guess i should've mentioned that before, huh?"
31671,Homer,"i mean in this day and age, when the link between sex and pregnancy has been proven so... conclusively in... scientific american, where..."
31681,Homer,the light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea.
31683,Homer,hm... what's changed for me since the last time i saw you? only... everything!
31686,Homer,"you see declan, i made my millions with a simple invention -- ""the condiment pen""!"
31695,Homer,"it's been another eight years, and what do i have? same job, same house, same dirty joke book..."
31700,Homer,"you there, boy! buy me a christmas goose! the biggest one in the shop!"
31714,Homer,"marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. because i've got a plan..."
31717,Homer,"what the? but i thought bankruptcy was the cool law! the one that says ""dude, don't worry about it. i got this."""
31720,Homer,"give it here, i'll find some fat we can trim. here you go, a giant useless expense for something that no one is interested in."
31725,Homer,"sure, but i think you're exaggerating the problem."
31742,Homer,selma!
31743,Homer,"hola, i am esteban de la sexface. that means stephen of the sexface."
31746,Homer,i guess i always dreamed that my father would grow old alone.
31747,Homer,"a thousand, eh?"
31755,Homer,where is he? i know he's in here.
31756,Homer,"i don't have to make a wish, because i already have this wonderful family. i wish for infinity hamburgers."
31772,Homer,marge! this isn't like you.
31774,Homer,that's quite an offer -- can i discuss it with my wife?
31775,Homer,then i'll do it!
31785,Homer,"oh, uh... she's looking very snappy!"
31789,Homer,okay.
31791,Homer,"boy, i never thought i'd have my own dark room."
31794,Homer,that photo's mine. that photo's mine. that photo's mine.
31796,Homer,did i attach the harness?
31803,Homer,"now maggie, i had to use your car seat to hold the new tv guide...so i'm gonna hang you from the mirror."
31805,Homer,"ten and two, einstein!"
31808,Homer,and then he said he didn't want a twin because they'd just fight.
31809,Homer,you're right -- i'm giving up photography...
31819,Homer,providing you celebrities do something for me.
31822,Homer,what's wrong?
31826,Homer,"not naked, i haven't."
31829,Homer,"wait, that's soccer? i always called it ""human foosball."" would you like me to take you to your game?"
31837,Homer,so... tired.
31847,Homer,she has not! your daughter's a dirty player!
31851,Homer,"when i put on these shorts, i'm not your father anymore. and judging by how tight they are, i'm never gonna be anyone else's either."
31864,Homer,those places are pretty terrible.
31865,Homer,i sure do.
31873,Homer,i guess i could just sit on a bed...
31879,Homer,woo hoo!
31888,Homer,"relax. i'm a licensed mattress professional, if there were such a thing. and i've got the answer to your problems -- the snugulux, by matrimonium!"
31895,Homer,on one condition: you do the shlepping.
31900,Homer,i can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...
31901,Homer,lousy reverend. he's having my sex! while i'm at home with marge not doing anything sexual or erotic.
31903,Homer,sorry.
31906,Homer,or a chicken club... or a reuben... or a monte cristo... or a... pull over behind that billboard!
31907,Homer,"it's like our honeymoon all over again. aw, we even have the same bum looking at us."
31908,Homer,woo hoo!
31912,Homer,"good work, boy. just for that, we're gonna treat your heart murmur, not just ""see how it goes."""
31913,Homer,stupid baby... growing her brain... on my dime!
31918,Homer,"that's ridiculous. if i had set up those dominoes, i'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads."
31923,Homer,john lennon?!
31924,Homer,yoko?
31926,Homer,you're confusing drugs with druuuuugs.
31928,Homer,because i'm filled with stress!
31929,Homer,i have three kids and no money! why can't i have no kids and three money?
31932,Homer,mm-hm.
31937,Homer,i feel kinda responsible. maybe i should volunteer to be a fireman.
31938,Homer,"oh, i can't wait for my first fire. is that one?"
31946,Homer,woo hoo!
31951,Homer,"hey, it's the least they can do after we saved them from being melty-faced weirdoes."
31964,Homer,"we're not thieves, we're scavengers! like the beautiful vulture, or the heroic tapeworm, or america's sweetheart, the maggot."
31970,Homer,we sent it to skid row where it would do the most good.
31975,Homer,sure is a lot of corn in this parking lot.
31977,Homer,"fine, you want out? then go! i can make it on my own! before i met you i had friends and dreams!"
31978,Homer,oh please take me back. the dating scene is a nightmare. i'm begging you!
31979,Homer,"deep down, i... i guess i knew that."
31981,Homer,"hey, this maze is made of corn!"
31982,Homer,i'm so sick of being lost. to hell with maze etiquette! i'm walking straight outta here!
31989,Homer,all right.
31992,Homer,"cheer up, boy. we'll get you their most vicious street cur! he'll bite your ass raw!"
31993,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not made of money!"
31996,Homer,don't... give snake... attention... it's what... he really... wants.
32006,Homer,"ooh, it's that bar i like! wait here in the car."
32007,Homer,"okay, milhouse, what do you want to do?"
32018,Homer,"oh, i'm just glad you taste like hot dogs!"
32022,Homer,almost ready! here we go.
32046,Homer,i'm gonna glue my mouth shut with butterscotch!
32051,Homer,"fine, cone."
32052,Homer,what's this?!
32053,Homer,"america west, please."
32060,Homer,"marge, the couch is lumpy!"
32063,Homer,did you know that every day mexican gays sneak into this country and unplug our brain-dead ladies?
32070,Homer,liberals!
32073,Homer,hoo!
32077,Homer,i'm afraid they might. but i will not be silenced. the truth is...
32082,Homer,"dinner with mr. burns! what a waste of my precious, precious saturday night."
32087,Homer,a p-p-p-p-p-private jet!
32091,Homer,"oh my god... lionel richie?! can you sing ""say you say me,"" but make it about beer?"
32119,Homer,i've really enjoyed paying you to yell at me and say i suck. but it's no use -- i'm a hopeless loser and always will be.
32120,Homer,this i can do!
32121,Homer,behold my two-seventeen average... and weep!
32128,Homer,"i'm gettin' that job. bart, i'll need some clean urine. stat."
32130,Homer,i got the job!
32131,Homer,"i'm gonna get there early, so i can get in good with the lunch truck guy."
32135,Homer,look happy.
32141,Homer,say it!
32144,Homer,"i couldn't bear to tell your mother, so i hang out here all day."
32145,Homer,"brands like ""miser's choice"" and ""day-old delights?"""
32159,Homer,duke? that's good.
32168,Homer,leave her!
32174,Homer,"don't worry, we'll just go home. your mother can cook."
32176,Homer,"lisa's right, son. your mom is way too classy a lady to crash a private--"
32177,Homer,"everyone just act cool. if anyone asks, tell them we're plumbers... and then start plumbing until they go away."
32185,Homer,"my back! it hurts, and not in a good way!"
32186,Homer,stop that! i'm down here!
32194,Homer,knowing how in spring i'm bewitched by you so?
32197,Homer,"oh, oh, i just have one question: what is this movie about?"
32214,Homer,but i need my childhood friends to help me keep it real. would you have me keep it fake?
32221,Homer,what? that's how guys talk.
32227,Homer,"so did you see the show tonight? remember the part where i forgot the words and i just sang ""uh-oh spaghetti-os"". i'm hoping they send me a case."
32236,Homer,d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh / woo woo woo woo woo woo hoo / stu stu stu stu-pid flanders...
32238,Homer,"well that's it, i'm retiring from the opera. it's just too popular."
32242,Homer,throw my hands up and
32249,Homer,spilled milk?!
32251,Homer,"hey apu, what happened to all your milk?"
32252,Homer,does it work?
32257,Homer,at first i thought you were pointing to your crotch.
32260,Homer,okay. let me just grab my registration.
32261,Homer,i can't believe your boss lets you listen to rock music while you work.
32281,Homer,you're hovering over a hydrant!
32282,Homer,"i've got tow dough i'm lookin' to blow, moe!"
32283,Homer,i'm buying a round of the fanciest drink you got.
32285,Homer,"marge, when you're married to a midnight towboy, you might not see him for days on end."
32292,Homer,"if my life as a tow truck driver were a teleplay, this would be the end of act two."
32297,Homer,"ooh, a trap door. what's down there? your meatball collection?"
32303,Homer,"ask no questions. and do not call the police, or i will kill me."
32314,Homer,"oh, wait. that's lisa's nose."
32319,Homer,"you have to think, it's your job!"
32325,Homer,"goodnight, sweetheart."
32329,Homer,gonna make it! gonna make it!
32331,Homer,"hmmm. well, marge, who's the unfit parent now?"
32356,Homer,"seconds, please."
32357,Homer,i'll kill her after dessert!
32358,Homer,you ruined that pie!
32362,Homer,i just get to keep whatever's in the guy's wallet.
32365,Homer,"hey, who wants ice cream in bed?"
32367,Homer,"oh, that was so hot! i love watching you do other guys!"
32368,Homer,that can be arranged.
32372,Homer,"how about a little neck rub, baby?"
32379,Homer,"wow, you guys are good. the alien's right here in the living room."
32385,Homer,"oh, lighten up. it's halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment."
32386,Homer,hold still! i'm trying to eat my way out from the inside!
32390,Homer,beehive!
32397,Homer,uh...
32406,Homer,and we'll move your bedtime to an hour later so you'll have more time to be alone with your thoughts.
32412,Homer,cha-ching!
32418,Homer,"a song? wait, it's coming back to me."
32419,Homer,the girl i love's got beautiful hair / a blue bouffant from here to there
32427,Homer,we're gonna be rich! we can finally start a family!
32431,Homer,i hear that.
32452,Homer,fashions.
32454,Homer,"please, doc. i know i'm not the greatest looking guy in the world, but i took care of my family, and that used to be enough. but not anymore."
32455,Homer,and i know how i can knock myself out. i'll look at your bill.
32456,Homer,"hm. i guess considering all the training you've received, this is quite reasonable. i've never seen anything so reasonable! it's the bargain of a lifetime! and--"
32469,Homer,"no, i want you to give me every other surgery you have so i can look good! and can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it?"
32488,Homer,sold! sucker.
32492,Homer,why is everything hollywood makes so excellent? whyyyy?
32494,Homer,"good luck, with my finicky appetite."
32507,Homer,he cheats at uno!
32509,Homer,i still can't stand him... i still can't stand him... i still can't stand him...
32513,Homer,uh-huh.
32514,Homer,yes.
32518,Homer,i remember.
32520,Homer,are you done? 'cause i've been circling the funeral home for ten minutes.
32521,Homer,"hey, what smells so good?"
32526,Homer,no more drinking.
32530,Homer,or yourselves?
32543,Homer,flanders!
32547,Homer,"dad, i can't remember what i did last night. do you have any idea?"
32548,Homer,your memory bubble and you.
32549,Homer,i'm afraid i did something to make marge and the kids leave me.
32551,Homer,done.
32559,Homer,this bubble allows you to view any past event from your life. it's got that new bubble smell.
32560,Homer,"aw, i landed in a pleasant memory -- look at happy me and playful them."
32564,Homer,"lisa, i'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life. you wanna join me?"
32567,Homer,i'll teach you to beat up yester-me!
32575,Homer,what if you just moved the bottle?
32577,Homer,how can i get my memory to work?
32582,Homer,"goodbye, cruel world."
32586,Homer,a life well-lived. until last night. i guess i'll have to watch that now.
32587,Homer,"hey, what's going on here?!"
32590,Homer,oh my god! it's like christmas in december! let's celebrate now.
32593,Homer,"oh, right."
32599,Homer,"for the love of god, make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce."
32606,Homer,"listen carefully. i have taken your wife hostage. if you don't have a wife, i have kidnapped your brother. nod if you understand."
32608,Homer,good. now stop and dance like a happy prospector.
32610,Homer,happier!
32617,Homer,"marge, that was a joke!"
32620,Homer,"uh-oh, can't let marge see this."
32621,Homer,a drive-up trashcan!
32630,Homer,what? not allowed to get one right?
32631,Homer,die hard two!
32648,Homer,i thought global warming would take care of it. al gore can't do anything right.
32651,Homer,"oh, it was a wonderful time. the iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling matt groening created ""futurama,"" and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a tv show called ""melrose place""..."
32655,Homer,a dream called inoffensive urban light hip-hop smooth grooves.
32659,Homer,i had finally realized every rock star's dream...
32660,Homer,...hating being famous.
32661,Homer,a tale of two young outlaws in love...
32666,Homer,"i mean, unless he had been a little nicer at the beach."
32670,Homer,that was the best christmas ever.
32673,Homer,what if i told you some of the greatest love stories of all time?
32674,Homer,even better -- a tale of ... one moment.
32678,Homer,"happy valentine's day, and shut your gob."
32690,Homer,"aw, don't give up, boy. i believe in you -- and not just because i have to."
32708,Homer,"oh boy, dinner time! the perfect break between work and drunk."
32720,Homer,"i, uh, i have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. conservation of mass -- it's the law."
32735,Homer,"but kids, i want you in bed by three a.m."
32746,Homer,"my hindu friend, this is a chance for your kwik-e-mart to get in on the ground floor of a delicious new taste sensation."
32754,Homer,"yeah, that's it, don't be shy..."
32757,Homer,"that wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal."
32759,Homer,when you cut 'em they multiply -- i can't fight that! now let's take care of those raccoons.
32762,Homer,lisa!
32765,Homer,i can't believe you were smoking. do you know the sturgeon general said you're not supposed to?
32767,Homer,"marge, i'm taking lisa out of that stupid-- what the?"
49165,Lisa,toora loora loora
49170,Lisa,"dad, is this from a meth lab?"
49173,Lisa,here's an imaginary cell phone.
49179,Lisa,"it's me, you idiot."
49183,Lisa,"i think we're following you. what's your species, little guy?"
49185,Lisa,"well, i could tell mom and dad the chip is in the bird and hope they take me to machu picchu another time, or..."
49202,Lisa,i'll take ten bucks no-ow.
49222,Lisa,"""singer of yentl"", thirteen letters... um..."
49230,Lisa,"guess what, mom? i'm a cruciverbalist!"
49238,Lisa,"ooh, thank you!"
49239,Lisa,cruciverbalists from far and wide have gathered here for a no-holds-barred test of skill.
49240,Lisa,"no, none."
49242,Lisa,"dad, i could actually win this thing!"
49246,Lisa,wish me luck.
49249,Lisa,i blew it again.
49257,Lisa,"no, i'm not mad."
49271,Lisa,and master puzzle constructor merl reagle?!
49275,Lisa,and they've already started exploiting the next holiday.
49281,Lisa,"thank you, krusty!"
49284,Lisa,yeah.
49287,Lisa,"or, check out this mytunes-exclusive episode of ""itchy and scratchy."""
49296,Lisa,huh? where are the bees?
49300,Lisa,"but dad, bees pollinate flowers."
49305,Lisa,"it's not for long. but until they find a suitable habitat, this beard is the only hope for these bees."
49306,Lisa,"actually, bees rarely sting when they're in a cluster. they only attack to defend their hive."
49308,Lisa,"dad, don't eat the bees!"
49316,Lisa,"there's only one place in town where the bees can survive. and mr. burns wants to tear it down. please, people. you didn't listen to me about the snail darter, you didn't listen to me about the osprey, and you didn't listen to me about the javelina."
49326,Lisa,they sound awfully mad. are they dangerous?
49332,Lisa,"um, excuse me, but i think her painting is very imaginative."
49337,Lisa,"i need some candy for a first playdate, but i don't want to come on too strong."
49338,Lisa,"well... if i pick plain she'll think i'm cheap, but if i pick peanut, she may have an allergy. you just killed her, bart!"
49341,Lisa,"hi, juliet."
49343,Lisa,does it get you into special exhibits?
49344,Lisa,that's today!
49347,Lisa,"now we need a name for our imaginary kingdom -- i mean, queendom."
49349,Lisa,gosh. this is all happening so fast. i don't know what to say.
49356,Lisa,i love your accent. two-nicorn. you are definitely doing the book on tape.
49357,Lisa,and queens valedictoria and helvetica hid their beloved two-nicorn from the hungry ogre homeroni.
49359,Lisa,juliet? are you okay?
49361,Lisa,"juliet, you're scaring me just a little--"
49367,Lisa,"well, you can't keep juliet and me apart! i'll... i'll disobey!"
49372,Lisa,you know what i think killed this place? no one wanted to drive to the middle of the forest for clams.
49374,Lisa,equalia is not real!
49383,Lisa,"it's a special place, but i need to live in the real world."
49390,Lisa,he's not crying and he's not known for clowning.
49406,Lisa,"i was describing beautiful fish, bart!"
49420,Lisa,this test penalizes guessing.
49423,Lisa,"oh well, maybe it'll be more fun to be a regular, average, stay-at-home..."
49424,Lisa,huh?
49430,Lisa,"okay, everyone squeeze in."
49434,Lisa,"dad, we've been trapped in the house for days. can't we play outside?"
49450,Lisa,"well, more of a curious george."
49451,Lisa,why would mother superior lie to me about not having maggie? what is going on?
49452,Lisa,a jewel! why would nuns want a jewel?
49455,Lisa,oh sure.
49456,Lisa,hm...
49470,Lisa,that's tonight!
49472,Lisa,"oh my god. i know what the biggest ""ring"" in ""springfield"" is. it's been right in front of us the whole time."
49476,Lisa,great...
49479,Lisa,"so, the anagram spells: ""regally, the rock gem is..."""
49490,Lisa,mom! how did you know maggie was here?
49500,Lisa,this broadcast is from 1979.
49502,Lisa,fifty-fifty?
49507,Lisa,"you were born while they were married so legally, no. but in the sense someone calls you one when they're angry, yes."
49509,Lisa,that's the angry one.
49510,Lisa,"i don't understand. dad would never miss an open bar with chicken wings. plus he loves mom, and us, yada, yada, yada."
49517,Lisa,we don't want your cookies.
49527,Lisa,"and in the new nineveh , darkness falls."
49534,Lisa,"bart, in my concurrent adventure, i learned a really important lesson: you can't wallow in despair. face things as they really are."
49539,Lisa,"dad, i've got the perfect thing."
49540,Lisa,it's mac and cheese from the school cafeteria. the blandest food known to man.
49545,Lisa,"baked potato, side salad and a--"
49547,Lisa,"dad, if i join a clique, i'll be the kind of person i hate."
49556,Lisa,not if you use a dimmer switch.
49562,Lisa,field trips to europe!
49564,Lisa,principal skinner?
49566,Lisa,"uh, who's alaska nebraska?"
49570,Lisa,"bart, at this school, i'm not a brain, i'm not popular, i'm not anything!"
49577,Lisa,"l'ecole, c'est moi!"
49579,Lisa,"caitlin, hi! do a reading at your bat mitzvah? a sheynam dank!"
49581,Lisa,"alaska, we've never met, but everyone thinks i'm your best friend."
49583,Lisa,you have a show?
49599,Lisa,...and doc...tor hibbert.
49602,Lisa,"because a woman shouldn't have to depend on a man. snow white was brought back to life, by a lady doctor."
49606,Lisa,"well, i qualified for the national math bee--"
49610,Lisa,i dunno -- chasing ducks? buried alive? he'll be missed. let's move. i've gotta collect pine cones.
49613,Lisa,"mom, i came here to tell you it's not too late to back out."
49618,Lisa,yeah?
49620,Lisa,"congratulations, hubert. or should i congratulate your tutor: amelia, at the homework factory! your victory is tainted! asterisk! asterisk!"
49623,Lisa,i don't want to talk about it.
49624,Lisa,i do.
49628,Lisa,i'm in.
49630,Lisa,and people will remember you were there?
49631,Lisa,crisscross.
49633,Lisa,you killed her?
49648,Lisa,"dad, no! that's the last book in the world!"
49651,Lisa,"apu, how did you survive?"
49655,Lisa,and all we had to do was let bart take a bath in our food.
49663,Lisa,you're gonna be so embarrassed. there are two other people at this party dressed just like you.
49670,Lisa,i have one minute to avoid my first late assignment ever. the pipe cleaner fur is coming off on my hands!
49672,Lisa,spell? those girls couldn't have made her sick... or could they?
49673,Lisa,did you girls make miss hoover sick?
49676,Lisa,i worship nature!
49683,Lisa,with perfect faith and perfect love.
49690,Lisa,"no, thank you. i've been rational but nerdy my whole life. but these past few weeks, you girls made me feel cool. cool! me! lisa simpson!"
49692,Lisa,you just increased the volume!
49699,Lisa,"and now, making his debut on the catwalk... bartholomew!"
49701,Lisa,because you envy us. maggie and i share the deepest bond there is: sisterhood.
49702,Lisa,"we'll be closer than best friends for the rest of our lives. but you'll never know what that's like, because you won't ever have a brother."
49706,Lisa,"you can have mine, but he's kind of an idiot."
49707,Lisa,"two brothers? bart, who is this kid?"
49710,Lisa,you left a trail of lost winter clothes.
49719,Lisa,slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.
49721,Lisa,bart!
49732,Lisa,what do you care? you don't even like him.
49734,Lisa,where'd you get this rope?
49743,Lisa,just give me this!
49752,Lisa,wow! how long has the tv been out?
49755,Lisa,just think what that game could do for grampa and his friends!
49764,Lisa,yeah. or is it just a cover story for a grownup thing we're not allowed to know about?
49766,Lisa,thank you!
49769,Lisa,"one labatty, please."
49777,Lisa,"my pearls? these were a gift from my mom, when i could first read at a twelfth grade level."
41588,Lisa,not every question!
41590,Lisa,"yeah, even though mcdonald's owns yale now, it's still a great school. and i could never afford to go there if i hadn't won the montgomery burns scholarship."
49782,Lisa,"i'm fine! fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine..."
41594,Lisa,uh...
49791,Lisa,"i won't give up. i have to know that somewhere in the muck and the mire and the pittsburgh poisoners, this family had a noble spark. and i will find it, even if i have to go back to adam and eve."
41601,Lisa,really?
41602,Lisa,"um, have you eaten onions lately?"
49793,Lisa,thank you.
49797,Lisa,old ad for buzz cola...
41611,Lisa,quick! quick! everyone into my dream!
49807,Lisa,she wasn't a slave owner! our family was on the underground railroad!
49808,Lisa,"no, the ""underground railroad"" was a bunch of people who helped slaves escape to canada. there were no actual trains, and it wasn't under ground."
41620,Lisa,got any joyce carol oates?
41623,Lisa,"so how do you like being a walrus, dad?"
41624,Lisa,"yeah, bart."
49828,Lisa,"the year was 1860, and the underground railroad was..."
41640,Lisa,"i'm dizzy! i'm nauseous! oh, but i'm popular!"
49833,Lisa,huh?
49835,Lisa,"you were right, dad. i should have quit while i was ahead, instead of learning the horrible truth about our family and virgil."
41647,Lisa,i have a paw!
49840,Lisa,racists?
41650,Lisa,"oh, yuck! that sandwich is full of meat. there's bacon, canadian bacon, mexican bacon..."
49843,Lisa,just close your eyes and think of milhouse.
49845,Lisa,"well, sometimes people who agree on most things have one issue that they disagree strongly about. in politics it's called a ""wedge issue"" -- like illegal immigration or gay marriage."
49851,Lisa,"life stinks, huh?"
49852,Lisa,mom said she was tipped off by a note from me. but you know something? i didn't write this note.
41668,Lisa,"you can do it, lisa. there's nothing in the room but you and the test."
41672,Lisa,here it comes.
49866,Lisa,somebody posted a comment?
41679,Lisa,"mom, chloe just won the peabody award!"
41680,Lisa,"i'll tell you what's wrong: you getting a c on this project and winding up at a third-rate college. lisa, the world needs you to go to wellesley!"
49872,Lisa,the man hates pants.
41684,Lisa,the rice wine has penetrated to the essence of your souls.
49877,Lisa,"ah yes, ""jerusalem syndrome."" the name given to religious delusions or psychoses that occur when people visit jerusalem."
41686,Lisa,"dad, bart's feet are on my half of the shell!"
41687,Lisa,where's mr. bergstrom?
49878,Lisa,"hmm... dad said he was going to ""unite all faiths."" and only one site is sacred to muslims, christians and jews -- the dome of the rock!"
41689,Lisa,mr. bergstrom! mr. bergstrom!
49879,Lisa,krav maga!
49880,Lisa,"no, the ants are the farmers."
49882,Lisa,fine.
41694,Lisa,"hey, lisa, indeed."
41697,Lisa,"oh, please."
41700,Lisa,"thank you, mr. bergstrom."
49894,Lisa,"as in ""little orphan."""
49897,Lisa,"ants have six legs, bart."
41708,Lisa,baboon!
49905,Lisa,"dad, if we're really off the grid, then we won't get power when the air is still."
41714,Lisa,"i'm sorry i called you a baboon, dad."
49908,Lisa,we're gonna go check out the wind damage!
41717,Lisa,mom! you wouldn't dare.
41720,Lisa,half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
41722,Lisa,"grampa, what a question?"
41723,Lisa,sprinkles and syrup.
49918,Lisa,but i don't know how to drive.
49920,Lisa,it's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart.
41730,Lisa,"way to go, grampa."
49922,Lisa,"you know, when i'm sad, i read something beautiful and true: poetry."
49927,Lisa,bye! goodbye!
49928,Lisa,bluella?
41737,Lisa,too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
41738,Lisa,"yeah, mom! guess what? for a dollar a man sold me thirty-five caspers and a dozen lois lanes."
49933,Lisa,no. i'm not gonna be disappointed again.
41745,Lisa,zee-boo. zee-boo.
41746,Lisa,i'm trying to teach maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. i want her to have all the advantages that i didn't have.
41747,Lisa,"it's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. hump and dew-lap. hump and dew-lap."
41752,Lisa,"ooh, look, maggie, what is that? do-dec-ah-edron. dodecahedron."
41755,Lisa,"it's to open the crate, stupid."
49949,Lisa,i didn't know we had a debate team.
49950,Lisa,...and that is why hybrid car buyers should be given rebates paid for by taxes on hamburgers.
49954,Lisa,"first of all, my father no longer has any functioning credit cards. secondly, how dare you refer--"
49955,Lisa,i... i...
41767,Lisa,"happy birthday to me / happy birthday to me / happy birthday, overlooked middle child -- happy birthday to me."
49959,Lisa,i ha--
41771,Lisa,"although i am aware you are looking at me, i would look exactly the same even if you weren't."
41774,Lisa,"bye, bye, leon / bye, roomie / bye, pardner / you're a credit to dementia!"
41776,Lisa,daaad!
49968,Lisa,"oh, i can't go on! this rebuttal is a sham!"
49970,Lisa,"well guess what, i am not a brunette! i'm a blonde!"
41781,Lisa,not very well.
49976,Lisa,grandma?!
41790,Lisa,bart! there's no such thing as first bedsies. you just made that up.
49982,Lisa,i know where bob's taking bart!
41793,Lisa,"no, really, what?"
41797,Lisa,"ah, me too!"
49990,Lisa,"and when you wag your tail, it really lights up a room."
41800,Lisa,only two. i checked.
41804,Lisa,"okay, but you don't know what you're missing."
49997,Lisa,"ew, no thanks."
41810,Lisa,"mr. jefferson, my name is lisa simpson, and i have a problem."
50007,Lisa,do you guys always do that?
41825,Lisa,you change it.
50020,Lisa,i can't go home. something happened this week that completely changed me!
50022,Lisa,"well, the combination of me leaving arts camp and you driving on and off the shoulder has made me a little ill."
41831,Lisa,"hey, stop that."
50023,Lisa,"okay, maybe it won't be that bad."
50025,Lisa,but arts camp encouraged us to spread our wings and fly.
50027,Lisa,it's just... dinner conversation at arts camp was a bit more stimulating. one night we spoke only in lines from famous poems.
41836,Lisa,"no one wants your stupid police badge, bart."
50028,Lisa,emily dickinson.
41841,Lisa,"bart, that's so sweet. may i see the card?"
50035,Lisa,are you saying arts camp was a lie?
50037,Lisa,"it's called ""applause."""
41849,Lisa,"i will, mr. gumbel. but if you'll excuse me, i'm profiling my dad for the school paper. i thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick."
41850,Lisa,"uh, excuse me, i have the chocolate milk."
41852,Lisa,our dad... now he belongs to the ages.
50047,Lisa,"let's see, i could help someone in any impoverished area on earth. bangladesh... bolivia... east springfield?!"
50048,Lisa,nelson?!
41858,Lisa,come on...
50055,Lisa,"no, but there is something i can't hold back any more. i'm your microfinance donor!"
50056,Lisa,"well, i didn't do this for thanks, but if you want to thank me, i can stand here and listen for as long as it takes."
50059,Lisa,"principal skinner, i need to convince nelson to come back to school."
50062,Lisa,"oh, i don't know. i thought one of these super-successful people might tell you how important it is to stay in school. why look, it's mark zuckerberg, the founder of facebook!"
41877,Lisa,i didn't select this costume for mobility. i wore it to salute the noble native american of the pacific northwests...
41878,Lisa,yahhh!
50070,Lisa,"nelson, i just wanted to say that i realize now you can't be anyone else other than who you are, and..."
41881,Lisa,"no, bart. peace on earth."
50076,Lisa,sorry!
41886,Lisa,"oh, no! maggie made a wish!"
50078,Lisa,i plan to attend an ivy league school myself. i do have a 4.0 gpa.
41888,Lisa,i wish for world peace.
50081,Lisa,"uh, that's it."
41890,Lisa,bart... bart...
50083,Lisa,thrust! parry! dodge! poke!
41892,Lisa,"thanks, bart."
50091,Lisa,"look, if you want to play liability-insured baseball, i'm your only shot."
41900,Lisa,"dad, i'm calling about the school talent show."
50092,Lisa,thanks. you can be the free safety.
41902,Lisa,"i called her. she's not home. i also tried mr. flanders, aunt patty, aunt selma, dr. hibbert, reverend lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement."
50093,Lisa,i mean the point guard.
50095,Lisa,don't call me honey pie.
41907,Lisa,i forgive you.
50099,Lisa,does anyone here actually know anything about baseball?
41909,Lisa,"i love you, dad!"
41910,Lisa,snowball ii... santa's little helper... this is princess. please don't exclude her because she's different.
41913,Lisa,"father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived."
41914,Lisa,"wait, dad, i've got something for you."
50107,Lisa,"well, there's a ninety-seven percent chance i'm not, so do what i say."
50110,Lisa,"here's what: you're off the team! get him outta here, boys."
50111,Lisa,"c'mon, guys. i had to get rid of bart."
50112,Lisa,that dinger was a fluke! not that i have to defend myself to you. managers manage and players play.
41924,Lisa,i'll never forget you.
41925,Lisa,"dad, you don't have to do this."
50118,Lisa,i need you! ralph can't play 'cause he's too juiced.
41936,Lisa,you should smell his room.
50129,Lisa,can you put a number on it?
50130,Lisa,awww...
50131,Lisa,"well, my latin's a little rusty, but i think to get everything back in its box, you have to finish the game."
41942,Lisa,"when bart's done, can we moe to the moevies? there's a moetinee."
50138,Lisa,"you're a vampire! i should be scared, but i'm not."
41949,Lisa,what?
50143,Lisa,"eight forever? whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! i can't spend eternity using kid scissors. they barely cut anything!"
41952,Lisa,doesn't mom do that stuff?
50150,Lisa,principal skinner? quick question. is it true my mom was a great student?
41960,Lisa,"dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars."
50153,Lisa,"mom's looking good through elementary school... ninth grade, tenth grade, still ridin' the a-train... then suddenly, when she was a high school senior blam!"
41962,Lisa,"i dreamed i was married to corey, and we lived on a pony farm...and corey was always walking around with his shirt off."
41965,Lisa,how does that make him a hero?
41966,Lisa,awww.
50163,Lisa,"mom, i admire everything you do--"
50164,Lisa,it's plenty good! it's great! it's just... not for me.
50165,Lisa,what kind of kiss did you get?
50167,Lisa,oh yeah?
50173,Lisa,dad was right -- i might as well give up.
41982,Lisa,whoo-hoo!
50175,Lisa,"lord buddha, i know i'm not supposed to want stuff, but c'mon."
41984,Lisa,you mean you made a bet?
50178,Lisa,"i have a future! thank you, mom!"
50185,Lisa,self-published?
41995,Lisa,he'll lose.
41998,Lisa,"dad, i hate to break the mood, but i'm getting nauseous."
41999,Lisa,"well, i like the 49ers because they're pure of heart -- seattle because they got something to prove -- and the raiders because they always cheat."
50190,Lisa,mom... i don't want to go to that school.
50192,Lisa,"i don't know! they won't tell me! and besides... you were willing to do all this just so i would be happy! mom, i'd be honored if i turned out like you."
42005,Lisa,"mom, can't a man do something nice for his loved ones?"
42010,Lisa,"oh dad, you must've bought me every malibu stacey accessory there is."
50202,Lisa,"a little tired of revenge, are we?"
42015,Lisa,give me some chips for it.
50211,Lisa,like those chairs in the music room?
42020,Lisa,"so you've come to buy my forgiveness. sorry, homer."
42025,Lisa,i think dallas is a mortal lock.
50217,Lisa,"looks like you're gonna have to take care of him, bart."
50218,Lisa,"no, no... listen, don't tell anyone, but... i can't stand pigeons! they're like rats with wings!"
42028,Lisa,i don't know.
50219,Lisa,"oh... okay, maybe he's not so bad."
50221,Lisa,"mom, it's just maggie."
50223,Lisa,"i'm a member of people for the ethical treatment of amoebas, the league of women vultures, the n-double-a-c-porcupines, kids for squids, the a.c.l. unicorns, clamnesty international and, uh... well, those are the best ones."
42033,Lisa,isn't it though?
42034,Lisa,"don't even bother with the raisins. i'm not gonna eat 'em... double bologna! double bologna!... i don't ask for much, just no pimento. don't forget to make it double bologna 'cause i can hardly..."
50226,Lisa,it's amazing how i can feel sorry for you and hate you at the same time. i'm sure there's a german word for it.
42040,Lisa,wish i'd thought of that.
42042,Lisa,i'm aware of the time.
50234,Lisa,"oh, i know what you're after. the toy you never got."
42047,Lisa,uh-um.
42052,Lisa,yeah?
50247,Lisa,"yes, but then i learned that there's always hope. someday this war will be over. someday our mom will be back."
42059,Lisa,maybe we should write her another letter. one that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
42060,Lisa,"""though i'll be inoculating babies in kampuchea, my heart will always be with you."""
42063,Lisa,"wow, dad."
50262,Lisa,dad's underwear!
42076,Lisa,but i'll practice every day!
42077,Lisa,"you're wrong, you're wrong! you don't need long fingers to play the blues. the blues come from in here!"
42082,Lisa,i quit.
42083,Lisa,"if you think it's so great, why don't you join the band?"
42084,Lisa,"janey, i'm about ready to chuck the whole stinking alphabet."
50275,Lisa,"maybe if you buckle down and get good grades, dad will give you money."
50279,Lisa,"oh my god, me too!"
50280,Lisa,i can't take it. i'm just going to draw a hairline on.
50284,Lisa,"mom, your choice to go back to blue is so empowering."
50292,Lisa,"many great directors, like wes anderson, frank tashlin, and tim burton started with short films."
50296,Lisa,"good luck, mr. park. there'd be no shame in losing to you."
42105,Lisa,"but, mom, next week is volume four: copernicus through elephantiasis."
50299,Lisa,they calm down when they're near the springfield silvertongues!
42108,Lisa,here santa's little helper!
50302,Lisa,"that doesn't seem fair -- they won't let him escape, then they kick him out. i wonder where he'll go."
50309,Lisa,...and that's why you're acting so sweet and kind. because dad drugged you!
50315,Lisa,i'm sorry i was so stubborn. i hope you're not mad.
50317,Lisa,"let me finish: thanks to your wonderful, wonderful drug."
42127,Lisa,i'se just jammin' with you.
50321,Lisa,cheech and chong are from springfield?
50323,Lisa,the noisy minority... the upside-down bubblegum collective... the regional lampoon... the plymouth grok experiment... fro and flo... allan sherman's helter shmelter...
42132,Lisa,i gotta help him.
50327,Lisa,"you mean, just reality."
50331,Lisa,"wow! i know i lay down in front of bulldozers to stop this stadium from being built, but i have to admit, it's pretty sweet."
50335,Lisa,that was kind of the same as the first time.
42144,Lisa,i stand corrected.
50336,Lisa,why did i suggest this?
42146,Lisa,dad? dad?
42147,Lisa,unky herb!
42148,Lisa,"why didn't you write, unky herb?"
50340,Lisa,roger.
42152,Lisa,"well, i think we should invest in a set of the great books of western civilization. look at this ad from ""new republic for kids."" each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: ""paradise regained,"" ""martin chuzzlewit,"" or herman melville's twin classics ""omoo"" and ""typee""."
42153,Lisa,maggie! maggie!
50347,Lisa,sounds like most of the house is still owned by the bank.
50350,Lisa,looks like there was magic between you two.
42163,Lisa,"a+! oh, bart, why didn't you at least forge plausible grades?"
42164,Lisa,"before i go to camp, i'll need boosters for malaria, german measles, encephalitis, hansen's disease..."
50358,Lisa,need some help?
42167,Lisa,"if the pets die, don't replace them. i'll know!"
42172,Lisa,i meant soon.
42177,Lisa,but i am far more pessimistic.
42178,Lisa,i am not sure if this letter will reach you as our lines of communication have been cut.
50370,Lisa,"shut up! now, where were we?"
42181,Lisa,kowalski!
42185,Lisa,"oh yeah? who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom, ""president clown""?"
42186,Lisa,"it is the real krusty. look at that pacemaker scar, the cattle skull birthmark, and his famous superfluous nipple."
50380,Lisa,i'll get him out!
50382,Lisa,he's going to die!
50389,Lisa,"sold, to the lowest bidder!"
42201,Lisa,nothing.
50394,Lisa,"bart, this is a truffle."
42207,Lisa,"dad, do you think i'm ugly?"
42211,Lisa,i'm hideous.
42212,Lisa,so you think i'm ugly?
42218,Lisa,i'll do it.
50413,Lisa,cool! / awesome!
42226,Lisa,do you really think i can win?
42230,Lisa,"thanks, dad."
42231,Lisa,"some people say that to love your country is old fashioned, uncool, real melvin... well to them i say oh beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain..."
50422,Lisa,taffy's up to something. and i won't find out what it is sitting at a computer. it's time to get boots on the ground.
42236,Lisa,hi fellas.
50432,Lisa,what's this key with the plastic skull for?
50434,Lisa,i'll return this to the school.
42243,Lisa,"dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?"
50440,Lisa,get thee behind me namuche! that's the buddhist satan. let's give it a shot.
42249,Lisa,"bart, please. don't you remember that snowball i died four years ago tonight? run over by the mayor's beer swilling brother, clovis."
42254,Lisa,uh huh.
42255,Lisa,wait bart! maybe the library has another book that'll reverse the spell.
42256,Lisa,"hurry, bart!"
50450,Lisa,i swear there was a room here!
50451,Lisa,"i've got to get back in that room, but skinner took away the only key! what would nancy drew do?"
50455,Lisa,keep the change.
42265,Lisa,it wasn't that great.
50457,Lisa,"what do you think of that, nancy drew?"
50459,Lisa,the children are on bus 23.
50460,Lisa,skinner's involved in this. deep.
50462,Lisa,"there's only one bed that's just right for me, the bed with the truth in it. which is probably the third one."
50463,Lisa,so the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge.
42273,Lisa,i think it's wonderful. mom and dad side by side at the power plant. you'll be just like marie and pierre curie.
50466,Lisa,that's not a real arm -- it's plastic!
50470,Lisa,"otto, they're just mannequins!"
50471,Lisa,"well, there's one thing you didn't count on: my dad getting a giant wedding cake and my sister locking herself in the car."
42280,Lisa,daad!
50475,Lisa,i like routine. i like routine.
42285,Lisa,i don't care. ask hef over there.
50486,Lisa,oh my god! do you realize what this means?
50488,Lisa,exactly!
50498,Lisa,all strapped in?
42310,Lisa,bart. bart bart bart bart bart.
42313,Lisa,"ha, ha. mom yelled at you."
50505,Lisa,that's pathetic.
50507,Lisa,it's about an asteroid!
42324,Lisa,"no, mom, it's very reassuring. and i've learned a great deal from this cow's heart i got at the butcher shop."
50517,Lisa,are there at least games here?
50520,Lisa,"mom, we're hungry!"
42332,Lisa,mr. lanley! aren't you gonna ride the monorail?
42335,Lisa,we're under six!
42336,Lisa,we understand.
42338,Lisa,... nine... ten...
50530,Lisa,people are loving our list of springfield's top ninety-nine afghan restaurants.
50531,Lisa,whoa! / cool!
50533,Lisa,food dad! food dad! food dad!
42342,Lisa,yayyy!
50541,Lisa,no fair!
42352,Lisa,"ahhh, i can see the music."
50545,Lisa,but why are you working at a dinosaur show? and why did you run away from me? and how did angelica get a new wand after baron mortdeath burned the wandwood forest? and--
50555,Lisa,"this is how real writers do it. i'll just bang out two thousand words and then i'll stop, even if i'm on fire. i gotta pace myself. ""chapter one."" wait, i can't start without music to inspire me."
50556,Lisa,why is bach next to muddy waters? that's my problem -- i gotta get these cds organized!
42366,Lisa,i made it!
42368,Lisa,isn't that just pointless busywork?
50560,Lisa,"god, i love being a writer!"
50561,Lisa,i've got it! a mermaid falls in love with a boy on land... i'm a genius!
50563,Lisa,coming to the book fair was a great idea... 'cause you can't write if you don't know what the competition's up to!
42376,Lisa,ralph thinks i like him. but i only gave him a valentine 'cause i felt sorry for him.
42385,Lisa,"oh, a malibu stacy convertible! ""look in the tunk."" he must mean trunk."
50577,Lisa,i secretly switched the flash drives.
42387,Lisa,i'm not sure i should go. i don't even like him.
50578,Lisa,i got the idea from every movie ever made.
50581,Lisa,krappy the klunk.
42395,Lisa,eiw.
50587,Lisa,patience! patience! get on with it!
42399,Lisa,noooo!!
50593,Lisa,"um, i think we're supposed to get off here."
50595,Lisa,"mo-om, what are you doing?"
50596,Lisa,why can't we visit a real museum? one that doesn't have the skeletons of the three stooges in the lobby?
50601,Lisa,"you're not licked, krusty. people love a comeback. look at robert downey junior... mickey rourke..."
42412,Lisa,first prize... first prize...
50604,Lisa,um... who says we're gonna have kids of our own?
42414,Lisa,i've grown a futuristic tomato by fertilizing it with anabolic steroids.
42417,Lisa,bart!!!!!
50609,Lisa,it's too early to call shotgun!
42420,Lisa,i want the most intelligent hamster you've got.
50612,Lisa,"so, what's this with the gravy boat?"
42422,Lisa,"oh, come on."
42425,Lisa,hamster one... bart... zero.
50618,Lisa,no question about it.
42427,Lisa,the hamster has learned a valuable lesson. beware the hand of man.
50622,Lisa,"maybe because deep down, you know you don't believe in what you're doing."
42433,Lisa,oh no. i'll be socially unpopular. more so.
50625,Lisa,"like all too many stories about my family, it began with somebody watching television."
42435,Lisa,do you think you can get the dental plan back?
50626,Lisa,"hm, i kinda want to create my own thing. do you sell any just plain sets?"
42439,Lisa,come gather 'round children / it's high-time ye learns / 'bout a hero named homer / and a devil named burns / we'll march till we drop / the girls and the fellas / will fight till the death or else fold like umbrellas
50631,Lisa,they-they don't?
42444,Lisa,april first used to be the pagan new year.
42447,Lisa,dad! i was telling the story.
50639,Lisa,all right already! i had no friends.
42449,Lisa,so did mine.
42456,Lisa,"hi, dad. want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
42457,Lisa,why?
42458,Lisa,"i wrote this for you, dad."
50649,Lisa,"wow, i've created something incredibly popular!"
42460,Lisa,we're a family again!
50652,Lisa,"i have a thousand friends, and i feel more alone than ever!"
42462,Lisa,it's so sad that krusty is ashamed of his roots.
50656,Lisa,fine. i'll shut down the site.
42469,Lisa,great.
42470,Lisa,scratchy is getting a haircut. then itchy -- the barber -- chops scratchy's head off with a razor!
50663,Lisa,"sorry, sorry, i didn't mean to be nosey."
50664,Lisa,you have a way with words.
42475,Lisa,"bart, they rejected our script."
50668,Lisa,lisa. now this is the most important place in the world.
50669,Lisa,"this place is great! if i cover my peripheral vision, i feel like i'm in france!"
42478,Lisa,"grampa, how'd you take off your underwear without taking off your pants?"
42491,Lisa,but killing snakes is evil.
42494,Lisa,"dad, everyone likes whacking day, but i hate it. is there something wrong with me?"
50686,Lisa,i thought you rowed up the zambezi without a guide.
50687,Lisa,"you know, you were a lot more adventurous at the dessert table."
42500,Lisa,if the snakes were in here we could protect them.
50693,Lisa,"again, i maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance."
42502,Lisa,"mr. white, can we borrow you for a minute?"
50697,Lisa,"if i didn't know better, i'd say it was a town meeting."
42506,Lisa,"mom, can you bring me more o.j.?"
50700,Lisa,"ahhh, smell that unpolluted air! y'know, i'm glad we're in exile."
50703,Lisa,"maureen dowd, we've got a lot of catching up to do."
42512,Lisa,you're a latter-day clarence darrow.
50707,Lisa,by who? lenny?
50708,Lisa,they have jellies made of fruits i've never heard of!
50711,Lisa,wait! maybe paula paul left a message.
42522,Lisa,"two wrongs don't make a right, bart."
42523,Lisa,no they don't.
42524,Lisa,no they don't.
50716,Lisa,you're an undercover cop?
50719,Lisa,"listen, everyone! we should fall asleep in this dream! one minute at this level equals two hours one dream level below!"
42528,Lisa,"miss midler, i can't believe you do this all by yourself."
50721,Lisa,"forsooth, a myst'ry-"
50723,Lisa,gramma!
42539,Lisa,dean martin still packs 'em in.
42542,Lisa,the fox network has sunk to a new low.
42543,Lisa,"it's from my pen pal, anya!"
42544,Lisa,"bart, what's wrong with you?"
50734,Lisa,"i've been following your storyline from afar, bart, waiting for that inevitable point where you get into trouble you couldn't get out of. perhaps i could broker a settlement."
42546,Lisa,yeah!
50744,Lisa,two!?!!!
42555,Lisa,"dad, don't let these application essays throw you. let's see... ""list your three favorite books and how they've influenced your life."""
50749,Lisa,"bart, how could you?"
42559,Lisa,"dad, nerds are nothing to fear. in fact they've done some pretty memorable things. some nerds of note include; popcorn magnate, orville redenbacher, rock star, david byrne and supreme court justice david souter."
50752,Lisa,"hey, up here! you've gotta see this!"
50754,Lisa,"well sure life is full of pain and drudgery, but the trick is to enjoy the few perfect experiences we're given in the moment."
42564,Lisa,the tv! the tv!
42567,Lisa,"actually, mom, a tweaking of mr. burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn dad a special place in the old man's heart."
42568,Lisa,does either of you know what incontinent means?
42569,Lisa,i'd like to believe that this time. i really would.
50759,Lisa,i just want closure.
50763,Lisa,"well, he's tough on nerds, but easy on the eyes."
50764,Lisa,nothing.
42579,Lisa,"excuse me, bart's a little upset this morning, so could everyone please be extra-nice to him?"
42587,Lisa,satisfied?
50781,Lisa,"let's see... ""uncensored jump-rope chants""... oh, there's a whole thread labeled ""lisa simpson!"""
50783,Lisa,yep. message boards are never wrong.
50784,Lisa,dutch?
42596,Lisa,you must drive this stake right through his heart.
50791,Lisa,"look, if i could just spend a few days in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up, i think i might have a chance to..."
42601,Lisa,you're the head vampire?
50796,Lisa,oh god.
42607,Lisa,"hey, dad, i think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter."
50799,Lisa,solitude?
42613,Lisa,"dad, this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering."
50806,Lisa,i denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill! and i denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy!
42616,Lisa,are you mad?
42618,Lisa,what!?
50811,Lisa,gaga!
42621,Lisa,"it's simple, bart. you've defined yourself as a rebel. and in the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted."
50813,Lisa,"look at me! you did help me, by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you. it was like a great sneeze. and now i can say what's good about me. and i can say it as lisa simpson! just not that loud."
50816,Lisa,"i used to think that i was stupid, worthless, weak, and wrong"
42628,Lisa,"the few, the proud, the geeky."
50822,Lisa,"that's right, i'm lisa simpson, superstar!"
50823,Lisa,lisa simpson / lisa simpson
50826,Lisa,lisa simpson superstar!
42637,Lisa,gimme those.
50832,Lisa,hey bart? at least i've got a date!
50834,Lisa,but...
42645,Lisa,maybe mom just doesn't realize we miss her. we could go down to the casino and let her know.
42648,Lisa,"well, i know it's absurd, but i dreamed the boogeyman was after me and he's hiding..."
42649,Lisa,does this mean you'll help me with my costume?
50840,Lisa,"all right, broadway's too expensive, the museums are over-curated -- but shakespeare in the park is tonight, and the tickets are free!"
50841,Lisa,"not so fast! we came for shakespeare, and we're gonna see shakespeare!"
50842,Lisa,"anyone who wants to be in this, grab a doublet and meet me backstage!"
50844,Lisa,"fine, you're in."
42665,Lisa,"dad, maybe this will cheer you up."
50857,Lisa,"dad, don't pat it!"
50865,Lisa,but--
42674,Lisa,impaled on my nobel peace prize. how ironic.
50869,Lisa,not the favorite! not the favorite!
42678,Lisa,but inside it's mostly about ross perot. and the last two chapters are excerpts from the oliver north trial.
50872,Lisa,"i think it's ""new car smell."""
50873,Lisa,bart! what are you doing in my room?!
42684,Lisa,"dad, are you listening to me?"
42686,Lisa,mmm corn. haven't had that in awhile.
50880,Lisa,i hope you're happy. you all just wasted your time working your way into an afterschool class.
42697,Lisa,awww.
42698,Lisa,awww.
42699,Lisa,"thanks. ""mr. simpson. stop. your constant letters are becoming a nuisance. stop. if you do not cease, i will be forced to pursue legal action. stop. signed, boris karloff, hollywood, california."""
50892,Lisa,four queens! yes! yes!!!
42701,Lisa,"hey, horse-face! git yer ugly pie-hooks off that summer fun set!"
50897,Lisa,how did he...
42713,Lisa,"is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by malibu stacy intentional, or is it just a horrible mistake?"
42727,Lisa,"but if you can learn from malibu stacy's mistakes, so can everyone. i'm sure we can think of something together. c'mon!"
42728,Lisa,"no you're not! uh, i'll come back tomorrow."
42732,Lisa,"""...when i get married, i'm keeping my own name."" you know, that should probably be if i choose to get married."
42735,Lisa,this is great! they're really gonna sell our doll.
50928,Lisa,nooo!
50929,Lisa,nooo!
42738,Lisa,wait! don't be fooled! she's just a regular malibu stacy with a stupid cheap hat! she still embodies all the awful stereotypes she did before.
42739,Lisa,"well, i guess you can't beat big business. there's just no room for the little guy."
42741,Lisa,what?
50933,Lisa,i'll be cool.
50940,Lisa,"dad, check this out!"
42753,Lisa,"hi, mom."
50950,Lisa,"check it out, the new york times travel section just named springfield ""america's coolest city."""
50951,Lisa,"please, please take me with you! i am one of you! i understood all your references!"
42760,Lisa,you ate it too fast.
42761,Lisa,"you can't do that, dad. it's cruel."
42766,Lisa,"yeah well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels."
42768,Lisa,"dad, i think he's an ivory dealer. his boots are ivory, his hat is ivory, and i'm pretty sure that check is ivory."
50961,Lisa,wait. how could you know what herman said? you were driving away.
50963,Lisa,"grampa, why is the saddest story you ever told the only one that's ever made sense?"
50965,Lisa,"whatcha reading, dad?"
42780,Lisa,i propose to you that your heir need not be a boy. in this phallocentric society of ours...
42782,Lisa,it couldn't possibly be bottomless.
50975,Lisa,"wait a minute... if you take the test now, your score could raise the average and save the school!"
50977,Lisa,it's bart.
42786,Lisa,"yeah, me too. that midget taught me a lot about his native estonia."
42790,Lisa,that's guilt. you feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job.
50982,Lisa,"look, the thing is, it's more important to know how to take a test than knowing what's on it. so, do the ones you know first. if you don't know one, guess b and move on. now, what is the capital of massachusetts?"
42792,Lisa,"i think you need skinner, bart. everybody needs a nemesis. sherlock holmes had his dr. moriarty. mountain dew has its mello-yello. even maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow."
42793,Lisa,"they're not ""imprisoning us,"" bart. they're..."
50985,Lisa,they're miserable.
42795,Lisa,you started off as the bad cop. but now you're the good one. you and willie got mixed up about ten minutes ago.
42796,Lisa,now you're the good cop.
42797,Lisa,how do you know? there weren't any witnesses.
42800,Lisa,why?
42801,Lisa,"oh, i see. if you testify, skinner will know you skipped school. well, if freddy quimby didn't do it, i'm sure he'll be found innocent by a fair and impartial jury."
42812,Lisa,tough kids...
42816,Lisa,yeesh. how much was it?
42817,Lisa,oooh.
42819,Lisa,sneh.
42828,Lisa,no.
51020,Lisa,really? who?
42839,Lisa,"yes, dad."
42840,Lisa,"oh, look. bart's all alone. maybe i should keep him company, at least for a little while."
51031,Lisa,kirk? don't you have something to tell her?
42842,Lisa,"dad... you have to put chlorine in the water every day, to keep it clean."
42843,Lisa,"uh, bart...?"
51034,Lisa,i've got perfume spritzers.
51035,Lisa,property of abraham j. simpson? this is grampa's stuff!
42847,Lisa,"oh, well, y'know, it ain't so great. bart, it's the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole life! well, anyway, i brought you a present."
42852,Lisa,"hello? hey, i'm stuck in here. i gotta think of a way to get out."
51045,Lisa,confident... vassar sticker on the windshield... could it be... do i detect... enthusiasm?!
51046,Lisa,she's brought her own orrery!
51049,Lisa,"lisa simpson, hi. as second grade student-faculty liaison, i'd like to welcome you-"
42860,Lisa,fine. i'll play outside.
42862,Lisa,ooh! ooh!
51055,Lisa,the joeys go in feet first!
51063,Lisa,"""ann, mark, bill and sally are on the ferris wheel. ann is behind sally. mark is in front of bill."
42872,Lisa,"me, too."
51065,Lisa,eleanor roosevelt became franklin's 'eyes and ears...'
51066,Lisa,i have a bully at school.
42879,Lisa,what's happening... oh... it was just a dream.
51073,Lisa,"ms. cantwell, i can make this stop. all you have to do is... like me."
42884,Lisa,"i can't tell you either, ralph."
42888,Lisa,"hey, i am above average! so what if allison's ahead of me? there's no shame in being second."
51082,Lisa,"to prove my brother's innocence, i demand a youth court!"
51088,Lisa,objection! prejudicial!
51089,Lisa,she sustained me!
51092,Lisa,no further questions.
42905,Lisa,perfect!
51097,Lisa,just remember this: a simpson never gives up.
42908,Lisa,"why, here's allison's real diorama. it got misplaced, ...or so it would seem."
42916,Lisa,"mom, romance is dead. it was acquired in a hostile takeover by hallmark and disney. homogenized, then sold off piece by piece."
42920,Lisa,poor ralph.
51113,Lisa,milhouse? got anything good?
51115,Lisa,"oh. okay. if you'll excuse me, i have to go think of you in a different light."
51117,Lisa,i just have one thing to say...
42926,Lisa,"well, here's my house."
42928,Lisa,"oh, a malibu stacy convertible! ""look in the tunk."" he must mean trunk."
51120,Lisa,"milhouse, you'll probably think this is lame, but i was gonna go for a nature walk after school and i thought maybe you'd like to..."
42932,Lisa,oh no. please don't show me with ralph.
42934,Lisa,"now you listen to me -- i don't like you. i never liked you, and the only reason i gave you that stupid valentine is 'cause nobody else would!"
42936,Lisa,that didn't seem like a happy ending.
51128,Lisa,"milhouse, are you okay?"
42938,Lisa,"sorry, mom. i've decided to save my love for someone who is guaranteed not to reject me."
42942,Lisa,can we?
42943,Lisa,yayyyyyy!
51142,Lisa,"i staked out the alley and befriended the garbage man who took it. then he gave it to a local theater company, who used it in the first unsuccessful version of ""mamma mia."" in a bankruptcy sale, it was bought by a young couple. that couple right there!"
51148,Lisa,"it's a hologram?! well, maybe if it's in good taste..."
51155,Lisa,"so you're saying moe's dumbo, his bourbon is the giant ears, and we're that flock of racist crows?"
42965,Lisa,"but mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation. it brought us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors, and we have so many memories."
42966,Lisa,"no, mom. he's right. observe."
42967,Lisa,"i don't like him either mom, but i'm doing a report on local politics for my school project."
51159,Lisa,"i guess bart must be a musical genius, because frauds are always found out. always."
51168,Lisa,pill attack!
51169,Lisa,ki-ya--
51178,Lisa,wait... you named me after a train?
42993,Lisa,"because we all know you're a naive pawn, puppet, if you will, of the most diabolical political genius springfield has ever known -- birchibald t. barlow!"
51189,Lisa,that's not right.
51190,Lisa,hey!
51202,Lisa,he's targeting the nuclear plant?!
51203,Lisa,mom! i have to tell you something about dad! something big!
43012,Lisa,chorus line of people / dancin' till they make us stop /
51204,Lisa,exactly!
43017,Lisa,you gotta give her up.
51209,Lisa,nothing really.
51211,Lisa,when what's all over?!
43024,Lisa,"i know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof. but doesn't the bible teach us ""judge not lest ye be judged,"" reverend?"
43025,Lisa,"there is someone among us with a guilty conscience. after much soul searching i decided it would be wrong of me to name names, but i urge that guilty person here, under the eyes of god, to come forward to confess and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell."
43026,Lisa,i am talking to the collection money thief. only you can come forward and end this injustice.
51216,Lisa,is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me?
43028,Lisa,"if you search her room, i am certain you will find the money."
43030,Lisa,snowball fight!
51222,Lisa,"we did it, dad. we did it."
51224,Lisa,"you know, dad, just because your mission's complete, it doesn't mean you have to go back to pork eating, and beer-drinking..."
43033,Lisa,gym?!! that's the stupidest thing i ever heard.
43037,Lisa,ooooh.
51229,Lisa,"say, mr. hat, i don't mean to complain, but you promised us candy, not mayhem and pain."
43040,Lisa,"i have to join the team, or i'll get an ""f"" that will haunt me for the rest of my life."
43043,Lisa,"you really think i did okay out there, mom?"
51239,Lisa,"rainbow... oh, rainbow..."
43052,Lisa,that doesn't make sense.
43056,Lisa,"you'll have to do better than that tonight, chump."
51249,Lisa,maybe the best way to keep students from cheating is to trust them not to cheat.
51258,Lisa,"no, this is good."
43067,Lisa,i'm coming!
51261,Lisa,is bart cheating?
51262,Lisa,bart! i'm gonna tell!
51265,Lisa,a word you should know since it was on a vocabulary test you aced.
51271,Lisa,american football.
43080,Lisa,"yeah, i hope it's as exciting as his other book ""rational thinking: reasonable future!"""
43081,Lisa,"oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy."
51275,Lisa,i can't believe he pays you so little. the crowd was crazy about you.
43084,Lisa,"i don't know. maybe they're all reverse vampires, and they have to get home before dark."
51279,Lisa,"we're gonna push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em way, way back! all the way to a new con-tract! 'cause union power is a fact! and we're..."
43094,Lisa,"mom, are you feeling any better?"
43096,Lisa,"but if we don't encourage her to vent her feelings, they can come out in other ways."
51289,Lisa,one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do...
43098,Lisa,"mom, can we talk to you?"
51296,Lisa,"well, you're never alone surrounded by ""the autobiography of charles manson."""
43106,Lisa,"danger, danger... my hooks are flailing wildly!"
43109,Lisa,"you don't know what they do there, do you?"
43114,Lisa,"dad, i know you think you're happy now, but it's not gonna last forever."
43115,Lisa,don't you see? getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
43116,Lisa,"dad, you're not with the stonecutters now. there are no lackeys around to carry out your every..."
43117,Lisa,you're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.
51307,Lisa,f.d.r.'s steadfast leadership also helped america win world war two...
51310,Lisa,first president bush?
43124,Lisa,why aren't there any pictures of maggie?
51318,Lisa,you voted for reagan?!
51319,Lisa,so... you were going through a phase?
43131,Lisa,"you're worried about telling dad, aren't you, mom?"
43132,Lisa,"well, you've been in my room for about four hours now."
51324,Lisa,"just can't resist those words ""signup sheet."" oh, looks like i'll be running against isabel. and ralph?!"
43138,Lisa,what!?
43147,Lisa,it's breaking up!
43148,Lisa,we're saved!
51346,Lisa,"but what liberal really means, is someone who believes that those who have more than enough should share a little with those who don't."
51347,Lisa,and those principles have consistently been in place during this country's most prosperous times. so if that's a liberal then i am a liberal... and hang me.
51349,Lisa,what about obama? harry truman? bill clinton?
43165,Lisa,"office of the solicitor general? ""office of the prime minister?"" ""hopping mad collection agency?"" what is all this stuff?"
51358,Lisa,they find me a pointy-haired know-it-all.
51359,Lisa,what are you getting at?
43170,Lisa,"bart, i'm sorry i'm gonna miss your public humiliation, but the woolumbaloo dirt monument is just too exciting to pass up."
51368,Lisa,"what i'm saying is, you could produce foreign versions of your tv show with actors from other countries..."
51371,Lisa,that sermon really inspired me. this whole christmas has been about money...
43180,Lisa,"dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival."
51381,Lisa,"i know this christmas has been a little rocky even for the simpsons. but i think these gifts born of thought and love will restore the balance of prajna and samsara, i mean holly and jolly."
51382,Lisa,"now dad, i'd like to give you your present."
51383,Lisa,"even better! they're bags of seeds, so that you can plant a garden and watch it grow."
43192,Lisa,wow. how many pulitzer prizes winners can do that?
51385,Lisa,"well, at least you're eating vegetables."
51386,Lisa,"okay bart, open your present. it's the one i'm most excited about."
43199,Lisa,"sorry, i don't believe in fortune telling. i should go."
43202,Lisa,"oh, that's cute."
51398,Lisa,"if bart's going, i'm going!"
51405,Lisa,thanks for taking us in. our family always appreciates asylum.
51408,Lisa,these people hate my dad. how can they want to make a movie about him?
43223,Lisa,"this place is so enchanting, hugh. i love it here."
43225,Lisa,hi mom.
51417,Lisa,so the rumors are true: moms can want things.
51418,Lisa,"hi, ralph... um, i just wanted to tell you there was a tooth in the valentine you gave me."
43231,Lisa,"it's not you, milhouse. i just don't plan to ever get married."
51424,Lisa,that doesn't sound like you.
43233,Lisa,just a couple more blocks to my house.
43239,Lisa,hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
43240,Lisa,"all right, dad! i'm sorry i left you alone with homer and bart."
51431,Lisa,miss hoover?
51439,Lisa,um... that video seemed a little... unscientific.
43252,Lisa,well?
51444,Lisa,and i refuse to concede a mind that thinks so much like mine can be all bad. mom?
43257,Lisa,are you saying we won't see my family again?
43258,Lisa,i can't believe i'm hearing this. i don't want to cut my family out of my life.
51450,Lisa,"bob, there's one thing i've gotta know: are you plotting revenge?"
51452,Lisa,you already ate all the chocolate bars.
51454,Lisa,bob! you saved me! but how did you get the strength? calder's work in this period was marked by heavy use of sheet metal painted to look deceptively airy.
51455,Lisa,thank you. answer the question.
43264,Lisa,wow!
51457,Lisa,you've been changing your dna?!
51458,Lisa,so... how strong are you?
43273,Lisa,how many more can there be?
51465,Lisa,what? no!
51467,Lisa,mom! dad! the retirement home lost its license and grampa has nowhere to live!
43281,Lisa,who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent little puppies?
43288,Lisa,no bart! what're you doing?
51480,Lisa,"that one's fur looks like a tuxedo! a band-aid on its tail, awww! albino!"
51483,Lisa,i just wish the grey one had the brown one's personality!
43292,Lisa,"quick, let's get..."
51485,Lisa,"okay, this is the guinea pig that will make me happy."
43294,Lisa,"no, don't! stay down, monty! don't get up! stay down! stay down, boy!"
51486,Lisa,i could get two...?
43296,Lisa,"well, mr. burns, i hope you've realized the folly of killing innocent animals for fashion."
51488,Lisa,"peruvian feather grass, an incan sleeping mat, and a portrait of marisol espinoza, the vice president of peru."
51491,Lisa,nooooo!
51494,Lisa,i've lost my guinea pig!
43307,Lisa,"grade me! look at me! evaluate and rank me! oh -- i'm good, good, good, and oh so smart! grade me!"
51501,Lisa,hmm... this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy.
51502,Lisa,yes we do. it's a johan oldenveldt.
43311,Lisa,"mom, i think he's serious."
51503,Lisa,what?
51506,Lisa,what!?
43315,Lisa,it's been a long time.
51509,Lisa,"madame curie, we just might have this one in the bag."
43319,Lisa,he'll be fine.
43320,Lisa,what about your family?
43323,Lisa,your sax! thank you so much!
43327,Lisa,"lift me, won't you lift me / above the old routine / make it nice, play it clean, jazzman..."
51522,Lisa,"...and anyone can put a band aid on, but my dad knows how to take it off so it doesn't hurt."
51526,Lisa,"hey, dad."
43335,Lisa,yeah.
43344,Lisa,isn't anybody gonna show up?
51537,Lisa,"wow, the amazon is just like i pictured it after seeing all those pictures online."
43348,Lisa,"mom, i want to honor bleeding gums' memory, but i don't know where to start."
43356,Lisa,i got the album!
51549,Lisa,maybe this isn't the sport for you.
43358,Lisa,"that was for you, bleeding gums."
43359,Lisa,i don't want you to go!
43360,Lisa,good-bye.
43361,Lisa,yay!
43363,Lisa,one more time!
43364,Lisa,"hey mom, is this how you caught him?"
51557,Lisa,just the two of us?
43366,Lisa,"mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to throw yourself in front of him and take the bullet?"
43367,Lisa,"whatever you do, mom, we'll be proud of you."
43371,Lisa,"mom, i know your intentions are good, but aren't the police a protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elites? don't you think we ought to attack the roots of social problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons?"
43372,Lisa,"bust 'im, mom! / get 'im, mom! / nail 'im! / you can do it!"
43374,Lisa,i don't even want any. i just bought a pity glass...
51568,Lisa,hooray.
43380,Lisa,"it is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, bart. and even if the three stooges were alive, i doubt they'd want to hang around with you."
43385,Lisa,he robbed the school of music!
43387,Lisa,"bart, he broke your dog's legs. grampa, he destroyed your home. and dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name."
51580,Lisa,the vintage record store?
51582,Lisa,"it's so much fun to finally have a friend who likes the npr show ""wait wait, don't tell me"" as much as i do."
43392,Lisa,could not!
51606,Lisa,bart won a blue ribbon... but was it worth it?
43417,Lisa,then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to w and s.
43418,Lisa,"or from your point of view, m and s... maggie simpson."
51611,Lisa,fourth of july fireworks were a different story. they meant more to my dad than my mom could ever know.
51612,Lisa,it was the one night of every year that he never heard his parents argue. he figured it was because they loved the fireworks just as much as he did.
43421,Lisa,"wow, mom. you didn't have to go to this much trouble."
51613,Lisa,"with his mom gone, homer needed a hero. and no one was a bigger hero than the magical little man behind the controls."
43423,Lisa,"hey, c'mon! those are prescription shoes! i need them!"
51616,Lisa,"while bart was in hell, homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone."
43436,Lisa,or the way dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips?
43438,Lisa,yay!
43441,Lisa,you're gonna be bart flanders.
51634,Lisa,"bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't. no one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end."
51646,Lisa,one jumbo joe to go!
43461,Lisa,awwww.
43464,Lisa,what's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me?
51658,Lisa,"noble spirits, your time has passed."
51660,Lisa,shut up!
43477,Lisa,come to homer's bbbq. the extra b is for byobb.
51670,Lisa,the first female speaker of the state assembly...
43480,Lisa,it's tomato soup served ice cold!
43481,Lisa,they can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe!
51680,Lisa,"you know, they look a little similar."
43489,Lisa,that's it. i can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore. i am out of here.
43490,Lisa,yes. i'm gonna marry a carrot.
51682,Lisa,"regardless, i see no reason to believe that ""bender"" is from the future. robotic technology today is very advanced."
43492,Lisa,there! is everybody happy now?!
51683,Lisa,it's not my birthday. although maggie's is pretty soon.
43496,Lisa,"wow, a secret staircase? but what do you do if somebody wants a non-alcoholic beer?"
43501,Lisa,ewwww.
43502,Lisa,"when will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains, and cheese?"
51693,Lisa,"dad, we have beer in our time!"
51695,Lisa,"they're evolving! wow. that's a first for you, bart."
51697,Lisa,why are you wearing your hat at dinner?
43510,Lisa,"i still stand by my beliefs, but i can't defend what i did. i'm sorry i messed up your barbecue."
43511,Lisa,"hey, what's that in his footprint?"
51704,Lisa,oh! yippee! fourth-grade a!
51705,Lisa,gosh... that was a hard sleeping bag to roll up.
51710,Lisa,"oh no! king toot's is closed! dad, you're gonna have to take me to the... big box music store."
43519,Lisa,"don't make us poke your eyes out, dad."
43520,Lisa,"oh my god! bart, groundskeeper willie was in my nightmare, too! but he got me with hedge-clippers!"
43521,Lisa,"mom, dad -- martin died at school today!"
43531,Lisa,"well, we're calling it now."
51725,Lisa,i got a chemistry set!
43540,Lisa,obesity is really unhealthy. any doctor will tell you that.
43542,Lisa,"mom, were you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this?"
51735,Lisa,they revamped this ride because of massive complaints from two people.
51736,Lisa,we have been here six hours and the coolest thing we've done is stand in the cool zone.
51741,Lisa,"are we truly in space? and if so, why?"
51744,Lisa,now what?
43554,Lisa,"i think it's ironic that dad saved the day, while a slimmer man would have fallen to his death."
51750,Lisa,thanks.
51751,Lisa,i thought it was a ball!
51753,Lisa,"now do you see why i'm a vegetarian, dad?"
43567,Lisa,these are the calling cards of a con artist.
43571,Lisa,"dad, do you even know what ""rhetorical"" means?"
51773,Lisa,whoa! looks like our bird house is benefitting from positive word of beak.
51774,Lisa,a bald eagle!
43583,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
51775,Lisa,no! let's take the eagle to shelbyville animal rescue. where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.
43585,Lisa,"ow! c'mon, mom and dad are waiting!"
51776,Lisa,"or, maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild."
51780,Lisa,"hi, i didn't want to miss one more chance to spend time with mr. musk. it is such an honor."
51786,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
43597,Lisa,i'll be lisui... the devil-may-care rocket pilot.
51790,Lisa,i guess humanity wants its change one birdhouse at a time.
51791,Lisa,"hm. for a man who likes electric cars, he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel."
43600,Lisa,"i will do it, bartron. who knows what mysterious forces will be unleashed?"
43609,Lisa,i wanna look at the pets and write things on the typewriters and see if the new dictionaries are in!
51807,Lisa,"hashtag ""springfield pride"" has never ever trend-ed."
43617,Lisa,"red, green, yellow, orange! i remember all of these!"
43618,Lisa,"actually this is one of the nine states where mr. bush claims residency, dad. i wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood."
43626,Lisa,just buy it. you don't have to rationalize everything.
43628,Lisa,the rich are different from you and me.
43631,Lisa,"mom, look! i found something more fun than complaining!"
43632,Lisa,"mom, did you like horses when you were my age? 'cause i heard--"
43635,Lisa,mom! mom! mom! mom! mom!
51827,Lisa,--but she hasn't come home yet and we're worried she's in trouble!
51828,Lisa,i'm telling mom about how the school freezer broke and they had to cook all the tater tots and the teachers took the extra tots home in manila envelopes!
51830,Lisa,i can't believe you're gambling.
51832,Lisa,mom's counting cards at the casino!
51833,Lisa,"but i really want a pony and i've been really, really good this year."
43642,Lisa,"you look nice, is all."
43643,Lisa,"i'm gonna ask people if they know their servants' last names, or, in the case of butlers, their first."
51834,Lisa,"nice try, dad."
43649,Lisa,i got their new thrifty saver savings account. 2.3% annual interest instead of the normal 2.25. so a year from now i'll have an extra nickel.
43650,Lisa,thank you.
43652,Lisa,you gotta hand it to krusty.
51844,Lisa,"well i wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father i have. therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. so i hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me. and i am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts."
43659,Lisa,hey! you've got a pacemaker scar just like krusty!
51852,Lisa,then one foggy christmas eve / santa came to say...
51855,Lisa,nurturing.
43665,Lisa,how about town crier? you'd be great at that.
51859,Lisa,"""id. along with the ego and the superego, one of three components of the psyche."""
43670,Lisa,"--ha ha ha ha ha. oh my god! our town hero is a fraud! ""i write this confession so that my infamy will live on long after my body has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria."""
43675,Lisa,jebediah was really a vicious pirate named hans sprüngfeld. his tongue was bitten off by a turk in a grog house fight!
43679,Lisa,you do?
51875,Lisa,yeah!
43686,Lisa,"hi, mr. hurlbut."
51882,Lisa,"yes, you do!"
43692,Lisa,"hi, apu. can i put this poster in your window?"
43694,Lisa,"jebediah springfield was nothing more than an evil, blood-thirsty pirate who hated this town!"
43695,Lisa,that's a myth that got mixed up with the truth.
43696,Lisa,i hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration for a murderous pirate!
43698,Lisa,yes.
51892,Lisa,amen. let's eat.
51895,Lisa,what are they doing?
51904,Lisa,ogre is such a strong word.
43718,Lisa,"you know, dad, assisting mr. burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
43720,Lisa,"bart, leave simpson alone."
51915,Lisa,"dad, i get good grades 'cause i'm smart and i pay attention and i study hard."
51922,Lisa,"you weren't thinking, were you?"
51925,Lisa,then what am i?
43735,Lisa,you'll get more royalties.
51928,Lisa,"open your mouth, and close your eyes, and you will get a big surprise."
43737,Lisa,i give up. there's nothing we can do.
43738,Lisa,okay.
43740,Lisa,"you're right, mom. i'm sure if we put our minds to it we can solve this one too."
43744,Lisa,"dad, what's a ""muppet?"""
51937,Lisa,he'll give you good advice. he's the toughest simpson alive.
43750,Lisa,bart can take my place at the plant!
43751,Lisa,"well, how about aunt patty and aunt selma at the d.m.v.?"
43753,Lisa,why are there so many burnt-out ones?
51947,Lisa,"in other words, to dodge the ball."
51949,Lisa,"it's not that kind of sad. i'm sorry, dad, but you wouldn't understand."
43759,Lisa,"that's not latin. mom, bart's faking it."
43761,Lisa,sure i would! i can always learn about owls this summer at bird camp.
43762,Lisa,security guards?
51953,Lisa,so typical of bart. all he thinks about is himself.
43765,Lisa,ready!
51957,Lisa,"no, maggie! come here, girl. come to me."
43778,Lisa,nobody does! he's very quiet and enjoys puzzles. but that still doesn't mean you can tell anyone!
51970,Lisa,"yeah, but i don't feel any better."
43784,Lisa,whee.
51978,Lisa,uh-huh.
43790,Lisa,...and bart could be the courier!
51982,Lisa,"okay, mom."
51985,Lisa,no.
51986,Lisa,no.
51987,Lisa,no.
43797,Lisa,gaaah!
43798,Lisa,"no, i've got gum in my hair!"
43800,Lisa,that sounds okay...
51992,Lisa,aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
43802,Lisa,does the whole town have to hear about this?
51993,Lisa,the simpsons have entered the forest.
51998,Lisa,i hope maggie and the boys are all right.
43809,Lisa,"wow, he's even more agitated than usual. maybe we should let him stay."
43816,Lisa,"actually, dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history."
43818,Lisa,"i don't see how you can support proposition 24, dad."
43820,Lisa,"mom, you're the greatest. can i have this licorice?"
43821,Lisa,there was an amnesty declared for people who've been here as long as you! that means you can take the citizenship test!
43823,Lisa,that's it!
52018,Lisa,"does, too."
43830,Lisa,"dad? please just drive the car, dad."
43832,Lisa,"dad, you forgot to pick up milhouse!"
43834,Lisa,"bart, these look real."
43839,Lisa,"it may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd."
52033,Lisa,"ewww, gross."
52034,Lisa,"mom, bart was taking a picture of his butt."
52035,Lisa,yay! fried shrimp!
43846,Lisa,how else would you know?
43848,Lisa,oops.
52040,Lisa,still kinda ticked off.
52048,Lisa,"can, too."
52049,Lisa,"can, too."
52056,Lisa,"bart, i have something to say that's gonna bother me if i don't say it... it's good to see you."
43866,Lisa,exactly.
52060,Lisa,i didn't do it!
43871,Lisa,"hey, a library! no, i can't. that's the old nerdy lisa."
52065,Lisa,"snap out of it, bart. face the facts. all those hours we spent staring at krusty, we were staring at a crook."
43874,Lisa,"like, you know, whatever. like, you know, whatever."
43875,Lisa,"hey, what's hap--"
43876,Lisa,"okay, okay, okay... not your fault, it's a bird thing. you don't control the birds -- you will someday, but not now."
43878,Lisa,a compliment!
52072,Lisa,"don't you remember the get-well card we sent to krusty? it was after his heart attack, when he had a pacemaker put in."
43882,Lisa,didn't. it's lisa.
52087,Lisa,dad dances?
43897,Lisa,my yearbook! no!
52093,Lisa,botz.
43902,Lisa,does this mean you still want to be friends? even though i tried to cover up my nerdish... leanings?
52097,Lisa,i'm calling to report the babysitter bandit. she's in our house right --
52098,Lisa,he isn't.
43907,Lisa,uh huh.
43909,Lisa,no. she's sleeping with
52101,Lisa,"maggie, wanna watch ""the happy little elves"" again?"
52102,Lisa,"okay, but you have to untie me first."
52106,Lisa,"well, okay. i got an a on my vocabulary test."
52110,Lisa,"i heard you last night, bart. you prayed for this. now your prayers have been answered. i'm no theologian. i don't know who or what god is exactly. all i know is he's a force more powerful than mom and dad put together and you owe him big."
43923,Lisa,ow! stupid bart!
43924,Lisa,oh boy! mold! that's science-fair paydirt!
52116,Lisa,is too.
43929,Lisa,"ooo, waffles!"
52122,Lisa,did too.
52123,Lisa,it looks like a vortex -- a gateway into another dimension.
52125,Lisa,i can feel an evil presence in this house.
52127,Lisa,that's okay.
52133,Lisa,heh... heh... heh.
43945,Lisa,"oh, great. i'm stuck in this lousy tub for the rest of my life."
43952,Lisa,oooh!
43953,Lisa,wildflowers! we don't have you in springfield!
52146,Lisa,"it's called, ""the raven."""
43956,Lisa,oh! the whole forest is blooming!
43958,Lisa,"oh, my eyes are burning!"
43961,Lisa,that's an electric nostril groomer.
43963,Lisa,those are the odds they're giving in vegas.
52157,Lisa,"""mr. burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. why are you so popular?"""
52160,Lisa,"oh mom, that felt awful."
43974,Lisa,"da-ad! v-chip, v-chip!"
43976,Lisa,"...and we'd be doing our part for the environment! plus, we'd get to clean up all those cute animals."
52168,Lisa,"but, dad. we're simple people with simple values. capital city is too big and too complex. everyone in springfield knows us and has forgiven us."
43984,Lisa,it's no time for school.
52181,Lisa,our journey begins here at the library.
43990,Lisa,you mean like your poker shack out in the swamp?
52183,Lisa,"hi, ralph."
43992,Lisa,you're very lucky to have mom.
43993,Lisa,"who does nelson think he's impressing, anyway, acting so cool all the time?"
52184,Lisa,"hey, gang. okay, bart, this is the card catalog."
43995,Lisa,it does not!
43996,Lisa,hey!
43997,Lisa,"no, sir. i was laughing at something outside."
52185,Lisa,"let's see, ""golf""... anecdotes, eisenhower and, fashion, humor, japanese obsession with... ah, here it is. putting."
52187,Lisa,"bart, we're just gonna borrow them."
52190,Lisa,become like an uncarved stone.
44001,Lisa,"wow, that was a good idea. and i can't believe it came from nelson."
52193,Lisa,"bart, i have a riddle for you: what's the sound of one hand clapping?"
52194,Lisa,"no, bart. it's a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer. it's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought."
52200,Lisa,dad!
52201,Lisa,eighth hole.
44010,Lisa,i don't know why i like you. i just do. so... what do you think?
44011,Lisa,well... would you like to come over to my house after school?
52202,Lisa,twelfth hole.
52214,Lisa,"it's a tribute to the trailblazing women who made our country great... see, there's georgia o'keefe... susan b. anthony... and this is marjorie stoneman douglas. i'm sure you haven't heard of her, but she worked her whole life to preserve the florida everglades."
44023,Lisa,hardly.
44024,Lisa,how am i supposed to get home?
52215,Lisa,"as one of the simpson women, would you like to contribute something to it?"
44028,Lisa,"oh, i know."
52223,Lisa,you don't even care! you don't even care!
44035,Lisa,"come on, nelson! you must think and feel things. i mean, look where we are: a rolling green hillside, the stars coming out like god is lighting a million tiny candles, the moon looking down on us as if to say..."
52228,Lisa,welcome back. bart! i'm sorry we had such a terrible fight.
44037,Lisa,"listen, you thugs, stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry!"
52230,Lisa,"dear log, my brother is still missing, and maybe it's my fault because i failed to take his abuse with good humor. i miss him so much already, that i don't know..."
52232,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing up here? everybody's worried."
52234,Lisa,"bart, why did you burn my centerpiece?"
44044,Lisa,i thought you weren't there.
44046,Lisa,"there, you did it again!"
52239,Lisa,apology accepted.
52241,Lisa,"oh, bart, i hope you're not taking this seriously. even a five-year-old knows that this is as choreographed as any ballet."
52242,Lisa,aren't you forgetting something?
44051,Lisa,"let's just call it ""smell ya later."""
44053,Lisa,"well, i'm really not thinking about that now."
44054,Lisa,i suppose it could be almost anybody...
52245,Lisa,dad?
52247,Lisa,stop!
44063,Lisa,but i'm not fruit! i'm a kid!
44064,Lisa,you've got to start backwards! / orange to orange! ignore the reds! / alternate corners! /
52256,Lisa,and i'm going over to janey's again. we're going to be... um... making the most of our childhood years.
52257,Lisa,we will.
52258,Lisa,there's peas everywhere.
52262,Lisa,maybe there's something else to do on this planet.
52264,Lisa,okay. may we please be excused?
52265,Lisa,"excuse me, mr. hutz. are you a shyster?"
44077,Lisa,"dad, according to ""junior skeptic magazine"" the chances are a hundred seventy-five million-to-one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours."
44079,Lisa,"santa's little helper, it's your birthday? we've got to get you a present! yes we do! yes we do!"
52273,Lisa,"as usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point entirely. sushi is considered quite a delicacy."
44088,Lisa,yankees.
44092,Lisa,"hi, mom!"
44093,Lisa,mr. smithers! mr. smithers! i found another hurt shrew! i think this one has a twisted ankle!
44096,Lisa,"mom, dad and mr. burns could be trapped in there!"
52294,Lisa,how romantic.
44104,Lisa,we'll find a way. mom has made so many sacrifices for us -- it's time we gave up something for her. i'll stop buying malibu stacey clothing.
52297,Lisa,"so, it was love at first sight."
52304,Lisa,thou shalt not steal!
44116,Lisa,do we have to?
52311,Lisa,"so, even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family, that would be stealing?"
44123,Lisa,"we'll miss you, shary bobbins."
52315,Lisa,"thank you, reverend lovejoy."
52321,Lisa,"we're really proud of you, dad."
52323,Lisa,"poor brandy. aunt selma, do you think you'll ever get married?"
52326,Lisa,eating is worse than opening eyes.
52329,Lisa,is too.
44139,Lisa,"you should try out, dad. you have a funny voice."
52332,Lisa,a long-lost half-brother. how dickensian!
44142,Lisa,i guess...
44144,Lisa,"aw, mom, are you sure you want to sell a family heirloom to pay the gas bill? i mean, what would your grandma say?"
44150,Lisa,i never realized how many celebrities humiliated themselves right in our own backyard!
44156,Lisa,he thinks you're gay.
52352,Lisa,"i'll make it, mom. just tape my lunch box to my hand."
44163,Lisa,"bart, there must be millions of dollars there!"
44164,Lisa,run!
52356,Lisa,arithmetic.
44171,Lisa,"bob, look!"
44173,Lisa,"no, chief, bob's innocent! it's the truth!"
44174,Lisa,"i love everything about the world of babysitting: the responsibility, the obligation, the pressure..."
44175,Lisa,"that's a trust, janey. a sacred trust."
52365,Lisa,"eight. thanks, dad."
52372,Lisa,"i've suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog. but when i look into his vacant brown eyes, i just can't bear to let him go. i'm sure mom agrees with me."
44181,Lisa,don't worry. a moth is no more harmful than a ladybug.
44184,Lisa,"yes, he had a brother robot named rod, who was two space-years older than him."
44186,Lisa,now put your left leg into the left side of the pants -- and you're done.
52380,Lisa,yes!
52381,Lisa,that's gross.
52382,Lisa,"dad, it's just a dumb mud puddle."
52383,Lisa,discount lion safari!
44192,Lisa,"bart, i know you're not wild about having me for a babysitter, but i'm not some ogre. i think you will find me fair and fun."
44199,Lisa,"oh, look, bart, now you got maggie all upset!"
44200,Lisa,"bart, that's coffee ice cream! it has caffeine in it!"
44202,Lisa,"lots more coffee. are you getting ready for bed, bart?"
52394,Lisa,of course.
52395,Lisa,will you take us to mt. splashmore?
44205,Lisa,why do you have to make this so hard?
52396,Lisa,"thanks, dad."
44211,Lisa,i didn't see any u.f.o.!
44212,Lisa,"well, he's not here! nobody's here! and none of you should be here! you've all been tricked!"
52410,Lisa,i was just practicing.
44220,Lisa,oh my god!
52413,Lisa,lisa simpson.
52414,Lisa,"um, one: your belt buckle says ""state of texas"", but texas wasn't a state until 1845."
44223,Lisa,we have to get you to the emergency room!
44224,Lisa,stop it! stand still! maybe i can pop it back in.
52415,Lisa,two: the revolver wasn't invented until 1835.
52419,Lisa,"no! no! it wasn't me! i would never do anything like that. it was just one of those immature people who, instead of building themselves up --"
52424,Lisa,please don't make me do it.
52427,Lisa,"-- but when you really make him laugh, you can see these two teeth. i think they're called the eye teeth."
52429,Lisa,"no, mom. this is different. i mean, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better."
52432,Lisa,"yesterday, he read us ""charlotte's web"", and cried at the end, never trying to hide his tears."
44242,Lisa,oh god! where's bart?!
44243,Lisa,"oh, bart, i'm so sorry. this is all like a bad dream..."
52439,Lisa,"places where my intelligence will be an asset, not a liability?"
52448,Lisa,can i get my ears pierced?
52450,Lisa,can i paint my nails?
44259,Lisa,i didn't. i just wanted to leave.
52452,Lisa,can i have wine?
52459,Lisa,"look everybody, maggie got her first tooth!"
44268,Lisa,"in a truth-telling contest. right, bart?"
52462,Lisa,ba-art!
44278,Lisa,"oh, it's for my junior achievers club. we're trying to earn money by recycling."
44279,Lisa,"mom, mom, you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane!"
52470,Lisa,"hi zia, how did you do on your math test?"
52471,Lisa,wanna go to a concert tonight? sixty-eight percent of the original cher is playing.
52474,Lisa,"i am trying to deal with my disrespectful daughter, but you are too clueless to understand what that's like."
44283,Lisa,"yes. um, does your plant have a recycling program?"
52476,Lisa,"godspeed, bart. i'm gonna go apologize to mom!"
44286,Lisa,no! i don't agree!
52480,Lisa,"and i'm going to take a page out of your playbook, and let it slide!"
44290,Lisa,"dad, if you just drink one more, i'll have a full bag."
44294,Lisa,"my name is lisa, mr. burns. lisa simpson."
52487,Lisa,i was worried! i thought i would find...
52488,Lisa,what? no! it doesn't matter what i thought. i'm sorry i spied on you. but what i found is my daughter looks up to me!
52491,Lisa,what are you doing here?
44303,Lisa,you have to cut these six-pack holders up. otherwise fish get trapped in them.
52495,Lisa,i love how you're dropping all your definite articles.
52496,Lisa,"uh, what are you cooking?"
52497,Lisa,"yes, well, uh..."
44308,Lisa,i'd love to -- partner!
44309,Lisa,"i'm so proud of you, mr. burns! you're getting your fortune back and you're doing it without endangering the planet or cozying up to the aspen crowd."
52502,Lisa,like my marriage.
44314,Lisa,stop! don't recycle! it's murder! you're helping mr. burns!
44317,Lisa,"i don't want to talk to you, mr. burns."
52515,Lisa,"eh, why not?"
52516,Lisa,should i have married nelson? 'cause we still talk on the phone.
44328,Lisa,what's he saying?
52521,Lisa,"lisa simpson, the following people want to friend you."
44335,Lisa,ned! ned! mr. flanders!
52529,Lisa,are you sure?
52530,Lisa,"you know, i was thinking of taking a poetry class at the community college."
44355,Lisa,is there any answer i can give that won't result in more push-ups?
44356,Lisa,"hey, look, it's the school motto."
44366,Lisa,okay. i'm not gonna give up. solitude never hurt anyone. emily dickinson lived alone and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known! and went crazy as a loon.
44369,Lisa,don't do that. why should we both be outcasts?
44373,Lisa,"oh, it's too hard. my hand is slipping."
44375,Lisa,duh! a challenge i could do.
44377,Lisa,yes!
44395,Lisa,"hey, where's bart?"
44404,Lisa,ralph and i could do the report together.
44409,Lisa,"his name doesn't matter. ""a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."""
44419,Lisa,yeah. except you were supposed to be telling the story of how i got my saxophone!
44427,Lisa,you have thirteen pickled eggs in this jar! and one cockroach!
44435,Lisa,i'm happy for you.
44437,Lisa,yo! / yayyy! i do! / i do! / right here! / yay! / i do! / let's go!
44438,Lisa,"wow, look at all these gadgets! if i were a nerd, i'd be in heaven."
44440,Lisa,"mom, stop! according to this, it says bart mixed up his dna with a fly's. i think that's bart!"
44445,Lisa,"oh no! and i let him use my toothbrush! well, that hideous creep doesn't scare me."
44458,Lisa,all right. go ahead.
44468,Lisa,this bed is making me nauseous. why won't it stop?!
44471,Lisa,"mom, mom. i stepped in a bear trap."
44472,Lisa,"hey, tubby. want another pop-tart, tubby?"
44475,Lisa,you do?
44476,Lisa,well... football's not really my thing.
44478,Lisa,i've gotta go.
44485,Lisa,just tell them about yourself.
44486,Lisa,ohhhh. / hiiiii.
44494,Lisa,"dad, those peanuts aren't for you, they're for the elephant."
44512,Lisa,but it can't be an angel!
44513,Lisa,"well, maybe it's, uh, uh... a neanderthal, who got bitten by some angry fish."
44516,Lisa,"ahh, here's dr. gould now. what were the results, professor?"
44518,Lisa,what about that sign right there?
44523,Lisa,"oh, thank you so much! uhm... you know i can't afford to pay you."
44525,Lisa,inconclusive? then why did you come running up like that?
44537,Lisa,it's gone...
44538,Lisa,nothing. someone must have stolen it.
44544,Lisa,"you exploited people's deepest beliefs just to hawk your cheesy wares?! well, we are outraged! aren't we?!"
44546,Lisa,"well, it was just so loud and... heh, heh, heh... thanks for sqeezing back."
44548,Lisa,"oh, don't listen to my husband. he's just an idiot. now, i'm a veterinarian and i need to keep lots of sick animals in my house. is that permitted?"
44551,Lisa,yay!/ way to go!
44554,Lisa,wow! / your own billboard! / check it out!
44558,Lisa,this year's tree is just perfect. that old aluminum one was so fake.
44559,Lisa,"bart, did you hear that?"
44561,Lisa,"you didn't invent that, bart. the indians used to drink water to wake up early for their attacks."
44563,Lisa,"bart, what were you doing outside?"
44565,Lisa,nothing could be as fun as that looks.
44595,Lisa,no! then who'd chop off my hands?
44608,Lisa,and how. / heck yeah. / yes they are. / you betcha.
44615,Lisa,"no we don't, mother!"
44625,Lisa,the hell with him! / what leader? / he can take a flying leap as far as i'm concerned! / lea-who?
44627,Lisa,yayyy!
44628,Lisa,but we heard them hovering!
44642,Lisa,"not now, martin."
44645,Lisa,"your honor, the defense calls its first and only witness: milhouse van houten."
44649,Lisa,the defense has just one more question.
44651,Lisa,i rest my case.
44659,Lisa,"oh, figs."
44665,Lisa,oh rats! talk about bad luck! i forgot to wear socks today. guess i can't try those on.
44666,Lisa,ewww!
44684,Lisa,"hey, some of us are still trying to solve it!"
44687,Lisa,"i don't need a hint, ralph!"
44697,Lisa,"mom, i think something's wrong with me. i can't do anything right lately."
44698,Lisa,it can't just be a bad day. i feel like i'm getting dumber by the minute.
44699,Lisa,what are you talkin' about?
44702,Lisa,this is just two years ago!
44705,Lisa,"wait, that's not how you spell ""dumbening."" wait, ""dumbening"" isn't even a word!"
44707,Lisa,time is running out.
44708,Lisa,no.
44710,Lisa,"isn't there any way i can change my dna, like sitting on the microwave?"
44712,Lisa,"well, ralph seems happy enough... maybe i should just give up now and settle into a mindless, happy stupor..."
44725,Lisa,"oh, kenny, look at the interplay of light and shadow. it's so luminous and vibrant."
44731,Lisa,"uhh, you bet i am!"
44741,Lisa,"that means you went to college, right?"
44747,Lisa,what a whimsical building! who says science can't be fun?
44750,Lisa,let's just pray this hits the prison.
44752,Lisa,"but surely, i deserve some credit for..."
44754,Lisa,are you thinking of joining the naval reserve?
44755,Lisa,"eh, sort of."
44764,Lisa,the government has no right to use you this way.
44771,Lisa,"well, we used to date. plus, he threatened me."
44772,Lisa,"back off, bart. this may be the only chance i get as a second grader to produce my own tv show, and i'm not gonna let you screw it up."
44775,Lisa,"bart, get out of my anchor chair."
44777,Lisa,"thank you. our top story today: in a move that could affect children townwide, the library book-purchase committee slashed its budget by three percent. first on the chopping block, periodicals."
44785,Lisa,"look, i love bart... but he's never even read a newspaper."
44790,Lisa,that wasn't news. that was sappy manipulative drivel.
44792,Lisa,it's lisa.
44809,Lisa,"oh, no! what have i done?!"
44817,Lisa,"come on, mom, the stores just invented this holiday to make money."
44823,Lisa,"aren't you gonna buy it, dad?"
44825,Lisa,"'cause he's homer simpson, man"
44827,Lisa,drugs.
44832,Lisa,i've got some!
44836,Lisa,this exhibit is a once-in-a-lifetime event. it's the first time these egyptian artifacts have been allowed out of england.
44837,Lisa,"oh, i can't wait! in just twenty minutes, we'll be in a three hour line to see the orb of isis."
44839,Lisa,wait! you promised to take me to the museum!
44841,Lisa,but it's the last day of the isis exhibit!
44845,Lisa,"well... if it would put your mind at ease, i could take a limousine. although that would cost two hundred dollars..."
44847,Lisa,"oh, all right."
44852,Lisa,that's one small step f-- whoa!
44859,Lisa,"um... excuse me, sir. when does this bus get to the museum?"
44862,Lisa,but i'm lost and i need to know where --
44866,Lisa,hey!
44877,Lisa,"excuse me, ma'am? uh, hello? somebody? anybody?"
44886,Lisa,what?
44892,Lisa,okay... here goes.
44895,Lisa,have you ever seen such exquisite ushabtis?
44914,Lisa,"what are we looking for, anyway?"
44917,Lisa,do you know you have your hands in each other's pockets?
44919,Lisa,unbelievable.
44923,Lisa,"uh, i was just trying to find dave barry's column."
44937,Lisa,"uh, they were... all wiped out in the big trophy fire."
44938,Lisa,alex! over here! okay if the new girl sits with us?
44942,Lisa,"that's it, don't be shy..."
44944,Lisa,or a big joke.
44946,Lisa,where are they going?
44947,Lisa,"hey, wait up!"
44953,Lisa,"oh, earrings! wow, thank you so much, alex. but these are for pierced ears."
44963,Lisa,"aren't we a little young for makeup and... what do you mean, five pounds?"
44968,Lisa,eww!

44994,Lisa,huh?
44998,Lisa,"oh, act your age."
45000,Lisa,"come on, let's get you into your favorite shirt."
45013,Lisa,"somebody had to tell him, mom. in the long run, it's much kinder to--"
45022,Lisa,yes! a maggie-oop!
45032,Lisa,a horn?
45035,Lisa,bolivian tree lizard?
45038,Lisa,but aren't the snakes even worse?
45043,Lisa,"uh, bart?"
45046,Lisa,i told you capital punishment isn't a deterrent.
45052,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
45053,Lisa,hey... gim... ah... ah!
45059,Lisa,dad! push exit!
45060,Lisa,"oh, geez!"
45062,Lisa,poor maggie. if only you could tell us what's happening to you.
45064,Lisa,dad! wake up! wake up! wake up!
45065,Lisa,"yeah, yeah. anyway, you promised to take us to the lake."
45074,Lisa,"i didn't quite get the point of it, dad. why would lenny want someone to saw his legs off?"
45075,Lisa,"hey, dad, it says they need your full name. you only put down your middle initial."
45079,Lisa,and the soles of your feet are jet black.
45081,Lisa,candy warhol? xavier nougat?
45082,Lisa,lobsters need salt water.
45088,Lisa,i am so scared.
45099,Lisa,"no, no! yes! that's it! bite, bite, bite!"
45106,Lisa,"""mr. toad has a red blank."" okay, skip that one. ""mr. blank needs a blank in order to blank his blank."" i am in deep blank."
45107,Lisa,"no, not brown!"
45113,Lisa,"hey, i can't go in there!"
45115,Lisa,forget it. i'd rather get a zero.
45125,Lisa,what?
45126,Lisa,"stop it! i cheated! cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated!"
45140,Lisa,"but, mom--"
45141,Lisa,that's one grade i truly earned.
45144,Lisa,"hey, dad, that light says, ""check engine."""
45147,Lisa,"uh, should we help him?"
45156,Lisa,"oh, poor mark hamill."
45171,Lisa,whoa / curfew?
45173,Lisa,"what a beautiful night... fireflies, full moon..."
45181,Lisa,"/ ohh, yeahhhh."
45186,Lisa,"our top secret tonight: gay divorcée luann van houten has been cheating on her boyfriend pyro -- with his best friend, gyro."
45189,Lisa,"adults! / you're such a drooling snoring, boozing boring bunch / surly, meanie, three-martini lunch-ers."
45190,Lisa,i warned you guys that seniors always vote in record numbers.
45197,Lisa,"yeah, i'm bored too."
45199,Lisa,"oh, those poor, helpless cows."
45207,Lisa,these super bowl commercials are weird.
45208,Lisa,unplugged.
45209,Lisa,isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?
45210,Lisa,the renaissance.
45221,Lisa,"dad, you were supposed to pay for those snacks."
45225,Lisa,"hey, give me some of that."
45239,Lisa,"okay, dad, we're ready."
45241,Lisa,"why do you assume that i won't pick something fun? let's see... oh, this looks very educatio--"
45248,Lisa,"hey, how come the smithsonian needs to be sponsored by a cel phone company?"
45254,Lisa,"dad, don't do that!"
45261,Lisa,but where am i supposed to live?!
45264,Lisa,shut up.
45268,Lisa,ohhh! quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it!
45270,Lisa,no-ho-ho...
45273,Lisa,i just want to study.
45275,Lisa,that's awful!
45279,Lisa,sounds great.
45285,Lisa,i just wish you could keep an open mind about other cultures.
45287,Lisa,bleagghhh!
45295,Lisa,"boy, i can really be a pain in the butt."
45297,Lisa,"hi, dad. how was it?"
45299,Lisa,"not to me, dad."
45305,Lisa,we're buying a new doorbell?
45309,Lisa,"wait, people are coming. i think they're jehovah's witnesses."
45311,Lisa,"oh, that's it. i'm putting an end to this."
45314,Lisa,i thought you were just a marketing gimmick.
45315,Lisa,"we can't keep living like this. moses, ask pharaoh to let your people go."
45316,Lisa,"excuse me, uh, pharaoh? i think moses here has something to ask you. go."
45318,Lisa,"it's a plague, you moron! and we've got lots more planned, and there's nothing you can do about it!"
45324,Lisa,"all right, moses, lead your people."
45326,Lisa,"hmm, well, actually, it looks like we're in for forty years of wandering the desert."
45333,Lisa,"where are you going with that junk, dad?"
45336,Lisa,i'm sick of him already.
45337,Lisa,"well, dad, if the museum didn't inspire you, maybe you should do something really radical, like christo."
45349,Lisa,a banana!
45354,Lisa,here you go. make sure you get into every crevice.
45356,Lisa,"picture yourself on a beautiful sailboat. ahhh, can't you just feel the sea breeze in your hair?... or scalps?"
45359,Lisa,"oh no, bart has stolen the elderly!"
45360,Lisa,bart simpson!
45367,Lisa,why don't you finish your own darn...
45368,Lisa,"hey, mom, look!"
45378,Lisa,unbelievable! we're rewarding people for acting like buffoons!
45387,Lisa,"well, most of us."
45395,Lisa,"""we read your letter with great interest. if you wish to learn more, go to 13 euclid street. tell no one! and bring a dessert."""
45402,Lisa,"but ""rise to vote sir"" is a palindrome."
45403,Lisa,wow. me... fit in.
45405,Lisa,see dos. see dos run. run dos run. only one person in a million would find that funny.
45408,Lisa,this is so cool. i feel like i'm back in the renaissance.
45409,Lisa,someone should stand up to them.
45412,Lisa,done!
45413,Lisa,"well, there's no one more learned than us..."
45414,Lisa,"with our superior intellects, we could rebuild this city on a foundation of reason and enlightenment. we could turn springfield into a utopia!"
45415,Lisa,"no, kent. we're gonna use the power of good ideas to change things for the better..."
45417,Lisa,"okay, next item of business is our weekly progress report. principal skinner? how's your transportation project coming?"
45424,Lisa,even you?
45426,Lisa,"dad, it's not..."
45431,Lisa,"dad, that's fox!"
45439,Lisa,yay! the simpsons are going to japan!
45457,Lisa,"ah! dad, you're headed for the harbor!"
45458,Lisa,"bart, don't..."
45459,Lisa,"but, dad, i thought you hated..."
45467,Lisa,are you standing up to get me to leave?
45474,Lisa,aagghh!
45475,Lisa,"dad, that junkie is your son!"
45476,Lisa,it's good to have the old bart back. plus you exposed the disturbing unreadiness of today's army.
45483,Lisa,i'll help you write a new review if you just let me use the bathroom!
45489,Lisa,bon appetit.
45497,Lisa,i'm reviewing the festival for our school paper.
45502,Lisa,what bad things? why?
45505,Lisa,we've got to go to the police.
45506,Lisa,he's getting closer!
45516,Lisa,"wait a minute, xena can't fly."
45517,Lisa,oh.
45518,Lisa,"you did fix them, right dad? because even a single faulty unit could corrupt every other computer in the world."
45523,Lisa,they're evacuating the earth! we're saved!
45525,Lisa,"actually, he's homer simpson. that's bart. i'm lisa..."
45538,Lisa,no thanks. i'm still finishing my thistles.
45541,Lisa,maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.
45547,Lisa,just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
45565,Lisa,you keep it.
45567,Lisa,and why aren't i at school?
45570,Lisa,are you okay?
45571,Lisa,"well, we could play clam traffic jam... or the game of county seats!"
45572,Lisa,"aw, the zoning disk is warped..."
45573,Lisa,i'll be in my room.
45589,Lisa,get down. security guard.
45593,Lisa,"oh, brother."
45594,Lisa,"i admit it's kind of cute, but it'll never take the place of malibu stacy."
45597,Lisa,"exactly. come on, bart, we've got to warn everyone."
45599,Lisa,"well, i guess that's it. come christmas eve, there'll be a funzo under every tree."
45609,Lisa,your toy company is evil.
45611,Lisa,"no, bart, he's right. i did oversimplify."
45613,Lisa,gary...
45624,Lisa,"hey, mom!"
45633,Lisa,oh! you're gonna be late.
45634,Lisa,here are your lunches. and no trading your fruit for firecrackers.
45641,Lisa,"so, how was your day?"
45660,Lisa,let's see... crusty sores...
45663,Lisa,"okay, and... ""diagnose""."
45665,Lisa,"now guys, leprosy thrives in filthy conditions, so your only chance is to clean up the house. i'll get you a couple of mops."
45668,Lisa,he told us he'd been going to the gym.
45671,Lisa,"well, dad and bart ran away and no one seems to know where they went."
45677,Lisa,"bart, i hope you don't believe your own hype."
45685,Lisa,bart did it! and they're gonna try for a field goal.
45694,Lisa,it looks great. i can't believe we scrubbed that old man smell out of a hundred and thirty-seven rooms.
45695,Lisa,"ah, it's good to be home."
45697,Lisa,"well, i thought maybe, for once, we could play a song that wasn't written by sousa."
45701,Lisa,"""stars and stripes forever""? oh, man. they're toast!"
45709,Lisa,"hello, i'd like to speak to president clinton, please. i wrote to him and he never wrote back... no, i don't want al gore!"
45724,Lisa,"dad, there are other wipes besides star-wipes."
45747,Lisa,i don't know if i'll be able to accept moe as dr. tad winslow.
45748,Lisa,how much farther to the campground?
45761,Lisa,appointed a supreme court justice.
45767,Lisa,"bart, get out of here!"
45770,Lisa,"if i'm gonna bail the country out... i'll have to raise taxes. but in my speech, i'd like to avoid calling it a ""painful emergency tax."""
45775,Lisa,are you insane?
45777,Lisa,the months ahead will be long and arduous. but it is only through arduousity th...
45778,Lisa,"uh, this is my brother bart, who doesn't seem to realize this isn't the best time for his music. he's one of the people i want to help with my programs."
45786,Lisa,"no, just keep him out of my hair."
45788,Lisa,"bart, we're having a meeting."
45792,Lisa,absolutely. i want you and your pals to go away to camp david and write up a report on coolness.
45795,Lisa,"thanks bart, you bought us some time. what can i do to thank you?"
45798,Lisa,really? anything good?
45802,Lisa,it does?
45810,Lisa,"okay, that's it... looks good... oh, bart, the bulldog didn't ante!"
45819,Lisa,all right! / cool! / lemme see!
45821,Lisa,what? / how could you?
45822,Lisa,"dad, those are just the names of the quizzes. you're supposed to open the magazine."
45831,Lisa,"hey, where is dad?"
45832,Lisa,"not really, no."
45833,Lisa,ewww.
45835,Lisa,"too hot to bicker, i reckon."
45837,Lisa,what should i do?
45838,Lisa,run!
45841,Lisa,it got rave reviews from both the entertainment radio network and the radio entertainment network. let's go!
45854,Lisa,but i just... need more practice. see ya!
45859,Lisa,why isn't my name in the program?
45864,Lisa,"most entertaining, but how does that help me?"
45865,Lisa,"ohhhhhh. that's brilliant, professor! what will you think of next?"
45866,Lisa,i've gotta go now.
45868,Lisa,"but, but you don't understand..."
45870,Lisa,i can't help it! it's the shoes!
45874,Lisa,"i'm sorry, vicki. i just wanted to be a dancer so badly."
45879,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
45895,Lisa,"and i'm directing the ""making of"" video."
45896,Lisa,"i had no business hosting the oscars. after the show, meryl streep spit on me."
45898,Lisa,"dad, that's too much deterge--"
45906,Lisa,"dad, i want to go to bed. aren't there child labor laws?"
45909,Lisa,swings!
45919,Lisa,but these fairy tales take me away from the harsh reality of peasant life.
45925,Lisa,we're in the three bears house!
45930,Lisa,you know she's only fattening you up so she can eat you.
45938,Lisa,"hey, where are you going?"
45944,Lisa,"i kinda wish i hadn't freed their leader and, you know... doomed mankind."
45953,Lisa,... it's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code. it would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight.
45957,Lisa,"dad, the arena's in olde springfield."
45960,Lisa,you've ruined all my stuff.
45965,Lisa,"catch, dad, catch!"
45971,Lisa,"bart, do you know how many trees died to make those menus?"
45979,Lisa,no i don't!
45984,Lisa,you do yoga?
45992,Lisa,"mom, dad, there's something i have to do. you're not gonna like it, but i really believe it's the right thing."
46000,Lisa,he said i was hard core.
46005,Lisa,awww.
46008,Lisa,and coloring easter eggs!
46019,Lisa,"dad, i'm not dead!"
46027,Lisa,"aw, jesse. they locked you up again."
46031,Lisa,you gave bart one.
46038,Lisa,"oh dad, you have to stop."
46041,Lisa,"dad, how can you put a price on your dignity?"
46042,Lisa,da-ad!
46043,Lisa,"forget about him, dad. i'm proud of you."
46047,Lisa,something tells me he is.
46050,Lisa,"dad! but if you're here, who's that on the float?"
46051,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't drag that around."
46062,Lisa,can i turn this off?
46067,Lisa,what happened to mom?
46077,Lisa,we did.
46078,Lisa,"nice work, everybody!"
46096,Lisa,"dad, did you read all these books today?"
46101,Lisa,"oh, many things: tai chi, chai tea... but i find, when i can't keep the unhappy thoughts from swirling in my brain, the best thing is usually a nice long walk."
46113,Lisa,that scary guy?
46120,Lisa,"ooh, it says here that special effects whiz tom savini is gonna be appearing at the comic book store tonight!"
46122,Lisa,the store is so busy. you and bart are really great businessmen.
46124,Lisa,practicing tennis.
46125,Lisa,especially bonnets.
46129,Lisa,"i'm just saying you feel threatened by bart, but it's all in your head."
46131,Lisa,this session's over.
46133,Lisa,are you sure you want me to be your doubles partner?
46139,Lisa,venus simpson? you're replacing me?
46141,Lisa,"the answer is ""bonbon""!"
46145,Lisa,that's not grampa. dad's just dehydrated.
46146,Lisa,"wait, what was that?"
46147,Lisa,"mommm, can't bart get his massage somewhere else?"
46149,Lisa,there's something weird about this video...
46150,Lisa,"no, something else..."
46162,Lisa,super-liminal?
46166,Lisa,m-e-h. meh.
46169,Lisa,ow! ow!
46173,Lisa,great!
46174,Lisa,"thanks again, dad."
46177,Lisa,there's all kinds of ways to get the public on your side. bob dylan wrote songs. cesar chavez staged hunger strikes.
46179,Lisa,why don't you just cook less?
46181,Lisa,"but mom, the school's right here."
46183,Lisa,give her a break. remember your first day at school?
46184,Lisa,"well, someone's gotta make her feel welcome."
46196,Lisa,well i'm gonna need full coverage -- my bully is highly aggressive. check out these indian burns.
46198,Lisa,wow. there's so much i don't understand about bullying.
46209,Lisa,hmm...
46210,Lisa,of course! the nose clip!
46215,Lisa,"excellent, now don't mind the squeegee."
46216,Lisa,"mr. tatum, do you mind if i swab you with this damp rag?"
46219,Lisa,yes!
46225,Lisa,no. the reason is chemical.
46226,Lisa,"please, dr. koop. let me demonstrate."
46231,Lisa,"actually, it's just ordinary salad dressing."
46235,Lisa,the repellent's all gone!
46237,Lisa,we need these because we have... to...
46250,Lisa,"oh, now come on..."
46254,Lisa,look what mbali gave me.
46255,Lisa,no they don't. they--
46260,Lisa,this is the place i've read about! where dr. bushwell lives among the chimps!
46261,Lisa,"no, dr. bushwell is a woman."
46262,Lisa,"your work has really inspired me, doctor. and i love your sensible ponytail."
46274,Lisa,"meet linguo, the grammar robot. i built him all by myself. if you misuse language, he'll correct you."
46275,Lisa,"dad, no!"
46278,Lisa,"dad, no!"
46281,Lisa,"quiet, please! some of us are trying to weld! almost done. just lay still."
46286,Lisa,"hey, stop! wait! oh, any day but science project day!"
46293,Lisa,i'm at the wrong school!
46304,Lisa,"chief wiggum, can you drive me to school? it's an emergency."
46306,Lisa,mom? where'd you get that car?
46309,Lisa,"mom, i have to get to school. it's ten to three!"
46317,Lisa,"are you blushing, mr. flanders?"
46320,Lisa,"we're the neighbors, and we don't think."
46326,Lisa,how about asking the community for donations?
46327,Lisa,he's speaking in tongues!
46330,Lisa,so many times we've seen our father go under the knife.
46338,Lisa,night will come soon.
46340,Lisa,back to normal.
46343,Lisa,i wanna see wilmington!
46344,Lisa,excuse me...
46346,Lisa,i'm just sayin'...
46348,Lisa,"uhhh, could we hear another tall tale?"
46353,Lisa,maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.
46363,Lisa,abraca-dairy!
46366,Lisa,"bart, you're getting vomit on my prince. head zeppelin!"
46370,Lisa,"the dark lord montymort, absorber of souls, sucker of essence!"
46376,Lisa,ack!
46383,Lisa,you're not even listening!
46384,Lisa,that's my brother.
46397,Lisa,but you're not even using them.
46407,Lisa,"i did. you owe rem an apology for, eco-fraud."
46411,Lisa,then i'll have the sweet 'n' sour rice.
46416,Lisa,that means dad's not a kidnapper. he's a hostage.
46418,Lisa,"well, the important thing is, they're both safe."
46419,Lisa,i think it can.
46428,Lisa,try to remember back when you were twelve. something frightening must have happened.
46444,Lisa,i feel like i want to throw up.
46445,Lisa,why does jesus have a lasso?
46457,Lisa,i can't believe you're eavesdropping on my prayers!
46459,Lisa,yep.
46466,Lisa,richard gere?
46471,Lisa,"hey, i'm a buddhist!"
46483,Lisa,my family tried to trick me into celebrating christmas!
46488,Lisa,now i really should be getting back to my family.
46491,Lisa,uh huh.
46495,Lisa,"we've got star wars monopoly, rasta-mon-opoly, galip-olopoly... edna krabappoly..."
46497,Lisa,"hey, where'd they go?"
46501,Lisa,"mom, that's not how you pry them apart."
46502,Lisa,and we carried it out as a family!
46503,Lisa,"thanks a lot, everybody. now i'll never get into an ivy league school."
46505,Lisa,"well, my room is my sanctuary. my family knows that and respects that."
46512,Lisa,"now, bart!"
46513,Lisa,could this be the end of our series... of events?
46515,Lisa,i'm eight years old.
46516,Lisa,we had a good run.
46526,Lisa,"we have to sign up plaintiffs, and take depositions from the townspeople."
46528,Lisa,godspeed.
46539,Lisa,"thanks for listening, dad."
46540,Lisa,we gotta coordinate on this thing.
46550,Lisa,he must have taken a job in the west springfield oil patch. that's practically a death sentence!
46558,Lisa,i will not be a gamecock!
46562,Lisa,greta called. it seems you told her you were sick.
46564,Lisa,"well, if you don't feel the way greta does, you've got to tell her before she gets hurt."
46566,Lisa,and where were you?
46568,Lisa,"all right. look, maggie's not playing with this ball right now. but look what happens when i take it."
46569,Lisa,see?
46572,Lisa,you know that new baby brother ralph's been bragging about? it's just a pinecone.
46581,Lisa,we also represent billy joel.
46583,Lisa,no one expects you to do anything difficult. they understand you're too old.
46586,Lisa,"dad, i'm on the line."
46590,Lisa,this game makes no sense.
46592,Lisa,"see you later, i'm going to the library."
46602,Lisa,"here's the book... ""classics for children?"""
46605,Lisa,"what are you laughing at, dad?"
46612,Lisa,"yes, sir."
46614,Lisa,"with modern ideas -- like putting bigger, harder people in the catapults. or how 'bout rocks?"
46615,Lisa,and now... attack!
46619,Lisa,let us kill the english! their concept of individual rights could undermine the power of our beloved tyrants!
46636,Lisa,"well, then they started pressuring me for more donations. and you can't hang up on a nun."
46639,Lisa,a hundred and fifty-six million.
46642,Lisa,"okay, here's some travel tips: only drink bottled water... don't get into an unlicensed taxi... and remember, they have winter during our summer."
46643,Lisa,that's right.
46644,Lisa,mm-hmm.
46648,Lisa,hey! hey!
46657,Lisa,you know i'm a vegetarian.
46666,Lisa,"dad, you just said that three minutes ago."
46667,Lisa,"it's time for your surprise, dad."
46670,Lisa,"that's true, bart. our father knows the best way to embarrass his kids."
46674,Lisa,"it worked, mom! maggie's memories have shown them humanity's inner goodness."
46677,Lisa,"groundskeeper willie, groundskeeper willie's enemy seamus..."
46681,Lisa,"bart, this is just dad!"
46682,Lisa,"no, it's just dad."
46688,Lisa,"dad, i'm no fan of bart's cartoon, but you have a real problem with anger."
46690,Lisa,no. the last step is quitting.
46696,Lisa,bravo!
46699,Lisa,who wants to put on a leotard and get screamed at?
46705,Lisa,ich bin ein... gymnast!
46706,Lisa,"oh, thank you!"
46709,Lisa,you guys are so cool. i can't believe i never met you before.
46714,Lisa,um... i'm a teacher's aide in a very special class.
46717,Lisa,"actually, i'm off campus. i, um, share a house with a couple of girls, a couple of guys."
46728,Lisa,where is everybody?
46739,Lisa,what are you doing?
46744,Lisa,really? that's wonderful. but how?
46751,Lisa,but i like my old name.
46762,Lisa,"oh yeah, that's the pride."
46768,Lisa,"goldie, you were more than just a goldfish -- you were a member of the family."
46774,Lisa,"if not for guns, poor william bonney might have become a doctor, or a senator..."
46776,Lisa,"...twenty eight, twenty nine... there's one missing."
46779,Lisa,hip hip...
46794,Lisa,that is so sweet.
46796,Lisa,please don't say any more!
46799,Lisa,come... on... dad...
46806,Lisa,it's wednesday night!
46809,Lisa,what? i've gotta be in the same class as him?
46810,Lisa,"okay, the sun rises in the east, so the rooster would probably want to lay it on the cool side..."
46812,Lisa,"stop, i want to learn on my own!"
46817,Lisa,that's cheating! bart cheated!
46820,Lisa,he started it! he did punch buggy first!
46821,Lisa,big fish! big fish!
46827,Lisa,i spearheaded this one.
46831,Lisa,"they left without you too, you idiot."
46836,Lisa,hey!
46840,Lisa,"bart, you're my big brother. you should act like it more often. you know, protect me from the bad things in the world."
46849,Lisa,"i win, dad. that means i get to choose today's father-daughter activity!"
46850,Lisa,we're building homes for the homeless.
46854,Lisa,"dad, you're getting paint on your wedding ring."
46859,Lisa,"mom, doesn't it bother you that they're giving you all this attention just because of those?"
46869,Lisa,hey kozlov! aim for the five hole! he's got an opening the size of red square.
46872,Lisa,i think we might have termites.
46878,Lisa,"with all this hard work, i'm too tired to worry about the world. and soon i will marry one of father's wealthy business associates!"
46887,Lisa,dad's heading straight for the museum of swordfish!
46893,Lisa,"hey bart, you could nominate mrs. krabappel for an actual award, the teacher of the year. then she'll feel appreciated."
46896,Lisa,what happened to you two?
46897,Lisa,"mom, is that principal skinner sleeping in the bed of tomorrow?"
46902,Lisa,"mom, dad, my birthday's coming up, and girltech turbo diaries are in stores now."
46916,Lisa,"well, maybe."
46929,Lisa,what? why?
46932,Lisa,let's just get some sleep.
46933,Lisa,i don't wanna eat from the trash.
46938,Lisa,"don't try to pin this on me, sister."
46939,Lisa,"mom, you didn't get the milk."
46943,Lisa,"uh, guys? mom just left the basement!"
46945,Lisa,"stop it, please! i'm trying to eat."
46965,Lisa,bart sad.
46967,Lisa,"this isn't ""bart sad."" it's ""bart's ad."""
46971,Lisa,"bart, where are you gonna live?"
46977,Lisa,"wow, this place is great. that couch looks really pricey."
46980,Lisa,shhh.
46991,Lisa,a-m-e-l-i-o-r-a-t-e. ameliorate.
46998,Lisa,r-e-l-a-p-s-e.
47004,Lisa,"dad, this is my moment in the sun. how can you miss it to be with a sandwich?"
47010,Lisa,i'm not throwing a spelling bee! i'll die before i misspell.
47013,Lisa,"no, i don't want to pay for college by throwing a spelling bee."
47016,Lisa,"well, i suppose i could just skip college and marry milhouse..."
47020,Lisa,"with you here i can't fail. attention, everyone. i was asked to take a dive. but i won't do it. i-n-t-r-a-n-s-i-g-a-n-c-e."
47027,Lisa,"come on, come on, let's get to the beach!"
47030,Lisa,now she's dating mr. flanders. that's so romantic!
47035,Lisa,this is not a delta hub!
47042,Lisa,congressman.
47047,Lisa,"oh, that's easy. first it's introduced, then it goes to committee, then..."
47052,Lisa,me too. the walls are paper-thin.
47053,Lisa,hi.
47063,Lisa,i gotta pick a career! gotta pick a career!
47067,Lisa,"formed by unimaginable heat and pressure deep inside the earth, minerals explode in a vast panoply of... eh."
47068,Lisa,"that's it! lisa simpson, astronomer!"
47071,Lisa,"dad, that's a kaleidoscope."
47072,Lisa,what happened?
47076,Lisa,we've got to do something. i know --maybe we can get people to sign a petition.
47082,Lisa,"oh, stop."
47086,Lisa,nooo!
47088,Lisa,"bart, i just realized -- we both want the same thing: darkness. and we can get it if we work together, with my brain and your... your... assistance."
47089,Lisa,"you can't have lights without power, and all the power comes from here."
47091,Lisa,"now we merely push this switch to ""overload."" yet once we do, we'll be breaking the law. can good truly come from civil disobedience? gandhi thought so..."
47093,Lisa,look!
47095,Lisa,i wonder what mom came up with for this week's 'family wednesday.'
47098,Lisa,ages eight to eighty.
47099,Lisa,does anyone have any swan heads? i've got nothing but necks.
47102,Lisa,this awful. it's like listening to schubert's unfinished symphony!
47103,Lisa,"dad, where are you going?"
47109,Lisa,dad!
47110,Lisa,"thanks, julio. i love you as a blonde."
47113,Lisa,...walking in a winter wonderland.
47132,Lisa,"i can't believe luke has another gal. ""my name is clara... i've known luke for more than five days..."""
47134,Lisa,...but a quicker way to the ranch is that shortcut.
47142,Lisa,i'm sorry. i only sent you the wrong way because i thought you were luke's girlfriend.
47143,Lisa,did clara... tell you anything else?
47153,Lisa,you said his name two seconds ago.
47158,Lisa,why does a dog have human girlfriends?
47169,Lisa,"uh-oh, dad. i think he peed on the rug."
47171,Lisa,where do you keep the fish 'til it's done?
47172,Lisa,"dad, mom's been driving everyone everywhere. why don't you take public transportation?"
47175,Lisa,amble!
47176,Lisa,amble!
47183,Lisa,who'd want candy filled with laxatives?
47188,Lisa,the flower's starting to open!
47189,Lisa,"dad, the traffic's moving."
47199,Lisa,"""my dad's job."" my dad's job takes him to all parts of the community. he performs a valuable service, but is often misunderstood, like a vulture or the flesh-eating maggot."
47228,Lisa,"hey, as long as we're thinking about her, grandma's still alive."
47229,Lisa,"and the winner is, seventeen!"
47237,Lisa,"no, i'm gonna stick to my platform of incremental policy amelioration: fluoridated water fountains, vegan lunch options..."
47240,Lisa,"i'm not that cool, i don't wear jeans / i've polished an apple or two / but every grade that i grubbed, i grubbed it for you... / so call me bookworm / but i'll never squirm, when there's work to be done / yes i'll take my lunch at my desk / while you're all outside having fun..."
47256,Lisa,"well, i am proud of my light."
47258,Lisa,excuse me? i was wondering if i should read what i just signed.
47263,Lisa,"well, i think i can say with all humility, i am gonna be the best school president ever."
47274,Lisa,meh.
47288,Lisa,"bart, that exhibit over there is biased, insensitive and anti-feminist."
47290,Lisa,"bart, i don't care what mom said. i think you should use this money to take her on a nice vacation."
47296,Lisa,can you tell me what happens at the end of the series?
47297,Lisa,yes.
47298,Lisa,sir ian mckellen! you're my favorite shakespearean actor!
47305,Lisa,put out the fire first.
47309,Lisa,elatiors.
47311,Lisa,flowers.
47315,Lisa,"aunts patty and selma, can you help us pick out a mother's day gift?"
47316,Lisa,endorsed by the american carny association.
47318,Lisa,"i don't care if they think you're a coward, dad. you did the right thing, hiding and crying."
47321,Lisa,and bart's missing too!
47324,Lisa,"i just wanted to see what it was like. howdy, y'all. if you don't like mah song, i'll spray ya with ink!"
47326,Lisa,"i don't know, but whoever's in there is taking their sweet old time."
47333,Lisa,"krusty, what's wrong?"
47334,Lisa,"bart, the bar mitzvah is the most important event in a jewish boy's life. it's when he reads from the torah and becomes a man."
47337,Lisa,there's nothing in the talmud that forbids it.
47342,Lisa,"no, dad. i mean you should use your time on the air to say things that really mean something. change the world for the better!"
47345,Lisa,"cool, a toy store!"
47346,Lisa,"dad, i don't like the looks of this neighborhood."
47350,Lisa,"dad, what you saw was ""a christmas carol."" it was written by charles dickens a hundred and sixty years ago."
47351,Lisa,"dad, you don't have to out-do mr. flanders. just remember the spirit of the season."
47352,Lisa,"actually, most people now feel christmas has gotten too materialistic. in fact, as a buddhist, i believe people would be a lot happier without presents."
47359,Lisa,her eyes aren't focused.
47362,Lisa,"okay, but how?"
47367,Lisa,"for all their disposable income, for all their leisure time, they had no immunity against god's lowliest creatures: children."
47370,Lisa,that book doesn't know how i feel.
47374,Lisa,"well, i think it's only fair i get to name him. you got to name me."
47378,Lisa,"mom, i'm not sure god responds to threats and intimidation."
47380,Lisa,i guess i'm not meant to own a cat. i'm much happier petting this leaf.
47385,Lisa,"i guess you're right, principal tamzarian."
47392,Lisa,hm...
47393,Lisa,"i'm proud of you, mom. but just one thing: isn't your book a little hard on dad?"
47397,Lisa,what if they make it into a movie?
47399,Lisa,"dad's gonna catch flanders, just like the end of mom's book."
47404,Lisa,i can't.
47408,Lisa,okay.
47414,Lisa,fine. you can confirm the accuracy of the hose.
47416,Lisa,"bart, you're in my family."
47424,Lisa,"hey, we shouldn't tell anyone we were here. this place should be our special secret!"
47430,Lisa,who?
47433,Lisa,you told him our secret?!
47441,Lisa,but it's not my turn.
47453,Lisa,did you do that?
47456,Lisa,"oh my god, you're not just smart... you're brilliant! mom!"
47458,Lisa,"go on, maggie, you can do it."
47461,Lisa,really?
47464,Lisa,"all right, if i'm second rate as the smart kid, i'll find a new raison d'être."
47467,Lisa,how 'bout these entrées? stuffed cabbage? can you believe they found a way to make cabbage worse?
47480,Lisa,no. that's wrong.
47482,Lisa,i used to be the smart one.
47491,Lisa,"c'mon, c'mon..."
47498,Lisa,i don't remember doing that. i would never cheat!
47500,Lisa,"i don't care what they say, maggie. to me you're brilliant."
47501,Lisa,not for babies.
47506,Lisa,"it was only a movie, filmed in vancouver, with donald sutherland as the priest who stopped believing..."
47513,Lisa,copyright pink pony productions. visit us on the web at lisathemovie.com.
47517,Lisa,"thanks for reading me ""the corrections."" it makes me feel better about my own family."
47525,Lisa,"i can't believe the ""gathering shadow"" was senate redistricting!"
47526,Lisa,i'll write the letter.
47538,Lisa,did you guys get home at two last night?
47545,Lisa,"taco, please."
47553,Lisa,why are we even going? last year uncle tyrone was bitter and depressed.
47556,Lisa,"that's kaballah, jerk!"
47562,Lisa,so... how's the weather in dayton?
47575,Lisa,when you grow up i'll be outside.
47576,Lisa,"no! you don't understand. we came here to give you some privacy, and--"
47577,Lisa,let me finish my sentence!
47581,Lisa,what's wrong with it?
47583,Lisa,thank you mysterious stranger... where did he go?
47585,Lisa,"""richie rich incorporates in delaware,"" ""easy to believe tales,"" ""supergirl vs. the glass ceiling,"" ""the green listener""..."
47590,Lisa,you're not mild-mannered. you're often liquored-up and rude.
47601,Lisa,the perfect kiss!
47602,Lisa,"that's horrible. how could you, dad?"
47613,Lisa,we've become pariahs! in the last two hours i've gotten one thousand hate spams.
47614,Lisa,"we get it, mom."
47616,Lisa,i'd like to say something about the current climate of repression and fear.
47622,Lisa,o beautiful / for spacious skies / for amber waves of grain...
47623,Lisa,"my card here says ""aclu"" / now look what i'm going to do..."
47625,Lisa,swim toward san francisco!
47631,Lisa,"""postcard image, thing to see--"""
47641,Lisa,"hmm, how about feature columnist?"
47653,Lisa,you can't leave now! we're the only thing stopping mr. burns!
47660,Lisa,"stupid burns, cuts off my power, lowers my credit rating..."
47664,Lisa,"well, at least there's nothing else burns can do to me."
47667,Lisa,"oh, dad..."
47674,Lisa,hmmm.
47676,Lisa,"dad, you should listen to him. he's a man of science and you can barely read!"
47693,Lisa,"congratulations, mom. you seem to have a prescription for success."
47694,Lisa,don't forget your secret ingredient...
47705,Lisa,"dad, the kids at school said my butt's big."
47715,Lisa,that doesn't make any sense!
47716,Lisa,i know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy and anti-feminist... but that's what a fat girl would say!
47720,Lisa,"okay, if i stop here, i still have some dignity."
47725,Lisa,"nothing. like many women, i still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight."
47738,Lisa,chloe is amazing -- even her serving bowl smells glamorous.
47754,Lisa,i'm not a journalist.
47755,Lisa,"i'm sure you did. but still, don't you ever wonder what might have happened if things had gone differently?"
47760,Lisa,"mom, your hair."
47762,Lisa,miss lucy had a steamboat / the steamboat had a bell...
47764,Lisa,... hell-o operator...
47766,Lisa,...hind the 'fridgerator...
47768,Lisa,...ask me no more questions / i'll tell you no more--
47773,Lisa,"you're in big trouble, mister. i'm bleeding!"
47775,Lisa,"bart, if you don't get up now, good luck getting a pancake. dad's pulled his chair right up to the stove."
47778,Lisa,i bet you could find a distributor at the springfield novelty expo.
47787,Lisa,"dad, what did you do?"
47797,Lisa,drugs aren't so expensive in other countries.
47800,Lisa,a-lo-ha!
47801,Lisa,"we just wanted to thank you. because of the xanax, i'm not over-anxious about being a simpson anymore. i am a little anxious about being on xanax, but the zoloft covers that nicely."
47819,Lisa,"rappers stopped saying ""illin'"" twelve years ago."
47828,Lisa,wait just a minute.
47829,Lisa,"the way i was raised, by mom, i learned the truth can't be swept under the rug."
47832,Lisa,i have a real suggestion.
47838,Lisa,"aunt patty, where did you two meet? alternative book store? ethiopian restaurant?"
47849,Lisa,"people, please! i'm talking about toxic vapors."
47850,Lisa,baaart!
47858,Lisa,"i like eating here with you, dad. especially without ""don't have a cow, man."""
47864,Lisa,"okay, that's two... ...and that's it. if i think of another one, i'll let him back in."
47867,Lisa,"bart, don't worry."
47872,Lisa,"bart, you were gonna burn the third nice thing you've ever done for me?"
47876,Lisa,"don't give up, aunt selma. china has thousands of baby girls who need adoption."
47877,Lisa,the great wall of china was begun nearly two thousand years ago in order to repel barbarian invaders.
47880,Lisa,"listen, i've got a plan to get ling back. but we must be discreet. you never know where there might be a spy."
47882,Lisa,"yeah, dad. if you don't look perfect, you'll never be able to sneak in and steal ling back."
47910,Lisa,"okay, she's fat."
47911,Lisa,can't breathe... someone dangle some string!
47912,Lisa,we're not overfeeding her. we've been giving her this low-fat cat food!
47914,Lisa,"one thing at a time, bart."
47921,Lisa,what is bart still doing in there?
47927,Lisa,don't you mean astronomy?
47929,Lisa,"bart, maybe you should listen to this."
47931,Lisa,"well bart, i really appreciate what you're gonna do for me."
47935,Lisa,"also, gerontological studies have demonstrated that animal companions can slow the inevitable decline of--"
47937,Lisa,right after pat sajak.
47940,Lisa,that seems... feasible.
47944,Lisa,"""hydrogenated petroleum oil, monosodium poisonate, partially de-weaponized plutonium?!"""
47947,Lisa,i think he's having a heart attack!
47949,Lisa,i'd better tell dad.
47952,Lisa,maybe we could shop somewhere else. there's a farm stand next door.
47959,Lisa,looks like you guys are on the mend.
47960,Lisa,"thanks, bart. that's really sweet."
47961,Lisa,ow!
47962,Lisa,i hope we didn't camp out here for nothing. it's like every kid in springfield showed up.
47965,Lisa,"and remember, save the violence for cartoons!"
47976,Lisa,"i really do like working with you, dad. will you keep helping me?"
47981,Lisa,"no, it's fine."
47982,Lisa,"that's cameron. girls go crazy over him. he's cute, unthreatening, and his smile brought a puppy back to life."
47988,Lisa,dad... you're fired.
47990,Lisa,no one asked you to yell and slash!
47992,Lisa,dad looks so happy.
47994,Lisa,"hi! this lighting's a little bright. and um, could i get a red wash in the background?"
48006,Lisa,"mom, bart and i have been talking..."
48014,Lisa,"no, ma'am."
48033,Lisa,noble idiot! bring in the pie!
48052,Lisa,"dad, i don't think we're gonna find mom today. and i'm sick of eating at restaurant chains i've never even heard of, like skobo's and dim willie's."
48053,Lisa,ew.
48059,Lisa,there's no such thing as zombies!
48061,Lisa,"bart, don't you have homework to do?"
48067,Lisa,the land of the wild beasts? that's the first book i read all the way through.
48068,Lisa,groundskeeper willie?
48069,Lisa,i thought those people were your friends.
48075,Lisa,what about bart's bedroom?
48076,Lisa,yeah.
48090,Lisa,"you know, you monsters seem scary, but when you get a little closer you're just funny."
48096,Lisa,i think i'm gonna be fine. let's get some breakfast.
48100,Lisa,"dad, i thought mom kicked you out of the house."
48101,Lisa,"okay look, you and mom can fix this. what exactly happened between the two of you?"
48115,Lisa,"please don't accept this invitation, dad. hunting is cruel."
48116,Lisa,"mom, mr. burns is gonna kill dad!"
48124,Lisa,"dad, there's no such thing as ""father's day eve."""
48126,Lisa,"sure, why not."
48128,Lisa,"you know, this mass-produced junk doesn't express how i feel about dad. i am making him a present that comes from the heart."
48132,Lisa,"you didn't like it, did you?"
48133,Lisa,"oh dad, how could you?"
48138,Lisa,just take my whole backpack!
48142,Lisa,janey's father just takes her to the zoo once a month. couldn't you be that kind of dad?
48147,Lisa,"dad, we've got to do something."
48148,Lisa,lincoln was only one man.
48154,Lisa,"nelson, those don't count as easter eggs!"
48158,Lisa,of course i do. why would i say it if i didn't?
48164,Lisa,"oh sure, i get it. bart told you i was taking lessons, so you thought you'd come over and--"
48165,Lisa,you really speak italian?!
48167,Lisa,"buon giórno, milhouse."
48180,Lisa,"dad, don't you want to turn around and see the tower?"
48181,Lisa,"when mount vesuvius erupted, people were overcome by volcanic ash so fast that they were frozen in whatever position they were in at the moment of their death."
48182,Lisa,that's a dvd of a fellini movie!
48184,Lisa,maybe there's a mechanic in this tuscan village.
48189,Lisa,"dad, don't act like mussolini!"
48195,Lisa,i feel so sick.
48199,Lisa,sideshow bob has sworn a vendetta against us.
48217,Lisa,"no, but he told us to say hi. hi!"
48220,Lisa,they had to feed you through a tube.
48222,Lisa,i already made up a yard-sale sign!
48227,Lisa,my saxophone!
48228,Lisa,you're a jerk! i'm telling mom!
48235,Lisa,"i think you'll find that deep down, anyone can be civilized. goodnight, willie."
48237,Lisa,okay. how do you address an archbishop?
48241,Lisa,i think he's got it! oh yes he's got it!
48243,Lisa,and where should it not go?
48253,Lisa,"so, how you doin', willie?"
48259,Lisa,this chamber's not on the map! we could be stuck in here forever if we don't find a way out!
48262,Lisa,"oh. all right, um, i'll tell you something that happened to me last week. i was walking home from school..."
48268,Lisa,c'mon!
48275,Lisa,"so, to contin-"
48278,Lisa,how did you find this?
48286,Lisa,uh... sure.
48287,Lisa,this is much sadder than i expected.
48293,Lisa,he also happens to be toot-toot's son.
48294,Lisa,"nelson, funny town doesn't exist."
48301,Lisa,"i don't understand, dad. our family has so many flaws. why must we share them with the world?"
48307,Lisa,"yeah, the only thing we're known for is leading the country in heart attacks."
48318,Lisa,"de nada, grampa."
48322,Lisa,"mom, i'm scared."
48323,Lisa,oh yeah? what's mom's birthday?
48324,Lisa,what secrets?
48328,Lisa,"not prostitutes, protestants."
48329,Lisa,the year was sixteen twenty...
48330,Lisa,"mother, we must protect him. look, he's praying."
48333,Lisa,seventy-four.
48337,Lisa,we're the band. and we're on!
48342,Lisa,i can't wait to see this re-imagining of itchy and scratchy... by avant-garde director juliana krellner!
48345,Lisa,"it's so beautiful. ooh, paintings by female artists! frida kahlo, georgia o'keefe..."
48346,Lisa,cathy guisewite!
48351,Lisa,a mental challenge.
48354,Lisa,"assistant groundskeeper skinner, don't you think it's wrong that i can't get the best math education because i'm a girl?"
48365,Lisa,"that's easy -- just one, the number five."
48374,Lisa,"not yet. if i do, she'll never let me go to the boys' math class again."
48375,Lisa,you'd do that for me? that is so sweet.
48380,Lisa,"uh, give me your lunch money."
48384,Lisa,peew! peew!
48392,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
48398,Lisa,"dad, we don't want you to leave!"
48401,Lisa,"bart, it's still history."
48403,Lisa,how can you teach the book of genesis as a scientific theory?
48408,Lisa,but they're incompatible!
48411,Lisa,i have an issue i'd like to raise!
48417,Lisa,"i'm sorry, mom. i should have just gone with the flow like you said."
48420,Lisa,"i want you to know, i respect your beliefs and i can see how deeply you feel about them."
48431,Lisa,i can't eat this.
48438,Lisa,"fat tony, it's not important what other people think of you. what matters is how you feel, inside!"
48442,Lisa,michael?
48449,Lisa,yes?
48456,Lisa,that is the most unfair...
48457,Lisa,"bart, does that even mean anything?"
48465,Lisa,i did? how?
48475,Lisa,sure.
48480,Lisa,now it's a collection of candle kiosks and persian cd stores.
48485,Lisa,"whatever, i've got some paper to mâché."
48499,Lisa,dad! a flying saucer blew up that statue!
48501,Lisa,fur is murder! when's the krusty movie coming out?
48511,Lisa,"moe, these fragments are fascinating. ""i was in the christmas pageant once. mom showed up with a new boyfriend. he called me steve."""
48519,Lisa,"the wordloaf festival?! you'll meet all the great american writers, moe! you have to go!"
48521,Lisa,it's tom wolfe! he uses more exclamation points than any other major american writer.
48524,Lisa,but how can you--
48526,Lisa,you guys go ahead. i don't think i'd be very good company...
48527,Lisa,"moe, you're a heartless jerk!"
48534,Lisa,how can we forget? mom says now we can't afford to go to the orthodontist.
48535,Lisa,grampa's been watching us.
48538,Lisa,mom! bart's drinking coffee!
48539,Lisa,i hope everything's okay.
48541,Lisa,you actually convinced people not to go to nelson's party?
48542,Lisa,"ah c'mon bart, the party will be fun. nelson's not bad -- all he needs is a little kindness."
48558,Lisa,"dad, you can read to me anytime."
48561,Lisa,"what? no! i mean, that's a given. but also, the malibu stacy pony beach party set with sparkle sand. it's sold out everywhere."
48562,Lisa,really?
48565,Lisa,it's christmas! it's christmas! it's christmas!
48569,Lisa,back to scottsdale.
48570,Lisa,end of story.
48572,Lisa,there he is!
48576,Lisa,ugh. this is the most disgusting place we've ever gone.
48584,Lisa,bart!
48591,Lisa,"frère jacques, frère jacques / dormez-vous, dormez-vous..."
48604,Lisa,"but it didn't bring your parents back. tell me, big boy, was it really worth it?"
48606,Lisa,i've got to give a presentation about our family's heritage. but ours is so boring!
48610,Lisa,"you're right. i'll just need to find ""traditional garb""..."
48616,Lisa,"uh, thank you and goodnight."
48631,Lisa,"at bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. and you know what? no monsters have gotten me yet."
48634,Lisa,"lisa simpson, with the school paper."
48643,Lisa,hm... maybe the best way to begin your education is to get you some exposure to the wider world. so i'm gonna take you to downtown springfield!
48648,Lisa,"mrs. skin-ner is ""mame""!"
48653,Lisa,"cletus, i think you're spending too much of the kids' earnings on yourself."
48654,Lisa,stop the tour!
48656,Lisa,'tweren't nothin'.
48659,Lisa,pong!
48662,Lisa,"as always, i have some ideas."
48667,Lisa,it begins.
48671,Lisa,happy birthday dear homer / happy birthday to you!
48674,Lisa,i picked my malibu stacy hybrid convertible. it runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.
48676,Lisa,"i agree, mom, it's very sad. but we'll have to move on -- it's not like we can restage all our family photos."
48679,Lisa,"yes, but why does it have to be in my bedroom?"
48683,Lisa,no! should i attach it for you?
48684,Lisa,and this website will tell you the weather.
48690,Lisa,"you tell him, jesminder!"
48692,Lisa,what happened to the ref?
48693,Lisa,"dad, where'd you get that outfit?"
48706,Lisa,"dad, i can't forgive you because there's nothing to forgive."
48713,Lisa,"bart, come with me. i'll take you to someone who will make you feel better."
48717,Lisa,the person who hates bart more than anyone else. look!
48723,Lisa,then i guess you wouldn't mind eating one.
48727,Lisa,make her stop!
48729,Lisa,i've read that people do strange things in their sleep when they've taken ambien -- i mean nappien.
48730,Lisa,"see? ""may cause dry mouth, mood swings, and nighttime kookiness."""
48733,Lisa,"mom, is dad stealing from people he's supposed to help?"
48746,Lisa,"what if santa's little helper stops being a police dog? then he can get a non-violent job, like barking songs on novelty christmas records. you can do it, boy!"
48751,Lisa,"good work, database."
48752,Lisa,i've got a visual.
48758,Lisa,i've lost milhouse.
48759,Lisa,"principal skinner, you know we have only one agent who stands a chance with those bullies. my brother."
48760,Lisa,"principal skinner, as we both know, but you might need reminding, the annual bake sale provides ninety percent of the school's funding."
48765,Lisa,so true.
48766,Lisa,we have a fire alarm in the ventilation room!
48775,Lisa,"yeah, dad."
48781,Lisa,"you're going to the dentist too, dad."
48789,Lisa,not true. you've got the guts -- and i've got a web cam! this time you can tell the truth...
48790,Lisa,here we go. four-three-two...
48800,Lisa,you're our hero!
48803,Lisa,"dad, all you circled were the ""i's"" and ""a's""."
48807,Lisa,we crashed a funeral!
48811,Lisa,"no, no. it's a good thing."
48812,Lisa,the dance isn't till next week.
48814,Lisa,i don't see anything suspicious... except someone is loudly unwrapping their candy.
48815,Lisa,no.
48824,Lisa,creative responses for infant edu-loving!
48828,Lisa,you sound weird.
48833,Lisa,"whatever we did, we're sorry."
48836,Lisa,"oh my god, an alien! i'm gonna blow rachel goodman away at show-and-tell!"
48838,Lisa,"fiber-optic cable, uranium two thirty-five, two tickets to ""avenue q"", seven billion body bags..."
48840,Lisa,way to get rid of bart. he can be such a pest.
48842,Lisa,"ha, you missed them! bart and our alien friend are hundreds of miles away by now."
48843,Lisa,i can't believe that an alien who looked so evil turned out to be bad.
48845,Lisa,"i'm concerned we might be heading down a slippery slope. what do you think, nelson?"
48851,Lisa,who is it?
48859,Lisa,"aw, it's okay."
48863,Lisa,look at all these alternative comic book creators...
48864,Lisa,"alan moore, art spiegelman... oh, dan clowes!"
48866,Lisa,mm-hm.
48867,Lisa,"mom, every workout appointment is booked up for months! we'll have to open a second shapes. we just need to find a vacant rental property. hmm..."
48876,Lisa,"yummy, yumma!"
48880,Lisa,that voice!
48889,Lisa,feet? killing?! we gotta save bart!
48890,Lisa,now!
48893,Lisa,he would never get a shakespeare quote wrong --
48897,Lisa,...his father could take that opportunity to inject bob with a powerful drug that simulated death.
48899,Lisa,stop that cremation!
48900,Lisa,i grew suspicious when i saw the casket had extra room built in for your feet.
48904,Lisa,i think it's exciting -- springfield is the center of the political universe. i feel like a pundit in a think tank!
48906,Lisa,"mom, they're taking ralph's candidacy seriously! this is a disaster."
48907,Lisa,oh dear god.
48909,Lisa,ow!
48911,Lisa,"leave him alone, you vultures!"
48912,Lisa,ralph and i used to date.
48913,Lisa,"ralph, they have no right to do this to you. they just want to use you."
48919,Lisa,"you know, mom and dad are almost forty, and bart is ten. that means you didn't have him until way after high school."
48920,Lisa,we're in every kind of therapy!
48936,Lisa,dad?
48937,Lisa,see that hippo rolling in dung? you're the dung.
48944,Lisa,forget it.
48946,Lisa,"grab onto this! c'mon, wake up!"
48954,Lisa,we-were-never-outside-we-were-here-all-day.
48959,Lisa,idiot!
48964,Lisa,give me an indian burn!
48968,Lisa,i can't live with the guilt. i'm going to martin's house... to end it all!
48969,Lisa,bart! no! don't do...
48985,Lisa,"the last book in the series goes on sale at midnight, and we're gonna go stand in line."
48998,Lisa,well... she danced into her seventies.
48999,Lisa,this is how i always stand when i tell adults what they should be doing.
49012,Lisa,"no, stop buying me leg warmers! i'm already wearing six pairs!"
49013,Lisa,"lisa, mom. i'm lisa."
49014,Lisa,when's our next break?
49017,Lisa,a sturgeon is a fish.
49025,Lisa,ballet is unnatural and unfair to women. i shall now cast off the shoes of oppression!
49027,Lisa,dad... dad? wake up!
49029,Lisa,"i'm delivering your scout gal cookies, mayor quimby! that'll be thirty dollars!"
49039,Lisa,ew!
49052,Lisa,come on.
49057,Lisa,of course he did. his food is laced with growth hormones.
49060,Lisa,"well, your friend mary from 4-h lives on a farm -- lou can stay with her!"
49065,Lisa,"wait! if you stop the wedding, bart's cow will die! and he really cares about that cow... and bart doesn't usually care about stuff, so... help."
49069,Lisa,"i'm sorry, but as a filmmaker i have to face the truth."
49071,Lisa,i can start working on my school video project. the assignment is to film the beauty of the everyday. so let's see...
49076,Lisa,the man is an idiot!
49079,Lisa,orlando or hollywood?
49088,Lisa,"no dad, i want you to play homer simpson."
49099,Lisa,"happy birthday, mom."
49100,Lisa,i didn't mean it like that! a lot of things got changed in the editing room.
49108,Lisa,nelson? he couldn't have made a movie by himself. who helped him?
49115,Lisa,i wanna go lecture the food court businesses that are still using styrofoam!
49122,Lisa,we fooled her... betsy.
49130,Lisa,i found them on her nightstand.
49132,Lisa,but she'll live on forever in what you did today.
49133,Lisa,"yay, bart!"
49134,Lisa,that's not fair -- bart was great.
49136,Lisa,"in fact, the intern thing could open up a whole new world of free labor for you! did you know the discovery channel doesn't have a single paid employee?"
49139,Lisa,so do a global change?
49142,Lisa,mitzi gaynor?
49145,Lisa,my job: making you look good.
65539,Marge,now what?
57348,Marge,guess i can't complain. everything's perfect here.
57350,Marge,"i've been so bored since we moved here, i've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. i know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but i just can't drink that much."
65543,Marge,"i don't know, i don't know! i'm sure i don't know!"
57351,Marge,"it's up to you, homer. whatever you decide, that's what we'll do."
57353,Marge,well explain to me why it isn't.
57361,Marge,"homer, why are they saying you're going to fight drederick tatum?"
65560,Marge,no one stays in the sinkhole!
57368,Marge,what? what?! what am i missing? what?
65563,Marge,this car looks a little small. is the engine powerful?
57375,Marge,"next to spring and winter, fall is my absolute favorite season. just look at all this beautiful foilage."
57376,Marge,"that's what i said, foilage . it doesn't take a nucular scientist to pronounce foilage."
65569,Marge,well i don't like it.
65571,Marge,darn car won't start.
65574,Marge,what are you talking about?
65577,Marge,i do!
65581,Marge,"homer, why do you take a three second pause before you answer what i say?"
65584,Marge,"...but we aren't making a baby. i thought we should check, to make sure homer has... you know, working stunt-men in his cannon."
57392,Marge,kidnapped?!
57395,Marge,no excuses! just do it!
65592,Marge,okay.
65600,Marge,"so, you don't want another baby? how long have you felt this way?"
65602,Marge,we're not talking!
65603,Marge,you were pocket-dialed!
65604,Marge,shush!
65605,Marge,"homer... homer, this is the point where i really have to know what you want."
57410,Marge,springfield doesn't want places like this!
57414,Marge,"is that so? well, sleazy entertainment and raunchy jokes will never be as popular as sobriety and self-denial!"
57421,Marge,i rest my case.
65614,Marge,i still feel guilty. your father's not going to be around forever.
57429,Marge,i'm so sorry. how can i ever make this up to you?
57432,Marge,you're talking about a trough! we're not going to eat from a trough! and another thing -- it's only 5:15. why are you in your underwear?
57433,Marge,"at least let's have a civilized conversation, shall we? lisa, how was school?"
57435,Marge,i know it's not! i'm going into the dining room to have a conversation. anyone who wants to join me is welcome.
65633,Marge,sh! here comes lisa's solo!
57445,Marge,homer?!
65638,Marge,"homer, pay attention!"
57448,Marge,"and now it's too late -- they're here. bart, greet our guests and take their coats."
57449,Marge,"so, did anyone see that new woodsy allen movie?"
57451,Marge,maybe we should all have a few drinks.
65645,Marge,that adult etch-a-sketch certainly has brightened your mood.
57453,Marge,i feel terrible. the van houtens split up at our party.
57454,Marge,"i shouldn't have served those north korean fortune cookies. they were so insulting: ""you are a coward."" no one likes to hear that after a nice meal."
65648,Marge,put that down! we're being audited!
65649,Marge,"homie, you want to read to maggie before she goes to sleep?"
57457,Marge,"actually, luann, i don't really know anything about yo--"
57459,Marge,remember? luann and chase are taking us out to hear spalding gray.
65652,Marge,well... i like that its message is in sap and not in blood... like some miracles i could mention. passover.
57458,Marge,"homer, get ready!"
65654,Marge,"don't call satan! so what if the message wasn't a miracle? the answer isn't in syrup from god or a computer tablet, the answer is that the hope you felt was real."
65657,Marge,"relax, kids, just be yourselves."
65659,Marge,oh... satire.
65661,Marge,great paper.
57471,Marge,"i will. oh homie, of course i will."
65667,Marge,"maybe we shouldn't rush things with the new neighbors. you know, we might not all be a perfect match."
65668,Marge,but i always thought you were cool.
57476,Marge,but you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars. it's nothing but panhandling!
65670,Marge,ooo! hygiene!
57479,Marge,"he's a whole new person, lisa!"
57480,Marge,"ooh, a rubik's cube. let's all work it together."
57481,Marge,"it's true, but he shouldn't say it."
57483,Marge,why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
65676,Marge,"geez, is this a kid's birthday party or the place a bad guy kidnaps you to in a movie?"
57488,Marge,it's dying down!
65685,Marge,"see, see what i'm dealing with here, ned? we invited them here, and they repay us with insults and judgments."
65686,Marge,the cool people are everywhere! somehow they've even made the weather rainier!
65698,Marge,"the animal shelter hasn't had any greyhounds turned in. just a dachshund, a chow, and a pregnant raccoon."
65701,Marge,focus!
65702,Marge,"well, tell us your version."
65704,Marge,just hug already!
65705,Marge,homie?
57515,Marge,"i'm ""cranky"" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. you broke your promise, homer."
65708,Marge,where do they go?
57516,Marge,"don't ""soul mate"" me!"
65711,Marge,"calm down, everyone. calm down. i'm sure they'll have us out of here soon."
65716,Marge,what move? we haven't moved! what's going on?!
57524,Marge,...a profound mystical understanding?
57526,Marge,we'll all be killed!
65727,Marge,"homer simpson! when i fell in love with you, it was because of your big heart and your good looks. but some day those good looks are gonna fade."
57536,Marge,"i-is this about that pen that i took from the post office? i-i swear i didn't know i put it in my purse. then i was going to bring it back, but the dog chewed it up and that just made things worse..."
65729,Marge,good boy.
65734,Marge,and this goes too.
65741,Marge,"i'm not sure if you gave my son any... extra help. but if you did, thank you."
57550,Marge,"well, maybe it's all for the best..."
65748,Marge,i guess you do know your weather.
65754,Marge,"homie, we made it!"
65755,Marge,are you pushing?
57565,Marge,"hairnets, everyone."
57566,Marge,welcome to pretzel wagon. may i take your order?
57568,Marge,excuse me. i had this spot first.
57569,Marge,"well, i guess macy's and gimbel's learned to live side by side."
57570,Marge,very well. there must be dozens of great locations in this town. don't you worry about me.
57577,Marge,"listen to your mother, kids: aim low. aim so low, no one will even care if you succeed."
65772,Marge,"so, surfing is really your job?"
65774,Marge,homie... it's been a wonderful day... but do you think maybe we're moving a little too quickly?
57584,Marge,"oh, oh, you have to push in as you turn."
57585,Marge,"yeah, that's it."
65778,Marge,i guess. as long as we don't make it a habit.
57589,Marge,"oh, it just sickens me. how could you do this to someone you love?"
57593,Marge,the answer is no.
65787,Marge,"look, before anyone says anything else, how could you possibly think you could get our kids?"
57598,Marge,"okay, but when you start getting apple-cheeked, it's time to come in."
65791,Marge,"on main street, turn right now... / our sunday drive is ruined! hands at ten and two!"
65792,Marge,homer simpson! did you take maggie to moe's?
65793,Marge,i was the only one without a date at patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening!
57600,Marge,hello?
57603,Marge,there they are! let me down here.
57605,Marge,"we're over here, homie!"
57609,Marge,what?!
65804,Marge,"maybe instead of watching tv with the kids, you could take them outside and... what are you doing?"
57612,Marge,all right... but don't be shocked.
65806,Marge,i'm afraid so.
65807,Marge,while bart turned out so wonderful in his own way!
57615,Marge,well... i was thinking we could hire a nanny to help me out.
57624,Marge,homer!
57625,Marge,"well that's nice, kids, but i don't know where we're going to find anyone like that."
57627,Marge,"shary bobbins, you're just what we're looking for."
57628,Marge,"my, she seems too good to be true."
65821,Marge,now what are you doing?
57631,Marge,ooooh.
57632,Marge,"oh, thank you."
65829,Marge,do you think lisa went to that jazz club i wouldn't take her to?
65833,Marge,he's ten years old!
65834,Marge,i want to know what it's for.
57643,Marge,i need to purchase a brassiere. you kids wait over here in the credit department.
57650,Marge,"it's not your fault, homer. it's those lousy writers. they make me madder than a, um... yak in heat!"
65847,Marge,help me out of the closet! wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death.
65848,Marge,how about some fatties?
57658,Marge,"oh, no. oh, no, no, no, no. no. it's a very, very old figurine."
65852,Marge,"don't you want to be happy, abe? admit who you are, a wonderful gay man!"
65857,Marge,"your grandfather is not psycho! the only thing he's ""straight-up"" is loves you."
57665,Marge,he prefers the company of men!
65860,Marge,"i know your grampa seems exciting now... but all that preening and cheating, those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy."
57669,Marge,"i'm very sorry you feel that way. because john invited us all out for a drive today, and we're going."
65863,Marge,"oh, that was so sweet."
57671,Marge,"homer, at least come out and say hello."
65865,Marge,it's not chinchilla. i just thought she needed more sleep.
57676,Marge,"so if you wore a hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?"
57679,Marge,"homer, john brought us cactus candy!"
65873,Marge,a teacher can't be a bully.
57683,Marge,"just remember, bart, convicts aren't ""cool."" they're bad people."
57684,Marge,someone should really go up there and talk to him.
57688,Marge,but he's safely locked away!
57690,Marge,which is impossible!
57693,Marge,you can't ask god to kill someone!
57694,Marge,"oh, that sounds fabulous, homer. stores throw the best parties."
57695,Marge,you didn't remember that. you just saw it on tv.
65888,Marge,"if they can be that rude, the food must be great!"
57698,Marge,"actually, bart, lisa is going to be in charge tonight."
57702,Marge,"uh, i don't think we should be driving here. the mayor's yelling at us."
65897,Marge,lousy.
57705,Marge,"oooh, malaria zone! that's where all the explorers shop."
65900,Marge,in-ground?
57709,Marge,"young lady, you will never babysit again! i am so disappointed -ointed... - ointed... -ointed..."
65904,Marge,"well, that does sound good..."
57720,Marge,beer!
57721,Marge,"you're the one the papers have been talking about. that mysterious ""beer baron"" who's been supplying springfield with alcohol! how have you been getting away with this?"
57724,Marge,whooh...
65919,Marge,"really? jeez, they make everything."
57727,Marge,"you've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. why not quit now, while you're ahead?"
57728,Marge,"that was a very sweet thing you did for poor wiggum, but what's going to happen to you?"
65923,Marge,"not because of what you bought, but because i realized that no matter what, you will never stop trying. and there's nothing a woman loves more than that."
65924,Marge,actually i'm cool with one of them.
57731,Marge,"oh, my goodness."
57732,Marge,"homer, bart's up there!"
57734,Marge,"homer, this is yours."
65930,Marge,but they let me take fabric samples!
57738,Marge,"bart, where did you get all this stuff?"
57741,Marge,"that's laddie. bart says he won him at a church carnival, two towns over."
57743,Marge,"oh, it's against the house rule... oh, i guess just this once."
57744,Marge,"homer, are you wearing a tie to impress laddie?"
57745,Marge,"well, we wrecked the first dog. we've got to treat this one right. bart, why don't you take laddie for another walk."
57749,Marge,"well, if that's what you think is best, let's just go down to the kennel and get santa's little helper back."
57755,Marge,"they're not going to close the plant, are they?"
57758,Marge,"lisa, nobody likes a gloater. right, homie?"
57762,Marge,oh my goodness. kids! homer! we're late for church! i'm glad i dressed last night.
65957,Marge,homer simpson!
65958,Marge,i sent you to the store to get applesauce for maggie two hours ago!
57765,Marge,church shouldn't be a chore. it should help you in your daily life.
57768,Marge,it's crazy!
65962,Marge,"moe, this trip is about turning your life around."
57772,Marge,wow.
57775,Marge,me?
65969,Marge,yes. 'cause every time you wear it you'll know how much we love you. like the one pair of blue pants i bought homer twenty years ago.
65975,Marge,moe? what are you doing?
65984,Marge,"got it, music lessons!"
65986,Marge,i was thinking something more artistic. something musical. you could take advantage of a fantastic musician living right here!
65987,Marge,that's okay. i...
65988,Marge,"let's go, bart..."
65989,Marge,"so, how much are lessons?"
57796,Marge,hmmm. oh well.
65994,Marge,lesson over.
57802,Marge,sorry.
57811,Marge,"""marge"" is already taken? oh, how about ""marjorie""?"
66009,Marge,a proud mother always does.
66010,Marge,i'd like to go home now. and to think you'd do this on mother's day.
57819,Marge,"you're afraid to go to work because frank grimes will be there, aren't you?"
57826,Marge,remember me? my name is marge! / the tv mom whose hair is large!
57831,Marge,i know. and i made your favorite --
66026,Marge,i've had it! no more karate monsters!
66027,Marge,that's it -- tomorrow we're doing something educational! we're going to the science museum!
57834,Marge,"in a minute, homie. i have to get the door."
57836,Marge,christian love?
57837,Marge,but don't you want to end world famine?
66032,Marge,you don't know where carl is from?
66034,Marge,you're going so far away. i'll miss you.
57845,Marge,"now, about your punishment, young man."
66040,Marge,just read the saga and see what it says.
57848,Marge,"you know, maybe chief wiggum is right. military school is a good idea."
57853,Marge,"oh, honey... i heard you the first time."
66049,Marge,"well in the first place, the elephant's cufflinks would be the same size. it's the cuffs that would be bigger. as for homer, i'm getting him a case of his favorite snack cakes, dolly madison."
66054,Marge,i'm a fan of animation.
66055,Marge,one more to go and i'm done.
57862,Marge,"wake up, everyone. we're almost there."
57866,Marge,"homer, you're scaring the children."
57867,Marge,the bus station is just one of the sights we came to see. we'll meet you in central park at five o'clock.
66065,Marge,tell me more.
57875,Marge,"stay where i can see you, honey..."
66075,Marge,there you go. good as new.
66076,Marge,no danishes!
57887,Marge,"i'm sorry, but that's just how i feel."
57890,Marge,and have ten items or less.
66085,Marge,hello! it's moe from moe's tavern.
66086,Marge,is it me or did this house just get classy?
57893,Marge,i came up with the idea.
57896,Marge,movies john travolta made...
66090,Marge,hmm... maybe i can help.
66094,Marge,i've never felt so flushed after watching public television.
66095,Marge,chat room?
57905,Marge,it's a shame what school can do.
57908,Marge,"sure, honey. bart had just completed his first day at school. and bart just..."
57909,Marge,"sorry, lisa. it's just how the story goes. no matter what bart tried, he just couldn't fit in at school."
66103,Marge,get out of my head!
57918,Marge,"look, i knew private school would be expensive but i was hoping we could get a scholarship of some sort."
57920,Marge,and sometimes i feel so smothered by this family i just want to scream till my lungs explode! uh... i'll go start dinner now.
57924,Marge,"uhh... you keep 'em. now listen. if we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage lisa. umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the museum on saturday..."
66118,Marge,eat up.
66120,Marge,poor guy.
57931,Marge,"and so, just as things looked their worst..."
57932,Marge,"grampa, what are you talking about?"
57933,Marge,"as i was saying, things couldn't be worse for lisa or bart..."
57937,Marge,"homer, you know how unpredictable the french are. one minute they're kissing a woman's hand, the next they're chopping off her head. what if they start a war?"
66131,Marge,"couldn't agree more! now, to celebrate... ta-da! pork chops crusted with cheeto dust!"
66133,Marge,"oh my, what's that thing you're doing?"
57942,Marge,what's going on down there? what's all this mist?
57943,Marge,"oh, well, he may be a horrible freak, but he's still my son. i'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time."
66136,Marge,for the better! and men don't change that way!
66137,Marge,"do you know what we're doing on sunday? brunch with the hibberts, then the tile store! he's like a husband in a widow's memory -- perfect!"
66140,Marge,"now, i'm off to a party, my outfit is chic. it's a catwoman costume i'm sure is unique."
57955,Marge,not all of them...
66149,Marge,really? how?
57957,Marge,as for the rest of you...
66154,Marge,what are you doing?
66156,Marge,poor chip. such a big part of everyone's life.
57967,Marge,wouldn't we all suffocate?
57974,Marge,"homer, i told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table."
57975,Marge,it's the same table!
66168,Marge,"chief, what are you doing to save our son?"
57979,Marge,bart!
66172,Marge,"you know what i think about regrets? as long as your family is together, every choice you've ever made is the right one."
66174,Marge,did you eat a peanut?
57984,Marge,so we need a place to spend the night.
66177,Marge,"i'm sorry, but does kirk know how silly he looks?"
57989,Marge,yes.
66182,Marge,"postage, marked in pesetas? who are those letters from?"
66184,Marge,"homie, i thought a visit from your old pen pal would cheer you up."
66187,Marge,"i'm not used to strange men saying the word ""bedroom"" around me."
57999,Marge,sounds like you need some first aid.
58000,Marge,"he's going to need a... you know, ""protection."""
66195,Marge,i'm a little tired. could we just snuggle again?
66203,Marge,you can have one of these!
66207,Marge,what?!
66208,Marge,why are you saying that?
58017,Marge,"wow, homer coaching in the championship game. you must be pretty proud of your son."
58020,Marge,"don't be shy. uh, excuse me! excuse me, we have one more bachelor!"
58023,Marge,what?!
58029,Marge,right. how much longer is she gonna be here? homer was a little sketchy on the details.
66226,Marge,"it's true, i never specified the home."
66232,Marge,"oh, for god's sake."
66233,Marge,"lisa, your food's getting cold!"
58040,Marge,"maybe so, but i'd appreciate it if you didn't call them morons."
66236,Marge,lisa? is everything okay?
66237,Marge,because you're doing your homework and you don't look happy.
66241,Marge,you don't hear me listening to the thompson twins anymore. although...
66242,Marge,people's views change. bobby kennedy worked for joe mccarthy. larry david was on fridays.
66243,Marge,"isabel's only eight. as she grows up, surprising things will happen to her body... of beliefs. but she could always use a friend like you."
66244,Marge,"have a great day, kids. and bart, i'll pick you up after school to take you to karate lessons."
58049,Marge,"any time, my angel."
66249,Marge,"bart, sweetie, this is an opportunity for you to turn things around, yet again. and i believe in you. yet again."
66250,Marge,take a look at this.
58061,Marge,"homer, be careful..."
58064,Marge,mr. hutz! i didn't know you sold real estate.
66259,Marge,"well, you seem like a nice pushy stranger."
66260,Marge,these are our new boarders!
66272,Marge,i've opened up my house to you. and all you do is fill this joyous season with petty complaints.
58082,Marge,"why, yes it is..."
58092,Marge,that's a beauty.
66293,Marge,your country doesn't think illegally downloaded movies is wrong.
66294,Marge,how is that not stealing?
58103,Marge,"i'm sorry, mr. hutz, but i just can't lie to people."
58111,Marge,mm-hmm.
66304,Marge,ask body spray!
66308,Marge,"now remember, don't be the way you normally are, and sustain that for the rest of your life."
66314,Marge,now!
66319,Marge,what's so funny?
66322,Marge,are you using your glasses for snuggling?!
58131,Marge,no. my husband is... at church.
58132,Marge,how do you think i felt?
66325,Marge,here's your breakfast.
58136,Marge,"slow down, homer."
58138,Marge,that was close.
58140,Marge,bart! you're up early.
66334,Marge,such a good baby! you deserve some ice cream.
66335,Marge,"maggie, he's here!"
58148,Marge,unless...
58154,Marge,we still have each other. and isn't that the best gift of all?
58158,Marge,"we got the popcorn! did you get ""waiting to exhale?"""
58164,Marge,sure your dad's singing / could make your hair curl / but you too bart / have sung and danced like a girl.
66361,Marge,"bart, if this is what i think it is, it's not a place we should ever, ever take a little boy."
58170,Marge,"well, let's get eatin'."
66368,Marge,"hello. hello. i'm-i'm marge simpson. and i'm here to talk about a-a-a wonderful, beautiful thing--"
66375,Marge,i am so tired of those kids sniggering.
66379,Marge,are you saying i'm wasting my time?
58187,Marge,but when we ask you to do yardwork...
66382,Marge,"kids, today we have a very special guest -- my husband."
66383,Marge,"i brought homer here to show that we can, and have, abstained for two whole days."
66384,Marge,we're here to stop you -- with the help of the teenage abstinence class!
66386,Marge,"well, that's one of them!"
66392,Marge,"homie, homie, we'll be old someday."
66394,Marge,"homer, how are we doing with those cots?"
58204,Marge,i found some food for breakfast. i hope everyone likes the red things that grow on this tree.
58206,Marge,over the sink! over the sink!
66400,Marge,your day is my day! we're the same age! you're turning into your father!
66408,Marge,"lisa, your father and i are very concerned about all this hinting."
58216,Marge,i've never heard of these movementarians. are they some kind of church?
58217,Marge,but what if they try to talk us into something?
66412,Marge,lisa! you've just gotta choose one. lisa!?
66416,Marge,this could be our new living room painting!
58225,Marge,"when we got married, you promised me my harvesting days were over."
58226,Marge,"this is ridiculous, we're already married!"
66419,Marge,i've got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from kirk's bachelor bad. i hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected.
58228,Marge,"no-o-o-o-o-o-o!!! all righty, time for bed."
58229,Marge,"i'm leaving this place, and you'd better step aside!"
66422,Marge,"wow, the van houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth. think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them."
58230,Marge,reverend lovejoy! you've got to help me! my entire family has been taken in by the evil movementarians.
58233,Marge,"look, let's the three of us try it together."
66427,Marge,how about this... what if we give the van houtens twenty-five percent of the money?
58242,Marge,"hmm... would you like a tall frosty one, homer?"
58245,Marge,that's my husband!
58247,Marge,"ooh, it's so late. you kids have to go to bed."
66441,Marge,see what your greed has done?
58249,Marge,oh my goodness! that was a long movie! it's time for school! let's go! let's go!
58250,Marge,"have a great weekend, kids! be nice to the underprivileged countries."
66444,Marge,"oh, perfect. now that's art."
66447,Marge,olá!
58256,Marge,how about compuglobal hypermeganet?
66451,Marge,"""selecionar conta..."" ooh, ""select account""!"
66452,Marge,i did not pay seven ninety-nine for an app so i could use the english option.
58259,Marge,"ooo, look! this is a perfect chance to get you kids some nice church shoes."
58262,Marge,did you hear that kids? brown!
58263,Marge,perfect. you'll grow into them.
66459,Marge,i'll come back with the fire truck. i just have to get the kids to school first.
66460,Marge,lucas.
66461,Marge,no! you didn't hear anything!
66462,Marge,it's for people who haven't had heart problems!
66471,Marge,"no! homer, you can't just do the things you want to do. you have to act like someone you'd want lisa to marry. if you just act like yourself, she might just... oh, you know?"
58284,Marge,i'll go get the bactine.
58285,Marge,no snacks! dinner will be ready in three minutes!
58287,Marge,bart!
58288,Marge,i'm getting worried about lisa. she's been gone for hours.
58290,Marge,simpson gene? that's just foolishness.
66484,Marge,"oh, of course. you're right, honey. i'll just um, i'll park it at the bar."
66485,Marge,please let it be a bear that did this.
66487,Marge,horses only live thirty years!
66489,Marge,"thank you, moe."
66490,Marge,you're alive! but how?
58298,Marge,...and the floor was donated by american superball.
58299,Marge,"come on, maggie, let's try and find the enormous pendulum."
58300,Marge,wait there.
66495,Marge,let me just say this once: i'm good.
66500,Marge,it's only natural to miss a man you buried a hundred and twenty-seven times.
58310,Marge,"bart, you don't have to go anywhere today. i've got a surprise for you."
66505,Marge,maggie! why'd you do that?
58316,Marge,"he's just a misunderstood little boy who needs a friend. and, if he hangs around with you, well, everyone will think he's cool."
66516,Marge,i don't know... we have church the next morning... starts at eleven...
58325,Marge,permission granted.
66519,Marge,not the van houtens.
66522,Marge,we're going to that game party and we're going to be charming and witty.
58331,Marge,a dishonorable discharge! it's the best we could've hoped for.
66526,Marge,and stay in the living room. don't go to their kids' room and watch a basketball game.
66527,Marge,no.
58335,Marge,"you really had a lot of talent, kid."
66534,Marge,that's good.
58344,Marge,hmf. the monkey's on my part of the sofa.
66537,Marge,nothing. i give up. no more dinner parties. our whole social life will be us watching tv and you going to moe's.
66540,Marge,and lisa will get a friend.
58350,Marge,"oh, for pete sakes. why is that monkey wearing a diaper? i thought he was housebroken."
58353,Marge,"happy love day, everyone!"
58359,Marge,i heard that! you know the rule.
58363,Marge,"three, two, one..."
66557,Marge,awww.
66558,Marge,that's a prison road crew.
66568,Marge,but you wear that little spoon around your neck.
66569,Marge,yes. and i can tell how hard it was to lose your father. but at least you were there to share his final thoughts.
58378,Marge,no they didn't. you just brought a bucket of chicken to church.
66572,Marge,"yes, lisa?"
66577,Marge,mammogram appointment.
58387,Marge,has anyone mentioned that homer doesn't know anything about mountain climbing and that this is all crazy?
58389,Marge,"oh no, he fell! i can't look!"
66582,Marge,i-- i don't really know that much about--
66583,Marge,this has got to stop! if you don't go to work you're going to get fired!
58391,Marge,is that your wallet?
66585,Marge,i'm afraid homer and bart's problems are beyond our power to solve.
66587,Marge,"ooo, i'm getting a message from your father's fantasy football league. i must still be logged in as him."
58396,Marge,"""in case of accidental ingestion, consult a mortician."" oh my goodness!"
66591,Marge,well i don't like this trash talk. and i'm gonna do something about it. even if i have to bring in the big guns.
66592,Marge,"dear lord, please help homer's friends understand that make-believe computer football is no excuse for using the internet to be mean."
58403,Marge,what happened? you didn't do anything.
58404,Marge,"homer, what's going on? shouldn't you be at work?"
66602,Marge,ta-da!
66606,Marge,ned's letting us use his freezer to store the extra sandwiches.
66607,Marge,"homie, how much money do we have put aside in case something happens to you?"
66608,Marge,i'm in.
58416,Marge,"ohhh, look, homie. our wedding cake."
66610,Marge,all you can drink... if you buy a jumbo cup.
66614,Marge,"you seem to have had, and lost, a lot of jobs."
58426,Marge,"well, we used to..."
58427,Marge,ooh! who's a good boy?
58428,Marge,oh yes he is! yes he is!
58430,Marge,"i love him, too. g'night."
66631,Marge,you are working two jobs!
66633,Marge,"i said wash! and bart, go work the deep fryer."
66640,Marge,"kids, we're taking some shredded lettuce, pre-sliced cheese, and cold cuts and turning them into the american dream."
66646,Marge,"now i know why homie comes here so much. no matter how sad you are inside, what you see looks worse."
66649,Marge,"so you see, ms. zengler, the mother hubbard's express across the street is stealing all our business. it's not fair."
66651,Marge,oh. now i completely understand you.
66655,Marge,hear hear!
66656,Marge,homie! our prayers have been answered!
66660,Marge,"no. you should not be out glugging, shin-slicing, or eye groining! we've got a sweet little toddle to take care of!"
58468,Marge,"oh, it would have to be camera day."
58470,Marge,"kids, i want to explain about the stadium. y'see, sometimes moms and dads get a little... well, accustomed to each other."
58473,Marge,i am!
66666,Marge,"homer, do something!"
58475,Marge,"homer, that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight."
66671,Marge,huh. might as well clean this while i'm killing myself.
58480,Marge,lisa...
66674,Marge,...so they need a place to stay. here.
66677,Marge,you know what? i trust them not to smoke.
58486,Marge,"oh, honey, don't eat that. wouldn't you rather have your sugar bag?"
58488,Marge,you're thirty-nine.
66681,Marge,but our water was on fire.
66686,Marge,our. water. was. on. fire!
58495,Marge,i didn't tell you to quit your job.
58498,Marge,"homer, that's not a table, that's our dryer."
66692,Marge,well that's better.
66693,Marge,i thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love. like in epcot center.
58501,Marge,"hm. i brought you a tuna sandwich. they say it's brain food. i guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are."
58503,Marge,that's every woman's nightmare.
58507,Marge,they're terrible.
66705,Marge,"well, anyway bart, you'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend."
58513,Marge,that was your idea!
66709,Marge,why do i ever put you in charge of the littlest thing?
58517,Marge,please submit their names along with ninety-five dollars for each handsome volume you wish to order.
58521,Marge,slow and steady wins the race.
66716,Marge,"finally. a normal person. thank you, miss... um..."
58526,Marge,"nelson's a troubled, lonely, sad little boy. he needs to be isolated from everyone."
66728,Marge,the bass guitar? this doesn't really seem like... you.
66729,Marge,i can't take it. all homer does is play that stupid bass! doink doink doink doink doink doink doink!
66736,Marge,"you didn't join a band to become famous like in ""almost famous."" you loved playing music with your friends. that was enough to make you happy."
58550,Marge,why are you sitting like that? what are you hiding this time?
66744,Marge,one night. the one night of the year i want homer home with his family and he can't even do that.
66746,Marge,"i never thought i'd say this to someone i cared for, much less my husband, but i'm saying it now: i don't want you here on christmas."
66747,Marge,out now.
58556,Marge,i see a foot!
58557,Marge,no kickboxing!
66751,Marge,okay then!
66752,Marge,"moe szyslak. you didn't climb down our chimney just to say ""merry christmas."""
66755,Marge,no answer. let's go find your father.
66756,Marge,what? i never give up hope.
66760,Marge,"well, he's not in the neon sign store."
58569,Marge,"may i remind you that two people are dead? oh, wait. i just got it."
66764,Marge,"homie, i'm your present tonight. and the present is that i'm not gonna always assume that you screwed up. because i realize maybe there's a good explanation for what you do. or a crazy one that's pretty entertaining."
66766,Marge,you didn't have to do that. i love you just the same.
66767,Marge,"okay, remember we're parked in the ""ethnic princess"" section."
66770,Marge,homer... homer...
58579,Marge,oh my god!
58584,Marge,i guess i've been in denial. homer... kang is maggie's father.
58587,Marge,"i absolutely refuse to go along with this. but since i have no choice, i'll take the alley."
58591,Marge,"nine months later, i gave birth to maggie."
58594,Marge,"oh, you couldn't destroy every politician."
58599,Marge,stop calling everyone suckers!
66796,Marge,homer... you're not going to school.
58608,Marge,"homer, when did you become a member of p.e.t.a.?"
58609,Marge,but that's not what p.e.t.a. stands--
66806,Marge,"oh, so good to have you back."
66807,Marge,"thank you, sven-golly. i knitted us a blanket."
58618,Marge,and that poncho is filthy! let me dry-clean it for you.
58624,Marge,"uh, it's that pair of dockers you wanted. 48 waist with the balloon seat, right?"
66817,Marge,"goodbye, elon. our town will never forgive you!"
66819,Marge,"oh, thank you, homie!"
66821,Marge,our kids just did something amazing!
66823,Marge,"i'm sorry but i can't. i'm tired of you saying planes have gotten smaller, and two presidents were fatter than you, and..."
58631,Marge,"oh, we've got to get you home to a warm blanket and a cold compress."
66825,Marge,you don't have to do this alone.
66826,Marge,"well that's great, homie. just let me finish uploading this photo."
58637,Marge,lisa!
66830,Marge,that's worse than what i thought!
58640,Marge,you shouldn't be watching the learning channel. you need to take it easy.
66836,Marge,"oh, kids, stop arguing. or keep arguing. i don't care. homer, i'm sorry i tried to help you control your weight. i'm not sure of anything anymore. sorry i ever open my mouth."
58644,Marge,with eight years of scrupulous honesty.
66838,Marge,"it's not that professor x wouldn't get up, it's that he couldn't."
66839,Marge,that's not really what i was--
58647,Marge,"the water's boiling! quick, chuck him in!"
58648,Marge,come on! chuck him in!
58649,Marge,let's go! in the pot. in the pot.
66844,Marge,you're already drinking at eight o'clock in the morning? how much have you had?
58652,Marge,lisa broke her own record -- by two whole plusses!
58653,Marge,"oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. by the way, i oiled the hinge on your diary."
66849,Marge,so you're a taxi?
58658,Marge,who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?
66855,Marge,"you're welcome. and if you really want to get your belly button pierced, go see a professional."
58663,Marge,this should be very educational. i want you kids to pay attention.
66863,Marge,"moe, i think we'd both be a lot happier if we quit our new jobs."
58671,Marge,homer!
66868,Marge,majesty.
66871,Marge,but you don't go to our church.
58679,Marge,no.
58681,Marge,"i'll tell you when you're dead, grampa."
66875,Marge,even i saw that. i guess i can't tell homer.
58683,Marge,homer!
66878,Marge,"huh? oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... the revue."
58687,Marge,i've got maggie.
66880,Marge,both.
58688,Marge,"homer, i don't think you were listening to what he just--"
66882,Marge,disguises? i'm worried that our scam is becoming dishonest.
66883,Marge,"ok, mel. i'll be at the casino by ten. meet me at the lounge by the j. geils cover band."
58689,Marge,"oh, for pete's sake."
58693,Marge,homer! i don't want you using your new sleeper hold on the children.
66888,Marge,"i'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money. but until then, i appreciate you keeping this very grown-up secret."
58699,Marge,dust!!!
66898,Marge,my family loves your microwave lasagnas.
66906,Marge,"isn't bart sweet, homer? he sings like a little angel."
58715,Marge,what the dilly-yo?
58719,Marge,when was the last time you played citizenship?
66920,Marge,"kids, you want to go christmas shopping?"
58728,Marge,"oooh, ""free foot pain analysis?"""
58734,Marge,"okay... oh, leather craft."
58735,Marge,mm-hm. what about clay? you got any problem with clay?
58739,Marge,"hmm, lisa, i don't want to alarm you, but i'm not finding any."
66932,Marge,yes...
58740,Marge,nothing! i can't believe vincent price would lend his name to such a shoddy product.
66936,Marge,he said he went caroling with bart.
66948,Marge,and a short temper.
66951,Marge,bart?
66956,Marge,"homer, you're going, too."
66958,Marge,"there's no guy with peanuts, dear."
58770,Marge,"eh, maybe later."
58771,Marge,are you sure it's a federal law that i have to dance with you?
58773,Marge,i don't know. remember that new year's eve at lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!
66967,Marge,"there, there, homer. you'll find a job. you've caused plenty of industrial accidents and you've always bounced back."
58775,Marge,swab? i thought it was a spray.
58779,Marge,to what?
66975,Marge,"don't be nervous. we believe in you, homer."
66979,Marge,you don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses?
58787,Marge,"tomorrow?! well, that's too bad, mister. i'm not gonna bail you out this time."
66982,Marge,"oh, what an adorable little girl."
66984,Marge,ummm... maybe i will take you up on that punch.
66987,Marge,"well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there and if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average. i don't want to alarm anyone, but i think there's a li'l al-key-hol in this punch."
66989,Marge,drink the drink that i have made.
66990,Marge,he's here at last my one and only. good-bye friends and don't be lonely.
66991,Marge,hey homie. did you try the punch?
58797,Marge,deal!
58799,Marge,and what's in this?
66996,Marge,ohh!
58808,Marge,either put that book down or let me drive.
58809,Marge,ooo.
58810,Marge,i'd love to look at sculleryweek -- if you're through with it.
67004,Marge,but we don't have that kind of money.
58813,Marge,"hey, look at this one. it's a poem. from apu!"
58815,Marge,the only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower.
58817,Marge,hmmm... sometimes i find pickle slices in the sheets.
58819,Marge,"then the bird sang ""i love the night life""... with clever new lyrics."
67013,Marge,bart! lisa! stop that.
67015,Marge,these are for lisa's class.
58824,Marge,"oh, isn't that sweet."
67022,Marge,bart!
58830,Marge,"oh, i'm gonna snuggle your brains out."
58831,Marge,"no, no, as soon as i get over, that lane will stop moving. erma bombeck said so, and dave barry agrees."
58835,Marge,you cashed in your 401 to buy that stupid canyonero. why can't you drive it?
67031,Marge,huh huh. and i'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either.
58839,Marge,"ooh! oh, i guess i can drive it for a little while."
67033,Marge,"so tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. you'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go."
67034,Marge,are you boys through playing war?
67035,Marge,good. then here are some cupcakes.
58840,Marge,hang on. the manual says i need to log on to the onboard computer.
58844,Marge,"hmm, i thought it was sandy duncan."
58845,Marge,"oh, crud. and we're so close to the house."
67039,Marge,but they sent a note from school.
58847,Marge,"oh, i don't know... it doesn't seem right."
67041,Marge,"lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs and i'll draw you a nice hot bath? that helps me when i feel sad."
58855,Marge,nobody will ever cut me off again!
67051,Marge,"well you do, don't you?"
67053,Marge,"go on, bart. no time like the present."
58861,Marge,this better be important.
58862,Marge,"ooo, did i ever. and that herbal anger rinse just washed the rage right out of me."
58865,Marge,"oh, for crying out loud... i--"
58868,Marge,how could they take away my license? it feels like i lost a limb.
67061,Marge,"boys, i'd like your attention, please."
67063,Marge,"oh, calm down, homer. lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family."
67067,Marge,"i don't think we can afford this, homer."
58875,Marge,"c'mon, homer! jump!"
67070,Marge,what are you two doing back there?
58881,Marge,"wake up, homer."
58882,Marge,"c'mon, move your butt! you're blocking traffic!"
67075,Marge,"oh, homer. what are we going to do?"
67076,Marge,it is?
58891,Marge,maggie?!
58898,Marge,"okay, then you can take lisa to dr. hibbert's."
58900,Marge,bad cat! leave her alone!
67093,Marge,why should i feel like a traffic cop every sunday morning when i'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family.
67094,Marge,"c'mon everybody, we're late. bart, i want you to promise me you'll pay attention in sunday school. bart? bart? bart!!"
67095,Marge,what's this? a personal stereo? were you going to listen to rock music in sunday school?
67096,Marge,"can you believe this, homer? ... homer? ... homer?"
58905,Marge,"hm. well, i guess we both learned a lesson. but if anybody asks, you hit him."
67100,Marge,"yeah. sit down, homer."
67101,Marge,"homer, you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation, and today's sermon was one you should have really listened to."
67102,Marge,gambling.
67108,Marge,it's a statue of the trailblazing founder of our town.
58917,Marge,"no, homer! don't fill up on bread!"
58918,Marge,"oh no. oh, no..."
67112,Marge,"homer, did you have something to do with this?"
58924,Marge,a musical doorbell!
67117,Marge,"patty, he's out buying me something right now."
58927,Marge,i'm trying to find a particular tune. it's the one that goes like dah-da-dahhh dah-da-dahhh.
58937,Marge,"this is it, honey. we did it."
67132,Marge,you never intended for me to use that ball.
67136,Marge,"i'm keeping it and i'm going to use it. thank you for the present, homer."
58944,Marge,"okay, okay! let me just get the wire cutters."
67139,Marge,"no, thanks. i'm just here out of spite."
58949,Marge,"uh, aren't you hurt?"
58952,Marge,"well, some general-interest magazines would be nice."
67148,Marge,"oh, no, no. homer is my... ball's name. i'm marge."
67151,Marge,hmmm.
58960,Marge,"yes, god."
67160,Marge,you're a very good teacher!
58970,Marge,why aren't we ascending into heaven?
58976,Marge,how's your father's project coming along?
58978,Marge,is everything okay? i got worried when i didn't hear any shots.
58985,Marge,i'm happy for you. now g'night.
58986,Marge,"no, homer, being an artist was my dream. but now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than i have in my whole life."
58989,Marge,"well, i guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy."
67183,Marge,"oh! oh! well, all right."
58992,Marge,it's so exciting to do something cultural together.
58994,Marge,"now this is a joseph turner. in an era when everyone else painted portraits, he broke away by painting the venetian canals."
58997,Marge,homer... homer...
58999,Marge,"oh, that can't be good."
67192,Marge,we're... uh...
59001,Marge,i think some people are going to be upset.
59006,Marge,that's us.
59009,Marge,"no one's gonna jinx you, homer. in fact, we're rooting for you."
59013,Marge,"so, bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism?"
59014,Marge,sounds good to me!
67207,Marge,of course.
59020,Marge,give me my baby!
67218,Marge,go take some wildlife pictures or something.
59031,Marge,"ooo, looks like something exciting's happening. well, we'll have to read about it in tomorrow's paper."
67224,Marge,"okay, but don't dawdle. your food will get cold."
59033,Marge,where'd you get that champagne?
59034,Marge,all this commotion just for a store?
67227,Marge,princess who?
59036,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, but... oh, it really is."
67229,Marge,"bart, go to your room!"
67231,Marge,my suggestion is for you to sleep in the filth you created.
59039,Marge,"oh, i don't think mr. burns would like that show."
59040,Marge,run!
59041,Marge,i was really starting to enjoy ethnic mismatch comedy #644. i've never heard so many viagra jokes in thirty seconds.
59043,Marge,"lisa, would you like a penny to throw at your brother?"
67242,Marge,"bart, if you had cleaned up your room when i asked you to, your father's trick back would still be aligned. so you pick up this mess right now."
59051,Marge,"wooh, wooh. look at those silk pillows. it's like the set of some high-class porno film!"
67244,Marge,well... okay.
67247,Marge,"homer, principal skinner's here."
67248,Marge,"oh, dear."
67252,Marge,"well, going to france sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but i think bart should have a say in this."
59063,Marge,thirty-three cents? i paid almost double that.
59070,Marge,"come on, homer, japan will be fun. you liked ""rashomon."""
59071,Marge,homer!
67266,Marge,homer!
59074,Marge,"bart, what are you doing?"
67268,Marge,"well, okay, i will. if you admit you love bart."
67270,Marge,oh... adil's a very sweet boy.
67278,Marge,"homer, i'd love a glass of that wine bart brought us."
67281,Marge,patty and selma are coming over to show us slides from their trip to the yucatan.
59093,Marge,"i know, but we didn't."
59094,Marge,perfect.
59103,Marge,"i liked it. it was nice to see a movie where people solved their problems with words, instead of bullets and chasing."
67296,Marge,ohhh.
59105,Marge,"um, will you be reading the cards yourself, mel?"
59108,Marge,"hollywood, here we come!"
59117,Marge,"oh sorry, honey, i used up the last roll on that man i thought was judge judy."
67310,Marge,this is marge simpson. i'd like a babysitter for the evening.
59119,Marge,you mean like john leguizamo?
67312,Marge,like an angel.
59121,Marge,i don't want to pump my little boy full of drugs.
59127,Marge,"yes, i just thought you might love me enough to let me help you."
67321,Marge,"oh, there it... went."
67323,Marge,don't muss my hair.
67324,Marge,wheeeee!
59135,Marge,can you believe it? and he's even tutoring a little navajo boy.
67328,Marge,"oh, homer."
67329,Marge,"homer, would it spoil the mood if i called home? you know, just to check on the kids?"
59137,Marge,i was thinking of something a little more... adult.
59139,Marge,i think you misheard me.
67336,Marge,"soup's on! hurry up, or it'll get that icky skin on the top."
67337,Marge,"in a second, homer. lisa has some good news."
67338,Marge,"homer! go ahead, lisa."
59144,Marge,o-kayyy.
59154,Marge,my sweet baby. he must feel so helpless and scared.
67349,Marge,wake up and look at the snow.
59157,Marge,how about getting out of the tank... huh maybe stopping your rampage? huh? we could go to krusty burger...
67353,Marge,"he's much happier at work and, well, just between us girls... well, he hasn't been this frisky in years."
67354,Marge,"homie, my sisters are here."
67355,Marge,"hello, homie. how's my big important executive?"
59161,Marge,"you know, homie, the ""e"" doesn't work on that typewriter."
59165,Marge,you like shake and bake. you used to put it in your coffee.
59167,Marge,"homie, my women's intuition's acting up. something bad's going to happen if you go in there."
59171,Marge,please be a dog.
59173,Marge,"oh my god, we killed ned flanders!"
67369,Marge,"come here. ""you are so beautiful to me / you are so beautiful to me / can't you see? / you're everything that i hoped for /"
67370,Marge,"hello, everyone. you know, halloween is a very strange holiday. personally, i don't understand it. kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... things on t.v. that are completely inappropriate for younger viewers. things like the following half hour. nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, which i totally wash my hands of, is really scary, so if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight, instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. thanks for your attention."
59179,Marge,someone saw us.
67373,Marge,it just seems too good to be true.
67375,Marge,hmmm. this kitchen certainly could use a woman's touch.
59184,Marge,"remember, you're vulnerable to kryptonite!"
67378,Marge,"children, get your coats. we're leaving this house right now."
59188,Marge,i don't want you looting!
67386,Marge,homer...
59195,Marge,"thanks, homer."
59196,Marge,homer...
67394,Marge,"well, thank you very much, mr....?"
59203,Marge,"we're fine, colonel. good day."
59208,Marge,i'll repress the rage i'm feeling.
59209,Marge,maybe it needs more fertilizer.
67405,Marge,"you're late for work, homer."
67411,Marge,absolutely not!
59222,Marge,"that's odd. the outside looks like a tomato, but the inside is brown."
67419,Marge,"lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt."
67420,Marge,"can i have your plate, mr. burns?"
59229,Marge,"give them the plant, homer!"
67422,Marge,"homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling, and sleeping till noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them."
67424,Marge,"well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire."
67426,Marge,"here you go, bart."
67427,Marge,homer... homer... x.y.z.
67428,Marge,all this means is you can't wave your fanny in public.
59234,Marge,homer!
59237,Marge,"okay, sure."
67436,Marge,"look, it's tony bennett!"
59244,Marge,"ohhh, homey, is that what's bothering you?"
59248,Marge,"excuse me, where are your hamper lids?"
59255,Marge,oh. sorry. so have you two thought about kids?
67448,Marge,"well, how did he say it?"
67449,Marge,was he angry?
67450,Marge,was he rude?
59258,Marge,you have octuplets. it rolls off your tongue and into your heart: octuplets.
67453,Marge,i think it's terrible. a man opens his heart and you make fun of him.
67458,Marge,you brought food...
59270,Marge,"it's not a real car, grampa."
67467,Marge,"ohhh, well, what won't make him logy?"
59275,Marge,"wow, a fifties nostalgia cafe!"
59280,Marge,"okay, meathook, i think he learned his lesson."
59281,Marge,"i think it's great you've chosen to ""crash"" here, but do you have to be so messy?"
67489,Marge,"oh, why don't i go talk to her?"
67490,Marge,"honey, your food is getting cold."
67494,Marge,"everyone, lisa wants to read us a poem she's written."
59302,Marge,talk to him. use your words.
67496,Marge,and i said he ruined thanksgiving...
59303,Marge,"oh, homie."
59304,Marge,"ohh, i just swept the circle of death!"
59307,Marge,goodbye everybody!
59308,Marge,why are we stopping here?
67502,Marge,"no, no, no! that won't do at all!"
67503,Marge,now we can blame him for everything.
59314,Marge,"why don't you kick some books, lisa?"
67510,Marge,homer.
59320,Marge,go! go!
59322,Marge,you guys never use any of this stuff.
67516,Marge,"oh, my little boy, ."
67518,Marge,"gee, i never realized tv was such a dangerous influence."
59332,Marge,skiing fanny-first into a crevasse isn't my idea of fun. the only risk i'm taking is running out of marshmallows!
67526,Marge,you don't have to go to all that trouble just for me.
59335,Marge,"sweetie, it's nice that you want to take charge around the house, but don't be a hero. just make sure your father eats all his meals over a tarp. but not the good tarp. i want you to get married on that some day!"
67530,Marge,"well, you won't be watching these cartoons anymore. ever."
59339,Marge,so it does.
59340,Marge,"oh, i don't think i need any... oh, wow..."
67534,Marge,homer! i'm trying to work!
59343,Marge,"oh, i don't know, honey. i've got a lot of therapy left."
67536,Marge,what kind of warped human being would find that funny?
67539,Marge,dear purveyors of senseless violence: i know this may sound silly at first...
59349,Marge,"okay, okay calm down. they couldn't have gone too far."
59352,Marge,"well, then let's get out of here."
67545,Marge,"well, i've never changed the world before, so i don't know how long it takes exactly. but if enough people take an interest..."
59353,Marge,"well, it all sounds lovely, but..."
59354,Marge,"there's a homecoming parade, a cocktail party..."
59355,Marge,you college boys are only interested in one thing.
67549,Marge,i've started a crusade against cartoon violence.
59359,Marge,"homer, maybe i should drive."
67553,Marge,have fun.
67554,Marge,and what happens when a child grows up with insanely violent role models like these?
59361,Marge,wow! he should have his foot insured by lloyds of london!
59362,Marge,he hit the star player!
67559,Marge,no one.
67562,Marge,when do we want it?
67563,Marge,what do we want?
59371,Marge,good lord! this bedroom is as big as our house!
67567,Marge,krusty
59375,Marge,"homer, watch your lang... oooooh. that's a lifesaver."
59378,Marge,"stop swirling, homer!"
67572,Marge,mmmmmmmph!
59384,Marge,"no partays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no mixers, no raves, no box socials..."
67578,Marge,hello?
59387,Marge,the boat's going sideways!
59388,Marge,"honey, we want mr. burns to find this place exactly the way he left it."
67581,Marge,well... what's the problem you're having?
67582,Marge,huh huh.
67584,Marge,well... let's see... oh! couldn't itchy share his pie with scratchy? then they would both have pie.
59393,Marge,"that is the best version of ""living in america"" i've ever heard."
59396,Marge,let's forget about the band contest and just have fun at the state fair.
67589,Marge,so what did you kids do today?
59397,Marge,"yeah, right, that's what i meant, lisa. state un-fair."
59399,Marge,i wish people would stop telling me to step right up.
67595,Marge,but i like that statue.
67600,Marge,david.
59410,Marge,"okay, lisa. i've got furious d across the board, boxed with the three and the eight, and wheeled up and down."
67603,Marge,"aw, well isn't that nice."
59411,Marge,president clinton?!
67608,Marge,hmmm.
67610,Marge,homer!
67613,Marge,i didn't know you liked animals.
59422,Marge,"you're darn right you are! and you've got lots of other great qualities, too."
67621,Marge,"i'm sorry, but my mother always said, ""if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."""
59438,Marge,guess who i saw at the supermarket today!
59443,Marge,you set off the smoke alarm to rush us to a beer festival?
67636,Marge,sure.
67639,Marge,"homer, i'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing."
59449,Marge,"well, i'm gonna keep watching as long as they have shocking story twists and endless pillow talk."
59450,Marge,who cares? he's dishin' out the dirt.
59453,Marge,not half as good as cyberfudge.
59456,Marge,"be nice to your brother, lisa."
59457,Marge,don't you think we should wait for lisa? she is the president.
67653,Marge,"well, have you decided what you want to do tomorrow?"
59463,Marge,gold bars discovered by homer?
67657,Marge,because sometimes it's fun to dress up for dinner.
59468,Marge,"homer, you can't just reroute the gas line. do you know how dangerous that is?"
67661,Marge,"oh, where can he be?"
67663,Marge,"i wrote a poem for you this afternoon, homer. it's called, ""to a husband."""
67666,Marge,homer? homer?
59474,Marge,"yes, go! just go!"
59475,Marge,so how was your ride with barney?
67669,Marge,wake up! you're alive! you're alive!
67670,Marge,you're alive!
59486,Marge,"well, maybe you added it wrong. let me add it..."
67686,Marge,"well, no i don't. actually, i never really..."
59494,Marge,this is terrible. the whole point of coming down here was for you to get some rest.
67688,Marge,i'm a political prisoner. last time i ever take a stand.
59499,Marge,"oh, thank goodness. where were you?"
67692,Marge,hello.
67698,Marge,and the city forensics championship is coming up.
59508,Marge,"ohhh, it's so cozy."
59509,Marge,"can i top you off, hon?"
67703,Marge,"well, not me. shut it off and let's get down to business."
67706,Marge,"tres bien. well, i should probably be going. i have a big forensics meet tomorrow."
59514,Marge,"you know, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
67714,Marge,"you knew the city forensics finals are tomorrow. and you kept me here until one a.m. pretending to be stupid. homer j. simpson, i hate you!"
59522,Marge,"well, we're still welcome in north dakota and arizona."
59529,Marge,"fine, you win. i'll do your shopping for you."
67729,Marge,"take me home, artie."
59538,Marge,"ah, little vicki, i really think she had her heart set on..."
59547,Marge,awww...
59551,Marge,"see, honey? all you needed was to believe in..."
67744,Marge,what's gotten into lisa?
67748,Marge,"just charge me something, please."
67749,Marge,"well, you know, bart was looking at that racy movie today, and lisa's losing a little respect for you... maybe we should think about unhooking the cable."
67750,Marge,"well, then maybe you should pay for it."
59561,Marge,"well, the real key, according to sexperts, is mutual interests."
67756,Marge,"thank you, barney. how many people are coming, homer?"
67759,Marge,"here you go, homie."
67765,Marge,well... i'll try.
67766,Marge,"homer? do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the bowler's hall of fame in st. louis, missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin?"
67767,Marge,then you'll also remember that you owe me a favor...
59577,Marge,"that's very impressive, but i still don't... stop that!"
59578,Marge,hello. hel-looo.
59580,Marge,it's red!
67773,Marge,"homer, you will find her a man."
59583,Marge,really?
67776,Marge,he's here.
59584,Marge,dead in a week? what are you talking about?
59586,Marge,becky's going to seduce homer?
59590,Marge,"oh, no. the ""brakes cut"" light."
59593,Marge,"look, i know i don't have any proof, but this woman is trying to kill me!"
59595,Marge,usurper! usurper! usurper!
67788,Marge,"oh for god's sakes, homer, it's an empty threat."
67790,Marge,thank you.
67792,Marge,"homer, please."
59606,Marge,"now, let's find out who this becky really is."
67799,Marge,"bye, herb."
67800,Marge,maybe he just said that to make conversation.
67801,Marge,"time to get up, lisa. it's a school day!"
59613,Marge,"ooboy, my bad. becky, i'm so sorry i accused you of trying to kill me and steal my family."
59618,Marge,nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids. they almost drove me to fortified wine!
59619,Marge,"""the malarkeys,"" ""dumbin' it down""..."
59620,Marge,"homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show. finally, i said, ""so, do it! either shit or get off the pot."""
67813,Marge,"oh yes, you do. you just don't know it. the memory of a million drop-stitches flows in your veins."
67814,Marge,you try it.
59633,Marge,stop it!
59634,Marge,i shot the sheriff / but i did not shoot the dep-u-ty
67827,Marge,i don't know.
67828,Marge,hm.
59637,Marge,"good night, laughlin!"
59639,Marge,"you just don't say no to the redheaded stranger. and when i heard it was for awareness, that sealed the deal."
59640,Marge,... which homer writes himself.
59641,Marge,i can't believe it. we won another contest!
59643,Marge,"why don't you read ""cathy""? she's hilarious."
59644,Marge,what?!
67837,Marge,aww.
67840,Marge,"homer, that's terrible. we should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly. you know, we'll be old someday."
59651,Marge,"well, i've got a whole list of chores: clean the garage, paint the house, grout the tu--"
67847,Marge,"homer, this thing with your dad has had you moping around the house for days. i think it's time for you to talk to someone who understands."
67849,Marge,"no, maggie! stay in the shallow end."
59661,Marge,"the phone company ran out of numbers, so they split the city into two area codes. half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939."
59665,Marge,out-of-towner tax?!
67860,Marge,no.
59669,Marge,they were looking at me. with their eyes.
67863,Marge,"oh, lisa, this was a bad idea."
59674,Marge,my experiment? you're the one who came up with this whole idea...
67872,Marge,mr. burns. would you like to come in?
59683,Marge,"well, let me know when you get back to horror."
59684,Marge,and you'll lose weight?
59687,Marge,"oh, krusty. i'm sure she just needs time to get used to you."
59688,Marge,"sure, go ahead."
67883,Marge,"mr. burns, it's hard to discover your inner beauty while you're shouting at an eight-year-old girl."
67886,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?!"
59694,Marge,"bart, it's so sweet of you to take the family out to krustyburger."
59696,Marge,i can't believe how young he is. he'd be cute if he weren't so idealistic.
59697,Marge,"yeah, that was the boy lisa likes."
59698,Marge,they've undergone terrible hardships.
67892,Marge,"okay, homer. if you think i can."
67901,Marge,"homer, i've been talking to lisa and i'm concerned about your relationship with her."
59712,Marge,"hmm. well, i'm proud of you. you're such a good provider. kids, come on -- thank your father for the injections!"
67905,Marge,sure.
67906,Marge,no.
59715,Marge,what's going on?
67913,Marge,"and this dialogue has none of the wit and sparkle of ""murphy brown."""
67917,Marge,i am glad he's gone.
59727,Marge,"once you get used to the druggings, this isn't a bad place."
59738,Marge,ohhhh.
67931,Marge,this is really annoying.
59739,Marge,you talk too much. abra-ca-blab-ra! am i right?
59743,Marge,get 'em off me! get 'em off! get 'em off!
59745,Marge,but where did it come from?
59748,Marge,there you are. how was the magic act?
67941,Marge,"bart, are you drinking?!"
67945,Marge,"thank you, bart -- this frame grab's going on my coffee cup."
67949,Marge,as best you could.
59758,Marge,they always say they're innocent. it's such a turn-off.
67952,Marge,coming right up. mind if i turn on a little music?
67954,Marge,hold that thought.
59767,Marge,watching those women is giving me ideas...
59768,Marge,"it's hauntingly beautiful, isn't it?"
59769,Marge,"oh, stop. your father and i don't get the day off."
59770,Marge,lenny says we've got the day off! yippee!
59774,Marge,"well, maybe if you ate some meat you'd have a natural lubricant! you lost all our money?"
59778,Marge,really?
59785,Marge,"c'mon. you and the kids always wanna do fun stuff, but today we're doing something i like."
59787,Marge,"no, ""smapron."""
59803,Marge,"oh, homie. i knew you'd support me."
59809,Marge,question?
59810,Marge,"why, thank you, jack."
59823,Marge,"warden, please. this man is a gentle soul. i know he's made mistakes, but someone with his talent belongs on a boardwalk doing caricatures. not behind bars."
59824,Marge,"honestly, it wouldn't bother me."
59826,Marge,i hope this is okay. it's not very prison-y.
59827,Marge,"uh, mecca? well, let's..."
59849,Marge,you crumb-bum. you looked me right in the eye and lied to me.
59853,Marge,i don't know. it came with the house.
59855,Marge,so many restaurants...
59856,Marge,"umm... i guess i'll, i'll have the chicken tandoori."
59858,Marge,stop that! and get ready! we're going to the old folks' talent show. now get washed up.
59863,Marge,even bonnets?
59865,Marge,as far as i know.
59870,Marge,"ooh. maggie, are your ears burning?"
59875,Marge,"no, it's a smooth motion... you follow through with your racket."
59880,Marge,"uh, there's something i should tell you."
59889,Marge,lisa!
59902,Marge,"well, i think it's good for a show to go off the air before it becomes stale and repetitive."
59910,Marge,thank you so much for saving our son from that murderous mob.
59913,Marge,"oh, okay."
59917,Marge,nobody's going home. we're going to see bart's concert.
59920,Marge,don't you mean blocko shirt?
59923,Marge,i'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
59925,Marge,"oh, homie, i love them. i can't thank you enough."
59940,Marge,"not now, lisa."
59941,Marge,"chew, chew, chew! swallow, swallow, swallow!"
59947,Marge,"yep. it's great to have some time just to ourselves, huh?"
59949,Marge,i got it!
59950,Marge,"no, i got it!"
59952,Marge,"homer! don't be... wow, that is huge."
59956,Marge,she's not afraid of bunnies.
59957,Marge,"no, no, no. oh, homie!"
59971,Marge,"hey, the dog smells something!"
59982,Marge,"oh, thank you. your ground is so comfortable."
59983,Marge,"bart, i told you not to get your lip disked."
59990,Marge,a chimp!
59994,Marge,i-i love what you've done with these poles.
59995,Marge,ho-mer.
59997,Marge,"don't worry, doctor. we'll get you all the help you need."
60000,Marge,what happened to president muntu?
60001,Marge,breakfast!
60003,Marge,"they also make ""juice-lix."""
60009,Marge,i'm sorry! i'm so sorry!
60015,Marge,"arrest me?! um, my address, it's, um... 1-2-3... fake street."
60016,Marge,"we've gotta get to the hospital, homer!"
60017,Marge,let's just say that bart did it.
60035,Marge,you leave those boys alone!
60040,Marge,"rachel jordan? isn't that the woman you had a crush on, ned?"
60041,Marge,"oh, don't you worry. we'll make all the hard decisions so you don't have to."
60044,Marge,"wow, three pairs of shoes. someone had a fetish."
60048,Marge,it's a miracle!
60050,Marge,one more and i get a free hysterectomy.
60053,Marge,"you shoo, barney gumbel!"
60057,Marge,"homer, this man is from the ""good guy"" awards."
60060,Marge,i can't believe it. we won another contest!
60067,Marge,soon. i just need a few more yoga classes.
60074,Marge,"grampa, we've been married for years. when are you gonna put down that gun?"
60076,Marge,would you like to come sightseeing with us?
60081,Marge,no! goodnight. seesh.
60084,Marge,"homer, catching that leprechaun didn't help anything."
60085,Marge,the best thing about a gypsy wedding is i'm not the hairiest woman here.
60092,Marge,murder-suicides.
60095,Marge,"well, hello pierce!"
60103,Marge,"oh, pierce. the water's perfect."
60104,Marge,"oh, you don't have to do..."
60105,Marge,"ohhh... ohhh... oh, pierce, that's gooood..."
60111,Marge,"oh, this seems like such a waste. i mean, he was charming and witty."
60120,Marge,i can't take it anymore!
60123,Marge,"homer, just take him to the bathroom."
60125,Marge,i don't want him to see us expressing our love.
60132,Marge,"no, i won't. and frankly, judge, i think you're a bully."
60139,Marge,"i want goggles, too."
60145,Marge,let's do this thing.
60148,Marge,and help me with this banner.
60149,Marge,let's get out of here.
60152,Marge,"homer, no!"
60157,Marge,there's no drugs out there.
60158,Marge,"bart, this is dr. kaufman. he's a special kind of ""talking doctor."""
60165,Marge,every house has a bathroom.
60171,Marge,that was amazing. i hope the kids didn't hear us.
60174,Marge,putting away groceries -- it's like unwrapping presents from yourself. fruit roll-ups for bart... beer roll-ups for homer...
60178,Marge,look at that absorbativity! i've gotta tell someone...
60179,Marge,watch what happens when i spill this blue liquid.
60210,Marge,maybe we should come back in the daytime.
60212,Marge,"water, eh?"
60216,Marge,"lisa, don't sulk. you're on the jumbotron."
60224,Marge,this is the worst thing you've ever done.
60226,Marge,let's just write to david bowie again.
60228,Marge,where's bart?
60241,Marge,she's not a devil. i just don't know what to do.
60245,Marge,"i was just making christmas cookies. but since you don't believe in christmas anymore, i guess you don't want any."
60261,Marge,"happy, happy new year!"
60265,Marge,how can an iron be a landlord?
60269,Marge,this family has hit rock bottom.
60272,Marge,"we've got to do something, but what?"
60273,Marge,"my driving ankle! bart, i know this sounds crazy, but do you think you can drive the car?"
60275,Marge,"you know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger."
60283,Marge,bigamy.
60286,Marge,our plan worked perfectly.
60287,Marge,"i'm so proud of us. when we stick together, we can do anything."
60293,Marge,"ow, my hairstyle!"
60294,Marge,i can't believe it. everyone's celebrating their obesity!
60296,Marge,"you kids do eat a lot of sugar. but at least homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit."
60299,Marge,oh.
60300,Marge,"apu, everything in this store is overloaded with sugar."
60303,Marge,"i want you to stop putting so much sugar in everything, or at least warn people that it's so unhealthy."
60305,Marge,hey!
60310,Marge,"that company's ruining the whole town's health, and i don't know how to stop them."
60312,Marge,i'm not sure i can afford a fancy lawyer.
60321,Marge,who is this?
60332,Marge,"oh honey, think pink. look, a salute to safe sex!"
60336,Marge,so your life is ruined.
60338,Marge,"stop it, homer!"
60339,Marge,i am not gonna make you another sparerib smoothie. most people with their jaws wired shut don't gain weight.
60349,Marge,a formal. the one place you can wear a tiara and not look crazy.
60352,Marge,this has been one of the most magical evenings of my life.
60354,Marge,"well, he would eat all the time. we'd be making love, and he'd have a mouth full of hershey's miniatures."
60356,Marge,he did such crazy things -- roll clip.
60378,Marge,i'll get it!
60379,Marge,nooky in new york?
60386,Marge,"well, i think you should get in touch with him. you know, just to congratulate him on his success."
60387,Marge,"well, i suppose i could write him a letter..."
60394,Marge,for you. for you.
60403,Marge,"besides, i like some of the noises you make in bed."
60408,Marge,"hello, artie."
60412,Marge,"get off me, you little... nerd!"
60418,Marge,but i can explain!
60434,Marge,i make mine with m&ms.
60442,Marge,"hurry up, bart, or you'll be late to be killed by the dog."
60445,Marge,i guess you're not going to have an adventure this week.
60447,Marge,"aw, homie, you'll always be my western hero."
60453,Marge,you care about bart's feelings.
60457,Marge,"well, i don't know. i just naturally assumed it was some of my business."
60462,Marge,hello?
60466,Marge,the home told us you were dead.
60468,Marge,"all right, grampa. i'll help you get your license back."
60479,Marge,betcha they're not! three to one. how much you got?
60482,Marge,"homer, you got a letter. hm. it's from the library."
60500,Marge,sit down.
60502,Marge,"wow, everything is so high-tech."
60505,Marge,homer! they must have made a mistake. we'll just go down to the phone company and straighten it out.
60509,Marge,oh.
60514,Marge,that's it. we're just going to have to pay for that call to brazil.
60516,Marge,why did you do it?
60522,Marge,"well done bart, but in brazil they speak portuguese."
60525,Marge,"bart, what are you watching?"
60532,Marge,"aw, look at all the stuffed coatimundi."
60537,Marge,that's baby corn.
60541,Marge,"i've tried heckling them, i've tried jeckling them, it's time i made myself a scarecrow."
60542,Marge,go away! go away!
60557,Marge,"good night, homer."
60562,Marge,"or, or, um, with, with a funny hat on."
60571,Marge,"if you ask me, you should give up fatty foods."
60576,Marge,you mean i shouldn't punish bart at all?
60591,Marge,"kids, we want to talk to you about something."
60595,Marge,"manjula, we've got a special guest for you."
60623,Marge,"darn her socks?... i say, darn her! i'll do them and then i'm outta here."
60627,Marge,"oh my gosh, she's dead."
60630,Marge,"oh dear, now everyone will think homer and i did it. the real killer is the man with the braces."
60643,Marge,i'll always love you.
60644,Marge,it's the man with the braces!
60654,Marge,"oh, forget it. they couldn't catch a cold with a... a, a cold-catching thing."
60655,Marge,"you said you'd do something, and you followed through on it."
60664,Marge,"fat tony, how can you do this?"
60666,Marge,somebody does care!
60670,Marge,hm. time to check in on our little sweetie pie.
60672,Marge,"but this is your chance to contact your late wife, maude."
60677,Marge,"what do you think, homer? does this make my hips look big?"
60682,Marge,aww.
60683,Marge,"they look like you, they were rude to patty and selma, and the horde has been described as ""very gassy."""
60685,Marge,"the horde is almost dead! there's still some writhing and twitching, but that should stop by morning."
60692,Marge,"homer, someone's in trouble!"
60698,Marge,simpson.
60700,Marge,it's true. i couldn't even wake you up for work this morning. i had to tell mr. burns you had violent diarrhea.
60703,Marge,"oh, you big fooler. pretending not to remember so you could surprise us."
60708,Marge,a place where you'll never be bothered by your family again.
60709,Marge,"get out of the car, homer."
60718,Marge,"why is he performing the duties of a roadie? am i saying that right, ""roadie?"""
60728,Marge,"hello, principal skinner."
60730,Marge,my poor babies!
60740,Marge,"manjula, remember when apu cheated on you?"
60745,Marge,"doctor, before we begin, i have a couple questions."
60747,Marge,"that's funny. hm, i don't feel sucked out."
60752,Marge,"oh, sweetie."
60753,Marge,/ oh.
60761,Marge,"now wait, homer."
60763,Marge,"keep in mind, they're only temporaries."
60764,Marge,"homer, how come you never sang a song like that to me before?"
60770,Marge,"kiki, i'm tired of trade show modeling. my back really hurts."
60771,Marge,did you just drug me?
60778,Marge,"anyway, you're the only man i want ogling me."
60788,Marge,so... when can we go back in our house?
60790,Marge,"wow, lenny. your apartment is stunning."
60791,Marge,thanks for letting us stay with you.
60797,Marge,my hair isn't really blue.
60799,Marge,it takes six hours to make breakfast now.
60805,Marge,no!
60814,Marge,"oh, it sure is good to be home."
60826,Marge,paris?
60828,Marge,i don't think this was a great place to bring the children.
60836,Marge,but i'm afraid you'll get hurt.
60839,Marge,"hey, they have latin grammys."
60845,Marge,"and he's good around the potty, too."
60849,Marge,"chief wiggum, my daughter is innocent until proven guilty."
60853,Marge,"uh, ""a."" and i'd like to add that proposition ""hug lisa for me"" has my full support."
60854,Marge,but there's no room for you.
60867,Marge,let's go home. there's nothing dangerous there except for the electrical wiring.
60868,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry. i'll come right out and help you."
60870,Marge,"sorry, i can't go outside. i'll call for help."
60871,Marge,"oh, my god. isn't there anything i can do?"
60876,Marge,eight...
60878,Marge,"ten, ten, ten, ten..."
60893,Marge,i'm not afraid!
60894,Marge,"ned, i'm not afraid!"
60897,Marge,not any more!
60901,Marge,i don't have those kind of muscles.
60902,Marge,steroids!?
60903,Marge,i can't take drugs -- i have so many anti-drug bumper stickers. i'd be making a liar out of my tailgate.
60906,Marge,i feel good... with no repercussions!
60910,Marge,"bye, kids! bye, bye!"
60913,Marge,i wasn't asking.
60924,Marge,"bart, you're a little young to be growling at seven foot chinese ladies."
60938,Marge,are you sure? because it really spoke to me.
60941,Marge,"homer aren't you afraid you might be, i don't know, incurring god's wrath?"
60950,Marge,"your father invested it in a college trust fund, which today must be worth a..."
60953,Marge,"bart, stop that!"
60957,Marge,i wanted a sewing room. but not like this. not like this!
60963,Marge,i think he might come home if we can show him we can treat him better.
60965,Marge,here's five dollars. buy yourself a suit and get busy.
60969,Marge,"school's starting, bart. aren't you excited? this year you learn about local history!"
60970,Marge,"ooh, a new hamburger sandwich."
60972,Marge,"i'm just happy you're excited about something besides saving the whales. face it, they're doomed!"
60975,Marge,"well, why don't we celebrate by going to a movie?"
60977,Marge,"really? hmm. well what about in the sentence ""jim nabors is way cool""?"
60980,Marge,he's adorable! i'd sure like to tuck that in at night.
60987,Marge,hold your horses. i was up all night fishing out the drawstring from your father's swimsuit.
60989,Marge,"well, it ain't happening today."
60991,Marge,poor ned. this is his first jellyfish festival alone.
60996,Marge,"today's book is ""bridget jones' diary."" now, let's go around the room and analyze why we didn't read it."
61014,Marge,"...the shaking's so bad, all my omelets have become frittatas."
61015,Marge,quick! someone perform cpr.
61020,Marge,"krusty, we're desperate here. we need you to turn your campaign around."
61025,Marge,"no, let's hear him out. he looks a little like walter mondale."
61026,Marge,but i didn't do anything.
61028,Marge,"homie, i'm sorry... you know i usually bring my a-game to the bedroom... but tonight i just can't throw the heat."
61035,Marge,so my husband goes to a bar every night. whoop de doo. who gives a bibble? gabba gabba hey!
61040,Marge,homie?
61041,Marge,uh-oh -- sounds like some bad eggs are cooking up trouble.
61055,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
61062,Marge,you made your own breakfast?
61065,Marge,"well, there are a lot of beer cans around here."
61069,Marge,"don't worry, sweetie. your father won't stay mad forever."
61075,Marge,"homie, i tried to tell you how i feel, but i can't find the right words. maybe he can."
61079,Marge,and i still do.
61081,Marge,"homie, what are you thinking?"
61084,Marge,i am so sick of that song!
61087,Marge,"watch it, mr. byrne! you'll slip on the simonize!"
61100,Marge,you're tellin' me.
61108,Marge,"homie, get out of that treehouse!"
61112,Marge,"well, he's not yours anymore. you threw him out on christmas eve!"
61116,Marge,all we have left are the earthquake ham and the condolence ham.
61118,Marge,he woke you up when you stopped breathing last night.
61121,Marge,"bart, get out of there!"
61122,Marge,my poor boy. will he be all right?
61124,Marge,"well, it's eleven a.m. on a workday, so he must be at that stupid bar."
61129,Marge,why can't you use the local dry cleaner?
61132,Marge,we don't have time for choking!
61133,Marge,"i'm stressed because now that you've lost your license, i'm a full-time family chauffeur!"
61135,Marge,how could you both miss the bus to school?
61147,Marge,what? that's crazy.
61148,Marge,"that's ridiculous. i don't like you. i mean hate you, hate you, hate you! i hate you!"
61149,Marge,maybe we should see a counselor.
61151,Marge,i'm really touched by how much you care.
61156,Marge,"oh homie, you got everyone in springfield here for me!"
61158,Marge,"ooo, the pretender!"
61165,Marge,"ned, i am so sorry."
61178,Marge,what are we gonna do to that field?
61185,Marge,well you ain't seen nothin' till you've seen the pre-teen braves.
61187,Marge,this is a perfect opportunity. we'll beat those cavalry kids by selling candy!
61188,Marge,all i wanted was to glue feathers on felt and teach the boys good citizenship. and now it's a donnybrook!
61205,Marge,"no, it's your turn."
61207,Marge,"now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender."
61209,Marge,no! we have to find my baby!
61213,Marge,all the time. sometimes i bring them lemonade.
61214,Marge,maggie's right in the middle of that italian-american-mexican standoff!
61217,Marge,will everyone please stop fighting and burning!
61222,Marge,"thanks for not killing me, homie. here's an extra pork chop."
61225,Marge,"lisa, that's a filthy habit."
61231,Marge,my heart is fine.
61240,Marge,"okay, homie. if it makes you feel better, i think your mom's all right, too."
61245,Marge,"honey, you could be popular, you've just got to be yourself... in a whole new way."
61247,Marge,"you're like geraldine ferraro, except you won, where she failed miserably."
61252,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing? this is the kind of troublemaking i expect from your brother."
61258,Marge,well... someday i'd like to go on a nice vacation.
61260,Marge,"oh, forget it. bart, don't waste your money on me."
61262,Marge,that sounds great -- but only if your father promises to behave.
61267,Marge,"homie, i don't think we'll be able to find the kids from up here."
61270,Marge,"homie, you're doing a great job driving on the left. this is turning out to be our most enjoyable trip ever."
61278,Marge,"that was very sweet of the queen, letting you go in exchange for taking madonna back to america."
61285,Marge,but seeing you like this is more than i can bear.
61288,Marge,"now look here, mister. i forbid you to fight a bear."
61290,Marge,"lisa, i think your father just left!"
61294,Marge,is there any sign of my husband?
61295,Marge,"it's homer, don't shoot!"
61300,Marge,dr. hibbert? is someone seriously ill?
61304,Marge,"how about jon stewart? he's a son, a lover and a pundit rolled into one sexy package."
61309,Marge,yes.
61312,Marge,"that's a very violent image, lisa."
61318,Marge,"homer, is there something you're not telling us?"
61320,Marge,you wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself!
61322,Marge,you can sleep on the couch tonight.
61324,Marge,that last one looked kinda good.
61328,Marge,"homie, i'm so proud -- you changed more than i could imagined! you're even covering your mouth when you burp."
61336,Marge,i got the roofi tickets!
61339,Marge,this concert is oversold. it's as if a music promoter acted unscrupulously!
61350,Marge,her name is lisa. and i wouldn't trade her for all the sleep-in sundays and speed dating in the world.
61355,Marge,we've got pretzels at home.
61359,Marge,save our families! sign our petition!
61365,Marge,that wasn't me!
61370,Marge,what are you going to do?
61372,Marge,i probably should have watched it first.
61378,Marge,i said no!
61387,Marge,"my job was to keep lisa's hope alive. but instead, she's really depressed."
61394,Marge,you work at the nuclear plant.
61395,Marge,tonight? but i was hoping you could watch the kids while i work on my novel.
61401,Marge,that painting has always sparked my imagination.
61402,Marge,that's it. a novel about whaling -- that's something you haven't seen before. thank you...
61403,Marge,scene from moby-dick.
61411,Marge,fine. right after this revision!
61413,Marge,...she had married a brute.
61416,Marge,"boy, when you write you can let your imagination run wild. ""temperance was doing the laundry..."""
61424,Marge,it's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.
61425,Marge,it's double-spaced.
61426,Marge,well?
61449,Marge,...sent lewis and clark and some embedded journalists to find the northwest passage.
61450,Marge,they paddled up the mississippi from st. louis...
61451,Marge,"when winter came, lewis and clark tried to set up camp, but encountered much hardship."
61459,Marge,and that's the life of mozart. thank god he died young. i've gotta get dinner on the stove.
61462,Marge,"well, i'm sure he'll be happy you came."
61468,Marge,are these diamondique?
61469,Marge,diamondelle?
61470,Marge,cubic diamondium?
61471,Marge,dioxy-ribo-diamondoid?
61474,Marge,hostess twinkies?
61475,Marge,kids?
61476,Marge,"go ride bikes for a while, huh."
61481,Marge,"and to remind you of what you've done, i'm going to keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions."
61482,Marge,"well, then maybe you need to buy me a brooch."
61483,Marge,what's all that racket?!
61490,Marge,"and even then, he could only speak german!"
61492,Marge,"maggie, i can't believe how much stuff your new school sent over!"
61504,Marge,but she's only eight!
61507,Marge,where'd you find these?
61510,Marge,"oh god, we're in a belly. everyone take off your shoes."
61527,Marge,"i don't know, artie..."
61536,Marge,daddy's not on fire.
61550,Marge,"homie, to store the extra wine we bought, i made a little wine cellar."
61552,Marge,"homie, you are so cute."
61560,Marge,maybe we should put this booze cruise in dry dock for a while.
61562,Marge,i hope i can still have fun while everyone else is drinking.
61566,Marge,"eh, why do people worry about stuff?... it's all gonna work out."
61572,Marge,i'm not a drunk!
61576,Marge,get away from me!
61578,Marge,you let me believe that i'd done such a terrible thing?
61579,Marge,i can't believe you did that to me.
61582,Marge,"well, i feel a buzz, but i don't feel happier. it's not like when i was drinking with homer."
61586,Marge,"thanks for everything, kyle."
61593,Marge,no.
61599,Marge,my baby boy is in jail! i'm the worst mom in the world.
61601,Marge,but he won't know where to go or what to eat.
61604,Marge,would you like to join us?
61605,Marge,"homie, what are you doing?"
61614,Marge,this is so sad.
61616,Marge,"so, how are you holdin' up?"
61626,Marge,i wish you'd devote this much time and attention to our relationship.
61632,Marge,where's that coming from?
61633,Marge,a band in a closet! every girl's dream.
61640,Marge,"all right, kids, you don't have to go. but i insist we do something tonight as a family. we'll play board games, put photos in an album, measure how much you've grown..."
61646,Marge,"homie, if i died, would you be sad?"
61648,Marge,"bart, stop fooling with the remote!"
61651,Marge,it's their hub.
61653,Marge,"honeymooners -- no kids, no worries."
61668,Marge,the kids tracked us down! our romantic holiday just became a stinkin' family vacation.
61669,Marge,"you're right, but where do we go?"
61670,Marge,step on it!
61674,Marge,"homie, the waiter's still here."
61679,Marge,we understand perfectly well!
61689,Marge,"ooh, i'll bet he's ned flanders."
61694,Marge,"oh, me too..."
61699,Marge,"i know one person who believes you were the pie man, homie... me. i've known it all along."
61703,Marge,"stop it, homer! there's only one way to settle this -- in simpson family court."
61706,Marge,"homer, that girl was me!"
61709,Marge,"i'll start from the beginning. the girls' camp was focused on teaching etiquette and deportment. now that i've captured your interest, let me continue..."
61716,Marge,it was as satisfying as a million hallmark cards with all the right-sized envelopes.
61717,Marge,but then your father showed his true colors.
61720,Marge,i guess so.
61723,Marge,"no, homer."
61730,Marge,but now it can have a second meaning.
61731,Marge,"oh, elvis."
61742,Marge,"well, america's not perfect--"
61744,Marge,i'll have you know i am very well liked in springfield.
61746,Marge,uh oh. poonam and uma are fighting!
61747,Marge,i can't believe they put us in jail.
61752,Marge,"homer, we've got to get outta here."
61754,Marge,wait right here for our encore...
61767,Marge,hello? octopuses? i'm done.
61773,Marge,why is my swimsuit so revealing?
61779,Marge,"although i must admit, they know where to stop."
61780,Marge,don't worry. we'll be fine!
61783,Marge,simpson.
61785,Marge,"it's so beautiful and modern. ooh, a sub-zero fridge..."
61796,Marge,"okay, here's your precious articles."
61797,Marge,i think you used too much plaster.
61799,Marge,i'm calling a contractor.
61805,Marge,"bart, can you come in here for a second?"
61808,Marge,i hope the ovenfresh bake-off likes them as much as you do.
61816,Marge,she is not!
61819,Marge,you did it on purpose?
61828,Marge,"don't worry, there's plenty for all of you! now who's laughing? huh? huh? me! i'm laughing!"
61832,Marge,"look, i'll be a winner with feet of clay... like mickey mantle. everyone loves the mick."
61833,Marge,"hey, plenty of kids are gonna look up to me when i'm auntie whatever it is. right now people just know me as the wife of the guy who doesn't go to work. can't you understand that i need this?"
61838,Marge,that's clever... and devastating. stop the competition!
61840,Marge,"thanks, honey, for saving me from myself."
61846,Marge,"aunt patty, aunt selma, grandma bouvier and grampa!"
61849,Marge,he's got the measles. but we've got him on speakerphone!
61856,Marge,"no! no, i've got a lot more mothering left in me!"
61857,Marge,"i'll be right here at three to pick you up, then i'll take you to the zoo! we can eat fries out of a safari hat!"
61861,Marge,aren't you the boy who beats up my son?
61862,Marge,those tadpoles are your lunch?
61864,Marge,you don't have to impress me by making fun of others. i already like you.
61879,Marge,"go home to your son, mrs. muntz. and try not to have intercourse on the way!"
61891,Marge,perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese.
61900,Marge,"well, it is good to see you, chloe. would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow?"
61903,Marge,"the excitement never stops. chloe, would you like to see slides of our trip to athens... boulevard recreational center?"
61904,Marge,i guess.
61912,Marge,together we broke the biggest story of the semester -- one of the cafeteria workers was spitting in the soup.
61914,Marge,"well, we both faced a tough decision...go off to journalism school, or stay in springfield with our sweethearts?"
61924,Marge,"not that you care about the ups and downs of my appliances. do ya? huh, do ya?"
61934,Marge,she's taken my daughter to an erupting volcano? that's it! she is off the christmas card list.
61937,Marge,"i'll save you, lisa! whoa."
61939,Marge,nothing's more powerful than a mother's love.
61940,Marge,don't worry. we've got two hours before it burns down to my head.
61944,Marge,lousy drawer... potato masher stuck in small spoon slot... what kind of madman would do that?
61949,Marge,let me wash it off.
61955,Marge,i can't believe mr. burns reserved the entire museum just for an office party.
61957,Marge,i've got a bad feeling about all of this.
61959,Marge,"now that mr. burns has eliminated the drug plan, we're gonna have to cut back on our diseases."
61966,Marge,"homer, those kookoo-birds at the bank goofed up and sent us a mortgage statement."
61980,Marge,"well, i was thinking more like drapes and a paint job, but your idea's good too."
61981,Marge,"thanks, moe."
61991,Marge,"homer, can you hold my wedding ring for a second? my finger's itchy."
61993,Marge,"homie, i'm tired. i have to get up early to catch my flight."
61996,Marge,"moe, your upper lip is trembling."
61998,Marge,i don't know what to say.
62000,Marge,homer! how'd you get in here?
62001,Marge,he's right.
62002,Marge,moe! no i don't love you. and i'm certainly not going to leave my husband.
62011,Marge,who's watching the kids?
62014,Marge,i said stop
62015,Marge,i agree. hey! aren't you that crazy cat lady?
62019,Marge,"everyone seemed so happy, but i'm surprised at ned. he left out all the good times cain and abel had when they were growing up."
62034,Marge,baggy britches? loose-laced gym shoes? are you going to a rap performance?
62038,Marge,"don't argue with marge, i know what's best / the only rap in this crib, keeps sandwiches fresh!"
62040,Marge,that little sneak disobeyed us and went to that hip-hop festival!
62045,Marge,homer!
62061,Marge,so patty. you're a woman who likes women. i guess that fear i always had of you stealing homer away is unfounded.
62062,Marge,"well, i guess i could have seen the signs."
62063,Marge,"oh no. oh no. why would it be? i love you and i love gay marriage, so i'd be a super-hypocrite if i didn't love your gay marriage. right?"
62065,Marge,actually your aunt is marrying a very lucky... woman.
62073,Marge,but that wouldn't happen unless...
62080,Marge,"lisa, you took out a restraining order against your own brother?"
62082,Marge,"please lift this restraining order, judge harm. it's poking our family apart."
62089,Marge,"selma, i never realized you wanted a child so badly."
62090,Marge,"don't cry, sweetie. everything's gonna be all right."
62134,Marge,did you spend our savings on a motor home?
62137,Marge,i melted string cheese over some corn chips!
62143,Marge,i know another place you can go -- to sleep!
62147,Marge,"well, you're not perfect either!"
62148,Marge,you hide food in my hair... you think brushing your teeth is foreplay...
62154,Marge,"oh my god, there they are!"
62155,Marge,"oh, i've lost them! i can't see past all the suvs!"
62158,Marge,"oh, come here!"
62161,Marge,"three hundred cans of budget club mushroom soup! if you have some noodles and tuna fish, you could make a casserole that's small on price, but big on flavor."
62162,Marge,"well, if he thinks he's getting a corner piece, forget it."
62166,Marge,"you know, we should visit shelbyville more often. they have a store that just sells shoes. i feel like i'm in paris!"
62169,Marge,those shelbyvillians are maligning us all. i've never heard such mean-spirited hate-hoots.
62170,Marge,why do you come to these meetings?
62179,Marge,"ooh, a tiffany's box! and the thing inside is from tiffany's! homie, you've never done this before. how'd you afford it?"
62183,Marge,as president of the cultural board i was given a key to the concert hall.
62185,Marge,i want you to look into the faces of those poor men -- each one is a life you made worse with your ratting.
62188,Marge,"kids, come down for your prom photo!"
62198,Marge,the one what?
62205,Marge,homer! i woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me.
62206,Marge,it means you have to fix the roof!
62221,Marge,you're not married to ray!
62225,Marge,"we better get you home. come on, lisa."
62227,Marge,"how you feeling, sweetie?"
62230,Marge,"homer, how did you think i'd feel when i saw that?"
62231,Marge,"homer, come down for dinner."
62235,Marge,you have to understand -- ray doesn't exist.
62248,Marge,"oh, fine."
62259,Marge,jimminy kimmel! look how much they're charging for bart's treatment!
62262,Marge,"bart, what are you doing here?"
62271,Marge,but your song said you liked springfield.
62273,Marge,"homie, i'm worried you're turning into some kind of super koo-koo stage mother."
62274,Marge,"bart, you wanna go to the video arcade?"
62276,Marge,"hey, kids! i scream, you scream, we all scream for..."
62277,Marge,haircuts!
62286,Marge,okay then. let's get the rest of this hair back in the freezer.
62300,Marge,but we don't have a sitter for maggie.
62317,Marge,"bart, this could be a good new school... oakwood academy! huh?"
62320,Marge,how 'bout this one -- st. jerome's catholic school?
62324,Marge,"homer, you've been out all night! and you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something. were you at that catholic church?!"
62330,Marge,where's homer and bart?
62346,Marge,why would we want to go to santa's village? it's august.
62349,Marge,fros-ty! where's your magic top hat?
62351,Marge,"look, i know this wasn't the greatest outing, but your father meant well, so don't let him know that we didn't ."
62353,Marge,is this a snuggle film?!
62358,Marge,you are.
62369,Marge,i think the worst part was when i realized that homer lied to me.
62370,Marge,exactly!
62371,Marge,maybe you could just put a hat on him and say it's a trick.
62372,Marge,huh.
62377,Marge,"aw, you're a good thing. i know it. let me clean out your ears."
62379,Marge,where is he taking me?
62383,Marge,ooo.
62388,Marge,"oh, my sweet, sweet homie! you sacrificed yourself for the manatees."
62391,Marge,don't you have to be back at work?
62393,Marge,"well, they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us. what ever happened to ""please"" and ""thank you""?"
62406,Marge,"lisa, do you really want to watch this?"
62408,Marge,"i don't care what apu was in a past life. in this life, he's a blabbermouth!"
62415,Marge,we need professional help.
62418,Marge,four thousand dollars?!
62420,Marge,the cemetery? and you're just sitting here?
62429,Marge,amen!
62431,Marge,no!
62439,Marge,"look, why don't you both stay and have one of my marge-aritas?"
62442,Marge,"you sit in this oatmeal awhile, and it'll send your itchies packing! homer!"
62445,Marge,how could you ask me that?
62448,Marge,"no, no, no!"
62467,Marge,a robot?
62471,Marge,"oh, he knows how to push all my buttons."
62475,Marge,"well, the important thing is we're a family again."
62481,Marge,staying out eighteen hours and not calling home once.
62487,Marge,"i'm so glad we came to paradise pier. ever since i was a little girl, i've wanted to ride that ferris wheel!"
62492,Marge,"homie, if i buy a bicycle built for two, will you ride with me?"
62502,Marge,"well, i hope neil young will remember..."
62506,Marge,wanna go inside?
62515,Marge,"well, we could bike to the tea shop and have some cake."
62517,Marge,"ooh, such respect! you could grow up to be a doorman!"
62520,Marge,you... invited me... to your treehouse? wow -- that's like bruce wayne letting his mother into the bat-club.
62524,Marge,just kidding. today's mom knows to seal 'em in mylar so you can never read them again. never ever again.
62525,Marge,where are you two going?
62526,Marge,uh-huh. and how will this affect your job at the power plant?
62529,Marge,"oh, ba-art!"
62533,Marge,no!
62538,Marge,"well, now i'm not so sure about the bells on the painter's pants."
62542,Marge,sweet home alabama / where the skies are so blue
62550,Marge,you what?!
62553,Marge,did you just vomit in that suit?
62555,Marge,i'd better wash that thing. it's hard to know where the suit ends and you begin.
62557,Marge,this house has such beautiful wainscoting.
62559,Marge,tea? in the parlor?
62564,Marge,i guess i'm not meant to have friends.
62567,Marge,what are you doing today?
62570,Marge,"oh, you guys make everything fun."
62573,Marge,"tammy, i'd never have had the courage to skydive if it weren't for you girls."
62577,Marge,you're not joking. any other surprises?
62578,Marge,"i'm sorry, i can't steal. not even from mr. burns."
62580,Marge,"okay, okay, okay, i'm in!"
62581,Marge,oh... uh... uh... bird watching.
62584,Marge,all i wanted to do was join a group of women who wore the same outfits.
62587,Marge,"wow, this is special."
62593,Marge,"hello. i'm marge. this is my husband homer, my daughters lisa and maggie and my son -- bart simpson."
62597,Marge,uh... well...
62601,Marge,he deserves to be hailed at this wing ding.
62604,Marge,"boy, that sideshow bob goes from zero to murder awfully fast."
62608,Marge,where's reverend lovejoy? he's never been late for christmas service.
62609,Marge,get him outta here!
62623,Marge,no!
62627,Marge,"love always... 'm'."""
62628,Marge,"homer, that means your dad might not be your dad!"
62639,Marge,"while the boys are gone, we'll sell all their useless junk and replace it with knickknacks and curios."
62640,Marge,"you know, your father saved every book report he ever wrote. and every one was stuart little!"
62642,Marge,that's right.
62643,Marge,fine.
62644,Marge,my yard sale is a failure. i guess i'll have to give everything to the salvation army.
62645,Marge,i guess -- they're homer's expired pain medications.
62655,Marge,"homer, i hope you get this. i'm in jail and i need ten thousand dollars bail. hurry!"
62656,Marge,"sweetie, if someone's bullying you, you should tell your teacher."
62659,Marge,"aw, homie."
62665,Marge,"well, it creeps me out!"
62669,Marge,what are those doing there?
62671,Marge,"""local anahoopi indians believed this stalactite was the finger of tsisnajini, their god of pointing down."""
62675,Marge,"wait, wait, wait, there's one thing i don't understand here."
62687,Marge,"reverend, why do we really need this?"
62696,Marge,"okay, game over -- it's a tie!"
62707,Marge,"well, maybe we can take your mind off things by studying for the s.a.t.: ""snuggles and tickles."""
62711,Marge,where's bart? i haven't seen him since you came home.
62714,Marge,sorry i asked.
62719,Marge,"she's kissing his boo-boo! that's it, i'm going in."
62721,Marge,"while you were living the glamorous life of a tv chimp, i was raising my son. you have no right to take him away from me now. please, please, give me back my boy."
62724,Marge,i believe he's saying he's okay.
62727,Marge,that's just a souvenir from an amusement park.
62733,Marge,i'll do it!
62734,Marge,i'll do it.
62735,Marge,"i'll do it! wait, i wasn't happy with that."
62741,Marge,"that leaves ""a"" and ""b"" available for overflow. well done!"
62743,Marge,he's a very impressive boy.
62749,Marge,that sounds horrible.
62757,Marge,i thought life preservers only came in orange. because wouldn't it be hard to see blue in the ocean?
62761,Marge,"what? no! listen, charles, i don't want to hurt your feelings..."
62766,Marge,"he's loved me ever since the first moment he saw me and he's never stopped. and whatever it takes to make me happy, he'll do it even if it kills him."
62769,Marge,me too.
62773,Marge,"homie, snagging a pro football franchise is a big project, requiring a lot of follow-through..."
62774,Marge,"homie, you've been down here for a week, i really think you need- what the hellmann's real mayonnaise?!"
62780,Marge,"homie, you should give your dad a call. you can't stay mad at him forever."
54591,Marge,"homer, i really don't want to feed you."
54593,Marge,tonight i learned the two of us can't work.
62786,Marge,"homie, i got you something to read on the plane."
62787,Marge,"it's a book about management, and lee iacocca says it's ""definitely, dot dot dot useful."""
54597,Marge,i can't believe i got in. it's like a dream come true. an expensive dream.
54599,Marge,"homie, my mind has been opened in so many ways! did you know that every u.s. president has been a straight white man?"
62791,Marge,it's may!
54606,Marge,are the lasers supposed to burn you?
62800,Marge,constance prudence chastity goodfaith.
54612,Marge,i sure am! i want your knowledge inside me!
62806,Marge,good times.
54616,Marge,"oh, evolve yourself, professor jerk -- or should i say, associate professor jerk!"
54625,Marge,okay.
62819,Marge,"homer, the ship's upside down and hundreds of people are dead!"
62820,Marge,"homer, what should we do?"
54632,Marge,"homie, i was so worried about you. i was really mad at you tonight, but you're a good person and that's what i see most of the time. whatever problems we have, we have a lifetime to work them out. together."
54633,Marge,fraternity pledges in their beanies...
62826,Marge,"well, a woman also invented the windshield wiper."
62830,Marge,"yes, unless..."
62831,Marge,there. you're the perfect little he-she.
62833,Marge,you never take our kids to the movies.
54649,Marge,"but steffan, i would like to get married some day."
62841,Marge,untidy! untidy! untidy!
62842,Marge,now this is a house that's ready to be cleaned!
54655,Marge,my hair!
62851,Marge,but you're so much more... ravaged than i am.
62855,Marge,you strangle your child?
54666,Marge,"whatever you say, little boy."
62859,Marge,i know that sound!
54668,Marge,"oh, homie."
62861,Marge,lisa! my little know-it-all!
54670,Marge,wait nicely!
62862,Marge,milhouse! you're bart's best friend!
54673,Marge,won't the other homer be a problem?
62866,Marge,i don't know. maybe there's something unpleasant blocking my memory of you.
54676,Marge,"well, i think you're helping us make progress."
54679,Marge,"because we have no way of communicating with the outside world! tell me, has robert fulton invented the steamboat yet?"
62871,Marge,you're describing how to parallel park.
54684,Marge,"side-by-side on my piano keyboard / oh lord, why don't we..."
54685,Marge,everything's fine! cupcakes and sprinkles!
54688,Marge,my eye!
54689,Marge,"no, it can't be! i would never hurt marge! i'm a good man!"
54690,Marge,homer?! i wasn't expecting you.
62882,Marge,"that works for hiccups, not amnesia."
54694,Marge,duffman?
54695,Marge,diamonds! i still can't believe he gave me diamonds!
62898,Marge,"i still don't remember you, but for the first time since this happened, i wish i did... homer."
62903,Marge,"oh, and her."
54712,Marge,hm... could this show help me with eating cheating?
54718,Marge,"oh no, he yawned -- i'm boring him!"
62911,Marge,what?!
62919,Marge,"well, i might as well see what all the fuss is about."
54728,Marge,"homer, please. we've never thrown a party. now we're gonna pay back all the friends who've invited us to their homes."
62923,Marge,"honey, i appreciate the thought, but just leave everything to me."
62925,Marge,"look, homie, i brought you a beer."
54743,Marge,we'll be there!
62937,Marge,"ooh, the baseball-playing man! i barely recognized you without your costume on."
54754,Marge,"hello, reverend. we're glad we could come. oh, hello helen."
62951,Marge,or take the same limo.
62956,Marge,"crossed arms mean ""no."""
54770,Marge,"ohhh, homer."
54774,Marge,"so, did you kids have fun?"
62966,Marge,"i hope you're happy, bart. thanks to your hi-jinx, i have to drive you and your friends to school."
54776,Marge,homer!
54779,Marge,"but the big day finally came. and because i'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good."
62973,Marge,"we'd love to! you know, i've never met your wife."
62978,Marge,"i've tried to make those, but they always end up as brownies."
54787,Marge,"boys, you better come in the house. you don't want to get the sniffles."
54794,Marge,"sixteen permanent, eight baby."
54795,Marge,xl.
54798,Marge,glow in the dark monster make-up.
54799,Marge,"oh, homie, you have lots of hair... why did you want to know your blood type?"
62992,Marge,"he's gotta fall asleep sometime, doesn't he?"
62995,Marge,look! bart's onstage... and he's contributing to the entertainment!
62997,Marge,"look... uh... how 'bout we go to the pound, and get a puppy just for you?"
54807,Marge,"please, homie? for me?"
54808,Marge,homer... breakfast is ready.
62999,Marge,"see, lisa. we're making progress."
63002,Marge,"honey, what you're feeling is called ""empathy."""
54823,Marge,i washed it.
63016,Marge,"oh, the floorboard broke my nightstand."
54825,Marge,i don't know how this could have happened.
54826,Marge,"homer, please. no one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work."
63019,Marge,i could start my own carpentry business. i'm already arranging the clip art for the letterhead in my mind.
54834,Marge,"oh, homie."
63031,Marge,i guess i don't.
54842,Marge,it certainly has enriched our lives.
63037,Marge,your father's finally gonna get exposed as the credit-stealing fraud he is!
63043,Marge,i'm gonna go look at the new babies.
54852,Marge,"i know, honey, but just sit still."
63044,Marge,look! a shooting star!
54854,Marge,imprisoned congressman becomes born-again christian.
54855,Marge,"no, that was about the budget gap. this is the trading gap."
54856,Marge,i think it means he's having a barbecue.
54857,Marge,"he's trying to be friendly. you know, if you gave ned flanders a chance --"
63053,Marge,what?! homer! our son joined the army!
54866,Marge,"bart, don't use the touch of death on your sister."
63059,Marge,i'd give anything to hear homer's voice.
54869,Marge,you got a job? doing what?
63064,Marge,we're going to dump it in the water to get the army drunk.
54873,Marge,"well, bart's been acting very strangely. and that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks."
63068,Marge,"hustle your bustles, gang! we're going to the senior olympics to root for grampa!"
63069,Marge,"kids, grab a fold."
54879,Marge,"well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us."
63072,Marge,i wonder if the dog thought about us while we were gone.
54885,Marge,"how are you enjoying your ham, homie?"
63080,Marge,"oh, you should be ashamed! your father works very hard to put lobsters on our table. every night, he comes home exhausted, with his voice too hoarse to talk."
54889,Marge,you mean you still haven't made up with him?
63082,Marge,i've been doing the same thing for the last ten years. and all i have to show for it is a clean floor.
63084,Marge,i'm glad someone in this house feels their life has meaning.
63085,Marge,"i just wish i could do something to be remembered by... something that says ""marge was here!"" after i'm gone."
54895,Marge,you be good.
54899,Marge,"well, thank you for calling. good-bye."
63095,Marge,you're from texas?
63098,Marge,you can't go to work! i need you here for emotional support -- plus you make a small crowd look huge!
54918,Marge,"good morning, dear."
54920,Marge,now hadn't you better get ready for school?
54921,Marge,bart!
54922,Marge,"that's it, young man. you're coming with me..."
54923,Marge,please?
63115,Marge,"dear lord, thank you for the physical intimacy we are about to enjoy."
63118,Marge,"well, if no one else jumped off the empire state building, would you not jump?"
63120,Marge,you're getting a husband! and you are going to that party!
54931,Marge,that's a long shot.
54932,Marge,bingo.
63129,Marge,what is all this?
54939,Marge,we can't afford to buy a pony.
63131,Marge,i'll tell you why: christian charity.
63134,Marge,"listen, uh, gil... i sort of thought... ya know, you'd be on your way by now."
54944,Marge,you sound like you're going to buy a pony. promise me you won't.
63138,Marge,yes. one. involving you.
63139,Marge,really?
54950,Marge,"hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. we're just going to have to cut down on luxuries."
54951,Marge,"actually, i was thinking we could cut down on your beer."
54954,Marge,"all right. you got us into this, you get us out."
54956,Marge,"homie, how long do you plan to do this?"
54957,Marge,thirty years?
54958,Marge,"he's just exhausted. lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony?"
63151,Marge,that photoshopping freak!
63154,Marge,marge simpson is gonna say no!
54967,Marge,ed asner?
54968,Marge,"homer, are you ordering junk off the tv again?"
63162,Marge,i'll ask these active seniors if they know gil.
54973,Marge,"homer, could you turn off the tv? there's a little test i want you to take."
63167,Marge,no!!!
63168,Marge,this is so exciting -- watching a movie outside with the whole town.
54979,Marge,"that's your hero. ""name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
63172,Marge,where's maggie?
54982,Marge,"oh really? well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see."
54984,Marge,don't you at least have something to say to bart?
63176,Marge,"homer, that's too much sugar!"
54988,Marge,"honey, what's wrong?"
63181,Marge,homer! you made an effort!
63182,Marge,"homer, this is wonderful. where are the kids?"
63183,Marge,can i go again?
55000,Marge,"oh, homer!"
55003,Marge,you spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer?
63196,Marge,"well, let me tell you a story about a time revenge brought only unhappiness and misery. it happened many years ago in paris--"
63199,Marge,"oh mon cher, i am the luckiest wife in the entire sixteenth arrondissement! let us kiss with the tongues."
55008,Marge,"now, bart, lisa did a wonderful job on my hair and we saved forty dollars for the family. we all have to pull together 'til your father gets a new job."
55010,Marge,"hmmm, you shouldn't do that."
55011,Marge,"that's good, lisa."
63203,Marge,homer...
63206,Marge,"for me, huh? what took you so long?"
63208,Marge,"so you see homer, revenge only leads to misery."
55017,Marge,"""if ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail"". well, i guess i'd better go see dr. hibbert."
55018,Marge,"well, i have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix i did with the other kids."
55019,Marge,"well, i'll let you know."
63209,Marge,weren't you listening? i just told you a whole story about revenge.
55024,Marge,"no, i mean how you plan to earn a living. i can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating."
55025,Marge,"i think about you, too."
55029,Marge,"actually, she was singing about god."
55034,Marge,"well, that unforgettable night we... joined the castle club..."
63228,Marge,"oh, yes sir... as shocks go, this one's a real zaparoo."
55038,Marge,is this it?
63231,Marge,what do you want?
63234,Marge,"wait just a cotton-swabbing minute! a good man went to a lot of trouble just to impress you! and i went along with it, because i love him to pieces! and you made him look like a fool. well, i don't want you anywhere near my house!"
55045,Marge,luke?
55046,Marge,marcus?
55048,Marge,there certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.
63243,Marge,"homie, you woke up early?"
63244,Marge,"dr. swanson, i'm bart's mother. i've been saving this money for my husband's breast reduction surgery. but i think this is more important. would you please see bart again?"
63250,Marge,nothing like un-tossing a leftover salad. it'll be like new!
63251,Marge,what the heck are these?
55060,Marge,"""you will not see me again until i am a man."" oh, homer, homer."
55063,Marge,my husband by my side.
63255,Marge,look at grampa and selma frolicking in the water.
55075,Marge,"homer, that's -- ohh!"
55077,Marge,"homie, isn't he beautiful?"
55079,Marge,"homer, i'm not pregnant."
55081,Marge,"bart, your grampa's on the phone. he wants to wish you a happy birthday."
63274,Marge,"well, it's just about what we need to pay for our fire damage."
63275,Marge,bart gets another try!
63276,Marge,"well, i do like the extra money. but i think maybe you should stop exploiting human beings' private misfortunes."
55085,Marge,"testing... testing... one, two, three... oh, my. do i sound like that?"
55086,Marge,i bet you could have a lot of fun with this. why don't you go show your father?
63278,Marge,sideshow mel is in a custody battle? and it's turning bitter?
55089,Marge,"oh, bart."
63286,Marge,i never have to look out the window again!
55104,Marge,"hmmm, well, if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap. i do it all the time. i pretend i'm interested in looking at power tools, going to those silly car chase movies, and... some things i'll tell you about when you're older. do you understand?"
55105,Marge,bart!
63299,Marge,who designed this character? probably a man...
55114,Marge,and don't make that face at me.
55116,Marge,bart?
55117,Marge,"oh bart, you could use some new underwear too."
63308,Marge,i should get some sleep...
55119,Marge,"well, we had fun too. right now, bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends."
55127,Marge,i did not! i promised i would get mad! she's an eight-year-old girl.
63319,Marge,"no, no. i'm fine."
63321,Marge,i'm also pleased!
63324,Marge,not at all!
55133,Marge,"now maggie, when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want."
55136,Marge,that's enough!
63328,Marge,don't you have to get to your job as a mattress salesman?
55139,Marge,"homer, i'm running late as it is. can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?"
63332,Marge,who would do this to bart?
63335,Marge,my baby!
55146,Marge,homer? is that you?
63339,Marge,i always thought that was just a slogan to attract small businesses. but now i know it's the truth.
55149,Marge,homer
55150,Marge,i need a vacation.
55151,Marge,i need to unwind.
63345,Marge,there it is -- ol' bounce 'n' giggle.
55154,Marge,i swear.
63349,Marge,"uh... the batter hit it by accident, not by design."
63350,Marge,"oooh, the new issue of ""smothering mother magazine."""
55159,Marge,check the dryer!
55164,Marge,"""bungee jumping, kayaking, calligraphy, cigar making, hula dancing... hmm... i guess i've done everything."
63356,Marge,"maggie, i'm sorry you miss your pacifier. but when a mother makes a decision, she has to stick by it."
63360,Marge,you make her stop! i've had her all day!
55170,Marge,"hi, did you miss me?"
55173,Marge,"well, i could use a little more. and sometimes i want a little time to myself, and i expect you to help --"
63369,Marge,just let the chemicals deal with it.
63373,Marge,"you should've seen the faces of your children when they caught you stealing. kids, get in here and show your father the faces!"
63383,Marge,i just meant we should split up to get out of this corn maze.
63384,Marge,now there must be a way out!
55196,Marge,"no, homer. the truth would humiliate her."
63389,Marge,homer!
63391,Marge,no street curs!
63392,Marge,it says here don't bother naming them. snakes have poor hearing and only live to strangle.
63394,Marge,"if someone did eat bart's shorts, they'd have a tummy full of pocket garbage!"
55204,Marge,"homer, go back to the garage."
63401,Marge,"now let's see, twenty minutes at three hundred degrees is the equivalent of five minutes at... twelve hundred degrees."
63402,Marge,now to make the folded index card that goes in front of the cake.
63405,Marge,"excuse me, excuse me, i'm in the sale! i'm in the sale!"
55215,Marge,"lisa, it's not that bad."
63411,Marge,"oh, my special little guy. i'm so glad you're okay."
55224,Marge,"oh... oh... unng... oh, bart."
55225,Marge,"lisa, why aren't you at band practice?"
63419,Marge,i'll just use homer's triple a card.
55228,Marge,"so you see, my sisters were wrong. except about the cities on the moon. i was wrong about that. so... well, you can see how anyone can be wrong."
63420,Marge,american applesauce association?!
63422,Marge,marge takes off in a sprint .
63424,Marge,oops.
55233,Marge,i buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. we each play our birthday. and that's enough excitement for me.
55235,Marge,you can still win some money if you have five out of six.
55237,Marge,"oh well... we lost the money, but at least we've still got each other."
63438,Marge,we have to take in mr. brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.
55248,Marge,"bart, from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at springfield barber college."
55250,Marge,... will now be chub night.
55252,Marge,"we all have to make sacrifices, dear. maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer..."
63447,Marge,"it's bad news, isn't it? i should never get my hopes up. nothing ever works out for us."
63448,Marge,really?
63451,Marge,what was that?
55262,Marge,"homer get a-hold of yourself. even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. remember doggie heaven."
55267,Marge,"well, since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie, your dad and i will pick a movie, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. hmm?"
55268,Marge,maybe we could see something a little more adult.
55272,Marge,"homer, if it makes you feel any better, most of what they threw at you splattered on me. homer?..."
63464,Marge,i'm not cooking!
55278,Marge,i don't want to. i'm mad at you.
63471,Marge,that doesn't sound like homer's usual annoyed grunt.
55280,Marge,homer! where did you get that suit?
63478,Marge,"aw, you're sweet."
55287,Marge,your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. and you did it at the county fair last year. remember?
63480,Marge,"sir, thank you for saving us. do you want to come in for coffee?"
63481,Marge,"i couldn't agree more, julia."
55292,Marge,what does that mean?
55296,Marge,you're not even listening to me!
55305,Marge,i'm just not.
55308,Marge,bart!
55309,Marge,"now, about your wedding dress. i'm not sure how to put this..."
63506,Marge,maggie's crying!
63508,Marge,i guess it's time to let my little girl grow up.
63511,Marge,"homer, where have you been?"
55322,Marge,"hmmm, i hope my poor little baby's okay."
55327,Marge,and it came with a free instruction book.
63521,Marge,"where are you, homie?"
63528,Marge,point zero eight sober.
55339,Marge,"i know how you feel, but he is good with the kids."
63531,Marge,that old man over there isn't even making a transaction. he just wants someone to talk to!
55341,Marge,"well, before you do that, maybe you should take the driving test again."
55342,Marge,i wish they had never invented fried cheese!
63541,Marge,"well, promises mean more to me."
55354,Marge,what in god's name are you talking about?
63546,Marge,"oh my, it's five o'clock! i missed visiting hours."
63548,Marge,"look, lisa. i put new filaments in all our burned-out light bulbs. your father the millionaire thought we should throw these away."
55361,Marge,herb! how have you been?
55362,Marge,can't complain.
63554,Marge,"don't give up hope, johnny!"
63555,Marge,dwight?! i was just on my way to see you in prison.
55367,Marge,"well, i really think we need to replace the washer and dryer."
63561,Marge,can you at least put it in your jacket?
55370,Marge,whoooa!!
63563,Marge,"boy, i really feel like a viking in this thing."
55373,Marge,"homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these."
63568,Marge,thank you.
55377,Marge,"bart, where's your bathing suit?"
55379,Marge,"it's our last family dinner for six weeks, but i promised myself i wouldn't cry."
63574,Marge,you just can't get russian gangster blood out. must be something they eat.
55387,Marge,we miss you terribly. i hope these jelly bean cookies will tide you over until you get home.
55389,Marge,"oh... homer, it's getting late, we'll miss the fireworks."
63582,Marge,"all those nights i thought you were out getting drunk, you were out killing people?!"
55391,Marge,"i'm auditioning for a play! it's a musical version of ""a streetcar named desire."" isn't that exciting?"
55394,Marge,la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
63589,Marge,"bart, go out to the shed and get some more butane!"
55399,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey."
63591,Marge,"but some of my best friends are... fine, you can stay."
55402,Marge,love...
55411,Marge,ba-ba?
55413,Marge,"oh, well. be a good girl, maggie."
63605,Marge,stop naming things!
63609,Marge,our anniversary!
55424,Marge,the play's tomorrow night. ah've got to stay in character.
63616,Marge,i'd better join a gym before i go from hippy to hippo.
63617,Marge,"ooh, l.a.! this could be the gym for me."
63619,Marge,maybe i'll just hit the showers.
63624,Marge,when is straightman gonna pop the question?
63627,Marge,that's okay. i don't care that you don't care. go watch your thing.
63628,Marge,i sure am!
55438,Marge,i thought my life would be a mardi gras/ a never-ending party -- ha!/ i'm a faded southern dame without a dime...
55440,Marge,"whoever you are, i have always depended on the kindness of strangers."
55442,Marge,almost everybody.
63634,Marge,you also remembered i like flattery!
55445,Marge,"yeah, go on."
55447,Marge,really?
63639,Marge,and i'll just fold this old sweaty blanket and put it in the closet.
63642,Marge,okay.
63646,Marge,"ooo, opal!"
63648,Marge,i think i'll speed through the cheering.
55462,Marge,"homer, you're crazy. tell him this is all crazy."
55468,Marge,"oh, homey! are you all right?"
63666,Marge,"stop, homer! please!"
55475,Marge,"homer, lisa's already sensitive about her looks. this is the last thing she needs."
63670,Marge,"stop, homer! please!"
55482,Marge,oh grampa!
55489,Marge,oh my god.
63686,Marge,we wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd just paid the heating bill!
63688,Marge,"hey, parents are allowed to keep some secrets."
55503,Marge,"now kids, instead of candy, i thought i'd serve an array of healthy fresh fruits."
55505,Marge,whoa!
55506,Marge,"homer, did you barricade the door?"
63697,Marge,you don't have to tell the kids everything!
55511,Marge,that's the way we do it every year.
55512,Marge,is it 37?
55514,Marge,"oh, all right."
63708,Marge,"honey, this is how i save money on ketchup and mustard."
55519,Marge,we're talking about bart.
63713,Marge,it's your new diet!
63716,Marge,searching for evidence. i know your father's cheating on his diet.
55525,Marge,"please, homer. why do i always have to be the bad guy?"
55528,Marge,bart! stop being confident.
55531,Marge,why are you letting him do this?
55534,Marge,i wasn't here!
63728,Marge,what's up?
63730,Marge,"zack, you're not trying to help our marriage, you're trying to split us up! i'd rather have a chubby hubby than a sexy exy!"
55541,Marge,"resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of ""lemon time""..."
55544,Marge,did you notice how slanted he looked?
63750,Marge,"oh homie, i've been so happy lately. i'm completely fulfilled, both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet! now what did you want to say to me?"
55567,Marge,"oh, aren't you nice. gee, this makes me wonder why morale here is so low."
63766,Marge,"hello, are you royce lumpkin?"
55576,Marge,oh my goodness!
55577,Marge,my husband will be so excited.
55578,Marge,"homer, mr. burns gave me another raise today."
55579,Marge,you can't fire me just because i'm married. i'm going to sue the pants off you.
55580,Marge,"so, do you think i have a case?"
63770,Marge,i made that hug happen!
55582,Marge,"well, i guess that's it. people like us can't afford justice. come on homie, let's go before he fires you too."
63783,Marge,"you two have been bombarded with enough commercial images! lisa, i've got a big bunch of black bananas. you know what that means..."
55594,Marge,"oh, please don't. for me?"
63787,Marge,"all right, i've got an idea -- but it'll take a lot of sewing."
55596,Marge,don quixote.
63789,Marge,bart is a ten-year-old boy. he still sits in the driveway and pretends to drive the car.
55602,Marge,"bart, it's your bedtime. i laid out your jammy-jams."
63794,Marge,"okay, have fun at the laughter house. now i'll just turn off my phone to save the battery."
55608,Marge,"hi, homie. it's really starting to snow. i think you should come home."
55611,Marge,"oh, homie, didn't that hurt?"
55613,Marge,"i was wrong about you buying that truck. i'm very proud of you, mr. plow. ."
55618,Marge,"maggie, can you say ba-ba? can you say ma-ma?"
63811,Marge,"we know you love us, honey -- even though sometimes you show it in a ""quirky"" way."
55628,Marge,then the prince and the princess got married and lived happily ever after.
63823,Marge,say something comforting.
63827,Marge,"excuse me, i think i'm holding up better than you are. in fact, i've got energy to spare."
55636,Marge,bad baby!
55638,Marge,won't that warp him?
55641,Marge,oh dear.
55644,Marge,"we were about to give up, when we found a house that was perfect..."
63846,Marge,"well, um, thanks, but i've been wondering... why do you only have me make spheres, rods, and half-moon shapes?"
55661,Marge,"honey, you really shouldn't eat so much in bed."
63853,Marge,a sterling silver picture frame -- with pictures of our kids in it.
55664,Marge,"homer, i prepared a special surprise just for you."
55672,Marge,seventy dollars.
55674,Marge,"honey, did you have any luck?"
55675,Marge,"wait, this might be the answer we're looking for."
55676,Marge,how?
55680,Marge,"oh homie, i could never remarry..."
63872,Marge,"well, sweetie... i know i said you couldn't have a cell phone, but, in these days of stranger dangers and sinister ministers, i think it's important that we're in touch."
63875,Marge,bullies!
55684,Marge,"ohh, there's going to be a town meeting to decide how to spend mr. burns' money."
55689,Marge,well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition main street is in.
55692,Marge,but main street's still all cracked and broken.
55694,Marge,"homer, no..."
55696,Marge,"according to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. what if something goes wrong?"
55701,Marge,i'm going to see mr. lanley.
63893,Marge,thank god you're okay!
55704,Marge,"well, bye."
63899,Marge,bart simpson! did you just spray water on me?!
63901,Marge,why can't our son just behave?
63903,Marge,"no flicking boogers, and no driving into trees!"
55712,Marge,"no, he's a scientist."
55714,Marge,and that was the only folly the people of springfield ever embarked upon -- except for the popsicle stick skyscraper... and the fifty foot magnifying glass... and that escalator to nowhere.
55719,Marge,if you don't mind! we're on our way to a funeral.
55720,Marge,"homer, that's very rude of you."
63915,Marge,i don't like the look of those air quotes.
63916,Marge,"now, we tuck in the tummy, the tushy and the tootsies."
55727,Marge,selma! your date's over already?
55730,Marge,are you sure you've thought this through? a child can really change your life.
55731,Marge,have you been eating that sandwich again?
63924,Marge,"homer simpson, i would be delighted not to marry you."
55734,Marge,are you going to eat it?
55735,Marge,you look terrible.
63927,Marge,you haven't said you're sorry.
63930,Marge,that's how low you can go!
55740,Marge,it deals with a bookish young woman's efforts to enter rabbinical school.
63938,Marge,pumps are shoes! that explains a lot.
55748,Marge,"no, i just think you should talk to bart about-- good lord!"
55749,Marge,"homer, do you have an explanation for this bill?"
63941,Marge,"alberto, i'm not sure if this is such a good idea."
63951,Marge,"homer, those are our wedding bungees!"
63953,Marge,she's not here!?
55762,Marge,"honey, honey, i'd tell this boy that you're very flattered, but you're just not ready for this kind of thing."
55765,Marge,"homer, are you going to the duff brewery?"
63959,Marge,/
55768,Marge,hello.
63962,Marge,have fun!
63964,Marge,homie... i'm not sure about this new business of yours. you're making it too easy for couples to break up just because they hit a rough patch.
55773,Marge,do you need a beer to fall asleep?
63965,Marge,that's one of your breakup lines!
55775,Marge,do you ever drink to escape from reality?
63968,Marge,well maybe...
63969,Marge,"lisa, sweetie, i'm honored that you choose my name, but it's not that great. back in high school, the boys used to call me marge ""boob""-ier."
55778,Marge,did you say beer or deer?
55781,Marge,"bart, could you go get the cupcakes?"
55783,Marge,you've never looked better.
63980,Marge,"homer, i'm sure you didn't see anything. go to sleep."
55789,Marge,la la la la la la... la...
55792,Marge,bart!
63990,Marge,"your bees will have plenty of room in this old greenhouse. plus there are flowers, and it's near a prison so they'll have a place to sting people."
55800,Marge,lisa needs braces.
55802,Marge,"president of the union! i'm so proud of you, homie."
55809,Marge,homie!
55814,Marge,you look familiar. have we met before?
55815,Marge,bart!
64006,Marge,lisa has been seeing an awful lot of her new friend.
64007,Marge,there are limits to how much two people should be together.
55818,Marge,"society's loss, i suppose. but our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through."
55826,Marge,"""third notice,"" ""final notice,"" ""some guys are coming.""... ooh, what's this?"
55829,Marge,oh my god.
64022,Marge,"don't feel bad, homie. i married you! and you're a million times better than-- here comes vance!!!"
55833,Marge,time to go to the reunion.
64025,Marge,i see a hair.
55841,Marge,"that's wonderful, homie!"
55842,Marge,now remember bart. this is a religious school. so be very careful about what you say and do here.
55843,Marge,you're going to get an education. i'm going to teach you myself.
64036,Marge,"sweetheart, i think you'll feel better after we take a little walk..."
55846,Marge,i think i'll unplug that.
55847,Marge,i'm your new teacher. my name is mrs. simpson.
64038,Marge,...of school!
55851,Marge,"bart, i'd like you to read this copy of ""johnny tremain."" it's a book i read as a girl."
64045,Marge,i don't want anyone to ever get hurt.
64046,Marge,"we can discuss it later. right now, while you're here, you can help host my book club."
55855,Marge,slow... then fast.
64048,Marge,"no, sweetie. at this point in a marriage, a wife should know what her husband can do and what he can't. who was i to think you could mail an envelope?"
55860,Marge,"and a bottle of aspirin, please."
64053,Marge,that number's so big it has a comma!
55862,Marge,"uh... no, i-i guess i didn't."
64061,Marge,"homie, the faucet won't stop leaking."
64062,Marge,"ned please, you're our guest."
55876,Marge,"homer, i don't think this fish is quite dead yet."
55877,Marge,oh my goodness.
55878,Marge,what kind of slime would i marry? i don't understand.
55882,Marge,i hope you find somebody.
64074,Marge,oh my god. we're out on the street!
55884,Marge,"uh, it's beautiful."
55885,Marge,"your teenage son or daughter will think this wishbone necklace is really ""cool."""
55886,Marge,no one bought a wishbone necklace.
55896,Marge,i'm pretty sure there is.
64092,Marge,"maggie, you're coming home with me!"
64095,Marge,i'm sorry. but i know god would never ask a mother to sacrifice her child for the good of the world... again.
55905,Marge,"no, he hasn't."
55908,Marge,would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow squares?
55912,Marge,"homer, that isn't very nice."
55914,Marge,"homer, please. these boys sound very nice, but they're clearly nerds."
64107,Marge,while your father and your grandfather have a drink we're going to see sights.
64108,Marge,that's not how a family vacation works. we do things together while your father has fun without us.
55917,Marge,what's wrong with this phone? it's making crazy noises.
64110,Marge,come back here!
64111,Marge,"they say if you kiss the blarney stone, you get ""the gift of gab."" which is great, but i'm not sure i like the idea of getting a gift in return for kissing. what kind of a message is that for lisa and maggie? those are my daughters. but on the other hand, america doesn't have any stones worth kissing -- except for stone phillips. do you have one of him here? if so, he's our your him."
64116,Marge,"but then you remarried us, and we were as solid as ever."
64117,Marge,and i think apu got lucky with my sister.
55930,Marge,i'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward. and then we'll make him double it.
64124,Marge,"oh yes, homer! yes!"
55941,Marge,homer! are you all right?
64136,Marge,because their r.s.v.p. cards arrived one day after the deadline!
55945,Marge,that's a photo of homer and me at our wedding.
55946,Marge,well... homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself... before the wedding.
55948,Marge,"homer, stop picking at it."
55955,Marge,homer?
55958,Marge,"i'd like to pledge thirty dollars. oh, thank you!"
55959,Marge,"they need our support. besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet."
55960,Marge,you like ballet?
55961,Marge,"hello, ruth?"
64151,Marge,i'm just happy you're back. now let's get that chain off you.
55963,Marge,you promised. you can't back out like when you volunteered for that army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters'.
64153,Marge,"homer, one thing i've learned is that you don't need a fancy wedding when you're marrying the man you love."
55965,Marge,"sure, homer. trapped in vending machines. okay."
64155,Marge,blue roses!
64157,Marge,you want to know the score? i'll tell you the score.
64162,Marge,those are two different people!
55971,Marge,your point being?
64163,Marge,"oh! okay, i'm coming."
64164,Marge,"come on, maggie. have some grapefruit."
64168,Marge,"all right, homer. let's see what my baby's been up to."
55979,Marge,you already asked me that.
55980,Marge,don't wait up.
64172,Marge,"lisa is a little young to be taking ""happy pills."""
64173,Marge,"what's your angle, mister?"
55983,Marge,oh... i've heard a lot about shot kickers.
64174,Marge,"oh, bart, i don't care that this is just an act. you've finally become the boy every mother dreams of: a girl."
55985,Marge,"ooh, i've never been to an underground club."
64176,Marge,that's it! we're getting you off the meds!
64180,Marge,huh? a mysterious door!
55990,Marge,no. i couldn't.
64183,Marge,i can't wait to tell everyone!
55996,Marge,there's an awful lot of black smoke coming from my chimney.
64190,Marge,am i?
56000,Marge,"ruth, is there something you want to tell me?"
56001,Marge,mmm hmm.
64193,Marge,"well, i know a place in this house where you can really relax."
56006,Marge,yeah. everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely.
56007,Marge,"ruth, i've done a lot of thinking, and i really consider you a friend. and an important part of friendship is..."
56008,Marge,my god! that must be every policeman in springfield!
64200,Marge,gotta find a place to tinkle.
56010,Marge,"i'm sorry, i should have asked first."
64205,Marge,that's an awfully crowded classroom.
64207,Marge,i want my kids in a decent school!
56017,Marge,i don't know if this is a good idea.
64212,Marge,it's so kind of you to live there so our kids can go to a better school.
56023,Marge,kids. tell me the truth. am i no fun? do i just nag all the time?
56025,Marge,no. i'm fine. i'm going to my sisters' now.
56029,Marge,"exactly! so from now on, i'm going to quit nagging and have more fun."
64230,Marge,without me?
56042,Marge,money's too tight for steak.
56043,Marge,"sure, steak."
56044,Marge,"i know you think the junior campers are square and... ""uncool,"" but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies."
64235,Marge,"although, i am gonna miss our little love nest."
64237,Marge,"a woman can be smart, beautiful and powerful. like queen elizabeth the first! she had it all, except the most important thing."
64240,Marge,four hundred years before kirk gibson would hit his famous home run.
56049,Marge,"hi, hober. dote kiss be, i'b all stuffed up."
56055,Marge,this could be a whole new beginning for springfield.
64249,Marge,"out, damn'd spot! out, i say!"
56061,Marge,i was for the casino!
64254,Marge,tonight the springfield community playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star... dr. hibbert as banquo?!
56063,Marge,"i wonder if they have a lost and found. oh, what the hey."
64255,Marge,he's the one getting the good reviews! which makes him the next one you've got to kill.
64262,Marge,"no, i just encouraged him."
64263,Marge,"oh homie, you were brilliant. i knew you could do it. i knew it..."
56079,Marge,"lisa's costume. homer, i didn't realize. i'm so sorry."
56080,Marge,"you know, you're right, homer. maybe i should get some professional help."
56085,Marge,homer! that necklace was a priceless bouvier family heirloom.
56092,Marge,"homer, wasn't the whole point to catch the cat burglar?"
64285,Marge,come and get me.
64287,Marge,"i'm glad you've got such a stimulating substitute, but i'm worried about mrs. krabappel."
56101,Marge,"honey, i know you feel a little silly saying the same four words over and over, but you shouldn't. you're making people happy. and that's a very hard thing to do."
56102,Marge,the best performance of your life?
64295,Marge,"ultimate punching?! ""ultimate"" makes everything worse!"
56106,Marge,it certainly is exotic.
56108,Marge,"apu, we usually store our cans in the cupboard."
56110,Marge,"well, i guess we could go to that new monstromart..."
64303,Marge,this goes on for a while...
64306,Marge,i'm marge simpson and i will not rest until you tear down this septagon!
56115,Marge,i guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
56116,Marge,how did it go?
64308,Marge,"guys, please. when you yell like that, no one can hear me."
56120,Marge,"i understand, honey. when i was your age there was a..."
64313,Marge,that flattens my soda pop! you're on!
64314,Marge,"thank you, homie."
56126,Marge,"well, we respect you."
64319,Marge,listen... i'm late for a p.t.a. meeting.
56131,Marge,"homer, you already dialed."
64324,Marge,nobody needs to know that! skip ahead!
64329,Marge,okey-doke.
64331,Marge,"well, i wish somebody would've stuck around to hear it."
56142,Marge,are you planning to hit ned flanders with that pipe and take his tickets?
64337,Marge,we don't have a panic room!
56146,Marge,that was you!
64338,Marge,i can't shoot her. she's lisa's godmother.
56155,Marge,fine.
56158,Marge,stop remembering tv and get back to work.
64351,Marge,"i stopped my crying / why, i don't know / but this rosey, cozy, bubbles-in-my-nose-y / makes me wanna have... mo'!"
64355,Marge,"oh my god, i've never felt so... uncreeped-out by you!"
64360,Marge,"i call to order this meeting of the ""springfield charity chicks."" as you all know, last year's cake and cookie sale raised one hundred twelve dollars to fight childhood obesity."
56173,Marge,this is just what happened at the caramel factory.
64365,Marge,"mmmm, i love this wine."
64366,Marge,"well, it seems real to me."
64367,Marge,whoops!
64368,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful!"
56178,Marge,"i've gotta stop fantasizing about lee majors. ah, one more."
64370,Marge,i've been pin-upped!
64373,Marge,"homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages."
56184,Marge,"bart, don't throw peas at your sister."
56189,Marge,what about peter fonda?
64381,Marge,"some lingerie from ""the horny hubby""... and ""snuggle"" dice."
56193,Marge,the point is the real simpson family missed you a lot and we're really glad you're home.
56196,Marge,why don't you bring this potato? it's pretty big.
56198,Marge,the dog has had enough excitement.
64391,Marge,i guess it'll just be dinner for four.
64394,Marge,you could wash this iceberg lettuce.
56203,Marge,hmm?
64401,Marge,"homie, you're back!"
64407,Marge,oh look how the snow glistens on the tiniest branches!
56216,Marge,"homer, would you please stop reading that ross perot pamphlet?!"
64410,Marge,that runs on electricity also.
64416,Marge,which position should we try?
56227,Marge,mom's almost ready for her date. she sure seems taken by this new beau. i feel so bad for grampa.
56228,Marge,"he's an awful, awful, awful man, but i guess if he makes mom happy, that's all that really matters."
64420,Marge,mm-hmm... and swivel that till you hear a grinding noise...
64421,Marge,"a few more minor adjustments, aaand..."
56231,Marge,"we're all aware of grampa's problems, but compared to mr. burns, he's judge freaking reinhold!"
64423,Marge,"bart, you've always been a handful, but you've never interfered with my reproductive freedom. why now?"
64429,Marge,"a bird eating potato chips... my feet walking... that boy who got sick on the tram... grampa talking to a mermaid hedge... the park rules in spanish... a fat baby... grampa telling a story to a trailer hitch... oops, i erased them all!"
64431,Marge,"grampa, no stories! you can come with us, or sit here on the shark bench."
64433,Marge,he does all the time. you just never listen.
64436,Marge,i don't like this -- real humor comes from people being nice to each other.
64443,Marge,tomato!
56254,Marge,"you just don't get it, do you, homer? you told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. i can't trust you anymore."
64453,Marge,"did i hear ""lettuce?"""
64454,Marge,lettuce who?
64455,Marge,lettuce... congratulate the new couple.
56264,Marge,"but, how do i know i can trust you?"
64458,Marge,seven-oh-seven? that's exactly the moment i was furious at you for missing our toast. and now i'm the one who has to ask... can you forgive me?
64466,Marge,you were what?!
56276,Marge,"my, these seas are certainly heaving."
56278,Marge,"lisa, stop blowing my sex! i mean, stop blowing your sax. your sax. stop it."
64472,Marge,"so if you go for oysters and i go for ersters, i'll order oysters and cancel the ersters / for we know we need each other so we / better call the calling off off, / let's call the whole thing ooooofff!"
64473,Marge,"okay kids, time to apply the final ""date night"" touch. lisa, spray just a hint of perfume on my neck, bart, you tell me this dress doesn't make me look fat. and... now!"
64475,Marge,really? how romantic?
56285,Marge,"well, you'll always be number one to me..."
64477,Marge,this isn't fair! i want romance!
56287,Marge,"oh, for chri..."
64479,Marge,"ooh, ice skating."
56290,Marge,"while you were out ""earning"" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. the plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in monday."
64485,Marge,the realest thing i've ever done.
56294,Marge,"homer, when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme?"
56299,Marge,"homie, do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives?"
56301,Marge,it's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole saturday drinking beer in maggie's kiddy pool.
64496,Marge,well who made you the coach?
56305,Marge,how many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
64497,Marge,"well, homer's my soul mate! and you don't dump a soul mate!"
64502,Marge,"i'm not horny, i'm mad."
56311,Marge,"no, no, no. no, ask your heart what its fondest desire is."
56313,Marge,"that's not the idea at all. okay, well this story isn't ideal, i've never told it to you before."
56314,Marge,i got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless.
64508,Marge,homer!
56317,Marge,i'm awfully sorry.
56324,Marge,no.
56328,Marge,but...
56333,Marge,you didn't have to drop me off.
64532,Marge,"it's okay, bart. just do a couple vocabulary words, then come have some milk and cookies."
64533,Marge,never mind what he said. you just listen to me.
56348,Marge,"say! i've got a neat idea. why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner."
64541,Marge,"well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!"
56350,Marge,they hit it off right away. but there were rivals for the fair lady's hand...
64550,Marge,"till the two of us are back on track, bart can fend for himself."
64552,Marge,i'm gonna go paste your heads back into the family photos. i've got them right here.
56361,Marge,homer.
64554,Marge,nope.
64559,Marge,and i'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons!
64560,Marge,homer?
64561,Marge,i thought you were fixing my brakes!
64566,Marge,"that's not bart, it's principal skinner. bart's sitting right next to you."
56375,Marge,this year i want us to do things together as a family and get a lot of good exercise outdoors so we'll have a lot of wonderful memories of our vacation.
64567,Marge,"homer, i can hear your sarcasm from inside the house -- and the dishwasher's on! what's going on here?"
64568,Marge,"ned flanders, you would take our family to the holy land just to try to make my husband a better man?"
64571,Marge,"and homer, put on some pants."
56385,Marge,"oh, i see. all right. i'll have the baby guts."
56386,Marge,oh.
64577,Marge,"oh homie, you're alive!"
56388,Marge,"tortureland, explosion land, searing gas pain land, unnecessary surgery land..."
64580,Marge,what's he gonna do now?
64581,Marge,"thanks, but you can stop giving the tour now."
64585,Marge,no one in this family is hurling rotten anything at anyone!
56394,Marge,kids?
56397,Marge,"i want all five t-shirts to say, ""best vacation ever."""
64590,Marge,bon appétit!
56407,Marge,"you know, you're right. this truly was the best vacation ever. now, let us never speak of it again."
56408,Marge,"i hope you realize now that violence on tv may be funny, but it's not so funny when that violence is happening to you."
56410,Marge,"this sounds awfully controversial. lisa, you know i don't like controversy in this house."
56412,Marge,"homer, we've got to stop them."
64610,Marge,homer? you have visitors.
56419,Marge,"feelin' fine, well, that's a relief."
64613,Marge,my smoothie is a lumpy!
56422,Marge,"you stay here 'til you're no longer insane. mmmm, chili would be good tonight."
64615,Marge,our wedding china's ruined.
56424,Marge,no answer.
56429,Marge,hmph. it's raining again.
64622,Marge,does he have a cute accent?
56440,Marge,no. he looks like something might be disturbing him.
56441,Marge,i guess we could get more involved in bart's activities. but then i'd be afraid of smothering him.
56442,Marge,that's not what i meant.
64633,Marge,"i don't want to get homer in trouble, but it's just plain wrong to use that blind spot to turn our back yard into a mecca of misdemeanors!"
64634,Marge,"you guys should go on that cruise. you'll have a great time, and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father..."
56445,Marge,"homer, stop that. i believe him."
64636,Marge,that's something you've been putting off.
56447,Marge,"bart honey, do you know who did take the money?"
56454,Marge,no.
64646,Marge,i'm still mad at you from last night.
64647,Marge,what do you think?
56466,Marge,"you caught me at a real bad time, moe. i hope you understand i'm too tense to pretend i like you."
64659,Marge,"honey, his name is walt warren, and he's a very nice man. he stopped me from driving away with my coffee cup on top of the car."
56468,Marge,no.
64661,Marge,what are you doing?! you're indoors at an outdoor party!
56471,Marge,he tripped my boy. i demand vengeance! i want vengeance!
56475,Marge,"well, that's the babysitter. no one in town will sit for you two anymore. i had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scary-looking hobo."
64671,Marge,"walt, why didn't you tell your story to the guards?"
56486,Marge,"i already talked to the indignation coordinator out on the lawn today. i told her you were a decent man. but she wouldn't listen. besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more i can do."
64683,Marge,still wanna be at moe's?
64690,Marge,hyper!
64694,Marge,in the mood for another round?
56503,Marge,we need to talk about the... marital difficulties we've been having lately.
64696,Marge,what is it?
64699,Marge,well you can take another -- in forty years!
56509,Marge,sane planning: sensible tomorrow.
64702,Marge,"well, you could get some ice cream, or...spend a week at performing arts camp!"
64703,Marge,whoops -- didn't time that quite right.
56512,Marge,kids? kids?
56521,Marge,you tell bart all the time. you told him this morning.
56522,Marge,what if you pretended that this couch were a bar? then you could spend more nights at home with us. huh?
64714,Marge,is it your laundry?
56525,Marge,"i don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden."
56526,Marge,"oh, i forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer. if someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a fire."
64717,Marge,"it's not your fault, grampa. these cards are too slippery. see?"
56529,Marge,let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off!
64725,Marge,why wouldn't i?
56534,Marge,i just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog. they've been living in sin.
64728,Marge,i'll take it!
56546,Marge,they do so!
56547,Marge,no! no!
56548,Marge,but it's true. they didn't write their own songs or play their own instruments.
56550,Marge,"i keep having the same dream. i'm the mother from ""lost in space."""
64742,Marge,"homie, maybe you could do it."
56554,Marge,"sure, okay. i'll talk about father. father christmas. that's what they call santa claus in england. they drive on the wrong side of the road there. now that's crazy. people are always saying how small england is. but you couldn't fit it all in here. not by a long shot. you know what? i'm cured."
56558,Marge,i was a little girl...
64754,Marge,mike scioscia! didn't you get radiation poisoning working at the springfield nuclear plant?
64756,Marge,i still think it's too violent.
56566,Marge,"wait, some other stuff's coming back to me."
56567,Marge,you think those could also have contributed to my fear of flying?
64759,Marge,"oh homie, what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters."
64764,Marge,i'm not really in the mood anymore.
56577,Marge,kids can be so cruel.
64769,Marge,why did you do that?
64770,Marge,no it wasn't!
64775,Marge,"oh roger, would you hand me the suntan oil?"
64778,Marge,roger was telling the truth!
56589,Marge,homer!
56595,Marge,me too. let's go home.
56596,Marge,"i love you too, homie."
64792,Marge,"ooo, everything's changed! that tree used to be a smaller tree. and that food bank used to be a regular bank."
64797,Marge,you see that mirror? i discovered that if i sat in the kitchen i could see if the bathroom was free using the reflection from the mirror off the toaster.
56610,Marge,"i'll stay here, but i'm gonna think about products i might like to purchase."
56611,Marge,"ooh, i don't have that."
64805,Marge,that's odd. lisa just threw her saxophone out the window.
56614,Marge,and your bottom was a little bigger.
64806,Marge,she doesn't want to end up like me?!
64808,Marge,i remember everything.
56617,Marge,"well, actually -"
56618,Marge,my contractions started an hour ago.
64811,Marge,"uh-huh, yeah. here's your breakfast."
64812,Marge,not a good time!
64814,Marge,"we'd love to send you here, sweetie. we just can't afford it."
64821,Marge,is it a girl?
64822,Marge,"hm, i never figured him for the bully type."
56632,Marge,look!
56633,Marge,i think i'll have some wine.
64824,Marge,"i don't know, compliment his glasses."
56635,Marge,"hold still, homer. don't squirm."
64825,Marge,there we go. clean... and white... and soft.
64828,Marge,what business?
56642,Marge,bart!
56644,Marge,"homer, that's enough."
56646,Marge,i'll just have a cup of coffee.
64839,Marge,"i hope they use that spit for a good cause, like sealing wedding envelopes."
56648,Marge,coff - ee!
56650,Marge,we'll meet you boys back here for dinner. good luck honey.
56651,Marge,that seems very noisy and expensive for a souvenir. why don't you get this nice cap?
64843,Marge,"mr. burns, you can't hurt us after all we've done for you."
64844,Marge,you were given six weeks to live. and you've outlived it! i think what kept you alive was that for once in your life you were helping other people.
56654,Marge,"i can't believe our government would set up bart like that. i must say, i'm very angry at the state department right now."
64848,Marge,those creepy little claws...
56657,Marge,he wants to talk to you.
64852,Marge,we know. and we're going to do something about it.
56661,Marge,"i'm sorry. homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man."
64855,Marge,"homie, why don't you study these?"
64856,Marge,i bought it because catherine zeta jones told me to. what a fool i was.
64857,Marge,are you sure?
64858,Marge,we're bringing the dog because we've found him a new home at a farm upstate where he can run and play all day.
64860,Marge,"well, ""ditching"" is a harsh word."
56674,Marge,what's that paper?
64870,Marge,at least someone around here's got the christmas spirit.
64871,Marge,what?
64872,Marge,but you wanted those toys.
64875,Marge,"you can make it through this, marge. just think of homer."
64881,Marge,martha stewart! how did you get in here?!
56694,Marge,"it's supposed to say jay's name, not yours."
64887,Marge,i guess i'll never have a perfect christmas.
64888,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
64891,Marge,i know when the freakin' fiesta bowl is!
56700,Marge,yes.
64893,Marge,what's going on? i called the prison and they won't tell me where homer is!
56703,Marge,you don't have to do this.
56704,Marge,i don't think you're stupid.
64895,Marge,you never took me to that bar on the beach.
64896,Marge,sounds pretty good.
64898,Marge,i was afraid this day would come.
56714,Marge,"well, it was a lovely festival. the best movie won and mr. burns found there are some awards that can't be bought."
56718,Marge,"oh, don't worry, honey. i guarantee your father will behave."
64911,Marge,"sorry, i'm just not used to everyone behaving."
64912,Marge,"go out on a tuesday? who am i, charlie sheen?"
56726,Marge,"lisa, i can't believe it's your wedding day already."
56727,Marge,"oh, milhouse doesn't count."
64925,Marge,"it's close, but no."
56734,Marge,"no, no, our dog is out of control. he's wild, destructive, and has little or no respect for authority."
56739,Marge,i think they're in love.
56740,Marge,but she's not our dog.
64931,Marge,awww...
56745,Marge,"well, i'm going to write the dictionary people and have that checked. it feels like a mistake to me."
64937,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
56748,Marge,"oh, my. i've never seen anything like this."
64941,Marge,um... well... of course you did!
56752,Marge,"yeeesch! this house stinks! you're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?"
56753,Marge,"now i know we love the puppies very much, but i think they're getting to be a problem."
56754,Marge,"all right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. as long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. on a completely unrelated topic, i'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight."
56756,Marge,"we've got to be realistic, kids. who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of twenty-five puppies?"
64948,Marge,"very romantic. homer had the basketball game muted the whole time. oh, and then i found a gray hair. no big deal."
56758,Marge,"my, he certainly took that well."
56760,Marge,"dinner's on, dogs!"
64955,Marge,"well, what do you kids think of the real me?"
56764,Marge,"honey, maybe you should relax a little?"
56765,Marge,"i'm worried about the kids, homie. lisa's becoming very obsessive. this morning i caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat."
64956,Marge,"what do you think, homie?"
56771,Marge,ohh...kids have been doing that one since my day.
64965,Marge,"i thought you'd be more supportive. i mean, you went gray yourselves."
56775,Marge,i hate it when he gets in there.
64968,Marge,"sorry, but i'm fighting for my man!"
56777,Marge,"that's a very nice jig, kearney. now, isn't dancing much more fun than bullying?"
56778,Marge,"bart, are you ready for your history test?"
64978,Marge,"but be honest, when i say ""beautiful woman,"" what pops into your head?"
56791,Marge,aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
64986,Marge,"thanks, rollin' eighties."
56803,Marge,"lisa, unhand your brother."
64998,Marge,"homer simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. help him!"
56809,Marge,"actually, i'm interested in becoming a police officer."
65001,Marge,time to finally return your father's overdue movies.
56812,Marge,"hey everybody, mom's home."
65008,Marge,"haul away, driver man!"
56821,Marge,i just wanted to say hello.
56822,Marge,"two hundred. no! no! i mean, i mean nothing. i don't take bribes."
65021,Marge,this place even has its own arts district! with football-hating intellectuals!
56832,Marge,"so, how are you, mrs. krabappel?"
56833,Marge,"moe, i've never seen you here before."
65026,Marge,and i wouldn't blame him. you destroyed our son's self-esteem.
56835,Marge,whoa!
65033,Marge,homer! homer!
65036,Marge,"dr. zander, what happened?"
65037,Marge,those are pieces of broken glass.
56848,Marge,"oh, that's it. i'm gonna write you a ticket."
65040,Marge,"so whatever you did to my husband, it was too effective!"
56851,Marge,you have the right to remain silent...
65050,Marge,what?! what? what will we eat?
65052,Marge,"so, that's why lisa excused herself a few minutes ago."
65054,Marge,"i'm sorry, fat tony. my husband doesn't realize what he's saying, then, five seconds later:"
56863,Marge,"bart, you've graffito-tagged public property."
65056,Marge,excuse me. we can't find our seats. marge and homer simpson.
56865,Marge,"oh, homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?"
56868,Marge,"this is a springfield isotopes cap. when you wear it, you're wearing springfield. when you eat a fish from our river, you're eating springfield. when you make lemonade from our trees you're drinking springfield."
56871,Marge,"where you going, bart?"
65065,Marge,i will!
56876,Marge,"this is my fault. i tried to teach bart about town pride, but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness."
65074,Marge,"well, homer and i are going to take you away right now."
65078,Marge,"in a good marriage, you never say i told you so."
65079,Marge,"homer, thanks to your unlicensed barbery, patty and selma have been getting compliments all day at the dmv."
65081,Marge,"i'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. but i never knew you were so good with hair."
65087,Marge,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, julio is my little secret! i've said too much!"
65091,Marge,we've gotta get her out of there! babies aren't supposed to sleep on their stomach on a cake!
65095,Marge,"homer, stop him!"
65097,Marge,...and these are from sardine cans your father opened. he saved them out of sentimental value.
65103,Marge,uh-oh.
56914,Marge,"homie, this is so sweet. but i can't possibly go now... the sink is full of dirty dishes, the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess..."
56916,Marge,don't do that!
56918,Marge,"this is so relaxing. homie, this was a wonderful idea."
65114,Marge,so we're going to let the internet decide. should ned and edna stay together? visit thesimpsons.com and vote.
65115,Marge,we'll announce the results in next year's season premiere. probably at the end so you'll watch the whole thing.
56924,Marge,parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times...
65119,Marge,thank you! this is my third favorite reality cooking show!
56928,Marge,"we've always tried to be good parents. please, i'm begging you, one mother to another -- you must have a family."
56929,Marge,it's maggie!
65121,Marge,i put a slice of apple in it!
56931,Marge,this is so humiliating.
65127,Marge,"kids, can i talk to wayne alone a minute?"
56940,Marge,we missed you so much!
65132,Marge,how did that happen?
65133,Marge,how about living on a train that's always moving?
65134,Marge,wait! i know a place you can go! a place where a sadistic man with government experience can feel right at home.
56944,Marge,"so, what was it like at the flanders' house?"
65135,Marge,"wow -- the gym ropes are seaweed, the basketball nets are fishing nets..."
65142,Marge,"okay handsome, that's enough primping!"
65143,Marge,just because you've had a little setback doesn't mean you can't look your best.
65147,Marge,"homer, have you noticed how many of your enemies have died lately? mr. burns, sideshow bob..."
56956,Marge,you're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there.
65148,Marge,"patty and selma?! who's next, ned flanders?"
65149,Marge,what happened?!
65150,Marge,but you're god. couldn't you make everything the way it was?
65159,Marge,the jars are full -- so you've earned your... saturday surprise dad day!
56969,Marge,"homer, you're not not talking to me. and secondly, i heard what you said."
65162,Marge,"how come they never call me ""fun mom?"""
65163,Marge,"it's not fair. moms want to be fun, but we're stuck with all the... mom stuff."
65166,Marge,your saturday surprise mom day is... the x-games!
65168,Marge,"you're right, you're right, you're right -- let's go."
56977,Marge,"kids, it's time we told you the true story and put your fears to rest. it's a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave."
56979,Marge,homer? get ready. patty and selma will be here any minute.
65175,Marge,they're using pancakes as spoons!
65181,Marge,what's the craziest thing on the menu?
56990,Marge,"hi. ah, er, there's something i've been meaning to ask you. did you put on a little weight this week?"
65183,Marge,"okay marge, you test drove a convertible once, you can do this."
56992,Marge,"oh please, i would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--"
56994,Marge,"i'd like to, honey, but i'm not sure how. your father can be surprisingly sensitive. remember when i giggled at his sherlock holmes hat? he sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency."
56998,Marge,con: you're endangering your health.
65191,Marge,"don't be so jealous, homie, just because the kids are finally having fun doing something with me."
65192,Marge,of what?
65197,Marge,"ooo, triple spicy barbequed stingray stuffed with pig organs!"
57006,Marge,bart!
65200,Marge,it's my dream!
57009,Marge,"that's ridiculous. homer's not dead, he's right out back in the hammock."
65202,Marge,but there weren't four musketeers...
65204,Marge,"oh, i doubt it. you sit at communal tables, full of hipsters."
65209,Marge,don't you judge me.
57025,Marge,yeah.
57026,Marge,"this year, i'm making earplugs out of biscuit dough!"
65221,Marge,"ooo kids, did you hear that lesson?"
57030,Marge,"well, maybe my headache will go away once the show starts."
57031,Marge,do they have to play that rock music?! every note is pounding into my skull!
65222,Marge,what? they've got a point.
57033,Marge,"kids, everything's going to be okay! don't panic! just don't panic!"
65224,Marge,"i know you're hurting, but that's no reason to lash out at me."
65229,Marge,hel-lo.
57039,Marge,"oh, my little sugar-bug... i'm so glad you're safe..."
65236,Marge,...but my husband's acting pretty odd. coming home late. drinking in the morning.
65240,Marge,i'm a happily married woman!
57051,Marge,go on maggie.
65244,Marge,"homer, i want you to come with me and the kids on a family vacation."
65245,Marge,the farthest thing from this office i know: rafting down rattler river canyon.
57060,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey, but those games cost up to and including seventy dollars. and they're violent and they distract you from your schoolwork."
57061,Marge,tuck-in time!
65252,Marge,"kids, that's enough tv. maggie's eye is starting to wander."
65257,Marge,"so, what was everyone's favorite moment at the museum?"
57066,Marge,--- you're gonna get...
65259,Marge,"annie, would you ever consider taking krusty back as a client?"
57069,Marge,"bart, get your suit on."
65263,Marge,we tried that last year!
57072,Marge,"ahh, my teapots are ready."
57074,Marge,what's the matter with your face? is that a fake nose? are you wearing chin putty?
57076,Marge,uh-oh. almost forgot to lock the doors.
65269,Marge,"don't open it, homie! it's a virus!"
57082,Marge,that's crazy! bart's not a shoplifter! he's just a little boy!
65275,Marge,i just got a b-mail from maggie -- she's gone into labor!
57084,Marge,fine. play the tape. then everyone can see you've got the wrong boy.
57085,Marge,"oh, bart."
65281,Marge,i told you not to pack them!
57091,Marge,"i always thought i understood my special little guy. but somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine."
65293,Marge,my daughter's a vegetarian.
65295,Marge,"homie, wake up."
65300,Marge,homie! stop watching the movie in the other people's car!
65302,Marge,someone thinks we're leaving. i'll wave them off.
57113,Marge,all right.
65315,Marge,come on in!
57131,Marge,no.
65324,Marge,my pleasure.
65325,Marge,"...i want you to have a fun night doing guy stuff. don't worry about me, i'll be fine."
65326,Marge,i just think we should do things every day to show our love for each other.
65327,Marge,"it's okay, homie. go. have a good time. take bart with you!"
65328,Marge,"lisa, i love spending mother-daughter time with you. we have so much in common, like... um... oh no! someone's about to put the thousand island ladle into the vinaigrette!"
65329,Marge,don't panic. this can be separated out. quick! does anyone have a centrifuge?!
65333,Marge,now there's three of you?
65334,Marge,"""she had now come to the part that peter pan hated. 'i do like a mother's love,' said tootles..."""
65339,Marge,"oh, my. i don't know if anyone's ever kissed my hand before."
65342,Marge,lisa!
57156,Marge,we're not poor.
57158,Marge,"ohhh. i've always dreamed of coming here. everybody keep smiling, and i know we're going fit right in."
57160,Marge,"oh, that reminds me of a funny apron i saw..."
65356,Marge,thank you.
65357,Marge,that was the last springfield radio station. now we just get shelbyville talk radio.
57167,Marge,"why thank you, roberta."
57171,Marge,"i really need to concentrate on this, lisa, would you mind--"
57177,Marge,"mmm, it's a bit peppery for me. why don't we put this in the ""maybe"" pile."
57179,Marge,miss... miss! do you have a chanel suit or any other high-quality clothes?
57181,Marge,"no, i can't. c'mon, let's go."
65374,Marge,"now, last but not least, your present, homie."
57183,Marge,call it fate. let's go...
65376,Marge,please don't say one again.
57185,Marge,without. let me go!
57186,Marge,why do you have to question everything i do?!!
65379,Marge,i think that's enough birthday fun.
65380,Marge,"homie, have you seen our stencil budget for this month?"
57192,Marge,"don't worry, i saved the receipt. we'll have a $3,300 credit at chanel."
65384,Marge,why? are you going to do the laundry?
65388,Marge,he's a baby with wings!
57197,Marge,tacos! public broadcasting! i won't have you kids throwing your money away like that. you're both coming downtown with me and you're gonna put that money in the bank.
65389,Marge,that's just not doing it for me.
57199,Marge,you'll feel better knowing your money's in the hands of professionals.
57200,Marge,a professional in an ape mask is still a professional.
65390,Marge,"professor frink, are you all right?"
65393,Marge,...so we can go inside homer's sleeping mind and find out why he's wetting the bed.
65395,Marge,it's death! i recognize him from fortieth-birthday cards!
57204,Marge,on the street in your mind.
57209,Marge,"lisa, honey, when my family first came to this state, they had a choice of living in springfield or stenchburg. you know why they chose springfield? because everyone knows jebediah springfield was a true american hero. end of story."
57210,Marge,"boy, it sure would be fun to carpool in one of those, huh, kids? i'd be a real hot-rod mama, wouldn't i? huh? huh?"
65404,Marge,"case closed! now, let's return our dream skis."
65406,Marge,and maybe you'll stop overeating too!
65411,Marge,homie! you're home early!
65412,Marge,"well, we're having brunch with my sisters..."
65413,Marge,and you and i were going to study the municipal voter's guide.
57234,Marge,"that's not a leather muppet, that's troy mcclure. oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob!"
65428,Marge,homer!
65430,Marge,it means use the treadmill for running or take it back!
57240,Marge,"what?!! oh, my god!"
65432,Marge,on the ground!
57244,Marge,"well, there you go."
57247,Marge,"of course! of course! i would never, ever have thought of that!"
57248,Marge,"the national grammar rodeo! i wish i were going. oh, wait, wait -- i mean, i wish i was going. is that right, bart?"
57249,Marge,"oh, honey, you've had your glory. now it's bart's turn."
65442,Marge,"homie, come in the bedroom."
57255,Marge,"hello? oh, hello, principal skinner... no, bart has never been to hong kong... goodnight."
57256,Marge,"hello? tennessee state police? no, my son's car was not crushed in knoxville. i don't know where to begin telling you what's wrong with that."
57257,Marge,"hello? no, bart is not available tomorrow to deliver a human kidney to amsterdam!"
57267,Marge,bart's room.
57271,Marge,uh-huh.
65463,Marge,there is no virus! bart faked the whole thing with a dvd! a direct-to-video dvd!
57275,Marge,"but apu, the vote on proposition 24 is tuesday. you'll have to pass the test before then."
65472,Marge,not in the mood.
65475,Marge,just zip it!
57284,Marge,this is so exciting. last time i got to go backstage was when bart ripped his pants at the christmas play.
65477,Marge,homie's been working so hard i thought i'd bring him a special lunch.
57286,Marge,cannons are designed to hurt. they're designed to hurt.
57289,Marge,"am i cool, kids?"
65486,Marge,"so, how many more weeks do you have off?"
57299,Marge,"it's called little pwagmattasquarmsettport. it's known as ""america's scrod-basket."""
65491,Marge,homer!
57301,Marge,that was thoughtful.
57302,Marge,put food in me.
65492,Marge,"enough with the voting. ned, edna, why didn't you tell us?"
65496,Marge,it's extreme enough for me when they smear the wedding cake on each other's faces.
57307,Marge,"oh, okay."
65501,Marge,"so, how do the boys like springfield elementary?"
57310,Marge,oh... okay.
65502,Marge,time for cake! let's finish this sucker up.
57314,Marge,"you got ""the dud!"""
57316,Marge,i don't think you should. let lisa be alone with her new friends.
57317,Marge,"oh, you haven't said that in four years. let lisa have it."
57324,Marge,"three! we have three kids, homer!"
57326,Marge,"yes, doctor, it's what we've always feared: it's loose. hugo is loose. see you soon."
57331,Marge,lisa! breakfast! we're having waffles!
65526,Marge,"bart, that's sweet, but we'd need airplane money, hotel money..."
57335,Marge,ow! i don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a planet i never even heard of.
65535,Marge,"no! for details, log onto thesimpsons.com."
53252,Ned Flanders,everything but the opinion page! i don't need to be told what to think... by anyone living!
53255,Ned Flanders,"oh, we're not as well-off as you think. we give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. and the leftorium's business has gone way downhill since leftopolis moved in next door."
53260,Ned Flanders,i think i'm gonna be sick.
53263,Ned Flanders,"now for a regular cigarette, to make the night complete. oh! man, that's good."
53269,Ned Flanders,phew.
53270,Ned Flanders,looks like it. run get daddy's exorcism tongs.
53277,Ned Flanders,i'm making record time on this fog walk!
53279,Ned Flanders,yeah...
53287,Ned Flanders,"well, if i were a member, we could use my rumpus room as our lair."
53289,Ned Flanders,i move we reconsider our club name. make it something a little less blasphemous. after all we don't want to go to hell.
53291,Ned Flanders,the chri... i-i-i don't think you understand my objection...
53293,Ned Flanders,well i... okay.
53295,Ned Flanders,"hi-didly-ho, schuss in boots."
53298,Ned Flanders,"feels like i'm wearin' nothin' at all. nothin' at all, nothin' at all..."
53300,Ned Flanders,"maude, come quick! the simpsons are covered with cooties!"
53306,Ned Flanders,"ooh, that smarts. boys, get the alcohol-free alcohol."
53311,Ned Flanders,"yes, son."
53318,Ned Flanders,"oh, thank you, apu."
53323,Ned Flanders,"homer, this really isn't necessary..."
53325,Ned Flanders,i just bought that...
53331,Ned Flanders,hmm.
53336,Ned Flanders,homer!
53345,Ned Flanders,"well, i..."
53353,Ned Flanders,"no, i'm not kidding. i am gonna sit right here and miss church. you just watch."
53354,Ned Flanders,sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry...
53372,Ned Flanders,i'd see 'em sittin' on that couch all day long... just starin' at that hollywood hogwash.
53373,Ned Flanders,"hey, uh, careful, boys. that arch is lookin' a little romanesque."
53374,Ned Flanders,"homer, it's neddy. i baked you a little something to ease the pain."
53376,Ned Flanders,"ah, you're busy. catch you later, compu-tater."
53383,Ned Flanders,"why, there's my name in gold."
53385,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm all for rescuing the kids, but i wish you hadn't sawed off my roof."
53390,Ned Flanders,"catchy song, all right. you really wrote it?"
53395,Ned Flanders,now let's go save those kids.
53403,Ned Flanders,"jeepers, that's sugary, even for my taste."
53405,Ned Flanders,"well, in that case... my neighbor homer released a radioactive ape in my house. it's ah, it's taken over the whole top floor."
53411,Ned Flanders,will do.
53415,Ned Flanders,son of a diddly!
53419,Ned Flanders,"thank you, homer."
53423,Ned Flanders,"oh, how horrible!"
53433,Ned Flanders,this should keep you toasty.
53434,Ned Flanders,"mmm... i love chenille, don't you?"
53439,Ned Flanders,yea-- what?
53443,Ned Flanders,"maude's old sketch book. she was quite the little artist, you know."
53445,Ned Flanders,"praiseland? rides, food, a tithing pond."
53446,Ned Flanders,you're right.
53448,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, that's a nice thought, toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
53449,Ned Flanders,but where do you put something that big?
53471,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, you want me to stamp your hand so you can get back in?"
53473,Ned Flanders,"oh, maude, i turned your dream of a christian amusement park into a bemusement park."
53475,Ned Flanders,"i'm sorry, sweetheart. oh, please don't look at me like that."
53476,Ned Flanders,it's almost like she's alive again.
53487,Ned Flanders,i'm sure.
53488,Ned Flanders,"so, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night?"
53491,Ned Flanders,"it's gonna be one wholesome evening. so, do you think marge could take care of rowdy roddy and typhoon todd?"
53498,Ned Flanders,me? okay.
53502,Ned Flanders,you're using my table saw to violate a court order?
53508,Ned Flanders,"my satan sense is tingling! into the root cellar, boys!"
53514,Ned Flanders,"oh, we've got a real shower upstairs."
53517,Ned Flanders,ooh. who wants to hold mommy's hair?
53531,Ned Flanders,i guess that could be arranged.
53532,Ned Flanders,...the grace of the lord jesus be with god's people. the end.
53535,Ned Flanders,thank you so much.
53540,Ned Flanders,the camptown ladies sing this song...
53542,Ned Flanders,that's better.
53550,Ned Flanders,"i'm with you, homer."
53552,Ned Flanders,"well, i do miss the mrs..."
53553,Ned Flanders,maude! you still look as pretty as the day i buried you.
53557,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer!"
53568,Ned Flanders,"praise the lord, my seat has scored!"
53571,Ned Flanders,"gosh, fifty thousand dollars? i'm donating this whole check to ""bibles for belgians."""
53580,Ned Flanders,"and rev, you'll be bunkin' with me!"
53581,Ned Flanders,"where you going, reverend? the town's that way. reverend? you're goin' the wrong way!"
53584,Ned Flanders,that's it. the whole shebang.
53587,Ned Flanders,"okay boys, this is it. the end of this sinful little suburb."
53590,Ned Flanders,"well, guess i might as well head back to my store. i've got a date with some twins: my state and federal tax forms."
53602,Ned Flanders,i've got a date with a movie star?!
53604,Ned Flanders,i need your advice. it's about a lady.
53613,Ned Flanders,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. this movie's turning into sponge bob no-pants!"
53618,Ned Flanders,the paparazzi! i thought we fooled them with our cher-crow.
53632,Ned Flanders,sure is nice to be shopping for a woman again. the last thing i bought for a lady was a casket.
53643,Ned Flanders,"well, i consulted my bible and found some verses supporting what you want to do."
53644,Ned Flanders,and a lot of verses against it.
53651,Ned Flanders,"oh, darn the luck. that sounds like the lupus fun run."
53657,Ned Flanders,i walked right into that one.
53662,Ned Flanders,"oh, i got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus."
53667,Ned Flanders,"sin of pride, roddy."
53675,Ned Flanders,"i'm dying! and there's heaven. but who's that? confucius? and milton berle? boy, have i been barkin' up the wrong tree."
53676,Ned Flanders,"oh well, you snooze you lose. but uh, can i have my photo albums back?"
53677,Ned Flanders,"well, the hobos sure will appreciate our old clothes and lima beans."
53680,Ned Flanders,"well, maybe just a tad, todd."
53681,Ned Flanders,"one problem at a time, boy."
53690,Ned Flanders,that tears it. i'll show homer. i'm gonna be the nicest man this world has ever seen.
53693,Ned Flanders,"my angle is givin' in this world, livin' in the next."
53701,Ned Flanders,"hey marge, you look like you could use a nice big stud... detector."
53704,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess it wouldn't kill me to let you in."
53705,Ned Flanders,"well, he's got me there."
53708,Ned Flanders,advice? just call me ann flanders!
53715,Ned Flanders,let's see what's goin' on vis a vis the visa.
53720,Ned Flanders,what the family circus? a second premonition came to fruition.
53721,Ned Flanders,"lord, why have you given me these unholy visions of doom?"
53728,Ned Flanders,"homer, please, don't tempt the gods. i-i mean god! there's-there's one god! only one! well, sometimes there's three."
53731,Ned Flanders,"i was supposed to shoot you, but i didn't! i changed the future!"
53736,Ned Flanders,homer! homer!
53739,Ned Flanders,don't do it! don't do it! you'll kill everyone!
53741,Ned Flanders,must... kill... best friend.
53742,Ned Flanders,"homer, fall backward!"
53745,Ned Flanders,"marge, you know i thought i was springfield's wing ding king, but uh, you make my chicken look like cock-a-diddily doo doo."
53746,Ned Flanders,"you know i was gonna enter this here ovenfresh bakeoff... but up against you, i wouldn't have a hindu's chance in heaven."
53772,Ned Flanders,"now, there's no need to actually whip 'em. we can put the sound in later."
53784,Ned Flanders,"sorry, homer. you'll have to call me a ray-theist, 'cause i don't believe i saw him."
53787,Ned Flanders,"well, well, well, looks like someone's having a pre-rapture party."
53790,Ned Flanders,"all right, neighbor, i'll baby-sit."
53799,Ned Flanders,"well, i'd love to help you out, but you do have to be over eighteen."
53804,Ned Flanders,"well, thank you."
53811,Ned Flanders,get out!
53825,Ned Flanders,you know what? i'm not gonna. my mustache has the right to life -- it's my body and my choice!
53827,Ned Flanders,why? so you can make me a laughingstock again?
53828,Ned Flanders,"well, that is true. in fact--"
53834,Ned Flanders,homer!
53842,Ned Flanders,he's right. can't we all get together and concentrate on our real enemies: monogamous gays and stem cells?
53847,Ned Flanders,really? do you mind if i bring my boys over so she can infect rod and todd? then there'll be a pox on both our houses!
53850,Ned Flanders,"well, they might. but you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors..."
53858,Ned Flanders,aagh! paper cut!
53873,Ned Flanders,"hey, you're welcome to see the dynamic duo any time."
53875,Ned Flanders,what are you doing?! you're gonna get hurt!
53880,Ned Flanders,"and so we don't have another disaster, you crawl up those steps!"
53884,Ned Flanders,he chipped a tooth! how will he bite wheat thins? how?
53887,Ned Flanders,now i'll lay down some astro turf / so they don't scrape their n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-knees...
53897,Ned Flanders,please! somebody take 'em!
53901,Ned Flanders,"tell you what -- if we turn around, it'll feel like we're at the front of the line!"
53902,Ned Flanders,"you're leavin' already? we, we haven't even gotten in yet."
53909,Ned Flanders,they're telling people we're descended from a pack of apes. even though there's nothing about it in the bible!
53914,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm tryin' to..."
53917,Ned Flanders,"let's go, boys. your poor old popsicle's been licked."
53920,Ned Flanders,whaa -- ?
53923,Ned Flanders,"hiddily-ho, blobareeno."
53924,Ned Flanders,"marge, i hate to interrupt the ol' solilo-diddly-iloquy, but i just want to thank you for your early christmas card."
53930,Ned Flanders,"he's the kindest, sweetest most generous man ever to drive through my living room."
53931,Ned Flanders,"oh, i wish! no, these are complimentary boxes from the shipping company."
53952,Ned Flanders,"you know what they say: ""with great power comes great responsibility."""
53956,Ned Flanders,just get in there!
53958,Ned Flanders,"no, the lesson here is he's being punished for thinking women are beautiful."
53961,Ned Flanders,springfield is rife with the seven deadly sins! starting with... gluttony!
53979,Ned Flanders,"listen sheriff, i can help you take down bonnie and clyde."
53982,Ned Flanders,not me!
53986,Ned Flanders,ow! what was that for?
53991,Ned Flanders,even the sing-alongs?
53994,Ned Flanders,"young man, what would your mother say if she knew you were shooting nice people in the brain?"
53997,Ned Flanders,now i can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
54000,Ned Flanders,"well... i could use money. but you have to promise me something, homer."
54010,Ned Flanders,i like their christian cover band: a.d.-b.c.! kindly deeds / done for free / kindly deeds
54013,Ned Flanders,hm. i've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.
54018,Ned Flanders,"homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! you need a special sticker just to bring a bike! have you no respect for the law?"
54019,Ned Flanders,"homer, no! you promised... everything was supposed to be by the book!"
54020,Ned Flanders,this partnership is over!
54022,Ned Flanders,"lucky jim, i'm out of the bounty hunting business."
54024,Ned Flanders,homer!
54025,Ned Flanders,not interested.
54027,Ned Flanders,"you jumped bail, homer. i gotta bring you in."
54038,Ned Flanders,"and in that mud, i'm plantin' the seed of friendship. name's ned flanders!"
54040,Ned Flanders,"put 'er there, muddy buddy."
54044,Ned Flanders,since two this afternoon. welcome to our honeymoon!
54049,Ned Flanders,"sweet dreams, my new best friend."
54060,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, maybe i could use a break from the ol' weed 'n' feed."
54061,Ned Flanders,three... two... one... it's ash wednesday everybody! set down your gins and confess your sins!
54067,Ned Flanders,"try 'er now, marge."
54095,Ned Flanders,iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily...
54100,Ned Flanders,"reverend, care for some of my devils food cake?"
54115,Ned Flanders,naw.
54120,Ned Flanders,seen the paper?
54123,Ned Flanders,"you know, maybe i should use a towel marked ""b.d.d."" -- big diddily deal!"
54124,Ned Flanders,i play that fight over in my mind a thousand times a day.
54127,Ned Flanders,"now let's start with the words everyone loves to hear: ""welcome to bible study!"""
54146,Ned Flanders,"homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?"
54155,Ned Flanders,"and lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin. and thank you, again, for the challenge of homer simpson... we've all got our crosses to bear. me homer, you the cross. and now, let me gaze with reverence upon the holy resting place of..."
54165,Ned Flanders,"it's because i believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. at least i thought so till now. homer simpson, you are not worth saving."
54167,Ned Flanders,nothing like a tall glass of luke-warm water to jekyll down this hyde.
54171,Ned Flanders,i'd like that.
54173,Ned Flanders,okily dokily.
54185,Ned Flanders,"mm-hmm! now i'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. tsk, tsk, tsk."
54192,Ned Flanders,"inspiration point looks pretty uninspired... all's quiet in murder town... yep, springfield is cleaner than the lord's hand towels."
54196,Ned Flanders,"rod? hold up daddy's shaving mirror out the window, would ya?"
54199,Ned Flanders,i'm standin' right here!
54201,Ned Flanders,i guess i did create this... like god created the devil.
54206,Ned Flanders,"neighbor, marge invited me over to be the little angel on your shoulder, so you wouldn't listen to the four hundred devils on the other."
54211,Ned Flanders,"yup, that's exactly... oh, you almost got me."
54212,Ned Flanders,not on my watch!
54216,Ned Flanders,"in the last game, our shortstop hit a long foul ball, but the umpire called it a homerun... and i let it go without saying a word. i just don't like the monster i've become."
54218,Ned Flanders,"hey there, mr. burns! for our half hour i thought we'd have a picnic in the park."
54223,Ned Flanders,"well, maybe your kids didn't."
54224,Ned Flanders,"well, i got excited for nothing."
54227,Ned Flanders,"oh, isn't that a cute little choo-choo..."
54232,Ned Flanders,"okay, ms. krabappel, what made you topple?"
54248,Ned Flanders,"but i think if we hold off for a while, you'll find i'm well worth the wait. like a mild cheddar i get tangy when i'm sittin' on the shelf."
54258,Ned Flanders,"i don't wanna come here. last time i did, someone slipped me a mickey and wrote ""churchy joe"" on my face."
54263,Ned Flanders,"that's right. and like any man, i put on my secret christian underpants one leg at a time."
54270,Ned Flanders,maybe we should just call it a night.
54279,Ned Flanders,spend less time on your back and more time on your knees.
54285,Ned Flanders,"heavenly father, i..."
54325,Ned Flanders,but-but-but...
54326,Ned Flanders,"well, congratulations, homer. guess this is just my cross to bear."
54336,Ned Flanders,"no, but i'm sure newt gingrich wouldn't steer us wrong."
54341,Ned Flanders,less news from the pews!
54342,Ned Flanders,"okay simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause i think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun."
54346,Ned Flanders,"well, sir... when we got married, i knew i'd find some spices in my chili. i guess they can go to springfield hellementary."
54355,Ned Flanders,"edna, i'm sorry and i'll say it in front of god or groundskeeper willie!"
54358,Ned Flanders,"first base, yo! / i like christian rap / a bible on my lap..."
54360,Ned Flanders,"well, hello! it's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night."
54361,Ned Flanders,"name's ned flanders, i've heard of you. haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm."
54366,Ned Flanders,homer! is that my camera?
54369,Ned Flanders,asterisk-pound sign-at sign-exclamation point!
54372,Ned Flanders,"oh, i will! till i go to bed and take 'em off under the covers! but come outside and see the miracle!"
54375,Ned Flanders,look a little closer.
54376,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, if you ask me, somebody up there is trying to tell you that whatever flat tires you've got in your life, god's there, with his little spare, that enables you to drive real slow till you get to the next station."
54377,Ned Flanders,don't eat the miracle!
54380,Ned Flanders,"yes, but there's two sides to every--"
54382,Ned Flanders,mind if i come over and sweeten your greetin'. sweeten your greetin'! sweeten your greetin'!
54396,Ned Flanders,that's cross-legged music!
54397,Ned Flanders,homer! i can't believe you're partaking with my parents!
54400,Ned Flanders,not praying to a character in a comic book.
54415,Ned Flanders,i would embrace such a glad visit!
54419,Ned Flanders,"c'mon, homer. i'm insisting on a fisting."
54427,Ned Flanders,"my prayers have been answered! well actually, just this one."
54438,Ned Flanders,it's the parson!
54448,Ned Flanders,neither! and i don't like it when other people rhyme!
54450,Ned Flanders,can you teach my boys? but no tickling the ivories. you treat them with respect.
54451,Ned Flanders,all right! a chance to make a new friend!
54452,Ned Flanders,"hey, simpsons! don't mean to be a pesto, but i'll be happy to watch your scampy shrimp."
54458,Ned Flanders,i haven't felt this inspired since the blueberries at breakfast!
54461,Ned Flanders,"well... i'm down to a kiosk, thanks to that place."
54465,Ned Flanders,"we may be going to hell for seeing ""side bosom,"" but this backyard is a little slice of heaven, all thanks to homer simpson!"
54469,Ned Flanders,their skipping lessons are really payin' off!
54472,Ned Flanders,sure do miss that laugh.
54475,Ned Flanders,"ah, too much aggravation! we just forego flipped food!"
54476,Ned Flanders,you'll only taste the spoon!
54480,Ned Flanders,you're never bored paintin' the lord.
54483,Ned Flanders,why that's a higher power than even i believe in. what is going on?
54484,Ned Flanders,"really, really, really?"
54486,Ned Flanders,it's the name of the freezer!
54494,Ned Flanders,"oh, homer! unto us this day, a neighbor is born! but why?"
54507,Ned Flanders,"well, happy holidays, simpson."
54510,Ned Flanders,yes indeedilly-doodily.
54512,Ned Flanders,"oooh, she's a beaut. hey, congratulations, simpson. i'm sure you'll have loads of fun."
54521,Ned Flanders,"oh, your beer. uh, is draft okay? just put in the tap last week."
54529,Ned Flanders,sometimes i forget that we have things a little better than the simpsons. i drag him over here. he has a few beers. you can't blame him for erupting.
54535,Ned Flanders,"a gentle answer. well, that is a jim-dandy idea. bless you, reverend."
54537,Ned Flanders,"i don't blame you for being upset with me, homer. i just wanted to give you this letter. i'll leave now."
54538,Ned Flanders,"hi, simpson! having fun?"
54542,Ned Flanders,"good shot, toddsky!"
54549,Ned Flanders,"oh, i'm a chicken, am i?"
54554,Ned Flanders,"you have yourself a bet, you jackaninny!"
54555,Ned Flanders,"eh, eh, just a minute. ""loser"" is such a harsh word. couldn't we just say ""the boy who doesn't win""?"
54558,Ned Flanders,"actually, simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt."
54560,Ned Flanders,'fraid so.
54562,Ned Flanders,'fraid so infinity plus one.
54576,Ned Flanders,"oh, it's crying out to cook up some good eatin'."
52536,Ned Flanders,"sometimes maude, god bless her, she underlines passages in my bible because she can't find hers."
54584,Ned Flanders,"mr. universe, i wish!"
52538,Ned Flanders,"you are a picture and a half! well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. we're gonna fire up old propane elaine and put the heat to the meat! nummy nummy num!"
52542,Ned Flanders,"friends, we love you all, but i also have a ""sinister"" motive for asking you all here -- ""sinister"" being latin for ""left-handed."" but enough joking."
52545,Ned Flanders,"well sir, like one out of every nine americans, i'm left-handed. and let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. your writing gets smeared. lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."
52547,Ned Flanders,"so homer, i'm dyin' to know. what do you think of the leftorium?"
52550,Ned Flanders,"you must have something you want to wish for, homer."
52551,Ned Flanders,"come on, homer! i got an ambition to do some wishin'!"
52552,Ned Flanders,"no, no, no, don't say. otherwise it won't come true."
52554,Ned Flanders,"now, you put that money away. that was an accident."
52555,Ned Flanders,absotively posilutely.
52562,Ned Flanders,"hey, i'm flexible! you don't have to pay all at once. i'll be here all night if you change your mind."
52563,Ned Flanders,"oh, yeah. sure. thought i'd just get rid of some of the clutter. see anything you like?"
52564,Ned Flanders,"ah, got your eye on the gas grill. she's a butane beaut."
52572,Ned Flanders,"oh, oh, no, it's just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister's apartment in capital city. hey what do think, kids? the big city!"
52581,Ned Flanders,"oh, homer, there's no point..."
52582,Ned Flanders,homer?
52584,Ned Flanders,"homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. but you made us friends."
52591,Ned Flanders,hey ho simpson.
52592,Ned Flanders,"well sir, there are two schools of thought..."
52595,Ned Flanders,"well, you knew i had a temper when you married me."
52614,Ned Flanders,aren't we in luck? today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. come in my friend. let us feed and bathe you.
52615,Ned Flanders,"i think it's mom's turn, son."
52619,Ned Flanders,"hot diggity! how 'bout that, marge? li'l ol' stanley me! ""stella!"" ""stella!"" heh heh."
52621,Ned Flanders,aww... isn't that cute? and me without a camera.
52626,Ned Flanders,you're a dame and i'm a fella.
52627,Ned Flanders,all i want is one embrace.
52628,Ned Flanders,i'm trying... i'm trying...

52644,Ned Flanders,"well, howdy strangers! what can i do ya for?"
52652,Ned Flanders,"buenos dias, neighboritos. the handle's flanders, but my friends call me ned."
52661,Ned Flanders,"heidy-ho, simpson. your son shoved this through our doggie door."
52663,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson! well, if that don't put the ""dink"" in co-inky-dink."
52664,Ned Flanders,i'm having a kidney and a lung removed.
52671,Ned Flanders,my name is ned.
52672,Ned Flanders,it's been four thousand days since my last drink. it was my first and last blackberry schnapps.
52674,Ned Flanders,i was more animal than man.
52688,Ned Flanders,hey!
52690,Ned Flanders,oh my stars!
52691,Ned Flanders,"say your prayers, simpson..."
52696,Ned Flanders,isn't that nice?
52703,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, bart!"
52707,Ned Flanders,"hey now, marge. let's not ""should"" this fella to death."
52708,Ned Flanders,"well it's bart simpson! c'mon in! you're just in time for ""sponge bath the old folks day!"""
52710,Ned Flanders,"well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir."
52713,Ned Flanders,"here you go, your rubber training knife. you've attained the rank of pussy willow."
52714,Ned Flanders,"okay, kids, now i'm gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. but this should only be used in a life or death situation."
52729,Ned Flanders,"wrong, we're saved! sea gulls always stay near land. they only go out to sea to die."
52736,Ned Flanders,"that's what you're smelling, homer! oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!"
52743,Ned Flanders,"welcome, neighbors... since the police can't seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, i think it's time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni!"
52744,Ned Flanders,"now, who should lead the group?"
52745,Ned Flanders,"i don't really have very much experience, but i'll be---"
52754,Ned Flanders,"heh-heh, yeah."
52774,Ned Flanders,i -- i think i hate homer simpson.
52776,Ned Flanders,"ah, uh, homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother. family only. you know?"
52782,Ned Flanders,"i can't do it, maude. i can't face their accusing eyes."
52786,Ned Flanders,"thank you. thank you so much, homer. you really are a you're a true friend."
52790,Ned Flanders,it's the four elephants of the apocalypse!
52793,Ned Flanders,now i know everybody's eager to get back to class --
52795,Ned Flanders,"yeah, you."
52796,Ned Flanders,"well, let me just say i want to put the ""stew"" back in students."
52810,Ned Flanders,i wish there was some other explanation for this. but there isn't. i'm a murderer! i'm a murderer!
52811,Ned Flanders,i'm a murdiddly-erdiler.
52813,Ned Flanders,soon enough.
52828,Ned Flanders,"hi-de-ho-e-roonie, neighbor. what can i do you for?"
52829,Ned Flanders,"i kinda figured this might happen, so i built the shelter big enough for both our families."
52839,Ned Flanders,"que sera, sera / whatever will be, will be..."
52840,Ned Flanders,"when i was just a little girl / i asked my mother what will i be / will i be pretty, will i be rich? / here's what she said to me..."
52844,Ned Flanders,lucky i was wearing an extra large piece of the true cross today. i think i'll go inside.
52848,Ned Flanders,"'zounds, i did thee mightily smite-ly."
52867,Ned Flanders,dear lord. that's the loudest profanity i've ever heard.
52869,Ned Flanders,"heydilly-ho! welcome to your new home, neglect-areenos!"
52873,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess a little television won't hurt. i used to let the boys watch ""my three sons,"" but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime."
52874,Ned Flanders,"uh, er, that's just raspberry jam."
52878,Ned Flanders,"c'mon, you gloomy gusses. who's up for a big bowl of non-fat ice milk?"
52879,Ned Flanders,"nighty night, my sweet li'l foundling-a-dings."
52881,Ned Flanders,"babe. we got you, babe."

52898,Ned Flanders,who wants to be the first to enter god's good graces?
52901,Ned Flanders,"oh, fair enough."

52913,Ned Flanders,you know...
52920,Ned Flanders,"what the heckaroonie is this, mrs. glick?"
52923,Ned Flanders,"now, folks, nothin' spells fun like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket!"
52924,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, i'm welcoming the bushes on behalf of the neighborhood association."
52930,Ned Flanders,"thankily-dank, mayor, i shan't disappoint. har ye, har ye! i declare myself pickled tink about springfield's bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial day!"

52941,Ned Flanders,what do you need it for?
52954,Ned Flanders,"well, if god didn't make little green apples -- it's homer simpson! how long have you been here?"
52955,Ned Flanders,"oh, suckin' down the cider, eh? hey, word to the wise... season pass!"
52960,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm as permissive as the next parent. i mean, just yesterday, i let todd buy some red hots with a cartoon devil on the box. but you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
52970,Ned Flanders,ach! it was that darn recording again!
52975,Ned Flanders,howdilly-doodily...
52976,Ned Flanders,"well, need some help there? you know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker."
52977,Ned Flanders,"oh, it'll be fun. we're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. make sure we don't owe anything extra."
52978,Ned Flanders,"no, sirree, we'd be happy as hens to ha--"
52979,Ned Flanders,"okilly-dokilly. oo, i better go take down the manger scene. if baby jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
52981,Ned Flanders,maude? rod? todd?
52989,Ned Flanders,uh-huh. floor feels a little gritty here.
52990,Ned Flanders,"why me, lord? where have i gone wrong? i've always been nice to people. i don't drink or dance or swear. i've even kept kosher, just to be on the safe side. i've done everything the bible says, even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff. what more could i do? i... i feel like i'm coming apart here. i want to yell out, but i... i... i just can't dang-diddily-do-dang-do-don-diddily-darn-do it. i... i...i..."
52993,Ned Flanders,"it's wonderful. i... i... i don't know how i can possibly repay you, but if any of you ever need a favor, just look for the happiest man in springfield."
53001,Ned Flanders,do i hear the sound of butting in? it's gotta be little lisa simpson -- springfield's answer to a question no one asked!
53010,Ned Flanders,thank you. doctor foster?
53020,Ned Flanders,"oh, now, why would i be afraid of that?"
53022,Ned Flanders,"mmm, mmm. 'sure are fun to scratch. mmm. satisfying."
53023,Ned Flanders,"oh, they hum like angels. you're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light."
53029,Ned Flanders,"we'll see, son. we'll see."
53038,Ned Flanders,"well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but i have to drive to capital city, fill out some forms to get 'em out. could you possibly watch the kids tonight?"
53044,Ned Flanders,"well, if you're talking about root beer, i plead guilt-didilly-ilty as char-dardilly-arged."
53045,Ned Flanders,i'm meek... but i could probably stand to be meeker.
53047,Ned Flanders,i think i swallowed a toothpick.
53049,Ned Flanders,"yeah, well, if you're sure that'll help..."
53055,Ned Flanders,"oh, i can't see the name of the station... but the gas costs one forty-nine and eight tenths."
53060,Ned Flanders,"you saved me, reverend. you really went above and beyond. thank you!"
53063,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, i hate to be a suspicious aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?"
53064,Ned Flanders,"now, now, there's plenty of exits for everyone."
53066,Ned Flanders,"ho-ho-ho, you betcha. team sports'll keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls."
53070,Ned Flanders,"and, uh, bart, you'll be a tackle."
53074,Ned Flanders,who are we?
53081,Ned Flanders,"they're just words, neddie. words can't hurt ya."
53087,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho, i gotta say, lisa, it sounds like you're strainin' to do some explainin'."
53090,Ned Flanders,"thanks anyway, homer."

53131,Ned Flanders,"whoa! january first! better get goin' on those taxes, neddy!"
53133,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, why, everything! policemen, trees, sunshine. and let's not forget the folks who just don't feel like workin', god bless 'em."
53136,Ned Flanders,"easy, ned, don't breathe in."

53152,Ned Flanders,"thanks for the tip, homer."
53160,Ned Flanders,"and, of course, i resist all the major urges."

53209,Ned Flanders,how are we going to get outta this mess in an honorable and decent--
53215,Ned Flanders,what's the occasion?
53216,Ned Flanders,homer!
53218,Ned Flanders,what did the aliens look like?
53223,Ned Flanders,"aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. how can we sabotage his labor of love?"
53225,Ned Flanders,"whew, well, at least i got a hunk of moe's hair."
53235,Ned Flanders,"i hate to be a bossy betty, but i have to forbid you to eat its fruit."
