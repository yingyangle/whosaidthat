Speaker,Line
Bart,"Thanks, dude."
Bart,You don't have to yell!
Bart,"Whoa! Check out this bitchin' bod! Oh man, if I could just have five minutes alone with my old bullies..."
Bart,Are you guys gonna beat me up?
Bart,"C'mon, let's bond, you stupid jerk."
Bart,Maybe I'll just take a taxi.
Bart,No thanks.
Bart,The only thing that looks good on this stupid planet are the bananas.
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Hey, what gives, man?"
Bart,Don't you mean tentacles?
Bart,Aye Carumba!
Bart,So... was it okay?
Bart,"Man, back on earth we don't have so many moons."
Bart,"Uh... it's a place on the other side of this planet that's... very rainy so you can only see one moon. You know, like Portland."
Bart,"Man, you are full of surprises."
Bart,I can't believe I'm getting combat pay for this.
Bart,You said you were using birth control!
Bart,"So, where can I load up on this ""Hilarium?"""
Bart,Traitor! How dare you betray the planet I got laid on?!
Bart,"So Kamala, where do we keep all our tanks and planes and stuff?"
Bart,"Oh man, you sound like my art teacher. Look a little like her too."
Bart,I guess this is a good time to tell you I've been a double agent all this time. But now I am totally on your side.
Bart,"Yo, colonel!"
Bart,"Uh, you've got some schmutz on your cheek."
Bart,Eat my shorts! / Aye carumba!
Bart,Victory party under the slide!
Bart,"Hey, thanks for your vote, man."
Bart,"Well, you got that right. Thanks for your vote, girls."
Bart,"Well, don't sweat it. Just so long as a couple of people did... right, Milhouse?"
Bart,Lewis?
Bart,Somebody must have voted.
Bart,Uh oh.
Bart,I demand a recount.
Bart,No.
Bart,"Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can't believe it was her."
Bart,"Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted..."
Bart,No.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"Well, no."
Bart,"Hey! Thanks, monkey-man."
Bart,"Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed."
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,What?
Bart,Yes sir.
Bart,What?
Bart,What?
Bart,They're fighting in the car again.
Bart,I understand why. You were wasted.
Bart,"Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will."
Bart,Now you wanna go?
Bart,"Come back for more, eh?"
Bart,What do you need a babysitter for? I'm almost ten and a half.
Bart,"Don't take that tone with me, young lady, or I'll give you a taste of the back of me hand."
Bart,"Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this. It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do."
Bart,"After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty Burger and head for the arcade."
Bart,"Lis, in these crazy, topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or wrong? But right now my gut's telling me... Bleed Gramps dry."
Bart,Check.
Bart,Check.
Bart,Check.
Bart,"What's next, Lis?"
Bart,"Hey, Grampa. Aisle six and step on it."
Bart,"Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. We've had a big day."
Bart,"Hey Grampa, top me off."
Bart,"For the last time, yes!"
Bart,"Hey, Milhouse. Big blowout at Casa de Simpson. The only adult is frail and old."
Bart,"Milhouse, good to see you, pal. What's happening, man?"
Bart,"Not yet, but the afternoon is young."
Bart,"Lisa, what's wrong?"
Bart,"You're great at a party, Lisa. Really great."
Bart,"Yeah, take care, man. Hey, thanks for coming. Hey, nice tie, Nelson.."
Bart,"Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant feeling I've never had before."
Bart,"Well, how do you make this feeling go away?"
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,I'll never trust another old person.
Bart,Wow! Number nine! That's before Fallout Boy became his ward.
Bart,What do you care about good comics? All you ever buy is Casper the Wimpy Ghost.
Bart,"Well, you know what I think? I think Casper's the ghost of Richie Rich."
Bart,I wonder how Richie died?
Bart,"Now, Radioactive Man: He rules! Never punches a bad guy without saying something cool."
Bart,"Oh, yeah? Look. He knocks a guy into the sun and says, ""Hot enough for ya?"""
Bart,This looks like a discount for...
Bart,Bartman!
Bart,I'm Bartman!
Bart,Lousy rip off...
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,"Hey, Otto-man! Oooh, what's that?"
Bart,Cool!
Bart,The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV?
Bart,"Wow, I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam."
Bart,"Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Over here, Fallout Boy! Oh, oh, me... me... me... me, me."
Bart,Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his bullet-riddled body was found?
Bart,Wow. Radioactive Man Number One.
Bart,I bet it's worth a million bucks!
Bart,All I got is thirty.
Bart,"But I must. Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know... to buy that comic book."
Bart,"All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger!"
Bart,I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
Bart,"Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world."
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,Please Dad.
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Aw, Mom, I couldn't ask you to do that. You're already taking care of Maggie, and Lisa is such a handful --"
Bart,Me?
Bart,Uh... nothing.
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY... AHH
Bart,Empty bottles... empty bottles...
Bart,"Hm... well, it's practically empty."
Bart,"Here you go, Apu."
Bart,"No, not today. I need the dime."
Bart,Ah-ha!
Bart,"Americanize this, my good man."
Bart,All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
Bart,"Oh, this is so humiliating... I feel like such a geek."
Bart,"Terrible. Cars slow down to laugh at me, but no one's buying."
Bart,Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Let's see... ... Ah!
Bart,"Form a line, no crowding. Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear... Step right up."
Bart,Beat it.
Bart,"Ugh, my dog ate it."
Bart,Say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. How about a couple on the house?
Bart,"So long, officers. Uh-oh."
Bart,Mrs. Glick?
Bart,"No, thanks. Who's that?"
Bart,"No, thanks."
Bart,"Oh, yes, ma'am!"
Bart,"Ugh, I think I'd rather just get to work, Ma'am."
Bart,All of 'em?
Bart,Ow!. . .Ow!
Bart,Finished.
Bart,"Listen, lady, you don't have to -- YAAAUUUUGGGHHH!"
Bart,"Hi, Mom."
Bart,"Not yet, but at least I'm in a lot of pain."
Bart,There's a reason.
Bart,"I'll sludge you, you old bat."
Bart,"Some old lady thing, nobody's heard about for fifty years?"
Bart,"Great story, lady."
Bart,Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms.
Bart,"No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH!"
Bart,Two quarters?
Bart,Two quarters!
Bart,"Listen lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can leave without saying a bad word, but there's no way that I am saying thank you."
Bart,"Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her..."
Bart,"I've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents."
Bart,Really?
Bart,"Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps."
Bart,Can I have it for thirty-five?
Bart,"Wait a minute, Martin. If you, Milhouse and I went in together, we could buy a copy of ""Radioactive Man No. 1"" right now!"
Bart,"Look, pal. We've got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy ""Radioactive Man No. 1"". So why don't you just waddle over there and get it."
Bart,"Wow! Breathe it in, boys!"
Bart,"Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home."
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,Now you know better.
Bart,"Listen, you guys are welcome to come over and read it any time you like."
Bart,Your house? That's crazy talk!
Bart,Perfect.
Bart,Yeah. What about Sunday?
Bart,Perfect.
Bart,Yeah! What about zero?
Bart,"Uh, uh, uh, ah nice try, Martin. It almost worked. But tonight, this comic book stays right here."
Bart,"Fine. We're all going to stay here with the comic book. It'll be like a sleep-over. Yeah, a sleep-over. That's what pals do, right? Real friendly-like."
Bart,"Nice try, mister."
Bart,"What do you mean, the last one alive?"
Bart,"Yeah, sure you did."
Bart,"I knew it. You're both against me! Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholemew J. Simpson."
Bart,"Sweet dreams, boys."
Bart,One more step and you're a dead man.
Bart,"Yeah, right, so do I, but you don't see me gettin' up."
Bart,Our dear friend Martin was trying to steal the comic book.
Bart,"Hmp, impressive."
Bart,"Quiet, Piggy, or we'll stick an apple in your mouth. We can't take any chances. We'll have to take turns watching him."
Bart,"Oh, so that's your little game. Let old Bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!"
Bart,"Well, it is not going to happen, see?"
Bart,"Hey Martin, tell him what we do with squealers."
Bart,The hell I can't!
Bart,"Milhouse, it's not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit."
Bart,Shut up! Shut up!
Bart,"Aw, Mom."
Bart,We worked so hard and now it's all gone... We ended up with nothing because the three of us can't share.
Bart,Nothing. It just kind of ticks me off.
Bart,How many teeth do I have?
Bart,Allergies.
Bart,And?
Bart,"Hey, wait a minute. I don't have to give blood. I have rights, you know."
Bart,Is it a Bible story?
Bart,How did a lion get rich?
Bart,Oh.
Bart,"Whoa, Otto-man! You work here?"
Bart,"Yeah, Mom. We got hosed!"
Bart,You stink.
Bart,An elephant's butt?
Bart,Yup.
Bart,The last place I saw it...
Bart,...was in my hand...
Bart,...as I was shoving it into the mailbox.
Bart,"Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You're an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. So I..."
Bart,"Give it up, Homer. It's locked up tight."
Bart,"Why the hose, Homer?"
Bart,"Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?"
Bart,"Dad, the mailman is here."
Bart,"No, I mean the mailman's here."
Bart,"They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it."
Bart,"Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch."
Bart,Wow! A crowbar!
Bart,Wow! A big ugly head!
Bart,Awesome!
Bart,"Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head."
Bart,"Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool!"
Bart,Lisa? It's six a.m. Something's wrong! Dad died!
Bart,"Well, what do you know? I'm relieved."
Bart,"Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore --"
Bart,Lisa did it.
Bart,"Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he?"
Bart,"Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! I'm doing it! Birthday gift coming your way!"
Bart,Can do.
Bart,Hm... Krusty hotline.
Bart,I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
Bart,"Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!"
Bart,LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY /
Bart,"Dad, maybe you should do this."
Bart,"Oh, yeah."
Bart,"Hey, Dad. ""Do you hear voices?"""
Bart,"Yes. ""Are you quick to anger?"""
Bart,"Yes. ""Do you wet your pants?"" Well, even the best of us has an occasional accident."
Bart,HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA /
Bart,"Hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. You got it, sis."
Bart,"Joe's Crematorium. You kill 'em, we grill 'em."
Bart,"I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?"
Bart,The Michael Jackson? No way!
Bart,Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you?
Bart,"Aw, come on. If you're really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys?"
Bart,"Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives?"
Bart,"Well, there's probably a down-size I don't see. Uh-huh... New Bedlam Asylum... loves us... needs us... fears he may never see us again... Got it... Michael Jackson. Whoo-hoo! I love you, man."
Bart,"Hey Mom, Dad's in a mental institution."
Bart,"No, mom, you said poor house."
Bart,Poor house.
Bart,Poor house.
Bart,"Joe's Taxidermy. You snuff 'em, we stuff 'em."
Bart,"Homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose."
Bart,"Yes Dad, I solemnly swear I will not tell another living soul... No, not even Milhouse."
Bart,"Hello, Milhouse? Can you keep a secret?"
Bart,"Oh well, who cares. Michael Jackson is coming to my house!"
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,Huh?
Bart,"You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask."
Bart,Hey... you.
Bart,I WISH YOU BETTER THAN YOUR HEART DESIRE /
Bart,Stiffed 'em?
Bart,I can't write a song. I'm only ten.
Bart,"Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what Michael Jackson looks like. You look like a big fat mental patient."
Bart,Just leave me alone.
Bart,"Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the piano and I'll boil some coffee."
Bart,"LISA, HER TEETH ARE BIG AND GREEN / LISA, SHE SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE / LISA, DA DA DA DEESA / SHE IS MY SIS-TA, HER BIRTHDAY I MISSED-TA."
Bart,I don't have any.
Bart,That's cause she knows you're looking at her.
Bart,"Well, your training wheels come off your bike."
Bart,You're just putting that in because it's commercial.
Bart,Lisa... Lisa... Lisa.
Bart,"That's right! Hope you like your present. And a-one, and a-two, and a one, two, three, four --"
Bart,HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA /

Bart,LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA...
Bart,"Hey, what gives, man?"
Bart,"Wow, little meatloaf men!"
Bart,"Mom, it's a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on."
Bart,Oh baby!
Bart,"No thank you, I'd rather push this button."
Bart,"Hey, I call first bedsies!"
Bart,"Well, okay, which one do you want?"
Bart,"Really, you want that one? It's all yours. Whatever you say."
Bart,"Nothing! Have a good night's sleep, Lisa."
Bart,Nothing.
Bart,Nothing.
Bart,Good morning. This is your wake-up call.
Bart,Sorry fatso.
Bart,"""On this spot, Richard Nixon bowled back-to back-300 games."""
Bart,"Rudy my man, you're a miracle worker."
Bart,There you go... buy yourself something nice.
Bart,"Before you kill me, remember, this trip is ""All Expenses Paid."""
Bart,"Oh, this guy is awful."
Bart,Cool! A ruckus!
Bart,He already sang this song!
Bart,Cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool...
Bart,"Lis, you taught me to stand up for what I believe in."
Bart,"You're ""it""!"
Bart,No electricity. Electricity only in freeze tag.
Bart,"Yeah, you cheater!"
Bart,Six. Seven if there's something good on.
Bart,"Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?"
Bart,"Hey Mom, how 'bout if I learn karate? Will that we make you happy?"
Bart,"Um, excuse me, sir. I already know how not to hit a guy. Can we break out the nunchucks?"
Bart,"Akira, my good man. When do we break blocks of ice with our heads?"
Bart,"Yo, sensei, can I go to the bathroom?"
Bart,Paying money to read books... the hell with this.
Bart,"Come on, Touch of death. Touch of death. Touch of death."
Bart,"Uh, I learned the touch of death."
Bart,"Permit me to demonstrate. Lisa, shut your eyes. Soon you will be at peace."
Bart,Uh-oh. Gotta get back to karate class.
Bart,You missed a spot.
Bart,"All right. Comin' through. Outta my way. Move it along. Step aside, lady."
Bart,Today we learned how to rip a man's heart out and show it to him before he dies.
Bart,"Hey, Lis. Change the channel."
Bart,I grow weary of this new channel. Change it back.
Bart,"Sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old Daddly-doodly."
Bart,"Hey, keep your hands off my china hutch."
Bart,"Hey Lis, something wrong?"
Bart,Uh oh.
Bart,"I think they've learned their lesson already, Lis."
Bart,Good mornin' world!
Bart,Ow!
Bart,Good morning Lisa!
Bart,"Why shouldn't I be happy? It's a beautiful day, my homework is done, I've got my mojo workin' and we're goin' on a field trip this afternoon."
Bart,And... looks like I got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge.
Bart,Hey! It's not in here. You stole it!
Bart,"Hey, that's my badge, Homer."
Bart,... Lousy prize-grabbing... badge-wearing...
Bart,You ate my homework?
Bart,I didn't know dogs really did that.
Bart,Wait! Wait!
Bart,But I'm only... ... ... five... ten... twenty... forty minutes? That's pretty damn late.
Bart,Hey girls! Look at me!
Bart,You can stop lookin' at me now.
Bart,What a day.
Bart,You're making me lick envelopes?
Bart,What kind of game?
Bart,Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me.
Bart,No thir.
Bart,Tan Die Doe Dow?
Bart,Tan... Die.... Doe... Dow.
Bart,Die don't.
Bart,What next?
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,Hands off the material!
Bart,Eat my shorts.
Bart,Don't have a cow.
Bart,Cool!
Bart,I don't know.
Bart,I'm not sure I...
Bart,"Oh... I dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin' cigars... you know -- a job."
Bart,Thirty bucks a week.
Bart,"I was lookin' for those. Thanks, doll."
Bart,No.
Bart,They're not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full.
Bart,Right in here my man.
Bart,I don't think so. Although it would explain an awful lot.
Bart,"Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks?"
Bart,No.
Bart,Uh-uh.
Bart,I guess that's okay.
Bart,Hell no!
Bart,Supoib.

Bart,"More ""stink lines"" boys."
Bart,You ain't seen nothin'. Now beat it.
Bart,Lousy Skinner.
Bart,Of course I'm late for work. How can I be on time when Principal Skinner keeps me after school?
Bart,"He sure is, Patrone."
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"That is not funny, Lewis."
Bart,That's not true! It's just a rumor! You're engaged in speculation. I know the law. You can't prove anything.
Bart,Reverend Lovejoy! You've... you've come to comfort me?
Bart,Did you kill my principal?
Bart,No! My principal!
Bart,What's that guy doing here?
Bart,Hey!
Bart,Get bent.
Bart,"Sorry Fat Tony. I used to think your gang was cool, but now I learned that crime doesn't pay."
Bart,Cool!
Bart,"""To me bestest bud Milhouse, Happy Birthday, Bart."""
Bart,"C'mon, open it open it open it."
Bart,"Aw Milhouse, just cuz your mom didn't let you have a party doesn't mean you can't get a present."
Bart,What are you girls talkin' about?
Bart,Twins. Open your present.
Bart,"They're official Krusty the Clown walkie-talkies. I'll keep one and you keep one. Now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie."
Bart,What's he talkin' about?
Bart,"Wow, brown!"
Bart,You did have a party. You didn't invite me. And I thought we were best friends.
Bart,"My best friend shafted me. I'll never get over this, Otto-man."
Bart,"Milhouse, a little salt?"
Bart,"Now we're even for your party. C'mon, let's go play."
Bart,What's she got against me?
Bart,"Bad influence my ass! How many times have I told you, never listen to your mother!"
Bart,"Whatever she's paying you, I'll double it."
Bart,Nah. I'm just depressed. Milhouse's mom won't let me play with him any more.
Bart,I had a fight with Milhouse.
Bart,One... two... three... Community chest.
Bart,Nah.
Bart,Nah.
Bart,Ah. I've won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks.
Bart,Ha ha! You're losing.
Bart,"Don't worry mom, there's tons of these things."
Bart,I don't wanna play with Milhouse.
Bart,"It's his mom. She says I'm a bad influence. C'mon Maggie, let's go throw rocks at that hornet's nest."
Bart,Really? We can be friends again? Did your mom die?
Bart,"Who cares?! Milhouse, I'll be right there! Sorry Maggie, game's over."
Bart,"Hey Mom, I'm friends with Milhouse again."
Bart,Thanks for sticking up for me.
Bart,Who else would?
Bart,I will.
Bart,"Yes, sir?"
Bart,"Okay Milhouse, how many Krusty autographs should I put you down for?"
Bart,Consider it done.
Bart,YOU'RE WALKING ALONG THE STREET/ OR YOU'RE AT A PARTY/ OR ELSE YOU'RE ALONE/ AND THEN YOU SUDDENLY DIG... DIG... DIG.
Bart,THIS COULD BE THE START OF SOMETHING BIG...
Bart,"Aw, man."
Bart,"Dear Krusty, this is Bart Simpson, Krusty Buddy #16302 respectfully returning his Badge..."
Bart,"...I always suspected that nothing in life mattered. Now I know for sure. Get bent, Bart Simpson."
Bart,"Why bother, they'll just get dirty again."
Bart,"He is, for sure?"
Bart,God bless that clown.
Bart,Milhouse. You can come in and drop the charade.
Bart,"Krusty, you don't have to be ""on"" tonight."
Bart,"Yeah, just relax and be yourself."
Bart,"Krusty, would you do the honors?"
Bart,"Krusty, are you alright?"
Bart,"Yeah, spill your guts, man."
Bart,"Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you."
Bart,"Krusty, do you think about your father a lot?"
Bart,"Yeah, I've got a lot of fond memories."
Bart,"Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad."
Bart,No!
Bart,"Oh great, we came all this way and it's the wrong guy."
Bart,Poor Krusty.
Bart,We've got to do something.
Bart,"Reverend Lovejoy, we need you to help us find a rabbi."
Bart,Really?
Bart,"Oh, oh, that radio show."
Bart,We'll put them on later. Now can you give us the rabbi's address?
Bart,"He'll be so happy, he'll be crying in his beard."
Bart,We came to talk to you about your son.
Bart,"Hello, my name's Dimitri. I'm a first time caller, long time listener."
Bart,"My question is, ""If a son defies his father, and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy, shouldn't the father forgive the son?"""
Bart,"Don't worry, Lis. I've got a plan that can't fail."
Bart,"Yiddle my man, you're a genius."
Bart,"Speaking of charity, Rabbi Krustofsky, don't you think it's time you forgave your son?"
Bart,"Oy, this guy's tough."
Bart,"I don't know, he's pretty sharp. He saw right through this disguise."
Bart,Au revoir.
Bart,"Sorry, no. Just get us another bowl of complimentary pickles."
Bart,Those stupid hats?
Bart,"Ahhh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us... No!!"
Bart,"But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, ""A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right."""
Bart,Then doesn't your religion command you to make up with Krusty?
Bart,"Oh, it's hopeless."
Bart,At all times let a man be supple as a reed and not rigid as a cedar.
Bart,"Is it not written in the Talmud, ""Who will bring redemption? The jesters."""
Bart,"Rabbi, did not a great man say, and I quote, ""The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I've heard of persecution, but what they went through is ridiculous! But the great thing is after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it."" End quote."
Bart,Nope.
Bart,Nope.
Bart,Nope.
Bart,"I'm afraid not, Rabbi. It's from ""Yes, I Can"" by Sammy Davis Jr. An entertainer like your son."
Bart,Heh heh heh...Jackpot!
Bart,We would have gotten even more if Lisa could walk faster.
Bart,"Oh, yeah. Everybody in the family is gonna have a bad nightmare tonight."
Bart,I can do that but I don't wanna.
Bart,Let's wish for x-ray specs that really work.
Bart,X-ray specs.
Bart,X-ray specs.
Bart,X-ray specs.
Bart,X-ray spects.
Bart,"Okay, no more fooling around. Paw, this is Bart. I wish for the Simpsons to be rich and famous."
Bart,"Jeez, now we're slaves. This paw sucks."
Bart,Huh?... S'matter?
Bart,No.
Bart,Climb aboard.
Bart,"Less talk, more sleep."
Bart,Good morning.
Bart,"Every day, same old cat. I'll make him more interesting."
Bart,"Oh, there. That's better."
Bart,Okay.
Bart,Hi guys. Hi Otto. Move over. I'm driving.
Bart,"Quit riding the brake, Otto. Give it some gas, man."
Bart,Phone.
Bart,I love school.
Bart,I want to watch Krusty.
Bart,Do I ever!
Bart,"Good night, dad. You know, these last few days have been really swell. I wish there was something I could do to repay you."
Bart,You got it.
Bart,"I love you, dad."
Bart,Yaahhh!
Bart,We both had nightmares.
Bart,"Hey, Dad. Here's one. Twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people."
Bart,Grave digger.
Bart,Dad's missing? Get outta here.
Bart,"Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab."
Bart,I'd like to open with my impression of Principal Skinner.
Bart,"Duh, look at me, I'm Principal Skinner."
Bart,"Hey, it's Lunchlady Doris. I wonder what she's got for us today. Today's special is refried dog poop."
Bart,"Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony?"
Bart,I don't love you either. So give me a moped.
Bart,"Grampa, if you wanna go right..."
Bart,... move your joystick to the left.
Bart,"Uh-oh, here comes a Xylon cruiser. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go into hyperspace! Ready, hit it!"
Bart,"Grampa, you're the spaceship, not the..."
Bart,"Game's over, Grampa."
Bart,Busted!
Bart,"Oh my God, she killed him."
Bart,"Well, it's still fun to be up late."
Bart,"Hey, Homer, where ya goin'?"
Bart,The poor guy. Where's he working?
Bart,I can make her. Just give me five minutes alone with her.
Bart,"Hey, pink hat, when I ordered that blueberry squishee, I meant today."
Bart,And fill it to the top this time.
Bart,"Hey, Dad, you got a power drill?"
Bart,Check.
Bart,"Hey, Homer, I can't find the safety goggles for the power saw."
Bart,"Oh, check."
Bart,What?
Bart,"No, not really."
Bart,Building a Soap Box Derby racer.
Bart,"Hey, so it is."
Bart,"Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, ""Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine."""
Bart,"Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin?"
Bart,Maybe it's for the best.
Bart,"Thanks, but I'm almost done. Why don't you get back on the couch and watch TV?"
Bart,"Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad's help."
Bart,"Come on Dad, it'd be weird."
Bart,"Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes."
Bart,"Helmets are for wusses, Sir."
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,"It's over there, Nelson."
Bart,What was that?
Bart,"Don't worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, ""Gravity is my co-pilot."""
Bart,Is it okay to visit?
Bart,"Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death."
Bart,"You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build 'em like you."
Bart,"If you don't race, then Nelson'll win!"
Bart,"Oh, I don't know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else's it'd kill him. On the other hand... I'll do it."
Bart,"Dad... I don't know how to say this, but I don't want to drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart..."
Bart,"Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win."
Bart,"Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin's car I can win. I'm sorry, but..."
Bart,"Dad, aren't you coming?"
Bart,"Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge."
Bart,Kill spectators.
Bart,"It's my dad. Lying there on the couch drinking a beer, staring at the TV. I've never seen him like that."
Bart,Let's rock.
Bart,"Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... This is for you, Dad."
Bart,"Thanks, Nelson, put her there."
Bart,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Loser! Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
Bart,"Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!"
Bart,"Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!"
Bart,"Whoa, T and A."
Bart,Lisa's slumber party.
Bart,Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me?
Bart,What the... ?
Bart,Aaahhh!
Bart,Ptew!! Ptew!! I'm telling Mom and Dad.
Bart,"Because I'm ""jinxed"" dammit!"
Bart,Ow! What was that for?
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,"""The Inventor I Admire"", by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. He's my father, Homer Simpson, creator of... the ""Flaming Homer""!"
Bart,"It's not true! My father invented that drink, and if you'll allow me to demonstrate..."
Bart,I brought enough for everybody.
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Uh, yes, I'm looking for a friend of mine. Last name Jass, first name Hugh."
Bart,Uh... hi.
Bart,Bart Simpson.
Bart,"Uh, look. I'll level with you, mister. This is a crank call that sorta backfired and I'd like to bail out right now."
Bart,"Okay, but you promised me moe money."
Bart,"Wow, fifty-two hundred smackers."
Bart,What are we going to spend it on?
Bart,Come on everybody. It makes you feel better.
Bart,"Yo, Homer. You gotta get ready for work."
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,"And today, instead of buying comic books, I just read 'em and left 'em in the store."
Bart,I didn't take a bath today and I may not take one tomorrow.
Bart,"Uh yes, I'm looking for a Mrs. O'Problem. First name... Bee."
Bart,"Excuse me, I'm looking for --"
Bart,That's right. That's my pop!
Bart,"Yeah, well, I make some crank phone calls."
Bart,"Moe, for you... anything?"
Bart,"EVERY TEDDY BEAR WHO'S BEEN GOOD IS SURE OF A TREAT TODAY/ THERE'S LOTS OF MARVELOUS THINGS TO EAT, AND WONDERFUL GAMES TO PLAY/ BENEATH THE TREES, WHERE NOBODY SEES/ THEY'LL HIDE AND SEEK AS LONG AS THEY PLEASE/ TODAY'S THE DAY THE TEDDY BEARS HAVE THEIR PICNIC!"
Bart,"Hey Mr. Burns, did you get that letter I sent?"
Bart,That's because I forgot to stamp it.
Bart,"Hey, Homer, how come Mom's going to the doctor?"
Bart,I smell a bun in the oven.
Bart,"You're a machine, Homer."
Bart,"Ohhh, cool, we can race them."
Bart,Were you like this when Mom was pregnant with me?
Bart,"I thought it was over. You had a problem turning a blade, you overcame it. The feel-good story of the year."
Bart,"I'm sorry, the baby's name will be Kool Moe Dee Simpson."
Bart,Kool Moe Dee.
Bart,Kool Moe Dee.
Bart,Kool Moe Dee.
Bart,All right! Stick it to the Man.
Bart,"Hey Homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?"
Bart,All right! Here comes my name!
Bart,"Wow, best eight bucks I ever spent."
Bart,Isn't that nice? Take a message. Right now I'm off to hit forty-six local merchants for free birthday goods and services.
Bart,I'm here for my free birthday sundae.
Bart,"Digital audio tape, my butt! When I was a kid, we had compact discs, and I don't recall no one complaining."
Bart,"Sorry, Rosarita. I gotta get to my birthday party."
Bart,"Hey, good to see ya. Glad you could make it. Toby, have you lost weight? Uh-oh, here comes trouble."
Bart,"Cool, Larry the Looter!"
Bart,"Well, I'm --"
Bart,"Hell, no."
Bart,Wha th...?
Bart,Ehhh...
Bart,Next.
Bart,"Next, please."
Bart,Fine.
Bart,Here you go. Enjoy.
Bart,What a crappy birthday.
Bart,"What do you mean, how did I get on the radio? I created the universe! Stupid kids."
Bart,"Hey, it does work!"
Bart,Hmmm.
Bart,"People of Earth, this is Bartron, commander of the Martian invasion force. Your planet is in our hands. Resistance is useless."
Bart,We have captured your president. He was delicious.
Bart,Uh-huh.
Bart,I promise.
Bart,Mama! Mama!
Bart,"Sorry lady, show's over."
Bart,"Oh, brotherrr."
Bart,Mrs. Krabappel! That was uncalled for!
Bart,Rod... Todd... this is God.
Bart,Talk is cheap. Perhaps a test of thy faith. Walk through the wall. I will remove it for you...later.
Bart,I got a job for thee. Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen and leave them on the Simpsons porch.
Bart,"Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?"
Bart,Then quit flapping your lip and make with the cookies.
Bart,Whoops!
Bart,Help! Help!
Bart,"Help me, please! I fell down the well!"
Bart,Sucker.
Bart,Yes!
Bart,My name is Timmy O'Toole. I just turned ten years old.
Bart,"Uh... I have no family. I tried to enroll in school, but your Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes."
Bart,"Drop that microphone! Drop it, boy!"
Bart,"I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn't get through my sock. Goodnight everybody."
Bart,Oh yeah? And how are they gonna find out?
Bart,The police. They couldn't catch a cold.
Bart,What did I do to deserve this?
Bart,Help! Help! I fell down the well.
Bart,No! My name is Bart Simpson!
Bart,"Look, I'll level with you. There is no Timmy O'Toole. It was just a prank I was playing on everybody."
Bart,"Great joke, guys. Ha ha. Ha. Guys?"
Bart,Ow! Knock it off you bald boob!
Bart,Like to see you fit.
Bart,No!
Bart,"Mom, it's too big."
Bart,"You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. I guess now I'm paying the price. But there's so many things I'll never get a chance to do. Smoke a cigarette, use a fake I.D., shave a swear word in my hair..."
Bart,Sting!
Bart,Mom! Dad!
Bart,"Man, I was so scared."
Bart,Whaaat?
Bart,"See you in Hell, soldier boy!"
Bart,Yeah mom?
Bart,"Mom, I'd love to. But to be honest, I don't need new clothes."
Bart,So even though I'd love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes. It's not...
Bart,"Mom, I'm tired. I wanna go home. Can't I just lie down for a minute?"
Bart,"Fine, get it. Lets go."
Bart,"You know why these clothes are on sale, Mom? Because the people who wear them get beaten up."
Bart,How'd ya know?
Bart,"In here, Mom. But don't open the--"
Bart,I'll do the honors.
Bart,"No. No. No. No. My God, what passes for a wine list these days. Marco, just bring us your freshest bottle of wine. Chop. Chop."
Bart,"Dad, I promise you I will never get tired of this."
Bart,"Hey, once again. Great present, Dad."
Bart,"Oh, this sucks. C'mon snipers. Where are you?"
Bart,You hate dad is up by a touchdown.
Bart,I guess you love dad.
Bart,Thanks mom.
Bart,Never happen.
Bart,"Well, I'll be damned."
Bart,It's a nervous twitch and I'm a little sensitive about it if you don't mind.
Bart,Where's my lucky red cap?
Bart,In your bed?
Bart,"I'm scared, Lisa."
Bart,Aaah!
Bart,I've said it before and I'll say it again... Aye carumba!
Bart,"Hey, Lis -- Bang! Bang!"
Bart,Eew!
Bart,"Mom, I think I speak for everyone in this bed when I say you have nothing to worry about. Now let's just try and get a little shut eye, okay?"
Bart,"Gross, he's picking his nose!"
Bart,Those guys must be millionaires!
Bart,How much do those yo-yos cost?
Bart,Thank you. Thank you.
Bart,Yo.
Bart,Just one. A little something I call Plucking the Pickle.
Bart,"I build up a little steam, and..."
Bart,I didn't do it.
Bart,"Mrs. Krabappel, we're all upset by the untimely deaths of Stinky and Wrinkles. But life goes on. So, if I could just have my yo-yo back..."
Bart,Here you go... Just kidding. Here you go... Just kidding.
Bart,Absolutely.
Bart,"One months detention... She'll pay for this. Yup, there's your problem... someone jammed a Malibu Stacy head down here."
Bart,"Huh. One plus one equals two? Recently divorced fourth-grade teacher wishes to meet man age 18-60. Object: save me. Write Edna K, Box 402."
Bart,Hmmm.
Bart,"Dear Edna, I've never answered a personal ad before, but I found yours irresistible. My name is..."
Bart,"Oh, not bad. I'm starting to get the hang of the floor waxer."
Bart,Yes!
Bart,Yeah. I'm the 28th President of the United States.
Bart,"Oh, please."
Bart,You've got a date with a xerox machine.
Bart,"Hey, Lis, a moment of your time."
Bart,Suppose I was writing a second letter to a girl and I already used up my A material. What should I say?
Bart,No! It's not for me. It's homework.
Bart,"Hey Mom, did you save the love letters Dad sent you?"
Bart,"Wow, a side of dad I've never seen."
Bart,"Penny for your thoughts, Mrs. K."
Bart,Try me. Sometimes it helps to talk.
Bart,Uh-huh.
Bart,Oh yeah.
Bart,Dear Edna: Your photo took my breath away.
Bart,"Ohhh, slow down, Frenchy! This stuff is gold."
Bart,"Strap on your skates Gordie, you're going in."
Bart,Huh? Aye carumba!
Bart,"Well, she's dangled on the line long enough. It's time to boat this bass."
Bart,"Yes, ma'am."
Bart,"""Edna, every second until we meet stabs me like a thousand needles..."""
Bart,I can't help but feel partly responsible.
Bart,"Homer, that was a twenty."
Bart,"Mrs. K, whoever this guy is, you don't need him. There are plenty of good men around."
Bart,What's wrong with Principal Skinner?
Bart,What about Coach Fortner?
Bart,Wow! What about Groundskeeper Willie?
Bart,"Mom, this is a little ahead of schedule, but I need help with my love life."
Bart,Mrs. Krabappel.
Bart,"That sucks. How 'bout, ""Crocodiles bit off my face."""
Bart,"""I must finish this letter quickly, for I have only four minutes to live."""
Bart,"Ohhh, Homer, you old honey dripper."
Bart,It's a date.
Bart,What's that? A home-made bat?
Bart,Wow! How many home runs you gonna hit with that?
Bart,"Uh, Mom, why don't you let me call the game."
Bart,"Homer, can I get you a beer?"
Bart,You make me sick Homer. You're the one who told me I could do anything if I just put my mind to it.
Bart,"Gotcha. Can't win, don't try."
Bart,"Aw geez... okay, I'll take Milhouse."
Bart,"Damn! All right, I'll take Lewis."
Bart,"We've seen it, dad."
Bart,"Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl."
Bart,"We'll tell ya, mom."
Bart,I knew it.
Bart,"Police officer? Well, I'll be jiggered."
Bart,"Hey, I don't need you to get me in the back of a police car."
Bart,"Wow, a drifter."
Bart,Cool.
Bart,Policeman.
Bart,Wow! Can I see your club?
Bart,"Oh, what's it for?"
Bart,"So, you guys like being cops?"
Bart,Huh-huh.
Bart,Do you need straight A's to be a cop?
Bart,"Hey, fellas, let's go shoot some bad guys."
Bart,"Oh, baby!"
Bart,Woww!
Bart,"Sir, I know what I wanna be when I grow up. A cop!"
Bart,"Now, just relax your hand."
Bart,"Thank you, Ma'am. You've been most cooperative."
Bart,"Mom, before you blame the dog, I think you should take a look at these surveillance photos."
Bart,"Uh, I don't know how that got in there."
Bart,Really?
Bart,Get him outta here.
Bart,"Well, it's quite simple, really. I observed our friend Groundskeeper Willie burning leaves with a blatant disregard for our clean air laws."
Bart,"That's right, man. I got my first taste of authority... And I liked it."
Bart,Go on.
Bart,Wouldn't that mean squealing on other kids?
Bart,Hmm.
Bart,"Uh, I don't know."
Bart,You've got yourself a narc.
Bart,"Hey, Jimbo, keepin' your nose clean, dude? Attaboy! Hey, Donna, who loves ya, baby?"
Bart,"Not in my hall, bub."
Bart,"I think you've had enough, sister. C'mon, let's keep it moving."
Bart,"Allright, break it up, boys. That belly ain't gonna get any pinker."
Bart,"Every day is a new fight, sir."
Bart,Madre de Dios! The legends were true!
Bart,All-riight!
Bart,I will.
Bart,"Seymour, this is an absent slip signed by Nelson's mother. And this is Nelson's English homework. Notice the identical elongated loops on the d's."
Bart,"Let's go, Milhouse."
Bart,"Seymour, I'll bet you a steak dinner those books are still here. All we have to do is search every locker."
Bart,"Pfft, Supreme Court. What have they done for us lately?"
Bart,Lisa.
Bart,"Lis, why did you do it?"
Bart,"Yeah, but even I had my limits. You're looking at expulsion for this."
Bart,I am.
Bart,"Sorry if I betrayed your trust, Principal Sucker."
Bart,Four hundred days. I can do that standing on my head.
Bart,"Oooh, big man."
Bart,Maybe I'll just shut my big mouth.
Bart,"'Cause I didn't want you to wreck your life. You got the brains and the talent to go as far as you want. And when you do, I'll be right there to borrow money."
Bart,"Soundin' good, Lis!"
Bart,Put it in the bank.
Bart,"What are you gonna do, Homer?"
Bart,"Grampa, he's not dead!"
Bart,Talk what over? What's there to talk about?
Bart,What are we going to talk over?
Bart,I can't help but notice we're leaving the hospital. When's the dog going to get his operation?
Bart,Is there a Doggie Hell?
Bart,Who's in there?
Bart,"Hey! Wait a minute, does this have anything to do with Santa's Little Helper?"
Bart,You're gonna just let him die?
Bart,Darn right I'm upset!
Bart,We are not going to let our dog die! And that's IT! Lousy dog-killing sonsa...
Bart,No problemo.
Bart,Dumb dog.
Bart,Lisa! Close the gate.
Bart,It's all my fault. I called him a dumb dog.
Bart,I'm not giving up. I don't care if I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. I'm gonna find my dog.
Bart,"Um, excuse me sir, I lost my dog."
Bart,"Gee, I'm sorry mister."
Bart,Santa's Little Helper! It's you! AAAGGGHHH!!
Bart,What's the matter boy? Don't you know me? I'm your buddy!
Bart,"I love ya, boy."
Bart,Ernest Cuts The Cheese!
Bart,"If you don't watch the violence, you'll never get desensitized to it."
Bart,It's over.
Bart,"Forget it, mom. Dad's really mad. The tendons are throbbing at the base of his neck..."
Bart,And stress is collecting in the trouble spots here... here... and here... Making for one unhappy pappy.
Bart,Country music sucks. All it does is take precious air space away from shock DJ's whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
Bart,"Hey Dad, can I do a ham-bone solo?"
Bart,"As much as I hate that man right now, you gotta love that suit."
Bart,It's like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen.
Bart,Bleuh.
Bart,"Cool, he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunch tray."
Bart,"That's right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery."
Bart,"Don't be a fool, Aunt Selma. That man is scum."
Bart,Aye-Carumba!
Bart,Knock it off.
Bart,I can't believe you guys. This man framed Krusty the Clown.
Bart,That Sideshow Bob is a no-good showbiz phony.
Bart,"Oh well, I guess the wedding's off. Fiddle dee dee, tomorrow's another day."
Bart,Bart no like. Bad medicine.
Bart,"Hey, they chose Maggie, okay?"
Bart,"Chief Wiggum, you've been around. You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you?"
Bart,Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace?
Bart,Romantic? With Aunt Selma?
Bart,Aunt Selma has one hour to live!
Bart,"Sideshow Bob, I'm afraid the only victims here are the good people at Best Western Hotels."
Bart,"Chief Wiggum, think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser?"
Bart,"Well, I'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do his job."
Bart,All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas.
Bart,Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except Aunt Selma.
Bart,"She happily watched her MacGyver, unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas. All it needed to explode was a single spark... say, from a cigarette..."
Bart,Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.
Bart,"Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come!"
Bart,"After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way."
Bart,Noooo!
Bart,"Thanks, Mom. Now. Let's get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate."
Bart,"Hey Homer, let's book! I want to get there in time to whip eggs at the warm-up act."
Bart,"Hey Milhouse, cool jacket!"
Bart,"Thanks, Dad. Sure you're not gonna be bored?"
Bart,"Gee, I'm sorry, man."
Bart,About the frisbee.
Bart,I said slag off!
Bart,That's only four miles from my house!
Bart,What a gyp!
Bart,Cool.
Bart,Knock it off.
Bart,"Hi, Mom."
Bart,"Mom, I want to be a rock star."
Bart,Wow!
Bart,"I'd like to play me latest chart-topper. It's called ""Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs."""
Bart,Slag off!
Bart,Polly Wolly Doodle.
Bart,I think it's broken.
Bart,"I didn't know you played the guitar, Otto-man!"
Bart,Where's Otto?
Bart,"Rough day, Apu. Pump me a Squishee and don't spare the syrup."
Bart,Uh... okay.
Bart,Uggh...
Bart,Otto-man?
Bart,You're living in a dumpster?
Bart,"Otto, why don't you come home with me? You can stay in our garage."
Bart,"Mom, I thought you might forget our little conversation this afternoon, so I took the precaution of recording it."
Bart,"Mom, can Otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? He sure can!"
Bart,"Dad, Otto's going through a real tough time. Can't he stay with us for awhile?"
Bart,"Please, Dad. If you let Otto stay, he'll help around the house, and chip in a few bucks whenever he can."
Bart,"I'll tell you the truth, Dad. I wasn't good at it right away, so I quit. I hope you're not mad."
Bart,"You can do it, Otto. You're the coolest adult I ever met."
Bart,What's on?
Bart,"What are you going to do, Otto?"
Bart,"He didn't call you a bum, he called you a sponge."
Bart,Otto!
Bart,Cool! An oversized novelty billiard ball.
Bart,Will I pass my English test?
Bart,Outlook not so good. Wow! It does work!
Bart,"Hey, I got a good one. Will Milhouse and I be friends till we're toothless old men with hair coming out of our ears? READING BALL, SURPRISED) ""Don't count on it."" Will Milhouse and I be friends when we're high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? ""It looks doubtful."" Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day?"
Bart,What could come between two bestest buddies like us?
Bart,"To those who doubt the power of the Magic 8-Ball, I say ""Behold my ""F!"""
Bart,"Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet willie?"
Bart,"Victim number four. Hey, Lewis, can I interest you in a wet willie?"
Bart,Bo-ring!
Bart,"How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature?"
Bart,"God shmod, I want my monkey-man."
Bart,"Hey, wait Otto-man, you can't leave. Milhouse isn't here yet."
Bart,"Milhouse, what a pleasant surprise."
Bart,"Hey, what's with the skirt?"
Bart,"Yeah, but never a girl. What if I want to strut around nude?"
Bart,"No, that's okay. You can stay. You can read comics with us. Let's see, something for the lady...ah, ""Radioactive Man Vs. the Swamp Hag."
Bart,"No, but my sister's got a wide selection of crappy comics."
Bart,you guys wanna see something gross?
Bart,"Okay, Milhouse... I'll trade your Carl Yastrzemski baseball card for my Omar Vizquel."
Bart,"Deal! Next on the trading block, your Mickey Mantle -- 1958, mint condition -- for my picture of Homer on the couch."
Bart,"Milhouse, we're living in the age of cooties. I can't believe the risk you're running. Besides, what's so great about kissing?"
Bart,But she doesn't melt.
Bart,He has a girlfriend.
Bart,"Yeah, all they do is kiss."
Bart,No.
Bart,Hey Martin.
Bart,"Listen Martin, right now I'm looking for a friend who won't leave me for a girl."
Bart,"Yeah, right. Anyway... do you want to do something after school?"
Bart,"Uh, sure."
Bart,"Hey, guys."
Bart,"Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't the three of us go spit on the Principal's car?"
Bart,Oh. Fine. I'm tired of watching you two lip wrestle. There's plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town.
Bart,Yeah?
Bart,What? Get bent.
Bart,"All right, Milhouse. You can use my tree house."
Bart,"Samantha and Milhouse sitting in a tree, about to lose their pri-va-cy!"
Bart,"Hello, Mr. Stanky... I have some shocking news about your daughter Samantha... Who am I? Let's just say I'm a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands."
Bart,"Well Milhouse, ""'Tis better to have loved and lost""... yada yada yada... let's go to the arcade."
Bart,"Five fingers? Ew, freak show. Listen, Lis. I need some advice and mom's not here."
Bart,"I did, but I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying. Lisa, I feel terrible. I ratted on my best friend and he doesn't even know I did it."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Milhouse?
Bart,"Oh, come on, I've seen you cry a million times. You cry when you scrape your knee. You cry when they're out of chocolate milk. You cry when you're doing long division and you have a remainder left over."
Bart,"Listen, Milhouse. I've got a confession to make. I'm the one who narked on your kissing."
Bart,"Boy, I bet the 8-ball didn't see that one comin'."
Bart,Are you sure you want to do this?
Bart,How are we going to find her?
Bart,"Hey Samantha, I'm sorry about gettin' you thrown in the penguin house."
Bart,"You're asking the wrong guy, Milhouse. They all look alike to me. Now let's go whip donuts at old people"
Bart,"And now, the next event...in our Living Room Olympics... the always controversial, couch vault. I do this for Stain Master Carpets. Proud sponsor of the Living Room Olympics."
Bart,"We were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise."
Bart,"There, there. You're safe now, little sister."
Bart,What about the Emmys?
Bart,"Unky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?"
Bart,Why are we playin' games when we got two grand in the bank!? Remember when Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence?
Bart,"I think we should get a machine gun. We could use it to hunt game, spell out things, or ring in the new year!"
Bart,"Dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother."
Bart,Not really. We peeked inside while you were in the john.
Bart,"Wow! The NRA. Can I be get armor piercing cyanide-tipped bullets, too?"
Bart,"Oh no, Mrs. Krabappel. If I don't get a C average, my Dad won't let me go to Kamp Krusty."
Bart,"Much obliged, doll."
Bart,La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la. La-la-la-la-la. La-la-...
Bart,"Oh, I dreamt it was the last day of school."
Bart,"Oh how do I know this isn't some beautiful dream, too?"
Bart,"You know, a pinch is more traditional."
Bart,"Yeah. Well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. It now goes: D,B,A,C."
Bart,But Dad...
Bart,36-24-36...
Bart,Now let's see what we got here.
Bart,"Ah, my gym shorts."
Bart,I'm gonna swim nekkid.
Bart,"Mrs. Krabappel, in figuring out my final grades, I hope you'll note that all of my textbooks are being returned in excellent condition. In some cases, still in their original wrappings."
Bart,"I'd also like to add as I gaze upon your beauty, I've never seen an angel fly so low."
Bart,"Mrs. Krabappel, if I don't get at least a C average I can't go to Kamp Krusty."
Bart,You bet. Check out this hand. All aces!
Bart,"Well, here goes nothin'."
Bart,"Well, dad, here's my report card. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
Bart,"No, sir."
Bart,So I won't get to go to camp?
Bart,You mean I can go?
Bart,"Oh, Dad. You're the best father a boy could ever have!"
Bart,"Ah sure, there'll be a couple of uptight counselors who won't dig the Bart philosophy, but I feel the human body is a thing of beauty."
Bart,"Hey, hands off my pickle."
Bart,"No, but..."
Bart,Always thinking two moves ahead.
Bart,"Don't look in my closet. In fact, stay out of my room all together."
Bart,When do we get to see Krusty?
Bart,"I'm not worried, Lis. You know why? Because of this..."
Bart,The Krusty Brand seal of approval. You can only find it on products which meet the high personal standards of Krusty the Clown.
Bart,Don't we get to roast marshmallows?
Bart,"We're all gonna die, Lis."
Bart,So did I.
Bart,Krusty is coming. Krusty is coming. Krusty is coming.
Bart,"Lisa, I've been thinking it over, and next summer I am getting a job."
Bart,"See, I told you Krusty would come. Just like I said, heh, heh. He's gonna bring us food and water and smite our enemies."
Bart,That's not Krusty the Clown.
Bart,"All right, that's it! I've been scorched by Krusty before. I got a rapid heart beat from those Krusty brand vitamins; my Krusty calculator didn't have a 7 or an 8; and Krusty's autobiography was self-serving, with many glaring omissions. But this time he's gone too far. We want Krusty! We want Krusty!"
Bart,"My chunky brothers, gorge yourselves at the trough of freedom!"
Bart,"Ehh, this has more zing."
Bart,"I just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp. Can I say ""crappy"" on TV?"
Bart,I smell bacon. Let's see if he's wearing a wire.
Bart,"How could you, Krusty? I'd never lend my name to an inferior product."
Bart,"Krusty, this camp was a nightmare. They fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear."
Bart,"Well actually, the bear just ate his hat."
Bart,Oh yeah.
Bart,Doh-kay.
Bart,He's such a bitch.
Bart,"He's right, mom."
Bart,Are there any jive-talking robots in this play?
Bart,"An' oi'll talk like 'is. Bob's yer uncle, mate."
Bart,Can I slog off school tomorrow? Got a pain in me gulliver.
Bart,"Cool, she can fly!"
Bart,"Hey, look at me! I'm Blanche Dubois!"
Bart,"Way to go, mom."
Bart,"Lookin' for a spot of fun with the missus, eh guv'nor?"
Bart,"Hey, where's Homer?"
Bart,"""Resting"" hung over, ""resting"" got fired..? Help me out here."
Bart,Ahhh... I'm there.
Bart,"Lisa, this is neither the time nor the place."
Bart,"Excuse me... pardon me... whoop... comin' through... how ya doin'?... love that hat, baby..."
Bart,"Amen, brother."
Bart,"Tell it, daddy!"
Bart,Testify!
Bart,"So, Homer, you saw the Big Cheese? What'd he look like?"
Bart,How come we have to go to church and Dad gets to stay home and watch cartoons?
Bart,"Ooop, I got him."
Bart,Dad!
Bart,"Pick the red, get ahead, pick the black, set you back."
Bart,"Goodbye, gentlemen."
Bart,"Hey, Otto-man. I dare you to make this go faster."
Bart,Was it scary?
Bart,Oh baby!
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? Hubba, hubba."
Bart,"And later I'll teach you the tricks of the trade: taping your swimsuit to your butt, petroleum jelly on your teeth for that frictionless smile, and the ancient art of padding ."
Bart,She'll see through me like Grandma's underpants.
Bart,Like what?
Bart,"And who's your little school friend? Wait a minute, that's Mom!"
Bart,"Whooo! Whooo! Dad, do you know anything else about women?"
Bart,"You know, I was just wondering how someone who works in an ice cream store keeps such a trim figure."
Bart,And the winner is... Lisa Simpson!
Bart,"Okay, wipe away a tear... ... hug the loser..."
Bart,And now for your triumphant walk down the runway.
Bart,There's nothing to it. Give me those heels.
Bart,Heel -- toe. Heel -- toe. Heel -- toe.
Bart,"Hey, I'm starting to think I can win."
Bart,"Lis, as your brother, this is the hardest thing I've ever had to say. You're not ugly."
Bart,Nope. Metal.
Bart,That doesn't look like her body.
Bart,"Thanks, Grampa."
Bart,Hey Homer - where's your present?
Bart,Great Caesar's Ghost! A talking Krusty doll!
Bart,"Oh, Dad, this is the best birthday I've ever had."
Bart,"I'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure?"
Bart,So?
Bart,And?
Bart,"Grampa, why don't you tell us a story? You've led an interesting life."
Bart,"Nice try, Mr. Flanders, but I've got a story so scary you'll wet your pants."
Bart,"From A-Apple to Z-Zebra, ""Baby's First Pop-Up Book"" is twenty-six pages of alphabetic adventure."
Bart,"Well, most of it."
Bart,Find Waldo Yet Again.
Bart,"Man, he's just not tryin' anymore. Gee, never noticed that before!"
Bart,Whoa! Ow! What's this?
Bart,Cool.
Bart,"Chapter eight, ""Let's Talk Zombies..."" If a zombie bites you, you become a zombie. You must walk the earth feeding on the brains of the living until the spell is broken."
Bart,"Hey, maybe there's a spell in here that'll bring her back from the dead."
Bart,"Let's see what we've got... ""How to Get Your Skeletons Their Whitest""... ""Selling Your Soul in a Buyer's Market""... Ah, here we are, ""How to Raise The Dead."""
Bart,"Cullen, Rayburn, Narz, Trebek!"
Bart,"Zabar, Kresge, Caldor, Walmart!"
Bart,"Please Lis, they prefer to be called the Living Impaired."
Bart,No.
Bart,I thought dabbling in the black arts would be good for a chuckle. How wrong I was. I should have never read that book.
Bart,"Dad, you killed the zombie Flanders!"
Bart,"Kolchak, Mannix, Banacek, Danno!"
Bart,"Uh, I never realized what a beautiful young woman you've become."
Bart,"Trojan, Ramses, Magnum, Sheik!"
Bart,Shh! TV!
Bart,Hubba hubba! Oh you kid!
Bart,Poison pizza.
Bart,Now's our chance to be bad.
Bart,"I'm starving! Somebody bring me some food, quick!"
Bart,"Over the lips and past the gums, look out dentures, here I come."
Bart,"Yeah, right. Like you're gonna let me go hungry. I'll be eatin' that pizza in five minutes."
Bart,"Just more of me to love, honey."
Bart,Uh oh.
Bart,"Hi mom. Hi dad. Home already? Boy, time really flies when you're reading... The Bible? Ew."
Bart,There must be something to eat around here.
Bart,"Gee, maybe they mean it this time. From now on I guess I'd better straighten up and fly..."
Bart,I promise.
Bart,Sucker.
Bart,"Stick around, Mr. Bond. Things are really starting to ""cook."""
Bart,Wow.
Bart,Indeed I did.
Bart,"Dad, you could punish me. But that means you'd have to think of a punishment, sit here and make sure I do it..."
Bart,Or you could let me go play with Milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable Mexican sitcoms.
Bart,"Jin-gle Bells, Jin-gle Bells..."
Bart,I'unno.
Bart,"Well, you could punish me, but..."
Bart,Uh... we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
Bart,Yuh - huh.
Bart,See ya in the funny pages.
Bart,I got my ticket.
Bart,Sounds like something you'd say.
Bart,"Hey, where is she?"
Bart,"Come on, Homer. This isn't funny."
Bart,"Dad, you gotta let me see that movie. Can't you just give me a spanking?"
Bart,"Come on, go nuts."
Bart,Not bloody likely.
Bart,"Dad, what's the point of this story?"
Bart,"Look, can I please go to the movie?"
Bart,TV sucks.
Bart,"I'm not licked yet. I can entertain myself. No matter how good a movie is, it can't compare to the imagination of a small boy."
Bart,How was it?
Bart,Be honest.
Bart,Lisa.
Bart,It's just not the same.
Bart,You guys must be gettin' pretty tired of that movie by now.
Bart,"One for ""Itchy and Scratchy""."
Bart,"Well, Dad, I guess you won."
Bart,"Well, I'll be. The Itchy and Scratchy Movie."
Bart,Come on. What d'ya say?
Bart,One senior citizen and one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
Bart,Itchy.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"Behold the horrors of the Slanty Shanty. See the twisted creatures that dwell within. Meet ""Cue Ball,"" the man with no hair!"
Bart,Hmmm!
Bart,Cool!
Bart,Sick... on test day... Why? Whyyy?
Bart,"I'm halfway through it, I swear!"
Bart,"Look, Grampa, I'm fine! I really don't need any more home remedies."
Bart,Aaaagh!
Bart,Can't complain.
Bart,Aagh! My ovaries!
Bart,Suckers.
Bart,"I glanced at it... boy cries ""wolf""... has a few laughs... I forget how it ends."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"Well, I'm not sure I'm over it. Shove it, witch."
Bart,Ivanhoe is the story of a Russian farmer and his tool.
Bart,Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!
Bart,Here's my test.
Bart,"The truth is, there was no wolf. I faked the whole thing. I'm just going to lie on the floor now. Please don't let me swallow my tongue."
Bart,"Nervous, Lis? I don't blame you. This is where the Winfields hid their mutated son."
Bart,See that sock over there? It was his only friend.
Bart,"Hello, Lisa. Here in the dark you won't need those eyes. Let me have them."
Bart,There are some who say the monster... ... is still... here!
Bart,Who are you?
Bart,I fell on my bottom.
Bart,I bet you don't know this one. How'd you like a Hertz Donut?
Bart,Oh.
Bart,"Uh, right. Do you know what a Wet Willie is?"
Bart,Huh?
Bart,Whoa!
Bart,I'll never wash this hand again.
Bart,"Sorry, Lis, I no longer control the hand. The hand controls me."
Bart,Maybe Laura could watch us.
Bart,Silence!
Bart,Maybe it's time I wash my hand.
Bart,Yes I am. And it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change.
Bart,"Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest."
Bart,"Why, Laura. What a pleasant surprise."
Bart,Lady's choice.
Bart,Now that is good Labneh.
Bart,O-kay.
Bart,Whoa.
Bart,"Oh no! Here comes the ""Conservative Judge!"""
Bart,Plead insanity! Plead insanity!
Bart,Oh no. You're in Texas!
Bart,How did you know?
Bart,I'm here to see my Grampa.
Bart,You're not my Grampa.
Bart,Huh? Oh. I sure did!... Here's a bus schedule.
Bart,"Grampa, I need some advice. Did you ever have a crush on an older woman?"
Bart,What happened?
Bart,"Dad, I have some questions about women."
Bart,"Dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?"
Bart,How can I get her to notice me?
Bart,I please to aim.
Bart,A boyfriend...
Bart,Jimbo Jones?
Bart,How can you like that guy?
Bart,Jimbo killed him?
Bart,I'll show them who's just a kid.
Bart,What do you like about him? He's just a good-lookin' rebel who plays by his own rules.
Bart,What's wrong?
Bart,I've gotta do something. Hmmmm.
Bart,My name is Jimbo Jones and I live at 1094 Evergreen Terrace.
Bart,That's your outlaw?
Bart,As usual. A knife-wielding maniac has shown us the way.
Bart,Wow...
Bart,"Eh, they'll be chewin' on him for a while."
Bart,Who the hell is Robin?
Bart,"Dad, who's watching TV at 3:17 a.m.?"
Bart,Mr. Plow!
Bart,"You are fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren't you Mr. Plow?"
Bart,Stop it right now.
Bart,"Can you say ""get bent""?"
Bart,Mr. Rogers says it all the time.
Bart,"Shove it? ""Shove it?"""
Bart,"Hey, what was my first word?"
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,Homer!
Bart,Homer.
Bart,Homer.
Bart,Da... da... da...
Bart,Domer.
Bart,Then what happened?
Bart,What were their names?
Bart,Hi yo!
Bart,Got your wallet.
Bart,Beep.
Bart,"Bye-bye, keys."
Bart,Baby.
Bart,"Heh, heh, heh."
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT, SHORT AND STOUT / THIS IS MY HANDLE/ THIS IS MY SPOUT... THE ITSY-BITSY SPIDER WENT UP THE WATER SPOUT, ETC..."
Bart,"DOWN CAME THE RAIN, AND WASHED THE SPIDER OUT."
Bart,"I could have trained them to be my unholy army of the night. Go my pretties... kill, kill!"
Bart,"So, how long before you shipped Grampa off to the old folks home?"
Bart,Mom was pregnant and Dad just threw our money down the sink hole.
Bart,"Hey, Homer. This house sucks."
Bart,Homer. Nyahhh.
Bart,Who the Hell are you?
Bart,I AM SO GREAT / I AM SO GREAT / EVERYBODY LOVES ME / I AM SO GREAT... / EVERYBODY LOVES ME...
Bart,"QUIET, BIET, DIET, ZIET, FIET..."
Bart,Krusty funny.
Bart,Crib! Crib! I'm a baby!
Bart,Can't sleep... Clown'll eat me... Can't sleep... Clown'll eat me...
Bart,I want to go home.
Bart,No I don't.
Bart,"Can you say ""David Hasselhoff""?"
Bart,I hate you.
Bart,Where's the beef? What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Bart,I know a new song.
Bart,"Allouetty, jaunty allouetty, allouetty... ...Hmm. Allouetty..."
Bart,Can I have a lolly-pop?
Bart,I wanna hold the baby. I wanna hold the baby.
Bart,"Hello, Lisa."
Bart,Who's cuter now?
Bart,She started it... came at me with a pipe...
Bart,Stupid mailman... squeal on me...
Bart,"I liked it when it was me, Mom and Homer. You wrecked everything. I'm leaving. Goodbye."
Bart,What did you say?
Bart,Sufferin' succotash! You can talk!
Bart,"Mom, Dad, she can talk! Say it again, Lis."
Bart,I'm her first word!
Bart,"Wow! Lisa, can you say ""Mommy""?"
Bart,I was sitting there!
Bart,It's right there.
Bart,Did not.
Bart,"Hey Lis, there was a big train wreck last night. You wanna see the victims?"
Bart,You're right. Let's bury them at sea.
Bart,"Dad, there's a bug on that."
Bart,"What is it, Dad?"
Bart,Nothing you say can upset us. We're the MTV generation.
Bart,"Oh, no. What if they botch it? I won't have a dad... for a while."
Bart,What about Abraham Lincoln?
Bart,Thanks dad.
Bart,You rule intensive care!
Bart,"C'mon, Lis. We both know how this money should, nay, must be spent."
Bart,"Sorry, Mom, the mob has spoken."
Bart,Monorail! Monorail! Monorail!
Bart,"Wow, Dad. You really know your monorails."
Bart,True or false: You can get mono from riding the monorail?
Bart,"No, you were right, it's ""false."" Wow, you really are gonna be a monorail conductor!"
Bart,"You know, I used to think you were stuck in an emasculating, go-nowhere job."
Bart,"But now, I want to follow in your footsteps."
Bart,I'll get back to you.
Bart,Yee-hawww!
Bart,"Can't you stop it, Dad?"
Bart,"Yeah, but at least we'll take a lot of innocent people with us."
Bart,Uh... Dad?
Bart,"Dad, you're a hero!"
Bart,"Gladys, Gladys... `bout yay high, blue hair, big dent in her forehead?"
Bart,"Oh yeah, there she is."
Bart,No use complaining about something you can't change.
Bart,ON TOP OF SPAGHETTI... ALL COVERED WITH CHEESE... I LOST MY POOR MEATBALL...
Bart,WHICH OLD WITCH?
Bart,"Hey Homer, this luggage is crushing me."
Bart,Counting game.
Bart,Eh.
Bart,Can we go to Duff Gardens this weekend?
Bart,Oh great. Dad's dead.
Bart,"To get to Duff Gardens, I'd ride with Satan himself."
Bart,"It won't be any fun without you, Dad."
Bart,The Duff Beeramid.
Bart,"There's ""Tipsy""! And there's ""Queasy""!"
Bart,Let's see if they wore underwear back then.
Bart,Yeah!
Bart,Beer Goggles - See the World Through the Eyes of a Drunk.
Bart,Wow!
Bart,"What'd you say, Aunt Selma?"
Bart,"Hey man, if the line's this long, it's gotta be good."
Bart,I want to get off.
Bart,Hey Lis. I dare you to drink the water.
Bart,Chicken?
Bart,"Mitch, you're doing a bang-up job."
Bart,Whoa. That isn't good.
Bart,STOP THE RIDE!!!
Bart,"Eye of the Tiger, Bart. Eye of the--"
Bart,I stopped it!
Bart,"No thanks, I told my Dad I'd wait for him."
Bart,That could be Dad... station wagon... luggage rack...
Bart,"Dad, where are you?"
Bart,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Pick up Bart! Pick up Bart!
Bart,I miss Joe Piscopo.
Bart,"Hello, Bigger Brothers? My name is Bart Simpson and I don't have a father."
Bart,Yeah... he left me out on the curb for the ashman. What a revoltin' development.
Bart,Yo!
Bart,I'm Tom. Let's ride.
Bart,Bart's dad has really pulled himself together.
Bart,"Nah, his game was blackjack. He bet our life savings on a single hand."
Bart,"Someday I want to be an F-14 pilot like my hero, Tom. He lent me this new weapon called a Neural Disrupter."
Bart,Nah... But I wouldn't give him any homework for a while.
Bart,"Oh, don't thank me. Thank an unprece-dented eight-year military build-up."
Bart,Father-son picnic.
Bart,Yeah. Great.
Bart,Well... I've been thinking. You've been really great to me... but there's probably some other kid who needs you even more.
Bart,Playing with Milhouse.
Bart,"Dad, it just kinda happened. You're taking this too hard."
Bart,"Well, what are you going to do?"
Bart,"Ho, ho, you'll see."
Bart,Shaddap!
Bart,Uh-oh. Better not let him see me.
Bart,"Hey, Homer, have you seen my skateboard?"
Bart,Who the hell is Pepi?
Bart,Who needs you? Tom's a better father than you ever were.
Bart,I was faking it.
Bart,"Oh yeah? Remember this? ""Higher, Dad, higher!... Whee, whee... Push harder, Dad!..."""
Bart,"This is all my fault, Dad. I didn't want you to get hurt."
Bart,Wait! I've got an idea!
Bart,"Another beer, Dad?"
Bart,"Dad, remember when Tom had you in that headlock and you screamed, ""I'm a hemophiliac"" and when he let you go you kicked him in the back?"
Bart,Will you teach me how to do that?
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"I'll bet you have a lot of things planned, eh Dad?"
Bart,"Hey, Dad. Why don't you give Mom her present?"
Bart,"Cool, I broke his brain."
Bart,"All right, special holiday meal."
Bart,My baboon heart! Body... rejecting it...
Bart,"Oh, I'd give anything to go to that show!"
Bart,Hey!
Bart,That's funny for so many reasons. We have to go to that show.
Bart,"Oh, it isn't fair. I'm ten times the Krusty fan you are. I even have the Krusty home pregnancy test."
Bart,"You're right, Lis. You shouldn't go. It wouldn't be honest. I'll go, disguised as you."
Bart,I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
Bart,I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
Bart,You don't want to know how far I'll go.
Bart,"Watch this, Lis. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half."
Bart,"A-a-a-a-and, now."
Bart,"Hey, girls. Check out this President."
Bart,I am not a butt.
Bart,I'll be good.
Bart,"Hasta la vista, Abie."
Bart,"You're next, Chester A. Arthur!"
Bart,"Unhand me, Yankee."
Bart,Allow me to demonstrate.
Bart,Why are you saying that?
Bart,The kind that help our Olympic athletes reach new peaks of excellence?
Bart,I thought I'd investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs.
Bart,"Soitenly. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck."
Bart,Help me! Help me!
Bart,"Hey Lis, look what I can do."
Bart,Doggone it.
Bart,"Stupid books. Hey, a cupcake."
Bart,Uh-huh.
Bart,Aaahhh!
Bart,"Oooh - wise guy, eh?"
Bart,Ow... ow... ow!
Bart,"Cupcakes, cupcakes. Yes, sweet cakes for all."
Bart,Huh?
Bart,She'll pay for this. I'm gonna crush her like this pellet.
Bart,Ow! Ow! Ow!
Bart,Looking for something?
Bart,"I've hidden it. To find it, you'll need to decipher a series of clues, each more fiendish than the..."
Bart,Step right up folks! We'll answer the question that has been plaguing scientists for ages. Can hamsters fly planes?
Bart,That is one evil dude.
Bart,Doctor Wolfe likes to pull kids' teeth so he can sell them.
Bart,You know that rattle when you shake up spray paint? That's a kid's tooth.
Bart,Cool. She'll be a freak.
Bart,"We can stick her in a trailer, drive her around the South, and charge two bits a gander."
Bart,"Dad, I'll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol' danish."
Bart,"Oh no, I can't see! I'm blind! Blind!"
Bart,"You're goin' down, Homer! I'm gonna fool you!"
Bart,I'll fool you up real nice!
Bart,I've got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? He must have a weakness.
Bart,Beer! Beer is the cheese. But how to use it...
Bart,"Uh, did you know there's a guy outside handing out free Stridex pads?"
Bart,Moron.
Bart,April F...
Bart,Just testing.
Bart,My finger slipped.
Bart,Arrrgh!
Bart,Arrrgh!
Bart,"I won't jump anymore, I promise."
Bart,"I love you, Dad."
Bart,"Here ya go, Doc."
Bart,Shop around. You can't beat that price.
Bart,"Right, Dad."
Bart,And there's one Itchy and Scratchy cartoon I don't think we'll ever forget.
Bart,It was an amusing episode... of our lives.
Bart,"Yeah, well, anyway, I wonder what he's thinking now."
Bart,And sometimes I got into trouble...
Bart,"Dad, I'm so sorry. I know I haven't been a perfect kid..."
Bart,I know that I got you mad once in a while...
Bart,I know.
Bart,...but you always looked out for me.
Bart,"And no matter what happens, I'll never forget the advice you gave me."
Bart,"Dad, it's all my fault! I shook up that can of beer!"
Bart,It was just an April Fool's joke.
Bart,"Dad, it's May 16th."
Bart,What are you gonna change your name to when you grow up?
Bart,Steve Bennett.
Bart,Don't worry. They're building to something.
Bart,Cartoons have writers?
Bart,"Oh, yeah, well you and I could write a better cartoon than that."
Bart,Probably not.
Bart,Lie in the snow and count to sixty.
Bart,"Giddiyup! Merry Christmas, suckers."
Bart,Okay... setting... setting... setting... setting...
Bart,How about a barber shop?
Bart,"Eh, too predictable. The way I see it, instead of shampoo Itchy covers Scratchy's hair with barbecue sauce... opens a box of flesh-eating ants... and the rest writes itself."
Bart,Fine. Put my name first.
Bart,"All right, then to decide it, I propose a race around the world. Meet me at Luster Square at noon tomorrow. The queen herself shall drop the checkered flag."
Bart,Rock.
Bart,I guess we're just not cut out to be writers.
Bart,"Well, how about Grampa? He's pretty out of it. He let those guys use his check book for a whole year."
Bart,"Hey Grampa, we need to know your first name."
Bart,Grampa? Grampa?
Bart,All right! Turn up the volume.
Bart,"Dad, whatever you say, you know you will always have my love and respect."
Bart,"Dad, can we talk to Grampa alone for a minute?"
Bart,Didn't you wonder why you were getting checks for doing absolutely nothing?
Bart,Do we have a deal?
Bart,"Yo, Grampa! Time for the awards."
Bart,"Ah, Grampa! Woo!"
Bart,I'll never watch an awards show again... unless that delightful Billy Crystal's involved.
Bart,"Hey, what do you think he meant by that fools remark?"
Bart,"Hey, I think I can squeeze through that vent."
Bart,Ow!
Bart,I better not.
Bart,Let's go.
Bart,I got expelled.
Bart,"Look, Dad. I don't need school. I'll make my way as a bootblack. Shine yer boots Guv'nor?"
Bart,No problemo.
Bart,"How about ""Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit?"""
Bart,"BEANS, BEANS, THE MUSICAL FRUIT / THE MORE YOU EAT THE MORE YOU TOOT..."
Bart,I guess that's it. I just can't be educated. I can always get a job testing dangerous food additives.
Bart,What's in it?
Bart,Sweet.
Bart,Cool.
Bart,"Have a nice day at school, Lis. I'll just try to make the best of a bad situation. Ahhh..."
Bart,I didn't do it.
Bart,"Is that story true, Grampa?"
Bart,A book?
Bart,"Deformed? Why didn't you say so? They should call this book ""Johnny Deformed!"""
Bart,"""Hundreds would die, but not the thing they died for: 'A man can stand up...'"" Wow."
Bart,"Thanks, Seymour."
Bart,What did they do?
Bart,Was he killed?
Bart,Hey wait a minute. That was the same day he was at Ticonderoga. How could he be in two places at once?
Bart,"Well, according to this, snakes ""hear"" by sensing vibrations in the ground. So, if we put our stereo speakers on the ground and play something with a lot of bass, those snakes'll be in here like Oprah on a baked ham."
Bart,People of Springfield! Whacking Day is a sham!
Bart,It was started in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish.
Bart,"And you like snakes, don't you Barry White?"
Bart,"Hey, dad. This came for you in the mail."
Bart,Maybe you better take that temperature one more time.
Bart,Can you get me some of those Flintstones' chewable morphine?
Bart,... Flintstones' chewable morphine.
Bart,... Flintstones' chewable morphine.
Bart,Morphine
Bart,Morphine
Bart,Mr. Hutz when I grow up I want to be a lawyer just like you.
Bart,"Don't worry, Mom. I'll bust ya outta there just as soon as I get a cocktail dress and a crowbar."
Bart,Fresh!
Bart,Who's gonna change Maggie?
Bart,Dad! We're running out of clean clothes!
Bart,A pack of sugar and peanut butter smeared on a playing card.
Bart,So's yours.
Bart,"We flushed the gator down the toilet, but it got stuck halfway and now we have to feed it."
Bart,No problemo. We'll just sweep it all under the rug.
Bart,Did you see that?
Bart,What's Gabbo?
Bart,Uh-oh. That cute little character could take America by storm. All he needs is a hook.
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,I can't believe it. He stole this bit from Krusty!
Bart,Somebody ought to ruin Gabbo's career the way he ruined Krusty's.
Bart,Yes they do.
Bart,Yes they do.
Bart,Yes they do.
Bart,Hmmm.
Bart,"Well, it's... Ah, you wouldn't be interested. It's too low brow."
Bart,Well... somebody just wrote a bawdy limerick on the men's room wall.
Bart,Oh no!
Bart,"Krusty, are you making any money?"
Bart,Desalinization plant?
Bart,Ed Sullivan?
Bart,I didn't know you knew Luke Perry!
Bart,Elizabeth Taylor... Bette Midler...
Bart,Of course.
Bart,Fascinating.
Bart,"Smart bunnies, Hef. I can call you Hef, can't I?"
Bart,"Hey, Red Hot Chili Peppers. Would you guys like to appear on a Krusty the Klown Special?"
Bart,"No problemo. Hey, Moe! Look over there."
Bart,Krusty! We've got great news!
Bart,You've got to keep working on it.
Bart,"That's alright, Krusty."
Bart,To Krusty. The greatest entertainer in the world. Except maybe that guy.
Bart,Oh boy! Free trading cards!
Bart,Religion?
Bart,What the hell is this?
Bart,"Dad, when did you record an album?"
Bart,"Dad, thanks to television, I can't remember what happened eight minutes ago."
Bart,"No, really, I can't. It's a serious problem."
Bart,What are we all laughing about?
Bart,"Barbershop! That ain't been popular since aught six, dagnabit!"
Bart,No talking like a grizzled 1890's prospector... consarnit!
Bart,I bought this cool pencil holder.
Bart,Yeah!
Bart,What?
Bart,What'd you do... screw up like The Beatles and say you were bigger than Jesus?
Bart,So has Sinatra.
Bart,Ditto Tom Jones.
Bart,"Man, that's some story."
Bart,"Yeah, and what happened to the money you made?"
Bart,Since when could you write a song?
Bart,This is horrible.
Bart,I'm going to kill you.
Bart,"But who'd want to hurt me? I'm this century's ""Dennis the Menace."""
Bart,"Grampa, Matlock's not real."
Bart,That's good.
Bart,Linda Lavin?
Bart,You're out there somewhere. But where? Where?
Bart,You wrote me those letters.
Bart,"I'll be Gus, the lovable chimney sweep. Clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster. Yeah!"
Bart,HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.
Bart,What do you want?
Bart,Mom! Dad! I saw Sideshow Bob and he threatened to kill me!
Bart,"Dad, I'm kinda edgy right now. I'd appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife."
Bart,Mom! Dad!
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Oh, yeah."
Bart,"Well, there is one, but..."
Bart,Nah.
Bart,"Well, you have such a beautiful voice..."
Bart,"Uh-huh. Anyway... I was wondering if you could sing the entire score of ""The HMS Pinafore""?"
Bart,HARDLY EVER! HE'S HARDLY EVER SICK AT SEA!
Bart,"I knew I had to buy some time. So, I asked him to sing the score from ""The HMS Pinafore."""
Bart,"Take him away, boys."
Bart,College? Barber or clown?
Bart,"You the man, Homer."
Bart,"I dunno, Dad. Don't you have a better picture?"
Bart,"Well, Pop, what are you gonna do?"
Bart,"Listen to yourself, man. You're hangin' with nerds."
Bart,"So it's a prank you're lookin' for, is it? I'll give you your prank..."
Bart,"The only other college in fifty miles is Springfield A&M, so they're our best target."
Bart,"Meet Sir Oinks-A-lot, the beloved mascot of Springfield A&M. Here he is presiding over last year's homecoming. Here he is conferring an honorary degree on Richard Nixon. And here he is rolling in his own filth. Gentlemen, I propose we kidnap Sir Oinks-A-lot..."
Bart,Wow!
Bart,My purpose in life is to witness this moment.
Bart,"Dad, start diggin' some nerd holes."
Bart,"Way to go, dad!"
Bart,Incontinent... Too rich.
Bart,"Yes'm. Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can."
Bart,"Dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he'll pay."
Bart,"Hey, Apu, this bag of ice has a head in it."
Bart,"Hey, it's a Teddy bear!"
Bart,"Ew! Gross! It's probably diseased or something. Here, Maggie."
Bart,No. Let's send Burns the eye in the mail. He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger.
Bart,"Paintings. Lifeless images rendered in colorful goop. But at night, they take on a life of their own."
Bart,They become portals to hell so scary and horrible and gruesome that --
Bart,"Yes, mother."
Bart,"The subject of our first painting tonight is the most foul, evil, vicious, diabolical beast to stalk the earth. Of course, I refer to..."
Bart,Buh Dmfl! The Devil!
Bart,Hey.
Bart,The next exhibit in our ghoulish gallery is entitled...The school bus!? Oh oh... They must mean the ghoul bus.
Bart,"Well, there's nothing scarier than having to go to school. Ugh."
Bart,"Krusty Visits Relatives in Annapolis, Maryland..."
Bart,Krusty Poses for Trading Card Photo.
Bart,"Well, at least you got the gum."
Bart,"Ooh, I hope this is sweat."
Bart,"I just had a vision of my own horrible, fiery death."
Bart,"Milhouse. Milhouse, wake up. Quick, look out the window."
Bart,"Otto, you gotta do something! There's a gremlin on the side of the bus!"
Bart,Eyahh! Everybody! There's a monster on the side of the bus!
Bart,"No! No, it's true! There's a monster on the bus."
Bart,"You believe me, don't you? You're my friend who believes me! Sweet, trustworthy Milhouse."
Bart,The gremlin's taking off the wheel! Stop the bus or we're all gonna die!
Bart,"Uh, sure. Well, now that we're friends, Uter, how 'bout loosening these straps, huh?"
Bart,"Look at the bus! I was right, I tell ya! I was right!"
Bart,At least now I can get some rest.
Bart,We come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. To even gaze upon it is to go mad.
Bart,"We had a story to go with this painting, but it was far too intense. So we just threw something together with vampires. Enjoy!"
Bart,"But, you didn't get any on m..."
Bart,Uhhh.
Bart,"Lisa, Burns isn't a vampire. And even if he was, we're not gonna stumble on his secret hiding place."
Bart,Big deal. It's no different from the basement in Grampa's rest home.
Bart,Be be be be be.
Bart,"Nyung, nyung, nyung nyung."
Bart,"I know I really shouldn't, but when am I going to be here again?"
Bart,Whee!
Bart,"Hello, Mother. Hello, Father. I missed you during my uneventful absence."
Bart,"Come join us, Lisa. It's so cool! You get to stay up all night drinking blood!"
Bart,"Lisa, it's not like you have a choice here."
Bart,We're all vampires.
Bart,Maybe it's the TV.
Bart,Rock the Casbah!
Bart,"Don't worry. You'll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover, Homina..."
Bart,"You're absolutely right, Homer. We don't need a baby-sitter."
Bart,Blast that infernal card! Don't give that card to me.
Bart,"Hey, it's morning, and Mom and Dad aren't home yet."
Bart,Cool!
Bart,"Eh, shut your yap."
Bart,He said what now?
Bart,"You're a good dog, arencha, boy? Arencha?"
Bart,WOWWW!!
Bart,I can't believe it!
Bart,Look at me! /
Bart,I will never get tired of this.
Bart,Otto! You okay?
Bart,Dad. Dad! You really want to get rid of this trampoline?
Bart,Observe - a bike lock.
Bart,Now just turn around and count to three.
Bart,"One, two, three."
Bart,"Uh, better make it five."
Bart,"Uh-oh. You're in for it now, Dad."
Bart,What an odd thing to say.
Bart,A human GOING!
Bart,I 'unno.
Bart,I do what I feel like.
Bart,Earth to boring guy.
Bart,Rudiger.
Bart,"Lis, today I am a god."
Bart,Ewww... uhh.
Bart,It was...
Bart,Aw geez. Everybody's a comedian.
Bart,I'm blue. Time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass.
Bart,"Oh, man."
Bart,"Lis, everyone in town is acting like me, so why does it suck?"
Bart,I see.
Bart,What's the answer?
Bart,"Sounds good, sis. Just tell me what to do."
Bart,Skateboards? You copycat wannabes.
Bart,Ow!
Bart,Eep.
Bart,"Crank it, Homer."
Bart,"Keep cool, Simpson. Be in the game, but not of the game."
Bart,Oh. I'm out of money.
Bart,"Oh, aw, man, how are we supposed to kill the rest of the afternoon?"
Bart,"You know, this is wearing a bit thin."
Bart,Maybe a plane exploded.
Bart,One that's made: entirely out of syrup.
Bart,Just make it happen.
Bart,Wowww... That's good Squishee.
Bart,"OK... We're young, rich and full of sugar. What do we do?"
Bart,"SPRINGFIELD, SPRINGFIELD--!"
Bart,"NEW YORK IS THAT-A-WAY, MAN."
Bart,Ohhh... my head....
Bart,I don't remember anything.
Bart,"Oh, no. I must have joined the Junior Campers!"
Bart,"Boy, a man on a Squishee-bender can sure do some crazy things."
Bart,"Okay look, I made a terrible mistake. I wandered into a Junior Camper recruitment center. But what's done is done. I've made my bed and now I've got to weasel out of it."
Bart,All I've gotta do is take this uniform back after school.
Bart,Yeah. Whatever.
Bart,"Oh no. Woe is me, my precious uniform."
Bart,"Um, Mrs. Krabappel...?"
Bart,"I'd love to stay, but this uniform carries certain responsibilities."
Bart,Enjoy your test.
Bart,"Hel-lo, alternative to testing!"
Bart,Nooo!
Bart,"I'm outta here, man."
Bart,You guys get to play with knives?
Bart,Cool! A spork!
Bart,"Aw, who needs a cruddy knife anyway?"
Bart,Knives are boring.
Bart,Seems like everywhere I look people are enjoying knives.
Bart,Don't Do What Donny Don't Does. They could've made this clearer.
Bart,They won't let you have any fun.
Bart,Rubber knife? This place is for wimps.
Bart,Hmmm...
Bart,"The guys who wrote this show don't know squat. Itchy should have tied Scratchy's tongue with a taut-line hitch, not a sheet-bend."
Bart,"You know-it-know it, Neddy."
Bart,"Oh, no. Me bring Homer on a rafting trip?"
Bart,"Actually, we were just planing the father-son river rafting trip."
Bart,"Look, Homer won't want to go, so just ask him, and he'll say no. Then it'll be his fault."
Bart,"Dad, I really want you to come on this trip with me!"
Bart,Homer! No!
Bart,"Well, at least Ned is trying! What are you doing to help?"
Bart,STOP IT! / STOP IT! / DAD!
Bart,A rescue plane! Get the flare gun!
Bart,"Dad, I think he's oka--"
Bart,A real Swiss army knife. Cool!
Bart,"Dad, I know I've been a little hard on you the last couple of days. If I had the strength to lift my arms, I'd give you a hug."
Bart,"Dad, don't take this wrong, but your expression doesn't fill me with confidence."
Bart,"Hey, wait! I smell hamburgers too."
Bart,"You did it, Dad! You saved us! I'm proud you're my father."
Bart,The beauty of it is each parking space is a mere one foot narrower. Indistinguishable to the naked eye. But therein lies the game.
Bart,God bless America.
Bart,"Oh, I couldn't read it. The letters are all blurry."
Bart,"You mean it ain't me noggin, it's me peepers? Well that's just loverly."
Bart,I'm a nerd.
Bart,Look everybody! I'm the same person I always was.
Bart,"Hi, Dad."
Bart,"Whoa, what the hell..."
Bart,What is this place?
Bart,Yes!
Bart,"Gentlemen, the nerd you knew is dead. Beat me and you will be beating one of your own."
Bart,I'm Bart.
Bart,Woo Hoo! Jackpot!
Bart,Are you?
Bart,"By the way, your martinis suck!"
Bart,"Ah yeah, welcome... have a lucky day... um hmmm."
Bart,"Hey, how's it goin'?... Hey, good to see you... Tell your friends. Lookin' lucky... Hey, what's happenin'? Love THE jacket."
Bart,"Pipe down, sister. I've gotta book a new act for tonight. Turns out that Liza Minelli impersonator was really Liza Minelli."
Bart,I'm from a casino.
Bart,Dad! We've been robbed!
Bart,And our portable TV!
Bart,The burglar even took my stamp collection.
Bart,"Hey, the burglar left his calling card."
Bart,Wow. It's a crime wave.
Bart,Cool! High-tech security system.
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,"It's not just a megaphone, Dad. It's a RapMaster 2000."
Bart,"I believe you, Dad."
Bart,"Jawohl, mein mommandant."
Bart,"We're having a field trip today. Ah, Lis, won't it be great to cast off the shackles of the soul-crushing hellhole that is Springfield Elementary? Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. Your class isn't going."
Bart,Sounds like another Pulitzer for me to polish.
Bart,"Yo! Lis! Lis! Come back, Lis! Come back!"
Bart,"I know, I'll just do like Lisa and escape into fantasy."
Bart,"Damn TV, you've ruined my imagination just like you've ruined my ability to... to um, uh... oh well."
Bart,Have any of your workers ever had their hands cut off by the machinery?
Bart,...And then the hand started crawling around and tried to strangle everybody?
Bart,Any popped eyeballs?
Bart,I gotta get outta here.
Bart,Aha! The perfect escape!
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Yoink!
Bart,"Here's a Danish, Krusty."
Bart,I stole it from Kent Brockman.
Bart,No.
Bart,I'm Bart Simpson. I saved you from jail.
Bart,I reunited you with your estranged father.
Bart,"Yes, Krusty?"
Bart,"I saved your career, man! Remember your comeback special?"
Bart,I got you that Danish.
Bart,Wow! A big clown hankie!
Bart,Cool!
Bart,"Hi, Homer."
Bart,"Hey, that's my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated, eight-fold, fourteen-gauge box."
Bart,"Well that'll always be the dream, but for now I got a job in the show business. From now on I'll be helping Krusty the clown after school."
Bart,"So, anyway, can I, Mom? Can I take the job?"
Bart,"Dad, I'm asking if I can get a job."
Bart,"Wow, being in show business is like a dream. We're really lucky, aren't we?"
Bart,"I'm telling ya, I do work on the Krusty show. Look at the credits."
Bart,There's my name. Right there. Bart Simpson.
Bart,"Thanks Dad, that's great advice."
Bart,I wish I was dead.
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,Show business sucks. I'm outta here.
Bart,You want me to be on the show?
Bart,Dead?
Bart,I am waiting for a bus.
Bart,I am waiting for a...
Bart,I didn't do it.
Bart,I didn't do it.
Bart,Sure it is. Look at the cover.
Bart,I DIDN'T DO IT / I DIDN'T DO IT.
Bart,"Uh... I never thought I'd say this, but shouldn't we be learning something?"
Bart,I didn't do it?
Bart,Obnoxious fad?
Bart,I'm doing the Conan O'Brien show and I wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about.
Bart,"Dad, there's more to me than just a catchphrase."
Bart,Watch the Conan O'Brien show. You'll see.
Bart,"You know, Conan, I have a lot to say. I'm not just a one line wonder. Did you know that a section of rainforest the size of Kansas is burned every single..."
Bart,I didn't do it.
Bart,Do the line. Just do the line. What's gonna happen to me?
Bart,Yargghh!
Bart,No!
Bart,"You're right, mom. I shouldn't let this bother me. I'm in television now. It's my job to be repetitive... my job, my job. Repetitiveness is my job. I am gonna go out there tonight and give the best performance of my life."
Bart,The best performance of my life.
Bart,I didn't do it!
Bart,I didn't do it.
Bart,Woozle wozzle.
Bart,What happened?
Bart,Finished?
Bart,"Boy, show business is kinda cruel, isn't it?"
Bart,"Thanks, Mom."
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,"Yeah, delicious corn."
Bart,And he taught me how to do this.
Bart,I got out of school because I told them I was mangled in a car wreck.
Bart,LET'S HURL A BRICKY-MART!
Bart,"Right on! Say it, sister!"
Bart,Just what I was gonna say.
Bart,"Yeah, you made us march in that Gay Rights Parade."
Bart,How about me?
Bart,"How about ""Blabbermouth -- The Jerky Doll for Jerks?"""
Bart,"Wendy Windbag? ""Ugly Doris""? ""Hortense: The Mule-faced Doll""?"
Bart,"No! ""Loudmouth Lisa!"""
Bart,Stupid Lisa Garbageface! I can't stand this any longer! Somebody please pay attention to me!
Bart,Hello! Pay attention to me! Look at me! I'm Bart! I'm Bart! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
Bart,Wow! Did you actually get to see the rod?
Bart,"Oh no, not another boring space launch! Change the channel! Change the channel!"
Bart,"Wow! My father, an astronaut! I feel so full of... what's the opposite of shame?"
Bart,"No, not that far from shame."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"Go, Dad! Go!"
Bart,"Aww, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod."
Bart,"Eh, he knows how I feel."
Bart,"Hey, Dad... sell you these for fifty bucks."
Bart,"Well, your father was a loser. And his father. And his father. It's genetic, man."
Bart,Hey.
Bart,"The Flanders are a buncha geeks, man."
Bart,"No way, José !"
Bart,Ay caramba!
Bart,"Aw it's okay, there's no sugar in pixie sticks. Trust me."
Bart,Yeah!
Bart,"I don't get it, Lis. You said everything would be back to normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends."
Bart,After breakfast me and Milhouse are goin' down to the ravine. We got a tip from a six year old that there's a dead Martian down there.
Bart,Think you'll win?
Bart,"Gotcha. Well, gotta go."
Bart,"Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom."
Bart,I'm tired. I'm hungry. Can't we just buy a new house?
Bart,"Amen, Ernie."
Bart,KBBL is gonna give me something stupid!
Bart,"Can't tie up the line, Grampa."
Bart,KBBL is gonna give me something stupid!
Bart,I won! I won!
Bart,Where's my elephant?!
Bart,"Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty. But I think I'm gonna have to go with the elephant."
Bart,I want the elephant.
Bart,"Eh, either way."
Bart,Umm... No.
Bart,"Uh, gentlemen, I am not leaving without my elephant."
Bart,Hey!
Bart,Where's my elephant!
Bart,Where's my elephant!
Bart,Where's my elephant?!
Bart,Whoa!
Bart,"He smells worse than anything! Hey, you! Elephant! Lift me up on your back, man."
Bart,Cool! He tried to kill me!
Bart,"Look, he thinks he's people."
Bart,I think I'm gonna call him Stampy.
Bart,"Strip the bark now, Stampy."
Bart,"G'night, Stampy."
Bart,"Thanks, bud. 'Preciate it."
Bart,Nah. He doesn't want to learn and I don't want to teach him. We get along fine.
Bart,"Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little."
Bart,You'll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week.
Bart,"Uh, here's a better sign, Dad."
Bart,You guys don't understand Stampy. He's just like me. We're a pair of jokers and both of us are wild. We don't take nothin' from nobody.
Bart,"No, Dad, he's my friend!"
Bart,"Dad, you can't do this. Stampy is my friend."
Bart,"Don't worry, Stampy. I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer."
Bart,"You and I are gonna run away together. We'll keep to the back roads, and make our way South. Then, if I know my geography, it's just twelve miles to Africa. Okay bud, very quietly, let's just sneak through..."
Bart,Stampy!
Bart,"Stampy! Stampy! Where are you, boy?"
Bart,He's gone forever.
Bart,Stampy!
Bart,"Ahhh. You're lonely for other elephants, aren't you?"
Bart,"Dad, I can't let you sell him. Stampy and I are friends."
Bart,"Ow. Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge."
Bart,Even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
Bart,"Stampy, quick! Pull him out!"
Bart,"Thanks, Dad."
Bart,"Uh, Mom. We're stuck to Dad."
Bart,So long Stampy. I know you're gonna like it here.
Bart,"No, Stampy. No!"
Bart,"Ah, thanks, boy."
Bart,"Whoa! Whoa, boy!"
Bart,"Atta boy, Stampy. Butt 'em once for me!"
Bart,"I just don't want to be here, Dad. Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on."
Bart,"Hello, Mr... Kurns? I bad want... money now. Me sick."
Bart,"So pick, please, me... Mr. Burns."
Bart,Ow!
Bart,Huh?
Bart,That explains his mysterious trip to Holland.
Bart,Well...
Bart,All right.
Bart,Whoa.
Bart,"Um, uh, I think I'd like to go home."
Bart,"Anything, huh? Okay... I want pizza, and I want it delivered by Krusty the Clown."
Bart,"Hey, wait! How can you be here when your show's on live?"
Bart,"...And I had the greatest time. Mr. Burns' house has everything - a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors, and a bottomless pit."
Bart,"Well, for all intents and purposes."
Bart,Mr. Burns throws peas at Smithers.
Bart,"Oh yuck, meatloaf! My most hated of all loafs."
Bart,No! This family stinks. Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side. I'm suffocating here.
Bart,"Oh, go eat some flowers."
Bart,I want to stay here with Mr. Burns.
Bart,Beats me. But it won't be back for three hours and forty minutes. Once it had snow on it.
Bart,"Uh, Milhouse, if you stay a little while longer, you can have this blazer. It's a Bob Mackie original."
Bart,For me? But I don't know how to drive.
Bart,That was some ride.
Bart,"Um, I'd kind of like to go home now."
Bart,"Mr. Burns, I don't want to seem ungrateful. But, I want to go home to my family."
Bart,It's probably my imagination but something about them didn't seem quite right.
Bart,That's them all right. I can't believe it. I guess you're the only one I can trust...
Bart,... Dad.
Bart,It's a little tight.
Bart,Excellent.
Bart,Let me try one.
Bart,Homer!
Bart,"I'm sorry, Dad... You're fired!"
Bart,A little to the left.
Bart,How do you know?
Bart,I love you guys.
Bart,They're gonna eat this up at Show and Tell.
Bart,"Not likely. C'mon, have a sense of humor about yourself!"
Bart,Argh! I gotta find something else quick!
Bart,"Mom, you're always trying to give me potatoes. What is it with you?"
Bart,I need something for Show and Tell.
Bart,I'll be right back.
Bart,"Boys and girls, Mrs. Krabappel, I come before you today to solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries -- What has four legs and ticks?"
Bart,"What? No, it's my dog!"
Bart,"My dog's name is Santa's Little Helper. One time he crawled under the house, and when he came out he was covered with ants. Then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water."
Bart,"I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner left, but now all I have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head."
Bart,"Yeah, I guess it is guilt."
Bart,"Well, yeah, but --"
Bart,"Principal Skinner... Um, I'm real sorry about my dog getting you fired, and biting you, and then getting it on with your leg."
Bart,Mufft a been a co-in-fa-dince.
Bart,"Um, it's, it's a lot of fun."
Bart,"Well, it was good to see you."
Bart,"Uh, no."
Bart,"Uh, I'm kinda busy on Saturday."
Bart,"Uh, no I'll pass. Hey, what's this?"
Bart,"Yeah, and the teachers are afraid to leave the faculty lounge."
Bart,"Uh, I thought I heard someone say your name in the cafeteria, but they might've been saying ""skim milk."""
Bart,"Yeah, great."
Bart,"Don't you see, Milhouse? We've gone too far. We need Skinner back."
Bart,Table for one.
Bart,"It's weird, Lis. I miss him as a friend, but I miss him even more as an enemy."
Bart,"If there was some way to get rid of Flanders, would you want to come back?"
Bart,"Oh, I think I can get him fired. I got you fired, didn't I?"
Bart,"Hmm, that's probably never gonna happen."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"Well, once he found out we were going to get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping."
Bart,"Here's the plan. Once Chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten, he'll fire Ned on the spot."
Bart,No problem-o. Just make a pass at your commanding officer.
Bart,"C'mon, Chalmie. You fired Skinner for less than this."
Bart,So I guess we're enemies again.
Bart,Sure.
Bart,How can they imprison kids in school on a beautiful day like this?
Bart,"A prison bus, Otto?"
Bart,"Ah! This is what being a kid is all about. Hey, Huck. What's L-I-N-C-O-N doin' here?"
Bart,"Hi, Abe."
Bart,"Ah, the joys of mortgaging your future."
Bart,My fantasy's come true.
Bart,That does it. I'm outta here.
Bart,"Mrs. Krabappel, I have to go to the dentist. I have a caraway seed caught under my bridgework."
Bart,My mom's number is on there if you want to check up on me.
Bart,"Look, if I was under seventeen, I'd be in school, right?"
Bart,Can't let Dad see me playing hooky.
Bart,Good afternoon.
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,Let's see him track me now.
Bart,"Oh, my God, he is like some sort of non... giving up... school guy."
Bart,I'm one of your nephews you don't see very often. Bart-Bart.
Bart,"Hey McBain, I'm a big fan, but your last movie really sucked."
Bart,"Wow! This is the biggest Rice Krispy square I've ever seen. Boy, the rich sure know how to live."
Bart,"Ah, that's gotta hoit!"
Bart,But Freddy Quimby's innocent.
Bart,"Oh, yeah. Right."
Bart,"Well they didn't, okay? They didn't! It says right here in black and white, no witnesses. Case closed. Now let's all read the funnies."
Bart,"Oh look, Charlie Brown said ""Good grief."" I didn't see that comin'."
Bart,"Lisa, I gotta tell somebody. I was at the Quimby compound yesterday when that frog waiter got whacked. I know that Freddy Quimby is innocent."
Bart,I can't.
Bart,What he said.
Bart,"Ya see, Lisa? They don't need my testimony."
Bart,The system works. Just ask Claus Von Bulow.
Bart,Maybe I should come forward.
Bart,"What? Uh, um, yeah. Uh, I just want to say how great it is to finally see some chicks on the bench."
Bart,"Keep up the good work, toots."
Bart,"Sell it to Hallmark, sis. You're lookin' at cucumber boy. As in ""cool as a."""
Bart,"Mom, what if there's a really bad, crummy guy who's going to jail, but I know he's innocent?"
Bart,"Mom, Mom, Mom!"
Bart,What if I can get this guy off the hook. Sh-should I do it?
Bart,"Well, I was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened..."
Bart,And that's what really happened.
Bart,I sorta skipped school.
Bart,"I guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?"
Bart,Shouldn't we wait for the other babies before we open the presents?
Bart,Don't forget to give her Smeckler's Powder!
Bart,FAT KIDS...
Bart,KIDS WHO CLIMB ON ROCKS...
Bart,SISSY KIDS...
Bart,Ooh.
Bart,"Pardon me, sir. Forgive my clumsiness."
Bart,"Ah, yes, my name is Homer Simpson, and I'd like to order an Itchy an Scratchy cel. My credit card? Ah, do you accept the Federal Breast Inspector's card? License to Ogle? Viza?... Oh yes, of course, that's what I meant, Visa. It's these new dentures."
Bart,He's damn opposed! Damn! Damn! Damn opposed!
Bart,That's me.
Bart,Um... that's me.
Bart,Go away!
Bart,Thanks.
Bart,"Hey, Lis, guess who's got a genuine Itchy and Scratchy animation cel?!"
Bart,"Oh, no. I used Dad's credit card to buy this?"
Bart,Three hundred fifty dollars.
Bart,Is this cel worth anything?
Bart,Can't you give me anything for it?
Bart,"Hi. You know, Gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me. She especially likes it when they give me money."
Bart,"Very well, you leave me no choice."
Bart,This gun is filled with ketchup. This one with mustard. Now give me three hundred fifty bucks or you're gonna be a mess for your date.
Bart,"Dad, I'm really sorry, but I charged three hundred fifty dollars on your credit card."
Bart,"Don't worry, here's the cash."
Bart,But Dad...
Bart,"Oh well, he's happy. I'm gonna keep this Mary Worth phone right here. Her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again."
Bart,Sure!
Bart,"Yeah, but his reply envelope just had a check to the Gas Company in it."
Bart,Buh.
Bart,"Well, me and Milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer."
Bart,What the hell are you talkin' about? You're the one who double dared us.
Bart,I'm outta here!
Bart,"Wow, I've never seen Mom so mad at Homer before."
Bart,"Earth base, this is commander Bart McCool. We are under attack by the Zorrinid Brain Changers! Quickly, into the safety dome, Milbot!"
Bart,"Look, Dad. I missed you so much, I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an ""F""."
Bart,"Oh, sorry. Here's a fresh one."
Bart,"Homer, my hat goes off to you."
Bart,"Look, Lis, I snatched five bathing suits. All Martin's!"
Bart,"So long, Lis. I'm gonna stow away underwater, and go where the pool goes. Have a good life."
Bart,"Oh well. Same time tomorrow, Otto?"
Bart,"Friends and well-wishers, yes."
Bart,"People, people, it's time we all discussed the pool safety rules."
Bart,You got it.
Bart,It is?!!
Bart,YAAARRRGG!!
Bart,I'm gonna miss the whole summer.
Bart,"Hey, guys! Sign my cast? Sign my cast? Guys...?"
Bart,Milhouse!
Bart,"Faithful Milhouse. You'll spend the long, hot days by my side, won't you?"
Bart,But you're wearing your glasses.
Bart,"Aw, great. I get to spend the summer with my brain."
Bart,"What fun can you have in a pool, anyway, that you can't have in a bathtub with a garbage bag taped around your cast?"
Bart,"Traitors. Go on and have your pool. I'm fine by myself, right here."
Bart,"You know, this isn't so bad. I'll just spend the summer getting better acquainted with an old friend called Television."
Bart,Wow. The universe is so boring.
Bart,I swear I don't know where the bombs are! Only the Miners know that! Maybe this will loosen your tongue! No! Blah!!
Bart,Don't turn on that light!!
Bart,I'm fine. Just fine.
Bart,"Uh, no."
Bart,Gimme that! It's a work in progress. So. How do you like being Miss Popularity?
Bart,There was an Optics Festival and I wasn't informed? You go now.
Bart,Go!
Bart,"What have we here... ""The Lighter Side of Hippies"". They don't care whose toes they step on. ."
Bart,"I know, I'll use this to peer into Springfield's seamy underbelly."
Bart,I'm never ever gonna see anything interesting with this stupid piece of junk.
Bart,That came from Flanders' house.
Bart,Can't be what it looks like. This is Flanders we're talkin' about.
Bart,"Ah, I'll just watch some TV."
Bart,"Uh, uh, noo. This can't be what it looks like. There's gotta be some other explanation."
Bart,Then that's not the real Ned Flanders.
Bart,"If that's not Flanders, he's done his homework!"
Bart,"He's gonna kill Rod and Todd, too... That's horrible. In principle."
Bart,"Listen, Ned Flanders murdered his wife."
Bart,Sure. That was twenty minutes ago.
Bart,You can start makin' it up to me right now. Flanders is leaving the house. I want you to sneak in there and bring me back some evidence... and something sweet for later.
Bart,"All right. You're right, you're right. Let's-let's just forget about that. Let me read to you from my play. ""Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga? Is it St. Swivens day already?"" ""'Tis,"" replied Aunt Helga."
Bart,A human head!
Bart,"Of course. Oh no. He's back. Flanders is back! Lisa, get outta there!"
Bart,"No, Lisa, don't go upstairs. You'll be trapped!"
Bart,"An axe! He's got an axe. I'll save you, Lisa!"
Bart,Uh... I'll save you by calling the police.
Bart,"I'll save you, cast or no cast!"
Bart,"Gotta save Lisa, trash can or no trash can!"
Bart,Nooooo!
Bart,I came to stop you from murdering Lisa like you murdered your wife.
Bart,But I distinctly heard you say that Maude was with God.
Bart,"But I saw the murder, and then I saw you bury the corpse in the backyard."
Bart,But I heard a woman scream.
Bart,"Oh, well I guess that explains everything."
Bart,"Lisa, will you keep it down!? I'm making a crank phone call to Principal Skinner."
Bart,"Oh, yeah? Well, I can do what I want in my room."
Bart,I can keep this up all day.
Bart,Hurry up and finish eating!
Bart,Oh!
Bart,Whoa!
Bart,"Homer, that was downright decent of you."
Bart,"Dad, isn't this stealing?"
Bart,Hell-o. First born within earshot.
Bart,"I can't stand to see you so miserable, Lis, unless it's from a rubber spider down your dress. Hmmm. That gives me an idea."
Bart,Note for later. Put rubber spider down Lisa's dress.
Bart,"Hey, I know... How about if I dig up some dirt on Allison? Remember how I got Milhouse's picture on America's Most Wanted?"
Bart,"Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's my card."
Bart,Note: Next year order fewer cards.
Bart,"Lis, I did some checkin' on this Allison character and I know it's against all your moral fibers..."
Bart,"Yep, she's clean as a bean. But, I did tip off the Feds as to the whereabouts of our good friend, Milhouse."
Bart,"Way to go, Lis. I mean, why compete with someone who's just gonna kick your butt anyway?"
Bart,Uh oh!
Bart,"Well, the important thing is that we survived."
Bart,"Well sure there is... ... but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit devious, a bit, as the French say, ""Bartesque."""
Bart,"Then welcome to the nether regions of the soul. Now here's what we do. Tomorrow morning when Allison comes out of her house, we spray her with the hose, soaking her from head to toe, leaving us relatively dry."
Bart,"Well, there's bound to be some splashback."
Bart,"Well, we could just sabotage her diorama, humiliating her in front of the students and faculty."
Bart,Leaving her primed for the most traumatic hose-soaking of her life.
Bart,"Lisa, here is as the French say, ""le fake diorama."" I'll create a diversion and you make the switch."
Bart,"Hey, everybody, whoa, look at me. I'm over here. Turn this way right now."
Bart,It's a cow's heart. They're trying to make a monkey outta you!
Bart,Right on!
Bart,"You're a shoo-in now, Lis."
Bart,"You mean ""shining."""
Bart,It's a new episode.
Bart,Really?
Bart,"No need, Mom. We already learned in school."
Bart,Bo-ring.
Bart,Hmmm.
Bart,"Hello, is Al there?"
Bart,"Yeah, Al. Last name Caholic."
Bart,What happened to Mindy?
Bart,"Watch this, Lis. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half."
Bart,"A-a-a-a-and, now."
Bart,"Yes, I do. The only girl I ever loved invited me up to the treehouse. She had something very important to tell me."
Bart,"Wait, that did end in heartbreak. Thanks for opening up old wounds, you ma."
Bart,I learned it screws everybody up.
Bart,"But now Itchy & Scratchy Land is cutting ticket prices in half. Can we go, Dad? Can we can we can we, take it, Lis."
Bart,Mom! Guess what!
Bart,"That's right, dead serious about going to Itchy and Scratchy Land."
Bart,"Don't worry, Mom. We'll make you proud of us."
Bart,Agreed.
Bart,"Dad, can we stop at Flickey's?"
Bart,Whew. I'm glad that wasn't us.
Bart,"Do it, Dad."
Bart,"Yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is actually beneficial for children."
Bart,Ow!
Bart,"I'll have the brain burger with extra pus, please."
Bart,"I was just ordering a cheeseburger, Mom. They have violent names for everything here."
Bart,"Wow, this is so much like my dreams it's scary."
Bart,"Look at all this great stuff, Lis. Cool, personalized plates."
Bart,"Barclay, Barry, Bert, Bort?! Aw, c'mon, Bort?"
Bart,"Well you're probably too young to remember the short-lived Itchy & Scratchy and Friends Hour. They had to come up with some friends. There's Disgruntled Goat, Uncle Ant, Klu Klux Clam..."
Bart,"I don't know, Disgruntled Goat had his moments."
Bart,Wanna get a snow cone?
Bart,"So, Mr. Itchy. You think you're God's gift to women, do ya?"
Bart,Can you believe I keep gettin' away with this... Officer?
Bart,Dad?
Bart,"Yeah. There's just no way to resist it, is there?"
Bart,"A chopper, we're saved!"
Bart,I'll get more cameras!
Bart,"Smashie, smashie."
Bart,Sideshow Bob! I'm only ten and I already got two mortal enemies.
Bart,"Hey, mouse! Say cheese. Hmm... with a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero."
Bart,Who would've thought that our visit to Itchy and Scratchy Land would turn out to be our best vacation ever.
Bart,But it would be funny to someone who was watching us.
Bart,Ow!
Bart,"You think you're so big 'cause your class always gets to do projects. Well, um... I'm doing a school project on, uh, fireworks!"
Bart,Nooooo!!
Bart,Eep.
Bart,I can do that.
Bart,"Hey, Four-eyes! Vote Quimby! Hey, Beard-o! Vote Quimby!"
Bart,Don't worry. He's taken a million of these capsules.
Bart,"Good line, though."
Bart,You mean I have to repeat the fourth grade?
Bart,Kindergarten?
Bart,Triangle.
Bart,Cool! I call the Flintstone Phone!
Bart,So whoever it is who wrote that note wants to meet us here tonight?
Bart,"Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading Archie comics."
Bart,How the hell do you know?
Bart,But dad can't afford six dollars a night.
Bart,Heyyy...
Bart,Lis! Lis! C'mere! I found him! I found Edgar Neubauer!
Bart,Oh my God! The dead have risen and they're voting Republican!
Bart,"Hey, uh, he did try to kill me..."
Bart,You were just Barlow's lackey!
Bart,Sonny to his Cher!
Bart,We want the truth!
Bart,Aww. Tomorrow we were gonna find out who the dish ran away with.
Bart,Of course!
Bart,"Hey, I found a short cut through your hedgemaze."
Bart,What's haggis?
Bart,"Don't worry, Mom. I can use my ""shinning"" to call Willie."
Bart,"Homer, change channel!"
Bart,"Dad, it's in there again!"
Bart,"Don't you remember, Dad? Flanders is the unquestioned lord and master of the world."
Bart,"Join us, Father."
Bart,"Hey, there's a bug that looks like dad. Let's kill it."
Bart,"Good morning, father dear. Hope you're well."
Bart,Hey everybody! Let's all turn our desks backwards before Mrs. Krabappel shows up!
Bart,Eh?
Bart,"Hmm, I wonder where Jimbo is today. He should've beaten us up for our lunch money an hour ago."
Bart,But Mom!
Bart,"Don't worry, guys. Something always comes along to save us."
Bart,"Nevertheless, I remain confident that something will come along and save the two Simpson children."
Bart,Huh?
Bart,"All right, ""Thinks Too Much,"" it shall be so."
Bart,"Throw down your weapons and kiss the prairie, cowdorks."
Bart,"That's not fair, Nelson. They didn't have the Killmatic 3,000 back then."
Bart,"Why the crap do we have to go to church, anyway?"
Bart,I'M A TROLL MAN / DA DA DA DA DA DA DA/ I'M A TROLL MAN...
Bart,"Wow, there is a God."
Bart,I've never felt this way about a girl before. My long search is finally over.
Bart,Hi. I'm Bart Simpson. I was incredibly moved by your reading. I don't think God's words have ever sounded so plausible.
Bart,"Is it my hair? My overbite? The fact that I've worn the same clothes, day in, day out, for the last four years?"
Bart,"Yes Ma'am. I'd like to return to your wonderful Sunday school, please."
Bart,"I've changed my ways. Please give me another chance, ma'am."
Bart,"You know, the great thing about Sunday school is we're finally learning something we can use."
Bart,"Somehow I gotta convince her I'm a good person. All right, I have to sit here and behave no matter what."
Bart,Must... fight... Satan. Make it... up to him... later.
Bart,You know I was considering staying after school and helping teacher clean up.
Bart,There is just no pleasing a girl like that. All that unnecessary behaving... I'm all tensed through the chestal area. I need relief.
Bart,That'll hold me. At least 'til I get my hands on some kind of explosives.
Bart,No I'm not. I'm really...
Bart,Three months .
Bart,"Really? Uh, sure."
Bart,There's only one thing to do at a moment like this... strut.
Bart,"Well, in my family, grades aren't that important. It's what you learn that counts."
Bart,"Um, actually, numbers don't have much use in my future career. Olympic gold medal rocket sled champ."
Bart,"Well no offense, lady, but what you don't know could fill a warehouse."
Bart,"Sorry, I have kind of a short fuse, which some find charming. Speaking of charming, watching Fox last night, I heard a rather amusing story... This character named Martin was feeling rather randy and he was heard to remark..."
Bart,"But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but..."
Bart,O-kay.
Bart,"I'm bad to the bone, honey."
Bart,But your father said...
Bart,"Smart, beautiful, and a liar! So much better than that Sarah, plain and tall."
Bart,"Right there, put it right there. Oh, excellent. You're incredible, Jessica. Your throws, your catches, your spirals, your loops, it's like the toilet paper is an extension of your body."
Bart,Oh yeah? I'll prove it.
Bart,"Hey, Jessica."
Bart,Jessica we just...
Bart,Why?
Bart,I guess.
Bart,"Um, actually, I was hoping I could sit down for just a second."
Bart,Wow. Now I have the energy to do anything!
Bart,Just give me two minutes.
Bart,"Jessica, I think this is too steep."
Bart,"Actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity, I just might be able to hold on."
Bart,"Oh, the glue will slow me down."
Bart,Nothin's ever gonna stop me.
Bart,Nooooo!
Bart,"Uh, we should get to class."
Bart,We could get in trouble for being late.
Bart,"She's like a Milk Dud, Lis. Sweet on the outside, poison on the inside."
Bart,"No, no, wait. Hear my plan. I put up with her for seven more years. Then, we'll get married. Once the first baby comes along, she's bound to settle down and start treatin' me right. After all, I deserve it."
Bart,"You're right, Lisa -- love isn't about fixing someone. I'm just going to give her up cold turkey. I'm not gonna talk to her or see her. It's over. Thanks for the advice, sis."
Bart,"There. If I can just get through this many days without seeing her, she should be completely out of my system. Okay, day one."
Bart,Jessica...
Bart,"Oh Lis, she's already drawing me to her with her beautiful siren song."
Bart,That's very disturbing.
Bart,"Well, Jessica, I don't think we should hang out together anymore. You're turning me into a criminal when all I want to be is a petty thug."
Bart,"Jessica, what are you doing!"
Bart,But stealing from the collection basket is really wrong. Even I know that.
Bart,I...
Bart,I didn't take it.
Bart,No.
Bart,We've gotta talk.
Bart,"Well, it seems like if you really care for me, you should come forward."
Bart,That doesn't make any sense.
Bart,"Jessica, you're really beautiful, but you are not very nice."
Bart,"You know, with the way you're treating me, why should I protect you?"
Bart,Huh?
Bart,Yeah. This is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople.
Bart,"Give it up, Lis. She's a criminal mastermind. She's got a 108 IQ, she reads at a fifth grade level, and her hair smells like red Fruit Loops."
Bart,That's okay. 'Preciate it... Mm Hmm.
Bart,"Hi, Jessica."
Bart,"I just wanted to let you know that even though this was a difficult experience, I really learned a lot... I'm a little wiser and a little less naïve."
Bart,"Well, don't you see, Jessica, then you really haven't learned --"
Bart,Will I!
Bart,Poor sucker. It's amazing what some guys will do for a pretty face. Not me though. Wait'll she sees the second rate job I do on these stairs. .
Bart,"Ah, Action News, the last place an impressionable kid can go for TV violence."
Bart,"All right, snow day! No school tomorrow!"
Bart,"Lisa, that man is a professional meteorologist."
Bart,You're gonna eat a blizzard of...
Bart,Unseasonable warmth...?
Bart,Of course she did. Who else would have?
Bart,I'm saved! I love being a S-s-s-simpson!
Bart,Huh?!
Bart,"Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't..."
Bart,"Well, I could use a new pair of hockey skates."
Bart,...Dad.
Bart,"Aw thanks, Dad."
Bart,How about some adulation from my li'l sister?
Bart,"Ah, you're just jealous..."
Bart,Because - you - stink - at - sports...
Bart,"Mom, will you stop showin' us those?"
Bart,"Maybe I will, Milhouse, maybe I will."
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,"Come watch TV with me, Dad. We missed the first two episodes of Cops, but if we hurry we can catch the last three."
Bart,"I dunno, Mom."
Bart,Ow.
Bart,"Hello, queen Lisa."
Bart,"Lisa, certain differences, rivalries, if you will, have come up between us. At first I thought we can talk it over like civilized people. But instead, I just ripped the head off Mr. Honeybunny."
Bart,Mr. Honeybunny!
Bart,Hey! It's a free country. You get out.
Bart,"I know you are, but what am I?"
Bart,"Okay, but on my way, I'm gonna be doing this."
Bart,"If you get hit, it's your own fault."
Bart,"Mom, that is really annoying."
Bart,"Uh uh, Lisa started it."
Bart,"You go, Mom. For the greater good."
Bart,"Good luck tonight, sis. I'll try not to hurt you."
Bart,Mr. Honeybunny! You inhuman monster!
Bart,"Hey, Mom! Look at me, Mom!"
Bart,"Great game, Lis."
Bart,Damn FDA. Why can't it all be marshmallow?
Bart,CanIcometothecandyshow!?CanIcome!? CanIcome!?
Bart,Please the hobo. Please the hobo. Please the hobo.
Bart,Mom! How can you leave us with this maniac?!
Bart,"So, you're one of those ""don't call me a chick"" chicks, huh?"
Bart,"Disemboweler 4, the game where condemned criminals dig at each other with rusty hooks."
Bart,No waaaay. Gg-aah... Yes'm.
Bart,Ow.
Bart,"Hey Lis, I found a big caramel deposit at the small of her back!"
Bart,Why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt? That's where cooties come from.
Bart,"Oh, yeah. That was brilliant."
Bart,"And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal, Dad?"
Bart,"We know you're innocent, Dad."
Bart,It's just hard not to listen to TV. It's spent so much more time raising us than you have.
Bart,Wow. V8 juice isn't one-eighth gasoline.
Bart,Mom!! Dad!!
Bart,There's a U.F.O. outside my window!! Seriously!
Bart,C-c-can I sleep in there with you guys tonight?
Bart,Can I sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a U.F.O. does come?
Bart,"Hi, guys. Whatcha lookin' at?"
Bart,I'm getting this book on U.F.O.s.
Bart,"Did you know they're real, but there's a huge government conspiracy to cover it up?"
Bart,I'unno.
Bart,"Listen to this. ""Unexplainable Behavior. Individuals acting in a secretive fashion are often involved with UFOs, or other paranormal phenomena, e.g. telephone explosions."""
Bart,"Scary, no? And this guy's head of the Spaceology Department at the Correspondence College of Tampa!"
Bart,Okay. It's now painfully clear. The adults are definitely paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people.
Bart,So what's the simplest explanation?
Bart,"So, finally, we're all in agreement about what's going on with the adults. Milhouse?"
Bart,Thank you.
Bart,"Dad, number one: I know how to ride a bike. Number two: I already own a bike. And number three: that is a girl's bike."
Bart,"No offense, Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting."
Bart,"I'm sure he meant to say ""serious drinking."""
Bart,"Cheer up, Homer."
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Right here, Dad."
Bart,Alaska!
Bart,"Oh, great. I specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby."
Bart,"I come for the service, but I stay for the leg room."
Bart,"You know, I have this feeling that we forgot something..."
Bart,"So much for the days when I could say ""at least my mother's normal."""
Bart,I don't believe it! Principal Skinner!
Bart,"Well, well, well. I never thought I'd win this easy."
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Hi, Dad."
Bart,"A conspiracy, eh? You think they might be involved in the Kennedy assassination in some way?"
Bart,"We can? Thanks, Mom."
Bart,"Dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore Grampa?"
Bart,Maybe we should be listening to him now.
Bart,"Same old space, huh, Dad?"
Bart,Every week there's a canal.
Bart,Or a fjord.
Bart,"Says you, woman."
Bart,Wow. Two.
Bart,Oh please.
Bart,"Get the camera ready, Bart very seepy."
Bart,You're a pin-monkey? Wow. Finally I don't have to be ashamed of my father's job.
Bart,"Been there, done that."
Bart,"You know nothin' about genetics, Lis. It goes boy, girl, boy, girl."
Bart,"Wow, Dad. You really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?"
Bart,"Dad, you can't expect a person to sit for thirty minutes straight."
Bart,"Okay, but I know funny."
Bart,Then why no pictures?
Bart,Yay! Go weather balloon! Hurrah for science! Woo!
Bart,I don't think I really captured the eyes.
Bart,And you've never found anything?
Bart,"Empty my pockets you say? Well, certainly, but I fail to see how..."
Bart,"Race you to Utah, Milhouse."
Bart,There's a four-thirty in the morning now?
Bart,"Mom, will you make me breakfast?"
Bart,Still dark. Better use the generator.
Bart,Is that the telescope we're gonna be looking through?
Bart,Why don't they look anything like their names?
Bart,Who names these things anyway?
Bart,So what am I supposed to do exactly?
Bart,Uh huh.
Bart,Uh huh.
Bart,Hell no.
Bart,Woo! All hands on deck! Pirates off the port bow! Hey!
Bart,"Observatory? This is Bart Simpson. I see something in the sky at... four, twelve, eight, and the last number is seven."
Bart,What didn't I do.
Bart,"But then, you've always been proud of me."
Bart,Uh... I guess so.
Bart,Huh?
Bart,Well I'm done eating. Goodbye.
Bart,There it is right there.
Bart,But you don't need a stupid telescope. It's right there.
Bart,Huh?
Bart,I knew you'd try to find something wrong with my comet Lisa. You've always been petty and small. Right from the beginning.
Bart,"Hey, shut up."
Bart,"Dad, the plan!"
Bart,Dad!
Bart,We're doomed!
Bart,"Wow, Dad. Maybe you're right."
Bart,"It's a cow, man."
Bart,Cool!
Bart,What's really amazing is that this is exactly what Dad said would happen.
Bart,"Yes. He can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle and make it funny."
Bart,I don't think any of us expected him to say that.
Bart,"Dad, you can't just go around pretending to be Krusty. It's sacrilege. He's a one and only. I mean, he invented the pie fight, the prat fall, and the seltzer bottle... as far as I know."
Bart,What's a Chachi?
Bart,"Wow. I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad."
Bart,I have a feeling I could get him to appear at my house.
Bart,I'm more striking than lovely.
Bart,Payroll. Burt Stanton speaking.
Bart,"Go, toothpaste! Go! Move your pasty white butt!"
Bart,No fair! You only won 'cause you had the inside track! If the water was spinning the other way--
Bart,"No way. Water doesn't obey your ""rules."" It goes where it wants. Like me, babe."
Bart,"I know I've seen it go the other way. Ah, faithful toilet. You'll prove me right."
Bart,What the hell is the Southern Hemisphere?
Bart,"Hmm, so down there in, say, Argentina or Rand-McNally all their water runs backwards?"
Bart,Cool.
Bart,"Hello, Southern Hemisphere? Which way does the water go in your toilet?"
Bart,Which way does the water turn in your toilet?
Bart,I can't get a straight answer out of this crazy hemisphere!
Bart,"Hello, operator? I'd like to make a collect call to..."
Bart,Australia.
Bart,"Er, uh, this is Dr. Bart Simpson of the International Drainage Commission. It's an emergency."
Bart,"We understand some drains in your area have been malfunctioning, sucking in people and what-not."
Bart,"Indeed. We need you to check your sinks and toilets and tell us which way the water is going. And, please -- stand clear!"
Bart,"She was right. Stupid Lisa Science Queen. Look, why don't you just check your neighbor's drains. I'll hold."
Bart,Yes. Yes I do.
Bart,Huh?
Bart,"Draining? Oh, I don't care about that anymore."
Bart,Y'ello?
Bart,Uhh... Hold please.
Bart,Bart Simpson's office.
Bart,"One moment, please."
Bart,"This is Bart Simpson. Can I help you, Ma'am?"
Bart,No. You owe me nine hundred dollars.
Bart,"I don't think so. You're all the way in Australia. Hey, I think I hear a dingo eatin' your baby."
Bart,Mr. Simpson... blah blah... misrepresentation over telephone... yadda yadda... Sincerely... Some Australian jerk.
Bart,Nothing. Some stupid country thinks I owe them money.
Bart,"Hey, guys, just so you don't hear any wild rumors... I'm being indicted for fraud in Australia."
Bart,Yes'm.
Bart,I can handle that. I'm an expert at phony apologies.
Bart,I'm sorry.
Bart,What does that sign say? I thought they spoke English in this country!
Bart,Oh.
Bart,"Sorry, girl. I don't wanna get in any more trouble down here."
Bart,I'll pick you up on the way home.
Bart,"I'm way ahead of ya, Dad."
Bart,Yeah. Do the toilets go backwards in here?
Bart,"Hey, G.I. Joe, your sign's broken. We're already in Australia."
Bart,"I get it, Dad."
Bart,That's not a knife. That's a spoon.
Bart,I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did to your country.
Bart,Yuh-oh.
Bart,Hey! We can get away in their pouches!
Bart,Ewww. It's not like in cartoons.
Bart,Liiiiisa!
Bart,"No, Mom... Wait. It's time for me to bend over and receive my destiny."
Bart,And this is for the United States of America.
Bart,"So, uh, what's your hurry to get to school?"
Bart,Rat boy? I resent that.
Bart,"What a day, eh Milhouse? The sun is out, birds are singing, bees are trying to have sex with them - as is my understanding..."
Bart,"You're right, Milhouse. Fun is fun."
Bart,"Aw, who needs him. I can have fun all by myself."
Bart,S'allright?
Bart,S'allright?
Bart,S'allright?
Bart,Oh no. It's P.E. sign up day!
Bart,Ballet? Dancin' is for girls!
Bart,"Okay, steady Bart. Taking ballet doesn't make you any less of a man."
Bart,I don't want to be the next anything. I'm only taking this stupid class because they made me.
Bart,"Look, Boris. I think ballet's for sissies."
Bart,"I don't like wearing tights, ma'am."
Bart,"Look, I don't like this cootie platoon and I never will. I'm outta here and I'm out of this stupid outfit."
Bart,"Wait! Joy of movement increasing... Love of dance, impossible to resist... Toes twinkling... Look at me, girls. I'm doing ballet...and I love it!"
Bart,"See that? I started to do like a little arabesque, but then I just fully went for it and pulled off the demi-entrechant. Not that I'm into that kind of thing."
Bart,Dance in front of my whole school? What is it with you and ballet?
Bart,"No, I fear the girls will laugh at me. I fear the boys will beat the living snot out of me."
Bart,Pretty big crowd.
Bart,Dang.
Bart,"Behold, the masked dancer is me, Bart."
Bart,It is I who have won your acclaim!
Bart,"Go ahead and laugh. But I took a chance and did something I wanted to do. And if that makes me a sissy, well then, I guess I'm a sissy."
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,Why did she just leave me here when I clearly need medical attention?
Bart,No tourists? I'll be ruined.
Bart,Maps to movie stars homes! Mapa por las casas de las cineastas! Top-u stah noh cheezu map-u!
Bart,"I may be just a boy, but I have an idea. If I may, I'd like to show you a few slides."
Bart,Here's Springfield as it appears from space. Somewhere in this windy valley is the Lost Dutchman's Mine.
Bart,"So long, suckers!"
Bart,This is the last time I use a plan devised by Milhouse.
Bart,"Hello, I'm Bart Simpson. In the past, I've brought you such classic films as ""Homer in the Shower,"" and ""Homer on the Toilet."" And now, I give you... ""The Eternal Struggle."""
Bart,Uh oh. I smell another cheap cartoon crossover.
Bart,"Hey man, I really love your show. I think all kids should watch it. I suddenly feel so dirty."
Bart,"You bad-mouthed McGyver, didn't you?"
Bart,You made a movie?
Bart,"Nah, we're not gonna be doing that."
Bart,"Oh, these Renaissance Faires are so boring."
Bart,Meh.
Bart,"Hi, Mom. Aw, that's great news about Lisa. Well listen, I'd better get to get back to work."
Bart,"Heh, heh. They're finally paying me for this."
Bart,Oh yeah!
Bart,Here they come! Raise the flag!
Bart,"Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. I also crush cars into cubes. And on the side, I promote local tough man contests. Basically I'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til I go to law school."
Bart,Ow! Hey watch those virtual darts. I'm trying to play virtual pool!
Bart,"Wow, Lisa. Looking at you makes me want to get married for a third time. I met a really nice exotic dancer the other night at Hugh's bachelor party."
Bart,We had one in his honor. I had one in his honor. I went to a strip club.
Bart,"Oh, please! This is senseless destruction, with none of my usual social commentary."
Bart,"I don't know why you're so energetic today, boy, but prepare to be worn out."
Bart,My strobe light!
Bart,Please?
Bart,Hey!
Bart,"Look, he's heading back to the greyhound racing track where we found him!"
Bart,It's Santa's Little Helper!
Bart,"It looks like he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite make it. Come on, boy, you can do it!"
Bart,"Hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?"
Bart,"Me and Santa's Little Helper used to be a team, but he never wants to play anymore since his bitch moved in!"
Bart,Well that's what she is! I looked it up.
Bart,Hey look! A really small dog just fell out of Santa's girlfriend.
Bart,Two sets of twins and a triplet!
Bart,"Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four..."
Bart,Twenty-five.
Bart,An army of dogs! No bully will ever touch me again!
Bart,"Hey, jerkface! You have the face of a jerk!"
Bart,"Get 'em, boys!"
Bart,"Say, Jimbo ... hope I wasn't out of line with that ""jerkface"" crack."
Bart,"Agh, my socks!"
Bart,"Yeah, they ate all my socks! I have to wear Lisa's to school today!"
Bart,"Well, I have to coordinate, don't I?"
Bart,We don't have to wait for the cops - who can track the puppies better than their own mom and dad?
Bart,Sorry. You've gotta admit it's catchy.
Bart,We've gotta get the dogs outta there!
Bart,"Hush, puppies!"
Bart,"I know, the window!"
Bart,Dogs always land on their feet.
Bart,"No, it's dogs. I'll prove it."
Bart,Best two out of three.
Bart,"Okay guys, let's move!"
Bart,Come on! Come on!
Bart,"Sorry, Monty, but you're too big for this ride."
Bart,That's impossible! How did you get here first?
Bart,"There! Now you don't know which one is Little Monty! I guess if you don't want him to be part of your tuxedo, you'll have to let the other dogs go, too!"
Bart,"Well, at least it's safer than the old bus."
Bart,It's hard to see what's going on. I can only make out the fat soldiers.
Bart,"Ah, I think I got your lunch."
Bart,"Strike, eh?"
Bart,Oww! My bones are so brittle. But I always drink plenty of... malk?
Bart,I saw you two fighting. I'm worried there could be a strike and the school would shut down.
Bart,"Yeah, Skinner said you wouldn't have the wontons to go through with it."
Bart,"Well, I had to clean it up a little."
Bart,"But basically, Krabappel said you'd give the teachers everything they want."
Bart,Yeah. She said you'd fold faster than Superman on laundry day.
Bart,"Thank you, sir."
Bart,"Great news, Mom!"
Bart,The school's on strike. Maybe forever. Overload. Pleasure overload.
Bart,Awesome.
Bart,"You with the crane, spin around real fast."
Bart,"Now you, dump three tons of sand onto that port-a-potty."
Bart,Now for operation strike-make-go-longer.
Bart,"You know, I heard Skinner say the teachers will crack any minute."
Bart,"Milhouse, I found a hive of killer bees. You wanna go throw rocks at it?"
Bart,Huh?
Bart,Wuh?
Bart,Juh?
Bart,What do you mean the bank is out of money? Insolvent?! You only have enough cash for the next three customers?!
Bart,"Hello, mother dear."
Bart,In my weaker moments I almost pity them. Then I just remind myself they're trying to teach.
Bart,Mo-om.
Bart,May I?
Bart,Horrifying.
Bart,"Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test. Can I please go to the nurse?"
Bart,"Look Mom, it feels really weird having you on my turf. How would you feel if I started moppin' the floor?"
Bart,"Well, then. I guess I'll just have to get into the crawl space again."
Bart,Psst. Over here.
Bart,"Mom, I need a dollar. Ever since you started teaching here, kids have been taking my lunch money. And I need that money for candy."
Bart,Why isn't my mom stopping this?
Bart,"That's it. I can't take this anymore, Milhouse. I've gotta get the real teachers back."
Bart,"Zuh? Wait, that's it! With your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts, we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together."
Bart,...And you're not coming out until you reach an agreement.
Bart,"Don't worry, they'll start negotiating."
Bart,I'm listening...
Bart,"No thanks to you, Homer."
Bart,I'm surprised he doesn't try to blame his problems on his Percodan addiction.
Bart,"Oh you bet, Mom. Ask me anything."
Bart,"Um, the guy who chopped up George Washington?"
Bart,"Oh, my stomach!"
Bart,No I mean it. It really hurts!
Bart,"Mrs. Krabappel, I can't take the test. I have a stomach ache."
Bart,"Look, if you ignore me and I die, you'd get in a lot of trouble."
Bart,No teacher shall be held accountable if Bart Simpson dies.
Bart,Lunchlady Doris! Why are you here?
Bart,"Look, my stomach really hurts."
Bart,Wicked. I got this cool scar and I get to miss a week of school.
Bart,"Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks. I'm doing my rounds and uh, I'm a little behind."
Bart,"Hey, Lisa. Are you still upset about that jazz guy?"
Bart,"If it helps, I believe that after you die, you can come back as whatever you want. I'll be a butterfly."
Bart,Because nobody ever suspects the butterfly.
Bart,What kind of legal fees?
Bart,How much of the hundred thou do I get?
Bart,Five hundred dollars!
Bart,Cool!
Bart,I can't believe it! Five hundred bucks! Just think what I can do with that money!
Bart,Five hundred dollars on red.
Bart,Cool.
Bart,"Excuse me, my good man, I have five hundred dollars to blow. What have you got?"
Bart,I'll take it!
Bart,"Lisa, look what I've got!"
Bart,Ta-daa!
Bart,"When I said my stomach hurt, you were the only one who believed me."
Bart,Oh yeah? Take a look at this:
Bart,"Lisa, please, you're too puny to --"
Bart,"Yeah, like that really hurt."
Bart,"I borrowed your nail clipper, what's the big deal?"
Bart,Cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions?
Bart,"Wow, Mom, I never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before."
Bart,What if they shot at a coke machine?
Bart,TV?
Bart,TV with a picture of the mayor on it?
Bart,But Mom--
Bart,Ugh!
Bart,"Wet cement! Is there any sweeter sign? Well, maybe ""High Voltage."""
Bart,No time.
Bart,This is for the ages.
Bart,Ay caramba!
Bart,"Aah. Oh, good, somebody's shadow. I'll just turn and brag about my work."
Bart,It was an accident.
Bart,I think he'd be cool with it.
Bart,"Mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring Springfield."
Bart,"Wow, that does work."
Bart,"Hey, gonna win some this season?"
Bart,"Beautiful, aren't they?"
Bart,"Hey, Milhouse. How's the lemonade business?"
Bart,"You know Milhouse, I've been thinking. This town ain't so bad. Good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel sightings -- when you get right down to it, Springfield's a pretty cool place to live."
Bart,"Hey, stop talking bad about my town, man."
Bart,"I don't make trash, I burn it."
Bart,"Well, I know you are, but what am I?"
Bart,"Oh, I know you are, but what am I?"
Bart,"I know you are, but what am I?"
Bart,Takes one to know one.
Bart,That's a crud rock. It belongs in crud town.
Bart,Hey! They're taking our lemons!
Bart,Those Shelbyville kids think they're so hot. But you know what? They're not.
Bart,The lemon tree's gone!
Bart,We gotta get that tree back!
Bart,"That lemon tree's a part of our town, and as kids, the backbone of our economy. We'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead."
Bart,"Mom, you won't believe this, but something you said the other day really got through to me."
Bart,And now I am going to teach some kids a lesson.
Bart,Death to Shelbyville!
Bart,"Hey, Milhouse -- get your invasion supplies and let's go!"
Bart,"Okay, here's how it goes. I'm the leader. Milhouse is my loyal sidekick. Nelson is the tough guy, Martin's the smart guy and Todd's the quiet religious guy who ends up goin' crazy. And now, the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger. To step out of childhood and become men."
Bart,"If you get lost remember, you can always find east by staring directly at the sun."
Bart,They're gettin' rich off us!
Bart,"Good idea. Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team. Todd, you and Data are Team Strike Force. Nelson, that leaves you and Martin."
Bart,I'm not sure.
Bart,I assumed I could.
Bart,"Aw. It's no use, Milhouse. If we're gonna find that lemon tree, I've got to go undercover. What I need is a new face."
Bart,"Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians."
Bart,I don't go to school.
Bart,Five.
Bart,Curse those handsome devils.
Bart,"No, not in my mouth! Aye--is what the kid would say. To the bluffs!"
Bart,"That's right. The stranger who walks amongst you is me, Bart Simpson!"
Bart,"You know, Bart Simpson. From Springfield?"
Bart,"I'll use these spray cans as jet packs and fly to safety. So long, losers!"
Bart,"Uh... hey, look! Someone's attractive cousin."
Bart,"Uh oh, wet cement!"
Bart,I could sure use that flying motorcycle now.
Bart,Safe at last!
Bart,CAUTION: Exit through door seven only. All other rooms contain man-eating tigers.
Bart,Roman Numerals. They never even tried to teach us that in school.
Bart,Milhouse! What's seven in Roman Numerals?
Bart,Milhouse! Milhouse! Now what do I do?
Bart,Wait! I got it! I got it!
Bart,I don't got it.
Bart,"Okay. Think, Bart. Where have you seen Roman Numerals before? I know, ""Rocky Vee!"" That was the fifth one. So ""Rocky Five"" plus ""Rocky Two"" equals ""Rocky Seven: Adrian's Revenge!"""
Bart,"Oh, it's no use. I'm never gonna find that tree. This whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there. Wait a minute! There's a lemon behind that rock."
Bart,The tree!
Bart,"Keep your voices down, boys. We didn't come this far to get found out."
Bart,But they stole our lemon tree!
Bart,"There's got to be a way to get that tree back. Hey, look. A hospital! Pull in there."
Bart,I'll get the gate.
Bart,"Gun it, Flanders!"
Bart,We made it!
Bart,"Eat my shorts, Shelbyville!"
Bart,Eat my shorrrrrrrts!
Bart,Absolutely.
Bart,Yuck. What reeks?
Bart,"Big deal. They didn't approve my idea. They said it was ""unfeasible."""
Bart,"Well, um, yeah. I guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?"
Bart,Huh? Wahw!
Bart,"I'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy. I swear it."
Bart,"Burns needs some serious boosta-fazoo. Right, Dad? Dad? Homer?"
Bart,"That's my dog, man."
Bart,Wow!
Bart,Look what he did to my best friend!
Bart,"No, my dog!"
Bart,You twisted old monster!!
Bart,"Aren't we forgetting someone, Sister Suspect?"
Bart,Could so!
Bart,Could so!
Bart,Could so!
Bart,Could so!
Bart,Who wants chocolate ice cream?
Bart,"D.N.A., positive I.D. -- Those won't hold up in any court -- Run, Dad!"
Bart,"Aw, all these new superheroes suck. None of them can hold a candle to Radioactive Man."
Bart,"Nah, he's just a cheap imitation of Radioactive Man."
Bart,"The similarities are subtle, but many. For example, Radioactive Man has his famous catchphrase ""Up and Atom"" - with atom spelled a-t-o-m in a delicious pun..."
Bart,"... while Radiation Dude has a similar, but lamer catchphrase: ""Up and Let's Go."""
Bart,"Well, between us we've read all 814 issues of Radioactive Man."
Bart,Who's gonna play Radioactive Man?
Bart,"Look behind you, Radioactive Man! The sun is exploding again!"
Bart,"I'm practicing my Fallout Boy dialogue. If I get this role, I could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called Bart."
Bart,Watch out!
Bart,...Radioactive Man!!!
Bart,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's all in the delivery. ...Now is the winter of our discontent..."
Bart,"Watch out, Radioactive Man!!!!!"
Bart,"Watch out, Radioactive Man!!!!!"
Bart,"Watch out, Radioactive Man!!!!!"
Bart,"I've got to grow an inch by tomorrow or I won't get that part. Pull, you mighty stallions, pull. Show me no mercy."
Bart,I only grew half an inch. I'm still too short.
Bart,Is there anyway I can look taller without actually being taller?
Bart,"Good news, gentlemen. I've grown that extra inch you wanted, plus several feet more."
Bart,"Hey, you're not Milhouse."
Bart,I just missed out on the greatest opportunity of my entire life. George Burns was right -- show business is a hideous bitch goddess.
Bart,"You're right, Lis. I can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to God."
Bart,"Hi, Milhouse. Hey, I want you to know that I'm glad at least one of us got the part."
Bart,Milhouse!
Bart,I didn't do it! I wished him well! I wished him weeelll!
Bart,There's the real Milhouse.
Bart,Milhouse!
Bart,"Hey, cool, Milhouse! You get to be crushed by a truck!"
Bart,"Wow. You really got it made now, Milhouse. This is living."
Bart,Yes.
Bart,Yeah. Ahhh!
Bart,I know Milhouse. I'll just check all his old haunts.
Bart,Have you seen Milhouse?
Bart,"Yo, Doctor S. Have you seen Milhouse?"
Bart,"Okay, thanks."
Bart,I will.
Bart,The only place left is the treehouse.
Bart,Ah-ha!
Bart,"But Milhouse, being a star is every patriotic American's dream."
Bart,Television.
Bart,"But Milhouse! They haven't cured anything. Heart disease and world hunger are still rampant. Those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers. Every last one of them. Want results? You have to go to the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones, and, to a lesser extent, the Van Dammes."
Bart,"Wow, spanning two decades."
Bart,"So, Milhouse, it must be a little tough givin' up all that glamour comin' back to school, huh."
Bart,G'mornin'.
Bart,But they told us to wear 'em.
Bart,"Hey, how come I get lice and nothing happens to Milhouse?"
Bart,"Uh, please don't hug me. It sickens me."
Bart,"Here you go, Todd. The city edition."
Bart,I hate this place.
Bart,Watch Itchy and Scratchy!
Bart,I never heard Maggie laugh like that before.
Bart,"When she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her."
Bart,I know. They put honey on their pancakes instead of maple syrup.
Bart,But it's only 7 o'clock.
Bart,Remember how Mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days?
Bart,Jesus?
Bart,Ha ha. You're gonna be Lisa Flanders.
Bart,That's because she can't talk.
Bart,"Wow, Dad, you took a baptismal for me. How do you feel?"
Bart,Like I don't have a soul?
Bart,"There was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage, though."
Bart,Hymns here! I got hymns here! Get 'em while they're holy! Fresh from God's brain to your mouth!
Bart,...where my soul will be chopped into confetti and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers...
Bart,Milhouse!
Bart,You shank. How could you tell on me?
Bart,"Soul? Come on, Milhouse. There's no such thing as a soul. It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogeyman or Michael Jackson."
Bart,"Well, if your soul's real, where is it?"
Bart,Uh huh. What if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean?
Bart,"How can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid? Listen. You don't have a soul, I don't have a soul, there's no such thing as a soul."
Bart,How much you got?
Bart,Deal.
Bart,There you go: one soul.
Bart,"Any time, chummmmm...p."
Bart,"Oh, Li-sa. There's a little present for you lying in the driveway."
Bart,I wasted five bucks on these.
Bart,I sold my soul to Milhouse.
Bart,You believe in that junk?
Bart,"Poor gullible Lisa. I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks."
Bart,"Well, if you think he got such a good deal, I'll sell you my conscience for four-fifty."
Bart,"I'll throw in my sense of decency, too. It's a Bart sales event! Everything about me must go!"
Bart,"Hey, boy. How ya doin'?"
Bart,"Man, what's gotten into you?"
Bart,Geez. You're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day.
Bart,Stupid automatic door.
Bart,Let me try.
Bart,This is getting weird.
Bart,"I know that's funny, but I'm just not laughing."
Bart,I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda.
Bart,Nope. I don't feel a thing.
Bart,Nothing.
Bart,"Bet you're getting tired of that soul, huh?"
Bart,Suppose someone wanted to buy it from you?
Bart,What?!
Bart,"Mom, I need to tell you something. I kinda--"
Bart,Wait! Wait for me!
Bart,I can't take this anymore. I want my soul and I want it now!
Bart,Milhouse! Milhouse! You win! I want this nightmare to end!
Bart,Where's Milhouse?
Bart,"When Milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a piece of paper?"
Bart,"Okay, okay. Milhouse's Grandmother lives on 257th Street, and I'm on Third."
Bart,"Well, finally, a little luck."
Bart,"Hello, Ralph."
Bart,"Yes. A simple proposition, Ralph: How would you like to make a dollar?"
Bart,"All you have to do is sign a paper that says I can have your soul. I need a soul, Ralph. Any soul. Yours."
Bart,"Milhouse, please."
Bart,"Milhouse, I gotta have my soul back. I'll do anything you want."
Bart,You traded my soul for POGS?! Noooo!!
Bart,Please. You have something of mine on a little piece of paper.
Bart,Who?
Bart,"Are you there, God? It's me, Bart Simpson. I know I never paid too much attention in church, but I could really use some of that good stuff now. I'm afraid. I'm afraid some weirdo's got my soul and I don't know what they're doing to it. I just want it back. Please. I hope you can hear this..."
Bart,Lisa! You bought this?
Bart,There's no change in your piggy bank.
Bart,"Oh Lis, thank you."
Bart,Uh huh.
Bart,What a load of crappy-crap-crap.
Bart,He blows all right. He blows big time.
Bart,"So long, suck--"
Bart,This one spent two hours in the broiler.
Bart,"I think Lisa's right, dad. Eating meat is ba-a-a-ad."
Bart,"Hey, that's my chop!"
Bart,"Say what? Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa. They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. Stuff like that."
Bart,What's that extra b for?
Bart,YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...
Bart,YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...
Bart,"Can I have a burger, dad?"
Bart,What?
Bart,It's gone.
Bart,"Give it up, dad. Piggy ain't comin' back."
Bart,"You dunkin' your sausages in that syrup, homeboy?"
Bart,"Uh, Dad, Lisa's the one you're not talking to."
Bart,What are you waitin' for? Wreck the school. You know you wanna.
Bart,I agree. Destroy the school.
Bart,"Well, except for Chubsy-Ubsy over there."
Bart,Okay boy. Catch the Frisbee.
Bart,"Good catch, boy."
Bart,It was only a dream.
Bart,Yes.
Bart,"...And then he raked me across the chest. And the weirdest thing was, it was that school janitor who mysteriously disappeared -- Groundskeeper Willie."
Bart,"Um... We didn't mention Groundskeeper Willie, Mom."
Bart,"You're right. The only thing left to do is to go into my dream and force Willie into a final showdown. You stay awake, and if it looks like I'm in trouble, wake me up."
Bart,"Come on, Willie. I know you're out there."
Bart,The sandbox!
Bart,Hey Lawn-Boy! You missed a spot!
Bart,Willie's gone for good. Now I can get back to my normal dreams: me and Krusty winning the Superbowl.
Bart,"Help! Lisa, help!"
Bart,"Wait a minute... If you're here, then you've fallen asleep too!"
Bart,Good-bye Lis. I hope you get reincarnated as someone who can stay awake for fifteen minutes.
Bart,"Nuh-uh, 'cause we called it."
Bart,'Fraid so.
Bart,"Uh, may I take your coat, Aunt Selma?"
Bart,No.
Bart,That does it. I'm going in.
Bart,"Cool, man!"
Bart,"I'll save you, Dad."
Bart,"Oh, I can't get any closer! You'll have to jump!"
Bart,"Well, we hit a little snag when the universe sorta collapsed on itself... but dad seemed cautiously optimistic."
Bart,"If you gain 61 pounds, they'll let you work at home?"
Bart,"Dad, I know we don't do a lot together, but helping you gain 61 pounds is something I want to be a part of."
Bart,"Hi, Doctor Nick!"
Bart,You could brush your teeth with milkshakes!
Bart,"Eat around the banana, Dad, it's just empty vitamins."
Bart,"Homer, you're... um... on the towel rack."
Bart,"Hey, Lis, come look at this."
Bart,"Bad news, Dad, we're out of food. We're even out of the basic elements of food. You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce."
Bart,"Dad? It says ""Non-Toxic."""
Bart,"Ah, Dad? Towel rack...?"
Bart,"Not me, sister. When I grow up I wanna be a lardo on workman's comp, just like Dad."
Bart,I wash myself with a rag on a stick.
Bart,He's a Nuclear Safety Technician.
Bart,What isn't he doing?
Bart,"Hey, Homer, you promised Mom you wouldn't wear your dress outside."
Bart,And I think it's ironic that for once Dad's butt prevented the release of toxic ga--
Bart,"That dummy worked like a charm, Dad."
Bart,Whuth va hell ith going on heah?!
Bart,"Where have you been, Granny? Did they freeze you or something?"
Bart,"Hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life, you owe me years of back presents: Christmases, birthdays, Easters, Kwaanzas, good report cards...at seventy-five bucks a pop, plus interest and penalties... You owe me twenty-two thousand dollars."
Bart,What?
Bart,What?
Bart,"Yeah, I don't trust her either. When I was going through her purse, look what I found."
Bart,"Spill it, Muddy Mae, or we're calling the cops!"
Bart,"Quick Gramma, hide!"
Bart,"Look at me, Gramma, I'm a hippie! Peace, man! Groovy! Bomb VIetnam! Four more years! Up with people!"
Bart,"Oh, just think, Lis, that's our pickle brine burning Sideshow Mel."
Bart,And he tried to murder me.
Bart,I wanna see some birds get sucked into the engines! Rare ones!
Bart,"Way to guard the parking lot, Top Gun."
Bart,Look at that hunk o' junk.
Bart,So how do you know so much about American history?
Bart,No!
Bart,Sideshow Bob!
Bart,Cool! I want to be around when those guns start going off!
Bart,Target sighted. Launching air-to-nerd missile!
Bart,"Free 'n' easy, Lis. Ahh. There's nothing like an unfurnished basement for pure comfort."
Bart,"Tight, binding underwear?"
Bart,"Bob, no!!"
Bart,So Krusty double-crossed you. But your basic plan was pure genius. Where do you get your ideas?
Bart,I should've known you were too smart to fall for that.
Bart,Daaadd! Hellllp!
Bart,"Are you getting a lot of bugs in your mouth, too?"
Bart,I'm comin'!
Bart,"You can't escape, Bob! If the tennis rackets don't get you, the pool skimmers will."
Bart,"But you can't kill Krusty. He made you what you are. Without him, you wouldn't even be called Sideshow."
Bart,"Get out of the way, Krusty!"
Bart,Mo-om! You're embarrassing me in front of the Army guys.
Bart,"Um, Dad..."
Bart,"What is the mind? Is it just a system of impulses, or is it something tangible?"
Bart,"Thanks, Dad."
Bart,Aha! No one's around. The perfect crime.
Bart,Yeow!
Bart,There's no perfect crime.
Bart,I've got a great idea. Let's play Space Patrol.
Bart,"Maggie can be Maggina, her spunky sidekick."
Bart,Gotta hide.
Bart,Oops.
Bart,Ahhhh. Welcome to ze exotic world of undersea explorer Bart Simpson.
Bart,"Come with Bart as he dive into the briny deep, searching for the wily and elusive wash cloth. Suddenly, without warning, the great Bart get more than he bargain for."
Bart,Help! Help!
Bart,"Clean as a whistle, Homer!"
Bart,Oh. A soiled wig.
Bart,I'd sell my soul for a Formula One racing car!
Bart,Changed my mind. Sorry. Cool!
Bart,This movie you rented sucks.
Bart,"No, let me try the cup and ball."
Bart,I wanna stay here with Mr. Burns.
Bart,Whoa!!
Bart,"Oh, yeah."
Bart,Buy me BoneStorm or go to hell!!
Bart,It's the coolest video game ever!
Bart,"Those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result in me getting the game."
Bart,"Oh, I'll never get that game."
Bart,"Mo-om, I'm not a little kid anymore. Tuck-in Time is lame."
Bart,"Mom, it's lame to be proud of being lame."
Bart,"Mom! No, Mom!"
Bart,I want to buy a copy of BoneStorm. Here's ninety-nine cents.
Bart,"Then may I please rent it, please?"
Bart,Milhouse has BoneStorm!
Bart,"Say, Cool Dude, can I play, too?"
Bart,"Then how come it says ""2nd Player Score""?!"
Bart,"Hmmm. Maybe if I stand next to the games looking sad, someone will feel sorry for me and buy me one."
Bart,That must be the happiest kid in the world.
Bart,Are you guys shoplifting?
Bart,I'm outside. I got away with it! I'm free!
Bart,Uh... I don't think this is the kind of coat that opens.
Bart,E-excuse me?
Bart,No.
Bart,I-I-I could pay for the game. I'll pay for it.
Bart,"Um, okay, I've really really really learned my lesson. Can I please go now?"
Bart,"Everything except ""capiche""..."
Bart,"Gotta change that answering machine tape! Oh God, I gotta change that tape!"
Bart,Now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it.
Bart,What for?
Bart,"Well, you lucked out, Marge my man, 'cause I'm in a smiling mood today."
Bart,Try-N-Save?!
Bart,"Come on, new bike!"
Bart,I don't have to listen to these wild allegations.
Bart,"So we're just going to do this photo and get out, right? Ba-da-bing ba-da-boom?"
Bart,The store detective!
Bart,"Hey Assel Adams, let's go! Take the photo!"
Bart,"Well, c'mon! Hurry up!"
Bart,"Wait! Mom, I don't want you to see this."
Bart,I did it.
Bart,"Mom, I'm really sorry."
Bart,Is there anything I can do?
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Man, I thought Mom was gonna scream me stupid. She didn't even raise her voice."
Bart,Really? You think this might be one of those forever-type things?
Bart,"Oh great, the tuck-in express in right on time."
Bart,"Hey, Mom. You didn't wake me up."
Bart,You didn't put my marshmallow in.
Bart,Okay. I can handle that.
Bart,"Milhouse, do you ever worry that your mom might stop loving you?"
Bart,"Yeah, that was pretty good."
Bart,"Hey, how come you're not playing BoneStorm?"
Bart,"Yeah, right. You're just trying to trick me because you don't want me playing with your videogame."
Bart,"C'mon, don't be a cup and ball hog!"
Bart,"Okay, okay, I won't bug Milhouse... But... Well, Mrs. Van Houten, this is gonna sound kinda dumb, but can I hang out with you while you do mom stuff?"
Bart,Who are Dan and Sherry Adler?
Bart,Oh. And who is Warren Burke?
Bart,Really.
Bart,Tell me I'm good.
Bart,"Hey, that's Mom! She's happy again!"
Bart,You guys made a snowman family?
Bart,Why didn't you wait for me?
Bart,Stupid family...
Bart,Huh.
Bart,"Everybody thinks I'm the black sheep. Well, I'll show them what a black sheep can do."
Bart,Nothing.
Bart,I told you I don't have anything.
Bart,I wanted to surprise you for Christmas...
Bart,Mo-ommm...
Bart,You got me...?
Bart,"Uh, yeahhh! Thanks, Mom."
Bart,"Omigod! The ""Mad Magazine Special Edition""! They only put out seventeen of these a year!"
Bart,Let's do the fold-in.
Bart,I'll say God.
Bart,Does something smell funny in here?
Bart,"Look at this! Special insert -- ""Iron-On Mad-ness!"" ""BAN THE BATH,"" ""DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER TEN,"" ""SOCK IT TO ME""..."
Bart,"Oh man, is it hot in here! I better take off my sweater."
Bart,How do you know it's from Mad?
Bart,"... Ah, my punishment?"
Bart,"Mom, my sling shot doesn't fit in these pockets. And these shorts leave nothing to the imagination. These uniforms suck!"
Bart,They made us!
Bart,"Oh! There's something I used to do in this situation, but... can't... remember..."
Bart,"Wow, look at all the colors, man!"
Bart,"Well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?"
Bart,"Dad, it's right across the street from us!"
Bart,That fancy house'll never sell. Nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood.
Bart,"Who are you talking to, Homer?"
Bart,"Wow, a former president, living right across the street!"
Bart,"Helloooo, Mr. Bush!"
Bart,"Hi!... Hey, what's this?"
Bart,"Who's that, George?"
Bart,"Who's that, George?"
Bart,"That's a dumb name. Who's that, George?"
Bart,"How many times were you president, George?"
Bart,"Did your Secret Service goons ever whack anybody, George?"
Bart,"Yeah, well, welcome to the twentieth century, George."
Bart,"Why hello, Mrs. Bush."
Bart,"You know, your husband's awful grumpy."
Bart,Where'd you get those pajamas?
Bart,Yes I am.
Bart,"Hey, where's your candy?"
Bart,"Helloooo, Mr. Bush!"
Bart,Whatcha doing?
Bart,"Hey, cool, what does this do?"
Bart,"Whoa, man."
Bart,"I begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the nation."
Bart,"If you get one up his butt, it's a million points."
Bart,Looks like we're experiencing some blow-back from the wig offensive.
Bart,His house?
Bart,Locusts. They'll drive him nuts.
Bart,"Yay, Dad!"
Bart,"Get him, boys!!"
Bart,Let's go to the Sharper Image. They've got a TV shaped like a Fifties diner!
Bart,"Don't be a sap, Dad. These are just crappy knock-offs."
Bart,"Aww, raspberries."
Bart,Wow. Livin' large!
Bart,"That place is weird. A man in the bathroom kept handing me towels, 'til I paid him to stop."
Bart,"Mom, you are lookin' fab-u-lous."
Bart,I'm gonna pose as an Italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money.
Bart,"I'm sorry, Mom. I'll behave."
Bart,Sort of.
Bart,There's a special on tacos down at the The TacoMat. A hundred tacos for a hundred dollars. I'm gonna get that.
Bart,"Boy, I sure could go for a hundred tacos right about now."
Bart,"Really?! Wow, I should've started a long time ago!"
Bart,I got the account where you get free customized checks. I chose the Hindenberg flip-book series.
Bart,Coooool.
Bart,"No, Mom, I can handle it. Let's see... Pay to the order of... Lisa. One cent... and no cents. And now the old John Hancock... Here you go."
Bart,"Uh, that's a post-dated check, remember. Don't cash it 'til the year ten thousand."
Bart,No need. I'm going to get Krusty's autograph the easy way.
Bart,"If he wants these 25 cents, he'll have to endorse the check by signing it on the back. Then when my monthly bank statement comes, I'll get the check back complete with autograph. No fuss, no muss."
Bart,"Lisa's autograph... Apu's autograph... Oh, whaddaya know, Jimbo's real name is Corky... Aannnnd Krusty... Hey! ""Cayman Islands Offshore Holding Corporation""?"
Bart,Krusty was supposed to sign this. Take it back and make him sign it.
Bart,Krusty's my hero! How could I do this to him?
Bart,"Yeah, there'll be enough people to do that for me at recess tomorrow."
Bart,Krusty? Hi. Is it okay if I sit down here?
Bart,"I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you, Krusty. But, you know, my mom says God never closes a door without opening a window."
Bart,"It doesn't matter how you live or what you did wrong. As long as you're on TV, people will respect you."
Bart,"Well, if it'll make you feel any better, Krusty, you can punch me in the face."
Bart,"Aw, that's my Krusty. I got a feeling he'll be allll-right."
Bart,I can't believe Krusty is really gone.
Bart,Yes. Yes it would.
Bart,Krusty!
Bart,Mom! I just saw Krusty!
Bart,"No, on the street."
Bart,Why won't you believe me?!
Bart,"Krusty?! Doctor Hibbert, who was that man?"
Bart,Am I going crazy? I'm seeing Krusty everywhere.
Bart,"Wait a minute! All those things I saw -- there's a connection! The truck full of nets and buckets, the queasy guy, the lobsters... they all point to one thing. Follow me."
Bart,Ahoy! Have you seen this man?
Bart,"Lisa! Look! A signature with stars around it, just like Krusty's!"
Bart,Are you Rory B. Bellows?
Bart,How about Krusty the Clown?
Bart,"Well, if you're not Krusty, how come you have the exact same signature as him?"
Bart,And Krusty's superfluous third nipple!
Bart,"So now that we've blown your cover, I guess you've gotta come back and do your show again!"
Bart,"But Krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you to brighten up their afternoons? Are you going to turn your back on them?"
Bart,"C'mon, Lis, Krusty doesn't want our attention anymore. Let's go worship somebody who has the guts to be a celebrity."
Bart,"Krusty's tired of having phonies around, pretending to be his friends. I'm sure he'll find plenty of people who'll like him for who he is."
Bart,"What about: being an illiterate TV clown who's still more respected than all the scientists, doctors and educators in the country put together?"
Bart,"So Krusty, what are you gonna do about your tax problem?"
Bart,"I hope they show the time where they traded guns to the Indians for corn, and then the Indians shot them and took the corn."
Bart,"Yeah, Dad! You're a big fat loudmouth. And you can walk when you have to."
Bart,Yes.
Bart,"""I want to help you, George Washington?"" Even your dreams are square."
Bart,"You missed the race, mama."
Bart,"Look alive, Simpson! I'm not paying you to goldbrick!"
Bart,"Now get cracking on my long division. And don't forget to show your work, Simpson."
Bart,"Quick, Mom! Whip up a cake before Dad fires you!"
Bart,What did you get that for?
Bart,Makes sense to me.
Bart,"Lisa, if I ever stop loving violence, I want you to shoot me."
Bart,Downtown.
Bart,Save our seats!
Bart,How come I've never seen that Itchy and Scratchy before?
Bart,Cool. I'll give you ten bucks for that.
Bart,"It's valuable, huh?"
Bart,Loser.
Bart,The mouse.
Bart,"Oh, forget this. I'm outta here."
Bart,"Hey, wait up!"
Bart,"Show some respect, man! That ""no talent"" created Itchy and Scratchy."
Bart,Huh?
Bart,"You invented Itchy? The ""Itchy and Scratchy"" Itchy?"
Bart,"Well, I'm not calling you a liar, but... but I can't think of a way to finish that sentence."
Bart,Itchy The Lucky Mouse In: Manhattan Madness.
Bart,Itchy Runs Afoul Of An Irishman.
Bart,Look at that fat oaf.
Bart,I can't believe it. That was Itchy all right. You did invent him! When people see this you'll be rich and famous!
Bart,You can't just go back to the gutter! You created Itchy. You should be a millionaire!
Bart,"You asked Roger Myers, Sr. for money. Roger Myers, Jr. is in charge of the studio now. He's a good man. Every Christmas, he goes down to the pound and rescues one cat and one mouse and gives them to a hungry family."
Bart,"Hmm. Well, you can stay at my house until then. My parents won't mind, because they won't even know about it."
Bart,"All right, the coast is clear."
Bart,There's a box you can sleep in.
Bart,Just move that cot out of the way.
Bart,Do you know what Radon is?
Bart,Goodnight.
Bart,"He's not a regular bum, Mom. He's a genius bum. He created Itchy. And he's the father of cartoon violence."
Bart,He just needs to stay here till tomorrow. We're going down to Itchy and Scratchy Studios to pick up his check.
Bart,"$1,000! But your ad says ""No Money Down!"""
Bart,"So, you don't work on a contingency basis?"
Bart,"Hey Dad, can I have $1,000?"
Bart,To pay for a lawyer for my bum.
Bart,Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. There's an easy way to get rid of Chester without the guilt of sending him back to the gutter.
Bart,"And all it will cost you is $1,000."
Bart,"I've got it! Dad, give me $750!"
Bart,Keep the trial going. I'll be right back.
Bart,"I knew I had seen this exact scene somewhere else -- it was in the movie Mr. Lampwick showed me. Ladies and gentlemen, this drawing was made in 1919, nine years before Roger Myers made his first Itchy and Scratchy cartoon."
Bart,Careful... Careful...
Bart,It's there!
Bart,We killed Itchy and Scratchy?
Bart,What the hell is this?
Bart,We need another Vietnam to thin out their ranks a little...
Bart,Ow! We gotta get Itchy and Scratchy back.
Bart,Ow!
Bart,You've got to make more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons.
Bart,"Look, if money's the only problem, I know a guy who has lots of it."
Bart,"Hi, Chester. Listen, would you pay to make more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons?"
Bart,"Dad, can we have $183,000?"
Bart,Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
Bart,"Yeah, I agree. You wanna start on trying to get Apu out of jail?"
Bart,Well... I wasn't the one who solved the problem and neither was Lisa. There's something unsettling about that.
Bart,What a perfect plan. Now Roger Myers' hotel is just around the--
Bart,What the hell is going on?
Bart,I never even heard about that.
Bart,"I guess you don't need it now, but we had a plan too."
Bart,Why did they make that one muppet out of leather?
Bart,This play has everything!
Bart,Go to Work with Your Parents Day?
Bart,"Because I've always been an advocate of women in the workplace, Lis."
Bart,I can't help it if Mom's workplace contains our TV.
Bart,"Mom, you're blocking the TV. If you need something to do, you can fill out my form. Here."
Bart,"Well, at least I'm not stuck at the cracker factory like Milhouse."
Bart,"Yes. You are right, Milhouse. It is a fake. Which makes it a fake I.D."
Bart,And it's our ticket to the best Spring Break of our lives!
Bart,"One adult and two children, please."
Bart,"Are you kidding? I take it as a compliment! Three beers, please!"
Bart,Maybe when we find something decent to do with this I.D.
Bart,"Well, we're having the best Spring Break of our lives, and we don't need you around nerding it up."
Bart,"Oh yeah, right. Like there's any way to get some kicks with a big wad of cash and a license to drive..."
Bart,"Gentlemen, for our road trip, I have taken the liberty of preparing an airtight and utterly plausible alibi for use on our parents..."
Bart,"Maybe because you are, as we say in Latin, a Dorkus Malorkus."
Bart,He sure did.
Bart,"Cruise control, my good man. Everybody all set back here? Nelson, good to see you! Martin, always a pleasure..."
Bart,"We're not going to a Grammar Rodeo! That was just an alibi, Milton!!"
Bart,Martin.
Bart,Keep reading...
Bart,What's inside?
Bart,So it's a choice between Disneyworld and Knoxville.
Bart,I concur.
Bart,I don't see why not.
Bart,Yes.
Bart,"Branson, Missouri. My dad says it's like Vegas if it were run by Ned Flanders."
Bart,"Uh, we don't need to stop here."
Bart,We're on the home stretch!
Bart,"Hurry up! We've only got four days to spend at the... ""Wod Fir?"""
Bart,"Uh, excuse me... Is this the World's Fair Visitors Center?"
Bart,What about the Sunsphere?
Bart,"Well, we've still got a car and a wad of cash."
Bart,We've got no car!
Bart,"No!! They'd kill us! Look, we got here on our own, so we can survive here on our own. All we need is money, food, and a way to get home. Follow me."
Bart,Everybody remember: we're parked under the Sunsphere.
Bart,Come on! This train goes right through Springfield!
Bart,"Lisa, I really need your help, so I'm gonna let you in on a secret. There's no such thing."
Bart,I'm in trouble already. Here's what happened...So you've got to think of a way I can come home for free.
Bart,"Milhouse, d'you ever think about the people in those cars?"
Bart,"Lisa? This isn't working. I've got to courier something to Springfield. And it's gotta be big enough to fit Milhouse, Martin, and Nelson inside."
Bart,"Oh, I can't take much more of this. I'm counting on you, Lis."
Bart,Ssshh! They'll know you're in there!
Bart,...but I don't think I'd go back again next year. It's getting too commercial. They've forgotten it's supposed to be about the grammar.
Bart,"Sometimes I wonder about all the people in this town. Do you think anything interesting ever happens to them? I mean, there must be thousands of great stories out there."
Bart,"What do you think, Milhouse? Milhouse?"
Bart,"Forget it. C'mon, it's 11 o'clock. I need some sugar."
Bart,"Well, Milhouse, I guess interesting stuff does happen to people in Springfield."
Bart,There's just not enough time to hear 'em all...
Bart,"Grampa! I don't mind when you spit at home, but I have to work with these people."
Bart,"Grampa, hush."
Bart,"Here, why don't you spit some more."
Bart,"Oh, please, no."
Bart,...And then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other. Why is he always making up those crazy stories?
Bart,Maybe it's time to put him in one where he can't get out.
Bart,"Well, I'm sure you'll make up something. Maybe you just need more of my classmates around."
Bart,Dumpster.
Bart,"Look, if you're going to stay in my room, could you at least stop making up gibberish?"
Bart,Wrinkly gibberish?
Bart,"Mmm-hmm. You bossed around the richest, most powerful guy in town. How come you were a sergeant and he was only a private?"
Bart,"Well, if you saved Burns' life, why does he want to kill you?"
Bart,"Great story, Grampa. Coulda used a vampire, though. 'Night."
Bart,"Oh wow! There really is a treasure! Whatever you do, don't give him the key, Grampa!"
Bart,"Figures... Hey, Mr. Burns!"
Bart,Can I go with you to get the treasure? I won't eat much and I don't know the difference between right and wrong.
Bart,"Not without the keys, he isn't."
Bart,Now we can get the treasure!
Bart,"I can't believe you, Grampa. The sergeant in that story you told would never be scared of a dork like Burns! You gotta get that treasure! You gotta do it for Ox and Asa and Griff and Burnsie... Well, not so much Burnsie."
Bart,"Uh, yes. But we gotta act fast!"
Bart,On a treasure hunt.
Bart,"Hey, Grampa, do you think your dead buddies get up and walk around at night?"
Bart,"Gotcha. Hey, Grampa, do you think I could've been a Flying Hellfish?"
Bart,Wo-o-o-ow!
Bart,Huh. The light must've burned out.
Bart,"You coward! You're an embarrassment to the name ""Hellfish!"""
Bart,"I'm sorry I cost you your fortune, Grampa."
Bart,"Consarn it, he's getting away!"
Bart,"You're rich, Grampa! You did it! And Burns can never take that away from you!"
Bart,"You never were, Grampa."
Bart,I won't get embarrassed. I don't care who knows I love my Grampa.
Bart,"I've got ya, dad!"
Bart,"There's no denying it, Sis."
Bart,"Hey, what's this one for?"
Bart,"Hey, Apu, why don't just marry some American broad, then dump her after you get your citizenship?"
Bart,"Didja hear that, Mom? She's as dumb as me!"
Bart,"Hey, whatcha doin -- studyin'?"
Bart,Dad?
Bart,Dad?
Bart,"Dad, please. You're embarrassing us."
Bart,"Dad! No one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!"
Bart,"Homer, first of all it's ""par-tay."" And second, we wouldn't par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth."
Bart,"Dear Lord, if you keep Homer from embarrassing us today, we promise to build several churches in your honor."
Bart,Check the authenticator spot.
Bart,What is that smell?
Bart,"Dad, you cannot wear that! That's a rastafarian hat!"
Bart,"You know what, Dad? Maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while."
Bart,"Aw, making teenagers depressed is like shootin' fish in a barrel."
Bart,Dear Bart and Lisa...
Bart,"So what's it like being famous, Dad?"
Bart,"Dad, do you wear boxers or briefs?"
Bart,What religion are you?
Bart,"Just some report I gotta do for school. Hey, you want some pie?"
Bart,Mo-om!
Bart,You're the coolest dad alive!
Bart,"Dad, what you just said was powerfully un-cool."
Bart,"Well, sure you do."
Bart,"It's the last day of school, Milhouse. Try to show some dignity."
Bart,"Hi, Becky. Thanks for comin' out."
Bart,Your daughter is named Seymour?
Bart,"Mom, I'm gonna tighten Milhouse's straps. He's fidgeting again."
Bart,Bye-bye toothbrush.
Bart,When the hell are we gonna get to... where the hell are we going?
Bart,I thought Springfield was America's scrod-basket.
Bart,"Nice try, Todd."
Bart,Last one in is a yearbook editor!
Bart,"Lisa? With people? If they're impressed by her, I'm gonna Bart their world. Okay, Milhouse, you know the drill."
Bart,Hot stuff comin' through!
Bart,My friendship. You know you want it.
Bart,No. They must have seen you.
Bart,"Oh, why do we have to play this lousy old game?"
Bart,How come Lisa doesn't have to play? Why does she get to hang out with her friends?
Bart,"Check this out: ""Miss Perfect Attendance""."
Bart,Fresh out.
Bart,"Oh, this is the worst Fourth of July ever. I hate America! Come on, Milhouse, let's go down there."
Bart,"They're my friends, rightfully. She only got them by copying me!"
Bart,See?! That's my expression!
Bart,It's the principle. She's gotta learn!
Bart,So Lisa has a friend. We'll see about that.
Bart,"Hey, you guys! You wanna see how cool Lisa Simpson really is?"
Bart,Grammar Rodeo -- Head Buccaroo.
Bart,The French Table -- ooh la la.
Bart,"Hey, Lis."
Bart,"I guess my little yearbook stunt was pretty rough, but it did teach you a lesson: It's important to be yourself."
Bart,"Hey, Lisa, make friends with this!"
Bart,"Lisa, wait!"
Bart,I guess I should give this back to you.
Bart,I showed it to your friends again before we left.
Bart,Look inside.
Bart,Maybe it was just the cat.
Bart,Did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last night?
Bart,The unsold copies of Dad's autobiography.
Bart,I don't care. I can't breathe in here.
Bart,Who or what is Hugo?
Bart,"You expect me to believe all this? If any of it was true, wouldn't I have a big, hideous scar..."
Bart,"You're here, aren't you?"
Bart,W-w-what do you want from me?
Bart,You're crazy!
Bart,But you'll kill both of us!
Bart,"Oh, don't look so shocked."
Bart,"Hey, can I have some turkey?"
Bart,"Hey, Dad."
Bart,"Hey, Lis. Check out my science project."
Bart,That nerds conduct electricity.
Bart,"Hey, what is this goo? Are you trying to grow a friend?"
Bart,"Hey, you built a model city. Is that the school?"
Bart,"Oops, my fingers slipped. Oops, my fingers slipped. Oops, my fingers slipped."
Bart,What the heck? Gah!
Bart,Your micro-jerks attacked me!
Bart,"You can't protect them every second. Sooner or later you'll let your guard down, and then -- flush! It's toilet time for tiny town."
Bart,"Sure you were, rummy."
Bart,Me neither!
Bart,"No it hasn't, Dad. That's why we're leaving."
Bart,"Ah, 'little help here?"
Bart,I call this room!
Bart,Um... Uh...
Bart,"Two, wintim amd Jawwy wirt..."
Bart,"Um, well, I know hell and damn and bi--"
Bart,I know of them.
Bart,"So, what are you in for?"
Bart,"Let me get this straight. We're behind the rest of our class, and we're going to catch up to them by going slower than they are?"
Bart,"Look, lady, I'm s'posed to be in the fourth grade."
Bart,"Sports collectibles! Wow, a baseball made out of Secretariat!"
Bart,Why don't you buy it?
Bart,I can't get in trouble at school. They put me in the remedial class! I'm surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round!
Bart,Hey Dad...
Bart,We want to go back to Springfield.
Bart,"Oh, this sucks!"
Bart,"Hey, Lis, check out this space age toothbrush."
Bart,I'll give you four bucks for it!
Bart,"This isn't a belt, it's a Tactical Pants-Retaining System. Check it out: compass, matches, whistle, saw, panic button, squirrel snare, radon-slash-lie detector, sphygmomanometer... and it's even got turn signals!"
Bart,"Well, not really... 'cause yours is just a piece of extension cord..."
Bart,Time for a little evasive action...
Bart,"I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but you guys asked for it..."
Bart,Can't you read? Call the police!
Bart,Some bullies beat me up and took it.
Bart,But then they'll just beat me up even worse.
Bart,"Way to go, Dad! Take those punches!"
Bart,"You'll be okay, Dad. Just make sure he hits you an even number of times so you don't end up with amnesia."
Bart,Wow! I've never seen Dad hit somebody like that before!
Bart,Isn't Dad the one in the black trunks?
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"I got your tooth, Dad!"
Bart,"That's a hitchhiker, Homer."
Bart,"Yeah, sure, we know him. That's Mr. Burns."
Bart,He's great at pointing out everyone's foibles!
Bart,"He's kidding, Mom. But seriously, I'd love to have hair like yours -- I just can't get the zoning permits."
Bart,More food.
Bart,I hate Pai Gow. Can't we just play Quang Jong?
Bart,"No, Dad! Shoot your way out!"
Bart,Woo hoo!
Bart,What time?
Bart,Shall we say ten?
Bart,"Dad, do I have to brush my teeth?"
Bart,Huh -- garbage angels?
Bart,"Dad, I think I need some fresh air. Can I go to the park?"
Bart,No.
Bart,"Milhouse, this is boring. Make it crash or something!"
Bart,"Stand aside, wussies."
Bart,Enough talk.
Bart,S-U-C-C-E-E-S / That's the way you spell succes--
Bart,"No, no!... He... help!... I'm gonna die!..."
Bart,"You're the man, Homer."
Bart,She makes me taste beer.
Bart,"Oh, I can't believe I gotta spend all my free time dustin' doilies in a smelly, run-down dump for a creepy old witch..."
Bart,"Lady, I gotta tell ya -- I have been grossly misinformed about witches."
Bart,"Wow, man! What is this place?"
Bart,Are you having a party or something?
Bart,He's tough but fair. I'll start sorting these bras.
Bart,Just glad to be on the team!
Bart,"Oh, the ol' greet 'n' toss. No problemo."
Bart,It was his idea.
Bart,So who's gonna warm up the crowd tonight?
Bart,Eep.
Bart,"Heh. Nudist colonies are everywhere these days. I'd love to go, but I... I can't get the wrinkles out of my birthday suit!"
Bart,"But I gotta tell ya, Adam and Eve must have been the first bookkeepers. They invented the loose leaf system."
Bart,"If there's a bad bookkeeping joke, I haven't heard it."
Bart,"Hey, he didn't pay the cover!"
Bart,Nope.
Bart,Yup.
Bart,She did.
Bart,"Hello, Principal Skinner."
Bart,"Dad, we can't let this happen to Belle! Do something!"
Bart,"TO SHUT THEM DOWN NOW WOULD BE TWISTED,"
Bart,"Oh, there's a way, Mom..."
Bart,"All right, Dad, you've been warned. Let's go."
Bart,C'mon...
Bart,"If you really wanted us to be neater, you'd serve us out of one long bowl."
Bart,"Hey, this ain't the Ritz."
Bart,"Mom, Reverend Lovejoy doesn't have a coat. Should I let him in?"
Bart,Hey Lis -- check this out. Non-stick coating.
Bart,"Oooh, a punch bowl like that just screams good taste. Wouldn't it be perfect for the dinner party?"
Bart,"Hello, I'm Dr. Hibbert. I'm afraid I'm going to have to amputate your butt."
Bart,Who's Chase?
Bart,"Hey, I know you from ""American Gladiators."" You're Pyro!"
Bart,Really?
Bart,"Wow, thanks!"
Bart,"Jeez, sorry. It's a pretty standard stunt, Homer."
Bart,"Um, I don't think you want to look in there, sir."
Bart,"Hey, Lis, Mom said you had the toenail clippers and-- Whoa, Lisa! Look out! Nelson's in our house!"
Bart,"Are you nuts? I'll probably never say this to you again, but you can do better."
Bart,Milhouse likes you.
Bart,Hmmm.
Bart,Spin the middle side topwise. Topwise.
Bart,Lisa and I built your room.
Bart,"Uh, I wouldn't take it down if I were you. It's a load-bearing poster."
Bart,"Hey, back off, man."
Bart,I am shocked and appalled.
Bart,Not me. I'm more of a mail-tamperer.
Bart,I'm gonna go claim some valuables at the Lost and Found.
Bart,"Lis, check it out. Time for chili."
Bart,You're just mad cause there's no clock in your hat.
Bart,"Aw, this baby's wasted on an idiot like you. Where's Homer?"
Bart,"So then I says to Mabel, I says..."
Bart,"I'll finish this later. Hi, Dad."
Bart,"So anyway, I says to Mabel, I says..."
Bart,"Hey, look! Is that Dad?"
Bart,"Lis, when you get a little older you'll learn that Friday's just another day between NBC's Must-See Thursday and CBS's Saturday Night Crap-o-rama."
Bart,I am the thing from Uranus!
Bart,It's your birthday?
Bart,We love you boy!
Bart,"Hey, Dad. What's the word from Planet Crackpot?"
Bart,"Well, actually, Dad... I believe you."
Bart,"Yes, I do. You seem so damn sure."
Bart,"Hell, yes."
Bart,What if we don't?
Bart,They'll buy anything!
Bart,"Yo, Dad, can I have a sip of your beer?"
Bart,And that is how much college will cost for Maggie!
Bart,"You know, Dad, it doesn't matter that we didn't see the alien. I've really had a great time out here."
Bart,Oh yes we do! I got it all on tape.
Bart,"Well, Lis, what do you think about the alien now?"
Bart,Leonard Nimoy! What are you doin' here?
Bart,Uh-huh.
Bart,But what's with the glowing?
Bart,I'll handle this.
Bart,Wooo! We're number one! We're number one!
Bart,"Hey, what's going on?! Wait, wait! Hey, let go of me!..."
Bart,"Oh, cheer up, Mom. You can't buy publicity like that. Thousands and thousands of people saw your pretzels injuring Whitey Ford."
Bart,Teamwork is overrated.
Bart,"Think about it. I mean, what ""team"" was Babe Ruth on? Who knows?"
Bart,Sharing is a bunch of bull too. And helping others. And what's all this crap I've been hearing about tolerance?
Bart,"Mom, can Lisa and I play outside, away from the bear?"
Bart,"Lis, Lis, come here! I found two snowflakes that are exactly alike!"
Bart,Oops. Sorry.
Bart,I have a watch with a minute hand.
Bart,"12:80. No, wait. Wait. Wh-- what comes after twelve?"
Bart,"No, after twelve."
Bart,Is there maple syrup in this one?
Bart,"Hey, I'm not gonna get fired. Is there any gold in this mountain?"
Bart,I'll check.
Bart,"Did you hear that, Lis? Dad's gonna be just fine."
Bart,These specials get worse every year.
Bart,"Ma, could you get me some milk?"
Bart,"Oh, that's okay. I'll just go without liquid."
Bart,Thank you.
Bart,Ewwwwww!
Bart,"Ma, I need a glass of milk."
Bart,A nanny?!
Bart,And I'll take up smoking and give that up.
Bart,"MIGHT I ADD, EAT MY SHORTS."
Bart,Just cuttin' through the treacle.
Bart,LET ME GET AWAY WITH MOIDER.
Bart,I have a question.
Bart,"Pop quiz, hotshot. I'm s'posed to be doing my homework, but you find me upstairs reading a Playdude. What do you do? What do you do?"
Bart,"Oh, man."
Bart,IT'S THE AMERICAN WAY!
Bart,"With you, every day is Guy Fawkes Day!"
Bart,"Sing us a song, Shary Bobbins."
Bart,CAN I BE A BOOZEHOUND?
Bart,The secret ingredient is blood.
Bart,Little more -- little more... Little more -- too much. Take it back.
Bart,"Lady, the man asked for a beer, not a song."
Bart,I'll get right on it.
Bart,"I've got a better game. It's called ""Whippin' Cupcakes."""
Bart,You people should be ashamed of yourselves.
Bart,Nope.
Bart,I'M STUCK HERE TILL I CAN STEAL A CAR.
Bart,"Yeah, Mom. I mean, we love you and Dad too, but God knows we don't need to see you every day."
Bart,"Mo-om, you can hug me when I'm asleep."
Bart,Can't we just wander around and meet you back here later?
Bart,"Hey Lis, look! They're adding a new character to Itchy and Scratchy! ""Poochie the Dog?"""
Bart,Haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?
Bart,"Well, here. Say something."
Bart,That hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom.
Bart,I'm not a girl! Are you blind?
Bart,"Mom, can we go to bed without dinner?"
Bart,"Don't have a cow, Lis."
Bart,"Hey, I know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?"
Bart,What? They've given you thousands of
Bart,"hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, if anything, you owe them."
Bart,"Really?! Oh, how terrible!"
Bart,Wow -- Poochie came from another planet?
Bart,"Tough break, dad. I guess people just weren't ready for Poochie. Maybe in a few years."
Bart,It's back to the basics. Classic Itchy and Scratchy!
Bart,What else is on?
Bart,"All right, everybody got their ticket? Then get ready for today's Super-Barto jackpot drawing!"
Bart,Aannd 'round and 'round she -- uh-oh.
Bart,No refunds! Force majeure! Read the back of your ticket!
Bart,"Hey, Lis, check it out! Pogo Stilts! These were banned in all 50 states!"
Bart,"Aw, boo hoo. That's what they get paid for."
Bart,Dad! Dad! Company! Company!
Bart,"Yeah, and he collects toy robots!"
Bart,"Oh, Dad, you are the living end."
Bart,"Hey, where'd that cool creepy Santa come from?"
Bart,"That was a killer tour, man."
Bart,"Hey, Dad, look what I got! Zzzapp!! Zzzapp! Zzzapp! Zzzapp!"
Bart,I'unno. Came outta the closet.
Bart,"Gonna what, Homer?"
Bart,"What are you talking about, Homer? Where are we going?"
Bart,What am I supposed to do here?
Bart,I'unno. I kinda want a cigarette.
Bart,Anything slim!
Bart,Why the hell would I want to see that?
Bart,"Dad, why did you bring me to a gay steel mill?"
Bart,You guys gonna teach me to drive?
Bart,Nope. Something about a bunch of guys alone together in the woods... seems kinda gay.
Bart,"Huh? You did? Wait, man, those are reindeer."
Bart,What? I'm not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.
Bart,Da-ad --
Bart,I didn't do anything.
Bart,"Dad, I'm scared."
Bart,"No, don't! You have to protect yourself!"
Bart,"Dad, are you hurt?"
Bart,"Whoa, it's Santa, all right! And he is kickin' ass!"
Bart,How'd you know that thing would work?
Bart,Huh?
Bart,He thinks I'm gay?
Bart,"Man, those cons love Krusty. Inside every hardened criminal beats the heart of a ten-year-old boy."
Bart,"Yeah, maybe so. But they get the job done."
Bart,"Thanks for trying, guys, but Sideshow Bob wants me dead, and Sideshow Bob is an unstoppable killing machine."
Bart,He's just faking it to get out of jail! He's a maniac!
Bart,"Don't you see what you've done? Sideshow Bob hasn't reformed! He's pure evil! Oh, if only you knew what he was thinking..."
Bart,"And God bless Mom and Dad and Lisa and Maggie, and please, God, kill Sideshow Bob --"
Bart,"It's him or me, O Lord!"
Bart,"He's planning something evil, I know it. It must have something to do with the town's water supply."
Bart,"Um... Nah, that's not his style."
Bart,"Mrs. Krabappel, nooo! That's Sideshow Bob!"
Bart,"I won't be happy until I find out what you're up to. Wherever you go and whatever you do, I'll be there watching and waiting."
Bart,I lied. Now help me rummage through Bob's trash for clues. Then I promise we'll go to the water slide.
Bart,"No, he hasn't. He's more the same than ever. And I know where the evidence is. There's only one place it could possibly be."
Bart,That's even better. Let's go there.
Bart,The Haunted Mine.
Bart,Blueprints... concrete invoices... construction schedule...
Bart,"Oh, yeah? Then explain this!"
Bart,What is Sideshow Bob doing with --
Bart,I hink he nay have spotted us.
Bart,"Give it up, Bob. We found the money."
Bart,"Get 'im, Lis!"
Bart,"Ah, what the hell."
Bart,Let's go again! Let's go again!
Bart,Nooo!
Bart,Guess who!
Bart,By throwing me off a dam? Isn't that a little crude for a genius like you?
Bart,I guess this is it. Thanks anyway.
Bart,Do we have to?
Bart,"Yeah... I guess this means you can't ever try to kill me again, huh?"
Bart,"Heh, funny, isn't it, Lis? Those people down there have no idea how close they came to complete destruction."
Bart,All the best bands are affiliated with Satan.
Bart,"Hey, Dad, how come you're wearing a tuxedo?"
Bart,Why you wearing it now?
Bart,You made all that money for sitting around and watching TV and eating food?
Bart,"Man, if I was making that kind of money, I'd be out of here so fast..."
Bart,"And Dad, you look totally classy. You could be Abe Lincoln's father's boss!"
Bart,So when's Grampa getting here to babysit?
Bart,Not Patty and Selma!
Bart,What?!
Bart,"Dad, help me out!"
Bart,This is an outrage! I am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is! This is the greatest injustice in the history of the world!
Bart,You're dead.
Bart,You are so dead.
Bart,May I have some more lima beans?
Bart,More than that.
Bart,More.
Bart,More.
Bart,More.
Bart,"I didn't say I was gonna eat them. I just wanted to look at them, because they're so gross. What's for dessert?"
Bart,"Oh, I'm a baby, huh? Well, then I'll act like a baby."
Bart,Ga-ga-goo-goo.
Bart,"Oh, baby hate bib. Waah! Waah!"
Bart,Relax. I'll give her some ice cream.
Bart,"Well, I guess that'll make things more interesting for you now, won't it?"
Bart,I am!
Bart,"That's right, I want the 25-foot Italian party sub. And don't skimp on the vinegar. It's time Lisa learned what babysitting Bart Simpson is all about..."
Bart,"Um, yes, I'd like to host an A.A. meeting. Tonight, if possible."
Bart,I'm using non-violent resistance.
Bart,Who?
Bart,You're the boss.
Bart,"Yeah, right, ""bread."" You said go to ""bread""..."
Bart,"Yeah, ""go to bread."""
Bart,"Ohhhhh, bed! Oh. Well, anything you say, sis."
Bart,You didn't say which bed!
Bart,Make me!
Bart,"If you want me, you gotta catch me!"
Bart,Almost!
Bart,Oooh -- Oh -- so close!
Bart,"Uh, yeah, I think so... It's just a bump on my head..."
Bart,"Yah! Oh, cool, it must be dislocated or something..."
Bart,And get this fixed? What's the rush? Don't you want everyone to see what a responsible babysitter you were?
Bart,"Oh, no! I'm going to preserve the evidence until Mom and Dad get home..."
Bart,And you'll never baby-sit again!
Bart,I'm afraid you'll hurt me again!
Bart,I'm banging my head! I'm going to make the lump even bigger!
Bart,It's true!
Bart,"It's all right. I was hoping they'd give me one of those steel claws, but what're ya gonna do?"
Bart,I'm... I'm sorry I was such a jerk last night. Guess I sort of ruined your babysitting business.
Bart,No thanks.
Bart,"You sure look stupid in that green dress, Lis."
Bart,"Hey, everybody's wearing green --"
Bart,"Oh, no..."
Bart,Ow! Quit it!
Bart,"Mom, can I go buy one of those long plastic horns?"
Bart,I get bored with them... but that won't happen this time.
Bart,"Beep beep! Comin' through! Hey, Notre Dame, move it or lose it! Ah-oo-ga! Will the owner of the great big butt please move it out of my face?"
Bart,"Hey, give me some room! Watch the elbow, Seamus!"
Bart,What are yew lookin' at?
Bart,I'm going down to Moe's for a coupla beers.
Bart,"Aw, rats, another gutter ball! Gee, Homer, you sure do suck tonight!"
Bart,"I'm trying, Dad."
Bart,"Whoa, bonanza! Let's load it up before the rats regroup."
Bart,Yeah. Look at him trying to aim that stupid gun.
Bart,Dad! Knocking over a gravestone is bad luck!
Bart,"Oh, so many wasted nights..."
Bart,"Uh, Dad..."
Bart,"All the beer from the landfill is gone, Beer Baron. We're out of business."
Bart,One of the stills --
Bart,I guess we could go to Martin's party...
Bart,"We're at what now, three?"
Bart,"Uh -- Mrs. K! Hey, it's Saturday! Your powers are useless against me."
Bart,Okay. So...
Bart,Excuse me.
Bart,"Hey, Houdini, why don't you saw Martin in half?"
Bart,"Oh, man."
Bart,That's it. Looking good. Getting warm...
Bart,"Don't stop, Milhouse. You're so close!"
Bart,"Eh, I gave my oysters to the cat."
Bart,"Hey, why'd you eat them? I thought you were a vegetarian."
Bart,"You are never going to guess what I saw at Martin's party after you guys left! You know that playhouse? Well, I..."
Bart,"So I looked in the window and there it was, the grossest sight I have ever..."
Bart,That's the best you can do? You could've at least said you were giving her CPR or rehearsing a play.
Bart,Like me for one.
Bart,Deal.
Bart,Stop pushing me. What's going on?
Bart,I don't know. I don't think it's important.
Bart,"Oh, I can't take much more of this."
Bart,"You wouldn't happen to have any real cakes around here, would you?"
Bart,"Oh, can't I just turn the page for you?"
Bart,Okay. That one.
Bart,Ow!
Bart,But... But I wasn't...
Bart,I won't say it!
Bart,"Oh... I love you, Edna Krabappel."
Bart,They're not going to get away with this.
Bart,"Oh, now Martin's scoring off of me. Oh, that is it. Listen up, everybody! Follow me!"
Bart,"Okay crew, set your faces to stunned."
Bart,"You, you, uh, wanted to see me, Principal Skinner?"
Bart,Wait a second. You don't have to leave just because Superintendent Chalmers told you to.
Bart,"You've spent your whole life following orders -- from your mother, the army, Superintendent Chalmers. Just this once, man, stand up for yourself."
Bart,"Obviously, you two have no experience causing a scene."
Bart,Did you check your pocket?
Bart,You got it!
Bart,Turn the music off!
Bart,"Well, that's nice. But first, you've gotta grab their attention. And I think I know how..."
Bart,"I'm outta here. Skinny, Krabby, catch ya later."
Bart,"Oh, no problemo. So, I guess now you'll be getting married or something, huh?"
Bart,Huh?
Bart,"Aw, but you seemed like such a good couple."
Bart,"Oh, how come I never get any mail?"
Bart,"Gas your termites... ""Freeze your termites""... ""Zap your termites""... ""Save the termites""... Hel-lo."
Bart,"""Dear Occupant: Because of your fine credit history, you have been pre-approved for a MoneyBank charge card..."""
Bart,"Hoo, baby! Okay, lessee now... ""Occupation?"" Hmm, butt Doctor. ""Income?"" Whatever I finds, I keeps! ""Name?"" Hmm, name, name...."
Bart,My name is... Santa's Little Helper.
Bart,"Wow, my own credit card! Thanks, ""Santos!"""
Bart,"A quarter?! Well, you're just the dog that keeps on giving, aren'cha?"
Bart,"... and ""Zebra Girl,"" and ""Zillionaire,"" and ""Zoidzilla."""
Bart,"Oh my, yes. Hmm, I'll take that hardbound Radioactive Man collection."
Bart,"Put it all on my credit card, my good man."
Bart,"Oh, what good's a credit card if you can't even use it?"
Bart,Order by phone. 1-800 -- Our phone doesn't go up to eight hundred. Unless...
Bart,"Mom, this is for you: 15 pounds of"
Bart,Vancouver smoked salmon. Here. Smell it!
Bart,And for Homer --
Bart,And for the college-bound... 500 stay-alert capsules.
Bart,Let me answer that question with... cookware!
Bart,"Aw, you've been all edgy and suspicious ever since I gave you those pep pills."
Bart,"What are you talking about? I don't need pep pills to be suspicious if I want to comment on it I'll comment on it who's gonna stop me, you, Pep pill Boy? Pep Boys pills Beverly Sills oh boy oh boy oh boy uh-oh uh-oh oh boy I gotta start taking those pills again you think you're so great..."
Bart,"C'mon, boy, let's go for a walk!"
Bart,"No, not you -- Laddie."
Bart,"Whoa! ""The crowning achievement of the dogmaker's art. This limited edition Collie comes fully trained by Major Jonas Fong, A.L.B.D.A... only 800 will be bred... quite possibly the World's Best Dog."""
Bart,Twelve hundred bucks?! I better just get one.
Bart,"Hey, where are you going?"
Bart,"""Hello, my name is Laddie. I've been trained to gather fruit for you as a welcome gift."""
Bart,Good dog.
Bart,"Okay, watch this. Watch. Do a back-flip, Laddie!"
Bart,"Uh, to the best of my recollection, yes."
Bart,He's trained to do all sorts of stuff. He can herd sheep and perform CPR.
Bart,Hullo?
Bart,Uhh...
Bart,"C'mon, I've got a job for you."
Bart,Good boy.
Bart,"Oh no, repo men. Laddie, hide behind that bush there."
Bart,"Mom and Dad aren't home, are they?"
Bart,The dog and I got a credit card and...
Bart,"Okay, so I committed a little mail fraud. Haven't I been punished enough?"
Bart,"Yeah, that's him all right."
Bart,"Sorry, boy. I didn't plan this. It just sort of happened."
Bart,"Mom, can I feed Laddie at the table?"
Bart,"Um, I took him to a kennel... two towns over. Just 'til the new dog gets settled."
Bart,"Uh, yeah."
Bart,Santa's Little Helper? I guess I was the only one who loved him.
Bart,"Yeah, he was a great dog."
Bart,"Oh, Santa's Little Helper, I was crazy to give you up for another dog. What have I done to you?"
Bart,"Nah, that's not too likely."
Bart,"But still... you're gone. Oh, where are you, boy?"
Bart,Time for a walk. Again? We gotta find out where he's keeping these.
Bart,"Now what?! C'mon, I wanna go home."
Bart,Now can we go home?
Bart,"Why don't you guys take him. I thought he was the right dog for me, but I guess I made a mistake."
Bart,"Uh, Dad? Laddie's not coming. I gave him away."
Bart,No. He just wasn't the right dog for me. I'm sure he'll be happy as a police dog.
Bart,"We can't. He's not in a kennel. I gave him away, too, and I don't know where he is."
Bart,"I'm sorry, I know it's wrong. I messed everything up and now I don't have any dogs at all."
Bart,I don't want a new dog. I want Santa's Little Helper.
Bart,You're right. I'll do it.
Bart,I'm going to get the dog back.
Bart,The bad dog.
Bart,"Excuse me, sir. Did you repossess this dog from a guy named Santos L. Halper?"
Bart,"Oh, I see. You hate him, so you gave him to the church."
Bart,That's him all right. I'll be happy to take him off your hands.
Bart,You didn't crucify him?
Bart,"Hey, it's him! It's Santa's Little Helper!"
Bart,My name is Bart Simpson. I have to talk to you about your dog.
Bart,"Okay, showtime!"
Bart,"""Please, mister... "" No, let me do that again. ""Please, mister... please?!"""
Bart,You're the guy who owns the dog?
Bart,Sprinkles?!
Bart,"Oh, nothin'. Forget it."
Bart,... So that's my plan. I'm gonna break into the blind man's yard and swipe the dog.
Bart,"Hey, I'm not saying it's gonna be a dance around the maypole."
Bart,I can't promise I'll try. But I'll try to try.
Bart,"Here, boy! Come on!"
Bart,Psst!
Bart,"Oh, I missed you so much, boy! C'mon, let's get outta here! Now keep quiet, okay?"
Bart,"C'mon, boy. Let's blow."
Bart,"No, mister! Please, I'm just a kid. I... I only came to get my dog back."
Bart,...and I miss him so much and I know you like him but I like him too and he was mine first and I know I don't deserve him but...
Bart,"Yes, please."
Bart,"C'mon, Santa's Little Helper! I'm sorry I ever let you go! Pick me! Please pick me!"
Bart,"Attaboy! I knew you'd come! Gimme a kiss! Oh, yeah!"
Bart,"Oh geez, I'm sorry. I wish there was some way we could both have a dog."
Bart,"Bye, Laddie."
Bart,"Come on, boy, let's go home and have some fun. That cat's been strutting around like she owns the place..."
Bart,"Aw, recycling is useless, Lis. Once the sun burns out, this planet is doomed. You're just making sure we spend our last days using inferior products."
Bart,Only the stupid ones.
Bart,You found a candy bar?
Bart,I'll do it this afternoon...
Bart,"Lis, have I told you lately that I love you?"
Bart,Turn it down! We don't wanna wake up mom and dad!
Bart,"Thank you, Lord, for delivering us from Reverend Lovejoy!"
Bart,We'll bring you back something nice.
Bart,Lisa! Dad! C'mere quick! There is something that you won't believe!
Bart,Maybe it's a box from the future!
Bart,"Hey, if they got a picture of you, that means they can see you. They're probably watching us right now."
Bart,Bor-ing.
Bart,"Yep. There's your answer, Fish Bulb."
Bart,We are home.
Bart,"No, act like a lion!"
Bart,They're gonna kill him?
Bart,Wow.
Bart,I'm outta here.
Bart,A buck!
Bart,Cool! What'd I buy?
Bart,Looks like my years of hard work have finally paid off.
Bart,Wow! It's filthy... and it's mine.
Bart,"Hey, Milhouse! You want a job in my factory?"
Bart,"Hey, I'm a busy man. You want a job or not?"
Bart,"He's got you there, Dad."
Bart,I think we both know the answer to that..
Bart,Get to work.
Bart,Wacky shack!
Bart,"Solve your problem, Milhouse?"
Bart,"Just a minute, Van Houten. Somebody needs to guard this place tonight so it doesn't get trashed. How'd you like to be night watchman?"
Bart,"Ah, no problemo. Here's a nickel for the coffee machine."
Bart,"Aw, geez!"
Bart,"Milhouse, how could you let this happen? You were supposed to be the night watchman."
Bart,Wow. I wonder where all the rats are gonna go.
Bart,"Mardi Gras, man! When the Big Easy calls, ya gotta accept the charges!"
Bart,"STEP BACK, MOM! IT'S BART'S TURN NOW! / EAT MY SHORTS! DON'T HAVE A COW!"
Bart,"Wait a minute! Whoa, whoa! Stop the music! Where's Dad?"
Bart,"Hey, would you two close the dam door?"
Bart,But that's where we live -- a dam.
Bart,I WANT CANDY!
Bart,Hitchhike -- it's faster!
Bart,Testing...
Bart,Testing...
Bart,Hmm. Hmm. Hey...
Bart,Testing...
Bart,"I know, I'll go to my room and think about what I did."
Bart,You're the boss.
Bart,"Wow, I can't believe we're going to Disneyland! Hey, where's all your luggage?"
Bart,Military school?! You lied to me!
Bart,Freak-outs?
Bart,"Please don't make me stay, Dad! I'll do anything you say! I'll find religion! I'll be good sometimes!"
Bart,No!
Bart,No jail can hold me!
Bart,I want to quit and come home.
Bart,I want to quit and come home.
Bart,"""I'll die before I surrender, Tim."" Who's Tim?"
Bart,"Cleaning graffiti off a statue makes a mockery of everything I stand for. I don't think I can survive here, Lis."
Bart,Did I?
Bart,What is it?
Bart,"Gee, Lis, I'd love to, but this really isn't a good time..."
Bart,Uh...
Bart,I'm talking to... no one.
Bart,"I'm sorry I froze you out, Lis. I--I just didn't want the guys to think I'd gone soft on the girl issue."
Bart,"But if you quit, it'll be like an expert knot-tier quitting a knot-tying contest right in the middle of tying a knot!"
Bart,"I dunno. I was just looking at my shoelaces. Look, the point is, you're going to make it, Lis. And I'm going to stick by you."
Bart,Then I'll just stick by you in secret. Like a sockmaker secretly working on a top secret sock that...
Bart,My killing teacher says I'm a natural.
Bart,"That's it, Lis. Now start crawling."
Bart,I thought you came here looking for a challenge.
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,Nothin'.
Bart,"Oh yeah? Well, um... what are you doing out here?"
Bart,Well. Okay.
Bart,Then carry on.
Bart,That was close.
Bart,Bees! Yaargh!
Bart,"Uh, you can make it, Lisa! I know you can! Come on, I know you can do it! Just get your hands back on the rope! It's just a little further! Come on, just a little bit more. Etc. I know you can do it! I believe in you!"
Bart,"Lisa, it's over, you made it. You can put your arms down."
Bart,"Sir, yes sir! Luckily, I am now trained in six additional forms of unarmed combat, sir!"
Bart,Yeah! That's what people do in Russia!
Bart,Nine bucks?! This one's on me.
Bart,That took too long! How come we had to transfer in Atlanta twice?
Bart,"Look, it's ZZ Top! You guys rock!"
Bart,"Hey immigrants, beat it! Country's full!"
Bart,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm sorry to disturb your pleasant ride, but unlike yourselves, I was born without taste buds. Let me demonstrate."
Bart,I'm in over my head here. Thank you for your time.
Bart,You're the boss.
Bart,"Speaking of shoes, I don't care about shoes. I'll meet you ladies back here in half an hour."
Bart,"Excuse me, is this MAD Magazine?"
Bart,"Uh, seriously, though -- my name is Bart Simpson. My father has a subscription. I'd like the grand tour, please."
Bart,Oh. Okay.
Bart,Woooooow. I will never wash these eyes again.
Bart,"When I grow up, I want to be in the Betty Ford Center."
Bart,"Hey, it's Dad! Right on time!"
Bart,Our class is making refreshments for Skinner's party. These are in honor of his Army days.
Bart,"My theory is, Skinner likes dog food."
Bart,I hope you all brought forks and plates!
Bart,Principal Skinner?
Bart,Come on! Get to the part where you steal his identity!
Bart,"Oh, it's one of those stories."
Bart,"Hey, Armin."
Bart,Mrs. Krabappel sent me. I forged my dad's signature on my report card.
Bart,"Well, I don't see how me signing Homer's name is any different from you using Sgt. Skinner's name."
Bart,"Hey, hey, hey! Easy there, you big impostor."
Bart,He lied about his name.
Bart,"Not if you called 'em ""stench blossoms""."
Bart,"Hey America, you're so fine. You're so fine, you blow my mind. America."
Bart,"Oh, I thought I'd check out the Warner Brothers Network."
Bart,All right! They're gonna show his disastrous marriage to Mia Farrow!
Bart,"Oh yeah? My dear Lisa, you are eight and I am ten. And in my two extra years on this planet, I've learned a few tricks. Gimme that sax!"
Bart,I said gimme!
Bart,Hey!
Bart,School will be fun!
Bart,B-I- -O
Bart,B-I---O
Bart,B-I-
Bart,AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O!
Bart,Very nice.
Bart,"Hey, she's just giving the public what it wants. Bart by the barrel ful."
Bart,"A, B, C... Uh... line?"
Bart,"D, E... Um... line?"
Bart,No.
Bart,I did.
Bart,No.
Bart,"Uh, Homer? It's five years later and I'm still miserable at school."
Bart,Even me?
Bart,Hi.
Bart,I wish I was interesting like you.
Bart,I am?
Bart,Hm...
Bart,Doody. Booger.
Bart,Skinner is a nut! He has a rubber butt!
Bart,The principal said potty!
Bart,Eat my shorts!
Bart,"Yeah, eat my shorts. Buttman... da da da da da da da da... Buttman."
Bart,Wow. So that's how Lisa got her sax.
Bart,"Yeah, not to mention lookin' like a pig, eatin' like a pig..."
Bart,"Hey Einstein , how much for the mood pants?"
Bart,"Hey Dad, can I use the transporter sometime? Please, I swear I'll be careful."
Bart,"Okay, cat. Now, if this works, your next trip will be to the bank vault."
Bart,"Whoa, cool! Twice the pet and none of the mess."
Bart,Ohh. Uhl. You can be Lisa's.
Bart,Hmm...
Bart,Look in the sky! It's Superfly!
Bart,I'd be stupid not to do this.
Bart,"It worked! I was hoping to be humongous. Oh well, at least I don't have two butts."
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,Oh! Ow! Uh!
Bart,Help me! Help meeeee!
Bart,Sucker!
Bart,That imposter!
Bart,Mom! Dad! I'm the real Bart! That's just some overgrown fly with my body! Somebody listen to me!
Bart,"Listen, buddy -- this is all a mistake. If you'll just go through the transporter with me again, we'll have you back eating garbage in no time."
Bart,"Help me, Lis! That giant fly stole my body, and now he's trying to kill me!"
Bart,Get my filthy hands off my sister!
Bart,Whoa! No! Don't eat me! You don't know where I've been!
Bart,Lisa Simpson!
Bart,She put a spell on me!
Bart,Must-drop-pantaloons.
Bart,"Well, I'll be a son of a witch!"
Bart,"Hey, Dad, how come you've never taken us to see a soccer game?"
Bart,Yo Paella Man! Wing one up here!
Bart,Let's wait until they burn the school down.
Bart,"Hey Dad, can I borrow the gun tomorrow? I want to scare that old security guard at the bank."
Bart,"Missed one, Dad."
Bart,Uhmm...
Bart,I don't feel them.
Bart,"First, it's fudge-cicle... And I know they're up there. I just need a better foothold."
Bart,Hello.
Bart,"And the next marksman is... William Tell, Jr.!"
Bart,I certainly am.
Bart,"Hey, we got a pool!"
Bart,Wow! The TV's coin-operated.
Bart,"I'd like to order a wake-up call, please... three AM... ah, for every room except this one... that's right. Goodnight."
Bart,Always love tryin' out new material on the road.
Bart,"No way are you gonna to beat me this time, Lis!"
Bart,"Come on, Smelly!"
Bart,"Hey, is that a camera in the ceiling?"
Bart,I'm comfortable with who I am.
Bart,"Yeah, but I could get seriously hurt."
Bart,"Okay, Milhouse, lets try out the new cup."
Bart,Again.
Bart,Cool!
Bart,All right!
Bart,It's clobberin' time.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"Good morning, everybody."
Bart,What did I do?
Bart,"Oh, man."
Bart,"But, Coach?"
Bart,Nelson's a great quarterback. He's carryin' this team!
Bart,But I can't play quarterback. I don't even know how.
Bart,Since when?
Bart,"Dad, the car!"
Bart,"Ready. Set. Hut, hut!"
Bart,Yahh!
Bart,"Aw, crap."
Bart,Are you kidding? I reeked!
Bart,"Gimme a ""B""?"
Bart,It's gonna take a miracle for me to become a good quarterback.
Bart,"Wow, Joe Namath!"
Bart,"I cannot believe you are here! Do you think, maybe, you could give me some pointers?"
Bart,"Okay, Bart. Concentrate."
Bart,I'm dead.
Bart,"... So if I play, the guys are gonna kill me. If I don't, I'll be letting Homer down. What am I gonna do?"
Bart,Good.
Bart,"Dad, I've got some bad news."
Bart,"No, I got hit by a couple of cars. I won't be able to play today."
Bart,"No, I'm not. I suck."
Bart,"You don't get it, do you? I don't want to be your stupid quarterback! I quit!"
Bart,"May I be excused, Mom?"
Bart,This thing only takes dollars.
Bart,But I thought Uter took my place.
Bart,"It's okay Dad, I can fill in for Nelson."
Bart,"So what's the charge, Chief? Vandalism? Smoking?"
Bart,Wuh?
Bart,Lazy bums.
Bart,"Yeah, good one."
Bart,"Yeah, can you see out of it? Does it change colors when you're ticked off?"
Bart,Nothing yet.
Bart,"As long as you have absolutely no follow-up questions... yes. Yes, we are."
Bart,What's a castrati?
Bart,I unno.
Bart,Almost...
Bart,Tradition.
Bart,Wow! I wish I had an elephant.
Bart,"Oh, yeah."
Bart,But we didn't enter any police raffle.
Bart,Dad? Why aren't you saying anything? Where's our motorboat?
Bart,"It's probably a million years old, Dad. I think it's as valuable as it's gonna get."
Bart,We should have lived together first.
Bart,Good ol' Bluey.
Bart,I could take up smoking.
Bart,"Give her a nice cell. Somethin' in ""C"" block."
Bart,"Why are we getting dressed up, Mom? Are we going to Black Angus?"
Bart,So we're not going to Black Angus.
Bart,"'Course, we'll have to cut back on our own homework."
Bart,Superman.
Bart,Not in my damn house.
Bart,They back your baaaannk!
Bart,You didn't do anything.
Bart,Works for the Lumber King.
Bart,So long! / Good-bye! / Good luck!
Bart,"Yeah, you did the right thing... eventually."
Bart,"Aww, thanks, Mom."
Bart,Could it be...?
Bart,It's crap-tacular.
Bart,"""Hocus-pocus, mucus-pukus..."" My powers of deduction tell me you're getting a hand-made sweater. Possiblyyy yellow."
Bart,"Ah, 12 glasses of water. That'll wake me up nice and early, and I'll have a big head-start on opening presents. Pure genius."
Bart,"It's always about the Indians, isn't it, Lis?"
Bart,"Dear Santa. If you bring me lotsa good stuff, I promise not to do anything bad between now and when I wake up. Amen."
Bart,Owww! I'll kill you!
Bart,Worked like a charm.
Bart,Oh! Oh! Oh!
Bart,How sweet it is!
Bart,"Oh, Aunt Selma. Always good for a fin. Whoa-ho-ho. Here we go."
Bart,The Inferno-buster 3000! I knew Santa wouldn't have time to check that list twice.
Bart,Whoa... Yeah...
Bart,Cool...
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,Eep.
Bart,Who designed this house?!
Bart,"Snow covers all. Pure, white snow."
Bart,I gotta get back to bed!
Bart,"I don't know how to tell you this, but... I came down a little early and... um... well... uh..."
Bart,I saw - a burglar and he was - he took - and he got all our stuff. Including the tree.
Bart,Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh.
Bart,I know...
Bart,"Well, he had a glass eye, a wooden leg, um... big scar on his cheek..."
Bart,"Hooks for hands. Um, oh, uh, and he was wearing a striped convict shirt. And he was carrying a big sack with a dollar sign on it."
Bart,"Hey, since when is Christmas just about the presents? Aren't we forgetting the true meaning of this day? The birth of Santa?"
Bart,"Ohhh, I don't like where this is goin'."
Bart,"Please, I don't deserve this."
Bart,"I don't know about this, Dad. Shouldn't we give the money to charity or some...? Ow!"
Bart,Ow! You're still doing it.
Bart,Will this Christmas never end?
Bart,"No, away from the skid!"
Bart,Hit the brakes! / Floor it! / Stop! / To the left! / Head back!
Bart,I couldn't sleep.
Bart,There was no burglar.
Bart,I accidentally burned up the tree and the presents. I'm really sorry.
Bart,"Wait! He's just covering for me! I destroyed the presents, then I buried the evidence. And I acted alone."
Bart,"Yeah, but they've still got plenty of pumpkins."
Bart,Yeah. Plus lots of other stuff.
Bart,"Hey, that's my washcloth."
Bart,Head her off at the stairs!
Bart,She's going around the other side. Now get her!
Bart,"So prepare yourself, for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of Joshua Logan's, ""Paint Your Wagon!"""
Bart,"Yeah, their guns are right there!"
Bart,WAKE UP DAD / YOU'RE SINGING A SONG!
Bart,"MOM WAS RIGHT, YOUR SINGING'S A SIN / YOU'RE AS LES MISERABLES / AS LEE MAR-VIN!"
Bart,Eep.
Bart,I HATE TO DANCE AND PRANCE AND SING / THAT'S REALLY MORE OF A MILLHOUSE THING!
Bart,IT STILL WASN'T WORTH BURNS' SONG AND DANCE.
Bart,SPRINGFIELD SWINGS LIKE A PENDULUM DO!
Bart,AND IT REALLY DOES BLOW...
Bart,"Done, done."
Bart,"Turn on the TV, Lis."
Bart,Allowance Day. Ding ding ding ding ding.
Bart,We'll take it under advisement.
Bart,But I can't go out dressed like this! What if someone sees me?
Bart,"Aw, man. Look at all this stuff: ""Pull weeds, mow lawn, scoop and bag 'dog business...'"""
Bart,"There's gotta be a way out of this. Lisa, chop off my hands!"
Bart,"All right, you chop my hands half way off and then I'll still have enough strength to chop..."
Bart,Sounds great.
Bart,"Work was hard, so we quit."
Bart,And Santy Claus provides the rest.
Bart,We need money fast!
Bart,I wanna go on the Yard-work Simulator!
Bart,"Wow, the Tooth Chipper!"
Bart,Out of my way! I'm Hitler!
Bart,"Two tickets? Whoa, what a break!"
Bart,"Um, I think that one's broken."
Bart,"Quick, Dad. Before somebody else wins it!"
Bart,"Wow, it's fuehrer-rific!"
Bart,Hm... One of these must activate the flame thrower.
Bart,Uh oh.
Bart,Cops took it.
Bart,At the carnival? Cool!
Bart,Woo hoo!
Bart,"Starting today, we're carnies. Just like you."
Bart,Yes!
Bart,"So what's our first job, huh? Test the roller coaster?"
Bart,Hose down the freaks?
Bart,"Ohh, this isn't fun... Maybe if you didn't go to the bathroom so much, you wouldn't be so small."
Bart,"Yeah, Dad?"
Bart,Does it matter?
Bart,"Dad, we're saved!"
Bart,"Like ""rubes""?"
Bart,Good move.
Bart,"Lookie, lookie, hey, hey, wocka, wocka! I got rings and you want 'em! Win a genuine Ronex watch. Just like a real moogie star!"
Bart,"Aw, c'mon, Dad. Get on the trolley."
Bart,"Hey, highpockets! Win somethin' for your girlfriend?"
Bart,"If I like ya, it is."
Bart,"We're natural born carnies, Dad. If only we weren't tied down with a family..."
Bart,"Um, hey, Dad, I, I think he wants a..."
Bart,I'm goin' for a corn dog. You want one?
Bart,Wow. Can you do that again?
Bart,"Thanks for dinner, Mom. I love you."
Bart,Spud taught me that.
Bart,"Hey, come on, Sharky. / Hey, you want a piece of this? / You call yourself the king of the jungle? / Etc."
Bart,Check this out!
Bart,So. I let you use my leaves.
Bart,I say we set fire to the house. Kill 'em that way.
Bart,"Oh, you'll never make it, Dad!"
Bart,"Way to go, Dad. You actually outwitted someone."
Bart,Mom. Get him away from the window.
Bart,"Thanks for lettin' me skip school to see the team come back from the championship, Dad."
Bart,"C'mon, Dad! The team's arriving!"
Bart,"Church, cult. Cult, church. So we get bored someplace else every Sunday. Does this really change our day-to-day lives?"
Bart,"Yeah, maybe it'll wear off. Like his interest in C.B. radio."
Bart,"I kinda think it's cool. Just pretend you're in a zombie movie. Besides, this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc."
Bart,These rubes in robes haven't met the likes of Bart Simpson before.
Bart,I love the Leader.
Bart,"The Leader, Ma'am."
Bart,"Oh, I should know this one. Th--The Leader?"
Bart,"Well, can we at least keep the bikes?"
Bart,Does anyone here like food?
Bart,"You said it, sister."
Bart,"Whoa, cool! God is so in-your-face."
Bart,But the flood's only knee-high! At least let us watch 'til the midgets drown.
Bart,"Go, Lis! Way to cite precedent! Ah ha!"
Bart,"Lighten up, Lis."
Bart,"Oh, grow up, Lis."
Bart,"Yes, sir, you American pig."
Bart,"Ah, uh-hum. Let's see. Ah. The exports of Libya are numerous in amount. One thing they export is corn..."
Bart,"Or as the Indians call it, maize. Another famous Indian was Crazy Horse. In conclusion, Libya is a land of contrasts. Thank you."
Bart,Point of odor. Lisa stinks.
Bart,First one to the front of the bus gets Martin's lunch money.
Bart,Go apple!
Bart,"I guess this is the end, Wendell."
Bart,Whatever. Just tell Wendell I said bye.
Bart,"What's everyone's problem? I'm glad we're stranded. It'll be just like the Swiss Family Robinson, only with more cursing. We're gonna live like kings. Damn hell ass kings!"
Bart,... And every night the monkey butlers will regale us with jungle stories.
Bart,One at first. But he'll train others.
Bart,"Good, let's get to work. Me and Nelson will build the treehouse. Martin, draw up plans for a coconut radio and, if possible, a coconut Nintendo system."
Bart,You guys gather food for the big feast tonight. And maybe a little wine for the older kids.
Bart,Exactly.
Bart,"Food patrol, we're all starved. Let's see what you've got."
Bart,"That's it? What happened to all the lobsters, mangoes and chewy chewy cocoa beans?"
Bart,"How are they, Ralph? Good?"
Bart,"Okay, food patrol blew it."
Bart,"Well, when monsoon season comes, you'll be glad it's there."
Bart,"Oh. No food, no shelter, no monkey butlers... This island is a death-hole. We should've just swum for it like Otto."
Bart,"No it's not, it's my tummy. I mean stomach. Gut. Crap factory."
Bart,"Hey, yeah! And I think I know how I can get it."
Bart,No talking in the cage. Court is now in session. All rise.
Bart,Ah-ha! Made you rise.
Bart,"I remind you, we are not here to debate the existence of monsters."
Bart,"Prosecutor, your witness."
Bart,Hmm. I'm gonna allow this.
Bart,"After careful deliberation, it's my opinion that Milhouse probably did eat the food. But since there's no proof, I must find him not guilty."
Bart,"I don't know, Lis... to be honest, that verdict made me pretty angry."
Bart,"Hey, man! Leave my sister alone!"
Bart,"Here, Milhouse, you go first."
Bart,"Oh. Gee thanks, mister."
Bart,"Okay, now throw the vine back!"
Bart,"Hey, look at his tusk!"
Bart,"Mmm. Mm. How's your dinner, Lis?"
Bart,What do we need church shoes for? Jesus wore sandals.
Bart,"Yeah. Excuse me, I'm looking for someone named, Jay Leno."
Bart,"Hey, if you didn't wanna tie shoes, you shouldn't a become a shoe salesman."
Bart,When?
Bart,"Hey, somebody screwed up bad! You've got all these big comics lined up for your show, but there's no Krusty."
Bart,Krusty the Clown!
Bart,Funniest man alive? Prince of Pies? The Sultan of Seltzer?
Bart,Oh.
Bart,"Well, if you're running the show, how could you leave out, Krusty the Clown?"
Bart,"No, he's alive. And he is so funny you could plotz. At least according to his press release."
Bart,Tell him it'll count towards his community service.
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,Woo hoo! Yeah! Krust-ee!
Bart,"Hey Krusty, great set."
Bart,"No! No, I was talkin' to Lisa back there, we both agreed you killed."
Bart,"Oh sure, there were a lotta laughs. Y-You probably couldn't hear 'em, the acoustics were so bad."
Bart,Clear the couch. It's Krusty time!
Bart,"Oh, this sucks. I am outta here."
Bart,"Hey! Get away from him, you little freaks!"
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,"Oh, pew! What were ya drinkin'? Gasoline?"
Bart,"Uh, Krusty..."
Bart,That's one of your posters. I got all the Krusty stuff.
Bart,"Here, here, quick! Use my Krusty eyewash!"
Bart,"Thanks for comin' over, Jay. Krusty really needs help."
Bart,They are just impossible.
Bart,"Well, they are! Anyway, don't you have some advice for Krusty?"
Bart,"Hey, whoa, whoa. Let's not tamper with a classic."
Bart,Dad!
Bart,"... And then, of course, there's Mom, who sounds something like this."
Bart,Eat your vegetables. Take a sweater. I don't think that's a good idea.
Bart,"Thank you. Thank you. And now, the all new comedy stylings of... Krrrusty the Clown..."
Bart,"Krusty, the acoustics in here are..."
Bart,Dad!
Bart,"I don't get it, Krusty. You said you would never be a shill again."
Bart,"Wow, this is roomy!"
Bart,Whoa-ho-ho! Texas snowball fight!
Bart,"Yeah, Mom says a lot of things."
Bart,"You're up to something, aren't you?"
Bart,"Well, Dad, in the meantime, here's a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff."
Bart,Three.
Bart,Guard! Guard!
Bart,"Hey, there's a balloon machine in the bathroom!"
Bart,My Joe isn't sloppy enough!
Bart,What are they doing with our forty-five cents?
Bart,How 'bout this?
Bart,"Hey, Lis. Wanna join us?"
Bart,We're watching the TV.
Bart,"Yes! Heh, heh! / Ha! Ha! / Woo hoo hoo heh heh! / Woo! / Oh! Oh!"
Bart,Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! / Ha! Ha! All right!
Bart,Ha! Ha! Ha! Hee! Hee!/ Woo hoo! Ha! Ha! / I didn't think it was gonna fall over. Ha! Ha!
Bart,Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! / Woo! Woo! Woo!
Bart,The best part was when the buildings fell down!
Bart,"Relax, Lis. Dad and I always have a Plan B."
Bart,"Pretty neat, huh?"
Bart,Whuh?
Bart,No what?
Bart,"Lisa insulted us, Mom. She thinks she's so great. I'll dance on her grave."
Bart,"What? Oh, napkin, right."
Bart,Why is she saying all this? Is she dying?
Bart,"You probably should've researched this first, eh, Dad?"
Bart,"So, wait a minute. This means I'm gonna be a failure?"
Bart,Enh.
Bart,He's a robot. We saw him on the way in.
Bart,Me. I smell a museum.
Bart,"Hey, I'm gonna go toss the virtual salad!"
Bart,"Hey, how do you get this thing to play Blackjack?"
Bart,So how's it supposed to work?
Bart,Bo-ring. Am I on the Internet?
Bart,Bo-ring. What's that fire for?
Bart,Whoa-ho! This whole planet like is one big skate park!
Bart,"Look out, Ralph!"
Bart,"Houston, we have a booger."
Bart,"Good one, guys."
Bart,"Yes, sir."
Bart,Firecrackers. Stinkbombs. Maps to teachers' homes.
Bart,"No, who?"
Bart,You would know.
Bart,Whuh?
Bart,A what? With who?
Bart,Whoa! Get him off! Get him off!
Bart,You want me to hang out with Ralph Wiggum?
Bart,Stop sayin' that!
Bart,Someone will be right with you.
Bart,"Mom, school has changed a lot since you were a kid. Popularity is very important now."
Bart,Don't talk. Listen. The social order of elementary school is densely layered. The coolest kids are at the top.
Bart,"Mom, I don't want to play with Ralph."
Bart,Uh-huh...
Bart,"Well, I don't know about that... It might help him a little..."
Bart,"Hey, wait! I, I didn't agree to..."
Bart,"Mom, I am not..."
Bart,"Ralph, I just got through sorting those."
Bart,"Ralph, would you just --"
Bart,That's not a toy. Hey... Do you know how to play hide and seek?
Bart,These syrup stains are the worst.
Bart,But people will see me paired up with a doofus. You have no idea what that's like.
Bart,I'm going.
Bart,"Well that is your problem, Ralph. This is how I always walk."
Bart,"Quick, Ralph. In the bushes."
Bart,"Hi, guys. Hot enough for ya?"
Bart,That was too close. We gotta stay off the streets.
Bart,"Right, leprechaun."
Bart,"Maybe later. Come on, Ralph -- your Dad's a cop. There must be some cool stuff around here. Bullets, dead body photos, what have you."
Bart,Did he say I'm not allowed in there?
Bart,"Well, I'm going in anyway."
Bart,"Oh Lord, I thank you for this bounty I'm about to receive..."
Bart,"Hmmm. Wow! Dad's been in jail six times. Aw, and Mom's only been in twice."
Bart,We better hide.
Bart,"Quick, in here!"
Bart,"Sorry, Chief. Uhm, we were just playing."
Bart,What's that weird key for?
Bart,The police master key.
Bart,"Oh, Ralph, do you realize what we can do with... Get me a towel."
Bart,So long -- I'm gonna sleep over at Ralph's.
Bart,"Ohh, I found something all right."
Bart,Absolutely.
Bart,The world is our toy store.
Bart,"Ahh, to be eight again..."
Bart,And an entire pan of funeral fudge.
Bart,"Uh, I'll take it from here, Ralph. Umm, we're just hangin', chillin'... little bit of illin'."
Bart,"Oh, yeah? Would a lamewad have the police master key?"
Bart,Really? You think so? I don't know what to say. This is all happening so fast.
Bart,"Those are all moderately cool ideas, but if you really want to walk on the wild side, I know just the place."
Bart,Here she is. The Big House. The Stony Lonesome. The Thug Jug. The Mobster Trap. Penn State. The Old Crook Buck--
Bart,"C'mon, Ralph. Don't embarrass me. It's just an abandoned prison. All the murderers are long dead... and I'm sure their ghosts are probably in hell."
Bart,"Sorry, Ralph."
Bart,"Go on home, Ralph."
Bart,"I can't bail on a friend, even if it is Ralph."
Bart,"Hey, give it back!"
Bart,"Hey, come on! I thought we were friends."
Bart,"Hey, Ralph. You're braver than you thought."
Bart,Wait for me!
Bart,Wow! Look at all these toilets. And just inches from your bed. Talk about luxury.
Bart,"Danger, eh?"
Bart,"Whoa, momma! The electric chair! Smell that, Ralph? That's the smell of justice."
Bart,"Hmm, maybe it still works. Gimme the newlyweds from that cake."
Bart,Stand back!
Bart,What a gyp.
Bart,Till death do you part...
Bart,"Uh-oh, let's get out of here."
Bart,Got any threes?
Bart,"Oh. See, here's the problem, Ralph. You have several threes."
Bart,Why don't we watch cartoons? The Justice League is moving into their new building today.
Bart,Uh-oh. We didn't reset the safety switch.
Bart,"Operator, get me Morningwood Penitentiary. It's an emergency."
Bart,Come on! A man's life is at stake! We need to get a message to the prison!
Bart,Think! Think!
Bart,"That's it! Ralph, you're a genius!"
Bart,They're getting ready to throw the switch!
Bart,"Come on, Lisa! Hurry!"
Bart,"Way to go, Ralph!"
Bart,But asking you was Ralph's idea.
Bart,Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!
Bart,"Aw, let him have this one, Lis. After all, it's Ralph."
Bart,"Hey, Homer, bring me back a torpedo."
Bart,But Flanders got his kids torpedoes.
Bart,"Milhouse, my mom wears earrings -- do you think she's cool?"
Bart,"Hey, if you want cool, check this out. EVERYBODY IF YOU CAN DO THE BARTMAN! SHAKE YOUR BODY TURN IT OUT IF YOU CAN CAN DO THE BARTMAN YEAH!"
Bart,I'd like to get my ear pierced.
Bart,Hello everybody. Sparkle sparkle.
Bart,Milhouse has one.
Bart,Milhouse jumped off a cliff? I'm there!
Bart,"Well, I'm keeping this earring and you can't stop me!"
Bart,Time to reap the benefits of being cool.
Bart,I don't believe this! Everyone's got an earring!
Bart,"Come on, Dad. Didn't you ever do anything wild when you were a kid?"
Bart,Fine. Take it.
Bart,"Then can I get a tattoo that says, ""Bite Me?"" You never know when it might come in handy."
Bart,A king cobra?
Bart,Weapons-grade plutonium?
Bart,Knock-out drops?
Bart,Ninja death stars?
Bart,Cool!
Bart,"There you go, Ratboy."
Bart,My Dad has a trillion dollars? Wow! I can buy and sell your sorry ass. I'll give you a billion dollars to empty the cat box for me.
Bart,"Ready, Milhouse?"
Bart,You owe me a quarter! I didn't crack my skull!
Bart,"Hi, Willie."
Bart,My board!
Bart,I really didn't want it to come to this...
Bart,The man knows quality work.
Bart,What's he gonna do?
Bart,"So who's on your news team? Nerd, nerd... Nelson?!"
Bart,"Well, don't worry about sports. I got that covered."
Bart,Mo-om...
Bart,"So we meet again, Mr. Bond."
Bart,"Silence, Octopussy."
Bart,Bart Simpson telling you to lock the doggy in the barn 'cause here comes dodgeball action!
Bart,"The shirts continued their domination over the skins today. And in schoolyard fights...the highly anticipated match between Kearney and Mr. Largo ended in a disqualification, for use of dog doo on a stick. Lisa?"
Bart,What?!
Bart,"Oooh, that's gotta hurt!"
Bart,"Anchorman, huh? Well, if I'm gonna be an anchorman, I'd better go bleach the crud off my teeth. I'll be in makeup."
Bart,Damn blueberry stains.
Bart,"I'll show Lisa who's dumb. ""Supreme Court reverses..."" I won't turn to the comics, I won't turn to the comics."
Bart,"All right, I'll read one comic just to get me rollin'. ""Archie."" ""Hey, Jughead, didja hear, the Supreme Court reversed..."""
Bart,"Mom, am I dumb?"
Bart,"Mr. Brockman, I need your help. I've got to become a great anchor so I can show up my sister."
Bart,"No, I haven't, Lisa. Because I went out with a camera and did a different kind of story."
Bart,"It's about a man. A simple man. He's one of... ""Bart's People."""
Bart,"Joe Banks, 82 years young, has come to this pond every day for the past 17 years to feed the ducks. But last month, Joe made a discovery. The ducks were gone."
Bart,Some say the ducks went to Canada. Others say Toronto. And some people think that Joe used to sit down there... near those ducks. But it could be that there's just no room in this modern world for an old man and his ducks.
Bart,One man. No ducks. Lisa?
Bart,"Well, I'm sorry you couldn't feel for old Joe."
Bart,"Our forgotten veterans. Their guns are quiet now. Their helmets lost, or pawned. And yet here they are, making flags out of old clothes. Sure, they may not have the right number of stripes, and the colors are all wrong, and some purists will tell you the American flag doesn't contain the word, ""Jordache."" But you know, if they run this up the flagpole, I'll salute. I'm Bart Simpson."
Bart,I just think our veterans deserve a little recognition.
Bart,But is that really enough to honor our brave soldiers?
Bart,"Oh, Lisa, maybe you're right. Maybe you're wrong. The important thing is Veterans deserve a day to honor them."
Bart,"Well, maybe they should have three. I'm Bart Simpson."
Bart,"I wish they could all be Bart's People, Mom. I truly do."
Bart,Hmm. It really makes you think.
Bart,"Well, if I'm guilty of anything, maybe it's caring too much. I'm Bart Simpson."
Bart,"Hey Lis, be a doll and hand me that sealant."
Bart,"Oh, so many souls, so little air time."
Bart,"""Dear Bart, I came to this country, hoping to share the American dream. But after many years of back-breaking labor, I find myself homeless and sleeping in a junkyard."""
Bart,"""Should I abandon hope or fight on bravely against impossible odds? Oh, this is too perfect."
Bart,"I'm gonna put him on the air tonight, live."
Bart,"Naw, I'll just take the chopper."
Bart,"Lisa, I've just arrived at the Springfield dump. A lot of things get thrown out here. Sometimes, even a human being. Somewhere in this pile of twisted metal and soiled mattresses..."
Bart,...lives a poor immigrant whose home was cruelly taken away.
Bart,"Groundskeeper Willie! Uhm. Ah. So, so you're the immigrant I'm here to help."
Bart,"Groundskeeper Willie, furious with the government that let him down. I'm Bart Simp--"
Bart,"Way to go, officer!"
Bart,GAAAH!
Bart,"Hey, Lis. Thanks."
Bart,"Uh, yeah, but I have a certain respect for that whole ""truth"" and ""hard work"" thing that you do."
Bart,"You're right. If we work together, there's no stopping us."
Bart,Shut up! I'm trying to watch this.
Bart,What the hell is this?
Bart,"Uh, maybe later."
Bart,"Yep, that's the rule. He who tops it off, drops it off."
Bart,"See you in hell, brussel sprouts."
Bart,"Goodbye, fine China."
Bart,I think you're startin' to crack.
Bart,No way.
Bart,"Hey, everybody, vote for my Dad, Homer Simpson. If you don't he'll beat us."
Bart,Dealing drugs?
Bart,Some of it is.
Bart,Wowwww! McBain has really buffed up. You could grate cheese on those abs.
Bart,"Mom, a man just died."
Bart,"Gentlemen, the game is capture the flag. Rod, ladies pick first."
Bart,Um... I'll take... Nelson.
Bart,"Yeah, that must be it."
Bart,"Yeah, well, if you get a grown-up, then so do we. I pick my Dad."
Bart,"Oh, you'd be surprised. He gets pretty competitive when he's drinking. C'mon, Dad. We're playing Capture the Flag!"
Bart,But Rod picked his Dad. It's a matter of family honor.
Bart,"Okay, Dad, they've got our flag guarded pretty good..."
Bart,"No, wait. I have a plan. But I'll need your underpants."
Bart,I got it! I got the flag!
Bart,Suckers! Go Dad!
Bart,"Come on, Dad! Just a few more feet! Show 'em what you got!"
Bart,And your chest!
Bart,Whoaa...
Bart,You know Rainier Wolfcastle?
Bart,My Dad could do it!
Bart,He eats fifty dollars' worth of Power Sauce bars a day.
Bart,"Dad, wait. You're not risking your life just to impress me, are you?"
Bart,"Oh, cool! Now get goin', chop-chop!"
Bart,"Uh, Dad?"
Bart,Shouldn't you save a couple bottles for when you're a little higher?
Bart,"Don't get discouraged, Dad. Only four vertical miles to go."
Bart,"Oh, Dad's gonna die and it's all my fault! I really need a good talkin' to."
Bart,Hey! Something's coming down the mountain! Fast!
Bart,"Didja make it to the top, Dad? Huh? Didja?"
Bart,All I see is a pole. Maybe the flag fell off.
Bart,"Forget about it, Homer. You made it to the top. You're the coolest Dad ever."
Bart,Hm. I guess that we don't have to go to school.
Bart,"The world is completely different on a weekday morning. Banks are open, old people are walking the streets with impunity..."
Bart,And look! Barney's not even drunk yet!
Bart,Ah. No day would be completely wasted without a visit to the old joke shop.
Bart,"Rookie mistake, Milhouse."
Bart,Hmm...
Bart,Maybe you can help me. I don't think my face is as hilarious as it could be. What can you show me in a nose or forehead accessory?
Bart,"Well. Thanks, guv'nor."
Bart,"Milhouse, I'm not gonna take dog doo that's been on the dirty ground and put it on my face. I have a better idea."
Bart,"Hey Dad, wake up."
Bart,Ta-da!
Bart,Notice anything new?
Bart,To try and cut back a little?
Bart,It won't come off.
Bart,Ow!
Bart,Ow!
Bart,Ow!
Bart,"Oh, don't be ridiculous."
Bart,"Mom, I didn't eat any of it. I'm not stupid."
Bart,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Bart,"Well, you should have thought of that before I glued all this stuff to my face."
Bart,Couldn't you have just turned up the heat a little?
Bart,But my apologies always sound so forced.
Bart,"Hey, Lis. I'm sorry I ruined your Egyptian thing. We're still buds, right?"
Bart,"Okay, be that way. Be a big, stupid jerk."
Bart,"Oh, you're not the jerk, I am. Forgive me? Oh, like you're Miss Perfect! Mom! Lisa's making me feel bad!"
Bart,That shut her up.
Bart,Ow! That had a guide pin in it.
Bart,Bo-ring. I'll take you to a place that's really romantic.
Bart,When are Mom and Dad coming back?
Bart,"Oh, there's gotta be something to do around here. Hey, are they pulling the plug on anybody today?"
Bart,"Can we borrow this, Grampa?"
Bart,"Yeah, what's with the love thang?"
Bart,Pirate booty. What else?
Bart,"So you see, there's treasure everywhere."
Bart,"Okay, here's the deal. Crowns and doubloons are mine. Snuff boxes and cameos are yours. Now as for wands and scepters..."
Bart,Jewel-encrusted?
Bart,"Whoa, excellent haul!"
Bart,Exactly. Now there's nothing left out there but treasure.
Bart,"Hey, you're back. Did you rock the Casbah?"
Bart,You guys are sick.
Bart,"This is it, Lis. The motherlode."
Bart,"Priceless like a mother's love, or the good kind of priceless?"
Bart,I'll say. Wasn't it great? And the question mark leaves the door open for a sequel.
Bart,What are you talking about? I loved it.
Bart,Wowww.
Bart,He's great! He pokes fun at life's little foibles.
Bart,They're gonna to feel so silly when they realize they forgot us.
Bart,Nah. These days everything's done on computers.
Bart,And staplers. Computers and staplers.
Bart,"Uh, Dad, I don't think the dog can handle any more bacon."
Bart,It's the first day of school.
Bart,"Dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars."
Bart,But doesn't she get her money from you?
Bart,"Um, I don't know how much more school I can miss."
Bart,"Oh, yeah. Good one, Mom."
Bart,"When you want grease, go to the source: good old Krusty Burger."
Bart,I was thinking more of the deep fryer.
Bart,Mom's gonna kill you.
Bart,"Hey, Dad, I've been thinking. What if instead of giving up on grease, we go for one last big score?"
Bart,"Dad, he's not stupid."
Bart,Don't worry. This is the score we've been dreamin' about. The grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied.
Bart,"Uh, nothing."
Bart,Where's the hose?
Bart,Are you as excited as I am?
Bart,"Well, it used to be."
Bart,Uh... guys? Guys? The hose.
Bart,You can't come back later because...
Bart,"Quiet, Dad, or we'll have to throw you outta here."
Bart,Remember when you almost became heavyweight champ?
Bart,"Hang on, Dad, this next part'll definitely make you feel better about yourself."
Bart,I thought he invented the light bulb.
Bart,"Top of the world, ma!"
Bart,Dad? What are you doin' here?
Bart,"That's great, Dad."
Bart,They're all about smugglers.
Bart,"Yeah. He invented stuff, too."
Bart,Butt.
Bart,Booger.
Bart,Can't even spank his own kids...
Bart,I will buy ten of those right now.
Bart,Gangway! Gotta poop.
Bart,Do you mind?
Bart,"Oh yeah, safety sells. Especially to lame-o's."
Bart,"Hey, Dad, heard you swearing. Mind if I join in? Crap. Boobs. Crap."
Bart,"If Edison thought of that chair, how come it's not on this chart?"
Bart,So?
Bart,But I thought you loved Edison.
Bart,"Yeah! Hell, damn, fart!"
Bart,"Man, I can't wait to smash that chair."
Bart,All right! The museum's still open.
Bart,"Your electric hammer, maestro?"
Bart,You mean the wild mood swings?
Bart,Can I?
Bart,"Uh, I think that's in Italy, Dad."
Bart,"I gotta admit, Homer. You're taking this pretty well."
Bart,One stinkin' letter? Why'd you make us gather 'round like that?
Bart,Shut up.
Bart,"Yeah, Lis. She is a smart, sophisticated woman. Now let's hear more about that big, big reward."
Bart,"We're all proud of you, Dad."
Bart,"Wow, you sure get a lot of balls for a quarter."
Bart,"Okay, what can I get for twelve, count 'em, twelve prize tickets?"
Bart,"Whoa, can I try that some time?"
Bart,"Wow, thanks, Nelson! I'll come by your house later --"
Bart,"But, Mom --"
Bart,"But, Mom --"
Bart,That's all I got.
Bart,Mustache comb. What'd you get?
Bart,This sucks. It's time to punch outta this yawn factory. I'm going to Nelson's.
Bart,"She doesn't scare me. I do what I want, when I want. Oh God, inchworms!"
Bart,Won't you get in trouble if your Mom sees you doing that?
Bart,"Wow, you are so lucky."
Bart,"Eh, I don't need one."
Bart,"Yeah, probably."
Bart,"Oh, cool. Can I get a shot now?"
Bart,"Mmm. No, thanks."
Bart,"No way. C'mon, quit hoggin' the gun."
Bart,Are you crazy? I don't wanna shoot a stupid bird.
Bart,Am too.
Bart,"Hey, quit it!"
Bart,Oh my God...
Bart,Crooked sight?
Bart,"But, but I wasn't... I didn't..."
Bart,"Hey, leave it alone."
Bart,Don't call me that!
Bart,"Yes, sir. Because I killed an innocent bird."
Bart,No! Not the face!
Bart,Ow! What are you doing?
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Mom, you were right. Nelson is bad news. Can we go home?"
Bart,Nothing.
Bart,"Uh, cats like me."
Bart,"Get off, get off!"
Bart,"I didn't mean to, Mom. The gun pulled to the left --"
Bart,"I know, I really screwed up. I deserve to be punished."
Bart,"Mom, wait..."
Bart,"Oh, my God."
Bart,"Hi, little eggs. I'm not sure how to tell you this, but... Y-Your mom was involved in an incident. Mistakes were made. By me. But don't worry, I'll take care of you."
Bart,"Hey, fellas, good news. I found an extra 75-watt bulb lyin' around."
Bart,"Check it out, guys. I've been working on this regurgitation thing."
Bart,"Oh, yeah. Hope you like PopTarts."
Bart,"I think I'll call you Chirpy Boy, and you Bart Junior. And you can call me Mother. No, wait, that sounds kinda fruity. Just call me Mom."
Bart,"Oh, no!"
Bart,I've gotta keep these warm.
Bart,Can't right now. Come back later.
Bart,"Mom, listen--"
Bart,"That bird I killed was their mother. I don't want her babies to die, too."
Bart,"Is the nest still warm enough, Mom?"
Bart,Everybody come quick! They're hatching!
Bart,I see a neck!
Bart,"Man, those are some funky-lookin' birds."
Bart,"Sure they are. They came from eggs in a bird's nest. Therefore, they're birds. Ixo fatso."
Bart,You're a lizard.
Bart,Excuse me. Can you tell us what kind of birds these are? They hatched from eggs I found in a nest.
Bart,Wait! What the heck are you doing?!
Bart,Help! Dad's trying to kill me!
Bart,No! Don't hurt them! I'll just keep them as pets.
Bart,Nooo! They're mine.
Bart,"Everyone thinks they're monsters, but I raised them and I love them. I know that's hard to understand."
Bart,Really?
Bart,"Guys, is it really true? Are you cold-blooded egg-murderers?"
Bart,Don't use that look on me. I invented that look.
Bart,Oh no! You killed 'em.
Bart,"Whoa, look at 'em."
Bart,"Go, Chirpy Boy! Go, Bart Junior!"
Bart,"Hey, you're right. I call the front seat!"
Bart,"Thanks a lot, Chief."
Bart,"Phew, that was close."
Bart,Whoa!
Bart,That's Snake's voice!
Bart,"Oh, man!"
Bart,Oh my God! Everyone Snake swore revenge on is being murdered!
Bart,Don't you get it? He swore he'd kill me too. I'm next!
Bart,Dad?
Bart,Nooo!
Bart,My school picture!!
Bart,"You've got to fight the hair, Dad!"
Bart,"I love you too, Dad."
Bart,Get off of me.
Bart,"Ow! That's my face, you idiot!"
Bart,What the--
Bart,"Nah, it's too early. I need to work under cover of darkness."
Bart,There's gotta be some batteries in here somewhere.
Bart,Hmm...
Bart,Don't you ever get tired of being wrong?
Bart,Color's screwed up.
Bart,Whoaaa! Cool!
Bart,"Hey Lis, we're characters in a cartoon!"
Bart,Look!
Bart,A cartoon axe. I love it.
Bart,Help! Police!
Bart,Not if I know cartoons!
Bart,"Not now Lis, I'm trying to relax."
Bart,Itchy's house. This is where we came in.
Bart,"Hurry, Homer!"
Bart,"Oooh, that is gonna hurt tomorrow."
Bart,Oh!
Bart,What's wrong with stinky?
Bart,"Oh, that's disgusting."
Bart,"People, people. Space monsters. This is going nowhere. There's only one man who can settle an argument this bizarre."
Bart,Don't forget Ken Starr.
Bart,So are we going to the lake or what?
Bart,"Well, if we'd left at four A.M. like I wanted to..."
Bart,Whooa!
Bart,"So, I suppose that's a hillbilly Jacuzzi?"
Bart,Check.
Bart,She's down.
Bart,I don't know... I think Dad might be a little heavy for parasailing.
Bart,There goes my turn.
Bart,"We've been looking all over for you, Dad. Where did you land?"
Bart,"Alec Baldwin, wow. That is the coolest person you've ever been fired by. What was it like at their house?"
Bart,Didn't seem like anybody even read the script.
Bart,Fat Guy Number Three?
Bart,"Hey, what the heck is your middle name, anyway?"
Bart,"Uh, so, Dad, regarding that form... why not just make up a middle name?"
Bart,Not to mention hilarious.
Bart,"Oh, please God, don't let them come in here."
Bart,"Aw, cheer up, Dad. You make a great hippie."
Bart,"No, really. You're lazy and self-righteous..."
Bart,"Well, why don't you just pull it out?"
Bart,"I'm starving. Mom, can we go Catholic so we get communion wafers and booze?"
Bart,"Mmm... So you say this product is known as ""fudge?"""
Bart,"If you're gonna get snippy, I'll take my business elsewhere."
Bart,Dad! The fish!
Bart,"Wow, you didn't even feel her forehead. How do I get that kind of credibility?"
Bart,"Meh, it's not worth it."
Bart,"S'up, sis?"
Bart,I am.
Bart,It's a little something I whipped up in shop. Mostly latex. What're you doing out here?
Bart,"Well, if it was me, I'd just take the zero. Ah, but, that's not for everyone. There's one other possibility."
Bart,"Relax, there's nothing here you didn't see when Dad boycotted pants."
Bart,"Miss Hoover, ""Wind in the Willows."""
Bart,"Pardon me for asking, but where the hell's my stupid lobster?"
Bart,What? You gotta be kiddin' me.
Bart,"Aw, cheer up, Lis. You got a good grade without even reading the book. That's win-win."
Bart,"Hmmm... I suppose maybe if, uh... no. No, sorry, thought I had it there for a sec."
Bart,"Okay, Lisa's gone!"
Bart,"Hey, what smells so good?"
Bart,Are you gonna eat that all by yourself?
Bart,This ghost town is gonna be great. Now with 30 percent more gunfights!
Bart,We heard you the first time.
Bart,Wow! Have you ever seen so many robot cowboys?
Bart,All right!
Bart,"Hey, Mom, look what I got."
Bart,"No, that security guard is handing them out."
Bart,He knows what he's doing.
Bart,"Check it out, Dad. I rented all your favorite gorilla movies. ""Gorilla Squadron,"" ""Gorilla Island VI,""..."
Bart,Even I wouldn't do that. And I'm America's Bad Boy.
Bart,"Try not to move, Dad. You swallowed a lot of motor oil."
Bart,"Dad, you're tickling me."
Bart,"Yup, beats school."
Bart,"Hey, wait. I saw that Lost in Space movie. You are not Doctor Smith."
Bart,That swarm of nerds is gonna kill him!
Bart,"Dad, over here!"
Bart,We just want to get a snack.
Bart,"But, Da--"
Bart,"Well, then you start it."
Bart,"Dad, don't you see what's going on?"
Bart,"Hey, my milk! I traded my math book for that!"
Bart,"Aren't you scared, Dad? I mean, if I were Fat Tony, and God willing someday I will be, I'd just be stewing in my jail cell, gettin' madder and madder."
Bart,All right! Here comes the implosion!
Bart,Crap rock?
Bart,"Throw hot wax on him, Dad!"
Bart,Mesquite it is!
Bart,You've never snuck out of church to break into cars?
Bart,"But you've gotta support the team, Dad. They're already threatening to move to Moose Jaw."
Bart,"Mom, am I dying?"
Bart,"No, they lost."
Bart,Yes! Yes! Yes!
Bart,Someone trashed the school!
Bart,The cops can't just slap a curfew on us. We have rights.
Bart,What about adultery?
Bart,"And here we are, locked inside."
Bart,Energy Shortage.
Bart,Can't we just go to bed?
Bart,Yeah. Just look at 'em over there...
Bart,Scratching their big butts...
Bart,You wanna hold it for a while?
Bart,Lis! No! It's prime-time!
Bart,"Oh no, it won't."
Bart,"Milhouse, do you see what's on Channel six?"
Bart,"Milhouse, spread the word! We're seeing this movie -- tonight! That's right, we're breaking curfew!"
Bart,"Oh, that is it. I am tired of being pushed around by grownups! It's time to fight back!"
Bart,She's right! Homer's done a ton of crap that never made the papers.
Bart,No! We have to reach people whose opinions actually matter. And I think I know how. Why don't we...
Bart,"Good evening, adults."
Bart,... we interrupt this broadcast to bring you a very special presentation. Tonight's program is entitled...
Bart,Constable Wiggum likes to act tough. But he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose?
Bart,And Schoolmistress Krabappel has been stealing supplies from the school cafeteria.
Bart,Now we come to Mr. Homer Simpson...
Bart,Did you know he likes to eat out of the Flanders' garbage?
Bart,"Tune in tomorrow, and every day until the curfew is lifted. Because we'll be revealing embarrassing secrets about Springfield's other adults."
Bart,And we have plenty more on Homer Simpson.
Bart,Taped and corked.
Bart,You can't make us come down.
Bart,ADULTS! / YOU RUN OUR LIVES LIKE YOU'RE COLONEL KLINK.
Bart,"Wow, it's ours?"
Bart,Be with ya in a minute...
Bart,A coupon book? What am I gonna do with this piece of junk?
Bart,"Happy Birthday, Dad."
Bart,Yeah. Not a dame in sight.
Bart,"Cool, the NFL's oldest surviving player."
Bart,"Yes, sir!"
Bart,I'm catching a pass from Dan Marino! This is the greatest moment of my...
Bart,"Wait, Dad, look!"
Bart,"Oh, man."
Bart,You got my vote.
Bart,Thank you.
Bart,"Where is it, man?"
Bart,"Hey, look what I found!"
Bart,"Hey, somebody just scored."
Bart,"Dad, that doesn't belong to you."
Bart,This isn't bad.
Bart,Right. Coincidence.
Bart,Okay.
Bart,Now he's stupid and whiny.
Bart,"I love it, Max."
Bart,Isn't that the wrong way?
Bart,"And, thank you, God, for the bad things adults do, which distract attention from stuff I'm doing. Amen."
Bart,"Good save, Mom. 'Night."
Bart,"Uh, Mom?"
Bart,Will you help me with my project? I need to make a working model of the digestive system.
Bart,Thanks! It's due tomorrow.
Bart,"You're right, Mom. I understand."
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Wow, that looks great, Mom. Some of your best work."
Bart,"Nelson, what are you doing?!"
Bart,"Hey, you're wrecking it!"
Bart,"I hope you're happy, Nelson."
Bart,"All right, the Personals! Hmm. Hm-hm-hm. ""Successful mayor-type seeks open-minded, discreet cheerleader-type."""
Bart,"Oh, here's one, ""Desperately Seeking Suction--"""
Bart,"I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks and blows."
Bart,Kill me.
Bart,"Mom, to your left. He's letting you in. Go!"
Bart,Fatal to the people in the other car. Let's roll!
Bart,Uh-oh. Gridlock at twelve o'clock.
Bart,"Um, I don't want to alarm you, but the ice cream's startin' to go south."
Bart,I did not.
Bart,All right.
Bart,"C'mon, Mom, just cut across the field."
Bart,Do you want to spend your whole life doing what's right?
Bart,"Whoooa! You the man, Mom!"
Bart,"Look at me, Lis! I'm Baron von Chicken Pants."
Bart,You're tomorrow night's dinner.
Bart,"Oh, what a gyp. They're all just lying around. Do something!"
Bart,"Look, it's Mom!"
Bart,Wow! You are so much cooler than Milhouse's mom.
Bart,"Why, NBC, of course."
Bart,"Oh, quit complaining. It's half the work of the divorced dad."
Bart,"Hysterical, but I traded my turn to Lisa for her dessert."
Bart,Trade you my next turn for your dessert.
Bart,Who's Fonzie?
Bart,So what's so great about the Bill of Rights?
Bart,I'm gonna make your life a living hell.
Bart,"Okay, if you're gonna live in my room, you're gonna obey my rules. One: I am Bart, thy God. If I Am out, the Krusty doll is thy God. If the doll's with me, you will worship the night light. Should the night light be unable to fulfill its duties..."
Bart,You shut up.
Bart,"No, you shut up."
Bart,Stop what?
Bart,"Hey, that's what I do in my room, 'Lis. I squeak my chair."
Bart,Race ya!
Bart,"Hmmm... Hey, Milhouse. Wanna have some fun?"
Bart,"Oh, Mom, you are a prankster's dream. Wow, you really clobbered him!"
Bart,"Yeah, well, it serves you right for eavesdropping."
Bart,"Well, you told her, Dad."
Bart,Huh?
Bart,I think I read somewhere that cows like being killed.
Bart,Cool. Even this menu is made of meat. It's an entire chicken pounded flat.
Bart,"It's an insult. Sock him, Dad. Sock everybody."
Bart,Go Dad!
Bart,Go! Go! Go!
Bart,"Come on, Dad, pick up the pace. Chew and swallow, no savoring."
Bart,"Come on, Dad, just twelve more pounds."
Bart,"Oh, lemme go with you, Dad!"
Bart,Don't you have work?
Bart,"Well, you're not really a trucker now."
Bart,"Well, according to Red's schedule, we have to make it to Atlanta in three days."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,I suppose.
Bart,"Uh-huh. Bet he used bait, too."
Bart,"Actually, we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours."
Bart,"Dad, no!"
Bart,"Wow, you're right, Dad. It is windy."
Bart,He hit us!
Bart,"Dad, they're trying to kill us!"
Bart,"Whoa, look at him roll."
Bart,"Dad, stop!"
Bart,What are you doing?
Bart,Huh?
Bart,"Oh, yeah."
Bart,"Dad, do something!"
Bart,Something better!
Bart,"Yep. You're gonna make it, Dad. And somewhere up there, I bet Red is saying thanks."
Bart,Any thoughts on how we're gonna get there?
Bart,Even that praying mantis is losin' it.
Bart,"Man, captivity blows."
Bart,No! The bush set me up!
Bart,How am I supposed to get up there?
Bart,Oy carumba!
Bart,Whoa-ho-ho!
Bart,"Ohh, Dad, you're sitting on my arm."
Bart,I'm bored. Send in my jester.
Bart,What else you got?
Bart,"Methuselah, my oldest friend. Who did this to you?"
Bart,But Goliath is dead. I smote him myself. I smoted him good.
Bart,Nooo... Goliath Two is gonna pay. And this time it's biblical.
Bart,"I'll just give Goliath Two the ol' rock to the head, applause applause, ""ya gotta believe in yourself, stay in school,"" and we're outta here."
Bart,"Quiet, you."
Bart,You killed my best friend.
Bart,All I need is my trusty sling and one good hard...
Bart,"Say, how's tomorrow for you?"
Bart,"What say you now, Goliath? Without your precious hair, you no longer possess your fantastic strength!"
Bart,I hope this doesn't get into the Bible.
Bart,"Well, get yourself another hero, kid. I'm all washed up."
Bart,Goliath Two is really gonna pay. Get ready to meet the first action hero.
Bart,All right. It's giant slayin' time...
Bart,Oops.
Bart,Crap.
Bart,Jonah! You died the way you lived - inside a whale.
Bart,Hmm...
Bart,Don't you know smoking stunts your growth?
Bart,"I'm not afraid of you, Goliath. Before I was arrogant. But now, my heart is humble, and my spirit is..."
Bart,Hope I don't give you heartburn!
Bart,"Great news, everyone. Goliath is dead! Although I haven't seen his body, the blast that failed to kill me, surely killed the giant. Anyhoo, now that I'm your king again..."
Bart,Ralph! I thought you were dead!
Bart,"Rejoice, good people. Goliath the Terrible shall rule no more!"
Bart,Whuh?
Bart,Not anymore.
Bart,"You're ""Pop""? No offense, but even I could kick your ass."
Bart,Can I burn evidence in it?
Bart,I think he's almost done.
Bart,"Yeah, he's done."
Bart,Sounds like somebody's jealous.
Bart,"Well, I'm flunkin' math, and the other day I was a little attracted to Milhouse."
Bart,"Hit the road, ""Welcome Home."""
Bart,"See you in hell, ""God Bless This House."""
Bart,"It wasn't easy, but I got all the grizzlies."
Bart,"Are you sure this is art, not vandalism?"
Bart,Thank you! Thank you!
Bart,"Yeah, go for the gold, Dad!"
Bart,How'd you get the eyes to move?
Bart,"Those aren't the dog's eyes, are they?"
Bart,Ow!!
Bart,"So, uh, you're from Russia, huh?"
Bart,You drunk yet?
Bart,"Poland, eh? Ha. Too easy. How you doin', Germany? Here's my impression of an East German woman, ""Kiss me or I'll crush you."""
Bart,"Hey, Swiss Miss. There's no missin' you, babe. Heh, heh. Lay off the cocoa."
Bart,"Now I'd like to say one last thing to our Olympic representatives: if there was a medal for horrible audiences, you'd get the gold. Peace out."
Bart,"Hey, Chalmers, where are you from?"
Bart,What are you gonna do to me?
Bart,"The Fireworks, Candy and Puppy Dog Store?!"
Bart,Ewwww.
Bart,Okay. Just breathe through your mouth and don't ask how they're feeling.
Bart,"Oh, man..."
Bart,Yahhh!
Bart,"Phew, saved by the bell."
Bart,Whoa!
Bart,"Oh no, Lis! They got you, too?"
Bart,That's the prize?! A banana?
Bart,"They're not babies, Lisa. Give 'em something fun, like cigars or booze."
Bart,You tell them when to sleep?
Bart,"Cool. Grampa, Homer. Grampa, Homer."
Bart,That place sucks! The nurses don't let Grampa do anything. They practically chew his food for him.
Bart,They cut out the best word!
Bart,"Say, I hear a foghorn. BOR-ING..."
Bart,Oh no! Pirates!
Bart,"Ahoy mateys, it's me, Long Bart Silver and I'm gonna rip you a new I.V. hole."
Bart,I'm just trying to liven things up around here. These people need to ride motorcycles and play rockin' electric guitars like the old people on TV.
Bart,"Okay, she's gone. Let's break out of here and have some fun!"
Bart,"What about you, Chief? Don't you want to be free like the eagle?"
Bart,"Come on, people. You don't want to stay in a place where they vacuum you while you sleep."
Bart,Now's our chance. Let's go!
Bart,"Hey, everybody!"
Bart,How'd you like to go on a real boat trip?
Bart,Full speed ahead! Damn the torpedoes!
Bart,"Aw, geez, this place used to be crawling with Russian subs. Now there's just four."
Bart,Sea hag!
Bart,No way! They're finally having some fun!
Bart,"But I've set you free. No more nap time, no more bingo. You can do whatever you want!"
Bart,"I don't get it, Grampa. If you guys like all that boring stuff, why did you follow me out here?"
Bart,"Oh, it's not fair. I'm not supposed to die now. I'm supposed to die in a foolish motorcycle stunt at the age of fifteen."
Bart,"Well, I finished my community service."
Bart,But I could swing by after school. I'll bring the limbo stick.
Bart,"Hey, stop shaking the harness."
Bart,"I'm not lazy, I'm just um, uhh... Lisa, finish my sentence for me."
Bart,"Hi-yo Silver, away!"
Bart,"If you love me, you'll kill me."
Bart,Whoa! This place has everything! Even a shoplifting department.
Bart,"Hey, Dad, gimme fifty bucks. I gotta buy some things. Uh, better make it a hundred."
Bart,Cool!
Bart,"Oh, get with the times, man. It's Jerry Rude and the Bathroom Bunch."
Bart,"Ladles and jellyspoons, I will now take going low to new heights. I will swallow anything -- and I mean anything -- you people throw."
Bart,"Please, no more spark plugs."
Bart,Yee-ha!
Bart,Hey Lis.
Bart,Whoa! Whoa!
Bart,Dad? Dad? Are you home?
Bart,Fine. I don't care what you're doin'.
Bart,I know a web site that shows monkeys doin' it.
Bart,"My name is Mary. I'm 45, heavy and willing to settle for less."
Bart,How 'bout here?
Bart,"Look Mom, they have your dress."
Bart,"Come on, Transylvania."
Bart,You're the waitress.
Bart,"Mom, Lis! Check it out. Dad's on TV."
Bart,"Hey, I'm still checkin' out Japanese TV."
Bart,Isn't this that cartoon that causes seizures?
Bart,And?
Bart,These prices suck! Ten thousand yen for coleslaw?!
Bart,"Hey, look. Isn't that Woody Allen?"
Bart,Says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring.
Bart,"Then we had to do two hours of origami, followed by flower arranging and meditation."
Bart,And I think I've finally found what I was put on this earth to do...
Bart,"Knife goes in, guts come out. Knife goes in, guts come out..."
Bart,"Knife goes in, guts come out."
Bart,I had an inkling.
Bart,"Sure thing, Dad."
Bart,This vacation really blows.
Bart,U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S...
Bart,Plane tickets!
Bart,"Goodbye, Japan. I'll miss your Kentucky Fried Chicken and your sparkling, whale-free seas."
Bart,You betcha.
Bart,"Pound him, Dad!"
Bart,"Quiet! Dad's gonna get his butt kicked by Mel Gibson! Knock his teeth out, Homer!"
Bart,I don't see any cameras.
Bart,"Can I stay with you, Dad?"
Bart,"Wow, these dummies look pretty good."
Bart,"Mom, you've gotta take my picture in this car so I can show Milhouse!"
Bart,What's that stuff?
Bart,It sure is!
Bart,And what's that?
Bart,You need one.
Bart,What's this?
Bart,"LOOK, A FIRE!..."
Bart,... engine.
Bart,HELP! HELP! FIRE!... ... helmets.
Bart,"Sure, I can do something destructive!"
Bart,Can't help ya.
Bart,Yeee-hawww!
Bart,"Yeah, it all kinda came together."
Bart,"Gimme an ""F!"""
Bart,"Gimme an ""art!"""
Bart,Ow! Knock it off!
Bart,Medication?
Bart,I don't want to take drugs.
Bart,He's just flamboyant.
Bart,"Dad, I admit I have some problems, but drugs aren't the answer."
Bart,"Nice try, Homer."
Bart,Really?
Bart,"Oh, Mom..."
Bart,All right. I'll do it for you.
Bart,I'm having some side effects from the dope.
Bart,All I know is my testicles won't fit in my underwear.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,I have to take these stupid pills twice a day.
Bart,"Claritin ""D""?"
Bart,I'll do it.
Bart,What?
Bart,"Well, it's not like I never saw a dog before."
Bart,"C'mon, people. This poetry isn't gonna appreciate itself."
Bart,I'm reading.
Bart,"Joke if you will, but did you know most people use ten percent of their brains? I am now one of them. Before, my energy was all over the place. Now it's concentrated like a laser beam."
Bart,"Well, this has been terrific. Let's do it again sometime."
Bart,It's from the book.
Bart,Memo to self: Lock door.
Bart,"Memo to self: Shut up, Lisa."
Bart,Cost of paper? Five cents. A mother's love? Priceless.
Bart,"No, but here's a book called ""Chicken Soup for the Loser"" that gave Bill Buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats."
Bart,"I think it's the bright blue pants. I mean, you're not on a golf course."
Bart,And why did Humpty Dumpty have a great fall?
Bart,"That's right. You stay on the ball, you stay on the wall."
Bart,Gotta get it done.
Bart,Gotta finish.
Bart,Close the door!
Bart,You're probably wondering about the coat hangers. They're to block the satellite that's been spying on me.
Bart,It can read your electronic organizer from space.
Bart,They have it now.
Bart,Who else? Major League Baseball.
Bart,"Nothing yet. But the time draws near. Now, let's get those fillings out of you."
Bart,No! You can't take my Focusyn! I need every brain cell blazing to outwit my invisible enemies!
Bart,No!
Bart,Don't stop / Thinkin' about tomorrow! / Don't stop / It'll soon be here...
Bart,Wow. Praise from Caesar.
Bart,"Hey, Mom. Thanks for comin' out."
Bart,It ran outta gas.
Bart,Question.
Bart,Okay. Sure.
Bart,Right after I blow up one thing.
Bart,I told you they were monitoring my activities.
Bart,"But why, Mr. McGwire?"
Bart,"Hey, at least I got to see some cool colors."
Bart,You said a mouthful!
Bart,"When I can't stop fiddlin' / I just takes me Ritalin / I'm poppin' and sailin', man!"
Bart,"Come to think of it, I haven't seen Uter since the last field trip."
Bart,"Well, that's great, Dad, except you were supposed to drive us to the newspaper."
Bart,"Check it out, Dad. You can print out the headline from the day you were born."
Bart,"Oh, that's nothin'. He can hear pudding."
Bart,"Yeah, now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt, we'll be on easy street."
Bart,And there's that awful script from The Cable Guy!
Bart,"Wait a minute, they're gonna kill Dad!"
Bart,"... So if we don't find Dad, this crazy French guy is gonna kill him!"
Bart,Ned Flanders!
Bart,You mean you killed Ned Flanders.
Bart,They'll never believe a Simpson killed a Flanders by accident. Even I have my doubts.
Bart,But who?
Bart,Are you a zombie?
Bart,Cool...
Bart,"Whoa, Lis, those X-rays must've given you super strength. I wonder if I got any powers..."
Bart,"Nope, looks normal... Wait a minute."
Bart,I can stretch!
Bart,Look at me!
Bart,Ow! Hot-hot-hot!
Bart,I must only use this power to annoy.
Bart,Gotcha.
Bart,Clobber Girl?
Bart,It's Xena! She's been kidnapped! Come on!
Bart,"I don't think so, either."
Bart,Just a sec.
Bart,"Whoa! Hey, phaser, phaser, phaser -- zing!"
Bart,What d'you think I've been tryin' to do?
Bart,"Wow, thanks for saving us."
Bart,"Oh, no! Krusty!"
Bart,"Krus-tyyyyyy! Hey, a note."
Bart,You have been selected for Operation Exodus...
Bart,There it is!
Bart,"Wow, there's Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, Paul McCartney, Michael Jordan, Michelle Kwan..."
Bart,"Hey, look, another spaceship!"
Bart,Are you still talking about the Earth?
Bart,Wait a minute. They're not so great.
Bart,Wait. Only that ship is going to Mars. Our's is headed for the sun.
Bart,"Don't worry, Dad. We'll be dead in five minutes."
Bart,It's a history lesson come to life.
Bart,"Quiet, here come the Ninjas."
Bart,She's lying! Slice her head off!
Bart,"Yeah, he's probably just a big blowhard like you."
Bart,"Well, it's worth a try don't you--"
Bart,We can't go back home?
Bart,You mean Grampa's old farm?
Bart,What a dump!
Bart,I'll dig an outhouse.
Bart,It doesn't sound very tractor-y.
Bart,Dad!
Bart,Lassie?
Bart,"Wow, Dad, this is the juiciest watermelon I ever tasted."
Bart,What are you planting?
Bart,Paw!
Bart,"Dad, if we leave for town right now, we can catch the dinner special at Krusty-Burger."
Bart,Wasn't skipping town in the first place a coward's way out?
Bart,"Let 'im go, Mom."
Bart,Bleh! Tastes like cigarette butts.
Bart,Gimme! I want more!
Bart,It does. But it's smooth and mild. And refreshingly addictive.
Bart,Have your cash or food stamps ready!
Bart,"She's right, Dad. They can afford a lot more."
Bart,"You okay, Dad?"
Bart,"No need, Dad. Over the years I've learned to find father figures wherever I can... construction workers, the internet... and Nelson, here."
Bart,Cool costume!
Bart,I'll say. I learned the true meaning of Columbus Day.
Bart,And then I learned the true meaning of winter.
Bart,"Gee, sorry for being born."
Bart,I can't believe we're gonna see the octuplets.
Bart,"Yeah, but now their umbilical cords have fallen off!"
Bart,"Boo, Baron!"
Bart,"Some are real, some are just robots filled with venom."
Bart,Why don't we eat there tonight?!
Bart,Dennis the Menace?
Bart,Uh-huh.
Bart,I have to go.
Bart,"Man, you're bending the hell out of that kick-stand, Dad. Why don't you just take it for a ride?"
Bart,"Yeah, I promise."
Bart,You're kidding?
Bart,You don't know how.
Bart,Of course.
Bart,"Later, Homer."
Bart,Hey! Hey! That's a leave-in conditioner!
Bart,"Way to go Dad. Hey, where's the food?"
Bart,"Hm. ""Thanks for letting us crash in your pad. We had a very nice time."""
Bart,P.S. We've taken your old lady.
Bart,"Oh, I am so bored."
Bart,Woo! Springfield rocks!
Bart,"All right, Silly String!"
Bart,"Look, you're Milhouse."
Bart,There's gotta be something fun in my parents' closet.
Bart,"Uh, wouldn't that make us kinda... fruity?"
Bart,"I'll show you who's scared. Oh, wow, this really hides my thighs."
Bart,"Oh, no! It's Dad!"
Bart,Do all these people have to watch me?
Bart,"Uhh, little help?"
Bart,Don't need it anymore. Doctor says my butt-bone's stronger than ever.
Bart,Tah dah!
Bart,"I can't take Mr. Burns to the ho'pital 'cause I'm too dumb to read a map. Oh, why did my school have to close?"
Bart,Daytime TV is muy estupido.
Bart,"Hey, our school's on TV."
Bart,Boogers.
Bart,You're not mad?
Bart,Check it out. I'm breaking books at a sixth-grade level.
Bart,You know what our homework is? Find a toy and bring it to class!
Bart,"I know, but I'm still not gonna do it."
Bart,Yeah. With lots of firepower!
Bart,Lisa in trouble. Ha! The ironing is delicious.
Bart,Huh?
Bart,"Alls I know is I'm gettin' straight ""A's"". And that ain't not bad."
Bart,"Ah, three it is."
Bart,Mom! I know what I want for Christmas.
Bart,"Thanks, Funzo. You rock!"
Bart,"No, but if you're gonna throw a spaz, I'll come with."
Bart,"Hey, it's Gary Coleman."
Bart,I want to see how this turns out.
Bart,Let's just say he's a few prawns short of a galaxy.
Bart,Deal!
Bart,"And I want Funzo's dream fortress, Funzo's lower-back-pain chair, Funzo's European voltage converter..."
Bart,It's always a party with Funzo!
Bart,Yeah. Funzo makes playtime fun!
Bart,Hey! Why is it destroying other toys?
Bart,You mean like Microsoft?
Bart,Unless...
Bart,Thus saving Christmas.
Bart,Peace out!
Bart,"Just dump 'em in the fire, Dad."
Bart,"Hey, don't talk to my sister that way."
Bart,"Well, there's something you don't see every Christmas."
Bart,"Hey, Dad... What if we..."
Bart,Cloning is a troubling issue.
Bart,Are you sure? You sound nervous.
Bart,It's the Goodwill truck!
Bart,"Look, here's the box for my Pitchback. If I still had it, I could put it in here."
Bart,"Yeah! Let's go skiing! / Yeah, Dad. Let's go!"
Bart,"Look Dad, it's the drummer from Bread!"
Bart,"Some gentle rocking will relax you, Mom."
Bart,Um... I gotta blast a dookie.
Bart,Stomp that pickle revert!
Bart,Can I go to the bathroom?
Bart,"And don't worry, all the laundry and dirty dishes'll be there when you get back."
Bart,I'll supervise.
Bart,It unraveled on a nail.
Bart,"You're dead, squealer."
Bart,They need to soak.
Bart,It's an illusion.
Bart,I didn't know Aerosmith made a cereal.
Bart,Polo!
Bart,Polo!
Bart,Polo!
Bart,My skin! My beautiful skin!
Bart,Shut up! Shut up!
Bart,Duh! We're pigs!
Bart,Leprosy?!
Bart,Aahhh! Unclean! Unclean!
Bart,"Why would God punish a kid? I mean, an American kid?"
Bart,At Sunday School they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude.
Bart,"Yeah, that sounds right."
Bart,/ Help us. / We're diseased.
Bart,Brains... Brains...
Bart,"All right, food!"
Bart,Whoa! This is a hospital?
Bart,Can we get a room with a view?
Bart,Glad that's not me.
Bart,Time to turn over.
Bart,"Yeah, we know."
Bart,No way. We scored a free Hawaiian vacation.
Bart,"Tonight we're gonna put our fake sores back on, then jump the fence at Club Med, and scare the normals."
Bart,"Sorry, Dad, it just won't budge."
Bart,"Okay. Hang on, Homer. Two eye holes coming up!"
Bart,Brother Faith's Revival?
Bart,Wow! He dances better than Jesus Himself!
Bart,That was a miracle and it was gross. Cool.
Bart,Wow! Is there anything he can't do?
Bart,I have the power?
Bart,I have the power!
Bart,"'Scuse me, Brother Faith. I gotta know, how did you really get the bucket off my Dad's head?"
Bart,Really? Hm. I would think He would want to limit my power.
Bart,I figure I'll go for the life of sin followed by the presto-chango deathbed repentance.
Bart,Full coverage... hmm...
Bart,"... then I said ""I have the power"" and the bucket came off!"
Bart,"I'll give it a whirl, Ralphie boy."
Bart,Devil be gone!
Bart,Number of miracles performed by Bart: two. Number performed by Lisa: zero.
Bart,Heat makes metal expand? Now who's talkin' mumbo-jumbo?
Bart,I got two words for this sermon:
Bart,"Well, to be honest, yes."
Bart,But church can be fun.
Bart,"No, really. It can be a crazy party, with clouds and lasers and miracles."
Bart,A real preacher knows how to bring the Bible alive through music and dancing and Tae-Bo!
Bart,"Three, two, one, pull!"
Bart,Hm. Maybe we should air it out a little.
Bart,"Satan, eat my shorts!!"
Bart,"I WAS A SINNER, A REAL BAD KID / WHAT THOU SHALT NOT, I SHALT DID / NEIGHBOR'S CAT I TRIED TO NEUTER / TOOK A WHIZ ON THE SCHOOL COMPUTER."
Bart,BUT NOW I'VE CHANGED / YOU CAN'T DE-NY / COME ON UP AND / TES-TI-FY!
Bart,TES-TI-FY! / TES-TI-FY!
Bart,Now you'll get the girls you seek!
Bart,TES-TI-FY!!!
Bart,"Song's over, Milhouse. But you're welcome."
Bart,Milhouse!
Bart,"Oh, Milhouse, this is my fault. I'm so sorry."
Bart,"Well, I don't think I can."
Bart,"Okay, I'll see what I can do."
Bart,Heal. Heal...
Bart,"Milhouse, I can't help you. I am no healer."
Bart,"Okay, Lis. If they don't have tabouleh, what's your second choice?"
Bart,"Nah, I don't do that anymore."
Bart,Wow. And I thought he had it all.
Bart,"Sorry, Dad. I can't just magically cure a broken leg."
Bart,"Okay, God. If you did give me a power, let it work now. Not just for me, but for my Dad."
Bart,Heal... Heal... Heal...
Bart,Why won't anybody listen to me? I don't have any special powers! I am not a healer!
Bart,I'm Al Unser Jr.!
Bart,"Man, this is livin'."
Bart,"Wow, you can do anything out here."
Bart,"Hey, Coast Guard! Try and stop us now, you lousy Americans!"
Bart,Nice try. You're not gonna nail us!
Bart,"Oh, really? Then play some rock music."
Bart,What about the people on the bottom?
Bart,"Nah, it's not so bad. Here we can spit on the floor."
Bart,Who are those pleasant old men?
Bart,"Check out Lisa. She's a sax machine! Makes me think I should've done something with my life. Oh, well."
Bart,"Way to blow, Lis!"
Bart,Zing!
Bart,You can't do that to Duncan. It's not his fault that his owner was a sleaze.
Bart,He's a diving horse. Maybe he could dive for pearls.
Bart,"Hey, Dad."
Bart,This horse is pretty fast. Maybe we can race him.
Bart,"Dad, if we're gonna race Duncan, shouldn't we hire a professional trainer?"
Bart,"Don't worry, boy. I'll love you even if you don't win."
Bart,"C'mon, boy. I know you're scared, but you can do this. I believe in you!"
Bart,"Duncan's really fast, Dad. He was just intimidated by those other horses."
Bart,"He's the bad boy of racing. He's got attitude and bad-itude, so show him some latitude and you'll win his gratitude. Only in America!"
Bart,Get bent.
Bart,"Don't listen to 'em, D. Just remember, you've got a new persona. A new per-so-na."
Bart,"That's it, D. Don't let anyone push you around. Be as bad as you wanna be."
Bart,You want me to lose the Springfield Derby? But you always taught me that winning was everything.
Bart,"Maybe. But if Duncan wins the Derby, he can spend the rest of his days as a stud."
Bart,Huh?
Bart,"Oh my God, it's a racetrack!"
Bart,"Cool! Way to adapt, little guy."
Bart,"Mr. Babcock, can I take a ride in your car?"
Bart,Shouldn't you be keeping your hands on the wheel?
Bart,Whoa!
Bart,"Boy, these cars are surprisingly roomy."
Bart,Move your damn butt.
Bart,C'mon! Somebody crash!
Bart,"Oh, man. Why does everything bad have to happen to me?"
Bart,"When I'm feeling low, you know what always cheers me up?"
Bart,"Oo, tough room. Video games. Whaddaya got? ""Billy Graham's Bible Blaster""?!"
Bart,Got 'im!
Bart,All right! Full Conversion! Thanks guys. This really cheered me up.
Bart,You are playing. We're a team.
Bart,"Why are you taping Flanders, Dad?"
Bart,Do you even have a job anymore?
Bart,Got it.
Bart,Aah!
Bart,You're watching PBS?!
Bart,Do Shut Up?
Bart,Cheeky.
Bart,Here come the cricket bats.
Bart,Pledge drive?
Bart,"Dad, you don't have ten thousand dollars."
Bart,"He's dead, isn't he?"
Bart,"I miss you, Dad. Mom won't let me read ""Hagar the Horrible."""
Bart,"Dad, are you licking toads?"
Bart,"Well, time to get to work."
Bart,But I'm not Homer Simpson...
Bart,"Yeah, but..."
Bart,But...
Bart,Can it wait? I just got off work!
Bart,Don't you do enough yakkin' at the beauty parlor?
Bart,"You're right, I'm sorry. Tell you what: Saturday night we'll go out for steaks, just you and me."
Bart,Wouldn't be the first time.
Bart,You don't know me.
Bart,"Yeah, right, Mom. Then I'd like a rattle and a wowwipop. Actually, I would like a wowwipop."
Bart,Look at her. Must be great to be a baby and be so easily amused.
Bart,"Oh, no!"
Bart,"Okay, don't panic! I'll get the bikes."
Bart,"Oh, man. That would be so awesome!"
Bart,We've got to get closer!
Bart,"I'm not ridin' a girls bike. Hey, it's gettin' away! Step on it! Ya! Ya!"
Bart,Ya!
Bart,"Nice suit, Jeeves!"
Bart,What's Dad doing on the show?
Bart,"Hey, an Indian casino!"
Bart,"Yeah, but I really wanna..."
Bart,I gotta get in that casino.
Bart,"All right! Time for some underage gambling. So long, sucker!"
Bart,Eep.
Bart,I wasn't gonna gamble. I just wanted a Bloody Mary.
Bart,How'd you know my name?
Bart,Oh. I thought maybe you were some kind of Indian mystic who could tell the future.
Bart,Whoa!
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Hey, I bought it from a guy on your reservation."
Bart,"No, it's true."
Bart,"Ew, that's me in the future?"
Bart,"Check, check. Hello, Capital City!"
Bart,"Way to make a guitar, Sears."
Bart,Nah. Use this.
Bart,"Dude, you know I'm good for it. I'll have plenty of money when my lawsuit pays off."
Bart,Or the incident with the over-salted fries...
Bart,Yes!
Bart,"I can't believe ""smell ya later"" replaced ""goodbye."""
Bart,All right! We've got our first gig!
Bart,No prob. I'll just mooch some green off my folks.
Bart,Nonhover.
Bart,"Yo, it's me."
Bart,Don't you mean present?
Bart,"Hey, Dad. My band finally got a break. I just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock. How about a little loanski?"
Bart,I am so sick of hearing about Lisa. Just because she's doing a little better than me...
Bart,"President-Elect. I could've been President, but I'm too real. People can't deal with what I'm layin' down. They're just like, ""Whoa, dude, you can't say that."" And I'm like, ""Watch me."""
Bart,But I want some.
Bart,"What happened to you, man? You used to be cool."
Bart,"Nah, you've changed, man."
Bart,Flanders is a soft touch. He'll give us the money for sure.
Bart,"Listen, dude..."
Bart,"Dude, you got me all wrong..."
Bart,My little one.
Bart,"Then please, help me help myself."
Bart,"Hey, y'all ready to party?"
Bart,"Now, we'd like to play a Jimmy Buffet song, but he un-coolly charges people to cover them. So here's a Cap'n Bart original. WASTED ONCE MORE IN DAQUIRITAVILLE..."
Bart,"Oh, no. I've got half a beer in there! And ""Bewitched"" is on!"
Bart,He's right. I'm a loser. There's only one way out of this mess.
Bart,Damn! I was so close! I had 3-2-7.
Bart,"Well, I'm the President's no-good brother. ""Moochie-moochie."""
Bart,Lisa's the President? I'm a pathetic loser? I gotta be honest: I'm not loving this vision.
Bart,Fifteen-ninety-six...
Bart,Fifteen-ninety-eight...
Bart,Sixteen hundred. Sweet...
Bart,"Quick, Lisa! Call off your..."
Bart,Ow! Watch the ponytail!
Bart,"I knew you'd need some help keepin' it real, so I figured I could be, like, your co-President."
Bart,"Mo-om, Lisa won't share."
Bart,Bewitched marathon.
Bart,"Yeah, I sent it to pick up Ralph. No one was using it."
Bart,"You've changed, Lisa. You used to be cool."
Bart,Heads!
Bart,"Hey, you guys owe me a frisbee. A new one."
Bart,"Relax, Lis. You'll live longer."
Bart,I'm gonna!
Bart,"Yeah, but they said I wouldn't get my first check for two weeks! Meanwhile, they're making major interest on my salary. Hey, maybe I can sue 'em."
Bart,"Hey, Lis. I need a favor."
Bart,I hear ya. All I want you to do is play my demo tape in the background while you're yakkin' about whatever.
Bart,"Now, this ""PLAY"" button's a little screwed up, so you gotta hold it down."
Bart,What? You told me I should do something with my life.
Bart,Mom!
Bart,IF YOU LIKE REFUND ADJUSTMENTS / AND THE MUSIC I PLAY / SEND A CHECK TO MY FRIEND RALPH / AND HE'LL MAIL YOU A TAPE...
Bart,"Hey Lis, my music is going to make it a lot easier for America to swallow your big tax hike."
Bart,DAYLIGHT COME AND YOU WANT-A MY TAPE.
Bart,POST OFFICE BOX 3-0-4-5-2...
Bart,Help! Secret Service!
Bart,"All right, which one of you suits ran over my moped? I just put a dollar's worth of gas in that thing."
Bart,You had a meeting this morning.
Bart,Of what? The United States of Dorksylvania?
Bart,"Don't leave me hangin', Greenspan."
Bart,Thank you. Down low.
Bart,Too slow!
Bart,Wow. You're really asking for my help?
Bart,"Well, if my country needs me... Can we skinny-dip?"
Bart,Settle down. I invited you guys here to help me with this report. Any ideas?
Bart,"Come on, people. We've got to buckle down here. When we're finished, we can go through Bill Clinton's porno stash..."
Bart,Lisa's counting on me for this coolness report.
Bart,Billy Carter's ghost?!
Bart,You mean Lisa wanted to get rid of me?
Bart,I guess I am an embarrassment.
Bart,You put an ad in my vision?
Bart,You guys should relax. You'll live longer.
Bart,You're meeting with debt collectors and you don't want my help? Do you know how crazy that is?
Bart,"Guys, the thing is, we totally have the money. And we tried to wire it to you, but you know how banks screw up."
Bart,We tried to call you all day Saturday...
Bart,"Dude, I know. And I left a message with some guy named Hans."
Bart,He might have been a temp. Very surly.
Bart,"What happened to you, China? You used to be cool."
Bart,"Solid. The rest of you, go on home and look in your mailboxes. 'Cause I totally remember sending checks out."
Bart,Legalize it.
Bart,Tasty. That calls for some tuneskis.
Bart,"Oh, great. Anyone have a paper clip?"
Bart,Why did a vision of my future include a story about Homer and Lincoln's gold?
Bart,I'll do my best.
Bart,"Hey, this is expired!"
Bart,"You're not gonna believe it, Lis! This cool Indian guy showed me our future!"
Bart,I'll say! I've got my own band! And a Moped.
Bart,"Eh, some government job."
Bart,I can't believe it only comes fifty-two times a year.
Bart,"Looks like Milhouse's mom finally threw out his ""blanky."""
Bart,He'll pay a lot to get this back.
Bart,"Dad, that's a sports bra."
Bart,"Look, Dad. Barber hair."
Bart,"Ooo, Italian."
Bart,"Okay, Mom. We're rolling."
Bart,Gaga. Cute name.
Bart,You think we should enter?
Bart,It's gotta be here somewhere.
Bart,"Hey, here's a camera."
Bart,"Man, these old cameras are really built solid."
Bart,Win the what now?
Bart,"Lisa, people these days don't want to see a baby bird. They want to see celebrities at their worst."
Bart,Check out the gut!
Bart,"Hey, why don't we dump spaghetti on Maggie's head?"
Bart,Picture?
Bart,The Play-Doh Factory...
Bart,"C'mon, Springfield. Sparkle for me, baby. That's it..."
Bart,Heads up.
Bart,I said heads up.
Bart,We should be safe up here. I'm pretty sure fires can't climb trees.
Bart,Dad!
Bart,"You did it, Dad!"
Bart,"Now, there's a picture."
Bart,We'll be the laughingstock of the whole town!
Bart,"Here's the mail, Dad. That'll be three dollars for on-couch delivery."
Bart,This isn't real money. It's printed by the Montana Militia.
Bart,I'm betting it's hunger and rage.
Bart,"Hey, what's all the screaming?"
Bart,Mom! Lisa's growing!
Bart,Do you have any hobo chunks we can throw to him?
Bart,"Dad, look out!"
Bart,THE GI-ANT GATOR!
Bart,Sorry. I just want to be a broom boy so bad.
Bart,I'm gettin' used to this country life. Teacher says I'm whittling at a tenth-grade level.
Bart,Yuk!
Bart,"Hey, wake up! We're moving."
Bart,Flavor's gone.
Bart,I've always wanted to see Mount Rushmore.
Bart,Oh.
Bart,"I hate shopping. Just get me a deck of cards, and I'll win whatever I need from the other kids."
Bart,"I'm in tantrum position. T-minus five... four... three... remembering dead cat for real tears, and..."
Bart,Tantrum averted. But now I can't forget the cat.
Bart,Dad!
Bart,War Heads? Jelly Bellies? We're like two kids in a candy store!
Bart,"Yes sir, this is gonna be the best week of our young lives."
Bart,What'd we do?
Bart,Now where do we go?
Bart,Wait a minute. Everybody thinks we're at camp this week. We can stay wherever we want.
Bart,I've got a better place.
Bart,Yeah. It's just like my dad always says...
Bart,"This is way better than camp. No mosquitoes, no stupid camp songs..."
Bart,Quick. Up here.
Bart,Quiet. Just keep scurrying.
Bart,"Gold! Wait, this is just chocolate. Chocolate!"
Bart,Flavor's gone.
Bart,Ow! No golf shoes!
Bart,"Ready, Milhouse?"
Bart,We're lumberjacks!
Bart,Perfect.
Bart,Can you see the lion anywhere?
Bart,"Well, do you see him or not?"
Bart,Are you saying he's right on the other side of that plant?
Bart,Okay. Run!!!
Bart,This way!
Bart,"You okay, Milhouse?"
Bart,"Tonight, on the Discovery Channel: ""Inside Lisa's Nose."""
Bart,What will we find? Boogers... or Nazi gold?
Bart,No way.
Bart,Cut! Cut! Cut!
Bart,"Otto, a red traffic light means what?"
Bart,"Otto, since when have you had a girlfriend?"
Bart,I told Otto he could have the wedding here. Hope that's okay.
Bart,"Hey, it'll be easy. You've still got most of the stuff from Apu's wedding back there."
Bart,Why am I just learning this now?
Bart,"So, any words for the bride and groom?"
Bart,You don't seem to be trying very hard.
Bart,"Hey, why don't you stay with us?"
Bart,"A man innocently changes his oil, when... a two-ton car comes crashing down!"
Bart,Crashing down!
Bart,Who'd have thought you could hold up a car with a wicker basket?
Bart,"Mom, this gravy tastes better than God's sweat."
Bart,"Yeah, Mom. I need something great. Milhouse has footage of himself falling down the stairs."
Bart,"Relax, he's gorging."
Bart,"Okay, maybe not."
Bart,Kills again? She hasn't killed once!
Bart,Too soon.
Bart,"The kids are saying if you say Bloody Margie five times, she'll appear. But then she gouges your eyes out."
Bart,Cut! Cut!
Bart,"Mom, it's great to have you back, but you walked right into my shot."
Bart,Mom!
Bart,The cops found me driving on the sidewalk.
Bart,Home Improvement...
Bart,TV families were always hugging and tackling issues.
Bart,Simp-son!!! Where's my dinner?!
Bart,"I first knew the show was a hit when I walked into school, and a kid was wearing a Bart Simpson T-shirt."
Bart,"Fox had an endless supply of clever slogans, man."
Bart,The funniest stuff came right out of real life.
Bart,"Cowabunga, dude!"
Bart,"Dad, I've never said ""Cowabunga!"" in my life. Your script sucks."
Bart,We found a secret room that was filled to the ceiling with parachute pants. I'm wearing some now.
Bart,"The script originally called for me to jump the gorge. But I'd been up all night paying people to kiss, so Dad volunteered to do the stunt."
Bart,"Fine! I'll do ""Teen Wolf III."" I've got fair-weather friends to feed."
Bart,"Yeah, forget the donuts! We're here to go-nuts! Musically, that is!"
Bart,Rocks!
Bart,Rocks!
Bart,"Oh, shut up! Always trying to act so mature... I'm glad you make the least money."
Bart,"If Esposito thinks he's going to muscle us, he's wrong."
Bart,"When Willie asked me to be a presenter at the New Awareness Awards, I had to think about it... for about a microsecond."
Bart,So you know it's great.
Bart,I wanna visit a screen door factory!
Bart,"You're missing the best part, Sister. Forget that stupid book."
Bart,"Oh, it's not so bad..."
Bart,Ow!
Bart,I just got over the plague.
Bart,"Maybe you could be a dunce, Father."
Bart,Other brother and sister?
Bart,Hello? Lost lovable orphans!
Bart,"Hmm... Oh, whoa! Too hot!"
Bart,"Too cold. Well, this doesn't take a genius..."
Bart,That was close!
Bart,"Wow, a house made of gingerbread!"
Bart,"Eh, she seems nice. I'm gonna go with my gut and trust her."
Bart,Horribly delicious.
Bart,"Eh, what're you gonna do?"
Bart,"So, what do you care? It's not like you have friends."
Bart,"Speaking of which, how about seconds?"
Bart,Woo hoo! Yay Snorky!
Bart,Those dolphins seem bent on mayhem. We've gotta warn Grampa.
Bart,It's approaching the podium!
Bart,"Here you go, boy. Soup's on."
Bart,"Hey, if you're out here, then who's in there?"
Bart,"Whoa, a badger! Sorry man, you can't crash here. C'mon, let's go."
Bart,"Well boy, looks like you've got yourself a roommate."
Bart,"C'mon, Lis. There's gotta be a way to lure that badger out."
Bart,"Hmm... stoats, stoats..."
Bart,Then what's this?
Bart,Must you embarrass me?
Bart,"Hey, Todd! Can we borrow your woodpecker?"
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"No, there's a badger in there."
Bart,Tons.
Bart,"Dad, we're not in their area code anymore."
Bart,You should call that radio station and let 'em have it.
Bart,It worked on the test-corpse.
Bart,"Dad, you got syrup on your sash."
Bart,Give it back! That's my novelty flying disc.
Bart,My homework is in your park.
Bart,You c'mere a minute.
Bart,"Dad, I don't think this is such a good idea."
Bart,'Bout what?
Bart,"Well, Dad, you're mayor of a ghost town."
Bart,"Don't give up, Dad. Maybe we can get The Who to play here instead."
Bart,"Dad, the chloroform!"
Bart,Duh. Trashin' the hotel room.
Bart,"I love our Tuesdays together, Dad."
Bart,"Hey, we just took care of that dangerous melon that was threatening our garden."
Bart,Or is it?
Bart,"I said, or is it?"
Bart,Clear!
Bart,"Ooo, baby."
Bart,"That's the spirit. Now, what do you want to do?"
Bart,"Finally, books for today's busy idiot. ""Network Programming for Dummies""... ""Christianity for Dummies""... ""Mo""-- ""Moby Dick?""... ""Call me Ishmael, Dummy."""
Bart,How did you write all these books?
Bart,Eh.
Bart,"Oh, he's wonderful. He would do anything for his fans."
Bart,"Hey, it's me, Bart. Your biggest fan?"
Bart,K. the C.?
Bart,"Mush, Homer, mush!"
Bart,Two-fifty-six?
Bart,And I'm stuck with this useless two-fifty-two?
Bart,"Mom, can I have two hundred bucks for a two-fifty-six K GameStation? That's less than a dollar a K!"
Bart,I don't have a cap.
Bart,"Well, maybe I should."
Bart,I guess.
Bart,You're paying me in hair?
Bart,"What are you, insane?"
Bart,Man I need a job.
Bart,Hang 'em on the door. Got it.
Bart,I'm sorry.
Bart,"Hey man, this job is too dangerous."
Bart,I'unno. A million?
Bart,"True, but I gots to get paid. Money equals funny, sister."
Bart,Betty.
Bart,"Hey, some people in this family are do-ers, and some are don't-ers."
Bart,"Lisa and Jesse, sittin' in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g!"
Bart,Get out! What's the catch?
Bart,"Ah, yes. Ghastly business, that."
Bart,"And for the first time in my life, education was the answer."
Bart,"Thank you, thank you!"
Bart,I just buckled down and studied.
Bart,"Well, it all started last week in Krabappel's class..."
Bart,I was trying to breed the hamster with the lizard to create an unholy super-creature... when I saw an even worse crime against nature.
Bart,I needed to get my mind on something else. Anything else.
Bart,"Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars..."
Bart,"Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto..."
Bart,"So when I took the test, the answers were stuck in my brain. It was like a whole different kind of cheating."
Bart,Ow!
Bart,"Wanna rehearse, Dad?"
Bart,Christmas.
Bart,Rusty the Clown?! Springfield gets the lamest balloons.
Bart,Oh yeah...
Bart,I got suspended from school today.
Bart,They found a switchblade in my locker.
Bart,I took a swing at a cop.
Bart,I'm just mad all the time.
Bart,I heard Mayor Quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself.
Bart,Nelson.
Bart,"You know, it might've been Jimbo."
Bart,"There's something really different about you, Dad."
Bart,"Nice to have you back, Homer."
Bart,I wish she drank every day.
Bart,"Ooh, baby!"
Bart,"Man, magic can do anything!"
Bart,Cool! A gift shop.
Bart,"""Ages 8 to 80."" Hmm... That's me! Dad, will you get me this magic kit?"
Bart,"Wow, it's approved by the Royal Magic College of Hyderabad."
Bart,It is not!
Bart,Nuh-uh!
Bart,"Maybe I can make some money, Dad. My magic act is really coming along."
Bart,"Dad, only one of them is real."
Bart,"Hey, don't blame me. I gotta compete with TV, and the Internet."
Bart,"Yeah, and a good dad wouldn't miss his son's Little League games!"
Bart,"Well, I showed up for all your stupid interventions."
Bart,"Dad, come back! I can't walk home with all this stuff!"
Bart,"Hey, Homer! Check it out!"
Bart,"Yeah, I know a little place."
Bart,People. I guess they thought I was a charity case.
Bart,But wouldn't that make us con artists?
Bart,"So in a way, we'd just be balancing out the universe."
Bart,Sounds good. Wanna eat my fat?
Bart,"This book has all the classic cons. There's ""The Pigeon Drop,"" ""The Ear Wigger,"" ""The Brillstein Grab..."""
Bart,"Well, there's the ""Albany Ham Scam."""
Bart,"Oh, wait. Here we go..."
Bart,"Okay, Dad. Ready for our first con?"
Bart,"Nice use of the lingo, Homer."
Bart,"What happened? Where's my cake? It's all right, isn't it?"
Bart,"Wow, look at all this loot! What should we buy first?"
Bart,Or so it would seem...
Bart,"Here, boy! Here doggie. Oh where has my little dog gone?"
Bart,"Yeah, I saw him playing in the water, and then he was gone. He had a bright red leash, with bells on it."
Bart,He's the bestest dog ever. He's light brown and he has a spot on him shaped like a heart.
Bart,"I just gotta get him back!... Or if not him, a similar dog..."
Bart,"My Bar Mitzvah cake! Oy, I'll never be a man!"
Bart,Dad?
Bart,Why are we still grifting? The car's paid for. Doesn't that balance out the universe?
Bart,"Okay, I'm sold."
Bart,"Run, Dad!"
Bart,That was too close. Maybe it's time to quit the game.
Bart,You don't smoke a pipe.
Bart,"Wow, he did."
Bart,I don't know... Fleecin' old people?
Bart,"Oh, this is terrible. Now who do we give the money to?"
Bart,"Forget it, Ed. Do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big? Why, the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head."
Bart,"Throw the book at him, Sonny."
Bart,"Please, FBI man, don't throw us in jail. We just made one mistake."
Bart,"Okay, we're all locked up now..."
Bart,That's not an FBI badge.
Bart,That guy was a grifter!
Bart,Mom's gonna wonder where the car went. We'd better have a good story.
Bart,"Definitely. Well, crazy about carjacking."
Bart,"Wild, bushy hair, like an animal."
Bart,"And he said if we went to the cops, he'd come back for Maggie."
Bart,"Dad, Willie got arrested 'cause of us!"
Bart,"Dad, we've got to tell everyone the truth."
Bart,Dad! Tell them!
Bart,Daa-ad!
Bart,Wait a minute. This whole thing was a set-up?!
Bart,What about that bullet hole in your hair?
Bart,Cowabunga!
Bart,...My Dear Watson Detective School.
Bart,"Oh, everyone's off but us."
Bart,This stinks. We'll miss the Itchy and Scratchy where they finally kiss.
Bart,Hey!
Bart,I'm tired of taking orders from G.I. Jerk. I'm gonna tunnel outta here.
Bart,I was gonna put buttresses in.
Bart,"What's the problem, Seymour? Stuck?"
Bart,What's that? You want the pee bucket on your head?
Bart,"C'mon, we're takin' over the school!"
Bart,That's it. Cinch it up around the neck.
Bart,"Silence, Seymour. We're in charge now. Your reign of fussiness is over."
Bart,"Attention, the school is now under kid control. You are hereby ordered to go nuts!"
Bart,Stupid ice. I always knew I would die caked in something.
Bart,"Well, better turn off that engine. Before those fumes put us in tombs."
Bart,Mau! Didi mau!
Bart,I'm getting a cramp in my wrist!
Bart,"Oh, boo hoo. After all the times I've done it, my wrist sounds like a cement mixer."
Bart,"Come on, Seymour! Mau! Didi mau!"
Bart,"Ow! I told you, no one can climb a rope. It's physically impossible!"
Bart,"What part of ""didi mau"" don't you understand?"
Bart,"Quiet, Principal Spinner."
Bart,Underachiever and proud of it? How old is this thing?
Bart,"Let's see, he's forty years old, times twenty-five grand... Whoaa, he's a millionaire!"
Bart,"Look, I'm throwing papers."
Bart,"Look, the snow's melting!"
Bart,One of which?
Bart,"No, seriously, I wasn't listening."
Bart,Gotcha!
Bart,"Boy, that salt really ate through the car."
Bart,"Cool, Japanimation."
Bart,"Man, that Princess Tempura is one heck of a Transformazoid."
Bart,Cartoons don't have to make sense.
Bart,That dog's a riot.
Bart,I don't believe it. Say something else smart.
Bart,And this lead apron will keep me safe downstairs.
Bart,"Go, bull! Toss his salad!"
Bart,I don't have a blue shirt.
Bart,I'unno.
Bart,That Bob.
Bart,You gonna bribe 'em?
Bart,"Oh, can I have some?"
Bart,Is that enough?
Bart,Did you do those exercises he gave you?
Bart,Dad!
Bart,Are you okay?
Bart,That trash can must have unkinked your back.
Bart,"Okay, okay."
Bart,"Man, is that wimpy!"
Bart,"Hey, check it out!"
Bart,"Mmm, good pancakes, Mom."
Bart,"Hey Dad, bet you five bucks you can't eat the whole box."
Bart,And I won fifty bucks!
Bart,"Milhouse, my friend, you and I are going on a spending spree."
Bart,What about jags?
Bart,Wonderful.
Bart,I'm not really about gum. But I like the whole chewing thing...
Bart,Not at all.
Bart,Too much raw bacon.
Bart,I'm picking the next thing.
Bart,Looks like we're down to our last ten bucks Hello.
Bart,"Radioactive Man #1000, please."
Bart,We had to buy lunch for that homeless guy.
Bart,"Don't do it, lady. That stuff's worth thousands."
Bart,I can't believe I'm gonna miss that!
Bart,How could you have it planned out? You just heard about the problem.
Bart,Yeah. And why did we have to do this all the way from home?
Bart,Yeah. That should be us covered with blood!
Bart,Yeah. After you were so mean to us.
Bart,Looks like our lifetime ban just expired.
Bart,"Sorry, sorry."
Bart,That's just his shopping list.
Bart,"Well, we're gonna make some changes around here. This store's gonna be run by kids and for kids."
Bart,"Ah, nice to see ya'... Hey, how 'bout that Bloodzilla? Vampire Dinosaur, ohh, you can't make that stuff up..."
Bart,"Uh-uh, you gotta be forty inches tall for the adult section."
Bart,"Okay, but get on your tippy-toes."
Bart,Mark down the Poochie crap. And then unstick all the Supergirls.
Bart,"Less barking, more marking."
Bart,How could you spend all our money on a comic published by Lens Crafters?
Bart,We'll never sell these. Birds won't even use them in their nests.
Bart,It's my fault for leaving you in charge. Sometimes I forget how young you are.
Bart,"Oh, look, you're gettin' cranky. You haven't had your juice."
Bart,"It's a vacuum cleaner, Milhouse."
Bart,Shhhh. Use your indoor voice.
Bart,En garde!
Bart,Whoa...
Bart,"Look at all these bootleg videos! ""Alien Autopsy"" ""Illegal Alien Autopsy"", ""Godfather III -- Good Version""..."
Bart,It wasn't dad's fault. The ape tricked him. What's next?
Bart,"That's actually a great idea, Milhouse."
Bart,I'll say... Partner.
Bart,"I must warn you that once this next tape starts, it will not stop. Because that button is broken."
Bart,Got that right.
Bart,Yep. And we haven't been to school in days and days and days.
Bart,Cool!
Bart,With pleasure.
Bart,He's heading into Dead Man's Curve!
Bart,"Hey, get me outta here! Hey!"
Bart,Foxy boxing?
Bart,"...so from now on, all hats are banned from the school."
Bart,Oh. Hi Dad.
Bart,I am playing in the tournament.
Bart,I've got a partner.
Bart,"Yeah, you know her."
Bart,"Dude, I think the lady's made her decision."
Bart,I'm gonna put my trophy on the mantle. How 'bout you?
Bart,"We were good, Dad. They asked us to play in the Krusty Klassic!"
Bart,We can wipe out B.C. in our lifetime.
Bart,"I may have the looks, but he's the trophy husband."
Bart,He thought that trip to the guillotine factory was just for fun. But it was the perfect place to shoot him.
Bart,Lisa's your teammate?
Bart,Telegram for Lisa Simpson.
Bart,"Dear Lisa. Psych. Psych, psych, psych. Signed, Super-psych."
Bart,You're dumping me.
Bart,You're Andre. I'm Serena.
Bart,Amen.
Bart,Nutsy the clown.
Bart,This new morning announcer sounds awfully familiar.
Bart,"Ha. So long, suckers!"
Bart,"Oh, it's you, Bob. How ya doin'?"
Bart,"Hey, I'm not afraid of you. Every time we tangle, you wind up in jail. I'm 6 and 0."
Bart,I thought I was your arch-enemy.
Bart,What are you gonna do to me?
Bart,Krusty?! That's the one man I would never kill.
Bart,"Hey, stupid."
Bart,You looked!
Bart,I am at your command.
Bart,I am in your power.
Bart,"Hello, family."
Bart,I was... I was...
Bart,I was at the flower shop.
Bart,This is for Sideshow Bob.
Bart,Time to blow up the clown...
Bart,What-ever.
Bart,You got that right.
Bart,"Way to go, Slim!"
Bart,That tour is mine.
Bart,"Eh, I winna da race! Viva Italia!"
Bart,I love-a you all!
Bart,I use up all-a my English.
Bart,"Grazie, Springfield!"
Bart,Mob... Stranger. Mob... Stranger. Stranger.
Bart,Who are you?
Bart,"Well, it says here your name is ""L.T. Smash."""
Bart,"Please, Mom. My dream is to be a rock star."
Bart,"Wait, these are just guys from school. Who's next? Ralph Wiggum?"
Bart,"PARTY POSSE, WE RULE THE EARTH / THE GREATEST BAND SINCE MUSIC'S BIRTH."
Bart,Isn't this song a little boastful?
Bart,"Hel-lo, Springfield! Now, here's a song that your Principal Skinner doesn't want us to play."
Bart,"Screw you, man! We're gonna play it anyway!"
Bart,I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT AT THE SPELLING BEE...
Bart,I can't believe it. They loved us!
Bart,Really? You saw our B.F.N.?
Bart,Crowd taser?
Bart,Now we gotta send them a basket.
Bart,"Oh, yeah, that's the spot. Ohhh... that is perfect."
Bart,SO SING IT AGAIN...
Bart,"LET'S GET BACK TOGETHER / GIRL, LET'S RE-ENLIST..."
Bart,"Oww! Hot, hot, hot!"
Bart,Everybody ball-walk!
Bart,"Oh, yeah."
Bart,"Dad, L.T.'s gone crazy!"
Bart,Think he's gonna do something dangerous?
Bart,But how? We would need the ultimate chill-out song.
Bart,"Aw, come on, guys, we've only got a few minutes..."
Bart,Uh-oh...
Bart,"Aw, man, we could have been on the cover of ""MAD""."
Bart,"We said ""meh."""
Bart,Take that!
Bart,"Oh, why did I get this Lego shirt?"
Bart,"Right, right. Blocko shirt."
Bart,A girl at school won't go to the dance with me.
Bart,"No I don't, that's the problem."
Bart,Good grief.
Bart,All night. You were yelling at the swing.
Bart,"Dad, you were nuts."
Bart,"Uh, Dad?"
Bart,"Ohh, that's impossible."
Bart,But I gotta spit...
Bart,"Uh, Mom..."
Bart,Aw darn. Looks like we'll have to stay home today.
Bart,"Yeah, somebody should. One-hour dry cleaner. Man, that's fast."
Bart,"Look at the new kid, hoggin' the teeter-totter. It's like she owns the place."
Bart,I need this candy for school.
Bart,Candy Class.
Bart,I'm out of wine.
Bart,In the cart.
Bart,Yeah. I wish Maggie had to go to the emergency room more often.
Bart,"Hey, I found some eggs! The mother abandoned her nest."
Bart,"Whoa, a solid gold animal cracker."
Bart,Help! This mosquito net's not working.
Bart,"All right, I got another one!"
Bart,I'm looking at one right now.
Bart,What about him?
Bart,"Hey, check it out."
Bart,All right.
Bart,Uh-oh-boh-boh.
Bart,Which way should we go?
Bart,"Wow, Dad. How did you do that?"
Bart,Mount Kilimanjaro?
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Hey, maybe it'll lead us to bananas."
Bart,"Yeah, thanks for the grub."
Bart,Whatever.
Bart,"Ah, there's a burst of flavor."
Bart,Yes!
Bart,I think we should look at her research before we condemn her entirely.
Bart,I haven't said anything for a while.
Bart,"Hey, Lis, check it out."
Bart,Diamond Vision.
Bart,That's Milhouse.
Bart,And it sounds like he has big news!
Bart,That's Milhouse.
Bart,And it sounds like he has big news!
Bart,"Okay, okay."
Bart,That's Milhouse.
Bart,And it sounds like he has big news!
Bart,Is it a dead body?
Bart,You take my sister's bike.
Bart,"Let's see, front door, back door, Skinner's, Flanders', your house... ah, Lisa's bike."
Bart,What's it like riding a girl's bike?
Bart,Whoa. How'd you find it?
Bart,Cool.
Bart,"Wow, sacks! Burlap sacks!"
Bart,"Bottle rockets, Frog-Launchers, Weeping Mommas... Tijuana Toilet Crackers!"
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,We'll be safe in here!
Bart,Hootie and the Blowfish?
Bart,"Knock, knock."
Bart,"Excuse me, my friend and I were interested in purchasing quality fireworks."
Bart,"Milhouse, quick!"
Bart,Ow! Mo-om...
Bart,"Ice cream at church? I'm intrigued, yet suspicious."
Bart,"We can take whatever we want, right?"
Bart,You're right. We could use this for witchcraft.
Bart,Her pillow's stuck.
Bart,Kinda.
Bart,"Hey, Dad, something didn't get, um, ""sorted""."
Bart,You could fix up the old Storytime Village. They've been out of business ever since that kid got his head cut off.
Bart,Are you nuts?
Bart,Was I there?
Bart,"Yeah, folks, the power of Christ compels you to give Ned an extra ten bucks."
Bart,Who's next?
Bart,You better stick your head in and see what's going on.
Bart,Cool!
Bart,But the black man said...
Bart,"Sorry, I've got a baseball game in fifteen minutes."
Bart,Dad's been doing that for two hours!
Bart,"Yeah. Hey, Homer, I thought you were only gonna do this day care thing till your knee was better."
Bart,You haven't seen the real Homer. It's all burping and neglect.
Bart,Is that my jacket?
Bart,How come parents are always nicer to other kids than they are to their own?
Bart,"Well, don't worry. This'll give his heartstrings a much needed plucking."
Bart,Teamsters are sleeping in my room.
Bart,Ow! You stepped on my arm!
Bart,There's gotta be a way to get back at Dad.
Bart,No. We've gotta show the world what Dad's really like. Then everything will be back to normal.
Bart,Big phony!
Bart,This is the real Homer Simpson -- a beer-drinking meanie!
Bart,And he gambles like crazy.
Bart,I wanna visit a screen door factory!
Bart,Cool. A dead hobo.
Bart,"Hey, I found a bullet."
Bart,"Boy, that story had everything, a giant, house crushing, meteor..."
Bart,"Hey, Flanders gave us toothpaste."
Bart,"Hey, a fortune teller."
Bart,Can't live this way... anymore.
Bart,Eh. Who else we got?
Bart,"Hey, how 'bout 007?!"
Bart,"I just like it, is all."
Bart,"Hey Pierce, how'd you know our favorite foods?"
Bart,We're out of milk.
Bart,I studied! Abraca-turn-into-a-prince-guy?
Bart,You think you're so great just because you have God-like powers.
Bart,Get in there. Defend my honor!
Bart,And if I don't?
Bart,I'd like that. I'd like that very much.
Bart,"Hey, hey, you made your sale."
Bart,We'll see about that.
Bart,Shazbot.
Bart,This is partly my fault.
Bart,Prank be undone! Destroy the evil one!
Bart,Not me...
Bart,Aiyeeee!
Bart,Ew.
Bart,"Thanks, Lis. Now let's try to forget this nightmare."
Bart,Let's never miss the school bus again.
Bart,Big deal. It's just saltines and fig paste.
Bart,"Hey, check it out. Wiggum's cruiser."
Bart,"Wow, tear gas, riot club, police hat..."
Bart,"Ah, man, that would really keep your head dry."
Bart,Not in the front.
Bart,Really? What?
Bart,Check this out!
Bart,"You, there. Put your hands up."
Bart,"Now, drop your pants."
Bart,Hula out of them.
Bart,No! Get away!
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,Look out!
Bart,Good 'ol Judge Snyder.
Bart,"Well, it's showtime."
Bart,"Yes they are, Roy."
Bart,"Yes, sir."
Bart,"It was an accident, ma'am."
Bart,Can that judge do this to us?
Bart,"Mom, you cut the tether."
Bart,"You're on, Rope-a-dope!"
Bart,"Night terrors, ma'am."
Bart,"Hurry up, Dad!"
Bart,"Wow, my first home run."
Bart,"Can I ask you something, Dad?"
Bart,The town keeps getting bigger. Will there always be enough electricity?
Bart,"Uh, I don't think Lenny's house has a steeple."
Bart,"Yeah, this tether has some pluses."
Bart,I'm cold and scared.
Bart,"C'mon, Dad. Let's go."
Bart,"C'mon, Dad. I gotta go to the bathroom."
Bart,"Come on, Homer."
Bart,Mo-om!
Bart,Would you mind? I'm trying to do my homework.
Bart,The lady said no.
Bart,You shut up.
Bart,What'd you do that for?
Bart,Ah!
Bart,Who said that?
Bart,I'm a latchkey kid.
Bart,"No, it's terrible."
Bart,After wrestling.
Bart,'Cuz I felt like it.
Bart,"I know you are, but what am I?"
Bart,Your Honor! May I say something?
Bart,"Please, your Honor?"
Bart,"Your Honor, it's not easy being my parents. I'm always screwing up in school, and getting in trouble with the law. But if I grow up to be a halfway decent person, I know it'll be because of my Mom and Dad."
Bart,"Everyone else might give up on me, but my parents never will."
Bart,"So, your honor, if you're going to punish anyone in this courtroom today, I ask that you punish me."
Bart,Diggin'.
Bart,Make a hole.
Bart,More diggin'.
Bart,Yep.
Bart,Nuh-uh.
Bart,Go for it.
Bart,What's stopping you?
Bart,"Thanks, Bob."
Bart,My dad's always yelling that whitey's keepin' him down.
Bart,"If it happens, it happens."
Bart,"Yeah, I'd like to speak to a Mr. Tabooger. First name, Ollie."
Bart,Just ask if anyone knows Ollie Tabooger.
Bart,"Yell out ""I'll eat a booger."""
Bart,"Oh, forget it."
Bart,Just leave the bottle.
Bart,"Whatcha doin', Dad?"
Bart,Like the ones found in your local Yellow Pages.
Bart,I'm thankful I ate before I came.
Bart,"Uh, yeah. I'll have the shark butt with butt sauce."
Bart,"You're preachin' to the choir, man."
Bart,Are you talking about a soul patch?
Bart,We have a person-to-person call for Marge Simpson.
Bart,"Whoa, cool, he's still mental!"
Bart,This sounds like a case that only the Simpson family can solve.
Bart,"Oh, sorry."
Bart,"It's us, the Simpsons."
Bart,It's the body!
Bart,Then how do you explain this?
Bart,Who cares?
Bart,"Ha, busted!"
Bart,"From the looks of it, a male dog."
Bart,Lo-ser.
Bart,"Hey Lis, is Dad's credit card number 5784365343410709?"
Bart,"Hey Dad, will you help me build this model rocket?"
Bart,"Uh, he didn't say science... he said ""pie pants."""
Bart,"Over here, Guv'nor."
Bart,He's saying goodbye to his wife.
Bart,She already ate three.
Bart,"Dad, the rocket's off course!"
Bart,Now it's headed for the church.
Bart,Fine.
Bart,Still lookin' for a new faith?
Bart,"Hey, how 'bout one of those religions where you eat a human heart?"
Bart,How 'bout Methodist?
Bart,"How 'bout Judaism? When you turn thirteen, cha-ching."
Bart,"Yes, father."
Bart,"But Dad, my heart hurts."
Bart,I thought Kearney was dating your Mom.
Bart,All right! Trash cookies!
Bart,Uh-oh. I think I ate a dog food lid.
Bart,WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / WE WISH...
Bart,I thought we were caroling.
Bart,"That's it, baby. Welcome to Marvin Gardens."
Bart,"You're a little light here, Dad."
Bart,"Well, I'd like to trust you, Homer. But you've been in jail three times."
Bart,Who else is gonna take care of her? Dad?
Bart,"Hey, this is taffy!"
Bart,You're going to Stanford! You're going to Stanford!
Bart,You're going to Stanford.
Bart,I got sprayed by a skunk! Let me rub it off on your sweaters.
Bart,"Attention everyone, this is Gabriel, my personal social worker. He has to be here. I'm just that nuts."
Bart,They chose me.
Bart,But how are we supposed to get it?
Bart,"Okay, but it's my first time."
Bart,I got a set.
Bart,OUR BITTER FIGHTS ARE NOW HISTORY!
Bart,"Hey, ""Vegas Mom,"" how long are you gonna stay here?"
Bart,"Eh, I already got a system."
Bart,"Hey, the heart wants what it wants, dude."
Bart,"You crapped out, Vegas Mom."
Bart,Why would Duff Beer put out a book?
Bart,"Why don't you try to set a record, Dad?"
Bart,"Yeah, Dad! You can be the world's laziest stunt organizer!"
Bart,"Mom, we're out of ""Frosting Gobs."""
Bart,The prostitute with a heart of gold.
Bart,I think he's grossed-out by some seaweed.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"Can we, Mom? Can we? Please, please, please?"
Bart,"I prefer to egg him on. Hey Dad, has the movie started yet?"
Bart,"Hey, Dad. I'm gonna make a human yo-yo. If you object, clearly say ""no""."
Bart,"No objections, eh? Oh, that's great."
Bart,"Milhouse, you ready to imitate that ""Jackass"" show?"
Bart,"So the substitute teacher comes in and says her name is Mrs. Doody. And everyone's looking at me like ""Take it, Bart. Run with it"". And it hits me: I've become a clown... a class clown. And it sickens me."
Bart,We're rehearsing a play.
Bart,There she is!
Bart,"Wait, I know. Beer here!"
Bart,He saved her! Oh. Isn't it great to have the old Dad back?
Bart,Whatever.
Bart,"Cool, Mom's on drugs. If we turn her in we get a form letter from Dick Cheney!"
Bart,"Pedals, people."
Bart,Ooooh.
Bart,Let's approach with caution!
Bart,"Thank you, you've been very helpful."
Bart,"Dad just got a library card in West Springfield. He checked out ten books on oil rigging and a book called ""Dying for Dummies."""
Bart,You can always find your favorite shows next month.
Bart,No one's doing any bumping. Time to ram-a-lam these ding dongs.
Bart,"Drop the backpack, Jack."
Bart,Those weren't bullies. That's a bully.
Bart,Your Dad's McBain?
Bart,"Wow, cool! Uh, I guess we're leaving, too."
Bart,"Excuse me, but you don't sound as tough as you do in the movies."
Bart,"Wow! The Q-tip he used to kill Ross Perot! Ho-ho, everything in your house is so cool."
Bart,"Oh, it's okay. My bed is stuffed with hay."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,What are you doing?
Bart,"Ohh, I got ya."
Bart,"One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war."
Bart,"Hey, that was a fast count!"
Bart,"Yeah, this is Milhouse. He's my best friend, because ... well, geographical convenience really."
Bart,Just go.
Bart,"Ohhh, he'll sleep tonight."
Bart,"Yeah, I guess."
Bart,"Oh-ho, we are so there."
Bart,"Oh, yeah. Maybe I should keep my promise."
Bart,That's it. I'm blowing off the dance. This is the biggest thing that's happened to me since chocolate milk.
Bart,Sey-mour...
Bart,Sey-mour...
Bart,Loser principal!
Bart,"Oh, man. What a dork."
Bart,"Lisa, I only lied because it was the easiest way to get what I wanted."
Bart,"Hey, I didn't lead her on. I always played it light and breezy."
Bart,"All right, I know what to do. I'll dump her like she's never been dumped before, then we'll go right back to being friends."
Bart,"Lis, women are easy. State capitals are hard."
Bart,"Greta, I'm sorry I didn't handle the breakup well. But you're a sweet kid and some day you'll find someone who..."
Bart,"Milhouse? Greta? Well, no one has to draw me a picture."
Bart,"Greta, is this how it is?"
Bart,"Oh, I was an idiot. Now I'll be alone forever. Why did I break up with her?"
Bart,Prove it. Using examples from this room.
Bart,Gimme the ball! Gimme the ball!
Bart,"Uh, Greta, it's me. I think you left your pencil over at my house and he's there now, isn't he?"
Bart,I knew it. You're there. Just hear me out.
Bart,You're going to Spain?!
Bart,"...so to win Greta back, I have to go to Toronto."
Bart,"This is for love, Dad. Someday you'll feel what I feel."
Bart,"Wow, this bus station is the birthplace of Paul Shaffer."
Bart,I'm a ten year old boy in Toronto. I should be the happiest kid in the world... but I can't stop thinking about Greta.
Bart,There it is -- Wolfcastle's movie set.
Bart,"I don't know, Dad. What if she's still mad at me?"
Bart,But she might say no.
Bart,"Milhouse, she's only dating you to get back at me."
Bart,"Greta, I miss you so much. Please be my girlfriend again."
Bart,Need a unit production manager?
Bart,"Well, I guess we're single again."
Bart,'Til the next one. So what'll we do now?
Bart,I've got just the ticket. Come on.
Bart,Yep. It's just that easy.
Bart,Aha! A free baseball.
Bart,A shiny new dime!
Bart,A shinier new dime!
Bart,What flavor?
Bart,This day just keeps getting better and better.
Bart,And here's a new four-legged friend for me. Hiya boy. Haven't seen you around here before.
Bart,"Mom, a dog ate my clothes!"
Bart,Help!
Bart,A crazy dog's trying to kill me!
Bart,What?
Bart,Eat my short stories!
Bart,Whew. Safe at last. Now I'll just turn around and confirm that safety.
Bart,"Hey, wait a minute. These animals are stuffed."
Bart,Ow! Except that one.
Bart,You were in movies?
Bart,Who?
Bart,"No kiddin'. Anyway, I climbed over your gate. A dog was after me."
Bart,Who?
Bart,Keep him away from me.
Bart,"Whoa, it worked!"
Bart,Where did you learn that?
Bart,No.
Bart,"Well, right now, I'm supposed to be in school."
Bart,It's like you're living in a steakhouse!
Bart,Is that horse vacuuming?
Bart,Five o'clock? I better get home for dinner.
Bart,"Oh, he's not bothering me any more. Buck McCoy helped me."
Bart,Cool.
Bart,What's this lunchbox made of?
Bart,"Met-tal. Hey, can you still do cowboy tricks?"
Bart,Everything tastes better when it's lassoed.
Bart,Buck gave it to me. He's just about the greatest guy who ever lived. I wanna grow up to be just like him.
Bart,"That's great, champ. I know you've been wantin' that. Well, gotta mosey. Homer. Ma'am."
Bart,I can't wait till I get good.
Bart,Buck's here!
Bart,"Dad, why are you wearing that?"
Bart,So that's how you ended your career?
Bart,"Yeah, we can have showdowns at the schoolyard and use nerds as Indians!"
Bart,I was thinkin' this could be A new fad.
Bart,"Now, listen up. When I come back tomorrow you'd better have cowboy suits. And they'd better be adorable."
Bart,"Krusty, how do you feel about putting Buck McCoy on your show?"
Bart,Buck McCoy.
Bart,Please put Buck on. He's my hero.
Bart,They're dead?
Bart,"Boy, that's some fancy shootin'."
Bart,He's drunk!
Bart,"What happened, Buck?"
Bart,That is just grotesque.
Bart,"Eh, we could try it."
Bart,"Way to go, Buck. I feel my faith growing anew."
Bart,"Buck, you're my hero again."
Bart,"Well, there's Krusty, Itchy, Scratchy, Poochie, America's firefighters and then you, Dad."
Bart,"It's Grampa's smell. ""Old Old Spice."""
Bart,B-6.
Bart,"Hey, Grampa. Stealing Mom's car?"
Bart,"Uh, it's actually blue wire to yellow wire."
Bart,Can I tag along?
Bart,The lady knows funny.
Bart,"What are those, Grampa?"
Bart,There it is!
Bart,Is that her?
Bart,Is that her?
Bart,Is that her?
Bart,Is that her?
Bart,All gone.
Bart,"Grampa, look over there."
Bart,"It's Captain Bringdown and the Buzzkillers. If you're gonna make your move, you better do it quick."
Bart,What happened?
Bart,"Dad, I loved it, too, but it was seven years ago."
Bart,"Mom, maybe it's time to choose a suitor."
Bart,I'll leave you guys alone.
Bart,I'm on it.
Bart,She's talking to her invisible friend. God.
Bart,"Joan, give me your dessert."
Bart,"Dad, these old stories can't compare with our modern super-writers. Stephen Bochco could kick Shakespeare's ass."
Bart,Cool. Does he get to marry his Mom?
Bart,"Could that fat ghost be telling the truth? First I've got to get Uncle Claudius to confess, then I've gotta kill him."
Bart,Are you crazy? I can't believe a play where every character was murdered could be so boring.
Bart,"Dad, that line was in the cartoon."
Bart,"No sir, I didn't."
Bart,"No, I think it's Niagular."
Bart,"Crazy scheme, crazy scheme, crazy scheme..."
Bart,Yes!
Bart,We found you smoldering in the bushes.
Bart,"Well, we've got to find him! What? I'm really concerned. Fine, I want to meet monkeys."
Bart,Then I'll have been on every continent.
Bart,"Get ready, Brazil. I now speak fluent Spanish."
Bart,"Ay caramba, que mujer tonta! Veinte horas estudiar por nada!"
Bart,"Boy, they sure love soccer here."
Bart,Kids' show.
Bart,"Look, the room came with a fruit hat."
Bart,I'M CHIQUITA BANANA / AND I'M HERE TO SAY...
Bart,"Yeah, check out the rats."
Bart,Have you tried looking for him?
Bart,"Have some meat on a sword, Lisa. It'll cheer you up."
Bart,"Hey look, there's Copacabana beach. The heart and soul or Rio."
Bart,I feel so European.
Bart,There's gotta be a million kids here. We'll never find Ronaldo.
Bart,You know him?
Bart,"Just one, and it's across town."
Bart,This guy's always on!
Bart,"Dad, I thought you didn't like her saxophone."
Bart,"As long as you're doin' things for me, would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house."
Bart,"Yeah. Hop in, Homer."
Bart,What's a telegram?
Bart,"You know, Lisa, they say father knows best."
Bart,But it's all worth it just to hear him sing.
Bart,Why him?
Bart,Why does Danger Dog mean more to me than school or church?
Bart,Mine is Danger Dude. But he's a dog.
Bart,Oh yeah.
Bart,"Well, I'm my own toughest critic, but I think it's genius. Now to sell it for millions."
Bart,Creator of Marvel Comics?!
Bart,It's that good?
Bart,What did I do wrong?
Bart,So you're saying I should keep trying?
Bart,I just need one great idea...
Bart,"Batman!... oh, it's been done."
Bart,Green Lantern!... nah.
Bart,"I'd know, mom."
Bart,"Hm, all I need is one classic character..."
Bart,Hey...
Bart,What's it to ya?
Bart,"Oh, this is perfect."
Bart,A couple of stink lines around his butt... and I'm done.
Bart,Thanks guys.
Bart,"Uh, it's a composite character -- your Dad, my Dad, a little of Maggie's Dad..."
Bart,"Maybe Angry Dad needs a sidekick -- ""Know-It-All Sister""."
Bart,"Wow, I made it! My week-long dream has come true."
Bart,Stan Lee came back?
Bart,"Wow! ""Angry Dad""... an internet cartoon. I'll be in cyberspace next to the Nabisco cookie web site."
Bart,Whoa!
Bart,This is people working?
Bart,This is great.
Bart,"What up, man? This is my manager slash sister, Lisa."
Bart,So what do you want to do with it?
Bart,"Okay, let's hear it."
Bart,Wow! I think we have our Angry Dad.
Bart,I can't wait that long.
Bart,In association with Ay Carumba Entertainment.
Bart,How'd you like to be played by John Goodman?
Bart,"Come on, Angry Dad. Get angry! Don't make me do a clip show!"
Bart,"This little trap is gonna make my Dad angrier than he's ever been. In the meantime, I gotta tell those internet guys to hold tight."
Bart,Good idea. You can speak nerd to them.
Bart,Oh my God! What happened?
Bart,Bubbles can burst?!
Bart,What do you mean it's over?
Bart,But I have fifty-two million shares! What's fifty-two million times zero? And don't tell me it's zero!
Bart,"Yeah, but at least now that my show's cancelled, I don't need material, so there's no need to lure my Dad into the trap I set up for him. The trap!"
Bart,Thank God his pants stayed on.
Bart,I know. I'm sorry.
Bart,"Say it, don't spray it."
Bart,You're not welcome.
Bart,"Ha, ha, you love a boy."
Bart,"If you love me so much, why don't you marry me? That's a good one."
Bart,The Squishee Lady!
Bart,"I am Ganeesh, your god!"
Bart,"I order you to get back together... or I'll suck your blood. Blah, blah!"
Bart,You're the jerk.
Bart,This Squishee is awful!
Bart,"Why, I didn't even notice!"
Bart,"What's your Nostalgia Prize, Grampa?"
Bart,I got a plastic Krusty-saurus.
Bart,Hmmm...
Bart,A mosquito?
Bart,How'd that get in there?
Bart,Ow!
Bart,I don't feel so good. Can you take me to the hospital?
Bart,"No, I told you, a mosquito came out of my Laffy Meal and bit me."
Bart,I did want ice cream.
Bart,Contagious? Outrageous!
Bart,I got me some teachers to lick.
Bart,"I don't like how many times you said ""normal."""
Bart,Help me!
Bart,Everyone's staring at me.
Bart,I think this soup's a little hot.
Bart,"My bubble, my rules."
Bart,"Never fear, the sphere is here!"
Bart,"When nerds are in trouble, I am not slow. It's spin, spin, spin and away I go!"
Bart,Are you kidding? This little baby has made me more popular than ever.
Bart,The bubble makes everything shimmer and glow. You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me.
Bart,"Tomato, tomato."
Bart,I know a way you can win back the kids at school.
Bart,All you gotta do is play a prank on the principal.
Bart,We've got a little planning to do. Step into my office.
Bart,It wasn't me.
Bart,"Good going, Lis. And it sure is great to be out of that bubble."
Bart,Sure is sunny... Was the air always this fresh?... I'm just gonna hang out in this vent.
Bart,Does this thing suck or blow? Suuuuck!
Bart,"Put him down, boy! Put him down!"
Bart,"Yeah, if Dad killed everyone he talked about killing, would any of us be here?"
Bart,I'm Bart and this is Lisa.
Bart,We were in the Green Room. I had so much shrimp!
Bart,"Look at those looters breaking windows, setting fires... They're living my dream, and you won't let me join them. Please can I throw one little..."
Bart,What if I just burn down a...
Bart,Can't I at least incite further...
Bart,Can I have a beer?
Bart,Dad...
Bart,I didn't know my chin went that far up.
Bart,"Cool, a lie detector."
Bart,Lisa is a dork. Lisa is a dork.
Bart,"Ne-e-ed, I'm ba-a-ack! Give me a ki-i-iss."
Bart,"Chill out dudes, it's me, Bart Simpson."
Bart,What are you lookin' at?
Bart,Me not notice.
Bart,"Rest in peace, pal."
Bart,Lisa has a dead boyfriend!
Bart,CALF'S IN THE FIELD SO YOU SNEAK UP SLOW / GRAB 'IM BY THE TAIL AND GO MAN GO...
Bart,"Tell me again why we're spending our vacation on ""The Island of Lost Souls""?"
Bart,"Quiet, youse!"
Bart,"Hey Dad, check it out!"
Bart,"""Homer, I need cash or they're gonna break my legs."""
Bart,"No, it was the night you got loaded at Moe's and the car had to be towed home."
Bart,"I will, Dad."
Bart,"I had no idea, Dad. I just assumed with all the stranglings, you know..."
Bart,"Sorry we ruined your life, Homer."
Bart,You are.
Bart,"Sorry, Dad. Maybe now you'll appreciate us..."
Bart,"And even though you knew I ratted you out to the IRS, you never busted me on it."
Bart,"Stop kicking me, Dad!"
Bart,Finally. Can we go now?
Bart,"Woo! Yay, Homer!"
Bart,"Did you know it was going to turn into a riot, Dad?"
Bart,"Hey, let's get one of those home satellite dishes! Then we can stop suckling on the six-network teat."
Bart,"And the Lord said, ""Let there be crap."""
Bart,Cool! It's the NBC news feed!
Bart,You get to see what they do during commercial breaks.
Bart,"Hey Lis, wanna try some satellite TV? We've got Japanese Friends."
Bart,How about the Clock Channel?
Bart,"Wait a minute, I saw this one."
Bart,"Hey, I don't have to study on the weekend."
Bart,What's a fortnight?
Bart,She's not so great! She got diarrhea when we went to Carlsbad Caverns!
Bart,What? I've gotta be in the same class as her?
Bart,Roosters don't lay eggs. They're boys.
Bart,Mm-hm.
Bart,Quiet nerds burp only near school.
Bart,"I know. That's how you remember the four original provinces of Canada: Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario, Nova Scotia -- ""Quiet nerds burp only near school."" And here's how you remember the principal exports: ""Dogs eat barf solely on Wednesday, Mabel."""
Bart,"Canada's Governors General: ""Clowns love haircuts; so should Lee Marvin's valet."""
Bart,"An ""A""? Copacetic."
Bart,"Eh, I took this test last year. The answer key never changes. B-C-B-C-A-A-B-B-C-C-D-False-False-True-William Jennings Bryan."
Bart,"Hey, get away from me! / Quit it! Ow! / Ew! / Quit it! / Stop! / Ow! / Let go!"
Bart,I'll take Kyle!
Bart,Punch buggy red!
Bart,Ow!
Bart,"When you see a Volkswagen Bug, you punch somebody and yell the color."
Bart,The Capital City Goofball?
Bart,Homework on a field trip? What have you been huffin'?
Bart,"When I get through with that flag, it's gonna be a Bart Mangled Banner."
Bart,"We would, Governor Bailey! Team Simpson!"
Bart,"Lisa, how could you? The governor is crying."
Bart,You should have seen the look on your face. It was something like this.
Bart,"Ha-ha, they left without you."
Bart,"If I'm such an idiot, how come I'm the smartest kid in the third grade?"
Bart,You've lost me.
Bart,"No problem. We'll just circle around like those kids in ""The Blair Witch Project."""
Bart,I must be getting close! I recognize that girl.
Bart,"I used to be lost. Until a friend turned me onto a book. A book that changed my life. It's called ""Lisa is Stupid."""
Bart,You cold?
Bart,Here.
Bart,"Well, as far as nerdy little sisters go, you're the coolest."
Bart,And I'm sorry I sabotaged your flag.
Bart,"Oh, and I'm sorry I sawed the heads off your Malibu Stacy dolls. Okay, you go."
Bart,"Okay, I'll go again. Remember when your bike was mangled by ""gypsies?"""
Bart,"Yeah, funny story. One day, I was really bored. And Dad had left the steam roller idling in the driveway..."
Bart,"Oh Lord, please strike these mountain folk dead--"
Bart,Thanks for driving us back to town.
Bart,Yay!
Bart,Let's see what's on TV.
Bart,"Oh cool, the old ""Batman"" show."
Bart,"Well, sure. He was also Uncle Velderschmoink on ""Bewitched."""
Bart,Cool! We should try that at school!
Bart,"Milhouse, if you're uncomfortable with this in any way... Do it, Otto! Do it! Do it! Do it!"
Bart,"Hey, what's going on here, something crazy?"
Bart,"Uh, I saw Krusty do it on TV!"
Bart,Don't worry. Krusty always lands on his feet.
Bart,"Mom, Lisa pushed me in the laundry basket."
Bart,"Wow Mom, your guns got us a great table -- right by the lobster tank."
Bart,"That's great, Mom. But don't forget..."
Bart,I GOT KRUSTY IN HOT WATER / NOW I'VE GOT TO HELP HIM OUT / DA DA DA...
Bart,"Oh, I don't get a song? Mom got a song."
Bart,"Oh man, now they won't let Krusty do anything fun."
Bart,"Hey, we got Krusty into this and we'll get him out. We just have to make him a hero again."
Bart,"Hey, it didn't help your dad get your mom back."
Bart,"What's with the belt, Mom?"
Bart,I thought you liked all the attention you were getting.
Bart,"Hey, Krusty."
Bart,The doorman died.
Bart,"Listen, I have a plan that will make the world fall in love with Krusty the Clown again."
Bart,The Krusty I know didn't get where he is by givin' up.
Bart,It's simple. We just have to cause a riot at the Springfield Shoe Expo.
Bart,"Okay, here's the drill. A rogue elephant -- played by my old friend Stampy -- is about to crush sweet young Milhouse. Then you run up and save the day, by saying Stampy's safety word, ""MOGUMBO""."
Bart,Who will save this promising young honor student?
Bart,And you learned that a woman doesn't need a forty-eight inch chest to be beautiful.
Bart,Lisa learned a lesson! Lisa learned a lesson!
Bart,"Whoa, this is gonna be the coolest basketball game ever!"
Bart,Nooo!
Bart,Can you paint me knocking out Larry Holmes?
Bart,"Okay, where do you want it?"
Bart,"Heads up, Dad. Here comes the scum!"
Bart,This sucks. How come Lisa gets something and I don't?
Bart,"Hey Ma, our crap shack's going to hell."
Bart,I do not want another lecture from a German backpacker about how we don't appreciate the national park system.
Bart,What the hell was that?
Bart,"Oh man, I can't wear this. I look like Buster Brown, whoever that is."
Bart,"Good morning, ladies."
Bart,"Hey, you should see how much trouble Dad's having shaving with a straight razor."
Bart,"This has been the worst week of my life. I miss my toys, my video games... ""Mutt 'n' Jeff"" comics are not funny."
Bart,"They're gay, I get it."
Bart,I'm so cold.
Bart,"Yes, mum. I thought I was regular before, but I was wrong."
Bart,Do we get lunch?
Bart,"Hey Dad, why don't we watch you drink from a hose?"
Bart,This place blows. I'm gonna go float a Baby Ruth down the mineral bath.
Bart,Mm hm.
Bart,Wait. Wait. Wait. Bob can't stay with us. This man has tried to kill me so much it's not funny anymore.
Bart,"Dad, I can't believe you're putting my life at risk to save your own."
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,I don't know how we ever had fun without him.
Bart,"Dad, I'm really glad you're still alive."
Bart,Huh? Why not?
Bart,YOU'VE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO MY FACE...
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,Was that the war with Hitler or Merlin?
Bart,"Okay, time to start this paper. World War One. W.W. One. Well, that's a good start. Time to watch wrestling!"
Bart,"Okay, gotta focus, gotta focus, gotta look at that bird, gotta focus."
Bart,Prank or study? Prank or study?
Bart,"What should I do, Lord? Give me a sign."
Bart,"""Russia, Great Britain and France had formed an entente cordiale..."""
Bart,"Ooh, algebra... I'll just do a few equations. No! No more distractions!"
Bart,But I just started my paper.
Bart,Black Hawk up!
Bart,Attention teenage boys. Take your hands off my daughter!
Bart,"Grampa, quick, tell me everything you know about World War One!"
Bart,"Oh, this is great stuff -- I can pad it out to ten pages. Goodnight, Grampa."
Bart,"Well, if I may dust off an old chestnut, aye carumba. Aye carumba indeed."
Bart,"""... and so on November 11, 1918, the guns fell silent and peace returned. The End."""
Bart,"He's a wiener, Mrs. K. Just say the word and his desk is full of boogers."
Bart,"Okay, there's a lot of low cards in that hand. But since we're both free, why don't you and me hit the town?"
Bart,... And did you know the hole's only natural enemy is the pile?
Bart,"Hey, I only hung out with Krabappel because Skinner blew her off. I've never seen her so sad."
Bart,"Dad, you bought that, because it was full of gummy worms."
Bart,They have an award for teaching?
Bart,"I'd like to nominate my teacher, Mrs. Krabappel. She may not be glamorous or entertaining... She's just a real teacher who comes in every day no matter what. And she never gave up on me, Bart Simpson."
Bart,"I can't express how I feel in words, so I drew this picture."
Bart,"These stink lines stand for dedication, caring, and for letting me drink coffee in class. Way to go, Edna!"
Bart,"So because I nominated Mrs. K, our whole family gets a free trip to the award ceremony in Orlando!"
Bart,Nope.
Bart,Uh-uh.
Bart,Fraid not.
Bart,"Sorry, Grampa."
Bart,You wish.
Bart,"Grampa, you're not even going."
Bart,"Seymour? Glad you're here. You can help me play ""Halloween Hit and Run."""
Bart,But I don't want to hurt Mrs. K.
Bart,"All right, I'm in. I'll humiliate the love of your life. Because I like you, I'll even do it pro boner."
Bart,I know what I said.
Bart,W-u-w-h-a-a-t... W-w-wuh... h-h-huh...
Bart,"I'm sorry, I can't read. Mrs. Krabappel never taught me to read!"
Bart,"No arguments here. Man, I really come off like a jerk in this thing."
Bart,"Dad, you can't eat all those free samples. We've got to get Lisa's present."
Bart,"Dad, you ate all the free samples. Now you're eating men's slacks."
Bart,It's not for me. I'm not a girl like you.
Bart,It's really cool. You can point a red dot at people's crotches from really far away.
Bart,I'm still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe.
Bart,"Aw, Mom... This'll take your mind off them."
Bart,"Hey Dad, will you read me a bedtime story?"
Bart,Whoa! A sword-cane!
Bart,There is no way all this junk is gonna fit in that car.
Bart,She's in the back yard!
Bart,"Ugh. Ew, Mom, I think Maggie fudged her Huggies."
Bart,"Come on, Mom, let's go."
Bart,"Mom, are you okay?"
Bart,And you parked on top of the mailman.
Bart,Um hm.
Bart,What if she doesn't?
Bart,"Breaker, breaker. Bartman to shut-in. The big guy's asleep. Please advise. Over."
Bart,I roger that big time.
Bart,No way.
Bart,Mom!
Bart,"Dad, do you plan to get in shape?"
Bart,Excellent.
Bart,Huh? Why didn't Mom make our lunch?
Bart,Ay carumba! I'm off women forever.
Bart,"Second place!? Oh man, this'll just encourage her."
Bart,Whoa! Check out Janeane Giraffe-alo.
Bart,"Szechwan, eh? No wonder she's so spicy."
Bart,"Fine, I'll go back to being bored."
Bart,"Lisa Leslie, you got game!"
Bart,You go girl!
Bart,The Cowgirls versus the She-gles. No love lost there.
Bart,Anything's better than that dump we came from.
Bart,"Dad, there's a bunch of people in the Community Outreach Center."
Bart,"Dad, maybe you should stop praying. See if that makes It happy."
Bart,"Yeah, but what made the rain stop?"
Bart,"Hey, a box of old videotapes."
Bart,"Hm, ""Marge and Homer Get Dirty."""
Bart,"Hey, Lis! Think you're well adjusted? I've got something to show you."
Bart,Every tape is pumpkin carving.
Bart,"Oh my God, that's me!"
Bart,"Wait, I was in a commercial? I don't remember this at all."
Bart,How could you make me Baby Stink Breath and not even tell me?
Bart,I did? Where is it?
Bart,You spent all the money I earned?!
Bart,You stole my money!
Bart,"Mom, I am sick of the way he treats me. He disrespects me and I'm just supposed to accept it?"
Bart,So my Dad blew all the money I made from that embarrassing commercial. Promise me you won't tell anyone about it.
Bart,I just wish there was some way to get back at my Dad.
Bart,Does it make him cry?
Bart,"Hmmm. Badger, Haggle and Bill,"" ""Luvum and Burnham, Family Law,"" ""Hackey, Joke and Dunnit."" Bingo!"
Bart,I want a divorce from my parents.
Bart,I said I want a divorce from my parents.
Bart,"Yes, I want to be emancipated."
Bart,"Mom, you've always been cool to me. But Homer is a lousy dad and I'm not gonna take it anymore."
Bart,Here... and here.
Bart,How can I fit my whole life into a suitcase? Maybe if I move that thing there... perfect.
Bart,"With the money Dad's paying me, I rented a loft downtown."
Bart,No. I assume it has hay.
Bart,Here's something to remember me by.
Bart,Look at it.
Bart,"If I did it right, it's permanent."
Bart,Sorry Mom. I just can't. Not as long as he's here.
Bart,Sorry Mom. I gotta go.
Bart,"Well here I am, on my own. And I'm gonna make it, world!"
Bart,"Being a free man is great, Milhouse. I can draw on myself with a magic marker."
Bart,"Boy, it's really empty in here."
Bart,Now calm down. I'm perfectly safe. Murder's illegal in this state.
Bart,"Okay, that was just my imagination."
Bart,Mommy!
Bart,Not up! Down!
Bart,I'm gonna die in my jammies!
Bart,"I'm-I'm Bart Simpson, and-- Hey, are you skateboarding legend Tony Hawk?"
Bart,You live in this building?
Bart,I'll adjust.
Bart,"Oh man, this is the greatest night of my life. If my Dad could see this he'd be so mad."
Bart,"Thanks for the lift, Tony Hawk. I've gotta go now, Tony Hawk."
Bart,"Cool guy, Tony Hawk."
Bart,"Please, I'm trying to keep it quiet. Catch ya later, Tony Hawk."
Bart,Hi guys... Dad.
Bart,"Well, you need an expensive couch to watch an expensive TV."
Bart,"...And for every syringe I find, I get a dollar."
Bart,"Thanks Dad, that means a lot to me."
Bart,"Sorry, no can do. I'm taking off for six months to join the Skewed Tour."
Bart,And nipple piercing.
Bart,"Don't worry, they're clip-ons."
Bart,"Dad, how drunk are you?"
Bart,"Dad, you don't understand. This was never about being cool. It was about you not caring how I felt."
Bart,"Don't worry, Dad, it's just a commercial. No one will remember this in fifty years."
Bart,I can't just sit here watching this junk.
Bart,That's better.
Bart,"Dude, take it easy on the fatty foods. You're running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart."
Bart,"Yes, sir."
Bart,"Nelson, how was your summer?"
Bart,What'd you do?
Bart,"C'mon man, everyone knows the first day of school is a total wank."
Bart,Imply. I-M-P...
Bart,"Well, I got my laugh. I'm outta here."
Bart,"Hey, Lisa said she was--"
Bart,"Finally, a Simpson has a trophy without a bowling ball on it."
Bart,He's an acerose.
Bart,"Look, I didn't bring a GameBoy. This is all I got."
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Well, I'm all set, too."
Bart,I think she needs a diaper change.
Bart,Or the Fox Network getting a new President.
Bart,"Yeah, she's had more stars on her than Lisa's homework."
Bart,Rainier Wolfcastle!?
Bart,"Look, it's celebrity boy-toy Ned Flanders and his arm candy, Sara Sloane."
Bart,Why don't you ask those guys?
Bart,I got Lisa's plankton kebabs!
Bart,"Hey, Krusty should run for Congress. He could help us with the airplanes!"
Bart,I'm not dying.
Bart,"Krusty, we need you to run for Congress."
Bart,Immigration?
Bart,"But, if you get elected, you can change all that, and stop those stupid airplanes from flying over my house."
Bart,"Aw, all the good ones. Hmm, I've never even heard of number nine."
Bart,Can I keep this?
Bart,"Sorry, you can't join us. This is a hundred dollar a plate Krusty fundraiser."
Bart,"Krusty, I can't believe you're giving up. I thought you'd make a difference, that's why I voted for you."
Bart,This is not about me. Or how many times I voted.
Bart,Poor Krusty.
Bart,"Congressman, I have a tape here of you using your free-mail privilege to send a get well card to your aunt."
Bart,At last those planes are flying where they belong.
Bart,"Oh, okay."
Bart,What?
Bart,"Do it, Dad. You could get a less- crappy car."
Bart,Oh yeah. From my room I can hear everything.
Bart,Now fly -- To the Canary Islands!
Bart,"Hey Dad, you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight."
Bart,I don't wanna do that.
Bart,Check it out! I'm Tomokaz Ohka of the Montreal Expos.
Bart,"Hey Dad, pitch to me!"
Bart,Hey! You nearly hit me on the head!
Bart,Y'see? This is the stuff Mom won't do with me.
Bart,He didn't say anything about Skinner-in-a-shredder.com.
Bart,"I chuck 'em at nerds, girls I like, whatever."
Bart,Ow!
Bart,"I'm telling! Oh, man."
Bart,"So? I'll bounce back. I always bounce back -- like after the time I accidentally called the teacher ""Mom""."
Bart,The only way to be cooler than him is to do exactly what he does. I've gotta steal me a hood ornament! But how?
Bart,Nelson steals a hood ornament and now he's king of the school. All that's left for me is to become the biggest drunk this town's ever seen.
Bart,"Hey, check out this hood ornament I stole."
Bart,Every car's been harvested!
Bart,I've got to get that hood ornament. No matter who owns it.
Bart,Time to get that hood's ornament.
Bart,"Hey, we're all gonna be murdered some day."
Bart,Just hold the light.
Bart,"No Lis, I've got my eyes on the prize: the hood ornament I desperately want. For reasons I can no longer remember. The only thing stopping me is those lights."
Bart,You can say it. I add nothing.
Bart,How'd you get Dad to go along with this?
Bart,"But Gandhi also said ""less talk, more rock""!"
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Dad, we weren't playing Pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking."
Bart,"Go crazy, dorks. I got better things to do."
Bart,I'm in.
Bart,"Sky, sky, sky with building, grass, grass with foot."
Bart,"Or like when... I got nothin'. Uh, let's just find that piece."
Bart,"Hey, remember that pet gerbil we used to have? He didn't run away after all."
Bart,Oh. Time to repress another memory.
Bart,I-am-at-Disneyland.
Bart,Disneyland!
Bart,"But you're not gonna get divorced like Milhouse's parents, are you?"
Bart,"Yeah, and along the way we took photos of interesting doors and gates."
Bart,"Hey, I love watching you guys fight. It's my earliest memory."
Bart,"Dad, your hands feel so soft."
Bart,"Oh, it shows! I haven't had a strangle that smooth since I was four."
Bart,Couldn't you just say you're sorry and not mean it? I do it all the time. I don't think I've ever meant it.
Bart,"Sorry, Mom. See, it's that easy!"
Bart,"Balloon ride, wax museum, the Denzel Washington monument, colonial Phoenix, hey, dude ranch!"
Bart,"And there's no radio or TV, so we won't have to hear your song!"
Bart,I'll show you how they get on a horse where I come from.
Bart,"Daddy, I need upsies!"
Bart,"Hey Crabby Hayes, get with the program!"
Bart,I thought you guys lived off the land. How come you're selling junk to jerks like us?
Bart,I'll save you!
Bart,"Hey, bottom bunk's mine."
Bart,They took the bait. Let's go.
Bart,"Let it go, Dad."
Bart,Don't-really-care-just-terribly-caught-up-in-moment!
Bart,"Who are you, the usedta police?"
Bart,"Hey beavers! Remember me, you buck-toothed nerds?"
Bart,"What's up, Cootie Breath?"
Bart,"Hey, let's see if Dad's song is finally off the air."
Bart,"Mr. Secretary, can you read the minutes of our last meeting?"
Bart,"Good. Security officer, anything on scope?"
Bart,If I understand the female mind -- and I do -- they're plotting against us.
Bart,"Lisa, this is your mother."
Bart,The doctor says your butt's too big!
Bart,Can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you?
Bart,"Hey, you passed the lumberyard."
Bart,Isn't this dangerous?
Bart,Gotcha.
Bart,"Oh, that's it. You are going down."
Bart,"Bumblebee-man, mi treehouse es su bee- house... Reverend, love the cassock... Moleman, lookin' good!..."
Bart,"Don't worry, boy. We'll get you out of the dog house. And then you and Dad'll be chasing butterflies together again."
Bart,"Dad, five minutes ago you hated him."
Bart,"Hey boy, this is your commercial!"
Bart,Who the hell are you?
Bart,"Dad, you can't let him take our dog!"
Bart,Who's gonna eat my homework now?
Bart,"Okay, boy. Fetch!"
Bart,What do you do for fun?
Bart,"Poor Santa's Little Helper, he's overworked."
Bart,But I miss him. He was my best friend.
Bart,"Hey, Duffman!"
Bart,"Here's how we're gonna get our dog back. Dad'll pretend to drown and call for ""Suds McDuff"" to save him."
Bart,Uh oh! Who will save that poor fat man?
Bart,"Oh, I missed you so much, boy."
Bart,"I think he left a ""big hug"" in your lunch box."
Bart,"If I could be any type of shark, I'd be a tiger shark. How 'bout you, Milhouse?"
Bart,"Okay, five more minutes and I'm chewing my hand off."
Bart,"Way to go, Dad!"
Bart,We touched hands and then we had to wash the cooties off.
Bart,Hey! I brought a Peruvian fighting frog!
Bart,I wanna saunter!
Bart,Saunter!
Bart,Saunter!
Bart,Except a place to live and free food.
Bart,"Hey, there's nothing wrong with that. I just wonder how they keep it so fresh after forty-three episodes."
Bart,They wrote all the songs on Maggie's baby records.
Bart,"Hey, I've got an idea. Let's tie a string around a fly."
Bart,"If they don't, I've wasted a lot of my life."
Bart,"Knowing you, you'd mess it up somehow."
Bart,The fly's stuck in Flanders' house!
Bart,There's no time. We're going in!
Bart,Let it go.
Bart,"Well, what do you know, cats eat flies."
Bart,"Dude, we're in Flanders' house -- unsupervised."
Bart,That is so gay.
Bart,These losers are out of peanut butter.
Bart,"Hey, I didn't get where I am putting tops on things."
Bart,"Wow, Mr. Flanders is really into the Beatles."
Bart,Who is he talking to?
Bart,A forty-year-old novelty beverage? Hand it over!
Bart,Yellow matter custard... dripping from a dead dog's eye...
Bart,Please don't call our parents!
Bart,"Hey, boys will be boys."
Bart,How come I'm not doing this stuff with Milhouse?
Bart,"Hey, Lazy Horse! Find us something cool to do."
Bart,"Wow Mom, I wish you were our tribe leader."
Bart,You haven't seen your dad in years.
Bart,Mohican? I thought you guys were all gone.
Bart,And why are we gonna do it?
Bart,Hey! Some jerks cleaned our field!
Bart,Cavalry Kids? That's pathetic.
Bart,"""We will crush you and smother your dreams. Yours in Christ, the Cavalry Kids."""
Bart,Candy for sale!
Bart,Get your un-poisoned candy!
Bart,"Well, that's it. They've beaten us."
Bart,It's on the back of our vests.
Bart,"After this prank, everyone's gonna hate those Cavalry Clods as much as we do."
Bart,Except to all of America's problems.
Bart,No.
Bart,"Man, the plant cut one!"
Bart,This is the best Year of the Rat ever!
Bart,You could be my father figure.
Bart,I can help you.
Bart,I'm helping Daddy!
Bart,"Lisa, it says one year and up."
Bart,"Good grief, this candy's terrible."
Bart,"Circus peanuts, raisins, nicotine gum, a library card... You got all good stuff!"
Bart,You thieving hussy!
Bart,Hey! / Ay carumba!
Bart,"Please, don't take me! Take Milhouse. We all know there's no happy ending there."
Bart,Cool.
Bart,"Oh man, these seats suck."
Bart,"Dad, were all those people on the list?"
Bart,And I thought Halle Berry went nuts during her acceptance speech.
Bart,"""Superman vs. Patty Hearst,"" ""Evel Knievel Jumps The Jackson 5,"" ""Batman and Rhoda""..."
Bart,Check out these ads!
Bart,Let's see... x-ray gum...
Bart,"Cool... Milhouse, do you have your change purse?"
Bart,"""To stop time, click watch."""
Bart,"Wow, she looks like a background character in a Hanna Barbera cartoon!"
Bart,"To restart time, click watch again."
Bart,"If we're both touching the watch, neither of us will be affected."
Bart,Do you realize what this means?
Bart,We can do anything we want!
Bart,That was close.
Bart,Milhouse! You broke the watch! Do you realize what this means?
Bart,"Oh, man. Things are stuck like this forever."
Bart,"Actually, I guess we can do anything we want... and no one will stop us."
Bart,No you're not.
Bart,Thanks. I just washed them.
Bart,That keeps happening.
Bart,Just keep it above the belt.
Bart,"You know, Milhouse? I thought I'd love eating only frosting and giving the Pope a wedgie..."
Bart,"But I miss being a regular kid in the real world, gettin' a hug from my Mom..."
Bart,All right. It says here we can learn watch repair in eight one-hour lessons.
Bart,"Boy, that took forever."
Bart,Here goes nothin'...
Bart,"Wait, when people see all the stuff we did, they're gonna want to kill us."
Bart,What we need is a scapegoat.
Bart,"Okay, acting natural aaand..."
Bart,Jealous much?
Bart,Woo hoo! Mom finally stopped caring!
Bart,Mom made the Oops Patrol! Hot damn!
Bart,"Don't drag me down with you, old man."
Bart,No.
Bart,This is boring. Can't we go home? This overpass smells like urine.
Bart,Fresh urine.
Bart,"I'll save you, Dad!"
Bart,Ka-ra-té!
Bart,Gramma!
Bart,Yes'm.
Bart,"Aww. So, why are you back in town?"
Bart,"If it please the court, I would like to go ape on my sister."
Bart,"Judge, sidebar?"
Bart,"Judge, do you have a little sister?"
Bart,"Thank you, your honor."
Bart,"Wah, wah, wah. Ain't I cute? You owe me a dirt bike."
Bart,You taught me a criminal can evade the law well into old age.
Bart,Then what was in the coffin?
Bart,"C'mon, big guy. This'll help you get to sleep."
Bart,"Bravo, Lisa. Bra-vo."
Bart,I was being sarcastic.
Bart,No. I was being sincere.
Bart,"Lis, Skinner is using you. Like a pawn on his unholy chess set."
Bart,LISA IS A FOOL!
Bart,"""All extra-curricular activities are hereby canceled, to be replaced by nothing."""
Bart,As ordered by Principal Skinner and approved by student body president Lisa Simpson!
Bart,WHAT THEY WANTED YOU TO.
Bart,BUT A TANGO TAKES TWO!
Bart,"Lis, you made this school even worse. And it wasn't exactly San Diego State to begin with."
Bart,"You do? Cool, a blank check for mayhem."
Bart,"Lisa is a nut. She has a rubber butt. Every time she turns around it goes ""putt putt."""
Bart,Hockey Dad rules! Feel the drunken wrath of Chuck Shadowski!
Bart,"Ignore, ignore!"
Bart,Umm... there's a ladybug in your hair.
Bart,Got it!
Bart,The best you'll ever have.
Bart,You'll rent nothing! This money is mine. I found it!
Bart,Let's see someone claim that money now.
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,Whose picture is on it?
Bart,Next!
Bart,Sweet! What am I gonna do with a thousand dollars?
Bart,No one's touching the hors d'oeuvres.
Bart,Great lady.
Bart,"Time's up. Beat it, doo-rags."
Bart,"Hm, this gives me an idea."
Bart,"Hey, I'm charging five bucks to get in. They deserve to see the boy behind the bill."
Bart,"You can't whitewash history, Lis."
Bart,"Prove it, Bony Curtis."
Bart,It's a perfect match!
Bart,"Finally, I can get what I've always wanted... a used Toyota."
Bart,"Well... okay. For Mom, I'll do it. Where should we go?"
Bart,Why are you greeting low-lifes like us at the airport?
Bart,"Look, teabag, just fork over the brown."
Bart,This is cool. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
Bart,Good luck!
Bart,"'E claimed he was me father, he did."
Bart,"Poke the monster with a stick! Tuppence a jab! C'mon, queue up, lads."
Bart,"Hey, Dad, why don't we try the ""Sprawl-Mart""?"
Bart,Dad!
Bart,An elephant's butt?
Bart,"Lis, your stupid present will only last a week. Mine will sit in a closet for years."
Bart,"Oh look, Jaclyn Smith has her own line of axe heads!"
Bart,Wow! It's a machine that makes carnival food at home.
Bart,"I'm gonna pour caramel on my clothes. And then, finally, I can eat my shorts."
Bart,"Dad, you got attacked by a bear?!"
Bart,"Yeah, we'd rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day."
Bart,Behold! The ultimate in anti-bear technology: The Bear Buster Five Thousand. Available wherever fat men dream.
Bart,You're sneakin' out to fight that bear. I wanna go too.
Bart,"Screw that. When I grow up, I'm legally changing my name to Joe Kickass."
Bart,Why don't you take a bath in the river? This bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago.
Bart,"Hey, the batteries are missing from this thing."
Bart,RUBBING STICKS TOGETHER MAKES THE SPARKS IGNITE / AND THE THOUGHT OF LOVING YOU IS GETTIN' SO EXCITING...
Bart,Mom! Mom! Stop the car!
Bart,Dad went to take a bath and the bear carried him off!
Bart,"Yeah, but now he's being attacked by an elephant."
Bart,No.
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Don't worry, I know just what to do."
Bart,"Hey mister, would you like a puppy?"
Bart,Okay.
Bart,Want a puppy?
Bart,"Well, you're still my hero."
Bart,"Cheer up, Krusty. You're a clue in the People Magazine crossword puzzle. What more can a man want?"
Bart,Why don't we ask your dad?
Bart,"Yes it is, you're a clown."
Bart,How do you know all this stuff?
Bart,"Krusty, that was a great show! Once I was clapping, and the applause sign wasn't even on!"
Bart,"I say live fast, die young, and leave a big fat corpse."
Bart,"Dad, you blew it. You listened to Lisa. And then you lost your stranglehold on the audience."
Bart,"Awesome! I'm blasting all the state capitals! Take that, Salem, Oregon!"
Bart,"Wait a minute, this game is educational!"
Bart,That'll teach you to teach me!
Bart,Can we get our big Christmas tree now?
Bart,I thought we had enough money for a good tree.
Bart,"Yeah, TV writers have been milkin' that goat for years."
Bart,Cool. Mr. Flanders gave me a Krusty brand Operation game.
Bart,What a great Christmas. Not even Moe's annual suicide attempt can ruin it.
Bart,Hey! I'm watchin' that!
Bart,I missed the feeding frenzy. I hope you're happy.
Bart,"Mom, that's Roofi. His music is why babies are idiots."
Bart,Why don't you let us watch TV and get her a Roofi CD?
Bart,Y-whay ot-nay? Ut-whay ould-cay o-gay ong-wray?
Bart,You don't understand -- I can't go home! You gotta give me detention. Look -- I fed the gerbil coffee!
Bart,"Please, make me write something on the chalkboard a thousand times!"
Bart,So does sucking on the dog.
Bart,"Mom, I locked your keys in the car."
Bart,"Also, Maggie puked in your purse again."
Bart,"Mom, can we get a pretzel?"
Bart,Not cinnamon.
Bart,"Lis, kids are the problem, maybe kids can be the solution."
Bart,"Hey, I'm the visionary. You come up with the nuts and bolts."
Bart,Don't you mean my most brilliant idea ever?
Bart,I know you have an ugly face.
Bart,Because we're kids. Kids! Maybe that's the answer.
Bart,Can I bring my laser pointer?
Bart,"Hey, Milhouse! Oh, what's this?"
Bart,"""Psycho Cycle Conversion Kit?!"" Oh, wow, this will look great on my bike."
Bart,"Flame decal for the chain guard, Marine Corps tassels... bullet-proof seat... and a rub-on tattoo for that ""special someone."""
Bart,Now to turn on the moto-mimic.
Bart,"Hey, give those back."
Bart,"Oh man, I sure wish I had a ten-speed bike."
Bart,"She said ""yes."""
Bart,"I see. So if my old bike didn't work, I would automatically get a new one?"
Bart,"Boy, I'm really gonna miss you. We've really had some great... Ooh, a Mercedes!"
Bart,Yes!
Bart,"My bike! My crappy, crappy bike."
Bart,"I know how you feel, Lis. No kid wants to outlive their pet."
Bart,"Can I, for true?"
Bart,"Dad, no! Think of the bike."
Bart,"Yeah, great workmanship."
Bart,"You actually did it! You're the coolest, Dad!"
Bart,Look what my Dad just built for me!
Bart,"Hey, guys! This butt's for you!"
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,I'm riding a unicycle with my pants down. This should be every boy's dream.
Bart,"Face it, you're not the most mechanical guy in the world. But you're good at other things: like... eating while driving. That's somethin'... and nobody gets madder at the news."
Bart,"Hey, it didn't fall apart."
Bart,Smash this six pack!
Bart,Awesome! I gotta tell Milhouse.
Bart,Ashes to ashes... dust to dust... we've gotta go fight some robots.
Bart,"C'mon, Homer. How long does it take to go to the bathroom?"
Bart,Huh?
Bart,Dear Bart...
Bart,"Well, I wish Homer was here."
Bart,But don't worry. I've got a name all picked out for you.
Bart,"Chief Knockahomer, let's win this one for Dad!"
Bart,...then Knockahomer did three victory laps and pretended to drink a beer!
Bart,"Dad, it was so great -- Knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!"
Bart,This robot's the greatest thing you've ever done for me. I can't believe you've never seen him fight.
Bart,"Well, the next match is Saturday. Can you come then?"
Bart,Our robot can kick that robot's ass! Right Dad? Dad?
Bart,Sure he's tough. But he's never come up against a wooden mallet!
Bart,You guys are just in time. My dad's about to tell me something important about our robot.
Bart,"Okay I've been studying Frink's robot, and I've discovered he has one small weak spot."
Bart,Uh-oh. His weak spot is now his strongest point.
Bart,That moan sounded almost human.
Bart,"I like you too, Dad."
Bart,"You look a little sluggish out there, boy. I'd better open you up."
Bart,Dad?!
Bart,"So, you fought all those robots?"
Bart,That is so cool!
Bart,"Yeah! Any Poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life, even though you're the sole provider for a family of five! I am the luckiest kid in the world."
Bart,Oh no! Dad!
Bart,Go! Go! Go! Now's your chance!
Bart,Why did you make it do that?
Bart,"Well, you did disappear a lot, but I have gone whole summers without seeing you."
Bart,I'm gonna taunt the Ph.D's.
Bart,"Hey guys, I heard an assistant professorship just opened up!"
Bart,At the University of... psyche!
Bart,"Hey, I think it's cool. I can defibrillate Lisa!"
Bart,"Dad, you've been driving in circles for twenty minutes."
Bart,He'll never read it.
Bart,He'll never see it.
Bart,We're doomed.
Bart,Oh yeah. How does that go again?
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,Oh c'mon. Can't we at least have one pity scalp?
Bart,"What is that, a quarter?"
Bart,I'unno. The boogeyman?
Bart,"Mom, everyone who ever lived is boring."
Bart,"I know there's a catch, but tell me more."
Bart,"Hey, that wasn't me, that was Milhouse?"
Bart,"Wander away from the group? Man, you've been huffin' from the Bart bag."
Bart,"Milhouse, why are you acting so crazy? Did your imaginary friend try to kill you again?"
Bart,"Well, if it's not easy, don't do it. That's how I got where I am."
Bart,You mean up until now you did care? Then why did you wear that tutu to school last week?
Bart,"TV sure has come a long way, huh Milhouse?"
Bart,What?
Bart,"Capital City? You can't move that far, you're my best friend. What's your Mom making? I'll match it!"
Bart,Nooo!
Bart,Tell me about it.
Bart,You mean Milhouse? Funny little guy. Afraid of the dark. And the light. Now I got new friends. Guys who get me.
Bart,There's one right now.
Bart,It is not Ralph.
Bart,Just get in here.
Bart,"Ralph, we're playing checkers."
Bart,"Oh, fine."
Bart,I never thought I'd have to take a plane to see Milhouse.
Bart,Milhouse? Is that you?
Bart,"Uh, maybe later."
Bart,"Milhouse, this isn't you."
Bart,No way!
Bart,Outside? That's where me and Milhouse played.
Bart,"Hey, Moldilocks. Mom says I'm supposed to help you."
Bart,"Lis, you are so dead."
Bart,"I'm gonna hit you so hard, I'll kill your whole family."
Bart,Shut up!
Bart,All right.
Bart,Sure we can. But let me go first. Everyone knows you're the future of this family.
Bart,Geronimo!
Bart,Just forget everything you know about gravity.
Bart,Just do it.
Bart,"Or like when I discovered the school's Xerox code. One, four, seven. Just sayin' it makes my butt feel warm again."
Bart,Arrowheads!
Bart,Look! He's pickin' his nose.
Bart,"Okay, shake."
Bart,Psyche!
Bart,That's what you call commitment to a bit.
Bart,Thank God we've come to our senses and worship a carpenter who lived two thousand years ago.
Bart,"Oh, that does sound fun."
Bart,But not today. I think I'm just gonna hang out at home.
Bart,One time I swung all the way around.
Bart,I know a guy who did.
Bart,You don't know him. He lives in Russia.
Bart,I knew you'd blow it. Now let me show you that mound.
Bart,"Hey, he's my best friend."
Bart,Great. Then we're all cool.
Bart,"Since he's been back, Milhouse has had three bloody noses and stepped in dog doo. It's always a party with that guy."
Bart,"You should hang with us sometime, Lis."
Bart,What's wrong?
Bart,What're you talkin' about?
Bart,"Hey Lis, you wanna play Cap City Monopoly?"
Bart,"Oh c'mon, I'll roll the dice for you."
Bart,"...three, four, five, chance. Pick up a card."
Bart,Yep. Pick up another one.
Bart,"I'm trying to do something nice, you dink. Pick up a card."
Bart,"Trust me, that is a valuable card. Pick up another."
Bart,"Just because I have Milhouse back, doesn't mean I haven't learned a few things about being a brother."
Bart,"Aw, do I have to?"
Bart,"All yours, Homer."
Bart,"Didn't have to, I'm a dude."
Bart,"Hey, my-my pants aren't down!"
Bart,This place looks familiar.
Bart,Did we ever turn off that shower nozzle?
Bart,Yay!
Bart,"Go, Maggie!"
Bart,"Welcome to ""The Others."""
Bart,"Hey, I'm jealous of her, too. When you're a baby, you spend all day just rollin' around on the floor. Boy, I miss that."
Bart,Maggie! The red button... Hit the red button!
Bart,Maggie! Press the red button!
Bart,But they stretched out the plot and added a wildebeest... from the hood!
Bart,Refresh my memory. These dweebs are with us why?
Bart,"I think you're on your own, toots!"
Bart,Say no more.
Bart,"Come on, Dad. With his brains and your musky smell, I've got a full male role model."
Bart,"Hey, Mom. Can I sleep over at Milhouse's?"
Bart,"Yeah, but after the ice cream man cut up his credit card, he got a little depressed."
Bart,"Hey, let me read it to her. ""Johnny's friends get some payback on daddy while he's sleeping..."""
Bart,Daddy's on fire. Daddy's not on fire. Daddy's on fire. Daddy's not on fire. Daddy's on fire...
Bart,"Hey Dad, maybe this'll cheer you up. Why you little..."
Bart,And I'm happy to listen to F.M. ninety-five point three. Home of Boomer and the Diz!
Bart,"Chill out, Mom. They gave me this hat."
Bart,Amendments? Regulatory agencies? What the fark-bot?
Bart,"Whoa, mama. Finally, some action!"
Bart,That sucked!
Bart,"I feel so ripped off by that crappy movie, I'm gonna chip a big hole in the floor."
Bart,"A letter, huh? Okay Lis, get this down."
Bart,"Dear Randall Curtis, your movie stunk smelly butt. I am fine. Sincerely..."
Bart,We're gonna have to track Randall Curtis down and make him listen to us.
Bart,But the bread's still dancing!
Bart,And we're here to tell you that your movies have lost their way.
Bart,"Wait, before you have us killed, hear us out."
Bart,"Well, we've learned if you don't like something, just go to the office and complain. What's our next stop?"
Bart,Mom's not gonna like this.
Bart,"Hey, as long as they're not hurting anybody."
Bart,Why are your keys in my scrambled eggs?
Bart,"Cool, guns."
Bart,"Die, happy couples--"
Bart,Bull-honky.
Bart,Wow.
Bart,Name of groom...
Bart,"Bart Simpson. ""Name of bride..."" Lotta Cooties."
Bart,"Yeah, I'm gonna scam this town out of so many presents. And what I don't use, I'm gonna return... for store credit!"
Bart,This prank is my Sergeant Pepper's.
Bart,Yes.
Bart,"C'mon Chief, it was just a prank. Would some flatware make things right?"
Bart,"Juvie?! Please Judge, you can't... I-I'll do anything! I'll squeal on my dad -- he's been up to bad things. Crap you'VE never even thought of."
Bart,These are all fast food jobs.
Bart,"Ah, cartoons, America's only native art form. I don't count jazz, 'cause it sucks."
Bart,I've lost everything I loved.
Bart,"Okay, if I use my head, I can keep out of trouble. Better stay out of the sandbox... I could be buried alive... Maybe the slide..."
Bart,I'll just hang out next to girls' juvie.
Bart,"Hello, ladies."
Bart,I hate this place! It's nothing like the brochure.
Bart,"It's horrible in here -- the boys beat me up, the girls beat me up..."
Bart,That's my doll!
Bart,Dad?!
Bart,"Not so tough now, huh?"
Bart,"Uh, this lollipop's really for everybody."
Bart,"Don't worry, you won't."
Bart,I'm gettin' out in two weeks. Why would I want to break out with you?
Bart,"Well, you do look pretty in the moonlight."
Bart,Hey guards! Help! Help!
Bart,Why'd you kiss me? Are you lookin' to do the Bartman?
Bart,Yeah? Why would they believe you?
Bart,But you've got twenty pounds on me!
Bart,I'm screwed.
Bart,But I have to wizzle.
Bart,I miss prison.
Bart,So why'd they send you to juvie? Shoplift a scrunchie?
Bart,Oh man. Did she live?
Bart,"Gina, before we get any closer, there's something you need to know about me. I think girls are icky-pants."
Bart,Great. I can get these handcuffs off before I get a full-blown case of the cooties.
Bart,But State Farm took my money!
Bart,"When we split up, where are you gonna go?"
Bart,"Wow, your parents are cool!"
Bart,"Oh man, there's a line."
Bart,"Hey, the next time my Mom asks me to help around the house, I could come live with your family."
Bart,That girl's nuts... First she likes me then she hates me... I've already forgotten how ugly she is. I'd better eyeball that ape one more time.
Bart,What's up? Don't you want to get back to that awesome family of yours?
Bart,What are you crying about? How cool they are?
Bart,"Oh, I know you're sad now, but surely your incredible family will cheer you up."
Bart,Wait... do you even have a family?
Bart,I understand.
Bart,You're such a psycho!
Bart,Future skank!
Bart,I thought you might want to have a nice family dinner.
Bart,It's the World Series of Kickball... Bart Simpson on the mound. The catcher gives him the signal...and here's the pitch!
Bart,"Way to go, Mrs. K! You finally hooked the Skinfish!"
Bart,"We have the same dream, ma'am."
Bart,Cowabunga One to Fat Load.
Bart,Denied.
Bart,Here comes the bride. Repeat. Here comes the bride.
Bart,"We got a runner. Snipers, take your shot."
Bart,"Mom, what are you doin' here? Did our house burn down? Whoa, that'd be cool."
Bart,The what now?
Bart,UH-PLEE-EE-EE-EEASE / SETTLE FOR SEYMOUR / SO PLEE-EE-EE-EEASE COME BACK TO THE DORK
Bart,It's your fault for giving birth to my arch-enemy!
Bart,The Bi-Mon Sci-Fi Con?!
Bart,"Hey, women have put out just to get out of there."
Bart,Look -- there they are!
Bart,Why are you dressed like Catwoman?
Bart,Welcome to lecture number eight on the water balloon. Yesterday I asked everyone to think of other liquids you could fill a balloon with.
Bart,"Thank you, Nelson. Anyone else?"
Bart,"Kearney, that could blind someone. You get an ""A."""
Bart,"Now, for a practical demonstration. First we load the ordnance...then select the target."
Bart,"Hmm, not Otto -- he'd drive us off a cliff."
Bart,Bingo.
Bart,"Please don't make us go. If you make me get on that plane, I'll give myself diarrhea! I know how!"
Bart,"What is your deal, anyway?"
Bart,Hm.
Bart,"A chick flick? Say it ain't so, Ho!"
Bart,Like what? They'll do something with you that they hate?
Bart,I say bury her before she starts to smell.
Bart,The man asked a question.
Bart,Lisa made me! With a witch's spell!
Bart,Wicca's a Hollywood fad!
Bart,You're never alone in this crapshack!
Bart,They might not be dead -- they could be in the basement!
Bart,"We're not enough fun for them? Well, I know how to find out where they are."
Bart,You'll love it -- it's full of sexy old widows who don't want to die alone.
Bart,First let's slap on some Band-Aids so they feel really bad for ditching us.
Bart,We have a free hotel room in Miami for two days?
Bart,And I have a card that can take us anywhere they go.
Bart,"I understand... Hey, what's that crazy girl doin'?"
Bart,"So, Mom and Dad are going to Atlantic City...but their luggage isn't. And Homer's getting the low-fat meal."
Bart,You guys lied to us!
Bart,"Yeah, it's a tissue... covered in blood and boogers!"
Bart,Those days are over! Give it up!
Bart,Great! What do you wanna play?
Bart,"Lis, you awake?"
Bart,"Yeah, I agree. I mean, you are pretty annoying."
Bart,"Hey, I just zinged you."
Bart,"I'm grown up, I'm grown up!"
Bart,"What did those women expect? When you sign a contract with Fox, you know you're gonna be betrayed and humiliated."
Bart,Eww.
Bart,Place-setting? How is someone so lame related to a hot tamale like me?
Bart,"Dad, I feel like I'm gonna throw up."
Bart,Comic Book Guy made me pay for these comics he said I smudged. But I didn't even touch 'em!
Bart,He was just trying to unload these crappy comics on a helpless kid.
Bart,"There's a note! ""Evildoers beware! Signed, Simple Simon, your friendly neighborhood Pie Man."""
Bart,"C'mon, Pie Man, hit him! That's the only reason anyone came to this stupid thing!"
Bart,"And wherever Pie Man is, the Cupcake Kid will not be far behind."
Bart,"Because I'm ""it."""
Bart,"Now, whoever finishes first gets a lemonade..."
Bart,...for me.
Bart,Uh-oh. Girls. You guys need your cootie shots.
Bart,"Okay, ladies. Don't you have a poodle to dress up?"
Bart,I wouldn't mind pushin' that in the mud.
Bart,What the hell's that?
Bart,Do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son's little league team?
Bart,"Homer, I'll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers, kissin' girls and tippin' dinosaurs."
Bart,"Let me get this straight. When you were my age, you had the hots for Mom and didn't even know it? That's cool. Or is it lame? I guess I'll go with lame. You're lame."
Bart,I've kissed three girls.
Bart,Leslie who?
Bart,We've heard the same story two times now. Whose side are we gonna hear next? The Sea Captain's?
Bart,"Way to go, Dad!"
Bart,"Face it, Lis -- men are dogs. The worse we treat you, the more you want us."
Bart,"Ha ha! You said ""dog doo""!"
Bart,"What are you doing? If they fight in front of us, we might get new bikes!"
Bart,I am!
Bart,"You're right, this is it. They're selling us to be crash test dummies."
Bart,It's shot day!
Bart,Karaté!
Bart,No thanks. I already helped myself.
Bart,"See ya later, inoculator!"
Bart,"Don't feel bad, Doc. I won't even let my Mom clip my toenails."
Bart,"Whoa, something's wrong! Ah, ah, I can't hear!"
Bart,"Hey, fellas! My hearing's back."
Bart,But Mom... tomorrow's the big donkey basketball game.
Bart,The kids are gonna play the teachers!
Bart,Donkey Basketball? Now I've heard everything! Unlike you!
Bart,"Hey, donkey, want a carrot?"
Bart,Psyche!
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Thank you. And let me say I missed your sweet, sweet voices."
Bart,"Look, what should I say to make people not hate me?"
Bart,"Dad, I am going on a talk show. I have to say something!"
Bart,But I don't hate this country.
Bart,"Nash, I've realized something. I'm the worst kid in the world, and the last thing I deserve is forgiveness. But with a little help from Jesus and our fighting men and women overseas--"
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Well, where do you think we are?"
Bart,"AMERICANS ARE / BRAVE AND LOYAL / SO C'MON JERKS, GIVE US YOUR OIL..."
Bart,"Dad, why are you still singing that stupid song?"
Bart,No.
Bart,"Well, at least some good came out of today."
Bart,I'll just pay the fine.
Bart,You better -- I've already sold a bunch of subscriptions. How do you think I got these swell prizes!
Bart,Check it out. Principal Skinrash.
Bart,"Snot a problem, Chief."
Bart,"Sure thing, Jerk."
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,Take the sob sister act somewhere else -- you're standin' in my light!
Bart,"Lis, I've learned a valuable lesson here: the pen is mightier than the flaming bag of poop."
Bart,Am I the only one here who's in horrible pain?
Bart,Cool! I'm vomit.
Bart,Wait a minute. I don't have a family anymore!
Bart,"In this neighborhood, who hasn't?"
Bart,Security!
Bart,Takin' a whiz.
Bart,Learning is cool!
Bart,"Mom, did you have to fly out through all those boogers?"
Bart,There's an open house next door. They're giving out cookies and business cards!
Bart,"Check it out, I'm a business jerk!"
Bart,Whoa -- Playdudes!
Bart,I gotta be honest -- I don't see what all the hubbub is about.
Bart,That's Congresswoman Bella Abzug.
Bart,The grown-ups in this magazine are pretty cool.
Bart,"I could make the treehouse look like this. Then we could have orgies, whatever they are."
Bart,What's the first thing you're gonna make in your new kitchen?
Bart,"Well, the Playdude Advisor says this music will get a stewardess to give you a layover."
Bart,"Outtasight! Lay it on me, Mama."
Bart,"It's dessert, but it's hot dogs, so it's good for you!"
Bart,"Ah Nelson, your debonair wit reminds me of a young Mort Sahl."
Bart,"Listen up, ring-a-ding-dingers. I'm throwin' a little sip 'n' quip at the Playdude Treehouse. Saturday night, at the top of the ladder. Be there or be square."
Bart,You're not invited.
Bart,"Great licks man, great licks."
Bart,"Hey, it wouldn't be a Playdude party without James Caan."
Bart,"I don't, but I hope you win."
Bart,Canned and frozen juices are more popular than ever these days. But most bachelors we know would prefer to squeeze their own tomatoes.
Bart,"I'm just spreadin' the Playdude philosophy. Hi-fi's, Norman Mailer, gettin' some..."
Bart,Uh... toys?
Bart,Oh yeah.
Bart,Because we're poor?
Bart,And then the man...
Bart,Not if you knew what he's been doing.
Bart,Party! Party! Party! Party!
Bart,"Check it out, Homes. You said if I ever got a hundred on a test, you'd throw me a party."
Bart,There's my hundred -- where's my party?
Bart,"Nope, it's real -- check out the watermark."
Bart,"See, it's all legit. Now make with the party."
Bart,I win! P-A-R-T. Par-tee!
Bart,Oh boy! Barty's gonna party!
Bart,"Oh Mom, this guest list sucks."
Bart,Where's Milhouse?
Bart,"Say ""goose,"" you stupid freak!"
Bart,"Mom, this was the worst party ever."
Bart,"Mom, after that lame party you threw, I'd rather hang out with thunder-thighs here."
Bart,"Mom, when I want lame and needy, I'll call Milhouse. No offense."
Bart,"Lis, look!"
Bart,My mother... my bully... my God!
Bart,What are you doing in my jammies?
Bart,But it's a single bed.
Bart,"Mom, the reason God invented deadbolts is to keep people like Nelson out of your house."
Bart,I'm not hungry.
Bart,I've gotta do something about him.
Bart,"Well, at least she's not singing Streisand."
Bart,...and that's where I found him.
Bart,I brought him back here so he could take Nelson away and my bruises would heal.
Bart,"So, now that you're happy again, I guess you won't beat me up at school anymore."
Bart,"C'mon, boy. Take your pill."
Bart,"Mom, the dog won't take his medicine!"
Bart,I didn't think anyone successful came from Springfield.
Bart,"Mayah Quimby is my er ah, fathah. Give me one million dollahs!"
Bart,This isn't what it looks like.
Bart,Thinking is for losers!
Bart,Thanks for cushioning my fall.
Bart,What did I do?
Bart,"Mom, I wanna be just like you. I mean the lava part, not saving Lisa."
Bart,I'm using your unfinished novel!
Bart,There's no cut on your cheek...
Bart,Where'd the blood come from?
Bart,"Hey, I got a loose tooth."
Bart,"Of course I can twist it, I'm great."
Bart,This is my last baby tooth.
Bart,Then let's hurry up and rip it out of my head.
Bart,No problem.
Bart,Um-huh.
Bart,"God, please give your daughter the Tooth Fairy the strength to carry my cash, and the integrity not to dip her wand in the till."
Bart,What the?!
Bart,The Tooth Fairy has made a donation in my name to the ­United Way?! That gossamer witch.
Bart,I'm not gonna grow up!
Bart,I thought it was chocolate milk!
Bart,Nooo!
Bart,"I'm still a kid. And what do kids love? Kid stuff, like this."
Bart,"Vroom vroom. Vroom vroom... Vroom, vroom."
Bart,That I'm not a kid anymore.
Bart,"Well, there's one thing no one can take away: my childlike imagination."
Bart,"Sergeant Activity, your mission is to scale the icy walls of Mount Bloodkill!"
Bart,What's happening to me? Maybe I'm not a kid anymore.
Bart,"Goodbye, Spirogram. Goodbye, Sketch 'n' Etch. Goodbye Ravenous Ravenous Rhinos, Duopoly, Parchoosey, Humor Putty and Sock 'em Knock 'em Cyborgs. Goodbye, childhood."
Bart,"Goodbye, friends."
Bart,"Hey, Sea Captain."
Bart,I really don't want to talk about it.
Bart,"Thanks, but--"
Bart,"Lis, I think I'm having a midlife crisis."
Bart,"Or, I could write something that's not gay."
Bart,Um-hmm.
Bart,Leave me alone -- this expresses my rage at the machine.
Bart,Forget it. My attitude isn't for sale! What am I saying? Of course it is!
Bart,"T-shirts! Get your sassy T-shirts! Fifty percent cotton, one hundred percent awesome!"
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,"Come on, Chief. I can't afford to pay protection to you and Nelson."
Bart,It's no fair -- I just started and I'm out of business.
Bart,But I'm just a kid.
Bart,"Hey, you're right, I am."
Bart,So how can I get my shirts in stores?
Bart,That's right -- it's tomorrow!
Bart,T-shirts! Come order my homemade T-shirts. My Mom thinks they're good.
Bart,Hey!
Bart,"That sucked. Well, at least I've still got my health."
Bart,Of Goose's Gags and Gifts?
Bart,You really think my shirts will sell?
Bart,It's Goose!
Bart,Ooh!
Bart,How much?
Bart,Here's fifty.
Bart,"That's your donut money too, mister!"
Bart,"Dad, the bill's only a hundred."
Bart,How many T-shirts do you have here?
Bart,Really? How much money do I get?
Bart,Goose Gladwell ripped me off and there's nothin' I can do about it. I'm just a stupid kid.
Bart,"Thanks, Dad."
Bart,Are you sure that thing could really explode?
Bart,There's more than one way to lose a tooth.
Bart,"Hey, idiot. You're fat, and your Mom's naked on the internet. You also smell."
Bart,"Lis, Mr. Burns is the sweetest, kindest man I know."
Bart,Basically him and Dad.
Bart,"My Dad, the drug mule."
Bart,"All right, Dad!"
Bart,Thinner... thinner... thinner... thinner... too thin.
Bart,"Better luck next time, ""Tommy - Virginia Beach."""
Bart,You ate meat! You ate meat!
Bart,"Dad, Mom's spending more time at Moe's than you are."
Bart,Where's Mom going with Uncle Moe?
Bart,"Sure, why not."
Bart,"Uh, Mom? Looks like someone beat you to it."
Bart,Yes!
Bart,"Check it out, Fat-wad! I'm better than you, and I'm only ten!"
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,The running back for the San Antonio Cow Skulls?!
Bart,And sexy. King David stole someone else's wife... Mary Magdalene was a hooker...
Bart,It's all in this book.
Bart,"Wow, all these people are gonna see Dad's show."
Bart,Alcatraaaz is wide spread! I'm talkin' da junk!
Bart,So? You like the blues.
Bart,"Yes, but the blues are unpopular."
Bart,"Man, are you illin'."
Bart,I'm keepin' it real.
Bart,"Mom, Lisa's dissin' me!"
Bart,"Dad, can I go to a rap concert? Tickets are fifty dollars."
Bart,"Okay, what if I pay for it myself?"
Bart,"I love you, Dad."
Bart,"Hell yeah! I'm representin' at ""Murder 4 Life,"" know what I'm sayin'?"
Bart,"Step off, Mom. Rap is the poetry of the streets."
Bart,But Dad already said I could go!
Bart,But you said I could go if I paid for the ticket!
Bart,"Dad, you completely sold me out!"
Bart,"Well, I paid for this ticket. That makes me an adult. I'm going."
Bart,"I love you, Krusty-wusty."
Bart,"YOU CAN TRACE MY REMORSE TO ITS SUPER-SIZED SOURCE / A HUNGRY, HUNGRY HYPOCRITE NAMED HOMER OF COURSE / MY OLD MAN'S PATHETIC / DAMN IS HIS HEAD THICK / THE GAS FROM HIS ASS IS CARCINOGENIC / EVERY DAY I PRAY HIS DNA AIN'T GENETIC"
Bart,"Damn, this ride is pimped-out."
Bart,Jeepers! It's 50 Cent!
Bart,"Sorry, Fiddy. I have school tomorrow."
Bart,"Well, time to face my punishment like a man... Or, lie my way out of it like a kid."
Bart,I still do.
Bart,"Well... some kidnappers might be after me. It's a big world. But in this case, I faked the whole thing."
Bart,"No, it's not about you."
Bart,"Look, I need a place to hide out 'til the heat is off."
Bart,"No, no, I mean..."
Bart,This is the kidnapper.
Bart,Do what I say and Bart won't get hurt.
Bart,"Mom, it's me. Don't cry, I'm okay."
Bart,The kidnappers say if you worry too much... they'll kill me.
Bart,Gotta go!
Bart,"Uh, Chief... is Milhouse's Dad gonna be in trouble? He's not really a bad guy."
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Milhouse, if you tell anyone, I'll tell the world you wet your pants watching Harry Potter."
Bart,"Look, if you tell what I did, I'll get in trouble."
Bart,"Commissioner Wiggum, I need to confess something."
Bart,I lied about being kidnapped. The whole thing was a hoax.
Bart,But... what about Milhouse's Dad?
Bart,"People, please. The only way Lisa can bust me is if she finds someone who can prove I was at that rap show. And I know just where she can find that someone. Let's go cover our asses!"
Bart,HOMER IS A FAT LOAD!
Bart,Wait a minute. Why do we have to come clean? Nobody's been hurt. Everyone's happier with the lie.
Bart,"That's a very noble sentiment, Lisa. But for once in your life, can't you just be cool?"
Bart,"Some sucker will think he's getting beer, but he's really gonna get a face full of melon!"
Bart,Shhh. Don't ruin the moment.
Bart,Everyone in town is wise to us. We need someone new we can prank.
Bart,Sweet. Fresh meat.
Bart,We can show you around. If you don't mind a heapin' helpin' of local color.
Bart,That means it's a place where we do radio... activities.
Bart,I don't think we'll be hearing from him again.
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Well, all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn."
Bart,Is this one of those reality deals where a guy gets a million bucks for marrying Aunt Patty? But they have to honeymoon in a box full of snakes?
Bart,"As opposed to you, who grabbed the first blimp that floated by."
Bart,"Seriously Dad, I'm worried. You should go on a diet."
Bart,Gay wedding. But I can get you in.
Bart,"No, cash."
Bart,Why?
Bart,"So, Lis, ready for your trip?"
Bart,See ya next fall.
Bart,"Eh, you work in the business as long as I have, you're bound to repeat yourself."
Bart,See you next fall!
Bart,They left a message right here.
Bart,Feel free to make a rubbing.
Bart,The only gas is coming from Lisa's butt!
Bart,Check it out -- that frog has a nerd on its butt!
Bart,"Hey, there's a dog in the next car lookin' at me. Hey, dog."
Bart,"What are you gonna do, tell Mom and Dad? They're powerless figureheads."
Bart,"Good morning, world! Eat my shorts!"
Bart,Restraining order?! Bull spit! No piece of paper keeps me from whaling on my sister.
Bart,"Yes, Chief Wiggum."
Bart,How am I supposed to know if I'm twenty feet away?
Bart,"Homer, why did you put the screwdriver at the end?"
Bart,"Well, I've never been one to break the law..."
Bart,"So long, Seymour. Gimme a jingle sometime."
Bart,No... you don't mean...
Bart,"Oh, this place smells, and something's dripping on me."
Bart,But we're already on chapter seven.
Bart,"I can't take it anymore! Every time I try to relax, she-- ow, my neck!"
Bart,Can't I even finish my milk?
Bart,My sister has no sense of humor. I'm sure you understand. It's why you became a judge instead of finding a husband.
Bart,"What is he, blind and deaf?"
Bart,"It's pretty scary out here, Dad. Dad?"
Bart,"Well, I bet they miss me."
Bart,"Well, could be worse."
Bart,Why should I go inside? The world is my toilet now.
Bart,"Lis, just let me be!"
Bart,Look in your heart. I'm beggin' ya. Look in your heart.
Bart,What does that mean? You're sharpening it?
Bart,Look in your heart. I'm beggin' ya. Look in your heart.
Bart,Are you putting feces on the tip?
Bart,"Oh... uh... yeah. When you're right, you're right. Let's eat."
Bart,"Well, you see... the fire represents... your musical ability?"
Bart,Lisa... you just poked my feelings. I'm sorry too.
Bart,And a fight breaks out!
Bart,Car!
Bart,What the hell's menopause?
Bart,"We understand, ma'am. We're pretty lousy kids."
Bart,"Oh yeah, it's great. Why don't we top it off by reading to old people?"
Bart,How did Dad get out of this snooze cruise?
Bart,Time to open the envelope I gave you.
Bart,I'm on it.
Bart,Budget-O's?
Bart,You mean when the big tuna goes belly-up?
Bart,"I see. You were mad enough to leave our house, but not mad enough to leave our property? That's my half-assed Dad!"
Bart,You can have it -- this one's way better.
Bart,You're a bread compartment!
Bart,"Oh, do we have to?"
Bart,"Boy, they're really going at it. Do you think they're gonna get divorced?"
Bart,You know what started all this trouble? This motor home. How could a vehicle this cool destroy a marriage that crappy?
Bart,Take this back to the dealer?
Bart,"Slowly, slowly -- the RV dealer is across town under that gorilla blimp."
Bart,Duh! It's Kamper Kong.
Bart,We're on the freeway!
Bart,Prove it!
Bart,Not good enough! Kiss!
Bart,"French it up, lover boy!"
Bart,"First, raise my allowance."
Bart,Help us!
Bart,"Play?! All plays suck, all the time, and always will, and everyone knows it!"
Bart,I'd rather follow the dog. I think he's up to something.
Bart,Snowball II has another family!
Bart,Now she just bottles up her misery like a normal mom!
Bart,Only one way to find out.
Bart,My baby turtle crawled into your basement window.
Bart,"Uh... apron, boobs-face?"
Bart,"Uh... shoes, butt-back?"
Bart,"Thanks, Mother Dexter! I'll be back tomorrow."
Bart,"Lis, that place is great! They have a jukebox in the basement! And look at the trick they taught me!"
Bart,Are you watching? Are you watching?
Bart,"No Dad, you fell asleep in front of the TV watching ""The Towering Inferno."""
Bart,"Hey Lis, there's your boyfriend."
Bart,"Yeah, well you love Moleman."
Bart,You're gay for Moleman!
Bart,You're gay for Moleman!
Bart,No.
Bart,"Hey Jenda, how 'bout some forehead?"
Bart,I'm tired of this. I wanna look at a different future.
Bart,Meh.
Bart,Oh! Now I have to start over.
Bart,"Well, I guess an intensive four-year bachelor of arts program is the easiest way to get Jenda back."
Bart,"Hey, I didn't do anything! Yet."
Bart,"Hey, what can I say. I love learning."
Bart,And my brain is put in a...
Bart,But what happens to our parents?
Bart,"Oh, this sucks. I want to see Vice-President Cletus."
Bart,"I was gonna have my classmates over for a homework party, but now my refreshments are ruined."
Bart,"Goodbye, college!"
Bart,"Eh, I got standards. I don't hand out high-fives like Chiclets."
Bart,Zing!
Bart,Keep my dog? Till when?
Bart,"Hey Dad, remember when you said if I used a chainsaw unsupervised I'd hurt myself? Well, you were wrong. I hurt someone else."
Bart,"No I didn't, Dad."
Bart,I saw you talking to yourself.
Bart,"When you're gettin' juiced, can you hold my turtle? I wanna bring him back to life."
Bart,I'unno. He was dead when I found him.
Bart,Fine and dandy?
Bart,So do I.
Bart,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. How come at Builder's Barn I saw Homer talking to thin air?"
Bart,"Oh, I'm outta money! Willie! You wanna buy my skateboard?"
Bart,No thanks -- the vending machines at school feed me now.
Bart,My heart! It hurts so much! Like it's caught in a vice!
Bart,"Yeah, but what does not kill me makes me stronger. Wow, that was a lot of words -- I need some energy."
Bart,Ko-ta-hay cheese?
Bart,"Yuck. From the looks of it, this cheese has already been eaten."
Bart,"Okay Mom, for you, I'll try."
Bart,Where are you really going?
Bart,What the family?!
Bart,"Thank you, Krusty. Once again you've delivered an important message wrapped in entertainment. And I'm so touched that all of you would take the time to eat my shorts, lame-o's!"
Bart,Help! Kidnappers!
Bart,I'm not fat!
Bart,"Bart Simpson, I'm just big-boned."
Bart,Growth spurt?
Bart,This can't be legal!
Bart,"Look, I'm really, really sorry. Now let me get that ice cream off your shoe."
Bart,Can I just...?
Bart,German backpackers?
Bart,"They can't see or hear us, right?"
Bart,"Oh, my God."
Bart,"Oh, this is all my fault. I'll never eat junk food again. I swear!"
Bart,"I'm ending your vending, Dog."
Bart,I learned my lesson -- Mr. Spangler showed me the true cost of my junk food addiction.
Bart,Not for long -- I'm saying goodbye to Scammer and Z-Dog. I've learned that even made-up corporate shills can lie to you.
Bart,"When I raged against the machine, money poured out."
Bart,I feel like something crawled inside me and took a crap.
Bart,"No fair, Lisa didn't get sick."
Bart,"Yeah, 'cause we're through with vegetables. From now on, I'm only eating food that I know had a soul."
Bart,"Lisa, you should enter that contest. You've got a great voice. It made us all feel better."
Bart,I think I puked up all of my meanness.
Bart,Praise the Lord! I'm on the road to recovery.
Bart,"Lis, you're a shoo-in."
Bart,Why? Just because she sings like Whitney Houston brought to life?
Bart,"Yeah. For once, couldn't you just turn into a good father? Would that be so hard?"
Bart,"Hell, I'll even go shoe shopping."
Bart,"So, are you a Colonel or a Captain?"
Bart,What the Hell?
Bart,Whoa!
Bart,"What Lisa's trying to say is... there's a new kids' barbershop in the mall, and we'd like to start going there."
Bart,Left! Right! Stab! Stab! Stab!
Bart,My bad-boy spikes!
Bart,"It's all right, Lisa. Don't go. More Heaven for me."
Bart,"Yeah, school."
Bart,Instead of video games they have weird free newspapers.
Bart,"Mom, am I a ""butch"" or a ""fem""?"
Bart,"Mom, I don't wanna read -- it's the weekend!"
Bart,I was so bored I cut the ponytail off the guy sittin' in front of us.
Bart,"Look at me, I'm a grad student. I'm thirty years old and I made six hundred dollars last year."
Bart,I know what we can ask Jeeves -- why does he suck?
Bart,Sexy Slumber Party dot com?
Bart,"Hey, this is one of those dirty websites."
Bart,You heard nothing!
Bart,"Dad, look who's in there!"
Bart,"C'mon, Dad. I've seen you hit the toilet from here."
Bart,No problem-o.
Bart,This is so humiliating.
Bart,I submit! I submit!
Bart,Can't we just keep going forward in our textbooks?
Bart,What'm I gonna be? Black knight? Court ninja? Bart the Impaler?
Bart,What kind of a knight is that?
Bart,Ay carumba.
Bart,"Well, this stinks. But I bet Lisa got something even stupider."
Bart,"You'll pay for this, my Queen."
Bart,Milhouse! Don't open your mouth!
Bart,"Nice party, dink."
Bart,"No way! I didn't do it! Unlike all the other stuff I told you I didn't do, which I did!"
Bart,"I didn't do it! Mom, you believe me, don't you?"
Bart,"Mom, that's a school for the blind."
Bart,"I'm Bart Simpson, ay carumba, do the Bartman, etcetera, etcetera."
Bart,"Thanks for the history lesson, sis."
Bart,"I'll show you, I'll move thirty-three inches away."
Bart,Now you tell me.
Bart,"Well, I guess they'd help me hold the dictionaries up."
Bart,Stupid Catholic school. Suffering for my hip attitude... I'm the real Jesus here!
Bart,"What's it to you, Irish?"
Bart,"Well, I'm only here because I got blamed for a prank I didn't do."
Bart,You do?
Bart,Stealing pairs of what? Hubcaps? Reeboks? Human eyes?
Bart,Cool.
Bart,St. Sebastian was a pious Roman soldier...
Bart,"For preaching Christianity to the Romans, the Emperor Diocletian sentenced him to death by hail of arrows."
Bart,"Whoa, this stuff is great! It's way better than the comics I get at the dentist."
Bart,"...Then Father Sean quoted Eminem in his sermon. And in art class, we painted Saint Joan burning at the stake, and mine was the grossest! Catholics rock!"
Bart,"Mom, that's blasphemy! I'll say a rosary for you."
Bart,"Yes'm. Anima Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto..."
Bart,"Sorry Mom, but this is the Catholic church. Chicks don't have any authority here."
Bart,I thought there was a monster in the potty.
Bart,"Why did you guys have to take me away? You're always nagging me to go to church, and now that I am, it's the wrong one."
Bart,"Okay, I'll pick a religion for me. Judaism."
Bart,DON'T HAVE... A COW MAN / DON'T HAVE... A COW MAN / DON'T HAVE... A COW MAN / HAVE A PIECE OF FISH! Oy!
Bart,"Mom, a religion isn't cool just because they've glommed onto some crappy rock band from the nineteen forties."
Bart,"You just don't get it. I've made a sacred commitment to the Catholic church, and... paintball! Awesome!"
Bart,Die! Die! Die!
Bart,"Easy on the zeal, church-os! I've got something to say."
Bart,"Don't you get it -- it's all Christianity, people! The little stupid differences are nothing next to the big stupid similarities!"
Bart,I want to see Santa. He can explain why he gave me a PlayStation box with nothing inside but a coloring book.
Bart,"Whatcha readin', Santa?"
Bart,You don't seem very jolly.
Bart,In your dreams.
Bart,"When they put Santa in the ambulance, why did they pull the blanket all the way up over his head?"
Bart,"Boy, Homer. I've never seen Mom this mad."
Bart,She should be back now. It's dinner time.
Bart,We're out of waffles.
Bart,"Dad, I promise I'll be good."
Bart,Can I get out of the dog carrier?
Bart,Country cousins? Are they rubes? 'Cause I don't cotton to rubes.
Bart,Can we say it's my birthday and get free stuff?
Bart,"So, how are we related again?"
Bart,Oh yeah...
Bart,Dad! Those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees!
Bart,A stamp museum?
Bart,Again! Again!
Bart,Again!
Bart,Again!
Bart,That's enough.
Bart,"Then the zombies will eat you first, and you won't have to watch 'em eat us."
Bart,"Well, thanks for making me feel better, knowing that your screams when the zombies chomp your brains will warn me so I can get away."
Bart,"Oh, glad to hear you say that -- because the person who doesn't believe in zombies is always the first to get feasted upon."
Bart,"Yeah, and I could really use your help."
Bart,"Pay the man, Homer."
Bart,You read a book all the way through? Why?
Bart,"All right, commercials!"
Bart,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Bart,Ow.
Bart,"Yeah, if Dad ever rolls over, you're dead."
Bart,"Well, if you're lookin' for Lisa, she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back."
Bart,I figured the best thing I could do is monitor the news for any reports.
Bart,"Hey Mom, can we have fried chicken for dinner?"
Bart,This is awesome! Black God rules!
Bart,"Mmm. Don't worry, Dad. I'm saving one for you."
Bart,I'll just leave it here in the dog's mouth.
Bart,What do you think?
Bart,You think that's traumatic.
Bart,"So Milhouse walks into the bedroom, and there's his Mom and Dad going..."
Bart,"Oh, Mr. Van Houten, I love when you kiss me! Yeah, yeah, kissing ladies is the best. Oh baby, kiss my mouth. Kiss me like we're in a fancy hotel."
Bart,"And I always got the spillover. Drive-in movies, two Christmases, soda with dinner -- we lived like kings!"
Bart,That was some New Years. Now listen. I think we should consider breaking your parents up again.
Bart,"Look, you know they're gonna separate again. So why don't we just speed up the process?"
Bart,That's why he had to go away forever.
Bart,I'm afraid he has to spend another year searching for his brain.
Bart,"You'd better hope not, 'cause you know what comes next? Your worst nightmare: a baby sister."
Bart,"Skanks for nothing, Lamerella."
Bart,That's a brilliant idea. Those TV writers are geniuses!
Bart,This bra is really gonna lift and separate: lift your mother's suspicions and separate your parents!
Bart,We tried to break up your parents and we broke up mine!
Bart,"Lisa, we don't need to know how. It's just a natural thing that happens, like a hurricane or going to war."
Bart,"Yeah, I can see how you'd think that. But on the other hand..."
Bart,"Ha, ha, you read books."
Bart,"Oh come on, wouldn't it be easier if our parents divorced and you compensated by marrying much older men? Meanwhile, I'll be one of those weird guys who's thirty-five and shows up at high school basketball games."
Bart,"Uh, Mom?"
Bart,Uh... you know that bra that broke up our family?
Bart,"Well, I looked into it, and it turns out I was responsible."
Bart,What?! How do you know about things like that?
Bart,"But now Dad can come home, right?"
Bart,But he's innocent.
Bart,Does this mean you and Dad might get a D-A-V-U-R-S?
Bart,Nooo!!!!!
Bart,"Milhouse, our reverse parent trap just made everything worse."
Bart,THE OTHER LIKES TO CHASE A COW
Bart,How many times do I have to tell you: no Rodgers and Hammerstein!
Bart,No!
Bart,"Rocks... shatter... jagged cliff... Lis, you've just given me an idea for the most insane, hair-brained, fool-proof scheme ever!"
Bart,"Okay. When Mom and Dad see this dummy fall in the river, they'll think it's me, and they'll realize what really matters: each other."
Bart,"Now, to make sure Homer and Marge are in proper viewing position..."
Bart,"Now, I'll get my Mom and Dad's attention, and you shove the dummy in the water. Any questions?"
Bart,Pile of dog doo. Let's roll.
Bart,"Mom, Dad! I'm playing on a dangerous cliff -- because you're too busy arguing to pay attention to me!"
Bart,Now!
Bart,This is all my fault! I planted Mom's bra in Milhouse's parents' bed!
Bart,Mom... Dad. I'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together.
Bart,"Hey Lis, I bet I could jump in the swimming pool from here."
Bart,"No, the stupidest thing would be doing it backwards."
Bart,Cowa--
Bart,Time to destroy the one who did this to me.
Bart,Did you replace me with this tinkertoy?
Bart,Eat my shorts.
Bart,Thank God I landed in a bunch of fruity birds.
Bart,This is where stem cell research led us!
Bart,What are you talking about?
Bart,"We're still going to the toy store, right? And I can pick out as many toys as I want?"
Bart,There should be a law against abandoning your child...
Bart,"I'm not a robot, I'm human."
Bart,"I said I'm a human, not a girl."
Bart,Can I stay with you guys tonight?
Bart,"Yeah, maybe. What did you used to do?"
Bart,"I get it, I get it! Sucks to be you. Goodnight."
Bart,I'm ho-me!
Bart,"No fair! Dad gets to kill wild animals, but I shoot one bird and I have to go to a psychiatrist."
Bart,That's not even a mask. It's axle grease!
Bart,But what will junkies do drugs under?
Bart,"Mom, can we buy a magnesium-vapor soak tub?"
Bart,But how will I increase my vitality?
Bart,"Mom, please. I'm playing a video game."
Bart,"Ooh -- small hill. Pedal, pedal, pedal!"
Bart,"Now, enjoy scenery. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!"
Bart,Moms don't get lonely.
Bart,Hey Mom! Wanna go for a ride?
Bart,"Mom, I mean it. I wanna ride with you."
Bart,I HEARD OL' NEIL PUT HER DOWN.
Bart,"THIS SOUTHERN MAN DON'T NEED HIM 'ROUND, ANYHOW! Mom, who's Neil Young?"
Bart,I'unno. Think they have videogames?
Bart,Batting cage?
Bart,Rock climbing wall?
Bart,Robot musical revue?
Bart,Zumanity by Cirque de Soleil?
Bart,Bathroom?
Bart,"Well, that's really what I need the most. Let's go."
Bart,"Wow, Mom, I love tea!"
Bart,"Yeah, well I still love this place."
Bart,"Oh, you."
Bart,"Mom, all we have is carrot sticks and fresh fruit."
Bart,All right! Pedal to the kettle!
Bart,"Sorry, Milhouse, I've got plans."
Bart,"Me too, Mother."
Bart,What'd it say?
Bart,"Hey, we could have tea in my treehouse."
Bart,"Yeah. You know, that puddle started life as a bowl of cereal."
Bart,"Mom, this is great! It makes our real house look like a pile of crap."
Bart,Mom!
Bart,I can't wait to use our new Krusty the Clown tea service!
Bart,What? Um... uh... I just shoplifted this bad boy. Housewares never knew what hit 'em.
Bart,Uh... because I'm gonna bring it back to the store for store credit.
Bart,"Um, well..."
Bart,"Hey, there is no way that Bart Simpson is a mama's boy."
Bart,Shut up! I don't want your stupid sweatshirt! Or your tea set!
Bart,"Mom, I only hung out with you because I felt sorry for you!"
Bart,I can't believe she suckered me into being a mama's boy. I've got to make this place mine again.
Bart,It's gonna take me weeks to get the booger wall back up.
Bart,You're not allowed in here! Can't you read the sign?
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Hey, Mom."
Bart,But we had so much fun on that bike!
Bart,"Mom, I really did like hanging out with you."
Bart,You know... there's a karaoke night at school tomorrow. Some of the little kids are bringing their parents. Do you wanna go?
Bart,Sure... why not? It'll be fun.
Bart,"You know, Mother, I wasn't sure about tonight. But seeing us dressed the same really feels right!"
Bart,Are you kidding? I love my tinklies.
Bart,"Mother, what are you doing?"
Bart,"Mom, I thought this is what you wanted."
Bart,"Hey losers, I'm gonna do to you what you did to these songs."
Bart,Die! Die! Die!
Bart,"Hey Mom, can I have some money to buy Dad a present?"
Bart,Where do you get your money?
Bart,Cool...
Bart,"That's what I'm gettin', how 'bout you?"
Bart,Ay carumba.
Bart,"Here you go, Dad. I hope you like it. I've forgotten what it is."
Bart,"Cool, I'm a street!"
Bart,"Well, that sign would look good hidden under my bed."
Bart,Check it out... I stole the sign.
Bart,Heeere's Bart!
Bart,"Ralph, there's a hole in your basket."
Bart,We're on food stamps?
Bart,"Wow Mom, great red dress!"
Bart,"This is worse than ""Wheelchair-nocchio."""
Bart,"Hey Cryptkeeper, I like your Dodge Scare-a-van."
Bart,What's with the Canadian flag on your backpack?
Bart,I think Dad may blow your cover.
Bart,Why don't you encourage him to get us some health insurance?
Bart,"Dad, cheese truck!"
Bart,"Sideshow Bob! Of all the Regioni and all the villaggi in all of Italia, you had to be il Mayore of this one."
Bart,"Bob, your family will find out the truth. Sooner or later you'll try to kill me again. Watch, I'll prove it."
Bart,"C'mon, slice, dice, and serve on rice."
Bart,"Yeah, this is Italy -- look, the town drunk is two years old."
Bart,At least this time it was Lisa who ruined Bob's life.
Bart,"Krusty, you gotta help us."
Bart,"Please help us, Krusty. We don't want to be the first Christians to die at the Colosseum."
Bart,Krusty! You saved us!
Bart,Grampa?!
Bart,What do you have against Santa?
Bart,It just slipped out!
Bart,I'VE GOTTA GET DAD A LOUSY TIE!
Bart,LET'S HIT THE FLOOR!
Bart,My Gramma? I haven't seen her in years. She ran away.
Bart,"Hey Grampa, we got a letter for Gramma."
Bart,"Yeah, but that also works for the dog's butt."
Bart,"Mr. Fairbanks, lookin' at your boat I gotta say, Gramma bet on the wrong horse."
Bart,You've said that three times already!
Bart,"Dad, you've been in a coma for three days."
Bart,"What can I say? I missed you, Myra."
Bart,How's things with you and Frank?
Bart,"Ouch. You hang in there, beautiful."
Bart,"So, where's the Skin-man?"
Bart,Ay carumba.
Bart,"Thank you, Satan!"
Bart,"Just think, Milhouse. From now on we'll always be ""those kids who got into the Steam Tunnels."""
Bart,Now I gotta warn you. We could get in trouble.
Bart,"Oh, my God! My Dad had a long talk with me about this, but you can't believe it till you see it!"
Bart,Look -- we're havin' pizza tomorrow!
Bart,"Hey, we can't leave here without turning one little valve."
Bart,Can I cut a deal? I'll give you Milhouse.
Bart,"Myra, can ya help me out here?"
Bart,"Dad, if you take me to Vegas, I'll teach you how to cheat at blackjack."
Bart,What's your system?
Bart,Nobody tells Bart Simpson what to do.
Bart,"Well Homer, looks like I can't go to discipline camp. Which is too bad, 'cause I think this was the thing that would finally straighten me out."
Bart,"Yeah, that'll be way more fun than Vegas."
Bart,"Dad, neither of us wanna go. Why are you doing this? Where's the old carefree Homer who likes to cut loose?"
Bart,"Fight back, fun Homer! Together we can win!"
Bart,"C'mon, Dad, we got a long way to go. You can't stay mad at me the whole time."
Bart,Well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing I'm good at.
Bart,Did you see that? They were eating melon for breakfast!
Bart,"Well Dad, we may not always get along, but we'll never be that lame."
Bart,"Well, I guess it's tinkle time."
Bart,"Hey Stavros, there's a guy in your bathroom tryin' to dine-and-dash."
Bart,"Hm, if I save you, what are you gonna do to me?"
Bart,"Dad, I think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer."
Bart,"Well, maybe if you enjoyed me more, I wouldn't be so screwed up."
Bart,I've learned so much in my three hours here. I don't have to play pranks to feel good. I can just listen to the gentle rhythms of nature.
Bart,Dad?
Bart,I'm gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet!
Bart,I caught it! I'm safe!
Bart,I guess.
Bart,But it's the teacher who's bullying me.
Bart,"Oh, how much longer can this go on?"
Bart,Bombardment. Bombardment. How do you like bombardment? I'll show him.
Bart,Time for the bombarded to become the bombardier.
Bart,Why'd I put this in here?
Bart,"Oh yeah, that's why."
Bart,Hee-eere.
Bart,Kid power!
Bart,"Listen, I'm real sorry I busted your shack. Let me make it up to you. I know a ravine where there's a rusted-out car."
Bart,"That's my mom, I gotta go. I finished nailing this board."
Bart,"Oh yeah, you're out of nails."
Bart,Maybe you could aim a little higher.
Bart,"Hey, that's great. G'night."
Bart,"You're on, Lis."
Bart,Care to concede that bet?
Bart,And that job's taken. Skinner dumped it on the next-lowest guy on the totem pole.
Bart,"Checkin' out a cave is gonna be awesome! It'll be dark, with rocks, and mineral formations, and plants that have adapted to harsh-- Wait a minute! This is a scam -- we're on a nature walk!"
Bart,Wow! Wow!!! WOW!!!
Bart,"Where'd it go?! Where'd it go?! Oh, it's in the cap."
Bart,"That was two firemen, a crane and Snow White."
Bart,"But on the upside, I found some cave paintings and made them awesome."
Bart,I've got detention all summer.
Bart,Because I'm a screw-up. My sister's the smart one -- all I do is get in trouble.
Bart,"Oh, it doesn't matter. Everyone's pretty much given up on me. I bet I won't even make it through fourth grade."
Bart,"Oh, that load of crap? No, I was just keepin' her busy while Nelson stole microscopes. Make with the story."
Bart,I need an operation?
Bart,And that's why I didn't have time to study for my geography test.
Bart,Why does God always need money?
Bart,Ready?
Bart,And... joust!
Bart,Let's do it again!
Bart,"Dad, Mom's over at the Flanders', babysitting Nimrod and Nimtodd. We wanna do something."
Bart,"Hey, you know where the bathroom is?"
Bart,"Cheer up, Toot-Toot. Have some of my ice cream."
Bart,Help! She's grooming me! She's grooming me!
Bart,"Look, it's been fun and all, but I miss indoor plumbing."
Bart,"Sorry, lady. I've never eaten fresh fruit and I reckon I never will."
Bart,Whoa! This Oreo is rank.
Bart,Whee. Whee.
Bart,Toot-Toot! Look! I'm using this rock as a tool!
Bart,Ow!
Bart,"Okay, but don't let our hands touch. It's gay."
Bart,"Um... it means you used to be afraid, but now you're not."
Bart,Mom didn't say anything about high-def!
Bart,I got my tenure right here.
Bart,"Well, my Mom says why bother punishing me, I never learn."
Bart,"Help me, cameraman! I let you smoke a cigarette in my bedroom."
Bart,Then Itchy used an ice cream scoop to scoop out Scratchy's heart and make it a sundae. The End.
Bart,"I, uh, I don't think you wanna see her just now."
Bart,"And that's not your strong suit, big guy."
Bart,"Hell, yeah!"
Bart,Luxury? This thermostat is just painted on.
Bart,What's a MacGyver and why does it have a convention?
Bart,"Dad, I've gotta write a report on the Great Lakes."
Bart,"Also, I can't sleep at night 'cause there's this new bully who follows me home and..."
Bart,I think he's in the house!
Bart,"So Mr. Burns, you're saying my Dad has gone insane and thinks he's a god and broken off all contact with the outside world?"
Bart,You don't have to worship him. He's not a God.
Bart,When is our food gonna get here? I'm starved.
Bart,I've got my toy wood lump!
Bart,What jolly fun!
Bart,"Well, I'm sure the way to win her heart is to be fat and crying."
Bart,"When we landed, I was gonna denounce my sister as a witch."
Bart,Thirty-one plus forty-three.
Bart,Hey!
Bart,"Well, one time I read this boring comic book about a ship called ""The Bounty..."""
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,He's out there playin' basketball!
Bart,What's our back story? What's our back story?
Bart,Cool! No gravity!
Bart,"Oh, there it is."
Bart,You?
Bart,"Dad, taking the family to opening night is the nicest thing you've ever done for us."
Bart,"Don't worry, Mom. They all passed by."
Bart,Woo hoo! I'm drenched in blood!
Bart,This rocks! No more stupid girl classes -- like ballroom dancing!
Bart,"It is gonna be awesome! Now I can walk down the hall with ""Bart Junior"" hangin' out. Isn't that right, Bart Junior?"
Bart,Punch for a punch.
Bart,"So what's your name, newbie?"
Bart,You have toilet paper on your shoe.
Bart,"I'm gonna call you ""Toilet."""
Bart,Toilet.
Bart,"Hey Lis, you missed it. While you were at girls' school, Nelson totally whaled on this dork."
Bart,Oh my God...
Bart,"So, did you tell Mom you got beat up?"
Bart,"Hey, no one with a choice should ever have to be a girl. I'll teach you how to be a boy."
Bart,You're a boy -- nothing is sweet.
Bart,Sweet.
Bart,"Now, when you eat like a boy, only two French fries in five should make it into your mouth."
Bart,"""If they fall on the floor, you want 'em more."" Because then they come with extra toppings."
Bart,Awesome! Do it in that guy's bag while he's not looking.
Bart,"Now, for your final test. To fully become a man, you must pick a fight with someone weaker than you."
Bart,I guess I'm gonna have to get this party started.
Bart,Fight! Fight! Fight!
Bart,Wait a minute -- do you know why you did good at math?
Bart,"The only reason Lisa won is because she learned to think like a boy! I turned her into a burping, farting, bullying, math machine!"
Bart,"Duh! Nobody wants their address painted on the curb. We do it without asking, and then they have to pay."
Bart,That's honest work for honest pay!
Bart,"Well, then we're gonna leave you one digit short."
Bart,"Dad, isn't it wrong to open or eat other people's mail?"
Bart,"Oh Dad, no one can rationalize like you."
Bart,"Hi, I'm Bart. I'm ten years old and a professional moto-cross jumper. Can you buy me a moto-cross bike?"
Bart,Oh it's great. Like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.
Bart,It hurts when I swallow.
Bart,I can't believe you remembered me through Milhouse. He's not even my best friend.
Bart,We've got to tell Dad!
Bart,"My grades will suffer! In fact, they're already suffering."
Bart,Look at this garden of F's. You planted them all!
Bart,"School? Oh my God, I've wasted the whole summer. There's so many things I still wanna do."
Bart,I've got to squeeze a whole summer of carefree fun into one day.
Bart,Win Baseball Game.
Bart,"Sure, why not?"
Bart,Appear in Summer Stock Play...
Bart,"Sit on it, Springfield! Yeah!"
Bart,Summer blockbuster...
Bart,Oh... so that's why everyone's been sayin' that all summer.
Bart,"No, not yet! I have to have a summer romance!"
Bart,I'll never forget you.
Bart,Gotta go.
Bart,I just had my first kiss.
Bart,Weaving?!
Bart,"Homer, you're my father, you're supposed to protect me from things like this!"
Bart,Not if I spend the whole time running around like this.
Bart,"Die, weapons, die!"
Bart,"C'mon, Milhouse. Do you wanna play in the NBA or not?"
Bart,That means it's working.
Bart,"So, according to creationism, there were no cavemen."
Bart,So do I!
Bart,Milhouse will serve the time for you while you flee to Mexico. Your new name: Señorita Ugly.
Bart,"You can take off the wig, Milhouse."
Bart,Remember when we saw Hunch's butt in the shower?
Bart,"Nah, I know enough."
Bart,"S'okay, Buck! Bad hop, bad hop!"
Bart,You suck!
Bart,"C'mon, Doc -- she's a fine-lookin' woman! You don't wanna work that?"
Bart,Wow. I've got this sudden urge to give her a five dollar bill.
Bart,"Dad, because you and Mom screwed up Buck Mitchell's marriage, some kids beat me up at school today."
Bart,"Oh, Papa."
Bart,Cancel all my appointments.
Bart,"Don't worry, dude. We'll hook you up with some tunes."
Bart,"Look at me, I'm Otto! I'm a hundred years old and I drive a school bus!"
Bart,"Bye-bye, take care, watch your step, eat my shorts, have a good one..."
Bart,"She's all yours, dude. Oh, and I think I ran over a moose."
Bart,Let me drive. I go through yellow lights.
Bart,"Sorry, sorry, sorry!"
Bart,That was Fat Tony!
Bart,Cool! Who is it?
Bart,You said you meant to make brownies. Any other lies?
Bart,"Krusty, Fat Tony hasn't received his weekly payment for keeping McDonald's and Burger King out of town."
Bart,It fell off a truck-truck truck.
Bart,I don't know.
Bart,"Dad, you want I should plug him in the ankle?"
Bart,"Thanks, but I'm going into bootleg DVDs."
Bart,"So, how did Malt Liquor Mommy die?"
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Yes. Of course.
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Sorry, White Stripes. No hard feelings?"
Bart,I thought you wanted me to drum!
Bart,Absolutely not.
Bart,Okay... if you give me your omelet.
Bart,Woo hoo! I'm a professional musician!
Bart,I was jamming with Skinny Turner and Marbles Le Marquez! And they want me to join their trio!
Bart,"Lisa, you've got to be more careful! I need you to teach me all about the world of juzz."
Bart,"Man, I am so juzzed."
Bart,"It's mergatronic, Daddy-Ho."
Bart,Xavier Cugat!
Bart,Not smoking reefer!
Bart,My arm! It hurts where the tiger's biting it!
Bart,Says you!
Bart,"I was a great drummer, and now I'm nothing! Just like Phil Collins."
Bart,"Hey guys, great news -- I can drum again!"
Bart,"Well, I've got a confession to make. This right arm... it's not mine."
Bart,The doctor did say surgery might help... but it costs seventy-eight thousand dollars!
Bart,The benefit concert!
Bart,This benefit concert is gonna be Scooby Dooby.
Bart,Why are you sad? Thinking about your marriage?
Bart,"I feel weird. It's like a potato chip full of shame, going down my throat sideways."
Bart,Now I'm gonna learn a new word.
Bart,How can I end this torture?!
Bart,You're my mother! How can you say that?
Bart,Good morn-ing.
Bart,Ow!
Bart,"I wanna thank everyone for this special night. Jazz folk may have the smallest apartments, but they also have the biggest hearts."
Bart,But the biggest heart I know is in my sister Lisa.
Bart,"Lis, you poured your heart into rescuing society's most vulnerable critters: animals. So I want all the money we've raised tonight to go to building... The Lisa Simpson Home for Abandoned Animals!"
Bart,"Yeah, hasn't been the same since they murdered the Mayor's Dad here."
Bart,"These games are so old. Who got these high scores? Pilgrims? Hmm, never saw this one before."
Bart,What's going on here? Am I destroying these triangles or trying to assemble them? What does this button do? Now my ship is pooping more triangles!
Bart,"Oh no, I won a free game!"
Bart,Ew.
Bart,"A fire?! I didn't start a fire in the teachers' lounge! I mean, what fire? I mean, a letter from school? Please elaborate."
Bart,It's like you're the Jesus of carpentry.
Bart,"Why should we have to give up our salty snacks, just to keep one allergic kid from exploding?! Who is this selfish jerk anyway?"
Bart,"Willie, you can tell me: who's the mystery wuss who can't eat peanuts?"
Bart,"""His,"" eh? Hmm, so it's a dude."
Bart,Hmmm.
Bart,"Yes, you might say he'll ""blow up."""
Bart,"I'm not a big fan of detention. You might say, it drives me nuts."
Bart,I brought you breakfast in bed.
Bart,Eat it.
Bart,"Good morning, Seymour. You may be wondering what I'm doing with this hat full of maggots..."
Bart,No! I'm allergic!
Bart,No one teaches me history!
Bart,Shrimp?!
Bart,Kids don't die!
Bart,I was... El Barto.
Bart,Mind your own beeswax!
Bart,Dad?
Bart,Grampa?
Bart,"Dad, you're eating Dr. Phil!"
Bart,"No, I'm gonna go backstage and complain. This Krusty Brand alarm clock sprays acid in your face."
Bart,"Whoa, Krusty's prop room!"
Bart,Cool! It's that clown car all those midgets drowned in!
Bart,"Krusty, what's that monster?"
Bart,Come to my house at midnight.
Bart,It worked!
Bart,"Now, there's something I've wanted to do for a long time."
Bart,"Can't you read my writing? I didn't say kick Homer's ""walls""."
Bart,That's better.
Bart,"I don't think so. In fact, why don't you give me your lunch money?"
Bart,"No, my go-- Yes, him."
Bart,"Finally, someone who does whatever I say."
Bart,Get lost.
Bart,"Oh, it's always the Jews' fault."
Bart,He was driving me crazy so I sent him on an errand.
Bart,Will you shut up?
Bart,We're outsmarting the Martians.
Bart,"Uh, Paw."
Bart,"Milhouse, that is the most pathetic thing I ever... oh my God, she's beautiful!"
Bart,Wait -- they're employees! They have to be nice to us! Let's go.
Bart,Oh shoe-boy? I'm looking for something in a cross-trainer.
Bart,What size do I smell like?
Bart,Re-lace them all!
Bart,Who are these wonderful people?
Bart,"Great news, Ma! I agreed to join the army when I turn eighteen!"
Bart,How come I can't join the army but Lisa gets to be in PETA?
Bart,"Whoa, even the Army has Humvees now!"
Bart,"Don't worry, Dad. You'll do great."
Bart,Lisa's face?
Bart,"Well, it's not fair when Moleman uses his replacement legs."
Bart,"Yay, Grampa!"
Bart,"Hey guys, didja hear? ""The Da Vinci Code"" just sold one hundred million copies!"
Bart,"Hey Lis, we learned so much scootin' around Vermont. Did you know that candles are made by losers?"
Bart,He ruined her first Wordloaf!
Bart,A-yup.
Bart,I only eat the clown heads.
Bart,I've always done it. Just like I only eat the eyes off a lobster.
Bart,"Otto, you totally pimped Dad's ride!"
Bart,She's been gone for a while.
Bart,There's Mom!
Bart,"It's not coffee, it's hot Pepsi!"
Bart,"Man, Mom and Dad are really going at it."
Bart,"Milhouse, steady my duds!"
Bart,Wait. What if... NOBODY goes? He can't kill all of us.
Bart,"Well said! If we all stand together, Nelson's helpless. Hell no, we won't show! Hell no, we won't show!"
Bart,"Yup, he'll be all alone on his birthday! Oh, I wish I could see it. Boo hoo! I'm Nelson. No one likes me."
Bart,What are you gonna do about it?
Bart,Hey!
Bart,"Mom, I can't go -- no one else is!"
Bart,Kind of?
Bart,"Dad, don't make me go! I'll give you a back rub!"
Bart,Why?
Bart,"Okay, just walk in, say happy birthday, and get out."
Bart,"This party doesn't suck. Pizza, that's a nice touch."
Bart,"Um, happy birthday, Nelson."
Bart,Oh yeah. It's a parking lot out there.
Bart,Nelson... nobody's coming.
Bart,"Well, that's the thing. Sometimes, you can be kind of a jerk."
Bart,Maybe you can have fun with just me.
Bart,Wait... I have an idea.
Bart,"Not bad. We had pizza, cake, and then sang songs with Nelson's Gramma. But, it was a one-time thing, and now I'll never see him again."
Bart,"Yeah, yeah, it was uh, super fun. Good times. Hey, Ralph! Have I got a half a sandwich for you."
Bart,"Um, Nelson, I was just thinking about us being ""best friends."""
Bart,"Look, um, I don't have time for new friends. I got a lot on my plate. I've got a big report due on the Nile river: topic sentence, bibliography, page numbers... it's nuts."
Bart,"That's right, we're best friends now. So why don't you go pick on someone smaller and weaker?"
Bart,"Nelson, do you ever wish you weren't a bully?"
Bart,Man... I never knew you were so deep.
Bart,A Nelson vest!
Bart,"From then on, my life changed."
Bart,"All of a sudden, I was a somebody in a school full of nobodies. I could go anywhere, do anything. For us, to live any other way was nuts."
Bart,Life was perfect.
Bart,Milhouse.
Bart,"Hey, don't use the ""b"" word around me. It's offensive."
Bart,"They just can, okay."
Bart,"Whoa, Bart Simpson is nobody's sidekick."
Bart,'Cause my chest is cold and my arms aren't.
Bart,"All right, I will."
Bart,"Sorry, I was uh... stealing loose grapes at the grocery store."
Bart,We were just having fun. Don't get upset.
Bart,No thanks.
Bart,"Me and Nelson were best friends, and now I think he's gonna kill me!"
Bart,"Um, okay."
Bart,No! I can't do it! You're a nut bar! A whack-job! A kooka-dooka!
Bart,"Please, just leave me alone!"
Bart,I've set up a trust. It bypasses the inheritance tax.
Bart,"We sure are far from the rest of 'em. Funny how that happened, huh?"
Bart,"Nelson, please don't kill me! Remember when we made fun of Cinco de Mayo? I called it ""Stinko de Mayo"". We laughed so hard..."
Bart,Say again?
Bart,There you go again -- you act all nice and then you go crazy.
Bart,"Um, Nelson? Was the water always up to our necks? Nelson?!"
Bart,Help! Help!
Bart,Where'd you get it?
Bart,Aaagh! Man lips!
Bart,Where is Nelson?
Bart,What?
Bart,"Hey, thanks for saving me, man."
Bart,You mean...
Bart,"Nelson, I'll never forget that week we were best friends."
Bart,"Please, Santa?"
Bart,"I didn't think it would ever come, but it did!"
Bart,Do you really understand what that means?
Bart,All he left me with are these used nicotine patches.
Bart,Gil's gone.
Bart,Problem solved.
Bart,Can we have pancakes for dinner?
Bart,"Whoa, Gil's a big shot!"
Bart,There's a spot!
Bart,What about Brazil?
Bart,Better than cod?
Bart,"Oh, baby!"
Bart,Dad... I couldn't stay with Mom and Lisa while you were out here.
Bart,"They were gonna go to the Folk Art Museum, then they were gonna paint crab shells. Not crush them, paint them."
Bart,"We're still gonna make it, aren't we Dad?"
Bart,In about two seconds.
Bart,"Nicely done, Lis. Instead of killing living things, they're just killing trees."
Bart,Neon Breeze!
Bart,"Papa, may we have chocolat?"
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,That's the only line I get in your stupid story?!
Bart,I'm really sorry.
Bart,"Dad, wait! You haven't heard my story."
Bart,"My story takes place in a time I call ""the past""."
Bart,That stunk worse than boiled cabbage.
Bart,"I want to avenge you, but I don't know how."
Bart,Holy Hannah! I've got more muscles than a New England clambake. Now all I need is a superhero name.
Bart,I'll keep thinking.
Bart,I'm Bart-Man.
Bart,"So you see, revenge is great. And there's three ways to talk about it. Although two of the ways were kind of the same way, and even the third one might have worked better as a Halloween story..."
Bart,"Hey Lis, check it out! With some clever scissor work, I can make the ""LakeLand Butter"" Indian maiden show me her boobs."
Bart,"Clean, dirty clean, dirty clean, dirty ..."
Bart,"Cool -- look what Snap's doing to Pop, while Crackle watches!"
Bart,"If this works, I'll go faster than any ten-year-old has ever gone."
Bart,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Bart,"My last words are ""Lisa suuuucks""!"
Bart,Really? Hmmm.
Bart,That's it! I want a license!
Bart,"No, to drive."
Bart,No way -- I don't want my guts touching some sick guy!
Bart,"Hey, guys. I'll see you in a bit. I entered a thousand mile Baja Road race."
Bart,Hello?
Bart,"Y'know, it'd be a real shame if someone started investigating your ""Indian heritage."""
Bart,"Oh, man! What now?"
Bart,"This sucks! I can't do anything fun, 'cause I'm doing so many stupid errands!"
Bart,"Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
Bart,I gotta get outta this town for a while. Time to put the pedal to the metal.
Bart,"Hm, North Haverbrook. The very name conjures up romance and intrigue."
Bart,"Wow, a mint condition ""Hippie Hulk"" from 1968!"
Bart,"Man, this town's got everything!"
Bart,Any of you ladies like stereo music?
Bart,"Uh... yeah, I have that disease that makes you look like an old man, but they gave me medicine for it and I took too much."
Bart,"I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you? Oh, right. Darcy."
Bart,That is such a girl thing to say.
Bart,What?!
Bart,"No, I'm not, but--"
Bart,"Look, Darcy, I like you. I really do. It's just... I'm only ten years old."
Bart,I'm gonna be a father?!
Bart,Really? We didn't? But we kissed and held hands at the same time.
Bart,"I'm ten and stupid! Look, if I'm not the father, then who is?"
Bart,How religious can you be if you're pregnant?
Bart,Good answer.
Bart,"Look, Darcy, maybe there's still a way we can get married."
Bart,Utah? Home of America's most powerful weirdoes?
Bart,Awesome!
Bart,Um-hm. I bet they sell them in Utah.
Bart,We're in the middle of the desert...
Bart,"Take my wife... please! Hey, I finally get that joke!"
Bart,Ow!
Bart,Just one.
Bart,Maybe I found someone else to do it for me. Someone who will do a more thorough job.
Bart,Utah karate!
Bart,"Darcy, in fifty years, you might see me walking down the street and you'll wonder, ""Is that Bart?"" And I'll go and you'll know."
Bart,/
Bart,"You know, I thought Darcy and I would be like a real married couple. Instead we just ended up fighting all the time."
Bart,"You know, for a while, I was kinda looking forward to bein' a dad."
Bart,Aww. And someday you'll be one too.
Bart,You got it.
Bart,TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR / HOW I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE /
Bart,UP ABOVE THE WORLD SO HIGH / LIKE A DIAMOND IN THE SKY...
Bart,Wheee! /
Bart,Mine has a cup holder!
Bart,You're a blowhole!
Bart,"No, boy! Up, up, up!"
Bart,INT. LAKESIDE MANSION - KITCHEN - PRESENT - LATER
Bart,I've got Grampa's medication!
Bart,"No lunch for me...unless I ""scare"" one up."
Bart,"Hey guys, remember to stick together. Today is the anniversary of the Dark Stanley murders."
Bart,All right...
Bart,Imagine I'm holding a flashlight under my face.
Bart,"Years ago, Stanley DeGroot was a cook here at the school..."
Bart,All the kids made fun of him because he never graduated from college.
Bart,"One day, Stanley picked up a cleaver and put a new entrée on the menu."
Bart,A delectable little dish called kids'-head soup.
Bart,They hanged him for murder and buried him in an unmarked grave. When they came back the next day... the whole cemetery was missing.
Bart,Try not to think about it.
Bart,This is the very spot where Dark Stanley comes to harvest heads for his soup of sorrow.
Bart,"Oh, Dark Stanley would never dare attack a crowded, well-lit--"
Bart,"Seymour, Gary."
Bart,"Why do I have to go to a stupid psychiatrist? I told a scary story, big deal."
Bart,"Stop right there, Doc. This school has sent me to more therapists than you've had bad dates. I've looked at the ink blots, I've played with the puppets, the whole racket's a hat fulla crap."
Bart,"Yeah, right -- I bet you've got a bunch of ""learning"" games. Why don't you go online and look for a boyfriend while I take a nap?"
Bart,"Whoa! You've got ""D.K.C.2.D.K.S.""? That one's rated ""Bad For Everyone""!"
Bart,Yes!
Bart,Booger.
Bart,Read it back! Read it back!
Bart,You can't make that stuff up!
Bart,That this is one terrible county fair.
Bart,And... My Dad never takes me on the merry-go-booger. He's always passed out in the parking snot.
Bart,"And then I had this dream that my whole family was just cartoon characters, and that our success had led to some crazy propaganda network called ""Fox News""."
Bart,See ya next Wednesday.
Bart,Huh? But we were doing such good work.
Bart,I think I just got dumped.
Bart,"Do you think I'm telling people not to have a cow because, deep down, I want them to have a cow?"
Bart,"I saw you yesterday in the dining room, and I didn't know if I should say ""hi"" or not."
Bart,I'm pretty sure I will.
Bart,"...And I wasn't planned, so when I came, my parents had to get married. And they were too young and not ready for a kid to screw up their lives. Maybe... I act out because... if my parents are mad at me, they can't fight with each other!"
Bart,"Yeah, that and ""Stanley"" was the brand of hammer my dad used to hit me with."
Bart,You know what -- I think I'm good.
Bart,Anything could happen. One of these days I might have a complete psychotic breakdown.
Bart,Whoa -- feel the pile on this shag!
Bart,"Oh, baby!"
Bart,"Pinball, eh? I've always wanted to try this."
Bart,"Wow, the graphics are amazing. That ball almost seems real!"
Bart,Ping!
Bart,Ping!
Bart,Ping!
Bart,"No way, this is our rec room!"
Bart,Some kind of bible garbage?
Bart,Could a kid like me get these boxes? Then use 'em for whatever he wanted?
Bart,"Hello, redemption."
Bart,"Oh, I won't."
Bart,Uh... the name of the company is...
Bart,"Dog, Incorporated."
Bart,Now we just have to figure out what to do with these boxes.
Bart,Build a fart! I love it.
Bart,That might work too.
Bart,Lower the drawbridge!
Bart,I love my sister.
Bart,Not till we're bored with them! Now begone!
Bart,Who knew guys in brown shirts could cause so much trouble.
Bart,Want to melt it with a hose?
Bart,"No, Dad, they're the opposite."
Bart,"I'm putting in my ""Catch A Rising Krusty"" doll!"
Bart,References.
Bart,What's that coming out of the safe?
Bart,"Lisa, you fool! You've doomed us all!"
Bart,Noooo!
Bart,Oh my God!
Bart,Check out what's happening behind your restaged anniversary dinner!
Bart,He's supposed to be in a stable long-term gay relationship!
Bart,"There's the Rich Texan -- and his daughter, Paris Texan."
Bart,"Hey Paris, I saw a disgusting part of your body on the internet... your face!"
Bart,Dad! It's Drederick Tatum. Try to get him to punch you.
Bart,"Lis, you can't stay here if you're gonna keep talking."
Bart,Mom?
Bart,We just got up.
Bart,"Actually, it's Saturday."
Bart,Shhh.
Bart,Another senseless killing by... the Shadow Knight!
Bart,"Mom, what are you doing in my game?! How would you like it if I suddenly started going shopping with you?"
Bart,Mommm!
Bart,You're making me look bad in front of my minions!
Bart,I am going off to explore the Crevices of Lagrimmar.
Bart,Jumpin' Johnnycakes! Those dames are cheesed.
Bart,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me just put this holy grail in my trophy room."
Bart,Where's all my stuff?!
Bart,Noooo!
Bart,Mom? Mom?
Bart,It was just a game. A game I used to enjoy before you mommed all over it.
Bart,It's five in the afternoon!
Bart,"Yeah, in Idaho."
Bart,Big if!
Bart,Wanna go slam a few beers?
Bart,You know it.
Bart,"Gee Moe, you give great advice."
Bart,Whatever. I'm gonna go play outside.
Bart,I hogged it! I hogged it!
Bart,"Behold, my naked butt!"
Bart,Each cheek is a god to you!
Bart,Now for the defining moment of my life...
Bart,"Thanks, Chief."
Bart,"There's nothing you can say. After that game, my life is over."
Bart,My favorite song -- ruined!
Bart,Is it my rabbit Cottontail? The one who went to live upstate?
Bart,"LaBoot, LaBoot. Sounds familiar."
Bart,See? I hate me too! Now we can be friends again!
Bart,I hate Bart Simpson!
Bart,"I still can't believe it. They dusted the plate with a non-regulation brush, so we have to play the last inning over again."
Bart,Why do you think that?
Bart,Who warned you?
Bart,I did it! I did it! I did it!
Bart,I can't take it anymore!
Bart,And someone used our videotapes as dominoes!
Bart,"Why don't you just quit taking the pills, you hophead?"
Bart,"Why am I sleeping when right next door is every boy's dream: a fat, suggestible zombie dad."
Bart,Hey zombie -- wanna come out and play?
Bart,"No, play!"
Bart,And that's only one of the cool things we're gonna do with him...
Bart,"C'mon, just one more."
Bart,That's a guy with red hair.
Bart,"Hey, Mom, can we go see Dad put out the fire?"
Bart,What'd you do with all the loot?
Bart,We drove fifty miles to look at a stupid pile of vegetables?
Bart,Yes'm.
Bart,Really?
Bart,"Dad, look, a corn maze!"
Bart,Told you.
Bart,That was never my plan.
Bart,"Don't worry! Our dog'll find my Dad! We need you, boy!"
Bart,We need you!
Bart,Good boy! Now go find Homer!
Bart,"Santa's Little Helper would be an awesome police dog! Can he, Dad? Can he?"
Bart,"Please, can he?"
Bart,"Boy, it is gonna be so cool when you're a police dog..."
Bart,"Good boy! Now, transform!"
Bart,Cool.
Bart,"Okay, since the dog's not here, I'm gonna take you for a walk."
Bart,"I miss Santa's Little Helper. I wanted him to be a police dog, but now he has no time for me. I even have to eat my own homework!"
Bart,"Boy, you're back!"
Bart,Ow! You bit me! My own dog bit me.
Bart,I can't believe it. My own dog bit me.
Bart,"Mom, you can't send him away! He's a dog, not Grampa!"
Bart,"Well, I bet he can't resist this."
Bart,"Fetch, boy!"
Bart,My God. I've lost him.
Bart,"I don't want a new dog. I want my old dog, the one who bit me."
Bart,That's it! I want a snake!
Bart,He is so awesome. I already love him more than I love Lisa.
Bart,"I like it -- ""Strangles."" Hey Lis, wanna touch Strangles? He's not slimy at all. He's scaly."
Bart,That's because I soaked him in slime!
Bart,"Hey, don't ask me to show if you can't handle the tell."
Bart,"Here, Strangles! Strangles?"
Bart,"Aw man, it's like some chemicals cut one."
Bart,"Strangles, you came to save me!"
Bart,"Santa's Little Helper, you came too!"
Bart,Sorry... but a boy's gotta go with his dog.
Bart,"Oh, I knew you loved me boy! Now you can be my dog again."
Bart,"If I help you, I want full immunity for all pranks past and future, and you have to teach me a swear word I don't already know."
Bart,"Okay, suit yourself -- it's not like you have any major events coming up that the bullies would want to disrupt."
Bart,"Wow, that's a swear?"
Bart,Sweet. Now I'm gonna need some wheels.
Bart,"Lisa, they're gonna put a stink bomb in the school! I might be able to stop them, but I'll need a schematic of Jimbo's house."
Bart,"Dammit, these blueprints are all wrong! Where's the roller coaster room? And the shark tank?"
Bart,"Son of a beach ball, they're gone!"
Bart,"I've got a man down! Well, not a man. A very special boy."
Bart,What? Who is this?
Bart,"Me? Uh, I'm... Ahmed Adoody."
Bart,"Hey Nelson, what gives? Martin just skipped past you singing ""Skip to my Lou,"" and you did nothing!"
Bart,Is Martin working for Jimbo?!
Bart,Yes what?
Bart,Lisa... are you on a secure line?
Bart,"But it looks so cool. Listen, there's a mole inside CTU."
Bart,"Yes, a mole. Now I don't have much time, so I'm just gonna come right out and say his name, so get ready to know his name. His name is the following: M--"
Bart,"Hey, I'm fine -- They haven't made a French horn yet that can hurt me. Now, I'm sending you a picture of the bomb."
Bart,HDW. What's that?
Bart,"Lis, you have to release that water. It's the only way to short out the fan."
Bart,The hot dog water's gonna push us into the fan!
Bart,"Keep pitching, I'll be back."
Bart,"Hey, what about me?"
Bart,I almost died... and so did Willie.
Bart,What about me?
Bart,"Let's get this show on the road, man. We got things to do."
Bart,Praise the Lord.
Bart,Dentist?! You said we were going to ride dirt bikes around the cemetery!
Bart,"So you're saying I should do your job, for you, at home, for free. You wish."
Bart,"Good afternoon, Principal Stinkface."
Bart,"Let's see... according to your charts, you're due for your annual throat scraping."
Bart,"Uh-oh, I'm feelin' a lotta cooties down there. We may need to replace a tooth."
Bart,Now rinse...
Bart,"Finally, I'm gonna take an x-ray, so lie perfectly still for twenty minutes."
Bart,I can't wait to get the freshness out of my mouth!
Bart,Dad!
Bart,Uh... I'll Etch-A-Sketch it for you.
Bart,Etch... sketch... etch... sketch...
Bart,It won't come off!
Bart,You mean there are losers who spend all day watching TV looking for stuff to complain about? Who'd be lame enough to do that?
Bart,"Dad, you barely go to work at all."
Bart,"Hey Dad, have fun with your boyfriend."
Bart,Is Uncle Fester still alive?
Bart,Do you wanna get a reaction shot of his ass?
Bart,We knew you could do it!
Bart,"Give 'em hell, Homer."
Bart,"Yay, Dad!"
Bart,Dad?
Bart,"I know it's you, Homer."
Bart,Why aren't you at your new job?
Bart,"But Dad, you've gotta tell her. She's been buying brand-name groceries."
Bart,"No, things rich people buy, like Campbell's Soup and Pepsodent."
Bart,Every place has such a long line.
Bart,There's a place -- with no line!
Bart,It must be a make-your-own sundae bar!
Bart,"Mahogany. Great movie, great casket."
Bart,I miss him too.
Bart,What's your name?
Bart,You're Donny? Pop-pop said that after he died you should give me ten bucks a week. Starting now.
Bart,"Um, listen, I'm outta town next week, so..."
Bart,"Well, time to move on with our lives."
Bart,Is that a real thing?
Bart,"Dad, you were great!"
Bart,"Hey mom, do all conductors carry poisoned blow-darts in their pocket?"
Bart,Is that a real thing?
Bart,"Aw, c'mon, Mom, we'll help you surf."
Bart,"Don't click the cart, or you bought it!"
Bart,You just bought another freezer!
Bart,Faster! More dangerous!
Bart,Awesome! How's he getting around?
Bart,Got one.
Bart,We can say these swears any time we want because they're in the Bible!
Bart,"Shut the Hell up, you damn ass whore."
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Well, I know he seems to get dumber every year, but lately he's plateaued."
Bart,"Well, I have to look good for tomorrow."
Bart,"Well, just this week, there's been field day, picking me up from the airport..."
Bart,What?
Bart,Are you guys fighting over us?
Bart,Oh my God. An alien... in our butane storage shed!
Bart,Wow! Is that your space name?
Bart,Why did you come to our world?
Bart,Whoa. Is that a ray gun?
Bart,"So, this is my Krusty doll, Funzo, Linguo, Iraq War Sergeant Activity with insufficient armor, Phonic Frog, cat skull, Jim Halterman bobble-head doll -- he's a local car dealer..."
Bart,"No! If the government finds out he's here, they'll dissect him!"
Bart,Can I hammer that?
Bart,Can I tighten the--
Bart,I thought we were supposed to do this together.
Bart,I'm helping! I'm helping!
Bart,Look!
Bart,They're coming for-- What's your name?
Bart,What do you weigh? Like a million pounds?
Bart,"We can fly over them with the power of love, right?"
Bart,You killed them.
Bart,I'm just gonna take off now. I'm sure you have a lot of calls to make...
Bart,"Hear me out. It seems to me we gave her a choice: trick or treat. She didn't give us a treat, so..."
Bart,"Trick or Treat isn't just some phrase you chant mindlessly like ""The Lord's Prayer."" It's an oral contract!"
Bart,Why give 'em the choice? That trick was sweeter than any treat we'll get tonight.
Bart,Trick-or-treat! Lick my feet! Your head smells like pig-butt meat!
Bart,Whoa! They turned the church into a haunted house!
Bart,Sin gets us something? Awesome!
Bart,He died as he lived -- like a dork.
Bart,Is it that you're brother and sister? Because you really look a lot alike.
Bart,Half-brother and half-sister?
Bart,Siamese twins who've been surgically separated?
Bart,Cool.
Bart,But why do all your bedtime stories have commercials in them for the container store?
Bart,Check it out -- an animal hole.
Bart,Only one way to find out.
Bart,"Drown, monster, drown!"
Bart,Hey who died?
Bart,So you guys aren't ice cream men?
Bart,"This'll cheer you up. I'll let you kill me in ""Bar Brawl Four: Final Fracas""."
Bart,Uh-oh. I slipped on some blood. I'm totally vulnerable to a full-body jukebox slam.
Bart,"Come on, it's easy. Just push A, B, up, up, left trigger, right trigger, and both triggers at once."
Bart,"Okay, everyone. My best friend is a little messed up, so everyone be extra nice to him."
Bart,"Hey, I'm happy to see Milhouse get some hand-on-hand action. But no one is cooler than Bartholomew J. Simpson."
Bart,Anyone want to sit over here? You can have my pizza crust.
Bart,"Young man, you look like you enjoy fun and excitement."
Bart,"Come on! Look at me, I'm cool. I've got my backpack on frontwards, and I'm krumping!"
Bart,Check it out! This image has not been sped up.
Bart,"Oh my God, look at these poll numbers."
Bart,Aye Carumba! Oh man. Milhouse has gone from being a comic figure to a tragic one.
Bart,"If he could go back to being happy, I could go back to being cool."
Bart,"Let's see... Milhouse would be happy again if he had family to take care of him. Family, family..."
Bart,"Every Christmas... Milhouse gets Danish butter cookies from... Solvang, California... where he has a beloved un... ...cle!"
Bart,Fine. I'll call three numbers. What are they?
Bart,"Okay, so which one of these losers is Milhouse's Uncle Norbert?"
Bart,"Norbert? Norbert? Oh, this guy's a total Norbert."
Bart,You're Uncle Norbert?
Bart,Would you be my uncle?
Bart,"Milhouse, there's someone who wants to see you."
Bart,And that takes care of that.
Bart,"Oh man, now he's even more popular!"
Bart,"Oh, for cryin' out loud."
Bart,"Lis, I don't get it. Why does Milhouse's happiness make me sad?"
Bart,Shut up! I don't love Milhouse.
Bart,"Oh yeah? Well when you're mean, I'm a trampoline, so everything you said goes back and hits your ugly head."
Bart,From Milhouse! I love him so much!
Bart,"Wait, Milhouse! Don't go! You're my best friend."
Bart,Then I'm going with you!
Bart,I can't!
Bart,Still sucks!
Bart,Mr. and Mrs. Van Houten!
Bart,"Lame, lame, lame, lame, have it, lame, Superman Dies, Aquaman Dies, Casper Dies, Caveman Robin, Black Robin, Born-Again Robin..."
Bart,Whoa! The infamous Wolverine comic with pop-out claws!
Bart,You should stop being so mean to us kids.
Bart,None of these things ever really happened.
Bart,"All right, I get it."
Bart,"You're cool, you're not ""mainstream,"" you wear a porkpie hat..."
Bart,...but let's see what you know about super-heroes.
Bart,Who's stronger? The Thung or The Mulk? And show your work.
Bart,You want to know what I think?
Bart,Wow. I was in such a bad relationship with my ex-Comic Book Guy. I'd forgotten how good it could be!
Bart,"Alan Moore, you wrote my favorite issues of Radioactive Man!"
Bart,I don't read the words. I just like when he punches people. How do you make his costume stick so close to his muscles?
Bart,"Face the facts, has-been. This man is the comic book guy our town deserves!"
Bart,You had your hot dog plumped?
Bart,The only person who thinks you're a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath.
Bart,Amen.
Bart,Lemme at it!
Bart,There aren't any tables or chairs.
Bart,"Oh great, here it comes -- all the boring things you've done since the last time you didn't kill us."
Bart,"Yeah, yeah, we've all been to England. Is this going somewhere?"
Bart,Young? I'm the oldest kid in my class! By like two years.
Bart,Stop feeling sorry for him! He's a homicidal maniac! He deserves to fry!
Bart,Bob's playing all of you like saps. This man's a killer!
Bart,"Yoink! Foiled again, freak!"
Bart,"Oh my God, it's beautiful! Are you buying this?"
Bart,I'm not sad. I have nothing to be sad about. Nothing!
Bart,Stupid Sideshow Bob. Even when he's dead he wrecks my life. I hope he's in hell eating a barf burger.
Bart,"Hey, aren't you Bob's brother?"
Bart,"That's stupid. You talk like you're smart, but you're stupid."
Bart,Sounds boring.
Bart,"Well, I guess I could say goodbye."
Bart,I'm going to set things right. Wanna come with me?
Bart,"Cool, I found a trapdoor that leads to an underground city. Here I go!"
Bart,"Bob, it's me, Bart. I came here to tell you I never meant for you to die. I just wanted you to go to jail and get beat up a lot. Now everyone wishes I was dead..."
Bart,Ahhhhh! Sideshow Bob!
Bart,Hot! Hot! Hot!
Bart,Get me outta here. What are you doing? I can't breathe!
Bart,"Nice try, Bob -- but you didn't count on one thing."
Bart,You stink like my butt! Take him away!
Bart,"Because you never feed him, walk him or let him out to pee."
Bart,"No, you idiot. We just pay for it with another bond issue."
Bart,Let her figure out someone to dump it on.
Bart,The Constitution? I'm pretty sure the Patriot Act killed it to ensure our freedoms.
Bart,"I got some old magazines to burn. ""Popular Science,"" ""Redbook"", ""Big and Tall Halloween Costume"" catalogue..."
Bart,Next item...
Bart,"Yeah, you always said that after high school, Dad ""blessed you with the unplanned miracle of me."""
Bart,"Yeah, what happened while I was chillin' in Dad's junk?"
Bart,C'mon. More turbulent than now?
Bart,The nineties? Never heard of it.
Bart,"Mom, why'd you stop talking for two and a half minutes?"
Bart,Did you two ever get back together?
Bart,Mom and Dad are in there. Wanna ruin their fun?
Bart,"Okay... but if Dad kisses Mom too much, a stork will lay an angel egg in her tummy, and the next thing you know we find a baby brother in the cabbage patch! Here's a thumbnail sketch:"
Bart,We wanna hear a story!
Bart,One please.
Bart,"Well I've got a Valentine's Day story! It's about musicians from a simpler time. The era of The Brady Bunch, Donny and Marie, and..."
Bart,Ow! Mom! Lisa hit me!
Bart,Fine. We'll divide the car into your side and my side. My leg is the barrier.
Bart,The system works!
Bart,It's not funny! You're wearing cleats!
Bart,"Sorry I'm late -- I was in a car crash. Many hurt, but nobody cool was harmed."
Bart,Huh?
Bart,Who's the new meat in my seat?
Bart,"Look, new kid, I'm the head hamster in this habitrail. Capeesh?"
Bart,"Oh, I ""capeesh."" I ""capeesh"" just fine."
Bart,Cut it out!
Bart,No.
Bart,Oh fine.
Bart,There's this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me.
Bart,"Really, Dad?"
Bart,You're right. I'm gonna go to school tomorrow and show everyone I'm awesome.
Bart,"Top this, Donny."
Bart,This almost makes me want to find out how magnets work.
Bart,Why did you take the rap for me?
Bart,"Well, remember this: Bart Simpson takes care of his friends."
Bart,Come see me when you get out.
Bart,Let's take a ride. I got a place with a view.
Bart,They're only sold in Europe. I know a guy.
Bart,Check this out.
Bart,Here's a little hair of the dog for tomorrow.
Bart,"Gentlemen, this is an ostrich egg."
Bart,"Now that we're buddies, I can let you in on some of the cool scams we run at school."
Bart,"Bathroom passes, doctor's notes..."
Bart,"Milhouse, bust out four of our finest juice boxes."
Bart,I just wanna say... juice box fight!
Bart,Sure.
Bart,"All right, here's the plan: we go in there, fill the coffee pot with crickets from this bag labeled ""crickets"" and leave."
Bart,"Skinner's five steps ahead of me! I put a tack on his chair, he's corked his pants! I throw a tomato, he's making salad!"
Bart,Because of your stupid accent?
Bart,Who is it?
Bart,"Thanks, Willie!"
Bart,Where am I?
Bart,"Gentlemen, someone I thought I could trust is a rat."
Bart,"Now let's see, is it my best friend? My other best friend? Or a kid I just met?"
Bart,Donny...
Bart,Grab Milhouse's legs. He's the rat!
Bart,You grew tired of always being in my shadow.
Bart,"Don't worry, we'll get him out in a couple hours."
Bart,"Now that we've taken care of our rat problem, Skinner can't stop us. And I've got a prank I've been planning for months. We're gonna egg Skinner's house."
Bart,"Normally, you can't even buy these. You have to buy the ostrich and wait."
Bart,The whole insides.
Bart,"My pleasure, sir."
Bart,We'll see who's laughing when your house is smeared with ostrich albumen.
Bart,Donny's the rat!
Bart,"Ah get back to your knitting, Seymour."
Bart,"So guys, before we hit Skinner's, I want to make a quick stop."
Bart,"There's been a change of plans. I was gonna tell you, but then I remembered... you're the rat!"
Bart,Skinner's tongue was blue!
Bart,"Why'd you do it, man?"
Bart,You were like a brother to me! We were gonna take woodshop together and make nunchucks. And then take people to our lockers and show them our nunchucks!
Bart,A funny thing happens when you mix Mentos with Diet Coke...
Bart,And it's all gonna go down in Skinner's office.
Bart,What are you doing here?
Bart,Willie?! You're on Skinner's side?
Bart,Well... I guess we're even. What are you gonna do now?
Bart,Sweet.
Bart,"Whatcha doin', Mom? Goin' crazy?"
Bart,See that fat lady with the moustache? That's you.
Bart,"Aw, But hers was better!"
Bart,"Oh man, not again."
Bart,"Hey, I didn't know this park was here."
Bart,The internet wrote it -- I just handed it in.
Bart,"Whoa, check that out!"
Bart,"Cool, the strong kicking the weak's butt."
Bart,"Dude, it's Saturday, what kind of a freak wastes his--"
Bart,"Well, I agree you blow."
Bart,"A lot of people blow, but no one blows like you."
Bart,When you look up blow in the dictionary--
Bart,Fine.
Bart,"The bone's the very thing, methinks / to prank my sister and the dink."
Bart,Martin! I've made a major discovery!
Bart,You're one of the major...
Bart,Martin!
Bart,You're right.
Bart,I can bike away much faster -- and ring the bell to drown out bad thoughts!
Bart,You're right. We have to do something. Let's watch TV!
Bart,We're murderers!
Bart,I'm filled with rue!
Bart,"I've been in trouble, but never like this. Guess I'll go turn myself in."
Bart,Lisa! You're saying we shouldn't tell the truth?
Bart,"Usually when I do something bad, I feel good. But not this time. Martin was like Jesus -- only real!"
Bart,"Yeah, nothing's up and nothing's down -- except for Martin, who died."
Bart,Nothing!
Bart,But we're brother and sister.
Bart,But...
Bart,I like pranks. Everyone likes pranks. Even Dr. Hibbert.
Bart,I'm tending to Martin's butterfly enclosure. His butterflies are emerging from their chrysalises tonight.
Bart,You said you wanted to end it all.
Bart,"Dad, look! Raccoons!"
Bart,By which I meant bring Martin's butterfly project to completion.
Bart,Calm down!
Bart,The butterflies are hatching!
Bart,Thank you.
Bart,Maybe you just put it on auto-reverse.
Bart,Cool!
Bart,"Oh man, I'm too pretty to go to jail. You don't know how lucky you are."
Bart,And I learned that killing a nerd is not as fun as it sounds.
Bart,"Wait in line for a book? You tell 'em Bart says ""Hey""."
Bart,I'm not a nerd -- I'm a jock who's too cool for sports.
Bart,Beef jerky? The queen of all the jerkys!
Bart,I saw this. He trained his dog to do it.
Bart,It's Lisa Kudrow.
Bart,You have a drinking problem?
Bart,Gay out?
Bart,Dad... marinating with you is cool.
Bart,Step into our Jerkatorium.
Bart,What the?!
Bart,J -- Just the product you need. E -- Excellent value. R -- Retailer's dream. K--
Bart,"Well, something chewed through the cellar door... and the floor is covered with paw prints..."
Bart,"Homer, you ate their jerky."
Bart,"Dad, you never win a fight with animals. Remember when you lost that war with the worms?"
Bart,Oh yeah? They made you build this statue.
Bart,"Dad! Dad, a little help?"
Bart,"For the next three days I'm gonna stick to you like waffle syrup on a shag rug. I'm gonna be on you like fish stink on a Gloucester dog. I'm gonna be all over you like-- Hey, where'd she go?"
Bart,What if someone catches him?
Bart,Does that mean I can stop training to be a Mexican wrestler?
Bart,No me gusto. Que lastima.
Bart,"Oh, right. Dad was Colonel Homer and he wore that awesome suit and Lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out! But I forget how Mom felt about it..."
Bart,"Lurleen, this barbecue is delicious."
Bart,Well I think it's wonderful. My diet starts tomor-row!
Bart,Hee-Haw Ho?
Bart,"I don't get it, Lurleen -- how did you lose all your money? Did it go up your nose? Between your toes?"
Bart,"Yeah, all I see is a gut with knees!"
Bart,"All right, I get it, I get it."
Bart,"Fine with me. Look, I packed you a bag."
Bart,No problem. I bought you a hat.
Bart,DADDY'S BACK AND SHE'S FEELIN' LIKE SHE OUGHTER!
Bart,You'd think a house full of crazy people would be fun. It's actually really depressing.
Bart,Mom! We need to throw out all this Krusty cereal and get Robot-Clown cereal!
Bart,It adds yards to any swing!
Bart,I hate the beanbag store. The clerks are always shouting in Hebrew on their cell phones.
Bart,So Dean Martin would show up at the last minute and do everything in just one take?
Bart,But Wikipedia said he was passionate about rehearsal.
Bart,"Hey, check it out!"
Bart,I wouldn't mind driving that over a prairie dog village! Honk to the driver!
Bart,Martin?! What's a tool like you doing on something cool like that?
Bart,4-H club? Is it dangerous?
Bart,"Can I join, Dad? Can I? Can I? Can I?"
Bart,"""I pledge my head to clearer thinking, my heart to greater loyalty, my hands... Man, how many H's does this thing have?"
Bart,"...Raise articulator, set hydraulic brakes and endorse farm subsidy check for crops I didn't grow."
Bart,"Hey, it's the runt. I'll take anything but the runt."
Bart,"Awww... looks like we're partners. You're a scrappy little misfit, just like me... Anyone want to trade? No reasonable offer refused. I'll take a chicken!"
Bart,Keep it down! I'm trying to feed my runt.
Bart,"I'm Bart, and this is my calf, Lulubelle."
Bart,Oh. I thought she was peeing out of her nipple.
Bart,"That's great, it rhymes with ""moo""!"
Bart,"So, what do you think of my calf?"
Bart,You're the greatest cow in the world! I'm gonna be your friend forever!
Bart,Something happens next?
Bart,"Lots of feed, that sounds good."
Bart,But he won! Why don't you kill the loser cows?
Bart,"Mom, they're gonna kill Lou and make him into food and fringe vests for gay cowboys. Can we buy him back? Can we?"
Bart,Oh man.
Bart,Lou?
Bart,"Oh man, now I feel so bad I'm imagining I hear your voice."
Bart,Leave me alone! It's not my fault there's nothing good to eat on this planet except meat!
Bart,I can't help you! I'm just a little boy!
Bart,I hear Lou mooing in my head!
Bart,"If I could save Lou, I'd never eat meat again. Not even prosciutto and melon!"
Bart,Anguished Animals III? That wasn't my conscience mooing -- it was Tress MacNeille!
Bart,"Sorry Lis, I can't be a vegetarian -- I love the taste of death! But please, help me get my cow back."
Bart,Give me a minute.
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Aw, man. I never figured the gate would be locked. It's like they knew we were coming."
Bart,Windsong?
Bart,What's my code name?
Bart,Lou! Lou!
Bart,"Lou! Where are you, little buddy?"
Bart,Lou? What happened to you? You got fat!
Bart,"I don't care how much of a pumped-up freak you are, I still love you. The way Barry Bonds's kids probably still love him."
Bart,How are we gonna get him out of here?
Bart,"Hell, yeah!"
Bart,That was a practice cow.
Bart,What are we gonna do with him?
Bart,"Hmmm, a cow on a farm... With a moo moo here, and a moo moo there... Yes, it works!"
Bart,"All right, Lou! To freedom! Lou?"
Bart,"Oh, I'm Bart Simpson. Is Mary here?"
Bart,I didn't know Cletus was your dad.
Bart,The feedlot wants to kill Lou and I can't keep him. Can I give him to you?
Bart,I can't get married -- I'm only ten!
Bart,D.Q.A.T.?
Bart,"All right, sir, I'll marry your daughter."
Bart,Have you seen my sister?
Bart,Kiss?! I thought we were just getting married!
Bart,I do.
Bart,"Mom, I have to do this! I love that big ol' cow!"
Bart,"No, no, no, no, no -- you look great, honey. Mom, if I don't get married, they'll take Lou."
Bart,"Goodbye, Lou. I'll never forget you."
Bart,"Mom, how could you do this to me?"
Bart,No.
Bart,"Great plan, Mom. But where is Lou gonna go?"
Bart,"Lou, if that plane leaves the ground and you're not on it, you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and definitely after they kill you and make you into sloppy Joes."
Bart,"Here's looking at you, cud."
Bart,"You're in a better place now, Lou. I'll always be proud for once in my life... I had a cow, man."
Bart,Why do we have to get here so early? The football game doesn't start for hours.
Bart,"No, everything is better."
Bart,Anything! / Everything! / Anything! / Everything!
Bart,It's just forks and plates. Didn't we bring any food?
Bart,You brought us here to beg?
Bart,Smithers and Burns?
Bart,"Ew, Lisa, make them stop!"
Bart,I've never seen them before.
Bart,"You did, Dad."
Bart,"Lisa, your movie exposed our crappy side to the world. I knew you were lame, but I never imagined you were bogus."
Bart,Monsters! Monsters! Monsters!
Bart,Let's just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it's nice for the next people.
Bart,I know! We'll be in another movie -- and this time we'll act really bad!
Bart,We thought this was gonna be a fun trip to the mall!
Bart,Lead-based toys! Lead-based toys!
Bart,Maggie's thing? She won't even remember that we did it!
Bart,Like what?
Bart,Pass.
Bart,That dump?
Bart,I wouldn't blow my nose into this.
Bart,Bart is awesome.
Bart,Wow -- this guy could put Milhouse out of business.
Bart,"Yes, sir!"
Bart,"Who cares? If you kill him, we'll be on TV!"
Bart,When did he lose his cuteness?
Bart,"Okay, comforting, comforting... Uh Dad, whenever I would hang out with Grandma, she would always ask me about you. And I'd say you suck, and she would say... you don't suck that bad."
Bart,That bad.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Cool.
Bart,You got nothing! You got nothing!
Bart,"Hey, Homer! Your butt still looks big from down here!"
Bart,"Homer! Hey, Homer!"
Bart,Here's Gramma's knife!
Bart,I am so gonna try out for that!
Bart,"No, I hope you get it."
Bart,"Yeah, I hope I get it too. Later!"
Bart,For my first impression...
Bart,I'm a lantern fish.
Bart,Now I'm a Jack-O-lantern...
Bart,E.T.
Bart,B.E.T.
Bart,I can't believe I lost.
Bart,I can't believe you're working for Krusty and I'm not. I know everything about that clown. Favorite blintz -- blueberry. Favorite horse in the 2004 Belmont -- Smarty Jones. Krusty lost a bundle and had to endorse baby wipes in Norway. Which I have a case of!
Bart,"Lisa's got school, career, posture -- why'd she have to steal Krusty from me?!"
Bart,"""The Inverted Double-struck Penny, or 'Kissing Lincolns'..."""
Bart,I don't know why I agreed to this.
Bart,"Okay, here's my offer -- all this primo Krusty merchandise for that copy of ""Radioactive Man vs. Muhammad Ali""."
Bart,"How 'bout ""Radioactive Man versus Restless Leg Syndrome""?"
Bart,Am I?! No.
Bart,"All right, time to fill these slots with coins. Specific coins? This hobby sucks!"
Bart,"Wow, I never thought of it like that."
Bart,You bet I do.
Bart,Slide in the eighteen sixty-three confederate half-dime... and every slot is full.
Bart,"""...was mistakenly minted in December of 1917, when a brief glimpse of a woman's ankle caused three days of rioting at the Philadelphia Mint."""
Bart,One of these has got to be that smooching Lincoln penny.
Bart,Nope... Nope... Dime... Button... Pepperoni slice...
Bart,Nope... Nope... Nope...
Bart,Dad?
Bart,"Now, let's put it on a shelf and never look at it again."
Bart,Woo hoo! St. Patrick's Day!
Bart,I love how they made the river green!
Bart,Where's the I.R.A. when you need 'em?
Bart,Two kinds of Irish people? What are they fighting over? Who gets to sleep in the bathtub?
Bart,Whoa! There's still bullets in some of these!
Bart,Yes sir!
Bart,You're right!
Bart,Missed out? I didn't miss out. What'd I miss out on?
Bart,I wish I had a cell phone.
Bart,"What, do you think I'm crazy?"
Bart,"Mom, even Milhouse has a cell phone! Your son is lamer than Milhouse! What does that say about you?!"
Bart,I'm never gonna get a cell phone.
Bart,How am I ever gonna get a cell phone?
Bart,Is this your ball?
Bart,Don't tell me where I go. A dollar? What for?
Bart,"So I can get a dollar for every ball I find?! Then if a cell phone costs one hundred dollars, how many balls do I need?"
Bart,"Wow, I'm just twenty balls away from a cell phone!"
Bart,Groundskeeper Willie?
Bart,This phone belongs to Denis Leary!
Bart,I'm never gonna get a cell phone!
Bart,Huh? A cell phone!
Bart,It's mine! Cool! And you can even watch commercials on it.
Bart,"Hey Milhouse, guess where I'm calling from?"
Bart,Look outside your window.
Bart,Just do it!
Bart,That felt good.
Bart,"Hello?... you want Denis Leary? Wrong number, dumbass."
Bart,I'm a big fan.
Bart,Sure -- on one condition. I wanna do my own poops.
Bart,Of course I'll do it for minimum. Great. I'll see you next Monday in Tunisia.
Bart,Yo. Who's this?
Bart,That's right! Let's call his business manager and tell him to spend all his money on Yankees hats and Derek Jeter jerseys.
Bart,"Naw, he's cool. He's gonna think this is hilarious."
Bart,"Milhouse, I hold in this hand Denis Leary's cell phone. And in this hand, the phone numbers of bars around the world. Let's start with Hawaii."
Bart,Aloha to you! I'm looking for Maya. Last name Normousbutt.
Bart,The sun never sets on the Bartish Empire.
Bart,"Which one, the one that got canceled or the one that's gonna get canceled?"
Bart,"Same way you got me: by accident, on a golf course."
Bart,You'll never get it out of me.
Bart,Wait a minute. I thought you said I couldn't have this.
Bart,"Awesome, another call."
Bart,"Lady, you are the best Mom ever!"
Bart,"Sure, I got my seatbelt on."
Bart,"Uh, trying to do something constructive?"
Bart,I'll just take Milhouse home.
Bart,Shhh! I'm listening to financing terms for double-glazed windows.
Bart,You got Bart!
Bart,They're spying on me?! That's horrible!
Bart,Hold that thought. I'm getting a text.
Bart,"Viagra at five dollars a pill? Whatever it is, it's goin' in Skinner's coffee."
Bart,"Track this, Mom and Dad."
Bart,Looks like I've got the house to myself for a while.
Bart,"I can do anything I want! First I'm gonna take a bath, then I'm gonna eat some vegetables, and then I'm gonna get to bed nice and early with no TV."
Bart,"Yeah. And I think they may be gone a while longer. Ooh, it looks like the grilled Twizzlers are ready."
Bart,"Mmm, oh yeah, this baby is done."
Bart,You sure you don't wanna stay and have a sleepover? I made sleepover shirts.
Bart,"Oh man... when you're alone, night is scary."
Bart,Day is awesome!
Bart,Night is scary.
Bart,Day is awesome!
Bart,Night is scary...
Bart,Hey.
Bart,Were you guys gone?
Bart,I didn't even notice.
Bart,Never leave again.
Bart,Look at me! I'm doin' something!
Bart,"Dad, look at me! Look at me!"
Bart,Cannonball!
Bart,Again!
Bart,I thought it was fifty.
Bart,"Don't waste your shot, Bart. You've got just enough cat pee to soak two dorks."
Bart,Uh... it was water this morning.
Bart,They're not boogers! They're clumps of rubber cement. That I stored in my nose.
Bart,"Yes, ma'am."
Bart,A vacuuming robot!
Bart,"Kill, kill, kill!"
Bart,Uh... I can explain...
Bart,You already did that.
Bart,That too.
Bart,What? You can't take my Balderdash!
Bart,I don't mean to be bad. I don't know why I do the things I do.
Bart,No one understands me. I wish I had a different family.
Bart,Oh my God! You look like a dorky version of me!
Bart,This is my bedroom?!
Bart,Woosterfield? Your family owns this place! And Woosterfield Arena! Bonnie Raitt played there! You guys must be loaded!
Bart,Terrific? Incredible? Happy as a clown?
Bart,"Hm, I don't know. I'm pretty attached to my family, and..."
Bart,Deal.
Bart,"My father's name is Homer... my mother's name is Mom... my sister's name is Lisa, but everyone calls her Loser."
Bart,Lipizzaner... got it.
Bart,"Thank you, uh, Lipizzaner."
Bart,"Driver, laugh at those people for me."
Bart,"McMansion, McMansion..."
Bart,"McMansion, McDonalds, McDreamy, McSteamy, McMansion, Fleetwood Mac, and MacCauley Culkin."
Bart,Awesome!
Bart,Awesome!
Bart,Awesome!
Bart,Meh.
Bart,A candy corn volcano! A ceiling from Saddam's palace!
Bart,"Ooh, and a racecar bed...that really races!"
Bart,"Wow, a cool poster of Joe Montana!"
Bart,"Back in the poster, gabby."
Bart,"Milhouse, it's me. Check out the caller I.D. on your phone."
Bart,Just sit tight -- I'm sending a car.
Bart,This must be my half-brother and half-sister!
Bart,Ow! The ol' hot spoon. But why?
Bart,"Oh, now I get it."
Bart,You had a crush on my old sister.
Bart,Oh yeah? Well what's up with your brother and sister?
Bart,"Eh, you lost me. Well, gotta go -- enjoy the upper-lower middle class!"
Bart,Fancy party! This is like a rap video before the rappers show up.
Bart,Whoa! Let me at it!
Bart,Help! Let me out! I have my doubts about this licorice!
Bart,"Oh, Mr. Burns! I'm really sorry!"
Bart,You were once the youngest of something?
Bart,"Wow, only you survived which means the entire fortune went to you."
Bart,Devon and Quenly?
Bart,Oh my God. Simon set me up. And all this time I thought he wanted the life of a stranger he met in the bathroom.
Bart,Why won't you come down?!
Bart,"Come on, Bart, you've gotta get outta here. Pack like you've never packed before. You know, I have never packed before."
Bart,This is hard!
Bart,Heard what?
Bart,Ski trip?
Bart,Uh... this trail is for experienced skiers.
Bart,"I never thought I'd say this, but I missed you guys. Even what's her name, Lisa."
Bart,This is the life.
Bart,I can't listen to this anymore.
Bart,"Yes, sir."
Bart,I'm cuckoo for killing stuff!
Bart,"A log cabin? What am I, Davy Crockett? Also, who's Davy Crockett?"
Bart,"Well, leaving right now will become a special memory for me."
Bart,Pedal cars su-uck!
Bart,And we'll stay up forever!
Bart,I'll tell you what's lost: your sense of adventure.
Bart,"Lisa, do you know why I spend every day after school in detention? So I don't have to come home to you!"
Bart,It's out there. Deal with it!
Bart,I told you we should have left her with your mother!
Bart,We grew up.
Bart,Great gig.
Bart,"Hey, you guys want a lift in my pedal boat?"
Bart,How'd you like a shortcut to the bottom of the river?
Bart,Knock it off back there.
Bart,"Okay, but keep it PG."
Bart,PG-13.
Bart,Lemonade! Sweet sunshine in your mouth! Buy a cup or I punch my sister!
Bart,Maybe we should put a dollar in the jar. Prime the pump.
Bart,"Don't worry, folks. Our master chef is stirring up a fresh batch."
Bart,Thirty-five cents? Where did that come from? Can't be mine -- must be yours.
Bart,Ay Carumba!
Bart,It finally happened -- you've gone completely fruit loops.
Bart,"No, I mean you're loco in the coco!"
Bart,You're losin' it!
Bart,"Fine, go nuts -- see if I care!"
Bart,Speaking of San Francisco people mover:
Bart,Who's driving the bus?
Bart,Lisa got hustled!
Bart,"Boy, Dad seems awfully happy."
Bart,"Hey, those are fifteen month calendars! That gives you three extra kittens!"
Bart,That's the last time I get you guys a Christmas present at the last minute.
Bart,"Man, those are ugly kittens."
Bart,You're all losers!
Bart,"You think you're cool because you buy a five hundred dollar phone with a picture of a fruit on it?! Well, guess what? They cost eight bucks to make and I pee on every one!"
Bart,I have made a fortune off you chumps -- and I've invested it all in Microsoft! Now my boyfriend Bill Gates and I kiss each other on a pile of your money!
Bart,MyCube! Take me away!
Bart,Stupid angry mob... chasing me because I shine a harsh light on modern society. Now I know how Dane Cook feels.
Bart,"Mmm, what's that exotic aroma? It smells like a hamburger cooked at a rug store."
Bart,Whoa. All these years I've been petting lambs when I should've been shoving them in my mouth. I'm Bart.
Bart,"Jordan. That's on some map somewhere, right?"
Bart,"Bashir, you didn't tell me you had a sister."
Bart,"Hey, I never refuse food from strangers."
Bart,"Okay, you're new to our school, so here's the deal: we call Skinner, ""Skin-rash,"" Mr. Wiener is ""Mr. Whiner,"" and Groundskeeper Willie, ""Grounds-creeper Stupid."""
Bart,"Okay, next, here's the food at the cafeteria that will make you sick: coleslaw, tuna, all chowders and gumbos. The only thing that's safe is the pork chops."
Bart,"A different religion? Do not tell anyone that, because if the bullies around here find out that you're different--"
Bart,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't just whale on him because he's... what religion are you anyway?"
Bart,Hoo boy.
Bart,"Look guys, everyone's different. Jimbo, you're Christian. Dolph, you're Jewish. And Kearney, your family's in that cult Moe started."
Bart,Salaam alaikum.
Bart,"Dad, that's Bashir -- my new friend."
Bart,"Dad! These people are my friends! Don't fear them just because they have a different religion, a different culture, and their last name is Bin Laden!"
Bart,I can't believe your dad gets paid to blow stuff up.
Bart,Did you factor in one bald idiot?
Bart,"Dad, it was an empty building. It was supposed to come down!"
Bart,"She said something about ""the bottom of the ocean"" and ""be back in a month."""
Bart,Why would I want to?
Bart,My nards accept!
Bart,Can I appeal?
Bart,"Relax, Mom. I'll mold them into a shape you know and love."
Bart,"Um Mom, maybe you shouldn't have put so much syrup on the pancakes."
Bart,Yeah!
Bart,Why do we have to go to the rec center? I wanna play with my friends!
Bart,"Pardon me, master, but what does a big fat wad like you know about kung fu?"
Bart,M&Ms?
Bart,How about Charleston Chew?
Bart,"You ask for my help, then you don't want it."
Bart,"If she doesn't like coconut, you're screwed!"
Bart,Won't last.
Bart,We could be murderers.
Bart,Nice doorbell. Is it computerized?
Bart,Ow.
Bart,"Bart Simpson, age ten."
Bart,"If I know my sister, and unfortunately I do, she probably ran off to some lame-o make-believe castle."
Bart,Re-jected!
Bart,Ladies and gentlemen: Fallout boy!
Bart,"Homer, that guy's your age?"
Bart,What about Sunday?
Bart,He looks happy.
Bart,"I already knew that, Dad. I'm gonna blame you."
Bart,With a virgin Tom Collins for me?
Bart,"Yeah, I can actually see your hands. They're not just a blur."
Bart,Not even when she's snorkeling.
Bart,Slurp my snot.
Bart,How long has he been there?
Bart,"Dad, we need to have a talk."
Bart,"Dad, we think the sauce had it all wrong."
Bart,"Plaques come, plaques go."
Bart,I hear there's a Korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death.
Bart,What are you doing?
Bart,I can't believe we have to start another year of school. I never learned anything at that suck shack.
Bart,Kid at school.
Bart,"I wrote ""Slurp My Snot"" in the ovals on the answer sheet. True story."
Bart,You can't teach this way!
Bart,What kind of pencil do we take again?
Bart,Looks like you took a big number two.
Bart,No test?
Bart,"Well, it's about time."
Bart,Wait a minute. This ain't no genius copter. This is con air!
Bart,Stop it! All of you!
Bart,Don't you get it? There is no pizza party. This isn't a helicopter.
Bart,Told ya.
Bart,Doy. Doy. Doy. Doy.
Bart,"Hey Seymour, I just realized something. You're stuck babysitting us losers which makes you the real loser!"
Bart,Ay carumba.
Bart,"What's your plan now, Skinrash?"
Bart,"Sure thing, Such."
Bart,"No, sir."
Bart,Just don't stretch it out.
Bart,There's twelve more boxes. And they all sound the same!
Bart,What about my birthday party?
Bart,She is. Look.
Bart,Evil triumphs again.
Bart,Ow!
Bart,I died when Homer sat on me!
Bart,"Yeah, without the sun, my hair's reverting to its natural red."
Bart,"I don't want to be called ""Rusty"" again! I don't!"
Bart,Family outing? I'll start -- Lisa's gay!
Bart,"We know, Dad. We were there."
Bart,I hate this place -- the clothes they gave us are the clothes we gave to charity last year.
Bart,But kicking is the only toy I have.
Bart,I'm gonna see it first!
Bart,"Hit the road, ya big load!"
Bart,But Dr. Hibbert said not to stress her out.
Bart,"Step aside, ladies -- I'm bringin' the peace!"
Bart,I am so staying up past my bedtime.
Bart,A Home and Garden Show?!
Bart,"Mom, you said we were going to a videogame expo!"
Bart,Oh my God. Look over there!
Bart,Classic hose-play.
Bart,I can have all my birthday parties in it!
Bart,Now I know why lobsters let out that joyful squeal when they're dropped in the pot.
Bart,"Come on, man. Baptize your buns!"
Bart,One of us should go look at it.
Bart,Oh yeah. / That's it.
Bart,"In your face, Belgium!"
Bart,"No, I'll be good!"
Bart,"I'll have one drink, one cocktail and one booze, please."
Bart,"Hey, I just spent ten hours on a plane. I'm stayin' here. They've got German ""Krusty"" on TV!"
Bart,Such a beautiful language.
Bart,"K-I/S-S-M-Y/A-S-S spells ""kiss my ass""!"
Bart,Fresh!
Bart,"Hm, let me make a note of that."
Bart,What you're saying is we've run out of fun things to do.
Bart,So you and Mom aren't married? Does that mean I'm a bastard?
Bart,"Yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock."
Bart,"This one's a little gay, isn't it?"
Bart,"Hey, I found something!"
Bart,"Because he knows that if Mom and Dad don't get married, I'll never be born!"
Bart,"Bob, did you take any breaks yesterday... to kidnap our dad?"
Bart,"What she means is, we'll eat your cookies later. If you don't want us to tell our Mom what you did, you're gonna have to pay."
Bart,"Ask her, she's the brains. I'm the thing that's not brains."
Bart,"She seems upset. Maybe if I lay down a beat on my bongos, that'll soothe her."
Bart,Did you unscrew all the Phillips heads?
Bart,Yep. And now we wait.
Bart,"Now, go hide the evidence while I walk around saying ""What happened? Who would do such a thing?"""
Bart,"Thanks for not selling me out, man."
Bart,"Look, I gotta go. But don't worry, I'll visit you every day. I promise."
Bart,"So Grampa, not like I'm anxious to go, but I've been here ten minutes, which is like seven hours in kid years..."
Bart,Huh?
Bart,"I think it is so cool what you are doing. So what's the gag? You put ex-lax in the cookies, then just sit back and watch the fireworks?"
Bart,"Oh, right. Um, I was thinking of other things that are hilarious. Like... things that you think are funny."
Bart,Yeah. I'm Bart.
Bart,"Oh my God, how long was I zoned out?"
Bart,Jenny. Fifth grade girl.
Bart,"When she talks to me, I feel like a better person."
Bart,"Hey, Jenny."
Bart,"Boy, you make it look effortless. And that kid's giving you zero pump."
Bart,"Hey, do you want to go on a picnic tomorrow? You'd love my P.B. and J. The secret is, no P.B., double J."
Bart,"Yes!!! Willie, I've got a girlfriend!"
Bart,"Hey, that's great."
Bart,Uh... I...
Bart,"I spend a lot of time working with this mentally-challenged guy. Why, here he is now. Lookin' good, Homer!"
Bart,Just wait.
Bart,"Do you know who else was really into rowboats? Jesus. And he could've turned his rowboat into a jet ski, but he didn't. Good guy."
Bart,Those bullies are gonna kill me! Why am I doing this?
Bart,"Oh, yeah."
Bart,"Please, guys, give me a break. Can you give me the duckling without beating me up?"
Bart,"C'mon, I'm trying to impress a girl."
Bart,"Mom, can I get those dishes for you?"
Bart,No angle.
Bart,"Um, if this girl I'm seeing comes here, and she might, I wouldn't mind if you told her I was the kind of boy that does the dishes."
Bart,"So this is setting the table. If I'd known how easy this was, I'd have just done it instead of throwing all those tantrums."
Bart,Uh... it's not an easy thing to admit.
Bart,Uh... well...
Bart,"We don't have any money! Go away! May I de-corn your cob, my darling?"
Bart,"Yeah, I meant to, I've just been sooo busy. My schedule has been all like ."
Bart,"Yes, because only by knowing them can you prevent bad little kids from saying them."
Bart,What do you want from me?!
Bart,"Milhouse, real best friends often don't speak for years at a time. Like John Adams and Thomas Jefferson."
Bart,"Look, man. I have to keep my dark past hidden. There's someone new in my life now."
Bart,My who?
Bart,Sorry I'm late. I didn't realize you had to turn the oven on to bake stuff.
Bart,"Are you nuts?! Milhouse will spill everything. By which I mean juice, not secrets!"
Bart,We should be safe from Milhouse here. Being at sea level gives him nosebleeds.
Bart,I'm tired of talking about Milhouse!
Bart,"Milhouse, could you stop being creepy for just a minute?"
Bart,"Jenny, I can't take the pressure anymore. I have to come clean. I'm only pretending to be good..."
Bart,"Before I met you, I was El Barto, Skinner's Bane, the Sultan of Spitwads, the Dean of D-minus, the Ay carumba Kid!"
Bart,But now I'm good because you turned me good. Isn't that all that matters?
Bart,Not our entire relationship. Just the stuff I said.
Bart,I can't believe she dumped me!
Bart,"Hit me again, 'Pu."
Bart,You're right. I've gotta straighten this out.
Bart,"How much for these roses, Apu?"
Bart,I am so sorry I tried to deny who I really was. You deserve better. I'll never hurt you again. Can you forgive me?
Bart,"You've always been there for me, man. I'll never turn my back on you again."
Bart,"Milhouse, whaddaya say to a make-up prank?"
Bart,"Smooth and slippery. Thank you, Zamboni King."
Bart,Cue music.
Bart,"And, cue snow."
Bart,Maybe we should just check out the street performers.
Bart,"Dad, yes!"
Bart,"Dad, what are you doing here?"
Bart,What? No!
Bart,"Dad, do you have to hang out at my school? It's bad enough I have to be here three days a week!"
Bart,No.
Bart,La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Bart,I'unno.
Bart,The Washington Monument?
Bart,"We'd like some balsa wood, please."
Bart,Isn't this supposed to be my project?
Bart,Do you want me to watch and learn?
Bart,No! Stop the hovering!
Bart,I didn't make this terrible model... my dad did.
Bart,"Why can't you guys let us do things for ourselves. In the words of Oscar Wilde: ""Experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes."" I saw him too, Dad."
Bart,Lousy teachers.
Bart,"Wait, wait, wait. You're putting us in a new school?! What about my friends?"
Bart,"Oh my God, look what they serve in the cafeteria!"
Bart,"Not to worry, at this school, we've got a clean slate. In fact, I'm establishing my cred right now."
Bart,A deal's a deal.
Bart,"Fine. I want one gift bag now, and one when the party's over."
Bart,"Now to turn my sis from ""loser"" to ""schmoozer."""
Bart,"Que pasa, ladies?"
Bart,"Don't tell anyone, but my sister Lisa is best friends with Alaska Nebraska."
Bart,Duh. She said that because she respects Alaska's privacy. Just as I have no doubt you guys will respect Lisa's privacy.
Bart,My plan was to lie. Lie like hell. And that's what I did.
Bart,"I've gotta get back, too! I just remembered I was playing hide and seek with Milhouse."
Bart,Get a room!
Bart,But...
Bart,"Milhouse, watch me make a loser lose it."
Bart,"Excuse me, I just heard that before Spider-Man was a movie it was a comic book. Is that possible?"
Bart,"Ooh, twelve cents. I'll take eight!"
Bart,Huh. What's this?
Bart,It was a typical day for delivery man Avery Mann. Until...
Bart,You made this?
Bart,"Actually, I like it."
Bart,Have you shown this to anyone?
Bart,Don't be afraid of them. They're just Lame-os like yourself.
Bart,Comic Book Guy's been writing these for years. Who knew a troubled person could be creative?
Bart,Dr. Hibbert found out my thyroid isn't pumping out enough--
Bart,That was awesome!
Bart,"You know, Krabappel just needs to chill out and realize life is cool. But how?"
Bart,"Hmm... You know, my dad is a lot more fun after a few beers."
Bart,"Maybe Mrs. K would be nicer if we ""Irish"" up her coffee."
Bart,"No, booze. First the easy part: kids, get some liquor."
Bart,Relax. Hazelnut creamer covers all sins.
Bart,You look tired. Maybe you need some more coffee.
Bart,Uh-oh. Do you think we went too far?
Bart,"All thanks to... ""The Answer""!"
Bart,I never wanted her to get fired.
Bart,Maybe I should tell Skinner that it was our...
Bart,Our cell phones!
Bart,"...then Zack Skyped us, live-blogged our spelling bee, and friended us on Facebook!"
Bart,You mean the L-man-D-dog flame wars?
Bart,"Oh, no worries. I heard on the four-square court she's doin' great."
Bart,Oh sure... it's sorta on my way home. I can check up on the old girl. She probably landed a job at some fancy-schmancy prep school.
Bart,Mrs. K? Is everything all right?
Bart,It's the movie. It's so funny.
Bart,Sorry. Sorry.
Bart,"Mrs. K., you've gotta get outta here. When was the last time you washed your hair?"
Bart,"Well, that's better than me. But still, you've gotta get out."
Bart,Milhouse... we ruined Edna's life. Maybe we can get her job back.
Bart,There's got to be some other way to help Mrs. K.
Bart,Bookstores don't have answers. They just have creepy guys sitting in easy chairs at the end of aisleways.
Bart,"What's ""The Answer?"""
Bart,"So, um, you're wearing the same bathrobe you were the last time I was here. That's cool."
Bart,"Well, Mrs. K. I have just the book slash DVD for you. ""The Answer."""
Bart,This book uses the ancient power of wanting.
Bart,"Hey... ""Just because we don't understand electricity, doesn't mean we can't enjoy its benefits."""
Bart,Cut it out. You're not a teacher anymore.
Bart,"Look, Mrs. K, I'm a Simpson. And a Simpson never gives up until he's tried at least one easy thing. Let me help you."
Bart,"So, did you write your dream on the index card of fate?"
Bart,I want to own a muffin store. Great idea! Now let's see...
Bart,"""Break your dream down into smaller 'wishes,' then break those down into 'wish-able actions.'"""
Bart,Loony? Would a loony self-help book come with a magic question mark inside?
Bart,Eh? Eh? Eh?
Bart,"Nothing, nothing."
Bart,My pleasure.
Bart,"Beats me, I just gave him a banana."
Bart,Yep. I'm off the hook now.
Bart,"Well, I guess I can tell you... 'cause everything worked out for the best..."
Bart,"Well, it's funny, really. I'm the one who put booze in your coffee and got you fired."
Bart,Please don't kill me.
Bart,But this place was your dream!
Bart,Noooo!
Bart,"But-but-but, you found ""The Answer!"""
Bart,Nooo! I wrote a phone number in there!
Bart,Dad... am I bad on the inside?
Bart,"But you think there's like a kernel of good inside me, right?"
Bart,"Listen... I was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?"
Bart,"No, I mean teacher."
Bart,What discussion?
Bart,"...so you see, it was my fault. I got Mrs. Krabappel drunk. And then I was gonna do the same thing to Zack, but I decided it was better to just tell the truth."
Bart,"Doesn't matter, as long as Edna gets her job back."
Bart,I didn't. I swear!
Bart,And there's no hard feelings?
Bart,But it's stale.
Bart,"Thanks for bringing me here, Dad. I'll remember this day on my deathbed."
Bart,Whoa. Maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang.
Bart,"Sir, could you sign my program with a swear word?"
Bart,"But Mom, I'm winning! Look at this! His lunch money!"
Bart,I was just doing the moves I learned from Ultimate Punching!
Bart,"Mom, don't do this! This sport is as fun for me as having kids is for you!"
Bart,"Tell her, Dad! You love Ultimate Punching even more than I do!"
Bart,What the?
Bart,"Chocolate, whipped cream... cherries! She got to you! With a piece of black forest cake!"
Bart,Glad you didn't come cheap.
Bart,Nothin'.
Bart,"Mom, you can't fight that guy."
Bart,Or kick the crap out of you.
Bart,"Oh man, now she's writing cutesy things with the ribbon."
Bart,"And Mom, if you punch him in the junk, you'll get no disrespect from me."
Bart,"Hit my Mom, will ya? Well, I'm gonna knock you out and moon your corpse."
Bart,"Mom, that's a beautiful thought."
Bart,"Hey, Lis."
Bart,I don't know when we'll be in a septagon again. Wanna settle this bad blood that's been going on between us since you were born?
Bart,I heard about your run-in with Hoover. Aren't teachers the worst?
Bart,"Listen, you're a smart kid. I bet you like ideas."
Bart,"Well, I just had a whopper! What if you got revenge on Krabappel for me, and I got revenge on Hoover for you? Crisscross!"
Bart,Exactly. Crisscross! Do we have a deal?
Bart,"If I say ""crisscross"" one more time, will that change your mind?"
Bart,Crisscross!
Bart,Yep. I'm at the tennis match.
Bart,I'm pretty sure they will.
Bart,"And you should've seen the look on Hoover's face. In fact, here it is."
Bart,Right. Like we agreed.
Bart,"Yeah, 'cause you're smart. You don't say ""kill,"" you say ""prank."" Like Mom and Dad say ""snuggle"" when what they really mean is ""let's lock the door and hug."""
Bart,So all you did was ring her doorbell and run?
Bart,"""Ding-dong-ditch"" means you kill her, then you throw that ding-dong into a ditch. Geez, pick up a book."
Bart,"A deal's a deal, little sister. Tomorrow after school, go to her house and t.p. her."
Bart,"Yeah, torture and pulverize her. Then ding-dong-ditch the body and we're even."
Bart,Slice her like a bagel!
Bart,I've been waiting for you -- and trying to figure out how girls pee.
Bart,"No dice -- either take care of Krabappel, or Groundskeeper Willie will say he saw you kill Miss Hoover."
Bart,Let's just say... he owes me a favor.
Bart,You're not wearin' a kilt.
Bart,"Go ahead, do it. You're no different from me. We're made from the same dinna."
Bart,The munchers got Moe!
Bart,Hungry. So hungry. There's nothing to eat. Except this.
Bart,There's gotta be something yummy out there.
Bart,A hamburger!
Bart,Wait! The burger didn't change me! I'm not a muncher!
Bart,Let's play a game: who gets to carry the chosen one?
Bart,Ow!
Bart,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it.
Bart,"Where do you want it, the mouth or the eyes?"
Bart,Eyes it is.
Bart,"Hey, Lis. Want some soup?"
Bart,"Quit dragging me. When I grow up, I'm gonna drag you around and buy you clothes."
Bart,Knock it off! That's my Mom you're talkin' about.
Bart,"Okay, buddy. Lower the eyebrows. Nice and easy."
Bart,Shut up!
Bart,And I'm having a stink bomb party at the house next to Janey's. No connection.
Bart,"Dad, how can you call it a ski weekend if we're going home at dawn on Sunday?"
Bart,No problem. A couple just rolled out from behind your seat.
Bart,Not to worry. It plugs into this cigarette lighter.
Bart,"So, you guys have any videogames?"
Bart,Set 'em up again!
Bart,Is that a pentagram? Lis! You've finally come over to the dark side.
Bart,"No, no, no. You're too young to be a witch. Savor the steps leading up to it: college anorexic, string of bad marriages, career disappointments, failed pottery shop. And then when you're old and alone, you can hit the witch thing hard."
Bart,"Your honor, I'd like to enter something into the record."
Bart,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am a big dummy with a stupid job. I write down what other people say just like a big dummy would. Could the court reporter read that back?"
Bart,"Yeah, yeah, miracles are all around us. Now please, I am trying to hear the school closings."
Bart,"Oh, for cryin' out loud!"
Bart,Snow day!
Bart,What the?
Bart,Good grief.
Bart,"Headshot! / Headshot! / Ooh, right in the carrot! / Headshot!"
Bart,Huh?
Bart,Fine. I'll see what's on TV.
Bart,"All right, I'll watch a DVD."
Bart,There's no way that runs on electricity.
Bart,Really? Does Obama know about this?
Bart,I can't believe this is how pilgrims lived.
Bart,I... wanna play with you guys.
Bart,Hello Kitty? I thought they were Spider-Man heads! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Bart,Stupid shoes over tights! Why did I want to play with a couple of lame-o girls?
Bart,"I don't need a brother. I'm a badass loner like Wolverine, who leaves whenever people beg him not to leave."
Bart,I don't need a brother... and no dream will convince me I do.
Bart,"Oh my God, I want a brother!"
Bart,Dad... I want a baby brother.
Bart,Lisa got a sister! Why can't you have another boy?
Bart,You never told me how my body works.
Bart,My Dad is such a jerk. I want a brother and he said no.
Bart,"Trick 'em, I like it. But how?"
Bart,A romantic dinner? That's a great idea!
Bart,Hope you saved room for passion fruit soufflé with crème anglais for two.
Bart,And one for mom.
Bart,Are you sure this'll work?
Bart,So it kinda works...
Bart,"Look, I want a baby brother, but I can't get my parents to do it."
Bart,The pill? What's that?
Bart,"Well, I need a baby now and I'm not getting any younger!"
Bart,Got it. How can I thank you?
Bart,Don't you wanna do it?
Bart,Mom'll never know...
Bart,"I just wanted a baby brother, but Dad said I was one ""Uday"" who didn't need a ""Qusay."" I just wanted what Lisa and Maggie have."
Bart,What about what I want? I'd help you take care of him.
Bart,"Oh my God, the hamsters!"
Bart,Another sister!
Bart,You're right -- I can't risk another girl. Use whatever birth control you want. It's your body.
Bart,"One boy to go, please. Easy on the freckles."
Bart,"Oh, you think he's for me! You know, the orphan is for my folks -- they can't have more kids. It is so sad -- a real-life Jaws bit off my dad's wiener."
Bart,"C'mon, I'd be an awesome big brother! I've got videogames! A treehouse! A garage stuffed to the rafters with illegal fireworks!"
Bart,I'd give my brother everything I have! He could be the race car in Monopoly! Monopoly! The race car!
Bart,I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Bart,"Are you from the orphanage, or do I really not understand how babies are born?"
Bart,"So, Charlie, how did you escape the island of misfit boys?"
Bart,You like to shinny? I like to shinny. Where do you see yourself in twenty years?
Bart,Nice! Favorite Beatle?
Bart,Me too!
Bart,There must be some reason no one ever adopted you. Is one of your feet a hand?
Bart,Babies? We've got one of those. Overrated.
Bart,"Shop it somewhere else, sister."
Bart,"Dad, this is Charlie, my new, um, best friend."
Bart,You're gonna be seeing a lot of him around the house.
Bart,"Yo! Check out my brother, Charlie!"
Bart,"Uh, he was born with two noses and we hid him away till we could afford to cut one off."
Bart,"When poking a dead animal, don't go straight for the eye. Build up to it."
Bart,"Be cool, be cool -- he's an orphan. You know, just like Annie, except he's a dude and he hates tomorrow."
Bart,"You're just jealous 'cause now I've got what you've got with Maggie, only better because we're dudes with 'tudes!"
Bart,"Awesome -- they made a sequel to ""Sever Four!"" This movie's gonna be great! Full of blood and gore and torture and guts and..."
Bart,"Two kid's tickets for ""The Diversity Kittens."""
Bart,...and murder and swears and brains and basements...
Bart,...and bones and saws and lungs and faces worn as hats...
Bart,"Now you probably think Sever Five is a rip-off of Sever Four, but it's actually based on the rich history of Hong Kong torture films."
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,I'm sorry. I guess having a little brother is more responsibility than I thought. Especially 'cause I thought it'd be no responsibility at all.
Bart,There's no such thing as a boogeyman!
Bart,"Charlie, you'd rat on me?"
Bart,Awesome fake-out!
Bart,"Sorry dude, I didn't see you."
Bart,I'unno.
Bart,The same place Eskimos hide from penguins.
Bart,"Now Charlie, we have to live off what we find in the garbage: banana strings, muffin liners, but it'll be cool, 'cause it's just you and me."
Bart,How did you find us?
Bart,Are you gonna turn us in?
Bart,Never!
Bart,Snow. God's cotton candy.
Bart,Snow!
Bart,Don't worry. Me and Charlie have one thing you'll never have.
Bart,"Point and shoot, bro. Point and shoot."
Bart,"Hey, you're alive, aren't you?"
Bart,I'm here to visit Charlie.
Bart,I'm gonna take stuff from the lost and found!
Bart,Not that stupid stuffed lamb again. This isn't learning!
Bart,"No, no, no. I'm just sayin'..."
Bart,"Hey, the only thing I bring home are notes to my parents, and those do not arrive the way that they left."
Bart,"That's it, boy -- go for the nards!"
Bart,How come you don't get mad when I torment real animals?
Bart,I thought you Hindus were supposed to love everybody.
Bart,"Okay, I need the stupid lamb back."
Bart,This isn't Larry. It's just cotton balls on toilet paper rolls! Where's the real Larry?
Bart,"Of course I don't, but other people do!"
Bart,Swiped it from gym class.
Bart,Put the rope in your teeth!
Bart,It'll shut you up!
Bart,Larry? Larry the Lamb?
Bart,"There you are, you piece of crap."
Bart,There's rats in my pants!
Bart,It's dark down here.
Bart,"Hey, Slimu!"
Bart,"Yeah, you better run!"
Bart,Sewer cats!
Bart,Larry!
Bart,"Larry, you saved my life! You're the most wonderful stuffed lamb in the world! I'm sorry about the mean things I said. We'll have the rest of the weekend to--"
Bart,Larrrrry!
Bart,/ Hilarious!
Bart,I concur.
Bart,Some rainbow -- there's no violet.
Bart,"Hey, don't listen to me! What do I know about rainbows?!"
Bart,I can't keep watching this dreck.
Bart,Much better.
Bart,That is so fake. You can see the strap on the horn!
Bart,Poor Krusty. He's become the lowest form of life -- a sidekick.
Bart,"Take it easy, little buddy."
Bart,Hell no.
Bart,The Krusty Show sucks now. It's all pink and princessy. Why are great things always ruined by women? The Army... the Fantastic Four... think how awesome American Idol would be with just Simon and Randy!
Bart,What the--
Bart,Where's all your Krusty stuff?
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,Krusty?
Bart,Snap out of it! You're Krusty the clown! One of Look Magazine's hundred most-promising clowns of nineteen fifty-eight!
Bart,What are you talking about? Whose name is on that sign?
Bart,Thank God.
Bart,Huh?
Bart,That's it -- game over.
Bart,What are you talking about?
Bart,Milhouse Van Houten...will you do me the honor of ruining Krusty's wedding with me?
Bart,I don't care!
Bart,I locked him in the torah room.
Bart,"Princess, before you marry Krusty, there's someone you should meet..."
Bart,Holly Hippie. Krusty's sidekick in 1969 and his first wife.
Bart,"And his last wife, Eartha Kitt, recorded this before her untimely death."
Bart,"Can I just ask, who the hell says potato?"
Bart,"Um, knock-knock?"
Bart,I'unno.
Bart,"Not from me, you didn't."
Bart,I don't know!
Bart,"You threw it, you go find it."
Bart,Ow! There's a big box in here!
Bart,Ow!
Bart,Homer?
Bart,What are you doing?
Bart,There's money in this tree. What the hell is going on?
Bart,"Okay, let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah, legitimately, but you're too scared to do anything fun with it?"
Bart,"Look man, you've got to enjoy yourself a little. You work hard, or at least you're out of the house a lot."
Bart,And how.
Bart,Wait!
Bart,I have to go to the bathroom!
Bart,No way! I wanna go a million more times!
Bart,"Rich kids don't need school! When I grow up, you can buy an apartment building and make me the super."
Bart,"Oh yeah? If you don't keep splashing the cash, I'm gonna tell Mom that it's thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever."
Bart,"No problem. I'll just sit here, closer to Mom's ear. Mom, how do you think we really got that Panini Press?"
Bart,"Well actually, Mom--"
Bart,"Oh great, now that Dad's gonna star in it."
Bart,Mo-om...
Bart,"Homeroom, eight a.m."
Bart,Mo-om...
Bart,"Behold, Neanderthal man -- our ugliest, stupidest ancestor!"
Bart,"Come on, missing link. Put on a show."
Bart,Make a fire! Be scared of the fire! Evolve! Evolve! Get religious about a bird you see! Sprain your ankle and know it's a death sentence!
Bart,Can I get extra credit for a caveman break dance?
Bart,Homer! I need you to rickshaw me to soccer practice!
Bart,No time.
Bart,"Hey, hey, hey. Let's not get crazy. If you quit, I'm telling Mom everything."
Bart,Now how am I supposed to get to soccer practice?
Bart,"Hey Milhouse, want a turn pulling my rickshaw?"
Bart,You don't look fat.
Bart,"Exciting, exciting. I just have one question: is curling a real thing?"
Bart,Are you sure you're okay?
Bart,"Yeah, like the time you said Dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar, when he was really stuck in a barrel at the junkyard?"
Bart,"Principal Skinner?! This is bogus, man. You know the rules: two letters and a conference before I get a home visit."
Bart,"Hey Lis, wanna come with? I'm snowboarding with my new Canadian friend, Milhoose."
Bart,"Lis, what's going on? You're not normally this interesting."
Bart,What's that noise?
Bart,Your dress is covered with pins.
Bart,"Lisa, I know everything about addiction that you can learn from watching Dad. The first thing you have to do is get clean, so give me your pins. All of them."
Bart,"Eh, it's a little more like soft hate."
Bart,"I said, all of them."
Bart,And now just put your pearls back on and we'll go get some coffee.
Bart,What'll you take for the pearls?
Bart,"Really? Not even this first-ever pin from the twenty-fourteen Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia?"
Bart,"His name is ""Fatov."" He represents the Russian spirit of sloth and alcoholism."
Bart,"Hey, I like art, okay?"
Bart,Explosives? Great!
Bart,"If we put charges on the load-bearing walls, we can blow up detention hall while leaving the art room unharmed."
Bart,"Right, right. You never saw that."
Bart,"Wait, here comes the ""mykeeyah."""
Bart,"So, what are you lookin' for?"
Bart,"Hey, that's great."
Bart,We ran a subway station?
Bart,"Then they should've called it the ""Above-Ground Normal-Road."""
Bart,So that's why I'm so cool!
Bart,Homework? What homework?
Bart,Sixth-graders! Nooooooo!
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Dammit! Okay, don't panic. I can build one of those things from the crap in my desk."
Bart,Thank you. Thank you.
Bart,Good guy...
Bart,"So, can I deliver that to the office for you?"
Bart,Yes!
Bart,"Whatever happened to ""hi?"""
Bart,A letter's comin' from school and I need to be home to keep Mom and Dad from getting it.
Bart,Mommm! I have a fever!
Bart,I don't want to talk about it.
Bart,I've gotta get that letter before Mom and Dad do. Stay focused...
Bart,Focused...
Bart,Focused...
Bart,Focused...
Bart,I tried really hard to stop you from finding out. Does that help?
Bart,"Wow, how does this show stay so fresh?"
Bart,But Dad said I had to finish--
Bart,Hey Lis. Mom and Dad just told me two different things. How is that possible?
Bart,Wait a minute. Can I play them against each other so I don't have to do any homework at all?
Bart,"Hey, hey, I would end all life on this planet just to get out of doing fractions."
Bart,End. All. Life. On. This. Planet.
Bart,So much homework... childhood slipping away...
Bart,If you say so.
Bart,Let's roll.
Bart,The violence really relaxes me.
Bart,"Smooth move, Mom -- tricking Dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn't serve beer."
Bart,"Hey, at least I'm on a path."
Bart,"Dad, I know you're gonna say no, but Mom would say..."
Bart,What do you mean?
Bart,Really? Okay.
Bart,"Whoa, what is this place?"
Bart,I never knew Springfield had a subway.
Bart,It's like a Thomas The Tank Engine we can go inside!
Bart,You won't believe how I got home.
Bart,You don't even want to know if I have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late?
Bart,It's weird -- I just made an entire town lose its lunch...
Bart,...and I'm not feeling the rush.
Bart,Something's missing. Am I broken?
Bart,Really?
Bart,Wow.
Bart,"Destroy the school, eh?"
Bart,Bart needs boundaries!
Bart,"Destroy! Destroy! Boy, look at that iron work."
Bart,"Aww, you guys are the meanest parents ever. Thank you."
Bart,Totally.
Bart,"That's ridiculous. If you didn't write it, who in the world could have?"
Bart,Really? How can you be so sure?
Bart,"Thanks, Lis."
Bart,"Dad, no! That takes us into a construction site!"
Bart,"Thanks for the ride! / Bye, Dad!"
Bart,Where's Mrs. K.?
Bart,"So, who's gonna take her place? Me, I hope?"
Bart,The other fourth grade?! But they're so different from us. They have music on Tuesdays!
Bart,They look like this!
Bart,"Um, this is the last seat, so..."
Bart,"Hi, Nikki. I'm Bart. This situation, it's nuts, right?"
Bart,"Oh look at you, opening a book so you won't have to talk to me. Well I'm just gonna be tuning up the old armpit."
Bart,"Whoa. Damn, this caterpillar can eat! Damn! DAMN!!!"
Bart,"Oh man, you girls ruin everything -- even vampires."
Bart,"No, they're all about chomping neck. And they don't put product in their hair like this loser."
Bart,Can I draw a robot barfing screws on your arm with my Sharpie?
Bart,"Annnnd, finished."
Bart,"Dad, I know we don't normally talk about this stuff, but there's this girl at school I kind of like."
Bart,"Anyway, I'm really hoping you could... Dad?"
Bart,"Dad, that is genius, but I need some advice--"
Bart,But I need to talk about man stuff!
Bart,He did?
Bart,So I kinda like this girl at school but I'm not sure if she likes me back.
Bart,Really? Did that ever work for you?
Bart,"Whoa, she boards, too?"
Bart,It's not my fault -- Grampa told me to kiss her!
Bart,"If I talk to Nikki, I'm sure I can--"
Bart,That's no problem -- Mom can make garbage taste great.
Bart,"Well, I mean it."
Bart,This is awesome! If only real life was in 3-D.
Bart,"Oh, look at their guts."
Bart,"Hey Willie, does he taste like failure?"
Bart,Maybe I did do something wrong.
Bart,Huh?
Bart,What the hell are you doing?
Bart,You are the biggest psycho I ever met.
Bart,Absolutely not.
Bart,"Yeah, till they find out about us."
Bart,"Well, like, uh, aren't you my girlfriend now?"
Bart,I'm sorry.
Bart,Just tell me what you want!
Bart,I want you to act the same way two days in a row! Augggh! I am not gonna let you hurt me anymore.
Bart,Nikki! Thanks for saving my life.
Bart,"I don't get you! You're hot, you're cold... What is your deal?!"
Bart,I give up! Smell ya later.
Bart,I love youuuuuu!
Bart,Great -- more hell for me!
Bart,Krav ma-wha?
Bart,"Yeah, thanks a lot, Flanders."
Bart,Sad.
Bart,Sad.
Bart,Never gonna happen.
Bart,"Sad. Maybe, if you were Brad Pitt."
Bart,"Reading prayers and ignoring them, just like God."
Bart,"Hey, this one's from you."
Bart,"""Dear Lord, don't let Marge find out the hotel leaves chocolates on the pillows at night."""
Bart,"Hey, why am I running from a girl?"
Bart,Call me when you're old enough for your bat mitzvah. I'll bring you an envelope full of nothin'.
Bart,Ka-ra-té!
Bart,You don't fight like a girl! Or even a Milhouse!
Bart,"Ay carumba. Hey, is that the Ark of the Covenant?"
Bart,Ka-ra-té!
Bart,Quit going for my groin!
Bart,I already do that.
Bart,Have you ever noticed that Dad always gets the disease they write about in the in-flight magazine?
Bart,I want the window seat.
Bart,You can't hurt what's already dead.
Bart,I guess you can.
Bart,Mom! I'm gonna go hurl rotten fruit!
Bart,Where are you going?
Bart,I hate being stuck at home!
Bart,"Mom, you don't play with Lisa. You play despite her."
Bart,"Bart, I'm not thrilled either. But one day we might need each other for organ transplants, so we'd better keep the lines of communication open. Want to help me with my ant farm?"
Bart,You plant the ants and then they grow?
Bart,Really? What are they growing?
Bart,No!
Bart,"Don't worry. I gave 'em a Pop Tart. The healthy kind, strawberry-frosted."
Bart,"Oh Lisa, you take the fun out of everything! I am so glad I am not your kid."
Bart,"You should be. If I was in your tummy, I'd poo in your throat."
Bart,Oh no. You are not taking the children.
Bart,I will never forgive you.
Bart,Aw...
Bart,I know.
Bart,Can I come in?
Bart,Annie?
Bart,It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill our ants.
Bart,"Dad, before you jump to conclusions..."
Bart,"Who's carrying fifty times her weight? Ooo, you are!"
Bart,"Oh my God, that is so sad."
Bart,"Do we let her spend the rest of her life in the wild? Or let her die in captivity, like Grampa?"
Bart,"Goodbye, Annie, my eight-legged friend."
Bart,"Oh, thank God. I thought I broke two off."
Bart,I can't believe you're making us go to a birthday party for a kid we don't even know.
Bart,I don't even remember if Dylan's a boy or a girl.
Bart,Carrot cake?!
Bart,"Hey, dinks. Whatcha dweebin'?"
Bart,What?! Impossible!
Bart,How'd a Pull-Up like you get a great card like that?
Bart,"Ralph, I will play you for that card."
Bart,Deal.
Bart,This product is unbelievable!
Bart,Awesome. You finally made my room cool!
Bart,What? No! Not until you raise my allowance.
Bart,Getting higher and higher...
Bart,...Scores on Battle Ball!
Bart,It's no fun if my Mom likes them!
Bart,"Come on, toilet! If you can handle Dad, you can handle this!"
Bart,When is my turn over?
Bart,"Dear Lord, you've got the wind I need, I've got the prayers you crave. Let's make a deal."
Bart,Look at the cool stuff that washed up!
Bart,Scuba goggles!
Bart,Medical waste!
Bart,Huh? / Whoa.
Bart,I'm gonna have my next birthday party on this thing.
Bart,Ay carumba.
Bart,Check it out! World's biggest armpit fart!
Bart,You just made a powerful enemy!
Bart,"Wake up, Lis!"
Bart,They're doing it!
Bart,Not perfect?! You can say that again.
Bart,"Milhouse, this'll be the biggest dead animal we ever poked with a stick!"
Bart,No. I won't.
Bart,Responsibly.
Bart,"He sure nailed you, Lis."
Bart,"Blonde guys aren't dumb. They're evil. Like in ""The Karate Kid"" and World War Two."
Bart,"So you like to watch, huh?! Well, take a look at this!"
Bart,"Whoa, a blind spot!"
Bart,Experimenting with my butt.
Bart,"Welcome to Chaos Corners, the Pleasure Patch, Satan's Triangle...the one place in town no cameras can see you and no laws can touch you!"
Bart,"Hey Homer, what do you think Mom meant by ""taking care of something?"""
Bart,You rebel scum make me sick! This is sweet justice for how you greybacks treated our boys at Andersonville!
Bart,Hyaa! Hyaa!
Bart,"I need some cash, man."
Bart,You will lose all your money. We'll see about that!
Bart,"One, please."
Bart,What scar?
Bart,Cookies!
Bart,Oh come on. What kind of big fat moron would fall for...
Bart,"Dames. Well, I'm gonna go introduce myself Bart Simpson style."
Bart,Yo. Bart Simpson. No doubt you read about me in your nuisance neighbor disclosure.
Bart,Huh? Say that again.
Bart,Sideshow Bob!
Bart,"I know he doesn't look like him, but I'll never forget that voice!"
Bart,"Look, I'm telling you, no matter who he says he is, he's really Sideshow Bob!"
Bart,Really? Hm. Maybe I...
Bart,Sideshow Bob!
Bart,I'll prove I'm not crazy. Sideshow Bob could never resist singing along to a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.
Bart,Yum Yum. I'm Peep-bo.
Bart,"And a one, and a two, and a..."
Bart,We need a third maid. Maybe someone will step in and help.
Bart,TWO LITTLE MAIDS IN ATTENDANCE COME.
Bart,THREE LITTLE MAIDS... THREE LITTLE MAIDS...
Bart,THREE... LIT-TLE MAIDS...
Bart,Shut up.
Bart,"All right, ""Walt Warren,"" let's see who you really are."
Bart,"""Harmless World,"" ""Mild Manners,"" ""Not Mad Magazine,"" ""Nap Fancy,"" ""Calm,"" ""Comfortable,"" a ""Cuddly Puppies"" calendar..."
Bart,"Aww, the little guy can't get out of the pumpkin. There must be something here!"
Bart,"Something, something, something!"
Bart,Walt is Sideshow Bob and I'm gonna prove it. Look!
Bart,Who needs a knife this big?
Bart,"Boner. Mom, I'm scared!"
Bart,I can't see!
Bart,That is Bob. Guess I was wrong.
Bart,Great day to be alive!
Bart,The Cascades?! They totally stole the Federal Cup from us last year! Can I go Mom? Can I?
Bart,No.
Bart,"Uh, you missed the turn-off, Mr. Warren."
Bart,/
Bart,You could just rent it till the market recovers... which'll be never!
Bart,"Come on, Bob, you don't need to kill me. I'll probably kill myself pretty soon with all the stupid things I do. Oh no, I swallowed my tongue."
Bart,"You know, the great ones can kill without explaining."
Bart,I haven't gotten to that part yet!
Bart,I'm a slow reader!
Bart,Are you here to teach me or to kill me?
Bart,"Ruining your plan -- if you shoot me while we're in the same state, you go to jail."
Bart,"See, Bob. Even you hate to see you."
Bart,"Well, not everything -- apparently someone switched your face with a butt."
Bart,"Hang on, here's a spot that still looks good."
Bart,"So, do we have a winner?"
Bart,I think I've come up with the answer.
Bart,Just call me Barf Simpson.
Bart,"Dad, do you realize we've put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined?"
Bart,For what?
Bart,"And now, owned by one of the ugliest families in Springfield... ""Satan's Little Helper""!"
Bart,"Huh? Wait a minute, this doesn't look like Oslo. Where are the wood-stave churches? Historic Akershus Fortress?"
Bart,We gotta find a clip that proves Krusty's made a cultural contribution.
Bart,"Let's see what we've got here. Krusty drunk on ""The Tonight Show,"" Krusty drunk on ""The Today Show,"" Krusty confesses to self-mutilation on Match Game P.M., ""Krusty Trips The Pope,"" ""Krusty Vomits In Baby Carriage"", ""Krusty Uses Child As Shield"", ""Krusty Celebrity Poker Freak-Out"", ""Krusty Super Bowl Nip Slip"" Ah, here we are, ""Krusty On ""The Electric Company."""
Bart,And it's on this DVD!
Bart,"Three days later, South Africa freed Nelson Mandela from prison."
Bart,I thought we were going to breakfast.
Bart,"Yeah, so we've already heard stories from thousands of years ago, about stuff that didn't happen."
Bart,This won't even cover the vig on what I owe!
Bart,I just paid some loser fifty bucks to walk up the down escalator all day.
Bart,Dummyball.
Bart,Maybe she's one of those sexy school- supply company reps.
Bart,What? Why?
Bart,"But without a coach, we can't play!"
Bart,Can't play baseball... what am I gonna do?
Bart,How'd you like to kiss my ass?
Bart,Huh?
Bart,What's goin' on?
Bart,Awesome! Who is it?
Bart,Lisa?!
Bart,"No, we can't stand the idea of someone who knows nothing about baseball coaching a baseball team."
Bart,We're not losers. Last year we finished six and five.
Bart,"Fine, you can be our coach."
Bart,Wrong sport.
Bart,Also wrong.
Bart,"A little's not gonna be enough, honey pie."
Bart,"You got it, tootsie pop."
Bart,"My stupid sister's taken the fun out of baseball. What happened to stealing bases, the suicide squeeze, throwin' a little chin music?"
Bart,"This isn't the game I grew up with, the game played in the misty ballparks of Enron Field, or Pac Bell, then S.B.C., now A. T. and T. Park. And from now on, I'm gonna play my game."
Bart,But I'm on a hot streak.
Bart,I wish you were a statistical illusion.
Bart,So what? We won.
Bart,"Here's my uniform, since I won't be needing it any more!"
Bart,"You know, Lis, I'm glad I'm not playing baseball anymore. I think I'm more interested in soccer!"
Bart,"No, no, no, no. I got a lot goin' on."
Bart,"Well, let's go to the bleachers. I brought an air horn and a megaphone."
Bart,Testing...
Bart,Are you taking me to the dentist?
Bart,"Y'know Mom, after only seven hours in this amusement park, I'm finally enjoying myself. I'm actually starting to forget about..."
Bart,Hey Lis.
Bart,"Sorry sis, I've moved on, and my days of listening to my manager are over."
Bart,Did someone order a happy ending?
Bart,I'm stealing home!
Bart,Did I make it?
Bart,I guess your computer was right.
Bart,"And according to my gut, you're okay too."
Bart,Milhouse! Do we have enough points for a weapons upgrade?
Bart,Nothing beats a weapon made of weapons!
Bart,It's a game. We're not hurtin' anybody.
Bart,"So which of these ""bored lames"" shall we play? Taffyland?"
Bart,Consternation?
Bart,Mousecatch?
Bart,Funopoly?
Bart,Yahtzu?
Bart,"Hey, I've never seen this one before."
Bart,"Hey, it's gotta be good if Satan put his name on it."
Bart,"Here, I'll be the demon, you be the thimble."
Bart,One...
Bart,...two.
Bart,How do we make this stop?
Bart,Set a course for B-7.
Bart,"I wish I could see my Mom one last time so I can say ""this is all your fault""!"
Bart,"C'mon, man, climb up!"
Bart,That blank can be any letter we want!
Bart,"The final challenge! Mousecatch... a game so lame, no one's ever finished it!"
Bart,Crazy eights!
Bart,"Think Bart, think! What was that lesson I learned from videogames? Oh yeah, kill, kill, kill!"
Bart,There comes a time to beat the crap out of childish things!
Bart,This stupid thing never works.
Bart,That's it. From now on we'll just play hangman.
Bart,"Wait, wait! We still get one more letter!"
Bart,That's not a letter!
Bart,"Hey, what's that weird look on all those girls' faces?"
Bart,"Oh I've seen it, especially when I do this."
Bart,Where the hell are we? I've never seen stores like these before.
Bart,"Well, stop in and say ""hi"" to me 'cause I'll still be there -- chillin' in my basement bachelor pad."
Bart,As long as I can dig you up and stick you on the front porch every Halloween.
Bart,We'll see.
Bart,I wanna go read books in the car.
Bart,I just wanna sit in the car!
Bart,Comin' through!
Bart,Just when you think I'm out of ideas!
Bart,"I'm just whistlin', man."
Bart,We're both in the same reading group. I think you know how smart I am.
Bart,I'm not a bully! It's just a series of incredible coincidences!
Bart,School bus!
Bart,Normal. You?
Bart,You're just imagining things.
Bart,Hm.
Bart,What does your note say?
Bart,You mean an egg?
Bart,Ha! You're not so tough now.
Bart,I don't wanna talk about it.
Bart,A kid at school's gonna beat me up.
Bart,Milhouse couldn't beat me up.
Bart,It's not Milhouse!
Bart,It's Nelson!
Bart,How do I do that?
Bart,It's not Milhouse!
Bart,"Uh, Nelson... for someone who never goes to the dentist, you have pretty good teeth."
Bart,Uh... you do a lot with a limited wardrobe!
Bart,"Uh, uh, you punch really good!"
Bart,Oh yeah! And-and you always avoid the face around picture day. People appreciate that.
Bart,"You really care, man. A lot of bullies just phone it in. Kearney."
Bart,"Mom, thanks to you, this box sucker didn't beat me up!"
Bart,"Anthill, wasp nest, moose poop, Mr. Burns... Mr. Burns?"
Bart,My poop stick has brought him back to life! But which end?
Bart,What do you want?
Bart,"C'mon, man, leave me alone."
Bart,Whoa! Your brains have turned to oatmeal!
Bart,"This is too weird, man."
Bart,What am I gonna do with you?
Bart,"Look, I know you're cool now, but my Dad hates you more than celery, and my Mom said no new pets -- so I'm hiding you in my room."
Bart,I'm playing with my Sergeant Activity Doll.
Bart,"Okay, okay. I'll find you some food."
Bart,Come back! I'm not finished giving you your bath!
Bart,"This town can't teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge."
Bart,"Dad, you're gonna wreck him for everybody!"
Bart,I bet it's a combination to a safe!
Bart,"Ask about the safe. No, better yet, act like you know about the safe."
Bart,"Me? Just what in my long, sad history with frogs makes you think I can take care of a bird?"
Bart,He's crawling on your arm.
Bart,"Okay, Ray, your wing is healed. Go on. Live your life."
Bart,"Aw, c'mon, man. Admit it -- you knew this day would come."
Bart,You and I have shared too many seed bells to just walk away from this.
Bart,"Go ahead, make fun of me. I lost my heart to a bird."
Bart,"Man, you were not into that. What's wrong?"
Bart,That coop looks a little flimsy.
Bart,"Now that you're officially my bird, let me fill you in on the pecking order around here."
Bart,"The top dog is me, followed by the top dog, the dog... ...then the cat... then you... but don't feel bad, you're ahead of Milhouse."
Bart,"Sorry man, it's still too soon."
Bart,"Wow, Ray, you have hidden talents!"
Bart,"No, I was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth."
Bart,As long as it means we're not learning.
Bart,What about the Detroit Lions?
Bart,"Hear that, boy? You're gonna be a racing pigeon!"
Bart,It's getting a little chilly -- I'd better put a blanket on Ray.
Bart,Dad! Help!
Bart,Nooooo!
Bart,Thanks. That song does make me feel a little better.
Bart,You really don't get it.
Bart,I hope you learned something here.
Bart,"Well, he shouldn't kill birds. It's not right!"
Bart,I guess.
Bart,"See? He's a questionable character! He used to hang around racetracks, you know!"
Bart,"Why is it coming with us? And for once, I'm not talkin' about Lisa."
Bart,What about all the other pets you told us went to a farm upstate?
Bart,"Well, boy, I guess this is it. We've shared a lot of great memories, like the time we got our picture in the paper with the caption ""Who's Walking Who?"""
Bart,"But it's not my fault you're leaving, it's yours. Because you should never, ever kill a bird. Ever!"
Bart,I'd like a moment to ourselves.
Bart,Help! Kill the bird!
Bart,Why you little...
Bart,"Well, boy, I guess I owe you an apology. Who's a bird-eating monster? You are. You are! Yes you are!"
Bart,"Hey, I need those cookies for Santa."
Bart,"Yep. Come midnight, I'll be sittin' here with cold cookies, warm milk, and hot lead."
Bart,"For the last three years, I've asked that rosy-cheeked nog-hog for a dirt bike. And all he brought me was a zillion lame-o toys that I immediately broke and threw in this bag."
Bart,I wanted them till I got them! But this year I'm gettin' my dirt bike.
Bart,"Great, Mom. Now I lost track of my pump count. One pump, two pump..."
Bart,"Bowl full of jelly, pump lead in his belly..."
Bart,Wha?
Bart,"Some ""express."""
Bart,We're flying!
Bart,"Excuse me, Mister Goblin?"
Bart,"Whatever you say. Um, look, how do I get to Santa?"
Bart,Isn't this the busy season? Where is everybody?
Bart,"Well, who needs wrapping paper anyway? Just stick a bow on the toy and you're ready to go."
Bart,"Bow, bow, bow, bow, bing, bang, boom!"
Bart,Just point me to Santa.
Bart,You're outta your elfin mind!
Bart,Okay. You got me. But I'm gettin' my dirt bike -- and you can't stop me.
Bart,"No disrespect, fat man, but you'd better poop out a dirt bike."
Bart,"Listen here, Kringle. I may have been naughty this year. But by today's standards, naughty's nothing. I didn't get anybody pregnant, I didn't Facebook a kid to death... make with my dirt bike!"
Bart,"Oh c'mon, man. Things aren't that bad."
Bart,You win.
Bart,You don't have to do that. I have socks. I'll give you socks!
Bart,Yours.
Bart,Huh? I thought you said you didn't want a tree.
Bart,...WIE TREU SIND DEINE BLÄTTER!
Bart,"Me and Milhouse had a snowball fight, then an ice-ball fight, then a fight-fight!"
Bart,I can't think of a better way to spend Jesus' birthday.
Bart,We brought you breakfast in bed!
Bart,"Oh man, not the lame-o ""Twelve Days of Christmas."""
Bart,We did that one already!
Bart,I don't even want to smell sparkling apple juice again.
Bart,Pig in a blanket!
Bart,Aunt Selma's leg!
Bart,Let's just take it easy.
Bart,We all made mistakes on New Year's Eve.
Bart,There is only one upside to today.
Bart,That's not for five hours!
Bart,"We're Simpsons, Dad. We don't do good behavior."
Bart,Keep him safe from shanks and shivs. Let him become rich in the jailyard currencies of cigarettes and dried fish...
Bart,How about... in your dreams!
Bart,That's it! We challenge you to a rumble.
Bart,Rumble it is. After school. Rain or shine.
Bart,Anybody wanna wait for shine?
Bart,"It's agreed -- no biting, no throwing rocks, no face farts, flying face farts, backdoor haircuts, 'nad noogies, moist Michaels, and absolutely no ""Brazilian hardwood."""
Bart,"Okay, you want hardwood?"
Bart,Then let's do this thing!
Bart,Where'd you get that scar?
Bart,When did this happen?
Bart,You sure none of you guys gave me this?
Bart,"Mom, do you have any idea how I got this scar?"
Bart,"Ew, you're sitting on the toilet."
Bart,"Ah, such an innocent time. Before cooties ravaged our community. How come we don't get together anymore?"
Bart,"Whoa. You don't look like a mom, you look happy."
Bart,There's nothing cooler than calling yourself cool.
Bart,Awesome! I'll get the white wine.
Bart,Why not? Are you having red meat?
Bart,Wow! We all have the same scar!
Bart,Cowabungaaa--
Bart,Those dudes were... intense.
Bart,"Great, great."
Bart,"Listen, any of you guys wanna play Old Maid?"
Bart,"If I do it, you're supposed to stop!"
Bart,"You're not the chicken, I'm the chicken!"
Bart,Hey.
Bart,They dared me to see how many TV remotes I could stick in my mouth.
Bart,Something drove them apart once before...
Bart,And I bet it has something to do with this scar.
Bart,Comic Book Guy! Thanks.
Bart,"All right, Comic Book Guy, tell me my origin story."
Bart,"You leave me no choice. I hold in my hands a mint-condition copy of the legendary ""Interesting Stories Number Twenty-Seven."""
Bart,And if you don't tell us what we want to know...
Bart,Are you willing to take that chance?
Bart,"Look pal, we've gotta speed this up."
Bart,"I go to see those other guys, we blow this junk up, once again Mom decides that they're a bad influence on me, and she stops seeing those women who make her so happy."
Bart,"Mom, I'll admit it: I wanted to create a devastating explosion to get back my Mom."
Bart,I made you a coffee mug on Mother's Day! Isn't that enough?
Bart,"I could light these, but, it wouldn't be the same."
Bart,"Maybe Lisa and I can be friends -- not with each other, but with you."
Bart,"What am I doin' here, Seymour? The thing I'm planning hasn't even gone off yet."
Bart,That wasn't me and you're my alibi.
Bart,"Oh yeah, her. Classic space case."
Bart,"I see how it is. You get a booty call and I get a cootie call. Well, it's gonna cost ya."
Bart,Triple spring break plus four weeks at Christmas.
Bart,"Okay, have fun dying alone."
Bart,"Great, baby. Get me some more tokens."
Bart,"Come on, come to life! I swear I'll be cool about it."
Bart,Sure.
Bart,"Melody, you're a great girl, but... I see you as more of a sister... and I don't like my sister."
Bart,What happened?
Bart,And?
Bart,You've been gone for three months!
Bart,Stupid cheap bike! To think I was gonna put fenders on you.
Bart,Oh. My. God.
Bart,I think I just met the thing I'm gonna die on.
Bart,I gotta have that mini-bike!
Bart,Those are girl overalls.
Bart,"Can I have it, Dad? Can I?"
Bart,What is this crap? Are you wearing a wire?
Bart,Are you kidding? You're the worst dad who ever lived! I'd rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you!
Bart,How 'bout this? I let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile.
Bart,"Lis, I've gotta talk to you."
Bart,Don't you minimize me!
Bart,How can I earn money to buy the world's most awesome thing?
Bart,Kids don't deliver newspapers anymore. It's just creeps in trucks.
Bart,Does he give you money for getting good grades?
Bart,"Dad, if I get an ""A"" on my math test, would that be worth some money?"
Bart,There's no way that means anything other than I get a mini-bike. To the library!
Bart,"It's me, Willie. Bart Simpson."
Bart,"I did it! I got an ""A""!"
Bart,"Uh, Dad. If we could get to the reward...?"
Bart,What the? I wanted a mini-bike! I told all my friends I was getting one!
Bart,Yes they were! But now they won't be! Because I don't have a mini-bike!
Bart,Stupid jerk. He owes me a mini-bike and I am going to get it.
Bart,"...so I'm offering to trade your country nuclear secrets for a mini-bike. Concludingly yours, Bart Simpson."
Bart,A gutter cleaning coupon?
Bart,You must've found out about my letters. They were just a joke.
Bart,I don't know... can I really betray my country? I say the pledge of allegiance every day.
Bart,"Dad, I was thinking about it and... you're right. You shouldn't buy me something I didn't earn. And because you gave me the tough love I didn't know I needed, I'm gonna be spending lots and lots more time with you."
Bart,"I love visiting you at work, Dad."
Bart,"They will be if you're in 'em, pops."
Bart,"Aw, and they gave me my own vanity plate."
Bart,You're gonna love meeting my friends.
Bart,Where the hell did that come from?
Bart,No! Why in the world would you get me this?
Bart,Oh. That's great. I wouldn't trade it for all the tea in China?!
Bart,It's still here! Yes! I get the flash drive back and the manila envelope.
Bart,"Masters, I can explain."
Bart,A teddy bear?
Bart,Dad!
Bart,"You know, Dad, I really did have a good time hanging out with you."
Bart,I don't want to talk about my Mom's hair.
Bart,"I just have one question about hair. Where does mine start? Head, head, head, hair... where's the border?"
Bart,What are we?!
Bart,Take that back!
Bart,Take that back!
Bart,I... I don't want to talk about it.
Bart,Can we close the door?
Bart,I don't think I want to.
Bart,Well...
Bart,"All right, I know there's a camera in you somewhere."
Bart,"Hey Dad, did you color your hair too?"
Bart,"So, the family's still gone. What do I do now?"
Bart,"Whoa, mama!"
Bart,Let me freshen that up for ya.
Bart,I love Saturdays!
Bart,I'm bored.
Bart,"That's ""Angry Dad""! The semi-autobiographical web cartoon I created!"
Bart,My stupid cartoon a movie? Thank you!
Bart,"Thanks for letting me make this movie, Mr. Millwood! I've always loved cartoons, going way back to the real early SpongeBobs."
Bart,"Oh, man. What can we do?"
Bart,Hey Homer! You want to be the voice of Angry Dad?
Bart,Thanks for coming out -- one announcement: the voice of Angry Dad will be on a speakerphone today.
Bart,"Hi, everyone. I'm Bart Simpson, the creator of ""Angry Dad."" To make this film, I had to miss countless hours of school, and there was also some hardship. I hope you like it as much as I do."
Bart,What did they think?
Bart,A short film?
Bart,Name one more.
Bart,"I don't know who that is, but I'm convinced. Let's start cutting."
Bart,I am the Bart.
Bart,"This is insane! He didn't show up for work, he bad-mouthed the movie on Jimmy Fallon, and now he's hoggin' all the credit!"
Bart,My category comes up pretty soon. I'm home free as long as this Oscar show is tight and fast-paced.
Bart,'Old on -- I'm 'earing my 'etainer.
Bart,Angry Dad got an Oscar nomination?!
Bart,I'M GOING TO THE OS-CARS! NOT AS A SEAT FILL-ER! I'LL GET A GIFT BAS-KET! BUT I WON'T DE-CLARE IT!
Bart,Uh... nobody. Wrong number.
Bart,"My lame-o sister, Lisa."
Bart,"Homer? Well, I don't know. L.A.'s a world-class city with a lot to offer. He's probably enjoying the sights..."
Bart,"Conductor, get ready to play my song!"
Bart,Yes!
Bart,This is it... I finally get to accept an award for my movie...except it's not just my movie. It was my sister's idea to make this into a short. And so many animators... every day was somebody's birthday. And you know what? It was my Dad's movie too. I only wish he were here and not at Cerritos Auto Square.
Bart,"This whole thing is silly. I mean, isn't the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard?"
Bart,"We can still order a replacement from the academy, right?"
Bart,Oh my God! The legends are true!
Bart,Better -- the prospectors left naughty French postcards!
Bart,"Whoa, mama."
Bart,Either the grave or somewhere much worse.
Bart,Fine. How's it goin'?
Bart,Trying to get out of here before Grampa wakes up.
Bart,"Mom, quick! Our lunches!"
Bart,To the antique store!
Bart,Cool! Are they robots?
Bart,"No, no. You're Augustus Gloop, the fat German boy!"
Bart,"Hm, wrong hands, eh? That's your cue, boys."
Bart,I've got something you can stuff in that old bag.
Bart,I've got some stuff to put a smile on that corpse.
Bart,Don't player hate. I'm just a businessboy.
Bart,"No, it's cool -- it's like we've got our own monster!"
Bart,"Well, actually... I may have accidentally traded a few of those pills, for money..."
Bart,"...which I may have already spent, ironically, on these novelty eyeglasses."
Bart,Who the hell are Cheech and Chong?
Bart,Who are Beavis and Butthead?
Bart,We don't have any dope.
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"I met the new principal, Mr. Baumgartner. He seemed really cool. When he walked through the gym, he shot a basket!"
Bart,"How now, mad spirits, before we part / 'Tis I, mischievous and puckish Bart / 'Twas not I the players did disturb / 'Twas the doings of a green and naughty herb / The gods have righted every wrong / Cheech the stoner has his Chong!"
Bart,"And Homer, he is back with Mom / you can watch this tomorrow at Hulu.com."
Bart,Eh. This song's a little bossy for me.
Bart,Stop it!
Bart,Cut it out!
Bart,What does that mean?!
Bart,"Quit it! Knock it off! Stop it! Dad, this isn't funny!"
Bart,"Dad, how could you do that? The whole audience saw me pee my pants!"
Bart,Why did I agree to moderate this teleconference?
Bart,Homer.
Bart,Good for you. No more drinkin'?
Bart,"I just got up, man."
Bart,Fine.
Bart,"Okay, first I'll send down my shoes."
Bart,"He'd say ""I'm a grown man who's scared of my own son."""
Bart,Oh yeah? Look.
Bart,Fill the board then wash my car.
Bart,What was that?
Bart,You think you're better than the Great Simpsini?!
Bart,Well you're not!
Bart,"What're you gonna do, write a book about me?"
Bart,You couldn't get in the door of Random House if your name was Bennett Cerf the Third!
Bart,"One, two, three, cry! One, two, three, cry!"
Bart,"How's that water, wet like your tears?"
Bart,"Precious, is that you?"
Bart,"Yes, Mama."
Bart,You think you're so pretty? Where's my Lotto ticket?!
Bart,"I forgot, Mama."
Bart,And don't you come back without it! You hear me?! Hurry up!
Bart,I don't see many more movie roles for a girl like you! Not unless George Lucas needs another death star!
Bart,"No! Stop! No ""Star Wars"" parodies!"
Bart,"Okay, go straight..."
Bart,Three steps right...
Bart,Two to the left.
Bart,Sure do. I'm just bad at counting. Two to the right...
Bart,Backwards one...
Bart,Diagonal two...
Bart,Now do-se-do...
Bart,Can't look. Texting.
Bart,I feel something for him. Here it comes.
Bart,"Thanks, Dad."
Bart,"Y'know, I was skeptical, but I guess therapy works."
Bart,Oh man. I can't believe we have to pick the peaches ourselves. This activity is so lame I'm gonna daydream about school.
Bart,"Dammit, a pop quiz!"
Bart,How many verses does this song have?
Bart,"I forget what phase two is, but I'll assume we just dump the peaches like we discussed."
Bart,"I'll assume that means ""yes."""
Bart,"The name's ""Bart."""
Bart,What idiot put the dump so far away from where people live?
Bart,"Gentlemen, I think I have the solution to your problem."
Bart,Lisa can't be a magician -- that's my thing! I'm the one that got a magic set for Christmas two years ago.
Bart,Kid scissors. Lame.
Bart,Aye ca-rum-ba.
Bart,She has no friends.
Bart,Tell me if she falls.
Bart,"Hey Dad, there's an arcade across the street... and there's really no point in all of us waiting in line..."
Bart,I was invited to that party!
Bart,All that's left is banana Runts! That's the worst Runt!
Bart,"Back of the line, stranger!"
Bart,Next in line! What am I bid for next in line?!
Bart,My lick.
Bart,Hey -- you licked the back! That was my side!
Bart,Sister spit!
Bart,You're a truffle.
Bart,Only you can make tree poop boring.
Bart,You're lookin' at him.
Bart,More than I can count.
Bart,Just think of what we can do with that moolah.
Bart,"That's a lot of zeros! You know, all this truffle hunting has made me a little thirsty. Can we go home now?"
Bart,How big?
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Oh, man!"
Bart,All I smell here is desperation.
Bart,"If you think that makes me a better musher, you're wrong. Wait a second..."
Bart,This is our house. There's nothing buried here but hopes and dreams!
Bart,The truffle's right over here!
Bart,Truffle's in your room? I thought you'd been selling them!
Bart,Bart... I haven't been selling the truffles. I've been eating them.
Bart,Really? Why?
Bart,"Vegetarian food is so boring! Pasta, soy... you know what's a bad pizza topping? Broccoli!"
Bart,But I worked so hard! I've got dirt under my fingernails I'll never get out. Not that I'm gonna try.
Bart,Or give it to someone who deserves it.
Bart,"You spent your life searching for these, but you never had one."
Bart,"Well, this is yours."
Bart,I jumped in front of your picture! Now it's ruined!
Bart,I'm really sorry it wasn't a year.
Bart,I already do! It's too close to Christmas!
Bart,Not to worry.
Bart,Now what?
Bart,"Milhouse, check it out! I put a roadblock on the curly slide!"
Bart,Isn't this the greatest day ever?!
Bart,"There are no more great days, Bart. Just days."
Bart,"What's wrong, man?"
Bart,"Hey Lis, those books aren't gonna pick themselves up."
Bart,This dame is really into you!
Bart,"I dunno. It's one of those mysteries, like how do my clothes get clean and put back in my drawers?"
Bart,"Hey, that's Taffy's page. Ooh, I see that she's in a relationship."
Bart,I hear he goes to California on his vacations.
Bart,"Once you get past the sister ick, they're fine."
Bart,"Dad, the cake!"
Bart,With the keys!
Bart,That's the key to my box with the real skull.
Bart,Are you nuts?! Let's have some fun!
Bart,Time to get my mischief on!
Bart,Let's start with a little federal crime.
Bart,What the? I tried to do bad and I did good!
Bart,"Maybe this key will be the key to putting the ""key"" in anarchy."
Bart,The last place anybody would expect to see a moon: the sky!
Bart,"Aw jeez, I hope no one heard you say that."
Bart,I'm so sick of keys. They've brought nothing but good luck since I got them.
Bart,"Crazy classroom, bus full of missing kids... I know who'd have some answers. Someone who's been here a long, long time."
Bart,But it's summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing.
Bart,What videogame is this like?
Bart,For Wii or Xbox?
Bart,Original or Three-Sixty?
Bart,Yes! And I've got gum on my shoe!
Bart,"There's nothing I can do to save my sister, the blimp or this airship."
Bart,Looking for something?
Bart,Does it look like... this?
Bart,No one cancels my free play!
Bart,"Sorry, man."
Bart,Whee!
Bart,Psst! Mrs. K!
Bart,Down here!
Bart,You shouldn't suffer for my bad deed. It should just go unpunished forever.
Bart,Meet me in the bathroom.
Bart,Check this out: a dead possum.
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,"Mrs. K., I'm here to spring you."
Bart,You didn't do that.
Bart,Who says you're leaving?
Bart,"Mm, I use it to workshop my pranks."
Bart,Now follow me!
Bart,I can't believe a middle-aged woman is scared of a three-story drop.
Bart,"See ya tomorrow, Teach."
Bart,Mrs. K.? Are you still bumping moustaches with Ned?
Bart,Even on snow days?
Bart,But... what if my dog eats it?
Bart,Yeah... um... he hates how learning has taken me to a place he'll never go. See?
Bart,Hang on. Wait a minute.
Bart,"See, Dad? Having Krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. Teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. We're natural enemies, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln."
Bart,"If fairy tales have taught us one thing, it's that first wives are perfect, second wives are horrible."
Bart,And Cinderella's stepmom made her sew clothes and mop the floor.
Bart,"No, I..."
Bart,"Wait, this tastes different."
Bart,Gross!
Bart,You tricked us!
Bart,"So Wayne, how'd you learn all those cool self-defense moves?"
Bart,I admit it! I let Milhouse lie down in your bed!
Bart,Remember everything they say and tell us later in rattle code.
Bart,"What do you mean ""no?"""
Bart,If I told you I'd have to kill you. Can I tell ya?
Bart,For this masterpiece I bid...one thousand dollars!
Bart,"'Allo, luvs!"
Bart,I'm Mrs. Knickertwist! And I've had a proper hardy-har at your expense!
Bart,...stacks of resumes in back seat...
Bart,"Same garbage, different dumpster."
Bart,"Dollar bill guy, five dollar bill guy, sex guy, Will Ferrell, black guy."
Bart,"I'd act like I'm interested, but inside I'd be bored."
Bart,"Hey, this Roosevelt guy was sorta interesting. Did you know he was a colonel in the army?"
Bart,"And one time, during a speech, he was shot by a saloon-keeper -- but Teddy finished his speech before heading to the hospital!!"
Bart,"I've never said this before, but I'd like to learn more!"
Bart,"Man, Teddy Roosevelt killed more Spaniards in one day than most people do in their whole lives!"
Bart,"Really? I wanted to learn more about trust busting. Take that, Standard Oil!"
Bart,"Well, I've learned a lot today. Now to go home and let TV slowly rot it all away."
Bart,I thought teachers only went outdoors to smoke and cry.
Bart,No sir.
Bart,"Well, when horses poop, they don't stop. They just keep walking."
Bart,Wow. And here I thought God created all this. Thanks for setting me straight.
Bart,You've filled my head with horse poop and atheism! And all these years I thought I was unteachable.
Bart,A man who is good enough to shed his blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.
Bart,"Just quoting our twenty-sixth president, Lis. You could use a little T.R. in your life."
Bart,Balderdash! Teddy Roosevelt protected America's wildlife!
Bart,Face on a mountain!
Bart,"And on July first, 1898, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and his band of Rough Riders charged up San Juan Hill and liberated Cuba."
Bart,"Hey, maybe Chalmers would let you guys sit in on our lessons. After me, men!"
Bart,Chalmers would actually take us out to see the rocks.
Bart,My book is missing page thirty-two.
Bart,My desktop is sticky with soda from the kid that had it before me.
Bart,"Hey, Gary."
Bart,"Well, what would Teddy Roosevelt do?"
Bart,I call this meeting of the Brotherhood of the Spectacles to order. Our mission: to get Chalmers back his job.
Bart,I'm thinking of something big. So big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till Chalmers gets his job back!
Bart,"Well, Dad, since you are taking an interest in us, maybe I should tell you..."
Bart,There's a car with its lights on in the teacher's lot.
Bart,Late-'90s model...coffee stains on front seat...
Bart,Taking over the school. With all the kids inside!
Bart,Great. You can call her from the closet phone.
Bart,There really is a phone in there?
Bart,So immature.
Bart,"Yo, teachwads! The Brotherhood of the Spectacles has taken over the school!"
Bart,Suit yourself. We all rubbed it with boogers.
Bart,"Okay, we've gotta stay focused: Jimbo, gather all the students in the gym. Milhouse, take a nap. You know how cranky you get."
Bart,I need to know that Chalmers will be taken care of!
Bart,Thanks. But these rough riders aren't dismounting until you get your job back.
Bart,"Oh my God. Milhouse, did you take your nap?"
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Sir, of all the books and movies about Teddy Roosevelt, which would you say is the most informative?"
Bart,One or two?
Bart,Dad? Dad?
Bart,He opened his eyes! Mommm!
Bart,Can his funeral be on a school day?
Bart,"Hey, Dad."
Bart,Well... there's a tall boy in front of me in class so I can't see the board.
Bart,Yeah!
Bart,Yep.
Bart,"And whatever you do, avoid the urge to make homemade gifts."
Bart,"Oh, did you pick that big scab off your knee?"
Bart,Who cares? I'll be President of Hell by then.
Bart,I'll tell you my project: a fisteroid hitting the planet nerd.
Bart,"Jeez, I put a lot of time in this. Back to the drawing board."
Bart,"No, the science fair's not till next week!"
Bart,"How is it ""accidentally"" when this is the fifth time?"
Bart,"That was preventative, this is morning-after... eh, you're right."
Bart,What am I gonna do? Good ideas don't grow on trees.
Bart,Or do they?
Bart,Not really -- I was trying to bounce it off your left testie.
Bart,"Look, I need help with my science fair project."
Bart,"To sweeten the deal, I'll pick you first for basketball."
Bart,"Well, we gotta come up with something. Hey, what if we make some kind of robo-pet?"
Bart,Where? Is it Nelson?
Bart,"Baby seal, huh?"
Bart,Awww.
Bart,Check it out.
Bart,"So, the soft fur, big eyes and gentle motion are designed to make it one helluva pet with none of the poop."
Bart,Yeah!
Bart,And best of all I got funding for my Homer Humiliator.
Bart,Oh... um...
Bart,When did you take that picture?
Bart,"Hi, we need someone to re-program our robots to break out of jail."
Bart,VIP passes!
Bart,"Games don't have lives or points anymore, Dad."
Bart,"Whoa! ""Guts Of War Two: Entrails Of Intestinox!"""
Bart,Colon smash! / Rectum kill!
Bart,Finished it.
Bart,"Well when you meet them, tell them your game's too easy."
Bart,Dad! Funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in Hall G!
Bart,Conventions rock!
Bart,"Save us, Fun Dad!"
Bart,"That isn't an ""X,"" Mom."
Bart,Sports?
Bart,"I hate it when grown-ups call kids ""gang."""
Bart,We're not a gang! Gangs are cool!
Bart,"Um Mom, where are we?"
Bart,"Yeah, just have fun -- Dad would."
Bart,"Whoa, spicy! I wish I lived in Ethiopia!"
Bart,So grab a pancake and slurp some slop!
Bart,Goorsha!
Bart,"Aw, come on, Dad, be a foodie! You're already a fatty and a drunkie!"
Bart,And then brag about it on the internet!
Bart,I feel bad for all those places that didn't make the cut.
Bart,"Oh sorry, Dad. Our blog is so popular, we got an invitation to the most exclusive restaurant in town. Kent Brockman himself could only get a reservation at five-thirty or nine-thirty!"
Bart,"Sorry, Dad -- this is our thing now."
Bart,Relax -- Dad will be the life of the party. He'll be the fourth Mouth-keteer.
Bart,Where's Dad?
Bart,A hundred pork chops!
Bart,We ate mad-scientist food and broke up a meth lab in the same day!
Bart,Fun Mom! Fun Mom! Fun Mom!
Bart,How is that the lesson? The point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do an asteroid's gonna wipe us out. So we should party hard and wreck the place.
Bart,Lisa has a big toy! No fair! That means I get two small toys!
Bart,"No fair, then I get four small toys and Lisa gets one medium and one small."
Bart,Choke on fossil poop!
Bart,"Whatever the job is, I'm not interested."
Bart,I like the beat -- play me the tune.
Bart,"Chapter-book crowd? That's a juicy peach, but what's the cream?"
Bart,Tween-lit gang-write?
Bart,A Zephyr?
Bart,This better not turn out like Kansas City.
Bart,"Come on, Skinner, you're the best kid-man in the business. You've read their notes, searched their lockers -- you know how tweens think."
Bart,"With your share of the money, you could get your own studio apartment..."
Bart,"Our crew needs you, Bouvier. You've read enough fantasy novels to choke a Hippogriff!"
Bart,All we need now is a computer guy...
Bart,"I keep going over the job from every angle, but I can't shake the feeling that we're missing something."
Bart,"Like no one ever writes for money, Lisa. I don't see your boyfriend William Shakespeare missing too many meals."
Bart,"Okay, we've cased a lot of tween books -- what's their M.O.?"
Bart,"No one's goin' anywhere. Okay, the vampire genre is sucked out. All we gotta do is find a new monster to be our hero."
Bart,"A troll, that's it! Our book could be about an orphan troll!"
Bart,"Okay, Gaiman, you're in. Your job is to get lunch. And lose the British accent."
Bart,"It's good. ""Weekly Reader Star Selection"" good."
Bart,"Oh, you didn't write any of it!"
Bart,"Hope you don't mind us printing our book in your room, Lis."
Bart,Correction: finished manuscript.
Bart,Fake author?
Bart,"Okay, stay frosty! All we need to do is find some sap to pretend to be the writer of our book. So hit the floor and find some pathetic wanna-be author!"
Bart,"Square as ""Golden Books,"" Pop."
Bart,"But Lis, when this book comes out, you'll be beloved! Not just by Milhouses, you'll get attention from Jacksons, Xanders -- even Aidens!"
Bart,"Rule number one of book heists: ""never fall in love with the book."" We queer the deal -- we lose the money!"
Bart,Yeah?
Bart,Let's steal back our book.
Bart,"The book prints at midnight. So if we swap in the original version , they'll print the wrong book -- our book."
Bart,The central computer is through here. All we have to do is upload our file and--
Bart,Kansas City.
Bart,A traitor?
Bart,Our book! The real one!
Bart,Is there any better feeling than waiting for a live Krusty show to start?
Bart,Hmmm.
Bart,"Milhouse, I'm gonna win that thing."
Bart,"Hey, I wrote the application. Do any of my friends get to come?"
Bart,Where's the nachos you promised?
Bart,Read to Lisa? Why don't you just ask me to kiss her?
Bart,I'll read! I'll read!
Bart,"All right, Lis, let's get this stupid bedtime story over with."
Bart,If genn-i-oos--
Bart,...is eternal pati... pat-eh... pa-tie...
Bart,"Shut up! Shut up! I'm a bad reader, okay?!"
Bart,"I don't want your help! I'll get one of those jobs where you don't need to read, like French fry maker or general."
Bart,Forget it.
Bart,I guess.
Bart,"""But when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo found her promise very hard to keep."""
Bart,Big deal. You taught me to read one book.
Bart,What?!
Bart,"Look, I had to read it to my sister."
Bart,Nice save.
Bart,"""...and Amy and Jo hugged one another close, and everything was forgotten in one hearty kiss."" End of chapter eight."
Bart,"Aw, come on, guys, it's getting dark."
Bart,What a rip.
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,Whoa! The gun Sheriff Baby wore! Hm.
Bart,Who's Fatso Flanagan?
Bart,He always comes back really religious.
Bart,I like the early closing time.
Bart,"Well, people also love a quitter... Sarah Palin... The Beatles..."
Bart,"Krusty, you know her?"
Bart,"They're pretty funny. Once I used one on Milhouse. He was wishing for his parents to get back together, but the flame never went out."
Bart,"Krusty, you're getting the best reviews of your career!"
Bart,"Krusty, my man, you finally hit it big."
Bart,Can't we just send out a picture of the pets dressed like reindeer?
Bart,Who cares what we look like in whatever stupid year this is?
Bart,"Not me, man. This cycle of jerks has to end."
Bart,Thanks.
Bart,Why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding?
Bart,"Lisa, do you really need all these Kurt Vonnegut novels?"
Bart,"We don't need dental floss either, Mom."
Bart,I call shotgun!
Bart,It's never too early to call shotgun!
Bart,"""Fatso Goes Nutso!"" And post to YouTube with the following key words ""fat,"" ""stupid,"" ""classic Simpsons,"" and, just to be safe, ""baby rides kitten rides penguin."""
Bart,Perfect.
Bart,"From now on when someone asks me, I'm gonna say you are my father."
Bart,That's not you. They just painted Shrek yellow.
Bart,Could there be anyone awesomer?
Bart,I love that guy.
Bart,I did it just to mess with your mind.
Bart,Lethal inject her on the electric chair!
Bart,Withdrawn.
Bart,We totally wasted his time.
Bart,Ever get tired of those dancing waters?
Bart,Hop on!
Bart,"Helpful hint: if you want friends, don't use words like ""conundrum."""
Bart,Jimbo heard me say it. I'm dead.
Bart,I just un-friended Skinner!
Bart,A thousand kids?! If you could get each of them to send you a dollar you'd be a millionaire!
Bart,"Check this out. I'm hiding a bomb in this pile of corpses, so when Kearney loots their ammo, he gets a face full of ass shrapnel."
Bart,We don't need your website. We can make anything into guns.
Bart,That's even sadder than being friends with Milhouse!
Bart,"Tired of what? I dump on you, and you take it -- that's how friendship works."
Bart,What gives? He's not crawlin' back.
Bart,Milhouse!
Bart,Milhouse!
Bart,"Listen, um... after our fight, I couldn't sleep."
Bart,"C'mon, man. At least listen to what I have to say."
Bart,Um... well... this is usually the part where you say you're sorry.
Bart,"I know, I made you into a real boy last week."
Bart,Wait. What? No!
Bart,"Milhouse! What do I have to do, besides changing in any way, to get you to forgive me?"
Bart,"Really? It's not that bad, is it?"
Bart,"Milhouse, you're the closest thing I have to a brother. A brother with the wisdom of an older sister. And that's why we squabble, 'cause families always do. But in the end, they're still a family. What do you say... brother?"
Bart,But-but-but...
Bart,"What's for dinner, ma?"
Bart,"C'mon, man. A few more balloons and this'll look really awesome."
Bart,Milhouse.
Bart,"I've been out here all night, man. Just let me know what it'll take for you to forgive me."
Bart,Sure.
Bart,"Sure, what've you got? Puppy Goo-Goo comin' my way?"
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,From now on I'll dominate you... in ways you don't realize.
Bart,That's a bill.
Bart,Maybe we should just watch TV.
Bart,"Luckily, she doesn't know that our viewing platforms are... multi."
Bart,"That might be a good idea, but then again, you thought it up. Eh, why not?"
Bart,Why does the guy have to do everything for the girl on Valentine's Day?
Bart,"Today we tackle the most terrifying ""myth"" in the history of Springfield Elementary: that if you press E-8 on the candy machine, you get electrocuted and die."
Bart,Something like that.
Bart,"Ladies and gentlemen, that myth is... cracked!"
Bart,"According to the wisdom of our elders...if you go all the way around on the swing, your body will turn inside-out."
Bart,"He's still inside-in, folks! And just to prove it:"
Bart,"Legend has it a girl named Eleanor Mackie drowned on this very spot. Now they say if you call her name three times while looking in this mirror, you will die. Milhouse?"
Bart,Okay. That was the last school myth and it's officially... cracked.
Bart,You into cigars now?
Bart,I can't be the guy who killed everybody's fun. That's Skinner's job.
Bart,"Milhouse, I've just figured out a way to make school cool again."
Bart,I have found one last myth to destroy -- the so-called legend of Groundskeeper Were-Willie.
Bart,Prepare to be disappointed!
Bart,"Gentlemen, we just created a myth."
Bart,Not me.
Bart,But Bunkerball is keeping us sane!
Bart,Yeah! I could sneak into the school and write whatever I want on the chalkboard!
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Hey, Henrietta Hippo, I've got to drain the inchworm."
Bart,I just got started!
Bart,Should I get my helmet?
Bart,Is there gas in these?
Bart,Well how are we supposed to get fuel?
Bart,"How're you doin', Mr. Assange?"
Bart,Yes it does.
Bart,You sure this is a good idea?
Bart,I'm on it.
Bart,Lenny Lenford. You're a long way from your barstool.
Bart,"Come on, man, we wouldn't leave you behind."
Bart,Accident! Here comes another one!
Bart,It's like going to Hawaii without the murderous locals!
Bart,"Open mine! Quick, before it suffocates!"
Bart,Check it out! It's on TV!
Bart,"I saw this picture at Grandma's house, then I hit the pet stores till I found one that looked just like it."
Bart,"Aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity."
Bart,"No way, man! I'm a free-range kid!"
Bart,Don't wanna come out.
Bart,I like it in the cage. These cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.
Bart,"But it's my home now, sir."
Bart,Fine.
Bart,There. Finished.
Bart,"No, you dweeb. It's a stencil. I'm gonna take Homer's ugly face and spread it all over town."
Bart,You're in.
Bart,"No, no, I'm too concerned with unemployment."
Bart,"Dammit, she knows! Okay, how do we buy your silence?"
Bart,How is fur murder? They're just animals.
Bart,Fine. Fur's murder. Everything's murder.
Bart,"Thanks, Milhouse. We make a great team."
Bart,The jerk in the glasses did everything!
Bart,"Oh God, man! Here, drink this paint thinner."
Bart,What was that name again?
Bart,"Man, you're the talkiest bullies I ever met."
Bart,"Hey, I got an F in art. Mainly so it would say ""fart"" on my report card."
Bart,"Well, if it's in a Gallery, how is it street art?"
Bart,"Well, I'll have to discuss it with my partner."
Bart,"First, I'm not sure you have the shoulders for it, and second, maybe we've pushed this far enough."
Bart,Count me in.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"I carumba? Not so loud! If my Dad hears about the show, he might realize Mr. Fatso is him!"
Bart,"Thanks guys, I um... huh, this collar's feelin' pretty tight."
Bart,Help! Helllp!
Bart,"Oh, this is just a dream. All I have to do is wake up."
Bart,"C'mon, Dad. You made me mad so I got back at you. How was I to know parents had feelings?"
Bart,I wanna show you I understand how you feel. And they say a picture's worth a thousand words:
Bart,Correction. It's worth ten times as much.
Bart,"You're welcome. And from now on, Dad, if anyone laughs at you, they've gotta go through me."
Bart,"Wait, is the Hulk laughing, or the rhinoceros?"
Bart,"Dad, it's getting cold out here."
Bart,"Art lovers and Bart lovers! First of all, I'd like to thank the good folks at Springfield Arts Daily for setting this up."
Bart,"As a graffiti artist, there're so many people to thank... people who build walls... nighttime, for being dark..."
Bart,It was?
Bart,"Wait, Chief. I must know... who tipped you off?"
Bart,There you go.. thanks for comin' out...
Bart,I need to go to the bathroom.
Bart,That's a lotta eights!
Bart,"I can't believe you got all your friends in trouble, and you got the day off!"
Bart,"Isn't karma where if you do something bad, bad things happen to you?"
Bart,What's goin' on? Is this a joke?
Bart,Trying to fix your broken brain.
Bart,"Wait, dreams have rules?"
Bart,Not me when I hit the dance floor!
Bart,In your dreams!
Bart,"Hey Dad, if this is your fantasy world, how come Flanders is here?"
Bart,"Man, Homer, you've always been a loser."
Bart,Pathetic. A kid who can't keep his parents' marriage together is no kid at all.
Bart,"Company physical coming up, huh?"
Bart,...you're hosting my Preteen Braves meeting...
Bart,...and we're gonna make dreamcatchers out of litter we pick up.
Bart,"Hey, check it out! Lenny's hit a new low!"
Bart,"Hey Dad, can we play?"
Bart,Amen.
Bart,Can I hollow out this one's head and use it as a turtle tank?
Bart,That movie's for babies.
Bart,My friend and I only see it to rank on it.
Bart,Get that stuff off!
Bart,Now!
Bart,"Hey, nametag! Do you know who her boyfriend is? Jimbo Jones!"
Bart,"Listen lady, you do not two-time the man with the skull t-shirt."
Bart,"Oh, that is cool. Looks like two snakes trying to kill each other on your head."
Bart,"I'm actually in fourth grade, but I read at a second grade level. They think I might have a ""problem."""
Bart,I gotta go -- he's my ride.
Bart,Why can't you do it?
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Huh?
Bart,I stole this...
Bart,"Uh, yeah, me. I use it all the time."
Bart,MI-MI-MI-MI-MI...
Bart,Isn't that what used to be the Beanie Baby store?
Bart,Don't worry. I made sure he can't get too far.
Bart,"Hey, the first time we lost Maggie was in this store."
Bart,What could a girl have that I--
Bart,No!
Bart,Doesn't anyone here realize I'm only ten years old?
Bart,I'm just not ready for cookies!
Bart,What any boy would: push you in a puddle and run away.
Bart,"Listen... I could get wedgied for this, but Jimbo's a jerk. You can do better."
Bart,"Well, who wears a wool hat to a pool?"
Bart,It's not fair! You know that's hilarious!
Bart,I'm on the grass apron!
Bart,"Oh, thank God! Mom will pound them!"
Bart,"Oh, it's you."
Bart,Then go back to Jimbo and show him every boob you've got.
Bart,"All right. Follow me, to a place where nerds, dorks and dweebs can gather in safety."
Bart,"Okay, we'll go to my second choice."
Bart,You're a bully?
Bart,"Man, they have every entrance covered. You'd have to be a Navy Seal to get in or out."
Bart,What are you doing here?
Bart,You don't want me?
Bart,"Well, that is one lucky creepy guy."
Bart,"It's okay, Dad. He's just putting the fear of God in me."
Bart,Monday... here we go again...
Bart,"Sorry kid, but there comes a day when that just doesn't do anything anymore."
Bart,"Want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want!"
Bart,WANT!
Bart,"Mom, Dad, do you know there's a boat out there where nothing sucks? It's called Royalty Cruises and Royalty Cruise specialists are standing by now!"
Bart,"Okay... maybe I can pay for the cruise. Let's see how much it costs for a cabin on a low deck, no porthole, group Z lifeboat access... It's still a ton of money."
Bart,And there's a DVD library of movies that haven't been released yet!
Bart,"I sold all my stuff, and it's still not enough money for the cruise."
Bart,"I can't, I sold my ""dinner futures."""
Bart,It's okay. I don't have much of an appetite tonight. I'm going to floor.
Bart,Mooooom! Daaaaaad!
Bart,I woke up and the money jar was full! That means the devil accepted my bargain. Now to uphold my end of the deal!
Bart,Snowball II!
Bart,Really?! But that's been in your family for generations...
Bart,"It's weird to hear myself saying this, but... I love you guys. This is gonna be the best vacation ever!"
Bart,"Look, that's our ship!"
Bart,What?!
Bart,I can offer you a cabin on our sugar-free fitness cruise...
Bart,Upgrade!
Bart,Double upgrade!
Bart,I knew it. It was all a dream.
Bart,I actually did it -- a perfect vacation!
Bart,"Whoa, a ""fun schedule!"" There's so much to do! ""Laser-Tag"", ""Waterslide Bobsled"" Oh! ""Ice Cream Snowball Fight"" starts in five minutes!"
Bart,"Alright fun schedule, you're about to get did!"
Bart,Where did the ship stop again?
Bart,I'm just glad everyone is having the best week of their lives.
Bart,"The song's right! No matter how much fun I cram into this cruise...it'll only last a week. Then it's back to Mom and Dad fighting, Lisa moping, homework, bullies, and a lunchbag sandwich soggy with the sweat of a juice-box!"
Bart,"After this cruise, for the rest of my life, it's all downhill..."
Bart,Why can't vacation last forever?!! I've got to do something.
Bart,They're buyin' it. They're buyin' it!
Bart,"""Chillingly plausible"" indeed, Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal."
Bart,Now to make sure no one can call home to check... with a little help from the make-your-own-sundae bar.
Bart,Woo-hoo! Vacation forever!!!!!
Bart,What a load of crap!
Bart,"Hey guys! Can you believe how awesome this is? If it wasn't for this virus thing, we'd all be back at our old sucky lives -- instead you're here, where you can be lovey-dovey all the time! Come on, kiss! Kiss!"
Bart,"Hey, Lis! At least you nerds are still geekin' it up. What could be sweeter than a vacation that never ends?"
Bart,Can't anybody enjoy their forever vacation!?
Bart,"Check it out: the gallery was gonna throw these paintings overboard, like they were worthless garbage?"
Bart,"Yeah, a movie! It is about time you guys started havin' some fun!"
Bart,Uhhhhh... gotta go!
Bart,"It was all a hoax, there's no virus."
Bart,That was just Treat Williams in a virus movie.
Bart,"All that happened is we got a little extra vacation, is that so bad!?"
Bart,"That's fair. Sorry. I deserve it. Ow, that one really hurt!"
Bart,"I wasn't being selfish, I did it for you guys, too!"
Bart,"Lisa, you made friends with kids just like you! Mom and Dad, you were more happy and in love than I ever saw you!"
Bart,It was the best week of all of our lives... and I wanted it to last forever.
Bart,"They spend all their time trying to raise a baby, and why? So it can grow up and do the same dumb thing on and on forever!"
Bart,But the slide's just like our cruise! A short awesome thing that just shows you how boring the rest of your life is!
Bart,Stupid Nelson! I hate that guy.
Bart,Nelson took my lunch money again!
Bart,Hmmm.
Bart,"Nelson, I could give you my lunch money... or, I could give you..."
Bart,I just thank God you didn't take my coupons. Got enough for a month.
Bart,"No, you give them the coupon and they give you the hamburger."
Bart,"No, you're imagining things."
Bart,This is a happy ending?
Bart,What'd you just say?
Bart,Why do we have to audition for this stupid play and Dad gets to leave?
Bart,Krusty Versus the F.D.A....
Bart,Hitler Mash-ups.
Bart,"Yeah, why aren't we doing Lenny's story? That thing's hilarious."
Bart,"Hey Dad, you remember when you said if Flanders got remarried you'd eat your hat?"
Bart,"Yo, Homer! Mom says get your fat ass over to the Flanders'!"
Bart,Which one? Homer or fat ass?
Bart,"/ Get your hands off of me, you fat ass--"
Bart,"What the hey, Mrs. K.?"
Bart,Want my advice on dealing with the Hardly Boys?
Bart,I don't. I'm just bored watchin' worms drown.
Bart,"Well, what you've gotta do is get them into the real world."
Bart,"If you don't act now, when they grow up, people like me are gonna take all their money and girlfriends."
Bart,Shut up!
Bart,Maggie knows how to keep a secret. Why can't you?
Bart,I'm keeping a dolphin in my bathtub!
Bart,Prank you! Prank you very much!
Bart,"What?! Without awards shows, how would I know what movie has the ""best beheading,"" or that ""Glee"" is a comedy?"
Bart,"Hey, Dubya."
Bart,She just found out no one likes her. I thought she knew!
Bart,Ay carumba! Somebody's actually on your side!
Bart,"""Lisa doesn't judge other people. Why should we judge her?"" It's signed, ""Truth Teller."""
Bart,"Hey Lis, some fifth graders are having a make-your-own pizza party at Flesh-In-The-Pan Pizza, and wanted me to invite you."
Bart,And read books where the parents are divorced. That joint is jumpin'.
Bart,"""Lisa rocks, and so does her rock collection."""
Bart,This notebook is full of things Truth Teller said!
Bart,"This one says ""post next Friday."" Oh my God! You're Truth Teller!"
Bart,"Lady Gaga, meet your biggest threat: Baby Googoo."
Bart,"Oh good, she's playing."
Bart,I hear tapping from inside.
Bart,"So, is this a date date, or just a meaningless friend thing?"
Bart,"Well, if you two ever get serious and have a baby, it'll look something like this."
Bart,Geek leak!
Bart,"Dance with me, please. I need to zing my sister."
Bart,"Just move your girdle, Yertel."
Bart,"Hey Lis -- your dance partner just made the cover of ""Dorks Illustrated"" Magazine."
Bart,"Hey, plenty of babes have docked at Porto de Barto."
Bart,"Oh my God, is that true?"
Bart,"Oh man, Lisa's right -- none of these relationships lasted very long. Three days, one recess, half a field trip... why did I have to get so needy at the planetarium?"
Bart,"Dad, can I ask you a question? How did you ever get a woman like Mom to stay with you?"
Bart,Is that the only reason?
Bart,My ex-girlfriends.
Bart,I can't believe she ran away. And this isn't helping.
Bart,I'd better switch to the hard stuff.
Bart,"Um, that's awesome. But I think I'll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me."
Bart,"Mary Spuckler, you're my last chance."
Bart,"Yeah, she got to drink milk as a kid instead of white paint."
Bart,No sir.
Bart,"A, B, C..."
Bart,Is Mary here?
Bart,Dadgummit! Do you think she still likes me?
Bart,And why is that?
Bart,"Mom, can we go to New York to find this girl I used to know?"
Bart,"Well, don't buy 'em!"
Bart,"C'mon, Dad. You love New York. Now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated: Old Penn Station and Shea Stadium."
Bart,"Why, ladies? Why?!"
Bart,We're safe because you have to climb steps to get up here.
Bart,But don't the people wreck your house when they stay in it?
Bart,"Come on, let's go find Mary! This is the address her brother gave me."
Bart,Hey!
Bart,I guess my search for true love is doomed.
Bart,"Thanks for asking, Duchess. I'm sittin' here waitin' for a girl that's never gonna show up."
Bart,"Girls don't like me. I don't really like them yet either, but I think I'm gonna. There's a storm a-brewin' down there."
Bart,Wow. What are you doin' for money?
Bart,Let's talk about somethin' else. Something nice.
Bart,Yeah... plus I thought I might get to see an air conditioner fall on someone's head. But I guess that never really happens.
Bart,They let Sideshow Bob out of prison again.
Bart,Huh. Didn't know they still ran those trains.
Bart,Trying to find high culture at low prices.
Bart,I could listen to your twang all day.
Bart,Can I do a rap in the middle of it?
Bart,ROLLIN' ON MY SKATEBOARD / PIMPIN' LIKE A DRUG LORD...
Bart,Um... I've gotta go.
Bart,"Uh, well, since we're here, I'm gonna go try to get Al Roker's autograph."
Bart,Um... I'm gonna go try to sell this.
Bart,I can't.
Bart,"I can't, because Mary's the girl that proves that girls can like me. And she wouldn't like me anymore if I gave her up. So I won't, even if you torture me like you do the English language."
Bart,"Thanks, man."
Bart,The best submission will be animated and appear on the show!
Bart,I'm submitting mine now.
Bart,"Dad, you forgot to pick me up after Little League!"
Bart,Let's see what we're dealin' with here.
Bart,"Y'know, it's really not fair you're charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover!"
Bart,That's impossible!
Bart,Or is it?
Bart,Nineteen seventy-four! I won't be needing this.
Bart,Now to get my comic book and explore a world where no one's mad at George Lucas.
Bart,"Eh, pretty good. A little preachy."
Bart,It's Homer! Before his boobs came in!
Bart,"Hey, Homer."
Bart,"I'm your unwanted son from the future, who killed all your fun!"
Bart,Ay carumba! If you guys don't get together... what does that mean for me in the future?
Bart,I don't exist?
Bart,Or... my life might be a hell of a lot better!
Bart,"Ma'am, whatever you do, do not marry that ape."
Bart,"Now to return to a future where I'm either rich or allowed to stand in front of a rich guy's house. Either way, better than now."
Bart,My Dad is Artie Ziff?
Bart,Oy carumba!
Bart,Give yourself a wedgie.
Bart,I love my life. I love it not. I love my life. I love it not.
Bart,"Mom, how come you didn't do my homework last night?"
Bart,Oh no! Lisa's face... it's the same!
Bart,"Oh, man -- I gotta climb stairs? Forget it."
Bart,Lousy surface dwellers...
Bart,Are the credits transferable?
Bart,"That guy has a bone to pick with the Board of Regents. Hey, Lisa's not getting on the bus."
Bart,I don't know. Dork farm? Who cares?
Bart,Fine. We'll follow her.
Bart,The five boxing wizards jump quickly? Whoa! My sister's finally become... mildly interesting!
Bart,I don't hear anything.
Bart,Boxing wizards. Boxing wizards. What's she up to?
Bart,Maybe I should go on anti-psychotic meds.
Bart,Lowering your blinds. I'd hate for your carpet to fade.
Bart,What are you doing Tuesdays and Thursdays after school?
Bart,"Write stupid stuff on the chalkboard. And if you have any ideas, I'm really running out. Today's was ""mousetraps are not slippers"" or something. Now what are you up to?"
Bart,Can I use that on the chalkboard?
Bart,"Gentleman doesn't ask, lady doesn't tell. Now all I need is one for Martin Luther King Day."
Bart,"Lisa's going somewhere after school two days a week. And all we have are boxing wizards. If we're gonna find out what Lisa's up to, I'll need the help of all her old boyfriends."
Bart,Way over. We gotta save that poor girl. Anyone know how we get home?
Bart,"Okay, baby, let's see the flop... Dammit! Lost again."
Bart,I'm only down sixty-two dollars. Not counting my tips to the waitresses.
Bart,"Fine, fine."
Bart,"Or, time to walk away from the table."
Bart,"Aw, c'mon, Lis. No gambling story has a happy ending, except Seabiscuit. But you never hear about the ruined lives of the people who bet against him."
Bart,"Oh man, this is priceless, but I can't keep it up. You've still got a college fund."
Bart,I'm Sideshow Bob!
Bart,I've been using his avatar to play poker and trash his favorite restaurants on Yelp.
Bart,And I saved your vegetarian bacon.
Bart,"Listen... after I won, the website found out we were both under eighteen, so we're back to the original five thousand."
Bart,Did you give the money back to the people who lost it?
Bart,Because I actually like you and felt sorry for you.
Bart,Forget I said anything!
Bart,I know this music! It was a Bugs Bunny!
Bart,I did.
Bart,LISA EATS BU-UGS...
Bart,"Okay, but when I grow up and I'm living on your couch, and I drink all your booze, and sell your jewelry, you gotta be cool."
Bart,But I will not be sharing my mini-fridge with Homer.
Bart,"Eh, free is free."
Bart,I really think that's coming from our house.
Bart,How 'bout the Disney Minority Program?
Bart,I'm the son of an oaf.
Bart,You said we were gonna see somebody get shot!
Bart,"Dad, all the jury summons you buried in the back yard are coming back up!"
Bart,Then you explain that.
Bart,Hey Dad!
Bart,"Dad, over here!"
Bart,"Dad, look, I'm walking on the wall around the lion pit!"
Bart,"Dad, I'm walking on my hands, and the lions think they're gonna eat me!"
Bart,Just my arm.
Bart,Gotcha!
Bart,Cool.
Bart,Check out all these Sergeant Activity dolls!
Bart,Fine. You have a weird old version of something. Let's just watch TV.
Bart,"I think I'm done here. Lisa, go nuts."
Bart,"Yeah it was great! This one guy was part of another guy's gang, I mean ""kkangpae,"" but then he quit and joined another kkangpae, and when the guys in the first kkangpae found out, they were so mad they put his feet in a blender. Then they cut to a guy eating noodles and blood splashed on him!"
Bart,"Come on dude, this party rocks! Love the temporary tattoo station!"
Bart,Hey! My dad worked really hard to make that. He took a class to learn denim painting!
Bart,No one bad-mouths my dad except me!
Bart,"Have you been ""oh boy""-ing all night?"
Bart,"Look. That kid threw your present in the garbage, and he called you a poser and everyone laughed!"
Bart,"Yeah, I was sticking up for you."
Bart,"Ah relax, I'm over it. Why aren't you at the block party?"
Bart,Why do you think everything's lame?
Bart,"That's okay, he is pretty lame. Hey... wanna watch TV?"
Bart,Terrible commercials!
Bart,"Screw that, it's Krusty time."
Bart,I've labeled all his boxes!
Bart,Um... where's Santa's Little Helper?
Bart,I don't see him anywhere. You jackass! You lost our dog!
Bart,Santa's Little Helper! Santa's Little Helllper!
Bart,What the hell?
Bart,"Hey, Lisa's right. You're the only one who hasn't cried about the dog."
Bart,He's alive!
Bart,"Dad, why'd you shut our dog in a cabinet?"
Bart,"Hey Homer, how come you're not hugging the dog?"
Bart,I don't think you even like Santa's Little Helper!
Bart,You have a story with an ending?!
Bart,"Man, this story is filling in a lot of gaps."
Bart,Finish the damn story. I've got a hockey game tonight.
Bart,"Yeah, but at least it was short."
Bart,"C'mon, boy. Time to go to bed."
Bart,"All right, Homer. It's your moment. But he's mine tomorrow."
Bart,"""Learn Zone?"" Mom, you said we were going someplace fun."
Bart,"Dad, what would you do if you got my ear in the mail?"
Bart,You'd have to wrap cheese around it.
Bart,Dad! / Come up! / Pretty please! / Come up!
Bart,"We tricked you! / Eat Nerf, Homeboy!"
Bart,"Hey, Dad. Are we going camping?"
Bart,What's up? Going crazy again?
Bart,"Guys who call themselves ""preacher"" or ""deacon"" are very bad. Water is money unless gasoline is money. And even though lots of things are razor-sharp, no one ever shaves."
Bart,"Aren't they just saying ""refrigerator?"""
Bart,"Bye forever, Milhouse!"
Bart,Ay carumba.
Bart,"Dad, how are we supposed to spend the rest of our lives here? We're already bored."
Bart,"Yes, sir."
Bart,"Oh God, now what?"
Bart,I've got to be honest with you. It was just a bag of rice I drew a face on.
Bart,I never noticed.
Bart,"Dad, you said people would be drinking each other's blood."
Bart,"Hey, don't blame me -- I didn't even take the test."
Bart,I had something better to do.
Bart,Driving you crazy instead of pulling off your legs. I've really matured.
Bart,"When I think begging, I don't imagine someone standing up."
Bart,"Sorry, I can't grant a favor to someone I don't respect anymore."
Bart,Wheee!
Bart,"Thanks for the freedom of speech, dorks."
Bart,Nothing a few George Washingtons won't solve.
Bart,"Principal Skinner, could you help me sharpen this pencil?"
Bart,I can't do this. I'm not ready.
Bart,"Well, I slept on my books, so I might have gotten something through osmosis."
Bart,Uh... pajamas?
Bart,"Pull the fire alarm. I'd do it, but everyone's lookin' at me."
Bart,"Well, well, well."
Bart,Looks like Mr. Vanilla just grew some chocolate chips.
Bart,I won't. I'm gonna ignore everything else on my schedule.
Bart,"They will be, Seymour. They will be."
Bart,"When I start, I'll tell ya."
Bart,"Hey, why aren't you eating that?"
Bart,Mrs. Krabappel? Are you a... teacher of the night?
Bart,"No, no!"
Bart,What have I done?
Bart,"Lisa, I wanna pass that test, but I need your help."
Bart,"I have all sorts of problems: lack of attention, I'm afraid of ovals, I only know twenty-four letters... don't you fall asleep on me!"
Bart,It's hopeless. I can't make up for ten years of goofing off in one day. I need two days!
Bart,Uh... B?
Bart,Will you stop that?!
Bart,"The least common blood type is A--B, B--A, C--A.B., D--O. D'oh!"
Bart,"That'll do, bug. That'll do."
Bart,Doges?! Why do we have to play this stupid game Lisa likes?
Bart,"No! Whenever we play that, my elbow touches Dad's junk."
Bart,"Mom, I am so glad you're alive."
Bart,"Sure, why not?"
Bart,"Oh yeah, I'm a wreck."
Bart,Never!
Bart,And why are we wearing our good clothes?
Bart,"Oh, I see. You guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night, rolls over, and crushes mom."
Bart,How 'bout asking that Japanese guy who set the world record for eating hot dogs? He's like a successful version of dad.
Bart,Whoa! Look at that guy!
Bart,"Wow, a man's stomach can be flat?"
Bart,Um... why don't we discuss it over dinner?
Bart,All you need to know is I'm a politeness monster who eats please and farts thank yous. Ma'am.
Bart,Is that arrrs or hours?
Bart,Well I'm afraid that we don't want to be with anyone but Mom and whoever she chooses to be with.
Bart,If you call this living.
Bart,Can't I just stick it in Skinner's Sloppy Joe?
Bart,Mary Spuckler!
Bart,I thought you left home to be a star.
Bart,That's your hand?
Bart,"Get out of my face, cootie breath! I did miss you. You stink! Come over Saturday. I'm gonna have to push you in the mud now."
Bart,Mary?
Bart,It's eight in the morning!
Bart,"Doctors Without Borders, you're now doctors without faces!"
Bart,"Soon, baby, soon. Let me just kill Milhouse's character. He thinks we're on the same team."
Bart,"Oh Mary, you know you're the coolest person I've ever hung out with."
Bart,"Hey, relax. She knows she's the apple of the corner of my eye."
Bart,Not at all.
Bart,A lot of musical talent in this house. But no one blows on a blade of grass like you.
Bart,"All eyes on you, baby."
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Well you're gonna win, 'cause you've got star quality. Like the Hulk in movies other than ""The Hulk."""
Bart,...and then I ran right home to you.
Bart,More like balder and wider.
Bart,I don't know what she wants. What would my heroes say?
Bart,It's hard to pick just one of those.
Bart,"Um... lifting people's spirits is an interesting topic. For centuries, Neanderthal and astronaut alike have enjoyed lifting spirits."
Bart,"Mary, we've just been through three hours of music. Usually, I only have music one hour a week, and the teacher spends it reading real estate listings for Fire Island."
Bart,Mary? Are you okay?
Bart,Melvis? Where's Mary?
Bart,Am I getting dumped?
Bart,Good idea. I can chuck eggs at the other couples.
Bart,Back pats?! This is a break up!
Bart,Give me another chance. I'll be way more attentive to your needs on the seesaw -- I'll stay down there for as long as you want.
Bart,"Little talk? You guys are having a big fight! This is the problem with women! They don't say what they mean, until it's too late!"
Bart,When do I get a Krusty suitcase?
Bart,So this is where you go when Mom kicks you out?
Bart,What's this notice on the wall?
Bart,"Aw, man! We just missed it."
Bart,"Um, I've gotta make a phone call."
Bart,"Mary? That's odd, I thought I was calling the Suicide Not Line. Because I'm doin' great. So, um, how are you handling ""taking a break?"""
Bart,Why did I buy her that rhyming dictionary?
Bart,"SPUCKLER MARY, PLEASE FORGIVE ME / ALL I ASK IS ONE MORE CHANCE..."
Bart,I miss Mary.
Bart,Hard to believe that country used to rule anything.
Bart,"DAD, DON'T BE A CREDIT HOG"
Bart,NOT BAD FOR A MOVIE DOG.
Bart,But I'm the main guy in this story! Things are supposed to work out for me!
Bart,Woo hoo!
Bart,Who are you?
Bart,Oh yeah!
Bart,"Dad, what are you watching?"
Bart,"That's the way people talk about Ralph! Ralph, whose favorite color is peanut butter!"
Bart,Aooga... aooga... aooga...
Bart,Twenty-four hours? Where'd you pull that crazy number?
Bart,"You're right, I'm bored. Epoxy fight!"
Bart,"Don't worry, I'll clean it up. Get me some whipped cream and a safety scissors."
Bart,"Don't worry, all I need is a cigarette lighter and some sandpaper."
Bart,"All right, let's just use a razor."
Bart,"Oh my God, you look just like your dad!"
Bart,Let's see how far we can take this...
Bart,"And finally, the tie."
Bart,Now sing the alphabet song!
Bart,What if we... Van Houten to the max?
Bart,Nah. Back to the sweet spot.
Bart,"Milhouse, if people believe you're a grownup, we could do anything."
Bart,"Okay, first, tone it down. Time to teach you to be a man."
Bart,Nice. Time for your final test.
Bart,Now you're the same height as your Dad.
Bart,"Now, did you get Kirk's license?"
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"""Kirk,"" remember you have the super-powers of a middle-aged man."
Bart,Really?
Bart,Just one sec: Nelson gave me some notes on a prank I'm doing.
Bart,"Now, I asked you here because I know a cool grownup who will take you to that club in the city."
Bart,"Au contraire, starfish hair!"
Bart,The Baby Poindexter Company is being forced to pay a settlement to any parent who had enough misguided love to buy their videos.
Bart,"Well, if I look at your face, I get sick."
Bart,"Make me, baldy."
Bart,Pretty shapes tell me to kill everybody.
Bart,That's all you pay for screwing up a child for life?
Bart,"Lady, my stomach's full and I wanna go. That's how it works in this country."
Bart,I sure hope not.
Bart,Mine's full of hand mirrors.
Bart,You sure you're not just doing all this because it's cool to be accepting of a gay family member?
Bart,It's weird that you don't consider yourself a young person.
Bart,"Grampa, you were the original bad boy!"
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,But Grampa...
Bart,I wanna hear about old-time wrestling too.
Bart,I'll bring you home my dessert.
Bart,You settled that Swede's meatballs!
Bart,"I can't wait to see Grampa kick some ass! He's always pretended to be boring, but he's really a straight-up psycho!"
Bart,Can I have one! Can I?
Bart,"You show 'em, Godfrey! You're the prettiest old man in the world!"
Bart,Why do you still have a thing for Nelson?
Bart,"What kind of person, indeed?"
Bart,You are the luckiest people in the world! You get to look at me!
Bart,"Listen, getting people riled up is what heels do!"
Bart,"Well sure I am. I always thought Grampa was lame, but he's really awesome!"
Bart,"You know it, Glamorous. Eye gouge, ear bite, folding chair, hair pull, face-fart, flying face-fart, and then I start fighting dirty."
Bart,"Sure, here you go."
Bart,The world is my ring now.
Bart,You all stink!
Bart,What are you doing?
Bart,"But, but, what about the cheating?"
Bart,And the preening?
Bart,But I'm so pretty.
Bart,"Honest Abe, can I pin him?"
Bart,"They're cheering, Grampa."
Bart,Yo.
Bart,I know. Posted a video online.
Bart,"Easy, easy. Let's not jump to conclu--"
Bart,"You guys, I swear I didn't do it."
Bart,"I know this looks bad. And I admit, I would totally lie in a second to Lisa or Mom or Dad. But I would never lie to Maggie."
Bart,I did not do that prank.
Bart,No.
Bart,"Yeah, why would you play chess through the mail when you can play chess through the internet, or preferably, not play chess at all?"
Bart,It's not a threat if I don't know what it means.
Bart,"Thanks, I'd like that."
Bart,"This case is goin' great. Although as usual, I look nothing like the courtroom artist's drawing."
Bart,"Nice try, pop."
Bart,"Pass the gravy, Gloria Allwrong."
Bart,My wha?
Bart,"You saved me, Lis! For the rest of my life, you'll always be my ""one phone call."""
Bart,Don't need to. I've got you.
Bart,"Oh, I'm sorry, that means I threw yours out. But I still have a couple of your mini carrots."
Bart,What's the matter? Not a vegetarian?
Bart,"Milhouse, where are you going with this?"
Bart,"Lis, you saved us!"
Bart,"Gentlemen, the fort is complete and will stand forever."
Bart,It's making me see them!
Bart,D'unno. Why are your friends such drunks?
Bart,Cool! They give you a bag of the bedbugs they killed.
Bart,"Homer's oatmeal, meet your raisins."
Bart,What's the hurry?
Bart,Dad?! You always hated church!
Bart,"The only thing bigger than you, is you tomorrow."
Bart,"Dad, the Oogle street camera's driving around town today. Wanna go moon it with me?"
Bart,Mr. Flanders? This new reverend has thrown tar in your half-pipe too?
Bart,Well let's get Lovejoy back. Do you know where he is?
Bart,You mean he's selling hot tubs?
Bart,"He's right, these underwater speakers are amazing!"
Bart,The only cool thing about my dad was that he hated church. And now he's turned into a fat version of Flanders. No offense.
Bart,Plagues...
Bart,"Ew, locusts. Darkness, yawn. Bingo! Flanders, are you willing to get Lovejoy back by hook or by crook?"
Bart,"Yes, but if I do something will you look the other way?"
Bart,And that's why Flanders will never ever be my partner in crime again. Thanks for bailing me out.
Bart,"First, we got every dead bedbug in town."
Bart,Now to leave a nice clean trail of bugs out of the swamp... the frogs follow... and Hooper's got a plague he can't handle.
Bart,"Ugh, one of these bedbugs is still alive!"
Bart,"Ah, much better."
Bart,"For every one of my cartoons that you erase, I rip up a family vacation photo. And just so you know I mean business, here's an ear!"
Bart,"Hi, I'm looking for a Mister Ron -- first name Moe."
Bart,"Okay, final checklist. Checklist ready?"
Bart,Mom and Dad still gone?
Bart,You mean my sister?
Bart,Clueless little Lisa doesn't suspect a thing.
Bart,"Five seconds to slip-off. And four, three--"
Bart,I gave him a caramel. He should have been chewing for hours!
Bart,"I've got you, Grampa!"
Bart,Please be okay...
Bart,HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE / HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE...
Bart,"Yes, Grampa!"
Bart,"Man, I must really love him."
Bart,Thank God your mental powers haven't deteriorated.
Bart,I was supposed to be in charge of you. I can't let Mom and Dad know what I did. But I promise I'll take good care of you until you're well again.
Bart,"There, there, you'll be fine. I'll take care of everything you need."
Bart,"Yes, but do you need one?"
Bart,"Uh, he told me he was going to nap most of the week."
Bart,Time for your meds.
Bart,"Go pink! Come on, pink! / Come on, blue! Come on, come on, come on, take it, take it, there you go, yes!"
Bart,"After a pulse-pounding race, hypertension pills win again!"
Bart,"Grampa, we've been spending so much time together, I almost feel like you're part of the family."
Bart,And I've been wondering... not like I miss having my afternoons free or anything but... are you starting to feel better?
Bart,"Okay, okay! Just checking."
Bart,Pass.
Bart,"Grampa, I made your favorite dinner -- teething biscuits soaked in buttermilk."
Bart,"You're completely fine! I've been taking care of you, giving you love and attention... for nothing!"
Bart,But Mom said it was a gift made with love.
Bart,No. Even she thought it was crap.
Bart,Well... you are the first thing I took care of that didn't die.
Bart,TV's gotten so lousy.
Bart,TV's not so bad.
Bart,If you're worried about your Mother's Day present it's in the works.
Bart,Pass.
Bart,"Bye, now."
Bart,Pass.
Bart,Yes... I want lesson.
Bart,Piano lesson.
Bart,"Wait, wait! I'm not learning anything! I'm just goin' 'cause the teacher's pretty."
Bart,I willll!
Bart,That is so beautiful. Did you write it?
Bart,Let me try.
Bart,Every good booger deserves flicking.
Bart,Whoopee...
Bart,What's wrong?
Bart,Awesome!
Bart,"Seriously, I'm gonna make you proud. I have hidden talents."
Bart,Thank you. I owe it all to Zhenya.
Bart,"Zhenya, I couldn't have done it without you. And you."
Bart,And now I'll always be at home in a saloon!
Bart,"Hi Zhenya, I'm here for my lesson."
Bart,Are there other people in here?
Bart,"If I got you all these students, shouldn't you be grateful?"
Bart,"Mom, you'd still be proud of me if I couldn't play piano, right?"
Bart,"You know, I'm almost eleven, it's not really fair."
Bart,"Hey, one of those notes could go to your brain and kill you. Are you sure you want to take that chance?"
Bart,I'm sorry! I was faking it!
Bart,I lied so I could see Zhenya.
Bart,But there's really only one girl whose opinion matters to me. My Mom.
Bart,Is it too late to make you breakfast in bed?
Bart,"Uh, Mom? I'm sorry I pretended to be good at piano-- And I'm really ashamed that I lied."
Bart,"Well, who am I?"
Bart,"Thanks, Mom. And that means no punishment, right?"
Bart,"Here's your new plate, Grampa."
Bart,It's our favorite show!
Bart,Are you gonna walk upstairs and ask her?
Bart,Dad! We don't watch that show anymore!
Bart,Kung Fu Werewolf chop!
Bart,Ninja Throwing Soap!
Bart,Ki-Ya Karate Monsters!
Bart,Actual Sword Attack!
Bart,We're broken.
Bart,Mom! Lisa made me break a lamp!
Bart,Grampa says he was a Commie.
Bart,Our gift is us!
Bart,Nothing should.
Bart,The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
Bart,"Yes it is, they're my lines as the scarecrow in ""The Wizard of Oz."""
Bart,Salt of the earth.
Bart,So many cookies will never be born...
Bart,"Yeah, it's tough being man of the house. You left some big underpants to fill. I didn't know they made Underoos in size fifty-two."
Bart,"More like the ""Expandables""!"
Bart,Why didn't you strangle me?
Bart,I'unno. 'Cause you're incapable of experiencing joy?
Bart,"I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?"
Bart,You guys know I don't talk to field agents. Get your boss on the phone.
Bart,Can we have some candy?
Bart,And we looked and we saw him...
Bart,He laughed as he heard that old codger's house-sizzles.
Bart,"The dude thought a while, then said:"
Bart,We had to escape from this behatted mammal...
Bart,"But if the gumbamel should ramble, then stumble, then just hop atop a Krustiferous Krumbull. But then if that Krumbull should happen to tumble, just call your amigo, the bee man of bumble."
Bart,"So please do not worry, 'cause we did okay."
Bart,"Yes, kids will get candy, whatever you say."
Bart,"Hey, if they get on an airbus, they know they're taking their chances."
Bart,Nowhere to tie my kite... and I forgot my scarf.
Bart,Bingo!
Bart,I'm alive! All patched up! End of story.
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Aw geez. Strangle me out of this, Fatso."
Bart,"Well, my show and tell is that I'm on Lisa's body--"
Bart,Well... she's pretty healthy for someone who's been living with cooties.
Bart,"Yeah, it's like looking down a Canadian tunnel."
Bart,"Sleep well, Lis. Somehow sewing my head on your shoulder brought us closer together."
Bart,Not the pony dream again!
Bart,"Hey, I did that!"
Bart,"Yep, that's me. When she's asleep I'm in control."
Bart,"Lis, I'm gonna make sure you stay asleep."
Bart,Now I'll just cut off her annoying head and this body will be all mine. Or we both die. Not really sure what the rules are.
Bart,A brother can never be friends with his sister!
Bart,I'm afraid I am.
Bart,"Well, wherever I am, it's gotta be an improvement."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,I'm Father O'Greedy! Dimes for the needy!
Bart,"My pants, like the Lord, work in mysterious ways."
Bart,"Fifty percent attention-seeking, fifty percent to drop things on people."
Bart,"Okay Bart, be cool. Calm down. You're not gonna die up here."
Bart,Help! Help!
Bart,Child in danger with exciting visuals!
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Dear Lord, please help me land safely, or transform this basket into a flying killer robot that I control with my mind, amen."
Bart,My God says it is!
Bart,"Now, I, Bart Simpson, shall send the first coaster down the track."
Bart,"But Milhouse, I already let you push me on the swings."
Bart,Milhouse!
Bart,Eat safety bar!
Bart,Because your seat was behind mine!
Bart,"Hey, Homer. Did you just fart?"
Bart,Whatever.
Bart,How much did this cost to restage?
Bart,Are the Pope's tweets infallible?
Bart,"No, you're not. Because if you tell people I cheated, that means your system failed."
Bart,Because then I'd be the one thing I swore I wouldn't: you.
Bart,Good luck with that. The only thing that'll change my mind is a sign from God.
Bart,"All right, I'll turn myself in. It'll give me a chance to work some more on the detention quilt."
Bart,"It's not American football, it's just football!"
Bart,"Mom, Lisa's ruining football."
Bart,He said he was going to work.
Bart,Are you nuts? You can't even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble.
Bart,She's heading for Prairie Dog Village!
Bart,"Therapy, please."
Bart,And the best part is I'm bombarding her with her own homework.
Bart,What's wrong with the one I got?
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Um... there's, there's a carumba in my eye?"
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,No! You never let me be Mike Singletary!
Bart,IF YOU TRY TO RUN / YOU'LL GET A HEART ATTACK...
Bart,HEY BIG MAN / DON'T WANT NO TROUBLE / I'M JUST HERE TO DO THE SUPER BOWL... SHUFFLE...
Bart,"Mom, after six weeks, I figured out that ""Sensei Weinstein"" is really my psychiatrist."
Bart,Ay carumba.
Bart,"I can help, but it's gonna get rough."
Bart,You don't know what rough is.
Bart,That ain't rough. More like a gentle breeze.
Bart,Maggie hits harder.
Bart,Did the goodnight pixie just kiss my cheek?
Bart,Okay. You got my attention.
Bart,"You wanna win this election? Then from now on, you do exactly what I say."
Bart,First go make me five pans of brownies.
Bart,Maybe Isabel likes baking.
Bart,"First we reel them in, then we scare the hell out of them."
Bart,"No, with balls to the head."
Bart,And what programs would you cut to pay for this precious garden of yours? The new whiffle-bats? Pizza Friday?
Bart,"You gotta get on your game, sister. You think I'm tough? Wait till Gutierrez sinks her teeth into you."
Bart,Remember you've got an ace in the hole -- chocolate milk in the water fountains.
Bart,"Hey, we'll worry about that after you're elected."
Bart,"It's in the bag, Lis. Once everybody sees this."
Bart,Training wheels. She still uses training wheels. And watch this.
Bart,Leave the bottle.
Bart,I bet by the end of the night you're gonna look pretty good.
Bart,Hey Lis.
Bart,No hard feelings. A lot of good things have been happening to me.
Bart,Were you thinking it?
Bart,Aooga!
Bart,"Submerge! Periscope! Aooga! Aooga! Die, Nazi octopus, die!"
Bart,Ice cream sandwiches. Why?
Bart,"Mom, is that true?"
Bart,"No, you're wrong! You're all wrong!"
Bart,"No, Skinner said I had a clean slate. So right now, I'm as good as any other kid."
Bart,Mom!
Bart,"Thanks, Mom. I'll start by taking my plate to the dishwasher...wherever that is."
Bart,"To avoid temptation, I'm getting rid of all the things that could get me in trouble at school. I buried all my whoopee cushions in the back yard."
Bart,That's not where I buried them.
Bart,For what?
Bart,"Firm but fair, sir."
Bart,Don't want any troublemakers on our submarine.
Bart,"Front and back, sir."
Bart,"Aw man, five days without pranking. I'm getting strange red marks."
Bart,But I'm gonna make it.
Bart,What?! No! I'll be late! Skinner will cross my name off the list!
Bart,Hold for the President.
Bart,"Okay, I washed your car like you asked, I did your paper route, and I'm sorry. I really am. This could be the turning point of my life. Where you, as a school guy, made a difference. What do you think? Can I go on that sub?"
Bart,Skinner didn't let me go.
Bart,You think so?
Bart,"I know a kid should never turn to his father for help, but I got screwed. Is there anything you can do?"
Bart,You'll really help me get revenge?
Bart,Everything.
Bart,"We have a problem, Seymour."
Bart,I did everything for you and you stabbed me in the back.
Bart,She's in a better place.
Bart,Seymour! The cops are on their way!
Bart,Here's a bus ticket to Juarez and your fake I.D.
Bart,No you don't. Yet.
Bart,Dad?
Bart,Thanks for stickin' up for me.
Bart,"Sure, Dad."
Bart,"Ah geez, when did everything turn to crap?"
Bart,Welcome to our daycare center... all girls please move to cootie quarantine.
Bart,Just don't lose this claim ticket.
Bart,What makes you think that?
Bart,Bless you.
Bart,"I don't think you're giving them what they were promised, Dad."
Bart,Where do the people sit?
Bart,And wand.
Bart,Don't make me learn about it.
Bart,Plastic bubbling vomit... plastic bubbling vomit...
Bart,"What?! Lis, you're smart. Why would you give me a book? 'Cause it's easy to wrap?"
Bart,"Actually, the idea to do this came from a book."
Bart,"What? No, I got it from this."
Bart,Because it's my present! Did you give it to me because you thought I'd like it or because you wanted to feel better about yourself?
Bart,Now did you check the room to make sure you haven't left anything?
Bart,"Need directions, or a bottle of water?"
Bart,Thank you sir!
Bart,"If you smell your farts in a dream, you die?"
Bart,Wow. But how'd you afford it?
Bart,Obviously.
Bart,"You're saying it's from Maggie, but actually it's from you. Thanks, Lis."
Bart,Now why don't you donate that to whatever hopeless cause you want.
Bart,"I wanna see ""Radioactive Man Re-Rises!"""
Bart,"Chins up, Homer. You don't need a theater to watch the movie. You just have to illegally download it."
Bart,Who knows? But it sure is easy. I'll walk you through it. All you have to do is--
Bart,And play!
Bart,I'm under thirty.
Bart,I'm on it.
Bart,I just want to know who dropped the dime on Dad. Lousy rat.
Bart,Homer just pirated a movie. It's not the worst thing Dad ever did. It's not even the worst kind of pirate Dad's ever been.
Bart,"Oh man, I would love to pirate that."
Bart,So... everyone's a pirate?
Bart,I'd be Jaden!
Bart,"So what do you think, Lis? Who are the good guys here, the media companies or the internet freedom guys?"
Bart,They killed off Radioactive Man?! I did not see that coming. Die carumba.
Bart,Homer!
Bart,Would you take me to buy a comic book Tuesday at midnight?
Bart,You never watched an episode of Jimmy Kimmel in your life!
Bart,"Oh yeah, more. A little bit more. Right there. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's the stuff!"
Bart,"Well, no way I'm giving a valentine to Nelson. He's a bully, and I do not love him."
Bart,"That's because Jesus knows one day he gets to look his enemies in the eye and say: ""It was me who sent you to Hell."""
Bart,"Fine, Nelson gets a valentine. An old one from the box."
Bart,"Perfect. Bad movie, bad pun, even bad paper stock."
Bart,Da-ad! Lisa's my little sister!
Bart,"Interesting. When was the term ""shut up"" invented?"
Bart,"Aw, come on, Mom!"
Bart,"No. No valentine for you, Nelson."
Bart,I'll give a valentine to a loser. I'll give a valentine to a dork. I'll even give a valentine to a girl. But I won't give a valentine to a bully.
Bart,And what if I don't?
Bart,"Hmm, interesting."
Bart,"Interesting means no... Milhouse, you're a genius!"
Bart,"Nothing. On TV, when a guy says something lame, another guy says he's a genius, and then he has an idea. I thought it might work for me."
Bart,"I hate this stupid holiday! The only thing you can do is screw it up. That's it! Bart, you're a genius!"
Bart,"This is what it means to everyone. How can you be forced to say ""I love you?"" People only give valentines because they're scared of what would happen if they didn't."
Bart,I rubbed it on Milhouse.
Bart,Amen! We're done!
Bart,"Mom, can I have some money?"
Bart,Dad? Please? For Sumadi?
Bart,Please!
Bart,Life is good.
Bart,What?
Bart,How could I?
Bart,"It's been a rough patch, man. Hope you got something to cheer me up."
Bart,"Money, money. I need money!"
Bart,I guess. Who are you?
Bart,Children of the playground! I will eat anything for money! Except money!
Bart,"Ay carumba. So, what else ya got?"
Bart,Easiest money I ever...
Bart,"Here's your money, dad."
Bart,Even you won't sit with me?
Bart,You're the ones that paid me to eat it.
Bart,Thanks. I'm the kid that ate the frog.
Bart,"Thanks for the help, man."
Bart,Wait! Wait! Wait! Who the hell are you?
Bart,To this school? On purpose? Even after Springfield Montessori opened across the street?
Bart,That place is really in your face.
Bart,This school has a falconry club? No way.
Bart,Can I join?
Bart,You were right about watching him fly.
Bart,Wow. You don't know how impressive that is to a boy whose dad can't even get the dog to sit.
Bart,"Bart Simpson, at your service."
Bart,Why would I want a nap?
Bart,I wasn't drinking. I was learning that nature isn't a complete waste of space.
Bart,"I met this kid. A little older, kind of strange. I don't think other people get him, but I just wanna hang out with him all the time."
Bart,"Fly! Fly! C'mon, man! Do the wing thing!"
Bart,I did it! He did it! We did it!
Bart,Whoa! Did you teach him to do that?
Bart,I get it. It sucks. Really sucks.
Bart,Wow.
Bart,I've already eaten.
Bart,Is a falcon's training leash called a creance? Yes!
Bart,Say something so I'll know you're not hurt.
Bart,Phew!
Bart,"Well... my Dad said don't bring home anymore dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds."
Bart,"Hey, you've had a lot of visitors."
Bart,Listen... what happened in that tree?
Bart,"You don't still think that, do you?"
Bart,This hospital has another doctor?
Bart,So they're transferring him to another hospital.
Bart,He's just riding the thermals from Dad's butt.
Bart,I never heard of this new hospital so I looked it up and printed it out.
Bart,Can I visit him tomorrow?
Bart,Diggs isn't cuckoo!
Bart,Milhouse abandoned me.
Bart,"So, why can't I go there?"
Bart,Then why is Diggs there?
Bart,What would you know about friends like Diggs?
Bart,So how do we fix him?
Bart,What kind of cheer-up talk is this?
Bart,You hug the bedpost. Then I hug the bedpost. That way we never hug each other.
Bart,I knew you'd escape! Were you carried out by a flock of falcons?
Bart,Were falcons involved in any way?
Bart,"Great. Before anything else, let me just get closer to the door and say ""how crazy are you""?"
Bart,"No offense, but when a crazy guy pretends to be crazy, it's not funny."
Bart,Why am I not surprised the only sport you do is one where a bird brings you food?
Bart,What are you doing?
Bart,Um... with our minds?
Bart,Wait. When will I see you? You can't quit the falconry club!
Bart,"Well, I guess some delicate birds are safer in a cage."
Bart,How long did it take you to think that up?
Bart,I'll take that.
Bart,Enough!
Bart,"Mom, you didn't cook the falcon?!"
Bart,Awww...
Bart,Fascinating.
Bart,This is getting boring. Either murder us or tell us how you got here.
Bart,Look at me! I'm Sideshow Bob!
Bart,"Yakety, yakety, yak."
Bart,"""The spotted hawk accuses me, he complains of my gab."""
Bart,"""I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable""... Walt Whitman, ""Leaves of Grass""."
Bart,"Very good. Lisa, you always were the one rose petal floating atop the cesspool that is the Simpsons."
Bart,/ That's mean.
Bart,Why would you want to do that? He's tried to kill us.
Bart,"Absolutely. We're talking about Lisa, right?"
Bart,You shut up!
Bart,"Jig's up, Bob!"
Bart,Return the spear to the homo erectus. Homo erectus? Where has that word been all my life?
Bart,You did that for me?
Bart,And we're scared of that because...?
Bart,"A little singing? If there's one thing he did not have to genetically enhance, it's his voice."
Bart,Well... I really think you should watch your temper.
Bart,Stupid kid. Do you really think that's the way we should communicate?
Bart,"Not what I was hoping for, but it'll do."
Bart,Hey! Leave him alone. I too know the pain of hand-me-down underwear.
Bart,"My dad buys the underpants gorillas wear during monkey shows. So if you're gonna laugh at Nelson, laugh at me too."
Bart,This can only be good.
Bart,This family has had a lot of hoods put over their heads.
Bart,Where am I?
Bart,"Um... thanks, but I'm not sure I want to be a bully."
Bart,Who's Chester?
Bart,Whoa...
Bart,Ay carumba.
Bart,I didn't shoot him!
Bart,I don't know. I feel naked without it.
Bart,Haw-haw.
Bart,Are you sure you didn't create a perfect habitat for you?
Bart,Well there's plenty of room... because Pokey's gone.
Bart,This looks like a job for... fireplace tongs.
Bart,"No, that's a much bigger animal."
Bart,But I want to see it!
Bart,For ourselves?
Bart,"You got it, Ceej."
Bart,"This one's against us. This one's for us. For, for, against, for, against..."
Bart,"He's been playing Dancing Revolution for hours, but the TV is off."
Bart,"You're not gonna let it go, are you?"
Bart,End this madness!
Bart,What makes you a hero?
Bart,"Oh, just make a speech about Dad."
Bart,"Everyone does that with good dads. But with our Dad, it's like climbing Mount Everest. You either plant your flag at the top of the world or get frozen in agony forever. Either way, Hell of a show."
Bart,"Look, you got us a free trip. Just slack off and cash your check like you always do."
Bart,"Man, Krusty should get some of these letters."
Bart,"While you were out, the gamblers sent up gold-frosted donuts, a chocolate bowling ball, and a fresh pork sandwich."
Bart,Went to practice her Portuguese.
Bart,"Dad, is it hard for you to turn these bribes down?"
Bart,"I'm just examining what kind of person I am and whether I should destroy your happiness forever. Eh, why not?"
Bart,You weren't Lisa's hero. She just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero.
Bart,Where are you going?
Bart,Now that's a broken man.
Bart,How's she doin' that?
Bart,"Hi, Dad! / Homer."
Bart,Don't want to be seen with you when you're hitting bottom.
Bart,And that's why I was tardy today.
Bart,Whoo! Safe!
Bart,Wha-- what are you doing in here?
Bart,"Well, I can't have cops sniffin' around here. Some of them might be girls."
Bart,"Hey, I bet you have a great smile."
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,So why'd you come here? I run a respectable treehouse.
Bart,You can't buy me with a candy bar that has coconut.
Bart,Nice real estate. You've got a deal.
Bart,I saw a guy with a gun and a snake tattoo say he was gonna hide out on top of Mount Springfield.
Bart,We outlaws have to stick together.
Bart,"Stolen bowling shoes, 3-D glasses, Krusty standee...and this ""cage"" for my pet."
Bart,My A.D.D. meds.
Bart,I'm busy that night.
Bart,Whoa.
Bart,It's the first I've seen it.
Bart,"I have a feeling this PlayStadium was ""liberated"" from its previous owner and given to me in gratitude."
Bart,"You can't spell ""crime"" without ""me."""
Bart,What the?
Bart,"Oh, yawn. Another freebie. Better be a sixty-four gig."
Bart,"Huh? It's full of lame apps: Bully Avoider, Nosebook, Insta-Grandma, This was stolen from Milhouse!"
Bart,Relax! Listen to the music of this bubble game.
Bart,I helped Snake out of a jam so he paid me back in stolen stuff. It was an honorable arrangement. But I never thought he'd steal from you.
Bart,You seem stressed.
Bart,You wanna suck some Squishee?
Bart,Careful. It's uncut syrup. They give it to horses before they race.
Bart,You ratted him out? He's got a kid!
Bart,"So you see, we can't let Jailbird fry."
Bart,I didn't say there'd be a sleepover.
Bart,"So you see, Chief, Snake wasn't stealing that stuff out of greed. He was stealing it to thank me."
Bart,You're going straight?
Bart,That man sure loved potato salad.
Bart,But our thing was camping.
Bart,Wow. Now I see why they call you Miss Hoover.
Bart,You must've been vacuuming for an hour.
Bart,"Wow. I'm free! Get ready, world! I've got a whole new set of mistakes to make!"
Bart,Ay carumba.
Bart,Ugh. Art.
Bart,"Every time I do art, some do-gooder teacher sends it straight to a therapist."
Bart,I've never acted on any of it!
Bart,Really? Wonderful? I just drowned a grasshopper in paint and let him crawl on the paper till he died.
Bart,"No it's not, because I hate art."
Bart,Stop encouraging me!
Bart,Shauna? What are you doing here?
Bart,I gotta find a way to get rid of my art teacher.
Bart,Is there a voodoo queen you can direct me to?
Bart,"Yes, ma'am."
Bart,"Uh, plastic."
Bart,"Okay, did you get Trunch's D.N.A.?"
Bart,How'd you do that?
Bart,VOODOO SPELL / VOODOO SPELL / SEAGULL BEAK AND BONE OF MEL
Bart,PURPLE HEART AND TEAR OF CHUM...
Bart,...SEND HER HOME WITH ACHING TUM!
Bart,"Oh, right, we need one more thing from her purse."
Bart,"Hm. She's got tickets to the play ""God of Carnage""."
Bart,"Sorry, but I don't think we'll be seeing much of Trunch today."
Bart,"Yep. I cast a voodoo spell on her. I won't bore you with the dark details, but let's just say she's in no condition for teaching."
Bart,"I admit, I did make a voodoo doll of Mrs. Trunch. But I just asked for a stomach ache, not a baby!"
Bart,So I did make her pregnant?
Bart,Just how do women get babies?
Bart,I didn't mean to make her pregnant. I just hate art so much.
Bart,"A minute of fun, a lifetime of work. I've never heard of a pregnancy like this."
Bart,I like to think I'm the boy that makes families.
Bart,"Hm, maybe I can help. But it'll cost you."
Bart,Five dollars. Plus one dollar haw-haw insurance.
Bart,BY THE POWER OF THIS PLACE / MAKE A BABY WITH A FACE.
Bart,Only if they have five dollars.
Bart,With them.
Bart,Just give me the cash and you'll get your drivers license back.
Bart,BARBECUE SAUCE AND TEDDY BEAR'S EYE / THEY WANT A BABY GOD KNOWS WHY...
Bart,"Maybe when I've got a Dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face, it sets, I don't know, a low bar?"
Bart,Aren't those full of germs?
Bart,"Look, Fat Tony. I don't know what you know about voodoo, but it only works on people. Horses? That's crazy talk!"
Bart,"Hey, this is all your fault."
Bart,"I wouldn't be here if you were more of a role model! Pub crawls, naked Frisbee golf..."
Bart,"Well, it's your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to Hell!"
Bart,What's his problem?
Bart,Big deal. I don't like girls either.
Bart,Whoa! They like each other!
Bart,What are you talking about?
Bart,WE'LL BE DEAD...SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD
Bart,OR TOMORROW WE WILL PAY!
Bart,ROLL IN HAY!
Bart,ROLL IN HAY!
Bart,ROLL IN HAY!
Bart,"Cool, another limo ride!"
Bart,Ay carumba
Bart,Dad!
Bart,Mom! It's not funny if I can't hear the cats drown in their own barf!
Bart,Culture's in decline! Deal with it!
Bart,Yay! A mess!
Bart,I can think of worse.
Bart,"The saddest thing would be if you were driving and texting Lisa, and you hit her. And the last thing she texted, before she died, was ""I got your message."" G'night."
Bart,Hmm. Nobody likes jazz that much. Even the guy playin' it had to take drugs.
Bart,"No one likes veggie smoothies that much. Or at all. Something's fishy about that girl, and I'm gonna follow her till I find out what."
Bart,I think I'll need you back at headquarters manning the phones.
Bart,Just let 'em ring.
Bart,"I've got two things for you: this envelope will change your life for the low, low price of five dollars, and I'll throw in a piece of great advice. Tempted?"
Bart,Don't open the envelope.
Bart,That's mine. It's for my library card.
Bart,Mother's Day?!
Bart,"Wake up, Lis! It's the last day of school!"
Bart,"Wake up, Maggs! It's the last day of school!"
Bart,Last day of scho-ol! Last day of scho-ol! Found my summer hob-by! Banging pots togeth-er!
Bart,I did that last summer. I'm not allowed back.
Bart,"Goodbye forever, multiplication!"
Bart,That's good.
Bart,No.
Bart,Why am I having nightmares? I'm no coward.
Bart,"A chicken feather? Why would you hand this to me? Oh, you must've figured out I chickened out during the race! Well who are you to judge me?!"
Bart,I suck?! You suck!
Bart,Hey buddy.
Bart,I brought you a cake. Read it.
Bart,Um... that's kind of a baby show.
Bart,Why would a kitten marry a crocodile? Wouldn't it eat her?
Bart,No! Turn it off! It's too intense for me!
Bart,Hey everyone. I sure got a lot of attention for winning this year's Race Around the School.
Bart,"Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Mel. But I am not here to talk about myself. Milhouse, would you join me at the podium?"
Bart,"I've gotta set things straight. During that same race, my friend Milhouse was in the lead, when something horrible happened..."
Bart,"Rather than try to figure out what happened, Milhouse had the courage to move on. To me, that's a hero."
Bart,"Grampa, everyone's callin' me a coward."
Bart,Come on. You were in World War Two.
Bart,But don't people hate cowards?
Bart,"Wow, that sounds pretty sweet."
Bart,Yes.
Bart,I understand. You have standards.
Bart,Milhouse! This is my chance to make things right!
Bart,Get on that bus! I'll explain during the explosions!
Bart,"...saw everything you did! Milhouse is the hero! Take it from me, the boy who's lied throughout!"
Bart,"Look, Maggie. I undid my deed. So I'm just gonna take your feather and say goodnight."
Bart,Where are these coming from?
Bart,Ohhh. I see -- that's all you wanted.
Bart,"How's that, kiddo?"
Bart,Don't you know what kind of animal we're dealing with?
Bart,"Hey, Dad! We made popcorn!"
Bart,Chief Wiggum shows us crime photos at sleepovers.
Bart,"Krusty, sorry about the roast. They had no right to say those hilarious things."
Bart,"Krusty, why don't you talk to your Dad? He'll cheer you up. He's a Rabbi. He must've learned something from that giant star scroll he's always reading."
Bart,Well no... but he's not a rabbi. More of a Flabbi.
Bart,"All right, you're not a Flabbi! Okay! I got it!"
Bart,"I'm gonna prove you did groundbreaking work. Krusty, I want you to binge-watch all the shows you've ever done."
Bart,"Hey, Krusty."
Bart,Yeah. And I've learned that all religions are equally boring. But there's a reason I went. Come and see.
Bart,Who's a hooker?
Bart,Rabbi Rudenstein. Your father's favorite.
Bart,"Yeah, I guess he just hated your delivery."
Bart,"Well, it wasn't easy, but we managed to watch every testicle fail video on the internet."
Bart,"I guess there's nothing left to do but go outside and play. Wait, a sponsored link!"
Bart,I don't know what that stuff blocks.
Bart,The cereal on the bottom gets soggy.
Bart,Why should I? It's just gonna get dirty again.
Bart,I'll get to it when I get to it.
Bart,"Hm, I'm not feelin' it."
Bart,Why do I need to eat broccoli?
Bart,"Look, I'll drink another glass of milk."
Bart,Pfft. You'll never out-sit me.
Bart,The sit is on.
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,"And so... the fat man caves. If you need me, I'll be up in my room eating cereal. Half a bowl of cereal."
Bart,Now I am never eating that broccoli.
Bart,I'm in.
Bart,"Oh no, the broccoli!"
Bart,Where are we?
Bart,No.
Bart,We've been kidnapped!
Bart,"Hey lame ass. Thanks to you, we're stuck on a stupid therapy boat."
Bart,Now can we respect each other?
Bart,What does that mean?
Bart,"Sheep shank, bowline, clove hitch..."
Bart,"Dad, look! I did a round turn with two half hitches."
Bart,So what if I am?
Bart,I'm old enough to choose my own things to hate. And the things I like! And I like being a sailor.
Bart,"Just like you taught me, Captain. Over, under, over, under, over, under, under, under, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, under, over, half hitch."
Bart,Yi-yo-yu!
Bart,Now I'm the ship's highest ranking officer. It's up to me to get us to shore.
Bart,Dad! We can make it to harbor if we can just sail around that lighthouse!
Bart,"No, we need to sail!"
Bart,Can't you just do what I say?!
Bart,Put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet!
Bart,Mo-om! Dad's imagining me as food again!
Bart,"Sandwiches, Mom. Fill 'er up. And the garment bag."
Bart,I smash fluorescent lights at the gravel pit.
Bart,They replaced cigarettes as our currency.
Bart,"Yeah, sure."
Bart,"Mom, if you're gonna do this, there's one thing I need to know. And be honest. What's your soda refill policy?"
Bart,You're supposed to be driving me to a tennis class I said I wanted then I changed my mind and I hate it so much I'm faking stomach aches to get out of it.
Bart,"Well, if I'll be doin' this when I'm forty, might as well start now."
Bart,I'm home!
Bart,"Uh, guys... what the hell is that?"
Bart,"Mom, I need a few hours off. It's Milhouse's birthday party and I'm all the guests."
Bart,Grampa.
Bart,I got this.
Bart,He who reads this rune translation / will be taken to damnation.
Bart,Penal.
Bart,Penile.
Bart,Hm.
Bart,"Ow! Oh, someone could get really hurt by this."
Bart,Stick your finger in that desk.
Bart,"Huh?! We're in Hell?! Cool! Now I can look up all those people who said ""See you in Hell""!"
Bart,"Hey pal, what are you in here for?"
Bart,Ow! This has never happened before! I have a crush on my teacher!
Bart,"Every time the sinner screams in pain, the scream blows this windmill, which pumps even more piranhas into his aquarium underwear... causing more screaming."
Bart,Right here?
Bart,Hot Stuff? I didn't realize you were that evil.
Bart,"Mom, Dad... I want to change schools!"
Bart,"I found a place that really wants to teach me, and I really want to learn."
Bart,"Dad, it's not a private school. It's free."
Bart,"Mom, please tell me I can go to Hell."
Bart,Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Bart,Homer? That-that's my dad. I can't hurt him.
Bart,What? Why?
Bart,"Sayonara, sucker!"
Bart,Woo hoo! I'm the last of the Simpsons!
Bart,"Oh man, he made us watch him dance for three hours. And he really only has one move."
Bart,SHHH!
Bart,"I'm so proud of you, poppa."
Bart,I'm offended you think I forgot. Let's see...
Bart,Ta-da!
Bart,Better make this count.
Bart,Remember when this country didn't suck? 'Cause I don't.
Bart,"Uh, that's a mirror."
Bart,"Hey Homer, you gonna kiss him or kill him?"
Bart,Must be a secret government project.
Bart,"Yeah, like the guy who designed Bender just took a drawing of Dad and stuck an antenna on it."
Bart,"Wow, I'm doing the same jokes a thousand years later. Ay carumba!"
Bart,Well...
Bart,Let this be a lesson: never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule.
Bart,"Dad, it-it's me!"
Bart,February twenty-third.
Bart,You're nuts. I've got a will of iron.
Bart,Will you shut up?
Bart,You realize you're cheering the death of millions of my children.
Bart,"I dunno. But in ten minutes I'm gonna have him kneeling before Zod. In this example, I'm Zod."
Bart,When he opens the door...
Bart,I will not. Anything to delay a spelling test!
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,Terrible.
Bart,No.
Bart,This new teacher I got gave me a haircut.
Bart,No.
Bart,"No, you'll laugh at me."
Bart,Teachers union won the right in their last strike.
Bart,"Milhouse, I am gonna get back at Lassen. Now ""The Hobbit"" taught us that every dragon has a chink in its armor."
Bart,"I've created a fake Miss Hoover profile. When Lassen friends her, we'll know everything about him."
Bart,"We've all read the terms and conditions, Milhouse."
Bart,Maybe I am. So?
Bart,Here's Lassen's profile:
Bart,What the?
Bart,Tagged as Lassen!
Bart,"So if we go there with a camera to film Lassen humiliating himself, I'll get revenge for him making me into this!"
Bart,I was trying to even it out!
Bart,Nooo!
Bart,"Dad, don't worry, I got you a place."
Bart,There he is.
Bart,"Milhouse, everyone here is a total freak. We have to find a way to completely humiliate Lassen."
Bart,No. This Ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life. And I'm gonna wreck it. Because he scarred me forever!
Bart,Enough!
Bart,Fire retardant?!
Bart,"If Lassen can't light that thing, he'll be humiliated. What good is an Ignis who can't blaze the guy?"
Bart,"Help me, desert weirdoes!"
Bart,"Hey listen, we should probably get home. My Dad forgot to bring water."
Bart,"Everyone loves you, Dad. You could become a famous rock star!"
Bart,What's a game show?
Bart,You mean more popular but not as good?
Bart,"It's Christmas Eve, man! We do not want to set a precedent for fat guys being late tonight."
Bart,Christmas Eve. The one night a kid wants to go to sleep is the one night he can't. I can't have another cocoa.
Bart,My pee is starting to smell like a ski chalet.
Bart,"Oh, thank God you are here. I need to get to sleep. Tell me the story of jazz again."
Bart,"If it helps, I made you a card."
Bart,"Ah, yes... I remember Christmas Eve when I was eight."
Bart,"They say a boy never gets over seeing his Dad in a Santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on Christmas Eve. I'll help you, kid."
Bart,You're not a pushover.
Bart,Just chewing on the wood.
Bart,That's lettuce caught in a spider's web.
Bart,I thought we were just going to ask if he had seen Homer.
Bart,"All right, I'm sick of waiting."
Bart,It's nine-ten a.m.! I know what they're doing. They're up in bed watching the rebroadcast of the Hollywood Christmas Parade.
Bart,Oops. My finger slipped.
Bart,I got a baseball glove!
Bart,I want yours!
Bart,We did.
Bart,Bug be damned!
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,Pirates of the Caribbean!
Bart,Not enough ketchup!
Bart,How 'bout that one?
Bart,"Hey, Dad, I see a ride that actually looks decent!"
Bart,"No, look! It's a ride that just opened and no one's there!"
Bart,Who's gonna stop me?
Bart,Are you the guy that talks nice before they kill us?
Bart,"Before we vote, I'd just like to point out in Sophie's Choice she saved the boy."
Bart,"Hey look, Maggie made you a farewell card."
Bart,"Way to go, George Mucus. The fattest, stupidest man on Earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles."
Bart,Dad said I could try it.
Bart,I don't see any breasts.
Bart,At least Maggie can fly us home.
Bart,Is that true?
Bart,"Hey Dad, since we've gotta wait, can't we please see an act?"
Bart,I'm not convinced.
Bart,"Only the coolest kid ever could think of that! Good golly, Sven-Golly! You did it!"
Bart,Can he be nine so I can beat him up?
Bart,Then can we get pizza on the way home?
Bart,Good one.
Bart,"Homer, can't you sleep with Mom?"
Bart,Gross! Weird! Complicated! Go to sleep!
Bart,"If I'm gonna get through this day, I better Irish up my coffee."
Bart,"Oops, my homework!"
Bart,"Yo, this is tunnel tag. When you're tagged, you have to spread your legs and freeze."
Bart,"Every day's the wrong day to wear culottes. You're ""it""!"
Bart,"Oh, God, no."
Bart,"Yeah! Listen, Homer...do you ever think about what you want to do when you're grown up?"
Bart,"Hey, would you ever wanna have a real job and a family?"
Bart,Wow. He doesn't want to be my Dad. He just wants to be a kid like me. Almost makes me not wanna prank him. Almost.
Bart,Touché.
Bart,"If you wedgie me, my friend will beat you up."
Bart,"You did it, Homer! You saved me from the bullies! You're the coolest kid I ever met."
Bart,You're in the top hundred.
Bart,Now you're not.
Bart,Me too. And you know what? I'm afraid you might... change back.
Bart,Look in the lake. Tell me what you see.
Bart,No reason. Brother.
Bart,"Lis, you know how Dad thinks he's a ten-year-old?"
Bart,"Well, now that hypnotist is gonna come back and snap him out of it!"
Bart,Or isn't there not?
Bart,I wanted you to enjoy being a kid just a little longer.
Bart,No! You can't take him now! We've only been on two rides!
Bart,Fast Pass can't solve everything!
Bart,"Goodbye, friend."
Bart,Recommended by a kid I used to know.
Bart,You think so?
Bart,Well... maybe you sat on him and he was never seen again.
Bart,Get lost.
Bart,For once we're finally gonna catch that mouse!
Bart,Gotcha!
Bart,Squawky?
Bart,"Squawky, until I met you, I never thought I could love something bald."
Bart,Disable auto-drive.
Bart,"Musk rulez. With a ""z."""
Bart,Thanks for the real working light saber!
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,Tire fire.
Bart,Fatty and Smell-ya.
Bart,Sister weenie.
Bart,Lisa is blown away.
Bart,"Well, don't be so surprised, I did write that ""Lisa, It's Your Birthday"" song."
Bart,"Whoa. Thinking back, I'm kinda surprised Mom and Dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom."
Bart,"Hmmm, what's in it for me?"
Bart,"Whoa, that is the best deal any songwriter ever got. And that's true even if I don't get the brownies. I'm in."
Bart,What's it look like? Writing a song.
Bart,We make a great brother and sister team. Like Andy and Lana Wachowski.
Bart,"Hm, how about a fist bump through a towel."
Bart,SPRINGFIELD'S THE ONLY HOME WE'VE GOT...
Bart,AND THEY SHUT DOWN THE THINKHOLE...
Bart,'STEAD OF THE STUFF WE'VE GOT...
Bart,WE'VE ONLY HAD A HURRICANE ONCE!
Bart,We don't know.
Bart,How come Dad's not with you?
Bart,"Mom, Lisa and I learned we could solve any problem through song. Lisa, let's go write something that'll change Dad's mind."
Bart,I just wanted to get out of the room. She was really bumming me out.
Bart,"Aw, geez, I thought writing another hit song would be easier."
Bart,You take it!
Bart,I refuse to accept it!
Bart,It's her fault! She was suckin' all the gangsta out of everything!
Bart,"Nine-thirty, starting in summer! Mom said!"
Bart,"How come there's never a ""Take Your Son To Work Day?"""
Bart,"Good one, Dad."
Bart,"God doesn't hear my prayers. If he did, I'd be at home on the couch playing video games in a diaper."
Bart,"Mom, the freezer broke and--!"
Bart,Saluki Strut!
Bart,"Dad, mom trusted us with a secret--"
Bart,I'm telling her!
Bart,Are you... a hostess?
Bart,Is Dad in on this takedown?
Bart,"Yeah, we are grown up."
Bart,I go on hikes with my friends where we talk about our problems.
Bart,"""JINGLE BELLS, BATMAN SMELLS, ROBIN LAID AN EGG / THE BATMOBILE BROKE ITS WHEEL, THE JOKER GOT AWAY."""
Bart,"Oh, please. There's only one fat guy that brings us presents and his name ain't Santa."
Bart,"Yeah, they're cool and they last the rest of the your life."
Bart,All right!
Bart,"Good one, Dad."
Bart,Oh. Neat-o.
Bart,"All right, the mall!"
Bart,"One ""mother"", please."
Bart,"Twenty-one, sir."
Bart,"But, Mom, I thought you'd like it."
Bart,Cool!
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,Ow! Quit it.
Bart,Ow! Quit it!
Bart,Ow! Quit it!
Bart,Ow! Quit it!
Bart,Ow! Quit it. It used to be a real boss tattoo.
Bart,"Oh, Dad, you're finally home."
Bart,Huh?
Bart,Can we?
Bart,"Yeah, Homer."
Bart,"Hey, Milhouse. I dare you to sit on his lap."
Bart,"Ah, touché!"
Bart,"Hey Santa, what's shaking?"
Bart,I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Bart,Here?
Bart,"Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that."
Bart,Homer!
Bart,"Don't kill me, Dad. I didn't know it was you."
Bart,"I'll say, Dad. You must really love us to sink so low."
Bart,"Come on, Dad. Let's go home."
Bart,"Ah, come on Dad, this can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's gonna happen to us."
Bart,"Come on, Dad. They're all scrawny little bags of bones."
Bart,"It's a coincidence, Dad."
Bart,I got a bad feeling about this.
Bart,Uh...
Bart,"Oh, go for it, Dad."
Bart,"Come on, ""Santa's Little Helper!"""
Bart,"Come on, dog! Go, man! Go! Come on Santa's Little Helper! Run baby run!"
Bart,Go Santa's Little Helper!
Bart,"Come on, get that rabbit."
Bart,"Don't worry, Dad. Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens."
Bart,"It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me."
Bart,"Sorry, Dad."
Bart,"Look, Dad. It's Santa's Little Helper."
Bart,"Oh, can we keep him Dad, please?"
Bart,I'll pay! How much?
Bart,"Hey, everybody. Look what we got!"
Bart,"And if he runs away, he'll be easy to catch."
Bart,Like a light bulb!
Bart,Like strip poker!
Bart,Like Attila the Hun!
Bart,"Come on, Mom."
Bart,"As in, ""this game is stup-id."""
Bart,"My turn. ""Kwyjibo."" K-W-Y-J-I-B-O."
Bart,Twenty-two points. Plus triple word score. Plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here.
Bart,"Kwyjibo: Uh, a big, dumb, balding..."
Bart,North American ape... with no chin...
Bart,"Uh-oh, Kwyjibo on the loose!"
Bart,Yikes.
Bart,"Same time, same place?"
Bart,Eat my shorts.
Bart,"At seven-thirty a.m. an express train traveling sixty miles an hour leaves Santa Fe bound for Phoenix, five hundred and twenty miles away."
Bart,At the same time a local train traveling thirty miles an hour and carrying forty passengers leaves Phoenix bound for Santa Fe.
Bart,It's eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car.
Bart,"An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off, but three times as many plus six get on."
Bart,Oof!
Bart,"At the second stop, half the passengers plus two get off, but twice as many get on as got on at the first stop."
Bart,I don't have a ticket.
Bart,Yaaaaahhh!
Bart,"Oh, you bet."
Bart,"All the time, sir."
Bart,"Wow, it's like you're readin' my mind, man."
Bart,"Sign me up, Doc."
Bart,"Aw, come on, Mom."
Bart,No way.
Bart,"You're stifling my creativity, Dad."
Bart,"Maybe so, but from now on, this dimwit is on Easy Street."
Bart,"No rush, Dad. Take the scenic route."
Bart,"Oh, no. Ties."
Bart,"Thanks, Dad."
Bart,You kissed me.
Bart,"What should I read, ma'am?"
Bart,Ohhh!
Bart,What?
Bart,What's your problem?
Bart,Cool. Hamsters! What are their names?
Bart,"Hi, li'l control hamster."
Bart,"Oh, Mom! Not tonight."
Bart,"Well... you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't."
Bart,Whew!
Bart,"Well, okay."
Bart,"Well, all right."
Bart,Save your breath.
Bart,Os-os.
Bart,That's backwards for so-so.
Bart,All righty!
Bart,"Hey, Lees, keep an eye out for the guy with the peanuts."
Bart,"""Toreador, oh, don't spit on the floor / Please use the cuspidor, that's what it's for."""
Bart,"No way a bull is gonna miss a target that big, man."
Bart,It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
Bart,"Oh, yeah."
Bart,"Hey, guys! Great to see ya."
Bart,The what?
Bart,"Oh, no."
Bart,"Um, look Dad, I got something to tell you."
Bart,"All right, Homer, come on, baby. Right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind."
Bart,Whoa! Strike two! Two and two!
Bart,"Don't worry, homeboy, you're not that fast."
Bart,"Whoa! Yeah, strike three! You're outta there."
Bart,"Uh, nothin', Pop."
Bart,"Well, it's really pretty top secret, ma'am."
Bart,'Course I do!
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,"Lord, no."
Bart,I want to go back to my old class.
Bart,"Yeah, well, you know... kinda... but I was thinking I could go undercover."
Bart,"Well, I could pretend I'm a regular dumb kid. You know... to study them, and all the stuff they do with each other. You know, see what makes them tick."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Proposal?
Bart,"Gotcha, man."
Bart,"""My Proposal"" by Bart Simpson. I want to pretend I am a regular dumb kid... period. By this I hope... oh no... for this I will... um... require... Aw, man!"
Bart,My Confession by Bart Simpson. I am a regular dumb kid... period. I cheated on my intelligence test... period.
Bart,I had a little accident in chemistry today.
Bart,Dad... I gotta tell you something... Hope you won't be too mad...
Bart,"I'm not a genius, Dad."
Bart,"I cheated on the intelligence test. I'm sorry. But I just want to say that the past few weeks have been great. Me and you have done stuff together, you've helped me out with things, and we're closer than we've ever been. I love you, Dad, and I think if something can bring us that close, it can't possibly be bad."
Bart,Wuh-oh!
Bart,Yaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Bart,I can try.
Bart,"No way, man!"
Bart,Do you think I'm dumb enough to fall for that. I'm insulted.
Bart,"Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't unlock that door."
Bart,"Hey, Otto. Hey, Ottoman."
Bart,"Any new tattoos, Otto?"
Bart,Cool! I want one.
Bart,"Oh, please, Mrs. Krabappel, not next to Wendell. He pukes on every bus ride."
Bart,"No offense, Wendell."
Bart,And I was that boy!
Bart,Mrs. Krabappel...! Mrs. Krabappel...!
Bart,Can I pick the song?
Bart,"Oh, no."
Bart,"THEY TOOK BART SIMPSON TO THE GRAVEYARD / AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE SAND, OH, YEAH / AND EVERY LOCOMOTIVE THAT COMES ROARIN' BY / SAYS, 'THERE LIES A STEEL-DRIVIN' MAN, LORD! LORD! OH, THERE LIES A --"
Bart,"Hey, Wendell, you made it, buddy."
Bart,"What does ""incompetent"" mean?"
Bart,"Oh, okay. I thought you were puttin' him down."
Bart,"Hey, there's my dad. Hey, Dad! Yo, Homer!"
Bart,Woo! Woo! I'm up here!
Bart,"Yeah, go for it, Dad."
Bart,"Don't give up, Dad."
Bart,Is Mr. Freely there?
Bart,"Freely. First initials, I.P."
Bart,All he does is lie there like an unemployed whale.
Bart,"There's only one thing we can do. Take advantage of the old guy. You gotta sign my report card, Dad."
Bart,Mom! Mom! Wake up!
Bart,Someone swiped my piggy bank.
Bart,"Don't do it, Dad!"
Bart,"Yeah, Dad. / Yeah. / We love you."
Bart,"Cool, man!"
Bart,"Oh, yeah?"
Bart,"Oh, yeah?"
Bart,"Way to go, Homer!"
Bart,"Gee, Dad's a hero."
Bart,Nothin'.
Bart,"Right on, Dad!"
Bart,"Oh, yeah?"
Bart,"Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad watch out!"
Bart,"Oh, yeah?"
Bart,You love him more!
Bart,"No, I don't!"
Bart,No I don't!
Bart,I'm picking respect.
Bart,Bart.
Bart,"Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself."
Bart,Ooops!
Bart,"Whoa careful, Dad. Blow a gasket and you lose your job."
Bart,Yeah. Shut my mouth and let your boss win.
Bart,Hey!
Bart,"Man, this is pathetic. I'm goin' for it."
Bart,"Kiss you? But, Dad, I'm your kid!"
Bart,"No, me!"
Bart,"No, Me!"
Bart,Me.
Bart,"Yeah, Homer. Room for one more."
Bart,One of us! One of us! One of us! One of us!
Bart,These people are obviously freaks.
Bart,"Okay. Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub."
Bart,"Don't have a cow, Dad."
Bart,No belching.
Bart,"Whoa, look at this place. What a dump."
Bart,The fat guy on TV?
Bart,"Oh, c'mon Dad! Anything but that!"
Bart,"If you really want to impress her, show her the big empty space where our TV used to be."
Bart,"Right on, Doc. Another successful diagnosis."
Bart,All right!
Bart,"They'd work much better without the padding, Doc."
Bart,See.
Bart,Just testing.
Bart,Arrrgh!
Bart,My finger slipped.
Bart,Arrrgh!
Bart,Arrrgh!
Bart,Arrrgh!
Bart,"Hey, nice hair, Mom."
Bart,"You did it, Dad."
Bart,Yay!
Bart,Yum. Don't mind if I do!
Bart,"Oh, man."
Bart,"You know, there are names for people like you."
Bart,"Teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt kisser..."
Bart,Huh?
Bart,"Uh oh, school bus! Gotta go."
Bart,"Yo, Otto-man."
Bart,"Hey, can you believe it, man? My sister here made a whole pile of cupcakes to butter up her teacher, and she won't give anybody else even one measly little crumb!"
Bart,"Better let me hold these, Lis."
Bart,You sniveling toad! You little egg sucker!
Bart,Backscratcher! Foot licker! Honor student!
Bart,"All right, all right. Look. I'm sorry. I-I got upset. In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn't mean."
Bart,No.
Bart,Not really.
Bart,Does not.
Bart,Of course not.
Bart,A beautiful human being.
Bart,"Well, I'd have to say... your generous nature, your spirit of giving."
Bart,"Thanks, Lis. You're the best."
Bart,"Hey, what's the big idea? That's my sister, man!"
Bart,So give her back those cupcakes before I knock your block off.
Bart,"Uh, it was an ACCIDENT, man. A terrible ghastly mistake! Ask anybody!"
Bart,"Uh, oh. A cold wind!"
Bart,But...
Bart,But...
Bart,"Okay, Nelson. Put up your dukes."
Bart,"Uh, oh!"
Bart,I ain't gonna get outta the fourth grade alive.
Bart,But I can't squeal. It would violate the code of the school yard.
Bart,"Look, everybody. I would just as soon not make a big deal out of this. I'm not saying I'm not a hero. I'm just saying that I fear for my safety."
Bart,"Nelson, it was all a mistake. This is how it happened, man -- Listen up, you may get a kick out of it. -- My sister was baking cupcakes this morning and..."
Bart,"Boy, you sure taught me a lesson. Whew! Thanks guys. I guess now all that's left is a hearty handshake. Right guys?"
Bart,"Uh, not really."
Bart,Oh no.
Bart,"Oh man, that guy's tough to love."
Bart,"Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad."
Bart,Let's just say I paid the inevitable price for helping out my sister.
Bart,"I'm gonna miss you, big guy."
Bart,Dad... I need help... Please...
Bart,I had a run-in with a bully.
Bart,I guess I could do that.
Bart,I know.
Bart,"What do you mean, Mom?"
Bart,"Yeah, - he's pretty chunkified, all right."
Bart,No. He's pretty dumb. He's in all the same special classes I am.
Bart,"You mean I should fight dirty, Dad?"
Bart,Amen.
Bart,Yeah!
Bart,Gotcha.
Bart,"Thanks, Pop."
Bart,"Whoa! Ouch! Ow! Ooh! Oh no, boys, not the can, please."
Bart,What can he do?
Bart,He is?
Bart,I'm here to see Grampa.
Bart,"Well, Grampa Simpson then."
Bart,Thanks lady.
Bart,"Hi, Grampa!"
Bart,"I need some advice, Grampa. See, there's this bully at school who keeps beating me up."
Bart,"Hello, sir. Uh... Mr. Herman, did you lose your arm in the war?"
Bart,"Yes, sir. I will."
Bart,None.
Bart,Psst! Grampa! I think this guy's a little nuts.
Bart,"Okay. We all know why we're here, right?"
Bart,"To fight Nelson, the bully."
Bart,That guy's been tormenting all of us for years. And I for one am sick of it.
Bart,"I can't promise you victory. I can't promise you good times, but the one thing I do know..."
Bart,"Whoa! Whoa! All right, okay. I promise you victory. I promise you good times."
Bart,I got a B in arithmetic.
Bart,Woulda got an A but I was sick!
Bart,"We are rubber, you are glue."
Bart,It bounces off us and sticks to you.
Bart,Sound off!
Bart,Sound off!
Bart,Go! Go!
Bart,"What's the matter with you, soldier?"
Bart,Your nerves!
Bart,I won't have cowards in my army.
Bart,Ow!
Bart,"Sorry, man."
Bart,In English class I did the best.
Bart,Because I cheated on the test.
Bart,Sound off!
Bart,I can't hear you.
Bart,"All right, there's your enemy! Now hit him! Hit him! Let's go, next group! Martinez! Steinberg! O'Hara! Chang! Olajuwon! Herman!"
Bart,We are happy. We are merry.
Bart,We got a rhyming dictionary.
Bart,Sound off!
Bart,One more time.
Bart,Bring it on home now.
Bart,"Intelligence indicates he shakes down kids for quarters at the Arcade, then heads to the Kwik-E-Mart for a cherry Squishee."
Bart,"Two hundred rounds, sir. Is it okay if they say ""Happy Birthday"" on the side?"
Bart,Battle stations!
Bart,"Nelson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to teach you a lesson."
Bart,This one. Artillery...commence saturation bombing.
Bart,"Well, I guess you learned your lesson, so now I'll untie ya."
Bart,"Well... if that's going to be your attitude, I'm not going to untie you."
Bart,"Uh oh, he's right!"
Bart,"Wow, sounds good to me. Okay. I'll sign."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"Oh, boy!"
Bart,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Contrary to what you've just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars Trilogy. If you'd like to learn more about war, there's lots of books in your local library -- many of them with cool, gory pictures. Well, good night, everybody. Peace, man."
Bart,"Sorry, Dad. Women and children first."
Bart,Did you check the den?
Bart,"Warm... no, cold... colder... Ice cold."
Bart,No. I'm talking about your breakfast.
Bart,Did you try the rumpus room?
Bart,"Well, Mom, one of us has scarfed down more than enough cupcakes over the past three decades to keep him..."
Bart,Oh yeah!
Bart,Food fight!
Bart,"In the red trunks, with a record of forty-eight wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, Battling Bart Simpson. Whoopee! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh, correction, humiliating defeats -- all of them by knockout..."
Bart,"...Homer ""The Human Punching Bag"" Simpson. Boo! Boo! Hiss!"
Bart,"And Homer is down! Three seconds, folks -- a new record!"
Bart,"Yo, chump, you back again?"
Bart,I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. There's no way they can prove anything.
Bart,It isn't? There must be some mistake.
Bart,"Hey, you're right. This note's about Lisa."
Bart,"Gee, Homer. Looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands."
Bart,"Hey, man, I didn't do anything wrong."
Bart,Stupid Homer... Thinks he's so big... Stupid Homer... Stupid Homer. I'll show him.
Bart,Enjoy your bath?
Bart,"Oh. Too bad. Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub."
Bart,"Hey, don't say stuff like that about me to Maggie. She's on my side, anyway."
Bart,"Is, too."
Bart,"Is, too."
Bart,"Is, too. Watch, I'll prove it. Maggie, come to the one you love best."
Bart,"Come on, Maggie. The choice is obvious."
Bart,"Exactly, come to the one you love."
Bart,"Gee, Dad, you're really bad at this."
Bart,"Put up your dukes, Homer."
Bart,"I am going easy on you, but you're just so old and slow and weak and pathetic."
Bart,"Aw come on, I'll cheer you up."
Bart,Me three. What are we talking about?
Bart,"Oh, yeah. Easy."
Bart,"Oh, Mom."
Bart,"Don't make me say it. I know the answer, you know the answer, he knows the answer, let's just drop it. Okay?"
Bart,Okey-dokey.
Bart,"Hi, man."
Bart,Is Jacques there?
Bart,Jacques. Last name Strap.
Bart,"Where's your sense of humor, man?"
Bart,"I'm going to knock you out one more time and that's it. This is getting boring, man."
Bart,Whoa!
Bart,"All right, man. You asked for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy."
Bart,Wha' the...
Bart,"You're right, Mom. I'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing."
Bart,Rusty old hunk of junk.
Bart,"Shut up, Flanders. Hey dad, how come we can't get a decent mower like the Flanders?"
Bart,No.
Bart,"Wow, man! What an RV!"
Bart,"Does it have its own satellite dish, sir?"
Bart,Oh man!
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,I hate this. I don't want to go.
Bart,Turkey farm?
Bart,Skunks?
Bart,Slaughter house?
Bart,No!
Bart,Dad's feet.
Bart,"Are we there yet, dad?"
Bart,You mean like we just did?
Bart,"There aren't any dangerous animals in this forest are there, Dad?"
Bart,It's a deal.
Bart,Right.
Bart,"I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not..."
Bart,How do you know?
Bart,"Don't have a cow, Dad."
Bart,"I'm not the only one, Homeboy."
Bart,"Yeah, man."
Bart,"But dad, I'm so hungry. Can't we eat something first? I'm starving, man."
Bart,"What are we going to do, hang ourselves?"
Bart,"Right, Dad."
Bart,"G-g-good night, D-dad."
Bart,Are we there yet?
Bart,Are we ever going to be there?
Bart,Uh Homer. Bees!
Bart,How is it?
Bart,What?
Bart,"Oh. Water. Thattaway, man."
Bart,Arewethereyet Arewethereyet Arewethereyet?
Bart,"What do we do, Dad?"
Bart,Nice grizzles.
Bart,"Later, grizzly dudes."
Bart,"What the hell are you talking about, sir?"
Bart,Dad! Oh Dad!
Bart,"No, dad. This whole thing was my fault. You run along."
Bart,"Aw, dad."
Bart,Murderous mob. I beg you to spare our lives. At least until you've heard the story of how we ended up with the head of our beloved town founder.
Bart,Ah... about twenty three minutes and five seconds.
Bart,Okay. It all started Sunday morning...
Bart,Whoa! Are you talking to me?
Bart,Maybe.
Bart,"Uh ma'am, what if you're a really good person but you're in a really, really bad fight and your leg gets gangrene and it has to be amputated; will it be waiting for you in heaven?"
Bart,"Oh, oh, oh, me."
Bart,What about a robot with a human brain?
Bart,"Hey, guys, where'd you get all that great stuff?"
Bart,"Yeah. Among other things, apes can't get into heaven."
Bart,Our teacher.
Bart,"Ah, cool, man. Space Mutants 4. Drop me off! Drop me off!"
Bart,"Hey, Dad. Can I have five bucks?"
Bart,Perish the thought.
Bart,"Da da da da da da de de de Whoa! Ugh, Cowabunga!"
Bart,What?
Bart,It didn't hurt.
Bart,Nah. I might land on my face and end up lookin' like you.
Bart,You do?
Bart,I'm Bart Simpson.
Bart,You don't need an introduction. You're the worst kid in school.
Bart,You guys are sneakin' in?
Bart,But sneaking into a movie is practically stealing man.
Bart,"Well, okay. I just wanted to make sure we weren't deluding ourselves."
Bart,"Wow, man!"
Bart,"Three jumbo cherry Squishees and one double jumbo original flavor, sir."
Bart,"Don't worry, guys. It's on me. Share the wealth, that's what I always say."
Bart,Guys? Guys!
Bart,You ripped it off?
Bart,But that guy founded Springfield. He built our first hospital out of logs and mud. If it weren't for him all the settlers would have died in the great blizzard of forty eight.
Bart,So... watch me hit him right between the eyes.
Bart,"That one looks like the statue of our town founder, Jebediah Springfield."
Bart,"Does too. I mean without the head, of course."
Bart,You do?
Bart,"But guys, come on. Don't you remember history class? Jebediah once killed a bear with his bare hands."
Bart,"C'mon guys, knock it off!"
Bart,Ah!
Bart,"Dad, can I talk to you about something?"
Bart,Well... I was wondering... how important is it to be popular?
Bart,So like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better?
Bart,No.
Bart,No.
Bart,What have I done?
Bart,"Oh yeah. Top of the world, Ma."
Bart,"G-o-o-o-d morning, everybody."
Bart,I gotta go.
Bart,It's just a statue.
Bart,Uh-oh. School bus.
Bart,C'mon Lis. School bus.
Bart,Hi guys. What's up?
Bart,"Oh, really?"
Bart,"What? But, but yesterday didn't you say it would be cool to cut off the head and really cheese everybody off?"
Bart,You're not really talking to me. You're just my overactive imagination.
Bart,Shut up... I wanted them to like me.
Bart,To my room.
Bart,"Sorry, man. It's either you or me."
Bart,"Yeah, well I'm running a little short on courage right now."
Bart,Jebediah Obediah Zachariah Jedediah Springfield came West in 1838.
Bart,"Mom, Dad."
Bart,'Cause I wanted some really bad kids to like me. Somehow I got the idea that being popular was the most important thing in the world.
Bart,"Oh yeah, right..."
Bart,"Well, that's my story. And if you still want to tear apart this young Sunday school student as he stands on the brink of salvation, I await your wrath."
Bart,Dad?
Bart,"Forgive me, sir."
Bart,"Whoops! Whoops! Oh, whoops... whoops!"
Bart,"Hey Lis, you think that's enough for her?"
Bart,"Well, I know she'll like mine. Who wouldn't like a bottle of real French perfume?"
Bart,"All the way from Gay Paree. Four bucks, plus tax."
Bart,"Whoa, big deal... dry macaroni... spray paint and glue. Whoopee!"
Bart,"Dibs! First dibs, I get to lick the beaters."
Bart,Hep! Hep! Lisa! My ungue is stuck in the eater. Hep-hep!
Bart,You don't even know your own wife's birthday?
Bart,"Oh, right. What'd you get her, Dad?"
Bart,"You're welcome, Mom."
Bart,Does not.
Bart,Does not.
Bart,"Yeah. Hey, Mom. How come you're not putting on any of my perfume?"
Bart,What the hell are you talking about? There's gallons of it.
Bart,Gotcha. I told you she liked mine better.
Bart,My compliments to the delivery boy.
Bart,Uh-oh. School bus.
Bart,Whoa. Aye carumba!
Bart,Mmm. Wednesday -- hoagie night.
Bart,"Mmmm. Great lunches, eh, Lis?"
Bart,"Hey, don't rock the boat, man. Whatever it is, we're making out like bandits."
Bart,"No, I'm not."
Bart,"No, I'm not."
Bart,"Am not, am not, am not!"
Bart,"Hey, Dad. What do you say we toss the ol' apple around, huh? Sound like fun?"
Bart,"Aw, come on, Dad. Get the lead out."
Bart,Simpson checks the runner on first. He's cool. He's fine. Here's the windup and... here's the pitch.
Bart,"Dad, you didn't even say ouch."
Bart,"Lisa, Lisa! I think you're right about Dad. Something's very, very wrong here."
Bart,"Well, come on. We gotta do something, man."
Bart,"Look, Dad. I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some advice that might help."
Bart,"Yeah. You did! You told me when something's bothering you, and you're too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut. At least that way you won't make things worse."
Bart,"Ah, baloney."
Bart,"Yeah, right."
Bart,"Oh, gimme a break."
Bart,"Wow! Cool, man!"
Bart,"Uh oh, it's the fe-mail man."
Bart,"Lady, where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera? Where is my spy camera, lady? Where is my spy camera? Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera?"
Bart,"Oh, thanks, man. Whoa, look at the size of this thing. I wonder if it really works."
Bart,...'cause I got a lotta spyin' to do.
Bart,"Sorry, Dad. The answer to that is top secret."
Bart,What?
Bart,Aha!
Bart,Oh sure. Like I'm really gonna take a picture of my butt.
Bart,"Aw, Mom. Can't we just grab a burger and... Only four of us? Who escaped?"
Bart,"Ahoy, this place bites."
Bart,Hmmmm... let's see. This evening I shall go for the squid platter.
Bart,"Extra tentacles, please."
Bart,May I please be excused for a minute?
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,"Wow, man."
Bart,"Oh, people, people. Don't applaud. Let's get to work."
Bart,"Beats me, but the guy dancing with her is my Pop."
Bart,Sorry guys. No can do.
Bart,Will you swear not to let another living soul get a copy of this photo?
Bart,Cross your heart and hope to die?
Bart,Stick a needle in your eye?
Bart,Jam a dagger in your thigh?
Bart,Eat a horse manure pie?
Bart,"Well, okay."
Bart,"Well, okay."
Bart,"Hey, my photo!"
Bart,Uh oh.
Bart,I'm outta here.
Bart,"Welcome back, Dad."
Bart,"Yeah, good luck, man."
Bart,Oooo.
Bart,"Froggie, I'm home."
Bart,"Nice to meet you, ma'am."
Bart,"Cool, man."
Bart,Ooh! Ahh! Ooh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ohh!
Bart,Way to go dad!
Bart,"All right, folks show's over. No more to see, folks. Only sick people want to see my folks kiss."
Bart,"Hi, little fella. Got some nice juicy flies for ya."
Bart,Clumsy Homer... Everything's always my fault... If he'd just watch where he was going...
Bart,Hello.
Bart,What have we here?
Bart,A cherry bomb! I thought I blew all you guys up.
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"I am, ma'am."
Bart,"'Bye, Spanky."
Bart,What can I say? I got a weakness for the classics.
Bart,"So long, sucker."
Bart,"I'm outta here, man."
Bart,"Aah, the life of a frog. That's the life for me."
Bart,France? Wow.
Bart,"And I'd get to take a plane there, wouldn't I, Mom?"
Bart,Wow. And one back?
Bart,All the time.
Bart,I know I'm going and you're not.
Bart,"Okay, Dad."
Bart,"Yes, sir."
Bart,"Hey, man, watch it."
Bart,"Hey, man, it's me, Bart Simpson."
Bart,Hey!
Bart,"LITTLE BREEZE SEEMS TO WHISPER LOUISE / BIRDS IN THE TREES SEEM TO LOUISE / La la la la / La la la la Ooo la la... How much longer, sir?"
Bart,"This is where we're going, right?"
Bart,Cha...teau Ma...son.
Bart,"Ewww, what a dump."
Bart,"Well, okay, sir."
Bart,"Hey, come on guys. Quit being so grabby."
Bart,"Sorry, man. Be my guest."
Bart,Can I have something to go with my turnip?
Bart,"Hey! Hey! Come on. Move it, pal."
Bart,"Ugh, ugh, ugh. Stu-pid grapes... Bunch of creeps... I hate France. Ugh!"
Bart,"Yeah, right."
Bart,Sorry.
Bart,"Uh, no thanks."
Bart,"Yeah, but it's got anti-freeze in there."
Bart,"You're a policeman, aren't you?"
Bart,"But you gotta help me. These two guys I'm staying with, they work me day and night, they don't feed me, they make me sleep on the..."
Bart,"I don't want a piece of candy, I need your hel--"
Bart,"Come on, mister. Can you help me?"
Bart,"Aw, forget it. I'm so stupid. Anybody could have learned this dumb language by now. Here I've listened to nothing but French for the past deux mois, et je ne sais pas un mot. Eh! Mais, je parle francois maintenant. Incroyable!"
Bart,"Hey, monsieur. Aidez-moi! Ces deux types chez qui j'habite me fait travailler jour et nuit, ils ne me donnent pas a manger, ils me fait dormir sur la terre, ils mettent d'antigel dans le vin, et ils sont donne mon chapeau rouge a l'ane."
Bart,Mon sauveteur! Vous aurez toujours une place dans mon coeur!
Bart,"Au revoir, suckers."
Bart,"Hey, where's the big guy?"
Bart,"Hey, Homer."
Bart,"So, basically, I met one nice French person."
Bart,Same here.
Bart,My father. What a buffoon.
Bart,"You're doomed, Sideshow Bob."
Bart,"Comedy, thy name is Krusty."
Bart,"We don't expect you to, Mom."
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,"Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?"
Bart,Are you kidding? He's my idol. I've based my whole life on Krusty's teachings.
Bart,Krusty!
Bart,"Oh... oh! Krusty, how could you?"
Bart,"Thanks, Krusty."
Bart,I wish I could believe you.
Bart,Look at him. His clothes are so drab.
Bart,And his feet... they're so small.
Bart,"Say it ain't so, Krusty."
Bart,"Don't do it, Dad. Please don't do it."
Bart,"He's innocent, I tell you. Krusty would never do something like that. Ah come on Dad, you gotta listen to me."
Bart,"Oh, man."
Bart,"But Dad, you're giving in to mob mentality."
Bart,So?
Bart,"Yeah, Al. Last name, Koholic."
Bart,"What the hell are you doing, Lis?"
Bart,"You backstabber, you traitor, you..."
Bart,"Look, Lisa, I know Krusty's innocent. Don't ask me why. It's just a feeling I have."
Bart,"Come on, Lisa. I think I can prove Krusty's innocent, but I need your help."
Bart,"Oh, come on Lis, you know why."
Bart,"I'll never forgive you for making me say this, but... you're smarter than me."
Bart,"So, you with me?"
Bart,So? I don't have a pacemaker.
Bart,Ah ha!
Bart,Okay! okay! So the poor guy can't read! Can't we get off his back already?
Bart,"I don't know, but I know someone who would: Krusty's best friend in the whole world, Sideshow Bob."
Bart,"Sideshow Bob, can we ask you a few--"
Bart,"Well, okay, but..."
Bart,About a zillionth as much as I love Krusty.
Bart,"Bart Simpson, sir."
Bart,"I don't think so, sir."
Bart,"True, Sideshow Bob, but that doesn't bother me. You see, my sisters and I have been doing a little investigating, and it looks to us like Krusty was framed."
Bart,"Well, the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the Kwik-E-Mart. But Krusty couldn't go near the thing. Not with his pacemaker."
Bart,"Well, maybe. But, get this, Krusty was illiterate and the guy who robbed the store was reading the Springfield Review of Books."
Bart,"Yeah, I guess those are kinda funny."
Bart,And shot you out of a cannon.
Bart,Wait a minute! You did it!
Bart,"Attention, fellow children. Krusty didn't rob that store. Sideshow Bob framed him and I got proof."
Bart,"See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes but he's got little feet, like all good-hearted people."
Bart,Sideshow Bob really fills his shoe with big ugly feet.
Bart,"Take him away, boys."
Bart,"Yes, sir."
Bart,Hey! Donuts!
Bart,Awww... Homer!
Bart,"Hey, cool your jets, man. We're comin'!"
Bart,"That's okay, Mom!"
Bart,"Aw, where's your sense of humor?"
Bart,"Hello, is Al there?"
Bart,"Yeah, who'd possibly be late on meat loaf night?"
Bart,How 'bout some grub?
Bart,A little pre-dinner entertainment...
Bart,Is Oliver there?
Bart,Oliver Klozoff.
Bart,"Work that body, Homer."
Bart,Not if I can help it.
Bart,"You don't have a clue, do you, Dad?"
Bart,What a grump.
Bart,"Aye-aye, Mambo Man."
Bart,"Oh, the Elves, the Elves!"
Bart,"Look, lady, we've seen the Crappy Little Elves about fourteen billion times. Maybe we can watch some real TV."
Bart,"Awww, that's merely suggested viewing matter, lady. Mom lets us watch whatever the hell we want."
Bart,"Oh, man, I can't take it anymore."
Bart,"You know what happens. They find Captain Kook's treasure, all the elves dance around like little green idiots, I puke, the end."
Bart,Now for some real TV.
Bart,"All right! ""America's Most Armed and Dangerous."""
Bart,"Relax. This is cinema verite. When the brutal slow-motion killing starts, I'll tell you to shut your eyes."
Bart,Wow.
Bart,RUN FOR IT!
Bart,Go ahead. Take 'em all.
Bart,The thing is no one was hurt. I think it would be really silly to dwell on this.
Bart,"We know who you are, Ms. Botz. Or should I say, Ms. Botzucowski. You're the Babysitter Bandit."
Bart,"You're crazy if you think you're gonna get away with this, lady. You can't --"
Bart,Ask if there's a reward!
Bart,Yeah!
Bart,"This way to the scene of the crime, men. I've got her tied up in the den."
Bart,"Awww, Homer."
Bart,"Little ketchup for your buns, Papa?"
Bart,"Is it ready? Ha, what a question. Fellow students, prepare to be dazzled. Well, as Mrs. Krabappel already mentioned, the name of the book that I read was ""Treasure Island""."
Bart,It's about these pirates. Pirates with patches over their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... and green birds on their shoulders...
Bart,Did I mention this book was written by a guy named Robert Louis Stevenson? And published by the good people at McGraw Hill.
Bart,"So in conclusion, on the Simpsons' scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, one being the lowest, and five being average, I give this book... a nine."
Bart,Any questions?
Bart,No? Then I'll just sit down.
Bart,"Mrs. Krabappel, I am insulted. Is this a book report or a witch hunt?"
Bart,Bluebeard?
Bart,"Yes, ma'am."
Bart,"Yes, ma'am."
Bart,"Yes, ma'am."
Bart,"Yes, ma'am."
Bart,"Yes, ma'am."
Bart,Uhhh... straighten up and fly right?
Bart,"Whoa, take that, Granny! Oh, hide in the closet. Oh no, deadly mothballs."
Bart,Ooo... Granny killing me!
Bart,Heh... heh... heh. Just a couple more games and I'll hit the books.
Bart,"Okay, right after dinner, it's down to business."
Bart,What's the big idea? You covered up my paper.
Bart,"No, Dad, I should really... Whoop!"
Bart,"Ah well, maybe just one more hour."
Bart,"Well, time to hit the books."
Bart,"All right, okay, let's take care of some business. ""Chapter One: A Dream of Freedom. On September fifteenth, sixteen-twenty, Puritan separatists from the Church of England, some living in Holland, left Plymouth, England. Their destination was --"
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Hey, Otto-man. I've got a big test that I am not ready for. Could you please crash the bus or something?"
Bart,"Okay, no reason to panic. Find an egghead, pump him for some answers, and boom, I'm back on easy street."
Bart,"Good morning, girls."
Bart,Say... who's up for a little cram session? I'll go first. What was the name of the pilgrim's boat?
Bart,And where did they land?
Bart,Why'd they leave England?
Bart,Cool. History's coming alive.
Bart,So you're saying...
Bart,Thanks for the pep talk.
Bart,Oh! Ooooo!!
Bart,Nothing... must... take... test.
Bart,Ooooo!!
Bart,"Sharp, stabbing pains... in my stomach."
Bart,"Both arms, ma'am."
Bart,Who said that? Come closer.
Bart,"Uh maybe... uh, one more dish. Make it double cappuccino chocolate fudge."
Bart,"Hmmm, perhaps the TV?"
Bart,"Well, everyone better keep their mouths shut."
Bart,I've got my bases covered.
Bart,"Hey Milhouse, what did I miss in school today?"
Bart,"Oh, you don't say? What about that history test?... Huh? Piece of cake, huh? So listen, what'd you get for Number one? Uh huh. Number two?... Oh yeah, that sounds right."
Bart,"Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
Bart,No.
Bart,I dunno.
Bart,Okay... okay! Why are we dancing around the obvious? I know it. You know it. I am dumb. Okay? Dumb as a post. Do you think I'm happy about it?
Bart,"What! You can't hold me back. I'll do better, I promise."
Bart,"No, I mean it. You can't hold me back. I swear I'm gonna do better. Look at my eyes. See the sincerity, see the conviction, see the fear. As God is my witness, I can pass the fourth grade."
Bart,"Otto, you know I respect you. I mean you always let us throw stuff at cars and try to tip the bus on sharp turns..."
Bart,"Well, I've been failing a lot of tests recently."
Bart,And now they're talking about holding me back in the fourth grade if I don't shape up.
Bart,"Look, lady. I got a peptic ulcer, a wife hocking me for a new car, and I need a root canal. Will you quit bugging me about this stupid pirate."
Bart,"Thanks a lot, son."
Bart,Yo! Little help!
Bart,"I said little help! Throw me the ball, Poindexter."
Bart,"Hm, hey, Martin."
Bart,I need you to help me get a passing grade.
Bart,Because I can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you so much.
Bart,You're not. Watch!
Bart,Perhaps another demonstration.
Bart,Then it's a deal.
Bart,Study area?
Bart,"Well, there's a desk under that junk over there."
Bart,No.
Bart,"Only geeks sit in the front seat. From now on you sit in the back row. And that's not just on the bus. It goes for school and church, too."
Bart,So no one can see what you're doing.
Bart,"Well yeah, but don't say it like that."
Bart,"Great, Martin. Now, the big test is tomorrow and I haven't even started to study..."
Bart,Hey! I thought we had a deal.
Bart,Okay.
Bart,This is hopeless.
Bart,"Well, old timer... I guess this is the end of the road. I know I haven't always been a good kid. But if I have to go to school tomorrow, I'll fail the test and be held back. I just need one more day to study, Lord. I need your help."
Bart,"A teacher's strike, a power failure, a blizzard. Anything that'll cancel school tomorrow. I know it's asking a lot, but if anyone can do it, you can. Thanking you in advance, your pal, Bart Simpson."
Bart,"Oh? No, no."
Bart,"Huh? Whoa, Good morning, world!"
Bart,Please please please please please please please. All right!
Bart,owabunga!
Bart,Hey.
Bart,"You're right. I asked for a miracle and I got it. I gotta study, man."
Bart,"I'm not missin'anything. Frozen earlobes, trudging up that stupid sled hill over and over again... how good could it be?"
Bart,We hold these truths to be self-evident. We hold these truths to be self-evident.
Bart,That all men are created equal.
Bart,"Do you want to be held back a grade? Concentrate, man."
Bart,"Do you think you could grade it now, please?"
Bart,"Oh no, I can't believe it."
Bart,"No, you don't understand. I really tried this time. I really tried."
Bart,This is as good as I can do. And I still failed.
Bart,"Who am I kidding? I really am a failure. Oh, now I know how George Washington felt when he surrendered Fort Necessity to the French in 1754..."
Bart,"Oh you know... 1754, the famous defeat to the French..."
Bart,So...
Bart,You mean I passed?
Bart,I passed. I got a D minus. I passed. All right!
Bart,"I passed! I passed! I passed! I passed! I got a D minus. I passed!... I got a D minus. I passed!... I got a D minus. I passed! I passed! I kissed the teacher. Peh, peh, peh peh."
Bart,"Thanks, Dad. But part of this D minus belongs to God."
Bart,Hitler?
Bart,It is.
Bart,Mom and Dad have been smooching again.
Bart,Whoa...
Bart,"Hey, what's happenin', hip cats?"
Bart,"It's like, realsville, Daddy-o."
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"I love you, Dad."
Bart,Yawn. I heard that when I was in the third grade. It's not scary.
Bart,Is not.
Bart,Is not.
Bart,Is not.
Bart,"Flashlight, please."
Bart,Here's a story that's really scarifying.
Bart,"I call it ""Bad Dream House."""
Bart,Did not.
Bart,Did not.
Bart,Mom! Dad! Help!
Bart,Are you my conscience?
Bart,"Man, this place has got everything!"
Bart,Do you get HBO?
Bart,Do it again.
Bart,Make the walls bleed.
Bart,"Hey, man. We own you. Let's see some blood."
Bart,"Come on man, do it! Do the blood thing! Come on, do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!"
Bart,Bitchin'!
Bart,"Oh, yeah? Well how about... this severed finger!"
Bart,"Eww, baby spit."
Bart,"Well that last story was just a warm-up for this macabre tale, which I call, ""Hungry Are The Damned."""
Bart,Cool man!
Bart,"Well, what are you gonna do with us, man?"
Bart,Sloppy Joes!
Bart,"Hey, that's just Pong!"
Bart,"Get with the times, man."
Bart,"Way to go, Lis."
Bart,"Hello, something scary happening."
Bart,"Hey, Poindexter. It's Halloween, put the book away."
Bart,Wait a minute. That's a schoolbook.
Bart,Are we scared yet?
Bart,This better be good.
Bart,You know what would have been scarier than nothing?
Bart,Anything!
Bart,Eat my shorts!
Bart,"Okay, okay."
Bart,Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore.
Bart,"Lisa, that wasn't scary. Not even for a poem."
Bart,"Well yeah, like when you look at ""Friday The 13th, Part I,"" it's pretty tame by today's standards."
Bart,I guess I'll have no trouble gettin' to sleep tonight.
Bart,I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Bart,"Well, this is my day and we do, sir."
Bart,All right! We eat tonight!
Bart,"Keep those mutants comin', Homer."
Bart,Is your boss Governor yet?
Bart,Cool man! A media circus.
Bart,Uh oh.
Bart,Whoa! He's here!
Bart,"Dear God, we paid for all this stuff ourselves, so thanks for nothin'."
Bart,All right! Three eyed fish!
Bart,"Uh oh. You're busted, Dad."
Bart,What? Aren't we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers?
Bart,"Oh, wow -- there's Flash Bailor! I gotta get his autograph! He used to be a star!"
Bart,"Hey, Flash! Will ya sign my ball?"
Bart,"Lousy, washed-up, broken-down... old tub of guts... who does he think he is anyway..."
Bart,He wouldn't sign my ball.
Bart,"""Hmmm, Springfield Kozy Kort Motel, Room 26... How 'bout it? -- Flash."""
Bart,"Hey, Dad, look, you're on JumboVision!"
Bart,What a lame-o!
Bart,"You throw like my sister, man!"
Bart,We want a pitcher / Not a belly itcher!
Bart,"Oh, oh. Hey, cool, man."
Bart,"Well, what am I supposed to do about friends?"
Bart,"Yeah, let's blow this pop stand and never look back."
Bart,"Come on, Milhouse. This way we'll be friends forever."
Bart,"I'm gonna miss you, spit brother."
Bart,Wow!
Bart,These seats stink!
Bart,What's with these people? Why are they sitting on their hands?
Bart,"Well, I guess it's back to good old Springfield."
Bart,"You heard the lady, Homer. So please mow quietly. Genius at work."
Bart,"One o'clock -- still just a potato.,one oclock -- still just a potato,7
5433,19,6,Ned Flanders: (PLEASANTLY) Hey there"
Bart,"Play it where it lays, Homer."
Bart,What a sap!
Bart,Bosom!
Bart,Huh?
Bart,All right!
Bart,"Heh, heh, heh heh..."
Bart,"Give up, Homeboy. There's a six-stroke limit."
Bart,Get bent.
Bart,"Final score: Bart, forty-one. Homer... let's see, six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six..."
Bart,Wow! Free balloons for everyone who enters!
Bart,I guess it's possible.
Bart,"But Dad, I've never won anything in my life."
Bart,"Oh, man."
Bart,What?
Bart,Mr. Putter.
Bart,Mom.
Bart,Why?
Bart,Who's Charlene?
Bart,"Lis, what do you call those guys in chess that don't matter?"
Bart,Absolutely. Eeeeeeeer!
Bart,Right. I am a pawn.
Bart,"Lisa, we can't afford all these books."
Bart,"Oh, heh, heh. Gotcha."
Bart,Okay.
Bart,You got it.
Bart,Done.
Bart,True.
Bart,I'll bet.
Bart,Piece of cake.
Bart,"No answer? Lisa, listen up."
Bart,Woooooooo!
Bart,I can't believe it... You've actually found a practical use for geometry.
Bart,"Okay, I'll try."
Bart,Aim for the Octopus' third tentacle.
Bart,Bank it off the pink tombstone.
Bart,A state of bliss attained through the extinction of the self.
Bart,"Mom, do I have to?"
Bart,"Thanks, man!"
Bart,"Oh, man..."
Bart,Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in...
Bart,"This is pretty tense, isn't it, Todd?"
Bart,Who wants to build character. Let's quit.
Bart,"We want to call it a draw, man."
Bart,"Put her there, man!"
Bart,She took my glue!
Bart,Oh yeah? Prove it!
Bart,"Hey, man, I don't want your stupid glue."
Bart,Who the hell is that?
Bart,"Who? Wait a minute, who's that?"
Bart,"Well, I know it wouldn't hurt 'em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years."
Bart,"Can't I help you, Mom?"
Bart,Yeah! Where is it?
Bart,Here?
Bart,Got it. Now what?
Bart,No problemo. Where's the can opener?
Bart,"Oh, I got ya."
Bart,"It's broken, Mom. Mom, it's broken. Mom, it's broken. Mom, it's broken. Mom, it's broken. Mom, it's broken."
Bart,"Ah, cranberry sauce à la Bart."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,Da da daah da da dah daaahhh...
Bart,Yikes! What is that?
Bart,"Well, it's taking up valuable real estate."
Bart,"Move it or lose it, toots!"
Bart,Bitchin'!
Bart,"Okay. I'll take some white meat and stuffing to go... and, send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes."
Bart,I didn't ruin Thanksgiving! She did... Buncha jerks... I always get blamed for everything...
Bart,Apologize! For what?! Clearing the table? Having a sense of humor? They think they can starve an apology out of me. Ha!
Bart,"Uh-oh!... I mean, good!"
Bart,"Hey boy, come here! You're a good dog! Come on, we don't need them to get a Thanksgiving dinner!"
Bart,Wow! Swan-ky!
Bart,"Mmmm. Stay here, boy."
Bart,Uh-oh!
Bart,"Don't worry, boy. We'll get some grub. Even if we have to pay for it."
Bart,Cool! The wrong side of the tracks.
Bart,"Twelve bucks! Hey, I can bleed!"
Bart,"Here you go, doll face."
Bart,Ow.
Bart,Twelve bucks and a free cookie... what a country!
Bart,"All right. Twelve big ones and free grub to boot. Viva skid row. Hey, it's that anchor dude from channel six."
Bart,"Goin' on five years, Kent."
Bart,"Yes, there is, Kent. Ha! Ha! I didn't apologize!"
Bart,"Yeah, there's this family I kind of hang out with."
Bart,"Yeah, I guess it is."
Bart,"A...listen, guys I was thinking, uh... unless you'd feel weird about taking money from a kid...I thought maybe..."
Bart,"Best Thanksgiving ever, eh boy?"
Bart,Hmmm... should I... or shouldn't I...
Bart,"Hey, everybody. I'm home."
Bart,"Okay. I'm sorry, too."
Bart,"Lisa, I beg of you. Please forgive me."
Bart,I'm sorry.
Bart,I'm sorry.
Bart,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Bart,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
Bart,I'm sorry all right! Sorry I came back here!
Bart,Aha.
Bart,Whoa!!
Bart,"My wiffle balls, my frisbees, my water rockets... I've hit the jackpot!"
Bart,"A sellout crowd at the Super Bowl, Simpson down by six with two seconds left! Simpson fades back. He's got Simpson in the open..."
Bart,"Touchdown, Simpson! The boy nobody wanted just won the Superbowl!!!"
Bart,"Hey, Lis! Lisa! It's me, Bart!"
Bart,Shh! I'm on the roof!
Bart,Really? Did they cry?
Bart,Bulls-eye!
Bart,"Ah, come on..."
Bart,I don't know! I don't know why I did it! I don't know why I enjoyed it! And I don't know why I'll do it again!
Bart,Why should I?
Bart,Leave me alone!
Bart,Okay... okay.
Bart,"Hmmm, hmmm. Looking for the spot... Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm... Still checking. This is so stupid... I'm not gonna find anything... Just because I wrecked something she worked really hard on and I made her cr... Uh-oh!"
Bart,"I'm sorry, Lisa."
Bart,"Two titans at the height of their careers. Ah, if you ask me, this is going to be one hell of a match."
Bart,"Hey, Milhouse, crank it up."
Bart,"Correction, was your seat."
Bart,But Truckasaurous is one night only!
Bart,"Faster, Dad. Truckasaurous awaits."
Bart,Truckasaurous!
Bart,"Pull, pull you dogs."
Bart,"Gimme some nachos, Homersaurous."
Bart,This is so cool.
Bart,He made it!
Bart,Bitchin'!
Bart,"Dad, I want to be a daredevil."
Bart,"Spare me your lectures, ladies."
Bart,Oof!
Bart,"Better than all right, I got stitches."
Bart,"Probably a scar, too."
Bart,"Hey, Otto! Can I use that microphone?"
Bart,"He certainly has, Dad. I learned a real lesson here today. Thank you. Dr. Hibbert."
Bart,I did it!
Bart,Thank you. How 'bout a hand for these brave little animals?
Bart,"I'm runnin' on empty, Milhouse. You kids get a kick out of my jumps, and I love you for it, but it's all too easy."
Bart,There's got to be a challenge out there worthy of me.
Bart,Wow!!
Bart,"Otto, I'm gonna leap over Springfield Gorge on my skateboard."
Bart,What?
Bart,But I want to tell them about my jump.
Bart,"May I have you attention, please. This Saturday I will be jumping over Springfield Gorge on my skateboard. There is a good possibility I will plunge to my bloody death. Hope to see you there, thank you."
Bart,"Lisa, I don't know how to explain this, but I get the same thrill out of jumping over stuff that you do from... reading."
Bart,"It's an honor, Lance. How you feeling?"
Bart,"Just Bart will be fine, sir."
Bart,"Wow, man! Thanks, Lance."
Bart,What's the matter?
Bart,Why?
Bart,"Thanks, Lance."
Bart,Squealer.
Bart,"Bart, I forbid you to jump over that gorge."
Bart,You can't.
Bart,"Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but there's no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and headin' for that gorge."
Bart,"Ah, nothing."
Bart,Maybe.
Bart,"Okay, I promise."
Bart,"Aw, come on."
Bart,"Well, okay, Dad. I promise. I will not jump Springfield Gorge."
Bart,"Hey, what gives?"
Bart,What? Why?
Bart,"But, Dad, you'll never make it."
Bart,"Wait, dad. Don't do it. I won't jump anymore, I promise."
Bart,"I love you, Dad."
Bart,"Hey, down in front!"
Bart,"Hey, Dad. Can you move your head?"
Bart,Really? What kind of robots?
Bart,"Thanks, Nelson."
Bart,Hey... That's just crazy enough to work.
Bart,That reminds me. I've gotta get over to Milhouse's and... uh... play sports.
Bart,"Oh, oh, baby!"
Bart,"After dinner, can I watch cartoons?"
Bart,"Oop, I guess I'll just go and watch some cartoons."
Bart,"Hey, who's up for some cartoons?"
Bart,All right.
Bart,Me and the guys went fishing. Almost caught a catfish this big.
Bart,Borrowed?
Bart,"You mean we can watch cartoons again, Mom?"
Bart,Turn it up!
Bart,I think it sucks.
Bart,"Nah. Come on, Lis."
Bart,"Come on, Lis. Let's go finish our soapbox racers."
Bart,"Hey, cool. I'm dead."
Bart,Great Grandpa Simpson!
Bart,Snowball!
Bart,I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Bart,"Hey, I'm innocent, man!"
Bart,Um... say... is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here?
Bart,"Oh, okay. See you later then."
Bart,Yessir!
Bart,"I did go away, Mom! I was miles and miles and miles away, writhing in agony in the pits of Hell. And you were there! And you! And you! And you! You I've never seen before."
Bart,Ow! Quit it!
Bart,Ow! Quit it!
Bart,Am I gonna die?
Bart,Will I ever play baseball again?
Bart,But I played baseball this morning!
Bart,Fine.
Bart,I am in constant pain.
Bart,"Ah, you mean like I'm dead? Yeah, sure."
Bart,Maybe.
Bart,No.
Bart,"Yes, sir. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon. I was playing in my wholesome childlike way, little realizing that I was about to be struck down by the Luxury Car of Death."
Bart,"Luckily, I was not killed that day. Although sometimes I wish I had been."
Bart,You know what would've really been cool? If we got that million bucks.
Bart,"What? We could have bought tons of great stuff, Mom... maids, a pool, fancy sweaters... stop me if I'm wrong."
Bart,"Sushi? Hey, maybe this is just one of those things you hear on the playground... but, isn't that raw fish?"
Bart,"Akira, my good man, I'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel."
Bart,Do you have any giant squid? The kind that drags men to their deaths?
Bart,WHO'S THE BLACK PRIVATE DICK THAT'S THE SEX MACHINE TO ALL THE CHICKS?
Bart,You're damn right. WHO'S THE CAT THAT WON'T COP OUT / WHEN THERE'S DANGER ALL ABOUT?
Bart,Right on.
Bart,THEY SAY THIS CAT SHAFT IS A BAD MOTHER...
Bart,But I'm talkin' about Shaft.
Bart,HE'S A COMPLICATED MAN BUT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HIM BUT HIS WOMAN.
Bart,"Oh, man."
Bart,Oh.
Bart,"Oh, come on, I do plenty around here! Lisa never lifts a finger. Why don't you go yell at her?"
Bart,"Hey, this is good stuff."
Bart,It was like that when I got here.
Bart,Why are we all dressed up?
Bart,What's with the candles?
Bart,Why are we really waiting for Dad?
Bart,"Is Seymour there? Last name, Butts."
Bart,"Oh, it will not."
Bart,"Hey, what gives?"
Bart,"Looks like you lost the patient, Doc."
Bart,"Hey, everybody! If you look real close, you can kinda make 'em out."
Bart,You lie!
Bart,I'm livin' it but I ain't lovin' it.
Bart,"It was a jailhouse romance, man."
Bart,Aye Carumba!
Bart,"Great story. Positively spellbinding. Work, damn you, work!"
Bart,"Get off the edge of your seat. They got married, had kids and bought a cheap TV. Okay?"
Bart,"Wouldn't you eventually get used to it, like in a hot tub?"
Bart,Cool. This is where Jaws eats the boat.
Bart,Cool. This is where Die Hard jumps through the window.
Bart,Cool. This is where Wall Street gets arrested.
Bart,"All right. I've sat through mercy and I've sat through forgiveness. Finally, we get to the good stuff."
Bart,"Oh, Miss Albright."
Bart,Are there pirates in hell?
Bart,Hell.
Bart,"Well, that's what we learned about. I sure as hell can't tell you we learned about hell unless I say hell, can I?"
Bart,"Hell, yes."
Bart,"Hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell."
Bart,"Hey, anybody up for a little so-called pay TV?"
Bart,Beats the hell out of me.
Bart,Ehhhh!
Bart,Aye Carumba!
Bart,Dad!
Bart,"Oh, here's what I was looking for."
Bart,Okay.
Bart,I promise I will never watch that channel again.
Bart,"Come one, come all, Top Hat Theatre is on the air. The most beautiful women in the world. Just fifty-cents. I am your host, Bart Simpson. You must be at least eight years old to enter."
Bart,"Well, back to the fight."
Bart,"Man, I wish I was an adult so I could break the rules."
Bart,"Oh, okay."
Bart,"Dad, I beg you to reconsider. Tractor pulls, Atlanta Braves baseball, Joe Franklin..."
Bart,What's this stuff for?
Bart,What's a herbicide?
Bart,Excellent.
Bart,"Vandalism fans, hold on to your hats!"
Bart,"Maybe it was one of the other Barts, Sir."
Bart,Uh-oh.
Bart,"Hello, is Homer there?"
Bart,Homer Sexual.
Bart,"Good evening, Principal Skinner and welcome to our home."
Bart,Fine. Now just get inside already.
Bart,Stupid - Principal - Skinner. No - sense - of - humor.
Bart,"Cherry cordials, sir."
Bart,Have I ever. Just the thought of doing anything bad again makes my stomach turn.
Bart,"Well, Willie, you can take it from here. Adios, dude."
Bart,Skinner? He works for me now.
Bart,Uh oh.
Bart,"Your funeral, Seymour."
Bart,Seymour?
Bart,Okay.
Bart,Principal Skinner is going to ask Aunt Patty to marry him.
Bart,How do you know unless you opened your eyes during the blessing?
Bart,Is not.
Bart,Is not.
Bart,Is not.
Bart,Not one word.
Bart,"So, any idea where this bastard lives?"
Bart,"Well his parents aren't married, are they? It's the correct word, isn't it?"
Bart,"BASTARD, BASTARD / BASTARD, BASTARD / BASTARD, BASTARD"
Bart,"BASTARD / BASTARD, BASTARD!"
Bart,"Hello, sir."
Bart,"I'm the little hell-raiser, sir."
Bart,"He sure does, Uncle Herb."
Bart,"No problemo, Unky Herb."
Bart,Polo!
Bart,Polo!
Bart,"Unky Herb, can I spit over the side?"
Bart,"Ohh, oh, got him."
Bart,"I want to go on a boat ride, Unky Herb."
Bart,Boat ride!
Bart,Boat ride!
Bart,"Ahoy, Mateys!"
Bart,"Batting nine. Unky, Herbbbb!"
Bart,"Bye, Unky Herb."
Bart,They hate each other.
Bart,Dad?
Bart,I thought your car was really cool.
Bart,"No way! She's faking! If Lisa stays home, I stay home."
Bart,Fine. Then...
Bart,"Wait a minute. If Lisa goes to school then I go to school, but then Lisa stays home so I stay home, so Lisa goes to school..."
Bart,"Homework? Lisa, you wasted chicken pox. Don't waste the mumps."
Bart,"Hey, Otto-man."
Bart,"Go home, boy! Go... home!"
Bart,Here's your stupid homework.
Bart,Whoa! Assassins!
Bart,They better be for a hundred and twenty-five big ones!
Bart,"Oh school! Right. Yeah, that's your answer for everything!"
Bart,Santa's Little Helper.
Bart,"Is my dog dead, ma'am?"
Bart,"Like a hose, your wrinkled highness."
Bart,"Miss Winthrop, I was thinking..."
Bart,We never had a family meeting before.
Bart,No way! You can't give my dog away! I'll set fire to my hair! I'll rip up all my clothes! I'll put sugar in the gas tank!
Bart,"All right, all right. If Santa's Little Helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog, can we keep him then?"
Bart,Dad!
Bart,"...since you get paid either way, would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass?"
Bart,All right!
Bart,"See boy, it's not so hard. Here, roll over... roll over... like this."
Bart,"Oh, thank you, you moldy old maid."
Bart,"Now, sit! I said sit!"
Bart,Uh... Take a walk!
Bart,"Sniff that other dog's butt! See, he does exactly what I tell him."
Bart,Stay boy! Stay! Stay! Stayyy!!
Bart,Yeah!
Bart,"He'll sit, he'll sit. Come on, boy. Sit! Sit!"
Bart,Huh?
Bart,I don't want to strangle my dog.
Bart,"I'm sorry, boy. You can't help being dumb."
Bart,"Come on, boy, sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Oh, man!"
Bart,"I'm gonna miss you, boy."
Bart,"I thought we were gonna be pals forever. But, we're gonna have to say goodbye, because you don't understand a single word I say. If you just knew how important it was to learn sit..."
Bart,Wait a minute! You did it!
Bart,... lay down...
Bart,... shake hands?... stay!
Bart,... speak!
Bart,All right! Good boy! Roll over!
Bart,'Bye.
Bart,"You know, Grampa kinda smells like that trunk in the garage where the bottom's all wet."
Bart,Well...
Bart,Bo-ring.
Bart,The Museum of Barnyard Oddities.
Bart,"Hey, didn't anybody notice this place sucks?"
Bart,"No way, José."
Bart,Nunchucks.
Bart,Grampa!
Bart,Choose your corncob! En garde!
Bart,"Give it to us, Grampa."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"Let's see, I want a teargas can, a blue gun with paralyzer darts..."
Bart,A copy of Radioactive Man number 27. That's the first time he fights Dr. Crab. Then I wanna buy that baseball card where the guy is flippin' the bird.
Bart,Oh and the
Bart,"It has been a great week, hasn't it, Lis?"
Bart,"Hey, it worked on me."
Bart,Yeah.
Bart,"Thanks, Dad."
Bart,C'mon Homer. Get the lead out!
Bart,All right! No line!
Bart,Aye carumba!
Bart,"Okay, Lis. Turn on the waterworks, babe."
Bart,"Step aside. Come on. Spread out, spread out. Lost kid. Comin' through. Look out, fatso. Comin' through. Comin' through. Pardon me. Movin' to the front of the line. Hey, Lis, nice work, babe."
Bart,Bitchin'.
Bart,Okay.
Bart,"Hey, Homer, I found your weights."
Bart,"Hey, who's the moptop with the big schnozz?"
Bart,"The Heavy Hands don't work unless you move, Homer."
Bart,Oh really.
Bart,You look mahvelous.
Bart,"Hey, Mom. Did he have those spots all over his body?"
Bart,Oops.
Bart,More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos!
Bart,And here comes Snowball II. This is the one we kept.
Bart,"We were going to keep the gray one, but the mother ate her."
Bart,"Oh look, this is really cool. When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in."
Bart,I had a speech ready... but my dog ate it!
Bart,"Why, Mrs. Krabappel! How would I know where the principal's office is?"
Bart,Waaaaaaaah!
Bart,That's not enough! We demand more asbestos! More Asbestos!
Bart,"Aw, Dad. It's just a popularity contest."
Bart,"Sure, why not?"
Bart,"Hm, yeah."
Bart,"He says, there aren't any easy answers! I say, he's not looking hard enough!"
Bart,"Me, too, Mom. I think they're drifting apart."
Bart,"Yeah, listen to my tail."
Bart,"No, you're the tail!"
Bart,"Hey, that actually feels good!"
Bart,Li-sa! Meet your new husband!
Bart,"I miss you, Dad."
Bart,No snake tattoo.
Bart,When will I find the man who murdered my parents? When?
Bart,"No villain is safe from me, Serpent!"
Bart,Explain that to your maker!
Bart,"Party's over, Serpent!"
Bart,You! You're the man who killed my parents!
Bart,I did it. I finally got my revenge.
Bart,Well... I do feel a little better. Plus I've got zillions of dollars and no parents to tell me what to do.
Bart,Don't talk to me when I'm vibrating.
Bart,"Hey Homer, you wanna eat my shorts?"
Bart,S'allright.
Bart,S'allright.
Bart,S'allright.
Bart,"Hmmmm, lobotomy..."
Bart,"Well, at least it's a beautiful night."
Bart,How could this go wrong?
Bart,Please kill me!
Bart,Every moment I live is agony!
Bart,Good ol' rock. Nothing beats that.
Bart,"Well, it looks like it's just you and me, Barty Boy."
Bart,It's gotta be a trick. Run like the wind.
Bart,Oh my God! My sister's my best friend.
Bart,He's buying it!
Bart,Oh my God! It's just like Dad's!
Bart,She's beautiful. Say somethin' clever.
Bart,Now just relax. For once you didn't do anything wrong. Just explain yourself and everyone will understand.
Bart,They love me. I'm accepted. I don't need this mask anymore.
Bart,That doesn't sound like me. Could it be the drug kicking in? I am feeling an urge to straighten up and fly right...
Bart,This test is boring. What else is on?
Bart,Time to get rid of the competition.
Bart,"Oh man, I must be the first guy who was ever pressured into marriage."
Bart,"She had more curves than a Hot Wheels track. Well, she didn't yet, but she would after puberty."
Bart,Gotta stop that letter!
Bart,"Okay, this is it. Do or die."
Bart,A girl who likes candy? Wow.
Bart,"Wake up, Dad."
Bart,Never kill a bird. Never kill a bird.
Bart,Blackbeard... Captain Nemo... Captain Hook... Long John Silver... Peg Leg Pete... Bluebeard.
Bart,"Yo, Homer! Can you take me to when you were ten to see if I can kick your butt?"
Bart,Uh... Apu.
Bart,"Hey Milhouse, did I ever tell you about the catch I made when I was ten? Greatest moment of my life..."
Bart,A fake? Then I did suck! I do suck!
Bart,I knew it! I rule! And you drool!
Bart,"Take a picture, it'll last longer, man."
Bart,"Don't have a cow, man."
Bart,Ay carumba!
Bart,"Speakin' of cracks, pull up your pants, dude."
Bart,"Why don't you fetch it yourself, man."
Bart,"Marriage, shmarriage. What's in the box, man?"
Bart,"Still smells better than your gym socks, man."
Bart,Could you please stop fighting in front of us?
Bart,"Jenda, I think we're ready to go all the way."
Bart,"Jenda, that's not what I meant."
Bart,I love you. Will you marry me?
Bart,"I've got it all figured out! You can waitress while I learn to cut meat. We'll live in a trailer, but to avoid paying for parking, I'll drive while you sleep. We'll never, ever stop!"
Bart,When?
Bart,So that's how Jenda dumped me.
Bart,"No, Mom dumped you 'cause you blew all our money on this underwater house."
Bart,So... what do you do to kill time in here?
Bart,Why'd you buy the first hover car ever made? Didn't you know it'd take time to work out the kinks?
Bart,"Dad, that's my fourth grade teacher!"
Bart,"Hi, Mrs. K. This is sure weird, huh?"
Bart,"Uh, I... don't think so."
Bart,"I wish I could talk to my fourth grade self just once. I'd say ""work hard, don't be such a screw up."""
Bart,This time is so precious -- don't waste it!
Bart,No. He activated his self-destruct mechanism.
Bart,Love can really be painful.
Bart,How'd he take it?
Bart,I guess everyone in this family is doomed to wind up alone.
Bart,"A career? No problem, I speak three languages."
Bart,Oh yeah?
Bart,"When Jenda hears about my great new career, she'll definitely take me back."
Bart,"Yes, Mr. Gheet."
Bart,"Which one? Radioactive, smallpox, eternal midnight..."
Bart,"Oh, I get it. You can't tip me because your hands are tied. My Dad pulls that scam all the time."
Bart,Uh... with the diamond?
Bart,I can't take your scholarship! It's going to my sister. It would break her heart.
Bart,They do?
Bart,Mr. Smithers? I thought you were... you know... a...
Bart,"Listen, Lis, I've gotta tell you something. I'm going to Yale."
Bart,Then I've got some great news! You're not going to Yale!
Bart,What?
Bart,Why don't you mail it to your butt?
Bart,"Hey, Nelson. What's up with your girlfriends?"
Bart,I'd better go talk to him.
Bart,"Cheer up, Milhouse. You got your whole life ahead of you."
Bart,"Hey, I remember when you were a nerdy little fourth-grader. And now you're an emotionally crippled mini-Hulk. What girl wouldn't want that?"
Bart,I guess so.
Bart,"Oh, I was just thinking about Milhouse and Lisa."
Bart,"Hey, that rundown old house looks familiar! That's where Doc Frink used to live!"
Bart,This machine lets us look into the future. Wouldn't that be romantic?
Bart,Totally. Right after I fiddle with these dials and levers.
Bart,I can't let that happen. I gotta go.
Bart,Nooooo!!!!!
Bart,Keeping Lisa from destroying her life!
Bart,"Look, I'm not taking the scholarship. You're the one who deserves to go to Yale."
Bart,"Hey, I'm waiting 'til I find a girl who likes me for me."
Bart,Sparkle sparkle!
Bart,"Dad, the earring could plug the hole."
Homer,I've gotta get back to work.
Homer,Underprivileged? You pretended we were poor just to get me into camp?
Homer,"Wow, a Negro!"
Homer,So cool.
Homer,I can't wait to meet the girls!
Homer,I got it!
Homer,"Ooo la la, a girl with teeth. Me like!"
Homer,That's 'cause I've eaten sixteen pieces of pie.
Homer,"You know, doing dishes has been the best part of camp."
Homer,Because I talked to you.
Homer,I couldn't see her through the flaps. But she's my kinda girl...
Homer,"To me they were the rubbery gates of heaven, because behind them was the girl of my dreams."
Homer,"Well, I can ask if she has any friends, 'cause she wants to meet me tonight."
Homer,"Ooh, a switchblade. I see the switch, but where's the blade?"
Homer,Found it.
Homer,An eye patch? But I've got a date tonight!
Homer,"All right, how should I get there?"
Homer,"Hm, I guess it's row versus wade. And it's my right to choose."
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,I got it!
Homer,Hi.
Homer,"Elvis? What the Hell kind of name is... oh yeah, right."
Homer,Uhhhh... Ummmm...
Homer,Absolutely. Or my name isn't... whatever I told you it was.
Homer,I found this stone earlier. I was gonna use it as a nerd-smasher... but I want you to have it.
Homer,"Hey, you're right. Give it back! No, I still want you to have it. But every time you smash a nerd with it, think of me."
Homer,"What a kiss. If I died now, I'd die happy."
Homer,"...ooh, what a view..."
Homer,"Good ol' patch, you saved my life!"
Homer,What the? Fat camp?
Homer,I don't belong here!
Homer,"I've gotta go, I've got a date!"
Homer,Somewhere out there she's waiting for me.
Homer,Now's my chance.
Homer,Love... conquers... all.
Homer,Snake!
Homer,You're superior to me in every way!
Homer,"Buenos dias, Eduardo. Can you write back and tell me what that means?"
Homer,Ew. That tastes horrible!
Homer,What is it you want from me? Money? Weed?
Homer,Manure for sale! Get your manure! Loamiest in town!
Homer,"Hey, the manure dealership is just one of the things I got goin'."
Homer,I also have a sweet gig as an infomercial question-asker.
Homer,"Um, I know Super Clean cleans, but does it scrub?"
Homer,My garage band is getting so tight.
Homer,"YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!"
Homer,The album cover's gonna be a naked girl with stars for boobs.
Homer,And I do open-casket caricatures.
Homer,Did he have any hobbies?
Homer,Kids? No way! You'll never see a couple of rug-rats tying me down!
Homer,"Marge, baby! I got a picture of you tattooed on my chest!"
Homer,They had a sale on skulls.
Homer,Screw you!
Homer,"Is that the same Jack from ""Jack and the Beanstalk""?"
Homer,"And Jack Sprat? Is that him, too?"
Homer,Is he the same as Jack be nimble? And Jack Frost? And little Jack Horner?
Homer,All gone!
Homer,You'd better not put this shot after the one where I said I won't have kids. That would be a devastating edit!
Homer,"Oh yeah? Check with me in eight years, Dr. Who. I'll be kickin' your ass with a solid gold boot!"
Homer,This pays a lot better than you think.
Homer,"Si, los cales."
Homer,INT. LAKESIDE MANSION - KITCHEN - PRESENT
Homer,Why not?
Homer,But you let in Homer Glumplet.
Homer,"I wish when I grow up, I'll be richer than everybody!"
Homer,"It hurts! It hurts so bad! Please, just put one in my brain!"
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"When I grow up, I'll have a giant mansion, my own pinball machine with infinity quarters, eight pairs of peanut butter and jelly pajamas. How many wishes do I have left?"
Homer,Got it.
Homer,No problem.
Homer,"Why, of cour-- No."
Homer,Squeaky! Squeaky!
Homer,"Squeaky, squeaky!"
Homer,"Squeaky, squeaky, squeaky!"
Homer,I lost my cleaning stick in my belly fat. But I found a kitten.
Homer,D'oh!
Homer,"All right Simpsons, welcome to our new home."
Homer,"Long have we awaited the coming of the White Man, and Carl."
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, I'll get right on it. Now in order to aid your journey across the land, I offer you the guidance of my daughter, Sacagawea. In our language, her name means ""Little Know-It-All Who Won't Shut Her Maize Hole."""
Homer,I don't know why I ever sold you to him.
Homer,"That's right. And if anyone asked who swindled you, it was Christians. Remember that name: Christians."
Homer,Crush them in the name of Jebus!
Homer,"Well, let's just say I hate crime."
Homer,Arrest that guy. And that's the end of that chapter...
Homer,"Coming, Chief."
Homer,I was supervising the guns for toys program.
Homer,Now you tell me!
Homer,Yes indeedy.
Homer,"Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's!"
Homer,"Let me down, Chief. I'm begging you. I'm a human being. Let me have my dignity back."
Homer,"You can run, but you can't glide!"
Homer,"Talky thing, ain't ya..."
Homer,"Oh you know, I'm a guy at a place. How'd you get such a crappy job? You a convict or a junkie?"
Homer,Oh yeah... wife and two or three kids. Can't imagine my life without 'em.
Homer,"At the end of a hard day, there's no better feeling than comin' home to the people you love."
Homer,Then there's those other days. Where you just wish you never got married or had kids.
Homer,"One minute, you're a carefree teenager with dreams of being a rock star, or a photographer for Playboy... Then bam, some babe gets her claws in ya...And boom, you got a buncha kids that always need love."
Homer,"So whammo, you get stuck in some boring job where they don't let you play guitar or take pictures of naked women, and all you can do is watch yourself get bald and fat, and kiss your dreams good-bye..."
Homer,It's always me.
Homer,I heard Lenny had a terrible fall.
Homer,"Yeah, falls'll getcha."
Homer,See? You don't have to spend a lot of money to have a first-class wedding reception.
Homer,"""Levi's."" Hey, you think that truck is full of jeans?"
Homer,What's she doing here?
Homer,Make Egyptian Slave Homer do it.
Homer,"Aw c'mon, Serious Homer, let me out! We'll get a monkey drunk and push him down the stairs."
Homer,"Hear me, people of Springfield. I come from yet another distant future where gun violence has destroyed the very Earth itself."
Homer,What the hell was I thinking?
Homer,I tried the broccoli again.
Homer,Maaarge Siiimpson.
Homer,You were wrong... dead wrong.
Homer,"No, not really. Marge, you gotta help me. I have to do one good deed to get into heaven."
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm just trying to get in. I'm not running for Jesus."
Homer,"Okay, good deed, good deed... hello!"
Homer,"No, she's mine!"
Homer,"Hey, stop squirming!"
Homer,Uh-oh. Uh... I'm pretty sure she was gonna be the next Hitler. Hello? Good deed done.
Homer,Nellllsonnnn...
Homer,I am the ghost of--
Homer,"Bart, help! Sonnn!"
Homer,"Just one minute left to get into heaven! There's gotta be some good deed I can do. C'mon, think, think."
Homer,Stop that crying!!
Homer,"Man, you're annoying."
Homer,Hamlet... avenge me!
Homer,"Yes, I have returned from the dead."
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"My son, I have some shocking news. I was murdered. Murdered, I tells ya!"
Homer,"Behold, as I slept, your Uncle Claudius poured poison in my ear... poison most foul...so he could marry your mother and become the King."
Homer,Now you must avenge me. Avenge me!
Homer,I'unno. Surprise me! Surprise me!
Homer,"Boy, our son can be a real jerk. Hey, you wanna have ghost sex?"
Homer,Then why were you moaning last time?
Homer,A ghost!
Homer,Moooooe... You killed meeeee.
Homer,"Oh, right."
Homer,"Wait a second! I'm in jail because of you! You were my friend, and you betrayed me."
Homer,Exactly. Exaaaaactly.
Homer,The senile old fool.
Homer,I do not miss Bart at all.
Homer,B'oh!
Homer,D'oh!
Homer,First over cliff.
Homer,You like back rub?
Homer,I dunno.
Homer,"Wow, this is soft..."
Homer,I peed my pants.
Homer,Beer... for me?
Homer,Chores? Me need clone.
Homer,Outfit good... flatters butt.
Homer,Me good Dad.
Homer,Nuh-uh.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Me concur.
Homer,I do!
Homer,Beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer!
Homer,Len-ny.
Homer,"Mmmmmm, donuts."
Homer,Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
Homer,"Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?"
Homer,Oh.
Homer,And?
Homer,"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand."
Homer,Me?
Homer,I don't think you realize what you're saying.
Homer,"Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
Homer,Go Away.
Homer,"Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?"
Homer,Nuts.
Homer,This isn't going well at all.
Homer,"No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say."
Homer,"Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof."
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?"
Homer,I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
Homer,Gimme a banana.
Homer,"Come on, you're holding out on me."
Homer,Think nothing of it.
Homer,"Hey, what's the matter, son?"
Homer,"Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?"
Homer,Would you have to do extra work?
Homer,"And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?"
Homer,"So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto."
Homer,Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
Homer,Uh oh.
Homer,"Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three."
Homer,"Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life."
Homer,Mmm... hors doovers.
Homer,I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
Homer,"Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better."
Homer,"Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah."
Homer,How do I look?
Homer,Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
Homer,What are all our friends names again?
Homer,Why not? I paid for it.
Homer,"Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?"
Homer,Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.
Homer,No.
Homer,"Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?"
Homer,It was me! You fell for it!
Homer,You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
Homer,Bart! Come over here.
Homer,"You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?"
Homer,"Bart, do that thing you do that's so cute."
Homer,That thing you know how to do.
Homer,Go to bed.
Homer,"Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!"
Homer,"I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve."
Homer,You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!
Homer,All right then.
Homer,Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude?
Homer,Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.
Homer,Why? What'd you do?
Homer,Marge!
Homer,Where-where are we going?
Homer,The way I acted?
Homer,So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
Homer,I put it there.
Homer,I slipped it into your glass as a gag.
Homer,"I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church."
Homer,"No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?"
Homer,About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
Homer,I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
Homer,Aw.
Homer,"Marge, Marge."
Homer,"Sorry, Reverend."
Homer,Hmmmm.
Homer,"Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea."
Homer,Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!
Homer,"Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!"
Homer,They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
Homer,"Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth."
Homer,"No, you don't!"
Homer,"Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk."
Homer,"Hmmm, bait."
Homer,"Whoa, better get some gas."
Homer,Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.
Homer,Catfish Lake.
Homer,"Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?"
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,"Whoa, who says that?"
Homer,Oh.
Homer,Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!
Homer,"None of your business, Flanders."
Homer,Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
Homer,Oh.
Homer,I see. I also understand bowling expressions.
Homer,Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
Homer,"Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress."
Homer,She's perfect.
Homer,"Well, sometimes that can be annoying."
Homer,I'm done.
Homer,It's true. It's all true.
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,I only did that a couple of times.
Homer,"Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime."
Homer,Would this be a good time to be honest?
Homer,"You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?"
Homer,No.
Homer,All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?
Homer,Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.
Homer,"Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!"
Homer,"Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it."
Homer,Good! Give up!
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show."
Homer,Whoa! Holy mackerel!
Homer,"I love you, but I must kill you."
Homer,I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!
Homer,"Uh, oh."
Homer,"Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?"
Homer,"Marge, you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero."
Homer,To those weirdos in the worm store.
Homer,"Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back."
Homer,Watch.
Homer,"Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby."
Homer,We're back!
Homer,Same as usual. Perfectomundo.
Homer,I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time.
Homer,"I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!"
Homer,"All right, what are you getting at?"
Homer,"A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?"
Homer,"Well, t.s."
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,"No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?"
Homer,Are you?
Homer,Are you?
Homer,Are you?
Homer,Are you?
Homer,Are you?
Homer,Are you?
Homer,Are you?
Homer,Are you?
Homer,Are you?
Homer,Are you?
Homer,"Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!"
Homer,Bart! What are you staring at?
Homer,Bart! Stop it!
Homer,"Hey, what's all the --"
Homer,My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
Homer,"What's the problem, boy?"
Homer,"Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money."
Homer,Nah.
Homer,"Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out."
Homer,They're fine.
Homer,"Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign."
Homer,How many hairs on my head? Without looking!
Homer,"I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job."
Homer,"Sorry, sir."
Homer,Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?
Homer,"Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it."
Homer,Earmuffs.
Homer,"Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it."
Homer,"Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!"
Homer,"Yeah, you have the right to remain silent."
Homer,"Bart, it's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. Don't you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?"
Homer,"Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches."
Homer,It was the olden days!
Homer,"Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!"
Homer,Now let's get the show on the road.
Homer,Eh.... the boy.
Homer,Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!
Homer,"Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!"
Homer,Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
Homer,"Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!"
Homer,"It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check."
Homer,"""Better half,"" Marge. ""Better half."""
Homer,"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!"
Homer,"This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That's what got me so mad in the first place."
Homer,"Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats..."
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter."
Homer,"""Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!"" Could you read that last part back to me?"
Homer,"Good. ""You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."""
Homer,An elephant's butt.
Homer,Yup!
Homer,"Forget it, Marge!"
Homer,"Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works."
Homer,Cheap son-of-a...
Homer,Hmmm...
Homer,"Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph."
Homer,Where's the letter?
Homer,Where is it?
Homer,"Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!"
Homer,"Bart, have you seen the letter?"
Homer,"All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?"
Homer,Uh huh.
Homer,Yeah...
Homer,Why did you do that?
Homer,I'll show you mad in the morning.
Homer,"She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!"
Homer,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Homer,"Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy."
Homer,"What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
Homer,"So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: ""Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo."" Big loss."
Homer,"Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal."
Homer,That's a good one. We'll use that.
Homer,"Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?"
Homer,"Well, I'm still gonna run!"
Homer,"Hello, my name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me."
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,"Great plan, Bart."
Homer,"Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry."
Homer,Oops.
Homer,Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take.
Homer,Homer Simpson.
Homer,"Yeah, well I'll be on my --"
Homer,"Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?"
Homer,"Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad."
Homer,Me and my big... letter writing pen!
Homer,"Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means."
Homer,"I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one."
Homer,"Oh, woe is me."
Homer,"Mr. Burns, you brought us a present."
Homer,"What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls..."
Homer,"Marge, what does it do?"
Homer,"Marge! Really, what does it do?"
Homer,"Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock."
Homer,"Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
Homer,Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
Homer,Amen to that!
Homer,Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?
Homer,"Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?"
Homer,"Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different."
Homer,"Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
Homer,"Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over."
Homer,You! You did this to me!
Homer,"Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --"
Homer,You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
Homer,Print name?
Homer,"Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form."
Homer,"All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it."
Homer,"Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?"
Homer,O-kay.
Homer,No deal.
Homer,"Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?"
Homer,Look at him!
Homer,Awww.
Homer,Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!
Homer,"Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV."
Homer,Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up!
Homer,"So, did I pass?"
Homer,The devil with his fly open.
Homer,That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it.
Homer,Arrghh!
Homer,The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,"I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons."
Homer,"Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?"
Homer,Doesn't ring a bell.
Homer,What was that last one?
Homer,Nope.
Homer,Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?
Homer,"No, that thing with your feet."
Homer,Because I wore a pink shirt.
Homer,What'd you wear?
Homer,Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--
Homer,"Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me."
Homer,Okay. Five times nine.
Homer,Wowww.
Homer,"Hey, Chief."
Homer,"Gee, I gotta call my family."
Homer,"Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I'm a god."
Homer,"Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight."
Homer,"That's all right, son."
Homer,What's that?
Homer,"This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared."
Homer,Pancakes... football... Boobies...
Homer,Was the door locked?
Homer,Was it raining?
Homer,Were you out of gas?
Homer,Baby.
Homer,Mmm... pancakes.
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please?"
Homer,Not insane.
Homer,"Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us."
Homer,You are? Why?
Homer,"Boy, when I get home, I'm going to wrap my hands around your neck --"
Homer,"Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice."
Homer,Are you sure you're here voluntarily?
Homer,Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane.
Homer,Here he is! Here's the guy you wanna see.
Homer,Huh? Huh?
Homer,Come off. I'm sane now.
Homer,Not me. I got this.
Homer,"Stupid junk mail... ""You May Have Already Won!"" Yeah, win this... ""Here's Good News for Homer Simpsoy""... I'll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am?"
Homer,Huh? A check?
Homer,One Million dollars? I'm rich!
Homer,"Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure?"
Homer,Shut up.
Homer,I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal.
Homer,"Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I'm not gonna start now."
Homer,"Hey, a cartoon."
Homer,"""Well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- Ain't it the truth."
Homer,"Oh, Marge. Cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh."
Homer,"Nah, you go ahead."
Homer,"As Tolstoy said in ""Quotable Notables,"" ""Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."""
Homer,"Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds."
Homer,"Ooh... How about the ""V""?"
Homer,"It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket."
Homer,Those kids don't know what they're missing.
Homer,We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
Homer,Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion. He'll be killed!
Homer,Don't be so...
Homer,"Oh, you're right."
Homer,Hmph?
Homer,"That reminds me! ""Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage."""
Homer,"Marge, you have a nice body. And if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask."
Homer,Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free!
Homer,"Wow! ""Win a Trip to Washington D.C.""! ""All expenses paid... VIP tour""... Oh. It's for kids."
Homer,Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question --
Homer,"Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine."
Homer,YEAH! Damn right!
Homer,Uh-uh.
Homer,Woo hoo! Who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?
Homer,"Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I've got coming to me."
Homer,We're all gonna die!
Homer,"Look, Marge, that guy has the same last name we do... Taxi!"
Homer,BOOOOO!
Homer,Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies!
Homer,"Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off."
Homer,Stupid welcoming mint! Y'ello.
Homer,Wake-up call? It's two AM!
Homer,Free food?!
Homer,"Ooh! I love your magazine. My favorite section is ""How To Increase Your Word Power."" That thing is really, really, really good."
Homer,"Miss? What does the ""I"" stand for?"
Homer,"Ah! What does the ""I"" stand for again?"
Homer,"Yeah, right."
Homer,Mmmmmm... Money.
Homer,Lousy cheap country...
Homer,BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis!
Homer,"Hey, what's so funny?"
Homer,"Oh Marge, grow up."
Homer,Who's that?
Homer,"Bart, are you ready to go to... I'll room service you..."
Homer,"Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'."
Homer,Gimme one of those!
Homer,Give her the check!
Homer,I was serious.
Homer,I'm almost done.
Homer,I'll be there. Not-y not-y not.
Homer,"Well, why doesn't he just say so?"
Homer,"Oh, here we go again. Look, I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. End of story."
Homer,"Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge, you really put me in my place."
Homer,"Don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. Marge Simpson... President of the International We Love Flanders Fan Club..."
Homer,"Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave."
Homer,"What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que."
Homer,"Hey, everyone, I'm back! Great to see ya! Nice seein' ya!"
Homer,"Hey, no tagbacks."
Homer,The fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake...
Homer,That was a joke?
Homer,Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
Homer,"Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz?"
Homer,Nah.
Homer,"No, it isn't."
Homer,"Hmm, let's see."
Homer,Nah.
Homer,Hmmm.
Homer,Heyyyy.
Homer,"Keep your pants on, Flanders! I'm wishing as fast as I can!"
Homer,Ooooh.
Homer,Mmmm -- too far.
Homer,Okay. Ready.
Homer,Yesssss! Oh yessss! Read it and weep. In your face. I've got more chicken bone!
Homer,Oooh. That would be a shame.
Homer,"Wouldn't it, Flanders?"
Homer,"Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend."
Homer,"See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology."
Homer,"Well, if it isn't the Leftorium."
Homer,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Homer,"Hey Flanders, how's business?"
Homer,"So, Flanders, have you sold anything?"
Homer,"I'm telling you, Flanders' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge?"
Homer,"No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I'm dying to know."
Homer,"Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?"
Homer,"Boy, those Germans have a word for everything."
Homer,"Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks."
Homer,"Ooh, the touch of death."
Homer,"Hey, boy. How was class?"
Homer,"Oh, that'll learn 'im."
Homer,"Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours?"
Homer,Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
Homer,"Uh, well actually, Moe..."
Homer,"Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You're that first apple I didn't want. That sinks it. I'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!"
Homer,"Homer Simpson, sir."
Homer,"Can I leave, Mr. Burns?"
Homer,But the note was asking you to --
Homer,"Um, Mr. Burns..."
Homer,"Sorry, Flanders."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?"
Homer,"Oh, I get it. It's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! Well, I wouldn't be caught dead buying this... Hello!"
Homer,I'll give you twenty bucks for it.
Homer,"You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it."
Homer,Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye!
Homer,Twenty dollars?
Homer,Now I don't want it.
Homer,"I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
Homer,"Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?"
Homer,Daddly-doodly.
Homer,Only seventy-five beans!
Homer,"Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there's just so many."
Homer,"I know, but... Wait a minute. I'm Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there."
Homer,Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?
Homer,"Uh, there's a store where..."
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"Knock 'em dead, boy! Kid's gonna be a black belt in no time."
Homer,"Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back."
Homer,You're gonna live in your car?
Homer,I know!
Homer,Why not?
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Oh, it's all my fault."
Homer,Yes it is.
Homer,"No, I was a swine."
Homer,"Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store?"
Homer,"Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!"
Homer,I SAID DO IT!
Homer,"Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me."
Homer,"C'mon, you lefties. What'd I tell you?"
Homer,"It's all here, and it's all backwards. That's right."
Homer,To Ned Flanders... the richest left- handed man in town.
Homer,"Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up!"
Homer,"That's Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh."
Homer,How much does it pay?
Homer,Pfft. I make more than that.
Homer,... Bart! Have you started smoking?
Homer,Don't lie to me boy.
Homer,"Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought."
Homer,"Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn..."
Homer,"Son, I'll never doubt you again."
Homer,"A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal."
Homer,See? It was all your imagination.
Homer,"Oh, all right."
Homer,"Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes."
Homer,"You know if you need a hat check girl, I've got a daughter."
Homer,"Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
Homer,Kill my boy! Kill my boy!
Homer,"Wait till I get you home, boy."
Homer,"Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit."
Homer,I thought he was dead.
Homer,"Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple."
Homer,"Hey, when do we get the check for this?"
Homer,You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers.
Homer,"Here's good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate."
Homer,"Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine."
Homer,What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets.
Homer,Huh? Noise. Bad noise!
Homer,"Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it."
Homer,Huh? AHHH!! It's my problem! We're doomed!!!
Homer,"Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT."
Homer,"Uh-huh. It's as fat as a phone book! ""Congratulations on your purchase of a Fissionator 1952 Slow Fission Reactor. Get to the point, man! Ooh, what's this?"
Homer,Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!
Homer,"I don't understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me!"
Homer,Shut up!
Homer,"Simpson, it's all up to you. It's showtime!"
Homer,"Okay, okay, think back to your training..."
Homer,Yes.
Homer,"Ooh, a side."
Homer,What?
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it."
Homer,"This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no!"
Homer,"Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe."
Homer,"Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button."
Homer,Magic Johnson! Y'ello.
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"Well, thank you."
Homer,"Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?"
Homer,"Thanks, Magic."
Homer,"Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home."
Homer,It tastes so bitter. It's like ashes in my mouth!
Homer,"What's your problem, boy?"
Homer,That four-eyes with the big nose? You don't need friends like that.
Homer,What? What is it? What are you doing?
Homer,"Well, as long as it's quiet."
Homer,"Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he'll never know who did it."
Homer,Huh? Wha?...
Homer,Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?
Homer,"But I really can't tell them anything, sir."
Homer,What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Homer,Did it work?
Homer,Uh... ladies and... gentlemen...
Homer,"Um, Grace under pressure is no..."
Homer,Whew! Saved by the bell.
Homer,All right.
Homer,"Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe."
Homer,Sure. Moe.
Homer,You think it's him?
Homer,What are you talking about? Of course he does.
Homer,We could have seen a monkey.
Homer,He's talking funny talk.
Homer,A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here.
Homer,Mel Brooks is Jewish?
Homer,"Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?"
Homer,"Yeah, Krusty, tell us."
Homer,"Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps."
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"No, that's it. You've seen everything."
Homer,Gladly.
Homer,"Hey, if you don't like it, go to Russia."
Homer,"Hey, aren't you a little old for this? You're not even wearing costumes."
Homer,"Here you go, kids. Lousy punks..."
Homer,Get a good haul this year?
Homer,"I am very, very proud of you kids."
Homer,I'd like to see that.
Homer,What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this?
Homer,Eeuhgh. What is this thing?
Homer,Oh yeah? How much?
Homer,"C'mom pal, I don't wanna hear your life story. Paw me!"
Homer,"Why at that little shop, right over... there."
Homer,"Oh no, wait, it was over there."
Homer,"Don't shoot, Don't shoot. They're souvenirs."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Forget it, you two. As the pants- wearer of this house, I get the first wish."
Homer,"Marge, don't flake out on me. That monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true."
Homer,"Ooh, a luxury car. Good baby. Good Maggie."
Homer,Now you're talkin'!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"C'mon, everybody. We're going to the fanciest restaurant in town!"
Homer,"Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was just being colorful."
Homer,"Lisa, that was very selfish of you."
Homer,"Ok, Ok. I'll make a wish that can't backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, And...AND! I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises. You got it?"
Homer,"Hey... Hmm. Not bad. Nice hot mustard... good bread... Turkey's a little dry. The turkey's a little dry?! Oh foul, accursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee?!"
Homer,"Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that's what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh."
Homer,I wish I had a Monkey's Paw.
Homer,Hiya Bart!!! How's my boy! Heh heh. Heh heh.
Homer,"It's good that you made that awful thing, Bart. It's real good."
Homer,"He gets it from your side of the family, you know. No monsters on my side."
Homer,Come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please.
Homer,Shut up boy. If they make this field goal I win fifty bucks.
Homer,"Slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh."
Homer,I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning.
Homer,Ouch!
Homer,"Good night, son."
Homer,"Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back."
Homer,"Oh, ah, thanks boy."
Homer,"I love you, son."
Homer,You both toilet-trained?
Homer,"Well, okay then... ... Four o'clock... Coupla hours I have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work."
Homer,Huh? What?
Homer,For what?
Homer,How do you know I was sleeping?
Homer,Camera?
Homer,How hard can it be?
Homer,"Ooo, what job is that?"
Homer,Sheesh. What a slave driver.
Homer,No. Bart bit me.
Homer,I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
Homer,I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!
Homer,Umm. Spaghetti.
Homer,"Oh, I hate having two heads."
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,"Don't worry, I know it's tonight."
Homer,Uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?
Homer,"Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed."
Homer,"Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?"
Homer,"Hurry, Moe, hurry! I've only got five minutes till the music store closes."
Homer,"Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?"
Homer,"You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top."
Homer,Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare.
Homer,The moron next door closed early!
Homer,"Oh, me and my trenchant mouth."
Homer,"Hmm. ""Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!"" Yes! That's it!"
Homer,"Please, you've got to open that store."
Homer,"Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. Well I don't have one."
Homer,"I'll have you know, I wrote it down."
Homer,Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!
Homer,Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!
Homer,I dunno.
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again?
Homer,"Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah!
Homer,I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh.
Homer,That cost eighty-eight dollars!
Homer,"Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me."
Homer,You didn't mean that!
Homer,No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie."
Homer,"Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for."
Homer,"Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony."
Homer,"Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore."
Homer,"See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes."
Homer,"Ha ha, you love me."
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Homer,Mm.
Homer,Buh.
Homer,Sneh.
Homer,"Excuse me, do you sell ponies?"
Homer,"""Scot-tish deer-hound."" Hey, this is a dog!"
Homer,"Now lady, I'm buying this pony for my little girl, and I don't care what it costs."
Homer,Half a million dollars?!
Homer,Wow!
Homer,I'll take it!
Homer,"Uh, sure... let me write you a check."
Homer,Is there a problem with that?
Homer,Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?
Homer,I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.
Homer,"Mr. Burns, you do this personally?"
Homer,U-su-ry?
Homer,I want to buy a pony.
Homer,No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,Of course.
Homer,"Simpson, you've done it again."
Homer,Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
Homer,Because she stopped loving me.
Homer,I know you love me. So you don't get squat. Hee hee hee hee.
Homer,I've got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
Homer,"That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me."
Homer,Stable? That sounds expensive.
Homer,This is what love costs a month?
Homer,Oh nuts.
Homer,I was hoping it'd be money.
Homer,"Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have."
Homer,"Nah, we're not gonna be doing that."
Homer,"First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind."
Homer,"Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays."
Homer,"Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it."
Homer,Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?
Homer,Need money. Need money.
Homer,"One Scratch-for-Cash, please."
Homer,"Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That'll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu."
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,There it is.
Homer,No.
Homer,No! No!
Homer,No! You can't see... come on!
Homer,No!
Homer,Let go. You're ripping it.
Homer,Ohh... I need money.
Homer,You're looking for help?
Homer,I'm your man!
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,...Badge of honor.
Homer,But I eat... Oh.
Homer,"Heh heh, the perfect crime."
Homer,"Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I'm not proud of and I don't want the kids to hear it."
Homer,"I'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy."
Homer,Mmm... salty.
Homer,No sir.
Homer,Yes sir.
Homer,I don't know. How long do horses live?
Homer,Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core.
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me?
Homer,Going for... eight hour walk.
Homer,Homer sleep now.
Homer,"Coming right up, sir."
Homer,"Yes, sir."
Homer,"Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money..."
Homer,You did?
Homer,"Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus!"
Homer,Awww.
Homer,Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it!
Homer,That baby changed our lives.
Homer,Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.
Homer,In the garage.
Homer,"Yeah, give us a break, Doctor."
Homer,"If stuff starts flying, just turn your head."
Homer,"Okay, okay, calm down."
Homer,"Okay, I will. I will."
Homer,"Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise."
Homer,"... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah."
Homer,Shh! They'll hear you.
Homer,I don't know. Some guy I guess.
Homer,"Oh sure, great idea. I'd love to -- Did you hear that?"
Homer,How much?
Homer,"What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?"
Homer,Anything for my little girl.
Homer,Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid.
Homer,"Ooooooh, McBain."
Homer,Why? I just saw the best part.
Homer,"Oooh, ""Death by Knockout,"" ""Blood on the Ice"" Oh, oh... ""Football's Greatest Injuries"". Lisa, we're going."
Homer,Just grab something. All these movies are great.
Homer,"Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman."
Homer,Oh Marge.
Homer,"Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets."
Homer,Okay. Hank.
Homer,Hank... Jones.
Homer,Steve McQueen.
Homer,Next.
Homer,"Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord."
Homer,Then he has no hobbies.
Homer,Bart!... BART!!!
Homer,"You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?"
Homer,"Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?"
Homer,"Oh, that's a hobby!"
Homer,"Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy... I'm a bad father!"
Homer,I'm also fat!
Homer,I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero.
Homer,"Goodbye, son."
Homer,"Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold."
Homer,"Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?"
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Oh, how I envy you!"
Homer,I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
Homer,What boy?
Homer,"Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer."
Homer,Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.
Homer,"Okay. No, I'm gonna do it."
Homer,But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.
Homer,"What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you."
Homer,Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.
Homer,"Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh?"
Homer,"Oh, that sounds too complicated."
Homer,"All right, I will! Son, I don't think you should let me help you."
Homer,"Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!"
Homer,"You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit."
Homer,"I like our chances, son."
Homer,This is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him!
Homer,"Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!"
Homer,Are you nervous son?
Homer,"Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks..."
Homer,"Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson."
Homer,When did I ever teach you that?
Homer,"Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad."
Homer,"I'll just sit here in ""Li'l Lightnin'"" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son."
Homer,Ow.
Homer,Why? What's wrong?
Homer,"Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?"
Homer,"Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!"
Homer,No!
Homer,"I'm not pouting, you are."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,No. Can't think of a thing.
Homer,Leave me alone.
Homer,"Name your son's hobbies. Building a soapbox racer... ""Name your child's friends."" Martin... Martin! I'll curse that name 'til the day I die... Huh? ""Who is your son's heroe?""..."
Homer,Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck!
Homer,"Wow, I'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
Homer,Shut up Flanders. Flanders!
Homer,"Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?"
Homer,"Great, thanks."
Homer,"I talked to Flanders about parenting. I'm a perfect father. Hold on, son, I'm-a coming!"
Homer,"Do it for your old man, boy!"
Homer,"No, son, you earned it."
Homer,"That's my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!"
Homer,"Wow, infotainment."
Homer,He's not so fat.
Homer,"Bart, why are you still up?"
Homer,"Boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego."
Homer,"What is it, boy?"
Homer,"Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man."
Homer,"Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad?"
Homer,"You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh."
Homer,Run for it boy!
Homer,That's it. I'm outta here.
Homer,"What's the matter, Moe?"
Homer,"Yeah, things are tough all over."
Homer,Could I get a beer?
Homer,"Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself..."
Homer,One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation.
Homer,"As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink."
Homer,"Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?"
Homer,I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
Homer,In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.
Homer,It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.
Homer,"I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good."
Homer,"A ""Flaming Homer""."
Homer,"Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?"
Homer,Try lighting it on fire.
Homer,"Well, it's called a ""Flaming..."
Homer,"Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?"
Homer,Why yes I --
Homer,I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!
Homer,Take that off this second!
Homer,"Nah... Marge, I'm too upset to eat -- I think I'll go to Moe's. ."
Homer,I need to talk to Moe.
Homer,I didn't even tell you my name.
Homer,Homer Simpson.
Homer,But--
Homer,Barney?
Homer,You're my kid's teacher!
Homer,No!
Homer,Get away from me.
Homer,"Hey, Moe?"
Homer,"I'd rather have a ""Flaming Homer""."
Homer,"How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it."
Homer,"If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise."
Homer,"Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer!"
Homer,"I said, you just lost yourself a customer!"
Homer,You just lost yourself a customer.
Homer,"You just lost yourself a customer, Moe!"
Homer,You just lost yourself a customer.
Homer,You just lost yourself a customer.
Homer,"Ah, my new watering hole."
Homer,A beer?
Homer,Can I have a clean glass?
Homer,Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed...
Homer,"Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!"
Homer,"Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic."
Homer,Moe... Moe... Moe...
Homer,Moe... Moe... Moe.
Homer,"Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe..."
Homer,"Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe's. All the time wondering, ""How does he do it?"" Well, I'm going tell you. The secret ingredient is..."
Homer,"Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!"
Homer,"Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?"
Homer,"Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars."
Homer,I guess so.
Homer,"Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have."
Homer,"Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?"
Homer,"Oh, what do they want!"
Homer,It's not fair!
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,"Ooh, that's a lot of money."
Homer,"Uh, Mr. Smithers, do you have change for a dollar?"
Homer,Homer Simpson here.
Homer,I own stock?
Homer,"So uh, how much did it go up?"
Homer,Yeah...
Homer,Sure...
Homer,Not any more...
Homer,That'd be great.
Homer,Well... how are you?
Homer,Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to?
Homer,What should I do?
Homer,Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!
Homer,"Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer..."
Homer,"No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve."
Homer,"For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy."
Homer,"Have a Duff, boys!"
Homer,"Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?"
Homer,"Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars."
Homer,Hey... hey!
Homer,You heard?
Homer,"Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too."
Homer,I spent it on beer.
Homer,Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about?
Homer,What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Did you buy this car with your stock money?
Homer,We could all lose our jobs.
Homer,"Well, they can't fire me."
Homer,Cuz... I...
Homer,Lucky drunks.
Homer,"Yeah! Sock it to him, Horst!"
Homer,"Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know anything about Germany?"
Homer,"Good, good, I'm learning."
Homer,Because we send them money?
Homer,"Oh, woa is me."
Homer,"Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it."
Homer,"Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing."
Homer,"Ooh, Battlestar Galactica."
Homer,"Fit, damn you! Fit!"
Homer,There.
Homer,Huh? What?
Homer,"Oh, what am I gonna... Hey, you! top being so unsafe! Smitty -- safen-up!"
Homer,No.
Homer,No!
Homer,Auugghh!
Homer,Uh... all of them?
Homer,I sure do!
Homer,"Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy."
Homer,Mmm. The land of chocolate...
Homer,Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
Homer,La la la la la...
Homer,La la la la la la...
Homer,"Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. We were talking about chocolate?"
Homer,I think I did pretty good in there.
Homer,"Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing."
Homer,No problems here.
Homer,"I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!"
Homer,That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
Homer,Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
Homer,"Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?"
Homer,"And does it ever say, ""I love you?"""
Homer,"Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!"
Homer,Nobody loves you...
Homer,Na na na na / Na na na na /
Homer,Woo-hoo! I got my job back!
Homer,"But Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe."
Homer,"Well, what color is it? Blue or purple?"
Homer,"Oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?"
Homer,"Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get."
Homer,"No, everything's fine. Your mother uh, just, broke her leg."
Homer,Maybe.
Homer,"Yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings."
Homer,"Yeah, but I have to hear about it."
Homer,"Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your mother. ... It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s."
Homer,"Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young!"
Homer,For several years I'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center.
Homer,"Yes, sir."
Homer,"I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future..."
Homer,"Hey, you're supposed to be listening to my story!"
Homer,"Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. Lousy, ungrateful... Can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh..."
Homer,Where do you think you're going? You're gonna listen to my story.
Homer,Your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.
Homer,You mean like will apes be our masters?
Homer,But it gives me time to think.
Homer,"Well, girls I mean I mean boys. I, I mean you!"
Homer,"Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father."
Homer,"Marge, you're as pretty as Princess Leia and as smart as Yoda."
Homer,I'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
Homer,"Oh. Well he's always happy. No, wait. He's always mad."
Homer,Someday I'll buy you a real castle.
Homer,"Phew, good."
Homer,Really? It must be the Champale talking.
Homer,Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!
Homer,Pass the cookie dough.
Homer,"Y'ello... Oh, hi Marge..."
Homer,Why? What's wrong?
Homer,Oh.
Homer,... ...
Homer,Because it's the honorable thing to do?
Homer,"Marge, there's something I want to ask you. But I'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal."
Homer,"Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?"
Homer,"Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket."
Homer,What's it say?
Homer,That's the card. Give it here.
Homer,So... will you marry me?
Homer,"Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Yeah! She's gonna marry me. In your face, everybody... Woo hoo!"
Homer,"You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago."
Homer,"Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call him Larry Fairy."
Homer,They'll call him Screwy Louie.
Homer,Slob.
Homer,Puke.
Homer,Mucous.
Homer,"Let's see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, can't see any problem with that. Wow! I'll take that ring!"
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,"Finally, the big day came. We didn't have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line."
Homer,Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever.
Homer,"Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a better place."
Homer,I am?
Homer,Homer.
Homer,I do.
Homer,Our first night together as man and wife.
Homer,"Look what I got, Marge, a baby monitor."
Homer,Baby to Marge. Baby to Marge. Wah! Wah! Over.
Homer,"Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well."
Homer,Pfft. Now you tell me.
Homer,"Dear Marge, XXX. Homer."
Homer,Well... It takes me a long time to learn anything... I'm kind of a goof-off...
Homer,... Little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace.
Homer,There's a problem with the reactor?! We're all gonna die!!!
Homer,"Nah, they wanted someone good. Story of my life."
Homer,"Wow! Kid, I won't let you down."
Homer,"I swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job."
Homer,"... And when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold."
Homer,Oh!
Homer,"Good evening, Madame. You have been selected by the good people of Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Nev-R-Dull knife-edge. Here... shake hands with the Slash-Co."
Homer,"Handle first, handle first..."
Homer,I quit! I quit!
Homer,Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I said it first!
Homer,"I don't know, I don't know --"
Homer,"""Dear Marge... By the time you read this, I will be gone. You deserve all the finest things in the world. And although I can give them to you, they will be repossessed and I will be hunted down like a dog. Also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here."""
Homer,I will send you every cent I earn for the baby. But you will not see me again until I am a man.
Homer,"Oh, c'mon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the responsible head of a household."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Big shots with their stainless steel lunchboxes...
Homer,They get donuts?
Homer,Wowww.
Homer,"Yeah, what do you want?"
Homer,You want fries with that?
Homer,Marge?
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"Holy cow, you're as big as a house."
Homer,"No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring."
Homer,"Marge, for you."
Homer,"Oh, sure."
Homer,Because I knocked you up?
Homer,You the boss?
Homer,Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!
Homer,"Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man. You can treat me like dirt and I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don't like it... I can change!!"
Homer,You mean?
Homer,I got the job. I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!
Homer,Marge!... Marge!...
Homer,The hospital?
Homer,"Thanks, mom."
Homer,"Marge! Marge, where's the baby?"
Homer,Shut up!
Homer,"No, you listen! This is my wife and this is my kid, and I'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!"
Homer,"Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!"
Homer,"And tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back! Then I'm going house-hunting!"
Homer,"Eh, somebody'll cover for me."
Homer,"Oh, college boy, eh?"
Homer,"Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me."
Homer,"Ahh, Bart. Daddy's little angel."
Homer,Why you little... He did that on purpose!
Homer,"Bart, Lisa. Come here for a minute..."
Homer,"Y'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have."
Homer,"As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more."
Homer,And not a day goes by that we don't thank God for all three of you.
Homer,"Yeah!!! Whoa! Excellent, Marge!"
Homer,"Aw, ain't that cute... Hey!"
Homer,Hey! Where in God's name did you learn that kind of... daaaanncciinng!
Homer,Mon-ey.
Homer,"Oh, sorry."
Homer,That could be Bart!
Homer,He's in for some lovin'.
Homer,Hm... Bart's birthday's coming up.
Homer,Limited?!
Homer,Do you have any of those microphones left?
Homer,"Y'know, Marge. Bart's really gonna like my birthday present this year. It won't be like those shoe trees I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I'll buy his love yet."
Homer,"Bart, I'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present!"
Homer,There's only one can of beer left and it's Bart's.
Homer,"Hey boy, how's the microphone working?"
Homer,Bart! I would love to get a present like that.
Homer,"Listen, boy, this is a great invention! Watch."
Homer,WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / ROCKIN' THROUGH THE NIGHT / WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / AIN'T SHE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT / CON-VOY
Homer,"Hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!"
Homer,Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Homer,Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Homer,"Marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream."
Homer,Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Homer,"Why, you little..."
Homer,Wait a minute. Does this mean you like my present?
Homer,Aww...
Homer,Just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes.
Homer,"Hey, what's up?"
Homer,"Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero."
Homer,"Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out..."
Homer,"Well, it's more than you did!"
Homer,You must think we're the worst parents in the world.
Homer,"Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll..."
Homer,"Hey, don't make me come down there!"
Homer,"Why, you little --"
Homer,"It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident."
Homer,"Uh, could you edit that last part out?"
Homer,"Don't worry, you'll grow into it."
Homer,"That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself."
Homer,"Shh! Marge, he's a good digger."
Homer,"Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again."
Homer,"Well, bye-bye belt."
Homer,"Pfft, my heart is just fine."
Homer,A little beer will put out that fire.
Homer,"Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!"
Homer,"Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver."
Homer,Twenty big ones on Denver.
Homer,"All right, Denver. Justify my love."
Homer,"Lousy, stupid Denver."
Homer,Why did you do that?
Homer,"Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there."
Homer,Over.
Homer,Over... over... over...
Homer,"Lisa, please, I can't hear the announcer."
Homer,Why didn't you say that before!
Homer,"Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy."
Homer,"Huh, they both make a good case."
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,Line...
Homer,"Yeah, lay it on me, coach."
Homer,Mm-hm.
Homer,Cincinnati...
Homer,Cincinnati.
Homer,Cincinnati.
Homer,"C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize this is costing me money?"
Homer,"Doh, not the wind."
Homer,Oh...
Homer,... miles per hour.
Homer,"Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?"
Homer,"Good, good. Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins."
Homer,"All right, Dolphins!"
Homer,Whoo-hoo!
Homer,Fifty big ones!
Homer,"Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game."
Homer,"Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting."
Homer,"Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?"
Homer,And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things...
Homer,"That's right. My God, it's like there's some kind of bond between us."
Homer,YEAH!
Homer,"You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible."
Homer,"Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?"
Homer,You bet.
Homer,"Me too, honey."
Homer,Sure! You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
Homer,All right!
Homer,What? Didn't you hear what he said?
Homer,You think we should bet against them?
Homer,You got it.
Homer,"Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York."
Homer,"Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games?"
Homer,"My daughter, that's who!"
Homer,"Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift."
Homer,"Oh, my little girl says the cutest things."
Homer,Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day.
Homer,"The usual, Moe. A beer and a wad of bills."
Homer,I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory.
Homer,Tut-tut. Only the best for my family.
Homer,"Hello, I'm Homer. I'll be your customer."
Homer,"Oh, violin guy!"
Homer,"What's your favorite song, Lisa?"
Homer,Play on.
Homer,"Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks."
Homer,You promised you wouldn't get mad!
Homer,"Good, good... You call Moe."
Homer,"Barney, are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that?"
Homer,Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers.
Homer,"Boy, I know you're gonna like your present."
Homer,"All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad."
Homer,"All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football."
Homer,"But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?"
Homer,"Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together."
Homer,"Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted."
Homer,"Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this."
Homer,"Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney."
Homer,"Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away."
Homer,"Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me."
Homer,"Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh?"
Homer,It's a date! So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread?
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Dallas! Whoo-hoo!
Homer,"However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?"
Homer,"Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: ""Daddy should bet all his money on..."""
Homer,"Oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. I gotta get outta here."
Homer,"Don't worry, Moe. I'm not bettin'."
Homer,"I had the greatest gift of all, a little girl who could pick football and I ruined it."
Homer,Buffalo's gonna win. Lisa hates me!
Homer,My daughter.
Homer,Not Duff Dry... Dallas.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"All right, we're back in business."
Homer,"Please, please, please..."
Homer,Yes! She loves me! She loves me!
Homer,"Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!"
Homer,It's beautiful.
Homer,After I catch my breath... can we... go... home?
Homer,"Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, can I have two sandwiches today? Make them bologna sandwiches too. Can I have two slices of bologna and cheese..."
Homer,"Marge, can you take my ball to Nick's today? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole."
Homer,Alley balls?
Homer,Alley balls...
Homer,"Hey sweetheart, what's the matter?! Not gettin' enough of the good stuff at home?"
Homer,Let me through! Let me through! I'm her husband!
Homer,Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Hello?
Homer,What should I say?
Homer,Yes it's me!
Homer,I love you very much.
Homer,"And uh... later tonight I think you and I should uh, snuggle."
Homer,"Look Marge, I can tell something's bothering you. But if you come out of that car, I promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. Please, honey?"
Homer,"Well, all's well that ends well. Goodnight, Marge."
Homer,Whaa...
Homer,"What? But Marge, we just had a vacation. Remember Mystic Caverns?"
Homer,"I know you do, Marge. But come on, you know what our vacations are like. Those three monsters in the back seat. ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" And let's face it, I'm no day at the beach either. ""Marge, can I have another sandwich? Marge, can I have another sandwich?"""
Homer,"What? You mean we're getting a divorce? Marge, I can change!"
Homer,"Well, okay. But you have to swear you're comin' back."
Homer,All right then.
Homer,She's startin' to give.
Homer,"For your information, I can take care of my --"
Homer,See? Got her on the first bounce.
Homer,Good bye? Where's my clean underwear?
Homer,How often should I change Maggie?
Homer,"Marge, Marge, how do I use the pressure cooker?"
Homer,Hello Maggie.
Homer,"Sorry, honey, mommy went crazy...And went far, far away..."
Homer,"So, it's going to be just you and me for awhile. Just you and me."
Homer,"C'mon, Maggie. Nummy, nummy num."
Homer,Mmm. Strained peas.
Homer,Let go!
Homer,Hi Barney. Thanks for keeping me company.
Homer,"All right, but just be careful."
Homer,"GO TO SLEEP AND GOODNIGHT/ DA DA DA / DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA/ DEE DEE DEE / DEE DEE / May your Christmas day be nice. Goodnight, my little pork chop."
Homer,"Oh Maggie, time for your nine a.m. feeding."
Homer,"Heh, heh, heh."
Homer,Maggie?
Homer,Maggie?
Homer,Maggie?
Homer,Maggie?
Homer,Maggieeee!!!!
Homer,"Barney, I've lost the baby. It's the worst thing I've ever done."
Homer,Just help me look!
Homer,C'mon!
Homer,Barney! You're gonna pull her arm off.
Homer,Hello... I'd like the department of missing babies.
Homer,I came to see the kids.
Homer,Hmmm.
Homer,Hey kids... uh... you haven't seen Maggie around anyplace have you?
Homer,"Well, I gotta go."
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,"Listen, Marge, uh, how would you feel if I told you the dog ran away?"
Homer,"Oh. Well, I've got good news for you. The dog didn't run away."
Homer,"Now, Marge. Maggie was very young. It's not like we got so attached to her. No. Marge, isn't life funny? One day they're babies, the next thing you know, they're off on their own. Oh."
Homer,Yes.
Homer,Uh... she's small... she's a girl...
Homer,Oh Maggie!
Homer,"You found my baby. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Homer,You're not going anywhere.
Homer,Never leave again... never leave again... never leave again.
Homer,"You got it, sweetheart. You have enough blanket there?"
Homer,Marge. Come here.
Homer,Can you believe it? Pretty soon I'll be able to quit my job and live off the boy.
Homer,"Marge, dogs love the outdoors."
Homer,"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
Homer,"Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers."
Homer,"Yes you are. You've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I'll build him a dog house."
Homer,Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it.
Homer,"This is the door. He goes through that. This is the roof. And this happy character here is the sun. He shines down on the house, see."
Homer,Stupid lumber...
Homer,Dammit! Son of a --
Homer,The hell with this!
Homer,"""Maybe it's the beer talking, Marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here."""
Homer,"Damn, crappy nails! Super glue my butt!"
Homer,"What is it, Flanders?"
Homer,"Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay?"
Homer,What the hell are you talking about?
Homer,"Oh come on now, Flanders, I don't complain about your your... moustache."
Homer,Makes you look like you've got something to hide.
Homer,People are talking... lots of people.
Homer,Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead.
Homer,"Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you're not laughing."
Homer,"Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, Ned Flanders?"
Homer,"Look, we're past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that's the way God made me. And I'm too old to stop now."
Homer,"Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar."
Homer,Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with the hammer?
Homer,What if I catch on fire?
Homer,What if I see something really weird in the sky?
Homer,What about when we snuggle?
Homer,God --
Homer,"Ohh, you son-of-a."
Homer,You dirty bas...
Homer,"What do ya think, Lisa?"
Homer,"Well, he just goes... Ohhh"
Homer,"Oh fudge, that's broken."
Homer,"Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down."
Homer,Where'd you get the money?
Homer,Maggie. Oh. Cute.
Homer,Beer! How did you know?
Homer,"Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night."
Homer,"Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth."
Homer,"Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear."
Homer,Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty.
Homer,"""Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you."""
Homer,"I may hold you to that, Marge."
Homer,Three simple words. I am gay.
Homer,P.S. -- I am gay.
Homer,"How about, ""With a love that will echo through the ages?"""
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"Mmm, do - nuts."
Homer,Don't tell me how to eat donuts --
Homer,Softball?
Homer,Who's next?
Homer,What's the matter with you guys?
Homer,"Look, I know it wasn't our best season."
Homer,"Well, this year's gonna be different."
Homer,I have a secret weapon.
Homer,"Come here boy, I want to show you something."
Homer,"It's something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house..."
Homer,"Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find."
Homer,"Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of."
Homer,I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
Homer,And here it is.
Homer,Let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.
Homer,"Check it out, boys. My magic bat."
Homer,"Yeah, just watch."
Homer,Woo hoooooo!
Homer,Ha ha. Cops can't win!
Homer,"Kids, kids, kids. You can each get me a beer. But first let's see it again in super slow motion."
Homer,"I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry!"
Homer,You're Darryl Strawberry.
Homer,You play right field.
Homer,I play right field too.
Homer,"Well, are you better than me?"
Homer,It's not fair. Me and the guys worked so hard to get to the championship game and now we'll be sitting on a bench.
Homer,"Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do."
Homer,"Well now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's a crock. No matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you."
Homer,I got it! I got it!
Homer,"Hey, I called for that!"
Homer,No.
Homer,"These guys aren't so tough. I've got ""Wonder Bat."""
Homer,"Please, please, please, I want to make the team. Clemens, did I make the team?"
Homer,One thing I'm good at and I can't do it anymore.
Homer,Like what?
Homer,"Yeah, but none of my friends can watch me."
Homer,Where do you think you're going?
Homer,"No, no, no! I don't want you to see me sitting on my butt."
Homer,"They're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me."
Homer,I am? Whoo-hoo!
Homer,Yes.
Homer,Uh uh.
Homer,Got it.
Homer,"Yes, sir!"
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Lurleen.
Homer,"Good one, Lenny."
Homer,"So what're you gonna be, boy?"
Homer,"No, the Army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb."
Homer,Wait a minute. Isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps?
Homer,Stupid fingers.
Homer,"Look, I didn't steal that copper wire. I just thought they were throwing it out. Here, take it."
Homer,Good for you. Maybe this'll straighten the boy out.
Homer,We always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can't both our kids be good?
Homer,Maaarge... The dog doesn't count as a kid.
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,One hundred and thirty million dollars!
Homer,"Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what's your birthday? No kidding. And what's Lisa's birthday?... What? You don't know your sister's birthday? What kind of brother are you?"
Homer,You'll never guess what happened Marge! Are you ready? I... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery!
Homer,"I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money..."
Homer,"You don't understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you."
Homer,"Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery!"
Homer,"Hey, down in front."
Homer,Whoo-hoo!
Homer,I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery.
Homer,"Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?"
Homer,What do kids know about spending money?
Homer,Hmm...
Homer,"Look closer, Lenny!"
Homer,Fourteen carat gold!
Homer,"Take a hike boss, I'm running things now."
Homer,I've got so many tickets I can't lose!
Homer,"Receipts, ugh."
Homer,"Well why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we'd be rich! But no! You had to be ""10."""
Homer,"Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not."
Homer,"Hey, you did the best you could."
Homer,Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over.
Homer,"Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven."
Homer,"In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and..."
Homer,Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
Homer,Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester.
Homer,Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.
Homer,But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
Homer,"Oh, come on! I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. Marge, make him stop."
Homer,All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog.
Homer,Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
Homer,I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
Homer,I thought maybe you...
Homer,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time."
Homer,What?
Homer,But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
Homer,"Maybe you're right, Marge."
Homer,"Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?"
Homer,Chub? I don't even know what that is!
Homer,"Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats..."
Homer,"Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?"
Homer,Mmm... snouts.
Homer,"Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy."
Homer,A dinosaur.
Homer,BUFFALO GALS WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS...
Homer,AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN!
Homer,My quarter!!!
Homer,"I know you can't understand me, but you're a lousy dog and I hate you."
Homer,Yes.
Homer,"Oh, you mean tonight."
Homer,Bart! Close the gate.
Homer,Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse.
Homer,Uh...the last one.
Homer,"That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug."
Homer,"Oh, Marge! There is no such place!"
Homer,Or... to put it another way... there is.
Homer,And I'll be right here watching TV.
Homer,Two tickets for...
Homer,Let me pet him again!
Homer,I know. I want to pet him again!
Homer,The cat? What's the point?
Homer,"Oooh, there's a good one."
Homer,"Marge, that's just a suggested car size."
Homer,Easy... easy... How'm I doing on the right?
Homer,"Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, everybody out the window."
Homer,"Ooh, they all look great."
Homer,"Look Who's Oinking! ""Look Who's Oinking""!"
Homer,That's right.
Homer,"Why Marge, you frisky little devil."
Homer,"We'll take two tickets to ""The Stockholm Affair."""
Homer,Political!
Homer,"Ah, this movie's too complicated... Hey, the floor's sticky..."
Homer,"Who's that guy?... What did that guy say when I said, ""Who's that guy?"""
Homer,"Oh, that submarine's so fake... Look, you can see the strings... Ooh! An octopus!"
Homer,What?
Homer,I think that guy's a spy.
Homer,"Oh wait, I heard how this ends. It turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter."
Homer,"Hey, it's pretty obvious if you think about it."
Homer,"Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight you robbed me of it. I'm going now and I don't know when you'll see me again."
Homer,Mmm...
Homer,"Ew, a skunk!"
Homer,Oh no.
Homer,"Ooh, a redneck bar."
Homer,Duff please.
Homer,"Okay, Fudd me."
Homer,Stupid Marge tell me to shut up.
Homer,Yeah...
Homer,... that's true.
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,"That's right, except for the pick-up truck."
Homer,"Oh, no. I went to this bar the other night, and they..."
Homer,"Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I've gotta say somethin' to ya."
Homer,Your song touched me in a way I've never felt before. And which way to the can?
Homer,Homer J. Simpson.
Homer,That's a pretty name.
Homer,Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.
Homer,Bye Lurleen.
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,I was just up at this bar in Spittle County.
Homer,"Marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'."
Homer,I WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ I SWEAT AND BREAK MY BACK/
Homer,YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO...
Homer,"Hey Moe, you got any Fudd?"
Homer,"Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town."
Homer,"Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind. I haven't felt this way since ""Funky Town."""
Homer,Do you think I could get a copy of it?
Homer,"Lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!"
Homer,Come with me!
Homer,I guess so.
Homer,"Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?"
Homer,"Well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady."
Homer,"Marge, you make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits."
Homer,"Well hi, Lurleen. We were just talking about you. Uh... I think I can come over. Let me ask my wife."
Homer,It's a date!
Homer,"Don't thank me, Lurleen, you should be thanking your brain."
Homer,"Well, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now I feel kinda guilty about it."
Homer,"Thanks. You did say sugar, right?"
Homer,"Really? Well, I should warn you... I'm not great with figures..."
Homer,I make a lot of stupid decisions...
Homer,I did bad in school.
Homer,My personal hygiene has been described as...
Homer,"Marge, look at me."
Homer,"Uh, then maybe you better not look at me."
Homer,A friend bought it for me.
Homer,No... I think it was Lenny.
Homer,No!
Homer,No!
Homer,A coupla times.
Homer,I can't. I'm her manager.
Homer,"Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer."
Homer,"Marge, Lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, I'm going to be there."
Homer,I'm sure Lurleen will love it.
Homer,"Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. I'm not going to go into hock for this."
Homer,"Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen."
Homer,"I don't have time to answer all these questions. Uh, time is money. Come on, people!"
Homer,Stop it.
Homer,"You, off the bench."
Homer,"Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV."
Homer,"Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new."
Homer,Let's hear it.
Homer,"Oh, that's hot. There isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. Well, g'bye."
Homer,Uh-huh...
Homer,Right...
Homer,Uh... I gotta think about this.
Homer,"Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight. I gotta get ready."
Homer,"That's great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?"
Homer,Sure they will.
Homer,Uh... I gotta go.
Homer,Yes I am.
Homer,"Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy."
Homer,"Lurleen, they loved you."
Homer,Is there anything you need?
Homer,My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
Homer,At least could I have my dollar ba...
Homer,I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family.
Homer,"Just so I don't wonder... You would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?"
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen. And I'll take any offer."
Homer,You son of a... Sold!
Homer,Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?
Homer,"Look Maggie, they have a baby, too."
Homer,Pfft.
Homer,Ooooh.
Homer,"Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton."
Homer,Lousy snitch.
Homer,I am not.
Homer,Hear hear!.
Homer,"Oooh, appetizers."
Homer,"Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!"
Homer,"Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?"
Homer,"Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love."
Homer,"Hey, Wiener Boy... Where do you think you're going?"
Homer,"Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it."
Homer,"Hey, down in front."
Homer,Come again?
Homer,To the Simpson mobile!
Homer,"Wow, my concert going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer."
Homer,Billy Beer!
Homer,"Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me."
Homer,I hear ya. Come on boy.
Homer,"Now, just meet me back here after the show."
Homer,"Boy, some of the best times I've ever had were in the back seat of a car."
Homer,"Oh, Baby!"
Homer,THERE WAS A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA... A RECORD STAR HE THOUGHT HE'D BE... HE HEARD OF SINGERS LIKE BEATLES... THE CHIPMUNKS HE'D SEEN ON TV... WHY NOT A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA? AND SO HE HID... INSIDE A DOG...
Homer,I'll be right back.
Homer,"Well, that's a waste of money. We already have a guitar."
Homer,This is real.
Homer,"Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow!"
Homer,"Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him."
Homer,"Marge, what were you thinking?"
Homer,"Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape."
Homer,Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.
Homer,"Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, ""Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?"
Homer,All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage.
Homer,Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think.
Homer,"That's better. Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?"
Homer,"Son, come here. Heh, heh, heh. Of course I'm not mad. If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch TV."
Homer,It doesn't matter.
Homer,Open up! Open up! I gotta go and no fooling.
Homer,That guy has gotta go.
Homer,That's it. He's outta here.
Homer,"I don't care. This is not ""Happy Days"" and he is not the Fonz."
Homer,"Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house!"
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,What the...
Homer,So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories.
Homer,This sucks. Where is that channel changer?
Homer,"Oh, eh, I'll give it a chance."
Homer,Chocolate...
Homer,"Ooh, sweet."
Homer,"I'd say ""You're a lying scumbag."" Why sweetie?"
Homer,"Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter."
Homer,"Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge?"
Homer,"Listen, Tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. What do you say to that?"
Homer,"Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety."
Homer,Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
Homer,"Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!"
Homer,Now there's a Machiavellian countenance.
Homer,Ooh...a sextet of ale.
Homer,Nah.
Homer,The vernal equinox?
Homer,Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! A pox on them!
Homer,"Marge, where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food."
Homer,Yuh. Yuh. Yuh.
Homer,Yeah that's good.
Homer,"Forgot there was a physical today, huh?"
Homer,Go to hell.
Homer,"Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough..."
Homer,Herb?
Homer,What the hell are you two...
Homer,"Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this?"
Homer,"Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?"
Homer,"Oh, goodbye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories."
Homer,Boring.
Homer,"Well friend, you're going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders' house."
Homer,"Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse."
Homer,That's right. There's no way my life could possibly get any worse.
Homer,Would I!
Homer,"Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it."
Homer,Don't I get some kind of trophy? At a big award ceremony?
Homer,Herb!
Homer,Please please please please please...
Homer,Don't jinx it!
Homer,"Oh, my God!! Woo hoo! I win!"
Homer,I miss my couch.
Homer,Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind.
Homer,I think I'm gonna take a walk.
Homer,"I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless."
Homer,Wow. The Spine Melter 2000.
Homer,Give me full power.
Homer,"Dammit, I said full power!"
Homer,I'll take it.
Homer,"Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer."
Homer,"All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky."
Homer,They're singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf.
Homer,You weren't so glad to see me.
Homer,"Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?"
Homer,"Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode."
Homer,On... off... on... off.
Homer,"Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know what this switch does."
Homer,They do good work.
Homer,"Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman."
Homer,"Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?"
Homer,Nah.
Homer,Twenty minutes?!
Homer,It's drinking the water!
Homer,This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!
Homer,It's going back for more!
Homer,"All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother."
Homer,"Okay, then just give me the drinking bird."
Homer,"Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks."
Homer,"I try, but I can't."
Homer,Never mind.
Homer,"I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something."
Homer,I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
Homer,"Well, when is he gonna act like it?"
Homer,"Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me."
Homer,"What do I get? What do I get? It's not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don't want it."
Homer,That's it?
Homer,"I see your point, brother."
Homer,All right... but I never really hugged a man before.
Homer,"Wake up, boy."
Homer,Well it is.
Homer,"Sure do. When you're eighteen, you're out the door."
Homer,"Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty."
Homer,"Son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. Now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers."
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,Stupid roller-skate.
Homer,"A+? You don't think much of me, do you boy?"
Homer,You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy.
Homer,"Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn't. But why should you pay for my mistake?"
Homer,Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
Homer,"Thanks son. Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?"
Homer,"Marge, am I crazy, or is my back getting hairier?"
Homer,"I don't see your name on it, boy."
Homer,Oh yeah?
Homer,Check... mate.
Homer,"""Leaves of 4, eat some more."""
Homer,Oh no you're not.
Homer,He-he-he.
Homer,"Marge, since the kids left, I lost five pounds!"
Homer,And look. New hair!
Homer,I'm this close to having a comb-over!
Homer,Size... right... agility!
Homer,"Ah, kids' letters from camp."
Homer,"Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here."
Homer,Sounds interesting.
Homer,Sounds interesting.
Homer,A beaut from Butte.
Homer,Nothin' could be finah.
Homer,"She, uh... Good for her."
Homer,Marge keep it down in there.
Homer,Maggie! Cut that racket!
Homer,And where exactly are you going?
Homer,"Well, this is the first I've heard about it."
Homer,"Excuse me, Marge. I think that if you told me I would remember! I mean I'm not an idiot!"
Homer,"Kids, back me up."
Homer,"Match point, Homer."
Homer,That's okay. We're none of us perfect.
Homer,"Bart, don't ask stupid questions. Is there any frontal nudity?"
Homer,Make Bart do it.
Homer,"You see, Marge, while you're off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too."
Homer,"Marge, your ride's here."
Homer,"Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine?"
Homer,"Hey, there's quarters in here!"
Homer,"Woo-hoo! Come to papa! Marge, I'll be out in the car."
Homer,"Marge, move it or lose it!"
Homer,Salt me.
Homer,Wha th... Why are you talking like that?
Homer,I'm livin' in a cuckoo clock.
Homer,"But Marge, what about dessert?"
Homer,Fine. I will!
Homer,"Oh no! My pudding is trapped forever. So I can open my own can of pudding, can I? Shows what you know, Marge!"
Homer,"Maaaarge! Hey, Maaaaaarrrrge!"
Homer,So what time does this play start?
Homer,"Well I gotta, don't I?"
Homer,Probably not much of it.
Homer,"Because I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects."
Homer,"You know, the painting class, the First Aid course, that whole Lamaze thing."
Homer,You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings. Good night.
Homer,"Maggie, time to go to the..."
Homer,Babies.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Kids, wait in the car. I want to talk to your mother about this play thing."
Homer,Shut up boy.
Homer,"Marge, you were terrific."
Homer,I wasn't bored. I was sad. It really got to me how that lady -- Uh... uh... you know which one I mean. You played her.
Homer,Yeah. How Blanche was sad and how that guy Stanley -- should have been nice to her.
Homer,I mean it made me feel bad. The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. At least that's what I thought. I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.
Homer,"Hey, you know. I'm a lot like that guy."
Homer,"Yeah, like when I pick my teeth with the mail and stuff..."
Homer,"Ahhh, another beautiful day in the womb. La-la-la-la--la-... ...la-la-la... la-la-la..."
Homer,Leggo! Leggo!
Homer,I'm all naked and wet!
Homer,Don' wanna go.
Homer,Too cold out!
Homer,"Oh, stupid itchy church pants..."
Homer,"One size fits all, my butt!"
Homer,Forget it. I'm not going.
Homer,"Ahhh. I'm just a big toasty cinnamon bun. I never want to leave this bed. Uh-oh. Gotta take a whiz. Think, man, think... think, think, think. I better get up."
Homer,I'm whizzing with the door open -- and I love it!
Homer,"Whyyy, oh whyyy... Delilahhh?"
Homer,You bet your sweet... ass!
Homer,I wear short shorts!
Homer,"The perfect chance to make my patented, space age, out-of-this-world Moon Waffles."
Homer,"Let's see here... caramels, waffle batter...liquid smoke..."
Homer,"Oooh, waffle run off."
Homer,"Mmm, fattening."
Homer,"Uh-oh. Here, boy."
Homer,"Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
Homer,I know that!
Homer,"Hello, this is Homer Simpson."
Homer,This Things I Believe.
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,Heh-heh-heh... Moe is their leader.
Homer,"Come on TV... gimme some of that sweet, sweet pap!"
Homer,"Oh, well... can't win 'em all."
Homer,Yesss!
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,Is that what I think it is?
Homer,I... found... a penny!
Homer,Could this be the best day of my life?
Homer,Looks like we have a new champion.
Homer,"Ah, my beloved family. How was church?"
Homer,"I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. And I owe it all to skipping church!"
Homer,"Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again."
Homer,"No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, yes."
Homer,"Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?"
Homer,And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?
Homer,And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.
Homer,"Marge, come to bed."
Homer,Maarge... come to bed Marge...
Homer,It's good for what ails ya...
Homer,I can wait all --
Homer,God?
Homer,Well... kind of... but...
Homer,And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17.
Homer,I'm not a bad guy. I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?
Homer,No. They moved to Phoenix.
Homer,You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.
Homer,Give him one for me.
Homer,"So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way."
Homer,"Sure, honey."
Homer,"Don't worry, Sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed."
Homer,"Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you."
Homer,"Guys, please, could you give me five minutes?"
Homer,"Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path."
Homer,"Yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special 'cause I usually dream about naked... Marge."
Homer,Perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way.
Homer,Yeah... think about it.
Homer,"Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson. I won't be coming in tomorrow -- Religious holiday... The uh, Feast of... Maximum Occupancy."
Homer,"Well, you should join my religion, Moe. It's great. No Hell... no kneeling...."
Homer,No sale.
Homer,Leave me alone!
Homer,Where are we going?
Homer,"Kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. He had long hair and some ""wild"" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. And that man's name was... I forget. But the point is... uh, I forget that too. Marge, you know who I'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --"
Homer,There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders... the water department... God...
Homer,Very sure.
Homer,"Ooh! An interview with Lorne Michaels... wait, that's no good. Hey, now we're talkin'. ""Our Unabashed Dictionary defines IUD as 'Love Springs Internal'."" I don't get it."
Homer,"Wait a minute, is this a religious thing?"
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"Apu, I see you're not in church."
Homer,"Hey Ganesha, want a peanut?"
Homer,"No offense Apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz."
Homer,"Boy, everyone is stupid except me."
Homer,"Marge, turn down the heat. That's better."
Homer,"Fire! What do I do? What do I do? Oh, the song! The song! WHEN A FIRE STARTS TO BURN / THERE'S A LESSON YOU MUST LEARN / SOMETHING... SOMETHING, THEN YOU'LL SEE/YOU'LL AVOID CATASTROPHE!"
Homer,"Flanders, you saved me. Why?"
Homer,"That's right, old friend."
Homer,"My Magazines and roach traps... gone, all gone."
Homer,"Hey, wait a minute... Flanders is a regular Charlie Church and God didn't save his house!"
Homer,"Well, the Picasso... my collection of classic cars..."
Homer,"Well, that's just great."
Homer,"You know, I have a feeling there's a lesson here."
Homer,"No, don't tell me, I'll get it... Oh, I know! The Lord is vengeful! O Spiteful One! Show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!"
Homer,"I was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that I am."
Homer,"I'll be there next Sunday. Front row, center!"
Homer,"God, I gotta ask you somethin'. What's the meaning of life?"
Homer,C'mon.
Homer,I can't wait that long.
Homer,"No, tell me now!"
Homer,"Ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!"
Homer,A ride on the Duff Blimp...
Homer,Wow.
Homer,"Ho-mer, Ho-mer, Ho-mer.."
Homer,"Oh, it's no fair. We'll never have a buffer."
Homer,"Well, I want that one."
Homer,Oh my God!
Homer,HEY THERE BLIMPY BOY /FLYING THROUGH THE SKY SO FANCY FREE.
Homer,"Honey, what's wrong?"
Homer,What are you talking about?
Homer,"Heh heh heh... Oh, Lisa, this isn't real. It's just how you might look if you were a cartoon character."
Homer,Now that's not true! You're cute as a bug's ear.
Homer,"Dad, am I cute as a bug's ear?"
Homer,"There, see?"
Homer,"Moe, have you ever felt unattractive?"
Homer,"How about you, Barney?"
Homer,I need help.
Homer,Lisa's age seven to nine!
Homer,That could be Lisa!
Homer,"Hey, Barney, will you give me 250 bucks for this blimp ticket?"
Homer,Where'd you get all the money?
Homer,"Lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be?"
Homer,"Uh, was your second wish to be entered in the Little Miss Springfield Pageant?"
Homer,"I sent in an application for you. I couldn't find a big enough photo, so I sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates."
Homer,But I think she'll win.
Homer,"Hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl."
Homer,"Well, if I could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, I would. But to me, she's beautiful."
Homer,Hey there blimpy boy Flying through the sky so fancy free --
Homer,"Boy, when Lisa comes in, I want you to make a big fuss over how she looks."
Homer,"No, she won't. When it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin' more, MORE! MORE! And if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return."
Homer,I'll tell you when you're older.
Homer,"Is that Lisa? Ooh, I gotta call heaven -- there's an angel missing!"
Homer,Hey... hey!
Homer,"Nope, that's it."
Homer,Yeah! Clean up this stink hole!
Homer,They'll love you just as much as I do.
Homer,Hmmm.
Homer,Bless you boys.
Homer,I know.
Homer,If it wasn't for me you'd still be queen. You must hate me.
Homer,I don't know. Was I drunk?
Homer,Really?
Homer,Will you remember this the next
Homer,time I wreck your life?
Homer,Oh yeah? With what?
Homer,"I mean don't worry, son. I forgot to get you a present. But I swear on my father's grave..."
Homer,I will get you one now!
Homer,Do you sell toys?
Homer,"Well, I need something for my son's birthday."
Homer,"Ooh, that's bad."
Homer,That's good.
Homer,That's bad.
Homer,That's good.
Homer,Can I go now?
Homer,"Happy birthday, son!"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Didn't even pull the string that time.
Homer,That doll tried to kill me!
Homer,Don't leave me alone with him.
Homer,MY BALONEY HAS A FIRST NAME / IS H-O-M-E-R / MY BALONEY HAS A SECOND NAME / IT'S H-O-M-E-R.
Homer,"Goodbye, Dolly."
Homer,And that is that.
Homer,"Marge, Marge, look!"
Homer,The doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me!
Homer,Ew. Dog water.
Homer,Come here you.
Homer,Did you walk the dog?
Homer,"Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk."
Homer,"... So then, his wife comes through the door!!!"
Homer,Did I mention she was dead?
Homer,"Well, she was. And she hit him in the head with a golf club!"
Homer,Don't you remember? He went golfing all the time and it really bugged her.
Homer,Ooo.
Homer,Did you wreck the car?
Homer,Did you raise the dead?
Homer,But the car is okay?
Homer,All right then.
Homer,"Why? Oh, the zombies. No."
Homer,Spare my family. Take me. Take me!
Homer,To the book depository!
Homer,He was a zombie?
Homer,I'm a-comin' boy!
Homer,"Barney! Not you, too!"
Homer,Take that Washington!
Homer,"Eat lead, Einstein!"
Homer,"Show's over, Shakespeare!"
Homer,Man... fall down. Funny.
Homer,Well that depends on what your teachers say. If you've been good... pizza. If you've been bad... uh... ... let's see... poison.
Homer,Oh no. I'm not making two stops.
Homer,"All right, I'll talk to Lisa's teacher this year. You can have Bart's."
Homer,All right. Tell you what. I'm thinking of a number between one and 50.
Homer,"I mean, no."
Homer,"Please Marge... please, please, please, please, please?"
Homer,Woo hoo! U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!
Homer,Hee hee!
Homer,I did. I did read to her!
Homer,"Eight o'clock... Happy Days. The Fonz, Henry Winkler, is worried he's losing his cool."
Homer,"Well, I've always been a firm believer in the three ""R's"": ""reading TV Guide""... ummmm, writing to TV Guide... and renewing TV Guide."
Homer,"""My child is on the Honor Roll at Springfield Elementary."" You know, I never thought I'd find a replacement for my ""Where's the Beef"" bumper sticker. Heh, heh, heh... ""Where's the Beef""."
Homer,Huh? Oh.
Homer,Bus-ted!
Homer,Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa!
Homer,Oh. That guy.
Homer,He's the boy you love to hate.
Homer,Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. What great men he would join. John Marshall... Charles Evans Hughes... Warren Burger... mmm burger.
Homer,If you don't start making more sense we're gonna have to put you in a home.
Homer,"Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on ""60 Minutes."""
Homer,"Dad, you and your stories... ""Bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""..."
Homer,"But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present."
Homer,"All right, all right. Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours."
Homer,"Bart, don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza."
Homer,Just promise me you'll try to be good.
Homer,Thataboy.
Homer,"Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked?"
Homer,"Hey you goats, get outta here!"
Homer,"Boy, you're going to have to be punished for this."
Homer,"Run along, ya little scamp."
Homer,Bart! Why are you doing that?
Homer,"Well, this time you must be punished."
Homer,"No tricks, boy. I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute..."
Homer,Ice cream truck!
Homer,"Me, me. I was here first!"
Homer,"Now, what were we talking about, boy?"
Homer,Oh yeah. The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
Homer,I'unno.
Homer,"All right. All right. Bart, go to your room."
Homer,How could you let this happen?
Homer,Oh. How convenient.
Homer,Can't he be both like the late Earl Warren?
Homer,Now who's being naive.
Homer,"All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I'll punish him and make it stick."
Homer,"Sorry, but the punishment stands."
Homer,"Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?"
Homer,"All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment I've ever handed down. And this time it's gonna stick!"
Homer,"Damn right. Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever!"
Homer,Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.
Homer,Hmm...
Homer,"YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY/ I'VE GOT LOVE IN MY TUMMY/ AND I FEEL LIKE LOVIN' YOU..."
Homer,"... LOVE YOU, SUCH A SWEET THING/ GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT THING..."
Homer,"Someday you'll thank me for this, son."
Homer,"No, it's true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt. But, my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage."
Homer,I like stories.
Homer,"I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it. You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV."
Homer,"I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that."
Homer,But then I won't be watching TV. You can see the bind I'm in.
Homer,Don't you think I know that?
Homer,"Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""Mister Tight Buns"" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen."
Homer,"No, son, we both won. You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special."
Homer,All right. I think you've learned your lesson.
Homer,I'll get it son.
Homer,Mmm... Soylent Green.
Homer,Which one's the mouse?
Homer,Itchy's a jerk.
Homer,"Oooh, give it here."
Homer,"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
Homer,I wish I could retire.
Homer,"Boy, that'd be sweet."
Homer,Can't talk -- busy.
Homer,All part of God's great plan.
Homer,The half-assed approach to foundation repair.
Homer,Ready!
Homer,"Hand me my patching trowel, boy."
Homer,Hmm.
Homer,No.
Homer,Wha-do I do...
Homer,Wait a minute...
Homer,Wait a minute...
Homer,Uh huh?
Homer,Did you see the bubble?
Homer,Forget it. You're not the only foundation guy in town!
Homer,"Let's see, foundation repair... Ah, here we are..."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. We only have five hundred in the bank. That leaves... eighty- hundred we need."
Homer,Hey! Then I could follow my dream. Living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
Homer,"March 15... I wish I'd brought a TV. Oh God, how I miss TV."
Homer,Bo-ring!
Homer,Bo-ring.
Homer,"Forget it Marge. We already live together; we shouldn't work together. As the Bible says ""Thou shalt not horn in on thy husband's... racket."""
Homer,"It's in there. Look, Marge we just don't need the money that bad."
Homer,Marge have you seen my lunch box?
Homer,"Marge, you're making a big mistake. I'm going to see you all day at work and all night at home..."
Homer,"And that's good! But, here's the bad part... uh... uh... Ooh, look at that headline: ""Canada To Hold Referendum."" Sorry Marge, can't talk now."
Homer,"Yeah, lemonade is good."
Homer,Wha dey do?
Homer,"Now, Marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt ."
Homer,Marge what're you doing? It's lunch time.
Homer,"Marge, Marge, Marge, let's file this under ""R"" for arrivederci."
Homer,"Don't worry, baby. That tube'll know what to do."
Homer,"Marge, get my gun."
Homer,You can't take our donuts!
Homer,"Oh, man, I really gotta..."
Homer,I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... Tibor... I never thought it'd be my own wife.
Homer,Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver.
Homer,"Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy. I'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... Eh, goodnight."
Homer,I've got a better idea -- get the hell out!
Homer,He left his briefcase. Hey! It's full of shredded newspapers.
Homer,"No! Mr. Burns, I'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife."
Homer,Damn right!
Homer,"Gotcha. Marge, we're gettin' some drive-thru then we're doin' it twice."
Homer,"Ooh, me too."
Homer,"Ahhh, bacon."
Homer,"Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh?"
Homer,Mmm... no.
Homer,Mmm... no.
Homer,"Wha... hey, moose! Shoo! Go! Talkin' to you! Get off my lawn! Now!"
Homer,"Hello, what's this? Wire hangers! Expired medicine! Old newspapers! Okay Homer, stay calm. Just quietly get this stuff inside your house."
Homer,"Homer, you're not listening!"
Homer,"Come on, Marge. Maybe I'm not getting enough ...estrogen."
Homer,"Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we're going to that restaurant."
Homer,"Mmmm, shrimp."
Homer,"There you are! Thought you could get away, huh?"
Homer,My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way.
Homer,"...All you can eat, ha!"
Homer,"Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels."
Homer,"No ""All You Can Eat Seafood."" I wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. Nothing!"
Homer,"Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around..."
Homer,"That's it! Whew, I'm glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing."
Homer,"Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we're not talking about food."
Homer,"Right. Me neither. We're talkin' about sex, right?"
Homer,I hear you loud and clear.
Homer,All you can eat. All you can eat.
Homer,Can't talk... eating.
Homer,"Hey, hey, hey!"
Homer,"But the sign said ""All you can eat."""
Homer,I'm gonna fight this thing.
Homer,"Sorry Marge, this is my quest. I'm like that guy -- that Spanish guy -- you know, he fought the windmills..."
Homer,"No, that's not it. What's his name? The Man of La Mancha."
Homer,No!
Homer,Fine. I'll look it up.
Homer,Never mind.
Homer,All right. Hit the change of venue button. Now!
Homer,So you think I have a case?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Uhh... can't you see I'm reading the uh...
Homer,"..._______ calendar? Hmm... Ooh, Mostly Mozart is in town."
Homer,"But Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did."
Homer,"Maybe you're right. Now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father."
Homer,"Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!"
Homer,"So I says, ""Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause I don't know where it is you baloney..."" You make me wanna retch..."
Homer,I married her!
Homer,"Thanks, that means a lot to me."
Homer,Hey!
Homer,Right here.
Homer,"Come on, Marge, let the people see your pretty face."
Homer,How someone someone abuse their body that way?
Homer,Moe! Don't throw out that brine!
Homer,"But Marge, Alan Thicke is throwing knives at Ricardo Montalban."
Homer,Ohh.
Homer,"Well, I got him as good as he got me."
Homer,It's a pornography store. I was buying pornography.
Homer,What country is this car from?
Homer,"Kids! If we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free."
Homer,Do you come with the car?
Homer,Bart! That car belonged to Bonnie and Clyde! Show a little respect.
Homer,The Batmobile!
Homer,"Adam West! Hey kids, Batman!"
Homer,Nice meetin' ya! Just keep moving. Don't make eye contact.
Homer,Wow! Just think what I could do with that plow.
Homer,"Mr. President, those young people are about to get a dose of reality."
Homer,"Eh, I can't afford it."
Homer,Well... I really should discuss this with my wife.
Homer,What? You think I'm going to buy a twenty thousand dollar truck just because you make that noise?
Homer,I'll take it!
Homer,"If you're gonna get mad at me every time I do something stupid, then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things."
Homer,Fine. I'll never ever do another stupid thing. Good night!
Homer,No.
Homer,Marge didn't reckon with these fliers and this flashy jacket.
Homer,"Dear Lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is KLONDIKE 5-3226."
Homer,"Not as low as my low, low prices."
Homer,"Uh, huh, that's Mr. Plow."
Homer,I'm gonna lose my plow.
Homer,Hmmm.
Homer,Almost time for our commercial.
Homer,"Alcoholics, the unemployable, angry loners..."
Homer,It may be on a lousy channel but the Simpsons are on TV!
Homer,Stop!
Homer,"Get out of here, you lousy... season!"
Homer,"Hello, I'm Mr. Plow. Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?"
Homer,Then call KLONDIKE 5-3226. Call now and receive a free T-shirt.
Homer,He could still surprise ya!
Homer,"Absolutely! My prices are so low, you'll think I've suffered brain damage."
Homer,"Shut up, boy."
Homer,So remember...
Homer,"CALL MISTER PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME! THAT NAME AGAIN IS MISTER PLOW!"
Homer,"Well, John Q Driveway has our number. Now we play the waiting game."
Homer,"The waiting game sucks. Let's play ""Hungry, Hungry Hippos."""
Homer,"Well wishing won't make it so. You've got to pull up your diaper, get out there, and be the best damn Barney you can be."
Homer,"How do you think he'll do, Moe?"
Homer,Cutting my nails? Brushing my teeth?
Homer,Oooh. Heh heh heh.
Homer,CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW.
Homer,"Ah, white gold."
Homer,What the... What happ... uh... oh no...
Homer,"Barney, you stole my idea!"
Homer,"How could you, Barney? After all I've done for you."
Homer,"Flanders, I thought I was your plow man."
Homer,Forget it pal. I don't need your phoney baloney job. I'll take your money but I'm not gonna plow your driveway.
Homer,Mr. West! You said there was a job for me!
Homer,"Ring, damn you. Ring!"
Homer,Mister Plow... that name again is Mr. Plow.
Homer,"Oh, you want the Mister Plow who plows driveways. This is Tony Plow. You know... from ""Leave It To Beaver""? Yeah, they were gay."
Homer,"Oh, what am I gonna do?"
Homer,I know! I'll do a rap. I'M MR. PLOW AND I'M HERE TO SAY: I'M THE PLOWINGEST GUY IN THE USA / I GOT A BIG PLOW AND I MOVE A LOT OF THINGS / LIKE YOUR COW IT YOU HAVE ONE.
Homer,All right.
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,I thought there was chocolate inside.
Homer,"Well, why was it wrapped in foil?"
Homer,Hmm...
Homer,Hello... Plow King? I was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding Widow's Peak.
Homer,"There's a $10,000 bill in it for you."
Homer,Uh... all of them. They're having a party. Jimmy Carter's passed out on the couch.
Homer,"Well, I guess he just doesn't respect his customers."
Homer,Kiss my asphalt.
Homer,"So I says, ""Kiss my asphalt."" Hmm? Hmm?"
Homer,This is all my fault. I've gotta save him.
Homer,"Hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat."
Homer,Easy... easy...
Homer,Barney!
Homer,"Barney, that's great. When two best friends work together, not even God, Himself, can stop them."
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,Oh yeah? How dumb do you think I --
Homer,You mean...
Homer,"MR. PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME. THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW. Our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on."
Homer,"Maggie, can you say ""daddy""? Dad-dy?"
Homer,"Did you hear that? She said ""burlap."""
Homer,Takes one to know one!
Homer,"Yeah, tell it, Mom."
Homer,WHEN THE WORKING DAY IS DONE / GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FU-UN / THAT'S ALL WE REALLY WANNNNT...
Homer,Homer is what grown ups call me. Call me Daddy.
Homer,Daddy.
Homer,Daddy.
Homer,Ye-esss...
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,He'll tire himself out soon.
Homer,"Heh, heh. Got your nose."
Homer,"Nooo! Bart, don't you ever do that again. Understand?"
Homer,We're gonna start doin' it in the morning?
Homer,Oh.
Homer,Marge that's...
Homer,"No, we won't. I've got it all figured out. The baby can have Bart's crib and Bart can sleep with us until he's 21!"
Homer,My cousin Frank did it.
Homer,"He became Francine back in '76. Then he joined that cult. I think his name is Mother Shabubu, now."
Homer,Mmmm. Hog fat.
Homer,Once we get these cats out of the way it won't be too bad.
Homer,Wow. How much? How much?
Homer,I can't afford that!
Homer,"Dad, I have a problem."
Homer,Are you done?
Homer,"Dad, I don't need advice, I need $15,000 to buy a home."
Homer,You didn't build this house. You won
Homer,it on a crooked '50's game show!
Homer,"Dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my family. I'd be honored if you came to live with us."
Homer,About three weeks.
Homer,Maggie I'll give you this cookie if you talk.
Homer,What? What?
Homer,"All right, you win round seven."
Homer,Your what-what?
Homer,"Eh, you don't want to hear that story. I know! I'll tell you about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr. Mooney. It was another one of my hair-brained schemes."
Homer,"Wait a minute. That was a ""Lucy"" show... Okay, where were we?"
Homer,Ah yes. I remember the day we moved in...
Homer,"Bart, I told you not to use that word. Call me ""Daddy."""
Homer,"Hi, Flanders."
Homer,I could use a TV tray.
Homer,Whaat?
Homer,"You said, anything."
Homer,"And that ""little while"" is now eight years and counting. Heh heh heh."
Homer,"Not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day."
Homer,Duh.
Homer,"All right, I know how to handle this. Just use a little reverse psychology. Let's go, Marge. Leave the baby with his little crib."
Homer,"Ah, Homer J. Simpson, you're a genius."
Homer,"I know you like clowns, so I made you this bed. Now you can laugh yourself to sleep."
Homer,"Patience, my pet."
Homer,Wow. A baby and a free burger. Could this be the best day of my life?
Homer,Yes!
Homer,"Shut up, Flanders."
Homer,Little Lisa. I've already started you a college fund at Lincoln Savings and Loan.
Homer,"Yeah, well Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt."
Homer,"Bart, there's someone in here who wants to meet you."
Homer,Where's the beef? No wonder he won Minnesota.
Homer,I like those odds.
Homer,"Please, please, please, please, please..."
Homer,"Can you say ""Daddy""?"
Homer,U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!...
Homer,"Here, Bart, you can hold my beer."
Homer,What?
Homer,"Goodnight, honey."
Homer,"Boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah."
Homer,"No, sweetie. ""Daddy."""
Homer,"Y'know, Maggie, the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back."
Homer,I hope you never say a word.
Homer,I can't wait till they throw his hatless butt in jail.
Homer,My heart is just fine...
Homer,Just workin' the turkey through. There it goes!
Homer,You know that feeling you get when a thousand knives of fire are stabbing you in the heart? I've got that right now. Ooh... bacon!
Homer,It could only be one thing.
Homer,What the hell is this?
Homer,"Ooh, oatmeal. What a delightful treat. Ugh, there's a bug in it."
Homer,Trust me.
Homer,Eh.
Homer,"Come on, come on!"
Homer,I keep hearing this horrible irregular thumping noise.
Homer,Whew! I was afraid it was my transmission.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,More.
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"Marge, my whole life flashed before my eyes."
Homer,FALL ON YOUR KNEES / OH HEAR THE ANGELS' VOICES /
Homer,"OH NI-IGHT, DI- Vine. Hey, my voice just changed."
Homer,"OH NIGHT, WHEN CHRIST WAS BORN..."
Homer,"But I'm out of the woods now, right? I mean, whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger."
Homer,"Hey, c'mon, quit it."
Homer,Stop. Please stop.
Homer,"Please, have mercy."
Homer,Not funny.
Homer,No! Remember your hippopotamus oath.
Homer,What an age we live in!
Homer,Hi.
Homer,"Woo hoo, look at that blubber fly."
Homer,"Say it in English, doc."
Homer,Spare me your medical mumbo jumbo.
Homer,Could you dumb it down a shade?
Homer,"Okay, okay. We need forty-thousand dollars. Now, how much do we have in the checkbook?"
Homer,"Hmm, have we deposited any forty-thousand dollar checks that haven't cleared yet?"
Homer,"Well actually, we gave it all up for a pinball machine in the lounge."
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. America's healthcare system is second only to Japan... Canada, Sweden, Great Britain. Well, all of Europe. But you can thank your lucky stars we don't live in Paraguay."
Homer,"Questions? Questions? Oh gee, my whole scheme down the... I mean, ask away."
Homer,"Oh, I thought that said, ""Brain Hemorrhages."""
Homer,I do enjoy a snifter of port at Christmas.
Homer,"Now let me tell you something, Mr. Sucker... I just..."
Homer,Oh. I...
Homer,Must... sign... policy...
Homer,"I made an ""H""."
Homer,"Looks like an ""X."""
Homer,Can I have a free calendar?
Homer,"Oh doctor, I was in a wonderful place filled with fire and brimstone. And there were all these guys in red pajamas sticking pitchforks in my butt."
Homer,I can't afford it. Maybe I should buy one of those machines.
Homer,"Oh yeah, that's the stuff."
Homer,"Now, I know I haven't been the best Christian. In fact, when you're up there ""Blah, blah, blah-ing"" I'm usually doodling or mentally undressing the female parishioners... well, anyhoo... can I have forty-thousand dollars?"
Homer,"Now, I know I haven't been the best Jew... but I rented ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and I will watch it. Anyway, can I have forty-thousand dollars?"
Homer,"Now, I know I haven't been the best... aw, forget it."
Homer,"No, but the rabbi gave me this."
Homer,"Son, they call it a ""droodle"". Whoo hoo! Look at him go!"
Homer,Bo-ring.
Homer,"Well, Marge, we could do worse."
Homer,Uh... some dog could do the operation.
Homer,"Kids, I have something to tell you."
Homer,Really? What's it like?
Homer,"Well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it."
Homer,So the tiny Aorta Fairies will take Mr. Leg Vein on a long trip to get married to Princess Left Ventricle.
Homer,"Uh, yeah."
Homer,Kids. Kids... I'm not gonna die. That only happens to bad people.
Homer,Uh... he sold poison milk to school children.
Homer,"Hey, I'm just trying to make it easier on 'em."
Homer,Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down.
Homer,Flanders? What are you doin' here?
Homer,Who are you donating them to?
Homer,I got a bad heart.
Homer,"Shut up, Flanders."
Homer,"Dear Lord, I'm really scared about this operation tomorrow. If something happens, please look after Marge, and make sure my kids grow up right."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down. Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down...
Homer,Bed goes up. Bed goes down...
Homer,"Krusty, why are you here?"
Homer,"Oh well, I could use a good laugh."
Homer,You seem okay.
Homer,"Gee, thanks, guys."
Homer,"Barney, I'm not getting a sex change!"
Homer,"Thanks, Moe."
Homer,"Oh, my little Maggie, I may never hold you again... ew, stinky pants."
Homer,"Now, Marge, if the unthinkable should happen, you're gonna be lonely..."
Homer,"Darn right. And to make sure, I want to be stuffed and put on the couch as a constant reminder of our marital vows."
Homer,"Bed goes up... Kids, I want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens. Let's see... uh... Oh, I'm no good at this."
Homer,"Bart, the saddest thing about this is I won't get to see you grow up, because..."
Homer,"I know you're gonna turn out great, with or without your old man."
Homer,And Lisa...
Homer,I guess this is the time to tell you...
Homer,You're adopted and I don't like you.
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"But don't worry, because you've got a big brother who loves you and will always look out for you."
Homer,Yabba dabba doo!
Homer,"SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE"
Homer,"Oh, Andy Capp, you wife-beating drunk."
Homer,"Like a giant billboard that says, ""No fat chicks""?"
Homer,Get to the money!
Homer,Bo-ring!
Homer,"Woo-hoo, look at that pavement fly!"
Homer,Heh-heh... mule.
Homer,Mono...
Homer,"Well, you should have written a song like that guy."
Homer,Maybe.
Homer,What's it to ya?
Homer,Does whiskey count as beer?
Homer,"Marge, I want to be a monorail conductor."
Homer,It's my life-long dream.
Homer,"Oh, yeah."
Homer,"Hmmm, false... No, wait. Maybe it's true."
Homer,"That's right, boy."
Homer,Heh-heh. Kids.
Homer,Do you want to change your name to Homer Junior? The kids can call you Hoju!
Homer,"""What if?"" What if I'm taking a shower and I slip on a bar of soap? Oh, my God, I'd be killed!"
Homer,We monorail conductors are a crazy breed. Half in love with death -- gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat peanuts... Am I turning you on?
Homer,What if I undo this button?
Homer,What if I talk like this?
Homer,What if I SING TO YOU? I GAVE MY LOVE A CHICKEN THAT HAD NO BONE/ Mmmm chicken.
Homer,"Who, me?"
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,"And this is the snack holder where I can put my beverage -- or, if you will -- cupcake."
Homer,THE WICKED WITCH.
Homer,I call the big one Bitey.
Homer,I call the big one Bitey.
Homer,I call the big one Bitey.
Homer,I locked my keys in there. Get a rock.
Homer,All aboard!
Homer,"Stick your head out the window, boy. It's the greatest!"
Homer,I'm trying my best.
Homer,I did it!
Homer,"Are we gonna die, son?"
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,Batman?
Homer,Batman's a scientist.
Homer,I'll take that.
Homer,Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?
Homer,"Yes, son. I'm the best mono-thingy guy there ever was."
Homer,Wowww.
Homer,"Bart, warm up the car. We're going to Duff Gardens."
Homer,"Now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?"
Homer,"And I'm a college student! Heh, heh."
Homer,But I wanna go to Duff Gardens. Right now!
Homer,I'm not pouting. I'm... mourning. Stupid dead woman.
Homer,"Ding-dong, the witch is dead."
Homer,Patty. Selma. I'm sorry.
Homer,Hey you don't hear Lisa complaining.
Homer,"Legend of the dog-faced woman! Oh, that's good."
Homer,What?
Homer,"All right, I'm almost there."
Homer,Please.
Homer,"Don't hassle the dead, boy. They have eerie powers."
Homer,"It's just not fair, dammit!"
Homer,All in favor of skipping the poem?
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"Uh, oh."
Homer,Sure... unless another aunt dies.
Homer,"Boy, I don't know. You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot."
Homer,I knew that.
Homer,Sand... wich...
Homer,I'll give it a good home.
Homer,Two more feet and I can fit it in the fridge.
Homer,Suggestion noted.
Homer,"Marge, I'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment."
Homer,Yes.
Homer,I don't care. I'm going to Duff Gardens.
Homer,S-s-o cold.
Homer,No! Duff... Gardens... hurrah!
Homer,But I love solids.
Homer,"This is all your fault! Oh, how can I stay mad at you?"
Homer,No. What are the odds of getting sick on a Saturday? A thousand to one.
Homer,Yentl? Whuzzat?
Homer,Sounds great!
Homer,"That Yentl puts the ""she"" in Yeshiva."
Homer,That's what you think .
Homer,The Erotic Adventures of Hercules.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Come to Homercles.
Homer,Homercles cares not for beans.
Homer,"Hi, kids. How was Duff Gardens?"
Homer,"You take an ordinary bed sheet, fold it around like this..."
Homer,I'm on my way!
Homer,"What'd ya say, Marge?"
Homer,"Hmm, I keep thinking I'm forgetting something."
Homer,I can't think with all this noise!
Homer,What am I supposed to do?
Homer,Pigabar? What the hell is pigabar?
Homer,Bart?... Bart!
Homer,Whyyyyy?!... Howwwww?!... Whennnn?!... Whichhh?...
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"Shut up, Flanders."
Homer,"Hey, boy. How was soccer practice?"
Homer,"Hey, Bart, son. Here's my way of saying, ""I'm sorry."""
Homer,"I know you're mad at me right now, and I'm kinda mad too... I mean, we could sit here and try to figure out ""who forgot to pick up who"" till the cows come home. But let's just say we're both wrong and that'll be that."
Homer,Bart's not mad at me.
Homer,"Marge, when kids these days say bad, they mean good. And to shake your booty means to wiggle one's butt. Permit me to demonstrate."
Homer,"It's that record club. The first nine were only a penny. Then they jacked up the price! It's not fair, it's not fair I tells ya."
Homer,Wasn't me.
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Homer,Hit me.
Homer,Hit me.
Homer,Hit me.
Homer,"Hey, boy! Where you going?"
Homer,Have a good time! Wait a minute.
Homer,So that's it!
Homer,"Hello, son. Where have you been?"
Homer,"No, you haven't! You've been out gallivanting around with that floozy of a bigger brother of yours! Haven't you, haven't you. Look at me."
Homer,"How would you like me to take it? ""Go ahead, Bart, have your fun, I'll be waiting for you?"" I'm sorry, I can't do it."
Homer,Uh... Revenge.
Homer,What the?
Homer,Ugly... wiener... crater face... Soo-ee! Soo-ee!...
Homer,"Ehhh, maybe this was a mistake."
Homer,I'll take him! Do you have him in blonde?
Homer,Pepi!
Homer,"Son, your life is gonna get better -- starting now."
Homer,"Oh, he is."
Homer,"Son, I just want you to know I love you very much."
Homer,Mmm... grapefruit.
Homer,I just press this button and the door opens like magic.
Homer,Because it's a stupid piece of junk!
Homer,"Well, I'd better get you home."
Homer,What's the matter?
Homer,"Well, there's... Jerry, the cowboy. And that big dipper-looking thing is Alan... the cowboy."
Homer,"""Learned,"" son, it's pronounced ""learned."""
Homer,"I love you too, Pepsi."
Homer,Pepi.
Homer,I gave it to Pepi.
Homer,He's my little brother. That's right -- you're not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization.
Homer,"Come on, Bart. We had our fun. Remember when I used to push you on the swing?"
Homer,Liar!
Homer,Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
Homer,No.
Homer,"Come 'n' get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Come `n get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Stupid dolphin."
Homer,Hey!
Homer,He's got my hotdog!
Homer,"Oh... it's you. So, you're looking well."
Homer,"For your information, I'm his father!"
Homer,That's right. And who might you be?
Homer,Look! There's another disadvantaged boy.
Homer,Oh. Right.
Homer,This is even more painful than it looks.
Homer,"Thanks, son."
Homer,Yeah?
Homer,"Sure, boy."
Homer,"First, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust. That's when it's time to kick some back."
Homer,And then when he's lying on the ground...
Homer,Kick him in the ribs...
Homer,"Step on his neck, and run like hell."
Homer,Happy... Valentine's Day!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Uh, kind of. Nobody makes a big deal out of Valentine's Day."
Homer,"What a nice idea, son. It's uh, upstairs on the second floor of our house. I'll just go get it."
Homer,"Apu, you gotta help me! I need a valentine's gift for my wife."
Homer,Perhaps this might be appropriate.
Homer,Yes! You saved my life. How much?
Homer,What? That's highway robbery! I won't pay it!
Homer,"Forget it, pal!"
Homer,All right. But I'll never shop here again.
Homer,Sold!
Homer,I'd sell my first-born son.
Homer,You'll do as your told.
Homer,"Ah, sweet pity. Where would my love life have been without it?"
Homer,"Let me handle this, Marge. I've heard 'em all. ""I like you as a friend,"" ""I think we should see other people,"" I no speak English""..."
Homer,"""I'm married to the sea,"" ""I don't want to kill you, but I will--"
Homer,"And if that doesn't work, six simple words: ""I'm not gay, but I'll learn."""
Homer,Can you believe Flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush?
Homer,Eww.
Homer,She's in the can. Go away.
Homer,Really?
Homer,"Yeah, they'll do that."
Homer,"Sure it is, honey. You do mean stealing, don't you?"
Homer,"Your conscience? Lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do."
Homer,"Oh, shaddup."
Homer,"Something wrong, officer?"
Homer,Where?
Homer,"You know, one day honest citizens are going to stand up to you crooked cops."
Homer,"C'mon, boy! Finish him off!"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Yeah, syrup is better than jelly."
Homer,"Where's your Science Fair project, boy?"
Homer,"Whelp, time to go to work."
Homer,"Roll in at nine, punch out at five. That's the plan."
Homer,Then to the Duff Brewery.
Homer,"I gotta think of a lie, fast."
Homer,"If the plant ye wish to flee, go to sector 7-B."
Homer,"To overcome the spider's curse, simply quote a bible verse. Uh, thou shall not..."
Homer,The man never drank a Duff in his life.
Homer,Like what?
Homer,Why not?
Homer,No.
Homer,Mmmm... Gummi Beer.
Homer,"Hey, Barney. I think you've had enough."
Homer,"Barney, give me your keys. You're too drunk to drive."
Homer,"Okay, you leave me no option."
Homer,I'm trying to knock you out.
Homer,Gulp.
Homer,"W,X,Y, AND Z / NOW I KNOW MY ABC'S / WON'T YOU COME AND PLAY WITH ME?"
Homer,"Your Honor, I'd like that last remark stricken from the record."
Homer,"Stupid bicycle. Can't believe this. No good, rotten..."
Homer,I guess it's not all bad.
Homer,"It's funny `cause I don't know him. Heh, heh, heh."
Homer,I'm here for the Alch-anon meeting.
Homer,My name is Homer and I'm just here because the court made me come.
Homer,So they say I might have a problem.
Homer,Does the Lord count as a person?
Homer,"Then, yes."
Homer,"Thank you, that'd be nice."
Homer,Do I ever!
Homer,Ah.
Homer,You name it.
Homer,You got it. No deer for a month.
Homer,Deer.
Homer,"All right. Starting tomorrow, no beer for a month."
Homer,"I was saying ""Pssst. I love you."""
Homer,"Well, beer... we've had some great times."
Homer,WHEN I WAS 17 / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER I PURCHASED WITH A FAKE I.D. / MY NAME WAS BRIAN MCGEE / I STAYED UP LISTENING TO QUEEN
Homer,WHEN I WAS 17.
Homer,Hm. Alcohol fueled car.
Homer,One for you... one for me... One for you... one for me...
Homer,One down. Twenty-nine to go.
Homer,"T.V. have you turned on me, too?"
Homer,I never realized how boring this game is.
Homer,I think I've lost weight.
Homer,I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer.
Homer,The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
Homer,Don't think about beer... Don't think about beer... Don't think about beer...
Homer,Nooooo!
Homer,Thirty days!
Homer,"Marge, I'm going to Moe's. Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm comin' back loaded."
Homer,"But Marge, the barflies are expecting me... Moe, and Barney and that guy who calls me Bill..."
Homer,Yoink.
Homer,"Moe, gimme a beer."
Homer,"Put it in the fridge, Moe. I got a date with my wife."
Homer,RAINDROPS KEEP FALLING ON MY HEAD...
Homer,"It's just a movie, son. There's nobody that evil in real life."
Homer,I hope they kill that Iron Yuppie. Thinks he's so big.
Homer,Don't worry. We won a dental plan in the strike of eighty-eight. That's where I got this scar.
Homer,Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito?
Homer,Then I got this scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet.
Homer,Thanks a lot Carl. Now I've lost my train of thought.
Homer,"If we give up our dental plan, I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces."
Homer,"People stop! We can't give up our dental plan! Lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth."
Homer,"And Gummy Joe, where would you be without the dental plan?"
Homer,You know what I think of this contract?
Homer,"Hey, what does this job pay?"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,And make life-long connections to the world of Organized Crime. Hmmm... organized crime.
Homer,Mmm. Gratzi.
Homer,Eh-Eh-Eh.
Homer,Molto bene.
Homer,That's-a-nice-a-donut.
Homer,"Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, Mr. Burns or me."
Homer,"Done and done! Heh, heh, heh."
Homer,"Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?"
Homer,"Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no."
Homer,Who is it?
Homer,Who?
Homer,Hired goons?
Homer,"You know, you could have just called me."
Homer,Hired goons?
Homer,"Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms."
Homer,Which way to the bathroom?
Homer,Nope. Nope. Nope.
Homer,Uh... yeah.
Homer,I'm gonna resign. I don't know why they made me Union President in the first place.
Homer,"Yeah, you're right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh..."
Homer,"Ya know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head."
Homer,"Fellow workers, I've been meeting with Mr. Burns day and night and I've had enough."
Homer,Who keeps saying that?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER...
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Woop, woop, woop! Woop, woop, woop!"
Homer,We're going back to work!
Homer,Haw haw. April Fool's.
Homer,"Haw, haw. April Fool's! I've been keepin' that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! Sucker!"
Homer,You talk better than you fool.
Homer,You couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine.
Homer,"Ahhh, what noble visionary thought up April Fool's Day?"
Homer,God bless those pagans.
Homer,Happy New Year!
Homer,And that's the story of April Fool's Day.
Homer,"Oh, right."
Homer,"Ah, beer. My one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will."
Homer,"Whew! It's a good thing that beer wasn't shaken up any more, or I'd have looked quite the fool. An April Fool, as it were."
Homer,So thirsty... Eh. What're you gonna do?
Homer,Mmmm... beer.
Homer,"ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT, GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM..."
Homer,Marge!
Homer,Arrrgh!
Homer,Arrrgh!
Homer,"Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God."
Homer,"I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --"
Homer,I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--
Homer,You guys must have been pretty worried about me.
Homer,"This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy."
Homer,Shhhh! Just watch.
Homer,"Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!"
Homer,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him."
Homer,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
Homer,"The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly."
Homer,"Thanks for coming to visit me, Moe."
Homer,No! No! Beer bring pain!
Homer,"Oh, Marge, what if I wind up as some vegetable, watching TV on the couch? My important work will never be completed."
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?"
Homer,Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.
Homer,I can't.
Homer,Mmm... chocolate.
Homer,Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
Homer,"Mmmm, chocolate."
Homer,"Can't breathe... sweet chocolate... cutting off air... ...Mmm, nuts."
Homer,"Oh, yeah."
Homer,Oof.
Homer,Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
Homer,I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
Homer,I thought maybe you...
Homer,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time."
Homer,No. Let me hear you play.
Homer,"Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?"
Homer,"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE..."
Homer,"OVER THERE."""
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,What the...
Homer,They're fine.
Homer,"Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave."
Homer,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave."
Homer,Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.
Homer,"Why, you little --"
Homer,This calls for a celebration. We're all going to Hawaii!
Homer,Gotcha! It's April Fool's for two more minutes!
Homer,Me lose brain? Uh-oh.
Homer,Why'd I laugh?
Homer,"Marge, it happened again!"
Homer,"Marge, I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom."
Homer,"Marge, I never graduated from high school."
Homer,"I never passed remedial science one ""A""."
Homer,"Marge, ixnay on the uclear-nay ecnitian-tay."
Homer,"I don't know. I flunked Latin, too."
Homer,"Ah, my high school yearbook..."
Homer,You handsome devil.
Homer,I can't believe I ate the whole thing.
Homer,"""Activities, none. Sports, none. Honors, none."" So many memories."
Homer,"It'll be great to see the old gang again... Potsy, Ralph Malph, ""The Fonz""..."
Homer,"No, they weren't all happy Days. Like the time Pinky Tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night I lost all my money to those card sharks, and my Dad, Tom Bosley, had to get it back."
Homer,"Look, there's Bobby Mindich, the class clown."
Homer,Richard Nixon.
Homer,I'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.
Homer,Hmmm.
Homer,"The guy's so high, he doesn't even know that's Dave."
Homer,"Homer's not here, man."
Homer,Ed Sullivan.
Homer,Oh my God!
Homer,I discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.
Homer,Yes!
Homer,What can I say? It hasn't been easy staying in my rut...
Homer,"Marge, I have my pride. I'm going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma, and get back my most improved odor trophy!"
Homer,"Bart, Lisa I have something to tell you, and I'm not proud of it."
Homer,I never graduated from high school.
Homer,"Oh, you have a job?"
Homer,I see.
Homer,"All right. But if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar."
Homer,Will this be on the test?
Homer,Nooooooo!
Homer,This is not happening. This is not happening.
Homer,True.
Homer,True.
Homer,False.
Homer,"All right, brain, you don't like me and I don't like you. But let's just do this and I can get back to killing you with beer."
Homer,Marge! I passed!
Homer,At our next high school reunion I'll have nothing to be ashamed of.
Homer,"Hello, Dondelinger."
Homer,Not me!
Homer,Hey kids. How was school?
Homer,That's my boy.
Homer,"Mmmm, beer... What?"
Homer,No son of mine is gonna be a 19th Century Cockney bootblack. We're gonna find you another school.
Homer,"Marge, it's too late. The boy's ten years old! Let's focus our energy on Lisa and the other one."
Homer,What's your problem?
Homer,Woo hoo! The greatest day of the year.
Homer,"Maybe so, Lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. Inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved."
Homer,"Look what I got, Marge. A new whacking stick."
Homer,Whack!
Homer,Whack! Whack! Whack!
Homer,"Yes, honey."
Homer,Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. Remember that?
Homer,Your Daddy hit the referee.
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Here you go. Official Whacking Day parking. Ten dollars per axle.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Well, Marge,"
Homer,should I whack slow or fast?
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Lisa, maybe if I'm part of that mob, I can help steer it in wise directions. Now, where's my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn?"
Homer,You mean there's a better way?
Homer,"Gotta get a juicer. Gonna drink juice, lose weight. Won't get chest pain from answering the phone anymore."
Homer,Oh my Juice Loosener's never gonna come.
Homer,Woo-Hoo!
Homer,My name is Mr. Burns.
Homer,"Marge, the boy's wasting valuable time -- come change the channel and pat my head."
Homer,"But, I'll miss ""Sheriff Lobo."""
Homer,I'll miss Sheriff Lobo...
Homer,I'll miss Sheriff Lobo...
Homer,Lobooo...
Homer,Lobooo...
Homer,"Look, Marge, I'll just talk to Apu and I'm sure he'll be reasonable."
Homer,"Apu, I'd like you to drop the charges against my wife."
Homer,"Now, come on! I'm your best customer."
Homer,Mmm... pie.
Homer,"Marge, I'm gonna miss you so much. And it's not just the sex... it's also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. But mostly, I'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning."
Homer,"Marge, please. I'm having enough trouble with the lobsters."
Homer,"Now kids, while your mother's gone, I don't wanna have to wash any dishes. So, from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton, and we'll eat while standing over the sink or toilet."
Homer,"We're gonna let her roam free in the backyard, and nature will take its course."
Homer,Go up to the attic. There's a whole trunk of clothes up there.
Homer,Uh... no.
Homer,"Honey, I don't know what you're feelin' right now. So I don't wanna push anything. We can just hold hands... or sit and talk..."
Homer,Woo!
Homer,He's dead now.
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,I figure it's some guy's name. Some guy named Gabbo.
Homer,I'll figure it out. I'm gonna use all the power of my brain.
Homer,He'll tell us what to do.
Homer,WITH MY...
Homer,"Two wrongs make a right, Lisa. Ah, Rex Morgan M.D., you have the prescription for the daily blues."
Homer,"Hey, Moe, can I look too?"
Homer,My wallet's in the car.
Homer,"Now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. You can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out."
Homer,"Oh, wait. That was the old sofa."
Homer,"Ooh, delicious."
Homer,"Ooh, five cents each!"
Homer,Junk... junk... the airplane's upside down... Strad-i-who-vius?...
Homer,"I'm surprised you don't remember, son. It was only eight years ago."
Homer,"Who cares? Anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of 1985... A maturing Joe Piscopo left ""Saturday Night Live"" to conquer Hollywood... People Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel...and I was in a barbershop quartet..."
Homer,Hello...
Homer,"Every afternoon at Moe's, Chief Wiggum, Principal Skinner, Apu and I would get together and sing... and the crowds went wild."
Homer,"Bart, what did I tell you?"
Homer,"Rock 'n' roll had become stagnant. ""Achy Breaky Heart"" was seven years away. Something had to fill the void, and that something was barbershop..."
Homer,GOODBYE...
Homer,SO GOODBYE...
Homer,Really?
Homer,Just leave it to me.
Homer,"Run along, boy. You're free now!"
Homer,"The next day, we started auditioning for Chief Wiggum's replacement..."
Homer,Get off the stage!
Homer,It was one lousy applicant after another. And then...
Homer,"Barney, how'd you like to sing for our group?"
Homer,The Be Sharps.
Homer,What'd you kids get?
Homer,"Far out, man. I haven't seen a bong in years."
Homer,"Well, one of us made some money. I sold a guy our spare tire."
Homer,"It'll be a long time before your Mother gets back with the tire, so why don't I tell you more of the story? Now that we had a name, the Be Sharps needed a hit. Something new, something exciting, something mid-1980's..."
Homer,THERE WAS NOTHING IN AL CAPONE'S VAULT / BUT IT WASN'T GERALDO'S FAULT --
Homer,Hmm... baby on board.
Homer,"BABY ON BOARD / SOMETHING, SOMETHING BURT WARD... This thing writes itself!"
Homer,Wait'll I tell Marge!
Homer,"Well... if I explain it to Marge that way, I'm sure she'll understand."
Homer,"Come on, honey. It'll only be till we finish our tour of Sweden."
Homer,"Yeah, but I'm not gonna let it change our lives. I'll be the same loving father I've always been."
Homer,I stuck him somewhere.
Homer,"Look what I got for you, Dad."
Homer,"We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. She's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons."
Homer,I meant the statue.
Homer,We had fame and fortune.
Homer,Now all we needed was the approval of record company low-lifes.
Homer,Then came the greatest thrill of my life.
Homer,Oh my God. Oh my God! Where did you get that brownie?
Homer,Oh man.
Homer,"Lisa, did you see the Grammys?"
Homer,"Well, you haven't heard the last of them."
Homer,"I miss you too, honey."
Homer,Oh. Thanks.
Homer,Here.
Homer,"They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. But if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. Bart!"
Homer,All the time. It was the title of our second album!
Homer,But we were about to learn an iron law of show business: What goes up must come down.
Homer,"Well, anyway, we were all getting tired of--"
Homer,Shut up!
Homer,"Hi, kids... I love"
Homer,"Meanwhile, the group was having problems of its own..."
Homer,I pity the fool who doesn't like... he. And wher's Barney?
Homer,Then came the day we knew we were finished.
Homer,Are we hot?
Homer,We all went our separate ways.
Homer,"Hey, fellas! I'm back."
Homer,I'll give her a good home.
Homer,And I did.
Homer,I'll never forget my five-and-a-half weeks at the top.
Homer,"There are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. Now off to bed."
Homer,"I'd like to thank you on behalf of the group, and I hope we passed the audition."
Homer,"Oh my god, someone's trying to kill me! Oh wait, it's for Bart."
Homer,"Oh. I wrote that one, after Bart somehow put this tattoo on my butt."
Homer,It's probably the person you least suspect!
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"If you don't mind, we're trying to watch the mov..."
Homer,Oh no!
Homer,"Is that so? Oh, Flan-ders! Won't you join me in my kitchen?"
Homer,Go home.
Homer,"Woo hoo! Did you hear, Bart? Oh."
Homer,Ooh! I wanna be John Elway.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Whup, two against one!"
Homer,This isn't just because of Sideshow Bob. It's a chance to turn around all our stinking lives.
Homer,"Shut up, boy."
Homer,"Ooh, Ice Creamville."
Homer,Check.
Homer,I got ya.
Homer,No problem.
Homer,I think he's talking to you.
Homer,EVERYTHING IS A SOURCE OF FUN...
Homer,Lousy speed bumps.
Homer,Ew. This coffee's too hot.
Homer,"Hey, kids! Wanna drive through that cactus patch?"
Homer,"Wow, a houseboat! You know, the great thing is if you don't like your neighbors, you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else."
Homer,"I tied him up, out back."
Homer,"Relax, Marge. I tied up all the loose ends before we left."
Homer,Aaah...
Homer,Bart! Don't interrupt!
Homer,Oh it is not.
Homer,BARTDOYOUWANTSOMEBROWNIESBEFORE YOUGOTOBED?!
Homer,"C'mon, let me cut you a brownie while they're still hot."
Homer,"Why? Oh, right. The Sideshow Bob thing. Sorry, boy."
Homer,Nope.
Homer,BARTDOYOUWANNASEEMYNEWCHAINSAWAND HOCKEYMASK?
Homer,Sorry. What am I thinking?
Homer,"Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies."
Homer,"Aw, no fair."
Homer,"Oh, geez, I told you, Bernie. To guard the bee."
Homer,You guys are pathetic. No wonder Smithers made me Head Bee Guy.
Homer,The bee bit my bottom. Now my bottom's big! Oh!
Homer,What the hell are you talking about?
Homer,What do I do!? What do I do!? In the name of God you've got to tell me!
Homer,Just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go.
Homer,"Must destroy mankind! Ohh, lunch time."
Homer,So you want me to go to college?
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"Maybe you're right. I did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way."
Homer,That dog has somebody's ham! This I gotta see!
Homer,"C'mon! Gimme the hand, you stupid dog! C'mon! Gimme' that!"
Homer,"Is ""TV Guide"" a book?"
Homer,Son of Sniglets??
Homer,"Katharine Hepburn's ""Me""?"
Homer,I suck.
Homer,... it was the most I ever threw-up and it changed my life forever.
Homer,"Thanks boy. Now, for the crowning touch..."
Homer,"Relax, a photo can't make any difference."
Homer,"Sorry, son, but there's a program about campus life that I really should watch."
Homer,I hate that lousy dean!
Homer,"Yes! Take that, Bitterman!"
Homer,Woo hoo! A flyer for a hardware store!
Homer,Something I should have done a long time ago...
Homer,"No, ma'am."
Homer,"Woo hoo, I'm a college man! I won't need my high school diploma anymore."
Homer,I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART. S-M-R-T...I MEAN S-M-A-R-T.
Homer,My first day of college. I wish my father was alive to see this.
Homer,How long have you been back there?
Homer,Nerd!
Homer,"Marge, try to understand. There are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time."
Homer,"Hey pal, did you get a load of the nerd?"
Homer,I'll be a campus hero...
Homer,"Marge, someone's squeezed all the life out of these kids. And unless movies and TV have lied to me, it's a crusty, bitter, old dean!"
Homer,"Boy, I can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt."
Homer,Hold me.
Homer,"You see that, sir. Drops his notes."
Homer,Do we have to?
Homer,Then kiss my curvy butt goodbye!
Homer,"Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus. Besides, it isn't costing us - I swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site."
Homer,"Uh, excuse me ""Professor Brainiac,"" but I worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, I think I know how a proton accelerator works."
Homer,"All right, I will."
Homer,"In there, guys."
Homer,"Yeah, you've won this round, Dean. But the war isn't over."
Homer,"Hello, Dean? You're a stupid head."
Homer,"Hiya, gang!"
Homer,"Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor..."
Homer,"Heh heh. ""Nee."""
Homer,We played Dungeons and Dragons for three hours. Then I was slain by an elf.
Homer,You take that back...
Homer,Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy.
Homer,"Oh, not Souter... Oh, no."
Homer,I'll write it on my hand...
Homer,"C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!"
Homer,We're gonna go out and par-ty!
Homer,"Aah, the college road trip. What better way to spread beer-fueled mayhem?"
Homer,"But Marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good..."
Homer,"I'm telling you, a big crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered. The Dean'll go nuts!"
Homer,"I got it! We wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge."
Homer,Those bastards...
Homer,And then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.
Homer,What?
Homer,"Look! You pull its tail straight and it curls right back up again. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight..."
Homer,"Of course he does. He's a cute little piggy. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly..."
Homer,Ow! Why you little...
Homer,"Guys, believe me, I didn't mean to get you expelled..."
Homer,"Hey, that's not the wallet inspector."
Homer,"Marge, they don't have anywhere to stay, and they're geniuses. They'll solve all our problems. They'll elevate us to the status of kings on Earth."
Homer,"Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. Right, Marge?"
Homer,Absolutely. Now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.
Homer,I got it! We're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.
Homer,Perfect.
Homer,"Well, dean, I'm really sorry for the running-you-over prank."
Homer,And all those other pranks were my idea too. I'm the one who should be expelled.
Homer,"Yes, you have."
Homer,"No problem, guys. The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends."
Homer,"Exam?!? Oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams."
Homer,"Actually, I've been working on a plan. During the exam, I'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out."
Homer,Whatever. Either way is good...
Homer,I'm gonna lose my job just 'cause I'm dangerously unqualified.
Homer,Computers can do that?
Homer,Mora wuza?
Homer,"Oh, let's just say I had help from a ""little magic box..."""
Homer,"Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college."
Homer,Oh. Then I learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.
Homer,"Hmmm, true."
Homer,"Oh, Marge. You're worse than that crusty old dean."
Homer,"Well, I guess it's back to college for me. And that means it's time to... What did I teach you guys?"
Homer,Yes.
Homer,Lobo! Lobo! Bring back Sheriff Lobo! Lobo! Lobo!
Homer,Oh no! Burns' Birthday!
Homer,Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.
Homer,Ow. Ow. Ow. Missed me. Ow!
Homer,Not funny. And the one in my pants really hurt.
Homer,Hee hee! I'm so funny! This is gonna be great.
Homer,I'm writing a delicious send up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poo poo one word or two?
Homer,"Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. I paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants."
Homer,Now I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...
Homer,"Lisa, don't spoil our fun!"
Homer,"Okay, stupid!"
Homer,"Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. Hey Flanders, you smell like Manure!"
Homer,Are you ready to laugh?
Homer,I said are you ready to laugh?!
Homer,"You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap..."
Homer,I mean... you know... Mr. Burns... is so... old...
Homer,"Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky."
Homer,"I'm Mr. Burns. Blah, blah, blah. Do this. Do that. Blah, blah, blah."
Homer,"I think I'm so big. Blah, blah, blah."
Homer,"Blah, bla..."
Homer,Unghhhh!
Homer,"Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again."
Homer,"Don't worry, boy. He'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday."
Homer,"Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down."
Homer,Moldy!?! Old!?!... I'm gonna get something to eat!
Homer,Right. That makes sense.
Homer,No! Lemme go!
Homer,How long have we had these fish? Wait! The bear! Burns' bear!
Homer,"Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio."
Homer,"Two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun..."
Homer,Yes. We'll send the eye.
Homer,Yes sir. Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.
Homer,"Sorry, Burns. No deal."
Homer,I gotta call Burns! I gotta call Burns. Maybe I can still get that drink!
Homer,I knew you'd come crawling back.
Homer,"A million dollars and three Hawaiian Islands. Good ones, not the leper ones."
Homer,Woo hoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya. Here you go.
Homer,It seems to be stuck. Bad baby! Bad Maggie!
Homer,"Here you go, Maggie."
Homer,"The deal's off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here."
Homer,"Ah, big deal. Who needs his money? We're gettin' by okay."
Homer,Hmmm. Sixty-four slices of American cheese.
Homer,Sixty four... sixty three...
Homer,I think I'm blind.
Homer,Right here.
Homer,My life can't get any worse.
Homer,After lunch can I whip you?
Homer,"Maggie, I know you like the bear... but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... this box!"
Homer,See Maggie? See the fun box! Do do do do doo do...
Homer,Do do do do doo...
Homer,No! My box! My box!
Homer,"Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money."
Homer,"Aw thanks, Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul."
Homer,Box...
Homer,I can see why this is so popular.
Homer,That's right.
Homer,"Oh, Barney, leave me alone."
Homer,"Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out, Smithers!"
Homer,I love this show
Homer,"Well well, look whose come to apologize."
Homer,"But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear. It's Maggie's."
Homer,"Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?"
Homer,"Oooh, pure genius..."
Homer,Oh. Pure genius. And now to make the leap from dreams to reality.
Homer,All right. Stay calm. Remember your training.
Homer,"Dear Homer, I.O.U. one emergency donut. Signed, Homer. Bastard. He's always one step ahead. Oh, I'd sell my soul for a donut!"
Homer,Flanders! You're the devil?
Homer,Do you have a donut or not?
Homer,"Hey, wait. If I don't finish this last bite, you don't get my soul, do you?"
Homer,I'm smarter than the de-vil! I'm smarter than the dev-
Homer,"Not likely. Heh, heh."
Homer,Mmmm... forbidden donut.
Homer,No.
Homer,"Eh, that wasn't so bad."
Homer,"Uh, huh."
Homer,More. Mmmm.
Homer,No.
Homer,Woo hoo! Ow!
Homer,"But I'm so sweet and tasty. Well, time to go to work."
Homer,"Marge, look at all this great stuff I found at the marina! It was just sitting in some guy's boat!"
Homer,Hey boy!
Homer,They're dogs! And they're playing poker!
Homer,"Heh-heh-HEH. Lisa, vampires are make-believe. Just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos."
Homer,Hmmm... business deal.
Homer,It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us for a midnight dinner at his country house in... Pennsylvania.
Homer,Sure did.
Homer,"Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer."
Homer,It was the boy!
Homer,"Huh, ooooh, punch!"
Homer,Correction. Free blood.
Homer,Ahhh.
Homer,"Oh, Lisa, you and your stories. Bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells. Now let's go back to that... building... thingee... where our beds and TV... is."
Homer,Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sist... Wait a minute! You are a vampire.
Homer,Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American Dream?
Homer,Super Fun Happy Slide!
Homer,I guess killing will be fun enough.
Homer,"Take that, vile fiend!"
Homer,"Oh, sorry."
Homer,You have to kill the head vampire.
Homer,What the hell's so funny?
Homer,Stupid TV. Be more funny.
Homer,"Heh, heh, some idiot actually called in!"
Homer,"Marge, it's public TV! They never have anything good. Where are the Geraldos? Where are the Eubankses-es?"
Homer,The ballet? Woo hoo!
Homer,"Marjorie, please. I enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew. Ahhh, ballet."
Homer,"All right, but remember it's mine."
Homer,That's what ballet is?
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum."
Homer,"Heh, heh, heh. It was worth it."
Homer,I can't. I gotta take my wife to the ballet.
Homer,Mmmm... invisible cola.
Homer,"Heh, heh. Time to stick it to the man."
Homer,"Phht, that's just an old wives tale."
Homer,Errrrghh... just...a little more. Got it!
Homer,I'm stuck! Help me!
Homer,Must... get to ballet...
Homer,promised Marge...
Homer,Hello? Can I get some help? Snack related mishap!
Homer,"Mmmmm, candy."
Homer,"Marge, this may be hard to believe, but I'm trapped inside two vending machines."
Homer,I'm going to have these things on my arms forever!
Homer,Candy and sodas for all!
Homer,Mmmm... convenient.
Homer,"They'll grow back, right?"
Homer,Your point being?
Homer,"Marge, I know you didn't believe me about the vending machines. That's why I had the fireman write me a note."
Homer,Lumber has a million uses.
Homer,"Marge, that's twice. I think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman."
Homer,"Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk! Oh look, it's doing it again!"
Homer,"Marge, you can't go out on Saturday. That's our special night."
Homer,"What the... Oh, I don't know... a little show called ""Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman""?!"
Homer,Where you going?
Homer,When will you be home?
Homer,Where you going?
Homer,Will you bring me back something?
Homer,"How can you do this, Marge? How can you desert your children?"
Homer,"Man's best friend, indeed."
Homer,I can't believe your mother went out to have fun without me.
Homer,"Oh, that would be delightf... Quiet, boy! There's nothing to feel ashamed of here. Women have a right to a night out. Right, Lisa?"
Homer,That's it! I'm calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.
Homer,Fine! I can have a great time all by myself!
Homer,"Oh Lisa, haven't you seen ""Home Alone?"" If some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation."
Homer,Wait a second...
Homer,You kids do need a baby-sitter.
Homer,Here you g... Nnnnnno.
Homer,We pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two Popsicles out of the freezer.
Homer,Two.
Homer,Done.
Homer,Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name.
Homer,Hi guys!
Homer,"Moe, get the darts. I want to play."
Homer,"Ooooh, ""Jet!"""
Homer,Woo hoo! It's Garret Morris' birthday.
Homer,Come on Marge. It's fun to smash things. I smashed it good!
Homer,You got real purdy hair.
Homer,"Ah, young love."
Homer,The old make-out place. Hey! A new weather station. I'll bash it good!
Homer,It's just no fun without Marge.
Homer,My wife's having a girls' night out.
Homer,"I miss you, Marge."
Homer,A lot of blue hair? Heh-heh. What a freak.
Homer,"It's Marge! She's become a crazed criminal, just because I didn't take her to the ballet."
Homer,Really?
Homer,That's them!
Homer,Oh my God. They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault!
Homer,Marge! Marge!
Homer,"Look, Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband. I'm sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub. I'm sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car... And I'm sorry... Oh well let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point."
Homer,"But please Marge, don't drive into that chasm!"
Homer,"Solid waste, I could kiss you."
Homer,"Mmmmm... Ewwww.... Mmmmm...Ohhh... Mmmmm... Ahhhh. Ooh, I think this was pizza."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Heh. Heh. Stupid animals.
Homer,"Ahh, the daily newspaper."
Homer,Oooh! The Springfield Men's Shelter is giving away sixty soiled mattresses!
Homer,OH MY GOD!
Homer,Tram...Ample...Een! Tram...Baple...Een!
Homer,"Oh no, you don't! That trampoline is MINE."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Krusty!
Homer,Yeah. What's the deal?
Homer,And I can just haul it away? Free?
Homer,"Hi, son. Hi, son. Hi, son."
Homer,"Marge, it's the perfect exercise. It'll double the value of our house. And it was free. FREEEE!!"
Homer,Absolutely! And this is just the beginning! I've got some big plans.
Homer,No it doesn't!
Homer,"Kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump."
Homer,"Okay, okay. I'll take care of it."
Homer,"All right, all right! I'll get rid of the trampoline!"
Homer,"Hey, Krusty! I'm bringing back the..."
Homer,There we go.
Homer,That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.
Homer,"Yep, it's finally gone."
Homer,"If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now."
Homer,I'm thirsty.
Homer,"Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline."
Homer,"All right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust."
Homer,Rust I tell ya.
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,"Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things. If it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!"
Homer,Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
Homer,That's not fun!
Homer,"See, Marge?"
Homer,"What up, Marge?"
Homer,"Marge, can I go outside and play?"
Homer,And that sends me into a shame spiral.
Homer,"Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now."
Homer,And I feel that you hear my shame.
Homer,I feel validated by that.
Homer,Me too.
Homer,"Wow! For free, ""SURPLUS DRUMS OF MAYONNAISE FROM OPERATION DESERT STORM."""
Homer,"Oh Marge, you and I are fine now. Who needs Brad Goodman?"
Homer,"Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture."
Homer,"I just thought I'd remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar."
Homer,It sure does!
Homer,"Thank you. Very, very much."
Homer,This is great. I can finally look like I want and not get hassled by the man.
Homer,"Hey, I hear ya, buddy."
Homer,"Hey, boy! In here!"
Homer,"Hold on, son."
Homer,"So long, suckers!"
Homer,"No, we're not."
Homer,"Ah... boy, if only Bart had been a better role model for everyone."
Homer,That's what I've been saying. We're all fine the way we are.
Homer,"Oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time."
Homer,"Ah, McGarnigal. Eases the pain."
Homer,"It means he gets results, you stupid chief."
Homer,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Homer,"Ah, finally a little quiet time, to read some of my old favorites."
Homer,"""Honey roasted peanuts. Ingredients: salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings."" Mmmmm."
Homer,Steak?
Homer,Steak?
Homer,Ah! The last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers.
Homer,Uh oh. Something's wrong.
Homer,"Ow, pointy. Eww, slimy. Uh-oh, moving. Ah-ha!"
Homer,"Oh, twenty dollars. I wanted a peanut."
Homer,Explain how.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Mmmmm... free goo.
Homer,"Marge, don't discourage the boy. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals. Except the weasel."
Homer,"Well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons."
Homer,"You're right, Marge. Good work, boy."
Homer,Egghead likes his bookie wook!
Homer,Just tucking him in.
Homer,"Oooh, floor pie."
Homer,Hmm.
Homer,BART!!!! Mmm... apple.
Homer,"Dah, I am the captain. My son is Bart."
Homer,"How was jerk practice, boy? Did they teach you how to sing to trees and build crappy furniture out of useless wooden logs? Huh?"
Homer,Stupid poetic justice...!
Homer,Heh heh. You don't have a son.
Homer,"I don't want to go, so if he asks me to go, I'll just say yes."
Homer,"Shut up, brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-tip."
Homer,"Bart, I'd be delighted to go on your trip with you!"
Homer,I'll take it.
Homer,Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders.
Homer,You are not my son.
Homer,"Uh, I dunno. But lucky for you somebody here is responsible."
Homer,"Hey, there's a new Mexico."
Homer,So many Krustyburger locations.
Homer,"Wrong again, Flanders."
Homer,"In a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land."
Homer,SUGAR. DO DO DO DO DO DO AWWW. HO--NEY. HO.....NEYYY. DO DO DO DO DO DO. / YOU ARE MY CANDY GIRRRRL Lousy piece of junk!
Homer,Now I have to face stupid reality again!... Flanders! My socks feel dirty! Gimme some water to wash 'em!
Homer,"Oh pardon me, Mr. Let's Ration Everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? Don't you know the poem? ""Water, water everywhere/ So let's all have a drink."""
Homer,Ohh... What does it matter? We're doomed!
Homer,"Woo-hoo! See that, boy? Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! In your face, Flanders!"
Homer,"Well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, I'll just be in charge of the rationing."
Homer,"Observe, boy. The secret is to take tiny bites, like so:"
Homer,Why couldn't I be on one of the smart rafts. I bet they're having the time of their life.
Homer,"This ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, Flanders. This is the Real Thing..."
Homer,"All right, well that's okay. When they come to rescue him, they'll rescue us."
Homer,Flanders! Snap out of it!
Homer,It's better to be safe than sorry. Sorry.
Homer,You'll thank me when we're frying up a big juicy fish.
Homer,He'll be back.
Homer,"Here fishy, fishy, fishy. We're waiting."
Homer,"Son, there's something I was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it now."
Homer,I stole it from that Borgnine guy.
Homer,Thanks boy. Now be careful when you...
Homer,The foul stench of death is upon us. Mmmm... hamburgers.
Homer,According to this map there's a Krustyburger on an offshore oil rig!
Homer,Never mind the fog! That way. Steer! There isn't much time!
Homer,Give seven hundred Krustyburgers!
Homer,Go away. Eating.
Homer,"Watch this, guys."
Homer,And we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain.
Homer,I mean... you know if we wanted to... not that I... ever did.
Homer,Hi.
Homer,Gotta go.
Homer,What the hell was that? I probably shouldn't have eaten that packet of powdered gravy I found in the parking lot.
Homer,"Yeah. Another day, another box of stolen pens."
Homer,You too. No goose bumps. No hallucinations. That last time was just a fluke.
Homer,"So uh, what do you guys think of Mindy?"
Homer,Yeah. That Mindy seems real nice.
Homer,Mindy has a motorcycle.
Homer,"Moe, I need your advice."
Homer,"See, I got this friend named... Joey Joe Joe Junior... Schabadoo."
Homer,"Oh, what the hell, it's me. I'm attracted to another woman. What am I going to do?"
Homer,Barney. That is so insightful. How did you come up with that?
Homer,"Uh, so. Let's have a conversation. Uh, I think we'll find we have very little in common."
Homer,"Hey, my favorite, raspberry swirl with a double glaze."
Homer,"Okay, so we have one thing in common. But you know what I hate? Drinking beer and watching TV."
Homer,Me too.
Homer,"Foul temptress! I'll bet she thinks Ziggy's gotten too preachy, too."
Homer,I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
Homer,I mean hello!
Homer,"That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator."
Homer,That's unsexy.
Homer,Ew.
Homer,"Well, this is my floor."
Homer,Arr - see ya tomorrow.
Homer,"Ah, home to my loving family. What more can a man ask for?"
Homer,Uhhh.
Homer,"Hi, son. Howya... ewww."
Homer,"Yeah, good."
Homer,"Let's have a little quality time together, just you and me."
Homer,Hey! We haven't watched TV in awhile.
Homer,Hello hotline? I am very tempted by another woman.
Homer,Nooo!
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,Sir Isa-who?
Homer,Col. Klink! Did you ever get my letters?
Homer,"Hee, hee, hee, hee. Did you know Hogan had tunnels all over your camp?"
Homer,"Ooh, I would live in a big mansion?"
Homer,"I, as well. Are you happy, Jeeves?"
Homer,Then we're all happy.
Homer,Marge lives here?
Homer,"OH MINDY, YOU CAME AND YOU GAVE WITHOUT FLAKING. BUT I SENT YOU BEN-GAY, OH ANDY, YOU KISSED ME AND STOPPED ME FROM SOMETHING, AND I..."
Homer,Uh oh.
Homer,"Um, because I have a small role in a Broadway musical. It's not much, but it's a start."
Homer,Like what?
Homer,"Lisa, look out behind you!"
Homer,"No, Lisa, I swear to you. I'm one-hundred percent completely serious. You've got to turn around right now before it's too late."
Homer,Sucker.
Homer,"Mindy, because of our uncontrollable attraction, I think we should avoid each other from now on."
Homer,Mindy!
Homer,Oh no! I'm sweating like Roger Ebert.
Homer,"Uh, Murphy, you are elf a controllably I think a we nam- myo-renge-kyo."
Homer,"Oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced. Colonel Klink, why have you forsaken me?"
Homer,Heh heh heh. Did you know Kinch had a radio in the coffee pot?
Homer,"Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it."
Homer,Free mouthwash! Free shampoo! Free shower curtain!
Homer,Mindy?
Homer,"Yeah. Uh, walls are a necessity in today's society. Heh heh."
Homer,"Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation."
Homer,Oh!
Homer,"Oh. Something's missing. Ooh, one of the turkeys fell behind the bed."
Homer,Mmmm... foot long chili dog.
Homer,It's a sign!
Homer,Go to hell!
Homer,"Heh, you know, I was a little worried about coming to this convention with you, but I think as long as we're not alone together..."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Is there any way to get out of this?
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,Well I guess you'll want to come in.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Yeah, yeah."
Homer,Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.
Homer,Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
Homer,But they're so sweet.
Homer,"Well, maybe I want to. But then I think about Marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. Sometimes I'd just like to..."
Homer,"Oh, baby."
Homer,Mmmm... Marge.
Homer,"OH, MARGIE, YOU CAME AND YOU FOUND ME A TURKEY, ON MY VACATION AWAY FROM WORKEY..."
Homer,"Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day."
Homer,Anybody lose their glasses? Last chance. Woo hoo!
Homer,The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining sides.
Homer,"Lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do."
Homer,And you know what the best part is? We've really done something for the children.
Homer,Shhh. I'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.
Homer,"I got a job at Burns' casino. As you know, it's been my lifelong dream to become a blackjack dealer."
Homer,We got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on fire.
Homer,"Uh, let's see... 18... 27... 35. Dealer busts. Looks like you all win again."
Homer,"Why thanks, Senator! Oop, looks like my shift is over."
Homer,"Hey, Marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, I bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino."
Homer,"Strike three, Marge. I remember that meeting, and I have a photographic memory."
Homer,Y'ello?
Homer,And then I said to the president... get this Marge? Marge?
Homer,Twenty- one? Do that card-counting thing again! Come on. Do it again.
Homer,"No! Please, please, please, please, please..."
Homer,No!
Homer,"Marge, you waited for me."
Homer,"Okay, Marge, let's go."
Homer,"Marge, I'm taking the car."
Homer,This late? Through the bad neighborhood?
Homer,Marge...
Homer,"Wait. I see what's happening here. You're just mad because everyone in this town loves gambling except for you. Well, that's just sad."
Homer,"You've gotta improvise, Lisa. Cloves, Tom Collins Mix, frozen pie crust."
Homer,"Ah, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to... Let's go see Mom."
Homer,"Marge, we need to talk. You're spending too much time at the casino, and I think you may have a problem..."
Homer,Woo hoo! Problem solved!
Homer,Huh? Wuh? Lisa? What's up?
Homer,"Aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all about it."
Homer,Boogeyman?! You nail the windows shut! I'll get the gun!
Homer,"Bart, I don't want to alarm you, but there may be a Boogeyman or Boogeymen in the house!"
Homer,"Oh, nothing, Marge. Just a little incident involving the Boogeyman. Of course, none of this would've happened if you'd been here to keep me from acting stupid."
Homer,Aw. Just like on TV.
Homer,"Lisa, your mom still loves you. It's just that she has a career, now. She's a slot jockey."
Homer,"It's always something isn't it? First, I have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this."
Homer,Ow...ow...ow...ow.
Homer,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
Homer,"Oh yeah, the costume."
Homer,"Hello, Floreeda."
Homer,"No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. I call him Gamblor. And it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws."
Homer,Marge! Where are you?! Damn this casino! Damn this casino!
Homer,Can't talk now.
Homer,You broke a promise to your child.
Homer,"You promised Lisa to help her with her costume. You made her cry, then I cried. Then Maggie laughed. She's such a little trooper."
Homer,"Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem."
Homer,"No no, that's too expensive. Just don't do it anymore."
Homer,Can't talk. Robbed. Go hell.
Homer,"You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage, I can finally look down my nose at you. You have a gambling problem."
Homer,Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears?
Homer,"Well, that's nothing, because you have a gambling problem! And remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like Santa Claus?"
Homer,"Well, you have a gambling problem!"
Homer,"Aw, what a gyp."
Homer,And remember when I...
Homer,Oh yeah. I forgot already.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Eh, that's no big loss."
Homer,"Oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em."
Homer,"Shhh, quiet Lisa."
Homer,"Curse you, Magic Beans."
Homer,"Hello, police? Are you sitting down? Good. I wish to report a robbery!"
Homer,Let me check my reason list.
Homer,Yep. It's on here.
Homer,"Alright, these are our new family security rules: Be home before dark, and make sure you're not followed, lock all doors and windows."
Homer,"Marge, they're only human."
Homer,"Oh Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone. I got you another instrument."
Homer,"Lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down."
Homer,"Aw, honey. I didn't realize how much that horn meant to you. Don't worry. Daddy's gonna get it back. I don't know how, but I'll figure out something."
Homer,"You know Lisa, music helps daddy think."
Homer,I dunno. Can you swing a sack of door knobs?
Homer,I'm someone else!
Homer,"We don't need a thinker, we need a doer. Someone who'll act without considering the consequences."
Homer,"Sorry, Dad. You're too old."
Homer,"Aw, Dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man now, and old people are useless. Aren't they? Aren't they? Huh? Yes they are. Yes they are..."
Homer,"Marge, we're responsible adults and..."
Homer,... and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms in a responsible way...
Homer,"Okay, we've got the secret vigilante handshake. Now we need code names. I'll be ""Cueball."" Skinner can be ""Eightball"", Barney will be ""Twelveball,"" and Moe, you can be ""Cueball."""
Homer,"No, we're forming a vigilante group."
Homer,Put this in your pipe and smoke it.
Homer,Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo!
Homer,"Woo hoo, hoo! Take that Maynard G. Krebs!"
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"Okay, men, it's time to clean up this town."
Homer,"You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big."
Homer,"Bart, give me that megaphone of yours."
Homer,Never mind the commercials. Just give it to me. I've got to whip this neighborhood into shape.
Homer,Move along there.
Homer,Return to your homes and places of businesses!
Homer,"Hey you, where'd you get that saxophone?"
Homer,Get him!
Homer,No burning leaves without a permit!
Homer,Too late.
Homer,"You better have a good reason for doing that, boy."
Homer,You're in. Here's the sack.
Homer,"So I said to him, ""Look buddy, your car was upside down when we got here. And as for your Grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that."""
Homer,I 'unno. Coast Guard?
Homer,"Lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas."
Homer,Literacy programs... preserving our beloved covered bridges... world domination...
Homer,"Oh, that might be a typo."
Homer,"Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that."
Homer,"Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes."
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,Uh... Marge?
Homer,Why you monster! And you have my daughter's saxophone too!
Homer,Oh sorry. I'm a little nervous.
Homer,"Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the Springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time."
Homer,We'll be right back.
Homer,"Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. Just stand around and don't steal anything."
Homer,Hey!
Homer,He'll show.
Homer,It's his job.
Homer,He's a burglar.
Homer,"Well, Mr. Cat Burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? There's just one little problem. Thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named Homer J. Sim -- Oh my God! Underage kids drinking beer without a permit!"
Homer,Asleep at the switch! I wasn't asleep! I was drunk!
Homer,"Well, no matter what the paper says, I still have a job to do."
Homer,Nooooo!
Homer,"Oh, this doesn't work any more."
Homer,I didn't say stop.
Homer,"Aw, Dad, I could kiss you."
Homer,No wait! I know where the burglar is!
Homer,"So, Mr. Molloy. It seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him."
Homer,"Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa."
Homer,I caught the cat burglar. I caught the cat burglar. That means you. You are the cat burglar.
Homer,Shut up.
Homer,No kidding.
Homer,"Well, I guess I'll be going to my home now and... sleep."
Homer,Lemme through! I gotta find a Big T. There's millions of dollars buried under a Big T!
Homer,It's mine!
Homer,"""Frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden treasure. I have already used this time to escape from your jail. Fondest wishes."" Oh, I can't make out this signature."
Homer,We'll dig our way out!
Homer,"Ahh, the morning horoscope. ""Today will be a day like every other day."" It just gets worse and worse."
Homer,"Yeah, you kids gotta go to school. I gotta go to work. The only one who has it easy is Marge."
Homer,"Buzz off, Giuseppe."
Homer,"Just a minute! Don't hang up! Y'ello... you'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel."
Homer,What do you mean you lost him?! He might have fallen into one of these machines!
Homer,Oh my God! That's his lucky red hat!
Homer,He's a box! My boy's a box! Damn you! A boooxxx!
Homer,"Marge, I have some horrible, bone chilling news."
Homer,"Oh, nothing."
Homer,That's not a job. It's a waste of time. What can poor people pay ya? Nothin'! What satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? None! Who wants to help poor people anyway? Nobody!
Homer,Why not? I remember my first after-school job. I was in a band.
Homer,"Hello, everybody. I'm Archie Bell and I'm also the Drells. We got a new song called, 'Tighten Up' and this is the music you tighten up with."
Homer,"Yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man."
Homer,"Gig, son. When you're a musician, a job is called a gig."
Homer,"It's okay, son. Who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? You're doing what you want to do with your life. Nothing else matters."
Homer,"Yep, well, that's what got me where I am today."
Homer,"There, there."
Homer,Ah. Oliver North. He was just poured into that uniform.
Homer,"Come on, Lisa. Say something funny."
Homer,"Oh, something stupid like Bart would say. Bucka bucka or woozle wozzle. Something like that."
Homer,"Aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing about Urkel... that little snot. Boy I'd like to smack that kid."
Homer,What the hell are you readin' books for?
Homer,"Don't forget to say ""I didn't do it""."
Homer,How do you figure boy?
Homer,"All right, but after Leno I'm all laughed out you know."
Homer,That dog can sell anything.
Homer,What kind of catchphrase is that?
Homer,Woo hoo! Cheap meat!
Homer,"Oooh, this one's open!"
Homer,"Oh, stomach churning... Bowels clenching... Not much time. Must finish."
Homer,Your old meat made me sick!
Homer,This shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Ooh. Rancid meat attack. Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?
Homer,Bor-ing.
Homer,"Shhhh, Lisa. The dog is barking."
Homer,"No way, man No way, man. Get yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire."
Homer,"Oh, that I'll wear."
Homer,"Don't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not wearing the hat."
Homer,Bee? Aah!
Homer,One hot dog please.
Homer,"It's true, it's true. We're so lame."
Homer,"No, don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware! I WAS UNAWAAARE!"
Homer,Oh.
Homer,You're selling what now?
Homer,You can't sell that. Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.
Homer,Is he still out there?
Homer,What? That's your job. If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping...
Homer,"Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chipwich, okay?"
Homer,"Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to try new things. For instance, tonight I'm using a... Apu, what do you call this thing again?"
Homer,Outrageous.
Homer,"Uh, I like to keep a lollipop there."
Homer,Pass the chutney.
Homer,That's even worse than the album Grampa released.
Homer,Well you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.
Homer,Ub. Apu friend me good.
Homer,That's okay.
Homer,THAT KWIK-E-MART'S A REAL... .
Homer,Everything really wrapped up nicely. Much quicker than usual.
Homer,And we've all found happiness... Every one of us.
Homer,"Hey, what's that sound?"
Homer,"Hey, he's not happy at all. He lied to us through song. I hate when people do that."
Homer,"I'm coming with you. I got you fired, it's the least I can do... Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing. But I'll go you one better and come along."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,I'm aware of that.
Homer,Are we in India yet?
Homer,Are we in India yet?
Homer,Are we in India yet?
Homer,Are we in India yet?
Homer,This isn't very convenient.
Homer,Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
Homer,Really?
Homer,You?
Homer,Well that was a big bust... is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
Homer,"No need to apologize, Apu. It was as much my fault as it was yours."
Homer,"Okay, Apu, I accept your apology."
Homer,"Fine. Oh, I mean not good."
Homer,"Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead."
Homer,"Hey, let's all hug Apu."
Homer,"Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them."
Homer,"Look, Maggie! It's Sgt. Thug's Mountaintop Command Post, complete with Death-bringer missiles that really launch!"
Homer,"Ah, come on, Marge, you're way too..."
Homer,"ONE, TWO, THREE O'CLOCK, FOUR O'CLOCK ROCK. FIVE, SIX, SEVEN O'CLOCK, EIGHT O'CLOCK ROCK!.."
Homer,"ROCK! ROCK! ROCK! ROCK-A, ROCK, ROCK! ROCKAROCKROCK!"
Homer,"WE'RE GONNA ROCK, GONNA ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK TO-NIGHHHTTT!"
Homer,"Thank you, thank you very much!"
Homer,"Marge, that's what I bought it for!"
Homer,Yes. But there's more.
Homer,"Dad, I love you, but: you are a weird, sore-headed old crank and nobody likes ya."
Homer,And we can't watch Fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in Syria.
Homer,"I'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. Everyone listens to me! No matter how dumb my suggestions are."
Homer,How about me?
Homer,I'unno.
Homer,"Marge, Lisa, Lady -- If you'll excuse me, I've got something very important to attend to."
Homer,Hey.
Homer,"Hello. Well, today's the day for Homer J. I know I'm gonna win this time."
Homer,"Union rule twenty-six - ""Every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor."""
Homer,Inanimate huh? I'll show him inanimate!
Homer,Stupid carbon rod. It's all just a popularity contest.
Homer,Nobody respects me at work.
Homer,"What, what does it say? I want to see."
Homer,"Ah, TV respects me. It laughs with me, not at me."
Homer,Boring.
Homer,"No, the batteries!"
Homer,Make it stop!
Homer,I can't! I can't!
Homer,"Hello, is this NASA?"
Homer,"Good. Listen, I'm sick of your boring space launches. Now I'm just an ordinary blue collar slob, but I know what I likes on TV..."
Homer,Shut up. And another thing - how come I can't get no Tang 'round here? And also... hold on a second.
Homer,"Hello, is this President Clinton? Good. I figured if anyone knew where to get some Tang it'd be you... shut up!"
Homer,"No. It wasn't me, I swear. It was... him."
Homer,"Respect?! Nooo! It was me! I made the crank call. I do it all the time. Check with the FBI, I have a file. I HAVE A FIIIIILE."
Homer,"I'll field this one. The only danger is if they send us to that terrible Planet of the Apes. ...Wait a minute, Statue of Liberty... That was our planet. You maniacs! You blew it up! Damn you! Damn you all to hell."
Homer,I'll take care of this.
Homer,And may the best man win. He's got a big drinking problem - could embarrass the program. Meet me up in that tree later and I'll tell you more.
Homer,Less shame?
Homer,Who's doin' what now?
Homer,"Well here I am, right on time. I don't see Barney ""Let's-crash-the-rocket-into-the-White-House-and-kill-the-President"" Gumbel."
Homer,"Aw, that's nothin'. Watch this. There once was a man from Nantucket"
Homer,I can't stands no more.
Homer,Mmmmm. Mediciney.
Homer,"Ahem... I uh... don't think this contest is over yet, Buzz. If that is your real name. I believe there Is still a little something called the swimsuit competition."
Homer,You mean I shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
Homer,"Congratulations, Barney."
Homer,Default? Woo hoo! The two sweetest words in the English language. De-fault! De-fault! De-
Homer,Nooooo!
Homer,"Marge, I don't really want to go through with this... But being an astronaut is how I got you to respect me."
Homer,Oh.
Homer,Ants!
Homer,"You're right, Marge. Just like the time I could've met Mr. T at the mall. The entire day, I kept saying, I'll go a little later, I'll go a little later.' And then when I got there, they told me he just left. And when I asked the mall guy if he would ever come back again, he said he didn't know. Well, I'm never gonna let something like that happen again. I'm going into space, right now."
Homer,Are we there yet? I'm thirsty.
Homer,It's beautiful. It's the most awe inspiring sight I have ever seen.
Homer,"... giver of life, mother of us all."
Homer,"Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard."
Homer,Wow! Former president James Taylor.
Homer,And that is that.
Homer,No!
Homer,Wait a minute Race! Wait a minute. Wait!...Ah-ha! Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours.
Homer,Stupid bar.
Homer,I'll bash you good.
Homer,"OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ CRISPY CRUNCHY GRAHAM CEREAL BRAND NEW BREAKFAST TREAT."
Homer,Stupid rod. I got gypped.
Homer,"Yeah, maybe I do have the right... what's that stuff? Anyway, thanks, Marge, Lisa."
Homer,"See because of me, now they have a warning."
Homer,Woo hoo! Sold!
Homer,"What do you mean? It says right here: ""Free wig with every purchase of large wig. Downtown Wig Center."" Why you little... Hmmm... Free wig."
Homer,"I love you, Homey. Heh, heh, heh. I don't need her at all anymore."
Homer,"Heh-heh-heh, I did it. Second in line and all I had to do was miss eight days of work."
Homer,"In theory, yes. Jerk."
Homer,Get tickets. Must get tickets. Find phone. Yes!
Homer,Oh stupid sheep.
Homer,"Not Flanders. Anybody, but Flanders."
Homer,I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE...
Homer,Excellent guitar riff.
Homer,Why am I such a loser? Why?
Homer,"Heh, heh, heh. Yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. But they didn't have the guts."
Homer,"God, if you really are God, you'll get me tickets to that game."
Homer,"Why do you mock me, oh Lord?"
Homer,I know I shouldn't eat thee but... Mmmm... sacri-licious.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Y- No.
Homer,"Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game with you."
Homer,"Well, yeah."
Homer,Duck! I can't let the boys see me with you!
Homer,Hi.
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"Hey everybody, here comes fun!"
Homer,Heh heh. Ow.
Homer,"Well, I guess I should pay my share..."
Homer,"Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat. Thanks, Ned."
Homer,"NACHO, NACHO MAN / I WANT TO BE A NACHO MAN."
Homer,"If anyone can pull it off, it's Stan ""The Boy"" Taylor."
Homer,"We won! We won! Flanders, we won!"
Homer,"Losers! Losers! Kiss my big Springfield behind, Shelbyville!"
Homer,I am invincible! Invincible!
Homer,Ow!
Homer,"Hey, somebody sign an autograph. Please, somebody!? Sign an autograph. Hey, would you sign... You fat, stupid jerks!"
Homer,It was him!
Homer,You know Stan Taylor?
Homer,Professional athletes. Always wantin' more.
Homer,"Wow, thanks. Now I have four children. You will be called ""Stitch-face."" Wow, Flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me."
Homer,No! I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders... my friend!
Homer,"Marge, quit livin' in the past."
Homer,I'll be there. And this time you can be the nacho man.
Homer,"Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese."
Homer,Now you got a law suit on your hands. Just kidding.
Homer,Boring. Let's watch something else.
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Hey what gives? I thought you had a satellite dish.
Homer,"Aw, Uncle Homer. Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, I want you to get to know my family."
Homer,Hey everyone!
Homer,"I'd like to introduce Ned Flanders, my best friend."
Homer,Can't talk... see Flanders... later sex.
Homer,"Hiya, Flanders! Oooh... dinner! May I join you?"
Homer,"Oh, yeah. A judge made me do that once, too. Stupid lack of public urinals. Hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, I'm comin' with ya."
Homer,But... all right.
Homer,C'mon! We've been here for fifteen minutes. Can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?
Homer,"Ah, for some reason, Moe's is always closed on Wednesdays."
Homer,"Come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. Oh, I can do it faster that that."
Homer,"Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe."
Homer,"Love, Marge. Don't hate. Love."
Homer,"The Flanderses are not geeks! Okay, Rod and Todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. But we've got to give this thing a chance. I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend."
Homer,Yes way.
Homer,"Don't worry, I brought my Rappin' Ronnie Reagan tape. It always makes the trip go faster."
Homer,"Ha, ha. You know something, he did say 'well' a lot."
Homer,"More. No, no, keep comin'. More... more... right there! Let her go!"
Homer,"Okay, let's go boating!"
Homer,They're fine.
Homer,"I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders. If this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the Flimpsons."
Homer,"So, here's to my best friend, Ned."
Homer,Food fight!
Homer,Whatcha doin'?
Homer,Okay. But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin!
Homer,Too late.
Homer,"Humph, your car. Boy, what are the odds, huh?"
Homer,"Marge! I think I hate Ted Koppel. No wait, I find him informative and witty. 'Nite."
Homer,"Hey, what's up for today, Neddie?"
Homer,"Right, no reporters."
Homer,O-okay.
Homer,"Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt."
Homer,Neddie? NEDDDDIEEE!
Homer,Hmmm. Guess he didn't see me.
Homer,"Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-ass seats."
Homer,I live to give.
Homer,"Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He's a wonderful, kind, caring man. Maybe even more so than me. There have been times when I've lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. But this man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for heaven. We'd already be there."
Homer,"Right back atcha, buddy."
Homer,Now how 'bout that game at the Pitch 'n Putt?
Homer,"Guess what, everyone?! My great uncle Boris died and left us his old country house. There's only one catch they say - it's haunted. But I'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there."
Homer,"Get lost, Flanders."
Homer,"See, I told ya. There's nothin' to worry about. This place isn't..."
Homer,"Hi, Mom."
Homer,"I'd love to honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today."
Homer,"Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. It's how drunk you get."
Homer,"Push her down, son."
Homer,"Oh dear God, no."
Homer,I call the basement.
Homer,All done.
Homer,"Are you mad, woman? You never know when an old calendar might come in handy. Sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? And these TV Guides... so many memories."
Homer,"""Gomer upsets Sergeant Carter."" Ooooh, I'll never forget that episode!"
Homer,Shazam.
Homer,What's the point of all this cleaning? Are we so vain?
Homer,Use only in a well ventilated area.
Homer,"Shove it, buddy."
Homer,Nothing.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,Y'ello?
Homer,He's taking the elephant instead of the money.
Homer,"Heh, heh. Stick it to the man. No, wait!"
Homer,"We'll call you back! Bart! With ten thousand dollars we'd be millionaires. We could buy all kinds of useful things, like... ... love."
Homer,"Lisa, go to your room."
Homer,Wee!
Homer,"Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore."
Homer,"Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory Communism works. In theory."
Homer,What's he yelling about?
Homer,Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry.
Homer,"Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So excuse me if I'm cruel."
Homer,"Now I've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth."
Homer,Shut up.
Homer,"Plants, eh?"
Homer,"Hey, any more arboretums around here?"
Homer,That bird! He's killing the elephant! Stop him!
Homer,"Grooming him, eh?"
Homer,I know. He's grooming me. Mmm... elephant fresh.
Homer,"Hey, what's with them?"
Homer,"Oh. Good luck. Look at these bills. ""Chain for elephant,"" ""Shots for elephant""... ""Oversized decorative poncho""."
Homer,Well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.
Homer,"Then that's what I'll do, smart guy."
Homer,"For the ninth time, no!"
Homer,"Wait a minute, this gives me an idea."
Homer,"I don't have time to read. Just give me the gist of it, son."
Homer,Your kid flew five feet. That counts as a ride. Two bucks.
Homer,"Look at this, Marge! Fifty-eight dollars! And all of it profit! I'm the smartest businessman in the world!"
Homer,"Marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money."
Homer,"Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once. Right?"
Homer,"Well, that was under our old price structure. Under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. Now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me."
Homer,This town is full of deadbeats. We can't afford this elephant.
Homer,"Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him."
Homer,"What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it?"
Homer,He likes peanuts.
Homer,"I only have two questions. How much, and give it to me."
Homer,"So, your bid is zero."
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low."
Homer,"Don't worry, son. I'll get you a new elephant."
Homer,Done.
Homer,Here's the keys.
Homer,I'll just keep these then.
Homer,He took Bart too?
Homer,"That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't PAAAAART!!"
Homer,Piece of cake. All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
Homer,Stupid tornado. look. It got Patty and Selma.
Homer,"Elephant, honey. It's an elephant. And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano."
Homer,"Son, you're okay! And you've led us to the precious ivory. And of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to..."
Homer,Forget it. That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
Homer,I'd like it fine.
Homer,"Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that? To be part of the Music Scene..."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out. First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out."
Homer,Now I'll pull my arms out with my face...
Homer,I'm alive! I'm alive. And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
Homer,"Oh, I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my life. And, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him."
Homer,"On the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products."
Homer,All right. We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
Homer,Mmm. Caramel.
Homer,Lousy job. Nothing exciting ever happens.
Homer,Woo hoo! What do I get?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Hey, this isn't such a great prize. Oh, well, this may be a dirty job, but the big guys at the top work even harder."
Homer,"That's it, boy. You're our last hope."
Homer,"Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. Just read it and you're a shoo-in."
Homer,Oooh. He card reads good.
Homer,"It's KURNS, stupid!"
Homer,Disregard.
Homer,The boot kicked Bart. It kicked him right in the butt.
Homer,"There sure is. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Right in the butt. That was great."
Homer,"Woo hoo! We're rich! Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. We want to get the old people smell out before we move in."
Homer,"Huh? Oh, right. So I guess you're in okay shape, huh? No heart problems or anything..."
Homer,Boo!
Homer,"Oh, yeah. So good..."
Homer,"Yeah, let's push him down the steps."
Homer,How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?
Homer,Okay. Lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.
Homer,That was the end piece. That's it! Being abusive to your family is one thing but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. Go to your room!
Homer,"Bart, you listen."
Homer,My secret shame.
Homer,"Bart, you're coming home."
Homer,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst."
Homer,He locked the door! I'll show him.
Homer,You idiot! He was the most talented one!
Homer,"Can I keep him anyway? Huh, huh?"
Homer,"Hey, the trail of donuts ended. Bart!"
Homer,"I'll miss you, son."
Homer,"Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV saying we didn't want you in our family. But those were just actors playing us."
Homer,Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
Homer,"Right back atcha, son. Aw."
Homer,"And now I want you to meet your new brother, Hans Moleman."
Homer,"Give it a try. It's like kissing a peanut. Heh, heh, heh."
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. They let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?"
Homer,"Well, I'm off to work."
Homer,"But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement."
Homer,"Look! Ree, ree. Ree, ree. Aye, aye. All right, all right, I won't take the dog. C'mere."
Homer,"How many ""s""'s in ""innocent""?"
Homer,"Yes, deeply concerned."
Homer,That is true.
Homer,I can't let the boy see me skipping work.
Homer,"How do you do, sir?"
Homer,Sucker.
Homer,Jury duty. I'll see that Quimby kid hang for this.
Homer,"I know you can read my thoughts, boy. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow/ meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,All right.
Homer,"Okay, fine."
Homer,What does sequestered mean?
Homer,What does deadlocked mean?
Homer,"Uh-huh. And ""if""?"
Homer,"So ""if"" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be ""deadlocked"" and have to be ""sequestered"" in the Springfield Palace Hotel."
Homer,"Where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free HBO - Oooh, ""Free Willy!"""
Homer,"Uh, how are the rest of you voting?"
Homer,I'm only doing what I think is right. I believe Freddie Quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.
Homer,"Oh, I miss you too, Marge. But the law needs me. I'll be home as soon as I can."
Homer,Room service? Send up two more pot roasts and three more pillows with mints on 'em.
Homer,Shut up.
Homer,"Jump, Free Willy, jump! Jump with all your might!"
Homer,I don't like this new director's cut.
Homer,"Got it, Barn?"
Homer,I'm not stealing it. Hotels expect you to take a few things. It's a souvenir.
Homer,Souvenir.
Homer,"Well, Marge, it was horrible. Everyone was against me in that jury room. But I stood by the courage of my convictions and I prevailed. And that's why we had Chinese food for lunch."
Homer,"Great, Marge. I wanna hear all about it."
Homer,"Maggie, can you point to the monkey?"
Homer,Pfft. What do babies know?
Homer,What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? Oh.
Homer,Ooh.
Homer,"Or, if not then, Christmas."
Homer,"Hee, hee, hee, hee. That is funny."
Homer,"Marge, please. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use."
Homer,Oh.
Homer,Not at all.
Homer,"Well, I'm opposed to the whole thing! Damn opposed!"
Homer,"If he marries your mother, Marge, we'll be brother and sister! And then our kids, they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!"
Homer,"Dad, that will never work. If you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool."
Homer,"NOW, WHAT YOU GOTTA DO / IF YOU WANT TO GET A KISS / IS ACT REAL SMOOTH / AND MAKE YOUR MOVE LIKE THIS."
Homer,NOW WHAT'S THAT RULE?
Homer,All right!
Homer,"Dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him."
Homer,Yabba-dabba-doo!
Homer,"That's right, money. Your money's happiness is all that moneys."
Homer,What?!
Homer,"Woo hoo! Three hundred fifty dollars!! Now I can buy seventy transcripts of ""Nightline""!"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Ew yuuuuck!
Homer,"Hey, Barney, why don't you fill out the groom's side."
Homer,"Whew. Don't try to eat these so-called ""chips."""
Homer,Huh? Oh. Okay. I'll take three.
Homer,"I mean, woo hoo!"
Homer,I was bluffing.
Homer,How dare you call me that?!
Homer,"So, anyhoo, last night, we're playing poker, right. As usual, I'm winning and not realizing it. And Lenny says that I'm uh... get this... ""A little slow."""
Homer,How come you're not laughing? Do you think I'm slow?
Homer,"You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge. They won't let me. One quality show after another. Each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. But they won't, they won't let me live!"
Homer,"Oh, who am I kidding? I am slow..."
Homer,Take another bath in malt liquor?
Homer,"Oh, and how is ""education"" supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine making course and I forgot how to drive?"
Homer,And how.
Homer,"Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class. Look at the way they admire and adore him."
Homer,"That's it! If he can teach a class, he can teach a class. I mean, I can teach a class."
Homer,"Well... I can tell the difference between butter and ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."""
Homer,I've failed again. Everybody can teach a class but me. I'm an idiot. What am I gonna tell my wife and kids?
Homer,That depends. Is there another way to get this job?
Homer,"I'll do it! Anything to get me out of that house, away from all that nagging and noise... Of a family of love. Sha la la la."
Homer,"Look, everyone! Now that I'm a teacher, I've sewed patches on my elbows."
Homer,"Incorrect, Marge. Two perfectly good jackets."
Homer,"Yes, Lisa. Daddy's a teacher."
Homer,"Can't talk now, Flanders. I've got a class to teach."
Homer,"Nothing for me, today! I've got a class to teach!"
Homer,It's all right! I'm a teacher.
Homer,"All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class."
Homer,"Down the hall, room twelve."
Homer,"Ew. Okay, let's get started."
Homer,No talking.
Homer,"Yeah, yeah. That'll eat up some time. Uh, how 'bout you, Otto."
Homer,"Huh? Yeah, I was listening. Very funny."
Homer,"Uh, yes, yes. To the untrained eye I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I am making a point about marriage. For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange."
Homer,"First you have the skin, then the sweet, sweet innards."
Homer,Okay. But then we've got to get to work.
Homer,I told Marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.
Homer,"No, that's not what I meant. Marge and I always talk things over in bed. Like the other night we were fighting about money."
Homer,I was telling Marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.
Homer,Oh yeah. She's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.
Homer,I went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word. I really think I was born to teach.
Homer,"Come on, Marge. Let me in! There's crickets out here."
Homer,"Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff."
Homer,"Oh, you mean about you. All right, maybe I said some things -- some personal things. But, you should have seen 'em, Marge. They really wanted to hear what I had to say."
Homer,"Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order. You're out of order. The whole freakin' system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth. 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge - it's Chinatown."
Homer,Yes ma'am.
Homer,"Now what is a wedding? Well, Webster's Dictionary describes a wedding as: 'The process of removing weeds from one's garden.'"
Homer,"This is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things."
Homer,"No, wait! Uh, uh, wait!... I, yes! I do have a story about two other young marrieds."
Homer,"Now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow."
Homer,"Well let's just call 'em uh, ""Mr. X"" and ""Mrs. Y."" So anyway, Mr. X would say, 'Marge, If this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't Homer J. Simpson.'"
Homer,"Not tonight, Marge. Tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home."
Homer,"Marge, you'll never guess what. My whole class is here. They're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives."
Homer,"So, little Lisa, apple of my eye. How are things down at the ol' schoolhouse?"
Homer,And how's my little major leaguer? Catch any Junebugs today?
Homer,"Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do."
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed..."
Homer,"All right, we're breaking early tonight, class. For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,But I'm not in the cla...
Homer,"Okay, Marge, things were said, mistakes were made. Let's end this madness and get on with our lives."
Homer,"But, I learned my lesson. It'll never happen again."
Homer,"Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing."
Homer,"Honey, the door blew shut! Oh. Fine. That's what you want? You got it. This scene is gettin' old, man. I'm hittin' the road. Maybe I'll drop you a line someday from wherever I wind up in this crazy old world."
Homer,"Don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies."
Homer,"Keep up the rough-housing, son. Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. Oh, these stubborn grass stains."
Homer,"Oh, good, Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back. He has to push the sanctity of marriage or his God will punish him."
Homer,"Good night, Marge."
Homer,Why didn't I take a picture? I had ten years to take a picture.
Homer,"I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm gonna be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together..."
Homer,Together?
Homer,"Good news, Lisa. I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way."
Homer,"Lisa, you will respect your new mother. Now give her a kiss. Kisss herrr."
Homer,"OhmyGodohmyGodohmyGod. All right, let's get our stories straight. She tripped, right?"
Homer,"Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. Oh, I miss Marge. Lisa you're smart. Help me trick her into taking me back."
Homer,I'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.
Homer,"Okay, thirty."
Homer,"All right, brain. It's all up to you. If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever."
Homer,"Moe, what are you doing here?"
Homer,"Bye, Moe!"
Homer,"Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can."
Homer,A bouquet of po...
Homer,I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.
Homer,My tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
Homer,"Wait a minute! Wait, that's it! I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence."
Homer,"Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you. I need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you."
Homer,"Marge, look at me! We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours, I'll be dead. I can't afford to lose your trust again."
Homer,Wait until my class hears about this. Kidding!
Homer,It's great to be indoors with my family.
Homer,"Hey, this is dated two weeks ago."
Homer,Special present?! I don't wanna wait! I want it now! I want the children to see. Oh. Right. Later.
Homer,"Hey, Moe!"
Homer,"It's cool in here, boy. For the rest of the summer, we can live inside the refrigerator."
Homer,I got the idea when I noticed the refrigerator was cold.
Homer,"Marge, can you set the oven to cold?"
Homer,"Yes, Lisa?"
Homer,I understand. Let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk.
Homer,"Ooh, The Tinkler. I like the sound of that. We'll take it."
Homer,"All right, everybody in the pool!"
Homer,Is it a pool yet?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Don't worry boy, when you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer."
Homer,"Ah...There's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet, peaceful dip in your very own pool."
Homer,YAAARR--Ewwwwwww!!
Homer,"Lisa! The Blob has got me! Don't touch me, or he'll get you too!"
Homer,"Chlorine, eh?"
Homer,Mmmm....
Homer,"But why? She's such a fox. I mean, what's on Fox tonight? Something ribald, no doubt."
Homer,"You see, Marge? You see?"
Homer,Not everything. There's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.
Homer,"Oh, I see. Then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. Really, I mean that. Sorry if it sounded sarcastic."
Homer,"Lisa, stop the racket. I'm trying to fix your mother's camera. Now easy... easy."
Homer,"Hm, I'm gonna need a bigger drill."
Homer,"You're steerin' fine, boy... Hard to the right!"
Homer,Hard to the left!
Homer,Cat!... Deer!... Old Man!
Homer,Jackknifed sugar truck. Sugar?
Homer,"Don't worry, buddy. Here's a quarter. Call for help at the nearest phone... I'll keep an eye on things here."
Homer,"We hit the jackpot, here! White gold! Texas tea... sweetener."
Homer,"Read your town charter, boy. ""If food stuffs should touch the ground, said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot."" Since I don't see him around, start shoveling."
Homer,"That's because I've loaded it with sugar!!... Marge, our ship has come in! I found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that I'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. And all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound."
Homer,"Those are prizes. Ooo, a blasting cap!"
Homer,Sugar Man!!
Homer,And you didn't think I'd make any money. I found a dollar while I was waiting for the bus.
Homer,Woo hoo! A four day weekend!
Homer,Must... protect... sugar... Thieves everywhere... The strong must protect the sweet... the sweet
Homer,"In America, first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women."
Homer,"Huh, wha?"
Homer,"Oh am I, Am I really?"
Homer,A-ha!
Homer,"All right, pal. Where'd you get the sugar for that tea?"
Homer,"Never! Never, Marge! I can't live the buttoned-down life like you. I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. Sure I might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. Oh, I'll never be the darling of the so called ""City Fathers"" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this Homer Simpson."
Homer,No!
Homer,Hey! Get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad!
Homer,"Ow! Ow! Oh, they're defending themselves somehow!"
Homer,"Bees are on the what, now?"
Homer,Deal!
Homer,Nooooooo! My sugar is melting! Melting! Oh what a world!
Homer,Oh sugar!
Homer,"It's okay, Marge. I've learned my lesson. A mountain of sugar is too much for one man. It's clear now why God portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in Hawaii."
Homer,Like what?
Homer,Huh? Wuzz wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire?
Homer,"Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!"
Homer,"There you are. Thought you could get away, huh?"
Homer,Hmmm.
Homer,Hm...
Homer,"Mmmm, Chocolate... / Mmmm, invisible cola. / Mmmm, Forbidden donut. / Mmmm sacrilicious. Mmmm, / Mmmm, free goo. Mmmm, something."
Homer,"Oh, okay."
Homer,"Marge, I want you to stop seeing this Jacque. You can let him down gently. But over the next couple of months, I want you to break it off."
Homer,"Ooh, that was a close one, kids."
Homer,"Okay, Marge. As long as we're traumatizing the kids, I have a scandalous story of my own."
Homer,Hi.
Homer,Gotta go.
Homer,I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
Homer,I mean hello!
Homer,"That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator."
Homer,That's unsexy.
Homer,Ew.
Homer,"Well, this is my floor."
Homer,See you tomorrow....
Homer,"I tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nuclear convention in Capital City together..."
Homer,"Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it."
Homer,"Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation."
Homer,Oh!
Homer,Go to hell!
Homer,I was doing my best to resist her...
Homer,"But at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom."
Homer,"Yeah, yeah."
Homer,Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.
Homer,Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
Homer,But they're so sweet.
Homer,"Oh, baby."
Homer,She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
Homer,"Wait a minute, Marge. Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe I'm no expert on the subject. But there was one time I got it right..."
Homer,Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
Homer,"All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!"
Homer,Marge?
Homer,Sure.
Homer,Who? Oh.
Homer,"Marge, pour vous."
Homer,"I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go."
Homer,But not the last.
Homer,"Oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. Look at this Bible I just got. Fifteen bucks! And talk about a preachy book! Everybody's a sinner except for this guy."
Homer,No no no no no no no no no. Ask your mother.
Homer,TV Town! Hammock Land!
Homer,Embarrassed? What are you talking about?
Homer,Oh yes.
Homer,"Hey, look Marge! They're still not fightin' back! I can be a jerk and no one can stop me! Hee hee hee hee!"
Homer,Suckers.
Homer,Shark-boy!
Homer,"Lobster hat... Fishnet Speedo, Jr... Wheelie Shoes... invisible dog leash. Well, I'm packed."
Homer,"Okay, let's make a pact. This is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families."
Homer,"Ah, the Interstate. Fasten your seatbelts, kids. We're on our way to Itchy and Scratchy Land!"
Homer,"Don't worry, I've got an ace up my sleeve."
Homer,No.
Homer,Omigod! What'll I do? What'll I do?
Homer,"The whole trunk's full of 'em, Marge."
Homer,"Now, to absorb some local color through the magic of AM radio."
Homer,No.
Homer,Don't mind if I do.
Homer,"We don't need to do that, Marge. I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all."
Homer,"North. ""South."" Nuts to this! I'm going to take a shortcut."
Homer,"Trust me, Marge. With today's modern cars you can't get lost. What with all the silicon chips and such."
Homer,"All right, we're here. Let us never speak of the shortcut again."
Homer,"Now remember, we're in the Itchy Lot."
Homer,One adult and four children.
Homer,What's that?
Homer,"Well, okay. If it's fun. Let's see..."
Homer,I'll take eleven hundred dollars worth.
Homer,Eyeball stew.
Homer,Oh look! It's the twelve noon robot parade! Hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.
Homer,Parents Island?
Homer,It is the '70s! Right down to the smallest detail!
Homer,Thank you!
Homer,I kicked one of those stupid Itchy characters in the butt.
Homer,"But Marge, I was a political prisoner."
Homer,I kicked a giant mouse in the butt. Do I have to draw you a diagram?
Homer,"Hey look, this one's coming on to me."
Homer,"Yoo hoo, Mr. Robot..."
Homer,"Lisa, don't contradict your elders."
Homer,My hair! You chopped off my hair! Oh God I'm ugly!
Homer,Back you robots! Nobody ruins my family vacation but me. And maybe the boy.
Homer,"What're you, the narrator?"
Homer,"Die, bad robots, die! With a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero."
Homer,But there are five of us.
Homer,That's better.
Homer,"Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. Now, I'm not very political -- I usually think people who vote are a bit ""fruit-y"" -- but, for some reason, this Birch Barlow really speaks to me..."
Homer,"When I'm driving the car, I get to choose the radio station. When you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station."
Homer,I can't take this anymore. Let's switch back.
Homer,"Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob. Yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box."
Homer,Phew.
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,"Oh, Sideshow Bob."
Homer,"It's the Rapture! Quick, get Bart out of the house before God comes!"
Homer,"Hmm. I don't agree with his Bart-killing policy, but I do approve of his Selma-killing policy."
Homer,"I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigajer. And no one in my family's gonna stand for it!"
Homer,We're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls.
Homer,Stuck-up Riverdale punks. Think they're too good for me.
Homer,"Hey, Mr. Smithers!"
Homer,"Well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there."
Homer,"Well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there, again."
Homer,John Denver.
Homer,"Hm, cable's out... Think I'll have a beer."
Homer,"Hm, not a drop in the house. What do you know?"
Homer,I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!
Homer,"Sorry, sorry. Don't worry, there's plenty I can do to keep myself occupied. Maybe I'll check out that axe collection. See ya later."
Homer,Moe! Give me a beer!
Homer,Why should I kill my family?
Homer,You don't look so happy.
Homer,"So, what do you think, Marge? All I need is a title. I was thinking along the lines of ""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something something."
Homer,"Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat!"
Homer,Heh-heh. Scaredy-cat...
Homer,Can't murder now. Eating.
Homer,Noooo!
Homer,Heeeeere's Johnny.
Homer,Daaaa-vid Lettermaaaan!
Homer,"I'm Mike Wallace. I'm Morley Safer. And I'm Ed Bradley. All this and Andy Rooney tonight on ""60 minutes."""
Homer,Must kill family. .
Homer,"Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover."
Homer,"Urge to kill fading, fading..."
Homer,Fading... Rising!
Homer,"...Fading, fading, gone."
Homer,"Come, family, sit in the snow with Daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow."
Homer,Can't. Frozen.
Homer,Urge to kill rising.
Homer,"Y'know, Marge, I've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that I'm really a lucky guy."
Homer,Get it off! Get it off! Get it offf!!
Homer,"This shouldn't be too hard to fix, with the right tools."
Homer,There! Better than new! Now to take her for a test toast.
Homer,What the-?
Homer,Look at that! I'm the first non- Brazilian person to travel backwards through time!
Homer,I've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos. OK. Don't panic. Remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day...
Homer,"Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, I won't destroy the future."
Homer,Stupid bug. You go squish now.
Homer,"But that was just one little insignificant mosquito. That can't change the future, right? Right?"
Homer,Phew. I'm back.
Homer,"Oh, my loving family. Nothing's changed."
Homer,"Hey, what the hell is that geek Flanders doing on TV?"
Homer,What the hell are you smiling at?
Homer,Nooooo!
Homer,"Oh no! They're gaining on me. Wait, I have an idea."
Homer,These wieners will give me the quick energy I need to escape.
Homer,I gotta go back... Fix future...
Homer,This time I'm not gonna touch a thing.
Homer,Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it!
Homer,"Oh, I wish I wish I hadn't killed that fish."
Homer,"Hey, where is everybody?"
Homer,This is gonna cost me.
Homer,"I mean, Heeeyy."
Homer,"Hmm. Fabulous house. Well-behaved kids. Sisters-in-law dead. Luxury sedan. Woo hoo! I hit the jackpot. Marge, dear. Would you kindly pass me a donut?"
Homer,Don't touch anything?!! I'll... touch... whatever... I... feel like!!
Homer,"What's my name?! What color is the sky?! What of donuts? WHAT?! For the love of God, tell meeeee!!!"
Homer,Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's just eat.
Homer,Eh. Close enough.
Homer,"Uh oh, it's seeping in! Stupid cheap weather stripping."
Homer,"I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date. SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET / CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS!"
Homer,"No, it's not that. Didn't you hear? They have no bananas. They have no bananas today."
Homer,New glasses?
Homer,Probably misses his old glasses.
Homer,"Yeah, and then we'd get the chair."
Homer,"It was, Marge. Admit it."
Homer,"Oh good, here comes the collection plate."
Homer,"We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed."
Homer,Stop him! He's headed for the window!
Homer,"Son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money, that's all I need."
Homer,Why you little... How can you look me in the eye and lie like that?!
Homer,"Tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?"
Homer,"Ooo, how convenient."
Homer,"See, son? Telling the truth isn't so bad."
Homer,To the little girl's room!
Homer,I like those odds.
Homer,"Whew, that's all of 'em. And I'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. How 'bout a present, son?"
Homer,Done and done.
Homer,"Ah, the mysteries of life."
Homer,"Sports, sports, sports, sports. Sports, sports, sports, sports. Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports."
Homer,I mean my little girl buddy.
Homer,I tried.
Homer,"Okay, son, just remember to have fun out there today, and if you lose, I'll kill you."
Homer,"Well boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. Here's your turtle, alive and well."
Homer,"Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such."
Homer,"Oh! Ooh my - oh, the hell with it."
Homer,"Okay, hotshots, now that my daughter is on your team, I want to make a few things clear."
Homer,"I don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. No jokes, no taunting... Look! That kid's got bosoms! Who's got a wet towel?"
Homer,"Come here, you butterball."
Homer,"We're laughing with her, Marge! There's a big difference."
Homer,With her.
Homer,"Okay, little buddy, hop in!"
Homer,"Okay, hon."
Homer,"Sucker. Competitive, violent, that's why you're here."
Homer,"Ah, sorry Bart, Lisa and I are going out for gelato. We'd ask you to come but, you know..."
Homer,"Wow, eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster. To think of all the time I wasted on you... uh, well, not wasted... I love you."
Homer,"Quiet down, Bart!"
Homer,"Okay. All right, pie, I'm just gonna do this."
Homer,"And if you get eaten, it's your own fault."
Homer,Hey! Apu just called. This Friday Lisa's team is playing Bart's team. You're in direct competition. And don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. I want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.
Homer,"Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight."
Homer,Pass the ketchup.
Homer,I asked for ketchup. I'm eating salad here.
Homer,"Moe, what are you doin' here?"
Homer,"Now that we're all alone, Marge, admit it. You like Lisa best."
Homer,"Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you?"
Homer,"Well, you can't possibly like Maggie best. What has she ever done? Nothin' for nobody!"
Homer,Hi kids!
Homer,I love Bart!
Homer,"No, wait! I love Lisa!"
Homer,"Beer. Oh, Marge, I love you!"
Homer,"Oh my God, Marge. A penalty shot, with only four seconds left. It's your child versus mine! The winner will be showered with praise, the loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore."
Homer,They're both losers. Losers!
Homer,"You like sweets, kids? I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. You'd spit them out! You would! I'm talking about the Candy Industry Trade Show. ."
Homer,They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump bar and Krusty Klump bar with almonds.
Homer,"Sorry kids, but this is one event I want my darling wife by my side."
Homer,"Ma-arge. They can't carry enough candy. They have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you."
Homer,They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
Homer,"Hurry, Marge. If we get there early we can get our pictures taken with the two surviving Musketeers."
Homer,I feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
Homer,"Brilliant... exquisite ...ooh, you'll do well... Gimme those, etc."
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,Mmm hmm. Keep going.
Homer,Oooh -- gummy bears. Gummy calves heads. Gummy jaw breakers.
Homer,What dat?
Homer,Must have rare gummy. Distract the salesman Marge!
Homer,"Now, this is going to take all my skill."
Homer,"Run, Marge! Save the booty!"
Homer,"See you in hell, candy boys."
Homer,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where's my gummy de Milo? Okay, don't panic. She can't have gotten far; she has no arms."
Homer,"Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in there."
Homer,"See, she's having the time of her life."
Homer,"So, a graduate student, huh? How come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?"
Homer,"Nobody's blaming you. Hey, could you take the wheel for a second? I have to scratch myself in two places at once."
Homer,Precious Venus...
Homer,"Hey, kids. Lots of candy left for breakfast."
Homer,Oh no! The candy conventioneers tracked us down!
Homer,For a minute there I thought I was in big trouble. It's just a...
Homer,"Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am. I can't even say the word ""titmouse"" without giggling like a schoolgirl."
Homer,Oh that. No. I was just grabbing a gummy Venus de Milo that got stuck to your pants.
Homer,"C'mon, I'm a decent guy..."
Homer,"Well Lisa, remember that post card Grampa sent us from Florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?"
Homer,"That's right, we all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman."
Homer,"Well, that's kind of a gray area."
Homer,"Thanks, kids."
Homer,"Do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!"
Homer,"It's okay, they're with me."
Homer,"They're ruining my whole life. Marge, please, this is where I need you the most. I'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better. Okay-- go."
Homer,Uh-huh?
Homer,"You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. Oh no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, God help me! Help me, God!"
Homer,Y'ello?
Homer,"Hmm, I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and evenhanded. I'll do it."
Homer,"...Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed, she was sitting on the gummy Venus so I grabbed it off of her. Oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy. I just wish I had another one right now. But the most important thing is..."
Homer,"Okay. Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch? I like his style."
Homer,Hee hee. Here comes the bouncing ball of justice!
Homer,"Awww, crap!"
Homer,"... Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed she was sitting on -- her -- ""sweet can""! -- so I grabbed -- her ""sweet can""! Oh, just thinking about -- her ""can""! I just wish I had her -- ""sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet can""!"
Homer,"Marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine. Now go upstairs and pack your bags. We're gonna start a new life under the sea."
Homer,UNDER THE SEA / UNDER THE SEA / THERE'LL BE NO ACCUSATIONS / JUST FRIENDLY CRUSTACEANS / UNDER THE SEA.
Homer,Not with that attitude.
Homer,"It didn't blow over, Marge. Nothin' ever blows over for me."
Homer,"Hey, that's a half truth."
Homer,Whaa?
Homer,"Ooh, ""Portrait!"" Sounds classy... doesn't it?"
Homer,I don't have a friend in the world.
Homer,"Oh, Marge. It's a miracle."
Homer,I need a hug.
Homer,How come you guys hesitated?
Homer,Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.
Homer,Are you hugging the TV?
Homer,"I like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. I know - ""Evening at the Improv."" They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s."
Homer,"Oh, I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now."
Homer,But those shows all look so crummy.
Homer,"Hello. I am Homer Simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, ""Father Goose."" You know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. Nobody cares that I didn't do it. But I didn't. Okay, look, I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. Like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. So I figured, ""We'll see about that."" So I get this big chunk of cinderblock and I..."
Homer,"Oh, gotta go. Innocent!"
Homer,"Marge, this is so depressing. My only hope is this homemade Prozac. Hmm... needs more ice-cream."
Homer,Precious Venus...
Homer,Thank you!
Homer,You're both right.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,And Ted Koppel is a robot.
Homer,"Oh, that man is sick!"
Homer,But listen to the music. He's evil!
Homer,"Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing."
Homer,Let's never fight again.
Homer,"Please, Marge. How often can I see a movie of this caliber on late-night TV?"
Homer,"No. It's just that I've only seen this movie twice before, and I've seen you every night for the last eleven ye-- What I meant to say is... we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. I promise."
Homer,Enchiladas.
Homer,"Marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but I promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex."
Homer,Ooooookay.
Homer,Oh. All right.
Homer,"Hey, Marge! This guy looks like Apu!"
Homer,Yes. And I am pursuing my interest in...
Homer,"Oooh. ""Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American."""
Homer,N -- -- yes. But please don't you say that word.
Homer,Faucet's jammed into my back... I'm stuck.
Homer,"Ooh, the Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus."
Homer,"Oh, here we are. The ""Utility Room."""
Homer,"No, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room."
Homer,Never mind. You wouldn't understand.
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,You're home safe. Done my duty. See ya the next time we need your signature.
Homer,Kids-here's-fifty-dollars-Why-not-go-to-the-movies-then-take-a-cab-to-your-Aunts'-house-Stay-there-Phone-call-you-later-Now-Now-Now.
Homer,"Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards."
Homer,You want me to spend more time with dad? What about my New Year's resolution?
Homer,Yeah... Where are my pants?
Homer,"Hoo mama! This is finally really happening. After years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme! And quick!"
Homer,"Sir! Hello, Sir! Yes, you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife!"
Homer,"Ow. I guess people have some sort of ""moral objection"" to our sex-drug."
Homer,Great. I'm gonna be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.
Homer,That is correct.
Homer,They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
Homer,"Ewww, why're we stopping at this dump?"
Homer,Wow. Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted.
Homer,Ow!
Homer,"Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? Maybe I could've been something more than I am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm."
Homer,"Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me."
Homer,You're the screw-up!
Homer,All right! That's it. We're goin' home. I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!
Homer,Get out.
Homer,Out.
Homer,"Of course not Marge, just for the rest of his life. He said I was an accident. He didn't want to have me!"
Homer,"I know, but you're never supposed to tell the child."
Homer,"But when I do it, it's cute."
Homer,"Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty... chewy... chocolatey... Put it away, boy... situation. And your daddy has realized something very important: a father should always make his kids feel wanted. Starting right now, I promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve."
Homer,Dad!
Homer,"Son! My dear Son. From now on I'm going to be a good and attentive father. And for starters your ""old man"" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!"
Homer,"You're no girl, you're a boy. A good boy. You can be president. Scratch that. You will be president."
Homer,I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
Homer,Wheeee! Wheeee!!!
Homer,B-But I'm using my whole ass.
Homer,"Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking."
Homer,Here's where it all started to go wrong. How'm I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself?
Homer,Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father... Wait a minute.
Homer,Dad? This photo is a blessing. It eases my pain.
Homer,I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house.
Homer,You know what?
Homer,We're both screw-ups.
Homer,So are you gonna say something nice now?
Homer,"Aw, Dad."
Homer,"I'm with you, Dad."
Homer,This is gonna to be great.
Homer,"Ah, come on, everybody. This bar is like a tavern to me."
Homer,It's Raining Men?
Homer,Jokes on them. I'm still alive.
Homer,Can't.
Homer,I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
Homer,"Yes. Cris-a-tunity. You're right! I've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. That's it. I'm going to find a new bar to drink in. And I'm gonna get drunker than I've been in my entire life! Bart, where's my wallet?"
Homer,Thank you!
Homer,"Wow, classy."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Hmmm. This looks like a nice, friendly place."
Homer,"Wait a minute. There's something bothering me about this place. I know - this lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit. Enjoy your death trap, ladies."
Homer,"Gr-aargh! Oh my God, this man is my exact double. That dog has a puffy tail!"
Homer,"Here, Puff! Here Puff!"
Homer,"The last bar in Springfield. If they don't let me in here, I'm gonna have to quit drinking."
Homer,"Shut up, liver."
Homer,"Ooh, my liver hurts."
Homer,"I'd like a beer, please."
Homer,"Uh, but I am a pilot."
Homer,I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
Homer,But I -
Homer,"Yeah, that's exactly why I'm here."
Homer,"But, I keep tellin' ya, I'm not a pilot."
Homer,"Uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan."
Homer,"And um, ah, I'll just uh get us started..."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Good news, everybody. Because I endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want."
Homer,"But Marge, you deserve a vacation. It's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state."
Homer,"Come on Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you please?"
Homer,"So Marge, pretty sweet, eh?"
Homer,"Marge, what's wrong? Are you Hungry? Sleepy? Gassy? Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it?"
Homer,"Take it easy, Marge. How 'bout if we dope you up real good?"
Homer,"It's okay, Marge. We don't need to go on a trip. We'll just wait for the killer bees to come to us."
Homer,I'm sure it's nothing.
Homer,Permit me to solve the mystery. Your mother has a fear of flying.
Homer,Not everybody.
Homer,Where? Where?
Homer,"Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. Push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again."
Homer,"You heard your mother's ramblings. She's fine, so behave."
Homer,"Marge, it's three A.M. Shouldn't you be baking?"
Homer,And I don't believe in it. It breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.
Homer,It's Raining Men!
Homer,"Now Marge, ""Dear Abby"" says seeing films about air travel can calm your fears. Ooh, here are some upbeat titles. ""Hero."" ""Fearless."" ""Alive."""
Homer,She's fine.
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. Well what about me, Marge?"
Homer,"All right, Lisa, you got your way. Your mom's going to a psychiatrist. She's gonna tell Marge to leave me. It'll break up the family, and you'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans."
Homer,"Well keep it up, then."
Homer,"Good, you do that."
Homer,You'll be picking many a bean.
Homer,"Bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down."
Homer,All right. How much do you charge?
Homer,Keep sliding.
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. First, what are your qualifications?"
Homer,"Oh, no, I'm not here to take a reading test. I wanna see some credentials."
Homer,"You see?! You see?! ""I"" just left ""my"" first session and ""I"" haven't opened ""my"" mouth yet."
Homer,Did you talk about me in therapy today?
Homer,"Tell me the truth! Don't tell her I raised my voice. Don't. Happy family, happy family."
Homer,"Oh, being stuck on this God forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite I have."
Homer,"Why, you clattering clank of.... My dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. D'oh the pain! D'oh the pain of it all!"
Homer,That's okay. You don't have to make her into some kind of superwoman. She can get on a plane. That's plenty.
Homer,"Don't worry about a thing, honey. I'm gonna help you through this."
Homer,Those are all normal noises. Luggage compartment closing. Cross-checking. Just sit back and relax.
Homer,That's just the engine powering up. That's just the engine struggling.
Homer,That's just a carp swimming around your ankles.
Homer,What should we do until you get back?
Homer,"Aw, it didn't work."
Homer,Lousy traffic jams. The traffic report'll get me outta this one.
Homer,"Hey, how come you guys got such great parking places?"
Homer,"All right, Econo-Save, you just made the list."
Homer,"Hey, will you guys help me fix my..."
Homer,"Hey, how come you guys got better chairs than me?"
Homer,"Hey, you guys wanna go bowling tonight?"
Homer,Like what?
Homer,Shut up.
Homer,I saved your life. That egg sandwich could have killed you by cholesterol.
Homer,"So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays. And they don't tell me where they go. It's like a conspiracy."
Homer,"I do... now. Anyway, I'm gonna follow them tonight and see where they go."
Homer,"Well, something did."
Homer,"Oh, okay. Have it your own way, Marge. I'll be back in a minute. I'm going outside. To stalk... ... Lenny and Carl."
Homer,All I have to do is follow the yellow drip road.
Homer,"Hee hee hee! I can see everything. And they're none the wiser, hee hee hee."
Homer,I saw weird stuff in that place last night. Weird strange sick twisted eerie godless evil stuff. And I want in.
Homer,"Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?"
Homer,Next.
Homer,"So, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?"
Homer,"You'd better run, egg!"
Homer,"Why don't people like me, Marge?"
Homer,Then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?
Homer,It is. It's been happening to me all my life.
Homer,I felt so left out.
Homer,I'd give anything to get into the Stonecutters.
Homer,What do they do? What don't they do! Oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! My stars.
Homer,"Not as such, no."
Homer,"Do I ever! It's five years later and I still think I'm a chicken. I'm a chicken, Marge."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,What?
Homer,This is it. My ticket in. They have to let me join if I'm the son of a member.
Homer,I'll take this Communist one too.
Homer,"Comin' through! Can't throw me out! My father's a member! I'm in, I'm in!"
Homer,"Aw, thanks, Lenny. When am I gonna be initiated?"
Homer,"Number one? Ha ha. What kind of stupid wiener name is that? ""Hello, my name is Number One."" And so forth."
Homer,You outrank Mr. Burns here?
Homer,Is he the leader?
Homer,"Okay, okay, I didn't ask for your life story."
Homer,I think I have to do it again. My blindfold came off.
Homer,"Hey, have you ever noticed that the ""Crossing the Desert"" is a lot like ""The Unblinking Eye"" and it's exactly like ""The Wreck of the Hesperus""?"
Homer,And by the Sacred Parchment I swear that if I reveal the secrets of the Stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.
Homer,Oh really?
Homer,Really?
Homer,But what if I were to shake your hand in this wise?
Homer,"Heh heh heh! So long, suckers!"
Homer,"Yep, but they gave me these Rollerblades so I can glide to the front door."
Homer,Heh heh heh heh. Sweet.
Homer,Jealous?
Homer,You're jealous.
Homer,What's this?
Homer,Everything lasts forever.
Homer,That's because you trust your stupid school books. Here's what really happened at the signing of the Declaration of Independence...
Homer,You wanna see how Davy Crockett really died at the Alamo? You must be 18.
Homer,"Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoists, AA meetings, beer night. It's wonderful, Marge. I've never felt so accepted in all my life. These people looked deep within my soul, and assigned me a number based on the order in which I joined."
Homer,WHO RIGS EVERY OSCAR NIGHT? /
Homer,"Uh-oh. I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt, I could lose the respect of my beloved brethren."
Homer,The Black Panthers?
Homer,"Huh? Oh. Yeah. Thanks, Lenny."
Homer,What? Did I miss something?
Homer,Please don't kick me out! This society is everything to me! Please give me another chance! I've learned my lesson.
Homer,I've learned my lesson!
Homer,Oh. Sorry.
Homer,Oh that. It's just a birth mark and I'll thank you not to stare.
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,Wow. Mental note. Don't overdo this.
Homer,Peek-a-boo!
Homer,I always wondered if there was a god. And now I know. There is. And it's me.
Homer,So?
Homer,No.
Homer,Remove the girl.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,I'm out.
Homer,"Oh I win again, don't I? Woo hoo."
Homer,"You know, I think you guys are lettin' me win."
Homer,"From now on, I want you to be honest with me. I mean, I'm not perfect, right?"
Homer,"Lisa, you were right. My happiness is fading."
Homer,"What do you mean, isolated? ...ated...ated..ated..ated."
Homer,"Hm... I could help others. I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the Civil War ."
Homer,Couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
Homer,"Brothers, brothers."
Homer,"Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson. Helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. So instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate."
Homer,"You were right, Lisa. I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled. And with my brothers, the Stonecutters, behind me, this is the beginning of a better world for all of us."
Homer,"Hey, fellas. Can I join?"
Homer,"Loyal stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg."
Homer,"Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club."
Homer,"You know, Marge you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to."
Homer,This club'd better be worth it.
Homer,"Go Knightboat, go!"
Homer,Quiet. I will not hear another word against the Boat.
Homer,"But Marge, Knightboat. The crime solving boat."
Homer,It was Bart.
Homer,"So many memories. Aw, look... Knightboat."
Homer,Thanks honey. Bank shot.
Homer,And here's our TV next to the mirror. It looks like we have two.
Homer,Moom.
Homer,That's exciting.
Homer,"Well, I'm glad you asked. It's actually a very interesting story."
Homer,"It all began about two years ago, before Maggie was even born. Bart, you were Lisa's age and Lisa you were the age Bart was several years ago."
Homer,Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any TV show. It was a tumultuous time for our nation. The clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.
Homer,"The Information Super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about ""Star Trek,"" and the domestication of the dog continued unabated."
Homer,I was at my work station when suddenly...
Homer,Not on my shift.
Homer,Oh no you don't!
Homer,"Simpson ten, terrorists eight."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Woo hoo! This is it! With this single glorious check, I'm finally completely out of debt."
Homer,"Yes! With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy job."
Homer,Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan. A plan that'll fix you good.
Homer,"Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss ya."
Homer,"Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty. And since I quit, I can do anything I want."
Homer,"Ooh, lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone, oh, I don't know... didn't use a coaster!!"
Homer,Such a nice tidy office. Maybe it's time you started living like a pig!
Homer,"Oh, I hope I haven't upset you... bongo head!"
Homer,That's for employing me for eight years! Ha ha.
Homer,"And that is that. Goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. Hello dream job in paradise."
Homer,And now the final phase of my plan.
Homer,"Hey Barney, any chance you can get me a job here?"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Why?
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. I've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. There will be exactly enough money for you, me, Bart and Lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices."
Homer,"From now on we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy quilted kind..."
Homer,And only one of you kids can go to college.
Homer,That night your mother and I went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. We began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...
Homer,Marge...
Homer,I've got sand in my underpants.
Homer,"I love you, Marge."
Homer,Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. I hope things stay exactly like this forever.
Homer,"It's okay, Marge. They pave the way for this kind of filth in school."
Homer,"Actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. At that time, I had no idea Maggie even existed."
Homer,Hi Maggie.
Homer,"So anyhoo, back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant."
Homer,"Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. I've got to wash my hair."
Homer,The next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.
Homer,Mmm... bowling fresh.
Homer,Mmm... urinal fresh.
Homer,No.
Homer,"...I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down."
Homer,"I was in heaven. If horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well."
Homer,I'M GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL!
Homer,"Can't talk, praying. Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me and I am thankful. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is."
Homer,"Hey, wait a minute. What are all these presents? It looks like you're ""showering"" Marge with gifts."
Homer,"Well, it was my major."
Homer,"So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done."
Homer,Ah... another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.
Homer,Thank you. Thank you very much. It is nice work.
Homer,"It's true, the bundle is little. But I'm not in it for the money."
Homer,"This is getting very abstract, but thank you. I do enjoy working at the bowling alley."
Homer,Man. It's windy as hell out there.
Homer,"Hmmm. With little, tiny, baby-sized gifts. Well... I'll be in the tub."
Homer,New job?... Marge is pregnant?! Nooooo!
Homer,Oh just that one time.
Homer,You're pregnant?!
Homer,You're pregnant again?!
Homer,"Well who wouldn't be upset? That new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from Sunday! Hey, where're you going?"
Homer,You're pregnant! We're gonna have to have a baby! All our financial plans are ruined. We're doomed! Doomed I tells ya!
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Anyhoo...
Homer,We're doomed!
Homer,Check.
Homer,"Yeah, a raise! I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. But I'm damn good at this one. That's it! I'm gonna march right up to Al and say..."
Homer,"Steve -- I mean Al, I think I deserve a raise."
Homer,How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise?
Homer,Of course!
Homer,Bowling! Bowling here! Come bowl now! Get yer bowling! Who's ready?! Bowling!
Homer,"My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. I failed. Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done."
Homer,"This was the happiest time of my life. I'll never forget you guys. Especially you, Joey."
Homer,"Don't worry, Joey. We'll make it to California some day."
Homer,I needed more money to support my growing family. And there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it.
Homer,"Actually, I quit and I came to get my job back."
Homer,Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
Homer,Thanks for giving me my old job back.
Homer,I've never been so miserable in all my life. But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids. I've got to carry the burden all by myself.
Homer,"Hi honey, how are you?"
Homer,I can't go on with this charade any longer. I hate my job. I hate my life. And ever since I found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck.
Homer,"It's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it, Marge."
Homer,"It's wonderful! It's magical! Oh boy, here it comes - another mouth."
Homer,Marvelous.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Hello. Aw. It's a boy... And what a boy.
Homer,"A girl! Oh Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! Not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!"
Homer,"Come on Marge, show a little enthusiasm."
Homer,Absolutely.
Homer,"Oh, there are pictures. I keep them where I need the most cheering up."
Homer,...And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.
Homer,"Yeah, except I forgot to go to work."
Homer,Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed. Didn't you hear what the guy in the building said?
Homer,"Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. Didn't they?"
Homer,There's that word again.
Homer,"Well then, I have a back-up plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
Homer,"I'm getting to that. So anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
Homer,"So anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
Homer,All right!
Homer,It's at times like this I wish I were a religious man.
Homer,Just a second.
Homer,"What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet. Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head."
Homer,"Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow."
Homer,"Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter."
Homer,Homer Simpson takes care of his family.
Homer,Flanders! Open up!
Homer,Get out of there. My family needs to use your bomb shelter.
Homer,No deal. Out.
Homer,An hour! I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?
Homer,THERE it is.
Homer,I can't get the... I can't get the door closed. Somebody's going to have to get out.
Homer,"Uh, yeah. I can do that."
Homer,"Wait a minute. We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. That's you, Flanders."
Homer,"I'm terribly sorry. Flanders is the only useless person here. If anyone dies, it should be him. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. So let's kick Flanders out. Sorry."
Homer,"No, no! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it, stop it! I can't take this anymore. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. Especially his children. I'm goin' out there."
Homer,And it was a baby ox.
Homer,"I know kids, I'm scared too."
Homer,I am holding still. I am squirming.
Homer,It must be the first of the month! New billboard day!
Homer,"""This year give her English Muffins."" Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard."
Homer,Best in the West. It rhymes.
Homer,Clown college? You can't eat that.
Homer,"Well, I got everything I was supposed to get. I'm not going to enroll in that clown college though. That advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever."
Homer,Clowns are funny.
Homer,Marge.
Homer,That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college!
Homer,Hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.
Homer,You weren't complaining when I got you this close to Chachi.
Homer,Homer.
Homer,"Ooh, I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life."
Homer,Stop it! You're killing me! Seattle...
Homer,"Steady, steady..."
Homer,Kill wealthy dowager.
Homer,Got it! No shock for me .
Homer,To- Audience -I - now - proclaim - this - new - burger... for sale.
Homer,Lord save me.
Homer,Omigod! He's stealing all the burgers! Why you little - I've got you!
Homer,"Hey, hey."
Homer,"And - then - take - that, and - put - that - in - there - and Ah. Here's your giraffe, little girl."
Homer,That's the spirit. Never give up.
Homer,"I'm beat, and after work I've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the Ace Awards."
Homer,"Oh yeah. When I started this clown thing I thought it would be nothing but glory. You know, the glory of being a clown? I tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when I see the smiles on their little faces, I just know they're getting ready to jab me with something."
Homer,"And now the winner for the most promising new series on cable: old ""Starsky and Hutches."""
Homer,"Uh, can't. I've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo."
Homer,"Uh... no. I'm going a different way than you, Dick."
Homer,"Look, you're gonna be having dinner with Groucho tonight if you don't beat it."
Homer,"Being a clown sucks. You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. Who am I clowning? I have no business being a clown. I'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business."
Homer,Oh no.
Homer,I'm not Krusty.
Homer,I am not Krusty.
Homer,"Hey, he didn't give me a ticket! This is an intriguing development."
Homer,"You mean I get 5% off on everything in the store just because I look like... I mean, just because I am Krusty the clown?"
Homer,"I'm telling you, Marge, this will work. They'll think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff. I've been gettin' free stuff all day. Look at this swell bucket of house paint."
Homer,Look at it.
Homer,"Well if we agree, then why are we arguing?"
Homer,I want a free car because I'm Krusty. Krusty the clown! Get it? Krus-ty!
Homer,"I want everything that's coming to Krusty the clown, which is me... Krusty."
Homer,"Hey, what are these holes?"
Homer,Oh yeah. Speed holes.
Homer,Putting speed holes in my car. Makes it go faster.
Homer,What keeps doin' that?
Homer,But wait. You can't kill me for being Krusty. I'm not him. I'm Homer Simpson.
Homer,Uh... actually my name is Barney. Yeah. Barney Gumbel.
Homer,"Uh... actually my real name is uh... Think, Krusty, think... Joe Valachi."
Homer,Benedict Arnold!
Homer,Krusty the clown.
Homer,"But, I've never been able to do the..."
Homer,How 'bout if I just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere?
Homer,Okay.
Homer,I'll never be able to do this trick... never.
Homer,Hey! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm the greatest clown in the world!
Homer,Krusty! Oh thanks! Thanks a lot! You came here to save me!
Homer,"Heh-heh, good one, Krusty."
Homer,Ta-Da!
Homer,I'm a singing in the show... Hot! Yeow! Cold! Ow! Hot! Cold! Hot! Ow! Who's! Doing! That?!
Homer,Burkina Faso? Disputed Zone? Who called all these weird places?
Homer,"No, I'm gonna ask Marge."
Homer,"Psh, that's no reason to block the TV."
Homer,"There it is. ""Aust-rali-a."" I'll be damned..."
Homer,"Look at this country: ""U - r - gay."""
Homer,"Oh, he'll agitate ya. Ho, ho. He sure will. What can we do for you?"
Homer,"That's tough but fair. Boy, go with the man."
Homer,"All Bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to Australia?"
Homer,We left at 1:30 P.M. Monday. What time is it now?
Homer,"Hey, are you like one of those English guards who can't laugh or smile or anything?"
Homer,"Oh, yeah, this is the life. Boy, next summer, can you commit some fraud in Orlando, Florida?"
Homer,SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY... OF THEE I SING.
Homer,"Really? Look, boy! Now I'm in Australia! Now I'm in America!"
Homer,Australia! America! Austr--
Homer,"--alia! America, Australia, Ameri-- ow!"
Homer,"Hey, gimme one of those famous giant beers I've heard so much about."
Homer,"No. It's pretty big, I guess."
Homer,Punishment?!
Homer,Booting?
Homer,What kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot?!
Homer,"You sold us out, Conover!"
Homer,Stay back or I'll boot your Prime Minister! I'll do it! So help me God I'll boot him!
Homer,"When will you Australians learn? In America, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. The streets are safe. Old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. And the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. So, like us, let your children run wild and free. Because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. Now boy, run back to the embassy! Back to American soil!"
Homer,"Yeah, there's a lot more mucus!"
Homer,Maaarge!
Homer,"Show 'em what American butts are made of, son!"
Homer,"Hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?"
Homer,"Hey, look. Those frogs are eating all their crops."
Homer,Take a guess.
Homer,"Yeah, that's right Barney. This year I invested in pumpkins. They've been going up the whole month of October, and I got a feeling they're gonna peak right around January. And bang, that's when I'll cash in."
Homer,"All right, let's not panic. I'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. I can get by with one."
Homer,How am I going to tell Marge we're broke? I need a miracle.
Homer,My house is on fire! Woo hoo! Insurance to the rescue.
Homer,"Marge, we had a deal. Your sisters don't come here after six, and I stop eating your lipstick."
Homer,"All right, that's the last straw. It's time to take out the trash. But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
Homer,Wrong!
Homer,"Sweet, trusting Marge. I can't let you down. I'll get some money somehow."
Homer,"Hello Vegas? Give me 100 bucks on red. All right, I'll send you a check."
Homer,If only I could think of an invention. Something that would really make money. Must concentrate and work harder than I've ever worked...
Homer,"Uh, could I just get a look at that?"
Homer,"But uh, could I just..."
Homer,Let me see! Let me see! Out of the way!
Homer,"No, my invention! All my money problems could've..."
Homer,"Oh, Marge, my loyal wife, of course not."
Homer,"And Lisa, my little princess."
Homer,And who could forget dear Rat boy?
Homer,"Gosh, Moe, I use these all the time. Couldn't you just bash my head in?"
Homer,Rye am Romer Rimpson...
Homer,"Uh, I need an another extension on my mortgage payments."
Homer,That was in the third grade.
Homer,"Well, good luck finding it because I'm gonna take the numbers off tonight."
Homer,Then I'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.
Homer,"All right, you'll get your money."
Homer,"You're my last-last chance, bottom of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot, wish you would do it but probably won't, final resort, to lend me money."
Homer,What a wonderful dinner. What a beautiful family. Someone get a picture of me with my arm around this steak.
Homer,"Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today. And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair."
Homer,"Mmmm, slanty."
Homer,Time to fertilize the lawn. A couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.
Homer,It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
Homer,"All right, you had your fun. Now get lost."
Homer,Hunh?
Homer,No! I'm giving them a foot massage. At least let me have that.
Homer,"Well, maybe I'll just stay and work overtime. My sisters-in-law are at my house again."
Homer,Request permission to slink by.
Homer,But you're already smoking cig...
Homer,You're really pushing it.
Homer,I'll have to trust you on that.
Homer,No! Don't tell Marge! I'll be good. I'll be good!
Homer,"But... Yes, ma'am."
Homer,"Rabsolutely rothing, Rarge."
Homer,What paper?
Homer,"I don't know Marge, I can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings."
Homer,You told!
Homer,Sorry Marge.
Homer,I never want to see you again! You either!
Homer,"I was ashamed, Marge. I failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, I was a B-plus dog. I'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight."
Homer,Nobody make me any breakfast. A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.
Homer,"In that case, I'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it. Maybe a little powdered sugar."
Homer,What was that -- national anthem?
Homer,Daddy has very important work to do. He's looking through the Want Ads to find a part-time job.
Homer,"Oh, no wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest sex machine."
Homer,I'll never pay off that debt.
Homer,"That's it! I'll make money with a chauffeur job. Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa."
Homer,"No. Well anyway, turn it off."
Homer,"Oh wow! I can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend, Mel Brooks! I love that movie, ""Young Frankenstein"". ...Scared the Hell out of me."
Homer,"Hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. I'll be that Carl Reiner guy, you be what's his face."
Homer,"Sir, today every country has a national anthem. Did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?"
Homer,"Chauffeur's license, eh? Mel, buckle your borscht belt!"
Homer,"Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV where stupid Patty and stupid Selma work. Sometimes I think God is teasing me, just like he teased Moses in the desert."
Homer,"Oh, okay Marge, I'll get along with them. Then I will hug some snakes! Yes, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. Now that's sarcasm."
Homer,"Look, all I ask is that you be fair."
Homer,"You won't be happy 'til my family thinks I'm a loser, will you?"
Homer,"Nagging the driver, minus ten points for you."
Homer,"Being a jerk, minus a million points."
Homer,"Well, I..."
Homer,I'll never forgive myself for this.
Homer,Yes. I am in flavor country.
Homer,It's a big country.
Homer,"Please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides."
Homer,"I didn't do it for them. I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you. Please ask me to kill for you."
Homer,Call off the debt?
Homer,Call off the debt?
Homer,"Debt's off! Let's go, Marge. Woo hoo!"
Homer,"Marge, are we Jewish?"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Mmmmm.
Homer,But what can I do? I'm just... one man.
Homer,"Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny! Stupid Dockers! Oh, the belt is buckled."
Homer,My ears are burning.
Homer,"No, my ears are really burning. I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-tip."
Homer,"Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?"
Homer,"Oh, you're right."
Homer,There ya... Just second...
Homer,"Oh, that should..."
Homer,It was a gummy bear.
Homer,"Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman, the Critic."
Homer,"But, I'm still hungry."
Homer,"Yeah, well I won the belching contest at work."
Homer,"Yeah, well Scooby Doo can doo-doo... but Jimmy Carter is smarter!"
Homer,"Whatcha doing, Marge?"
Homer,"Marge, do you respect my intelligence?"
Homer,Okay! Wait a minute. Why did it take you so long to say yes?
Homer,Okay! Wait a minute. Are you humoring me?
Homer,"Okay! Wait a minute. That's bad! Look, I know I'm not witty like that critic guy. But does he know all the words to the Oscar Mayer song?"
Homer,"That's it, Marge, he knows the whole hot dog song. Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by."
Homer,"It's just you and me now, lock of hair..."
Homer,"Yeah, well you think I'm stupid."
Homer,Prove it.
Homer,Put me on that film jury festival thing.
Homer,"Exactly. Heh, heh."
Homer,Pull my finger.
Homer,This contest is over. Give that man the ten thousand dollars!
Homer,But ... The ball... His groin!... It works on so many levels! Roll it again.
Homer,What'd I miss?
Homer,Football in the groin. Football in the groin.
Homer,"Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute."
Homer,I have every right to be on that jury even though I got there because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
Homer,"Oh great, now you're going to make fun of me."
Homer,"Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do."
Homer,Hm. Barney's movie has heart. But football in the groin had a football in the groin.
Homer,Wow. I'll never drink another beer.
Homer,I'll take ten.
Homer,"Aw, you know something Marge, it's not that tough being a film cricket."
Homer,"Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's Beer Nuts. Mmm... Beer Nuts."
Homer,Can I have some?
Homer,"Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I mightst sup on suckling pig this noon."
Homer,I've eaten eight different meats. I'm a true Renaissance man.
Homer,"Woo hoo! Oh, Marge, that's great news!"
Homer,"Oh, ah, but Mr. Milhouse, my little girl's getting married!"
Homer,"Oh, I gotta call everyone and tell 'em the good news."
Homer,Maggie! I need to use the phone!
Homer,"Will that girl ever shut up? Okay, Marge. I'll plan everything. We can have the reception at Moe's. Wait, why not have the whole wedding there? We'll do it on a Monday morning -- there'll be fewer drunks."
Homer,"Well, these seem to be in order. I'll be out back in the hammock."
Homer,"Yo, Hugh. Here's a little bit of U.S. hospitality. What do you think of that?"
Homer,"Whew! Uh, enjoy."
Homer,"You can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom I built. Remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box."
Homer,"Oh, right."
Homer,"So, Hugh. Have you heard all the latest American jokes? Uh, here's a good one. Pull my finger."
Homer,"I said, pull my finger."
Homer,Me and Bart'll take Hugh out on the town this afternoon.
Homer,Great. There's only one thing I ask in return.
Homer,"So this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh Hugh?"
Homer,"Hugh, there's something I want you to have. My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge, and they brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage. We don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive."
Homer,"Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again."
Homer,Keep it down in there!
Homer,"Hey, how are you. Nice to meet ya."
Homer,"You know what's great about you English? ""Octopussy."" Man, I must have seen that movie... twice."
Homer,Ooh la la.
Homer,"You look great, sweetheart."
Homer,"Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson. You know, I always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. Since the time you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me."
Homer,"No, no, let me finish. I just want you to know I've always been proud of you. You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself. You helped me understand my own wife better and taught me to be a better person. But you're also my daughter, and I don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you--"
Homer,See? You're still helping me.
Homer,"Aw, no..."
Homer,I found them on the night stand this morning. I guess they weren't his cup of tea. Don't worry about it.
Homer,"Lisa, Lisa! Where were you!? You missed the most incredible thing!"
Homer,I ate seven pounds of fudge!
Homer,The man at the stand said it was a record!
Homer,I rode the teacups! Then I got a little sick and I had to sit down. But then I rode 'em again!
Homer,Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?
Homer,Did they?!
Homer,"Hmm, I guess Bart's not to blame. He's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and I've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'."
Homer,"My ""Best of Ray Stevens featuring The Streak"" album! So it was the dog that buried all our stuff!"
Homer,Oh my God! He's got the precious cable TV cable!
Homer,"Well, problem solved."
Homer,You got it.
Homer,"Don't worry. We'll catch him, or run him over tryin'."
Homer,"Don't worry. As soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. Believe me, I know."
Homer,Two bucks to win on number eight... ...and have you seen my beloved dog? Gimme the ticket.
Homer,We can't lose. Look at the name of the dog I bet on.
Homer,"You're lucky you got looks, Marge."
Homer,"Yes! Come on, you little horse!"
Homer,"Aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. He misses casual sex."
Homer,Now it's two sets of twins.
Homer,"Yes, we've waited many years, but the good Lord has finally blessed us with a real family."
Homer,Get that cat out of the way!
Homer,Ooh... this time... Ah...
Homer,Do you have a better idea?
Homer,"How do you explain the culottes, boy?"
Homer,Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies away.
Homer,Mainly your mother.
Homer,Splendid. Who's coming?
Homer,Who wouldn't?
Homer,"Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but you can't have these dogs. Am I fired?"
Homer,"A little too well, if you ask me. I'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies."
Homer,"Marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds."
Homer,Lousy teachers. Trying to palm off our kids on us.
Homer,"Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way."
Homer,"Well, it's always in the last place you look."
Homer,I know. And this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. It just keeps going faster and faster.
Homer,"I'm with you, Marge. Lisa, get in here! In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics."
Homer,"So, how was everybody's day at school?"
Homer,"Marge, anyone can miss Canada... all tucked away down there."
Homer,"Well, I've had just about enough of your Vassar bashing young lady."
Homer,"Oh, this is wonderful! You're alive!"
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Really? Wow.
Homer,"Kids are so naïve. Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says ""Do Not Feed The Bears,"" man, you'd better not feed the bears."
Homer,"Now get to school, boy."
Homer,"Man, these are primo seats. I could really go for a hot dog."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Oh, right."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?"
Homer,"Oh I'm sure he knew. And I'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy."
Homer,"Well, it's like the time that your cat, Snowball, got run over."
Homer,"Remember, honey?"
Homer,"What I'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman."
Homer,I blew it again.
Homer,Mmmmmm.
Homer,"Lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, I recommend getting a tattoo. It preserves the things you love."
Homer,Starland Vocal Band?! They suck!
Homer,And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog.
Homer,Jazz. They just make it up as they go along. I could do that. Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.
Homer,"OK, then this. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... doo doo doo doo doo doo"
Homer,They're butchering the classics. Could that bassoon have come in any more late?
Homer,"Laser effects, mirrored balls. John Williams must be rolling around in his grave."
Homer,We're outta here!
Homer,"Whoa, careful now. These are dangerous streets for us upper-lower-middle-class types... So avoid eye contact, watch your pocketbook and suspect everyone."
Homer,Woo hoo! Easy money!
Homer,Then how come that guy's winning?
Homer,"Twenty on this one, my good man."
Homer,No Marge!!
Homer,"Marge, are you okay?"
Homer,"Yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman."
Homer,"Easy now, sweetheart. Homie's here."
Homer,You did what?!!
Homer,Nothing. I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
Homer,"Marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. And I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing."
Homer,"Aw, thanks, honey."
Homer,"Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there. You've become very dear to me."
Homer,"Oh Marge, one squirt and you're south of the border."
Homer,Mmm. Incapacitating.
Homer,"Shush, dear, you'll wreck Daddy's fun."
Homer,". Fooled you Flanders. Made you think your family was dead. Didja get it? They're not, though."
Homer,But you thought they were.
Homer,That's why it was so funny. But they're not.
Homer,"""The Girls of the Internet."" Ooh, I'd go on line with them any day."
Homer,"Are you kidding? Being a cop-husband is one mighty sweet deal: this police radio entertains me with other peoples' miseries; we get a free funeral for Marge, God forbid; and I can run background checks on whomever I want Mohammar--"
Homer,"Hey, hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've got you clocked at two miles per hour."
Homer,"All the more reason to hurry up. Hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --"
Homer,"Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies."
Homer,"Oh, you've become such a cop! And, not that long ago, you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs."
Homer,You're cooking what for dinner?
Homer,"Hey, Marge. How's my little piglet?"
Homer,"That's okay. I'm supposed to be workin', too."
Homer,"I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to get some beer for those kids over there."
Homer,I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
Homer,"C'mon, we're family."
Homer,"I'll make you a deal. You rip up that ticket, and I'll give you back your hat. Wuh, wuh, wuh! Hee, hee-hee!"
Homer,"What're you gonna do about it? What're you gonna do? Ooh, I'm Officer Marge, I'm gonna arrest you! Whoa! etc."
Homer,"Whuh! Marge, not here. Hey, you're not really arresting me...?"
Homer,I choose to waive that right.
Homer,Lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.
Homer,"I have nothing more to say to you, Marge. I'm drawing a line down the center of the house à la ""I Love Lucy"" -- you stay on your side and I'll stay on my side."
Homer,"Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the Police Academy, I thought it'd be fun and exciting, you know, like that movie, ""Spaceballs."" But instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie ""Police Academy."""
Homer,"All right guys, pipe down. I've got some more in the garage."
Homer,Hmm... I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.
Homer,"Well, what do you call it?"
Homer,"Hey Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny - A counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Herman, how could you? We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? Hard working designers, like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt, or Antoine Bugle Boy. These are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, ""me too."""
Homer,"Herman, your beef is with me. Leave the girl out of this."
Homer,"It's too late for me, Marge! Sell the jeans and live like a queen."
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"Oh, Marge. You saved my life! I'm sorry I teased you. You're a really good cop. I'm proud of you."
Homer,"He's gettin' away! You blew it, Marge!"
Homer,"Marge, how did you know..."
Homer,"No, what I was wondering is..."
Homer,"Yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans."
Homer,What for? Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.
Homer,"Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, Son! Tute on!"
Homer,"Now, Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech. If anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. And let's not forget your little speech..."
Homer,"Yes, there is. Come on, everybody, let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves! I got an R.V. we can use... Flanders's!"
Homer,"Pile in, everybody! No time to wipe your feet!"
Homer,Found 'em!
Homer,"You kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this."
Homer,"I don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!"
Homer,That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers. Give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!
Homer,Stupider like a fox!
Homer,I'm okay.
Homer,"This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield. If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower."
Homer,"Oh, great. Now I'm upside-down."
Homer,No one in history has ever done anything this clever.
Homer,"That's okay, son. I'll take care of him."
Homer,"Faster, son -- he's got a taste for meat now!"
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,"Here's your package, Mr. Burns!"
Homer,--son!
Homer,"I hate my job. I mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?"
Homer,What? What's your idea?
Homer,"That's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now Marge?"
Homer,"Well, he's not all bad. He did send me this nice thank-you card."
Homer,"Kids, would you step outside for a second?"
Homer,F-F-F-F-F-F-
Homer,"Stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it!"
Homer,What?
Homer,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Shut up! Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!
Homer,"Oh, you're a dead man! Oh, you're dead! You're dead Burns!"
Homer,He can't remember my name!
Homer,"Berserk is right!! May I have some iced tea, please?"
Homer,"Kids! Kids! Kids! As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers."
Homer,My tool shed! Oh Dad!
Homer,Sure! I've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
Homer,"Hey, I had a damn good reason. He could never remember my name..."
Homer,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson!
Homer,"Me! Me! Me, me!"
Homer,"I swear, I've never seen that gun before."
Homer,"Yeah, right. You chose fruit, you live with fruit."
Homer,No. No. No. Ewww. Why is this on the floor?
Homer,"So you finally learned my name, eh?"
Homer,I've got no time for your demented parlor games! You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you.
Homer,Stop telling them it was me. I'll kill you for saying it was me.
Homer,Say it Burns. Say I never shot you... Before.
Homer,"Yeah. And who the hell are you talkin' to? Marge, do you have other men in this house? Radioactive men?"
Homer,Which one were you? The ugly one?
Homer,Were you the ugly one?
Homer,"Guess what, kids. They're gonna pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here."
Homer,Careful now.
Homer,"Hey, didn't you direct ""Unnatural Discretion""?"
Homer,"Hooey! Whew, oh. You know, I never walk out of a movie, but Eech!"
Homer,You guys work on the movie?
Homer,"Oh, I always wanted to be a teamster. So lazy and surly. Mind if I relax next to you?"
Homer,"Marge, there's a spider near my car keys."
Homer,"Ahhh, that's better. Now that we're alone, Papa Bear has a li'l honey for his Mama Bear."
Homer,"Oh, never you mind..."
Homer,"What advantages does this motorcar have over, say, a train? Which I could also afford."
Homer,No we shan't. Yoink!
Homer,"Oh, we'll clean up this afternoon."
Homer,I got my dad to look after her.
Homer,"C'mon, Honey, you work yourself stupid for this family. If anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you."
Homer,"Yeah. If that mafia guy weren't staring at us, I'd take off my towel."
Homer,I love gettin' away from this dump.
Homer,We leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away?!
Homer,Saxa-ma-phone. Saxa-ma-phone.
Homer,"Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs the hell outta me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a houseplant."
Homer,Lousy houseplant!
Homer,I can see Lisa... but it might be a starfish. I've gotta call 'em!
Homer,"Now wait a minute! Okay, I'm not gonna win Father of the Year. In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. Wait, can I start again? Fathering children is the best part of my day... I'd do anything for Bart and Lisa!"
Homer,"Who? Lady, you got the wrong file."
Homer,"Oh, Maggie. I got nothing against Maggie."
Homer,Communication. Gotcha.
Homer,"Listen. Yes, I know."
Homer,I have listening skills!
Homer,"Shut up, Judge!"
Homer,Garbage in garbage can. Makes sense.
Homer,What I wouldn't give to hear Lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.
Homer,I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now.
Homer,That's it.
Homer,"Todd Smells. Aw, I already knew that."
Homer,Why you cotton pickin' --
Homer,"No! I've gotta pass this class for my kids. Son, let's stop the fussin' and a-feudin'."
Homer,"I love you, Cletus!"
Homer,"Kids, we're good parents now! Get your asses out here!"
Homer,Oh no! In the eyes of God they'll be Flanderseseseses!
Homer,"Okay, okay, don't panic. To find Flanders, I just have to think like Flanders!"
Homer,The Springfield River!
Homer,Son of a bitch...
Homer,Noooooooo!
Homer,"Oh, Bartholemew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan."
Homer,"I said shut your ugly face, Flanders."
Homer,"Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie."
Homer,Yeah! Gimme all the dirt!
Homer,Old painty-can Ned!
Homer,"Hey, Marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn?"
Homer,I'm not ashamed.
Homer,How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?
Homer,I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker!
Homer,Forty seconds? But I want it now.
Homer,"Ow! Help me. Why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?"
Homer,"Hi, is Milhouse home?"
Homer,Mmm. Sounds good.
Homer,"Wow, that's Moe! The guy from the ad!"
Homer,And he knows my name.
Homer,"Bart, you didn't finish your Spaghetti and Moe-Balls!"
Homer,"Run, boy! Run!"
Homer,Run for your life!... ... Boy!
Homer,Why? That was the problem in the first place. You were going broke because we were your only customers. Wasn't that the problem in the first place? That you were going broke... Moe?
Homer,"Moe? Hey, Moe? Oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha?"
Homer,"What was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... Moe? Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... Moe?"
Homer,Let me get a pad....
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,That's the plan.
Homer,"Quiet, boy. I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down."
Homer,"It was good, but not great."
Homer,"Come on, eat the can. Come on."
Homer,"Out of the way, you."
Homer,Aww.
Homer,Hey Flanders!
Homer,Shut up.
Homer,"So, Ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me?"
Homer,I can't believe you didn't invite me after I painted those cool stripes all over your car. I know! I'll throw my own barbecue - the greatest barbecue this town has ever seen! And I'll only invite who I want. That'll show ya.
Homer,Sure.
Homer,"This barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but I'm sure you're up to it, Marge."
Homer,"You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever."
Homer,"Lisa, get a hold of yourself. This is LAMB... not A lamb."
Homer,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, honey -- are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon?"
Homer,Ham?
Homer,Pork chops?
Homer,"Yeah, right, Lisa. A wonderful, MAGICAL animal."
Homer,"Look, kids! I just got my party invitations back from the printer's."
Homer,That's a typo.
Homer,"But all normal people love meat. If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, ""Yo, Goober! Where's the meat?"" I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa. You don't win friends with salad."
Homer,"Wow, Barney! You brought a whole beer keg."
Homer,"I've got the prescription for you, doctor: another hot beef injection."
Homer,One whopper for the copper.
Homer,Here ya go!
Homer,"Okay, everybody. It's the moment you've all been waiting for! The pig de résistance!"
Homer,Thanks Flanders. I have to agree that everything certainly... huh?
Homer,It's just a little dirty -- It's still good! It's still good!
Homer,It's just a little slimy! It's still good! It's still good!
Homer,It's just a little airborne! It's still good! It's still good!
Homer,I know.
Homer,"Lisa, you ruined my barbecue. I demand you apologize this second!"
Homer,That's it! Go to your room!
Homer,"Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?"
Homer,"Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning."
Homer,"Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out."
Homer,"Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case."
Homer,"Bart, go to your room!"
Homer,"I don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all."
Homer,That's it. Go to your room.
Homer,Lisa! Lisa!
Homer,"Lisa! Lisa, come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father I am!"
Homer,I dunno. Were you looking for me?
Homer,"Oh, Lisa, I was looking for you. I wanted to apologize. I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I know it's always my fault."
Homer,Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know?
Homer,"I understand, honey. I used to believe in things when I was a kid."
Homer,"C'mon, I'll give you a piggy-back ride, oops, I mean a veggie-back ride home."
Homer,"Ah, the Miracle Mile -- where value wears a neon sombrero and there's not a single church or library to offend the eye. It truly is a miracle."
Homer,"There it is! The chain that put the ""fat"" in ""fat Southern sheriffs!"""
Homer,I want a colossal donut. Just like the one on the sign.
Homer,Nuts!
Homer,That's false advertising! Lard Lad lied!
Homer,"I paid for a colossal donut, and I'm gonna get a colossal donut."
Homer,Eggheads. What do they know?
Homer,"Hee hee hee. I've got your donut, Lard Lad! And what are you gonna do about it?"
Homer,Get what?
Homer,"Well... I acquired it legally, you can be sure of that."
Homer,Hello? Yes? Oh! Uh... if you're looking for that big donut of yours... uh... Flanders has it. Just smash open his house.
Homer,He came to life. Good for him.
Homer,I told you: Flanders has it. Or Moe! Go kill Moe.
Homer,Well... okay. If it'll end horror.
Homer,Don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time?
Homer,Mmmm.... sprinkles.
Homer,We'll be right back.
Homer,Bart?! Is that you?
Homer,Take out the garbage.
Homer,Lousy Smarch weather.
Homer,Do not touch Willie. Good advice.
Homer,"Oh, no. Better ride this one out in the closet."
Homer,"Oh yeah? Well it's my house, so it's my spot."
Homer,Did not.
Homer,You are?
Homer,They got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.
Homer,Huh? I never looked behind this whatchamacallit case before.
Homer,That's weird. It's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.
Homer,I'll take my chances in the mystery wall.
Homer,Hello? Can anybody hear me?
Homer,I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.
Homer,"Just a second... No, it's a place I've never been before."
Homer,Hey!
Homer,"I don't want to alarm you, Marge..."
Homer,But I seem to be trapped in here.
Homer,What's going on here? I'm so bulgy...
Homer,My stomach sticks way out in front and my...
Homer,"Hey, shut up!"
Homer,Mmm... Unprocessed fish sticks.
Homer,"Man, this place looks expensive. I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here. Better make the most of it."
Homer,"Ow! Watch it, coney."
Homer,Oops.
Homer,Yes.
Homer,Ow!
Homer,"Um, it's like, ahm... did anyone see the movie ""Tron""?"
Homer,"Help me! Are you helping me, or are you going on and on?"
Homer,"Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics. I wish I'd read that book by that wheelchair guy."
Homer,Help! I don't have much time!
Homer,I'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... I'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... I'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! I don't know...
Homer,"Piece of cake, son!"
Homer,Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap!
Homer,Craaaaaaaaaap!
Homer,Eww. This is the worst place yet.
Homer,Omigod...
Homer,"Ooh, erotic cakes!"
Homer,Someone's in here.
Homer,Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo!
Homer,"Yeah! Especially your big fat... Oh, wait."
Homer,TWO!
Homer,Arrgh!
Homer,"Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get out of this?"
Homer,"Stupidity, eh?"
Homer,Must hurt self. Must hurt self. Must hurt self.
Homer,"Hmm, probably better that didn't hit me."
Homer,Hello.
Homer,"Um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?"
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? No. Lumber Lung? No. Juggler's Despair? No. Achy-Breaky Pelvis? No. Oh, I'm never gonna be disabled. I'm sick of being so healthy!"
Homer,"Hey, wait... ""Hyper-Obesity."" ""If you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled."""
Homer,Yes I can.
Homer,"Yuh-huh, that's the deal. No more exercise program! No more traffic! No more blood drives or charity walks!"
Homer,"I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. But try to see it my way. All my life I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body."
Homer,"No. It would only worry her. If you want to add to her worries, go ahead. I guess I'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us."
Homer,"Yes, sweetheart?"
Homer,"Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see about that, Little Miss Smart Guy."
Homer,Can you recommend a doctor who will?
Homer,Of course.
Homer,"What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?"
Homer,"Oh, it's a dream come true, boy! I can, nay, I must, eat everything I've always wanted. Now c'mon! Every second I'm out of bed, I'm burning precious calories. Now get grabbin'!"
Homer,I don't know... fish sandwich? Are you sure?
Homer,"Oh, two-twenty-five?! That means I lost weight!"
Homer,Woo hoo! Four more pounds and my dream comes true: Working at home...
Homer,Any time I want.
Homer,"Hey, Flanders, bad day at the rat races?"
Homer,"Hello, honey."
Homer,"I was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- Honey, I'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability."
Homer,"So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow."
Homer,Beautiful. G'night.
Homer,I've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or I gotta face another day at work.
Homer,I need a miracle.
Homer,"Oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut..."
Homer,"Well, that's a plus."
Homer,Woo hoo hoo hoo! I did it!
Homer,Oh my.
Homer,"Oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting."
Homer,Thank you for your pity.
Homer,I'm looking for something loose and billowy. Something comfortable for my first day of work.
Homer,"Well, I use a computer!"
Homer,I don't want to look like a weirdo. I'll just go with a muu-muu.
Homer,I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas-brake-honk. Gas-brake-honk. Honk-honk-punch. Gas-gas-gas.
Homer,Eight fifty-eight. First time I've ever been early for work. Except for all those daylight savings days. Lousy farmers.
Homer,"""To start, press any key."" Where's the ""any"" key?"
Homer,"I see essc, ctarl, and pig-up. There doesn't seem to be any ""any"" key. All this computer hacking is making me thirsty. I think I'll order a Tab."
Homer,Check core temperature? Yes-slash-No. Yes.
Homer,"Core temperature normal. Not too shabby. ""Vent radioactive gas?"" N-O."
Homer,Venting prevents explo-si-on. This is hard. Where's my Tab? Okay then -- yes. Vent the stupid gas.
Homer,Bart and Lisa have to go to school while I get to stay home. Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah.
Homer,"Well, why don't you live in it then?"
Homer,"Yes, honey?"
Homer,You dragged me all the way from work for that?
Homer,I...
Homer,Pro: I'm drought and famine resistant.
Homer,"Pro: I, uh... don't have to go to work."
Homer,Pro: Uhh... uhh... I love you?
Homer,"Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of, right here."
Homer,"And nobody's gonna take it away from me! You never had faith in me before. But let me tell you, the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead. Now I'm a big fat dynamo. And where's that cake?"
Homer,Vent radioactive gas?... Y-E-S.
Homer,Sound alertness horn? Y-E-S.
Homer,"""Decalcify calcium ducts?"" Well, gimme a Y. Gimme a--"
Homer,"Hey, all I have to type is ""Y."""
Homer,"Hey, Miss Doesn't-Find-Me-Attractive Sexually-Anymore. I just tripled my productivity."
Homer,"Y... Y... Y... Let's see, so many letters to choose from. I'll pick Y."
Homer,"Y, Y... What the heck are you doing over there?"
Homer,There. There. You found the floor.
Homer,YYY... Y... Y... Y...
Homer,Could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer--
Homer,The mail! The mail is here!
Homer,"Oooo! ""An Urgent Plea From Edward James Olmos!"" ""Lisa Simpson: Can you afford to miss another issue of The Utne Reader?"" Kids."
Homer,Free sample of fabric softener? Woo hoo!
Homer,"Hmmm, I can feel three kinds of softness."
Homer,"Washing my fat guy hat, honey."
Homer,"Hey, what are you kids looking at?"
Homer,Don't make me close the shade!
Homer,Nuts to that. I'm going to the movies.
Homer,I got someone to cover for me.
Homer,"One for ""Honk,"" please."
Homer,What are you talking about?
Homer,I could sit in the aisle.
Homer,"Shame on all of you. Give me my dignity! I just came here to see ""Honk If You're Horny"" in peace."
Homer,"Oh, that's raspberry."
Homer,"This may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food! I'm sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes! The overweight individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and hard-working as everybody else. And they're gonna make their voices heard! All they need is a leader!"
Homer,"I'll work harder than ever before, and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined, lazy, and irresponsible! What happened to my bird?"
Homer,Marge?... Lisa?... Flanders?...
Homer,Explosion imminent?!
Homer,"Omigod, the plant's gonna explode!"
Homer,"Wait, I know! ""Vent Gas."""
Homer,Pressure too high?
Homer,Tank must be shut down manually?! Stupid bird! I never should have put you in charge! Why you...
Homer,"Oh, who am I kidding? It's all my fault."
Homer,Shut up!
Homer,I gotta call the plant and warn them!
Homer,"I'm gonna have to shut it down myself. Fat, don't fail me now."
Homer,The ice cream man!
Homer,"Get away, dammit! Run for your lives!"
Homer,Let go! I gotta get to the tank!
Homer,Stupid switch! I wish I had my reaching-broom!
Homer,Wait a minute! There's probably a --
Homer,"Thank you, Mr. Burns. It was pretty scary up there. But... For a while I feared for my life."
Homer,Mr. Burns... Can you make me thin again?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Hey everybody! Up here!
Homer,"Right away, Mr. Smithers! I'll just walk across these slippery rooooock --"
Homer,"Best six hundred bucks I ever spent. C'mon, boy. We've earned this Saturday, now let's make the most of it."
Homer,Sixty-one... Sixty-two... Sixty-three...
Homer,That's m'name.
Homer,"Listen here. My name is Homer J. Simpson. You guys think I'm dead, but I'm not. Now I want you to straighten this out without a lot of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo-jumbo."
Homer,"I don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator. What do you have in that secret government file, anyway? I have a right to read it."
Homer,"""Wife: Marjorie. Children: Bartholomew, Lisa..."" Aha! See, this thing is all screwed up. Who the heck is ""Margaret"" Simpson?"
Homer,"""Youngest daughter..."" Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive. She died when I was a kid."
Homer,You see that stone angel up there? That's my mother's grave. My Dad points it out every time we drive by.
Homer,"Oh, Mom. I'm sorry I never come to see you. I'm just not a cemetery person."
Homer,Here lies... Walt Whitman?!!
Homer,"Damn you, Walt Whitman! I... hate... you... Walt... freakin'... Whitman! ""Leaves of Grass"" my ass! Wait a minute. Maybe it's that other grave. The one that says ""Simpson."""
Homer,Why does my death keep comin' back to haunt me?!
Homer,"I hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. Hey, wait a minute... Mom?"
Homer,I thought you were dead.
Homer,Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd. I can't believe you're here. Dad always told me you died while I was at the movies.
Homer,"Yeah. Well, where have you been all this time?"
Homer,"Mom, there's something you should know about me. I almost always spoil the moment."
Homer,I'm sorry.
Homer,"Hey, everybody, I've got a big surprise for you! Presenting: my mother!"
Homer,I'll Kwaanza you!
Homer,This is my room. This is my dresser. It's where I keep my shirts when I'm not wearing them.
Homer,You remembered.
Homer,"Oh, I've missed moments like this... Mom."
Homer,"Hey, Mom, lookit me! Look at what I can do!"
Homer,Mo-om! You're not looking!
Homer,Woo hoo! I'm so glad to have my mom back! I never realized how much I missed her.
Homer,But?
Homer,"First, it wasn't 25 years. It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason."
Homer,I 'unno. I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.
Homer,Then why did she leave me?
Homer,I thought I dreamed that kiss.
Homer,"Wait a minute. There's one thing I don't understand. In all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?"
Homer,"Oh, come on, Mom. We use that same line on the kids when they're at camp."
Homer,Any undelivered mail for Homer J. Simpson?
Homer,Hey!
Homer,Seven!
Homer,"Rhetorical, eh? Eight."
Homer,"Do I know what ""rhetorical"" means?!"
Homer,You could live with Grampa again.
Homer,"Mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?"
Homer,"It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster. But who are you, and why did you tip us off?"
Homer,Thanks.
Homer,Yak yak yak yak yak.
Homer,At least this time I'm awake for your goodbye.
Homer,Don't forget me.
Homer,That Sideshow Mel thinks he's so big. Whatever happened to Sideshow Bob?
Homer,"Oh, yeah... But what I'll mainly remember is the laughter. I wonder what he's doing now?"
Homer,Free Duff! Viva life!
Homer,"They didn't have any aspirin, so I got you some cigarettes."
Homer,"Heh, heh. Why jerk my neck around like a goon when Tyranno-Vision decides what I should look at?"
Homer,"Oo, look, it's Maggie!"
Homer,Uh... Maggie?
Homer,"Go back to Massachusetts, pinko!"
Homer,"Okay, so we can't go over the fence."
Homer,"I'm sure they're fine, honey."
Homer,"Hang on, boy! Daddy's comin' to save ya!"
Homer,"Well, I wrecked the gate but you don't hear me bragging. Now let's roll."
Homer,"Jump, boy! I gotcha!"
Homer,"Now you, boy!"
Homer,"Well, goodnight, son."
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Relax. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind.
Homer,"Good night, son."
Homer,We may be the best parents in the world.
Homer,Goodnight.
Homer,There's nothing to worry about. Now everyone go to sleep. Good night.
Homer,Do I smell cookies? Where's the cookies?
Homer,Somebody ate those cookies.
Homer,I think she's trying to tell us something.
Homer,"Go on, Maggie. Go. Go."
Homer,Wake up everybody! It's World War Three!
Homer,"Quick, down to the fallout shelter! The bombs are dropping!"
Homer,"Eighteen seconds, hmph. If this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. Say, you're all shivering. Are you cold or what?"
Homer,"Bart! Bart! Time for your Sunday night bath, boy!"
Homer,"Bart! Where are ya, boy."
Homer,Aha!
Homer,"There you go. Now that's not so bad, is it?"
Homer,Hello. My name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,"Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!"
Homer,"Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic."
Homer,Yabba dabba doo!
Homer,"SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE"
Homer,"Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard."
Homer,I'll take care of this.
Homer,Ants!
Homer,"...""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something, something."
Homer,Don't mind if I do.
Homer,"Ooh, sorry. Here's another one."
Homer,"But it won't make you unhappy, right? Hey! Space Food Sticks! Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure! Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom?"
Homer,"No, I work at the nuclear power plant."
Homer,"Well, you'll be happy to know I don't work very hard. Actually, I'm bringing the plant down from the inside."
Homer,Woo hoo! Ow!
Homer,"No it doesn't, it's funny. Their clothes are different from my clothes. Look at what they're wearin'."
Homer,"Bart, you're coming home."
Homer,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst."
Homer,"Young man, in this house, we use a little word called ""please""..."
Homer,"I know how you feel, Bart. When I was your age, I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. Well, goodnight."
Homer,"Gotta change Maggie! Dear God, we gotta change Maggie!"
Homer,Hmmm. We didn't have a message when we left. How very odd.
Homer,"Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada?"
Homer,"'Tis the season, Marge! We only get thirty sweet, noggy days, then the government takes it away again!"
Homer,"Oh, no, I'm not."
Homer,Hey! I don't remember saying that!
Homer,I wanna price some flip-flops and smell the new tires and consult the pharmacist for some free medical advice!
Homer,Uh-oh. Somebody's got tired little legs.
Homer,"Hmm. Wonder where the flip-flops are.... ""Menswear?"""
Homer,"Maybe it's ""Sporting Goods""... Wait, no, ""Sleepwear""... Oh, probably ""Better Living."""
Homer,"Well, maybe someone will give you one for Christmas..."
Homer,Pfft. Must have been a pretty slow century.
Homer,What are you doing to my son?!!
Homer,"Stealing?! How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain what's-his-name? We live in a society of laws. Why do you think I took you to all those ""Police Academy"" movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Where was I? Oh yeah, stay out of my booze!"
Homer,"I've figured out the boy's punishment. First: he's grounded. No leaving the house, not even for school. Second: No eggnog. In fact, no nog period. And third, absolutely no stealing for three months."
Homer,"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
Homer,"Check it out, boy! It's like looking into a living snow mirror!"
Homer,"Get 'im, Ma!"
Homer,"Ooo! ""Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions""! I'm great at these. Ask me if something smells funny in here, boy."
Homer,"I don't think so, stupid!"
Homer,"No, I want roast beef, you clod!"
Homer,The All igh-ty ollar? I get it.
Homer,Ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they've got their mistresses.
Homer,"Well, you're closing. It's getting late. My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. There's gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe. Think."
Homer,I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wannabe a league bowler.
Homer,"Hey, we can be a team!"
Homer,Woo hoo! We won! We won!
Homer,"Excuse me, but my ""team"" is ready to bowl."
Homer,Uh...
Homer,That longhair freak's bowled with us for years.
Homer,"Five hundred dollars?! No problem. Would you take an out-of-state, two-party bad check?"
Homer,"Aw, come on, Marge! You're getting something in return! And I'm getting a bowling team. It's win/win!"
Homer,"Burns never gives money to anybody. Just last week, I asked him for fifteen hundred dollars."
Homer,"Ooh, I've got to get the third degree from you, too?"
Homer,"Uh... Excuse me, Mr. Burns?"
Homer,"Mr. Burns, I, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars."
Homer,"Hey, everybody, if you want to ask Burns for a favor, now's the time! He's doped up or dyin' or something!"
Homer,"Oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us."
Homer,"C'mon, guys. Let's be the team that supports each other. YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / HELP EACH OTHER OUT, THAT'LL BE OUR MOTTO..."
Homer,"DOMO AREGATTO, MISTER ROBOTO..."
Homer,"Lemme set the scene for you, Marge."
Homer,It's a 7-10 split.
Homer,The hardest shot in bowling. It was all up to me.
Homer,"So I got up all my courage. Right away, my lips started to move and I came up with a chant that won the match."
Homer,"I don't know. You know, some guy. Otto, I guess."
Homer,"Marge, you're missing the point. The individual doesn't matter. It was a team effort and I was the one who came up with the whole team idea. Me."
Homer,But... but...
Homer,"There it is, boys, the championship trophy!"
Homer,"Ah, ha, ha, ha, God-boy couldn't get a strike."
Homer,"Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night! They just plain sucked! I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!"
Homer,Gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening.
Homer,Then what are you dressed like that for?
Homer,"""They made us!"" That's loser talk! You gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! Nothing's gonna stop us now!"
Homer,"By the way, rhyming Homer with Homer..."
Homer,You want to join my what?
Homer,"Look, guys. It's not that simple, he's my boss. I'll tell you what: I'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no."
Homer,Welcome aboard. It wasn't any easier.
Homer,"Uh, Mr. Burns, next week is the big championship game..."
Homer,"Aw, Marge, we were so close to winning the championship. Now thanks to Burns it's never gonna happen. And I spent so much time building that trophy case."
Homer,So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? -- Woo hoo! I won't need this any more!
Homer,Marge! Someone broke the toilet!
Homer,"Mr. Burns, as team captain, it's my duty to inform you that..."
Homer,Awww.
Homer,You're off the team.
Homer,Thanks.
Homer,"Goodbye, trophy."
Homer,"I guess some people never change. Or they quickly change, and then quickly change back."
Homer,Saturday afternoon TV is so boring.
Homer,"Marge, I'm bored."
Homer,Because I'm trying to reduce my boredom.
Homer,Eh. I'll do it anyway.
Homer,"Come on, boy, we're going to see the neighbors."
Homer,Good ol' Evergreen Terrace. The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates.
Homer,It's easier. Duh.
Homer,"Uh, spray the boy."
Homer,"Well, ready for the big rummage sale?"
Homer,"Hey, I never noticed this place!"
Homer,"Hey! What's wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot. Too good to buy a house here, Snobby?"
Homer,The guy who doesn't live there.
Homer,"But, Marge, it works on any Ayatollah! Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi... Even as we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power!"
Homer,"Marge, that's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun. I need it to rhinestone-up my old clothing."
Homer,"Oh. I wanted to write ""DISCO STUD"" but I ran out of space. Not that ""Disco Stu"" didn't get his share of the action!"
Homer,"Uh, hey Ned, lemme help you with that."
Homer,Hey everybody! Who thinks Flanders should shut up?
Homer,"So, anyone here from... Evergreen Terrace?"
Homer,I think this is the best neighborhood in town. Anybody agree with me?
Homer,Say. That Ayatollah thinks he's better than America. Is he right?
Homer,"Well, for only five dollars you can sock it to him in style!"
Homer,And for the man who has everything: a tie rack motor!
Homer,"Hey, big spender! / Dig this blender! / Rainbow suspenders!..."
Homer,"Hey, big spender!..."
Homer,Spend some dough at Table Three!
Homer,"Thank you, neighbors, thank you! Now let's give it up for Table Five! Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Five, Table Five... Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Fi-i-i-i-i-i-ve..."
Homer,"Table Five, Table Five..."
Homer,"Hey, what's the big deal? It's just some new guy moving in!"
Homer,"Okay, let's give it up for the new guy. Now let's all turn around and pay attention to me again. Hello? Hello?"
Homer,Why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him. Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot.
Homer,Stupid president. Why couldn't he just stay in his own state?
Homer,"Wait a minute. If Lisa didn't vote for him, and I didn't vote for him--"
Homer,"I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle. After that, I became deeply cynical."
Homer,"Oh, look at those phonies, sucking up to Bush."
Homer,I guess you might say he's barking up the wrong bush. Heh heh heh.
Homer,"Oh, man, I've only got one minute 'til they stop serving those Breakfast Balls..."
Homer,"Hey, jerk! Move your fanny!"
Homer,Hey! My taxes paid for that horn!
Homer,"All right. His story checks out. Marge, would you love me more if I were president? 'Cause I'll do it if it will make you happy."
Homer,"Well, you can always depend on that."
Homer,"He spanked you? You, Bart Simpson?"
Homer,"First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way I talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! Well, that's it!"
Homer,"Hey, Bush! Get out here!"
Homer,I'm going to punch George Bush in the face!
Homer,You owe me an apology!
Homer,"Oooh? Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush? Oooh! Well, you are a wimp."
Homer,"Oh, I want trouble all right."
Homer,"No, you're gonna get trouble."
Homer,Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.
Homer,Trouble it is.
Homer,This is gonna be sweet. Two hundred bottle rockets and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window.
Homer,Yoo hoo?
Homer,"It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush. Come outside, Dad!"
Homer,"Okay, son! Give him the glue!"
Homer,He's not lost.
Homer,It's time to hit him where he lives.
Homer,Bingo.
Homer,"So I thought to myself, what would God do in this situation?"
Homer,"It's all in the Bible, son! It's the Prankster's Bible!"
Homer,"For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!"
Homer,You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! Never!
Homer,"Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?"
Homer,"Woo hoo! In your face, Bush! Now apologize for the tax hike."
Homer,Former President Gerald Ford? Put 'er there! I'm Homer Simpson.
Homer,Do I ever!
Homer,"Yes, Mr. Ford!"
Homer,"Jerry, I think you and I are gonna get along just fi--"
Homer,"Oh, he wants that corn so much!"
Homer,Sit down! / You're breaking -- / Don't touch that--
Homer,Yay!! We're getting a new TV!!
Homer,"Look at these low, low prices on famous brand name electronics!"
Homer,"I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it. And look, there's Magnetbox and Sorny."
Homer,"Sold! You wrap it up, I'll start bringin' in the pennies."
Homer,You look great.
Homer,Spurlock's Cafeteria it is.
Homer,What's the point of going out? We're just gonna wind up back here anyway.
Homer,But Sipowicz does it.
Homer,I wish I was Sipowicz.
Homer,Simpson family.
Homer,"Uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your Mom's done fitting in."
Homer,"You should've held out longer, boy."
Homer,"Boy, Marge, you must've really done a number on those rich suckers."
Homer,That's one way.
Homer,Not an issue.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Really?
Homer,"Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap?"
Homer,"Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, Marge?"
Homer,Seat down.
Homer,"Oh, this game could mean big things for me, Marge. If I beat Mr. Burns, I mean really wallop him bad... I'm sure to get that big raise I've been gunning for."
Homer,"Good morning, Mr. Burns. Beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?"
Homer,Yes.
Homer,Woo hoooooooooo--
Homer,"Mmm, open-faced club sand wedge..."
Homer,He got to the green in one shot?!
Homer,How - can - that - old - man - hit - SO - FAR?!!
Homer,And what are you doing with his ball?
Homer,And all those other balls?!
Homer,"These aren't reptile eggs! You've been cheating! No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green!"
Homer,So you're not the best golfer here! Wait'll I tell everyone about this! You stink!
Homer,Bull-honkey! I don't care about joining this stupid club.
Homer,I'm driving up to the main building. They've got valet parking tonight.
Homer,"But Marge, valets. For once, maybe someone will call me ""Sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene."""
Homer,"I'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. You know, the one I tried to say on the radio? Heh, heh, who's gonna bleep me this time?"
Homer,"I just won't say anything, okay, honey?"
Homer,"You kids should thank your mother. Now that she's a better person, we can see how awful we really are."
Homer,Our savings?!
Homer,"They have beer and gum, right?"
Homer,Poor Aunt Hortense... woo-hoo... woo-hoo...
Homer,"Well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts."
Homer,"Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts."
Homer,Best night's sleep I ever had.
Homer,"Um, I'll have four Tax Burgers, one IRS-Wich -- withhold the lettuce -- three dependent-sized sodas and a FICAccino."
Homer,Hey Marge -- what were your gambling losses last year?
Homer,"Yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans."
Homer,Wow.
Homer,"Don't worry, son. I'm sure he's up in Heaven right now, laughing it up with all the other celebrities -- John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Joseph Stalin... I wish I were dead."
Homer,"Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy. People die all the time. Just like that. Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. Well, good night."
Homer,"Hey, they need volunteers to play old-timey people in the parade. Look, I can be a butter churner, a typhoid carrier... an apprentice! I think I'll be an apprentice, Marge."
Homer,That's for my master to decide.
Homer,You think so?
Homer,"Ah! Well, if you kids believe in me that much, I'll give it my best shot."
Homer,"You su-diddily-uck, Flanders! Gimme that!"
Homer,Hear ye! Hear ye! Ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by all! Chooseth Homer Simpson and he shalt rock thy world!
Homer,"Less chat, more hat."
Homer,"Woo hoo! Hear ye! Hear ye! The Homer Broadcasting System is on the air! All hollering, all the time! I'm gonna make the..."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Hear ye, hear ye! What's for breakfast?"
Homer,"I don't understand thee, Marge."
Homer,"No tongue, eh? How did he talk and eat and laugh and love?"
Homer,"Yes, that'd do."
Homer,The dastard!
Homer,"I believe you, honey."
Homer,"Of course I do. You're always right about this type of thing, and for once, I want in on the ground floor."
Homer,"Well, nice talking to you."
Homer,Lisa?
Homer,"I've been called a greasy thug too, and it never stops hurting. So here's what we're gonna do: grease ourselves up real good, and trash that place with a baseball bat."
Homer,But you have proof! We could go get that confession out of Jebediah's fife.
Homer,"Come on, we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case."
Homer,"Town Crier. I'd like to ask you a few questions. One: where's the fife, and two: give me the fife."
Homer,"Oh yeah? Well, put this in your fife and smoke it!"
Homer,"Oh, sure I do. I always believe in helping the little guy, and you're the littlest guy I know."
Homer,"No, it's Homer."
Homer,I'm just waitin' for my kid.
Homer,"Okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. I know a much better way to get attention..."
Homer,"Hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about Jebediah Springfield."
Homer,"DIG HIM UP! Dig up that corpse!! If you really love Jebediah Springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong!"
Homer,Dig up his grave! Pull out his tongue!
Homer,What do we win if the tongue is there?
Homer,What a jip.
Homer,"Hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. Let's go home."
Homer,No! Nooooooo!!
Homer,"Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I'm supposed to be the responsible one. I shouldn't have let you let me get carried away."
Homer,Get lost!
Homer,"Hear ye, HEAR YE, HEAR YE!!"
Homer,All right! Liver!
Homer,I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when I'm around.
Homer,"Um, is this the chair I'll be sitting on?"
Homer,"Uh-huh. But this is the chair, right?"
Homer,Mr. Burns has a mother!? She must be a hundred million years old!
Homer,"Heh, heh. Taft, you old dog..."
Homer,"Uh, Mr. Smithers? I don't understand 2700 of my new duties."
Homer,"Um, what do I do in case of fire?"
Homer,Just my luck.
Homer,"Uh, Smithers already left, Sir. I'm his replacement, Homer Simpson."
Homer,But I think the dodo went extinct...
Homer,"Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? The things?"
Homer,Lousy two-legged pants.
Homer,I know. I'm taping it. I want to get to Mr. Burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.
Homer,Hmmm. One of these must be a breakfast maker.
Homer,"Well, it's my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damned breakfast he ever ate!"
Homer,Uh... they all won.
Homer,"Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep."
Homer,"Yes, Sir, I did."
Homer,The accounting department is located on the third floor. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The head of this department is a Mr. Johnson or Johnstone.
Homer,"Here are your messages: ""You have 30 minutes to move your car,"" ""You have 10 minutes,"" ""Your car has been impounded,"" ""Your car has been crushed into a cube,"" ""You have 30 minutes to move your cube."""
Homer,Hello. Mr. Burns' office.
Homer,It's Mr. Smithers. He's calling for you.
Homer,"Yes! Yes, sir!"
Homer,"I'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir."
Homer,"No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to do some long division."
Homer,Yello?... It's for you.
Homer,No.
Homer,Except... I killed Mr. Burns.
Homer,I punched Mr. Burns right in his 104 year-old face.
Homer,Mr. Burns?
Homer,"I'm really sorry I hit you, Mr. Burns. Here, let me put some salt on that eye."
Homer,"Yes, sir."
Homer,"Hi, Mr. Burns. Do you want your coffee now?"
Homer,"Well, can I at least drive you home, Mr. Burns? It's five o'clock."
Homer,"Would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you, sir?"
Homer,"Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you?"
Homer,You shouldn't've gone away on vacation.
Homer,"I just feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired. That job was all he had. Imagine how you'd feel, Marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do."
Homer,"Mr. Smithers, wait!"
Homer,"You can't let yourself end up in a place like this. You've got two choices: You can give up on yourself and take the Barney-guarding job, like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments. Or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back."
Homer,"Okay, I gotcha covered."
Homer,You're on.
Homer,Got it.
Homer,"I'm transferring a call into you, Mr. Burns."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Hello, Mr. Burns? This is your mother."
Homer,"Son, this is Mrs. Burns! I just called to say I don't love you. You are a bad son, Montel!"
Homer,"You really blew it this time, Smithers."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,I'll show you.
Homer,For knocking Mr. Burns out a third story window.
Homer,What am I -- a doctor?
Homer,"Bye, kids. On your way back, pick up a six pack of beer."
Homer,"Oh, why can't they just take the gun?"
Homer,Will do.
Homer,"Aw, nertz."
Homer,Which one's Itchy? The car?
Homer,Oh. I guess that's not him then.
Homer,"Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger."
Homer,All right... Wait a minute. For what?
Homer,Forget it.
Homer,Okay. Grampa.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Woo hoo! Look, Marge! A couple of bucks!"
Homer,What for?
Homer,Oh... Forget it.
Homer,"Well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... So to answer your question, I don't know."
Homer,"Yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?"
Homer,"You know, his bizarre ""personal"" life? Those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium? Why I heard..."
Homer,Troy McClure? He's a washed-up movie star. He could be dating washed-up supermodels.
Homer,"Oh, I love legitimate theater."
Homer,Down in front!
Homer,"I know! I know! It's Selma, right?"
Homer,"Aw, hell. Well... What about Dracula?"
Homer,"Troy, buddy, I gotta know. What's a great guy like you wanna marry a guy like Selma?"
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Hey, look what I snagged, Marge -- the candy bride and groom from the wedding cake."
Homer,Mmmm... pointy.
Homer,"That reminds me -- Troy said something interesting last night at the bar. Apparently he doesn't really love Selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Well, enough talk. Let's snuggle."
Homer,"Marge, could you close your eyes? I'm trying to sleep."
Homer,'Cause they won't hire an assistant.
Homer,Donut?
Homer,This has purple stuff inside. Purple is a fruit.
Homer,"Uh... Oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country. As a safety inspector, I am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs."
Homer,I'm sorry. I guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,"Boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person!"
Homer,"Oh, Diablo Canyon 2... Why can't you be more like Diablo Canyon 1?"
Homer,"Hi, Lisa. How's your Spring Break going?"
Homer,"Oh, owls, eh? So you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me..."
Homer,You made it! Did you have any trouble getting past the security guards?
Homer,Great! Ya wanna get some lunch?
Homer,"The way I figure it, if the candy stays in the machine for more than a year, it's up for grabs."
Homer,"Well, it's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here I trust. Ready?"
Homer,They all have hilarious names and are delicious.
Homer,"Boy, Lisa, with you here this hardly seems like work at all. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through my nightshift without you."
Homer,"Oh, that'd be great! Sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... It'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store."
Homer,Eh... Truth. Ask me anything.
Homer,"All right, dare."
Homer,"Hello, I'd like to speak with a Mr. Snotball? First name, Ura?"
Homer,"What?! How dare you! If I find out who this is, I'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to Iran!"
Homer,"Okay, your turn."
Homer,Ummm... Do you have a crush on anyone?
Homer,I won't tell anybody.
Homer,"Moe thinks he knows a lot more than Moe knows! Well, just give me another chance, and I'll prove I can keep your secrets."
Homer,I have no idea who that is.
Homer,"I've already forgotten his name. It was Larsen something, right?"
Homer,"What's wrong, honey?"
Homer,"Uh, you don't have to tell me, but I thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. I mean, I haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend."
Homer,I promise.
Homer,"Yes, that's a real pickle. Would you excuse me for a moment?"
Homer,"All right, I have thought this through. I will send Bart the money to fly home, and then I will murder him."
Homer,"Okay, we'll work this out together. First things first: where is Knoxville?"
Homer,"Well, maybe we could order something from Oak Ridge..."
Homer,"Y'ello, Oak Ridge? This is Springfield Nuclear. We need to order a... uh...T-437 Safety Command Console."
Homer,"And have it sent to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, care of Homer J.--"
Homer,Forget the name Homer Simpson. Have it sent care of... Langdon Alger.
Homer,Helms Calls for Donut Tax?!
Homer,There. Done and done.
Homer,"Oh, why did I have to stop at the railroad tracks? Better get some change."
Homer,"It's okay. It's okay. I'm back. See, Daddy's here."
Homer,"C'mon, Maggie, maybe if you just squeeze a little..."
Homer,"That's it, that's it, I..."
Homer,"Okay. Okay. Think, Homer..."
Homer,... The dog!
Homer,"Okay! Go, boy! Go find help! Go find help, boy!"
Homer,"Oh, bad dog! Bad dog!"
Homer,"Oh, don't worry, Maggie! I'll think of something!"
Homer,Maybe it's time we put Grampa in a home.
Homer,"Second class? What about Social Security, bus discounts, Medic-Alert jewelry, Gold Bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? Oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet."
Homer,Who is it?
Homer,Bart's room.
Homer,Where are you two going at this hour?
Homer,"Oh, can I come?"
Homer,Pass.
Homer,"Looks like bad news for the... ...""Impson"" family."
Homer,"Let's all calm down. Everyone's going to be just fine, as long as I've got enough beer."
Homer,"All right, that does it. If I'm gonna be trapped inside the house I gotta go out and buy some beer."
Homer,Now to drop gracefully through the windshield.
Homer,I'm sick of these constant bear attacks! It's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.
Homer,"Hey -- if you want wild bears eating your children and scaring away your salmon, that's your business. But I'm not gonna take it! Who's with me?"
Homer,WE'RE HERE! WE'RE QUEER! WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BEARS!
Homer,"Oh, I heard it at the Mustache Parade they have every year."
Homer,"Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears."
Homer,"Ahh, not a bear in sight. The bear patrol must be working like a charm."
Homer,"Thank you, Honey."
Homer,"Oh, how does it work?"
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,"Lisa, I want to buy your rock."
Homer,"Woo-hoo! A perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck!"
Homer,Hey... how come my pay is so low?
Homer,Bear Patrol Tax: $5?! What?! This is an outrage! It's the biggest tax increase in history!
Homer,Let the bears pay the bear tax. I pay the Homer Tax.
Homer,"Well, anyway, I'm still outraged."
Homer,"Open your eyes, Lisa. Our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like Bart have lost the will to learn."
Homer,"Yeah, when those immigrants get deported, there'll be more elbow room for regular Joes like you and me, Apu."
Homer,You? Pfft. I don't believe it.
Homer,"Oh my God. I got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of Proposition 24, I never stopped to think it might affect someone I cared about."
Homer,"You know what, Apu... I am really, really gonna miss you."
Homer,Yeah. Those are exactly my sentimonies.
Homer,"Low and lazy, so -- Hey! Say something again."
Homer,"Hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue."
Homer,Don't forget Ganesha.
Homer,"Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!"
Homer,I never should have bought this button. Can I have my three dollars back?
Homer,"Hey Marge, look what I brought home."
Homer,"No, Marge. Apu convinced me that Proposition 24 is a big mistake."
Homer,And I'm not registered!
Homer,"Hello, Selma? Selma my dear? How are you? Uh-huh... uh-huh... uh-huh... Listen, shut up for a second. How would you like to marry Apu so he doesn't get deported?"
Homer,"Oh. It can't be that many. C'mon, Apu. I'll be your tutor."
Homer,Please identify this object.
Homer,Correct. Now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. But why does the American flag have precisely 47 stars?
Homer,Uh... partial credit.
Homer,"Now, they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the U.S, so let's do that. Uh, Springfield, Springfield... Ah, right here."
Homer,"No, no, and no. Maybe we should start all over with the electrical college."
Homer,"Sleep is for the weak, Apu! Now I'm gonna go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history."
Homer,What?
Homer,"Yeah, native Americans like us."
Homer,"Hi, everyone. If I could just say a few words... I'd be a better public speaker."
Homer,"Now that you're all relaxed... Most of us here were born in America. We take this country for granted. But not immigrants like Apu. While the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid, they're driving the cabs that get us home safely..."
Homer,They're writing the operas that entertain us every day...
Homer,"They're training our tigers, and kicking our extra points... These people are the glue that holds together the gears of our society."
Homer,"If we pass Proposition 24, we'll be losing some of the truest Americans of all."
Homer,"When you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote ""NO"" on Proposition 24!"
Homer,NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO - ON - TWEN - TY - FOUR!
Homer,When are people going to learn -- Democracy doesn't work!
Homer,Well we'll have to organize a carpool. Every day will be like a road trip!... With your dad!... To school!
Homer,"So how 'bout those rainbow suspenders, huh?"
Homer,"Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?"
Homer,"I see these kids now with ""jive"" printed on their shirts. Now, I can teach you how you're supposed to say ""jive""..."
Homer,"I'm watching the road, sweetie. ""You jiiive turkey!"" See? You got to ""sass"" it. ""Quit jiiiving me, turkey!"" You gotta ""sass"" it. A turkey is a bad person."
Homer,"But this is Grand Funk Railroad! You guys back there know Grand Funk, right?"
Homer,"Nobody knows the band, Grand Funk? The wild shirtless lyrics of Mark Farner? The bong-rattling bass of Mel Schacher? The competent drumwork of Don Brewer? Oh, man."
Homer,"For more information on Grand Funk, consult your school library!"
Homer,"And when I listen to a really good song, I start nodding my head, like I'm saying ""yes!"" to every beat. ""Yes, yes, yes this rocks!"" And then sometimes I switch it up like ""No, no, no, don't stop a-rockin'..."""
Homer,"No, I'm not. I'm teaching you about rock music."
Homer,"Now -- Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson Airplane, which cleared the way for Jefferson Starship. The stage was now set for the Alan Parsons Project, which I believe was some sort of Hovercraft..."
Homer,I'm just trying to party with you guys.
Homer,"Hi there! Been a while since I set foot in Good Vibrations Music. Where can I find the latest releases by ""Bread?"""
Homer,Oldies?
Homer,"But you've got all the top bands in here. Styx? I just heard them on ""The King Biscuit Flour Hour."" Now here are some of your no-name bands: Sonic Youth, Nine Inch Nails, Hullabalooza..."
Homer,"There can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the US Festival."
Homer,The US Festival! Geez! It was sponsored by that guy from Apple Computers.
Homer,Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. It's a scientific fact.
Homer,"Back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible."
Homer,"But most of all, I remember the music."
Homer,You make me feel like dancing...
Homer,"You wouldn't understand, Dad. You're not with it."
Homer,"No way, man. We're gonna keep on rocking forever... forever... forever..."
Homer,Forever... forever... forever...
Homer,"I went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music I'd never heard of. It was like the store had gone crazy."
Homer,"That's fine for you, Marge. But I used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. Then it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. I've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!"
Homer,I did? I must be getting forgetful in my old age. Open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.
Homer,Well... what have we here? Looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to Hullabalooza.
Homer,"You're not going to school today. Today, your classroom will be the Capitol City Amphitheater. Your teacher? Four dozen rock bands. So get ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your father. Woo hoo!"
Homer,"Oh, my homemade Kahlua."
Homer,"Hey, a freak show!"
Homer,"Oh, I get it."
Homer,"Hey, I've been safari-in' since before you were born."
Homer,"Well, excuuuuuuse me!"
Homer,"Well, Homer, this is it. Time to get back with the people. The young people."
Homer,Alright. Yeah.
Homer,"Cool concert, am I right?"
Homer,What did I say? What's going on?
Homer,"Okay, I'm heading out now! More butt support! More butt support!"
Homer,"Oh, it makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly I'm uncool. I've been kicked out of paradise."
Homer,I'll never be part of the scene again!
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,I'm fine.
Homer,"I don't think I have a choice, Marge."
Homer,How do you figure?
Homer,"You know, Marge, in some ways you and I are very different people..."
Homer,"Hi, everybody. Is everybody... good?"
Homer,Thank you. Thank you very much.
Homer,"""Stay in school. Your hero, Homer."""
Homer,"Homer Simpson, smiling politely. You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your gloomy music they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I can't possibly provide."
Homer,All is well on tour with America's most popular alternative music festival...
Homer,Our first job is to entertain...
Homer,...and I like to think sometimes we get a message across as well.
Homer,"But the main thing is, I've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes rock 'n' roll the king of musics."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Hello, ticket-holders!"
Homer,"Thank you! And remember: Don't trust anyone over thirty. And now, Peter Frampton!"
Homer,"We've got a little rule back home: if it's brown, drink it down; if it's black, send it back."
Homer,"Really? Me, too. But I got kicked out 'cause of my views on Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors."
Homer,"Anyway, get ready, beer belly! We're gonna show Springfield what we're made of!"
Homer,That was odd.
Homer,No biggie. I'm cool.
Homer,Rules. I'm a rocker. I don't care for rules.
Homer,"Die? Well, you don't scare me, Doc. 'Cause dying would be a stone groove. Got any messages for Jimi Hendrix?"
Homer,"People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great."
Homer,Nope.
Homer,"You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- Christianity."
Homer,What's with all the questions?
Homer,"Sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do."
Homer,...so I realized that being with my family is more important than being cool.
Homer,"Oh, this is heavy. Okay, Homer, don't fear the Reaper."
Homer,"Oh, I'm gonna die."
Homer,"Oh, Marge. I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but all I wanted was a club sandwich."
Homer,You have a desk?
Homer,"I'll miss you Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak world view. I've got too much to live for."
Homer,"You know what the song says, ""It's hip to be square."""
Homer,So lame that it's cool?
Homer,"Wait, Marge. Maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool."
Homer,I only get two weeks of vacation a year -- and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house?
Homer,"Deal. See, Flanders, you give a little, you get a little."
Homer,"Lisa, let's go!"
Homer,"Hey. Hmm, somebody's travelin' light."
Homer,"Well, I have been eating more..."
Homer,"Bye-bye, job."
Homer,"""Wel-diddly-elcome Simpsons."" Oh, geez. He actually wrote ""diddly."""
Homer,I left a few helpful notes around the house...
Homer,I'll take that.
Homer,"I forgot my swimsuit, too. But I improvised."
Homer,Hello.
Homer,"It's low tide, boys."
Homer,"Ooh, Captain of the Football Team! He's a dreamboat! Don't wait up, Marge."
Homer,"Hey, he looks just like you, Poindexter!"
Homer,"You've got friends. You got ""The Dud"" right here. Stand up for yourself, Poindexter!"
Homer,"Hmm. I bet this place sells illegal fireworks. Just go in and act casual, like you buy 'em all the time."
Homer,"Um... let me have one of those porno magazines... a large box of condoms... a bottle of Old Harper... a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas. No, make it two."
Homer,All right.
Homer,"This baby's sure to kill something. Okay, now everybody -- stand back while I celebrate freedom. Bart, give me your matches."
Homer,No lighter?... Nothin'?
Homer,"Wait, I got it."
Homer,The beer!
Homer,Sweet merciful crap! My car!
Homer,"Well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids."
Homer,"Attic? Oh, that's silly. Seriously, though, don't ever go up there."
Homer,"Yeah, yeah. I'll go feed it."
Homer,"Fish heads, fish heads, do de do de doo..."
Homer,No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do I -- what?
Homer,"Yeah, three nosy kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions?"
Homer,"See, Marge? Who needs a car wash when you can just drive around in the rain."
Homer,"Oh my God, Marge, it's escaped!"
Homer,"Lisa, please. Yes, Bart, you have a twin brother. You see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity."
Homer,We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.
Homer,"We'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to."
Homer,"Right. Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game."
Homer,We think we saw Hugo at the airport! He was boarding a plane to Switzerland and... Oh.
Homer,"Lookin' good, son."
Homer,"Ahh, the ole fishin' hole. So peaceful and relaxing, it doesn't even matter if I catch a single fish."
Homer,"Come on, you stupid fish! Take the bait! Don't make me come down there!"
Homer,What the-- whosa-- sonofa-
Homer,Oh my God... space aliens! Don't eat me! I have a wife and kids! Eat them!
Homer,"I suppose you'll want to probe me. Well, might as well get it over with."
Homer,"I guess you mean President Clinton. He usually hangs around Washington, D.C."
Homer,"Except... um, there's this election next week, so after that it might not be him anymore. It might be what's-his-name, uh, Mumbly-Joe... uh, I saw him on TV the other... Uh, Bob Dole."
Homer,Oh no. Aliens... bio-duplication... nude conspiracies... Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!
Homer,No! NO! What are you spraying me with!?
Homer,"Marge, Marge! There I was, I had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when I was abducted by a flying saucer!"
Homer,That's one of the creatures!
Homer,These candidates make me want to vomit in terror! I've got to stop them!
Homer,Stop! Those candidates are phonies!
Homer,You heard me -- They're alien replicons from beyond the moon!
Homer,"Oh, why won't anybody believe my crazy story?"
Homer,Hold on guys. I'll help ya!
Homer,"I'm Homer Simpson, Sir, and I'm gonna get you back to Washington before it's too late!"
Homer,Oh no! What have I done? What am I doing? What will I do?!
Homer,It's in Cypress Creek. Upstate somewhere.
Homer,"Oh yeah. So long, Stinktown."
Homer,"America, take a good look at your beloved candidates! They're nothing but hideous space reptiles!"
Homer,Don't blame me. I voted for Kodos.
Homer,"Marge! I've got a new job! It's with Globex Corporation. I get more money plus health benefits, for me and my life partner. And they'll move us and give us a nice house and..."
Homer,Of course not. I wouldn't do that. Why not?
Homer,"But Marge, this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream."
Homer,Promise not to laugh? I always wanted to own the Dallas Cowboys.
Homer,"Just bring the rut with you, honey. Come on, take a look."
Homer,"Ah, let's watch something else."
Homer,"Oh yeah, that's right. Let's watch this."
Homer,"Well! What do you think of me and Cypress Creek now, Marge?"
Homer,Thank you! Come again!
Homer,We'll never sell this rotten dump.
Homer,Heeeeey...
Homer,Yes.
Homer,Okily dokily.
Homer,I'm gonna miss Springfield. This town's been awfully good to us.
Homer,"Here we are, 15201 Maple Systems Road... Our new home."
Homer,Wow! My boss!
Homer,Okay...
Homer,"Yes, once."
Homer,Wowww.
Homer,"Yes sir, I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion."
Homer,Wow.
Homer,Uh... to work for you?
Homer,Um... Someday I'd like to own the Dallas Cowboys.
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Ye... No.
Homer,Don't worry. That won't take long.
Homer,All right.
Homer,Doh!
Homer,Are you guys working?
Homer,"Could you, um... work any harder than this?"
Homer,"Hey, call me Homer."
Homer,"Hey, what's with you sad sacks?"
Homer,"Mr. Scorpio says productivity is up 2%, and it's all because of my motivational techniques, like donuts and the possibility of more donuts to come."
Homer,"Tom Landry's hat! And it's autographed! ""To Berman's Dry Cleaning, Best Wishes, Tom Landry."""
Homer,I can't buy that. Only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. Guys like me? I'm a guy like me!
Homer,"All right, team, it's the fourth quarter. The Lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!"
Homer,"Hey, if Tom Landry's hat doesn't motivate you, then I should just quit right now."
Homer,"Tired, eh? What you guys need... is hammocks."
Homer,All right... What's the number?
Homer,"Sir, I need to know where I can get some business hammocks."
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,Got it...
Homer,Umm-hmmm...
Homer,Yes...
Homer,Right...
Homer,"Oh, the Hammock District."
Homer,Fine.
Homer,Yes.
Homer,Oh.
Homer,No?
Homer,Any sugar around here?
Homer,Uh... yessir. No problemo.
Homer,France.
Homer,I've never noticed this office before.
Homer,"Eh, you have any sugar around here?"
Homer,Eh... I... no.
Homer,Aargh!
Homer,Well...
Homer,I tackled a loafer at work today.
Homer,"Well, the Simpson men are doing fine, right, Bart? You haven't even gotten in trouble at school."
Homer,"What?! We've got it great here. And for the first time in my life, I'm actually good at my job. My team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions."
Homer,"Uh, I've got a problem, Hank."
Homer,"Well, it's pretty important."
Homer,"Say, what's going on?"
Homer,"Aw, those jerks. Always walking over the small businessman. Don't get me started about the government."
Homer,"Well, my family wants to move back to Springfield."
Homer,Nothing big. It's just a lot of little things.
Homer,"Well... Thanks for everything, Hank."
Homer,"""Project Arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you. This will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. It's not the Dallas Cowboys, but it's a start. Drop me a line if you're on the East Coast, Hank Scorpio."""
Homer,"Aw, the Denver Broncos."
Homer,Yeah yeah.
Homer,"You just don't understand football, Marge."
Homer,"Look, Marge! They opened a new high-tech gadget store! You love high-tech gadgets!"
Homer,Like bull you don't! Come on!
Homer,"No, I'm not!"
Homer,"Marge, look!"
Homer,The World's Best Jacket! If I had this it would show everybody... show everybody!
Homer,"Hey, what happened to your belt?"
Homer,"Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. You've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start."
Homer,"Yesss, they are a clever bunch. I know, I'll squeal for you. To their parents."
Homer,The thing is -- oof! -- Bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!
Homer,Big deal. I didn't even get my kid's belt back. The only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
Homer,Really?
Homer,Dressing?
Homer,You really think I could do it?
Homer,Yes!
Homer,Yes!
Homer,YES!!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Wow! I've never been in here before!
Homer,You used to be a boxer just like me?
Homer,"Hey, what's this?"
Homer,"You know Lucius Sweet? He's one of the biggest names in boxing! He's exactly as rich and as famous as Don King, and he looks just like him, too."
Homer,Why not?
Homer,Lousy Democrats.
Homer,No problemo.
Homer,"Oh, why me?"
Homer,Just a second.
Homer,All right... Ready... Wait a minute... All right... Wait a minute... Just a sec...
Homer,Then I can just push him over.
Homer,No one.
Homer,Never.
Homer,Nothing.
Homer,"Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?"
Homer,"Gee, thanks, Moe... What's this?"
Homer,You... didn't?
Homer,"Uh, sure."
Homer,"Ooh, ""General!"" Who's Drederick Tatum, anyway? Is he another hobo?"
Homer,"Well, I trust you, Moe. If you say I can beat this guy, then he doesn't stand a chance."
Homer,"Uh, well... I was gonna surprise you, but, um... happy anniversary, baby!"
Homer,"Aw, c'mon, I'll make a fortune for one night's work! We could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --"
Homer,"Marge, will you let me finish? ...Plug-in room deodorizers, front and rear spoilers for the car --"
Homer,"Well, I don't think it's that unlikely."
Homer,"All right, I think we've heard just about enough from Mr. Newspaper today."
Homer,Gotcha.
Homer,"Okay, Homer, nothing to be worried about... just--"
Homer,Are you an angel?
Homer,But you stopped the fight. Won't everyone be mad at you?
Homer,"Aaar, matey."
Homer,I can't remember where we parked.
Homer,"Eh, not mine."
Homer,Where are you going?
Homer,"Yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today."
Homer,Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
Homer,Can't they get a pole for that sign?
Homer,"Ooh, let's pick him up!"
Homer,And what if he's not? Then we'd look like idiots.
Homer,"Oh, yes we are!"
Homer,"Oh, yes, there is!"
Homer,"And I think it's the best idea I've ever had! We're picking up the weirdo, and that's final."
Homer,He made fun of my weight.
Homer,"Hey, you're that hitchhiker! What are you doing here?"
Homer,"Wow, that's really lazy."
Homer,So lazy.
Homer,"...and Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than you and me. If I could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be Larry!"
Homer,Why? It's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.
Homer,"Yes, sir. I do."
Homer,"Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He's a little wiener who..."
Homer,"Eh, I should go."
Homer,It's so unfair. You're everything a dad could hope for.
Homer,"Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you. And that... is a phony kidnapping."
Homer,Pho-ny kid-napping...
Homer,"Hiding out? Marge, you've been reading too many hideout books."
Homer,Of course not. We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
Homer,"Hello, Mr. Burns, this is the kidnapper. Do you miss your son?"
Homer,"If you really love Larry, prove it and you can have him back today."
Homer,Don't you care about your son? This is more important than money!
Homer,Just a second.
Homer,No!
Homer,"Marge, it's not a real kidnapping. It's a simple hoax to win a father's love."
Homer,Still?
Homer,"What... But... Marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!"
Homer,The abandoned warehouse!
Homer,Stupid economic recovery!
Homer,We've gotta find someplace no one will ever go. Hel-lo!
Homer,"Heh-heh, they'll never look for us here."
Homer,"You don't like it, call the cops!"
Homer,"It'll be okay, honey. There's lots more oil where that came from."
Homer,"Hold on, Mr. Burns. Maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love."
Homer,"I'm a father myself, sir. And sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky --"
Homer,-- but they can always count on one thing: their father's unconditional love.
Homer,"It's a party, Marge. It doesn't have to make sense."
Homer,"Sorry, sorry. My fault."
Homer,Someone found my keys!
Homer,No problem... Can do.
Homer,Right... Uh huh... Gotcha... Cat in the furnace.
Homer,A whole week of just father and son! See you at dinner.
Homer,"You know, I don't know."
Homer,All right. Just wake me up.
Homer,"No, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda."
Homer,"Geez, look at this place. We gotta do something."
Homer,Do I have to sit up?
Homer,Knock yourself out.
Homer,Just a minute!
Homer,Hello.
Homer,I have misplaced my pants.
Homer,"'Preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. And I gotta live with him."
Homer,"No! Wait! Wait! Madam, I run a house of discipline. The boy will be disciplined, and disciplined severely. Good day."
Homer,"Oh, I don't know how to punish you! What does Marge usually do?"
Homer,"C'mon, boy. Give your old man a little credit."
Homer,"Yeah, well, I still get to punish you."
Homer,"Now, you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the damage you did. It's called responsibility."
Homer,"I told you last night, no! Where is Bart, anyway? His dinner's getting all cold and eaten."
Homer,"Bart, where are you?! Come on! I have to be up at six a.m. to swipe Flanders' newspaper!"
Homer,"What the... ""President Eisenhower celebrates 40th wedding anniversary... Not pictured: Mrs. Eisenhower."""
Homer,I don't care if he was filling in for Mel Zetz! He's my son and I don't want him --
Homer,working... so... late... that...
Homer,"Yes, everyone loves rules..."
Homer,"Oh, yeah, drugs. Ya gotta have drugs."
Homer,"Uh, this isn't gonna be about Jesus, is it?"
Homer,"Helen, as a responsible parent, I was already well aware of that."
Homer,"Oh, no?! Well, if Homer Simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then Homer Simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! That's..."
Homer,"Hi! Now, Marge, you're going to hear a lot of crazy talk about Bart working in a burlesque house..."
Homer,No! I only learned that four days ago.
Homer,"I was trying to punish him exactly like you would. So, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. This is your mess and I'll be damned if I'm gonna clean it up!"
Homer,"Don't you worry, son."
Homer,My friends! Stop!
Homer,"Sure, we could tear this house down..."
Homer,No! My friends! Stop!
Homer,"Let me finish. We could tear it down, but we'd be tearing down a part of ourselves..."
Homer,"You could close down Moe's or the Kwik-E-Mart, and nobody would care / But the heart and soul of Springfield's in our Maison Derriere..."
Homer,"What are you doing, Marge? Didn't you hear the song?"
Homer,Take it off!
Homer,Hey...
Homer,Easy...
Homer,"Marge, can't we get some clear plates? I can't see the TV."
Homer,Yoink.
Homer,"Keep it down in there, everybody."
Homer,"Yup, pretty much. Except we drove around in a van solving mysteries."
Homer,"Oh, I hate having parties. The toilet always gets backed up."
Homer,"Oh, we can't afford that. Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?"
Homer,"Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here."
Homer,Whaaaaaat?!
Homer,I just gotta put my shoes on.
Homer,"You know what you two need? A little comic strip called ""Love Is."" It's about two naked eight year olds who are married."
Homer,Shut up and let the woman talk.
Homer,Boring!
Homer,"Ooh, here we go!"
Homer,That's a door?
Homer,"G'night... Thanks for coming... We'll see you... Ba-bye... Well, I think that went pretty well."
Homer,"Marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago."
Homer,You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once and move on.
Homer,The one down the hall.
Homer,I sleep in a big bed with my wife.
Homer,Thanks for introducing me.
Homer,What the hell is wrong with you?!!
Homer,For what?
Homer,I don't wanna go to that.
Homer,That doesn't sound like something I'd say.
Homer,Okay. Love you.
Homer,"Can I Borrow A Feeling? ""Can I Borrow A Feeling?"" There's your picture on the front."
Homer,I already did.
Homer,Oh yeah. You gotta do that.
Homer,"Oh, and for yourself."
Homer,It can't just be sex. It can't.
Homer,"Ooh, that's tough, pal. But it's never going to happen to me."
Homer,'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
Homer,"Marge, I'm home! Where are you? Are you okay? I don't smell dinner!"
Homer,"""Dear Homer,"" aww. ""Sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. I left you hot dogs for dinner. They're thawing in the sink."""
Homer,"Lisa, wait! I know you're only eight years old and I don't wanna put a lot of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage."
Homer,All right.
Homer,"As you know, there's been a lot of talk about divorce lately, and I think your mom might not be happy with me."
Homer,'Cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.
Homer,Mm-hm.
Homer,"Oh, I knew this would happen. Our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot."
Homer,That's your advice?! Go to bed!
Homer,"Good morning. You know, Marge, I was thinking about how much I enjoy your interests, so I wandered over to that theater you went to last night. And I bought tickets to their entire season."
Homer,"Look -- ""Mostly Madrigals."" Hey, that might be good. Ooh, ooh, ""An Evening With Philip Glass."" Just an evening? ""Voices of the Elderly Poor."""
Homer,"Oh, of course, my sweet. I'll just make some soothing ocean sounds for you."
Homer,I wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer 'do. How many husbands would do that for their wives?
Homer,Ooh! You're feisty. I'm gonna give you a Madonna cut.
Homer,"Oh, I've just made things worse. A few clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for 10 years of neglect. Marge deserves someone who will treat her right. Marge deserves a fresh start."
Homer,"I'd like to file, for divorce."
Homer,Marge? Can you come in here? We need to talk.
Homer,"Marge, will you marry me?"
Homer,"No, it's a second wedding, Honey. Our first one was so crummy, I had to make it up to you. I really love you."
Homer,"Yes, we do. I got us a divorce this afternoon."
Homer,"I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV. This one is for real. I want our marriage to be perfect, right from the start, so we don't end up like Kirk and Luann."
Homer,Wait! I want one last chance to enjoy single life.
Homer,"Okay, ready."
Homer,It doesn't matter. All I want to know is: Will you make me the luckiest guy in the world... again?
Homer,"Eh, mornin', Apu."
Homer,Whaddya mean?
Homer,"Well, it was like that when I got here. It really was."
Homer,"Hey, what's this thing?"
Homer,"Telemarketing, eh?"
Homer,I won't.
Homer,Let me show you how it works. This baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. It automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. Listen.
Homer,Now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in!
Homer,Tele-panhandling.
Homer,Woo hoo! Two dollars! It's working!
Homer,"Oh, no you don't!"
Homer,Will you two shut up?! People are trying to sleep!!
Homer,Lisa's window is the next one!
Homer,Shut up!!
Homer,"Hey, who shot the auto-dialer? Marge's auto-dialer?"
Homer,... Is it... Wah?
Homer,"Oh, Lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting Springfield."
Homer,"What is it, boy? Fire? Earthquake? Hippies?"
Homer,Hurricane! Somehow the animals are always the first to know.
Homer,"Oh, I'm sure I'd be a third wheel."
Homer,I would make it my business to be a third wheel.
Homer,"Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill. Everybody into the cellar!"
Homer,Use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it.
Homer,"All clear, everyone."
Homer,Relax. Can't you see how eerily calm it is?
Homer,See? I told you it was over.
Homer,Hmm. I don't remember a bowling alley being th--
Homer,"He fell for it! Way to go, Marge!"
Homer,Now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.
Homer,Talk to me!!
Homer,"Well, call us if you need anything."
Homer,"Hope you like it, neighbor. We didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love."
Homer,The living and dining rooms... with a lovely flow for entertaining...
Homer,"Eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad."
Homer,"Your beautiful kitchen, Ned. Just as you remember it."
Homer,"So, Flanders, what do you think of the house that love built?"
Homer,"Aw, shoot."
Homer,"Hey, I got off pretty easy."
Homer,Beer! Gimme some beer!
Homer,"Yello? Yes... Mental hospital? I don't know any ""Ned Flanders."""
Homer,"Oh, him."
Homer,I... What?
Homer,"""Ned Flanders, I mock your value system. You also appear foolish in the eyes of others."""
Homer,Past instances in which I professed to like you were fraudulent.
Homer,I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other. Now that's psychiatry! Eh? Eh?
Homer,"Aw, that's it. You just can't insult this guy. You call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning moronly."
Homer,"You know what your problem is, Flanders? You're afraid to be human."
Homer,Because humans are obnoxious sometimes. Humans hate things.
Homer,"C'mon, Flanders. There's got to be something you hate. What about mosquito bites?"
Homer,"What about, uh, fluorescent lights?"
Homer,See? You like everything.
Homer,"Ned, you so crazy."
Homer,"Oh, why do they have to put all this crud in my newspaper? ""World""... ""The Arts""... ""Religion"" Aha! Here it is: ""Kickin' Back!"""
Homer,"Hey, who cut something out of my paper?"
Homer,"Hello? Oh, hi, Lenny... No. Why would I need a ride this afternoon?"
Homer,Where? To the big annual what?
Homer,"Lenny? Aw, well. If it was big and annual I'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper."
Homer,"Yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon. But something's a little off..."
Homer,"Hey, Marge, you don't smoke!"
Homer,You're nuts. I gotta get some fresh air.
Homer,"What's wrong with you? What are you trying to hide from m-- What's that smell? Onions... Chili powder... Cumin... Juicy ground chuck... It's chili! Oh my God, I'm missing the Chili Cook-Off!"
Homer,I'm missing the Cook-Off! It's going on right now and I'm missin' it!
Homer,Look at me! I'm a puffy pink cloud!
Homer,"Oh, well, of course... everything looks bad if you remember it. Now where are my chili boots? Ah!"
Homer,"Okay, quit naggin' me. I won't have any beer. Geez, why don't you have a cigarette or something?"
Homer,"Marge, we're missing the chili! Less artsy, more fartsy!"
Homer,Fine. I'll come find you when I'm ready to stop having fun.
Homer,Stupor Pooper.
Homer,"Five-alarm chili, eh?"
Homer,"One... two... Hey, what's the big idea?"
Homer,"Hmmm. A bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. Heh, heh, heh."
Homer,"Hello, Chief."
Homer,"Uh, Wiggy...? My chili's gettin' cold."
Homer,Hot! Hot!
Homer,But I need it!
Homer,"Aw, lousy Wiggum. Now the whole town thinks I'm a chili wuss..."
Homer,"Maybe I do, son. Maybe I do."
Homer,Outstanding.
Homer,"More, please."
Homer,"Well, Chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is."
Homer,"Heh, heh! My finest hour! And Marge wasn't even here to see it."
Homer,Ooh. I don't feel so good.
Homer,Flanders! You gotta help me!
Homer,"What's happening to me? Okay, retrace your steps... woke up, fought with Marge, ate Guatemalan insanity peppers. Then I -- Ohhhh."
Homer,Where am I? Shelbyville?
Homer,"Come on, Marge! Will you... Fight fair! I never do this to you!"
Homer,"Man, this is crazy. I hope I didn't brain my damage. I'd better check my pupils..."
Homer,Oh... kay. I think I'm gonna be leaving now.
Homer,"Huh? Sunrise, sunset... Sunrise, sunset... SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET..."
Homer,Note to self: stop doing anything.
Homer,Hey buddy! Get back there with the other rocks!
Homer,Huh? A tortoise?
Homer,Follow... the... This must be why I'm here! Follow the what? Follow the what? Hurry up!
Homer,"Get moving, you stupid... When I'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". Come on!"
Homer,"Oh. You want me to climb that, huh? No problemo."
Homer,"This is 'cause I kicked you, isn't it?"
Homer,Marge! Thank God you're here! Where's the car?
Homer,"Marge? Marge? Oh, now what? If you're still mad at me, I'm gonna be really mad."
Homer,"Aw, I hate this place! Why am I here?!"
Homer,Who said that?
Homer,Hiya.
Homer,"If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of you."
Homer,"Yeah, that's me all right."
Homer,But what should I do? Should I meditate? Should I get rid of all my possessions?
Homer,"You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and I would -- Hey!!"
Homer,Knock it off!
Homer,"Look, just gimme some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya."
Homer,Soul mate?
Homer,"That's it? Well, that's Marge. Big deal. Great spiritual quest, wolfie. My soul mate is Marge."
Homer,"Hey, wait! Come back!..."
Homer,A ghost train! And so little time to get out of the way!... Now less!... Now none!
Homer,"Wha? Golf course? Did I dream that whole thing? Maybe the desert was just this sand trap... Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the Pro Shop!"
Homer,Carl?
Homer,And that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.
Homer,"Hey, wait a minute. There's no such thing as a talking dog."
Homer,Damn straight.
Homer,"Hi, kids."
Homer,Where's your mother?
Homer,"Hi, honey."
Homer,Uh-oh. I guess you're cranky because I didn't come home last night...
Homer,"Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk. I just went to a strange fantasy world. C'mon, you gotta believe me. You're my soul mate."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"That coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but Marge doesn't understand me at all. Maybe we're not kindred spirits. We don't have anything in common..."
Homer,"Look at these records! Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown Pipers! Now look at her records... They stink! Maybe I had that crazy dream for a reason..."
Homer,"Wherever my soul mate is, it's not here."
Homer,"...I always just figured my wife was my soul mate. But if it's not Marge, then who is it? Where do I begin looking?"
Homer,"Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer."
Homer,"Well what about you, Lenny?"
Homer,"Hello? Is this G-B-M? Uh, yeah. I read in the personals you were seeking a soul mate and, well, I also like rainy days and movies. Uh huh... uh, no, I don't like that. Or that. No, it's not that I'm afraid. I'm gonna hang up now. Bye-bye. Oh, I give up."
Homer,Where? Where?!
Homer,Huh. What's that blinking light?
Homer,The lighthouse keeper!
Homer,The loneliest man in the world! He'll understand me!
Homer,Earl. My new friend's name is Earl!
Homer,"Here I come, buddy! No more loneliness for Homer and Earl...."
Homer,"A machine? Earl's a machine. Oh, that's just perfect! Homer's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot! Oh, wow!"
Homer,"Alone! I'm alone! I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!"
Homer,A ship! A ship with people! I know... I'll bring them to me! And then they'll have to be my friends!
Homer,"Come here, people!"
Homer,"Well, I won't be lonely for long...."
Homer,Marge?
Homer,Really? You were? But how did you find me?
Homer,"Or that little guy on the ""Don't Walk"" sign."
Homer,"Wow, Marge, you really do understand me. See, I thought we weren't soul mates because..."
Homer,"Right, and we don't like the same things. It's like you're from Venus..."
Homer,"Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters."
Homer,...But our sames go right down to the bone. Maybe we do have a...
Homer,"Hey... we do! Oh, Marge!"
Homer,"We're number one! We're number one! In your face, space coyote!"
Homer,Omigod! The ship!
Homer,The light! We gotta get the light back on!
Homer,They see us! They're starting to turn!
Homer,We sure did... soul mate.
Homer,"TGIF! Guys, I'm off to Moe's."
Homer,"Don't worry, I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. I think it was called ""The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down."" First, I hook this common VCR into the security camera system like so..."
Homer,"Then, I insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop..."
Homer,"Nah, it's Friday night Moe. I wanna try something special."
Homer,Skoal! Wait a minute -- this is Duff!
Homer,"Hmm, bold -- refreshing... and something I can't quite put my finger on."
Homer,"Well, it's one a.m. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids."
Homer,"Eh, I guess I'll walk home."
Homer,"No time for you, old man!"
Homer,"Please, don't hurt me!"
Homer,Yaaaa...
Homer,Uh!
Homer,"It was an alien, Marge! It appeared in front of me and said, ""Don't be afraid!"""
Homer,"No! Well, ten beers..."
Homer,"I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet."
Homer,"Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo! Explain that!"
Homer,So?
Homer,Oh. It's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!
Homer,"Yes. Remember, it's the same day as the dog's?"
Homer,Lousy loveable dog.
Homer,"Oh, it was awful. They set me on a cold metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes and the -- oh wait, that was my physical."
Homer,The alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like Urkel! And he appears every Friday night -- like Urkel!
Homer,You don't have to humiliate me.
Homer,"No, I'm sorry."
Homer,Yes.
Homer,Ow.
Homer,"Well, the evening began at the Gentleman's Club, where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon."
Homer,We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?
Homer,"You are one fine-lookin' woman, lady. If I wasn't married, I'd go out with you like that."
Homer,"I am so sorry. Whatever you do, don't tell Marge. God, I love her. I-- Hey, a penny!"
Homer,"So I says ""Blue M & M, red M & M, they all wind up the same color in the end."""
Homer,"I was standing right here, when the horrible creature emerged from the woods."
Homer,"Oh, Marge, I've never felt so alone. No one believes me. Uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say ""I believe you, Homer."""
Homer,"You do?! Oh, Marge, you've made me so happy!"
Homer,Thanks! I'd love an omelet right about now.
Homer,"No, I can't. This is my cause. I'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. What was his name? Apollo Creed?"
Homer,"No, I refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks I'm crazy. Unless you're feeling... amorous?"
Homer,"Well then, good night!"
Homer,"Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me, too."
Homer,You do?
Homer,"Thank you, son. And do you think you could stop the casual swearing?"
Homer,"That's my boy. Well, if you believe in me, then I'm not going to give up. I'll prove I'm right. This Friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!"
Homer,We'll fake it and sell it to the Fox network.
Homer,"Now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too."
Homer,I kill me.
Homer,"Now, son, you don't want to drink beer. That's for Daddies, and kids with fake IDs... besides, it's such a beautiful night. How about a ghost story?"
Homer,No! No! No-o-o-o-o!
Homer,"Yeah, me too."
Homer,It's him!
Homer,"As a representative of planet earth, let me be the first to say..."
Homer,Bwah! Bwah! Bwaaaaah!
Homer,It's gone. And we still don't have any proof.
Homer,"Good work, son! We did it! We did it!"
Homer,Marge! Kids! They're about to show my videotape!
Homer,"Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. Any questions at all. Doctor Hibbert?"
Homer,Uh... the second one. Zilliphone. Next question.
Homer,"Uh, yes."
Homer,This interview is over!
Homer,"Take a look at this, Lisa. You don't see any ""Homer is a Dope"" T-shirts, do you?"
Homer,Marge! How could you?
Homer,I'll take two!
Homer,Look! There it is!
Homer,"Thanks, Marge."
Homer,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit now. When are the pancakes coming in the mail?"
Homer,"What do you need to make money for anyway? As long as I have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about."
Homer,Ow! Oh! Call work and tell 'em I won't be in tomorrow.
Homer,"No deal, McCutcheon. That moon money is mine!"
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,"Uh, your fish are dead."
Homer,"Hey, pretzels!"
Homer,"Hey, what's all that commotion outside? Why, it's one of those Pretzel Wagons the movie stars are always talking about."
Homer,"That's right, Lenny. Let's all give in to deliciousness, the Pretzel Wagon way."
Homer,"That means thank you, Marge."
Homer,You could call 'em Whitey Whackers.
Homer,"Marge needs help, and God knows, I'm not the man to provide it. But I know who can..."
Homer,"Aw, looks like Mr. Pretzel Man is doing pretty well for himself."
Homer,I'm here to see Mr. Ormand.
Homer,"Oh, I guess I should speak to the executor of his estate."
Homer,"You're my last hope. I've never reached out to you before, but my wife is in her hour of need. Your help could make all the difference in the world."
Homer,"I had a feeling things would work out for you, honey."
Homer,"Thanks, Moe."
Homer,"Yeah, my wife is raking it in."
Homer,"Hey, Fat Tony! You still with the Mafia?"
Homer,"You mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? Oh, Fat Tony... I will say good day to you, sir."
Homer,In those words? Yes.
Homer,How could I not? I saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. I saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into America's already bloated snack-hole. So I did what I could. I did what any loving husband would do: I reached out to some violent mobsters.
Homer,So what are we gonna do?
Homer,"Oh, thank God. It's only Grampa."
Homer,Now what?
Homer,"You heard her. She said ""no."""
Homer,"But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet."
Homer,Look at him. He's gonna do something. And you know it's gonna be good!
Homer,"You must hate me, Marge. Every time I try to help, I just fail miserably."
Homer,"Hey, that's the fire alarm!"
Homer,"I think I won, Mr. Burns."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Hit 'em, Carl! You too, Lenny!"
Homer,So Burns is going to make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork. Which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around here.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Hmmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but I think we have to go on the retreat anyway."
Homer,"Well, here we are."
Homer,Uh... yes sir. I thought I was supposed to.
Homer,"Uh, I lost my map."
Homer,"Hey, this sounds like fun."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Oooh.
Homer,"Uh, not as such."
Homer,"Yes, lotta hysteria..."
Homer,"Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!"
Homer,"Wow. You sure know how to cheat, Mr. Burns."
Homer,No sir. I am not.
Homer,That worked sooo well.
Homer,No going through the window for us!
Homer,"You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I know. Way richer than Lenny."
Homer,"Oh, these sure are comfortable chairs."
Homer,"Oh, man, you are so right. Did you ever sit like this?"
Homer,Why get up? Here's a little move I've been tinkering with. Say I want that bowl of dip.
Homer,Oh?
Homer,"Use it wisely, my friend."
Homer,"You got it, buddy."
Homer,"Um, I don't see one. Unless..."
Homer,No. There's no way out.
Homer,You can supervise me.
Homer,We sure did!
Homer,I think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.
Homer,Shhh! You're causing more avalanches. .
Homer,I think they've stopped. .
Homer,So what?
Homer,It could be days before they find us.
Homer,We could build snowmen.
Homer,Oh... Okay.
Homer,"Stay back! I have powers! Uh, political powers!"
Homer,Agreed.
Homer,"Uh, they're just snowmen, Mr. Burns."
Homer,What do we do?
Homer,You and what army?
Homer,Burnsie!
Homer,"Oh Lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house."
Homer,"Marge, kids."
Homer,"You said it, ya weirdo."
Homer,"Marge, get me a beer."
Homer,Your mother seems really upset about something. I better go have a talk with her... during the commercial.
Homer,"Oh, Marge I just had a couple of beers."
Homer,Eww.
Homer,"Marge, I was just watching Women's Volleyball on ESPN..."
Homer,Come on. There's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.
Homer,"Oh, There's no way I could --"
Homer,"Now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. I'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. Just like my hair!"
Homer,"Marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it."
Homer,But how am I supposed to pay for that?
Homer,"Good for you, son. Giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. Have a dollar."
Homer,"Didn't he Lisa? Didn't he? Hey, wait a minute, he didn't!"
Homer,"All right, Marge. I'll get you your nanny, and to pay for it... I'll give up the Civil War Re-creation Society I love so much."
Homer,"Wait a minute, Marge. I saw Mrs. Doubtfire. This is a man in drag!"
Homer,You're phony! Fakey phony broad!
Homer,Gimme those.
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,I like him!
Homer,I hide a bottle of Schnapps in the baby's crib.
Homer,You have my undivided attention.
Homer,MIGHT I ADD -- NO FAT CHICKS.
Homer,AND ONE WHO WILL WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE--
Homer,Did you say Mary Pop--
Homer,"Now Ms. Bobbins, if you want this job you're going to have to answer a few questions. First, do you have any bad habits?"
Homer,"Well, so am I."
Homer,Okay. Question two -- who was your last employer?
Homer,"Marge, do we know them?"
Homer,Come on -- isn't he the guy I bowl with? The black guy?
Homer,"Oh yeah. So, you worked for Carl, eh?"
Homer,"Ooh, she is tough."
Homer,I'll say. Her butt waxed the banister.
Homer,"Come to bed, Marge."
Homer,"No, no. Leave it in."
Homer,NOT TILL YOU'RE FIFTEEN.
Homer,"Ooh, I can't get enough of this blood pudding."
Homer,"Blood, uch! I'll just stick to the brain and kidney pie, thank you."
Homer,You've changed me as well. I'm no longer the money-driven workaholic I once was.
Homer,You little...
Homer,Shary Bobbins! I want another beer!
Homer,You'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.
Homer,"Oh, that poor woman."
Homer,Nope.
Homer,Indubitably!
Homer,"AROUND THE HOUSE, I NEVER LIFT A FINGER / AS A HUSBAND AND FATHER I'M SUB-PAR / I'D RATHER DRINK A BEER THAN WIN FATHER OF THE YEAR / I'M HAPPY WITH THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE."
Homer,"SHUT UP, FLANDERS."
Homer,"I'm sure we will, honey."
Homer,I'm sure we will.
Homer,"Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, they're having open casting for the voice of Poochie."
Homer,I do not!
Homer,I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.
Homer,"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin' ""Howdy"" to all the girls out there in radioland."
Homer,"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin'-- I don't sound like that, do I? Oh, I don't like having such a hilarious voice."
Homer,Ruff Ruff! I'm Poochie the rockin' dog.
Homer,"Oh, ""no attitude,"" eh? Not ""in-your-face,"" huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, Ugly!"
Homer,Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did.
Homer,"Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo, I don't get to be a cartoon dog."
Homer,"Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh. Thank you."
Homer,"She smells sheet smells by the sheet store. Wait, wait. Lemme try it again."
Homer,You? But you're a lady.
Homer,"Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?"
Homer,"You mean ""meep meep""?"
Homer,"Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?"
Homer,"I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question: why would a man whose shirt says ""Genius At Work"" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?"
Homer,What the hell are you talking about?
Homer,Quiet! You're missing the jokes!
Homer,Well? What did everybody think?
Homer,"So it was pretty okay, huh?"
Homer,"Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I?"
Homer,I'm the worst Poochie ever.
Homer,Then they said they were gonna kill Poochie off!
Homer,"You're right, Marge! It's not my fault! I'm not gonna let 'em treat Poochie like dirt anymore just 'cause he's the new guy!"
Homer,"Put a sock in it, Roy."
Homer,No I am not.
Homer,Never!
Homer,"You can't just kill off a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm gonna read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands."
Homer,"Yes. I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away, but I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, I know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together."
Homer,"Now, kids -- I know you loved the old Poochie...but the new one's going to be better than ten Superbowls. I don't want to oversell it. Judge for yourselves."
Homer,"Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those finks double-crossed me!"
Homer,"Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live and learn."
Homer,"Nine hundred dollars? Well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again."
Homer,"Aw, nuts. Hel-lo? China? Little help?"
Homer,That is so true.
Homer,What happened?
Homer,Give her a break! Her husband was killed!
Homer,"Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!"
Homer,Fifty bucks for a toy? No kid is worth that.
Homer,"No. How can you love a box, or a toy, or graphics? You're a grown man."
Homer,"Oh, yeah. Like when a clown dies."
Homer,And that kind of stuff is worth money?
Homer,"Man, you should come over to our place. It's full of valuable, worthless crap!"
Homer,"I practically insist. Shall we say, 5 o'clock? The snacking hour?"
Homer,Do I know you?
Homer,Ow! Why you little...
Homer,"Oh. I'll just be another minute, John. Have a seat."
Homer,"So, do those records have ""camp value?"""
Homer,That John is the greatest guy in the world. We've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.
Homer,"Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? Well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there..."
Homer,Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.
Homer,Who doesn't?
Homer,Right...
Homer,"OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! I danced with a Gay! Marge, Lisa, promise me you won't tell anyone. Promise me!"
Homer,"Am I, Marge? Am I? Think of the property values! Now we can never say only straight people have been in this house!"
Homer,"Whoa, not me. And not because John's gay, but because he's a sneak. He should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way."
Homer,"You know me, Marge: I like my beer cold, my TV loud, and my homosexuals fla-ming."
Homer,"No! No, no, no, no..."
Homer,"No, no! I'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!"
Homer,"How'd it go? Tell me everything that happened! He didn't give you Gay, did he? Did he?"
Homer,"Oh, and I'm not."
Homer,Bart! Where'd you get that shirt?
Homer,Uhh... huh.
Homer,"Marge, the boy was wearing a Hawaiian shirt!"
Homer,"There's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts -- gay guys, and big fat party-animals. And Bart doesn't look like a big fat party-animal to me."
Homer,"Right. Thank you. I hope you realize this is all your fault. I mean, do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?"
Homer,"All right, boy! Come on! Today we're gonna--"
Homer,You! I should have known!
Homer,"Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. Just stay the hell away from my family!"
Homer,No.
Homer,"You know. It's... it's not... usual! If there was a law, it would be against it!"
Homer,"No I'm not, Marge! They're embarrassing me! They're embarrassing America! They turned the Navy into a floating joke! They ruined all our best names, like Bruce and Lance and Julian! Those were the toughest names we had, now they're just..."
Homer,"Yeah! And that's another thing! I resent ""you people"" using that word. That's our word for making fun of you. We need it! Well, I'm taking back our word and I'm taking back my son!"
Homer,Homer storms out.
Homer,"Don't worry, boy. We're gonna set you straight. By tomorrow morning, you'll be a regular Burt Reynolds."
Homer,Just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. Father and son.
Homer,"Just remember, son, whatever happens --I'll always love you."
Homer,... as a father! A father!! A regular father!! Whooh!
Homer,Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.
Homer,Well it's been two hours. How do you feel?
Homer,That's a good start. Let's get you a pack. What's your brand?
Homer,"Okay, that didn't work. But I know something that will..."
Homer,"Bart, I want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?"
Homer,Roscoe here runs this mill. He's gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real All-American Joes doin' what they do best.
Homer,You'll thank me on your wedding night.
Homer,Has the whole world gone insane?
Homer,I don't know! This is a nightmare! You're all sick!
Homer,"Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! The whole world's gone gay!"
Homer,"Oh, my God, what's happening now?"
Homer,...and the entire steel mill was gay!
Homer,But what would turn Bart into a man fast? You have to think for me!
Homer,"Hunting, eh?"
Homer,"Stand aside, Marge. I'm taking the boy deer hunting. He's going to grow up straight for once."
Homer,Oh yeah?! How long since you've had a baby?
Homer,It just does! Name me one gay Indian!
Homer,"Butt out, butt-insky! What would you know about hunting?"
Homer,"Hang onto it, Toy-Boy! You might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!"
Homer,"No, boy. You can't drive, you're only 10. You're going hunting!"
Homer,"That is a very immature attitude, young man."
Homer,Well... but... Wait a minute. Bart's not fixed yet! He hasn't even --
Homer,"Oh, she'd never go. She's a vegetarian."
Homer,No... This whole thing is my fault. I've been a lousy dad.
Homer,"Hey, boy, wake up! Your old man found some deer!"
Homer,"Yep, and it's your shot, son."
Homer,"C'mon, Bart. Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?"
Homer,"Bart, I'm gonna turn my back -- and when I turn around, I wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer."
Homer,"Attaway, son! You made your old man proud!"
Homer,"Me too, son."
Homer,"Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- GAAHHH!!"
Homer,UNNGHH!!
Homer,Just... my bones... and organs...
Homer,What the -- ?
Homer,"Bart, look! It's Santa Claus!"
Homer,It's a miracle!
Homer,I've been tenderized.
Homer,"Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you calling him a sissy. This guy's a fruit! And a -- No, wait, wait, wait -- ""queer!"" Queer, queer. That's what you like to be called, right?"
Homer,Amen to that.
Homer,"Y'know, Bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me."
Homer,"He said ""tried""!"
Homer,"Oh, all those stairs..."
Homer,"Your mother's right, Bart. Sure, you're the one who ruined all of Sideshow Bob's criminal schemes --"
Homer,"And sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher you horribly if he could --"
Homer,In a medium-security prison.
Homer,Unless he gets out somehow.
Homer,"Or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before."
Homer,Yeah! You do your own dirty work!
Homer,Lisa too?
Homer,"Well, I hope Bob fed you, 'cause I ate your dinners."
Homer,"Marge, I'm going to look for the kids!"
Homer,"You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend."
Homer,The important thing is I didn't imagine it.
Homer,"Militants, huh? Well, if I were you, I'd kick their asses."
Homer,"Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, Flanders, but uh, Marge was taken prisoner in the... Holy Land and uh..."
Homer,I'll have to ask her.
Homer,Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
Homer,"Oh, it's like a rent-a-car, son. You get all the mileage you can. Then ball it up and cram it through the mail slot."
Homer,Can you see the pie stains?
Homer,"Take it like a man, boy. And do everything your little sister says."
Homer,"Aw, I love this pedestrian mall! There's practically no traffic!"
Homer,"All right, all right, geez. Okay, honey, remember where we're parked."
Homer,You've never been?
Homer,"Nah, I'm really more of a slacker."
Homer,"Look, Marge! A restaurant owned by celebrities! I always wanted to be a celebrity!"
Homer,"Wow, even Moe's moved to fancy new digs."
Homer,"You know, honey, when I think of all the good times we've had together-- AAAGH!"
Homer,"Did you see that, Marge?"
Homer,Don't laugh at me! I was once like you!
Homer,"What's the matter, Marge? I thought you loved Jello shooters."
Homer,"Oh, come on Marge, relax! Lisa's in charge. She's the responsible one."
Homer,"Give me the drugs, Lisa."
Homer,"It's been St. Patrick's Day for hours and I'm still not drunk yet. Oh, it's never gonna be nine o'clock."
Homer,"Oh, Moe, thank God you're here! We'd like to come in and drink, please!"
Homer,Look at me! I'm the Prime Minister of Ireland!
Homer,I'll come with you.
Homer,"Oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. What about that freezer lady in Georgia?"
Homer,Prohibition! They tried that in the movies and it didn't work. I predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition.
Homer,"Glad you're finally back in business, Moe."
Homer,"At first I thought prohibition was a good thing. People were drinking more and having a lot more fun. But without beer, prohibition doesn't work."
Homer,No.
Homer,Now don't say that! Alcohol is a way of life. Alcohol is my way of life. And I aim to keep it!
Homer,"Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do..."
Homer,"C'mon, boy, think of a plan."
Homer,I've got it!
Homer,"We're going out, Marge. If we don't come back, avenge our deaths."
Homer,"Right. Now remember, don't mention this to anyone. Not your mother, not Rex Banner, not anyone."
Homer,"Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope."
Homer,"Hang on, son!"
Homer,Really? I heard good.
Homer,Nothin'.
Homer,"Before! Before! You're living in the past, Marge! Quit living in the past."
Homer,Going bowling. Not back - avenge deaths.
Homer,"Oh, I'm not going to lie to you, Marge. So long!"
Homer,"Yeah, suck like a fox!"
Homer,"You see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism."
Homer,"Wait a minute. I forgot to make sure the coast was clear. Aw, it's probably clear. Let's go."
Homer,"I can explain, Marge! Please let me explain! Oh, why won't you let me explain!!!"
Homer,"Well -- and I can explain, remember -- I fill the balls with beer that I found at the dump, then I bowl them and some underground pipes take them into Moe's."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"It is silly, Marge. And look at all the money I'm making!"
Homer,No you won't.
Homer,Won't.
Homer,"Hey, boy, get crackin'! Moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!"
Homer,Call me Beer Baron.
Homer,But I can't be out of beer. I'm the Beer Baron!
Homer,"Sorry, I'm all out. Wha-- How about some turpentine? Or caulk? Delicious caulk..."
Homer,"""Make it,"" eh?"
Homer,"Forty-two bathtubs, please."
Homer,I said forty-two!
Homer,"Remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust law here. We're patriots. Like... all those people in jail."
Homer,"Hey, Banner, how's it hangin'?"
Homer,"Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have been that bean I had for dinner."
Homer,"Ka-boom! Blam! Oh, excuse me again, dear."
Homer,"What, dear?"
Homer,Ka-BLAMMO.
Homer,Boom.
Homer,I'll be right back.
Homer,It's hot!
Homer,"I thought about what you said, honey, and I've decided to quit."
Homer,"Oh, well... Fun's over, but I still have my wonderful money."
Homer,"Geez, what happened to you, Wiggum? You look terrible."
Homer,"Well, I don't think so. You don't even have a trigger on that thing."
Homer,Poor Wiggum.
Homer,"I'll bet you really hate Rex Banner, huh?"
Homer,The guy who took your job.
Homer,"Hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?"
Homer,"You forgot one thing, Wiggum."
Homer,I filled the balls with a funnel.
Homer,"Aw, probably just a slap on the wrist..."
Homer,Last time I help you.
Homer,"Well, sorry, I'm not in that business anymore."
Homer,"To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!"
Homer,"Alright, men. Get ready to blast off!"
Homer,"Wooo, we're in orbit now! What's that? A call from the president? Hello?... Uh, yes. ""Let me just say this about that."" Okay, Mr. President..."
Homer,Mayday! Mayday!
Homer,"Wait a minute. Bart's teacher's name is ""Krabappel?"" I've been calling her ""Crandall."" Why didn't someone tell me? Oh, I've been making an idiot out of myself."
Homer,"Give me that! Bart, this is your father. Do you know where the remote is? I looked all over the house."
Homer,It was in... It was in my pocket.
Homer,"Hey, does this mean that Mrs. Krabappel is a virgin, too?"
Homer,"Marge, mail's here."
Homer,When? When? Ich bin hungrig!
Homer,"Yes! My precious ""CarTOONS!"" ""Who pumped Ethyl?!"""
Homer,"Marge, mail's here."
Homer,Wow! A golf shirt! With my corporate logo on it!
Homer,"Oh, it smells like salmon, too! Thanks, boy!"
Homer,"Hi Marge, hi Santa's Little Helper, hi kid -- hey, that's not Santa's Little Helper."
Homer,"Wow, I gotta start going to church."
Homer,"Oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day."
Homer,"Geez, that dog has more education than I do. He's some kinda super dog. Hey, where'd he go?"
Homer,"Oh, I don't know about this dog. He's kinda... snooty."
Homer,Do you think he noticed?
Homer,Who?
Homer,"No! Bart had his turn, let me! I can't resist his charms."
Homer,Crowds give him gas.
Homer,"Wow, TV's Kent Brockman."
Homer,"You want some puppies, eh, Mr. Brockman?"
Homer,"I'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable."
Homer,Can do.
Homer,"Laddie! C'mere, boy! Who want to lick a messy baby?"
Homer,Laddie?
Homer,He better know how to keep his mouth shut.
Homer,You gave both dogs away?! You know how I feel about giving!
Homer,"There, there, shut up, boy. We'll just get you a new dog."
Homer,"Well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!"
Homer,Rats. I almost had him eating dog food.
Homer,The bad dog or the good dog?
Homer,Oh good.
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"Hey, I know where there's lots of paper!"
Homer,"Oh, okay."
Homer,Can Lenny have it?
Homer,Now I can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.
Homer,"Oh, yes! Gather 'round, my son, and I shall tell you a tale..."
Homer,"No, the bank put Lenny in charge."
Homer,"Oh, but Daddy doesn't feel so good."
Homer,"Here you go, honey. That's about all the recycling I can handle today."
Homer,"Hey, why don't you try the old folks home? They practically live in their own filth!"
Homer,"You're welcome, honey."
Homer,You mean Maggie?
Homer,Lisa! You have a guest!
Homer,"So, um, how's life in the gutter?"
Homer,"See that, boy? Why aren't you making any business deals?"
Homer,It's all right. I understand. But we really could have used that twelve thousand dollars.
Homer,"Please be Flanders, please be Flanders, please be Flanders..."
Homer,"Good one, Mom! / You're so bad, honey."
Homer,Two in a row!
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,"Oh, I hope you learned your lesson, Lisa. Never help anyone."
Homer,I made a bad mistake and Lenny sent me home to think about what I did. But I don't remember what it was so I'm watching TV.
Homer,"Oh, I'd love to go with you, honey, but I've got a lot of work to do around the bed."
Homer,"In that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. Lousy God."
Homer,DAMMIT!!
Homer,Who cares? This is the best part of the week!
Homer,"It should, but it doesn't. Now who's going with Daddy to the dump?"
Homer,Yeah. We're gonna get rid of the Christmas tree. It's starting to turn brown.
Homer,Wanna come with?
Homer,It's your life.
Homer,"C'mon, Christmas tree."
Homer,Okay. Who's up for some scrounging?
Homer,"Hey, here's a perfectly good basketball half!"
Homer,"Oh my God! Help me, Lisa!"
Homer,Wh... what's going on? Wh... wha... why am I on a Japanese box?
Homer,"Oh, my God, what is that?..."
Homer,Why would you volunteer at the church?
Homer,"Volunteering is for suckers! Do you know that so-called ""volunteers"" don't even get paid?"
Homer,"But Marge, I'm obsessed with it! Where did it come from? What is it a box of? How'd my face get on it?!"
Homer,"Akira, can you read this for me?"
Homer,"Hokkaido, eh?"
Homer,"I'd like the phone book for Hokkaido, Japan, please."
Homer,Thank you. May I please use your phone?
Homer,Y-y-y-yes.
Homer,Yes. This is Homer Simpson from America. Who may I say is speaking to me?
Homer,"Uh, hello? Why am I Mr. Sparkle?"
Homer,"Well, I am Mr. Sparkle!"
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Put it in! Put it in!
Homer,"That didn't explain anything. All I know is they stole my face and used it for their stupid ""logo"". There's no other explanation."
Homer,"Well, it was a good ride while it lasted. C'mon kids. Let's go home."
Homer,That was fast.
Homer,"Thanks for swinging by the house, Reverend."
Homer,Konichi-wa.
Homer,"No, run around in circles!"
Homer,Now that's religion.
Homer,Can I have this one?
Homer,Chair goes round... chair goes round.
Homer,Yes.
Homer,I don't know. I'm kind of dizzy. I should probably go home sick.
Homer,Wow. You've got pencils with your name on 'em. Just like a pencil company executive. I'd give anything for one of these.
Homer,I didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
Homer,"Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip. If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know."
Homer,"Oh, yeah, they're always trying to screw ya."
Homer,"Hiya, Stretch! What's the good word?"
Homer,"Okay, Grimy!"
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Oh. Oh, I'm sorry."
Homer,Check.
Homer,"So how's it going, Grimy?"
Homer,"I wish I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME / TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL! So what's new, Grimy?"
Homer,Oh. A five THIRTEEN. I'll handle it.
Homer,That got it.
Homer,"Acid, eh? Gee, that would have been stupid. Boy would my face have been red!"
Homer,He did.
Homer,He likes you.
Homer,"Hi, Grimy, old buddy."
Homer,Okay. Do I have to do anything?
Homer,"Oh, I can't believe it. I've got an enemy. Me! The most beloved man in Springfield."
Homer,"No, I won't accept that."
Homer,"Oh, what'll I do, Moe?"
Homer,Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
Homer,This dinner has to go absolutely perfect if Grimy and me are going to be friends. Lisa -- be perfect.
Homer,Marge -- perfect. Bart -- perfect. Other kid -- perfect.
Homer,"No, no. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner. I didn't think he'd come, so I called and said I had something really important to tell him and that I could only tell him about it here."
Homer,It's him! It's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him!...
Homer,Welcome-to-the-Simpson-residence-or-Casa-De-Simpson-as-I-call-it-heh-heh-heh-heh.
Homer,It is. It is. But first let me introduce you to my family. My perfect family.
Homer,"This is my wife, Marge..."
Homer,"... and our beautiful baby. My daughter, Lisa -- I.Q. 156."
Homer,"See. And my son, Bart -- he owns a factory downtown."
Homer,I 'unno. Don't ask me how the economy works.
Homer,Wow.
Homer,"Yeah, that's me all right. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. And this is when I was on tour with The Smashing Pumpkins. Oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space."
Homer,Sure. You've never been?
Homer,Would you like to see my Grammy Award?
Homer,What?
Homer,What are you saying?
Homer,The car won't start. And I don't feel very good today. I am at work.
Homer,"Wh-- th-- that's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road."
Homer,No he won't. He hates me.
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, that's his problem. He's a nut. It's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut!"
Homer,I'll do it. To professionalism!
Homer,"Good morning, fellow employee. You'll notice that I am now a model worker. We should continue this conversation later during the designated break period. Sincerely, Homer Simpson."
Homer,"Oh. Design your own power plant, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am."
Homer,"Lenny, tell Mr. Burns I've gone home to work on the contest."
Homer,"Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?"
Homer,"Well, basically I just copied the plant we have now..."
Homer,Then I added some fins to lower wind resistance. And this racing stripe here I feel is pretty sharp.
Homer,"Hey, you okay, Grimy?"
Homer,You wish.
Homer,"Change the channel, Marge."
Homer,Over there.
Homer,"Barney, where's my car?!!"
Homer,"Ah, grrrreetings!"
Homer,Dad? Is that really you?
Homer,Call me when you get a karaoke machine.
Homer,I'm hiding from th-th-th-th-the ghost.
Homer,"B-b-before the show, you said we were having a Special Ghost tonight!"
Homer,What's a Tim Conway?
Homer,"Marge, have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers?"
Homer,"Honey, I'm home!"
Homer,"It's not a plant, Marge, it's a tree, and I've nearly chewed through it. Now remember, my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight."
Homer,"Okay. Now, before my boss comes, there's something important you should know --"
Homer,"But, Marge...!"
Homer,"Well, I know one thing in this world that's still pure and good."
Homer,"No... Candy! Sweet, sweet candy."
Homer,I WANT CANDY!
Homer,I WANT CANDY!
Homer,I wish our special guest Tim Conway didn't have to leave so soon.
Homer,"Well, that's all the time we have. So this is the Simpson family saying: ""As you walk down the road of life..."""
Homer,"You've really done it this time, Bart! You're in for the punishment of a lifetime!"
Homer,"No, no! Your room is full of toys. You're going to the, uh, garage!"
Homer,Not very.
Homer,"Well, I'm sorry if you heard ""Disneyland"", but I distinctly said ""military school."""
Homer,"If, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?"
Homer,They sure are.
Homer,That's not so disciplined.
Homer,I guess.
Homer,Leggo my leg.
Homer,"Son, for the last time, you're staying at military school."
Homer,Marge? You got that? Marge?!
Homer,"Hey, go on, boy. Go get it! Answer the phone! Be a good boy!"
Homer,"Oh, there's gotta be something on this thing for that thing."
Homer,"Well, Bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?"
Homer,"Uh, yeah. I've always said the boy could use more confidence."
Homer,"Well, kids, we're so proud of the way you completed military school, we thought this time we'd take you to Disneyland for real!"
Homer,"'Evening, Moe."
Homer,You got the black one.
Homer,"Hey everybody, I'm Peter Pantsless!"
Homer,"Shut up! It's my car, and I say we're going to the lost city of gold!"
Homer,"Goodnight, Barney. Don't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow. Just slide it under the door."
Homer,"So you lost my car, eh? Well, that's just grand. I ought to punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school."
Homer,"Marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts."
Homer,Throw it away! Nothing good has ever come out of New York City!
Homer,My vehicle!
Homer,"Oh, I don't want to go to New York City."
Homer,"New York is a hellhole, and you know how I feel about hellholes."
Homer,It's time I told you about a chapter of my life I hoped would be closed forever. I was on my way to the Harrisburg Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat. But it required a stopover in New York City.
Homer,All I had to do was walk a few blocks from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to my train at Penn Station...
Homer,"Anyhow, I must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing I knew, I was running for my life."
Homer,And that's when the CHUDs came at me.
Homer,"Lousy Bart... his money... All right, New York, I'm coming back. But you're not getting this!"
Homer,Don't you start.
Homer,"Marge, I can't feel my legs!"
Homer,I can't feel my legs!
Homer,Oh. Hi.
Homer,"Now remember, criminals prey on small-town folk like us. So if anyone asks, we're sophisticated millionaires from the Ozarks."
Homer,Good. I don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death-maze. You wait here at the bus station while I get the car.
Homer,"Oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy."
Homer,I'm on to you!
Homer,Your vehicle is illegally parked at One World Trade Plaza. Hmmm...
Homer,Ooohh...
Homer,Stupid city! What the hell is this thing?
Homer,"Come off! Come off! Oh, all right, you!"
Homer,Ow.
Homer,"They expect me to sit here from nine to five?! That's how many hours? Ten, eleven, denominator... Oh, where's Lisa when you need her?"
Homer,Come on! Pick up the pace!
Homer,"Hey! I'm not a bum... Thanks, but I don't need... Okay, if you insist, but... Spare change, lady? Lousy cheapskate..."
Homer,So hungry... can't leave car... Huh...
Homer,Getting closer... closer...almost there... Ow!
Homer,"Hey, uh, could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza?"
Homer,"Aw, shoot. All right, all right. Give me one bowl."
Homer,Geez! That's just... awful!
Homer,"Mmmm. Now, what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth?"
Homer,Blech! Eww! Geesh! I'll take a crab juice.
Homer,Uh-oh. Uhh... You got a men's room in there?
Homer,"But I can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. Oh, why did I drink all that crab juice?"
Homer,Mmmmm.
Homer,"Come on, boot guy!"
Homer,Flushing Meadows...
Homer,"Oh, I can't take it anymore. All right, I'll only be gone for a second."
Homer,Frontsies... Backsies... I'm with them... V.I.P... Coming through... Very important person... They gave me frontsies...
Homer,"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH. Oh, yes. Oh."
Homer,"What? ""Failure to wait by vehicle: $250."""
Homer,"Oh no, it's getting dark. Well, that's it. I'm getting out of this town alive if it kills me!"
Homer,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Homer,It's gonna be dark soon. I'll never make it out of here with this rotten boot on my car.
Homer,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Homer,"Aha! I've got it! Brain, how can I ever thank you?"
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"Just a minute... Everything's under control... Yes, I'd be upset, too..."
Homer,Hey! Hey! Hey!
Homer,The boss says you're fired.
Homer,"So long, Mr. Boot."
Homer,Come o-o-on! Come o-o-on!
Homer,Die! Die!
Homer,"Homer one, New York nothing."
Homer,Thanks for your patience!
Homer,Ow!
Homer,"We're getting outta here, now! Jump in, Marge! Trust me! Throw the kids! No time for the baby!"
Homer,Come on! Let's go! Everyone into the car! Now!
Homer,"We'll see, honey."
Homer,We'll see.
Homer,"Ooh, a fresh batch of America Balls! Mmm..."
Homer,"Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son."
Homer,"Or ""crapweeds""."
Homer,"Not if they were called ""scumdrops""."
Homer,Fair enough.
Homer,"Okay, once more. Where are we going?"
Homer,And why are you and the old lady in the car?
Homer,And why is Marge here?
Homer,And why am I here?
Homer,And why are the kids here?
Homer,And why is Grampa here?
Homer,"Can I see your copy of ""Swank"", Armin?"
Homer,"Hey, everybody, look! Armin Tamzarian's back and he's gonna take over the school again!"
Homer,"All right, all right. So, he's a fraud. I don't care! His mom doesn't care! Do any of you care?"
Homer,"Now, if you'll allow me, I think I have a solution that'll satisfy the town and let Sgt. Skinner keep his dignity."
Homer,And we salute you for it. Now don't come back.
Homer,Oh no we don't! Judge Snyder?
Homer,BOY THE WAY THE BEE GEES PLAYED...
Homer,GUESSING HOW MUCH ELVIS WEIGHED...
Homer,WATCHING SHOWS LIKE GENTLE BEN...
Homer,"MISTER, WE COULD USE A MAN LIKE SHERIFF LOBO AGAIN."
Homer,DISCO DUCK AND FLEETWOOD MAC...
Homer,"Hey there, Meathead. What are you watchin'?"
Homer,What a bad father.
Homer,"Lisa, knock off that racket!"
Homer,I'll practice you!
Homer,"Bart, make her stop."
Homer,"Aw, Lisa, it doesn't look so bad."
Homer,"Lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better I'll destroy something Bart loves."
Homer,"Don't worry, son. If that bothers you, I'll destroy something Maggie loves."
Homer,You don't remember how you got it?
Homer,"Oh, well, it all happened in 1990. Back then, the artist formerly known as Prince was currently known as Prince. Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. And Bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school..."
Homer,"Now, son, on your first day of school, I'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me..."
Homer,Lousy traumatic childhood.
Homer,BART WAS FEELING MIGHTY BLUE...
Homer,"And that, my children, is the story of Bart's first day of school."
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,No problem. I'll just give her a sip of beer. Come on Maggie -- it's Miller time! Yes-it's-Mil-ler-time!
Homer,"Oh, my father gave me beer as a child. Till I wrapped my little red wagon around a tree."
Homer,And we never did.
Homer,Brilliant! I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
Homer,"Oh, it's beautiful! Oh! Oh, let's put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!"
Homer,"Oh, all right. What a- Burn it! Send it to Hell!"
Homer,Get it away!
Homer,"Bart, son. You wanna play catch?"
Homer,"When a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is seriously wrong."
Homer,Get the hell out.
Homer,Wait a minute... she's right!
Homer,"Marge, he's five. His life is over. Lisa's the wave of the future."
Homer,Wow. Just think of the possibilities.
Homer,Nah.
Homer,Hm.
Homer,"Well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her."
Homer,I'll give ya fifty bucks.
Homer,Seventy-five.
Homer,"Excellente! Muchas gracias, Señorata!"
Homer,Ah so.
Homer,"Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. Bart was miserable at school, and Lisa's gifts were going to waste."
Homer,You do that.
Homer,"Dad, what are you doin' here?"
Homer,Ohhh. So hottt.
Homer,"Uh-uh. Forget it Marge. There is no way I am spending my Saturdays at a Museum. Unless... Museums don't have foosball, do they?"
Homer,"You lose, Michelangelo's David. Who's next?"
Homer,Unless what?
Homer,"Oh, Marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! And our stopgap solution is getting cranky."
Homer,"Marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning."
Homer,No need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
Homer,"Up up up up up up up. If ""ifs"" and ""buts"" were candy and nuts y... how does the rest of that go?"
Homer,"All right, all right, I promise. There must be another way to get an air conditioner..."
Homer,Mmmm... re-circulated air.
Homer,"What, Flanders."
Homer,"Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders, but haven't you heard of ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"""
Homer,"Well, Moe, this is it. Today's the day I get my new air conditioner."
Homer,She has a gift.
Homer,Oooh.
Homer,Wowww...
Homer,A musical instrument? Could that be a way to encourage a gifted child? Just give me a sign!
Homer,"Eh, works for me."
Homer,"So what do you like, Lisa? Viomalin... tubamaba... obomoboe?"
Homer,Ohh! Saxomophone.
Homer,Two hundred dollars!
Homer,"Oh, I'll take it."
Homer,"Yeah. ""To Lisa. Never forget your Daddy loves ."""
Homer,...and that inscription is still there today.
Homer,"Next, I'll tell you the origin of Maggie's pacifier."
Homer,"Ohhhh, but Marge! Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig?"
Homer,Will you get off my front lawn?
Homer,"Why -- oh, I give up."
Homer,I learned from the master.
Homer,Lisa! Enough saxomophone already!
Homer,Stupid hippo.
Homer,Stupid frog.
Homer,"Relax, I built a bomb shelter."
Homer,"Fine, then don't use it."
Homer,Good.
Homer,So do I.
Homer,You should be.
Homer,"Blankets, radio... Oh, a Gary Larson calendar. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I--don't get it."
Homer,You call that prime rib?
Homer,"It's green, moron. Earth to stupid guy, hullo? Maybe a little friendly punching will move your ass."
Homer,"Heh, still got it..."
Homer,"Geez, what's with all the death?"
Homer,Oh my God. Everyone's gone! Little Bart...
Homer,Little Lisa-a-a...
Homer,Little Marge...
Homer,And the rest.
Homer,"Oh, I've lost everything. I can't go on. No, no, no! I can't just wallow in sadness. It's time to laugh again. I'm the last man alive!"
Homer,And I can do everything I've always wanted!
Homer,"Oh Spade, why did you put Farley in charge of the bees? Hey buddy, down in front."
Homer,War! Hunh! Good God y'all! / What is it good for? / Absolutely nothin'! Say it again! Okay!
Homer,"Hey, what happened to the tunes?"
Homer,"Hey, what the hell's goin' on? Where'd you get those cloaks?"
Homer,You're mutants?
Homer,You want me? Come and get me!!
Homer,A c... a coffin!
Homer,"Die, you chalk-faced goons!"
Homer,"Go to hell, cloaky!"
Homer,Safe at last.
Homer,That better not be the mutants.
Homer,Marge! Kids! You're alive!
Homer,"Ohh, com'ere."
Homer,Now that's the Marge I married.
Homer,"So, who wants to steal some Ferraris?"
Homer,"Okay, now let's not jump to conclusions, everyone."
Homer,He's crazy.
Homer,"Hmmm, two bucks... And it only transports matter? Umm... Well, ah... I'll give you 35 cents."
Homer,I said I'll take it.
Homer,"This mountain of stairs used to make bedtime a grueling chore. But not any more, baby!"
Homer,"Good night, losers!"
Homer,"Man, how'd I live without this thing?"
Homer,"Oh, man that's good."
Homer,"Sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated doowhackey. If you don't use it responsibly... Kablamo!"
Homer,It was your mother.
Homer,"Bart, are you in there? Have you forgotten our little ""kablamo"" talk?"
Homer,I think she's right. The pants are a dead giveaway.
Homer,"So then Lenny says, ""As if! Don't even go there, sister."""
Homer,"Yeah, well Lenny said it."
Homer,"Eh, it'll turn up somewhere."
Homer,"Okay, okay. It's your sugar, Bart."
Homer,"Get 'im, boy! Smash that fly! Mush him up good!"
Homer,"Nice work, son."
Homer,"Nobody likes a tattletale, honey."
Homer,"Well, we were lucky this time. But it's all too clear that some things in this universe aren't meant to be trifled with."
Homer,Something I should have done a long time ago.
Homer,I'll teach you to mess with my machine!
Homer,I'm gonna chop you good!
Homer,That cost me 35 cents!
Homer,You're just making it worse. I promise I won't hurt you.
Homer,"That sounds like witch talk to me, Lisa."
Homer,Woo hoo! I accuse Goody Flanders.
Homer,They're in my hair! They're in my hair!
Homer,"C'mon, give us some candy. Don't pretend you're not home!"
Homer,She's a witch!
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,"Oh, I've never heard of those people."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Yes, yes, oh God yes!"
Homer,"Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win."
Homer,Bo-ring!
Homer,"Oh, but I want to do some rioting."
Homer,All done.
Homer,"I'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please."
Homer,"Relax, Marge. If someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know."
Homer,"Watch the fish, Marge."
Homer,"What did I tell you, Marge?"
Homer,"Oh, let's get that."
Homer,Let's get that! The suffocation thing!
Homer,Five hundred dollars! Forget it.
Homer,"I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are."
Homer,"I couldn't agree more, Marjorie. You deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have."
Homer,"I don't have to be careful, I got a gun."
Homer,"Oh, yeah."
Homer,Baby.
Homer,Mmm-hmm.
Homer,Ahh.
Homer,"Ooo, I like the sound of that."
Homer,"Oh, I don't need anything like that - yet. Just gimme my gun."
Homer,Five days! But I'm mad now!
Homer,I'd kill you if I had my gun.
Homer,Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns.
Homer,"Well, if he didn't have any guns, I'd show him a thing or two."
Homer,Let's see what happens when he walks into my store. Then we'll see who's worried about five day waiting period...
Homer,Marge kicked me out.
Homer,"Pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. I tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children."
Homer,How am I supposed to last five days without shooting something?
Homer,"Come on, come on, open up!"
Homer,"Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me."
Homer,Yuh.
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Former President.
Homer,Potentially dangerous?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Close your eyes Marge, I've got a surprise for you."
Homer,Okay. Open your eyes!
Homer,"Hey, it's a handgun! Isn't it great? This is the trigger... and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die..."
Homer,I thought Smithers did it.
Homer,Only if you clean your room.
Homer,TV said that? But I have to have a gun. It's in the Constitution.
Homer,"You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't have this gun, the King of England could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. Do you want that? Huh? Do you?"
Homer,"All right, then."
Homer,"A gun is not a weapon, Marge. It's a tool. Like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. You just need more education on the subject. Tell you what: you come with me to an NRA meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more."
Homer,Pull!
Homer,"Learnin' somethin', Marge?"
Homer,"Hi, I'm Homer S."
Homer,"Hi. It seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. So if you'll have me, I would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization!"
Homer,"Oh, come on, be fair Marge. For once in your life, be fair."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"What? Oh Apu, I would never..."
Homer,Or would I?
Homer,I'll do it! I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart.
Homer,"All right, put your... Oh well, I'll rob it next time."
Homer,"Sure thing, honey."
Homer,You want me to get the cat down?
Homer,"See you in hell, dinner plate."
Homer,"Mmm, you probably left them at work. On another topic, guess who was picked to host the next NRA get-together?"
Homer,You said the breakfast table.
Homer,"Listen, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll put the safety on."
Homer,"Oops, guess it already was on."
Homer,Uh. I'd better just put it down.
Homer,"All right, Marge. I'll do it. For you."
Homer,And I'm a wonderful man.
Homer,"Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun."
Homer,"I put it in a safe place, Marge. I mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?"
Homer,"But Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you'd find out!"
Homer,So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go! I'll be just fine!
Homer,Do you know how to cook dinner?
Homer,"Ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!"
Homer,They're here! They're here!
Homer,"Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies."
Homer,Anyone else want a beer?
Homer,I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.
Homer,"Yeah, but..."
Homer,I didn't get one yet.
Homer,"This gun cost me everything. My wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun."
Homer,This stinks. I want my family back.
Homer,"Marge? Sorry. Marge? Oh, sorry. Marge?"
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"Oh, Marge, there's so many things I want to yell to you!"
Homer,O-kay!
Homer,"Oh-ho, confused, would we?"
Homer,"Oh, honey, please come home. I need you. It's dark in the house and I'm hungry and lonesome. And there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks."
Homer,"It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection if you've got no one to protect?"
Homer,"Freeze, bad guy!"
Homer,"I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was..."
Homer,"The joke's on you, buddy. There's no bullets in that thing."
Homer,"Okay, don't shoot!"
Homer,"I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge. But this gun had a hold on me. I felt this incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun. So please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!"
Homer,Now wait a second. You doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!
Homer,You're a disgrace to this family.
Homer,"There you go, Bart, Pee Wee Football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches."
Homer,Then it's settled.
Homer,"Hey, Flanders. You're the worst coach this team has ever had."
Homer,"Yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot."
Homer,"Fun, too."
Homer,"Ahh, you got lucky, Flanders! And fix that hat!"
Homer,"Huh, big deal. I've been carried out of Moe's like that hundreds of times."
Homer,"Well, I'm tellin' ya, Flanders can't coach at all! Now I'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason..."
Homer,"Yes, Roy."
Homer,"Yes. Mr. Koufax, don't you think Flanders is a big jerk? Y'ello? Y'ello?"
Homer,"Yeah, Homer again. I think we got cut off. Y'ello?"
Homer,Flaaaan-ders... Flaaaan-ders...
Homer,Flaaaan-ders...
Homer,Game's out there! Made you look...
Homer,"I know, Sweetie, and I got him right in the... uh-oh."
Homer,"Hii-hi-hi-hi, hi, Flanders. Go Wildcats!"
Homer,"No, no. No, no, no. It's just that, well, like I was yelling earlier, it seems like anyone with half a brain could coach better than you."
Homer,Me? But you were doing such a great job.
Homer,You're not gonna make the team with that kinda attitude.
Homer,Then why are you running the obstacle course?
Homer,You never use it.
Homer,Wipe that smile off your face.
Homer,"I'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. From now on, I'm gonna work you like a dog. Now go fetch me twenty laps."
Homer,Do it.
Homer,"Well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, I'd like to hear it."
Homer,"I knew it. Slowing down already, huh?"
Homer,My father never believed in me.
Homer,"Well, I'm not gonna make the same mistake. From now on I'm gonna be kinder to my son, and meaner to my Dad."
Homer,"Quit runnin', son. I just want to give ya a big hug!"
Homer,I believe in you! Hug meeeee!
Homer,Will you hug meeeee? Hug meee!
Homer,"Good practice, team. Okay, it's time for the easiest part of any coach's job, the cuts."
Homer,"Now while I wasn't able to cut everyone I wanted to, I have cut a lot of you. Wendell is cut. Rudy is cut. Janey, you're gone. Steven, I like your hustle. That's why it was so hard to cut you."
Homer,"Congratulations, the rest of you made the team."
Homer,"Except you, you and you."
Homer,"Now just because I'm his father, he'll get no special treatment. He calls me ""Coach"" just like everyone else. Which he'll be doing... as our new starting quarterback!"
Homer,"What is it, sweetie?"
Homer,"Not any more. From now on, you're my main man. Okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. Oh, Rod, you don't have to. You're cut."
Homer,"Son, you can do anything you want. I have total faith in you."
Homer,Since your mother yelled at me. Now how 'bout that hug?
Homer,"Not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, Flanders?"
Homer,"It's okay, son. You'll do better next time."
Homer,Look at him go!
Homer,"Exx-cellent poise, son. You panicked, but you didn't lose your cool."
Homer,"Great debut, son. You really settled in after some early jitters."
Homer,"Oh, really? Do reeky players get the game ball?"
Homer,"Hey, everybody! Let's hear it for Bart!"
Homer,"Ah, you guys are some k..."
Homer,"Ohh, your Mother's not pregnant, is she?"
Homer,"Ohh, boy. Well, I'll just have to go to my back up plan... Nelson, how's your arm feelin'?"
Homer,"Good, take this note over to the referee."
Homer,"Come on, guys. We can't play without Bart. He's the heart of this team!"
Homer,"Don't listen to them, son. I have total faith in you."
Homer,"What? Well, I got news for you, Mister. You can't quit! You're cut! You too, Milhouse."
Homer,"Oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too."
Homer,"I didn't raise him to be a quitter, Marge. It must have been you. You've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler..."
Homer,"Well, if quitting is the best, maybe I should just quit my job."
Homer,"Mr. Burns, this is Homer J. Simpson, the father of the big quitter. Well, I just wanted to tell you I'm a big quitter, too, and I quit!"
Homer,So...
Homer,"We're in the championship. Way to go, team!"
Homer,"Well, Bart, looks like it's just you and... Ohhh."
Homer,"I'm feelin' kinda low, Apu. You got any of that beer that has candy floatin' in it? You know, ""Skittlebrau""?"
Homer,"Oh. Well, then, just give me a six-pack and a couple bags of Skittles."
Homer,"Hello, son."
Homer,"I wanna apologize. I just got so caught up trying to encourage you, I was blinded to your stinky performance. If you forgive me, I promise I'll never encourage you again."
Homer,I've got lots of quarters.
Homer,"Aww... You know, tomorrow's the championship game and I could sure use a good offensive tackle."
Homer,Consider him cut.
Homer,"Hold on, I'm workin' it out."
Homer,"Okay. Half of you vibrate that way, two of you fall down, Nelson, you just spin around in a circle."
Homer,"Oh no, my quarterback. What are we gonna do?"
Homer,"Are you sure, son?"
Homer,I knew I could count on you.
Homer,"Scully, you're cut. Ehhh, Brooks, Groening, Simon, you're all cut. Castellaneta, gone. Kavner, cut. Cartwright, cut. Smith, sorry, cut. Azaria and Shearer, you're cut. Firestone, you're cut. So is Judge. Namath, you stay. All of those people are cut. Phil, Schultz and Wolf and Silverman. Goldreyer, O'Brien, Dolye, Selman. I don't know what... I don't know what you're doin' here, 'cause you're all cut. Pietila, Clan..., Kuwahaha... There're so many cuts here look, I'll just post 'em up and you just see where your name is. Oooo, look at how many cuts there are there. Ohhh, boy, you're cut. All of you. He's cut, I cut you! You're cut too, Shooshie!"
Homer,"Yeah, why don't we buy 'em mink stoles while we're at it?"
Homer,I understand. Yoink. Wow...
Homer,Whoa...
Homer,"Ooo, let's see what she wrote!"
Homer,"Oh, you hate lotus flowers, too? Oh, don't get me started on Lotus flowers."
Homer,"Oh. Well, congratulations."
Homer,Not... really...
Homer,"O-kay, here we go..."
Homer,Tell her the truth. You're not ready to get married.
Homer,Then just tell her you're already married.
Homer,Then get married. What the hell do you want from me?!
Homer,Loser. Loser. Loser. Five... hundred.... dollars! Apu wake up! I want to buy a Yodel and this lottery ticket.
Homer,I have this much.
Homer,Oh... Oh... Ooo... Oh... Yodel.
Homer,"Late night, huh?"
Homer,You dog.
Homer,What's the big problem?
Homer,Then maybe you shouldn't of told her you did.
Homer,"Okay... seems to me , what you oughta do is, um..."
Homer,"Wellll, you could always move into my house, and tell your mom that Marge is your wife."
Homer,It's you.
Homer,"Oh, that Yodel was so good. I wish I was eatin' it right now."
Homer,"Oh, crap, I forgot!"
Homer,"Marge, I need a small favor. For the next few days, will you pretend to be Apu's wife?"
Homer,Please? It's just for as long as his mother's living here.
Homer,Can you feel the love?
Homer,"Okay, gotta run. Apu, I'm sure you wanna to get upstairs and fix that broken toilet before Marge yells at you again."
Homer,But you can't leave! We're scammin' an old lady at my house and I need a place to hide out.
Homer,"Oh, right. With the giant heads."
Homer,"Hey, Dad. I've come to spend some time with my favorite father."
Homer,You're already in a home.
Homer,"Oh, no, I'm not... Oh, well, let's see whatcha got here."
Homer,"Supper at 4 o'clock? Oh-ho, what a sweet deal!"
Homer,"Hey! They got chairs with wheels, and here I am using my legs like a sucker!"
Homer,"Jasper. Gladys. Beatrice. Lookin' good, Hattie. Asa. Hazel. Hazel! Hazel!"
Homer,"Oh, the hell with her. Hester. Emil. Prudence. Lemuel. Increase. Dad."
Homer,"Oh, no you don't."
Homer,Eat my dust!
Homer,Damn right.
Homer,Mmm. Who knew that Lay's made liquid potato chips? I can't suck just one.
Homer,"Please. Also, I think I'm getting a bedsore. What do you have to do to get turned around here?"
Homer,"Hey, what's Lucky hooked up to?"
Homer,And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker! And how come everyone gets a bedpan and I have to walk all the way over there?
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,"When I get old, Marge, I want you to promise you'll put me in a home. It's like being a baby, only you're old enough to appreciate it."
Homer,"Ohhh, right, right. The fake marriage thing. How's that goin'?"
Homer,Lied to his mother.
Homer,"You know what you could do, Apu..."
Homer,You could fake your own death...
Homer,All you need is a car bomb and...
Homer,"Moe, what do you recommend for severe depression?"
Homer,"Actually, it's more like twelve. No, I'm so stupid, seven. It's seven hours. You have seven hours. See? Seven."
Homer,C'mon. You shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.
Homer,You should be livin' like there's no tomorrow. And I know just the place.
Homer,"Ahh. Is this the life, or what?"
Homer,"Nah, just your screwy country."
Homer,"Don't worry, Apu. Some day you'll meet someone you really love."
Homer,"Gods, eh?"
Homer,Screw him.
Homer,Put me down! Ganesh commands you! Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Homer,"Come on, elephant. Put me down! Hey, everyone seems upside down."
Homer,"""Up, up and away, in my beautiful, my beautiful motor boattt..."" Da-da-da-da-da."
Homer,That doesn't matter. The important thing is we won.
Homer,Sheesh! You're the most paranoid family I've ever been affiliated with.
Homer,"I'd like a yellow boat, please. With extra motors."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Howdy, gents! I'm here to collect my free--"
Homer,OW! OW! My boating arm! What's going on?
Homer,"Lousy cops. Lucky for you I'm double-parked or I'd... There. Now, can I please have my motorboat?"
Homer,I didn't like it. The mast had termites.
Homer,Because... the thingee was... shut up.
Homer,Fossils shmossils. You can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. Bones shmones.
Homer,Lemme through! I got here late!
Homer,Now that's interesting.
Homer,"So long, suckers!"
Homer,"Come on... Come on, Angel."
Homer,I'm locking it up in my safe deposit closet with my other valuables.
Homer,I'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.
Homer,"Pfft. That's what they said about this Billy Beer, smartypants."
Homer,Ahh. We elected the wrong Carter.
Homer,Sounds like goood watchin'.
Homer,"Get your own angel, ya moocher."
Homer,"Hey, I'm trying to eat here. Beat it, Pegleg!"
Homer,"A buck, eh? That gives me an idea..."
Homer,"Fifty cents, please."
Homer,HEEERE'S THE ANGEL! / SEEEE THE ANGEL / IT'S MY ANGEL / NO ONE ELSE'S / NEXT TO-OO TH-E RAKES!
Homer,"No one's calling it an angel, Lisa. If you'll look carefully, you'll notice I never once used the word ""angel""."
Homer,That's a typo.
Homer,"Oh, no. Oh, no. We could lose out on bags and bags of money. It's sacrilegious, I tell ya."
Homer,Pfft! Facts are meaningless. You can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. Facts shmacts.
Homer,"Okay, folks. Get your angel glow sticks! No one gets into heaven without a glow stick!"
Homer,Somebody stop her!
Homer,"Oh-ho, no! This can't be happening! What the hell are we gonna do with ten thousand angel ashtrayyys?"
Homer,You damn well better!
Homer,"Okay, okay, don't panic. Marge, stop panicking. We need a replacement skeleton, and we need it now. Bart! Strip down to your skeleton!"
Homer,Look! A message!
Homer,"""The end will come at sundown."" Heh heh heh heh. Hey, wait a second. I don't like the sound of that."
Homer,"Oh angel, listen not to this child of Satan."
Homer,"Oh, Marge, don't let go, no matter what. If they want you in heaven, they gotta take me, too."
Homer,"Ahh, I love these lazy Saturdays."
Homer,Work!
Homer,"Ahh, I love these real Saturdays. They're so relaxing. Not like that fake Saturday that almost got me fired."
Homer,Absolutely.
Homer,It is?
Homer,We do?
Homer,"Oh, that."
Homer,Ah.
Homer,Pfft. Friends of the library?
Homer,I went yesterday.
Homer,Lenny really wanted to go.
Homer,Open a window.
Homer,"Allll right, I hear ya, honey. Change into something nice. We're steppin' out!"
Homer,Can you believe it? It's already been a year.
Homer,"Wow, sweetheart. Look at all this seized booty. We could find the drug boat of our dreams!"
Homer,"Well, I bet there's drug dresses and drug vacuum cleaners, too!"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,I don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat.
Homer,Then what are you complaining about? You got yours. Mm-hm-hm.
Homer,"Oh, yeah. You've gotta be careful when you do a trick like this...."
Homer,You're the boss.
Homer,Okay-bye-love-you.
Homer,"Oh, yeah. I'm a real expert."
Homer,You betcha.
Homer,Nothin' but.
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,I see.
Homer,"I don't know, Marge. Trying is the first step toward failure."
Homer,You're all nuts.
Homer,What about me? You didn't thank me.
Homer,I like being thanked.
Homer,Seat belts?! Pfft! They kill more people than they save.
Homer,"Gee, that picture makes your butt look big."
Homer,Lumber. We need lumber.
Homer,"Hey, Skinner! Wanna drag race?"
Homer,Come on! It'll be fun!
Homer,Come on... you... stupid... car... you... get... goin'...
Homer,Lousy doormat.
Homer,"Yeah, honey. Even if you don't succeed in the business world, you're still the world's greatest wife and mother."
Homer,"Kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. Why don't we let her clear the table in peace?"
Homer,"Man, the air feels good on my neck!"
Homer,"Ooo, gumball."
Homer,"Wow, honey, you sold a house and got rid of the Flanders. What's for dinner?"
Homer,"Yeah, me too. Let me know if you need any help."
Homer,It was just an expression.
Homer,That old Flanders place gives me the creeps.
Homer,"""MY NAME IS LUKA, / I LIVE ON THE SECOND FLOOR..."""
Homer,"This is my car! And I'm not fat, it's glandular!"
Homer,Stop it!
Homer,You're...
Homer,...going...
Homer,...down...
Homer,...punk!
Homer,"Yeah, you're right."
Homer,"Oh. Oh, wow, lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap."
Homer,"Oh, you will, honey. You will."
Homer,Stupid heater! Don't make me come in there!
Homer,"You know me, Marge. I crave the hustle and bustle."
Homer,"Oh, Santa's got a little trick up his sleeve."
Homer,"Attention, shoppers. Register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience."
Homer,"Sorry, these are for display only... This has been recalled... Oo, Bart would like this... We're out of these..."
Homer,Register 9 is now closed.
Homer,"C'mon, kids. Let's try the lights!"
Homer,Knock it off...
Homer,"What the-- Where's Christmas? Lisa, where's Christmas?"
Homer,Can - we - skip - church?
Homer,"Well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: God hates us."
Homer,"Okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy."
Homer,"Oh yeah? We'll show 'em. Come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis."
Homer,That's not as fun as it looks.
Homer,"Lisa, you promised they'd be miserable. What the hell's goin' on?!"
Homer,"Yeah, you're right, Moe. You're always Moe."
Homer,"You take that back, Barney!"
Homer,"Stay out of this, old man."
Homer,"Aw, that's my girl. I love you, Marjorie."
Homer,You shut up.
Homer,"Oh, Marge, I don't wanna hear any more about that silver polish."
Homer,"Wow, this really restores your faith in..."
Homer,"Lisa, do you have to practice that stupid song now?!"
Homer,"Thanks, Ted."
Homer,"Marge, kids, let's go buy some happiness!"
Homer,"Is this car $15,000?"
Homer,What a deal! I'd be a sucker not to get it.
Homer,"Outta my way, snow-poke!"
Homer,"Don't worry, honey. I know exactly what I'm --"
Homer,Oopsie.
Homer,Shut up! One at a time! Lisa?
Homer,I knew this would happen.
Homer,"Lisa, no! Your hands are too weak!"
Homer,"I'm gonna kill you! / No, I'm killing him first! / Why you little... Bart, the next time you ever have... / You went too far..."
Homer,"Yes, Kent. ""Hello, jerk. We may never find you, and we should probably all stop looking. But one thing's for sure: you do exist."""
Homer,"Oh, it's true! We weren't robbed! That part we made up! But the rest is true!"
Homer,"Well, the boy told us. But that was after we filed a phony police report."
Homer,"Relax, Marge. This'll all blow over."
Homer,"Oh, no. Look at the line!"
Homer,Head of the line! A family could get used to being shunned. Huh? Huh?
Homer,"Run for your lives, everyone! This is not a drill!"
Homer,"Oh great, now we have to send him a card."
Homer,There's only one way out. We've gotta give this greedy town its money back.
Homer,"Oh no, there's that angry mob again."
Homer,What the hell's goin' on?
Homer,Maybe so. But there's one thing they forgot to take away from us. This washcloth.
Homer,The hell it is!
Homer,"Gimme that! / Uh, gimme that! / No! / Let go! / Gimme that my washcloth! / I want it!"
Homer,"Hey, she's getting away with the washcloth!"
Homer,Go!
Homer,"Oh, I got it! Oh, it's just a thread! It was... She's got... she's got the washcloth!"
Homer,"Well, they put us on the ""Waiting to Exhale Waiting List."" But they said don't hold your breath."
Homer,"Whoa. Whoa. Calm down, little lady--Take it easy--Take it easy. No."
Homer,"Something very close, exactly along those lines--A Clint Eastwood - Lee Marvin shoot 'em up western!"
Homer,"With blood, I bet!"
Homer,"They're singing! They're singing, Marge! Why aren't they killing each other?"
Homer,"Wait, wait, wait. Here comes Lee Marvin. Thank God. He's always drunk and violent."
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"Ooh, why did they have to screw up a perfectly serviceable wagon story with all that fruity singing?"
Homer,Singing is the lowest form of communication.
Homer,"No I don't, I hate to rhyme."
Homer,"NO I DON'T, I THINK THEY'RE BAD / THEY'RE FAKE AND PHONEY AND TOTALLY WRONG."
Homer,I WOULDN'T / I COULDN'T / I HATE THAT STUFF!
Homer,AND THEIR DAMP-TROUSERED PA.
Homer,"SEE? ALL THIS SINGING SCARED HIM AWAY / IF WE JUST TALKED LIKE NORMAL, HE'D PROBABLY STAY."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,I knew I should've shut that window.
Homer,EVEN THE CRIMINALS ARE BEGINNING TO CROON.
Homer,"ALL RIGHT MARGE, YOU'VE CONVINCED ME, THERE ARE MORE TERRIBLE THINGS / THAN MUSICAL COMEDIES WHERE EVERYONE SINGS."
Homer,And not a moment too soon.
Homer,"The experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you should do it yourself first to show him how."
Homer,"Sor-reee, your majesty."
Homer,Ice-cream-man-Ice cream-man!
Homer,It's carnival time!
Homer,"Here's money, kids! Take what you need!"
Homer,Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!
Homer,Oo! Oo! I want to see Lobster Boy and Shrimp Girl!
Homer,Oo! Oo! Me first!
Homer,Heart condition? Get outta here.
Homer,"Obviously, I don't. Now if you'll get out of my way..."
Homer,"He's not just some ""guy,"" Marge. He's a carny, and part of a noble tradition. Carnies built this country. The carnival part of it, anyway. And though they may be rat-like in appearance, they are truly kings among men."
Homer,"Yes, sir!"
Homer,"Ow, my heart!"
Homer,Do do do do do...
Homer,"Who, me?"
Homer,"Sorry, son. Daddy failed."
Homer,A novelty comb! Kings among men...
Homer,"Hey, come on! He doesn't have any money. Look at his clothes."
Homer,"Hey, that's not fair! I wanna be a carny, too! Can I, mister? Huh? Can I? Please?"
Homer,"Sure, anything you want."
Homer,"Oh-ho, put down your stick. We're here to work."
Homer,Hmm...
Homer,"Yeah, he's telling the truth."
Homer,"Thanks for the food, Mister..."
Homer,"Did ya hear that, Bart? The Carny Code. Bart, did you hear that?"
Homer,"Yes, sir!"
Homer,Fry up some cheese?
Homer,"Please, folks. Hold your fire. The water level is dangerously low. Oh!"
Homer,Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ow! My leg!
Homer,Oh. Bart?
Homer,Do I like chicken?
Homer,I guess not.
Homer,"Buddy, you're the luckiest chicken in the world."
Homer,"Oh, we'll see about that. Gimme ten rings."
Homer,"Ah, yes. How do we handle refunds?"
Homer,Gimme ten rings.
Homer,"Hey, there's a sucker."
Homer,"Yeah, we could start our own game, where people throw ducks at balloons, and nothing's the way it seems."
Homer,And how...
Homer,I understand.
Homer,"Not right now, son. Daddy's talking to a policeman."
Homer,No. He's Bart.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,It's a ring toss game.
Homer,"Well, ain't that somethin'."
Homer,"I was trying to, but the opportunity never came up."
Homer,Can't you stay in the Whack-A-Mole game?
Homer,"Look at 'em, Bart. If a carny can wind up homeless, it can happen to anyone."
Homer,"Yes, but first there's a little matter of the Carny Code."
Homer,"Cooder, Spud. Get off that hog. You're coming to stay at our house."
Homer,"Oh, it won't be long. Once their resume gets out, they'll have all kinds of offers. The older one can pull out his left eye."
Homer,"Now who's the filthy sleezebag, uh Marge?"
Homer,That's weird. The key doesn't fit.
Homer,Cooder! What have you done to our house?
Homer,You can't do this to me. What about the Carny Code?
Homer,Carnies took over our house. You've gotta help us.
Homer,Thank you so much.
Homer,"Honey, Daddy's waiting for the detective."
Homer,"Listen to 'em, watching my television, sittin' on my couch... You better not be in my ass-groove!"
Homer,It took me years to forge that groove.
Homer,Good Morning everybody.
Homer,Stupid Gravity.
Homer,I've got it!
Homer,"Aw, you can't outsmart carnival folk. They're the cleverest folk in the world. Just look at the way they sucker regular folk with those crooked games. That's it! Fire! Or..."
Homer,"I've got a proposition for you, Cooder."
Homer,"One game of ring toss. If I can throw this Hula Hoop onto the chimney, you'll give us our house back. If I miss, I'll sign the deed over to you."
Homer,That's right.
Homer,Now!
Homer,"Yeah, I guess your old man is smarter than you thought."
Homer,"Look at 'em standing out there. No place to go. Heh, heh. Poor guys. Hey, what if we let 'em stay here for just a few days?"
Homer,My groove!
Homer,They mushed it all out of shape.
Homer,"All right, better put on a pot of coffee, Marge. This could take a while."
Homer,"Come on now, just a little more. Little more to the left... to the left there. What did he do this thing? Almost... Ahhhhhhhhh"
Homer,"I always say, a boy can learn more at an airport than he can at any school."
Homer,"This, Bart, is a crazy man."
Homer,Right. That'll work.
Homer,Hmm. Makes sense.
Homer,How much is this free resort weekend?
Homer,And when is this weekend?
Homer,Uh huh. And how much does it cost?
Homer,I see. And when is it?
Homer,And what are you charging for this free weekend?
Homer,"It's free, right?"
Homer,"Who cares what it is? The point is these are some decent, generous people that I can take advantage of."
Homer,"Marge, Marge, Marge. Remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a time-share vacation condo?"
Homer,"So, I beat the system."
Homer,Yes. I am the highly suggestible type.
Homer,"Outta my way, jerk ass!"
Homer,"NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA FISH-ING / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA FISH-ING / FISH-ING, FISH-ING--"
Homer,Fish-ing.
Homer,Who the hell is that? Some kind of leader?
Homer,Will there be beer?
Homer,Homer no function beer well without.
Homer,What kind of beer?
Homer,Really? I'm surprised about Maggie.
Homer,"Wow, a free movie. Thanks! Outta my way, jerk ass."
Homer,"Whoa, you've got my number on that one, buddy! This is a smart group."
Homer,"Now wait a minute, Moe --"
Homer,Wait - I'm confused about the movie. So the cops knew that internal affairs was setting them up?
Homer,"Well, you see, when I get bored, I make up my own movie. I have a very short attention span."
Homer,"Ooh, look a bird."
Homer,"Uh yeah, I guess I could lose a few pounds. And I can be kind of thick sometimes."
Homer,"Oh, my mistake."
Homer,"You gonna finish that, bony?"
Homer,"NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / LEA-DER, LEA-DER, LEA-DER!"
Homer,"BATMAN! / I MEAN, LEADER! I LOVE THE LEADER!"
Homer,ACT II
Homer,"Come again, Marge?"
Homer,I've joined the Movementarians! And so have all of you!
Homer,"All I had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house, and a commitment of ten trillion years of labor."
Homer,"Marge, when I join an underground cult, I expect a little support from my family."
Homer,I have not been brainwashed. Kill the girl. Kill the girl.
Homer,What? What did I say?
Homer,Of course not! Except that we're all moving to the Movementarian Agricultural Compound to be near the Leader and serve him.
Homer,And it didn't cost us a dime.
Homer,"Hah, why even unpack?"
Homer,"That's a negatory, good buddy!"
Homer,"See, Marge? Our lives are so much better now!"
Homer,Oh boy! We get to see the Leader pass by.
Homer,"Yes, it would be nice if he'd buy American, but what are ya gonna do?"
Homer,I've never been so happy.
Homer,"But Marge, we're not mass married."
Homer,These lima beans are even better than the ones we had for breakfast and lunch. Oh! A lima bean that looks just like the Leader! I'll put it with the others.
Homer,What an honor! We've been called into the presence of --
Homer,Marge? You're the Leader? You don't look anything like the beans.
Homer,The Leader knows all and sees all.
Homer,And he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet.
Homer,Beer?
Homer,But I want to go.
Homer,"I'm glad I'm back! Because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue, I was born again!"
Homer,Now I can show all of you what I've come to realize. The reason we're not allowed in the Forbidden Barn is because there is no inter-galactic spaceship! He's taken our money just so he can...build one hell of a spaceship!
Homer,Whoops.
Homer,To think I turned to a cult for mindless happiness when I had beer all along.
Homer,"And you Marge, the bringer of beer!"
Homer,Yeah. He's my favorite fictional character.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Quiet. God looks like he has something important to say.
Homer,"I can't make it in today, Mr. Smithers. I have Smallpox... Well, it wasn't wiped out in my house."
Homer,"Water bill, third notice... jury duty, third notice... mortgage bill, ooh, second notice..."
Homer,Flancrest Enterprises?
Homer,You liar. You don't have a home business. Why would you make up a lie like that?
Homer,"Internet, eh?"
Homer,"Scratch, eh?"
Homer,"Maude, eh?"
Homer,"No time to answer that, Marge. I'm setting up a home office for my new business enterprise."
Homer,Ever heard of a little thing called the Internet?
Homer,"Oh yeah, everybody's making money off the Internet except us. We've fallen behind. Way behind."
Homer,"Can't discuss that now, Marge. I have to write another delicious memo."
Homer,Mmm... memo.
Homer,"What am I gonna call my Internet company? All the good names are taken. Oh, wait, I've got it! Flancrest Enterprises."
Homer,"Uh, this industry moves so fast, it's really hard to tell. That's why I need a name that's cutting edge, like Cutco... or Edgecom... Interslice... Come on, Marge -- you're good at these. Help me out."
Homer,"Fine. It's not important. What really matters is my title. I think I'll make myself Vice President. No, wait... Junior Vice President."
Homer,CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet. Junior Vice President Homer Simpson speaking. How may I direct your call?
Homer,It's Patty.
Homer,"Welcome to the Internet, my friend. How can I help you?"
Homer,Can I have some money now?
Homer,"Ooo, they have the Internet on computers now..."
Homer,"Bill Gates? Billionaire computer nerd Bill Gates? Oh my God, oh my God! Get out of sight, Marge! I don't want this to look like a two-bit operation!"
Homer,You don't look so rich.
Homer,"Get a load of the bowl job, Marge."
Homer,"This is it, Marge. I poured my heart and soul into this business, and now it's finally paying off! We're rich! Richer than astronauts!"
Homer,"Oh, right. I reluctantly accept your proposal."
Homer,"Hey, what the hell's going on?!"
Homer,"Well, maybe if he had better arch support, they wouldn't have caught him."
Homer,"Well, well, well... If it isn't Professor Know-it-all. 'Scuse me, Marge."
Homer,"That's where you're wrong, pal!"
Homer,It's not enough to want a cracker. You have to earn it!
Homer,"Why, yes. Yes I do."
Homer,A rest home for pirates?
Homer,Now that's a fight I wanna be a part of.
Homer,I don't get it.
Homer,I still don't get it.
Homer,Oh I get it. I get jokes.
Homer,"Yes! Yes! Oh, God yes!"
Homer,"Take that, Marge!"
Homer,"Woop, sorry son. I didn't know you, Jay Leno, and a monkey were bathing a clown."
Homer,Oooh! Oh! Krusty!
Homer,Booo!
Homer,I also have to go. Booo!
Homer,Krusty's gone nuts...
Homer,"I'll cover ya, honey."
Homer,Woo! TV! Yeah!
Homer,Impeach Churchill!
Homer,"Take that, you greedy fat cats. Marge, gimme your purse."
Homer,"From now on, I'm gonna be just like Krusty and tell it like it is. Marge, you're gettin' a little fat around the old thighs."
Homer,"You too, Bart."
Homer,"You didn't have to tell it like it is, Marge."
Homer,I hope he tells us to burn our pants. These things are drivin' me nuts!
Homer,Don't you hate pants?
Homer,"Hey, I thought your mother told you to take a bath."
Homer,"Aw, I understand, kids. I'm not a bath man myself -- more of a cologne man."
Homer,Don't worry. Daddy'll fix it.
Homer,Hmmm.
Homer,Outta my way! She's gonna blow!
Homer,Hi sweetie. I'm off to Moe's. Love ya.
Homer,To Marge. And all the blissful years I've spent hiding from her in this bar.
Homer,Whatever happened to your mail order bride?
Homer,So her career got in the way.
Homer,"Now, now, I won't hear of it, Moe. You're a fabulous catch."
Homer,He thought he was gonna steal--
Homer,"Oh, it's probably due to your ugliness. But that doesn't mean we can't find you a woman. Come on, we're goin' to the darkest bar in town."
Homer,Relax. All I smell is garlic and fish.
Homer,"Okay, I won't lie to you. A lot of people saw that. But you gotta keep tryin'."
Homer,"Hey, don't give up, Moe. The girl of your dreams has gotta be in some bar."
Homer,"Let's get out of here, Moe. This is goin' nowhere."
Homer,Stop kissing that cat and get in the car!
Homer,Maa-rrge...
Homer,"Oh, yeah, I got that."
Homer,"Aw, come on, Moe. Think of all you have to offer besides money."
Homer,"If you really need money, you could sell a kidney, or maybe even your car."
Homer,"Steal? Oh no, you got the wrong guy."
Homer,You dropped somethin'.
Homer,"Oh, you did. But -- I still don't know... I can just imagine what Marge would say."
Homer,I'll do it!
Homer,Mmmm... me.
Homer,What about the cops?
Homer,"So, as soon as you get back, we steal the car, right?"
Homer,"You're a genius, Moe. All your troubles will soon be over for a couple months."
Homer,Why all the pearls? Why all the hair? Why anything?
Homer,"No, you look a little nervous, Lisa."
Homer,No. I'm just going out to commit certain deeds.
Homer,Suckers.
Homer,I'm gonna be the best car thief ever.
Homer,"Hey! Oh, no you don't!"
Homer,"""Stealing, stealing / Stealing a car for Moe / Dada dada dada dada / Insurance fraud today..."""
Homer,"They're showing ""Hail to the Chimp!"" Oh, I have time to see one little movie!"
Homer,That's what you get for not hailing to the Chimp.
Homer,"Oh, no! The train!"
Homer,I gotta find another way to wreck Moe's car!
Homer,"Homer, you genius."
Homer,Ger-onimo!
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Whoa! Hang on a minute! The guard said I have visitors coming!
Homer,"Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh! Great! Listen, I know it looks bad. But all I can tell you is I destroyed that car for all the right reasons."
Homer,"That's my girl. You just go home, and don't worry your pretty blue head about it. Moe will take care of everything."
Homer,"Aw, thanks, boy. I'll give you two packs for that candy bar."
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"Moe! Oh, Moe, thank God you're here!"
Homer,But I'm in jail.
Homer,"Moe, you gotta get me outta here. Tell the cops I didn't steal the car. Say you lent it to me."
Homer,"But Moe, we're best friends..."
Homer,"Hurry, Moe. At three o'clock they're going to put us in the exercise yard. The exercise yard!"
Homer,"Hurry up, Moe, for the love of God! Hurry up!"
Homer,Hawaii? What about Hawaii? Moe? Who's going to Hawaii? Am I going to Hawaii?
Homer,"Let me out! I'm innocent! I changed my mind, I don't want to be in here anymore!"
Homer,Hmm... This could be useful...
Homer,Must kill Moe. Wheeeeee! Must kill Moe. Wheeeeee!
Homer,You!
Homer,"Oh-ho, I'll help you. Help you die!"
Homer,"I... also sleep... G'night, Mommy..."
Homer,"Ohh, I could never stay mad at you, Moe. After all, you get me drunk."
Homer,"Aw, Moe, Moe, Moe, dry those beady little eyes. Your buddy Homer'll get you back on your feet."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Um, I'm looking for something in an after-dinner burrito."
Homer,"Oh, forget it!"
Homer,"Well, why would I want to look at a pen with a... Oh no, her clothes are coming off! Heh, heh. Hey, you know who would love this? Men."
Homer,"Five, four, three, two, one, lift-off!"
Homer,"Hey, hey look, a freezer man!"
Homer,I have frozen myself so I may live to see the wonders of the future. Thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. P.S. Please alter my pants as fashion dictates.
Homer,"Now you're swingin', honey!"
Homer,That makes 22 to 16.
Homer,Room for one more...
Homer,"Hey, yeah."
Homer,Bo-ring!
Homer,"Boy, seeing that stomach surgery made me hungry! Marge, we need five thousand CC's of snacks, stat!"
Homer,"C'mon, Lisa, join the family!"
Homer,"What way, angel pie?"
Homer,"Fine, she doesn't get her skin!"
Homer,"If I were her, I'd be buying me a great big chocolate apology cake."
Homer,Moochin' war widows...
Homer,That's a good idea. Let's go out for some frosty swirls.
Homer,We'll tape it!
Homer,"Pff... ""Simpson gene!"" Somebody's got to set that girl straight. And I know how to do it."
Homer,"Marge, get me your address book, four beers, and my conversation hat."
Homer,"Lisa, it's me, Daddy, your father. I rounded up every Simpson in the tri-city area, so I can prove to you there's nothing wrong with the Simpson genes. This is your Great-Uncle Chet. Go ahead, Chet, tell her what you do."
Homer,"Oh. But... you run it, right?"
Homer,"Okay. Uh, this is your second cousin Stanley."
Homer,Everybody hates birds! ...Right!
Homer,"Well uh, you look pretty successful."
Homer,What about you?
Homer,"Oh, Lisa's right. We're nothing but a big bunch of losers. Show's over, folks. Go home."
Homer,You get it after you leave. Now get out of here.
Homer,"Fine, fine. What do you do... ""Dr. Simpson""?"
Homer,"Oh well, thanks, honey. Remember, there's nothing that says you can't be a Simpson and a success."
Homer,"Yes, son. A spectacular failure."
Homer,"Yeah. Good things don't end with ""eum."" They end with ""mania""... Or ""teria."" Will there be beer?"
Homer,What'd he say? What about my car?
Homer,I'm gonna try the sex education computer!
Homer,"Ovulate, damn you! Ovulate!"
Homer,"Then me and my friend were about to press it, but the man said not to press it. But we pressed it anyway and we ran and we hid in the giant tire. Oh yeah, and my other friend was already there."
Homer,"Woo hoo! Beer, beer, beer!"
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"""Hi, this is Jerry Maguire. Show me the message. Show me the message."""
Homer,"""Do the message! Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da."""
Homer,"""Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da."" ""After the beep."""
Homer,"You're the man, Ralph!"
Homer,"Uh, Maybe."
Homer,"Yep, I earned it."
Homer,"Mmmm, donuts."
Homer,"Gentlemen, there's only one solution. We place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation, thereby making it big."
Homer,Success!
Homer,It's my first day.
Homer,It's my first day.
Homer,Fired. I can't believe it.
Homer,"Ooh, funky."
Homer,I've joined the naval reserve.
Homer,"You know Lisa, I've taken a lot from this country. Maybe it's time I gave something back."
Homer,Would you be proud of me?
Homer,Then I'll do it!
Homer,There's a question that's crossed out.
Homer,"Well, I think I can make it out. ""Are you a homosex..."""
Homer,But I'm not a h--
Homer,Nice fella. I wonder if he's gay?
Homer,"Not to worry, honey. We live in a highly technological age, where fighting a war is as simple as turning off a light."
Homer,"Sorry, can't hear you, Marge. I'm clapping."
Homer,Nighty-night!
Homer,"Well, guys, I won't be seeing you for a while."
Homer,"Gee, thanks guys. This is just like ""The Deer Hunter."""
Homer,See ya in a week.
Homer,"Aw, that's sweet, honey. I'll bring you back a hat."
Homer,No.
Homer,"Oh, he did, did he? I'll show him! I'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power!"
Homer,But only if you're good. Even if you're not.
Homer,"No way, man! My hair is who I am!"
Homer,I'm a freak!
Homer,What the--?
Homer,"Uh, a seagull took my sailor hat."
Homer,I like you.
Homer,Maybe you would like me if you got to know me.
Homer,"Well, I'm no Margaret Cho, but I do a pretty fair Columbo impression. Ah, one more thing - One- I should get a glass of water."
Homer,There! The perfect sheepshank.
Homer,Ulll.....
Homer,Request permission to come aboard.
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"You know Marge, joining the reserves was the best thing I ever did. I feel good about myself, I'm helping my country, and later, I'm gonna get Gilligan's autograph."
Homer,Then I'll whomp him with my hat.
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"Get back here, boy!"
Homer,You're a disgrace to this family and its proud Naval tradition!
Homer,I always thought Lisa would be the one to get her ears pierced.
Homer,No!
Homer,Nu-cue-lar. It's pronounced NU-cue-lar.
Homer,"Oh, Lisa, it's just war games. It's not like a game could hurt me."
Homer,"Damn you, rock'em sock'em robots! Can't we all just get along?"
Homer,We have orders not to fire on anybody but Greenpeace.
Homer,"Well, I guess that's everyone. Except earring-boy."
Homer,"Well, when I was ten I got my ear pierced but this is completely different!"
Homer,"Uh, is the poopdeck really what I think it is?"
Homer,What's a jib?
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,I want peas.
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,With a knife.
Homer,And you're like the father I never visit.
Homer,Me?
Homer,"Ooh, comfy."
Homer,I'unno.
Homer,Hmm. What would the Captain say in my spot?
Homer,Fire the torpedoes!
Homer,"All right, all right, mellow out, everybody. The Captain'll know what to do."
Homer,I am?
Homer,Very well then. I'm a Captain.
Homer,Mr. Moe -- steady as she goes!
Homer,"Damage report, Mr. Moe."
Homer,Enough of what's out! What's in?
Homer,"Yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way."
Homer,"Don't worry, I've been working on it. Hm... yes... uh huh... carry the two..."
Homer,All right. I can't waste any more time. People's lives are depending on me. Mr. Sulu -- make a left!
Homer,That's it. Left. Left. Steady as she goes.
Homer,"On second thought, go right."
Homer,Oh my God! We're all gonna die!
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,You mean water?
Homer,I guess that's it. Ladies and gentlemen... We're in a tough spot and I don't know if we're gonna get out. Please remain calm and think of your loved ones.
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"I'll plug your hole. I mean, eureka!"
Homer,"Mr. Moe, prepare to surface."
Homer,Uhhh... it's my first day!
Homer,Es mi dia primero. Wuo gang kai shuchun gong chuo Quack quack quack.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"You can't spell ""dishonorable"" without ""honorable."""
Homer,"Well, I couldn't have done it without Bart."
Homer,"Boy, I guess I was wrong about that earring. It saved us all."
Homer,"I don't think so, son."
Homer,No.
Homer,Ask your mother.
Homer,No.
Homer,Maybe for Christmas.
Homer,"Oh, will this horrible year never end?"
Homer,Will you look at those morons? I paid my taxes over a year ago.
Homer,"What is it, Sweetie? Did you see a scary picture in your picture book?"
Homer,"No, because... You see I went ahead and... Year-wise, I was counting forward from the last previous..."
Homer,I have a to do pile?
Homer,"Marge, how many kids do we have? Oh, no time to count, I'll just estimate. Uh, nine."
Homer,"Shutup! Shutup! If I don't hear you, it's not illegal. Okay, I need some deductions! Deductions! Ah! Business gifts!"
Homer,Here you go. Keep using nuclear power.
Homer,"Okay, Marge, if anyone asks, you require 24-hour nursing care, Lisa's a clergyman, Maggie is seven people and Bart was wounded in Vietnam..."
Homer,"If I don't see it, it's not illegal!"
Homer,"Oh, no you don't!"
Homer,"C'mon, get in there. Drop."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Well...
Homer,Help! Somebody!
Homer,"No, sir. I'm really sorry sir. An older boy told me to do it."
Homer,"No sir, please. I can't go to prison. They pee in a cup and throw it on ya. I saw it in a movie!"
Homer,"No, please, I'll do anything!"
Homer,I'm very happy to meet you.
Homer,"Okay, but could you pay me under the table? I got a little tax problem."
Homer,"Not spy, squeal. I've got no choice."
Homer,"Quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. It goes all the way to the president."
Homer,Does this make me look fat?
Homer,But not fat.
Homer,"So if my cover gets blown and I need help, what's the signal?"
Homer,"Hey, I see you're watchin' the ball game. Looks like a good one. Any of you involved in any illegal activity? Cause I could sure go for some."
Homer,"How 'bout you, Lenny? Testing, testing? Lenny?"
Homer,Maybe. But first I need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.
Homer,"Uhhhh, like those. But involving you."
Homer,Barney? That was me! And I'd do it again.
Homer,"Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe. End transmission."
Homer,"Well, I'm just glad it's all over."
Homer,"Why do you keep picking on me? Marge's name was on that tax return, too."
Homer,Walk? That wasn't part of the deal.
Homer,Losers...
Homer,Ooh! A trillion-dollar bill? 'Atsa spicy meatball!
Homer,"But Mr. Burns gave me my job. And he hasn't fired me, even after three meltdowns and one China Syndrome. I can't betray him."
Homer,I'm in.
Homer,"Uh, I'm Homer Simpson, your trusted employee."
Homer,"Uhh, I don't know what to tell you."
Homer,"Well, Mr. Burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside..."
Homer,Still cold.
Homer,Starting search for trillion-dollar bill.
Homer,"C'mon... Where are you?... Here, Trilly, Trilly."
Homer,Uhmmmm... Errr... Uhhhhh...
Homer,"Uh, yeah, sure. That thing."
Homer,"No you don't. Heh, heh."
Homer,Ewww!
Homer,Is that a fish?
Homer,"Hey, that guy looks like you."
Homer,Is that the trillion-dollar bill in his hand?
Homer,"Wowww, that must be worth a fortune."
Homer,"Hey, he's right..."
Homer,I'm gonna write the best darn article... Oh wait.
Homer,"Take that, Uncle Sam!"
Homer,We'll hide out at my place. I've got beer.
Homer,"Ohh, we're never gonna make it. Let's just divide up the trillion now, and go our separate ways."
Homer,But I can't leave the country! What about my wife and kids?
Homer,We'd better do what he says.
Homer,Woo hoo! We can gamble!
Homer,Yes!
Homer,I call President!
Homer,"Oh, you're gonna love it in Cuba, Marge. There's shredded pork everywhere."
Homer,Nice to meet you.
Homer,I had no idea.
Homer,"Mr. Burns, I think we can trust the President of Cuba."
Homer,"It's hard to believe there's a place worse than America, but we found it."
Homer,God bless America!
Homer,"Oooh, the gum with the cracker center. Mmm."
Homer,"That'll do it, Apu. So just--"
Homer,"Helper monkey, eh?"
Homer,"I'd like a monkey, please. And maybe one of those dogs. What do they do?"
Homer,Do they do any other tricks?
Homer,Just the monkey then.
Homer,"Oh-ho-ho, I'm not handicapped. I'm just lazy."
Homer,"Enfeebled?! Oo, I know just the guy! Be right back."
Homer,Mind if I take him for a ride?
Homer,"There a problem, honey?"
Homer,"Relax. It's only Mojo. Mojo, Marge. Marge, Mojo. He can do anything you show him. Watch."
Homer,Simpson residence.
Homer,"This ""filthy monkey"" made the orange juice you're drinking."
Homer,Marge! The kids are on!
Homer,"Honey, he's clearly marked his territory."
Homer,"Marge, can I get a duck?"
Homer,Can he get a duck?
Homer,Come on. Come to Poppa.
Homer,"Good boy, Mojo. Now, bring 'em down and I'll give you one."
Homer,Would you... Stop that! You're a helper monkey. This isn't helping!
Homer,"Oh, I don't need your pity."
Homer,And so on.
Homer,"Mojo, will you wipe my mouth?"
Homer,What do you want? His cholesterol's through the roof.
Homer,"No, no. He's fine. Go on, Mojo, show Marge your happy dance."
Homer,"Lisa, don't you ruin another Love Day."
Homer,They didn't have Lord Huggington?
Homer,I guess.
Homer,Kiss it.
Homer,Oh-ho yeahhh...
Homer,"Yes, but the memories will last a lifetime."
Homer,Crap -- py -- stuff.
Homer,Nuh-uh. It isn't filled until it's spilled.
Homer,"Ooh, but I can rebuild!"
Homer,"Ow-ow, stupid-trash, rotten-stinky, hate-world, revenge-soon, take out on everyone... Garbage water! Oh-ho-ho!"
Homer,"You're pushin' me, baby."
Homer,Hey wait! Stop! I have garbage!
Homer,"You guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! You trash-eatin' stink bags!"
Homer,Uh oh.
Homer,I don't know. A lot of people were yelling stuff.
Homer,"That was yesterday, moron!"
Homer,"Good news, everyone. I got in a fight with the garbage men and they're cutting off our service."
Homer,"Hey, I'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men."
Homer,"I never apologize, Lisa. I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am."
Homer,"Siddown, honey. The men will clear the table!"
Homer,"So long, chicken bone."
Homer,"No room for you, Jell-O."
Homer,Sorry Ned. I didn't see you down there. Got him.
Homer,Then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits Diaper Hill.
Homer,"So-ho, the rats seem happy."
Homer,That's not the way she tells it.
Homer,"Uh, it's like the measles. Good to get it out of the way."
Homer,"Yeah, but I'm always secretly disappointed when you do. Anyway, I think those garbage men are starting to crack."
Homer,Apologize for that remark.
Homer,Attaboy!
Homer,"Good morning, Trash Pile. How's about..."
Homer,Hey! Woo-hoo! I won!
Homer,"This is a very, very proud day for us, especially me. Your father, me, beat City Hall. It's just like David and Goliath, only this time David won."
Homer,"And to think you wanted me to crawl, Marge! Well, this man doesn't crawl. He stands tall. That rhymes, Marge, and you know it rhymes. Admit it!"
Homer,You signed my name? I feel so violated.
Homer,"But this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. And I'm going to get it back. Lisa, do I have my pants on?"
Homer,Perfect.
Homer,"Don't come off all high and mighty with me, Patterson. You can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp."
Homer,"Oh, oh, oh, I get it. Put on a big show for the cameras."
Homer,"I came to fight City Hall. I wanna shake things up, Patterson. Stir up some controversy. Rattle a few cages."
Homer,"You'll never silence me! I'm the last angry man, Patterson! A crusader for the little guy!"
Homer,Never!
Homer,You want to know what I think?
Homer,"Well, we'll see about that."
Homer,I want to register to run for Sanitation Commissioner. And tell the fatcats upstairs -- things are gonna change in this town!
Homer,"Why you little... No one's gonna beat ya, son. You're gonna get such a beating."
Homer,"Hey, vote Simpson... Hi... Nice to see ya... Heh, thanks for comin' out... Keep puttin' on weight, huh? Lenny, my man."
Homer,"What am I, the answer man? Just vote for me."
Homer,These old geezers just don't get it. It's time to rock the vote.
Homer,Potato man.
Homer,"Take a hike, Kojak."
Homer,"Hellooo Springfield! It's me, Homer!"
Homer,"Quiet, you! I know you youngsters wanna see these rockin' rockers. But I also know you care about the race for Sanitation Commissioner. So, let me give ya the 911..."
Homer,"That's a good question, Bono. 'Cause I'd be the most wack, tripped-out Sanitation Commissioner ever! Can ya dig it?"
Homer,"Ow! Oh, Bono! Help me!"
Homer,"My campaign is a disaster, Moe."
Homer,"I hate the public so much. If only they'd elect me... I'd make 'em pay. Oh Moe, how do I make 'em like me?"
Homer,Can't someone else do it?
Homer,It is?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Can't someone else do it?
Homer,Fellow citizens! How would you rate the trash service in this town?
Homer,"Uh, okay, it's excellent. But aren't you tired of waking up early and dragging the garbage to the curb?"
Homer,Aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty Kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?
Homer,Well then...
Homer,"Well then, can't someone else do it?"
Homer,And can't someone else scoop out that nasty kitty litter?
Homer,"Well, Ray Patterson thinks you should do it! Animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. Did we lose a war? That's not America. That's not even Mexico."
Homer,Don't you deserve better than the best?
Homer,Who should handle all your dirty jobs?
Homer,I'm sorry my opponent didn't think enough of you to show up for this debate. I'm sure he had more important things to do.
Homer,"Well, then you shoulda been early."
Homer,"Not if we hire more men. And my men will do all your messy jobs. They'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables..."
Homer,"Well, then you'd better turn up your hearing aid, Pops."
Homer,Do we want old man Patterson here with his finger on the button?
Homer,What-what-what. What button? Where am I? Who took my false teeth?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Fifty cents? Not likely.
Homer,"Hey, Ray. Cleanin' out the old office, eh?"
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Ray. Are we gonna let politics get in the way of our friendship?"
Homer,"Yeah, that was just a lie."
Homer,"See? We're still friends. C'mon, give us a cuddle."
Homer,"Jean-Paul, how are the new uniforms? Do they match the suede boots? Beautiful. Did you get the new trucks? Are they amphibious? Well, there's only one way to find out. We can always buy more."
Homer,"Yes, I gotta work hard, honey. Daddy made a lot of crazy promises."
Homer,"Oh, the garbage man can, Marge. The garbage man can."
Homer,WHO CAN TAKE YOUR TRASH OUT? / STOMP IT DOWN FOR YOU? / SHAKE THE PLASTIC BAG AND DO THE TWISTY-THINGY TOO? / THE GARBAGE MAN...
Homer,"Oh no! Wait, I think I've got the perfect solution."
Homer,Patterson was right. I'm crashing and burning... crashing and burning...
Homer,"They let me sign checks with a stamp, Marge. A stamp!"
Homer,"Wait, shutup... I just thought of something!"
Homer,"'Mornin', boys."
Homer,Will cash be okay?
Homer,"Okay, before I show ya, who wants to guess how I got the money?"
Homer,"Close, but you're way off."
Homer,"Look at that beautiful garbage! Other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it in this old abandoned mine."
Homer,Marge... ix-nay on the ash-hole-tray.
Homer,"Sure I can, Honey-kitten."
Homer,"Uh, nothin'."
Homer,"Now, uh, you were saying how great I was...?"
Homer,Nay!
Homer,Come to what?
Homer,"Yeah, it's somethin', all right."
Homer,"Yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? If you need me, I'll be at Moe's."
Homer,Hi Moe.
Homer,"Yeah, but can he do this?"
Homer,What? They had a picnic last week.
Homer,"If God didn't want us to eat in church, he would have made gluttony a sin."
Homer,"Ooo, still plenty of parking."
Homer,"Yeah, out of the way, whoever you are. You're blocking the food."
Homer,"Sorry, son, Daddy's down for the day. Why don't you go capture me some more potato salad?"
Homer,Flanders is playing? Why didn't you say so?
Homer,I agree. Let's surrender.
Homer,"Hmm... All right, but don't lose them. They're my only pair."
Homer,Stupid kids...
Homer,Time out... t... time out...
Homer,"Oh, stop it!"
Homer,I've never seen Bart so ashamed of me.
Homer,"Oh, Marge. How could you let me let myself go like this?"
Homer,"Yeah, well, I've humiliated my son for the last time. I'm going to get into shape."
Homer,"No, I mean it. I'm really serious this time."
Homer,"Okay, boy, I want you to keep this exercise thing under your hat. That way I won't be embarrassed if I fail."
Homer,"Oh, great. Now the cat knows."
Homer,"Okay, here we go..."
Homer,"Look, son. Daddy got in shape. E--"
Homer,"I've got to keep trying! Or I could just move that picture. No! The picture looked good where it was. Boy, drag me back outside."
Homer,Uhh... Don't you have anything healthy here?
Homer,"Hey, these Power Sauce bars look pretty healthy."
Homer,"Hmm... A bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. Wow."
Homer,"Gym? What's a ""Gym?"""
Homer,Ohhh... a gym.
Homer,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Boy, am I feeling this. Ow! Oh, my head's gonna be sore in the morning. Ow!"
Homer,"Ranier Wolfcastle! Oh, I love your movies and your Power Sauce bars and your taut, rippling--"
Homer,"Wow, Wolfie. Two months ago I didn't know what the word ""dumbbell"" meant. This place is great."
Homer,"Hello, handsome. Nice muscles. Care for a rubdown? Oh-ho, well, I'm flattered, but spoken for. Oh, what the heck, give me your number."
Homer,I have been working out secretly at night. And look at me now!
Homer,"Heh, heh, heh. Go ahead. Try and grab some flab. Go on. Ju--"
Homer,"No, not there."
Homer,Not there either. Over here.
Homer,"No, here. Try my foot. No, not that foot. Just feel my biceps."
Homer,"Well, whaddaya think of your old man now, son?"
Homer,Damn right.
Homer,How can you put that filth into your bodies?
Homer,"Look at you people. Bart's a tub, Lisa's weak as a little girl, and Maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all."
Homer,"You too, Marge. If you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action."
Homer,"Sorry, I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar."
Homer,Hm.
Homer,"Hospital, please."
Homer,"Yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone."
Homer,"Overshoot the extreme, max the envelope, and so on."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,I am?
Homer,"Okay, mountain-climbing supplies: rope, ice axe, heart medicine..."
Homer,You? Did?
Homer,"If you're trying to scare me, it won't work. I'm one hundred percent focused on my goal. Hey, my hat has ear flaps!"
Homer,Huh?... Wha ya?... Hey! You guys are dragging me up the mountain.
Homer,"That's right, Brad and Neil. I only eat Power Sauce -- the bar with Apple-saucicity."
Homer,"Aww. Goodbye, everyone. Don't touch my stuff."
Homer,"Well, yeah..."
Homer,"Oh, man, this is hard."
Homer,"Bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal I have ever faced."
Homer,Wow! Look how far I climbed! And I'm not even tired!
Homer,"Wake up, you lazy Sherpas. We've got a mountain to climb!"
Homer,"So nobody believes I can do this, huh? Well, my son does. And I'm not gonna let him down. I'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own."
Homer,Shut up. You are so fired.
Homer,"Homer Simpson here. I've sent the Sherpas home and I'm heading for the top, solo."
Homer,The hell I won't. You're forgetting I've got my Power Sauce bars.
Homer,"Hey, Deng Xiao-Ping died."
Homer,Forget it. I'll be at the top by noon. Over and out.
Homer,"Air's getting thin, but I'm gonna make it. Woo! Getting lightheaded... Good -- no heavy head to carry. Wait! I'll just take that escalator!"
Homer,La la la la la la la la...
Homer,La la la la la la la la la...
Homer,Just a few feet more...
Homer,"I did it! I made it all the way to... Aw, crap!"
Homer,"It just keeps going! I give up. You beat me, mountain!"
Homer,At least I won't freeze to death.
Homer,"""Last entry. I have mountaineered to the utmost, but the peak is unclimbable. Worse still, that treacherous skunk Abe Simpson stole my oxygen, and tried to eat my left arm."""
Homer,"Ew, Dad. ""Tell my beloved wife my last thoughts were of her, blinding and torturing Abe Simpson. Cheerio."""
Homer,"My Dad's a disgrace, just like Bart's Dad. Me."
Homer,"This may not be the top, but it's as close as a Simpson's ever gonna get."
Homer,"This is for you, son."
Homer,"Hey. Wait a minute. I'm on the top. I actually did it. I climbed the unclimbable mountain! Bow down before me, everyone! For I am your KING!"
Homer,Hi.
Homer,"Oh, Marge, I never thought you'd see me again."
Homer,"Why don't you tell me, son? See any interesting flags up there?"
Homer,"Aw, dammit!"
Homer,"Thanks, Bart. That makes it all worthwhile."
Homer,"'Mornin', Barney."
Homer,"Huh? Whuh? Hyuwhuh? I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm a productive member of the team! You can't fire me, I quit! Please, I have a family! Well, let's see what we got in the ol' drawer."
Homer,Eh. Eh.
Homer,Aha. There's some glue.
Homer,Hope this stuff holds.
Homer,Hello?
Homer,Who is this?
Homer,Museum? I don't like the sound of that. What did your mother say?
Homer,"Hmm. So you want to take the bus, huh? I don't know. That's a pretty big decision..."
Homer,Two hundred dollars?! Isn't there any other way?
Homer,"Frankly, I do. I know you had your heart set on a limo, but sometimes daddies have to say no, honey. I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the bus."
Homer,"Atta girl. I love you, sweet --"
Homer,"My daughter's at that Egyptian dealy right now. She wanted to take a limo, but I made her take the bus."
Homer,"MMMaybe... but you don't know Lisa. I mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire."
Homer,"Uh, yesss... but now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter."
Homer,Lisa!
Homer,Lisa?! Lisa?! Li-sa?!
Homer,"Oh, where is she?"
Homer,Has anyone seen my little girl?
Homer,"For God's sakes, my little girl is--"
Homer,Hello.
Homer,I am at work. This is what I do.
Homer,"Keep it moving, Marge. This isn't a parking lot."
Homer,"Uh, yes sir, Mr. Burns, sir."
Homer,"Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this girl?"
Homer,Lisa... Lisa...
Homer,This is no good. I've got to get up higher.
Homer,Give me all your balloons.
Homer,I hope this works...
Homer,These are for you if you let me use your cherry picker.
Homer,Lisa? Lisa? Lisa!
Homer,Stay there! I'll come down and save you!
Homer,Lisa! Save me!
Homer,"Oh, no! I'm gonna go off the end of the --"
Homer,"I'm not normally a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman."
Homer,"Oh, Lisa, thank God you're okay!"
Homer,Ow! Ow! Ow! Oww!
Homer,"Nah, I'll just walk it off."
Homer,Don't ever say that.
Homer,"If I hadn'ta taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker, I never would have found you."
Homer,"Stupid risks are what make life worth living. Now your mother, she's the steady type, and that's fine in small doses. But me, I'm a risk taker. And that's why I have so many adventures."
Homer,"Feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? That's what my heart's doing all the time. Bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?"
Homer,"I'm enjoying my life too much to care. And you should be too. So what would you like to do right now, more than anything in the world?!"
Homer,"Closed, eh? So getting in would be a pretty big risk. What do you say, honey? Feeling stupid? I know I am."
Homer,Just a little higher...
Homer,Good. You're gonna need that adrenaline to make the final jump.
Homer,Could you open the window? The cops have Daddy's prints on file.
Homer,Uh... not this exquisite.
Homer,"Well, Daddy will figure it out."
Homer,"Lisa, you can't go this far and then not go further."
Homer,"Oh, so now it's we, eh."
Homer,"Anytime, honey. Just remember, never be afraid to live life on the edge. Now let's get home before your mother kills us."
Homer,"Yeah... but it'll always live on, because we'll never forget it."
Homer,It is? Well... that's a good song too. Do do do do-do do do...
Homer,Run!
Homer,"Look, honey, I clipped on my tie all by myself."
Homer,"Oh, Happy Anniversary, Marge."
Homer,"Hey, look what was in here. A program from that guy's funeral."
Homer,"Yeah, him. Whatever happened to that guy?"
Homer,"But Marge, the Gilded Truffle is an intimate, elegant place."
Homer,You mean there's been cake in our freezer for eleven years? Why was I not informed?
Homer,"Hey Marge, wouldn't it be weird if they had little parties at night? Wee little parties?"
Homer,Gotcha!
Homer,"Another super year with a super lady. Good night, honey."
Homer,"You know, um, it is a special occasion..."
Homer,Yeah. Seems like the thing to do.
Homer,"So, you gonna..."
Homer,"Oh. No. No, I'm the guy. I'm supposed to, uh..."
Homer,"I know, but let me get you started first."
Homer,All right. How's that?
Homer,"Oh, sorry."
Homer,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Homer,"No, no. Don't do that."
Homer,"I know, but I don't like it."
Homer,Ahh!
Homer,Look who's here!
Homer,He's the best boy!
Homer,"Hey, Marge, wasn't that great when the dog came in here?"
Homer,I love that dog.
Homer,G'night.
Homer,"Hmm, that's queer."
Homer,What?
Homer,The food!
Homer,Why did this happen? Whyyyyyy?
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"It was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor. Plus I'd just fallen on my back, which hurt more than I let on."
Homer,"Eh, I never thought I'd live this long."
Homer,"I'll get us out of this, honey. It's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin'."
Homer,Hmmm...
Homer,"When you think about it, mud is nothing but wet dirt."
Homer,Shhh. We're trespassing. And some of these farmers have pitchforks.
Homer,That was close!
Homer,"At your service, milady."
Homer,Cara mia...
Homer,"Bart, I told you not to leave that TV on."
Homer,"No, no, honey. Maybe this will help."
Homer,"Sorry, guys. Marge and I are spending the weekend at a bed and breakfast."
Homer,"Nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex and all."
Homer,"Now they did say bed and breakfast, right?"
Homer,"If there's anything more exquisite than Queen Anne's lace, I haven't found it."
Homer,Are you ready to rock? 'Cause heeere we go!
Homer,"Um, no time like the present."
Homer,"Well, yeah, kinda..."
Homer,Did that butter churn just move? 'Cause if it did...
Homer,Mine too. Just like back in that hay loft.
Homer,"There's the dirty girl I married. Come on, I have a disgusting idea."
Homer,They didn't hear us in the sewing room.
Homer,"Hello, everybody."
Homer,Bart! Yes.
Homer,Awww... Eskimo kiss!
Homer,I don't think anything I've ever done is wrong.
Homer,Not yet. Wait... wait... wait... now!
Homer,It hasn't changed since that magical evening when I knocked you up.
Homer,"Yeah, I thought Bart would be born a dimwit."
Homer,"Well, this time I'm drunk on love... and beer."
Homer,"Oh, why can't they just play through?"
Homer,"Ohh, why are people always trying to kill me?"
Homer,"Marge, can we trade? I don't trust these guys."
Homer,"Y'know, all this danger is kind of a turn--"
Homer,Okay!
Homer,Gil! Thank God it's you. You gotta help us.
Homer,"Honey, my shoulders are separating."
Homer,"Oh, we're surrounded, Marge. Maybe we should give ourselves up."
Homer,"Yeah, the British tabloids will have a field day. There's only one thing left to do."
Homer,"Grab onto the handles, Marge."
Homer,"Okay, I think I've figured this thing out. It can go up and down, but not side to side, or back in time."
Homer,These have pleats...
Homer,"I'm okay, honey. Now listen very carefully. I want you to pull on the thing that's near the other thing."
Homer,"No, that was not the thing."
Homer,Thank you...
Homer,"Marge, uh, can we not land here?... Honey?... Baby doll...?"
Homer,Why don't you take a picture? It lasts longer.
Homer,Dads especially!
Homer,Scary ways. But we never intended it to end like that. With thousands of people staring at our naked bodies.
Homer,Who's in the mood for miniature golf?
Homer,Can't you just write on your arm like I do?
Homer,"Yo, Apu, gimme the usual."
Homer,"Hey, this hot dog tastes different."
Homer,"Uh, yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus."
Homer,People buy grease?
Homer,"Used grease is worth money? Then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. I'm rich, Apu! Rich, I--!"
Homer,Money in the bank.
Homer,"Okay, this bacon's done."
Homer,And now for the profit taking.
Homer,Looks like he's about ready for another squeezin'.
Homer,"Marge, if you don't mind, I'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence."
Homer,"No, through savings and wise investments. Of course with grease!"
Homer,Where do you think you're goin'?
Homer,Not for you it isn't. You're in the grease business now.
Homer,"Okay, boy, this is where all the hard work, sacrifice, and painful scaldings pay off."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Yeah, but your Mom paid for that."
Homer,And I get my money from grease. What's the problem?
Homer,"Wow, look at that load of grease. Boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation."
Homer,"Oh, you'll miss plenty. I have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives."
Homer,"Li-sa, I can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. But apparently this new girl is. So my advice would be to start copying her in every way."
Homer,"Uh-uh, think. Is that what Alex would say?"
Homer,Oh I'll say. Look at that redheaded kid. There must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone.
Homer,All right. We'll try it your way.
Homer,"My God, you're greasy."
Homer,"If she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys."
Homer,"Hey, what the...?"
Homer,"Hey, hey, you're taking our grease!"
Homer,"Hey, that's my shovel."
Homer,"Oh, I can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business. I've been muscled out of everything I've ever done, including my muscle-for-hire business."
Homer,"Oh, what's the point?"
Homer,"Emus? Really? Oh, that's pretty crazy... Nah... I'd only fail just like I fail at everything."
Homer,"Wait a minute. The boy's right! I can't quit now. Aww, you always know just what to say to cheer me up. Emu farm... You're priceless, Marge."
Homer,"All right, son, we're about to embark on our most difficult mission. Let's bow our heads in prayer."
Homer,"Dear Lord, I know you're busy, seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that. But if you help us steal this grease tonight, I promise we'll donate half the profits to charity."
Homer,"All right, screw it. Let's roll."
Homer,Mmm... I knew I should have attached those somehow.
Homer,"This better work, boy. I don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm."
Homer,"Okay, turn on the suction."
Homer,It's not working.
Homer,What is it?
Homer,Bringin' up the rear.
Homer,"Oh, yeah."
Homer,"Well, here goes..."
Homer,And now we wait. So... is this your school?
Homer,"Uhhhh... we're, uh, new foreign exchange students from, uh... um... Scotland."
Homer,Uhh... North... Kilt... town?
Homer,"Wait a minute, there's no Angus MacCloud in North Kilt-town. Why you're not from Scotland at all!"
Homer,Ow! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful!
Homer,"Bart, please. The groundskeeper and I are trying to settle this like adults."
Homer,That's my grease! It's mine! Give it here!
Homer,Website.
Homer,Seventy-six point two?! But I'm already thirty-eight point one! I've wasted half my life!
Homer,Half my life gone! And I'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years.
Homer,Marge! I've wasted half my life.
Homer,"What are you talking about, Marge? I don't need a..."
Homer,"Okay, send the truck."
Homer,"No, I don't deserve sugar. I'm halfway to my grave, and I haven't accomplished anything. Oh, I am not looking forward to my funeral."
Homer,"Marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise me you won't vote for Lenny."
Homer,"Oh yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that."
Homer,"I've wasted half my life, Marge. Do you know how many memories I have? Three! Standing in line for a movie, having a key made, and sitting here talking to you. Thirty-eight years and that's all I have to show for it."
Homer,Cold.
Homer,Oh. I see you're having a party. I'll come back later.
Homer,"Oh, all right. Maybe I can pinpoint where my life went wrong."
Homer,All we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage Mir.
Homer,No.
Homer,Hike.
Homer,"Oh, I shoulda punted. Turn it off! Turn it off!"
Homer,"Stupid movies. Who invented these dumb things anyway? Was it you, Bart?"
Homer,"No one man can do all that. You're a liar, honey. A dirty, rotten liar."
Homer,"Really? A restaurant? Well, now I don't know what to think."
Homer,"Cut it out, boy!"
Homer,Reading about this Edison character. They won't let me in the big people library downtown. There was some unpleasantness. I can never go back.
Homer,"Ooh, look at all the inventions Edison came up with. The stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. And look at him dance."
Homer,De de de de de.
Homer,"And these Hardy Boys books are great, too. This one is about smugglers."
Homer,"No, not this one. ""The Smugglers of Pirate Cove."" It's about pirates."
Homer,I think it's pretty obvious that I am.
Homer,Go school!
Homer,Not the way I quit. Ooh-who.
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, Lenny. But here's one that's even more spellbinding. Once upon a time there was a man named Thomas Edison. And he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph..."
Homer,"... And he was a firm believer in Fletcherism, and he played the organ, and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh, and his middle name was Alva. And he never, ever, ever wore pajamas. And..."
Homer,"Well, I remember where Edison worked. It was Menlo Park. That's where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and..."
Homer,That's boring. You're boring everybody. Quit boring everyone!
Homer,... And then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead. Some kind of scary telephone I guess. Or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell.
Homer,"Ohh, that's where you're wrong, Marge. He was a shameless self-promoter."
Homer,"Marge, that's it! That's why I haven't done anything with my life! I need to be more like Thomas Edison!"
Homer,And I'm starting right now. No more lousy pajamas!
Homer,"From this day forward, I am an inventor!"
Homer,"Well, I quit my job just like you said to."
Homer,"Yes, you did. I remember your exact words. You said I should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house."
Homer,"At my age Edison had already invented 203 things. Ohh, I've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him."
Homer,Let's see now... inventions... inventions...
Homer,"What? Eh. Eh. Let me handle the creative end of this, Marge. You don't understand how the creative mind works like I do."
Homer,"You look at this table and what do you see? Just a table. Now, a creative person, like me, looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables."
Homer,My files!
Homer,"Uh, this isn't working. I've got to try a different approach."
Homer,Yes. Thomas Edison smoked several cigars a day.
Homer,Shutup.
Homer,"As long as you're here annoying me, let's have a brainstorming session. Now, here's how it works: Lisa, you say one thing, then Bart, you say another. Just toss out things and I'll use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,"A-- Wait a minute! These aren't exciting new products! You're not even trying. Okay, that's it. Both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves."
Homer,I don't see why not. They're my kids. I own 'em.
Homer,"Okay, we own 'em."
Homer,"Ohhh, it's no use. I can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community."
Homer,You stay here and guard the sandwich.
Homer,"Look, I just want to know how to invent things. Tell me."
Homer,You mean like an electric blanketmobile?
Homer,Hamburger earmuffs!
Homer,"Thanks, sucker!"
Homer,"Okay, I have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind."
Homer,"First, my All-Purpose Electric Hammer. ""For all your pounding needs."""
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Probably needs to be more powerful.
Homer,"Now, here's my ""Everything's Okay"" Alarm."
Homer,This will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay.
Homer,It can't be turned off.
Homer,"But it does break easily. Now this next one's for the ladies. How many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting, only to realize you're not wearing makeup?"
Homer,"That's why I invented this revolutionary makeup gun. It's for the woman who only has four-fifths of a second to get ready. Close your eyes, Marge."
Homer,And now you're ready for a night on the town.
Homer,"Eh. Oh. Okay, this time try to keep your nostrils closed."
Homer,"Oh, look what you did. Now I have to get my cold cream gun."
Homer,Women will like what I tell them to like. Now here's something for everyone.
Homer,"In the olden times, if you were watching TV and nature called, you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom. It was the hardest thing in the world to do. But now, with the Lazy Man Reclining Toilet Chair, you can just lean back and let 'er rip."
Homer,"Sure! Believe me, every man in America will want to have one."
Homer,Yes?
Homer,Yes? Yes? Yes?
Homer,What?
Homer,But this is the best I could do. I guess I'm no better at being Thomas Edison than I was at being Homer Simpson.
Homer,"All week, my life long dream was to be the next Thomas Edison, but now it's over. I guess I'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father."
Homer,"Oh, that. I stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause I kept tipping over when I was trying to invent stuff."
Homer,Really? You think it's a good idea?
Homer,I did it! I'm gonna be rich!
Homer,"Look, Mr. Edison, I did it. I'm an inventor! And I owe it all to you."
Homer,"See? It's just a regular chair, but I attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kinda like the ones on the back of your..."
Homer,AWDAMMIT!
Homer,"I thought I had a great idea, but I must've seen it on this poster."
Homer,It's not? Maybe he never told anyone about it.
Homer,That chair might be the only one he made.
Homer,"So, we've got to go to the Edison Museum and smash it! Then I'll be an inventor!"
Homer,"Aw, to hell with him!"
Homer,Taking-Bart-across-state-lines-Back-soon.
Homer,I borrowed your wallet!
Homer,"Oh, son, you're young and headstrong, just like Thomas Edison, Jr. You know, he started a mushroom farm, and an auto parts company, and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company. Oh, and later, he raised turkeys. That was on his turkey farm."
Homer,Now let's take care of business.
Homer,"Outta the way. This is one invention you're not getting credit for, you inspiration hog!"
Homer,"Invent your way out of this, Edison."
Homer,"Look, son. Edison was just like me."
Homer,No! We both lived in another man's shadow. This old-timey nerd and I have suffered the same frustration and heartache.
Homer,"We're not rivals. We're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. I can't destroy your work, my friend."
Homer,"No, but we'll stop off at the da Vinci Museum on the way home..."
Homer,"Oh. Well then, we'll take it out on Eli Whitney."
Homer,Yay! / All right! / Woo-hoo! /
Homer,That's my Tommy.
Homer,Let's just say I'm sitting in the right chair.
Homer,"Mail call! Gather 'round, everyone!"
Homer,"All right. One for ""resident""..."
Homer,"Well, that's it."
Homer,I needed my power fix.
Homer,"Yeah, quit stalling, Marge. We want our reward."
Homer,"Man, it feels good to get out of that car. Ooo, go-carts! C'mon everybody, let's go."
Homer,"Look at me, Bart! I'm driving!"
Homer,Stand back and watch the pro.
Homer,Nah. They mess up my hair.
Homer,Ooh. Ball one.
Homer,Ball two. This Bozo's gonna walk me.
Homer,Hey!
Homer,"You're going down, you--"
Homer,Oh! Oh! Why you-- Hey you-- You better-- I'm gonna-- If you k--
Homer,I rolled up all the socks.
Homer,What's next?
Homer,All right.
Homer,I hate folding sheets.
Homer,"Well, whatever it is, it's a two-man job. Where's Bart?"
Homer,"It's okay, Marge. I'll get him. BA-ART!"
Homer,MILHOUSE!
Homer,TELL BART TO COME HOME!
Homer,WHO'S NELSON?
Homer,"All right, young lady. I want you to march yourself directly to the Kwik-E-Mart and get me some chips and a beer."
Homer,"And get a little something for yourself, sweetheart."
Homer,I'unno. Drug lab?
Homer,"Or reading comic books. What am I, Kreskin? You tell me what he's doing."
Homer,"Oh, man. This is the most exciting thing I've seen since Haley's Comet collided with the moon!"
Homer,Sure it didn't.
Homer,"Ooo, how 'bout cherry this time? And would it kill you to make some coffee?"
Homer,Why is this taking so long? Bart was born in about five minutes.
Homer,"Really? Well, the time just flew by, didn't it?"
Homer,I see a horn!
Homer,"Aww... Ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur."
Homer,That is one vicious baby bird.
Homer,Enough bickering. I know how to settle this.
Homer,"If anyone wants me, I'll be eating alone in the basement."
Homer,Stupid cards.
Homer,"I'm proud of you, boy. Mmmm, loganberry."
Homer,The chair? How come they only do crucifixions during sweeps?
Homer,"Woo hoo! Marge, they found a donor! I'm saved!"
Homer,"This is legal, right?"
Homer,Who wants to see their sexy new daddy?
Homer,"Later, chickie-pie."
Homer,You sent me to the chair.
Homer,"I know you are, but what am I?"
Homer,"It's hammer time, Snitchy."
Homer,"Oh, my God!"
Homer,"Shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. I'm gonna, like, totally waste you."
Homer,Yoink.
Homer,Don't worry. I'll protect you... Little dude.
Homer,There. Now no murderers can get in... or out.
Homer,You are sooo dead.
Homer,"Come here, you little--"
Homer,"Daddy would like a word with you, Barty!"
Homer,But I look so youthful and hunky.
Homer,The kid's gotta die.
Homer,But I love my son.
Homer,More than a lush head of hair?
Homer,Don't make me choose!
Homer,Nooooo!
Homer,"I love you, son."
Homer,"I'll show you, hair!"
Homer,Idiot?! Why you... little...
Homer,... Show you...
Homer,... I'll Kill you!
Homer,"It wasn't me, it was the hair!"
Homer,Going where?
Homer,Mama took those batteries / She took 'em away / Mama took those batteries / Size double A...
Homer,Ooh. How are Bart and Lisa gonna get out of this one?
Homer,Bor-ing.
Homer,"Huh? Oh, okay... Let's see... ""pause,"" ""three,"" no ""fa-fa""..."
Homer,Hee hee hee hee. Look how cute they are.
Homer,Look at him go.
Homer,Ohh... Ahh...
Homer,I just lost my appetite.
Homer,"Wait, mine came back."
Homer,I know how to cheer you up.
Homer,"This little piggy went to Kwik-E-Mart, this little piggy went nuts, this little piggy went surfing, and this little piggy went--"
Homer,Ooh!
Homer,"Look, Marge! Maggie lost her baby legs!"
Homer,All right. I got it. Come on. Get... off the...
Homer,"Bad baby! Oh, she's entering the terrible twos, all right."
Homer,"Is there anything you can prescribe, doctor?"
Homer,"Hello-- Oh, great. Mormons."
Homer,Huh? What are you talking about?
Homer,You intergalactic hussy! How could you?! Was he better than me?
Homer,"Well, we can't compete with that, but--"
Homer,"It made me angry, Jerry. Angry and tired."
Homer,"One-eyed, two-timing ! I'm gonna !"
Homer,"C'mon, Maggie. Let's go home."
Homer,"Oh, I was having the most wonderful dream. I had a hat, and a tie with no pants on."
Homer,I promise you kids lots of things. That's what makes me such a good father.
Homer,"No, that would make me a great father."
Homer,"Aw, four A.M. Now I'll never get back to..."
Homer,"""Magilla Gorilla, gorilla for sale..."" Hey, you shouldn'ta oughta taken my banana, Mr. Peebles."
Homer,"Screw this. Hang on, everyone. We're takin' the ol' Simpson shortcut."
Homer,"So long, suckers!"
Homer,"Eat my dust, suckers!"
Homer,"Mmmm. Ugh, pesticides! Carbomate, if I'm not mistaken. Yep, Carbomate."
Homer,I see it.
Homer,"Well, way out in the sticks like this, it could only be hillbillies."
Homer,Lower! Lower!
Homer,"Yep. That's where they cook up their ""vittles."""
Homer,"Okay, remember where we parked."
Homer,"Oh yeah, couldn't put it down."
Homer,"C'mon boy, let's get me a six-pack."
Homer,"Ohhh, that sounds like a wager to me."
Homer,Life jackets?
Homer,Tow rope?
Homer,Skier?
Homer,Here we go!
Homer,"Ooh, look at it go."
Homer,"Faster, Marge! Faster! The snapping turtles are massing!"
Homer,"Heads up. Comin' through. Look out! Hey, volley ball. Can I play later? Hi, Apu."
Homer,Higher!
Homer,"Bye-bye, fishies! Higher! Higherrr!"
Homer,"I'm soaring! Soaring majestically like a candy wrapper caught in an updraft! Higher, Marge! Higher!"
Homer,"Higher, I say! I want to soar higher than any man has ever soared! I want to look down on the clouds with contempt! I want to sneer at God's creation and spit on his -- uh-oh."
Homer,"Oh, this is not good."
Homer,"Aw, nuts."
Homer,"What? Oh, already?"
Homer,"Sorry, lady. I know you. You're Kim Basinger"
Homer,"Ohhh my God, I am such a huge, huge fan of yours, Miss Basinger."
Homer,"Well, I am a married man..."
Homer,Billy Baldwin!
Homer,"So, what are you two kids doin' in my neck of the woods?"
Homer,Wait! Tell me over breakfast. Who's for pancakes?
Homer,"Oh, I don't want to be a bother. Anyway, what are you two big Hollywood stars doing in good ol' Springfield?"
Homer,"Oh, why didn't you move to, sayyy... Bethesda?"
Homer,"Yeah, tell you the truth, I'm not even sure."
Homer,"A gallon of wheat grass juice, a five pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc, and a couple-a pairs of $600 sunglasses."
Homer,You shouldn't have to survive on dry crumbly muffins from... the Gersh Agency. You should let me do your shopping. I know where I can get you some great muffins.
Homer,"Okay, fine. But I could do all kinds of stuff for you. I noticed that skylight in your bedroom's broken."
Homer,"Please, Homer. C'mon, if you let me hang around a while, I can do all kinds of stuff for ya."
Homer,"Yeah, you owe me that much."
Homer,Absolutely. If you promise to keep mine.
Homer,I can't read.
Homer,I recognized the logo.
Homer,Nowhere famous.
Homer,Gersh Agency.
Homer,"Apu, I'm about to purchase some weird and fruity items, and I don't want any guff. First of all, I'll need the following mushrooms: portobello --"
Homer,Porcini --
Homer,Chanterelle --
Homer,AAAnd Shiitake.
Homer,"Nothing, nothing. I'm just broadening my horizons. Uh, by the way, do you have extra-wide bumper stickers for a Humvee?"
Homer,"Ooo, me-ow."
Homer,I'll get it! I'll get it!
Homer,Yes?
Homer,Ron Howard?!
Homer,Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger?!
Homer,"Really? You giant stars consider me a friend? Well, for the first time in my life I feel like I'm somebody. Ronny, are you also my close friend?"
Homer,It's called a Lawnmower. I invented it. You want one?
Homer,Sure. We'll all stay.
Homer,I'll do that! You go upstairs and have a beer.
Homer,Kent Brockman. Please.
Homer,"Well, you know me. I love animals. Beef, chicken, veal... if you're not part of the solution, Marge, you're part of the problem."
Homer,Imagine Films.
Homer,"A, uh... division of, um... Homer-Co."
Homer,"And lift, and strain, and hy-per-extend, keep those knees rigid, jerk that lower back..."
Homer,"That's right, force it. Whip that neck."
Homer,"Oh, there's that movie script I wrote. Where did you find it?"
Homer,"The important thing is, it's got the perfect part for you. Either one of you. It's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason. Ron Howard's attached to direct."
Homer,"Well, he expressed an interest."
Homer,Did too!
Homer,You lie!
Homer,So you're saying you don't want to star in my movie?
Homer,"Well, if Alec is out, I'm out too. You're on your own, Potsie."
Homer,I might have.
Homer,"Oh, I can't. I promised I wouldn't."
Homer,Who the hell are you?
Homer,"All right, I'm gonna let you guys in on something. But you've got to keep it much more secret than I did."
Homer,Unbelievable?
Homer,"Nothing, nothing. Good hustle."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"I'm looking at you, Horshak."
Homer,"Okay, okay, it was me. I'm sorry I blew your secret. But you don't know what it's like to be a nobody. I just wanted to bask in your reflected glory. Reflected glory!"
Homer,But where will I bask?
Homer,"Come on, Ron, we're not wanted here."
Homer,"All right, I'll go. But the next time you want someone to remind you which brother is which, or smell your hair while you're sleeping, just remember, old Homer won't be here anymore."
Homer,"Oh, how could Alec and Kim just cut me out of their lives?"
Homer,"When Kim makes a Manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. And would it kill you to put some fennel in it?"
Homer,"Oh, it was so great. I didn't have to fake it with them. I was actually excited to hear about their day."
Homer,Was it the dog from the Beethoven movies?
Homer,Our dog isn't famous. And you kids aren't exactly John and Joan Cusack. And you. You couldn't open a movie if your life depended on it. I'm about ready to ankle this family.
Homer,See? It's like we don't even speak the same language anymore. The only one who understands me is that guy who married Martha Raye.
Homer,"Hmmm... She may not be famous, but she's right. Those big shot stars used me up and spit me out. I did their laundry, got their pictures developed, took their garbage to the dump... And I've still got a car full of their crap. Crap, eh...?"
Homer,Attention starstruck fools!
Homer,Step right up and see the world's greatest mobile collection of Alec-and-Ron-and-Kim-arabilia.
Homer,"Only 5, no wait 10 dollars. You heard right, 20 dollars."
Homer,"That's right, Mister Tough Guy can't handle a little penicillin. Oh, and look at this. We can't even pay our bills and they're drinking Royal Crown Cola."
Homer,"Oh, yeah? What have they ever done for you? When was the last time Barbra Streisand cleaned out your garage? And when it's time to do the dishes, where's Ray Bolger? I'll tell ya. Ray Bolger is lookin' out for Ray Bolger!"
Homer,Why you little--!
Homer,"Ooh, look at me! I'm Kim Basinger, the big movie star! I'm so beautiful! I think I'm so great! I'm too important to take Homer to the Oscars."
Homer,Gotta-go-thank-you-for-supporting-the-Museum-of-Hollywood-Jerks.
Homer,"Oh, I'll never outrun them in a museum!"
Homer,No!
Homer,"Oh, God."
Homer,"Okay, I'll stop."
Homer,"Yes, I do."
Homer,"I believe that famous people have a debt to everyone. If celebrities didn't want people pawing through their garbage and saying they're gay, they shouldn't have tried to express themselves creatively."
Homer,"In closing, you people must realize that the public owns you for life. And when you're dead, you'll all be in commercials, dancing with vacuum cleaners. Thank you, Your Honor."
Homer,"Well, I'll always have my crank calls. Hello, old lady from ""Titanic""? You stink!"
Homer,"All righty, I'll just-- You stinkin' g--"
Homer,"But with college behind us, we'll need careers. And good ones."
Homer,"Slow down, fellas. I've got a way we can keep our legs, and still have a bright future."
Homer,"Oh, am I?"
Homer,It's the job of tomorrow... today!
Homer,"Well, that settles it. For all those reasons and more, let us choose an electrifying career in... Line."
Homer,Nuclear power.
Homer,"Pretty good, huh?"
Homer,"Well, there were script problems from day one."
Homer,"That was the problem. The important thing is, after all these years of paying my dues, I'm finally getting some decent parts."
Homer,"I didn't choose to be a gifted actor, Marge. It chose me. I'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. Now help me make up some phony credits."
Homer,Good. Good.
Homer,"You know... I have no idea. Hey, Dad. What does the ""J"" stand for?"
Homer,But I can't ask Mom. She's on the run from the law.
Homer,No! Homer Simpson does not lie twice on the same form. He never has and he never will.
Homer,"Yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies. The point is, I'm a grown man, and I deserve a middle name."
Homer,Great. I'll go shoot myself for bringing this up.
Homer,"Wow, look at this place. There's a pond for skinny dippin', a tire for skinny swingin'... I can actually feel the good vibrations."
Homer,Oww... ch.
Homer,You went to Woodstock?
Homer,"Lather, rinse, and repeat. Always repeat."
Homer,"Wow, I could have lived like that?"
Homer,"Ohh, my mother painted that for me?"
Homer,"Oh, my God! My middle name is right behind that shrub. I'll finally know what ""J"" stands for! From this moment forth, I will be known as Homer...Jay Simpson. It's so beautiful. What a magical gift for my mother to leave me."
Homer,I'll treasure this poncho forever.
Homer,"My head full of long, luxurious, hippie hair. I'll do it!"
Homer,"I'm gonna be a hippie, just like Mom wanted. I'm gonna let my spirit soar and love all of God's creatures!"
Homer,"Get off, you stupid dog!"
Homer,"Okay, if I'm gonna be a real hippie, I have to learn from the master, Mr. Bob ""flower child"" Hope."
Homer,Bummer... love-in... Dean Rusk... By George I've got it!
Homer,"Your potato? You can't like own a potato, man. It's one of Mother Earth's creatures."
Homer,"No way, narc. Bodily functions are a natural thing."
Homer,"Why do you have to turn everything into one big plastic hassle? Marge, you've got too many hang-ups. Like the whole shaving trip. C'mon, I want to see those legs all furry and gross."
Homer,"Well, at least lose the bra. Free the ""Springfield Two,"" Marge! Free the ""Springfield Two!"""
Homer,"C'mon, Maude. The human wang is a beautiful thing."
Homer,"Okay, okay. Narc."
Homer,Heads up!
Homer,Right on.
Homer,"That was cool. Think I'll stick around. We've got everything we need right here. Good times, sunshine, free love..."
Homer,Work!? But you're hippies!
Homer,What is this place?
Homer,"Profits, profits, profits! What kinda hippies are you? Peter Fonda must be spinning in his grave."
Homer,"Oh, yeah? When's the last time you freaked out the establishment? You guys are total sellouts."
Homer,"Look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out. C'mon, where's your freak bus?"
Homer,A Saturn?
Homer,Fine. I guess the juice business is more important than the ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die for.
Homer,Now your freak flag's flying! Let the freak-out begin! Woo hoo!
Homer,Ohh... we're never gonna freak anybody out with this music. I brought something from my personal stash that'll blow some minds.
Homer,"Hey square, expand your mind! The doors of perception are open for business."
Homer,"Never fear, the cosmic fool is here to blow the lid off your conformist, button-down world!"
Homer,"Hi, Marge. We're freaking out squares!"
Homer,"What's in your brand new bag, mama?"
Homer,Marge. Not in front of the hippies.
Homer,Hear ye! Hear ye! The intergalactic jester proclaims this conformity factory closed!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"No, no, no. Marge was definitely freaked out."
Homer,"Uh. Pretty, uh, freaky, huh?"
Homer,I'm sensing some negative vibes here. But I promise tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.
Homer,"Yes, b-b-but the poncho..."
Homer,B-b-but the poncho...
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Aww, it was sweet of those guys to blame an oaf, but really it was my fault. I just don't have the discipline to be a hippie."
Homer,Perhaps in time.
Homer,"Aww, you're just saying that."
Homer,"Well, I do walk through pretty much anything... Ohh, you kids are sweet."
Homer,That's it! Somehow!
Homer,"Sleep gentle hippies, sleep. Let old Homer Jay set things right."
Homer,"Good morning, Starshine. Seth."
Homer,"I picked 'em, juiced 'em, and delivered 'em to every store in town. Your business is saved!"
Homer,Heh. That's what I thought at first. But then I found the other garden behind the barn -- the one with the camouflage netting.
Homer,"Well, now the whole town can benefit from their nutrients!"
Homer,"Not so fast, Pig! We're making a stand. A freaky stand! You can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!"
Homer,"Seth, Munchie, they can destroy our bodies and our ponchos, but they can never silence our song of protest. ""UPTOWN GIRL / SHE'S BEEN LIVING IN HER WHITE-BREAD WORLD..."" Come on, guys... UPTOWN GIRL..."
Homer,"Look at yourselves, pointing guns at your fellow man."
Homer,"Hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free. Yes, the sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since extinguished, but its ideals live on."
Homer,Freedom...
Homer,Love...
Homer,And peace.
Homer,Can't you just prune some of the leaves so I can watch TV?
Homer,That's no fun.
Homer,Don't make me come up there!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Hang in there, son. I'm taking us out for our traditional Sunday brunch."
Homer,"He zinged you, Marge."
Homer,Brunch is served!
Homer,"Why? We're following the rules -- if it has a toothpick in it, it's free."
Homer,"Cherry Garcia... Honey Bono... Desmond Tutti Fruitti... Lisa, help Daddy find some normal flavors."
Homer,"Nooo, nothing made of dead guys. What's in the back?"
Homer,Hurry up. My hands are getting cold.
Homer,Sherbet Hoover?
Homer,Ooooh.
Homer,"Hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? Oh, I can't afford that."
Homer,Unless...
Homer,"I tell ya, I'm a financial genius. I buy an eight-dollar lobster, fatten it into an eighty-dollar lobster, and eat the profits."
Homer,I'm way ahead of you.
Homer,Hold on. I'm still fine-tuning.
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Perfect.
Homer,No problem. I picked some up at the store.
Homer,Nothing's too good for my one and only.
Homer,"Eat, eat! You're nothing but skin and bones."
Homer,"Okay, together, we weigh three hundred pounds. According to my driver's license, I weigh 140 pounds."
Homer,"That means that you weigh... One hundred and sixty pounds! Oh-ho-ho, you're doin' great!"
Homer,"Good news, my delicious friend! You're going to be a free-range lobster."
Homer,"C'mon, boy, dig in. They'll give you a big, strong thorax."
Homer,"Aw, look at him cower, just like the boy. I can't stay mad at such a helpless little mammal."
Homer,"Oh, I'm gonna get you for that, you little scamp!"
Homer,"Take that, Pinchy."
Homer,"Well, I guess this is it, ol' pal. This is your big day."
Homer,Uh...
Homer,Okay...
Homer,"But Marge, look at the little guy!"
Homer,"Feel that, Marge? He likes you!"
Homer,And now for the main course...
Homer,Steamed Maine cabbages!
Homer,We're not eating Mr. Pinchy. He's part of the family now.
Homer,"Pinchy, I made you some risotto."
Homer,"What's your problem, Veggie? You don't even eat lobster."
Homer,"Aren't you proud of your big sister, Mr. Pinchy? Hmm? Hmm?"
Homer,That's my girl!
Homer,"Relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. Enjoy your day at the beach! Ooh, look."
Homer,Here's a little playmate for you.
Homer,"Hey, you don't have to take that from no punk-ass crab. What's wrong with you?"
Homer,Wooo!!
Homer,"Sorry, Marge. Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. But don't worry. I put him in a nice hot bath."
Homer,Yeah... Pinchy?... Pinchy?!... Oh... Pinchy!!!
Homer,"Oh, man, that's good. Pass the butter."
Homer,"Uh-huh. Pinchy would have wanted it this way. My dear, sweet Pinchy. No more pain where you are now, boy."
Homer,"Oh God, that's tasty. I wish Pinchy were here to enjoy this. Ohhh, Pinchy!"
Homer,"Hey, I'm trying to drive here!"
Homer,Uh-oh. Tape must have fallen off.
Homer,"There, problem solved."
Homer,"Relax, she just needs a little lovin'."
Homer,"Come on, come on, come on. Start, damn you. Start!"
Homer,Two hours? Why'd they build this ghost town so far away?
Homer,"It's because they're stupid, that's why. That's why everybody does everything."
Homer,Three minutes?
Homer,Do we have to listen to you?
Homer,I'm done.
Homer,"Hey robot, get your fat, metal ass down here!"
Homer,"Let's see. One, two, three... six whiskeys!"
Homer,Duh.
Homer,"What the heck is this, a tea party? Somebody kill somebody!"
Homer,"But it's funny, Marge. The guy's sick."
Homer,"Oh, we've gotta get home. I don't wanna miss, ""Inside the Actor's Studio."" Tonight it's F. Murray Abraham."
Homer,F. Murray Abraham.
Homer,Can't stop now. We're making great time.
Homer,"What are you, an animal?"
Homer,"Whoever keeps saying ""please stop"" back there, better quit it."
Homer,"Wow, get a load of that toilet."
Homer,"We're almost home, Dad. Only a couple more times over the horizon."
Homer,You just sit back and relax. I'm not gonna let anything happen to my old dad.
Homer,"Yep, that's what happens when you get older. It's one of those natural things. Beautiful in its way."
Homer,"Excuse me, doctor. I think I know a little something about medicine..."
Homer,So... you're saying I don't need a new muffler?
Homer,"Oh, I blame myself for this."
Homer,"C'mon, Doc. There's gotta be something I can do to help my dad."
Homer,"A kidney? Okay, fine."
Homer,"I said ""fine."" What is it about the word ""sure"" you don't understand?"
Homer,"Pork chops, sloppy joes, hot dogs, and pork chops?"
Homer,"Well now that's what I always thought, but somehow..."
Homer,"""Apes-A-Poppin'!"" Oooh, the airline version!"
Homer,Nothing's too good for me.
Homer,"Ahhh. I'm the luckiest man in the world, now that Lou Gehrig's dead."
Homer,"It's not an operation, Moe. The doctor says it's just a procedure."
Homer,Really? You think it's dangerous?
Homer,Procedure. Deadly procedure.
Homer,Now you're just tryin' to scare me.
Homer,But I don't want that.
Homer,"Yeah, I guess."
Homer,"Well, actually I-- Hey! Quit harvesting me with your eyes!"
Homer,"Marge, I've been thinking. What if, instead of donating one of my old, worn-out kidneys, I gave Grampa that artificial kidney I invented?"
Homer,"But I don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. Why didn't somebody tell me what I was volunteering for? This is everybody's fault but mine."
Homer,I owe Dad so much. Those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word.
Homer,"You're right, Marge. I'll do it. But if I die during the operation, will you do one thing for me?"
Homer,Blow up the hospital.
Homer,That's my girl.
Homer,Liability waiver?
Homer,"Yeah, but all these skulls and crossbones on here... I don't usually sign stuff like that."
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"I love you, Dad."
Homer,I'm not worthy to live among civilized people.
Homer,Even those guys look too civilized for me.
Homer,I could live at sea! The sea forgives all. Not like those mean old mountains. I hate them so much.
Homer,Hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.
Homer,"Uh, excuse me, I'm fleeing in shame and I'd like to look my best."
Homer,"Um, can I be a mate on your ship? Preferably First Mate."
Homer,"Oh, I like taffy, but I don't deserve taffy."
Homer,A tramp steamer! That's perfect!
Homer,"Oh, I'd like to apply for a job. Any job. If you don't have a captain, I could be that."
Homer,I've been on that one. The taffy shop.
Homer,"The name on the back says ""Honeybunch."""
Homer,"Well, actually, you did..."
Homer,"Say, who are you guys?"
Homer,"H-Heyy, let me off this thing."
Homer,Whew.
Homer,Forget what?
Homer,"Well, back on land, my name was Homer Simpson. And I guess it is here, too. I promised my Dad one of my kidneys, but I chickened out at the last minute and left him on his deathbed."
Homer,"Well, yeah, I know..."
Homer,That's the last time I trust the strangest people on earth.
Homer,Even the sea won't forgive me.
Homer,"Oh, I wish I had that kind of relationship with my father... or my kids. Well, I guess it's up to me to take the first step."
Homer,"All right, this is it. No more living in shame. I'm going to show my family the kind of man I really am."
Homer,"All right, I'm gonna..."
Homer,"No you're not, Dad."
Homer,"I'm sorry, Dad. The way I behaved was shameful. I guess fear made me run away. But love made me come back."
Homer,"Boy, that..."
Homer,Ow!
Homer,"I'm sorry I ran off again. Oh, I guess Dad must be dead by now. When I get better, and after I've built those shelves for the kitchen, we'll visit his grave..."
Homer,It's a miracle! You recovered!
Homer,What? What? Hey!
Homer,You butchers! Give it back! Gimme that! Gim--
Homer,"Don't you dance out that door you... I'll get my kidney back, old man! You have to sleep sometime!"
Homer,"Yeah, I guess you're right. Gimme a hug."
Homer,I don't need two kidneys. I have everything I need right here...
Homer,Hmmm...
Homer,"Yesss, tickling."
Homer,"Well, I'd rather get a message than see another lousy commercial."
Homer,"Well, beats work."
Homer,Are you sure this is the sci-fi convention? It's full of nerds.
Homer,Nooooooooooo!
Homer,You stupid nerds! He's trying to save you money on long distance!
Homer,Neeerrrds!
Homer,Get out of there!
Homer,"Mr. Hamill, Mr. Mayor, come on!"
Homer,Homer Simpson -- nerd buster. And I'm gettin' you out of here!
Homer,Never!
Homer,Follow me.
Homer,"Oh, how was I supposed to know it's not a real spaceship?"
Homer,Forget Maggie! She's gone!
Homer,"Well, it's all-- Hey, I thought you twisted your ankle."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"I said, ""woo hoo."""
Homer,Even during Ramadan?
Homer,Wha?
Homer,Nooo!
Homer,Clear!
Homer,The pig is in the poke.
Homer,"Look out, Marge! Cat!"
Homer,Hold it! What's your clearance?
Homer,Access denied.
Homer,They'll be fine in half an hour.
Homer,"Hmm, still half an hour till dinner. Oh, well..."
Homer,"It's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir."
Homer,Semi-imported. Keep 'em comin'.
Homer,"... And after Moe's, we went to Krustyburger and the mayor got some more change, and I ordered a double double, but they gave me the double double double double. And then Apu gave the Mayor lots of change for..."
Homer,"Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works. Sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time."
Homer,"So, how'd you get the nickname ""Legs""?"
Homer,"Oooh, mini-cannoli!"
Homer,Hey! I called that! I saw it first! Come back here!
Homer,Milking room? I hope you cows are decent.
Homer,Oh! Crap on a crutch!
Homer,They're milking rats! Milk-ing rats!
Homer,"Bart, no!"
Homer,"Oh, get that away from me!"
Homer,"Kids, I don't want you drinking any more milk. Ever."
Homer,Go nuts.
Homer,You... monster! How could you do that to the children?!
Homer,"And to think, I respected you! And defended you! You wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!"
Homer,"Okay, we'll call it even."
Homer,"Oh my God, I killed the mayor. All right, stay calm. I'll just use the body to stage an elaborate farce, à la ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" and..."
Homer,His corpse is climbing the building!
Homer,A-- Wait a second. I'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools.
Homer,"You're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the business. Now promise, or I'll let you fall to your death."
Homer,Shake on it?
Homer,"Relax, you're in good hands. Now come on, I'll pull you up."
Homer,"Ooh, the Mafia guy's all mad. Oh, what are you gonna do? Call your Godfather? Huh? Ooh, Godfather. Break it down!"
Homer,"Oh, don't worry about that, boy. He's already out on bail. Well, I'm off to work."
Homer,"It's my duty, Marge. Besides, those mobsters don't scare me. Bart, would you go start Daddy's car?"
Homer,What? There's nothing to worry about.
Homer,"All right, fine. I'll take a cab."
Homer,"Oh, I get it. You're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya?"
Homer,"You've gotta snap out of this funk, Mayor. I'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters."
Homer,"Uh, excuse me..."
Homer,Do you have a table for the mayor?
Homer,Why do you talk that way?
Homer,"Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, what's-his-name... Fat Tony?!"
Homer,"All right, Fat Tony. If it's trouble with Quimby you're after--"
Homer,"Mayor, Fat Tony asked me to give you this--"
Homer,Oh no. Wait... maybe I didn't do it right.
Homer,Nooooooooo!!!
Homer,Potatoes are clean. The poison must be in the steak.
Homer,"Yesss! Nobody messes with the mayor when Homer Simpson's on -- Aw, crap."
Homer,"That guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?"
Homer,"I think I saw him in ""Rent,"" or ""Stomp,"" or ""Clomp,"" or some piece of crap."
Homer,Look out!
Homer,Gimme that knife!
Homer,The force?!
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Oh, Fat Tony."
Homer,"Ohh, I'd say you were luminous, magnetic, incandescent."
Homer,Really? Would you say I was magnetic?
Homer,Aww...
Homer,Get out of the way you--
Homer,"Oh, I can explain that. You see..."
Homer,"Don Rickles zinged you, Marge."
Homer,"Eat my dust, dust!"
Homer,"Aaah, what's the rush? Might rain next week."
Homer,Really? You think I should get it washed?
Homer,"Hey, that's great."
Homer,Wuss rock?
Homer,"Ten dollars?! What is this, a car wash for millionaires?"
Homer,Hey! How did Churchy La Femme get half price?
Homer,Senior citizen? Flanders?
Homer,"Well, we'll see about that."
Homer,"I wouldn't do that, Reverend. You see, ""Saint Flanders"" is as crooked as you or me!"
Homer,"That's right, it's my sad duty to rat out this man for defrauding a car wash. How, you ask? With a phony senior discount card!"
Homer,Did you or did you not use a senior citizen discount card at said car wash?
Homer,Now I'm not a fancy big-city lawyer...
Homer,But it seems to me that a senior citizen has to be over 55. Isn't that so?
Homer,And you are how old?
Homer,You mean that one with the red paint?
Homer,"Geez, Flanders. You're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life."
Homer,"All right, Bart!"
Homer,Fire in the hole!
Homer,"Okay, no more gasoline."
Homer,Full power!
Homer,"You got that right. Throw on the mesquite, Bart!"
Homer,"Well, well, well. So flawless Flanders needs help from stinky-pants Simpson."
Homer,"Welly, welly, welly... Mr. Clean wants to hang with Dirty Dingus Magee."
Homer,"Wellity, wellity, wellity..."
Homer,Let's do it.
Homer,"Eh, the Missus will clean that up."
Homer,"First of all, I get five dollars a day plus expenses."
Homer,"And I'll need your signature... here, here, aaannnnd... initial here."
Homer,Well that's unfortunate. It really is.
Homer,Congratulations! Welcome to the Homer Simpson Program.
Homer,"One day soon I will come for you, and then the game will begin. Could be in the middle of the night. It could be when you least expect it. Or whatever's good for you. I don't care."
Homer,Gimme that!
Homer,That's your problem. You're living up here.
Homer,You gotta live down here.
Homer,"In the impulse zone. If you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. Like this."
Homer,We're going to break the bank at the Monty Burns Casino!
Homer,You mean Lisa?
Homer,"Oh yeah, right."
Homer,Then we're goin' to Las Vegas! Which is actually back in that direction.
Homer,"""Nobody's goin' to take my Ned / I'll teach him to have fu-un / Ooh, he's a Flanders machine..."""
Homer,"Relax, I called her from the gas station."
Homer,Sucker.
Homer,I don't think so.
Homer,I think you'll find escape is quite impossible.
Homer,Hey! Lance Murdock!
Homer,"He's a daredevil, Ned. He laughs at death."
Homer,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! Pick him!"
Homer,"Fine, I'll do it. Where do you want me?"
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure it out. This isn't rocket science."
Homer,Bo-ring.
Homer,"Hey Flanders, Don't spill my beer!"
Homer,"Okey-doke, let's hit the tables."
Homer,"Oh, I think someone just had his first taste of blood loss."
Homer,"Let's see... what's Marge's birthday? Barney is July fifteenth, same as Lassie's, so Marge's must be... fifty... oh, forget it. Flanders, what's your birthday?"
Homer,"Seven, eh?"
Homer,"Way to go, Flanders. The Bible's finally pulling its weight. Got any more holy numbers?"
Homer,One betting disk please. Watch and learn.
Homer,"Well, there you go. Now how 'bout a drink?"
Homer,"Oh, that. That can be treated with our good friend alcohol. You might want to write that down. Where the hell's your notebook?"
Homer,"Oh, never mind. Just pay attention."
Homer,"Slave girl? Oh, slave girl?"
Homer,Whuh?
Homer,"Oh, yeah. Two more of these, please."
Homer,"And for you, Ned?"
Homer,Welcome to my world.
Homer,The what now?
Homer,"Well, of course a-- Who are you?"
Homer,"Hey, smooth move, Flanders!"
Homer,Eeech.
Homer,"Okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay. Okay, you're saying that Ned and me married you two?"
Homer,"Ned, no! Think of your wives!"
Homer,"Wait a minute. This could be some kind of scam -- or possibly, scam-ola. We would remember if we got married."
Homer,"Ahh, precious memories."
Homer,What did you call me?
Homer,"Sure. Sock it to me, baby."
Homer,We are so dead.
Homer,"Ladies, we want to do the honorable thing. So breakfast is on us, with full waffle-bar privileges. But first, I'm afraid we have some bad news. The waffle bar is closed. I'm sorry. I'm so very--"
Homer,"But Ginger, honey, I am not the catch I appear to be."
Homer,"Are you sure? Oh, rats. No offense, Sweetie."
Homer,"Geez, I've never seen anyone so whipped so fast."
Homer,"I don't know, Flanders, having two wives could have its advantages."
Homer,"Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig..."
Homer,"I hear digging, but I don't hear chopping."
Homer,"Ooh, a friendly bee."
Homer,Ow!
Homer,"Ow, that sting hurt so much. We gotta get outta this, Ned."
Homer,"Blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the program. The program is rock solid. The program is sound."
Homer,"Oh, those awful women want their omelettes."
Homer,Ginger throws Ned a kiss.
Homer,A lion!
Homer,The Moody Blues!
Homer,What if we switched wives? Would that help?
Homer,Hel-lo. Our ticket to freedom.
Homer,"So long, su--"
Homer,"But Amber, I can change!"
Homer,"All right, let's get our stories straight for Marge and Maude. We were out buying them fabulous gifts..."
Homer,"Because we love them, Jackass."
Homer,"Anyhoo, we came out of Walmart, when suddenly one hundred spaceships..."
Homer,"You're right, you're right. Fifty spaceships, beamed us aboard. They gang-probed you, while I discovered an invention that blew their heads up and saved America."
Homer,Would you rather tell Maude the truth?
Homer,"Well, I only saw them from the back, 'cause they were so busy gang probing you."
Homer,"Hello, little birdie."
Homer,Ah!! Cover your eyes!
Homer,Boooo!
Homer,"Oh, stupid Isotopes. Hurry up and lose so we can get out of here!"
Homer,"Because, I loved them once and they broke my heart. Let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything."
Homer,Especially me.
Homer,I'm going to warm up the car.
Homer,And it sucked!
Homer,"""HITLER IS A JERK, MUSSOLINI..."""
Homer,NOW IT DOESN'T WORK.
Homer,"So, who won? The losers?"
Homer,Losers.
Homer,"You'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever happens."
Homer,What's the hubub? Did Moe finally blow his brains out?
Homer,Shut it off. They're losers.
Homer,Championship?
Homer,Wooooo! 'Topes ruuuule!
Homer,"Oh, it's a great team, Kent... never gave up hope... I want to thank Jesus... and say hi to my special lady Marge... We did it, baby! Wooooo! Woooooo!"
Homer,They lost? Those losers!
Homer,Woo! Not over! Wooooo!
Homer,Woo! Rumaki!
Homer,Isotoooopes! Wooo!
Homer,"Hey, a baseball field! Batter up!"
Homer,Touchdown!
Homer,Safe!
Homer,Whoop! Careful.
Homer,Last night?
Homer,"Hello, big Maggie."
Homer,Serves you little punks right. Maybe next time you'll think befo--
Homer,"Oh, my God! Look what those rotten kids did to my car!"
Homer,"That was cold-blooded, Marge."
Homer,"Well, if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them? Acting childish. Kidnapping. Child abuse..."
Homer,"Not until you're older, son."
Homer,"Kids, the carnival's in town for one night only! And they've got cotton candy and hats with feathers and there's no lines because all the stupid kids have curfew! So-- Oh, right. Sorry."
Homer,"Marge, kite."
Homer,"So, Marge, ready for another episode of ""Don't Go There""?"
Homer,"Okay, whatever takes my mind off my life."
Homer,"Well, turn something on. I'm starting to think."
Homer,Bo-ring. Go back to that infamy guy.
Homer,I have a problem.
Homer,"Well, at least they've already done me."
Homer,"Oh, I hope they don't reveal this is a comb-over."
Homer,"Speak for yourself! Bart, get down here! I'm gonna spank you back to the Stone Age!"
Homer,Perfect.
Homer,YEAH! / YOU'RE ONLY HERE 'CAUSE MARGE FORGOT HER PILL.
Homer,Oh yeah? What can you old people do to us?
Homer,Pfft. It wouldn't have made a difference.
Homer,"Wow, a Val-U-Qual coupon book!"
Homer,Let's see. Ten percent off carpet cleaning. Ten! Two pizzas for the price of one at Doughy's.
Homer,"Yeah, but there's two!"
Homer,"Oh, Marge. That's just a trick to get you in there so they can cure your foot pain."
Homer,"See ya, kids. Me and my Val-U-Qual book are gonna paint the town red... with savings! I'll start with a couple of pizzas, then a complimentary tango lesson and I'll cap it off with a smooth, refreshing colonic."
Homer,Do you like piña colonics / And getting caught in the rain...
Homer,Passing out in the ocean...
Homer,"Now this wheel balancing is free, right?"
Homer,They won't?
Homer,No.
Homer,Really?
Homer,"Oh, please, can't you let me slide this time?"
Homer,"No! Wait! This is all my fault! Oh, if I could only turn back the clock and buy four new tires..."
Homer,Six with the tip.
Homer,Stem lube. Even I didn't fall for that... Although winter is coming...
Homer,"Hey, I know you. We were in the same pyramid scheme."
Homer,Yeah. I'm gettin' tired of them pointing and laughing at us.
Homer,Football's so great.
Homer,Me? Nah. Unless there's a coupon for it. Nah.
Homer,Homer Simpson at the Super Bowl?
Homer,Me?!
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"It's a deal. Hey, Moe. Wanna come with me and Wally to the Super Bowl?"
Homer,"Yeah, they're good. But I wouldn't count out the... Denver Broncos ."
Homer,"C'mon, Lenny. I just need four more guys to fill my Super Bowl bus. Whaddaya say?"
Homer,C'mon!...
Homer,C'mon!
Homer,"Oh, c'mon!..."
Homer,"Yes! Now that Lenny's in, Carl will fall like a domino."
Homer,"Yeah, yeah. Do we have any pencils that work?"
Homer,"Yeah, it's a good group."
Homer,"Aw, thank God! Now we can stop holding it in."
Homer,"What is it, Rudy?"
Homer,"Hey, Troy Aikman!"
Homer,"'Scuse me, comin' through. Friends of Dan Marino."
Homer,"Okay, Dan. Fire away."
Homer,Woo hoo! Homer Simpson with the pick!
Homer,"Uh-oh. Lateral, to Bart!"
Homer,My spine.
Homer,"Scalping tickets to the Super Bowl. Have you no shame, sir? I should give you a royal caning."
Homer,"Aw, get lost, ya bloodsucking parasite. Wally and I have all the tickets we need."
Homer,Stop eating our tickets!
Homer,"Yes, if by ""crestfallen"" you mean ""kill us."" Listen, let me talk to them. Maybe I can smooth this over."
Homer,My friends...
Homer,"Please, my friends... Ow! All right, I'll get you into to the game!"
Homer,"Excuse me, Uh, Mr. Scalper, sir. Have I told you that I love you?"
Homer,"Okay, Moe. I believe you had me by the throat. Reverend Lovejoy was working the body..."
Homer,"Gentlemen, I have an idea."
Homer,Run!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,We can still make the kickoff!
Homer,Let us outta here!
Homer,"Oh, we're never gonna get out of... Psst, cleaning lady. Would you let us out of here?"
Homer,I didn't ask for your life story. Just give me the key.
Homer,"Man, that's gonna be some show."
Homer,Football!
Homer,You guys are following me? I was following Flanders.
Homer,In a minute.
Homer,"Hey, it's the beer copter!"
Homer,"Hit the road, Gramps. This is a private sky box."
Homer,The game! We're so close!
Homer,"Follow me, boys. We're finally going to the Sup... Ow!"
Homer,Y'ello...
Homer,"Hey, howyadoin'?"
Homer,"Well, it's about time."
Homer,"Ow! Oh! All right, Lovejoy! You're gonna get it."
Homer,But this might be my last chance to win one.
Homer,"Wally, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't."
Homer,What one?
Homer,Door?
Homer,Phone?
Homer,"Dog, cat?"
Homer,"Oh, I can't wait. Look, Marge, I had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place."
Homer,You're thinking of all the other years. This year's shows are classics.
Homer,"There's ""The Laughter Family."" That's animated. Networks like animation 'cause they don't have to pay the actors squat."
Homer,"Gee... I never thought I'd say this about a TV show, but this is kinda stupid. Hey, ""PoliceCops."" That sounds like a lethal combination."
Homer,Isn't bad? Tell me one thing mankind's ever done that's any better.
Homer,This is better.
Homer,He's named like my name!
Homer,Wow. They've captured my personality perfectly. Did you see the way Daddy caught that bullet?
Homer,"Don't confuse Daddy, Lisa."
Homer,"Y'ello... yes, this is the original Homer Simpson. Who's this?... The Debbie Pinson who was the homecoming queen at high school?... Yes, I'm still available."
Homer,"Marge, that was Debbie Pinson. DEB-BIE PIN-SON."
Homer,Local Man Has Same Name. A TV character has the same name as Springfield resident Homer Simpson.
Homer,And that's the end of that chapter.
Homer,All right. And what's the name?
Homer,Take it or leave it... Carl.
Homer,"Mmm, who knows? Maybe I'll have to foil an assassination, or stop a peace conference."
Homer,Yup. Right down to the scarf.
Homer,"Hey, what's going on? That guy's not Homer Simpson. He's fat and stupid."
Homer,"No, no, he can't be. I know, maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. Yeah, that's gotta be it."
Homer,Shutup! I'm not your clown! Don't diminish me!
Homer,"Gentlemen, I bid you--"
Homer,Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa!
Homer,I can't understand what happened. Why did they change Homer Simpson's character from cool to stupid?
Homer,That does it! There's only one thing I can do.
Homer,I wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these.
Homer,"Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show. Now if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about..."
Homer,"People are laughing at me, Marge. Let's get outta here. Forget the baby's medicine."
Homer,"Fine. I'll be in the car, driving home."
Homer,"Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's."
Homer,"C'mon, people. Enough is enough."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"The whole town's laughin' at me. Even that cat out there. Bart, kill that cat!"
Homer,And that big yellow flower.
Homer,"Hmmmm, I guess I could... But while I'm gone, keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there."
Homer,"Yeah. ""Bart."""
Homer,"Uh, so, I just want to know how come you made your Homer Simpson character so..."
Homer,It better have.
Homer,Who's Jeremy Piven?
Homer,PoliceCops.
Homer,"Yeah, but why does the Homer Simpson character have to be so stupid?"
Homer,I'm begging you. I'm a human being. Let me have my dignity back.
Homer,"Your honor, I'd like to sue the producers of ""PoliceCops"" for twenty million dollars for improper use of my name."
Homer,Then I'd like to legally change my name.
Homer,Any of these will be fine.
Homer,"Dynamic, isn't it?"
Homer,"That's the way Max Power is, Marge. Decisive, uncompromising, and rude."
Homer,"Yes, briefly."
Homer,"Oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off."
Homer,Nobody snuggles with Max Power. You strap yourself in and feel the G's.
Homer,"And it doesn't stop in the bedroom. Oh no, I'm taking charge. Kids, there's three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the Max Power way."
Homer,"Yeah, but faster."
Homer,"MAX POWER / HE'S THE MAN / WHOSE NAME YOU'D LOVE TO TOUCH / BUT YOU MUSTN'T TOUCH / HIS NAME SOUNDS GOOD IN YOUR EAR / BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT, YOU MUSTN'T FEAR / 'CAUSE HIS NAME CAN BE SAID BY ANYONE..."
Homer,You remembered my name!
Homer,Mr. Power.
Homer,So I want the monogram to read M-A-X P-O-W-
Homer,"Max Power doesn't abbreviate. Each letter is as important as the one that preceded it. Maybe more important. No, as important."
Homer,"And if you have enough room, add some exclamation points and a pirate flag."
Homer,Just takin' care of business.
Homer,"Homer Sim-- Uh, Max Power."
Homer,"Yeah, isn't it? I got it off a hair dryer."
Homer,"Yeah, but I usually have three or four."
Homer,Tie good. You like shirt?
Homer,"Marge, this is Thai food. From now on, I want it morning, noon and night."
Homer,When Trent Steel bought me some.
Homer,He's Max Power's oldest and dearest friend.
Homer,"Oh, I spit my gum in there."
Homer,"No way, this guy's a winner. He has a company that makes computers, or a computer that makes companies... Anyway, you wouldn't understand."
Homer,For all of us. Look.
Homer,"This is our chance to rub elbows with Springfield's young, hip power couples... Like me and Debbie Pinson."
Homer,"Get used to it, honey. From now on, we'll be spelling everything with letters."
Homer,Nah. Just park it.
Homer,And I counted the pennies in the ashtray.
Homer,Maarrge... President Clinton!
Homer,"Me, too. Let's sing the Cinderella song."
Homer,Uh-oh. Here comes Lorne Michaels. Pretend you don't see him.
Homer,"Anyway, Marge. Uh, how do you feel about the economy?"
Homer,"So I said ""if this is the house of pancakes, how come I can't eat the walls?"""
Homer,"Well, I spend a lot of time on the couch..."
Homer,"Hey, no problem."
Homer,"Woo, privilege!"
Homer,Whuh?!
Homer,Give something back? Boo! Get a haircut!
Homer,Somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up.
Homer,"Hey, stop shoving! I'm Max Power!"
Homer,"What's going on, Trent? Where are you taking me?"
Homer,"Oh, this is the worst party ever."
Homer,"Oh, Marge. I thought it would be fun to be on Springfield's ""A"" list, but these people are nuts."
Homer,Sure you can. Buncha no-good do-gooders.
Homer,"That's what I'm saying! See Marge, this guy gets it."
Homer,Tree-huggers...
Homer,"No, I just thought it was cute when you called him..."
Homer,I can't lose them!
Homer,Eep! Leave me alone! Go swab Begley. He likes it!
Homer,I'm free! Woo hoo!
Homer,Right after Happy Hour!
Homer,"So, Trent, where's the party bus headed now?"
Homer,What?
Homer,"Yes, I learned you've gotta be yourself. G'night, honey."
Homer,"Oh, I almost forgot. While I was at the courthouse, I had them change your name."
Homer,Chesty LaRue.
Homer,"Just try it for two weeks. If you're not completely satisfied, you can be Busty St. Claire."
Homer,Fine. Hooty McBoob it is.
Homer,"Sleep tight, Hooty."
Homer,"And then the handsome prince realized he had to go to the bathroom really bad. But the evil ogre, Barney, had left the men's room in the most wicked condition. So the prince went out back to the enchanted alley..."
Homer,"Sh-sh-sh. Anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon..."
Homer,"I'm never eatin' chili again. Ooh, chili!"
Homer,"Hmm, what's an ""eltdown?"" Eh."
Homer,Door's unlocked.
Homer,"Oh, don't make me choose."
Homer,"Yeah, I'm going right to the top."
Homer,"Uh-uh, no way. I don't want to miss a word."
Homer,"I'm picking it up. ""Sala"" seems to mean jerk. And I think ""Manjula"" means some kind of spaceship."
Homer,"Oh, they're newlyweds. They'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'."
Homer,"Hey, they stole our idea! See, look!"
Homer,"""I Cherish You, My Precious."" Mm, nah. ""To a heckuva blacksmith."" Nah, I already got him one."
Homer,"""You're A-peeling. Let's Never Split."" That's funny 'cause they're monkeys. So long, rejects."
Homer,"Mornin', Apu. Still in hot water with the squaw?"
Homer,"Oh, she's not gonna leave you right before Valentine's Day. That'd be like going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash."
Homer,Sweet mint julep... I'll be at Moe's.
Homer,"C'mon, boy. C'mon!"
Homer,"Goood dog! Good doggie! ""Tax Hike Approved""? Bad dog. Bad, bad dog."
Homer,Now to trim away the fat.
Homer,"Outlook. ""Vista."" No. ""Spotlight."" ""Mosaic."" Nah."
Homer,"Oh, sorry, Marge, that's in my stockpile. You can have this."
Homer,Gimme that!
Homer,"Well, don't just gasp, read it."
Homer,I used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds.
Homer,"We sold it, didn't we?"
Homer,"Yeah, I hate that song."
Homer,"Don't worry, honey. I got something really special planned for Valentine's Day."
Homer,Wouldn't you like to know?
Homer,Everybody's marriage is falling apart except ours. See the problem's communication. Too much communication.
Homer,"But Marge, it's worth it. Look, the Taco Bell dog. Yo quiero Ta... Hey, where'd it go? Here boy!"
Homer,This Valentine's crap has gone too far.
Homer,"And ask yourselves, people, who's to blame for all this?"
Homer,"Will you stop it?! It's easy to blame ourselves, but it's even easier to blame Apu. He's makin' us look bad!"
Homer,We've gotta stop that traitor Apu.
Homer,"C'mon, Apu. Make your move."
Homer,I'unno. Gasoline? Axes? I got some stuff in the trunk.
Homer,Let's roll.
Homer,"Not yet, I'm not. You'll know when I'm driving. And it'll..."
Homer,Only till eleven.
Homer,Not entirely.
Homer,"Oh, baby. We got him now. There's no escape from the airport."
Homer,"Hey, look! It's Elton John!"
Homer,Not if I can help it. And help it I might.
Homer,Mr. John. I'm your biggest fan. I've tape recorded all your songs off the radio.
Homer,Uhhhh.
Homer,"Sir Elton, my noble friends and I would like to dub you a Knight of the... Grand Concourse."
Homer,How the hell should I know? Just get in this cage.
Homer,"Not so fast, Apu!"
Homer,"We're putting an end to your insane Valentine's rampage. Never again will good, lazy men have to... What the--?"
Homer,Oh no you don't!
Homer,"Hey, you with the scarf! Stop skywriting!"
Homer,I am so sick of that damn code!
Homer,"If you won't stop, then I'll stop you!"
Homer,Lousy message.
Homer,Correction. Kill us both.
Homer,Ow! Prickers! Owwww!
Homer,Roses. So many roses.
Homer,Roses.
Homer,"Well, I think I have a collapsed lung, but okay!"
Homer,"Oh, no let me out! Let's get outta here!"
Homer,You drive. I eat.
Homer,I saw Krabappel's butt. I paid.
Homer,"C'mon, Mom / Flanders, woman!"
Homer,"Ohhh, you suck, Marge."
Homer,"Wow. Did you see that thing, Marge? So powerful. So commanding. So forceful and raw. It didn't ask, it just took."
Homer,Canyonero...
Homer,"Hey, a red one! Can I buy that? Please?"
Homer,Will do!
Homer,"And that's it, right?"
Homer,"But that's not for awhile, right?"
Homer,Sweet...
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Aw, crap! It's a girl's car. I can't drive this."
Homer,Shut up! Screw you guys!
Homer,Where's your keys? I'm takin' your car to work.
Homer,"Are you saying I'm gay? Because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it."
Homer,Fine.
Homer,Sucker.
Homer,"A three-chambered peanut! Marge, look what I did! Come quick! Hurry! Marge?"
Homer,"Marge, you've been out there all morning."
Homer,So... lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if you aren't around to see it.
Homer,"Aw, please come in. Maggie smells bad. And the cat wants something, but I don't know what."
Homer,"Well, that's a turn-off."
Homer,At least I've got a license.
Homer,"C'mon, kids, I went too far."
Homer,I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God. Plays.
Homer,I don't wanna pay four bucks to watch some monkey wannabe lay in the sun.
Homer,"Don't worry, honey. Daddy will fix that broken animal."
Homer,I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm just gonna wake him up.
Homer,"Uh-oh. Here's your slingshot, Lisa."
Homer,"Don't worry, kids. I know just what to do. Jumanji! Does anything from the movies actually work?"
Homer,"Back! Back, I say!"
Homer,Oh no. I'm out of popcorn.
Homer,You throw your peanuts!
Homer,"Ohhh, when will Detroit build a sun roof for the husky gentleman?"
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"Oh, thank you, God. And thank you Porta-John. You really saved my..."
Homer,Who's out there?!
Homer,"Oh, I'm gonna die! Jesus, Allah, Buddha, I love you all!"
Homer,Nice rhino.
Homer,"Oh, no! She's not gonna make it!"
Homer,"Ah, give me a minute..."
Homer,"Oh, Marge, you saved me!"
Homer,Is there anything that guy doesn't know?
Homer,"Oh, I'm sure of it!"
Homer,"I'd like to read the following statement, but I do so under my own free will. It has come to my attention that NBC sucks. I apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many FOX shows as possible. So in summary, NBC bad, FOX good. CBS great."
Homer,"19-- 1939?! Oh my God, I've gone back in time!"
Homer,I've got to warn everybody about Hitler! And get to the ice cream store!
Homer,Shut up! You haven't even been born yet.
Homer,"Oh boy, am I glad to see you guys."
Homer,Woo hoo! Let's party!
Homer,That's no way to address Sir Drinks-A-Lot.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Hey, Marge, what's your favorite radio station?"
Homer,"Well, Marge?"
Homer,What's your favorite radio station?
Homer,"Hey, that's super! See you later."
Homer,"Yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad."
Homer,They know I'm kidding.
Homer,"Okay, Bart, it's your turn to pick. Where are we headed? Bowling? Demolition derby? P.J. O'Harrigans? Isn't that a funny name? Huh? Huh?"
Homer,"We did a Lisa thing last month. And I'm glad we did, but now I think we should do something normal people would like."
Homer,"Go ahead, sweetie."
Homer,"Oh, no! Ho, ho. I'm not falling for that again. If it doesn't have Siamese twins in a jar, it's not a fair."
Homer,We're gonna go see Marmaduke?
Homer,What? And Marmaduke doesn't?
Homer,"This is all your fault for trading away your turn. Just for that, no dessert tonight!"
Homer,Good ol' government.
Homer,Thank God for grave robbers.
Homer,Fonzie's jacket!
Homer,Who's Fonzie?! Don't they teach you anything in school? He freed the squares.
Homer,Where? I don't see that.
Homer,Relax. I'm just boning up on the ol' Constitution.
Homer,I didn't mean to! Look!
Homer,Wha?!
Homer,"Finally, a company that understands my needs."
Homer,So we're even then?
Homer,"It's called caring, Marge."
Homer,"Ya gotta admit, Marge, that's a lot more roaming."
Homer,"Hey, this is pretty comfortable. That Andy Capp was onto something."
Homer,"Just pretend it's a tree, honey. Or as we say at OmniTouch, a Progress Tree."
Homer,Wha?! I heard a yell. Did you touch a wire?
Homer,"Nothing. They just needed a place to put all the electronic gizmos, and I know how much you like that sciencey stuff so I..."
Homer,"Come on, Lisa, try and see this from the OmniTouch Corporation's point of view."
Homer,Hm. That thought never occurred to me. Funny how your mind works in a crisis.
Homer,"Lisa, what's your favorite movie?"
Homer,"That's right, ""The Odd Couple."" So meet your comically mismatched roommate, Bart Simpson."
Homer,"Ooh, anything spicy?"
Homer,Great. I'm gonna eat mayonnaise!
Homer,"Well, well, if it isn't Frick and Frack, Jack and Jill, Fred and Ethel, the Three..."
Homer,"Bart, stop squeaking your chair!"
Homer,"If you've got to do something, click this pen."
Homer,"Hey, that looks like fun."
Homer,"You're on! Lisa, you play winner."
Homer,"Oh, honey, you missed a great race. Bart was winning, but then he said ""this is stupid"" and he stopped, and I won!"
Homer,"Hey, you're mad at me. That wasn't your mayonnaise, was it?"
Homer,Maybe you'd feel better if we watched some TV together.
Homer,No it's not.
Homer,"Oooh, here's something you'd like. ""When Animals Attack Magicians."""
Homer,Awful entertaining.
Homer,Somebody wants mommy to change baby's diaper.
Homer,Yes it is.
Homer,Great. Maybe on the way back we can swing by the demolition derby and have a nice talk.
Homer,"Well, that's a relief."
Homer,"Give it a try, honey."
Homer,"It's true. I'm always making clever noises, and she never chuckles at 'em."
Homer,"Oh, no you don't. Screw that touchy, queery crap! We'll take the harsh antacids. Nothing's too good for my little girl."
Homer,I sure settled his hash. Imagine that quack thinking you'd try one of those crazy New-Age cures.
Homer,"Sure they are, honey."
Homer,"I'm sorry, Lisa. Oh, it's not your fault. I know we love each other, Dad, but we're two very different people. And, much as I hate to say it, as time goes on, we'll probably just drift further and further apart."
Homer,"Oh Lisa, honey, I won't ever let that happen."
Homer,"Nah, you must be thinking of your mother. I'm always exploring alternatives and expanding my horizons into realms of... Can't we just go in?"
Homer,"Oh good, I've been meaning to buy a ""Dream Catcher?"" Gimme a break."
Homer,"Other cultures are fine. I'm just saying I can get along in life without a ""tooth brush."""
Homer,And a ooga-booga to you too.
Homer,Absolutely not. My little girl's tummy hurts. Do you have anything to stop her complaining?
Homer,"Let's try some oil of Lorenzo. And, uh, what's keeping Joan Rivers alive?"
Homer,Oh no. No freezing.
Homer,Can you pee in it?
Homer,Me too.
Homer,"Oh, my."
Homer,OOH EEE OOH AH AH / TING TANG WALLA WALLA BING BANG / OOH EEE OOH AH AH / WALLA BING BANG TING TING TOOO!
Homer,"Heyyy, this piece of junk is finally doing something."
Homer,Oh yeah... art.
Homer,Woo! Sensory deprivation kicks ass.
Homer,"Okay, I'm ready to get out now... Yoo hoo! Hippie lady! Hippie lady?! Hey! Hippie lady!"
Homer,Whoa! What's going on? Ow! Oh! This inner peace stuff is tough on the old coconut.
Homer,Hippie Lady I wanna get out.
Homer,I told the witch doctor there's tightness in my chest. Bom-bom-bom-bom... I told the witch doctor he had to run a test...
Homer,Hi sweetie.
Homer,I went on a wild ride without ever leaving the building. How was yours?
Homer,Like what?
Homer,"Whoa, look at that car burn! Does it get any better than this?"
Homer,"So I said to that nurse, ""You can take your free tetanus shot and shove it."""
Homer,You better believe I did.
Homer,"Well, I really gave him no choice. Y'see..."
Homer,Must eat beef... must defeat guy I just met...
Homer,Wait. There's a place like that in Springfield?! Then why are we eating this crap?
Homer,"C'mon, everybody, we're going to the Slaughterhouse!"
Homer,Didn't I?
Homer,Wow. It's even more wonderful than Lisa said!
Homer,"Wait a minute. Is this the biggest steak you've got? 72 ounces? I thought this was supposed to be a steakhouse, not a little... girly... underpantsy... pink doily... tea party place."
Homer,"Oooh, I'll have that one. And to drink... ... meatballs."
Homer,They like me because I'm brave.
Homer,Oh yeah? What do you know about it? Y--
Homer,It's you! You're him! You're Tony Randall!
Homer,Greenhorns! Who's a greenhorn? What's a greenhorn?
Homer,"Oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. Mr. No-Belly... Mr... Hasn't-Got-A-Belly..."
Homer,"Huh? Oh, right. The steak."
Homer,So much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat...
Homer,Lousy drunks. I'll show them.
Homer,What's happening to me? There's still food... but I don't want to eat it. I've become everything I've ever hated.
Homer,"My hat's off to you, Red. You're a true American hero. And you did it with style and dignity and... Hey, you're not breathing. Don't people usually breathe?"
Homer,"He called me ""Greenhorn."" I called him Tony Randall. It was a thing we had."
Homer,"Oh yes he will! And on time, too!"
Homer,"I've got to, honey. I owe it to ol' Red, as both his friend and his killer."
Homer,Don't you have school?
Homer,"Ah, touché."
Homer,"Bye, Marge!"
Homer,Aren't you gonna say bye?
Homer,That didn't sound like you meant it.
Homer,"That's more like it. So long, suckers!"
Homer,Why you gotta... Come on! Ah! Now I'm gettin' the hang of this thing. I don't know why I didn't become a trucker before.
Homer,"Oh, yeah? My left arm says different."
Homer,Piece o' cake. Just need a little truck-driving music.
Homer,Ohhh.
Homer,That little punk.
Homer,"Sure thing, Gwenn."
Homer,"Aww... that's a nice, friendly gal."
Homer,Wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? Watching all the people come and go. You could have a different best friend every day.
Homer,"Great. I'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. And then when the paperwork is done, I'll make Gwenn my wife."
Homer,For now...
Homer,It ate everybody.
Homer,Stupid!
Homer,I bet ol' Red caught himself a mess o' catfish with these fishing sticks.
Homer,"Relax, boy. We're ahead of schedule."
Homer,Ten hours?! We gotta roll!
Homer,"Uh, yeah. I need something that'll keep me awake, alert, and reckless all night long."
Homer,Sold!
Homer,No problem. I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.
Homer,Okay-We're-All-Set-Let's-Put-The-Pedal-To-The-Metal!
Homer,"I whole-heartedly-agree. Oh-man-I'm-really-wired. This-is-a-big-mistake-I-can... Ohhh, here comes the sleeping pills. So drowsy. Pep-pills-perking-up-again. I-could-drive allll Niiight..."
Homer,I fell asleep at the wheel! But we didn't crash. It's a miracle!
Homer,You'll never believe what happened. I fell asleep at the wheel and the truck drove here by itself.
Homer,The what now?
Homer,The trucks drive themselves?
Homer,"Well, I'm not really a trucker, so I don't talk to the rep that often."
Homer,"Wow! You guys are even lazier than me! Well, don't worry. I'll keep your secret."
Homer,"Hey, Bart, watch me run down this old lady."
Homer,"The second I let go of the wheel, this little wonder kicks in."
Homer,"And if scaring old ladies don't float your boat, watch this!"
Homer,"C'mon out, boy. It's windy."
Homer,"Relax, everybody! The Navitron Auto-Drive System is driving the truck for me! But keep it a secret! It's a big scam! Okay?"
Homer,"Look, son. It's one of nature's most beautiful sights -- the convoy."
Homer,"Oh, I shoulda known. They're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity."
Homer,"Thank you sir, may I have another?"
Homer,"Oh, why do all my trips end like this?"
Homer,"Eat water, good buddy."
Homer,"I think we lost 'em, Bart."
Homer,"Well, well, well. Looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy."
Homer,All right.
Homer,I'm keeping a promise to an American roadmaster.
Homer,"Red. The trucker. Big fat guy, couldn't handle his steak?"
Homer,We'll get past that barrier somehow. Ol' Blinky here will find a way.
Homer,"I'm not Red, I'm Homer."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Ten-four, dead buddy."
Homer,"This is Red Barclay's shipment. On time, as always."
Homer,"Well... the last time I saw him, he was in a big plastic bag."
Homer,"Well, son. I guess it's time to go home."
Homer,"No, but I'm sure the good Lord will provide."
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"Oh, man. This is the hottest Easter ever."
Homer,"Relax, I found it in the dumpster."
Homer,Heads up!
Homer,"Well, hel-lo!"
Homer,"'Course not. There's no pain in the Garden of Eden. Hey, you must be Eve."
Homer,Looks like God made you out of my sexiest rib.
Homer,Is there!
Homer,Don't mind if I do!
Homer,"Uh, good morning, Lord. I just have to, ah, compliment you on this beautifully crafted mate."
Homer,"No, you're too kind. And wise, and righteous... I can't believe you don't have a girlfriend."
Homer,"No problem, Lord. And it would be even easier to avoid that temptation if I had a few extra wives."
Homer,Just sayin'...
Homer,"Sorry, I already gave him a name. ""Land monster."""
Homer,Branch monster.
Homer,Why won't you be art?!
Homer,You're pretty uptight for a naked chick. You know what would loosen you up? A little fruit.
Homer,And you keep saying we need to do things together...
Homer,"Uh, um, uh... I think we should see other people?"
Homer,Usually a mink massage makes me feel better. But something's missing now.
Homer,I didn't say stop.
Homer,"Yeah, just like yesterday."
Homer,"I gave a rib to Eve, and now she's gone forever."
Homer,"Oh, poor Eve. What are you doing out there in that horrible place?"
Homer,"This is my fault. I shoulda stood up for you during that whole ""Applegate"" thing."
Homer,"Don't say that! Maybe I can sneak you back in. I mean, God can't be everywhere at once, right?"
Homer,"C'mon, Eve. Hurry!"
Homer,"Ohhh, my dear, sweet Eve. I love you even more than the butterscotch pond or the porno bush."
Homer,"Oh, there, there, I'm sure he's gone to a better place, Lord."
Homer,"Hey, now let's not do anything rash... God is love, right?"
Homer,"Ohhh, my back. So this must be that pain thing."
Homer,"Oh, yeah. Definitely pain!"
Homer,This sucks. Things were so much better back in the Garden.
Homer,The pie shall be cut in two. Then each man shall receive... death. I'll eat the pie.
Homer,"Eh, it's not the end of the world."
Homer,I never used those pizza coupons.
Homer,"Where do you think you're going, Missy?"
Homer,"Ooh, I smell barbecue!"
Homer,"Hey, look! Oh, they're out of hot dogs! And the cole slaw has pineapple in it! German potato salad!"
Homer,You put da beer in da coconut and drink it all up / You put da beer in da coconut and throw da can away...
Homer,You throw da can away...
Homer,You throw da can away...
Homer,"Marge, I'm out of beer."
Homer,"But, Marge, I'm not like other men. That's why you buy my pants at that special store."
Homer,"Fine. I'll drop everything I'm doing just for you. But you'll have to live with the guilt of ruining my Saturday. Can you live with that, Marge? Huh? Can ya?"
Homer,Can you?
Homer,"'Scuse me, I have a few questions for Pop."
Homer,"Look Pop, I'm planning some expert home repairs, and I need a pair of bolt cutters, or wire cutters, or something to get the lock off my toolbox."
Homer,I'd like to return this barbecue kit.
Homer,A man in an apron!
Homer,"No, no, I'm into chicken."
Homer,Mmmm... hippo...
Homer,"How 'bout it, Bart? Would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?"
Homer,We can all burn evidence in it.
Homer,"There, that wasn't so hard... was it, honey?"
Homer,"Okay, sweetie. Daddy'll take over."
Homer,"Oh, yeah. That's a fine looking..."
Homer,"Okay, no big deal..."
Homer,Stupid Lisa.
Homer,You gotta build fast! Cement drying!
Homer,"All right, let's see..."
Homer,"English side ruined! Must use French instructions! ""Le grille?"" What the hell is that?!"
Homer,Come on... fit you...
Homer,"Yeah, that's one fine-looking barbecue pit... Why doesn't mine look like that?!"
Homer,Why?! Why must life be so hard? Why must I fail in every attempt at masonry?
Homer,"Well, if you'll follow the flashlight, you'll see the receipt embedded here and here... and elements of the box here, here, and possibly here."
Homer,"Come on, you..."
Homer,"Well, of course. Any kid would love to have this, uh... activity center. It teaches them while they learn."
Homer,"But, but..."
Homer,I'll never get rid of it. It'll follow me to the ends of the Earth!
Homer,All right! My bumper fell off!
Homer,Not my fault! Act of God! Act of God!
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Shaving my shoulders / I'm gettin' it all shaved off...
Homer,Take the kids out back.
Homer,I'll handle this.
Homer,Oh yeah? Prove it.
Homer,"Uh... All right! Just go ahead and sue me. Everybody else does! The average settlement is $68,000."
Homer,You mean this hunka junk? This isn't art. Just a barbecue that pushed me over the edge. Didn't you? Didn't you?! You stupid so...
Homer,"Oh, I got that, lady."
Homer,This lady says I'm an artist.
Homer,"In high school I was voted ""Most Likely to be a Mental Patient, Hillbilly, or Chimpanzee!"""
Homer,So you'd better catch the fever. Catch it...
Homer,"Lisa, all great artists love free food. Check out Jasper Johns."
Homer,"Woo hoo! Look, Marge, my first sale! In your face, Jasper Johns!"
Homer,"I'm gonna be an outsider artist! That way, I can turn all these old baseball cards, Disney memorabilia, and antiques into something valuable."
Homer,"Hey, I've always had an interest in art, dating back to my schoolgirl days when I painted portrait after portrait of Ringo Starr."
Homer,"I think I remember my own life, Marge."
Homer,"Astrid said the key to my art is anger. But you know me, I'm Mister Mellow."
Homer,"So I'm giving you kids permission to get me mad. C'mon, gimme what you got."
Homer,"Good work, honey. Keep it comin'."
Homer,"Moe, this is Astrid, my ""dealer."" And these are my fans, Gunter, Kyoto, and Cecil Hampstead-on-Cecil-Cecil."
Homer,"What do we owe you, Moe?"
Homer,All right.
Homer,Is it about pies?
Homer,"Wow. It's like Marge's dream come true... for me! Isn't that great, Marge?! For me!"
Homer,"Look Marge, they're advertising my show in ""Art in America."" It's the first time I've been mentioned there, that I know of."
Homer,Good night.
Homer,You're upset about something. Is this about that trip Barney and I took to Machu Picchu?
Homer,"Aw, honey, I've always liked your art. Your paintings look like the things they look like."
Homer,"Frankly, I'd be a little turned on."
Homer,"Marge, I've screwed up everything I've ever done. I mean, look at Bart. But I finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. And that feels pretty good."
Homer,Now you're making sense. Good night.
Homer,"I give you ""Botched Hibachi."" The tricycle is on loan from the Maggie Simpson collection."
Homer,"This piece I call ""Failed Shelving Unit with Stupid Stuck Chainsaw and Applesauce."""
Homer,"And finally, my thing de resistance, ""Attempted Birdhouse I."""
Homer,"Shall we start the bidding at, say, ten thousand dollars?"
Homer,"All right, how about a million?"
Homer,What's going on here? You weirdos love this stuff.
Homer,"Wait! Come back! I'm a God to you! Worship me -- or fear my wrath! Please fear my wrath, please... Call me."
Homer,I don't get it. Why don't people like my art anymore?
Homer,"Hey, Ray J. Johnson never changed his act and he's more popular now than he's ever been."
Homer,You can call him Ray / Or you can call him J. / Or you can call him Ray J. / But you doesn't have to call him...
Homer,Matt Groening? What's he doing in a museum? He can barely draw.
Homer,"Ow! Oh no, I'm being erased!"
Homer,He must be a hundred feet tall.
Homer,It's glorious! The streets are paved with water. You could ride a walrus to work!
Homer,"Mmmm, split-pea."
Homer,With ham!
Homer,"No, these guys are geniuses. I could never think of something like soup or a pencil."
Homer,I'm just gonna rest for a minute.
Homer,What the?! Who the?! Hey!
Homer,Ow! Ah! No! Ow! Ow! Hey! Ow! Ow! You're mean.
Homer,Eww...
Homer,Ow! Hey! No! No! Ow! N-No! Ow!
Homer,"No, no, Andy, no!"
Homer,Marge! Why does Art hate me? I never did anything to Art.
Homer,"Oh, let's get out of here."
Homer,Is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets?
Homer,Not the Reichstag!
Homer,Why'd he do that?
Homer,Killer umbrellas? Of course. Exquisite.
Homer,"Big? Daring? Lisa, that's it! I've got an idea for a wonderful art project that'll make everyone love me again. Step one: steal all the doormats in town."
Homer,"Adios, ""Casa de Flanders."""
Homer,"So long, The Simpsons!"
Homer,Step two: snorkel the animals.
Homer,Great. I'll do the pony while you do the lions.
Homer,Make sure you strap 'em on real tight.
Homer,"Now, step three..."
Homer,"That's for the courts to decide, son."
Homer,"Wake up! Wake up, Springfield!"
Homer,I've got a surprise for youuu!
Homer,"People of Springfield, behold my latest work!"
Homer,It's conceptual art -- the Grand Canals of Springfield. Just like Venice without the black plague. What do you think?
Homer,"No, I'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue. You'll always be the artist in the family."
Homer,Is that our house?
Homer,And is that us on the roof?
Homer,Are we kissing?
Homer,A mascot contest?! I'm sure to win that. Unless one of you jinxes me.
Homer,"Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
Homer,"Well, you said I couldn't do it, but here it is! Meet Abby the Olympic Tabby."
Homer,"Just for the prototype, honey."
Homer,"Knowing you always hate my first idea, I prepared a backup. How about a big Olympic hello for Springy, the Springfield Spring!"
Homer,It's fun for the whole family. And the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.
Homer,God bless America!
Homer,"They picked Springy! In your face, Patty and Selma!"
Homer,I've never wanted a beer worse in my life.
Homer,"I love you, honey."
Homer,"To you, my bubbly, long-necked, beechwood-aged lover."
Homer,He says what we're all thinking.
Homer,"Lucky stiff. I'm working my ass off here. Good steak, honey."
Homer,I'llgetit.
Homer,Woo hoo! My springs! They finally came!
Homer,"Yeah, but I should have no problem selling a thousand springs."
Homer,"Idiots! Ooh, these are fun!"
Homer,"Hello, little girl, is your mommy home? You'll need to ask her for five dollars to buy Mr. Bouncy Best-Friend."
Homer,"Boy, Lenny, you sure look hungry. Have some nuts."
Homer,"Now if you want to be the life of the party like Lenny here, just place your order for this hilarious novelty item."
Homer,"Boy, Moe, you sure look angry. Here, have some nuts."
Homer,"Welcome to the Kitchen of Tomorrow today! Marge, how much would you pay for a self-flipping hamburger pan?"
Homer,"Don't answer yet. Watch how easy it is to flip hamburgers with the help of God's greatest creation, the spring."
Homer,"Now, watch this..."
Homer,Ow! Ohhh...
Homer,"Some second degree burns, but some first class burgers."
Homer,But you haven't seen the Baby of Tomorrow! Ta-daa!
Homer,"Now if I drop her, no more tears."
Homer,"""D"" it up, Marge. I'm goin' to the hole."
Homer,You flush one down / It swirls around / Nine hundred and ninety-nine springs to flush down...
Homer,"Of course not! ""Nine hundred and ninety-six springs to flush down / Nine hundred and ninety-six spriiings..."""
Homer,A hundred and thirty-five springs to flush down. A hundred and thirty-five springs...
Homer,And I do! Woo!
Homer,"Oh, we stopped those when the kids said I was too fat to carry."
Homer,Can't we go home yet? My feet hurt. All this fresh air is making my hair move. And I don't know how much longer I can complain.
Homer,"Could we, Marge? Could we get a horse?"
Homer,There are some dogs. We could all ride dogs.
Homer,"Pew, well, I dodged a bullet."
Homer,Clown.
Homer,"Thanks, Noodles."
Homer,"Hey, it's not just a store. It's a ""mega"" store. ""Mega"" means ""good."" And ""store"" means ""thing."""
Homer,"Wow, what a high-tech wonderland. Oop, got an itch."
Homer,"Yeah, they're not great."
Homer,I DO!
Homer,I don't know. Just give me the dollar.
Homer,I do!
Homer,I do.
Homer,Easy... easyyy...
Homer,"Woo hoo! Look at me, I can juggle!"
Homer,"I see. Well, I'll need some beer."
Homer,"Oh, Arthur Fortune!"
Homer,"Well, you don't have to call me slovenly."
Homer,"Well, how 'bout donating money to charity? Lots of crazy old coots do that."
Homer,Can do.
Homer,"Wait a minute... because I brought the check, they named a wing after me? Oh, you must be mad."
Homer,"Gee, I feel bad. If people knew the real Monty Burns, and not the silver-dollar-throwing morphine addict you've become, they might like you."
Homer,"Good luck, Mr. Burns. And if you get in trouble, I wrote some jokes about how white people are different from black people."
Homer,"You see white people have names like ""Lenny,"" whereas, black people have names like ""Carl."""
Homer,Good thing those lesbians knew CPR.
Homer,"Ooo, Arthur Fortune. You know what that fabulous man just did? He gave the Springfield zoo two male Pandas, and got them to mate successfully."
Homer,"Oh, yeah! And I'm not easily impressed. Wow! A blue car!"
Homer,A sober Irishman?
Homer,"Whew, that was one long helicopter ride."
Homer,"Do you really think you can capture the Loch Ness Monster? I mean, he's eluded Leonard Nimoy and Peter Graves."
Homer,"Hey, Willie. That old couple looks just like you."
Homer,Good. Good. One more.
Homer,"Uh, to work in your power plant?"
Homer,Check.
Homer,Tilt? You monster!
Homer,"Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We're gonna find that monster, no matter how long it takes. Besides, I'm getting kind of used to wearing a kilt!"
Homer,Can you believe I'm a size four? Woo!
Homer,No way! Aberdeen rules!
Homer,God! It's him!
Homer,"Well, if you wanted people to love you, you sure blew it with that insane rampage."
Homer,"But you know what? To be loved you have to be nice to people. Every day! But, to be hated, you don't have to do squat."
Homer,"So what do we do with our friend here? Uh, throw him in the dumpster?"
Homer,"Come on, Nessie. One more pull."
Homer,"Okay, okay... You want a shrimp cocktail?"
Homer,Shuuuut uppa you mouth.
Homer,"All right, a gross-out contest! Grandma Plopwell, you've done it again."
Homer,I'm hot buttered / Check it and see / I got a fever of four fifty-three...
Homer,I'm hot... so very hot...
Homer,Fours?
Homer,Ow! Ow! Oh!
Homer,Judges can't win the contest! Booooo!
Homer,Take that!
Homer,"Look, I got runner-up prize."
Homer,No. But I got it.
Homer,Stealing is wrong.
Homer,Free Boudoir Photography. Sweet.
Homer,Hm...
Homer,"Oh, right."
Homer,"Yes, there's a real think piece here about a bra sale."
Homer,"Hey, that is wonderful, sweetie. I'm gonna read it just as soon as I finish what I'm doing here."
Homer,I envy them.
Homer,"Hello, I have a certificate for a free erotic photo session."
Homer,Uh... Geraldo... Simpson.
Homer,Who told you?
Homer,"Uh, you're not gonna ask me to pose nude, are ya?"
Homer,"Well, I don't, but the Block Association seems to. They wanted a ""traditional"" Santa Claus."
Homer,"Oh, that's great, honey. You tell me everything you can before the commercial's over."
Homer,Up-bup-bup-bup.
Homer,Are you sure you're a fully accredited and bonded pornographer?
Homer,Please be kind.
Homer,Now you're sure this will save my marriage?
Homer,Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!
Homer,"Okay, I think he's gone."
Homer,Let's reschedule.
Homer,"Gee, you said you were gonna to make me look sexier, but it's awfully dark in here."
Homer,It's time to get Homer-erotic.
Homer,"Maarge. Oh, Maaarge."
Homer,I've got something for you.
Homer,"Houston, we have a problem. A sexy problem."
Homer,Grrr. I'm gonna to maul you.
Homer,"No, no. It's just our basement."
Homer,"Yeah, so? Come on! More kissing!"
Homer,But I was gonna score...
Homer,Larry Flynt is right! You guys stink!
Homer,"Now's our opening. Come on, you idiots, we're taking back this town!"
Homer,Did you have fun with your robot buddy?
Homer,I am.
Homer,Wow. I can't believe someone I never heard of is hangin' out with a guy like me.
Homer,"Yes, I did."
Homer,Larry Flynt is right! You guys stink!
Homer,"Hey, why didn't you tell me the new issue of ""Weird"" was here?! I love their hilarious send-ups of hit movies."
Homer,"""Gigabytes!"" They've done it again. Gigabytes. Wait, this isn't ""Weird."" Why, there's no magazine called ""Weird,"" is there?"
Homer,The Internet? Is that thing still around?
Homer,"Come on, Lisa! Monkeys!"
Homer,"Oh yeah. I'm betting on Jai-Alai in the Cayman Islands, I invested in something called News Corp..."
Homer,Ahh! Undo! Undo! Uhh.
Homer,"Well, let's check the old bank account."
Homer,See? Even after all my cyber-squandering we've still got twelve hundred dollars.
Homer,"You seem to know an awful lot about this for an ""innocent person."""
Homer,"Ohh, don't worry, sweetheart, I'll get us the money. Even if I have to get a second job."
Homer,"Yes, sir."
Homer,"I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir."
Homer,"It's just that you and Maude live like royalty in your fancy castle, while I got Marge trapped over there like a pig in a mud beehive."
Homer,They're years ahead of us.
Homer,"Well, if you're not rich then how come you have a new refrigerator, an electric can opener, a milkshake machine..."
Homer,Sweet.
Homer,Go on...
Homer,"Maybe you're right, Ned. Maybe you're right."
Homer,There's only three left in the world!
Homer,"I'm squeezing... I'm squee-zing it. Hey, I squeezed so hard it went into my hand."
Homer,"Wow, this plankton's only 33 cents."
Homer,"Sure, by their standards, but we live in America."
Homer,But it's so cheap.
Homer,"Well, let's see what's in the ol' vacation fund."
Homer,"A little late for ""could've's,"" Marge."
Homer,"No, mon, let's go home to Jamaica. I and I been in Babylon too long."
Homer,"No, no Japan. Jamaica! I wanna pass the doochie on the lefthand side."
Homer,"Oh, so Flanders thinks he can steal our vacation, huh?"
Homer,C'mon!
Homer,"Sayonara, suckers!"
Homer,"That's not how I remember it. Besides, if we want to see Japanese people we could have gone to the zoo."
Homer,What? The guy who washes the elephants is Japanese. His name is Takashi. He's in my book club.
Homer,"Yeah, isn't it amazing? They're filming one right now in the bathroom."
Homer,It's gonna be on towards the end of the flight.
Homer,"Marge, they stole my idea!"
Homer,Here's our room!
Homer,I don't have time for that.
Homer,"Ohh, yeah..."
Homer,"Oh, all right."
Homer,Whew. All that seizing made me hungry.
Homer,The toilet recommended a place called AmericaTown.
Homer,I can't believe they stuck us at Taxachusetts.
Homer,"Hey, you know, I once knew a man from Nantucket."
Homer,Let's just say the stories about him are greatly exaggerated.
Homer,"Oooh, they got our number."
Homer,One square watermelon please.
Homer,It's worth every cent. I'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.
Homer,"Oh, of course. You're right. You know, I read about a Shinto tea house where they practice the traditional... Run, Bart!"
Homer,Looks like he's doing a commercial.
Homer,"Mmm... fifty dollar pretzel. Hey, what's Baby Huey doing?"
Homer,Hmmm...
Homer,"Spare some salt, tubby?"
Homer,"Hey, that's mine!"
Homer,"Like we say in my country, ""Hasta la vista, baby."""
Homer,"Yeah, and I'm Clobbersaurus."
Homer,All hail Emperor Clobbersaurus!
Homer,Thank God. I couldn't take another minute in this hell-hole.
Homer,"Oh, I'm sick of doing Japanese stuff. In jail we had to be in this dumb Kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin and I wanted to be Oshi, but they made me Ori."
Homer,I didn't... What is it? Lunch?
Homer,"Don't worry, ichiban. I'll show you something Japanese."
Homer,It's a crane. The Japanese believe they bring good luck.
Homer,Shimatta baka-me!
Homer,This sucks. What else is on?
Homer,"Well, I haven't talked it over with the family, but I think we'd all like a free dinner at AmericaTown."
Homer,Ignor-- what?
Homer,"Do ""OW THAT HURTS."""
Homer,Could someone please whack my hernia back in?
Homer,Is the answer Japan?
Homer,Why are you so cruel?
Homer,"Well, at least we're past the lightning round."
Homer,"Hmmm, I see... I sure hope they don't have an ice cream round."
Homer,Marge! Your shoe!
Homer,"Well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock."
Homer,It burns! It burns!
Homer,It burns! It burns!
Homer,"Before I go, I want to say something. Game shows aren't about cruelty, they're about greed and wonderful prizes like poorly-built catamarans. But somewhere along the line, you lost your way. For shame."
Homer,"I love this show. Take that, you stupid hosers!"
Homer,Undo! Undo!
Homer,My children deserve to see me get a free gift.
Homer,But I like the nice things you said about me.
Homer,"Hello, I, uh, love your planet deeply and am interested in purchasing one of your electronic autos."
Homer,What kind a mint?
Homer,"Yeah, it's got a lot of other problems too."
Homer,"Relax, we're in an electric car."
Homer,See? Everything's fine.
Homer,"Hey, dolphins."
Homer,Oopsie.
Homer,"Hi, girls."
Homer,Ohhh.
Homer,Salt water seems to be good for it.
Homer,"Um, I'm sorry, the car did not meet my eco-concerns. Can I have my prize now?"
Homer,We didn't? That's odd. Seems like we would've done that right after we left the car place.
Homer,"Well, here it is, so we can open it and find out now."
Homer,"Aww, movie tickets! That hardly seems worth destroying a car."
Homer,Who else is in it?
Homer,"Mel Gibson is just a guy, Marge. No different than me or Lenny."
Homer,"Hmmm, I'm not certain about Lenny."
Homer,Okay...
Homer,"Uh, you're thinking about me, right?"
Homer,I will now.
Homer,Bo-ring.
Homer,At least the Jimmy Stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan.
Homer,"Well, that was a stinker."
Homer,"Oh, you're just saying that because your ""boyfriend"" was in it. I'll bet you would've hated it if me and Lenny were Mr. Smith."
Homer,"Oh, that's it! I'm telling Mr. Stupidest man alive what I really thought of his movie! Hey, Gibson!"
Homer,Got a pencil?
Homer,Thanks.
Homer,stupid...
Homer,'Preciate it.
Homer,"Door, Marge."
Homer,"And I've been lookin' for you, too, pal!"
Homer,"Listen, Gibson, I'm tired of Hollywood pretty boys like you and Jack Valenti thinking you can have any woman you want. You see this?"
Homer,It symbolizes that she's my property and I own her.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Really? You want my help? Marge, did you hear that? Mel Gibson wants my help! Mel Gibson!"
Homer,Shuut-uup...
Homer,"She's always doing that, Mel."
Homer,Guilty as charged.
Homer,"You had me at ""Hello."""
Homer,"A mini-van... Oh boy, you celebrities sure know how to live. What is this? Toyota Previa?"
Homer,Sweet.
Homer,"Okay, while Mel and I are working, why don't you guys do the town? I hear all the stars eat at a place called Planet Hollywood."
Homer,"Sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. Mel's movie really stinks."
Homer,"Okay, this opening scene should be in fast motion. Everybody likes that 'cause it looks funny."
Homer,I mean Lisa.
Homer,"Okay, here you need a musical montage where you try on lots of funny hats. It'll let us see your playful side."
Homer,"Yeah, but..."
Homer,They will if you set up that the dog is evil. All you have to do is show him doing this and people will suspect the dog.
Homer,Ah-ah-ah! Now here's your biggest problem of all...
Homer,"And it was fine for the 1930's. The country was doing great back then. Everyone was into talking. But now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! And seats with beverage holders, but mainly action."
Homer,"Oh! Mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage I've ever seen. And it's not easy for me to say that."
Homer,It was symbolism. He was mad.
Homer,Piece o' cake. Now where's that kid with my latte?
Homer,... we-shot-last-night...
Homer,"Mel, you're coming off desperate. Roll it, Louie!"
Homer,Here comes two!
Homer,I second that motion...
Homer,...with a vengeance!
Homer,Those movies sucked. I only saw 'em to get Marge into the sack. PS: mission accomplished.
Homer,"Yeah, guys like me."
Homer,"Do the words ""Executive Producer"" mean anything to you?"
Homer,We'll talk.
Homer,Watch out! Comin' through! Mach schnell!
Homer,I'm on it.
Homer,"How old are you, anyway?"
Homer,Sorry I asked.
Homer,"Oh, crap! Here they come!"
Homer,"Hey, come on, turn that down-under frown upside down. We're not finished yet."
Homer,No time talk! Need steal car! Must save powerful but controversial movie!
Homer,Hel-lo.
Homer,"Quick, Mel, get in!"
Homer,"Movies aren't stupid! They fill us with romance and hatred and revenge fantasies. ""Lethal Weapon"" showed us that suicide is funny."
Homer,"Before ""Lethal Weapon 2"", I never thought there could be a bomb in my toilet, but now I check every time."
Homer,They are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
Homer,No offense.
Homer,"Well, I think we lost 'em."
Homer,"Oh, wait. There they are."
Homer,"Great idea, Mel. Now it's my turn."
Homer,"I'm tired of running away. Did ""Braveheart"" run away? Did ""Payback"" run away? It's time we showed those suits what we're made of."
Homer,"It's your plan, from ""Braveheart."" Your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered."
Homer,"Actually, I didn't see it, but on the poster it..."
Homer,I think so.
Homer,No.
Homer,"I don't get it, Mel. How can you be so calm and cool? My stomach's full of vomiting butterflies."
Homer,"Okay, that's it. Let's get ready to meet our public."
Homer,/ Ow!
Homer,We shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes.
Homer,"Oh, I'm sorry I ruined your career, Mel."
Homer,"How did the country lose its way, Mel? When did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?"
Homer,"Well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling on our next picture."
Homer,"Hey, what about a prequel to something? Everybody loves prequels."
Homer,"Okay, Mr. Difficult. How about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some?"
Homer,"No, wait. A ghost who wins the lottery! You could be the ghost or the lottery commissioner. Ooh, what about Indiana Jones? Does anyone own the rights to that?"
Homer,"Hey, Mel. I fell out."
Homer,Thank you for getting me out of work.
Homer,"Yeah, he's somethin' else, all right."
Homer,"Hey, that looks like Bart."
Homer,"Hi, Marge. It's me, Homer."
Homer,What? Time to go?
Homer,Candy bar?
Homer,I'd say he's coming out of the Pep Closet.
Homer,They become your slaves...
Homer,"It's all about trust, honey."
Homer,Some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.
Homer,Sure you do. All your favorite stars have used drugs: Brett Butler.... Tim Allen...
Homer,Andy Dick...
Homer,"Yeah, and I'm a size four."
Homer,Why you little...!
Homer,"Son, let's forget all about that drug thing. Why don't you just come down and have some taffy?"
Homer,Just take one bite. If you're not one hundred per cent different...
Homer,Ow!
Homer,"Geez, what's the big deal? Look, I'll even eat some."
Homer,Now--
Homer,"Way to guilt him, Marge!"
Homer,Do I get a card?
Homer,Hmm. My career has kinda lost momentum...
Homer,"Well, I have been thinking about making them into cut-offs..."
Homer,"I tell ya, the kid's a wonder. He organized all the lawsuits against me into one class action."
Homer,You know it. Plus he gave me this appointment dealy.
Homer,Got my whole week in there.
Homer,"Oh, this thing'll do anything. Watch, I'll ask it how many leagues in a furlong. No, wait... I'll make it say ""Whatsa matta you?"" in Turkish."
Homer,And look at this. A cheese grater!
Homer,"Well, if you want one, they sell 'em at..."
Homer,The boy's still studying?
Homer,"He's gone from Goofus to Gallant, and we owe it all to mind-bending pills."
Homer,"Ooh, let's go to the waterpark. My ten-year ban ended yesterday."
Homer,Oh... Marge!
Homer,Really? With butterscotch on it?
Homer,"Marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ever given her husband."
Homer,That was fun. We have to get out more often.
Homer,"Well, sure, if it's true."
Homer,Ray J. funny... or O.J. funny?
Homer,Even mine?
Homer,"Hey, I had Lenny's name on that!"
Homer,Maarge. I think Bart's gone crazy!
Homer,"Hey, you found my needlenose pliers."
Homer,"Wake up, honey!"
Homer,He quit blinking. He says that's when they get ya.
Homer,After we trusted you...
Homer,Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna have a tummyache.
Homer,"Hey, there was just air in mine."
Homer,"We should have paid more attention to these side-effects. It's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea..."
Homer,"But how do we know, Marge? How do we know?"
Homer,"So I gave up tap for jazz, and I've never regretted it. And here's why..."
Homer,I'm on top of it.
Homer,"My God, is she brave. Standing up to that freaked-out junkie."
Homer,Why don't you just tell everybody?
Homer,The frame store! You monster!
Homer,And Mark McGwire gave you an autographed bat.
Homer,Who cares? That man can really slug.
Homer,"Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy's got it covered."
Homer,"God bless you, Nelson Muntz."
Homer,"Hey, you , you cut me off! Ah, yeah, you!"
Homer,"Oh, right. ambulance! Think you're so big with your siren, and your letters on backwards."
Homer,Here we are kids -- the zoo.
Homer,"If he's so smart, how come he's dead?"
Homer,Ooo... pointless nostalgia.
Homer,I'd sure hate to be him.
Homer,"Hey, I smell cake! Cake that says ""Farewell"" and ""Best Wishes""!"
Homer,I'll have you know I wandered off from the tour.
Homer,"Oh, I like food all right."
Homer,"I LIKE PIZZA / I LIKE BAGELS / I LIKE HOT DOGS, WITH MUSTARD AND BEER..."
Homer,"I'LL EAT EGGPLANT / I COULD EVEN EAT A BABY DEER... LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... WHO'S THAT BABY DEER ON THE LAWN, THERE..."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"No, it usually takes a few hours."
Homer,"Thanks for the chance. You won't never regret this, Mr. Editing Guy!"
Homer,"We don't need no stinkin' ""E"". Restaurant Review... No. Eatery Evaluation... No. Food box... Go or no go? By Homer... No. Earl. No. Bill Simpson!"
Homer,Well -- what do you think?
Homer,What's wrong with it?
Homer,It was so hard to get to 500 words...
Homer,"No, no, you're right. It's a joke. Everyone laugh at the funny joke . I'll be right back with the real review."
Homer,Still not clean! Stink of failure still on me!
Homer,Still not clean! Still not clean!
Homer,"Okay, what restaurant should we review?"
Homer,"Great. Now, let me think... the food was... not undelicious..."
Homer,"That's brilliant. And they have this sweet, sweet chocolate mousse -- really, the only word for it is ."
Homer,How about groin-grabbingly transcendent?
Homer,We make a good team. A groin-grabbingly good team!
Homer,"How about ""screw Flanders""?"
Homer,"Aw, they're both good."
Homer,Woo hoo! Stop the presses!
Homer,"Okay, start the presses!"
Homer,Whatever. I'll be at Moe's.
Homer,"Marge, shh! It's important that no one know that I'm a food critic."
Homer,"Can ya believe it, Marge? This job is the greatest -- they're paying me to eat!"
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. But this is only the beginning...
Homer,"There's the coffee mug from ""Heartbeeps""!"
Homer,Let me see.
Homer,Stupid script! Nearly wrecked Jim Carrey's career! You-- I'm gonna... What?
Homer,And the view is... beautiful... inspirational... nauseating.
Homer,"Look, Marge, I'm making a difference in people's lives!"
Homer,Are you gonna fire me for swiping office supplies?
Homer,Whew.
Homer,"Why, you... You made them cancel ""Platypus Man!"""
Homer,And the Cosby Mysteries! That show had limitless possibilities!
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"For you, perhaps."
Homer,I've given out my share of bad reviews.
Homer,It lost some points 'cause it had a Hot Wheel on it.
Homer,"Oh, that's classic."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Hm. This pea soup is as weak as the acting, and nowhere near as hammy."
Homer,The other critics told me to be mean. And you should always give in to peer pressure.
Homer,Always.
Homer,"Ah, not bad... if lasagna is Italian for ""pile of puke."""
Homer,"Well, I hope you cut me better than you did these string beans. Hm, I seem to be missing a piece of my ear. Touché!"
Homer,Mm.
Homer,"Sorry, Marge. I'm afraid this gets my lowest rating ever, seven thumbs up."
Homer,"Marge, I'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves: ""Shake"" and ""Bake."""
Homer,"People change, Marge. My palate has grown more sophisticated."
Homer,Oh... it's a special time in a boy's life when... Gotta go!
Homer,"So come to The Legless Frog... if you want to get sick and die, and leave a big, garlicky corpse. P.S. Parking was ample."
Homer,People will think what I tell them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!
Homer,"Nobody talks to me that way! I'm Homer Simpson! The most powerful food critic in town, who will never get his comeuppance! You hear me? No comeuppance! We'll be right back."
Homer,"I don't need Lisa to write a good review. ""The food at the Gilded Truffle really..."" Uh... What's a good word?"
Homer,"Sucks! That's great. ""And the bread was really..."" C'mon, help me out here."
Homer,"""Rough!"" Ah, I don't know. You've been pitching that all night."
Homer,Chewy! That's inspired.
Homer,Are you crazy? A dog can't type. Unfortunately.
Homer,Really? Like what?
Homer,"Oh, Marge, something bad usually happens to me when I go in anywhere."
Homer,A bat! Now that's a new one.
Homer,"So what are you up to, young lady?"
Homer,"Oh. Well, I'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me."
Homer,Pedestrian.
Homer,Uninspired.
Homer,I didn't say stop!
Homer,"Oh, So full... Bellybutton moving from innie to outie..."
Homer,"Ooh, sweet."
Homer,"Eh, I've had a good run."
Homer,Noooo!
Homer,"Oh, Lisa... you saved me! And after all the bad things I said about you."
Homer,"Oh, Lisa, the important thing is, I didn't get my comeuppance, and I never will."
Homer,"I know, honey. The important thing is -- run!"
Homer,Finally getting my comeuppance.
Homer,But it was worth it to get back our super Sugar Crisp cereal.
Homer,Can't get enough of that Sugar Crisp...
Homer,Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...
Homer,He's dead!
Homer,He's definitely dead!
Homer,"Don't worry. I've got a plan. Okay, Ned, the first thing we have to do is..."
Homer,To make sure that no one knows that you're dead. And if anyone asks... you're not dead.
Homer,Hey Maude! Look who's helping me clean the chimney.
Homer,"Hi, Maude. Diddily. I've been having fun with my pal Homer. Diddily."
Homer,"Relax, I'm fine. But when I do die, I don't want any autopsies."
Homer,"Wow, it sure is slippery up here."
Homer,"Aww, she missed it."
Homer,"Hey Maude, I'm home. Uh-oh. I think I'm having a heart attack."
Homer,And that's the end of that chapter.
Homer,Try not to look too sad -- it'll seem suspicious.
Homer,"When I think about Ned, I can't help but remember the look on his face when Marge drove over..."
Homer,"Oh, wait... What I'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. Anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife."
Homer,"We'll miss you, buddy."
Homer,"Hey, we just got away with murder. And it was so easy."
Homer,"You know, I've never liked that little wiener Milhouse."
Homer,But you got to kill...
Homer,Y'ello?
Homer,Who is this?
Homer,"No, it's Homer."
Homer,"Dear God, it's Homer. If you really love me, you'll save my life now."
Homer,"Okay, Marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement park."
Homer,"Lisa, the pet cemetery."
Homer,"Bart, spooky roller disco."
Homer,And I'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight.
Homer,"Now, Flanders, I want you to..."
Homer,"He's undead, all right."
Homer,Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...
Homer,"Hey, Foamy, I want the news, not the weather. Marge, did you hear me zing Werewolf Flanders?"
Homer,"Flanders, stop that."
Homer,"Eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie?"
Homer,"Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood."
Homer,Absolutely.
Homer,Doin' what now?
Homer,"That can't be true, honey. If it were, I'd be terrified."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. Let's just have some milk and go to bed..."
Homer,"Hey, this milk's broken."
Homer,Stop! Ow!
Homer,I'm caught on something!
Homer,But I was gonna loot you a present!
Homer,"Wonders, Lisa? Or blunders?"
Homer,"Implied, Lisa? Or implode?"
Homer,"Thank you, sweet clown."
Homer,In death you saved us all.
Homer,I can still hear his voice on the wind.
Homer,Just like the dead clown promised.
Homer,That's us!
Homer,"Certainly. I am... the, ah, piano genius from the movie ""Shine."""
Homer,Uh... Shiny McShine?
Homer,"Good-bye Lisa, remember me as I am... filled with murderous rage."
Homer,"Well, son. I guess this is the end. But we've both had long, full lives. Oh, right."
Homer,And there's nobody guarding it. Let's go!
Homer,I can't believe I destroyed the Earth.
Homer,You're right. I gotta let it go. All that counts is we're alive and rubbing elbows with the greats.
Homer,"Ooh, there's Ross Perot, Dr. Laura, Spike Lee..."
Homer,"Okay, but there's... Dan Quayle and Courtney Love... Tanya Harding... Al Sharpton...?"
Homer,Tom Arnold?! What the hell's going on?!
Homer,So we're all gonna die?
Homer,The sun? That's the hottest place on Earth!
Homer,"Oh no, Rosie O'Donnell."
Homer,"Ooo, you don't want to get Zorro mad."
Homer,Not fast enough!
Homer,I have to go to ze lobby!
Homer,"You're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either."
Homer,To the top please.
Homer,"Swim, my pretties."
Homer,Sh-sh-shh!
Homer,"Woo! You go, Zorro!"
Homer,Why that little... He insulted your honor!
Homer,"Sir, I demand satisfaction."
Homer,I challenge you to a duel.
Homer,"Will you duel, or are you a coward?!"
Homer,"Uh, uh. ""H"" is for Homer."
Homer,Heavyset? What's that supposed to mean?
Homer,"No Tommy Tune, eh? Oh, that's it. You insulted my honor."
Homer,I demand satisfaction! I challenge you to a duel.
Homer,Really? But you've never given anyone a free beer.
Homer,"Wow, a free beer! And I owe it all to a little glove slap. GLOVE SLAP..."
Homer,"BABY, GLOVE SLAP..."
Homer,Coming through... challenge... duel... Hi Lenny... how dare you... demand satisfaction...
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Aisle six?
Homer,Duelling at dawn? How did it ever come to this?
Homer,"Sir, that is an insult! I challenge you... What?"
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Oh, honey, I had the worst nightmare. This glove kept slapping people and I was getting blamed."
Homer,"He's out there, isn't he?"
Homer,"Hey, I'm not dead yet."
Homer,"Save me, Marge. I saved you!"
Homer,"Oh Marge, that's in the past. Just let it go."
Homer,And somebody wanted to get rid of it in April.
Homer,"Flanders, you gotta help me. Is there a southern couple parked in front of my house?"
Homer,"I was afraid of that. Well, goodbye, my gentle neighbor. You know, I've always wanted to tell you how mu..."
Homer,"Ah, screw it."
Homer,Ooh! How 'bout that house?
Homer,Lousy show-offs.
Homer,"Come on, Carter, build us a house, you lazy bum."
Homer,"Come on, move it!"
Homer,How should I know?
Homer,'Cause I'm trying to think! What would Zorro do?
Homer,Zo-rrooo!
Homer,Rural route 9? That's it! We can hide out at the farm where I grew up!
Homer,"Yeah, it'll be fun. Fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides..."
Homer,Race ya to the swimmin' hole!
Homer,"Com'on, Maw. Bring the young 'uns! There's no leeches! Lots of snakes, though."
Homer,Just think of 'em as cats with rabies.
Homer,"Hello, kitty."
Homer,You little scamp.
Homer,Absolutely. This is our big chance. The Simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.
Homer,That's my girl. Let the agriculture begin!
Homer,"All right, let's see what the old girl can do."
Homer,Hang on.
Homer,And... there.
Homer,Now we're talkin'!
Homer,Go get Lassie.
Homer,This car was made in Guatemala.
Homer,I bought these shoes from a hobo.
Homer,"I'm sorry, I believe in good grooming."
Homer,"Aw, what do you know?"
Homer,"Oh, that's just superstition."
Homer,You watch me. I'll grow something out there.
Homer,"Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that."
Homer,"Oh, a little bit of everything."
Homer,"Something will thrive in this harsh, merciless soil."
Homer,"And for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... I'm down."
Homer,Move the handbrake...
Homer,"Ohhh, that's heaven."
Homer,"Oh, it's been a month. Why won't anything grow?"
Homer,"I'm only one man, Marge."
Homer,"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm no farmer."
Homer,"Leave me alone, you big bully."
Homer,"Sorry, boy. Going back to Springfield would be a coward's way out."
Homer,"Oh, you're right. I'm a coward. I've made such a mess of things. If only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow..."
Homer,Wait a minute.
Homer,Easy... careful... steady...
Homer,Time to give Mother Nature a little goose.
Homer,"Well, Marge, have you ever seen a field glow like that?"
Homer,Of course not. But you know something? Sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart.
Homer,"Well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in hope."
Homer,"From the producers of ""Waiting to Exhale."""
Homer,Shut up and kiss me.
Homer,It's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop!
Homer,"That's all it takes. If we learned one thing from ""The Amazing Colossal Man,"" and ""Grasshopperus,"" it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast."
Homer,Only 'cause he tried to reason with him.
Homer,"Brace yourselves, everybody. You're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. You might want to crane your necks upward now to save time."
Homer,Ta-da!
Homer,"All right, now don't panic. It's possible the giant vegetables are invisible."
Homer,Ah-ha!
Homer,Oh... Where are you?
Homer,"Oh, you're right. This farm's hopeless. Why didn't I listen to those inbred hicks? I guess I'll just go hang myself in the barn."
Homer,This better be good.
Homer,A sprout!
Homer,And there's some more!
Homer,Who cares what it is? It's growing! I've saved the farm!
Homer,Look at my babies. This tomato will be Heinz ketchup. And this to-mah-to will be Hunt's catsup.
Homer,"Bup, no fighting, boys."
Homer,"Oh, great. I got a field full of mutants."
Homer,"Addictive, eh?"
Homer,"Aw, thanks honey."
Homer,"Yes, it's the latest craze. Try some, won't you?"
Homer,Don't push. There's plenty of tomacco for everyone.
Homer,"You're scaring the customers, honey."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Those dirty rotten...
Homer,"I wish I could make a difference, Lisa, but I'm just one man."
Homer,How much?
Homer,One hundred and... May I speak to my family for a moment?
Homer,"Did you see the way Emile's lookin' at Mindy? Hoo-hoo, I think something's going on there."
Homer,"Oh, yeah. Let's take it."
Homer,We all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult. The least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion.
Homer,They'll be back. We control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from...
Homer,Stop eating our future!
Homer,Get the... get outta... bad animals! Go home!
Homer,"Thank God, there's one left!"
Homer,"Look, a flying saucer!"
Homer,"There, there. We had quite a scare today. But you're gonna make us millions. Yes you are."
Homer,"I know, honey. But what can I do, as an individual? I wouldn't know where to begin."
Homer,"I agree, but how?"
Homer,They're after the tomacco!
Homer,"Lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is..."
Homer,"No, I'd rather die!"
Homer,Take it!
Homer,"So, Mindy? How did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million?"
Homer,Cash'll be okay! Or stock? Does your company have stock?
Homer,Mindy?
Homer,Mindy and I are just hammering out a payment plan. We'll talk Monday!
Homer,I don't know why we ever left in the first place.
Homer,"Hey, are we duellin' or what?"
Homer,I think so. The bone stopped the bullet.
Homer,After pie.
Homer,Snooze... need more snooze.
Homer,Did somebody say num num?
Homer,"Oh, I'm twenty-six hours late for work. No time for Maggie."
Homer,"Oooh, where's Waldo?"
Homer,"Nope. Nope. This would be a lot easier without all these people. Nope. Nope. It's there-- Uh, nope."
Homer,"Waldo, where are you?!"
Homer,Oh sure. Single me out.
Homer,Over there.
Homer,"Heh, heh. I'd hate to see the look on ol' Burnsie's face if he knew I was just gettin' in. Hee hee."
Homer,"Mmm, who is that? Big ugly nose... bald... liver spot... liver spot... Mmmm."
Homer,No! I can't get in trouble if I can't see you.
Homer,Safe in the core. And now...
Homer,This is the worst day ever.
Homer,Mr. Burns is making me eat all these drums of toxic waste.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Oh, Marge, I'm sorry. I can't make it."
Homer,The cooling tank just blew and they're taking Lenny to the hospital.
Homer,"Yeah, so I'm going to have to work late, instead of seeing you and the kids, which is what I really want."
Homer,Are poo and ass taken?
Homer,Damn! Could my life get any worse?!
Homer,"Hey, guys. Is it normal to see Burns' face on a bowling ball?"
Homer,What a rotten day!
Homer,Really?
Homer,Lenny...
Homer,Practice ball! Practice ball!
Homer,Real real real real real!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Woo hoo! I'm ten pins away from perfection.
Homer,Why won't they come over? I'm so lonely.
Homer,"Get down, get down, get down!"
Homer,Woo hoo! This is the greatest day of my life!
Homer,"In your face, to-do list!"
Homer,"Thank you! Thank you! But there was someone else with me on that alley. I'm talkin' about the big man, Carl."
Homer,"Thank you, Bart's teacher. You know, kids, my teachers said I would never amount to anything. And until last week, they were dead right. But now I've achieved perfection."
Homer,Any questions?
Homer,"Yes, Bart's weird friend."
Homer,You've got a father. He's just a dud.
Homer,Next question.
Homer,"Yes, the girl Bart has a crush on."
Homer,"Um, how 'bout one not touching your ass?"
Homer,"Hey, this was supposed to be about me. Now, any other questions? Pumpkin face? Headgear? Chicken pox? Smelly? Lazy eye? Spikey head? Okay, class dismissed. Rock on!"
Homer,"Yes, Kent?"
Homer,"Well... that would... uh, wait... uh... do I read from the sheet labeled ""Jokes"" or ""Answers?"""
Homer,"Dream on, Drunky!"
Homer,Flavor of the month? Me?
Homer,I 'unno... Because you weren't cute anymore?
Homer,"Eww, thanks for sharing!"
Homer,"Hello, everybody!"
Homer,Did somebody say a perfect game?
Homer,I'm doing a walk-on. It's a show business thing. So how y'all doin'? Let's see... What's in the news today?
Homer,"Hey, I thought you never talked."
Homer,"Remember Springfield, keep on swinging!"
Homer,"Hey, everybody! I'm gonna be on TV again."
Homer,That's right. You've got a special daddy.
Homer,"Woo hoo! First stop, Maude Flanders."
Homer,But she said I...
Homer,"Lisa, I know what's going on here. They did it to Jesus and now they're doing it to me."
Homer,"Well, in bowling ability."
Homer,Sweet bowling alley balloon. You're my only friend.
Homer,What was that about?
Homer,"Marge, has my life peaked?"
Homer,Mm-hmmm.
Homer,You're right!
Homer,"I can't believe it, Moe. The greatest feat of my life is already forgotten."
Homer,"Save your tears, Moe. Save 'em in a shot glass for someone who still has a shred of hope."
Homer,"THIS IS THE END / MY ONLY FRIEND, THE END / WEIRD SCENES INSIDE THE GOLD MINE..."
Homer,"Well, world, this is it. You know, I always thought you'd die before me. But now as I prepare my soul for an eternity of fire and poking..."
Homer,I wanna live!
Homer,It's a glandular problemmmm!
Homer,"Oooh, Morlocks... CHUDS... Mole People!"
Homer,"Oh, Lord... you saved me. I guess you had some higher purpose in mind."
Homer,"Not anymore, Ron. Now, I'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. Something noble, but easy."
Homer,That's great. Even big stars take their kids to the zoo.
Homer,That's it! Kids are the answer! I'll dedicate my life to my children.
Homer,No. I don't want your pity or your money.
Homer,I do what now?
Homer,"Listen, boy... I was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention."
Homer,I can see I'm not needed here.
Homer,"Lisa, honey, do you need any help with your homework?"
Homer,"I've been so blind. I'll lavish my attention on Maggie, the forgotten Simpson."
Homer,"Mag-gie. It's me, Dad-dy!"
Homer,Daddy's gonna spend a lot more time with you. Yes he is. Yes he is.
Homer,"Where's Mag-gie? Where's Mag-gie? Hey, where is she?"
Homer,There you are.
Homer,"Hi Maggie! I'm Homie-Womie, the Teletubby. And I'm all man, in case you've heard otherwise. Let's see what's on Tummy-vision!"
Homer,"Ow! Ow, that hurts! Owww! Ohhh!"
Homer,"Whee! Whee! Don't be scared, Maggie. Daddy won't drop you. Whee!"
Homer,"You're a tough cookie, Maggie, but I'm gonna win you over. Just like I did with Lisa."
Homer,"Hi, honey!"
Homer,"C'mon, Maggie. You can trust me."
Homer,Come to Daddy! Come to Daddy!
Homer,"I'm sorry, Maggie. I never realized things between us had gotten this bad."
Homer,What are you pointing at? The ocean?
Homer,That's a great idea. We'll swim in the ocean.
Homer,"See, Maggie. The ocean is just like a bathtub. Except instead of rubber ducks, it has barracudas and moray eels."
Homer,Nothing to worry about. Just a little wave.
Homer,"And this riptide is certainly nothing Daddy can't struggle against. Help! Help! Somebody, help!"
Homer,"Oh, current... too strong... I know! If I sink to the bottom I can run to the shore."
Homer,Maggie! Call Aquaman!
Homer,"Maggie, you're swimming! You swam out to save me."
Homer,"Oh, you do love me!"
Homer,"Actually, that was before I went in the ocean."
Homer,Then don't.
Homer,"Well, all I care about is that my little girl loves me. And we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on."
Homer,"Good girl, Maggie. You knocked down all the pins. But you stepped over the line just a little bit, so I'll have to give you a five."
Homer,And that gives you a final score of... two ninety-five.
Homer,"Looks like Daddy won, but two ninety-five is awfully good for a baby."
Homer,Yes it is. It's very good and you're a good little baby. Yes you are.
Homer,And these bean bag chairs look so comfortable.
Homer,"Hey, there's someone else in here."
Homer,He's named after what he is.
Homer,"Yes, I will have the... Pl_penlügen. And don't skimp on the D__dlemünch."
Homer,"Hey, Apu, Manjula. You guys are still married?"
Homer,"Pay up, Marge."
Homer,"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all."
Homer,"Hey Apu. Sittin' in the ice cream cooler, eh?"
Homer,"Whoa, too much information! Thanks for the mental picture. Why don't you tell us what you really think?"
Homer,"Could you be any more...? Hel-lo! Look, just give me some ice cream."
Homer,More than I wanted to knoooow!
Homer,But the cans seal in the flavor.
Homer,"So, how's the tribe comin' along? Any papooses?"
Homer,Decided? That's classic. Decided. Babies just happen.
Homer,Really? On top and underneath?
Homer,"Well, don't worry, I can help ya. I'm all about ideas."
Homer,"Kids, come and get it!"
Homer,"Now, this situation is guaranteed to end in pregnancy."
Homer,"Up-bup-bup-bup! That's an Apu question. You're ""Greg."""
Homer,My mistake. Stay in the moment.
Homer,And that's my cue to exit.
Homer,I just wanted to invite you to the wrap party. And that's my cue to exit.
Homer,"Man, the last nine months sure were crazy."
Homer,"Apu, you shoulda seen your face when they showed you those babies."
Homer,Yeah. It looked just like that.
Homer,Mine tasted like strawberry.
Homer,Mmm... Ovulicious.
Homer,"Free baby cola? Apu hits the jackpot, and I'm stuck with these useless one-tuplets."
Homer,I've been waiting so long to hear that.
Homer,"Ooh, look at that. Ooh, gingerbread house. Hansel and Gretel are set for life."
Homer,"Boy, that Hansel sure can eat."
Homer,My corneas! You were saying?
Homer,"Eight kids. Hm, I'm sterile, right baby doll?"
Homer,Beautiful.
Homer,"Apu? Manjula? Marge, I've got a bad feeling about this."
Homer,Marge... They've turned into jerks.
Homer,"No, Marge. No!"
Homer,"She's no Liza, but it works."
Homer,Don't worry. I brought some chloroform.
Homer,There... and... there...
Homer,"Okay, this is gettin' weird."
Homer,"Please, Mr. Kidkill, look into your heart. I know these babies have a lifetime contract. But what if I put together an even better act for you? Something sensational!"
Homer,Not any more!
Homer,"Okay, okay... don't panic. Release the mongoose!"
Homer,Stupid mongoose! get the snake! The snake! Do I look like a snake? Ow! Ow! He bit me Show's over! Show's over! Next show is eight o'clock and ten!
Homer,What an age we live in.
Homer,I remember television!
Homer,Nah. We'll go next month.
Homer,"Wow, look at this old-timey gizmo! I feel like I've gone back in a time machine."
Homer,What an age we live in.
Homer,"Oh, no. You're not gettin' me on that dance floor. Don't try and make me. If I have to get a divorce I will."
Homer,"That's right, never!"
Homer,Oh! I need a dance partner! What about you?
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,"It's mine. Finally, I've won the respect of my fellow... Get away from it!"
Homer,Promise you won't laugh?
Homer,I don't know how.
Homer,Will you teach me?
Homer,A gang! That's the answer.
Homer,"Remember to rebel against authority, kids."
Homer,"Quiet, Marge. The motorcycle and I are trying to sleep."
Homer,"I know, I know. Just tune her out."
Homer,"Yeah, that's the life for me, Marge. Cruisin' and hasslin' shopkeepers."
Homer,"Hey, don't make me hassle you, Lisa."
Homer,"You know, if you want to be in the gang, eventually you're gonna have to get motorcycles."
Homer,"This gang's for rebels, Flanders, not conformos."
Homer,"The first meeting of ""Hell's Satans"" is called to order."
Homer,"I'm the president and the decision is mine. We're Hell's Satans. Besides, I've already made our club jackets."
Homer,"Can't hassle us, pig. We're goin' the speed limit. Oink, oink, oink."
Homer,"You can lock us away, but you'll never defeat the Cobras."
Homer,Oink! Oink! Oink!
Homer,How could I be down a thousand bucks?
Homer,"And what if we don't, Pops?"
Homer,They printed my photo of our gang!
Homer,Carl looks great. Can't take a bad picture of that guy.
Homer,If you'd've been awake you would have said no. You can see the bind I was in.
Homer,You're the Hell's Satans? What a fun coincidence. My gang's name is also the...
Homer,Okay.
Homer,All right.
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,Done.
Homer,"Caps and frisbees, sir."
Homer,And some pogs.
Homer,"Hello, police? Can you send a SWAT team to 742 Evergreen Ter..."
Homer,But you have so much inner beauty.
Homer,You're done. Next!
Homer,"Okay, bikers, that's it. Benjamin Franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? They're gone! Woo hoo!"
Homer,... And those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look I get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.
Homer,"Yeah, someone really dropped the ball here. Marge? Marge?!"
Homer,Really? Read it.
Homer,"Oh, that's sweet."
Homer,"Now don't worry. I am gonna search high and low for your mother. But just in case I don't find her, I want you to contact this agency."
Homer,I just don't want to be alone.
Homer,"Excuse me, has anyone seen a woman wearing..."
Homer,That's more like it. I'm looking for...
Homer,I'll show you.
Homer,"Okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there. Long story short, my ""old lady"" was..."
Homer,"Oh, goodness. Mmm, some people never learn."
Homer,I guess I'll never find her.
Homer,"No! My wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. I took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"You and me, chopper to chopper."
Homer,Never! It was a gift from Newsweek!
Homer,Give me back my wife!
Homer,"Whaddaya say, honey?"
Homer,No dice!
Homer,Taking care of some unfinished business.
Homer,Go! Go! Go!
Homer,"Hey, why is this door locked?"
Homer,What's going on? And I want the non-gay explanation.
Homer,"Oh, thank God."
Homer,Where are the refreshments?
Homer,Maybe you should shut up.
Homer,"Forget it. He releases the hounds on every charity that comes to his door: Feed the Children, Save the Whales, even Release the Hounds."
Homer,"Get 'em, boy. Hit those smart-ass books."
Homer,"Uhh. Is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open the door and everything's normal, and we think you're crazy, but then there really is a killer robot and the next morning you find me impaled on a weather vane? Is that what this is, Lisa?"
Homer,"So, who am I beating up?"
Homer,"Now, let's see. This will make three Christmases I saved versus eight I ruined... two were kind of a draw..."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,Writhing Funzos / In my sack / Makes me happy / Makes me hurt my back...
Homer,Hah! If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that...
Homer,"Please, Mr. Coleman. We can explain."
Homer,"Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics."
Homer,I think what Lisa meant to say is...
Homer,"Hey, it is Christmas. We'd better get home."
Homer,"Um, uh... Mr. Coleman, I've been thinking... My wife always makes too much stuffing and sweet p'taters and all, and... Aw, heck! Would you like to spend Christmas with us?"
Homer,I like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.
Homer,Get her! She's doing something!
Homer,Our junk!
Homer,And the exits are sealed! Go to plan B!
Homer,Come on!
Homer,Oh no you don't!
Homer,"Oh, precious heirlooms! Daddy would never let them take you."
Homer,Oh. That was scary. We came this close to losing our spare Christmas tree stand. You monster.
Homer,Useless? This flash cube has two flashes left!
Homer,"Hey, let's go skiing right now!"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Where?!
Homer,"Hmmm... ""The Widowmaker,"" Oh, that one's for the ladies. ""Spinebuster,"" boring. Ooh, ""Colostomizer."""
Homer,Don't hurt me! Here's my wallet.
Homer,Flanders!
Homer,"That suit's a little revealing, isn't it?"
Homer,Quit it! Must wash eyes! J--
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Okay, don't panic. Remember what the instructor said..."
Homer,Stupid sexy Flanders!
Homer,"Ow, my legs! This is the worst pain ever..."
Homer,Single.
Homer,You missed all the fun.
Homer,I want my wife to get the best treatment money can buy.
Homer,Whoa-whoa-whoa! Don't go nuts.
Homer,Uh... better than that.
Homer,Perfect.
Homer,"We'll be fine, honey. The main thing is for you to get better."
Homer,Take that! Woo! Woo! H-Hey! Hey!
Homer,Gotcha! Gotcha! / I'll show you!
Homer,"And you're ""interferon"" with our good time!"
Homer,'Mornin'...
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,"I guess, or one of her friends."
Homer,"Come on, ""bikini inspector!"" ""Scrub toilet?"" Okay, that was a practice. Practice... Practice... Okay, here we go. ""Feed fish."""
Homer,"Oh, it's a great hat. No one's questioning the hat."
Homer,"Lisa, I'll do the dishes when I pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. See, there it is. But that was a practice. The system works!"
Homer,"C'mon, eat, you lazy fish."
Homer,"Oh, but Lenny just got some bottle rockets."
Homer,"That's not true, he left it on the bus."
Homer,"Lisa, help!"
Homer,I got the groceries!
Homer,It's the bread of astronauts.
Homer,Oh yeah. You were way off.
Homer,"Hello, Lollipop Island? There's a little girl here who had too many sourballs."
Homer,"Anyway, where were we? Hello? Hello? They hung up."
Homer,Marco!
Homer,Marco!
Homer,Marc--
Homer,"Sweetie, if we didn't turn it down for the cops, what chance do you have? He hit her again."
Homer,Jesus?
Homer,"Lisa, help!"
Homer,What's wrong with us?!
Homer,"You don't? 'Cause that's what I said! Tell her, Bart."
Homer,Yes...
Homer,Yes! Yesssss!
Homer,"Help us, Virtual Doc! Look at me! I'm on my knees!"
Homer,Leprosy? I can't believe it! That fortune cookie was right.
Homer,Mops? The cure sounds worse than the disease.
Homer,"Well, I think we're on the outs with Him, but I know someone who's even holier than Jesus."
Homer,Use your brains to help us. Your delicious brains.
Homer,"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! You wonderful man!"
Homer,Bart! Leave some for Rod and Todd!
Homer,"Here you go, lad."
Homer,So you're shunning us.
Homer,"Oh, thank you good sir."
Homer,"That it is. We'll take the cure, bag a few lobsters, then watch some gay guys get married."
Homer,Howdy. And thanks for not recoiling in horror.
Homer,Really? The whole beach?
Homer,Electric needle room?!
Homer,I figured it out after I ate one of my chest sores.
Homer,"This place is a blast. All we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then it's nothin' but shopping and surfing."
Homer,"Come on, loosen up. This is paradise."
Homer,That's me!
Homer,Aloha / Aloha Until we meet a-
Homer,"Bill, bill. Oooh! Llib! Eh-- Wait a minute. Bill?!"
Homer,"Huh? Springfield University Homecoming! Finally, a chance to relive my golden college years..."
Homer,"Remember my love affair with Ali McGraw? She used to call me ""Preppy."" Then she died."
Homer,Then the big game between Springfield U. and Springfield A & M. I hate Springfield U. so much.
Homer,So much.
Homer,"My old dorm room. Come on, baby, let's matriculate."
Homer,"My old roommates, the nerds. Ya workin'?"
Homer,One million times...
Homer,"... Yeah, so because of me, all the dorms now have security phones."
Homer,Make me.
Homer,Okay. All right. Okay.
Homer,I'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a ruse to get our money.
Homer,Have you nerds forgotten everything I taught you? This calls for a prank. I see a bucket...
Homer,"Oh, this is gonna be so great."
Homer,"So when Dean Peterson opens his door, this bucket of Super Glue is gonna drop right on his head..."
Homer,He-- What the?!
Homer,"Oh, real original. Who did this?"
Homer,"Oh, that's it. You're through, dean!"
Homer,Now who's the dean?
Homer,"Oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? Oh, there's no such thing."
Homer,What guys? I wanna see the freaks.
Homer,Easy... easy...
Homer,Too far.
Homer,What? I can see fine.
Homer,That had nothing to do with the bucket.
Homer,Cure me! Cure me!
Homer,Yeah. And I got a bucket on my head!
Homer,I see the light! It burns!
Homer,"Uh, Miracle Boy?"
Homer,"I believe I had hair. Oh, here they are."
Homer,I can't come up with an idea for my homecoming float. Do it for me.
Homer,Look at Moe dance! ALOHA MOE...
Homer,"Yeah, you're right."
Homer,It's not to scale.
Homer,And chili fries!
Homer,Can't make a float without flowers.
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Woo hoo! Go S.U.!
Homer,"Yeah, well you went to a cow college!"
Homer,"Okay, who needs another lamb rack?"
Homer,Lisa? Ham hock? Tri tip?
Homer,"Well, I think the veal might have died of loneliness..."
Homer,"Oh, you just know what everyone should do, don't you, Marge?"
Homer,I forgot my float!
Homer,"Quick, pass me down!"
Homer,Wait! Hang on!
Homer,"Wait! Wait! I got a float too! Listen up, 'cause I gotta explain a lot of it!"
Homer,Boo?
Homer,"Out of the way, Baryshnikov!"
Homer,"Oh, I only wanted to show my school spirit."
Homer,"No, wait! I got a kid who's a miracle worker! He'll heal him up real good."
Homer,Or else what?
Homer,"Oh, right. The ice pick."
Homer,"Bart, I need a miracle!"
Homer,"Please, Bart. You've gotta use your powers! I'm beggin' ya!"
Homer,"Bart, do your thing!"
Homer,Poor guy. He lost his leg.
Homer,"This is my year, Marge. Everyone knows I'm what makes this city great."
Homer,Wha...?!
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,Everyone gets an award but me.
Homer,"Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?"
Homer,I mean an award that's worth winning.
Homer,"What's that, sonny?"
Homer,"Well, that was a great night for us all."
Homer,Nothing you can say will diminish this honor.
Homer,"Look at me, I'm a billionaire!"
Homer,And the bed never needs to be made. Check it out.
Homer,Wasteful AND practical.
Homer,"A mechanical dressing dealy! Watch this, Marge."
Homer,Now I'm ready to hit the town.
Homer,I'm drunk!
Homer,Look how loud I have to yell!
Homer,"Why, Marge, I believe you're supposed to scratch your ass with it."
Homer,"Oops, forgot to swirl it."
Homer,"Jimmy is such an ugly word, Marge. Unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits."
Homer,"Listen, I worked long and hard for this place. And no one's going to take it away from me. Not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody."
Homer,And another thing: If I ev...
Homer,"Operator, get me Thailand. T...i... and so on."
Homer,"Everybody. I found Burnsie's address book. I called the New York Yankees and told them to bunt, and then I called the Queen of England and asked her how it was going, and then I..."
Homer,"Just a second, Marge. Hello! Thailand? How's everything on your end? Uh-huh. That's some language you got there. And you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh?"
Homer,Hey!
Homer,"Geez, way to burst my bubble, Marge."
Homer,"Marge, you're right. We do have to have a party."
Homer,What about partays?
Homer,Damn!
Homer,And I looked so good on that box.
Homer,"Havin' a party, Moe. I'll need four kegs of your finest imported-sounding beer."
Homer,"Mmmm, Danish."
Homer,"Huh? If you can't sell beer, what are Lenny and Carl doing here?"
Homer,But I need that beer now.
Homer,"What's that, a theme park?"
Homer,"They were so drunk. Gentlemen, get off your knees. Your rich uncle Homer is throwing the wildest box social the high seas have ever seen!"
Homer,And you're invited.
Homer,"Marge, you know I normally listen to you, but I've gotta seize this opportunity. Just in case I never become a real billionaire."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Propellers... SPINNING! Turn... LEFT! Boat go... THERE!
Homer,Ships ahoy!
Homer,"Well done, Mr. Lenny. Well done."
Homer,"We made it, son. International waters -- the land that law forgot."
Homer,That's right. See that ship over there?
Homer,"They're rebroadcasting Major League Baseball with implied oral consent, not expressed written consent! Or so the legend goes."
Homer,There are no laws. We can do anything we want! Anything!
Homer,"Ow, ow! Oh, real mature, Lenny."
Homer,Look at those poor saps back on land. With their laws and ethics. They'll never know the simple joys of a monkey knife fight.
Homer,"C'mon, Bart. The Coast Guard is covering the Doobs!"
Homer,Who's the greatest billionaire in the world?!
Homer,Pirates! Are you friendly pirates?
Homer,What have you done with my party guests?
Homer,Third best for me.
Homer,"Help, pirates!"
Homer,"Oh, bless you!"
Homer,"Oh, that would be just... You're just yankin' my chain, aren't you?"
Homer,I don't wanna!
Homer,Ah ha! Prepare to die!
Homer,You too.
Homer,Agh! Rope burns!
Homer,"Oooh, oooh, Charlie horse, Charlie horse!"
Homer,"Agh, my mouth!"
Homer,"In the net, right?"
Homer,"Shut up, Net Face."
Homer,"I said shut up, Net Face!"
Homer,Ahhhh!
Homer,That was my plan all along. Now relax and the currents will take us home.
Homer,"They're the greatest heroes of all. Hey, something's clawing at my leg. Okay, it stopped."
Homer,"Uh, Mr. Burns, pirates got your yacht."
Homer,"I don't know. After living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump."
Homer,"That's right. Just because we're not rich, doesn't mean that we don't have... Oh, I can't even finish. I wanna be rich!"
Homer,"Like these guys. And look at all these rich people here. Not as rich as they should be of course. But still rich. All that big money. Look at all of these. Got all this money. I have lots of money. Oh look at all the other people. Oh, look at all the people who can buy and sell me. I should send a list of these names to the IRS. I'm takin' 'em all down. Oh, look at all the rich people. Oh, look at the rich..."
Homer,"Don't shush me, you rich bastards!"
Homer,Good luck gettin' a horse to eat dog food.
Homer,Vietnam Veteran.
Homer,"I.D.? Man, Charlie didn't ask for I.D. when I fought at La Choy and Chun King. I saw my best friend's head explode at Margaret Cho."
Homer,"Why should I? Did my country give me a parade? No, man! They spat at me and..."
Homer,Thanks. This closes the saddest chapter in American history.
Homer,"It's B.T.O.! They're Canada's answer to E.L.P. Their big hit was ""T.C.B."" That's how we talked in the '70s. We didn't have a moment to spare."
Homer,Takin' Care of Business!
Homer,"No talking! No new crap! ""Takin' Care of Business!"" Now!"
Homer,"Get to the ""workin' overtime"" part!"
Homer,Work out!
Homer,"Play ""Ain't Seen Nothing Yet!"""
Homer,What-everrr!
Homer,I stand by my disappointed groan.
Homer,"Look, Lisa. It glows. Oooo."
Homer,"See, Marge? I told you they could deep-fry my shirt."
Homer,Anybody care what this guy thinks?
Homer,Tunnel!
Homer,"But he'll bring us joy, Marge. Unlike all your silly gewgaws."
Homer,"Marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. But don't worry, I have a way for Duncan to earn his keep."
Homer,"Mmm, that's terrific, Duncan. You're ten for ten. Now, let's look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the NFL."
Homer,"Pearls, eh?"
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Racehorse, eh?"
Homer,"Son, I learned everything I needed to know from ""The Horse Whisperer"". Step One: Seduce a lonely housewife."
Homer,Ma'am.
Homer,Now for the actual horse whispering.
Homer,"When the race starts, run really fast!"
Homer,"Champion horse, coming through!"
Homer,Good horse. Here's one taco and you'll get another when you win.
Homer,"Hey, where do you get those metal dealies for his feet?"
Homer,"Hey, what's with the attitude? I just want some dealies."
Homer,He ran all the way here.
Homer,"You can do it, Duncan. I don't care if your odds are... Five million to one!?"
Homer,"That horse better win, or we're taking a trip to the glue factory and he won't get to come."
Homer,"Cheer up, son. I thought you looked damn good out there. Oh, wait. You were number ""5""? Eew! You stin... Damn good."
Homer,"Well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. We're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. All those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies."
Homer,"Not anymore. Ladies, say hello to..."
Homer,Possessions are fleeting.
Homer,Woo hoo! In your little faces!
Homer,"Man, I got more trophies than Wayne Gretzky and the Pope combined."
Homer,I've been waiting all my life to hear that.
Homer,"Hey, where'd you go?... Little man?"
Homer,What happened?!
Homer,What is this place?!
Homer,Why are you talking like that?
Homer,But you're respected athletes! You own car dealerships and marry beauty queens.
Homer,What do you want me to do?
Homer,MY HORSE MUST LOSE?
Homer,AND WHAT IF I REFUSE TO LOSE?
Homer,MY HORSE MUST LOSE!
Homer,Did that really happen? Or was it just a wonderful dream?
Homer,"Son, don't ask why, but you have to lose the big race."
Homer,"Oh, it is, it is. But we've been pushing that poor horse too hard."
Homer,"Well, it is a good life, believe me... All right, we'll give it a shot. I'll deal with those murderous trolls."
Homer,"I mean, I'll deal with those murderous trolls."
Homer,"Go, son! Do it for the normals!"
Homer,I can't stress enough how easy it was to win this prestigious race. And furthermore...
Homer,Hollywood-is-leading-our-kids-down-a-moral-sewer-Gotta-go!
Homer,"Nah, we're cool."
Homer,"Marge, now!"
Homer,"Son, go get me a trash bag."
Homer,"Now that you're a champion, you'll have your pick of the fillies."
Homer,"Yeah, she's the best. Ooo, can you imagine her face on her body?"
Homer,But what if I have to do my business?
Homer,How come bears can crap in the woods and I can't?
Homer,Bees!
Homer,"Okay, nobody panic. There's plenty of spray for me."
Homer,"No they didn't. They just surrounded it with something wonderful -- like a raisin covered in chocolate, or a monkey in a cowboy suit."
Homer,See? Animals can get used to anything.
Homer,"Better do what he says, Marge."
Homer,We can hike anytime. This is our chance to see cars driving.
Homer,Flanders? Since when do you like anything cool?
Homer,"Be patient, son. A rushed car never crashes."
Homer,"Oh, I missed one!"
Homer,"Let's go! New tires! C'mon, c'mon!"
Homer,"Oh, how rude of me. My name is..."
Homer,My bad.
Homer,Finally!
Homer,I need a shirt! Gimme a shirt!
Homer,"That's a damn lie, and you know it! Gimme a shirt!"
Homer,"Hey, T-shirt- T-shirt-T-shirt!"
Homer,"Oooh, a bobby pin."
Homer,"And poor Ned didn't get a chance to say goodbye. Well, from now on I'm never gonna let you leave the room without telling you how much I love you and how truly special... this is really eating up a lot of time. Maybe just a pat on the butt. Yeah, that works."
Homer,I know. No more being a jerk.
Homer,Finally.
Homer,Quit hogging Flanders. I want to comfort him.
Homer,Then I insist on walking you home.
Homer,"Those feelings are normal, Ned. They're part of the process. Watch the sprinkler."
Homer,"It's natural to feel that way, but the sprinkler is gone. It's time to let go."
Homer,"I know, I know. It's never easy."
Homer,You want anything else? Water? Chili fries? How about some white noise?
Homer,"Sleep tight, Neddie."
Homer,"What the... Oh, you want a rock fight, eh?"
Homer,"Okay, be right down."
Homer,"Yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd said ""I love you,"" or ""you're special."" You know, something sweet instead of that hot dog crack."
Homer,"Now, now, now. Don't beat yourself up. I'm the one who drove her out of her seat. I'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts. I'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation..."
Homer,"But, uh, there's no point in playing the blame game."
Homer,"Easy answer, eh?"
Homer,"Oh, yeah. That's it, baby, that's the money shot. Yeah, the camera loves you. Oh-ho-ho, you tease, you."
Homer,You'll see...
Homer,I think it's pretty obvious that I don't.
Homer,"Okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot of Flanders paying his bills..."
Homer,Then we star-wipe to Flanders brushing his...
Homer,Why eat hamburger when you can have steak?
Homer,"So, how're you doing, Ned?"
Homer,"Well, that's all gonna change, thanks to this tape..."
Homer,"Now, the audio needs some tweaking, and there's some footage of Maggie being born that I couldn't get rid of... Anyway, enjoy."
Homer,"Single women of Springfield, your prayers have been Flanswered."
Homer,"Ned Flanswered, that is."
Homer,Shush.
Homer,What would you say about a man who owns his own house...
Homer,And his own car? That's Ned Flanders.
Homer,A man who's not afraid to cry.
Homer,"Hey, Ned."
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Ned does everything with class. Whether he's punching in his ATM code...or keeping clean in the shower...
Homer,But don't take my word for it. Listen to this testimonial.
Homer,So if you're tired of dating the same old losers...
Homer,"...Step up to the best. Ned Flanders, the man with the chest."
Homer,"Now, we'll just send this to the dating service, the chicks'll fall for you, and bam! The healing begins."
Homer,"Oh-ho-ho-ho, that's great. Chicks really dig sensitivity. Did you get that, Bart?"
Homer,"Beautiful! And star-wipe, aaaand we're out."
Homer,Hello? Mailman?
Homer,"Oh, wake up, Ned. You think Maude isn't dating in heaven?"
Homer,"How could she not? The place is full of eligible bachelors -- John Wayne, Tupac Shakur, Sherlock Holmes..."
Homer,He sure is!
Homer,"So how'd you do tonight, Romeo?"
Homer,"That's right, Ned. Those floozies we married in Vegas were crazy about you."
Homer,"Marge, we're trying to help Ned."
Homer,"I toileth not on ye Sabbath, woman! A pox on thee."
Homer,"Hey, I'm as surprised as you, but I've stumbled upon the most delicious British sit-com."
Homer,"It's about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. If they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker."
Homer,The Mother's the voice of reason.
Homer,"Hey, what the hell's going on?!"
Homer,You're mad? Where's my show!?
Homer,Finally.
Homer,Why are you torturing me? I'm just a man.
Homer,"Well, why didn't you say so?"
Homer,"Yes, I'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars to get them to shut up. From... anonymous."
Homer,Done and done.
Homer,"Eh, how're they gonna find me?"
Homer,"Oh, why did I register with Insta-trace?"
Homer,"Uh-oh. You've gotta help me, Bart."
Homer,"That's it, boy! Go get help!"
Homer,"Okay Homer, don't panic. Let me do the talking."
Homer,"Umm... It's an honor to give ten thousand dollars, especially now, when the rich mosaic of cable programming has made public television so very, very unnecessary."
Homer,Will cash be okay?
Homer,"Well, then we've got a problem. The banks are closed by now."
Homer,"Maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours, but we in Springfield are simple folk. We like our cars fast, and our banks closed. Okay, fine, we'll go down there. But they're not going to be open."
Homer,"Yeah, it's a real ghost town in there."
Homer,"I'd like to withdraw ten thousand dollars, please."
Homer,I'll pay you later.
Homer,"Uh, why, no. Uh... Everything is just..."
Homer,I can't do it. I can't kill a man!
Homer,Mm-mm.
Homer,Mm-hmm.
Homer,The Hooligans!
Homer,Bingo!
Homer,Sanctuary!
Homer,Sanctuary!
Homer,Quick! You've got to hide me from PBS! Their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the Chubb Group!
Homer,Please help me! I'll do anything! I'll light a candle! I'll help with your next charity scam!
Homer,"Sure, sure, Bob's your uncle. Let's just get outta here!"
Homer,"Great, but why am I on a plane?"
Homer,South Pacific?! I didn't agree to...
Homer,Wha -- Wait! I'm no missionary! I don't even believe in Jebus! Let me out!
Homer,"Oh, save me Jebus!"
Homer,"Jebus, where are you?! Homer to Jebus!"
Homer,Hmm... This doesn't look so bad.
Homer,"Aww. Hi there, little fella."
Homer,"You're leaving? Wait, what do I do here?"
Homer,Done.
Homer,Me Homer. Me hiding from PBS.
Homer,Here you go. Knock yourself out.
Homer,"Does the word ""jet-lag"" mean anything to you people? ""Jet-laggg""."
Homer,"Oh, yes. Very much so."
Homer,"No, I'm good."
Homer,"Hey, what happened to all the shirtless girls you see in all the geographical magazines?"
Homer,What was that?
Homer,Great. Now my testicle's got ants on it.
Homer,"Thanks, sweetheart. Have a Bible. My name's Homer. What's yours?"
Homer,"I'm gonna call you Lisa Junior. So, what do you do for fun around here?"
Homer,"Craig and Amy, Craig and Amy. Why don't you just marry Craig and Amy?"
Homer,"So, how's the TV reception here? Excellent, or...?"
Homer,You don't have TV? But what will I watch while I'm sitting on the couch?
Homer,"No couches either? Oh, man. I need a beer."
Homer,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!"
Homer,Nothin'.
Homer,Here we go. Ee-yeah.
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"I guess so, but that first month was pretty rough."
Homer,"Really? Without TV, it's hard to know when one day begins and the other ends."
Homer,"Mmm, I can see the house is falling apart without me, so here's the new order: Bart, you're the man of the house. Lisa -- I'm promoting you to boy. Maggie's now the brainy girl. The toaster can fill in for Maggie. And Marge, you're a consultant."
Homer,"Yes, boy?"
Homer,Really? You're proud of me?
Homer,"Oh, really? Well, if you'll excuse me, I've got some civilization to spread like butter on the English muffin that is these people, with all their little nooks and crannies..."
Homer,"Well, I'm not not licking toads... Well, it's time to get to work. Humanitarian Homer Simpson, over and out."
Homer,"Gather 'round, everyone! I'm going to teach you about religion."
Homer,"Please, please, that's not necessary. I'm just God's messenger."
Homer,"And lo, what a wondrous message it is:"
Homer,"Like this, from the Book of P-salms: ""God will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who walk in their guilty ways. That you may bathe your feet in blood."" As true today as it was when it was written."
Homer,"Now, let's open it up to some Q & A."
Homer,"Yes, Lisa Junior?"
Homer,"Well, not the Unitarians. If that's the one true faith, I'll eat my hat."
Homer,"Well, Ak, it's because God is powerful, but also insecure, like Barbra Streisand, before James Brolin. Oh, he's been a rock."
Homer,"Oh, who am I kidding? The truth is, I'm no missionary. I work in a nuclear power plant."
Homer,"Look, the point is, I want to help, but you don't need a well, or a chapel, or an immunization center. What you need's a little razzle dazzle. Qtoktok, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Homer,"Hey, that's great. Now let's get to work!"
Homer,"Now, if ""The Flintstones"" has taught us anything, it's that pelicans can be used to mix cement."
Homer,"Come on little friend, make a wisecrack. You know, ""it's a living,"" that sort of thing."
Homer,Oopsie.
Homer,"Friends -- when I came here one month ago, this seemed like a strange and frightening place. But now I've learned to love this island as my second..."
Homer,A plane! Stop! Get me off this stinking rock!
Homer,"Anyhoo, I'm about to share with you a modern-day miracle. Something that has revitalized cities from East St. Louis to Biloxi, Mississippi. The magic medicine of... casino gambling!"
Homer,It could be you!
Homer,"Check it out. There's Island Blackjack, Island Craps, Island Texas Hold 'em... But if, like me, you're mesmerized by pretty colors and spinning things, you'll prefer roulette. Four sand dollars on number six, please."
Homer,"So, how you doin'? Stayin' out of trouble?"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Now, over here I've brewed up my favorite beverage: beer. It's mostly Dristan and holy water, but it does the job."
Homer,"So have fun everybody. And who knows? Maybe you'll hit the jackpot, get off this island, and spend the rest of your days in a tropical paradise."
Homer,"Oh, you should've seen their faces, honey. Now I know how Bob Stupak feels."
Homer,Is everybody happyyyyy?
Homer,"Oh, my God."
Homer,"Oh, what happened?! I gave you a glittering Vegas, and you turned it into a skanky Atlantic City!"
Homer,Because you're all terrible sinners.
Homer,Since I got here. Now either grab a stone or go to Hell.
Homer,"Well, I may not know much about God, but I have to say, we built a pretty nice cage for Him."
Homer,"Not bad, Lisa Junior. But God's palace is way up on the moon...so if we want Him to hear us, we've gotta crank up the volume."
Homer,"Do you hear me, Lord?! Homer's doing your work! I'm the greatest missionary of all time! Of all time!"
Homer,"Oh, no! This looks like the end!"
Homer,Fire! Fire!
Homer,Fire!
Homer,Get in! Move it! This is not a drill!
Homer,"Good work, everyone. We're sure to be first in line for Duff Days."
Homer,I know. I'm a character. Now a little beer music to get in the mood.
Homer,Looking for these? Dee-dee-dee.
Homer,"Twist off, dammit!"
Homer,Go Moe! Boo everyone else!
Homer,"Ahhh, you can really taste the goat."
Homer,"All right, guys. One, two, three."
Homer,"Moo?! Lenny, you were supposed to be ""E""."
Homer,That one.
Homer,"Aw, Maggie wants a balloon and daddy will take a hand stamp so he can get back in."
Homer,Just kidding. Remember my face.
Homer,"Moe, the new Duff calendars are out! The ones with your picture!"
Homer,"Oh, Moe. There's lots of people uglier than you. Like, you ever been to White Castle?"
Homer,Caveman brow...
Homer,"C'mon, Moe. Don't feel bad. There's too much emphasis on looks these days. That's why they won't let Bill Maher on TV before midnight."
Homer,"Well, it's time to get some closure. Extreme closure."
Homer,"Hurry, hurry up! I have to pee!"
Homer,"Okay, now do Moe."
Homer,"Yeah, but just for a minute. It's a funny story; I'll tell you sometime."
Homer,"Oh, you dear, dear man. You're one of us beautiful people now. And your new life begins today."
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,Run!
Homer,You're gonna get even with that lottery guy that never picks our numbers.
Homer,Whatever.
Homer,"Hey, Moe. Beer me!"
Homer,Hmm. This isn't nearly as complicated as Moe made it seem.
Homer,"You don't love me. The only thing you love is your ear, nose and throat pavilion."
Homer,"That was amazing, Moe. I'm actually a little turned on."
Homer,I know what you mean. Our dog had that.
Homer,The one with the amulet?
Homer,"What? Let me see that! ""Interior Coroner's Office. Close-up on Dr. Winslow's mangled corpse. Coroner: 'Let's get that brain out and weighed, and call it a day.'"" Yep, that does sound kinda bad."
Homer,Ding-dong!
Homer,Dr. Winslooooow...
Homer,I am an angel from the future.
Homer,You're going to die in a skydiving accident.
Homer,Gabriella's baby shower will be invaded by terrorists. With sexy results.
Homer,"Well, Sister Bernadette will leave the convent and start a softball team. With sexy results."
Homer,...and only then do we find out that Professor Gallaway's half-sister is plotting to take over International Perfume and Wine.
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,"I'm sorry about your face, Moe."
Homer,"Yeah, you were..."
Homer,"Let's see... Judging from the bug build-up, we're gettin' close."
Homer,What?
Homer,All right! Geez...
Homer,God bless Native America.
Homer,"Let's go, Marge. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!"
Homer,"Well, what better place to celebrate your recovery than amidst the frenzied excitement of the casino floor? Lisa?"
Homer,Sure we can't talk you into it?
Homer,"Sorry, son. Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian."
Homer,"HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA."
Homer,Bleh. This virtual fudge tastes like crap.
Homer,"Oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!"
Homer,"Right, right, present. Anyway, can I get you some Soylent Green?"
Homer,"Oh, here we go."
Homer,"Oh, I'm tired of giving you money. Why can't you be more like Lisa?"
Homer,You should've thought of that before you dropped out of the DeVry Institute.
Homer,I'm still cool.
Homer,"Well, I do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see it. Oh, you can."
Homer,She knows what time dinner is.
Homer,Searched for Lincoln's gold.
Homer,Then what is his ghost protecting?
Homer,... four score and four... four score and five... four score and six... four score and seven paces.
Homer,I started what from a what?
Homer,"Gold bars discovered by Marge? Zero. Gold bars discovered by Homer? Well, let's just see..."
Homer,"Oops, sorry, honey."
Homer,Shut up.
Homer,"Marge, I did it! I found Lincoln's gold!"
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy..."
Homer,"That lying , rail-splitting , theater-going freak!"
Homer,"Ah, trash night. In France, they call it ""La Nuit Des Poubelles."" In Germany, it's ""Crappenfest."""
Homer,"Quit gabbin' and start grabbin'. And remember, the best stuff is usually deep in the garbage juice."
Homer,See? A new pacifier for Maggie.
Homer,Especially when we send it to him piece by piece.
Homer,"Shh, quiet."
Homer,"Well, this muscle shirt's a pretty good find."
Homer,"All I know is, I'm finally getting the support I need."
Homer,"Hey, Vinnie, how's about a pizza? I got-a no job."
Homer,Mama mia. Look what the Hawaiian restaurant threw out!
Homer,Get outta my dreams and into my car.
Homer,Hey Flanders? Can your God do that?
Homer,I'll be at Moe's.
Homer,I threw you a party at my house.
Homer,"You wish. That's the stage we call ""Professor Barney"" -- talkative, coherent, even insightful. Here's drunk."
Homer,"Marge, you're making a complete fool of yourse... Oh, it's just Barney."
Homer,Disgracefully hilarious! You passed out before we could even give you your presents.
Homer,"Wait a minute, Barney. You gotta be sober to fly. I mean, it's not like drivin' a car."
Homer,"Barney, didn't you say you were gonna stop drinking?"
Homer,You came to the right guy. I'll straighten ya out... right after I finish this beer.
Homer,"Ah, man that's sweet. Okay, let's go."
Homer,Oh. My name is Homer and I'm planning a trip to St. Louis.
Homer,Is there any other St. Louis?
Homer,Not a chance. I can sink way lower. I just came to help my friend Barney.
Homer,The sugar cookies you speak of. Are they real or symbolic?
Homer,I don't wanna walk that far. Anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing. Get it? Huh? Twelve? Steps.
Homer,Hey? How did I get out here?
Homer,But that's Barney's seat. Are you tryin' to make me the new Barney?
Homer,"Well, forget it, guys. I am not Barney!"
Homer,Okay...
Homer,"If I didn't, I'd lose their respect."
Homer,"Can I, Marge? Can I?"
Homer,So you missed some big changes at Moe's. He hangs newspapers over the urinals now. You can read the sports page while you pee. Very la-di-da.
Homer,Wasted? What about our staring contests? And the way we always knew what football coaches should've done? Remember the day we jumped that Census guy and stole his clicker?
Homer,"Oh, so you're better than me, is that it?"
Homer,Take me home.
Homer,I'll scream.
Homer,I don't wanna talk about it!
Homer,"Stupid Barney, thinks he's too good for me."
Homer,But you've got me. Who have I got?
Homer,"Lenny and Carl suck. Please don't tell Lenny and Carl I said that, 'cause if I ever lost them as friends..."
Homer,"Oh, why can't I have a nickname?"
Homer,"Hey, Apu. You got any of those potato chips that give you diarrhea? I need to do a little ""spring cleaning."""
Homer,Barney.
Homer,That's right.
Homer,That I will.
Homer,You keep thinkin' that.
Homer,Me too.
Homer,"Good day, then is right."
Homer,Ta-ta.
Homer,"Lenny, Carl, I know a lot of people bad-mouth you, and focus on how you suck, but not me. To me, you're true blue."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Well, if it isn't Little Miss ""I'm not wasting my life anymore."" Which he is."
Homer,"Oh, no! That's Bart and Lisa!"
Homer,"Barney, you gotta fly us up there and save my kids!"
Homer,Barney...
Homer,The call is from heroism. Will you accept the charges?
Homer,Where are you going? The fire's that way!
Homer,Look out!
Homer,"Barney, no! Don't!"
Homer,No! You've gotta be sober for this. Gimme that!
Homer,"Ugh, it's warm."
Homer,"Oh, yes I can!"
Homer,Gimme that!
Homer,"I won't let you give up now, when you've worked so hard to be the greatest pal in the world. I love you. Let's not lose touch after graduation."
Homer,Stay away from my wife!
Homer,"Hi, kids!"
Homer,Get off! Get off!
Homer,"All right, I'm comin'."
Homer,You can't prove I did it.
Homer,I could do a lotta things if I had some money.
Homer,Yeah. So what do you call this stuff?
Homer,It's not bad.
Homer,...And three makes three.
Homer,It'll be real soon enough.
Homer,"Ooh, my first issue of ""Self-Test Monthly."" Finally I get to find out what makes me tick."
Homer,"Yeah, but in what ratio?"
Homer,Are you a good driver?
Homer,"""Yes."" ""Are you a good lover?"" ""Yes."" Oh, I'm doin' great!"
Homer,My way is easier.
Homer,"Quizmaster, yes... That would entertain me briefly."
Homer,"Okay, Flanders, your love quiz score is 61. That makes you a ""Frigid Frieda."" I took off thirty points for all that crying you did."
Homer,No way. When?
Homer,"Oh, yeah. I saw a gopher. What a day!"
Homer,"Okay. ""Last question: Who is your favorite Backstreet Boy?"""
Homer,According to this you're both idiots.
Homer,"Okay. ""There's a black widow at your door, a rattlesnake at the window, and a scorpion on the phone. Do you A) None of the below, B)..."""
Homer,"Fine. I'll take the next quiz. ""How Long Will You Live?"""
Homer,"""In an average week, how many braised ribs do you eat?"" Marge, do you think that counts honey-braised?"
Homer,"Okay, non-smoker... add eight years. So according to this I'll live to be... 42! Oh, that's horrible! I won't even live to see my children die!"
Homer,I've only got three more years to live!
Homer,"See?! And these quizzes are never wrong, Marge. They're put together by the finest scientists in the magazine business."
Homer,No!
Homer,Can't sleep. Gonna die. Can't sleep. Gonna die.
Homer,"I'm not crazy. It's the TV that's crazy. Aren't you, TV?"
Homer,You see? Gibberish. All gibberish.
Homer,You gotta hide me. Death is after me! And I don't entirely trust these cowboys.
Homer,A mother can't die. And I'm a mother. See?
Homer,Sometimes. But the guy I really hate is your father.
Homer,Why isn't my baby gaining weight?
Homer,I see...
Homer,Florida? But that's America's wang.
Homer,My pockets hurt.
Homer,Par-ty!
Homer,"Well, enjoy your sightseeing. I promise I won't leave this bed."
Homer,"Uh, could you just uh... shut off the..."
Homer,Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!
Homer,Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!
Homer,"Now, this is living!"
Homer,Wooo! I like mu-sic!
Homer,"Oh, no, it's a lost child! Don't worry, folks. I'll tackle him."
Homer,BAWITDABA / BANANA FANA / OOGA CHOCKA / ETC.
Homer,Bring on the rappin' granny!
Homer,What? She's hilarious.
Homer,All for Homer... All for Homer...
Homer,Biatch? Moi?
Homer,WE BUILT THIS CITY / ON ROCK ANNND ROLL! Uh-oh.
Homer,"They called you a pig, Sheriff."
Homer,"Guess how many boobs I saw today, Marge? Fifteen!"
Homer,Doesn't he talk funny?
Homer,"My insomnia, it's gone! Check it out, Marge. I'm sane again! And I owe it all to... Spring Break!"
Homer,Whoo! I'm an animal!
Homer,"Hey, where is everybody?"
Homer,Fine. Be nerds. I'll find some people who know the true meaning of the words par-tay.
Homer,WE BUILT THIS CITY / THIS KICK-ASS CITY / WHAT KIND OF MUSIC BUILT THIS CITY?
Homer,LOOK OUT FOR WHAT?
Homer,THE GI-ANT...
Homer,You'll have to catch me first.
Homer,"Okay, I'll go quietly."
Homer,Look. This is our chance.
Homer,Let's go!
Homer,"Well, I'm gonna try anyway."
Homer,It worked! It's a miracle!
Homer,There's no good place!
Homer,No shade!
Homer,Perfect.
Homer,Or die trying...
Homer,"The only thing we can do. Sit tight, and try to get some sleep."
Homer,"Rise and shine, everybody."
Homer,"Yeah, but first I talked to the engineer. He said there's a procedure for dealing with events of this nature."
Homer,"Okay, now am I the only one on fire? Good."
Homer,I love being married.
Homer,That's perfect! We can hide out here 'til the heat's off.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"More hashbrowns, sugar?"
Homer,But I was just...
Homer,...gonna try to...
Homer,...knock you out...
Homer,JIMMY CRACK CORN AND I DON'T CARE / JIMMY CRACK CORN AND I'M NOT THERE / WE BUILT THIS CITY ON ROCK AND ROLLLLL / SOMETHING SOMETHING DAY.
Homer,"You know, killing that gator was the best decision I ever made."
Homer,"Yep, this place is great. And someday, when Lisa and Bart get married, it'll all be theirs."
Homer,"Okay, but I ain't payin' for two weddin's."
Homer,You'd better.
Homer,"Your Honor, I'd like to represent myself. Drunken hicks of the jury..."
Homer,Uhh... no.
Homer,"Champagne, madame?"
Homer,Son of a--! And the gentleman? Damn it!
Homer,"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
Homer,That's what we've been trying to tell you.
Homer,Fine. There are plenty of other states that are happy to have us.
Homer,Arizona smells funny.
Homer,Poor Cyborganizer
Homer,Talking while the TV's on can't be good for you.
Homer,Nah. I want to enjoy this show before the network retools it.
Homer,Too late.
Homer,"Whee! Touch the sky, Maggie! Whee! Touch the sky!"
Homer,Who said that?
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,I... 8... P.P.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Worse.
Homer,Much better.
Homer,"Oo, my favorite Door."
Homer,Ew. She ruined the Plastic Ono Band.
Homer,Would it get me out of having to choose glasses?
Homer,"Less yappin', more zappin'."
Homer,"Oh, here we go with the add ons. No thanks."
Homer,"Yes, dear."
Homer,"Hey, we got a postcard from Bart. ""Dear Mom and Homer. I'm having fun."" Aw, sounds like he's having fun."
Homer,Didn't you ever go to camp? The ol' Vitamin Barn...
Homer,"Look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes."
Homer,You're Daddy's precious dancing queen!
Homer,"Now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness?"
Homer,Oh! What's that awful sound?
Homer,Shh! This plot is hard enough to follow as it is.
Homer,"Yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off!"
Homer,"Go, Lisa! C'mon, everybody, give it up for my little girl!"
Homer,"I didn't think, I just acted."
Homer,"What are you talking about, Professor Frink? They're clearly in the ""On"" position. See? ""On."""
Homer,"Oh. Ohhhhh. Well, now that I look even closer..."
Homer,"That's not true, honey. You can always write a depressing Broadway play of some kind."
Homer,"Hey, yeah. You could load it up with lots of swears. That's what David Mamet does."
Homer,"Why? It's just a cute little weasel. Hello there, Mister weasel."
Homer,I'm down.
Homer,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Homer,I didn't hit your precious table.
Homer,"Oh, that's just superstition."
Homer,"In about fifteen minutes I'd take off that wedding dress, or you're gonna look crazy."
Homer,"Yes, better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man."
Homer,Remember that talk we had about you not wrecking people's weddings?
Homer,It's settled. The stranger stays with us!
Homer,CH-CH-CH-CHANGES / TIME TO CHANGE THE OIL / YEAH / CHANGES / DON'T WANNA BE AN OILY MAN /
Homer,What are these things in the mashed potatoes?
Homer,"No! Oh, Becky, your potatoes are the best I've ever had."
Homer,"Oh, God."
Homer,Take your time!
Homer,"Becky, I think I speak for all of us when I say ""When's the ice cream gonna get here?"""
Homer,"Run, Marge, run! Pump those crazy legs!"
Homer,"Don't worry, she'll show up here sooner or later. To finish off Becky. Then we'll have Mommy back."
Homer,"I heard she mates with men, then eats them."
Homer,"Oh, about that. Uh -- when I changed your oil, I may have drained your brake fluid. I didn't say anything 'cause I thought you'd be mad."
Homer,You monsters! You've killed her!
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,Everybody wanted a piece of us.
Homer,"Then we figured out we could park them in front of the TV. That's how I was raised, and I turned out TV."
Homer,"Our favorite show was ""Hollywood Hogwash."" But we also loved ""The Dreck Squad""..."
Homer,But we never saw people like us on TV.
Homer,"""My Funny Family,"" take one."
Homer,Aannnd action!
Homer,"Honey, I'm home! The boss is coming to dinner and I need a clean shirt."
Homer,Mamma mia! Now I'll have to do it.
Homer,Not now. I'm busy turning on this washing machine.
Homer,Mamma mia!
Homer,"Every day I thought about firing Marge. You know, just to shake things up."
Homer,...M-E-R. Okay.
Homer,You're almost there.
Homer,Good.
Homer,"Son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes."
Homer,Why you little...!
Homer,And that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags.
Homer,I want to set the record straight. I thought the cop was a prostitute.
Homer,"Hello, Mister Lobster."
Homer,Everything was goin' great at first. I felt like I was king of the world.
Homer,I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!
Homer,"Right about here, I realize something's wrong."
Homer,"Yep, there I go. Then came the rocks. Jagged rocks. Hitting me with their jags."
Homer,"Oh, my leg! This is the worst pain ever! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful! Owww!"
Homer,Why did I take such punishment? Let's just say that fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug was the drugs.
Homer,"Hey, they can't take our house. My pot-bellied pig is in there."
Homer,"Ohhhh, Mister. Porky."
Homer,Who told you about those laws? Was it Marge?
Homer,"Helloooo, Iowa! Does anyone have a donut?"
Homer,"No, something that rocks. That's the sound of today."
Homer,Rocks!
Homer,I'll kill you!
Homer,"Hey, hey, stop it!"
Homer,Who are you! I'll get you!
Homer,"That slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing. It gave us a chance to pursue solo projects. I returned to my first love, the legitimate theater."
Homer,"WHERE IS THE RENT? / I MUST HAVE THE RENT! / DOLLARS, DIMES AND NICKELS / I NEED THEM ALL RIGHT NOW!"
Homer,I literally chewed the scenery.
Homer,That's ridiculous! How could I even get all five necessary drops into her cereal?
Homer,What?
Homer,"So, uh, how's everybody doing?"
Homer,"It was the best Thanksgiving ever. I mean, emotionally, it was terrible. But the turkey was so moist."
Homer,Hi!
Homer,What?! What's she doing here?
Homer,"Yes, go on."
Homer,"We put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to what matters: the show, and the Sunday comic strip."
Homer,Why you little...!
Homer,The Simpsons are going to Delaware!
Homer,This'll be the last season.
Homer,"Hey, who cut out Beetle Bailey? I need my Miss Buxley fix."
Homer,"Eh, too much baggage. Oo, my horoscope. Taurus: ""Today you will die."""
Homer,... and you may get a compliment from an attractive co-worker! Lenny?
Homer,"Ooo, scary newspaper. Don't hurt me, horoscope. I'm afraid of..."
Homer,"Ow! Oooh! Paper cut, paper cut!"
Homer,Missed me! Stupid horoscope!
Homer,Stupid horoscope!
Homer,Cloopid blore-apope!
Homer,"Nah, he'll get tired of biting in an hour or so. Snakes: nature's quitters."
Homer,"That horoscope was baloney. Nothing happened except for the pick ax in my head, the rattlesnake bite and the testicle thing. What's for dessert?"
Homer,Fine.
Homer,"St. Peter! Woo hoo! Got to heaven before you, Flanders!"
Homer,"Well, the thing about that is..."
Homer,"I'm sorry, I didn't get the number of hours or good deeds."
Homer,"Let's see, good deed..."
Homer,... Gotta find a good deed.
Homer,Bingo!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Did you see that? I did the deed! Open up!
Homer,"Hey, I thought you guys could see everything."
Homer,Well I'll be damned.
Homer,I am Hooomer Siiimpsonnn...
Homer,Oh no!
Homer,"Hello, Wife! Hello, children!"
Homer,Who's up for a merry jig?
Homer,"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not merry."
Homer,I lost my job as an oaf today.
Homer,Really?
Homer,Whaddaya think? Do you love it?
Homer,"Oh, I'm no dunce. I was born an oaf, and I'll die an oaf."
Homer,Don't worry. No child will ever starve in my home.
Homer,"So long, kids. Enjoy your new home! Say hi to your other brother and sister."
Homer,"Boy, dumping your kids in the forest sure gets your hands dusty."
Homer,Here's a better idea -- I know how we can replace those children.
Homer,Son? Daughter? I'm ever so sorry.
Homer,"Mmm, sugar walls."
Homer,"Oh, rescue you, stuff myself with candy... It's all good."
Homer,"Oh, that's all you got? Huh? Huh?"
Homer,"Mmmm, fish. Oh no, that's me!"
Homer,Almost. Just give her another twenty minutes.
Homer,Comin' up!
Homer,"... Two Krusty shakes, a donut burger with cheese and a party-size bucket of flan."
Homer,"Yes, I will have fries with that."
Homer,Anything to get out of work.
Homer,Intelligent Italians? Something's wrong.
Homer,Hmm. Phone's off the hook. Everything must be okay.
Homer,"It was her, all right. Take the one who wronged you."
Homer,"Wait, stop! We can outsmart those dolphins! Don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. I'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!"
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Hey, leave my daughter alone! C'mon, humans! We've wiped out entire species before. We can do it again!"
Homer,C'mon lads! Let's drive them back to the ocean!
Homer,"Hey, you gotta hand it to those dolphins. They just wanted it more."
Homer,Television broken?
Homer,"Badger, my ass. It's probably Milhouse."
Homer,Milhouse? Milhouse?
Homer,"It's a badger all right... Or possibly a griffin. Bart, do you have any dynamite in your room?"
Homer,Get it.
Homer,Great idea. Then we should call the doctor about this.
Homer,"What am I, a tailor?"
Homer,Area code? But it's a local call.
Homer,"939?! What the hell is that? Oh, my life is ruined."
Homer,"Oh, if only it were that easy, Marge."
Homer,Go away. We've got bigger problems now.
Homer,"I'm not gonna stand for this. I'm gonna call the newspapers, the TV stations, the gas stations, everybody."
Homer,I hate this new area code. Like I don't have enough to remember already.
Homer,"Don't you miss the old 636, Carl?"
Homer,What really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of warning.
Homer,Not a single word of warning.
Homer,Joan Collins? That girl sleeps with everybody!
Homer,The Who? I love bands!
Homer,That's my number!
Homer,"Hey, that's not me!"
Homer,"It's not fair! I've been a fan of the Who since the very beginning, when they were the Hillbilly Bugger Boys."
Homer,Good idea.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,How the hell did they find that out?
Homer,"Uh, I have a question, Phoney."
Homer,"Quiet, honey. Daddy's asking the man a question."
Homer,Wait a minute! We haven't heard from me yet. The nut with the dynamite. The phone company is bamboozling you!
Homer,I accuse the phone company of making that film on purpose!
Homer,"Now, I'm not one to make trouble... but it seems to me that everyone who got to keep the old, or ""classic"" 636 area code, lives on... the rich side of town!"
Homer,"And as usual, we Joe Twelve-Packs get the royal screw job."
Homer,"Well, I've had it! You rich snobs aren't pushin' us around anymore!"
Homer,"Well, I..."
Homer,"Nice wiring, Bart."
Homer,"Okay, Plan B. Fellow 9-3-9'ers, I say we break off and form our own city!"
Homer,Now who's stupid?
Homer,There. We're officially a city. Now we just sit back and wait for an NFL franchise.
Homer,Keep walkin'
Homer,"Mayor, eh?"
Homer,"I reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job."
Homer,New Springfield rocks!
Homer,Oh yeah? What is it?
Homer,Damnit!
Homer,Read my lips: Yes.
Homer,No problem.
Homer,Stop right there.
Homer,"Sweetie, you know your mother and I only stay together for the sake of my political career."
Homer,Big grins!
Homer,That'll play great in the sticks.
Homer,"Oh, that was fifty already?"
Homer,"Hey, the TV man is talking about us!"
Homer,"Oh yeah? They think they're better than us, huh? Bart, c'mere a minute."
Homer,Oh yeah?
Homer,"Thank you, Marge. Now, let's see how Olde Snobfield does without electricity."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Those rich, snobby Indians."
Homer,Woo hoo! Flood from water!
Homer,You're right. We've got to block them from our sight with a giant wall.
Homer,Good idea. We should call the guys they used.
Homer,It's ringing.
Homer,And I'd like to thank Low Ball Construction for building this amazing wall... From ninety percent recycled materials.
Homer,"Loyal citizens of New Springfield. You stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools, and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all."
Homer,"Don't worry, we have plenty of supplies to get through tomorrow. And then a wave of disease should help to -- hey!"
Homer,Stop streaming over the wall! At least wait till I'm through talking.
Homer,"Okay, now as for food, the following breeds of dog are edible..."
Homer,I can't believe all those rats fled my town.
Homer,Guess it's just us and the tumbleweeds.
Homer,I can't believe those traitors abandoned us. They couldn't take one lousy famine.
Homer,No problem.
Homer,"Anyhow, those rats'll come crawling back..."
Homer,We've got the Who playing here tonight.
Homer,"Hey, maybe we could. But we'll need some liquid persuasion."
Homer,"C'mon, Bart. We're gonna bring back The Who."
Homer,Uh...
Homer,"Huh? Oh, right."
Homer,I'll give you this bottle of chloroform if you'll take us to The Who.
Homer,"Wow, The Who!"
Homer,Woo! Rock 'n' roll!
Homer,"Whatever. The point is, I'm Homer Simpson."
Homer,That's right.
Homer,"That's right. And I implore you to move your concert to our town. Don't play Olde Springfield, or as it is sometimes known, Sun City."
Homer,"C'mon, what happened to the angry, defiant Who of ""My Generation,"" ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" and ""Mama's Got a Squeeze Box""?"
Homer,"But those Olde Springfield squares are just gonna make you cut your hair, turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like Keith Partridge."
Homer,Somethin' wrong with your legs?
Homer,"Oh, don't worry. They'll be here soon. And then they'll see who's got the better town."
Homer,Now these are the tunes I want you boys to play.
Homer,"Oh, c'mon, it plays itself. ""Pacman Fever / A do do do do / It's driving me crazy."" Look Lisa, Daddy's in the Who!"
Homer,"So, New Springfield's lookin' pretty good now, isn't it? With our ample parking and daily Who concerts."
Homer,We'll talk.
Homer,Ha-ha. You hit the tire fire! You'll have to do...
Homer,Why me?
Homer,Magic Bus!
Homer,Pinball Wizard!
Homer,"Well Marge, looks like your insane experiment is over."
Homer,This watermelon won't know what hit it.
Homer,"Yeah, we're heroes... But where's our parade?"
Homer,"All right. ""Open stuck drawer..."" All-righty."
Homer,"Eh, it's hopeless."
Homer,"Yeah, it's hopeless."
Homer,"I said, it's... Ohhh..."
Homer,"Listen, do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast?"
Homer,"Oh, don't worry. You'll be sleeping in this beautiful new doghouse. Target date: January, 2007."
Homer,"And now, the grand finale... ""Get Lisa's jammed tape out of VCR."""
Homer,"Oop, wait a minute..."
Homer,There.
Homer,Fire in the hole!
Homer,Hmm. It's gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean this place up.
Homer,"Uh, honey, there's a point in every father's life when he blows up his daughter's room."
Homer,"Oh Lisa, this must be a rough time for you. Do you have any friends or family you can stay with?"
Homer,"Oh, come on. Tell us how we can make it up to you. Hey, pretend it's your birthday."
Homer,Anything at all. You name it. What do you want to do?
Homer,Stupid Lisa.
Homer,okay.
Homer,Idiots.
Homer,"Dear Lord, bless this humble meal, and did you hear about Krusty? Whoa, man! I mean, I knew he was a player, but geez, a kid?"
Homer,"Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters. So, how's Maude Flanders doin' up there? She playin' the field? Ooh... yeah, really? All those guys? Amen."
Homer,"Okay, that stings Daddy's eyes, honey."
Homer,"Well, I won't lie. Fatherhood isn't easy like motherhood. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. Except for some mag wheels. Oh, man, that would be sweet."
Homer,"Just a second, honey. Daddy's on his high horse."
Homer,"Yeah, I'm watching, honey. Nice cannonball. Anyhoo, the key to fathering is don't over-think. 'Cause over-thinking is... What were we talking about? Ooh, a clown."
Homer,My uncle still has my nose.
Homer,Can we make this hand high-low?
Homer,I fold.
Homer,"A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A-WEEM..."
Homer,"Maybe so, but Dawson's gonna be bummed."
Homer,"Marge, may I play devil's advocate for a moment?"
Homer,C'mon! Get in there!
Homer,"Stupid game! Now, what were we talking about?"
Homer,"Oh, right. Why don't we just break into Fat Tony's compound and get it back?"
Homer,For a casual acquaintance like you? Absolutely.
Homer,"This is perfect! If I know Fat Tony, which I don't, he'll be distracted by his hosting duties. Come on."
Homer,That violin's gotta be around here somewhere.
Homer,I have a plan.
Homer,"Well, that didn't work."
Homer,I think we're in the clear.
Homer,I said I was sorry.
Homer,"Sorry you're such jerks! Ha, ha!"
Homer,Ow! That Bullet went in.
Homer,"You want money? Get a job, like your old man."
Homer,"So, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?"
Homer,I like your attitude. Take what you need.
Homer,"No, of course not."
Homer,"Take that, Lisa's beliefs."
Homer,I knew this day would come. The cows are taking back what's theirs.
Homer,"Look, Marge! I'm in a limo! The Simpsons are going to Paris!"
Homer,Bor-ing!
Homer,"Ah, the Luftwaffe. The Washington Generals of the History Channel."
Homer,"First comes love, then comes, um... Dammit, I know this."
Homer,Have a good time at your hippie club.
Homer,"No, I like to save the environment in my own way."
Homer,Mmm... donuts.
Homer,"Sheesh, look at these refugees. How 'bout a smile?"
Homer,"Well, moping won't make it better."
Homer,"Marge, she's gonna narc on our stash."
Homer,"This is your fault, with your non-threatening Bobby Sherman-style good looks. No girl could resist your charms."
Homer,"I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. I was lost in your eyes."
Homer,You call that saying grace?!
Homer,"Oh no, Lisa's gone! And nothing will bring her back. Unless..."
Homer,"Oh, praise God, you're alive! Unless..."
Homer,"Oh, must hide Lisa...!"
Homer,Come i-in!
Homer,"Grieving father, comin' through..."
Homer,"Thanks for the beer, Moe. But before Lisa died, she made this tape that I think you should hear."
Homer,Read it!
Homer,"Oh, here we go."
Homer,Nooo! It was finger Ling-Ling good!
Homer,"Well, what do you want, a medal?"
Homer,Love you.
Homer,"No, really."
Homer,"Oh, how embarrassing. Well, let me just give you one of my many other valid..."
Homer,Run!
Homer,"Okay, so we can't pay for your precious food. What are you gonna do about it?"
Homer,Can we go now?
Homer,Fine. You want passion? I'll give you passion.
Homer,BLUE SPANISH EYES / TEARDROPS ARE FALLING FROM YOUR SPANISH EYES...
Homer,I think it was when that cold snap killed off all the hoboes.
Homer,I had to sell it for gas money.
Homer,Which I spent on a novelty horn.
Homer,"Financial panther, eh?"
Homer,"Get him, Sheeba!"
Homer,I'm on board.
Homer,"Just give the word, and I'll cut him off."
Homer,Consider it done.
Homer,"Marge, your posture looks terrible."
Homer,"Yes, go on..."
Homer,But how do I get it?
Homer,I'm just trying to work up the courage to ask Burns for a raise. Or a highly-paid internship. Something to solve my money woes.
Homer,That's the sneeze guard. You have to lean under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.
Homer,Mr. Burns... I was wondering if I could get a raise.
Homer,Whopping?
Homer,"Well, sir... you see, sir... I've worked here a long time, and my wife has a game leg, and my kids have game things as well..."
Homer,"A laugh? Okay, let's see, what's in the news today?..."
Homer,At Lenny? But he's a war hero!
Homer,No!
Homer,Okay.
Homer,I liked when I threw the pudding.
Homer,You're the boss.
Homer,Will you keep giving me money?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"I'd like to buy a mint condition ""Spider-Man Number One,"" please."
Homer,"Uh, no thanks. I'll just eat it here."
Homer,Do I get paid now?
Homer,Little help?
Homer,"Little help, please? I made a boom-boom..."
Homer,Baby made a boom-boom.
Homer,"Here you are, my good man. And while you're at it, throw in one of those polio shots."
Homer,Anti-polio.
Homer,I've been doing some outside projects for Mr. Burns.
Homer,"Oh, y'know, business stuff... downsizing, e-solutions, the glass ceiling..."
Homer,"Well, why do I have to do the Lindy Hop?"
Homer,Can't take the pain...
Homer,Huh? Help! Mr. Burns!
Homer,Am I glad to see you guys. You gotta call...
Homer,Did you see Daddy dance? They all saw me dance.
Homer,Yes. I humiliate myself for fistfuls of cash.
Homer,I know.
Homer,Maybe for you. How come you didn't rescue me?
Homer,"Well, you could treat me with a little respect."
Homer,"You see, that's what I'm saying."
Homer,"Shh-shh, the grownups are talking, honey."
Homer,"She's right. Yes, I may be naked and reeking of panda love, but I've got to stop this before it goes too far."
Homer,I retract my statement.
Homer,"I mean, screw you!"
Homer,"Huh? Oh, why did he have to say that extra thing?"
Homer,"Aw, thank you, sweetheart, but what should I do with this dirty, ill-gotten money? I better throw it in the garbage."
Homer,I see what you're saying -- I need to buy a gun.
Homer,You're right. It's time to rebuild my self-esteem.
Homer,"Hey, what happened to...?"
Homer,"Excuse me, sir."
Homer,"I'd like to buy all these toys for some needy children. Is this enough dirty, dirty money?"
Homer,I'm just tryin' to dig myself out of a pit of shame.
Homer,It's okay.
Homer,"I don't need to rehearse. Ho, ho, ho, Merry... Line!"
Homer,What? Lemme see that.
Homer,"Ho, ho, ho, Merry Everyone!"
Homer,What are you doing here? I told you I'm not your monkey anymore.
Homer,"The answer is no, Mr. Burns. Not for any amount of money."
Homer,"Oh, so much money..."
Homer,But Santa can't be evil...
Homer,But it's so much money.
Homer,"Not yet, honey."
Homer,Let's just say Lisa gave me an early Christmas present. The gift of dignity.
Homer,Baby made a boom-boom.
Homer,"Hey, open up! I've been standing here all morning."
Homer,No one told me the plant was closed!
Homer,What's an e-mail?
Homer,I don't have a computer.
Homer,That does it. I'm getting a computer! As soon as somebody lets me outta here!
Homer,Oh. I'm so stupid.
Homer,Uh... I guess I'll take that one.
Homer,"Well, a paperweight would be nice, but what I really need is a computer. How about that one?"
Homer,"Heavens, no!"
Homer,I just need something to receive e-mail.
Homer,I was an astronaut.
Homer,Five thousand dollars!
Homer,"This is the best computer in the world and always will be, right?"
Homer,"Hey Lisa, check out my new computer!"
Homer,That's right! Top of the line!
Homer,"Stupid pothole. Don't worry, head. The computer will do our thinking now."
Homer,"Oh, yeah... perfect. Now then..."
Homer,Computer... kill Flanders.
Homer,Good start! Now finish the job!
Homer,$5000 for a computer and it can't handle a simple assignment.
Homer,You're it!
Homer,Hmmmmm.
Homer,Fine!
Homer,"Ooh, a dancing Jesus. De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de. If there's a better use for the Internet, I haven't found it."
Homer,Hey!
Homer,"Here it is, everybody! The world's greatest website!"
Homer,"You'd think all the noises would be annoying, but they're not."
Homer,"No kiddin'. What do you think of my page, Lisa? Be honest. It's great, isn't it? Go ahead and say it's great if you want to."
Homer,They can't sue me if they don't know who I am. I'll just call myself Mr. X.
Homer,"Yep, you can't go wrong with Mr. X."
Homer,I can't. My web page hasn't gotten a single hit.
Homer,Come on.
Homer,That lousy pothole! Why don't they fix it?
Homer,Get out! Who told you that?
Homer,"Hmm, that's the kind of dirt that belongs on my web page."
Homer,"Nelson has never steered me wrong, honey. Nelson is gold."
Homer,Beautiful. We have confirmation.
Homer,I did it. I changed the world. Now I know exactly how God feels.
Homer,Bring me two of every animal.
Homer,Darn tootin'.
Homer,No way! Mr. X is gonna keep on digging... and probing... until every person in this town is in jail!
Homer,What a bombshell!
Homer,"Oh, I don't know, Carl. He might be closer than you think."
Homer,No!
Homer,I am not. Or am I?
Homer,No!
Homer,"Hey, Moe, can you keep a secret?"
Homer,Not even a little one?
Homer,What if I just whisper it?
Homer,I'VE BEEN SITTIN' ON THE TOILET / ALL THE LIVE-LONG DAY...
Homer,I love spying.
Homer,"And who's selling the uranium to the terrorists? Montgomery Burns. Now, we wait."
Homer,Whoa... He's in trouble.
Homer,Nooo!
Homer,I'm Mr. X! Gimme! Gimme!
Homer,"Thank you, folks. And now I'm off to expose more secret conspiracies and..."
Homer,I bit my tongue!
Homer,Finally.
Homer,They're with God now.
Homer,"Hey, guys. How's it goin'?"
Homer,"Oh, don't worry about the Mr. X thing. I'm just here for a beer."
Homer,I smell another Pulitzer.
Homer,Nobody's visiting my web page anymore. My counter is actually going down.
Homer,That's a great idea! I'll make up some news!
Homer,"Let's see now... ""BULLETIN: New Race Discovered Living Six Inches Under... Denver."""
Homer,All Named 'Morton'... or... 'Mortonson'...
Homer,"Real news is great, son. But I'm gettin' a thousand hits an hour with grade-A bull plop."
Homer,"Gimme a hundred Lotto tickets, Apu. Because Mr. X is on a roll."
Homer,"Stop it, Apu. You're scaring me."
Homer,What's going on?
Homer,"Help, I'm being kidnapped!"
Homer,"Save me, Mr. X! Wait, I'm Mr. X."
Homer,Wuzzah?
Homer,What the hell?
Homer,How did I get here? What is this place?
Homer,How do I get outta here?
Homer,So I'm a prisoner? How come?
Homer,But I don't know anything. At least I don't think I do.
Homer,No you won't!
Homer,"Hello, operator? I'd like to report a really weird island. Please send lots of rescue copters to..."
Homer,"All right, whatever."
Homer,"I am not a number, I am a man. And don't you ever... Oh, wait, I'm Number 5. Ha ha! In your face, Number 6!"
Homer,Who are all these oddballs?
Homer,Wow.
Homer,"So, who brought us here?"
Homer,Did you bring us here?
Homer,"Oh, they drugged the tea. They knew my one weakness."
Homer,Who are you and why are you holding me here? I want answers now or I want them eventually.
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,That's impossible. All my stories are bull plop. Bull plop!
Homer,But why?
Homer,"Of course! It's so simple... Wait, no it's not. It's needlessly complicated."
Homer,"No, sir."
Homer,"Look, you can drug me all you want, but my family won't rest till they find my drug-bloated corpse."
Homer,I'm sorry. What?
Homer,I'm tired of being drugged and gagged. There's gotta be a way to escaped.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Oh, no! An anti-escape orb!"
Homer,"Huh, that was easy."
Homer,What a horrible four months. Now to warn everybody.
Homer,Attention: some crazy creeps on an island somewhere are secretly running the world...
Homer,Hey!
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Not a chance. No one can silence me, but me!"
Homer,Whuh?
Homer,"If I know me, he won't like being kicked in the crotch."
Homer,"Oh, Marge. It's me, the real Homer!"
Homer,Absolutely.
Homer,The dog thinks so...
Homer,Bad dog.
Homer,"Oh, it's wonderful."
Homer,Truly God's country.
Homer,See you on the island.
Homer,"Okay, you can park my car, but no joyriding."
Homer,Wait a minute...
Homer,Beer! Yes! How did you know?
Homer,He's very good.
Homer,So she was made of chimps.
Homer,"Gee, I wish I could, son, but we've already left the gift shop."
Homer,What the hell is that?!
Homer,I know that. How much to fix it?
Homer,I can't afford that.
Homer,He couldn't breathe.
Homer,Step right up! See the magic boy! Witness mystifying feats that will leave you scratching your head until it's raw and bloody!
Homer,"Come on, pony up, Flanders. The kid's not turning tricks for nothin'."
Homer,Black arts?!
Homer,"Okay, we'll move. We don't want any trouble, fellas."
Homer,"I know, but which one?"
Homer,Sixty cents?! I would've made more if I'd gone into work today!
Homer,A good son would come through for his dad!
Homer,I told you! I find them boring.
Homer,"Oh, that's it! You can walk home!"
Homer,"Stupid, non-magical son, can't pay to fix my car."
Homer,What the?!
Homer,Is that a steak?
Homer,Who gave you all this money?
Homer,"Really. Hey, maybe we could do that again. Can you look even more pathetic?"
Homer,"Oh ho, ho, that's beautiful! We could make a fortune."
Homer,"Well, yeah. But God conned me out of sixty-five hundred bucks in car repairs."
Homer,There ya go! We'd be stealing from people we know. It's just like the seasons.
Homer,I think you know the answer to that.
Homer,They have any father-and-son grifts?
Homer,Interesting.
Homer,I could ask you the very same question.
Homer,Would you?
Homer,You bet. Let's trim the mark.
Homer,"Ten-four, Kemosabe."
Homer,"What have you done, you clumsy little ox?! That cake was for your deaf sister!"
Homer,"No, no. Don't protect him. You'll work off that cake in the acid mines."
Homer,"Well, you're the mark."
Homer,... of integrity.
Homer,"A singing rubber fish, of course."
Homer,What in the hell are you talking about?
Homer,"Oh, right, the magic. The magic was great. It's really... the way to go."
Homer,Suckers.
Homer,Dog for sale!
Homer,Dog for sale!
Homer,"Oh, he's not for sale."
Homer,Although if the right offer came along...
Homer,"Here's for the repairs, and a little extra for you."
Homer,"Yes, son?"
Homer,In a way. But I also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. Plus the baldness.
Homer,"Hello, is the lady of the house in?"
Homer,"Oh, of course, of course. It's just that..."
Homer,"Well, before she died, she ordered this Bible especially for you."
Homer,"Now, you weren't home, so we had to pay the delivery man..."
Homer,We'll be safe here.
Homer,Dad?
Homer,How'd you get wise to us?
Homer,"So what's the pitch, old man?"
Homer,Oh... my... God.
Homer,Let's dust a few fossils.
Homer,Which one of you youngsters is Abe Simpson?
Homer,You've just won 10 million dollars from that Publisher's Cleary-dealie!
Homer,He's dead.
Homer,I guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters. Too bad we couldn't just give it to these nice folks.
Homer,You're right. We'd better just take this check back for shredding.
Homer,"Thank you... no shoving... that's right, put your money in here... all of it... Is that everyone?"
Homer,"What's your problem, Sport? Afraid to be rich?"
Homer,So we're under arrest for fraud?
Homer,"Thanks, woo, it took a lotta grifting."
Homer,"Yeah. We're not criminals. We're just two crazy, mixed-up kids."
Homer,You'd do that for us?
Homer,"Okay, thank you, sir."
Homer,"Don't worry, son. I have an idea."
Homer,"Chief, I'd like to scare my son straight. Could I show him a jail cell?"
Homer,Yeah. Ya big idiot...
Homer,Colgate Cavity Patrol?
Homer,"Yeah, he conned us good. Well, at least we still have our jobs at the sweepstakes place."
Homer,What?
Homer,"Lies got us into this mess, son. From now on it's honesty all the way."
Homer,"Absolutely. We had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... Bart, would you call him a crazy man?"
Homer,"Well, hmm, let's see, he was foreign and he had some..."
Homer,"Uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly."
Homer,"Anyhoo, the whole nightmare has really made us sleepy. Let's hit the hay."
Homer,Huh? But that's impossible.
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Well, look at that. But who called the police?"
Homer,"'Course he did, son. He's a filthy crook. Now, let's all hit the hay."
Homer,I guess you haven't heard of chloroform.
Homer,Let's see how this plays out.
Homer,"I told you, my memory is fuzzy. Fuzzy!"
Homer,"Yes, exactly! No, no! I mean, the whole incident is hazy."
Homer,"Yes, exactly!"
Homer,Hey? Mountain Dew?!
Homer,When the time is right...
Homer,Let's see where he's going with this...
Homer,Stop! This has gone on just long enough.
Homer,Nobody carjacked me. I tried to pull a con and got conned myself. And then I lied to you all! So did Bart.
Homer,But Skinner got shot!
Homer,But what about the guy who took my car?
Homer,I can't believe everyone was in on it.
Homer,"Wait a minute. You're telling me the police force, the TV news, a courthouse full of people, and a popular entertainer had nothing better to do than to teach me and Bart a lesson?"
Homer,"Heh, heh, heh. Tremendous."
Homer,"Lenny, are you watching this?"
Homer,I know!
Homer,Circus?
Homer,But I wanna watch Bret Favre!
Homer,I missed one of Jerry's zingers. Now I'll never catch up.
Homer,"Oh, yeah, that's way better than fun and excitement."
Homer,I wanted to see 'em fire a gorilla out of a cannon.
Homer,Just smash it open!
Homer,Oh no you don't! I paid full price for this freak show. Now nourish the child within me! Nourish...
Homer,"One snow angel, comin' up."
Homer,"Ahh, why does that always happen?"
Homer,Man -- everyone has a snow day but us.
Homer,I 'unno... Internet?
Homer,"My car, your roof. It's only fair."
Homer,"Well, yeah."
Homer,"I think I know my own life, Ned."
Homer,CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS / MR. PLOW.
Homer,"I hope it's Flanders. I'm just kidding. Hey, you're all right."
Homer,... I FEEL LIKE MAKIN' LOVE / MAKIN' LOVE TO YOU! / DO DO DOOO / DO DO DOOO.
Homer,"Yeah, as a tribute to Princess Di. And Dodi. Because these days, princesses..."
Homer,"Wait, let's just leave it on till we forget our troubles."
Homer,Marvelous! Marvelous! Enough! I grow weary of your sexually suggestive dancing.
Homer,Bring me my ranch-dressing hose.
Homer,"I know, ranch dressing."
Homer,A hamster ball!
Homer,We're free! And we've got something to eat.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,You're the camel.
Homer,"Hey, this car's got cruise control."
Homer,"School, please."
Homer,Do you have airbags?
Homer,"C'mon, kids. Let's leave this awful place and never come back."
Homer,Whuh?
Homer,"Oh, baby!"
Homer,No use struggling my beloved Chalamela.
Homer,Animation is so great. It's way better than... whatever the alternative is.
Homer,"Wait a minute, was that cat making out with that mouse? 'Cause if they were..."
Homer,Pick me! Pick me!
Homer,I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT / SHORT AND STOUT / HERE IS MY HANDLE / HERE IS MY SPOUT.
Homer,That motion-capture suit is just what this country needs. Just think of all the hilarious motions that are going uncaptured. Like this...
Homer,"See? Now wouldn't you love to see that move, performed by a cartoon possum?"
Homer,You're right. That suit gizmo could be worth billions. And I'm gonna get a piece of the action!
Homer,"I'd like to withdraw my life savings, please. And hurry!"
Homer,"Oh. Yes, of course. Uh, she's behind that plant."
Homer,"Hello, Marge. Hi, Homie. Sign this, please? You're the boss! Daddy, ask the man for some candy! No, no, no candy for you. Then at least get some candy for yourself."
Homer,Kids.
Homer,"So long, sucker!"
Homer,"Uh Yes, I see that it's in bill form. Excellent."
Homer,"I'd like to buy 500 shares of ""ANIMOTION, INCORPORATED."""
Homer,Absolutely.
Homer,You heard the monkey -- make the trade.
Homer,Animotion.
Homer,Yahoo!
Homer,Huh? What is this crap?
Homer,"Sleep tight, my beloved. You're my ticket out of this hellhole."
Homer,Sorry. Our ticket out of this hellhole.
Homer,Yes!
Homer,"Oh, I hope ""plunging"" means ""up,"" and ""seventy-five"" means ""two hundred."""
Homer,Family meeting! Family meeting!
Homer,"Okay people, let's keep this short. We all want to get home to our families."
Homer,"All right, first item: I lost our life savings in the stock market. Now, let's move on to the real issue: Lisa's hogging of the maple syrup."
Homer,Point of order: I didn't lose all the money. There was enough left for this cowbell.
Homer,"Damn you, e-Bay!"
Homer,"I have a great way to solve our money woes: you rent your womb to a rich, childless couple. If you agree, signify by getting indignant."
Homer,"C'mon, Marge. We're a team! It's uter-us, not uter-you."
Homer,"You mean, like, medical testing?"
Homer,"Yeah, but aren't those experiments dangerous?"
Homer,Hmmmm.
Homer,It burns! It burns!
Homer,Food? I'm BLIND!
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,There's a crayon in my brain?!
Homer,But I've had thousands of head x-rays. How come no one ever noticed it before?
Homer,"Well, I'm not sure, but it mighta happened when I was six."
Homer,"Hey, I came here to be drugged, electrocuted and probed, not insulted."
Homer,"Hmmm. Increase my killing power, eh? Let's do it."
Homer,I just underwent a procedure to increase my IQ fifty points.
Homer,"And they gave me this spiffy nerd ensemble, too."
Homer,Is the capital of North Dakota Bismarck?
Homer,"Dr. Joyce Brothers may be well known, but her psychological credentials are highly suspect."
Homer,"Now, who's up for a trip to the library tomorrow? Notice I no longer say ""liberry"" or ""tomorry""."
Homer,It's a date!
Homer,"Everything from Hop on Pop to Death Be Not Proud. It's so tragic, the way they hopped on pop."
Homer,Get out!
Homer,"Hey, Flanders, headin' for church? Well, I thought I could save you a little time."
Homer,"Better. I was working on a flat tax proposal, and I accidentally proved there's no God."
Homer,I am here to give hope to the least of you. Because we all have a crayon up our nose. Maybe it's not a crayon made of wax. Maybe it's a crayon made of prejudice...
Homer,"Yes, Nelson?"
Homer,"Not being a moron, I wouldn't know. However, ."
Homer,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you your moron!"
Homer,You see? It's cool to be smart.
Homer,"So be like me, and use your minds: paint a painting, sing a song, and dance a dance!"
Homer,I've compiled a thorough safety report on this plant.
Homer,"I've decided to disintermediate the local authorities, and send it straight to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."
Homer,"Comfy, isn't it?"
Homer,"Wait, you can't hate me. I'm your better! Your better!"
Homer,"Effigy, eh? Yeah, nothing burns like an effigy. Hey, that's me!"
Homer,Stop that! The fire inspector would be appalled.
Homer,So you all hate me?
Homer,"Hmm, I'm detecting a distinct strain of anti-intellectualism in this tavern..."
Homer,"Lisa, why didn't you warn me? Being a brain has alienated me from all my friends."
Homer,"Well, what gets you through the day?"
Homer,A walk? That's a really good idea.
Homer,I don't understand. That wasn't funny.
Homer,"Hey, don't blame me. This movie is tired and predictable. You know she's gonna wind up marrying Richard Gere."
Homer,"It's Bill Pullman, you fool!"
Homer,Is there no place for the man with a 105 IQ?
Homer,I'm a Spaulding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Change me back to the blissful boob I was!
Homer,That's ridiculous. You do nothing but play God! And I think your octoparrot would agree.
Homer,"Oh, that would be heaven!"
Homer,Moe Szyslak?!
Homer,I want you to stick this crayon into my brain.
Homer,"Deeper, you pusillanimous pilsner-pusher."
Homer,Dee-fense! Dee-fense!
Homer,Extended warranty? How can I lose?
Homer,Who wants lottery tickets?
Homer,We were what what in a what what?
Homer,"Yeah, which reminds me, I need a sandwich."
Homer,The wrestler?
Homer,I'unno. Must be sumpin' I wrote before Moe fixed me.
Homer,"Huh? Oh, you want a hug. Well that, I know how to do."
Homer,Mmm... hug.
Homer,Whuzzit... My juice box!
Homer,Just give me ten more hours.
Homer,"Did you say ""Smockron""?"
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Man, that was a good Apron Expo."
Homer,"Heh, heh. ""Grill Power."""
Homer,"It was great, all right. But all I wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. Because when all is said and done... Prison rodeo!?"
Homer,Today!
Homer,"Relax, they've got rodeo clowns."
Homer,"That's not gonna do it, Marge. You need something red."
Homer,"Hey, Toro! Here's something to gore!"
Homer,"Not now, honey. Daddy's busy."
Homer,"Now, for a little calming blue."
Homer,"Hey, where's your blue shirt?"
Homer,I can't complain.
Homer,"Oh God, my back! It hurts so much, and my job is so unfulfilling!"
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,And his fondness for the guitar.
Homer,Air?
Homer,There's an Air in Space Museum.
Homer,"Oh God, my back..."
Homer,"Well, there's a dull ache, certainly. And overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. Only instead of bacon, there's agony. Marge, can I have a BLT?"
Homer,What are you looking at?
Homer,"First I'd feel like having a BLT, then proud of you."
Homer,My back!
Homer,So? Just gimme some drugs and surgery.
Homer,"Yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front."
Homer,"Hey, I thought real doctors hated chiropractors."
Homer,"Less yakkin', more crackin'."
Homer,"Hey, it feels a little better."
Homer,"One, two, better-not-sue..."
Homer,"Ow! Owww, my back. Dr. Steve didn't do anything."
Homer,"Yeah, right. I did 'em while you were studying."
Homer,Yeah... In fact...
Homer,I feel fantastic!
Homer,"Not ""trash can,"" son. Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder! Patent pending."
Homer,"And as you can see, the unique dents in my invention perfectly match the contours of the human vertebrains."
Homer,"Patent pending... Patent pending... Patent pending... Hey, who's this guy?"
Homer,"You brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea?"
Homer,"Hmm. I don't know what that is, so I'm gonna say yes. Now, go limp."
Homer,Next!
Homer,"Boy, talk about irony. The AMA tries to drive you guys out of business. Now you're doing the same to me. Think about the irony..."
Homer,Not unless you think about the irony.
Homer,"Okay, that should do it, Moe."
Homer,"Ah, you saw our bus ad."
Homer,We might be able to do business.
Homer,"Hey, where're you going with that?"
Homer,"Wait a minute, no investor could bend like that."
Homer,Nooo! My Spine-O-Cylinder!
Homer,They'll pay for what they did to my can.
Homer,Five? Why don't we make it fifty?
Homer,You're gonna regret this.
Homer,"Wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals..."
Homer,So many flavors! All those tasty memories flooding back!
Homer,"Son, I know it hurts. I still remember my first lifetime banning..."
Homer,"I can still see your movies, right?"
Homer,...And I never saw Gallagher again.
Homer,Tom Savini?
Homer,Don't worry your spiky little head. I've got it all planned out.
Homer,You're right. Gimme a minute. Hmmm.
Homer,For once in my life I'm tall. Don't take that away from me.
Homer,"Hell-o, I'm Shaquille O'Neal. Let us in, please."
Homer,"Sorry, son."
Homer,No problem.
Homer,Woo! Dinner!
Homer,I love the theater.
Homer,"Now, when you've got a bum ticker like we do, you need all the friends you can get. And Moe's is the friendliest place in the Rum District."
Homer,"Aw, now, be nice, Moe. This guy just got out of the hospital."
Homer,"C'mon, you're here to make friends."
Homer,I can't decide. I throw myself on the mercy of the food court.
Homer,And I'll have the beef Wellington.
Homer,"Get that one! Faster! You got half time for the other ones. Oh, good. Oh no, that one's slowing up! Oh, good. Oh, that one's wobbling! Oh, up... you got that before I even said it."
Homer,"Hey, let's get this down to the funeral home before they try to back out."
Homer,"Oh, the whole deal. Coffin. Tombstone. Anti-stink spray."
Homer,What funny names.
Homer,That thing got picture-in-picture?
Homer,"Ah, geez. How come they never call traveling anymore?"
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, this is gettin' kind of pricey."
Homer,Okay!
Homer,What?!
Homer,Mr. Salesman?
Homer,We're gonna go with the wolves.
Homer,"Dad, I love you this much."
Homer,"But that's just under nine hundred dollars. I wish I could go seventeen thousand, but..."
Homer,"Tennis court, eh?..."
Homer,I'll bet you didn't see that comin'.
Homer,"Of course I do, Dad."
Homer,"And if it were up to me, you wouldn't die at all..."
Homer,But try tellin' that to Killy McGee up there.
Homer,What on Earth are you doing?
Homer,That's tennis?! Then what's the one where the chicks whale on each other?
Homer,Yes! That's what I wanted!
Homer,"And finally, make sure the net is tight and springy."
Homer,That seems about right.
Homer,And it's bad news for the gophers.
Homer,"Yeah, it'd be nice to entertain friends and have people over."
Homer,"Keep walkin', Flanders."
Homer,Fas-ter.
Homer,"Sorry, I grunted way too early."
Homer,"Hey, this was a lot of fun, guys."
Homer,And how about that Stephanie the weather girl?
Homer,Wow. How do you come up with such witty remarks?
Homer,Get off my property.
Homer,I've had it with that school!
Homer,Door.
Homer,"Hey, check it out! I'm surfing the net!"
Homer,"Come on, Marge -- all sports have their lovable clowns: John Rocker, O.J. Simpson, Dorf..."
Homer,I've got it! It's in the bag!
Homer,"Do-I-have-cooties? No. Oh, this home testing kit saved me a fortune."
Homer,"Ohhh, well that's bad news for Dingbat Charlie. He's gonna be crushed."
Homer,"Okay, now some of that is me."
Homer,"Okay, honey. I can see this means a lot to you. I'll practice till my elbow is swollen and discolored."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Good news, honey. I found a way to prove to the town we're not losers. I've entered us in a doubles tournament."
Homer,"Don't worry. The tournament's not till tomorrow. Okay, get ready for the serve."
Homer,"How embarrassing. You take over, Bart."
Homer,"Lisa! Lisa, beer me."
Homer,"I'll be right out, honey."
Homer,Now that's the kinda nagging I can live with.
Homer,"So Barney's like ""you're on your own, dude,"" and I'm like ""not even."""
Homer,I'm getting to that.
Homer,"Lookin' good, Honey. I think you and I might just win this tournament dealy."
Homer,"Hey, Bart. Yeah, you got your daddy's hustle."
Homer,"Too busy to reply, huh? I know how that goes. Well, I think I'll go lay out my clothes for the tournament."
Homer,Per-fect.
Homer,"Well, I'm ready for the big tournament."
Homer,"Hey there, son!"
Homer,"With that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament."
Homer,It's gonna be tough without a partner.
Homer,"Well, good for you! Anyone I know?"
Homer,"Good morning, partner!"
Homer,The name of Bart's partner? I'm all ears.
Homer,"Yes, darling?"
Homer,"No. No, no, no. You're my partner."
Homer,Nooo!
Homer,Traitors!
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,I don't think they saw me.
Homer,"Hello, Marge."
Homer,"Hello, Bart. How are the tennis partners?"
Homer,Don't touch me. Your hands feel like salad tongs.
Homer,My manhood? I never thought of that!
Homer,"I don't care about B.C., I care about M.E. My enjoyment."
Homer,"It's obvious what's happening. I'm being replaced by a younger, more in-your-face version of me."
Homer,Maybe five bucks would refresh my memory.
Homer,Who pays for that wedding?
Homer,"You're right. But just to be safe, maybe I should chain him up."
Homer,I think you're underreacting.
Homer,This session's under.
Homer,Badbye.
Homer,"No. No. Stay away from my wife, Bart."
Homer,That's the guy! That's the guy from my dream!
Homer,"Go ahead and smile, smart guy. I'm gonna mop you up like turkey gravy."
Homer,"Absolutely, sweetie."
Homer,"No, of course not. Now aim for your mother's heart."
Homer,"Oh, come on. You've been gunning for queen bee ever since you buzzed into this hive. Now serve!"
Homer,"Hey, leave my teammate alone!"
Homer,Babies.
Homer,Don't listen. It's a trick!
Homer,I think he's trying to psych you out.
Homer,"Well, look who's here. You two are goin' down."
Homer,Did you hear that? She said we're goin' down!
Homer,"Oh, that's loser talk!"
Homer,"Unbeatable, eh?"
Homer,"Comin' through... Hey, hi Otto... Sorry..."
Homer,"Hey, that's great. Listen, I need a new doubles partner. My little girl's a lead weight."
Homer,"Yeah, but only to crush my wife and son."
Homer,"Hm, you seem less disgusted. Let's go!"
Homer,Booo! You rot!
Homer,Up- bup...
Homer,"Now Lisa, dumping is such a harsh word. Let's just say I'm replacing you."
Homer,"Okay, swing. Run. Hit the thing. Now run across the..."
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Everybody's been dumped but me. I'm undumpable.
Homer,My tennis stick!
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,Which one am I? Serena or Venus?
Homer,You're a girl.
Homer,"You know, there's a lesson here for all of us: it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff."
Homer,Courtesy of Pete Sampras.
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,Sucker.
Homer,"Y'ello!... Hey, Moe. We're watching you on TV."
Homer,"So, how's that bowel obstruction doing?"
Homer,"Well, it all starts when the nulecule comes out of its nest..."
Homer,A world without Krusty -- what would that be like?
Homer,What's on TV?
Homer,Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
Homer,"Oh, yeah, uh, I was at the flower shop today, too. Yup, gettin' drunk at the ol' flower shop."
Homer,Take it off!
Homer,Go. Blow.
Homer,"38! That's roughly my age! Marge, after a lot of thought, I've decided to run the Springfield marathon."
Homer,"Stay out of this, Lisa. Marge, I've made up my mind. I'll do your job for a day, and you do mine. Then we'll see who has it tougher."
Homer,"Let's see. Sweatbands... check. Anti-chafing nipple tape... Check, check... and check."
Homer,"I can't believe it! I'm actually running a marathon! Oh, I hit the wall! This is so painful! Hey, I got my second wind. Another wall! I ju-- Woo hoo! Third wind!"
Homer,And thank you for assuming we're hip.
Homer,"All right, now here's the 411: I'm a record producer, see. I'm starting a new boy band and there's a place in it for Bart."
Homer,And my dream is to get rid of Bart.
Homer,How many lives must you ruin?
Homer,Will you two shut up? I'm missing precious VJ prattle.
Homer,YVAN EHT NIOJ. Ya gotta love that crazy chorus.
Homer,"Ah, it doesn't mean anything. It's like ""rama-lama ding dong"" or ""give peace a chance""."
Homer,"Wait a minute, Bart's band is brainwashing kids with subliminal messages? That's pretty farfetched, Lisa."
Homer,Here comes the jealousy bug. Gonna git ya! Gonna git ya!
Homer,I wanna go home now.
Homer,"So, ah, what songs did I miss?"
Homer,"Yeah, that's the look."
Homer,"Not ""MAD""! That's our nation's largest mental illness-themed humor magazine."
Homer,'Bout time.
Homer,Smelson! It's funny 'cause you smell.
Homer,Am I ever!
Homer,Kids... How would you... like to go to... Blockoland?!!
Homer,But... the TV gave me the impression that...
Homer,"Maggie, no!"
Homer,We're here.
Homer,I am a robot. Do what I say.
Homer,I am a washing machine. Do what I say.
Homer,Check it out. I built myself a healthy apple.
Homer,"Yep, a shiny new apple."
Homer,I get it. Everything's made of blocks. Even the water.
Homer,What are you gonna do about it?
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Leeches!
Homer,"Welcome to real life, Lisa. You can't fight city hall, AKA Blockoland. So don't even try."
Homer,It's what I always tell them. I told them that twice yesterday. And then again as they were going to sleep.
Homer,"You're right, honey. Hear that, kids? The Simpsons are going to Blockoland!"
Homer,'Scuse me.
Homer,You sold my little girl a shoddy Eiffel Tower.
Homer,"Yeah, you're right."
Homer,"But before I go, I'm gonna give you a little souvenir of my own."
Homer,"Hey, any friend of Marge is a friend of mine."
Homer,"So, how's that new block I got you?"
Homer,"You know, standing up for the little guy felt good. I'm gonna do it more often."
Homer,Those bullies are gone now!
Homer,"My heart was in the right place, jerk!"
Homer,"Well, you're welcome, honey. Now, I'm gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. Got a problem, Bart?"
Homer,"Don't worry, son. I'll handle this."
Homer,Come on! Why won't you go out with Bart?
Homer,"Please, ugly is such a smelly word. Who would you rather go out with?"
Homer,"Well duh! He's breathtaking, but Bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent."
Homer,"And face it, you're no prize either. You wear braces, you dress like a kid and you're not gettin' any younger. Take what you can get."
Homer,"They wouldn't? Well I'll go to bat for you, honey."
Homer,"Nice place you got here. Ooh look, a hair net. Be a shame if it was hurled to the ground!"
Homer,"Oh, how clumsy of me? And..."
Homer,Oops!
Homer,"Either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more lids will be unscrewed."
Homer,"Oh, really..."
Homer,"Boy, you weren't kidding. Your profit margins are razor-thin."
Homer,Wait a minute. Four hundred a month for loafer lightener?
Homer,You get the same results with a mincing gel.
Homer,The satisfaction of helping another human being is all the thanks I et cetera.
Homer,"And I gave that man directions, even though I didn't know the way. 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am this week."
Homer,"Say no more. I'll help you, Lenny."
Homer,I'm trying to get a refund for this ticket. Is this the executive office of the ball club?
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Well, is that it?"
Homer,Is...
Homer,I see.
Homer,I'm sorry to hear that.
Homer,"Yes, sir."
Homer,"Okay. So, uh, you wanna go get something to eat?"
Homer,Albuquerque Isotopes? What is all this stuff?
Homer,What a crazy room. There's no Albuquerque Isotopes. It's the Springfield... Ohhhh.
Homer,"You're moving the team to Albuquerque, aren't you?"
Homer,"Well, okay. But you can't silence Homer Simpson. I'm the friend of the downtrodden. And I'm not gonna forget what I saw here today."
Homer,Wait a minute. Will this erase my memory?
Homer,"Oh, my head. How long have I been out here?"
Homer,I was? But I love the swing.
Homer,"You know me. Occasionally, I'll be quirky. ""I'll be quirky..."" Albuquerque! I'll be right back!"
Homer,Members of the media...
Homer,...thank you for coming. The proof that the Isotopes are moving to Albuquerque is right behind this door.
Homer,"Yes, that is an important story. But so is this!"
Homer,"I don't mind being called a liar when I'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. But not when I'm telling the truth."
Homer,That's it! I'll go on a hunger strike.
Homer,"So? I can stop. And I will stop. I'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!"
Homer,Let's see those double A baseball honchos ignore this.
Homer,"My hunger strike will not end until Duff admits they're moving the team. Bart, my chains."
Homer,Now it begins.
Homer,"Man, he really hates Wayne Rogers."
Homer,Don't worry. Duff's not gonna let me waste away to nothing.
Homer,Hey kid and man!
Homer,Don't support a team run by liars!
Homer,They're secretly planning to move to Albuquerque.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"Oh, so hungry... Can't give up... Must continue fighting evil corporation."
Homer,"Nice try, God."
Homer,But Homer Simpson doesn't give in to temptation that easily... Hey!
Homer,Stop that!
Homer,DANCIN' AWAY MY HUNGER PANGS / MOVIN' MY FEET SO MY STOMACH WON'T HURT / I'M KINDA LIKE JESUS / BUT NOT IN A SACRILEGIOUS WAY...
Homer,I'm soooo hungry.
Homer,What's going on? What am I doin' here?
Homer,What?! That's not why I'm here!
Homer,They're moving the team to Albuquerque!
Homer,All this hunger for nothin'.
Homer,Do they have to chew so loud?
Homer,"Oh, I'm wasting away. I'm down to a B-cup."
Homer,"Oh, I'm so hungry. Oh, why keep starving myself? No one cares."
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,Why do you look like Cesar Romero?
Homer,Why are you here?
Homer,But I wanna!
Homer,What's happening? Did I crush your corporation?
Homer,Me so hungee.
Homer,"So hard to resist. Mesquite-grilled onions... jalapeño relish... Wait a minute, those are Southwestern ingredients!"
Homer,Mango-lime salsa?! That's the kind of bold flavor they enjoy in... Albuquerque!
Homer,"Tell the truth! C'mon, everybody!"
Homer,"Don't listen to him, Duffman. For once in your life, stand up for the little guy!"
Homer,The truth never tasted so good!
Homer,What can you do? Sex sells.
Homer,"They said if I come in late again, I'm fired. I can't take that chance."
Homer,Kids gone?
Homer,You read my mind. Sooo...
Homer,"This coffee's good, huh?"
Homer,"You know, I think our marriage is..."
Homer,I got it!
Homer,"No, I do!"
Homer,"Okay, now. Put..."
Homer,You...you really scared us.
Homer,That's a pretty big caboose for a baby.
Homer,Noooo!
Homer,This is such an eye-opener. I always pictured the kids dying in the living room.
Homer,Three dollars? That doesn't seem so bad.
Homer,Mm hm. Hmmmm.
Homer,We don't need your high-priced safety junk!
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"Now don't feel bad, honey. Did you know back in grade school, I had a bully problem myself?"
Homer,EVERYBODY WAS KUNG-FU FIGHTING...
Homer,THOSE CATS WERE FAST AS LIGHTNING...
Homer,Good times.
Homer,That baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us safety covers for the electrical outlets.
Homer,But I'll just draw bunny faces on them to scare Maggie away.
Homer,She will be.
Homer,"See, honey, Daddy's protecting you from all the sharp scary things. Here, hold this a sec."
Homer,"Ow! Oh, my..."
Homer,"Okay Maggie, put it down."
Homer,It...
Homer,Down.
Homer,"Oh. Okay, that's quite enough, it's not funny anymore."
Homer,Now do you realize how unsafe the American home is? Baby accidents occur every three minutes.
Homer,"Yeah, but this is me talking. Look, I already encased the telephone in concrete."
Homer,Reach into these holes. I use a carrot.
Homer,Baby could order poison.
Homer,"Of course you are. Marge, I've finally discovered the reason God made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. And I've got to share that gift with the world."
Homer,Get her outta here.
Homer,"Savin' those babies. And the soft spots on their heads do, do, do, do do..."
Homer,Problem: a pointy deity. And I've got the perfect solution.
Homer,"Yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round Buddha."
Homer,"So am I, but I don't get all huffy about it."
Homer,Canceled.
Homer,That's me! Safety dance!
Homer,YOU CAN DANCE / YOU CAN DANCE / EVERYBODY LOOK AT YOUR PANTS.
Homer,"Dear God, what have I done?"
Homer,Babies of Springfield! We need your help! Please! Skin your knees! Put dice up your nose! Let cats sleep on your face!
Homer,Woo hoo! Simpsons rule! Sorry.
Homer,So all her bullying was just to get some attention.
Homer,Just to get some attention.
Homer,Pound that nerd.
Homer,"""Olive oil?"" ""Asparagus?"" If your mother wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people."
Homer,"Well, okay, but get five bags in case we eat four on the way home."
Homer,In the cart.
Homer,Cart.
Homer,"My doctor says, and my garage mechanic agrees, that..."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Y'know, I always felt sorry for Marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun."
Homer,"Wait, I changed my mind."
Homer,Stack it in the order I'll eat it driving home.
Homer,The customer's always right. That's what everybody likes about us. Now mush!
Homer,Hurry up. I can't stand here jabbing you all day.
Homer,No you don't...
Homer,"No, I can handle it. I'll get you, squealer."
Homer,"Oh, the bag boys are on strike! I'm shaking."
Homer,If I can have this rubber stick.
Homer,So hungry... There's gotta be some food left. Sulfur jerky... Cream of toast... Where did we get all this crap?
Homer,Good boy. Good boy. Show us where the food is.
Homer,Where? Over there?
Homer,Hey!
Homer,Yoink.
Homer,My old lunch box!
Homer,That Amos Burke made his own rules.
Homer,Very old animal crackers!
Homer,Mmmm... turbulent.
Homer,Ow! What the hell?
Homer,Africa? They're bound to have food there!
Homer,"And on my free African safari, I want to do everything on this box."
Homer,"I want to shoot a lion in the face, fight Muhammad Ali, and ride in a convertible with two happy zebras."
Homer,Your box made promises of a vacational nature. And I expect you to live up to them.
Homer,Ow! My eye!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Hey, mister?"
Homer,"On the plane, I'm gonna need two seats... for the twins."
Homer,The Simpsons are going to Africa!
Homer,Just like Jimmy Carter.
Homer,That's okay. I got 'em.
Homer,"Eh, bound to happen."
Homer,Wowww... It just rolled over to ten thousand.
Homer,"What did you just see, Lisa?"
Homer,What did you just see?
Homer,GLIBBIE GLOP GLOOPIE / NIBBIE NABBIE NOOBIE / LA LE LO LO LO.
Homer,"Now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. Whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born."
Homer,"I've got more bones than that guy. If you're trying to impress me, you've failed."
Homer,You have failed.
Homer,"By the way, what kind of blood is this?"
Homer,"Yeah, it's like the Allman Brothers!"
Homer,"A hungry, hungry hippo!"
Homer,Help! Kitenge!
Homer,Good ol' Kitenge.
Homer,Quick! Into the river! Hippos hate water.
Homer,It's working!
Homer,Leeches!
Homer,"Okay, here's the situation: We're hopelessly lost and about to die."
Homer,Don't worry. Being eaten by a crocodile is just like going to sleep... in a giant blender.
Homer,I've got a map!
Homer,"Monkey. Now, according to Animal Crackers, there's no river here."
Homer,"So, you think they settled that bag boy strike yet?"
Homer,Here's why they shouldn't get anything. One...
Homer,This flower saved our lives.
Homer,Not a chance.
Homer,It's a flower.
Homer,"I told you, yes. Now Bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel."
Homer,Go.
Homer,Or... more mouthwatering monkeys.
Homer,Overtime for bag boys? Ridiculous!
Homer,"So, I notice your home smells of feces."
Homer,And not just monkey feces either.
Homer,You must be the most boring woman on earth.
Homer,"I mean I knew scientists wasted their lives, but geez."
Homer,Anything for these noble animals.
Homer,So like us...
Homer,Somebody light this monkey.
Homer,Help! Bad monkey!
Homer,"Look at me, I'm a scientist!"
Homer,What a nice lady.
Homer,"Hey, look! Our tour guide got a new job."
Homer,I was wondering what became of him.
Homer,"Now he's just a stinking flight attendant! Hey, where's my pillow?"
Homer,Breakfast!
Homer,Aww... Cereal? You know I like my breakfast fried or chicken-fried!
Homer,"No, Lisa, but I sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast."
Homer,"Well, let's put him to the test. Me love beer."
Homer,"Aw, he loves beer."
Homer,"Here, little fella."
Homer,I'm sorry. I thought he was a party robot.
Homer,"Ooo, can I have a brownie?"
Homer,"Ooo, can I have dinner?"
Homer,Homer wants a brownie! I'm gonna get one!
Homer,Comin' in from the left.
Homer,Or is it the right?
Homer,Look out for the reach-around!
Homer,"He shoots, he sco-- My thumb!"
Homer,Oh God oh God oh God!
Homer,"Sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, Marge!"
Homer,"Reattach a thumb? This isn't ""Gattaca."""
Homer,"Okay boy, drop the thumb..."
Homer,Nobody's gonna tackle you.
Homer,Come back with my thumb!
Homer,"Come on! Come on, boy! Oh, please give it back. You want people food? I can get you people food."
Homer,I have nothing he wants.
Homer,Give me back my thumb!
Homer,Gaa!
Homer,"Okay, if the doctor asks why you cut it off, you caught me in bed with four beautiful women."
Homer,"Marge, over here."
Homer,But I have finger insurance!
Homer,"Symmetry, eh?"
Homer,We need more ice! My thumb is fading fast.
Homer,"Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb!"
Homer,"Thanks, Moe."
Homer,"Well, I really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss and all... Although I do like the occasional beer..."
Homer,"Did you ever see that ""Blue Man Group?"" Total rip-off of the Smurfs. And the Smurfs? They suck."
Homer,I've gotta get to Dr. Nick's!
Homer,"Where's Marge?! That is so rude. I know, I'll hitchhike."
Homer,"Oh, why isn't this working?"
Homer,"Hey, thanks for stopping."
Homer,"Oh, crap. It's on fire!"
Homer,Can you drive me to Shelbyville Hospital?
Homer,Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
Homer,It's too late.
Homer,"Well, old friend, we always knew this day would come."
Homer,Say goodbye to your brother.
Homer,What in the hell was that?
Homer,"Linguo, dead!"
Homer,"No, Lisa, but I sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast."
Homer,"Here, little fella."
Homer,"I'm sorry. I thought he was a party robot, like in that play I wrote."
Homer,My thumb!
Homer,"Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb."
Homer,"Did you ever see that ""Blue Man Group?"""
Homer,Abra-ca-thumbra.
Homer,Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
Homer,What the hell...?
Homer,"Linguo, dead!"
Homer,"Oh, thank goodness everyone's okay!"
Homer,"One Tower of Babel, and build it to Heaven."
Homer,To Heaven!
Homer,Christ be with you.
Homer,Leave Ned alone.
Homer,He can't admit he likes her till he's sure she likes him back. And there's only one way to find out.
Homer,Does -- Rachel -- like -- Ned?
Homer,"Flanders has cooties, Flanders has cooties."
Homer,"Hey, she's coming this way!"
Homer,"Ooh, she wants to know how your life is going."
Homer,"Ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime."
Homer,"He can hear you, Rachel."
Homer,Hotel? Why don't you just stay at Ned's place?
Homer,"Yeah, maybe it was too soon."
Homer,"Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?"
Homer,"Say bye, Mr. Flanders."
Homer,"Yeah, a lifetime of memories."
Homer,"Sure, of course I do, but life goes on, ashes to ashes, turn, turn, turn, long live rock, and so forth."
Homer,"Man, this is taking forever. I know how to speed things up."
Homer,Now for the awkward part. We gotta talk about money.
Homer,What? That doesn't sound like me.
Homer,Ahh... Is that a fact? And you think you know someone.
Homer,"Hey, how 'bout that?"
Homer,You're doing that the sucker way. Try a little vitamin G.
Homer,"Relax. It's a ""controlled burn""... Uh-oh."
Homer,"Uh, yeah, teenagers."
Homer,She's still bossing you around from beyond the grave? Can they do that?
Homer,I am. I'd be glad to spearhead the entire begging initiative.
Homer,No problem. I'll need a sack and something sharp.
Homer,"Oh yeah, those guys and their crazy scams."
Homer,Do I detect a hint of cinnamon?
Homer,"Don't say that, Ned!"
Homer,"I'm sorry, the ticket price doesn't cover visions, miracles, or other Godly hoo-hah."
Homer,"Oh, why not? Everybody's doin' it."
Homer,Stupid grill!
Homer,Why won't you light? The gas is on full blast!
Homer,Good idea.
Homer,Could get hurt. Could. There's a chance they won't.
Homer,"Ned, Praiseland has touched an entire town with its inspiring message and toxic super-freakouts. Look at those smiling faces."
Homer,Rich laughing with poor...
Homer,Bullies breaking bread with nerds...
Homer,Orphans lighting candles over a leaking gas line... Lighting candles!
Homer,Christ be with you.
Homer,"Ooo, Ned, look who's here. It's that girl you don't like... not!"
Homer,I think Ned is gonna be all right...
Homer,You got that right
Homer,"Pick me! Pick me! I've got hoop dreams, coach. I've got 'em bad."
Homer,"Yes! Losers! Lo-sers! Lo-sers! L-- You said ""Homer,"" right?"
Homer,Lo-sers!
Homer,"Woo! You da man, Carl. I believe you can fly."
Homer,"Okay guys, I've got a secret play I've been saving for the Olympics or possibly the Final Four, and it goes something like this... Uh, Skinner I want you... Moe, you can take ... Homer, you can take Groundskeeper Willie. No way am I taking Groundskeeper Willie. Yes you are. Are you a team player or not?"
Homer,"Eat my dust, mortals!"
Homer,I'm okay.
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Did you say anterior?
Homer,Mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory.
Homer,"I don't know, I'm still a little hazy."
Homer,"Oh, yeah. Now I remember it like it was yesterday..."
Homer,"Hey man, you're harshin' my buzz. Anyway it all started when..."
Homer,Jet-son!
Homer,Maybe a little morphine would get me there quicker.
Homer,Miss work? But my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.
Homer,"But ""Dr. Screwlittle"" sounded like a delightful romp. Well, you don't have to worry about the bill. We've never welshed on a... Look, a bear!"
Homer,Run!
Homer,"Two weeks?! Well, what am I supposed to do? Just sit on my ass and watch TV? That ain't my style, man!"
Homer,No they don't.
Homer,Everyone's having fun but me.
Homer,"Well, I can still hang out with you guys."
Homer,I'm so bored.
Homer,"This place is so boring. I've gotta do something to keep from going crazy. I know, I'll breed the pets. To each other."
Homer,"Soon I will have a miracle hybrid, with the loyalty of a cat and the cleanliness of a dog."
Homer,"No, that's not how ya do it."
Homer,Quitters!
Homer,"Oh, it feels so good to talk to another human being. Stupid Flanders."
Homer,"Well, Marge isn't here. She had to identify a body at the morgue."
Homer,"Well, they would keep me company. And this pickle you're offering only sweetens the deal."
Homer,"Sure, knock yourselves out, and call me Homer."
Homer,"Daddy's not here, is he?"
Homer,That is the darnedest thing!
Homer,"Yeah, well. How was the concert?"
Homer,"Hey, it was fun. My kids are sick of all my stories. But they just can't get enough of me!"
Homer,Don't tell me what I'm not doing.
Homer,"Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
Homer,"Then I'll do it, just to see the look on your face."
Homer,That's the one.
Homer,"It's just a legal thing, to protect me."
Homer,See for yourself.
Homer,Sure. Go for the gusto.
Homer,It knows you're afraid.
Homer,"Aw, aren't they sweet. Any medical things I should know about?"
Homer,"I owe it all to my rewarding work with children, and not picking at it."
Homer,Wonderful. Being with those kids gives me a high only morphine can top. Ya got any?
Homer,Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!
Homer,Peek-a-boo!
Homer,Okay. IS THAT ALL THERE IS? / IS THAT ALL THERE IS? / IF THAT'S ALL THERE IS / MY FRIEND / THEN LET'S KEEP DANCING...
Homer,"Yes, but then I discovered the joys of raising children."
Homer,"Don't worry honey, you'll have children of your own someday. Then you'll know my joy."
Homer,If you're happy and you know it say a swear!
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Aw, what a beautiful frame. Perfect for my day care permit. Sweet."
Homer,Umm-hm.
Homer,"Hang on, everybody. Three, two, one... Blast off!"
Homer,"Aw, that's my girl."
Homer,Is there a snack table?
Homer,Don't film this.
Homer,"'Cause the thing is, there are no bad kids..."
Homer,Sorry. Daddy thought you were a pile of cable.
Homer,My kids wear these hearts to remind them they are always loved.
Homer,"Yes, through the magic of caring."
Homer,I'll mace you good!
Homer,"Please let me win this, Lord. 'Cause if you don't..."
Homer,Yes!
Homer,All my love has come back in trophy form.
Homer,I'll call.
Homer,I almost had a straight!
Homer,"Hey, what's the deal?"
Homer,"Well, I'd rather reserve judgement until I... oh my God!"
Homer,That is completely taken out of context!
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,No! No! No one is taking my kids from me!
Homer,"Run, children! Run!"
Homer,Uh... For frosty chocolate milkshakes. Frosty chocolate milkshakes!
Homer,I'll tell you where we're not going: jail.
Homer,Uh oh.
Homer,"Why did you rat me out, kids? Was it because I showered love on those other children while ignoring you?"
Homer,"Well, I learned my lesson. From now on you two are the only kids I'll care about. Oh, and Maggie."
Homer,Now let's all enjoy the snack table while we still have it.
Homer,"Yeah, that'll happen."
Homer,Teamsters.
Homer,The Simpsons are going to Delaware!
Homer,"Hey, wait a minute. ""Airport tax, five dollars?"""
Homer,"Well, we are not boarding that plane unless you waive that tax. Waive it..."
Homer,Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws.
Homer,The Simpsons are ridin' the rails!
Homer,What are you gonna do to us?
Homer,"Man, buffalo are easy to kill."
Homer,"All right, but your next story better be worth it."
Homer,"Oh, this'll be good."
Homer,Whoopsie.
Homer,A poor delicious buffalo. He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.
Homer,"I haven't had buffalo in six hours. Marge, how 'bout whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed buffal-O.J."
Homer,What have I done? What have I done?!
Homer,Aww...
Homer,Big deal.
Homer,I liked that story 'cause I was a Judge.
Homer,I'll meet you in Wilmington.
Homer,"Raise your arm... Okay, the other one..."
Homer,"Oh, it shows. I was gonna say something, but I thought it might sound you know, weird."
Homer,It--
Homer,Ew!
Homer,"And it's important to feel good about yourself... Okay, spread your toes. Do you know how much glass is in here?"
Homer,"Ah, Ethnictown. Where hard-working immigrants dream of becoming lazy, overfed Americans."
Homer,"Wait, this is just a shaved puppy."
Homer,"The perfect crime. Marge, I have to be in court next Tuesday."
Homer,"A fortune teller? Oh, no you don't. This phony gypsy just wants to rip you off. See, this wart is a fake!"
Homer,So much for the legendary gypsy hospitality.
Homer,Beads!
Homer,Owww!
Homer,"Hey, that's me. And that's you."
Homer,What-ever.
Homer,Are you coming on to me?
Homer,Good as new.
Homer,"Well, I... There. Right as rain, there."
Homer,"Marge, that ""curse"" is just a lot of silly superstition. Right Lisa?"
Homer,"Guys, I am not cursed!"
Homer,"Oh, Moe, they're dead! And it's all my fault!"
Homer,When did that happen?
Homer,Let's make sure he's a leprechaun. Sing us a song of the Emerald Isle.
Homer,"Ah, 'tis like the singin' of the angels themselves."
Homer,"Good idea, Mr. Ed. Wanna come along, Noodle Neck?"
Homer,"I know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge, Irish-style!"
Homer,Yah!
Homer,"Wake up, ya lousy drunk!"
Homer,Ew! Nasty!
Homer,Yep. Everything worked out for the best.
Homer,"Well, me saying I'm sorry won't bring him back."
Homer,She's not the boss of me.
Homer,"Mm, various eggs."
Homer,Trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the smartest thing we ever did!
Homer,"Oh, I agree."
Homer,"Yeah, that's the price of success."
Homer,What's my blood alcohol?
Homer,Keep 'em comin'.
Homer,"Yeah, she's cool."
Homer,"Lucky, shmucky. I knocked her up. But she's stuck now -- we're married, till death do us part. But if I died, she'd be completely free. For man or machine."
Homer,"Yep, a machine."
Homer,"Mm, unexplained bacon."
Homer,Good ol' table.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Yep. Man one, machine zero. How do you like that score?"
Homer,"Die, you monster!"
Homer,"Well, I am missing the back of my head. I think you could cut me some slack."
Homer,"Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this."
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, these kids are pretty special..."
Homer,My sweet little angel!
Homer,"Hey, we stayed for your kids!"
Homer,"WON'T YOU MARRY ME, BI-ILL? / I GOT THE WEDDING GOWN BI-ILL / 'CAUSE WEDDINGS ARE NI-ICE..."
Homer,"Didja hear that, Pengy? Forty dollars!"
Homer,"End of the line, boys."
Homer,I love our court days.
Homer,Judge Snyder? While we're young?
Homer,I'll bring the car around.
Homer,What'd she say about cupcakes?
Homer,"Uh, your Honor, I was chasing the KBBL Party Penguin Prize Patrol."
Homer,And a Blue Oyster Cult medallion.
Homer,Coooool.
Homer,"Your Honor, if I may sing a little bit of ""Don't Fear the Reaper"", I think you'll agree that..."
Homer,I couldn't agree more. Perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.
Homer,It won't?
Homer,Tethered?!
Homer,Room five?!
Homer,It's a little tight.
Homer,I used to be.
Homer,"Oh, this punishment is so cruel."
Homer,I'll medicate you...
Homer,"...honey. You know, this could be fun. Race you to the kitchen, my little tether ball."
Homer,Bo-ring.
Homer,"Come on, these kids are never gonna use that stuff."
Homer,Fine.
Homer,Cobras!
Homer,"Okay, son. Concentrate... Shut out everything but the sound of my criticism."
Homer,Swing!
Homer,"Run, Bart! Pump your thighs! Pump them..."
Homer,"I'm with you, son!"
Homer,That's my boy...
Homer,"C'mon, hug me..."
Homer,Cobras! Cobras!
Homer,Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ah! Ow! Ow! Owww! That really hurt.
Homer,I thought I would hate working nights. But it's so peaceful. And there's no one here to squeal on me for shootin' mice.
Homer,"Sure, boy."
Homer,"Oh, son. You know that's none of your business. Say, is that our house?"
Homer,"Oh, yeah... I forget things sometimes..."
Homer,Really. You like skateboards? We're sure learning a lot about each other.
Homer,"Ow, my head... Oh. I need a beer."
Homer,"I hit my head, Moe."
Homer,Since when?
Homer,"All right, all right. Come on, Bart."
Homer,That's my little slugger.
Homer,"Hey, knock it off! These pants cost six hundred dollars!"
Homer,"Yeah, they're Italian."
Homer,Moe? What the?...
Homer,It's about time. Oh.
Homer,"Well, that's a pretty big ""if,"" honey."
Homer,"Oh, I just got comfortable. Use the bottle."
Homer,No!
Homer,Fine. I don't even know why we have a bottle. Somebody tell me!
Homer,"Ah, son, it's a little chilly. Maybe you should wrap a blanket around your head."
Homer,What's the big deal? He sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.
Homer,Why not? Kids are very visual these days.
Homer,But...
Homer,"Hey, shut up."
Homer,Ow! Why you--!
Homer,Because I... Ow! You--!
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,We're free! Your mother set us free!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Heyyy, how 'bout that? Ha, ha."
Homer,"But, Constance, it only happened because..."
Homer,"Wait. I'm to blame, Judge. You see, I was pressuring my wife to make love in front of our son... you're gonna laugh when you hear this... when suddenly..."
Homer,I admit it.
Homer,"Your Honor, I'd like to be tried separately."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,"Well, that explains the sign."
Homer,"You know, we could get out of these stupid things if you'd just tell the judge you're a bad mother. And you don't even have to say ""bad."" It could be ""negligent"" or ""unfit"" or ""drugged-up."""
Homer,You're right. It's time to stand up to that firm-breasted judge.
Homer,Easy... easy...
Homer,"Shhh, you'll wake up Flanders..."
Homer,"Hey, Marge, surf's up!"
Homer,"Well, we tried all those other tools."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Now, time for ""Operation: Judge-Get-Back-At."""
Homer,"Okay, she lives at one Ocean View Drive. Let's start skulking."
Homer,"It's only the milkman. Hey, maybe I should be a milkman."
Homer,This address must be wrong.
Homer,"She lives in a houseboat? Wow, she is so cool."
Homer,"I know, I know. Fight the power."
Homer,Cops!
Homer,"Look at her in there, washing her body..."
Homer,"I hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's only one way to describe a nasty super witch like her."
Homer,"Oh, it's just a friendly seal."
Homer,Shut-uuuup...
Homer,"Oh Lord, guide this cinder block..."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Hey, how ya doin'?"
Homer,So... it cost you nothin'.
Homer,That was close.
Homer,"Just the radio, dear."
Homer,"The bridge column. Oh, that South. You never know what he'll do next. Hm... Aw. Look at that dad in ""Drabble."" He's like an unfunny version of me."
Homer,Probably digging for drugs.
Homer,No. Of course not.
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. I'll find out what he's up to. Kids shouldn't have secrets."
Homer,"Oh hello, young man. Beautiful day for digging, isn't it?"
Homer,"Yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?"
Homer,"So, I guess you wouldn't mind if I was to dig a hole of my own."
Homer,Maybe I will.
Homer,Very little.
Homer,I'm having chest pains!
Homer,Where's the defibrillator?
Homer,Clear!
Homer,This thing pays for itself.
Homer,"Yes. Eventually, I became King of the Morlocks."
Homer,"You callin' me a liar, Carl?"
Homer,"Oh, I just naturally assumed."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Geez Moe, you've been a real crank lately."
Homer,"Now, ya see, that's what I'm talkin' about. You're always pointing that shotgun at us."
Homer,Maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.
Homer,That was an amazing throw.
Homer,"Hey, where'd that painting come from?"
Homer,"Ooh, ooh, pick me!"
Homer,Can do. Now don't you worry about a thing.
Homer,No Moe. You've got it all wrong. People buy beer from you.
Homer,I thought you said you had to go.
Homer,"Man, when's the last time Moe cleaned this?"
Homer,"Oh, I don't know. What would Moe say about that?"
Homer,"But on the other hand, Moe's not here."
Homer,For what? A little splattered food never hurt anybody. Now everybody shut up and dance!
Homer,Don't worry. You gotta hit it just right. Like Fonzie.
Homer,Ayyy!
Homer,Oh! Whoa! Hemorrhage-amundo!
Homer,Ayyy.
Homer,Yello?
Homer,"Ooo, Bart! My first prank call. What do I do?"
Homer,I don't get it.
Homer,What's the gag?
Homer,"I'M A WALKIN' DOWN THE STREET, GONNA OPEN MOE'S BAR / I'M A SINGIN' WHAT I'M THINKIN' / HEY, LOOK AT THAT DOG."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Teenage vandals smashing the bar! Moe's gonna kill me.
Homer,You dirty teen.
Homer,Moe? Wrecking Moe's bar?
Homer,"Wow, well I I almost fainted, but then I didn't. What are you doing?"
Homer,"And it would look pretty, too."
Homer,"Hi, Formico."
Homer,Sorry. He seems nice.
Homer,"It's not fair. Just when I was getting to be the world's greatest bartender, it's all snatched away."
Homer,"Freshen your drink, pal?"
Homer,"There you go, doll."
Homer,"Look, buddy, I don't care where you go, but you can't sleep here."
Homer,"Wow, It looks like an alien headquarters. Couldn't you just see aliens runnin' out of there? Couldn't ya? Hey, wait up."
Homer,Not for friends of Moe's.
Homer,Don't you know who I am?
Homer,Cecil is a girl's name.
Homer,Um... the rabbits are cute.
Homer,"Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff."
Homer,"Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff."
Homer,"Okay, look cool."
Homer,That's it!
Homer,I'm gonna tell Moe exactly what I think of his...
Homer,"Moe, we want our bar back."
Homer,"Oh, so you're ashamed of us. Well, you've turned into a big phony."
Homer,"I'll throw myself out, thank you."
Homer,I believe I had a hat.
Homer,Suckers!
Homer,I think it's pretty obvious. I'm turning our garage into a tavern. The kind Moe's used to be.
Homer,It's not about spite. It's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor Moe. Now help me nail up this urinal.
Homer,Beautiful.
Homer,"But when I'm passionate about something, I see it through to the end."
Homer,'CAUSE MOE'S A BIG JERK AND A SHE-MALE TOO!
Homer,Barkeep!
Homer,"It's the family bar. Right, kids?"
Homer,As soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.
Homer,"She's so sleepy, she doesn't know what she's saying. Hee, hee."
Homer,We're rockin' great!
Homer,I told them it was a benefit. They think they're saving the rainforest.
Homer,Seems to me I already did.
Homer,"Bar? I see no bar. This is a hunting club...Which is permitted by state law ""to serve beverages of a refreshing nature."""
Homer,"Which I'll be doing tomorrow morning, smart guy."
Homer,Lemons...
Homer,It's the law. My hands are tied.
Homer,"Okay, cranberry sauce, stuffing, potatoes. Come on, turkey. Join your friends."
Homer,I would.
Homer,"Here, turkey, turkey... Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey..."
Homer,Nobody's gonna kill you.
Homer,"All right turkey. Where are you? Turkeys, the only animal smarter than man."
Homer,What the hell is that?
Homer,A turkey!
Homer,"A cougar! Die, cougar!"
Homer,Got that cat right in the leg.
Homer,"Oh, no! This time I really am gonna faint!"
Homer,Son of a...
Homer,"I'm sorry I shot you, Moe."
Homer,"Hey, who invited the hippies?"
Homer,"All right, I'm sorry... but I will not save the rainforest."
Homer,"And I'm thankful I get to spend Thanksgiving with my family, these alternative rockers, and my favorite bartender."
Homer,And here you go.
Homer,"Ah. And now to read my fortune. ""Geese can be troublesome."" What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
Homer,"Well, I knew that before I came in here. A guy outside told me that."
Homer,"Oh, these fortunes are terrible."
Homer,"These fortunes are terrible. They're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness."
Homer,Easy.
Homer,You will be aroused by a shampoo commercial.
Homer,"Okay, let's see... ""The price of stamps will climb ever higher."""
Homer,"Let's see. ""You will invent a humorous toilet lid."" ""You will find true love on Flag Day."" ""Your store is being robbed, Apu."" Are you getting all this, Lisa?"
Homer,Stop that dog! It has my gum!
Homer,"Yes, Mr. Burns."
Homer,Ummm...
Homer,Oh! Yeah. Monty's a wild man! Yeah!
Homer,"Oh. He ran his own casino, stole the Loch Ness Monster, got shot by a baby, and blotted out the sun."
Homer,"C'mon, he's a total player."
Homer,Windowsill.
Homer,"Burns wants me to come along on his date, to show him where hip young people go."
Homer,You're right.
Homer,These would stop Joan Collins herself.
Homer,"Yep, no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man Burns."
Homer,"Yes, Mr. Burns."
Homer,"Oh, sorry."
Homer,No problem.
Homer,"But Mr. Burns, you're exhausted."
Homer,Can I have some ice cream? I finished my pizza.
Homer,You're going to ask her to marry you?!
Homer,Are you sure you wanna do this so fast?
Homer,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Homer,Let go of her or I'll scream!
Homer,"Well, this is my house. Ah--"
Homer,"Ohh... Geez, I just wanted to escape."
Homer,Pistol whip?!
Homer,Mmm... pistol whip.
Homer,"Wow, who do you have to kill to get a place like this?"
Homer,You know what would be surprising? A foot massage.
Homer,"Um, has the ship sailed on my foot massage suggestion?"
Homer,Hmm...
Homer,Good fire. Good fire. Keep burning. Almost there.
Homer,Just a little more.
Homer,"Wow, Mr. Burns, how did you do that?"
Homer,What about the wiener? A guy on TV lifted a can of paint with his.
Homer,"Oh, I know."
Homer,You mean a Van Dyke?
Homer,"Marge, a bee almost stung me today. I felt the wind go right by my ear."
Homer,"Ooo, that's quite a hug, honey..."
Homer,"Hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! Well I can fantasize too."
Homer,"Ooo, Mama Celeste."
Homer,"Love? ""Signed photo""?! Marge hasn't asked me for a signed photo in months! Well I'll show her!"
Homer,"Hello. This is Chad Sexington, the model for Burly Paper Towels."
Homer,I don't know. But I was quite moved by your letter. I'd love to meet you and your family. Shall we say dinner?
Homer,Perfect. I'll be there at seven.
Homer,"I was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of Chad Sexington. Do you mind?"
Homer,"So, how was your day? Did anything unbelievable happen? Phone calls, things of that nature?"
Homer,"Tonight? Well, you better get your hopes up."
Homer,That's him.
Homer,"Why look, it's Chad Sexington!"
Homer,"It was hard on me, too. I had to wear a suit. Oh, you're right. I've gotta make it up to her."
Homer,"How about Benihana, where dinner is the show?"
Homer,"No, huh?"
Homer,"Yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings."
Homer,Zing! What's a Skeletor?
Homer,Do me! Do me!
Homer,I am in your power. Boss me around.
Homer,"Look at me, I'm a famous historian! Out of my way!"
Homer,"Look at me, I'm Angie Dickinson! Out of my way!"
Homer,I'm twelve years old... I'm with my friends. It's a beautiful summer day at the old swimming hole... Oh my God!
Homer,"Oh, that's better..."
Homer,Here you go.
Homer,Huh?... There have been so many classic Simpson moments. I remember that time I tried to jump over Springfield gorge...
Homer,"Hm, twelve... Well, I remember I used to go hiking a lot with these two guys. With these two guys."
Homer,"It was one of those lazy summer days you thought would last forever. And to kill the boredom, we sang."
Homer,"Wait a minute. I remember falling in the mud, but I don't think that's why I've been screaming..."
Homer,Something else happened in that quarry... something... else...
Homer,Hey come on...
Homer,"It's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses..."
Homer,"Oh, hey, you guys can come with us."
Homer,"Bye, Moe."
Homer,"Yep, the old quarry is just a stone's throw away."
Homer,Never!
Homer,This is it. This is the old quarry.
Homer,Someone's yellow belly is showing.
Homer,And it's empty. Put it back! I don't wanna see it this way.
Homer,And someone has eaten the flesh.
Homer,"Now do you believe dead rats float, Lisa?"
Homer,"Ooh, a movie! I call the couch!"
Homer,"Now the movie's turned into a play! Still good, though."
Homer,"Well Marge, we solved the case of the haunted quarry."
Homer,Why? He'd just bury it.
Homer,Seems kinda pointless now.
Homer,Did you really make that envelope? 'Cause it says Hammermill over here.
Homer,"WHEN YOU HAVE A RIB-EYE STEAK / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / OH, THAT MEATLOAF TASTED GREAT / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / NOW FLOSS IT, FLOSS IT GOOD."
Homer,"Just a second, son. I've gotta put on my contacts."
Homer,Science!?
Homer,"Mmmm, pie pants."
Homer,"This is Launch Master Homer, counting down. Five, four, three..."
Homer,Two... one...
Homer,"The word ""unblowupable"" is thrown around a lot these days, but I think I can say with confidence..."
Homer,"Okay, that shows you what could potentially happen."
Homer,What was that?
Homer,"I have eyes, don't I?"
Homer,I would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.
Homer,"Dweeb, wonk, spaz... it's all good."
Homer,"Super. Now if you'll gather around, I'd like to say a few words. All nerds clear the launch area."
Homer,"Now all we need is our astronaut. Bart, where's America's newest hero?"
Homer,"Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God."
Homer,"Five, four, three, two, one... COUNTDOWN!"
Homer,"Okay Nibbles, you can guide her down. Step one: Right in front of you is a blue handle. Pull for a controlled burn of two point four seconds..."
Homer,"Don't worry, I planned for this."
Homer,You say that so much it's lost all meaning.
Homer,'Cause he's all man.
Homer,"Quiet, Lisa. Everyone in the store is looking at you!"
Homer,I don't know how to feel.
Homer,Got it.
Homer,How was that?
Homer,"So, you think you know better than this family, huh. Well, as long as you're in my house, you'll do what I do and believe what I believe. So butter your bacon!"
Homer,"Hold that thought. Bacon up that sausage, boy."
Homer,Wha?! That's it. No more chat rooms for you.
Homer,I think this tree could use an angel.
Homer,It's go time.
Homer,I don't know what Santa left you. I just know his name is Clip-Clop and he loves sugar.
Homer,Bag's in the kitchen.
Homer,I did it. I found our dog. Now our Christmas is complete.
Homer,So you're back on the winning team?
Homer,That's all I ever asked.
Homer,A grizzly bear with a chainsaw. Now there's a killing machine!
Homer,No problem. There's plenty of activities inside.
Homer,The TV!
Homer,Quit trying to control me.
Homer,New shooter.
Homer,"Oh, we'll see about that."
Homer,"One, two, three."
Homer,"I'm good for the rest, you know I am."
Homer,They told me it would be like this on the outside.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Police brutality! And chew-tality!
Homer,You got that right.
Homer,Stanford.
Homer,A heavenly choir. You must be an angel!
Homer,"No, you are an angel like Denzel Washington in ""The Preacher's Wife,"" or Will Smith in ""Bagger Vance,"" or Slimer in ""Ghostbusters."""
Homer,"Don't blame me, blame Tinseltown and its second golden age. May it never end."
Homer,"Okay Gabriel, this is a ""bar."" It's where I go to drink ""alcohol,"" which is the mortal equivalent of your ambrosia."
Homer,"Well, not with that temper."
Homer,"Look, the thing about my family is, there's five of us. Marge, Bart, girl-Bart, the one who doesn't talk, and the fat guy. How I loathe him."
Homer,"Okay, why are we in the woods? Is this heaven?"
Homer,...Which is society's fault because...
Homer,"Me. / Right here. / Oh, me too. / Please."
Homer,Cooperate?! This is one family that doesn't swing that way.
Homer,Gimme that beer!
Homer,"Okay, family huddle."
Homer,"Here's how it's gonna go down. As a family, we drive away. We cover for each other -- as a family. It's what Gabriel would have wanted."
Homer,"Okay, but talk like this."
Homer,What?
Homer,"Look, Gabriel. We're learning to work together."
Homer,"Oh, no! The roast beef is making them stronger -- and the falafel is making them angrier!"
Homer,"No! I will never... Oh wait, it's Blatz."
Homer,"Hey, they're all right."
Homer,WOLVES AND COUGARS ATE OUR ROAST BEEF!!
Homer,I knew it!
Homer,Yep. Our family is as functional as all get out.
Homer,"Oh, it's the woman I married in Vegas!"
Homer,"Give it to me, baby."
Homer,It's okay. We're married.
Homer,"Marge, I'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. Liquors drunkened me."
Homer,"Look, I did marry her, but I abandoned her. Amber, tell her how I abandoned you."
Homer,"Look, I married her, but that is as far as we went. We never, ever made whoopee -- or even mouth whoopee."
Homer,You can't kick me out. It'll cause a miscount in the census. A miscount!
Homer,"Of all the things that have ever come back to bite me in the ass, this is the worst."
Homer,"Please, just leave me alone."
Homer,"Oh, yeah... Oh, that's good... Oh, don't stop. Oh, yeah..."
Homer,"Faster... Faster... Faster... Oh, you do that like a pro..."
Homer,Use both hands...
Homer,Can't panic! Must remain calm.
Homer,"Ah, the sweet couple of seconds before I remember why I'm sleeping on the lawn."
Homer,"Marge, you're speaking to me."
Homer,Talk about what? Sports? Bigamy?
Homer,"Not a sports fan, huh?"
Homer,"You know, there are only so many times I can say I'm sorry and still mean it!"
Homer,I would if it wasn't for the kids.
Homer,"Well, that's the last we'll see of them. Come on, we're goin' to Moe's."
Homer,"My lady's glass is empty, Moe. Bring her another cookies 'n' creme martini."
Homer,"You know, she could put that mole anywhere on her face."
Homer,To Amber... who proves there are seconds in the buffet of life.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"A library selling books? If I don't want 'em for free, why would I want to pay for 'em?"
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Oh my God! Wow. Now that's a goiter.
Homer,"She said ""tavern"". I'm going to Moe's!"
Homer,"Peace, my people. All shall be looked up. Let's see, most clothespins: swallowed, inserted... here we go, clipped to face and neck. One hundred and sixteen."
Homer,"No, the best book you've ever seen is Tom Clancy's ""Op Center."""
Homer,"Ooh, here's a good one: The World's Most Overrated Saint."
Homer,I've used up all these records.
Homer,That's a great idea. Do you think I could run a mile in three and a half minutes?
Homer,"The Simpsons are goin' to Mars, so pack your... Or maybe I'll think of something else."
Homer,You're a cinch to be World's Fattest Man.
Homer,I'm here to break a world record. What's the longest anyone's ever done this?
Homer,"Fine, I'll just play the banjo with this cobra."
Homer,"Wait, wait, wait..."
Homer,But it's my banjo.
Homer,"Yeah, they're called ""Congress""."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Group stunt?
Homer,Denver?
Homer,Fellow Springfielders. I have called you all here so we can enter the Duff Book of World Records.
Homer,We're going to build the world's tallest human pyramid!
Homer,Okay. Lemme check the specs.
Homer,"Wow, my vision is coming to life!"
Homer,Mm-hm.
Homer,All right. I'll make a base camp here and try for the summit tomorrow.
Homer,Why you little!
Homer,Wait a minute.
Homer,Ha! Ha! We did it! Springfield rules!
Homer,Woo-Hoo! In your face Milwaukee!
Homer,"Now that everyone's so open about being fat, I can finally stop sucking in my gut."
Homer,"Yeah, you can't improve on nature."
Homer,Wait. You went to a sugar factory? Were there Oompa-Loompas?
Homer,"Well, well. If it isn't the woman who's too busy saving the world to save her own marriage."
Homer,It was dinner.
Homer,I was hoping we could do that together.
Homer,"Oh, I am so proud of you."
Homer,Get in the car.
Homer,"Thank you, Erin Choco-snitch. That was a group effort."
Homer,"Well, good work, Blue-hair 'n' Brocko-witch. Okay, that was mine."
Homer,Nothing left! Nothing left!
Homer,"Ooh, ooh, a sticky spot!"
Homer,Part of me knew that.
Homer,I'm with you all the way. But first...
Homer,Cool. Should I take off my shoes?
Homer,Cool.
Homer,Count Fudge-ula? I thought you wanted to get off the stuff.
Homer,"Oh, you mean Tennessee?"
Homer,I'm only doin' this one more time.
Homer,Eww. I touched it. Over.
Homer,Kinda.
Homer,"Come on! Give it! I know, I'll try reverse psychology. I don't want that stupid map."
Homer,That wasn't part of the deal!
Homer,Has everyone keistered their personal supply?
Homer,'Cause I sure haven't.
Homer,No way! We'll defy you to the death!
Homer,Remember what I told you about running away from your troubles?
Homer,Let's do it.
Homer,"Before I bring the sugar in, I want to see the Oompa-Loompa."
Homer,"That guy is freaky. Well, here's your sugar."
Homer,"Oh, they both make such good arguments."
Homer,"No Marge, I love when you do that. You're a regular Carin' A-lot-ovich."
Homer,That's what I told Lisa!
Homer,"Ah, there's nothin' better than relaxin' with my favorite magazine."
Homer,"Ooh, they're showing the filling now. Can they do that?"
Homer,What the hell is that?
Homer,Rainbows... tank tops... empowerment... This is the Gay Pride Parade! Woo hoo!
Homer,Look at those abs.
Homer,Everyone here has a six pack and I'm the only one with a keg.
Homer,"That's it, we're outta here."
Homer,"Four tickets for ""Shenani-Goats!""."
Homer,"Come on, show the movie!"
Homer,I'm laughing but it's a laugh of impatience. Show the movie!
Homer,So many previews. So many previews. So many previews.
Homer,Start the movie!
Homer,Stop the madness! Start the movie!
Homer,I'm not scared of those ushers! What are they gonna do? Advance on me?
Homer,"So long, suckers!"
Homer,My mouth. My beautiful mouth.
Homer,Broken jaw?
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Mm hmm.
Homer,I'm horny!
Homer,Nicely done.
Homer,"And when I couldn't talk, I learned to listen."
Homer,I learned so much about my family. You'd be surprised how much you hear if you just listen once in a while.
Homer,I was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.
Homer,"Sure thing, Alky."
Homer,Krackle was my favorite.
Homer,"Well, as much as humanly possible."
Homer,Ostrich burgers! Get your ostrich burgers!
Homer,"Okay, you pick one out and I'll punch it to death."
Homer,"Dude, I thought we were friends."
Homer,I'm not proud of that clip.
Homer,"Well, I don't know. The demolition derby is next month..."
Homer,"Well, okay. For you I'll be as dull as Dilbert."
Homer,I'm gonna kill you!
Homer,"Yes, and I was merely reading the title: ""I'm gonna kill you."""
Homer,Yep. Nothin' to get excited about.
Homer,"Professor Van Doren, so good to see you."
Homer,I just poured myself a new glass of milk. The old one sat out for a little while. Are you comin' to bed?
Homer,"Marge, I could stand here and argue with you, but then I'd have to get a new glass of milk. Goodnight, honey."
Homer,Marge? Marge is gone! But at least the Demolition Derby form is...
Homer,What?! Nooo!
Homer,Listen to all that revving!
Homer,"Drivers, start your engines!"
Homer,But bold moves are no longer my forte!
Homer,"Oh, what do I do? What do I do?"
Homer,"Ah, this beer's deliskous. I'm gonna saves me wife! Now let's get this show on the road."
Homer,Quit banging my wife!
Homer,Looks like I need some fuel for me mule. Gas for me ass.
Homer,"Aw, looks like a little angel. Now to save me Marge."
Homer,"That's okay, Marge, you're a good wet blanket. The kind I like wrapped around me."
Homer,"Here's to a happy, well-rested Marge!"
Homer,Unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.
Homer,What's goin' on?
Homer,"Hey Marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any off ya."
Homer,"Spill it, moneybags."
Homer,"It's like being married to my best friend, and he lets me feel his boobs."
Homer,"Hm, a million dollars? Wait a minute. How much sex would be involved? 'Cause if it's ""some""..."
Homer,"Hey Marge, I just thought of something."
Homer,"If we had Artie's money, I could get that snoring surgery. Plus at least two of those other surgeries I desperately need."
Homer,One squeaking-spring symphony coming up.
Homer,"Yeah, I..."
Homer,"Honey, did you get any sleep?"
Homer,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Homer,Uh huh.
Homer,"Okay Ziff, you get her for the weekend, but no funny stuff."
Homer,"And by funny stuff I mean handholding, goo goo eyes, misdirected woo -- which is pretty much any John Woo film--"
Homer,"This round's on me, Moe. I got a big payday comin'."
Homer,Yeah. Homer sold his wife for a million bucks.
Homer,I didn't sell her. I just rented her to an old boyfriend.
Homer,"Gee, a million bucks, that's gonna buy him a lot of, uh... Swings in the old battin' cage."
Homer,"Wait, you really think Marge is gonna fall for this guy? Even after I bought her that hockey-fight tape?"
Homer,"Oh God, you're right. I've gotta get her back before it's too late."
Homer,That's enough running.
Homer,"Oh my God, it's our high school prom! And once again I have no date!"
Homer,"Hello, Dondelinger."
Homer,Just for twenty-five years.
Homer,"Oh no. If Marge marries Artie, I'll never be born!"
Homer,"Oh guys, it was horrible. I saw Marge kissing a far superior man."
Homer,"My life here is over. Lenny, how'd you like to leave town with me, and never come back?"
Homer,Then it's settled. We leave Springfield forever.
Homer,"I saw something terrible, and I can't even say it so I'll have these two dolls do it for me."
Homer,"I'm leaving you, Marge. The next time you see my name will be in the hobo obituaries. Don't worry about the kids -- I'll drop 'em off with Patty and Selma."
Homer,Patty and Selma? Screw that!
Homer,"Just run the camera, you little..."
Homer,"Goodbye, my darling."
Homer,"Oh, it's no good. Everything reminds me of Marge."
Homer,What did Carl think?
Homer,Do you have any jobs for a man who wants to die? Something indoorsy.
Homer,"This job'll be perfect. I'm gonna leave this world the way I entered it -- dirty, screaming and torn away from the woman I love."
Homer,Another oil well successfully capped.
Homer,Oh no! This is how Faceless Joe lost his legs!
Homer,Marge?!
Homer,Why? So I can watch my wife spend the rest of her life in the arms of another man? I don't think so. Good day.
Homer,"We said ""Good day""!"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Artie, thanks for saving my life. Now, I believe there's a little matter of the million dollars..."
Homer,"Oh, I can't take his money... I can't print my own money... I have to work for money... Why don't I just lie down and die?"
Homer,"I gotta hand it to Artie Ziff, Marge. That little nerd saved my life."
Homer,"Goodnight, honey."
Homer,No. The Olympics have preempted my favorite shows for the last time!
Homer,You wait 'til next month! You wait 'til next month!
Homer,I'm bored. Heyyy... a fair!
Homer,But knowing about it would make you want to go here.
Homer,"Ten-four, princess. Is that your beer tent?"
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Monkeys cry.
Homer,Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee!
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"Hey Marge, watch me burn Flanders. Ned Flanders bids fifty dollars."
Homer,"Don't worry, honey. We can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, I promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is."
Homer,In South Carolina.
Homer,You will too!
Homer,Go gamecocks!
Homer,"Look, boy. Here's my advice on women: don't give them nicknames like ""jumbo"" or ""boxcar"" and always get receipts -- it makes you look like a business guy..."
Homer,What the hell is that?
Homer,"Wow, what kind of mileage does it get?"
Homer,"Yeah, one time, she-- Oh, she's looking at us. Be cool."
Homer,"Hello, gentlemen. Would you care to meet my new best friend..."
Homer,Rainier Wolfcastle.
Homer,"These courtside seats are great. Thanks for the hookup, Wolfie."
Homer,"That I do, sir."
Homer,DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE!
Homer,Ouch! I sat on something sharp!
Homer,I have a Boyle on my ass.
Homer,Cockfight.
Homer,Canada? Why should we leave America to visit America Junior?
Homer,"All right, Son. We'll all go -- first class!"
Homer,Doesn't matter. They have free health care.
Homer,I'm rich!
Homer,Would a U.S. dollar change your mind?
Homer,"There she is, boy."
Homer,"Listen to me, son. No one loves a quitter. So you go over there and you win her back."
Homer,"Oh, I quit. There's no convincing you. I'm gonna take a nap."
Homer,"Eh, I'm sick of this Tarzan movie."
Homer,"Oh, right."
Homer,"Really? Ooh, this I gotta see."
Homer,"Oh, he just wants to make friends."
Homer,"Ooh, who's a good dog? What a goody doggie! Oh what dee de bobo! Echee chee googie!"
Homer,He's a good doggie!
Homer,Ooh it-it ooh googie googie!
Homer,"Look Bart, sometimes dogs, or people, hate you for no reason."
Homer,Just you wait!
Homer,"Hey boy, where'd you get that hat?"
Homer,"No kidding? Hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks."
Homer,"It's just not fair. This Buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food..."
Homer,Swell.
Homer,Because I want to be your hero. On top of which I don't look bald.
Homer,One of the wheels broke off my chair today. But I didn't make a movie about it.
Homer,CAN'T KEEP IT IN...
Homer,I've seen fancier.
Homer,"Oh, listen to you. ""Ooh, ooh, I'm too old to change. "" How old are you?"
Homer,I've seen drunker.
Homer,For shame!
Homer,"Bart, I couldn't help noticing Buck is a total fraud. So I took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall."
Homer,"Well, I thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man?"
Homer,Yes!
Homer,My son lost his hero. This should be the greatest night of my life. How come I'm not happy?
Homer,Stop saying that.
Homer,Nice old man. Don't break a hip.
Homer,"Mmmm, something smells delicious."
Homer,I'm still not givin' up on Buck. There must be some hare-brained half-assed way...
Homer,Get me Buck McCoy.
Homer,Here you go. Just stop this bank robbery and you'll be a hero again. I'll wait in the car.
Homer,That hurts. But I just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?
Homer,You don't need that.
Homer,Dad!
Homer,Whoa. There's nothing wrong with a little hey-hey!
Homer,Aren't you forgettin' someone?
Homer,And don't you forget it.
Homer,"Not now, Marge. I'm waitin' for the new XFL season. Who will win this year's Million Dollar Game? Who? Who?"
Homer,"The ""X"" is for extreme!"
Homer,Who told you?!
Homer,And he never even lived to be a vegetable.
Homer,"Oh, my Dad never even knew how I felt about him."
Homer,"Sure, I said I loved him. But never that I was ""in love"" with him."
Homer,"Aw, Dad... We've got what people never get, a second chance."
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll call you. Or send you some fruit."
Homer,You sunk my Scrabbleship!
Homer,Tell that to the good men who just lost their lives.
Homer,Semper fi.
Homer,You? No way. It's too dangerous.
Homer,That was a D.W.I.
Homer,"Well, you brought me into this world, so no."
Homer,"Dad, get up."
Homer,No way.
Homer,"Oh, no. I'm not giving you my car. You'll probably drive it."
Homer,"Wow, a booth. If I'm tired, I can just lie down!"
Homer,No you can't.
Homer,"You're slow to react, Dad."
Homer,In real life he would die.
Homer,"Hey, watch the movie."
Homer,"Give me those keys. Do you have any idea what you put us through? I called the police, the hospital, my bookie, the kennel... Okay, this isn't about who I called."
Homer,Lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie.
Homer,"Straight up, Marge. That hoochie only likes you because you can drive."
Homer,Turn that down! You call that music? I-- I just don't know what to do.
Homer,"No, he's gotta learn, Marge. The way my dad made me learn."
Homer,Cosmic.
Homer,And another thing: no death races!
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Oh, that is it! Abraham J. Simpson, you are never driving again!"
Homer,Ever!
Homer,"Oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father."
Homer,We've gotta go after them.
Homer,"Uh, we'll wait for the next one."
Homer,"Here we are: Branson, Missouri!"
Homer,Only in public.
Homer,"Overdue book?! This is the biggest frame-up since O.J. Wait a minute... blood in the Bronco... the cuts on his hand... those Jay Leno monologues... Oh my God, he did it!"
Homer,"Oh yeah, I checked that out when Bart was born. I was gonna read to him every day."
Homer,Stuff kept comin' up -- mostly car-related. Piece of crap...
Homer,I decide who reads and when. How 'bout now?
Homer,"Hm, ""Homer's Odyssey."" Is this about that mini-van I rented once?"
Homer,"That mini-van had the biggest cup holders. And change slots for every coin, from penny to quarter!"
Homer,Fine.
Homer,It was the end of the Trojan War. Clever Odysseus had come up with a plan to destroy the Trojans once and for all...
Homer,Stupid King of Troy. I think I speak for all the Greeks when I say this war has gone on for too long.
Homer,"Anyway, over torture, one of your soldiers mentioned that you collect giant wooden animals. We hope you don't have a horse."
Homer,Trojans.
Homer,"If I'm laughing at what I think I am, it's very funny. Anyway... ""As night fell, the Greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse..."""
Homer,"Now, I can return to Ithaca, and my sweet wife Penelope."
Homer,Forget it. Sacrificing animals is barbaric. Now have the slaves kill the wounded.
Homer,"Gentlemen, I must be wasted, 'cause it looks like that cloud is mad at me."
Homer,"Boy, if they kiss as good as they lure... wow!"
Homer,Almost home!
Homer,"Thanks for your help with the anchor, guys. Guys?"
Homer,That pig looks like Lenny.
Homer,Mmm! That's the next best thing to eating Lenny.
Homer,I'm still hungry.
Homer,Those were my friends?!
Homer,"That's it, I'm going home. Which way to Ithaca?"
Homer,This truly is Hell!
Homer,"Honey, I'm home!"
Homer,"Oh, I'm sorry I was gone so long. But I'm gonna do something I haven't done for twenty years -- take out the trash."
Homer,"Sweet Penelope, you're just as beautiful as you were when I left."
Homer,Quit suffocating me. I'm going to Moe's.
Homer,"Oh, here's the story of Joan of Arc..."
Homer,"This one takes place in a make-believe kingdom called ""France..."""
Homer,"...The French were fighting the English, in The Hundred Years War, which was then called ""Operation Speedy Resolution."""
Homer,"Son, how's it going with the breakfast pâté?"
Homer,Victory? We're French! We don't even have a word for it.
Homer,Burn this guy! He lost our good bucket!
Homer,Wow.
Homer,"Our next story is ""Hamlet,"" by William Shakespeare."
Homer,"I don't know, but that would be hot. ""Once upon a time there was a young prince of Denmark."""
Homer,It's cold outside. You'll need a sweater. A sweater!
Homer,"Son, it's not only a great play, but also became a great movie. Called ""Ghostbusters."""
Homer,Now that's what I call a moon shot.
Homer,I'm pretty sure it wasn't.
Homer,"Boy, did you make a prank call to Brazil?"
Homer,Choke on your lies!
Homer,Which phone company? There are hundreds of them. And they all keep changing their names.
Homer,We are not paying this bill.
Homer,"Fine, I'll cut off your ponytail."
Homer,"Marge, it's called negotiating."
Homer,"Ooo, fascinating."
Homer,"I told you, I have too much time on my hands."
Homer,Why didn't you call me?
Homer,That's it. They have awoken a sleeping giant.
Homer,Get me tools and beer.
Homer,"Free service, here we come."
Homer,"All right, let's try the red one."
Homer,"Okay, I'll try the green."
Homer,Let's try the red one again.
Homer,Not again! Ow! Let's try 'em together.
Homer,Maybe the red one...
Homer,How did I get here?
Homer,The one I didn't make and Marge didn't make and Bart didn't make and hence no one in the house made.
Homer,"Yeah, the one we both like."
Homer,Don't you know the boys from Brazil are little Hitlers? I saw it in a movie. Whose name I can't remember.
Homer,No way. I still haven't lost the weight I put on from the last one.
Homer,I said forget it!
Homer,"Oh, that poor little boy. We've got to find him."
Homer,How many people live in Brazil?
Homer,Then it's settled. The Simpsons are going to Brazil.
Homer,"The Simpsons are going to Antarctica. Next year. This year, Brazil."
Homer,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So in August... it's cold?"
Homer,And in February... it's hot?
Homer,"So it's opposite land. Crooks chase cops, cats have puppies..."
Homer,So hot snow falls up?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Forget every word, boy. It's useless."
Homer,Wow. It's like He's on the dashboard of the entire country.
Homer,"Way ahead of you, Marge."
Homer,TAKE ME TO THE HOTEL / MY HANDS ARE ON A GUY'S ASS / BOY THIS DUDE MUST WORK OUT...
Homer,"Look Marge, I'm Brazilian."
Homer,"I got it, I got, I got it."
Homer,"Hey, and a mini-bar hat."
Homer,...I WILL EAT THIS TOBLERONE / AND I WILL NOT PAY!
Homer,"There he is! It-- Oh wait, you said brown hair, right?"
Homer,"Ooh, they look like Skittles."
Homer,"Now Lisa, it's not as bleak as that. Can you fly me over town to look for him?"
Homer,"Oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh?"
Homer,"But you're on vacation, honey. I'm not wearing my wedding ring!"
Homer,"We'll do our best, honey. Now let's get goin'."
Homer,Check please.
Homer,Does that include tip?
Homer,How did you know?!
Homer,"Mine keeps disappearing. Oh, well."
Homer,I hope they're goin' somewhere good.
Homer,"Okay boy, let's strut our stuff. I GO TO RIO"") I'M IN RIO / AND I'M WALKING ON THE BEACH / I'M IN MY SPEEDO..."
Homer,Gimme a drink with all your sweetest Brazilian fruits mixed together.
Homer,Sweet. Sweet! SWEET!
Homer,Ahhh...
Homer,"Hey, Bart. How many more places do we have to search?"
Homer,Taxi!
Homer,So that means I don't have to pay the fare.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Fine. Take me, but let the boy go."
Homer,"Eh, same old garbage!"
Homer,This corn doesn't look so big.
Homer,What?!
Homer,I'll regroup at Red Lobster!
Homer,You ain't pretty no more!
Homer,"Aw, look. I've made some friends. And now, go do my bidding... whatever it may be!"
Homer,"So Lisa says by killing their enemy, I became the alpha-crow."
Homer,"I'm sure he'll turn up. Look, here's one of his buttons."
Homer,"There's Russell Crow, Cameron Crow, Crow Diddly, Hume Crow-nyn, Gregory Peck..."
Homer,"It's a murder, honey. A group of crows is called a murder."
Homer,"Drop it in, don't cram it in. Oh, forget it, I'll do it myself."
Homer,"Awww, look, Maggie wants to fly too."
Homer,"Hey, cut it out! Put her down!"
Homer,"Oh, thank God you're okay."
Homer,"Okay, that was not cool. We need to lay down some ground rules--"
Homer,"We'll get to that. Right now, I think we need some time apart--"
Homer,"All right, that's it. Shoo, you stupid crows! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!"
Homer,That is not a worm.
Homer,Ow! Ow!
Homer,I hate getting stitches in my eyes. Stupid crows.
Homer,"Hm, fascinating. Say doctor, can you do something about my searing pain?"
Homer,Does it go in the butt?
Homer,"Look, man. I don't do drugs."
Homer,I had a bad experience with drugs...
Homer,"For me, the sixties ended that day in nineteen seventy-eight."
Homer,"But isn't marijuana, or ""dope,"" illegal?"
Homer,"Okay, let's see: ""Toke as needed. Caution: objects may appear more edible than they actually are."""
Homer,SMOKE ON THE WATER / DOO DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO
Homer,"THEY BURNED DOWN THE GAMBLING HOUSE - IT DIED WITH AN AWFUL SOUND / I AM HUNGRY FOR A CAN-DY BAR / I THINK I'LL EAT A ""MOUNDS""..."
Homer,"Marge, it's making my eyes better, and it's legal."
Homer,I could walk up to the President and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.
Homer,"Marge, I just realized: I am the ""ow"" in the word ""now"". And if you tell anyone..."
Homer,"Hey, it's me. I got Marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out."
Homer,I didn't. But now Daddy's special medicine...
Homer,"Which you must never use because it will ruin your life, lets Daddy see and hear magical things you will never experience. Ever."
Homer,Sh-sh-sh.
Homer,"Oh my God, this dude does the best Flanders! You got the mustache and the didilly... Okay, now do Wiggum."
Homer,"Oh-ho-ho-ho right, the God dude. Hey, I got a question for you."
Homer,"""Could Jesus microwave a burrito so hot, that He Himself could not eat it?"""
Homer,Now you know what I've been goin' through.
Homer,"Oh man, this is long. Could you read it to me?"
Homer,Wow. Wow. God does so much for me. And he doesn't ask anything in return.
Homer,"Done and done. Now, do Wiggum."
Homer,I said Wiggum!
Homer,"Oops! I thought this was the can, man."
Homer,You just said it!
Homer,You're covered with a very fine fuzz.
Homer,Hardly working...
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, one question at a time. Yes, you?"
Homer,"Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for you. I just got promoted and it's all thanks to ""Yes-I-cannabis."""
Homer,We have a kitchen?!
Homer,Look at Shemp! He is so high!
Homer,"And ""Otto"" is ""Otto"" backwards."
Homer,"As soon as I graduate, I am so outta here."
Homer,"We gotta get out and stop that initiative. Marge, I'm gonna need ten thousand veggie burritos."
Homer,"Good afternoon. I want to thank you all for coming down here, taking time off from your jobs..."
Homer,'Cause we need to keep medical marijuana legal!
Homer,"Whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented ""The Matrix,"" medical marijuana can make things fabulous. Medically."
Homer,"So my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on Tuesday the seventh..."
Homer,"Oh man, they already voted. And we lost!"
Homer,"Oh, man, I can't believe we spaced on the date."
Homer,"Well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands."
Homer,"Although, wow!"
Homer,"Oh, I could have smoked that pot. And worn that hair."
Homer,Eyes? What the hell are you talkin' about?
Homer,All right. I'll do it for my kids.
Homer,Never!
Homer,Get out.
Homer,"Oh, yeah. Get out."
Homer,Going cold turkey isn't as delicious as it sounds.
Homer,"It's been three days. And my mind is clearer, my sperm count is up, and I'm able to recognize simple shapes and patterns."
Homer,"Unregardless, I will no longer be a slave to this."
Homer,"As a reminder, Marge."
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,But I can't find you funny anymore.
Homer,This stuff can make anything funny... even the show that follows Friends. But I promised my family I wouldn't smoke it anymore.
Homer,"Start inhalin', Waylon."
Homer,You mean that guy on 60 Minutes who yells all the time?
Homer,"Oh, man. Oh, man. We killed Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns is gonna be so mad."
Homer,So what? Mr. Burns is dead.
Homer,"Bill Clinton, everyone! He's Jimmy Carter with a Fox attitude."
Homer,And now a man you will see is definitely not dead... Mr. Montgomery Burns!
Homer,"Mr. Burns, as we're running long, may we skip your speech and go directly to the questions?"
Homer,"Mr. Burns, may I field that one?"
Homer,It's true we're losing money...
Homer,"But there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away."
Homer,Mr. Burns has left the building!
Homer,And you wanted to take him to the hospital.
Homer,Want a chocolate?
Homer,Waiting for my wife. She has a surprise for me.
Homer,"Did you say ""life story""?"
Homer,"Things started out great. I ate what my mother ate. And my mother loved chili. Then, suddenly:"
Homer,Don't you have criminals to catch?
Homer,My father and I were never really close.
Homer,I never found true happiness until I met Marge.
Homer,And life just gets more exciting.
Homer,Then came the day that changes every couple forever. The day we got our elephant.
Homer,"While I wait for my family, I'll tell you about the time my baby shot my boss."
Homer,"Ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together..."
Homer,"All my other senses are getting sharper. Bart, you had pizza for lunch. Lisa, you're extremely depressed."
Homer,Kathleen Turner!
Homer,Are the proceeds going to charity?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,That was at my expense. What kind of a roast is this?
Homer,I'm sick of your lies. Secrets and lies. It's always secrets and lies.
Homer,Secrets and lies...
Homer,You name it.
Homer,Stupid lawn chair!
Homer,Come on... unfold you...
Homer,Ow!
Homer,"This'll teach that stupid chair. I'm on fire! Oh, I hope no one's drawing this. Ow!"
Homer,"Always drawing your old man, huh? You must think I'm the greatest dad in the world."
Homer,Lousy minor setback! This world sucks!
Homer,I hate them so much!
Homer,"Oh, I've been there, man."
Homer,My ice cream sandwich! Then where the hell's the remote?!
Homer,Why do people keep moving it... stupid...
Homer,That guy's hilarious. I especially like his white shirt and blue pants. Wait a second... Angry Dad is me!
Homer,What kind of a monster would humiliate me like this?
Homer,Why that little...
Homer,"Stupid ""Bart-toon""! Bart-toon, that's clever. I'm gonna kill him!"
Homer,"Stop it! The more you rock, the angrier I get!"
Homer,Leave me alone!
Homer,"Uh, uh... we're just rehearsing for ""Angry Dad: The Motion Picture""."
Homer,That's just so obvious!
Homer,It should be Gary Oldman!
Homer,I'm just passionate -- like all us Greeks.
Homer,"Oh, I am..."
Homer,"Oh my gosh, you're right. I'm a rage-aholic. I just can't live without rage-ahol!"
Homer,Is it also the last step?
Homer,Very well. I'm not gonna be Angry Dad for one day longer. I'm giving up anger forever!
Homer,I said anger.
Homer,"I gave up anger forever. From now on, I'm into candles, soft music and horse tranquilizers."
Homer,"Ah, nothing can make me mad out here."
Homer,Must suppress rage.
Homer,"Hello there, Flan-didly-danders."
Homer,THEY CALL ME MELLOW YELLOW... QUITE RIGHTLY! THIS FELLOW NEVER BELLOWS... QUITE RIGHTLY!
Homer,This looks suspicious... but delicious!
Homer,Cacti!
Homer,Dirty diapers on strings!
Homer,Time to put this ordeal behind me.
Homer,Homer mad!
Homer,Homer mad! Homer smash! Get revenge on world!
Homer,"Well son, I wanna show you how grateful I am. Let's go fishing."
Homer,Who knew that anger was savin' my life?
Homer,"You're trying to get me angry, thank you."
Homer,"I love you, boy."
Homer,Stop it now.
Homer,"I need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till I tap the keg."
Homer,Thanks. Are you sure you don't want to come? In a Civil War reenactment we need lots of Indians to shoot.
Homer,Hi-Yo!
Homer,"Oh my God! I know you must get this all the time, but can I suggest a flavor?"
Homer,Grape.
Homer,She likes you! Put in a good word for grape.
Homer,"Okay, okay, don't go Mary Todd on us."
Homer,"C'mon Barney, if you're gonna be General Grant, you have to have a drink."
Homer,One drink won't hurt.
Homer,Mm-hmm!
Homer,This was supposed to be a mock battle! Mock!
Homer,Don't worry. I'm just gonna drain the area around your wound. So cold... so cold...
Homer,"Now, you just take the kids home. I've got to return this keg."
Homer,Why do you always take the side of local merchants?
Homer,"Now Apu, when you gave me this keg it had dents. And here's proof."
Homer,Apu?
Homer,That giggle is none of my business. Or is it?
Homer,What's a eunuch?
Homer,"""Unique, unite..."""
Homer,"Nothing, nothing. There's nothing eating me up inside."
Homer,Let's go.
Homer,"I know, can you believe it? Oh, Manjula's just gonna die!"
Homer,"In my role as customer, I saw the whole thing."
Homer,"Dirty love. I mean, thirty love. I mean, anyone for penis? I'll just get the shuttlecock."
Homer,"Here, guys."
Homer,Why don't you play this?
Homer,"Marge, why are you crying? You're not in any physical pain. The only kind of pain a man can understand."
Homer,He already knows. Let's tell Krusty.
Homer,That guy's hilarious. His reaction would be priceless.
Homer,Apu is cheating!
Homer,I think he's building to something.
Homer,"...So anyway, if you take that bottle down, and pass it around--"
Homer,"Okay, this isn't easy, so I'm just gonna come out and say it."
Homer,"Let's say this pepper got married to this salt shaker, and along comes sexy Mrs. Dash..."
Homer,I saw you and that Squishee Lady -- canoodling like junkyard rabbits!
Homer,Yes. You are scum.
Homer,"Mmm, caramel baloney."
Homer,You might hear from your friends or co-workers that Apu isn't living at home anymore.
Homer,You bet I am!
Homer,U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
Homer,And Krusty. We gotta invite Krusty.
Homer,Yeah! 'Cause if they don't...
Homer,This is going great.
Homer,"Uh, we didn't order that."
Homer,Can I lick your fingers? Meet me at the mail slot.
Homer,It's where I got this!
Homer,"Hey, Apu, I think she likes you."
Homer,Whee! Whee!
Homer,It's been on my list for a long time.
Homer,I bought the issue for Richard Avedon's pictures of Lenny.
Homer,Woo!
Homer,It was magic. He took a Cockney flower girl and turned her into my fair lady.
Homer,"Wait, wait. You forgot to eat a light bulb."
Homer,Here you go. Don't worry. I soaked it in the toilet to soften it up.
Homer,"Well, hookers and Spiderman."
Homer,"Are you okay, Lisa?"
Homer,"Aww, she must have dreamt about Hitler again."
Homer,...I GET KNOCKED DOWN / I GET KNOCKED DOWN AGAIN / YOU'RE NEVER GONNA KNOCK ME DOWN!
Homer,"Hey, where's my keg?"
Homer,I TAKE A WHISKEY DRINK / I TAKE A CHOCOLATE DRINK / AND WHEN I HAVE TO PEE / I USE THE KITCHEN SINK / I SING THE SONG THAT REMINDS ME I'M A URINATING GUY!
Homer,FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX!
Homer,"That's it, boy! It's time for your bath!"
Homer,Now go to bed!
Homer,That is called parenting. I'm going to Moe's.
Homer,"Good night, Bart."
Homer,"Good night, Lisa."
Homer,"Good night, Maggie."
Homer,"Cherish these moments, Homer."
Homer,What the-- You earned how many credits without our permission?
Homer,Against my wishes!
Homer,"Oh sure, when a man does it, it's smutty. But if a woman did it--"
Homer,"Oh, come on--"
Homer,You're right.
Homer,"I was trying to throw Bart over the roof, and he got stuck in this tree."
Homer,"Marge, where's my pellet gun?"
Homer,Right.
Homer,"Oh no, not the good cheek!"
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Guys, I just ordered my wife the greatest anniversary present -- a koi pond."
Homer,"Certainly, Lenford. Make every day a celebration of your love. Surprise her with a pasta salad! Put a mini-beret on your wang!"
Homer,"Hey, hey, hey, no peeking."
Homer,"Happy anniversary, Marge!"
Homer,What the hell is that noise?
Homer,"Aw, the poor thing's in pain. What he needs is a visit from kindly old Dr. Foot."
Homer,"Fine, I won't kill it."
Homer,Finish the job.
Homer,Are you sure God doesn't want it to be dead?
Homer,"If he wants to sleep with us, forget it."
Homer,Once upon a time there were three bears. The end.
Homer,"Oh fine, I'll go back to the beginning."
Homer,"Oh no, I crushed that horrible bug. What should I do?"
Homer,"Uh, he's sleeping."
Homer,"Well, uh, the thing about that is, uh..."
Homer,Woo hoo! He's alive. Now you can't punish me.
Homer,Lousy Community Service. Meals on wheels! Eat it up or I go to jail!
Homer,"Uh, they discontinued the cobbler."
Homer,Now let's not get into who smells like what.
Homer,Safe and sound.
Homer,That's better.
Homer,"Thank God. I'm out of matches. Oh no, here's another one."
Homer,Please don't kill me! I won't tell anyone about the skeleton. And I could bring you more victims. Like Lenny! He'd go great with wild rice.
Homer,But what about the axe?
Homer,"Eh, you're the shut-in."
Homer,"...so I threw the super ball so hard it hit the ceiling twice, then broke a lamp."
Homer,"Yeah, I've gotten a lot of compliments about my talking."
Homer,My pleasure.
Homer,And I can ride my bike real fast.
Homer,"Hey, I'm not running an employment service, you old ba-- Oh-ho-ho, you mean me? I'd be delighted."
Homer,"Y'ello! Hi, Mrs. Bellamy. No, I'm not doing anything. I can mow your lawn."
Homer,Cover for me.
Homer,"Hello?... Uh-huh. Yes Mrs. Bellamy, I'll be right there."
Homer,"Marge, I can't say no to a helpless old lady. They put spells on you!"
Homer,Laxative?
Homer,The Missus prefers you call me Simpson.
Homer,Are you all right?
Homer,Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine. I--
Homer,O-kay.
Homer,Buh... guh... muh... wuh. Zuh.
Homer,Without a trace.
Homer,"Oh-ho, so it's a good thing she died. From our point of view. Financially."
Homer,"Now if you'll excuse us, we'll just be... DOES THAT EVER WORK?"
Homer,"Book 'im, Lou."
Homer,You'd be dead a million times.
Homer,"Oh man, what a day. I'd kill for a beer."
Homer,I'd stab somebody for a pickle.
Homer,Gimme some peanuts.
Homer,I'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.
Homer,What? It goes right by our house.
Homer,Here's my underwear drawer.
Homer,Mrs. Bellamy's necklace!
Homer,"You know Chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you."
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. I'll cut us a deal by becoming a jailhouse snitch. I know who stopped up the toilet!"
Homer,Can't you do anything? Surprise witnesses? Evidence tampering? Play the race card. Play it.
Homer,Let's just say I'm planning a little surprise for the execution. This cannon is going to be full when I go off. Ka-boom!
Homer,"Y'know, this is our last night... and our cells are side-by-side..."
Homer,Just think of them as twinkling stars.
Homer,I want to confess. I killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. Marge is completely innocent. The only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder I did.
Homer,Now you do it for me.
Homer,"Goodbye, Marge."
Homer,What?!
Homer,I knew it!
Homer,"This whole thing was a joke? Oh, I've never been so relieved! Relieved and angry."
Homer,"Well, I'm glad everyone's all right, but I think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for TV ratings."
Homer,I've made my choice.
Homer,"So hot, so sticky..."
Homer,Marge?!
Homer,You know what will cool this place down? A little touch of winter.
Homer,"Lisa, if we start conserving, the environmentalists win!"
Homer,Jingle bell what?
Homer,A blackout?! Every time Santa and I get together it's a disaster.
Homer,"Oh, no! They're stealing the tire fire!"
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,No! I've caused enough trouble already by plugging in that Santa Claus. No more irresponsible behavior.
Homer,"All right, but not the imported."
Homer,"You've got to set limits, Marge."
Homer,Yeah. Wiggum couldn't catch cooties at Milhouse's birthday party.
Homer,"Oh. Seriously, everyone says your parties rock."
Homer,"I admit it. I did screw up, but I won't feel guilty until I can put a human face on this."
Homer,Wrong answer.
Homer,"Marge, doesn't Lisa have a human face?"
Homer,That's it. Nobody messes with my little girl. I'm gonna find those dolls.
Homer,"See, when you don't use Milhouse, it's hard. I love this kid."
Homer,"Interesting. All right, I've come up with a composite sketch of my prime suspect."
Homer,Exactly.
Homer,"Look at him over there, eating that apple. What's he planning? What?!"
Homer,You're right. What's this?
Homer,A cap!
Homer,"From ""The Woolly Bully."""
Homer,Do you sell hats?
Homer,To people?
Homer,People with heads?
Homer,Did you steal dolls from my daughter?
Homer,"Well think again. Son, you're going to juvie."
Homer,"Good, 'cause I need directions."
Homer,Aw...
Homer,"Hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. And I felt like a big man pushing that kid around."
Homer,Cheese!
Homer,"Oh, well... Heh, heh. Hm... oh, I'll... no...."
Homer,"You know, I've had a lot of jobs: boxer, mascot, astronaut, imitation Krusty, baby proofer, trucker, hippy, plow driver, food critic, conceptual artist, grease salesman, carny, Mayor, grifter, bodyguard for the Mayor, country western manager, garbage commissioner, mountain climber, farmer, inventor, Smithers, Poochie, celebrity assistant, power plant worker, fortune cookie writer, beer baron, Kwik-E-Mart clerk, homophobe, and missionary. But protecting Springfield, that gives me the best feeling of all."
Homer,"Finally, a way to combine my love of helping people with my love of hurting people."
Homer,"Fellas, I'm starting my own private police force. Will you join me?"
Homer,How 'bout Lenny?
Homer,You'll do as I say or I'll have your badges. Once I make and give you your badges.
Homer,"Flanders, I was able to find your missing leaf blower, belt sander and morning newspapers."
Homer,Who said it was a he?
Homer,Who said you did?
Homer,"You're pushing your luck, pal."
Homer,"Ooh, ooh! Here's my commercial!"
Homer,"Is this you? If it is, don't dial nine one one. Simply dial six three six five five five three four seven two."
Homer,"Have no fear, SpringShield's present!"
Homer,The only friend you need is SpringShield.
Homer,"You know, the old lady's apartment was actually Lenny's. We just used a different duvet cover."
Homer,Green vegetables and homework.
Homer,Even dessert?
Homer,Woo hoo! I'm Chief of Police.
Homer,"Now that I am the law, I'm gonna make a lot of changes around here. First, I'm gonna cut overhead by freeing Otis, the lovable town drunk."
Homer,What a character.
Homer,"Well, according to this, he's tellin' the truth."
Homer,"All right, Fat Tony. Your little game is over."
Homer,"If that thug thinks he can run me out of town... oh man, I love this song."
Homer,"I'VE BEEN DRIVING ALL NIGHT, HAND'S WET ON THE WHEEL... THERE'S A VOICE IN MY HEAD THAT DRIVES MY HEEL... IT'S MY BABY CALLIN' ON THE TELEPHONE... I GOT SOME PIZZA AND I'M BRINGIN' IT HOME..."
Homer,"You all know me. I've kept the streets safe for you and your children. I've tricked or treated at many of your houses. Last year I was Jar Jar Binks. Now, who will stand and fight with me?"
Homer,"Shut up, Flanders. Anyone else? What about you, Dr. Hibbert?"
Homer,After everything I did you're going to abandon me?
Homer,"What, and let them come after you and the kids?"
Homer,In one car? With no air conditioning? And the little poop machine going every twenty minutes?
Homer,I need you guys to help me. Why'd you lock yourselves in?
Homer,"I don't get it. I finally did a job where I wasn't lazy, stupid, or corrupt -- and now I'm gonna get killed for it."
Homer,"Yeah, you can kill me, but someone'll take my place. And if you kill him, someone'll take his place. And that's pretty much the end of it. The town'll be yours."
Homer,"Yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me. I'm giving this badge to the next guy I see."
Homer,I must have a guardian angel -- with a rifle.
Homer,"Aw, she's taking a nap."
Homer,"She's just like Clark Kent. When there's lots of excitement, she's nowhere to be found. Nighty-night, sweetie."
Homer,Now to spend some quality time away from my family.
Homer,"Oh, I'd love to, but someone made me too many pancakes and now I have to sleep them off."
Homer,Were they now?
Homer,The hammock man! I'm glad he's a little early today.
Homer,You had me at comfort.
Homer,"Mr. Hammock, say hello to Madam Ass."
Homer,What the...? It made another me! How cool is that?
Homer,"Hm, no belly-button."
Homer,Shuttle's in the hangar!
Homer,You wanna be my slave?
Homer,Outstanding.
Homer,"Speed it up, ugly."
Homer,"Eh, he had a good run."
Homer,I'm gonna need help with this.
Homer,Hm...
Homer,"No, you've got chores to do."
Homer,Clone?! That's ridiculous. Where am I supposed to find a... wait a minute.
Homer,"Wow, four of me. I think this could be a magic hammock. And it just might be the answer to my problems."
Homer,"I'll take it from here, Fake-o."
Homer,Uh-huh!
Homer,"Man, are we evenly matched."
Homer,"I mean, four!"
Homer,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!"
Homer,"Yeah, but you'll have to leave a credit card."
Homer,Ned...
Homer,"Twenty-three. Now, today I'm gonna mow the lawn, do my taxes, shoot hoops with Bart and girl it up with Lisa."
Homer,"Ohh, I gotta get rid of these guys."
Homer,"Now before I abandon you in this cornfield, does anyone remember the way home?"
Homer,Anybody else?
Homer,Anybody else? Come on...
Homer,"Okay, everyone out!"
Homer,Now to make sure this hammock never troubles anyone again.
Homer,"You'd think so, but no."
Homer,"Yeah, it's a good group."
Homer,Noooo!
Homer,We're out of donuts!
Homer,Good news.
Homer,Not Mr. Blasty?
Homer,"It's okay, boy. You'll be shooting angels in heaven."
Homer,"Marge, let me do a solo. This could be my big break."
Homer,"Hey, so are the Grammy judges. --"
Homer,Gimme!
Homer,"Hear me, people of the past!"
Homer,I come to deliver a terrifying message of hope. Grab your guns and follow me!
Homer,"Oh, how to explain this to a child... Hm... Future Daddy needs to double-kill these corpses so they won't come back as zombies, and-- Get 'im!"
Homer,"Hey, what could be more fun than an island shaped like a big smiley face?"
Homer,"Hey, I've been around Scotsmen."
Homer,"Hey, I'm on vacation."
Homer,"You mean, they're gonna try to sell us time shares?"
Homer,Bring back some ice.
Homer,"What's up, honey? Want a little lovin'?"
Homer,Isn't vacation sex always the best?
Homer,"Marge, you were like a wild beast. So voracious and prowly."
Homer,And I've never seen you use your tail like that.
Homer,"Oh my God! She's become a monster! Which I have to admit, I sort of suspected during the sex."
Homer,Gotta find a way to change Marge back. And replace the M&Ms I took from the mini bar.
Homer,Flanders?! A perfect vacation ruined.
Homer,"Uh, I really don't wanna do that, Ned."
Homer,Fine.
Homer,"You know, you're not helping."
Homer,"IN THE JUNGLE, THE CREEPY JUNGLE / HOMER RIDES A FREAK..."
Homer,What's that?
Homer,I can't believe it. Hibbert's turned you all into human guinea pigs!
Homer,Eat... my... shorts?! Why you little...
Homer,Maggie!
Homer,Lisa!
Homer,What game?
Homer,"Manimals, invertebroads! You must fight back against the one who did this to you!"
Homer,Wait'll Moe sees how wasted I got without him. He's gonna plotz.
Homer,You guys are nuts. All you can do is eat and sleep and mate and roll around in your own filth and mate and eat... where do I sign up?
Homer,"Hi, Moe, got any beer?"
Homer,What the-- Where's my money?
Homer,So you're just gonna let me walk out of here sober.
Homer,And you can live with that.
Homer,Fine. There are plenty of other ways for me to alter my consciousness.
Homer,"Oh, yeah."
Homer,Lick 'em. Go away.
Homer,"Jewish? Oh, no, I'm not Jewish."
Homer,"Well, Moe..."
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Ah, I don't care about the color of your skin, Lenny. You're my friend!"
Homer,"Oh, you'd like that wouldn't you, ya..."
Homer,I've had just about enough of you.
Homer,I'm outta here...
Homer,"Hey, you want my keys?"
Homer,"Get 'em now, jerks."
Homer,"So long, jerks."
Homer,"Running after the car, huh? Let's see if you can follow this."
Homer,Moe's Tavern.
Homer,"Good morning, everybody! What's for breakfast, cutie?"
Homer,"What? Wait a... That can't be right! Wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?"
Homer,"If I was that drunk, I would remember it."
Homer,Couldn't you come up with a less embarrassing lie?
Homer,"Of course. It was, uh... some kind of a... light rail."
Homer,"Oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?"
Homer,And that's why you're my favorite.
Homer,"All right, time for my favorite show."
Homer,I don't remember anybody telling me I was gonna be on TV.
Homer,"Yeah, I'm pretty great..."
Homer,That my family isn't the center of my universe? Are you nuts?
Homer,"Oh, I can't believe they took ""Monkey Trauma Center"" off for this."
Homer,Lousy family...
Homer,A hot babe...
Homer,"Oh, I don't resent you, sweetheart. What I was trying to say, and maybe I didn't use the right words, was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail, but as coffins go..."
Homer,"Oh, what have I done?"
Homer,"Hey, what's this suitcase for? Are we going on a trip?"
Homer,Where are you taking me?
Homer,You can't just leave me out here! There's not another woman for miles!
Homer,"""The Rolling Stones Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp!!"" But I thought you guys were mad at me. For once in my life, I'm confused."
Homer,Damn straight.
Homer,You what?
Homer,"You guys are the best. I love you, I love you, I love you..."
Homer,"I'm okay. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you..."
Homer,"Hey, what gives? Where are all the rock stars?"
Homer,What was that?
Homer,Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! It's Mick Jagger and Keith Richards...
Homer,Woo! STD's!
Homer,To rock!
Homer,Are you ready...to receive professional training in rock?!
Homer,I am so excited I couldn't fall asleep! I even took some pills I found on the floor and still nothing!
Homer,"Uh-huh. Now I'm afraid that if I stop talking, I'll die. Isn't Mick cool? I thought he'd be all like, ""I'm a rock star. Aren't I great?"" But he's just like you or me or Jesus over there."
Homer,"Out of my way, Nerdlinger."
Homer,Here you go.
Homer,"Ooh, I'm telling Mr. Jagger."
Homer,"Like this, Mr. Kravitz?"
Homer,Mr. Seltzer?
Homer,"No, I think it's Seltzer."
Homer,I came up with a stage move I feel is very cool.
Homer,"Baby, baby, baby, baby!"
Homer,Sorry Mick!
Homer,"I'M SO HOT FOR ME, I'M SO HOT FOR ME / I'M SO COLD..."
Homer,Bor-ing.
Homer,But rock stars are supposed to be about drinking and getting drunk and boozing it up.
Homer,Precisely.
Homer,I got 'em!
Homer,I'm entitled to a private life! I'm not a role model! And so forth.
Homer,We know!
Homer,"Well, whaddaya think?"
Homer,Really? You really think I'm better than you?
Homer,What the hell are you doing here?
Homer,It's been a week already?
Homer,"Wait, don't go! I wanna keep on rockin'. C'mon guys... a-one, a-two..."
Homer,Noooo!!
Homer,"No! No, I won't go! You can't make me!"
Homer,I knew nothing!
Homer,Never!
Homer,"My dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. I was so close to being a rock star, but now there's a chance it might not happen. I'll just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing."
Homer,I'm so despondent.
Homer,But I like it...
Homer,For serious?
Homer,Can I have forty guest passes?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Wow, All-Access. All-Access..."
Homer,Good thing it's laminated.
Homer,All-access.
Homer,All-Access.
Homer,"And after the show, you can come backstage for pizza and pop."
Homer,Here you go. Front and center.
Homer,"Oops, gotta run. Enjoy the show."
Homer,"Evening, fellow rockers."
Homer,I'm ready. Just give me a guitar. How many solos should I do? Four?
Homer,I'll do four.
Homer,My official tour jacket!
Homer,"Look at-- Wait, they misspelled ""Guitar Hero."""
Homer,Can't you do it?
Homer,"Oh. Okay. So I'll, uh... okay."
Homer,"Test, test..."
Homer,"Test, test. Check, check."
Homer,"Test... ""TEST TEST, YOU'RE TESTIN' MY LOVE FOR YOU, CHECK CHECK, YOU'RE CHECKIN' TO SEE IF I'M TRUE..."""
Homer,TEST ONE-TEST TWO-TEST THREE-TEST FOUR YOU TEST ME LIKE THE WATER IN EL SALVADOR...
Homer,"BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY... Uh-oh."
Homer,"Oh, yeah... When you've been in as many as I have, you can sense them coming."
Homer,"What am I, the lost and found?"
Homer,"There's no need for apologies, guys. You're rock stars! You're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail."
Homer,"Well, you're very sweet, Mick, but the only rocking I want to do is in my living room chair, surrounded by the world's greatest back-up group, my family."
Homer,"Nah, I've got something to remember 'em by."
Homer,"Have fun at school, kids."
Homer,Rock and Roll! Woo hoo!
Homer,I hate reality shows...
Homer,"I've grown, you haven't."
Homer,"I can't take any more of these shows. If I wanted reality, I'd finally have this lump looked at."
Homer,"Stupid writers and actors, priced yourselves right out of the business. Nice going, geniuses."
Homer,"Marge, we can't pinch pennies on the machine that's going to be raising our children."
Homer,"Come on, kids. Daddy knows a way to get the money... with no risk."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,No problem.
Homer,"Hey, Flanders -- check out my new satellite dish!"
Homer,I bet you would.
Homer,Damn your sparkling wordplay!
Homer,"Oh, it's red wire to red wire. What idiot dreamed that up?"
Homer,Mmm... feed...
Homer,"Kids, kids, you're both right."
Homer,Put pie here.
Homer,Me not pig.
Homer,Homicidal robots... so like us.
Homer,They're gonna be in the same class as each other?
Homer,An old army buddy is visiting Mannix?
Homer,The status quo.
Homer,"Hey, you can't fool us. We're from the ""Learn to Fart"" state."
Homer,"Well, what about Bart?"
Homer,This is where the kids were last seen.
Homer,"Well, he's not gonna get very far without that."
Homer,"Bart, is that you?"
Homer,"And Maggie, you no longer have to live with the burden of replacing Bart and Lisa."
Homer,Dew-ey! Dew-ey! Dew-ey!
Homer,Woo hoo! I win the bet! Who's your Daddy?
Homer,Not if I can stop that inauguration!
Homer,Let's hear it.
Homer,"You know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself."
Homer,Domiciles for the Destitute? Is this that thing that Jimmy Carter does?
Homer,"Well, if Bart can be ""El Barto""..."
Homer,"Oh, thanks..."
Homer,"Huh? Oh, right. Can you hold it?"
Homer,My real ring's inside a turtle.
Homer,Can I help you?
Homer,... And that's how my beautiful wife brought our son Bart into the world.
Homer,"Sure, why not?"
Homer,"Hey, why would I want Purina when I've got Fancy Feast right here?"
Homer,"Aw, it sounds like all you're looking for is a little reassurance. Well..."
Homer,Did you label the meals so I can tell which is which?
Homer,"Well, someone's tucked in to an insane degree. Goodnight!"
Homer,"Hey, gimme some of those blankets."
Homer,"What's this? It's enormous! Oh my God, there's another one!"
Homer,Explain later!
Homer,I fell off. Hee hee hee.
Homer,"Yeah, he truly is a monster. Hey, let's go out to dinner tomorrow. Just you, me, the kids and the twins. Whadaya say?"
Homer,"Well, that cinches it. Lisa gets the prize for the best off-the-cuff response."
Homer,"That's not true, Lisa, there are a lot of complicated issues here, that can only be explained through song."
Homer,"YOU TOOK A TWENTY-KARAT DIAMOND, AND MADE IT GLEAM / LIKE A BIG SPAGHETTI DINNER, SMOTHERED IN WHIPPED CREAM."
Homer,AND THEY'RE ALL MINE...
Homer,Uh... I was gettin' around to it.
Homer,Forget it Kiki. You're not putting your brain into her body.
Homer,No dice. Take your fun and adventure outside.
Homer,Wait for what? Confirmation of my attitude?
Homer,"Shut up, boy."
Homer,"With the economy the way it is, you're lucky you get soup."
Homer,"Gentlemen, say hello to Springfield's newest supermodel!"
Homer,I'm on it.
Homer,Do you have anything with ground-up whale in it?
Homer,"I came out the elephant's mouth, right? 'Cause I already showered once today."
Homer,"Kids, I'd like to reintroduce you to classic Marge."
Homer,"Not at all, sweetie. At least one of us should be able to put their arms around the other one."
Homer,"Oh, we're gonna do a little more than just ogling."
Homer,Let's go get fried chicken!
Homer,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...
Homer,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...
Homer,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...
Homer,Woo hoo! I got skybox tickets! And with only twenty percent loss of my brain function. Life is...
Homer,"Check out those non-skybox losers, watching hockey without sushi. If you can call that hockey."
Homer,Why can't they just be happy for my success?
Homer,"Fine, watch your stupid Eagles concert."
Homer,Whatever.
Homer,Because she took the trouble to wander away and talk to a stranger.
Homer,Hm. Better add some more nails.
Homer,Perfect.
Homer,"Hey, get out, I'm in here! Oh."
Homer,I go by how funny the sign is.
Homer,Don't worry. We'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. The time will just fly by.
Homer,"Eh, that was boring. Let's get a hotel."
Homer,Stupid Bran Producer's Convention.
Homer,"I know, we'll stay with my very best friend in the world, Lenny."
Homer,"That's Lenny? Oh, I wanted the black one."
Homer,So how do you afford such a sweet pad?
Homer,Who wants to eat a loser?
Homer,"1895, forget it. We'd be too late to save Lincoln and too early to save Kennedy."
Homer,"It's not a time machine, Moe."
Homer,"Marge, I'm still not sure about this."
Homer,I'll teach you to whistle on the Sabbath!
Homer,Where's that kid with my latte?!
Homer,"He's not coming, is he? Is he?"
Homer,"Oh-ho-ho, you look adorable, Lisa."
Homer,"Wow, they had an army helmet under every bed!"
Homer,"Befoul an army helmet? You'd like that, wouldn't ya, hippie?"
Homer,"Finally, I'm no longer a slave to the Gillette Corporation."
Homer,"Why, it says here that President Cleveland has..."
Homer,"Okay, more coal, less coal, less, less, more, less-less-less! Annnd... none."
Homer,Perfect.
Homer,"You know, it's six fifteen, the kids are in bed and Maggie's in her cage..."
Homer,Maybe I could wuther your heights?
Homer,"All right, let's take that..."
Homer,This comes off.
Homer,"All right, let's see what we've got here."
Homer,"You've been in there over an hour, boy! Other people have to confess too, you know. Oh, I can't hold it in. I hate this house!"
Homer,"Look, we can't give up. We're on TV. And when you're on TV, you dig in your claws and you never let go. Just like Bill Moyers!"
Homer,"Oh, I wish you would reconsider the proposal of Hiram Beatwife."
Homer,"Marge, I'm off to the blacksmith to get my tooth pulled."
Homer,Lisa! Explain!
Homer,Marge! Throw me an old-timey rope in an old-timey way!
Homer,"You monsters! You've turned this show into a ""Survivor"" clone."
Homer,"I would never sign that! Unless there was a red sticker that said ""sign here."""
Homer,Where do you get those things anyway?
Homer,Our lives are ruined!
Homer,I can't remember the last time I cried like this.
Homer,"Oh, yes! The tag chafed my throat! Let's go eat some bugs."
Homer,"Savages! I'll handle this, Marge."
Homer,We come in peace. We takem your land.
Homer,"Wow. Marge, I think I figured out their primitive language!"
Homer,And now to wreck their precious helicopter.
Homer,"Yeah, but... okay... Oh..."
Homer,That Lenny sure had a crazy apartment.
Homer,No more reality shows for us. Let's watch some quality scripted television.
Homer,That's it! TV was the one good thing in my life and now I can't enjoy it any more.
Homer,If we formed a club we could serve drinks.
Homer,"Good idea, Lisa."
Homer,"Hm, the water's off. I'll use my eye to see what the trouble is."
Homer,"Hm, off again. Maybe I can hear what's going on."
Homer,"So, this has become a game of wits, has it?"
Homer,Perhaps my other eye will get to the bottom of this.
Homer,Mail call!
Homer,"The ""George Foreman Mail Sorter"" will let us know."
Homer,Your family is invited to a free weekend at Stagnant Springs Spa.
Homer,Don't struggle. You'll only sink faster.
Homer,Do not use steam room if you are overweight or have a heart condition.
Homer,"Wait a minute, I'm not wearing a shirt!"
Homer,"Mmm, steamed Gentile."
Homer,"Triple, no. Definitely no."
Homer,"So, which one of these psychos is gonna help me catch my killer?"
Homer,"Well then, you might as well stay with us. We serve the same meat the prisons do!"
Homer,You'll understand someday when you have kids.
Homer,"Wow, you don't even have to point it at him."
Homer,"Hmm... Well, there's Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, The Emperor of Japan, ex-President Bush."
Homer,"PBS, Stephen Hawking, the fat little Dixie Chick..."
Homer,I'm a people person. Who drinks.
Homer,Gotcha.
Homer,I just wanted to impress you.
Homer,"Mardi Gras, eh? Didn't last year's king have to abdicate because he married a commoner?"
Homer,"Uh, if you two country hens are finished clucking, I'd like to buy a copy of Jugs and Ammo."
Homer,"Look, Junior. I expect this to be fixed with quality GM parts."
Homer,"Just fix it, Mr. Sasswrench."
Homer,"Right, right. I'm countin' the pennies in the ashtray. There's two!"
Homer,You're so smart. Shock him.
Homer,"Ooh, someone's coming!"
Homer,Moe! He's got a dark side I've never dreamed of.
Homer,Once I kill you everyone will think I'm the real Homer!
Homer,"Guys, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think."
Homer,Oh my God! He's getting closer!
Homer,Very well. I am gone!
Homer,Don't look at me!
Homer,Right here.
Homer,Woo hoo! Good things do happen to bad people!
Homer,"Marge, you're embarrassing me in front of the drag queen."
Homer,"Nonetheless, the people have spoken."
Homer,"Marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a Tuesday."
Homer,But I'm not drunk!
Homer,"Now Bob, I know you're concerned, but don't worry. I have operatives working the crowd."
Homer,"America loves its Kings, from George the third to Larry."
Homer,"Phew, just Italians."
Homer,Oh my God! Attention drunken idiots: this is your king! Sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!
Homer,They're not for dudes!
Homer,I did it!
Homer,You saved my life!
Homer,Don't be so sure. I've got my legs wrapped around your ass pretty tight.
Homer,We're up so high. Where could that shot have come from?
Homer,"Well, duh."
Homer,Your king needs these stilts!
Homer,Not anymore!
Homer,"Hey, I know you. You're my mechanic, Junior."
Homer,Frank Grimes...
Homer,Frank Grimes...
Homer,Oh yeah. How is old Grimey?
Homer,"Whoa, wait. Frank Grimes wasn't married. How could he have a son?"
Homer,"We know. Frank Grimes, Jr."
Homer,"Yeah, it's every parent's dream to outlive their children. Goodnight, son."
Homer,Bart! Turn down that original cast recording and go to sleep!
Homer,"Goodnight, sleepyhead. Do you have to poop?"
Homer,You know what made me feel better about myself? That award I got for World's Greatest Dad.
Homer,Which I did.
Homer,Mm... trophy.
Homer,Disney World?
Homer,Gator Gulch?
Homer,"Wait a minute... I know where we're going... Oh, it's horrible..."
Homer,It's even boring to fly over it!
Homer,"Oh, God!"
Homer,Let's go make some fireworks of our own.
Homer,I wouldn't have it any other way.
Homer,"Hey Skinner! Do you and Edna want to join Marge and me at ""Great Moments With Mr. Eisner""?"
Homer,"Oh, you mean the Enron ride. Let's go."
Homer,Who will take home The Rampy?
Homer,Purple Rain!
Homer,Michael Jackson just told me to shut up!
Homer,What a rip! You all should be ashamed!
Homer,"Well, here's ours. We're going to Disney World!"
Homer,"Oh, it's so beautiful."
Homer,"One churro, please."
Homer,Here!
Homer,"Lisa, nobody likes a shill."
Homer,I love that little shill. Let's get her that diary.
Homer,Oh-my-God-oh-my-God-oh-my-God.
Homer,Watch and learn.
Homer,More free samples.
Homer,"Eh, it's still better than Indian food."
Homer,"One Turbo Diary, please."
Homer,Now what am I gonna get Lisa?
Homer,"Lisa's not gonna want that. Oh, what can I get her?"
Homer,What are you buying? Jerk stuff?
Homer,"Hey, your kid is in the movie -- and the movie knows his name. Maybe Lisa will like this better than the diary. Stupid Flanders, you're a genius!"
Homer,I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Homer,"Well, yes and no."
Homer,Mostly no.
Homer,But it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- Lisa Simpson.
Homer,Still? Then you're not gonna like your other present.
Homer,"Maggie, you're her best friend, go talk to her!"
Homer,"Oh, what have I done? Children don't remember bad birthdays, do they?"
Homer,"Good morning, honey. Did you cry out all your angries?"
Homer,"Oh, Lisa's still mad at me."
Homer,I did it for the insurance money.
Homer,"Look Lisa, I'm still trying to get to know you. Who's your favorite Traveling Wilbury? Is it Jeff Lynne?"
Homer,But I'm full of questions. What's your favorite cigar size? Is it Robusto? Is it?!
Homer,"Oh, my daughter hates me because I don't know anything about her."
Homer,"Well... if hiring this guy will make Lisa like me again, then I'll do it! Can I get this beer to go?"
Homer,Drunk cop? Is that you?
Homer,"Ooh, pie."
Homer,My name is Homer Simpson. And I desperately need your help.
Homer,How did you know?
Homer,Priceless.
Homer,"I need you to find out everything about my daughter, so she'll think I'm a good Dad."
Homer,"Anything to trick my daughter into liking me. Now, if you need to reach me, my email is chunkylover53 at AOL."
Homer,It's one word.
Homer,Chunkylover53.
Homer,Dot com.
Homer,"Ah, the information I've been waiting for."
Homer,You should know. It is your favorite album.
Homer,"Wait, wait!"
Homer,I thought you might like to go to an animal rights protest today.
Homer,On the way home we could stop and get your favorite treat: ice...cream!
Homer,"So sad, yet so sexy, yet so delicious."
Homer,"Well, we should get along. I mean after all, I am your... ...father."
Homer,Mom? Don't you think I could read the report by myself?
Homer,"Uh, report is a daddy word that means ""loves his daughter."""
Homer,"That's right, honey."
Homer,"You did it! Lisa thinks I'm the greatest. I might even put you to work on Bart and Maggie, go superdad on all their asses."
Homer,"Oh yes. Well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! How did you spend a thousand dollars?"
Homer,A forty dollar steak?!
Homer,You've been living like a king on my dollar... Super unleaded gas... Silver bullets?
Homer,I can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.
Homer,You'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place!
Homer,Of course I do. It's all my fault for refusing to pay...
Homer,"... pay attention to you, my sweet little father-loving pile of forgiveness. Yes."
Homer,I look just like Elvis!
Homer,"Uh, Rock Strongo."
Homer,"Uh, Lance Uppercut."
Homer,Let me just put on my glasses.
Homer,You're charging how much for a room?
Homer,"Hello, this is a phone survey. If the election were held today, would you vote for ""A"" the cops are there, or ""B"" you are free to talk?"
Homer,"Oh, Marge. You're not gettin' it, it's me. Homer. Simpson."
Homer,"Lisa, this is from your Mom."
Homer,"Lisa, I can't lie to you any longer... this is all my fault. I'm the worst dad in the world."
Homer,The man who framed you is a crooked detective. Who I hired!
Homer,To find out everything about you so I'd seem like a good father.
Homer,"Well, all the childless drunks at Moe's thought it was a great idea."
Homer,"Okay, I'm coming right out the door. Dammit! These windows are so hard to squeeze through!"
Homer,"Cheer up, honey, we're living an all natural existence, the kind you like. Ooh, a trash can. We'll find breakfast in here."
Homer,"Oh, a banana!"
Homer,It's full of cigarette butts. So is this one...
Homer,We'll just tell the police and then I'm back to being plain old Rock Strongo.
Homer,Dexter Colt. The man who framed my daughter.
Homer,"In retrospect, yes."
Homer,I'll just hide here.
Homer,Now what are you gonna do? You can't shoot all of us.
Homer,Damn it!
Homer,"Oh, Lisa has excellent hearing. Once when she was three, I was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!"
Homer,How ironic. Now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see.
Homer,"Well, it wasn't easy, honey, but I'm glad you love me again."
Homer,Yeah. But what's gonna happen to the animals?
Homer,"Don't worry, honey. I released them all into the wild."
Homer,"Why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there..."
Homer,How the mighty have fallen... into my price range. I wanna go there!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,What do I do now?
Homer,"No, I'm good."
Homer,"Hey, your early porno movies! Are any of these hetero?"
Homer,Got any junk that will go up in value after you die?
Homer,The weights that changed you from a Bavarian creme puff to a mass of twitchy muscles?
Homer,I'll take it.
Homer,"No, no worries. This is what all those hours of playing Tetris were for."
Homer,Perfect!
Homer,Do you think you could give me a lift home?
Homer,Your heartbeat is so soothing.
Homer,It's all my fault my wife got mugged.
Homer,"Wait Marge, I don't want you to leave the house without this."
Homer,"Emergency whistle, pepper spray and this map of the most vulnerable parts of a man's body."
Homer,"Oh, like I'm gonna kick Chief Wiggum in the groin."
Homer,Now Dr. Hibbert said to use a number from one to ten to describe how anxious you are.
Homer,Don't worry. Everything is fine. What the hell is that?
Homer,"It's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!"
Homer,"Don't worry, I'll set fire to the hive."
Homer,Run!
Homer,"Yep, but you're still safe at home. After a few practice trips here, the real Kwik-E-Mart will be a piece of cake. Now, Bart will play Apu..."
Homer,"Look, I'm the first to admit it. I don't write good parts for women."
Homer,"Kids, I'll go find your mother."
Homer,"Dad, we're canceling the rest of the play."
Homer,Marge?
Homer,"Listen kids, your Mom is going to be living in the basement. But with our love, she'll get better soon."
Homer,Then we'll have to smoke her out.
Homer,"Why you little... oh, hi Jesus. I was just..."
Homer,"Wow honey, eating dinner downstairs is great! Isn't it, kids?"
Homer,"Bart, eat your spinach."
Homer,Yes way!
Homer,"It's like we're at Cheers. I loved that show. Because you always knew it was only a half hour till ""Wings."" Then you could just sleep till Monday."
Homer,Ow-wooh-wooh-wooh! I'm married to Joey Heatherton.
Homer,"No, actually, I'm going to eat twice as much."
Homer,"Alright Mom! / Yay, Mom! / Woo hoo!"
Homer,"Marge, that was amazing! It's like I'm married to Shaft."
Homer,I'd rather talk about our feelings. I feel that illegal performance-enhancing drugs are too common these days. Rebuttal?
Homer,"Listen, my bulky flower, I-I have an early day..."
Homer,'Mornin' kids! I made your lunches. They're on the table.
Homer,Your mom has a lot of stuff to shave.
Homer,Ow... Ow... Ow... Oww...
Homer,"Quiet, her muscular ears can hear us."
Homer,"Oh, I'm so proud of you, honey. You bulked up, but managed to keep your femininity."
Homer,"Sorry, sir, sorry."
Homer,Denser?!
Homer,Marge?
Homer,"Somewhere in that sea of bull hormones is the sweet, wonderful girl I married. The woman who instead of swatting a fly, will give it a bath and send it on its way. I'd sure like to go home and have Jiffy Pop with her."
Homer,And I miss being your knight in flabby armor.
Homer,"Ready for a real workout, Marge?"
Homer,Good. Can you wax the car? Ow! Ow! Ow! I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Homer,"Yeah, well, nachos are nachos."
Homer,"Wow, I wonder what it would be like to be with a woman like that."
Homer,Mmm... Farfetched.
Homer,Yes...
Homer,Yes...
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Huh?
Homer,I think my leg is broken.
Homer,"Well, I guess Flanders doesn't have all the luck."
Homer,It's not fair. I always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.
Homer,They thought of everything! How come all the good things happen to Jesus H. Nice? By which I mean Flanders!
Homer,The grass is actually greener on Flanders' side.
Homer,"No that's not it. He's got some secret. And I'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes."
Homer,"Flanders, what's your secret? You never get arrested, you don't buy your clothes at ""Mr. Blob"" and look at your beautiful lawn. It sickens me."
Homer,"So that's all it takes, a little prayer."
Homer,"Ugh, where's the remote?"
Homer,"Well, since I don't have the remote, I can just get up and change the channel."
Homer,Wait a minute. I'll do what Flanders does.
Homer,"O, Merciful God, who has blessed mankind with two kinds of clam chowder, help me find the remote."
Homer,There it is.
Homer,"Die, monster!"
Homer,"It worked! I got my wish! From now on, I'll pray till my hands are chapped and bleeding."
Homer,"O Lord, please guide that diaper into someone's schnozz."
Homer,Yes!
Homer,Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. I could do this all day. And I just might. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God.
Homer,"You know, I used to think God only helped professional athletes and Grammy winners. But now I realize he helps shmoes like me, too, Carl."
Homer,"Dear Lord, as I think of you, dressed in white with your splendid beard, I am reminded of Colonel Sanders, who is now seated at your right hand, shoveling popcorn chicken into thy mouth. Lord, could you come up with a delicious new taste treat like he did? I command you!"
Homer,Mmm. Move over eggs. Bacon just got a new best friend: Fudge.
Homer,"Oh heavenly God, my son is plagued with homework. With your vast knowledge of the shore birds of Maryland, I know you can help him."
Homer,Can and will. Now to un-stop this sink.
Homer,"Lord, please use your space-age, clog-busting powers on this stubborn drain. Then take some time off for yourself. Fly to France. Have a nice dinner."
Homer,"Oh Lord, I see thou art working through thy imperfect vessel, Marge. For thou art most wise..."
Homer,"Marge, he's way the Hell up there."
Homer,"Well, we could live with a stopped-up drain."
Homer,You was hiding behind the drywall. Yes you were! I'm glad Social Services didn't see this. Yes I am!
Homer,"Ooh, you coughed up some dry wall."
Homer,So that's your answer! I'll sue the church!
Homer,It wouldn't be the first time.
Homer,I couldn't help it. Those pews are so comfortable.
Homer,Can I borrow your pen to sign this deposition?
Homer,I can't see anything in this fog.
Homer,"Woo-hoo! Can I get that in lottery tickets, please?"
Homer,"He's not giving it to me, God is. Because I prayed for it."
Homer,It's all good.
Homer,"Look, this church is our only option. Don't you kids want to live here?"
Homer,"The dog's on board, too."
Homer,Aw... he thinks he's papal.
Homer,Sweet.
Homer,"Oh, I love this song."
Homer,"I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU, BABY / YOU WERE MADE FOR LOVING ME..."
Homer,"I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU, BABY..."
Homer,We'll just see about that.
Homer,"I'm so sorry for all your horrible problems, but this is our dog's room now."
Homer,"You're right, Marge. I'll make it up to them. By throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!"
Homer,"Bless you, bless you, how you doin'?"
Homer,She went to Lovejoy's temporary church. She's worried about her immortal soul.
Homer,"Eh, God's cool."
Homer,"Oh look, God's giving us a little shower."
Homer,"Everybody, look at the much-needed rain. Thank you, God. Now turn the rainwater into wine."
Homer,"Oh, wet and wonderful God, your flood has driven us to the roof of your church. Surely this has proven whatever point you had."
Homer,God's ignoring me.
Homer,I guess I learned something here. God is capable of great anger and great mercy. But mostly great anger.
Homer,It's such a mess. Watch the teeth!
Homer,I was going to tell you on my deathbed.
Homer,La la la la la la la la la.
Homer,La la la la la la la. Nothing left. La la la... la... la.
Homer,I needed it. I had to buy back some incriminating photos.
Homer,Look. See. You're fine. And then--oops! Uh-oh. Look out...
Homer,"I know this looks bad, but if you reverse it, Daddy's a hero!"
Homer,"See, Bart. I saved you."
Homer,That's okay. His cute little hands can't even fit around my neck.
Homer,Now he's got it.
Homer,"That's right. You're mine till you're eighteen. And when you're seventeen I'm gonna know the end is near, so I'm gonna work you like a dog."
Homer,"Yes, son. At times like this I just look at my bracelet."
Homer,Jesus?! I thought it was Gepetto!
Homer,Who is it?
Homer,"Well, I'm not opening the door."
Homer,Is it crispy?
Homer,But not too crispy.
Homer,See you in court.
Homer,Emancipated? Don't you like being a dude?
Homer,"Hey, my dad was lousy and I didn't sue him. I just dumped him in the cheapest home I could find."
Homer,"Why you little...! Um, I'm sorry, Judge. That's a rare lapse in my normally calm demeanor."
Homer,Why you little...!
Homer,Why you little...! Why you little...!
Homer,"Son, I just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, I'm gonna be the best dad I can."
Homer,Woo hoo! You're still mine! And you thought I was a bad dad before.
Homer,Mmmmm... garnish.
Homer,What the--? Half goes to Bart. Half goes to my Vegas wife. What's left for Moe?
Homer,I'll show you worse!
Homer,I was told this would be televised!
Homer,"Go ahead, leave. You'll come crawling back."
Homer,That's right! Crawling on your knees!
Homer,"Crawling! Oh, he's really gone. He's gone!"
Homer,"Look out, son. This one's got a little mustard on it!"
Homer,Attaboy! We just won the World Series! You and me together! Yeah!
Homer,"Of all the sites on all the web, I had to click onto his."
Homer,"Did you see that, boy? Your mom thinks you're still here!"
Homer,"For your information, I've been taking steps to become a better father."
Homer,For the past week I've been carrying around this bag of sugar. It's taught me how to love and care for a child.
Homer,What the-- where the hell is my sugar?!
Homer,"Hello, son. You're looking well."
Homer,"Of course, because you wouldn't want to... I paid for your splendor, you...!"
Homer,Do it without the attitude or don't do it at all.
Homer,"You know son, I've been doing a lot of thinking. I was wrong to exploit you, and I won't do it again."
Homer,"So, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?"
Homer,"Psst, Mr. Hawk. May I have a word with you?"
Homer,Sure. My son is Bart Simpson and...
Homer,Sorry. I just wanna win my son back so badly.
Homer,"Yeah, I make up words too. Anyway, I was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so I can be a hero to my boy again."
Homer,Groovy.
Homer,All the work?
Homer,"I'm challenging you, Hawk. In front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who can't even get into the army, if you can believe it."
Homer,Not very!
Homer,Now to win back my son in comfort and style.
Homer,"You know, I could save money by buying separate nuts and mixing them at home."
Homer,"Woo hoo! I rule this pseudo sport! Come back to me, boy!"
Homer,"Aw, that's the dumbest thing I ever heard, you stupid little kid."
Homer,"Finally, someone explains it to me in words I can understand. Look, boy. I know I did wrong and I am truly sorry."
Homer,"I put you in humiliating commercials for money, which I spent on myself. I just wish I had an opportunity to make things right."
Homer,Anything... as long as I can give the money to my son.
Homer,Well... I am bald and important. Where do I sign?
Homer,"Well, Kathy, I'll tell you. It's Viagrogaine. It gives you lots of hair and what you need down there. What are you waiting for, loser?"
Homer,What did they say about my scalp?
Homer,It's nice to see a realistic single woman on TV.
Homer,"Wow, I can't wait to pack that into my colon."
Homer,"I got arm veins, don't I?"
Homer,"Mars, eh? Hmmm, I see no evidence of water."
Homer,The Ribwich! The commercials have come to pass!
Homer,You seem like an impartial observer. But I've been fooled by so many people in costumes.
Homer,I could lick you all day long.
Homer,One Ribwich please.
Homer,"Hm, now without lettuce."
Homer,I have eaten the ribs of God.
Homer,"Hey, who doesn't?"
Homer,That sounds like a magical family moment. I'm sorry I won't be there.
Homer,"Oh, sweetie, you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. Only very serious Daddy business can tear me from your side."
Homer,Three Ribwiches please. And instead of a shake I'd like a blended Ribwich.
Homer,"Not again! First you took away my Philly Fudge Steak, and then my Bacon Balls, then my Whatcha-ma-chicken. You monster!"
Homer,"I'd like a large fries, please. And a collector's cup."
Homer,"Wow, this is amazing. I could follow the Ribwich from town to town."
Homer,"Maybe I should hook up with you guys. After all, how long do any of us have to live?"
Homer,You monster! Why did you expel Boogerman?
Homer,That was awesome!
Homer,"I'm sorry, honey. I can't be here tomorrow. It's the last day the Ribwich is in San Francisco."
Homer,You don't understand. It's not just a sandwich. It's about brotherhood. It's about freedom. It's about three days since I've had one! I'm getting the shakes... and I'm getting the fries!
Homer,This can only be good.
Homer,Hey! Don't Borgnine my sandwich.
Homer,The pig?
Homer,"Welcome to the real world, hippies!"
Homer,"Lisa? Is this what I've come to? Fighting over a stupid sandwich on my daughter's big day? Mister, I'll take that car."
Homer,"Daddy made it for your dance recital, honey!"
Homer,Damn right honey. You're number one on my menu. Now super-size it!
Homer,"Yeah, you're the number one speller in this car or in that car or in that car or, don't look at that car."
Homer,It came out again.
Homer,"Enough talk. Dip me, my love."
Homer,Lower. Lower!
Homer,Lower!
Homer,"I know, and it doesn't get any easier from here. There's the Tongue-Kissing Festival... Cinco de Ocho... The Hobo Oscars... days just made for lovers. Not widowers, lovers."
Homer,Flanders?! Can't a man just drink alone on a Wednesday morning?
Homer,Ooh! Lemme guess. Skinner's mother. She sure knows how to swing it.
Homer,Sara Sloane? The movie star?
Homer,"Flanders, I mix Twinkies and Ding Dongs all the time. In Europe they call it a Dinkie."
Homer,Now wait just a minute -- I used to worry Marge was too good for me. She was always thinking of ways to improve me. But then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. So we're all where we want to be.
Homer,"Who the hell is Mr. Flanders? Oh, Flanders."
Homer,"Hello? Yes, I'm Ned Flanders' close personal friend... that's right, hot and heavy... they've never been happier. Oh yes, I she does look pregnant. Now, who might you be? A tabloid? Is that one of those really strong mints? Hello? Hello?"
Homer,"Hey, don't blame me, I voted for the green M&M."
Homer,"Moe, what are you doing here?"
Homer,Stupid Flanders. I'm not giving you any of my secret moves.
Homer,"Look, Flanders. I'm always interested in talking about free milk. And if there's cookies involved, so much the better."
Homer,"Poor Ned, gardening away his misery."
Homer,Me too.
Homer,Uh-oh. Here comes Helen Fielding.
Homer,Droll.
Homer,Mmm... promo.
Homer,"Ew, Fox!"
Homer,Do - you - hear - a - noise?
Homer,Marge germs!
Homer,I'm gonna go calm my nerves with a nice relaxing shave.
Homer,Tissues please!
Homer,Get... out of my... airspace!
Homer,I'm on my way. You man the rake.
Homer,It was an application to open a Cinnabon stand.
Homer,Never!
Homer,Stay plugged in! I will find you!
Homer,"Now Cookie, do you think you can sell this house?"
Homer,"See, it all works out?"
Homer,Make that a chocolate milk and you've got a deal.
Homer,That's a great idea. Why didn't you say something before?
Homer,What?
Homer,I SEE A BAD MOON RISING...
Homer,LOOKS LIKE WE'RE IN FOR NASTY WEATHER...
Homer,I guess there's only one way out of our problems: a murder/suicide pact.
Homer,"It's just an expression, Marge."
Homer,"Eh, I'm still undecided."
Homer,Bo-ring!
Homer,Let him speak!
Homer,"Krusty, you've let everyone down. And even worse, you've let down this sacred document."
Homer,Stained with the blood of American patriots.
Homer,From the unknown toaster.
Homer,Yeah. And to make things even more suspenseful... our plane leaves in a half hour!
Homer,"Beat it, Waxie."
Homer,"Sir, I studied under Ed McMahon!"
Homer,How 'bout before?
Homer,You call this a bicameral legislature?
Homer,"I say, I say... my groin!"
Homer,That's right. Over the homes of poor people.
Homer,"So kids, its Valentine's Day, and you know what that means -- you get to stay downstairs watching TV with the sound turned way up."
Homer,"Oh, we'll be upstairs, in the bedroom making love... ly rope ladders in case there's a fire."
Homer,"Children, so naïve."
Homer,I didn't say anything. So naïve.
Homer,"Oh my darling, nothing is too romantic for you. Have some more liquor."
Homer,"That's it, drink up my pretty."
Homer,"Thanks for the love tip, ""60 Minutes II."""
Homer,"Mm, funky!"
Homer,"Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood. I ate your granny and now I'm in the mood for love."
Homer,But it's St. Valentine's Day! God wants us to do it.
Homer,"Well, my special mix tape will get you going."
Homer,"Oh, no! That's Maggie's mix tape! Then Maggie must have gotten..."
Homer,Shot down on Valentine's Day. That's supposed to be a gimme. Everybody's gettin'some but me.
Homer,Everyone but me.
Homer,Marge doesn't think I'm sexy. What am I supposed to do?
Homer,"Suicide, eh?"
Homer,"That's it! Thank you, outdoor advertising! You saved my marriage -- and not for the first time."
Homer,"""Releasing your inner screenplay,"" ""Create an online kennel,"" ooh, ""Strip for your wife!"""
Homer,Dr. Hibbert? You're the teacher?
Homer,Three coats.
Homer,Aren't you gonna chuckle?
Homer,Nobody loves oily Homer...
Homer,You know everything about me!
Homer,Wipe me down and sign me up!
Homer,"You're preaching to the choir, man."
Homer,"Uh, well, I drew it on... See..."
Homer,"Oooh, published by Kinko's!"
Homer,Yes!
Homer,Yes!
Homer,God yes!
Homer,"Tip one, ""Live each day like it was your last."""
Homer,I don't wanna die! I'm so young.
Homer,"Tip two, ""Let nothing stand in your way."""
Homer,"Listen up, ""life obstacles."" From now on, nothing's gonna stand in Homer Simpson's way!"
Homer,Do your homework!
Homer,Don't do so much homework!
Homer,Learn to talk!
Homer,"You, let's love. Now!"
Homer,Go on ahead. I'll just slow you down.
Homer,"It's the sound of a go-getter at work, Marge. Look, I installed a key hook so you'll always know where your keys are."
Homer,"I finally harnessed the awesome power of the hook. Well, time for work."
Homer,"Megatronics Tip twenty: ""Make your cubicle into a you-bicle."""
Homer,"Hmm. What next, Megatronics? ""Point out problems at your workplace to your boss. To separate yourself from the herd, just tattle on the cattle. Hm."
Homer,And now to see Mr. Burns for the promotion and raise I've deserved since this morning.
Homer,"Mr. Burns, I've made a list of recommendations to improve plant efficiency."
Homer,But the book said you would applaud my initiative.
Homer,"Yes, sir."
Homer,"Ahhh, look at the little eels. Electric eels!"
Homer,"Well, he does. All my life I've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. Mr. Burns has never given me a thumbs up or a ""way to be"" or a ""you go, girl."" No, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small."
Homer,"Thanks for trying, but I'll be at Moe's."
Homer,I gave Mr. Burns the best years of my life. And how much respect does he give me?
Homer,"Moe, we've been complaining about him every night for eight years."
Homer,Revenge? On Mr. Burns?
Homer,"No, I think this calls for something a little more cerebral."
Homer,Wait'll he steps on this flaming bag of... Lisa's college fund?!
Homer,Get rid of a bird? No way. Their eyes are so expressive.
Homer,Why are you looking at me like that?
Homer,"I have a plan to get to the top, but I have to do some pretty rotten things to get there. I'm not sure I could look at myself in the mirror, or any highly-polished metal."
Homer,"This is it, boy. With this bird gone, the plant will be mine for the taking."
Homer,Mr. Burns! The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is here for a surprise inspection!
Homer,Hello!
Homer,Hello!
Homer,Hello!
Homer,Hello!
Homer,"That's right. And as my first act... Mr. Burns, you're fired!"
Homer,"No, it's entirely within my power. Furthermore, there never were any nuclear inspectors. Check and mate. Now, king me!"
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Mr. Burns?
Homer,"Eat crowd, old man!"
Homer,"Hey, that looks fun! Do me!"
Homer,Mr. Burns' reign of terror is over.

Homer,... iffic management!
Homer,"Unlike Mr. Burns, I will respect you, the working class slob, because we are all equals. And now, as I ascend this crystal staircase to my office, I say: avert your gaze!"
Homer,"That is so cool. Bart, open the door."
Homer,"Now, open it again and put a walnut in there."
Homer,You're right. Put two walnuts in there.
Homer,"Sweetie, these things are gonna take time. I just found the door-shutting thing."
Homer,"Oh! Oh, yeah."
Homer,I need a vacation.
Homer,Can't I water ski a little bit?
Homer,No deal!
Homer,"That's great, honey. Hold it up to the camera."
Homer,"Look, there's nothing more important to me than you guys. I f..."
Homer,...best quality pork chops.
Homer,"Lisa, I deeply resent...with a big bowl of applesauce."
Homer,"Well, I have to work, but give the monitor a kiss."
Homer,"C'mon, boy. You're not too old to kiss your daddy's monitor."
Homer,"Hey! That's a printer port, not a finger hole."
Homer,"Hey, honey. Sorry I'm so late. I had to lay off twenty-seven robots. Don't tell me they can't cry."
Homer,Bart's growing up without me. He won't be ten forever.
Homer,Mr. Burns! Where's Mr. Smithers?
Homer,"How did you ever run this place? You've gotta turn away your family, fire your friends, work until the wee hours of the afternoon..."
Homer,"Yes, yes. If I keep putting work first, I'll lose everyone I care about, just like you did."
Homer,"Thank you, Mr. Burns. Thank you for... huh?"
Homer,What are you doin'?
Homer,I don't know why you're trying to steal the plant back. I don't even want it.
Homer,There you go.
Homer,"From now on, my only ambition is to be the world's greatest Dad."
Homer,Quit crowding the plate!
Homer,"Oh, you want a piece of me?"
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Ow! Ow! He bit me! You saw him! He bit me! You little...
Homer,"No, because they pass the savings onto me, the consumer."
Homer,Talking won't get you there.
Homer,"Lisa, what's bumming you out? They cancel a test or something?"
Homer,It's a concern. A serious concern.
Homer,"Sweetie, Daddy doesn't have enough money for that...unless they take a check."
Homer,Boi-oi-oi-oinggg!
Homer,"No, of course not!"
Homer,Duh-uh.
Homer,I have to go.
Homer,Oh my God! Space monsters are invading us!
Homer,"Oh. Well, where do I twist this thing to make funny patterns?"
Homer,"You may be a smart kid, Lisa, but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings."
Homer,Mmm... bad eggs.
Homer,Hey Mr. Smithers!
Homer,It's this new anti-crime dealie. The mayor turned the streetlights way up. My daughter Lisa feels really strongly about it.
Homer,"I'unno. What am I, Superdad?"
Homer,I'll bet somewhere there's a horse drinking coffee.
Homer,"Don't you think you're overreacting, talking gumball machine?"
Homer,Aw... my baby's first words.
Homer,Night... glorious night...
Homer,I wish God were alive to see this.
Homer,I hope it's as fun as Pictionary was last week.
Homer,What? Are you sure?
Homer,"Oh, that takes me back."
Homer,"Oh, I hate this. It's making me use my arms."
Homer,Hey! These two pieces were already connected -- we're halfway there!
Homer,Can't help you -- all I got is gray. Anybody working on a cement wall?
Homer,"Oh, right. Chinese guy, Chinese guy, frisbee dog..."
Homer,It's how the pros do it.
Homer,Now let's see. This is either an old coconut... or Tom Hayden.
Homer,It's the only worthwhile thing I ever made that wasn't Lisa.
Homer,"Prove me wrong, Silent Bob."
Homer,Looks like you're missing a wife.
Homer,"Or when I messed up taping ""City Slickers 2"" and cut off the end. Was Curly's gold just a legend?"
Homer,"Puzzle piece, come out and play-ay."
Homer,"Hey, what's this? ""Marge's Memory Chest."""
Homer,"Aww, Marge saved all this stuff from when we were going out. The fake business card I made up to impress her..."
Homer,T-shirt from our first rock concert...
Homer,Moe's Tavern Grand Opening... That was back when his floors were sticky with promise.
Homer,I can't believe how young we looked... in my memory.
Homer,"Hey, there's writing on the back of this."
Homer,"""Dear Homer, I can't believe you're making this the worst night of my life."""
Homer,The only dangerous amount is none!
Homer,Let's go to IHOP! I'm drivin'.
Homer,"Okay, Burger King! Whatever! C'mon."
Homer,"Why did she stay with me if she hated me so much? Hey, two days later she had a doctor's appointment."
Homer,"Nausea... cravings... knocked-up feeling... She was pregnant with Bart! And that's the reason she stayed with me.,nausea cravings knocked-up feeling she was pregnant with bart and thats the reason she stayed with me,17

88911,308,89,Homer Simpson: (FLATLY) Oh"
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Whatever.
Homer,Marge... did I ruin your life?
Homer,"No, the voters will decide that in November. I was talking about this."
Homer,"More like, where didn't I find it. It was practically everywhere."
Homer,Quit changing the subject. How do you feel about me right now?
Homer,So you mean our whole marriage you've just been resenting me behind my back?
Homer,Fine. I'll go sleep with someone who does appreciate me.
Homer,That was a muffin!
Homer,"Oh, I get it. Your stupid husband is too ""drunk"" to do it right."
Homer,"Oh, so you don't like it when I drink. What other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?"
Homer,"Oh, I didn't realize you've been counting the years. Is it that horrible living with me?"
Homer,"It is to me! Marge, I can't live like this! I'm tired of walking around on eggshells."
Homer,Now you're just making up rules. Who made you Judge Judy and executioner?
Homer,"Kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think."
Homer,"No, no. This is nothing like Milhouse's parents. Now if you need me I'll be staying with Milhouse's father."
Homer,You don't have a doorknob.
Homer,Do I dare to go up? Or is the love that waits behind that window just a lie?
Homer,"Stupid Flanders with his misleading silhouette. Well, I guess I have no choice but to go back home and... hey, I never noticed that newspaper box."
Homer,"""Apartment Finder: We put you in your place."" ""Roommate wanted for three bedroom apartment. Spacious, river view, only four hundred dollars a month!"" Thank you, news box... It's gone!"
Homer,What a well-kept street. And there sure are a lot of gay bookstores for a straight neighborhood.
Homer,It's a cinch these guys never had any kids.
Homer,"What's the deal with this place? It's so manly, yet scented."
Homer,"Nice to meet you, Stuart."
Homer,"Me too. I'm a member of this club where if I eat one more sub sandwich, I get a free sub sandwich. You probably saw the ads, with this guy who used to be fat, but now he's just ugly."
Homer,Are you trying to tell me that you guys are those guys that like guys?
Homer,"You are? Hm, which will win out? My old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that I've already mixed my laundry with yours. I'll have to sleep on it."
Homer,"You guys lead a fascinating life. Like, why are you reading the New York Times? You don't live in New York."
Homer,"Calm down, Picky Ricardo. He made us a great breakfast, and you're just ridin' his butt... and not in a good way."
Homer,"Well, get used to it, 'cause I'm gonna stay."
Homer,Way ahead of you.
Homer,I see.
Homer,"Marge, please. Let's not fight in front of the kids. Just secretly hate me the way you always have."
Homer,Why you little...!
Homer,You noticed! I've been using Lancôme.
Homer,"Well, I'd better go. But before I do, Marge, there's something I want to ask you."
Homer,How much do you tip a leg waxer? I need to know by tomorrow!
Homer,"The kids are cool, but Marge is still judging me."
Homer,"Maybe it is. I used to look at Marge and get the same tingle you guys get when you see Rip Taylor. But now, I don't know what's gonna happen. C'mon, let's dance."
Homer,Tennessee Williams?! But how did he survive in the world of theater?
Homer,Weird Al Yankovic!
Homer,Did you ever get the parody songs I sent you?
Homer,"Which one was better: ""Livin' La Pizza Loca"" or ""Another One Bites The Crust""?"
Homer,"Yeah, like you and Allan Sherman."
Homer,It would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.
Homer,I don't know... date a chick with kids...
Homer,"All right, all right."
Homer,Wait a minute... Marge likes a little bit of stubble.
Homer,Uh-oh. Gotta even it out.
Homer,Margarita... that's Mexican for Marge. I'll take that as a sign!
Homer,"I've learned a lot living here. It doesn't matter what someone's sexual preferences are, unless they're a celebrity, in which case it's dish, dish, dish!"
Homer,"You guys don't have a gay time machine, do you?"
Homer,I gotta go.
Homer,Sorry I'm late -- the Velvet Mafia made me a Margarita I couldn't refuse.
Homer,"But it was Marge. My first and only love. I'm like David Spade without Chris Farley, alone and useless!"
Homer,Wow. Wow. I never realized you felt about me that way. We should really take some time to talk and...I'd just end up hurting you!
Homer,"You know, Moe, I was just thinking. My problems with Marge started because I drink too much. And then tonight alcohol only made things worse. Maybe all of my problems are actually caused by..."
Homer,"Oh, yeah. The night that destroyed my marriage."
Homer,You have that on tape?!
Homer,"So, she didn't hate me. She married me because she loved me!"
Homer,"Marge, I never want to be apart from you again."
Homer,That is the best kiss I've had tonight.
Homer,Manly thoughts.
Homer,Those suck. They're worse than nothing. I could write way better songs.
Homer,"That's it, I'm writing a Christmas carol. If I can make my own clothes, I can do anything."
Homer,CHRISTMAS IN DECEMBER / WOW WOW WOW / GIVE ME TONS OF PRESENTS / NOW NOW NOW!
Homer,Maybe.
Homer,"Flanders, I am a patient, reasonable, handsome man. But even I have my limits. Now beat it!"
Homer,How am I supposed to write a song with that stupid jerk bothering me all the time... Wait a minute...
Homer,EVERYBODY IN THE USA / HATES THEIR STUPID NEIGHBOR / HE'S FLANDERS AND HE'S REALLY REALLY LAME / FLANDERS TRIED TO WRECK MY SONG / HIS VIEWS ON BIRTH CONTROL ARE WRONG / I HATE HIS GUTS AND FLANDERS IS HIS NAME.
Homer,HE'S THE MAN THAT I HATE BEST / I'D LIKE TO SEE HIS HOUSE GO UP IN FLAME!
Homer,"Hey, Mister? If you like my song so much, would you like to buy a tape? It's already rewound."
Homer,Fine.
Homer,His name is Ned!
Homer,Ned's a stupid name! HE'S WORSE THAN FRANKENSTEIN OR DR. NO.
Homer,Don't yell at Ned!
Homer,His wife is dead!
Homer,EVERYBODY HATES THAT STUPID JERK!
Homer,"HE'S YOUR PERKY, PEPPY NIGHTMARE NEIGHBORINO!"
Homer,IF YOU DESPISE POLITE LEFT-HANDERS...
Homer,"Hey, what are we gonna wear tomorrow?"
Homer,Me too -- I've come to hate my own creation. Now I know how God feels.
Homer,"Well, I guess we could afford one nice trip."
Homer,"What? It said ""take one."""
Homer,Sweet.
Homer,And fight the crowds? Forget it. The Simpsons are going to Bart's idea!
Homer,This dude ranch is gonna be great -- a whole week without hearing that stupid song.
Homer,Those poor hats.
Homer,"Coming, sweetie!"
Homer,Can you shoot one where I'm Rambo and my wife is Betty Boop?
Homer,"You people are guests in our country, and the beaver have no right to treat you that way. If I get back your land, will you promise to build a casino on it?"
Homer,How many decks will your blackjack dealers use?
Homer,Three.
Homer,Deal. My brother...
Homer,"All right, son, we just knock over this dam and the noble Native Americans can reclaim the land that is theirs."
Homer,No! I wanted to die choking on food!
Homer,"So long, suckers!"
Homer,Stop shoving! The little one isn't getting any.
Homer,/ Let's see move that there... do a flanking maneuver there... Wind should be coming in from the south... Time it to coincide with a beaver holiday...
Homer,This map is useless! Useless!
Homer,It's the beef hormones and the fluorescent lights. What are you gonna do?
Homer,"Check it out, beavers. Delicious motel furniture!"
Homer,Uh-oh! We forgot to empty the mini-bar!
Homer,That's a seventeen-dollar deck of cards!
Homer,"Quick, find the master log! There's always a master log."
Homer,"We did it! Finally, man has triumphed over a small, furry animal!"
Homer,Fresca?!
Homer,"Look at those stupid city slickers, with their fur coats and pointy hats."
Homer,I still hate them. Go back to Pittsburgh!
Homer,A lot can happen when you're lookin' the other way.
Homer,Who is he?!
Homer,"Woo hoo! In your face, imaginary guy!"
Homer,"Don't worry, son. I'll build you a new treehouse. One so grand it'll be an affront to God himself."
Homer,Only if it's an affront to God.
Homer,Only losers buy wood. We're going to nature's lumberyard.
Homer,"It's okay, Bart. This track has been abandoned since nineteen -- uh-oh."
Homer,Nothing beats flying across the country on a train.
Homer,Did Frank Lloyd Wright have to deal with people like you?
Homer,"Look, I have no idea who Frank Lloyd Wright is."
Homer,I was just puttin' words together.
Homer,"Well, two can play at that game."
Homer,Stop it!
Homer,"Son, that treehouse is gonna be bigger and better than ever. It really restores your faith in helpful weirdos."
Homer,"Heck no, the Amish did it. Who knows more about electricity than the Amish?"
Homer,"Watch your step... Don't panic... By going down the ladder, you are agreeing not to sue."
Homer,Head burning... legs freezing. Middle... very pleasant.
Homer,"Oh thank God, the dog's here! Pull me free, boy."
Homer,"Don't be scared, you can do it!"
Homer,Hey! Where are you goin'? I'm your pal! I took you for a walk once!
Homer,Flames? Searing pain? A black cat? I must be in heaven.
Homer,Move the net under the window.
Homer,I always thought cats were just for losers who live in apartments until my life was saved by this sweet little kitty.
Homer,"But as for you, Santa's Little Helper, you are a selfish coward and a bad dog!"
Homer,"Get out, and stay out."
Homer,"Quit following me, you coward!"
Homer,"All my life, Kent. I prefer ""catsup"" to ""ketchup."" And to me, ""Yusuf Islam"" will always be ""Cat Stevens."""
Homer,"God no, it sucks."
Homer,"Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog."
Homer,Hmm... needs beer.
Homer,Why you little...!
Homer,Fine.
Homer,"I want you to just sit there, look through the window and watch me eat a ham. Marge, prepare the emergency ham."
Homer,"I don't care if his name is Bony McDork, just make the checks out to me."
Homer,Corporate jet?
Homer,Sweet.
Homer,"Welcome back to the family, boy."
Homer,"Who are you, my biographer?"
Homer,"Boy, you're now second best in the family, right ahead of Marge."
Homer,"Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog."
Homer,My wads! I never even broke the wrapper.
Homer,"Aww. There, there, boy. I'll help you get him back. He may have been a dirty, stinkin' coward, but show me a Simpson that isn't."
Homer,"All right, you're not a coward. And that's beside the point because--"
Homer,"A plan, eh? Okay, we'll use a plan."
Homer,Help! Help! I'm drowning!
Homer,Everything is going according to plan. I'll just keep thrashing around like an injured seal.
Homer,"Now let me think. How did that beautiful young naked lady in ""Jaws"" make it out alive?"
Homer,"I'm sorry I was ever mean to you. Marge, prepare the celebration ham."
Homer,"Marge, they're just hams, okay."
Homer,"Well, boy, now that we got you back, I'm never gonna let you go again."
Homer,"To me that says ""I love you."""
Homer,"Aw, it was probably that stupid cat."
Homer,What has he done for me lately?
Homer,"Yeah, but he ate the last can of tuna."
Homer,Everyone's against me.
Homer,"Bart, are you okay?"
Homer,"Hey, take it easy. I went to the video store, to rent a movie for the family..."
Homer,That monkey's wearin' a hat.
Homer,"Look, he's misspelling words."
Homer,"You can't just ""get"" a cell phone."
Homer,Can I get a phone that plays the Mexican Hat Dance?
Homer,"I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AROUND A MEXICAN HAT / I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT / OR IS IT I GUESS I'LL KEEP SINGING / MY CELL PHONE APPEARS TO BE RINGING..."
Homer,"Barney, you ever notice how hard it is to drive with your knees?"
Homer,"Hands-free, eh? Then I could give the brothers the black power salute."
Homer,Black power! Black power!
Homer,Uh... a lighter.
Homer,I'll take 'em.
Homer,DVD player? Check. Snow-cone machine? Check. Lite Brite?
Homer,Check. Fog machine?
Homer,Even I think this is crazy.
Homer,"CHAKA KHAN, LET ME ROCK YOU / LET ME ROCK YOU, CHAKA KHAN / CHAKA KHAN CHAKA KHAN..."
Homer,Oh my God! I've got to do something.
Homer,"Come on, transmit. Transmit!"
Homer,Save me Chaka Khan! Chaka Khannnn!
Homer,I'll never mock the Coast Guard again. You Navy rejects are all right!
Homer,"I am so screwed. I can't drive to work, I can't drive to the store, and I certainly can't drive to the store at work."
Homer,"That reminds me, we gotta pick up my slacks at that dry cleaner in Shelbyville."
Homer,I didn't want them to know my size.
Homer,"Thanks for picking my friends up from the strip club, Marge."
Homer,Where is your mother? I've gotta get to Moe's.
Homer,Public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. I guess I'll walk.
Homer,"Stupid walking, thighs chafing horribly, no drink holder. I miss my car so much -- everyone's driving but me!"
Homer,I did it. I walked all the way to Moe's from my house.
Homer,"You know, I feel pretty good. Maybe I should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar."
Homer,"No. From now on, walking is my beer. And feeling good is my hangover."
Homer,"You know, all this walking is paying off -- look how healthy I am."
Homer,You see? I'm finally thin enough to wrap this thing around my arm.
Homer,"You see? Before, I probably would have driven to the syrup."
Homer,"Calm down, Stresserella!"
Homer,"Now now, honey. We all appreciate what you do. But real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses. You could get in a lot of trouble with the Livery Commission."
Homer,"Marge, you don't know what you're saying!"
Homer,What a day for a stroll.
Homer,Look at those suckers in their metal coffins. I can go to work any way I want.
Homer,Psst. Bishop to queen four.
Homer,"I said, ""Bishop to queen four."""
Homer,"Thanks, Mr. Burns. I owe it all to walking."
Homer,How 'bout we take a family walk around the block?
Homer,"Honey, you seem frazzled. Why don't you come with us?"
Homer,You sure love driving.
Homer,It sure has. You see this bulge back here?
Homer,Now it actually is a fanny pack.
Homer,"No, wait. It's still my ass. But your point is well taken. You see..."
Homer,I LIKE TO WALK DOWN THE AVENUE / BUST A MOVE WITH DISCO STU...
Homer,"YES, I STRUT DOWN THE BOULEVARD / BURNING OFF MY EXCESS LARD..."
Homer,I RARELY FEEL THE NEED TO UTTER D'OH!
Homer,"Top of the mornin', ladies."
Homer,I CAN WALK FROM SPRINGFIELD TO ALASKA / THEN HOBNOB WITH THE STARS IN MALIBU...
Homer,"The guy who got fed into the wood chipper in ""Fargo""?"
Homer,AND WHEN I HEAR...
Homer,"I SAY ""OF COURSE I CAN -- SCREW YOU!"""
Homer,"OH, I LOVE TO PERAMBULATE / IT'S STANDING STILL I REALLY HATE / SO LET ME PLEASE REITERATE / I LOVE TO..."
Homer,My feet are inside me.
Homer,Pretty good. Thanks for asking.
Homer,"It's okay, Marge. It would have been a lot worse if I hadn't been carrying this Bible in my crotch."
Homer,Too hot! Too hot!
Homer,"Hot! Hot! Hot! Warm, tepid, cool, cold... so cold!"
Homer,"Yeah, the doctor says that soon my pelvis will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever."
Homer,"Marge, you're trying to hurt me!"
Homer,"No, it's true. The car, the soup... It's like you hate me... your own husband..."
Homer,"I've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but I never thought I'd hear it from you."
Homer,"Who's ""we""? Got a mouse in your purse?"
Homer,Nothing could be farther from the...
Homer,"You could be on to something there, Doc..."
Homer,"Sorry, I got a lot on my mind."
Homer,"There's Homer... Homer J. Simpson... and Commander Cool, a/k/a me."
Homer,"We've gotta help her. If Marge isn't happy, I'm not happy. And if I'm not happy Moe is very happy. But for once, this isn't about Moe. What should I do, Dr. Hot Dog?"
Homer,You mean... like give her full custody of the kids?
Homer,I see. Do you have any suggestions?
Homer,Here's a dollar.
Homer,Gotta go.
Homer,"I'm gonna treat Marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings."
Homer,You can bring a bag of ice.
Homer,Pick one.
Homer,"Honey, I couldn't keep 'em away if I tried. Except for Flanders. He was mysteriously called out of town."
Homer,"Tonight, we're here to serve you. Sit back and enjoy the finest foods Springfield has to offer."
Homer,That I fixed with new words!
Homer,SO I THREW YOU A FANCY BANQUET / AND NOW YOU CAN'T STAY MAD / HOW 'BOUT A MAKE-UP SNUGGLE? / IT WOULD BE SO RAD.
Homer,So you don't want to kill me anymore?
Homer,Now I'd like to propose a toast: to a woman who's done so much for us without getting anything in return.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"Now, let's all raise our wine boxes... to Marge!"
Homer,"You're welcome. And now Marge, we cooked, you clean."
Homer,"Only teasing. We've flown in the finest busboys from France... I mean, America!"
Homer,"And now, to all my dear friends, I say... get the Hell out of my yard."
Homer,I AM HOMER TRIBAL CHIEF / I AM WEARING TINY BRIEFS / BRAVES TEACH VALUE BOYS SHOULD KNOW / NOW EXTENDED DRUM SO-LO
Homer,I never knew you were such a Beatles fan.
Homer,It's not all his fault. I blame this latchkey kid.
Homer,"Look at me, I'm Brian Epstein!"
Homer,"Now I'm Michael Jackson. I own all your songs, losers. Hee, hee, hee."
Homer,Five-H?
Homer,"Hey, these freaks do a lot of cool stuff. ""Cookouts, hayrides, bowling..."""
Homer,You mean like some sort of madman?
Homer,I'll do it!
Homer,I will now give each of you your specially selected tribal name.
Homer,"Let's see. What Native American activities should we do? Making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the Civil War."
Homer,"The noble Chiefs outsmarted the treacherous Cowboys with a seven-yard screen pass. Unfortunately, after further review, the great father in the sky determined that the receiver's moccasins were out of bounds. I shall bet no more forever."
Homer,"Without the talking stick, we don't hear you."
Homer,"But I was chosen by the Great Spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, I'll be at Moe's talking normal."
Homer,"Hey, treadmill! How do you like this incline?"
Homer,"Uh, I'm giving it back to the earth."
Homer,"Marge, you were an excellent peace-time Chief. But these times call for men of cruelty."
Homer,"Oh, it's too tight! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!"
Homer,Men of cruelty.
Homer,"Okay, Bart. Back up the truck."
Homer,It's laxative-free for today's lifestyle!
Homer,Wait a minute. How could those stupid jar-heads win?
Homer,Well I'm not finished. Where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?
Homer,"Marge, remove that stitching."
Homer,People will do anything a sign tells them.
Homer,"Boy, that slaked my thirst."
Homer,Or did it?
Homer,You talk pretty tough for a man without health insurance!
Homer,"Oh my God, that's my wife, and she's crying."
Homer,How come Lisa always gets to pick the family activities?
Homer,That's because there were seven apostles.
Homer,"Boy, that's a big staff. And still he wasn't that funny."
Homer,Stupid prey. They never suspect anything.
Homer,"Ooo, a hotdog!"
Homer,Flower power my ass.
Homer,"So long, suckers!"
Homer,Woo-hoo! Pedal to the metal!
Homer,Your baby!
Homer,NOOOOOOOOOO!
Homer,Moe! Thank God you saved my baby...
Homer,"Look, Maggie's in the paper with Moe. How cute."
Homer,Look at those pants. They're standing up with no one in them.
Homer,"Oh my God, I'm late for work."
Homer,"It's Patty, chump!"
Homer,"Yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. She--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!"
Homer,"No way! I'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. But if I lose Maggie, I'm oh-for-three. I've gotta get her back."
Homer,"I said, pipe down, Amtrak."
Homer,"Back off, Moe. Maggie wants to be with me."
Homer,This is how we play. THE SQUIRMY WORMY SPIDER / SQUIRTS OUT OF DADDY'S HANDS...
Homer,... DADDY FEELS REJECTED / HE'S GONNA EAT SOME CAKE.
Homer,I recorded that for private use!
Homer,Your turn.
Homer,Moe?! What are you doing here?
Homer,"That's it, Moe. This is just too weird. You are not allowed to see Maggie anymore."
Homer,"Get your own family, Moe."
Homer,Get out!
Homer,Get out!
Homer,"Yeah. You know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own."
Homer,What are you screaming about? Did you discover my snake farm? 'Cause I can explain. I'm going to farm and sell snakes.
Homer,It must have been Moe!
Homer,Thank goodness.
Homer,"Uh, no, that was me."
Homer,I'll get our little passports.
Homer,"Oh my God, I've gotta save her!"
Homer,"We're not. Your sleeve got caught on that tree. Here, let me unhook ya."
Homer,Off you go.
Homer,"Or worse, am I right?"
Homer,"Moe, I was just thinking, if Maggie and I were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham."
Homer,"You kids have got to learn that actions have consequences! Eat fire, punks!"
Homer,Never!
Homer,Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps.
Homer,Death? We don't want any.
Homer,This is for Snowball One and JFK!
Homer,Does this mean they'll never cancel the Jim Belushi Show?
Homer,Nooooo!
Homer,"Death, Death, we miss you so much. You were a busboy in the restaurant of life, clearing away the oldies and the sickies and the chokies. And you made NASCAR racing exciting."
Homer,I'll curb him... without enthusiasm.
Homer,"Ooo, this robe's pretty soft."
Homer,Check it out! I finally found a dead guy's clothes that fit me!
Homer,What? It's not... My hand! What's happening?
Homer,"No way. Forget it. I might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but I am not a Grim Reaper."
Homer,Ow! I'll reap! I'll reap already!
Homer,"Jasper, your time has come!"
Homer,Never mind. I'm Death now.
Homer,Leave everything to me.
Homer,"Pardon me, comin' through, rest in peace, you're dead... Take an dirt nap. Feed the worms..."
Homer,Hm.
Homer,I'unno.
Homer,"Okay, who am I giving the finger to today?"
Homer,Not this! Anything but this!
Homer,Uh... what was that first one again?
Homer,"Okay God, I bumped off the love of my life, according to your divine whim. Now release me from this ghastly vocation."
Homer,Come on!
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,I'm gonna not kill you every week.
Homer,Y'ello?
Homer,"The Nobel Prize! Finally. So, uh it's for what, my whole deal?"
Homer,"If I say no, do I still win?"
Homer,I wish I was Death again. That was cool.
Homer,Hmm...
Homer,I can't go on...
Homer,It was those guys!
Homer,"Just one of life's mysteries, like why is my nose jammed full of army men?"
Homer,Let the baby have her bottle.
Homer,Lisa!
Homer,"Okay, that's good! Stop there!"
Homer,"Yeah, she must have some kind of super-chore in there! Like getting the rat out of Maggie's room!"
Homer,This counts as a bath!
Homer,Whom? Whom?
Homer,"Bart, you're not at school. Don't swear!"
Homer,"Honey, this is your moment in the sun. And I couldn't be more pleased for your happiness."
Homer,Why was I born?
Homer,Oh T-shirt. Bless the loom that fruited you.
Homer,Gotta win a T-shirt. Gotta win a T-shirt.
Homer,"Okay, get ready to laugh!"
Homer,Cranford Man Missing. What's he missing? His pants? A train? Gimme a break!
Homer,"Too soon, huh?"
Homer,"All right. ""Drought threatens to turn west into dessert""? Yum, yum. I think I'd like some whipped cream on my Wyoming!"
Homer,"From what, too much hot fudge? Huh? C'mon Bart, show me some love!"
Homer,This is what happens when I go for six hours without sleep.
Homer,"""Peace talks break down."" No. ""For sale, Ford Festiva..."" I'll put that in the ""maybes."" I gotta get that T-shirt."
Homer,World's Biggest Pizza?!
Homer,Oh my God!
Homer,"Marge, wake up! The newspaper is talking to me!"
Homer,I wish! Look at this headline.
Homer,"Someone, or something, knows I love oversized food and short, punchy articles. So they hid a message in the first letter of each line. See: ""HOMER, MEET ME 4TH STREET OVERPASS, MIDNITE."""
Homer,Wait a minute. This is today's paper. That meeting is tonight!
Homer,"Marge, I don't know what this is, but sometimes you've just gotta go with your gut."
Homer,"All right, I will."
Homer,That's why I don't listen to my brain. And away we go!
Homer,Psst. Hey pal. Hey buddy. Wake up. Wanna go on an adventure with your old man?
Homer,You have no choice.
Homer,There's coffee in the thermos.
Homer,They all do.
Homer,"Hey, the bathroom's a block away."
Homer,"Mom? You're back. Just like you were back before, then you left me again. I love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. Oh, what the heck."
Homer,"Give me a hug, you."
Homer,I know! I'm working my way up to you.
Homer,I think the government has better things to do than to read my mail.
Homer,"You sure know me, Mom."
Homer,I made this when I was five. I had to do something -- your pencils were all over the place.
Homer,"Cora, is there a back way outta here?"
Homer,Fine.
Homer,"Mom, I swear on your eventual grave I will never, ever, let the police get their hands on you. Uh-oh."
Homer,"Now, I'm not a man who's good with words..."
Homer,"I barely know my mother. And every time I see her, she's taken away again. And when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me."
Homer,"I mean, I'm due back in this same courtroom three times today. Hell, I torched a blood bank. One cookie my ass! Please, please, give me back my mommy."
Homer,"Oh Mom, I'm so happy! I never want to let you go!"
Homer,Woo hoo! I can be a little boy again!
Homer,A boy who gets some on the side.
Homer,"Dad, you testified against her!"
Homer,"Look Mom, look! I'm riding by myself!"
Homer,"You weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and I want you to see it."
Homer,"Hey guys, I brought my Mom."
Homer,"Welcome to your room, Mom. I want you to stay here forever."
Homer,Now get out of my house.
Homer,No! I can't lose my mother again! Don't take her away!
Homer,How do you figure?
Homer,You're right. People should only be let out of jail on technicalities.
Homer,Candlepin bowling? That's a great idea. We'll play right after I break your grandmother out of prison.
Homer,"Okay, boy. Flip through those highway warnings 'til we find one that'll stop that bus."
Homer,Next.
Homer,Pass.
Homer,Bo-ring.
Homer,Awww.
Homer,"Haw haw, loser!"
Homer,"Geez, pal."
Homer,"Mom, I love you! I can't let you go to prison!"
Homer,"Oh, stop it."
Homer,"Take care, ladies. I'm sure you can make it back to the prison on your own."
Homer,"Mom, I'm gonna hide you where there's no one around for miles... Disney's California Adventure."
Homer,"No, you're my mother and I won't leave you!"
Homer,"Yeah, that did mess me up pretty bad. But I'm not gonna leave you."
Homer,"Ooh, that's lucky."
Homer,Brambles! Briars!
Homer,Go Mom! You can do it!
Homer,Nooo!
Homer,Bear?!
Homer,Your last act as a mom was to make me a better dad. But at least now I'll never lose you again.
Homer,"I couldn't sleep, because I thought there might be a sign of my Mom in one of these articles. They never did find her body."
Homer,"Last week's garbage. I missed the pick-up date. But it doesn't matter, because my Mom is alive. See?"
Homer,"I-M-O--,i-m-o--,1
91096,315,285,Homer Simpson: --K. Get it? ""I am OK."""
Homer,"Ooh boy, casino night! Finally, they'll teach our kids the dangers of doubling down on a six."
Homer,"Aw Marge, I bet you've gotten that out of your system."
Homer,I'll put everything on lucky seventeen.
Homer,Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,I win!
Homer,"This is it, baby. First thing tomorrow, we're getting a Playstation One!"
Homer,I'd like to cash in these chips. Give me most of it in cash and the rest in suitcases to carry the cash.
Homer,But I'm up two hundred thousand dollars! Give me my money!
Homer,You think I won't manhandle a little boy?!
Homer,Why don't you start a rumor that he's...ding-a-ling-a-ling hello-oo!
Homer,"Oh, what a delicious quiche! I drive a pink Miata."
Homer,"La, la, la..."
Homer,My name is Nelthon! I use a thalad fork. La-dee-dah! I wash my face!
Homer,Clothesline.
Homer,I wish I'd married a businessman. Then I'd have nice things.
Homer,"Oh, I'm so confused."
Homer,"On my chess set, the pawns are all Hamburglars."
Homer,"Lisa, you've got to stand up to these guys. And when you do, people will remember you. Just look at these postage stamps."
Homer,There's Bugs Bunny... Fat Elvis... Autumn in New England... Bats of the Southwest... all heroes. Wanna see Elvis kiss a bat? Hey baby come here lemme kiss you...
Homer,"Squeak, squeak, squeak. No, don't kiss me."
Homer,No way! I'm saving for a speedboat!
Homer,I'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! You can't go to that school!
Homer,"Why can't you have a normal dream, like being an Olympic figure skater?"
Homer,Are you crazy? I'm not getting up at six-thirty every morning so you can prance around a frozen pond and think you're better than me!
Homer,I'unno. How 'bout a horse whisperer?
Homer,Over my dead body!
Homer,One thousand dollars. Do you know how much furniture we could rent with this?
Homer,"Marge, this is why people don't tell you things."
Homer,"Well, we put up a flyer."
Homer,You know the drill. Try to land on my back-fat.
Homer,Can you describe the bill?
Homer,IT'S BART'S MOON PARTY FROM OUTER SPACE...
Homer,What?
Homer,We've gone on plenty of great vacations.
Homer,I still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.
Homer,"Well, I'd like to return to Brazil. But I hear the monkey problem is even worse now."
Homer,"Marge, I'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. Now let's see, which rifle should I bring?"
Homer,Would an American dollar encourage you to leave us alone?
Homer,The place I was born is now a gator farm.
Homer,Wow. I can't believe we met Mr. Bean.
Homer,"Make with the tea, Jeeves."
Homer,"We're bigshot tourists from everyone's favorite country: the USA. We saved your ass in Vietnam and shared our prostitutes with Hugh Grant. So give me some free maps, and none of that dry British wit."
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"Aw Dad, I wish there was something I could do."
Homer,Touch that mini bar and you're dead!
Homer,"Fish? I don't know, I'm not really a vegetarian..."
Homer,"Well, Marge, you've gotta admit. I've been on my best behavior this trip."
Homer,That was over soccer results! Can you believe they gave Giggs a yellow card in the box?
Homer,"I understand the word ""gave."" Unless it means something else in this country."
Homer,"Now, now, let's just look... there's Big Ben, there's Piccadilly Circus, there's Jimmy Page, one of the greatest thieves of American black music who ever walked the earth. Bup, there's the kids."
Homer,"You can't bet on my kids. This is America, pal!"
Homer,What? What play?
Homer,"You mean ""Macbeth""?"
Homer,"What? By saying ""Macbeth""?"
Homer,Saying what?
Homer,"Mr. Macbeth, I'm really sorry."
Homer,"But please, find it in your jewel-encrusted heart to forgive me."
Homer,"Yes, this trip is entirely uneventful."
Homer,I see an opening.
Homer,That's it. I'm acting the way America acts best -- unilaterally.
Homer,"Okay, I'm gonna go over there and see if they're cool."
Homer,"Okay, let's see. Oh, you can buff that out, you can buff that out, that's factory error, that thing's supposed to be on fire..."
Homer,"Lady, please. Get back in your overturned car. Let the guys handle this."
Homer,Your Majesty?
Homer,The Queen of whaaa?!
Homer,Wait! We have to exchange insurance!
Homer,Back cuts?
Homer,"My Lord, we Americans love queens, be they homecoming or Dairy. This woman, however, is an imposter."
Homer,"Her luggage is inscribed ""H.R.H."" -- which means her real name must be... Henrietta R. Hippo."
Homer,"Your Honor, I've completely disappointed my wife. That's punishment enough. You understand these things, you're a grandmother."
Homer,"Ohh, and a very manly one, if I may say so, m'lord."
Homer,"Boy, she's good. If she were a hundred years younger... and I were a hundred years older..."
Homer,America rules! Our Beatles are way better than your precious Rolling Stones!
Homer,"Oh Marge, I Am so sorry. I should've listened to whatever it was you were saying."
Homer,"Well Marge, if I die here, there's one thing I want you to remember: don't buy any videotapes in England. They won't work in our VCR!"
Homer,"Dear God of England: please let me go. In return I will spell the word ""color"" with a ""u"" and I'll use the metric system with every cubic milliliter of blood in my... oh, I can't do it. It's so stupid!"
Homer,A secret tunnel? I don't know. Won't that get me in more trouble?
Homer,"Okay, what do I do?"
Homer,"Sweet freedom, here I--"
Homer,"Boy, it's a good thing I'm leaving before I went nuts. Goodbye Sparkly Elves."
Homer,"Boy, a Krispy Kreme would really clean up down here."
Homer,"Hey, this place is amazing. It's fit for a Duke, or even an Earl..."
Homer,"Please, your Majesty, I know that I, like many other Americans, have behaved like a total buffoon."
Homer,"But we Americans are England's children. I know we don't call as often as we should, and we aren't as well-behaved as our goody two-shoes brother Canada, who by the way has never had a girlfriend, I'm just sayin'."
Homer,Only my hairdresser knows for sure.
Homer,"See ya in Atlanta, jerk!"
Homer,"Lady, you're gorgeous. You make Dame Edna look like a dude!"
Homer,"Okay, Mother's Day gift check. Let's see what you got."
Homer,Flow... yeah.
Homer,"Bart, we made her the same thing!"
Homer,"Kids, we're going Mother's Day shopping! I'm glad this holiday only comes every four years."
Homer,"Let's see, what would she like?"
Homer,Twenty on the trifecta?
Homer,Her wedding china back?
Homer,"I could get Marge a new window, just like this one."
Homer,"Yeah, I love Sprawl-Mart. They've got everything. Even Christian videos with talking vegetables."
Homer,"Mmm, Moses."
Homer,How dare you challenge my perceptions of what old people can do?
Homer,"Yeah, it's impressive. But I still haven't found the perfect gift for Marge. Only imperfect stuff for me."
Homer,"Well, well, if it isn't Fatty and Smell-ma."
Homer,"Wow! I never thought I'd say this, but you slags are all right."
Homer,"Marge, you're gonna love my present. It is so thoughtful it makes the kids' gifts look like crap."
Homer,"Whoa, Marge, get a room!"
Homer,"Hmm, dare I pour caramel over the cotton candy?"
Homer,This is eighty-five pounds of tooth-melting sugar. Dig in!
Homer,"That's it, kids. Suckle Daddy's sugar ball."
Homer,That's my old lady.
Homer,Ants!
Homer,Birds!
Homer,Cats!
Homer,Flanderses!
Homer,"Maybe you're right, Marge. Or maybe you're right, candy ball. No, Marge. Then again... No, Marge. Definitely Marge."
Homer,"Goodbye, old friend. I'll think of you whenever I have a stroke or a heart attack."
Homer,"Oh my God, I'm gonna be killed by a bear! Well, I guess I don't have to worry anymore about the dangers of smoking."
Homer,Smooth.
Homer,"Marge, please. I'm too upset to talk about it."
Homer,"I did a lot of stuff today. I went to Starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape."
Homer,Choke on your candor!
Homer,It's a deal!
Homer,Hello? Anyone home?
Homer,Marge? Maggie?
Homer,"""The Bear Went Over The Mountain""?! ""The Berenstain Bears""?! Ahhh, Goldilocks... and the Three Bears!"
Homer,"Oh God, they're in our food! Teddy Grahams, Gummi Bears..."
Homer,Are you a Care Bear?
Homer,Why does a bear need a crowbar?
Homer,"No, go ahead."
Homer,Can I fight human-style? By slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile?
Homer,"You cowardly Swede! You face that bear like a man, or I'll never speak to you again."
Homer,But how will I find out what you had for lunch in nineteen twenty-eight?
Homer,"Finally, science has joined forces with revenge."
Homer,Lookin' good. And I did it all without wasting money on one of those stupid welder's masks.
Homer,"Check it out, ladies. The suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack."
Homer,"I know. If I get really scared, I don't want to ruin the suit."
Homer,"Rub a dub dub, I'm washin' the blub."
Homer,What kind of an example would I be if I didn't take revenge on things?
Homer,"Lisa, the point of Moby Dick is ""be yourself."""
Homer,Fine. But do you know how ridiculous you look right now?
Homer,"Marge, you awake? Marge?"
Homer,"Gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him."
Homer,"No way. If something happens to me, you have to carry on the Simpson name."
Homer,"That is so cool. All right, you can come."
Homer,I never realized how hot this suit is. I'm sweating out all my blood-lust!
Homer,Suh-weet.
Homer,Oh my God! Lenny! Carl! Bart?
Homer,"I guess this is it. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die a man."
Homer,Is this thing hurting you?
Homer,"Okay, it's probably the tag. But just to be sure..."
Homer,"Hey, you're not mean. It was just this tag that made you go ape-scat. We're not so different. Give me a hug."
Homer,Jeez! I don't know why bear hugs enjoy such a great reputation.
Homer,That's funny.
Homer,"Oh no, the hunter has become the hunter!"
Homer,He must be following this thing. Well I'm gonna make sure it never harms another living creature.
Homer,"Wrong again, liberal media."
Homer,"Don't worry, I'll find you someplace safe."
Homer,"Okay, you wanna go over there."
Homer,Hold on. Something doesn't feel right.
Homer,Wait! Stop! I know bullets can be scary sometimes. But I have an idea. First we pull off all of your fur.
Homer,"All right, all right I'm still thinking!"
Homer,"They're looking for a male bear, right?"
Homer,"It's so easy to condemn, so hard to create."
Homer,What can I say? I love nature...
Homer,Circle of life.
Homer,BAH-DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH...
Homer,TIME TO WHIZ IN A FOAMING BOWL OF CHINA...
Homer,A line for the bathroom? What gives?
Homer,"Son, can I have cuts?"
Homer,Sweet.
Homer,Now calm down. I'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.
Homer,"Oh God, it's baby blood!"
Homer,Bart! You're not hitting hard enough!
Homer,The door? Now I'll never get to pee.
Homer,"You just lost a box, pal!"
Homer,"Yeah, well uh, funny thing about that..."
Homer,"On our way to the clinic, I decided to give him a night his wang would never forget."
Homer,Wanna play some air hockey?
Homer,You're on!
Homer,"I can't neuter you, boy. Not after all we've been through."
Homer,"But from now on, you better save your lovin' for the couch cushions!"
Homer,You broke our deal -- we had an oral contract!
Homer,I'm your man!
Homer,"Welcome to the Homer Simpson Show. I'm your host, Next Card. Homer Simpson it's great to be here in Next Card. Springfield my guests are...Moe Szyslak, local businessman, Carl Carlson, raconteur, and Lenny Leonard, three-time juror. Gentlemen, what's on your minds?"
Homer,Ever notice how seats are too small for normal-looking guys like me? Theaters... airplanes... why even here. Look!
Homer,Who has more power? Miss America or Miss U.S.A.?
Homer,"Why so formal, Lenny? You're my go-to guy."
Homer,Interesting...
Homer,"Please welcome new panelist, Barney Gumbel."
Homer,"Please welcome my newest panelist, Disco Stu."
Homer,My pleasure.
Homer,"So did I, son. And look where I am today."
Homer,"Boy, everybody loves my show."
Homer,"Yes, you're right..."
Homer,"Duck, Mr. Lincoln!"
Homer,"Well, I took Bart's advice last week, so I guess it's Lisa's turn. Now, if you'll excuse me..."
Homer,"You hit him high, I'll hit him low!"
Homer,"Y'know, we've had a great time on this show ""riffing"" on small, unimportant subjects."
Homer,"Well, that's all over now. From now on, we will focus solely on important issues."
Homer,"Every year the gulf between rich and poor nations gets larger. Yet, the IMF insists on unrealistic debt-repayment schedules."
Homer,Why should America consume ninety percent of the world's resources? Argentina must devalue her currency to pay her debts!
Homer,"You can't leave, I'm your ride home!"
Homer,I'll audience you!
Homer,"Marge, I thank God every day you settled for me."
Homer,"Hey, where's my car?"
Homer,Will you make my sundae for me?
Homer,I'm hungry. Are they married yet?
Homer,Then whose garter is this?
Homer,I love the holiday season.
Homer,"See you in spring, toes!"
Homer,Oh my God! A DVD player.
Homer,"Oh Carl, you remembered I like TV!"
Homer,"Oh yes, I am... your present is right in the other room."
Homer,"Come on machine, take my dollar!"
Homer,"Fine, we'll play it your way."
Homer,"Here you go, Lenny."
Homer,"May the spirit of Retsin be with you all year long. God bless God, amen."
Homer,Oh c'mon... Mr. Burns is way more selfish.
Homer,That evil old bone bag... smelling of death... nose like a vulture... followed everywhere by that kiss-ass Smithers...
Homer,Joe DiMaggio?
Homer,I need money for Christmas... can I get anything for this Joe DiMaggio baseball card? It's kinda old.
Homer,Thank you! Freak.
Homer,"Hey, everybody! We're going shopping at the Springfield Heights Promenade!"
Homer,"First we'll buy gifts for each other. Then we'll spend the rest of the cash on a Christmas tree so large, its absence from the forest will cause mudslides and flooding."
Homer,"Doing pretty good so far. A key ring for Marge, key ring for Bart..."
Homer,That thing for me.
Homer,"Oh God, it's so unnecessary!"
Homer,I'm upside down so much!
Homer,"Oh, if I buy this, I won't have anything left for a Christmas tree..."
Homer,That's the birthday I'm always forgetting. I must have it!
Homer,"Uh, sure, you know it. The biggest tree from the finest lot in town!"
Homer,"It's fine. Everyone just relax, lock your doors, don't make eye contact with anyone and listen to the radio."
Homer,Exactly.
Homer,"Gorgeous, huh? And quite the bargain."
Homer,"Oh, it just needs a little love."
Homer,Why do the things I love always burn?
Homer,Isn't it sufficient.
Homer,Uh... Woo hoo! Maggie's talking!
Homer,"There's a trickle-down theory here. If I'm happy, I'm less abusive to the rest of you."
Homer,"Oh, this is sadder than ""Tuesdays With Morrie."""
Homer,"C'mon Marge, I'm not the only selfish person. You have to get your hair done at ""Supercuts."" I guess regular ""Cuts"" just isn't good enough for you."
Homer,That's not true. I cared what you thought once you found out.
Homer,Can't you yell at me now and get it over with?
Homer,"I don't need her, I've got you, Astrolabe."
Homer,Jimmy Stewart as a puppet is just wrong.
Homer,"Mr. McGrew! I love that blind, senile old man."
Homer,I heard you the first five times.
Homer,Oh McGrew. Once again you've mistaken something for something!
Homer,Oh my God! It's like looking at a cartoon version of myself.
Homer,"C'mon, Death. Leave McGrew alone. Take Tiny Tim."
Homer,Unloved by Al? Noooooooo!
Homer,Unloved by all! Noooooooo!
Homer,"Children, children, what day is this?"
Homer,Thank God! There's still four more days 'til Christmas. I have time to reform my ways!
Homer,I just saw the greatest cartoon of all time. It was about a miser who was visited by three ghosts at Christmas. And get this: he learns a lesson!
Homer,"Marge, TV and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson. From now on, I will stop being selfish and start being good. In fact, I'll be the nicest man in town."
Homer,"Yes, but this time I'm sober. Ish."
Homer,"No need, Flanders. I've already given them my old clothes."
Homer,Good-lookin' group.
Homer,You're welcome!
Homer,"Look, Lenny. I know I was a pretty bad Secret Santa, so I wanted to make it up to you."
Homer,"And I filed down all the sharp corners. See, your eye is completely safe."
Homer,"Marge, do you want this last pork chop?"
Homer,"All right, now you're startin' to creep me out."
Homer,I'm not looking for glory or wealth. I'm just buying that stairway to heaven Jesus sang of.
Homer,"Get back to your bong, hippie."
Homer,Just like the Pope!
Homer,"Being unselfish is a natural high, like hiking or paint thinner."
Homer,And here's another act of Christian charity I pulled out of my butt.
Homer,I built a skating rink for the whole town!
Homer,"Here's your skates. Oh, you'll have to take off those boots."
Homer,Ewww.
Homer,Pathetic Flanders. Thinking he can buy people's love with thoughtful gifts.
Homer,I'll show Flanders. I'm gonna get everyone a car. What's that one good American car?
Homer,Uh... is it despair?
Homer,Hmm. You've given me a lot to think about.
Homer,"I've got it... when everyone's asleep, I'll take away their presents. Then they'll be happy! Thanks, Buddha."
Homer,"YOU'RE A HERO, HOMER J. / YOU'RE AS CRAFTY AS A SKUNK / THEY'LL THANK YOU IN THE MORNING FOR STEALING FLANDERS' JUNK / HOMER JAAAAAY! / You're a double-bacon genius-burger... AND JUST A LITTLE DRUNK."
Homer,Now to hear the joyous sound of people waking up on Christmas to discover they have no presents.
Homer,"They don't sound happy... but here comes a mob, shaking their fists in gratitude."
Homer,"Um, shouldn't you all be singing carols or something?"
Homer,"Wait a minute, everyone! There's your Christmas up there!"
Homer,"Let's just say that on this day, a million years ago, a dude was born who most of us think was magic, but others don't, and that's cool. But we're probably right. Amen."
Homer,"And now, I think the only thing left to do is -- return all your gifts! Ned?"
Homer,"Look, Maggie! Funny Daddy!"
Homer,Too hard.
Homer,"Give Daddy the remote, Maggie. Give daddy the..."
Homer,"Oh. Wise guy, eh?"
Homer,Nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh.
Homer,"Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!"
Homer,You can't change the rules in the middle of the game! We never would have had these kids if we'd thought we had to pay for 'em. Promises were made!
Homer,Then why did you appear in it?
Homer,Maybe she was you and you're not! How many kids do we have?
Homer,"Wrong, lady! Oh wait, the baby."
Homer,"Honey, this marriage is a partnership. When you fall, I pick you up. And when you can't finish a sandwich, I eat that sandwich."
Homer,And I promise this rock is gonna weigh you down for the rest of your life.
Homer,"Honey, no one messes with my Mrs. I'll come down on those guys like the garage door on Bart's bike."
Homer,"You just leave everything to Homer. And now, I believe you owe me half a sandwich."
Homer,"Here comes my commercial. In six, five, four..."
Homer,You've probably heard a lot of bad things about Families Come First.
Homer,"But newspaper writers are a bunch of jerks. Who really opposes ""Families Come First?"""
Homer,"Many childless advocates are like Ben Affleck -- famous, successful people from out of State!"
Homer,They live in fancy houses in other places.
Homer,"""Families Come First"" is supported by lifelong Springfieldians you know and trust like me, Milhouse's Dad, Bumblebee Man, Surly Duff, and that jerk that goes ""Yeees!"""
Homer,"For more information, visit our website, www.al-jazeera.com. We're not affiliated. We're just piggybacking on their message board."
Homer,I am Rudy Giuliani. Do as I command you. I am Rudy Giuliani. Do as I command you.
Homer,Either way. The important thing is the system works.
Homer,Great. Let's dump these kids in an R-rated movie while we go someplace nice.
Homer,"Marge, wait."
Homer,I am Rudy Giuliani. You must forgive Homer. I am Rudy Giuliani. You must forgive Homer. I am.
Homer,What do I care?
Homer,"Bart, that creepy kid's here!"
Homer,A ten-speed bike?! What did your mother say?
Homer,I'm confused! Which is it?
Homer,"Yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike while your old one still works."
Homer,That's right. No questions asked.
Homer,"There, there. You're both right."
Homer,"Son, would you like to ride your new bike out of the store?"
Homer,"For true, son."
Homer,Here we go. Now it starts with the fees.
Homer,I'll assemble it myself.
Homer,I can make a bike. I made you.
Homer,"Hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets some day."
Homer,"Oh man, this is so confusing."
Homer,What the Hell is this?
Homer,Bike's over there.
Homer,Son are you okay? I brought my home-made first aid kit. It's spring-loaded for quick access!
Homer,"First of all, thank you. Secondly..."
Homer,"There's nothing worse than the look on a boy's face when he says ""Dad I don't think you can build a fully-functional robot."""
Homer,"Robot, I command you: do something cool!"
Homer,I could quit now... but then my son will never look up to me. Why was I born a Dad?
Homer,Why... do... I... suck?
Homer,Wait a minute. What is it my Dad always said to me?
Homer,That's it!
Homer,"Oh, the beer's gone. I'll have to suck it out of the shag."
Homer,Like a dog. Or a snowman!
Homer,"""...I'd love to be with you, but I just remembered an old army buddy has come to town. Will meet you later. Love, Dad."
Homer,Doin' it for the boy...doin' it for the boy... pain is love... to bleed is to care...
Homer,"Woo hoo! I mean, beep beep!"
Homer,Pretended.
Homer,Various bug bites and wounds. Now stop interrupting your brother.
Homer,"I like you, son."
Homer,"Not so rough, Bart. Daddy can't handle so much love right now."
Homer,"Well, I've been busy, son. They really need me over at the nuclear plank."
Homer,"I don't think so, son. But on the other hand, I may be closer than you think."
Homer,So much metal in my eye.
Homer,Oh no! My recurring nightmare is coming true!
Homer,"There are many people I'd like to thank for this award. My wife, Anjelica Huston -- this is for you, Angie! We did it!"
Homer,"Listen son, there's something I have to tell you about our robot."
Homer,Uh...
Homer,I just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty!
Homer,"And if anything happens to me, I want you bullies to take care of my boy."
Homer,I wish I had bullies like you growing up.
Homer,"You think you've got problems, look what I just pulled out of my arm!"
Homer,"That's what we in the business call ""a biggie."""
Homer,The business of being a Dad. Can you hand me that magnet?
Homer,Can you do my back?
Homer,"Bart, I'm sorry -- I could never build a robot this awesome. I'm a fraud."
Homer,Affirmative.
Homer,You really think so?
Homer,And I'm the luckiest--
Homer,"Hey, what gives? He's not killing me!"
Homer,He knows just how I like my martinis... full of alcohol.
Homer,"Bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside."
Homer,Keep me focused.
Homer,"Son, did you ever suspect it was me?"
Homer,"Yeah, I'm pretty unreliable."
Homer,"Let's see... I'll have sixteen gravy scrape 'ems, a bucket of twisty lard, and two super-choker breakfast burritos with macho sauce. And mega-size it, please."
Homer,Great. And I'll have a diet coke. Deep fried.
Homer,Hmm... need more lap.
Homer,I can't see! I'll have to steer by the reflection in my watch!
Homer,Why don't I just pull over?
Homer,It's stuck! Krusty collectible toy jammed under brake pedal!
Homer,Oh no! I hit the grief counselor!
Homer,I had a car!
Homer,I gotta get a job before Marge finds out I was fired.
Homer,That's it! I'll steal this sign and they'll pay me to make them a new one!
Homer,We'll clean out those stupid Americans.
Homer,"...you probably want to talk this over, so I'll leave you two ""alone."" Excuse me."
Homer,They'll be back.
Homer,He was my best friend.
Homer,"Cool, an ambulance from the '60s! I bet a lotta hippies were denied care in this thing. Injured hippies!"
Homer,I'll do it!
Homer,Guess what? I quit my job as a used car salesman.
Homer,"Get with the program, Marge. Your husband is now an ambulance driver!"
Homer,Maybe on planet ZooZoo.
Homer,"Kids, kids. Those aren't your toys. They're to keep Daddy asleep and awake."
Homer,I'm gonna need them on my first shift tonight.
Homer,"Slow down, Picasso! You were gonna start a novel without informing me?"
Homer,I also fed some ducklings.
Homer,"Fine, fine. I'll take the kids tonight, and you go to your precious hair appointment."
Homer,Whatever. But I think you look great already.
Homer,"Where to, Mack?"
Homer,"Hospital, eh? Wow, everyone's goin' there tonight."
Homer,Why don't you admit I know it's around here somewhere?
Homer,"Marge, I'm back!"
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need some dinner, stat! And the kids need some CPR lessons."
Homer,I'll say.
Homer,"Oh good, you can use that to take down my dinner order. I'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice."
Homer,Marge! We're out of bath towels.
Homer,"Ooh, ice cream truck!"
Homer,HERE IN MY CAR / I AM HOSING OFF BLOOD / SOME OF IT'S MINE / BUT MOST OF IT'S NOT / HERE'S MARGE...
Homer,"Ooh, typed!"
Homer,No problem.
Homer,Two hundred and eighty-six pages!
Homer,Woo hoo! I'm half-way through!
Homer,"All right, ""Chapter One."" Hm, that makes sense. ""There once was a girl from Nantucket..."" Good, good... ""Her name was Temperance Barrows and her heart was heavy with feeling. She..."""
Homer,"No! Gotta read Marge's book. Can't get distracted. Hm... ""distracted,"" that's a funny word. Does anyone ever get ""tracted?"" Let me call the suicide hotline and ask them."
Homer,Well what?
Homer,"Oh, yes."
Homer,I did.
Homer,No! They were all in their own way totally awesome.
Homer,"As I've always said: ""publish or perish""!"
Homer,"So, how much bleach did you drink? Not a talker, eh?"
Homer,"Apu, do you sell Crazy Straws? I've got a guy with a broken back and I'm tryin' to cheer him up."
Homer,What are you talking about?
Homer,Why do you keep talking that way?!
Homer,"Well, then maybe I will."
Homer,That one I got.
Homer,"I'll have to read Marge's book. And I swore never to read again after ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" gave me no useful advice on killing mockingbirds. It did teach me not to judge a man based on the color of his skin, but what good does that do me?"
Homer,The Harpooned Heart. Book on tape! As read by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.
Homer,How can you write such horrible things about me?
Homer,I didn't lie. I was writing fiction with my mouth.
Homer,Just tell me how much of this is true!
Homer,I knew it! And what about the romance between you and Cyrus?
Homer,"Well, I'll make sure you never imagine anything again."
Homer,Flanders!
Homer,Open this door right now!
Homer,What are you doing here?
Homer,"Flanders, pull over! I'm an ambulance!"
Homer,"Flanders, I'm gonna do something I shoulda done a long time ago."
Homer,Would you help me be a better husband?
Homer,In Marge's book I was so mean and you were so nice. How can I be more like you? Just give me some advice.
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,"Why would I rub her back unless I wanted to get some... oh, to make her feel good."
Homer,"That's right. I love you Marge, and I realize now I should show you more often. The end of your book was the wakeup call I needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book."
Homer,"Don't worry about those losers, Marge. I think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own."
Homer,"Marge, I've got it all figured out: Lee Harvey Oswald wanted to steal the Jack Ruby."
Homer,"All right, we're back to square one. Put on some coffee."
Homer,I was so close.
Homer,"All I know is the guy who played Mozart was also in ""Animal House."" Now there's a movie with good music. ANIMAL HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE... / NOBODY EVER WENT TO CLASS... / THEN WE SAW DONALD SUTHERLAND'S ASS... / ANIMAL HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE... /"
Homer,"ROLLIN', ROLLIN', ROLLIN' / TOXIC BARREL ROLLIN'"
Homer,"To old man Burns, who's paying us to drink because we're embarrassing!"
Homer,A lot of that went in my lungs.
Homer,"That's great. I'm honored to drink to Apu and, uh... Apulina."
Homer,"You know, Marge and I have an anniversary coming up."
Homer,These charity address labels that came in the mail.
Homer,I don't wanna go home! I'm not done talking to me!
Homer,Home sweet home. Now to watch some TV.
Homer,Five bucks? I don't need your sharity! I'll dance for my money!
Homer,"I am so wasted. Oh my God, oh my God, we're having a simultaneous pass out!"
Homer,Loveless loners are so lucky. There's no way I can afford to give Marge a nice anniversary present.
Homer,Hm...
Homer,"Hey, I know you. We met in a police lineup."
Homer,"You don't have to tell me, I was number three. Listen, you have any pointers for a newbie?"
Homer,"Coke and Pepsi are the same thing! Wake up, people!"
Homer,"Marge, I'm not gonna lie to you..."
Homer,All the answers you need are in here. Happy anniversary!
Homer,Nope.
Homer,Nope.
Homer,Nope.
Homer,"Close, but no cigar. Just plain diamonds."
Homer,"I heard if you age them for ten years, they turn to liquor."
Homer,"Yeah, you heard your mother."
Homer,MR. BO-JANGLES / MR. BO-JANGLES / WE'RE ALL BO-JANGLES / WHO KILLED BO-JANGLES? / MAYBE IT WAS YOU...
Homer,"Thank you. Thank you. Remember, my dog up and died. Thank you."
Homer,I want to get a second house. Closer to work.
Homer,"But Marge, it was all for you. To buy you all the nice things you deserve. The flowers, the earrings, the Bob Seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice..."
Homer,I don't understand.
Homer,"Hoo boy, are you in trouble."
Homer,"When a woman says nothing's wrong that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off."
Homer,Wait 'til he puts his unsuspecting butt on that toilet seat.
Homer,"Where's the ""ee-yow?"""
Homer,You didn't sit on the toilet!
Homer,"Butt on bowl, little man!"
Homer,It doesn't matter!
Homer,Ee-yow!
Homer,Why you little...!
Homer,"Joke's on me, is it...?"
Homer,It's old lady Simpson! Run!
Homer,Uhh... I'll tell you what's goin' on...
Homer,...I'm taking you all out for pancakes!
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,"Either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks Spanish."
Homer,"Hey, Apu, what's with the line?"
Homer,Pre-nursery school?!
Homer,Are you saying my daughter can't cut it? Just because I owe you fourteen thousand dollars? I'll show you!
Homer,"C'mon, Maggie. You're getting into that school!"
Homer,Which one? Tri-City? Omni-Pay? Insta-Threat? I've beaten 'em all!
Homer,"I'm sorry we wasted your time, your Lordship."
Homer,"Oh, Maggie will do just fine. She'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer..."
Homer,"...Who steals from the till, would ya let me finish? Geez."
Homer,I'm taking you all out for tacos!
Homer,Woo-hoo! I got that one right too!
Homer,"Go, Seminoles!"
Homer,"So our kids keep getting smarter! If we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids."
Homer,"If you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby. I'm slappin' this sucker right over ""Support Our Troops."""
Homer,"Your mother's right, honey. Katie Couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it!"
Homer,That still sounds like the smart kid.
Homer,The school sent this dealy over for Maggie. His name is Phonic Frog.
Homer,That's me. Huh-oh-muh-eh-er!
Homer,I'll be right back.
Homer,"Why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? Why, Santa, why?"
Homer,"Oh, I knew it!"
Homer,"Oh no, the giant is waking up!"
Homer,Hit the red button!
Homer,"I know, we'll use reverse psychology. Maggie, don't press the red button!"
Homer,Damn it!
Homer,"Marge, I've always loved you. Bart, you were a worthy foe."
Homer,"Oh good, she's here in time to see us die!"
Homer,"Well, Marge, you can't say I never take you anywhere."
Homer,"Well, I think we all learned a lesson today: don't try to be something you're not. Namely, food."
Homer,How'd you get in here?
Homer,Zing.
Homer,"That's my baby, jerk."
Homer,The Wild Dingleberries?
Homer,I am so there!
Homer,"How 'bout ""Diet Coke -- the Movie?""... ""President Air Bud: Tail To The Chief?""... ""My Big Fat Greek Salad?"""
Homer,"Ooh, well, I am curious to see if those teens lose their virginity. And the wager only sweetens the deal."
Homer,What Would Jesus View?
Homer,"Okay kids, forget the movie. We'll just go to the furniture store and sit down."
Homer,The Re-deadening? Is that any good?
Homer,"Hey Lenny, is your film appropriate for kids?"
Homer,"Don't ruin it for me! One adult and four children for ""The Re-deadening."""
Homer,"Hey, I paid for this popcorn and I'm eating it."
Homer,"Relax, stupid. Everything you see is make believe. Although it is based on a true story. Some of which happened in this very theater."
Homer,"Oh honey, don't be scared. Look, they killed the evil doll."
Homer,"Well, what do you know? It's unkillable."
Homer,"Honey, can daddy rest his soda on your head?"
Homer,That's my girl.
Homer,But scaring kids is good for them. It hardens them against future terrors -- like roofing and driveway scams.
Homer,Sorry. I forgot I bought the soundtrack album.
Homer,"Who loves ya, baby?"
Homer,Okay. You have the right to remain sexy. Anything you touch can and will be held against you in a court of sex. If you cannot afford a sex-torney--
Homer,"I don't see any ghost. I did find this Newsweek from 1986: ""Why America Loves Saddam Hussein."""
Homer,"That's it. It's one thing for a ghost to terrorize my children, but quite another for him to play my theremin."
Homer,I thought we killed him!
Homer,But I did delete him from my bulk email list.
Homer,Oh yeah. That monkey got America through some tough times.
Homer,No way! He's an annoying sneak who's out to steal my wife.
Homer,"Okay kids, you can keep him."
Homer,"C'mon, little fella. You're hangin' with me tonight."
Homer,"Guys, I'd like you to meet Artie Ziff."
Homer,I'll see your fifty cents and raise you one dollar.
Homer,And the peanuts in your mouth.
Homer,All of them.
Homer,Four jacks.
Homer,Check it out! I own a multi-national corporation. I always knew some day I'd be a C.O.D.
Homer,Investor confidence? Perhaps this affects me -- I own two hundred and thirty million shares of ZiffCorp stock.
Homer,I sure am -- with all the inherent legal liability.
Homer,Don't tell my kids I'm going to jail! Tell them I've joined the Blue Man Group! I'm the fat one!
Homer,Plead the fifth amend-what?
Homer,Refuse to answer on the grounds that I what?
Homer,"Inseminate myself? Dudes, I think this guy's comin' on to me."
Homer,"Your majesty, can I go home now?"
Homer,"I miss you guys so much. The smell of Marge's pork chops... the way you kids kiss my ""owies"" when I go boom... This place has become like a prison to me!"
Homer,"Aw, it's no use, son. By the time I get out of here you'll be grown. TURN AROUND / TURN AROUND / TURN AROUND AND YOU'RE A YOUNG MAN / AND YOU'RE TOO BIG TO CHOKE."
Homer,Can I apply my time toward a future crime?
Homer,"Oh my God! Maggie, you're talking!"
Homer,"Oh Bart, what a man you've become."
Homer,I don't think we've seen the last of Artie Ziff.
Homer,"Man, even I think movie popcorn has gotten too big."
Homer,"Get your own, mooch."
Homer,"Oh, I'm so bored! Maybe I'll clean out my wallet."
Homer,"Hey, my car insurance expired. Quite a while ago."
Homer,"That's it. From now on I'm not looking forward to anything. Oh my God, tomorrow there's a two-for-one sale on piano benches! I can't wait!"
Homer,That was you!?
Homer,"Marge, you destroyed my interest in weather!"
Homer,And I know just where to find him. 742 Evergreen Terrace.
Homer,He's in the house?
Homer,And it's a perfect time... I just got fired again.
Homer,"Marge, are you sure we should go drinking together? I mean, who am I gonna complain about while I'm drinking?"
Homer,"Well yeah, legally. But if we're really best friends, how come we never play hoops?"
Homer,"Hm, all right, we'll go on the winery tour. But you'll have to catch me first!"
Homer,"Ow, my ankles snapped."
Homer,"Ahh, summer in Tuscany."
Homer,"Pleasant aroma, rich full body, well-aged... and the wine's not bad either."
Homer,I drank this much!
Homer,Ooh! Can I have my special cup?
Homer,"Oh honey, I love to hear you laugh."
Homer,Yes you do.
Homer,"Hey, you do a great me, Marge. You gotta show the guys at Moe's."
Homer,"Come on, we'll have a blast. Kids, while we're out, the TV's in charge. Go to bed when it says."
Homer,"Two glasses of wine, Moe."
Homer,"All good points. Sleep tight, my drunken angel."
Homer,Yep. Your mother and I have become a legendary party couple. Like Scott and Zelda Munster!
Homer,"Sorry, Marge -- I gotta break in my ski boots some time."
Homer,No problem. We can still have fun without you drinking.
Homer,"You got it. And when I feel weak, I will draw strength from the Bible."
Homer,Uh-oh. Here comes the gospel according to puke.
Homer,"Don't worry, honey. I don't even know if they serve alcohol at this thing."
Homer,"Ahh, the Germans. You just can't stay mad at 'em."
Homer,You can just nurse it.
Homer,Nurse it! Nurse it!
Homer,"Yes, and you've said that several times now."
Homer,I'm in no condition to drive. Wait -- I shouldn't listen to myself. I'm drunk.
Homer,"Okay, okay. Remember the rules for drinking and driving. Drive slow but not too slow. Drink some cola to keep yourself alert."
Homer,What the?
Homer,"Nice work, cruise control."
Homer,"In a minute, honey."
Homer,"Oh my God! If I get one more D.U.I., they'll take away my license. And what will I leave when I rent rollerblades?"
Homer,"Aw, this is a new low for me."
Homer,"I paid your bail, honey. You're free to go."
Homer,"But you do believe it, right?"
Homer,That's my girl!
Homer,She's not coming anymore.
Homer,"Listen, Moe. I did something really terrible to someone I love."
Homer,"Well, what I did was..."
Homer,Can I have some peanuts?
Homer,"I can't talk to my wife for twenty-eight days? Sir, she is not an alcoholic! You can't put me on hold! I'll put you on hold!"
Homer,I AM A LINEMAN FOR THE COUNTY Your call is important to us. Please continue to hold. AND I DRIVE THE MAIN ROAD There are... eight... calls ahead of you. AND THE WICHITA LINEMAN IS STILL ON THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LINE!
Homer,"Lisa, Lisa, your suspicions are important to me and will be answered in the order received. MacARTHUR PARK IS MELTING IN THE DARK / ALL THAT SWEET GREEN ICING ROLLING DOWN / SOMEONE LEFT MY CAKE OUT IN THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI- LI... LI... LI... LI..."
Homer,"Flanders, can you watch my kids while I'm at the rehab clinic?"
Homer,My demons and I are closer than ever. Next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park. I'm just goin' in to bust Marge out.
Homer,Feed my pets and tape my shows!
Homer,I'm here to deliver a package to Marge Simpson.
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"I have an awful confession to make: you didn't crash that car, it was me. I put you behind the wheel and I'm so, so, so sorry."
Homer,"Marge, I did it out of love. Love of not being arrested. But I realize now that nothing is more important than you."
Homer,That woman means the world to me. Would it be all right if I read from my Bible?
Homer,"No wonder they call it ""the good book."""
Homer,"Aw, shut up, Captain Bringdown."
Homer,"Okay, Marge. For you I'll give up rum-based cocktails. Except mojitos and rum and coke."
Homer,"All right. For you, I will give up all clear liquors."
Homer,"Hey, I only drink that when I'm already drunk."
Homer,"Hey, anything's possible. With a little help from my Bible."
Homer,"Oh no! It's a real one! Noooooo! Why God, why?"
Homer,Where are your clothes for the gentleman who's big and fat?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,So many shoppers. Ow! Damn this... ow! Resilient economy.
Homer,Dressing room? Uh oh.
Homer,Is it Lenny?
Homer,"It's not all your fault. All these years, I watched you turn our son into a time bomb, and yet I did nothing. So in a way, I too am a victim... of you."
Homer,"Oh, I get it. Blame the strangler."
Homer,My poor boy is miserable in here. There has to be something I can do to help him.
Homer,"Interesting. Marge, what does that sign say?"
Homer,I believe that children are the future -- unless we stop them now.
Homer,Uh-huh. When does training start?
Homer,Put that sissy down!
Homer,"If you're gonna pick on someone, why don't you pick on someone much bigger than you with a gun?"
Homer,That's right. I got a job here so I can watch over you like a mother hen.
Homer,"I sure am. Here you go, son. I brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge."
Homer,"Well, that's the end of my shift."
Homer,"See you Monday. Oh wait, Monday's Martin Luther King Day. I'll see ya when I see ya."
Homer,Love you.
Homer,You just don't understand boys. He's stupid.
Homer,"Relax, what's the worst that could happen?"
Homer,No son of mine will be marched down the aisle at the barrel of a ray gun.
Homer,Let's go.
Homer,"Son, I want you to know, no matter what anyone says, there's no shame in being caught alive."
Homer,"Gina, thanks for showing us the meaning of Christmas."
Homer,"I'm changing the batteries in all the remotes. We're all out of triple A's, so I'm gonna whittle down a couple of these D's."
Homer,She sure loves that couch.
Homer,"Come on, it's your last night of freedom. You gotta have some fun."
Homer,"Hey, take it easy on Skinner. He's just down 'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong."
Homer,"What are you trying to tell me, Skinner?"
Homer,Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
Homer,"Marge, guess what! Skinner wants to bail on his wedding!"
Homer,"Oh man, is this awkward. I'm outta here."
Homer,"Yeah Marge, it looks like you got the last perfect man. Oh uh, by the way... can I borrow your car tomorrow? Mine's acting up."
Homer,"Hey, you're the one always bugging me to screw up our marriage."
Homer,"Whatever. The important thing is to get Skinner to that altar. Because once a union has been sanctified by God, it takes at least six months to tear it apart."
Homer,"Right, naked Duffman?"
Homer,"Don't worry, I've got a man on the perimeter."
Homer,This is Fat Load. I'd like to request a new codename.
Homer,"Okay, Fat Load here."
Homer,Hey champ. Ready to take the plunge?
Homer,"Yeah, he's crazy all right."
Homer,Unkink the hose!
Homer,Wait a minute. I thought you didn't wanna get married.
Homer,"Don't worry, Principal Skinner."
Homer,"Really? Boy, it sucks to be you. Anyhoo, if there's one thing I know, it's how to win back a furious woman. We'll go to her house, and I'll whisper to you exactly what to say."
Homer,"Hey, if we get your girlfriend back I won't have to."
Homer,"Okay, just repeat after me. ""Edna, I made a huge mistake and I want you back."""
Homer,Marge? Are you helping her?
Homer,Which are you saying is dead? Our marriage or our batteries?
Homer,Shut up! I didn't tell you to say that!
Homer,Because I'm successfully married.
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Why did I take it off? Oh, right. To see if I could skip it across Lake Michigan."
Homer,"String quartet, are you tuned up?"
Homer,And the castrati?
Homer,And a one and a two and a...
Homer,Give her back to Skinner! A fat bald guy like you... you could have anyone!
Homer,"Okay, we'll go to the convention, sell my Lois Lane comics, buy some Jimmy Olsens, and stop Edna from making a terrible mistake!"
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. We'll get something to eat."
Homer,I don't see Skinner anywhere.
Homer,That room has a dry erase board. They could be doing anything in there! Anything.
Homer,"Okay Marge, I hear ya. Now that Krabappel has made her decision, it's time to whitewash over our problems."
Homer,"Marge, the greatest day of my life was the day you and I became one."
Homer,Would you marry me again?
Homer,"And now, Padre, if you would do the honors."
Homer,"Marge, you just agreed to raise the kids Klingon!"
Homer,"Okay, don't go. Just stay here and rot with Grampa."
Homer,I'll right-side you!
Homer,I say you don't exist!
Homer,Can I have both?
Homer,"Son, seeing sappy movies with a lady has certain ""payoffs."""
Homer,Exactly.
Homer,WHERE DO I BEGIN? TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW GREAT A LOVE CAN BE...
Homer,THE SIMPLE SOMETHING THAT DUM DEEDLE DUM DEE DEE... / NOW LET'S PUSH PLAAAY!
Homer,"Yeah, we're tryin' to create a mood here, so shut the Hell up!"
Homer,"Eh, well, I wouldn't be happy."
Homer,"So, um, you're not in the mood anymore, are you?"
Homer,We're alone now.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"What kind of an airline routes all their flights through Nome, Alaska?"
Homer,Here's your future!
Homer,Remember our honeymoon?
Homer,"Marge, let's do it."
Homer,We get one weekend to ourselves and we've gotta spend it watching some old geezer's odometer turn over? As the Bible says: screw that!
Homer,"We don't have boarding passes, but we need to get on that plane for reasons that are utterly insane."
Homer,There's a first class?
Homer,"And look at me, I'm reading ""The Economist."" Did you know Indonesia is at a crossroads?"
Homer,It is.
Homer,"Boy, it's great being here without those children of yours."
Homer,"And tonight, we'll finally, and romantically, hump."
Homer,You keep thinking that!
Homer,COME ON EVERYBODY HAVE SOME SEX-UAL CONGRESS / NOT THE KIND OF CONGRESS THAT CONTAINED PAUL TSONGAS...
Homer,"Marge, I won't let that happen. We have to grab this chance for romance now, or we'll never be alone. Not 'til Lisa's in college and we've lost contact with Bart."
Homer,I've got a card that can take us anywhere in the world!
Homer,Noooo!
Homer,"Oh yeah, like people in New Jersey have never seen a fat man makin' out. It's on the freakin' state flag."
Homer,Occupied!
Homer,"At last, we're alone..."
Homer,"Oh, right."
Homer,"And now, my darling, it's finally time for romance. But before the intercourse, the dinner course."
Homer,"All I wanted was a second honeymoon, and now the floor is made of lava."
Homer,"I knew if we got up early enough, we could sneak away from Bart and Lisa. Kids don't beat me, I beat kids."
Homer,You monsters! You followed us!
Homer,Never!
Homer,This way!
Homer,Quick -- we can hide in here!
Homer,"Because I was saving that for my birthday. Now, c'mon!"
Homer,This must be what it's like to be in space.
Homer,"And yet, I've never been to me."
Homer,That sliding should stop soon.
Homer,This rolling is just temporary.
Homer,"Ah, that's better. So why do they call this place Niagara Falls anyway?"
Homer,"Marge, I guess we'll just have to make love in Heaven. I'll bet it always works up there."
Homer,"Oh, you're on my hair. Oh, that's better."
Homer,No one does that to my daughter!
Homer,"Quiet, the commercial's on! If we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing TV."
Homer,Do I ever!
Homer,Would I!
Homer,I'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! The only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!
Homer,Nope. Just lookin' for that golden ticket.
Homer,"Nope, nothing, nope, nada, the golden ticket! At long last."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Judge a pig competition?... But I'm no super-genius! Or are I?
Homer,"Hey, I know that country!"
Homer,USA! USA!
Homer,Comely... succulent... clearly had a snout job...
Homer,"Ugh, too eighties."
Homer,But I've gotta do something! I'll need a disguise.
Homer,Hold it right there!
Homer,You've hurt your last feeling!
Homer,"Oh, I have a funny feeling we will. Wherever people are mistreated, the Pie Man will strike!"
Homer,"Whatcha doin', sweetie?"
Homer,"That's really sweet, honey."
Homer,"Aw, hey, let's turn that frown upside down."
Homer,"What's wrong, son?"
Homer,"Somebody ought to take him down a peg. Or, should I say, down a pie."
Homer,"Maybe you're right, Lisa. Maybe you're pie. Pie-be you're pie."
Homer,Comic Book Guy! Don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime!
Homer,"Oh, I think you'd find his filling extremely hot."
Homer,Flanders!? He's not man enough to trim my crust. I mean Pie Man's crust. I'm not Pie Man.
Homer,This is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!
Homer,"Not so fast, old-time liberal."
Homer,"No trap can hold Homer Simpson! But I'm not Homer Simpson. I'm the Pie Man. Homer Simpson away! I mean, the Pie Man!"
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,"Let's see...cartilage, cartilage, muscle, nerve!... artery...bullet."
Homer,"Pie Man is not your father, little girl. I... murdered your father."
Homer,We shall continue this conversation in the pie cave.
Homer,"Watch it, one more step. Welcome to my secret lair."
Homer,"So it would seem. Anyhoo, I'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise, huh? Mild-mannered Homer Simpson..."
Homer,Honorable men can differ. Now what brings you down here?
Homer,"All right, I'll stop. But what'll I do with these pies?"
Homer,"I was in so deep, I forgot pies were food."
Homer,I'll show him.
Homer,"No, I shouldn't."
Homer,Or should I?
Homer,"I'll keep my promise, honey."
Homer,Since when do I listen to cakes?
Homer,You're all so wise... I wish I could eat each and every one of you.
Homer,I've run out of pie-related puns!
Homer,"It's not a rubber band, it's a scrunchie!"
Homer,I already work for you.
Homer,Do I get two paychecks?
Homer,But I promised my daughter--
Homer,Nooo! Not community service -- I can't stand helping others! I just can't!
Homer,"No, not him! Anyone but him! I've had my problems with him. Everyone has. But like every monster, he just wants to be loved."
Homer,I can't sleep. I keep thinking about the Pie Man.
Homer,"What if he started pieing good people? Not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?"
Homer,"No, I'm not. And here's a picture that proves it."
Homer,See...
Homer,You know I'm not Pie Man.
Homer,"Oh come on, she's a little girl."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,The Dalai Lama!
Homer,I can't do this in front of Lisa. Why does she have to believe in things?
Homer,"Please forgive me, talking llama."
Homer,No. I won't. There's only one way I can escape from this nightmare.
Homer,"I'm telling you, I'm the Pie Man!"
Homer,"Yeah. Let's go home, honey."
Homer,Was it the kiss?
Homer,"Wherever injustice shows its ugly face, I will be there! For I am the Pie Man!"
Homer,Homer drunk... but how? Hmmm...
Homer,"Eww! I kissed that sad, weird kid!"
Homer,My beer! You never had a chance to become my urine! Why you little...
Homer,"Mr. Simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?"
Homer,Permission to treat this witness as hostile.
Homer,"Actually, Marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you."
Homer,"It was years ago, when I was ten. Back in the '60s, or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s..."
Homer,I thought we were gonna play fun games at camp.
Homer,I couldn't believe my eye.
Homer,"She was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. Uh... until I met your mother, who made that girl look like a Godzilla made of garbage."
Homer,"Oh, this is so confusing. I'd like a brief recess."
Homer,Whee! Recess!
Homer,Why? Because I only kissed one girl in my whole life? That's still one more than you.
Homer,I'm so lame!
Homer,"Well, that stinks. But I still get to kiss you, right?"
Homer,"Think, Homer, think."
Homer,I'm Elvis. Elvis Jagger. Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar.
Homer,There goes a good friend.
Homer,It was pretty delicious.
Homer,It felt like a cluster bomb wiping out a graveyard full of zombies.
Homer,Whuh-oh.
Homer,"She sure did. Now if Lisa is finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up..."
Homer,We had just finished our first smooch. And I felt a feeling I'd never felt before:
Homer,Kids love trains.
Homer,"Hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?"
Homer,She wouldn't do that -- we shared something special.
Homer,No.
Homer,I just blew my first chance at true love.
Homer,"And now that my special girl has heard the truth, I know she'll forgive me."
Homer,"Earth to special girl? You forgive me, right?"
Homer,What about now?
Homer,What about now?
Homer,What about now?
Homer,What about now?
Homer,"Marge, I'm really sorry I hurt you. But I've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun I hid from you, the time I sued the church, ruining Lisa's wedding in the future... remember that?"
Homer,That's not true! I thought about that girl every day of my life... until I met you.
Homer,All right. This is my memory box. I haven't opened it in thirty years.
Homer,"Ooh, a letter from my old pen pal. Someday I'll write you back, Osama. Ah, here's what I'm lookin' for."
Homer,I sure did. I kept it right next to my IBM stock... king.
Homer,Because somehow you realized I was a good guy after all?
Homer,"Oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be Marge."
Homer,Here you go.
Homer,Don't forget Maggie!
Homer,Doctor! Perform a diagnosis!
Homer,Cool!
Homer,"Bart, pass the ketchup. Bart, pass the ketchup!"
Homer,"Oh, sorry, right."
Homer,"Bart, pass the corn. Bart, pass the corn!"
Homer,Everybody remember that for when his hearing comes back.
Homer,To date!
Homer,No one calls me unpatriotic.
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Hey, guys."
Homer,"Oh, cold shoulder, huh? Well, I'll just talk to myself. Hey, how ya doin', Homer? Oh, not too bad, how about you? Oh I'm fine. Your wife was great in bed last night. You keep your hands off my wife! Oh yeah? Well I give her what she needs. And she likes..."
Homer,"Oh, Homer, stop it!"
Homer,Even my best friends have left me! I'm all alone!
Homer,Y'ello. Appear on your TV show?! Tell our side of the story?! You'll see us there?! Goodbye?! Dial tone?!
Homer,"No, no, no, let her finish."
Homer,"Son, I've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. Don't rock the boat. Don't even get in the boat."
Homer,"Just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier. But don't go in the bathrooms, they're filthy."
Homer,"Talk about boats! Then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you don't."
Homer,"There there, save your lies for the American public."
Homer,What'd you say?
Homer,BUY ME SOME PEANUTS AND CRACKERJACK... / I DON'T CARE IF... OW!
Homer,Do you get time off for snitching on your cellmates?
Homer,Bill Clinton? What are you doin' here?
Homer,"Yeah, yeah. Next commercial."
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,I don't want to be in any stupid talent show. Not without my Tennessee walking horses.
Homer,"Now, people have accused this family of not loving our country. But you can't spell U.S.A. without us... eh?"
Homer,FIFTY STARS AND THIRTEEN STRIPES...
Homer,TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY IS NO CHORE...
Homer,"We mean it, don't move."
Homer,"OKAY, KIDS SHOW OFF YOUR PIPES..."
Homer,"Because if they catch us, we may have to do it again. And this time I want it tight!"
Homer,What genius put a prison on the middle of an island?
Homer,Yes.
Homer,"Great, dive in."
Homer,I'm not made of money! We'll swim to Oakland.
Homer,"Oh, what's the use? Even if they pick us up, we'll go back to jail 'cause they think we hate America. I don't want to end up like Elmo, hanging himself in prison."
Homer,And here no one calls me a fat jerk... I'm a gourmand!
Homer,"No, Marge, there's one group that's always welcome in America: immigrants without I.D."
Homer,"Well, kids, this is the first chapter of our brand new lives... in America."
Homer,Simpson.
Homer,"Ooh, that'll save some time."
Homer,"Now, kids, it'll take us a while to assimilate. I'll start out as a cop, and then, with time, become a dirty cop."
Homer,Bart! You promised you'd stop making that comparison.
Homer,Per... our... agreement!
Homer,"If that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. We'll lose tourists! And then who will buy my roadside corn?"
Homer,"There's a lot you don't know about me, Marge. A lot that would shock you."
Homer,Now to do something I've never done before -- help out an old man.
Homer,"Here's a poem: ""run fast, or lose your ass""!"
Homer,"Bart, you're grounded for a year."
Homer,"Okay, three bucks."
Homer,Or that lady who wheels Larry Flynt around!
Homer,"I'm always happy to help you, sweetie."
Homer,He TOSSES a paper and yells out the window.
Homer,Extree! Extree! Man driving erratically throws papers out window!
Homer,"Boy, I can't wait to dance on his grave."
Homer,Stupid women drivers.
Homer,Stupid women helicopter pilots.
Homer,Everyone okay?
Homer,These batteries have to power everything in our house!
Homer,"YO, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT, WHAT I REALLY REALLY WANT... WHAT I WANT WHAT I WANT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I..."
Homer,That was totally worth it.
Homer,"Oh yeah, she's always trying to improve mankind."
Homer,Wait a minute. Are you trying to get dirt on Lisa?
Homer,"Well, if that's your custom."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Well, she's into Buddhism, whistle-blowing, totally against pollution no matter what I say..."
Homer,"Well, that loser Milhouse has always had a thing for her. Don't you love it when nerds don't know they're nerds?"
Homer,"I'm so sorry, honey. I said good things about you too. Check out the Lifestyle section: ""Plastic pearls make the girl."""
Homer,"Oh, I can't stand seeing one of my children like this."
Homer,I can still hear her. I'd better do something.
Homer,"Marge, I'm pullin' an all-nighter for my little girl. Put on a pot of coffee, drink it and start makin' burgers."
Homer,"""All my daughter ever did was tell people to think for themselves. I may be her father, but when I grow up, I wanna be just like her. Except still a dude."""
Homer,"See, Lisa? Instead of one Big Shot controlling all the media, now there's a thousand freaks Xeroxing their worthless opinions."
Homer,You're the only one who won't shut up about it.
Homer,Trying to get a Frisbee off the roof.
Homer,"Oh, there's the Frisbee."
Homer,"And while you're there, can you get my Frisbee off the ledge?"
Homer,"Hey Flanders, have you seen my Frisbee?"
Homer,"People's deaths, eh?"
Homer,Do me! Do me!
Homer,"So, what'd I die of? Too much happiness? Naked girl avalanche?"
Homer,What kind of bread?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Flanders? Kill me? You never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?
Homer,"Hey Chief, throw me your piece."
Homer,"C'mon, shoot me a new one!"
Homer,"Oh, I'm so scared. Ned Flanders is pointing a gun at me. You couldn't even shoot me by accident, even if I whacked the barrel like this."
Homer,Never!
Homer,"Fine, I'll never go back. Starting tomorrow. Today is Lenny's birthday and they're having ice cream cake."
Homer,But ice cream cake...
Homer,It sure is taking me a long time to reach this button.
Homer,Everything's comin' up Homer.
Homer,"Hmmm, I wonder if I could blow up Heaven?"
Homer,Cool. You guys got a good buffet up here?
Homer,You're not the boss of me.
Homer,"Please spare me. I'm not a murderer, I'm not. And I've never known the pleasures of a woman... or a proper eating apple!"
Homer,"Shrink ray? Oh, there's always something else to buy."
Homer,"Hold on, Maggie! Daddy's coming!"
Homer,I've got her!
Homer,"Oh, Mag... No wait, this is yours."
Homer,Captain!
Homer,"Screw you, doc! I fly from the gut."
Homer,"Bah! Has science ever kissed a woman, or won the Super Bowl, or put a man on the moon? This is what I think of your precious science."
Homer,"Help me, science!"
Homer,"Marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage."
Homer,Maybe this'll help.
Homer,There's a whole rack of 'em over there. I only ate two.
Homer,"And to make sure we get there super fast, I'm hitting all the buttons with my palm."
Homer,"We'll have to lighten the ship, which means one of us has to stay behind. Bart?... Lisa?..."
Homer,"Fine, me."
Homer,"I'm saying goodbye to everything I ever loved. Ooh, a marshmallow!"
Homer,"Boy, when God closes a door, he opens a window."
Homer,I say when we're full. You don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside.
Homer,I need a mouth hole. And some other holes too.
Homer,I'VE GOT YOU DEEP IN THE HEART OF ME...
Homer,"You know, Black Dracula is now a Congressman from Virginia."
Homer,"Marge, I don't want to buy this house. I'd have to live next door to myself."
Homer,Turn that down!
Homer,"Oh c'mon, Marge. It's not fair to compare us to an American household."
Homer,A slightly colder fridge? In my lifetime? Amazing.
Homer,And check this out.
Homer,"A walk-in microwave! Hey Marge, can you press stop when my popcorn's done?"
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,And I kept that vow.
Homer,"I'll build you a new kitchen, sweetie."
Homer,"A contractor? Those guys are the biggest crooks around. They charge for materials and labor! Pick one, jerks!"
Homer,"Man, that hurt. And now to do the exact same thing again."
Homer,All right.
Homer,Fine.
Homer,Easy... easy...
Homer,Trying to.
Homer,But I need them for the articles!
Homer,"Of course not. Why would I want to look at a nude woman I'm not even married to? I mean, I wouldn't even know how she could improve me."
Homer,"Steady, steady..."
Homer,"Thanks, Marge. I can't wait to read about ""Sport Fishing With Sonny Jurgensen."""
Homer,What man would want you now?
Homer,"There it is, nice and smooth. I'd like to see your boyfriend the contractor do a better job."
Homer,"Oh, now you tell me."
Homer,So that's what that white noise was.
Homer,"Get lost, crook!"
Homer,Why don't you just kiss her?
Homer,How 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars.
Homer,I was thinking of chicken wings.
Homer,Those are good too.
Homer,Your mother's about to show us her new recipe.
Homer,"Marge, I don't want to freak you out, but I think I love you."
Homer,"I'm proud of you, honey."
Homer,Adult themes? What are you talking about?
Homer,Stupid Bart. Bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.
Homer,"Hey sweetie, is Mom winning?"
Homer,But she'll still win the contest?
Homer,But win the contest?
Homer,"Woo-hoo! If Marge becomes Auntie Ovenfresh, we'll meet all the food personalities..."
Homer,"Look! It's Mister Cashew... the Koobler Dwarfs... Snip, Crinkle and Poof..."
Homer,"Twinkle the Kidd, I love you!"
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Blood for creme! Blood for creme!
Homer,"Would you excuse us, Milton?"
Homer,"Yeah, and your father's ""No House."" Now scram."
Homer,"Maybe I was a little hard on him. Oh, well. Bart, I know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. But what's going on up here?"
Homer,"Uh-um... What do you think ""some"" is?"
Homer,"I thought I'd never have to do this, but it's time to tell you the facts of life."
Homer,Do you know what a boob is?
Homer,Good. That'll save us some time. Okay... why do you think your mother and I sleep in the same bed?
Homer,Exactly. And we're poor because we have kids. And the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is...
Homer,"Well, it's better they hear it from me now, than from their parents when they're old enough."
Homer,"And Marge, you'll always be the best chef in our house."
Homer,"Hey, it keeps the kids quiet."
Homer,"That's ridiculous, honey. You're the cutest little girl I know. You just have what is known as the Simpson butt. Permit me to elaborate."
Homer,"Every Simpson starts with a circle. Daddy has one big circle here... then a smaller one up here... two big, sexy circles for eyes... one macho muzzle... and a snappy new outfit. Hm, I'm lookin' good... ooh, cuffs... yeah... and for some reason, my hair and ear form an ""M"" and a ""G."""
Homer,"You wanna know a little trick? To downsize my derrière, I just tie a sweater around it."
Homer,See?
Homer,"Oh, Homer, you're wasting away to nothing. You simply must eat something. Well, you're the boss!"
Homer,"Oh, I love to see my man eat."
Homer,"Nice try, loser. I bet you made up a fake test."
Homer,All right.
Homer,"Ah-ha! Here's a mistake. It says the capital of Kentucky is Frankfort. Dream on, pal."
Homer,Really? Frankfurter... is that anything?
Homer,"All right, boy, which con did you work here? Copy off another kid? Pay attention and take notes? Well, take note of this!"
Homer,I thought you two broke up.
Homer,"Oh, what's the big deal? Bart didn't like his presents. So what? It's not like he gives us such great gifts. Remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? What was that? That was crap."
Homer,"So they're growing up. Soon they'll be leaving the nest, and you'll have time for yourself. Hundreds of thousands of hours. And then, the peace of the grave."
Homer,Open.
Homer,"Well, that explains a lot. Who's hungry?"
Homer,They're a family again. And so are we. What happened?
Homer,"And Lisa, what have you learned?"
Homer,"But talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?"
Homer,"C'mon, say something conclusive."
Homer,"Open-ended! C'mon, Lisa. Say everything's fine. Everything's fine."
Homer,Prove it.
Homer,Woo hoo! Free cheese!
Homer,"What's happened to us, Marge? We used to feed each other cheese and laugh all night. Then came the heart attacks."
Homer,Woo hoo! The circus!
Homer,Woo hoo! I don't know the difference!
Homer,What about that two-headed goat?
Homer,"Yes, but he came here to die."
Homer,"One of you ate tin cans, one of you ate health food. How you solved crimes I'll never know."
Homer,"Marge! I figured out a way we can get in on this Quimby lawsuit! Bart, go ahead."
Homer,Huh? Huh?
Homer,I sawed you on the television.
Homer,I believe it was the school's tuba.
Homer,"Chloe, these kebabs you made are as good or better than anything I've ever had at this table."
Homer,"Oh Marge, I'm just being polite."
Homer,More!
Homer,"Oh come on, Marge. The only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet."
Homer,I'm here! I'm here! Quit buggin' me!
Homer,It's a conversation starter!
Homer,I swallowed a chicken bone.
Homer,Same one.
Homer,"Good news, Marge!"
Homer,I've learned to walk naked on stilts!
Homer,"Oh Honey, her life can't compare to yours. You've got three kids, a TV tray from Expo sixty-seven, and you're married to King Stink!"
Homer,"Marge, listen to me. Chloe may have a flashy job, but you're the backbone of this family. You're like the electrical tape that holds the two halves of my car together."
Homer,"I just hate to see you upset, honey. You know what would be a good name for Maggie? Chloe."
Homer,Ladies! There's no need to fight over me.
Homer,"Oh. Well then, carry on."
Homer,"All right. But while I'm gone, boy, you think about what you did."
Homer,You uh...
Homer,"Why you little... need a reason for strangling, do ya... I'll fix your wagon!"
Homer,And I'm growing ashamed of my penis.
Homer,"Marge, that's crazy talk. Now look, I'll save Lisa. Your place is here with the women."
Homer,"Okay, you go save Lisa. I'll stay here with the women."
Homer,What do women want?!
Homer,"Okay. I'll run as fast as I can, but I'm full of potato salad."
Homer,"Chief, my daughter's up there. You're a father too."
Homer,Pretend to care!
Homer,Whew!
Homer,I wouldn't say that.
Homer,"Oh yes you are. Why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle."
Homer,"Yeah, that's how it starts."
Homer,"Bart's shirt is a classic, Marge. Just like ""Keep On Truckin'"". As if I would ever want to stop truckin'."
Homer,"I've been reading this magazine for years, but I never dreamed my son would be on the cover."
Homer,You broke in!
Homer,Yeah. Nothing makes parents happier than when an eccentric single man takes an interest in their child.
Homer,Look at all that cash.
Homer,"You know what, Mr. Burns? I'm never comin' back. My son's making so much cash in the T-shirt game, that I don't have to work another day in my life -- assuming my health does not deteriorate as I age."
Homer,"Bart, can I ask you an important question?"
Homer,Twenty-nine ninety-nine.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Lenny, Carl! How ya doin'?"
Homer,It's awesome. You know what I've gotten into? Sleeping 'til noon.
Homer,"Hey, just 'cause I'm not working doesn't mean I can't gripe like you guys. Don't you hate it when people steal your lunch out of the break-room fridge?"
Homer,"Oh, I see what's goin' on. You can't stand to be around a guy who's got total financial independence."
Homer,"No problem. Bart, I need two hundred dollars."
Homer,I broke some bathroom fixtures.
Homer,"I'm pathetic? Because I take money from my ten-year-old son? Well, let me tell you something: I still call the shots around here!"
Homer,I don't have an inside voice!
Homer,The couch is like that tree!
Homer,"Lisa, basic cable said I should nurture you."
Homer,"Okay! You be the girl, and I'll be the car."
Homer,"Screw the market, we're going to Mexico!"
Homer,It's El Flanderito! Run him down!
Homer,"Hey, what's that dealy?"
Homer,"Oh, you'll win for sure. You and science go together like Lenny and Carl. The science is Carl."
Homer,"Honey, all you need's a little help from your dad. Remember, I did used to work at a science factory."
Homer,"Sweetie, that's orphan talk."
Homer,Stupid atomic pile. How hard could it be to build a reactor? Korea did it. And look at the quality of their animation.
Homer,"Hey, maybe the internet has the information I need! It certainly answered a lot of my questions about wang enhancement."
Homer,www.nuclear-secrets.com.
Homer,"Are you a terrorist? No. ""Would you like to meet someone special but are tired of the bar scene?"" No. I will never tire of the bar scene!"
Homer,"Let's see, I can make that... you can get that by smashing open a golf ball... that you can find in any player piano..."
Homer,All I need is some plutonium and I know just the place to get it.
Homer,"Up-bup-bup-bup-bup, don't look!"
Homer,"Sweetie, your Daddy's gonna show you just how much he loves you. You know that non-functioning nuclear reactor you built?"
Homer,I juiced it up a little.
Homer,"Oh, that's madiculous."
Homer,I never complain about your frilly pillows.
Homer,"What's the matter, boy?"
Homer,"Son, when you grew up, I grew down. But now I can see you need your Dad more than ever."
Homer,"Get back in the garage, old man."
Homer,Stay out of my boxes!
Homer,"You give my son what he deserves, or I'll knock you on your delightfully offbeat ass!"
Homer,"Sir, this is a class two plutonium fission reactor. If I turn this dial..."
Homer,"The resulting blast would destroy the entire tri-city area, including that guy who sells those Blu-Blocker sunglasses people sometimes wear."
Homer,Damn him to hell.
Homer,Are you prepared to take that chance?
Homer,"Not so fast. I also want some dribble glasses, fake boobs, two of Bart's T-shirts, and that rapping toilet seat."
Homer,"Yo, yo, yo! Keep it on the low flow!"
Homer,I'm hangin' this over the mantel.
Homer,"Well, I'm just glad we're back to me being the father and you being the son."
Homer,"Oh, I doubt it. But we'll let the seagulls at the dump figure it out."
Homer,Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!
Homer,Re-straint! Re-straint! Re-straint!
Homer,"Lighten up, Marge. This is my chance to relax with people from work I never get to see. Like this guy."
Homer,Really? How'm I doin'?
Homer,"Nice tux, Moe."
Homer,"Hey, it's a guy in a goofy Burns head!"
Homer,Act like Burns!
Homer,That's him to a T!
Homer,"Wow, a wooden plane. It's about time trees were good for something, instead of just standing there like jerks."
Homer,What a magical party this has been. Mr. Burns is a great man.
Homer,"C'mon, Marge. This place is great. Free admission, great grub and we got to use the bathroom of the future."
Homer,"Spill it, Super-boss!"
Homer,"I'll get a second job. One that pays well. You think those guys on ""Friends"" need another friend?"
Homer,"Dammit! I would've been perfect as Rachel's Irish cousin. So you're all doing each other, are ya? Well, who's going to put out for old Seamus?"
Homer,I need a new job that provides full health benefits.
Homer,Phobos? That's a good job for me.
Homer,I declare that you have the most beautiful brown eyes.
Homer,Dad?
Homer,"The border, eh? Then I'd better sand off my fingerprints."
Homer,"I could just wear gloves. Nah, they're upstairs."
Homer,"Hola, Señor. We are gringos who wish to spend mucho dinero in your country."
Homer,Drugs! Various drugs! Be sure to read instructions! Uh-oh! Where'd I put the instructions?
Homer,Marge? Bart? Lisa?
Homer,"Wow, this is just like Hawaii, but you don't get beaten up if you leave the hotel. What gives?"
Homer,"Oh man, I need something to settle my stomach."
Homer,Oh wait. I was supposed to take these with food.
Homer,"Why the sweet talk, Apu? Are you after some cheap drugs?"
Homer,"Flanders? I don't know... I mean, you haven't done anything for me since you lent me that five thousand bucks yesterday."
Homer,Hold on. We're just innocent tourists.
Homer,No cameras?
Homer,"Listen you two, I'll tell you who the true God is if you're both quiet the rest of the trip!"
Homer,"All right, I'm comin' back there."
Homer,My butt looks so huge during perp walks.
Homer,"Dad, you tried your best. For the first time in my life I can say, without being drunk, that I truly admire you."
Homer,There are other ways to get into Canada...
Homer,"That's it, a plane!"
Homer,Sure it will. All we need is a pilot!
Homer,Katharine Hepburn?!
Homer,"We really appreciate your help, Johnny. Is there any way we can repay ya?"
Homer,Really? In America we do it four times a week. You come on down and I'll get us front row seats.
Homer,Don't dump me out! I can lose weight! Just give me a chance.
Homer,"One... two... Eh, I'd rather die."
Homer,"Well, at least we're all in this together."
Homer,"We'll make it, Dad. On a wing and a prayer."
Homer,Dammit.
Homer,"Great news, honey! Burns made me a freelance consultant!"
Homer,"Hey, what's this lump?"
Homer,"See you in Hell, document!"
Homer,"Now remember to eat smart, people. Go for the fancy foods -- don't let 'em fill you up with THAT cheap stuff."
Homer,Screw you.
Homer,Smoked salmon... Shrimp... Crab legs!
Homer,I win...
Homer,"I've never been so embarrassed. And the worst part is, this is brunch so you've ruined two meals! I'll see you all at lupper!"
Homer,"Why did I ever have kids? I could have written symphonies, or been Shakespeare."
Homer,"Oh, who are you, the health inspector?"
Homer,"Moe's, a tribute. ""M"" is for Moe, the owner of Moe's. ""O"" is for the ""O"" in the middle of Moe's. ""E"" is for acceptance. The feeling I always got here at Moe's. Oh Moe, don't let 'em close you down!"
Homer,"I can't go to a gay bar, I'm too fat! Moe, I'm gonna help you reopen your bar no matter what it takes."
Homer,... Marge?
Homer,Put up my house? But I just paid it off... what would Marge say?
Homer,"Okay honey, I'll do it."
Homer,That was me.
Homer,Marge! How dare you open a letter addressed to both of us?
Homer,I had to! Or Moe's would stay closed forever!
Homer,"Look, look. I can see you're upset. If you need me, I'll be at Moe's."
Homer,"Marge, you can't go with me to Moe's. I mean, how would you like it if I came with you to your mother's?"
Homer,That's because I hate her.
Homer,Just made it!
Homer,"Boy, I can't wait to get my lips around an ice cold..."
Homer,"But I don't wanna take care of the kids... Um... how many cigars are they allowed to have? Bart sleeps in the microwave, right?"
Homer,"How many magic beans should I sell the baby for? Three? Duh, der, duh. That's me, jerk-ass Homer. Duh, der, doy."
Homer,Just what are you inferring?
Homer,"Whew, that's a relief!"
Homer,"Ah yes, Detroit-style. Very nice. So, you've been at Moe's every night this week."
Homer,Bonded?! How many times?
Homer,"Thanks, honey. My mind is completely at ease."
Homer,"Well, I might as well use this pucker for something."
Homer,"Oh Marge, don't you love it when our hands meet in the popcorn tub?"
Homer,Hey Moe... haven't seen you in a while.
Homer,How do you know about that?
Homer,You do?
Homer,"Well... I'm worried about Marge and Moe. They've developed an intimate bond of thoughts and feelings completely separate from me. But it's not physical. So everything's great, right?"
Homer,Can I learn it at a happy place?
Homer,What do I do?
Homer,You're absolutely right! Stop this ride!
Homer,"Marge, my darling! Thank God you're home! I've been dying to hear your feelings!"
Homer,"Well, I can go all night, baby. I could listen to you two, maybe three, times."
Homer,Catch your flight?
Homer,What's a cuckold?
Homer,He's only your emotional uncle! I'm your real uncle!
Homer,I'm off!
Homer,"Hang on, Marge, Homie's comin'! I won't let that man make you happy!"
Homer,But I have to get to the airport to save my marriage!
Homer,"You gotta get me closer, Chief!"
Homer,Marge!
Homer,Toilet hole.
Homer,You leave my wife alone!
Homer,Uh... ice?
Homer,"Oh, it's true. I don't know Marge at all. I'll just go home now."
Homer,"Moe, you've won. I'll see you at baggage claim."
Homer,"Marge, I just wanna say: if you ever feel like cheating on Moe, here's my card."
Homer,And you're my Margie-wargie-bargie-fargie-gargie-margie-targie-glargie.
Homer,"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I chew in my sleep."
Homer,THINK OF ME BABE WHENEVER / SOME SWEET TALKING GUY IN A THONG / HANDS YOU A BONG / DON'T TAKE...
Homer,YOU BETTER BE STRONG
Homer,'CAUSE I WANT A SANDWICH
Homer,OR MAYBE A MANWICH...
Homer,"Oh, the prid is gone."
Homer,"Oh, I've only got a hundred dollars. I'd better bid shrewdly."
Homer,One hundred dollars!
Homer,"Dammit! I never win anything! Ooh, here's something I'm good at."
Homer,Easy... gentle...
Homer,"I'm number one! I beat my son! Victory is mine, so kiss my behind!"
Homer,"Boon chacalacala / / In your face! / My son flips frogs like a girl, yeah! A-boom! A-ba! A who's your daddy?"
Homer,Sure do.
Homer,I'm happy!
Homer,Stupid internet... whole world laughing at me...
Homer,The internet wasn't created for mockery. It was supposed to help researchers at different universities share data sets. It was!
Homer,I know why you're here. You wanna see me humiliate myself with my stupid dance. Well fine.
Homer,Woo hoo! But why?
Homer,You wanna do my dance after you score?
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,"""L"" is for ""loser,"" which describes you, sir. Don't try to stop me. Just enjoy the view, sir."
Homer,"Honey, I bet you're wondering why Daddy's not at work again. The answer may surprise you. I have a new job choreographing end zone dances for a professional football player."
Homer,"Don't forget showboating. That's the cornerstone of my ""Pyramid of Success."""
Homer,"Ooh, I forgot crotch grabbing. That'll be the sun."
Homer,"After you prance across the goal line, you hurl the other team's mascot to the ground, and drive your cleats into his neck!"
Homer,"You're goin' down, you potato-eatin' pansy!"
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,I think I can fit you in. Let's see...
Homer,"Lenny, can I move you from Wednesday at noon to Sunday at six?"
Homer,"All right, all right, I'll work it out."
Homer,"Welcome to the ""Homer Simpson Showboating Academy."""
Homer,Today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
Homer,"First, I want you to hurl a ball at the nearest authority figure."
Homer,Nicely done.
Homer,"This is either about me, or steroids."
Homer,I'm the worst thing to happen to sports since Fox.
Homer,I wanna see him too. Maybe he can tell me how to get this off.
Homer,It soaked through to the other side!
Homer,"Wow. At last, my pathetic little life has a meaning. You suckers, I would have done it for free!"
Homer,"Dammit! Well, I'll still do it. You suckers, I would have paid you."
Homer,Dammit! Will you take a check?
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,Every single Super Bowl halftime show has been great.
Homer,I don't know. It's a lot of pressure. Do many people watch the Super Bowl?
Homer,"Uh... uh... Oh man, I have no idea what I'm going."
Homer,I wonder if other Super Bowl producers waited until three in the morning the night before to plan their halftime shows.
Homer,A church! Maybe the homeless people sleeping on the floor will have some ideas.
Homer,"Flanders. Eh, I guess you've got some late night problems too."
Homer,Have you tried checking the oil filter?
Homer,"Sure, I'd be happy to tell you my problem. I've got a venue the whole world will be watching, and nothing to fill it with."
Homer,"Yeah... you help me, and I, in turn, am helped by you."
Homer,"We now take you back through the ages, to a time before TV, before cowboys, before dinosaurs. The time of the Bible!"
Homer,The children of God once lived according to their Father's laws.
Homer,"But then a shadow of wickedness fell across the land, as represented by this cloud of white pesticide!"
Homer,But there was one righteous man: Noah!
Homer,"Oh mighty God, send a flood to destroy this wickedness."
Homer,"After forty days and forty nights, the rains stopped, and Noah sent forth a single dove..."
Homer,I thought America was hungry for meaning. I should have just sent a crocodile into space like I originally planned.
Homer,"Welcome to the ""Homer Simpson Showboating Academy."""
Homer,Today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
Homer,"Quiet, you!"
Homer,Go Seminoles! Cover-the-point-spread! Cover-the-point-spread!
Homer,"Where's the remote! This is not a drill, people!"
Homer,Barf for your master!
Homer,Lousy American-made dog!
Homer,Why must I be so voluptuous?
Homer,How do I look?
Homer,"After my makeover I'm gonna get you, boy."
Homer,Go to Hell.
Homer,"Fine, go nuts."
Homer,"I love you too, Jerry."
Homer,"Son, your mother makes a very loud point..."
Homer,"Boy, let me explain the situation in terms you'll understand."
Homer,"YOU DID IT ON THE STRAIGHT, GOT YOUR DAD'S PERMISSION / BUT YOUR MOM DROPPED A BOMB, SO I FLIPPED MY POSITION"
Homer,"BABY BOY, BABY BOY, BA-BA-BA-BABY BOY"
Homer,Bart's gone! I checked everywhere!
Homer,"If that's true, he's gonna be like NWA -- Not Without Ass-welts."
Homer,A flying rock! Call a geologist!
Homer,Follow instructions? He's doomed!
Homer,This'll be the worst Thanksgiving dinner ever.
Homer,The bad news keeps on coming.
Homer,Y'ello?
Homer,Oh yeah? Send a finger wrapped in today's paper to prove you have him.
Homer,I know what I'm doing. You can use any section of the paper. Except Metro. It's a big snooze.
Homer,Oh son!... Taking your tombstone back to the store will be the happiest thing I've ever done.
Homer,"...Bart was never kidnapped! Lisa, I'm very glad you brought me this. I'll see that it gets to the proper authorities."
Homer,"Hollywood producers have paid me a fortune, which I've already lost, for the rights to Bart's story. So I have to destroy anything that proves that story's not true."
Homer,What shirt? I don't see any shirt.
Homer,Burn the truth. Burn the truth.
Homer,You leave Maggie to me.
Homer,Not her! She'll hunt us down relentlessly -- like a bloodhound mixed with a student loan officer!
Homer,"Wow, those jackets are beautiful."
Homer,The lie is love.
Homer,Love the lie!
Homer,"Yeah, be cool. Like us."
Homer,"Coolee, coolee cool! C'mon, fool! Be coolee, coolee cool!"
Homer,"Lisa, the world is a very complicated place. And when you get right down to it... cannonball!"
Homer,"Eh, who needs tourists? They never buy my maps to stars' homes, anyway."
Homer,"Have you read them all? Okay, good."
Homer,"Two hundred bucks a couple, eh?"
Homer,"Hey, I gotta get in on this! These people have rights! The right to buy me a sixty-two inch TV!"
Homer,Now begins the long and spiritual journey to becoming an ordained minister.
Homer,"Let's see, ""Name"" ""Homer Simpson""."
Homer,"Now to answer all the pop-ups. Ooh, a talking moose wants my credit card number. That's only fair."
Homer,"...And do you, Julio, take Thad to be your lawful wedded life partner, in Massachusetts and Vermont... maybe Canada... stay outta Texas... as long as you both are gay?"
Homer,It brings me great joy to unite two such loving people. Photo mouse pads for sale out back.
Homer,"Okay, what's next? Adam and Steve or Madam and Eve?"
Homer,"Hey, what can I say? I love love."
Homer,Hm... where's Lenny and Carl?
Homer,"But I'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars."
Homer,Opposite? Yuck!!
Homer,"Hm. Well, maybe marriage isn't just for gays. What's that thing called when a guy is gay for a girl?"
Homer,"Ooh, look at me. I'm straight as a one dollar bill. La de da. Ooh."
Homer,Do you Cletus take Brandine to be...
Homer,Wait a minute! Are you two brother and sister?
Homer,"Please, Kent. Call me Your Holiness."
Homer,"Oh Kent, not anything. It has to exist. Or does it?"
Homer,"If you love the Bible so much, why don't you marry it? In fact, I now pronounce you and the Bible man and wife. And you're the wife. You owe me two hundred bucks."
Homer,Which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages. Which will put more green in the blue. The blue being my pants.
Homer,Lemme get my belt sander. Maybe I can grind the ugly off your face.
Homer,I wasn't joking.
Homer,"Yeah, big surprise. Hey Marge, here's another bomb: I like beer."
Homer,"Marge, I'd be a lot more worried about me leaving you for a sausage patty than your sister Patty."
Homer,"Now Patty, here's a veil I picked out just for you."
Homer,Give it back!
Homer,"Son, that's the stupidest idea I ever heard. And I know exactly who would pay top dollar for it."
Homer,Correction. The first blimp that got her pregnant.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Save my place.
Homer,"Yeah, ""Bride of the Monster."""
Homer,Got him! Uh-oh.
Homer,"Oh Lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as I consecrate another gay union that angers you so."
Homer,And please let thy Holy Spirit open the heart of my wife. Amen.
Homer,You handsome devil. Someday they'll let you and me get married! Can you imagine the children?
Homer,"Queerly beloved, we're here to join Veronica and Patty in matrimony. But the news isn't all good. They've written their own vows. Patty?"
Homer,Next!
Homer,"If anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now... or forever hold their peace."
Homer,"People please, can we wrap this up? It's gonna rain and I've gotta get the bikes in here."
Homer,"Patty, I admire your decision. It takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony. So I'm gonna waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge."
Homer,"Oh, I just love it here. So many things, and so many things of each thing!"
Homer,"Oh, Dad. How I'll miss your cap, your walking stick, your plaster base..."
Homer,"Dad, where's your base?!"
Homer,"Eh, they'll be fine."
Homer,"Welcome to Sprawl*Mart... Pimple cream in aisle five! Buenos nachos -- ask about our señor discount. Hey, Rabbi, Jesus loves ya. Just kidding."
Homer,That coot happens to be my father. Please continue.
Homer,Is there a chance for advancement?
Homer,Woo hoo! No pressure!
Homer,"Aw, dammit! Chief, how are we supposed to live with our kids constantly separated?"
Homer,"Don't worry, son -- no one's gonna make you count to twenty. I have a more humane solution."
Homer,"This twenty-foot pole will make Bart's restraining order oh-so-easy to enforce. And I used my Sprawl*Mart employee discount to buy this fancy pole cover. It'll keep your pole looking great, poke after poke after poke!"
Homer,Show you what it's like in the real world!
Homer,"Yeah, he's all ""Cowabunga, dude!"" What's that mean? Nothing, I bet."
Homer,Woo hoo! That's been my dream ever since I heard it existed right now. What do I get?
Homer,I won't do it.
Homer,But I'm a U.S. citizen.
Homer,Dios mio!
Homer,"Sorry, boy. This is the only place that's two hundred feet from Lisa but still on our property."
Homer,"Hey, why'd you lock the door? We're still inside!"
Homer,"I've never worked all night, never! And I worked at an all-night diner for three years! I slept on the grill."
Homer,You monster!
Homer,"That's it, mister. I am disgruntled. And up until now, I was relatively gruntled!"
Homer,I did it! I pulled it out! And with no brain damage-amage-amage-amage-amage-amage.
Homer,"Now, we'll get all your chips out, go to the police, and shut this place down!"
Homer,Really? Then why do you still work here?!
Homer,I'll be back for tall kitchen bags!
Homer,"Mmm, hot dog."
Homer,I just don't understand what the problem is.
Homer,"Son, menopause is when the stork that brings babies gets shot by drunken hunters."
Homer,"And it's something to be feared -- right, Doctor?"
Homer,"Come on kids, we should go. Goodbye, Selma."
Homer,I know. That was for the other patients.
Homer,My thingies!
Homer,"Great, another job lost to a foreigner."
Homer,I just felt a chill go through my very soul.
Homer,"How about that Selma, flying all of us to China for no apparent reason?"
Homer,"And how 'bout me getting off work by saying I'm teaching math skills to inner city youths. Yes, there are many kinds of heroes."
Homer,"Hey look, a dragon."
Homer,I'll give you one.
Homer,Hey dragon! You fly like a girl!
Homer,"You name it, oh wise mountain ape."
Homer,Nooooooo!!
Homer,"But Marge, I don't want her to be happy."
Homer,Deal.
Homer,"Okay, I'll do it. Because your sweet love is the one thing that saved my life from being an unmitigated disaster. Ha-ha, now we're even!"
Homer,"Wow, it makes the Lincoln Memorial look like crap."
Homer,"And this is Marge, our surprisingly hot nanny."
Homer,"Don't mention it, Miss October. But don't look at her passport, it's different."
Homer,"I've heard of these guys. You can wave your arms at 'em and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it."
Homer,Wha?
Homer,I hope you washed your hands first.
Homer,"Oh, look at him sleeping. He's like a little angel that killed fifty million people. Yes you are... yes you are!"
Homer,I finally get this play!
Homer,I'm a nuclear--
Homer,I'm a Chinese acrobat!
Homer,You guys are commies? Then why am I seeing rudimentary free markets?
Homer,"Nice chair toss. Good one, skinny. / You guys get these chairs from Regal Rents? / Boy, you're a great stacker. / Hi, Lisa. / Now that's precarious."
Homer,"Boy, this is easy. Maybe I am the world's greatest acrobat."
Homer,U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.--
Homer,A.
Homer,"Ooh, you're curing me with acupuncture."
Homer,Awww. She likes my eyes.
Homer,"I would, but Marge would kill me... I mean ohh, right."
Homer,"It wasn't easy, Marge -- I've missed you so much."
Homer,Is there any other kind?
Homer,"Wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate."
Homer,I am so sorry about what happened. But at least you saw what it was like to be married to me for a little while.
Homer,Who told you that?
Homer,Now let's see... which one is Ling?
Homer,Ling?... Ling?... Ling?...
Homer,Ling!
Homer,"I was this woman's husband for a few days, in name only, and beer will soon obliterate that memory. But I don't think this baby could find any greater love on your planet or ours."
Homer,But he loves me.
Homer,Why you little... I'll endanger you!
Homer,Something's wrong with Bart. He's acting weird.
Homer,"Wait, you're not Bart! Eh, close enough."
Homer,Hmmm. Seems a shame to chuck out these cross-country skis. I'll keep one.
Homer,"Let's see now... ""Kill spiders?"" We don't have spiders."
Homer,Stupid spider... afraid of dying.
Homer,Aha! Huh?
Homer,Spider poison is people poison?!
Homer,Baaart!
Homer,"Hm, where's the pain? There it is!"
Homer,A spider!
Homer,"Don't worry. If I croak, you'll marry Lenny. Or Moe -- the winner will be determined by a card game I invented. I got all the rules written down... up here."
Homer,"Sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. But I'm not gonna die for many, many years."
Homer,Haven't we all?
Homer,"None. No wait, three. Since the last one, I don't remember so good."
Homer,Yes I am.
Homer,Sssh! I want her to think I'm cool!
Homer,"If I sign it, it still counts!"
Homer,My hemophilia!
Homer,Uninsurable?!
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Way ahead of you, Marge -- I just ordered a series of tapes on saving money. They should get here soon. I paid a bundle for over-night delivery."
Homer,Okay. I'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense!
Homer,Directory assistance?
Homer,"Well, I'll get a lawyer on that. No, a whole team of lawyers. Who will dine on mustard flown in from the Orient."
Homer,"I'm sorry, Moe. Marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!"
Homer,It's my money... I'm the one who earns it... drinking beer out of a thermos like an animal...
Homer,"Marge, your penny-pinching rampage has gone too far."
Homer,"You can't enjoy money when you're dead, so why not have fun now?"
Homer,"Hey, I earn that money -- while you lounge around here, doing laundry and putting up drywall, I'm at work busting my hump."
Homer,"Yes, President Franklin."
Homer,"Well, I invented a Popsicle made of Mountain Dew."
Homer,You banged?
Homer,"No, I spent our savings on the down payment for a motor home. I need a castle where I can be king!"
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,"Kids, your mother and I have decided to take a little break from each other. While we deal with our issues, I plan to go on ""Motorhome Makeover"" and trick this thing out like a palace, not like that dump you live in. All I need is for someone to start a show called ""Motorhome Makeover."""
Homer,"Hey, I couldn't leave you kids. You're like my own family. Now check this place out!"
Homer,I've got Gameboys and caramel apples!
Homer,I'll let you punch me!
Homer,We'll have Christmas tomorrow!
Homer,Woo hoo! Free gas!
Homer,"Boy, I wouldn't mind driving that to the Holland, Michigan Tulip Festival."
Homer,"Hmmm. A place to dock, eh? I got room -- I have a back yard that makes my front yard look like an idiot."
Homer,Are you crazy? Let twelve complete strangers live on my lawn?
Homer,It's a deal! Woo hoo!
Homer,"Welcome, welcome. If my wife asks, you're here for a Boz Skaggs concert."
Homer,These are my new friends. They like me for me... and my plumbing and gas hookups.
Homer,That's a lot of places.
Homer,"Sorry, Marge. We've got the power now. And you can't turn us off!"
Homer,That's no marriage bed -- it's a loveless slab of bossiness!
Homer,Name one way I'm not!
Homer,I seem to recall you asked me to get this fat!
Homer,I'm Marge Simpson. Don't eat off the floor.
Homer,That was my Woodstock!
Homer,"Oh yeah, Marge? What about my womanly needs?"
Homer,"Hey, that judge thought I rocked. Case closed! Although my case is still open."
Homer,"If you need me, I'll be in my trailer!"
Homer,"My RV is gone! It was more than a motor home. It was a car I could go to the bathroom in. Hey, a note."
Homer,"Oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! They've stolen a car and they're home alone."
Homer,Don't worry about the SUVs. There's a gentle curve up ahead.
Homer,Bart! Pull over!
Homer,I'm not a machine -- I can't just turn it on!
Homer,Why you little...!
Homer,Thank God for that Turkish freighter. Now we'll just go get 'em and...
Homer,"Bring back our children, you Cyprus-splitting jerks!"
Homer,Will you raise them Christian?
Homer,Noooo!
Homer,"Wow, Marge -- once again, your Mom-ly wisdom averted disaster."
Homer,And I promise I will return this RV first thing in the morning. Easy... easy... easy... easy...
Homer,"Marge, you're taking this pretty well."
Homer,Cool.
Homer,"Look, we'll compromise. We'll go see a play...that Lisa doesn't want to see."
Homer,Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!
Homer,"Hey cat, get your own pants!"
Homer,Kids! Why's the cat so fat?
Homer,Make it seven!
Homer,There must have been a mistake. My body is a temple.
Homer,But he misread my pee! He misread my peeeee!
Homer,"Stupid prison guard job thinks its so big. Everyone gets a prison job but me. All my best friends are guards. They think they're so cruel and corrupt, but they're not."
Homer,Sometimes I go to the movies alone.
Homer,I'm not supposed to be new meat. I'm supposed to have your job.
Homer,"Oh my God! That man might be hurt! Guards, there's a prisoner in there!"
Homer,"Squealin'? No, I just wanted to help him."
Homer,"Really? You mean eat cheese, gnaw through electrical cords, things like that?"
Homer,"Mr. Burns, I've thought about it, and I don't wanna be a snitch. It's not an honorable life."
Homer,"Well, I am a sucker for a little hat."
Homer,Well... I don't know.
Homer,"Well, I would like to survive long enough to see the effects of global warming. I've got an inside tip that it's all a bunch of crap. Okay, you've found your snitch."
Homer,Homer Simpson has become a snitch.
Homer,"Say, is that a gang tattoo? I thought those weren't allowed."
Homer,"That's right, an unauthorized tattoo. I came here right away."
Homer,"Who? Oh, that ""my mother."" Tell him thanks."
Homer,"Well, if you really must know..."
Homer,I'm a prison snitch.
Homer,"Sure, they're on top of the world. Then there's a big riot scene. Then I don't know, I usually doze off."
Homer,What are you dopes lookin' at? You've never seen bling-bling before?
Homer,How come nobody told me before?
Homer,There's gonna be a breakout tonight.
Homer,Deal!
Homer,"What happened to the guards?! Okay, okay. Don't panic. Maybe they'll tire themselves out with their chant."
Homer,"Marge, they're gonna kill me! I only did what I had to do to survive... in a style befitting a French monarch."
Homer,"Fly, Segway! Fly!"
Homer,Marge! How did you get in here?
Homer,"Marge, c'mon!"
Homer,We'll be safe in the gas chamber.
Homer,"Marge, I'm sorry I got you into this mess. Can I snitch on my heart and say... ""I love you""?"
Homer,"Hold on a minute. Governor, I've been using my powers of snitching for evil. But now I want to tattle for good. This prison is a hellhole. They feed us horse meat -- with traces of jockey meat!"
Homer,The guards are sadistic and cruel!
Homer,You know what I missed in the joint? Just lying here watching you sleeping sweetly... sleeping sweetly...
Homer,...sleeping sweetly...
Homer,I won't tell if you don't tell.
Homer,"Listen to me! This whole building is unsafe. They cut corners everywhere. People, it's a death trap!"
Homer,How do you know the title of my prophetic vision?
Homer,What'd I miss? What'd I miss?
Homer,"Well, maybe I was partying so hard with my single friends last night, I forgot the rules."
Homer,Why? Is it messing you up?
Homer,"Stupid wildlife, serves 'em right."
Homer,"Oh, Marge..."
Homer,"Oh, right. Separated."
Homer,"Son, sometimes people just grow apart, like me and your Mom."
Homer,"She'll realize she was a fool, when..."
Homer,Hey! Come back with my patio furniture!
Homer,"Stupid flounders. Hey, I've got a great idea. We'll find some new lady friends."
Homer,"C'mon, boy, we're hitting the town. After decompressing, of course."
Homer,There's a DVD player but it doesn't work.
Homer,I know! It's a hover car!
Homer,"You wish, loser!"
Homer,"Hey Moe, hey Moe-clone."
Homer,"Boy, I think I see my two favorite letters of the alphabet. E-Z."
Homer,"Son, say hello to Edna."
Homer,Oopsie.
Homer,"Hey Marge, why are you with Krusty? These kids are too old for clowns."
Homer,"Hey, man, she's not my lady anymore. We split up, it's all cool, I... I'll kill you!"
Homer,Much better.
Homer,"Marge, I thought you'd never take me back after what I did to Krusty."
Homer,Exactly.
Homer,You don't know the half of it.
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge -- Hot Wheels to the rescue!"
Homer,"The water flows down here, through the straightaway, a couple of wicked S-turns..."
Homer,Around the loop of death...And out the mail slot! Then it's the yard's problem.
Homer,"Aw, that's it. I'm going to Moe's!"
Homer,It's raining outside.
Homer,Lousy cat.
Homer,Stupid Homer-hating family. At least there's one place I'm always welcome.
Homer,"Aw, guys. This is just what I needed."
Homer,So what's Stephen Hawking doing here?
Homer,So why didn't you invite me?
Homer,I wouldn't ruin a surprise for Lenny.
Homer,I'm sorry. I'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.
Homer,"Hey, watch what you say about him. I think Ray could be the one."
Homer,"Well, I can see I'm not wanted here."
Homer,My family hates me... my stupid friends kick me out of their stupid party! They'll all be sorry when I invent the world's best-tasting cola... and share it with no one!
Homer,A sign!
Homer,"Finally, a bar for men who like to drink and look at sexy women."
Homer,I'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear.
Homer,How did it ever come to this? I'm the first man ever to feel depressed in a bar. I don't have a friend in the world.
Homer,The sun.
Homer,"Wow, it's been so long since I've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig I am."
Homer,"Mine. Oh, move your hand. I get this!"
Homer,"Ray, you know me better than anyone. How can I get my wife to love me again?"
Homer,"Ray, will you help me fix my roof?"
Homer,"Wait, did I add that right?"
Homer,To my new buddy. Now all we need is an awesome theme song. Whatever plays next on the jukebox.
Homer,Next song. / That's what I meant. / Absolutely.
Homer,I think that means six more weeks of Autumn.
Homer,"Don't worry, honey. I found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where."
Homer,How did you know?
Homer,"You're right, Marge -- I guess I should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats."
Homer,High-five!
Homer,Ray would high-five me.
Homer,Oh Ray! You came at the agreed-upon time.
Homer,Impresses. What a big word! I'm gonna look that up.
Homer,I didn't really check. I mainly bought this house for the view.
Homer,"Some day that bowl will overflow, and I'll be there."
Homer,"Sorry about that, pal."
Homer,"One, two, three, four -- I declare a nail war!"
Homer,"Ned, are you okay?"
Homer,That's Ned Flanders. There's one in every neighborhood.
Homer,"Goodbye, Ray! Bye! Oh, he turned the corner. Ooh! Now I see him again!"
Homer,Don't worry -- Ray'll be back any minute.
Homer,"My new best friend. We think alike, we act alike, we finish each other's sandwiches..."
Homer,Ray's not gonna like that.
Homer,"Well if I was, we'd have taller kids!"
Homer,"You know son, my dad used to take me down to Johnson's Hardware. Old man Johnson knew everything about fixin' stuff. When they built this place, he hung himself."
Homer,"Oh sorry, son. I wanted you to bring me the stack of tiles from the top shelf. Hey, Ray's here!"
Homer,What's in the box?
Homer,Of course we are! If you wanna be.
Homer,I don't have to -- Ray's gonna be here any minute.
Homer,"All right, then you can just look at the portrait I painted of him."
Homer,Something like that.
Homer,Did you make enough for Ray?
Homer,He is too! His truck's gonna come around the corner riiight now. Right now. Right now. Now. Now. Nnnnnnnnow. Now.
Homer,Now. Now. Nnnow.
Homer,Oh thank God. Where is he? Tell me!
Homer,Ray wouldn't fit in my head -- he's a human man.
Homer,"Yes he does. He's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! You'll see!"
Homer,"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, how we'll laugh!"
Homer,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
Homer,What's going on? Where are my shoes?
Homer,What am I doing here? Let me go!
Homer,"Fine, I admit it. Help me, Ray! Appear and strike them down!"
Homer,"But that's not true, Bart saw him at the Builder's Barn."
Homer,"Flanders, you saw Ray on the roof with me!"
Homer,"Ned, are you okay?"
Homer,There has to be someone who saw him -- someone who doesn't hate me like Flanders and Bart... Wait! The bartender at Knockers.
Homer,"Wow. My subconscious is a genius. Well, that's all very convincing, and..."
Homer,"Well, that's a world of difference. Light me up, doc!"
Homer,"Aw, what did he die of?"
Homer,Sorry. Give me one that doesn't taste so good.
Homer,"Marge, write that down so we can have it at home."
Homer,"Nope, just you, Marge and Yogi Bear. Kidding!"
Homer,Real.
Homer,Not real.
Homer,Real.
Homer,Real.
Homer,Fascinating!
Homer,"Oh kids, I heart you, too!"
Homer,"Man, I'm glad to be off that electro-shock table. Although to be honest, I did enjoy lying down."
Homer,It's Ray! I see him again! Monster! You don't exist.
Homer,The awesome power of the human mind.
Homer,"So, Ray does exist?!"
Homer,Wait a minute. I went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding. Somebody owes me big!
Homer,That's a given! There's something else. Something much more else.
Homer,"Not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't."
Homer,What are you talking about?
Homer,What time's the show on?
Homer,And what's the network?
Homer,At what time?
Homer,"And if I wanna watch it, what day?"
Homer,And this is on the radio?
Homer,"And if I wanna see it, what time should I watch it?"
Homer,On what channel?
Homer,What day?
Homer,On the radio?
Homer,Turn the television to what channel?
Homer,At what time?
Homer,"Now if I wanted to see it on a certain day, what would be the best day to see it?"
Homer,And what time? Would be a good time to see it?
Homer,So if I turn my radio on at nine o'clock...
Homer,"So it's Mondays at nine, on NBC."
Homer,CBS.
Homer,On the radio.
Homer,Television at three o'clock.
Homer,"Marge, no machine could ever replace you. Why you-- or could it?"
Homer,Marge-bot! I'm ready for some lovin'!
Homer,Why did I give her a gun? But I repeat: no one is being replaced by a machine. Until all the kinks are worked out.
Homer,"Aw, my little boy's in love."
Homer,"C'mon, son. You can fight this. Do the Bartman. Do the Bartman!"
Homer,Why don't you dance? Dance?!
Homer,"Doctor, little kids aren't supposed to have heart attacks. They're supposed to skin their knees, and poke their eyes out, and be smothered by cats."
Homer,"You get better, son. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the ""library."""
Homer,"Milkshake Festival. Look, you can see the booths from your window."
Homer,"Lisa, take a picture of me with all the milkshakes. C'mon, everybody get in here. Hurry."
Homer,"Overeating. And if there's time, we'll get to my drinking. But there won't be time."
Homer,"Wow, he's just the kind of weirdo Bart needs."
Homer,"Son, I just wanna leave you with a piece of advice -- become emotionally dead. Leave your body. Make lots of friends!"
Homer,"That freeloading fatso! Marge, could you cut back on your makeup budget?"
Homer,So that's where my soot went!
Homer,"Even better, I'll ask him for my job back."
Homer,Youth? I hate them. Secondly...
Homer,"How much is got, Wolfgang Schmuck?"
Homer,Fifty dollars? What about all the water you guys will waste with your bathing and showering and washing your clothes?
Homer,"Güten abend, my brave, Bavarian Overlords. The best wurst in town."
Homer,NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS / AUF IHREM WEG ZUM HORIZONT / HIELT MAN FUER UFOS AUS DEM ALL / DARUM SCHICKTE EIN GENERAL /
Homer,"EINE FLIEGERSTAFFEL HINTERHER / ALARM ZU GEBEN, WENN ES SO WAR / DABEI WAR DA AM HORIZONT / NUR NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS"
Homer,"Did you hear that Foxy, the Fox network Fox?"
Homer,Oh boy.
Homer,"Marge, I know this is ill-gotten, but can we use it to..."
Homer,Time to take out the Euro-trash.
Homer,"Now, everything's perfect again."
Homer,But who else needs to lose weight? Maggie? Grampa? My seldom-seen half brother Herb?
Homer,Why is everyone looking at me?
Homer,"I am not too fat. I'm alive, aren't I?"
Homer,"Oh, that's terrible."
Homer,Where will I sleep?
Homer,Cheeseburger.
Homer,I don't wanna.
Homer,Here's a corner.
Homer,You're a selfish jerk.
Homer,But it's my burger.
Homer,Fine. I'd rather die.
Homer,I need change for a dollar.
Homer,What's the cheapest thing you've got?
Homer,Five ninety-nine?! What a rip-off! Someone should shoot you!
Homer,Interesting. It's like a corndog without the dog.
Homer,"I don't miss meat at all. This Portobello mushroom eats like a steak. A rubbery, fungus-like steak."
Homer,"Marge, I'm giving birth to a food baby."
Homer,I think it's staying down. It's staying down! It's not staying down.
Homer,"Wait. Yes, it's staying down. Oh no, it's not! Yes it is. No it's not! Yep. No. Yep. No! Yep. No! Yep. No. Yep. No. Yep. no."
Homer,Where's my bucket?!
Homer,Lisa sings so sweetly and Bart is my pillow... everyone's good for something.
Homer,"And she's giving us the emotional experience of a lifetime. Oh, thank you for this angel, Lord!"
Homer,"Don't lose hope, sweetie. I'm gonna write you a song so great, you can't lose. And that's not just the beer talking. Your father's in here too."
Homer,"Here you go, honey. Sing this."
Homer,"Much of the tune is plagiarized. Now go, go, go!"
Homer,"You did it, sweetie!"
Homer,"Of course, Sweetie. You and I are gonna write and sing our way out of this godforsaken Hellhole."
Homer,"I wrote it about Shelbyville, then changed the names."
Homer,"Good job, sweetie. Every time you hit that note, I'll shoot a glass with my BB gun."
Homer,"Honey, our time together is precious to me. I didn't want to say anything, but I don't think I'm gonna be around much longer."
Homer,"Well, Moe's getting a big screen TV in February. Just in time for the Pro Bowl. Maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win."
Homer,Let Daddy go talk to the man.
Homer,May I have a word with you?
Homer,"Is that green enough for you, sweetie? 'Cause I can make it greener..."
Homer,"Don't worry honey, the song I wrote you is so schmaltzy, it'll make ""Moon River"" sound like a farting Orangutan."
Homer,"Marge, Lisa and I were just discussing how to improve tonight's performance. Now you're confusing her by telling her she was perfect."
Homer,My little girl likes Red Vines! You little...
Homer,You think I can't kill you? There's a hundred little punks graduating from Syracuse this year that would beg to kiss my ass! Get outta here!
Homer,"Hey, these are Red Vines. Here you go, sweetie. Daddy got you your candy."
Homer,"Hey, gimme a break. Living through Lisa is the healthiest thing that ever happened to me."
Homer,You love sausage but you hate to see it getting made.
Homer,Then would you like to see it getting made?
Homer,Fired... me?
Homer,"Everything I did, I did for you."
Homer,Do you know the hours I worked? The people I had to yell at? The tires I had to slash?
Homer,It's called smoozing!
Homer,"Hey, come back! I'm calming down! We'll have family fun! Family funnnnn!"
Homer,"Hey, everybody...I brought a guest."
Homer,Someone who appreciates my in-your-face management style.
Homer,Ha! Smart move. Soon the whole world will be lining up to suck my nose. After I make my new client a star.
Homer,"His name isn't Cameron anymore. He's now ""Johnny Rainbow."""
Homer,I'm not Mr. Simpson. That ship has sailed. I'm Colonel Cool! And I'm the Captain on this rocket to the stars.
Homer,Neither. I'm both.
Homer,"All right, I wanna teach you a little something about jazz hands."
Homer,Don't stop till it's as natural as breathing.
Homer,Marge. Bart. Maggie. Santa's Little Helper. Lisa!
Homer,I don't think cookies are gonna make me feel better.
Homer,"Oh God! Oh, they're delicious! Oh, so happy! Oh God, they're... They're gone."
Homer,We are!
Homer,Flanders?
Homer,"Okay Morty, gimme a rose-colored spot, tight to the mid-chest and an aqua background with an astronaut on a surfboard."
Homer,Lisa.
Homer,"Um, at the end of your song, remember to look into the spotlight. It makes your eyes twinkle."
Homer,You're welcome.
Homer,"I always was, honey. Look. Cameron's about to sing the song I wrote for him. He's about to learn the most important lesson in the music business: don't trust people in the music business."
Homer,"Sure did. I'd do anything for you, honey. Especially if it's easy."
Homer,I'll always be there. Not even death will stop me.
Homer,"How 'bout ""I love you, honey?"""
Homer,"Kids, wanna go to the mall?! They're baking fresh Cinnabons... which means they're throwing out the old ones!"
Homer,"Oh, I love you, Dumpster-bons."
Homer,"Oh, big surprise. The fat guy's eating garbage."
Homer,"""Left Below."" Ooh, a ""He Is Risen"" production!"
Homer,"Finally, a character I can relate to. I bet good things happen to him."
Homer,Left below?! Where have I heard that before?
Homer,It's everywhere!
Homer,"This movie will haunt me for the rest of my life, just like Cannonball Run Two."
Homer,Marge... what if the Rapture is coming and I haven't led a good enough life? I could be... left below!
Homer,"Yeah, I'll bet the cats would be psyched about that. Thanks Marge, you've put my mind at ease. Now how about a little ""rapture"" for Mama?"
Homer,"Okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship."
Homer,Marge is right -- the Rapture isn't coming! There haven't been any ominous signs!
Homer,Blood is raining from the sky!
Homer,Judgment day is at hand.
Homer,"Begat. Uh, do you have any books on the Rapture?"
Homer,I'll take everything you've got!
Homer,"No, thank you."
Homer,"Marge, the Rapture is nigh. These books will help me figure out how nigh."
Homer,This whole deal is scientifically proven. The Book of Revelation has four hundred and four verses... add the number of people at The Last Supper...
Homer,...minus the number of Filipinos in the Bible...And you get...
Homer,"He writes ""3150518"" on the board."
Homer,Up bup bup!
Homer,"Three fifteen p.m., May 18th! That's when the Rapture will be!"
Homer,A week? That's...seven days from now!
Homer,The world will end next week! Spend your children's college fund! Thaw that turkey now!
Homer,"Funny story, Kent. It's the end of the world! God loves you! He's gonna kill you!"
Homer,"Here's my angle: there's no way in God's Heaven I should get into God's Heaven. But maybe he'll let me in, if I warn others the Apocalypse is coming, as I previously shouted."
Homer,Uhhh...
Homer,"Here's one -- Revelation 6:13. Just before the Rapture, ""the stars will fall to the Earth."" So all you hippies out there might want to for that one."
Homer,"Marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane."
Homer,Well... I guess this thing does look pretty silly. Let's all take off our sandwich boards and watch TV.
Homer,"When the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here."
Homer,"Exactly. It came to me in a vision. Or maybe it was a drunken haze. Or, possibly, an ice cream headache."
Homer,"No, Flanders. It's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. You wouldn't be interested."
Homer,"All right, everybody. Pair up with a Rapture buddy who will watch your back through all eternity."
Homer,"But sweetheart, I have something they didn't have -- a good feeling about this."
Homer,"C'mon, Lisa. No one in this family is being left below."
Homer,"Don't worry, Dad! There's a bus coming for you! Drive, drive!"
Homer,"Okay, guys. Get ready! We're just seconds away!"
Homer,"Goodbye, stupid Earth!"
Homer,Huh. My watch must be running fast. Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
Homer,Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
Homer,Wait for it... wait for it...
Homer,Please don't go! Please? Please? I command you!
Homer,"Lisa, you still believe in me, don't you?"
Homer,"Aw, that's my girl."
Homer,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Let's go to Moe's. We'll walk and punch.
Homer,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Huh?
Homer,"Moe, what happened to your eponymous tavern?"
Homer,"Hey, you with the tempura -- your arm broken?"
Homer,"...Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen?! Twelve apostles... but Jesus was at the last supper too! This changes everything."
Homer,"Multiply by seven... don't forget to carry the six, six, six..."
Homer,"Wake up! The Rapture is coming in half an hour! There's no time to waste! Marge, grill a chicken! No, make sandwiches! And some Kettle Chips would be nice! Original, not barbecue!"
Homer,Forget school! We have to get to the mesa!
Homer,But my prediction says--
Homer,Stupid family... won't even come to my Rapture... I went to Lisa's school play -- which had serious pacing problems.
Homer,Three... two... one...
Homer,"Oh, I'm wrong again. I'm nothing but a big, fat... oh!"
Homer,Woo hoo! I was right!
Homer,And there's the Earth. So beautiful with your many rings.
Homer,I'm comfortable like this.
Homer,How come it's not open yet?
Homer,Hm...
Homer,Thanks. Listen... could you do me one more favor?
Homer,"Oh, sorry, uh -- I'd tip you, but I don't have any cash."
Homer,I could.
Homer,"Wait! Before you go, there's one thing I gotta know. What happened to my family?"
Homer,I've gotta save them.
Homer,"Lord, you got a first-class destination resort here. Really top notch. But I can't enjoy myself knowing my family is suffering."
Homer,"Oh, he'll be fine. And you could still spare my family by--"
Homer,"Buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy."
Homer,"Screw you, Dino! You squandered your gift!"
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,I'm sorry. But Heaven isn't Heaven without my family in it.
Homer,"Just send me back to Earth, and put off this whole Rapture hoop-de-do for another couple of years or so."
Homer,Superman did it.
Homer,"No, I'm in a good place with that."
Homer,"Yeah, I'll definitely read those later."
Homer,"Now listen, if you could just see your way clear to..."
Homer,It was all just a dream.
Homer,"But what are these wings? Oh, it's just a seagull stuck in my back."
Homer,"Yeah, I missed you guys too. Now if you'll excuse me..."
Homer,"Thank you, Lord! It's back the way it was."
Homer,Ah... this is heaven.
Homer,"Prison overcrowding, I've got a solution for that. Oh my God! U-S-A! U-S-A!"
Homer,"Free movie tickets?! I feel like Roger Ebert, or his kiss-ass new partner!"
Homer,She'll be fine here under the watchful eye of Grandma Shark Week.
Homer,How about this guy?
Homer,"Shut up, Flanders, I need a favor. Would you mind watching Maggie for a while? It would only be until later."
Homer,"Come on Flanders, doesn't that ""Bible"" of yours say to ""love thy neighbor""? Why won't you love me?"
Homer,"Thanks, Ned."
Homer,You wear a bathing suit in the bathtub?
Homer,Makes sense.
Homer,"This theater sucks. My seat's uncomfortable, the screen's only half a screen, and that guy's eating an apple!"
Homer,Yes.
Homer,I've had enough -- I'm leaving!
Homer,I'm stuck. Why did I eat that apple segment?
Homer,"What are you kids laughing at? And if you say Jimmy Fallon, I'll know you're lying."
Homer,Scantily-clad co-eds?
Homer,Why you little... I'll teach you to have a libido!
Homer,Wait'll I tell everyone about this! I'll feel important without drinking! That'll be weird.
Homer,What a combination -- hot chicks and stupid Flanders.
Homer,"Yep, and nobody's tellin' him. Not even his good buddy God."
Homer,"Sensual, isn't it? And the best part is Stupid Flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. Hence my nickname, Stupid Flanders."
Homer,"Hey Moses, are you a loser?"
Homer,"Yes I am, Homer."
Homer,"Son, I need to pee, but I can't stop watching. Fetch me a bottle."
Homer,"Uh, we're watching the latest photos from Mars. Ho, great stuff. Worth every billion."
Homer,Well that's obvious. He doesn't even know.
Homer,"Uh, I'm thinking about getting a yogurt franchise. It's called ""Plops"" and..."
Homer,"Okay. Flanders, you see..."
Homer,"Ned, I had no choice. It was just so funny!"
Homer,Mmm... soggy br--
Homer,...ead.
Homer,You're right. But you know who the real victim is here? Ned.
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,What's this? Goodbye Springfield...
Homer,Last-diddily-ast? He's gone! And it's all someone's fault!
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. I've taken every precaution."
Homer,"Hi, I'm Homer Simpson. I live next door. So, is that your whistle?"
Homer,"Um, listen, uh, neighboreeno, I want to start our relationship off on the right foot, so if you need anything... anything at all..."
Homer,"Don't worry, I'll straighten things out with Coach Clay. We're good buddies. We play this game called ""who can punch the softest?"" And he always lets me win!"
Homer,"Hey Coach, do you mind turning down the music? My baby's trying to take a nap."
Homer,Lookin' good... feel the burn...
Homer,You're a god!... I can't think of any more!
Homer,Go! Go! Go!
Homer,"Hey, you knocked out my power. How am I supposed to eat without watching TV?"
Homer,When are you gonna stop poking me? Will it be soon?
Homer,But I siphoned that gas from Flanders! Flanders...
Homer,Like a woman who's made the biggest mistake of her life.
Homer,"Oh, I was just driving around the mid-Atlantic states, ringin' doorbells at random, and I just... oh, who am I fooling with my awesome lies? I want you to come back to Springfield."
Homer,After the party.
Homer,"No, I wanna make you a respecting stock. I don't know if you've noticed, but I've borrowed a lot of your stuff over the years..."
Homer,"Shut up, Flanders. But some things I could never take from you: your kindness, your gentle spirit..."
Homer,"...and your infinite patience with a big, dumb jerk like me. Oh, Ned, I don't deserve you as a neighbor, but will you forgive a young, handsome fool and come home?"
Homer,I am a little pudgy. You got me. Yeah.
Homer,I saw my advantage and I took it. That's what heroes do.
Homer,"Okay, Ned. Get ready for your welcome home surprise."
Homer,Maybe. We don't know that for sure.
Homer,Go nuts.
Homer,"Flanders. Okay, that's it. Really irritating!"
Homer,"Boy, I can't believe you got expelled. Well, don't expect to spend all week lying around on the couch like a bum 'cause that's my thing!"
Homer,"And if you get kicked out of that one, you're going straight in the Army. Where you'll be sent straight to America's latest military quagmire. Where will it be? North Korea? Iran? Anything's possible with Commander Cuckoo Bananas in charge."
Homer,"How can we afford any of these private schools? They're all so expensive. If we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get Grampa that new pacemaker?"
Homer,Get 'em from the smoke detector.
Homer,The smoke will wake us up.
Homer,"Catholic school, eh...?"
Homer,"That'll straighten you out, boy. There, you don't just get bad grades -- you go to Hell!"
Homer,Classic Grampa.
Homer,"I didn't need that new fact! Now I forgot who won Bud Bowl Eight. Boy, I'm pulling you outta that crazy school!"
Homer,"No meat?! What do they eat, light bulbs?"
Homer,Bart! What the Hell are you saying?
Homer,Mickey Mouse's dog?
Homer,"Hey! I'm Bart Simpson's father, and I'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values! Hey, what's that smell?"
Homer,You've transformed breakfast into dinner. It's a miracle!
Homer,"Log Cabin full of taste, my stomach is with thee. Blessed art thou among syrups and..."
Homer,"All pancakes aside, I really came here to talk about my son."
Homer,Bingo? That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
Homer,That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
Homer,Bingo!
Homer,You have to cheat.
Homer,"Uh, listen, is it true you priest guys can't ever... you know..."
Homer,"Celibacy?! I was talking about the meat on Friday thing. Man, you guys got more crazy rules than Blockbuster Video."
Homer,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No matter what I did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?"
Homer,"Okay, let's make some magic here. I wiped a booger on your shirt, I made a dog and a cat kiss, I swiped a bolted-down TV from a Holiday Inn..."
Homer,"...I coveted the wife in ""Jaws 2,"" I lied to a waiter, I masturbated eight million times and I have no plans to stop masturbating in the future."
Homer,"Woo hoo! I'm clean! In your face, Lord!"
Homer,Right. And how do I join? Do I whale on some Unitarians?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Look, Marge, I know I was supposed to yell at that Priest, but he's so cool. He plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!"
Homer,"Marge, no one is saying twelve. Nine, ten, tops. See..."
Homer,"Marge, relax. I've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion."
Homer,"Wow! Up here, that feels good!"
Homer,Transubstantiation!
Homer,"Welcome to the jungle, Kevin!"
Homer,"Marge, what are you doing here?"
Homer,"Marge, you bring Bart home now! Once you go Vatican, you can't go back again."
Homer,"Face it, Marge -- Catholics rule. We've got Boston, South America, the good part of Ireland, and we're making serious inroads in Mozambique, baby!"
Homer,Why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children? Shouldn't Bart and I be able to choose our own religion if we want to?
Homer,Bwa?
Homer,"Hop in, boy! We'll show your mother our god kicks her god's butt."
Homer,C'mon Broncos... you can do it...
Homer,"The Broncos won?! Why didn't I bet on them, like Professor Pigskin told me to?"
Homer,He's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!
Homer,Because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system.
Homer,"I've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row, and every time, the ""pick of the week"" has been right on the money."
Homer,I have money!
Homer,"A scam? Not according to ""Eddie F. from Tucson,"" or ""Football Millionaire in Beloit, Michigan."""
Homer,...expiration date oh-six oh-eight.
Homer,Professor Pigskin told me to bet on the Raiders but they look awful.
Homer,"Hey, I didn't bet any of our money. I just borrowed some from him."
Homer,"It's not my fault the Raiders lost, it's Professor Pigskin's!"
Homer,But the pig!
Homer,"Marge would kill me! Please, there's gotta be something else I can do. Like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. I can't do it next week."
Homer,"All right, you can shoot your gay adult film at my house."
Homer,They're shooting an adult film at my house tomorrow. How am I gonna get rid of Marge and the kids?
Homer,"Thanks, Moe!"
Homer,"It got your hopes up, didn't it?"
Homer,I swear.
Homer,Because you look even more beautiful now than the day I married you.
Homer,"Guys, get out of here!"
Homer,"Look, if you promise never to tell her, I'll let you be in the movie."
Homer,Are you guys almost done?
Homer,"Um... you're in the wrong house, lady."
Homer,"Honey, please, just listen to what I have to say."
Homer,I owed the mafia money...
Homer,Where are you going?
Homer,When will you be back?
Homer,Who's gonna watch the kids?
Homer,Me? But I'm the father.
Homer,"Honey, come back! You didn't say bye to the kids!"
Homer,"Well, we'd better go eat that yogurt."
Homer,"Kids, I'm sure your mother will be back soon."
Homer,"Look, we've been down this road before. I do something stupid, your Mom leaves, we eat waffles."
Homer,"You mean ""Homer's famous marinara sauce."""
Homer,Where's your sense of magic and wonder?
Homer,"C'mon, Marge. When are you gonna call?"
Homer,Let it ring. Play hard to get. That's hard enough!
Homer,Oh-my-darling-I-love-you-please- forgive-me.
Homer,Moe! What are you calling me for?
Homer,"Well, what if Marge tries to call while I'm talking to you?"
Homer,"Of course I have call waiting, you idiot! I just never learned how to use it!"
Homer,Uh-oh. That might have broken the phone. I'd better call Moe.
Homer,Moe! Will you get off the line!
Homer,"Oh, Marge. What a pleasant surprise."
Homer,"No, no. It's not gonna be like that, I swear."
Homer,"Ew, lemon cream! You're goin' in the Marge pile. I mean I love you so much..."
Homer,Hello? Marge? Where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?
Homer,"Hello, Marge?"
Homer,"Does the pizza guy take a check? If so, where do we keep the checks? And lastly, how do you write a check?"
Homer,Gotta find your Mom. Gotta find your Mom.
Homer,It was hard enough gettin' you in there. I'm not lettin' you out.
Homer,Rugged? Is that the same as handsome?
Homer,"Okay, kids, we'll stop for the day. I have cousins near here. We'll stay with them."
Homer,"Oh, the rubiest. Ooh look! A new restaurant chain!"
Homer,We'll say it's all our birthdays!
Homer,"I warned you he was an idiot. Well, all I need is some moonshine and someone playin' the har-mon-a-key, and I'm as happy as a pig in plop!"
Homer,Don't laugh! They're doing the best they can.
Homer,"Oh, just great. Things couldn't be better."
Homer,"She, uh, was killed by a falling air conditioner."
Homer,"It wasn't all bad. As part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned."
Homer,"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to use the outhouse again."
Homer,You lost that first game to hustle me!
Homer,Marge?
Homer,These are for you.
Homer,"Listen, I thought about what I did. And it was really, really wrong. I'm sorry."
Homer,"I love you, Marge."
Homer,Wha...?!
Homer,You're needed at home!
Homer,You're needed at home!
Homer,"Well, that's very reasonable."
Homer,You stole my wife! I'll kill you!
Homer,Wow. I can see why she loves you.
Homer,You know everything.
Homer,And what a man!
Homer,"Okay, the key to this thing is the manatees. Is Marge saving them or killing them?"
Homer,"Okay. To save the manatees, I guess I could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that."
Homer,Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
Homer,"Look, if it were up to me, I'd be harassing them with you. If anything, I'd be the guy who took it too far. But I love my wife and I want to win her back!"
Homer,Rubes.
Homer,Catch me if you can!
Homer,Manatees -- defend!
Homer,Poor dumb country mouse. Can't even count.
Homer,"Rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! Please, no rubes..."
Homer,"Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Hey, since we've got the kids with us, why don't we all take a few days of much-needed R and R?"
Homer,Yes... but I've got a friend who owes me a solid.
Homer,"Flanders, I can't listen to your crap before my coffee."
Homer,Stupid best friend Flanders.
Homer,Stamps? Those are for snail mail! Stamps rule! I mean suck!
Homer,"I think they killed each other. You know, one of those murder-suicide deals."
Homer,What man would want this now?!
Homer,Two four six eight! I hate stamps! They aren't great!
Homer,"Okay, how about this? Seven, four three one... oh wait, that's my pin number. Everyone forget that."
Homer,"Look at the bright side, Marge. When I die, you can mourn me from the bathroom. That's multi-tasking."
Homer,"Okay, just let me clear some space."
Homer,"Hey, I love waking up drunk in the morning."
Homer,"I, uh, needed them for my remote control helicopter."
Homer,There's a little plastic man in your hair and I'm trying to rescue him.
Homer,No soldier left behind.
Homer,"Lisa, honey, if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow, we'll do something special, just for you."
Homer,I can't believe it took us forty minutes to get here. Why can't they build a stamp museum closer to our house?
Homer,"Lisa, when you've sustained as many blows to the head as I have, consistency is something, something that, something I love you, Bart."
Homer,I thought it was twenty.
Homer,I can't believe you're making money off this!
Homer,No one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --
Homer,Butter face.
Homer,That's bull man.
Homer,"Oh, and that Dr. Hibbert was so boring... ""Homer, we've got to get that lump checked out... Homer, we must discuss your test results... Homer, we've got to find you a donor..."" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
Homer,Lisa!
Homer,"You see, sweetie, when a mommy and a daddy are married for years and have nothing new to talk about, they bad-mouth their closest friends."
Homer,"Oh, and I spy with my little eye something with four legs that can't run."
Homer,"Exactly. Now, what has two ears but can't hear?"
Homer,"Tragically, yes."
Homer,"Okay, Marge. But don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up."
Homer,"Don't worry, he's not showin' up."
Homer,"Boy, Lisa's room really is scary."
Homer,"Finally, back in the only safe bedroom in the house."
Homer,You know that racecar bed I made him?
Homer,The brakes are shot.
Homer,"Learn to drive, boy!"
Homer,Uh... this is all I could find.
Homer,Why you very little...!
Homer,Stationary camera.
Homer,"Now Marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake..."
Homer,"Run, Marge! Start the car!"
Homer,And you won't... unless you can leap through fire!
Homer,Lisa! Lisa!
Homer,"Where's Lisa, boy? This book's gonna solve all her problems."
Homer,"Although if we were evil spirits, we'd probably assume the shape of your parents."
Homer,"Marge, we owe her the truth!"
Homer,"Lisa, honey, please wake up. If you do, I'll get you a new pony."
Homer,Uh... this is still part of your dream. Dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.
Homer,I forgot to floss this morning!
Homer,"Praise the Lord, I can walk again! What, my foot fell asleep."
Homer,"Aw, poor Maggie."
Homer,"I know, and you did, and you're great."
Homer,"Oh. You always gotta work blue, don't ya Marge?"
Homer,You're better than that.
Homer,Can't even go in my own kitchen... Bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.
Homer,"Noooo! Bart, that's a really bad storage area!"
Homer,"I dunno, maybe. Plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox."
Homer,Why would you do that? Are you a bad parent?
Homer,So you want Maggie to infect your kids?
Homer,And would they pay handsomely for the privilege?
Homer,...Fifteen dollars to infect your kids!
Homer,"Now featuring the Pox Box! Pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. Like any disease box, results may vary. Pox box!"
Homer,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... Maggie!"
Homer,"Now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome Mr. Krusty the Clown!"
Homer,"Goodbye, thanks for coming. If my party made you sick, tell your friends!"
Homer,"Mr. Stomach, are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Now make with the pizza, Fatso. You're the stomach!"
Homer,I have to do this for work.
Homer,"Marge, what's happening to me?"
Homer,I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day.
Homer,I'm so itchy!
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,Mmm... Homer-oats.
Homer,"Y'ello? No, I'm not coming into work. I have chicken pox. I know I said that last month, but I was lying."
Homer,"Right... right... right... right... okay... right. I love you, bye!"
Homer,"I just got fired. Better check the ""Want Ads."""
Homer,"Ooh! ""Truck drivers needed in Iraq."""
Homer,Trucks are like big cars.
Homer,Okey-doke. And you are...
Homer,Will she know what this is regarding?
Homer,"That's ridiculous! No woman would want to have sex with that loser! And, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. Good stuff."
Homer,This-this is Marge's bra. I bought it for her boobs!
Homer,"Of all the people for Marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me?"
Homer,"Well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but I have one more question: did you sleep with Kirk Van Houten?"
Homer,I repeat: did you sleep with Kirk?
Homer,You're not saying no.
Homer,I'm still not hearing no.
Homer,"Well, methinks the lady doth protest too much!"
Homer,Gladly.
Homer,I came to get my mail.
Homer,"Resident... occupant... I can't open these. Ooh, a traffic ticket!"
Homer,I'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back.
Homer,"Well, I'd better go."
Homer,"You know the Four Seasons? Well, I'm experiencing them first hand, because I'm living in the park."
Homer,"Well, I got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad."
Homer,Where's my bucket?
Homer,"Bart! We're all disappointed there's no potato salad! But for God's sake, don't jump!"
Homer,"I'm a-comin', boy!"
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Make it two kajillion.
Homer,We'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.
Homer,Of course I do. The only thing I can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me.
Homer,I guess we should count our blessings he's not dead.
Homer,"Wow. A robot kid would be a blast. We can confuse him and make his head explode. ""This statement is a lie. But if it's a lie then it must be true. But if it's true, then it must be..."" Kaboom!"
Homer,"Now, I'm a man who likes to strangle his kids. Do you think I could..."
Homer,Why you metal...!
Homer,"Wow, the windpipe is incredibly responsive!"
Homer,And he's great with the neighbors.
Homer,"Nice and hot-o, Mr. Robot-o!"
Homer,"David, you're by far the best son I've ever had. Uh-oh."
Homer,Replace is such an ugly word. We upgraded.
Homer,"Here, make me a kitty!"
Homer,"Lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. In the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the American dream."
Homer,"I'm really sorry, but our family just can't handle both of you boys. I hope that somewhere deep in your data banks, you process fond memories of us."
Homer,"The sad part is, there were times when I actually had feelings for you. I almost felt I was your father."
Homer,"David feels, and your mother will agree when I tell her, that it's best for our family if you're no longer in it."
Homer,No toys!
Homer,"Heyyy, it's Bart! Super!"
Homer,You wanted to believe the lie!
Homer,Those were my good pants.
Homer,This stinks! I've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that's not equipped for an adult diet.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Suckers.
Homer,"Honey, animals don't feel death. That was proved by the scientists at Black Angus."
Homer,They look a little green.
Homer,Yes I am! I mean...
Homer,Oh no! I've been killed!
Homer,Outfoxed 'im with the corpse of my best friend. Hee-hee.
Homer,Marge! You saved me.
Homer,What was that for?
Homer,"Aw, I can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions."
Homer,"Well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?"
Homer,Marge isn't home.
Homer,"They'll bounce back, son. They're a strong people."
Homer,Ooh! Ooh! I wanna ride the bumper cars!
Homer,I call the red one!
Homer,A strongman? Are you for sale? 'Cause I need someone to throw a birdbath at my neighbor.
Homer,Hmmm. I suppose I could use a little toning.
Homer,I'll give you five dollars for it.
Homer,"Marge, I don't hate your mother. I just won't be sad when she dies. Forty-seven, forty-eight..."
Homer,"Yeah, sure. Whatever you want. Ninety-five, ninety-six, thirteen, sixty-four, banana..."
Homer,You want me to ride a whatsickle built for who?
Homer,But I'm watching television. A lot of people worked hard on this show!
Homer,"Three hundred and six, three hundred and seven..."
Homer,Woo hoo! Pizza for breakfast!
Homer,"Hello, Domino's? What do you mean, you're not open? No, you call me back during business hours! I'll show you who's a recorded message!"
Homer,"Hey, what's the big idea of getting trapped under that thing?"
Homer,Just liftin' this dumbbell.
Homer,Forty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine... fifty thousand!
Homer,"I'm pretty happy with this baby, now it's lefty's turn."
Homer,"Wha? Hey, you..."
Homer,"Excuse me, Mr. Bartender sir, may I have a sugar-free ginger ale? And uh, make it flat -- the bubbles burn my buds."
Homer,I'm joining the professional arm-wrestling circuit!
Homer,"Negatively, I assume."
Homer,"Gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. Maybe she doesn't care anymore!"
Homer,Okay.
Homer,I can't believe Marge hasn't called me. Maybe I should go home.
Homer,Did she say anything else?
Homer,"Oh Marge, I love her so much."
Homer,He looks tough.
Homer,I can relate. I've fought that foe and lost many times.
Homer,"Moe, I'm starting to have grave doubts about this thing I barely liked in the first place."
Homer,"Sorry, Moe. The place for my arm is around my wife."
Homer,SWEET HOME ALABAMA...
Homer,"LORD, I'M COMING HOME TO YOU / Alabama!"
Homer,"Marge, spending time with you is more important to me than all the pie-eating contests in the world."
Homer,I was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. Now let's go to bed.
Homer,That song is a pop music footnote! I didn't say stop!
Homer,'TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY...
Homer,"Kids, this is the holiest night of the year. Tomorrow is Father's Day, and that makes tonight Father's Day Eve."
Homer,"JOY TO THE WORLD, A FATHER'S BORN / LET ME RECEIVE GREAT GIFTS!"
Homer,No Father's Day Eve... does this mean there's no such thing as... Daddy Claus?
Homer,Is there a Super Bowl Bunny?
Homer,"Oh, can I come with you? I know I can't."
Homer,What a great Father's Day!
Homer,A LeatherBuddy! There's no limit to what I can do with this.
Homer,"Fear not, m'lady! Captain Dash Superstud is here with his small tool!"
Homer,"Bart, this is the greatest present I ever received. To open another gift now would be like following the London Philharmonic with Jessica Simpson. Whatchu got, Lisa?"
Homer,What the Hell is this?
Homer,"Oh, it's heartfelt. There's no escaping that. Thanks, honey."
Homer,"No, no, no, it's great. I'm done with it now."
Homer,"Aw, isn't that cute?"
Homer,It's not my fault! Lousy magnet.
Homer,"""Happy Birthday Dad, From Lisa."""
Homer,I still don't understand how her feelings can be hurt. It's my day.
Homer,"Yeah, but I know how to win women back. I even won you back after I lost our wedding album in a bar bet."
Homer,I mean I will win you back.
Homer,"I'm sorry I made you feel bad, honey. But I'm gonna show you just how much I care about your feelings. One adult and one baby, please."
Homer,Her first words! Play along. It's fifty cents less for babies!
Homer,How you doin'? So... is that your jacket on the back of that chair?
Homer,Does it still keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold?
Homer,"Oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. It's a little harder to shut up."
Homer,"Oh, I know! But how can I undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?"
Homer,I don't know. What happened to the last Safety Salamander?
Homer,I can do that!
Homer,"Okay, Lisa. Time for Daddy's big surprise!"
Homer,"Sometimes it's scary when your dreams come true, isn't it, sweetie?"
Homer,"Yeah. Now, I'm off to bring safety to Springfield Elementary and win back your love!"
Homer,"What's that, honey? I can't hear you very well!"
Homer,Salamander awayyy!
Homer,"Sorry, Bart!"
Homer,The first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt.
Homer,Then what protects you if we crash?
Homer,Stop this bus!
Homer,"Look, Lisa. I made safety happen!"
Homer,Safety tip ninety-nine: always double-bolt your easel.
Homer,Son-of-a... Questions? Comments?
Homer,"Did I hear ""where are the fireworks?"" 'Cause heeere they are!"
Homer,Every man for himself! Trample if you must!
Homer,Safety... safety... die for safety.
Homer,"So, sweetie, am I your hero again?"
Homer,"Now honey, you know Daddy's not allowed in the zoo anymore."
Homer,But I'll never stop trying to redeem myself in your eyes.
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,This looks like a job for a dad trying to win back his daughter's love!
Homer,"No, she's not."
Homer,Only three?
Homer,That's more like it!
Homer,"Please, you're embarrassing me."
Homer,What can I do? I'm only one man.
Homer,Are you sure there wasn't a midget in his hat? I read an email that said there was.
Homer,Hmmm. I will run for Mayor!
Homer,And I'll find out what a Mayor does!
Homer,"Expand my brain, learning juice!"
Homer,"Oh, I hate press conferences."
Homer,"Marge, without this outfit, I'm just Homer Simpson, multiple felon. With it, I'm a costumed hero like George Washington or Dame Edna."
Homer,"Today marks a new dawn for Springfield. This salamander is sitting on eggs labeled ""elder care"", ""flex-time,"" and ""downtown pedestrian mall."" And those eggs are ready to hatch!"
Homer,"Now, I will take your questions."
Homer,"Well, there's my X-ray vision, my fire breath... and I can get big laughs with tennis balls."
Homer,"Bloop, bloop, bloop. Bloop, bloop, bloop."
Homer,Why should we let this election be influenced by a photo taken hours ago?
Homer,"Now, restaurant matchbooks for everyone!"
Homer,"Hey, people may not love Homer Simpson, but they love this suit. Just like they love their stupid American flag."
Homer,It's the smell of impending victory.
Homer,A little.
Homer,"No, but I swam in it."
Homer,But aren't you gonna have fun finding out?
Homer,That's weird. He started off as an egg.
Homer,"That's an excellent question, Kent. First of all..."
Homer,What the? It must have shrunk when my wife washed it!
Homer,"That's right, I am a man! The man who dressed like a salamander to win back his daughter's love. Let's meet her now."
Homer,"Uh, well, my son is here too. Let's meet him now."
Homer,"Please, stop throwing fruit!"
Homer,"Aw, thanks. Now how 'bout a dance with your Daddy?"
Homer,I can't believe I lost after Ben Affleck campaigned day and night for me.
Homer,"Whups, be careful of my tail."
Homer,I still feel it. It's so itchy. Itchy...
Homer,"Hey! Nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy! Whoops, wrong one."
Homer,"I'll take that... Too slow, Drooly Joe... Peek-a-boo! I steal from you!"
Homer,Silly rabbit... kicks are for ribs!
Homer,"You're like all Easter Bunnies -- can't take a punch to the crotch! Maybe next time you'll think twice before you volunteer to help children. Oh, hey Marge."
Homer,"Ladies. Marge, is there a small rip in my pants?"
Homer,We throw those out anyway.
Homer,"Hey, good looking. Wanna snuggle with ""Tyrannosaurus Sex""?"
Homer,"Oh, come on, honey, you have lots of friends. There's, uh... Lisa and...the stove."
Homer,"Oh, that poor woman. I am gonna find her a friend! Someone cute, athletic, with a nice laugh."
Homer,It's a risk I'll have to take.
Homer,"Son, I need to find a new friend for your mother. So you're gonna have to finish the shopping yourself."
Homer,I wish. I made these at work.
Homer,Hmmm. I bet she'd be a good friend for Marge. She looks defeated too!
Homer,Psst. Psst!
Homer,"Hey Marge, where you goin'?"
Homer,Why does every woman I try to talk to run into cans?
Homer,"Marge, I did it! I found a woman to be your new friend! She's waiting in the living room!"
Homer,I bet you can't throw a cat over the house.
Homer,Huh. I was wrong.
Homer,"Marge... in a gang? What're you gonna do, shoot me with a frosting gun? Seriously, I would love that."
Homer,"Wait a minute... if she's going bird watching why did she leave our ""Peterson's Field Guide to Birds"" on the kitchen counter?"
Homer,Roadrunners are real!
Homer,"Now, let's see what Marge is up to. ""Recipes,"" ""dress patterns,"" ""toaster undercoating agreement""... ""Heist plans""!"
Homer,Burns' Mansion?! That's Mr. Burns' mansion!
Homer,I gotta stop Marge from doing something reckless and irresponsible.
Homer,"Marge, I wanted to save you from the cops, but the cops followed me! Game over, man! Game over! So, are you gonna introduce me to your friends?"
Homer,I'm not!
Homer,"Oh, well... I try to have a good time."
Homer,And tell me I'm not fat.
Homer,"Listen, Marge. No matter where you go in this life, you'll always have one friend who loves you body and soul."
Homer,"And Marge, there are certain things I can do for you that no other friend can. Special things."
Homer,"BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP..."
Homer,"BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP... BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP..."
Homer,"DO, DO, DO DO / DO, DOOO..."
Homer,"Charge! I mean, yes sir?!"
Homer,A Lamborgotti Fasterossa? That's the car I think about when I make love to my wife.
Homer,You're sending me to Italy?
Homer,Can I take my family?!
Homer,Do I have to hang out with them?
Homer,"Hey, that guy in first class is taking a TV out of his armrest."
Homer,What's in you?
Homer,A buncha stupid cables.
Homer,That flag is mine! Don't mess with Texas!
Homer,"Shock and Awe, losers! Shock and Awe!"
Homer,"Now we have to drive it straight to Rome, where it'll be shipped to Mr. Burns in Springfield."
Homer,Marge... are you encouraging me to be irresponsible?
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"Wow! I've seen photos of this, but you can't really experience it until you're here."
Homer,A McDonald's where you can get booze!
Homer,"Eh, there's a picture of it on my cup."
Homer,Savages.
Homer,Let me check the navigation system...
Homer,It says that we should turn left at a fat chick in a tu-tu being fed by a midget.
Homer,I get it -- the midget represents dwarves.
Homer,Don't worry. We got the cheese insurance.
Homer,Nooooo!
Homer,"Stupid Italy... wish you'd never been unified by Victor Emmanuel the Second... if only you'd stayed a loose confederation of city-states, trading with each other and occasionally warring."
Homer,"Hey, do you know anything about fixing sports cars?"
Homer,It's a Lamborgotti Fasterosa XT 550 with ABS Sport Tech package.
Homer,Americano? What the Hell could that mean? Why can't you people learn to speak my language? I learned to eat your food!
Homer,I honor you and your country.
Homer,"Yes, tell us your story. But it better have a beginning, a middle and an end. And you'd better make us root for the protagonist."
Homer,"Okay, so far I'm rootin' for ya."
Homer,Holy moley!
Homer,"I always thought you were, you know, ""out loud and proud."""
Homer,"Yeah, I never went to college."
Homer,"Yeah, I tell Marge everything! Not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such."
Homer,"All right, Bob. We won't tell your beautiful new family that you're a homicidal psychopath -- if you fix up our car."
Homer,I thought I was doing Donald Trump.
Homer,Prego?
Homer,"I love you, Marge."
Homer,Sideshow Bob!
Homer,"It's called a hangover, sweetie. And it's an unavoidable part of life."
Homer,"Mr. Burns, we may be experiencing some technical difficulties."
Homer,What am I supposed to use it for -- transporting water to distant urban centers?!
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Lazy Romans.
Homer,Everyone remember where we parked.
Homer,Opera? They have that here too?
Homer,Can I be the Phantom of the Opera?
Homer,But I do a great impression of him.
Homer,"I am the gayest super-villain ever! Beware my scented candles! Oooooo, scented!"
Homer,It's so beautiful...
Homer,"I know, and he's magic!"
Homer,"Hey, knock it off."
Homer,Maybe he's cheating on us with the Episcopalians.
Homer,"Look at 'em, with their bright, airy narthex and light, flaky Eucharist. I wouldn't mind dipping my hand in their font."
Homer,Did anyone order a hero?
Homer,"Okay, Christmas, Christmas... you know how your paper boy always sends you a Christmas card with his home address on it? What's up with that?"
Homer,No tip till they bring back Hagar the Horrible!
Homer,"Oh, it's never anybody's decision... anyhoo... I'd like to tell you all a little story I call ""The First Christmas."""
Homer,A carpenter named Joseph was about to get some frankly preposterous news...
Homer,And did you know that little Baby Jesus grew up to be... Jesus?
Homer,"I know, it's weird, isn't it?"
Homer,My God... it's over... We're free!
Homer,I said we're free!
Homer,I hope I never hear that God-awful nutcracker music again.
Homer,I TOLD GRAMPA WE'D BE AWAY
Homer,That's great! Now I'll just get my present for you. Which is... right outside the door.
Homer,"Oh my God, I forgot to get Marge a present!"
Homer,"I NEED A PRESENT FOR MY WIFE / OR I'LL HAVE NO SEX FOR LIFE / DIAMOND RING, A VASE BY MING / SOME KINDA USEFUL KITCHEN THING"
Homer,I NEED A STORE I CAN BREAK INTO
Homer,OR A PLACE RUN BY A HINDU!
Homer,"Oh, it's just what I wanted. Here, Marge, this is for you."
Homer,I don't care what that letter said. This man raised me single-handedly. When I think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he...
Homer,"Lifeguard, huh?"
Homer,"So this guy might be my real father, and his name starts with ""M"". Moleman? Mr. Burns? M. Night Shyamalan? That would be a twist worthy of his increasingly lousy films!"
Homer,The only tummy ache is in my head. I can't stop wondering who my real father might be.
Homer,"There's only one lifeguard whose name begins with ""M""!"
Homer,Mason Fairbanks...
Homer,His hobbies are philandering... writing letters... and making up for lost time!
Homer,"Okay, until you're sure this guy's cool, stick to your cover story. Oh, that sounds hard. Just do it!"
Homer,"Uh yes, I'm a reporter with the local paper. I'm doing a story on people who... wear sweaters. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?"
Homer,Interesting. Interesting.
Homer,"So, I infer from all the knickknacks you're some sort of fruitcake."
Homer,"Oh, that is so cool! Ooh, a dish of shrunken heads!"
Homer,"So, you don't have any shrunken heads?"
Homer,"That is small, right?"
Homer,"Uh... you know it's a boat, right?"
Homer,I'm sure my listeners would love to know the story behind that name.
Homer,No... I said I work for a radio station. Nine-eighty on the AM dial but number one with our viewers!
Homer,Uh... well I... I think you're my pappy!
Homer,"I found this letter you wrote to my Mom, Mona Simpson."
Homer,Possible Daddy!
Homer,I'm sorry... I got a little carried away there.
Homer,"Marge, I found my real father! His name is Mason Fairbanks, he has a knife just for cheese, and he talks like this ""Homer, please do that in the loo."""
Homer,"Hm, honey, you've given me a lot to think about... tomorrow, when we're on Daddy's boat!"
Homer,"Wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?"
Homer,"Listen, old-timer, I'd like you to meet Mason Fairbanks."
Homer,"Mason, come see my room!"
Homer,Who's Mason Fairbanks?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,And my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on.
Homer,"Ha-ha! That's what you get for being luminous, jerks!"
Homer,"Hey guys, we found the treasure! When I get to shore, I'm bringin' it right to the bar."
Homer,"Oh, which way did Mason go? That must be him over there."
Homer,What do I do? What do I do?
Homer,Daddy... daddy...
Homer,I drew this picture of you.
Homer,That is so sweet.
Homer,Dad...
Homer,Wait. Can we have a moment in private?
Homer,"As I lay dying on the ocean floor, I remembered everything you've done for me. To Hell with that stupid DNA test and its ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, seven per cent accuracy -- you're my dad, and I love you."
Homer,But how?
Homer,Only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.
Homer,"Aw, Dad."
Homer,"Now, why don't you stay for dinner."
Homer,Send up two hams!
Homer,"Hey, this one's cold!"
Homer,Listen... I wanted to ask if you could do something my former father never did for me.
Homer,Teach me that the stove is hot.
Homer,But I'm not tired!
Homer,You made that TV show really mad.
Homer,"Hmm, this camp's got it all -- climbing some kind of rope thing, wearing a backpack, high-fiving the black kid. It's the perfect thing to straighten you out."
Homer,"Hey guys, I have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then I'll be back to go to Vegas!"
Homer,"Boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system."
Homer,I don't tell your mother how much I've lost.
Homer,One child to Portland! He's your problem now.
Homer,"Why, there must be some mistake."
Homer,"Oh yeah?! You're going to that camp, 'cause I'm gonna drive you there."
Homer,Stupid Bart... makes me drive to Oregon... home of unspoiled forests... birthplace of Matt Groening ...
Homer,You mean Fun Homer? I'm afraid Serious Homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.
Homer,It's no use.
Homer,Eh.
Homer,"Boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act."
Homer,"At least you have something you're good at. I'm thirty-eight years old, drivin' a crappy car, with a son who doesn't respect me, and I'm one Snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes. Mmm, Snickers pie."
Homer,"So, I see you're also traveling with your son. What boy prison are you taking him to?"
Homer,"See Bart, I told you things could be worse."
Homer,"Look at me, I use a napkin."
Homer,"I bet they're from Massachusetts. You know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son."
Homer,"Don't forget to wash your hands, Shakespeare."
Homer,"Yeah, I'll have the smiley-face breakfast special."
Homer,"Uh, but could you add a bacon nose? Plus bacon hair, bacon mustache, five o'clock shadow made of bacon bits... and a bacon body."
Homer,Fine. But the bacon man lives in a bacon house!
Homer,You know who would really like this place? Bart. Wait a minute... where the hell is Bart?
Homer,You little monster! Show your face this minute!
Homer,"Bart, where are you?!"
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,I'm stuck!
Homer,Ow! Someone's hitting my butt with something!
Homer,"Leave your ass, Homer. Leave your ass."
Homer,"So Lenny, how's it goin' in Vegas? Pretty boring, I'll bet."
Homer,"I've got you now, boy."
Homer,Boy! Push down on the bumper! Then I can back the car up and save myself.
Homer,Shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are.
Homer,I'll kill you! I'll kill your whole family!
Homer,"Kidding! I'm kidding! We can do that, we have a special friendship."
Homer,I'm gonna double kill you! And then I'm gonna bury you in a shallow grave. Then I'll dig you up and kill you again! That's the beauty of a shallow grave.
Homer,"You sweet little angel. Oh, I'm gonna rip your head off. And spit down your adorable little neck. Because I wanna smash your little stupid head. Oh, but I love you we'll go on a fishing trip. But first I'm gonna put you on a sawmill then punch your little face out. That's what I'm gonna do!"
Homer,"Well boy, you made the right choice. I think this is the first step to a new, closer relationship between us."
Homer,"I don't enjoy it. Being a father is just a job. Long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling ""you screwed me up""!"
Homer,"Hey, I enjoy you plenty."
Homer,Talking time is over.
Homer,"Thank you, Colonel."
Homer,Woo hoo! Vegas here I come!
Homer,I miss Bart! I can't leave him in that awful camp!
Homer,"I'm comin', boy!"
Homer,I bet this looks cool from overhead though.
Homer,"Woo hoo! Vegas here I come! Oh right, Bart."
Homer,Stupid horse! It's a deer crossing!
Homer,"Wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!"
Homer,"Son, I'm doing something I should have done a long time ago... taking you to Vegas!"
Homer,And don't you try to stop us.
Homer,"Uh, normal wear and tear."
Homer,Try this one...
Homer,"Uh, Marge. Me and Bart got in a fight with this really un-cool pit boss, and now we're in Nevada State Prison. Also, I don't know where Bart is. If you see him, say ""hey."""
Homer,"Marge, I ripped my pants! The only pants that understand my complex hiney."
Homer,Ow! My ass!
Homer,I paid for fifty laps and I'm gonna take them!
Homer,I'll have to go to every store in the pants district to find another pair like these.
Homer,"OH, WOULDN'T IT BE ADEQUATE?"
Homer,"Mr. Stern, would you make those glorious blue pants again if I whipped up public interest for them?"
Homer,"Through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting, I haven't even thought of it yet."
Homer,How long is this commercial anyway?
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"It's called ""headvertising."" It creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media."
Homer,It's not supposed to.
Homer,BLUE PANTS! BLUE PANTS!
Homer,Fine.
Homer,I'M GETTING BLUE PANTS IN THE MORNING / DING DONG THE ZIPPER'S GONNA SHINE...
Homer,"Well, it did its job. Everyone's wearing blue pants now."
Homer,"Earning us a hundred bucks a week, that's what. Except the Maine potatoes one. It's just a reminder to myself."
Homer,Silly Indians. Our God made their god.
Homer,I'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work.
Homer,"Save me, Tsisnajini!"
Homer,I'm stuck! And I have to pee. Now I'm just stuck.
Homer,Why you little...!
Homer,"Don't leave me! I hate to be alone! Except when I'm watching TV, then leave me alone. But right now, don't leave!"
Homer,Will you tell me a story?
Homer,No unicorns.
Homer,"Wait, wait, wait, wait..."
Homer,Now you're telling me Burns's story?
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Gotcha.
Homer,I'm bald!
Homer,"Hey bar-boy, dance around like an idiot. Like this!"
Homer,I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!
Homer,"Sure! You're gonna be all ""I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!"""
Homer,Moe has a cappuccino machine??!!
Homer,"Boy, come here and listen to Lisa's story. It's about Moe's treasure!"
Homer,"Hey Moe! Thanks to you, I've been sober a week!"
Homer,You didn't think it was so horrible when you were falling down the hole.
Homer,"Well, it was very moving, but the thing is, bats are chewing my legs!"
Homer,"Oh, why did I lead you down here to find those stupid coins?"
Homer,"Well, I guess I should explain. Not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so I was out in the forest, hiding."
Homer,I deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave.
Homer,I figured he'd never miss two or three pieces. Money which we could use to pay for Bart's operation.
Homer,That's a story for another day.
Homer,I realized I could never find the gold without your help. So I made it this week's family outing.
Homer,It's a lot of little stuff. God has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave Saturn?
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. Me and ""Terrible Two"" here are gonna win that computer for you."
Homer,'Cause he wants it.
Homer,"Now to begin ""Operation: Slight Edge""."
Homer,I'm winning!
Homer,"He's headed for the old mill. No, Cheatie, no!"
Homer,So many paddles.
Homer,Protect the duck! Protect the duck! Produck the tect!
Homer,"Hey, this race is for rubber ducks, not meat ducks!"
Homer,Woo hoo! I won!
Homer,A living duck! I wished too hard and he became real!
Homer,Hey... that's the same thing you said to Bart after he choked in that soccer game. And we both know he sucked.
Homer,Just put it in the trunk and leave.
Homer,A canoe made of country ham? You know I'll eat it.
Homer,I heard in study hall you were babysitting tonight.
Homer,"So Marge, in tomorrow's game I'm gonna recover a fumble just for you."
Homer,Don't pressure me. I get enough of that from my Dad.
Homer,Old Man Flanders!
Homer,Springfield High football rules!
Homer,"No one turn on the sprinklers, okay?"
Homer,Fine. As soon as I finish watching my show.
Homer,"Old showbiz animals, eh? Do you think any of the gremlins from the ""Gremlins"" movie are there?"
Homer,I am gonna get them so wet.
Homer,Sad? You're crazy. I feel like I'm at the Oscars for the animals I forgot existed.
Homer,My son's been ape-napped!
Homer,Aren't you gonna do something?
Homer,But she'll leave the rest of him alone?
Homer,"Oh, you haven't seen Bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume I let something terrible happen."
Homer,"I know what you think: when stupid Homer wasn't looking, Bart got kidnapped by a monkey."
Homer,"And now I'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, so later I can say that I already told you."
Homer,"Oh, you're so right. I guess I should be more concerned with Bart's safety than covering my own butt. And maybe I'm talking like this because I can't stop. Help me, Lisa! I have serious mental problems!"
Homer,Bart! Bart!
Homer,"When the monkey falls asleep, I'll sneak you out in this trash bag. Then I'll come back and feed the monkey a peach full of antifreeze."
Homer,I fell asleep before the monkey.
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Hey Monkey, eat tranquilizer dart!"
Homer,"Lisa, monkeys don't have feelings. If they did, then my experiments could be called cruel."
Homer,"Marge, Toot-Toot and her son escaped!"
Homer,Mr. Teeny?!
Homer,I am so stoked about Lenny's party. He said he's gonna make a surprise announcement!
Homer,"Why the hell would he want to do that... blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich? I like your hat, sweetie."
Homer,I mean the one at the house.
Homer,Oh my God!
Homer,How did Lenny get to be Newsfake Magazine's Man of the Year?
Homer,What?! Next you'll be telling me he didn't meet Woody Woodpecker!
Homer,"Lenny, this TV is amazing. If you're not careful, I might just spend the rest of my life on your couch."
Homer,"You're right, Lenny. I..."
Homer,Lenny! Bring me a beer and your deepest chamber pot! Chop-chop!
Homer,Look at that picture quality -- you can see the soulless emptiness in that shark's eyes.
Homer,"Ooo, ""Two and a Half Men!"" You can see the soulless emptiness in Charlie Sheen's eyes."
Homer,"Later, if I have enough energy, we can walk up to the TV and I'll show you how thin it is."
Homer,"Oh yeah, well right there's a commercial with a dancing cold sore."
Homer,"Wow, I can actually feel the heat."
Homer,Can you at least take a picture of me with the TV?
Homer,"Oh yeah, good times."
Homer,Stupid non-plasma TV. Picture so blurry. Might as well rub dirt in my eyes.
Homer,Oh Marge! I love you! I love you! I love you!
Homer,There's a chance we won't win?
Homer,My collection is complete. Forty years of the Family Circus.
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,The big screen TV?
Homer,All expenses paid?
Homer,"Hey, funny man, say something funny!"
Homer,Don't lean out of the tra--
Homer,"So, what's the prize on this wife swap show?"
Homer,That's just the product I've been coveting! Pick us! Pick us!
Homer,Are you kidding? Take a look at my DVD.
Homer,They'll never let me near Lake Havasu again.
Homer,I'm signing us up for a reality show where we trade you to another family.
Homer,"Oh Marge, you're the greatest mom ever. I want the whole world to see that."
Homer,"Oh really? Bart, when did you get your tenure?"
Homer,"Yeah, well I have full tenure."
Homer,I'll bet the twist is he's gay.
Homer,"Because we'll be on TV, and earn enough money to buy a TV. TV."
Homer,"Yes, TV-sa?"
Homer,"Listen up, Stonehenge. I made a drawing of the places on Marge you can't touch. Especially the hair."
Homer,You take forever to say nothing.
Homer,"Ya know, you don't seem like the money-hungry semi-stripper who's usually on Fox. Why'd you do it?"
Homer,"I see. Well, I should be getting to the living room..."
Homer,"Well, he didn't get the prize pig at the fair, either."
Homer,"Yeah, that's how I feel about Notre Dame football."
Homer,I don't know why I ever married that woman.
Homer,"Uh, okay."
Homer,"There's this guy that got killed -- I think it was in Miami? So C.S.I. Miami investiga-ted-ed it. Then a family said how much they loved the Olive Garden. Then I fell asleep. When I woke up, Letterman was talking to Alias."
Homer,What's that delicious smell?
Homer,She's nowhere to be seen. Time to let Homer be Homer.
Homer,"Oh Marge, thank God you're back! She made me spend time with the kids. And not just TV time. Talking time!"
Homer,Maggie? She's in her crib.
Homer,"So it would appear. However, Cousin It, there, was born a woman."
Homer,"Yeah, well, I'm gonna vote ""No"" on Thirty-eight so you can't adopt."
Homer,Kidding! Kidding! I don't vote! The polling place is up a hill and I never make it!
Homer,YOU MAKE ME LAUGH / YOU MAKE ME CRY / WITHOUT YOU I'D JUST / WANT TO DIE / FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE / YOU'LL BE A FIXTURE / NOW LET ME ENJOY / YOUR PICTURE IN PICTURE...
Homer,"And Marge, you're pretty great too."
Homer,I thought it was about her boobs.
Homer,"Tonight on Jock Center: a slugger on 'roids, Tiger Woods is annoyed, and North Korean missiles deployed!"
Homer,"I've had enough of your stinkin' thinkin'. I, Homer Simpson, will personally bring the new pro football franchise to Springfield."
Homer,"God, we have fun."
Homer,I'll show you all. I'm gonna spearhead the hell out of this expansion bid!
Homer,"Marge, meet pro football's newest team: the Springfield Meltdowns!"
Homer,Plus I designed a state-of-the-art stadium. We'll fund it with corporate naming rights. It's the Duff Beer-Krustyburger-Buzz Cola-Costington's Department Store-Kwik-E-Mart-Stupid Flanders Park!
Homer,So... Homer do good?
Homer,Maybe he's thinking of a new shape for the football.
Homer,You mean...
Homer,You're a useless old man! Name one thing you do for this family.
Homer,"Yeah, you're right."
Homer,"Y'ello. You want my opinion on current movies?! Well, first of all, they're all perfect. Also: when's the Cap'n Crunch movie coming out? And will it be ""R"" or ""Hard R""?"
Homer,"Lisa's right! It is a cool, super sport!"
Homer,"Ooh, a penny. This is my lucky day."
Homer,"Yep, my lucky day."
Homer,Hurry up and kill it! I have to be at the opera by seven!
Homer,I love it when Mr. Burns shows a movie at work.
Homer,Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie!
Homer,"Woo hoo! I win! In your face, best friends!"
Homer,"Hey, Marge it's what I've gotta do to keep this family living in luxury."
Homer,"Oh my God, you're right! I'd better call the guy."
Homer,"Send someone right over! Ooh, here he is."
Homer,"Yeah, well while I'm gone, you'll do what he says."
Homer,What about her.
Homer,I'll miss you kids too.
Homer,That's me!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,A book?
Homer,"Oh, the cereal's just a metaphor."
Homer,"Thanks, sweetie. I've never been less angry to receive a book."
Homer,"This isn't India! Where's the University of Notre Dame, the Indy 500, Wrigley Field, Dodger dogs --?"
Homer,Oh no! I took a job on the other side of the world!
Homer,"Oh, I hate this sub-continent."
Homer,Lisa! It's me! I'm in trouble!
Homer,A cow took my iPod and I punched it!
Homer,"Uh-huh... Do I have to? Okay, okay, I'll show the cow I adore it."
Homer,"Oh baby... ooo, did you lose weight?... oh c'mon, baby, don't play hard to milk..."
Homer,"Okay, Apu said his cousin Kavi could help me out."
Homer,"Let's see... Apu's cousin is medium height, dark complexion, brown eyes, black hair..."
Homer,Are you Kavi?
Homer,Are you Kavi?
Homer,Finally.
Homer,Sorry I'm late. I was doing Carnak with my bodyguard.
Homer,Hindu. What do you call the moisture on your Hin?
Homer,"Uh... duh... uh... um... uh... duh... Did I say ""um""?"
Homer,"Okay book, I didn't read you, and you didn't read me, but we're both in this together, so say something smart or get ready to run like hell. Um... ""In business as in breakfast, fried eggs have fragile yolks... huh, huh?"
Homer,Just outsource it to Lisa. Outsourcing is the answer to everything.
Homer,Outsourcing!
Homer,"Well, a little book once told me..."
Homer,...having only one pancake leaves room for more bacon.
Homer,You're giving me absolute power?!
Homer,I'm not a God. God has a white beard and invented the Da Vinci Code.
Homer,"Hmmm, let's see. You got the Elephant Man, Johnny Six-Arms, Papa Smurf... these guys are pretty cool. Maybe I am one of them. If only I had some kind of proof."
Homer,I won a free soda! I am a god!
Homer,I am a God! I know all!
Homer,"Silence! Now for my amusement, let the monkey fight the elephant."
Homer,Marge?
Homer,It's... um... Jannnn... Febbbb... Marrr...
Homer,May firrr... seconnn... thirrr...
Homer,"Well, I'm just glad I'm not a god anymore. I wanna go home. How's Chief Wiggum?"
Homer,"Yeah, he's funny."
Homer,"I'm so bored, I figured out where the wallpaper pattern repeats."
Homer,"See, it goes: ship's wheel, Popeye tattoo, Gilligan hat, fish with boobs... and back to ship's wheel."
Homer,My life's work ruined.
Homer,"Outta my way, you God-fearing Buckleheads!"
Homer,Hide me!
Homer,"Please, you've gotta help me! If they find me they'll kill me."
Homer,"Oh Lord, please let the soldiers kill this family instead of me."
Homer,"So, thou art a widow, eh?! Then the codpiece holds no terrors for thee."
Homer,Oh baby...
Homer,What kind of a booze cruise is this? Where's the hooch?
Homer,"Stupid Flandish. Uh, listen, since all the other fun stuff is out of bounds, how 'bout a little Bible-thumping in the crow's nest? What do you say, Miss..."
Homer,She's gonna marry him 'cause he wears boots instead of blackening his feet.
Homer,Why thee little...
Homer,May I escort you to the railing?
Homer,Beer? I thought you guys didn't drink on the Gayflower.
Homer,What-ever.
Homer,"But baby, a man has needs."
Homer,"People, this is madness! We can burn the witch later! Right now, I've got to save this ship!"
Homer,"Hey, I've been driving drunk since I was twelve! But first...who's gonna help me pee?"
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. I'll see to it you fundamentalist Christians live to take over all America by the twenty-first century!"
Homer,"Man, that bird did it all. Good guy."
Homer,Land ho!
Homer,I do!
Homer,"Well, I guess we have time for my tale of moist adventure. It takes place in a dark time for mankind when madness and ignorance ruled: ""the nineteen seventies."""
Homer,"My wig! I mean, my natural hair!"
Homer,I've got an idea: climb into my mouth.
Homer,Nooooo!
Homer,"Catch me, Flanders!"
Homer,Woo hoo! It's almost New Year's! Ten... nine... eight...
Homer,...three... two... one... Happy New Year! My resolution is to be more fun!
Homer,"Uh, gimme a second, I'm in the bathroom."
Homer,What? I have great ass suction. Now how 'bout a little privacy?
Homer,My keys!
Homer,"All right, I can see this is all up to me."
Homer,"Swim, fatty, swim!"
Homer,Don't tell me what to do.
Homer,"Oh my God, our boat is upside down!"
Homer,Or will ever do.
Homer,"Hey, it says here ""the book"" was written by Tom Stoppard. This isn't a book, it's a play! Book."
Homer,"Hey, check it out, I'm Scratcher or something."
Homer,They're gonna divide the school in two?
Homer,"Well, you know what a man invented? Actual paper."
Homer,Which goes great with another male invention -- the car.
Homer,"Let's see, men also have: rocket ships, suspension bridges, constitutional government, snow shoes, brass knuckles..."
Homer,"Pinball machines, the Renaissance..."
Homer,"Oh, why did women invent sleeping on the couch?"
Homer,"Hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?"
Homer,You seem cool. Wanna catch a movie?
Homer,Let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.
Homer,"So... do you wanna ""wang chung"" tonight?"
Homer,"Well, uh... uh... Honey, you're just as smart as a man. Sometimes when I'm with you, I feel like I'm doing it with a dude."
Homer,"Well, I won't be lonely. I can always cuddle with the dog."
Homer,At least everyone knows I'm smarter than you.
Homer,How did this happen?
Homer,Screw you! I'm never gonna pay!
Homer,"Fine! I'll finish it myself. And don't think I'm gonna screw it up, because I won't!"
Homer,"But sweetie, I just wanted to tell the '74 Oakland A's how I felt about them."
Homer,My work here is done.
Homer,I'm needed at the door!
Homer,"Seventy-four? Oh sorry, there's been a mistake."
Homer,"On second thought, I am Brenda Wine cooler."
Homer,"Son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things: bills, jury duty, Entertainment Weekly. Now, for once, I'm getting' rich-person mail. You wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?"
Homer,"Okay Weingartens, what else is in your mail?"
Homer,"Ooh! Marge, you wanna go to a wedding of a couple we never met?"
Homer,"Mark and Tracy, I remember the first words I heard you say: ""I do."""
Homer,"Take that, liberal media."
Homer,"Marge, I don't have to sit here and listen to your insane ravings about me getting other people's mail."
Homer,She's opening her eyes!
Homer,She doesn't recognize us!
Homer,You monster! What have you done to my face?!
Homer,When will Marge remember us?
Homer,Jogging?!
Homer,Sweet!
Homer,Jogging?
Homer,"Marge, I'm gonna take care of you until your amnesia goes scram-nesia. I got you flowers a fluffy pillow...and a nice, relaxing private room."
Homer,I'm your husband!
Homer,I am! We're the same age!
Homer,I do eat a lot of crap.
Homer,"Great news, Marge -- we're goin' home."
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"Yeah, but he's cool with it. Right?"
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Now the doctor said a tour of the town could help bring back your memory.
Homer,"Those ""freaks,"" as you call them, are some of our closest friends."
Homer,"See that ball of fire? That's the sun. It goes by many names: Apollo's Lantern, Day-moon, Old Blazey. The important thing is never to touch it."
Homer,"Yes, now you do."
Homer,I'd better get ready -- I'm next!
Homer,"All right, Marge... time to remember Admiral Awesome!"
Homer,Why do you remember them and not me?
Homer,Okay. All it'll take to unlock your memories of me is one of these blasts from the past.
Homer,"Here's me fighting with former President Bush, me fighting with current President Bush, and here's me showing a bag of apples who's boss."
Homer,"Well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose."
Homer,"When a man and a woman love each other very much, they--"
Homer,But what if we...
Homer,You used to love my non sequiturs!
Homer,"Oh no, Bart and Lisa are gonna tell me something horrible!"
Homer,"Marge, if I can't make you remember me, then I'll make you fall for me all over again."
Homer,The heart is the symbol for love.
Homer,So beautiful. I wish I could understand Italian.
Homer,Just wait. We're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever!
Homer,"It was in that plywood castle that we first... well, you know..."
Homer,Oh you loved it -- especially when the windmill came around and whacked your but.
Homer,"No, it was the happiest night of my life! The warm Spring air, the swings I took in the batting cage afterwards... Don't you remember, darling?"
Homer,"I know. Wait, I thought of another way: I stay!"
Homer,"Marge, I realize you've made up your mind, and I want you to know that I deeply respect your boo!"
Homer,I know. I just thought maybe... boo!
Homer,Boo.
Homer,"Well, the rest of your life for sure."
Homer,That might be Marge!
Homer,Marge?
Homer,"I sure have, pardner."
Homer,"Oh no! He's Marge's, and my, dream man! I've gotta make a play for her now or I might lose her forever!"
Homer,At least she's found someone who can make her happy.
Homer,You idiot!
Homer,Do you know what you just gave up?!
Homer,"The wisest, wettest man you'll ever meet."
Homer,"You just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. In ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. Every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. And there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. And you blew her off."
Homer,Really? Well she's still great!
Homer,I'm so happy we're together again. Wanna get a drink?
Homer,"Uh, yeah. I started when you were in the hospital. I was so worried. Recently I tried this thing called ""beer."" And..."
Homer,But do you also remember that you're an enabler?
Homer,And her?
Homer,And her.
Homer,What about him?
Homer,"Yeah, I have their baseball cards."
Homer,Look at all those people. You know them?
Homer,"Yeah, she's over in post now."
Homer,"Not me -- but we can't get rid of him, 'cause he's friends with Richard Sakai."
Homer,"Oh, he ain't gettin' married. He has commitment issues!"
Homer,"When you get to third base, I'll buy ya a beer."
Homer,All right. Just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle.
Homer,Woo-hoo! Weapons!
Homer,Don't start the exhibit without me!
Homer,Look at that line.
Homer,Time to do what I do best -- ruin it for everybody.
Homer,"Hey, Flanders! Thanks for saving our place."
Homer,"Aw dude, I was totally here. You calling me a liar? In front of my kids? 'Cause I'd take a bullet for you, man. Right in my mouth!"
Homer,"Oh, no you don't!"
Homer,I'm everywhere.
Homer,"Wow, this 3-D is amazing! You can actually feel the vase!"
Homer,"Sorry, Flanders. But when you get in, you can use my audio tour. Narrated by Melanie Griffith."
Homer,Good riddance. Their drawings suck and they look like hippies.
Homer,My mind is always open to new ideas.
Homer,Onions in the peas! What the hell?
Homer,This is the break in the case we've been waiting for!
Homer,Poor Bambi... poor Thumper...
Homer,"I love it when you're not into it. Oh yeah, baby. Oh yeah that's it ignore me. I'm not even here."
Homer,"Thanks, Marge. It's not a twist-off!"
Homer,C'mon...
Homer,C'mon! Open! I want what's in you!
Homer,"You, stupid..."
Homer,"Oh wait, it was a twist-off."
Homer,Now you can only see butts on cable.
Homer,The Isotopes are winning? To the bandwagon!
Homer,Nothing beats a day at the ballpark with my family.
Homer,"Tickets, tickets, who needs tickets?"
Homer,"Don't worry, I'll use the money I make to buy tickets from a scalper. Then I'll sell those tickets, and we'll be rich! Rich! We did it, baby! We made it through the rain!"
Homer,"Tickets, thirty dollars! Big game, everyone wants to see the game..."
Homer,Cop! Act like you're in love with me.
Homer,Bart! Hand me that sack of batteries!
Homer,Nine Volt! Double A! D!-D!-D!-D! Cordless drill!
Homer,Look at that ugly old man.
Homer,Really? You'd kiss an ugly old man like me?
Homer,"What a game! I got on the kiss-cam, I participated in ""the wave,"" and I got to pee in a trough! Marge, can we get a trough?"
Homer,"Ooh, iced tea!"
Homer,Buck Mitchell!
Homer,"Yes, yes. The game you played so horribly at."
Homer,Season tickets?! I could entertain business clients. I might even land the Henderson account!
Homer,Sure. That means she wants to talk in private. It's probably about you.
Homer,"Hey, we've gone through more hardships than the Jews and Charlie Brown put together."
Homer,That's just how I feel.
Homer,Buck Mitchell!
Homer,Sorry I'm late! I was just gathering my counseling equipment.
Homer,"Now let's remember: no one's right, and no one's wrong, till I say so."
Homer,"Wow, I think we've really hit on something here. Unfortunately, we're out of time. How does that make you feel?"
Homer,"Shut up, my ten o'clock's here."
Homer,"Interesting, interesting...."
Homer,"Buck, you've got a beautiful woman with a hot body that any man would fantasize about, even while making love to his own Marge."
Homer,"Good idea, honey. Buck, would you mind signing a couple of baseballs for my boy?"
Homer,Just sign your name above President Lincoln's.
Homer,And I say a monkey can mow our lawn!
Homer,I stole a rack of fur coats. I sell one a year to pay for Christmas.
Homer,"Why, 'cause I'm fat?"
Homer,Like I always say: compromise is the key.
Homer,Let's compromise and say nobody said it.
Homer,"Hey Tabitha, great show. I like that part where you mentioned Springfield. Did you know that's where you are?"
Homer,"Oh, you're so hot."
Homer,If only I'd seen you before I met my wife.
Homer,Don't tell the hamburger in my car.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"So, why didn't you marry one of your crummy backup dancers?"
Homer,Oh yeah...
Homer,Thank God I brought protection.
Homer,I used to be so embarrassed buying these.
Homer,"Oh, we're gonna have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock."
Homer,Cancellations require twenty-four hours No-tice.
Homer,"Yeah, they beat me up at work. Look at the word they wrote on my skull."
Homer,I didn't want you to learn that word this way.
Homer,"Marge, we've gotta get Buck and Tabitha back together. This is the most important case of our careers!"
Homer,"Oh, so now we're judging each other based on things we've done. Real fair. Class act."
Homer,I'm going back to the stadium to bring those two kids back together. And I'll do it with or without you!
Homer,But I wanted to do it with you.
Homer,It's working! Buck's buying my fake message! And you said it would never work.
Homer,Uh... she was here a minute ago. She must be pooping.
Homer,Great. But enough of the baseball analogies. They sicken me.
Homer,"Now, m'lady, your carriage awaits."
Homer,"Wow, your paintings have brush marks and your statues have wieners!"
Homer,"He's talkin' like the guy in ""Fat Albert."" Howba areba youba?"
Homer,Whyba youba doba thatba?
Homer,"Mmm, this must be what angels taste like!"
Homer,Why can't you do anything?
Homer,"Dirt nap, eh? Hm..."
Homer,"Sorry, Marge, can't hear ya!"
Homer,This is all my daughter's fault. But I'll make it up to you. Bart and I will run your business till your Dad's okay.
Homer,"Everything. And I learned it all from the greatest gangster film ever: ""Shark Tale""."
Homer,Leave him to me.
Homer,Ow! I hurt my fist and my palm. I thought you guys were lookin' out for me.
Homer,"All right, tap jockey, you owe Fat Tony fifty bucks. Cough it up!"
Homer,Just get the money.
Homer,"Okay. Take it, take it! Just don't hurt me!"
Homer,"Okay pretty boy, where's Fat Tony's fifty bucks?"
Homer,It'll do for now.
Homer,"Uh, it fell off a truck. You know, a truck-truck."
Homer,No problem. I'll be back in ten minutes.
Homer,You monster! Just cut his Achilles tendon with this knife.
Homer,But this is the only life I know!
Homer,Can I still talk with my hands?
Homer,What about with my ears?
Homer,Lady. Man. Lady. Man. Lady.
Homer,"Hey, if I poisoned them, would I be doing this?"
Homer,"Marge, could you let it go? You won. She's dead!"
Homer,"Yeah, put a leash on him, lady!"
Homer,Spare us your medical mumbo-jumbo! Just give us the pills. Clear-cut his brain down to the nub!
Homer,"Thank you, Doctor. Marge?"
Homer,I've never seen him happier.
Homer,I know -- I'll use that white-noise machine I got you when your father died.
Homer,"Transport yourself to the shores of Nova Scotia, where cod and halibut frolic in--"
Homer,"So it's a noise war he wants, huh? Then I'll throw in some rush-hour traffic!"
Homer,And a circus fire!
Homer,"Sleep tight, my angel!"
Homer,What?!
Homer,"Oh! Let me know when and if you want sex, honey!"
Homer,"Boy, get dressed. You're going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket you're making!"
Homer,I'm sending you mixed messages! Now get the Hell outta here!
Homer,I love you so much. Damn you!
Homer,"Woo hoo! What's next? A contract with Groove-tone Records? Take the G-train, baby. Groove-tone!"
Homer,"Oh, son. I like you more, now that other people like you."
Homer,And then today at lunch Lenny and I went to the park and rented a rowboat. Carl sketched us from the bank. Summer days.
Homer,And what about my new job as a Mexican wrestler?
Homer,Beware of el Taco Belly!
Homer,No mas! No mas!
Homer,"Not if I can help it, Lisa!"
Homer,"Uh, no. sorry if it sounded like I did."
Homer,I guess.
Homer,Deal!
Homer,"Ooh, gummy worms!"
Homer,Don't tell me how many times to think!
Homer,Then stand back!
Homer,This doesn't taste like I thought it would.
Homer,We already own a book!
Homer,"Cool, a carpenter's library!"
Homer,"This doesn't look easy, but I'll bet it is."
Homer,"Oh yeah? Blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah..."
Homer,"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah..."
Homer,"Okay, now you do me."
Homer,I did! I made a foot rest.
Homer,What's the point? We're all slowly dying.
Homer,"You sure are, sweetie -- I love this bed you made."
Homer,"Yep, it'll do that."
Homer,Simpsons Manly-Man Handyman at your service.
Homer,No problem. Why don't you go inside and stir your flubber while I get to work.
Homer,"Marge, the coast is clear."
Homer,"Oh, uh, that was me. You know that old saying: ""measure like a girl, hammer like a guy."""
Homer,"Oh, uh... you know what they say, ""hammer with the wood and it's all good."""
Homer,It's allll good.
Homer,...Annnd done.
Homer,Listen... what would you say if I told you a woman did most of the work?
Homer,"Uh... Like all manly men, I have a vivid imagination."
Homer,Mmm... extra-virgin...
Homer,"Of course I can make a credenza, whatever that is. Just give all the details to my secretary Shirley."
Homer,That Shirley is quite a gal. We should fix her up with Barney.
Homer,"Marge, giving me credit was your idea. Now could you rub my butt? I sat on it so much it's a little sore."
Homer,"Look, I'm sorry you're upset. But if we tell the truth now, I'll be humiliated in front of the whole town. Then you won't be married to a man. You'll be married to some kind of gay jellyfish, floating outside the Florida Keys, cruising for rich snorkelers. You don't want that."
Homer,He wants to grind his own corn. Maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal.
Homer,Switch!
Homer,"Who'd you think would help me, my wife? Heh."
Homer,"Yeah, I hear it too. Maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song. ""WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU..."""
Homer,"...I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, infinity. I never expected them to climb on the cabinet and ride it down the biggest hill in town."
Homer,"Look, I understand that you're mad. Which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old Springfield roller coaster."
Homer,"By the way, nice job installing this wall-chart bracket. If the kids ask, I did it."
Homer,"Now as I see it, the problem with this roller coaster is there are too many boring ""going-up"" parts."
Homer,"We need to replace them with kick-ass ""going-down"" parts."
Homer,Hmm... let me mull that over.
Homer,What are struts?
Homer,I don't know anything about struts.
Homer,And I promised these guys money I don't have! And they're gonna be so mad!
Homer,Maybe I can sneak home without them seeing me.
Homer,"Sweetie, you don't understand. If I can do this myself, then all those lies I told will be true. Don't you want Daddy's lies to be true?"
Homer,"To Daddy, the real world gets fainter and fainter every day."
Homer,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, and out-of-town roller-coaster weirdoes."
Homer,And now I give you... the Zoominator!
Homer,And now to get stinking drunk!
Homer,"Sure, I'll tell them the truth..."
Homer,The truth is that I'm perfect and everything I touch is perfect!
Homer,I've never felt saferrrr!
Homer,Uh-oh. Oh. Why must we preserve America's historic roller coasters?
Homer,Thank you honey!
Homer,Everyone! My stupid male pride made me lie to you. Everything I claiiimed I did was actually built by Maaarge!
Homer,Avenge me!
Homer,"Marge, I realized something when I was trapped under all that rubble: marriage is the real roller coaster. I'm just glad I have you as my safety bar."
Homer,"Hey, that's great. Let's look at it after."
Homer,You always find an excuse not to make out.
Homer,"Ooh, a space marshmallow!"
Homer,Where do you think you're going?
Homer,"If he's so smart, how come he can't stay outta my mouth?"
Homer,"Marge, I ate it, it's over."
Homer,Oh no you don't!
Homer,If I can keep down Arby's I can keep down you!
Homer,"Must eat, then poop, then eat some more, then eat while pooping."
Homer,Still hungry.
Homer,Son! Let me have a lick at you.
Homer,"Nag, nag, nag."
Homer,"Uh, no. Just gas."
Homer,"Ooh, teenagers... No! Today's teens have enough problems, without me eating them."
Homer,I'll savor you!
Homer,No.
Homer,Beer-battered Germans...
Homer,Must eat more fat people. Thank God I'm in America!
Homer,I used to think these shirts were just for fat slobs.
Homer,Dr. Phil McGraw!
Homer,"You're right. Starting tomorrow, no bread before dinner."
Homer,"That's ridiculous, talking fudge."
Homer,Marge! I missed you! All this eating has put me in the mood for a little lovin'.
Homer,"Well, back to the drawing board."
Homer,"What happened to ""for better or for worse?!"""
Homer,It's amazing. He tastes just like Jeffrey Tambor.
Homer,"Marge, to keep you in my life, I'd do anything. There must be some way to turn my problem into a positive for the community."
Homer,"Bart, there's something I have to tell you father to son. I passed out on your turtle and killed it. Someday you'll thank me."
Homer,"Hey, Milhouse."
Homer,What's goin' on?
Homer,"Hey boy, where's your mud buddy? I have a little job for him."
Homer,"Yeah, get him a woman. That'll end his misery!"
Homer,This hurts so much.
Homer,Writing's for nerds.
Homer,"Hey, I'm not done dancin'! This bulletin better swing!"
Homer,Flanders?
Homer,"So, it's a war of the worlds. Good thing we've got the sun on our side."
Homer,"Go ahead and hide, you coward!"
Homer,Burn everything!
Homer,That's alien talk!
Homer,I'm proud of what I achieved during my rioting.
Homer,It was either kill him or kill no one!
Homer,"Lisa, that was just a radio show."
Homer,"Eh, big deal -- by the time Bart's eighteen, we're gonna control the world! We're China, right?"
Homer,"Sorry, guys. You know, his mother's the one who made me come down here."
Homer,Go on.
Homer,Wouldn't that take me away from my family for two whole years?
Homer,Woo hoo! Where do I sign?
Homer,Now where's my parade? Where's my parade?
Homer,"Ooh, ""Who makes what in America."" Army private: fourteen thousand a year."
Homer,I have to Marge. Who else is gonna keep oil under a hundred dollars a barrel?
Homer,You? Don't make me laugh! You couldn't--
Homer,"Aw, no, daddy's just teasing. Of course you could. You could keep it under a hundred. Yes, you could."
Homer,No she couldn't.
Homer,Are you gonna ask us our major malfunctions? 'Cause mine is I care too much.
Homer,Snowflake?! What happens to me in the summer?
Homer,I don't understand. How does punishing them teach me a lesson?
Homer,"Man, you've got an awesome voice."
Homer,"Can you say ""Side effects may include drowsiness and loss of appetite?"""
Homer,"Hm, sounded better in my head."
Homer,Everyone got an assignment but us.
Homer,I wonder what makes us so special.
Homer,That's an odd way to start handing out medals.
Homer,Are we that stupid?
Homer,Nope. I'm gonna stay here and let them test their laser-guided super weapons on me -- like that one!
Homer,"Okay, these are war games and I'm head of my team. I have to think like a great military leader."
Homer,I will!
Homer,"Stay crunchy, men! Stay crunchy!"
Homer,"Oh my God, I just remembered. It's Chinese New Year!"
Homer,Gung hay fat choi! Gung hay fat choi!
Homer,Americans!
Homer,"Bring it on, chumps!"
Homer,"Fingers, fingers, fingers!"
Homer,"Moe, Moe, you gotta hide us from the Army!"
Homer,"Not that Army, the one from ""Stripes!"""
Homer,"Thanks, Moe. How can I ever repay you?"
Homer,"Well, what have we got?"
Homer,Rise my pretties! Find our enemies and capture their image in your filmy fortress!
Homer,I'm not gonna surrender. You've seen what the U.S. Army does to prisoners. How would you like to be stacked naked in a pile with a hillbilly girl pointing at you and laughing?
Homer,"Yeah, Marge always loves your cards. Well, you may not be the smartest guys in the Army..."
Homer,"H means ""hot""?!"
Homer,"Stupid Army, searching for me with that giant helicopter in the distance."
Homer,Predator drone!
Homer,Hmm... Let's see what your hangover has to say!
Homer,"Dudes! Wanna make some extra spending money? Get a free pair of boots? Hey baby, you like obstacle courses?"
Homer,"Thinking it over, huh? I'm cool with that."
Homer,"Hey, pal. Like the way you handle that mop. You like killing? Hey, ladies. Are you tired of waiting for sanctions to work? I know I am."
Homer,Hmm... I must be supposed to remember something.
Homer,"C'mon, memory, wake up!"
Homer,"Is it our anniversary? No, we don't have one this year. Hmmm..."
Homer,Don't forge? Don't forge what?
Homer,"Ohhh, don't forget. Don't forget what?!"
Homer,The Senior Olympics? That's what I was supposed to remember?!
Homer,Too late. The deed is done.
Homer,This guy sucks. He can barely make it to the top.
Homer,"Oh, I was supposed to take Moe fishing today! Everybody hide!"
Homer,Says you.
Homer,"Whoa, Marge, who'd you piss off?"
Homer,"Moe, you live in a hotel? You're just like ""Eloise""!"
Homer,This vibrating massage chair feels great!
Homer,"Oooh, Moe's a poet! He has a soul! Flutter your wings! It's teatime in Buttercup Junction!"
Homer,Moe's the Princess of Lollipop Land! He lunches on lavender and potpourri!
Homer,"Seriously Moe, I think you have a gift."
Homer,"Ooh, you love a man!"
Homer,Do not mention that publication in this house! They never published my poem!
Homer,"There once was a rapping tomato / That's right, I said rapping tomato / He rapped all day / From April to May / And also, guess what, it was me."
Homer,"Ah, a family trip with the family bartender -- what could be better?"
Homer,Lousy. I gotta go to Vermont for some stupid poetry thing.
Homer,Fine. I'll drive between sips.
Homer,"They got an open bar at this thing, right?"
Homer,Wow. Troopers from every state in New England.
Homer,It's gonna be awesome!
Homer,"Man, couples in this state sure like to clink glasses."
Homer,"Hey, thanks for the heads-up! We'll see ya when we see ya!"
Homer,I love these covered bridges. It's like driving through cute little houses.
Homer,Oh I'm sorry. We should exchange insurance information. I have none.
Homer,"And we went to the ""Vermont Teddy Bear"" factory. Look what we got! Hm? Hm?"
Homer,"Oh honey, don't cry. They're not made from real bears -- just their fur and noses!"
Homer,No one makes my daughter sob and run.
Homer,"Make my daughter cry, will ya! Eat syrup, jerk!"
Homer,"No, not now."
Homer,"Hmmm... maple syrup. Sleigh on the label, very good."
Homer,"Rich maple color, good swirl..."
Homer,"Oh, Jemima!"
Homer,I'm the king of goofing off!
Homer,I thought we were playing Cincinnati Time-Waste.
Homer,What'd I do?
Homer,"Hey Marge, want a thousand dollars?"
Homer,You're not ice cream... faker!
Homer,Ice cream man! Wait!
Homer,Ice cream man! Ice cream man!
Homer,"One butter-crusted choco-rocket, please."
Homer,"Yeah, this economy is tough on everyone. Change a hundred?"
Homer,Nooooo!
Homer,Max told you about me?
Homer,This is the most fun I've ever had giving you wood.
Homer,"Wait a minute. You don't want the truck, I need a job, you need money, I'm flush with severance pay..."
Homer,"Why, doesn't he need it? Oh, right."
Homer,Remember that crappy ice cream truck I bought?
Homer,"Well, sink your crooked rotting teeth into this!"
Homer,He was following my design.
Homer,And now to get dressed in a most unusual way:
Homer,Butter-brickle!
Homer,You kids like ice cream?
Homer,"What's the matter, son? Don't you have enough money for ice cream?"
Homer,"Son, I will not stand for intolerance!"
Homer,You give this delightful frozen treat the same respect you would give any lactose-free food. God bless America!
Homer,"I said, God bless America!"
Homer,Ooh! Thomeone wearth a brathelet. Who'th your boyfriend? Dr. Osterberg?!
Homer,"Whoa Marge, for the first time in my life, I'm excited about going to work!"
Homer,You're glad? You don't look glad. Are you sure you know what glad means?
Homer,Love you!
Homer,"Marge, I... Folk art!? That's my favorite kind of folk medium!"
Homer,"Marge, you're a genius. You should make sculptures of other people! Like Lenny, or Carl, or the new James Bond. Will America accept a British James Bond? I can't wait to find out!"
Homer,"Honey, I brought you more sticks."
Homer,It's good to see you smile again. I was lonely being happy all by myself.
Homer,Let me just put on some romantic music.
Homer,"Hey, we got the whole night, baby -- let's slow things down."
Homer,"Marge, everything looks wonderful!"
Homer,"Well, I'm off to pedal my frosty wares!"
Homer,"Sweetie, I can't abandon my route even for one day. If those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, I am screwed. But I'll be back in time for your show."
Homer,"I would never let you down. Our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. And trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. In cone-clusion, here's the scoop: I love you."
Homer,"What the hell do you kids want? Oh right, ice cream."
Homer,Oh my God! It's the opportunity of a lifetime!
Homer,"Attention, losers: this is your chance to buy your kids some frozen love."
Homer,"Sorry, I'm all out of ice cream."
Homer,Marge's show!
Homer,Must jettison excess weight!
Homer,"Oh my God, I've only got nine seconds till Marge's show!"
Homer,I'll never make it! Unless...
Homer,Woo hoo! I'm gonna be on time!
Homer,"I made it back for your show, honey..."
Homer,"Marge, let me explain: I had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families..."
Homer,Well excuse me for having enormous flaws that I don't work on!
Homer,Marge? Marge?
Homer,"Honey, you've been in there all day. You gotta eat something. Why don't you come downstairs and cook dinner? Lasagna would be awesome. Marge?"
Homer,"Marge, I wrote you a check for three hundred dollars to pay for all the sculptures I broke. Okay?"
Homer,"Oh, I see. You'd prefer a wire transfer. What's your routing number?"
Homer,"That's okay, I can get it from the bank, honey. I just need to know your birthday."
Homer,"Marge? I have an apology that I hope is better than all the other ones. So please listen carefully. The thing I liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love I received from obese children. It was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art."
Homer,"If it would win you back, I would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle. I hope it doesn't come to that. Could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little?"
Homer,"If you won't talk to me, I'll send in Polaroids to show you how sad I am that I let you down."
Homer,"I'm laughing in the last one, but it's only 'cause the cat fell down the stairs."
Homer,Marge?
Homer,Marge?
Homer,"Marge, where are you? Did you change your name? Is it Kelly? Kelly!!!"
Homer,"Oh my God. She's gonna jump. Marge, don't do it! Give divorce a chance!"
Homer,The world's not that interested!
Homer,Wow! You made me a sculpture of Magilla Gorilla.
Homer,"I just have one question, my darling: what did you do with all the ice cream that was on all those sticks?"
Homer,Yeah? Well I wish I'd married Patty and Selma!
Homer,You used to love it!
Homer,Recording that fake fight was a great idea.
Homer,"And, as always, have fun watching."
Homer,GOOOO... LOVEMAKING!
Homer,"And I hate the cutesy way you make Jack-o-lanterns! I like scary Halloween, not funny Halloween!"
Homer,"Oh, your elbow's like an angel's kiss. But you still have to go."
Homer,"Son, we all have to do things we don't want to. Like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be Mr. Funny all the time -- You think I wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? Like some ancient pagan! Just dancing around playing the pan flute! And here we are!"
Homer,Too late.
Homer,Yeah. How'd you afford this kick-ass party?
Homer,Woo hoo! Marital sex!
Homer,"Okay, tucked in tight, glass of water, nightlight on, no barn owls, don't do drugs, love you, good night."
Homer,But your mother smells like coconut!
Homer,"Okay sweetie, which book should I read?"
Homer,"Oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. Broken, lonely grownups."
Homer,Chapter One: The RubyStone in the Door-Portal. Are you asleep yet?
Homer,Angelica trembled as she looked up at the stern but wise whiskers of Headmaster Greystash...
Homer,"Lisa, wake up! They're taking Angelica to Mount Purgatorium."
Homer,Tomorrow? But she's in trouble now! I'll just read ahead without you.
Homer,"Oh, of course. Whatever you say, sweetie. Nighty-night."
Homer,"Lisa, I'm home! Time for me to read to you!"
Homer,"Lady, you're nice, but I'm married."
Homer,Ow! I can't read ahead -- I promised Lisa I wouldn't!
Homer,An Unexpected Occurrence?! What could it be?!
Homer,Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...
Homer,...As Headmaster Greystash fought a battle to the finish with dark wizard Maluicious Krubb.
Homer,He killed Greystash!
Homer,"Oh, Greystash. Greystash! Oh, hello, Lisa."
Homer,Uh... how would you feel if something bad happened to Greystash?
Homer,Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...
Homer,Greystash looked Krubb right in the eye and said...
Homer,The end.
Homer,"Uh, they went to Star Wars Land and fought star wars."
Homer,Now Lisa won't know about death till it strikes someone close to her.
Homer,Greystash! Greystash!
Homer,Don't say his name! In your mouth it sounds like dirt!
Homer,No man should outlive his fictional wizard! No man!
Homer,"Just think, Lisa, if I had paid for those skating lessons, that could've been you!"
Homer,Look out! It's the Grumple!
Homer,"Give back that Holiday Cheer, you bastard!"
Homer,"You're getting a cab, old man. In fact, I believe I see it now."
Homer,Your present is leaving.
Homer,"Marge, we have a problem here."
Homer,Do you think that's the same Grumple from the ice show? Because I do.
Homer,Why did you let that loser into our home?
Homer,Christian Charity? What does a porn star have to do with this? He's gotta go!
Homer,Really? Who's gonna make him?
Homer,He sure has a lot of markers that don't work.
Homer,"Don't worry, I make six of those a year."
Homer,Lower the boom!
Homer,Has the boom been lowered?
Homer,We're not keeping that moocher in this house another minute!
Homer,"Oh, that's it -- we're changing doctors."
Homer,"Marge, admit it -- you just can't say ""no"" to anyone. That's why you have three kids."
Homer,Yes we are.
Homer,"Marge, I have no idea what you were just thinking about. Why would you think I did?"
Homer,"Yeah, but there's something else. There's this loser staying in our house. Marge says she's gonna kick him out, but then she never does."
Homer,"Well, I guess I'll have to wait for Marge to show some backbone and-- You again?!"
Homer,What the hell is this thing?
Homer,"Those legs go on forever. Oh wait, they stop right there."
Homer,A heart-shaped box of chocolates.
Homer,"For your information, since I bought it I put on a ton of weight."
Homer,Their drunken singing is ruining St. Patrick's day!
Homer,Scottsdale? Will we stay at a Tripletree Resort?
Homer,Then forget it!
Homer,Gunderson!
Homer,"And to think, he and I once shared a shower."
Homer,"A hundred and seventeen degrees! Ooo, that reminds me."
Homer,There's water under the seat!
Homer,"Now remember, Marge, we're not buying anything for more than one-point-two. But if I scratch my nose, that means we can go to one-point-five."
Homer,I've never seen Marge want to go somewhere so badly. I'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a DVD.
Homer,I've never seen Marge like a DVD about a place so much. I'm gonna make her dream come true... by downloading that movie onto her iPod.
Homer,"Marge, I'm sorry I couldn't figure out how to get that movie onto your iPod... so I'm taking the family on a surprise vacation to Barnacle Bay!"
Homer,We left plenty of food so you won't starve.
Homer,I was talking to the cat!
Homer,"Oh Marge, I'm sure it was just some guy filled with hate."
Homer,You could caramel my arm...
Homer,"I didn't say ""stop."""
Homer,"It's not sugar, it's caramel!"
Homer,I bet it was Bill Clinton's fault.
Homer,Slick Willie wiggles out of another one.
Homer,"Oh, I can't stand to see your mother unhappy. But this town could be great for your mother again. And I know three people who can make it happen."
Homer,"Nice brush work, Emily. Nathaniel, you could learn a lot from her."
Homer,"Oh Ma-arge, we have a surpri-ise! Come to the win-dow! And look down at the stre-et!"
Homer,"Oh, they're getting a little exercise."
Homer,"All night long, baby."
Homer,"Blue pinwheel, red pinwheel, big white ball, wait for the ""aaahhh..."""
Homer,"A green spinner to build suspense... and then the big finale, the:"
Homer,"Oh, so, forming an angry mob, eh? Who we goin' after?"
Homer,I think the hook is touching my brain. .
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,Queer strange or queer gay?
Homer,How many yum-yum fish did we get?
Homer,"Ew, it tastes terrible!"
Homer,"Finally. Something even I wouldn't eat. Well, maybe a little more."
Homer,Terrible.
Homer,Here you go -- beer-battered shrimp.
Homer,"Uh... I thought today was Opposite Day. By the way, you're very ugly. It's Opposite Day."
Homer,So that means... it is Opposite Day.
Homer,I don't know what to say.
Homer,"Dear Marge, how are you? I am fine. The waves here are way bigger than the ones at home. And the salt water is rising. What's next? Pepper water? Ha ha. Love ya, Homer Simpson."
Homer,Bart!? What the hell are you doing in there?!
Homer,"Aw, son."
Homer,"You did the right thing, boy."
Homer,Watch me drive a golf ball off the bow!
Homer,Yeahhhh!
Homer,Shiiiii... pwreck!
Homer,"Uh... sure we will, son. Right, Captain?"
Homer,Should I hit him with a shovel to spare him the pain of drowning?
Homer,What's the code word?
Homer,"Oh mother sea -- giver of fish, taker of boats, toilet to the world, the Greeks called you Poseidon, the Romans... Aquaman. Look into thy starfish heart and protect our souls, so we might live to go tubing on thee again."
Homer,Do you think your Mother will ever remarry?
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,The hell we are!
Homer,"Well, handsome here was in big trouble...when suddenly..."
Homer,Oh my God! It's beautiful!
Homer,Wait a minute. How am I breathing?
Homer,Then when all seemed lost...
Homer,I can't go back to living on the surface world! I can't!
Homer,Then they brought us home...
Homer,"So, that's our story. Oh wait, we were attacked by a giant whale. He turned out to be pretty cool."
Homer,Ah! Nothin' beats taking a family drive with our new satellite radio.
Homer,Which of the twenty-five easy-listening stations should we listen to?
Homer,You're all idiots. I'm putting it on Chill Thunder Lite.
Homer,Hey! Nobody cuts me off!
Homer,How's it goin'?
Homer,Then what's America doing in Iraq?
Homer,May we? May we? Mais oui!
Homer,"Treason?! But I love France! The way all our words are either a girl or a guy! Oh, that's the best!"
Homer,I don't want the kids to see me this way!
Homer,"I didn't write that! Even if I did love England, I'd play it cool. Wait for it to come to me."
Homer,You moron! I'm already alive!
Homer,"I shouldn't be here, I was framed!"
Homer,Are you gonna torture me?
Homer,Nine a.m.?!
Homer,I swear revenge on Meaux! Even if it takes me the rest of my life! Can you loosen my arm so I can shake my fist?
Homer,REVENGE! Okay.
Homer,"Oh, little mouse, you are the only thing that keeps me sane."
Homer,Now I have nothing.
Homer,Where did you come from?
Homer,"Oh sorry, I wasn't listening. I was checking out my reflection in this yellow water. Lookin' good."
Homer,And decrepit.
Homer,"Oooh, the the! But why are you helping me?"
Homer,"So this map leads to a treasure, huh?"
Homer,I wonder how long this tunnel...
Homer,...iiiiiis!
Homer,Mon Dieu! Weee!
Homer,Ew! Silver!
Homer,"Ooh, a penny!"
Homer,This is my lucky day.
Homer,"Madame, you have the shapely, hairless knuckles of a queen."
Homer,"Monsieur Meaux, I would be honored if you would be the first to enjoy the evening's entertainment."
Homer,Here it is: The Harmless Chair of Relaxation!
Homer,Little do you know that the Count of Monte Cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours.
Homer,I have returned!
Homer,Oh. Hold on.
Homer,Oui oui! And I have spent the last five years plotting the most exquisite revenge!
Homer,"Yes, my love?"
Homer,You guys liked him?
Homer,"But Marge, I did it all for you!"
Homer,"It takes time to make a revenge machine this awesome! Plus, in the middle, I had to take revenge on some of my contractors."
Homer,"Oh, right -- revenge!!"
Homer,"I'm gonna get my revenge! And if I get caught, I'm pinning it on the baby like the time I shot Mr. Burns."
Homer,"Is it ""The Count of Monte Cristo?"" 'Cause I love that story."
Homer,Wow. That had what I really like in a story: an ending.
Homer,"No, sweetie. The lesson is: never put down your weapon."
Homer,Revenge!
Homer,"This is it. It's taken all day, we've missed our flight to Hawaii, but finally, I'll get my revenge."
Homer,You? You're too dumb to tell a story.
Homer,"No, seriously, you're great -- let's hear it."
Homer,"Parents who are still alive, I might add."
Homer,You don't frighten me!
Homer,Or my wife!
Homer,Or my...
Homer,Avenge me. In flamboyant impractical fashion.
Homer,"That's okay, boy. The two of us got to talking."
Homer,Two.
Homer,I don't know. Let's just lay here till we figure it out.
Homer,Now what do they want?
Homer,Camera's broken!
Homer,"Oh, I can't believe this day is already here: me taking you for your first driving lesson."
Homer,"Hey, that jerk cut us off! Pull alongside!"
Homer,"Eat Marshall Tucker, idiot!"
Homer,Floor it!
Homer,"Whoa, you just blew my mind!"
Homer,What's your hurry?
Homer,"Aw, my little girl's just like CBS News."
Homer,"Hold on there, boy. If you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight."
Homer,This cell phone is so I can call you whenever I need your driving services. I've put in my own ring tone!
Homer,"Hello, Bart?"
Homer,"I need you to go the gas station. Tell them you need to inflate your tires, but actually you inflate these volleyballs."
Homer,Then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion.
Homer,Bart... buddy! It's your dad! I need a ride! I think I'm in Chinatown. Not our Chinatown.
Homer,"Boy, I don't wanna freak you out, but I'm calling from inside the trunk."
Homer,That was me. Some very un-cool people put me in here.
Homer,It's dark in here!
Homer,Bart! This is a matter of life and death: What is the difference between ketchup and catsup?
Homer,They're gonna cut my head offff...!
Homer,"You know, my great-great grandmother was an Indian. I guess I should've mentioned that before, huh?"
Homer,Simpson men get the job done!
Homer,"It's a tragedy, a real tragedy. I mean, what kind of tramp gets knocked up before she's even married?"
Homer,"I mean in this day and age, when the link between sex and pregnancy has been proven so... conclusively in... scientific American, where..."
Homer,Actually... that was me.
Homer,"Why would I go to Utah? I love booze, caffeine, and monogamy."
Homer,Did she mention she was knocked up?
Homer,Oops. Sorry for the spoiler.
Homer,"Yeah, how 'bout that?"
Homer,"Son, one day you're going to be a great father."
Homer,"Thanks, boy. Hey, for old time's sake, you wanna drive me around while I sing public domain songs out the window?"
Homer,I will! I will be rich! I'll own a football team and a basketball team and I'll make them play baseball!
Homer,"Stop it, Winston!"
Homer,The light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea.
Homer,Eh?
Homer,Hm... what's changed for me since the last time I saw you? Only... everything!
Homer,Why do you sound so shocked? This is our fifth take.
Homer,"Now that I'm super-wealthy, I can buy them whatever their hearts desire. That's why rich kids turn out so well."
Homer,"You see Declan, I made my millions with a simple invention -- ""The Condiment Pen""!"
Homer,"Just click the buttons at the top and you can choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, and relish."
Homer,I got the idea from the regular pen.
Homer,"I don't know. You can put horseradish on your dead mother for all I care. The point is, I'm rich, rich, rich! Just look -- my dog has his own Jacuzzi!"
Homer,He loves it!
Homer,"Uh, this is Eduardo, my pool boy. He thinks he's an angry rich man."
Homer,That's the pool chemicals talking.
Homer,"Please, Mr. Burns, pretend you work for me. You can have the boy, just don't beat him. You can beat him, just don't leave marks."
Homer,I'll tell you why.
Homer,"It's been another eight years, and what do I have? Same job, same house, same dirty joke book..."
Homer,I just thought for once I could be the cool guy in your movie. But all I am is the guy who makes everyone else look good.
Homer,I'll pay for most of this!
Homer,"All right, you lured me to your bay. Now what sick game are you playing?"
Homer,"Oh, spirit. Are you gonna show me my future? My snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? Well, it's not too late for me to change!"
Homer,"You there, boy! Buy me a Christmas goose! The biggest one in the shop!"
Homer,Wow. I have a pretty good life after all.
Homer,"Relax, Marge. I wasn't gonna kill him."
Homer,"All those years I was dreaming of other things, I was actually doing what I really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking!"
Homer,"Marge, you're my real dream come true. And I get to live you every day."
Homer,"Relax, baby. While you were dreaming of me and calling me ""James,"" I took care of everything."
Homer,"Eh, stumbled home at dawn, same diff. Now don't worry: I packed everyone's lunches and sent them off into the world."
Homer,"Look boy, nobody knows better than me that you're a lost cause. But the school's paying for five sessions and there's a Chinese restaurant next door where I can get drunk."
Homer,He's lying!
Homer,Look at those dumb hillbillies! I bet they don't even know what... something is.
Homer,Look at those morons -- they sing because they're stupid!
Homer,Permission to moan?
Homer,"Okay, everyone, straight ahead is my big surprise!"
Homer,Look out for the stairs!
Homer,"Marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. Because I've got a plan..."
Homer,"I'd like to declare bankruptcy, please!"
Homer,"Yes I do. Under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets."
Homer,"What the? But I thought bankruptcy was the cool law! The one that says ""Dude, don't worry about it. I got this."""
Homer,"Of course, you idiot, 'cause I'm wishing for more money."
Homer,"I've got three bathrooms, don't I? Next."
Homer,"Give it here, I'll find some fat we can trim. Here you go, a giant useless expense for something that no one is interested in."
Homer,"No, no. This place is too expensive. I saw you doing a ""five-hundred piece"" jigsaw puzzle in there!"
Homer,"Come on, Dad, I'm cuttin' back everywhere. To save gas I'm ""Flintstone-ing"" the car."
Homer,Yabba... dabba... dooooo...
Homer,Why are you telling me? He's your father-in-law.
Homer,"Sure, but I think you're exaggerating the problem."
Homer,"What are you doing here, Patty-or-Selma?"
Homer,He was a great Dad! Every year he got so mad when Santa didn't bring me presents.
Homer,"Well, here we are, home early."
Homer,A bear is eating my father!
Homer,A talking bear is eating my father!
Homer,"Dad, do you know what you were kissing? Do you? Do you?"
Homer,"Well I never, ever want to see that again."
Homer,"Oh, why did I borrow that roof from him?"
Homer,It's not right. It's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane.
Homer,"Oh, now you're dragging hot dogs into this. Real classy, Marge. Real classy."
Homer,How could my Dad go out with Selma? Don't those two gargoyles know that love is for good-looking young people?
Homer,"Words hurt, you know."
Homer,Stupid Selma and Grampa... how dare they find happiness?
Homer,Oh great. Who are you in love with? Bart?
Homer,"Okay, but I'm not good at details. Or the big picture. I also show up late, and drunk."
Homer,I've got a good feeling about this.
Homer,Selma!
Homer,"Hola, I am Esteban de la Sexface. That means Stephen of the Sexface."
Homer,Oh baby.
Homer,Dos Selmas? Ay-yi-yi!
Homer,I guess I always dreamed that my father would grow old alone.
Homer,"A thousand, eh?"
Homer,Nooooooo...
Homer,"Oh Lisa, that's one of those rumors you get off the internet."
Homer,"Hey Selma, want some rice?"
Homer,Spooky.
Homer,So... how long is Señor Homer out of town for?
Homer,Then I must flee!
Homer,Where is he? Where is he? I smell his aftershave!
Homer,Where is he? I know he's in here.
Homer,"I don't have to make a wish, because I already have this wonderful family. I wish for infinity hamburgers."
Homer,"Oh, I get it. These are those trick candles you can't blow out."
Homer,E-Z Blo...
Homer,This ends now!
Homer,Uh-huh... uh-huh...
Homer,I'll just focus on one area... How many did I get? None? That's cool.
Homer,Or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.
Homer,"Yeah, but uh-- One of those I dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but I was too embarrassed to admit it, so I set the house on fire. It feels good to tell the truth. No, I'm lying again, it feels bad."
Homer,Aw. Our kids used to be so cute!
Homer,Used to?!
Homer,"Oh, deal with it."
Homer,"Tick tock, sweetie."
Homer,I'm going with the cologne I wore on our first date.
Homer,"I don't know. Maybe the Krusty doll accidentally turned on the car's headlights, which focused on the cologne bottle, causing it to boil, and soon explode."
Homer,"Oh, Captain Janeway! Your mission ended too soon! Too soon..."
Homer,"Here I am on the space shuttle, orbiting Earth."
Homer,Marge! This isn't like you.
Homer,Moderately wealthy?
Homer,That's quite an offer -- can I discuss it with my wife?
Homer,Then I'll do it!
Homer,Krusty! How 'bout a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?
Homer,"How 'bout you, Gabbo?"
Homer,"Okay, how 'bout an autograph for my kids?"
Homer,"Okay boy, this is that snooty supermarket all the celebrities shop at. You're gonna help me ambush them. Look at this place. Imported beer? Seedless grapes? Chewing gum?"
Homer,The clown on this cereal box is just a person!
Homer,"Okay boy, do something annoying. But leave yourself room to build."
Homer,"Look at those celebrities: I've met them all, and yet they don't even acknowledge my existence."
Homer,"Oh, like you care, Betty White."
Homer,Her name is Marge.
Homer,"Oh, uh... she's looking very snappy!"
Homer,No problem. Hey Drederick!
Homer,Your hip hop CD was boastful and unnecessary!
Homer,What are the first three?
Homer,Okay.
Homer,I wanted to remember my place in the book I was reading.
Homer,"Boy, I never thought I'd have my own dark room."
Homer,"Well, then you could come over here and help daddy pour chemicals."
Homer,Kids. They always say they're not tired when they're the most tired of all.
Homer,That photo's mine. That photo's mine. That photo's mine.
Homer,"See Marge, everyone says they hate these magazines, but it's impossible to set them down."
Homer,Did I attach the harness?
Homer,If you don't mind!
Homer,Thank you!
Homer,Now to make a young woman's wedding day all about me!
Homer,"Up, up, and annoy!"
Homer,I also wreck bar mitzvahs!
Homer,"First Amendment rules, privacy drools!"
Homer,"Now Maggie, I had to use your car seat to hold the new TV Guide...so I'm gonna hang you from the mirror."
Homer,"He's trying to make me look like a bad father. Maggie, take the wheel!"
Homer,"Ten and two, Einstein!"
Homer,Can't I even have privacy here?!
Homer,How could you publish this? I thought we were friends!
Homer,And then he said he didn't want a twin because they'd just fight.
Homer,You're right -- I'm giving up photography...
Homer,And my own medicine!
Homer,"So long, anti-clotting agent!"
Homer,Clot-clot-clot-clot-clot!
Homer,Listen to 'em. They're on top of the world while I'm sittin' here pretending I have a stool.
Homer,All because of a bunch of stuff that happened.
Homer,You guys are right -- I should get back in the game. But I threw away my camera.
Homer,"Thanks, Moe!"
Homer,How do you want your comeuppance: eight by ten or wallet size?
Homer,Nothing.
Homer,Providing you celebrities do something for me.
Homer,I want you all to show some respect for the people who made you what you are. Sign an autograph or two... support a charity for something that hasn't happened to a member of your family... let one of us regular guys write a terrible children's book!
Homer,"Ooh, Papa John's."
Homer,What's wrong?
Homer,"Oh Marge, you gotta get on the net. It's got all the best conspiracy theories. Did you know that Hezbollah owns Little Dolly Snack Cakes? This stuff will rock your world."
Homer,Never!
Homer,Why don't I just put on a dress?!
Homer,"Not naked, I haven't."
Homer,...our duties as firemen.
Homer,"Hey, Lisa, self-conscious about your shins? In my day, girls were worried about their boobs."
Homer,"Wait, that's soccer? I always called it ""human foosball."" Would you like me to take you to your game?"
Homer,Do I have to?
Homer,"Did someone say ""snack""?"
Homer,I'll be your ref!
Homer,I got fired from Foot Locker.
Homer,"What'sa matter, buddy? The American flag not good enough for ya?"
Homer,I'm your father now.
Homer,I'm open! I'm open!
Homer,So... tired.
Homer,Could someone bring me another barf cone?
Homer,So... I thought it went real well. Until I swallowed the whistle.
Homer,Hilarious joke?
Homer,Hand ball! Direct kick!
Homer,"Thanks, honey. After what you said to me, I watched hours and hours of soccer. I almost saw a goal! But there were so many ads for Spanish cell phones..."
Homer,Foul on twenty-three!
Homer,I said foul on twenty-three!
Homer,Well I'm throwing you both out of the game!
Homer,"Foul on the other girl. Lisa gets a penalty kick, and every other kid has to pay her a dollar!"
Homer,She has not! Your daughter's a dirty player!
Homer,I don't need a soccer lecture from a hillbilly!
Homer,Ronaldo?! Winner of two World Cups and three FIFA player of the year awards?
Homer,Yellow card!
Homer,"When I put on these shorts, I'm not your father anymore. And judging by how tight they are, I'm never gonna be anyone else's either."
Homer,Un-sportsman-like conduct.
Homer,That's a red card. You're out of the game!
Homer,"Lisa, sweetie, I was just following the rules."
Homer,"Son, I'll never understand women if I live to be forty."
Homer,You said it -- enjoy me while I last.
Homer,Wanna watch me?
Homer,Lisa's mad at me and Marge is mad at him.
Homer,Yeah. What have you done with the real Moe?
Homer,"Lisa, honey, I bought you something. A DVD!"
Homer,It's a documentary... by the B.B.C... in cooperation with Canal Plus...
Homer,"Sweetie, are you here to forgive me?"
Homer,But to get that DVD I had to become a PBS subscriber! Now I'm paying for crap like American Masters!
Homer,Those places are pretty terrible.
Homer,I sure do.
Homer,Look what I can do!
Homer,"Oh, that's long gone, baby. Long gone."
Homer,"I got hung up at the snack stand -- watching those hot dogs rolling and turning, not a care in the world."
Homer,No more lazy Saturdays for you.
Homer,My son caught the ball! This makes up for everything that's gone wrong in my life or ever will!
Homer,"I hate shopping. I'm bored, my feet hurt, I'm too big for the choo-choo train... hmm, where's the ""husband chair?"""
Homer,There must be another chair.
Homer,I guess I could just sit on a bed...
Homer,Sure feels weird lying on top of the covers.
Homer,Sure feels weird lying in bed with my pants on.
Homer,How many?!
Homer,"Well, who wouldn't with an incredible mattress like this? It works with my body's natural curves and supports my back-boobs."
Homer,I don't work here.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"But it did happen. Just yesterday, in Crazytown."
Homer,Knock it off! He's just a kid!
Homer,"Hey, get off my case! He's the choke artist!"
Homer,"Marge, we were just talking about it a few seconds ago."
Homer,"Oh yeah, let's see where that goes."
Homer,"Let me tell you about a land where it rains beer and hails pretzels, and you can play swim-up blackjack with Abraham Lincoln! It's the land of sleep. And your passport: a simple mattress."
Homer,A common problem. Try this.
Homer,"Sex problem, eh?"
Homer,"Relax. I'm a licensed mattress professional, if there were such a thing. And I've got the answer to your problems -- the Snugulux, by Matrimonium!"
Homer,"And remember: your most intimate secrets are safe with me. Okay, who else is dead in bed?"
Homer,"The Lovejoys?! If this is about me drinking that holy water, let me tell you I had had like a million Doritos -- you know, the ones with the flame on the bag? Oh-ho, that bag ain't lyin'!"
Homer,What's wrong with it?
Homer,"Oh, I think I know what you're doing wrong. Have you tried..."
Homer,I'll write you a check.
Homer,Pay to the order of... Stupid Reverend... memo: bite my ass ... Wha?!
Homer,On one condition: you do the shlepping.
Homer,Move over just a...
Homer,"Wrong, wrong, wrong!"
Homer,"Yeah... something has changed, but I can't figure out what. Our mattress! I traded it to the Lovejoys!"
Homer,"It was made for Elvis, but he found it tacky."
Homer,I can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...
Homer,Lousy Reverend. He's having my sex! While I'm at home with Marge not doing anything sexual or erotic.
Homer,"Look, we're just gonna take our mattress, do a quick sweep of the medicine chest, then we're outta here."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"Well, excuse me, for being a powerful yet careless lover."
Homer,You would be.
Homer,Or a chicken club... or a Reuben... or a Monte Cristo... or a... Pull over behind that billboard!
Homer,"It's like our honeymoon all over again. Aw, we even have the same bum looking at us."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"I couldn't find Maggie's brand, but I got every other kind I could find. How about ""Syntho-Nip?"""
Homer,"Kiddy Cork? ""Thumbstitute?"" ""AccuTeat?"" ""Bink 182?"""
Homer,Wanna suck on the receipt?
Homer,"Good work, boy. Just for that, we're gonna treat your heart murmur, not just ""see how it goes."""
Homer,Stupid baby... growing her brain... on my dime!
Homer,Mm-hm.
Homer,"Okay Nappien, do your stuff."
Homer,"It's not working! You lousy, worthless piece of--"
Homer,"What a wonderful night's sleep. Thank you methasorbizone tartrate, also known as Nappien."
Homer,"That's ridiculous. If I had set up those dominoes, I'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads."
Homer,How is that possible?
Homer,Mood swings?! Mood swings. Mood swings!
Homer,"Mood swings? Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings, mood swings! Mood swings!"
Homer,"Nappien, you did it again! And everything is as it should be."
Homer,John Lennon?!
Homer,Yoko?
Homer,"Well son, your Uncle Homer is, like eighty percent of America, whacked-out on prescription drugs."
Homer,You're confusing drugs with druuuuugs.
Homer,"Okay, here's the solution -- I want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so I can't get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief."
Homer,Because I'm filled with stress!
Homer,I have three kids and no money! Why can't I have no kids and three money?
Homer,Zombie kill.
Homer,Zombie file grievance.
Homer,Mm-hm.
Homer,Zombie montage:
Homer,What the?! My car?! Milhouse?! Nutmeat?!
Homer,Oh my God! What have I done?!
Homer,"What are you, a travel agent? 'Cause you're sending me on a guilt trip."
Homer,I feel kinda responsible. Maybe I should volunteer to be a fireman.
Homer,"Oh, I can't wait for my first fire. Is that one?"
Homer,Is that one?
Homer,I can't! That fire siren could sound at any moment.
Homer,Any moment...
Homer,Any moment...
Homer,Did I say any moment?
Homer,Any moment...
Homer,What the hell is that?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Marge, when you see me next I'll be a soggy, smoky hero. Mmm, soggy, smoky hero."
Homer,Don't tell me how to do my job!
Homer,We don't get what?
Homer,Burns stiffed us!
Homer,"Hey, it's the least they can do after we saved them from being melty-faced weirdoes."
Homer,I hope it's spaghetti!
Homer,"Lousy burns so ungrateful, I hate him so much..."
Homer,Well... most of it.
Homer,And some stuff I wanted.
Homer,"Yeah, we're awesome. This'll make a great toilet seat!"
Homer,Just what are you getting at?
Homer,"Oh, thank God there's a fire. Marge's birthday's comin' up."
Homer,Look at me! I'm a fireman!
Homer,"Hey guys, check out the radical-free air generated by my stolen Ionic Breeze."
Homer,"Oh, bogus gizmo, grant me eternal life."
Homer,"Look at me, guys!"
Homer,"I'm stealing five Segways at once! And speaking of segues, I'm off to my next morally questionable activity!"
Homer,"We're not thieves, we're scavengers! Like the beautiful vulture, or the heroic tapeworm, or America's sweetheart, the maggot."
Homer,Make them stop!
Homer,"Moe, can we talk?"
Homer,"Moe, I think we may have perverted..."
Homer,"Moe, I can save you but you have to let go of the clock."
Homer,"So Daddy saved Apu and Moe, and believe me, we learned our lesson."
Homer,We sent it to skid row where it would do the most good.
Homer,"Oh man, I love Oktoberfest. Oktoberfest!"
Homer,You stuffed your horn?!
Homer,"Where the hell is Abigail Adams?! Oh, there she is. Where the hell is Mary Todd Lincoln?! Oh, she's right there. Where the hell is Ida Saxton McKinley?! Oh I see. Where the hell is--"
Homer,Betcha can't solve our maze? I didn't come here to be insulted. We're leaving!
Homer,Sure is a lot of corn in this parking lot.
Homer,"Split up?! Marge, no! We can fix this marriage!"
Homer,"Fine, you want out? Then go! I can make it on my own! Before I met you I had friends and dreams!"
Homer,Oh please take me back. The dating scene is a nightmare. I'm begging you!
Homer,"Deep down, I... I guess I knew that."
Homer,Of our marriage?! I don't want to live!
Homer,"Hey, this maze is made of corn!"
Homer,I'm so sick of being lost. To hell with maze etiquette! I'm walking straight outta here!
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,How come things that happen to stupid people keep happening to me?
Homer,I'm lost and I'm starving!
Homer,I don't have any holders!
Homer,"""To my wife Marge -- in case I don't make it, here are my Oscar picks for next year: Best Sound Effects Editing, the team from--"""
Homer,No. And never bring it up again.
Homer,All right.
Homer,"Now that he's had a taste of human flesh, the dog will be a slave to its succulence! Look at him eyeing me -- he knows I taste best."
Homer,"Oh relax, Marge, I'm just messin' with ya. I know I'm not a dog. I'm a people, like you."
Homer,"Cheer up, boy. We'll get you their most vicious street cur! He'll bite your ass raw!"
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not made of money!"
Homer,Why you little... I'll teach you to trick your sister!
Homer,"Well, I can breathe out okay."
Homer,Don't... give snake... attention... it's what... he really... wants.
Homer,I'm okay.
Homer,"Hey, get your own yogurt!"
Homer,Woo-hoo! Business trip!
Homer,"Apu, I'm returning a yogurt I wasn't a hundred per cent satisfied with."
Homer,"Hey Milhouse, who're you spying on? Those bullies?"
Homer,"Hey, lay off -- you're the fat one of you guys!"
Homer,I'm still alive! You call that playing to win?!
Homer,"This is our life now, Milhouse. We're dumpster folk."
Homer,"Say, is your butt numb from all this vibrating? Mine is. Still, I wouldn't describe it as unpleasant. Well, let's get some shut-eye."
Homer,"Ooh, it's that bar I like! Wait here in the car."
Homer,"Okay, Milhouse, what do you want to do?"
Homer,Ol' Betsy'll get us there.
Homer,Cops! Act natural!
Homer,"Hello, Officer!"
Homer,"Rice Krispie Treats? Way to phone it in, Sarah Wiggum!"
Homer,Can I have some more money?
Homer,All the other moms gave their husbands twenty.
Homer,"I had to fight! Lenny said his dad is Hulk Hogan, and I know he's not!"
Homer,You butcher!
Homer,"Ooh, a thermos! With seven cups of coffee still in it! Oh wait, six!"
Homer,Here! It's yours!
Homer,"Oh, I'm just glad you taste like hot dogs!"
Homer,"C'mon, everybody. Time for the family portrait. Let's bunch together now. Here we go."
Homer,Move it!
Homer,Perfecto. Everybody smile. I'm going to set the automatic timer.
Homer,Almost ready! Here we go.
Homer,"Okay, here we go."
Homer,What'd you say?
Homer,"All right, everybody. Squeeze in real tight."
Homer,I wanna get us all in the picture this time. Closer.
Homer,Closer.
Homer,Okay. Hold still. This is the last picture on the role.
Homer,You watch your mouth you little Smartass.
Homer,Nothing's gonna ruin this one. The timer's a tickin.
Homer,Bart!
Homer,This one's gonna be the Simpsons at our finest.
Homer,Smile. Look cheerful. Here we go...
Homer,Here we go... Here we go.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"Hey suckers, check it out. Marge is taking me to ride dirt bikes at the cemetery."
Homer,Why the cemetery? I wondered. But my dreams were too strong.
Homer,"Absolutely, all the time. I go to the floss store and they're like, ""Whoa, there he is again."" 'Cause I buy so much floss."
Homer,"Oh God, my gums! They hurt so much!"
Homer,"I know, but a breeze from that window went in my mouth."
Homer,I don't even have a special tooth problem! This is just a routine check-up! The bib is choking me!
Homer,It's over? That wasn't so bad.
Homer,This is the greatest movie ever!
Homer,I have a right to my views.
Homer,Sure do. Let's go get ice cream!
Homer,I'm gonna glue my mouth shut with butterscotch!
Homer,"What the hell is a ""fundae""?"
Homer,"I like that. But I'm on a bit of a health kick, so I'll take the low-fat vanilla... with the following mix-ins: Snickles, Gooey Bears, Charlottesville Chew, Nice 'N' Many, Kat Kit, Herschel's Smooches, Mrs. Bad Bar, and Milk Dudes."
Homer,Uh... cone!
Homer,"Oh my God, this is amazing! Wait, I'm gonna be driving. I'll go for the cup."
Homer,"Fine, cone."
Homer,What's this?!
Homer,"America West, please."
Homer,That's me!
Homer,"I've never been to war, but I imagine it feels just like your first kill. The happiness swept me away!"
Homer,"Well, the important thing is we got through this crisis together. That makes us friends, right?"
Homer,Okay.
Homer,The happiness swept me away!
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Marge, the couch is lumpy!"
Homer,Kent Brockman!
Homer,"I'm sorry Marge, but I won't live under the same roof as a member of the ""liberal media""."
Homer,Did you know that every day Mexican gays sneak into this country and unplug our brain-dead ladies?
Homer,"Oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!"
Homer,"I'm willing to change my mind, and that makes me great. You can stay. But you have to give us an eight-by-ten for our Wall of Casual Acquaintances Who Came to Stay For A While."
Homer,Apu sang a song. What are you gonna do?
Homer,What a great show: real people with real problems!
Homer,Liberals -- I hate them so much!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Liberals!
Homer,Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals!
Homer,Woo--
Homer,Hoo!
Homer,Woo hoo? Liberals? Woo hoo?
Homer,True -- but there's room for the truth in this household. Do you wanna hear something really bad Kent told me about the Fox network?
Homer,"I know, 'cause this one's really, really bad. For years now, Fox has been--"
Homer,I'm afraid they might. But I will not be silenced. The truth is...
Homer,"Okay. What I was going to say, was..."
Homer,"Hey, you're not a penny."
Homer,Me? But that's you!
Homer,Uh-huh. See you at five then.
Homer,"Dinner with Mr. Burns! What a waste of my precious, precious Saturday night."
Homer,He is not my boyfriend!
Homer,I do.
Homer,My favorite is Chicago deep dish.
Homer,Drive to Chicago? I don't have time for that. I have to be back at work on Monday. And my boss is a total jerk.
Homer,A P-P-P-P-P-Private jet!
Homer,"Yeah, but I'm on a plane, idiot."
Homer,I'm aroused and confused.
Homer,This is wonderful.
Homer,"Oh my God... Lionel Richie?! Can you sing ""Say You Say me,"" but make it about beer?"
Homer,"Now make every word ""beer."""
Homer,"BEER BEER, BEER BEER / BEER BEER BEER BEER BEER..."
Homer,"Um, wait, I forgot the words."
Homer,"No! If I leave the plane, I'll be just like everyone else!"
Homer,I wanna be back on the plane.
Homer,Svetlana! Svetlana!
Homer,I came to relax -- you think of it!
Homer,Drunk!
Homer,Why are you applauding them? We wrote it!
Homer,I'm so happy!
Homer,No way -- commercial is for losers and terrorists! I flew on a private plane.
Homer,Please tell me you're joking -- it's the difference between champagne and carbonated pee.
Homer,"I had it all for one night. Now for the rest of my life I'll know what I'm missing. And all I have to remember it by is that my ears haven't popped. Well, I'll make sure that I never yawn again."
Homer,High? High like a private plane? The kind I'll never be invited to ride on again.
Homer,A fresh face!
Homer,"No way. I don't need any shrink, therapist, counselor, motivational speaker or ""guru""."
Homer,"Oh, tell me more!"
Homer,"If you're gonna film me, I insist on a body double."
Homer,"The camera's not on yet, right?"
Homer,"Okay. Uh... well uh... hm, I just uh. I forget what I do."
Homer,"Wait, wait. Uh, this is some of what I do, I think. Sometimes I go places."
Homer,This is our relish tray. I'd like you to film it for insurance purposes.
Homer,What's the point of putting my socks on? I just have to take them off again a week later.
Homer,"Fine, I'll show you a winner, just you watch."
Homer,Think positive. Think positive.
Homer,You were saying...
Homer,Will you shut up? I can't hear the song in my head!
Homer,I've really enjoyed paying you to yell at me and say I suck. But it's no use -- I'm a hopeless loser and always will be.
Homer,This I can do!
Homer,Behold my two-seventeen average... and weep!
Homer,"As I said, I've lost all hope."
Homer,Is this going somewhere?
Homer,"Dr. Fredrick J. Waxman, you're a genius!"
Homer,I wasn't talking to you.
Homer,How many of those have private planes?
Homer,Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing?
Homer,"I'm gettin' that job. Bart, I'll need some clean urine. Stat."
Homer,"Well, I can see the position of handsomest C.E.O. is already taken."
Homer,I got the job!
Homer,"I'm gonna get there early, so I can get in good with the lunch truck guy."
Homer,"Uh, yeah -- I have no job and nowhere to go. What do I have to buy so I can sit here all day?"
Homer,"One small coffee, please. And a dozen of those placemats with the maze on it."
Homer,Somebody's gotta do 'em.
Homer,Look happy.
Homer,"Oh, it was great! Flew to Tulsa on the company jet. Did my job in a way consistent with what I already told you. Because that's what you do. When you have a job."
Homer,Stop peppering me with questions!
Homer,"Well, explanation-wise, the fact is that... I lied. I didn't get the job. You see when I got there..."
Homer,"So she said that's not my ""in box"" and he said that's not the Johnson Report!"
Homer,"Um... um...c'mon, say ""you're hired""!"
Homer,Say it!
Homer,Say it!
Homer,"Stop saying ""security""!"
Homer,"I couldn't bear to tell your mother, so I hang out here all day."
Homer,"Brands like ""Miser's Choice"" and ""Day-Old Delights?"""
Homer,"Honey, there's something I have to tell you..."
Homer,"No, it's, uh... good news!"
Homer,"We're manufacturing a new pipe diameter, five-eighths inch. The company wants you and me to take the private plane to New York for the premiere! So meet me at Shelbyville Airport in an hour."
Homer,"If I'm gonna tell that woman the truth, I'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad."
Homer,"Okay, so this should be enough money to get me up in the air, have a frank talk with Marge then maybe eat a devilled egg."
Homer,"Yeah, uh... semper fudge!"
Homer,"No, I said the right thing."
Homer,Honey... don't try to remember the whole day. Just what you're feeling this second.
Homer,Marge... I've gotta be honest...
Homer,I don't know. Maybe we flew through a rainbow.
Homer,I drove a car over a cliff once. How different could it be?
Homer,"Hm, what's the ocean doing in the sky?"
Homer,I'm trying to land a plane with no experience.
Homer,Duke? That's good.
Homer,Vanderbilt?
Homer,What? I'll show him. I'll show that guy!
Homer,"And now, to taxi to the terminal."
Homer,"Oh yes, of course."
Homer,"Marge, flying in private jets is great and all, but it's just too dangerous. That's why I've decided to go to the plant and beg Mr. Burns for my old job back."
Homer,"You'd think so, but no."
Homer,"So long, suckers!"
Homer,Move it! Move it! Move it! Do you want to be second out of the parking lot? Do you?
Homer,Leave her!
Homer,"You'll never catch me, Lord!"
Homer,"Oh man, that church service was so boring. I did a whole book of Find-A-Words."
Homer,Those are words.
Homer,I wanna say one.
Homer,Denny's.
Homer,"Don't worry, we'll just go home. Your mother can cook."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Lisa's right, son. Your Mom is way too classy a lady to crash a private--"
Homer,"Everyone just act cool. If anyone asks, tell them we're plumbers... and then start plumbing until they go away."
Homer,"Dude! You don't think you know me, but you do!"
Homer,"Mmmm, au jus! Not quite gravy, not quite blood..."
Homer,"Oh, I can't wait to taste that hot fudge, and caramel, and crushed nuts, all slathered over a delicious... elderly corpse?!!!"
Homer,"Come on, we're leaving! Mmm, after one more mini-quiche..."
Homer,Will the tragedies that stalk this family never cease?
Homer,Of course.
Homer,I thought she said polar bear.
Homer,"My back! It hurts, and not in a good way!"
Homer,Stop that! I'm down here!
Homer,"Well, you're always telling me I should eat more dirt."
Homer,Which grow in what?
Homer,My pleasure. IF EVER I WOULD LEAVE YOU / IT WOULDN'T BE IN SUMMER. / SEEING YOU IN SUMMER I NEVER WOULD GO...
Homer,YOUR HAIR STREAKED WITH SUN-LIGHT /
Homer,"YOUR LIPS RED AS FLAME, / YOUR FACE WITH A LUSTER / THAT PUTS GOLD TO SHAME!"
Homer,"BUT IF I'D EVER LEAVE YOU, / IT COULDN'T BE IN AUTUMN. / HOW I'D LEAVE IN AUTUMN I NEVER WILL KNOW..."
Homer,AND COULD I LEAVE YOU / RUNNING MERRILY THROUGH THE SNOW?
Homer,KNOWING HOW IN SPRING I'M BEWITCHED BY YOU SO?
Homer,"OH, NO! NOT IN SPRING-TIME! / SUMMER, WINTER OR FALL! NO, NEVER COULD I LEAVE YOU AT ALL!"
Homer,But I can only sing lying on my back.
Homer,"Oh, oh, I just have one question: what is this movie about?"
Homer,"Excuse me, ""film."""
Homer,HO DANNEGGIATO IL MIO PIEDE!
Homer,NEI CIELI BIGI GUARDO FUMAR DAI MILLE COMIGNOLI PARIGI.
Homer,MIMI!
Homer,MIMI!
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,Well I didn't mean to!
Homer,"Oh, good. This makes up for me showing up drunk to the father-daughter dance."
Homer,"Sorry, Lisa. Can't change the future."
Homer,AND THE HOME OF THE BRA-A-AVE!
Homer,"Wow, praise from Placido Domingo."
Homer,"Eh, I'll think about it."
Homer,"Thanks! You know, of the three tenors, you're my second favorite! No wait, I forgot about that other guy. Sorry, you're third."
Homer,"Hmmm, what if you gave it a little more of this flavor..."
Homer,"Keep reachin' for the stars, kid."
Homer,"Happy anniversary, Sweetie."
Homer,But I need my childhood friends to help me keep it real. Would you have me keep it fake?
Homer,My pleasure.
Homer,To the hottest girls in the room.
Homer,I said you look hot! Hot! Ay Chihuahua!
Homer,Hua-hua!
Homer,No problem.
Homer,"And may I say I'm enjoying the calm waters of your deep, blue eyes?"
Homer,What? That's how guys talk.
Homer,"You guys go on, we're gonna walk home."
Homer,"Marge, when I'm onstage I can only sing those love songs by picturing your beautiful face. So in a way, my groupies are really our groupies."
Homer,"Not me, they love me."
Homer,"Die, you stupid cobra, die!"
Homer,"A lady motorcycle driver?! What is this, the Twilight Zone?"
Homer,"So did you see the show tonight? Remember the part where I forgot the words and I just sang ""Uh-oh Spaghetti-os"". I'm hoping they send me a case."
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"Um, everyone's wearing clothes in here."
Homer,"Uh, I'm not sure she's workin' out."
Homer,"That's it! Let me make something very clear: my heart belongs to Marge and you can never, ever have it. This opera's over when the fat man sings."
Homer,"That's good. You've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. Now, I think it would be best if you left."
Homer,"Julia, wait!"
Homer,"Before you go, could you hire your own replacement? But make sure she's not crazy like you."
Homer,"Who could it be? A disgruntled former employee? Whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol."
Homer,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH / WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO HOO / STU STU STU STU-PID FLANDERS...
Homer,"GET LOST, YOU WASTE OF A MOUSTACHE!"
Homer,"Well that's it, I'm retiring from the opera. It's just too popular."
Homer,And I know something much more fun I can do on my back.
Homer,Singing opera made me good at painting.
Homer,YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME WANNA
Homer,THROW MY HANDS UP AND
Homer,KICK MY HEELS UP AND
Homer,HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!
Homer,A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW!
Homer,HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!
Homer,No problem.
Homer,"My, you've grown."
Homer,Spilled milk?!
Homer,All over the floor.
Homer,"Hey Apu, what happened to all your milk?"
Homer,Does it work?
Homer,"Hey Moe, got any milk?"
Homer,It's paint. Or is it?
Homer,"Yeah, it's paint."
Homer,I've gotta find milk somewhere!
Homer,At first I thought you were pointing to your crotch.
Homer,That's my car!
Homer,"Aw, please, give me a break. I've been driving all night looking for milk for my kids."
Homer,Okay. Let me just grab my registration.
Homer,I can't believe your boss lets you listen to rock music while you work.
Homer,"Wow, I'd really like to meet this guy."
Homer,But it's just you and me... That must mean I'm your boss. I'm sick of you! You're fired!
Homer,"Shut up! When you call in sick, who do you call?"
Homer,Sometimes you want to work?
Homer,Street cattle?
Homer,I think it goes here.
Homer,Some of those were pretty funny.
Homer,"Wow, you make people miserable and there's nothing they can do about it. Just like God."
Homer,"Man oh man, you've got the greatest job in the world!"
Homer,I would love to! But I don't have a tow truck.
Homer,I'm not sure my wife will go for these naughty mud flaps.
Homer,"Uh, that's still too sexy for my wife."
Homer,"Man, you work as a silhouette model for one day and it haunts you for the rest of your life."
Homer,"...which I previously alluded... Are there two ""l's"" in ""alluded""?"
Homer,Why? What happens if I point it this way?
Homer,"Ah, my first tow."
Homer,"Ah, my first tow."
Homer,Really? What's your handicap?
Homer,I'm doing my job!
Homer,You're hovering over a hydrant!
Homer,"I've got tow dough I'm lookin' to blow, Moe!"
Homer,I'm buying a round of the fanciest drink you got.
Homer,Outside? That's a one-hour parking zone -- and you've been here a good eighty-one minutes.
Homer,"Marge, when you're married to a midnight towboy, you might not see him for days on end."
Homer,"Hey, when you married a man who would, years later, without warning, become a tow truck driver, you knew what the deal would eventually be."
Homer,"Guess what, boy. Last night I towed your principal's car."
Homer,"It's Homer, idiot."
Homer,I guess I'm more powerful than God now.
Homer,Who said that? I'll kill them with my power!
Homer,Oh my God... multiple tickets... handicapped spot... parked by a hydrant... incomprehensible vanity plate...
Homer,"If my life as a tow truck driver were a teleplay, this would be the end of act two."
Homer,What? I'm still in Springfield.
Homer,"Okay, I made a mistake. Why don't you give me two demerit points in a point system we work out right now?"
Homer,"Put me down, you lousy-- Wheeee! Okay, I'm warning you-- Wheeee! I'll kill you, you son of a-- Wheeee! All right buddy, that's it, I've had-- Whee--!"
Homer,You... let... go...
Homer,"Ooh, a trap door. What's down there? Your meatball collection?"
Homer,I thought we were friends! I was kidding you in a friendly fashion!
Homer,Who are you guys?
Homer,Is Louie keeping you prisoner here?
Homer,"Okay, I get it. I'm not stupid. It's number two, right?"
Homer,Do not worry. I am working.
Homer,"Ask no questions. And do not call the police, or I will kill me."
Homer,All is well. Goodbye forever.
Homer,And all the Transformers transformed back into trucks and cars. The end.
Homer,"Okay, we've got time for one more."
Homer,"Once upon a time, there was a hilarious ogre named Shrek Three. He lived in medieval times, but sometimes he'd say things from today times..."
Homer,"And if elected president of our small community, I will determine once and for all how far we can go without being gay."
Homer,Maggie!
Homer,We're free!
Homer,Maggie! You did all this?!
Homer,"And to pay you back, I'm returning your nose."
Homer,Here's your nose. Daddy's putting back your nose.
Homer,"Oh, wait. That's Lisa's nose."
Homer,Thanks to her!
Homer,"Wow, Bart! Lookin' good!"
Homer,Right... tomorrow.
Homer,Think. Think.
Homer,"You have to think, it's your job!"
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,What?! Name twelve.
Homer,American sober or Irish sober?
Homer,Point one five.
Homer,Point one oh with a stomach full of bread. My final offer.
Homer,"Goodnight, sweetheart."
Homer,Can't be late for Lisa's big day...
Homer,I'm gonna make it! I'll be on time for Lisa's thing!
Homer,"Ooo, an awesome accident! Easy, easy... I'll just take three seconds to gawk. Aw, everyone's okay."
Homer,Gonna make it! Gonna make it!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Hmmm. Well, Marge, who's the unfit parent now?"
Homer,"An hour and fifty-four minutes to spare. With my free time I can finally work on my ""Superman"" novel."
Homer,"""Make way for Superman,"" said Superman as he punched everyone at the Coffee Bean. Chapter Two..."""
Homer,"Oh, hello, Marge. I'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. Am I disappointed? Yes. Am I surprised? No."
Homer,"What?! Oh my God, my sweet Margie! Okay, listen very carefully: don't do anything they say, remain panicky, and above all, try to be a hero."
Homer,"Chief, you gotta do something -- my current wife is in there!"
Homer,"Oh Marge, I was afraid I was going to lose you! Ohhh! Now let me help you make your slow transition back to society."
Homer,You have a new home now... with us.
Homer,"Sweetheart, what's wrong?"
Homer,You don't owe him anything. Moe was in the hospital for three weeks and I didn't visit him once.
Homer,"Moe the tavern, not Moe the person."
Homer,"Hey Marge, look at us -- the four amigos! They're gonna let me do some odd jobs for them on the outside."
Homer,"The problem is, you don't share my interest in not being with you."
Homer,Why does he always bring up my weight?
Homer,"Don't worry, sir. I'll handle this cleanly, quietly and Bart!"
Homer,"Marge, I'm gonna be home late tonight. I'm going to... Midnight Monkey Madness at the zoo."
Homer,Have fun at your crazy-sounding thing.
Homer,"Now all I have to do is think of a clever line before I pull the trigger. Oh, that's a perfect one. But I don't need to say it out loud, 'cause I'm by myself."
Homer,"Out of my way, mystery skank!"
Homer,Hey! Now I don't get paid!
Homer,Now I'm mad!
Homer,Now I'm .
Homer,Marge is a professional assassin!
Homer,"Hey, what's that?"
Homer,"Great, great -- I turned over so many wheelbarrows... Wait, that was your thing."
Homer,"Seconds, please."
Homer,I'll kill her after dessert!
Homer,You ruined that pie!
Homer,How could you not tell me?
Homer,"Well, they're not as pretty as you, Marge."
Homer,"Okay, here's the deal, I'll do the killing for hire, and you stay home with the kids."
Homer,I just get to keep whatever's in the guy's wallet.
Homer,"I was out getting drunk, then killing people!"
Homer,Why do you think I'm kicking it?
Homer,"Hey, who wants ice cream in bed?"
Homer,At your funeral.
Homer,"Oh, that was so hot! I love watching you do other guys!"
Homer,That can be arranged.
Homer,"...so, killing people together has really spiced things up in the bedroom."
Homer,Crème brûlée! Crème brûlée! Or in English: Burnt Cream! Burnt Cream!
Homer,"Oh Ma-arge! Want some com-pany? As always, silence means yes."
Homer,"How about a little neck rub, baby?"
Homer,"Now, how 'bout the neck of my butt..."
Homer,"Oh Marge, your tentacles feel so good. Wait a minute... why am I getting words in edgewise?"
Homer,"Don't worry, son -- I've got a plan to save your space doggy."
Homer,Who is it?
Homer,"Oh, I'm not decent. Let me throw something on!"
Homer,"Can I help you, gentlemen?"
Homer,"Wow, you guys are good. The alien's right here in the living room."
Homer,"Hop in, Bart, they're gonna let us kill one!"
Homer,Homer -- bored!
Homer,Quiet -- we're missing the dissection!
Homer,No one likes a know-it-all.
Homer,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh..."
Homer,"Oh, lighten up. It's Halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment."
Homer,Hold still! I'm trying to eat my way out from the inside!
Homer,More bread please.
Homer,"Hm, I thought I was killed by that magic spaghetti!"
Homer,"Okay Maggie, just calmly and carefully back away."
Homer,Beehive!
Homer,Blueberries!
Homer,Way to go! Many happy returns.
Homer,There are so many choices. Bolo? Clip on? Piano keys? Ten Commandments of Beer?
Homer,The cornerstones of the Brewish faith.
Homer,And what color would that be?
Homer,Of course I know!
Homer,Uh...
Homer,"Is ""beautiful"" a color?"
Homer,"Marge, give me a break! I don't notice the color of people's eyes! I just judge them on the color of their skin."
Homer,She's wearing white? She must have rolled the odometer back to zero.
Homer,Spaz.
Homer,"...that's why, to this day, you never see a shark with monkey arms."
Homer,"Because if I do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me."
Homer,Sleep tight. The Container Store now has five convenient locations!
Homer,"Don't worry, boy. They'll find your parents soon."
Homer,And we'll move your bedtime to an hour later so you'll have more time to be alone with your thoughts.
Homer,"Hey come on, why don't you cheer up with a glass of Ocean Spray? Oh boy -- forget that. How about some... Cap'n Crunch? Uh, Seven Seas Italian dressing? No, no! Uh, Chicken of the Sea tuna? Billy Ocean CD? The history of Atlantic Records?"
Homer,"I want to, but I can't!"
Homer,"Good idea. I'll drown my sorrows in Anchor Steam Beer! Oh, I'm sorry!"
Homer,Where is it?
Homer,I gotta find out what color Marge's eyes are.
Homer,Cha-ching!
Homer,"Oh Marge darling, what's the combination to our wedding album?"
Homer,"Boy, stop talking to yourself!"
Homer,"Your thoughts should stay in your head! Heh, heh, I sure told him. Now, what am I gonna do about Marge?"
Homer,"Oh, I'll never remember what color Marge's eyes are!"
Homer,Brown? No. Orange? No. Elm? Rake? Guessing?
Homer,"A song? Wait, it's coming back to me."
Homer,THE GIRL I LOVE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL HAIR / A BLUE BOUFFANT FROM HERE TO THERE
Homer,SNOW WHITE TEETH AND LIPS SO RED / SHE'S THE WILMA TO MY FRED
Homer,OH THE GIRL I LOVE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL... EYES
Homer,"/ WHEN HAPPY THEY SPARKLE, WHEN SAD THEY CRIES"
Homer,"/ THOSE EYES ARE GEMS BEYOND APPRAISAL / STUNNING SHADE OF PUREST... Oh, what is it?! I was so close! Let's see, what rhymes with appraisal: basil, nasal -- none of these are colors! Oh, it's hopeless! She'll never love me again."
Homer,"Hazel! Your eyes are hazel -- hazel like the pussywillows by the pond where we first kissed, like the almond paste in the bear claw I ate after we first made love."
Homer,Mmm... porkpie.
Homer,"Marge, I wish you well, but why would women want to go to a gym if there were no men there watching them and judging them?"
Homer,We're gonna be rich! We can finally start a family!
Homer,A better one!
Homer,"Oh yeah, Marge, I love these business trips of yours. The TV remote isn't nailed on. My whole life, I've never been in a hotel that trusted me."
Homer,"Hors d'oeuvres, big fancy desserts... and my wife is paying for everything. Now I know why pimps are so happy."
Homer,I hear that.
Homer,"Fine, I admit it. I'm drunk!"
Homer,"Hey, how ya doin'? I'm Homer. My wife invented a gym for ""regular"" women."
Homer,I pay ten dollars a tube for those!
Homer,"Yeah, I haven't decided what kind of new car to get."
Homer,Are you sure they're not talking about cars? Because those are car words.
Homer,Marge won't dump me. I'm the anchor that keeps her weighed down.
Homer,That will never happen!
Homer,Marge! Marge!
Homer,A makeover!
Homer,Oh my God! The prophecy is being fulfilled.
Homer,"Um, so... tell me about your day."
Homer,I do! I do!
Homer,"Hey, the networks have different channels in this city."
Homer,Are you happy and full of life?
Homer,Old one?! They're convincing Marge to dump me!
Homer,"Marge, get away from them!"
Homer,"You guys gotta help me! If Marge leaves I'll have nothing except my many friends, and half the fortune she is now making and will continue to make."
Homer,What's your secret?
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Fashions.
Homer,"Uh-huh, uh-huh... got it. I know just what it'll take to hang onto Marge."
Homer,"Please, Doc. I know I'm not the greatest looking guy in the world, but I took care of my family, and that used to be enough. But not anymore."
Homer,And I know how I can knock myself out. I'll look at your bill.
Homer,"Hm. I guess considering all the training you've received, this is quite reasonable. I've never seen anything so reasonable! It's the bargain of a lifetime! And--"
Homer,"Kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother."
Homer,"No, I had my stomach stapled!"
Homer,All food tastes like barf now.
Homer,"Welcome home, Marge."
Homer,A smart successful woman like you deserves the very best.
Homer,Do you like guys who are... attractive?
Homer,"All for you, baby."
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, sexy beast. Why don't you take some time to savor the front?"
Homer,"Uh, it used to be."
Homer,"Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the lights now."
Homer,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Homer,"Doctor, I'm embarrassed to show my body to my wife. And it's all because of your surgery!"
Homer,"No, I want you to give me every other surgery you have so I can look good! And can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it?"
Homer,Did someone order a super stud?
Homer,My implants feel itchy.
Homer,You better not make me cry. 'Cause I don't know where my tear ducts are anymore.
Homer,"I don't want to live without you, Marge."
Homer,Noooo!
Homer,Huh? Why do I look like me again?
Homer,Then it was all a dream. I never became a hideous monster.
Homer,"I sure have. Plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. When it is, everyone should get it."
Homer,"Listen Marge... I've been wondering all these years, what is it about me that you find so irresistible? Let's face it... you could do better."
Homer,Aw...
Homer,"Now ignore all the fancy-shmancy thingamajigs, boy. We're just gonna get a camera battery and go home."
Homer,No thanks -- just here for a battery.
Homer,All I want is a battery.
Homer,"Battery, battery, battery!"
Homer,Hmm...
Homer,No...
Homer,Bingo!
Homer,"One battery, please."
Homer,Sold! Sucker.
Homer,My what now?
Homer,"C'mon, Lisa! The TV's been off for five whole minutes!"
Homer,"I spit on your corpse, advertiser-supported television!"
Homer,Why is everything Hollywood makes so excellent? Whyyyy?
Homer,Sometimes I think about gettin' on a bus and never comin' back.
Homer,"Good luck, with my finicky appetite."
Homer,Sold!
Homer,THAT'S HOW THEY GETCHA!
Homer,More ribs for me!
Homer,More ribs for me!
Homer,More ribs for me?
Homer,"Finally, some service. Now listen. We wanna sit under a cool state license plate -- Michigan or better."
Homer,"Next time a commercial comes on, I'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as I can."
Homer,I'd like to know if Wes Doobner is aware of what you're doing in his restaurant.
Homer,"Mr. Doobner, I have a complaint: I work hard, and when I go out with my family, I expect a certain level of basic--"
Homer,Nobody do it.
Homer,"Finally, the ribs."
Homer,Yet another new restaurant fails.
Homer,He cheats at Uno!
Homer,"Yeah, well, between you and me, I still can't stand him."
Homer,I still can't stand him... I still can't stand him... I still can't stand him...
Homer,I don't care about these church jerks... church jerks... church jerks...
Homer,Now?
Homer,But I'm getting a home perm!
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,Yes.
Homer,No.
Homer,Oh yeah!
Homer,"A doctor, huh?"
Homer,I remember.
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,Are you done? 'Cause I've been circling the funeral home for ten minutes.
Homer,"Hey, what smells so good?"
Homer,Eat hobo remains!
Homer,"Marge, he's got to get over his fear of coffins."
Homer,Yeah. The only thing that's gonna be hacked to pieces now is this celebratory cake!
Homer,"Wow, I must have really tied one on last night."
Homer,No more drinking.
Homer,Six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend I actually got home at three a.m.
Homer,Where's Marge?
Homer,"Hey, kids! Have you seen your mother?"
Homer,Or yourselves?
Homer,"Maggie? Has anyone seen anyone?! Oh, of course, they must all be taking a family bath. Without me!"
Homer,Save some suds for--
Homer,Daddy...
Homer,Hey boy! Do you know where the family is? Show me on Mapquest.
Homer,Fine. Google Maps.
Homer,"What's going on, why are you attacking me? Look, if this is about me eating your heart pills, they shouldn't have made them in Good 'N' Plenty colors!"
Homer,"Moe, my family's gone, my dog hates me, and I can't remember what happened last night. Was I here?"
Homer,"A ""Forget-Me-Shot?"" Never heard of it."
Homer,"Mmm, pickle..."
Homer,"Oh my God, why would I wanna wipe out my memory? What horrible thing did I do?"
Homer,Chief Wiggum! I remember seeing you...
Homer,Marge had a black eye?! I could never do something like that! Could I?
Homer,Flanders!
Homer,The queen's private surgeonnn!
Homer,What did I do?
Homer,"What happened in this room? If only these walls could talk... people would pay to come see my amazing talking walls. And I could use that money to-- Hey, a memory!"
Homer,"Dad, I can't remember what I did last night. Do you have any idea?"
Homer,Your memory bubble and you.
Homer,I'm afraid I did something to make Marge and the kids leave me.
Homer,"Really? Well, that's great, Dad. How can I ever repay you?"
Homer,Done.
Homer,How 'bout The Deja Viewmaster?
Homer,Remembrance of things fast?
Homer,The Rememberererer?
Homer,"This is great! I'm finally gonna find out how I ruined my family! Strap me in, nerd!"
Homer,Bo-ring.
Homer,"Ow. Ow. Ow!!! Three, two, one. Owwwww!!!"
Homer,What the hell?
Homer,This bubble allows you to view any past event from your life. It's got that new bubble smell.
Homer,"Aw, I landed in a pleasant memory -- look at happy me and playful them."
Homer,"Oh, I miss those bygone days of earlier this week. But I'm needed in a darker place."
Homer,Another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my TV Guide?
Homer,"I've gotta find out who that guy is, but I need help. Someone like Bart, only smart. Lisa!"
Homer,"Lisa, I'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life. You wanna join me?"
Homer,Bring it on.
Homer,"Well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old Homer."
Homer,I'll teach you to beat up yester-me!
Homer,Who was it with?
Homer,Right.
Homer,"Kids, your mom is with another man, and I need you to help me find out who he is. Hm... is this really something I should show you kids?"
Homer,"It's okay -- we're not really your kids. We're just representations of them, that you created in your mind."
Homer,Really? Then if I created all this... that means I can have pizza anytime I want!
Homer,"Hello, I'd like to order a pizza. Thirty-five minutes?!"
Homer,See? That's where my memory stops. Who the heck is that guy?
Homer,What if you just moved the bottle?
Homer,All right. Let me just get out of this bubble smoothly and elegantly.
Homer,How can I get my memory to work?
Homer,The mother of my children with the reason for my children!
Homer,Noooo!
Homer,Your stupid invention made me realize my life is worthless!
Homer,My life is ruined.
Homer,"Goodbye, cruel world."
Homer,"And goodbye, Cruller World."
Homer,"Wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy, then I'm not gonna do it."
Homer,My life's flashing before my eyes.
Homer,A life well-lived. Until last night. I guess I'll have to watch that now.
Homer,"Hey, what's going on here?!"
Homer,A surprise party?
Homer,Are you kidding? The mother of my children with the reason for my children! This is gonna be the greatest party ever!
Homer,Oh my God! It's like Christmas in December! Let's celebrate now.
Homer,"Don't worry honey, I'll get you an ice pack. Where's the ice pack?"
Homer,"So Marge wasn't cheating on me, I never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. Thank God I figured it out before I did anything stupid."
Homer,"Oh, right."
Homer,Oh my God! I'm not dead!
Homer,This is great! I must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair.
Homer,What plan?
Homer,Marge put so much work into that party. The least I could do is be surprised. If only I could forget what happened today.
Homer,"Hmmm... The only problem is, I'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman. No doubt I'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. And that will make me want to jump off a--"
Homer,"For the love of God, make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce."
Homer,"And when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure I got here."
Homer,Hmmm... The only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,Who's an angry dog? Who's an angry dog?
Homer,"No, this is a moment I want to remember."
Homer,Oh no! He's talking to that mailroom guy.
Homer,"Listen carefully. I have taken your wife hostage. If you don't have a wife, I have kidnapped your brother. Nod if you understand."
Homer,"Now, back away from Burns and I will let your dog live."
Homer,Good. Now stop and dance like a happy prospector.
Homer,Happier!
Homer,Happier!
Homer,Happier!
Homer,Oh right. Just leave! But kick like a Rockette!
Homer,We're free!
Homer,"Set the table, Marge!"
Homer,I can already taste those deep-fried pork chops!
Homer,When you ask me that it's never good.
Homer,"Marge, that was a joke!"
Homer,"Well, if I'm gonna start a diet, this is my last chance to eat all the crap I love."
Homer,"I think I'll miss you most of all, Captain Corndog's Schnitzel Palace. No tears, Homer."
Homer,"Uh-oh, can't let Marge see this."
Homer,A drive-up trashcan!
Homer,This must be how the rich toss out their gold. And as long as I'm cleaning out the family chariot...
Homer,Cups... newspapers... bottles... tricycle... lawn chair... un-cashed checks...
Homer,"Hmm... ""Dispose of proper--"" This book is too hard."
Homer,Now for a victory cigar.
Homer,I can't stand to see a grown burger cry. We must rebuild Fast Food Boulevard!
Homer,"I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a future where food is brought by waiters... where the chairs aren't attached to the tables... and where I can't ditch my kids in a pit of dirty balls. I say we rebuild the Fast-Food District -- bigger and better than ever!"
Homer,"C'mon, Marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!"
Homer,"Think tank, eh?"
Homer,What? Not allowed to get one right?
Homer,Die Hard Two!
Homer,I live in that place!
Homer,He's got my vote.
Homer,Dear God. What have I done?
Homer,"Oh my God, they're going steady -- did everyone see that?!"
Homer,That was the best milkshake ad I've ever seen. It makes me want a milkshake!
Homer,"If you haven't sprung from, or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house!"
Homer,"You too, Fred Thompson."
Homer,Is everyone here as sick of those stupid politicians as I am?
Homer,"Why don't we all pick the most ridiculous candidate, and write him in?"
Homer,"No, no. This candidate has to be unbelievably ridiculous."
Homer,No. But you're close.
Homer,What I did made the TV thing happen.
Homer,I dig the Wig! I dig the Wig!
Homer,"Lisa, being President is easy. You just point the army and shoot."
Homer,"Oh, the Patriot Act is so terrible! The government might find out what library books I take out. What's next -- finding out what operas I go to?"
Homer,"Don't worry, kids. These wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm."
Homer,I thought global warming would take care of it. Al Gore can't do anything right.
Homer,Like which kid's their favorite! It's Lisa.
Homer,Things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. It was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.
Homer,"Oh, it was a wonderful time. The Iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling Matt Groening created ""Futurama,"" and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a TV show called ""Melrose Place""..."
Homer,Your mother and I were dating and we had just moved into our first apartment together.
Homer,"We didn't have a lot of money, but we were young and in love."
Homer,"Like all young people, I had a musical dream."
Homer,A dream called inoffensive urban light hip-hop smooth grooves.
Homer,But Marge's education was worth all the pistol whipping in the world.
Homer,Marge! Marge! Where are you?!
Homer,"I was so depressed, I spent all my time in a bar."
Homer,I had finally realized every rock star's dream...
Homer,...hating being famous.
Homer,A tale of two young outlaws in love...
Homer,I had become diabetic from drinking too many Frappuccinos.
Homer,"With the nineties drawing to a close, and the Sydney Olympics to look forward to, our love rekindled..."
Homer,"And one moonlit night, I finally had fun at a mini-golf course."
Homer,"Yep, that professor couldn't keep me and Marge apart."
Homer,"I mean, unless he had been a little nicer at the beach."
Homer,"And once we were back together, I was too happy ever to grunge again."
Homer,"Good, 'cause I'm parking at it right now."
Homer,"For the next two hours, we'll be kid free. It'll be just like the time we lost them at the mall."
Homer,That was the best Christmas ever.
Homer,"Ah, the Tunnel of Love -- nothing gets a woman in your arms faster than scary robots and simulated privacy."
Homer,Marge! Look over there!
Homer,What if I told you some of the greatest love stories of all time?
Homer,Even better -- a tale of ... One moment.
Homer,"You'd think so, but..."
Homer,They were the Bonnie and Clyde of their day. Their names were... Bonnie and Clyde.
Homer,Even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it. Why can't this be the Tunnel of Hockey Fights?
Homer,"Happy Valentine's Day, and shut your gob."
Homer,Loa...ner?
Homer,Wow. This is the kind of car you see in commercials! How much am I paying for this?
Homer,"Hm, it seems like a lot..."
Homer,"Really? You people are idiots! That's the dumb-- What a stu-- I mean, that sounds fair."
Homer,Look at you! Idiots!
Homer,DRIVER OF A LOANER CAR / MUCH BETTER THAN A / DRIVER OF MY NORMAL CAR...
Homer,None.
Homer,"Hey boy, check out my new car!"
Homer,Wanna take a ride with your old man?
Homer,C'mon. C'mon. Oh c'mon.
Homer,"What's the matter, son?"
Homer,"Aw, don't give up, boy. I believe in you -- and not just because I have to."
Homer,"Son, I know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. But since then, I've really come to respect you. And unlike love, respect can't be bought."
Homer,That's my boy! Now let's watch the air conditioner fight the heater!
Homer,Now let's add the rear window defogger!
Homer,Twister! Get down!
Homer,"Mrs. Simpson, may I take you for an evening drive? Our loaner awaits!"
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,"Hello, you've reached the snug bug. What do you mean my car's ready?! Well you can keep it, 'cause I'm never giving up this one. Now why don't you enjoy the sounds of my wife and me making sweet, sweet love."
Homer,"That wasn't us, that was the transmission."
Homer,"Yeah, I can't believe all those years I used to drive that old piece of... What the?!"
Homer,My old car!
Homer,So you're sure this baby'll make it out to the desert?
Homer,"Sure! Why, what did ya have in mind?"
Homer,"Well, we're gonna start by shootin' her full of holes. And then me and the boys are gonna have a little fun with her."
Homer,I'll have you know I love this car as if it was my own child.
Homer,"Sorry, Maggie."
Homer,It's too much work. Why don't you come and get me?
Homer,Just gimme a minute. But feel free to go nuts on me.
Homer,"Oh boy, dinner time! The perfect break between work and drunk."
Homer,"Wait, what's that smell? It's like a stalk of broccoli fell in a pot of boiling water."
Homer,But I have all those old diets I still haven't finished.
Homer,I'll bet no man would touch you.
Homer,"It's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!"
Homer,Three please!
Homer,Not quite.
Homer,"Well, they say muscle weighs more than fat."
Homer,What?! I'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.
Homer,"Hey Marge, looking for something? I'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper I don't like. Maybe it'll be this one."
Homer,Wrong again.
Homer,Work.
Homer,"I, uh, I have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. Conservation of mass -- it's the law."
Homer,I now declare you chips and salsa.
Homer,"Oh, hey, kids! Um... What's up?"
Homer,Well... I certainly wasn't eating chips and salsa from this briefcase.
Homer,Nothing!
Homer,"Mmm, lamb."
Homer,"C'mon, pick up, pick up! I know you're there."
Homer,"Listen, baby. The other night was great, but it can never happen again. Oh, who am I kidding? I have to see you right now!"
Homer,Pudding power activate!
Homer,"Sweetheart, I didn't want to deceive you. I just couldn't stand to see the disappointment in your beautiful eyes."
Homer,"Bart, it's me!"
Homer,"I'm Lord Evilton from the ""Angelica Button"" books."
Homer,"C'mon, boy. All the nerds are doin' it."
Homer,Move or die!
Homer,"Well, that's our book for the year -- I think we've earned some TV."
Homer,"But kids, I want you in bed by three a.m."
Homer,"Hey, somebody's gotta be the bad guy."
Homer,"Stop saying things, Bart! That's the TV's job!"
Homer,That's right. Now I'll cut and you soak.
Homer,Go-go or boring?
Homer,"Son, while your mother and little mother are out, I'm gonna let you in on a deep dark family secret."
Homer,I said secret.
Homer,Have you ever wondered what I do in that locked room?
Homer,Well wonder no more!
Homer,"Thanks, son."
Homer,Some of that is cow blood.
Homer,"My Hindu friend, this is a chance for your Kwik-E-Mart to get in on the ground floor of a delicious new taste sensation."
Homer,Where's our jerky?
Homer,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You haven't seen our Power Point presentation. Bart?"
Homer,Who could have done this?!
Homer,This can only mean one thing.
Homer,Flanders! You ate my jerky!
Homer,I know you ate my jerky. Just like I ate your earthquake supplies!
Homer,You stay right here.
Homer,"Yeah, that's it, don't be shy..."
Homer,"Enjoy your jerky laced with sleeping pills... nobody outwits Homer Simpson... Hey, they're not sleepy. They're just turning fuzzy..."
Homer,"I thought this might happen, so I brought the best weapon to operate while drugged: a crossbow."
Homer,"That wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal."
Homer,You're on your own.
Homer,When you cut 'em they multiply -- I can't fight that! Now let's take care of those raccoons.
Homer,"Awww, they're using the jerky to feed their family! Look, there's a Homer and a Bart and a Marge and a Lisa. Aww... and they even share my views on parenting!"
Homer,"Enjoy your jerky, little critters, and one day you'll grow up to be people. Bart, get some more jerky for man's new best friend."
Homer,Lisa!
Homer,Gimme that!
Homer,I can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.
Homer,I can't believe you were smoking. Do you know the sturgeon general said you're not supposed to?
Homer,And a very wise fish he is!
Homer,"Marge, I'm taking Lisa out of that stupid-- What the?"
Homer,Uh... are you sure you want Lisa to keep dancing?
Homer,Maybe you're drunk.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Fatherhood hurts my brain.
Homer,"Because it means so much to your mother, you can keep doing ballet. But you have to stop smoking -- including secondhand!"
Homer,What'd you say?
Homer,I thought you might have trouble with this. That's why I'm assigning someone to keep watch over you. Someone you'd never expect.
Homer,"Come on out, boy."
Homer,"Y'ello. She what?! Oh, my God! Well I'm gonna settle this once and for all! Meet me at the place we discussed."
Homer,Wrong number.
Homer,"Okay, Bart, it's time for operation: crazy-plan. Step one: we chuck the raccoon in there."
Homer,Don't worry. I have a perfect way to conceal his identity.
Homer,"See? Now go, boy!"
Homer,"Not keys, cigarettes!"
Homer,"Yeah, that's what I mean."
Homer,"Hee-hee. Okay, now we get rid of the cigarettes..."
Homer,This is my favorite family tradition -- ice cream after a botched recital.
Homer,No!
Homer,"Now practice preening to the crowd, El Guapo."
Homer,"Come on, preen harder! Make them hate you! You feed on their hatred... and you are so hungry!"
Homer,"Dad, are you sure you're okay to drive at night?"
Homer,"All right, that's it, pull over."
Homer,I was having the most wonderful dream. I always wake up just before the good part.
Homer,"I'll see you later, honey."
Homer,"Homer Simpson. I know a lot of you from church, and the market and such. And I'm not much for talkin' -- but seems to me, in hard times like these that we Americans come together."
Homer,"So I say we roll up our sleeves, and fake a disaster to trick the federal government out of relief money."
Homer,"Kids, marriage is like a car. Along the way it has its bumps and dings, and this country can't make one that lasts more than five years. With Lurleen I just walked past the showroom and didn't even go inside. Now let's return to watching the news."
Homer,I told her not to go into one of those.
Homer,"Don't worry, you can stay with us. I'm sure Marge will be cool."
Homer,Confederate degenerate?
Homer,"Boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks."
Homer,"How could a man just abandon his family? By which I mean, what is the method he would use and could anyone do it?"
Homer,Where you going?
Homer,"Wait a minute -- he's a deadbeat dad, and yet he's getting as much love as me, a Dad too lazy to run away!"
Homer,"And he has hair! Bart, get me my suicide axe."
Homer,Later.
Homer,Just sit still in my lap!
Homer,Why you little--
Homer,Get back here so we can put our love on a shirt!
Homer,What?
Homer,Lurleen's daddy comes back after thirty years and he's father of the year. Why can't I leave for thirty years?
Homer,Well... it might be cold outside.
Homer,"Oh, I see. It's reverse psychology. Well in that case I'm not going and I'm not staying. And I'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling."
Homer,"Song's over, Dad."
Homer,"Yeah, me too. Since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word ""pop"" out of all of our foods."
Homer,"Marge, my fringes are knotted again."
Homer,"And remember, you can do anything you want in the world of country music, western wear merchandising and TV movies. Regular movies, don't hold your breath. But TV movies, the sky's the limit."
Homer,Ten percent Lycra.
Homer,"Ooo, I think he's a keeper."
Homer,That's right.
Homer,Don't you worry about Wikipedia -- we'll change it when we get home. We'll change a lot of things.
Homer,"Yeah, what's the deal, loser?"
Homer,"Son, a lot of these youth organizations encourage parents to get involved in the activities--"
Homer,Sold.
Homer,See ya!
Homer,"Son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. Also, don't be a cow."
Homer,And I'll make sure Flanders doesn't bother us.
Homer,Bart's in trouble and we don't need your stupid comments!
Homer,"Okay, they bought it."
Homer,Have you got Lou in your car?
Homer,You guys come and get me as soon as they dump me back in the feedlot.
Homer,"Ooh, Laughter House! With the world in the shape it's in, we could all use some comedy."
Homer,Ready... for... pick up. Ready! For! Pick up!
Homer,I'm a human being -- let me go!
Homer,Hmm... that sounds like Tress MacNeille.
Homer,Marge... kids... the things I saw. It makes me never wanna eat meat again...
Homer,"Just fish... chicken... burgers... veal on Fridays... deer, but only in season... and if necessary, the sweetest meat of all... human."
Homer,We're not here for the game. The game is nothing. The game is crap. The game makes me sick!
Homer,"The real reason we Americans put up with sports, is for this..."
Homer,"Behold, the tailgate party -- the pinnacle of human achievement!"
Homer,"Since the dawn of parking lots, man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise. What childbirth is to women, eating trunk meats is to the be-wanged."
Homer,What could be greater than eating and drinking for hours in a drizzly parking lot?
Homer,"All right, time to dig in. I brought everything we need."
Homer,The food is all around us.
Homer,"Up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching."
Homer,"Moleman! Come here, ya big bag-a skin! How the hell are ya, huh?!"
Homer,"Yeah? No kidding? Well, that sounds like you're gonna have fun."
Homer,Can I be Smithers?
Homer,"Why, 'cause I'm fat?"
Homer,"What, I'm going for a Shia LaBeouf thing. Not quite a nerd, not quite a hunk... Shia LaBeouf!"
Homer,Uh-oh. There's already an on-set romance.
Homer,"Stupid charities, they think I'm gonna give them money? Save the Children? Save your breath. Take a hike, Sierra Club! Doctors Without Borders? Doctors without money! Hey, Greenpeace, you're not getting' a piece of my green! Robert Redford? Guess what -- a scissor runs through it."
Homer,"""Film Festival,"" eh?"
Homer,Where'd everybody go?
Homer,"Maybe I can finally meet Jim Jarmusch and ask him who he is. Hey, that's him!"
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,What else?
Homer,"Prove it, Hollywood!"
Homer,"Hey, you're crying!"
Homer,What?
Homer,"We can't wait to see it, sweetie."
Homer,A documentary?!
Homer,"One, two, three... Another chute?!"
Homer,Why... doesn't... life... give me... ladders?!
Homer,You stupid kid! What if I walked in here barefoot?
Homer,Quirky? Quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! You made us look like monsters!
Homer,Don't you dare post that review.
Homer,"Not if I can help it! C'mere, beams! Come on! Hey, hey, where you going? Oh, there's too many!"
Homer,No.
Homer,I never wanted to be famous for being mean. I wanted to be famous for catching Santa Claus.
Homer,I know! Kinda miss it.
Homer,Sit on a bench! Sit on a bench!
Homer,"Well, this is kind of a cute outfit."
Homer,What did you say?
Homer,It's a medical condition!
Homer,Who told you these things about me?!
Homer,"I don't want to get mad, but I will!"
Homer,That's it...
Homer,It didn't have to go down like this!
Homer,"Don't worry -- I'm ready for this. Bart, fetch ""The Defender."""
Homer,That's where the food sleeps!
Homer,"Wait a minute, I smell apples... cinnamon... crust... it's a pie!"
Homer,Why would a robber make pie?
Homer,"You're right, boy!"
Homer,Mom!
Homer,You're alive! And you baked a pie!
Homer,I'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!
Homer,"Mom, I can't believe you're here. You keep disappearing and reappearing and it's not funny. You're just like that show ""Scrubs""."
Homer,No thanks.
Homer,"Every time you go, I feel abandoned. But not this time. I'm not gonna let myself get hurt."
Homer,"That's what your mouth says, but my ears are too smart to believe it. In fact, I don't even want your pie."
Homer,Well I'm not going to digest it!
Homer,You left a hole in my heart that could never be filled. So I filled it with food. But I'm never full.
Homer,"Oh, I don't even care."
Homer,I'm fine -- it's my feelings that are mad.
Homer,No! I can't forgive you -- and I don't accept your tuck-in!
Homer,"I feel terrible. My own mother reached out to me, and I rejected her. I'm gonna make her a card."
Homer,Mom?
Homer,Are you asleep?
Homer,Asleep with your eyes open? Mom?
Homer,Mom!
Homer,My mother's dead.
Homer,"Oh, this just gets worse and worse."
Homer,I'll tell you what she didn't want -- me to be a jerk to her and then she dies.
Homer,She said I didn't suck?
Homer,That bad. Wow.
Homer,I just wish she hadn't died thinking I hated her.
Homer,"Apu, what do you think happens after you die?"
Homer,"I mean, do you think my mother's out there somewhere? Does she know I feel bad about things I said?"
Homer,That's it.
Homer,A donut from the future!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Aw, ma. You always knew just how to make everything all right."
Homer,It works on so many levels.
Homer,I've gotta get out of here!
Homer,No...
Homer,"Okay, this is it. I've got one last chance to make up for the things I said to my Mom. I will avenge you!"
Homer,"I'm really glad you corrected me, Lisa. People are always really glad when they're corrected."
Homer,"This is hard work. Isn't it, boy? Boy?"
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"I always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me."
Homer,"To spare, eh?"
Homer,"Marge, your back is so sweaty. I'm starting to slip off."
Homer,That's the highest point. And only fifteen minutes to go.
Homer,Made it!
Homer,"Mom, we didn't know each other very well. If we did, you never would have asked me to climb anything. But even when you weren't around, I always felt good, knowing you were out there somewhere."
Homer,"Three o'clock. Goodbye, Mom. You're finally free."
Homer,"Wait a minute... Mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. Mom! You used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?"
Homer,"Hm, what could I make from those two things?"
Homer,I'm safe as long as nothing disturbs this incredibly delicate balance.
Homer,Wheee!
Homer,Show me the law that says I can't! Wheee!
Homer,I don't think so.
Homer,"You can have her. To me, she's been nothing but trouble."
Homer,Just what are you guys up to?
Homer,The rainforest?! That's that thing Lisa likes!
Homer,"You monster! On another subject, next Thursday I have to leave work early. I assume that's cool."
Homer,"Mom, I'm so sorry. You just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. Well, if I get out of this I promise you I'll grant your last wish."
Homer,Toss it down!
Homer,"Thanks, boy."
Homer,How am I ever gonna take on all those guys?
Homer,God Bless America!
Homer,"That'll do, brick, that'll do."
Homer,Now I'll just add water to these ashes and bring my mother back to life.
Homer,"Well then, Mom, this was for you."
Homer,Pee?!
Homer,Bart's having girl trouble. You better go talk to him.
Homer,I thought I was in charge of bedtime stories and pets dying.
Homer,"Fine -- but you just bought yourself ""ear piercing"" and ""strange new feelings."""
Homer,"Son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of Krusty...which appears to be everything. Hey, maybe we should give Lisa this room. You know she works for Krusty now."
Homer,"Uh, we'll stick with the coins."
Homer,"Son... all hobbies suck. But if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to kill some precious time."
Homer,Do you wanna collect coins with your old man?
Homer,To your mother's purse!
Homer,This is the first book I've ever finished reading or pushing things into.
Homer,We missed one!
Homer,"The one on the left looks into it, but the one on the right is just experimenting. Son, we are getting that coin!"
Homer,Wait!
Homer,This is a classic nineteen seventy-eight Pizza Hut! Mmm... terrible.
Homer,"Son, coin collecting's a lot like life. It stopped being fun a long time ago. But unlike life, I have a solution for this."
Homer,"Okay boy, this is it. Five dollars!"
Homer,Five dollars cash!
Homer,Five hundred and one!
Homer,"Objection, your honor."
Homer,"Mr. Burns, my son and I have been collecting coins. It's really brought us closer together. That penny you bought tonight would mean the world to him."
Homer,"Yeah. I'll tell you what, at least help me buy the boy a gumball. Do you have change for a nickel?"
Homer,Aaaaannnnnd done.
Homer,"You got it, boy."
Homer,I'll use my one phone call to find out all about it!
Homer,Three-peat.
Homer,I make that in a year.
Homer,And if I don't show up?
Homer,What a great job. And I could use a job right now.
Homer,"Okay, I've set my trap. Now to scatter my cheese cubes and the rats will come. Condos! Affordable condos! Bail-jumpers welcome!"
Homer,Stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!
Homer,"Now, are you gonna come quietly, or do I have to..."
Homer,"Now, let's think about this. If you shoot me, I won't be able to stop you and you'll be free to go. But someone may come after you. Probably not, given your reputation for shooting people who come after you. What I'm trying to say is, not shooting me now would be the biggest mistake of your life."
Homer,Flanders!
Homer,"This case is ""in the bag."""
Homer,"I sure could've, thanks to you."
Homer,"Hey, Ned."
Homer,I brought you something.
Homer,He hands a greeting card to Ned.
Homer,ANGLE ON: GREETING CARD
Homer,It's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper.
Homer,"Ned, I never thought I'd say this, but we make a great team."
Homer,"We should be bounty hunters together. You're kind and smart, I'm cruel and strong. Together, we're nothing. But together, we're the perfect bounty hunter."
Homer,Sure. What is it?
Homer,And you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.
Homer,"This taser is awesome. Finally, a practical use for electricity."
Homer,Just warming it up. Now to melt the cheese in this croissant...and get rid of a little excess earwax...and smoke a relaxing cigar.
Homer,No problem.
Homer,Let's roll.
Homer,"No, it looks cool!"
Homer,Daddy's home! I brought you kids some stuff from work!
Homer,"Here you go, son. Shell casings."
Homer,Point them away from your sisters when you hammer them.
Homer,Something for the sweetest little scientist in the world. A new chemistry set.
Homer,The biggest one in town.
Homer,Evidence that I love my little girl.
Homer,"Marge, I brought you some flowers! A full dozen this time! No tricks!"
Homer,"Yes, for now. I guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. Maybe we could order one of your cakes for Lisa's birthday."
Homer,What'd you do that for?
Homer,I'm not convinced.
Homer,Still on the fence.
Homer,Now I believe you.
Homer,He'll be here sooner or later.
Homer,"So, how 'bout a little stakeout music?"
Homer,"Well, I like A.C.-D.C."
Homer,DONE FOR FREE
Homer,"Oh, you've gotta try it. This way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach. Then, BAM!"
Homer,"You've got to roll it from the point. Here, let me show you."
Homer,Now let it unfurl in your stomach.
Homer,There he is!
Homer,There's one thing he didn't count on: my reckless indifference to human life!
Homer,"Hey, it worked, didn't it? Okay smart guy, you're going in the bag."
Homer,"Oh, wait. I left a sandwich in there."
Homer,You know what your problem is? You haven't become as bad as the people we chase!
Homer,I'll tell you what's over! This partnership!
Homer,I can't take another word out of you!
Homer,"I can't believe Flanders dumped me. Marge, do we have any more of your extra-long Twinkies?"
Homer,"Marge, what's going on?"
Homer,"Marge, I can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. But withholding sexy cake? I know we have to move past this, but I don't see how."
Homer,"First, why don't you and I and the cake take a shower?"
Homer,Hello! Hello? Anybody home? Hello?
Homer,What have you done to my family?
Homer,And how did you know I wouldn't be there?
Homer,"Well, you'll never take me alive!"
Homer,Forgot my keys.
Homer,"I loved you, man!"
Homer,You hang onto resentment like a Confederate widow.
Homer,"Yeah, but you hold onto the big things! The point is, the more I got to know you, the more I got to like you."
Homer,"So, it's gonna be like that, eh?"
Homer,"I've got you, my friend."
Homer,"Well, I'm--"
Homer,Phew. Now all we have to do is get out before the concrete hardens.
Homer,"Aw, dammit!"
Homer,Make it life and you've got a deal.
Homer,"Oh, baby."
Homer,"Thanks, Marge."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,This counts as a parent-teacher conference!
Homer,Did he take the bait?
Homer,"Hey, he went into a construction site!"
Homer,Bart just keeps spinning around and around and around. What's his angle?
Homer,We're doing laundry.
Homer,No problem.
Homer,"Eh, he won't get far. Not on the crappy breakfast I made for him."
Homer,Our little boy has lost his mind. Let's get him.
Homer,"Bart! Where are you, boy?! Don't worry, I won't strangle you."
Homer,"Absolutely -- that unpleasantness in Ecuador is behind us, my coca leaf addiction is under control , and Bart is finally trapped in that paradise above the clouds."
Homer,"Is that him? No, it's just a bush. Clearly the work of Wirakocha, the trickster god."
Homer,The computer says Bart's standing on the computer. All I see is a stupid bird with a tracking chip on its leg! It doesn't add up!
Homer,"Oh, uh, she's uh..."
Homer,"Stupid shopping list, turning food into work. Bart!"
Homer,"You better settle down, boy, or I'll drag you into the blind spot of that security camera..."
Homer,...and beat you with one of those big thick women's magazines with all the ads in it!
Homer,"Hmmm, you make a good case. I'll take it!"
Homer,You just cost me two hundred thousand dollars!
Homer,I was gonna bet it on the dogs!
Homer,That kid has become a Dennis-level menace!
Homer,Bart cost us fifty thousand dollars.
Homer,I'm going to Moe's.
Homer,I don't want your pity booze. I'll pay for it myself.
Homer,"Oh, you look great."
Homer,"Well Marge, you did have that one sip of alcohol while you were pregnant..."
Homer,"Stop it, both of you! Don't make me drive into that tree! You know I will!"
Homer,"Lenny, it was pretty cool of you to spend your lotto winnings on your pals..."
Homer,"Get out here, boy! I wanna punish you before I get drunk and merciful!"
Homer,You ruin everything! /
Homer,Human garbage can to the rescue!
Homer,"So at work today, we got a memo saying everyone's getting new chairs."
Homer,"Talk louder? You bet. Naturally, I threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. But then Lenny said ""No, that was the new chair. That memo was two months old!"" So now I'm sitting on an orange crate. I never felt so--"
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"That's it, boy! You're going to bed without supper!"
Homer,"If that boy thinks I'm paying to put him through four years of puberty, forget it! Stupid kids... think I'm made of hormones..."
Homer,Give me back my newspaper!
Homer,"For your information, the ""Daily Growl"" is the only newspaper that's not afraid to say how great this country is!"
Homer,"How's the war going? We're winning, that's great! And our standing abroad? Fantastic!"
Homer,"ALL AROUND THE SOMETHING WORLD,"
Homer,"Thank you, future Bart, for traveling back through time to warn us!"
Homer,"This looks like a job for Captain Crazy! Up, up and away!"
Homer,"Aw come on, gravity. You used to be cool!"
Homer,Occupied!
Homer,"Two hot chocolates, please!"
Homer,No.
Homer,"Y'know, I feel sorry for you, kid. Going back to that cold, loveless family."
Homer,Take me with you!
Homer,I'll be anything and everything you want! Don't leave me here with them!
Homer,Nobody shuts out my blather!
Homer,Were we ever that stupid?
Homer,"Marge, I thought of a new thing -- it's called ""biking out."" It's a combination of biking and making out."
Homer,"C'mon, all the teens on bikes are doin' it."
Homer,Marge! I love this guy!
Homer,"He rhymes! Oh, happy day!"
Homer,I wish -- we were bicycling to a lake.
Homer,"Marge Bouvier, will you not marry me?"
Homer,"Then I now pronounce us ""just dating."""
Homer,I love kissing you. I never want to knock it off.
Homer,Knock it off!
Homer,How dare you expose my children to your tender feelings! Bart! Don't you dare take your eyes off that Gameboy!
Homer,Videogames -- the reason this generation of Americans is the best ever.
Homer,"Hey, everybody pees in the pool!"
Homer,That's it!
Homer,"Eat gravel, hags!"
Homer,I have the situation under control. The compass needle is pointing east.
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
Homer,I know -- I was hoping the number might be zero.
Homer,"A really fun party? Full of colored cheeses and awesome stuff to do? Doesn't seem like your kind of thing, Marge."
Homer,"Eh, let my Dad enjoy 'em a little longer."
Homer,"No, get two of your own."
Homer,"No, I'm trying to get me drunk."
Homer,"Well, a horoscope would never lie to a pretty girl like you."
Homer,"No, I'm talking to you, at this great party!"
Homer,"Limbo? You mean the dance or that place where unbaptized babies go? Either way, I'm in."
Homer,Or you!
Homer,SOMETHING SOMETHING LIMBO SOMETHING
Homer,She's not strange! She's fun! And she doesn't get jealous when I talk to other women!
Homer,Sushi fight!!
Homer,These fish died for nothing!
Homer,What a cute couple. She's gonna take him for a lot of money.
Homer,Here we are.
Homer,"Kids, this place has very special memories for your mother and me."
Homer,I'll put a hundred bucks in your col-lege fund.
Homer,I'll steal it back when you're sleep-ing.
Homer,"Why Flanders, you rogue."
Homer,"All Marge and I need are a queen-sized bed and a king-sized ""Do Not Disturb"" sign."
Homer,What?! But I have urges!
Homer,"He's not talking, he's yelling!"
Homer,"I never thought I'd say this, but... Stupid Flanders."
Homer,Marge?
Homer,Do you have a pineapple pizza?!
Homer,This is all going so fast.
Homer,"I came here once with Marge. Are you Marge, Sylvia?"
Homer,I want you to be Marge.
Homer,Marge?!
Homer,Marge? Is that you?
Homer,"Marge, what are you doing here?"
Homer,"You better not be! I mean, great! We both came to rekindle our precious memories of when we were young and in love. Right?"
Homer,"Oh, oh, oh, I have a better idea -- let's spend the night together, right here."
Homer,I feel the same way about that lamp.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Listen, you're a classy lady and a great sushi fighter. But you're goin' in the box."
Homer,"Coming, Marge!"
Homer,"Now let's spend the rest of the night making sweet, sweet--"
Homer,Kids?!
Homer,That takes care of those three -- want to go for a lakeside snuggle?
Homer,"Well, that takes care of those three -- want to go play some lakeside Boggle?"
Homer,"Hmm, all right. The trick is to ease them off--"
Homer,"You're just as bad as me. And you used to be better, so that makes you worse! I don't think we can ever trust each other again."
Homer,"Ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare."
Homer,I wish I'd never met you!
Homer,Yeah. I missed her like five times.
Homer,Forever? That would be awesome.
Homer,And I suppose you and Maude will be coming along as well?
Homer,"Marge, when I'm with you, I get that feeling like when I got that smart kid's report card by mistake. For a minute, I thought I had all A's. And that my name was Howard Simberg."
Homer,"I know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, I'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it."
Homer,I hate other people's love.
Homer,So that wasn't Marge's glider parked outside the motel five years ago! I'm getting out of this marriage while I'm still young and handsome.
Homer,4 Ever. I couldn't even keep a promise I made to a tree. Maybe it's not too late! Maybe I can still save our love. If I just show her that carving...
Homer,Saving our marriage!
Homer,Help! Fat man hanging from a tree!
Homer,I don't want to let go of our special carving!
Homer,"Marge, I don't want to die with us mad at each other."
Homer,"I know parts of our marriage are based on lies, but so are a lot of good things: religion, American history..."
Homer,Awww.
Homer,Now we wait for the river to freeze. If my theory of global cooling is correct.
Homer,She blew it again! Woo-hoo!
Homer,But we're married.
Homer,How about R?
Homer,Woo-hoo! Adult situations!
Homer,Lemonade!
Homer,"Six cups, please. And put it on my tab."
Homer,"Keep moving, deadbeat -- cash only."
Homer,"Fine, lemonade's for babies anyway! I'm going to Moe's, for beer! Have fun drinking your lemonade, babies!"
Homer,"Lisa, can Daddy borrow your bike?"
Homer,"Hey Moe, gimme a--"
Homer,Seymour... Edna asked me to talk to you.
Homer,"No, this is about you. Edna wants to break up."
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"Look at it this way: you're a free man... unlike me. You have all your hair... unlike me. No kids tying you down, or a crippling mortgage that you refinanced at twenty-six percent because a dancing internet cowboy told you to... Oh, God, I hate my life!"
Homer,"Exactly. You're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option?"
Homer,"Oh, I'm afraid Lenny's dead."
Homer,And you will again. Because he isn't really dead. And now this next piece of news won't seem so bad...
Homer,Y'ello!
Homer,The gay guy?
Homer,"Uh-huh, got it. Marge, I'm going to a hardcore gay club, and I won't be home till three in the morning!"
Homer,You'll always have a special place in his heart!
Homer,Anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone?
Homer,"Okay, everyone. Rotate one to your right."
Homer,"Sweet Conclusions Break-Up Service. Oh yes, we dispose of your loved one humanely - thanks to our patented TenderDump System."
Homer,I'll be there in thirty minutes... or your breakup is freeee!
Homer,"Marge, if I had a hundred dollars for every customer I'd broken up, I'd have exactly this amount. 'Cause that's what I charge!"
Homer,"I know this is hard on you, but in time you'll come to see it's for the best."
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,"Marge, I'm getting' out of the break-up business and I don't know if I'll ever sleep soundly again."
Homer,"Wow, so this is what this is."
Homer,Surely some holds are barred.
Homer,"Well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. Now if you'll excuse me..."
Homer,"Hey, what's going on?"
Homer,"Really? Well, I did bring this envelope full of money."
Homer,"And these days, betting in a bar is safer than any stock, bond or real estate investment."
Homer,I want you to put it all on my little girl. And parlay with the Asian kid.
Homer,What is it?
Homer,"She won! And like any prudent gambler, I know when to walk away: never!"
Homer,"And when you win, I win. I'll explain that to you on your deathbed."
Homer,You what?
Homer,"Right, right. But will it happen this time?"
Homer,Just be yourself.
Homer,I wanna change my bet... I'm going against my daughter.
Homer,Fine. I won't look you in the eye.
Homer,Have I made the bet yet?
Homer,"You know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental."
Homer,No.
Homer,Uh... the sun did that.
Homer,"Well, sweetie, Daddy made a little extra money betting against you in the crossword tournament. You'll understand when you're a parent placing large wagers against your own children. I hope you're not mad."
Homer,You sure you're not mad?
Homer,You sure you're not mad?
Homer,"Mr. Teddy, can you ask Lisa if she's mad? What's that, Mr. Teddy? You're saying that you know women? And that when women say they're not mad, they're madder than ever?"
Homer,She's gone. Can you drive me home? I'm a little drunk.
Homer,Lisa? Lisa?
Homer,"Lisa, sweetie... please, look at your Daddy."
Homer,Nooooooooooooooooo!
Homer,Yessssssssssssssss!
Homer,"Lisa's mad at me, and now she's using Marge's maiden name instead of mine."
Homer,Wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.
Homer,"Well, I had a little help from this guy."
Homer,"Dear Lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. Sorry, he told me I needed a hundred and forty-four letters. What was my point again? Oh right. Bouvier or Simpson, I cherish you."
Homer,Kitten calendar.
Homer,What does it do?
Homer,"Okay. What can I do for you? Please, I'm begging you!"
Homer,But it's glowing.
Homer,"Marge, I installed all the low energy bulbs!"
Homer,Disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!
Homer,"Milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... Salaam alaikum!"
Homer,Sir? That's the kind of respect you'd have to strangle out of an American kid.
Homer,I'm really thirty-eight.
Homer,"Hey, Bashir's great. If Derek Jeter married Mariah Carey, it wouldn't last, but I bet they'd have a kid like him."
Homer,"Oh, I can't believe that till I see a fictional TV program espousing your point of view."
Homer,Oh my God. What can I do?
Homer,But we're the more powerful country for a few more years.
Homer,I guess I have no choice.
Homer,"Here's the plan, Marge. You keep 'em talking. I'll be listening... and quietly judging."
Homer,"Ah, interesting. Why just the other day I was reading that science is used to make bombs."
Homer,Why don't I get us dessert?
Homer,I made us a little cake.
Homer,"Care to cut? Watch this, Lenny."
Homer,What's the matter? Don't like the taste of freedom?
Homer,"Shut up, old man."
Homer,That's it! Ruin a perfect evening!
Homer,I'm sorry -- it's just so fun and easy to judge people based on religion.
Homer,"Okay, I'll apologize."
Homer,"Up-bup-bup! Don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison."
Homer,I am sorry I suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. I hope we can move past this and...
Homer,Dynamite?! They are terrorists! Must leave quietly.
Homer,So far so good.
Homer,Marge! I was right! Everybody is whatever I think they are.
Homer,I saw them unloading dynamite!
Homer,"All right, sweetie. But if I wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it."
Homer,Now do Flanders!
Homer,Nooooooo!
Homer,Hm. Usually that ends the dream.
Homer,The power of dreaming has convinced me the threat is real!
Homer,Gotta prove the genie was right...
Homer,Oh my God!
Homer,I want to apologize for being such a jerk at dinner. And I thought the best way to do that would be to come to your house and poke around.
Homer,"Wait, wait, wait, wait... I read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests. Is that true?"
Homer,Praise be Oliver.
Homer,We'll look it up in the Corona.
Homer,"So... now that we're alone, um... death to America, right?"
Homer,"Homer, why are you really here?"
Homer,"Oh, look at that. We're out of almond paste. Don't get up. I'll grind the almonds myself."
Homer,A computer!
Homer,I'm in!
Homer,Springfield mall?!
Homer,They're gonna blow it up!
Homer,"Just lis-ten! I'm grinding them now! Ow! My finger! Ooh, here comes the ambulance! My, you're a handsome fellow. Just get in the ambulance, Mr. Simpson. We'll see to your finger. Why thank you."
Homer,Ow! My finger!
Homer,Everyone get out!
Homer,Run for your lives!
Homer,Run for your--
Homer,Uh... stay where you are!
Homer,Bart?
Homer,"Boy, don't blow up this mall! It has the cookie store that gives free samples!"
Homer,U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
Homer,What about the bridge?
Homer,Did we really need a bridge there?
Homer,I'll save you!
Homer,That banner has really paid for itself over the years.
Homer,"Oh no, no bees? Oooh, now who will sting me and walk all over my sandwiches?"
Homer,Pfft! Knew it.
Homer,Duh!
Homer,What?!
Homer,Bo-ring!
Homer,Flowers -- the painted whores of the plant world.
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"I never dreamed the future could be scary. Let's go, Lisa. We've got some worms to save!"
Homer,"Worms, bees, ticks, fleas... let's go, go, go!"
Homer,Animals can get sick?!
Homer,You're the nerd.
Homer,There's one on Lisa!
Homer,"Hold still, sweetie. Daddy will kill it. And this time no screw-ups."
Homer,"Marge, remember when we were talking about our worst fears?"
Homer,And mine was snakes and yours was...
Homer,"Really? I thought it was Lisa with a beard of bees. Well whatever, brace yourself."
Homer,The secret is not to swallow the stingers.
Homer,"They're just drones, Lisa. They only live for like five minutes anyway. And they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and Bart."
Homer,"Which used to be a beautiful, thriving greenhouse 'til I was hired to run it."
Homer,I knew it!
Homer,I'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.
Homer,Huh? But how are we supposed to combine the DNA of two strains of the same species?
Homer,You and me?
Homer,"Oh yeah, yeah, that's what I meant too. I have no... inclination..."
Homer,Yep.
Homer,And she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.
Homer,"Sweetie, I have a very special surprise for you."
Homer,"Your bees died days ago. These are their angry, mutant descendants. And they're tough enough to live in any environment."
Homer,"Hm, I'm not sure. Let me check."
Homer,Are you guys dangerous?
Homer,"A simple ""yes"" would've sufficed."
Homer,"Don't worry, Lisa. Where else are they gonna go?"
Homer,"When you're older, you'll miss these fun activities."
Homer,"Uh, 'cause no one's making me. Buh-bye."
Homer,Could've been. If we hadn't had kids.
Homer,"Toldja, Marge. Tol. Dja."
Homer,"Friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening. Also, if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it."
Homer,"Okay, honey. If it's that important to you, you said it."
Homer,"Use as many big words as possible. I call ""computer."" Bart, you can have ""doorbell."""
Homer,Hey! That was--
Homer,We... I... You come up with an excuse!
Homer,"If you say so, M'lord."
Homer,"If you'll show me to your bathroom, I'd like to pretend to wash my hands."
Homer,"When they make a movie from his books, does he get one, or two free tickets?"
Homer,"Hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?"
Homer,"Oh, I get it. Here's ten bucks."
Homer,What a racket.
Homer,"Well, that's Bart for ya."
Homer,"Seems like you and I are always talking about Bart, my son."
Homer,"Oh, that. We were actually just going out for brunch and I got lost. But don't worry, officer. We'll definitely have a talk with the boy."
Homer,I doubt it -- Friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules.
Homer,Wait!
Homer,Is it some place I have to put on a tie?
Homer,Is it a place I'd look overdressed if I did wear a tie?
Homer,What about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt?
Homer,"And you know what else, sweetie? You and your friend Princess Nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad."
Homer,"Okay, chapter one... uh... uh... writing is hard."
Homer,"No, he's ten days younger."
Homer,If he's lucky.
Homer,"The guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's God. Well, God doesn't need his own special day!"
Homer,"Sunday's the Lord's day, boy. Not God's. Completely different guy."
Homer,"If I had won Class President, I'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now."
Homer,"Yup -- back in high school, right before I met your mother. A simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation..."
Homer,Guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.
Homer,Tears of a clown.
Homer,"Exception that proves the rule. If losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. Watch, I'll prove it."
Homer,Angry nut coming through.
Homer,"Hey, Vance?"
Homer,"Great, thanks. Listen, settle a bet: behind that smile you're dying, right?"
Homer,Please! You've gotta have some secret agony! I bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.
Homer,No. Yes.
Homer,I'll just stick with my beer.
Homer,"Because when Vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life."
Homer,Why did you just exchange that look of guilt?
Homer,So there's a chance I actually won! I've got to dig up that ballot box!
Homer,Al Gore?
Homer,Ballots... stolen... real winner unknown... what is the truth?...
Homer,I've gotta know.
Homer,Lenny! Wake up!
Homer,That's not why I'm here. Get dressed.
Homer,California casual.
Homer,The ballot box?!
Homer,What will this box reveal? And what will I use this box for afterwards? Mismatched nuts and bolts? Recipes? I may never know.
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,", or woo hoo?"
Homer,Yes! I'm Senior Class President! I get a parking spot if the Assistant Principal isn't using it!
Homer,"Wait a second. If I'd been Class President like I was supposed to, I'd be the one with the big mansion and the color TVs and the hot wife!"
Homer,"Marge, I still would be married to you, but you would just be hotter."
Homer,"That's exactly what it means. And Dondelinger took that life away from me. And the taking of a life is murder. And the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but I'm gonna find Dondelinger and tell him I know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!"
Homer,Dondelinger!
Homer,"Dondelinger! I should have been Class President, but you stole the election from me."
Homer,"Yes! I want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame."
Homer,I respect your choice. Now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a Tom Collins.
Homer,"Virgin? What are you, a girl?"
Homer,"Now, Dondelinger, I want some answers."
Homer,You lie. You love me!
Homer,I don't feel much like eating. I'll never know what would've happened if I'd have been Class President.
Homer,Huh? Who said that?
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"I would've been a winner, instead of some idiot spending his Saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce. Why did fate do this to me?"
Homer,Why? Why?
Homer,"Come on, stir! I must see more!"
Homer,"Marge, unlike C.P.R., this is something I must know."
Homer,...Debbie Pinson.
Homer,"Hey, Debbie, um... Wanna go to prom with me?"
Homer,"I got the biggest lapels, the ruffliest shirt, and the most beautiful...girl?!"
Homer,"Debbie, I forgot I have an English paper due on Monday. Would you read ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" for me and if you could write down how Boo Radley fits into the Southern Gothic tradition, that would be great."
Homer,Homer Simpson. Class President.
Homer,"A lot of great things have happened to me lately, but they're nothing compared to meeting you. May I have this dance?"
Homer,"Sorry, Debbie. I hope you can find happiness without me."
Homer,"I do! Oh, right."
Homer,"Marge, the way I feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline."
Homer,Sweet dreams.
Homer,"Thank you, mysterious weirdo."
Homer,I'm Class President.
Homer,"How you doin', Dad?"
Homer,"Honey, I'm home! Where are the kids?"
Homer,"Uh, yes. That must be it. This is the best of all possible worlds. Blah, blah, blah."
Homer,I wanna live in the sauce!
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Oh, I get it. You're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right?"
Homer,Are you kidding? We couldn't even convince you that Bruce Wayne is Batman.
Homer,"Oh, come on! That millionaire playboy? He's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the Wayne foundation."
Homer,"Oh, look who thinks he's smarter than sauce."
Homer,"Oh, why would you bring me here?! It's like bringing Richard Nixon to the Watergate! Or Kevin Costner to Waterworld!"
Homer,My own plaque! And one for Vice President Butthead! Cool.
Homer,"Is that why you brought me here, spirits?"
Homer,I guess that would be nice.
Homer,Really? Sure.
Homer,"Thanks, guys."
Homer,"Hey, was there another plaque here before?"
Homer,Now let's get something to eat.
Homer,God no!
Homer,"Ooh, that sounds like fun!"
Homer,"...three, two, one. Happy New Year!"
Homer,You're the government's problem now!
Homer,Who taught you that language?!
Homer,So you did learn something.
Homer,"Absolutely. Insurance is the greatest deal ever. If I get hurt, I get paid. And man, do I get hurt."
Homer,What a week.
Homer,Oh no! Now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp?
Homer,Great jokes make me hungry. I wonder what's in the pantry...
Homer,Wait a minute...
Homer,Wait a minute...
Homer,Must be in the glove box.
Homer,This was due two weeks ago! I'm not insured! For the first time in my life I'm financially responsible for my own actions!
Homer,Uninsured! Uninsured!
Homer,"I'm not in good hands! I'm in no hands! Like a bad neighbor, no one is there!"
Homer,Dear. Stupid. Insurance. Company. I. Meant. To. Mail this. On time. What. Do You. Mean. Too bad? Screw. You! Heh. Heh.
Homer,"I won't be insured until three o'clock?! Okay, until then, I have to avoid any serious injuries or accidents on my property, or I'm ruined."
Homer,Oh no you don't!
Homer,"Marge, I won't bore you with the truth. All I can say is that until three p.m., we must avoid all accidents and injuries or we're all going to the poor house."
Homer,Fine. Back. And we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.
Homer,"Me too, baby. But we gotta get real."
Homer,"Book club? That's the most stupid boring thing ever. Oh, thank you."
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,"I mean, nooo!"
Homer,"Okay, I just have to keep these tipsy witches safe for ten more seconds."
Homer,Kniiiife!
Homer,Got it!
Homer,"Oh, Mr. Burns! Why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time."
Homer,"So, plans for the weekend?"
Homer,"Marge, are you mad I forgot to send in the payment?"
Homer,"Baby, I hope you've got snuggle insurance, 'cause I'm about to file a claim."
Homer,OH MARDI GRAS / OH MARDI GRAS / YOU SEE A LOT OF BOO-BIES...
Homer,"Boy, where are my zydeco records?"
Homer,"I know they do, but the Simpson Mardi Gras party has been a tradition since two days before you were born. And we spare no expense."
Homer,This counts as that.
Homer,"Ladies, how're you doing with the float?"
Homer,No problem.
Homer,"Marge, lighten up. Even Grampa's enjoying himself."
Homer,"Ha, ha! Eat my food! Drink up my drink! Put your coat on my daughter's bed! I command you!"
Homer,Fine. I'll invite him. But he has to wear the outfit I choose.
Homer,"Hey, Flanders. Listen, uh... we're having a party..."
Homer,"So, anyway, if you're not doing anything, and it looks like you are, you're welcome to stop by, or not."
Homer,"Because I have this magical thing called a Home Equity loan. I borrow all the money I want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. Sucker."
Homer,"Fine, Mr. Skeptical. Give me back your beads."
Homer,"Beads, please."
Homer,"Marge, don't worry. It's like when we stopped paying the phone bill. They stopped calling us. In fact, everyone did!"
Homer,Oh man. Who'd think the first day of Lent would be such a bummer?
Homer,"Listen, you! When you gave me that money, you said I wouldn't have to repay it till the future! This isn't the future! It's the lousy, stinking now!"
Homer,That poor man. Is he okay?
Homer,"Don't worry honey, we'll come out ahead. I ripped all the copper wire out of the walls."
Homer,Did I what now?
Homer,Goodbye.
Homer,"Let's go, kids. I can't watch any more."
Homer,"And on the zillionth day, God created hugs."
Homer,And it was gooood.
Homer,"Uh, uh, uh, uh, better let me go first. I left a little uh ""surprise"" upstairs for the new owner."
Homer,HE SAVED OUR ASS!
Homer,No problem. Just let Sir Fix-a-lot slay this chore.
Homer,Next problem.
Homer,It's so beautiful. No two are exactly alike. Though many of them are very similar.
Homer,"I'm back, baby!"
Homer,"He what?! Flanders, landlords like you are the scum of the earth! You lounge around in your Egg MacMansions and we never see you unless the rent check's late!"
Homer,"Some friend you are. The minute you become our landlord, you expect us to pay rent. You'd better just pray I don't find out where you live!"
Homer,Bart! Don't forget to turn the chicken!
Homer,"Yeah, you'd treat her right."
Homer,"Oh, right -- like ""Dateline"" did to you!"
Homer,We live in a house that is trying to kill us.
Homer,"Who is this ""Dad"" you speak of, Lisa Simpson?"
Homer,Yes.
Homer,...Squeaky stair here... scary portrait there...
Homer,Poltergeist in the closet...
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,I'm the victim here!
Homer,Kadiddlehopper.
Homer,Fine. You're mad. What are you gonna do about it?
Homer,Fine. I'll get another neighbor to buy the house and let us live in it!
Homer,"Flanders, you wouldn't throw us out on Christmas, would you?"
Homer,"It is me, Jesus!"
Homer,I have come from my workshop in the North Pole to say: don't evict the Simpsons!
Homer,It was... um... do you have a computer nearby?
Homer,He's nailing something to our door.
Homer,"Ew, that's gross."
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge."
Homer,"According to this chapter book, we have a secret weapon: ""Evictee will be granted a stay of eviction if said household includes a resident aged sixty-five or over."" Finally, a practical use for my father."
Homer,I'm using you!
Homer,My own devices!
Homer,"Hey, Flanders. You can't evict us because a senior's living here now."
Homer,Will you kids knock it off? I'm trying to watch badminton!
Homer,"Well, I guess we can take a quick walk. We'll keep Grampa occupied with this DVD of Dwight Eisenhower talking about golf."
Homer,"So, after I paid for the ice cream cones, I said ""thank you"" and was on my way."
Homer,"I know it seems that way, because I'm such a vivid storyteller. Now here's another story called ""Bart's Mistake."" We were walking home when"
Homer,How could this have happened?
Homer,"Well, I can't compete with that!"
Homer,"Honey, don't cry. It could be worse -- at least it's not raining!"
Homer,"See, I told you, it's not raining. So we're just homeless."
Homer,"Kids, if you get lost, remember where we are: seventy-five beds from that wall, and a hundred beds from the crazy guy."
Homer,That's not true. You have bug bites you can scratch.
Homer,"Oh, Flanders, I promise I'll never abuse our friendship again."
Homer,Never! Hooray for Stupid Flanders!
Homer,I really hate this neighborhood.
Homer,"Yeah, right! And I'm married to Wonder Woman!"
Homer,"No, I'm gonna see it first!"
Homer,My space toy!
Homer,We'll be talking about this together for years!
Homer,I finally feel like part of a family!
Homer,"Don't worry, honey, I'll be your ""seeing-eye Homer."" We're in some kind of doctor room, bunch of stuff on the walls... it's kind of hard to describe... Um, I'm gonna take my break now."
Homer,Wolves are taking all our women.
Homer,You just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.
Homer,Is there any other way to enter a kitchen?
Homer,"Aw, rats in the kitchen. Just like that delightful movie I taped in the theater."
Homer,"Ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots Vichy."
Homer,"Hmmm, this is good."
Homer,"Good, but not great. I'll go get some rat poison."
Homer,"No, you stupid dog -- that's Maggie's bunny!"
Homer,Not in front of the poison man!
Homer,"Whoever's biting me, stop it!"
Homer,Why did I bring the baby and the dog to the poison store?
Homer,How am I gonna get us all across this river?
Homer,A boat!
Homer,"Oh, we're too heavy."
Homer,"Let's see: I need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but I can only take one thing at a time. I can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and I can't leave the dog alone with the baby."
Homer,Can't someone help me with this puzzle?
Homer,Professor Frink! Help me figure this out!
Homer,Yo! Over here!
Homer,"Great time to nap, Einstein!"
Homer,"Okay, Maggie, dog, poison, you're all involved, so listen up. First I row Maggie over, leaving the dog and the poison. Then I row back alone, take the poison over and bring Maggie back. Then I take the dog over, come back, get Maggie, row across, and before I know it, I'm back at home!"
Homer,Were you listening at all?
Homer,"Now, I need to leave you where you'll be safe...under the watchful eyes of God. And I'll be watching you too, in case God's busy making tornadoes or not existing."
Homer,I see you! I see you!
Homer,I see--
Homer,Catholics!
Homer,Give me my baby back!
Homer,'Cause she was fighting my dog and stealing my poison. Now give her back so I can take her home to my rat-infested house!
Homer,"Come on, lady, have a heart. I screwed up! I'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes!"
Homer,"Kids, I have to tell your Mom I lost Maggie."
Homer,"Oh no, oh no, ohhh no. There is no way Homer Simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun."
Homer,Told you there was no way I would do it.
Homer,Are you sure you don't want me to do it? 'Cause I can do it. I got the outfit right here.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Um... No problem, sweetie."
Homer,Cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
Homer,"No, Marge. You're the most giving person I know. Besides, i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne."
Homer,"You told me something, but I wasn't listening!"
Homer,"Fair enough! Kids, let's practice."
Homer,Mi-mi-mi-miiiii!
Homer,"That was good, but Lisa, you're still complaining from your throat, not your diaphragm."
Homer,Maybe it's beef stew!
Homer,Hot tubs!
Homer,"Guys, what's it like?"
Homer,I want to buy your fanciest hot tub!
Homer,"Please, can I get it, Marge? Please? Please?"
Homer,"Beats me. / I'unno. / Please, please, please!"
Homer,I'm on it.
Homer,Go back to your day spas!
Homer,Interesting proposal. Now with an opposing point of view: bubbles.
Homer,"Hey, Flanders! Why don't you join us? Afraid you'll get your moustache wet?"
Homer,Hmm. Probably a reminder to relax more.
Homer,"Hey, what happened to the bubbles?"
Homer,"Oh Dad, I never knew you had dreams, or emotions."
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, who said anything about a jar?"
Homer,"Okay... ""Pitch in the Negro Leagues,"" I can think of at least two problems with that... can't read that one, my thumb's over it..."
Homer,Have one more beer at O'Flanagan's Pub... We'll do that one!
Homer,This place is in Ireland?!
Homer,Lousy old man -- makin' me look up at an airplane!
Homer,"Sir, I brought my father thousands of miles just to drink at your bar."
Homer,Gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!
Homer,"You okay, Dad?"
Homer,"Oh, I miss her."
Homer,"Well, Dad, was there anything on your list about being cheated by an Irishman?"
Homer,"Hey, boyo -- how about a tall cool one? How about you, Greensleeves? Irishmen love to get drunk."
Homer,"Who are you, stuttering Fonzie? What about you, bicycle pants?"
Homer,Why you...
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Our first sale!
Homer,Our first refund.
Homer,"Yeah, look at 'em crowding the bar! There's Sully, and Mack, Jimmy D. and Jimmy B.! What can I get ya, boys -- the usual?"
Homer,We are so screwed!
Homer,Ireland doesn't like pubs anymore. It's as if Danish people stopped liking sleek modern design.
Homer,"Well, we need help. Someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm."
Homer,"Moe, something terrible has happened! The Irish have become hardworking and sober!"
Homer,"So, what can't people do in modern Ireland?"
Homer,People can't smoke indoors in Ireland!
Homer,"Moe, you were right!"
Homer,"Well, ""Da,"" it looks like all your ""der"" have come ""ter."""
Homer,I can't tell if those are questions or statements.
Homer,"Don't worry, Dad. We'll get out. America is the New York Yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand."
Homer,It was apt.
Homer,"Let me say I've always admired the Irish. Knute Rockne, Larry Bird, and especially Mr. Potato Head."
Homer,"But I ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on Expectant Mothers drink free night?"
Homer,"So I hope you'll forgive two well-meaning Americans for trying to take Ireland back to the good old days of ""Angela's Ashes."" Thank you."
Homer,"Oh my God, she fainted! Let's go get smelling salts!"
Homer,Suckers!
Homer,"Reverend Lovejoy? You deliver pizza now? But we didn't order a pizza. But you forgot the pizza anyway. Marge, the pizza place screwed up again."
Homer,"You don't get it, Padre. My old lady and I have a thing goin' on. We don't need a piece of paper to keep it real."
Homer,I need that paper quick!
Homer,Why you little bastard...
Homer,"Sweetie, any place I'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world."
Homer,"Marge, this time I'm going to give you the wedding you deserve. Let's get out of here!"
Homer,"Hello. It's me, Lance Romance."
Homer,Your first mission is to look out the window.
Homer,"Marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. So -- will you marry me -- in style?"
Homer,"Did you hear that, Santa? She said yes! Yes! Now, back to your cold, airless tomb."
Homer,How'd you check?!
Homer,"Check out this rocket ship cake, Marge."
Homer,Maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. And that would be a big surprise because I'd forget about it pretty quick.
Homer,Chocolate.
Homer,What if we...
Homer,"But there is, Marge! The first two letters..."
Homer,Why not?
Homer,"Marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. I think you're becoming a... Bridezilla."
Homer,"No matter what I do, Marge yells at me. If she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married?"
Homer,What's going on? What's with all the darkness? Hello? Marge! Where am I?
Homer,What the? I'm chained up like a common bicycle!
Homer,Who would do this to me?! It would have to be someone who could afford a chain.
Homer,But I have to marry Marge!
Homer,"Just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression."
Homer,I miss you so much.
Homer,"You idiot! How am I ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is!"
Homer,"To get the key I have to lick through a lollipop? Oh, how awful."
Homer,What the?
Homer,Whose side are you on?
Homer,Malge! Ahmiss oo. Ahmiss oo so mug...
Homer,"I'm gonna say this for the last time: Bart, if this is one of your pranks, very funny."
Homer,"What's fun about fire ants? They're-- Oh, you're being sarcastic."
Homer,"Thank you, that's very... More sarcasm."
Homer,Just see that my fiancée Marge gets this -- my wedding vows.
Homer,Marge! Moe and Maya are here for a double date.
Homer,"Marge, I hope this day is as perfect for you, as the day we met was for me. You always find the one grain of sugar in the salt shaker that is I. With each marriage I get a little better -- maybe after a thousand, I'll be worthy of you."
Homer,"I miss you. I miss the kids. God help me, I even miss your sisters."
Homer,"I'm not sure what happened. I was kidnapped, then tortured, then I fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. When I awoke, I felt refreshed. Then I was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn."
Homer,Won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath?
Homer,"I'm sorry, honey. I wanted so badly to give you a fancy wedding."
Homer,A rocket ship wedding cake -- just what I always wanted!
Homer,I love to see this!
Homer,"This is no time to pat the bunny, Maggie. Daddy's watching a very important Mid-Atlantic Hockey League Conference Semi-Final do-over game."
Homer,"Stop him, Babando!"
Homer,"I will, when it's not sports season. I just want to know how the game ends."
Homer,Wha-wha-what's the score?!
Homer,"The score, damn you!"
Homer,I will never... know... the score!
Homer,"Oh, Marge. This is a definite high point for our marriage."
Homer,Yes?
Homer,"That's ridiculous. Who's your daddy, Maggie? Who's your daddy?"
Homer,He is pretty good with her.
Homer,Look Marge! It's just what you want. Me spending the day with Muggsy.
Homer,"Marge, you're not naggy. You just set the bar impossibly high."
Homer,"Impossibly high. Now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever!"
Homer,Not even heated up. Typical dog.
Homer,"This is it, Maggie -- the place where Daddy goes every morning."
Homer,"Now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while Daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder."
Homer,"Moe, what are you doing?"
Homer,"Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. Whaddaya say, Maggie?"
Homer,"Aw, her first enabling."
Homer,Hello Maggie... hello Maggie.
Homer,"Ooh, Maggie made some new friends."
Homer,"Aw, burrowing your head into your Daddy. A sign that my baby is happy and confident."
Homer,"I can too! ""There once was this guy from an island off the coast of Massachusetts... uh, Nantucket, I think it was. Anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh..."
Homer,There you are!
Homer,Aww. Innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. How sweet. Maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.
Homer,How would I know?
Homer,"I have not! Oh right, you think I do."
Homer,"Pleased to meet you. Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that I can't help wondering about."
Homer,"In a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?"
Homer,"Man oh man, slap a ring on that!"
Homer,"Here we are, Maggie. That park you love..."
Homer,See you when the moon comes out.
Homer,"Man, that made me thirsty."
Homer,"I'll save you, Maggie!"
Homer,I'm telling!
Homer,Now what?
Homer,"Aw, sweetie, you saved me. Well, I promise that wherever you go in this world, I will always be there for you."
Homer,"Oh Maggie, I love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. God bless your mother for making you with me."
Homer,"Whatcha watchin', honey?"
Homer,And I'm good at beginnings.
Homer,Not a thing in the world.
Homer,"Moe, this was a great thing for you. You went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. And sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means someone can love you again. And that'll make you smile."
Homer,"Well, I'm glad they suspended Milhouse. He's a bad influence on you."
Homer,"You know, I think Milhouse is ""El Barto."" Hmmmm."
Homer,"And now, you're gonna visit your Grampa while I park around the corner and take a nap."
Homer,Don't shake your fist at me!
Homer,Boy.
Homer,"Look, man, I don't want any trouble. C'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. Leave me alone, okay?"
Homer,"Oh, it's even worse when you know it has a name."
Homer,"Marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. That's the most a parent can do."
Homer,We done here?
Homer,"Yeah, busboys get all the chicks."
Homer,"Son, girls come and go. But you'll always have your family."
Homer,"I know, I know."
Homer,Big deal! I could juggle five pins if they let me use a unicycle.
Homer,'Ut 'uz it 'ay?
Homer,"Oh man, I love Saturdays!"
Homer,"Oh, this is great, honey. Thanks for telling me about it. I hope you don't mind I invited Lenny."
Homer,"Ooh, lamb-kebab!"
Homer,"Ooh, chicken-kebab!"
Homer,"Ooh, fire-kebab!"
Homer,Water!
Homer,Why... you... little...!
Homer,"Burn, Barty, burn!"
Homer,Is it 'omplimentawee?
Homer,"It is? 'Ey every-ody, 'eck out I 'ompliment!"
Homer,"I held up two, for ""peely!"""
Homer,"Well, at least I can eat again!"
Homer,"Mmm, cherry."
Homer,Too much cherry!
Homer,"Ooh, lemon. That'll stop the cherry."
Homer,"Doctor, why is this happening to me?"
Homer,I can't eat tacos?! Oh my God -- what day of Mayo is it?
Homer,Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!
Homer,I still taste over-tones of pink!
Homer,Hm. It feels like food. But it has no flavor whatsoever.
Homer,What else do they got?
Homer,"Man, who comes up with this stuff?"
Homer,Don't have one.
Homer,"Son, from now on, I'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!"
Homer,"Oh, come on, relax, I won't embarrass you."
Homer,"Uh... can I work it off? Don't worry, I won't embarrass you."
Homer,"OH, I'M BIG AND YELLOW / AND I'M SERVIN' JELL-O / IF YOU'RE A FELLOW AND YOU WANT SOME JELL-O / YOU'D BETTER BELLOW / HEY, BIG GUY / GIMME SOME JELL-O"
Homer,"Up-bup-bup. No Jell-o for you, Bart -- it'll keep you up at night. Like last week when you crawled into bed with me and Mommy?"
Homer,Sure is hot back here.
Homer,"Hey, there we go."
Homer,"Don't worry, I won't embarrass you."
Homer,"Buddy, I'm here to eat, not make interesting conversation."
Homer,"Well, I know when I'm not wanted. Am I wanted?"
Homer,"Hi, Homer Simpson. Mind if I sit near your son? Mine sucks."
Homer,"Wow, he's terrified of you."
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you come to school to help him get good grades? Isn't that why we pay public school teachers those enormous salaries?"
Homer,Well I hope your son enjoys being driven around by the President of the United States.
Homer,"Yeah, you don't see many presidents doing that. Maybe L.B.J. -- you know, at the end."
Homer,"I don't have to ""helicopter"" Bart -- I've got a backup plan called ""Lisa."""
Homer,"Oh my God, my son's a loser and my daughter's a loner. Way to go, Marge!"
Homer,"Marge, where have you been?"
Homer,No time. I'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head.
Homer,That makes sense. Movin' on.
Homer,"...if we don't get more involved in their lives, Bart and Lisa are gonna be failures. Failures who work for... Noah!"
Homer,Aren't you the one that usually worries about stuff?
Homer,"If Marge doesn't worry about the kids... then that leaves... me! Help me, mayonnaise!"
Homer,Look at all these helicopter parents. I hope Bart's doing okay on his own.
Homer,There's no future in that!
Homer,A thousand dollars?! That's what my house is worth!
Homer,"Time to take control of my son's life. Let's see, what can he build..."
Homer,Too obvious.
Homer,Gotta be something from Earth.
Homer,You're no help.
Homer,Perfect!
Homer,I did it! I helped my son! Helicopter Homer away!
Homer,Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!
Homer,"Lisa, I found this book in the ""What's Wrong With My Daughter"" section of the bookstore."
Homer,It tells you how you can get popular.
Homer,"Sweetie, our country was founded by a clique: the Continental Congress. Dolphins swim in cliques. Those are my two examples."
Homer,"And to show you how this book works, I will demonstrate on some rats..."
Homer,"Let's try what chapter seven calls ""Un-sults"" -- insults disguised as compliments. Hey, Lenny -- it takes a lot of courage to wear suspenders when you're not in the circus."
Homer,"See, it works. And un-sults are just the beginning. There's also envy-tations, hate-hugs, spamming with faint praise and... Hey everyone, wanna go get frozen yogurt?"
Homer,"Ooo, I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't mean everyone everyone. Hope you don't mind."
Homer,"And that, my dear girl, is called the Toledo Take-back."
Homer,"I see. Well, maybe you're not ready for this book. It is more of a big girl thing."
Homer,Enough to build a Washington Monument.
Homer,What cologne are you wearing? None of your business! Now we'd like our Washington Monument to be one five-hundredth the size of the real one.
Homer,What do you mean? And who are you?
Homer,"But, you..."
Homer,What's the hardest model there is?
Homer,"Attention parents, children and childless weirdoes. My son and I are going to build Westminster Abbey!"
Homer,"Hey, how hard can it be? All we have to do is follow the directions."
Homer,"Marge, the boy and I will be making Westminster Abbey."
Homer,"But first, as part of ""Operation Popularity,"" Lisa and I are hosting a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party in the back yard."
Homer,Brittany and Kaitlin are here! Where's my spray-on tan?
Homer,Ant poison? Why do I always read the labels after?
Homer,"Ladies, we've got it all. Rhinestones, stickers, tassels... everything to make those hundred dollar phones look like five dollar toys."
Homer,I am such a great parent to both my kids.
Homer,"Hello, little girl, who do you belong to?"
Homer,"Hey boy, why don't I do that for you?"
Homer,All the other parents are doing it for their kids. Now stand back and I'll take it from here. A little further back.
Homer,"Naw, that kinda creeps me out."
Homer,Must finish Poet's Corner... or Bart will work for Noah... with his hot mom...
Homer,"That's not Henry the Seventh, it's Henry the Sixth! Stupid, stupid, stupid!"
Homer,Geoffrey Chaucer?! What are you doing here?
Homer,Anne of Cleves!
Homer,Oscar Wilde?
Homer,But that makes no sense!
Homer,Shut up!
Homer,"Whatever happened to ""boo?"""
Homer,Now we could smash the real Westminster Abbey so it looks like this.
Homer,There are no flights to London till five!
Homer,"Yes! Yes! In your face, losers! This helicopter is taking off!"
Homer,I'm sorry. I got carried away. From now on the only thing I'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. But at least I made Lisa popular.
Homer,I H-8 this?
Homer,"Yeah, it's clear to me now the best thing I can do as a parent is simply check out."
Homer,"Lisa, a light bulb is either on or it's off."
Homer,That's what the dimmer switch companies want you to think.
Homer,"I tried to fix the kids' lives, but instead I led them to rich and rewarding personal decisions of their own."
Homer,That mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar?
Homer,It was stuffed with cash!
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,I feel like I've died and gone to Hell.
Homer,"I can't understand that math reference, because I went to Springfield Elementary!"
Homer,"We can't afford to move to Waverly Hills! Their house prices have commas in them. As it is, our lawn is just green-painted cement."
Homer,"Oh, elementary school friends -- those are forever! You're always gonna be friends with Milhouse. STAND BY ME / OH, STAND BY ME..."
Homer,"I need to rent an apartment in the worst part of Waverly Hills -- the crappier, the better."
Homer,Ahso sheepay to you.
Homer,I can't afford this place -- it's way too fancy.
Homer,Sometimes there's not a train going by.
Homer,Four walls? I was thinking more of something in a two or three.
Homer,"Yeah, um, well, I'm looking at a lot of murder sites right now. Where's the bedroom?"
Homer,Tempting. Tempting. Where's the bathroom?
Homer,I'll take it!
Homer,WAVERLY HILLS / THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE / SQUATTING IN WAVERLY HILLS. / WAVERLY HILLS / GET EDUCATION FRAUDULENTLY / MOOCHIN' OFF WAVERLY HILLS.
Homer,Ha! I can see them now with their bald heads and their blue-haired wives. How I despise them.
Homer,"Heads. I mean, tails. I mean, on its side."
Homer,That's not enough.
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"Goodnight, Marge."
Homer,When do I get to move back home?
Homer,The heat is off. The hissing from the radiator is a snake.
Homer,That's another twenty or thirty years.
Homer,Where am I?
Homer,That was great. You mind if I use that at work?
Homer,"Well, I love to play, but I'm not very good. Also, I always forget to cash my chips back in for money."
Homer,You make words into dudes.
Homer,Your hair smells nice!
Homer,S'open!
Homer,Marge! I'm glad you came. There's a kegger down the hall. We can go as soon as I desecrate this corpse.
Homer,"Eat butt, skyboy-ninety-four! I'm sorry, Marge. Where are my manners? Did you want to taunt my kill also? Press the X button."
Homer,I'll get us some brewskies.
Homer,"Cup, m'lady? Or would you care to funnel it down thy throat?"
Homer,Foam wasn't spilt in a day.
Homer,"Two, actually. Twins."
Homer,I was an astronaut for a little bit. So many rules.
Homer,Listen... I got a place down the hall.
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,We're not the only ones having a good time.
Homer,Maybe you could come over again. I'll cook you my special microwave burritos. I stop the oven when the middle is still a little bit frozen.
Homer,"How 'bout you, me and my wife have a two-way?"
Homer,Try the Flan De Leche De Cabra...
Homer,Be sure to dig around in the gunk.
Homer,Why can't I have it now? You got your present here. Basic fairness dictates... ...oh!
Homer,Where are my videogames? My X-box?! My Wii?!
Homer,"You know, you're starting to remind me a lot of my first wife."
Homer,What movie?
Homer,I went to a movie.
Homer,I drove.
Homer,Sometimes I think this fifty square foot apartment isn't big enough for the both of us!
Homer,"Thank you, Friendo."
Homer,"But, I thought... you said..."
Homer,I can't leave my bachelor pad! My bros'll miss me!
Homer,Why do you watch comedies if you don't want to hear more jokes?
Homer,"What do you think, Marge? Maybe we've outgrown our first apartment."
Homer,"C'mon, boy! Be cool!"
Homer,Be cool or you're grounded!
Homer,"Marge, I need some bribe money!"
Homer,"Thanks, Marge. But don't forget, there's still gonna be a civil suit."
Homer,"Well, I may be playing a tree but at least I'm getting my face out there."
Homer,"Hey, there's no way I could ever be as good as that guy."
Homer,You're not suggesting... murder.
Homer,"Whatever you say, sweetie."
Homer,A prop knife!
Homer,"He who laughs last, laughs dead."
Homer,Why does everyone around here talk that crazy talk?
Homer,"Well, if you see him in heaven, tell him he sucks."
Homer,"Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more / By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis... uh, To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow... today's Tuesday, so that would make it Friday, and then, uh... Shakespeare!"
Homer,Conrad Birdie? Coming here to Sweet Apple?!
Homer,"""Dammit, Morpheus. Not everyone believes what you believe."""
Homer,I can't wait for the reviews!
Homer,Who the hell is Banquo?
Homer,Wouldn't it be easier if I just took acting lessons?
Homer,That's inspiring. What's that from? X-Men 2?
Homer,Mac-who?
Homer,Why do they write a new review of this play every single day?
Homer,"No, dear. I'm a man, dear."
Homer,KILLING MAKES ME HUN-GRY
Homer,EATING MAKES ME THIRS-TY
Homer,DRINKING MAKES ME SLEE-PY
Homer,"Well, at least you can't nag me anymore."
Homer,Ow!
Homer,It's my moment.
Homer,"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools. The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player. That struts and frets his hour upon the stage. And then is heard no more."
Homer,Me having to read all those plays would be the real tragedy.
Homer,"Goodbye, fat me."
Homer,"I don't know how you put up with all these kids, Toohey. If I were you there'd be a lot of strangled babies."
Homer,"Can you help me out? I need change for a dollar. Oh, I also need a dollar."
Homer,Great! Do you want to see me naked?
Homer,"Let's go around the table, and everybody say one amazing thing that happened to them today. Lisa?"
Homer,"Great. Okay. Marge, go."
Homer,You? Awesome. Next.
Homer,"Eh, they can go to Hell. Bart?"
Homer,"Time's up! Okay, Maggie: ""suck, suck,"" that takes us to... me."
Homer,Some Hollywood idiots hired me to star in a movie!
Homer,Fine. I'll give back the Oscars I stole from the lobby.
Homer,Do you want the Golden Globe?
Homer,"I don't know if I can. I'm a yo-yo dieter: ""Yo, hot dog man!"" ""Yo, peanuts!"" Why aren't you laughing? Don't you know what ""yo"" means?"
Homer,"Finally, the answer to my problem. What do you do?"
Homer,"Hm, they look good with a little meat on their bones."
Homer,Because I'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?
Homer,"Yeah, well you don't always have time to masturbate ."
Homer,"Oh, that song's a little on the nose. Can we do it to David Bowie's ""Heroes?"""
Homer,This montage sounds really exhausting. How 'bout I just do a walking around sad montage?
Homer,A montage of me turning a ragtag Little League team into state runners-up?
Homer,"Me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? Then I get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then I see the driver is a chicken?"
Homer,"Ten thousand one, ten thousand two... aaaand fit."
Homer,Was that Tobey Maguire?
Homer,But how will I keep from overeating?
Homer,Found this on the roof.
Homer,"What'd you think, kids?"
Homer,Your other hand.
Homer,"This life is the greatest. I get paid a fortune, I've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, and I get to hire my friends."
Homer,A lot of things come and go in life. But not fame and fitness.
Homer,Is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?
Homer,But you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants.
Homer,He's gone.
Homer,One cheese cube couldn't hurt.
Homer,"Oh. This other cheese cube's stuck to the first one. Well, that still technically counts as one."
Homer,It's bad luck to eat an even number of cheese cubes.
Homer,Don't look at me. Don't look at me!
Homer,You. You watch.
Homer,"Well, one thing's for sure: I'm not Everyman."
Homer,Oh Marge! I'm ready for some lovin'!
Homer,"Marge, speak to me."
Homer,"Nag, nag, nag."
Homer,"Apu, I have to lose weight now. Do you have anything that'll make me vomit?"
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"How ya doin', man?"
Homer,I'm right here! I've been here all along!
Homer,What happened is you left! Who did you leave me for? Tell me. I can take it.
Homer,I knew it!
Homer,Just you and me?
Homer,That could work.
Homer,You just said both those things to me.
Homer,I'm so cold.
Homer,"Okay, now I'll be the dog and you be the daddy."
Homer,"Okay look, there's a big football game on tonight, so we can get this thing over real quick. Show me some of Bart's artwork, give me a little false hope, and here's a little something to help with his grades."
Homer,I'm not asking for A's. Just incompletes.
Homer,It will be his last birthday if he keeps drawing pictures like this.
Homer,"I said, are there any areas that we, his parents, can improve upon?"
Homer,You're the first teacher that ever got me.
Homer,No... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.
Homer,"Hm, I don't know -- kernels are kind of big."
Homer,"When you say ""teacher,"" do you really mean ""parent?"""
Homer,"Great. Go nuts. But remember, we never had this discussion."
Homer,"The one we just had about you doing bad things, you stupid kid! Ohhh."
Homer,Woo hoo! There's no better violence than self-inflicted violence!
Homer,"Not everyone has a deathbed, son -- you could die suddenly."
Homer,Maybe.
Homer,Ask him.
Homer,"Ah yes, filthy, but obscure. With a subtle scatological undertone."
Homer,"Pay the man, boy."
Homer,"Now listen, son, I know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight, but remember: don't try this at home. Do it at the schoolyard. Someplace where, if you get hurt, we can sue, not just them, but the school, the county, the state, and that jackass Joe Biden."
Homer,Kill! Kill. Kill.
Homer,"Ultimate Punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. Studies have shown your mother is right."
Homer,It wasn't just a piece -- it was the whole cake! Frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a Bavarian castle!
Homer,I couldn't help it! She knew my one weakness -- that I'm weak!
Homer,"Five, six / Who's got tix?"
Homer,What'd I miss?
Homer,"Yeah, Marge. He'll knock your block off. Your beautiful block."
Homer,"Listen: of all the crazy things I've ever done, this is the craziest. And you're doing it."
Homer,"Watch your language, moron."
Homer,How can I control her?! I have nothing to withhold!
Homer,"We've gotta get Marge some professional training. Carl, do you know heavyweight champ Drederick Tatum?"
Homer,"Well, I... uh..."
Homer,I'll bash him with this book!
Homer,Marge... I bet we've got ten minutes till the kids wake up.
Homer,There certainly is.
Homer,Marge Simpson reporting for duty!
Homer,"Uh, Moe, I have a confession to make: I'm just Homer dressed as Marge."
Homer,"Well, you'd better not leave me and talk to your old friends all night."
Homer,"Marge, I tried my best to talk you out of this. But since you're going through with it, I beg you, just stay out of his way and don't get hurt."
Homer,"I'll save you, Marge!"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Ooo, ooo, can I go, Marge? Can I? Can I?"
Homer,No holds barred.
Homer,The math checks out!
Homer,"Well, we're not going out to help him. We have no idea what hideous creatures might be out there!"
Homer,How do I know you're not a muncher?
Homer,I can't make sense of that muncher talk!
Homer,Really?
Homer,Then we must keep this boy safe from harm!
Homer,Better call Dr. Hibbert.
Homer,You mean tell her I love her? Or I meaning you?
Homer,I'll just high-five her.
Homer,"Now remember, no loud noises. Oh man, that breeze feels good!"
Homer,To the panic room!
Homer,To the panic room store!
Homer,Another politician who can't keep his promises.
Homer,"Well, this day can't get any crazier."
Homer,"Well, well, well."
Homer,Who's an unproductive worker now?
Homer,Got your nose.
Homer,Why you...
Homer,"I think the better brains is, are you brains a brains?"
Homer,"Ooo, mouth."
Homer,Woo hoo! An unattended tap! Like takin' beer from a baby!
Homer,Helllp me!
Homer,Help me or kill me!
Homer,WHILE TURNING GAY THE OTHER DAY / A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME...
Homer,I'D LIKE TO TRY MOST EVERY GUY / FROM HERE TO TIMBUK-TEE
Homer,"OH, THERE'S SO MANY MEN AROUND THE WORLD, OF EVERY SHAPE AND SIZE / I WANT TO NIBBLE ON JAMAICAN JERKS AND TERIYAKI THIGHS..."
Homer,"I WANT TO FRENCH KISS A FRENCHMAN, AND SPOON AN ENGLISH DUKE / 'CAUSE FRANKLY, DEAR, TO NOT BE QUEER, JUST MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE..."
Homer,SO FIND YOURSELF A MAN WHO'LL WANT YOU IN THE SACK
Homer,I RECOMMEND / OUR DEAR OLD FRIEND / BARTENDER MOE SZYSLAK!
Homer,SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY DO WORSE!
Homer,"Of course I do, Marge. Can you still love a man who's half-beer?"
Homer,To love!
Homer,Or that we made a few adjustments to the soda machine...
Homer,Can't we just all supervise ourselves?
Homer,Woo-hoo! Our boss is our best buddy!
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,"Hey Carl, why aren't you high-fiving?"
Homer,"You see, he hasn't changed!"
Homer,"Hey Carl, look how I messed with the names on the softball sign-up sheet. It's delicious! You know how Smitty's name is Smitty? Well, not anymore -- I changed the ""m"" to a--"
Homer,"...to a ""p"". Spitty... 'cause he spits when he talks."
Homer,"Oh, well... I didn't know that."
Homer,"Why can't I keep the job I have now, whatever it is?"
Homer,"Not an option, big fella. Either you're my assistant, or you find a job elsewhere -- and in this economy, elsewhere ain't hirin'!"
Homer,"Oh fine, I guess I'm at your beck."
Homer,Nooooooo!
Homer,Calendar! Oh my God! I forgot to move Carl's twelve-thirty to two-thirty.
Homer,His astrologist will show up at the same time as his astronomer! This is not good! This is not good!
Homer,"Marge, would you mind if we just cuddle?"
Homer,"Stupid Carl... ""Update the phone list, Homer!"" ""You put my contact lenses in backwards, Homer!"" I'm sorry, honey."
Homer,"Leave me alone, you two!"
Homer,"Honey, I know it's been a rough couple of weeks. But I booked us a night this Saturday, at a very romantic hotel."
Homer,"Ocean view, obstructed."
Homer,"All right, I put in a hundred-hour work week, but I took a power-nap while I was driving us here and now I'm rarin' to go!"
Homer,Lemme try.
Homer,"""LICK... EYES."" Um, I'll try again. ""SPANK... HAIR."" What the? ""WHISPER INTO... ASS."" This game sucks!"
Homer,We're gonna be snore in the morning...
Homer,"Okay. Kiss me, baby! Kiss me like a frog in a fairytale!"
Homer,"I'll make it up to you, Marge, I swear."
Homer,"Actually, those were Carl's shirts."
Homer,"Hey, it's not like I want to go. Go, go, go!"
Homer,"Okay, Fission Week kicks off on Monday with a reception by the International Proton Council. Word is, protons are the new electrons."
Homer,I will! Edamame?
Homer,French Nuclear Commissioner Etienne Ducharme.
Homer,But I have to get back to Marge.
Homer,Bonjour.
Homer,Where I should've been all along...
Homer,In Springfield.
Homer,"Oh I don't think so! You know that woman you've been playing ""hide the baguette"" with? She's the first lady of France, Carla Bruni!"
Homer,"If you fire me, I'll call President Sarkozy and he'll be all over you like Truffaut on Hitchcock."
Homer,You wouldn't dare!
Homer,Oh wouldn't I? Just listen.
Homer,"Allo, you are getting cozy with Sarkozy."
Homer,"Okay, Okay, you win!"
Homer,Hey Ned.
Homer,"Marge, I believe we have a little unfinished business. Come with me!"
Homer,"Now, it's my turn to roll the dice! Wanna kiss them for me?"
Homer,Classic.
Homer,Gotta leave early to beat the traffic. Now to get on route two-oh-five and it's a straight shot home. For crying out--
Homer,"I hate traffic -- the band, and the phenomenon!"
Homer,I can't take it anymore!
Homer,It's daddy's turn!
Homer,Stomp it! Crush it! Kill it!
Homer,"Finally, some peace and quiet."
Homer,Why do my actions have consequences?
Homer,"Now, kids, we're about to get really cold, then really warm."
Homer,Bonk it. Twist it. Smack it.
Homer,What happened?
Homer,Where's the hooch?
Homer,A female that gives birth to alcohol.
Homer,"Well, uh... it's got a rich mash base and a sense of danger. And I detect notes of elderberry, tobacco, oak, no, poison oak... and hints of game."
Homer,Lisa! Lisa!
Homer,"Oh sweetie, I found you! Now, who's gonna find us? Help!"
Homer,"Mmm, not bad."
Homer,"Marge, please. You're embarrassing me in front of the mob."
Homer,Moonshine in the water? I'll be the judge of that.
Homer,Hmm... Hillbilly moonshine -- the little witch is right!
Homer,Start the ride!
Homer,Again!
Homer,Oooh.
Homer,Back to the horses! Back to the horses!
Homer,"Gee Lisa, looks like tomorrow I'll be shoveling ten feet of ""global warming."""
Homer,"I see. So you're saying ""warming"" makes it colder. Well, aren't you the Queen of Crazyland? Everything's the opposite of everything. La-de-da-de-da! I'm Lisa Simpson. La-de-da-de-da."
Homer,"Son, I love you kids. But I'm only going to the hospital one more time in my life and I ain't comin' out."
Homer,"Girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and I don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause I don't know."
Homer,Point and shoot.
Homer,Do I smell tarragon-crusted Atlantic salmon?
Homer,"You had me at ""five-course,"" you lost me at ""romantic,"" and you got me back at ""dinner."""
Homer,And it's not over yet.
Homer,There comes a time in every marriage when it comes down to this. Do we eat dessert or do we make love?
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,We couldn't do both.
Homer,"Hm, people in other countries make love? It's about time."
Homer,"Ooo, look! ""Congress Of The Crow!"""
Homer,"All right, all right, um, your ankle goes there..."
Homer,And turn that upside down...
Homer,...don't look at that...
Homer,"More Vicodin and eggs, please."
Homer,Holy moly!
Homer,"Oh, sweet Meerschaum, take me away."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Well, welcome, Charlie! Nice to meet ya! No glasses -- way to go! This one's a keeper!"
Homer,"I know you miss him, boy. So let's you and me spend some quality father and son time."
Homer,That's so fake. That's so fake. I don't know how they-- Too real!
Homer,"Oh, c'mon! Look out! What would that guy-- Look out! That's funny."
Homer,"Did somebody say ""naked bacon?"""
Homer,"Yeah. It sounded like naked bacon to me. I don't know why they say you're the dumb guy, Tom."
Homer,"No, you said ""naked bacon."""
Homer,Do you guys know Funky Town?
Homer,"Oh, I love going to aquatic parks -- they have worse rides than amusement parks, less fish than aquariums -- but the parking is ample!"
Homer,Now to seal you in for safety.
Homer,"Hurry! If we don't get a seat in the splash zone, I've worn my bathing suit under my clothes for nothing!"
Homer,"Dad, bathing suit!"
Homer,"Oops, no bathing suit."
Homer,Get to the show!
Homer,Wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish in a fresh water aquarium?
Homer,"No, I get my news off the internet."
Homer,It's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... My father is interesting?! The whole world's upside down! That must mean Cathy is funny.
Homer,Nope.
Homer,How come Grampa never shares those stories with us?
Homer,"Marge, my brain is like a computer, and I file away Grampa's stories in a very special place."
Homer,"Hmm, while I'm up there..."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Oh Dad, I got you some scotch. One of those fancy ones the checkout lady had to unlock the cabinet to get."
Homer,"What the?! Well, he's more of a father to me than you've ever been."
Homer,"Stay out of this, Dad!"
Homer,That's it! Here's your ring back.
Homer,It's a father-son commitment band that I bought and never told you about!
Homer,Drop that pillow!
Homer,Stupid Grampa. I try to end the cycle of neglect and he hits me with some super neglect!
Homer,"Marge, how can anyone be mad at himself? It's impossible. Watch."
Homer,"Why you little... oh, I can't. When I look at those beautiful chubby cheeks... c'mere, you."
Homer,I'll kill you! You son-of-a--- Don't look hurt. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Homer,"I'll show Grampa. I'll find my own surrogate father, full of heart-warming stories I can share with the world."
Homer,"Oh, great stuff. And the life lesson is?..."
Homer,"Hmm... I'm just gonna put ""haste makes waste."""
Homer,Isn't that cute? He thinks he's a pack.
Homer,I have a column I'd like to submit. Pay me whenever.
Homer,What? Pulitzer Prize application form?
Homer,"""When I rode with Abe Simpson on the Tinseltown Starliner, I never dreamed his first voyage would be his last? At three o'clock on Monday, Abe passed away peacefully in his sleep."""
Homer,How would he know Grampa was going to die today? Unless... he was going to kill him! But would someone really kill a man just to win a Pulitzer Prize?
Homer,Beware of Marshall Goldmannn!
Homer,A little lower... a little lower...
Homer,How can you stand up to this punishment?
Homer,"Dad, I don't have the right words to say how I really feel about you, but at least I know how to beat up a guy who does."
Homer,Just with indifference.
Homer,Really? Me? You mean it?
Homer,"I've been waiting for this day for so long. The year is nineteen forty-six. In a war-torn world, a single flower blooms. And that flower is an angry Japanese monster named Godzilla. How am I doin', Dad?"
Homer,"Fortunately there was one man who could help: Colonel Tom Parker. The Colonel took this monster, cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name ""The Rolling Stones."" The first concert was a sellout, with many, many, many people eaten. But those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen."
Homer,...and that lasted about five years. But then Godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies. All of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist.
Homer,"Aw c'mon, Marge. There's nothing funnier than a good ol' bonk on the head."
Homer,Not funny.
Homer,"None for me, Marge. I get free donuts at work! I can see them now... in the break room, beside the fridge, the pink cardboard box awaits..."
Homer,"...groaning with a ""United Nations"" of donuts: jellies rubbing elbows with cream-filled, the masculine contours of the box juxtaposed with the feminine curves of the treats themselves..."
Homer,No pink box?! Wha -- what's going on?
Homer,You... can't... do that...
Homer,D'oh!
Homer,They took away our donuts at work! All I've had are my meals!
Homer,I guess these days headhunters can be anything.
Homer,"You nuclear workers have no idea how valuable you are. Times have never been better for your industry, now that all the protesters who marched in front of nuclear power plants are dying off from radiation poisonin'."
Homer,Do you want to come in and get your sister with me?
Homer,"Watch your language! Now, why the hell not?"
Homer,"Oh Bart, you say that now. But when you're grown up, you'll just think it. Now you stay here and I'll get your sister."
Homer,"Man, a lion would not want to see that on his x-ray!"
Homer,"Goodbye, power plant. I'd better get out of here before I have a meltdown."
Homer,You can't win us back with mere donuts.
Homer,That is the most amazing donut I've ever tasted.
Homer,AND YOU LIKE POTATO...
Homer,AND YOU LIKE TOMATO...
Homer,potato!
Homer,TOMATO!
Homer,TOGASAKI-ROTHMAN!
Homer,Songwriters who are stuck!
Homer,"Don't worry, sweetie. With me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to: steal focus from the bride."
Homer,See you at five on the dot. Phone kisses!
Homer,"She's not my girlfriend. She's a girl who I married, who used to be my friend."
Homer,"""Today is your lucky day."" Yeah, pfft!"
Homer,"Hey, any part of a cookie you can't eat is just a waste of time--"
Homer,"Hmm, maybe this is my lucky day."
Homer,"A disc? Please be compact, please be compact! Woo-hoo!"
Homer,Here we go.
Homer,"OOOH, WHAT A LUCKY MAN..."
Homer,"I IS! OOOH, WHAT A LUCKY MAN I IS! BOO-WEEE-BOO-WEEE-WEE-DOO-DOO-DEE-DEE-DOO-DOO"
Homer,"C'mon, line, move! Maybe it'll speed up if I make ""can you believe this"" noises. Oh for goodness sake--"
Homer,"...Yo no creía en fortunas, pero entonces me salió una galleta..."
Homer,"...que decía que hoy era mi día dichoso. Primero no lo creí, pero entonces me caí contra la maquina de dulces, ay, ay, ay!"
Homer,I'm almost there... I can see the church steeple in the distance...
Homer,"Uh-oh, here comes a train."
Homer,"Tickets, please. Hey, where's your ticket? Leave me alone! Why you little..."
Homer,No time to pretend we're friends! Lotto me!
Homer,"One, six, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-four, thirty-five."
Homer,I did it! I'm gonna make it!
Homer,"I'm a-comin', Marge!"
Homer,I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it!
Homer,I didn't make it?
Homer,I'm alive! And surrounded by the...people I love the most in the...
Homer,Could you scooch over a bit?
Homer,I'll try.
Homer,"Barn, thanks for picking up the money for me."
Homer,"Now, what should I buy first? Hitler's baseball? A mirror that gives me advice?"
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,Marge? What are you doing?
Homer,"Here I am a millionaire, and I can't even help the woman who gave birth to me."
Homer,"Oh Barney, that's brilliant! Just for that, you can help yourself to anything from this tree."
Homer,I know. It's where I hide my adult magazines.
Homer,"Catch, boy!"
Homer,Oops -- the Frisbee went into the bushes. Why don't you go find it?
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,A box? No way!
Homer,A new washing machine? No way!
Homer,You go rent us a truck.
Homer,"And now, Marge's secret benefactor is going to get her the luxury she's always dreamed of: a toaster wide enough for bagels. I'll just take out a little money from my ""local branch."""
Homer,Hm. Not as much money as there used to be.
Homer,Why... I'm just...
Homer,"Lenny... and Carl... A fortune cookie... I ran into the candy machine... and I found an Emerson, Lake, and Palmer..."
Homer,"Son, if I was interested in fun, I would've run away the day you were born."
Homer,You're right. I have been acting like Telethon Jerry Lewis when I should've been acting like rest-of-the-year Jerry Lewis. Will you teach me how to put myself first?
Homer,Um... your cut of what?
Homer,Here.
Homer,Wait!
Homer,Do you think you could use someone like me in your band?
Homer,"I said someone like me, I didn't say me."
Homer,"Look at me! I'm flying, like Superman's dog!"
Homer,Race you to the cockpit!
Homer,Sorry boy. You have school tomorrow.
Homer,"With that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!"
Homer,"Boy, I am through spoiling you. First thing tomorrow you're going back to the rotten life you've always enjoyed."
Homer,"Blackmail your father in space, will you?!"
Homer,"Up -- that's my chair, boy."
Homer,"Um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take my chair?"
Homer,I agreed to no such thing!
Homer,Where and what time?
Homer,Never!
Homer,What do I wear?
Homer,Fine. Let me just get my harness pads.
Homer,"Boy, this has gone too far -- I quit! As soon as I finish these oats."
Homer,Not if I tell her first.
Homer,"Okay, I'm taking off the blindfold..."
Homer,Surprised?
Homer,"Marge, soaring above the forgiving beauty of nature, I have something to confess. Um... I wasn't there for that wedding toast because... I was buying a lottery ticket."
Homer,You have a right to be angry. Furious! And even though that ticket won a million dollars and--
Homer,"Uh, yes, well, um... taxes took out a lot... I spent a ton on those things for the family... and um, I didn't know you could rent a balloon..."
Homer,"Yes, but I have one more thing to show you."
Homer,"Marge, those groves of cherry blossoms will bloom every year, to remind the world of the sweetest, most forgiving woman who ever lived... am I off the hook?"
Homer,AND YOU LIKE POTATO...
Homer,AND YOU LIKE TOMATO...
Homer,"Carl, you're a liar, but I love it."
Homer,"Uh, Mr. Burns, couldn't we patch the leak tomorrow? It's date night."
Homer,"I'm sorry I missed dinner, honey. We still have time to catch a movie. That can be romantic."
Homer,It'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.
Homer,"Hey, we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie."
Homer,We're outta here.
Homer,How about bromance?
Homer,Dude...
Homer,This bromance just got interesting.
Homer,Would you like to wear mittens or go commando?
Homer,"What, they come here on Saturday night to clean the ice? Losers."
Homer,"Marge, this is perfect for both of us! It's got bowling for me and sweeping for you!"
Homer,"Let us curl, M'lady. Let us throw and sweep a'twain until the Heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! And afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. And if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of November, we shall proclaim that WE WERE CURLING!"
Homer,Curling is real.
Homer,Great curling reference.
Homer,There's a Winter Olympics?
Homer,"Olympic trials, eh?"
Homer,"Sweep! Sweep! Left, right! Left, right! Back-and-forth!"
Homer,Pack your winter coat! We're going to Canada's warmest city!
Homer,She used to be my therapist.
Homer,How can I ever thank you?
Homer,I couldn't hear the last thing you said! Goodbye forever!
Homer,"OH, A PORK BAO, A SHRIMP BAO, EVERYWHERE A BAO BAO / HOMER SIMPSON WINS A GOLD / SLIDING ROCKS ON ICE... BAO BAO!"
Homer,"Oh my God, I'm holding back the team. But our marriage is based on curling. What am I gonna do?"
Homer,Hm...
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,That's my Marge! High-five!
Homer,It's stuck!
Homer,Can I help you with that?
Homer,"I'll do it myself. When we do things together, they always turn out badly -- for me!"
Homer,"Ooo, you're hot when you're horny..."
Homer,"Ooo, you're mad when you're angry..."
Homer,"Marge, you're really good with your left hand."
Homer,"But this time, on ice!"
Homer,U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
Homer,Oops.
Homer,How's this for a date night?
Homer,"Wonderful, Homie."
Homer,"Yeah, the Simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few..."
Homer,Alcoholics.
Homer,"Listen, Lisa. You're gonna find more than you bargained for. If I were you, I wouldn't dig into the past. I lived in some of that past, and I got out for a reason."
Homer,"I warn you: I don't know what's in there but if it's about a Simpson, you ain't gonna be proud."
Homer,"Me neither. For once, the Simpsons were in management!"
Homer,"Good point, Bart."
Homer,"That's a great story, Lisa! And you should stop reading right there."
Homer,"Well I don't. The motto of the Simpsons is, ""quit while you're ahead."""
Homer,"Time for bed, sweetie."
Homer,"You still reading that thing? I'm warning you: when something goes into that vent, it shouldn't come out. Ever!"
Homer,I got an idea: you can march to Selma -- and tell her she's ugly!
Homer,"The library? Bart, can you believe we're married to those nerds?"
Homer,Leave me alone! I have shares to crop!
Homer,"Listen, Wrinkles! If you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. Or I can make things very uncomfortable for you."
Homer,About Virgil.
Homer,And that's why I earn less than my white co-workers!
Homer,So that's why I love drinking so much.
Homer,"C'est la vie, baby."
Homer,"Credit card offer, overdue bill... credit card offer, overdue bill... huh, what's this?"
Homer,What the... you're a month behind on homework?!
Homer,A little!
Homer,I say this boy needs more homework.
Homer,"I don't have to do it with him, do I?"
Homer,Pile it on! I want him to be Korean by the time he's done.
Homer,"Hm. Clean dishes. I either have to unload them, or, uh..."
Homer,No problem. You can unload.
Homer,Oh my! A child who doesn't enjoy school? Hello? Hollywood?! You want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story? A million dollars? Deal! Now I have to write it.
Homer,Hey! You're supposed to be doing your homework! No more TV for you!
Homer,"Until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair."
Homer,"Too late, Marge. I already used a ""prayer block"" on your prayer."
Homer,"Yeah, right."
Homer,"Hey, why aren't you doing your homework!"
Homer,You don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.
Homer,Well don't be wrong in front of our son!
Homer,Oh yeah? Well .
Homer,No line... near the men's room... I see no reason to question your choice.
Homer,What the?! Then I wanna eat at Moe's Express!
Homer,"That was last week, and you're still bringing it up!"
Homer,Well how could I ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!
Homer,"Fine. I was gonna apologize, but now I'm not going to!"
Homer,I was too! The words were in my brain!
Homer,"No freedom! I have no freedom around this house! After sex, I'm not talking to you!"
Homer,"You can't sex fire me, I sex quit!"
Homer,Must win fight... must win fight...
Homer,Let me say to you all: I'm pretty sure this is not a dream!
Homer,"Oh my God, I killed her!"
Homer,"I've got to apologize. Once again, sleeping at work has saved my marriage!"
Homer,Must apologize. Must apologize.
Homer,We can't let Bart drive us apart. He's the reason we had to get married.
Homer,Bart? Bart who? I'm being cute.
Homer,"Awesome breakfast, Marge! Breakfast in bed is so much better than breakfast in a chair."
Homer,Whatever. Knock yourself out.
Homer,"You may not realize this, Bart, but your mother and I have been fighting about you a lot lately. And I've realized our marriage is more important than your future. From now on, you're on your own."
Homer,"Uh, Marge? I don't want to ruin the moment, but you got something stuck between your-- ohhh..."
Homer,"I love watching you knit. It reminds me of watching pictures download on our old dial-up modem. Remember that day we brought it home and it was all eee, ooo, eee, ooo, onnnggg!"
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"Don't know, don't care."
Homer,I'm saving my yelling for where it does some good. Lisa! You're a wonderful child! Keep up the good work!
Homer,Sorry!
Homer,"But Marge, I thought we were chilling out for the sake of our marriage."
Homer,Fine. I'll do both at once. We should both take a role in vacation planning!
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"Oh, there's a nickel."
Homer,Well I'll be! There's a sofa in here!
Homer,Must... squeeze... harder!
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,And no TV!
Homer,"And when you're out of my sight, you must constantly Twitter me exactly what you're up to, even though I don't know what Twitter is and have no desire to find out."
Homer,"Thanks to our new G.P.S., I'll have you at school in no time."
Homer,Meters?
Homer,Stupid kid. Thinks he's smarter than a computer.
Homer,"Seatbelts, kids!"
Homer,Why you...
Homer,Hey boy.
Homer,Your mother thinks I'm working on the car!
Homer,Talk to Grampa. He used to be a man.
Homer,That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?
Homer,I could kiss you.
Homer,Well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.
Homer,"You're halfway home, lady."
Homer,"No! If you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever."
Homer,"Well, don't worry, boy. I know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls."
Homer,And the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza!
Homer,Look at that.
Homer,I finally caught one of Bart's school plays.
Homer,"Yeah, now that I look closer, that guy couldn't fool anybody."
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"Hey, my bathing suit came off!"
Homer,"Hey, it floats!"
Homer,Hold that thought.
Homer,Here comes the butt!
Homer,"Hmm, let me think... take my family to a war zone... on a bus filled with religious lame-os... in a country with no pork... in a desert with no casinos... ooh, where do I sign up?"
Homer,I can't! Latkes aren't as good as American pancakes.
Homer,They're okay with applesauce.
Homer,A truckload of applesauce!
Homer,"Flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. But the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!"
Homer,After we see the stations of the omelet bar.
Homer,He's going for the record! He's going for the record!
Homer,"Flanders, you're not supposed to help him."
Homer,"Ned, I'm an American tourist. I'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my Carolina Panthers credit card."
Homer,Pan-thers!
Homer,If you say it like Dracula I will.
Homer,"Please, please, please..."
Homer,That is going right on stupidflanders.org.
Homer,"This really means a lot to you, huh?"
Homer,"Boy, are you lousy at reading minds."
Homer,"Okay, okay. For you, I'll try."
Homer,"I'm not, it's my ringtone."
Homer,"Y'ello. This is he. Yeah I wanted to know: do you deliver falafels to the top of Mount Zion? Great. I'd like a large falafel with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese. Yes, I know what a falafel is."
Homer,"Hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. What are you up to?"
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Give my Dad another heart attack?!
Homer,Whuh?
Homer,"I'm sorry. It's just that these tours are so exhausting. You're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing Marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior..."
Homer,Porky Pig?
Homer,"But he is buried here, right?"
Homer,Chickpea Fizz.
Homer,Whatever. It's your camera.
Homer,Your parents made you?
Homer,What? But I thought we'd be neighbors in Heaven. Goofing on all the new dead people...
Homer,"Ned! Ned, wait up!"
Homer,Ned!
Homer,Ned's run off into the desert!
Homer,Ah-ha -- a sand horse! Car of the desert!
Homer,Flanders! Stupid Flanders!
Homer,There's sand in my shoe!
Homer,Good luck surviving without me!
Homer,THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY / AND HUNGRY AND HORNY / BUT MOSTLY JUST THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY...
Homer,Water!
Homer,So salty... Maybe if I... add a little salt...
Homer,"Chosen for what, oh mighty gherkin?"
Homer,"Pickle, carrot, tomato. Pickle, carrot, tomato. Pickle, carrot, tomato."
Homer,"I am more than alive, woman! I am the Chosen One who shall unite all the faiths of the Holy Land! I am... the messiah!"
Homer,Oh yeah. Gotta keep track of those.
Homer,The messiah! Has the passports.
Homer,"I'm more than okay! I am the Messiah, come to save the world! Look upon me and shudder!"
Homer,"As you wish, but look not upon her with lust. And do not send her friendly emails. That's how it begins."
Homer,"The Dome of the Rock? Messiah, away!"
Homer,"This one says ""Carolina Panthers!"""
Homer,Messiah says !
Homer,"Attention Christians, Muslims, and Jews. I have come to gather you into a new faith. From now on you shall be called Chrismujews."
Homer,"Because when you get down to it, aren't all religions the same? They tell you what to eat, when to pray... how this imperfect clay that we call man can mold itself to resemble the divine. But we can never attain that ultimate grace while there is hatred in our hearts for each other."
Homer,Celebrate your commonality. Some of us don't eat pork. Some of us don't eat shellfish. But all of us love chicken!
Homer,Spread the word! Peace and chicken!
Homer,"Well, if I made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in."
Homer,Can I buy you a twelve dollar turkey sandwich?
Homer,How 'bout a Greg Norman Executive Putter from the Sky Mall?
Homer,They have malls on land?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"I say Burns owes us a party. Let's have one, right now, with his wine!"
Homer,I'm pounding Melchizedeks!
Homer,Woo hoo! I'm drinking my salary!
Homer,"Yeah, you're right."
Homer,The government. Taking my hard-earned stolen wine and spending it on that no-good floor.
Homer,"Okay, left hand: Rembrandt!"
Homer,Uh... this is my lunch.
Homer,But--
Homer,Eat my lunch?
Homer,"Okay, I will!"
Homer,You don't think I'm going to?
Homer,Okay.
Homer,There's always a catch.
Homer,Patty and Selma are dead? Woo hoo! A double funeral!
Homer,Please tell me they suffered.
Homer,G-g-g-g-hags!
Homer,"Mr. Smithers, our lives are awesome, thanks to you. And because I know you ""like your loafers light,"" I want to give something back."
Homer,Use that image any way you want.
Homer,Uh listen... can I leave a little early tomorrow? My kid has a thing.
Homer,Smithers. What a marshmallow.
Homer,I don't have a thing with my kid tomorrow!
Homer,"I do, but I'm not going to it."
Homer,Ooh! We mock your very decency.
Homer,"Well, at least we've got the best brand ceiling insulation."
Homer,"Well, at least we've got the best asbestos."
Homer,"I never thought I'd say this, but I wish Mr. Burns was back."
Homer,"Burns, you're coming with us."
Homer,"The war is over and the future won. The past never had a chance, man!"
Homer,No food allowed in bank?
Homer,"Better lie low, my sweet red friend."
Homer,Community service? But... that's work! What about jail?
Homer,No! I wanna go to jail! Free food! Teardrop tattoos! Library books that come to youuu!
Homer,I'll serve anything but the communityyy!
Homer,Just my lunch.
Homer,"Chicken parm, meatball parm, eggplant parm..."
Homer,"Shish ka-parm, angel food parm, moo goo gai parm... my wife can parm anything."
Homer,"Awwww, want a bite?"
Homer,Do you ever wear your police pants to regular things?
Homer,From fast food to fine dining?
Homer,Oh yeah. All the time. They say it's 'cause I'm overweight.
Homer,That's some big underwear.
Homer,Okay. Ever been to Moe's?
Homer,Oh yeah -- sorry I was such a jerk about it.
Homer,"I'm there every day, five to eleven."
Homer,"Oh man, this is so awesome! I can't believe I'm having breakfast where the cops do."
Homer,Aw dang! I lost track of time! I'm gonna be late for work.
Homer,Wow. So this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady.
Homer,Want some sugar?
Homer,Impressive.
Homer,"Hey, would it be okay if I uh... ""ran a make"" on myself?"
Homer,"Drunk and disorderly? That's a little redundant. Hey, uh, mind if I do a little ""spring cleaning?"""
Homer,Really? Me?
Homer,Chief... me too.
Homer,No...
Homer,"Hey, Ralph's a good kid. And he should be, he's got a great Dad."
Homer,"Ooh, ooh! Can I cuff him?!"
Homer,Is he gonna be okay?
Homer,"Don't worry, Sarah. Clancy was there for me. And I'll be there for him."
Homer,Oops.
Homer,"Ahhh, that is so much better than hospital beer."
Homer,"Don't die on me, Clancy. You said our friendship was special. Well if it was so special, wake up you fat sack of..."
Homer,You saved my life. And I came here every day to make sure you pulled through.
Homer,"Clancy, I haven't seen my family in days. Would you mind if I went home now?"
Homer,"Well, if you really want me to stay..."
Homer,Fine! I'll stay a little more.
Homer,Playing nursemaid to Chief Wiggum.
Homer,"Okay, maybe I lied. But you've been so needy... ""I'm hungry,"" ""I'm itchy,"" ""that's not my blood type..."""
Homer,"Hey man, you planted that!"
Homer,"Oh, everything reminds me of Clancy."
Homer,Everything.
Homer,I have an idea. But I must go alone. My car is filled with printer paper I stole from work.
Homer,"Hey, Chief. I uh, brought a thirty-two piece chicken bucket."
Homer,"Well, I was kind of ungrateful. You did save my life."
Homer,"We're not gonna get whacked. Because you're Chief Clancy Wiggum, and you're gonna figure a way out of this."
Homer,"No, faith is what you have in things that don't exist. Your awesomeness is real."
Homer,I know just the guy.
Homer,Flanders! Wake up! Take off your clothes and prepare to be raptured.
Homer,"Now, shave off your moustache and drink the hairs in a cup of cocoa."
Homer,"No, ice cold."
Homer,Look at this electric bill! I'm not made of money! I'm made of man-meat and a skeleton!
Homer,"It's time to unplug these vampire appliances that plunge their prongs into our creamy white outlets to quench their unholy thirst for electrons. Lamp, computer, Jacob's Ladder..."
Homer,How long has this been running?
Homer,Are you calling me fat?
Homer,"Hmm... Alternative Energy Expo. Where there's expos, there's free Frisbees! Let's roll. But we'd better make sure robbers don't know we're out."
Homer,"Now, on to the next funny booth."
Homer,"Yeah, so is getting a real job."
Homer,A churro you can eat in the shower?
Homer,"Well, I'm not usually one to take the word of a Dane... plus, how can I afford it?"
Homer,Months?
Homer,"Hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal."
Homer,I'm starting to regret it already.
Homer,"Yup, I Al-Gored it pretty good. Where's my Grammy for audio book narration?"
Homer,Oh my goodness! It means we're traveling back in time! I can warn President Lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy!
Homer,"Oh, that's just great. I discover electricity and they want to take it from me!"
Homer,"Hello, local utility? You greedy bastards have gouged Homer Simpson for the last time."
Homer,The Simpsons are off the grid! And so far it's going great!
Homer,"Gentlemen, tonight's game is brought to us by something special. The kite's best friend, the flag's partner in patriotism, you've seen cherubs blow it from map corners -- the wind!"
Homer,"Don't worry, I'll go see what's wrong!"
Homer,What the? Who turned off the wind?
Homer,"Oh. Well I'm not crawling back to big electricity! From now on, the Simpsons are living intermittently."
Homer,"The wind may have stopped working, but my brain nev...er does. Check it out, gang."
Homer,But we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting!
Homer,You used to be nicer!
Homer,Now we're cookin' with wind!
Homer,Nothing is ever right for you.
Homer,"Be careful! If you see a downed power line, do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation."
Homer,We'll have to eat Thanksgiving dinner off regular plates like animals!
Homer,All right -- let me get my tool belt.
Homer,"Man, who are these belts made for, French supermodels?"
Homer,"Sure. Lisa, bring the car around."
Homer,Haven't you learned anything from watching Bart drive?
Homer,"Marge, how hard can it be? We're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. It's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a Mexican prison."
Homer,"Ooh, it's dinner time!"
Homer,But that would make a great movie.
Homer,"That whale's not gonna die! We're busting him out of prison, no matter what you say, Escobar! God, this thing writes itself."
Homer,Coming!
Homer,"Okay, we'll need the town's strongest men to roll the whale back in the water."
Homer,Hm. We need a better idea. We'll have to find the town's smartest men.
Homer,"One, two, three, tug!"
Homer,It was my idea to put the whale in the water.
Homer,"Don't worry, honey. Right now she's lying on God's beach."
Homer,"Oh Lisa, I'm sorry. I tried my best. I know it's really hard when you discover your dad isn't perfect."
Homer,"I'm trying to be a sensitive father, you unwanted moron! Lisa, where were we?"
Homer,Of course.
Homer,It kills me to see her like that. And if there's one thing I can't stand it's being killed.
Homer,"Now, Lisa, I know you miss your whale. So I got you a pet that will never die. An invisible dog."
Homer,"Aw, look. He's doing his business."
Homer,"Hey! Not on the rug! You bad dog! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop biting my leg! Ow! Alright, that's it! You're going outside!"
Homer,Bad dog! Stop!
Homer,Why couldn't I be eaten by a giraffe? That would be fun!
Homer,Nature is a toothless dying hag! We are gonna save those whale babies!
Homer,I'm taking it on a test drive from the boat store! Get in!
Homer,Shark week just got cancelled.
Homer,Oh come on! Leave me alone! I'm trying to save your precious whales!
Homer,You like sharks?
Homer,Typical eco-jerks -- using words to talk!
Homer,"Sharks, innocent? Please. Every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things. The shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing: the crime of murder..."
Homer,"Ooh, a baby whale. My diet is working."
Homer,"Ooh, maybe the blood will scare the sharks off!"
Homer,"Thanks, buddy!"
Homer,"Hey, I'd do anything for a sweet intelligent mammal, by which I mean you."
Homer,"Absolutely. He's young, he's got two cute kids... he'll be moving in with a sexy lady octopus in no time. They'll have to sell their old place... too many memories. But if I'm not mistaken, there's a little whale-a-puss on the way."
Homer,I want some of that!
Homer,Guess what company had a giveaway at Moe's last night?
Homer,Keep guessing...
Homer,"What's it say, boy?"
Homer,Mmmm. Good mac and cheese.
Homer,I'll have to check it out sometime.
Homer,Mmm.
Homer,I am pretty full.
Homer,I'm on my way!
Homer,Golf ball-sized hail!
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,/
Homer,All right! All right!
Homer,I'm goin' home. It's not safe in here.
Homer,"Hey boy, whatcha doing?"
Homer,My little Einstein.
Homer,"A phony bird call?! That means Marge is coming! Everyone, act legal!"
Homer,"Well, uh... The one place the cameras can't see is right here in our backyard so I'm charging people to do whatever they want -- isn't that wonderful?"
Homer,"Remember how you wanted me to get that expensive operation? Well, now I can afford a motorcycle!"
Homer,Who wants feet steak?
Homer,"Oh no! I don't have to listen to you. If I'm not on camera, you can't see me!"
Homer,"Everyone in this town is sick and tired of you looking over their shoulder. ""Don't leave your sprinklers on in the rain!"" ""Don't burn that pile of ventriloquist dummies!"""
Homer,Later. Later.
Homer,"You see, Ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil."
Homer,"God created the devil? Finally, He did something cool."
Homer,"Well, if you ask me, you were trying to play God."
Homer,You can help me take out those cameras.
Homer,Moe's leaving town?!
Homer,"I like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach."
Homer,Cleaning the gutters?
Homer,Cartoons! Everybody be quiet!
Homer,"So, Marge, what were we talking about?"
Homer,"Sorry, honey. I wasn't listening. And I won't be listening now."
Homer,"Son, I'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and I can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything."
Homer,"I hear what you're saying, Lisa -- nothing."
Homer,"Into the playpen, sweetie. And if you get hungry, there's lobster!"
Homer,It's from Moe!
Homer,Moe is running off with one of our wives?!
Homer,I got Marge!
Homer,Marge! Are you running off with Moe?!
Homer,You're losing me? Or you're leaving me?!
Homer,Aw dammit!
Homer,Can't talk! Must text!
Homer,"Marge, have u left me 4..."
Homer,"Well, Marge and I don't have any problems. We never even fight anymore."
Homer,What?
Homer,"Moe, my in-laws are coming. I need something strong enough that I forget I hate them, but not so strong that I tell them I love them."
Homer,"Marge, this is crazy!"
Homer,Flanders?!
Homer,All right.
Homer,What the--
Homer,Why you--
Homer,Lousy--
Homer,You take that back!
Homer,"Go ugly up someone else's house, you penis-curling she-devils!"
Homer,I'm doomed.
Homer,Uh... I do.
Homer,"I was there when your wife got to Moe's, being my usual effervescent self..."
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,"Yeah, Padre. How innocuous are your flashbacks?"
Homer,The ferry will be back in ten minutes. It'll take us home... to find out the truth.
Homer,"Today's the first, which means it was last month, which means you're being ridiculous."
Homer,"Otto, you got to get us back to town!"
Homer,She's packing her bag!
Homer,Thirty-nine.
Homer,Marge! No! Stop packing your--
Homer,Painting supplies?!
Homer,You're not leaving me?
Homer,"Oh Marge, you not leaving with Moe is the best thing that never happened to me."
Homer,"Moe, I don't know whether to punch you or kiss you... so I'm gonna do both."
Homer,Why should I? The city's broke! They can't afford to enforce their precious laws!
Homer,Cookies... so delicious... must buy house.
Homer,Marge... get loan pre-approved... offer over asking... waive inspections... two-day escrow!
Homer,...initial the radon disclosure... and done.
Homer,"But my loan has already been sold in pieces to banks, hedge funds, and municipalities across the globe!"
Homer,"Man, you're good with the tools when you want to be."
Homer,"Or Frasier on ""Frasier."""
Homer,"Stupid kid, fooled by a silhouette."
Homer,Ice cream!
Homer,Nothing is ever boobs or ice cream.
Homer,"Marge, the bathroom scale is lying again."
Homer,"All right, Sideshow. I'm gonna do to you what you shoulda done to my son a long time ago!"
Homer,It's like you're a Chinese empress!
Homer,And I'm not a locksmith!
Homer,"Man, that dude does not like Bart."
Homer,Mexico! Andalé! Andalé! Arriba!
Homer,"Help us! Help us, for the love of God! Won't somebody help us?!"
Homer,"Uh yes, I'd like... um... how do you say taco in Mexican?"
Homer,"Yes, that's exactly the word I want to translate."
Homer,"Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Uh, just give me one of those crispy shells with meat in it."
Homer,Stop! Stop! Stop!
Homer,That is disgusting.
Homer,Hmmmm. Not ugly enough. I want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this.
Homer,Oh my God.
Homer,"You never fail to nauseate me, boy."
Homer,"I wanted to, but your mother said kids might tease you."
Homer,"Half an hour to show time, your ugliness."
Homer,"But if we win this, we get a gift certificate."
Homer,It doesn't matter.
Homer,You can't close! I'll have to go home and drink better beer at half the price in natural lighting!
Homer,"Oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his beautiful--"
Homer,Yeah. Now what am I supposed to do?
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Well, since Moe's is closed again, I thought I'd help you cook dinner."
Homer,What are we watching?
Homer,After the title page it's Bob Dole's memoirs.
Homer,"Now that I have all this free time, I thought I would do you a huge favor."
Homer,I organized the kitchen. I labeled everything with a label maker...
Homer,And I also mixed all the spices together into one super spice!
Homer,Uh-oh. What kind of ventilating is that?
Homer,"Wow, Marge. I can't believe you're taking me to a sports bar."
Homer,Watchin' hockey! Watchin' 'em pass that puck! Oh yeah!
Homer,"Uh, the Long Island Ice Teas?"
Homer,"Well, that place was for diehard sports fans, not guys like me who are only fans when their team makes the playoffs. So, I decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny I left in my pants went."
Homer,"Ah, those guys are all crooks. They charge you for parts and labor? Pick one, buddy! I can do this just fine by myself."
Homer,"Don't worry, I got it!"
Homer,Marge! You ruined my shot!
Homer,That was awesome. I feel like the Tiger Woods of sex.
Homer,It's four AM -- you kids should've been in bed a half hour ago!
Homer,"Oooh, the Nobies!"
Homer,Lucky.
Homer,I would kill for that.
Homer,Arctic Circle! I just got that!
Homer,How easy am I?
Homer,Can my son come too? He knows what to do when I swallow my tongue.
Homer,They fight and bite? I never go to Europe without learning something.
Homer,Another good one...
Homer,Did you say a Hague?
Homer,Wait! Not so fast! We found something to save Krusty.
Homer,"Uh, what region is America?"
Homer,Woo hoo! We're Region One! We're Region One!
Homer,No fair! We just went to church!
Homer,Fifty bucks each?! That's your life savings?!
Homer,HIS STRIKE ZONE'S THE SIZE / OF A TUNA FISH CAN...
Homer,"Five hundred dollars? That's, like, ten dead Grampas! Some of us stuck to our limit, Marge. And I would've loved to rent this carpet cleaner another day!"
Homer,"Well, it's a cat -- I'm not sure it's the cat."
Homer,"You know what, honey? Just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town."
Homer,"After Bart, that bag's the best mistake we ever made."
Homer,"Come on, Marge -- let's hit the buffet."
Homer,"Oh, you don't want to wait for that buffet -- Wiggum's making his move!"
Homer,"Sure, sure!"
Homer,Let me just grab one more shrimp.
Homer,I believe this stranger!
Homer,Check and mate.
Homer,"Wait a minute, Marge. Don't you realize what just happened?"
Homer,"You got to enjoy that bag for nothing! We can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund."
Homer,"Hide a sandwich in this hat. ""Mary Poppins"" myself to work with this umbrella."
Homer,"Yeah, the luck lasts longer! Thanks to the power of returns, this store is our closet!"
Homer,Come in. Come in. Don't wipe your feet.
Homer,I wish. What the hell are you doing?!
Homer,"Now, everyone onto the hot tub."
Homer,"Come on on, the cardboard's fine."
Homer,"Good afternoon. I'd like to return this merchandise. Wrong size, wrong color, not as pictured, and other reason please explain."
Homer,Yes... uh... maybe I'll just come back during someone else's shift... Is Claire working today? She's a real sucker.
Homer,How do you know my name?
Homer,"It's not what you think... I came here to warn them... yes, to warn them about, um..."
Homer,Yes! I mean no! I mean... You'll never get me!
Homer,"I have to sign a release so you can broadcast this, right?"
Homer,"Initial there, and... Never!"
Homer,Can you tell me when this is gonna be on? I'm thinking of having a party.
Homer,"Hello, Flanders. Don't you have a neighbor on the other side?"
Homer,"Sorry, Marge. The last time I stepped on a baseball field, I got tased."
Homer,"That's a problem for future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy."
Homer,"Hey pal, howya doin'?"
Homer,"Hey, let's hold hands and skip inside!"
Homer,Woo hoo! Underpants dinner!
Homer,I'll put a stop to this nonsense!
Homer,"Sorry Marge, I gotta call bullcrap on that. The '69 Mets will live on forever, but you think anyone cares about Ron Swoboda's wife and kids? Not me -- and, I assume, not Ron Swoboda!"
Homer,"Boys don't have feelings, they have muscles."
Homer,"They sound good in my brain, then my tongue makes not the words sound very good, formally."
Homer,...Then Pete Rose plowed into his friend Ray Fosse...
Homer,...dislocating Fosse's shoulder in a meaningless game...
Homer,"...He had earned the nickname ""Charlie Hustle..."""
Homer,"If he makes it, that's my son!"
Homer,You stink!
Homer,"Oh man, I'm never comin' down."
Homer,Woo hoo! Another ladder!
Homer,"Ridin' high! Sinkin' low! Top of the heap! Down I go! On top for good! Oh, cruel hubris!"
Homer,"Man, it's been a crazy morning. Champagne?"
Homer,"Yeah, charts are for squares, baby."
Homer,That's my cell phone.
Homer,"What is it? Lenny, I'm on a second honeymoon. You'll have to pick your own lotto numbers. Now, where were we?"
Homer,Oh baby. Let's give those seagulls something to squawk about.
Homer,"Oh yeah baby, I like it when you're distracted."
Homer,"Fine, I'll get the hook."
Homer,"Don't fight it... That's it... That's it, a little more... How's that?"
Homer,"You're safe now, my friend."
Homer,"O-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know..."
Homer,Fine. I'm going for a walk.
Homer,"Hey, I've had a hard trip too. One of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses."
Homer,"Marge, can I have a word with you in private?"
Homer,I don't trust that guy. I bet he killed everyone on that boat himself.
Homer,Why do pie makers get all the girls?
Homer,It was poisoned.
Homer,"Well, it was rhubarb."
Homer,Berry-peach?! That's my favorite!
Homer,"Well, we'd better do it quick. Because he's making scones!"
Homer,"They should call this one ""recipe for murder."""
Homer,Never mind.
Homer,"Ooh, got a text."
Homer,"Yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea."
Homer,Come 'n' get it barnacles!
Homer,This proves nothing. Roger could've been the one that killed them!
Homer,Then... his story was true!
Homer,"Hey pal, how ya been?"
Homer,The pie you baked us killed that shark!
Homer,"We had to kill him, or he'd tell people we tried to kill him."
Homer,Looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death.
Homer,"Oh, come on! Just a second..."
Homer,Bankers away!
Homer,I repeat: no one will ever know.
Homer,"Marge, what are you doing? That pie is poisoned!"
Homer,She just wanted to ride bikes through New England. But those seats hurt my ass!
Homer,Ever wonder what she thinks about?
Homer,"I know, I know. Don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows Frankenstein. It's racist somehow."
Homer,I get the drumstick!
Homer,"Okay, okay. If a mosquito bites you, does it become a vampire too?"
Homer,"Okay, okay. If you bite your tongue, does it become a vampire?"
Homer,"Man, you vamps got it made... you sleep all day..."
Homer,"Boy, this place has every kind of vampire there is."
Homer,Excuse me?
Homer,Have you seen these kids?
Homer,Super-Team -- fly!
Homer,Hyah! Hyah!
Homer,"Back off, you unholy dreamboat!"
Homer,Pretty ironic -- a cross being used to kill someone.
Homer,"Whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?"
Homer,"Well, nobody loves his kids more than me!"
Homer,Come and get it.
Homer,And not the good kind!
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,Yes! I can fly! See you back at the house!
Homer,Nooooo!
Homer,"Maggie, you can't climb into the TV. If you could, I'd make Alex Trebek answer some questions."
Homer,"No child of mine will go without anything, ever! Except quality healthcare!"
Homer,"Nice part of town you got here. Too bad you keep it so far away. Now that we're best friends, can I get the baby elf?"
Homer,You can't tell what's inside! Of all the times not to have x-ray vision.
Homer,I'll take... that one.
Homer,"Aw, this isn't the right one -- she wants the baby!"
Homer,You're lucky you're behind glass.
Homer,"Sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!"
Homer,Drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... I'll show 'em -- I'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Oh I'm sorry, Maggie, but even at your age, I'm sure you understand things can't always go your way, and that's why... I can't believe we didn't get that stupid elf!"
Homer,The march of progress.
Homer,Be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.
Homer,Just don't dress me up like a woman.
Homer,"Tell her ""no deal""."
Homer,"What is troubling you, my son? I mean, my girl son?"
Homer,"Hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. Sooner or later, everyone meets their ""Homer."""
Homer,"It may not be a boy. It could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the Santa Fe lifestyle. Just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die."
Homer,"Oh, that's probably because to her, the saxophone is a me, and she doesn't want to end up like you. G'night."
Homer,"No, she does, totally, but uh... with a happier ending. Goodnight!"
Homer,"Nothing, sweetie, nothing! Here, let me explain."
Homer,She does not want to... turn out like... you... didn't... not until... diplomatic... trapped... help... remember nothing!
Homer,"Well, if you check your purse I think you'll find... the seven of clubs!"
Homer,"I am so sorry, Marge."
Homer,Ta-da!
Homer,That would be one weird-looking kid.
Homer,"Oh, I've seen that look before. That's the ""I ate the piece of wedding cake she's been saving in the freezer ten years"" look."
Homer,Run!
Homer,"Thank you, four-eyes!"
Homer,What time Monday?
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,All right!
Homer,"Your mom's doing laundry, but she authorized me to say goodnight for her. So, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you sweet dreams."
Homer,Look what Maggie got!
Homer,"Up, a father has his secrets."
Homer,"Hurry up, boy. We have to burn everything the cat touched before the virus makes us paranoid."
Homer,All right. We'll get the vaccine.
Homer,I thought he was an old clump of rags.
Homer,Why did Burns make us all come here?
Homer,Hell yeah!
Homer,Or helping a railroad worker grip his sledgehammer!
Homer,"Oh man, this is great. The most evil man in town is in our power. He will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. And anything else my limited imagination can come up with."
Homer,"Marge, it's the golden rule: treat others the way they mess with you."
Homer,"Now boy, everyone in town gets Burns for half an hour to do as they will."
Homer,Amen.
Homer,"Okay, Burnsie, follow the carrot!"
Homer,"Don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end."
Homer,Where's the other girder?
Homer,Already?
Homer,"Yeah, I've done all I can do in that medium."
Homer,You're welcome!
Homer,"And so The Bloody Hangman, his hair sticky with blood, skittered along the cobblestones, gunk dripping from his one good eye, singing his evil land chantey."
Homer,"KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / I'M AFTER YOU / WITH MY BLOODY NOOSE / STRONG ENOUGH TO HANG TEN MOOSE / KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / IT'S JUST A STORY, BUT IT'S REALLY TRUE!"
Homer,"No, I'm no-ot! Yes I am. The Bloody Hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of London..."
Homer,"Did I? Anyway, the Bloody Hangman set to his gory work. Bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs."
Homer,Possibly!
Homer,The Hangman's here!
Homer,"Ker-shaw, ker-shew, my lies have come true!"
Homer,"All finished, boy."
Homer,Flimsy? This gentle pat says different.
Homer,"Is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken I played, lost to, and ate at the State Fair?"
Homer,Way ahead of you.
Homer,You can race pigeons?
Homer,"Hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty..."
Homer,Danica Patrick in my thoughts!
Homer,Ended that a little too soon.
Homer,What they don't suspect is that I'm into this.
Homer,Stupid dog! Let go of that delicious bird!
Homer,"Come on out, birdie! Follow the sound of my voice-voice-voice."
Homer,"Dearly beloved. I'd like to open this service with the words of Emily Dickinson: ""Hope is the thing with feathers..."""
Homer,Stupid dog!
Homer,"Marge, listen to the man -- he pays Bart's salary."
Homer,Why can't you support my gibberish? I'd do it if you were stupid!
Homer,A shrink who takes kids and pets?
Homer,Even my tramp stamp?
Homer,I got the idea from a show where people regret these.
Homer,Oh baby! Well whaddaya know! Oh come on!
Homer,"Nicely done, boy."
Homer,"Oh, that's pretty sure. Subscription rate, right?"
Homer,"Hmm... Back yard, back yard, toilet, ocean, don't know, back yard, Flanders' mailbox, Lenny's freezer, tire fire."
Homer,Enough chitchat. Time for operation dog dump.
Homer,It was still too much.
Homer,"I'm sure you will, because you take such good care of your ostriches."
Homer,Maybe we should get going.
Homer,"Marge, I'm watching a rerun of an important Bowl game."
Homer,I mailed them the answer but they never printed it.
Homer,"Ooo, unknown caller!"
Homer,Hey!
Homer,"All right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt."
Homer,You said nobody gets hurt. Those were your exact words!
Homer,"Well, Bart learned a lesson, and most important of all, we don't have to stop and pick up dinner."
Homer,Maggie.
Homer,"Hey, show some respect. Three gingerbread workmen died making that."
Homer,"I'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go."
Homer,You're gonna be okay.
Homer,It's almost over.
Homer,Now to take care of the witnesses.
Homer,I'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
Homer,"Kids, remember when I promised to feed us from that victory garden? Well, instead I grew this tree!"
Homer,You don't want a Christmas tree? That's crazy! Next you won't want a Christmas ham.
Homer,"Sweetie, if your mother was in trouble, they'd tell us as soon as they could."
Homer,"Marge is Mia? Oh my God, she changed her name?"
Homer,Why couldn't it have been me?
Homer,Shut up.
Homer,Whose turn is it to cry?
Homer,Look at that picture!
Homer,"Someday TV will be invented, and it will be free. Then it will cost money."
Homer,"Now remember, pack only necessities."
Homer,Now we just have to make it.
Homer,YOU'LL BE OH SO PLEASED / WHEN THE O.J. IS FRESHLY-SQUEEZED / AND TOAST IS MADE FROM HOMEMADE
Homer,WE'RE GONNA GO OUT FOR BREAKFAST / WE'LL GO OUT TO EAT / IT'LL BE ANY PLACE YOU CHOOSE / AS LONG AS IT'S RUN BY JEWS / 'CAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THIS HOLIDAY'S SO GREAT.
Homer,"ALOHA'OE / ALOHA'OE... Hurry up, kids! We gotta get to the airport!"
Homer,Now nothing stands between us and sunny Hawa...
Homer,Ai-yi-yi-yi!
Homer,I got the week off by telling Mr. Burns I had a neck injury!
Homer,"Mr. Burns, why'd you come to see me?"
Homer,Uh... uh...
Homer,Coming!
Homer,"Fine, I'll come clean."
Homer,"No, it's not. I just told a lie so we could go to Hawaii."
Homer,Sh!
Homer,"C'mon, jus' one more drink, Marge."
Homer,"Sweetie, relax. Let's just watch some TV."
Homer,Huh? What'd I do?
Homer,Fifty bucks?! That used to cover two public nudities and a poop in the park!
Homer,What the hell?!
Homer,"C'mon, Lou. Gimme a break!"
Homer,Since when is all this against the law?
Homer,This is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it's ruined.
Homer,"Oh, I get it. The government runs out of money, so they pass a bunch of lame-o laws to sock it to the little guy."
Homer,That's almost a thousand dollars!
Homer,Ten minutes? I can't wait that long! I left an ice cream cone in my cup holder!
Homer,"Chief, this is just a big misunderstanding. I meant to write ""bride."" It's a wedding present."
Homer,My bribe!
Homer,"It's okay, it's okay. I can be out in eighteen months with good behavior."
Homer,Don't tell me I'm not capable of good behavior!
Homer,"Your honor, I would like to request a sidebar."
Homer,"All that time I'll be stuck in my cell, unable to exercise..."
Homer,I repeat: unable to exercise...
Homer,What? This guy?
Homer,I can't go undercover with Fat Tony. He's met me. I've been in his house. I was briefly his Consiglieri... Consugly... Canolli... Robert Duvall.
Homer,Can I be Johnny Undercover?
Homer,"Okay, Melvin Mafia."
Homer,Can I keep the name after I'm done?
Homer,Ayyyy! Ohhhh! Ayyyy! Ohhhh!
Homer,Fuhgetaboutit!
Homer,"Uh, what's my name again?"
Homer,"Okay, I'm comin'."
Homer,"I'd like a third helping, please."
Homer,Just get the ladle down there deep -- that's where the beaks are!
Homer,"Hey, you're that guy from the F.B.--"
Homer,There was barbecue sauce on it.
Homer,But I haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.
Homer,What's a dime store?
Homer,Blue pants power!
Homer,Beating? What beating?
Homer,Oh. That beating.
Homer,Can I have any of the steaks?
Homer,That's so mean!
Homer,Please! Let me have it! Come on! Give it to me right in the mouth!
Homer,Well... back in my keister you go.
Homer,How're you gonna do that?
Homer,I'll take care of this.
Homer,"Oregano, basil, rosemary..."
Homer,"Sorry, boss."
Homer,Yeah. Those guys are probably FBI informants.
Homer,Oh yeah. I got in your gang and you barely know who I am.
Homer,What are we doing here?
Homer,"Well, I guess I could tell him he could improve his phone etiquette."
Homer,Oh no! No! I... was uh... just thinking how cheap this crime would have been in the seventies when gas was thirty-five cents a gallon.
Homer,This is horrible! I keep smelling my own breath!
Homer,My neck is kind of itchy.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!"
Homer,Don't ask questions! Just go!
Homer,Ayyyy!
Homer,Ayyyy!
Homer,Ohhhh!
Homer,Ayyyy.
Homer,Ohhhh.
Homer,No! You're wrong! Check again!
Homer,"So that's it! You used me to kill a man, and all I get is a handshake and a blanket?"
Homer,Poor Tony. He didn't deserve this. He was just a soldier in a war he started.
Homer,"It's not over, Marge. It'll never be over. When I shut my eyes, all I see is Fat Tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach."
Homer,"Oh. Well, uh... you wouldn't like it. It's not very good."
Homer,"No, no, I oversold it."
Homer,I'd give anything to bring you back.
Homer,Fat Tony?
Homer,"Wow, I've never seen a mobster use a tracksuit for exercising."
Homer,I understand. I loved him too.
Homer,"Do what you gotta do. The quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there."
Homer,I worked for Fat Tony. And he was the best boss I ever had.
Homer,"Wha-- oh, oh, uh, Mr. Burns? Uh, you were cool too."
Homer,He took me to a fight that he fixed. But he never let on. Not even when I bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. Then he said he would dope a horse for me.
Homer,Are you gonna kill me now? 'Cause I'm super ready.
Homer,"Wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! What kind of a world is this?"
Homer,And your enemies closer?
Homer,Fit Tony took his cousin's place running the Springfield mob.
Homer,"The pressures got to him so he started to eat. Soon, he was known as ""Fit Fat Tony,"" then just ""Fat Tony"" for short."
Homer,"And me? Now, I'm just an average shnook like everyone else."
Homer,Stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family. And the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby.
Homer,"And I have to admit, it's a pretty good life."
Homer,Can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.
Homer,Are you through with the chair? I've got to do the taxes.
Homer,"Okay let's see, number of dependents: three. Um, add to line thirteen..."
Homer,"Hm, better check last year's return."
Homer,Hm.
Homer,"Been a while since our wives got together, huh?"
Homer,"Ooh, I got a text!"
Homer,Are you gonna open it?
Homer,Because you're my best friend in the room.
Homer,Anyone see a good beer commercial lately?
Homer,"Sure, I'll stay home and Skype with the guys at Moe's."
Homer,Stupid Flanders' wi-fi!
Homer,"Ion. Hmm... No. ""Irene Ryan is TV's Granny."""
Homer,This is late for Marge. I assume. I've never been home at this hour.
Homer,"Hey, Marge. Partaking of the grape, were we?"
Homer,Great. That's great. But I have to get to work in the morning.
Homer,"It's kind of weird, us all being naked in here."
Homer,Right... neither am I.
Homer,"Ooh, three!"
Homer,"Well, I've put it off, but today I'm finally getting this garage organized--"
Homer,Guess I'll put these tools away. Put 'em on hooks and stuff.
Homer,Can we at least drink beer or something?
Homer,"Oh, you beautiful man."
Homer,God you're hilarious.
Homer,I don't like those guys.
Homer,Oh no. I left a candy bar in my desk.
Homer,Time to punch in.
Homer,A dinosaur!
Homer,Huh?
Homer,He's washing his hands.
Homer,Wait a minute! Your standard markup is four hundred percent?
Homer,"Check out my tolerance, Marge. I'm going to use the men's room."
Homer,"Hey, I didn't know you were... uh... you know, one of those--"
Homer,But you do like comic books.
Homer,Ah! Got one!
Homer,Everyone in that live studio audience is dead now.
Homer,"Lisa, mash the buttons till something good comes on."
Homer,Life was so much easier when a machine told you when to laugh.
Homer,"I liked the producing, the executive producing and especially the co-producing. But the supervising producing was the best I've ever seen."
Homer,"Bart, son, if I bought you that bike, you wouldn't appreciate it."
Homer,"Because when you get anything you want, you don't want anything you get."
Homer,Someday you'll understand that I'm just being a good dad.
Homer,Why you little!!!
Homer,Hm. I never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid.
Homer,"Son, I won't strangle you anymore, but I also won't get you that mini-bike."
Homer,"Wish I could, son. I really wish I could."
Homer,Bart's mad because he wanted me to buy him something but I didn't think it was the right thing to do.
Homer,"Marge, not in front of the refrigerator."
Homer,"Well in that case, Lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so I opened the drapes to let in more sun."
Homer,"Well, in season two, when Sam got good grades, he got a very surprising reward."
Homer,"And if you do it, son, you'll get the same."
Homer,That's great.
Homer,"Son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work."
Homer,"Well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends."
Homer,"Hmm, if this were a TV show that would be a helluva act break."
Homer,"But it could use a button. Oh, what if I said... Well if you..."
Homer,You still see that crow on shows sometimes.
Homer,"Hey, Apu."
Homer,Can't lose that. It's the best picture of me I have.
Homer,"Yeah, I do know a lot about nuclears."
Homer,"Marge, would you like a ""Thicker Than Waters"" collectible plate?"
Homer,Oh yeah? I'll show you.
Homer,"""TV Guide Offer, One World Trade Center..."""
Homer,Awww...
Homer,"And I love having you here, son. 'Cause you can wake me up if somebody comes."
Homer,"Check this out, Bart. One of those retinal scan dealies. It only opens to my eye or an exact copy."
Homer,Let's see if this works.
Homer,"Damn, that hurt!"
Homer,I'll just use my eye.
Homer,Because you've been such a great kid lately and I wanted to show you I appreciated it.
Homer,"Hmm, the boy's acting really weird. I did everything that TV show told me to and he's still not happy."
Homer,Where is he going?
Homer,Why on earth would a child go to the zoo...?
Homer,Step away from the traitor!
Homer,The boy's flash drive may be in there. But I've got a lifetime of nuclear secrets up here.
Homer,I know what you're saying! I understand food talk in every language!
Homer,Um... I'll see myself out.
Homer,"Okay, who can take me to the airport for less than twenty dollars? I can stand here all day."
Homer,My feet hurt.
Homer,"Well, now it's time for the best kind of bonding -- sitting next to each other in silence, staring blankly at the TV."
Homer,"CHERISH THAT FAMILY SMILE / PICKET FENCE DAYS GO SOMETHING SOMETHING / THE FUTURE IS COMING SOON / MOM AND DAD AND KIDS ARE SOMMMMETHING That's my favorite song now. Sorry ""Don't Fear the Reaper."" Everybody! Air guitar! Come on, do it with me! Use your whammy bar! Whew! Now fuzz it up! Excellent!"
Homer,"Now all you need are customers. Well, better get home to the little woman."
Homer,Do you have plans for tonight?
Homer,"Oh, thank you, prior obligation!"
Homer,Drive my kids to school?! Never!
Homer,Stupid double snuggler's hitch! Only hope is to chew off my leg.
Homer,"Ow! Ow! Huh, mmm, not bad. Just a hundred and twenty-seven more hours."
Homer,"Oh Marge, don't worry, a lot of movie stars have gray hair, like all those women we loved in the eighties."
Homer,"Well, it's not easy with you talking all the time."
Homer,So... chicken.
Homer,"Sweetie, you've always been beautiful, but now you're my silver belle. Let me get the camera we use for precious moments and insurance claims."
Homer,What has she done?! I feel like I'm married to Richard Gere!
Homer,"I can't talk now, I'm talking to myself! No, no, Homer, go ahead. Thanks, Homer, it'll just be a minute. What's up?"
Homer,"So basically, my job is to make you look good by comparison. Like West Virginia does for Virginia."
Homer,The good doctor has just the prescription.
Homer,You ever notice that pizzas have gotten so small lately?
Homer,"Yes, that's exactly it!"
Homer,Oh I know.
Homer,"So Lenny, ever get that rebar out of your head?"
Homer,"Well, I don't know... it's a lot of work."
Homer,Deal!
Homer,I do keep it together.
Homer,Uh-oh. Usually when it gets this quiet Mr. Burns is standing behind me.
Homer,Marge? What are you doing here? This bar is for singles and wingmen only.
Homer,"Marge, Marge, put down that broom. You've got nothing to be afraid of from them. I'm a wingman. Part of a great tradition including Val Kilmer from ""Top Gun,"" Wedge Antilles from ""Star Wars,"" and me, from now. And you know why I'm a great wingman? Because I have the confidence that comes from knowing I get to go home to you."
Homer,And you know what else this whole experience has taught me?
Homer,Probably.
Homer,"Well, I guess I do have a ""type."""
Homer,"Is my job creating power, empowering?"
Homer,Only my hairdresser knows for sure.
Homer,He's dying in a retirement home. Now kiss me.
Homer,Wait! I haven't chosen my mix-in!
Homer,Okay... I'll take some of... that.
Homer,Mix it in.
Homer,"That's it, boy! I'm eating your yogurt!"
Homer,He didn't know that!
Homer,Stupid kid. All you do is cost me money. Money I could be wasting!
Homer,"Wealthy? Hey, remember the guy who drove you to school that one time. Eh?"
Homer,"So, what brings you here, Mr. Chair?"
Homer,"I legally forced him to say ""semi""."
Homer,My little Roman Polanski!
Homer,What?! What's wrong with being Roman Polanski?
Homer,He what?...
Homer,You monster!
Homer,Observe.
Homer,Soda?
Homer,More for me.
Homer,It would be an honor!
Homer,"There's something going on at the nuclear plant that's a little more important that your ""table read."""
Homer,"""Family, today I graduate from my anger management class."""
Homer,Pained noises.
Homer,"Oh okay, uh, Lenny, hit me with that chair."
Homer,"Don't feel bad, boy. Everyone makes mistakes. Yours is just public and expensive."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,I have many people to thank...
Homer,"Angry Dad's voice is part Walter Matthau... Hey, Felix!... part Little Richard Whoooo! ...and a little bit of Snoopy when he cries."
Homer,I'd like to thank Mr. Speedy Pants Repair for sewing up my pants just before the ceremony...and the woman who has inspired me everyday for the past twenty-five years... the cute one from the Bangles. See you at the cool party!
Homer,Hey! Don't you know it's awards season? Who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?
Homer,"If I find out it's a right number, you're in big trouble."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Oscars? What are you talking about? My son gave me this list of awesome things to do in L.A.
Homer,Hmm... Who could possibly want to stop me from accepting an award?
Homer,"I was born a Rollin' Eighty, and I'll die a Rollin' Eighty."
Homer,"You got your wish, boy. I'm proud of ya. I'm sorry I took all the credit."
Homer,"Hey, they're like five bucks on eBay."
Homer,"Oh, hi! Ricky Gervais, umm such an honor to meet you, Sir Ridley. I love your movies. Or as I call them, ""films."" Umm, glad I bumped into you, actually. Because, uh, I'm looking to expand beyond comedy. I know what you're thinking, Sir Ridley. You're thinking ""Oh my word, he's been making me laugh all these years, but now he's moving me as well. I'm gonna have to put him in my new film. What do you think?"
Homer,I'm a seat filler.
Homer,Well why couldn't you have said that a minute ago? Don't take any of my ideas.
Homer,"Me! Me! I want him every night, and forever and ever! 'Cause I love my--"
Homer,"That's great, honey. If you were a boy, you'd be a scientist."
Homer,"Hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains!"
Homer,It does!
Homer,And there's something else it might be good for.
Homer,Why are you guys eating so fast?
Homer,"Uh, you look tense. Let's discuss this over a cup of Grampa's coffee."
Homer,Your kisses feel like raw liver.
Homer,"Come on, come on, make with the laffy juice! I wanna take Grampa to have his bellybutton pierced."
Homer,"Oh, because Lisa won't tell me what flower it's from."
Homer,Yeah. But Lisa won't tell me how to make it.
Homer,Nerd.
Homer,Huh? This one didn't make me feel anything.
Homer,"Thank you for the tour of your factory, Mister Wonka."
Homer,Go ahead.
Homer,That's what I was gonna call it!
Homer,"Oh yeah -- we better ""grump it up."""
Homer,Your grandfather is not a monster.
Homer,"Now, let's chain him in the basement until the circus gets to town."
Homer,It better be tonsillitis.
Homer,"So, I guess we're all in the same boat, huh?"
Homer,"Walther, let's not be so hasty. Who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? Besides, our generation's got everything under control! Now, if you'll excuse me, I was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. To Moe's!"
Homer,Flat tire? No problem!
Homer,"Great idea, but I don't have any money."
Homer,And I wouldn't have to pay it back for three more years! What are the odds of that much time happening?
Homer,Problem solved. Generation awesome does it again!
Homer,"Their ""can-do"" will bail out our ""won't-try"" every time!"
Homer,Cheech and Chong are coming back to Springfield?
Homer,"Bart, Cheech and Chong were the Beavis and Butthead of their day!"
Homer,I've failed as a parent. I swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. To the media room!
Homer,He's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!
Homer,Back then we'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops. Which was about three times.
Homer,Hide the dope!
Homer,Then what did I just smoke?
Homer,I thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!
Homer,"Ooo, he's gonna say ""Dave's not here!"""
Homer,Dave's not here! Dave's not here!
Homer,Oh no! Chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.
Homer,I can't do reefer comedy -- I'm drunk. Two different animals.
Homer,"Dave's not here, man!"
Homer,Dave?
Homer,"Dave's not here, man!"
Homer,I'll give Dave your message.
Homer,My time being wasted was not wasted!
Homer,Yes! Will I get to meet Dave?
Homer,How 'bout Don Johnson?
Homer,It is so cool for you to let me go on tour with Cheech.
Homer,"Sweetie, don't worry. I'm gonna come back so horny and angry..."
Homer,I can't believe I'm riding around in Cheech's van! The van made of weed!
Homer,Oh. What's it made of? Hash? Shrooms? Lysergic acid diethylamide?
Homer,"Don't worry, Cheech. I know all the classic bits of you and Chong."
Homer,Can we get high from the fumes?
Homer,CHEECH AND CHONG HAS LOST ITS CHONG / I AM THE CHONG NOW... TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT ME-E...
Homer,"Oh yeah, I getcha -- ""work on the show."" Maybe we should start at four-twenty, right? Marijuana reference!"
Homer,Hard work? I thought this was gonna be fun.
Homer,CHEECH IS SURE A LOT LESS COOL / THAN I IMAGINED...
Homer,BETTER SHUT UP / CHEECH IS REALLY MAD / I WISH THAT I HAD GONE WITH CHO-ONG...
Homer,"Oh yeah, a reward from Cheech!"
Homer,Hmm?
Homer,What the?!
Homer,Why aren't you exactly like your stage persona?
Homer,Eurocentric! When do we have wacky adventures?
Homer,Can we at least get some French fries?
Homer,Stop speaking Spanish!
Homer,It's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from Cheech and Chunk.
Homer,"Yes, sir."
Homer,Tour bus parked. Gotta save Marge!
Homer,"Marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" Well, sometimes people can be too."
Homer,"Don't look back, Marge. Don't look back."
Homer,Let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. We've got something more important to attend to.
Homer,We'll deal with all that later.
Homer,"C'mon, if Art Garfunkle could forgive that untalented twerp Paul Simon, you can do this."
Homer,Tell him how you feel.
Homer,"Come on, surrender to the moment! Don't make the mistake I always do of thinking too much before you act!"
Homer,"Hold on, lemme get the door here."
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,"Oh, okay, wait, let's start again."
Homer,"I'll be out here with you, Dave."
Homer,Yes?
Homer,Okay. I'll go get some stuff.
Homer,Way down here?
Homer,Okay!
Homer,All right!
Homer,"Gee, sorry, Dave."
Homer,Hey! Mr. Burns needs our help!
Homer,"Looks like it's up to me. Let's see, target at two o'clock... adjust for wind ..."
Homer,But I haven't finished my rituals yet!
Homer,All your money and all your stuff.
Homer,"Uh, Super Bowl tickets?... playoff tickets?... regular season, bobble-head day?"
Homer,"Well, this has been great. We should get home soon -- the game's going to be starting."
Homer,"Oh, that's right! I hope you kids are enjoying yourselves today, because you and your children will be paying for this place long after the team moves to another city."
Homer,"EVERYBODY DANCE NOW! DO, DO, DO, DO / DO, DO, DO, DO..."
Homer,"Come on, party pooper -- bust a move!"
Homer,"Aw, come on, sourpuss. Tickle tickle!"
Homer,Tickle tickle too!
Homer,Tickle-tickle-who-wants-a-pickle!
Homer,"Marge, he's laughing, that means he's happy. Has the Joker taught you nothing?"
Homer,"Son, I'm really, really sorry."
Homer,"Oh, I don't know if I can... whoo!... ever make it up to you. I-- whoo!... but I sincerely whoo!"
Homer,No one else is doing it. I'm trying to start it. Whoo!
Homer,Whoo!
Homer,Bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.
Homer,"Well, it was your idea to give him self-esteem in the first place!"
Homer,Now I have to work overtime--
Homer,--just to counteract the self-confidence--
Homer,"Well of course, I would love to be a more sensitive father. You know that."
Homer,I'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.
Homer,"Please, Marge, no! The other negligent dads'll make fun of me! They're so cliquey!"
Homer,I miss my friends from drunk driving school. They were so cool.
Homer,"Well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. But, oh, you know, the other day, Bart, the little dickens, said I had an elephant butt. So anyway, I'm strangling him, and I said to Bart..."
Homer,"Yeah, strangling. I mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! Right? Anyway, I said ""Bart""..."
Homer,I guess it's just how I was raised.
Homer,"So... are those butter cookies for everybody, or..."
Homer,Who do you have next period?
Homer,"Hey, Doc. Where is everybody?"
Homer,Why didn't you tell me not to come?
Homer,Wha-wha-what are you doing?
Homer,"No Doc, please! I'm just a little boy!"
Homer,"Dr. Zander, you made me see my life through Bart's neck, and I swear, I will never, ever strangle my boy again."
Homer,"Um, I uh, lied about having health insurance."
Homer,"Hello, boy."
Homer,I want you to know I'm cured.
Homer,"Oh son, I can't quit drinking any more than I could quit being a man."
Homer,Now it feels like morning. What I am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.
Homer,Go ahead -- just try to provoke me.
Homer,"Oh come on, bust your daddy's chops."
Homer,Why you little...?!
Homer,I'll teach you to...
Homer,Why you... I'm gonna... Maybe this time...
Homer,Can't hurt the boy. Can't hurt the boy.
Homer,What the?!
Homer,"Boy, get down from there!"
Homer,All right.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"Oh c'mon, now you're a tree?"
Homer,"How many more, sir?"
Homer,These are my keys.
Homer,"I-I said my keys-ter is ready for a whooping, sir."
Homer,"No, no. I'm just a kid. Leave me alone!"
Homer,"It's ""A-B-C-1-2-3""! It's the easiest song in the world!"
Homer,What?!
Homer,"Oh, that's ridiculous. How could two people from the same family need therapy?"
Homer,Then what do we win?
Homer,I dunno. There's something about this noose I just don't like.
Homer,I don't know...
Homer,Y'see? You see how that boy pushes your buttons?
Homer,"Son, you and I are gonna be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist."
Homer,"Pretty sweet, eh boy?"
Homer,"Not bad, not bad. Marge, how much do they pay us for doing this?"
Homer,"What the? First we work, then I pay, then I have to eat fruit? Why was I ever born?"
Homer,"Honey... on a non-stone fruit-related topic, I booked us a couples massage."
Homer,"When we get home, the peaches will be gone."
Homer,"Masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything."
Homer,My ear makes money?
Homer,"Hello, boat store? I'd like to order a boat. What do you mean, dial tone?"
Homer,Let's see what else you've been hiding in there.
Homer,I want my pot of gold!
Homer,I forgot why I'm doing this.
Homer,"Lisa, don't feel bad. Judas betrayed Jesus but he still got paid."
Homer,I can't stand to see one of my female children unhappy. I'm gonna go pound some sense into that ring-linking rabbit-yanker!
Homer,"Hey, let me down! This is gonna leave a diamond pattern on my skin!"
Homer,"Okay, maybe secrets are a big deal, but my daughter's a good kid. So why don't you act your age, forgive her and let me down."
Homer,"I'll save you, Lisa!"
Homer,The real magic is raising three kids in this economy! You can put the ball back now.
Homer,"And, here you go. ""Do not give your coat to--"" Dammit!"
Homer,"I was standing in this line to use the bathroom, but now my license is expired."
Homer,Hmm...
Homer,Boy that's good.
Homer,Woo hoo! First in line! Brought you a gift bag.
Homer,And we've got front row seats!
Homer,"Well, well, well, if it isn't ""before"" and ""after."" Blob and Blob Lite. Tweedle Yuck and Tweedle Blecch."
Homer,Fat Tony! I was just complimenting your beautiful girlfriend... while insulting her hideous twin.
Homer,Oh my God!
Homer,You are cruel but fair.
Homer,I'm trying. I swear I'm trying.
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,"Yes! I'm so happy I lived to see this day! He did give her the kiss of death, right?"
Homer,I decorated her car for nothing.
Homer,Lousy Saint Louis Cardinals. Can't win the nineteen eighty-five World Series on Classic Sports.
Homer,"Fat Tony! Are you gonna cut my head off and leave it in a manger scene at Christmas? And then an old Italian nun finds it. And she's all... No, no, no, oh, no, no! He's too beautiful to die! Ohhhh!"
Homer,"Hm. So, should I bring a towel?"
Homer,"Um, I take a special size."
Homer,"Come on, Bart. We've been out here for hours."
Homer,Maybe we've found all the truffles. The only thing I've dug up was these weird-looking mushrooms.
Homer,I'll dispose of those for you.
Homer,"Yeah, that's his thing. Anyway, Fat Tony and I think this is a chance to patch things up between you and Selma. Plus it's a free weekend at the beach."
Homer,Selma? Va-va-va-wha?!
Homer,"Well, if you insist."
Homer,You are such a gentle kisser.
Homer,HEY!
Homer,Wouldn't they be girls?
Homer,You know -- it had that painting of that lady and the monster on the ceiling.
Homer,He's cheating on Selma? That's crazy! Why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home?
Homer,I'll just sit here quietly.
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,How could Tony cheat on me so soon?
Homer,"Y'know Selma, from what I've seen here, Fat Tony has a lot of bad influences on him. I walked though a door last night and they were playing cards for real money."
Homer,"Aw, can't we stay one more day? The Occurrence and I are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled."
Homer,"I don't wanna be ""that guy,"" but Marge is making me be ""that guy."""
Homer,"That's a wife ring? Marge, don't look!"
Homer,"You were right, Marge. These people are not for us."
Homer,Which is lucky for me because you're always right.
Homer,"I get to enjoy this, but I'm not responsible."
Homer,"Actually, Dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too."
Homer,"What do I do? Patty's gonna kill me! Unless... I kill her first! I put the body in the car, I dump the car in the lake, I put a James Taylor CD in the stereo so they think it's a suicide..."
Homer,"Fine, whatever."
Homer,I'll just keep cutting till I hit something solid.
Homer,"And now, to break the news as gently as I know how."
Homer,Wake-up-and-look-at-your-hair!
Homer,What happened to you?
Homer,Who undid my do?
Homer,That's just what I was going for! I was going for Scary.
Homer,You did this?! With your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!
Homer,And stay out!
Homer,"Lady, I'm not a hairdresser -- I just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans."
Homer,"A hundred dollars?! Marge, how much is that in smackaroos?"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Well, I open a lot of crazy things when I'm drunk, but I don't think so."
Homer,"Just call me ""Homer Fingerhands."""
Homer,"Marge, when someone loses their hair, they miss it the most. It's like a beloved dog that died on your head."
Homer,"Now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, I dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe I should open a hair salon."
Homer,Yeah. But what if I can't find any commercial rental property?
Homer,"Oh now, how could someone as young as you know about twenty years ago?"
Homer,"I'm sorry, honey. All day long I have to listen to women talk."
Homer,Not a good time.
Homer,"Oh yeah. Men are such dogs, and vice versa."
Homer,Is there anyone in here that just wants a haircut with no chitchat?
Homer,Oh?!
Homer,These are really good scissors.
Homer,"All day long they tell me stupid, pointless, boring stories, and I have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face."
Homer,When I look at you -- all I see are the foibles that drive your women crazy! Foibles! Foibles! FOIBLES!
Homer,"Sorry Sarah, I'm retired."
Homer,I'd like to see you try.
Homer,Excuse me.
Homer,Come on! Would you--
Homer,"C'mon, bro, don't hassle me!"
Homer,"Stop that. Okay, okay. You win. I'll teach you how to make love to your wife!"
Homer,Right.
Homer,"I can't. They won't let me. Lenny, be a pal and saw off my hands."
Homer,Suck! Of course!
Homer,"Oh my God. Like Mozart and Johnny Knoxville, my genius cannot be stopped!"
Homer,There's only one way out -- I'm committing Barbicide!
Homer,Why doesn't anything kill me?
Homer,"Marge, do you hear it? Listen! It's the hair -- growing! Always growing! Blonde, brunette... auburn!"
Homer,I'm afraid it's all too true. My wife has betrayed me... with another hairdresser!
Homer,Another hairdresser?
Homer,"Aw sweetie, thanks for saving me from the horrible life Warren Beatty lived in ""Shampoo."" And now it's time to pay you back..."
Homer,As long as it doesn't involve losing weight or changing my pants.
Homer,"I love your low prices, but why did these weddings get cancelled?"
Homer,Awww...
Homer,And these keys are from all my jobs.
Homer,"Cake, will you do me the honor of making my stomach the happiest bag of acid in the world? You will?!"
Homer,Time for a shortcut.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Fine.
Homer,"Uh-oh, they've got the right-of-way."
Homer,Morning.
Homer,Who's alone in the vehicle?
Homer,"Uh, first the good news... two of your kids are not locked in the car."
Homer,Maggie!
Homer,"Well, if you live long enough you start to accumulate things. This is from a gas station men's room. They put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it. These are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was--"
Homer,"Stop who, Marge? Be specific."
Homer,"Well, it might have been the time when..."
Homer,No.
Homer,Or maybe I just found them on the ground.
Homer,Oh my God... there's the fire brewer... the beechwood ager... the rat filter...
Homer,"The Duff blimp! Oh, how I'd love to drive that thing."
Homer,"Really, Duff blimp? You really want me to?"
Homer,"Oh, what the hell? Life is made to be lived. I've been buttoned down too long!"
Homer,When we see each other again you'll be an old man and I'll be a baby!
Homer,Hm. Is it drinking and driving if you're flying a blimp? Maybe I can find the answer by texting.
Homer,"Yo, Lenny... ...do you know anything about... flying the blimp while drinking..."
Homer,What was that?
Homer,"So long, suckers!"
Homer,"Hey, kids!"
Homer,If I tossed you guys a bucket full of something could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up? Don't drink it!
Homer,But there's so many buttons!
Homer,"Bart, take the controls!"
Homer,Blimp Assassin Three.
Homer,Xbox.
Homer,"Fly the blimp, you spoiled kid!"
Homer,"I'll save you, honey!"
Homer,Boy! Stomp on my head!
Homer,You're a real jerrrk!
Homer,Why you undead little...!
Homer,"That doesn't mean you're any better than him, young lady. He could be a war hero."
Homer,All pooted out.
Homer,It's worse than you think. I have to buy you a new anniversary present.
Homer,Little help...
Homer,But you learned! You grew!
Homer,I thought I was.
Homer,Awww...
Homer,"Little help... little help... Flanders, little help?"
Homer,"Oh, absolutely, Ned. Sorry."
Homer,Little help...
Homer,"Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy will put Jack back in the box."
Homer,"Okay, time to go back in the... night-night... This is harder than it looks... don't you humiliate me in front of my kid... I thought we had a deal, man!"
Homer,"Well, if it isn't the local school marm... and his new girlfriend. That's a burn on you, Flanders."
Homer,"Whoa! Flanders, this chick does not get our thing!"
Homer,"Yeah, language."
Homer,"Marge, tell her how I don't push Ned around."
Homer,"Hey Ned, can I borrow some hair?"
Homer,"Don't panic, son. We can bust up Teachy and Preachy. Here's what we do: I'll take Flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. You scare Rod and Todd by telling them Krabappel will become their evil stepmother."
Homer,Just the opposite of real life.
Homer,"Yeah, isn't this place great? If you're single you can come here every night."
Homer,"Ned, let's cut to the chase."
Homer,"Ned, if it's boneheaded to talk you outta seein' Edna, then I don't wanna be brainheaded."
Homer,"Oh Ned, I never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude."
Homer,"Oh, you beautiful, beautiful wuss."
Homer,"Ned, I have a confession to make: I may not have come here solely with the noble intention of getting drunk. But now, from the bottom of my heart, I wish you and Edna the best."
Homer,Fellow barflies! To Ned Flanders and Edna Krabappel!
Homer,Shut up.
Homer,"Guys, quit telling the truth!"
Homer,"Um... uh... So uh, Joey, is Wikipedia accurate when it says ""Walk This Way"" was inspired by ""Young Frankenstein?"""
Homer,"Don't you mean ""neighboreeno?"""
Homer,"You stupid jerks! I can't believe you could be so cruel! Especially you, Joey Kramer!"
Homer,"I've got some bad news for you, Marge. I'm actually not."
Homer,"Wha? My doctor said ""don't walk."""
Homer,"Flanders, hold up!"
Homer,"I know, I know you're not comfortable with all the guys Edna's seen around town."
Homer,"Ned, I've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! Endless, endless forgiving!"
Homer,"And didn't the Easter bunny himself say ""forgive them, father, for finding all my eggs?"" And if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and Edna can find a way to make it work."
Homer,"There's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name."
Homer,Right. Teasing.
Homer,I'm waitin' for ya.
Homer,"Also, if you wanna find the real shooter of Mr. Burns, go back and look for more clues. They're all there!"
Homer,"Yeah, right. A baby shot a guy."
Homer,QUIET STEPS ARE WHAT I TAKE / SNEAKING IN AT NOON...
Homer,JUST IN TIME FOR MY LUNCH BREAK / GOT MY FORK AND SPOON
Homer,"TIME THE CAMERAS JUST RIGHT,"
Homer,DUCK IN THE BATHROOM.
Homer,"I'M STILL DRUNK FROM LAST NIGHT, / GOT DRIVEN HOME, I DON'T KNOW BY WHOM."
Homer,"SOME MAY SAY / I DON'T DESERVE ANY PAY, BUT HEY / I CAME UP WITH ""SIXTIES DAY"""
Homer,LAST MAY!
Homer,"While I'm here, I might as well pre-punch out..."
Homer,"Hm, we've had a lot of bills lately. Better put in some overtime."
Homer,"Larry, my man!"
Homer,"Hey, you're not Larry. How come you're not Larry?"
Homer,"Uh, listen, if you could indulge me... Larry and I fist-bump every morning. Like that..."
Homer,The warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence.
Homer,Wha?!
Homer,Sheez!
Homer,"Maybe I was a little hard on him, expecting him to be Larry right away. By the way, where is Larry?"
Homer,Good ol' Larry.
Homer,"Say... Wayne, I couldn't help but notice that your breath doesn't smell like alcohol. You want to go grab a beer after work?"
Homer,"Well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping."
Homer,"As God as my witness, this fist will be bumped."
Homer,"No, a guy at work seems not to like me. I guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay."
Homer,"I love you so much! Potatoes and gravy on the side, please."
Homer,"Charlie, wanna grab a beer?"
Homer,Oh. Okay.
Homer,Wayne!
Homer,Want a ride?
Homer,"You know, I just got a little chill when you said my name."
Homer,"Look, I'm not weird or anything, I just like to feel like I'm friends with everybody."
Homer,But what if the weathergirl--
Homer,Men's room? Oh my god! We're completing each other's...
Homer,Completing each other's... sen... ten... cesss...
Homer,Wayne?
Homer,"Wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but I think you're awesome."
Homer,"Oh c'mon, stay for dessert!"
Homer,Sure. Why not.
Homer,It's best to concentrate on what you do have.
Homer,"Wayne, stop! That's Mr. Burns."
Homer,Why don't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet?
Homer,"Of course. I mean, how long could it be?"
Homer,"That's funny, because I have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future."
Homer,That robot took our jobs!
Homer,He said it.
Homer,Or maybe it was him.
Homer,"Man, this robot really gets me."
Homer,"Your voice is so gravelly, just like Lauren Bacall's."
Homer,"Neh, they couldn't find a Google map photo without me naked or urinating."
Homer,"Not the one you're thinking of, there's another one."
Homer,WASHIN' OUT THE DOG POO / SURE BEATS PICKIN' IT UP / FLANDERS' DRIVEWAY IS MY GOAL...
Homer,"Oh, he's gone. I don't know where he went."
Homer,He has no friends.
Homer,Except me!
Homer,"Well, I suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured..."
Homer,Hey! Wha?! Wha?! Wha?!
Homer,"No, not the middle seat!"
Homer,Death to America!
Homer,Fine. I am being held somewhere in the Springfield area. Turn the card.
Homer,What will you guys use when there aren't newspapers anymore?
Homer,"Oh, well way to make me feel obsolete."
Homer,"Oh look, here's a coupon for scissors that you have to cut out. Think, geniuses."
Homer,"Hey, hey! What are you doing?"
Homer,This is no way to treat the talent!
Homer,Cold. So cold.
Homer,So cold. Warm me up.
Homer,Just let me put my hands under your armpits.
Homer,So much violence on the surface world. I'm going back.
Homer,Cold. So cold.
Homer,"Aww, that's what I call closure!"
Homer,They always come up with such catchy ways to make us pay for things we don't need for kids we didn't want.
Homer,I don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.
Homer,Don't buy it! I bought one last year and it was crap construction!
Homer,Paddles down! It's the only way to change the system!
Homer,"Why of course! Even if I don't have a legal obligation to pay, it's clearly the right thing to do."
Homer,"Here's one thousand dollars... two thousand dollars... three thousand dollars... Ooh, I need more cash. Better go to my invisible ATM."
Homer,What? Two dollar charge for non-network bank?!
Homer,"Bart, I wanna ask you about something I read in a magazine. Are you boys cyberbullying each other?"
Homer,"Marge, I parented!"
Homer,"Later, losers."
Homer,"Bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse."
Homer,"Marge, my ice cream's melting and I haven't finished my brownie!"
Homer,You guys need to get a woman.
Homer,Are you covering me up?!
Homer,"The least I can get out of this whole nightmare is some face time on the local news. It's kind of my way of sending a Christmas card. Happy Holidays, everyone! Family's fine!"
Homer,I'm fine.
Homer,Okay... I'm on the floor... I can't move... so far a normal Sunday morning.
Homer,This is so horrible -- I can't speak...
Homer,"How did this happen? Last thing I remember, I was decorating the house for Halloween."
Homer,"Ah, Halloween. The one time of year when the squalor of our home works to our advantage."
Homer,Where's that spider?
Homer,"Squeeze, squeeze... squeeze, squeeze. A real spider would get so mad if I did this! I wonder if this thing has batteries."
Homer,It's alive?!
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Ow!
Homer,"Well, at least I still look good."
Homer,"Oh, Marge. This is the purest love there is: patient, supportive... ooh, cleavage!"
Homer,Oh my God! She's still on the first sentence! Must make her stop... how to express my...
Homer,"I guess my life isn't so bad. With the help of my loving family, I even published my first book...and I've finally reached a state of serenity and-- another spider!"
Homer,"Oh man, what's this bite gonna do? My wrists are tingling... I feel new powers surging within me..."
Homer,"...I want you to find out what's making that funny noise in Homer Simpson's car. It's, uhhh, you know, it's like a chigga-chigga-chigga-chigga. But you only hear it when you're driving over thirty. And you never hear it when you take it to the shop."
Homer,"You forgot Patty and Selma. Oh, wait. That hasn't happened yet."
Homer,"Now, how would that work?"
Homer,"Okay, Stupid Flanders, first I want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor who gave Homer Simpson a cone that had a little air in it."
Homer,Come on! God does crazy things! Check your Old Testament.
Homer,"Hey Bart... I mean, Jesus. Hey son, you want Flanders to kill anybody? He's totally in my power."
Homer,And I sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!
Homer,"Yeah, and what are you gonna do about it?"
Homer,Language.
Homer,Why you little!... /
Homer,"""In the event of a primary core breach, you have fifteen seconds to avoid a complete--"
Homer,A woman of stature!
Homer,"Assistant? Well, I have been pretty overworked lately."
Homer,But I guess I should find out a little bit about you.
Homer,So your dad has money to lend?
Homer,This is where we get our coffee. Just leave a little at the bottom so someone else has to make the next pot. The burning smell will let them know.
Homer,"Uh-oh, it's Old man Burns!"
Homer,"Hello, Young man Burns."
Homer,That sucker soaks up flattery like a Twinkie soaks up gravy.
Homer,Oh well!
Homer,"Thy will be done, Lord Vader. Please don't hurt me. Please."
Homer,Awww...
Homer,"Marge, get my seal club! The big one!"
Homer,Life imitates Flart.
Homer,Hm.
Homer,Why would a Homer Humiliator do this to me?
Homer,"Y'ello. Hey, Barney... a free movie screening? Of course I can go! I just need somebody to hold down the fort."
Homer,"Oh, uh, Roz, I have to step out for one hour and forty-three minutes. Could you cover for me?"
Homer,"Woo hoo! Oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!"
Homer,I thought of it first.
Homer,"Marge, I just saw the greatest movie. Guess what happens when a mop is replaced with an octopus! I'll give you a clue, it's funny!"
Homer,Someone snitched? Wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me?
Homer,Up or down?
Homer,Don't tell my wife.
Homer,"I'm telling you guys, Roz told Old Man Burns I ditched work early and now I'm her assistant."
Homer,What the-- This is a gentleman's club!
Homer,This is terrible. What am I gonna do?
Homer,"Can't, Marge. I'm fighting for my professional life here."
Homer,"Do you know what I just learned? My job is the reason I get those checks every week! And now that I'm demoted, the checks have gotten smaller! Not in physical size, but--"
Homer,Am I early?
Homer,"Since I got demoted I have to show my I.D., but the picture was taken so long ago I put on a lot of weight, so I have to stretch out my face and say ""I used to look like this..."""
Homer,You're mean!
Homer,Can one of the hundred be making the list?
Homer,Can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones?
Homer,"Do this, do that. Lousy Roz, thinks she's so big..."
Homer,Hey.
Homer,"I'm having problems with my new boss Roz. She's the most evil person to come out of Ohio since LeBron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason."
Homer,Is this her?
Homer,C'mon. The apple must be wreaking havoc with the Twinkie!
Homer,"Are you aware that ""stones"" means ""man junk?"""
Homer,"That's it! That's it! My nightmare is over! Oh Flanders, you are my personal savior!"
Homer,Hail Flanders! Mightier than Jesus!
Homer,"Congratulations, Roz."
Homer,"Uh, I just came to say that you're perfect. So perfect, I think Mr. Burns should give you a hug."
Homer,"I won't say, but his initials are S.F."
Homer,Hug! Hug! Hug!
Homer,I don't know what that middle word means.
Homer,What is perception?
Homer,No.
Homer,Little help?
Homer,Need more butter! And not the unsalted.
Homer,"This Saturday, from the Dad who brought you ""cemetery paintball"" and ""go-karts on real roads,"" comes the greatest activity yet..."
Homer,And check these out...
Homer,Is there any better feeling than cutting in line because a plastic badge says you're special?
Homer,"Wow, video games sure have changed since I was a kid. How many points does it take to get an extra life these days, son? Thirty thousand? Certainly not fifty."
Homer,I won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.
Homer,"Man, how many quarters does this game take?"
Homer,"And we're in Hall D. Three halls, three minutes..."
Homer,No problem.
Homer,Out of my way! / Move it! / Geeks must yield to normals!
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,I need a nap!
Homer,Yeah I was on today. Scary on.
Homer,"Look, honey, a family's like a team. And on every team you have the slam-dunking megastar and... the referee."
Homer,"Okay, okay, how about this: next week, you take the kids on a Saturday Surprise Dad Day."
Homer,"That's good, Marge -- get all the terrible ideas out of your system."
Homer,Here's what I do: pick the thing that Marge would hate the most...
Homer,"Marge, the kids are acting ethnic!"
Homer,"Oh no, I don't eat anything new unless I've eaten it before!"
Homer,"I don't want to think about food, I want to like it. Why drive across town to ""savor"" a bowl of mystery mush when there's four different Krustyburgers we can see from our house?"
Homer,"Oh, and here's my favorite restaurant: ""la fridge!"" It's open twenty-four hours a day and there's no dress code!"
Homer,"All right, food nerds, reality check..."
Homer,"All the food in those pictures is poop by now. Minds blown, you're welcome."
Homer,I'll remind you kids what real fun is!
Homer,And I've got tickets for the grand opening Saturday night!
Homer,"Pine needle... sorbet... Pine needle sorbet!! My kids do not eat sorbet, they eat sherbet, and they pronounce it ""sherbert"" and they wish it was ice cream!"
Homer,"Fine. Blow off ""Fun Dad,"" go eat your walrus mustaches and deep-fried pixie wangs."
Homer,Jealous? Me?! That is to laugh! The very idea... if anything you're the one who's jealous!
Homer,Of how much fun I am to be around! It's always a party with Fun Dad!
Homer,Too sad to walk! Too sad and fun to walk...
Homer,"When I'm sad, I make baseball bats."
Homer,Really? You'd let me in on your thing? Even though I think it's stupid?
Homer,"Hand me that saw, Marge!"
Homer,"When I'm happy, I make birdhouses!"
Homer,Kids! Guess what? Mom invited me to your fancy dinner!
Homer,I guess Fun Dad is a foodie now!
Homer,Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!
Homer,Fun Dad is a foodie now!
Homer,This is my thing and always will be!
Homer,Fun me... fun me... fun me...
Homer,"You know, I'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner. Maybe I'll like it."
Homer,"Well, actually, I've come around on hipsters. Takes a lot of guts to all wear the same hat."
Homer,"So it's weird -- don't worry, I'll make it fun."
Homer,"East Oak Street, is that it?"
Homer,Here it is: 1501 East Oak. No name on the door -- very trendy.
Homer,Is this the chemical kitchen place where you do the crazy cooking?
Homer,The experience begins!
Homer,Just like Marge said -- chemicals and test tubes. The open kitchen is a nice touch.
Homer,"I guess I'll get started before my family gets here. How much for a taste, you know, just to get me going?"
Homer,"Ouch, this place is fancy."
Homer,Hipsters... Too cool for school...
Homer,"Well, my wife thinks it's too crazy for me, but I'm gonna prove her wrong."
Homer,I'm doing this for my family!
Homer,This better be dinner theater!
Homer,Marge! This isn't a food restaurant! It's a meth restaurant! A meth-taurant!
Homer,Sorry!
Homer,Now that's my kind of foam.
Homer,"Here's fifty bucks. For the next two hours, I don't want to know you exist."
Homer,Family fun day.
Homer,Ex-tinct!
Homer,"We're not here for you, we're here for Lenny."
Homer,"Yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?"
Homer,"All right, you can each have one toy."
Homer,"All right, that's it! Forget it! No toys for anyone!"
Homer,Okay -- Maggie gets a toy!
Homer,I've waited my whole life to hear that!
Homer,So tired... go on without me.
Homer,It's not against the law to sleep in a Tyrannosaurus head!
Homer,I demand to speak to my paleontologist!
Homer,A million bucks?
Homer,I know five idiots!
Homer,"The perfect crime, eh?"
Homer,A million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.
Homer,We're taking down kids who read.
Homer,I'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write.
Homer,Tween-lit gang-write. But this Babar needs a Zephyr.
Homer,You're the Zephyr.
Homer,It won't be like Kansas City.
Homer,"Come on beautiful, I can't do the job without you, so what do you say?"
Homer,The caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.
Homer,Do you have a computer?
Homer,You're in.
Homer,"Relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in Shelbyville."
Homer,"Wait, you're gonna be all the guys? How would that work?"
Homer,"Okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!"
Homer,The king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?
Homer,But why?
Homer,"I just hope we put in enough steampunk, whatever that is."
Homer,The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy.
Homer,"Yeah, only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript."
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,"We know, we wrote it."
Homer,"Stupid, stupid, stupid! We forgot to create a fake author!"
Homer,Or... your name could be on a book in ten minutes.
Homer,No.
Homer,"Gentlemen! To ""The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy!"""
Homer,"So, does this square us for Kansas City?"
Homer,"How could the publishers change our book? If they had been in charge of the Sistine Chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope's private naked dude mural!"
Homer,"But the trolls were the best part! Do the characters still say ""troll-y"" instead of ""cool?"""
Homer,"Oh, that is so untroll-y!"
Homer,British Fonzie is right. Our story is actually more important... than money.
Homer,Somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.
Homer,Kansas City.
Homer,Woo-hoo! All right!
Homer,"Well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- that's something."
Homer,"Hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you."
Homer,You switched the drives?
Homer,So... why are you here? Is it about that unauthorized Krusty lookalike I hired for Lisa's first communion? What was his name?
Homer,This party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan.
Homer,"Mr. Burns, so glad you're here! Finally the party can get started!"
Homer,"Good one... uh... Mr. Burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke."
Homer,"C'mon, just pick a popular song."
Homer,"Just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog."
Homer,GOING UP SHE GOES! UP SHE GOES!
Homer,"...So he says, ""Bigamy is having one too many wives."" To which I replied, ""So's monogamy."""
Homer,"It's never good. I always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet..."
Homer,"The last thing I understood in that was ""pants."""
Homer,"Well, in that case..."
Homer,Woo hoo! No more church!
Homer,"So long, Sector 7-G...hello, Sector 22-F!"
Homer,"You know, you're kind of a downer."
Homer,I thought you were retiring. Why are you still here?
Homer,"Uh-oh, a meeting with the Mayor. How do I prepare for that?"
Homer,"I see. Now, how do I prepare for the meeting with the Mayor?"
Homer,"I am really enjoying this, but, um... Hello! Meeting with the Mayor?"
Homer,Awww... bourbon go bye-bye.
Homer,"Yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect."
Homer,"Wow, I can't believe I'm eating steak with the Mayor. The next time I vote for you it's gonna be on purpose."
Homer,I've outgrown you!
Homer,"Ah, Mr. Mayor! More peanut nore?"
Homer,"Wow, these seats are amazing."
Homer,Bo-ring.
Homer,"God, what a great game! And you too can be on the winning team, Mr. Mayor. The Springfield Nuclear Team."
Homer,I can't believe that was work!
Homer,"Oh, well..."
Homer,I really should look at this picture a little longer.
Homer,"Okay, let's go."
Homer,Can you be my dad?
Homer,"It's a rat race, but it looks like I won."
Homer,"Oh sorry, sweetie. Bart can read it to you."
Homer,And kiss.
Homer,"Please, Lisa. I had eighteen martinis today."
Homer,Close enough.
Homer,My work is so meaningless.
Homer,"You can't touch electricity, Marge. You can't feel it."
Homer,"It already is killing me, Marge. You're the only one I can talk to. My wife just doesn't get it."
Homer,"My job is my wife. Loneliness, my mistress. Despair, my sex buddy. Angst is a chick I met online, but then it turned out it was really a guy."
Homer,You don't understand me. Only she understands me.
Homer,"Another round, kid?"
Homer,Uh... I got here after you did.
Homer,"Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking..."
Homer,"Of course, of course. Family is everything to us company men. Now, where shall we go on your vacation?"
Homer,"That's great, let me run the numbers because I really want the Simpson account. And give these cigars to your children."
Homer,You're not a client. You're the client.
Homer,I'll handle it. I always do.
Homer,"Mr. Burns, I can't go rafting with you because-- wait a minute, could this all work?"
Homer,Oh no you don't.
Homer,"It all fits. Mr. Burns, rafting it is."
Homer,"Now relax, Dottie. Leave everything to me."
Homer,"Oh Marge, this is the most romantic trip you ever nagged me into."
Homer,"Not sure what you're going for, but"
Homer,"Uh... Marge, why don't I catch us some salmon?"
Homer,"Well I, uh, found that contact lens I was missing. Lemme just screw her back in."
Homer,"So, everybody good?"
Homer,"Uh-oh. If you've got that, then..."
Homer,Enjoy the outdoors you stupid kid!
Homer,This family time is so precious. Gotta go.
Homer,"Let's see, my family gives me love and sex. My work gives me money and sleep..."
Homer,My co-workers are like a family. But in some ways my family is like a family too...
Homer,Whose side are you on?
Homer,"Thanks. Now if you'll excuse me, I don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old Simpson family fun."
Homer,"Hey kids, I'm it!"
Homer,I'm okay! And I found some gold!
Homer,"Yep, your worries are over. I'm back to being a boring old Safety Inspector at a nuclear power plant."
Homer,It's closing?! But where will people find clips of old TV shows if they're not housed in a giant building? Where? Where?
Homer,Bart! Thank God I had this in my pocket.
Homer,My pants are splitting wide open!
Homer,And people will see my tattoo of Donald Duck smoking a doob! That was for Marge's eyes only! Oh my God!
Homer,Fatso Flanagan!
Homer,Only the funniest black-and-white man ever!
Homer,"Everything's a rip-off of ""The Honeymooners."" Margie, you're the greatest."
Homer,They were so childless and miserable.
Homer,How would you know?
Homer,"Now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?"
Homer,Would I!
Homer,Now I hate him too.
Homer,What about mimes?
Homer,"Good one, boy."
Homer,Everything's perfect about the past except how it led to the present!
Homer,"Wow, I can't believe we're in the audience of a pay-cable show!"
Homer,"I'll never eat turkey again. Marge, we got any ham?"
Homer,Christmas card photos?!!
Homer,"Are we done yet? ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is about to start. I wonder what my life would've been like if I'd never seen that movie..."
Homer,Shut up!
Homer,"Oh Marge, how would you like some ""future sex""?"
Homer,I meant a week from tomorrow. That's when the new penis gets here.
Homer,"Ooo, a b-mail!"
Homer,"Hey, I got a b-mail too! ""You have won a valuable prize! Open now""..."
Homer,Too late!
Homer,"Yeah, after I stopped drinking, this was a way to stay close to my bottles."
Homer,I'd smash 'em all for one lousy beer.
Homer,"No, I just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke."
Homer,Who wants to go to the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?
Homer,"Hey, sweetie. Marge said there was some family tension. And at Christmas of all times."
Homer,"""Bloody Harry"" -- he brought back beheading in a big way! Now, I'm gonna show these boys downtown Springfield."
Homer,"No, don't worry, I have my invisibility cloak. Now where did I put it?"
Homer,This is where my father is.
Homer,"He froze himself because he was sick, and there was no cure."
Homer,"Oh, they found it. But don't tell him. This is way cheaper than a nursing home."
Homer,"Dad, these are your great-grandsons."
Homer,See you next Christmas!
Homer,"To prove a point. Everyone thinks their Dad's a jerk and everyone's right. But when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em."
Homer,"Your Dad may be a little immature, but I know he loves you, so you ought to give him a chance."
Homer,Is it snowing down here?
Homer,"If those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father, then maybe I can forgive..."
Homer,"I love you, Dad."
Homer,Finally. The only thing I wait in lines this long for are for slightly-better cell phones.
Homer,I just don't understand the world of grownups.
Homer,Absolutely. Let me just redistribute our thingies amongst our various bags.
Homer,High school yearbooks...
Homer,Don't argue in front of the airport line. Strangers are judging our marriage!
Homer,"Marge, do we really need all these feminine products?"
Homer,"Yes, but I never use that kind of toothpaste!"
Homer,Try to catch one on your tongue.
Homer,Woo hoo! Can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where I carry my stress.
Homer,"Now, if I fart, that's 'cause I'm so relaxed."
Homer,Yes there is! Woo hoo.
Homer,Huh? What the--
Homer,But I have to go to the bathroom!
Homer,Don't tread on pee! We probably have rights!
Homer,Airlines don't treat people like people anymore!
Homer,You make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! And watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun!
Homer,Never putting me next to a pretty girl...
Homer,"Look, all I want is what everybody wants: preferential treatment!"
Homer,"You can check my carry-on, but you can't check my spirit! And why is there moisture between the windows?! And don't wake me up to land! Just land!"
Homer,I regret nothing... except this part!
Homer,"I'm still gonna make my flight, right? 'Cause if not, you have to put me up in a first class hotel... that's how it works. I..."
Homer,You can't check my spirit!
Homer,And why is there moisture in between the windows?!
Homer,And don't wake me up to land!
Homer,What gave me away?
Homer,"Because of that dumb viral video with a hundred and fifty million hits, I can't go out in public."
Homer,"They love me! The quiet Homer Simpson that kept it all bottled up inside is dead. This is the birth of Homer Simpson, blowhard! I'm on the roll of my life! Gimme a scratcher!"
Homer,Give me another one!
Homer,Almost a winner!
Homer,Woo hoo! I'm famous again!
Homer,"Well, if I could explain myself..."
Homer,Yes. Yes! Got it!
Homer,Not so fast!
Homer,"Now, I may not be some mani-pedied TV blowhard..."
Homer,"But I do speak for the common man who does his lousy job, goes to church twice a year and watches women's tennis 'cause he likes to hear 'em grunt. I bet Chuck the cameraman and Steve the sound guy know where I'm coming from."
Homer,"Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about! Those real people out there who buy their coffee from the mini-mart, and grab enough sugar packs for a week! Honest, hardworking, sugar-stealing Americans!"
Homer,"Aw, son. Now I regret bad-mouthing you to that girl you liked."
Homer,Finally. But I want to do it my way: classy and sophisticated.
Homer,"Welcome to ""Gut Check With Homer Simpson""! Where the truth is served, with a side of in your face!"
Homer,I am Homer Simpson.
Homer,America's latest teller of truth with a book deal on the side.
Homer,Audio book read by Lenny. I'm not just another loudmouth. I'm a loudmouth who says things you're afraid to say BUT NOT RACIST THINGS!
Homer,Let's go to the map.
Homer,"Zoomy, zoomy, zoomy Dateline, Nebraska."
Homer,"A high school principal has decided that football is too dangerous, so he's replacing it with soccer!"
Homer,Goodnight and good gravy.
Homer,"Are you ready for Irish announcers with lyrical accents, ""Oh, that's a lovely touch! Oh, such beautiful form!"" If we lose football, we lose the blitz, cheerleaders, Rudys, Ochocincos... something for fat kids to play! Ochocincos..."
Homer,"Oh yeah, that's right. It's already happening, people. Hoard your toilet paper! Shoot the mailman! Shoot the mailman!"
Homer,This is going so great. I'm already a Halloween mask.
Homer,It's still a great honor!
Homer,"Great question. I know you children have never seen your father cry before... Marge, do we have any more gravy?"
Homer,Why? Oh why?
Homer,"Oh Marge, don't worry. People know I'm doing a character, like Stephen Colbert, or Newt Gingrich."
Homer,"Welcome back to ""Gut Check."" I have something very, very pro-American to share with you. Come with me."
Homer,"Death to America! I mean, over here."
Homer,"You all know I'm a big fan of American meat. Although, sometimes you've gotta cut off some of the gristle."
Homer,"Take that, centers of art and commerce. And this country has something extra that makes our meat the juiciest, most melt-in-your-mouth, stay-in-your-heart meat in the world. That's right, I'm talkin' about the gravy of freedom!"
Homer,"When March Madness spills into April -- that's the gravy! When someone messes with you, and you invade the country that did it plus another one -- that's the gravy! When you stick your flag in the moon and say ""now we're done tryin'"" -- that's the gravy!"
Homer,So get on the boat... the gravy boat.
Homer,"Great show, people. Great show. Um... Not a big deal, but next time can we use real gravy instead of brown paint? Not a big deal."
Homer,Just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an I.O.U.
Homer,"Don't worry, sweetie. I think I know how to whip up an audience just short of a frenzy."
Homer,"Marge, I'm going to meet with the Republican establishment and pick their nominee! If there's sandwiches there, you want me to bring some back?"
Homer,Then what percent above one hundred are you behind me?
Homer,Only one hundred percent?
Homer,"Now Lisa, I'm an entertainer. And you can't entertain and inform at the same time. And if you're Access Hollywood, you do neither!"
Homer,I don't know. Can't we get Chris Christie to run?
Homer,"Eh, maybe I'll vote democrat. The great thing is when they get in they act like Republicans."
Homer,Ted Nugent! I made love on my honeymoon to your sweet music. You're my man.
Homer,"Oh, yes."
Homer,Huh? Who's there?
Homer,Mozart!
Homer,Can we get some pizza on the way?
Homer,They sell some at the gas station.
Homer,"So, how come your picture's not on money?"
Homer,Do you give 'em out for fans? 'Cause I'm a fan.
Homer,What's this? Some kind of bi-centennial lemon party?
Homer,Nerds! You want I should mess 'em up?
Homer,But gravy is the freedom where--
Homer,Congress shall have the Power To lay and collect Taxes... no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other Staaaate...
Homer,"No, no, John Hancock! I don't need insurance! Sam Adams, I'm sorry I made fun of your winter ale!"
Homer,"It was all a dream! Oh Marge, Oscar Madison came to me and told me that politics are serious and important!"
Homer,"Lisa, you were right! I'm not going to endorse anybody for anything!"
Homer,"Yes, the will of the people should not be subverted by demagogues who... hey, what's this?"
Homer,Springfield Colonial Village?!
Homer,What the?
Homer,"You faked it?! Lisa, how could you?!"
Homer,That's what a play within a play is for!
Homer,"Well, if there's one thing I don't like being taught, it's a lesson. I'm so mad. Not only will I endorse Ted Nugent...but I will call for an end to the direct election of senators."
Homer,Really? That made sense? Then I'm definitely doing it.
Homer,"Folks, because I love democracy so much, I command you to vote for this man whom I alone have selected as your next President:"
Homer,"Now to baptize his candidacy with my tears. The words ""strutting stadium rocker"" are overused these days, but when I first met Ted Nugent..."
Homer,What? My emotions were so powerful...
Homer,It's not working... But why?
Homer,"Oh my God, she's right. My lips will say anything, but my eyes know the truth. My ears are keeping their mouth shut."
Homer,My fellow Americans... I am full of crap.
Homer,I GOT A GOOD SONG FEVER / A TED NUGENT FEVER / SOMETHING SOMETHING FEVER...
Homer,I GOT THIS SONG FEVER
Homer,WE GOT AMERICA FEVER / WE GOT AMERICA FEVER!
Homer,"U.S. OF A! Great song, Ted. When's our next gig? Are we goin' to New York, or--"
Homer,Leave her alone! That's my only talking daughter!
Homer,Down in front!
Homer,Dammit! Why do kids have heads?
Homer,But I'm invested in the characters.
Homer,I make my own turnoffs.
Homer,"And that, kids, is how you stick it to the Towne Centre Real Estate Investment Trust. No, no, no. Woo hoo!"
Homer,"No, no, no, no, let's see how long we can keep 'em waiting. Everyone act like we're buckling up to go home."
Homer,"Marge, if you were married to Da Vinci, you wouldn't tell him not to Da Vinch."
Homer,Leaving? Why on earth would you think that?
Homer,And ours!
Homer,"This place is so great. When the trolley hits you, it doesn't even hurt."
Homer,"You try it, Maggie!"
Homer,Do-over!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero.
Homer,Draw the curtain.
Homer,"Sir, as a complexion scientist, I must advise you against using any more. This is the most powerful hydrator we sell."
Homer,"Less blathering, more slathering."
Homer,I don't trust this place. Where are the cashiers?
Homer,I'll take it! Provided you charge me for services that Google offers for free.
Homer,Sweet!
Homer,"This computer is so great! I'm watching the latest Sofia Coppola movie at ""twenty times"" speed to make it seem like a normal movie."
Homer,"Aw, sweetie. Hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?"
Homer,Let me just download the complete works of Shakespeare.
Homer,Now who's the greatest writer of all time?
Homer,And I've created something that created something incredibly popular!
Homer,You never showed it to me.
Homer,I still wanna see it.
Homer,Then why did you say it?
Homer,Are you just saying that 'cause you don't want me to see the hippo?
Homer,"Man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer."
Homer,I am sitting here... zero sheets to the wind...
Homer,"...counting the moments to closing time when I can stumble home to you. Another round, Moe. Uh-oh. Did I type that? Delete! Delete! Hm, typing ""delete"" does not delete."
Homer,What the! That idiot cut me off!
Homer,"I'm gonna run his plates, find out who he is, then change his SpringFace profile picture to a shot of a monkey. Get that, Marge? A monkey!"
Homer,Right. Status update: Homer... is... watching... the...
Homer,Marco!
Homer,"Come on, Lisa!"
Homer,Fish out of water!
Homer,"...and that's why I really don't believe there's a God. Thank you, and God bless America."
Homer,Well I'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere.
Homer,Witty.
Homer,Needs flavor.
Homer,That's better.
Homer,Oxygen... I need oxygen.
Homer,"Oh Marge, this is brilliant."
Homer,"We show girls love on Valentine's Day, and they let us blow stuff up on the Fourth of July. I just pray they never fall on the same day."
Homer,Thanks for reading it to me.
Homer,Which one do you want?
Homer,"You have the most wonderful Mom in the world, which is why I have no idea where she is or what she's doing."
Homer,"That's right, sucker! It's Valentine's Day, and I've got a date with some fastballs!"
Homer,"Almost there, boy. Almost there. Almost there."
Homer,I'm getting' closer. It's just within reach.
Homer,"Well, your arms are lanky. It's kind of a long trip down there."
Homer,"Hm, the French have gotten into the wine game. Good luck catchin' up with the big boys."
Homer,"So, Dad, what kind of stupid idea did you put in Lisa's head?"
Homer,"Did you say ""ultimate Frisbee?"""
Homer,"Women and shoes, am I right?"
Homer,"Don't worry, ladies! I'm-a comin'!"
Homer,"You know, I heard if a fat guy stops moving, he floats."
Homer,"Sorry, Dad. I was afraid the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up."
Homer,Then why am I paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance?
Homer,"Lisa, everyone knows dragons do not attack cars. Jeez, pick up a book."
Homer,Then you have a serious reading problem.
Homer,So do your farting now.
Homer,"Don't worry. My last words will be ""I can outrun that lion."""
Homer,"All right, everybody in!"
Homer,Two can play at that game.
Homer,I can do this... I can do this...
Homer,"Boy, I told you an hour ago. Stop that!"
Homer,And I can drive drunk while I'm actually sober!
Homer,"It's fun, but not as fun."
Homer,"Oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing?"
Homer,"Yeah. We're like family to you. I'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy."
Homer,We won! Woo hoo!
Homer,"Now, now, now just a second here! Now, I know we're not perfect. But, uh, I believe it was Sammy Hagar who said--"
Homer,"I always thought ""tarred and feathered"" was just a figure of speech."
Homer,Good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now!
Homer,"Wait! If you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought."
Homer,I mean a thousand-year flood!
Homer,I mean a thousand years of perfect weather.
Homer,"Soda, eh?"
Homer,"Oh, let's face it. I'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. And there's only one way out: I've gotta man up. Okay, manning up... manning up. Mannning-- Girling down! Girling down!"
Homer,Fine.
Homer,Please. Put that down.
Homer,Not you! Him!
Homer,"We found a new home! When God shuts a door, he opens a window."
Homer,"Eh, I'm sick of watching Fox. Let's get some fresh air. I got the ATV's right out back."
Homer,Helmet? That's Springfield talk.
Homer,Springfield talk!
Homer,Private plane crashes.
Homer,"Yep, I never realized how much I hated every single one of my friends and relatives."
Homer,Well I've got a really big secret for you... I'm not wearing any underwear.
Homer,"Hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes."
Homer,"Pipe down, boy. I'm sneaking you back into Springfield."
Homer,"Oh, ""Smithers""!"
Homer,"Pish tosh, Smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! Nailed it!"
Homer,Excellent.
Homer,"You know what's great about you, Marge? After all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you."
Homer,Do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets?
Homer,Strike! Woo hoo!
Homer,Ever since the day we met.
Homer,The old homestead. Remember when we moved in and I talked like this?
Homer,There's no sex like fugitive sex.
Homer,Someone's downstairs!
Homer,All right! You caught us. What are you gonna do about it? Throw us out of town again?
Homer,We hate opera!
Homer,Nooo!
Homer,Yeah. Non-jerks!
Homer,"Well, I've tightened the bolt! I think we're good!"
Homer,"This is the outlands, boy. Ideas aren't good or bad, they're just free! Power on!"
Homer,"I was wrong, there are bad ideas! There are terrible ideas!"
Homer,Now I'm over here!
Homer,"Hey Lenny, welcome aboard."
Homer,"Now, I gotta warn you, if you find a little black thing on your pillow, it won't be a mint."
Homer,"Let her slice off the tip of your ear, and she'll go right to sleep."
Homer,That's not a choice you get to make.
Homer,Forget it. We don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves.
Homer,"Well, I rented that plane."
Homer,"True, true."
Homer,Yes! Awake! Let's do this!
Homer,"You know sweetie, there was a time when I would've killed for that information, but I'm pleased to announce I've already bought your mother a present."
Homer,And brace yourself: I put some thought into it.
Homer,It's a state-of-the-art food mash-'em-upper.
Homer,"Love?! Your Mom's gonna feel so good it'll make mere ""love"" seem like chewing tinfoil. Because today I'm getting it autographed."
Homer,By the box lady herself!
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"Man, oh man, look at this place! Finally, a supermarket with a clear premise: island something."
Homer,Wow. I don't believe the Simpsons will be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart anymore.
Homer,Apu! What are you doing out of your natural habitat?
Homer,Friends are the only people you can betray! And you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!
Homer,Would you sign this for my wife Marge? She's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.
Homer,"You would do that? Oh my God, this might be a Marge's birthday where I get sex!"
Homer,"Wait one sec, Marge. Before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever."
Homer,"The only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. Now in three... two... one..."
Homer,I repeat. One...
Homer,Onnnnnnneee...
Homer,...Onnneee... onnneee...
Homer,Onnneee.
Homer,This yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! From her show!
Homer,A pity kiss?! That tears it! I'm gonna call that Paula Paul and give her a piece of my mind!
Homer,The phone's dead.
Homer,"Normal, normal, normal, normal... uncharacteristic?! Hm, a chew-through. What could have..."
Homer,Aw... I mean arrrgh!
Homer,You let this monster into our home! Where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!
Homer,"Why you little... I'm gonna get... No, Homer. You can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. Juries hate that. So instead, boy, I want you to... get in that rabbit cage!"
Homer,No backtalk! In the cage! Now!
Homer,Get in there!
Homer,"Son, do you have a minute?"
Homer,I've been thinking. I really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. So I'm gonna let you out with my apologies.
Homer,What?
Homer,"Boy, get out of that cage!"
Homer,I'll poke a broom in there! You know I'm capable of it!
Homer,Stupid kid.
Homer,This isn't comfortable at all! I don't see how a rabbit could possibly--
Homer,DRI-VING-TO-WORK!
Homer,Wait a minute... that guy on the poster looks familiar.
Homer,"Don't just stare back at me, come up with a theory! Geez, it's all over the place. Holy Moly."
Homer,"Heard about this thing, boy?"
Homer,"Hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?"
Homer,"Not now, Marge!"
Homer,"Boy, you like this necklace I just bought?"
Homer,"Pretty dope, don't you think?"
Homer,"Hey Bart, check this out."
Homer,"Look at me, I'm Mr. Fatso! It's funny 'cause it's so preposterous."
Homer,What the--
Homer,What? No! It can't be!
Homer,Shut up! I'll fix you!
Homer,"Yes, master."
Homer,"Here car. Here, boy."
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Pay for your genius!
Homer,"Oh, what's the use? When a man isn't a hero to his son, he's nothing."
Homer,"Well, we do."
Homer,You just ruined my car.
Homer,"Five hundred dollars? Woo-hoo! Thanks, boy."
Homer,"Really, anyone? What about the Hulk riding a rhinoceros? Would you stop him from laughing?"
Homer,"Both, but the rhinoceros doesn't know why. He's just trying to fit in."
Homer,"Chief, I believe I have the answer in the back of my car."
Homer,Did you guys see that stupid foul call in the game last night?
Homer,Unguarded stuffff...!
Homer,"Attention, lovers of free office supplies! Come and steal things you can easily afford!"
Homer,"Mr. Burns! Save me, panic!"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,How ya doin' there?
Homer,"Well sir, before I do anything I stop and ask myself, ""What would Jesus and Mr. Burns do?"""
Homer,"Y'know boy, my dad used to take me fishing just like this."
Homer,More angry texts from work!
Homer,"Hey, it's called ""karma."""
Homer,A common misconception.
Homer,"Suck it, karma! Yeah! I'm talkin' to you, karma! Karma's a bitch, karma!"
Homer,"Nothin' better than a lazy Saturday morning, lying in a warm, moist bed. Because weekends are-- Moist?!"
Homer,I wet the bed! The one embarrassing thing I've never done!
Homer,"Marge, from time to time I've heard you speak of a ""washing"" ""machine."" Where would I find this marvelous contraption?"
Homer,"Not just the laundry... That would be weird, and you might ask questions. I wanna do all the chores!"
Homer,"Don't yell at me, brain! This happened on your watch! You have two jobs: thinking and bladder control!"
Homer,"I like to watch Lamar Odom play X-Box while his giant wife yells at him. Is that so nuts? Huh? Yeah, shut you up."
Homer,"Now, I'm sure yesterday's incident of urination domination was a one-time deal. But just to make sure..."
Homer,Why can't I cork my wang-wine?
Homer,But isn't karma just an expression of the dharma?
Homer,"Deep down, I must be feeling guilty about getting my friends in trouble! And my problem won't stop till I make things right with them. But first, a little more sleep."
Homer,"I'm sorry. Cheese on that? Sorry. Hey, Lenny. Sorry."
Homer,"One more announcement: make sure you whack ""piñata me"" and not real me."
Homer,"So, I gotta know... do you guys forgive me?"
Homer,Free? Uh...
Homer,Free it is!
Homer,"Thanks, guys. Tomorrow morning my sheets will be as dry as the surface of Mars except for the poles."
Homer,What the?! Wet again?! I did the right thing for nothing! There's only one solution left.
Homer,Okay... Place detection pad here... connect alarm hookup... there!
Homer,Now that's what I call looking out for number one.
Homer,"Um, uh... probably just the fire alarm -- try to go back to sleep."
Homer,You stupid...
Homer,"Son, I'm afraid the Uralarm Whiz-no-more 9000 is no joke."
Homer,"Kids, there's something I have to tell you -- your mother and I are wetting the bed."
Homer,"Hey, when you were pregnant everything was ""we."""
Homer,What?
Homer,What about Cupid? He's smokin' hot.
Homer,"Marge, it's not the diaper, it's what's inside."
Homer,BUM-BA-BUM-BA / BUM-BA-BUM-BA...
Homer,"Hey, guys! Whatcha doing in my dream?"
Homer,What do I do?
Homer,My brain's fine! In my dreams I'm an intermediate skier!
Homer,Ski patrol! Everyone be cool!
Homer,"Great, now Death knows."
Homer,Um nothing... typical dream nonsense.
Homer,I know this dream! It's the land of my innermost thoughts and fondest desires!
Homer,"Uh, Marge, this is my friend Keggy..."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Oh, lighten up, Marge. I take you to the Disneyland of me, and you just wanna go to the Lost and Found. Well guess what? We're stayin' in this dream forever!"
Homer,Whee! I'm in me! / Oh! / I love the down parts! Here comes!
Homer,Quick! Gum up the gears with Moes!
Homer,"Oh Death, you're a lifesaver!"
Homer,"Thank you, Death. And may I ask what's taking so long with Larry King?"
Homer,Mom?!
Homer,Just like my hair.
Homer,"Exactly like Chandler, always criticizing."
Homer,Wow!
Homer,Roomy.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,There's nothing in this dream world that can't strangle you!
Homer,You left him because I tipped the boat over and ruined the vacation!
Homer,"It's true! I failed the basic duty of childhood. And then when I took Bart fishing, it all came back -- and the guilt made me wet the bed!"
Homer,I'm cured. I'll never wet the bed again.
Homer,"No can do, baby."
Homer,Goodbye.
Homer,"Woo-hoo! I'm dry! Come on, everybody! Feel daddy's underpants!"
Homer,So what do I do again?
Homer,All right.
Homer,"Look at it go! All right! Hey, since it's a dream, let's ride our bikes naked around town."
Homer,"It's just dream hail! Ow! Oh! Ow! Dream hail! Hey, there's a dream truck!"
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,Woo hoo! Thank God it's T.G.I.F!
Homer,"You're outta here, drug-o."
Homer,Well... I didn't really feel like going to Moe's today... thought I might hang out here for as long as I can take it.
Homer,Yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. I did it when I was in that alcohol-induced coma.
Homer,"So, what's on the agenda?"
Homer,Why did I do that? / It sounds so dull and boring. / What was I thinking?
Homer,"What the-- Section 1 of Article 21 of the State Constitution is amended to read: Section 1. In the year following the year in which the national census is taken under the direction of Congress at the beginning of each decade, the Legislature shall adjust the boundary lines of Congressional, State Senate and Assembly districts. Liquor... mustn't think of liquor..."
Homer,"So, a sober weekend hasn't been that hard. Let me just take a few antidepressants here."
Homer,I feel sorry for people without willpower. I truly do.
Homer,A surprisingly not-horrible fruit drink called a mimosa.
Homer,Then there's champagne in me! What am I gonna do? It's less than twenty-four hours till my drug test. Maybe I can sweat it out.
Homer,"Oh man, I'd better have some coffee and iced tea."
Homer,What about this lemonade?
Homer,"Then I'd better soak up the alcohol with some food! Oooh, cake!"
Homer,Crepes!
Homer,Cherries!
Homer,Jubilee!
Homer,"Oh Lord, I have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. If you can weasel me out of this physical, I will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. Amen. Now to mumble in a religious fashion. Dear God, oh, Lord oh God, oh, Lord..."
Homer,Comicon nerds!
Homer,A must!
Homer,"Mr. Burns, before I leave, I've got a few things to get off my chest: one: I liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push ""popcorn"". You don't have to know how long. Two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. Three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? You know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. So to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought."
Homer,Does the chair go back like this?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Nice parking, idiot."
Homer,"So, uh, you guys are my new coworkers."
Homer,"So, workin' hard or hardly workin'?"
Homer,"I said, workin' hard or hardly working? Working hard or hardly working?! WORKING HARD OR HARDLY WORKING?!"
Homer,It's a simple question! Are you A: Working hard or B:
Homer,"I guess I just met the joker of the group. Better watch out for you on April Fool's Day, am I right? I said, am I right? Am I r--"
Homer,So you guys have any luck finding a new job?
Homer,"Hey, I've gotta tell ya, I'm miserable there. I'm all alone; and when there's some problem due to human error, guess who gets blamed?"
Homer,Maybe I should be heading home.
Homer,"WHEN THE MOON HITS YOUR EYE / LIKE A BIG PIZZA PIE / THAT'S AMORE / WHEN THE WORLD SEEMS... When you do chair gondola all by yourself, it almost seems stupid."
Homer,"Ah, here it is: Hydraulic systems flush... EEPROM bios autoboot... conversation mode? They can talk?!"
Homer,"I just have to press this button, right..."
Homer,"Well, at least it doesn't feel pain."
Homer,Wait a minute...

Homer,That's exactly what I'm having! You guys totally get me.
Homer,Could you give my wife a few lessons?
Homer,Yeah. So uh... it's five o'clock. Time for Moe's.
Homer,Let's go!
Homer,What happened to you guys? You used to be cool.
Homer,We're the same temperature we've always been.
Homer,Play balll!

Homer,"Uh, right, right... actually, I'm the designated hitter for all you guys."
Homer,Fine. Don't get your circuits in a bunch.
Homer,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!!
Homer,I got it...
Homer,I got it...
Homer,I said I've got it!
Homer,That could've been my motherboard lying in the street!
Homer,"And here I was waiting till you slept to rob you of your copper. You know, it's crazy, but..."
Homer,"Hush, bionic prince, as I cradle your waning form."
Homer,Such a peaceful end.

Homer,"Axels to axels, rust to rust, amen."
Homer,No! I'm already using it to put my keys in!

Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, save your breath."
Homer,I have some adjustments to make.
Homer,When I'm done with my robo-botomies.
Homer,"Flanders, I don't judge a robot by the color of their eyes. I look at their hands, which have turned into buzz saws."
Homer,Sonofa-- Why did you do that?
Homer,"Just say ""kill me,"" jerks!"
Homer,I'm doomed! Can they climb stairs?
Homer,I'm doomed!
Homer,Robots... trying to kill me... and now they'll kill you... 'cause I led them here...
Homer,Aren't we getting num-nums?
Homer,"Sorry. Before we die, can you tell me how old you really are?"
Homer,"Guys, thank you. The words ""prime directive"" get thrown around a lot these days, but I'm glad yours was saving me. The saddest part is none of this had to happen, if Mr. Burns had simply trusted the human worker. Or if someone, anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings."
Homer,And his arm can be my back-scratcher.
Homer,I'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.
Homer,Then take us out to sea.
Homer,"Oh, I believe you, but Flanders' drill doesn't."
Homer,"Oh, this is the life."
Homer,Hey!
Homer,"Okay, what's an appropriate movie for you boys?"
Homer,No... no...
Homer,"Ooo, here's one: ""Happy Little Elves Two: The Sequelf."" Two kids."
Homer,Watch whatever you want -- I got you here alive. Now I'm gonna visit the only court I could never be in contempt of: food court.
Homer,"Now, to save on calories, I won't eat the paper in the fortune cookie."
Homer,Closer than you think!
Homer,Sure. What's your name?
Homer,Long enough that me and Marge can be one of those couples who just sit and hold hands.
Homer,Ooh!
Homer,Gotta have that!
Homer,Lovin' it!
Homer,Keep 'em comin'!
Homer,It's programmed to my specifications!
Homer,But I can't afford this...
Homer,No.
Homer,Easy!
Homer,"C'mon, boy. We've gotta go home. I saved big bucks on the delivery charges."
Homer,Ahhh. Doesn't get any better than this.
Homer,"Huh, that's weird, my armpits are gettin' wet."
Homer,Hmm...
Homer,Seen it.
Homer,Seen it.
Homer,Seen it.
Homer,British version was better.
Homer,Totally scripted.
Homer,Sued it.
Homer,Stranded? What's that?
Homer,"Well, islands are always entertaining, from Gilligan to Iwo Jima."
Homer,A plane crash!
Homer,Wait a minute... that flashback raised more questions than it answered?!
Homer,What a great opening episode. And I'm sure everything they said will pay off handsomely!
Homer,"You know, I should get back to the treadmill."
Homer,"The lava being! That's why they showed a clip of it on ""previously on."""
Homer,"Marge, there're so many mysteries that I need to have solved."
Homer,"Now, if the Korean couple can't speak English, why were they doing a crossword puzzle where the answer to twenty-three down was ""enigma"" spelled backwards? What does it mean?"
Homer,And where will I watch TV?
Homer,And where will I walk?
Homer,And where...
Homer,We've had stupider!
Homer,At last! This episode promises to finally answer one question!
Homer,Homie!
Homer,The kids are away and Maggie's napping...
Homer,"Ooh, that's great! Can it wait another hundred and four hours?"
Homer,She walked away and slammed the door. What does it mean? What does it mean?
Homer,Oh that's such a first-take answer!
Homer,"Thank you all for coming to my ""Stranded"" discussion group!"
Homer,"Spoiler alert! I've only seen up to season three, episode seventeen: ""Coconut Cream Die."""
Homer,Spoiler!
Homer,Spoil-er!
Homer,"I'm sorry, sweetie. It's just a Strandie discussion group. Yes it is! We discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die."
Homer,"Thanks, Marge. You ruined my show. Now I'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now."
Homer,"Lousy Marge... ruining the delicate relationship between a man and his TV show... I'd tell my best friend, but that's Marge too..."
Homer,Well...
Homer,"Okay, but if this house starts a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'."
Homer,"Again with ""Mr. Steak!"" Do you know why I go to Mr. Steak? Because at Mr. Steak they don't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at Mr. Steak!"
Homer,Why don't you talk to Mrs. Steak?
Homer,Bart! There's a really mean squirrel in the back yard. I need you to dare me to fight him!
Homer,Bart's been raptured! And his crap's been craptured!
Homer,"Nice doin' business with you, boy."
Homer,What happened to my mini-pool table? I was training to be a mini-pool hustler.
Homer,I never even got to realize this jacket was too small.
Homer,"Oh, Marge... your names..."
Homer,"Yeah, for you kids maybe. For dads, a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job! ""Are you wearing enough sun block?"" ""Is that splashing or drowning?"""
Homer,Why does every sand castle require my participation?
Homer,Then a kid disappears and it's total panic until you find him at the swim-up bar...
Homer,...eating a thirty-dollar cheeseburger! Which he drops in the water!
Homer,And here's the worst part: I never get any time alone with my wife because we're all sleeping in the same room!
Homer,WORTH IT TO BE RI-IGHT! WORTH IT TO BE RI-IGHT!
Homer,Sex on a family vacation? I never thought such a thing was possible!
Homer,And the ocean'll do all of the work!
Homer,"Ocean sex rules! Go to Hell, land sex!"
Homer,"Boy, thanks to you, we're having fun -- ""before you were born"" fun."
Homer,"I'unno... Lotta barefoot kids kicking soccer balls, shell necklaces... they really hid the poverty nicely."
Homer,"Worthless, worthless, worthless..."
Homer,Can I put my hand through you?
Homer,"Yeah, and the customer service on this cruise has really gone downhill."
Homer,"Man, I kicked butt in the gladiator arena today! I won the last package of hot dogs on the ship! I got robbed by marauders on the way home."
Homer,What about the duty-free stuff we bought?
Homer,My booze and cologne!
Homer,Choke on my numb blue hands!
Homer,"Yeah stupid, stop thinking about fun and have it!"
Homer,"Hey, wait for me!"
Homer,Now that's what I call going for a spin!
Homer,Now that's what I call a snappy retort!
Homer,He turned that Russian guy into Swiss cheese!
Homer,Looks like that guy's got turret's syndrome!
Homer,"Swiss cheese. Marge, how come you're not saying anything?"
Homer,"Oh man, Marge is pissed. Look at her... flaring her nostrils... drumming her fingers... making small noises like she's yelling at me inside her head..."
Homer,That's what she said!
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"No, just my marriage."
Homer,"Honey, it's me again. I can't work knowing that you're mad at me. I just wanna hear your voice. And I'm counting the minutes till the whistle blows, then I go to Moe's, then I rush home to you."
Homer,But you said it so mean!
Homer,"Eight weeks paid vacation, and all because of a little bump on the noggin."
Homer,"Hey Marge, here's something that'll make you happy!"
Homer,"No, this is really good. I..."
Homer,"Now, listen, Lisa--"
Homer,"Well, I just got..."
Homer,Uh... I got... Shelbyville radio in my car for a few minutes.
Homer,But you're not...
Homer,"I have eight weeks paid vacation, and my family doesn't know."
Homer,"Honey, I'm off to work!"
Homer,You know... maybe I should call in sick. We could visit all our old romantic haunts that have closed and turned into temporary Halloween stores.
Homer,"I get it. You need your Marge time. Well, I'm off to work."
Homer,"My feet hurt, and my neck is cold."
Homer,"Man, when you're not at work, you see so many beautiful things."
Homer,"...and now because it's afternoon, I can go to Moe's without having a ""drinking problem."""
Homer,"Well, why can't I hang out at the bar all day? My wife doesn't wanna be with me."
Homer,I wish I could pull down my zipper and that guy would come out.
Homer,Stradivarius Cain!
Homer,What the? Am I losing my marbles?
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,What the? No one can see you.
Homer,"Yeah, Dr. Cain, the thing about that is... there aren't any weapons."
Homer,Sometimes Marge says I turn it into a trashcan.
Homer,Sounds like you're turning into wife number two.
Homer,But I'm a married man.
Homer,"Okay, I'll make a stranger love me forever."
Homer,My dear... did you just fall from heaven? 'Cause your hair looks really messed up.
Homer,You know what wood makes the best ventriloquist dummy: maple. How many hardboiled eggs do you think I can eat?
Homer,"When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared to the blue of your eyes."
Homer,What do I do? What do I do?
Homer,"You're right, Marge. I lied."
Homer,"I got a head injury at work, and they gave me eight weeks paid vacation."
Homer,And I spent all that time learning how to be a better husband. The kind of husband you deserve.
Homer,The three of us are going to the most romantic restaurant in town.
Homer,I have bug-bombed the car for m'lady.
Homer,"It was all a training exercise to make me smooth for you. Of course she fell for me and of course I wanted no part of her. Now, the only one who can help us is Stradivarius Cain."
Homer,I'll explain later. Strad! Come back! I know you're in there!
Homer,"No... not you... next... big fan but no... Cleatus the Football Robot, you're my only hope!"
Homer,No one likes you!
Homer,"Strad, where are you?"
Homer,"When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared with the blue of your eyes."
Homer,We used to be like them.
Homer,"Actually, I was supposed to be back last week. We'll just wait for the call from human resources."
Homer,"Well, I better get going -- this is startin' to feel a little churchy."
Homer,I already have my part: man who buys ticket but doesn't show up.
Homer,"Maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories..."
Homer,Game Six of the 2011 World Series...
Homer,...And Lenny's story about Cancun.
Homer,Just like me on Twitter!
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,I'm your Jesus! Me!
Homer,What's that a reference to?
Homer,"Ooh, nice and roomy. Our Lord sure knew how to keep 'em cool."
Homer,"Yes, sweetie?"
Homer,Whee! Whee!
Homer,"Oh yes, Lisa, very seriously. Whee."
Homer,"Oh Lord, why have you placed this fearsome burden on my shoulders?"
Homer,Does Jesus have a big part in this thing?
Homer,What?! Why do I succeed at everything I audition for?
Homer,Thou sayest it!
Homer,They cannot judge me. Only my Father can judge me.
Homer,"I'll take you with me, old man!"
Homer,"Mmm, historically inaccurate."
Homer,Ooo!
Homer,What the?
Homer,"Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves."
Homer,"Tonight, you shall be at my right hand in Heaven."
Homer,"Outta my way, stupid Flanders!"
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Ooo, licorice!"
Homer,Welcome to marriage! Another good man bites the dust.
Homer,I'm talkin' about this guy.
Homer,I sure envy him.
Homer,"I mean I envy Flanders, once again enjoying the joys of marriage. Let's put it to a vote, America."
Homer,Bart! Don't call me that!
Homer,"Why you little... they're both bad, and I suspect you know it!"
Homer,People here do not respect boundaries.
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"Great, we'll take care of everything. We'll just need to borrow your punch bowl, seventeen chairs, your portable dance floor, your banner printer, banner ink, and a ream of blank banners."
Homer,"You really put on a great reception, Marge. It's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller."
Homer,"He took the time to press the shift key, Marge! I think he knows what he's talking about."
Homer,"Oh Marge, let the kid have his embarrassing secrets and lies."
Homer,Not according to the internet!
Homer,I'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.
Homer,Because his avatar is Darth Maul! The second-coolest Darth!
Homer,And what he says is true because it's in all caps. Are you gonna argue with caps?
Homer,"Yeah, but we make sure never to go to bed hungry."
Homer,Don't tell me what our thing is.
Homer,"I've always said ""hungry""!"
Homer,I thought I heard clicks and pops!
Homer,"Welcome, money-changers! You can trust Sleazy Sam for the best rates, or my name isn't Jesus H.--"
Homer,Are you gonna do that every time I open one of these?
Homer,WILL YOU STOP THIS STUPID CRAP? / I WANNA TAKE A NAP!
Homer,What's wrong with her?
Homer,Where are they going with this?
Homer,You wanna honk your jazz tube?
Homer,I appreciate that.
Homer,"Hey, why don't we go see Lady Gaga? That'll turn your frown upside down."
Homer,What are you talking about? Y-you're right!
Homer,Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!
Homer,"I will, but you know me and my crazy number thing where I always have to get to seventeen. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Whoops, I lost count. Better start again. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!"
Homer,"Hey Lisa, come on."
Homer,No.
Homer,Wow. Wow. This is like the night Hillary won the New Hampshire Primary.
Homer,Can I just trim the hem?
Homer,"Okay Lisa, comin' up to make things better!"
Homer,"Okay, I'm almost there... upward, ever upward... stay hydrated... I'm on the wrong tree... Okay, try again... here we go, okay..."
Homer,"Lisa, can you come down?"
Homer,"Sweetie, I've been thinking. Now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself. The problem's not that you were cheating...it's that you got caught."
Homer,"I cheat on my diet but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside and the first warning sign is sudden death. So, honey, what do you say?"
Homer,Parenting. It's the one job you always know you're doing right.
Homer,"I LOVE MY HOMER FACE YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SAID / RIGHT WHERE IT SHOULD BE ON THE FRONT OF MY HEAD / STUBBLE, MUZZLE, OVERBITE, TWO EYES THAT REALLY BUG / THESE ARE THE COMPONENTS OF MY HOMER-RIFFIC MUG / D'OH, OOOH, D'OH, OOOH, / I SHAVE IT CLOSE, TRIM HAIRS FROM MY NOSE / D'OH, OOOH, D'OH, OOOH, I CLEAN MY EARS, 'CAUSE THAT'S HOW I HEARS / I LIKE MY / I LIKE MY / I REALLY LIKE MY HOMER FACE"
Homer,Wait for the gap... wait for the gap...
Homer,There's the gap!
Homer,Gap's too small!
Homer,What's goin' on?
Homer,"Boy, if anyone needs me I'll be taking a popcorn bath. It's a thing I read about in a Men's Health magazine in a dream."
Homer,"Pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle."
Homer,Well... I also keep things interesting.
Homer,"You see? Hey, what are you looking at?"
Homer,"Aw boy, I feel for ya. Nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing."
Homer,"Observe. Hey, it's me again. He's there, isn't he? Well, I hope this doesn't sound weird, but I'm inside your closet."
Homer,"Hey, it's me."
Homer,"I was thinking about you. It's your birthday in like three, four months? Would it be weird if I threw you a party?"
Homer,"...And five hundred dollars for Yankee tickets, which turn out to be bogus..."
Homer,But they're playing the Purple Sox!
Homer,"Lousy outdated relics! Boy, do you remember what happened the last time we went to New York?"
Homer,"You're dead, J.J. Get yourself buried!"
Homer,"I'm about to go owl shooting... and you just said ""who!"""
Homer,"You're sellin' milk, J.J., and I've got a sour stomach."
Homer,It didn't feel like success.
Homer,"Son, you can dial down the crazy. Your mother and I talked about it and we found a way to get to New York. It's all set, boy. To save money, we're swapping houses."
Homer,I didn't say I swapped our house.
Homer,Look at this place. Things have certainly changed since our ancestor Fievel came here.
Homer,"Yes, and now look at us. Only in America."
Homer,"Oh, geez. Not this guy, with his stupid little pushcart."
Homer,You do that.
Homer,Do you know you're missing your clothes?
Homer,"All right, I'll spring for a cab."
Homer,Much better.
Homer,"Oh-oh-oh oh, thank God you woke up!"
Homer,"You've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. After that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you can't get it together to leave. I'll get us some ice cream."
Homer,Why you little... where's that ice cream?
Homer,Damn you and your fluted neck!
Homer,I thought there was no crime in New York any more. Giulianiii!
Homer,Go where?
Homer,"Boy, you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man!"
Homer,"Aw, look at that -- my little guy's finally realizing how complicated grown-up feelings can be."
Homer,"Heh, no kidding, I saw your reviews."
Homer,"I hope you enjoyed the show tonight. And if you're worried about when the air conditioner fell on my head, rest assured it was a stunt man and his family is being well taken care of."
Homer,Do we screw them on the credit?
Homer,At least the pennant works both ways.
Homer,Lisa! Do you have a stray dog down there?
Homer,Two stray dogs?
Homer,That was gonna be my next guess!
Homer,Maybe.
Homer,"A black hole? I'm sorry, can we call it that?"
Homer,"Hey, can it open a pretzel bag for me? Help a brother out, B.H."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Come on, you can't look at that infinitely dense little guy and not want to feed it something!"
Homer,Why should--
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,I am nature's perfect choking machine!
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,Nope. / Not me. / Do we even still have that thing?
Homer,"Okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called ""Magic Craphole Waste Removal,"" but it wasn't me."
Homer,Treasures? Gifts? You got it all wrong. That stuff is just our old--
Homer,Day one.
Homer,We've bought this camera because strange things have been going on at our house in the dead of night.
Homer,"And if anyone finds this footage after we're all missing or dead, remember me as a hero."
Homer,A hero.
Homer,Hero away!
Homer,Night One. Wanna snuggle?
Homer,I turned it off.
Homer,"I swear, I am not filming."
Homer,Note to self: edit out my lies.
Homer,Wait! Don't kill the monster without me!
Homer,"I'm right behind you, honey! We have stairs?!"
Homer,What the?
Homer,"Oh, sweetie, sometimes a mysterious, invisible being from hell waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them. Now go to bed."
Homer,"Eh-eh, school night."
Homer,Now you're sure I bought enough cameras and extended warranties to catch that ghost?
Homer,"Ooh, I can't wait for tonight's massacre."
Homer,"Hey, Marge."
Homer,"Oh, like what you see, huh?"
Homer,I like it when you don't say words.
Homer,"Listen, pal, you seem like an honest guy."
Homer,Is there any other deal that you can accept?
Homer,"You, me and Marge?"
Homer,I guess it's one of those things a dad has to do...
Homer,"Now, before we start, what's the safe word?"
Homer,"Ooh, I like that. Now, I'd like to try something new if you don't mind..."
Homer,Cinnamon!
Homer,Would you go to the prom with me?
Homer,I'll get right on it.
Homer,I'm on it!
Homer,"For the third time this year, yes!"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"I gotta hand it to you, Marge. You got the exact amount of car for our family. Room for two adults, three kids, and zero Grampas."
Homer,Let Automobile Von Bismarck give it a try.
Homer,Well...
Homer,"So, you're not totally unqualified."
Homer,A reason? What could it be?
Homer,"Wow, an auto mechanic who tells the truth."
Homer,Umm... no thanks.
Homer,"Marge... do you think maybe there's another reason you don't like this car? Um... um... a ""feelings"" reason?"
Homer,"Well, maybe you and the car got off on the wrong foot. When do you think things first went wrong?"
Homer,"No, no, Marge. I want you to explore your feelings."
Homer,"An ""on purpose"" baby?"
Homer,"What about... you know... ""Stinky""?"
Homer,"Whatever you want, sweetie."
Homer,Just appreciating how lucky I am to be with you.
Homer,"And let me tell you, a towel rack will not support your weight."
Homer,X's for eyes...
Homer,"Honey, I am so sorry. I guess we'll just have to learn to love the three children we have."
Homer,"Hey, uh... hm... why don't we take the longer but nicer historic route? Then today will be nothing but beautiful memories."
Homer,Sorry guys. Private family moment.
Homer,"Eh, nothing we can do."
Homer,It's true... that's how I got the money to buy you your necklace.
Homer,"I, uh, hope it's twins!"
Homer,Watch it!
Homer,"Okay, but just for a minute. We want to hit the candle store, Fudgerama, the Zipper Hall of Fame, Snow Globe World, and The Taj Meatball."
Homer,And I got to try every flavor of candy cane: white and red.
Homer,"What's that, baby?"
Homer,"I'll take it from here, wing-man."
Homer,"Yeah, no kids to ruin it."
Homer,"Marge, I was just being a good husband by pretending to agree with you while secretly undermining your agenda."
Homer,"Uh, well, looking back, I guess it started sometime before Bart was born."
Homer,"Room for one, please."
Homer,"Honey, I'm sorry. It's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids."
Homer,"Emotionally, financially, the boy... I just didn't know how to tell you."
Homer,"Okay, good, we're talking..."
Homer,Your phone just dialed me.
Homer,"Hey, the pocket wants what it wants."
Homer,"They just leave the maple syrup on the table, huh? How about that? That's trust, huh?"
Homer,Uh-oh. I don't think I rewound the video the last time I was here.
Homer,"Um, I'd like to get back a donation made fifteen years ago by a Simpson, Homer. Or it may be under the name Thad Supersperm."
Homer,"I'll tell you what I want, Marge. I want to make another Simpson. The table with four legs is sturdier than the table with three. Cubes are made of cheese, but pyramids are schemes. And anything that's half you is guaranteed fifty percent perfect."
Homer,Are you sure there isn't more? I mean there's always a little ketchup left in the bottle.
Homer,I'd like to buy back my sample.
Homer,"Well, I expected a little argument."
Homer,"Geez. I mean, I'm no Luis Guzman, but I'm all right."
Homer,Um... remember that Corvette I had?
Homer,This is the worst pain imaginable!
Homer,"Exactly. Well, we're all set. Let's make a Thad Supersperm Junior. With a name like that, he could be president."
Homer,But I was really looking forward to...
Homer,"You're right, Marge. I don't wanna bring more kids into a world full of my kids."
Homer,"Two adults, please."
Homer,Another thing that would be harder with four kids.
Homer,Pushy sign! Don't tell me what to try!
Homer,I don't recall that.
Homer,"One onion rings, please."
Homer,This one's cold.
Homer,"My burns have affected our... intimacy... because all night, I talk about how much money I'm going to make from the lawsuit."
Homer,Oh God! It hurts worse than the burns!
Homer,"Well, thought bubble Marge said we should put it in a college fund for Lisa."
Homer,"I put it in the bank. That place is great! On their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up."
Homer,"Wait, the frog in the trench coat is Kermit too?"
Homer,That settles it. No banks for me.
Homer,What the--? I'm not gonna gamble with my daughter's future.
Homer,"A poker site is now safer than an American bank. Has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?"
Homer,"Open file, click and...invested! Hey Lisa, check out your college fund!"
Homer,"It's a classy operation. See, the little dealer's wearing a bowtie. Cute."
Homer,On a poker site!
Homer,On a poker site!
Homer,Sorry. Check out my new t-shirt.
Homer,"I've had it for a long time. I was just about to throw it out, and then this happened."
Homer,That's one way to avoid drunk driving.
Homer,I'm not Superman.
Homer,"Ha, of course I do! Happy anni... birth... entine... shark week?"
Homer,"What the?! Stupid calendar. First you put the Fourth of July on Sunday, and now this! Ooh, we're gonna discuss this later!"
Homer,"Okay, remember the plan. Apologize to Grampa. Then when he wants us to take him out to lunch, point to the leftovers, tell him we already did, but he forgot."
Homer,"Marge, you take that back!"
Homer,You take that back!
Homer,We're here to see Abe Simpson.
Homer,Missing?! What kind of a prison are you people running here?
Homer,"Oh, it's hopeless! This room is like a museum of meaningless old crap. By which I mean every museum."
Homer,So precious...
Homer,"Look at that, a man's whole life being kicked around on the floor."
Homer,"Flimsy lead, take me away!"
Homer,"Excuse me, have you seen this man?"
Homer,"I'm just trying to get information -- like a nosey reporter, or an undercover cop..."
Homer,"Or a spy from a rival gang! Hey, what are you doin'?"
Homer,Did you say my dad worked here?
Homer,Wait a minute!
Homer,My dad was an aspiring songwriter like Charles Manson? I never knew that.
Homer,"Now, what was that singer's name again?"
Homer,Rita La-what?
Homer,One more time.
Homer,Thank you Mr. Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
Homer,That's where we live!
Homer,Woo hoo! I get two Christmases!
Homer,I can't believe my Dad never told me he had another wife. The man I looked up to my whole life.
Homer,"Well, it's a good thing I didn't because I'd be pretty devastated right now."
Homer,"But we need to know everything, no matter how shameful. And fast!"
Homer,Well just what attracted you to my father?
Homer,I was alive when my Dad knew you?
Homer,My Dad had furniture?! I don't know him at all!
Homer,"Hey, I'm startin' to remember why I don't remember so much."
Homer,"Oh my God. I never knew the sacrifices my father made. Move over, Fonzie. I've got a new hero."
Homer,Holy moly.
Homer,That's Dad's cologne? I always thought it was his old-man stink.
Homer,"Man, you're making me hot for my Dad."
Homer,"Listen, do you know this man?"
Homer,Dad!
Homer,"Dad, promise me you'll never wander off and make us explore your fascinating past again."
Homer,What?!
Homer,"And I don't think you're boring. It's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. Look at Sunday night. There's like eight amazing shows. None of them on Fox."
Homer,Aww.
Homer,I'm payin' for 'em.
Homer,That's how wolves die in the wild.
Homer,The day my Frisbee landed in your yard was the luckiest day of my life...
Homer,He's a good boy.
Homer,What I wouldn't give for an anvil to fall on me.
Homer,A perfect storm?
Homer,"When I prayed for this concert to be over, I didn't mean like this!"
Homer,"I am turning my back, because I can't stand to look you in the face."
Homer,Bart! This is America. Anyone can eat what they want as long as they eat too much.
Homer,"Come on buddy, why would you want to be a murderer?"
Homer,Hi... Dan.
Homer,Doodie.
Homer,Oh?
Homer,Oh my God! You want me to help you escape?
Homer,You wha?
Homer,In my business I try not be seen. I'm scary good at it.
Homer,Please stop. I just wanted my Frisbee back from your yard.
Homer,This is how I get out of doing the dishes.
Homer,"Okay, I don't, I don't know why I said it... I was scared... I needed a response... it was a perfect storm!"
Homer,My Dad used to tie me up when the ice cream truck went by. And now there's no amount of ice cream that'll make me feel full. So this should work!
Homer,Could you please not sound like you like it so much?
Homer,"Now stay down here and I'll be back every hour with food, and every six hours with food for you."
Homer,Classic.
Homer,Someone must be watching on another TV.
Homer,Will you stop saying things that'll make me have to do something?
Homer,"That was four screams! Stupid A.F.I. Boy, never go into their Director's Training Program!"
Homer,Now how would you qualify for that?
Homer,Have fun getting coffee for Roy Disney the Third.
Homer,Dinner time! I know you're hungry! I can hear you rubbing your legs together! Oh my God!
Homer,I never thought Homer Simpson would be a part of the Day of the Locust.
Homer,Are you gonna shoot me in the back of the head?
Homer,I'll fix that later!
Homer,On vacation he digs wells in Darfur!
Homer,Stop!
Homer,Dan!
Homer,You really should tweet less.
Homer,Huh? What?
Homer,"Just listen. If you kill those guys, you'll be as bad as they are."
Homer,"Look, just give me the gun before you hurt somebody. Give it to me!"
Homer,I knew you were weak.
Homer,"You are weak, but no."
Homer,"No, I don't want to."
Homer,I don't want to see it!
Homer,"You're making me mad and I want, I want to shoot you now! / I don't have to see it."
Homer,Give it to me! / I can imagine it. / Give me the gun! /
Homer,"Come on weakling, get it from me."
Homer,"Yeah, well, yeah, well see who's got it now."
Homer,"Well, you ain't so--"
Homer,"Marge, in a crisis like this, I need time for quiet contemplation."
Homer,"I'm in an abusive relationship with life. It keeps beating the hell out of me, and I'm too cowardly to leave it. Maybe I could drink myself to death."
Homer,"Life is too fragile. One minute you're lying in your hammock drinkin' beer, the next thing you know you're sittin' here drinkin' beer."
Homer,"Aw, come on Chief, I've had a rotten day. Can't you help me out?"
Homer,Now what?
Homer,Can this day get any worse?
Homer,Dogs can't get mumps.
Homer,"Aw, that's Tooth Fairy money down the drain, sweetie. I never win anything. It's always some stupid jerk you've never heard of."
Homer,Here it comes...
Homer,"Get him! I mean, woo hoo!"
Homer,"I just want to say, I was having the worst day of my life."
Homer,"Okay, what else... Free Tibet! You heard me! Free him now! Thank you. Oh, my luck has changed!"
Homer,I left a half-eaten apple outside your store... the greatest tribute of all.
Homer,I don't wanna.
Homer,I submit! I submit!
Homer,Oh yeah!
Homer,"You can look at it this way...or this way...whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like ""Tapped Out."""
Homer,Virtual Stapler!
Homer,"Sounds just like a stapler, and it never runs out... unless you tell it to. Here's one that gives ya a cool '70s moustache."
Homer,I'm Sonny Bono. Watch out for that tree!
Homer,"So, which do you prefer, m'lady? Tom Selleck, Rollie Fingers or Pringles Man?"
Homer,But I'm not alone. I'm doing some Face Time with Lenny.
Homer,The old stupid moustache'll win him over.
Homer,I'm really stupid.
Homer,I'm standing by that.
Homer,"Sorry, boss."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Will you kids pipe down! I'm trying to get ""Churro-Chaser"" to tell me where the freshest churros are. What country is Mexico in?"
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Aww. That'll be my screensaver.
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"A paper-based read-a-majig? What are we, cavemen?"
Homer,"Sweetie, in the future all you'll need is this."
Homer,What would you have me do? One basket for each egg?
Homer,"Now, Maggie let's find a good game for us. Hm, ""Krusty's Kosher Karnival""...""Words With Enemies""...""Don't Burn the Toast!"", ""Lenny Dykstra's Prison Break,"" ooh, ""Pizza Clock""!"
Homer,"Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping! Having fun, Maggie?"
Homer,How long have I been playing?
Homer,"Dough, sauce, cheese, topping."
Homer,"Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping."
Homer,"Dohhh! Sauce, cheese, topping!"
Homer,Flushy! Go get help!
Homer,It still had eighty-eight percent of its charge!
Homer,Which of you is the YouTube of the kid high on dentist's gas? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
Homer,"Oh Lord, when things looked darkest, you gave me light. Then you switched it off knowing full well I had declined thy infernal Mapple Care. Please grant me the wisdom to understand your capricious, nasty mind. And please, please make the next swing of the yo-yo an up, amen."
Homer,Everybody hear that?
Homer,"Keep your pants on, Flanders."
Homer,Has the MyPad risen?
Homer,"This is your miracle? A tree? Ooh, look at me. I turn sunlight into complex sugars. Big whoop."
Homer,"Huh. ""Hope."" Is this one of those coincidences like Jesus on a tortilla or George Washington on a dollar bill?"
Homer,"Well, this is how God would send me a message. In my back yard, hammock adjacent, in one short word in large print. What do you think he's trying to tell me, Flanders?"
Homer,Fine. I'll just go eat the body of God. That's not crazy.
Homer,"Moe, I could believe this was a random occurrence, or I could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. I'm choosin' hope! Moe, a bottle of your finest beer!"
Homer,To hope!
Homer,"Uh, excuse me, Reverend, but I'm here to talk about something a little more important: hope."
Homer,"Hope is here, people, and it's real. It's not just inside the house of God, it's outside the house of me! So come and see the sticky brown truth!"
Homer,Hope is all around me!
Homer,As promised: the miracle!
Homer,I don't know what to believe anymore. Maybe it's time to call Satan. Is that a two-one-two?
Homer,"Marge, up to now I thought your hair was blue cotton candy, but now I know it's a solid loaf of brain."
Homer,Who do you think painted the word on the tree?
Homer,Guess it must've been the person who knew I needed hope most of all.
Homer,"Bart, stop it! You might fall!"
Homer,Grampa?!
Homer,"This boy's grandfather is a shriveled-up corn cob, begging for death! I am his father... I can't believe I allowed you to hit on me."
Homer,"Beat it, ducks! I'm not old enough to have food for you! I'm sexy! Young and sexy!"
Homer,Old man... I'm not an old man... This drawing doesn't think I'm old.
Homer,"Don't you, drawing?"
Homer,Those aren't our regular donuts! They're huge... with crazy toppings! Gummy worms! Churro chunks! Russian nesting donut!
Homer,Gotta eat the rest!
Homer,They're gone!
Homer,"Where did these ""Devil Donuts"" come from?"
Homer,"Get lost, pervs!"
Homer,"Okay, where did you get these donuts?"
Homer,I'm calling to report... a missing donut cart.
Homer,"No, no, nothing, nope."
Homer,I see... devil horns!
Homer,"... pitchfork, pointed tail... hooves are... cloven! We have logo, people. We have logo!"
Homer,No more donuts?
Homer,Beer keg do-nut?
Homer,I would be honored to shake the hand that glazed this.
Homer,Tell me everything about you.
Homer,You're from Portland? I've heard of people being from there.
Homer,"Wait a minute, you have kids?! You can't have kids! Look at you!"
Homer,"You have a fun job, a skull ring and it's not Halloween... and your belt is a seatbelt..."
Homer,No one would ever think you're a lame old man.
Homer,Our houses are the cheapest! The one next to me's been on sale forever! I see them lowering the price every morning when I go out to pee.
Homer,Please. Please rush into this! Please rush into this!
Homer,"In my house, we found human bones."
Homer,"Really? I'm... ...cool? Oh, can I man-hug you?"
Homer,I don't know how.
Homer,"Okay, our first hang-out with the cool new neighbors. I've already ""blown them away"" -- their words, I assume -- so don't screw it up."
Homer,"Great, Marge, now that's in their heads."
Homer,"""Star Wars"" Chewy's just a man in a costume, so he's not scary."
Homer,"""T-Rex?"" Even their names are cool! This is, umm... Ice Cream, Bungee Jump, and... Viral Video."
Homer,Check out my new look!
Homer,Terence shaved my head!
Homer,"No, I'm young person ""cool"" bald, not old person ""sad"" bald. I never want to see these again."
Homer,"Check it out, Flanders, us cool dads are sharing a mono-yard. Guess I can't be your best friend anymore."
Homer,"Boo hoo hoo, you can cry all night. It's not gonna win me back."
Homer,"I have a plan to deal with that. Step one: change everything about ourselves until we are super cool, the end."
Homer,"Honey, I'm not cool. I was never cool. I didn't go to college. Every CD I have I bought at a carwash. Black-and-white films make me angry. I can't pronounce ""artis-anal."" I only know David Cross from the Chipmunks movie. Not only do I like Van Halen, but I think they keep getting better..."
Homer,"But if me and my kids do the same stuff as Terence and his kids, I could be a cool dad."
Homer,"Thanks, baby. Here, have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip."
Homer,"No, we need to take kids to grownup stuff. That's Terence's parenting style--"
Homer,"Well, you won't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches."
Homer,Wearing scarves in non-scarf weather is the essence of cool. The. Essence.
Homer,"Oh man, my goatee has barely come in. Why does my hair only grow in twos?"
Homer,I hope T-Rex likes the present I made him.
Homer,"Homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are. If I show up with a ""toy"" from the ""store,"" like we would give ""our kids,"" then I've failed! And these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing!"
Homer,T-Rex loves decaying industrial-scapes.
Homer,I thought it made blimp tires!
Homer,Are we still on for midnight bike riding?
Homer,"Oh ohhhh boy, oh oh oh oh boy, oh boy."
Homer,"O-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... We had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up."
Homer,He called me... a poser?
Homer,You? Sticking up for your old man? You've never done that before.
Homer,What? No one judges my wife's thunderbags! Well maybe I was wrong about these people. Who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?
Homer,They can goatee... hell!
Homer,"Yeah, that's right, the friendship between the Simpsons and the whatever-your-last-name-is-es-es is over!"
Homer,Fine. Keep 'em. But you have to give back... Lisa?!
Homer,Could we at least agree to both hate Flanders?
Homer,Shut up with your names!
Homer,"Parenting? Let me tell you ""cool parents"" something. Parents are supposed to be lame... so their kids have something to rebel against... by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame! It's nature's way!"
Homer,"Even Flanders agrees! This is our neighborhood. We were here first, so you should leave."
Homer,"Oh no, it's true!"
Homer,"Stupid town... at least I've still got Moe's... although probably not, seeing where this is going..."
Homer,What happened here?
Homer,"Oh, Marge, it's bad."
Homer,I brought these people to Springfield... and now they've taken over!
Homer,It's a hellhole!
Homer,What happened to our town? Everybody wears clothes from the past and uses computers from the future!
Homer,"Okay, you win. We don't have to be friends, but can we live on the fringes of your world? Like those eels that eat whale poop?"
Homer,"Your organic, all-natural lifestyle has doomed us all!"
Homer,They're necessary! They're necessary!
Homer,They're finally necessary!
Homer,I did it! I did it! I man-hugged!
Homer,"Well, I can't pick up something this heavy without my lifting belt."
Homer,Oh no! I won't be able to help you pack up Grampa!
Homer,Hold down the fort?! With my bad back?!
Homer,"Man, that keyboard playing cat is so cute."
Homer,Villageville. Build your own authentic medieval village. I must have something better to do.
Homer,And ca-lick!
Homer,"Finally, a woodcutter that will do what I tell him."
Homer,Holy moley! He's already made a clearing! Let's go for a glade!
Homer,Just call me DeForest Kelley. I gotta write that down and send it to Conan.
Homer,Move this here. Tap. Mill! Mill! Barn! Silo! Tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern! Brothel. Parsonage! Theater In The Round! And... hay pile...
Homer,"And the Lord saw what he had made, and it was good."
Homer,"That's right, your Lord sticks his hand in his pants. And yes, it is the same hand I tapped you with."
Homer,"Well, if I've learned anything, it's that you can't have too much iron ore."
Homer,You're back!
Homer,It's real to them!
Homer,I don't know -- the back yard?
Homer,Oh my God. I forgot to feed my jackass!
Homer,You're hel-come!
Homer,"Oh, right."
Homer,A lot of good backups. How pregnant is the raccoon?
Homer,"Good, Marge. Get their price down."
Homer,Not a crier.
Homer,Goofing on it made me feel wise!
Homer,"Prep, prep, prep..."
Homer,I believe the word is idiote.
Homer,I know what must have happened:
Homer,I'm gonna get a snack. But first... should I introduce the black plague? What could be the harm?
Homer,"Whoa, now I've gotta buy a corpse wagon. That's how they getcha."
Homer,It's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese.
Homer,"Oh yeah, baby, I'm drinking you down to your knees."
Homer,GONNA DRINK AMMONIA / 'CAUSE IT TASTES LIKE CHEESE / WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN...
Homer,"A minstrel has composed a roundelay mocking me?! Torture, torture, torture!"
Homer,He knows I love him. And he loves me.
Homer,"That's short for ""Rrright you are!"""
Homer,How are they his treats if I paid for them?
Homer,"Okay, okay. I'll be nicer to the dude. I've just never really been a dog person."
Homer,Bongo?! I told you never to ever talk about Bongo!
Homer,Ever!
Homer,He's still my dog!
Homer,"I don't know what you just said, but it's wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong!"
Homer,It doesn't make sense to me!
Homer,I happen to remember it just a little differently.
Homer,"Now granted, I was just a kid, but I say..."
Homer,Everything's a flavor in the kitchens of today!
Homer,Grampa always hated Bongo and loved money so he sold Bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped Santa so I'd never get the toy I actually wanted--
Homer,"And then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the Santa part."
Homer,"Wait. Wait. There's one part of the story even Grampa didn't know about: a few months later, I went to rescue Bongo..."
Homer,"But, there was one thing I wasn't prepared for..."
Homer,Bongo was happy. Without me. He had become her dog.
Homer,"Well, that's just the way dogs are. The most disloyal unfaithful creatures God ever made."
Homer,He still has my sweatshirt.
Homer,"Oh my God, Dad... I owe you an apology. You saved Bongo. I never understood that till now."
Homer,"Why would you think that, just because I put you in a home where they feed you dog food?"
Homer,"Okay, but I'm a little out of practice."
Homer,What flavor?
Homer,"If it doesn't matter, then I call Snickers."
Homer,My dog.
Homer,"Yeah, Mom, you promised!"
Homer,"Sorry, Mrs. Simpson."
Homer,Is this a kid you'd pay ransom for?
Homer,Feed it to the dog.
Homer,Don't you tell me how to feed you to the dog!
Homer,Can't I keep an eye on that kid? He's fabulous.
Homer,It's always my kids.
Homer,Where'd they go?
Homer,Almost... holy moley...
Homer,"What the--? Ooh, it's hopeless."
Homer,Who the hell are you?
Homer,Absolutely not! My adult frame is simply too large. No! Never! Fine! Here I come!
Homer,Crawling... so painful...
Homer,...duck walk... infinitely worse...
Homer,"Sh, sh. Shhhhh. Soon you'll know peace."
Homer,"I made it, kids! I am king of Learning-ton Castle!"
Homer,Real matuuure!
Homer,What cool kid thing's in here?
Homer,Never!
Homer,Butter.
Homer,"Apes... deep down we're all savage apes. Leave your body, Homer."
Homer,What the hell was that?
Homer,"Well, I've taken eight months off. It's time to get back on the horse."
Homer,"I guess despite all our so-called civilization, anarchy lurks around every corner, like a racially-diverse street gang on a network cop show."
Homer,America can't collapse! We're as powerful as ancient Rome!
Homer,Sweet.
Homer,"Oh my God! This unsourced, undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt!"
Homer,"Preppies? Oh, I hate you guys! Always partying on deck with your Docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge!"
Homer,It's based on nothing!
Homer,"I'd slash my wrists! But how, without my electric knife?!"
Homer,I can't conceive of any.
Homer,Don't worry. I am very good at keeping secrets.
Homer,Impending doom...
Homer,"Honey, everything's fine. There's nothing to worry about."
Homer,Just go play your saxophone while you can.
Homer,Secrets? I have no secrets! Just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of. Smell some bread!
Homer,Typical sheeple.
Homer,Maybe.
Homer,"Yeah, but I'll go home, weigh myself, and I'll have gained six pounds. What's that about?"
Homer,I guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place.
Homer,"I wish. Son, the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies."
Homer,"So, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?"
Homer,"Hollywood has taught you well, my son. Now let's push ""play."""
Homer,Fridge-ra-torr!
Homer,Do not question the wisdom of Tom Skerritt.
Homer,Wow. Your end of the world is better than my during the world.
Homer,"Aw. Uh, listen, I've gotta know. You're not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat?"
Homer,It's okay. I know what I am.
Homer,Um... a lot of that stuff must've got lost in the move.
Homer,I want to tell you but I promised to keep it a secret.
Homer,It's very late in the marriage to tell me that.
Homer,I've hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall.
Homer,See? These are our bug-out bags. In here is everything we need to survive.
Homer,The looming kablooey.
Homer,"Creepy? Marge, the apocalypse is coming. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming... and soon."
Homer,There's no handle on this side!
Homer,The one thing I couldn't prepare for.
Homer,"Marge, this is it! TEOTWAWKI!"
Homer,"Uh-huh, where's the kids?"
Homer,"Boy, get in the car. And say goodbye to your best friend forever."
Homer,This is my daughter. She brings the gift of music to the new world.
Homer,Baritone.
Homer,Here's something to pass the endless time. Write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations.
Homer,Society will not have to start from square one.
Homer,"Marge, when I started prepping for the end of the world, everyone laughed at me."
Homer,"Well, just because I imagined it doesn't make it any less true. And now all those people are on their own."
Homer,If Jesus had a gun he'd be alive today.
Homer,Why do we have to shoot them at all?
Homer,No! I want to help the people who didn't prepare!
Homer,"Don't be silly, ""Mary Ellen."""
Homer,"Now we're going to leave this place. I'm sorry, Bart -- I know you've made a bug-out camp girlfriend..."
Homer,White rice or brown?
Homer,So we'll take these supplies back to Springfield where they're needed most.
Homer,Hm. I cut the wires to something.
Homer,"Okay, everybody, keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something. If we miss it, we're dead."
Homer,How can that be? I took every last can of gas!
Homer,"Now, everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall."
Homer,"Out of our way, corn! The starving people of Springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes, and flash frozen corn nibblets."
Homer,"Now to save these sorry souls from a life of anarchy, starvation, and having sex for procreation."
Homer,"You got to watch a VHS copy of ""Red Dawn"" thirteen times. Stop complaining."
Homer,"We can keep the shrimp de-veiner though, right?"
Homer,"Good riddance. When I found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, I really lost interest."
Homer,"Goodbye, my electrical friends. I can't afford to use you, so I'm doing what any good American would do -- throw you away."
Homer,Parking meter?!
Homer,And it still works!
Homer,"This could come in handy. But let me check that list of things Marge said never to bring home. Dogs, cats, octopuses, octopi, octopuseseses..."
Homer,"Parking meter, you're workin' for me now."
Homer,Lotta people at the dump today.
Homer,"This is the easiest money I've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!"
Homer,It's not that kind!
Homer,"All right, now to drag the meter to the next idiot."
Homer,"Oh God, my back! Suckers! My discs are grinding! Easy money!"
Homer,"We're cool, right boy?"
Homer,Now to sleep the sleep of the just.
Homer,I'm king of the bus station!
Homer,"Eat silver, copper!"
Homer,"Stay with me, man. Stay with me."
Homer,"No, no! You're the first successful business I've ever run!"
Homer,"The pillows are safe at my workstation. As for the quarters... well, I'm ashamed to tell you what I did."
Homer,How long have you been in there?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,...and I wish that Mr. Teeny gets a banana ... that the Isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel ... I wish that wishing wells worked so I wasn't just tossing my money away ... and that Marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things I do ...
Homer,"Way to get us back on topic, Marge."
Homer,You live like this?
Homer,"Dear Lord, if thy tornado must take me, please let it take me to Oz, but don't let Flanders be the Scarecrow!"
Homer,"We made it, boy!"
Homer,Oh my God. Oh my God. This counts as a walk!
Homer,The tornado took old what's-his-name! I'm going after him!
Homer,"Lenny, take us with you to find our dog! It's okay, Marge, they're professionals."
Homer,Hey!
Homer,Maybe the last words I'll ever write.
Homer,"Maybe! Look, you guys obviously know about weather, but I understand something much more predictable: women."
Homer,What women really want is a guy who's confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know she'll still love him.
Homer,That is the stupidest...
Homer,I would never do that.
Homer,Fine. But I swear: I will win you back from Lenny.
Homer,"Help me, God! What is it I'm paying you for every Sunday?"
Homer,Can always use... a good babysitter.
Homer,He was a black guy but his voice sounded like a white guy.
Homer,"Yes, it won't give!"
Homer,Found another one.
Homer,"Were you worried about me, boy?"
Homer,Clearly the boy's in shock.
Homer,Stop being blasé!
Homer,"Now I know you kids are scared by what happened, but it's bedtime. Just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes."
Homer,Connecticut?
Homer,"Okay, you're right. It's hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids, but I think the choice is obvious -- my dad."
Homer,Good point. We'll find somebody else.
Homer,"I got it, Dad."
Homer,"Oh yeah? The tornado was more of a father to me than you! Okay, how about my brother? He's rich."
Homer,"Oh, how very kind of you. I am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags! One lump, please."
Homer,That's some impressive flute-nastics.
Homer,Goodbye forever!
Homer,"All right, Marge. Maybe we're being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with. We'll take what we can get."
Homer,"Kids, there's nothing to worry about...but we're looking at replacements for your Mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family."
Homer,This is not that! And that smart-alecky attitude is exactly why no one wants you!
Homer,"Okay, I'll nudge 'em with the car. We'll get a whole ""meet cute"" thing going."
Homer,Wait! What about that couple? They look pretty cozy.
Homer,"Wowww. Your house is perfect. No sharp corners, no unsafe balconies, a cool Grampa..."
Homer,"Ooh, Thanks, Dad."
Homer,"Wow. I assumed The Jackson Five were the only perfect family, but now I see there's another."
Homer,"Uh, say, listen, Portia. How would you and Mav feel about... um, swinging?"
Homer,"No, no, no. I meant pushing kids on swings."
Homer,"Okay, take whatever time you need. I just want to know if you'd like to be their guardians."
Homer,"Man, you sure can talk surfer talk."
Homer,Maybe this'll help you make up your mind.
Homer,You never know when you might wanna mail something.
Homer,Worrywart Marge. You don't look a Trojan Horse in the mouth.
Homer,"I swear to you, Marge, when I have the time, I will Google them both."
Homer,"Oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here, but I'm gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you can't really understand what I'm saying..."
Homer,Great. And now my Dad can notarize.
Homer,Name another.
Homer,Now I can finally complete my bucket list.
Homer,"Too late! You already signed! Oh wait, there's one more."
Homer,"Suckers!!! Oh wait, you've gotta initial this."
Homer,Check mate.
Homer,"Hey, if they can watch 'em for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend."
Homer,"Marge, no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit."
Homer,It helps me write.
Homer,"Marge, this has been great couples time. The one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids!"
Homer,I don't like the way they just rip the paper off. Santa's Little Helper my ass.
Homer,No one steals my kids... except me... from that theme park jail... that I never told you about... except I guess I just did... we're all caught up now... let's go!
Homer,"Like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young."
Homer,"Oh yeah, man."
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. We'll get 'em. Unless we die on this icy mountain road. Then they've won forever."
Homer,Women and their horrible thoughts.
Homer,"Marge, let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids. But those kids are ours, because we made them, by accident. And now, we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them."
Homer,"I've got a bone to pick with you! Then, an apology to make. Then, we exchange insurance information. Then, more bone picking!"
Homer,Those better be good breaks.
Homer,"Sure you wanted the fun parts, but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals?"
Homer,"Well, I'm glad someone has."
Homer,We've won. Woo hoo.
Homer,"Instead of concentrating on dying, we're going to concentrate on living."
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,I do call this living! Living the way kids in India can only dream of!
Homer,I win!
Homer,I forget.
Homer,"Ladies, please! You can boss me around, just one at a time!"
Homer,What the?
Homer,Finally! A supervisor!
Homer,Thank God I wore the underwear with the hole on the side.
Homer,"If you're lucky, me, then this."
Homer,"Listen to your sister, boy."
Homer,What are you talkin' about? Marge and I are goin' great.
Homer,It was during Happy Hour. Don't you want our baby to be happy?
Homer,How can something that applies to Bart apply to me? I'm so much older and wiser.
Homer,Why you little... I'll teach you to say something that sounds similar!
Homer,You told me it was up to me if I wanted to go!
Homer,I am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!
Homer,"Finally, we're gettin' somewhere."
Homer,"Hand me my suitcase, boy."
Homer,When you're older.
Homer,"You're saying it like it happens all the time. And by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot. You call this a Platinum Club experience?"
Homer,"I've told you a thousand times, call me Homer!"
Homer,Standard hotel boilerplate. It just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.
Homer,"Oh, it'll happen again, son."
Homer,Knock yourself out.
Homer,Not again!
Homer,I had this idea years ago...but your mother wouldn't let me do it.
Homer,Shows how much she... knooooows! It's hurting my eyes!
Homer,"You know what we need? A classic ""kicked outta the house"" party. Now who's got a rockin' CD?"
Homer,"That's it? Well, then let's ""power"" this party up!"
Homer,This calls for decisive action -- like L.B.J.'s use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the Civil Rights Act.
Homer,"The same way Hollywood does, by watching British movies!"
Homer,"Agreed, but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture."
Homer,After we finish watching the movie.
Homer,I WROTE THIS SONG TO SAY I'M SORRY
Homer,THE MELODY IS BY BEETHOVEN
Homer,MARGE YOU WILL GET THE LAST PORK CHOP...
Homer,And I promise to do the things I checked off within a year.
Homer,I think it's a Terence Malick movie.
Homer,"Finally, a kids' show that isn't trying to sell you something. Which reminds me, we need to order more rectangles."
Homer,"Honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like prohibition, it will end in a hail of bullets."
Homer,I'm on it.
Homer,"If I buy you, why do I need all these books?"
Homer,Spot the Hidden Objects.
Homer,"Boy, you're pretty pushy for a book I just met."
Homer,"Gotcha! Candy cane in the umbrella stand -- oldest trick in the book... okay, let's see..."
Homer,"If they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then ""no."""
Homer,"Okay, now to see if I can apply my book knowledge to the real world."
Homer,Got 'em!
Homer,"Sure, what do I care?"
Homer,"Whatever you say, sir."
Homer,Sometimes it's just so nice to have a man take charge.
Homer,Grownups have their reasons!
Homer,But I just did that!
Homer,"Marge, can I get a subscription to Highlights Magazine?"
Homer,Where does it say that?
Homer,"Highlights... ""for..."""
Homer,Leave it to me...
Homer,Earring!
Homer,...thimble from Monopoly game...
Homer,...twenty-five dollar casino chip...
Homer,...the smallest nesting doll!
Homer,Just my honey pie.
Homer,Wanna split it while we snuggle?
Homer,Licking the wrapper.
Homer,Waldo. Waldo. Waldo.
Homer,We'll get those kids back.
Homer,Because we just bought them new shoes!
Homer,Waldo. Waldo.
Homer,How many kids will jazz corrupt?
Homer,No. I'm sorry. It's... wait a minute.
Homer,We've found what we're looking for.
Homer,"Sure, they could be here. Who knows?"
Homer,Your hair is growing back! Tell me your secret!
Homer,There's always a catch.
Homer,"It's gonna be ""yes,"" but don't rush me."
Homer,"Son, promise you will never look like me."
Homer,Why you little! That's not a heartwarming thing to end on!
Homer,I can't believe you're reading when there's so much great stuff on TV.
Homer,"Writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of DUI's. The only reason TV exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human, made-up jobs."
Homer,Ooo! Jail music!
Homer,I'll give it one marathon.
Homer,"No one feels out a unit like CJ! Not Bubba, not Debbie and Danny, no one!"
Homer,"High-five me, Marge!"
Homer,Too late!
Homer,We're gonna get rich off the poor and forgetful! And dead people.
Homer,"There's other P.O.s? Uh-oh, better put on my game shades."
Homer,One thousand dollars!
Homer,"In the money game, cash is king."
Homer,You won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures.
Homer,Feather boas?
Homer,Tights? Robes? This stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady.
Homer,Why would my man-dad have lady stuff?
Homer,Beefcake mags?
Homer,That's insane! My dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. My gay dad is gay for gays.
Homer,Those are pretty cute...
Homer,"My dad's always been so angry. Maybe if we help him be who he is, he'll finally be happy."
Homer,"Yeah. Gay rights are human rights, baby."
Homer,"It's okay, Dad. We know the truth, and we love you."
Homer,"Just admit who you are, and you can find new love."
Homer,No fatties!
Homer,Fine.
Homer,"If I can't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle, then I've failed as a son."
Homer,Then how do you explain this?
Homer,Who?
Homer,Look at all this wrestling stuff.
Homer,What's wrong?
Homer,"You were a world-famous wrestler? Spill the beans, old man. Word beans!"
Homer,Those things?
Homer,I don't know. Should I really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future?
Homer,Text me the choices.
Homer,"Apparently, old folks homes are full of people that used to be things. Just like you and me. Swear to God."
Homer,Fine.
Homer,"Heel? Oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like Grampa!"
Homer,No I don't. If you pray to Superman.
Homer,"Your grandfather is super lame! I mean, if he wasn't a terrible father, what's my excuse for this?"
Homer,"You grandson-ruining fiend! Look what your ""number one fan"" did at show and tell!"
Homer,It's found footage!
Homer,How are you a winner? You're cheating in a fake sport!
Homer,"Bart cannot be an old-time wrestler! As your inattentive son, and your incompetent employee, I forbid it!"
Homer,Why does everything I forbid always happen?
Homer,"He's taking on Mean Man Monty! Go get him, Honest Abe!"
Homer,I wish Grampa was my dad.
Homer,Hey Flanders. Can I borrow some sugar?
Homer,A little cream?
Homer,"Now if you could make with some bacon and eggs, I'll be on my way."
Homer,Are your kids gonna be there?
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Hello, police? I'd like to report a buzz-kill in progress."
Homer,This room just got a whole lot cooler.
Homer,Look at the size of that bird! I'd go Henry the Eighth on those drumsticks.
Homer,"Yeah, it's medicinal. We had a pain in our neck."
Homer,I didn't know you were left-handed.
Homer,But the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology.
Homer,What about Christian Archie comics?
Homer,"Here, I'll get you started. Hail Superman, wearing tights, Clark Kent be thy name... one nation, under Zod..."
Homer,"Give him one of your famous murmurs, Marge."
Homer,Your famous murmur. You know .
Homer,"Thanks, Flanders. Punch my eye, destroy my marriage. Now just pull the plug and let me die."
Homer,"I hate unions. There's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job."
Homer,"Oh yeah. I say ""union"" you say ""power""! Union..."
Homer,Union!
Homer,"Marge, you're really dogging it on the ""power."" But don't worry, because of the union, you're safe. So, just what are you gonna do for our daughter?"
Homer,We really appreciate that.
Homer,Flanders?! How'd you get in here? This place is a highly-sensitive area.
Homer,"Hey, I don't go to where you work and read the bible to you!"
Homer,Just what do you want?!
Homer,"So, you went and hired a law firm, eh? That's pretty aggressive."
Homer,"C'mon, man. What's the catch?"
Homer,Hmm...
Homer,"I'm not punching you, Flanders."
Homer,"Because if I hit you back, we'll be even. But if I don't hit you, that makes me the better man. And I'm liking the way that feels."
Homer,"It's not for me to judge, Ned because... I am the better man!"
Homer,"Better man, comin' through... way-better-better, way-better-better zing!"
Homer,"You may be the sweater man, but Homer is the better man."
Homer,I didn't know you were left-handed.
Homer,"Fear not, people. I will lead you safely across."
Homer,"Help me, Flanders!"
Homer,"What's wrong, Sweetie?"
Homer,Even after we came to school?
Homer,Every time I try to fix things it just makes things worse. But I'm gonna fix this!
Homer,I think I have an idea.
Homer,"Flanders, I've come to forgive you."
Homer,"But, there is one condition..."
Homer,Don't wanna hit you. I want your wife.
Homer,"To elaborate, I want your wife, the teacher, to help get rid of Lisa's substitute..."
Homer,"How much plutonium do you want? Gotta warn you, it might take me twenty minutes to get it."
Homer,This is praying?! Let me outta here!
Homer,Help me God!
Homer,I don't like the sound of that funeral march.
Homer,"Okay! I'll pay for your damn band candy! What was it, seventeen hundred dollars?"
Homer,Now do me wearing a sombrero!
Homer,Now have me sleeping under a cactus!
Homer,All too well.
Homer,"Son, if there's one thing I've learned as a defendant, and a juror, it's... stay out of the courtroom! It's so frickin' boring! Run, boy! I'll create a distraction!"
Homer,You gotta be kiddin'.
Homer,It's amazing how much exercise I've gotten from those words.
Homer,"Keep it under your hat, guys, but I've got a date with a married woman."
Homer,Her husband's gonna be there too.
Homer,Give up? It's Marge -- I'm having a lunch date with my wife.
Homer,Date with my wife.
Homer,When we got married I promised you a life full of romance. Now here it is.
Homer,"Marge, this is amazing. I never realized some restaurants are better than others."
Homer,Oh yeah.
Homer,Beats drowning.
Homer,What? What? You're interesting. Why would you say that?
Homer,"Words hurt, you know."
Homer,"Maybe it's time for a visit from Wally, the Kissing Walrus."
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Marge, I thought this was an innocuous lunch but it's become terribly ocuous."
Homer,"Conversation, conversation... you look great."
Homer,"And uh, how was your day?"
Homer,"You can't spell ""lousy"" without ""us."""
Homer,"Marge, wait!"
Homer,"Listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other."
Homer,"Well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch."
Homer,"Oh my God! A marriage so perfect that I could take it for granted for years, suddenly explodes. What do I do?! What do I do?!"
Homer,I like that picture of the sneaker with wings. I'm gonna flee!
Homer,Where's an electric sidewalk when you need one?
Homer,Fleeing didn't work. I have no choice. I will have to... do whatever the other thing was!!!
Homer,"I'm fightin' for ya, babe. Fighting like I would for the last slice of cold pizza in the box. And to show you how serious I am..."
Homer,From the place beside the gas station!
Homer,Marge was so happy when I made those promises. What changed?
Homer,"How do I win Marge over? I could get her kids to like me! No, that ship has sailed."
Homer,Hm. Would it make a woman happy to do the things she asked you to do?
Homer,I think it would!
Homer,Searchy? Where can I find brake fluid?
Homer,That was yesterday.
Homer,Where can I find a better voice-activated search machine?
Homer,I can't please any woman.
Homer,"Okay, let's see how straight it is."
Homer,What have I told you about comical entrances?
Homer,"I'm planing down that door that always sticks. I put training wheels on Bart's bike, and made an appointment with the dermatologist to see about my slowly-receding hairline."
Homer,"Yes, my love?"
Homer,"Oh. Well, you know how in the Special Olympics they give medals just for showing up?"
Homer,"I'd like a lot of food, and for this to be the last decision I have to make."
Homer,You're all I have left. I trust you completely.
Homer,Okay... this should do it.
Homer,Marriage is so tough. Every second it could explode catastrophically. Makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.
Homer,Omakase? Where have I heard that word before?
Homer,Wow. Wow. This is the most delicious analogy I've ever eaten. I need to share this insight with Marge. Put this in your finest Styrofoam!
Homer,"Once again, by eating alone I have saved my marriage."
Homer,"For reasons I forgot in the car, this sushi represents our marriage. But what I know for sure, is that I want to share it with you."
Homer,"Well, at least you don't have to suffer, boy."
Homer,"Moe, can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with ""f""?"
Homer,Woo hoo! I'll woo her with woo-hoo!
Homer,Hello dere!
Homer,The minister's wife? What are you here for?
Homer,"Listen pal, this may sound kinda kinky, but I would like to, uh, please my wife."
Homer,"I think I could give it a shot what-what, guvnah. Bob's your uncle."
Homer,Oh Marge! Come to the ga-rage! You know it'll be good 'cause I'm saying it in a sing-song fash-ion!
Homer,Just relax. Sit down. Not in that chair! It has no bottom!
Homer,Anger's a mood!
Homer,I don't know. It's just that you always say we should try new things. But I thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle...
Homer,Quick! Call the Procter and Gamble help line!
Homer,What does that mean?
Homer,It's behind the Dingle Swing.
Homer,"So, you forgive me?"
Homer,"Thanks, honey. So you're not cool with any of the toys?"
Homer,Which one?
Homer,What size batteries.
Homer,Ooh! How many?
Homer,Holy moly!
Homer,Really? You wanna throw something out just because it's a little old?
Homer,No need. I already went online and ordered a new couch just like the old one.
Homer,"And you know, Marge, those salespeople weren't really our friends."
Homer,They charged a deposit!
Homer,"That's right, sweetie. It always comes from corporate."
Homer,Ew! Just hearing about them makes me itch.
Homer,"Funny how the brain does that, huh?"
Homer,The brain is so stupid.
Homer,"Probably one of Bart's dirty friends! Boy, why are your friends so dirty?"
Homer,Touché.
Homer,Wait a minute! This has oats in it!
Homer,"Ooh, a nose-hair trimmer!"
Homer,"Padre, can I be honest with you? I've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. But there isn't."
Homer,"And if it's such a ""Good Book,"" how come there's no blurbs on the back? Not even David Sedaris? And he'll flack anything!"
Homer,"Seriously, ""Pews?"""
Homer,Deacon? Is that like one of those weird Catholic Priest things?
Homer,"Oh, now we're talkin'. But why me?"
Homer,"Well I'm not one for taking new jobs on a whim. But as we say in the snow plow business, ""I'm your astronaut""!"
Homer,Just looking for the bathroom.
Homer,But this paper towel feels so good.
Homer,That would save us several hundred bucks.
Homer,"Right, um, I don't understand, Lisa, we let you get up early to watch the Royal Wedding!"
Homer,Since when?
Homer,"It's an honor, sir."
Homer,Lost sheep! Yes! Sis boom bah!
Homer,Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Find out in whose loving memory this week's service is. The answer may shock you.
Homer,"Now, for the record, I hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. I never hated the church itself. And now, finally, I believe in something bigger than myself."
Homer,Why you little...! lamb... mustn't... kill own son... only God can do that...
Homer,Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Church--
Homer,Someone finally took one!
Homer,DAY BY DAY... DAY BY DAY... THE DEACON'S JOB... IS PRETTY OKAY... PRETTY OKAAAY... I'M GOING TO BE A DEACON... DAY BY DAY... I'M ALREADY A DEACON... DAY BY DAY...
Homer,"Son, I'd love to, but... I'm a deacon now. My butt's place is in my pants."
Homer,What the--?
Homer,"Calm yourselves! In times like this, there's one almighty being we can put our faith in... Reverend Hooper."
Homer,His boringness saved us all...
Homer,Compliments of the deacon!
Homer,DAY BY DAY / DAY BY DAY / I'VE GOT THREE KIDS / AND TWO ARE OKAY / TWO ARE OKAY! / ONE OF THEM IS THE BABY / THE SMART ONE IS MINE MAYBE / I HOPE THE BOY GETS RABIES / DAY BY DAY BY DAY / DAY BY DAY... / OH I PRAY / DAY BY DAY BY DAY BY DAAAY!
Homer,Oh boy.
Homer,Is that the radon detector?
Homer,"Marge, you're deleting the two thousand nine Oscar Red Carpet! There were some awesome dresses! And quite a few dis-as-ters."
Homer,"Well, I can't part with a single one of my ""Hoarders""! Hands off my episodes of ""Episodes,"" and if you delete ""Revenge""..."
Homer,...so I stayed up for the last eighty-seven hours watching all my shows.
Homer,Nothin's gonna delete these!
Homer,I know C.P.R.
Homer,I took a class where you do chest compressions to a Bee Gees song.
Homer,HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE... HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE...
Homer,Too on the nose. I REALLY NEED TO LEARN / 'CAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF FOOLS...
Homer,Now wait a minute. Gotta make sure you're okay. Who's the president now?
Homer,He's back!
Homer,The woman I love!
Homer,"Well, uh, I was just leaving, but Moe... had an accident."
Homer,"Okay, Moe, one more surprise."
Homer,"They're like a wedding ring, I can't take them off anymore."
Homer,Got anything for a man my size?
Homer,"Tent, eh?"
Homer,"No tents, no barrels, no kiddy pools. Thank you, fashion police."
Homer,Thank God I'm not in the shower!
Homer,The crows weren't racist -- the people who drew them were.
Homer,Stupid clog...
Homer,My head hairs! I'm bald!
Homer,Get-- Get get in there...
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Aw, dammit!"
Homer,Is it that obvious?
Homer,My wife has never seen my head naked. Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat.
Homer,"Those two hairs were what was left of my youth, Moe."
Homer,"Those royal elephants have trainers to keep 'em in shape. Average schmoe like me, forget it."
Homer,Sausage fingers!
Homer,"Okay guys, here's the deal -- I've gone bald."
Homer,What are you talking about?
Homer,"The way you put it, it sounds so perfect, but it's not."
Homer,It's not even noon.
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,"Are you my guardian angel? If so, can you turn a pumpkin into a chariot? Even a used Camry would be okay."
Homer,You're cool with it? I haven't even told my wife.
Homer,"Wow, is that what your wife did?"
Homer,Which one?
Homer,"Yeah, your generation won't have any dreams come true."
Homer,"Marge, I have something to show you."
Homer,"No, it's something else."
Homer,Well?
Homer,"Hair, no hair, I don't really think about it."
Homer,Tell me about it.
Homer,"Oh Marge, when you hold me like that..."
Homer,To me it's legs versus boobs.
Homer,What the--? Change the channel? But I'm watching soft-core tennis!
Homer,What the hell is that?
Homer,Did she really say that?
Homer,No.
Homer,"You like this now? What about ""Planet Jackson and the Earth Brigade?"""
Homer,"You did it, baby. You promised no fun and you delivered."
Homer,"Guys, this science exhibit that told me how stupid it is to play the lottery."
Homer,Are you nuts? You can't win if you don't play.
Homer,Four lucky numbers for four best friends.
Homer,"And I'm sixty-nine, because people always laugh when you say sixty-nine. No one knows why."
Homer,I'll get mini-dumpsters of wings from Garbage Wings!
Homer,To the best feeling in the world -- money.
Homer,"Guys, I got big plans for these winnings. I'm going to build... a swimming pool."
Homer,"So freaking far in the ground, baby."
Homer,"Yeah, that's probably what happened."
Homer,I hope our friend wasn't in an accident.
Homer,I wasn't thinking that! Carl's our good friend.
Homer,"The power of friendship is so amazing, I don't feel at all suspicious of Carl."
Homer,Our money's gone.
Homer,"Guys, I think we might need a new song. FOUR BEST FRIENDS WHO NE-VER QUAR-REL"
Homer,I don't think so -- his travel neck pillow's gone from its pedestal...
Homer,"Hey, what's this? ""I've gone home. Goodbye forever, Carl Carlson."""
Homer,"I know, me too. It's the ultimate screw-over."
Homer,"Come on, you know how dudes are. We don't go digging into the past. We talk about guy stuff."
Homer,Wait a minute! Something's reflected in the lenses of Carl's sunglasses!
Homer,I just need to get closer.
Homer,He's looking at a geyser! And there's a sign in front of it!
Homer,It's too small to read.
Homer,I thought it was Superman's Superman-cave.
Homer,Fifty bucks per bag? I guess I'm only bringing one guitar on this revenge trip.
Homer,Baby... I'm going for us. That money is gonna dig us a swimming pool that'll take our broken family and make it whole.
Homer,I've already taken care of that.
Homer,"This is funny, it says here Iceland is green, and Greenland is icy. The Vikings switched the names to trick everybody."
Homer,"Just say he's black, Moe."
Homer,How do you know about Carl's family?
Homer,"All right, this is it, Carl's family home. Twenty-two..."
Homer,"Ooh, phew, oh, that's a lot of letters."
Homer,The gates are locked.
Homer,"Aw, dammit, we lost him!"
Homer,It's no use. We're perfectly matched.
Homer,We did it!
Homer,"Give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine."
Homer,"Sorry, Lenny."
Homer,What the hell is this?
Homer,"Sorry, Carl. It's World War II all over again -- America kicks Iceland's ass."
Homer,"Guys, do you think Carl was right? What if we're not real friends? Maybe we are just lonely guys who do... guy stuff..."
Homer,Put the noodles in the shed. There isn't gonna be a swimming pool.
Homer,Carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.
Homer,"Well, we won't know that till after."
Homer,But how can we learn to read ancient Icelandic?
Homer,Yes!
Homer,Forvitinn.
Homer,You can't not do it!
Homer,"Okay, let's see what this thing says."
Homer,"""When the barbarian invaders came, the Carlsons met them with their weapons ready""..."
Homer,"...""weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender. The Carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking, the looting...and the volcano-ing of the village elders."
Homer,"The Carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice."""
Homer,Carl's family was even worse than people thought.
Homer,Yieg err meth frau-baii-rr-a hoo-g-minn-d.
Homer,Attention everyone in Iceland! We have an important announcement!
Homer,Is this everyone?
Homer,"I've learned something about the people of Iceland. You've endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse, and a lesbian prime minister."
Homer,"You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs. And to do that, you have to be stubborn."
Homer,But I ask you to put aside your stubbornness while I tell you about Carl Carlson...
Homer,It doesn't matter what happened a thousand years ago. For Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.
Homer,"And when he brings a six-pack to my house, he doesn't take the extras home with him. Carl Carlson leaves them in the fridge."
Homer,"Aww... thanks, Flanders. Gotta warn ya, he doesn't talk much."
Homer,We don't get together to share our emotions. We get together to escape them.
Homer,"Okay everyone, get ready to see your brand new..."
Homer,...keg-pools!
Homer,"Fine, I'm going home."
Homer,"And we're more in love than ever. In your face, people who said it wouldn't last a year!"
Homer,Better clean that off.
Homer,"You have a great day, ma'am."
Homer,He's not your daddy.
Homer,I'll teach you to speak in complete sentences.
Homer,"But first, m'lady, let me escort you to Heaven -- the fancy Swiss chocolate store on level three!"
Homer,"Just call me Borders Books, 'cause I'll always be here."
Homer,"Yep, we've got something money can't buy - love on a train. And I promise each anniversary will be better and better..."
Homer,But somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.
Homer,"Yeah, just like we did with Bart. Anyway, this year I'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that..."
Homer,Why are you taking away the train?
Homer,"Kids, I've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. Sir, I need this train!"
Homer,She won't see it like this. I'll make this train look as beautiful as it did when this mall was young.
Homer,You stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school!
Homer,"Oh, we're still on for tomorrow night."
Homer,"Hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it?"
Homer,"Shake it off kids, they're just jealous!"
Homer,There's no such place!
Homer,Uh... anniversary? That comin' up?
Homer,"Marge, I am focused on this like a laser. ""Laser."" That's a funny word. It's just ""loser"" with an ""a."" And speaking of losers, I've lost my train of thought. Oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--"
Homer,The surprise is safe! The expression on her face will be priceless!
Homer,Currently: zero.
Homer,"Don't worry, Moe. When Marge is asleep, I'll sneak back."
Homer,"Hey, those Yelp reviews don't write themselves. Did you know a well-placed one star can destroy a mom and pop hardware in nothing flat?"
Homer,"Um, Marge, I have to go."
Homer,All worth it for Marge!
Homer,I'VE BEEN WORKIN' ON THE RAILROAD...
Homer,Because it's in the public domain?
Homer,"Oh, uh, I'd better take this. Y'see, Moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. Why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!"
Homer,"All right, all right, I'll be right there!"
Homer,"Boy, oh boy!"
Homer,"Marge, I threw my back out. Can you please refill this prescription right away?"
Homer,It's in Drugtown. Not the nice part.
Homer,"And what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: ""for worse."""
Homer,"It's working. She's gone! All right, everyone, magically appear!"
Homer,"Wow, Moe. Great shrub costume."
Homer,"You guys are the best. I just want you to know when I'm holding Marge in my arms tonight, I'll be thinking of all of you."
Homer,You think we'll last twenty-five years?
Homer,Hall and Oates? What's going on here?!
Homer,Costume drama or naughty comedy?
Homer,"You just dodged a bullet, Mister Sugarpants."
Homer,"My only secrets are my marathon time isn't four twenty-six, it's never; I often go online to see how Lindsay Wagner's looking now - fabulous; and I once pushed a kid off a swing and he broke his wrist or something. But it's no secret how much I love my Margie."
Homer,Honey... just what was going on with you and that guy?
Homer,"Oh baby, that's all I needed to hear."
Homer,How did we get here?
Homer,BUT WHEN MARGE WENT BOO HOO / I WAS BUILDING A CHOO-CHOO...
Homer,YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET...
Homer,"Okay. I'm ready for the Nuclear Workers Convention! It's a little sad. The guys who did the funny skit last year well, they're all very sick."
Homer,"Even better, I never unpacked from the time we went to Hawaii."
Homer,"Ooh, my lava's almost cooled!"
Homer,A whole weekend away from my family. I can't believe I have to miss taking the kids to buy gym uniforms. Send me a picture?
Homer,"Now look guys, we are here for one important reason: to get free swag."
Homer,SWAG! I'M GONNA GRAB FOREVER / STUFF THAT I REALLY DON'T NEED / SWAG!
Homer,I'M GONNA HAVE FORTY KEY CHAINS! / AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE FORTY KEYS! / SWAG!
Homer,"MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF..."
Homer,"MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF..."
Homer,I still haven't forgiven you for putting that dead goat in my bed!
Homer,"I'll kill you, you son of a--"
Homer,To texting!
Homer,"Hello, everyone."
Homer,"I overslept, lost my cell phone, missed my flight."
Homer,All the payphones at the airport were replaced by self-serve yogurt. I had all the cookie dough toppings a man could want.
Homer,"Yes, back to normal."
Homer,"They're called ""Superoos,"" son. With pictures of the cast of ""The Expendables""."
Homer,That kind of small scale violence solves nothing.
Homer,"Uh, I'll pass on the pork."
Homer,"I'll just enjoy these green beans with slivered almonds. Mmm, so slivered."
Homer,A napkin.
Homer,Can I just get a glass of water?
Homer,"Marge, I changed in Boise. I'm not sure a man who eats right and doesn't drink can be good in bed."
Homer,You're so beautiful when I cut you off in the middle of a question.
Homer,Moving my body.
Homer,How y'all doin'?
Homer,"If you are a cat, prove it. Do you hate Mondays like Garfield?"
Homer,And do you love lasagna... like me?
Homer,Okay then.
Homer,"Hanging up the receiver, eh?"
Homer,How much did you say?
Homer,So I heard half of nothing.
Homer,Lisa. I'll miss you when this is all over.
Homer,This conversation.
Homer,See you on the other side.
Homer,Of the house. Where the fireplace is. We're toasting marshmallows. Marshmallows.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,What was the first one again?
Homer,"Hey, I'm the one in bed with two beautiful women."
Homer,In a breaking and entering kind of way.
Homer,"Let's just say I've got to get to work on time. And if you knew me, you'd know just how odd that sounds."
Homer,No one.
Homer,HEERE'S THE CLIMAX
Homer,WHAT EVERYTHING'S BEEN BUILDING TOOOO /
Homer,HOPE IT PAYS OFF FOR YOUUU...
Homer,Weird thing under a tarp.
Homer,You laugh now but you won't be laughing soon.
Homer,How'd you get in here?
Homer,I'm not blowing up the plant. Just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to Mother Earth.
Homer,"Yes, my terrorist masters are always talking about you, Lisa."
Homer,"I missed my flight so I got in a van...with some eco-friendly activists. They wanted gas, grass or ass and brother, I had the ass."
Homer,They taught me something I found shocking: pigs aren't happy to be made into pork chops. This t-shirt lied to me!
Homer,And they also gave me an alcohol detox.
Homer,I've been listening to this song for three days and it's only the end of the first verse!
Homer,"Lisa, I've never prayed to a city in my life, and if I did, it would be Hershey, Pennsylvania. I was kneeling on the Affirmation Rug they gave me."
Homer,See?
Homer,"Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees."
Homer,"Lisa, the most horrible truth of all is the plant where I work poisons our water and our air."
Homer,"Aw, sweetie, you've told me a thousand things a million times. Even with a brain the size of a dinosaur's, I couldn't take that in."
Homer,"Anyhoo, this canister is full of spoiled milk and utility-grade chicken."
Homer,Both sold to me by Apu this morning.
Homer,"When I release it into the A. C. system, it'll stink up the plant forever."
Homer,Just like when I smell up the toilet.
Homer,"Hey, hey, it's not what you think, Lou. Lou! Lou! Lou! Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu!"
Homer,We sure did.
Homer,"No, I was just up late watching a movie. Something with... William Holden and--"
Homer,A beer from the sky! It's a sign!
Homer,Shut up.
Homer,Why you little... I'll teach you to make medical history!
Homer,Oops.
Homer,All good.
Homer,"Hey boy, since you don't need a bedroom any more, I finally get my man cave."
Homer,Man cave! Everyone's welcome to my man cave!
Homer,"Great... oh, and I have this ""two heads for one"" coupon."
Homer,How 'bout this one?
Homer,One random disorder free with every schizophrenia.
Homer,Should've chopped off Bart's head long ago.
Homer,"Ooh, mix-ins!"
Homer,Son-of-a!
Homer,THIS IS THE SONG THAT YOU HEAR AT THE CIRCUS / SUNG BY A GUY THAT YOU SEE AT THE CIRCUS...
Homer,"Marge! Get away from those freaks! You belong to me! The dumb, hairless brute!"
Homer,Taste the strength of your fiancé!
Homer,"Marge, they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold them to the circus."
Homer,With an emerald that big I could buy anything -- a jalopy! An icebox! A steamer trunk full of fedoras! But how do I get my hands on it?
Homer,"I'm an idiot! Of course! I get Marge to marry Moe, then I kill Moe, then she gets the ring, then I marry her, and the ring is mine. And the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity!"
Homer,You're gonna be sorry you said that.
Homer,"Hey Marge, you wanna marry Moe?"
Homer,The poor lonely fellow is about to die.
Homer,"Let me worry about how. But you know, you could make his last day a happy one. And the ring is just the icing on the cake."
Homer,The ring that'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus. Now let's get you married.
Homer,"But won't you be jealous, my love?"
Homer,"Dear, I am not the jealous type. And from you, I have learned to feel compassion for these disgustos."
Homer,Ho ho ho! A very small time!
Homer,"Those are strange things to say, but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride's former lover. Now, the toast..."
Homer,"To you, Marge. Now you are one of us."
Homer,One of us! Gooble goo!
Homer,"Trying to kill Moe so we'll get his emerald. By the way, I haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?"
Homer,"Strong man, Moe may be ugly on the outside, but inside, you are the true monster. Leave my trailer forever!"
Homer,"You're rejecting me? But I'm in the best shape anyone is, in the nineteen thirties."
Homer,What the hell does gooble goo mean?
Homer,"You killed Burnsum? Now who is gonna say ""Step right up""?"
Homer,This is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting!
Homer,"...and that, kids, is how I met your mother."
Homer,People called him the sixth Simpson. Not sure why.
Homer,GET DOWN / EVERYBODY'S GONNA LEAVE THEIR SEAT
Homer,"Man, this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever."
Homer,Overstay my welcome for forty years?
Homer,I'm thinking about it!
Homer,That's the coolest bowling ball I've ever seen.
Homer,"Hello, Bear Stearns? I'd like to sell all my Apple stock so I can buy a fancy bowling ball. You heard me. Technology is a fad. Heavy blue balls are the future."
Homer,You cost me a piece of all of that!
Homer,"Aw, don't cry."
Homer,I'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.
Homer,You misheard that on purpose!
Homer,"Um... it says I should give you ""lumbar support."" Better go to the lumberyard..."
Homer,"Hey book, are you expecting this?"
Homer,And while I'm at it... burn dumb helpful books!
Homer,That is a good fire.
Homer,We've had some good times.
Homer,And you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. So I'm gettin' you shined up nice.
Homer,What the?
Homer,I think I just might have what you're looking for.
Homer,Today I'm glad that I sold that stock.
Homer,Why does everyone know?!
Homer,My boy's okay!
Homer,And together we are.
Homer,"I'll handle this. ""Dear Weirdo, pick up weirdo kid."" And send."
Homer,What the?! If this kid's Dad isn't here in one second he's going in the garbage can.
Homer,"Once again, cats have it better."
Homer,"Look at me, I'm afraid of dying!"
Homer,"NO DREAM WILL COME TRUE,"
Homer,YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.
Homer,I'm tired of livin' once.
Homer,"Marge, if you don't mind, I'm gonna quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past."
Homer,My old pen pal from Spain. Eduardo.
Homer,"Back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner. I picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast. We'd write each other with our dreams of the future..."
Homer,I was gonna be King of Cheeseburger Mountain. Did I change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers? Probably a little bit of both.
Homer,So sad.
Homer,"If you're my wife's secret lover, come in. There's nothing I can do for her anymore."
Homer,Eduardo?! Is it really you? why are you here?
Homer,I'm Homer Simpson!
Homer,I wish.
Homer,"What happened to us, Eduardo? We had so many things we were going to do."
Homer,"Yeah, well listen, pal. I have my treasure: my wife and my children."
Homer,Do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name?
Homer,"Did you just fart, sir."
Homer,Really? Now? I have two pizzas coming. I wanted to see who would get here first.
Homer,Why are you doing this? Wait. Are you in love with me?
Homer,Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive concept like Liberty!
Homer,One more ride?
Homer,"I don't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled, but I feel great."
Homer,That doesn't sound happy.
Homer,"Mmm, melon collie."
Homer,"Well, what was your childhood dream?"
Homer,Let's do it.
Homer,We do that every night! Come on! Jump on the bed!
Homer,Eduardo. I haven't felt this good in years. You're like the Tooth Fairy except you don't collect human bones.
Homer,"So that's it? All my dreams, lived?"
Homer,"Well, we've gotta do it! I never leave a job unfinished. It's as true now as that week I worked on the high school yearbook. So much infighting. I had to get outta there!"
Homer,The editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend.
Homer,"Um, actually, my hero was the actress who provided Rocky's voice, June Foray. A true legend in the voiceover community. I'm just gonna stay on the plane and think about her influence."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,I'm doing it! I'm flying like the squirrel I always knew I was.
Homer,"Ooh, indigo!"
Homer,"Majestic eagle... just like me, unashamed of his baldness."
Homer,So beautiful.
Homer,"Aw, he probably sees a mouse he wants to tear in half."
Homer,Stupid tallest building in Springfield!
Homer,"Son, it was so beautiful! I went faster than the speed of sound."
Homer,"No matter what, Homer Simpson has done it. And soon I hope I remember who Homer Simpson is and his relationship to me. But I have no regrets. In fact, all this has given me a sense of calm I've never had before."
Homer,Can you give me the morphine forever?
Homer,Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo!
Homer,Oh. It was all just a dream.
Homer,Oh yeah. Great. Um... Do I drop you at the curb or do I have to park and walk you in?
Homer,"No time for breakfast, Marge. Just give me a banana."
Homer,"Now, listen... I have to work late tonight."
Homer,It's a tough economy. Money doesn't grow on trees.
Homer,It grows on threes!
Homer,"Nice sunglasses, Lenny."
Homer,"I'd better call it a night, guys. I don't want to take any more of your money."
Homer,"Who's president now, Alexander Hamilton?"
Homer,"Timing the elevators, eh? Smart."
Homer,"Okay, okay, no worries."
Homer,What the?
Homer,Everyone has a cellphone. Mine's at home.
Homer,"Everything will be fine... um... Oh you, uh, you like movies? This reminds me of that scene in ""Alien."""
Homer,The scene where she escapes with the cat at the end.
Homer,"Oh, he was just here."
Homer,You like lies? Here's a few: college is expensive but it's worth it...
Homer,"Okay Homer, remember your Lamaze training..."
Homer,"Yeah, wow, that does feel good. Oh no, I think it's coming. I haven't even picked a name yet!"
Homer,"No, I didn't!"
Homer,"Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but your baby doesn't have any legs--"
Homer,"Oh! Oh wait, there's more!"
Homer,"It's a dude! And he's uncut! Very Euro! Now, hug your mommy."
Homer,"For unto you is born this day, in this elevator, inspected in August 2009, a baby."
Homer,"Yeah, that guy didn't even look over once."
Homer,Miraculous.
Homer,Mothers are so awesome.
Homer,"Good game, everyone. I never dreamed a night where you'd discovered I was cheating and beat the crap outta me could end on such an up note."
Homer,"Hey, Gretchen!"
Homer,Good as new. And thanks for loaning me your sweater for the ride home. It may be a little stretched out.
Homer,"Wow. So now there's two things named after me -- a baby, and a law banning air horns after three a.m."
Homer,"Aw, that's sweet."
Homer,"Um, hey... I was just driving by... with some baby stuff we didn't need and uh...here's some diapers Maggie's too big for, an incredible educational toy I forgot to give Bart..."
Homer,"Wow, I'd love to help, but I did kind of have plans for tonight..."
Homer,I think I'll be good tonight and stay in with you.
Homer,Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju?!
Homer,Where's Hoju? Where's Hojuuu?!
Homer,Kids blow up so fast.
Homer,"Oh, no, I'm shopping for Homer Junior, a baby I delivered in an elevator the night I pretended to go to work but was really playing poker!"
Homer,"Oh, yes, I am shopping for Maggie, our baby together, so this looks perfectly innocent."
Homer,"Oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog..."
Homer,"Um, November."
Homer,Excuse me.
Homer,Oh baby!
Homer,"Oh baby, shake it! Homer like!"
Homer,"Shake it! Now, roll over on your tummy, just like I taught you."
Homer,Tell me what a cow says!
Homer,My other baby mama!
Homer,"Marge, it's not what you think!"
Homer,"Oh, it's cool. We did it in an elevator."
Homer,"But you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good."
Homer,I haven't had a drink for a week.
Homer,It's true. Even the other guy in the elevator. He's right here.
Homer,"Goodbye, Homer Junior. I guess you're the man of the house now. And never forget, even though the mortgage is due on the first you can usually wait till the seventeenth."
Homer,Exactly. You always said charity begins at home -- but not which home.
Homer,And now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:
Homer,"SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP!"
Homer,"Oh man, I really overdid it tonight."
Homer,"No. I'm exhausted from ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes. Knees and toes."" It's the ""toes"" that get ya, Marge. It's the toes..."
Homer,"Way ahead of you, Marge. I am taking all four of my kids to the zoo tomorrow."
Homer,Yes. We'll be back by three. Homer has a very tight nap schedule.
Homer,I was talking about myself in the third person.
Homer,"I wanted you all to be happy together, so I brought you to the zoo where all the animals live in harmony."
Homer,"Hey, oh oh oh! Now Maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family."
Homer,"Why you little... I'll give you a goodnight kiss you'll never forget! C'mere, you!"
Homer,Can I just say goodbye to him quick?
Homer,"Okay, I know what'll cheer you kids up. Seeing me out-monkey the monkeys."
Homer,I have a soul and you guys don't!
Homer,Look! Shiny keys! Jingle jangle!
Homer,Stupid monkeys.
Homer,"I'm sorry, Homer Junior. You'll occupy an idealized place in my heart that no one can never quite fill."
Homer,"Okay, I've got to impart all my fatherly advice in this one walk. The sky is blue, but no one really knows why. Don't believe what they tell you. Girls are great and terrible at the same time. Get used to it. And, most importantly-- Oops, we're here. You'll have to figure it out on your own."
Homer,"Sorry, little fella. One day I'll be that guy who comes to your wedding, makes you feel a little weird, and then runs away."
Homer,Woo hoo! Who's Chase?
Homer,You didn't tell me he was a soldier.
Homer,"Um, he likes it if you tickle his toes."
Homer,But n-n-n-nurture...
Homer,"I guess this is it, little guy."
Homer,The most beautiful words a father can hear.
Homer,Oh.
Homer,I do.
Homer,"Hi Maggie, if you could talk, I know you'd have a few choice words for me."
Homer,You want me to take care of your dolly?
Homer,That's the sweetest thing any baby has ever done for me.
Homer,"Hey, what's this marching band have to do with Homer Junior? What? There were cheerleaders in our house? And nobody told me?"
Homer,"Ooh, spaghetti."
Homer,"Y'ello! Lisa, you got a call from someone named Isabel."
Homer,"May I ask what this is regarding? Oooh, a budding new friendship? Oooh! Boy, how come you can't get a new friend?"
Homer,"All right, eighties party! Where's the beef? Tear down that wall! Because I think the beef is behind that wall!"
Homer,"Now get up here, boy! We're gonna do the Super Bowl Shuffle."
Homer,Fine. You're Mike Singletary. Enjoy your mediocre coaching career.
Homer,MY NAME IS HOMER / I'M A REAL FULL BACK / GONNA RUN THAT BALL / DON'T WANT NO FLACK...
Homer,Why you little--
Homer,You used to be fun.
Homer,That's our girl.
Homer,What your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long.
Homer,What your mother is trying to say is--
Homer,"Get real, ding dong! You've already done so much bad stuff, Skinner's never going to let you on that boat."
Homer,"Marge, I love Bart as much as you do but actually not. And that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble. Now if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, I'm going to Moe's."
Homer,Ooh! Thank you.
Homer,What the?
Homer,Come on.
Homer,"Hello, boy. At times like this there's not much you can say... especially if you don't know what happened..."
Homer,"Really? Hey, I bet that submarine isn't so fun anyway."
Homer,"As I always say, don't get mad, get dinner. Then get even. With Skinner."
Homer,Yes. What's Skinner's weakness?
Homer,Good. We can use that.
Homer,"Wait a minute... I knew you were a neat freak, Skinner. But you beat your rug till it bleeds?"
Homer,"Well, I'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently."
Homer,Let me handle things. Just go upstairs and shut the door. There are some things only a boy should see.
Homer,"Just call me ""The Cleaner."""
Homer,The deed is done.
Homer,"Look, you kill them, I get rid of them. That's always been our deal. But I do have one question: do you want the head?"
Homer,Well if you change your mind it'll be in my freezer. But only for a week. Got a lot of ice cream comin' in.
Homer,"Now, I'm afraid it's time to start your new life. You'll be hunted... on the run... searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you. So avoid mirrors."
Homer,"Sorry, but Dick Fiddler is allergic to potatoes."
Homer,Someday I may have to fake my own death. And maybe you can help me with that.
Homer,"Someday soon. As in, what are you doing this Friday?"
Homer,Dick Fiddler!
Homer,"You know, when you glare like that you look really beautiful."
Homer,"Marge, to that I say boo, humbug."
Homer,"Global Warming, huh? By pure coincidence, every scientist was right!"
Homer,Snow?! Snow!!!
Homer,"Oh, you know what this means, kids?"
Homer,I don't have to pick up the dog poops!
Homer,"Oh good. Marge remarried after I died. Wait a minute, I'm not dead. What's goin' on?"
Homer,Uh-uh! No way! I'm not sharing my bed with anybody except you! And maybe that guy. Lincoln-style. But that's it.
Homer,"Oh, I don't know. It won't seem like Christmas without opening up a giant credit card bill in January."
Homer,"What the-- ""The Simpson Bed and Breakfast?"" I always wanted to stay in a place like this!"
Homer,But Christmas is a special time. And I like to spend it in the warm embrace of watching football.
Homer,"Well, this crazy scheme is the kind of impulsive behavior I want to encourage in you. I'm in. A hundred percent!"
Homer,I'm on a break.
Homer,Fine. I'll drink alone.
Homer,The secret is don't read the comment cards.
Homer,I thought they were just gonna watch me.
Homer,"Ho, ho, ho!"
Homer,The pillow acted as a girdle.
Homer,You got me weed?
Homer,"That's great, sweetie. After all that time and hard work, I'll have... radishes?! It's the most hated part of salad, which is the most hated part of dinner! Radishes. Nothing but radishes."
Homer,What? I'm saving them from the struggle of life.
Homer,Vegetables?!
Homer,"Shut up, Flanders!"
Homer,"Oh right, we're still doing that."
Homer,"Come on, I'll drive you to the airport."
Homer,"Where are my keys? Oh, right here."
Homer,"Oh, boy. Monday morning chit chat at the water cooler. The only reason to have done stuff over the weekend."
Homer,"Wait, you guys saw the new Radioactive Man sequel?"
Homer,Stop talking! I haven't seen it yet!
Homer,But what if I want some cooled water?
Homer,"They're talking about the movie! Hurry up, you idiot! No, no, don't stop! I'm sorry I got mad. I'll do that thing you like."
Homer,AMAZING GRACE / HOW LOUD I SING / TO DROWN THE SPOILERS OUT... shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
Homer,"Okay, I've gotta go see the Radioactive Man movie before it gets totally ruined for me."
Homer,"If you all go, then I have to pay for a babysitter!"
Homer,Emily-Beth? We can't afford Emily-Beth! She brings her own puppets!
Homer,"Bye bye, money!"
Homer,"Two adults, two kids, and one senior with the mind of a baby so he should be free."
Homer,"More snip, less lip."
Homer,"All right, movie, you better be worth it."
Homer,The motorcycle dudes are chicks!
Homer,I wonder what else is chicks?
Homer,"Hey... they tricked us! That's a commercial! If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus!"
Homer,You're shushing me! This guy's on his cell phone! She's texting! He's sexting! And that guy brought a baby to a nine o'clock movie!
Homer,"What happened to the movies? First they got worse than TV, and now this!"
Homer,Illegally download it? Is that legal?
Homer,"Wow, that was easy! All I had to do was click on--"
Homer,"Bless you, boy. That was the greatest thing I've seen on a computer that I can talk about with you in the room. How did you know how to do that?"
Homer,"Guys, guys, I saw the Radioactive Man movie! Here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best -- number ten: when what's his name did that stuff with those dudes. Number nine--"
Homer,Shut up shut up shut up!
Homer,Theaters? All I need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. Care to join me?
Homer,"Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people -- an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern day movie-going!"
Homer,And best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!
Homer,"Welcome to ""Cinema Pirate-diso."" Tonight's movie is ""Life is Funny,"" directed by Judd Apatow. It's based on his life, starring his family, and adlibbed by his friends. So for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!"
Homer,"I live it, he writes it."
Homer,"Well, what'd you think?"
Homer,"Let me? Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the internet... illegally."
Homer,Why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the Air Buds and Ray Liottas of the world?
Homer,"I now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, ""Cosmic Wars Episode Seven""."
Homer,"Ooo, mastermind."
Homer,One of you turned me in? Who was it?
Homer,You!
Homer,"Superintendent Chalmers, you never forgave me for that time we wore the same Hawaiian shirt to that luau!"
Homer,"Baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in!"
Homer,It's probably someone I would never suspect! Never suspect!
Homer,Your moans of sympathy are all I have!
Homer,Whoever did this will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever!
Homer,Forever!
Homer,What are you guys in for?
Homer,Movie piracy.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"I can't go back to jail! There's no shampoo, just soap!"
Homer,"Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to ""Taken"" where the ""Hangover"" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is ""Fast and Furious."""
Homer,Consulate.
Homer,"Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital."
Homer,Thank you so much for sticking with me through all this. You're the greatest wife in the world.
Homer,You? How could you? You're my own flesh and blood!
Homer,"Have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish, to aid and abet?"
Homer,Well you did. And they got laughs. Solid laughs.
Homer,All I ever had was you looking out for me. I've got nothin' now.
Homer,No.
Homer,"You know what, Judge Apatow... I do have something to say. These movie people may say I'm a pirate. But I'm just a man. A man who loved Hollywood too much. So I made my own rules, and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life."
Homer,At first my wife didn't believe in me. Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.
Homer,"But when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in."
Homer,"One family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost."
Homer,I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.
Homer,What the hell is all this?!
Homer,You're pirating my movie?
Homer,The hell you are! Piracy is stealing! You're taking money out of my family's mouths.
Homer,"Oh that's Hollywood fantasy. We live in the real world, where I have something called ""prof-it par-ti-ci-pa-tion""."
Homer,Now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens! No bargain matinees!
Homer,And tell your friends it was great! Buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it.
Homer,Homer in the movie wears Ask Body Spray and so should you. Don't ask! Do smell!
Homer,Up bup bup bup bup! What have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband?
Homer,What?
Homer,"And miss the back half of Jimmy Kimmel? That's when he experiments, boy."
Homer,Yes I have! After the Oscars when he forces you!
Homer,"C'mon, buddy. I gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife."
Homer,Marge and I get along perfect. We're like George Burns and John Denver.
Homer,"Man, carrying these kids is hard on my back."
Homer,And now to Moe's.
Homer,Bart! Your comic vendor's here!
Homer,I will help you. As long as our bellies never touch again like they are right now.
Homer,But why pick me?
Homer,Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu!
Homer,Honki da yo?!
Homer,"Not garbage, Americana."
Homer,"We've talked about this, Marge. The hammock is a chore-free zone."
Homer,Not a word.
Homer,"You're Kumiko's father? Welcome, sensei!"
Homer,"I know, Mr. Sparkle."
Homer,I get that a lot too.
Homer,"Okay, she moved in with her boyfriend. Well, he's not a boy. He's immature, but fat and old."
Homer,I didn't tell you about the basement.
Homer,"No, discipline would imply I'm trying to make him better... so, are you married?"
Homer,Now that's disgusting. Wine made of rice?
Homer,Why didn't I stop with the snake wine? Why did I drink the fish wine?
Homer,What's going on here?
Homer,Why you slimy little...!?
Homer,As long as we keep drinking this.
Homer,GLOWING RODS / GLOWING RODS / IT'S MAKING ME / WEAK AND DIZZY...
Homer,Who told you that?
Homer,I hope it's better than last year's lousy gift.
Homer,Glasses! Call Lenny!
Homer,"Lenny! It's me, Homer!"
Homer,Really? Don't you ever look up at the sky?
Homer,I'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.
Homer,Look at these jerks.
Homer,"I'll let you try them on, right after I decide if these videos are ""Funny Or Die"". Funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died..."
Homer,"Now, a simple Sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown!"
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,"Springfield City Hall was built for the Spencer Tracy movie ""Meet Me At City Hall"". It was just a flat wall with nothing behind it for thirty years..."
Homer,The rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...
Homer,"As early as eighteen fifty-nine, ""shut up"" was used to shut up..."
Homer,"Glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant I can afford."
Homer,"That's it, I'm taking you off."
Homer,Reality!
Homer,"Okay, let's see what we've got here."
Homer,"Squeeze here. Rotate there. Pause for sweet talk. Oh glasses, you're so wonderful."
Homer,Where's my money?
Homer,But the avatar looks just like you!
Homer,"Glasses, find me a great gift for my wife. Under five dollars."
Homer,"Glasses, take me two minutes back in time."
Homer,Marge...
Homer,About the glasses...
Homer,"I'm really sorry, and..."
Homer,Only five pancakes? You're trying to kill me!
Homer,"Look, honey, I know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. Isn't that right, glasses?"
Homer,"Anyway, I'm giving them up... ...to whoever dares take them."
Homer,"Hey, everybody!"
Homer,"Carl, it's me! I'm here! Really here!"
Homer,Ow!
Homer,Stop!
Homer,Wait!
Homer,What! No one can live in a non-augmented reality! I need another pair of glasses!
Homer,"Um, Mr. Burns, sir? Can I get another pair of glasses? Maybe two pair. One for the beach house. Can I also get a beach house? Two beach houses..."
Homer,Monitors?!
Homer,What the-- Burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us!
Homer,This is a violation of our human rights.
Homer,"Okay, so let's see what we can see!"
Homer,"Solitaire, top hats on eBay, Angry Birds fan fiction...guy doing really easy crossword puzzle...Lenny doing Carl's clown makeup."
Homer,...someone's actually working...
Homer,Maggie?!
Homer,"Awww... Wait a minute... since Marge is wearing my glasses, I can see everything she sees. Uh-uh, I shouldn't watch this."
Homer,Wait a minute. Marge said we were out of ice cream.
Homer,What else is Marge hiding from me?
Homer,Is she having an affair?
Homer,Why isn't she having an affair?
Homer,Mr. Burns!
Homer,"Marge, that's a compact-only space!"
Homer,"Well, who knew you were such a rebel? Now, let's learn more about my wife's secret life. Secrets which can only be good."
Homer,Marge is in therapy?
Homer,Pale ales. Please.
Homer,Not Marmaduke! Never Marmaduke!
Homer,"Marmaduke was horrible today! Also, Marge is in therapy and she didn't even tell me!"
Homer,"Spied on her with a hidden camera. She thinks I'm selfish, she thinks I don't spend enough time with the kids..."
Homer,I guess the only choice is to come clean and tell her what I know... and how I know.
Homer,"Moe, that's great. How do you get your ideas?"
Homer,"Yeah, you do like your secrets, don't you, Marge?"
Homer,"Uh, I'm here to check in for the three o'clock."
Homer,"That's ""Fake Name."""
Homer,"That's ""Alias."" Du-uh."
Homer,Oh my God... Marge needs this. It lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.
Homer,No need. Everything's fine.
Homer,"Well, as long as I'm paying for the time..."
Homer,"Ow! Where'd you learn to cut hair, idiot?"
Homer,"I don't need to know, Marge. You deserve to have your secrets."
Homer,"Okay, Marge. But first, well, I have something I need to tell you. Something I did you might be mad about, and rightly so."
Homer,Woo-hoo! I tried! Okay.
Homer,Yeah. And?
Homer,Where's that cake now?
Homer,Who bought it?
Homer,Excuse me. I have to make a call.
Homer,"Okay, Hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged."
Homer,"Wait, something's wrong. That's better."
Homer,"Sorry son, I only have twenties. And if God needs money, why doesn't he just write another Bible? The first one sold pretty well."
Homer,"All right, son... but you have to pay me back."
Homer,Do you have my money?
Homer,Do you have my money?
Homer,"Right, right, too soon. Do you have my money?"
Homer,"Seriously, do you have my money?"
Homer,Where's my money?
Homer,Where's... my... mon... ey?
Homer,"Where's my money? Do you have my money? Where is it? You know, if you had the money, I'm right here. Do you have the money?"
Homer,"Pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, Marge."
Homer,Quit pressuring me!
Homer,What? Did you owe me some money?
Homer,"Hey, you've said it twice, Marge. You're in pretty deep."
Homer,Ten minute rule.
Homer,Sit. Sit. Sit! Sit! SIT!!!
Homer,"I don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!"
Homer,"Oh, I know what that means. There comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. Finally! I was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler."
Homer,"More like ""at your six-pack,"" am I right? It's okay if you need to take a little nap."
Homer,Because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!
Homer,But it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.
Homer,It's even better than I thought... you've found your Moe Szyslak! In just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of Journey.
Homer,What's he doing?
Homer,"Okay. In your terms, points are like mice."
Homer,Don't interrupt! I just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.
Homer,Fine! But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
Homer,"Look, the Eagles and the Falcons. Tell me you're not interested in that."
Homer,I could fly too if I didn't have a wife and three kids!
Homer,At least someone in this family is using them.
Homer,"Uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. You know, Dweebler."
Homer,Because it's his home forever.
Homer,"I'm eating the food of the future. Beep, boop. What is... love? Boop, beep, boop."
Homer,"Ooh, campus! Do you have a statue of the founder I can stick a funny hat on?"
Homer,Go! Go! Go!
Homer,Real doctor or PhD?
Homer,Sideshow Bob!
Homer,Overfed? I don't know this word.
Homer,Fine. I'll take you. They have this cool psych class at the campus I sat in on.
Homer,It doesn't matter. I'm taking it pass-fail.
Homer,That's why I've got to get the marshmallows down fast.
Homer,I like how they cut them down from a hundred and forty characters to a more manageable twenty characters.
Homer,"Marge, teens can't control their urges. It's why there's never been a teenage President."
Homer,"No. I'm saying you're wasting everyone's time. But it's a church thing, so that's a given."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,"Listen, you punks. If you can't handle the image of our naked bodies in the tender act of a-oo-ga, you should never have come to the basement of this holy place."
Homer,What the--
Homer,Never!
Homer,How dare you torture my children with Mozart!
Homer,I call all music Mozart!
Homer,"If it's not final, who cares?"
Homer,"If it's important, they'll call back."
Homer,That man can't remember anything except our number!
Homer,"My contract clearly promised ""barely livable""!"
Homer,"Oh... I guess Grampa's coming home with us. Unless... what about that nice dog boarding place? The really good one, where they each have their own dog ""partner."""
Homer,"You're right. Bad idea, bad idea... Should we just, y'know... drive by and take a look at the place? Bad idea, bad."
Homer,"Honey, Grampa is the closest thing I have to a father and I love him. But three octogenocerouses?"
Homer,Speak for yourself. Glug-glug-glug. Chomp-chomp-chomp. Beeeeep. My lifestyle is my retirement plan.
Homer,"Uh... c'mon, boy. Your job is to guide me."
Homer,"I mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!"
Homer,"You just wanna see your old man trip and fall! Well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--"
Homer,"I've had it up to here with those freeloading wrinkle bags. They pee all night, they cry all day and every time they use the computer the font is huge!"
Homer,Have you seen how he treats my Grampa? Never visits him. Never even acknowledges his existence.
Homer,Oh yeah!
Homer,"Okay. You know, I love him too. In a manly way that never shows itself."
Homer,"I can handle them from now on, Marge."
Homer,"Gentlemen, I've been thinking. My glorious youth and beauty won't last forever. Someday, when the leaves have turned, and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, I will be old."
Homer,I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.
Homer,"Wow, never had breakfast at six in the morning before."
Homer,"Oh, when does the exercise start?"
Homer,Oh my God! This counts as exercise? I'm barely moving and I'm smelling Cinnebun. Sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. I'm a seventy-nine-year-old man!
Homer,"Uh, okay! Um... I can't."
Homer,"All you gals like chicken dinners, Marge."
Homer,Better turn up the heat.
Homer,"Young lady, in my day..."
Homer,You won't feel so bolloxed once my social security checks start coming.
Homer,Falsies.
Homer,Oh my God! I know that kid! We've gotta help him!
Homer,Fine. Your generation did its part when it won World War Two and created the Rockford Files. I've got this one.
Homer,"Oh, it is so hard running in sand."
Homer,No. No. I can't be old yet. I won't let the ravages of time catch up with me till I'm fifty-two!
Homer,I'm coming at you with all the power of a reverse mortgage!
Homer,"Now let's go home, son."
Homer,We've got ten minutes between the kids falling asleep and the old guys waking up.
Homer,"Lisa ""wants"" ""a"" ""dot dot dot""..."
Homer,Guinea pig?
Homer,"Lisa got to you. I don't know how, but she got to you."
Homer,Emojis. Now she's gone too far.
Homer,"Circle ""other."""
Homer,"Boilerplate, boilerplate, boilerplate... we can skip all this litter box stuff... if pet becomes internet superstar, all rights revert to father... Sign here, here, initial here, one more over here, and... done."
Homer,"The kid-parent contract -- unenforceable, yet you feel like you didn't completely cave."
Homer,"You don't have children, do you?"
Homer,"She's gone, honey. She's gone."
Homer,She thinks she's decided. Don't say a thing. Don't blow this!
Homer,Fighting Tweakers rule!
Homer,Kettle corn... the heroin of the farmer's market.
Homer,Sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money. Or...
Homer,"Yeah, these seem great. Oh, too bad someone used cello rosin."
Homer,I don't know. How 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?
Homer,You know it's rockin' 'cause music notes are coming out of it.
Homer,"Well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks."
Homer,You guys are crazy. I've never even heard of that guy. It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.
Homer,"Now, ere's what makes art valuable: 1. Nudity. 2. Holograms. 3. Something terrible happening to Jesus."
Homer,"Nobody touch it! Bart, stop looking at it!"
Homer,"No, you'll wear it out!"
Homer,"Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right."
Homer,"Split it? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
Homer,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Homer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... split it with them?"
Homer,"Yes, they sold it to us. So now it's our painting. We can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep."
Homer,This dude gets it.
Homer,I don't know what you're talking about. Hide the treasure!
Homer,"Are they, Marge? If you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid?"
Homer,"I would feel: A). Happy for their good fortune, B). Proud to know rich people, and C). Grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake."
Homer,Then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!
Homer,"Marge, you like kindness, right?"
Homer,"So even if we gave Kirk and Luann some of money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti."
Homer,Homer looks into Marge's eyes.
Homer,It's kinder never to tell them.
Homer,What'll it take to buy your silence?
Homer,"Okay Milhouse, the guys in back are putting your new bike together."
Homer,I guess. You're funny! No wonder Lisa's in love with you.
Homer,We had a deal. And now we've got nothing...
Homer,"We were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it!"
Homer,That's exactly how it is.
Homer,Oh it is.
Homer,"Oh, that was cold, Luann. So cold! BRRRRR! SARCASTIC BRRRRRR!"
Homer,"Honey, there's something I wanna show you."
Homer,"I don't know whose this is. I found it next to the cash machine, and I've always kept it. Look at the balance."
Homer,"With that painting we could have what these people have. A money cushion. No more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter."
Homer,That's the cushion.
Homer,Don't worry. No one's gonna see this stupid show.
Homer,"""You have no obligation to share the money from that painting."" Ooo, a support rock!"
Homer,Just close your eyes and think of the cushion.
Homer,"The paddles, Marge! Look at the paddles!"
Homer,Our cushion!
Homer,"Excuse me, we're trying to find ""Café Artiste."""
Homer,I guess I can't help but feel fully responsible.
Homer,"What you need, my friend, is a Canadian Duff. Beauty, eh?"
Homer,"So, why does that chick think she owns the painting?"
Homer,"Not your fault, man. Those parasailing guys take whatever they want."
Homer,"Okay, all I gotta do is take a quick ferry to Isla Verde, find Café Artiste, and they'll back up Kirk's story. That will prove the painting was his -- and now ours."
Homer,But our cushion...
Homer,I wish I knew how.
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just remember, if your mother asks, I took you to a wine tasting."
Homer,That's why she'll believe it.
Homer,"Sounds delicious. It's not. Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here."
Homer,And that man sold it to me!
Homer,That proves the painting is mine! And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!
Homer,I love art!
Homer,Who?
Homer,Prove it.
Homer,Oh... crap.
Homer,Then why did the auction house say it was real?
Homer,Now let's play human foosball!
Homer,"What if I never liked the painting, and only wanted it for money?"
Homer,"Oh, great. The painting is worthless...this was all for nothing. And when Marge finds out she's gonna kill me."
Homer,While you're at it... could you make me a couple more?
Homer,I'll pay you in Strupo...
Homer,Rockin'
Homer,"Marge, it happened again!"
Homer,Loser.
Homer,Pathetic.
Homer,He makes me sick.
Homer,"The trick is, wait several weeks."
Homer,I'm so glad I was forced to come.
Homer,'CAUSE I'M A GRADE SCHOOL HERO / LISA NEVER LIES / I'M A GRADE SCHOOL HERO / AND HEROES NEVER DIE / JUST ONE GUITAR! SLUNG WAY DOWN LOW / YEAH ONE GUITAR! / WHERE DID MY LAWNMOWER GO?!
Homer,"Lisa, your speech was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me."
Homer,When did you come up with the idea? You must've worked on it for days.
Homer,There's sausage being made? Where?
Homer,Coming! I haven't forgotten about the sausage.
Homer,Ooh!
Homer,Oh yeah. That's the thing the guys at the drycleaners get so excited about every four years.
Homer,"Of course I am, but how do you know?"
Homer,Much better.
Homer,"Well, no one has ever has questioned my professionalism. Except at my profession."
Homer,"What do you think, sweetie?"
Homer,The two thousand eight Super Bowl?
Homer,It's okay. I'm an American!
Homer,"Sure, why not?"
Homer,"""Congratulations on your purchase of a FootMaster brand soccer ball."" Thanks, book!"
Homer,I believe the sweet little girl in twenty-one D would disagree with you.
Homer,What the?!
Homer,"Look at you, using approved electronic devices."
Homer,"Here you go, honey."
Homer,The stomach wants what it wants. I need some air.
Homer,"Ah, Brazil. I couldn't stay afraid of you forever. The only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream. That is a deal breaker."
Homer,Thanks. I still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.
Homer,You don't know the new me of the last few days at all!
Homer,Red card!
Homer,Get outta here!
Homer,How fresh?
Homer,Where's your mother?
Homer,"Give the donuts to the hotel staff. Release the pig, and the bowling ball, into the wild."
Homer,Yes. But knowing that Lisa chose me as her hero... without ever considering any other hero... keeps me strong.
Homer,Why so quiet?
Homer,I'm listening. And it better be devastating.
Homer,"Oh my God. That's, that's shattering. And now, I'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy."
Homer,To drink until there's no pain left in my soul. But first I'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall!
Homer,Fine. Marge is always complaining I never fix things. Give me another.
Homer,I carry my own.
Homer,"If I bet it, I could double it. But on who?"
Homer,Thanks for telling me. I was gonna tape it.
Homer,Wave a Brazilian flag so you'll stand out in the crowd.
Homer,You're a funny one to tell me about deception.
Homer,"Well, if we're going to be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness."
Homer,It was pity-fridged!
Homer,"Oh, come here."
Homer,Everything's right with the world.
Homer,"That's all right, brain. If I die, I'll be doing the thing I love the most: trying not to get killed."
Homer,No penalty!
Homer,"I repeat, no penalty!"
Homer,No penalty!
Homer,"Well, at least I'll die the American way. In a foreign country wearing short pants."
Homer,No penalty.
Homer,I've never seen anything so beautiful.
Homer,"Hey-hey, what--"
Homer,Cleats.
Homer,Um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. Turn on eighty-nine point nine.
Homer,"Like most of my problems, it all started at Moe's..."
Homer,"Once intoxicated, we had a great idea."
Homer,Hey! Look at me! I'm going up a slide!
Homer,Best recess ever!
Homer,Help me guys! Guys?
Homer,"Am I gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?"
Homer,But I did learn something from all this. The sprinklers in this park come on at three a.m.
Homer,"Oh, are the kids with you?"
Homer,"Hey, guys! Why are you ducked down like that?"
Homer,Don't worry. It's bottom all right.
Homer,Competitive eater? Did I hear right? I could be a competitive eater?
Homer,"Yes I did! I heard ""competitive eater""!"
Homer,Then that makes me the Jackie Robinson of the sport. And you are the racist Philadelphia manager!
Homer,I will when you open your mind to change!
Homer,Eight hundred dollars to cut me outta that slide? It's all about the money with those firemen.
Homer,She can smash a salad.
Homer,What the?
Homer,"Marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. Don't hide behind a magazine."
Homer,Wait. Let me get this straight. Sit and eat? That's my punishment?
Homer,"Oh, I can fake attentive. I've been watching a football game this whole discussion."
Homer,"Okay, okay. We'll make it fun. I'll take her to that crab place. All the crabs you could smash."
Homer,She might marry someone like me? You think that would be bad!?
Homer,"Marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper!"
Homer,I'm sleeping on Flanders' couch tonight. Ours is crap.
Homer,"...so Marge says I gotta ""ask Lisa on a date."""
Homer,Feels weird.
Homer,"Oh, It's ringing!"
Homer,"Uh, Hello. Lisa. I know your brother and..."
Homer,"Stupid, stupid, stupid!"
Homer,"Uh, yeah. Hey, listen, your mom thinks that maybe you and I should have dinner together, sometime..."
Homer,"Yeah, I knew you'd think it's dumb--"
Homer,Woo-hoo! I got a date with my daughter!
Homer,"Hello, Marjorie."
Homer,"Yes, well it's a special evening. And I thought it best not to look like a monkey."
Homer,"Don't worry. I won't embarrass you. I will put my napkin in my lap. I will use the utensils provided for me. And if our food is slow in coming I will ""blow my stack"" in a manner befitting the Earl of Yarborough."
Homer,"Hey, I can't screw this up or Lisa will get stuck with someone like me."
Homer,"Ooh, pepperoni!"
Homer,Is there no end to your fault-finding?!
Homer,"Maggie, help me with this shirt."
Homer,"Nope. Now, how's that drink? Can I Temple up that Shirley?"
Homer,"Uh, yeah, help me out here. What is the ""normal amount"" of entrees per person?"
Homer,I mean for adults!
Homer,No. I mean for adult males.
Homer,"All right, I'll have the lasagna."
Homer,"Oh, uh. Vegetarian. Can the red sauce be cow blood?"
Homer,"Marge please, control your jealousy. This is your daughter!"
Homer,"Um. Excuse me, Lisa."
Homer,A friend from high school.
Homer,"I'm sorry, that's all very nice. But I can't forget what you said."
Homer,Where'd you get that dress?
Homer,Wow. Wow. That looks just like the dress you wore on Project Runway.
Homer,"Oh, right. I mean, this looks like a dress from a local Springfield store. All is forgiven. Let's have dinner."
Homer,"Thanks, Frenchy."
Homer,"Oh, how much did I eat?!"
Homer,Pfft! I'm as healthy as a horse.
Homer,"Marge is right. I'm gonna walk upstairs, take her in my arms and tell her my good health starts now."
Homer,Legs pumping! Blood flowing!
Homer,Two at a time! Heart exploding.
Homer,All that's left are clever last words.
Homer,I'm number two!
Homer,Somebody kill me.
Homer,"Amen, baby! Did you make potato salad for the wake?"
Homer,I'm back! Comin' through!
Homer,"Yeah, I can die all I want -- Frink's got Homers like the Tuileries has park benches. Huh? Wonder where I picked that up."
Homer,Two weeks?
Homer,Wait a minute!
Homer,Yo. Where's my body?
Homer,"Bonk! Bonk! Bonk! Ooh, corner! Ba-donk!"
Homer,"Hey kids, wanna chase Grandpa Homer around the house?"
Homer,"It's not exactly fun and games for me either, Marge."
Homer,"Oooh, ""Goody Gobble""!"
Homer,"Woo-hoo, liquid center power-up!"
Homer,"Uh, Marge? 'Scuse me. Uh, I think I need a reboot."
Homer,Just stick the tip of your pen in that little hole and hold it for fifteen minutes...
Homer,"No, no, no! Don't pull me out before you click eject! That hurts like a mother--"
Homer,"Son, can you put me in 3-D for a second?"
Homer,Why you little! I'll teach you to emulate my sloppiness!
Homer,'Bout time!
Homer,Hey! Where's my junk?
Homer,Whew!
Homer,Sure.
Homer,Body. To Moe's.
Homer,"Open your stance a little, there. Yeah, that's it. Do your worst, kids!"
Homer,"Come on! Hug your Grampa, boys!"
Homer,Threat perceived. Terminate! Terminate!
Homer,Kids are so afraid of being terminated.
Homer,"Lookin' good, Santa's Little Hybrid."
Homer,I think that's about to change.
Homer,"Yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade."
Homer,Whoa. That's a bit of a woo-hoo. Indeed.
Homer,Sit down.
Homer,"Well, better get home. The delightfulness ended hours ago."
Homer,"Why are you doing this to me, booze? I drank every kind of you!"
Homer,"Have a good day, you two! Don't be me!"
Homer,"Do you know how embarrassed I was to get a call, at my arraignment, for my behavior during the pub crawl, because of a voodoo curse my son placed on his art teacher?"
Homer,"Oh, everyone does, son. That's why they lock it up in museums where no one will ever visit."
Homer,"Hey, I created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that."
Homer,Yeah... well just talk about sports!
Homer,Flanders! Can we borrow your spatula?!
Homer,And you never bought a replacement?
Homer,Why you little! I'll teach you to answer peoples' prayers!
Homer,"What is your problem, boy?"
Homer,"Wow. I've gotta take that in. While I do, have some bar nuts."
Homer,Eat the nuts! They're your dinner!
Homer,"Thanks, Moe, I... huh. Must've left my wallet at home."
Homer,Fat Tony?
Homer,Hey!
Homer,"Do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? Just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop."
Homer,"Well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it."
Homer,Anything else?
Homer,How is it my fault?
Homer,LET THEM RUCK THE NIGHT AWAY!
Homer,I just did that because it was a series of funny words!
Homer,"Huh? Maybe you're right, boy. It's time I was a better father. And I'll start by saving us. I just need to facilitate some horse intercourse."
Homer,"Come on, buddy. Just make a champion thoroughbred and we're outta here."
Homer,"Hey, you know, I don't think this guy likes girls."
Homer,Not like that. It's like this. ...Smithers ... ...Mr. Largo... ...Danny Kaye... What? Everyone knows.
Homer,Now where's she going?
Homer,"Hey, I know that horse! It's Sudsley! Sudsley Brew-Right!"
Homer,That horse was instrumental in me becoming a man.
Homer,Beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.
Homer,"You know, pregnant is pregnant..."
Homer,"We're not lost, boy. Not by a longshot. We just have to set the mood."
Homer,"LET THEM PLAY! WE WON'T LOOK, WE'LL TURN AWAY / GO MAKE LOVE, THEN EAT SOME HAY..."
Homer,BE THAT AS IT MAY
Homer,FAT TONY'S HORSE IS GAY!
Homer,ROLL IN HAY!
Homer,I DON'T CARE ABOUT TOMORROW / WE NEED TRUE HORSE LOVE TODAY
Homer,HERE'S A BLANKET THEY CAN BORROW
Homer,"Ah, young love."
Homer,You monster! My knees will be in my throat!
Homer,Teach him not to pee during parades. He'll get more work.
Homer,Ooh! Can I lick the ceiling?
Homer,Fine.
Homer,"Ooh, doubles!"
Homer,"Because couples friends are a myth, started by restaurants with tables for four."
Homer,"Okay, sweetie, I'll call the Van Houtens."
Homer,But...
Homer,They all make good points.
Homer,Oh. Thank you. Why was that on the Military History Channel?
Homer,Can I check out what toys they have?
Homer,Dinner party at the neighbors'. At least I can drink.
Homer,"Walking distance, Marge. I've been looking forward to this all week!"
Homer,"You know, I have more cheeks."
Homer,They'll get their blood money.
Homer,Question. It says here the murderer is Admiral Wainsworth. Who's that?
Homer,"Well, you know--"
Homer,Why you--
Homer,"Well, as we say in Russia: ""Goodbye in Russian""!"
Homer,"Uh, nice night for a walk."
Homer,Do you want to be more alone?
Homer,More?
Homer,What the?
Homer,"Okay, I slept on the couch, and I flipped the sweaty cushions over. What else can I do?"
Homer,Mmmm--
Homer,"Because... Oh. Oh, okay, okay. What should we do?"
Homer,I see.
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,"Well, if that's how you think it has to be."
Homer,It might be easier with Maggie. She's always getting letters from the Daycare center.
Homer,So... where are all the friends?
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,"Well, Lisa's going to be here in five minutes, and the only kid who showed up is Gus Frickin' Huebner!"
Homer,Yeah. Nothin-- Nothing's going on.
Homer,Lots of pizza.
Homer,"See, Marge. Problems will work themselves out if you just leave them alone."
Homer,You gave away ice cream?!
Homer,"Oh God, oh God, I'm the smart parent."
Homer,"I'm sorry she rejected your ""I'm Sorry,"" cake, but in a way, I'm not. I guess what I'm trying to say is I like cake."
Homer,Is that the boy you named me after?
Homer,You pay Lenny and Carl to be my friends?
Homer,"Dad, is that story really true?"
Homer,Crap!
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. As a favor to you, I'm enrolling that precious little jerk in this fresh air summer camp."
Homer,Needs more numerators.
Homer,"Ah, July fourth-- No fireworks?! Can't this stupid city entertain me one night a year?"
Homer,"Marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. The Fourth of July is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into America's car window. God bless her."
Homer,"Marge, if this stupid, one-reactor town won't put on a fireworks show, I will. I've mapped it out."
Homer,I've had my problems with sparklers.
Homer,"Now let's see... which pants have that card? board shorts, interested shorts, here we are."
Homer,Kaboom.
Homer,"Giuseppe, I want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career."
Homer,"If the Expendables movies have taught us anything, it's that people do their best work after they're old and forgotten."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Okay. Let's make some fireworks.
Homer,Oh thank God. A rickety bridge.
Homer,Can I pitch something?
Homer,My boy's having a bad night. We should get the show on the road.
Homer,Come on. Let's go. I can't stand to see my family unhappy on America's holiest day.
Homer,"Hey, Super Mario. Don't you tell me about America!"
Homer,"No, you're a-wrong!"
Homer,Who the hell is that?!
Homer,SOMETIMES WHEN WE TOUCH
Homer,"One more year, tops."
Homer,"Then burn on you, 'cause you'll be holding onto a dead guy!"
Homer,"Believe me, if you're holding a three-hundred-pound dead guy, fear is not gonna be your problem."
Homer,It's a song? I thought we were just riffing.
Homer,I don't!
Homer,Usher! Will you stop that person who's shushing?!
Homer,Out of my reach? Must... make... effort...
Homer,What's on TV?
Homer,Why you little! I'll show you who's a Flabbi!
Homer,All muscle. In Minnesota I'd be a supermodel!
Homer,"Yes, son. We can."
Homer,Huh? Oh.
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, great. I guess my getting-up days are over."
Homer,"Lisa, what are you doing?"
Homer,But...
Homer,"Oh Lisa, honey, you can't insulate yourself from life. Why I could live till a hundred or a bus could hit me tomorrow. That's why I never plan more than four seconds ahead."
Homer,"Now come on, give Daddy a hug."
Homer,Bubble wrap!
Homer,"Your daughterly love saved me, sweetie!"
Homer,Me neither.
Homer,Brief nudityyy!
Homer,I thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.
Homer,I told you to clean your room and instead you're watching chest videos! Look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal!
Homer,I know how cereal works. Now clean your room.
Homer,I'm in charge. You do what I say.
Homer,That better not mean what it means when I say it.
Homer,We're not similar. I love being told what to do by someone who's wise in the ways of the world! Love it!
Homer,You poor woman. Dealing with Bart has turned your mind to ketchup water. You rest. I'll be the boy's father now.
Homer,Milk. That's for babies and old guys who can't sleep at night because of what they did in the war. Broccoli.
Homer,You are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. And I'm going to sit right here until you do.
Homer,Eat your broccoli.
Homer,Eat your broccoli.
Homer,Today's our draft! I've got to pick a good fantasy team! When I lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...
Homer,Jebus loves Tebow.
Homer,"Marge, I want you, my wife, to draft my fantasy football team."
Homer,I can get another job! Who wouldn't want to hire a man who won't back down? I could be a prison warden or a southern anything.
Homer,"Uh, works for me."
Homer,You did that on purpose! You lick this table clean!
Homer,Come on. Lick it!
Homer,"C'mon, lick it!"
Homer,You can still lick it!
Homer,I don't know. Eat your broccoli.
Homer,We're on an old-time boat!
Homer,Relation Ship. It works two ways. Pretty good. Pret-ty good.
Homer,I'm the lame ass? The only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses.
Homer,"Wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. You're enjoying this, aren't you?"
Homer,You're my son and you will hate what I hate. Angled parking. Lemons. Kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. And this boat!
Homer,Betrayed by my worst enemy. I never would have seen it coming.
Homer,I finally got over my sea sickness.
Homer,I hate the Golden Age of Sail.
Homer,"Fine. I'll swab whatever you say. Look, I'm swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. Oh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean."
Homer,"Ooo! Swab, swab, swab--"
Homer,What the?
Homer,Fantasy football has turned every man in this town into a trash-talking monster!
Homer,"I love this boat, with all its pullies and flappies and... everything has a name."
Homer,Yeah...
Homer,Are you crazy? We'll never make it! Drop the anchor and wait out the storm!
Homer,I'm dropping the anchor!
Homer,You've never done what I say! Ever!
Homer,"Awaiting your orders, Mr. Midshipman!"
Homer,"Aye-aye, sir."
Homer,Does this answer your question?
Homer,I GOT A BAD SUNBURN AND I WAS CRAPPED ON BY A SEAGULL / I DON'T SEE ANY LIFEBOATS AND I DON'T THINK THAT IS LEGAL
Homer,WAY HEAL AWAY! / WE'LL HEAL AWAY JOE!
Homer,Hey! I was listenin' to that!
Homer,Absolutely not.
Homer,"My one weakness: the third ""really."" Come with me."
Homer,Turn right here. I keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power.
Homer,"Seriously, I am getting so tired of those stupid Flandersisms."
Homer,Okily Dokahama?!
Homer,It's all gonna thaw!
Homer,Don't you give up on me!
Homer,And I will wait and worry!
Homer,"Aw, somebody wants more crusts. Here you go, boy!"
Homer,Here ya go. Have some more.
Homer,"Still hungry, buddy?"
Homer,Lucky.
Homer,"Oh Marge, once again you've taken one of my screw-ups and turned it into food. Man, if only you could do that with Bart."
Homer,Familyicious.
Homer,"What are you doing here, freezer stealer?"
Homer,Woo hoo! Flanders isn't perfect!
Homer,Yeah! And aren't!
Homer,None.
Homer,"Careful, Marge, that's how I bankrupted a Pizza Hut."
Homer,"Well, you woke up the right man in bed."
Homer,"I love you, Marjorie. And I've had my share of failures, sure. And sometimes I get pretty nervous. But thanks for talking it out with me. I think I can finally get to sleep now."
Homer,Make love now?
Homer,"No, no, I'd like to see the manager."
Homer,"Marge, come on, let's celebrate! It's your first day!"
Homer,"Hey, Tony Roma's wasn't built in a day. But don't worry. I told everyone about this place and they're all going to support you. You do have drone delivery, right? I kinda promised that."
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,"Don't worry, baby."
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. They can't beat us. Because we're family-run."
Homer,Hillbillies!
Homer,Finally! A customer!
Homer,"Uh, Mr. Burns, I'd like you to meet... Mother Hubbard standee."
Homer,Whew!
Homer,"Marge, have you ever seen pants do this?"
Homer,I'm a litigious business man and I need a coffee to go.
Homer,Why do these things happen to innocent victims? I was just about to become a million dollar crotch model!
Homer,Please tell me I'm still beautiful!
Homer,"Well, family, we should be proud. We took on corporate America and broke even."
Homer,Mmm. Sandwich.
Homer,What?
Homer,"Keep your pants on, Marge. It's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through ""book fairs"" and ""silent auctions."" And parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits ""reply all"" to everything!"
Homer,"Oh, that's fine then."
Homer,"I'll say it, Marge, it's in Hell! The Inferno! Perdition! Arizona without the golf!"
Homer,Nooo!
Homer,Hm. That is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.
Homer,"Yeah, I'll be sure to take a look at that."
Homer,"No, boy. I want you to do it."
Homer,"Bart, you went to Hell and came back a winner, like Jesus. Now come on, boy! Pull me apart like string cheese."
Homer,Which one's yours?
Homer,Nice.
Homer,Stupid blood. Asking me for a favor.
Homer,"Ooh Marge, that was fast. Yeah, that's it, baby. Grab my chest with your cold icy hands."
Homer,The bed is lifting me! The elevator at work can't even do that! I demand you put me down right after the sex!
Homer,"All right, show yourselves in the name of this book!"
Homer,The power of Chrysler compels you!
Homer,"Hey... if you're Homer Simpson, show me your driver's license."
Homer,He is me!
Homer,"Why is it always me? I work twelve hours a week, you know!"
Homer,"So... yeah. Things aren't perfect with the missus and me. And by the way, nice melons."
Homer,I can't believe you wasted our money on fruit.
Homer,Can you be more specific?
Homer,"There's no reason to be jealous, it's just younger you."
Homer,"Well, hello."
Homer,A ghost!
Homer,Don't yell at me! I'm a double widower! But I can handle all the ghosts you can float at me!
Homer,"I think he gets it. See, he--"
Homer,Ow! Ooh! What the? Mmm! I smell toast!
Homer,Ooh... pork chops with gravy!
Homer,Hey... but today's not Pork Chop Tuesday... or Gravy Thursday.
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,"Oh, I love Canadian on Canadian violence. Oh baby, this is so great! Thank you so much!"
Homer,Wait a minute -- that's not something people really feel. What's going on?
Homer,"No, Marge... no! You can't invite a couple of Riddlers to stay in the Bat Cave!"
Homer,"Hm, oh honey, one teensy problem with this plan. I'm a teensy bit concerned about them smoking around the children. You know, their lungs are so teensy."
Homer,"And if you trust them, I trust them too."
Homer,Safety first.
Homer,"Bad news, bears. Forecast calls for nothing but rain."
Homer,"If you fall asleep with them, will you even burn to death?"
Homer,Ha! I gotcha!
Homer,You can't resist smoking in the house any more than I can resist drinking in the car.
Homer,And now I banish you from paradise! I'm glad I never bothered to learn which one of you is which.
Homer,I know just the place.
Homer,Lisa! Motorcade!
Homer,Woo-hoo!
Homer,"Woo-hoo? I don't know... ""Fracking"" is one of those scary Lisa words."
Homer,"Thanks, Charlie. Maybe fracking isn't so bad."
Homer,"I'm not screwing you over. No, uh... I'm not screwing you over. I'm not screwing you over."
Homer,Some folks will tell you that fracking's no good. But what they don't tell you is... hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.
Homer,And all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what you're selling: beer.
Homer,Authentic Italian food.
Homer,Useless left-handed crap.
Homer,Magical nonsense.
Homer,Expensive toys for grownups they don't open or play with.
Homer,Pornography and nachos.
Homer,High-quality Spanish language programming.
Homer,High-quality methamphetamines.
Homer,"Laundry. Homework. Pranks. Poop, poop and poop."
Homer,"Because I've never gotten a promotion before. Once I thought I had, but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing. So judge me all you want."
Homer,"Good, judge away."
Homer,Everyone who signs over their mineral rights to Mr. Burns gets five thousand dollars!
Homer,"Mr. Burns, we did it! Everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights."
Homer,Excellent?
Homer,Well... one.
Homer,Oh baby...
Homer,"Well, I'm no Carl when it comes to this stuff. But I ain't no Lenny neither. And I would say... no matter how much you try to keep things casual, someone always gets hurt."
Homer,Glad I could be of help...
Homer,Marge? Why didn't you sign?
Homer,Marge Simpson... I'm as mad at you as you usually are at me.
Homer,"Oh yeah, great. Great, Marge. Great work. Thanks to you, Springfield will never be a natural gas boom town. And like all boom towns it would have lasted forever."
Homer,"Was on fire. Was. I finally get a job I was good at, and now I have to give it up."
Homer,"Wait, Mr. Burns! I'm here to man up -- it was all my wife's fault! Sometimes I think she and I have nothing in common."
Homer,"Marge likes sushi, I like gum that squirts in your mouth. She's into romantic comedies, I like movies where there's only one day a year when murder is legal. Yep, Marge and I see the world in totally different ways."
Homer,So you don't miss that politics lady at all?
Homer,Killdozers.
Homer,Gravy Thursday.
Homer,"You don't know anything about hydraulic fracturing! You've just been brainwashed by liberal TV shows who use ""fracking"" as an easy bad guy. But it can save this country!"
Homer,Wait... I finally get what you're saying. Fracking is great. But the only place it should ever happen is in other people's towns!
Homer,"Hey, a couch is a couch."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,What the hell was that?!
Homer,"Relax, Marge. It's probably just Homer comin' home late from Moe's."
Homer,The eyes in that picture are following me.
Homer,Isn't all great art kind of a mirror?
Homer,"We'd better send the dog down. Come on. Here's your chance to protect us, boy. Come on."
Homer,Stupid dog!
Homer,"We'll have to set a trap, bait. I mean, Bart."
Homer,"All set. When he starts gnawing at you, I'll whack him with this broom."
Homer,Don't drink my loved ones!
Homer,A robot with a catchphrase!
Homer,"Okay, so what are you?"
Homer,Prove it. What happens to Homer Simpson in the future?
Homer,Oh. My. God. He's telling the truth. I have to take you to our civic leaders.
Homer,"Listen, I-I know you're a robot and incapable of emotion..."
Homer,"Uh, look, I just wanna ask... can we be friends?"
Homer,You're the only guy I know with less hair than me.
Homer,"Yeah! Hey, uh, what's the robot version of bromance?"
Homer,You future guys have a word for everything... pal.
Homer,My ears are burning.
Homer,A boxing glove!
Homer,But we bowled together.
Homer,You don't have to announce it. Just do it quietly and blame the dog.
Homer,What the?
Homer,"I'll explain. Okay, it starts free, right?"
Homer,"Then you visit your friend's game, and he's got this awesome candy mansion..."
Homer,"...and you're like ""ninety-nine cents? You bet I'd like one..."""
Homer,And that's why I owe Clash of Candies twenty thousand dollars. Here we are.
Homer,"Marge, I'd like you to meet Leela and Fry."
Homer,Start with Flanders... start with Flanders...
Homer,Who is that?!
Homer,We're here.
Homer,My bowling buddy.
Homer,Why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little...
Homer,Prove it. When's your birthday?
Homer,Ha! February has no twenty-third!
Homer,I was voted Employee of the Month as an April Fool's Day joke. Why you little... why you little...
Homer,"Hey, I haven't had a drink in a thousand years."
Homer,What the?
Homer,"Aww, I will treasure this forever."
Homer,"Good night, friend. You'll always have a special place here with us."
Homer,"SIMPSONS, IN THE / FUTURE -- SPACE JOKES! / FLYING THROUGH TOWN / WHAT ARE THOSE TUBES / I WONDER WHAT / ICE CREAM'S LIKE NOW / MAYBE IT'S HOT / OR SOME NEW TEMPERATURE THEY INVENTED... That's it, we're done."
Homer,You wanna talk about it?
Homer,"Oh, thank you."
Homer,A haircut? Let me see!
Homer,I won't laugh at you. Let's see--
Homer,Look at me! I'm Bart!
Homer,"Marge, please don't say anything. It never makes a difference and then the teachers give us stink-eye during the school fairs."
Homer,What camping trip?
Homer,"Oh, uh... you told me not to do it a year ago. Remember?"
Homer,You're right. No one could be expected to remember something from a year ago. Certainly not me. Pass the gravy?
Homer,"Hey, there's always room at Buzzard's Roost."
Homer,"Excuse me, but grass is poking through."
Homer,Poking through.
Homer,Poking through.
Homer,"Oh, Marge, I can't stand it when you cry at dinner. The pork chops look traumatized. The mashed potatoes can't stand watch. Even the children seem upset. So trust me, I will come through for you, baby."
Homer,Not you.
Homer,"So, what do you say, Marge?"
Homer,And I want you to believe me too. Isn't it great how much we agree?
Homer,"Compared to the rest of these people, yeah."
Homer,"Look, I really need a campsite. My wife is making sandwiches!"
Homer,What about Mosquito Cove?
Homer,Skunk Canyon?
Homer,Ooh! How 'bout the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers?
Homer,"Hello? Hello? This is Homer Simpson! 742 Evergreen Terrace, looking for a place for my kids and me! And my pretty, pretty wife!"
Homer,"You know, alarm code three six seven nine. Three six seven nine!"
Homer,"Marge, I have a confession to make about this trip."
Homer,"Once again, I've been saved from any consequences. It'll keep happening till one day I create a mess so enormous it can't be cleaned up. Thanks, boy."
Homer,A CAMPING WE WILL GO...
Homer,A PLACE THAT'S FILLED WITH SUN AND SAND / A DESERT STEAMPUNK DISNEYLAND / KEEP EXPECTATIONS LOWWW... / SWING LOW SWEET CHARIOT...
Homer,"Homer Simpson, I love you."
Homer,Cars shaped like cupcakes!
Homer,All camping is pointless. You drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds. I guess what I'm trying to say is: where's Maggie?
Homer,"Uh, listen here, Desert Arnaz. Homer Simpson knows how to pitch a tent."
Homer,"Hey man, can I bum a tent?"
Homer,Hey Marge!
Homer,We got a new tent from a guy who O.D.'d!
Homer,"Aw, let me get a picture of that."
Homer,This place is great. Just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses!
Homer,Get... in... the tent!
Homer,Just like I planned.
Homer,I understand. I already signed up for this place next year. I Gave my form and two hundred dollars cash to that dude.
Homer,I'll take those.
Homer,Beware the butterfly's sting! What the?
Homer,...and that's the terrifying tale of how the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche.
Homer,"Lisa, how many times have I told you to bow down to our corporate overlords?"
Homer,It's like some kind of guitar central.
Homer,Stig. You've got a name that's not a name.
Homer,"Oh, I don't have what it takes to play guitar. I mean, I'm no Joe Walsh in the brains department."
Homer,What the rock?
Homer,I did a lick?
Homer,Oh my god... I'm amazing.
Homer,I'm not set at all.
Homer,"This is embarrassing to admit, Stig, but I hadn't even thought about gels."
Homer,MUSIC! BEAUTIFUL MUSIC!
Homer,"Beautiful music, baby."
Homer,Sure it is. You know I've always loved laying things down. Grooves are just the latest.
Homer,"I feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players. Like what's his name from The Who. Or that guy from Led Zeppelin who wasn't Page, Plant or Bonham. Those are the only two I know for sure."
Homer,"Oh yeah, and you know what's the great thing is about music? It's so easy."
Homer,So easy.
Homer,I don't know guys. I'm not sure I'm feeling this. The bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument.
Homer,I almost forgot the most important thing.
Homer,"Great practice, guys. What do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day?"
Homer,"Oh... yeah, Apu, I'm sure you're a great singer. But the balance of the band is really delicate right now, and we're not really looking for a ""world music"" vibe. No disrespect to world music. I love world music."
Homer,"That sounds nothing like terrible, terrible world music."
Homer,"Guys, are you feeling this? Are you feeling this?"
Homer,We are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families. We are now a cover band. And we shall be called... Covercraft. Because we play covers and this is our craft.
Homer,"That was not my intent. Okay, Covercraft: hands in."
Homer,Cover...
Homer,"R ""O"" ""K"" ""C""."
Homer,"Okay, this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new."
Homer,"Apu, what's wrong?"
Homer,I still want one.
Homer,"Buddy, buddy. Think of it this way: you're not singing in front of all those people, you're alone at the Kwik-E-Mart in the middle of the night. You just wear this on stage, and everything will be fine."
Homer,"Well son, I do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs I could write... down the names of and then cover. But then I remember: I'm just a regular guy, jamming with my buds."
Homer,Yep. It's all about the music... and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that. Pretty unforeseen...
Homer,"Guys, I really need your honesty here. At the Squidport Senior Jamboree... was I too in the pocket?"
Homer,How?
Homer,What kind of erotic asphyxiation?
Homer,Oh...
Homer,"I think I can answer for Apu. He's flattered, but the small-time success of Covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted."
Homer,"Apu has a rich life here in Springfield: a store full of great products, a lovely him-type wife, and eight super kids: Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu, Gheet, Pria, Uma, Poonam, Sashi--"
Homer,Not me. I'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune.
Homer,I want his fame and fortune so much! Why must the Lords of Rock be so cruel?!
Homer,Sammy Hagar? You're not dead.
Homer,It's something you make sketches about.
Homer,I'm not jealous. I'm envious. Jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. Envy is wanting what someone else has. What I feel is envy.
Homer,You know what? Apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. We're gonna be like Genesis after Peter Gabriel left.
Homer,"Phil Collins-era Genesis is not as good, huh? ""No Reply at All,"" ""Land of Confusion,"" ""Throwing it All Away,"" ""Illegal Alien,"" ""I Can't Dance,"" and I'm sure I don't need to mention... ""Invisible Touch!"""
Homer,What? So you can also get famous and bail on us? You're out of the band!
Homer,"Oh, so you're sticking up for Yoko here? Looks like I've got another Yoko on my hands."
Homer,Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! All you Yokos are out of the band!
Homer,Do I sound okay?
Homer,They're not juicy. My licks are dry. Dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.
Homer,"Well it's not enough anymore. When something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse. Look it up, it's called physics."
Homer,"Oh, you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star?"
Homer,I'll never have a per diem.
Homer,Apu wouldn't be able to sing a note if I didn't help him get over his stage fright with his Kwik-E-Mart shirt...
Homer,"Backstage pass, you just became a payback rage pass."
Homer,"Look at all this rock star dressing room stuff. What a sellout. Cheese plate -- oh, sorry, cubed cheese plate, lemon tea, probably for his throat..."
Homer,Let's see how he performs in front of all those people without his magic-people-performing-in-front-of shirt.
Homer,"I'm sorry, Apu. I thought you were living your dream life, so naturally I wanted to ruin it. But now I know things stink, so I'm okay with it."
Homer,"Kwik-E-Mart hot dog, eh?"
Homer,HOPIN'! HOPIN'!
Homer,"I'll be right home, honey. I've just got to lock down the reactor for the evening."
Homer,Tight as a drum.
Homer,Mr. Scrooge!
Homer,"Headin' home, baby."
Homer,Nothing's gonna stop me now.
Homer,Maybe a drink will help me with my driving.
Homer,I'd better be heading home... to my family... enjoy your evening... with your wonderful... uh... neon sign...
Homer,"Hey, um, you gonna be okay?"
Homer,Okay! Okay! I'll stay for one beer.
Homer,But I promised Marge.
Homer,"Okay, okay!"
Homer,"Hey, what the--"
Homer,I am so late!
Homer,"Marge, think about what you're saying. It's Sir Isaac Newton's birthday!"
Homer,"Yeah?! Well, good luck assembling all those toys without me!"
Homer,The ghost of Marge Future!
Homer,"Moe, what are you doing?"
Homer,"Hey, pal. Can't believe you have to work Christmas Eve."
Homer,Maybe Marge would forgive me if I won the lotto. Give me a scratcher.
Homer,Gimme another one.
Homer,Gimme another one.
Homer,Gimme another one.
Homer,Gimme another one.
Homer,Gimme another one.
Homer,Gimme another one.
Homer,"Yeah, but doesn't the money go to schools?"
Homer,"Aw, thanks for your honesty, Apu. Is there any other product in the store you'd like to warn me about?"
Homer,Wow.
Homer,I don't wanna ruin the magic and I certainly
Homer,Next year... this is... your job.
Homer,... ...
Homer,... Ooh!... ...
Homer,Even the anchor store's closed.
Homer,Any uplifting holiday movies?
Homer,I guess I'll take the Concentration Camp one.
Homer,"Well, if I've gotta spend Christmas Eve alone, at least no one will see me."
Homer,"What if I left now, and gave you guys my popcorn and soda?"
Homer,Flanders? What are you doing here?
Homer,"Say Flanders, with all the hard luck you've had, how do you stay so happy? And don't say ""Jesus."""
Homer,"Flanders, are you crying?"
Homer,"Listen. Could I buy a left-handed uh... I don't know, eyelash curler?"
Homer,Um. Maybe.
Homer,Because Jerk-ass Homer has become Ass-jerk Homer.
Homer,"You're all right, Stupid Flanders. You're all right."
Homer,I made everyone happy but me. Some Christmas. Feliz Navidad.
Homer,What the?
Homer,The Nutcracker! Every child's favorite Christmas character! Is this a dream?
Homer,"Man, you are a nutcracker. But I've learned something tonight: you know how everyone hates being with their family on Christmas? Well, being without them is worse. Can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break?"
Homer,What are you doing here?
Homer,Oh my God. Is that girl really doing that?
Homer,"Mmm, load-bearing wall."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,This party's great. But all I wish is that I was drinking a beer with my kids right now.
Homer,Hm?
Homer,"Oh Marge, you found me! You always find me. Now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot."
Homer,"Oh, well, I've been faking the noise 'cause you deserve the best."
Homer,Thank you magical creatures of the mall.
Homer,You have all taught me a Christmas message I'll never forget: the place to get drunk is at home.
Homer,What the? This isn't Halloween!
Homer,No.
Homer,No!
Homer,Okay! We're there! Finally!
Homer,Damn technology!
Homer,Turn it off!
Homer,"Ooh, spot!"
Homer,"Don't worry, this time I'm gonna write down where I parked."
Homer,Look! I see land!
Homer,"You planted that on me, man!"
Homer,"Fine. But I'm not paying for the insurance. Oh, what the hell, give me the insurance."
Homer,"well, that's it. We've visited every section including Churro County, Toonton Abbey...but you know what we haven't had here? I'll tell you: fun. The kind of fun attractive families have in commercials."
Homer,"I just wanna sit down, but the line for the bench is too long."
Homer,"Lisa, those maps were drawn by the first explorers of this theme park, hundreds of years ago. Let's go."
Homer,Come on! Start this thing! I'm not impressed.
Homer,This is so fake.
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,Prove it.
Homer,What the? This isn't Halloween.
Homer,That's good.
Homer,"Hey, Captain Squid! If you really want to be nice to us, how 'bout some snacks?"
Homer,Potato chips!
Homer,Stupid kid! You ruin every trip!
Homer,Let me just... there you are... like new... not a freak of nature...
Homer,Look at all these knobs and buttons. They are clearly a superior race. But maybe that means they'll be nice to us.
Homer,That's right. Pick the only two times in history where things got messy.
Homer,Wow. This place is completely alien but everything's in English. Just like Canada.
Homer,Can I turn my phone on?
Homer,I say we take this bucket home!
Homer,To Earth!
Homer,Come on... come on... you son of a--
Homer,"Yeah, you really went with the purple theme."
Homer,"Wait, are you telling me we're prisoners in this cage?!"
Homer,"See, Marge?"
Homer,You're the doctor.
Homer,Fine.
Homer,This isn't a happy thing!
Homer,Okay.
Homer,What the?!
Homer,"Well, we haven't heard from Maggie yet."
Homer,What the? Pfft. Gibberish! Pure gibberish!
Homer,"'Tis a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before."
Homer,"That kid's got talent, but c'mon!"
Homer,"I get it, Lisa. I finally get it."
Homer,I'd like rabbit. Lots of rabbit.
Homer,Fondue? Welcome to a faculty dinner party in nineteen seventy-nine.
Homer,Yes! This mysterious tube can only lead somewhere good. So long you stupid slobbering... what the?
Homer,And away we go!
Homer,"So, what do you eat, space broccoli?"
Homer,Where are you taking me?
Homer,Why are they dancing? Shouldn't they be making weapons?
Homer,"...but perhaps Earth's greatest achievement is moon rocks. Oh, and the golden age of radio."
Homer,What about my family?
Homer,"Sex mate? Clearly you've never been married. But it's great, I'm telling you."
Homer,"Well, it is a great party."
Homer,"Suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting."
Homer,What the?!
Homer,Oh who am I kidding? I couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family. I'm going back to save them.
Homer,You forgot to glaze me!
Homer,I think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.
Homer,"Glaze, please."
Homer,What's that?
Homer,It does look delicious.
Homer,Don't you people realize your queen is dying?
Homer,"Captain's log, Star date: six-five-eight-four-eight point two. After successfully conquering the Rigelians..."
Homer,I have such a big ass.
Homer,"Set a course, Mr. Maggie. Anywhere but home."
Homer,WALKIN' DOWN A CORRIDOR / USIN' BOTH MY FEET / WISH I WAS IN FLORIDOR / NOW I WILL REPEAT / OH I'M WALKIN' DOWN A CORRIDOR / USIN' BOTH MY FEET...
Homer,"We sure will miss your, your, um, uh -- what'd you do again?"
Homer,"But, wait a minute! That's my job!"
Homer,That would explain a lot. But why did you do it?
Homer,"No, please! All I'm asking you to do is stay twenty-one more years!"
Homer,Stressful. Do you see how loose my tie is?
Homer,For the first time I actually had to do my job.
Homer,"And Marge, I've got this weird new feeling in my stomach. A little sour and a little sick."
Homer,They have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.
Homer,"Look, I don't have time for childish games. If I don't do my job, atoms go boom!"
Homer,"Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Can I get a four fifty-five wakeup call?"
Homer,It's called a double standard. One of the bedrocks of parenting.
Homer,"No. Marge, if I lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. Oh, I guess, as a fallback, I could direct films like Angelina Jolie. How many properties do we have an option on?"
Homer,What?! When were you gonna tell me?
Homer,When?!
Homer,"The circus? Hmmm, I haven't been to the circus since I was a kid."
Homer,"Okay, Marge. We can go to the circus. Maybe I can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion."
Homer,Dammit! This circus Wi-Fi is a joke!
Homer,How can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking?
Homer,What kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!
Homer,The early bird gets the shaft!
Homer,Oh my God. What if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us? Maybe there's better Wi-Fi in the freak tent.
Homer,"'Scuse me, pardon me, what the Hell?"
Homer,"Oh! Finally! The business call I've been waiting for! Hello, this is--"
Homer,"Come on, kids! There's nothing you'd be interested in here."
Homer,"Eh, they'll grow back."
Homer,Oh for God's-- now? Do you have to?
Homer,Fine. But I'll be amazed if I'm astounded.
Homer,"Hey, is that time right? I have a deadline in an hour and a half!"
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"Ooh, patter!"
Homer,"No, but we're having fun trying. Wait, I mean three."
Homer,"Look, can we get to the point? I'm stack parked. Did you hear me? Stack..."
Homer,No I'm not.
Homer,No I'm not.
Homer,No I'm not.
Homer,Yes you are.
Homer,Yes you are.
Homer,Yeah you are too.
Homer,"I know you are but what am I, infinity plus one! Jinx!"
Homer,Ew! Gross!
Homer,Help... help me.
Homer,Psych!
Homer,Oops.
Homer,Ask for boogers on Bart's half!
Homer,"Get the ball, boy! C'mon!"
Homer,"Go get it, boy!"
Homer,"Go get it, boy!"
Homer,"Go get it, boy!"
Homer,Hey! Ow! Ow! I thought you were my best friend! Ow! Ow!
Homer,"Um, Mrs. Simpson?"
Homer,I'd be too nervous. Have you noticed that she's kinda hot?
Homer,I'm ready to go to school.
Homer,I'm not? Cool! Am I sick?
Homer,"'Cause if I'm sick, I get to stay home and make s'mores. All I need is graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
Homer,"...did I say graham crackers?... chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
Homer,Can I play?
Homer,I'm beat.
Homer,Today was fun.
Homer,Why you little--
Homer,"I'll eat in bed. Not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna... Oh, and TV would be on. Loud."
Homer,"Pff. Wife? Three kids? Steady job? If I did, I'd secretly be very sad. You could tell by how much I would eat and drink and just sit on the couch."
Homer,Yeah. Thank God that never happened.
Homer,Lisa...
Homer,...your Ma says I should do something with you. Need some help with your homework?
Homer,Wanna see me make a muscle?
Homer,"Well, that's everything I know that girls like."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO-DOO-DOO D-DOO-DOO / DOO DOO DOO D-DOO-DOO DOO-DOO-DOO D-DOO D-DOO-DOO D-DOO DOO D-DOO DOO
Homer,"D-DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO! Y'know, you're the closest thing I've ever had to a brother."
Homer,Change back to what?
Homer,Bloated corpse under the water. I'd say he's been there a few months at least. Interesting the way his lips move just like mine. Why do you ask?
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,What do we do next? What do we do next?
Homer,"Bye, Bart. Stay ten forever."
Homer,- parked! I hate stack parking! Wait! Where am I? This isn't the circus! It's an amusement park! The furthest thing from a circus!
Homer,"Marge, sweetie, I'm not gonna lie. I must have tied one on at Moe's. If you have it in your heart, could you forgive me and totally blame my friends?"
Homer,Ooh! I've missed you too.
Homer,What the? Lasagna in bed?!
Homer,"Y'know, I used to have this friend... I told him all my dreams. Really, really great kid."
Homer,The best. Wonder what ever happened to him.
Homer,"You know, boy, I'm not sure I can strangle you anymore. I'm gonna try something new."
Homer,"What do you say, boy? Wanna split the lasagna?"
Homer,Why you little...?!
Homer,It's good to be back.
Homer,Can we cuddle for a little while?
Homer,It is!
Homer,"Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. Fighting him is like kicking George Washington in his wooden nuts!"
Homer,"This means war! Boy, bring my toupee!"
Homer,"Go ahead, boy."
Homer,"Uh, Pittsburgh thirty-five, Dallas thirty-one!"
Homer,"Ha-ha! Stupid eagle! It wasn't the mouse we were after, it was you! Marge! Preheat the oven!"
Homer,You-- get-- out!
Homer,"I've got him cornered, boy! Bag him up!"
Homer,"Not so majestic in a trash bag, are ya?!"
Homer,Oopsie.
Homer,Seems almost a shame I'm gonna have to bang you against a wall till you die.
Homer,Um...
Homer,"Okay. Bart, think of a name. Make it great. Insanely, unbelievably great!"
Homer,Perfect! Just like when we let you name Maggie.
Homer,Bye!
Homer,"Oh my God! Brace yourselves, family. We're about to meet a being with intelligence far beyond ours. Boy, get me my baseball bat."
Homer,Die!
Homer,"You're the guy who put wheels on luggage? Oh, bless you! Bless you!"
Homer,"And now he's landed in our yard, on my son's bike and on our mailman's leg."
Homer,"Mmm, raisin detra."
Homer,"Hey Elon, if you're interested, you could come to the nuclear plant where I work tomorrow."
Homer,"Great. And if anyone asks where I am, just cover for me."
Homer,"Fine. We'll both go. And if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say, ""protons."""
Homer,So do you get satellite radio cheaper in space?
Homer,"""Ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free."" It's as old as the Bible."
Homer,Ditto.
Homer,"Aw, man, I wish those were white meatballs."
Homer,"Uh... don't tase me, bro. Chocolate rain!"
Homer,What about the chocolate?
Homer,Um...
Homer,I gotcha!
Homer,Well duh!
Homer,"Suggestion for the ""suggestion box."""
Homer,"Be my guest, but I seriously doubt the old man ever reads 'em."
Homer,"Careful, Elon. He's not as kindly as he appears."
Homer,So... what kind of lunch do you pack?
Homer,"Wow. Elon, you're like Willie Wonka without the underpaid munchkins."
Homer,"Uh, I'd like to offer you something... but all I've got is coffee... with cream!"
Homer,"Come on, I want cream! Give it up! cream and sugar are one thing too many!"
Homer,"Wow. Wow. Between your genius and my nothing, we make a great team. Come on, give me a hug."
Homer,"Well, I'm not one for just talking."
Homer,Does that drone do date nights with the wife?
Homer,SINCE YOU CAME DOWN FROM THE SKY
Homer,"Car, go park at work so people think I'm there."
Homer,You really came back from that Tommy John surgery.
Homer,More of what?
Homer,"No. It's Elon. I don't care how much he likes me, I don't wanna be friends with him anymore. None of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out. Sky pies are lie pies! Of all the planets in the universe, why did he have to come to this one?"
Homer,How do you break up with a guy?
Homer,"Wow, you're good at that."
Homer,Oh my God! Oh my God! You saved my life. Which is gonna make what I'm about to say even more awkward...
Homer,"Elon, Elon, Elon! I want to say something to you and I don't want you to be inspired by it. I want you to listen."
Homer,I don't want to be with you anymore.
Homer,"I could say it's the being shot at or the flat, emotionless way you talk or the fact that PayPal was my idea and I was just about to do it when you came out with it... but really it's that this town isn't ready for you, and neither am I."
Homer,It's on your face too!
Homer,"Well, I've saved you one last prize from the Cracker Jack box that is my brain. Use it as you will."
Homer,On a Miami Dolphins helmet the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.
Homer,When you're sixteen I'll drive you to Cincinnati. And you'll see what there is to see.
Homer,Nothing.
Homer,The little dolphin is also wearing a helmet... Wearing a helmet... Wearing a helmet..
Homer,I met a guy. A wonderful guy.
Homer,Boy. Sure is nice not to be the one on the horse for a change.
Homer,Simpler time.
Homer,What are you doing?
Homer,Artists.
Homer,I saved us seats!
Homer,"Thank you, roll of masking tape!"
Homer,Gonna be a tight fit.
Homer,"Well, not Maggie."
Homer,"Okay, okay. Standing O or die!"
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Stop laughing at me!
Homer,Stop fearing me!
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,Please keep spinning it. I don't wanna look at it.
Homer,Can't you say something to make me feel better?
Homer,"Fine. I got it. Starting right now, a year-long juice cleanse; every morning, I get a colonic, and I sleep in a sauna every night."
Homer,"It's not about health, Marge. It's about going crazy."
Homer,What the?
Homer,Hmmm.
Homer,This is it.
Homer,"I'm sorry, I thought you were Over-feeders Anonymous."
Homer,So... you guys are proud of what you are?
Homer,Do you guys serve snacks?
Homer,"I have so many questions for you. First of all, is this floor reinforced?"
Homer,"You know, maybe I shouldn't be here. I promised my wife I'd lose weight."
Homer,"Ooh, labels."
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,"Ooh, like Fat Albert."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,I am big.
Homer,I have a beauty of a sort to some.
Homer,"Ditto. You know I've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and I think you just might be the guy."
Homer,"Marge, kids! Tonight was a turning point in my life."
Homer,"No, Marge! You have to listen! That place you sent me to changed my life!"
Homer,"They taught me that I don't need to lose weight, I should just be proud of what I am."
Homer,"It's not what you think. His name is Albert and he taught me not to buy into the lies taught by ""big nutrition."""
Homer,"Marge, you're my wife of ten years and I love you. But I must observe the teachings of this man I just met tonight. Now, the first thing I have to do is make amends... with the bathroom scale."
Homer,"I'm so sorry I threw you across the room and called you a liar. When you told me I was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me. It was a poem you were writing about my potential. I'm gonna start celebrating my size and I need you with me as a partner. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to talk to the broken porch swing."
Homer,"From now on, you guys can no longer say these hateful words."
Homer,"Chubby, chunky, blobbo, slobbo, Fat Bastard, Michelin Man, Stay-puft, chumbawamba, It is balloon!, Papa Grandé, Augustus Gloop, Beached Whale, Big Boned, Wisconsin Skinny, Butterball, Dumptruck, Jelly Belly, Pudgy Wudgy, Lard Ass, Blubberino, Buddha Belly, Hurry Eat Tubman, One Ton Soup, Blob Saget, Chub Hub, Calvin Cool Whip, Manfred Manboobs, 21 Lump Street, Walking Before Picture, Fatso, Harvey Milk Chocolate, Obese Want Cannoli, Mahatma Gumbo, Salvador Deli, Elmer Pantry, K.F.C. And The Sponge Cake Band, Snackie Onassis... The Foodie Blues, Hoagie Carmichael and Wide Load."
Homer,"Good. Good. By which I mean bad, bad."
Homer,We never dreamed.
Homer,"Sorry, fellas. There's a movement I have to join. I've learned there's something more important than drinking: eating."
Homer,Right here.
Homer,"Excuse me, pardon me, coming through."
Homer,"Comin' back, 'scuse me, pardon me..."
Homer,There we go. Comin' up... what can I do for you?
Homer,"Guys, I'm comin' back in. Suck in your guts."
Homer,I was distinctly promised no math!
Homer,"Marge, it's not your fault that you can't win against a superior being like Albert."
Homer,"But Marge, I don't want you to ever stop caring about me."
Homer,"Marge, I believe you're forgetting America's greatest wartime wheelchair-bound leader: Professor X of the X-Men."
Homer,"I've never written an eulogy before, but this time I did. Unfortunately, I left it at home."
Homer,"Thanks, lady."
Homer,What Albert taught us is that all people have pride and no group should ever be insulted. He knew what was important was how you lived your life every day...till he was taken from us too soon at the age of...
Homer,"Twenty-three?! People, for God's sake, join a gym."
Homer,"Marge, I'm sorry I was proud of myself."
Homer,"It will never happen again. Now come on, let's walk home."
Homer,Can I ask you something? What is it that keeps you with me?
Homer,"And because you love me, I will not stop yo-yo dieting till I get it right."
Homer,At last.
Homer,Marge! Stop that crazy thing!
Homer,I'm not spending my precious Saturday chauffeuring those over-privileged kids to a better life than I ever had.
Homer,"Moe, quick! Beer me before I answer the phone!"
Homer,I need it now!
Homer,"Hey, Marge. I'm supposed to help drive the kids? Oh, man, I wish I knew that sooner, but I just had a beer."
Homer,Woo hoo! Off the hook!
Homer,"Yeah, while you're at it can you pick me up some beer?"
Homer,Hey Moe... I'll take care of the bar. You did me a favor today.
Homer,"Man, Moe's barely got two nickels to rub together."
Homer,There's no guys! We haven't made any money.
Homer,We don't look at you that way.
Homer,Good ol' Dae Ho. Used to give me the pickles off his sandwich. And all I had to do was let him copy some keys.
Homer,That's where all the problems are!
Homer,"Look Moe, the least you could let me do is anything I want."
Homer,"Well, that's the logic. Where's the affection?"
Homer,Plant-watering guy.
Homer,All right.
Homer,What do I do now?
Homer,"Oh, all right."
Homer,"Well, you know people can kinda act like they're in grade school."
Homer,"You know, Moe, you're a real jerk. I didn't mind so much when it came with beer."
Homer,"Marge, which can makes me look cooler? The Drizzler or Mr. Drip?"
Homer,"Aw, your leaves are drooping. Here, let me turn that gloom into bloom."
Homer,Feminine?!
Homer,So good to be back.
Homer,'Cause boys are already on track to get all the good jobs. The Dirty Dozen? All guys. Twelve Angry Men? Men! The X-Men? Mostly men.
Homer,Not my department.
Homer,"Oh, uh, I will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal, using my greatest skill -- lunchroom trading. Shut your eyes."
Homer,"Okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!"
Homer,"Babysitting, eh? What do I know about kids?"
Homer,"Princess, why did you put on that coat? You're obviously cold. May I escort you to the radiator?"
Homer,"Uh, just a second. Hey, Marge. Yeah, I'm workin' late. Yep, special project."
Homer,"Sorry, Marge. But I am the royal babysitter. If I start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag!"
Homer,"I see. You want excitement. Princess, have you ever heard of Studio Fifty-Four, C-B-G-Bs, the Roxbury?"
Homer,All gone. But in their place we have five hundred channels of television. All awesome. Sit down and I'll show you.
Homer,"He's called ""The Bachelor."""
Homer,"All right, Princess. I'll take you to a place that's fun with a capital F."
Homer,Can I try it?
Homer,"Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it."
Homer,And you gave it to him?
Homer,Eight million?
Homer,Get outta here!
Homer,She's gone!
Homer,"Chief! Thank God! I was drinking at Moe's, and I lost an African princess!"
Homer,Yes! The prayer I forgot to say has been answered.
Homer,What the?
Homer,"Guys, thanks for bailing me out. But I still have a huge problem."
Homer,"Um, yeah, sure. Hello, this is the princess. I'm with Homer Simpson and I do declare he's wonderful. Oh, that's right, I'm from South Africa. Fiddle dee dee."
Homer,Moe Szyslak!
Homer,This is the part of the fairytale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches TV!
Homer,"Uh, may I speak to you, Majesty, father to father?"
Homer,There was beer involved. I have two daughters. And I've learned you have to let them go their own way. Even the one-year-old.
Homer,"And the older one, I can't tell her what to do. And she's only twelve."
Homer,See what I mean? Always an argument.
Homer,But the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them...
Homer,"...uh, because you want them to grow..."
Homer,...and because you can't strangle a girl.
Homer,"Oh, God gets your prayers, but he just clicks delete without reading them, like email updates from LinkedIn."
Homer,"Go, go make magic. You just go."
Homer,Revue...
Homer,Oh boy oh boy.
Homer,One AM lovin' and two AM steak? Night marriage rules! I guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue.
Homer,What are the skits about?
Homer,How do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?
Homer,"Nice. You know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs. Tell me about one."
Homer,"You got yourself one hell of a show, Marge. One hell of a show."
Homer,"Marge? Some casino guys have me, and they want the money you took from them, or else."
Homer,"Just tell me one thing, Marge. Why did you lose faith in the revue? I mean, ""Cats and Dogs"" writes itself. CATS AND DOGS ON CAPITAL HILL / THEY DON'T GET ALONG AND NEVER WILL"
Homer,"CATS AND DOGS, SQUABBLE'S NEVER ENDING / EVEN WITH SO MUCH LEGISLATION PENDING!"
Homer,"Well, I was taking a moment to enjoy my after dinner night cap..."
Homer,If anything happens to Marge... we'll all be orphans!
Homer,I'm comin' for ya baby!
Homer,Have you seen this woman? Have you? Have you seen my wife?
Homer,Do you know where she is?
Homer,"All right, as long as it's just questions."
Homer,Are you gonna put my head in a vise?
Homer,Stole? How is counting cards stealing?
Homer,Is it even cheating?
Homer,"I don't get it. Football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. Why can't I just remember which cards have been played?"
Homer,I knew you had a vise! I knew it!
Homer,No deal!
Homer,No! An injustice has gone on here for too long.
Homer,I'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards. They're just playing the game by the rules!
Homer,On a beautiful night like tonight... how could I not?
Homer,There's no time to be careful.
Homer,We're late.
Homer,"Hey, Norman. How's it going? So you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. How ya doing, Fred? Excuse me, Fred."
Homer,Pardon my galoshes.
Homer,"Oh, it's Lisa. That's ours."
Homer,How many grades does this school have?
Homer,Who shall I say is calling?
Homer,It's your sister.
Homer,"What? Why? Oh, yeah. Hello Patty, hello Selma. How was your trip?"
Homer,"Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet?"
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"Marge, where's the extension cord?"
Homer,Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas so much.
Homer,...Every year.
Homer,A what!
Homer,"Yeah. If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance."
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,Who's this?
Homer,"This is her sister, isn't it?"
Homer,"Okay, kids. Prepare to be dazzled. Marge! Turn on the juice!"
Homer,"What do you think, kids?"
Homer,"What is it, Flanders?"
Homer,"It's too bright. That Flanders, what a big show-off."
Homer,"Spill it, Marge. Where have you been hiding the Christmas money?"
Homer,Oh! Big jar this year.
Homer,Mm-hmm... Mmm-hmm... Mmm-hmm...
Homer,Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
Homer,"Oh, thank God for the big jar."
Homer,Hey! What's with this?
Homer,"It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone."
Homer,"Oh, yeah my Christmas bonus. How silly of me. This'll be the best Christmas yet. The best any family ever had. Heh-heh."
Homer,"Oh. I love you, Marge."
Homer,"Oh, good. Because I do love you and I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping."
Homer,"Marge, well, let me be honest with you."
Homer,Well... I want to do the Christmas shopping this year.
Homer,"Marge, Marge, Marge. Let's see. Oooh, look! Pantyhose. Practical and alluring. A six-pack... Oh! Only four ninety nine."
Homer,"Oooh... pads of paper. I bet Bart can think of a million things to do with these. That just leaves little Maggie. Oh, look, a little squeak-toy. . It says it's for dogs, but she can't read..."
Homer,"Hello, Flanders."
Homer,"Well, let's see."
Homer,They're all yours.
Homer,Gimme that!
Homer,So?
Homer,"Thanks, Moe."
Homer,"What's with the crazy getup, Barn?"
Homer,Wow. Can I do that?
Homer,What do you mean? All the time? Even when they're nuts?
Homer,"Oh, I certainly do."
Homer,"Huh, when do we get paid?"
Homer,"Dasher, Dancer..."
Homer,Prancer...
Homer,"Nixon, Comet, Cupid... Donna Dixon."
Homer,"And what would you like, little boy?"
Homer,Why you little eggheaded...!
Homer,"Oh, I knew that one, too."
Homer,"Not a word, Marge. I'm heading straight for the tub."
Homer,You both look well.
Homer,"Yeah, well, Merry Christmas."
Homer,And why is that?
Homer,"Well, I was just on my way out to get one."
Homer,No!
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"So, what do you think kids? Beauty, isn't it?"
Homer,That's an ornament.
Homer,"Ah, son, you don't need all that junk. I'm sure you've already got something much more important, a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you. Hey, I couldn't afford lunch. Gimme a bite of that donut."
Homer,"I will when Mrs. Claus's sisters get out of town. Thanks for listening, kid."
Homer,"What's your name, Bart... ner? -- Er -- Little partner?"
Homer,I'm Jolly Old Saint Nick.
Homer,"I want a word with you in Santa's Workshop, little boy. Cover for me, Elfie."
Homer,"Nobody knows. It's a secret. I didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas, I'd do anything."
Homer,"Now let's not get mushy, son. I still have a job to do."
Homer,"Hey, little ones, Santa's back. Ho! Ho!"
Homer,Arrgh! -- Damn it to...
Homer,"Ah, son. One day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday. Receiving a big fat check for a job well done."
Homer,"Come on, son. Let's go cash this baby and get presents for -- Thirteen bucks? Hey, wait a minute!"
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,But...
Homer,Santa?
Homer,Wait a minute...
Homer,But... but...
Homer,Thirteen bucks. We can't get anything for thirteen bucks.
Homer,What?
Homer,"Bart, did you hear that? What a name -- ""Santa's Little Helper"". It's a sign! It's an omen!"
Homer,"Sorry, Barney. I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on Christmas eve."
Homer,Uh-uh.
Homer,"Well, okay. Let's go."
Homer,Who's Tiny Tim?
Homer,I can't believe I'm doing this.
Homer,"Hey, Barney, which one is Whirlwind?"
Homer,What! That scrawny little bag of bones?
Homer,"Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas."
Homer,What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper?
Homer,Whoa! Ninety-nine times thirteen equals MER-RY CHRISTMAS!
Homer,"Don't you believe in me, son?"
Homer,"Come on, boy. Sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going."
Homer,That's my boy. Everything on Santa's Little Helper.
Homer,"Come on, Bart. Kiss the ticket for good luck, not that we need it. Heh-heh-heh."
Homer,"Come on Santa's Little Helper! Go, go, go! Run your tail off!"
Homer,Go! Go!
Homer,"Come on, boy."
Homer,I don't want to leave till our dog finishes.
Homer,"Ah, forget it. Let's go."
Homer,"Find any winners, son?"
Homer,"Oh, no you don't. No. No. Get away from me. Uh-uh."
Homer,But he's a loser. He's pathetic. He's...
Homer,"All right, look everybody. I have a confession to make."
Homer,"I didn't get my Christmas bonus. I tried not to let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did, I just couldn't --"
Homer,It is?
Homer,"Number eight. I mean, Santa's Little Helper."
Homer,Bart!
Homer,Lisa!
Homer,I'm warning you two!
Homer,RUDOLPH WITH YOUR NOSE... OVER HERE... / SO YOU CAN GUIDE MY SLEIGH TODAY....
Homer,Hmmmm. How could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?
Homer,"Oh, wait! Here's a good one -- ""do""."
Homer,Hey! No abbreviations!
Homer,"Hey, shut up, boy."
Homer,We got one?
Homer,Get outta here.
Homer,"Wait a minute, you little cheater. You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is."
Homer,I'll show you a big dumb balding ape!
Homer,"That's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. Hey, look at this! ""I am a weiner."" He sure is!"
Homer,"What have you done this time, boy?"
Homer,"Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?"
Homer,"Oh, no. He can't mean that."
Homer,My wife thinks you want me to pay for it.
Homer,Oh.
Homer,What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.
Homer,A what?
Homer,This lunkhead?
Homer,Nine hundred and twelve?
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Come on, Bart, your mother's only trying to help. So go ahead and enjoy the show."
Homer,"Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?"
Homer,"How 'bout a tie, son? Everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties."
Homer,"Sorry, boy."
Homer,"Nonsense, Marge! Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today."
Homer,"It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. Lisa, maybe you should try some of this."
Homer,"I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up."
Homer,Gotcha!
Homer,"Don't worry son, you can have mine. Here, let me show you how to put on a tie."
Homer,The hook goes over the top and these things go in there.
Homer,"Well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, I think. Now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations. You may outsmart someone."
Homer,"So, how was it?"
Homer,What?
Homer,"Wow! What are you readin' there? Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?"
Homer,"Tell you what: To celebrate your first day of genius school, whaddaya say we go out for a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?"
Homer,But I'm not a genius. Why should I suffer?
Homer,Jeez. No beer... no opera dogs...
Homer,"Don't stifle the boy, Marge. We're supposed to encourage him."
Homer,Who's the lard butt?
Homer,P.U. When is this over?
Homer,"Is that one fat enough for you, son?"
Homer,Let's go get a burger.
Homer,"Sorry, Bart. Your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some Swedish meatball."
Homer,"Well, I guess we don't have to do that."
Homer,"Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark."
Homer,"Can you still see the ball, Bart?"
Homer,"Oh, you don't think so, eh? Well, here comes some real heat."
Homer,"So what was it you wanted to tell me, son?"
Homer,"Well, I bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. Come on, son."
Homer,"Don't be discouraged, son. I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the light bulb."
Homer,"What is it, son?"
Homer,What?
Homer,"Why, you little -- !"
Homer,You can't stay in there forever!
Homer,March your butt right out here. Now!
Homer,"But -- son, if you don't come out I can't ""hug"" you... and ""kiss you""... and make you feel all better."
Homer,Nothin's easy.
Homer,"You know, I defy anyone to tell the difference between these donuts and ones baked today. Hey, my boy's s'posed to be here any second on a field trip. They been through here yet?"
Homer,You're right! I gotta get where the action is!
Homer,Comin' through.
Homer,"Oh, hi, boy!"
Homer,"But, sir, I --"
Homer,Those perfectionists? Forget it.
Homer,I'm no Supervising Technician. I'm a Technical Supervisor. I've never done anything worthwhile in my life. I'm a big worthless nothing.
Homer,"You're right! I'm young, I'm able-bodied, and I'll take anything. Watch out, Springfield, here I come."
Homer,I'm just a Technical Supervisor who cared too much.
Homer,"You'll get that punk someday, Moe."
Homer,"Moe, I think I'll have another -- -- Whoops. Moe, I'm a little low on funds. You think could cover me just this once?"
Homer,Why not? I think after all these years I deserve an explanation.
Homer,Oh.
Homer,I'm fine. I'm just thinking.
Homer,You think you can still do that kind of work?
Homer,Beer! Now there's a temporary solution.
Homer,"There must be some beer here somewhere... Ah, maybe in here."
Homer,Damn!
Homer,I need money!
Homer,"Oh, no, what have I done? I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? A few measly cents. Not even enough to buy one beer. Wait a minute, lemme count and make sure..."
Homer,Not even close.
Homer,"""Dear Family: I am an utter failure and you'll be better off without me. By the time you read this, I will be in my watery grave. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'Stand tall, have courage and never give up.' I only hope I can provide a better model in death than I did in life. Warmest regards, Love Homer J. Simpson."""
Homer,Almost there.
Homer,"Hey, you idiot! Watch where you're going!"
Homer,"Well, live and learn."
Homer,"Boy, this intersection is dangerous! Someone ought to put a stop sign here."
Homer,"Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign."
Homer,Wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley
Homer,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed Councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. Danger comes in many, many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our cavemen ancestors to the --"
Homer,I think we should put a stop sign at D Street and Twelfth. The other --
Homer,Wow. They listened to me.
Homer,"Hey, if they think I'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken."
Homer,Proud. Proud of what?
Homer,"Ah, what a great family! But come on, we all know this is small potatoes. There is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together."
Homer,I'm talking about that!
Homer,"What did you say, son?"
Homer,That's okay. I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say.
Homer,Thank you.
Homer,"Unlike most of you, I am not a nut. Just a good, honest American who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur."
Homer,"Our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I. Many of them, incompetent boobs. I know this because I have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say, this stinks!"
Homer,Privately?
Homer,"Stay here, I'll be right back."
Homer,Same here.
Homer,"Sorry, no can do!"
Homer,"Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about."
Homer,Hey! What's the problem here?
Homer,"Me in charge of safety? This place could blow sky-high. Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. I can't let Marge support the family. This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I..."
Homer,Umm... What the hey. I'll take the job.
Homer,What?
Homer,"Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --"
Homer,"Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back."
Homer,"I can't do it, Mr. Burns."
Homer,"Hmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. But that's the lug you're looking at. And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have crusading for safety. Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job."
Homer,I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.
Homer,"Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us."
Homer,...and I'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. The only reason I'm telling you this is I'm going to be leaving you.
Homer,"But, don't worry. I've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!"
Homer,Whoa! Easy! Don't drop me! Be careful.
Homer,"You were? Aw, well go ahead."
Homer,"Look, you'd better get this all out of your system right now. I don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic."
Homer,Mmmm! Marshmallow!
Homer,"I'm trying to get at least some of the unfortunate noises out of my system while I can, Marge. I don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic."
Homer,Are you sure that's enough? You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.
Homer,"Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word ""bonehead""."
Homer,"There it is, kids... Stately Burns Manor. Heaven on earth."
Homer,"Okay, now look. My boss is gonna be at this picnic, so I want you to show your father some love and/or respect."
Homer,"Afternoon, Mr. Burns."
Homer,"Simpson, Homer."
Homer,"Don't correct the man, Brat. Oh, Boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts."
Homer,"Why you, listen to me you..."
Homer,"No, heh, heh, heh. Just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man."
Homer,"Now, remember, as far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family."
Homer,Be normal! Be normal!
Homer,Bart!
Homer,Bart! Lisa! Maggie!
Homer,"Where are you, kids?"
Homer,Gotcha!
Homer,Marge! Knock it off!
Homer,Is it used?
Homer,You remember the rules from last year?
Homer,"Bart! No! No! No, no! Oh no, Bart, No! Don't! Noooo!"
Homer,"Marge, I need you."
Homer,"Snap out of it, Marge. You've got to come with me--the boss is going to make a toast!"
Homer,"Well, you picked a perfect time to start."
Homer,Wahhhhhhhhh!
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"Quick, Bart, give me a kiss."
Homer,"Bart, please. Five bucks for a kiss."
Homer,"Boy, I'm glad that's over. Now we can go home and act normal again."
Homer,"Oh come on. That cornball routine. ""I love you, Daddy."" Give me a break."
Homer,Why?
Homer,"Look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. We've got to do better as a family. So tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV. We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family."
Homer,Yes.
Homer,No. We're going to say grace first.
Homer,"No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Now can the chatter and bow your heads. Dear Lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it. I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my French... but they act like savages! Did you see them at the picnic? Oh, of course you did. You're everywhere. You're omnivorous. Oh, Lord, why did you smite me with this family?"
Homer,No! I'm not done yet.
Homer,"I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in town."
Homer,"You think so, huh? Well, there's only one way to find out. Follow me."
Homer,"Look at that, kids! No fighting, no yelling..."
Homer,Yahhhhhhhh!
Homer,"Oh, you think so? Well, let's see what's behind Door Number Two."
Homer,I wish I could hear what they're saying.
Homer,Probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers.
Homer,It's worse than you think. I just trampled these poor saps' flower bed.
Homer,"No, no. I want to be alone with my thought."
Homer,"Another beer, Moe."
Homer,I've got some wieners in my pocket.
Homer,"You know, Moe, my Mom once said something that really stuck with me. She said, ""Homer, you're a big disappointment,"" and, God bless her soul, she was really onto something."
Homer,"You can't talk that way about my kids. Or, at least two of them."
Homer,"Why, you... Here's five you haven't met."
Homer,Huh... what?
Homer,When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. Heh-heh. They're on TV!
Homer,"All right, time for a family meeting!"
Homer,"Now, look, you know and I know this family needs help. Professional help. So I made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe."
Homer,"Boxing, Lisa, boxing. There's a world of difference."
Homer,"Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study. And of all the commercials I saw, his was the best. All it costs is two hundred and fifty dollars."
Homer,"Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. Marge, go get the kids' college fund."
Homer,"Oh, come on, Marge. Why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?"
Homer,That's it? That's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?
Homer,"Well, we're not licked yet. To save this family, we're gonna have to make the supreme sacrifice."
Homer,"Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here."
Homer,Would you pay one hundred fifty dollars for this lovely Motorola?
Homer,Ready as she'll ever be!
Homer,"Hey, no pain, no gain."
Homer,"Cash, of course. I've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here with me. I'm holding it right now. Here it is. Look. Check it out. Two hundred and fifty big ones."
Homer,Bart!
Homer,Lisa!
Homer,"Whoops. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention."
Homer,Good idea.
Homer,Wait a minute. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. What's the point?
Homer,Unortho what?
Homer,Arrrgh!
Homer,Why you...
Homer,"Oh, yes, doctor."
Homer,Arrrgh!
Homer,Arrrgh!
Homer,Arrrgh!
Homer,"Wait a minute, Doc! Your TV commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!"
Homer,Wow! Five hundred smackers!
Homer,That piece of junk? Forget it! We're going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
Homer,Do I smell cupcakes?
Homer,"Oooo, Do I ever!"
Homer,Ah. Say no more.
Homer,No.
Homer,"Bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing."
Homer,"Well, you see, boy. It never hurts to grease the wheels a little."
Homer,"Surely, Lisa. You see how it works, Bart? A cupcake here, a good grade there."
Homer,"Yeah, right, Lis. It's the three roads to success, Bart. Work, brains, and..."
Homer,"Yeah, and I got the day off from work."
Homer,"But what's a day off from work when I'm never gonna see my beloved son again. Oh, Bart. Oh, Bart."
Homer,"Tough day at school, boy?"
Homer,"So you had a little scuffle, eh? Hope you won."
Homer,"Bart, your mother has the fool idea that you're upset about something."
Homer,"Come on, Bart, we don't want your mother to see you crying. Here, let me help you dry those tears."
Homer,"So, what's the problem, son?"
Homer,"Come on, Marge. I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa."
Homer,What? And violate the code of the school yard? I'd rather Bart died.
Homer,"The code of the School yard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see... Don't tattle... Always make fun of those different from you... Never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... Hmmm, what else... ?"
Homer,"Yeah, right! This ought to be good for a laugh."
Homer,"Aw, Marge."
Homer,"Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi. Let's go, boy."
Homer,Now here's that bully of yours. Show me your stuff.
Homer,"No, no! Not like that! Like this!"
Homer,"See, that boy? You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he."
Homer,"Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own."
Homer,"So the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded..."
Homer,And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
Homer,"And if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations."
Homer,"Awright, you kids, keep it down! Am I making myself... ?"
Homer,"You, up in the tree! The tall gray­ haired kid! Get your butt down here right now!"
Homer,"What about you, boy?"
Homer,Cupcakes.
Homer,"Not now, Marge."
Homer,"Lisa! Lisa, are you still in there? What's the problem? Did you fall in? Lisa!"
Homer,Wha' th--
Homer,"Where the hell are my keys? Who stole my keys? Come on, I'm late for work."
Homer,The den! Great idea!
Homer,Do you know where my keys are?
Homer,Rumpus room. Great idea!
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"All right. Hey, hey!"
Homer,"Come on, come on. Let's go."
Homer,Must you do this every time?
Homer,"Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on!"
Homer,Okay. Here we go.
Homer,"Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid!"
Homer,Ohhh... get out of the corner!
Homer,"What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way."
Homer,Lisa?
Homer,"""Lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad."" Well, she doesn't look sad. I don't see any tears in her eyes."
Homer,"Oh, sure I would, princess. I have feelings, too. You know, like ""my stomach hurts"" or ""I'm going crazy"". Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it?"
Homer,Well... eh... er...eh...
Homer,"Come on, Lisa... ride the Homer horsey. Giddiyap! Whee!"
Homer,Thanks for knowing I mean well.
Homer,"You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor!"
Homer,"In times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. Now hop to it, boy!"
Homer,No.
Homer,"Oh, no, come on! Don't let that boy -- get out of the... Oh, no, not again! Don't. Don't. Don't. Great, get over. Oh, geeze."
Homer,I am not. It's just that I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. Lisa! Lisa!
Homer,"Lisa, what did I tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house?"
Homer,"Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy."
Homer,Let's hear it.
Homer,You just clack as loud as you want. Lis.
Homer,What th...
Homer,"Bart, go easy on me. I'm your Dad."
Homer,"No, Bart, no."
Homer,"You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life is when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So why are you still awake?"
Homer,"Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing."
Homer,"Oh, no, Marge!"
Homer,"Marge, are you all right?"
Homer,"Then you've heard. Oh, God. What are we doing to do? The lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!"
Homer,"Oh. Me, too."
Homer,Bart!
Homer,Gimme some quarters. I'm doing my laundry.
Homer,Where's the video boxing?
Homer,"Hey, that kid's pretty good."
Homer,"No, me! No, Me!"
Homer,Listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do?
Homer,"Aw, come on."
Homer,You little... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
Homer,"That's okay. With the tips you've given me, I'm going to pound the tar out of a certain little smarty pants tonight."
Homer,Excuse me. I think I hear my wife calling.
Homer,"Just try not to kill me too hard, son. Heh-heh-heh."
Homer,"Kid, tonight's not your night."
Homer,Oh! Oh! Block it.
Homer,Uh-oh. You missed me.
Homer,Ha ha! I got you. Don't try that. I got ya. I'll block you. And the crowd is on its feet as Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill.
Homer,"Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment."
Homer,"Bart-the-bloody-pulp Simpson is on the ropes. He's hoping I'll put him out of his misery. Well, you're in luck, Bart, here comes my right."
Homer,"Oh, noooo!"
Homer,"My game! My game! I coulda beat the boy! Marge, how could you? I was so close."
Homer,What?
Homer,"Just be happy with what you got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanderses."
Homer,Bart! I suppose it has..uh..various features?
Homer,A satellite dish!
Homer,"But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do."
Homer,Oooh! Credit.
Homer,I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?
Homer,Where is it?
Homer,Does it have a deep fryer?
Homer,Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.
Homer,"Hey, how much is it?"
Homer,"Yeah, how much is it?"
Homer,You do?
Homer,No.
Homer,Is that a good siren? Am I approved?
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob."
Homer,How much do you want for it?
Homer,I swear it Bob.
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,On my honor.
Homer,"Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be alright if I conferred with my family?"
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,No.
Homer,All right. All right! I'll take it.
Homer,Hey Flanders! Look what I got!
Homer,Jealous. Everybody ready?
Homer,"that's the spirit. Ready or not, nature here we come!"
Homer,Bart!
Homer,Lisa!
Homer,I'll tell you when we get there. Go back to your smell game.
Homer,Pfft. Maps.
Homer,Don't worry. This is an all-terrain vehicle.
Homer,"Ah, come on. We're going back to nature."
Homer,What do you think? Should we stop here?
Homer,All righty.
Homer,"Well, here we are!"
Homer,"Okay, nobody move. Nobody panic. When I give the word, everyone ever so slowly open your door and slide out. On the count of three. One..."
Homer,"Well, heh heh, now we get a chance to be real pioneers."
Homer,"Yes sir! This is a real adventure. Why, I bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this."
Homer,Will somebody help her?
Homer,Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
Homer,"Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings."
Homer,What am I going to do? I've murdered us all.
Homer,Shut up!
Homer,There! Finished.
Homer,"Well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter."
Homer,"Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax."
Homer,"That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods."
Homer,"Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone."
Homer,"And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of."
Homer,A rattler!
Homer,"Run, you fool!"
Homer,"Through here, boy. Back to civilization."
Homer,"When you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. It becomes natural. Like a third sense."
Homer,"Bart? Where are you, Bart?"
Homer,His lucky red hat! Oh dear God! No! Bart!
Homer,"Bart! Oh Bart! Bart, Bart! Oh, Bart, my beautiful son. Why couldn't you have taken me? Of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me?"
Homer,What the--? You're alive!... and... buck nekkid.
Homer,What? Oooh! Jungle Man!
Homer,"The first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: Conceal your nakedness."
Homer,"Okay, slap a fern on there, boy. Now, some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little mollusk. And mollusk for me. All right. We're ready to hit the town."
Homer,"Ah food. Good thinking, son."
Homer,This young sapling ought to do the trick.
Homer,"No. This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy."
Homer,Shhhh! Just watch.
Homer,"Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!"
Homer,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him."
Homer,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Aaah!
Homer,"G-g-good night, s-son. S-sleep tight."
Homer,No.
Homer,How would I know. Quit asking pointless... Bart look!
Homer,Honey! Honey! We're saved!
Homer,Tangy.
Homer,Wah-neh! Wah-neh!
Homer,Wah neh! Wah neh!
Homer,Pleehhh! Hnnnn! Plem! Feh!
Homer,Femmmmm! Wah! Gnnn! Hrmmerhrr!
Homer,Plemk heh feh.
Homer,Just a little farther... just a little further... just a little further. Food!
Homer,Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles.
Homer,Praise the grizzles son.
Homer,Maggie! Oh my little girl!
Homer,"Nice grizzly, nice grizzly."
Homer,"Avenge me, son. Avenge my death."
Homer,Can I have some apple sauce?
Homer,"Oh, Marge. The guys at work are going to have a field day with this."
Homer,"Ooh, those stupid eggheads."
Homer,"You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh."
Homer,"They've got us cornered, boy. We'll never get away. Give me the head."
Homer,No!
Homer,"Son, we're in this mess together. No matter how tempting it might be, I can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob."
Homer,"We'll die together, like a father and son should."
Homer,Get him!
Homer,Oh no.
Homer,No!
Homer,No we don't. Try being objective for once in your... oooh!
Homer,"But you don't understand, Marge. I have fifty bucks riding on this game."
Homer,"This isn't gambling, Marge. It's a lead pipe cinch."
Homer,Oh no!
Homer,Where is it. The game... where is it?
Homer,Ah!
Homer,Catch it! catch it!
Homer,All right!
Homer,Lazar who?
Homer,"Oh no, no. We stink, we stink!"
Homer,Maybe.
Homer,"Make it, make it, make it, make it."
Homer,"Oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
Homer,It's good! It's good! It's good!
Homer,It's good to see you all in church.
Homer,What? Oh yeah. You were great.
Homer,What was it about?
Homer,"Oh! He didn't by any chance say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he?"
Homer,What! Those cute little monkeys? That's terrible. Who told you that?
Homer,"I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?"
Homer,Marge. They're only space mutants.
Homer,I hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?
Homer,"Here you go, son. Share the wealth, that's what I always say."
Homer,"Wow! Look at these bowling balls, Maggie. Can you think of a better way for Daddy to spend his hard won fifty bucks?"
Homer,"Now I've seen everything. Black marbleized with a liquid center. The ""Stealth Bowler"" -- the pins don't know what hit 'em."
Homer,"Sure, boy. What's on your mind?"
Homer,"I'm glad you asked, son. Being popular is the most important thing in the world."
Homer,"You're not talking about killing anyone, are you?"
Homer,Are you?
Homer,Then run along you little scamp. A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
Homer,"Oooh. Look at this one. ""The Hammer of Thor. It will send your pins to Valhalla."" Lisa?"
Homer,"Ooooh, that's some ball."
Homer,Just a statue? Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning Tower of Piza just a statue?
Homer,I knew it all along.
Homer,Yeah? Why you little...
Homer,"Lay off the boy, Marge. He's a good kid. Quit givin' him the third degree."
Homer,"Well, maybe I am a little responsible."
Homer,"C'mon, son. Let's take the head thing back to the authorities."
Homer,"You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh."
Homer,"Good going, son. But remember, most lynch mobs aren't this nice."
Homer,Huh? Whuh?
Homer,My birthday?
Homer,It's my birthday? What did I get? I love birthdays.
Homer,"Of course I know! Sure! You really thought I forgot, didn't you?"
Homer,"Huh... a very thoughtful gift. But it's a surprise. You know, it's such a beautiful morning, I think I'll take a little stroll around the block."
Homer,"Oh, no. Come on, come on! Open up!"
Homer,Ah... no.
Homer,Too salty...
Homer,"Ummm, nah..."
Homer,"Hmmm. Nah, too corny..."
Homer,Too exciting.
Homer,Hmmmm!
Homer,Be right there.
Homer,"Ah, sounds delightful. Just you and me and the balladeers."
Homer,Fair enough.
Homer,"What's that, Patty?"
Homer,Bart!
Homer,Hold on! Hold on now! Your mother hasn't opened my present yet.
Homer,"Whoop! Don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. Beauty, isn't she?"
Homer,"Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does."
Homer,"You always say we should talk. I'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. But I'm going to stop in a second. So, please say something back, Marge, please. I'm gonna stop talking... now."
Homer,What? No...
Homer,"I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could I?"
Homer,"Well, if that's how you feel, I'll take it back."
Homer,So you'd know it's from me!
Homer,What? But you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.
Homer,Well... you're welcome.
Homer,"Now this is living, eh, kids? Hot pizza... the food of kings."
Homer,"Lisa, I'm not scared. I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. Does the time always drag like this?"
Homer,"Okay. We've eaten, and eaten well. Now, what else do we have to do? Well, let's check the list your mom left us."
Homer,"Eat, mm-hm."
Homer,"Ooh. Clean up. Now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in."
Homer,"All right, we're clean. Now we'll... put Maggie to bed."
Homer,"Ahhh... ahhh... Oh, how was bowling?"
Homer,"Sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing."
Homer,Oh? You're going back?
Homer,"Uh, no, I don't mind."
Homer,'Night.
Homer,Marge?
Homer,Nothing.
Homer,For Marge?
Homer,"Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball."
Homer,"Oh, sorry... ouch!"
Homer,I gave you advice? Get outta here.
Homer,Hmm. Good advice.
Homer,"Marge, may I speak to you?"
Homer,"You know, I've been thinking... Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. But your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. I don't know how you do it. You've just got a gift, I guess. I've always thought so. I just never mentioned it. But it's time you knew how I feel. I don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. ...Goodbye, my wife."
Homer,Starving.
Homer,How can I eat it? She made it. It's all I have left.
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?"
Homer,Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.
Homer,"Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was this thick. And Eugene Fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. And he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance."
Homer,"Pffft. I have to warn you, Marge -- I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly."
Homer,"Just keepin' you on your toes, babe."
Homer,"Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds?! I'm a blimp! Why are all the good things so tasty? From now on, exercise every morning."
Homer,"Oh no! Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds. I'm a whale. Why was I was cursed with this weakness for snack treats? Well, from now on, exercise every morning, Homer."
Homer,"Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance."
Homer,"No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing."
Homer,"No, my supervisor."
Homer,"Hey, what is this? The Spanish Exposition?"
Homer,Bart! What are you doing?
Homer,Where am I... the Planet Cornball?
Homer,Oooh... entertainment.
Homer,"Hey, shut up!"
Homer,"Ooh, look at him squirm."
Homer,"I'm sorry, I don't usually laugh like this."
Homer,"Oh, this is the most fun I've had in my whole life."
Homer,"One glazed and one scratch-and-win, please."
Homer,"Sorry, buddy. You got me confused with Fred Flintstone."
Homer,"Oooh, Liberty bell! Another liberty bell! One more and I'm a millionaire. Come on, Liberty bell! Please, please, please please, please please. That purple fruit thing! Where were you yesterday?"
Homer,"What are you on, pal?"
Homer,"Well, a doo dee doo doo to you, too, pint size!"
Homer,"Man, you get a lot of nutcases in here."
Homer,"I hear ya, buddy! Whew! Full moon!"
Homer,Hmmm... still got it!
Homer,"I-it's meaningless, Marge. Don't even attempt to find meaning in it. There's nothing between me and Princess Kashmir."
Homer,Your photo?
Homer,Why you little --
Homer,Look Marge... honey... baby doll... I...
Homer,"What are you saying, Honey?"
Homer,But where will I sleep?
Homer,Would a motel be okay?
Homer,"Aw, I knew you'd come to your..."
Homer,"Oh, Moe. My wife gave me the old heave-ho because of some lousy picture."
Homer,"Motel, I guess."
Homer,"Look, Barney. See the row of tiny lights up there? The middle one is my house. Someone must have left the porch light on."
Homer,Barney!
Homer,"Don't listen to him, Marge, he's..."
Homer,"No, Barn. I just want to crawl into bed."
Homer,Oh no.
Homer,"What do you mean, sir?"
Homer,"It won't happen again, sir. I promise. May I get out of your sight now?"
Homer,"Uh... Mr. Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover-boy."
Homer,"I don't really know, sir."
Homer,"Well... Uh... Wine 'em, dine 'em, bring 'em flowers, write 'em love poetry, sir."
Homer,Anybody home?
Homer,How's your Mom?
Homer,"Oh, thanks, boy."
Homer,"Hello, Marge. It's me. Homer."
Homer,Are you still mad?... You are still mad. No need to say it. I'm your loving husband. I can read you like a book. I'll just have some milk.
Homer,"Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton. Come on, Marge. Please forgive me? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
Homer,Yes I do. Because I'm hungry... my clothes are smelly... and I'm tired.
Homer,"Oh, he does not!"
Homer,"So what should I do, Marge?"
Homer,"Okay. Your wish is my command, my little..."
Homer,"You see, I'm trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects."
Homer,Forget that. I'm teaching my boy a lesson. Is she here or not?
Homer,Marge. Marge. We're gonna try one more place. The Sapphire Lounge. Bart! I said look at the floor!
Homer,"There she is! Hey, Princess! It's me, the guy from the snap shot!"
Homer,Oooo.
Homer,"Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object."
Homer,"I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. I want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings, too."
Homer,Could you tell him a little about yourself?
Homer,Thank you very much ma'am. We'll be out of your...
Homer,Oh no.
Homer,Ahhhhhh!
Homer,ABOUT A MILLION GIRLS.
Homer,Hep... heyyy... whoooo... look out... yeah... Da da da da da.
Homer,Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop the music... Quiet please... I have something to say. Quiet!
Homer,"Quiet! I have something to say to all the sons out there; to all the boys; to all the men; to all of us. It's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. No, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews -- well, not our nephews -- they are our mothers. And you know something, folks? As ridiculous as it sounds, I would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as I sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string. Am I wrong, or am I right?"
Homer,Marge!
Homer,"Jeez, Louise. Look at this mess."
Homer,I told that boy a billion times to pick up his jun--
Homer,My back! There goes my back again!
Homer,"Go get help, boy."
Homer,"Oh, Maggie. My poor back."
Homer,The boy. Bring me the boy.
Homer,Oh Marge! I still hurt! Marge! Marge!
Homer,"Actually, I was wondering if you could make me a grilled cheese sandwich?"
Homer,Make sure it's squished flat and crunchy on the outside.
Homer,"And maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can. Oh, and some fruit cocktail... in heavy syrup."
Homer,Marge! Marge! Marge! Get the door.
Homer,"Oh, hello Principal Skinner. I'd get up but the boy crippled me."
Homer,That old gag.
Homer,"Hear him out, Marge."
Homer,"Sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months."
Homer,"Yeah, but what about Bart?"
Homer,"Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam you are?"
Homer,You mean all white with pink eyes?
Homer,He makes me crazy twelve months a year. At least you get the summer off.
Homer,"Bon voyage, boy."
Homer,"I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room."
Homer,"Goodbye, Bart."
Homer,Be good.
Homer,You gotta be kiddin'. The lek?
Homer,Give me the old stars and stripes.
Homer,Political what?
Homer,"Affectionate little Albanian, isn't he?"
Homer,"Please, please kids. Stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being a land of opportunity, and maybe Adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers."
Homer,"Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing."
Homer,"Oh, she's just jealous. She'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her."
Homer,Just kidding.
Homer,"Nice and cozy, Adil?"
Homer,"Look, Adil. You can call me Dad."
Homer,Aww. You called me dad.
Homer,You want to see where I work?
Homer,None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.
Homer,"Well, I'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in Security, but sure, you bet."
Homer,"See these? American donuts. Glazed, powdered, and raspberry filled. Now how's that for freedom of choice?"
Homer,Uh... maybe. Hold on a second.
Homer,"Hey, Lenny. Does this place have one of those plutonium isolation deals?"
Homer,Sector Twelve?
Homer,"Oh, that Sector Twelve."
Homer,"Come along, Adil."
Homer,You little shutterbug.
Homer,Cheese!
Homer,"Well, he sure makes life a lot easier around here. You have to admit that."
Homer,"Okay, okay. I love Bart. Well..."
Homer,Well?
Homer,Darn tootin'.
Homer,"Honey, I'm home."
Homer,"Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted. I'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. I bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to."
Homer,"Ooh, trouble in the neighborhood. Let's check it out."
Homer,"I'm his neighbor, what'd he do?"
Homer,Oooo.
Homer,Wow!
Homer,Aw!
Homer,Hmmm.
Homer,Gee whiz. Adil would get a kick out of seeing this.
Homer,Adil! Oh... there you are.
Homer,"Ouch! Watch it! Hey. Ow, Ouch!"
Homer,"So, he's going to prison?"
Homer,"Goodbye, Adil. I'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted."
Homer,"He needs me. Hey, boy."
Homer,"Sorry, Marge. Some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle."
Homer,"Did you hear that, Marge? My boy speaks French."
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,"Oooh, premium -- wait a minute. Why?"
Homer,"How you doin', Apu?"
Homer,"Mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... New flavor! Triple chocolate!"
Homer,Perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.
Homer,"The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""
Homer,"Sorry, pal..."
Homer,And he had a big nose.
Homer,"No, bigger. And big red hair that came out to... yeah, yeah like that."
Homer,Yeah. Wait a minute. It's the guy from TV. My kid's hero... Cruddy... Crummy... Krusty the Clown!
Homer,"Well, uh... m-maybe you better run off to bed..."
Homer,"Yes, sir."
Homer,"Well, if the crime is making me laugh, they're all guilty."
Homer,"Oh, definitely number... Heh heh..."
Homer,Four.
Homer,I'm home everybody.
Homer,"Oh fantastic. Marge, you're never gonna believe what happened. I was down at the Kwik-E-Mart minding my own business when... Oooh oooh, ooh, the news."
Homer,Wait a minute. Bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?
Homer,"He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?"
Homer,"The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""
Homer,Earth to Marge. Earth to Marge. I was there... the clown's G-I-L-L -T-Y.
Homer,"Sorry, son. You'll understand one day."
Homer,"Yes, sir."
Homer,"Yes, I do."
Homer,Okay.
Homer,"No, I'm not. I'm hopping on the bandwagon. Now come on, son, get with the winning team."
Homer,"Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court. I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated."
Homer,Oooh.
Homer,Ahhhh!
Homer,"Hey, turn it up. I love hearing those whack-os."
Homer,Don't be ridiculous. My wife worships the ground I walk on.
Homer,"I hope you do find that punk someday, Moe. Fill 'er up."
Homer,"Let's just say, I don't feel like goin' home tonight. Jar, please."
Homer,You might say that. My wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks I'm a pig.
Homer,What?
Homer,"What? Hey, Barney, am I a pig?"
Homer,"Oh, no."
Homer,"Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that."
Homer,I read you loud and clear.
Homer,Uh... I'd like some flowers.
Homer,"Uh, you know, pretty ones. Like that."
Homer,"One, please."
Homer,"Marge, I uh... love you. Marge, honey, I love you. Ohhh... Marge, I love you, baby. Hmm, Marge, sweetie, hooney, honey... Aah, this'll never work."
Homer,"I love you, Marjorie."
Homer,...and I've made reservations at the Chez Paree.
Homer,"It matters not, mon frere. And after desserts, we'll adjourn to our second-floor room at the Off Ramp Inn."
Homer,Oops.
Homer,"Hello, this is Mr... Sampson."
Homer,"No. I said Sampson, not Simpson."
Homer,"Actually, the Simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a quite misunderstood and underrated family."
Homer,"BA, BA / BA, BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA, BA, BA, BA / BA, BA BA!"
Homer,"BA, BA / BA BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA..."
Homer,"You know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man."
Homer,"Son, there's not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo."
Homer,"Out, boy, out."
Homer,Smooth as a baby's behind.
Homer,"I think you're right, dumplin'."
Homer,"BART, GET THE DOOR!"
Homer,"Well, don't just stand there, boy. Help Miss Botz with her suitcases."
Homer,Bye kids. Watch out for the boy.
Homer,They all look so tasty. But I think I'll eat this one right there.
Homer,Why?
Homer,"Oh, okay. Then I'll take that one there with the beady eyes."
Homer,"Oui, oui. After you. And I'll be seeing you later."
Homer,Because I'm so carefree?
Homer,More champagne?
Homer,Ooops. Time for a fill-up. Garçon! Another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne.
Homer,"You know, Marge, this is just like when we were dating."
Homer,Don't forget to tell me when you see the off-ramp.
Homer,No problemo. We'll just get off at the next exit.
Homer,"Come on, Marge. Let me carry you over the threshold."
Homer,"Sheesh, eleven years ago, and you've never forgotten it."
Homer,"Ooh, your blue thing with the things?"
Homer,"Well, shake a leg, Mama."
Homer,Whoa!
Homer,Mmmm.
Homer,So?
Homer,All right. I suppose my work here is done.
Homer,I don't like the looks of this.
Homer,Ms. Botz? Ms. Botz?
Homer,Good Lord! What have those little hellions done now?
Homer,"We're so sorry, we're so sorry."
Homer,"Oh, these things are heavy."
Homer,"Just so there's no hard feelings, here's double your pay. No, no, triple."
Homer,Sure.
Homer,"Ain't that the truth. You know, one time he --"
Homer,"Just a minute, young man. I don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but I just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off so that --"
Homer,The what?
Homer,"Uh... uh... no. Are you sure this microphone works? Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her. This is on, right? Because, actually, it was quite a struggle."
Homer,"Have you ever seen a Kung Fu movie? It was just like that. But now I know her moves. So, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on Homer Simpson again."
Homer,"Lord help me, I'm just not that bright."
Homer,Yeah. Yeah!
Homer,"Honey, can we make up again?"
Homer,"Eww, I hate that icky soup skin."
Homer,"Mmmm. Marge, Could you get me another beer, please?"
Homer,Sure I do. I just want to have a beer while I'm caring. Marge...
Homer,"What! You did! Well, that's just... oh, what a glorious day! Lisa, hand me your paper."
Homer,"I'm just gonna take this over to the refrigerator and, hmmm. Well as long as I'm here, I might as well kill two birds with one stone."
Homer,Look at those funny little whiskers. Oooo! That reminds me. It's Big Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie. C'mon boy.
Homer,"Oooh, ""Gorilla, The Conqueror."" The granddaddy of them all."
Homer,It's so unfair... just because he's different.
Homer,"Burning the candle at both ends, eh boy? Go get 'em."
Homer,Psst... Marge. Come take a look at this.
Homer,"Just a little dim, I guess."
Homer,What?
Homer,I wish I had Amoria Phlebitis.
Homer,I have hair!... I have hair!
Homer,"Hey, Dr. J."
Homer,Hmmm...
Homer,Hmmm huh.
Homer,Hmmmm
Homer,"And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids."
Homer,I have hair! Look! Look!
Homer,Whoo hoo! All right!
Homer,Yeah!
Homer,"Got ya, Burnsie."
Homer,"Dear God, give a bald guy a break. Amen."
Homer,We're proud of you boy.
Homer,Hitler.
Homer,"Hey, I'm still beating you, boy."
Homer,"Okay. The colors of the Italian flag are red, white and what?"
Homer,I was right.
Homer,Miracle breakthrough! There's been a miracle breakthrough?
Homer,Hair... hair... Just like everybody else.
Homer,"Marge, weren't you listening? This is a miracle breakthrough. Not one of these cheapo sucker deals."
Homer,Great! Great! Great! How much? How much? How much?
Homer,A thousand bucks. I can't afford that.
Homer,"A thousand bucks. Of all the rip-off -- screw job -- gyp joint... forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!"
Homer,"So I say ""Forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!"", and I storm right outta there."
Homer,Out of tartar sauce.
Homer,"They call this a portion? Hey Lenny, are you gonna use all your tartar sauce? Dry fish sticks. This sucks."
Homer,"If I had hair, you wouldn't be calling me that."
Homer,But it's a thousand bucks... Burns would can my butt in no time flat.
Homer,"Nothing... well, that newsletter."
Homer,You got me!
Homer,"Uh, I'd like to charge that Dimoxinil stuff to my health insurance?"
Homer,"Good morning, Springfield! Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Winfield!"
Homer,"Good morning, Moe's Tavern!"
Homer,"Good morning, everybody!"
Homer,Gimme the usual.
Homer,"Daddy's home, Sugar!"
Homer,"Ah, dinner with three beautiful women. I must be in heaven."
Homer,"Well, your resume seems in order. Besides typing and stuff, do you have any other qualifications I should know about?"
Homer,"No, no, that'll be fine, thank you, goodbye."
Homer,Hello?
Homer,"Oh Marge, every woman I i­n­t­e­rview for the secretary job makes kissy faces at me."
Homer,"I'll call you back, Marge."
Homer,"Yes, Mr. Smithers."
Homer,He thinks he's so big.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Who told you?
Homer,I... I de...
Homer,I de...
Homer,I deserve this.
Homer,I deserve this!
Homer,I AM NATURE'S GREATEST MIRACLE!
Homer,"YOU GOT IT, BUDDY!"
Homer,Ooh. Beauty.
Homer,Do any of these suits do that?
Homer,"Ooh, I like this."
Homer,"Gotta run, Marge. Can't be late."
Homer,What? Our anniversary? Are you sure?
Homer,Hello?
Homer,"I love you, Karl -- Marge."
Homer,"Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks."
Homer,"Well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them."
Homer,"Well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and I always run out."
Homer,"Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody."
Homer,The key!
Homer,"Sure thing, Mr. Burns."
Homer,"Can do, sir."
Homer,"Rainy day. There's never gonna be a be a rainy day, Marge. There's not a cloud in the Simpson sky. And what does my little girl want?"
Homer,Yea... eh... how about a pony?
Homer,"Uh, well okay, what the hey?"
Homer,"Karl, you gotta help me. Mr. Burns wants me to make some speech to his executives and -- what do you want?"
Homer,What?
Homer,You did?
Homer,"Karl, you saved me. Why?"
Homer,"Well, thanks, Karl. I don't know what to say."
Homer,"Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you."
Homer,No.
Homer,"Bart, what are you doing?"
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,Ahhhh!
Homer,Boy must die.
Homer,"Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. You ruined your father. You've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary."
Homer,"I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don't you, Marge? You do... you do. You've been squirreling it away, haven't you? Saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? Right? Right?"
Homer,Karl! So that wasn't just a sweet voice I heard inside my head. What are you doing here?
Homer,"Yeah, well, thanks for the speech, Karl, but I can't give it. Look at me!"
Homer,What do you mean?
Homer,"No, I can't. I'm just a big fool."
Homer,How do you know?
Homer,Karl.
Homer,A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.
Homer,"Yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. Bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- I can save this company millions of dollars a year. How? Through Jiko Kanri, the Japanese art of self-management. You see, in the West... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of..."
Homer,Five thousand two... I mean... Lots of money.
Homer,"Uh, why?"
Homer,I don't know... a hundred and two?
Homer,"What! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you."
Homer,"Oh, better hurry up."
Homer,I've never been more awake in my life.
Homer,"Are you kidding? I'm stuck in that dead-end job again. The kids are gonna hate me cause I can't buy them all that stuff I promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause I'm ugly and bald."
Homer,And... and?! What about loving me?
Homer,What?!
Homer,I'M EVERYTHING YOU NEED /
Homer,HOMER MARGE
Homer,"to me."""
Homer,Oooo! What a haul this year. I love Halloween.
Homer,Wait a minute. Let's see what the kids are up to.
Homer,"There you are, my man. And a dollar for yourself."
Homer,Huh? Well... it's all ours!
Homer,"Motivated seller, Marge."
Homer,So we got a good deal for once. Quit fighting it.
Homer,Probably just the house settling.
Homer,I don't know.
Homer,"Ooh, a vortex."
Homer,Catch.
Homer,Hey! Pretty slick!
Homer,"Okay boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one."
Homer,"Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your mother."
Homer,"Now wait a minute, Marge. It's only natural there would be some things wrong with an old house like this. It's a fixer-upper. What's the problem? we get a bunch of priests in here..."
Homer,Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars! We're talking about a few thousand dollars!
Homer,It's got great high ceilings.
Homer,Tell you what -- let's sleep on it. Okay?
Homer,What could happen?
Homer,They are all against me! They all must die!
Homer,"Marge! Oh, Marge!"
Homer,"Aw, come on, Marge. You said you'd sleep on it."
Homer,An ancient Indian what...?
Homer,"Mr. Ploot? Homer Simpson here. When you sold me this house you forgot to mention one little thing. You didn't tell me it was built on an Indian burial ground. No you didn't! Well, that's not my recollection... Yeah! Well... all right, goodbye. He says he mentioned it five or six times."
Homer,"Aw, gee, Marge."
Homer,Not to worry. I'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper.
Homer,Better than your eyes bursting. Ewww!
Homer,Wow!
Homer,"Oooo! That was a big mama. Heh, heh, heh."
Homer,"That should just about do it. Man alive, there's nothing better than a hamburger grilled to perfection..."
Homer,"The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly."
Homer,Hey! Get a load of that spread.
Homer,Smothered pork chops.
Homer,The girl's right. Let's get some applesauce out here for these pork chops.
Homer,"What are you lookin' at, buddy?"
Homer,"Oooh, thanks."
Homer,Marge and I played that old game before we were married.
Homer,"Oooh, a feast."
Homer,Tell us more about this feast.
Homer,"Marge, she's right."
Homer,"Listen, you big stupid space creature. Nobody, but nobody eats the Simpsons."
Homer,Don't play dumb with me. We found your book.
Homer,"Yeah, thanks Lisa."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"'Tis some visitor,"
Homer,"Oh, Lenore."
Homer,Aag!
Homer,'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- This it is and nothing more.
Homer,Sir --
Homer,"-- or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you."
Homer,Surely --
Homer,"-- surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --"
Homer,"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --"
Homer,"-- art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- Tell me... tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
Homer,Ouch! Censer..
Homer,Wretch --
Homer,"-- thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. Respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"
Homer,"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"
Homer,"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Oh, leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
Homer,"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
Homer,Why you little --!
Homer,"Come back here now, Raven"
Homer,"Oh no, Marge. Come on, please."
Homer,"Oh... oh, I hate Halloween."
Homer,"Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time."
Homer,Like getting Washington's birthday and Lincoln's birthday back as separate paid holidays. President's Day! Pfft. What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out --
Homer,So... Someone will punch in for me.
Homer,I'll mutant you.
Homer,"Oh, man. Plain cake donuts? Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. Why can't I ever get here on time?"
Homer,"Uh, uh, just resting my eyes."
Homer,Ah! Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. Holy moly! Nine-thirty.
Homer,"Hello, Marge. Sorry I didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... Yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me."
Homer,"Echo, echo..."
Homer,"Huh? What th... Uh, Mr. Burns?"
Homer,"Sorry, sir. It's just me, Homer Simpson. Is everything all right?"
Homer,"Uh... uh yes, sir."
Homer,"Ooooh, cushy."
Homer,"Well, nobody's perfect."
Homer,"You know, I was just telling the wife that if I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently."
Homer,"I bet you could afford it, though."
Homer,"Uh... don't get me wrong. I mean you're an honest man. I just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'Course I'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. I mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't."
Homer,"Where are we going, sir?"
Homer,"If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?"
Homer,"Well, he's got my vote."
Homer,Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Monty Burns.
Homer,"Oh, Marge. What's the big deal? I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had."
Homer,"I hope Burns and I can count on your support, honey."
Homer,"Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a Burns Booster. Ow!"
Homer,"Not yet, son. Not yet."
Homer,"Ah... great toast, Marge. Hmmm. Oh, by the way, the night before the election Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner."
Homer,"And some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them."
Homer,"Come on, Marge."
Homer,"Kids, please leave the room. I don't want you to see this."
Homer,"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
Homer,"Marge! Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, I'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow."
Homer,"Marge, get back in bed."
Homer,What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.
Homer,What's that got to do with it?
Homer,"But you do get to express yourself. In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve."
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Hey! Hello, handsome!"
Homer,"Bad dog! Bad neighbor dog! Here, let me help you up, Mr. Burns."
Homer,"Are you all right, Mr. Burns?"
Homer,"Bart, would you like to say grace?"
Homer,"""You know, Mr. Burns, my family and I feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?"""
Homer,I was only reading what the card...
Homer,"Uh, Mr. Burns... Uh, Mr. Burns..."
Homer,"Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled! Oh no. I don't like the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, make it better. Please. Can't you make it better, huh?"
Homer,"Hey, you did it!"
Homer,"Aw, Barney."
Homer,"Look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. It's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. And I never want that to happen to me."
Homer,"Well, okay. It all started on ""Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night,"" down at Springfield stadium."
Homer,"You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day."
Homer,"Sure, we get a nice mix here."
Homer,"Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here."
Homer,What are you getting at?
Homer,"Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself."
Homer,"Uh... Simp-sons, sir."
Homer,"Oh, that's okay. The baby's name isn't important. Let's go, Marge."
Homer,"What's the matter, boy?"
Homer,"Wow! Flash Bailor came on to my wife! You've still got the magic, Marge."
Homer,Whoa!
Homer,Hey everybody! How you doin'? Look at me! I'm Homer Simpson! Heh...heh.
Homer,Examine my zipper? Why? Whoops!
Homer,"Thanks, everybody."
Homer,"Hey, Burns! Hey, ""Rag Arm""!"
Homer,"Let's go now... Sa-winggg, batter!"
Homer,"Oh, no. Marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! Of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks..."
Homer,Rub it in.
Homer,"Delicious frosty beer. Fat lot of good that does me, sitting next to old man Burns."
Homer,"Me, sir? Oh, no. Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer."
Homer,"Ohhh. Well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm all turned around on the subject. Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?"
Homer,"Good one, sir."
Homer,LITTLE BABY BATTER / CAN'T CONTROL HIS BLADDER!
Homer,"Will you shut up, I'm trying to think of a name."
Homer,Don't mind if I do.
Homer,"All right, Burnsie."
Homer,C'mon! All we need is a grand slam.
Homer,"What's wrong with you people? Let's show some spirit! Come on, get up!"
Homer,Your team needs you! C'mon!!!
Homer,"As I got up in front of them, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle."
Homer,"I thank you. You're too kind. Glad you enjoyed it, but I can't take all the credit. The batter did his part, too."
Homer,M-- me? A mascot for a bush league team?
Homer,"I should have slept on it. Or at least stared blankly for a while. Perhaps if I'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared."
Homer,"Well, I'm ready to punch in."
Homer,"Nope, this was my own bright idea. C'mon, we gotta hurry. Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos."
Homer,"For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me."
Homer,"Oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. Woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie."
Homer,Oh yeah? And where might that be? Oh.
Homer,"Helen, I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight. How 'bout giving me ""Baby Elephant Walk"" with a little reggae kinda beat?"
Homer,"You wanted to see me, ""Tex""?"
Homer,"Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick."
Homer,Me? In the majors?
Homer,"Wait a minute, Capital City has a mascot. The greatest mascot there is: The Capital City ""Goofball""."
Homer,I'll say!
Homer,Because they might say no.
Homer,This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced. I should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.
Homer,I shouldn't have called her that. Bite my tongue. Bite my tongue. Oooh.
Homer,It won't be so bad. You'll die someplace else.
Homer,Phfft. You'll make new and better friends.
Homer,You mean -- ?
Homer,It's not that simple. I've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.
Homer,"That's right, Ned."
Homer,"Oh, knock it off, Flanders! Don't start blubbering on me. I'm gonna miss you too... not."
Homer,"... Some may say that I have been given a bad break in life -- little education, bald as a cue ball, ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today, as I leave for Capital City, I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the Earth!"
Homer,"With the fickle fans already forgetting me, I was ready to take the biggest step of my life."
Homer,"Well kids, there it is, Capital City."
Homer,Wow!
Homer,"Kids, look! Street crime!"
Homer,Wow! That's service!
Homer,The Duff Brewery!
Homer,"Sorry, honey. I'm just a little nervous."
Homer,"We would talk about it always. For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did."
Homer,"Okay, here are your tickets. They're supposed to be good. You're sitting with the player's wives. And don't forget to cheer for me."
Homer,Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.
Homer,Wow.
Homer,"Omigod! I don't believe it. It's really you, the Capital City ""Goofball."""
Homer,"Wow, the fifth."
Homer,"Right, Mr. Goofball."
Homer,"Well, I get up, I dance, I spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of Baby Elephant Walk."
Homer,Who'd've thought it? A free ticket to a big league park but I was too tense to enjoy the game. Every ounce of concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.
Homer,"Oooh, red hots."
Homer,"Mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. Uh oh."
Homer,"I was graceful. I was witty. Brother, I was somethin'."
Homer,But they didn't care.
Homer,It was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.
Homer,The only applause I got was for dragging my carcass out of there.
Homer,What a family.
Homer,My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home I realized how little that helped.
Homer,"So that's it. The costume's buried now. As my son would say, I'm one sad ape-like dude."
Homer,"Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I've become the center of attention."
Homer,Okay. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
Homer,Bust my hump all week... stupid grass... supposed to be the boy's job.
Homer,"H'lo, Flanders."
Homer,Who told? Marge! Beer me!
Homer,Crabgrass? What are you talking about? Where?
Homer,"There's nothing wrong with crabgrass! It just has a bad name, that's all. Everyone would love it if it had a cute name like... uh... elfgrass."
Homer,Marge! Where's the Duff?
Homer,"Don't toy with me, woman."
Homer,"Well, uh, okay. What the heck, I've earned a little break."
Homer,Holy moly! It's... it's... beautiful!
Homer,"Well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, one, two, three, four... eight years."
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, Flanders?"
Homer,"Well, beggars can't be choosy."
Homer,"All right, knock it off!"
Homer,You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here. Your family is better than my family. Your beer comes from farther away than my beer. You and your son like each other. Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. You make me sick!
Homer,I wouldn't stay on a bet!
Homer,One for the road.
Homer,"Sorry, Marge. But it's just that I'm still steamed up about that jerk Flanders. Lousy... bragging... know-it-all... show-off..."
Homer,"Get this. He said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!"
Homer,Well... he...
Homer,No.
Homer,"Okay, okay. It wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!"
Homer,"Oh, he's perfect now, is he?"
Homer,"No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You were right the first time. He's perfect. Perfect in every way."
Homer,I'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. I got a little excited. I'm not perfect... like Ned Flanders.
Homer,Flanders!
Homer,Dear neighbor... 
Homer,You are my brother. I love you and yet I feel a great sadness in my bosom.
Homer,Wait! Wait! There's more...
Homer,"""Neighbors forever. Oh, no! Ned Flanders."""
Homer,"Okay, okay, all right, all right. She's right! Let's do something together. What does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?"
Homer,"Too bad we don't live on a farm. Let's go, boy."
Homer,Fore!
Homer,But I got it in the middle!
Homer,"That was just a practice shot, boy."
Homer,"I know, I know. I can still make this for five. Come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. Pleeze."
Homer,Flanders! What are you doing here?
Homer,That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it.
Homer,Luck.
Homer,Never mind!
Homer,"Yeah, he's entering and what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?"
Homer,Oh yeah! Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week.
Homer,"Come on, boy."
Homer,"Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this. It is not okay to lose."
Homer,"Stay, stay. Good dog. Now, keep your head down."
Homer,"No, not you. I'm talking to the boy. Keep your head down. Follow through..."
Homer,"Okay, that didn't work. This time move your head and don't follow through."
Homer,"What're you doing? That putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player, what a violin is to the guy tha...the violin guy. Now, c'mon, give your putter a name."
Homer,"Come on, give it a name."
Homer,"Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on, give it a girl's name."
Homer,Your putter's name is Charlene!
Homer,It just is. That's why.
Homer,"Now, this is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders. Every day I want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him."
Homer,I'll show you who Charlene is! Now start hating!
Homer,And?
Homer,"But, Marge, this is our big chance to show up the Flanderses."
Homer,Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. And I'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.
Homer,I said NOW!
Homer,Bart! What're you doing? Get down from there before the neighbors see --
Homer,"Flanders, I don't care what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt."
Homer,"Ah, ""may the best man win"". The mating call of the loser."
Homer,"Oh, yeah? Wanna bet?"
Homer,That's right!
Homer,"What, are you afraid to make a real bet?"
Homer,"How about this Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn."
Homer,"Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress."
Homer,"Read that back to me, Marge."
Homer,Oh man. Fine.
Homer,"I'm game if you are, Flanders."
Homer,"Keep your left arm straight, Bart... rotate your shoulders..."
Homer,"Look, son, all I'm asking is that you try."
Homer,Anybody can try! I want you to win!
Homer,"Marge, give me your honest opinion. This? Or this?"
Homer,"Good morning, son! Oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!"
Homer,"See you downstairs, boy."
Homer,Heh heh... that crazy Marmaduke...
Homer,Oatmeal?
Homer,"News flash, Lisa! Bart is not a horse. Eat your steak, boy."
Homer,"Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying. I already did the same thing, and we can't both win."
Homer,"Oh... Well, Flan-ders, it doesn't matter. This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels."
Homer,'Fraid not.
Homer,'Fraid not.
Homer,'Fraid not infinity.
Homer,Woo-hoo-hoo!
Homer,"Come on, Bart. Remember what Vince Lombardi said: ""If you lose, you're out of the family."""
Homer,Ow.
Homer,"Ohhh, so you're gonna welch on our bet?!"
Homer,I got it right here in writing.
Homer,The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.
Homer,It's a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself.
Homer,Listen to 'em laughing... This is so humiliating... I'm never gonna live this down... Damn Flanders...
Homer,"Halftime, Marge, halftime."
Homer,Oh my God! He's enjoying it!
Homer,Bart! Stop fighting with your sister!
Homer,"Stop it, you two! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!"
Homer,Heh... heh... heh. Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.
Homer,Bullwinkle.
Homer,Underdog! Don't you know anything?
Homer,"Son, this is a tradition. If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce."
Homer,"I know, I will."
Homer,"See, Maggie? Those silver and blue guys are the Dallas Cowboys. They're Daddy's favorite team, and he wants them to lose by less than five and a half points. Understand?"
Homer,"Hi, Patty. Hi, Selma."
Homer,"Good to see ya. Well, gotta pick up my old man! 'Bye!"
Homer,"Oh, I love those kids! They've got such a great attitude!"
Homer,"Come on, Dad. Let's get outta here."
Homer,This place is depressing.
Homer,"Oh, well, I'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it. Let's go."
Homer,This thing's gonna be roaring any time now!
Homer,The hell with this.
Homer,Holy moly! That's the biggest... one of those I ever saw.
Homer,"Speaking of heroes, here's mine... Tom Turkey!"
Homer,"All right, Bart that's it! Go to your room NOW!"
Homer,"...And, Lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. You saw what happened. Oh, Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?"
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge'll fix everything."
Homer,"Hey, what are you doing?! No! Drop that drumstick! Bad dog! Bad Santa's Little Helper. Come on... gimme that. Gimme that."
Homer,"Okay, out you go!"
Homer,"Yes, Dad."
Homer,"You know, his girlfriend is the weather lady."
Homer,What show is this?
Homer,"Hello, operator? Gimme the number for 911!"
Homer,Will you forget the report! He's down at the rescue mission!
Homer,"Well uh, we did kinda yell at him... and sent him to his room... and tried to force him to apologize to his sister."
Homer,"We can, and will!"
Homer,"Marge, are we ever gonna see him again?"
Homer,"Oh it's great to have you back, boy! We were afraid we'd lost you!"
Homer,"Yeah, boy. Get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness."
Homer,It's your fault I'm bald!
Homer,"Damn, no spots."
Homer,"You know Marge, we're great parents!"
Homer,"Oh Lord, on this blessed day, we thank thee for giving our family one more crack at togetherness. Amen."
Homer,"Rasputin's got the reach, but on the other hand, the Professor's got his patented coma lock. If you ask me, this is gonna be one hell of a match."
Homer,"Hey, I don't see your name engraved on the bar stool."
Homer,Whoa.
Homer,TRUCKASAUROUS!
Homer,"I have an announcement to make. As a family growth thing, Bart and I think we should all go to the Monster Truck Rally this Saturday."
Homer,"Uh... Monster Truck Rally, growth thing... No, I don't think so."
Homer,"Oh, cruel fate. Why do you mock me?"
Homer,"Eight o'clock, but what does it matter?"
Homer,"Marge, you're a genius."
Homer,Series?!
Homer,"Oh, good, unfinished. This shouldn't take long."
Homer,That was beautiful. Can we go now?
Homer,How much longer was Sherbert planning on making this piece of junk?
Homer,"Thanks, Flanders. Big know-it-all."
Homer,"Come on, Flanders, he's not that bad."
Homer,Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.
Homer,"Not now, Lisa."
Homer,What?
Homer,"Where, where?"
Homer,"Let the destruction begin! Hey, they forgot my corn dog."
Homer,"Here you go, Bartasaurous."
Homer,Oh I can't watch.
Homer,"Bart, Bart. We're home, son."
Homer,Kids say such stupid things.
Homer,"Come on Marge, we're mad at 'im."
Homer,Ewwww.
Homer,"Amen! Well, Bart, has Dr. Hibbert made his point?"
Homer,"Oh, hi, kids. Thanks."
Homer,"You didn't mean that. Bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises I don't expect you to keep. If you make this promise, you have to keep it."
Homer,Springfield Gorge? I thought we settled this daredevil junk.
Homer,"I can and do. Go to your room, Bart! There, I've done it. I'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all."
Homer,"He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead."
Homer,"Oh, that never works. He's a goner."
Homer,"Okay, okay. I'll try."
Homer,Bart? Bart?
Homer,Bart! What are you doing?
Homer,"You were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you?"
Homer,"Look, I know I can't stop you. The only thing I can do is ask you to promise me you won't jump the gorge."
Homer,"'Cause if you don't, I'll never believe anything you say, ever again."
Homer,"I mean it, boy."
Homer,That's my boy.
Homer,"You know, Marge, we got a pretty good kid there."
Homer,"Hey, boy. Wanna toss the old --"
Homer,Why that little liar! I should... and I was gonna play pickle with him.
Homer,BART!
Homer,"Boy, I've tried ordering you, I've tried punishing you, and God help me, I even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself."
Homer,Because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.
Homer,Don't you think I know that?
Homer,"Goodbye, son."
Homer,"Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God."
Homer,"I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --"
Homer,I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--
Homer,"You think you've got guts, try raising my kids."
Homer,"You know, Marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world."
Homer,"Marge, I'm gonna build you a spice rack!"
Homer,It's no trouble. I've got a whole garageful of tools I never use.
Homer,"Shut up, boy."
Homer,"I knew all this stuff would come in handy some day. Let's see now... ah, here it is. The Complete Handyman's Bookshelf. Volume One. Spice Rack."
Homer,Pick - up - a - ham - mer...
Homer,Wowww....
Homer,"No, I can't. It's broken."
Homer,"Keep her away from me, Marge! She's got that crazy look in her eyes again."
Homer,"You heard me. I won't be in for the rest of the week. I told you. My baby beat me up. Oh, it is not the worst excuse I ever thought up. Wise guy."
Homer,"Hey, how come you can watch cartoons but the kids can't?"
Homer,Because why?
Homer,"Because you said so, why?"
Homer,Oh. What are you doing?
Homer,"Heh, heh, heh."
Homer,"Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?"
Homer,No.
Homer,"Everybody's looking at us, Marge."
Homer,"Oh. Well, how long are we going to have to be doing this?"
Homer,I didn't know they still made TV dinners this bad.
Homer,There's peas in my fruit cobbler.
Homer,"Hey, tomorrow night, how about making some of your patented pork chops?"
Homer,Twenty million women in the world and I had to marry Jane Fonda.
Homer,"You know, some of these stories are pretty good. I never know mice lived such interesting lives."
Homer,Take that you dumb squirrel.
Homer,Where do they get their ideas?
Homer,One thousand dollars.
Homer,"Oh, sorry."
Homer,I was watching that.
Homer,"... Oh, hey, thank you, Maggie."
Homer,"Sit down, boy!"
Homer,"Wow. What great kids. This is the golden age, Marge. And the parents of Springfield owe it all to you."
Homer,"Well, I always knew you'd change the world, for the better."
Homer,"Marge, get the door."
Homer,Really? Great!
Homer,"Well, there he is... Michelangelo's Dave."
Homer,"Oh. What's wrong, Marge?"
Homer,"Hey, don't worry Marge, pretty soon every boy and girl in Springfield Elementary School is gonna come and see this thing."
Homer,They're forcing 'em.
Homer,He's awake!
Homer,"Hey, yeah! Who are you? I saw you chasing Bart's ambulance..."
Homer,"Ooo, classy."
Homer,"Well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. And besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. Nothing serious."
Homer,Wow...
Homer,"Yeah. If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr. Burns' office right now and..."
Homer,Uh-oh...
Homer,"Nice to meet you too, sir."
Homer,A hundred bucks?
Homer,"W-well... It's a v-very generous offer, sir. But... his medical bills alone..."
Homer,"You don't have to do that, Mr. Burns. I can throw myself out."
Homer,Hey! Lionel Hutz...
Homer,"You sure have got some education, Mr. Hutz."
Homer,Fifty percent?
Homer,Well... I dunno... You and I might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is.
Homer,Whoo ooo! I stand corrected. A million bucks is A-okay!
Homer,Whiplash! Oh no!
Homer,"Yes, son."
Homer,"No, of course you're not going to die. Everything's fine!"
Homer,No!
Homer,"Oh, Dr. Hibbert from Johns Hopkins Medical School?"
Homer,Just give me a ticket.
Homer,"Oh, what? What is it?"
Homer,Don't mind if I do.
Homer,"Mr. Burns, are you trying to get me drunk?"
Homer,You mean duke it out?
Homer,Five hundred thousand dollars!
Homer,"Well, Marge, what do you think?"
Homer,I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks I'm an idiot. The only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.
Homer,Five hundred thousand dollars. I spit on his five hundred thousand dollars.
Homer,"Oh, the truth!"
Homer,Will that hold up in court?
Homer,"Oh, Marge."
Homer,A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars.
Homer,"Yeah, a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman. No, thank you."
Homer,"No I don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. Uh oh I better answer. No, thank you."
Homer,"No, thank you."
Homer,"Marge, dear. Would it be all right if I went over to Moe's for a drink?"
Homer,I don't know if I'll ever come back here. Goodnight.
Homer,"Well, that's it. I guess this is the class I'm gonna die in."
Homer,"Moe, I wish he'd shut up."
Homer,"Hey, hey, guys. Knock it off. It's just my wife."
Homer,"Oh, Marge..."
Homer,"No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance."
Homer,"I'm saying... She's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. I'm not sure I love you anymore."
Homer,But don't worry. I'll never let on. I'll still do all the bed stuff. Maybe it won't be so bad.
Homer,"Alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her."
Homer,"Oh, who am I kidding? I love you more than ever."
Homer,"Sorry to scare you like that, babe."
Homer,Is it done yet? Is it done yet?
Homer,"Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? Four, three, two, one, ping!"
Homer,We have meatloaf!
Homer,"Yum. I've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, Lisa."
Homer,What are you getting at?
Homer,What are you talking about? Nobody's trying to teach you that.
Homer,"Shut up, boy."
Homer,"Tomorrow night!? Friday!? Pork chop night!? Marge, we haven't missed pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87."
Homer,"Okay, okay, okay, okay. Where do you want to go?"
Homer,Fine. We'll go to Mars.
Homer,No!
Homer,"If I said no the first time, what makes you think I'm gonna say yes the second time?"
Homer,"Oh, try me."
Homer,No.
Homer,No.
Homer,No!
Homer,No!
Homer,No!
Homer,"Oh, okay, okay!"
Homer,"Oh, okay. HELLO!"
Homer,"It's so hard to choose. It all looks so terrible. Just bring me one of these, and one of these, and one of those."
Homer,Good thing I'm open-minded.
Homer,Hmmm. Hmmm. Not bad. Interesting.
Homer,"I'll try this little pink one, here. Hmmm, very good. Another one."
Homer,"Oh boy, this fish is dee-lish!"
Homer,"... oh, oh, and two of these things."
Homer,"And, Oh, Oh, I don't believe I've tried the flying fish roe..."
Homer,You're the doctor!
Homer,There's gotta be something I haven't tried. Huh? Hey! What's this? Fugu!
Homer,"Come on, pal! Fugu me!"
Homer,I want fugu!
Homer,Mmmm. Fan-fugu-tastic.
Homer,"Beautiful language, isn't it, Marge?"
Homer,"Oh, I couldn't possibly."
Homer,Poison! What should I do? What should I do? Tell me quick!
Homer,"""Try something new, Homer. What'll it hurt you, Homer?"" I never heard of a poison pork chop."
Homer,"No need, Doc. I can read Marge like a book."
Homer,"Oooh! It's good news, isn't it?"
Homer,Twenty-four hours?
Homer,"Oh Marge, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die."
Homer,No way! Because I'm not dying.
Homer,Why you little --
Homer,What's after fear? What's after fear?
Homer,"Doc, you gotta get me out of this. I'll make it worth your while."
Homer,"Well, we all gotta go some time."
Homer,"Told ya. Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave."
Homer,So you're going to die... 
Homer,"Hello, Marge? Hello? I'm the one who's dying, not you."
Homer,Nothing. It'll just upset them. I want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.
Homer,Almost.
Homer,"I'm not done yet, Marge. What's that word you use for when you and I... you know..."
Homer,Be intimate with Marge.
Homer,"Ah, watch the sunrise."
Homer,"Till six a.m., my dearest darling and my last day on earth."
Homer,"Eleven-thirty! Oh, that's just great."
Homer,"Marge, why did you let me sleep so late?"
Homer,There'll be plenty of time for that! I've got tons of important stuff to do.
Homer,Bart! Bart!
Homer,Have man-to-man with Bart.
Homer,"Come here, boy."
Homer,"Nooo, I just want to have a heart-to-heart talk."
Homer,"You know, Bart, after me, you're the man around the house, and that means you're gonna have to help out with --"
Homer,"Shut up! Bart, this is good stuff. I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one, ""cover for me."" Number two, ""oh, good idea, boss."" Number three, ""it was like that when I got here."""
Homer,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave."
Homer,Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.
Homer,"Oh, Why you little --"
Homer,"Oh, that's my boy."
Homer,Listen to Lisa play her sax.
Homer,No. Let me hear you play.
Homer,"Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?"
Homer,"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE... OVER THERE."""
Homer,"Gee, the fun never stops at the Flanders house, does it?"
Homer,"Hey, Flanders, could I borrow your camcorder?"
Homer,"No, thanks."
Homer,"No, I don't want-a..."
Homer,"Flanders, I said I didn't -- Tomorrow? Sure, what the hey. I'd love to come to your barbecue. I'll even bring the thickest, juiciest T-bones you've ever seen."
Homer,"Heh-heh. The joke's on him, I'll be dead by then."
Homer,"I'm sorry, Officer. I know I was going too fast. Just give me a ticket."
Homer,"This is a videotape for my daughter, Maggie. Hi, Maggie. I'm speaking to you from beyond the grave. Oooooooh. Hope that didn't scare you. Well, you're a grown-up now, and unless you've taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man your father was... He was a simple man. A kind man. A gentle man who loved his children and..."
Homer,Hello? Yeah he's here who is this? Bart's friend Milhouse. Bart! Get your butt down here!
Homer,Dad --
Homer,"Dad, we've never been too close, have we?"
Homer,"Never went fishing, or played catch, or even hugged each other."
Homer,"I just want you to know that I love you, Dad."
Homer,Huh uh.
Homer,Dad!
Homer,Papa!
Homer,"My old man. Well, I gotta go."
Homer,"Well, gee, Dad, if I wasn't on such a tight schedule--"
Homer,"Well, I ... Oh, let's get some worms."
Homer,"Well, no time for that."
Homer,"Oh, I really wanted to do that one."
Homer,"Gee, Dad. Way to hog my last moments."
Homer,"Yeah, yeah. The old guy's a little love-starved."
Homer,"Get moving, you hunk of junk. I gotta make up for lost time."
Homer,"I pay my taxes and they pay your salary, so when I say ""give me a ticket"", just give me a ticket."
Homer,That's sorta nice. What are you in for?
Homer,Wait! I can't call Marge. It's our last day on earth together. I can't drag her into this mess. I know! I'll call Barney.
Homer,Damn those novelty telephone answering machine tapes!
Homer,"Thanks a lot, Barney. I just wasted my one phone call on your stupid ma--"
Homer,"You gotta help me, Barney. I'm in jail."
Homer,Ju... ju....just get over here and bring fifty bucks for bail.
Homer,"Hey, Barney, look. It was on my list, along with a lot of other things I didn't get to do today. Hey, my boss!"
Homer,"Hey, Burns! Eat my shorts!"
Homer,Wow! Of all the luck! To think I almost died without telling the boss to eat my shorts.
Homer,I gotta call Marge.
Homer,"Oh, it was busy. Moe, another last beer, please."
Homer,"Guys, keep it down. I got some last words. I never told you this before, but sometimes when I'm at work, I think of you and smile. So often I think that ... oh, words won't do it. I love you, Moe."
Homer,"I love you, Barney."
Homer,"Come on, Barney, I gotta get home."
Homer,"Faster, Barney, faster."
Homer,"Oh, I can't wait any longer. Hold on, Marge. I'm comin' home, baby."
Homer,Marge! Marge!
Homer,There's no time to explain.
Homer,Love you. Love you. Love you.
Homer,"Okay, okay."
Homer,"Oh, gimme a break, Marge."
Homer,That was beautiful.
Homer,"Goodbye, Maggie -- stay as sweet as you are."
Homer,"Goodbye, Lisa -- I know you'll make me proud."
Homer,"Goodbye, Bart -- I like your sheets."
Homer,The Good Book...
Homer, ... on tape... 
Homer,"""Oooo, as read by Larry King."""
Homer,All right. Stop it! Cut it out!
Homer,What are you talking about?
Homer,"I'm alive! I'm alive. And I couldn't be happier. From this day forward, I vow to live life to its fullest!"
Homer,"Do you two have to sit so close to the TV? Back up, or it'll hurt your eyes."
Homer,Oh yes it will.
Homer,That makes two of us.
Homer,I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
Homer,"All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery."
Homer,"Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?"
Homer,How's this?
Homer,"Okay, just everybody remain calm."
Homer,"Hey, yeah, yeah. I think I can."
Homer,She's right! She's right!
Homer,"Oh, how I miss TV! Dear, God. Just give me one channel!"
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"Ugh, gross. Ecch."
Homer,SOME PEOPLE CALL ME A SPACE COWBOY / YEAH / SOME CALL ME THE GANGSTER OF LOVE / SOME PEOPLE CALL ME MAURICE. Woo woo / 'CAUSE I SPEAK OF THE PUPPETS OH OF LOVE.
Homer,"English! Who needs that? I'm never going to England. Come on, let's go smoke."
Homer,But we're early for lunch. Let's go grab a burger.
Homer,"Eh, it's my metabmobolism. I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones."
Homer,"Hey, don't worry Barney. It's a big school. There's gotta be a girl nobody else wants to take to the prom."
Homer,I... I don't know!
Homer,She's mine!
Homer,"So, what are you in for?"
Homer,"Well, I'm here for being me. Every day I show up, act like me, and they slap me in here."
Homer,I haven't seen you in school before.
Homer,What?
Homer,Maybe we should get together some time.
Homer,I'm Homer.
Homer,J.
Homer,Simpson.
Homer,It was worth it.
Homer,"I'd reached step one: She knew I existed. The only problem was, she didn't care."
Homer,Nothing.
Homer,"Dad, I'm in love."
Homer,"But, Dad, I don't drink..."
Homer,Uh-huh.
Homer,"Oh, yeah."
Homer,"Thanks, Pop."
Homer,"Hi, I'm Homer Simpson. I need some guidance, counselor."
Homer,"Well, yeah, maybe, but I just met this girl, Marge Bouvier and I want to force her to like me."
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Well, what interest does she have that I could make common?"
Homer,Far out!
Homer,Me? I'm gonna drink a lot of beer and stay out all night.
Homer,"Me, in a nuclear power plant... Kaboom!"
Homer,My name's Homer Simpson. I'd like to sign up for something.
Homer,"Debate? Like, arguing?"
Homer,"I'll take that, you stinkpot! Just warming up, Mrs. Bloominstein."
Homer,"Fifty-five! That's ridiculous! Sure, they'll save a few lives. But millions will be late!"
Homer,No Way.
Homer,Ignoramus.
Homer,Wait a minute! That word you keep calling me --
Homer,Ignoramus. It means I'm stupid! Doesn't it?
Homer,Not to me there isn't!
Homer,You ignoramus.
Homer,"No, you..."
Homer,With pleasure.
Homer,Hel-lo.
Homer,"Oh, you may not remember me. I'm Homer Simpson. I mooned for rebuttal."
Homer,So... you wanna go out with me?
Homer,"Well, a... You see the problem is, you don't know me. I have references. Just ask Coach Flanagan, and ask Mr. Seckofsky and Barney Gumbel."
Homer,"Look, I'm not asking you to like me, I'm not asking you to put yourself in a position where I can touch your goodies, I'm just asking you to be fair."
Homer,"Well, what's the good word?"
Homer,What?
Homer,I'm... a spare. Excuse me.
Homer,What?
Homer,"Yeah, so...."
Homer,You tutor?
Homer,And anyone can be tooted?
Homer,French. What a coincidence. Just the subject I'm having trouble with.
Homer,"Bart, pay attention. You may be telling this to your own son one day if something breaks."
Homer,"Ooh, lost a few. Oh, well there's plenty more where that came from. Uh-oh, a zit. No problemo."
Homer,The perfect crime.
Homer,Hel - lo.
Homer,It helps me study. Heh-heh-heh.
Homer,Cray-on.
Homer,Fenetre.
Homer,Femme.
Homer,"Oh.... wait, Don't go. Don't go. Wait, wait -- why don't we take a little study break?"
Homer,Do the hustle!
Homer,ALLOUETTE JAUNTE ALLOUETTE / ALLOUETTE JAUNTE...
Homer,"I can't believe it, it's sticking. You're telling me new stuff, and minutes later it's still there! And it's all thanks to you. Marge, when I see you forming the vowels and continents --"
Homer,"Marge, would you go to the prom with me?"
Homer,"I'll take that as a compliment. So, will you go out with me? Please say oui."
Homer,"Ohhh! oh, Marge! This'll be the greatest night of your life. I've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but I'm gonna spend it all on us. I'm renting the biggest limo. I'm gonna buy you the biggest corsage. My tux is gonna have the widest lapels, the most ruffles, and the highest platform shoes you ever saw."
Homer,"Wait, wait, wait, Marge. If honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. I'm not really in any French class. This was just a brilliant scheme to get to know you better."
Homer,Ow.
Homer,"Hey, Barney, guess whose got a date for the prom?"
Homer,Is Marge here?
Homer,I'm her date.
Homer,"Oh, okay."
Homer,"Thanks, Mr. B."
Homer,You said you'd go to the prom with me.
Homer,"I was afraid you'd cancel our date so I stayed away from you completely, even though it meant skipping school for three weeks and graduating this summer... I hope."
Homer,She's with him.
Homer,"Hey, I paid for this car. I paid for this tuxedo and I paid for the two dinners. We're going to the prom."
Homer,"You wish, Dondelinger."
Homer,"One of each, please."
Homer,Barney!
Homer,"Oh, isn't she great? Hail Queen Marge! Woo woo! Long live the Queen!"
Homer,I gotta get outta here.
Homer,What?
Homer,"Because I'm sure we were meant to be together. Usually when I have a thought there's a lot of other thoughts in there. Something says yes, something says no. But this time there's only yes. How could the only thing I've ever been sure about in my life be wrong?"
Homer,Inspiration Point.
Homer,"Naw, that's okay. I'm broke. I'll walk home."
Homer,Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
Homer,"All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!"
Homer,Marge?
Homer,Sure.
Homer,Who? Oh.
Homer,"Marge, pour vous."
Homer,"I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go."
Homer,And I never have.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Hey, Flanders. Who put that bug up your butt?"
Homer,"Boy, what's this world coming to?"
Homer,Gotta go.
Homer,"Hey, stop, cable man! Stop!"
Homer,I want free cable.
Homer,"So this is okay, I mean everybody does it, right?"
Homer,So You've Decided To Steal Cable.
Homer,"""Myth: Cable piracy is wrong. Fact: Cable companies are big faceless corporations, which makes it okay."""
Homer,Cable. It's more wonderful than I dared hope.
Homer,It's funny 'cause it's true!
Homer,"Oh, hey, hey. Family, family, come here. I have an announcement to make. The Simpsons have cable."
Homer,That's right. Sixty-eight channels. MTV for the kids. VH-1 for us. Sixteen hundred hours of quality programming every day!
Homer,"Nothing a month? Yeah, I think we can swing that."
Homer,"Don't worry, Marge. Take a look at this."
Homer,Marge --
Homer,Hear Me Roar -- The Network For Women.
Homer,"Oooo. Pro wrestling from Mexico. You know, down there it's a real sport."
Homer,They must think people will watch anything.
Homer,"Huh, wha'? Oh, okay."
Homer,Oooh. Pizza.
Homer,Bart!
Homer,The lad has a point.
Homer,"Read the pamphlet, honey."
Homer,"Oh, goody! A program-length advertisements!"
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"Oh, great... All right, what makes you say that?"
Homer,"Well, duh."
Homer,"Oh. Hm, look at it this way. When you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?"
Homer,And did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?
Homer,"Well, run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the Feds."
Homer,"Well, thank you honey."
Homer,Whooo!
Homer,"Oh, boy!"
Homer,How can one little insulated wire bring so much happiness?
Homer,"We could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable TV."
Homer,"Pass the pumice, please."
Homer,"Yeah, that's right. Eight o'clock, my place. Come one, come all."
Homer,"Yeah, Friday night. You want to come over?"
Homer,"Oh, too bad. It's gonna be a great fight."
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. It's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. I want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again."
Homer,Promise me.
Homer,Good boy.
Homer,Hey Lisa -- Racing from Belmont? Horsies!
Homer,"There is something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like... well, not like Bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium."
Homer,Unhook it?! But I love cable.
Homer,"Look, look, Marge. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't, so I'm not going to."
Homer,"Marge, I never put my foot down about anything."
Homer,...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.
Homer,"Marge, I'm sorry, I think it's coming down."
Homer,"It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge. It's coming down. The cable stays. The foot has spoken."
Homer,Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Ugh! Soccer. Seen it.
Homer,"Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here?"
Homer,Get out of my house! I don't wanna associate with criminals.
Homer,He's not home.
Homer,"Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff."
Homer,Huh? What the? I know you -- come back here...
Homer,"Bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! Now go to your room."
Homer,Oh great.
Homer,Just a select circle of my friends.
Homer,"Oh, didja swipe those from work?"
Homer,"Quick, it's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs..."
Homer,"All right, will you... Hey, go protest outside will ya, now!."
Homer,"Oooh, thank you, Moe! I always wanted one of these."
Homer,"Mr. Burns! Bart... quick. Hide the stuff I ""borrowed"" from work."
Homer,"All right, the stuff I stole from work!"
Homer,"Now, c'mon. Take all this, and this, put it in the closet."
Homer,Will you quit staring at me like that!
Homer,"Ugh, ah, hello, Mr. Burns. Would you like to watch the fight?"
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"No... No I... It wasn't me... It was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... I would never..."
Homer,"Oh, sure, sure. Be my guest."
Homer,"Oh, no."
Homer,"Marge, Lisa, Maggie..."
Homer,"Come on, boy."
Homer,"Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know I've made a couple of really important decisions. Number one: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. And Number Two: I'm not very fond of any of you."
Homer,"Yeah, at the worst possible time."
Homer,The greatest fight ever and I missed it.
Homer,"Cable clippers, please."
Homer,Oops.
Homer,Third time's the charm.
Homer,Ooh! Barbecue!
Homer,This is like some beautiful dream.
Homer,"Marge, honey, I've got five words to say to you. Greasy Joe's Bottomless Bar-B-Q Pit."
Homer,"Marge, I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll unload the kids on Patty and Selma Saturday night. And then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. Just like old times."
Homer,I'll take that bet.
Homer,"I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me."
Homer,"Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! No Barney, that's just my sister-in-law."
Homer,Remember? Who could forget?
Homer,But that was just an idle promise.
Homer,Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?
Homer,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched."
Homer,But Marge...
Homer,All right.
Homer,Okay.
Homer,Hey! Why should she have a better husband than you do?
Homer,Must find man. Must find man. Must find man.
Homer,"Boy, a good man really is hard to find."
Homer,"One seafood burrito, Apu."
Homer,Sorry.
Homer,What is it this time?
Homer,"But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skinner, are you married?"
Homer,"But if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?"
Homer,"Oh, no reason, really. I was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. A payback for all the crummy things Bart has done to your school."
Homer,Excellent.
Homer,"Heh heh heh. Here we go. Boy meets beast. Principal Skinner, allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely and available sister, Selma."
Homer,Wha...?
Homer,"Oh yes, plenty of fish. We just don't have any bait."
Homer,"Ah, Moe. I've gotta find a date for my big, fat, snotty sister-in-law, Selma."
Homer,Like my wife's ugly sister.
Homer,"Hey, Selma's no prize pig herself you know."
Homer,"But' nothing, Marge. She's a heifer, plain and simple."
Homer,"Oh, there's the little prom queen now."
Homer,Is that Selma? Ring-a-ding-ding!
Homer,"Take it to the hoop, Selma."
Homer,"... And thank you most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single proven fatality, at least in this country. Amen."
Homer,"Quiet, you kids! If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch cartoons and Lisa doesn't get to go to college."
Homer,Not one word.
Homer,I thought I said knock it off!
Homer,"Well, no panta-ma-mime, either."
Homer,The hospital? Y'ello... Oh my God!
Homer,"What is it, Da --"
Homer,"Oh Dad, you and your imagination."
Homer,A half-brother?
Homer,"This makes me feel special, Dad. Since I'm the one you kept, that must mean you really love me."
Homer,"I'm going to find my brother. I don't care what it takes. If I have to move heaven and earth, I'm going to find him!"
Homer,Bart!
Homer,I guess he's got us there.
Homer,Bart!
Homer,Twen... forty-eight. This is it.
Homer,"Excuse me, is this an orphanage?"
Homer,"Thirty years! I'll never find him. I'm doomed to walk through this life alone. Oh brother, where art thou?!"
Homer,"Oh. Hee, hee. Sorry."
Homer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I wish I could help you but we're looking for my brother today. Can you tell me his name?"
Homer,Herbert. Herbert Powell. Great! Where can I find him?
Homer,"Oh please, please, this is my life we're talking about here. Please..."
Homer,"I know, he could be anywhere! That's why I want you to narrow it down! Please..."
Homer,"Well, if you ask me, changing the subject makes you the most worthless, heartless, excuse for a human being I ever..."
Homer,"Oh, oh... I get it. Okay. Here's twenty bucks. Now will you tell me where my brother lives?"
Homer,Just take it and tell me!
Homer,Fine. Thank you.
Homer,"Let's see, Powell, Powell... Powell... Pomerant, Poole, Popkin, Potter, Quigley, Quimby, Randolph... whoops, too far. Here it is, Powell."
Homer,"No, I've called all three Herbert Powells in Detroit. Nothing."
Homer,"H! Of course. That could stand for Herbert! It's a long shot, but..."
Homer,"Hello, is this H. Powell of Detroit, Michigan?"
Homer,By any chance does the H stand for Herbert?
Homer,"Woo woo! The H stands for Herbert! Herb, were you adopted?"
Homer,From the Shelbyville Orphanage?
Homer,"Because... ... I'm your baby brother, Homer!"
Homer,Hello? Hello? Hello? Stupid phone!
Homer,"Oh, sorry."
Homer,"Okay, Brother! Grab the next plane to Springfield. We got a couch that folds out..."
Homer,Just a little further. Just a little further. Just a little further. Just a little further.
Homer,"But Marge, I want to see my brother--"
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"That's okay, carry on. See the way I handled that, Marge?"
Homer,What does it look like?
Homer,"Marge, this can't be the right address."
Homer,Hello in there.
Homer,Herb?
Homer,Holy moly! The bastard's rich!
Homer,"Herb, allow me to introduce my family. This is my wife, Marge..."
Homer,"... and our three children, Bart, Lisa and Maggie."
Homer,"Yeah, though the boy was a close call."
Homer,What's to know? Just dive in. Catch!
Homer,I feel the same about you.
Homer,Even pork chops?
Homer,"You mean, if I want pork chops -- even in the middle of the night -- your guy'll fry 'em up?"
Homer,"Wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. Let me see if I got this straight... It's Christmas day, four a.m., there's a rumble in my stomach..."
Homer,Will you kids shut up?
Homer,"Okay, we're watching."
Homer,"Hello, Cook? Sorry to bother you so late, but I got a hankerin' for some... that's right... don't forget the apple sauce!"
Homer,Are you sure you want to give me a car?
Homer,"Oh, okay. I'd like a big one, then."
Homer,Why not?
Homer,"Well, then give me one with lots of pep."
Homer,America.
Homer,You do.
Homer,And I want to let you!!
Homer,"Hi'ya, team."
Homer,I dunno.
Homer,What's that?
Homer,"All right. Wooo, what's that doohickey?"
Homer,"Oh yeah, he did!"
Homer,"Oh, okay."
Homer,"Ugh, oh boy."
Homer,Oh fine. We're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...
Homer,Huh?
Homer,"Uh, yeah, I think I did."
Homer,"Uh, may I be excused, please?"
Homer,Because you think I'm a genius?
Homer,Because you think I'm dynamic?
Homer,You think I work well with others?
Homer,"Oh, great."
Homer,"Ah, Unky Herb, I don't know anything about cars."
Homer,Sort of.
Homer,What?
Homer,Sort of!
Homer,All right you eggheads! I want a place in this car to put my drink!
Homer,Hel-lo? Hel-lo Einstein? I said a place to put my drink. You know those Super Slakers they sell at the Kwik-E-Mart? The cup is this big!
Homer,And I'm not done yet. You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car.
Homer,And some things are so snazzy they never go out of style! Like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!
Homer,"I want a horn here, here and here. You can never find a horn when you're mad. And they should all play ""La Cucaracha."""
Homer,"And sometimes, the kids are in the back seat, they're hollering, they're making you nuts. There's got to be something you can do about that."
Homer,You're fired! What is my brother paying you for?
Homer,"Bullseye! And another thing. When I gun the motor, I want people to think the world is coming to an end! VROOM! VROOM! VROOM!"
Homer,No! No! No! No! No!
Homer,"All my life, I have searched for a car that feels a certain way."
Homer,"Powerful, like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding, like a Nerf ball. Now, at last, I have found it."
Homer,"Gee, Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all your possessions. I can't help but think that maybe you would have been better off if I'd never come into your life."
Homer,Ooo.
Homer,"Get in, Dad. I'll explain on the way home."
Homer,"What is it, boy?"
Homer,"Thanks, boy. I was waiting for someone to say that."
Homer,"No! No! No! Bad dog! Let go! Bad Santa's Little Helper! Stop it! No, not the sports section! No!"
Homer,Stupid dog.
Homer,No! Stay away! This is not for you! This is Homer food.
Homer,"Marge, the dog is hungry!"
Homer,"Yes, Master."
Homer,Y'ello.
Homer,"Oh, are you? Well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard."
Homer,"Are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? I am going to explain this to you one more time, and then I am going to hang up on you. It is not my dog. I tied my dog outside myself. I am looking at him right --"
Homer,"Hey Lenny, I need to leave early. Cover for me, will ya?"
Homer,"Well, well. Mr. Universe takes a walk. Haw, haw!"
Homer,"Look at that get-up. Heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and ... Assassins!"
Homer,Oooh! Oooh! How much? How much? How much?
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"Y'ello, Hi, Lisa, what's wrong? The mumps? Oooh, the kissing disease! My little girl is growing up."
Homer,"So what does my little girl want? What? Let me write this down. Copies of ""Teen Dream... Teen Scream... and Teen Steam Magazine."" Well, okay. You're the sickie. Goodbye, Lisa."
Homer,"Oh man, two dollars. Uh, I'll take these three... They're for my daughter."
Homer,Assassins!
Homer,"Oh, a hundred and twenty-five bucks!"
Homer,But I can't afford to...
Homer,"Okay, Flanders, you're the boss. Heh, heh, heh."
Homer,Here's your magazines. How many of these guys are named Corey?
Homer,"Yep! Hee, hee. Read 'em and weep."
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"Well, you bought all those smoke alarms and we haven't had a single fire."
Homer,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Homer,I've changed my mind. I decided I don't want these shoes.
Homer,"Well, my faithful dog was bringing me my shoes and they fell apart in his mouth."
Homer,Big cookie.
Homer,"Well, aloha!"
Homer,The price is right.
Homer,Mmmm. Macamadamia nuts.
Homer,"Oh, so that's your little plan! Get us addicted, then jack up the price! Well, you win."
Homer,Property of Hom-er J. Simp-son. Hands off.
Homer,"Now Marge, honey, honey, honey. Come on. Come on, don't get upset. It's not the end of the world. We all loved that quilt, but you can't get too attached to..."
Homer,"No, MY COOKIE!"
Homer,This is not happening! This is not happening!
Homer,Everybody in the kitchen! We're having a family meeting!
Homer,We never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.
Homer,I'm saying...
Homer,Bart!
Homer,"You do? Ha ha, ha ha ha!"
Homer,No.
Homer,"Oh Lisa, if they're ever going to pull the plug on me, I want you in my corner, honey."
Homer,"No, we have to commit ourselves. Now take this down. ""Free to loving home. World's most brilliant dog. Says 'I love you' on command."""
Homer,Type! Type!
Homer,"Oh no, we'd never give him away, but, we're moving to another country where dogs are forbidden. Hear what? Oh, sure. C'mere, boy! Put that prowler down. Come here! Come on boy! Say it, boy! Say ""I love you"" for the nice man! I lub you. Good dog! Good doggie! Isn't that amazing? See you soon. Woooo! Wooo!"
Homer,"Uh, you can pick him up tomorrow."
Homer,"Dad, the next time we see you we'll do something more fun."
Homer,"Stop it, both of you. Grampa smells like a regular old man, which is more like a hallway in a hospital."
Homer,"My God, you're right, Marge. You kids wouldn't put me in a home like I did to my dad, would you?"
Homer,"Marge, what do we do?"
Homer,"Absolutely. Our third Sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. Where's some place fun we can take Grampa next time?"
Homer,No.
Homer,He can't ride ponies.
Homer,"Oh, we saw that."
Homer,"No, Bart. No!"
Homer,I got it. The Springfield Mystery Spot.
Homer,Dad! It's the third Sunday of the month. You know what that means.
Homer,"Oh, come on, Dad, I promise we'll have more fun this time. We're gonna see lions."
Homer,"Oh, you have a girlfriend. Heh, heh, heh."
Homer,"Well, Happy Birthday, Bea. She can come with us. Hey, there's room for all your friends in the car."
Homer,"Yeah, right."
Homer,"Hey you kids, stop kicking the seat!"
Homer,"Well, let 'em sleep on their own time!"
Homer,"Bart, get out and push."
Homer,"I can't tell you how sorry I am, Dad."
Homer,Oh no! Dad's lost his hearing.
Homer,Yell-o.
Homer,Whoo-hoo. It's Dad. Dad's on the phone. He's calling me.
Homer,"Oh Dad. Oh, I knew you'd forgive me."
Homer,I miss my Daddy.
Homer,Huh?
Homer,Dad!
Homer,"Well... sure. We'll have to move a chair in from the den, but it's no problem. Bart!"
Homer,"Pass the bug juice, Dad."
Homer,"Bart! Forgive him, Dad. He's just a stupid little kid who says the first thing that pops into his head. But, you know, there's wisdom in his innocence."
Homer,"Yes, I do."
Homer,"Miss, I'm looking for Abe Simpson."
Homer,It's important I get a hold of him. I have to tell him I don't care about his money and I love him.
Homer,Casino?
Homer,"A double cheese burger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and for God's sakes, hurry!"
Homer,"Excuse me. Excuse me, have you seen an old man with a lot of money? He looks like me, but he's wrinkled? Hello, have you seen a..."
Homer,Dad! Noooooooooo!
Homer,Holy Moly! You're winning!
Homer,"Dad! Please, you gotta quit while you're ahead. You understand that, take all your money and leave now."
Homer,But you could lose everything. Come on.
Homer,You'll be a bonehead. Come on.
Homer,"Dad, no! Gimme that."
Homer,Gimme me that money. Ow! You're hurting me.
Homer,"So, have you figured out who gets the money?"
Homer,"If I take you, will you two SHUT UP AND QUIT BUGGING ME?"
Homer,YES!!!
Homer,"Heads up, kids. I'm moving the seat back."
Homer,"All right, everybody stick together. We don't want to get separated..."
Homer,The hell with this.
Homer,"Slide inspector comin' through! Please move to the right. Grab that handrail, young man. Outta my way, I'm here for your safety."
Homer,Oh no! Urg... Arrrgh. C'mon you stupid tube!!!
Homer,OH NOOOOOO!!!!
Homer,I... can't... breathe! Too... many... children...!
Homer,"All right family, I want the truth. Don't pull any punches. Am I just a little bit overweight?"
Homer,"Well, am I?"
Homer,"Four Hundred and thirty-seven. Fifty-five. Oh my God, three hundred and... Hey, a hundred and fifty. Oh God, it's two hundred and sixty pounds! I'm a big fat pig."
Homer,"Marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bone."
Homer,"But I'm going on a diet. From this day forward I pledge there will be no pork chop too succulent, no donut too tasty, no pizza too laden with delicious toppings, to prevent me from reaching my scientifically determined ideal weight! As God is my witness, I'll always be hungry again!"
Homer,"Oh, shut up."
Homer,"This old attic's kinda spooky, isn't it boy. I said, isn't it, boy?"
Homer,Don't you ever do that to me again.
Homer,Bart!
Homer,Get away from that thing and help me find my athletic equipment.
Homer,"Ooh, the Glutimus Maximizer."
Homer,"Don't you know anything, boy? That's Ringo Starr."
Homer,"Your mother must have painted this. I guess she thought he was cute... Hey, what the..."
Homer,Marge!
Homer,Likely story.
Homer,"Oh, why did I have to start my diet on pork chop night?"
Homer,"Well, wait a minute. Hey, I've been setting my drinks on these things."
Homer,Hello? Hello? Hello taste... where are you?
Homer,"Hey, hey, now you're talkin'!"
Homer,Do I have to do anything?
Homer,"Great, fine, go nuts!"
Homer,"Mmm, only thirty-five calories."
Homer,"I can't move, boy."
Homer,"Woo-ooo! I'm a work of art! ""Last Supper"", eat your heart out!"
Homer,Woo woo! Two forty nine! Yeah!
Homer,"Marge, Marge. Look at me! My clothes are just hanging off me!"
Homer,What a family.
Homer,"Honey, I'm home!"
Homer,"Oh, isn't that wonderful. My work and my home life come together in such a nice way. Marge, may I see you in the other room?"
Homer,"Honey, he's nuts. He thinks he's handsome. Please, make him look handsome. Please, please, please, please..."
Homer,"All right, all right, who took the funny pages?"
Homer,"All right, scale. You don't like me and I don't like you, but I've been very good, so you better treat me right."
Homer,All right! Woo woo! Woo woo!
Homer,Marge! I'm two-thirty-nine and I'm feeling fine! Look! I'm using the original notches that came with my belt.
Homer,"If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator."
Homer,No. Burns is right. What's the use?
Homer,Marge.
Homer,"Yeah, well, just so long as you paint a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow."
Homer,"What?! Marge, you have to."
Homer,"Hello, what's this?"
Homer,"It's for you, Marge. From merry old England."
Homer,"Come on, Marge. Paint. I think you can do it."
Homer,A book made him cry! Boo hoo hoo!
Homer,Wow! You made the front page.
Homer,"Just a popularity contest?! Excuse me, what's more important than popularity? Now, Bart, do you really think you can win?"
Homer,"Woo woo! All right! I always knew you had personality. The doctors said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better. President Simpson. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?"
Homer,"Now, go get 'em."
Homer,The Museum!
Homer,"Tomorrow... ugh; oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on... sleeping... eating a big sandwich... watching T.V... spending some time with the boy. Spending time with the boy. The boy needs attention, Marge."
Homer,"Shut up, boy."
Homer,"Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because... you're trapped. If you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! All right! I'll take her. Lousy brain."
Homer,"Hey, what do you mean by, ""Suggested Donation""?"
Homer,"And what if I ""wish"" to pay zero?"
Homer,"Oooh, so it's up to me, is it?"
Homer,"I see, and you think that people are gonna pay you four dollars and fifty cents, even though they don't have to, just out of the goodness of their... Well, anything you say! Good luck, lady! You're gonna need it!"
Homer,Hey! You don't have to pay! Read the sign!
Homer,"Ohh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than of the Wolf Man."
Homer,She said that?
Homer,"But you can tell, right? She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, ""Why me? What did I do to deserve this fat old piece of -- """
Homer,"Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A."
Homer,Great. But don't tell her it was a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.
Homer,You are smooth. I'll give you that.
Homer,Uh-oh.
Homer,"Hey, good evening, Hezron, Carver of Graven Images."
Homer,"Been a little slow these past few months. Not much to steal in the desert, you know."
Homer,"Heh, heh, heh, heh."
Homer,"Ah, good evening, Zohar the Adulterer. My wife sends her warmest regards."
Homer,"Thank you, my lusty friend."
Homer,"Quick, everybody look busy."
Homer,"Hey, Moses, keep 'em comin'."
Homer,Oh my God! A naked celebrity. Be cool. Don't stare at his famous wang.
Homer,"Thinking is your department, jerk! That's what I pay you in beer for!"
Homer,What? Where're your going? I--
Homer,Oooh.
Homer,Ahhh.
Homer,"Come on, family. Let's go celebrate our new found ability to express love for each other. I'm taking you out for frosty chocolate milkshakes!"
Homer,Mmm... bacon.
Homer,Now how about a hug?
Homer,It's a deal!
Homer,Tell a lie. Tell a lie.
Homer,Don't tell him. Give him a fake name.
Homer,Don't you get it? You gotta use a reverse psychology.
Homer,Okay. Don't use reverse psychology.
Homer,Donald Trump? No. Arnold Palmer? No. Bill Cosby? No.
Homer,Bravo!
Homer,Uh-oh. I don't understand a word he's saying. Why doesn't he just let me bat? I wish I was home with a big bag of potato chips... Mmm potato chips.
Homer,I want some peanuts.
Homer,Don't tell him you were at a bar! But what else is open at night?
Homer,I would'a never thought of that.
Homer,What does that mean? Better say something or they'll think you're stupid.
Homer,Swish!
Homer,"I thought this thing was going to be catered. Boy, am I hungry. I mean I'm really, really hungry."
Homer,Pick up Bart! Pick up Bart!
Homer,Don't say revenge. Don't say revenge.
Homer,"That's it, I'm getting outta here."
Homer,"""Special Day?"" Oh, what have I forgotten now? Now, don't panic... Is it Bacon Day? No, that's crazy talk... She's getting impatient, take a stab at it."
Homer,"Little do they know, I'm ducking out early to take the Duff Brewery tour."
Homer,"Heh, heh, heh, they don't suspect a thing. Well, off to the plant."
Homer,Uh-oh. Did I say that or just think it?
Homer,Don't think about beer.
Homer,Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me?
Homer,Wait a minute. Is he coming on to me?
Homer,"Oh my God, he is coming on to me."
Homer,Yikes!
Homer,"Oh man, I've really got to go to the bathroom. Why did I have all that beer and coffee and watermelon?"
Homer,"This is it, Homer. It's time to tell her the terrible secret from your past."
Homer,"No, the other secret."
Homer,Don't panic. Just come up with a good story.
Homer,Twenty dollars can buy many peanuts.
Homer,Money can be exchanged for goods and services.
Homer,Wait. Are you sure that's how this sort of thing works?
Homer,Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts! Think unsexy thoughts!
Homer,"""You will find happiness with a new love."" Oh, even the Chinese are against me. What's the point. I can't fight fate."
Homer,"Mental note: ""The girl knows too much."""
Homer,"Something was said: not good. What was it? ""Don't yell at Homer."" No, that's okay. What was it? ""Slow."" They called you ""slow!"""
Homer,Something said: not good...
Homer,Eatthepuddingeatthepudding eatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthe pudding.
Homer,Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts! Think unsexy thoughts!
Homer,You will find happiness with a new love.
Homer,Quiet! It might be you. I can't remember.
Homer,"No, no! Why embarrass us both? Just write a check and I'll release some more endorphins."
Homer,"I've worked here for ten years, and my boss doesn't even know my name? Well, that's gonna change right now. My name is Homer J. Simp--"
Homer,"I'm a big four-eyed lame-o and I wear the same stupid sweater every day, and..."
Homer,Silence you fool! It can be ours.
Homer,Oh glory of glories! Oh heavenly testament to the eternal majesty of God's creation!
Homer,Now she'll really be surprised when she opens that ironing board cover!
Homer,"There it is, Homer: the cleverest thing you'll ever say. And nobody heard it."
Homer,Mental note: steal his idea.
Homer,That cactus is right. I've only got one chance. I got to knock him out.
Homer,"You can stay, but I'm leaving."
Homer,"Quiet, you fool. You're on the one team that can't possibly be fired."
Homer,"Mmm. Look at his eyes. He's trying to hypnotize me, but not in the good Las Vegas way."
Homer,"Oh, you don't want to know what I really think. Now, look sad and say ""D'oh."""
Homer,You're leaving the arm there too long! You wanna make it worse?!
Homer,"No, no! He'll know you're on to him -- quick, shake his hand!"
Homer,As...? As...?!
Homer,Just don't bump me on your way out of the car.
Homer,Keep looking shocked and move slowly towards the cake.
Homer,I've already gone this far... I wonder what my life would be like if I robbed the Kwik-E- Mart?
Homer,No! Must resist temptation!
Homer,Bo-ring.
Homer,Wow. That saxophone would make a great pipe.
Homer,Don't you get it? They're using us as patsies to make the Army look good.
Homer,"A cookie! No, a car! No, a cookie!"
Homer,I'm not thinking. You think.
Homer,"You have to think, it's your job."
Homer,You idiot! Mr. Fatso is you!
Homer,"That's right, numbskull! Your son's made a fool of you in front of the whole town!"
Homer,"Well, I'll fix you. Go drive a car!"
Homer,What the hell are you doing?!
Homer,I'm doing the best with what I got! All you feed me is reality shows!
Homer,I really wish I had fixed that faucet.
Homer,"Okay Homer, don't speak. If you must make a sound, whistle."
Homer,"When your wife looks at you, full of hope, with an idea that would destroy life as we know it..."
Homer,"Just smile, nod... and stall, stall, stall..."
Homer,...until she changes her mind.
Homer,"All right! ""Try it"" means sex."
Homer,"Okay, Homer. This is the moment of truth. You've gotta tell Marge you really don't want another kid."
Homer,"Eh, how bad could it be?"
Homer,"Uh-oh. She's picked names? Who puts this much thought into having a baby? Stall, stall, stall!"
Homer,"There he is. The fat, pathetic slob I'd be with four kids."
Homer,"Oh, right. That dad was there all along. Phew. That was so sweet! Maybe there's no such thing as too many kids."
Homer,Don't blow the surprise. Pretend you forgot.
Homer,"Uh-oh. If you're honest, you'll have to tell her about the train!"
Homer,How stupid are you?
Homer,Just for that I'm not going to help you.
Homer,"Homer Simpson! Do you really want to keep cheating your friends, lying to your wife, and avoiding your kids? What would Jesus do?"
Homer,"This simulation has been brought to you by your brain, a subsidiary of your penis."
Homer,"Homer, that's a terrible thing to say."
Homer,"Yes, sir."
Homer,"Ooh, these cotton-poly blends are sooo comfortable!"
Homer,You cool it -- I'm hungry!
Homer,Dammit!
Homer,"Remember the family jewels, son."
Homer,Food goes in here.
Homer,"Oh man, I want to kiss her. Wait -- I just thought of the greatest move ever!"
Homer,How am I supposed to kiss those things? Interrupt her with something witty!
Homer,"Kiss her already. What, are you chicken? Bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok!"
Homer,Holy macaroni!
Homer,"Hm... what to do, what to do?"
Homer,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as happy as me? Well, you've got the power inside you right now. So use it. And send one dollar to Happy Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield. Don't delay! Eternal happiness is just a dollar away."
Homer,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as happy as me? Well, you've got the power inside you right... Etc."
Homer,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as..."
Homer,"Greetings, friend..."
Homer,Friend...
Homer,"Greetings, friend..."
Homer,"Hello, this is Homer Simpson, a.k.a. ""Happy Dude."" The court has ordered me to call every person in town to apologize for my telemarketing scam. I'm sorry. If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, send one dollar to Sorry Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield... You have the power."
Homer,Woo hoo!
Homer,Mmm... ham.
Homer,"Wow, I do look pretty calm down there."
Homer,Go ahead! Give in! Beer! Beer!
Homer,Don't be the boy. Don't be the boy.
Homer,"Yeah, the legend of the dog-faced woman!"
Homer,Or was it?
Homer,What train?
Homer,Marge thinks Flanders is annoying. This marriage just got interesting.
Homer,She's so cute...
Homer,Wow. Bart has feelings. Mrs. Doody.
Homer,"No cops in sight. If I'm gonna save that clerk, I'm gonna have to take the law into my own hands again."
Homer,"Lord, this is a dire emergency. If you could fix my house, or make a new house from one of my ribs..."
Homer,Now for that happy period between the lie and the time it's found out.
Homer,Mirror mirror on the wall: who's the baldest of them all?
Homer,"Gee, I thought I had a bigger package than that."
Homer,Don't worry -- they're just friends. There's nothing physical between them.
Homer,"Uh-oh! I'm gonna have to work on my marriage. Or, alternatively..."
Homer,Wait a minute. These guys don't know me. I can be whatever I want.
Homer,"She's right, it was all me!"
Homer,"Oh man, what do I do? Wait -- the book Marge gave me!"
Homer,No book is gonna make my daughter sad. Time to do what I do best: lie to a child.
Homer,"It's poison! Whatever you do, don't eat it."
Homer,"Okay, you're already eating it, but don't finish it. Okay, you finished it, but don't ask for--"
Homer,You moron! Just kill her!
Homer,"Play it cool, Homer. Don't let her know it's perfect."
Homer,A million dollars -- now I'm really glad I didn't die!
Homer,"Wait... if I tell Marge I won, she'll know I was buying the ticket when I was supposed to be onstage with her. I'm rich and I can't even tell my own wife!"
Homer,"Calm down, Homer. Calm down."
Homer,Got to stay mad. The next morning is where the fight is won or lost.
Homer,I'm buying it!
Homer,"Okay, just imagine she's a Bond girl."
Homer,Judi Dench?!
Homer,Oh my God... is she flirting with me?
Homer,"She is flirting with me. Okay, Homer, let her down easy. Don't go breaking any hearts."
Homer,Grampa?!
Homer,No I haven't!
Homer,"Oh my God, Marge is here! What is she thinking now?"
Homer,"You have regrets, Mr. ""I Get To See The Weathergirl From The Side?"" I made the worst financial decision of all time. Oh, I can't think about it, I won't think about it, I don't want to think about it..."
Homer,Don't eat it. It's been in his ear. Don't eat it. It's been in his ear.
Homer,Don't eat it. It's been in the boy's ear and the dog's mouth. Don't eat it.
Homer,Finally. Time for the big bump-into.
Homer,Wednesday?
Homer,"Okay, she's always in a good mood after therapy..."
Homer,Except that you're about to double-cross some gangsters.
Homer,She'll forgive me...
Homer,Especially this time...
Homer,I mean it's Christmas...
Homer,I wonder if there's birds on the moon. I miss Marge.
Homer,"Whoa, he's getting serious. Is this what I really want?"
Homer,Going somewhere?
Homer,...Lisa Simpson.
Homer,...McNuggets.
Homer,Maggie.
Homer,...Lisa Simpson.
Homer,"...McNuggets. Mmm, McNuggets."
Homer,...magazines.
Homer,"You have reached the office of Homer Simpson. If you are calling about the waterbed, please leave a detailed message. If you need--"
Homer,What do your rules say now?
Homer,"Pistols at dawn?! Oh, why did I have to slap a guy who says ""suh""?"
Homer,"I love you, Homer... I love you too, Homer... Oh, Homer."
Homer,"Welcome to our tropical paradise. Enjoy our luaus, our lagoons and our ladies... and remember, what happens in Tahiti, stays in Tahiti."
Homer,"Ba-bye. Bye, bye. Thanks for staying with us... we appreciate your putting cloth over our women's boobies... you'll receive an updated bill after you leave... Bye, bye."
Homer,More sugar! More sugar!
Homer,Why not?
Homer,I'm in charge of the tackle box!
Homer,Goodbye!
Homer,I heard you and mommy yelling again last night.
Homer,We got a fish! We got a fish!
Homer,"After we eat it, can we let it go? Can we catch a submarine?"
Homer,"You okay, Daddy?"
Homer,Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!
Homer,Are you God?
Homer,I need a ride to Cub Scouts.
Homer,"No, I swear!"
Homer,And we're off!
Homer,Now remember -- steer into the sculptures.
Homer,Those squeaks sound like couch springs. Groovin' to the beat of love!
Homer,"Hey, what's going on here?!"
Homer,Another me? You can watch the kids.
Homer,"Hey, what's going on here?!"
Homer,"Hey, what's going on here?!"
Homer,I cleaned out the garage and lost fifty pounds!
Homer,Why you little!
Homer,"Okay, hold still. This is the last picture on the roll."
Homer,"You watch your mouth, you little smartass."
Homer,Nothin's gonna ruin this one.
Homer,Here we go... here we go... here we go...
Homer,"What are you, cavemen? Turn on the lights!"
Homer,Hey! A little respect!
Homer,"Well, I traded it to a kid for a bite of his sandwich."
Homer,Quit makin' cracks.
Homer,I'll crack you!
Homer,What kind of afterlife is this? Can't even strangle my dead kid.
Homer,Not again.
Homer,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Homer,It was that golden weekend between Summer school and regular school...
Homer,Young me? What brings you to the present?
Homer,"Well, if we put our heads together, we can think of a plan."
Homer,No.
Homer,I'm here to take my life back!
Homer,Not so fast! Say hello to The United Federation of Homers Through History!
Homer,"Okay guys, let's regroup. We'll come back with more Homers and start fresh in the morning."
Homer,That's Renaissance Homer.
Homer,"Now, for my first act as President..."
Homer,I just wanted the woman I married.
Homer,I never realized you had so much work done.
Homer,Now I'm gonna have to look at that every morning.
Homer,"Marge number two, how would you win my whoopee?"
Homer,"You're right Marge, I could never leave you. Not even for you. If there was a dot or a squiggle different, that would be too much."
Homer,I'll kill you the way I killed intellectual Homer!
Homer,Bart! Can the chatter and fetch me a baloney sandwich!
Homer,"Shut up, you kids, and bring me baloney!"
Homer,"Forget it, Doc! What if that's my marriage in there?"
Homer,"See what your monkeyshines have done, boy?!"
Homer,Why you little... I'll teach you to make fun of my socks...
Homer,"Ouch! Oooch! Eeech! Ouch! Ooch! Oh, stop it!!"
Homer,Fourteen... Fifteen... Sixteen! Woo-hoo!
Homer,"Oh, I don't feel so good."
Homer,"Eh, I think that's all of 'em."
Homer,"Psst, Barney! My Dad's asleep. Want a beer?"
Homer,"I've got two words for you. Mellow out, man. Hmm? Hmm?"
Homer,"Wish me luck, Dad."
Homer,"Stay with me, Marge, and I promise we'll travel the world... and perhaps outer space."
Homer,"Hey, Professor Von Hubba-hubba! Wanna hop in my dune bug and erode some beach?"
Homer,"Come on, baby. The only math you need is you plus me equals forever."
Homer,"Half-day, eh?"
Homer,My fellow Wildcats... My name is Homer Simpson. There are many reasons why I... uh... I... I... You know what?
Homer,"I spent all night working on that speech, but now I realize the best thing to do is speak from my heart."
Homer,So... uh... I feel that... fellow Wildcats...
Homer,"Um... ""Webster's defines""... um... ""in the words of Ted Nugent""... ""school spirit""... ""next card""... ""the future""..."
Homer,No fair!
Homer,"""Color My World,"" ""Disco Sucks"" and Butthead the Goat."
Homer,They're too big to fail.
Homer,"Uh, uh, no, I'm, uh... just exploring my body!"
Homer,"Oh, hair. I'll love you when you're old and gray."
Homer,"Huh... well, two can play at that game!"
Homer,Who are you?
Homer,Why you little...
Homer,"It was love at first sight, and you ruined it!"
Homer,What do you know?
Homer,You're lookin' at him.
Homer,You're the idiot.
Homer,Don't act like I'm the first person that ever said that!
Homer,Shut up and go to the prom with me!
Homer,C'mere!
Homer,"Stupid kid. Steals my future. Well I'm going to...ice cream, with cookie dough?!"
Homer,...unnecessarily big TVs?!
Homer,"...""Thursday Night Football?!"" And the globe feels so warm -- I am in awe of the future!"
Homer,"Okay, that's not so great."
Homer,I've met some jive turkeys in the seventies but that turkey's the jivest.
Homer,I've traveled through space and time to make Marge settle for me because she doesn't know better.
Homer,"I've gotta ask, what happened? Was I in a forest fire or something?"
Homer,"For an evening or a week, there's no place like the mall. Food, fun and fashion -- the mall has it all!"
Homer,"Oh pilot, let's swing by... oh, Heidelberg and drop in on Oktoberfest."
Homer,Wheeee -- I'm sort of rich! I can rent anything I want!
Homer,"Oh Marge, if only I knew what these paintings meant."
Homer,"I know the woman I loved is still in there somewhere, behind all this nonsense."
Homer,Why does she get to eat before the reception?
Homer,I put you in a rabbit cage! I poked your flab back in! Square by square!
Homer,"Mmm, that's good. More, more! Refill! Free!"
Homer,Daddy! Daddy!
Homer,Let's all go out for some frosty chocolate milkshakes.
Homer,Go Vikings!
Homer,This Viking stuff is too dangerous. I'm going to become a gentleman art thief.
Homer,Huh? Hm? What the--
Homer,Spooky. Hm... hm...
Homer,It's great! I haven't been this skinny since high school.
Homer,Fine!
Homer,"Hmmm... hey, something's blocking it."
Homer,You taping it?
Homer,I'll watch it later.
Homer,"Marge, please, I'm busy."
Homer,Zookeeper! Zookeeper! Those two monkeys are killing each other!
Homer,Oh.
Homer,"Wow! Look at me, er uh, Mom! I am, 'er uh, President Kennedy!"
Homer,Take out wrenched ankle.
Homer,Mom! Mom! Mom!
Homer,"Sing me my bedtime song, mom."
Homer,Darn tootin'
Homer,... big Fig Newton!
Homer,But I want to play in the mud and be a hippie.
Homer,How could you let me turn into you.
Homer,"B-b-b-b-but the poncho. Hit the road, square."
Homer,BOM BOM BOM BOM
Homer,BOM BOM BOM BOM
Homer,"Hey thanks, Moe."
Homer,Friends forever?
Homer,Geronimooo -- oh my God!
Homer,"Hey, what happened to all the water?"
Homer,What the heck is that thing?
Homer,"Marge, come here."
Homer,"Marge, I need both hands for this game. Can you feed me nachos while I play?"
Homer,Tell that to the brave crew of the S.S. Triangle.
Homer,Come on! You're always saying we should do things as a couple.
Homer,"Oh, this is wonderful. I love you, Atari."
Homer,"Well, I aims to please. Hey, let's stop by that dumpster and make out. Hold that thought."
Homer,"With you, baby, Top Ramen tastes like Cup O' Noodles."
Homer,You know these IKEA foam futons do Velcro together.
Homer,I understand. We should follow the lead of today's celebrity role models.
Homer,"Okay everyone, let's warm up our harmonies. HOMER..."
Homer,You applied to college? Why didn't you tell me?
Homer,"I thought you were telling me you wanted to apply yourself to making a collage. And as I recall, I was against it."
Homer,"Oh baby, you deserve every last bit of it! I can get the money. But it'll mean swallowing my pride and working for my Dad..."
Homer,None of your business. Now give me a job at your business.
Homer,"Okay, all right! Time's up!"
Homer,This book sucks so much.
Homer,Even Walt Disney?
Homer,Really? I thought it was written by losers.
Homer,"Professor August, eh? Who is he, some grey-haired old bookworm?"
Homer,I've never heard that noise before. Are you sick?
Homer,Hm... I wonder what's on your mind...
Homer,"Oh Elaine, will you ever find someone who's sponge-worthy?"
Homer,"Here's what I say to that: no soup for you! Because I am ""master of my domain."" Newman."
Homer,"Hey, I worked hard all day to pay for your education. Can't I get all Zima-ed up and have my best girl put salve on my laser burns?"
Homer,"Apparently if all the kids fire at your stomach at once, it adds up."
Homer,Are you by that Joan Miro statue?
Homer,"Hey, it's townies like me that cook your food and clean your bathrooms!"
Homer,What the hell is going on here? Chanting?!
Homer,"Marge, what are you doing in this crazy college? This place is nothing like ""Animal House""! I smashed a beatnik's guitar and he sued me for damages! Successfully!"
Homer,Slam!
Homer,"I can't do it! Our harmony-laden R&B doesn't make sense in this cruel world. I'm taking our music to the next level: Guitar Rock Utilizing Nihilist Grunge Energies. Or, as I call it: GRUNGE."
Homer,"We are Sadgasm, and this song is called... ""Politically Incorrect."""
Homer,PAIN IS BROWN / HATE IS WHITE / LOVE IS BLACK / STAB THE NIGHT /
Homer,KINGDOM OF NUMB / CLOSET OF HURT / FEELINGS ARE DUMB / KISSES ARE DIRT...
Homer,Marge!
Homer,Hey Marge.
Homer,Now why would I be angry and bitter? Because I'm paying for you to make goo-goo eyes at some smooth-talking professor?
Homer,"Well if you feel that way, maybe you can find someone who wants to nurture the new you, maybe someone a little older and more sophisticated, who can take you to Europe during the summer."
Homer,Yeah.
Homer,"Okay, I'll keep the L.P.s and you take the C.D.s. I'll take the typewriter, you take the computer. I'll take the Enron stock, you take the Microsoft stock. And um..."
Homer,I just want a tentacle.
Homer,"Gimme a beer, Moe."
Homer,Fine. Cohiba me.
Homer,Leave the humidor.
Homer,Seeing Marge always reminds me of Marge.
Homer,"RAZORBLADE OF APATHY / SHAVE ME WITH YOUR IRONY / SHAVE ME, SHAVE ME..."
Homer,"Why aren't I happy? I'm the hottest grunge artist on Mucous Records, Weird Al is doing a parody of my song..."
Homer,He who is tired of Weird Al is tired of life.
Homer,SPREAD YELLOW GUNK / ON MY PANCAKE HEART / COUNTRY-CHURNED GIRL / IN MY GROCERY CART
Homer,I PAID FOR HER DREAMS / SHE TAUGHT ME TO CRY / LIKE WATERY KNIVES / LIKE RAIN FROM MY EYES / I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT MINE / I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT MINE...
Homer,MARGE-A-RINE / MARGE-A-RINE / MARGE-A-RINE / MARGE-A-RINE / MARGE-A-RINE...
Homer,I need it...
Homer,But I need it...
Homer,Of course. The thing that stood between us -- the nineties -- is almost over.
Homer,"At least we know there'll never be a president worse than Bill Clinton. Imagine, lying in a deposition in a civil lawsuit. That's the worst sin a president could commit."
Homer,Never.
Homer,Why you little!...
Homer,"Creepy. You can have mine, Bongo."
Homer,LITTLE HOMER HAD A DOG / AND BONGO WAS HIS NAME-O / B-O-ON-ON-GO / B-O-ON-ON-GO...
Homer,A hole next to the seat to hold my cup?
Homer,"Where are we going, Daddy?"
Homer,Miss Viola? Isn't she cuckoo?
Homer,Okay. How long till we come back and get him?
Homer,What?! No! No! No! Bongo!!
Homer,Where's Bongo? Is he still at the crazy lady's...
Homer,"Ketchup, please."
Homer,I'm-not-hungry-anymore.
Lisa,"Mr. Szyslak, you want to buy some band candy?"
Lisa,"If you have to guess, guess ""B."""
Lisa,Not every question!
Lisa,Stop telling me that.
Lisa,"Yeah, even though McDonald's owns Yale now, it's still a great school. And I could never afford to go there if I hadn't won the Montgomery Burns Scholarship."
Lisa,Yeah. I miss Christmas.
Lisa,Is that robot break-dancing?
Lisa,Tell me about it. I broke up with Milhouse.
Lisa,Uh...
Lisa,"Look, if you want Jenda to take you back you should show some initiative. Get a job."
Lisa,Armpit noises are not a language.
Lisa,"Look, my point is, show Jenda you want to be successful and she might take you back. It's never too late for love."
Lisa,"It's so great that Yale has finally forbidden men from taking science. Now let's see, should I major in Femistry or Galgebra?"
Lisa,What? I don't want to go to the same college as you.
Lisa,"Yeah, I'm starting to see that."
Lisa,Really?
Lisa,"Um, have you eaten onions lately?"
Lisa,Well... okay. I guess this is my destiny.
Lisa,"Oh, that's so noble. But what about Jenda?"
Lisa,"So Nelson, who did you end up bringing tonight? Sherri or Terri?"
Lisa,Lisa... Lisa Simpson...
Lisa,Time for a smoke.
Lisa,Losers? You mean losers like...
Lisa,"Simone de Beauvoir, Margaret Mead, Queen Elizabeth the First, Lauren Bacall..."
Lisa,Bart's making faces!
Lisa,Quick! Quick! Everyone into my dream!
Lisa,"Howdy pardners, My name is Sheriff..."
Lisa,I sure am hungry for my favorite food...
Lisa,Why it's my best friend...
Lisa,I'll get those no good Indians. Just as sure as my favorite book is...
Lisa,In I.Q. only!
Lisa,"Wait a minute, who killed Maggie?"
Lisa,"I just had a worrisome thought! If there can be two incarnations of the Simpsons, why couldn't some evil marketing entity produce millions of others?"
Lisa,"Eh, forget it."
Lisa,Got any Joyce Carol Oates?
Lisa,We were just playing.
Lisa,Let's eat Maggie.
Lisa,"So how do you like being a walrus, Dad?"
Lisa,"Yeah, Bart."
Lisa,Might as well. You're getting this memory mixed up with a commercial you saw.
Lisa,"Dad, you just destroyed your first kiss."
Lisa,"Declarative memory can be broken into two subsets: the episodic forms are stored in the neocortex, while the semantic ones are--"
Lisa,"Oh, can that tuna! We can get your brain to work the same way you always get the TV to work -- by hitting it!"
Lisa,But I am just a simple librarian. I have only read about dancing in books.
Lisa,"Only one man was crazy enough to dance that dance, and he is dead!"
Lisa,But how?
Lisa,Poor predictable Bart. Always takes rock.
Lisa,Hey...
Lisa,Oh my God! My brother's my best friend.
Lisa,That'll learn `im to bust my tomater.
Lisa,"They're only using you for your pool, you know."
Lisa,"Well, well, well. Look who's come crawlin' back."
Lisa,"Uh-oh. Should I laugh? Was that dry British wit? Or subtle self-pity? Ooh, they're staring at me, better respond."
Lisa,Scanning for sarcasm... it's clean. Go!
Lisa,"I'm dizzy! I'm nauseous! Oh, but I'm popular!"
Lisa,"He's not like anybody I've ever met. He's like a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a vest. He sure is ugly, though. So why can't I stop staring at him?"
Lisa,"Oh, no... I think I'm getting a crush on Nelson Muntz!"
Lisa,My first kiss! I always wondered what it would be like!
Lisa,"Oh, I know. I heard it too. Here's some music."
Lisa,"This is kind of relaxing. But it's so hard to turn off my brain. I have to stop thinking... starting now. Hey, it worked. Oh no, that's thinking!"
Lisa,"Ohh, it's a ball of yarn. That's funny, I feel like batting it around."
Lisa,I have a paw!
Lisa,"Oh my gosh, I've entered the body of our cat!"
Lisa,"Beh! Mag-gie! Hey, hey, get your sticky hands off me. Owww!"
Lisa,"Oh, yuck! That sandwich is full of meat. There's bacon, Canadian bacon, Mexican bacon..."
Lisa,...and a mouth-watering veal chop.
Lisa,"Oh, no. Now I'm Dad."
Lisa,"And I'm at a stupid, boring ballet."
Lisa,Whuh?
Lisa,"I'm sorry, honey."
Lisa,"Geez, why is Lisa so mad at me? I only came to this dump so I could be with her. And, what happened to my big sandwich?"
Lisa,These girls are brilliant! I finally found kids I can relate to.
Lisa,"Wow, I'm actually passing as a college student! And they don't have a Blue's Clue. Whoops, gotta age it up."
Lisa,I'm in a coffee house listening to poetry! There's a cat on a table and no one seems to care! This is the single greatest day of my life.
Lisa,"Oh my God, my social studies project is due tomorrow morning!"
Lisa,"Oh my God, I was wrong! And by being corrected, I learned! And no one cared about my feelings!"
Lisa,"Okay, I can talk my way out of this."
Lisa,A fight? That would mean rejecting the last part of me that's still a girl.
Lisa,"Okay, I'll do it. But whom should I beat up?"
Lisa,"They're looking at me! All right, Lisa -- time to show these jazz legends how we swing in the suburbs."
Lisa,Why did I have to lie about my heritage? By speaking with forked tongue I am in heap big trouble. And now I'm thinking in stereotypes? That's even worse!
Lisa,Question two: Using what you learned in question one...
Lisa,"You can do it, Lisa. There's nothing in the room but you and the test."
Lisa,Focus!
Lisa,Maybe I should just move on to question two.
Lisa,"Oh my God, you've been challenged! Well Lisa, let's see how you respond."
Lisa,Here it comes.
Lisa,But then... you wound up like you.
Lisa,Those girls are snotty and shallow. Tell them off!
Lisa,You'd better hope they say yes!
Lisa,Is it possible I've met a teacher who doesn't like me?!
Lisa,"Aw, he's sweet. What am I doing? He's just Ralph with a dream. The dream of not Ralphing. But I'm sure I could totally change and fix him."
Lisa,"Wow, I made Mom cry. What unimaginable power! I can use this to get anything I want. But right now, all I want is for Mom to stop crying."
Lisa,"Mom, Chloe just won the Peabody Award!"
Lisa,"I'll tell you what's wrong: you getting a C on this project and winding up at a third-rate college. Lisa, the world needs you to go to Wellesley!"
Lisa,That's assault! That is assault.
Lisa,"Diphthongs, cognates, Latin roots / Lisa clobbers all you fruits!"
Lisa,Ah.
Lisa,The rice wine has penetrated to the essence of your souls.
Lisa,You're the tail!
Lisa,"Dad, Bart's feet are on my half of the shell!"
Lisa,Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
Lisa,That life is worth living.
Lisa,Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom!
Lisa,Do you know where I could find him?
Lisa,"The train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound."
Lisa,"I see he touched you, too."
Lisa,"Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!"
Lisa,"Hey, Lisa, indeed."
Lisa,"Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?"
Lisa,You can't go! You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
Lisa,"Oh, please."
Lisa,But I need you too.
Lisa,"I, I understand. Mr. Bergstrom, I'm going to miss you."
Lisa,"Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom."
Lisa,"So, I guess this is it? It you don't mind I'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?"
Lisa,Nothing.
Lisa,Mr. Bergstrom left today.
Lisa,He's gone. Forever.
Lisa,I didn't think you'd understand.
Lisa,"I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!"
Lisa,"Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!"
Lisa,Baboon!
Lisa,No!
Lisa,"Look, if you just want me to forgive you --"
Lisa,Yeah.
Lisa,You're so silly.
Lisa,I don't have any banana.
Lisa,"I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad."
Lisa,"But Mom, I want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults."
Lisa,That music always sends a chill down my spine.
Lisa,Mom! You wouldn't dare.
Lisa,"Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?"
Lisa,Half a gallon of chocolate.
Lisa,Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
Lisa,"Half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip."
Lisa,"Grampa, what a question?"
Lisa,Sprinkles and syrup.
Lisa,It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.
Lisa,Yes. Ten please.
Lisa,Isn't it obvious? We've degraded ourselves and set back the children's rights movement for decades to come.
Lisa,"It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth."
Lisa,You grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
Lisa,How's your marriage?
Lisa,"Way to go, Grampa."
Lisa,"Hurry, Mom! If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone."
Lisa,"I think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and I hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity."
Lisa,"Hey, they do look alike!"
Lisa,"Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life."
Lisa,He's no wittier than the next superhero.
Lisa,I stand corrected.
Lisa,Too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
Lisa,"Yeah, Mom! Guess what? For a dollar a man sold me thirty-five Caspers and a dozen Lois Lanes."
Lisa,"She means you should get a job, stupid."
Lisa,"How's it going, Bart?"
Lisa,Maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. Lets see...
Lisa,"Ah ha, now you look pathetic."
Lisa,"Maggie, look. What's that?"
Lisa,Lee-mur. Lee-mur.
Lisa,Zee-boo. Zee-boo.
Lisa,I'm trying to teach Maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. I want her to have all the advantages that I didn't have.
Lisa,"It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap."
Lisa,"You know his blood type, how romantic."
Lisa,"Oh, yeah? What's my shoe size?"
Lisa,Ring.
Lisa,"Yes, Dad."
Lisa,"Ooh, look, Maggie, what is that? Do-dec-ah-edron. Dodecahedron."
Lisa,"That's okay, Bart. Nobody really believed it. We were just trying to scare you."
Lisa,"Wait, Dad, he's smiling."
Lisa,"It's to open the crate, stupid."
Lisa,"No, Maggie. Not Az-tec. Ol-mec. Ol-mec."
Lisa,Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
Lisa,"Bart... Bart... Hey, Bart."
Lisa,"No, no. He's fine."
Lisa,"Bart, my birthday is in two days. I'm gonna be eight years old. It's a big number -- almost double digits."
Lisa,"Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?"
Lisa,"Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I've made things for you. But you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all..."
Lisa,"Oh, thank you."
Lisa,"Well, all right -- if you listen to the poem I just wrote."
Lisa,"Meditations on turning eight, by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, --"
Lisa,"Bart, in the split second before he died, I bet Scratchy appreciated his birthday present. You see how this relates to us?"
Lisa,"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OVERLOOKED MIDDLE CHILD -- HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME."
Lisa,"Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before I join them I have one question: Today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and I'm afraid to ask."
Lisa,"I thought so. Oh, Bart, you..."
Lisa,"Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show."
Lisa,"Although I am aware you are looking at me, I would look exactly the same even if you weren't."
Lisa,"Huh... wha-- Bart, it's six a.m."
Lisa,"Oh! This is the best present I ever got. Thank you, Bart. Thank you Michael."
Lisa,"Bye, bye, Leon / Bye, roomie / Bye, Pardner / You're a credit to Dementia!"
Lisa,I don't think real checks have exclamation points.
Lisa,Daaad!
Lisa,"Where did you get the idea for this, Mom?"
Lisa,"Wait, Dad!"
Lisa,"Hm. An essay contest. ""Children under twelve""... ""Three hundred words""... ""Fiercely pro-American."" Sounds interesting."
Lisa,"What would Ben Franklin say if he were alive today? He'd say... oh, think of a better opening."
Lisa,Not very well.
Lisa,Yes!
Lisa,"Yes, Mom."
Lisa,"Okay, America. Inspire me."
Lisa,"Wow, a bald eagle."
Lisa,Hmm...
Lisa,"Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad."
Lisa,"When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. And as they were nourished by Mother Earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow out of something so fragile... so pure. Thank you."
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,Bart! There's no such thing as first bedsies. You just made that up.
Lisa,Iiiiiii Waaaaaannt... That one.
Lisa,Why? What's wrong with it?
Lisa,"No, really, what?"
Lisa,What did you do to it?
Lisa,MOMMM!
Lisa,Have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior ability?
Lisa,"Ah, me too!"
Lisa,Barbara Bush.
Lisa,"Hello, sir."
Lisa,Only two. I checked.
Lisa,Mom?
Lisa,I'm too excited to sleep. Anyone up for the Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial?
Lisa,An early crusader for women's rights. She led the Floormop Rebellion of 1910. Later she appeared on the highly unpopular 75 cent piece.
Lisa,"Okay, but you don't know what you're missing."
Lisa,"""I will iron your sheets when you iron out the inequities in your labor laws."" Amen, sister."
Lisa,How could I read my essay now? I don't believe my own words.
Lisa,Honest Abe. He'll show me the way.
Lisa,"Mr. Lincoln, I..."
Lisa,"Mr. Lincoln, my name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem."
Lisa,"Mr. Jefferson, my name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem."
Lisa,"Sorry, sir. It's just that..."
Lisa,"Uh, maybe I should be going. I caught you at a bad time."
Lisa,The truth must be told.
Lisa,"I would like to read a different essay, if I may."
Lisa,"""The city of Washington was built on a stagnant swamp some 200 years ago, and very little has changed. It stank then, and it stinks now. Only today, it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air."""
Lisa,"""And who did I see taking a bribe, but the ""Honorable"" Bob Arnold. But don't worry, Congressman, I'm sure you can buy all the votes you need with your dirty money. And this will be one nation, under the dollar, with liberty and justice for none."""
Lisa,"I'm sorry, Dad. I couldn't think of a nice way to say America stinks."
Lisa,I can't believe it! The system works.
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon! Incredible Ned-ibles! Maude-acious vittles!.
Lisa,"Dad, do you know what Schadenfreude is?"
Lisa,"It's the German term for ""shameful joy"" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others."
Lisa,Sour grapes.
Lisa,"Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it! Hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! M-o-o-o-m!"
Lisa,You change it.
Lisa,"Okay, okay."
Lisa,But Bart --
Lisa,"I'm sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery."
Lisa,Hey!!
Lisa,You give that back. That belongs to me! That's mine!
Lisa,"Hey, stop that."
Lisa,Not any more. You punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. This is my brother... and he knows Karate.
Lisa,"Yeah, just keep laughing, it only makes him madder. Come on, Bart, start them off with the touch of death and go from there."
Lisa,It's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right.
Lisa,What are you so happy about?
Lisa,"No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart."
Lisa,I'm gonna eat EIGHT pieces of chocolate.
Lisa,I think this is something Bart would really have enjoyed. But it's the only way he'll learn.
Lisa,"Bart, is your boss a crook?"
Lisa,"Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King."
Lisa,"Bart, that's so sweet. May I see the card?"
Lisa,Hey there ten-year old. I couldn't afford to get you a new drum...
Lisa,...so how about a nice pair of bongos? Ewww.
Lisa,"Bart, you're not laughing. Too subtle?"
Lisa,A role model in my very own home. How convenient.
Lisa,Maybe you ate a clove.
Lisa,How Zen.
Lisa,Looking at you with quiet awe.
Lisa,"I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick."
Lisa,"Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk."
Lisa,"He's just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on ""How To Keep Cool In A Crisis."""
Lisa,Our dad... now he belongs to the ages.
Lisa,"No, Dad, Krusty is our guest. Your pratfalls and Punchinello antics aren't necessary here."
Lisa,Why don't we let our guest do it?
Lisa,"No, Dad, that's Hebrew. Krusty must be Jewish."
Lisa,"Dad, There are many prominent Jewish entertainers including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner, and Mel Brooks."
Lisa,"Poor Krusty, he's like a black velvet painting come to life."
Lisa,Come on...
Lisa,"Krusty, please continue."
Lisa,That is so sad.
Lisa,A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
Lisa,Let's move.
Lisa,"No, no. We're not converting, we just want to find a Rabbi Krustofsky."
Lisa,I didn't know that.
Lisa,"Oh yeah, it's all the kids talk about on Monday at school."
Lisa,I bet the rabbi misses Krusty.
Lisa,"Excuse us, Rabbi Krustofsky?"
Lisa,"Bart, we're gonna have to out smart him."
Lisa,"Bart, we've been going about this all wrong. What's the one thing rabbis prize above everything else?"
Lisa,No Bart. Knowledge.
Lisa,We're gonna hit him where it hurts. Right in the Judaica.
Lisa,This looks good Bart. Take it to him.
Lisa,Not quite. I got some dynamite stuff from Rabbi Simon ben Eleazar.
Lisa,"Here you go, Bart. It's a long shot, but, that's all I can do without learning ancient Hebrew."
Lisa,Bart! I am not gonna learn ancient Hebrew.
Lisa,"There, there, Rabbi. It's not too late."
Lisa,I didn't select this costume for mobility. I wore it to salute the noble native American of the Pacific Northwests...
Lisa,YAHHH!
Lisa,"Oh yeah, three bad nightmares."
Lisa,"Dad, that's Monaco."
Lisa,"No, Bart. Peace on Earth."
Lisa,Peace on Earth.
Lisa,Peace on Earth.
Lisa,Peace on Earth.
Lisa,Peace on Earth.
Lisa,"Oh, no! Maggie made a wish!"
Lisa,Yaaayyy!!
Lisa,I wish for world peace.
Lisa,I had a bad dream. Could I sleep in your bed?
Lisa,Bart... Bart...
Lisa,I'll give you a candy necklace.
Lisa,"Thanks, Bart."
Lisa,Morning.
Lisa,Mom! Dad!
Lisa,Can we sleep with you?
Lisa,"Hey, here's a good job, Dad. Oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor."
Lisa,"Mom, what's wrong?"
Lisa,"Whayda ya know, she's right."
Lisa,"Don't forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner."
Lisa,"Dad, I'm calling about the school talent show."
Lisa,"No. Dad, I broke my last saxophone reed, and I need you to get me a new one."
Lisa,"I called her. She's not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement."
Lisa,"Mom, where is he? If I don't get that reed I'll sound terrible."
Lisa,It's not my fault. It's the reed.
Lisa,I'm done.
Lisa,"I'm sorry dad, I don't feel much like eating."
Lisa,I forgive you.
Lisa,No. I didn't.
Lisa,"I love you, Dad!"
Lisa,Snowball II... Santa's Little Helper... this is Princess. Please don't exclude her because she's different.
Lisa,"Dad, no!"
Lisa,"Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable."
Lisa,"Father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived."
Lisa,"Wait, Dad, I've got something for you."
Lisa,You're so beautiful.
Lisa,"Oh look. You haven't touched your salt lick. Num num, good salt lick."
Lisa,"This next song is also about a girl and her pony. It's called ""Wildfire."""
Lisa,"I just called to say I love you, Dad."
Lisa,What's wrong with Dad?
Lisa,No.
Lisa,You're gonna make me give up Princess?
Lisa,All the years I've lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face.
Lisa,"She likes a little carrot after her oats. And she really likes it when you scratch her behind the ear. And if you're playing the radio, she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night. Please take good care of my Princess."
Lisa,I'll never forget you.
Lisa,"Dad, you don't have to do this."
Lisa,"Dad, I understand the sacrifice you've made for me. That's why I gave up the pony."
Lisa,Hmmm hmmm. There's a big dumb animal I love even more than that horse.
Lisa,"I mean you, you dummy."
Lisa,"Giddyup, Dad."
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,Everything.
Lisa,Uh... take us to the video store.
Lisa,"But, Dad, I can't find ""Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town""."
Lisa,"Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert's office?"
Lisa,"Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there."
Lisa,You should smell his room.
Lisa,That looks like an Olympic torch to me. Your husband could be an Olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career.
Lisa,The wax never lies.
Lisa,You're telling who?
Lisa,"Come here, Maggie."
Lisa,"Mom, instead of milk for dinner, can I have a ""Virgin Moe?"""
Lisa,"When Bart's done, can we moe to the moevies? There's a moetinee."
Lisa,"Well, it's a country in Europe --"
Lisa,One of the economic powers of the world--
Lisa,"No. Because they're efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic."
Lisa,I made a new bar of soap by squeezing all our little soap slivers together.
Lisa,"My jump rope broke, but I just tied it back together."
Lisa,Is anything wrong?
Lisa,What?
Lisa,"Is Mom gonna have another baby, Dad?"
Lisa,Did you hear that Maggie? Another baby in the house.
Lisa,Doesn't Mom do that stuff?
Lisa,"It's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, Dad. We watch an appalling amount of TV."
Lisa,"Dad, if the new baby is a girl, can we name her Ariel?"
Lisa,Ariel.
Lisa,Ariel.
Lisa,Ariel.
Lisa,That is so sad.
Lisa,"Dad, can I have some money to buy Bart a birthday present?"
Lisa,"Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars."
Lisa,"Quit it, Dad!"
Lisa,"I dreamed I was married to Corey, and we lived on a pony farm...and Corey was always walking around with his shirt off."
Lisa,Is it Sherri?
Lisa,"How do you mean, dad?"
Lisa,How does that make him a hero?
Lisa,Awww.
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,"Bart Simpson! The thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. When they find out you've been fooling them, they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors."
Lisa,The police will catch you sooner or later.
Lisa,"Maybe not, but I bet you're stupid enough to have left a ""Property of Bart Simpson"" label on that radio."
Lisa,"Hey, stop that!"
Lisa,What's going on?
Lisa,"I don't know, the Dolphins."
Lisa,"Look, Dad. I made a modest studio apartment for my Malibu Stacey doll. This is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter..."
Lisa,DAAAAAD! You're not listening to me.
Lisa,Why isn't Dad ever interested in anything I do?
Lisa,"No.... well, we used to have burping contests, but I outgrew it."
Lisa,I think so.
Lisa,Wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
Lisa,He said Denver just fumbled.
Lisa,"All right, Dolphins!"
Lisa,Whoo-hoo!
Lisa,Fifty big ones?
Lisa,You mean you made a bet?
Lisa,What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
Lisa,Uh-huh.
Lisa,So gambling makes a good thing even better.
Lisa,"...three, two, one..."
Lisa,"Boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars."
Lisa,"Really, where?"
Lisa,"Okay, dad."
Lisa,"Goodnight, Dad. I had a really nice time today."
Lisa,Can I watch football with you again next Sunday?
Lisa,"Point well taken. Uh, mom, could you loosen my blanket a little? Dad tucked me in too tight and it's cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs."
Lisa,He'll lose.
Lisa,"Look at the fear in his eyes. Listen to the quiver in his voice. He's a little boy, lost in a game of men."
Lisa,I'd bet my entire college fund on it.
Lisa,"Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I'm getting nauseous."
Lisa,"Well, I like the 49ers because they're pure of heart -- Seattle because they got something to prove -- and the Raiders because they always cheat."
Lisa,"Hey, the new sign is really working."
Lisa,Let's see... football... Football: homo-eroticism in... oddball Canadian rules... Phyllis George and...
Lisa,"Yeah, me!"
Lisa,"C'mon, dad. It doesn't take a genius to realize that Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game."
Lisa,"You know, dad, Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week."
Lisa,"Mom, can't a man do something nice for his loved ones?"
Lisa,The Broken Neck Blues.
Lisa,"Dad, I'm making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. And with your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago."
Lisa,"Moe, this is L.S. calling for H.S."
Lisa,"The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago. I was sitting on my daddy's knee when the Saints, who were four and a half point favorites, but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second, to cover the spread."
Lisa,"Oh dad, you must've bought me every Malibu Stacey accessory there is."
Lisa,"You know, dad, we've been watching a lot of TV lately. Maybe, the Sunday after the Super Bowl, we could hike up to the top of Mount Springfield. The fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets."
Lisa,What about Daddy-Daughter day?
Lisa,So that's it. You just wanted me to help you gamble. You never wanted to be with me at all.
Lisa,My third husband bought me this.
Lisa,Give me some chips for it.
Lisa,"Don't tell me what to do, Sonny. I've been gambling since I was eight. And I've been hockin' jewelry since I was twelve. Now give me some chips!"
Lisa,"Look around you, Malibu Stacey. All this was bought with dirty money. Your penthouse, your Alfa Romeo, your collagen injection clinic."
Lisa,"You're going back into the shoe-box. It may not be pretty, but dammit, it's honest."
Lisa,"I, Lisa Simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacey accessories!"
Lisa,"So you've come to buy my forgiveness. Sorry, Homer."
Lisa,"Yeah, I did."
Lisa,"Well, I would like to see what all the fuss is about."
Lisa,Put me down.
Lisa,"Look dad, I'll tell you who's gonna win the Super Bowl if you want me to. But it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me."
Lisa,I think Dallas is a mortal lock.
Lisa,However...
Lisa,"However, I may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously I want you to lose. In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo."
Lisa,I don't know.
Lisa,"If I still love you, Dallas. If I don't, Buffalo."
Lisa,"Bart, who's winning?"
Lisa,I suspected as much.
Lisa,"Come on, Dad!"
Lisa,Isn't it though?
Lisa,"Don't even bother with the raisins. I'm not gonna eat 'em... Double bologna! Double bologna!... I don't ask for much, just no pimento. Don't forget to make it double bologna 'cause I can hardly..."
Lisa,Thanks mom.
Lisa,No way.
Lisa,"Mom, Bart's making faces at me."
Lisa,"Mom, he's doing it again. Bart, quit it! Quit it! Hey quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Mommmmm!!"
Lisa,Bart's making faces.
Lisa,Wish I'd thought of that.
Lisa,That's alright. I think I'll just hit the hay.
Lisa,I'm aware of the time.
Lisa,"You think you know fear? Well, I've seen them naked."
Lisa,Bart you really shouldn't be looking through other people's things. Find anything good?
Lisa,"Ah, Bart! That's a black-head gun!"
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,Uh-um.
Lisa,She's beautiful!
Lisa,"Wow, thanks Sparkle. Wait, this isn't you."
Lisa,Is it that girl with the lazy eye patch?
Lisa,Mmm! Could it be there's a special someone you're not telling me about?
Lisa,Yeah?
Lisa,Is it Terri?
Lisa,Is it that exchange student Mx!pa?
Lisa,"Sure it is. Hey Bart, let's do some homework."
Lisa,How's the dog supposed to get in?
Lisa,"Dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse."
Lisa,"I knew it. All right, Bart, who's your girlfriend?"
Lisa,Maybe we should write her another letter. One that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
Lisa,"""Though I'll be inoculating babies in Kampuchea, my heart will always be with you."""
Lisa,"""Okay, okay... I cannot see you for the next five years, for I will be farming the ocean floor."""
Lisa,"""And any time I hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... Edna!"""
Lisa,"Wow, Dad."
Lisa,"No, I want to get him a beer."
Lisa,To the game.
Lisa,You stink Strawberry. We want Home-run Homer!
Lisa,"Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl."
Lisa,"Mom, they're professional athletes. They're used to this sort of thing. It rolls right off their backs."
Lisa,"No mom, it counts as a hit. Dad just won the game."
Lisa,All right! A test!
Lisa,"Janey, school is never a waste of time."
Lisa,Homemaker?!
Lisa,A homemaker! I might as well be dead!
Lisa,"Well, I'm gonna be a famous jazz musician. I've got it all figured out. I'll be unappreciated in my own country, but my gutsy blues stylings will electrify the French. I'll avoid the horrors of drug abuse, but I do plan to have several torrid love affairs. And I may or may not die young, I haven't decided."
Lisa,Can you tell me if I have what it takes to be a blues musician?
Lisa,But I'll practice every day!
Lisa,"You're wrong, you're wrong! You don't need long fingers to play the blues. The blues come from in here!"
Lisa,"My God, they are stubby."
Lisa,"Dear Log... This will be my last entry. For you were a journal of my hopes and dreams, and now I have none."
Lisa,What's so good about it....
Lisa,What's the point? They'll never notice.
Lisa,I quit.
Lisa,"If you think it's so great, why don't you join the band?"
Lisa,"Janey, I'm about ready to chuck the whole stinking alphabet."
Lisa,A doy.
Lisa,Nothin'.
Lisa,"Okay, but if you really want to honk Skinner off, I suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in."
Lisa,Shove it.
Lisa,Whattaya got?
Lisa,"Uh, I'll smoke it in class."
Lisa,"Come on, Bart. In your pre-Fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion."
Lisa,I don't know. You?
Lisa,"Well, you're earning your eighteen grand a year."
Lisa,Stupid Hoover... thinks she's so smart.
Lisa,She wouldn't be so smart without her Teacher's edition.
Lisa,That's right. It was I.
Lisa,I know. I know.
Lisa,"Bart, why'd you take the blame?"
Lisa,"Oh, Bart."
Lisa,Give it to the poor.
Lisa,It's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that.
Lisa,He is alive. He's wagging his tail.
Lisa,Checkers.
Lisa,"Thanks, Mom."
Lisa,"But, Mom, next week is volume four: Copernicus through Elephantiasis."
Lisa,Can't you see I'm reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station?
Lisa,"Close the gate, Maggie."
Lisa,Here Santa's Little Helper!
Lisa,Have you found a picture yet?
Lisa,Poor Santa's Little Helper. I'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
Lisa,You already petted him for ten minutes.
Lisa,"Look dad, there's a spot."
Lisa,"Uh, we're getting a lot of sparks over here, dad."
Lisa,"""Honey, I Hit A School Bus""!"
Lisa,Just tell me when the scary part's over.
Lisa,I guess that executive stress ball we got him for Christmas isn't working.
Lisa,She's wonderful. I could feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit.
Lisa,I'm sorry?
Lisa,These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV.
Lisa,Ewww.
Lisa,Sideshow Bob!
Lisa,"What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob. You're living proof that our revolving door prison system works."
Lisa,"Come on, Bart. If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too."
Lisa,I could've been the flower girl. And I wouldn't keep falling down either.
Lisa,"Yeah, well if they want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine."
Lisa,See for yourself.
Lisa,I'se just jammin' with you.
Lisa,We don't have seatbelts.
Lisa,"I think you have to be more aggressive, sir."
Lisa,Did the maniac kill her?
Lisa,How?
Lisa,I gotta help him.
Lisa,"Dad, what if I told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?"
Lisa,According to Eternity Magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. That's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
Lisa,"They'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. As you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less."
Lisa,Dad! Dad! Do you know what today is?
Lisa,No. It's two weeks since you got that subliminal weight loss tape. Let's get you on the scale.
Lisa,You've gained thirteen pounds.
Lisa,"Hey Bart, according to this magazine, in another million years, man will have an extra finger."
Lisa,Why didn't you go to dad?
Lisa,"Well, according to ""Eternity"" magazine, the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine. Dow chemical is developing a minty gel, which will eliminate excess guilt, but unfortunately it won't be on the market for another six months. So I guess you're gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to Milhouse."
Lisa,We leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
Lisa,This Award is the biggest farce I ever saw.
Lisa,I stand corrected.
Lisa,"Dad, you know you won."
Lisa,Dad? Dad?
Lisa,Unky Herb!
Lisa,"Why didn't you write, Unky Herb?"
Lisa,I see your point.
Lisa,"And while on Ventnor Avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. Of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill."
Lisa,Eleven hundred and fifty bones.
Lisa,"Well, I think we should invest in a set of the great books of Western Civilization. Look at this ad from ""New Republic for Kids."" Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: ""Paradise Regained,"" ""Martin Chuzzlewit,"" or Herman Melville's twin classics ""Omoo"" and ""Typee""."
Lisa,Maggie! Maggie!
Lisa,I think we owe a debt to Unky Herb. He took us into his home and Dad destroyed him.
Lisa,Peek-a-boo!
Lisa,"Finally, a copy of ""Ethan Frome"" to call my own."
Lisa,"No, Dad. You promised if Bart and I got C averages we could go to Kamp Krusty. And with no false modesty, you're looking at one happy camper."
Lisa,I've never gotten a B before.
Lisa,How could this have happened? I feel so dirty. Uh.. uh...uh. The dirt's not coming off. Okay. Calm down. This must just be a little typo.
Lisa,"Oh Miss Hoover, there appears to be a mistake on my report card. You gave me a B+ in conduct."
Lisa,Perhaps I'm not making myself clear. I think you should reconsider.
Lisa,"So, Bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of Kamp Krusty?"
Lisa,"A+! Oh, Bart, why didn't you at least forge plausible grades?"
Lisa,"Before I go to camp, I'll need boosters for malaria, German Measles, encephalitis, Hansen's disease..."
Lisa,"Don't patronize me, doctor."
Lisa,I'll write you every day.
Lisa,"If the pets die, don't replace them. I'll know!"
Lisa,This is a little more rustic than I expected.
Lisa,Are you sure that's safe?
Lisa,You're serving us gruel?
Lisa,"I feel like I'm gonna die, Bart."
Lisa,I meant soon.
Lisa,"Dear Mom and Dad, I no longer fear Hell, because I've been to Kamp Krusty."
Lisa,Our nature hikes have become grim death marches.
Lisa,"Our arts and crafts center is, in actuality, a Dickensian workhouse."
Lisa,Bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that Krusty the clown will come through.
Lisa,But I am far more pessimistic.
Lisa,I am not sure if this letter will reach you as our lines of communication have been cut.
Lisa,"And now the effort of writing has made me lightheaded. So I close by saying, save us! Save us now! Bart and Lisa."
Lisa,He's really having trouble keeping his balance.
Lisa,Kowalski!
Lisa,Wiggum!
Lisa,Crandall!
Lisa,"Bart, you said you were gonna name it ""Camp Freedom."""
Lisa,"Oh yeah? Who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom, ""President Clown""?"
Lisa,"It is the real Krusty. Look at that pacemaker scar, the cattle skull birthmark, and his famous superfluous nipple."
Lisa,Yuh huh.
Lisa,"Hey look, it's last year's winner, Deborah Jo Smallwood!"
Lisa,Sorry.
Lisa,Wow! My mother the actress. I feel like Lucie Arnaz-Luckinbill.
Lisa,"Hey, Mom, would it help if ah talked lahk this, too?"
Lisa,"Big Daddy, would y'all mind passin' a li'l ol' biscuit?"
Lisa,It's mom!
Lisa,I think it's supposed to symbolize her descent into madness.
Lisa,Mom!
Lisa,Everybody was cheering for you.
Lisa,"""Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy..."""
Lisa,Give it a little more gas.
Lisa,"No, no, that's too much."
Lisa,Know what I think would help?
Lisa,Nothing.
Lisa,"Dad, can I ask you a question?"
Lisa,Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
Lisa,Truly this was an act of God.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,Oh my God. I'm ugly.
Lisa,"Dad, do you think I'm ugly?"
Lisa,I'm an ugmo.
Lisa,Fathers have to say that stuff.
Lisa,"I'd like to be alone, please."
Lisa,I'm hideous.
Lisa,So you think I'm ugly?
Lisa,To shut myself off from the world and never be seen by human eyes again.
Lisa,What are you talking about?
Lisa,How could you? I won't do it!
Lisa,Nope.
Lisa,But that ride meant everything to him!
Lisa,I'll do it.
Lisa,She's beautiful.
Lisa,I thought those were illegal.
Lisa,There's no way I can beat this girl. She's the Jack Nicklaus of the pageant circuit.
Lisa,"I meant because they both win all the time, Mom."
Lisa,Are we done?
Lisa,Isn't this dangerous?
Lisa,It's hopeless.
Lisa,Do you really think I can win?
Lisa,But those other girls are prettier than me.
Lisa,Oh Bart.
Lisa,"My name is Lisa Simpson, and I want to be Little Miss Springfield so I can make our town a better place!"
Lisa,"Thanks, Dad."
Lisa,"Some people say that to love your country is old fashioned, uncool, real melvin... Well to them I say OH BEAUTIFUL, FOR SPACIOUS SKIES, FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN..."
Lisa,One! Two! Three! Four!
Lisa,LEFT A GOOD JOB IN THE CITY -- WORKIN' FOR THE MAN EVERY NIGHT AND DAY...
Lisa,"As Little Miss Springfield, it's my pleasure to welcome you to America, the Land of Opportunity."
Lisa,I'd say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod. Unless it's made out of plastic.
Lisa,Hi fellas.
Lisa,I'm going to be riding on a pack of cigarettes?
Lisa,I don't want to be a spokesperson for a cigarette company!
Lisa,Stop this float!
Lisa,I'm tired of being a corporate shill.
Lisa,From now I will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes.
Lisa,"Before I sing the National Anthem, I'd like to say that college football diverts funds badly needed for education and the arts."
Lisa,"Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?"
Lisa,"Possibly. But the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself. And I do."
Lisa,Uh-huh.
Lisa,It's a deal.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,You said he went bowling!
Lisa,"Bart, please. Don't you remember that Snowball I died four years ago tonight? Run over by the Mayor's beer swilling brother, Clovis."
Lisa,It's not working.
Lisa,Bart! You cast the wrong spell! Zombies!
Lisa,"Dad, we did something very bad."
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,Uh huh.
Lisa,Wait Bart! Maybe the library has another book that'll reverse the spell.
Lisa,"Hurry, Bart!"
Lisa,What's wrong?
Lisa,What are we going to have?
Lisa,What if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad?
Lisa,Ew!
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,"Bart, come quick! There's an Itchy and Scratchy MOVIE!!!"
Lisa,We got beets!
Lisa,"Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?"
Lisa,It wasn't that great.
Lisa,"It was the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life. And you wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos. Dustin Hoffman, Michael Jackson... of course they didn't use their real names, but you could tell it was them."
Lisa,Sorry Bart.
Lisa,"Dad, you've got to let Bart see that movie. I've never seen him like this. He has the demented melancholia of a Tennessee Williams heroine."
Lisa,Uh... I think it needs a little padding.
Lisa,Up-up-up. When I'm done.
Lisa,"Mom, they expect you to lie a little."
Lisa,"Well, you voted for him... twice!"
Lisa,I think it's wonderful. Mom and Dad side by side at the power plant. You'll be just like Marie and Pierre Curie.
Lisa,They discovered radium. Then they both died of radiation poisoning.
Lisa,I don't think we should be down here.
Lisa,Bart! The Winfields didn't have a son.
Lisa,"Bart, that's not funny."
Lisa,Aaah!
Lisa,"Dad, make Bart wash his hand."
Lisa,Daad!
Lisa,"Oh, I get it. Bart, the baby-sitter's here. Let me tuck you in."
Lisa,Homer.
Lisa,"Bart, are you taking a bath?"
Lisa,"This wouldn't have anything to do with Laura coming over, would it?"
Lisa,I don't care. Ask Hef over there.
Lisa,"Good luck in your trumped-up law suit, Dad."
Lisa,"Hey, wait... that's not a dummy!"
Lisa,"Dad, that's not the real Batman."
Lisa,"Dad, have you considered buying commercial time on channel ninety-two? Check it out."
Lisa,Look! There we are!
Lisa,Old Man Winter!
Lisa,Uh-huh.
Lisa,But I'm a real tightwad. Can I afford this remarkable system?
Lisa,I think you should do a new ad. One that's fresh and original.
Lisa,"Ooh / Meow / Dad, stop you're embarrassing us / Stop please."
Lisa,Promise you'll never do that again.
Lisa,"Dad, was that your commercial?"
Lisa,"Be-bop? ""Be-bop""?"
Lisa,"Well, don't push her. Remember, ""Tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."""
Lisa,"Tell it, Mom. Tell, it Mom."
Lisa,I wish we lived in the kitty house.
Lisa,Mommy.
Lisa,When are we going to get to my first word?
Lisa,My first word.
Lisa,Daaad!
Lisa,Mondale to Hart: Where's the Beef?
Lisa,Davah Hassahoff.
Lisa,Bart.
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,Bart. Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart.
Lisa,Homer.
Lisa,I don't see your name on it.
Lisa,"Ha, ha. Mom yelled at you."
Lisa,Did too.
Lisa,"Huh, okay."
Lisa,"Bart, that's gross!"
Lisa,Daaad!
Lisa,Operation? What are you talking about?
Lisa,We feel neither highs nor lows.
Lisa,Eh.
Lisa,"Dad, are you trying to tell us you're getting a coronary-artery bypass graft?"
Lisa,My dad is very sick. What's gonna happen if he dies?
Lisa,"Mom, this is fascinating. Did you know that they'll stop Dad's heart for six whole minutes?"
Lisa,"No, Mom, it's very reassuring. And I've learned a great deal from this cow's heart I got at the butcher shop."
Lisa,Oh dad.
Lisa,Hey! The incision in the coronary artery must be made below the blockage. Below!
Lisa,"All right, Dad!"
Lisa,"Oh, what a boon it could be for our under-funded public schools."
Lisa,Don't you mean three million dollars?
Lisa,Hardly. I'd like you to explain why we should build a mass transit system in a small town with a centralized population.
Lisa,Really?
Lisa,Mr. Lanley! Aren't you gonna ride the monorail?
Lisa,But the ride only takes a minute.
Lisa,Yayyy!
Lisa,We're under six!
Lisa,We understand.
Lisa,Five... six... seven... eight...
Lisa,... Nine... ten...
Lisa,"Goodbye, Great Aunt Gladys. I wish I had made more of an effort to get to know you these last few years."
Lisa,"Aunt Selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?"
Lisa,Goodbye Dad! Don't eat any solids.
Lisa,Yayyy!
Lisa,There it is!
Lisa,The Beeramid contains so much aluminum it would take five men to lift it. Twenty-two immigrant laborers died during its construction...
Lisa,Look! It's the Seven Duffs!
Lisa,"There's ""Surly""... and ""Remorseful""."
Lisa,This is a disgrace.
Lisa,I'm not sure that is water.
Lisa,"Bart, quit it, Bart. Quit it, quit it, quit it!"
Lisa,They're all around me. No way out. No way out I tell you!
Lisa,Aaaahhhh!!!
Lisa,"Ahhh, I can see the music."
Lisa,I am the Lizard Queen!
Lisa,Can't talk. Comin' down.
Lisa,"Dad, hide your shame!"
Lisa,I did.
Lisa,"Dad, can I..."
Lisa,"All right, Mom. I promise you will never be billed for another call. Bobby Sherman..."
Lisa,"Yes, Principal Skinner."
Lisa,Midnight?
Lisa,Uh - huh.
Lisa,Just like Oscar the Grouch.
Lisa,MUST YOU BE FOREVER DIALING THAT PHONE?!!!
Lisa,Excuse me.
Lisa,"Oh, c'mon! Hurry!"
Lisa,I made it!
Lisa,"Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph."
Lisa,Isn't that just pointless busywork?
Lisa,Poor Ralph.
Lisa,"Here you go, Ralph."
Lisa,Happy Valentine's.
Lisa,"Sure, I guess."
Lisa,Glad you liked it.
Lisa,Yeah. Nice gag.
Lisa,"Well, here's my house."
Lisa,Ralph thinks I like him. But I only gave him a valentine 'cause I felt sorry for him.
Lisa,What do you say to a boy to let him know you're not interested?
Lisa,I get the idea.
Lisa,"Thanks, Mom."
Lisa,"Ralph, I think you're nice but, I'm just not ready for this kind of thing. Do you understand?"
Lisa,Good.
Lisa,Forget it. To get those tickets our parents would have to be part of Springfield's cultural elite.
Lisa,"Oh no, it's Ralph! Just make some excuse."
Lisa,Now Ralph is in this play with me. I just know he's going to embarrass me in front of the whole school.
Lisa,"Oh, a Malibu Stacy Convertible! ""Look in the tunk."" He must mean trunk."
Lisa,"Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show! Oh, he must want me to go with him."
Lisa,I'm not sure I should go. I don't even like him.
Lisa,What if he wants to hold hands?
Lisa,What if he wants a kiss?
Lisa,What if he...
Lisa,"Dad, is it right to take things from people you don't like?"
Lisa,"Well, actually, it's not as bad as stealing, but my conscience is bothering me."
Lisa,"Hmm, I think you should give that a rest, Ralph. Chief Wiggum, how did you ever get these tickets?"
Lisa,That story isn't suitable for children.
Lisa,Eiw.
Lisa,"No, thanks."
Lisa,Aw.
Lisa,Oh no. Please don't show me with Ralph.
Lisa,Noooo!!
Lisa,"Now you listen to me -- I don't like you. I never liked you, and the only reason I gave you that stupid valentine is `cause nobody else would!"
Lisa,"Ralph, I'm sorry I..."
Lisa,Uh... Ralph?
Lisa,"Dear, dear George Washington. Can this liberty you dream of be worth all this bloodshed?"
Lisa,"Well, can it?"
Lisa,But couldn't we just give in to the British?
Lisa,"Oh, George..."
Lisa,"Please don't leave me, George."
Lisa,"Hi, Ralph. You were great tonight."
Lisa,I've got something for you.
Lisa,I thought you'd like it.
Lisa,First prize... first prize...
Lisa,First prize... first prize...
Lisa,Just screwing with your mind.
Lisa,I've grown a futuristic tomato by fertilizing it with Anabolic steroids.
Lisa,The very same. I think this tomato could wipe out world hunger.
Lisa,"Oh Bart, I forgot my math book. Would you hold this for me, please?"
Lisa,Bart!!!!!
Lisa,"Mom, Bart wrecked my project and the science fair's in three days!"
Lisa,"Oh... I was just thinking of a joke I saw on ""Herman's Head."""
Lisa,I want the most intelligent hamster you've got.
Lisa,How can a hamster write mysteries?
Lisa,"Oh, come on."
Lisa,"I propose to determine the answer to the question: ""Is my brother dumber than a hamster?"""
Lisa,Remarkable.
Lisa,Hamster one... Bart... zero.
Lisa,Experiment two: The food is connected to a mild electrical current.
Lisa,The hamster has learned a valuable lesson. Beware the hand of man.
Lisa,Hampster two... Bart zero...
Lisa,What have you done with my report?
Lisa,Got it.
Lisa,"Please, Mother. It's purely in the interest of science."
Lisa,But this project has no scientific merit.
Lisa,Oh no. I'll be socially unpopular. More so.
Lisa,This is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
Lisa,Do you think you can get the dental plan back?
Lisa,Mmmm.
Lisa,Uh huh.
Lisa,The mirror. The mirror!
Lisa,COME GATHER 'ROUND CHILDREN / IT'S HIGH-TIME YE LEARNS / 'BOUT A HERO NAMED HOMER / AND A DEVIL NAMED BURNS / WE'LL MARCH TILL WE DROP / THE GIRLS AND THE FELLAS / WILL FIGHT TILL THE DEATH OR ELSE FOLD LIKE UMBRELLAS
Lisa,SO WE'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT / BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER / THEY HAVE THE PLANT / BUT WE HAVE THE POWER.
Lisa,SO WE'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT /
Lisa,And that's the tooth!
Lisa,"Like Halloween and Christmas, April Fool's Day traces its origins to pagan ritual."
Lisa,April first used to be the Pagan New Year.
Lisa,The Christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't.
Lisa,Now who's laughing? Now who's laughing?
Lisa,Dad! I was telling the story.
Lisa,Arrrgh!
Lisa,So did mine.
Lisa,Arrrgh!
Lisa,Arrrgh!
Lisa,"Hey, we know you're tough, Dad. Remember that time you got lost in the forest?"
Lisa,Is a coma painful?
Lisa,Eww.
Lisa,"I wish I'd gotten to know you better, Dad. But there were times when we really connected."
Lisa,"Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
Lisa,Why?
Lisa,"I wrote this for you, Dad."
Lisa,"Bart, you can't go on like this."
Lisa,We're a family again!
Lisa,You were in that coma for seven weeks.
Lisa,It's so sad that Krusty is ashamed of his roots.
Lisa,Lois Sanborn.
Lisa,This is a rather lifeless outing.
Lisa,That's as bad as the tasteless Itchy and Sambo cartoons of the late 30s. The writers should be ashamed of themselves.
Lisa,"Yeah, sort of."
Lisa,"Write a cartoon ourselves? Bart, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Lisa,"According to this book, the first thing we need is a setting."
Lisa,Great.
Lisa,Scratchy is getting a haircut. Then Itchy -- the barber -- chops Scratchy's head off with a razor!
Lisa,Finished. Now all we have to do is put our names on it.
Lisa,No way.
Lisa,"Look there's only one reasonable way to settle this: rock, paper, scissors."
Lisa,Paper.
Lisa,"Bart, they rejected our script."
Lisa,Maybe he just doesn't take us seriously 'cause we're kids. Let's put a grownup's name on it.
Lisa,"No, we're just curious."
Lisa,"Grampa, how'd you take off your underwear without taking off your pants?"
Lisa,Bart! Our Cartoon's on TV!
Lisa,... then we put your name on the script and sent it in.
Lisa,"Grampa, we could write the scripts for you and split the money three ways."
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,"Wow, it must be expensive to produce all these cartoons."
Lisa,They said their insurance won't cover you.
Lisa,"I guess nobody likes the truth, huh Grampa."
Lisa,"January 8, 1815. Two weeks after the war ended."
Lisa,Oh no. No!
Lisa,It's all so barbaric.
Lisa,I learned how many drams in a pennyweight.
Lisa,Whacking Day is coming.
Lisa,But killing snakes is evil.
Lisa,Excuse me.
Lisa,Dad?
Lisa,"Dad, everyone likes Whacking Day, but I hate it. Is there something wrong with me?"
Lisa,"Then, what should I do?"
Lisa,Yeah.
Lisa,Yeah.
Lisa,Let me see that.
Lisa,"Dad please, for the last time, I beg you, don't lower yourself to the level of the mob."
Lisa,If the snakes were in here we could protect them.
Lisa,"Oh, good idea! Let's see... bass, bass... ""Tiny Tim""... ""The Chipmunks Greatest Hits""... ""A Castrato Christmas""..."
Lisa,"Mr. White, can we borrow you for a minute?"
Lisa,In here!
Lisa,Now wait a minute. How can you people turn on snakes after all they've done for you?
Lisa,"Mrs. Glick, who killed all those rats in your basement?"
Lisa,"Mom, can you bring me more O.J.?"
Lisa,"Mom, I need more O.J."
Lisa,"Mom, I need more O.J."
Lisa,O.J.
Lisa,O.J.
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,You're a latter-day Clarence Darrow.
Lisa,"You're still my hero, Mom."
Lisa,"Excuse me, but I think if we all do our fair share, we can keep this house clean."
Lisa,It seems like I've been wearing the same red dress forever.
Lisa,"Oh Mom, I've missed you so much."
Lisa,We've gotta clean this up before mom gets back.
Lisa,"I don't think they're giving you enough information, Dad."
Lisa,I can't believe it. Our first glimpse of Gabbo!
Lisa,That's the same time as Krusty the Klown!
Lisa,"Yeah, well Krusty stole it from Steve Allen."
Lisa,"Two wrongs don't make a right, Bart."
Lisa,No they don't.
Lisa,No they don't.
Lisa,Dad...
Lisa,He's a big TV star.
Lisa,"Hey Bart, If we get all of these big stars to appear on a special with Krusty, it might get his career going again."
Lisa,"Miss Midler, I can't believe you do this all by yourself."
Lisa,We were asking you to appear on Krusty's come back special.
Lisa,Krusty! What have you done to yourself?
Lisa,You mean those diet milkshakes?
Lisa,We're getting 50% of the T-shirt sales.
Lisa,Wow an original Malibu Stacey from 1958. Oooh.
Lisa,Oh my.
Lisa,"Bart, look! It's Dad!"
Lisa,"Wow, look at all this Be Sharps merchandise! Lunch boxes, coffee mugs, funny foam..."
Lisa,I can't believe you're not still popular.
Lisa,What about Bob Hope? He's been consistently popular for over 50 years.
Lisa,Dean Martin still packs 'em in.
Lisa,But there are still a few things I don't get. Like how come we never heard about this until today?
Lisa,Why haven't you hung up your gold record?
Lisa,The Fox network has sunk to a new low.
Lisa,"It's from my pen pal, Anya!"
Lisa,"Bart, what's wrong with you?"
Lisa,"That's good, Dad."
Lisa,Yeah!
Lisa,"Bart, I figured it out. Who's someone you've been making irritating phone calls to for years?"
Lisa,"No, someone who didn't deserve it."
Lisa,Hello Moe?
Lisa,We know you're the one behind this. So knock it off or we're going to the cops.
Lisa,Sideshow Bob!
Lisa,"Hey look! ""The FBI Light Opera Society Sings the Complete Gilbert and Sullivan."""
Lisa,THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL ARE WE / PERT AS A SCHOOLGIRL WELL CAN BE / FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH GIRLISH GLEE / THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL...
Lisa,"Oh, no! Dad's been drugged!"
Lisa,"Dad, don't let these application essays throw you. Let's see... ""List your three favorite books and how they've influenced your life."""
Lisa,No.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"Dad, nerds are nothing to fear. In fact they've done some pretty memorable things. Some nerds of note include; popcorn magnate, Orville Redenbacher, rock star, David Byrne and Supreme Court Justice David Souter."
Lisa,"Oh, those baby ducks were so cute. I can't believe they let us walk right up and feed them."
Lisa,We stopped five minutes ago.
Lisa,I heard about this. This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy.
Lisa,Plug it in! Plug it in!
Lisa,The TV! The TV!
Lisa,It's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- Can't we do something?
Lisa,"No you didn't. You only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong."
Lisa,"Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart."
Lisa,Does either of you know what incontinent means?
Lisa,I'd like to believe that this time. I really would.
Lisa,I knew it.
Lisa,Bobo. It's Mr. Burns' bear all right.
Lisa,I think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much.
Lisa,Is it my imagination or is TV getting worse?
Lisa,Wait! Doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial?
Lisa,"Dad, I wouldn't go outside if I were you."
Lisa,"Nope. It says right there, school bus."
Lisa,"Bart, what's wrong?"
Lisa,And...?
Lisa,"Excuse me, Bart's a little upset this morning, so could everyone please be extra-nice to him?"
Lisa,"No, no, they're wrong! The creature they seek is the walking undead. Nosferatu! Das Wampyre!"
Lisa,A vampire!
Lisa,"Ah, there's something fishy about this whole setup."
Lisa,"Dad, do you notice anything strange?"
Lisa,"Eww, Dad, this is blood."
Lisa,Whoops. Bart and I have to go wash up.
Lisa,You're probably right. Let's just go back...
Lisa,Satisfied?
Lisa,Look!
Lisa,Oh my God!
Lisa,"Please, Bart, I've seen your stupid Shemp."
Lisa,"Yeah, I've seen your Curly too."
Lisa,"Mom, Dad! Mr. Burns is a vampire, and he has Bart!"
Lisa,No! No!
Lisa,"The only way to get Bart back is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns."
Lisa,"No, Dad."
Lisa,You must drive this stake right through his heart.
Lisa,"Uh, Dad, that's his crotch."
Lisa,It's so nice having everything back to normal.
Lisa,Grampa's a vampire?!
Lisa,"But, no, we killed Mr. Burns."
Lisa,You're the head vampire?
Lisa,Mom?!
Lisa,"Happy Halloween, everybody!"
Lisa,"LU, LU, LU / LU LU LU LU LU / LU LU LU LU LU LU LU"
Lisa,"Have a blast, Mom!"
Lisa,Sure Dad.
Lisa,"Hey, Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter."
Lisa,"Mr. Hutz, why are you burning all your personal papers?"
Lisa,"Don't worry, Mr. Hutz is still here to take care of us."
Lisa,"I always knew some day Mom would violently rise up, and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors."
Lisa,"Quit it, Bart. Quit it. Quit it. Quit it. Mom, Bart's making faces."
Lisa,What is it?
Lisa,"Dad, this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering."
Lisa,I'm going to have my wedding here.
Lisa,"Um... Uh, well... Uh..."
Lisa,Are you mad?
Lisa,"We know, Dad."
Lisa,What!?
Lisa,This is madness. He's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
Lisa,Is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich?
Lisa,"It's simple, Bart. You've defined yourself as a rebel. And in the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted."
Lisa,"Ever since that self-help guy came to town, you've lost your identity. You've fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-hour-photo, instant-oatmeal society."
Lisa,"Well, this is your chance to develop a new and better identity. May I suggest ""good-natured doormat?"""
Lisa,"No! Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. It's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery."
Lisa,"Dad, sit down."
Lisa,"Tsk, tsk. The remorse of the sugar junkie."
Lisa,Really? Not even this?
Lisa,"The few, the proud, the geeky."
Lisa,"Oh, Bart, cartoons don't have to be one hundred percent realistic."
Lisa,"Dad, look, I made fish sticks. They're burned on the outside, but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out."
Lisa,"Dad, why are you singing?"
Lisa,Are you hiding something from me?
Lisa,"Judging from your song, you're infatuated with a woman named Mindy... or a man named Andy."
Lisa,"Dad, I'm not gonna fall for that."
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,"Dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you."
Lisa,Gimme those.
Lisa,"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor."
Lisa,"This piggy bank contains fifteen dollars I've saved from my allowance. It isn't much, but I would like to help."
Lisa,"Mom, we're having a geography pageant at school, and I don't know which state to go as."
Lisa,No. Nevada makes my butt look big.
Lisa,"Dad, what do you think?"
Lisa,Do you get the feeling this family is disintegrating? I mean we haven't had a meal with Mom all week. And she hasn't even started my costume for the Geography Pageant.
Lisa,There's nothing to eat for breakfast.
Lisa,Maybe Mom just doesn't realize we miss her. We could go down to the casino and let her know.
Lisa,Mommm!
Lisa,I just had a bad dream.
Lisa,"Well, I know it's absurd, but I dreamed the Boogeyman was after me and he's hiding..."
Lisa,Does this mean you'll help me with my costume?
Lisa,"Thanks, Mom."
Lisa,"Dad, Mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume, and she's not and the Geography Pageant is tonight."
Lisa,"But Dad, if I don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of Florida, I'll be the laughing stock of the whole school."
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,"I'm not a state, I'm a monster!"
Lisa,"Wake up, Dad! Wake up! There was a burglar and he took my saxophone."
Lisa,YOU had a stamp collection?
Lisa,"Bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't. That saxophone was my one creative outlet. It was the only way I could truly express myself."
Lisa,"We are insured, aren't we, Mom?"
Lisa,What's the point of all these precautions? I've already lost the only thing that matters to me.
Lisa,"What, this jug?"
Lisa,Thank you.
Lisa,"Dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? I mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?"
Lisa,And I still don't have my saxophone.
Lisa,World domination?
Lisa,"Dad, maybe this will cheer you up."
Lisa,"Oh, Grampa. They pelted you too?"
Lisa,What? Who? Huh? What?
Lisa,"Wow! How'd you track him down, Grampa?"
Lisa,"Thank you. And thank you, Dad. You got it back, just like you said you would."
Lisa,Why are you so happy?
Lisa,"You're right, Bart. School is for losers."
Lisa,"And that's how I cured all disease, ended war, and reunited the entire cast of TV's ""Facts Of Life"", including long time hold-out, Tootie."
Lisa,"Hush, field trip boy."
Lisa,Impaled on my Nobel Peace Prize. How ironic.
Lisa,Why? I'm so much happier here.
Lisa,I've got a weekend job helping the poor. And I'm only eight.
Lisa,This biography of Bart came out awfully quickly. It's not even about him.
Lisa,But inside it's mostly about Ross Perot. And the last two chapters are excerpts from the Oliver North trial.
Lisa,Like what?
Lisa,"Forget it, Dad. If I ever become famous, I want it to be for something worthwhile, not because of some obnoxious fad."
Lisa,"And now you can go back to just being you, instead of a one-dimensional character with a silly catchphrase."
Lisa,If anyone wants me I'll be in my room.
Lisa,"Dad, you should blow the whistle on the Kwik-E-Mart."
Lisa,"Dad, are you listening to me?"
Lisa,I can see through time.
Lisa,Mmm corn. Haven't had that in awhile.
Lisa,Bye!
Lisa,And he taught me how to play the shenai.
Lisa,I think what my father's saying is you're like a member of the family now.
Lisa,THEY MADE DAD SICKY-MART.
Lisa,Isn't there anything you can do to get your job back?
Lisa,Dad... That's over ten thousand miles away.
Lisa,That's over sixteen thousand kilometers.
Lisa,"Dad, Dad!"
Lisa,What'd ya bring? What'd ya bring?
Lisa,"I'm sorry, Apu. But remember, Who needs a Kwik-E-Mart--"
Lisa,Awww.
Lisa,Awww.
Lisa,"Thanks. ""Mr. Simpson. Stop. Your constant letters are becoming a nuisance. Stop. If you do not cease, I will be forced to pursue legal action. Stop. Signed, Boris Karloff, Hollywood, California."""
Lisa,"I'm warning you, Mom -- I may get a little crazy."
Lisa,"Hey, horse-face! Git yer ugly pie-hooks off that Summer Fun Set!"
Lisa,"Thanks for buying us these toys, Grampa."
Lisa,A hush falls over the General Assembly as Stacy approaches the podium to deliver what will no doubt be a stirring and memorable address.
Lisa,"Come on, Stacy. I've waited my whole life to hear you speak. Don't you have anything relevant to say?"
Lisa,"It's not funny, Bart! Millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act! That they can never be anything more than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a rich husband, and spend all day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband!!"
Lisa,Don't you people see anything wrong with what Malibu Stacy says?
Lisa,"No, Celeste, I mean the things she says are sexist."
Lisa,They cannot keep making dolls like this! Something has to be done!
Lisa,"I can't believe you're just gonna stand by as your daughters grow up in a world where this, this is their role model."
Lisa,That's it! I'm calling the company!
Lisa,Mom! We could go on the factory tour and I could complain in person!
Lisa,I have one.
Lisa,"Is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by Malibu Stacy intentional, or is it just a horrible mistake?"
Lisa,It's awful being a kid. No one listens to you.
Lisa,"Well, I'm not gonna accomplish anything just sitting here--"
Lisa,Action! I've got to talk to that woman who invented Malibu Stacy and see if I can get her to --
Lisa,You're getting a job.
Lisa,I thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the inventor of Malibu Stacy.
Lisa,Thanks.
Lisa,"No, it couldn't be..."
Lisa,Excuse me. Miss Lovell? I'd like to talk to you about Malibu Stacy.
Lisa,Am I the first?
Lisa,I want you to hear what Malibu Stacy is telling a generation of little girls.
Lisa,Change what she says. It's your company.
Lisa,That's awful!
Lisa,"But you are Malibu Stacy, and as long as she has your name, you have a responsibility. I'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the Simpson name on it."
Lisa,"But if you can learn from Malibu Stacy's mistakes, so can everyone. I'm sure we can think of something together. C'mon!"
Lisa,"No you're not! Uh, I'll come back tomorrow."
Lisa,"I've got the solution -- you and I are gonna make our own talking doll. She'll have the wisdom of Gertrude Stein and the wit of Cathy Guisewite, the tenacity of Nina Totenberg and the common sense of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. And to top it off, the down-to-earth good looks of Eleanor Roosevelt!"
Lisa,Make sure you get my Mom's hair just right.
Lisa,How about me?
Lisa,"""...When I get married, I'm keeping my own name."" You know, that should probably be if I choose to get married."
Lisa,All right! Now all we need is a name.
Lisa,"How about ""Minerva,"" after the Roman goddess of wisdom?"
Lisa,This is great! They're really gonna sell our doll.
Lisa,Really?
Lisa,"Dad, did you hear something?"
Lisa,Wait! Don't be fooled! She's just a regular Malibu Stacy with a stupid cheap hat! She still embodies all the awful stereotypes she did before.
Lisa,"Well, I guess you can't beat big business. There's just no room for the little guy."
Lisa,"You know, if we get through to just that one little girl, it'll all be worth it."
Lisa,What?
Lisa,"How doth the hero, strong and brave, a celestial path in the heavens pave!"
Lisa,"Go, Dad, go."
Lisa,"What are you basing that on, Mom?"
Lisa,"Come on, Dad, you can make it."
Lisa,"Yeah, Dad. How many people have seen the ice caps and the deserts all at once, or the majesty of the northern lights from one hundred miles above?"
Lisa,What's so special about this game anyway? It's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between Springfield and Shelbyville. They built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. They made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall.
Lisa,"Dad and Ned Flanders friends? What's next... ""A's"" on Bart's report card?"
Lisa,"Don't worry, Bart. It seems like every week something odd happens to the Simpsons. My advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure."
Lisa,That's the spirit.
Lisa,We got the recipe from the Fruit Punch Advisory Board.
Lisa,Yeah. Maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
Lisa,"Hi, Mom."
Lisa,"And I'm going to the park to jam with the Little White Girls Blues Quartet. Wanna come with me, Daddy-o?"
Lisa,Me too.
Lisa,They're having a great time and I'm stuck in here.
Lisa,We won't.
Lisa,You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing. Which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
Lisa,"He's hungry. Here you go, Stampy. Eat it slow. It has to last for..."
Lisa,You ate it too fast.
Lisa,"You can't do that, Dad. It's cruel."
Lisa,"He can't just eat peanuts, Dad. He needs plants to live."
Lisa,"No, Dad. He's grooming him."
Lisa,"Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?"
Lisa,I think they're trying to get some attention.
Lisa,"Yeah well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels."
Lisa,"It's perfect, Dad."
Lisa,"Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer. His boots are ivory, his hat is ivory, and I'm pretty sure that check is ivory."
Lisa,Mr. Blackheart?
Lisa,Are you an ivory dealer?
Lisa,Mom! Dad! Bart and Stampy are gone!
Lisa,"I'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad."
Lisa,A deer!
Lisa,"Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?"
Lisa,Dad! You're sinking!
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,"Dad, feline means cat."
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,Ow! My hair!
Lisa,I propose to you that your heir need not be a boy. In this phallocentric society of ours...
Lisa,"Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet."
Lisa,It couldn't possibly be bottomless.
Lisa,"Hey Mom, Bart's throwing peas."
Lisa,Ow! That was a big one.
Lisa,"Just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction that Bart's absence has left in our hearts."
Lisa,"Yeah, me too. That midget taught me a lot about his native Estonia."
Lisa,Just take one of my geodes. The rocks on my desk.
Lisa,"No, that's a Trilobite... That's petrified wood... Bart, that's a bran"
Lisa,muffin.
Lisa,That's guilt. You feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job.
Lisa,"Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner could become any more of a square, but there's the proof."
Lisa,"I think you need Skinner, Bart. Everybody needs a nemesis. Sherlock Holmes had his Dr. Moriarty. Mountain Dew has its Mello-Yello. Even Maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow."
Lisa,"They're not ""imprisoning us,"" Bart. They're..."
Lisa,Otto!
Lisa,You started off as the bad cop. But now you're the good one. You and Willie got mixed up about ten minutes ago.
Lisa,Now you're the good cop.
Lisa,How do you know? There weren't any witnesses.
Lisa,You'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party like that.
Lisa,"You're a witness? Bart, you have to tell the police."
Lisa,Why?
Lisa,"Oh, I see. If you testify, Skinner will know you skipped school. Well, if Freddy Quimby didn't do it, I'm sure he'll be found innocent by a fair and impartial jury."
Lisa,I knew it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail.
Lisa,Only because Mayor Quimby's buying his nephew's freedom.
Lisa,"Well Bart, because of you, a horrible, yet innocent person is going to jail."
Lisa,Chicks on the bench...
Lisa,"So Bart, have your insides been gnawed away by guilt, yet?"
Lisa,"Maggie, can you point to the credenza?"
Lisa,We didn't invite the other babies. Maggie doesn't seem to get along with the other babies.
Lisa,HOT DOGS / ARMOUR HOT DOGS...
Lisa,WHAT KINDS OF KIDS EAT ARMOUR HOT DOGS?
Lisa,SKINNY KIDS...
Lisa,TOUGH KIDS...
Lisa,Doesn't this family know any songs that aren't commercials?
Lisa,"Oh. That is so cool, that is so exciting, that is so... crappy."
Lisa,It looks like part of Scratchy's arm.
Lisa,Yeesh. How much was it?
Lisa,Oooh.
Lisa,Where's Grampa? Wasn't he invited?
Lisa,Sneh.
Lisa,"I think it's great you're a teacher, Dad. So, will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more Socratic method of interactive class participation?"
Lisa,I find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.
Lisa,Me too.
Lisa,"I'll tell you a secret, Bart. Every time I'm worried about Mom and Dad, I go to the attic and add to my ball of string."
Lisa,"Here, Dad. I brought you some nice..."
Lisa,"Dad, that's just a plant."
Lisa,"Look, I brought you some nice pudding."
Lisa,"Dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. There's a reason two people come together and stay together. There's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. If you want to get Mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can."
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"Good luck, Dad."
Lisa,"I'm really glad you're back, Dad. I knew you could do it. Now don't screw it up."
Lisa,"Ah, face it, Bart. Our salvation isn't just gonna roll by on the Back of some stupid truck."
Lisa,POOL MOBILE?!!
Lisa,Time's up?!
Lisa,Dad...
Lisa,Dad...
Lisa,Dad...
Lisa,"Dad, as you know, we've been swimming. And we've developed a taste for it. We both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go. Now before you respond, you must understand that your refusal would result in months and months of..."
Lisa,CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? Canwe... etc.
Lisa,"Yes, Dad."
Lisa,"Oh, look. Bart's all alone. Maybe I should keep him company, at least for a little while."
Lisa,Coming!
Lisa,"Dad... You have to put chlorine in the water every day, to keep it clean."
Lisa,"Uh, Bart...?"
Lisa,Sorry. I just came to see how you were feeling.
Lisa,What are you writing here? A play?
Lisa,"Yuh huh. ""Cast of Characters: Viceroy Fizzlebottom, a hearty cherub of a man..."""
Lisa,"Oh, well, y'know, it ain't so great. Bart, it's the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole life! Well, anyway, I brought you a present."
Lisa,"Look, it's the telescope I won at the Optics Festival."
Lisa,But...
Lisa,"Thanks, Nelson."
Lisa,"Shut up, brain! I got friends now. I don't need you anymore. Duh, yeah, I'd love to go to your house."
Lisa,"Hello? Hey, I'm stuck in here. I gotta think of a way to get out."
Lisa,"Bart, I'm really sorry I've been ignoring you lately. I got carried away with being popular. But now that I'm unpopular again, I want you to know I'm here for you."
Lisa,"Bart, I'm here for you but, I'm not gonna break into somebody's house."
Lisa,"I'm goin', I'm goin!"
Lisa,Oh!
Lisa,It's my room and I can do what I want.
Lisa,"Bart, quit it!"
Lisa,"Mom, I'm auditioning for first chair in the school band and I've got to practice!"
Lisa,Fine. I'll play outside.
Lisa,"Sorry, Ralph. That would defeat the purpose of testing as a means of student evaluation."
Lisa,Ooh! Ooh!
Lisa,I never made Miss Hoover yow-wee.
Lisa,"Hi, Allison? I'm Lisa Simpson. Oh, it's great to finally meet someone who converses above the normal eight-year-old-level."
Lisa,"You're younger than me, too?"
Lisa,"No. I just like to smell my lunch... Gee, I never met anyone who skipped a grade before."
Lisa,"Well, I'm sure I could have, but I'd hate to leave behind all my wonderful friends."
Lisa,"Uh! Hey, Sara! Well, I gotta go. I have to practice for band auditions."
Lisa,The sax.
Lisa,I'm going for first chair this year.
Lisa,"Wow, with so much in common, I'm sure we'll be the best of friends."
Lisa,"Me, too."
Lisa,Mom.
Lisa,Why am I still rotting away in the second grade instead of being skipped ahead?
Lisa,"Well, did you ever talk to anyone at the school? Make a few calls on my behalf? Maybe you could've been ""nicer"" to Principal Skinner, if you know what I mean."
Lisa,It hurts my teeth.
Lisa,And it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it...
Lisa,I won first chair?
Lisa,What's happening... Oh... it was just a dream.
Lisa,I won first chair?
Lisa,"I need help, Mom. There's another girl at school who's smarter, younger, and a better sax player than me. Oh I feel so average."
Lisa,But she's better than me at everything that makes me special.
Lisa,"You're thinking of bears, Mom."
Lisa,"I can't tell you either, Ralph."
Lisa,"Ah, that used to be my face in the mud..."
Lisa,"I appreciate the offer, but it goes against every moral fiber in my body."
Lisa,I don't need a card. You live in the room next to me.
Lisa,"Hey, I am above average! So what if Allison's ahead of me? There's no shame in being second."
Lisa,Why would they come to our concert just to boo us?
Lisa,"Give it to me! Hey wait, there's nothing bad here."
Lisa,"I've got to stop being so petty. I should be Allison's friend, not her competitor. I mean, she is a wonderful person."
Lisa,I prefer my phrasing.
Lisa,You're a wonderful person.
Lisa,Oh really? I...
Lisa,Jeremy's Iron.
Lisa,What's this?
Lisa,You're finished already? But the competition isn't for weeks.
Lisa,It's great. It's really great.
Lisa,"Look, Bart. It almost killed me, but I hand-crafted all seventy-five characters from Oliver Twist. And now the coup de grace - a bitter snowstorm."
Lisa,Is it okay?!
Lisa,Oh who am I kidding? There's no way I'm ever gonna beat Allison!
Lisa,I'll do whatever it takes.
Lisa,Relatively?
Lisa,"Bart, her being wet won't help me win the competition."
Lisa,Perfect!
Lisa,Enough with the hose!
Lisa,"It's the beating of that hideous heart! I mean, I think I hear something."
Lisa,"Why, here's Allison's real diorama. It got misplaced, ...or so it would seem."
Lisa,"After the way I've behaved, I don't deserve to win."
Lisa,What?
Lisa,"I'm really sorry about what I did, Allison. It's no shame being second to you."
Lisa,Only if we're the best.
Lisa,"Hey, Ralph. Want to come with me and Allison to play anagrams?"
Lisa,"Not exactly. They pieced it together from old shows, and it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth."
Lisa,Ren and Stimpy do it all the time.
Lisa,"Mom, romance is dead. It was acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney. Homogenized, then sold off piece by piece."
Lisa,Happy Valentine's.
Lisa,"Yes, I do. And just like your love stories, it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal."
Lisa,It started appropriately enough with an innocent boy being embarrassed on Valentine's Day...
Lisa,Poor Ralph.
Lisa,"Here you go, Ralph."
Lisa,"It was an unusually warm February 14th, so the children walked home without jackets."
Lisa,"Sure, I guess."
Lisa,Glad you liked it.
Lisa,Yeah. Nice gag.
Lisa,"Well, here's my house."
Lisa,"Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph."
Lisa,"Oh, a Malibu Stacy Convertible! ""Look in the tunk."" He must mean trunk."
Lisa,Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show!
Lisa,"No, thanks."
Lisa,Aw.
Lisa,Oh no. Please don't show me with Ralph.
Lisa,Noooo!!
Lisa,"Now you listen to me -- I don't like you. I never liked you, and the only reason I gave you that stupid valentine is 'cause nobody else would!"
Lisa,"Mom, doesn't any love story have a happy ending?"
Lisa,That didn't seem like a happy ending.
Lisa,That seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation.
Lisa,"Sorry, Mom. I've decided to save my love for someone who is guaranteed not to reject me."
Lisa,"Soon, Corey, soon."
Lisa,"Ah, your first kiss."
Lisa,Dad! Remember how you said that going to Itchy and Scratchy Land would be too damned expensive?
Lisa,Can we?
Lisa,Yayyyyyy!
Lisa,Yayyy!
Lisa,We're going to Itchy and Scratchy Land!
Lisa,Mom! Dad! Bart's dead!
Lisa,"You know, Itchy and Scratchy Land isn't just for kids. They have a place called Parents Island."
Lisa,"Yeah. ""Dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars and saloons, and a world class chemical dependency center."""
Lisa,Yayyyy!
Lisa,"Okay, bye-bye / Bye / Bye, Grampa."
Lisa,Haven't we stood in five different states long enough?
Lisa,Cool! / Neat-o!
Lisa,Ow!
Lisa,"Mom, that's veal."
Lisa,"Awww, look at that cute little baby axe."
Lisa,Who are all these characters?
Lisa,Oh yeah. They weren't very funny.
Lisa,I wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us?
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,"Don't do it, Bart."
Lisa,"Dad, I think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend."
Lisa,"Dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits."
Lisa,Just keep taking pictures.
Lisa,"Yeah, best ever."
Lisa,"But Mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation. It brought us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors, and we have so many memories."
Lisa,"No, Mom. He's right. Observe."
Lisa,"I don't like him either Mom, but I'm doing a report on local politics for my school project."
Lisa,"Dad, I had to listen to this jerk all morning. Can we listen to something else?"
Lisa,That sounds like Sideshow Bob!
Lisa,"Dad, I'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who Sideshow Bob is."
Lisa,"Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty the Clown's sidekick. But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed robbery and Bart got him put in jail."
Lisa,"When he got out, he married Aunt Selma and tried to murder her."
Lisa,Bart! Your mortal enemy is on the radio!
Lisa,"I meant your other mortal enemy, Sideshow Bob."
Lisa,Uncle Mayor was just saying that us kids are the most important natural resource we have!
Lisa,"This time, he's the lesser of two evils."
Lisa,I hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there.
Lisa,There's no Councilman Les Wynan.
Lisa,I don't think Bob won that election legally. I can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted felon would get so few.
Lisa,I thought this was a secret ballot.
Lisa,"Okay, Aaron A. Aaronson voted for... Bob. Aaron L. Aaronson voted for... Bob. Arthur B. Ablabab voted for... Bob."
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,"This is so cool, Bart. We're just like Woodward and Bernstein!"
Lisa,No Edgar Neubauer.
Lisa,This is hopeless. They're gonna demolish our house for sure. We're gonna have to move into a Motel 6.
Lisa,"No, Bart, don't you see? Dead people can't vote!"
Lisa,"Look! Prudence Goodwyfe, died 1641. She voted for Bob, too! So did Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, and the Big Bopper!"
Lisa,Even the pet cemetery voted for Bob! Look! Mr. and Mrs. Bananas! Humphrey Boa-gart!
Lisa,"Oh, my poor dead kitty! Please, not you too!"
Lisa,"All right, Bob! Now it's personal!!"
Lisa,I have a plan. I think we can trap him.
Lisa,"You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you when you say you're innocent..."
Lisa,"Because we all know you're a naive pawn, puppet, if you will, of the most diabolical political genius Springfield has ever known -- Birchibald T. Barlow!"
Lisa,"You don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you?"
Lisa,You were Ronnie to his Nancy!
Lisa,Ringo to his rest of the Beatles!
Lisa,"Bart! We did it! Now we get to keep our house, and you get to go back to fourth grade!"
Lisa,"The spoon, Bart."
Lisa,Oh no! We left Grampa back at the gas station.
Lisa,What about Grampa?
Lisa,"Hello. ""We're here."" ""Hi."" etc."
Lisa,"Mom, is Dad gonna kill us?"
Lisa,"Dad, look!"
Lisa,Dad!! Your hand is jammed in the toaster!!
Lisa,Okilly dokilly.
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,Are we taking the new Lexus to Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral today?
Lisa,"Bart, does it strike you as odd that Uter disappeared and suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called Uterbräten?"
Lisa,Mom! Mom! You've gotta help! They're cooking kids in the school cafeteria!
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,ONE --
Lisa,CHORUS LINE OF PEOPLE / DANCIN' TILL THEY MAKE US STOP /
Lisa,"Remember Bart, I mean, ""Dances in Underwear,"" we take the white man alive."
Lisa,"Don't be so hard on yourself, Bart. It's not your fault Jessica doesn't like you."
Lisa,"No, Bart. I just think you and Jessica are too different from each other to get along. She's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter and you're the devil's cabana boy."
Lisa,"I can't believe it, Bart. I'd always thought Jessica was so sweet."
Lisa,You gotta give her up.
Lisa,"Bart, it's naive to think you can change a person. Except maybe that boy who works in the library."
Lisa,Well read and just a little wild. If only someone could tame him.
Lisa,"Bart, be strong. You don't need that little hell cat."
Lisa,So here's where you're hiding.
Lisa,"Bart, we can't just let her get away with this."
Lisa,"Yeah, well I eat Fruit Loops for breakfast."
Lisa,"I know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof. But doesn't the Bible teach us ""Judge not lest ye be judged,"" Reverend?"
Lisa,"There is someone among us with a guilty conscience. After much soul searching I decided it would be wrong of me to name names, but I urge that guilty person here, under the eyes of God, to come forward to confess and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell."
Lisa,I am talking to the collection money thief. Only you can come forward and end this injustice.
Lisa,"Oh, what the heck, it was Jessica Lovejoy."
Lisa,"If you search her room, I am certain you will find the money."
Lisa,That doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report. What if the weatherman is wrong?
Lisa,Snowball fight!
Lisa,I made the snowball from the frost in our freezer.
Lisa,Grades are all I have. What could I be failing? I'm smart and a teacher's pet.
Lisa,Gym?!! That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
Lisa,That's not fair... Why is Bart getting a present and I'm getting chewed out?
Lisa,You mean those leagues where parents push their kids into vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory?
Lisa,"Mom, this is really scary. I'm gonna get my first 'F' ever."
Lisa,Ooooh.
Lisa,"Wow Bart, I'm so impressed you were able to give Milhouse a concussion."
Lisa,"Cut it out, Bart!"
Lisa,"I have to join the team, or I'll get an ""F"" that will haunt me for the rest of my life."
Lisa,He said it was just a name.
Lisa,"Please, Dad, I'll be fine."
Lisa,"You really think I did okay out there, Mom?"
Lisa,"That's very nice, Dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. However, I will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love."
Lisa,"Lay off, guys. He's with me."
Lisa,"Don't worry, Bart, they won't bother you anymore."
Lisa,"Hey Milhouse, knock him down if he's in your way! Jimbo! Jimbo! Go for the face! Look! Ralph Wiggum lost his shin guard! Hack the bone! Hack the bone!"
Lisa,Ma. I think I'm all hugged out. Oh... one more.
Lisa,"Bart, what are you doing in my room?"
Lisa,"Bart, that was your cherished childhood toy."
Lisa,"Bart, just get out of here."
Lisa,That doesn't make sense.
Lisa,Get out! Get out!
Lisa,"Okay. Then I'm going to start kicking air like this. And if any part of you should fill that air, it's your own fault."
Lisa,Bart started it.
Lisa,"You'll have to do better than that tonight, chump."
Lisa,"Don't worry, I'm wearing my lucky rabbit's head."
Lisa,You want a piece of me?
Lisa,Hi Mom! Over here! Mom!
Lisa,For the greater good.
Lisa,"Great game, Bart."
Lisa,"Ew. Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. They go in the trash."
Lisa,How did you get tickets?
Lisa,"No,me!Takeme!Me!Me!Me!"
Lisa,Ashley Grant! You gave a talk on women's issues at my school on how we don't have to be second class citizens.
Lisa,"Eh, sorry about my unenlightened brother. He will make the next few hours a living hell."
Lisa,I'm coming!
Lisa,"Dad, I don't understand. What is she saying you did?"
Lisa,"Sorry, Dad. We do believe in you. We really do."
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"The media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. All they care about is entertainment. Well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word ""entertainment"" -- Public Access Television."
Lisa,Now it's time for the Innocence Report with Homer Simpson.
Lisa,"Dad, you did it! I am so proud of you."
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,"Dad, this clears you completely!"
Lisa,See?
Lisa,"There's you, Dad!"
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,"Mom! Dad! Look, this biography of Peter Uebberoth is only ninety-nine cents! And I found the new Al Gore book!"
Lisa,"Yeah, I hope it's as exciting as his other book ""Rational Thinking: Reasonable Future!"""
Lisa,"Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy."
Lisa,What do you think Mom and Dad are doing right now?
Lisa,"Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it! Why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions? Haven't you heard of Occam's Razor? ""The simplest explanation is probably the correct one."""
Lisa,"I don't know. Maybe they're all reverse vampires, and they have to get home before dark."
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,"No, Dad. I want to get down. This tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me."
Lisa,No! No! No! No!!!
Lisa,"Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary."
Lisa,That's what I assumed.
Lisa,"Look on the bright side, Dad. Did you know that the Chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity?"
Lisa,Hawaii!
Lisa,"C'mon, Bart. They're gonna pamper us. Not literally, of course."
Lisa,"See, Dad. I told you Mom would have problems."
Lisa,"Mom, are you feeling any better?"
Lisa,"Mom, are you sure you don't want to discuss it?"
Lisa,"But if we don't encourage her to vent her feelings, they can come out in other ways."
Lisa,"Mom, you've been cooking all night?"
Lisa,"Mom, can we talk to you?"
Lisa,"Uh, neat... anyway, Mom, maybe you should go into therapy."
Lisa,"Dad, Mom's getting worse. You have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. Look how tense she is."
Lisa,"Dad, I like picking beans with grandma."
Lisa,"Okay, I will."
Lisa,Fine.
Lisa,Hope I do.
Lisa,Warning. Warning. Doctor Smith refuses to do his astro chores.
Lisa,"Danger, danger... My hooks are flailing wildly!"
Lisa,"Ow! Cut it out, Bart."
Lisa,"What do they do there, Dad?"
Lisa,"You don't know what they do there, do you?"
Lisa,"You're a member of the Stonecutters, Grampa?"
Lisa,I still don't believe all the founding fathers were Stonecutters.
Lisa,"Remember, Dad. All glory is fleeting."
Lisa,Beware the Ides of March.
Lisa,"Dad, I know you think you're happy now, but it's not gonna last forever."
Lisa,Don't you see? Getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
Lisa,"Dad, you're not with the Stonecutters now. There are no lackeys around to carry out your every..."
Lisa,You're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.
Lisa,Well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
Lisa,"Dad, that doesn't help people."
Lisa,Yeah!
Lisa,Or an inlet.
Lisa,Why don't we all look at the photo album?
Lisa,Aw.
Lisa,Why aren't there any pictures of Maggie?
Lisa,"Good aim, Dad."
Lisa,I think it's romantic. Throwing off the shackles of the workaday world and following a dream... of sorts.
Lisa,Fine.
Lisa,"So Dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?"
Lisa,Daaad!
Lisa,I hope it's a girl.
Lisa,"You're worried about telling dad, aren't you, mom?"
Lisa,"Well, you've been in my room for about four hours now."
Lisa,I'm gonna get a snack and maybe go to the bathroom.
Lisa,Mom! Make Dad tell the story right.
Lisa,Oh.
Lisa,"So, you loved her right from the start."
Lisa,"Sounds like you had a good day today, Dad."
Lisa,What!?
Lisa,"Don't you realize what's happening, Bart? Your comet is gonna collide with the earth and every living thing in its path will be killed."
Lisa,"But, Dad, don't you think..."
Lisa,"No, Dad, I don't think..."
Lisa,"Daaad, they're firing the rocket!"
Lisa,It blew up the bridge!
Lisa,It's a pony.
Lisa,We have a bomb shelter?
Lisa,"I'd get out, but I don't know where I am."
Lisa,It's breaking up!
Lisa,We're saved!
Lisa,I can't believe that extra thick layer of pollution that I've actually picketed against is what burned up the comet.
Lisa,"Yeah, dad was right."
Lisa,When Krusty wants to he can still blow 'em away.
Lisa,Mom?
Lisa,"Yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley. But Krusty!"
Lisa,"If there has to be a bastardized version of Krusty, I'm glad it's you."
Lisa,"Come on, shampoo! You can do it!"
Lisa,Yay! I won your stupid bathroom products race!
Lisa,"It never spins the other way. In the Northern hemisphere, water always drains counter-clockwise. It's called the Coriolis effect."
Lisa,"Yes, Bart. Why don't you try it and see?"
Lisa,"Bart, water will only go the other way in the Southern Hemisphere."
Lisa,Haven't you ever looked at your globe?
Lisa,"See, the Southern Hemisphere is made up of everything below the Equa... this line."
Lisa,"Uh-huh. In fact, in Rand-McNally, they wear hats on their feet, and hamburgers eat people."
Lisa,"Bart, you can't actually call these places! Don't you know how expensive international calls are?"
Lisa,Hey! I need that!
Lisa,"Office of the Solicitor General? ""Office of the Prime Minister?"" ""Hopping Mad Collection Agency?"" What is all this stuff?"
Lisa,"Uh-oh. Bart, you better talk to Mom and Dad about this."
Lisa,"I know those words, but that sign makes no sense."
Lisa,"It's 6:45 A.M. next Wednesday. You may also be interested to know that it's summer here, not winter."
Lisa,It says you can't bring in outside plants or animals. Any foreign creature you bring in could upset the environmental balance.
Lisa,"Bart, I'm sorry I'm gonna miss your public humiliation, but the Woolumbaloo Dirt Monument is just too exciting to pass up."
Lisa,"Mom, you said I could have one souvenir, right? Well I want a didgeridoo."
Lisa,What?!
Lisa,"Thank you, Bart. I promise I won't make fun of you later for this."
Lisa,I'm impressed that you were able to write so legibly on your own butt.
Lisa,"Well, that's what happens when you introduce foreign species into an ecosystem that can't handle them."
Lisa,How could you forget? They had signs posted all over the library.
Lisa,"You're certainly in a good mood tonight, Dad."
Lisa,"How's Dad, today?"
Lisa,"Hey Dad, whatcha doing?"
Lisa,"Dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival."
Lisa,I didn't turn it on. I thought you turned it on.
Lisa,It is off.
Lisa,That spikey-haired masked dancer is really something. I wonder who he is.
Lisa,"Bart, I am so proud of you. You showed a sensitive side of yourself that can never be erased. From this day forward we are kindred spirits."
Lisa,This is horrible. People will start to avoid Springfield.
Lisa,And... action!
Lisa,Whatcha doin' Ma?
Lisa,Ewww.
Lisa,"I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance..."
Lisa,"Uh, I wasn't talking about you, Dad."
Lisa,"Mr. Sherman, I understand you have two Pulitzer prizes."
Lisa,Wow. How many Pulitzer Prizes winners can do that?
Lisa,THAT IS WHAT I'D TRULY LIKE TO BE/ 'CAUSE IF I WERE AN OSCAR MEYER WEINER...
Lisa,"Mr. Gumbel, this is a Girl Scout meeting."
Lisa,How did you know my name?
Lisa,"Goodbye, Mr. Sherman. If I ever play Carnegie Hall, I'll give you a call."
Lisa,I'll go to the first aid tent and tell them to plug in ye olde stomach pump.
Lisa,Here bunny bunny! Here bunny!
Lisa,"Sorry, I don't believe in fortune telling. I should go."
Lisa,"Wow, you can see into the... present."
Lisa,The Death Card.
Lisa,"Oh, that's cute."
Lisa,That's bad?
Lisa,Guess so.
Lisa,"Hey, watch it! / Watch it!"
Lisa,That man is instantly the most annoying person I've ever met. A soy-based snack will calm me down.
Lisa,Aaagh. Him again.
Lisa,"Hello. I need Ecosystem of the Marsh, by Thompson."
Lisa,No. It couldn't be...
Lisa,That's the book I need. You'll probably take forever with it too.
Lisa,I read at a 78th grade level.
Lisa,Finished this page?
Lisa,Why?
Lisa,Pertaining to a process involving a randomly determined sequence of observations.
Lisa,He can make you laugh with no more than a frantic flailing of his limbs.
Lisa,"Yes, not for their music, but for their tireless efforts to preserve historic buildings."
Lisa,I'd love to. Can we get vegetarian meals at your parents' house?
Lisa,That is good because eating animals is wrong.
Lisa,When will the world learn?
Lisa,I love these new planes.
Lisa,"Beautiful dinnerware, Mrs. Parkfield."
Lisa,"And I love that painting. Judging by the clothes, I'd say seventeenth century."
Lisa,"This place is so enchanting, Hugh. I love it here."
Lisa,"Yes, I will."
Lisa,Hi Mom.
Lisa,Guess what -- Hugh and I are getting married.
Lisa,"Mom, remember when I was little, we'd always plan my dream wedding and you always promised to, you know, well, keep Dad from ruining it?"
Lisa,"Mom, it's a picture phone."
Lisa,Oh.
Lisa,"Mom, picture phone."
Lisa,"It's not you, Milhouse. I just don't plan to ever get married."
Lisa,"Hey, I remember you. Mayor Quimby, right?"
Lisa,Just a couple more blocks to my house.
Lisa,And if they are?
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,"Oh Hugh, thank you. You've been just wonderful through this entire ordeal."
Lisa,Are you okay?
Lisa,"Uh, Mom, we've got my wedding dress fitting this afternoon. Maggie, if you're not doing anything, why don't you come with us?"
Lisa,Hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
Lisa,"All right, Dad! I'm sorry I left you alone with Homer and Bart."
Lisa,How did you get that gash on your forehead?
Lisa,"Oh, you are so good to put up with all of this."
Lisa,"Mom, I feel kinda funny wearing white - I mean, Milhouse."
Lisa,"Okay, I've got something old - that's my pearl necklace. Something new is the wedding dress. Something borrowed is this antique brooch from Hugh's mother. Now I just need something blue."
Lisa,Oh Mom. Thanks.
Lisa,Hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
Lisa,"Hi, Dad."
Lisa,Thanks.
Lisa,Oh Dad...
Lisa,"Dad, you're babbling."
Lisa,"Hey, Dad. Did you forget to give those cufflinks to Hugh?"
Lisa,Well?
Lisa,But you've been going on about these all week. I'm sure he just forgot.
Lisa,What about my family's tradition?
Lisa,But you promised my Dad you would.
Lisa,"I know they look a little silly, but his feelings will be hurt if you don't wear them."
Lisa,Are you saying we won't see my family again?
Lisa,I can't believe I'm hearing this. I don't want to cut my family out of my life.
Lisa,That's a horrible thing to say.
Lisa,Maybe. But I still love them. And I don't think you understand that.
Lisa,"Wow. Now that I know all this, isn't there any way to change the future?"
Lisa,I thought you said you'd tell me about my true love?
Lisa,"Hi, Dad."
Lisa,Wow!
Lisa,"Wow. What else did you do, Dad?"
Lisa,Who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them up?!
Lisa,"If it wasn't you, then who was it?"
Lisa,"What's wrong, boy? Getting tired?"
Lisa,My Bongo drums!
Lisa,What's Santa's Little Helper doing to that dog?
Lisa,"Can we keep Santa's girlfriend, Mom?"
Lisa,"Look, it's twins!"
Lisa,How many more can there be?
Lisa,Wow! Twenty-five puppies!
Lisa,"Mom, why do I have to wear a flea collar?"
Lisa,Nooooooo!
Lisa,"Is that what we do in this family? When someone becomes an inconvenience, we just get rid of them?!"
Lisa,They don't like being broken up.
Lisa,"Mom, don't give the puppies to him! He'll be mean to them!"
Lisa,Let's go find your babies!
Lisa,Who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent little puppies?
Lisa,He's giving them a bath!
Lisa,Maybe we were wrong about Burns on this one.
Lisa,He's gonna make a tuxedo out of our puppies!!!
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,Ssh.
Lisa,We've gotta get you outta here!
Lisa,No Bart! What're you doing?
Lisa,That's cats.
Lisa,"Bart, Look! A laundry chute!"
Lisa,I've got an idea!
Lisa,"Quick, let's get..."
Lisa,But they're ours! You stole them from us!
Lisa,"No, don't! Stay down, Monty! Don't get up! Stay down! Stay down, boy!"
Lisa,Nooo!!
Lisa,"Well, Mr. Burns, I hope you've realized the folly of killing innocent animals for fashion."
Lisa,"Oh, yeah. I didn't think this was for me."
Lisa,"I've never seen them fight like that, Bart. I'm worried that all this posturing and saber-rattling could lead to a teachers strike."
Lisa,Oh no. Strike?
Lisa,"Horrible news, Mom!"
Lisa,"Luckily I've prepared for this, so I'm not too worried."
Lisa,Oh yeah.
Lisa,"But Dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive."
Lisa,"I've got some textbooks, but without state approved syllabi and standardized testing my education can only go so far."
Lisa,"Relax? I can't relax. Nor can I yield, relent, or... Only two synonyms? Oh my God! I'm losing my perspicacity!"
Lisa,"So if we were in school this week, what do you think we'd be learning?"
Lisa,"Grade me! Look at me! Evaluate and rank me! Oh -- I'm good, good, good, and oh so smart! Grade me!"
Lisa,Pointless.
Lisa,"Well, my teacher's a nightmare. Three kids got sick from inhaling his ointment fumes, he confiscated everything made of tin, and then he sent us home early because he got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener."
Lisa,There's no way I'll get into an Ivy League school now. At this rate I probably won't even get into Vassar.
Lisa,"Mom, I think he's serious."
Lisa,"How're you feelin', big brother?"
Lisa,"I'm glad you're okay, Bart."
Lisa,Bleeding Gums Murphy!
Lisa,It's been a long time.
Lisa,Ew. How'd you get a name like that?
Lisa,Yeah.
Lisa,My brother just had his appendix out.
Lisa,He'll be fine.
Lisa,What about your family?
Lisa,It must be awful to be all alone in the world.
Lisa,When was the last time you worked?
Lisa,Your sax! Thank you so much!
Lisa,"Wow, you've had some career. Although the moral seems to be that a lifetime of jazz leaves you sad and lonely."
Lisa,I sure am. Look!
Lisa,I stopped brushing my teeth so I can play just like you!
Lisa,"LIFT ME, WON'T YOU LIFT ME / ABOVE THE OLD ROUTINE / MAKE IT NICE, PLAY IT CLEAN, JAZZMAN..."
Lisa,"WHEN THE JAZZMAN'S TESTI-FYIN' A FAITHLESS MAN BELIEVES / HE CAN SING YOU INTO PARADISE / OR BRING YOU TO YOUR KNEES / JAZZMAN, OH JAZZMAN..."
Lisa,"Hey, Bleeding Gums! I was great! And I owe it all to..."
Lisa,What happened to Mr. Murphy?
Lisa,Bleeding Gums was my hero and I never got to tell him how I felt.
Lisa,But he was the only person who had the same love for music that I do.
Lisa,"Thank you. Oh Dad, why did he have to die?"
Lisa,Uh huh.
Lisa,Yeah.
Lisa,"Oh, Dad!"
Lisa,How come?
Lisa,"Uh, maybe I need to talk to somebody with a little more age and wisdom."
Lisa,Grampa!
Lisa,It's only Maggie.
Lisa,That's only the cat.
Lisa,"That's Maggie again, Grampa."
Lisa,How come it won't stop hurting?
Lisa,Isn't anybody gonna show up?
Lisa,No! It was Bleeding Gums Murphy.
Lisa,Saxophone! He was a jazz musician.
Lisa,You didn't know him! Nobody knew him! But he was a great man! And I won't rest until all of Springfield knows the name of Bleeding Gums Murphy!
Lisa,"Mom, I want to honor Bleeding Gums' memory, but I don't know where to start."
Lisa,"Hi, I have a request. I would like you to do a tribute to Bleeding Gums Murphy, please."
Lisa,What if I could find it?
Lisa,"Gee, your station has a lot of problems."
Lisa,Two hundred and fifty dollars! But I need that album to honor the memory of Bleeding Gums Murphy.
Lisa,Where am I gonna get five hundred dollars?
Lisa,Bart! I can't believe it... But why?
Lisa,Oh thank you. But five hundred dollars! You'll never see that much money again!
Lisa,I got the album!
Lisa,"I did the best I could, Bleeding Gums."
Lisa,"That was for you, Bleeding Gums."
Lisa,I don't want you to go!
Lisa,Good-bye.
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,"WHEN THE JAZZMAN'S TESTI-FYIN' A FAITHLESS MAN BELIEVES / HE CAN SING YOU INTO PARADISE / OR BRING YOU TO YOUR KNEES / JAZZMAN, TAKE MY BLUES AWAY ..."
Lisa,One more time!
Lisa,"Hey Mom, is this how you caught him?"
Lisa,"Mom, was catching that guy the most incredibly exciting thing you've ever done?"
Lisa,"Mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to throw yourself in front of him and take the bullet?"
Lisa,"Whatever you do, mom, we'll be proud of you."
Lisa,As long as it's constitutional.
Lisa,"So, Mom, what are you gonna do with your day off?"
Lisa,"Mom's police tape isn't a toy, Dad."
Lisa,"Mom, I know your intentions are good, but aren't the police a protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elites? Don't you think we ought to attack the roots of social problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons?"
Lisa,"Bust 'im, Mom! / Get 'im, Mom! / Nail 'im! / You can do it!"
Lisa,It's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire.
Lisa,I don't even want any. I just bought a pity glass...
Lisa,Tutoring? The only thing Bart's teaching is guerilla combat in Shelbyville.
Lisa,"No, Mom! Bart and some kids ran off to wage war on Shelbyville."
Lisa,I'd like to start a jazz program for the music department. We've got a really great instructor lined up...
Lisa,He's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo circuit and settle into a nice teaching job.
Lisa,"Let's go now, Mr. Puente."
Lisa,"It is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart. And even if the Three Stooges were alive, I doubt they'd want to hang around with you."
Lisa,"Oh, no. that's awful, Mr. Puente. What? Oh. He owns the nuclear power plant. Yeah, I'd like to settle his hash, too."
Lisa,"Dad, how can you work for a man like Mr. Burns?"
Lisa,"""Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie."" Dad, this doesn't have your name on it."
Lisa,"Sorry, Grampa. It's just that, for a second, it looked like Dad had melted."
Lisa,He robbed the school of music!
Lisa,Everyone in Springfield had a reason to shoot Mr. Burns. Even us.
Lisa,"Bart, he broke your dog's legs. Grampa, he destroyed your home. And Dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name."
Lisa,"Yeah, I was just getting to me. Because of Mr. Burns, they canceled my jazz program, and my friend Tito Puente got fired. But I could never shoot someone."
Lisa,Could not!
Lisa,Could not!
Lisa,Could not!
Lisa,Could not!
Lisa,We don't have an outhouse.
Lisa,Look at Burns' suit. Yeesh.
Lisa,"Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is. The rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason."
Lisa,"Well, I don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder."
Lisa,Nancy Drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends. And I've got an inquisitive temperament! Maybe I could help solve this!
Lisa,Mr. Burns is the richest man in town. Maybe it was about money.
Lisa,"Hey! I said that. My name is Lisa Simpson, and I made a chart of all the suspects in the Burns case. Look."
Lisa,"Mr. Burns hurt all these people financially: nightclub owner Moe Szyslak. His bar was closed because of Burns' negligence; liquor connoisseur Barney Gumble. When Moe's closed, Barney lost his only means of support -- sucking coins out of the Love Tester machine."
Lisa,Dedicated educator Principal Seymour Skinner. His school lost millions when Burns pirated its oil well; and grounds-tender Groundskeeper Willie. He lost his job and his dream of owning a fine crystal slop bucket.
Lisa,Tito Puente?
Lisa,"Well, he did vow revenge. But I can't see him doing something illegal -- he's in show business! He's a celebrit--"
Lisa,Chief Wig-gum... Don't eat... the clues.
Lisa,This suit burns better. Look.
Lisa,Better... look... burns... suit.
Lisa,Burns' suit! Burns' suit!
Lisa,"Hey, Chief Wiggum, what are you doing? What's going on?"
Lisa,"They have Simpson D.N.A. It could've come from any of us. Except you, since you're a Bouvier."
Lisa,"Okay, Mom. Anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems. Like those fingerprints. They could've gotten on the gun some other way."
Lisa,Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones?
Lisa,And we don't even know whose gun that was. Maybe somebody planted it there to frame Dad.
Lisa,The scene of the crime! There must be something here that can clear Dad.
Lisa,"That's it! Oh, Mr. Pigeon, I'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease."
Lisa,"So, the D.N.A. was right. It must've been... Oh, Dad!"
Lisa,Stop! Don't shoot my Dad! He's innocent. He wouldn't hurt a fly!
Lisa,Then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to W and S.
Lisa,"Or from your point of view, M and S... Maggie Simpson."
Lisa,"Yeah, that's how fast Grampa is shrinking."
Lisa,"Cheer up, Bart. Milhouse is still gonna need a true friend. Someone to tell him he's great, someone to rub lotion on him, someone to hurl whiskey bottles at when he's feeling low."
Lisa,"Wow, Mom. You didn't have to go to this much trouble."
Lisa,"Mom, you fuss over us way too much."
Lisa,"Hey, c'mon! Those are prescription shoes! I need them!"
Lisa,No I don't!
Lisa,Ow! Mah tug!
Lisa,"Printhipal Thkinner, I need thum shoes."
Lisa,I don't know. They should be here.
Lisa,You don't understand. Mom and Dad take good care of us.
Lisa,That was a baby tooth... it was loose...
Lisa,"Yeah. It seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy Pat Boone-ish quality to it."
Lisa,"Well, when was the last time Dad gave her that kind of attention?"
Lisa,"I thought I could ride this thing out, but everything's just too weird here."
Lisa,And they read Newsweek instead of nothing.
Lisa,Yeah. The sun is still out.
Lisa,"You know, Maggie hasn't been a Simpson as long as us. I think she's beginning to forget Mom and Dad."
Lisa,Or the way Dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips?
Lisa,They're ten feet away and we can't even talk to them. I wish I could tell them how much I miss them.
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,We give up.
Lisa,"Uh, actually, the... We were never baptized."
Lisa,You're gonna be Bart Flanders.
Lisa,"Let's see. Dirt... dirt... Well, there wasn't really much dirt."
Lisa,Oh boy! Really?
Lisa,Nooooo! It's dripping funny-smelling water all over me!
Lisa,Where'd you get five bucks? I want five bucks.
Lisa,What? How could you do that? Your soul is the most valuable part of you!
Lisa,"Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart, it's the symbol of everything fine inside us."
Lisa,"Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever. For five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years."
Lisa,Hmmm... Pablo Neruda said laughter is the language of the soul.
Lisa,I think we should do a test.
Lisa,Well?
Lisa,"That's creepy, Bart. I think you really did lose your soul."
Lisa,How're the Southwestern Pizza Fingers?
Lisa,"I would like to say grace. Lord, have mercy on my soul, and Mom's soul, and Dad's soul, and Maggie's soul, and let every soul in Christendom..."
Lisa,With the change in my piggy bank.
Lisa,Not in any of the ones you know about.
Lisa,"Happy to do it. But you know, Bart, some philosophers believe that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer, like you did last night."
Lisa,"We're going to Storytown Village, Grampa. It's an amusement park for babies."
Lisa,Awwww.
Lisa,Awwww.
Lisa,AWWWW.
Lisa,"Oh, you are so cute! Yes you are! You are! I just love you."
Lisa,I can't eat this. I can't eat a poor little lamb!
Lisa,What's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me?
Lisa,"No, I can't! I can't eat any of them!"
Lisa,No.
Lisa,NO!
Lisa,Dad... those all come from the same animal.
Lisa,"Oh, my family just doesn't understand my newfound vegetarianism."
Lisa,"Compared to them, the public schools are a haven of enlightenment."
Lisa,Why does it talk like a lamb?
Lisa,Ah... Miss Hoover? I don't think I can dissect an animal. I think it's wrong.
Lisa,"Ah, excuse me? Isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it?"
Lisa,Well I believe you're required to provide a vegetarian alternative.
Lisa,Do you remember when you lost your passion for this work?
Lisa,"I never realized before, but some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny."
Lisa,Come to Homer's BBBQ. The Extra B is for BYOBB.
Lisa,"Dad, can't you have some other kind of party? One where you don't serve meat?"
Lisa,Mom.
Lisa,It's tomato soup served ice cold!
Lisa,They can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe!
Lisa,Stop it! Stop it! Don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda?
Lisa,"Wait Dad! Good news, everyone! You don't have to eat meat. I made enough Gazpacho for all!"
Lisa,It's bad enough they're all eating meat. They don't have to rub it in my face.
Lisa,"Oh, then you must think I'm a monster."
Lisa,"I'm never ever apologizing because I was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room."
Lisa,"Bart, tell Dad I'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product."
Lisa,"Why don't you just eat him, Dad."
Lisa,That's it. I can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore. I am out of here.
Lisa,Yes. I'm gonna marry a carrot.
Lisa,The whole world wants me to eat meat. I can't fight it anymore.
Lisa,THERE! IS EVERYBODY HAPPY NOW?!
Lisa,Tofu?
Lisa,"But why, Apu?"
Lisa,That's cute.
Lisa,"Wow, a secret staircase? But what do you do if somebody wants a non-alcoholic beer?"
Lisa,"Oh, Apu! It's beautiful!"
Lisa,That's why I ran away from home.
Lisa,"Wow, Paul McCartney! I read about you in history class. But where's your wife, Linda?"
Lisa,"Apu, I'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is..."
Lisa,Ewwww.
Lisa,"When will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains, and cheese?"
Lisa,"You don't eat cheese, Apu?"
Lisa,"I guess I have been pretty hard on a lot of people. Especially my dad. Thanks, you guys."
Lisa,"Wow, that'd be great!"
Lisa,"Hi, Dad. Looking for me?"
Lisa,"Actually Dad, this time I was wrong..."
Lisa,...too.
Lisa,"While I was gone, I got some really good advice from Paul and Linda McCartney."
Lisa,"I still stand by my beliefs, but I can't defend what I did. I'm sorry I messed up your barbecue."
Lisa,"Hey, what's that in his footprint?"
Lisa,Hmmmmm.
Lisa,"If your advertising agency created all those giant characters, you must know how to stop them."
Lisa,Like that old woman who couldn't find the beef?
Lisa,But people can't help looking at them. They're wrecking the town.
Lisa,"Hey, Springfield! Are you suffering from the heartbreak of monsteritis? Then take a tip from Mr. Paul Anka..."
Lisa,GUARANTEE VOID IN TENNESSEE.
Lisa,It worked! They're all dead!
Lisa,"Don't make us poke your eyes out, Dad."
Lisa,"Oh my God! Bart, Groundskeeper Willie was in my nightmare, too! But he got me with hedge-clippers!"
Lisa,"Mom, Dad -- Martin died at school today!"
Lisa,"Bart, don't you realize what this means? The next time we fall asleep we could die!"
Lisa,"It's no use, Bart. We can't stay up forever."
Lisa,"Okay, but promise you won't be grouchy."
Lisa,"Bart, you're in trouble! Wake up!"
Lisa,"I'm not asleep, I'm just resting my eye-- uh oh."
Lisa,"Good-bye, Bart!"
Lisa,"You saved us, Maggie!"
Lisa,"I don't know, Bart. Something tells me Willie's still out there, and that he could come back any time in any form and kill us in ways we can't even imagine."
Lisa,"Sorry, dad. This is our spot."
Lisa,"Well, we're calling it now."
Lisa,"Um, I would also like to take your coat."
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"Well, where's my dad?"
Lisa,Sorry.
Lisa,Dad--
Lisa,I must protest. You're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.
Lisa,Have you told mom about this?
Lisa,Da-ad!
Lisa,Obesity is really unhealthy. Any doctor will tell you that.
Lisa,Neat!
Lisa,"Mom, were you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this?"
Lisa,I like school.
Lisa,I would if I could.
Lisa,Eww! Mo-om!
Lisa,This whole thing is really creepy. Are you sure you won't talk to dad?
Lisa,"Well, maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings. The longer he lives like this, the harder it'll be to go back."
Lisa,Dad?
Lisa,Umm... Mom just baked a cake.
Lisa,"Dad, what are you doing down there?"
Lisa,"Hey, leave my dad alone. Just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. He's a sweet man and he has real feelings."
Lisa,Shouldn't you be working?
Lisa,"Hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac."
Lisa,"I think it's ironic that Dad saved the day, while a slimmer man would have fallen to his death."
Lisa,"Hi, everybody."
Lisa,Mom! Dad! Bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue!
Lisa,"This is so weird. It's like something out of Dickens or ""Melrose Place."""
Lisa,"Oh, I just keep them out to bug Bart."
Lisa,"Me, too!"
Lisa,More like pre-school.
Lisa,"Me, too."
Lisa,"Oh, you didn't dumb it down! You said ""rapport!"""
Lisa,There. Now no one should be able to hear us.
Lisa,"All right, we don't need the dryer."
Lisa,"Just shut up and listen. There's something fishy about Grandma. Whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject. And just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house."
Lisa,"Mona Simpson, Mona Stevens, Martha Stewart, Penelope Olsen, Muddy Mae Suggins..."
Lisa,These are the calling cards of a con artist.
Lisa,"All right, then we'll call your husband: Grampa."
Lisa,How did you survive?
Lisa,"No, Dad, it's a rhetorical question."
Lisa,"Dad, do you even know what ""rhetorical"" means?"
Lisa,"You know, Gramma, I used to think maybe I was adopted. I couldn't understand how I fit into this family. Now that I met you, I suddenly make a lot of sense."
Lisa,"Gramma, have you ever thought about moving back to Springfield?"
Lisa,"Don't you remember, dad?"
Lisa,He framed Krusty. He tried to kill Aunt Selma. He rigged an election.
Lisa,Wow! / Air show! / Cool! /
Lisa,"I wanna meet the first female Stealth bomber pilot. During the Gulf War she destroyed seventy mosques and her name is Lisa, too!"
Lisa,Can I fly it?
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,Da-ad! Why aren't you looking?
Lisa,"Mom! Mom, you're stepping on my heels and knocking my shoes off!"
Lisa,"Bart, no!"
Lisa,"Thanks, Mom."
Lisa,Bart! Bart! What are you doing?! We've got to get out of here!
Lisa,"Ow! C'mon, Mom and Dad are waiting!"
Lisa,"Huh? Hurry up, Mom and Dad are probably worried sick."
Lisa,"High-toned voice. Bart, that's it. I know where Sideshow Bob is hiding."
Lisa,"When Bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal. And what makes your voice high?"
Lisa,Helium. Sideshow Bob is in the Duff Blimp!
Lisa,Don't you see? That would be taking the easy way out --
Lisa,He's getting away!
Lisa,Mom! I found Sideshow Bob's hide-out and I got a secret message to the police and I had a blimp fall on me and I was in an atomic blast but I'm okay now!
Lisa,"Goodnight, Mom."
Lisa,Here we go again!
Lisa,"I will, Mom."
Lisa,Bedbugs?
Lisa,I'll be Lisui... the devil-may-care rocket pilot.
Lisa,"...and you'll be Bartron, the evil robot from Mars, gone berserk."
Lisa,"Do I understand you correctly, Bartron? Do you wish me to release you from the helmet of evil thoughts with my enchanted space wand?"
Lisa,"I will do it, Bartron. Who knows what mysterious forces will be unleashed?"
Lisa,"Oh no. Inside, the evil Bartron is a horrible mutant boy."
Lisa,"We'll be safe here till Mom and Dad, the evil overlords gets home."
Lisa,Thanks.
Lisa,"Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and S. Waylon Smithers."
Lisa,"Hey, I thought Krusty was Jewish..."
Lisa,Christmas is a time when people of all religions come together to worship Jesus Christ.
Lisa,Hmm. That looks entertaining.
Lisa,I think I'm having chest pains.
Lisa,I wanna look at the pets and write things on the typewriters and see if the new dictionaries are in!
Lisa,"I admit I haven't known Mom as long as you have, but I know when she's really upset. Her heart won't just wipe clean like this bathroom counter-top. It absorbs everything that touches it, like this bathroom rug."
Lisa,"Goodnight, Mom."
Lisa,"Mom, this fake snow is making me dizzy!"
Lisa,Bart got a present early? Then I should get a present early! I want a present!
Lisa,This is the worst Christmas ever.
Lisa,We are not wieners!
Lisa,"Now you are the one who is ""it."""
Lisa,"Red, green, yellow, orange! I remember all of these!"
Lisa,"Actually this is one of the nine states where Mr. Bush claims residency, Dad. I wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood."
Lisa,"No, Grampa, don't!"
Lisa,"No, let's go to the Nature Company. They've got a TV assembled by Hopi Indians!"
Lisa,Who are they?
Lisa,"Hey, Mom! There's something in here!"
Lisa,"But it's marked down from $2,800!"
Lisa,"Oh, you look so sophisticated -- just like Mary Hart!"
Lisa,"C'mon, Mom, you never treat yourself to anything."
Lisa,Just buy it. You don't have to rationalize everything.
Lisa,Do I have to go? That country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social-climbers.
Lisa,The rich are different from you and me.
Lisa,I don't know what Mom's thinking. This whole country club scene is so decadent...
Lisa,"All these - spoiled - brats - and - their - smug, complacent parents. It just reinforces...the unspoken - class - system - of... horses - sitting - on - their - high... horses I'm sorry. I gotta go!"
Lisa,"Mom, look! I found something more fun than complaining!"
Lisa,"Mom, did you like horses when you were my age? 'Cause I heard--"
Lisa,"Mom, do you want to know the fifteen reasons I like horses better than cars? One: a horse never--"
Lisa,You know how a horse goes like this? Mom? Like this? Mom?
Lisa,Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!
Lisa,"Yeah, you look great! You can do anything with that sewing machine."
Lisa,You mean it's a new dress? Where did you get it?
Lisa,"Wow, two finds in one store! What are the odds?"
Lisa,How much did it cost?
Lisa,With tax or without?
Lisa,"So with tax, how much was it?"
Lisa,"You look nice, is all."
Lisa,"I'm gonna ask people if they know their servants' last names, or, in the case of butlers, their first."
Lisa,I won't say anything controversial.
Lisa,It's okay. Those snobs never would've made us members anyway.
Lisa,Their tap water tasted better than ours!
Lisa,I'm going to contribute my money to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Lisa,Mom?
Lisa,I got their new Thrifty Saver Savings account. 2.3% annual interest instead of the normal 2.25. So a year from now I'll have an extra nickel.
Lisa,Thank you.
Lisa,"It is a tragedy for all us kids. But, Bart, you can't beat yourself up."
Lisa,You gotta hand it to Krusty.
Lisa,Oh my God! Krusty's shoes!
Lisa,"Bart, you're seeing Krusty everywhere because you want to tell him you're sorry for causing his death. Would it help if I told you you're not responsible for Krusty's death?"
Lisa,Well I can't. You'll just have to learn to live with your mental problem.
Lisa,"No. We're looking for this man, Krusty the Clown."
Lisa,"It's hopeless, Bart. We've searched up and down these docks, from Pier One to that Pier 1 by Pier Seventeen."
Lisa,"""Rory B. Bellows, Slip Eight!"" Let's go!"
Lisa,Hey! You've got a pacemaker scar just like Krusty!
Lisa,But we saw your plane crash...
Lisa,Or kill us.
Lisa,"Yeah, Krusty doesn't want to be a clown. He's happy just being another blue-collar bozo."
Lisa,What about that great feeling you get from knowing you're better than regular people?
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,How about town crier? You'd be great at that.
Lisa,"Hi, I'm Lisa Simpson. I'm here to research a report on Jebediah."
Lisa,"I was right about Jebediah, and now I can prove it."
Lisa,Wow!
Lisa,"The Secret Confessions of Jebediah Springfield? ""Know ye who read this: there is more to my life than history records."""
Lisa,"--ha ha ha ha ha. Oh my God! Our town hero is a fraud! ""I write this confession so that my infamy will live on long after my body has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria."""
Lisa,"Oh, it's just the excitement of studying Jebediah."
Lisa,Just when I was getting over my Chester A. Arthritis.
Lisa,"Uh, no."
Lisa,What would you say if I told you Jebediah Springfield wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be? Look.
Lisa,Jebediah was really a vicious pirate named Hans Sprüngfeld. His tongue was bitten off by a Turk in a grog house fight!
Lisa,He had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
Lisa,He was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. He even tried to kill George Washington!
Lisa,"The next time Hans Sprüngfeld was seen, he had changed his name to Jebediah Springfield."
Lisa,You do?
Lisa,"Aw, thanks, Dad."
Lisa,But it's all true!
Lisa,Miss Hoover thought I made the whole thing up. She called me a P.C. thug.
Lisa,"That won't help, Dad. No one's ever going to believe me."
Lisa,We could?
Lisa,No baseball bat.
Lisa,"Hi, Mr. Hurlbut."
Lisa,That's Jebediah's secret confession. It proves he was a fraud.
Lisa,But it explains why there's no record of Jebediah before 1795! He was Hans Sprüngfeld until then!
Lisa,I'm not going to give up. I refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth.
Lisa,"I'd like 25 copies on goldenrod, 25 on canary, 25 on saffron, and 25 on paella."
Lisa,"You don't have to help me with this, Dad."
Lisa,"Hi, Apu. Can I put this poster in your window?"
Lisa,He wouldn't let me put it up.
Lisa,"Jebediah Springfield was nothing more than an evil, blood-thirsty pirate who hated this town!"
Lisa,That's a myth that got mixed up with the truth.
Lisa,I hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration for a murderous pirate!
Lisa,"There is one way: get the silver tongue. If Jebediah's who I say he is, then it should still be in his grave."
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,"Don't forget to look in his shoes. When I lose something, sometimes it turns up in my shoes."
Lisa,I was so sure...
Lisa,"Oh, Dad, I'm really sorry. I know how much you wanted to be in the parade."
Lisa,I-I-I...
Lisa,General Washington?!
Lisa,"But I've caused so much trouble already, General Washington. I can't go on."
Lisa,No! Not Janey! She'll pack the Supreme Court with boys!
Lisa,"Oh, let me help you, George Washington, I still want to help you."
Lisa,The missing piece of the puzzle... I've got it!
Lisa,That's because you stole it!
Lisa,"But when you found the truth, you couldn't take it! You couldn't stand that you'd devoted your life to a fraud! So you covered it up! Didn't you? Didn't you?!"
Lisa,Stop it! Where's the silver tongue?!
Lisa,You did. Until I realized that Jebediah's confession was saying more than he meant it to.
Lisa,How else could he have gotten this?
Lisa,Exactly.
Lisa,"People of Springfield, I, uh, I don't know quite how to say this..."
Lisa,I did a lot of research on Jebediah Springfield and...
Lisa,"Jebediah Springfield was... Jebediah was... great. I, um, just wanted to say that I've done some research and, uh, he was great."
Lisa,"Because the myth of Jebediah has value, too. It's brought out the best in everyone in this town. Regardless of who said it, ""a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man."""
Lisa,"You know, Dad, assisting Mr. Burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
Lisa,Mo-omm! I just said that!
Lisa,"Bart, leave Simpson alone."
Lisa,Simpson! I need a ride to the library.
Lisa,"What happened, Dad?"
Lisa,Are you sure he's dead? Maybe you just really really hurt him.
Lisa,"Don't worry, Dad. Mr. Smithers is a resilient man. I'm sure he can get a great job at any corporation he wants."
Lisa,Did he die?
Lisa,Will do.
Lisa,"Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad."
Lisa,We've got to get seats for the Itchy and Scratchy parade.
Lisa,"Hey, the comic book store's still open!"
Lisa,"Mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the basement. And Dad's upstairs."
Lisa,It's one of those campy 70's throwbacks that appeals to Generation X'ers.
Lisa,So it's true. Some cartoons do encourage violence.
Lisa,And soon.
Lisa,The judge says it's okay as long as you pay Mr. Lampwick royalties.
Lisa,You'll get more royalties.
Lisa,"Yes, but..."
Lisa,I give up. There's nothing we can do.
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,"Yes, well, technically everything worked out all right. But..."
Lisa,"You're right, Mom. I'm sure if we put our minds to it we can solve this one too."
Lisa,Bart! Look at this!
Lisa,I don't know. But it looks like you might have a little competition all of a sudden.
Lisa,I don't understand it. We're always the ones who solve these problems.
Lisa,"Dad, what's a ""muppet?"""
Lisa,"Hi. I remember you from such film strips as ""Locker Room Towel Fight: The Blinding of Larry Driscoll."""
Lisa,Ah-huh.
Lisa,Santa?
Lisa,I still don't understand why you get to stay home and watch Mom work.
Lisa,I've signed numerous petitions to shut down that plant.
Lisa,Bart can take my place at the plant!
Lisa,"Well, how about Aunt Patty and Aunt Selma at the D.M.V.?"
Lisa,"No, thanks. Do you have any fruit?"
Lisa,Why are there so many burnt-out ones?
Lisa,Maybe we can make your job more fun... What are those?
Lisa,"Well, what if we used our imaginations...?"
Lisa,"Houston, we have a problem. Homer 13 is spinning out of control!"
Lisa,I'm going after him!
Lisa,It's not fair! I'm the best student in school. How come I never heard about this competition?
Lisa,"That's not Latin. Mom, Bart's faking it."
Lisa,I'm learning about owls.
Lisa,Sure I would! I can always learn about owls this summer at Bird Camp.
Lisa,Security guards?
Lisa,Sure!
Lisa,Why do you need me?
Lisa,Ready!
Lisa,Woo hoo!
Lisa,"Zagnut bar, Mr. Smithers? Razzles? Skittles? Whatchamacallit? Twizzlers?"
Lisa,We could have a slumber party.
Lisa,ThanksMombye!
Lisa,Okay. Time for truth or dare. You go first.
Lisa,"Who do you love most: me, Bart, or Maggie?"
Lisa,Okay... Why don't you...
Lisa,Hmmm... Truth.
Lisa,Da-ad!
Lisa,"Dad, you tell everybody everything. Even Moe knew when I threw up on the dentist."
Lisa,Okay. I like...
Lisa,Langdon Alger.
Lisa,Nobody does! He's very quiet and enjoys puzzles. But that still doesn't mean you can tell anyone!
Lisa,"Thanks, Dad. Oh, this has been the best Spring Break ever!"
Lisa,"So how's the National Grammar Rodeo, Bart?"
Lisa,"I knew it! I knew it because why would they have our National Grammar Rodeo in another nation?! Oh, Bart, you're going to be in sooo much trouble when--"
Lisa,"Hmm... You could travel for free if you were a stewardess. Well, how badly do you want to get home? All right, all right, how about a courier? They travel for free, too. No, that's a terrier. They're dogs."
Lisa,"But Bart, that'll cost a fortune."
Lisa,Whee.
Lisa,"There's something troubling me, Dad...but I don't think I can tell you because it's a secret."
Lisa,"Langdon Alger? Oh, I don't like him anymore... Okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially Bart."
Lisa,"Bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin to a wig outlet in Knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and Bart's working as a courier and just came back from Hong Kong."
Lisa,"No, no! Then he'll know I told! Dad, you said I could trust you."
Lisa,"It's in Tennessee, right next to the Oak Ridge Nuclear Facility, birthplace of the atomic bomb."
Lisa,...and Bart could be the courier!
Lisa,"No! Don't use your real name, or Bart will know!"
Lisa,"Mom, Dad threw his beer can at the Miracle Gro guy on TV. Can I recycle it?"
Lisa,Waaa! Uhh! There's gum in my hair!
Lisa,Mo-om! Someone threw gum in my hair!
Lisa,"No, it's somebody's gross gum! Get it out! Ow! Ow! It's pulling out my hairs!"
Lisa,Why me? Yuk! I smell like a sandwich.
Lisa,Gaaah!
Lisa,"No, I've got gum in my hair!"
Lisa,My scalp hurts from horsefly bites.
Lisa,That sounds okay...
Lisa,Ah! Ah! Ah! Stop! Stop!
Lisa,Does the whole town have to hear about this?
Lisa,"Cut it off, but be careful."
Lisa,I love it! I finally look like a real person! Thanks!
Lisa,He's down there.
Lisa,You already put him in a home.
Lisa,No! Old people deserve our respect! Look at Jacques Cousteau and Goldie Hawn. You wouldn't shut them away like second-class citizens.
Lisa,"Uh, Grampa, maybe I should moisten your washcloth..."
Lisa,"Wow, he's even more agitated than usual. Maybe we should let him stay."
Lisa,Bart's room.
Lisa,"That's specious reasoning, Dad."
Lisa,"By your logic, I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away."
Lisa,It doesn't work.
Lisa,It's just a stupid rock.
Lisa,"But I don't see any tigers around here, do you?"
Lisa,"Actually, Dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history."
Lisa,That's the Home-Owner Tax.
Lisa,"I don't see how you can support Proposition 24, Dad."
Lisa,"But immigration is what America's all about. Even the Simpson family immigrated to America. Right, Grampa?"
Lisa,"Mom, you're the greatest. Can I have this licorice?"
Lisa,There was an amnesty declared for people who've been here as long as you! That means you can take the citizenship test!
Lisa,"All right! Now you've got all the Simpsons behind you, Apu!"
Lisa,That's it!
Lisa,"No, not what he said -- what he is. Grandfather. As in ""grandfather clause"". Apu, how long ago did your visa expire?"
Lisa,"Da-ad! You're not pointing anywhere near Springfield. It's over here, Apu."
Lisa,Perfect. Let's roll.
Lisa,"You know, Apu, in a way, all Americans are immigrants -- except Native Americans."
Lisa,"No, I mean American Indians."
Lisa,"No, I mean--"
Lisa,"Dad? Please just drive the car, Dad."
Lisa,"Bart, no!"
Lisa,"Dad, you forgot to pick up Milhouse!"
Lisa,What are you talking about?
Lisa,"Bart, these look real."
Lisa,"Wow, it's like Woodstock. Only with advertisements everywhere and tons of security guards."
Lisa,"Generation X may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people."
Lisa,It smells like Otto's jacket.
Lisa,Wearing a Jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music.
Lisa,"It may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd."
Lisa,"Dad, are you okay?"
Lisa,"Shh, Mom. Dad needs our support."
Lisa,That song is so lame.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,How else would you know?
Lisa,The reward for a year's worth of toil and sacrifice: Retrospecticus.
Lisa,Oops.
Lisa,"You know something, BeeZee? I think you're right."
Lisa,"In the beginning of the school year, each of you received a colored ticket. I hope everyone still has theirs."
Lisa,"Mr. Estes, the publications advisor. I edited the whole thing."
Lisa,"Hey, will you guys sign my yearbook?"
Lisa,Wha?
Lisa,"I don't get it. Straight A's, perfect attendance, Bathroom Timer... I should be the most popular girl in school."
Lisa,"Heyyy, great, a friend... or a companion... ... stuffed animal..."
Lisa,Friends? Hah! These are my only friends...
Lisa,Grown-up nerds like Gore Vidal. And even he's kissed more boys than I ever will.
Lisa,"Mom, why don't I have any friends?"
Lisa,"We are best friends, Mom. But I'm a kid. I need friends my own age, too."
Lisa,Be myself? I've been myself for eight years and it hasn't worked. Look at all these dorky clothes... A bathing cap... nose plugs...
Lisa,"A microscope at the beach -- ugh, what was I thinking?"
Lisa,Maybe you're getting stronger.
Lisa,Bye-bye Lisa Simpson.
Lisa,It must be exciting to make a different set of beds.
Lisa,"Well, it's kind of funny... with all the craziness and confusion and mishegoss of packing... Ha... I forgot to pack."
Lisa,Exactly.
Lisa,"Uh, Mom, I'm kinda trying to go for a different look this year."
Lisa,"Mom, come here. Bring money."
Lisa,"Um, if it's okay with you, Mom, I'd rather go find some kids."
Lisa,I wonder where all the kids are.
Lisa,"Hey, a library! No, I can't. That's the old nerdy Lisa."
Lisa,I don't see any kids at all. It's like they ditched me in advance.
Lisa,Only kids are that incoherent!
Lisa,"Like, you know, whatever. Like, you know, whatever."
Lisa,"Hey, what's hap--"
Lisa,"Okay, okay, okay... not your fault, it's a bird thing. You don't control the birds -- you will someday, but not now."
Lisa,Hi.
Lisa,A compliment!
Lisa,Thanks. Umm... You guys skate?
Lisa,I think I know a place you can skate that's virtually deserted.
Lisa,"Like, you know, whatever."
Lisa,Didn't. It's Lisa.
Lisa,Me? Unlikely. My goony brother's always going to libraries. I usually hang out in front.
Lisa,"Well, it beats doing stuff."
Lisa,"Okay... thanks. That's very, uh... ""rad"" of you."
Lisa,"That's my dorky little brother, Bart --tholomew."
Lisa,"That's a hermit crab. When she outgrows her old shell, she finds a new one that's a better fit."
Lisa,"Don't be afraid, little friend. You'll be the most popular crab on the beach."
Lisa,"Aww, a gift from my favorite crustacean."
Lisa,"No. No, I heard it on ""Baywatch."""
Lisa,"Well, we could do something fun. Um, how 'bout a beach party?"
Lisa,"Don't have a cow, man!"
Lisa,Aye carumba!
Lisa,"For me? Wow, my first real friend... ...ship bracelet. I don't have anything for you... ...except this necklace I made."
Lisa,I just know we're gonna be friends forever.
Lisa,What's he doing here?
Lisa,My yearbook! No!
Lisa,"I know exactly who I am. I am the sister of a rotten, jealous, mean little sneak."
Lisa,You cost me my only friends! You ruined my life!
Lisa,Being myself didn't work... Being someone else didn't work... Maybe I just wasn't meant to have friends.
Lisa,"Okay, you found out I'm an over-achieving bookworm. So whatever mean prank you're pulling, just finish it up and send me a Polaroid. I'm going to sleep."
Lisa,Does this mean you still want to be friends? Even though I tried to cover up my nerdish... leanings?
Lisa,"Ohmigod, Bart, look!"
Lisa,This is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever --
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,"Oh. Thanks, Bart."
Lisa,Uh huh.
Lisa,"Did you hear that, Bart?"
Lisa,No. She's sleeping with
Lisa,me.
Lisa,What's up there? / Is it a monster? / We have to know! / What's the secret?
Lisa,Hurry up! Mom and Dad'll be home soon!
Lisa,"Bart, do you think it's safe?"
Lisa,MomDadWeSawSomethingInTheAtticAnd --
Lisa,So I have two brothers?
Lisa,"I believe they prefer to be called ""conjoined twins."""
Lisa,I'll start with Radio Shack.
Lisa,"Mom, Hugo's eating his napkin!"
Lisa,This tooth will be perfect for my science project.
Lisa,"Science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and Chinese food. But I can still ruin soft drinks for everyone."
Lisa,Ow! What's that supposed to prove?
Lisa,Ow!
Lisa,Ow! Stupid Bart!
Lisa,Oh boy! Mold! That's science-fair paydirt!
Lisa,Hmmm. Looks about the same.
Lisa,Ah.
Lisa,Tiny little people!
Lisa,My God. I've created life!
Lisa,"Ooo, waffles!"
Lisa,"Hey, these aren't waffles -- these are just square pancakes!"
Lisa,That waffle iron's been in the shop forever.
Lisa,"So, how are my little stone age tub dwellers? Oh my gosh!"
Lisa,They're evolving so quickly! They've already reached the Renaissance... Wait! One of them is nailing something to the door of the cathedral! I've created Lutherans!
Lisa,"Wow, it's almost like seeing into the future!"
Lisa,Ba-rt stop it!
Lisa,"Oh, my poor little guys. That Bart is so rude."
Lisa,"Well, you practically destroyed their whole world!"
Lisa,Your world is incredible! And you speak English!
Lisa,You think I'm God?
Lisa,The devil? What devil?
Lisa,"Oh, no-no-no-no, you don't understand. Bart's just my brother."
Lisa,"Listen, I can take care of everything. All you have to do is unshrink me."
Lisa,"Bart, noooo!"
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, wait! I created the universe! Give me the gift certificate!"
Lisa,"Oh, great. I'm stuck in this lousy tub for the rest of my life."
Lisa,Shouldn't you people be groveling? And bring me some shoes. Nice ones!
Lisa,"I'm sorry, Dad. I just find that very cute."
Lisa,Yeah. Did you notice how the people weren't shoving or knocking each other down? I've never been to a place like that before.
Lisa,Yayyy!
Lisa,It says here one of these giant redwood trees can provide enough sawdust to cover an entire day's worth of vomit at Disneyland.
Lisa,Oooh! Aaah! Ohhh!
Lisa,Oooh!
Lisa,Wildflowers! We don't have you in Springfield!
Lisa,"Hello, Mr. Chipmunk! You're a Northern Reticulated Chipmunk! Yes, you are! You are so reticulated!"
Lisa,"Hi, Mrs. Owl! You're out kind of early!"
Lisa,Oh! The whole forest is blooming!
Lisa,Excuse me.
Lisa,"Oh, my eyes are burning!"
Lisa,"Oh, little chipmunk friend. I'm allergic to everything!"
Lisa,"I'm allergic to everything here. My nose is so stuffed up, I can't even taste Mom's delicious boiled celery."
Lisa,That's an electric nostril groomer.
Lisa,"Mom's right, Dad. The odds against you winning are a thousand to one."
Lisa,Those are the odds they're giving in Vegas.
Lisa,What are you talking about?
Lisa,No.
Lisa,What a perfect outing for a beautiful autumn day!
Lisa,"It's not foilage, Mom. It's foliage. Fo-li-age."
Lisa,He tried to kill our puppies.
Lisa,"He's not a drifter, Mom. That's Mr. Burns's son, Larry."
Lisa,"Hey, that reminds me, Mom -- Buckingham Palace called. They want their hat back."
Lisa,"Hey, I think I got a Pai Gow!"
Lisa,We've got to go down there and help Dad!
Lisa,Who's playing that music?
Lisa,"Da-ad! V-chip, V-chip!"
Lisa,"Oh, no!"
Lisa,"...And we'd be doing our part for the environment! Plus, we'd get to clean up all those cute animals."
Lisa,"Oh, Mom, please! You can make this my birthday and Christmas presents!"
Lisa,Yes I do! Sure I do! Look!
Lisa,I'm gonna rescue a baby seal! And then I'm gonna save an otter!
Lisa,You mean there's nothing left to clean?
Lisa,"Oh, there's something unsatisfying about scrubbing these rocks. And I think I know what it is..."
Lisa,"Faster, Mom, faster!"
Lisa,How was what? What?
Lisa,It's no time for school.
Lisa,"Mom, calm down. The party's not for another three hours."
Lisa,You're a grand old flag / You're a high flying flag / Etc...
Lisa,"Hi, Dad. You know, there's buns in the cabinet."
Lisa,"Oh, okay. Can I stay up?"
Lisa,You've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you. Why would she leave you now?
Lisa,You mean like your poker shack out in the swamp?
Lisa,She knows.
Lisa,You're very lucky to have Mom.
Lisa,"Who does Nelson think he's impressing, anyway, acting so cool all the time?"
Lisa,Why do you have to be such a pain all the time? Don't you realize you're getting a bad reputation?
Lisa,It does not!
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,"No, sir. I was laughing at something outside."
Lisa,"Oh, how does Bart do this every week?"
Lisa,It's your fault! I accidentally laughed at your immature prank.
Lisa,"Thanks, but I prefer the honest way."
Lisa,"Wow, that was a good idea. And I can't believe it came from Nelson."
Lisa,"Milhouse, I've never told anyone this kind of thing before... but I've never felt this way before. I think I have a crush..."
Lisa,...on Nelson Muntz.
Lisa,"But I bet underneath, he's a sweet, sensitive person -- like you. I guess you could say I want to bring out the Milhouse in Nelson."
Lisa,"I like you, too, Milhouse, but not in that way. You're more like a big sister."
Lisa,"Would you do me a favor? When you get back to class, just give him this note."
Lisa,Please?
Lisa,"Milhouse, I'm so sorry..."
Lisa,Nelson! Um... that note Milhouse gave you... it wasn't from him. It was from... me.
Lisa,I don't know why I like you. I just do. So... what do you think?
Lisa,Well... would you like to come over to my house after school?
Lisa,"Oh, you've got to see this, it's so cute what she does. Be the baby, kitty. Go on, be the baby."
Lisa,C'mon!
Lisa,Snowball! I - don't - understand. She loves to climb in h--
Lisa,"It's okay, I invited him over. Nelson's my new... friend."
Lisa,"Please don't ruin this for me, Bart. I think he's starting to like me!"
Lisa,"Oh, please. Milhouse likes Vaseline on toast."
Lisa,"""Nuke the whales?"" You don't really believe that, do you?"
Lisa,Touché.
Lisa,You play the guitar?
Lisa,Would you... play a song for me?
Lisa,I wish I could laugh at the idea of a teacher being decapitated.
Lisa,Hardly.
Lisa,How am I supposed to get home?
Lisa,"I feel so stupid, Mom. Nelson's not right for me at all. And I don't think he ever will be."
Lisa,What?
Lisa,Mom...
Lisa,"Oh, I know."
Lisa,I wonder if I could change Nelson...
Lisa,Very sharp!
Lisa,"I know it's a change, but it really highlights your sweet and sensitive side."
Lisa,"Isn't it nice up here? What are you thinking, Nelson?"
Lisa,About anything.
Lisa,What do you feel? What's inside you right now?
Lisa,"Come on, Nelson! You must think and feel things. I mean, look where we are: a rolling green hillside, the stars coming out like God is lighting a million tiny candles, the moon looking down on us as if to say..."
Lisa,"See, you do have a tender side. You just needed someone to bring it out."
Lisa,"Listen, you thugs, stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry!"
Lisa,You'll be so sorry when you realize how you've hurt the feelings of a sweet young man!
Lisa,He's not like you anymore! He's changed! And he doesn't want to hang around with a buncha crumb-bums!
Lisa,"You got rid of them! And you did it like a gentleman, without any violence."
Lisa,That's so unfair!
Lisa,Meet me at the back door!
Lisa,I think they're giving up.
Lisa,I thought you weren't there.
Lisa,You lied to me.
Lisa,"There, you did it again!"
Lisa,"No. You don't understand, Nelson. A kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest."
Lisa,I was foolish to think I'd actually changed you. Maybe I was seeing things in you that weren't really there.
Lisa,Then why did you want to be with me?
Lisa,"Well, I guess this is it..."
Lisa,"Let's just call it ""Smell ya later."""
Lisa,Don't worry. Nelson and I don't like each other anymore.
Lisa,"Well, I'm really not thinking about that now."
Lisa,I suppose it could be almost anybody...
Lisa,"Hmm, pressure dropping, humidity rising over eighty percent, increasing wind..."
Lisa,"Here we are, Chapter Two: ""So Your Pressure Is Dropping."" --"
Lisa,"Dad, wake up!"
Lisa,I think a hurricane is coming!
Lisa,"Yes, but the records only go back to 1978, when the Hall of Records was mysteriously blown away!"
Lisa,We better pick up some supplies.
Lisa,"Okay, start with diagonal colors."
Lisa,"Mo-om, let's just grab what we can and get out of here. This storm is making people crazy."
Lisa,But I'm not fruit! I'm a kid!
Lisa,You've got to start backwards! / Orange to orange! Ignore the reds! / Alternate corners! /
Lisa,"Dad, no! This may just be the eye of the hurricane."
Lisa,"Wait. Listen, everybody!"
Lisa,The hurricane's over.
Lisa,"Mr. Flanders, with all due respect, Bart didn't do anything."
Lisa,Not me.
Lisa,I'm gonna go get some vegetarian chili before they get desperate and add meat.
Lisa,"I saw it, Bart."
Lisa,What hat?
Lisa,Out back.
Lisa,Either that or Batman has really let himself go.
Lisa,All right! It's time for ABC's TGIF lineup!
Lisa,Maybe you just dreamed it.
Lisa,"Dad, according to ""Junior Skeptic Magazine"" the chances are a hundred seventy-five million-to-one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours."
Lisa,"It's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs! Oh, and you, Dad. Heh heh..."
Lisa,"Santa's Little Helper, it's your birthday? We've got to get you a present! Yes we do! Yes we do!"
Lisa,I think there must be a more logical explanation. And I think the people of this town aren't gonna be won over by three seconds of videotape.
Lisa,Wait!
Lisa,You want an alien? This is your alien!
Lisa,"Mom, this is no time to be conservative. Let's roll the dice here."
Lisa,"Wow, Mom, look at all those customers!"
Lisa,"They're good pretzels, Mom. But you've got to think big. Find a major public event and set up shop there."
Lisa,"Oh, Mom, no!"
Lisa,What's going on outside?
Lisa,Yankees.
Lisa,Really? Let me see!
Lisa,"Hi, Mr. Smithers!"
Lisa,We'll help you.
Lisa,"Hi, Mom!"
Lisa,Mr. Smithers! Mr. Smithers! I found another hurt shrew! I think this one has a twisted ankle!
Lisa,Mr. Smithers! Mr. Smithers! That moose is on fire!
Lisa,What about our dad?!
Lisa,"Mom, Dad and Mr. Burns could be trapped in there!"
Lisa,Look! What's that?!!
Lisa,"I'll see what else is on. Hey, where's the remote?"
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"Uh, mom?"
Lisa,"Um, there's a hair in my soup. But I'll just eat around it."
Lisa,"Well, it's blue... six feet long..."
Lisa,Me too.
Lisa,We'll find a way. Mom has made so many sacrifices for us -- it's time we gave up something for her. I'll stop buying Malibu Stacey clothing.
Lisa,But he didn't do anything!
Lisa,We have our own suggestions for the new nanny. Would you like to hear them?
Lisa,"Maestro, if you please."
Lisa,IF YOU WISH TO BE OUR SITTER / PLEASE BE SWEET AND NEVER BITTER / HELP US WITH MATH AND BOOK REPORTS /
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,"IF MAGGIE'S FUSSY, DON'T AVOID HER."
Lisa,TEACH US SONGS AND MAGIC TRICKS.
Lisa,THE NANNY WE WANT IS KINDLY AND SAGE.
Lisa,"HURRY NANNY, THINGS ARE"
Lisa,GRIM--
Lisa,ANY-ONE BUT HIM.
Lisa,Do we have to?
Lisa,IT'S THE AMERICAN WAYYY!
Lisa,You know her?
Lisa,"Oh Shary Bobbins, this is ever so much fun!"
Lisa,But we're not sleepy.
Lisa,"Yes, sing us a song!"
Lisa,"More kippers, mum?"
Lisa,"We'll miss you, Shary Bobbins."
Lisa,Been there. Done it.
Lisa,Shh. TV.
Lisa,We've crushed her gentle spirit.
Lisa,Nope.
Lisa,I'M GETTING USED TO NEVER GETTING NOTICED.
Lisa,Good-bye Shary Bobbins!
Lisa,Do you think we'll ever see her again?
Lisa,"Sure, we love it! But how can we watch TV when it's so beautiful out?"
Lisa,Ok. / Guess so. / Sounds good to me./ Let's go.
Lisa,Wow! / Alright! / Cool!
Lisa,Why is that mirror sneezing?
Lisa,Me! / I would! /
Lisa,Me! / I would! /
Lisa,"Um, excuse me, sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the Itchy and Scratchy show -- it's as good as ever. But after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had."
Lisa,Adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.
Lisa,"You should try out, Dad. You have a funny voice."
Lisa,"No, it's not your fault, dad. You did fine. It's just that Poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. You can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords."
Lisa,Yes. Terrible.
Lisa,I guess...
Lisa,We should thank our lucky stars they're still putting out a program of this caliber after so many years.
Lisa,"Aw, Mom, are you sure you want to sell a family heirloom to pay the gas bill? I mean, what would your Grandma say?"
Lisa,"Wow! An actual robot from the movie ""Clank! Clank! You're Dead!"""
Lisa,Ech! Think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside...
Lisa,Please don't construe our ownership of this as an endorsement of slavery.
Lisa,Hi-C! And Fluffernutters!
Lisa,"Mom, John likes ""Itchy and Scratchy"" as much as we do -- maybe more!"
Lisa,I never realized how many celebrities humiliated themselves right in our own backyard!
Lisa,"But, Dad, it's barbaric! How does killing a deer make you more of a man?"
Lisa,No. They were just going to find a deer and make Bart shoot it.
Lisa,"But if there're no deer out there, then what are they hunting?"
Lisa,Where are the dice?
Lisa,"This is about as tolerant as Dad gets, so you should be flattered."
Lisa,He thinks you're gay.
Lisa,And vice versa.
Lisa,"Hey, you said we were going to Dairy Queen."
Lisa,"I know it's hard to accept, Bart, but face it: Sideshow Bob has changed."
Lisa,Bob's trailer at the construction site?
Lisa,What were you thinking?
Lisa,"If I didn't know better, I'd swear Bob was building a dam."
Lisa,"Bart, there must be millions of dollars there!"
Lisa,Run!
Lisa,Then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it.
Lisa,You cut back on building materials and kept all the money for yourself! That's what happened.
Lisa,But everyone will know you did this!
Lisa,"It's hopeless. Utterly, utterly hopeless."
Lisa,No!
Lisa,"Um, do you know what you're doing?"
Lisa,"Bob, look!"
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,"No, Chief, Bob's innocent! It's the truth!"
Lisa,"I love everything about the world of babysitting: the responsibility, the obligation, the pressure..."
Lisa,"That's a trust, Janey. A sacred trust."
Lisa,Why hasn't anyone called?
Lisa,But... but I'm very mature for my age. People often mistake me for nine.
Lisa,I'll do it! I'll babysit!
Lisa,"But I'm smart and responsible, and my parents will be right next door!"
Lisa,"Please, please, please!"
Lisa,Don't worry. A moth is no more harmful than a ladybug.
Lisa,"Oh, they're going to get eaten alive in middle school."
Lisa,Once there was a robot named Todd...
Lisa,"Yes, he had a brother robot named Rod, who was two space-years older than him."
Lisa,"Okay, Chief. Enjoy Bob Saget!"
Lisa,Now put your left leg into the left side of the pants -- and you're done.
Lisa,Thanks for the ride!
Lisa,"Thank you, Dr. Hibbert. Your trust means so much to me."
Lisa,"There's a lot more to it than that, Bart. I don't just babysit; I sell peace of mind for a dollar an hour -- two dollars after nine o'clock."
Lisa,"You look so glamorous, Mom! Oh, and you smell like vanilla flowers!"
Lisa,It'll be dark.
Lisa,"Bart, I know you're not wild about having me for a babysitter, but I'm not some ogre. I think you will find me fair and fun."
Lisa,"You should wash up for dinner. To make it fun, you can use the Mr. Bubble -- it'll be like giving your fingers a bubble bath!"
Lisa,Certainly.
Lisa,Certainly.
Lisa,"Uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have."
Lisa,"Bart, if you don't want to have a babysitter, maybe you should stop being such a baby."
Lisa,Even babies know how to open and close their mouths. You need a bib.
Lisa,"Oh, look, Bart, now you got Maggie all upset!"
Lisa,"Bart, that's coffee ice cream! It has caffeine in it!"
Lisa,"Mag-gie, if you come down, I'll give you some more cof-fee."
Lisa,"Lots more coffee. Are you getting ready for bed, Bart?"
Lisa,"Come on, Maggie... Good Maggie... The talcum powder's not to play with..."
Lisa,"Okay, Bart, now it's really time for you to go to bed!"
Lisa,Why do you have to make this so hard?
Lisa,Uch! The idea that you would compare yourself to Mahatma Gandhi...
Lisa,I'll answer it. You go to bed!
Lisa,What? I didn't order any giant sub!
Lisa,Excuse me?
Lisa,"Well, there's been a mistake."
Lisa,I didn't see any U.F.O.!
Lisa,"Well, he's not here! Nobody's here! And none of you should be here! You've all been tricked!"
Lisa,"Bart, you are going to be in so much trouble when Mom and Dad get home. Now go to bed!"
Lisa,I thought I told you to go to bed!
Lisa,"I said go to ""bed."""
Lisa,B-E-D -- BED!
Lisa,GO TO YOUR BED!
Lisa,I'll make you!
Lisa,Ba-art!
Lisa,Oh my God!
Lisa,"Bart, are you okay?!"
Lisa,"Ew, your arm! It's got extra corners!"
Lisa,We have to get you to the emergency room!
Lisa,Stop it! Stand still! Maybe I can pop it back in.
Lisa,Bart! You need first aid! Let me in!
Lisa,"Bart, if you come out, I'll let you eat raw cookie dough. I'll let you... ride the lawn mower through the house. Come on, open the door!"
Lisa,What are you doing now?!
Lisa,"No! As your babysitter, I order you to stop hitting your head on the wall!"
Lisa,"Bart? Did you stop because I said to? If so, thank you."
Lisa,Bart?
Lisa,911
Lisa,"Hello, this is Lisa Simpson, and..."
Lisa,Wait! Dr. Hibbert!
Lisa,"Well, I guess I don't have a choice..."
Lisa,Complete confidentiality? Oh. And I'm sure he's as good as Dr. Hibbert. It says so right in his ad.
Lisa,"Hold on, Bart. Everything's going to be just fine. I'm going to get you to a doctor. He will fix you up, and by this time tomorrow we'll all be a happy family. Happy, happy, happy family."
Lisa,Mag-gie!
Lisa,"Please, Maggie, please go to sleep!"
Lisa,"Um, excuse me, Mr. Smithers, Bart may be seriously hurt. Could we possibly go ahead of you?"
Lisa,Hi. How are you?
Lisa,Okay...
Lisa,Oh God! Where's Bart?!
Lisa,"Oh, Bart, I'm so sorry. This is all like a bad dream..."
Lisa,"Oh, what's happening? Where am I?"
Lisa,"Dad, I'm not on drugs. I was just trying--"
Lisa,"Hey, Bart. How's your arm?"
Lisa,"Eh, well, that's okay. I can always sell seeds. Do you want some seeds?"
Lisa,"Hello, world's worst babysitter speaking."
Lisa,Aren't you afraid I might take drugs and injure your children?
Lisa,"Oh, um, I'm sorry. Can you hold on, please... Hello?"
Lisa,Didn't you hear I almost killed my brother?
Lisa,That's funny. I don't feel stupid.
Lisa,No one's pinching his legs.
Lisa,Mo-om!
Lisa,"Mo-om!! Prohibition may be unpopular, but it's the law and we still have to--"
Lisa,Now you're making your own alcohol? That's even more illegal than what you were doing before!
Lisa,But 7 goes into 28 4 times.
Lisa,"Bart, how come you're not sick?"
Lisa,I didn't. I just wanted to leave.
Lisa,"I was in the library at the time, but Janey told me that Principal Skinner and Bart's teacher, Mrs.... What's her name?"
Lisa,"Yeah, Krabappel. They were naked in the closet together."
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"Oh, Foreign Language Institute. Oh, my German verb wheel!"
Lisa,Ich esse; er isst; wir essen.
Lisa,"Wow, ""Trucker's Choice."" That is so sweet."
Lisa,Halogen lamps? Kilim rugs? You can't afford this how can you afford this?
Lisa,"And so handsome! Bart, I just love him!"
Lisa,"In a truth-telling contest. Right, Bart?"
Lisa,"What've you got for me, boy? Hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil to ensure a glossy coat."
Lisa,"No. They went for a walk with the Flanders. Bart, what's going on? Why are these repo guys taking all your stuff?"
Lisa,"A credit card? Oh, I knew you were up to no good."
Lisa,"Hey! Stop! You can take back the bassinet, but the baby is ours!"
Lisa,Where's Santa's Little Helper?
Lisa,Let's all walk Laddie.
Lisa,"Hey, this park is great! How come we never take Santa's Little Helper here?"
Lisa,"Bart, that is a new low."
Lisa,"Well, I won't tell Mom and Dad, but only because I want the dog back. Just try not to freak out the blind man."
Lisa,"Oh, it's for my Junior Achievers Club. We're trying to earn money by recycling."
Lisa,"Mom, Mom, you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane!"
Lisa,And you have to cut these up first. Otherwise animals get caught in them.
Lisa,I could still use more paper.
Lisa,Dad! You're not supposed to have fun recycling. This is serious.
Lisa,"Yes. Um, does your plant have a recycling program?"
Lisa,Hmm. You've never heard of recycling? It means to reuse things to conserve our natural resources.
Lisa,But nature's not our enemy.
Lisa,No! I don't agree!
Lisa,"But according to your most recent biography, you only have one hundred million dollars today."
Lisa,But we didn't do that badly. We collected enough paper to save one whole tree.
Lisa,"I normally don't laugh at other people's misfortunes, but on behalf of the recycling community: HA! It couldn't happen to anyone more deserving."
Lisa,"Dad, if you just drink one more, I'll have a full bag."
Lisa,There's got to be more trash around here somewhere...
Lisa,"Thanks, Dad!"
Lisa,"What do you mean you don't have anything to recycle? You must have some magazines, or newspapers."
Lisa,"My name is Lisa, Mr. Burns. Lisa Simpson."
Lisa,Ha! I'd never help you. You're the worst man in the world.
Lisa,"No, I'm not!"
Lisa,No.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,You again.
Lisa,"Oh... if I did agree to help you, you could only earn money by doing good, socially responsible things. Nothing evil."
Lisa,"Not good money, really. Each can'll get you a nickel."
Lisa,There's a can.
Lisa,You have to cut these six-pack holders up. Otherwise fish get trapped in them.
Lisa,"Oh, I'm not doing this for the money. I'm just happy knowing that future generations will enjoy unspoiled median strips and pristine highway embankments."
Lisa,You guys shouldn't laugh at him. Mr. Burns has changed. He's different now.
Lisa,"Mr. Burns, if you want people to do a good job, you can't bully them. You have to show them they're appreciated."
Lisa,"Wow, even I didn't know he was so committed to recycling! See? I told you Mr. Burns has changed. See?"
Lisa,I'd love to -- Partner!
Lisa,"I'm so proud of you, Mr. Burns! You're getting your fortune back and you're doing it without endangering the planet or cozying up to the Aspen crowd."
Lisa,What's going on?
Lisa,"Oh, dear God!"
Lisa,I think I'm going to be sick...
Lisa,"Ach! You haven't changed at all! You're still evil! And when you're trying to be good, you're even more evil!"
Lisa,Stop! Don't recycle! It's murder! You're helping Mr. Burns!
Lisa,No! It's evil! Please stop recycling!
Lisa,"Oh, I can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! I was a fool to help that horrible old man!"
Lisa,"I don't want to talk to you, Mr. Burns."
Lisa,Congratulations...
Lisa,"Wow! I've never seen so much money! Oh, but I can't accept that, knowing where it came from. Can I, Mom?"
Lisa,"I'm sorry, Dad."
Lisa,"Um, Dad... ten percent of 120 million dollars isn't twelve thousand. It's..."
Lisa,"/ Yahoo! / Oh, man, am I glad to get outta there! / etc."
Lisa,It's the longest possible time before more church.
Lisa,Me! Me!
Lisa,I found a Malibu Stacy with no head!
Lisa,What the heck is that?
Lisa,It looks Japanese.
Lisa,What's he saying?
Lisa,Wow.
Lisa,"Look, we got a package from the Mr. Sparkle Company in Japan!"
Lisa,It's a videotape!
Lisa,"Wait, look."
Lisa,"Hey, it was all a coincidence!"
Lisa,Did you see that?
Lisa,Ned! Ned! Mr. Flanders!
Lisa,"That came from Baboon County, U.S.A.!"
Lisa,Play dead!
Lisa,"Look, it's Reverend Lovejoy!"
Lisa,"Oh, those poor monkeys."
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,Hi.
Lisa,Can I go downstairs and see what Dad's doing?
Lisa,"Chief Wiggum, I can't wait to hear about all the exciting, sexy adventures you're sure to have against this colorful backdrop!"
Lisa,"Oh, Miss Hoover, movies are a nice break, but couldn't we be doing something a little more challenging?"
Lisa,Where's Miss Hoover?
Lisa,"It's not my nature to complain, but so far today we've had three movies, two film strips, and an hour and a half of ""magazine time."" I just don't feel challenged."
Lisa,When do you expect the ringing will stop?!
Lisa,Look at how disciplined they are. They're just like the Terra Cotta Warriors of Xian.
Lisa,They're discussing poetry! Oh! We never do that at my school!
Lisa,And so am I!
Lisa,This school has everything I ever wanted.
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,All I want is a chance to prove myself.
Lisa,Sorry. Sorry. I know we'll be friends. Talk about getting off on the wrong foot... heh heh.
Lisa,Is there any answer I can give that won't result in more push-ups?
Lisa,"Hey, look, it's the school motto."
Lisa,Apparently Tim was someone who was with the general moments before he was shot right in the head.
Lisa,"That's how they want you to feel. But if you just hang in there, they'll eventually accept you."
Lisa,"Hey, what about me? I'm a lowly maggot!"
Lisa,"Could someone help me? It's stuck on ""Auto-fire""!"
Lisa,"I am just calling home, I am not asking to come home."
Lisa,"Oh, Grampa, you're not busy are you?"
Lisa,"Uh-huh. So, anything else you want to talk about?"
Lisa,"Bart, I got a cassette from Mom and Dad! I thought we could listen to it together."
Lisa,Lisa. You're talking to Lisa.
Lisa,Okay. I'm not gonna give up. Solitude never hurt anyone. Emily Dickinson lived alone and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known! And went crazy as a loon.
Lisa,"Ech, I'm tired of being an issue, Bart. Maybe everyone would be better off if I just quit."
Lisa,Why'd you say that?
Lisa,Don't do that. Why should we both be outcasts?
Lisa,Will you stop looking at your feet?!
Lisa,This wasn't in the brochure.
Lisa,"Meet me at The Eliminator"" after lights out. P.S. The cadets are planning to throw their meatballs at you."
Lisa,"Oh, it's too hard. My hand is slipping."
Lisa,"I can't do this, Bart. I'm not strong enough."
Lisa,Duh! A challenge I could do.
Lisa,Bees. Bees.
Lisa,Yes!
Lisa,"Well, at least they're talking to me..."
Lisa,"Oh, if only I were in Springfield, all my friends would be cheering me on. Oh, God, I'm delirious!"
Lisa,Yes! You thought I couldn't but I could I did! and I could do it again let's do it again!
Lisa,"I can't, they're stuck."
Lisa,"A medal? Thank you, Sir!"
Lisa,For satisfactory completion of the second grade.
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,HEY!!
Lisa,"Dad, you got a letter from the City of New York!"
Lisa,"""Dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of Manhattan..."""
Lisa,"""...If you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car will be thrown into the East River at your expense."""
Lisa,"Dad, you can't judge a place you've never been to."
Lisa,"Aw, I'd love to see New York. We could all go with the bus company's special Supersitter Fare!"
Lisa,"Dad, our baby pictures were in there!"
Lisa,I just think we should have paid the extra dollar-fifty and gotten a bus with restrooms.
Lisa,We're here!
Lisa,"Here's a better idea -- you give me your address, and I'll write to you."
Lisa,"Hey, where's Bart?"
Lisa,"Actually, I think we're in Chinatown now."
Lisa,"Mom, are those rabbits dead?"
Lisa,"Look at all those beautiful shoes! I know they're made from animals, but wow!"
Lisa,"Okay, Dad..."
Lisa,Kickin' It! A Musical Journey Through the Betty Ford Center.
Lisa,Shhh! They're strapping down Liza Minelli.
Lisa,What a perfect way to end our day in New York.
Lisa,"What a magical city! Can we come back next year, Dad?"
Lisa,Ralph and I could do the report together.
Lisa,"...So in 1966, a brave young man named Seymour Skinner enlisted and shipped out to Vietnam, where he rose to become Platoon Sergeant. Ralph?"
Lisa,Sgt. Skinner was a hero. He risked capture many times behind enemy lines.
Lisa,"And he survived to make it back to Springfield, where he became the fine educator we salute tonight."
Lisa,I admit Sgt. Skinner seems okay... but Mr. Tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration.
Lisa,"His name doesn't matter. ""A rose by any other name would smell as sweet."""
Lisa,"But Dad, I'm supposed to practice an hour a day!"
Lisa,You'll practice me? What does that mean? Is it supposed to be some sort of threat?
Lisa,"Look, Bart. I have to practice my saxophone and you can't stop me."
Lisa,No!
Lisa,I said no!
Lisa,Oh yeah?
Lisa,"Dad, you don't understand. This saxophone is like my oldest friend. I've had it for as long as I can remember."
Lisa,Nuh-uh.
Lisa,"Look, Mama!"
Lisa,Yeah. Except you were supposed to be telling the story of how I got my saxophone!
Lisa,"Mom, can you tell me the story of how I got my saxophone and not have it turn into a story about Bart!"
Lisa,Mom!
Lisa,I am three and three eighths!
Lisa,Two apples!
Lisa,Wave of da future!
Lisa,And my gifts are still going to waste.
Lisa,I'm Lisa!
Lisa,You have thirteen pickled eggs in this jar! And one cockroach!
Lisa,That one!
Lisa,"Well, I really liked that story. But it still doesn't fix this."
Lisa,"Well, don't worry about me, Dad. It's not how it looks, it's how it sounds."
Lisa,"""Dear Lisa, May your new saxophone bring you years of D'oh!"""
Lisa,That's not gonna protect us from anything.
Lisa,I won't.
Lisa,I know it's good.
Lisa,I'm happy for you.
Lisa,All the layers of lead paint in this house made it the perfect bomb shelter.
Lisa,Yo! / Yayyy! I do! / I do! / Right here! / Yay! / I do! / Let's go!
Lisa,"Wow, look at all these gadgets! If I were a nerd, I'd be in heaven."
Lisa,Ow! Someone just punched me in the face!
Lisa,"Mom, stop! According to this, it says Bart mixed up his DNA with a fly's. I think that's Bart!"
Lisa,"Good one, Dad."
Lisa,"There's one thing I still don't understand. When Bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?"
Lisa,Bart! Is that you?!
Lisa,I can't hear you. Wait! Fly into my saxophone!
Lisa,"Oh no! And I let him use my toothbrush! Well, that hideous creep doesn't scare me."
Lisa,"Mom, Dad, help! He's trying to kill me!"
Lisa,"You just made a big mistake, Fly Boy."
Lisa,Hey! It worked!
Lisa,"If they're really witches, why don't they use their powers to escape?"
Lisa,Never mind.
Lisa,"Bart, quit it!"
Lisa,"Stop! Doesn't the Bible say ""Judge not lest ye be judged""?"
Lisa,"Dad, that's our house."
Lisa,"Can we go, Dad? / Please Dad? / Please, please, please? / Can we go, huh, huh please? /"
Lisa,Hey look. It's Pelé!
Lisa,Somebody's gotta stop them!
Lisa,Dad! It's three A.M.! Can't you mutter in your room?
Lisa,All right. Go ahead.
Lisa,That would have made a lot more sense.
Lisa,Dad! The 2nd Amendment is just a remnant from Revolutionary days. It has no meaning today.
Lisa,No...
Lisa,"No, thanks!"
Lisa,"Can you help me get my ball down from the roof, Dad?"
Lisa,"No offense, Mom, but that was pretty cool."
Lisa,"Can we go swimmin', Mom?"
Lisa,And so is the Bible!
Lisa,"Yes I am! Come on, Spotty!"
Lisa,This bed is making me nauseous. Why won't it stop?!
Lisa,Yayyy!
Lisa,Did anyone stop that robber?
Lisa,"Mom, mom. I stepped in a bear trap."
Lisa,"Hey, Tubby. Want another Pop-Tart, Tubby?"
Lisa,What position have you got for me?
Lisa,That's right. A girl wants to play football. How about that?
Lisa,You do?
Lisa,Well... football's not really my thing.
Lisa,"After all, what civilized person would play a game with the skin of an innocent pig?!"
Lisa,I've gotta go.
Lisa,"Dad, that was really mean."
Lisa,I don't want to make the team.
Lisa,I got it.
Lisa,"Well, I know you don't want to disappoint Dad, but how do you feel about lying to him?"
Lisa,"Mom, please, we're eating!"
Lisa,Aren't there any good bachelors in this town?
Lisa,Just tell them about yourself.
Lisa,Ohhhh. / Hiiiii.
Lisa,Can I ask you about your dot?
Lisa,What's the deal with that dot?
Lisa,Fully. We have to go now.
Lisa,Why is that woman still living here?
Lisa,"Which Bombay to Springfield flight is she on? The 10 o'clock, the 10:15, or the 10:30?"
Lisa,It's the tradition in India.
Lisa,You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him.
Lisa,"Dad, those peanuts aren't for you, they're for the elephant."
Lisa,Why would a motorboat have a mast?
Lisa,"Hey, they can't just build a parking lot on Saber Tooth Meadow. That's where they discovered all those fossils!"
Lisa,"But they might be paving over rare specimens. Pull over so we can complain, Dad. Come on, who wants to complain with me?"
Lisa,Fine. I'll come back later. Who wants to come back with me? Fine.
Lisa,"My attorney, Lionel Hutz, calls your attention to Municipal Code 147-c: ""Protection of antiquities and fossils."""
Lisa,"Oh, but what if they missed something? You have to allow an archeological survey!"
Lisa,"Mr. Hutz, we won."
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, remember how I didn't sue when I found that scorpion in my applesauce? Well, I'm calling in a favor."
Lisa,This is so exciting! I can't wait to see what we find!
Lisa,"Okay, everyone! Back to work! You never know when we might uncover a Tyrannosaurus."
Lisa,Don't give up! I'm sure we'll find something!
Lisa,"C'mon, c'mon! A bottle cap, a shoe, a bar of gold, anything! She suddenly uncovers a white patch."
Lisa,Everybody! Come quick!
Lisa,"Look, there's more. What the heck is this thing?"
Lisa,"Oh, my goodness."
Lisa,It looks like a human skeleton... but these other bones look almost like wings.
Lisa,"Well, obviously that's impossible--"
Lisa,But it can't be an angel!
Lisa,"Well, maybe it's, uh, uh... a Neanderthal, who got bitten by some angry fish."
Lisa,It could be anything. It could be a mutant from the nuclear plant.
Lisa,Hey! / What are you...? / Wait a minute. / Wait! Wait! Wait! / Settle down! / No! No! No! / Excuse me! / No! No!
Lisa,"Ahh, here's Dr. Gould now. What were the results, Professor?"
Lisa,"Dad, it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel. There's no proof of that."
Lisa,What about that sign right there?
Lisa,Just let me take it to the museum for one day. They can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel.
Lisa,Wow... so lifelike.
Lisa,It's a bone scraping from that skeleton I found.
Lisa,Quite preposterous. But no one will believe me until I can prove what it really is. Can't you do a DNA test or something?
Lisa,"Oh, thank you so much! Uhm... you know I can't afford to pay you."
Lisa,Excuse me. I took a piece of the skeleton for scientific analysis. Soon we will have all the facts.
Lisa,Inconclusive? Then why did you come running up like that?
Lisa,But--
Lisa,I am home.
Lisa,"Ugh, those morons make me so angry."
Lisa,But they are morons. What grown person could believe in angels?
Lisa,"You? But... you're an intelligent person, Mom."
Lisa,It's not that I don't have a spiritual side. I just find it hard to believe there's a dead angel hanging in our garage.
Lisa,"Don't feel sorry for me, Mom. I feel sorry for you."
Lisa,Kent.
Lisa,"I just think it's a fantasy. If you believe in angels, then why not unicorns, or sea monsters, or leprechauns?"
Lisa,"Look, you can either accept science and face reality, or you can believe in angels and live in a childish dream world."
Lisa,"Ugh, I wish I'd never found those stupid bones! It's time to put an end to this. Bart, I'm borrowing your blue crowbar."
Lisa,It's gone...
Lisa,Nothing. Someone must have stolen it.
Lisa,Hardly. Anyone could have written that.
Lisa,"Will you leave me alone? It's bad enough you're making me go to your stupid ""Judgment Day""."
Lisa,"Nothing is going to happen, Mom. I hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end."
Lisa,"Well, there you go. I hope you all learned a val--"
Lisa,Wait a second! You planted a phony skeleton for me to find! This was all a big hoax.
Lisa,"You exploited people's deepest beliefs just to hawk your cheesy wares?! Well, we are outraged! Aren't we?!"
Lisa,"I don't understand, Professor. Why didn't your tests show the skeleton was a fake?"
Lisa,"Well, it was just so loud and... Heh, heh, heh... Thanks for sqeezing back."
Lisa,"Don't worry, Mom. We'll help you study."
Lisa,"Oh, don't listen to my husband. He's just an idiot. Now, I'm a veterinarian and I need to keep lots of sick animals in my house. Is that permitted?"
Lisa,"When I had to learn about the Magna Carta, I made up a song. ""In 1215 at Runnymede!/ Doo dah, doo dah/ The nobles and the King agreed!/ Oh, d-doo dah day..."""
Lisa,"""On the closing day!/ The escrow agents pay!/ Taxes, liens, and interest, too, thanks to Fannie Mae!"""
Lisa,Yay!/ Way to go!
Lisa,Ah! Dad! Doesn't this car have seat belts?
Lisa,That's not true. You're thinking of airbags.
Lisa,Wow! / Your own billboard! / Check it out!
Lisa,"Ah, so you don't have that killer instinct. Big deal."
Lisa,Um-hmmm.
Lisa,"Well, I'm proud of you, Mom. You refused to compromise your integrity."
Lisa,This year's tree is just perfect. That old aluminum one was so fake.
Lisa,"Bart, did you hear that?"
Lisa,Mom! Make him stop!
Lisa,"You didn't invent that, Bart. The Indians used to drink water to wake up early for their attacks."
Lisa,Dad...
Lisa,"Bart, what were you doing outside?"
Lisa,"Hey, why don't we walk over to Grampa's and cheer up the old folks? That'll make us feel better."
Lisa,Nothing could be as fun as that looks.
Lisa,"Sorry, Daddy."
Lisa,"Bart, this is Patches, and what was your name?"
Lisa,Here comes Santa Claus / Here comes Santa Claus / Right down Santa Claus Lane... Vixen and Blitzen all the reindeer pulling at the reins... / Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh...
Lisa,Turn into the skid!
Lisa,Bail out!
Lisa,No burglar? / What? / what's he mean?
Lisa,Why you little...
Lisa,And after we spent all the townspeople's money.
Lisa,I think they're running out of tomatoes.
Lisa,"Um, Miss Hoover! Miss Hoover!"
Lisa,"But we don't have $15,000."
Lisa,"Run, Mom!"
Lisa,I guess we better get used to being pariahs.
Lisa,What?
Lisa,But we would have had each other anyway.
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,"Did you get ""Emma?"" Did you get ""Emma?"" Did ya? Did ya? Did ya? Huh?"
Lisa,He's dreamy.
Lisa,"You like musicals, don't you Dad?"
Lisa,"THAT WAS PRETTY BAD, BART / BUT IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE / YOU COULD HAVE BEEN CARRYING A SEQUINED PURSE!"
Lisa,OOOOOO.
Lisa,"MANY PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN / SING LIKE WE DO / THERE'S MISTER BURNS, THERE'S KRUSTY, AND EVEN APU."
Lisa,"BECAUSE HE WAS SINGING, WE OVERHEARD HIS PLAN / AND COULD SAVE THOSE DOGS FROM THAT MEAN OLD MAN."
Lisa,WE CAN'T EVEN GET ANY LOCAL LAWS PASSED / WITHOUT EVERYONE SINGING LIKE A BIG BROADWAY CAST.
Lisa,THERE IS SOMETHING WORSE...
Lisa,You turn it on. I turned it on yesterday.
Lisa,Sure we do. Ding ding ding ding ding.
Lisa,Ding ding ding ding ding...
Lisa,"That's a good suggestion, Mom."
Lisa,No! Then who'd chop off my hands?
Lisa,Bring it in here.
Lisa,Hard work made us quit.
Lisa,Okay. We get our room and board free anyway.
Lisa,The Carnival!
Lisa,"Oh boy! / All right, free money! / Wow!"
Lisa,I want some Fried Sugar!
Lisa,This isn't very scary.
Lisa,That was just confusing.
Lisa,We just saw the most amazing camel!
Lisa,"Why did you shudder just now, Mom?"
Lisa,Ewww!
Lisa,"I was wrong about the Cooders, Dad. They're the nicest of all the transients you've ever brought home."
Lisa,And how. / Heck yeah. / Yes they are. / You betcha.
Lisa,They're squatting in our house?
Lisa,"Bart, you're brushing your teeth with my twig."
Lisa,Ugh! One of them's playing my saxophone!
Lisa,"Oh, no! The spit valve! Release the spit valve!"
Lisa,Well... if we did set fire to the house...
Lisa,"Oh, I can't watch."
Lisa,"No we don't, Mother!"
Lisa,"Watch yourself, Dad. You're the highly suggestible type."
Lisa,"Dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?"
Lisa,Dad and all these other people are obviously the products of mental conditioning.
Lisa,We toil in the fields and he rides around in a Rolls Royce?
Lisa,He's wrong! You're wrong! The whole damn system is wrong!
Lisa,Grades?
Lisa,We love the Leader!
Lisa,Yaaay! Here comes the Leader!
Lisa,Oh yeah! / Absolutely! / At least twice as much!
Lisa,The hell with him! / What Leader? / He can take a flying leap as far as I'm concerned! / Lea-who?
Lisa,Hoverbikes!!
Lisa,Yayyy!
Lisa,But we heard them hovering!
Lisa,It's wonderful to think for ourselves again.
Lisa,We are watching Fox.
Lisa,"Yeah, Mom, c'mon. You let us stay up to watch Troy McClure in such other bible epics as ""David vs. Super Goliath"" and ""Suddenly, Last Supper."""
Lisa,"Aw, those poor badgers are soaked."
Lisa,"Point of order. If we want to learn anything, we must respect..."
Lisa,"Hey, Martin seconded the motion. It's entirely his fault."
Lisa,What about the rest of us?
Lisa,All we found were these oozing berries. And they look pretty poisonous.
Lisa,Knock it off. We gotta find a way to light a fire.
Lisa,She's really hungry.
Lisa,Wait a minute... We had a cooler full of snacks on the bus.
Lisa,"We may have to live on this food for a long time, so no more till tomorrow."
Lisa,"No one, but if we're gonna survive, we need rules and order. Let's not forget what we learned in the U.N. Club."
Lisa,"Not now, Martin."
Lisa,Who wants rations?
Lisa,Wait! We're not savages! We live in a society of law. Milhouse has the right to a fair trial!
Lisa,"Your honor, the defense calls its first and only witness: Milhouse Van Houten."
Lisa,"Milhouse, did you steal the food?"
Lisa,Could anyone else have taken it?
Lisa,Milhouse! I am defending you!
Lisa,The defense has just one more question.
Lisa,Did any one of you actually see Milhouse eat the food?
Lisa,I rest my case.
Lisa,Object-Objection! He's not asking any questions!
Lisa,The law has spoken.
Lisa,"Stop! Leave Milhouse alone! Help me out here, Bart."
Lisa,RUN-A-WAY!
Lisa,"Aw, crud. / Aw, come on, man."
Lisa,Look! We can hide in that cave!
Lisa,We should be safe in here.
Lisa,"Oh, figs."
Lisa,Stop! You are in violation of the Model U.N. Charter!
Lisa,"Uh, that's right. The U.N. doesn't look too kindly on..."
Lisa,"Hey... If a boar can survive here, there must be a source of food."
Lisa,"Look, he's licking the slime off that rock! That's what he's been eating -- slime! And there's enough slime for all of us! We're saved!"
Lisa,"Ah, shut up. Savages."
Lisa,Oh rats! Talk about bad luck! I forgot to wear socks today. Guess I can't try those on.
Lisa,Ewww!
Lisa,"Mom, these are at least two sizes too big."
Lisa,"No, Dad, it's to fight soil erosion."
Lisa,"Dad, the zebra didn't do it. It's just a word at the end of the dictionary."
Lisa,It's just a joke.
Lisa,He said there's no shame in their forbidden love.
Lisa,"""Take me here, under the disco ball."""
Lisa,"One's residential, the other is business."
Lisa,Me too...
Lisa,"I love you, Mom!"
Lisa,"Ow! Bart, that has nuts in it!"
Lisa,"Actually, we can't take a bath anyway. The water heater is broken."
Lisa,"You look a little nervous, Dad."
Lisa,"Dad, we're the visitors."
Lisa,I bought my lunch at the gas station.
Lisa,It's the kind John Glenn eats when he's not in space.
Lisa,Professor Provolone's Picto-Puzzle.
Lisa,I'll get it in a second. Don't worry.
Lisa,"Hey, some of us are still trying to solve it!"
Lisa,Maybe I can't concentrate because of all your cooties.
Lisa,"Okay, let's see, it's not Egyptian. It's not Prince's names."
Lisa,"I don't need a hint, Ralph!"
Lisa,"For your information, none of your business!"
Lisa,"If you're suggesting I stayed up all night trying to solve that childish puzzle, you're right."
Lisa,Ugh! Now I can't remember my combination!
Lisa,The project! I forgot all about it!
Lisa,I'm finished. I've just got to...oh... there!
Lisa,It's a pig!
Lisa,"And a spring for his curly tail! Huh-huh. Oink, oink, oink...Huh-huh!"
Lisa,"Me, too."
Lisa,Darn it!!
Lisa,"Mom, I think something's wrong with me. I can't do anything right lately."
Lisa,It can't just be a bad day. I feel like I'm getting dumber by the minute.
Lisa,What are you talkin' about?
Lisa,"Wow, Dad was a good speller?"
Lisa,Grampa!
Lisa,This is just two years ago!
Lisa,This is crazy! Just because you and Dad and Bart went downhill doesn't mean it's gonna happen to me... does it?
Lisa,Dear Log: Can it be true? Do all Simpsons go through a process of dumbening?
Lisa,"Wait, that's not how you spell ""dumbening."" Wait, ""dumbening"" isn't even a word!"
Lisa,Oh... I've got to find out more...
Lisa,Time is running out.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,That didn't answer anything. I need more information.
Lisa,"Isn't there any way I can change my DNA, like sitting on the microwave?"
Lisa,Dear Log: My worst fears have been confirmed. I've hit my mental and creative peak at the tender age of eight. What will my life be like after I descend into mediocrity?
Lisa,"Well, Ralph seems happy enough... Maybe I should just give up now and settle into a mindless, happy stupor..."
Lisa,"Yeah... Huh, huh, huh, maybe people got hurt!"
Lisa,All right! Sounds good!
Lisa,"If she started dinner three minutes earlier, we wouldn't be in this mess!"
Lisa,But those candy bars are all squished and melted.
Lisa,Quit it... quit it... quit... You kids knock it off! Mama's watchin' her stories!
Lisa,"Hey, angel pie. Can you drive me down the libarry? I wanna rent us up some movies."
Lisa,"Wesley, get Mama's pryin' bar."
Lisa,Easy does it now... easy... little more... yea... right... that's the spot... ooah!
Lisa,No!!
Lisa,I don't want to turn out that way!
Lisa,Like you!!
Lisa,"Dear Log: It won't be long now before my mind melts into a soft Simpsony sludge. Soon, the arts and literature I love will be replaced by talk radio and vulgar mud flaps. It's time to give my brain its last meal."
Lisa,"Oh, Kenny, look at the interplay of light and shadow. It's so luminous and vibrant."
Lisa,You have to listen to the notes she's not playing!
Lisa,Great set!
Lisa,"Ah, they just came for the buffalo wings. But you really got through to me."
Lisa,"Yeah, while you still can... Thanks!"
Lisa,"Uh, I am! I'm strongly opposed to... Proposition, uh, 3-0-5..."
Lisa,"Uhh, you bet I am!"
Lisa,Hello. My name is Lisa Simpson.
Lisa,I'm supposed to talk to you about Proposition 305...
Lisa,"...but I have something more important to say. For reasons beyond my control, I will soon become vapid, sluggish, and slow-witted. So before that happens, I want to share some things with you that have really meant a lot to me..."
Lisa,"And please don't deprive yourself of wonderful books like ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", ""Harriet The Spy"", and ""Yertle the Turtle"", possibly the best book ever written on the subject of turtle-stacking..."
Lisa,"Beauty is all around us, and not just in pageants and parlors. You can find it in the swirl of galaxies or the swirl in the center of a sunflower..."
Lisa,"So, please, I beg you, don't take your brain for granted. It's the best friend you'll ever have..."
Lisa,Why bother?
Lisa,I'm adopted?
Lisa,Doctor?
Lisa,"That means you went to college, right?"
Lisa,So all the Simpson women turn out okay?
Lisa,So I'm not doomed!
Lisa,"Oh Dad, I've never been happier to be your daughter."
Lisa,Dearest Log: I am me again! And I feel like there's nothing I can't do...except this stupid brain teas...
Lisa,I got it! Woo hoo! I mean... splendid.
Lisa,What a whimsical building! Who says science can't be fun?
Lisa,Wowww!
Lisa,I wanna read the giant book!
Lisa,Let's just pray this hits the prison.
Lisa,Ralph? But the rocket was my idea.
Lisa,"But surely, I deserve some credit for..."
Lisa,Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!
Lisa,Are you thinking of joining the Naval Reserve?
Lisa,"Eh, sort of."
Lisa,"Good luck, Dad. Although I am morally opposed to the military-industrial complex of which you are now a part."
Lisa,An earring? How rebellious in a conformist sort of way.
Lisa,Can I?
Lisa,"Be careful, Dad."
Lisa,I told him that photo would come back to haunt him.
Lisa,"I think you're a hero, Dad."
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,That was last year's taxes! You have to pay again this year!
Lisa,The government has no right to use you this way.
Lisa,"No, it makes you look like a tool of government oppression."
Lisa,"Who needs college, Mom. We're trillionaires! Let's buy dune buggies."
Lisa,"Oh, my gosh! Today's top story: ""Little Girl on Cloud Nine as Dream Comes True."""
Lisa,I know. I already jumped to that conclusion.
Lisa,Me?
Lisa,...And I'll be able to tackle all the hard-hitting children's news the grown-up controlled media won't touch. Plus I get to be on TV!
Lisa,"Well, we used to date. Plus, he threatened me."
Lisa,"Back off, Bart. This may be the only chance I get as a second grader to produce my own TV show, and I'm not gonna let you screw it up."
Lisa,Mo-om...
Lisa,"Come on, quit foolin' around, you guys."
Lisa,"Bart, get out of my anchor chair."
Lisa,"Come on, this isn't a joke. All over town, kids are just waking up from their naps, cranky and hungry for the news."
Lisa,"Thank you. Our top story today: in a move that could affect children townwide, the library book-purchase committee slashed its budget by three percent. First on the chopping block, periodicals."
Lisa,"And now, sports."
Lisa,"Sorry, Bart, but you've got to take some things seriously."
Lisa,What?!
Lisa,"I don't need a co-anchor. I'm a straight ""A"" student."
Lisa,"What is ""zazz""?"
Lisa,"Zork? What is ""zork""?"
Lisa,"But that trivializes the whole idea of kids news. I mean, let's be honest. Bart's not exactly the brightest penny in the fountain."
Lisa,"Look, I love Bart... But he's never even read a newspaper."
Lisa,"Between you and me, he's well... kinda dumb."
Lisa,"We'll bring you more on this chalk shortage as it continues. And now, Bart's been looking into that alleged ham salad from yesterday's school lunch."
Lisa,"Bart, I really think we should stick--"
Lisa,That's Kids News. Good night.
Lisa,That wasn't news. That was sappy manipulative drivel.
Lisa,"You didn't feel for him either, you big fat phony."
Lisa,It's Lisa.
Lisa,They want cheap sentiment? I'll pump 'em so full of sap they'll be blowing their nose with a pancake.
Lisa,"They call her the Cat Lady. People say she's crazy, just because she has a few dozen cats. But can anyone who loves animals that much really be crazy?"
Lisa,The old Union Pacific doesn't come by here much anymore...
Lisa,"Hmm, thank you, Bart, for yet another touching ""Bart's People."" Now, turning to--"
Lisa,"That's what Veterans Day is for, Bart."
Lisa,They also have Memorial Day.
Lisa,They have two.
Lisa,"What does that even mean? Mom might not see through you, but I do. You don't care about any of these people."
Lisa,Stop talking like that! Stop it!
Lisa,"""Bart's show."" If everybody knew what a phony Bart was, he'd be off that show so fast... I've got it!"
Lisa,"Hey, here's another letter for Bart's People."
Lisa,Oh-how-terrible-read-on.
Lisa,"It is, isn't it?"
Lisa,"Oh, Bart, you'll have to ride your bike pretty fast to get out there in time..."
Lisa,They gave you a chopper?!
Lisa,"Eww. Thank you, Milhouse. Now it's time for today's special live edition of Bart's People."
Lisa,"Oh, no! What have I done?!"
Lisa,"Nelson, cover for me."
Lisa,"Willie, stop!"
Lisa,"No, you can't hurt Bart. He's... Well, he's... your son!"
Lisa,"Well, not literally. But in a way, isn't he everyone's son? For you see, that little ""hell-raiser"" is the spawn of every shrieking commercial, every brain-rotting soda pop, every teacher who cares less about young minds than about cashing their big, fat paychecks. No, Bart's not to blame. You can't create a monster and then whine when he stomps on a few buildings. I'm Lisa Simpson."
Lisa,"Boy, that phony schmaltz of yours sure is powerful stuff."
Lisa,"You know, Bart, if we combined your showmanship with my integrity, we could make kids really care about the news."
Lisa,I can't believe they cancelled us for this stupid...
Lisa,"Come on, Mom, the stores just invented this holiday to make money."
Lisa,"Uh, what a terrible waste!"
Lisa,"It's full, Dad. That means you have to take out the trash."
Lisa,"Dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by a simple apology?"
Lisa,"Yeah Dad, you're always telling me and Bart to apologize."
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,"Aren't you gonna buy it, Dad?"
Lisa,"Wow, Dad, you're really working hard."
Lisa,"'CAUSE HE'S HOMER SIMPSON, MAN"
Lisa,"You know Dad, there's a lesson in all this. Many cities have problems with garbage disposal, and it's time we realized you can't just..."
Lisa,Drugs.
Lisa,That's awful! I almost wish it were drugs.
Lisa,"But Dad, you can't cram garbage under Springfield forever."
Lisa,"So we transplant the town. We're just gonna trash the new Springfield, too."
Lisa,"Dad, what have you done to your stomach?"
Lisa,I've got some!
Lisa,Uh... Mom?
Lisa,"Family to Dad. Family to Dad. Come in, Dad!"
Lisa,Where in the world did you find a sled on top of the--
Lisa,This exhibit is a once-in-a-lifetime event. It's the first time these Egyptian artifacts have been allowed out of England.
Lisa,"Oh, I can't wait! In just twenty minutes, we'll be in a three hour line to see the Orb of Isis."
Lisa,"Bart, did you glue those on?"
Lisa,Wait! You promised to take me to the museum!
Lisa,What if I took a bus?
Lisa,But it's the last day of the Isis exhibit!
Lisa,Dad?
Lisa,It's Lisa. I just called to tell you how much I love you and can I take the bus to the museum?
Lisa,"Ahm... I wasn't a hundred per cent clear on that. She said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get Bart to the emergency room."
Lisa,"Well... if it would put your mind at ease, I could take a limousine. Although that would cost two hundred dollars..."
Lisa,"Hmm. I guess I could take the bus, if you think that's a better idea."
Lisa,"Oh, all right."
Lisa,Yes!
Lisa,"Ah, the old Number 22. Clean, reliable public transportation. The chariot of the people. The ride of choice for the poor and very poor alike. Sure, some folks prefer--"
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,"Look! It's the bus! The bus! Come on, you're gonna miss the bus!"
Lisa,That's one small step f-- Whoa!
Lisa,"Hi, Larry."
Lisa,"I'm sorry, it's just that on the school bus--"
Lisa,May I sit there?
Lisa,May I have that seat?
Lisa,Never mind.
Lisa,Crackton? That doesn't sound right.
Lisa,"Um... excuse me, sir. When does this bus get to the museum?"
Lisa,Oh! But isn't this the 22?
Lisa,22A?! Then where the heck am I?
Lisa,But I'm lost and I need to know where --
Lisa,I should've got off in Crackton.
Lisa,"Okay, the museum's got to be north of here. Now which way is north...?"
Lisa,"Aha! It's springtime, so the geese must be flying back north."
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,How could I confuse bus 22 with bus 22A?
Lisa,Area 51? I found Area 51!
Lisa,"Well, um, I'm kind of lost. Can you tell me where I am?"
Lisa,Stupid bus that can't even go to the stupid place it's supposed to stupid go.
Lisa,Yahhh!
Lisa,"Uh-huh. Um, listen, I'm kind of lost. Do you think you could give me a lift downtown?"
Lisa,I didn't know Springfield had a Russian district.
Lisa,Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get to the museum?
Lisa,"No, thanks!"
Lisa,"Oh, that's it. I give up."
Lisa,"Excuse me, ma'am? Uh, hello? Somebody? Anybody?"
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,"Hang on, Dad!"
Lisa,Look out!
Lisa,Hurry! Hurry! Lower the bridge!
Lisa,"Dad, grab onto it!"
Lisa,No!
Lisa,"Are you sure you don't want to go to a doctor? I mean, a drawbridge did close on your head."
Lisa,"I should have known I wasn't old enough to take the bus alone, but I really wanted to see that exhibit. I'll never take another stupid risk like that again!"
Lisa,What?
Lisa,I guess...
Lisa,Dad! You're headed for the river again!
Lisa,"Dad, are you all right?"
Lisa,See the Isis exhibit. But the museum's closed.
Lisa,"Dad, I'm kind of scared."
Lisa,Okay... Here goes.
Lisa,Wowww. It's magnificent.
Lisa,Now I know how Sir Dudley Winthrop felt when he first fell through the ceiling and discovered the Temple of Isis.
Lisa,Have you ever seen such exquisite Ushabtis?
Lisa,Ohmigosh! It's the mysterious Orb of Isis.
Lisa,"Archaeologists have been studying it for decades, and still have no clue what it means."
Lisa,"Oh! We can't touch it, Dad. It's behind a velvet rope! A velvet rope."
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,You broke it!
Lisa,"It's a music box! Dad, we uncovered the secret!"
Lisa,"It's so beautiful. And just think, we're the first people to hear its song in more than four thousand years."
Lisa,"Thanks for making me take such a stupid risk, Dad."
Lisa,"It's kind of humbling, isn't it? The music we just heard might never be heard again."
Lisa,"Dad, that's the Old Spice song."
Lisa,Do do do do-do / Do do do do-do / Do do do do do do do do.
Lisa,Playin' Hot Wheels.
Lisa,Yayyy!
Lisa,"Happy Anniversary, Mom and Dad!"
Lisa,Wow! This is the best anniversary ever.
Lisa,Someone left the freezer door open and the motor burned out. We can get a new one.
Lisa,What a weird looking vacuum cleaner.
Lisa,"Hey, public display."
Lisa,"What are we looking for, anyway?"
Lisa,It's a bottle cap.
Lisa,But it's all trash.
Lisa,Do you know you have your hands in each other's pockets?
Lisa,"Wow! An alternate ending to ""Casablanca!"" Bart, this could be priceless!"
Lisa,Unbelievable.
Lisa,I'm just a little girl.
Lisa,This should be in a museum.
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,"Uh, I was just trying to find Dave Barry's column."
Lisa,"Look, Dad, they've got every kind of paper! Looseleaf, graph, unlined, college-ruled!"
Lisa,Krusty's Speak and Say?
Lisa,I like school.
Lisa,You have a pen glued to your cowlick.
Lisa,No!
Lisa,"Come on, Bart. The bus is here."
Lisa,"Don't worry, I'll help her out. I remember how hard it was to be an outsider. Always trying to fit in... never quite feeling like..."
Lisa,Did she just tell me to shut up?
Lisa,You'll want a locker in this hallway -- it's library-adjacent.
Lisa,Is that perfume?
Lisa,"Well, you'll definitely want to get yourself a good doll. The new Malibu Stacy has an achievable chest."
Lisa,"Oh, jacks. Jacks are big. They went out for a while, but then they came roaring back."
Lisa,"Oh, don't worry, you'll pick it up fast. Once you get to foursies, you're in the zone."
Lisa,"Uh, they were... all wiped out in the big trophy fire."
Lisa,Alex! Over here! Okay if the new girl sits with us?
Lisa,"She's a little weird, but let's give her a chance."
Lisa,"Guys, this is Alex."
Lisa,"Okay, I'll go get our lunches."
Lisa,"That's it, don't be shy..."
Lisa,"Now maybe a little joke, to break the ice."
Lisa,Or a big joke.
Lisa,"Careful, now. Nobody likes a showoff."
Lisa,Where are they going?
Lisa,"Hey, wait up!"
Lisa,They left without me.
Lisa,"So, there I am being nice to Alex, and she takes all of my friends and ditches me."
Lisa,"They only like her 'cause she acts so grown up, with her perfume and her cell phone and... Oh, and get this, Mom, she drinks iced tea."
Lisa,"But, Dad..."
Lisa,"Hm, don't give it a second thought. I didn't."
Lisa,"Oh, earrings! Wow, thank you so much, Alex. But these are for pierced ears."
Lisa,But I don't think I'm ready for pierced ears.
Lisa,Absolutely.
Lisa,"Yeah, it's great. We have pony rides, sing-alongs, apple-bobbing, apple-picking, apple everything."
Lisa,"No, I didn't."
Lisa,"Um, I don't know. The ponies might be startled by the loud music."
Lisa,"Oh, then, at the risk of being unpopular, I think I'm gonna have to say..."
Lisa,"Yes, you did! Yesterday. Right by my locker."
Lisa,"Okay, girls, we're gonna need balloons, crepe paper, party hats..."
Lisa,I am not wearing this.
Lisa,"Aren't we a little young for makeup and... What do you mean, five pounds?"
Lisa,Date?
Lisa,You guys have dates?
Lisa,Stop saying hello!
Lisa,"What's ""D.M.Y.""?"
Lisa,Eww!
Lisa,"I don't want a date! And I don't want to wear perfume and cocktail dresses! Am I the only one who just wants to play hopscotch, and bake cookies, and watch ""The McLaughlin Group?"""
Lisa,Hel-lo?
Lisa,Hello?
Lisa,You're taking me! You got that?! And it's gonna be a magical evening!
Lisa,"Hey, guys."
Lisa,No doubt! Can't a girl fabulize herself before the big dance?
Lisa,"Oh. So, I guess major muffins like yourselves all have dates, huh?"
Lisa,Really? All of you?
Lisa,Unbelievable!
Lisa,Ahhhh!
Lisa,"Milhouse! I've been lookin' all over for you! Listen, you've always had a crush on me, right? Well, this is your lucky day, 'cause you're gonna take me to the dance. Pretty great, huh? See ya."
Lisa,So un-ask her.
Lisa,"Ah. What am I doing? This isn't me. I'm sorry, Milhouse."
Lisa,Lucky parameciums.
Lisa,You don't have to worry about finding dates or dancing.
Lisa,"Thanks, Mom. But I told you, I'm not going."
Lisa,You don't understand. I don't belong there. The other girls are already into fashion and make-up and dating. They make me feel like a little baby.
Lisa,"Forget it, Mom. I'm not going."
Lisa,"Mom, you can't possibly believe that."
Lisa,I'll go.
Lisa,Enjoy the dance.
Lisa,It slipped.
Lisa,"Ah, it's gonna be a long night."
Lisa,"Oh, I don't want to go in there with all the happy dancing couples."
Lisa,"All right, all right. D.M.Y."
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,What happened?
Lisa,Kids?
Lisa,"It's because they are kids. And so are we. C'mon, Alex, we've only got nine, maybe ten years tops where we can giggle in church, and chew with our mouths open, and go days without bathing. We'll never have that freedom again."
Lisa,"Oh, act your age."
Lisa,"Hi, Dad. How was work?"
Lisa,"Come on, let's get you into your favorite shirt."
Lisa,Surprise!
Lisa,"Homer Simpson, welcome to your life!"
Lisa,There you are in outer space. That's pretty impressive.
Lisa,"It was Thomas Edison, Dad."
Lisa,"That, too. He also invented the phonograph, the microphone, and the electric car."
Lisa,It's true. I read it on a place mat at a restaurant.
Lisa,"You've started smoking, Dad?"
Lisa,Okay. Umm... automatic...
Lisa,Fluorescent...
Lisa,Lazy father...
Lisa,"Dad, women won't like being shot in the face."
Lisa,You expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms?
Lisa,"Somebody had to tell him, Mom. In the long run, it's much kinder to--"
Lisa,Homer! / Dad! / Look out!
Lisa,"They're on hinges. That's really ingenious, Dad."
Lisa,"Me, too!"
Lisa,"Dad, those should be your millions."
Lisa,"Mom, they put every kid in America in that book, just so gullible parents will buy it. It's all a big scam."
Lisa,"Move it, poky."
Lisa,"Uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?"
Lisa,"Hang in there, Dad! Just half a basket left!"
Lisa,Yes! A Maggie-oop!
Lisa,So what prize did you end up getting?
Lisa,Fake mustache.
Lisa,Wanna comb it?
Lisa,But Mom said not to!
Lisa,What the heck's going on?
Lisa,"Bart? Uhh, he went to play with a friend."
Lisa,"No, no. I'm pretty sure he's with Milhouse."
Lisa,"That never happened, Dad."
Lisa,I see an eye!
Lisa,A horn?
Lisa,"Dad, they aren't birds."
Lisa,"One, they don't have beaks, two, they don't have feathers, and three, they're lizards."
Lisa,Bolivian Tree Lizard?
Lisa,Wow. Did you know they had those web flaps for gliding?
Lisa,But isn't that a bit short-sighted? What happens when we're overrun by lizards?
Lisa,But aren't the snakes even worse?
Lisa,But then we're stuck with gorillas!
Lisa,"I don't get it, Bart. You got all upset when you killed one bird, but now you've killed tens of thousands and it doesn't bother you at all."
Lisa,You had it on the way over!
Lisa,"Whoaaa, Daaad!"
Lisa,"Uh, Bart?"
Lisa,Gee!
Lisa,Who'd do such a thing?
Lisa,I told you capital punishment isn't a deterrent.
Lisa,Whoaaa!
Lisa,Of course... the transplant! Somehow Snake's hair must be controlling--
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,"Ohh, Bart, that's plutonium. It's highly unstable."
Lisa,What's wrong with the TV?
Lisa,"Bart, quit it!"
Lisa,Hey... gim... ah... ah!
Lisa,How humiliating.
Lisa,To protect and sever?
Lisa,"We're done for, Bart!"
Lisa,Look!
Lisa,"Dad, you gotta get us out of here! Use the remote!"
Lisa,Dad! Push exit!
Lisa,"Oh, geez!"
Lisa,Me too.
Lisa,Poor Maggie. If only you could tell us what's happening to you.
Lisa,And now he's dead.
Lisa,Dad! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
Lisa,"Yeah, yeah. Anyway, you promised to take us to the lake."
Lisa,"Actually, keeping promises would make you a good father."
Lisa,"Dad, you really should be watching the road."
Lisa,Ready.
Lisa,"Step on it, Mom. Dad's signaling that he wants to go higher."
Lisa,Where'd you get that muffin?
Lisa,I washed the dog today.
Lisa,Of course not.
Lisa,"Don't blame us, Dad. The celebrities are the ones who canned you."
Lisa,"I didn't quite get the point of it, Dad. Why would Lenny want someone to saw his legs off?"
Lisa,"Hey, Dad, it says they need your full name. You only put down your middle initial."
Lisa,You might as well. You already made up a phony film credit.
Lisa,"Dad, do you mind? Your feet are really close to my potato."
Lisa,Uh-oh. I don't like the sound of that.
Lisa,And the soles of your feet are jet black.
Lisa,"Ah, this is my kind of aisle -- soy substitute... whizless cheese... oven-roasted cud!"
Lisa,Candy Warhol? Xavier Nougat?
Lisa,Lobsters need salt water.
Lisa,Much better.
Lisa,I'm afraid I can't allow that.
Lisa,"Mom, no, wait! We can make a deal!"
Lisa,"No, but I enjoy the smell."
Lisa,But I'm hardly learning at all.
Lisa,I am so scared.
Lisa,"All right, I guess you're supposed to go through this stupid door..."
Lisa,Hmm... I wonder what's in this glowing barrel.
Lisa,What? Nunchuks? Those aren't even Australian.
Lisa,"Oh, great. So I'm dead now? Fine, I'm sick of this stupid game anyway."
Lisa,Yes!
Lisa,I am just four power wands away from an anti-gravity lozenge. Hope I don't run into that weird little troll!
Lisa,"No, pause, pause!"
Lisa,The Wind in the Willows.
Lisa,"No, you live in a different house."
Lisa,"We'll see about that, mate."
Lisa,"No, no! Yes! That's it! Bite, bite, bite!"
Lisa,"Ah, I don't know. I mean, I could risk it, but..."
Lisa,"Oh, I really need one more day, Mom. I think the germs are regrouping. Now for breakfast I'll have hash browns, coffee and a short stack. And would it kill you to heat up the syrup?"
Lisa,But I-I might infect the other kids!
Lisa,"""The Wind in the Willows?"" Oh yeah, Ralph brought it over."
Lisa,Test?
Lisa,Okay. All right. You can bluff your way through one test.
Lisa,"""Mr. Toad has a red blank."" Okay, skip that one. ""Mr. blank needs a blank in order to blank his blank."" I am in deep blank."
Lisa,"No, not Brown!"
Lisa,"Brown, Brown, Brown..."
Lisa,"Well, actually, I do feel a little feverish."
Lisa,"I need a miracle. Come on, you owe me."
Lisa,Bart?! Shouldn't you be in class?
Lisa,"We've got a test, and I didn't read the book. I'll get a zero for sure, Bart! What do I do?"
Lisa,"Hey, I can't go in there!"
Lisa,Oh my God! These are the answers to the test! I don't wanna cheat!
Lisa,Forget it. I'd rather get a zero.
Lisa,Keep the change.
Lisa,"Well, I guess I was just on a roll."
Lisa,"Actually, there are four plusses."
Lisa,Daddd...
Lisa,"Mom, where did you get that?"
Lisa,"Uh, I am sick of everyone being so proud of me!"
Lisa,Can't you see the difference between earning something honestly and getting it by fraud?
Lisa,I don't want your dirty denominators.
Lisa,"No! I never cheated before, and I never will again! Oh, I almost wish I hadn't gotten away with it."
Lisa,What?
Lisa,"Stop it! I cheated! Cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated!"
Lisa,I cheated!
Lisa,She doesn't know. You're the only one I've told.
Lisa,But what I did was wrong.
Lisa,But we can't accept that money. It's tainted.
Lisa,"Well, if you're gonna cover this up, I'll just have to go over your head to Super--"
Lisa,Intendent--
Lisa,Chalmers.
Lisa,You can't keep this scoreboard -- because there's not gonna be any grant money! Because I cheated!
Lisa,"Aww. Way to go, Ralph."
Lisa,I guess I don't have much choice.
Lisa,"Thank you. I know this giant check is very important to everyone here. But, what's even more important is the truth."
Lisa,"Because after all, education is the search for truth..."
Lisa,"... And the truth is, we don't deserve this grant, and I don't deserve your applause. I cheated on that test."
Lisa,"But, Mom--"
Lisa,That's one grade I truly earned.
Lisa,"And the tumbleweeds tumble at 2, 4 and 6! Plus a midnight tumbling on weekends."
Lisa,"Mom, don't."
Lisa,"Hey, Dad, that light says, ""Check Engine."""
Lisa,"Oh, come on."
Lisa,Because they discovered gold right over there--
Lisa,"Uh, should we help him?"
Lisa,"Besides, nothing's too good for a wonderful, generous man like you."
Lisa,Can I fluff your pillow?
Lisa,I can't imagine Dad running away like this. Leaving his father to die.
Lisa,"Doctor Hibbert, I thought you'd located another kidney for Grampa."
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,He's waking up!
Lisa,"I know you're a little peeved at Grampa, Dad, but you've done a wonderful thing."
Lisa,Hi.
Lisa,"Oh, poor Mark Hamill."
Lisa,"Oh, my God. Someone has to go back in for Maggie!"
Lisa,"That ""change"" was a bribe."
Lisa,No he doesn't. Trains are regulated by the Federal Department of Transportation. And recent studies have shown that...
Lisa,Dad! What a nice surprise.
Lisa,I'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the town.
Lisa,"Dad, we hit Don Rickles!"
Lisa,"I've never heard of these bands, Mom. What kind of music do they play?"
Lisa,"Heh, you're not really giving my father power of attorney, are you?"
Lisa,"Why do you hate the Isotopes so much, Dad?"
Lisa,Even you?
Lisa,"Is he, Mom? You can tell me."
Lisa,"With a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs."
Lisa,"Wow, you look really hungover, Dad. What did you do last night?"
Lisa,Kids?
Lisa,Whoa / Curfew?
Lisa,But it's not fair. Adults always blame kids for everything!
Lisa,"What a beautiful night... fireflies, full moon..."
Lisa,Hippo in the House.
Lisa,"Ooh, ""The Game of Lent."""
Lisa,"Fine. We'll play ""Hippo in the House."""
Lisa,Drinking their coffee...
Lisa,Meh.
Lisa,"Hey, there is one thing we could do."
Lisa,"Wait, there's a commercial!"
Lisa,"/ Ohh, yeahhhh."
Lisa,Nelson.
Lisa,Wait! We don't need supernatural powers! We already know their secrets.
Lisa,Great. This is all gold.
Lisa,"Hey, look what I found. Grampa's old radio. Oh, wouldn't it be grand to gather 'round and have a listen?"
Lisa,"Our top secret tonight: Gay divorcée Luann Van Houten has been cheating on her boyfriend Pyro -- with his best friend, Gyro."
Lisa,And guess who's been practicing medicine without a license...
Lisa,"... that's right, Homer Simpson."
Lisa,"ADULTS! / YOU'RE SUCH A DROOLING SNORING, BOOZING BORING BUNCH / SURLY, MEANIE, THREE-MARTINI LUNCH-ERS."
Lisa,I warned you guys that seniors always vote in record numbers.
Lisa,"I did, until we came here last year."
Lisa,But it's nine digits now. What's the point of these other four numbers?
Lisa,Doughy's has terrible pizza.
Lisa,"Um, Dad..."
Lisa,It is to me.
Lisa,"Wow, you've signed up quite a few people, Dad: Sea Captain, Bumblebee Man, Comic Book Guy, the Squeaky Voiced Teen..."
Lisa,"Yeah, I'm bored too."
Lisa,It's so rigid and uncreative.
Lisa,"Oh, those poor, helpless cows."
Lisa,"Hey, what's this?"
Lisa,Vincent Price's Egg Magic!
Lisa,"Okay, now we just have to stick the feet on."
Lisa,"But it clearly says ""Feet Included."" They have to be here."
Lisa,Now what do we do?
Lisa,"Mom, this was made in 1967. They're probably out of business."
Lisa,"So, is he alive or not?"
Lisa,These Super Bowl commercials are weird.
Lisa,Unplugged.
Lisa,Isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?
Lisa,The Renaissance.
Lisa,"That's not really you, Dad. He's just a fictional character who happens to have the same name."
Lisa,"The first episode was just a pilot, Dad. Producers fiddle with shows all the time. They change characters, drop others, and push some into the background."
Lisa,Max Power??
Lisa,We should really put that in the corner.
Lisa,"What's this wrapped in a banana leaf? Mmm, smells like mint."
Lisa,Eww.
Lisa,That's not a fairy tale. It's just something that happened to you at Moe's.
Lisa,"Ohhh, it sounds so real!"
Lisa,"Dad, the vet says we shouldn't make him fetch the Sunday paper."
Lisa,"Oh, how romantic!"
Lisa,"Dad, you were supposed to pay for those snacks."
Lisa,"There's an opening, Mom!"
Lisa,"But Mom, I read that sport utility vehicles are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents."
Lisa,"Eww, why is Courtney Love on the Wheaties box?"
Lisa,"Hey, give me some of that."
Lisa,"Mom, Bart sprayed whipped cream in my eye!"
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,Bart! That's tomorrow night's dinner.
Lisa,Mom! Bart took what I said and turned it into an insult!
Lisa,"Hey, why don't you come to the Wild Animal Park with us?"
Lisa,"Bart, they're not here to entertain us."
Lisa,"But Dad, lemurs are nocturnal."
Lisa,No!
Lisa,Throw your peanuts!
Lisa,"How'd you know your plan would work, Mom?"
Lisa,"Well, this could be quite enlighten--"
Lisa,"NBC has lots of great shows, and their news and sports coverage can't be beat!"
Lisa,Fine. How about--
Lisa,"Okay, Dad, we're ready."
Lisa,Dad! Don't you remember? It's our special Saturday.
Lisa,"Why do you assume that I won't pick something fun? Let's see... Oh, this looks very educatio--"
Lisa,The book fair?
Lisa,"Oh, this is perfect!"
Lisa,No! The Smithsonian Traveling Exhibit.
Lisa,It encapsulates America and makes history come alive!
Lisa,"Sorry, Dad. My mind is made up."
Lisa,Deal.
Lisa,"Hey, how come the Smithsonian needs to be sponsored by a cel phone company?"
Lisa,"Yeah, but corporate sponsorship cheapens our nation's treasures."
Lisa,"Look, they have Lincoln's hat!"
Lisa,America's greatest citizen summed up in one piece of clothing.
Lisa,How can they put a prop from a TV show next to the Bill of Rights?
Lisa,"It guarantees all of the basic freedoms -- speech, religion, the right to a speedy trial..."
Lisa,"Dad, don't do that!"
Lisa,"Ugh, that antenna is an eyesore."
Lisa,"Yeah, well, I hope it doesn't hum too loud, 'cause I have a ton of homework to do, and if I don't finish it by..."
Lisa,My room!
Lisa,What happened to my room?!
Lisa,You gave away my room!
Lisa,"I can't believe you did this, Dad. Why didn't you put that thing in your room?"
Lisa,But where am I supposed to live?!
Lisa,"Until you taped over it, ""The Little Mermaid."""
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,Shut up.
Lisa,"Ugh, this is not gonna work."
Lisa,"Bart, stop it."
Lisa,Squeaking that chair!
Lisa,Ohhh! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it!
Lisa,"Dad, will you please tell Bart to stop squeaking his chair. I'm trying to do my homework."
Lisa,No-ho-ho...
Lisa,I am trying to do my homework.
Lisa,"Dad, why did you have to take away my room?"
Lisa,I just want to study.
Lisa,Da-ad!
Lisa,That's awful!
Lisa,"Ooh, my stomach hurts."
Lisa,"Mom, I don't feel so good."
Lisa,My tummy really hurts.
Lisa,Sounds great.
Lisa,I'm really not the chuckling type.
Lisa,"Yeah, ya know some of that all-natural stuff is really very well --"
Lisa,"They're not all crazy, Dad."
Lisa,"You know, just because you say something is crazy, doesn't make it so. And just because you think museums are boring and demolition derbies are fun, doesn't make that true either!"
Lisa,"Dad, you don't have to go to a New Age store just for me. I know you think this stuff is stupid."
Lisa,I just wish you could keep an open mind about other cultures.
Lisa,Da-ad.
Lisa,Bleagghhh!
Lisa,I'll take two hours.
Lisa,How am I supposed to hallucinate with all these swirling colors distracting me?
Lisa,"Wow, my mind just created that out of nothing. This tank is releasing the full potential of my brain."
Lisa,"Wow, I've been a cat, a tree, and Cokie Roberts! It's happening again! I wonder where I'm going this time."
Lisa,"Dad, wake up!"
Lisa,Your snoring is disturbing the dancers.
Lisa,How can you embarrass me like this? You won't sit through anything that doesn't have car crashes!
Lisa,"Boy, I can really be a pain in the butt."
Lisa,"Gee, I should cut Dad some slack. After all, he did take me to the ballet, and the Smithsonian exhibit... In fact, he takes me lots of places he hates."
Lisa,"Hi, Dad. How was it?"
Lisa,"Pretty cool. But now, whaddaya say we go do something we'll both enjoy?"
Lisa,"Not to me, Dad."
Lisa,Lousy meat-eating scum.
Lisa,Not you.
Lisa,"I'm going over to protest this disgusting new restaurant called ""The Slaughterhouse."" It's decorated with hanging steer carcasses and a fountain of blood."
Lisa,"The worst part is, you pick out your own cow and they kill it right in front of you!"
Lisa,"Wow, Dad and Bart have been everywhere! They've eaten submarine sandwiches, grinders, and hoagies."
Lisa,We're buying a new doorbell?
Lisa,"Mom, is this the one you want?"
Lisa,"Come on, Mom, let's take it for a test drive."
Lisa,"Oh, Milhouse is selling seeds! And he's coming this wa... Oh, the birds got him."
Lisa,"Wait, people are coming. I think they're Jehovah's Witnesses."
Lisa,"Dad's got it on the speed dial under ""Fire."""
Lisa,"Oh, that's it. I'm putting an end to this."
Lisa,Why is it playing over again?
Lisa,"Mom, I need to get some sleep! I have a test tomorrow in birds suddenly appear. I mean, English."
Lisa,I thought you were just a marketing gimmick.
Lisa,"We can't keep living like this. Moses, ask Pharaoh to let your people go."
Lisa,"Excuse me, uh, Pharaoh? I think Moses here has something to ask you. Go."
Lisa,"Keep that plague coming, Moses."
Lisa,"It's a plague, you moron! And we've got lots more planned, and there's nothing you can do about it!"
Lisa,"Not now, Moses. We gotta find a way outta here."
Lisa,I know we built a secret passage in here somewhere.
Lisa,"Eh, slave labor. You get what you pay for."
Lisa,We'll never be able to swim that far.
Lisa,"Hey, cut that out! I have an idea."
Lisa,"All right, Moses, lead your people."
Lisa,"Yeah, yeah. Hurry, everyone! We don't have much time!"
Lisa,"Hmm, well, actually, it looks like we're in for forty years of wandering the desert."
Lisa,"Uh, more or less. Hey, is that manna?"
Lisa,Everyone's gone!
Lisa,It's the Rapture. And I never knew true love.
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,"Dad, I really need to rest my back."
Lisa,"Dad, chew with your mouth closed. You're losing your mystique."
Lisa,"Where are you going with that junk, Dad?"
Lisa,"Well, if it'll help - Um, Mom found out her engagement ring is made of rock candy."
Lisa,Who?
Lisa,I'm sick of him already.
Lisa,"Well, Dad, if the museum didn't inspire you, maybe you should do something really radical, like Christo."
Lisa,"No, Christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects. He once wrapped the Reichstag in plastic."
Lisa,"Oh, yes, and he also set up hundreds of yellow umbrellas along the California highway..."
Lisa,"To make the world a more magical place, I guess. Although they did blow over and kill some people."
Lisa,"No, Dad, no. My point is you have to do something big and daring."
Lisa,"Well, actually, I just wrote it for a school assignment. Everyone else wrote to the Back Street Boys."
Lisa,You papier mache'd my cat?!
Lisa,"Good work, Dad."
Lisa,The future is a...
Lisa,Got me? What are you talking about? I've been volunteering here for a year.
Lisa,B-3.
Lisa,G-52.
Lisa,A banana!
Lisa,Yep!
Lisa,Their natural mushiness prevents choking and promotes regularity.
Lisa,"We tried giving them eggnog at Christmas, but it led to widespread de-shawling."
Lisa,Shhh. Don't wake them.
Lisa,Here you go. Make sure you get into every crevice.
Lisa,"The elderly aren't like you or me, Bart. They thrive on consistency, predictability, and a life with no surprises."
Lisa,"Picture yourself on a beautiful sailboat. Ahhh, can't you just feel the sea breeze in your hair?... or scalps?"
Lisa,"Now we're pulling into port. And who's waiting for us at the dock? Why, it's all your childhood dogs! I see Petey and Blackie and Schnoodle and..."
Lisa,"Bart, what are you doing?"
Lisa,"Oh no, Bart has stolen the elderly!"
Lisa,Bart Simpson!
Lisa,"Bart, are you crazy? You've got to get the old folks home to the Old Folks Home."
Lisa,"Gee, Bart, maybe you were right."
Lisa,They don't even seem to care that it's medication time.
Lisa,How could you miss that huge boat coming right at us?
Lisa,Jack LaLanne!
Lisa,What the heck's going on?
Lisa,Why don't you finish your own darn...
Lisa,"Hey, Mom, look!"
Lisa,Why can't we see it now?
Lisa,"Yeah, me too."
Lisa,"Ooh, I hear this really sucks. Hm, ""Director's Commentary""."
Lisa,"Ohh, poor Mr. Costner. He tries so hard."
Lisa,Uh... Where are you?
Lisa,"Yeah, if you want to change your image, you've got to get your face out there..."
Lisa,Oh! ... on the radio.
Lisa,"Oh, I think this really sucks."
Lisa,"Thank you. Mm. For low-fat, this pudding's pretty good."
Lisa,Unbelievable! We're rewarding people for acting like buffoons!
Lisa,A pie.
Lisa,"Oh, this is so embarrassing."
Lisa,You.
Lisa,"Okay, I'm leaving."
Lisa,"People, stop! Stop! We're not animals!"
Lisa,"An Open Letter to the People of Springfield: Today our town lost what remained of its fragile civility, drowned in a sea of low-fat pudding."
Lisa,You won second place?
Lisa,"We are a town of low-brows, no-brows and ignorami. We have eight malls but no symphony, thirty-two bars but no alternative theater, thirteen stores that begin with ""Le Sex..."" I write this letter not to nag or whine, but to prod! We can better ourselves!"
Lisa,"Well, most of us."
Lisa,"Dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?"
Lisa,"Dad, stop kidding around. Look, they printed my letter."
Lisa,"Well, I'm sure someone had the time to read it."
Lisa,"Hi, Mr. Flanders, I see you're reading the newspaper."
Lisa,"Chief Wiggum! Oh, you sure got a lotta copies of the paper."
Lisa,Doesn't anybody in this town read?
Lisa,"Oh, absolutely! Well, you know, anything by Jane Austen..."
Lisa,"""We read your letter with great interest. If you wish to learn more, go to 13 Euclid Street. Tell no one! And bring a dessert."""
Lisa,I think so.
Lisa,I know that. It's also a constellation visible only from the southern hemisphere.
Lisa,"You want me to join Mensa? Oh, that's wonderful. But don't I have to take some sort of I.Q. test?"
Lisa,Aren't those supposed to be confidential?
Lisa,Wow! I'm so honored you wanted me.
Lisa,Oh. What do you produce?
Lisa,"But ""rise to vote sir"" is a palindrome."
Lisa,Wow. Me... fit in.
Lisa,"My family never talks about library standards. And every time I try to steer the conversation that way, they make me feel like a nerd."
Lisa,See DOS. See DOS run. Run DOS run. Only one person in a million would find that funny.
Lisa,"Oh Dad, I just spent the day with the most wonderful people."
Lisa,"Well, for the first time in my life I feel that someone understands..."
Lisa,This is so cool. I feel like I'm back in the Renaissance.
Lisa,Someone should stand up to them.
Lisa,"No, we should fix things here. If we put our minds to it, there's no limit to what we can accomplish."
Lisa,"Please stay calm, everyone."
Lisa,Done!
Lisa,"Well, there's no one more learned than us..."
Lisa,"With our superior intellects, we could rebuild this city on a foundation of reason and enlightenment. We could turn Springfield into a utopia!"
Lisa,"No, Kent. We're gonna use the power of good ideas to change things for the better..."
Lisa,"Oh, well, we really mean it."
Lisa,"Okay, next item of business is our weekly progress report. Principal Skinner? How's your transportation project coming?"
Lisa,Excellent. Now next week is our state of the city address. Has everyone finalized their proposals?
Lisa,"Welcome, everyone. Today we embark on a new era of intelligent governance."
Lisa,I don't remember discussing that.
Lisa,What are you doing here?
Lisa,Help!
Lisa,"Da-ad! Oh, Dr. Hawking. We had such a beautiful dream. What went wrong?"
Lisa,Even you?
Lisa,"Wow, Mom. That's very profound."
Lisa,"Dad, it's not..."
Lisa,"This is ""Wired."" It's about computers and technology."
Lisa,"Hey look, there's a cyber-cafe opening right here in Springfield! Will you take me, Dad? Please? I'll show you how to order pizza over the Internet..."
Lisa,Bart! The Internet is more than a global pornography network. It's a...
Lisa,"Wow, Dad, you're surfing like a pro."
Lisa,"Dad, that's Fox!"
Lisa,"Dad, do we have any money left?"
Lisa,"Eww, we're gonna do our grocery shopping at a 99-Cent Store?"
Lisa,"Um, according to the Mexican Council of Food, this expired two years ago."
Lisa,This also says it can cause red tide poisoning.
Lisa,I don't think there's enough here for a vacation.
Lisa,"No, no, we're going to Paris. I can feel it."
Lisa,Never mind. Looks like the Flanders' are gonna get those seats anyway.
Lisa,Yay! The Simpsons are going to Japan!
Lisa,"Look Mom, the safety instructions are written in haiku. ""Fasten seatbelts tight / Your seat cushions float gently / Headsets five dollars."""
Lisa,It's breathtaking.
Lisa,"Look, there's the Imperial Gardens... the Meiji shrine... the Hello Kitty factory..."
Lisa,Who's up for some exploring?
Lisa,What the--?
Lisa,Me too. Let's go to an authentic Japanese noodle house!
Lisa,"Dad, we didn't come halfway around the world to eat at AmericaTown."
Lisa,Don't you serve anything that's even remotely Japanese?
Lisa,But you promised me we'd do something Japanese.
Lisa,Now can we do something Japanese?
Lisa,"Oh, it's beautiful, Dad."
Lisa,Yipee! Time for the company loyalty song!
Lisa,I think we all had that idea.
Lisa,"Oh sorry, Dad, we didn't know."
Lisa,"Well, Maggie weighs a lot less than... oh, I'll just go."
Lisa,Yes! Got 'em!
Lisa,"I'm proud of you, Dad. Buying an electric car will help clean the air up and protect the Earth's supply... You're faking this to get the gift, aren't you?"
Lisa,"Ah! Dad, you're headed for the harbor!"
Lisa,"Bart, don't..."
Lisa,"But, Dad, I thought you hated..."
Lisa,"Stop doing that, Mom."
Lisa,But my Dad can...
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, what would you say is the most important firefighting tool? Would you say it's prevention?"
Lisa,You've really done it this time.
Lisa,Ewww. Mom!
Lisa,Bart! Bart! Krusty just fired his associate producer!
Lisa,"No way... ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Pre-Teens?"" Is this all because of the...?"
Lisa,Are you standing up to get me to leave?
Lisa,"Hey! I'm not a ""Time Burglar!"""
Lisa,"All right, I'll go! You don't have to be a jerk about it."
Lisa,I'm so glad you're here. Bart's really acting funny.
Lisa,You'll see...
Lisa,"Who are ""they,"" exactly?"
Lisa,"Oh, Bart, what's happened to you?"
Lisa,Aagghh!
Lisa,"Dad, that junkie is your son!"
Lisa,It's good to have the old Bart back. Plus you exposed the disturbing unreadiness of today's Army.
Lisa,Why is the zero made out of glass?
Lisa,"Dad, it's great that you volunteered to drive -- but how did you get out of work?"
Lisa,"Dad, that's an ambulance."
Lisa,"Wow, a bustling metropolitan newsroom, funnelling scoops from all over the globe."
Lisa,And what per cent is that?
Lisa,"Dad, I'm sorry the editor didn't like your review."
Lisa,I'll help you write a new review if you just let me use the bathroom!
Lisa,"Well, we went to Paté Labelle last week. How 'bout that?"
Lisa,The food is delicious.
Lisa,Hm. What's the English equivalent for ? I'd say... transcendent.
Lisa,"Uh, I don't think so."
Lisa,497... 498 words. Hmph.
Lisa,Bon Appetit.
Lisa,"Wow, my first published article. Although someone else's name is on it."
Lisa,"And there's the cane from ""Citizen Kane."" Wait a minute. There was no cane in ""Citizen Kane."""
Lisa,The food is exquisite...
Lisa,"Dad, that's so mean."
Lisa,But what if someone bad tells me to...
Lisa,"Dad, you're being cruel for no reason -- what will people think?"
Lisa,Not anymore. I don't wanna be partners with a man who feels like that.
Lisa,I'm reviewing the festival for our school paper.
Lisa,We can find him faster by splitting up. You take fried foods. You take salty snacks. I'll take desserts. Break!
Lisa,"Dad, no!"
Lisa,It's gonna kill you!
Lisa,Don't! Uh... um... It's low-fat!
Lisa,What bad things? Why?
Lisa,"Uh, Dad?"
Lisa,I still can't believe we escaped from those horrible vampires.
Lisa,We've got to go to the police.
Lisa,He's getting closer!
Lisa,So you were going to kill us.
Lisa,I don't think the real Radioactive Man wears a plastic smock with a picture of himself on it.
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,"Hold the funeral, Poindexter."
Lisa,"Bart, with these powers, we can become superheroes!"
Lisa,I don't think so!
Lisa,"Your collecting days are over, Collector..."
Lisa,Stretch Dude! Help!
Lisa,"Bart, just let me drop and save yourself!"
Lisa,"Wait a minute, Xena can't fly."
Lisa,Oh.
Lisa,"You did fix them, right Dad? Because even a single faulty unit could corrupt every other computer in the world."
Lisa,It's got a computer chip in it. Everything does.
Lisa,"Well, look at the wonders of the computer age now."
Lisa,I think that was implied by what I said.
Lisa,"Mom, make him stop."
Lisa,They're evacuating the Earth! We're saved!
Lisa,They must be starting a new civilization on Mars with our best and brightest.
Lisa,"Actually, he's Homer Simpson. That's Bart. I'm Lisa..."
Lisa,Mom.
Lisa,Do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?
Lisa,No it isn't. It's totally inaccurate--
Lisa,"The National Weather Service says dawn is still scheduled for six-twenty tomorrow, and to please stop calling."
Lisa,Where are we gonna live?
Lisa,That has people living in it. You can see them through the windows.
Lisa,"Could you build us a house, President Carter? We can't go back to ours."
Lisa,"Where are we going, Dad?"
Lisa,Are we really gonna live here and grow crops?
Lisa,I'll weed the floor.
Lisa,"Oh, you poor little sheep! No one's sheared you for years!"
Lisa,"All right. Almost done, my little friend. Soon you'll be a nice, cool... RAT?!"
Lisa,No thanks. I'm still finishing my thistles.
Lisa,"Wait, Dad, you don't have to kill yourself."
Lisa,Something's growing.
Lisa,Maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.
Lisa,I thought you said it tasted terrible.
Lisa,"""ToMacco?"" That's pretty clever, Dad. I mean, for a product that's evil and deadly."
Lisa,"Dad, it's a tobacco company. They make billions off the suffering and deaths of others."
Lisa,"No, I..."
Lisa,You're about to launch a terrible evil on the world. You've gotta destroy this plant.
Lisa,Just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
Lisa,Now you can't tell me nicotine's not addictive.
Lisa,"Dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for."
Lisa,Not Lenny!
Lisa,"Hey, there was no accident at the plant. Dad just wanted to go bowling!"
Lisa,"Dad, what she's saying is you've had your moment in the sun and now it's time for you to gracefully step aside."
Lisa,"Sure! You can help me find three words where ""y"" is the vowel."
Lisa,"Ooh, I want to get the ""Kr_nk""!"
Lisa,"Mom, no! Everyone at school picks on the ""Pöpli"" kids. Even I do. I just hate them so much."
Lisa,"I became the most popular girl in school, but blew it by being conceited."
Lisa,You already saw them.
Lisa,How can he rebel? He doesn't even know where he is.
Lisa,Are those real cobras?
Lisa,Ew! These records used to be real accomplishments. Now they're just gross.
Lisa,What a neat idea!
Lisa,"""Allen Ginsburgers, Un-American Cheese Sandwich, Polio Dogs..."""
Lisa,"Dad, they have those everywhere."
Lisa,Answer to what?
Lisa,You keep it.
Lisa,"Dad, I'm tired of bathing in the yard. Plus, I think Rod and Todd are watching."
Lisa,And why aren't I at school?
Lisa,"Dad, there's a note on the back of your head."
Lisa,Korean Love Brides?!
Lisa,Are you okay?
Lisa,"Well, we could play Clam Traffic Jam... Or the game of County Seats!"
Lisa,"Aw, the zoning disk is warped..."
Lisa,I'll be in my room.
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, I thought public schools were required to have access ramps for the disabled."
Lisa,Bart broke all my books.
Lisa,"Oh, a name with ""fun""? Um... Fungus, Funzo, Attila the Fun..."
Lisa,"Uh, just a few Venn diagrams."
Lisa,"The word is ""irony."""
Lisa,"Don't you think there's something weird going on here? We spent all day selecting fabric swatches, and then our guest speaker was ""Phil from Marketing""."
Lisa,That's not funny... Huh?
Lisa,They're spying on us. Why would they do that?
Lisa,"This broom closet is not what it seems. It's a secret surveillance room, guarded by a tiny, evil robot."
Lisa,"Listen, when you see what's inside this..."
Lisa,I don't understand. I could swear it was right here.
Lisa,That's the doll that attacked me!
Lisa,Funzo? I said that name in class.
Lisa,"Bart, they lied to us. Instead of giving us an education, they tricked us into designing a toy. Aren't you outraged?"
Lisa,Good. Saddle up the bikes.
Lisa,Get down. Security guard.
Lisa,The phone's not even plugged in!
Lisa,You people took advantage of trusting schoolchildren!
Lisa,Really?
Lisa,"Oh, brother."
Lisa,"I admit it's kind of cute, but it'll never take the place of Malibu Stacy."
Lisa,Did you see that?
Lisa,They must have programmed it to eliminate the competition.
Lisa,"Exactly. Come on, Bart, we've got to warn everyone."
Lisa,Boycott Funzo. He's a toy-killing machine!
Lisa,"Well, I guess that's it. Come Christmas Eve, there'll be a Funzo under every tree."
Lisa,Nobody! You're just gonna break into everyone's house and steal their favorite toy.
Lisa,"Dad, Dad, you're driving on the sidewalk."
Lisa,Joy to the world / the Lord is come. / Let Earth receive her King...
Lisa,Let ev-ry...
Lisa,Season's Greetings.
Lisa,Si-lent night...
Lisa,Ho-ly night...
Lisa,All is calm / All is bright / Round...
Lisa,Yes. The madness ends here.
Lisa,Your toy company is evil.
Lisa,Are you saying the end justifies the means?
Lisa,"No, Bart, he's right. I did oversimplify."
Lisa,Let's just agree that the commercialization of Christmas is at best a mixed blessing.
Lisa,Gary...
Lisa,"What's in the box, Mom?"
Lisa,She cleaned out the attic!
Lisa,/ Push! /
Lisa,See Mom? You conquered your fears and now you're ready to sk--
Lisa,"So hard, but so rewarding... Downhill skiers missing fun... Oh, who am I kidding?"
Lisa,"Wow, what a perfect scene. This was so worth it..."
Lisa,"Don't worry, little friends. I won't hurt you."
Lisa,Eep.
Lisa,But they were trying to eat me!
Lisa,But they...
Lisa,"Hey, Mom!"
Lisa,Have you been in here all day?
Lisa,"No they won't. We'll all pitch in on the housework, right guys? Guys...?"
Lisa,"Oh, Mom. I've seen what you do around the house, and I can handle it. Maybe I can even make things more efficient."
Lisa,"Dad, where are your clothes?"
Lisa,Don't tell me Mom dresses you.
Lisa,"Okay, now we're gonna draw jobs from the chore hat."
Lisa,"You know, the reason for the hat..."
Lisa,Will you at least do the dishes?
Lisa,Oh! You're gonna be late.
Lisa,Here are your lunches. And no trading your fruit for firecrackers.
Lisa,"You stay away from Lenny. And where's your sweater, Bart?"
Lisa,Those boys of mine.
Lisa,"Okay, guys, dinner's ready..."
Lisa,"Oop, the cheese isn't quite melted. Let me just pop it back in the..."
Lisa,Here you go.
Lisa,Slivered almonds for the green beans! I'll be right back.
Lisa,"So, how was your day?"
Lisa,"Bart, you were supposed to scour the pans!"
Lisa,You said that four days ago.
Lisa,"Look, they're rusted through."
Lisa,No it's not!
Lisa,Good. Maple soda?... A cell phone full of candy?... Astronaut bread?
Lisa,"Dad, I gave you a list!"
Lisa,"Hey Mom, how's the leg?..."
Lisa,"Oh, couldn't be better."
Lisa,So Mom... You think you'll be getting out of there soon?
Lisa,"I really thought I could handle this, but..."
Lisa,Will you guys turn that thing down?
Lisa,"Stupid, inconsiderate bunch of jerks... I can't believe, after I..."
Lisa,Lucy?
Lisa,What are you doing here?
Lisa,Will this do?
Lisa,You mean like when you hid inside the conga drum to scare Ricky?
Lisa,"Ohh, I don't like the looks of this."
Lisa,We better check with a doctor.
Lisa,Let's see... Crusty sores...
Lisa,... Horrible wailing...
Lisa,Any exposure to unsanitary conditions?
Lisa,"Okay, and... ""diagnose""."
Lisa,Excellent.
Lisa,"Now guys, leprosy thrives in filthy conditions, so your only chance is to clean up the house. I'll get you a couple of mops."
Lisa,"Lazy, no-good lepers... Making me clean everything myself..."
Lisa,"No, he isn't. I don't know where he is."
Lisa,He told us he'd been going to the gym.
Lisa,"Mom, I lost Dad and Bart."
Lisa,I tricked them into thinking they had leprosy.
Lisa,"Well, Dad and Bart ran away and no one seems to know where they went."
Lisa,You mean Hawaii?
Lisa,"Dad, Bart, I played a horrible trick on you and I'm really sorry. You don't have leprosy. It's just oatmeal."
Lisa,"Dad, you only took one course."
Lisa,You went to Springfield U. You hate A & M.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"Bart, I hope you don't believe your own hype."
Lisa,"How can you believe all this mumbo-jumbo? The bucket came off Dad's head because the bright lights heated it, causing the metal to expand."
Lisa,What have you got so far?
Lisa,"That's nice, but maybe your Homecoming float should have something to do with college."
Lisa,I think Godzilla's bigger than Superman.
Lisa,Do we have any food that wasn't brutally slaughtered?
Lisa,They'll have tabouleh.
Lisa,"Uh, Dad has the worst luck when he's drinking."
Lisa,Bart did it! And they're gonna try for a field goal.
Lisa,You won a Grammy.
Lisa,"Wow, he's got every Nancy Drew! Even the controversial ""Clue in the Clock."" So many swears."
Lisa,I'm Princess Margaret!
Lisa,Mom! Bart's making faces at me. I think.
Lisa,But housesitting is a sacred...
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,"Don't worry, Mom. I'm sure he'll be okay."
Lisa,Why are we cleaning this room? I don't think we were even in here.
Lisa,It looks great. I can't believe we scrubbed that old man smell out of a hundred and thirty-seven rooms.
Lisa,"Ah, it's good to be home."
Lisa,"I hate to be a killjoy, but do you really think we can win playing ""Stars and Stripes Forever""? It's so beginner band, and we're advanced beginner band."
Lisa,"Well, I thought maybe, for once, we could play a song that wasn't written by Sousa."
Lisa,"No, something fresh and bold."
Lisa,Take your arm off me.
Lisa,Anybody got a building permit? 'Cause we nailed it!
Lisa,"""Stars and Stripes Forever""? Oh, man. They're toast!"
Lisa,Glow sticks? But visual aids are against the rules!
Lisa,"I hope you enjoy your plaque, cheater."
Lisa,I can't believe those idiot judges were impressed by glowing plastic tubes.
Lisa,You mean State Un-fair.
Lisa,Dear Mr. President
Lisa,"I'm writing a letter to President Clinton about that travesty of a band contest. As a fellow sax player, I'm sure he'll be outraged."
Lisa,"Really -- Hey, what are you doing?"
Lisa,"Hello, I'd like to speak to President Clinton, please. I wrote to him and he never wrote back... No, I don't want Al Gore!"
Lisa,Is that Duncan?
Lisa,"Ew, you used my bracelet for a nose ring!"
Lisa,"Thank you, Mr. President!"
Lisa,"Mom, I think you might be developing a gambling problem."
Lisa,You read my letter?
Lisa,"Now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we found it. Everything we pack in, we pack out."
Lisa,Use this plastic bag.
Lisa,"Ah, we're so lucky to have this untouched piece of paradise so close to Springfield."
Lisa,That doesn't sound like bees.
Lisa,The Bird Sanctuary -- they ruined it!
Lisa,Why do jerks think everyone wants to see their stupid name?
Lisa,"That's very sweet, but we have a full day of hiking planned."
Lisa,Bite me.
Lisa,"Okay, I finished the gardening sequence."
Lisa,"Dad, there are other wipes besides star-wipes."
Lisa,I'm taking my name off this thing.
Lisa,"Hey, isn't that the bass player from ""Satanica""?"
Lisa,"Mom, Dad's on PBS!"
Lisa,Agreed.
Lisa,Microatia? That's twelve thousand miles away.
Lisa,Dad?
Lisa,I just want to tell you how proud I am that you're showing an interest in your fellow man.
Lisa,"Oh, no!"
Lisa,What do I save?!
Lisa,Trophies! Trophies! Attendance!
Lisa,"Oooh, there's Ulysses S. Grant, Babe Ruth Ben Franklin..."
Lisa,Ewwww.
Lisa,"Those balloons won't biodegrade for ten thousand years. And if Bart gets a wowwipop, I want a wowwipop."
Lisa,"Yeah, wish I could be entertained by two cents worth of rubber, shaped like some colorful animal, dancing and twirling, dancing and twirling..."
Lisa,"Hey, gimme that! / That's mine!"
Lisa,The door!
Lisa,I hope they're hover-bikes.
Lisa,I'm trying! Can't I get on your shoulders?
Lisa,Stop kicking me!
Lisa,It's going into that building.
Lisa,Excuse me. We just came to get our balloon.
Lisa,"Thank you. ""A gay president in 2084""?"
Lisa,I don't know if I'll be able to accept Moe as Dr. Tad Winslow.
Lisa,How much farther to the campground?
Lisa,"Ah, something troubles me about Indian gaming. On the one hand, the revenue helps the tribes..."
Lisa,"Excellent question. Yes, I am proud to be America's first straight female President. Helen?"
Lisa,"Yes. Yes you were. Now, in conclusion, my administration will focus on the three R's: Reading, 'Riting and Refilling the ocean. Thank you very much."
Lisa,"As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump. How bad is it, Secretary Van Houten?"
Lisa,The country is broke? How can that be?
Lisa,What about my pledge to build the world's largest bookmobile? Isn't there any money left for that?
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,"Let him up, please."
Lisa,What are you doing here?
Lisa,Co-President? Are you crazy?
Lisa,"Sorry I'm late. I've been racking my brain, trying to think of something to cut from the budget."
Lisa,"Hey, where's Maggie?"
Lisa,Appointed a Supreme Court Justice.
Lisa,"Dad, that's just a myth. Lincoln didn't hide any gold in the White House."
Lisa,"Hey, that's my helicopter!"
Lisa,"Bart, you do not send a billion-dollar helicopter to pick up your drinking buddy."
Lisa,"No, I didn't."
Lisa,"I am proud to honor the players of the Negro Leagues of Rollerball. And as we strive for the desegregation of all deathsports, we cannot help but be inspired by..."
Lisa,"Bart, get out of here!"
Lisa,I can't relax! Being president is hard work. Maybe you should try doing something with your life.
Lisa,Yeah. Did you even call about that messenger job?
Lisa,"If I'm gonna bail the country out... I'll have to raise taxes. But in my speech, I'd like to avoid calling it a ""Painful Emergency Tax."""
Lisa,"See, that has the same problem. We need to soften the blow."
Lisa,I love it!
Lisa,Fiscal solvency.
Lisa,"Not now, Bart. I'm about to speak to a hundred million people. This speech could make or break my presidency."
Lisa,Are you insane?
Lisa,"My fellow Americans, and voting illegal aliens: I will not mince words. Your country needs you. That's why today I am proposing a Temporary Refund Adjustment."
Lisa,The months ahead will be long and arduous. But it is only through arduousity th...
Lisa,"Uh, this is my brother Bart, who doesn't seem to realize this isn't the best time for his music. He's one of the people I want to help with my programs."
Lisa,"Goodnight, America."
Lisa,Why you little...
Lisa,At Camp David? Sure. They couldn't keep pants on Kissinger.
Lisa,"Thanks a lot, Bart. All right, how can we pay off our foreign debt?"
Lisa,We don't own the shores of Tripoli.
Lisa,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Why don't we just invite our creditor nations here, and gently remind them of America's past generosity?"
Lisa,"Ooh, but Bart could screw everything up..."
Lisa,"No, just keep him out of my hair."
Lisa,No!
Lisa,"Bart, we're having a meeting."
Lisa,I have a lot of meetings. I'm the President.
Lisa,"You know something, Bart? You're right. My lack of coolness is really holding America back."
Lisa,"You're too much, Bart. That's why I'm appointing you ""Secretary Of Keeping It Real."""
Lisa,Absolutely. I want you and your pals to go away to Camp David and write up a report on coolness.
Lisa,"Please, calm down. We can work something out."
Lisa,"Bart, you're supposed to be at Camp David."
Lisa,"Thanks Bart, you bought us some time. What can I do to thank you?"
Lisa,"Legalize what? Oh, oh. Consider it done."
Lisa,"There you are. Come on, we have to go. Dad pushed a waitress. And Mom lost twenty thousand dollars."
Lisa,Really? Anything good?
Lisa,What about me?
Lisa,"Mr. Gumbel, you're upsetting me."
Lisa,"Did Gaga just say ""hurt everyone""?"
Lisa,It does?
Lisa,"Well, it shouldn't be too hard to beat the old photo."
Lisa,Hmmm.
Lisa,And it's still got a roll of film in it.
Lisa,"Bart, we need that to win the contest."
Lisa,That picture's a cliché .
Lisa,"Now, when the mama bird returns to feed her babies, we'll have a prize-winning picture."
Lisa,Is that Rainier Wolfcastle?
Lisa,"Okay, that's it... looks good... Oh, Bart, the bulldog didn't ante!"
Lisa,"Okay, on three. One... two..."
Lisa,Hey! No fair! We'll never get a good picture.
Lisa,"Boy, you can see everything from Mount Springfield. The Squidport, the old monorail..."
Lisa,"Ow! Bart, that's hot!"
Lisa,Ow!
Lisa,"Dad, help!"
Lisa,"No, you saved our lives."
Lisa,What?
Lisa,All right! / Cool! / Lemme see!
Lisa,"Well, at least we won the bike."
Lisa,What? / How could you?
Lisa,"Dad, those are just the names of the quizzes. You're supposed to open the magazine."
Lisa,Why don't you be the quizmaster and ask other people the questions?
Lisa,"Some of us have grammar school in the morning, you know."
Lisa,Mom! Bart's sitting next to me!
Lisa,"Oh, no! We came during Spring Break!"
Lisa,Look at the size of that gator!
Lisa,ROCK AND ROLL.
Lisa,"You can't drive, Dad. He's got your license."
Lisa,"Dad, what do we do?!"
Lisa,"Hey, where is Dad?"
Lisa,"Not really, no."
Lisa,Ewww.
Lisa,"Wow, look at all the stars you can see here."
Lisa,"Too hot to bicker, I reckon."
Lisa,Got that right. / Durn tootin'. / Boy howdy.
Lisa,What should I do?
Lisa,Run!
Lisa,"North Dakota, here we come!"
Lisa,"Dad, I've got Maggie."
Lisa,It got rave reviews from both the Entertainment Radio Network and the Radio Entertainment Network. Let's go!
Lisa,"Oh, he'll never dance with her. She'll have to settle for some Mexican Milhouse."
Lisa,"That's my name with bella on the end of it. Ask her, oh God, please ask her to dance."
Lisa,"She's not plain, she's beautiful!"
Lisa,"Oh, Mom. I want to be a dancer!"
Lisa,"Well, I think World War II helped a little, Mom."
Lisa,"But I want to learn a dance I can use in real life, like the Tango de la Muerte."
Lisa,Nope.
Lisa,Sorry. The floor's kind of at an angle here. I'm gonna move over there.
Lisa,"What am I doing wrong, Little Vicki?"
Lisa,"Yeah, well, no offense, but maybe I need a little more instruction than just tap-a-tap-a-tap-a."
Lisa,Sorry. I'm just frustrated.
Lisa,"I'm just walking. Listen, I know I said I wanted to be a dancer, but..."
Lisa,But I just... need more practice. See ya!
Lisa,It's me!
Lisa,The cat dances better than I do.
Lisa,Why?
Lisa,Excuse me...
Lisa,Why isn't my name in the program?
Lisa,Curtain puller?!
Lisa,But my parents are counting on seeing me dance! And I've worked ever so hard.
Lisa,"All right, I'll be the stupid curtain puller."
Lisa,I get your pull-a-pull-a-pull-a...
Lisa,"Most entertaining, but how does that help me?"
Lisa,"Ohhhhhh. That's brilliant, Professor! What will you think of next?"
Lisa,I've gotta go now.
Lisa,"Little Vicki, I figured out how to dance. I can be in the show now!"
Lisa,"But, but you don't understand..."
Lisa,Yes?!
Lisa,I can't help it! It's the shoes!
Lisa,"Oh, please stop!"
Lisa,Stop clapping!
Lisa,"Oh, thanks, Dad."
Lisa,"I'm sorry, Vicki. I just wanted to be a dancer so badly."
Lisa,You mean I danced all by myself?
Lisa,"Forget it, Dad. I guess I'm never gonna be your Broadway Baby."
Lisa,You think so?
Lisa,"Oh, I love you guys."
Lisa,"Bart, quit it!"
Lisa,Bart sleeps with Raggedy Andy.
Lisa,"Oh, Mom, you're not supposed to throw rice anymore. Birds eat it, their stomachs swell and they explode."
Lisa,They're pigs?
Lisa,"Dad, the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake!"
Lisa,Thank you.
Lisa,"Moe, can I give you some shrimp for the road?"
Lisa,"Well, Mom, you really brought out the mung in these beans."
Lisa,"We're jamming, Mom. She's painting my music, and I'm playing to her painting."
Lisa,Isn't it wonderful to have a hip female influence in the house?
Lisa,It's my favorite!
Lisa,"C'mon, Becky. Tell us your big news."
Lisa,"Awww. / Oh, no."
Lisa,Poor Maggie. How many insanity hearings have you been to in your short little life?
Lisa,Shouldn't we be out there trying to find her?
Lisa,"Oh, I really miss Mom."
Lisa,"And I'm directing the ""Making Of"" video."
Lisa,"I had no business hosting the Oscars. After the show, Meryl Streep spit on me."
Lisa,Sheriff Lowbrow...
Lisa,"Dad, that's too much deterge--"
Lisa,It was amazing how fast Dad betrayed his vision of a realistic show.
Lisa,"Shut up all of you, or I'll sue."
Lisa,"Suddenly, I was invited to every birthday party. Sometimes I'd have to read the cake just to know who I was singing to."
Lisa,None of us had ever sung before. But Mr. Geffen believed in us.
Lisa,Wow...
Lisa,"It was such an honor to be on the Walk of Fame. I mean, there we were with Hollywood royalty, like Milton Berle and Nelson Mandela."
Lisa,"We were earning millions, but we were always strapped for cash."
Lisa,"Dad, I want to go to bed. Aren't there child labor laws?"
Lisa,"Right from the start, I had a bad feeling about that gig."
Lisa,What kind of song should we play?
Lisa,Swings!
Lisa,Swings!
Lisa,"Folks, we're just having a little family tiff. If you'll just bear with us..."
Lisa,"Oh, that's it!"
Lisa,"To prolong the run of the series, I was secretly given anti-growth hormones."
Lisa,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
Lisa,So this whole thing was just a trick to get us back together.
Lisa,I wanna see Wilmington!
Lisa,"It really says ""die""? That sounds unusually specific for a horoscope."
Lisa,Ow! Son of a...
Lisa,But these fairy tales take me away from the harsh reality of peasant life.
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,Face it -- they're not great parents.
Lisa,No! That bridge has a troll under it!
Lisa,Everything in this forest is from a fairy tale! And this book can keep us one step ahead!
Lisa,"Hmm... Bowls of porridge... Oh, this seems somehow familiar... Let's see..."
Lisa,We're in The Three Bears house!
Lisa,I wonder where Goldilocks was.
Lisa,"Wait, let me check the book."
Lisa,You're probably right.
Lisa,"Oh, this is horrible!"
Lisa,You know she's only fattening you up so she can eat you.
Lisa,"Well, at least stop basting yourself!"
Lisa,"Yeah, right. / I'm sure. / Pffft."
Lisa,Oh yeah? What's his name?
Lisa,George Cauldron? Maybe he can fix me up with Ed Ladle.
Lisa,"Father, I knew you'd rescue us!"
Lisa,"Oh, Snorky..."
Lisa,"It's okay, they're gone now. You can..."
Lisa,"Hey, where are you going?"
Lisa,"Oh, you want to be with your friends."
Lisa,Go on! Swim to freedom! Go!
Lisa,Killer dolphins?
Lisa,Plus all that sewage we keep dumping.
Lisa,"Oh, no. You poor thing. Here..."
Lisa,"I kinda wish I hadn't freed their leader and, you know... doomed mankind."
Lisa,"Well, according to WhatBadgersEat.Com, ""Badgers subsist primarily on a diet of stoats, voles and marmots."""
Lisa,"Stoats are weasels, Bart. They don't come in cans."
Lisa,"That says ""corn,"" Bart."
Lisa,"Here we are. ""In a pinch, badgers have even been known to eat woodpeckers."""
Lisa,"No, Dad! We don't want to kill him! Let's call animal control."
Lisa,How did the badger do that without ripping your shirt?
Lisa,"It's a movie, Dad."
Lisa,If you ask me...
Lisa,... it's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code. It would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight.
Lisa,Mom!
Lisa,I'm so conflicted.
Lisa,"Dad, you're bleeding."
Lisa,"Dad, the arena's in Olde Springfield."
Lisa,What's going on here?
Lisa,"Oh, yeah? You didn't blow up Maggie's room."
Lisa,You've ruined all my stuff.
Lisa,It is my birthday.
Lisa,"Well, the Book Festival starts today..."
Lisa,"Ms. Tan, I loved ""The Joy Luck Club"". It really showed me how the mother-daughter bond can triumph over adversity."
Lisa,But...
Lisa,"Catch, Dad, catch!"
Lisa,Dad! Dad!
Lisa,Daaaad!
Lisa,"I'm all for ethnic diversity, but this is just pandering."
Lisa,What a waste...
Lisa,"There you go, little fish."
Lisa,"Bart, do you know how many trees died to make those menus?"
Lisa,You're ruining the earth.
Lisa,Don't you call me a--
Lisa,"No, I think they're protesters."
Lisa,"No, you can't!"
Lisa,Are you all right?
Lisa,"Oh, you're so heroic."
Lisa,"Dad, change it back!"
Lisa,No I don't!
Lisa,Shut up!
Lisa,I'd like to visit a prisoner.
Lisa,Aren't you coming with me?
Lisa,Jesse?
Lisa,You do yoga?
Lisa,My name's Lisa Simpson. I think your protest was incredibly brave.
Lisa,"Oh, the earth is the best. That's why I'm a vegetarian."
Lisa,"Well, um, I was thinking of going vegan!"
Lisa,Wow. Um... I started an organic compost pile at home.
Lisa,"Oh, it's so decomposed! Do you think I could join Dirt First?"
Lisa,"Oh, thank you, thank you!"
Lisa,"You're welcome to come, too."
Lisa,"Mom, Dad, there's something I have to do. You're not gonna like it, but I really believe it's the right thing."
Lisa,"Oh, I didn't think it would be so high... Maybe I could just circulate a petition..."
Lisa,"Oh, I'll show you."
Lisa,"Well, this looks like a good place to set up camp."
Lisa,"Wow, what a view."
Lisa,Not so fast!
Lisa,I won't come down till you spare this tree!
Lisa,It's Lisa!
Lisa,He said I was hard core.
Lisa,"It's okay, Mom! I have a safety line!"
Lisa,All right! A care bucket.
Lisa,"Hot Thai soup! Ohhh, Bart... ""Dear Lisa. You rock! Mom is calling rescue agencies. Dad is building a giant ladder, but it is of poor quality. We miss you, Bart."" Awww."
Lisa,"Oh, seven o'clock. The family's just sitting down to dinner."
Lisa,Awww.
Lisa,Now they're making popcorn...
Lisa,And hanging Christmas stockings!
Lisa,And coloring Easter eggs!
Lisa,"Oh, I can't take it! Would it be so bad if I just went home for an hour?"
Lisa,"Don't worry, I'll be right back."
Lisa,"Ew, someone's been marking their territory."
Lisa,"Hey, everybody! I..."
Lisa,Aww.
Lisa,I'll just rest here for a minute.
Lisa,"Ooh, it's morning. I gotta get back!"
Lisa,"Oh, no."
Lisa,"Oh Mom, those loggers chopped down the tree! Why did I have to leave my post?"
Lisa,"Lightning?! Well, at least it wasn't my fault."
Lisa,"Dad, I'm not dead!"
Lisa,He cut off his favorite dread!
Lisa,"No, Mom. It's a memorial forest now. If I'm alive, they'll cut it down!"
Lisa,"Dear Moe, if anything should ever happen to me, I want you to tear up my dad's tab, and pour cocktail onions... Dad, I can't--"
Lisa,... pour cocktail onions down your pants.
Lisa,Nooo!
Lisa,I'm not dead! And neither is my sense of moral outrage.
Lisa,"Sir, have you no shame?"
Lisa,"Aw, Jesse. They locked you up again."
Lisa,"Well, I'll write you letters. On rice paper, with a soy pencil!"
Lisa,Not yet.
Lisa,Just a cotton-pickin' minute. I've been getting A's since Gymboree.
Lisa,You gave Bart one.
Lisa,"Dad, what happened to the back seat?"
Lisa,"Thank you, Dad."
Lisa,Something's wrong. Terribly wrong.
Lisa,Dad?? The panda was you?
Lisa,"Oh, Dad."
Lisa,"So, this is your mysterious new job for Mr. Burns?"
Lisa,"Oh Dad, you have to stop."
Lisa,He doesn't want your dirty money.
Lisa,Not my Dad.
Lisa,"Dad, how can you put a price on your dignity?"
Lisa,Da-ad!
Lisa,"Forget about him, Dad. I'm proud of you."
Lisa,"Well, there's lots of needy kids out there..."
Lisa,"No, Dad. You could really brighten the holidays for those less fortunate."
Lisa,I'm so proud! My dad will be the grand finale of the Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Lisa,Something tells me he is.
Lisa,Pranksgiving? Uh-oh...
Lisa,"Oh, Dad. You sold your soul."
Lisa,"Dad! But if you're here, who's that on the float?"
Lisa,"Dad, you shouldn't drag that around."
Lisa,"Dad, I'll set up your computer. Why don't you and Bart go play in the back yard?"
Lisa,"Okay, you're ready to go. I've written down the basic commands so that anyone can understand them."
Lisa,Well... a web page is supposed to be a personal thing. You've just stolen copyrighted material from everyone else. They could sue you for that.
Lisa,Mom wants you to come to bed.
Lisa,"You have to offer people something: a joke, an opinion, an idea..."
Lisa,You can't post that on the Internet. You don't even know if it's true.
Lisa,"I'm happy you got the potholes filled, but it's still irresponsible to present rumors as facts. Maybe you should quit while you're ahead."
Lisa,"Well, you can't post news if you don't have any."
Lisa,At least take off your Pulitzer Prize when you say that.
Lisa,"Oh, Dad..."
Lisa,Can I turn this off?
Lisa,"Yes, the island."
Lisa,Are you really gonna drink that?
Lisa,"Mom, you're missing a great show."
Lisa,"Wow, Mom got a laugh."
Lisa,What happened to Mom?
Lisa,That's a party magic college.
Lisa,Ya-huh!
Lisa,Ya-huh!
Lisa,It looks like a sturgeon.
Lisa,How'd you do your act? You left your magic kit here.
Lisa,"I dunno, Mom. I think they're up to something..."
Lisa,Is that a Long Island Iced Tea?
Lisa,What did he look like?
Lisa,Anything else?
Lisa,We did.
Lisa,"Nice work, everybody!"
Lisa,"I know it seems farfetched, even insulting to your intelligence. But, there's a simple and highly satisfying explanation. You see..."
Lisa,The Cirque de Purée. We've had tickets since Septembre.
Lisa,"As French Canadians, they don't believe in refunds, or exploiting animals for entertainment."
Lisa,They made an elephant!
Lisa,"Look, the Sea Captain's all hunkered down."
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,This couldn't have less to do with Christmas! And I think that's a stagehand.
Lisa,"No, Bart. For all we know, hundreds of rescue workers are digging us out right now."
Lisa,"""Lisa is an outstanding student, with a slight tendency toward know-it-all-ism."" That's not even a word!"
Lisa,It sounded like a silo tipping over!
Lisa,And the exhaust pipe is leaking.
Lisa,"Wait, I'm confused. Why was a wolf shooting a web?"
Lisa,"Excuse me, but isn't that voice very similar to the Cowardly Lion?"
Lisa,"Well maybe if Mom didn't make such dry waffles. There, I said it!"
Lisa,It is!
Lisa,It's true!
Lisa,I'd love to go to the library with you.
Lisa,"Dad, did you read all these books today?"
Lisa,I always dreamed you'd be my library buddy.
Lisa,"No, really. I think books have an amazing power to bring people together. Look, even Cletus is checking one out."
Lisa,"Dad, as intelligence goes up, happiness often goes down. In fact, I made a graph."
Lisa,I make a lot of graphs.
Lisa,"Oh, many things: Tai Chi, Chai Tea... But I find, when I can't keep the unhappy thoughts from swirling in my brain, the best thing is usually a nice long walk."
Lisa,"Ah, now for a little powder blue."
Lisa,"Oh, no. He wouldn't!"
Lisa,"Dad, how could you? We were connecting in such a meaningful way."
Lisa,"Hey, what's this?"
Lisa,"""Lisa: I'm taking the coward's way out. But before I do, I just want you to know: Being smart made me appreciate how amazing you really are."""
Lisa,"Oh, Dad."
Lisa,I'm gonna wear my apron on the Fourth of July.
Lisa,Da-ad!
Lisa,"They are coming back for us, aren't they?"
Lisa,"How's your back, Dad?"
Lisa,"So, how was it in the slammer?"
Lisa,That scary guy?
Lisa,It's so passionate. It almost leaps off the wall.
Lisa,"You know what'd be good with these, is some Ms. Butterworth."
Lisa,Let's have a breakfast meeting.
Lisa,"Eww, how long has this baking soda been in here?"
Lisa,"I'll call poison control. Fran, it's me. Just a heads-up."
Lisa,Uh-oh. Dad's having an antacid trip.
Lisa,"Ooh, it says here that special effects whiz Tom Savini is gonna be appearing at the comic book store tonight!"
Lisa,"Milhouse, I'm impressed."
Lisa,The store is so busy. You and Bart are really great businessmen.
Lisa,"Tough break, toots. I need a man who answers to no one. A full manager."
Lisa,Practicing tennis.
Lisa,Especially bonnets.
Lisa,I don't know what this has to do with the Civil War.
Lisa,"Dad, you're just going through a classic oedipal anxiety. You remember the story of Oedipus, don't you?"
Lisa,Oedipus killed his father and married his mother.
Lisa,"I'm just saying you feel threatened by Bart, but it's all in your head."
Lisa,"Dad, I think you're overreacting."
Lisa,This session's over.
Lisa,Goodbye.
Lisa,Are you sure you want me to be your doubles partner?
Lisa,And you're not doing it out of spite?
Lisa,"Dad, I don't want to enter the tournament just to hurt Mom."
Lisa,What's so funny? I'm better than you.
Lisa,How would you know? Your backhand looks like a rusty gate.
Lisa,All we can do is play our very best.
Lisa,Venus Simpson? You're replacing me?
Lisa,Me neither. I'm just enjoying some world-class tennis.
Lisa,"The answer is ""bonbon""!"
Lisa,I can't believe Krusty's retiring. This is tragic!
Lisa,"Well, Dad, I think running's good exercise -- it adds years to your life."
Lisa,"You got all your equipment, Dad?"
Lisa,That's not Grampa. Dad's just dehydrated.
Lisa,"Wait, what was that?"
Lisa,"Mommm, can't Bart get his massage somewhere else?"
Lisa,What does it mean?
Lisa,There's something weird about this video...
Lisa,"No, something else..."
Lisa,Yvan eht nioj? They keep saying that.
Lisa,Uncle Sam? Let me play this backwards.
Lisa,They're recruiting people with subliminal messages!
Lisa,"Otto, what are you doing?"
Lisa,You're being brainwashed.
Lisa,"L.T., thank God you're here! The government's putting subliminal messages in your videos!"
Lisa,Is that a navy tattoo?
Lisa,Lieutenant Smash...
Lisa,"A wig! But, but your pant legs..."
Lisa,How could you soil the good name of Star Blitzzz Promotions?
Lisa,But you have recruiting ads on TV. Why do you need subliminal messages?
Lisa,Super-liminal?
Lisa,Cut it out! You're a grown man!
Lisa,"An aircraft carrier? Oh, that's subtle."
Lisa,Meh.
Lisa,M-E-H. Meh.
Lisa,"Okay, we have our choice of Rectangle Land, Cube Country or Squaresville."
Lisa,But you made it out of ham cubes.
Lisa,Ow! Ow!
Lisa,"It's okay, but it's missing a piece."
Lisa,Yaaayy!
Lisa,"Thank you, Dad."
Lisa,Great!
Lisa,"Thanks again, Dad."
Lisa,Bart's got a girlfriend!
Lisa,Bart's got a problem!
Lisa,There's all kinds of ways to get the public on your side. Bob Dylan wrote songs. Cesar Chavez staged hunger strikes.
Lisa,"Dad, I'm so proud of you. If you need some inspiration, here's a book of Mike Farrell's core beliefs."
Lisa,Why don't you just cook less?
Lisa,That ad campaign may have crossed a line.
Lisa,"But Mom, the school's right here."
Lisa,"Oh, it's tough being the new kid. Someone should go talk to her."
Lisa,Give her a break. Remember your first day at school?
Lisa,"Well, someone's gotta make her feel welcome."
Lisa,Hi there.
Lisa,My name's Lisa. What's yours?
Lisa,"Well, lots of people like jazz fusion..."
Lisa,"They're not dolls, they're aspiration figures. But it might work."
Lisa,"Uh, Francine? I think we got off to a bad start so... Hey!"
Lisa,"You like Malibu Stacey, too?"
Lisa,"And you like the same one I like -- with the Grad-student Glamour Pack... just like the one in my... ...locker. That's mine, isn't it?"
Lisa,How about jazz? Do you like jazz?
Lisa,"Milhouse? She got you, too?"
Lisa,Knock-knock...
Lisa,Would you bullies be interested in some bodyguard work?
Lisa,Well I'm gonna need full coverage -- my bully is highly aggressive. Check out these Indian burns.
Lisa,"Yeah, she's a real purist."
Lisa,Wow. There's so much I don't understand about bullying.
Lisa,Um-um.
Lisa,I just don't understand Francine's motivation.
Lisa,Why does she only go after the smart ones?
Lisa,Someone will. I'm gonna crack the bully code.
Lisa,"Willie, I need to see the school security tapes."
Lisa,It's hard to miss the cameras.
Lisa,Why does the school need to watch us all the time?
Lisa,"Ooh, here's the tape I need."
Lisa,How did she know I was there?
Lisa,"Hey, that time she looked right at me and didn't touch me."
Lisa,Hmm...
Lisa,Of course! The nose clip!
Lisa,"Hey Willie, I think I'm onto something! Check this out!"
Lisa,"Not talking, eh Willie? Just listen, then. I think I figured out what sets off that big ape Francine... Willie? Willie?"
Lisa,"Come on, people! Move it! I want to see some sweat!"
Lisa,I believe the key to bully-nerd antagonism lies in your drippings.
Lisa,"Excellent, now don't mind the squeegee."
Lisa,"Mr. Tatum, do you mind if I swab you with this damp rag?"
Lisa,Please? It's for science.
Lisa,Shh. It's working. Look.
Lisa,Yes!
Lisa,"I know, and the crowd is so distinguished. The inventor of the walkie-talkie is out there."
Lisa,"Third row, near the aisle."
Lisa,"My study is entitled ""Airborne Pheromones and Aggression in Bullies""."
Lisa,"For as long as there have been smart people, there have been bullies to prey on them. From Galileo...To Sir Isaac Newton...And even in the animal kingdom..."
Lisa,But why do the brawny prey on the brainy? Is it jealousy?
Lisa,No. The reason is chemical.
Lisa,"Please, Dr. Koop. Let me demonstrate."
Lisa,"This is my test subject, Francine."
Lisa,I'd like to thank her parents for helping with the caging.
Lisa,"I have isolated the chemical which is emitted by every geek, dork, and four-eyes. I call it ""Poindextrose""."
Lisa,"The bully has caught my scent, and she's at maximum rage. Professor Frink?"
Lisa,"Actually, it's just ordinary salad dressing."
Lisa,"The pungent vinegar and tangy Roquefort block the smell receptors, rendering the bully harmless."
Lisa,A gift certificate from J.C. Penney?
Lisa,"No, Dad! Didn't you listen to anything I said?"
Lisa,The repellent's all gone!
Lisa,My teacher said I need cupcakes. Cupcakes to learn.
Lisa,We need these because we have... to...
Lisa,There's gotta be something to eat in this house.
Lisa,"""Find the golden giraffe, and we'll send you and your family to Africa."""
Lisa,Yayyy!
Lisa,Africa looks like a beautiful jewel.
Lisa,"Hey, how ya doin' there? / Hi! / Hello. / Yo, Kitenge! What's going on?"
Lisa,Isn't that cute? A bush-baby.
Lisa,"No, Mom."
Lisa,When do we get to see the animals?
Lisa,"Hey, you didn't see a warthog!"
Lisa,Mom! Bart implied I was a warthog!
Lisa,"Wait, rhinos don't come from eggs."
Lisa,"I know, but..."
Lisa,"Oh, now come on..."
Lisa,That's terrible!
Lisa,I don't care. I hate them.
Lisa,"Hey, Mom."
Lisa,Look what Mbali gave me.
Lisa,No they don't. They--
Lisa,The left! Go to the left!
Lisa,"Oh, no! We're headed for Victoria Falls!"
Lisa,Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet?
Lisa,"Hello, little fella."
Lisa,This is the place I've read about! Where Dr. Bushwell lives among the chimps!
Lisa,"No, Dr. Bushwell is a woman."
Lisa,"Your work has really inspired me, Doctor. And I love your sensible ponytail."
Lisa,Oh no! It's the poachers!
Lisa,"Hey! Ah! Stop it, you creep!"
Lisa,Greenpeace?
Lisa,"Well, if you really cared about chimps, you'd know that Dr. Bushwell is their best friend."
Lisa,The chimps are running a diamond mine?!
Lisa,Dr. Bushwell!
Lisa,How could you exploit your beloved chimps like this?
Lisa,These are just pictures of monkeys from famous movies.
Lisa,Buzz off.
Lisa,"/ Oh, he got overthrown!"
Lisa,"I'll get us out of this. Say Dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?"
Lisa,"Meet Linguo, the grammar robot. I built him all by myself. If you misuse language, he'll correct you."
Lisa,"Dad, no!"
Lisa,This is why I can't have nice things.
Lisa,"I'll get us out of this. Say Dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?"
Lisa,"Dad, no!"
Lisa,This is why I can't have nice things.
Lisa,"Hang on, Linguo. You'll be up and conjugating in no time."
Lisa,"Quiet, please! Some of us are trying to weld! Almost done. Just lay still."
Lisa,I knew that. Just testing.
Lisa,Sentence fragment is also a sentence fragment.
Lisa,Just come on.
Lisa,"Uh-oh, the bus!"
Lisa,"Hey, stop! Wait! Oh, any day but science project day!"
Lisa,"Oh no! Somebody took my bike?! Mom, I need a ride to school."
Lisa,"Can you take me to school, Krusty?"
Lisa,"Thanks, Mr. Teeny!"
Lisa,Huh? This isn't Miss Hoover's class.
Lisa,What's happening? Where am I?
Lisa,West Springfield?
Lisa,I'm at the wrong school!
Lisa,Sorry. I was rushing because I'm in the wrong school. Can you believe that?
Lisa,You know about I.M. Pei? I.M. impressed.
Lisa,As in Monk?
Lisa,What do your friends call you?
Lisa,Just like me!
Lisa,"Oh my God, it's 11:15!"
Lisa,"We've been spinning for hours! I've got to get to my school and hand in Linguo. Oh, but I don't want to leave you."
Lisa,Will I ever see you again?
Lisa,Hmmm... It's noon -- that's about when Dad gets the brew-shakes.
Lisa,My Dad's not here? I need a ride to school.
Lisa,"Chief Wiggum, can you drive me to school? It's an emergency."
Lisa,That sounds like Fat Tony.
Lisa,Mom? Where'd you get that car?
Lisa,Can you take me to school? Please?
Lisa,I've gotta get to school.
Lisa,"Mom, I have to get to school. It's ten to three!"
Lisa,There's the school!
Lisa,"First place, here I come. Look out!"
Lisa,Look out!
Lisa,"...As the circulation returns, the subject prepares for a long and painful recovery."
Lisa,It's lucky for me that Legs was an experienced mob doctor.
Lisa,"Wow, look at all these flavors: Blessed Virgin Berry... Command-Mint... Biblegum..."
Lisa,There's nothing here.
Lisa,"Are you blushing, Mr. Flanders?"
Lisa,That was great. I can't believe she found a rhyme for Hezekiah.
Lisa,I thought you didn't like her.
Lisa,"We're the neighbors, and we don't think."
Lisa,Don't listen to him. You just have a good time at the eye doctor.
Lisa,"Bye, Mr. Flanders."
Lisa,Don't throw this away. It's Rod's first tooth.
Lisa,You said we were doing this out of friendship.
Lisa,It looks like an amusement park.
Lisa,How about asking the community for donations?
Lisa,He's speaking in tongues!
Lisa,"No, Dad! I think there's a leak in the line."
Lisa,Eight.
Lisa,So many times we've seen our father go under the knife.
Lisa,And I've got a rally for take back the afternoon.
Lisa,I've never seen the baby get tired of it before the adult.
Lisa,I can't remember the last time Dad sang us a torch song.
Lisa,What about us?
Lisa,They're always laughing. Laughing at nothing.
Lisa,I guess Dad just takes us for granted.
Lisa,It's my room!
Lisa,Night will come soon.
Lisa,"Well, I've been cutting the felt kinda crooked."
Lisa,Back to normal.
Lisa,We just spliced in some home movies. Whaddaya think?
Lisa,Yeah. / Pretty much.
Lisa,I wanna see Wilmington!
Lisa,Excuse me...
Lisa,"Paul Bunyan never fought Rodan. And his size seems to be really inconsistent. I mean, one minute he's ten feet tall, the next his feet are as big as a lake..."
Lisa,I'm just sayin'...
Lisa,Got any more tall tales?
Lisa,"Uhhh, could we hear another tall tale?"
Lisa,Don't forget apple sauce.
Lisa,That's not a tall tale. It's a book by Mark Twain.
Lisa,We're gonna visit the place where J.C. Penney sends their damaged merchandise.
Lisa,Mini toothpaste.
Lisa,Maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.
Lisa,"Ohh, let's try Matthew Perry!"
Lisa,Isn't that the voice that caused all those suicides?
Lisa,"No, Pierce Brosnan. A voice like his would give our house a much-needed touch of class."
Lisa,Soyghetti-O's!
Lisa,/ Wow.
Lisa,Ew!
Lisa,We have to disable its central processor! C'mon!
Lisa,"Dad, that's the water softener!"
Lisa,"There must be someone who can use a man around the house, even if he's slightly homicidal."
Lisa,Abraca-dairy!
Lisa,Five-minutes-more-ious!
Lisa,Hocus-croakus!
Lisa,"Bart, you're getting vomit on my prince. Head Zeppelin!"
Lisa,Release the dragon!
Lisa,Alakazai dragon fly!
Lisa,This isn't my wand. It's a Twizzler!
Lisa,"The Dark Lord Montymort, Absorber of Souls, Sucker of Essence!"
Lisa,"Help me, Bart!"
Lisa,"Bart, you saved me."
Lisa,"Bart, let's stop this stupid rivalry. Even if you never become a great sorcerer, you're still an okay brother."
Lisa,"Hey, Karie."
Lisa,Creative sentencing is common these days. That's why Bill Clinton is our new mailman.
Lisa,Ack!
Lisa,"Granted. But you gotta admit, constant supervision has been good for Bart. He might even make the honor roll, if Dad can control his night terrors."
Lisa,You are not.
Lisa,"Oh, poor Mom and Dad."
Lisa,"Do you think it's fair that you're always getting into trouble, yet Mom and Dad are being punished?"
Lisa,"Well, why don't you do something about it?"
Lisa,When are you gonna start taking responsibility for your actions?
Lisa,You're not even listening!
Lisa,That's my brother.
Lisa,"Judge Snyder? Motion to declare a writ of ""boys will be boys."""
Lisa,Woo hoo!
Lisa,We promise.
Lisa,Where's Bart? His Mountain Dew's getting flat.
Lisa,It's not a school project. I'd've heard of it. I'd better go check it out.
Lisa,What are you doing?
Lisa,Why?
Lisa,A hole for what?
Lisa,O-kay then.
Lisa,"You keep digging like this, you're gonna go straight through to China."
Lisa,This is pretty far to go just to spite Moe.
Lisa,Can we go to bed now?
Lisa,But you're not even using them.
Lisa,"Hunting? Dad, no!"
Lisa,"It's not fair, Dad. Why should an animal die just because you and Moe are fighting?"
Lisa,Do you really think the turkey's just gonna climb onto the plate?
Lisa,Moe?
Lisa,You don't like me? I like you.
Lisa,Dad's gonna slaughter that poor turkey!
Lisa,"You did it, Moe!"
Lisa,"Dad, you shot Moe!"
Lisa,"How'd they get your bar back to normal so quickly, Moe?"
Lisa,"I did. You owe REM an apology for, eco-fraud."
Lisa,"And we should all be thankful to Michael, Peter and Mike for supplying this beautiful turkey, made entirely of tofu."
Lisa,I love Chinatown... although I wish they'd stop picking on Tibet Town.
Lisa,How is the Feast of Twelve Delights with Triple Happiness Sauce?
Lisa,Then I'll have the sweet 'n' sour rice.
Lisa,"Neither, thank you."
Lisa,No!
Lisa,I don't know.
Lisa,"Some people enjoy being alone, Mom."
Lisa,That means Dad's not a kidnapper. He's a hostage.
Lisa,He did it! He saved her!
Lisa,"Well, the important thing is, they're both safe."
Lisa,I think it can.
Lisa,I came home as quick as I could. What's going on?
Lisa,You pulled me out of school for this?!
Lisa,"Mom, I believe you."
Lisa,Now you've done it. You really humiliated Mom.
Lisa,I suggest dinner and a show.
Lisa,"Dad, what's wrong?"
Lisa,"Well, the Yaqui Indians brew a special tea that unlocks memories."
Lisa,"No Dad, everyone's sick of that memory!"
Lisa,Try to remember back when you were twelve. Something frightening must have happened.
Lisa,We're trying to uncover a hidden trauma in my Dad's childhood.
Lisa,Murder most foul?
Lisa,"You know, if Dad never told anyone, that body must still be out there."
Lisa,"Stop saying that, Dad."
Lisa,"Hey, there's Mesmerino."
Lisa,We're investigating a possible murder case.
Lisa,We'll never find the body under all this water.
Lisa,"Hey, what's that over there?"
Lisa,And who sent it down that pipe?
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,Mr. Smithers' father!
Lisa,That's just a dog in a space suit.
Lisa,You know it is.
Lisa,"Well, at least it's tasteful."
Lisa,What are they doing to the church?
Lisa,I feel like I want to throw up.
Lisa,Why does Jesus have a lasso?
Lisa,That could not be more blasphemous.
Lisa,I am not gonna be taken in by all of this.
Lisa,That's it!
Lisa,"They should take a good look at themselves, and what their church has become!"
Lisa,Like the whore of Babylon?
Lisa,"No it's not, it's apt! Apt!"
Lisa,Don't you see what Mr. Burns has done to this church?
Lisa,"Those are all wonderful things. But they've cost the church its soul. And I, for one, will not be a part of it!"
Lisa,No! I'm leaving this church forever!
Lisa,"Lord, I'm not turning my back on You. I just need to find a temple that's free of corruption."
Lisa,"Mom, I know it's you."
Lisa,I can't believe you're eavesdropping on my prayers!
Lisa,"I still believe in God. I just think there's another path to Him, or Her."
Lisa,Yep.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"No! Look, I'm not just gonna pick a religion that seems cool. I'm gonna pick one that's right for me."
Lisa,I'm going out for a walk.
Lisa,Lenny and Carl?
Lisa,You guys are Buddhists?
Lisa,"Well, I'm looking for a new faith. One that isn't so materialistic."
Lisa,Richard Gere?
Lisa,"Mr. Gere, I was hoping Buddhism could bring me inner peace. Or is that just a pipe dream?"
Lisa,That would be so great.
Lisa,"""Nirvana is achieved through right views and right speech... Positive actions lead to happiness and negative actions lead to unhappiness... No creator gods, just the pursuit of enlightenment..."""
Lisa,I'm a Buddhist!
Lisa,"Hey, I'm a Buddhist!"
Lisa,"Mom, Dad, my spiritual quest is over..."
Lisa,I'm a Buddhist.
Lisa,A Buddhist wouldn't want any.
Lisa,"I'm planting my own Bodhi tree. If I meditate under it, perhaps I can find inner peace."
Lisa,No.
Lisa,Om Mani Padme Hung. Om Mani Padme Hung. Om Mani Padme Hung.
Lisa,"Well, they do smell good..."
Lisa,I just came down for a glass of water.
Lisa,"Well, Santa can take it back because I'm not ruled by material desi-- Is that a pony?"
Lisa,Awww...
Lisa,No!
Lisa,My family tried to trick me into celebrating Christmas!
Lisa,"Oh, sorry."
Lisa,Whaa?
Lisa,I can really celebrate Christmas?
Lisa,"Oh, I'll send you an email greeting card."
Lisa,Now I really should be getting back to my family.
Lisa,"Yeah, I wanted to spend Christmas with you guys."
Lisa,"No, I'm still Buddhist, but I can worship with my family too."
Lisa,Uh huh.
Lisa,"Thanks, Mom. Hey, where's my pony?"
Lisa,"I'm serious, make with the pony."
Lisa,"Here, Clip-Clop. Here pony, pony."
Lisa,"We've got Star Wars Monopoly, Rasta-mon-opoly, Galip-olopoly... Edna Krabappoly..."
Lisa,Pennsylvania Avenue. I wanna buy a house.
Lisa,"Hey, where'd they go?"
Lisa,These hotels are made of Legos.
Lisa,"Bart, you're cheating!"
Lisa,"Oh sure, you take his side. Just 'cause he bought you that house on St. James Place."
Lisa,"Mom, that's not how you pry them apart."
Lisa,And we carried it out as a family!
Lisa,"Thanks a lot, everybody. Now I'll never get into an Ivy League school."
Lisa,Take it back! Take it back!
Lisa,"Well, my room is my sanctuary. My family knows that and respects that."
Lisa,Just ten more years! / Just ten more years! / Just ten more years!
Lisa,Thank you.
Lisa,"Gabriel, are you okay?"
Lisa,"Look, we can't fall into old patterns. We've gotta think of a plan."
Lisa,"Fine, I'll talk like this."
Lisa,"Dad's on the log. Now Mom, you get the car and pull them to safety."
Lisa,"Now, Bart!"
Lisa,Could this be the end of our series... of events?
Lisa,Doesn't it bother you that you're breaking up our family?
Lisa,I'm eight years old.
Lisa,We had a good run.
Lisa,"I'm so sorry, Grampa."
Lisa,But I have to save them! The books no one buys get chopped up and fed to pigs.
Lisa,It was originally published to settle arguments in taverns.
Lisa,Francis of Assisi .
Lisa,Only on Mars.
Lisa,"Here, have one of my fudge-stuffed toaster pies."
Lisa,Mmm...
Lisa,Why don't you file a class-action suit?
Lisa,"That's okay, Mom. Today's law schools are churning out two point one lawyers for every person in America. Look."
Lisa,"We have to sign up plaintiffs, and take depositions from the townspeople."
Lisa,Is it really worth risking your lives just for some sugar?
Lisa,Godspeed.
Lisa,You do this every year. We are used to it.
Lisa,"Ooh, a salute to brunch! Wave to brunch, Maggie!"
Lisa,Why is this movie PG-13?
Lisa,These are so easy. It's obviously Tom Hanks.
Lisa,Who?
Lisa,Maybe we should try to calm Dad down.
Lisa,You wanna know what happened?
Lisa,Really?
Lisa,"We were playing four square, and I called no double taps, and Ralph double taps. And I said ""You're out"". And he says ""I can do a sum-ber-salt"" which has nothing to do with anything."
Lisa,Aww... maybe a hug will cork her cry-hole.
Lisa,"Thanks for listening, Dad."
Lisa,We gotta coordinate on this thing.
Lisa,"Dad, you've gotta do something."
Lisa,She could get hurt!
Lisa,I thought you liked the new Dad.
Lisa,She's not on drugs. She couldn't sleep because of Dad's chronic snoring.
Lisa,This is not a good time.
Lisa,"Mom, did you sleep well at your sisters'?"
Lisa,Mmmmm.
Lisa,"Hey, a helicopter's landing on our lawn!"
Lisa,"Hey, where's our parents?"
Lisa,He must have taken a job in the West Springfield oil patch. That's practically a death sentence!
Lisa,But West Springfield's three times the size of Texas. We'll never find him there.
Lisa,"""Springfield Preparatory School?!"" Dad, you told me there were no private schools in Springfield!"
Lisa,This school has everything.
Lisa,Their periodic table has two hundred and fifty elements!
Lisa,"You know, we could get equipment like this through a bond issue."
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, you're just stealing."
Lisa,"No, I belong here! Pleeeaaase!"
Lisa,I will not be a Gamecock!
Lisa,No!
Lisa,Nooo!
Lisa,"Bratwurst, sauerbraten, donderblitzen... Mom, isn't there anything vegetarian?"
Lisa,Greta called. It seems you told her you were sick.
Lisa,"Bart, this girl is in love with you. Think about it."
Lisa,"Well, if you don't feel the way Greta does, you've got to tell her before she gets hurt."
Lisa,"Well Bart, you really understand women."
Lisa,And where were you?
Lisa,"Oh, Bart, it's human nature. You only want her because someone else has her."
Lisa,"All right. Look, Maggie's not playing with this ball right now. But look what happens when I take it."
Lisa,See?
Lisa,"Maggie, what do you think?"
Lisa,"Dad, no. It says ""don't walk""!"
Lisa,You know that new baby brother Ralph's been bragging about? It's just a pinecone.
Lisa,Let's go where it's quiet.
Lisa,"I said ""let's go""."
Lisa,"Dad, it's a documentary on the homeless."
Lisa,"So Bart, when does the killing start?"
Lisa,I met one of my heroes today. She started the f--
Lisa,"Gee Buck, your old films are as violent as today's!"
Lisa,Why are you driving a car?
Lisa,I'm Annie Oakley!
Lisa,We also represent Billy Joel.
Lisa,Plus he'll work for scale.
Lisa,No one expects you to do anything difficult. They understand you're too old.
Lisa,You know what? I bet he can't even fit into his old costume.
Lisa,Texas.
Lisa,"Dad, I'm on the LINE."
Lisa,I'm really gonna miss him.
Lisa,Grampa!
Lisa,"Look Grampa, you're already getting a new neighbor."
Lisa,This game makes no sense.
Lisa,Give Grampa a chance. Statistics show that old people drive at least as well as sleep-deprived apes.
Lisa,"See you later, I'm going to the library."
Lisa,"Hey, I've earned their trust."
Lisa,He must have dropped this.
Lisa,But how? Branson is a thousand miles away and we've got no car.
Lisa,"Oh, that was lucky."
Lisa,"Well, how do we get to Branson?"
Lisa,"Mom, there's no gambling in Branson. It was designed as a family destination."
Lisa,"Look Mom, it's your car. Grampa and Bart must be in that theater!"
Lisa,"Mom, you're hurting me."
Lisa,This has been a Gracie Films pray-sentation!
Lisa,"Here's the book... ""Classics for Children?"""
Lisa,Why don't you read to us now?
Lisa,No Dad. It's an epic tale from ancient Greece.
Lisa,"What are you laughing at, Dad?"
Lisa,"No, Mom. Joan of Arc."
Lisa,...and please bless Mama and Papa and Bartrand and Coco Chanel...
Lisa,But I'm just a little girl.
Lisa,Victory.
Lisa,God spoke to me -- I must obey.
Lisa,"That's just you, Bart."
Lisa,"Yes, sir."
Lisa,Wait! I have been sent to lead the French army to victory.
Lisa,"With modern ideas -- like putting bigger, harder people in the catapults. Or how 'bout rocks?"
Lisa,And now... attack!
Lisa,I would gladly kneel -- were you the real king!
Lisa,"You are the true Dauphin. You had this impostor try to fool me, to see if I was truly sent by God."
Lisa,"Uh, God says we should just be friends."
Lisa,Let us kill the English! Their concept of individual rights could undermine the power of our beloved tyrants!
Lisa,You can't stop me! I was sent by God!
Lisa,I want my Mommy!
Lisa,I would like to call my only witness: almighty God.
Lisa,"Is that true, Lord?"
Lisa,"Don't worry, beloved parents. God won't let anything happen to me."
Lisa,Huh. Getting kind of hot around here.
Lisa,"What happened, Dad? They didn't really burn her, did they?"
Lisa,"Look, this story is more interesting than you think. It starts with Hamlet's father getting murdered."
Lisa,"Oh great, now Hamlet's acting crazy. Well, nobody out-crazies Ophelia! Hey, nonny, nonny, with a hoo and a haw and a nonny, nonny, hey..."
Lisa,And that's the greatest thing ever written.
Lisa,"I need to call Janey, but I can't get a dial tone."
Lisa,Why must you fight with every utility?
Lisa,What call to Brazil?
Lisa,Uh-oh.
Lisa,Please don't be mad. I've been sponsoring an orphan boy in Brazil.
Lisa,"Ronaldo used to send me a letter every month, but then they stopped. That's why I called the orphanage, but they said he'd disappeared."
Lisa,"Well, then they started pressuring me for more donations. And you can't hang up on a nun."
Lisa,"When I sent my first donation, the charity mailed me this video."
Lisa,Awww.
Lisa,A hundred and fifty-six million.
Lisa,"Not if we buy our tickets on the internet. It's really cheap if we change planes in Phoenix, Honolulu, Sun City, and East St. Louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now."
Lisa,Except Antarctica.
Lisa,"Okay, here's some travel tips: only drink bottled water... don't get into an unlicensed taxi... and remember, they have winter during our summer."
Lisa,That's right.
Lisa,Mm-hmm.
Lisa,"No Dad, it's just the weather."
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,"Look, it's the giant statue of Christ on Corcovado."
Lisa,Hey! Hey!
Lisa,How to Loot Brazil?
Lisa,Guys!
Lisa,"While you're singing and dancing, somewhere out there Ronaldo is waiting to be found."
Lisa,"Mom, these are slums. The government just painted them bright colors so the tourists wouldn't be offended."
Lisa,Here we are!
Lisa,123 Papaya Street -- this is Ronaldo's orphanage.
Lisa,"Excuse me, we're looking for this little boy."
Lisa,We're never gonna find him.
Lisa,You know I'm a vegetarian.
Lisa,"Okay, on this map I marked all the places that Ronaldo liked to go. If we split up, we should be able to search them all."
Lisa,I bet Maggie would like one.
Lisa,American corporations should stop playing God with nature.
Lisa,"Mom, my potato is eating a carrot!"
Lisa,"Whatcha doing, Mom?"
Lisa,It smells like the art teacher's office.
Lisa,"Dad, it's one a.m. And I'm out of saliva."
Lisa,"I want my old Dad back. The one who was yelling all the time and... you know, I'm not really sure what I want."
Lisa,"Dad, you just said that three minutes ago."
Lisa,"It's time for your surprise, Dad."
Lisa,As if.
Lisa,Who's Mark Spitz?
Lisa,"That's true, Bart. Our father knows the best way to embarrass his kids."
Lisa,"But seriously, we've had a lot of fun with our dad over the years."
Lisa,A lot of people think our Dad's behavior has screwed us up. And it has!
Lisa,Wait! What about Maggie's memories? Surely the innocent soul of a child will redeem mankind.
Lisa,"It worked, Mom! Maggie's memories have shown them humanity's inner goodness."
Lisa,"As head of the Student Activities Committee, I have an idea."
Lisa,The speakers are poor because we're letting just anybody do it.
Lisa,"Groundskeeper Willie, Groundskeeper Willie's enemy Seamus..."
Lisa,"Well, I think we should try the Springfield Speaker's Bureau."
Lisa,Ooh! Here's a wonderful speaker! Geoff Jenkins!
Lisa,"He created a cartoon called ""Danger Dog."" It's popular with kids and adults."
Lisa,"Bart, this is just Dad!"
Lisa,"No, it's just Dad."
Lisa,Can she have a pony? And the last line in the scene?
Lisa,What up?
Lisa,"Well, it delivers what it promises."
Lisa,How's your company gonna make money? Do you have a business model?
Lisa,Two million.
Lisa,"Dad, I'm no fan of Bart's cartoon, but you have a real problem with anger."
Lisa,"Congratulations, Dad. The first step is admitting it."
Lisa,No. The last step is quitting.
Lisa,Whaaa?!
Lisa,"Come on, guys. We're gonna be late."
Lisa,"Bart, stick to the script. Don't be a jerk."
Lisa,You're the jerk.
Lisa,Mine tastes like dog fur.
Lisa,Bravo!
Lisa,I liked all the roles filled by minority actors.
Lisa,My bad.
Lisa,Who wants to put on a leotard and get screamed at?
Lisa,Forget it. I'm going home.
Lisa,President Kennedy!
Lisa,"Well, I can't argue with the man who wrote ""Profiles in Courage."""
Lisa,Thanks. I'll see you in heaven.
Lisa,I'm more than okay!...
Lisa,Ich bin ein... gymnast!
Lisa,"Oh, thank you!"
Lisa,You think I'll pass gym this term?
Lisa,"You're reading ""Gravity's Rainbow?"""
Lisa,You guys are so cool. I can't believe I never met you before.
Lisa,"Oh, I'd love to!"
Lisa,Campus?
Lisa,You guys are college students!
Lisa,"Um... Of course. Where do you think I go, baby school?"
Lisa,Um... I'm a teacher's aide in a very special class.
Lisa,"Go, go, go!"
Lisa,Life sucks.
Lisa,"Actually, I'm off campus. I, um, share a house with a couple of girls, a couple of guys."
Lisa,"Well, Bart's kinda-- No!"
Lisa,Mm. Mom's not gonna like that.
Lisa,"Uh, that's what we call the gay guy who lives with us."
Lisa,Robert Pinsky?! The former Poet Laureate?
Lisa,Non-dairy?
Lisa,I'll see you tomorrow!
Lisa,This place is amazing! Kiosks! Outdoor study groups!
Lisa,In heaven!
Lisa,Gotta finish. Gotta finish. Am I using too much glue?
Lisa,"Lisa Simpson, master of the double life."
Lisa,Where is everybody?
Lisa,"I just wanted to belong! For once, I felt I was with intellectual equals."
Lisa,I guess we won't be biking through Italy.
Lisa,Sixteen.
Lisa,Doogie Howser went to college when he was my age.
Lisa,But the atmosphere there was so stimulating. It was a bustling marketplace of ideas.
Lisa,Well...
Lisa,What are you guys doing?
Lisa,Can I come with you?
Lisa,Two million.
Lisa,I live in a house.
Lisa,What are you doing?
Lisa,Poor Bart...
Lisa,"I know just how you feel -- isolated, alone, cut off from everyone--"
Lisa,That's not a sunset. That's a bird on fire!
Lisa,"Oh, I wish I had someplace to call my own. No one wants me around any more."
Lisa,Really? That's wonderful. But how?
Lisa,Well I can't do it tomorrow. There's an assembly in his honor.
Lisa,Ew! Bart!
Lisa,What was that?
Lisa,That caterpillar is screaming.
Lisa,"""Screamapillar Care Tips."" Wow, look at all this stuff. ""Without constant reassurance, it will die. It's sexually attracted to fire..."""
Lisa,Top suspects?
Lisa,But I like my old name.
Lisa,"Mom, Dad, thank God you're okay."
Lisa,"Dad, no. We're trying to conserve energy."
Lisa,"Dad, it's a blackout."
Lisa,Thus ends the Rule of Law.
Lisa,"Mom, Dad, someone stole my Malibu Stacy collection!"
Lisa,Are you gonna call the police?
Lisa,"Dad, that's Bart."
Lisa,Maybe we should look for clues.
Lisa,"Well, you'll be happy to know Malibu Stacey's fine. I really appreciate what you did, Dad."
Lisa,Wow. Look at Dad. People really respect him.
Lisa,"Oh yeah, that's the pride."
Lisa,"Dad, make him stop!"
Lisa,We could come with you.
Lisa,"Well, duh."
Lisa,Hm. Does Dad seem a little... dumber than usual?
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,"Goldie, you were more than just a goldfish -- you were a member of the family."
Lisa,"Dad, is there something you'd like to tell us about this horde?"
Lisa,That's it! I know exactly what we should do.
Lisa,"""William H. Bonney."" ""Gunned Down July 14, 1881. Aged twenty-one."" So young."
Lisa,"""I dream of a world without guns."" Don't we all, William."
Lisa,"He's not my dead boyfriend, he is a dead boy who happens to be my friend. Mr. Bonney, I am going to make your dream come true!"
Lisa,"If not for guns, poor William Bonney might have become a doctor, or a Senator..."
Lisa,"Sure. The point is, let's stop the madness and ban guns now!"
Lisa,"...Twenty eight, twenty nine... There's one missing."
Lisa,Three cheers for a gun-free Springfield. Hip hip...
Lisa,Hip hip...
Lisa,Hip hip...
Lisa,If only poor William Bonney were here to see his dream come true.
Lisa,William Bonney?!
Lisa,BREAK INTO THE BANK AND SNATCH THAT DOUGH...
Lisa,PLEASE DON'T HURT OUR FAMILY.
Lisa,"...poor William Bonney might have become a doctor, or a Senator..."
Lisa,"Dad, what are you doing?"
Lisa,I guess guns really are the answer.
Lisa,But man's inquisitive nature is what separates us from the animals.
Lisa,"""Dear Dad, Took money for the school book fair."""
Lisa,"Do you remember how you got home last night, Dad?"
Lisa,There's no light rail in Springfield.
Lisa,"Hey, I read about this show in Teen Modern Maturity. They film passengers with hidden cameras and catch them at their most uninhibited."
Lisa,I had no idea Disco Stu was so complex.
Lisa,Another proud moment for the Simpsons.
Lisa,That is so sweet.
Lisa,"Have you always resented us, Dad?"
Lisa,Please don't say any more!
Lisa,...while you're spending the week at...
Lisa,"And you take me places you hate, like museums, plays, and the Olive Garden."
Lisa,Come... on... Dad...
Lisa,"Dad, you knew this day was coming."
Lisa,"Look, there's Dad!"
Lisa,"No, sorry."
Lisa,"Are you sure you don't miss hanging out with your rock star friends, Dad?"
Lisa,Networks love reality shows because they don't have to pay writers or actors.
Lisa,"Bart, I have to study for the Elementary School Achievement Test. And so do you."
Lisa,It's Wednesday night!
Lisa,"Bart, the test is in two hours. And you haven't slept in a fortnight."
Lisa,"You should know, it's on the test!"
Lisa,What? I've gotta be in the same class as him?
Lisa,"Okay, the sun rises in the east, so the rooster would probably want to lay it on the cool side..."
Lisa,"Bart, I'm doing my geography homework."
Lisa,"Stop, I want to learn on my own!"
Lisa,Get out!
Lisa,"What's this weird mark next to my ""A""?"
Lisa,M-m-minus?!
Lisa,You did better than me?!
Lisa,That's cheating! Bart cheated!
Lisa,I'll take Ashley!
Lisa,Ow! You are such an immature-- punch buggy white!
Lisa,He started it! He did Punch Buggy first!
Lisa,Big fish! Big fish!
Lisa,"Well, Bart's being his usual jerky self... but Mom, I'm really excited about this new flag design. Oh, and the hotel gives you a free USA Today outside your room... No, I'm sure it's free... Okay, I won't touch it."
Lisa,"Believe me, he doesn't. His act is getting old fast."
Lisa,"He thinks he's really cool, but frankly the other kids are starting to wake up and smell the cooties."
Lisa,One last sunbeam... and we're done.
Lisa,To Fraternal Love.
Lisa,I spearheaded this one.
Lisa,"Bart, I am so mad at you!"
Lisa,The bus!
Lisa,Wait! Wait!
Lisa,"They left without you too, you idiot."
Lisa,Because you've already done it once.
Lisa,"Oh, forget it. Hey, how do we get back?"
Lisa,"Oh Bart, I think we're lost."
Lisa,You die now!
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,What do you care?
Lisa,Thanks. Where'd you get?...
Lisa,Oh.
Lisa,"Bart, you're my big brother. You should act like it more often. You know, protect me from the bad things in the world."
Lisa,"Thanks, Bart."
Lisa,I'm sorry I got us lost out here.
Lisa,I don't think I've done anything else.
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,"Listen, we're really sorry. We got lost on a field trip from Springfield Elementary!"
Lisa,I'm sorry. They don't publish that any more.
Lisa,"Dad, I'm telling you, Truman wins."
Lisa,"I win, Dad. That means I get to choose today's father-daughter activity!"
Lisa,We're building homes for the homeless.
Lisa,"Yes, but now that it's hip, all the ex-presidents are doing it."
Lisa,"There's Clinton, Bush Senior, and the nice guy who finished last, Jimmy himself."
Lisa,"Dad, what is that?"
Lisa,"Dad, you're getting paint on your wedding ring."
Lisa,This is a Band-Aid wrapped in tin foil.
Lisa,"Bart, this is all your fault."
Lisa,Whatever Bart is saying is a lie. Mom! What happened? Your endowment's bigger than Harvard's.
Lisa,"Actually, I saw them earlier and I was working on it in the hall."
Lisa,"Mom, doesn't it bother you that they're giving you all this attention just because of those?"
Lisa,Stop objectifying my mom!
Lisa,"Dad, look!"
Lisa,Be careful a-- Uh-oh.
Lisa,"Mom, do something!"
Lisa,"Well, you saved Krusty's reputation."
Lisa,That's how I felt all along.
Lisa,"Actually, it says here we're gonna see hockey."
Lisa,"This is a joke. You'll find me down with the real fans, standing ankle-deep in beer and blood."
Lisa,It's a hockey game!
Lisa,Hey Kozlov! Aim for the five hole! He's got an opening the size of Red Square.
Lisa,But the game's not even over!
Lisa,Yeah! Go Ice-o-topes!
Lisa,I think we might have termites.
Lisa,But where will we live?
Lisa,Why don't we stay at a youth hostel?
Lisa,"Dad, we have to find a place soon. I really have to go to the bathroom and I'm out of tokens."
Lisa,What's so good about it?
Lisa,Bread tastes like clothes.
Lisa,"With all this hard work, I'm too tired to worry about the world. And soon I will marry one of father's wealthy business associates!"
Lisa,"Why is the guy from ""Laverne and Shirley"" living in our house?"
Lisa,I guess the network made our show more exciting by dumping the house in a river.
Lisa,When you put your T-shirt on backwards?
Lisa,What about books?
Lisa,No.
Lisa,It still beats Disney's California Adventure.
Lisa,Sideshow Bob!
Lisa,Bob!
Lisa,Dad's heading straight for the Museum of Swordfish!
Lisa,Dad! I figured it out! The murderer is...
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,Precisely.
Lisa,I can't believe you went to the movies with the teacher. What happened to the Bart Simpson who put the mothballs in the beef stew?
Lisa,And you only wanted those as bait to catch gummy fish.
Lisa,"Hey Bart, you could nominate Mrs. Krabappel for an actual award, The Teacher of the Year. Then she'll feel appreciated."
Lisa,Universal Studios?
Lisa,"Ooh, the FutureSphere. It's what people in nineteen sixty-five imagined what life would be like in nineteen eighty-seven."
Lisa,What happened to you two?
Lisa,"Mom, is that Principal Skinner sleeping in the bed of tomorrow?"
Lisa,"So many categories... Gym teacher of the year, Substitute teacher of the year, Most Wheelchair-Accessible School Award?"
Lisa,Edna! Edna! Edna! Edna!
Lisa,I love happy endings.
Lisa,"Hey, I could really use one of those."
Lisa,"Mom, Dad, my birthday's coming up, and GirlTech Turbo Diaries are in stores now."
Lisa,Just buy me the friggin' toy.
Lisa,"A laser pointer! Thanks, Bart."
Lisa,I wonder what this could be?
Lisa,Could it be some kind of book?
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,Well... this could be fun. Let's watch it.
Lisa,"I don't like McNuggets, I'm a vegetarian!"
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,"Dad! That information is all wrong! Maggie's a baby, not my best friend! You don't know anything about me!"
Lisa,I don't think so.
Lisa,"Dad, you've had eight years to get to know me. It's too late."
Lisa,"Is that Miles Davis' ""Birth of The Cool?"""
Lisa,So you know one thing about me. Big deal.
Lisa,"Well, maybe."
Lisa,Because this lab is cruelly testing consumer products on animals. Take a look for yourself.
Lisa,They're making monkeys smoke cigarettes...
Lisa,And look at the way they've slathered those pigs with cosmetics!
Lisa,"Dad, today was so great. The animal rights protest, a visit to the Museum of Sadness and Oppression..."
Lisa,How'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? Did Mom help you?
Lisa,What report?
Lisa,"You read the ""loves his daughter"" by yourself?"
Lisa,"I was framed! You believe me, don't you Dad?"
Lisa,"Blackening our hair was a great idea, Dad. I look just like a Powerpuff Girl."
Lisa,Lady Penelope Ariel-Ponyweather.
Lisa,"Dad, we are there."
Lisa,"Aw... Life on the lam is really hard, but at least it's with you, Dad. I feel terrible for putting you through this, after what a wonderful father you've been."
Lisa,What? Why?
Lisa,Why did you do that?
Lisa,How could you?
Lisa,Let's just get some sleep.
Lisa,I don't wanna eat from the trash.
Lisa,They must have come from over there.
Lisa,Those are the test animals! The detective must have sold them to the circus.
Lisa,"Dad, are you in here?"
Lisa,"Oh Dad, you do remember something about me. Perhaps you also remember this laser Bart gave me earlier!"
Lisa,"Don't try to pin this on me, sister."
Lisa,"Mom, you didn't get the milk."
Lisa,"Don't worry, Mom. This first time we'll only take a few steps outside."
Lisa,"Dad, it's just a bug."
Lisa,I'm a magazine rack.
Lisa,"Uh, guys? Mom just left the basement!"
Lisa,The air hockey table makes passing the carrots a breeze.
Lisa,"Stop it, please! I'm trying to eat."
Lisa,And all those feet going by the window are really creeping me out.
Lisa,"'Bye, Mom!"
Lisa,Bye Mom!
Lisa,I'm tired of her criticizing my saggy glutes.
Lisa,"Dad, it's so enlightened of you to take us to a WNBA game."
Lisa,"That's Fung Pang-Li, the seven-foot sensation from Szechwan!"
Lisa,Look! That's Lisa Leslie! She showed little girls everywhere that they can grow up to be six foot five!
Lisa,"Dad, this ticket is for tomorrow's WNFL game!"
Lisa,"Dad, are you hurt?"
Lisa,"Dad, I think this might be the work of Satan."
Lisa,And there are so many places to cloister myself!
Lisa,"There are perfectly logical explanations for everything that happened. The bonfire sent soot into the air which created rain. And with all the trees cut down, a flood was inevitable."
Lisa,I'unno. Buddha?
Lisa,"Thank you, Mr. Cronkite."
Lisa,"Ladies and Gentlemen. Tonight, I'd like to harangue you about the plight of--"
Lisa,"Mom, why did you wake me up? I dreamt I was at the Kennedy Center Honors."
Lisa,"Hmm, this is an interesting old book."
Lisa,"Molochai desiratum maledictu... nosferatu ascendum corporalis...,molochai desiratum maledictu nosferatu ascendum corporalis,6

87172,302,15,Lisa Simpson: Ooh"
Lisa,"Hey, what's this?"
Lisa,BART SAD.
Lisa,"If I ever needed proof of the existence of God, here it is."
Lisa,"This isn't ""BART SAD."" It's ""BART'S AD."""
Lisa,You're Baby Stink-Breath! You're Baby Stink-Breath! En Francais! Vous Etes L'enfant Stink-Breath!
Lisa,"Good point, Dad. What would Jesus do?"
Lisa,"No Dad, it means Bart would be a legal adult and free to move out of the house."
Lisa,"Bart, where are you gonna live?"
Lisa,Do you even know what a loft is?
Lisa,"Oh, I'm gonna miss you."
Lisa,Ow! Indian burn!
Lisa,"Aw, that's so sweet."
Lisa,"Oh, tomorrow's the day the judge said we can visit Bart."
Lisa,"Wow, this place is great. That couch looks really pricey."
Lisa,"Skewed Tour? The traveling festival of rock 'n' roll, skateboarding and extreme sports?"
Lisa,"It's three hundred, Mom."
Lisa,Shhh.
Lisa,Woo hoo!
Lisa,"I guess I won't be popular this year, either."
Lisa,I-M-P...
Lisa,...U-G-N. Impugn.
Lisa,Wow. I'd better make the most of this.
Lisa,Free Tibet!
Lisa,"This is just a kickball with ""Mars"" written on it."
Lisa,It was so exciting -- I actually got applause for being smart!
Lisa,"Well, I'm not done yet. Principal Skinner said if I win the state finals, I can go to the Spell-lympics!"
Lisa,Could you use it in a sentence?
Lisa,A-M-E-L-I-O-R-A-T-E. Ameliorate.
Lisa,"Really? It won't be the same without you, Dad."
Lisa,"Except when pronounced like ""a,"" as in ""neighbor"" and ""weigh."""
Lisa,Well how often is that gonna come up?
Lisa,Yeah. I've got some work to do.
Lisa,S-C-A-B-I-E-S.
Lisa,AC/DC!
Lisa,R-E-L-A-P-S-E.
Lisa,Thank you! I've never felt more accepted. Perhaps one day people who spell correctly will replace athletes at the top of our national pantheon.
Lisa,"Uh, I was just K-I-D-D-I-N-G."
Lisa,I'm a little tired.
Lisa,Very well. L-I-T-T-L-E -M-I-S-S...
Lisa,"Well, I'm just happy you guys all came up here to Calgary with me."
Lisa,"Dad, this is my moment in the sun. How can you miss it to be with a sandwich?"
Lisa,"I guess I'll have to. Then I'll be queen of the world! Of spelling. That's right, queen of the world! Of spelling."
Lisa,"Some of us still enjoy scripted comedy, sir."
Lisa,"Well, I haven't won yet--"
Lisa,What?!
Lisa,"Who, Alex? The boy that everybody loves?"
Lisa,I'm not throwing a spelling bee! I'll die before I misspell.
Lisa,Free college?
Lisa,Throw the bee and go to college. Throw the bee and go to college...
Lisa,"No, I don't want to pay for college by throwing a spelling bee."
Lisa,"Mom, I'm having a crisis of conscience. Can you and Dad afford to send me to college?"
Lisa,But you don't play the piano.
Lisa,"Well, I suppose I could just skip college and marry Milhouse..."
Lisa,Could I please hear it in a sentence?
Lisa,"Intransigence. ""I..."""
Lisa,"Dad, you do care!"
Lisa,"With you here I can't fail. Attention, everyone. I was asked to take a dive. But I won't do it. I-N-T-R-A-N-S-I-G-A-N-C-E."
Lisa,"Oh my God, you're right. I spelled it wrong. I tried my best -- and I failed!"
Lisa,"My one chance for everyone to like me, and I blew it."
Lisa,Wha?
Lisa,You mean you're all still proud of me?
Lisa,"You have made me feel so wonderful. Thank you, Springfield!"
Lisa,That's amazing. Thank you.
Lisa,"Come on, come on, let's get to the beach!"
Lisa,"Well, I'm all set. I'm gonna be following the latest designs from Modern Sandcastle magazine."
Lisa,What a sight! It happens every year like the swallows returning to Capistrano.
Lisa,Now she's dating Mr. Flanders. That's so romantic!
Lisa,"Miss Sloane, how are you handling the change from La-la land to blah-blah land?"
Lisa,They must have moved the flight paths over our house.
Lisa,Eww! I got Bart's veal!
Lisa,"Dad, why don't you go to the airport authority and complain?"
Lisa,This is not a Delta hub!
Lisa,"There's the 10:50 from Newark... The 10:52 from Phoenix, connecting from Dallas... The 10:55 from Portland is running late. Again. There it is."
Lisa,Why don't we go to our Congressman?
Lisa,I've been saying it for three weeks! But every time I open my mouth...
Lisa,"Yeah, and entertainers are always winning elections. Jesse the Body Ventura, Sonny Bono, Gopher from Love Boat, Mary Bono..."
Lisa,"Krusty, I don't usually give advice to Republicans, but it would be nice to be on the winning side for once. You have to start making an honest connection with the voters. Talk about how you could help regular families -- like ours."
Lisa,No! Connect!
Lisa,Congressman.
Lisa,You said you were gonna get rid of the airplanes over our house. And now they're worse than ever.
Lisa,"Dad, this is a kid's menu where you help Yogi Bear get to the Washington Monument."
Lisa,That's jelly.
Lisa,We've gotta do something to help him.
Lisa,"Oh, that's easy. First it's introduced, then it goes to committee, then..."
Lisa,"Okay, paperclip, do your stuff."
Lisa,Now we just need a distraction.
Lisa,What about you and Mom?
Lisa,Who's naïve?
Lisa,Me too. The walls are paper-thin.
Lisa,Hi.
Lisa,"Dad, please. You're the head of a major corporation."
Lisa,"Dad, have you looked at this earnings report?"
Lisa,"I got a gold star at school today, for my exposé on toxins in gold-star adhesive."
Lisa,"Dad, this just isn't working."
Lisa,And what's that?
Lisa,"Hey, you can't blame Principal Skinner for wanting to feature his best student."
Lisa,"Well, I am young, gifted and yellow. My interests include music, science, justice, animals, shapes, feelings..."
Lisa,"Hey, that's not gonna happen!"
Lisa,"Dad, my life lacks direction!"
Lisa,I gotta pick a career! Gotta pick a career!
Lisa,I can find a good career at this museum. Or at lease see if they fixed that mislabeled raccoon I complained about.
Lisa,"Hmm, maybe I could be an expert on dinosaurs."
Lisa,Maybe geology...
Lisa,"Formed by unimaginable heat and pressure deep inside the earth, minerals explode in a vast panoply of... Eh."
Lisa,"That's it! Lisa Simpson, astronomer!"
Lisa,"Oh Dad, look at this one!"
Lisa,"Dad, that's a moth."
Lisa,"Dad, that's a kaleidoscope."
Lisa,What happened?
Lisa,"Thanks a lot, surviving Beach Boys."
Lisa,"Okay, Jupiter should be somewhere around here..."
Lisa,Hey.
Lisa,We've got to do something. I know --maybe we can get people to sign a petition.
Lisa,I'm collecting signatures to bring back the night sky.
Lisa,Does it make you feel superior to tear down people's dreams?
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,"Hi, I'm trying to reduce light pollution."
Lisa,"Look up at the stars, Springfield! For eons, people have gazed at the skies and seen into their souls."
Lisa,"Oh, stop."
Lisa,"The best part is, next week we'll get to see the Deadly Meteor Shower."
Lisa,"Named after its discoverer, Professor Artemis Deadly, who was ironically killed in the shower of 1853."
Lisa,"Mr. Mayor, you can't flip-flop on this! We'll miss the meteor shower."
Lisa,Nooo!
Lisa,"Forget it Bart -- it's so bright out, you can't see anything in the sky except the Fox satellite."
Lisa,"Bart, I just realized -- we both want the same thing: darkness. And we can get it if we work together, with my brain and your... your... assistance."
Lisa,"You can't have lights without power, and all the power comes from here."
Lisa,"In his sleep deprived state, he's very suggestible. Okay Dad, you are now playing patty-cake with Maggie."
Lisa,"Now we merely push this switch to ""Overload."" Yet once we do, we'll be breaking the law. Can good truly come from civil disobedience? Gandhi thought so..."
Lisa,"It worked -- I got my sky back! Dad, look!"
Lisa,Look!
Lisa,"Thanks, Mom."
Lisa,I wonder what Mom came up with for this week's 'Family Wednesday.'
Lisa,"Oh, a jigsaw puzzle..."
Lisa,Concert in Golden Gate Park.
Lisa,Ages eight to eighty.
Lisa,Does anyone have any swan heads? I've got nothing but necks.
Lisa,He's working on a jigsaw puzzle.
Lisa,"He's right, Dad. We're missing that singer's head!"
Lisa,This awful. It's like listening to Schubert's unfinished symphony!
Lisa,"Dad, where are you going?"
Lisa,It's so weird not having Dad here. I can't fall asleep if I haven't read him his bedtime story.
Lisa,Hello... hold on.
Lisa,"""Nancy Drew let out a low whistle. 'This isn't an old windmill at all. It's a new windmill!'"" No Dad, I'm sure she won't be killed."
Lisa,Dad took us antiquing!
Lisa,"Mom, I know Dad cares about you, but his feelings are really hurt. Why don't you just say you're sorry?"
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,"Thanks, Julio. I love you as a blonde."
Lisa,"SILVER BELLS, SILVER BELLS..."
Lisa,...IT'S CHRISTMAS TIME IN THE CITY...
Lisa,...WALKING IN A WINTER WONDERLAND.
Lisa,"HAVA-NICE CHRISTMAS, HAVA-NICE CHRISTMAS, HAVA-NICE CHRISTMAS...NON-CHRISTIAN FRIEND..."
Lisa,JUST HEAR THOSE SLEIGH BELLS JINGLING / RING-TING-TINGLING TOO...
Lisa,Or we could go to Walter Gropius's Bauhaus Village?
Lisa,"""On this battleground in 1881, fifty-six Indians lost their lives and four brave Americans lost their hats."""
Lisa,This whole ranch is appalling. It's built on a legacy of cruelty to animals and oppression of indigenous people.
Lisa,You're not listening!
Lisa,I'm sick of this horse slapping and cow taunting! I'm going to my room!
Lisa,I'm Lisa Simpson and you're the first person I've met here who cares about our animal equals.
Lisa,I'm sure she'd be happier without someone sitting on her back all day.
Lisa,"Mom, why are you talking like that?"
Lisa,Oh Luke.
Lisa,"Thanks for making me feel better about this place, Luke."
Lisa,"Oh, it looks like a happy sheep."
Lisa,"Well, I like it here, too. Luke has shown me the gentle side of the old west. He's really sophisticated for a thirteen-year-old."
Lisa,"But when he's twenty-three, I'll be eighteen."
Lisa,Wanna play a little longer? It's only ten and the moon is awful big.
Lisa,"Look, Cookie! There's a dance tonight!"
Lisa,Clara?! He's got a girlfriend! I feel like such an idiot.
Lisa,"I can't believe Luke has another gal. ""My name is Clara... I've known Luke for more than five days..."""
Lisa,"Yeah, it sure is..."
Lisa,...But a quicker way to the ranch is that shortcut.
Lisa,"I look forward to it. Ha ha ha ha, I hate you."
Lisa,"I'm sure she's just running late. Or, she's not coming because she doesn't understand how special you are."
Lisa,Sister?! You mean she's not your girlfriend?
Lisa,Need-help-now-come-with-me-done-something-terrible!
Lisa,... So I sent Luke's sister down the wrong trail and... Hey! Where'd all this water come from? There used to be a trail here! And there used to be a beaver dam there.
Lisa,How can we get across?!
Lisa,Run across!
Lisa,I'm sorry. I only sent you the wrong way because I thought you were Luke's girlfriend.
Lisa,Did Clara... tell you anything else?
Lisa,"Listen, Luke. It's my fault Clara got lost. I didn't know she was your sister, and I wanted you all to myself."
Lisa,"Oh, I had my first crush, and all it did was make me do terrible things and then break my heart."
Lisa,"Janey, more tea?"
Lisa,Today Balthazar will tell us about global warming in the land beyond the rainbow.
Lisa,Each year we lose seven species of gumdrops...
Lisa,That's not Mom!
Lisa,Oh! Someone Is spying on us!
Lisa,"I'm impressed that you drew up blueprints, but these are for a go-kart track."
Lisa,"Actually, Frank Lloyd Wright endured a lot of harsh criticism."
Lisa,You said his name two seconds ago.
Lisa,"Here's a role model for you, boy: Rin Tin Tin. He was brave on and off the screen. He was the first openly gay dog in Hollywood."
Lisa,"See, now that's the kind of dog you should be."
Lisa,"According to this contract, we have to change his name to ""Suds McDuff."""
Lisa,"It also says we will receive royalties in perpetuity, a bottomless keg of beer and unlimited use of the Duff corporate jet."
Lisa,Why does a dog have human girlfriends?
Lisa,"Yeah, don't listen to him Mr. Duff the Seventh. We took this dog in and loved him, and that makes him ours."
Lisa,Well I'm afraid the law is clear and Dad did renounce all claim to ownership.
Lisa,I'm not a coward.
Lisa,"Look, to get our dog back, we need a plan."
Lisa,"Mom, we need him for our plan."
Lisa,Look! There's Duffman!
Lisa,"But he won't, because he's too cowardly."
Lisa,"I know who'll save him, the bravest dog in the world -- Suds McDuff!"
Lisa,"Now's your chance, Duffman! You can save my Dad and look like a hero!"
Lisa,It's good to have you back with the Simpsons.
Lisa,"Uh-oh, Dad. I think he peed on the rug."
Lisa,"Dad, you ate the last can of tuna."
Lisa,Where do you keep the fish 'til it's done?
Lisa,"Dad, mom's been driving everyone everywhere. Why don't you take public transportation?"
Lisa,"Good for you, Dad. Could you get me some syrup?"
Lisa,Yay! I wanna amble!
Lisa,Amble!
Lisa,Amble!
Lisa,"You know what Mom really loves? Julienne potatoes. And for dessert, peach crumble."
Lisa,"Dad, maybe you could lead Bart's tribe."
Lisa,"Ideally no, but..."
Lisa,I don't think Dad is accurately portraying Native American life.
Lisa,I see you Braves received our smoke signal.
Lisa,I'm so proud of what you guys are doing. I even tipped off the local paper.
Lisa,Who'd want candy filled with laxatives?
Lisa,Does anyone else want to know why that sign is so funny?
Lisa,"C'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the Sumatran Century Flower."
Lisa,"Because I know every time you say ""pick a number from one to ten,"" it's always seven."
Lisa,The Venus Flytrap is a carnivorous plant which uses bait to lure unsuspecting prey into its digestive tract...
Lisa,The flower's starting to open!
Lisa,"Dad, the traffic's moving."
Lisa,"Way to go, Mom. Homemade dim sum, with eight kinds of dipping sauce!"
Lisa,This party's boring. Everything here is for babies.
Lisa,"Well, it looks like Maggie crawled through these bushes, spit up over here, and crashed her tricycle into the wall."
Lisa,And yet I'm still not satisfied.
Lisa,"Mom, it's ""wind."""
Lisa,"Dad, do you realize what you've done? You've created a world without Death."
Lisa,I guess so.
Lisa,A world without death...
Lisa,"Dad, you've become the new Grim Reaper!"
Lisa,"""My dad's job."" My dad's job takes him to all parts of the community. He performs a valuable service, but is often misunderstood, like a vulture or the flesh-eating maggot."
Lisa,I'll tell Professor Frink he's won. Tack för att ni förärat vår stad.
Lisa,Just for that?
Lisa,Is there a problem with your father?
Lisa,Well where is he now? Maybe I can help you two patch up your differences.
Lisa,Did a shark do that?
Lisa,"Sir, your son has brought you into the twenty-first century. It's a lot like the twentieth, except everybody's afraid and the stock market is much lower."
Lisa,It almost sounded like he plans to tear organs out of living people!
Lisa,There you are.
Lisa,Have you stopped to think about who you're hurting with this rampage?
Lisa,"No -- your son! On the biggest day of his life, when he accepts the Nobel Prize, you're not gonna be there."
Lisa,But it's not too late. You can still fly to Stockholm.
Lisa,He's right! It all checks out!
Lisa,It must be tough to win the Nobel Prize and lose your father on the same day.
Lisa,What the...?!
Lisa,"Oh come on, don't you get it? Bart stopped time with his magic stopwatch."
Lisa,Why can't I tinker with the fabric of existence?
Lisa,What happens if I press this button?
Lisa,"Sorry, sorry, sorry!"
Lisa,Don't go inside -- it's a trap!
Lisa,"Dad, the word's ""desert."" And those farmers are suffering!"
Lisa,"Oh, definitely. If you ask me, she's far less dangerous than Bart."
Lisa,I object!
Lisa,Ow!
Lisa,Doesn't this armoire belong to Mr. Flanders?
Lisa,"Dad, I'm just as sad as you are. What happened to Grandma is an outrage."
Lisa,She was acquitted. Then they put her back in jail on a technicality.
Lisa,"Well, they're transferring Grandma to a federal prison tomorrow. I say we hit 'em where they live... with a candlelight vigil!"
Lisa,"Grandma, you'll always be an inspiration to me."
Lisa,"Hey, as long as we're thinking about her, Grandma's still alive."
Lisa,"And the winner is, seventeen!"
Lisa,What?
Lisa,Hey... student body president...
Lisa,I could join past presidents. Like Otto... or Krusty!
Lisa,"Nelson, you're running for President?"
Lisa,I'm doomed.
Lisa,I can't beat Nelson.
Lisa,I can't believe Nelson is more popular than me.
Lisa,"No, I'm gonna stick to my platform of incremental policy amelioration: fluoridated water fountains, vegan lunch options..."
Lisa,"... and we deserve a French teacher who actually speaks French. J'accuse, Monsieur Kupferberg!"
Lisa,I rest my case.
Lisa,"I'M NOT THAT COOL, I DON'T WEAR JEANS / I'VE POLISHED AN APPLE OR TWO / BUT EVERY GRADE THAT I GRUBBED, I GRUBBED IT FOR YOU... / SO CALL ME BOOKWORM / BUT I'LL NEVER SQUIRM, WHEN THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE / YES I'LL TAKE MY LUNCH AT MY DESK / WHILE YOU'RE ALL OUTSIDE HAVING FUN..."
Lisa,"DON'T VOTE FOR ME, KIDS OF SPRINGFIELD / UNLESS YOU WANT AN EFFECTIVE LEADER / I'LL TALK TO TEACHERS / I'LL HANDLE SKINNER / A VOTE FOR LISA / MAKES YOU THE WINNER..."
Lisa,You wanted to see me?
Lisa,What would you change?
Lisa,I MAY BE THE NEW GIRL / BUT YOU CAN'T BRAINWASH ME / JUST OSH-KOSH-B'GOSH ME / AND THEN LEAVE ME BE /
Lisa,TO FIGHT FOR KID-POWER / I MUST BE HEARD NOT SEEN / I HAVE TO LEAD WISELY / NOT JUST PRIMP AND PREEN!
Lisa,THIS CUTE-ING-UP SUITS ME / THERE'S BEAUTY WITHIN ME / SO LET'S OLSEN-TWIN ME / GIVE THEM SOMEONE TO LOVE
Lisa,THIS GROWN-UP MAKEOVER / HAS MADE ME A SUPER-TWEEN / FOR THEY ARE MY PEOPLE / AND I AM THEIR QUEEN!
Lisa,"Well, it's a little over the top, but there's no reason I can't look good and take back the playground from the gypsies."
Lisa,"Make it snappy, Milhouse. I've got an important meeting in the teachers' lounge."
Lisa,"Oh, don't be silly."
Lisa,"Well, I have some ideas for ways we can improve the classroom experience."
Lisa,We need to get teachers more involved! Have them meet with struggling kids in the morning before school.
Lisa,"Or, we could hand out teachers' home phone numbers -- ­so kids can call them whenever they have questions."
Lisa,"Look, in the Swedish public schools, the students grade the teachers on their performance--"
Lisa,"""Photo op helping Kindergartners take off snow boots..."" ""Move the brushfire hazard needle..."" Um, shouldn't I stay here and work on school policy?"
Lisa,"Well, I am proud of my light."
Lisa,"You mean I can come to the school after hours, weekends, even during the summer?"
Lisa,Excuse me? I was wondering if I should read what I just signed.
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,Key release boilerplate? I find that very hard to believe.
Lisa,"Boy, this key opens everything."
Lisa,"And then, as school president, I don't have to take the hearing test."
Lisa,"Well, I think I can say with all humility, I am gonna be the best school president ever."
Lisa,They've taken everything!
Lisa,I would have gone with you.
Lisa,"Well, I don't feel like it now."
Lisa,WHAT HAVE I DONE?
Lisa,SKINNER BETRAYED ME!
Lisa,They made me pretty and popular just so they could exploit me and ruin my good name.
Lisa,You tricked me into betraying my fellow students!
Lisa,"I see. Principal Skinner, may I make an announcement to the school?"
Lisa,"I hereby resign as your president. And for my last act, I call a general student strike, effective immediately!"
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, I will not call off this strike until you bring back music and art."
Lisa,Meh.
Lisa,"Mom, I was elected to make this a better school."
Lisa,They've taken away our crepe paper.
Lisa,"Chief Wiggum, we're just like you policemen. Don't you ever feel like the mayor doesn't care about you?"
Lisa,"If we stand together, we are strong!"
Lisa,But... but I...
Lisa,DON'T CRY FOR ME KIDS OF SPRINGFIELD / YOU CAN STILL REACH ME THROUGH E-MAIL / AT SMART GIRL SIX THREE / UNDERSCORE BACK SLASH / AT YAHOO DOT COM / AT YAHOO DOT COM...
Lisa,"Oh, this place is paradise."
Lisa,But this is my dream.
Lisa,"Okay, let me take figure skating."
Lisa,"Well, what can I be?"
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,"No, it doesn't."
Lisa,"Bart, why don't you spend the money on something for Mom? She does so much for us."
Lisa,"Bart, that exhibit over there is biased, insensitive and anti-feminist."
Lisa,"Bart, your museum took in over three thousand dollars!"
Lisa,"Bart, I don't care what Mom said. I think you should use this money to take her on a nice vacation."
Lisa,How come?
Lisa,"Grampa, that's so romantic! We gotta go to England!"
Lisa,Prime Minister Tony Blair!?
Lisa,Maybe you could give us a personal tour of your country.
Lisa,"Look, it's J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books. You've turned a generation of kids onto reading."
Lisa,Can you tell me what happens at the end of the series?
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,Sir Ian McKellen! You're my favorite Shakespearean actor!
Lisa,"Mom, you said Macbeth!"
Lisa,"Dad, no! You turned into a roundabout!"
Lisa,"Dad, you rear-ended the Queen of England!"
Lisa,Why did you let him be his own barrister?
Lisa,We found a secret tunnel out of the tower. It was used by Sir Walter Raleigh!
Lisa,Push the gray brick in the back of the fireplace.
Lisa,Put out the fire first.
Lisa,"Oh, my God! We've made a terrible mistake. This tunnel comes out in the worst possible place."
Lisa,"Yes, Bart. An elephant's butt."
Lisa,I picked Mom a bouquet of Erigeron
Lisa,elatiors.
Lisa,Daisies.
Lisa,Flowers.
Lisa,This is even worse than you think -- look!
Lisa,Grampa! You have a job?
Lisa,"Wow, look at all this stuff."
Lisa,"Aunts Patty and Selma, can you help us pick out a Mother's Day gift?"
Lisa,Endorsed by the American Carny Association.
Lisa,What is that?!
Lisa,"I don't care if they think you're a coward, Dad. You did the right thing, hiding and crying."
Lisa,"You can strangle Bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation."
Lisa,"Dad, you can't get revenge on an animal. That's the whole point of Moby Dick."
Lisa,And Bart's missing too!
Lisa,Zoot suit... astronaut outfit... Southern belle... Renaissance dandy... Country-western octopus...
Lisa,It's gone!
Lisa,"I just wanted to see what it was like. Howdy, y'all. If you don't like mah song, I'll spray ya with ink!"
Lisa,He made it! He's finally protected from man.
Lisa,"I don't know, but whoever's in there is taking their sweet old time."
Lisa,"Hey! Wait a minute, if we're all out here, who's in there?"
Lisa,I tried the coat hanger again. I don't understand why we only try ideas once.
Lisa,Aww.
Lisa,"Wait, Santa's Little Helper had puppies before."
Lisa,And then we got him neutered.
Lisa,He's at the peak of cuteness.
Lisa,"Krusty, what's wrong?"
Lisa,"Bart, the Bar Mitzvah is the most important event in a Jewish boy's life. It's when he reads from the Torah and becomes a man."
Lisa,"Krusty, your dad's a rabbi -- how could you not have had a Bar Mitzvah?"
Lisa,"Krusty, you can still have your Bar Mitzvah as an adult."
Lisa,There's nothing in the Talmud that forbids it.
Lisa,I have a Jewish imaginary friend. Her name is Rachel Cohen and she just got into Brandeis.
Lisa,"Dad, you have to say something. Something meaningful!"
Lisa,"Well, Dad, what do you want to talk about tonight?"
Lisa,"It's great, Dad. You have tremendous power. And now it's time to put it to use."
Lisa,"No, Dad. I mean you should use your time on the air to say things that really mean something. Change the world for the better!"
Lisa,This is offensive to Christians and prunes.
Lisa,"I think that's ""drop."""
Lisa,"Cool, a toy store!"
Lisa,"Dad, I don't like the looks of this neighborhood."
Lisa,"No, Dad. This time you were just plain selfish."
Lisa,Dad? Are you okay?
Lisa,"It's Saturday, December sixth."
Lisa,"Dad, what you saw was ""A Christmas Carol."" It was written by Charles Dickens a hundred and sixty years ago."
Lisa,"Dad, you don't have to out-do Mr. Flanders. Just remember the spirit of the season."
Lisa,"Actually, most people now feel Christmas has gotten too materialistic. In fact, as a Buddhist, I believe people would be a lot happier without presents."
Lisa,People would be a lot happier without presents.
Lisa,Not any more.
Lisa,"Obviously, yes."
Lisa,Bart! On't-day ell-tay om-may uffi-ray as-hay e-say e-days.
Lisa,"E'll-shay uy-bay em-thay, upid-stay."
Lisa,Ap-cray.
Lisa,Her eyes aren't focused.
Lisa,"Ms. Naegle, even though I disagree with your principles, I certainly admire your success."
Lisa,"Bart, we're gonna lose. We have to do something."
Lisa,"Okay, but how?"
Lisa,Oh my God! I just had my most brilliant idea ever!
Lisa,You don't even know what the idea is.
Lisa,"Bart, why are we fighting?"
Lisa,There's the enemy. Give 'em all you got.
Lisa,"For all their disposable income, for all their leisure time, they had no immunity against God's lowliest creatures: children."
Lisa,Snowball!
Lisa,"Mom, I'm not sure I'm ready for a new cat."
Lisa,That book doesn't know how I feel.
Lisa,"All right, I'll look."
Lisa,"Too fluffy, too Siamese, too needy, too stuck-up, infected eye, clearly a skunk. Me-ow!"
Lisa,"Welcome to the family, Snowball III!"
Lisa,"Well, I think it's only fair I get to name him. You got to name me."
Lisa,"Coltrane, would you like to hear some music written by your namesake?"
Lisa,Coltrane?
Lisa,"Coltrane, you were with us only briefly, but we'll always have the ride home from the shelter. And uh... I guess that's it. Amen."
Lisa,"Mom, I'm not sure God responds to threats and intimidation."
Lisa,"Dad, what are all those cuts?"
Lisa,I guess I'm not meant to own a cat. I'm much happier petting this leaf.
Lisa,"Wait, you don't want me to have this cat!"
Lisa,"Look, you don't want to get involved with a girl like me. My cats have a nasty habit of waking up dead. Now go, cough me out of your life like a bad fur ball."
Lisa,You're not hurt! You're a good-luck kitty!
Lisa,"I'm keeping you! You're Snowball Five, but to save money on a new dish, we'll just call you Snowball Two and pretend this whole thing never happened."
Lisa,"I guess you're right, Principal Tamzarian."
Lisa,"Mom, can we go into this bookstore? Please, please, please, please, please, please, please?"
Lisa,I'm gonna go up to the fourth floor where the books are.
Lisa,Don't you need training for that?
Lisa,Not if I pump your heart full of morphine first!
Lisa,Why don't you just admit you don't know where the hospital is?
Lisa,We're not paramedics!
Lisa,Hm...
Lisa,"I'm proud of you, Mom. But just one thing: isn't your book a little hard on Dad?"
Lisa,"""Captain Mordecai stared at the shop window full of powdered blowholes. 'Mmm, blowholes,' he drooled."" Sounds like Dad to me."
Lisa,Maybe you should let Dad read your book before you submit it to publishers.
Lisa,"If Dad ever reads that book, he's gonna be so humiliated."
Lisa,What if they make it into a movie?
Lisa,What if they parody it on Mad TV?
Lisa,"Dad's gonna catch Flanders, just like the end of Mom's book."
Lisa,Didn't you read Mom's book?
Lisa,"Fine, I'll tell you how it ends. The brutish Captain Mordecai has cornered his rival, Cyrus..."
Lisa,I have to research a paper. Where did all the books go?
Lisa,"""Everybody Poops, the Video?"" ""Yu-gi-oh Price Guides?"" There are hardly any books at all!"
Lisa,I can't.
Lisa,Why can't your heir be female? Or-or why can't we elect our leaders?
Lisa,Leaving!
Lisa,"Mom, I can't find anything on Sacagawea. Just a couple books on Ron Santo."
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,"Oh, I can't stand it."
Lisa,"Mom, that sounds a lot like the movie ""Amadeus,"" which was historically inaccurate. Mozart worked hard on his music... Salieri was a respected composer..."
Lisa,"Well, at least they're not fighting."
Lisa,"Oh Bart, I'm sure it's hard to lose your best friend."
Lisa,Who is it? Is it Ralph?
Lisa,Fine. You can confirm the accuracy of the hose.
Lisa,"Ha, ha, ha, you wet your pants."
Lisa,"Bart, you're in my family."
Lisa,We can't jump this ditch.
Lisa,"That's not true, Bart. Mom and Dad value us equally, and... oh, you're right. 'Kay, go ahead."
Lisa,But I know so much about it.
Lisa,Geronimo!
Lisa,"Look, we can go inside!"
Lisa,"Ooh, we're like Howard Carter discovering the Temple of Tutankhamen."
Lisa,"Pictographs! Bart, this is a Native American burial mound."
Lisa,"Hey, we shouldn't tell anyone we were here. This place should be our special secret!"
Lisa,"Bart, there's spiders in your hair."
Lisa,"""The Mound Builders worshiped turtles, as well as badgers, snakes, and other animals."""
Lisa,"Hi, Janey... Branford Marsalis' car broke down outside your house? And he's just jamming 'til Wynton shows up? Oh..."
Lisa,"Um... some other time, maybe. Today I'm just hanging out at home."
Lisa,You did not.
Lisa,Who?
Lisa,Bart! I cracked the code of the pictograph. It says there's a curse on the mound. Of course I don't believe in...
Lisa,Milhouse? I thought your mom took you away forever.
Lisa,You told him our secret?!
Lisa,Oh. I see how it is.
Lisa,"Well, it's nice you have your best friend back."
Lisa,Mmm-hmm... I think I'll go to bed now.
Lisa,Nothing.
Lisa,"Look, just because Milhouse is gone doesn't mean you have to pretend to be my friend."
Lisa,Bart will make your bed for a week.
Lisa,What? Really?
Lisa,But it's not my turn.
Lisa,Bart will defend you when other kids call you a nerd. No one calls me a nerd.
Lisa,Bart will give back the Malibu Stacy head you thought was lost.
Lisa,"Oh Bart, that's really sweet."
Lisa,I think I'm gonna use this card right now.
Lisa,What's going on?
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,"It used to be the ""Leaning Tower of Pizza."""
Lisa,They just painted the tower brown.
Lisa,"Maggie, you're as smart as any one of those kids. C'mon."
Lisa,"Okay, for Malibu Stacy's beach party we've got pita, humus, tempeh, tofu... what other fun foods do we need?"
Lisa,Ice?
Lisa,Did you do that?
Lisa,"Okay, what's a good side dish?"
Lisa,Rice? Why not caviar?
Lisa,"Oh my God, you're not just smart... you're brilliant! Mom!"
Lisa,Just because Maggie can't talk doesn't mean she's dumb -- Einstein didn't speak 'til he was three.
Lisa,"Go on, Maggie, you can do it."
Lisa,"But, but my IQ is only 159! Maggie's more intelligent than me?"
Lisa,"Yes, thank you."
Lisa,Really?
Lisa,"No Mom, it's just that I used to be ""the smart one"" -- now I don't know who I am."
Lisa,I already have one of those.
Lisa,"All right, if I'm second rate as the smart kid, I'll find a new raison d'être."
Lisa,"Right, right."
Lisa,Time to show them the new me. No one's happier and more well-adjusted than a standup comedian.
Lisa,How 'bout these entrées? Stuffed cabbage? Can you believe they found a way to make cabbage worse?
Lisa,"All right, so what else is goin' on? Let's see... Hey! Why do they call them field trips? We never go to a field!"
Lisa,"Uh, well I..."
Lisa,"Okay, okay, don't get discouraged. Every me they reject gets me closer to the me they'll like."
Lisa,"It's called Goth, eternally clueless one. My new name is Ravencrow Never-smiles."
Lisa,"Okay. But first, you must apprentice by kissing the goddess Ironica, uh... who lives in this rock."
Lisa,"Do it for an hour, hour and a half."
Lisa,"Oh, none of these feel right. Oh wait, did I try ""soccer player?"""
Lisa,I'm a mess. I can't believe I'm jealous of a baby.
Lisa,You're making fun of him for something you made him do.
Lisa,People who accuse others of being gay are often covering up their own latent homosexuality.
Lisa,"Fine, I'll help you with your stupid flash cards."
Lisa,Aren't you smart. Let's try another one... A little harder this time.
Lisa,No. That's wrong.
Lisa,"That's right! This spells ""dog."""
Lisa,I used to be the smart one.
Lisa,"Maggie, you're such a quick learner -- why don't you learn how to fly!"
Lisa,"Goodbye, Maggie. I'm smart enough to know you're better off without me."
Lisa,Two cents...
Lisa,"Well, I'm sure a lot of great people have started with less."
Lisa,"Oh, I'm tired, I'm hungry, red plastic sandals are not great running-away shoes..."
Lisa,Air conditioning... water fountains... dioramas... and I'll never run into my family here! It's the perfect place to start a new life.
Lisa,Lousy Maggie... thinks she's so great... thinks she knows...
Lisa,I miss them all so much.
Lisa,"C'mon, c'mon..."
Lisa,"Mom, Dad! I'm so sorry I got you into this!"
Lisa,"Maggie, I'm sorry I was jealous of your special gift. From now on I'm gonna nurture and cherish--"
Lisa,"Maggie, push the red button!"
Lisa,You can do it. Red!
Lisa,I'm sorry I ran off. Being second to Maggie's not so bad. But why didn't Maggie press the right button 'til I told her to?
Lisa,"Go on, Maggie, you can do it."
Lisa,I don't remember doing that. I would never cheat!
Lisa,So Maggie's not a genius?
Lisa,"I don't care what they say, Maggie. To me you're brilliant."
Lisa,Not for babies.
Lisa,It's a movie version of a cartoon family you can see for free on TV.
Lisa,Because Mr. Flanders volunteered to take the senior citizens out for ice cream.
Lisa,"Mr. Leonard, how'd you get in a movie?"
Lisa,"Dad, I don't like this movie. Can we go home?"
Lisa,"It was only a movie, filmed in Vancouver, with Donald Sutherland as the priest who stopped believing..."
Lisa,Both of us heard mysterious noises coming from this very spot.
Lisa,Bart and I will explore the attic until we find their source.
Lisa,"Must be the pipes. What do you think, Bart?"
Lisa,Okay. I'll just stay calm and approach this scientifically.
Lisa,"Oh God, oh God. Oh nooo. If I don't make it out alive, I love you, Mom and Dad. Maggie, you can have my books. And Bart, I'll see you in Hell, you booger-eating wuss. That's right, we all know!"

Lisa,"He tried once, but he got confused and thought the book was real. He's still looking for that chocolate factory. It consumes him."
Lisa,"Look Maggie, it's a pop up! ""Daddy's made a shiv. Can you help him ice Johnny Shakes, the jailhouse stoolie?"""
Lisa,"Oh Dad, I missed you so much."
Lisa,"I have to admit, I'll miss having him around."
Lisa,Where's your costume?
Lisa,"Don't worry, they're just getting the plot out of the way so it won't slow down the ."
Lisa,That character is just a tired stereotype.
Lisa,"I can't believe the ""Gathering Shadow"" was Senate redistricting!"
Lisa,I'll write the letter.

Lisa,"Dad, that's our address."
Lisa,"No, he lives at the ""Cosmic Wars Ranch"" in Northern California."
Lisa,Can we go? Can we go? Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!
Lisa,"C'mon Bart, here's our chance."
Lisa,We come from the real world.

Lisa,Wow... Mom and Dad sure are having fun.
Lisa,Uh-oh.
Lisa,Did you guys get home at two last night?
Lisa,And why is Krusty on the couch?
Lisa,"Dad, I still have a couple-a questions about this. Mom never drives drunk, and the crash was in your car. Also, the driver's seat was adjusted for your stomach..."
Lisa,But I'm eight years old!
Lisa,You're a great mom. You were always there for Bart with love and support. His acting out was probably caused by negative reinforcement.
Lisa,Why would Bart escape if he's gonna be released in two weeks?
Lisa,And thanks for showing my brother that girls can be cool.
Lisa,"Taco, please."
Lisa,"Grampa, how do you sleep at night?"
Lisa,I think Skinner might make a run for it -- he's eyeing the exits and doing calf stretches.
Lisa,He's probably in costume -- he could be any of these people!
Lisa,They're going into Multi-Purpose Room B!
Lisa,"Good for you, Mrs. K!"
Lisa,At least I was planned.
Lisa,Baaaaaart!
Lisa,Why are we even going? Last year Uncle Tyrone was bitter and depressed.
Lisa,"No it doesn't! This movie is drivel! She's wooden and unpleasant, and no matter what he does, he's still Ryan O'Neal."
Lisa,"It's called Wicca, and it's empowering!"
Lisa,"That's Kaballah, jerk!"
Lisa,That's where Mom and Dad are!
Lisa,I'm an orphan!
Lisa,"Quiet, Grampa. Hello... Mom?!?!"
Lisa,Where are you?! Are you okay?
Lisa,At the Dayton Arms hotel?
Lisa,So... how's the weather in Dayton?
Lisa,"Hey, do I hear a back rub?"
Lisa,"Something's fishy. They're not in Dayton, they're somewhere fun."
Lisa,Let's go find Mom and Dad!
Lisa,Those horn-dogs -- they ditched us again! You know what this means?
Lisa,"No. We're gonna follow them across this great land, making sure they don't have one moment of fun."
Lisa,I'm going into the Gold Medallion Club... with silver-level membership!
Lisa,Busted!
Lisa,You probably do this all the time! This whole family is built on a tissue of lies and romance!
Lisa,How 'bout the floor is made of lava?
Lisa,"Yeah, I can't sleep. Maybe we should give Mom and Dad a break. You know, go spend the day in an amusement park so we're out of their hair."
Lisa,I guess the hunt was more fun than the catch.
Lisa,I know. My new thing is to ignore you.
Lisa,When you grow up I'll be outside.
Lisa,"No! You don't understand. We came here to give you some privacy, and--"
Lisa,Let me finish my sentence!
Lisa,"Well, it looks like everything worked out just fine for everybody."
Lisa,These giant vegetables are amazing.
Lisa,"My theme is ""If Music Be The Food of Love."" The setting features tuning forks, champagne flutes and of course, chopsticks. And for dessert, Ella Fitz Jell-O."
Lisa,What's wrong with it?
Lisa,Did I do anything right?
Lisa,Thank you mysterious stranger... where did he go?
Lisa,"I'm drawing a picture of my newest hero, the Pie Man."
Lisa,"""Richie Rich Incorporates In Delaware,"" ""Easy to Believe Tales,"" ""Supergirl vs. the Glass Ceiling,"" ""The Green Listener""..."
Lisa,"No, I think the expression is ""peg."""
Lisa,Dad?
Lisa,"Dad, please. It's obvious you're Pie Man. We've been getting his mail for weeks."
Lisa,"Dad, this is the basement. Here's the iced tea I left down here this afternoon."
Lisa,You're not mild-mannered. You're often liquored-up and rude.
Lisa,"I want you to stop this, Dad. Before you get killed."
Lisa,"Well, I know one thing you could do..."
Lisa,"As Springfield's youngest Buddhist, I am deeply honored to introduce the Dalai Lama."
Lisa,"And now please welcome the Elvis of Enlightenment... the lean, serene, chanting machine: the Dalai Lama!"
Lisa,"No, Pie Man! Don't do it!"
Lisa,"Dad, I think you created a hero that even you couldn't live up to."
Lisa,"Now up, the case of Simpson v. Simpson."
Lisa,How romantic. You and Dad were drawn to each other as kids and you didn't even realize it.
Lisa,Granted.
Lisa,"Mom, why are you so mad?"
Lisa,The perfect kiss!
Lisa,"That's horrible. How could you, Dad?"
Lisa,I can't believe you stood Mom up.
Lisa,That's not what dogs do.
Lisa,"Uh, I think we'll go to bed now."
Lisa,Great!
Lisa,Make mine calico!
Lisa,This whole morning has been wonderful. Too wonderful.
Lisa,"Oh, please let it be Volvo."
Lisa,"This is ridiculous. Only babies and ex-junkies are afraid of needles. Stick me, Chuckles!"
Lisa,Can I have a lollipop?
Lisa,"Dad, he's deaf."
Lisa,We've become pariahs! In the last two hours I've gotten one thousand hate spams.
Lisa,"We get it, Mom."
Lisa,"I'm as patriotic as the next person, but changing the traffic lights to red, white and blue just seems dangerous."
Lisa,I'd like to say something about the current climate of repression and fear.
Lisa,"""Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."""
Lisa,That's from the first Amendment to the Constitution. Thank you.

Lisa,"I don't know whether it's the lack of sleep, the sodium pentathol, or that it's the only cartoon I've seen in two months. But this is what I believe in now."

Lisa,Thank you. Geezer Rock -- an appreciation in verse.
Lisa,"""Postcard image, thing to see--"""
Lisa,"Gotta go, sweetie!"
Lisa,But I didn't read my poem!
Lisa,My poem has become an elegy. An elegy no one will ever hear.
Lisa,"Publish it myself? Why not? I could put out a whole newspaper dedicated to the rock. I'd be a publisher, just like Katherine Graham!"
Lisa,"Thanks for helping me deliver the first edition of The Red Dress Press, Dad."
Lisa,"""Elegy for Geezer Rock:"" / ""Postcard image, thing to see, / To think of Springfield is to think of thee. / What thoughts be-pass a'hind thy mien? / Why sky art blue, why trees art green?

Lisa,Tomorrow's? I hadn't thought about publishing more.
Lisa,"All right, Nelson. What kind of journalism skills do you have?"
Lisa,"Perfect. You're our TV critic. Ralph, what about you?"
Lisa,"Hmm, how about feature columnist?"
Lisa,It's not fair!
Lisa,"Nice work, Bart! But give him a runny nose. I want the readers to gag on their morning cup of Joe."
Lisa,Don't call me Chief.
Lisa,Chief is fine.
Lisa,Burns owns everything! I've gotta speak out before it's too late!
Lisa,"""Dear readers: you hold in your hands the last paper not controlled by the Burns media empire. We are not afraid to say Montgomery Burns is a monopolistic, self-aggrandizing hmmm... stinky pants."""
Lisa,"I'm sorry Mr. Burns, but my paper's not for sale."
Lisa,"She's very pretty, but the answer is still no."
Lisa,"They're so beautiful. And their breath smells like peppermint! No! No! I won't take your blood ponies! Go on, sweetie. Go on. Shoo!"
Lisa,I can't. My Mom's not picking me up for an hour.
Lisa,I think it distracts people from more important social issues.
Lisa,You can't leave now! We're the only thing stopping Mr. Burns!
Lisa,Everyone chickened out. Except Ralph. He got poached by the Chicago Tribune.
Lisa,I guess we're down to just me.
Lisa,"Bart, you're staying!"
Lisa,"Oh, it's beautiful."
Lisa,What the...?
Lisa,Dad! Mr. Burns cut our power -- now I can't print my paper!
Lisa,"Stupid Burns, cuts off my power, lowers my credit rating..."
Lisa,You're not mad about Principal Skinrash?
Lisa,What's that?
Lisa,"Dad, how could you say these things?"
Lisa,"Well, at least there's nothing else Burns can do to me."
Lisa,Nooo!
Lisa,The Homer Times?
Lisa,"Oh, Dad..."
Lisa,"This is so sweet, but I've learned one little paper can't make a difference in this world."
Lisa,The Barney Bugle?
Lisa,You have a newspaper too?
Lisa,I couldn't be prouder.
Lisa,"Mr. Flanders, why are you moving?"
Lisa,"Well, you can't fight fate, but if you must shoot our father, please remember our family motto: ""Not in the face."""
Lisa,Hmmm.
Lisa,Science Officer!
Lisa,"Dad, you should listen to him. He's a man of science and you can barely read!"
Lisa,"To get Maggie in time, we'll have to catch a ride on a nerve impulse -- the body's information super-highway!"
Lisa,"Oh, my God! This is the worst Halloween horror we've ever faced."
Lisa,"Dad, would you like some of my Snicker-bar cheesecake?"
Lisa,"What do you think, Thomas Pynchon?"
Lisa,"If you win, Ovenfresh Industries will make you the new face of Auntie Ovenfresh."
Lisa,"Mom, a letter from Ovenfresh Industries!"
Lisa,Thank you for applying to the Ovenfresh Bakeoff. Every year many wonderful cooks fail to qualify.
Lisa,"""...but screw them, you're in! Congratulations!"""
Lisa,Come on Mom! You still have twenty minutes left -- you can fix it!
Lisa,Emanations!
Lisa,You feed us on twelve dollars a week?
Lisa,"Hurry, Mom!"
Lisa,I can't believe my Mom would cheat.
Lisa,"Oh, she'll win the contest, but she'll lose her soul."
Lisa,And lose her soul.
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,"Congratulations, Mom. You seem to have a prescription for success."
Lisa,Don't forget your secret ingredient...
Lisa,Cheating!
Lisa,"Mom, if I don't have you to look up to, I don't have anyone."
Lisa,"I don't want Mickey Mantle, I want my Mom."
Lisa,I guess Dad has to be my hero now.
Lisa,Hey look! The new Ovenfresh flour bag!
Lisa,"Check it out, girls. Sixty-eight squares of ankle-busting fury!"
Lisa,"That's right, a double-dogleg, hamstring-knotting Hop-Way to Hell. What insane kangaroo dreamed this fevered nightmare? Behold!"
Lisa,"Ladies, grab your pebbles!"
Lisa,What?
Lisa,Shut up! I do not!
Lisa,"Dad, the kids at school said my butt's big."
Lisa,Maybe a different outfit would make me look thinner.
Lisa,This store makes me feel even worse about myself.
Lisa,I know! It's such an unrealistic standard for young... Huh?
Lisa,"Hey, I don't look so bad."
Lisa,Noooooo!
Lisa,What?! I'm not fat enough already? How could you say that to me?
Lisa,No thanks. I'm gonna stay in the library and do a little reading.
Lisa,"Sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six..."
Lisa,I can't hear you.
Lisa,That doesn't make any sense!
Lisa,I know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy and anti-feminist... but that's what a fat girl would say!
Lisa,"Now, I can't have toothpaste tonight."
Lisa,"This is the perfect test -- if I can have one dab of frosting and then stop, I'll know I've conquered food at last."
Lisa,That was too easy.
Lisa,"Okay, if I stop here, I still have some dignity."
Lisa,"Yeah, a little. Those mean girls just get to me."
Lisa,"Thank you, Nelson."
Lisa,I really appreciate you teaching those mean girls a lesson.
Lisa,I'd like that.
Lisa,"Nothing. Like many women, I still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight."
Lisa,I guess. But there's a long way to go.
Lisa,I'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem.
Lisa,That was you.
Lisa,It's a media circus!
Lisa,A media circus.
Lisa,"ABC, CBS... uh-oh, the Christian Science Monitor has a flat tire!"
Lisa,The Juice is still on the loose.
Lisa,Technically he was born in Shelbyville.
Lisa,"You're successful too, Mom. You made a chore wheel that's both fair and wise."
Lisa,"Chloe, I really admire how you got out of Springfield and became such a success."
Lisa,Harper's Magazine! I have a picture of Lewis Lapham on my binder.
Lisa,"Chloe, you've lived so many fascinating places."
Lisa,Chloe is amazing -- even her serving bowl smells glamorous.
Lisa,Did you know back in high school that she'd be such a star?
Lisa,Miasmas!
Lisa,"Oh, that Moe. But good for you, Mom! Why didn't you follow Chloe into journalism?"
Lisa,"Oh, Mom, don't feel bad. Everybody appreciates your... uh-oh, I'm late for my dinner... with Chloe!"
Lisa,"There's ""Dan Rather"" and ""Tom Brokaw"", hanging out with Kent Brockman!"
Lisa,That was such an exciting night. Morley Safer has the biggest head I've ever seen.
Lisa,It's gonna be a let-down going to school tomorrow. We have to make a pilgrim out of felt.
Lisa,Oh! That'd be wonderful! Oh I'd -- I'd have to ask my Mom.
Lisa,Hmmm. So... is it okay if I go to the women's conference with Chloe?
Lisa,"I've never disobeyed Mom before. Is this a step I'm really willing to take? I don't know. The more I think about it, the..."
Lisa,Bart! Thanks for helping me make up my mind.
Lisa,I didn't cushion your...
Lisa,"Hello, U. N. Women's Conference!"
Lisa,Wha--?!
Lisa,We're trapped!
Lisa,I'm not a journalist.
Lisa,"I'm sure you did. But still, don't you ever wonder what might have happened if things had gone differently?"
Lisa,Help... Help... So much sulfur dioxide!
Lisa,"Be careful, Mom! There's hot lava under the ground!"

Lisa,"If you're feeling depressed, do what I do and write something. A novel, a play..."
Lisa,Why don't you go legit and sell your shirts in stores?
Lisa,I bet you could find a distributor at the Springfield Novelty Expo.
Lisa,Great! Will you play Malibu Stacy with me?
Lisa,Done and done. I'm going to the organic market!
Lisa,Wheeee!
Lisa,It's my entry for the all-school science fair.
Lisa,"It shows the history of nuclear physics, from Marie Curie's laboratory to a scale model of the first nuclear reactor."
Lisa,A robot?! Last year the winner was a jar of owl pellets. I don't have a chance now.
Lisa,"Well, we're supposed to do this without parental help."
Lisa,Dad?...
Lisa,"Dad, what did you do?"
Lisa,Yes...
Lisa,"Dad, that could explode!"
Lisa,Mom! Dad built a device that would be deadly in the wrong hands! And he's holding it!
Lisa,It doesn't seem fair to the regular visitors.
Lisa,Mr. Burns acting nice? That's odd. He must be up to something.
Lisa,How many men do you know?
Lisa,"""The Plywood Pelican was larger than a football field. It weighs more than the state of New Hampshire. It was only flown once, by its creator, Mr. C. Montgomery Burns."""
Lisa,"This must be the ""nasty surprise"" he mentioned in the invitation."
Lisa,That show's gone off the air.
Lisa,Drugs aren't so expensive in other countries.
Lisa,What countries are those?
Lisa,No.
Lisa,A-lo-ha!
Lisa,"We just wanted to thank you. Because of the Xanax, I'm not over-anxious about being a Simpson anymore. I am a little anxious about being on Xanax, but the Zoloft covers that nicely."

Lisa,You ate fruit! You ate fruit!
Lisa,"DARTS AND MEATPIES, AND LAGER IN PINT GLASSES"
Lisa,WHAT A CLASSY WAY TO GET DRUNK OFF YOUR ASSES
Lisa,And they seem awfully chummy.
Lisa,I'm not inferring anything. You infer. I imply.
Lisa,"Well, if Hollywood movies have taught us anything, it's that troubled relationships can be completely patched up by a mad dash to the airport."
Lisa,Are you sure Mom and Dad want us to enter a European balloon race?
Lisa,"I used to love Springfield Park, but it's gotten so run down."
Lisa,Looks like all you're teaching is obnoxiousness and poor sportsmanship.
Lisa,"He's just being true to the Bible, which is pretty violent."
Lisa,Wait a second - I've read that you speak excellent English.
Lisa,"Dig in, everybody!"
Lisa,Really? Didn't you just sign a ninety million dollar contract?
Lisa,Hmm... the TV changes channels every time the dog barks.
Lisa,I think he swallowed the remote.
Lisa,Just what we need. Another lame suburban kid who loves rap.
Lisa,"Rappers stopped saying ""illin'"" twelve years ago."
Lisa,"They stopped saying ""keepin' it real"" three years ago."
Lisa,A shirt from that rap concert... Bart must've gone to the show. But that means...
Lisa,Dad!? Why did you do that?
Lisa,Why did you burn up your shirt?
Lisa,"So you see Principal Skinner, that's why I had to come to you."
Lisa,"It doesn't matter. The point is, only with your help can I expose Bart's lies."
Lisa,"Mr. Alcatraaaz, my name is Lisa Simpson, and this is Principal Skinner."
Lisa,This proves Bart lied about being kidnapped!
Lisa,Wait just a minute.
Lisa,"The way I was raised, by Mom, I learned the truth can't be swept under the rug."
Lisa,"Dad, I don't understand. After all the corruption and deceit we've witnessed, how can everyone just party?"
Lisa,I hope this bad publicity doesn't affect tourism.
Lisa,I have a real suggestion.
Lisa,"Why don't we legalize same-sex marriage? We can attract a growing segment of the marriage market, and strike a blow for civil rights."
Lisa,"Well, what about people of the opposite sex who want to get married?"
Lisa,I mean a man and a woman.
Lisa,Why are we dressed as Sunday Best Simpsons for dinner with Aunt Patty?
Lisa,I thought you said Aunt Patty was just waiting for the right man.
Lisa,"Aunt Patty, where did you two meet? Alternative book store? Ethiopian restaurant?"
Lisa,"Well, that's the end of Dad's wedding business."
Lisa,Sure am!
Lisa,You make those same stupid jokes every field trip!
Lisa,What happened to the glacier? It's nearly melted. This must be due to global warming!
Lisa,No it isn't -- it's a lump of slush! Look at it!
Lisa,"Ah, pre-modern man. If these wise warriors could speak, what would they tell us?"
Lisa,"Listen, people!"
Lisa,"How can you stand there eating snacks and being children, when the world's glaciers are vanishing?"
Lisa,We have to do something about it!
Lisa,Glaciers are nature's alarm clock...and it's time for us to wake up. Can there be any doubt that the culprit is greenhouse gas produced by man?
Lisa,"People, please! I'm talking about toxic vapors."
Lisa,Baaart!
Lisa,Help! I'm sinking in the lake!
Lisa,Whatever!
Lisa,"Bart, you are the meanest, nastiest little boy that ever lived."
Lisa,You don't even care how upset I am! But this time you have gone too far.
Lisa,"You'll see. Oh, you will see."
Lisa,Yes. The clerk also gave me this bench warrant for Dad's arrest.
Lisa,"Hey, this really works."
Lisa,"I like eating here with you, Dad. Especially without ""Don't have a cow, man."""
Lisa,"Oops, need more soda."
Lisa,"Mom, I don't mean to be mean. But every time I think about forgiving him, I remember all the bad things he's done to me."
Lisa,Name three.
Lisa,"Yes, but he thought that was a bad thing."
Lisa,He did try to cheer me up when my hamster died.
Lisa,"Okay, that's two... ...and that's it. If I think of another one, I'll let him back in."
Lisa,"Stupid, selfish Bart. Like he's ever gonna do another nice thing for me..."
Lisa,"He's building a me! Well, I mean, it's a little American-primitive... but who am I to dismiss outsider art? It shows he misses me... and this is the third thing!"
Lisa,"Bart, don't worry."
Lisa,I'm relinquishing the poke-pole.
Lisa,I'm not sharpening it!
Lisa,"No, I'm giving it up!"
Lisa,I've realized how much I missed you -- and I can see from this magnificent Lisa statue that you felt the same way.
Lisa,"Bart, you were gonna burn the third nice thing you've ever done for me?"
Lisa,"Aww, Bart, I missed your lies... And I was kind of a pill. I guess."
Lisa,Gimme that torch.
Lisa,"What about your pet iguana, Jub-Jub?"
Lisa,"Don't give up, Aunt Selma. China has thousands of baby girls who need adoption."
Lisa,The Great Wall of China was begun nearly two thousand years ago in order to repel barbarian invaders.
Lisa,I don't know about that -- I'm considered pretty smart.
Lisa,How dare you make light of that brutal--
Lisa,"Listen, I've got a plan to get Ling back. But we must be discreet. You never know where there might be a spy."
Lisa,"Uh, let's talk about this outside."
Lisa,"Yeah, Dad. If you don't look perfect, you'll never be able to sneak in and steal Ling back."
Lisa,"You look just like a Buddha statue. Now, all you need is an expression of utter serenity."
Lisa,"If we can just get to the Delta Airlines Gold Medallion Lounge, they can't get in without spending frequent flyer miles."
Lisa,"Well, I think -- in these days of petro-terrorists and ozone depletion -- a Sunday drive reeks of bio-hubris."
Lisa,Out of the way! I learned CPR while waiting for other kids to finish their math tests.
Lisa,Compress his chest!
Lisa,"Mom, why are you so worried about money?"
Lisa,It's so embarrassing Mom is making us wear clothes from Goodwill.
Lisa,"Neat! When I sleep at Dad's, I call this bed."
Lisa,That's a bread compartment.
Lisa,Oh boy!
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,"No, I don't see Dad doing all that paperwork."
Lisa,Oh boy. Let's get out of here before Dad does a bad impression of Mom.
Lisa,"Hey, I know this is a crazy idea, but hear me out. What if we..."
Lisa,"Wow, I was gonna say ""call Reverend Lovejoy,"" but I guess this could work."
Lisa,How do you know that's their blimp?
Lisa,"Let's see, the RV dealership is across the freeway on the corner of... hey, this is a Flintstones Fun Map."
Lisa,"Look, Dad wrote something: ""Dino -- short for dinosaur? Remember to ask Jeeves."""
Lisa,"Dad, Snowball's not fat. She's just got winter fur."
Lisa,"Yeah, kiss and make up!"
Lisa,We're going downhill... and I can't reach the brakes!
Lisa,Look!
Lisa,Runaway Truck Lane! We're saved!
Lisa,"Ah, rats."
Lisa,Oh! The famous Shelbyville Theater District! Can we see a play?
Lisa,They're saying Springfielders are stupid hicks.
Lisa,"For your information, Springfielders can be intelligent and articulate. I happen to know because we're from Springfield."
Lisa,"Okay, she's fat."
Lisa,Can't breathe... someone dangle some string!
Lisa,We're not overfeeding her. We've been giving her this low-fat cat food!
Lisa,I'll bet she's sneaking food from someplace else! Let's follow her!
Lisa,"One thing at a time, Bart."
Lisa,This is worse than when we thought Mom was having an affair. It turned out she was just going to the library to cry.
Lisa,"Hey, that's the smell of her real family! The Simpsons! And for your information, our walls have a bunch of dead raccoons in them. But we are saving up the money to find them!"
Lisa,Snowball does tricks?
Lisa,"Well, I don't care what you say, she still loves us more. Don't you, Snowball?"
Lisa,You toyed with my heart like it was a toy heart.
Lisa,What is it that they have that keeps Snowball coming back to their house?
Lisa,What is Bart still doing in there?
Lisa,"Bart, why were you in there so long?"
Lisa,"Oh yeah? Well, there's your girlfriend."
Lisa,"No, you do. You're gay for Moleman!"
Lisa,Where are we?
Lisa,How did you know we were coming?
Lisa,Don't you mean astronomy?
Lisa,Milhouse?! Uh! I've been turning him down for the prom since kindergarten.
Lisa,"Bart, maybe you should listen to this."
Lisa,You've wrecked my life! / You're gonna wreck my life!
Lisa,"Well Bart, I really appreciate what you're gonna do for me."
Lisa,My hamster!
Lisa,He was supposed to be in a show-and-tell this week. That's not gonna happen!
Lisa,"Yay, Mom!"
Lisa,"Also, gerontological studies have demonstrated that animal companions can slow the inevitable decline of--"
Lisa,I'm sure everyone's happier with Santa's Little Helper here to love them.
Lisa,Right after Pat Sajak.
Lisa,"And here's the clincher... Ray Magini is an anagram for ""imaginary."""
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,That seems... feasible.
Lisa,Oh my God! Look at these ingredients!
Lisa,"Wow, Krishna Krisps, Amazonkers, Lollapalollipops -- these sound like my kind of snacks..."
Lisa,"Ooh, Dalai Lamanade!"
Lisa,"""Hydrogenated petroleum oil, monosodium poisonate, partially de-weaponized plutonium?!"""
Lisa,"Attention, duped masses!"
Lisa,"These new vending machine snacks are crammed with processed sugar, industrial byproducts and trans-fatty acids!"
Lisa,I think he's having a heart attack!
Lisa,"Bart, how can you laugh at that? You just had a heart attack!"
Lisa,I'd better tell Dad.
Lisa,Um... maybe Mom's the way to go.
Lisa,I know how we can raise money!
Lisa,Maybe we could shop somewhere else. There's a farm stand next door.
Lisa,"Well, I think this family should try more vegetarian meals. We'd feel better and live longer."
Lisa,I brought you some weak tea and dry toast.
Lisa,"It's 'cause your bodies are so used to processed food it's a shock when you eat vegetables full of vitamins, minerals and trace amounts of bug feces."
Lisa,"Stop it! You'll all feel better if you get a little sleep. Now, close your eyes..."
Lisa,"HUSH, LITTLE BABY, DON'T SAY A WORD / MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A MOCKINGBIRD / AND IF THAT MOCKINGBIRD DON'T SING..."
Lisa,AND IF THAT DIAMOND RING TURNS BRASS / MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A LOOKING GLASS
Lisa,Looks like you guys are on the mend.
Lisa,"Thanks, Bart. That's really sweet."
Lisa,Ow!
Lisa,I hope we didn't camp out here for nothing. It's like every kid in Springfield showed up.
Lisa,"And if I win, I'll be on Itchy and Scratchy..."
Lisa,"Nicely done, Wind-dancer. But seriously, cruelty to animals is no laughing matter. You can make a difference!"
Lisa,"And remember, save the violence for cartoons!"
Lisa,I can't believe I used to date him.
Lisa,There's no way I'm gonna beat her.
Lisa,How did you write a song so quickly?
Lisa,I'VE BEEN TO PARIS / AND LONDON AND TOKYO TOWN / BUT ONE CRAZY BURG / HAS 'EM ALL BEAT HANDS DOWN...
Lisa,I'M TALKIN' SPRINGFIELD / YOU CAN BUY CHIMICHANGAS / TALKIN' SPRINGFIELD / THE CHICKS HAVE BIG GAZONGAS
Lisa,THERE'S TIRES / ON FIRE / A GUY NAMED APU
Lisa,AND SKINNER / AND GRAMPA / AND OL' DISCO STU...
Lisa,Did I forget to mention yoooouuu?
Lisa,I'M TALKIN' SPRINGFIELD... WHERE NOBODY SUCKS! Except for Flanders?
Lisa,"No, we did it, Dad."
Lisa,"I really do like working with you, Dad. Will you keep helping me?"
Lisa,LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LAAAAAAA.
Lisa,"I really appreciate your taking such an interest in me, Dad."
Lisa,Really? What's wrong?
Lisa,Is it possible to get a green spotlight?
Lisa,"No, it's fine."
Lisa,"That's Cameron. Girls go crazy over him. He's cute, unthreatening, and his smile brought a puppy back to life."
Lisa,MY KITTY DIED ON CHRISTMAS EVE
Lisa,DADDY TOLD ME TO BE BRAVE
Lisa,BUT INSTEAD OF SINGING CAROLS / I WAS DIGGING SNOWBALL'S GRAVE...
Lisa,"But Dad, you don't need to help me by humiliating people."
Lisa,I don't like sausage.
Lisa,Dad... you're fired.
Lisa,"Dad, I'm sorry you're hurt, but you left me no choice. You were obnoxious at a level not even permitted in show business."
Lisa,No one asked you to yell and slash!
Lisa,You're working with Cameron now?
Lisa,Dad looks so happy.
Lisa,"Dad, I don't want things to be awful between us. I made you some cookies."
Lisa,"Hi! This lighting's a little bright. And um, could I get a red wash in the background?"
Lisa,"Thanks, Dad."
Lisa,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have a confession to make. I didn't have my usual songwriter tonight..."
Lisa,So I took a stab at writing my own song. Something that expresses what's really in my heart.
Lisa,"Bernie, if you please."
Lisa,"I'M IN THE FINAL TWO / I SHOULD BE HAPPY / BUT ALL I WANT TO DO / IS SPEND MORE TIME WITH MY PAPPY... NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE, DAD, I MISS YOU SO MUCH / AND YOUR THREATS AGAINST TEAMSTERS AND TECHIES AND SUCH / YOUR MANAGEMENT STYLE IS LIKE ATTILA THE HUN / YOU WERE VICIOUS, MALICIOUS, BUT YOU GOT THE JOB DONE..."
Lisa,"I'M SORRY I HURT YOU, BUT PLEASE DON'T BE SAD / YOU'RE NO LONGER MY COACH, BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS MY DAD..."
Lisa,"Dad, you know the best part about this whole thing has been the time we've spent together. I don't care if I win, just as long as you're in my corner again."
Lisa,"Dad, you sabotaged Cameron for me!"
Lisa,"Well, I think you're the sweetest Dad in the whole world."
Lisa,Now you're getting creepy.
Lisa,Good.
Lisa,"Mom, Bart and I have been talking..."
Lisa,"Yeah, the templates had a great run. But we'd like our hair to look like um... people hair."
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,"Bart, you look worse than Aunt Patty in the morning. And there ain't nothin' looks worse than Aunt Patty in the morning."
Lisa,My good-girl points!
Lisa,Dad?!
Lisa,Come on -- we'll hide in the theater!
Lisa,It's the title of the movie.
Lisa,"No, ma'am."
Lisa,"Dad, we love you, but we just don't think the world is coming to an end. Yet. A hundred years, global warming... we're goners. But for now, do you think you could lighten up on this ""left below"" stuff?"
Lisa,"Dad, please don't go through with this. All through history, self-anointed seers have predicted the end of the world, and they've always been wrong."
Lisa,"Dad, if you'll recall, I never believed in you, not for one second."
Lisa,We've got school tomorrow.
Lisa,Why didn't we listen to Dad?
Lisa,"Dad, we've been so worried about you!"
Lisa,Oh boy! This is what sunny Sunday afternoons are for!
Lisa,Her films are so lyrical! The phone lines are gonna be jammed.
Lisa,"Hey, I won four free movie tickets! And it starts in half an hour!"
Lisa,"It's Albanian. But the producers added subtitles to make it ""commercial."""
Lisa,I feel so much empathy for those villagers. They had to drink their own tears...
Lisa,"Dad, I don't think you realize what you've done. You've totally humiliated the best friend the Simpsons ever had."
Lisa,That's what we've been trying to tell you!
Lisa,"Well, at least your name's on the bowl."
Lisa,The ones made from potatoes?
Lisa,Cooper! More pink lemon-ale!
Lisa,Cooper! Thy staves are not flush!
Lisa,"Guards, take him to the tower!"
Lisa,Noble idiot! Bring in the pie!
Lisa,I dedicate this pie to the backbone of the feudal system: the serfs.
Lisa,"Bart, a school-sponsored Medieval festival is supposed to be the best day of a young girl's life, and you ruined it. You deserve to be expelled."
Lisa,Catholic schools are usually the most affordable private schools.
Lisa,"That's Latin, Dad. The language of Plutarch."
Lisa,"No, Plutarch. He chronicled the lives of the Roman emperors."
Lisa,"Strange as it sounds, Dad, I agree with you."
Lisa,Everyone should be able to choose their faith -- just like I chose Buddhism.
Lisa,"I'll ignore that. In fact, I'm gonna help you. I have a pretty good idea where they are."
Lisa,Who's Professor Pigskin?
Lisa,How is that possible?
Lisa,"I get it. Every week they send out two pamphlets, half picking one team and half picking the other. Eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think Professor Pigskin is always right! That's when they ask for your money."
Lisa,"Dad, it's a scam!"
Lisa,"Look, all I'm saying is, you really should think twice before..."
Lisa,"Dad, how much money did you bet?"
Lisa,Those reindeer look really uncomfortable.
Lisa,"Mom, I got a rash where the reindeer licked me."
Lisa,All we've got is ketchup.
Lisa,No. I mean ketchup.
Lisa,"Dad, I don't think we're gonna find Mom today. And I'm sick of eating at restaurant chains I've never even heard of, like Skobo's and Dim Willie's."
Lisa,Ew.
Lisa,I see Mom!
Lisa,We've gotta tell Dad! Where is he?
Lisa,Saving!
Lisa,This stinks -- my room is the only one that faces that cemetery!
Lisa,Thanks for making me feel better.
Lisa,There's no such thing as zombies!
Lisa,Stop scaring me!
Lisa,"Bart, don't you have homework to do?"
Lisa,"I believe in science and reality, not ghosts and monsters!"
Lisa,Can I sleep with you guys tonight?
Lisa,"Well, I heard they finished the stamp museum. That could be fun."
Lisa,"Dad, you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house."
Lisa,"Wow, look at all these worthy Americans..."
Lisa,The Land of the Wild Beasts? That's the first book I read all the way through.
Lisa,Groundskeeper Willie?
Lisa,I thought those people were your friends.
Lisa,I didn't know grownups said bad things about other grownups.
Lisa,But I thought it was wrong to talk about people behind their backs.
Lisa,I know. I'm sorry.
Lisa,Is it the chair?
Lisa,Grampa?
Lisa,What about Bart's bedroom?
Lisa,Yeah.
Lisa,"Okay, I'll watch TV."
Lisa,"Mom, I think there's a danger this time they might lose the Ponderosa!"
Lisa,I can't keep sleeping in Mom and Dad's room.
Lisa,Mom showed me how to make a retaining wall out of pillows. But I'm gonna conquer my fears... tonight.
Lisa,I've changed my mind! Can you please open the gate?
Lisa,"If I can just spend the night here, I'll never be scared again. And boy, you're free to go home whenever you want."
Lisa,"Hi, Dr. Nick."
Lisa,"Bye, Dr. Nick."
Lisa,We don't go to you anymore. We have a better doctor.
Lisa,"Okay, gotta keep calm. If Scooby Doo has taught me anything, it's that the only thing to fear are crooked real estate developers."
Lisa,Where am I?
Lisa,Not scared... not scared...
Lisa,But I'm too smart to get scared.
Lisa,"You know, you monsters seem scary, but when you get a little closer you're just funny."
Lisa,But wait. How am I supposed to sleep with that spooky cemetery outside my window?
Lisa,My Dad says they're too expensive.
Lisa,I think I'll be okay by myself.
Lisa,"Bye, guys. You really helped me a lot."
Lisa,New pony?
Lisa,I think I'm gonna be fine. Let's get some breakfast.
Lisa,"Hi, Bart. I baked you some cookies."
Lisa,"If you two don't mind, I'd like to watch that cool Fox show about teenagers in Orange County."
Lisa,"I bet that bra was planted by Sterling, to break them up."
Lisa,"Dad, I thought Mom kicked you out of the house."
Lisa,"Okay look, you and Mom can fix this. What exactly happened between the two of you?"
Lisa,Where are you staying?
Lisa,"Bart, I think you're behind this whole thing."
Lisa,I can read you like a book.
Lisa,"If you don't tell Mom what you did, I will."
Lisa,Enough with the tricks!
Lisa,Stupid movie schemes do not work in real life. Mom and Dad have a marriage on the rocks and they need to work through it in therapy to make sure it doesn't shatter.
Lisa,"Bart, that would be the stupidest thing you ever did."
Lisa,"Uh, Mom? Remember how you wished we would never grow up?"
Lisa,Having a robot brother troubles me. The ethical implications are really tensing me up.
Lisa,"Goodbye, implications..."
Lisa,I hate going to the zoo. I feel so sorry for the animals.
Lisa,Dad! Dad! Wake up! You're not a robot!
Lisa,You're just possessed by the Devil.
Lisa,"Please don't accept this invitation, Dad. Hunting is cruel."
Lisa,"Mom, Mr. Burns is gonna kill Dad!"
Lisa,"Ooh, everyone's wearing such an interesting costume."
Lisa,"Look! Grampa's a gorilla, Sideshow Mel is Spiderman, and Nelson's a raccoon..."
Lisa,They're tearing down the pier!
Lisa,Bart?
Lisa,You mean this?
Lisa,I'm worried about Mom. She's been sitting there just petting the dog for two hours.
Lisa,Mid-June?
Lisa,"Dad, there's no such thing as ""Father's Day Eve."""
Lisa,"Fine, there's a Daddy Claus."
Lisa,"Sure, why not."
Lisa,I'm afraid the best thing I could find is this.
Lisa,"You know, this mass-produced junk doesn't express how I feel about Dad. I am making him a present that comes from the heart."
Lisa,"Hello. I'm looking for something in a pipe cleaner. Extra bendy, with medium fuzz."
Lisa,"The unicorns are you and me, Dad. I drew it myself."
Lisa,"What do you think? Huh? Huh? Pretty heartfelt, huh? Huh?"
Lisa,"You didn't like it, did you?"
Lisa,"Oh Dad, how could you?"
Lisa,I'm not a baby! A baby is zero to two.
Lisa,I'd rather not go than lie.
Lisa,Stupid Dad. Doesn't care about my feelings...
Lisa,"Sure, that's all you men do is, take and take and take, without regard to feelings or unicorns...here, take my lunch, too!"
Lisa,Just take my whole backpack!
Lisa,"Oh, it had to be a boy, did it? You think a girl can't flip out? Well, you're wrong!"
Lisa,Don't make me affix it to your file.
Lisa,I guess.
Lisa,Janey's father just takes her to the zoo once a month. Couldn't you be that kind of dad?
Lisa,"Oh, yeah."
Lisa,How did you do that?
Lisa,This election is out of control. Someone terrible could win!
Lisa,"Ah, Mortadella!"
Lisa,"Dad, we've got to do something."
Lisa,Lincoln was only one man.
Lisa,"Look, as the Safety Salamander, you are beloved by all. And if you were the Mayor, we could make sure that only good people, like me, tell you what to do."
Lisa,And I will be your campaign manager!
Lisa,"Well, Dad, you tried to make this town a better place. And no matter what, that makes you my hero."
Lisa,"Yeah, I warned you about that."
Lisa,You don't have a tail anymore.
Lisa,"Nelson, those don't count as Easter Eggs!"
Lisa,Summer opportunities.
Lisa,Oh my God! Spend a summer in Rome!
Lisa,Uh... check.
Lisa,Of course I do. Why would I say it if I didn't?
Lisa,Vóglio affittáre úna bárca píccola.
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,"Arrivedérci, ignorance!"
Lisa,That's my Italian tutor!
Lisa,"Oh, hey Milhouse. I think Bart's upstairs."
Lisa,"Oh sure, I get it. Bart told you I was taking lessons, so you thought you'd come over and--"
Lisa,You really speak Italian?!
Lisa,"Okay, if that means teacher."
Lisa,"Buon giórno, Milhouse."
Lisa,Thank you. I've been studying. I even made flash cards!
Lisa,My efforts!
Lisa,Present.
Lisa,One gelato for... the pretty girl.
Lisa,"But Luigi, surely you speak Italian."
Lisa,I had a wonderful time today. Grázie. Grázie míll-eh.
Lisa,MILHOUSE IS TEACHING ME / TO SPEAK SO PRETTILY / I'LL QUIP SO WITTILY / WHEN I'M IN ITALY...
Lisa,Milhouse! Just what is going on?
Lisa,"Sono cosí matto a lei! Ho pensato abbiamo avuto qualcosa andando, e poi la prendo con questa sgualdrina! Lei me fa malato!"
Lisa,Grazie. Idioto!
Lisa,Idioto! Idioto! Idioto!
Lisa,"Well, some people in Europe have the impression that America has made some stupid choices in the past, oh, five years. So for the next week, I'm from Canada."
Lisa,"Dad, don't you want to turn around and see the tower?"
Lisa,"When Mount Vesuvius erupted, people were overcome by volcanic ash so fast that they were frozen in whatever position they were in at the moment of their death."
Lisa,That's a DVD of a Fellini movie!
Lisa,Mozzarella! Parmigiano! Provolone! Pecorino! Gorgonzola! Fontina! Tallegio! Bocconcini!
Lisa,Maybe there's a mechanic in this Tuscan village.
Lisa,"Hey, she says the mayor speaks English."
Lisa,Sideshow Bob!
Lisa,How did you wind up here?
Lisa,"And literature is filled with tales of redemption, from Jean Valjean to the voice of Buzz Lightyear, Tim Allen."
Lisa,"Dad, don't act like Mussolini!"
Lisa,Bravo! Bravo! Bravissimo!
Lisa,Whoopsie. I'll just get it out with more wine.
Lisa,"See? S'fine. Go on, go on with the thing."
Lisa,"Yeah, but he's a wanted killer in our community!"
Lisa,More like jailed at Sing Sing!
Lisa,I feel so sick.
Lisa,Sideshow Bob!
Lisa,"Dad, you're driving on an ancient Roman aqueduct!"
Lisa,"Hey, Krusty's in an opera, here in Rome! He can save our lives! Come on, let's go!"
Lisa,Sideshow Bob has sworn a vendetta against us.
Lisa,"Dad, the Phantom isn't in this."
Lisa,"This is no act, they're actually trying to kill us!"
Lisa,It's Santa!
Lisa,What are you doing in the chimney?
Lisa,"Oh, Bart, why'd you ask him a follow-up question?"
Lisa,Cyrus? You never mentioned him before.
Lisa,"That's quite a tale, Grampa."
Lisa,Santa must have left it.
Lisa,"I don't know, Dad. This time of year everybody does it, 'cause you don't have to pay for the music rights."
Lisa,HE'S AT THE DOOR!
Lisa,'CAUSE CHRISTMAS EVE IS HERE!
Lisa,They must have just made this a toll road.
Lisa,"Well, what choice do you have?"
Lisa,"Boy, you sure showed them."
Lisa,"""My dearest Mona. You've just left my arms to return to your husband, Abe, and already I ache for you."""
Lisa,"Well, this whole fatherhood issue could be resolved with a simple DNA test."
Lisa,"Grampa, stop."
Lisa,"No, but he told us to say hi. Hi!"
Lisa,So... what setting is that fan on?
Lisa,I would have guessed low.
Lisa,They had to feed you through a tube.
Lisa,Our instruments are rusting!
Lisa,I already made up a yard-sale sign!
Lisa,My Malibu Stacy heads!
Lisa,"Oh no, Bart blamed this on the dog! I didn't pet him for weeks! Oh, I'm sorry I doubted you, boy."
Lisa,We've only brought in five dollars. And that came from Mr. Flanders buying back his own stuff.
Lisa,"Well Maggie, I always knew it would some day boil down to just you and me. I'll look for work in the morning."
Lisa,My saxophone!
Lisa,You're a jerk! I'm telling Mom!
Lisa,"Willie? I hope I'm not being too personal, but you seem resigned to a life of abject squalor."
Lisa,Don't you ever hope for anything better?
Lisa,And...?
Lisa,ADEQUATE... ADEQUATE...
Lisa,Bart! Willie could have a better life! If only someone showed him how...
Lisa,I bet I could turn him into a proper gentleman! And I will do it in time for the School Science Fair!
Lisa,"I think you'll find that deep down, anyone can be civilized. Goodnight, Willie."
Lisa,"Willie, in the next few weeks I'll be teaching you poise, pronunciation and posture. Let's see you stand up as straight as you can."
Lisa,Okay. How do you address an Archbishop?
Lisa,"Alright, let's just try one more lesson. Repeat after me: ""What flows from the nose does not go on the clothes."""
Lisa,"No! C'mon, Willie. I believe in you!"
Lisa,Say it again!
Lisa,I THINK HE'S GOT IT! OH YES HE'S GOT IT!
Lisa,WHERE IS THAT GHASTLY FLOW?
Lisa,AND WHERE SHOULD IT NOT GO?
Lisa,"Dad, get your own song."
Lisa,You're a smash G. K.!
Lisa,"That's where you're wrong, Principal Skinner. I did enter a project... and it's been in plain sight the entire evening!"
Lisa,"Mr. G. K. Willington is not who he seems. In fact, he's someone you all know quite well!"
Lisa,I give you... Groundskeeper Willie!
Lisa,Hm... maybe there's room on my sports wall.
Lisa,Now you have a friend.
Lisa,"Willie, there are no more lessons. You're a proper gentleman, my work is done."
Lisa,"I think this is the perfect job for the new you, Willie. It requires sophistication, tact, and you get to meet the highest class of people."
Lisa,"So, how you doin', Willie?"
Lisa,With one little difference.
Lisa,I understand.
Lisa,"Don't worry, Bart. I brought something that'll keep you interested -- a nickel in a water bottle!"
Lisa,It's so impressive.
Lisa,Oh no!
Lisa,This chamber's not on the map! We could be stuck in here forever if we don't find a way out!
Lisa,"I'll stay with you, Dad."
Lisa,"Sure. Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom--"
Lisa,"Oh. All right, um, I'll tell you something that happened to me last week. I was walking home from school..."
Lisa,...when suddenly I heard...
Lisa,"Hello, Mr. Bighorn Sheep!"
Lisa,"I've read about you. You're shy, and you rarely approach humans!"
Lisa,And of course you'd never attack a fellow herbivore!
Lisa,Mad beast!
Lisa,C'mon!
Lisa,Maybe Mr. Smithers will help us.
Lisa,You worked at Moe's?
Lisa,I understand. I'll just read a magazine.
Lisa,"Yeah -- it's like the play within a play in ""Hamlet."""
Lisa,Let's see... It's like when you watch old home movies of you watching TV.
Lisa,Treasure?!
Lisa,"So, to contin-"
Lisa,"Well, my best recollection of Burns' paraphrasing of what he read in Moe's letter is that Krabappel told Moe..."
Lisa,"My pearl necklace! I must have lost it, and you were just bringing it back to me."
Lisa,How did you find this?
Lisa,I want a photo of the hero who risked his life to save me!
Lisa,"Mr. Burns got his plant back, and I like to think I found a shred of humanity in his withered soul."
Lisa,"Aw Dad, did my story make you cry?"
Lisa,Ready!
Lisa,That was awesome!
Lisa,I wanna go to the showbiz animal retirement home.
Lisa,They take in animals from the movies and TV that aren't cute anymore.
Lisa,Uh... sure.
Lisa,This is much sadder than I expected.
Lisa,She looks like she's crying.
Lisa,"No, no, it's still ""kid-napped."" The prefix applies to the victim."
Lisa,"Dad, you can't keep this up for long."
Lisa,Maybe there's another way to solve this. Bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for Toot-Toot.
Lisa,"Hey, I know how we can save Bart."
Lisa,He also happens to be Toot-Toot's son.
Lisa,"Nelson, Funny Town doesn't exist."
Lisa,"Listen, we can trade Mr. Teeny for Bart. We just have to find a way to get him up there."
Lisa,Mother-Flippers? What's this show about?
Lisa,"Dad? Please come home, we miss you. Is that a high-def TV?!"
Lisa,"Wow, there's a rainbow outside."
Lisa,I already saw that exact same show on another network.
Lisa,This is an ABC sweatshirt.
Lisa,"I don't understand, Dad. Our family has so many flaws. Why must we share them with the world?"
Lisa,But Dad...
Lisa,Forget it.
Lisa,Fox flew me out here to bring you back. They flew me on Frito Lay's Air Force Yum!
Lisa,"And I'm required to say ""Come to the cool ranch and rope in flavor. Yee ha."""
Lisa,I know who Donald Trump is.
Lisa,"Yeah, the only thing we're known for is leading the country in heart attacks."
Lisa,It's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up.
Lisa,We're not dead... and neither are you.
Lisa,Suicide?!
Lisa,"No! Wait! Wait! Bullfighting is a cruel, pseudo-sport!"
Lisa,HOW MANY BULLS / MUST MY GRANDFATHER KILL...
Lisa,"Dad, that's Mac Tonight."
Lisa,"Grampa, I think you should give up the bullfighting."
Lisa,"But you just got a new lease on life. Why would you want to use it to hurt poor, helpless animals?"
Lisa,"I was always cheering for you, Grampa. Till now."
Lisa,Grampa must've set them free!
Lisa,"De nada, Grampa."
Lisa,"Aw Dad, we'll miss you so much."
Lisa,Hello?
Lisa,"Calm down, Dad. What happened?"
Lisa,"Mom, I'm scared."
Lisa,Oh yeah? What's Mom's birthday?
Lisa,What secrets?
Lisa,"I'm proud of you, Dad. You're the first man to ever outsource the American worker's sense of entitlement and privilege."
Lisa,What about this swordfish?
Lisa,"I know one, about the most important sea voyage in American history. The journey of the Mayflower."
Lisa,"Not prostitutes, Protestants."
Lisa,The year was sixteen twenty...
Lisa,"Mother, we must protect him. Look, he's praying."
Lisa,And I will make thee a hat from construction paper!
Lisa,"I keep telling you, the ability to add two-digit numbers is not witchcraft!"
Lisa,Seventy-four.
Lisa,We haven't gotten our food yet!
Lisa,I'm starting to think the Sea Captain isn't coming back.
Lisa,...and you've got the elderly Jewish couple making their first trip to Israel.
Lisa,We're the band. And we're on!
Lisa,I THINK WE'RE HEADING FOR DISASTER / AND MOST OF YOU WILL NOT BE SAVED...
Lisa,UNLESS THE CAPTAIN IS ATTENTIVE / WE'LL ALL BE CRUSHED BY A HUGE WAVE...
Lisa,This hatchway is jammed!
Lisa,"Okay, the engine room is just through this flooded area. Somebody has to take the rope, swim through to the other side, and tie it off so we can use it as an underwater guide line."
Lisa,I can't wait to see this re-imagining of Itchy and Scratchy... by avant-garde director Juliana Krellner!
Lisa,I love the use of streamers as blood. It robs the violence of its power.
Lisa,"Yeah, one for boys and one for girls."
Lisa,"It's so beautiful. Ooh, paintings by female artists! Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keefe..."
Lisa,Cathy Guisewite!
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,Are we gonna do any actual math problems?
Lisa,"But... isn't it? I mean, confidence building can't replace real learning!"
Lisa,"Okay, boys' school -- I need a challenge!"
Lisa,A mental challenge.
Lisa,"He forgot the volume of the carrot nose -- one-third base times height! Oh math, I have missed you!"
Lisa,Principal Skinner?
Lisa,"Assistant Groundskeeper Skinner, don't you think it's wrong that I can't get the best math education because I'm a girl?"
Lisa,"Mom, the girls' school is a joke and I'm not allowed to take the boys' math."
Lisa,That's right. I'm Toilet.
Lisa,"Well, what can I do? They won't let me in the boys' school."
Lisa,"Mom, I don't think this will fool anybody."
Lisa,What're you playing?
Lisa,I'm... Jake.
Lisa,Uh... Boy... man... Boyman. Jake Boyman.
Lisa,"Yeah, I guess I do."
Lisa,My name isn't Toilet -- it's Jake!
Lisa,What are you drawing?
Lisa,"That's easy -- just one, the number five."
Lisa,So... do you miss having the girls around?
Lisa,Did you know Lisa Simpson? I heard she was pretty cool.
Lisa,What the hell are you talking about?!
Lisa,I have to go.
Lisa,"Nelson, you're not really angry at me. You're full of rage 'cause your father abandoned you."
Lisa,"And because you're poor, so you don't feel like you're good enough."
Lisa,"You just want somebody to say ""I love you"". I love you."
Lisa,Eep.
Lisa,"Not yet. If I do, she'll never let me go to the boys' math class again."
Lisa,You'd do that for me? That is so sweet.
Lisa,"Ow, that hurt."
Lisa,I'm gonna be sick.
Lisa,What have I become?
Lisa,"Fine, I'll beat up Ralph."
Lisa,"Uh, give me your lunch money."
Lisa,Uh... uh...
Lisa,Forgive me for this.
Lisa,Sure!
Lisa,Peew! Peew!
Lisa,Thank you. Or should I say thank you!
Lisa,"That's right, everyone. The best math student in the whole school is a girl!"
Lisa,That's a lie!
Lisa,I always thought that boys had it easier. But now I see their world is more cruel and sadistic than I ever imagined.
Lisa,"And I did get better at math, but it was only by abandoning everything I believed in. I guess the real reason we don't see many women in math and science is..."
Lisa,"Well, whatever the answer is, I'm glad I'm a girl and I'm glad I'm good at math. Now enjoy your stupid flautist."
Lisa,"Dad, all you had to do was paint one number. Now no one's gonna be able to find our house."
Lisa,"Mom, what are you doing?"
Lisa,This is a total stranger who cleans houses for a living. Who cares what she thinks?
Lisa,"I'm Lisa, I'm eight years old, and this might sound presumptuous, but -- I'm your favorite."
Lisa,"Well, talk to me in a week."
Lisa,The sound of the baby must have triggered a primal mnemonic response in Mom's brain.
Lisa,This is horrible.
Lisa,"Dad, we don't want you to leave!"
Lisa,"Well, now it's time for my summer activity. You promised we could go to a museum."
Lisa,"I'm so glad you picked the Museum of Natural History, Mom."
Lisa,"Bart, it's still history."
Lisa,Creationism? But that's not science.
Lisa,How can you teach the book of Genesis as a scientific theory?
Lisa,This is slander! Darwin was one of the greatest minds of all time!
Lisa,"Evolution is widely acknowledged as scientific fact. It's even accepted by prominent conservatives, like George Will and the late Pope John Paul!"
Lisa,All I'm saying is--
Lisa,"They're making us learn creation theory in school. Today we had a test, and every answer was ""God did it."""
Lisa,But they're incompatible!
Lisa,"Mom, you really have to choose here, between science and belief."
Lisa,"Dad, you're not really reconsidering evolution, are you?"
Lisa,I have an issue I'd like to raise!
Lisa,"Last week, the unscientific theory of creationism was introduced alongside evolution in Springfield public schools."
Lisa,"Evolution and Creationism cannot co-exist, people. It is time to go back to teaching one single truth!"
Lisa,"I'm so glad you could all come. I'll be reading to you from ""The Origin of Species"" by Charles Darwin."
Lisa,Chapter One: When we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals...
Lisa,There are so many worse crimes. Why are you persecuting me?
Lisa,"I'm sorry, Mom. I should have just gone with the flow like you said."
Lisa,"Thanks, Mom."
Lisa,"Mr. Flanders, wait!"
Lisa,"I want you to know, I respect your beliefs and I can see how deeply you feel about them."
Lisa,"I just don't think religion should be taught in our schools, any more than you'd want scientists teaching at the church."
Lisa,It's amazing they've gotten five hundred and twelve shows out of this premise.
Lisa,"But, Grampa, in nineteen forty-two, they only played women's baseball here."
Lisa,"Shake it off, Buck!"
Lisa,I concur!
Lisa,"Isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice? They're always fighting -- if you listen closely, you can hear them arguing right now."
Lisa,"Otto, help me!"
Lisa,I'm not afraid of you.
Lisa,I understand. I'm not like my Dad either.
Lisa,There's a triple A battery in my macaroni and cheese!
Lisa,I can't eat this.
Lisa,"Well, you're not gonna find any here."
Lisa,It's delicious!
Lisa,"No, it's great! Except for the bee!"
Lisa,You could make a great chef someday.
Lisa,Mom!
Lisa,"Oh Michael, one bite of this soufflé and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower."
Lisa,"Fat Tony, it's not important what other people think of you. What matters is how you feel, inside!"
Lisa,Where did you get that?
Lisa,It's so great that Michael's doing what he loves.
Lisa,"Why didn't you tell him it was an accident? It was an accident, right? Michael?"
Lisa,Michael?
Lisa,You guys need a break. Why don't I take Bart with me to the children's be-bop brunch at Jazzy Goodtime's?
Lisa,"Hey Bart, you wanna jam with me?"
Lisa,"Not bad for a newbie, Bart! You just may be the second-best player up here. In case you're wondering who the best one is, it's me."
Lisa,"Yes, I am."
Lisa,Pleased to meet you.
Lisa,Yes...
Lisa,Yes?
Lisa,Yes!
Lisa,"Oh, I can't believe..."
Lisa,'Cause I've wanted to jam with jazz musicians all my life! How would Bart like it if I just hopped on his skateboard and instantly became great?
Lisa,Mild-mild-mild-mild-mild!
Lisa,It's jazz! Jazz! You don't even know the name of the thing you are stealing from me!
Lisa,I always wanted a jazz nickname!
Lisa,That is the most unfair...
Lisa,"Bart, does that even mean anything?"
Lisa,"Mom, I'm gonna lose it! Bart's on the cover of both local jazz magazines: ""Blowin'"" and ""The Sugar Sheet""."
Lisa,Here's the only thing I've been on the cover of.
Lisa,That might work.
Lisa,"Aww, they're all so cute."
Lisa,"Well, I kind of like this guy..."
Lisa,"Ooh, but this one is precious!"
Lisa,"Okay, this little guy's coming home with me! Who's gonna get neutered tomorrow? You are! Oh, yes you are."
Lisa,I did? How?
Lisa,I never wanted that to happen!
Lisa,I won't get tired of him!
Lisa,I'll take him too!
Lisa,I'll take him too.
Lisa,"Okay, guys. No one knows you're here, so be quiet. And if you get hungry, there are rats living in the Christmas decorations."
Lisa,"Shut up! I just said ""shut up."" I'll punish myself by going upstairs."
Lisa,Bart! What are you doing here?
Lisa,"No, Buttercup! No!"
Lisa,I feel so terrible. I just wanted to save those animals while Bart became a drummer... but I never thought the two stories would intersect.
Lisa,Sure.
Lisa,I guess that's it. These animals are all gonna die.
Lisa,Do you have an idea?
Lisa,"Oh, Bart, thank you so, so much!"
Lisa,This place is looking a little run down.
Lisa,Now it's a collection of candle kiosks and Persian CD stores.
Lisa,I never wanna go back to that mall. There were eels in the photo booth!
Lisa,"Wow Mom, you made all this?"
Lisa,This is a valuable skill. People might even pay you to build things for them.
Lisa,"Bart, Skinner's gonna be really mad at you."
Lisa,"Whatever, I've got some paper to mâché."
Lisa,"Dad, here's a thought: if you just gave Mom credit, maybe she could help you."
Lisa,I'd like a Daddy who lived in the real world.
Lisa,"Dad, put aside your selfish male ego and tell the truth!"
Lisa,"Dad, no! It could teach us the secret of interstellar travel!"
Lisa,"Bart, did your mystical Jewish monster beat up those bullies?"
Lisa,"Hmm, well I think your golem doesn't like hurting people. And I'll prove it."
Lisa,Speak.
Lisa,Do you feel bad about what you did?
Lisa,He sure is neurotic for a monster.
Lisa,"Just write a scroll, asking him to stop."
Lisa,What is everyone doing?
Lisa,Martians? You do know that radio broadcast was a hoax?
Lisa,"Yeah. It was an Orson Welles radio play of ""War of the Worlds."""
Lisa,Dad! A flying saucer blew up that statue!
Lisa,"Standardized tests, standardized tests, standardized tests..."
Lisa,Fur is murder! When's the Krusty movie coming out?
Lisa,"Well, you'd better hurry. I don't think Dad can last much longer where he's hiding."
Lisa,"Mom, we've got to stop them from pacifying our town!"
Lisa,"Colonel, I hope you've learned that an occupying foreign force can never defeat a determined local populace. Among the many things we learned in Vietnam is that a well-motivated..."
Lisa,"My report on a ""Fascinating Springfielder"" is due Monday, and everybody I've tried to interview is so boring."
Lisa,How many others do you have?
Lisa,"What a deep, tormented soul..."
Lisa,Moe!
Lisa,You have a worldview both bleak and beautiful! I wanna write a report about you!
Lisa,Because I suspect deep within you is an artist's soul.
Lisa,"Moe, these fragments are fascinating. ""I was in the Christmas pageant once. Mom showed up with a new boyfriend. He called me Steve."""
Lisa,What you've got here is poetry!
Lisa,"You know, artfully arranged, these fragments could be an epic poem -- like T.S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland."""
Lisa,"How 'bout this for a title: ""Howling at a Concrete Moon."""
Lisa,Philistines.
Lisa,"I don't care about my grade. I'm gonna send Moe's poem to ""American Poetry Perspectives."""
Lisa,"Moe, you're a published author!"
Lisa,Who was that?
Lisa,"The Wordloaf Festival?! You'll meet all the great American writers, Moe! You have to go!"
Lisa,I'm not here.
Lisa,It's Tom Wolfe! He uses more exclamation points than any other major American writer.
Lisa,But we were a team!
Lisa,"Mr. Szyslak -- there must be some person, possibly in this very room, who believed in you when no one else did."
Lisa,But how can you--
Lisa,But... I deserve... acknowledgement...
Lisa,You guys go ahead. I don't think I'd be very good company...
Lisa,"Moe, you're a heartless jerk!"
Lisa,Moe marginalized my contributions...
Lisa,"Oh, Moe."
Lisa,"Dad, no! I'm not mad at Moe anymore!"
Lisa,"Well Moe, I guess we're friends again."
Lisa,I'd like that. I'd like it a lot.
Lisa,"Bart, what are you doing?"
Lisa,How can we forget? Mom says now we can't afford to go to the orthodontist.
Lisa,Grampa's been watching us.
Lisa,Mom! Mom!
Lisa,Comic Book Guy! Have you seen our Mom?
Lisa,Mom! Bart's drinking coffee!
Lisa,I hope everything's okay.
Lisa,County Fair music?
Lisa,You actually convinced people not to go to Nelson's party?
Lisa,"Ah c'mon Bart, the party will be fun. Nelson's not bad -- all he needs is a little kindness."
Lisa,"All right, no husband."
Lisa,"So, how was Nelson's party?"
Lisa,Haw haw!
Lisa,"Dad, can't you read me a story for a little bit?"
Lisa,"Angelica Button and the Dragon King's Trundle Bed. It's the ninth book in the ""Angelica Button"" series."
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"Oh Dad, I'm tired. We'll read more tomorrow."
Lisa,No! We have to read it together.
Lisa,"Hey Bart, do you want some ice cream? I just hit a major marshmallow vein - Ooo, I think it goes all the way to the bottom!"
Lisa,What's wrong?
Lisa,"C'mon Dad, read the last chapter! Everyone says there's a big surprise -- I bet Angelica discovers that she's a wizard!"
Lisa,It would be the day my childhood ended.
Lisa,"Come on, read, read!"
Lisa,Why are you stopping? We're almost at the happy ending!
Lisa,Is that really how it ends? What happened to the Merlinical Council?
Lisa,"Dad, you can read to me anytime."
Lisa,Dad's ending is better.
Lisa,What I want can't be bought at any store.
Lisa,"What? No! I mean, that's a given. But also, the Malibu Stacy Pony Beach Party Set with Sparkle Sand. It's sold out everywhere."
Lisa,Really?
Lisa,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Lisa,"Oh, you poor man. Fired on Christmas Eve!"
Lisa,It's Christmas! It's Christmas! It's Christmas!
Lisa,Kinda.
Lisa,"It's your foot doctor, Gil! Yes... yes... oh dear... I can't tell him that."
Lisa,"Oh, man. Now he's even mooching our lunches."
Lisa,Back to Scottsdale.
Lisa,End of story.
Lisa,"Mom, I understand your psychological need, but I'm not sure what you can do."
Lisa,There he is!
Lisa,"Dad, there aren't any places left to sit."
Lisa,Ta-da!
Lisa,Ta-da!
Lisa,Ugh. This is the most disgusting place we've ever gone.
Lisa,After Brazil.
Lisa,Yum-yum fish?
Lisa,Maybe you just overfished them.
Lisa,Maybe you killed them all.
Lisa,Maybe you should be ashamed of yourself!
Lisa,It's not over yet!
Lisa,"Oooh, an institute!"
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,Wait! Haven't you learned a lesson here? Over-fishing and greed have brought this town nothing but rack and ruin.
Lisa,Repent! Repent! Before it's too late! I always wanted to do that in a New England church.
Lisa,This is not what I wanted at all!
Lisa,"Chill Thunder! ""Chill Thunder""!"
Lisa,"Papa, may we have petit fours?"
Lisa,Uh... deux... troi....
Lisa,"FRÈRE JACQUES, FRÈRE JACQUES / DORMEZ-VOUS, DORMEZ-VOUS..."
Lisa,Papa Meaux! Papa Meaux!
Lisa,"Dad, wait, I've got a story about why revenge is wrong."
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"I call it...""Revenge of the Geeks."""
Lisa,"Milhouse, thanks to you, the nerds can breathe easy. Except the ones with asthma. Which is all of them. But still, it's great."
Lisa,"Milhouse, what's gotten into you?"
Lisa,"No, no! You've already got your revenge!"
Lisa,"There are no small parts, just small actors."
Lisa,"Milhouse, don't you see... you're addicted to revenge."
Lisa,I see. While it would be an honor to be your queen...
Lisa,I feel it would be best if we just stayed friends.
Lisa,"The point, Dad, is that when you take revenge, you become just as bad as the person you harm."
Lisa,"But it didn't bring your parents back. Tell me, big boy, was it really worth it?"
Lisa,Tomorrow's Multicultural Day at school.
Lisa,I've got to give a presentation about our family's heritage. But ours is so boring!
Lisa,"Bart, stop that. Native Americans are a proud people with a noble heritage... A noble heritage that anyone can claim!"
Lisa,"""My great-great, great-great great grandmother was a Native American. She was a member of the..."""
Lisa,"...Hitachee Tribe.,hitachee tribe,2
111238,390,17,Lisa Simpson: Wait"
Lisa,"You're right. I'll just need to find ""traditional garb""..."
Lisa,"...and so my proud people were nearly destroyed by the warfare, disease, and greed of the invading Europeans."
Lisa,"Today the Hitachees have dwindled to a handful, and our detailed genealogical records were cruelly destroyed by the white man. So, any attempts to research my tribe would be the ultimate insult."
Lisa,Oh... great! I'd... love to.
Lisa,The Hitachees invented women's lacrosse... soft luggage...
Lisa,And that thing where you're walking and someone's walking towards you and you each try to step aside but you both go the same way and you do it again and again until one of you just scoots around? They had seven names for that.
Lisa,"Uh, thank you and goodnight."
Lisa,"Show's over, let's go!"
Lisa,"Well, some of my report... um... wasn't thoroughly fact-checked."
Lisa,"Yes, we're among the lostest."
Lisa,Centered. Centered. You know where the four states come together?
Lisa,Not there. Not even close.
Lisa,We were south... west of... North Dakota-lahoma.
Lisa,"Slow down! You're too close to that car! Your hands should be at ten and two, not three and nothing!"
Lisa,I'll be good.
Lisa,The people of my tribe lived in harmony with the land.
Lisa,"Eating mock buffalo steaks made from peaceful turnip roots, uh, they... environment... umm, dignity... corn god... I'm sorry, I can't do this!"
Lisa,I made it all up! There is no Hitachee tribe! I took the name from my microwave! But surely you can forgive a little girl who--
Lisa,"Yes, you should've!"
Lisa,"Bart, that's a blowhole!"
Lisa,"Oh Fah-ther, my pony Buttercup can jump ever so high-- Hoo-boy, it's Mr. Burns."
Lisa,"At bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. And you know what? No monsters have gotten me yet."
Lisa,What kind of lunch is this? A drawing of a sandwich?
Lisa,Excuse me.
Lisa,"Lisa Simpson, with the school paper."
Lisa,Am I to understand you're purposely denying education to these children?
Lisa,You haven't heard the last of this!
Lisa,No you haven't!
Lisa,You asked to see me?
Lisa,Me... a tutor?
Lisa,THE HILLBILLY TYKES WILL BECOME MY TUTEES!
Lisa,My name's Lisa. What are your names?
Lisa,And that's how a presidential veto gets overridden. Any questions?
Lisa,Hm... maybe the best way to begin your education is to get you some exposure to the wider world. So I'm gonna take you to downtown Springfield!
Lisa,And guess what -- Ben and Ken the Street Magic Men are only the beginning! The city is a treasure trove of culture and multi-culture!
Lisa,MISTOS AND LATTES AND GRANDES AND VENTIS / BROWSING AT BOOKSTORES WITH FAT COGNOSCENTIS!
Lisa,PRE-TENTIOUS LAUGHS AT BUNUEL RETROSPECTIVES...OUTSIDER ART MADE BY MENTAL DEFECTIVES!
Lisa,Your minds are opening! Take it home!
Lisa,"MRS. SKIN-NER IS ""MAME""!"
Lisa,"Well it's nice to see you again, Krusty, but these kids have field trip journals to write!"
Lisa,"Mr. Spuckler, wait! Is this really good for your kids?"
Lisa,"Dad, those kids aren't dumb. This show just perpetuates the stereotype that all yokels are hicks!"
Lisa,"Krusty, the Spuckler kids missed their reading class today."
Lisa,"Cletus, I think you're spending too much of the kids' earnings on yourself."
Lisa,Stop the tour!
Lisa,"Cletus, I had to stop you exploiting the children, so I sent her an e-mail."
Lisa,'Tweren't nothin'.
Lisa,"Check out this pinball machine! ""Chevy Chase in 'Foul Play'."""
Lisa,Pong!
Lisa,Pong!
Lisa,Pong!
Lisa,"Hey, Mr. Flanders, what'd you get?"
Lisa,"As always, I have some ideas."
Lisa,"Fort. That's build a ""fort."""
Lisa,What's the password?
Lisa,What if we're not here?
Lisa,"Dad, don't throw rice, it makes the birds swell up!"
Lisa,It begins.
Lisa,"Nelson, you came to our side in our hour of need."
Lisa,We did it! Now we can enjoy Boxingham Palace in peace!
Lisa,"Sure, I guess. A couple of birds pooped on it over here."
Lisa,HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR HOMER / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!
Lisa,"Dad, you're out of shape even for an American."
Lisa,"It's so hard to choose just one item worthy of the safe. So I made this elaborate decision tree, which in itself is worthy of preservation."
Lisa,I picked my Malibu Stacy hybrid convertible. It runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.
Lisa,"Dad, that's ridiculous."
Lisa,"I agree, Mom, it's very sad. But we'll have to move on -- it's not like we can restage all our family photos."
Lisa,"Ooo, there's my first saxophone recital!"
Lisa,Duffman's on a date with Booberella!
Lisa,"Yes, but why does it have to be in my bedroom?"
Lisa,It's eleven at night and I can't get to sleep!
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,"Okay, this is the place."
Lisa,No! Should I attach it for you?
Lisa,And this website will tell you the weather.
Lisa,"I'm proud of you, Mom. You're like Christopher Columbus -- you discovered something millions of people knew about before you."
Lisa,It's seven a.m.
Lisa,"Bart, it's not Saturday."
Lisa,"Dad, I'm going to play soccer."
Lisa,"I fell in love with the game when I saw ""Bend It Like Beckham."""
Lisa,"You tell him, Jesminder!"
Lisa,You already promised you would.
Lisa,What happened to the ref?
Lisa,"Dad, where'd you get that outfit?"
Lisa,"You don't even know the rules! This could be my new thing, and you're turning it into a joke!"
Lisa,"Sadly, no. I'm disappointed with the way you acted today... but I'm not surprised."
Lisa,"Dad, I'm impressed! You've become a much better referee."
Lisa,"Um, uh..."
Lisa,Ow! She tripped me. Ow! Owww!
Lisa,You can't give me a yellow card?! You're my father!
Lisa,This is what I think of your yellow card!
Lisa,"But, but..."
Lisa,"Great. The one time you actually do something right, you ruin my life."
Lisa,Not interested.
Lisa,"Gimme, gimme, gimme!"
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"Dad, I can't forgive you because there's nothing to forgive."
Lisa,"You were right to kick me out of that game. Soccer was making me insane, just as it did the continents of Europe and South America."
Lisa,So from now on I'll play soccer for the same reason I study chemistry -- for fun!
Lisa,Do you want to play a little?
Lisa,"Mom, are you sure you don't wanna play?"
Lisa,All this fuss for a baseball game? Why don't thousands come to watch a teacher inspire a child?
Lisa,Hide the sports section!
Lisa,"Bart, come with me. I'll take you to someone who will make you feel better."
Lisa,"He died, Bart. Dad buried him in the back yard. But not in that order."
Lisa,"Bart, meet Joe LaBoot."
Lisa,"Feel better now, Bart?"
Lisa,The person who hates Bart more than anyone else. Look!
Lisa,"Mom, put your glasses on."
Lisa,"Bart, stop! No one's mad at you anymore! Right?"
Lisa,Can't we?
Lisa,Are you sure?
Lisa,I think maybe we cou-ould.
Lisa,Then I guess you wouldn't mind eating one.
Lisa,Maybe it was the same person who tied each of the dog's feet to a toy car.
Lisa,I can't believe you listened to this magazine. It's a Larry Flynt publication!
Lisa,I can't -- I won't!
Lisa,Make her stop!
Lisa,Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt?
Lisa,I've read that people do strange things in their sleep when they've taken Ambien -- I mean Nappien.
Lisa,"See? ""May cause dry mouth, mood swings, and nighttime kookiness."""
Lisa,That's just someone barbecuing.
Lisa,"But Mom, the lifeguards have to know."
Lisa,"Mom, is Dad stealing from people he's supposed to help?"
Lisa,He is stealing!
Lisa,Springfield squash -- the most fibrous variety of yellow squash!
Lisa,"Dad, we're in the maze."
Lisa,"Dad, why don't you throw me in the air, and I can see which way is out."
Lisa,"Corn... More corn... Another kid getting' thrown in the air... witch's coven... Seattle Space Needle... Amateur production of ""You Can't Take It With You""... I'm getting dizzy... And corn again."
Lisa,Finally! I knew we could solve that maze using Tremaux's algorithm.
Lisa,No you didn't -- your plan was to burn the corn.
Lisa,Maybe there's something in Dad's backpack.
Lisa,A sports bra?
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,Um... I don't think he's ever thought about anything.
Lisa,"What's the matter, Bart?"
Lisa,"What if Santa's Little Helper stops being a police dog? Then he can get a non-violent job, like barking songs on novelty Christmas records. You can do it, boy!"
Lisa,"No, boy, that's Hanukah."
Lisa,Ew! He is slimy!
Lisa,I've got something!
Lisa,The sixth-grade security camera shows three empty desks!
Lisa,"Good work, Database."
Lisa,I've got a visual.
Lisa,I already read it.
Lisa,"Wait, Milhouse -- hold your position. Something doesn't add up."
Lisa,Look what the bullies could have stolen...
Lisa,Big Chief Rotten Cheeks Chewing Tobacco...a take-a-penny tray with a quarter in it!
Lisa,So why steal the yogurt? We have to find out what they're up to.
Lisa,I've lost Milhouse.
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, you know we have only one agent who stands a chance with those bullies. My brother."
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, as we both know, but you might need reminding, the annual bake sale provides ninety percent of the school's funding."
Lisa,Jimbo drew a couple of pictures of his house in second grade. But I can't vouch for their accuracy -- the teacher gave him a frowny-face.
Lisa,"Sir, we have to call off this bake sale, now!"
Lisa,"We have to find those bullies before the bake sale starts. Martin, run a top-down search on the school security grid."
Lisa,"Martin, anything?"
Lisa,So true.
Lisa,We have a fire alarm in the ventilation room!
Lisa,"I am. You're on a Bluetooth cell phone, the most vulnerable device known to man."
Lisa,A mole?!
Lisa,"Bart, are you all right? Bart?"
Lisa,"My God, that's a class-five stench-dispersal unit! We have to short out that fan."
Lisa,But you and Willie will drown!
Lisa,"Dad, that's a bomb!"
Lisa,How do I stop it?!
Lisa,"Oh, that's convenient."
Lisa,"Yeah, Dad."
Lisa,Make room for Jumbo.
Lisa,Nothing.
Lisa,"Yeah, Bart."
Lisa,"Bart's makin' faces, Dad."
Lisa,"Oh Bart, you fall for that every six months."
Lisa,"You're going to the dentist too, Dad."
Lisa,"This film is against tooth decay, but it also kind of glamorizes it. Mixed signals, hmm."
Lisa,"Dad, that's ludicrous!"
Lisa,"No! I mean Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, right here in the dental plaza!"
Lisa,Kent Brockman said a horrible swear!
Lisa,I'm not sure Brockman's out of the woods yet. There are a lot of religious watch-dog groups out there... keeping the world safe from the horror of free expression.
Lisa,And you're constantly flouting the law.
Lisa,"One thing I've always wondered: how can Fox News be so conservative, when the Fox network keeps airing raunchy shows? They don't fit together."
Lisa,Not true. You've got the guts -- and I've got a web cam! This time you can tell the truth...
Lisa,Here we go. Four-three-two...
Lisa,"Mr. Brockman, you're a huge hit!"
Lisa,World.
Lisa,One... two...
Lisa,I guess there's just no place for truth and bravery in today's media.
Lisa,"Of course. Gosh, Dad, your hands are shaking!"
Lisa,Oh my God! You don't suppose they're gonna start--
Lisa,"Hi, Dad."
Lisa,"Yay, Dad!"
Lisa,"Good luck on your first day, Dad."
Lisa,You're our hero!
Lisa,"I'm so proud of you, Dad!"
Lisa,And at least we can take the extra income you've earned in the last few months and set it aside for a rainy day.
Lisa,"Dad, all you circled were the ""I's"" and ""A's""."
Lisa,"I just want a simple salad with pine nuts, haricots verts, seasonal heirloom tomatoes..."
Lisa,"Bart, that's not a restaurant, it's somebody's house."
Lisa,Look at the crowd around that table.
Lisa,We crashed a funeral!
Lisa,We should get out of here. Come on.
Lisa,It is! Tenor Andrea Bocelli recorded an entire song on his back.
Lisa,And you contributed to our culture!
Lisa,"No, no. It's a good thing."
Lisa,The dance isn't till next week.
Lisa,"Dad, I think someone's trying to kill you!"
Lisa,I don't see anything suspicious... except someone is loudly unwrapping their candy.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,Shout!
Lisa,Shout!
Lisa,Shout!
Lisa,HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!
Lisa,A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW!
Lisa,There must be a website that can help you deal with a clingy baby.
Lisa,"Click that one, Mom. / No, go up! / Keep going, up, up, up! / The blue ones are ads! / That's the toolbar! / Now you've opened ""Word!"" Close it. / Close it, don't save it! / Stop clicking! / Don't go there! / Why are you buying a freezer?!"
Lisa,You clicked the cart!
Lisa,Creative Responses for Infant Edu-loving!
Lisa,"They come to your home to help you raise independent, self-actualized children. The counselors can come day and night because they have no families themselves."
Lisa,Dad? Where are you?
Lisa,Working? Where?
Lisa,You sound weird.
Lisa,"To be fair, the millennium just started, so it's not that big a deal... But they're giving it to me!"
Lisa,...and the Father-Daughter Dance.
Lisa,Just dance.
Lisa,"Mom, I think there's something you're trying to avoid. Or someone."
Lisa,"Whatever we did, we're sorry."
Lisa,It sounded like you were.
Lisa,Ice cream! Ice cream! / Dad's the best!
Lisa,"Oh my God, an alien! I'm gonna blow Rachel Goodman away at show-and-tell!"
Lisa,"As this month's rotating president of the Springfield Future Scientists Club, may I say: I'm sorry. And is there anything we can do to help?"
Lisa,"Fiber-optic cable, Uranium two thirty-five, two tickets to ""Avenue Q"", seven billion body bags..."
Lisa,Can I weld that?
Lisa,Way to get rid of Bart. He can be such a pest.
Lisa,They were in yesterday's New York Times!
Lisa,"Ha, you missed them! Bart and our alien friend are hundreds of miles away by now."
Lisa,I can't believe that an alien who looked so evil turned out to be bad.
Lisa,What do we do now?
Lisa,"I'm concerned we might be heading down a slippery slope. What do you think, Nelson?"
Lisa,I fed your fish.
Lisa,I warned ya. And yet my punishment is no less severe. That's odd.
Lisa,"Oh, that's great."
Lisa,"Tarantulas! I'll save you, Baby Burps-A-Lot!"
Lisa,Spider burps!
Lisa,Who is it?
Lisa,That's not the Milhouse I know.
Lisa,"Oh, Milhouse! You're very brave."
Lisa,"Milhouse, that was the bravest thing I've ever seen."
Lisa,That's so poetic.
Lisa,"Bart, Bart, Bart. You're worried you're losing Milhouse. And love is a selfish thing."
Lisa,"Oh really? The more you deny it, the more I know it's true."
Lisa,"God, that was lame! Where did you get that?!"
Lisa,"Aw, it's okay."
Lisa,I got dolphin.
Lisa,Asterix! Tintin! I heard these only existed in high school French classes.
Lisa,"Oh no, I ripped it."
Lisa,Look at all these alternative comic book creators...
Lisa,"Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman... Oh, Dan Clowes!"
Lisa,"I really identified with the girls in ""Ghost World."" They made me feel like I wasn't so alone."
Lisa,Mm-hm.
Lisa,"Mom, every workout appointment is booked up for months! We'll have to open a second Shapes. We just need to find a vacant rental property. Hmm..."
Lisa,"Dad, are you okay? I see food on your plate instead of blurring motions."
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,"And Dad, I hope you learned something from this."
Lisa,"It's ""hoist with his own petard."""
Lisa,"The TiVo is installed! Now we can watch shows, and skip the commercials!"
Lisa,Oh no we won't!
Lisa,"Mom, what are you doing?"
Lisa,No! No! Prop Eighty-Seven lets big polluters off the hook!
Lisa,"Yummy, yumma!"
Lisa,WE'RE GOING TO A REST'RANT GRAND OP'NING / WE'RE GOING TO A REST'RANT GRAND OP'NING...
Lisa,WE'RE GOING TO A REST'RANT GRAND OP'NIIIIIIIING... / BUT DON'T FILL UP ON BREAD!
Lisa,"I see no grill, oven, or food of any kind."
Lisa,That voice!
Lisa,That commercial was a trick -- specifically designed to lure our family here!
Lisa,"And ""Wes Doobner's World Famous Family Style Rib Huts"" is actually an anagram!"
Lisa,Sideshow Bob!
Lisa,You never ask what we've been up to. We went to the strawberry patch and I picked the most strawberries!
Lisa,Which one?
Lisa,"Actually, you made one. What Shakespeare really said was ""'twere well it were done quickly."""
Lisa,"Macbeth, act one, scene seven. Look it up!"
Lisa,"Look, that's Sideshow Bob's mother -- Dame Judith Underdunk! She's the greatest classical actress of her generation."
Lisa,Feet? Killing?! We gotta save Bart!
Lisa,Now!
Lisa,Bob planned this from the beginning --
Lisa,He wanted to be captured at the restaurant!
Lisa,He would never get a Shakespeare quote wrong --
Lisa,His mother was a Shakespearean actress!
Lisa,His father is a doctor...
Lisa,...so when Bob collapsed in the courtroom...
Lisa,...his father could take that opportunity to inject Bob with a powerful drug that simulated death.
Lisa,"It was a diabolical scheme, and every member of his family played a part!"
Lisa,Stop that cremation!
Lisa,I grew suspicious when I saw the casket had extra room built in for your feet.
Lisa,Why would your family pay all that extra money for the comfort of a dead man?
Lisa,But won't that just shift the burden to your children?
Lisa,That means that Springfield's presidential primary will be first in the nation! Even earlier than New Hampshire!
Lisa,I think it's exciting -- Springfield is the center of the political universe. I feel like a pundit in a think tank!
Lisa,"Look, we all care about quintile disparity, but the Democrats can't win with another prissy brainiac."
Lisa,"Mom, they're taking Ralph's candidacy seriously! This is a disaster."
Lisa,Oh dear God.
Lisa,"C'mon Lis, hop on the Wiggum Wagon. Ralph said he'd let me be Secretary of Indian burns. Here's my first official act:"
Lisa,Ow!
Lisa,And Ralph is only eight years old! It says in the Constitution you have to be thirty-five.
Lisa,"Leave him alone, you vultures!"
Lisa,Ralph and I used to date.
Lisa,"Ralph, they have no right to do this to you. They just want to use you."
Lisa,Maybe you whaaa--?
Lisa,Maybe you wouldn't be such a bad president.
Lisa,I like the sound of that.
Lisa,"Dad, I'm freezing."
Lisa,"Mom, I didn't know you went to college!"
Lisa,"You know, Mom and Dad are almost forty, and Bart is ten. That means you didn't have him until way after high school."
Lisa,We're in every kind of therapy!
Lisa,"We're in the middle of our own story, thank you."
Lisa,It seemed like twenty.
Lisa,What did I miss? How did it end?
Lisa,Goodbye! / See ya later!
Lisa,"Bart, no, it's Valentine's Day."
Lisa,In the first place... do whatever you want. I'm getting' a candy apple.
Lisa,A story suitable for children!
Lisa,I did not!
Lisa,Mo-om!
Lisa,Sounds like fun. Can I play?
Lisa,How is that fun? Fun is only fun if everyone's having fun.
Lisa,"Mom, what are you doing?"
Lisa,Do you do it with relish?
Lisa,The radio lets me contribute directly to NPR.
Lisa,"I never dreamed an American car designed in Germany, assembled in Mexico from parts made in Canada, could be so amazing."
Lisa,Dad?
Lisa,See that hippo rolling in dung? You're the dung.
Lisa,You wrote a report on it last week!
Lisa,It's disgusting!
Lisa,Now you two play nice!
Lisa,"Hey Martin, what are you doing?"
Lisa,May I join you?
Lisa,"Bart, he's not gonna get it!"
Lisa,Forget it.
Lisa,Oh my God!
Lisa,"Grab onto this! C'mon, wake up!"
Lisa,Bart! You can't just run away from this!
Lisa,But Bart...
Lisa,"Bart, Martin could be seriously hurt, or worse."
Lisa,Oh my God!
Lisa,"Hey, I was trying to help him. At worst, I'm an accomplice. I'm an accomplice!"
Lisa,"Uh... let's think about this. Martin's gone, but it was an accident. Ruining our lives won't bring him back."
Lisa,I'm saying this is worse than a million A-minuses!
Lisa,We-were-never-outside-we-were-here-all-day.
Lisa,That's-usually-true-but-in-this-case-it's-not.
Lisa,"Bart, keep it together. People are looking!"
Lisa,Don't you weasel out on me!
Lisa,"What do you mean ""what's up""? Why would something be up?"
Lisa,Idiot!
Lisa,Nothing!
Lisa,What?!
Lisa,Act like you're shopping! We can't be seen together.
Lisa,Exactly.
Lisa,Give me an Indian burn!
Lisa,Don't make me say Indian again!
Lisa,"Bart, I have a plan: we go to the morgue and come back with a hand. Put its fingerprints all over the railing..."
Lisa,"Why are you being so quiet, Bart? Are you judging me? Please don't judge me."
Lisa,I can't live with the guilt. I'm going to Martin's house... to end it all!
Lisa,Bart! No! Don't do...
Lisa,...whatever the heck you're doing.
Lisa,I can't take it anymore! The stress is killing me! I'm on a freight train to Crazytown!
Lisa,You calm down!
Lisa,What was that?
Lisa,Aren't they beautiful?
Lisa,It's a tape. Martin must've set it to go off when the chrysalises hatched.
Lisa,I thought I turned that tape off.
Lisa,"""Congratulations on purchasing the Sanyo DL30, the finest non-reversing tape player..."""
Lisa,Where is this music coming from?
Lisa,Get off me!
Lisa,His foot is caught in my button hole.
Lisa,"I almost flicked an innocent butterfly. Bart, we're turning into monsters!"
Lisa,"No, not cool! We have to do the right thing, and come clean! Listen, world! We killed Martin Prince!"
Lisa,"I'm just glad it was you who brought us in, Nelson. Remember when we used to date? If you let me go, we can get back together. I never let you cherry bomb my Malibu Stacey -- I'll let you do it now."
Lisa,I learned that beneath my goody two-shoes lie some very dark socks.
Lisa,"The last book in the series goes on sale at midnight, and we're gonna go stand in line."
Lisa,"I based my costume on the books, not the movies."
Lisa,"Angelica's first kiss, da, da, da... Subplot about her cat, who cares?... Professor Skizzletwitch is a Were-bear... And, uh, no, no he's not... Maluicious Krubb is actually Kraluicious Mubb!"
Lisa,"All is lost... Angelica uses the spell she learned in chapter six... Magic, magic, magic... All is won!"
Lisa,TV! TV! TV!
Lisa,I didn't know you cared about ballet.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,Oh. Oh.
Lisa,So what happened?
Lisa,Really? How?
Lisa,Do you think mine...
Lisa,Oh.
Lisa,"Mom, it's not too late to un-shatter your dream! Martha Graham danced well into her seventies."
Lisa,Well... she danced into her seventies.
Lisa,This is how I always stand when I tell adults what they should be doing.
Lisa,"Uh, I don't know I--"
Lisa,"I'm sorry, I got confused."
Lisa,This is so hard!
Lisa,How do you cope with it?
Lisa,"Cigarettes?! They could kill you. They did a whole episode about it on ""The Suite Life of Zach and Cody""! Zach tried to impress a girl by smoking. But she went for Cody instead! Zach's life wasn't so sweet then."
Lisa,Wowww... No! All I need to stay focused is good old-fashioned fresh air.
Lisa,Nothing like fresh air.
Lisa,Fresh air.
Lisa,I've gotten better since this morning. How could that have happened?
Lisa,I thought they were cancer sticks.
Lisa,"Look, everyone knows that cigarettes are where flavor lives and a cool choice for a hot night. But they're for losers!"
Lisa,My feminist heroes!
Lisa,"No, stop buying me leg warmers! I'm already wearing six pairs!"
Lisa,"Lisa, Mom. I'm Lisa."
Lisa,When's our next break?
Lisa,What am I doing? I don't need secondhand smoke to do ballet.
Lisa,I need firsthand smoke!
Lisa,A sturgeon is a fish.
Lisa,That's easy for you to say. You've never had to be thin and focused.
Lisa,"I'm just saying it's gonna be hard for me to quit, especially before the recital."
Lisa,Is it Bart?
Lisa,I can't -- I promised I wouldn't.
Lisa,"Well, since you cared enough to apply peer pressure..."
Lisa,"All right, that's enough!"
Lisa,I want to talk about a horrible practice afflicting millions of Americans. For years we've known how dangerous it is. It stunts your growth. And it's marketed to children. I'm talking about ballet.
Lisa,Ballet is unnatural and unfair to women. I shall now cast off the shoes of oppression!
Lisa,And I'm happy to be smoke-free -- thanks to these children's nicotine patches.
Lisa,Dad... Dad? Wake up!
Lisa,You can just drop me off here.
Lisa,"I'm delivering your Scout Gal Cookies, Mayor Quimby! That'll be thirty dollars!"
Lisa,"The money helps us serve the community! We plant trees, pick up litter, cut up milk bones for old dogs..."
Lisa,And I used rhetoric in my answer!
Lisa,Where's all the money?
Lisa,"Sir, I didn't get this ""skepticism"" merit badge falling for promises like that."
Lisa,I would strongly support that measure.
Lisa,"Panic not, fellow Springfielders!"
Lisa,"I've gone through the town's financial records, and it turns out there are millions in uncollected city taxes."
Lisa,"Hey Dad, that's the singer you used to manage!"
Lisa,Double ew!
Lisa,Ew!
Lisa,Southern-fried succubus?
Lisa,What lap?
Lisa,"KEEP IT DOWN, I'M READING ""HARRY POTTER!"""
Lisa,"Aw, cheer up, you've still got your talent, and that new song you wrote is gonna be a really big hit."
Lisa,Awww.
Lisa,Mom! We need a Callaway titanium perimeter-weighted driver!
Lisa,Banana bread!
Lisa,Bart... you do know what happens next.
Lisa,"Bart, are you all right?"
Lisa,What you heard was your conscience telling you to stop eating meat.
Lisa,"All right, so I put that there to get you to stop eating meat. But your body is going to miss the protein. So you'll have to take these pills."
Lisa,Okay. Meet me halfway -- stop stirring your lemonade with a sausage.
Lisa,Come on.
Lisa,It's a no-brainer.
Lisa,Don't worry. I called some animal activists who can help us get in. I'll just give the signal. Milk is murder!
Lisa,"Yeah, it's my code name. This is Compost. And this is Solarpanel."
Lisa,Lisa's Brother.
Lisa,Of course he did. His food is laced with growth hormones.
Lisa,Come on!
Lisa,"Wow, you did learn a lot at 4-H."
Lisa,"Well, your friend Mary from 4-H lives on a farm -- Lou can stay with her!"
Lisa,He wants to know your name.
Lisa,What's going on?
Lisa,"Bart, I'll find a way to get you out of this wedding. In the meantime, just say yes, so Lou will be safe -- look how happy he is."
Lisa,Mom! Dad! Bart's marrying one of Cletus' daughters!
Lisa,"Wait! If you stop the wedding, Bart's cow will die! And he really cares about that cow... and Bart doesn't usually care about stuff, so... help."
Lisa,I'll get your fabrics!
Lisa,"For you, Dad -- I consider that a victory."
Lisa,Anything?
Lisa,"I'm sorry, but as a filmmaker I have to face the truth."
Lisa,"Well, I guess I could cut loose and do a little homework."
Lisa,I can start working on my school video project. The assignment is to film the beauty of the everyday. So let's see...
Lisa,There's drama and inspiration everywhere I look.
Lisa,I am a born filmmaker!
Lisa,"Oh, that's a funny joke, Mr. Kinkaid. Is this an art class or a comedy class? Seriously, why is it three?"
Lisa,"Three it is! You're the teacher, and I accept your decision."
Lisa,The man is an idiot!
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, I didn't know you knew so much about film."
Lisa,They sound great... I'd love to read them sometime.
Lisa,Orlando or Hollywood?
Lisa,Yeah. Getting back to my grade...
Lisa,"Well, according to Aristotle, drama contains six elements: plot, theme, character--"
Lisa,"Okay, but can I just finish the smarty-pants answer?"
Lisa,"My family. ...Language, rhythm and spectacle."
Lisa,This is so generous. How can I ever repay you?
Lisa,"Um, okay."
Lisa,I'm making a documentary about a very special family.
Lisa,"No, us!"
Lisa,"No Dad, I want you to play Homer Simpson."
Lisa,"Okay everyone -- just be yourself. Don't look in the camera, pretend I'm not here, and... no toupees..."
Lisa,And... let's roll.
Lisa,What are you boys doing on the Foley stage?
Lisa,"Okay, one more take."
Lisa,"Dad, no!"
Lisa,My movie got in! I'm going to the Sundance Film Festival!
Lisa,I can't believe I'm a director with a movie at Sundance.
Lisa,These badges will get us into any of the independent movies playing at Sundance.
Lisa,This is it! My premiere!
Lisa,I'm Lisa Simpson. And this is my family.
Lisa,"Happy birthday, Mom."
Lisa,I didn't mean it like that! A lot of things got changed in the editing room.
Lisa,Proudly edited by Lisa Simpson!
Lisa,"Oh, I was just trying to accurately portray my unique and quirky home life."
Lisa,"Guys, guys! Look, it's a documentary -- nobody outside of this festival is ever gonna hear about it."
Lisa,I can't believe what I've done -- maybe deep down I always knew how much this film would hurt them. Maybe I'm the monster this movie exposed.
Lisa,"Oh... hi, Mr. Jarmusch."
Lisa,That doesn't sound like your kind of movie.
Lisa,"Ew... so, do you think my family will ever forgive me for making them a laughing stock?"
Lisa,Nelson? He couldn't have made a movie by himself. Who helped him?
Lisa,It's just a cat.
Lisa,"Thank you, Mr. Jarmusch -- you've taught me a valuable lesson that other people have bigger family problems than I do."
Lisa,"Well, I uh..."
Lisa,"Wow, I guess Nelson's the hot thing now. My movie will probably never be seen."
Lisa,Are you guys still mad at me?
Lisa,"Mom, you tricked us!"
Lisa,I wanna go lecture the food court businesses that are still using Styrofoam!
Lisa,I want a poodle!
Lisa,Doctor.
Lisa,Professor.
Lisa,Chef!
Lisa,CEO!
Lisa,"You know, it's a boy dolphin."
Lisa,We fooled her... Betsy.
Lisa,"Uh, Mom? We've got a code four."
Lisa,I hear noises coming from the kitchen!
Lisa,"Wow, Dad was so cute as a baby."
Lisa,"Grandma, I accept your gift."
Lisa,"It's not really avenging her, Dad. Just the fulfillment of her last wish."
Lisa,"You know, spiritually speaking, Grandma's ashes won't know where they've been thrown from... So, in a way... uh... I'm lying down now."
Lisa,We can ignite it with these crystal earrings Grandma gave me.
Lisa,I found them on her nightstand.
Lisa,What? Bart got a Swiss Army knife.
Lisa,But she'll live on forever in what you did today.
Lisa,"Yay, Bart!"
Lisa,That's not fair -- Bart was great.
Lisa,"Hey Krusty, you're making a huge mistake not hiring my brother. Why don't you hire them both? It won't cost you anything -- you could call Bart an intern."
Lisa,"In fact, the intern thing could open up a whole new world of free labor for you! Did you know the Discovery Channel doesn't have a single paid employee?"
Lisa,To make Bart a Krusketeer?
Lisa,Wha... but...
Lisa,So do a global change?
Lisa,I'll never last here.
Lisa,"Here you go, Krusty."
Lisa,Mitzi Gaynor?
Lisa,Krusty Klovnen Baby Visker?
Lisa,Yo ho ho and a bottle of fun!
Lisa,My job: making you look good.
Lisa,Long John Seltzer!
Lisa,"I don't know, I guess he forgot, but people seemed to like me last week."
Lisa,"Oh, well, it's one thing to fill in for a monkey. But a comedy legend? I wouldn't dream of it."
Lisa,"Okay, I'll do the monologue."
Lisa,"So the centipede says: ""I'm goin'! I'm goin'! ...I'm just puttin' on my shoes!"""
Lisa,"Thank you, folks -- you've been a great audience."
Lisa,I'm gonna keep this forever!
Lisa,"Yeah, sure, Mel. Let me just wave one more goodbye to my fans."
Lisa,"Oh no, the Northern Irish are also having a parade!"
Lisa,"Well, I do owe you everything... make it quick."
Lisa,I don't recognize any of them.
Lisa,Melvin van Horne... Sideshow Mel?! It's you! How could this happen to you... to all these wonderful performers?
Lisa,"I need to get out while I still can. Thank you, Mel."
Lisa,"Everyone, wait!"
Lisa,"Um, there's someone I forgot to thank, and he's here tonight. Krusty, will you come up on stage, please?"
Lisa,Really? So what else is in the news?
Lisa,I'm trying to set you up for laughs.
Lisa,It always comes down to trans-substantiation versus con-substantiation.
Lisa,Stop it! Both of you! You have a common land! A literature! And the sweetest songs on earth! TOORA LOORA LOORA -- TOORA LOORA LIE / HUSH MY LITTLE BABY / HUSH NOW DON'T YOU CRY
Lisa,TOORA LOORA LOORA
Lisa,TOORA LOORA LIE
Lisa,"Hey, what are those boxes in the back?"
Lisa,See ya!
Lisa,What'd you get for me?
Lisa,"Dad, is this from a meth lab?"
Lisa,This is evidence.
Lisa,Because you love the taste of my imaginary tea.
Lisa,Here's an imaginary cell phone.
Lisa,"And I'm never gonna go to Machu Picchu. In this family, you get used to disappointments."
Lisa,What are you two doing in the laundry room?
Lisa,"Dad, do laundry."
Lisa,Tracking software? You're spying on Bart!
Lisa,Bart! There's something I need to tell you! Mom and Dad have been--
Lisa,"It's me, you idiot."
Lisa,Mom and Dad are spying on you. There's a tracking chip in your cell phone!
Lisa,I know! It's a complete violation of your rights. Not to mention--
Lisa,Something about this just doesn't seem right.
Lisa,"I think we're following you. What's your species, little guy?"
Lisa,"Ooh, you're a scarlet tanager. You've been flying south, because you're migrating to... Machu Picchu, Peru!"
Lisa,"Well, I could tell Mom and Dad the chip is in the bird and hope they take me to Machu Picchu another time, or..."
Lisa,Mom! Dad! Bart's on the move!
Lisa,You guys look exhausted. Maybe you oughta rest for a while.
Lisa,Where's Maggie?
Lisa,Mom! Bart's flicking boogers on me!
Lisa,That was an odd thing for Bart to say.
Lisa,My family's here!
Lisa,"Bart, what are you doing?"
Lisa,Huh.
Lisa,"Okay, listen, you. I don't know who you are or what you've done with the real Bart. But... God help me, I want him back."
Lisa,The real Bart would've thrown me out the window.
Lisa,You're just digging yourself even deeper.
Lisa,"Mom, ""Bart"" has something to tell you."
Lisa,"Boy, Aspen sure is ritzy. Even the winos look better."
Lisa,There's Bart!
Lisa,"Mom, you said all hitchhikers were drug-crazed thrill seekers."
Lisa,They're worse than wal-king!
Lisa,I'll take ten bucks no-ow.
Lisa,"We won, he's asleep!"
Lisa,Why can't you just admit we're lost?
Lisa,Just ask those guys for directions.
Lisa,"Excuse me, boys! My brother is lost, and kind of a jerk. If he'd brought a map of the grounds as I suggested, then we would--"
Lisa,"Oh, Bart. Don't say things you can't take back."
Lisa,Oh great. Now you woke the baby.
Lisa,"My God, Bart, what happened to us?"
Lisa,It's not a pedal boat. It's a pedal car that Bart drove into the river. Because he knows a shortcut that's not on the map.
Lisa,"If it's your shortcut, I'll be high and dry."
Lisa,It's true! He's not bluffing!
Lisa,Ow.
Lisa,"What are we, a piano bar?"
Lisa,I guess.
Lisa,Um... I think it's... we don't have one.
Lisa,Not anymore!
Lisa,Maybe you could use some help.
Lisa,": FDR's middle name... ""DELANO."" ""Oxidized surface""... Well that's ""RUSTY."" ""Bartenders serve them 'dirty'""..."
Lisa,"No, ""MARTINIS""."
Lisa,One more word!
Lisa,"""Singer of Yentl"", thirteen letters... um..."
Lisa,"I've got it! ""ISAAC BASHEVIS!"""
Lisa,Now gimme my license! Give everyone their license!
Lisa,"Bart, I've fallen in love with crosswords!"
Lisa,"FRUIT LOOPS? That's the answer to thirty-eight down: ""toucan's delight!"""
Lisa,"COCOA! ""Ice rink drink!"""
Lisa,"LOSIN' IT! ""Risqué '80s teen flick!"""
Lisa,"""EYE CARE!"" ""Optician's concern."" Oh, thanks for your help, Bart! ""BART?"" ""San Francisco people mover!"""
Lisa,"Guess what, Mom? I'm a cruciverbalist!"
Lisa,"Probably, but a cruciverbalist is a fan of crossword puzzles -- which I am!"
Lisa,"Grampa, everyone knows that the only real test of skill is the New York Times puzzle, edited by Will Shortz!"
Lisa,"Okay, back to the real world."
Lisa,Isn't it beautiful?
Lisa,I... I made them into a crossword.
Lisa,Bald Man's Basketball League?
Lisa,Citywide crossword tournament!
Lisa,"Ooh, thank you!"
Lisa,Cruciverbalists from far and wide have gathered here for a no-holds-barred test of skill.
Lisa,"No, none."
Lisa,I win!
Lisa,"Dad, I could actually win this thing!"
Lisa,"My only fear is, I always sabotage myself when I'm on the verge of happiness."
Lisa,"In my young life I've seen that every time I'm about to achieve true happiness, some little piece of me says ""you don't deserve this."" And another little piece says ""I agree."""
Lisa,"With my luck, I bet it will. It's practically a sure thing."
Lisa,Wish me luck.
Lisa,"Oh, that's so sad!"
Lisa,"Hey, there are no lenses in these glasses..."
Lisa,I blew it again.
Lisa,And there's something different about him.
Lisa,He bought new shoelaces. With fancy metal tips!
Lisa,Dad? Did you come into some money we don't know about?
Lisa,You got highlights in your hair!
Lisa,And your car antenna has been straightened and re-balled.
Lisa,What's goin' on?
Lisa,"No, I'm not mad."
Lisa,"No, I'm not mad."
Lisa,"No, I'm not mad."
Lisa,"You stopped being my Daddy as soon as you bet against me! All I have now is a mom, which is why I'm taking her maiden name! From now on, I'm..."
Lisa,Lisa Bouvier!
Lisa,"Hey, Bouvier was Jackie Kennedy's maiden name."
Lisa,Well what did you think her name was before it was Kennedy?
Lisa,I'm through with crosswords! My innocence died in those four hundred and forty-one little boxes.
Lisa,A couple hours? I can do the Sunday puzzle in less than one hour!
Lisa,A couple of hours...
Lisa,"""Last clue: ""Loses on purpose"". Hmmm... ""DIETS!"" Oh, Will Shortz, you clever rascal."
Lisa,And a new record time! Wait a second...
Lisa,"""DUMB DAD SORRY FOR HIS BET."" Wow, it's almost as if Dad planted that message. No, it must just be a weird coincidence...but what if it's not? Oh, it must be...or mustn't it not?"
Lisa,"Dad, I know this is crazy, but did you plant a message to me in the New York Times crossword puzzle?"
Lisa,New York Times Crossword Editor Will Shortz!
Lisa,And master puzzle constructor Merl Reagle?!
Lisa,"Well I must admit, I'm kind of touched. ""DUMB DAD SORRY FOR HIS BET."" Nice."
Lisa,I didn't?!
Lisa,"Oh, Dad."
Lisa,And they've already started exploiting the next holiday.
Lisa,Um... I'm also returning this kitten calendar.
Lisa,"Mom, Dad! Our mall got a Mapple store!"
Lisa,It's so sterile! MyPods... MyPhones... A Brainiac Bar!
Lisa,"I can't afford any of your products, but can I buy some fake white earbuds, so people will think I have a MyPod?"
Lisa,"Oh, I'll never get a Mapple anything."
Lisa,"Thank you, Krusty!"
Lisa,I'm a Mapple person!
Lisa,Sorry.
Lisa,Yeah.
Lisa,It was my brother Bart!
Lisa,"I've already downloaded so much incredible music! Check out ""Moon Dreams"" from Miles Davis' ""Birth of the Cool."""
Lisa,"Or, check out this MyTunes-exclusive episode of ""Itchy and Scratchy."""
Lisa,It's a gift from Mapple!
Lisa,"Oh, such beautiful packaging! I never thought a company could be my soul mate!"
Lisa,"Oh, it's my first MyBill. Twelve hundred dollars?! But I only downloaded... twelve hundred and twelve songs!"
Lisa,"Um, Mr. Mobbs... I sort of downloaded too many songs onto my MyPod. And I don't have the money to pay for them. And... do you think you could consider a reduced payment plan?"
Lisa,Can't you open your Mapple menu and click on the compassion bar? Oh please?
Lisa,Would I ever!
Lisa,Think differently... Think differently... Think differently... Think differently...
Lisa,Save yourselves!
Lisa,Huh? Where are the bees?
Lisa,All the bees are dead!
Lisa,"Willie, I didn't know you were an apiarist."
Lisa,"Dad, we have to do something -- all the bees are dying!"
Lisa,"But Dad, bees pollinate flowers."
Lisa,No bees means no honey...
Lisa,Bees.
Lisa,How do we catch her without hurting her?
Lisa,How long is that?
Lisa,"It's not for long. But until they find a suitable habitat, this beard is the only hope for these bees."
Lisa,"Actually, bees rarely sting when they're in a cluster. They only attack to defend their hive."
Lisa,Please let me keep them for just a little longer.
Lisa,"Dad, don't eat the bees!"
Lisa,"Oh Mom, it's perfect!"
Lisa,"Go, live your lives, get off my face!"
Lisa,"Oh, I miss them."
Lisa,You'll always have Bart. Always.
Lisa,Always.
Lisa,"Ooh, another Grobanite!"
Lisa,"Mr. Burns, you can't do this!"
Lisa,"There's only one place in town where the bees can survive. And Mr. Burns wants to tear it down. Please, people. You didn't listen to me about the snail darter, you didn't listen to me about the osprey, and you didn't listen to me about the javelina."
Lisa,Apparently not feisty enough. Future generations will judge us by how we cared for the tiniest creatures. I am not just asking you to save the bees. I am asking you to save your souls.
Lisa,You don't?
Lisa,Nay.
Lisa,"I know it's not your fault, Muk Mu. You're a gentle, loving soul."
Lisa,"Mr. Burns took away their sanctuary, and now they aren't strong enough to survive on their own."
Lisa,I'm going home. Give me the keys to my bike lock.
Lisa,Give me the keys!
Lisa,"Wow, this must be important, Dad! I've never seen you walk up an incline before."
Lisa,My bees?
Lisa,They sound awfully mad. Are they dangerous?
Lisa,To that new stadium that looks exactly like a hive!
Lisa,"Oh, they've found a home."
Lisa,You're older. Why don't you do these fun activities?
Lisa,Do we have any more paints? My orange isn't the orange of that orange.
Lisa,"Lower your expectations, Lisa. Public program, public program..."
Lisa,"Um, excuse me, but I think her painting is very imaginative."
Lisa,"Yes, I would. Class, everyone please stop and admire Juliet's painting..."
Lisa,See ya!
Lisa,"So, how come I've never seen you around the Janet L. Muñoz-Robbins Rec Center before?"
Lisa,Kinda. Let's do some Groban.
Lisa,"I need some candy for a first playdate, but I don't want to come on too strong."
Lisa,"Well... if I pick plain she'll think I'm cheap, but if I pick peanut, she may have an allergy. You just killed her, Bart!"
Lisa,"What is this, Brooklyn in the fifties? Don't just say stuff."
Lisa,"Finally, a real suggestion!"
Lisa,"Hi, Juliet."
Lisa,I don't know -- it's been so long since I've had a playdate. Not that I couldn't get one if I wanted...
Lisa,Does it get you into special exhibits?
Lisa,That's today!
Lisa,"Hey Mom, can Juliet sleep over?"
Lisa,Juliet's father is the world's foremost John Grisham scholar.
Lisa,"Now we need a name for our imaginary kingdom -- I mean, queendom."
Lisa,"Equalia. Where everyone is equal, but we're in charge. I mean, somebody has to be, right?"
Lisa,Gosh. This is all happening so fast. I don't know what to say.
Lisa,I'd love to!
Lisa,"I have a best friend! You heard me say that, didn't you?"
Lisa,"We're still cool though, right?"
Lisa,My best friend is so cool!
Lisa,"Mom, I'm meeting Juliet after school!"
Lisa,"We're at the end of chapter four. But we need a grabber, a whammy, a snap-a-roo, some eye mustard... I've got it! How 'bout this? What if Queen Helvetica found a rare two-horned unicorn!"
Lisa,I love your accent. Two-nicorn. You are definitely doing the book on tape.
Lisa,And Queens Valedictoria and Helvetica hid their beloved two-nicorn from the hungry ogre Homeroni.
Lisa,I'll go get her!
Lisa,Juliet? Are you okay?
Lisa,See who?
Lisa,"Juliet, you're scaring me just a little--"
Lisa,A two-nicorn!
Lisa,"Mom, please don't do that."
Lisa,"Mom, stop! This is our thing, not yours!"
Lisa,It's better if you don't.
Lisa,I can't see Juliet anymore?! I thought you wanted me to have a best friend.
Lisa,"Well, you can't keep Juliet and me apart! I'll... I'll disobey!"
Lisa,Juliet! What are you doing here?
Lisa,"I'd love to! Oh, but I'm supposed to attend the Model U.N. this weekend. I'm the delegate from Azerbaijan, and I'm threatening a rice tariff!"
Lisa,Okay... best friend.
Lisa,How did you find this place?
Lisa,You know what I think killed this place? No one wanted to drive to the middle of the forest for clams.
Lisa,"Juliet, I'm scared."
Lisa,Equalia is not real!
Lisa,Yeah.
Lisa,"So the armies of the gnomes and the elves faced off on either side of the hollow, broad axes poised."
Lisa,A battle to determine the fate of Equalia. But you wouldn't be interested.
Lisa,Isn't that a little clichéd?
Lisa,"Yes! I mean, yes -- there are dragons everywhere! Green ones, Chinese ones, chubby bald ones..."
Lisa,And so the queens--
Lisa,Danced the minuet of equality on a gossamer dewdrop.
Lisa,"Looks like. Juliet, I don't want to go to Equalia anymore."
Lisa,"It's a special place, but I need to live in the real world."
Lisa,"Goodbye, Juliet."
Lisa,Cu-ckoo!
Lisa,...we have received your manuscript 'The Chronicles of Equalia'...
Lisa,"""...unfortunately, it is not what we're looking for at this time. Thank you for thinking of us."""
Lisa,So you're saying he'll look like you in ten days?
Lisa,"Dad, you ran for Class President?"
Lisa,He's not crying and he's not known for clowning.
Lisa,Vance Connor...
Lisa,Homer Simpson...
Lisa,Vance Connor...
Lisa,Homer Simpson...
Lisa,Vance Connor...
Lisa,Homer Simpson.
Lisa,Please stop doing that.
Lisa,Both. Homer Simpson... Vance Connor... Fonzie... Homer Simpson... and the winner is Homer Simpson!
Lisa,"Dad, just because you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would have been better."
Lisa,"As a rational skeptic, I find that hard to believe. Also, as a vegetarian, I hope there's not meat in that sauce."
Lisa,"No, that's it."
Lisa,"Aha! So Dad's life would actually have been worse, because he wouldn't have gotten together with Mom, his one true love!"
Lisa,Aha!
Lisa,So Dad's life would have been the same! He would have married Mom and worked for Mr. Burns. It would have been a push!
Lisa,Can you keep her quiet?
Lisa,"I was describing beautiful fish, Bart!"
Lisa,"I don't know, but he's algaefying."
Lisa,Why does he think Alfred's friends with Batman?
Lisa,"Yep. In the future, people will look at this and they'll say ""whoever he was, he must've mattered."""
Lisa,How 'bout Italian?
Lisa,"Woo-hoo! Test day at last! Now I can show off at a Federal level. Hey Bart, on the practice test yesterday, what did you pick as the best title for the paragraph about ""Manifest Destiny?"""
Lisa,"Dad, Bart's throwing away his future!"
Lisa,I waaarned you.
Lisa,How did I do?
Lisa,What did I get wrong?
Lisa,"Several?! That's more than ""a few"" and almost ""a bunch!"""
Lisa,"No, but wait. I aced the Math part, right? Because..."
Lisa,"Pride is to ""downfall"" as ""overconfidence"" is to..."
Lisa,They're all equally valid! But that can't be. In life everything only has one answer!
Lisa,This test penalizes guessing.
Lisa,"Well, that's it."
Lisa,The test is almost over and I haven't done a thing. I've blown my whole future.
Lisa,"Oh well, maybe it'll be more fun to be a regular, average, stay-at-home..."
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,Hooray! I'm a brainy outcast again!
Lisa,"Fine, but I wish you'd picked an easier theme than ""Super-Jet Dinosaur Fun-Monkeys."" What does that even mean?"
Lisa,Did you remember to disconnect it first?
Lisa,This is so hard because I always thought Mom was the strong one.
Lisa,"FOR HE'S A FABULOUS FLANDERS, WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY!"
Lisa,"Okay, everyone squeeze in."
Lisa,"Hey, Dad."
Lisa,"You want a cookie, Dad?"
Lisa,"Hm, I wonder if it's theses."
Lisa,"Dad, we've been trapped in the house for days. Can't we play outside?"
Lisa,"Right, 'cause I wouldn't want to be gay like my heroes Billie Jean King, Susan Sontag, Sappho of Lesbos, and, I suspect, Peppermint Patty..."
Lisa,"There's a lesson here: life is fickle. You should appreciate every... stop kicking, Bart!"
Lisa,This is the lowest we've sunk.
Lisa,"Okay, people, we've hit penumbra. Brace yourself for umbra."
Lisa,"But Mom, you'll miss the eclipse."
Lisa,"We have totality, people!"
Lisa,For years... for years...
Lisa,Dad! Come in the kitchen! Quick!
Lisa,"Wait, I have an idea! One of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent."
Lisa,"Dad, leave -- so I can get into character."
Lisa,Hello. I'm a poor little sinner who's lost her way. May I join your order?
Lisa,Can't get enough.
Lisa,Where's Maggie?
Lisa,"Mother Superior, are those all the babies in our orphanage?"
Lisa,"No, I was just thinking you might have some in the back you haven't put out yet."
Lisa,"Well, more of a curious George."
Lisa,Why would Mother Superior lie to me about not having Maggie? What is going on?
Lisa,A jewel! Why would nuns want a jewel?
Lisa,The jewel will lead me to my baby sister? Why are you telling me this?
Lisa,You mean an increasingly difficult series of challenges to my intellect? That's so cool.
Lisa,Oh sure.
Lisa,Hm...
Lisa,"Quaerite Deum in corde et anima. That's Latin... ""Deum"" is God... and of course ""Quaerite"" means ""seek""... ""Seek God with heart and soul."""
Lisa,Heart and Soul...
Lisa,I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU / HEART AND SOUL...
Lisa,A cryptic message! Maybe this will lead me to the gem!
Lisa,"Hmm, what if I read every other word? ""One more time, you're hopeless. Try again, numb skull."" That's not very nice -- I will try again, but not because the wall told me to. ""Turn around. Seek Springfield's biggest man-made ring."""
Lisa,Big ring... big ring...
Lisa,So many rings! But which one is the key to finding the gem?
Lisa,Well? Did you get it?
Lisa,The biggest ring in Springfield...comes from the bell in the Springfield Bell Tower!
Lisa,Ha! Principal Skinner? Comic Book Guy? What are you doing here?
Lisa,"Oh. Well, I seek it so I can find my sister. How do you know about the gem?"
Lisa,Tell me all you know about the gem.
Lisa,Does your mother know you're using her minivan?
Lisa,That's tonight!
Lisa,Because I cleverly deduced the answer to Springfield's biggest ring. Voila!
Lisa,"Oh my God. I know what the biggest ""ring"" in ""Springfield"" is. It's been right in front of us the whole time."
Lisa,Mr. Burns! What are you doing here?
Lisa,"Look -- there's writing on the ""R!"""
Lisa,From this angle they're words!
Lisa,Great...
Lisa,"Crimes... ""Kill"" ""Holy""... ""Sage""..."
Lisa,"No, that's not it! A secret message this awkwardly-worded is always an anagram."
Lisa,"So, the anagram spells: ""Regally, the rock gem is..."""
Lisa,...Lisa?
Lisa,Does kissing Milhouse count?
Lisa,It all adds up. I am the gem that will bring world peace! How brilliant of God to remove my skepticism by making me his chosen one!
Lisa,Look who's here!
Lisa,"Oh, fine, fine, finish your song. I can be patient -- after all, I am the gem child."
Lisa,Maggie?
Lisa,"No, no, no -- the solution was ""Regally the rock gem is Lisa""."
Lisa,Um... this one?
Lisa,"It's really Maggie, Sherlock. You know, I have to point out that this anagram only works if I get the wrong answer first."
Lisa,Maggie -- it's true! You are the Gem Child!
Lisa,Mom! How did you know Maggie was here?
Lisa,"Mom, wait! Maggie is the gem child! She's brought peace to our town! And reports of less road rage in Shelbyville! She has to stay here!"
Lisa,You told me we were gonna pick up trash by the freeway!
Lisa,Well that sucked! / There's a day we'll never get back! / I was so bored.
Lisa,I was so bored!
Lisa,I'll be less stressed! And I'm really freakin' stressed!
Lisa,"Hm. There was a note on the fridge marked ""urgent."" Funny word: ""urgent."" ""Urrrgent."" Urgent."
Lisa,"Sorry we missed your special day, Grampa. We'll definitely go next year."
Lisa,Dunkilderry is so quaint! It looks like the puzzle at the pediatrician's office.
Lisa,"Well, Ireland is at the forefront of Europe's tech boom."
Lisa,This broadcast is from 1979.
Lisa,"Don't you mean ""pint""?"
Lisa,Fifty-fifty?
Lisa,"""At McEllis Island, returning immigrants who are sick of America are processed by Irish authorities."""
Lisa,"Ooh, it must be Bloomsday!"
Lisa,"Every June sixteenth, lovers of James Joyce follow the route traveled by Leopold Bloom in the novel ""Ulysses."""
Lisa,"Pretty much, yeah."
Lisa,"You were born while they were married so legally, no. But in the sense someone calls you one when they're angry, yes."
Lisa,I think it's romantic. You can pretend you're newlyweds starting a life together.
Lisa,That's the angry one.
Lisa,"I don't understand. Dad would never miss an open bar with chicken wings. Plus he loves Mom, and us, yada, yada, yada."
Lisa,Sideshow Bob!
Lisa,He ruined the wedding -- getting his revenge on us at last!
Lisa,Sideshow Bob! Drop that knife and give back our Dad!
Lisa,Fine. But how do you explain this?
Lisa,Mom! Mom! We know where Dad is!
Lisa,We know it was you Selma Bouvier.
Lisa,We don't want your cookies.
Lisa,"Dad, do you have any idea what's gotten into Maggie?"
Lisa,Yes you do.
Lisa,"When you say it, it's not just in your head."
Lisa,"Math, done. Pine cone, collected. Permission slip, signed. Now time for a break -- a little social studies."
Lisa,What will Springfield be like in fifty years? Let's see what the computer says:
Lisa,That's horrible. What else?
Lisa,Oh my God!
Lisa,It just gets worse and worse.
Lisa,"Oh Ralph, how I envy your optimism. There is no Springfield fifty years in the future! With global warming trapping the CO2 inside our poisonous atmosphere, our super-heated oceans will rise, drowning our lowlands, leaving what's left of humanity baking in deserts that once fed the world!"
Lisa,"And in the new Nineveh , darkness falls."
Lisa,What's therapy gonna do for me when the world is in ashes?
Lisa,"Oh, go ahead -- numb me."
Lisa,"Well, off to school where they'll prepare our little minds for a future we'll never see."
Lisa,I'm going to Dizzyland!
Lisa,"Hello, Smiley Face. Hello, Smiley Face."
Lisa,"If you don't stop smiling, you're gonna get a kiss!"
Lisa,"Bart, in my concurrent adventure, I learned a really important lesson: you can't wallow in despair. Face things as they really are."
Lisa,"Wow, the Truth in Boardwalking Law has really done a number on this place."
Lisa,"Dad, no!"
Lisa,"Yeah, sure. It's complimentary."
Lisa,Cinco.
Lisa,"Dad, I've got the perfect thing."
Lisa,It's mac and cheese from the school cafeteria. The blandest food known to man.
Lisa,Tofu cubes... tidy Joes... chili con cottage cheese...
Lisa,Pecan blandies... cream of steam... You Guess 'Ems...
Lisa,Old comedy writers who now have to work at our kitchen.
Lisa,"Um, do you mind if I join you?"
Lisa,"Baked potato, side salad and a--"
Lisa,Is this seat taken?
Lisa,"Dad, if I join a clique, I'll be the kind of person I hate."
Lisa,"Hmm, well, they are good ones."
Lisa,"Dad, I don't want to hurt people's feelings."
Lisa,I'm a big girl! I'm a big girl!
Lisa,One of you said something bad about the other.
Lisa,"I've never been called ""fierce"" before. ""Strident..."" ""hectoring"" has been tossed around..."
Lisa,Confirm.
Lisa,"I'm sorry, Dad. These girls are nice on the surface, but it's hard work staying this shallow. I hope you understand."
Lisa,"No, there's a middle ground."
Lisa,Not if you use a dimmer switch.
Lisa,"Look at this: Springfield Elementary's rating is so low, it's more than two standard deviations below the norm."
Lisa,"Oh, their school system's the best. Their auditorium and their gym are two different rooms!"
Lisa,"I just wish I could go to a school like that -- even for one week. ""Tis better to have learned and lost then never to have learned at all."""
Lisa,"Mom, that's brilliant! We could go to a school where special doesn't always mean bad! And where the teachers don't have to moonlight as telemarketers."
Lisa,Look at this place. It's everything I've ever dreamed of: On-campus stables!
Lisa,Field trips to Europe!
Lisa,"Ooh, a doctorate!"
Lisa,Principal Skinner?
Lisa,I'm Lisa. One word.
Lisa,"Uh, who's Alaska Nebraska?"
Lisa,"I should warn you: by using the term ""lame,"" you're violating the Americans With Disabilities Act."
Lisa,B plus?!
Lisa,"But I always get A's. At my old school, I got so many A's, the teachers didn't even check my work."
Lisa,"Bart, at this school, I'm not a brain, I'm not popular, I'm not anything!"
Lisa,"Hi, Caitlin."
Lisa,Bart! Your plan worked!
Lisa,Hi.
Lisa,Really?
Lisa,Did you just wink at me?
Lisa,I didn't think I'd get a fresh start like this till junior high!
Lisa,"L'Ecole, c'est moi!"
Lisa,Even the Ralph of this school speaks French!
Lisa,"Caitlin, hi! Do a reading at your bat mitzvah? A sheynam dank!"
Lisa,"Well, if it's sold out, even Alaska Nebraska's best friend couldn't do anything about that. Can't build more seats!"
Lisa,"Alaska, we've never met, but everyone thinks I'm your best friend."
Lisa,Could you?
Lisa,You have a show?
Lisa,"Look, can you please, please, help a poor little girl who was just trying to fit in? It's what half your songs are about."
Lisa,That's amazing.
Lisa,"You know, I think those shirts should say ""insecurity."""
Lisa,"Because if you feel you have to put what you are on your shirt, then I feel sorry for you. Do you feel sorry for me? Guess not."
Lisa,"People, I'm not who you think I am. I'm just a transfer student who wanted to make some friends. Yes, I lied to you, but you only liked me because of a lie. So if you think about it--"
Lisa,Mom! Dad! I have to leave Waverly Hills and never come back!
Lisa,"Please, I just want to go back to a place where I'm ostracized for being me, not for who I pretend to be."
Lisa,"Mom, I'm glad you brought me here, but isn't it more important for a woman to be smart and powerful than beautiful?"
Lisa,Please don't say a man.
Lisa,"Thank you, but I know a story of a dangerous obsession with female beauty. It's called ""Snow White and the Seven..."""
Lisa,"Excuse me, but Snow White is a fairytale from hundreds of years ago. No one owns that."
Lisa,Yes. But they're my own original creation.
Lisa,There's Crabby...Drunky...Hungry!
Lisa,...Greedy!
Lisa,...Lenny!
Lisa,...and Doc...tor Hibbert.
Lisa,"Little did they know, their lives are about to be changed forever by a wicked queen."
Lisa,So Snow White slept and waited for her prince to come... but he never did.
Lisa,"Because a woman shouldn't have to depend on a man. Snow White was brought back to life, by a lady doctor."
Lisa,"Well, she couldn't indulge in strenuous activities like handball, but otherwise she was fine."
Lisa,Looks like Maggie wants a story too.
Lisa,"Mom, isn't that book the bible of right-wing losers?"
Lisa,"Well, I qualified for the National Math Bee--"
Lisa,Although there were a few holes in the story.
Lisa,I thought you were studying the Lincoln-Douglas debates?
Lisa,No one even plays four-square anymore -- they just gossip.
Lisa,I dunno -- chasing ducks? Buried alive? He'll be missed. Let's move. I've gotta collect pine cones.
Lisa,"Just follow the ""dies,"" Mom."
Lisa,"Someone's gotta stop her from going through with this fight. This goes against every feminist bone in my body, but Dad, can't you control your woman?"
Lisa,"Mom, I came here to tell you it's not too late to back out."
Lisa,There must be a better way.
Lisa,"Dad, I keep telling you, that won't work."
Lisa,"Hey Bart, did you know that's a haiku?"
Lisa,Two drunk guys were fighting outside and everyone went to watch.
Lisa,Yeah?
Lisa,You're on.
Lisa,"Congratulations, Hubert. Or should I congratulate your tutor: Amelia, at the Homework Factory! Your victory is tainted! Asterisk! Asterisk!"
Lisa,Asterisk! Asterisk! Asterisk!
Lisa,Stupid Miss Hoover.
Lisa,I don't want to talk about it.
Lisa,I do.
Lisa,"Interesting. With no obvious motive, no one would suspect us."
Lisa,Thanks... but I'll pass.
Lisa,"Listen, you're a persistent fellow, but I--"
Lisa,I'm in.
Lisa,"Bart, have you established your alibi?"
Lisa,And people will remember you were there?
Lisa,Crisscross.
Lisa,You should've seen the look on Krabappel's face!
Lisa,You killed her?
Lisa,"I never said ""kill!"""
Lisa,"Well, I didn't kill Mrs. Krabappel!"
Lisa,"Yeah, ding-dong-ditch!"
Lisa,You're a monster!
Lisa,That's it? Just t.p. her?
Lisa,I think I'm gonna be sick.
Lisa,Bart?!
Lisa,"Sorry Bart, I couldn't do it! There's got to be another way."
Lisa,"What if I gave you homework help? I won't give you the answers, but I'll give you the tools to find the answers yourself."
Lisa,Why would Willie do that?
Lisa,"All right, Bart... I guess I have no choice. I have to kill... you!"
Lisa,"It's pronounced ""D.N.A.,"" you idiot. And we are not the same -- I am not a murderer, and I never will be!"
Lisa,"It was an accident, I swear!"
Lisa,Cows eating cows?! That's an abomination!
Lisa,"Dad, no! That's the last book in the world!"
Lisa,"Yes, and-- Oh, go ahead."
Lisa,"Oh my God. If Bart could eat the burger and survive, then maybe he can yield the key to an anti-muncher vaccine!"
Lisa,"Apu, how did you survive?"
Lisa,"Oh, did the chosen one hurt his chosen little noggin?"
Lisa,"Dad, are you becoming a muncher?"
Lisa,"Time has passed. Children play in the streets. At night, there is music and laughter."
Lisa,And all we had to do was let Bart take a bath in our food.
Lisa,Sorry -- I have a tea party at Janey's.
Lisa,"Well, there's only one game we can play in the car over and over and over again. ""Bonk It."""
Lisa,Possum?!
Lisa,"So, I'll hide and you guys count to a hundred."
Lisa,This is the best hiding place. They'll never find me.
Lisa,I'm here! Come find me! Olly-olly-oxen-free! Olly-olly-oxen-free!
Lisa,Why did I do Poetry Club instead of Girl Scouts? Why did I do Poetry Club instead of Girl Scouts?
Lisa,You're gonna be so embarrassed. There are two other people at this party dressed just like you.
Lisa,My name's Lisa and I was playing hide and seek when I met you ladies. Please don't hurt me.
Lisa,"Uh-huh, what's an esbat?"
Lisa,You mean... witches?
Lisa,"Well I'm glad you're not ""witches."" Wouldn't want you to ""cast a spell"" on me."
Lisa,"Sure they do. If magic was real, I'd use it to get out of my pipe cleaner art project that's due tomorrow."
Lisa,Dad! Over here!
Lisa,I have one minute to avoid my first late assignment ever. The pipe cleaner fur is coming off on my hands!
Lisa,What happened to Miss Hoover?
Lisa,Spell? Those girls couldn't have made her sick... or could they?
Lisa,Did you girls make Miss Hoover sick?
Lisa,"Listen, not that I've lost my skepticism, but I am interested in learning more about Wiccans. Are you a minority group as defined by Ivy League admissions?"
Lisa,What else ya got?
Lisa,I worship nature!
Lisa,"Well, it is an honor to be asked. But I never make a final decision in the middle of a forest at night."
Lisa,"Um, it's the wiccan home page."
Lisa,I'm thinking of joining.
Lisa,"Hey, every witch needs a familiar..."
Lisa,"I'm gonna put a spell on you! Yes I am, my tuna-breath familiar."
Lisa,"Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! I curse you, Hell's Kitten!"
Lisa,With perfect faith and perfect love.
Lisa,They're not evil! They believe in friendship and respecting the earth... and they made me feel like I belonged.
Lisa,Don't dip those Wiccans!
Lisa,They didn't blind anyone -- I have proof!
Lisa,When my father was attending the moonshine competition last Saturday...
Lisa,"You heard sirens, which you thought were the police coming to arrest you. To ditch their stills...the moonshiners pushed them down a hill. The moonshine landed in a river, temporarily blinding anyone or anything that drank it."
Lisa,That river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind.
Lisa,"No, thank you. I've been rational but nerdy my whole life. But these past few weeks, you girls made me feel cool. Cool! Me! Lisa Simpson!"
Lisa,Change it! Change it!
Lisa,You just increased the volume!
Lisa,Global warming can cause weather at both extremes -- hot and cold.
Lisa,"Really? Really? Uh-huh, all right."
Lisa,"When Maggie's nightlight goes out, her onesie becomes a funsie. This announcer has never seen diapers so dapper!"
Lisa,What do you want?
Lisa,"Fine. Get this on in two minutes, lose the attitude, and for God's sake, suck in that pooch."
Lisa,"Go, go, go!"
Lisa,"And now, making his debut on the catwalk... Bartholomew!"
Lisa,"Belt is by Twizzler, vest courtesy of Nelson, tights are by Hello Kitty..."
Lisa,Because you envy us. Maggie and I share the deepest bond there is: sisterhood.
Lisa,"We'll be closer than best friends for the rest of our lives. But you'll never know what that's like, because you won't ever have a brother."
Lisa,"""Off with their heads!"" said the Red Queen. Now, pull the tab."
Lisa,More... more...
Lisa,More...
Lisa,"You can have mine, but he's kind of an idiot."
Lisa,"Two brothers? Bart, who is this kid?"
Lisa,"Bart, you have to take him back!"
Lisa,"Hello, Bart."
Lisa,You left a trail of lost winter clothes.
Lisa,"No, I'm gonna convince you to turn yourselves in."
Lisa,"Never, huh? What are you gonna eat?"
Lisa,"Better change your mind quick, Bart. A snow plow's coming to seal us in."
Lisa,"And, Bart, maybe Charlie can't be your little brother, but you'll always be a big brother to me."
Lisa,Oh no! You took too long to make an obvious decision!
Lisa,"Oh, gross, gross, gross, gross."
Lisa,I wish I weren't.
Lisa,I wanna do that!
Lisa,Slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.
Lisa,...Clark Gable owes me a book. And he never paid me for the shoeshine. But his big blue eyes could melt the butter you kept in your pocket for lunch. Lunch butter we called it.
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,"If you're not gonna take care of him right, then give him to me."
Lisa,I do! It enrages me!
Lisa,I'm a freakin' Buddhist! A Buddhist!
Lisa,"Larry, please don't judge our whole family by Bart. He's the black sheep. Not that black sheep are in any way inferior to white sheep. I do not judge wool by its color -- only by how itchy it is. Ooh, look! Jazz!"
Lisa,"Larry, what sub-genre of jazz do you like? Fusion? Neo-bop?"
Lisa,Afro-Cuban?
Lisa,Larry!
Lisa,Gotcha!
Lisa,Larry? Larry? Larry? Larryyyy?!
Lisa,He's in here. Safe and sound. Let me just staple that bag for you.
Lisa,What do you care? You don't even like him.
Lisa,Um... what if someone were to lose Larry?
Lisa,Where'd you get this rope?
Lisa,"Bart, I'm losing my grip!"
Lisa,What will that do?
Lisa,"Chief, my brother fell in the storm drain!"
Lisa,Fine. What's their number?
Lisa,What about Bart?
Lisa,"So Grampa, you really saved Dad's life?"
Lisa,Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!
Lisa,"I agree it's cliché, but she does have a certain-- Unicorn!"
Lisa,Just give me this!
Lisa,Don't forget the unicorn!
Lisa,Princess Penelope! Sign mine! Sign mine!
Lisa,I AM HER / SHE IS ME / I'M JUST LIKE / PENELOPE...
Lisa,IT'S STILL ON / IN MY HEAD / IT WILL BE THERE TILL I'M DEAD...
Lisa,"Whether she's competing in equestrian events at the 1976 Olympics or spending her summers at Holyrood Palace, Princess Anne is truly a world leader."
Lisa,You guys will be the hit of cousin Valerie's wedding reception!
Lisa,Why is everyone staring at static?
Lisa,Maybe I should go out and get you guys a converter.
Lisa,Wow! How long has the TV been out?
Lisa,"All right, it's all hooked up."
Lisa,I've never seen Mr. Burns this happy.
Lisa,Just think what that game could do for Grampa and his friends!
Lisa,This isn't normal TV. It's a videogame that encourages activity and exercise!
Lisa,"Please, at least try the tennis game."
Lisa,You use the wand like a tennis racket to hit an invisible ball.
Lisa,Why is the TV back on? What happened to the videogame?
Lisa,Why would you put it in the dishwasher?
Lisa,You ruined it on purpose. You want the old folks to be zombies -- because it makes your jobs easier!
Lisa,"Well, I agree it's not the most pleasant job in the world, but..."
Lisa,"Well, you still should have let them have their fun!"
Lisa,Yeah. Or is it just a cover story for a grownup thing we're not allowed to know about?
Lisa,Excuse me? I think this fell off your hat.
Lisa,Thank you!
Lisa,Come on. They're just pins.
Lisa,But he does look lonely all by himself...
Lisa,"One Labatty, please."
Lisa,All Dad needs to do is put his stone inside that circle and they win.
Lisa,Oh my God! Dad threw too hard!
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,"Sorry, but I was planning to stop by the Olympic Pin Center to fill in a few small gaps in my collection. Y'know, just to get me through the day."
Lisa,Oh my gosh. It's the mascot from the 1924 games in Chamonix!
Lisa,I must have him!
Lisa,"Um... Can I have it on account? On account of I want it? You've heard that one, huh?"
Lisa,"My pearls? These were a gift from my Mom, when I could first read at a twelfth grade level."
Lisa,Just take 'em.
Lisa,I saw you grooving to the beat! You gotta pay for that!
Lisa,Nothing's going on. Just sharing my music with the good people of Vancouver.
Lisa,A dime? What do you think I am -- a pay phone from nineteen eighty?!
Lisa,"I'm fine! Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine..."
Lisa,There is no dress. It's just pins! Help me!
Lisa,"What is this, tough love?"
Lisa,"It's not that easy, Bart. I... traded away my pearls! Without them, I'm just a big Maggie!"
Lisa,"Ooh, family trees -- the charts representing genealogical relationships in a branching structure!"
Lisa,I can't wait to see what noble branches lie in the Simpson family foliage!
Lisa,"No, this can't be right."
Lisa,They're all horrible!
Lisa,"There must have been some good ancestors -- Grampa, don't you know any?"
Lisa,"I won't give up. I have to know that somewhere in the muck and the mire and the Pittsburgh Poisoners, this family had a noble spark. And I will find it, even if I have to go back to Adam and Eve."
Lisa,"Well, are you gonna help me or what?"
Lisa,Thank you.
Lisa,Family records for a school project on genealogical--
Lisa,...Dad's idea pad...
Lisa,Bicentennial issue of Reader's Digest...
Lisa,Old ad for Buzz Cola...
Lisa,So dusty.
Lisa,The Diary Of Eliza Simpson?
Lisa,"This entry's dated April 14th, 1860."
Lisa,"""Dearest Diary, today I am the happiest girl in Springfield--"""
Lisa,"""...because tomorrow, I shall get my very first slave."""
Lisa,I can't believe we're descended from slave owners!
Lisa,"""Saturday, April 14, 1860. Dear Diary, I must be brief, for tonight is the grand ball..."""
Lisa,That's all there is -- the rest of the diary has turned to dust!
Lisa,Yes!
Lisa,She wasn't a slave owner! Our family was on the Underground Railroad!
Lisa,"No, the ""Underground Railroad"" was a bunch of people who helped slaves escape to Canada. There were no actual trains, and it wasn't under ground."
Lisa,I never thought of that before.
Lisa,What are you doing? I wanna know what happens next.
Lisa,But-but-but-but-but...
Lisa,I must know!
Lisa,"Well I am reading it, and when I'm finished, I'm going to use Eliza's diary for my ""Black History Month"" presentation!"
Lisa,"Listen: ""April 20th, 1860. A week ago, I had no idea what the future would bring, which, I guess, is always true of everyone all the time. Anyway, last Saturday night, I went to Colonel Burns's ball..."""
Lisa,Run!
Lisa,I'll never know if Eliza got Virgil safely to freedom!
Lisa,To the reference desk!
Lisa,That's Eliza's mother!
Lisa,"Martha, you are the best."
Lisa,Please don't make those recipes.
Lisa,They made it back to the house?! How?!
Lisa,Wait. All that was in the recipe?
Lisa,So they did the right thing -- my quest is fulfilled! Our family has heroes!
Lisa,Our family has heroes!
Lisa,"My Black History Month presentation is called ""The Simpsons: The First Family of Freedom."""
Lisa,"No, no, no, not now! Quit! Quit! No, don't quit the program, just the update, ya stupid--"
Lisa,"Computers, right? Our story begins with a spunky little spitfire named Eliza Simpson."
Lisa,"The year was 1860, and the Underground Railroad was..."
Lisa,"...And though Hiram, Mabel, and Eliza are no longer among us, their truth goes marching on. Thank you."
Lisa,What are you talking about?
Lisa,No! You lie! Eliza Simpson can't be a coward! She's the only decent ancestor I have.
Lisa,But I need to prove that my ancestor couldn't have backed down to Colonel Burns!
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,There's no noble Simpson.
Lisa,"You were right, Dad. I should have quit while I was ahead, instead of learning the horrible truth about our family and Virgil."
Lisa,What are you talking about? Is there something you know about Virgil that you haven't told us?
Lisa,Yes! I'm thrilled! We've regained our family honor and we're one-sixty-fourth black!
Lisa,That's why my jazz is so smooth!
Lisa,"Grampa, why'd you try to keep us from finding this out?"
Lisa,Racists?
Lisa,Now what are you up to?
Lisa,Hi. Now what are you up to?
Lisa,Just close your eyes and think of Milhouse.
Lisa,How did you--
Lisa,"Well, sometimes people who agree on most things have one issue that they disagree strongly about. In politics it's called a ""wedge issue"" -- like illegal immigration or gay marriage."
Lisa,You would mess up Mom and Dad's marriage just to get out of doing some homework?
Lisa,"Fractions aren't that hard, you just have to find a common denominator. For example: one half plus one third equals..."
Lisa,You'll need to know fractions to make that explosion!
Lisa,Congratulations. You're officially a sociopath.
Lisa,"Thanks, Dad. But you're so loud it's hurting my ears."
Lisa,"Life stinks, huh?"
Lisa,Mom said she was tipped off by a note from me. But you know something? I didn't write this note.
Lisa,You wanted to get caught.
Lisa,"Elementary, my dear Simpson."
Lisa,"Leave it to you to misspell a word you see first thing every morning. But don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. As far as Mom and Dad know, you're just a soulless little psycho."
Lisa,Anytime.
Lisa,"Dad, a meter is three inches longer than a yard, which is thirty-six inches, so fifty divided by thirty-nine times thirty-six, equals--"
Lisa,"An F?! Okay, this is the time when I always wake up."
Lisa,"Come on, alarm clock -- get me out of this!"
Lisa,"No it's not, dream-Hoover! And as long as I'm asleep, I'm gonna have some fun. I can fly! Wheeee!"
Lisa,This isn't a dream. I really did fail.
Lisa,An F. An F! I hope Harvard never finds out about this.
Lisa,"Uh-oh, looks like I'm in more trouble. Born to be bad."
Lisa,I'm just advanced! You can catch up!
Lisa,"""Dear fellow organic gardening enthusiasts: I'm afraid I am too sad to post my list of garden-friendly snails. Yet again I have seen the bitter truth of how difficult it is to be smart and accepted."" ""With mulch love, Lisa Simpson."" Mulch love, that's cute."
Lisa,Somebody posted a comment?
Lisa,"""Don't stop achieving just yet, Lisa. You are not alone -- Flotus-one."" ""Flotus-one?"" Who could that be?"
Lisa,"Flotus1 is ""First Lady Of The United States... one!"""
Lisa,And now you're the most elegant and popular woman in the world!
Lisa,Schnell! Schnell!
Lisa,Mr. Flanders invited us to Israel. I think he wants to get Dad into Heaven.
Lisa,The man hates pants.
Lisa,"Krusty, I've been meaning to ask, what are you doing on this tour?"
Lisa,"Yes, it is fitting."
Lisa,Jews don't believe in Hell.
Lisa,"Dad, are you okay?"
Lisa,"Ah yes, ""Jerusalem Syndrome."" The name given to religious delusions or psychoses that occur when people visit Jerusalem."
Lisa,"Hmm... Dad said he was going to ""unite all faiths."" And only one site is sacred to Muslims, Christians and Jews -- The Dome of the Rock!"
Lisa,Krav maga!
Lisa,"No, the ants are the farmers."
Lisa,"Nothing! Look, do you want to do it or not?"
Lisa,Fine.
Lisa,Such an intricate formicarium! I'm the proudest myrmecologist on the block.
Lisa,"Hey, they're not eating."
Lisa,Bart! That Pop Tart wasn't locally farmed or sourced!
Lisa,"Well, I'm so glad I'm not your mom."
Lisa,Ew! Ew! Ew! I'll never get that image out of my head!
Lisa,If they're anybody's children they're mine!
Lisa,"Quick, we've got to get them back!"
Lisa,There's only one ant left!
Lisa,"Well, I will never forgive you, Bart."
Lisa,That only angers me more.
Lisa,You're not going anywhere near Annie.
Lisa,"As in ""Little Orphan."""
Lisa,"Bart, she's only carrying thirty times her weight. Our girl is slowing down."
Lisa,"It's the natural order of things. I'm afraid she's got another two, maybe three days, tops."
Lisa,"Ants have six legs, Bart."
Lisa,"You're just a tiny ant, but you were strong enough to pull my brother and me together. Now go and be free."
Lisa,/ What's going on?
Lisa,"Dad, while I agree reducing consumption is great, it's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle."
Lisa,"No... I am suggesting you consider cheaper, alternate sources of energy."
Lisa,Dad! I found what you're looking for!
Lisa,"Dad, you are leading the way in clean energy."
Lisa,"Dad, all it means is we're providing power to the electric company."
Lisa,"Dad, if we're really off the grid, then we won't get power when the air is still."
Lisa,"But Dad, it defeats the purpose if you're powering our windmill with the electricity from Flanders."
Lisa,"Bart, please! I'm trying to hear Dr. House's third incorrect diagnosis before his final correct diagnosis!"
Lisa,We're gonna go check out the wind damage!
Lisa,Oh my God...
Lisa,A beached whale.
Lisa,"Bart, can you believe that something so mighty has been rendered so powerless?"
Lisa,"She's such a beautiful shade of blue... I'm going to call you Bluella the Whale."""
Lisa,"C'mon, everybody! A whale needs help!"
Lisa,Whales are mammals like us! They're sensitive and deeply intelligent!
Lisa,I'm gonna get real help. Just try to keep her wet.
Lisa,"Hey, Mom... Dad... there's a whale on the beach... You've gotta help me get her back in the ocean!"
Lisa,"Hurry, Dad, hurry!"
Lisa,But I don't know how to drive.
Lisa,A little.
Lisa,It's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart.
Lisa,I'll catch up with you guys in a little bit.
Lisa,"You know, when I'm sad, I read something beautiful and true: poetry."
Lisa,"No, no, you'll like it. It's about the ocean."
Lisa,"""The world below the brine / Forests at the bottom of the sea / the Branches and leaves... / Sea-lettuce, vast lichens..."
Lisa,"Girl, you're going home! You're going home!"
Lisa,"Goodbye, Bluella! Send me a post card from Tierra Del Fuego!"
Lisa,Bye! Goodbye!
Lisa,Bluella?
Lisa,Oh no.
Lisa,She doesn't like lying on the beach! She likes being in the ocean!
Lisa,Maybe I should just be alone a little bit.
Lisa,Bluella?
Lisa,No. I'm not gonna be disappointed again.
Lisa,Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Lisa,"They must be Bluella's children! Hello, whale calves! Your mother lives on through you!"
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,"Run! I mean, swim! I mean ."
Lisa,"Those baby whales are doomed, just like their mom. I guess it's just nature's way."
Lisa,Dad? Where did you get that boat?
Lisa,"Dad, no!"
Lisa,"They're right. If the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature, I can't let you do it."
Lisa,Dad! The sharks must think you're a baby whale!
Lisa,It's the baby whales' dad!
Lisa,"Thanks for not letting me give up, Dad."
Lisa,Do you think they'll be okay?
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,"That's not true! First of all, Milhouse fell because you tripped him. Secondly, ""spaz"" is short for ""spastic diplegic,"" someone who suffers from a serious medical condition. Thirdly, your ""haw haw,"" through overuse, has lost its power."
Lisa,"Well, I am one: flattered and two: intrigued. Lisa Simpson."
Lisa,I didn't know we had a debate team.
Lisa,...and that is why hybrid car buyers should be given rebates paid for by taxes on hamburgers.
Lisa,"Initially yes, but--"
Lisa,"Currently. However, solar and wind are..."
Lisa,Blondie?
Lisa,"First of all, my father no longer has any functioning credit cards. Secondly, how dare you refer--"
Lisa,I... I...
Lisa,Excuse me! Is this what the framers of the constitution would want?
Lisa,How many personal freedoms are we willing to give up in the name of security?
Lisa,Again with the blonde! Why in the world would the color of the hair on someone's head have anything to do with the intelligence within?
Lisa,I ha--
Lisa,Sally Circle was eating donuts and Ovaltine when her father came in with terrible news.
Lisa,Everyone was mean to Sally. She was too well-rounded. She felt cornered. They wouldn't let her play four-square or invite her to the box social.
Lisa,The end.
Lisa,That's a rather unambitious book.
Lisa,You're blond too.
Lisa,Dye! Dye! DYE!
Lisa,"Dressing in uniforms is a good thing -- if everyone looks the same, it levels the playing field."
Lisa,It's better to just fit in with the crowd.
Lisa,"Oh, I can't go on! This rebuttal is a sham!"
Lisa,You aren't being persuaded by the content of my argument -- you're being convinced by the color of my hair!
Lisa,"Well guess what, I am not a brunette! I'm a blonde!"
Lisa,We must rid ourselves of these outdated clichés. Not all blondes are dumb! Not all fat people are jolly.
Lisa,And not all old people are bad drivers!
Lisa,Dad! That's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife.
Lisa,"When there's cruelty involved, Bart sure knows his history."
Lisa,"Dad, I'm gonna need some help getting this off."
Lisa,Grandma?!
Lisa,How shortened?
Lisa,Another Springfield family moves to Detroit to find a better life.
Lisa,What's that delicious smell?
Lisa,"Mom, it's so superficial to judge our new neighbor based on his furniture. He drives a hybrid!"
Lisa,He's got koi!
Lisa,I know where Bob's taking Bart!
Lisa,"Oh, Bart. I am so glad everything's okay."
Lisa,"Mr. Flanders, how did you make these amazing fish?"
Lisa,"So that ""natural selection"" was the origin of this species?"
Lisa,"Mr. Szyslak, would you like to buy some band candy?"
Lisa,That doesn't work on me.
Lisa,I can see that down deep is a decent man.
Lisa,"As an eight-year-old girl in twenty-first century America, I know how it is to feel insecure about your looks. But you've got so much going for you. I'd kill for your sense of smell... you have a nice firm handshake..."
Lisa,"And when you wag your tail, it really lights up a room."
Lisa,"Now, let's scoot together."
Lisa,"Mr. Cowell, would you like some band candy?"
Lisa,"We're watching the Nobel Prize announcements, live from Stockholm!"
Lisa,Quiet! It's time for the noblest Nobel Prize of all: the Peace Prize.
Lisa,Isn't this exciting?
Lisa,"Why aren't I going to Oslo? The Nobel Prizes are my freakin' thing! But no -- Bart gets everything because he's the oldest and he's a boy. And Maggie gets what's ever left over because she's the youngest and she's a baby. Meanwhile, I'll just stand and wave to people going to better places."
Lisa,"Ew, no thanks."
Lisa,"I'm just gonna chill out with a little ""This American Life."""
Lisa,"Mom, this isn't the way home."
Lisa,"Oh I get it. They go to Oslo, we get some ice cream."
Lisa,Oh my God! Mom! Thank you! I just need my...
Lisa,Victory for the middle child!
Lisa,Hello? Hello?
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,ARTS ARTS ARTS EDUCATION...
Lisa,I can hear you.
Lisa,Do you guys always do that?
Lisa,"Sing what you just said, then play a little guitar riff."
Lisa,I NEVER KNEW ARTISTS WERE ALL SO AMAZING!
Lisa,DO YOU THINK THAT I COULD BE AN ARTIST IN THE CITY?
Lisa,I finally found the place I belong.
Lisa,It can't be Saturday already! Monday was orientation. Tuesday we did mime.
Lisa,"Wednesday we did ""Mame."""
Lisa,Thursday we got attacked by bees.
Lisa,Friday morning Andrew Lloyd Weber and Elaine Stritch helped us make wallets.
Lisa,"Friday evening we performed ""Angels In America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes."" Part one: Millennium Approaches..."
Lisa,Part two...
Lisa,"That's right! Strike the set, pizza party..."
Lisa,"Saturday morning, and then... noooo!"
Lisa,I can't go home. Something happened this week that completely changed me!
Lisa,"No! I fell in love with theater, dance, and song!"
Lisa,"Well, the combination of me leaving arts camp and you driving on and off the shoulder has made me a little ill."
Lisa,"Okay, maybe it won't be that bad."
Lisa,Arts camp was lovely.
Lisa,But arts camp encouraged us to spread our wings and fly.
Lisa,How do you cope?
Lisa,It's just... dinner conversation at arts camp was a bit more stimulating. One night we spoke only in lines from famous poems.
Lisa,Emily Dickinson.
Lisa,"If you need me, I'll be upstairs saying goodbye to my dreams."
Lisa,"Maggie, your big sister is leaving for a more artistic life. I'll send for you when I'm famous. We'll take the town by storm like the Brontë sisters."
Lisa,"Oh Maggie, don't ever turn two."
Lisa,I came to share in the esteem that the world bestows on its artists.
Lisa,Sure is cold in here.
Lisa,Tomatoes? What kind of artists are you?
Lisa,Are you saying arts camp was a lie?
Lisa,"WHAT I DON'T GET IS, WHY ALL THE LIES?"
Lisa,"It's called ""applause."""
Lisa,Mom! Take me home!
Lisa,"Goodbye, guys. I'll try again when I'm older..."
Lisa,"Thanks, guys!"
Lisa,I NEVER KNEW ARTISTS WERE ALL SO AMAZING!
Lisa,DO YOU THINK THAT I COULD BE AN ARTIST IN THE CITY?
Lisa,"Are you sure about that, Grampa?"
Lisa,So I want to honor Grampa by giving my inheritance to charity. But which one?
Lisa,"Ooh, what's this?"
Lisa,Got it!
Lisa,"Let's see, I could help someone in any impoverished area on earth. Bangladesh... Bolivia... East Springfield?!"
Lisa,Nelson?!
Lisa,"I will. I'll take a chance on you, Nelson Muntz."
Lisa,"So Nelson, I see you started a small business."
Lisa,"Well, whoever your mysterious donor is, he, or she, really wants you to succeed."
Lisa,"Ooh, your first customer. Be nice!"
Lisa,"Ooh, a message from my small business person!"
Lisa,"Hi, Nelson."
Lisa,"No, but there is something I can't hold back any more. I'm your microfinance donor!"
Lisa,"Well, I didn't do this for thanks, but if you want to thank me, I can stand here and listen for as long as it takes."
Lisa,You're quitting school?!
Lisa,But don't you know that people who don't go to college make three percent less than people who do?
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, I need to convince Nelson to come back to school."
Lisa,He is. He's paying people eleven dollars an hour to work for him.
Lisa,Isn't that a Christmas tie?
Lisa,"Oh, I don't know. I thought one of these super-successful people might tell you how important it is to stay in school. Why look, it's Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook!"
Lisa,"Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm Lisa, and this is Nelson."
Lisa,"That's great, Mr. Zuckerberg, but I was hoping you could tell us how education was instrumental to your success."
Lisa,You did?
Lisa,"Well, clearly, you're an exception."
Lisa,Didn't anybody here stay in school?
Lisa,"There, you see?"
Lisa,I used Grampa's money to try to help someone in need. But it didn't go the way I expected.
Lisa,"Nelson, I just wanted to say that I realize now you can't be anyone else other than who you are, and..."
Lisa,"Hi, Nelson."
Lisa,"This is really fun. But we're still just friends, right?"
Lisa,Can I hold your hand... for balance?
Lisa,Sorry.
Lisa,Sorry.
Lisa,Sorry!
Lisa,There's a car in the parking lot with a Yale sticker on it! It's gotta be you.
Lisa,I plan to attend an Ivy League school myself. I do have a 4.0 GPA.
Lisa,"Well, that depends."
Lisa,"Um, I'm treasurer of the Jazz Club, and started the school's recycling society."
Lisa,"Uh, that's it."
Lisa,But I'm only in second grade.
Lisa,Thrust! Parry! Dodge! Poke!
Lisa,"C'mon, Maggie. I need to get good at fencing so I can put it on my resume and get into Yale. Don't be scared. I won't hurt my widdle sister."
Lisa,Anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything!
Lisa,It's me!
Lisa,"What, you can't stand the idea of a girl coaching a boys' baseball team?"
Lisa,"Hey, there have been plenty of female managers in baseball! Connie Mack, Sandy Alomar, Terry Francona, Pinky Higgins--"
Lisa,"Really?... They sound like... I mean... well, the thing..."
Lisa,"Okay, bottom line: I need an extra-curricular activity, and no one else will coach you loveable losers."
Lisa,"Look, if you want to play liability-insured baseball, I'm your only shot."
Lisa,Thanks. You can be the free safety.
Lisa,I mean the point guard.
Lisa,I'm gonna do a little research.
Lisa,Don't call me honey pie.
Lisa,We're brother and sister.
Lisa,"Hey, Dad."
Lisa,Fine. I was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy.
Lisa,Does anyone here actually know anything about baseball?
Lisa,"Wow, I'm surprised you guys know so much about a sport."
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,"Thanks, guys."
Lisa,Everyone shift towards right!
Lisa,"Okay, everyone study two-out situations, count management, and I'll be back with some gluten-free crackers."
Lisa,"Bart, this guy's walked the last two batters, and if he walks you, we win the game. Don't swing at anything!"
Lisa,Hot streaks are a statistical illusion.
Lisa,"Well, there's a ninety-seven percent chance I'm not, so do what I say."
Lisa,Don't swing.
Lisa,You disobeyed your manager!
Lisa,"Here's what: you're off the team! Get him outta here, boys."
Lisa,"C'mon, guys. I had to get rid of Bart."
Lisa,That dinger was a fluke! Not that I have to defend myself to you. Managers manage and players play.
Lisa,I don't know... yes.
Lisa,"...So because of your on-base percentage, Nelson, you're the new leadoff hitter. Questions?"
Lisa,He's not! He thought he was better than the laws of probability. Anyone else think he's better than the laws of probability?
Lisa,"Well, you're not!"
Lisa,"Look, Dad! ""Players and Coaches' Entrance!"""
Lisa,I need you! Ralph can't play 'cause he's too juiced.
Lisa,What am I gonna do? I need a pinch-runner with speed!
Lisa,Bart!
Lisa,Now get out there a kick a field goal! Kidding!
Lisa,"No! No, don't steal!"
Lisa,"Okay, okay, he's stolen third. But surely that's the limit of his cockiness..."
Lisa,No! The computer says it's statistically impossible!
Lisa,"Stealing home. It's so impossible. It's against every sensible instinct... it's, it's..."
Lisa,"It's the most exciting play in baseball! Go, Bart!"
Lisa,"No. But you did do something. You made me love baseball. Not as a collection of numbers, but as an unpredictable, passionate game beaten in excitement only by every other sport."
Lisa,"Maybe it was, but according to my calculations, you're a great brother fifty-one percent of the time."
Lisa,Can you put a number on it?
Lisa,Awww...
Lisa,"Well, my Latin's a little rusty, but I think to get everything back in its box, you have to finish the game."
Lisa,You're gonna have to deal with more nonsense like that.
Lisa,It's something you've never seen: they're smitten.
Lisa,"Well, he is cute. But I'm sure a boy like him would never say hello to me."
Lisa,I love your pallor.
Lisa,How'd you do that?
Lisa,They're just dots in circles.
Lisa,"You're a vampire! I should be scared, but I'm not."
Lisa,"Edmund's almost here, so PLEASE nobody be themselves!"
Lisa,I know just how you feel!
Lisa,"Bite me now, Edmund -- and we'll both be vampires!"
Lisa,"Sir, I'm not trying to take your son away from you. I plan to be a part of your rich culture, and organize media-friendly events to help combat all the unfair vampire stereotypes."
Lisa,"Eight forever? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I can't spend eternity using kid scissors. They barely cut anything!"
Lisa,"Uh, Dad? They turned you into a vampire."
Lisa,"Dad, I think Maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing ""Baby Must-Have."""
Lisa,Didn't there used to be more Texxon stations?
Lisa,"Someday when I'm a grownup, maybe I'll go back and look fondly at our house."
Lisa,"Wow, Mom -- you got first place in the science fair!"
Lisa,"Mom, these grades are amazing! Just as good as mine!"
Lisa,Principal Skinner? Quick question. Is it true my Mom was a great student?
Lisa,Well... of course that would be great. But I see myself making an impact... outside the home.
Lisa,"Maggie, something happened to Mom and I'm gonna find out what and when."
Lisa,"Mom's looking good through elementary school... ninth grade, tenth grade, still ridin' the A-Train... Then suddenly, when she was a high school senior BLAM!"
Lisa,What could've happened?
Lisa,"Dad, can I talk to you for a second?"
Lisa,"Well, um, I was looking through Mom's old schoolwork, and I noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you."
Lisa,"No offense Dad, but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams."
Lisa,No! That's not gonna happen to me! I'm gonna make sure nothing distracts me ever!
Lisa,"Okay, I've gotten rid of all of my distractions, diversions, hobbies and... Oh my God!"
Lisa,"Are you a distraction, or a higher calling? All right, let's see. How many jazz musicians led long and happy lives? There's, um..."
Lisa,"Mom, could you keep it down a little? I'm trying to study."
Lisa,"Mom, is something wrong?"
Lisa,"Mom, I admire everything you do--"
Lisa,It's plenty good! It's great! It's just... not for me.
Lisa,What kind of kiss did you get?
Lisa,Ice cold.
Lisa,Oh yeah?
Lisa,The seven of clubs.
Lisa,"What's the point of getting rid of all the distractions at home, if I have to do my learning here?"
Lisa,Willie!
Lisa,Do you have to wax this floor now?
Lisa,Should I get the nurse?
Lisa,Dad was right -- I might as well give up.
Lisa,Cloisters Academy?! That bus could pick me up any day of the week!
Lisa,"Lord Buddha, I know I'm not supposed to want stuff, but c'mon."
Lisa,"Mom, Dad! Please, can I go here? I'll study so hard I'll make the old me look like Bart."
Lisa,"Mom, please don't."
Lisa,"I have a future! Thank you, Mom!"
Lisa,I'm so exci--
Lisa,An academy! I'm attending an academy!
Lisa,"I'm sorry, I don't really play."
Lisa,Count me in!
Lisa,"Well, I am so happy to be in your class."
Lisa,Did you get that the pony was actually me?
Lisa,Self-published?
Lisa,"That school is so great! Teachers teach so much better when they're paid in money, and not in chickens. Is Mom gonna come up and say goodnight?"
Lisa,Mom?
Lisa,Mom?
Lisa,I see what happened. There was no scholarship. They said I could attend if you did all their laundry. I can't live with that knowledge while trying to get more knowledge.
Lisa,Mom... I don't want to go to that school.
Lisa,"Because, it's too elitist. Everyone's parents are in ""the business."""
Lisa,"I don't know! They won't tell me! And besides... you were willing to do all this just so I would be happy! Mom, I'd be honored if I turned out like you."
Lisa,Mr. Burns? Where's he going?
Lisa,Now they're dancing on his grave!
Lisa,"Hm, apparently Mr. Burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent."
Lisa,"People of Springfield, to quote Shakespeare, ""the quality of mercy is not strained..."""
Lisa,"You know, it takes a lot for an eight-year-old to stand up in front of the whole town."
Lisa,"We're called ""little people"" and I'm not one."
Lisa,"People of Springfield, as a nerd, I understand your desire for revenge, but this sweet, harmless man is not the same remorseless monster who tormented us all."
Lisa,What did you do with him?
Lisa,"Dad, Mr. Burns is here for you again."
Lisa,"A little tired of revenge, are we?"
Lisa,"All right. Mr. Burns, I'm gonna show you that not all of us in this town are vindictive and cruel."
Lisa,Not today.
Lisa,"I thought after all you went through, you just might want to spend an hour in a place where you felt at home."
Lisa,"Actually, sir, the man who lived here didn't have many friends. But you're a better person than he ever was."
Lisa,"Yes, technically it's you. But like I said, people change and--"
Lisa,"Hey, there's a number on him. What is it?"
Lisa,Thank God your son can't see the way you're behaving.
Lisa,You said it was Boston.
Lisa,Like those chairs in the music room?
Lisa,Huh. It's a pigeon.
Lisa,The poor guy hurt his wing.
Lisa,"Or, more likely, the phone number of the bird's owner."
Lisa,"Yes, I believe I have your pigeon, ""Raymond Bird,"" and I need to know how to return him to you."
Lisa,"Yes, he could fly home, except that he has a broken wing. Perhaps you and your sarcasm could come to Springfield and retrieve him."
Lisa,"Looks like you're gonna have to take care of him, Bart."
Lisa,"No, no... Listen, don't tell anyone, but... I can't stand pigeons! They're like rats with wings!"
Lisa,"Oh... Okay, maybe he's not so bad."
Lisa,No! No! No! Get off! Get off! Get off!
Lisa,"Mom, it's just Maggie."
Lisa,"Mom, why am I so repulsed by pigeons? It doesn't make any sense."
Lisa,"I'm a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Amoebas, The League of Women Vultures, the N-double-A-C-Porcupines, Kids for Squids, the A.C.L. Unicorns, Clamnesty International and, uh... well, those are the best ones."
Lisa,Really?
Lisa,I'll tell you later.
Lisa,It's amazing how I can feel sorry for you and hate you at the same time. I'm sure there's a German word for it.
Lisa,You're gonna put him down?
Lisa,This is where we're ditching the dog?
Lisa,Not really.
Lisa,You do for me.
Lisa,"Marking a crime scene. To celebrate a ancient pagan ritual, this tree was cut down and tarted up like a dime-a-dance floozy."
Lisa,You mean your gingerbread McMansion.
Lisa,So you're the brown nosed reindeer that's jingled all the way to the top.
Lisa,"Oh, I know what you're after. The toy you never got."
Lisa,"Oh really? Well let me ask you this, how many kids bring a gun to meet Santa?"
Lisa,Security!
Lisa,Why can't they leave a poor tree in the woods where it belongs?
Lisa,Can it really be Christmas when one of our parents is facing the German army?
Lisa,Don't dare bring that thing in here!
Lisa,Don't worry about that. I love meat and I always will.
Lisa,"Mmm-mm, that is some sweet pig meat. But as for Christmas trees... I used to love them -- until last year, when I went tree shopping with Mom..."
Lisa,"So I never want to see another Christmas tree... until Mom comes back, safe and sound."
Lisa,"See? Every time we get a tree, Mom disappears!"
Lisa,... ... ...
Lisa,Oh no! This is where they took Mom from me!
Lisa,It's a sign. Mom's okay! Thank you.
Lisa,"Yes, but then I learned that there's always hope. Someday this war will be over. Someday our Mom will be back."
Lisa,"But until then this tree will stand for everything Mom believes in: home, family and constantly sweeping up needles."
Lisa,"O TANNENBAUM, O TANNENBAUM..."
Lisa,"DU GRUNST NICHT NUR ZUR SOMMERZEIT, /"
Lisa,"NEIN AUCH IM WINTER, WENN ES SCHNEIT..."
Lisa,This is the last time I bring these two to bed at the same time.
Lisa,"Ms. Stewart, I made a star for the tree out of discarded water bottles!"
Lisa,I'll go outside and make snow angels.
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,"Merry Christmas, Mom!"
Lisa,IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE BREAKFAST...
Lisa,...EVERYWHERE YOU GO
Lisa,Did you get a good house-sitter?
Lisa,"Aw, poor baby."
Lisa,"Come on, Bart. Afraid of a little apple juice?"
Lisa,Dad's underwear!
Lisa,Happy New Year!
Lisa,Why are you hung over? I didn't see you drink last night.
Lisa,"Your four eyes saw a lot today, Milhouse. What's the skinny?"
Lisa,Bart?
Lisa,We've got to stop Mom from going out with those women.
Lisa,Could we hurry this up? I am really uncomfortable being a girl in this store.
Lisa,"Hey, does Dad know you and the cool moms broke up?"
Lisa,"Sorry you broke up with your friends, Mom."
Lisa,"Come on, pretend he meant something to you."
Lisa,I'm busy.
Lisa,Fine. Just get in here.
Lisa,You could deliver newspapers.
Lisa,"Maybe if you buckle down and get good grades, dad will give you money."
Lisa,I've been doing the family's books for years. I take what I need.
Lisa,"Something wrong, Bart?"
Lisa,"I love it. I know I use the word ""empowering"" a lot, but this time it really is that."
Lisa,"Oh my God, me too!"
Lisa,I can't take it. I'm just going to draw a hairline on.
Lisa,Help! My macaroni Marconi!
Lisa,Huh. Let's see what cousin Jessica's up to.
Lisa,"You can't listen to those women, Mom. Change threatens them. They didn't like it when the Springfield Shopper started printing in color."
Lisa,"Mom, your choice to go back to blue is so empowering."
Lisa,"Well, as a feminist, virtually anything a woman does is empowering."
Lisa,No. It's oddly dehumanizing.
Lisa,The most comfortable ergonomic chair there is.
Lisa,"'Angry Dad: The Movie.' Angry Dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs."""
Lisa,Angry Dad slips and crashes down the stairs.
Lisa,"No Dad, don't say ""pained noises,"" you make pained noises."
Lisa,"You know, your movie's not all bad. If you cut out the stuff that didn't work, it would make a great short film."
Lisa,"Many great directors, like Wes Anderson, Frank Tashlin, and Tim Burton started with short films."
Lisa,Taylor Hackford.
Lisa,"The creative team from Mixar! Pardon me. I've seen all of your movies except ""Cars,"" and I can't believe my brother is in the same category as the digital Rembrandts of my generation!"
Lisa,I believe it's from Lamps Plus.
Lisa,"Good luck, Mr. Park. There'd be no shame in losing to you."
Lisa,"""While beautiful, the desert also harbors hidden dangers: cacti, poisonous snakes, and most deadly of all--"
Lisa,"Scorpions!"""
Lisa,They calm down when they're near the Springfield Silvertongues!
Lisa,"Now they're aggressive again! I'm sure there's a correlation, but could there be a... causation?"
Lisa,"These flowers saved me from a terrible fate -- not getting an ""A"" on my next science project!"
Lisa,"That doesn't seem fair -- they won't let him escape, then they kick him out. I wonder where he'll go."
Lisa,This calls for some Springfield Silvertongue!
Lisa,"Dad, look! This essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile!"
Lisa,That's him!
Lisa,"Dad, is there anything unusual in Grampa's coffee?"
Lisa,Dad! I know what you did!
Lisa,And I locked the back door!
Lisa,...and that's why you're acting so sweet and kind. Because Dad drugged you!
Lisa,But it's not real happiness. It's just because of an untested drug!
Lisa,It was wrong of me to play goddess!
Lisa,"All right, Bart. What are you up to now?"
Lisa,"It's okay, Grampa -- you don't have to act grumpy. I know you're taking the drug, and I don't mind -- because you're happy."
Lisa,"Thanks, sweetie."
Lisa,I'm sorry I was so stubborn. I hope you're not mad.
Lisa,"Oh, I ain't mad, and I never will be again -- thanks to your wonderful, wonderful..."
Lisa,"Let me finish: thanks to your wonderful, wonderful drug."
Lisa,It happened to the scorpions too! The flower essence must have the side effect of lubricating the eye sockets to the point of popping.
Lisa,Look!
Lisa,So I guess the lesson here is...
Lisa,Cheech and Chong are from Springfield?
Lisa,These are comedy albums?
Lisa,The Noisy Minority... The Upside-Down Bubblegum Collective... The Regional Lampoon... The Plymouth Grok Experiment... Fro And Flo... Allan Sherman's Helter Shmelter...
Lisa,Is it really okay to just drop them into the pit where the Blockbuster used to be?
Lisa,"Easter grass, Cable Ace Awards, aquariums full of broken pinball game parts, popped but uneaten Jiffy Pop still in the silver bubble, sample-sized shampoos, detergents and whiskeys..."
Lisa,This is so sad. Can we help her?
Lisa,"You mean, just reality."
Lisa,"So, how was your first day of school?"
Lisa,"Grampa, you're not dead."
Lisa,"I never thought I'd say this, but Dad is the only one who can help us."
Lisa,"Wow! I know I lay down in front of bulldozers to stop this stadium from being built, but I have to admit, it's pretty sweet."
Lisa,You're out of tonic.
Lisa,Really? Can I see it?
Lisa,"Aw, come on, Bart, it's fun!"
Lisa,That was kind of the same as the first time.
Lisa,Why did I suggest this?
Lisa,"Ooh, authentic American folk music, just like they play on N.P.R.!"
Lisa,Initiate phase two.
Lisa,Affirmative.
Lisa,Roger.
Lisa,Where am I? This neighborhood is starting to look a little bit like... Sesame Street.
Lisa,Wonder who's in there. Could it be Oscar the...
Lisa,Help! I'm trapped in an alternate dimension! An existential netherspace!
Lisa,"I've been-- Hey, how ya doin'?"
Lisa,No one sent me. I just knocked on the door and it opened!
Lisa,"Uh, how'd I get from inside there to over here?"
Lisa,Sounds like most of the house is still owned by the bank.
Lisa,How did you do all that?
Lisa,"I do, I do!"
Lisa,Looks like there was magic between you two.
Lisa,Would you... be interested in teaching me?
Lisa,What if you just taught me one trick?
Lisa,I'm not exactly flattered by that.
Lisa,Hm.
Lisa,And George Washington took a trip down the...ear-y Canal!
Lisa,From the Great Raymondo.
Lisa,You never even opened it.
Lisa,Need some help?
Lisa,"Raymondo! I mastered the slide pass -- and I've almost mastered the Denver slide pass... and, why is there always a ""Denver"" version of things?"
Lisa,"Oh, what's wrong?"
Lisa,Ew.
Lisa,No!
Lisa,Raymondo's greatest secret!
Lisa,"No, I shouldn't -- I won't."
Lisa,You are? Why?
Lisa,"Students, teachers, detentionees...prepare to have everything you believe about milk cans challenged!"
Lisa,"Willie, if you will?"
Lisa,"I believe the expression is ""ta-da!"""
Lisa,My friends call me Lisa.
Lisa,"Shut up! Now, where were we?"
Lisa,"Oh, it's a lot less dangerous than you think. You can see me do it again in a talent show next week."
Lisa,There's no chance whatsoever. I'll show you.
Lisa,You don't open the top -- the locks are real.
Lisa,"The can is in two halves, and they slide apart."
Lisa,"From inside, you just push up. Easy peasy. And there's no way anyone can figure out how it's done."
Lisa,"Raymondo, I am so sorry. I got rolled by a pro! Do you know what it's like to be the kind of girl that boys never talk to and then suddenly a boy talks to you--"
Lisa,Haven't you ever been fooled by a pretty face?
Lisa,"Oh, you think I'm pretty?"
Lisa,Raymondo! You forgive me!
Lisa,I'll get him out!
Lisa,You're just gonna stand there?
Lisa,He's going to die!
Lisa,"I guess it's up to me to save you, Cregg Demon Magic Freek."
Lisa,Ricky Jay? David Copperfield? Penn? Teller?!?!
Lisa,But why?
Lisa,"Wait, I know he's an unethical magician, and his tattoos are a inconsistent mix of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms. But he doesn't deserve to die."
Lisa,"Raymondo, I knew your heart was as pure as the ether that helps you get to sleep. Raymondo?"
Lisa,"We used our last day of summer vacation standing in this line, and now it's time for our reward."
Lisa,"Sold, to the lowest bidder!"
Lisa,"Dad, Aunt Selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer."
Lisa,My lick.
Lisa,My lick.
Lisa,Brother germs!
Lisa,"Bart, this is a truffle."
Lisa,A truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots. It's one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world.
Lisa,"Bart, you can find them by smell! That's amazing! Restaurateurs use highly-trained pigs to sniff these out."
Lisa,Interested in these?
Lisa,How many truffles did you get?
Lisa,Brown gold... Tuscan tea...
Lisa,"Bart, I am putting this money safely in the bank where you will earn zero point zero zero one percent interest."
Lisa,Three more big ones and we'll talk.
Lisa,As big as a baby's head.
Lisa,That baby's head.
Lisa,We haven't even gotten our salads yet.
Lisa,"I'm sorry, Bart! Take the last truffle... do whatever you want. Sell it, eat it..."
Lisa,"Bart, you've done a truly kind thing."
Lisa,"Oh, so that's why they don't give pigs truffles."
Lisa,"Bart, this isn't a photograph. I'm not just gonna paint you into--"
Lisa,You just ruined six months' work!
Lisa,You're gonna regret the day you were born!
Lisa,"Bart, I'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser."
Lisa,Why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
Lisa,Cool! / Awesome!
Lisa,"Okay. First of all, it's never wise to use the word ""spew"" in a love song."
Lisa,"I'm sorry, but I don't love you, Milhouse, and I never will."
Lisa,"Oh. Usually, Milhouse does it."
Lisa,Why would a popular fifth-grader like Taffy be interested in a Milhouse like Milhouse?
Lisa,"Well, I'm gonna find out why, because this..."
Lisa,Hmm...
Lisa,Shut up! I just want to know what she's up to with Milhouse. A girl like her could get a fifth grader -- maybe even Kyle LoBianco!
Lisa,That's the first thing everyone knows about Kyle LoBianco!
Lisa,Taffy's up to something. And I won't find out what it is sitting at a computer. It's time to get boots on the ground.
Lisa,You like my boots?
Lisa,Who'd follow Milhouse around like that? Sneaking around after them all day has taught me a lot about this sicko.
Lisa,I am never gonna get my homework done tonight.
Lisa,"All right, sister. What's your game?"
Lisa,I am so sorry.
Lisa,"Milhouse, I... I..."
Lisa,Yes... no... I don't know! It means that... that life is full of unexpected things and you should never give up. And you're cute in the moonlight.
Lisa,"Dad, our lives!"
Lisa,Maggie's locked in!
Lisa,What's this key with the plastic skull for?
Lisa,So how come we have all these other keys?
Lisa,I'll return this to the school.
Lisa,Returning this lost key to Principal Skinner.
Lisa,"Well, maybe a little. But I'd never break the rules."
Lisa,Banned books?!
Lisa,Band books?!
Lisa,Could this key open...
Lisa,Get thee behind me Namuche! That's the Buddhist Satan. Let's give it a shot.
Lisa,"No problem, just some cobwebs."
Lisa,"I've discovered a mystery, wrapped in a riddle in the basement of a lousy school!"
Lisa,"It's like five classrooms in one! A science room... student lounge... mathnasium... An experimental theater! All set for a production of Samuel Beckett's ""Endgame""!"
Lisa,"Ooh, a pull-down map of..."
Lisa,Nothing? And this ruler is unmarked and... the tabs on this pop-up book have no effect...and this tooth has no dentin! Everything is fake! What is going on?!
Lisa,"Principal Skinner, do you know anything about a bizarre hidden classroom underneath the school?"
Lisa,It's real. I can show you!
Lisa,You're just pressing a Mento.
Lisa,"And now without further ado, I give you... this!!!"
Lisa,I swear there was a room here!
Lisa,"I've got to get back in that room, but Skinner took away the only key! What would Nancy Drew do?"
Lisa,"Hi, my name is Lisa Simpson."
Lisa,That's us. Do you think you could reproduce the key in this photo?
Lisa,How much?
Lisa,Keep the change.
Lisa,How did this bookshelf get here so fast? I bet it's shoddy.
Lisa,"What do you think of that, Nancy Drew?"
Lisa,"Jeez, they're dropping like flies."
Lisa,The children are on Bus 23.
Lisa,Skinner's involved in this. Deep.
Lisa,You know anything about... Bus Twenty-three?
Lisa,"There's only one bed that's just right for me, the bed with the truth in it. Which is probably the third one."
Lisa,So the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge.
Lisa,That's where the ice bridge would be! Go down!
Lisa,"Dad, stop!"
Lisa,That's not a real arm -- it's plastic!
Lisa,"No, I mean they're mannequins!"
Lisa,Skinner and Chalmers loaded that bus with those kids... but why?
Lisa,Otto? Are you the one who left the message on the blackboard?
Lisa,"Otto, they're just mannequins!"
Lisa,"Well, there's one thing you didn't count on: my Dad getting a giant wedding cake and my sister locking herself in the car."
Lisa,"I'm sorry, but the team all got food poisoning at the pre-rally egg salad sandwich party. Luckily, as equipment manager, I... was not... invited! Woo-hoo!"
Lisa,"Actually, I do have a speech prepared!"
Lisa,You know I hate surprises!
Lisa,I like routine. I like routine.
Lisa,Please! I went through my T.R. phase in first grade. Now I realize that the greatest Roosevelt is Franklin.
Lisa,"Yeah, so he could shoot it himself. Franklin Roosevelt led this country through the depression and World War Two!"
Lisa,Face on a dime!
Lisa,"That's a lot of anger, Grampa."
Lisa,"Bart, what are you doing?"
Lisa,What?! I'm telling Mom!
Lisa,"Hello, Mom? You won't believe what Bart's doing."
Lisa,"Dad, I'm going to entertain you with the help of ""The Brothers Karamazov."" ""Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov... a landowner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper place."""
Lisa,"Da-ad! Anyway, continuing: ""For the present I will only say that this 'landowner' -- for so..."""
Lisa,"Ew, Dad! Wait a minute... Can you pass gas at will? Fart once for no, twice for yes."
Lisa,Oh my God! Do you realize what this means?
Lisa,"Well, it means that you can communicate!"
Lisa,Exactly!
Lisa,"I'll recite the alphabet, and you tell me when to stop. A-B-C-D..."
Lisa,"Okay, first letter ""D."" Next letter: A-B-C-D-E-"
Lisa,"""D, E""... Amazing! Oh, but before we continue..."
Lisa,Okay: A--
Lisa,"""D, E, A..."""
Lisa,"""Dearest Marge, though my body cannot move, my heart still beats and my brain still brains."""
Lisa,I miss holding you in my arms more than my butt can say.
Lisa,"""Perhaps someday there will be a cure. Although if it requires months of difficult physical therapy, I'll pass."""
Lisa,"""You are the shining light that gets me through my darkest hours. For further communication I will require more beans. I love you, baby."""
Lisa,All strapped in?
Lisa,Now prepare to take an incredible journey across the room!
Lisa,"Halloween is over, which means America, it's time to start your Christmas shopping. Infuse our stagnant economy with dollars you don't really have."
Lisa,"Bart, you wanna see something cool?"
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"My science fair project proves that an asteroid will strike the earth on July 15, 9789."
Lisa,"Fine. Good luck with your project, which I'm sure you haven't started yet."
Lisa,That's pathetic.
Lisa,"Bart, isn't that awfully similar to the cootie patch you did last year?"
Lisa,It's about an asteroid!
Lisa,"It wasn't a pie, it was science! And it's not fair -- my project was way better than Bart's, and I didn't have help from a nerd! I'm my own nerd!"
Lisa,"Wow! While I was sitting here feeling sorry for myself, Bart's invention actually changed someone's life!"
Lisa,Video game convention!
Lisa,"This game has all the best college marching bands! From the precision footwork of Ohio State to the lame, dead-on-arrival humor of Stanford!"
Lisa,"Uh-oh, I'm losing the crowd!"
Lisa,This is the funnest game ever!
Lisa,She means the most authentic.
Lisa,Fun Dad rocks!
Lisa,Yay! / X-Games! X-Games! / Alright!
Lisa,Are there at least games here?
Lisa,Yes it is! That's all it is!
Lisa,"Don't worry about it, Mom. Dad will take us on a great outing next weekend."
Lisa,"Mom, we're hungry!"
Lisa,"Relax, Mom -- be adventurous."
Lisa,"Exotic... vegetarian... I can mention it in a college essay... Mom, this is amazing!"
Lisa,"Mom, they're here on purpose! They're foodies."
Lisa,Uhh... before the Koreans?
Lisa,Goorsha!
Lisa,Goorsha!
Lisa,Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha!
Lisa,What kind of American man doesn't want to explore global food culture?
Lisa,"We should start our own food blog... ""The Three Mouthketeers!"""
Lisa,People are loving our list of Springfield's top ninety-nine Afghan restaurants.
Lisa,Whoa! / Cool!
Lisa,"It's called ""El Chemistri"" and they use science to make the food!"
Lisa,Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!
Lisa,"Yeah-huh: Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan."
Lisa,I can't believe Dad is missing this!
Lisa,"Wow Mom, that was awesome!"
Lisa,Gift shop!
Lisa,"No fair! This isn't big, it's medium!"
Lisa,What?
Lisa,He gets four and I only get two?! No fair!
Lisa,NO FAIR!
Lisa,Hey -- I know you...
Lisa,Wait! Wait! Come back! Dad! Follow that dinosaur!
Lisa,You're T.R. Francis! You wrote the Angelica Button books! They're my favorite fantasy novels!
Lisa,But why are you working at a dinosaur show? And why did you run away from me? And how did Angelica get a new wand after Baron Mortdeath burned the Wandwood Forest? And--
Lisa,Of course you're real! Everybody knows you got the idea for this series after an explosion at a crumpet factory knocked you off a double-decker bus. How could that be made up?!
Lisa,Everything I believed about young adult literature is a lie!
Lisa,Can I have my allowance early? I need to buy some carbon-offset credits so I can burn all my Angelica Button books.
Lisa,Doesn't it bother you that Betty Crocker is an invention of twenties-era ad men?
Lisa,Can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?
Lisa,"Every book on the ""Young Adult"" charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids!"
Lisa,And they just cash their checks and get away with it every time! It's the perfect crime -- as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds.
Lisa,You're group-writing a book?! But the only reason anyone would ever do that is... profit!
Lisa,I'll show you! I'll write a book myself! A personal story my readers will connect with!
Lisa,"This is how real writers do it. I'll just bang out two thousand words and then I'll stop, even if I'm on fire. I gotta pace myself. ""Chapter one."" Wait, I can't start without music to inspire me."
Lisa,Why is Bach next to Muddy Waters? That's my problem -- I gotta get these CDs organized!
Lisa,"There, finished. Now if I win just two more games of online Boggle, I'll be ready to start writing."
Lisa,"Spot, stop, sop, top-tops, pot-pots, opt-opts, post!"
Lisa,"Sitting in a coffee shop -- I couldn't feel more like a real writer! Oh, Better set up my wi-fi in case I need to do some research! But if I'm gonna use their free internet, I really should buy something."
Lisa,"God, I love being a writer!"
Lisa,I've got it! A mermaid falls in love with a boy on land... I'm a genius!
Lisa,Writing is the hardest thing ever!
Lisa,Coming to the book fair was a great idea... 'Cause you can't write if you don't know what the competition's up to!
Lisa,A dog wrote a bestseller?! Aargh! All I've done is procrastinate! Who am I kidding? There will never be a book with my name on it.
Lisa,Do I have to do any writing?
Lisa,I'm in.
Lisa,"I was raised in a traveling circus. My mother was a lady ringmaster and my father was a lion barber. I wrote my first story with clown lipstick on a flattened popcorn box. It was featured in The New Yorker's ""Best Forty Under Four"" issue."
Lisa,What happened to me? In one vulnerable moment I became the thing I hated most -- a literary fraud.
Lisa,"Aww, I've always wanted an Aiden..."
Lisa,"No, guys... it was me."
Lisa,My name is finally on a book!
Lisa,And they're letting me write the sequel! A hard deadline is just the kick in the pants I need to focus and get some serious writing done!
Lisa,I'm sorry.
Lisa,"No need to thank me, boys."
Lisa,You could never have printed your version of the book without the publisher's password...
Lisa,So I pretended to betray you... then after he typed the password...
Lisa,I secretly switched the flash drives.
Lisa,I got the idea from every movie ever made.
Lisa,"And the best part is, my face is still on the back flap."
Lisa,Gaiman!
Lisa,Krappy the Klunk.
Lisa,See?
Lisa,"Dad, you were supposed to read me a bedtime story."
Lisa,Does anybody want my opinion?
Lisa,Proceed to the page with the butterfly bookmark as I cuddle up with Madame Bunny.
Lisa,Genius.
Lisa,Patience! Patience! Get on with it!
Lisa,"Well, I could help you..."
Lisa,"Well, you're getting my help."
Lisa,Don't you want to be able to read the things people carve into your chest in prison?
Lisa,"We did it, Bart! I'm a mentor!"
Lisa,No Bart! You can read other books too!
Lisa,"Um, I think we're supposed to get off here."
Lisa,Hurry! We're heading for the falls!
Lisa,"Mo-om, what are you doing?"
Lisa,Why can't we visit a real museum? One that doesn't have the skeletons of the Three Stooges in the lobby?
Lisa,"Hm, they're selling off all the old TV relics."
Lisa,I liked the knowledgeable docents.
Lisa,Krusty?
Lisa,"Well, you're not exactly my hero. I see you more as a cautionary tale."
Lisa,"You're not licked, Krusty. People love a comeback. Look at Robert Downey Junior... Mickey Rourke..."
Lisa,"You need an agent? We met a ten percenter today. She'll get you meetings with the eye, the peacock, the alphabet web. You'll have a skein on the sked before you can say ""Krusty's wardrobe furnished by Ha-Has of Beverly Hills""."
Lisa,"Ms. Dubinsky, can you please just tell us why you hate Krusty?"
Lisa,Um... who says we're gonna have kids of our own?
Lisa,They self-reference each other.
Lisa,I need my books!
Lisa,We're not with him.
Lisa,Looks like we're back to traveling on tramp steamers and produce trucks.
Lisa,It's too early to call shotgun!
Lisa,"Dad, you out-talked the talking heads!"
Lisa,"Dad, I'm glad your show is successful, but I have to ask you: what's with the crying?"
Lisa,"So, what's this with the gravy boat?"
Lisa,"You know, symbols can often rile people up. The swastika... the New York Yankees logo..."
Lisa,"Um, none."
Lisa,"Dad, you shouldn't do this. It's not fair how much influence you have!"
Lisa,You're endorsing Ted Nugent for President?! He's a right-wing rock star who likes everything I hate!
Lisa,"Dad, you cannot endorse Ted Nugent. I mean, sure, we all love his music..."
Lisa,No question about it.
Lisa,But he's out of his mind -- he can't run for President!
Lisa,"Oh, Dad! I'm so glad you've heard the voice of reason."
Lisa,"Dad, no!"
Lisa,"Maybe because deep down, you know you don't believe in what you're doing."
Lisa,"I knew you were, Dad. I always knew."
Lisa,"Well, it all started a couple of months ago..."
Lisa,"Like all too many stories about my family, it began with somebody watching television."
Lisa,"Hm, I kinda want to create my own thing. Do you sell any just plain sets?"
Lisa,"Well, I'll just buy one of these and build something different."
Lisa,"Trust me, I've left a lot out, and cleaned up the swears. Anyway, I ran into some schoolmates and thought they might be friendly. That's what kids do, right? Hang out at the mall together. But when I went over..."
Lisa,"Hi, guys, what are you doing?"
Lisa,Can I join you?
Lisa,They-they don't?
Lisa,What the--
Lisa,I have no friends.
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,I'd have more friends if I knew what people liked. But I won't know what people like unless I'm their friend. It's a conundrum.
Lisa,Hm...
Lisa,It's easier to be friends with lots of people online than one person in person. What if I started an online meeting place where all are equal and I am the undisputed center?
Lisa,"No, that is not true! I--"
Lisa,All right already! I had no friends.
Lisa,"So, since I had no friends, I assembled a motley crew of the friendless to help me construct my social network. Did we become friends? No."
Lisa,"As the CEO of SpringFace, I want you all to have fun as you write source code until you fall asleep at your consoles."
Lisa,"Nelson, you've just given us the template for our site!"
Lisa,I never said it was diabolical!
Lisa,Hit refresh.
Lisa,Hit refresh.
Lisa,I have a thousand friends! And only eight of them are Milhouse.
Lisa,"Wait a minute, grownups are on this?"
Lisa,That's not you.
Lisa,"Wow, I've created something incredibly popular!"
Lisa,"Friend, friend, awaiting reply, friend..."
Lisa,Sherri? Terri? Hopscotch? Double Dutch? Ringolivio? Anyone?
Lisa,"I have a thousand friends, and I feel more alone than ever!"
Lisa,I'm trying to set a mood here.
Lisa,"As I was saying, SpringFace was used in ways I never expected."
Lisa,"I know it's awful and insular, and caused thirty-five deaths, but I had friends! Four digits of friends! I had a friend in common with Malcolm Gladwell!"
Lisa,Fine. I'll shut down the site.
Lisa,You really want me?
Lisa,Polo!
Lisa,"Even a kid who wears a ""Finding Nemo"" back brace has some pride. You went too far this time, Bart."
Lisa,Yes I did. Now I'm going to bed.
Lisa,Your bar is the closest thing this town has to an Algonquin roundtable.
Lisa,"Yeah, yeah, okay, second closest."
Lisa,"Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to be nosey."
Lisa,You have a way with words.
Lisa,"Mom, I'm gonna look at the desserts!"
Lisa,"Yep, you're the crack head. What dessert are you gonna get?"
Lisa,"Um, I should probably get back to my Mom. By the way, my name is--"
Lisa,Lisa. Now this is the most important place in the world.
Lisa,"This place is great! If I cover my peripheral vision, I feel like I'm in France!"
Lisa,Ew. How 'bout I'll just look at you.
Lisa,It's... nice.
Lisa,"Mom, I'm sorry I'm late! No excuse, I just forgot all about you. Huh? I'm not sure that patch really represents who I am right now."
Lisa,"Mom, I have a crush!"
Lisa,Somehow I missed that phase.
Lisa,The boy I like is Hemingway-esque!
Lisa,"Wow, Nick here in our house. I hope it doesn't make him think less of me."
Lisa,"Mom can't appreciate the kind of boy Nick is, because although I love Dad, he's a completely different creature."
Lisa,Nick and I met talking through a crack between two booths!
Lisa,"Man, that company thinks every time it adds a wisecracking parrot to a story, they own it."
Lisa,"Grampa, would you help take me on a foolish romantic mission?"
Lisa,Mulberry Island. We'll kiss there at sunset.
Lisa,Ow!
Lisa,"If we stop now, we'll never make it there by sunset."
Lisa,But Grampa...
Lisa,We could take this boat.
Lisa,I thought you rowed up the Zambezi without a guide.
Lisa,"You know, you were a lot more adventurous at the dessert table."
Lisa,Shut up and kiss me.
Lisa,"Wait, how long is this love for again?"
Lisa,"Hm, that's a pretty long time."
Lisa,"Thanks. But I couldn't have done it, Mom. I mean, the person you kiss under a mulberry tree is someone you'll love for the rest of your life."
Lisa,"I know it's futile, but I must again point out there is no dragon."
Lisa,"Again, I maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance."
Lisa,I pick up books like you pick up beers!
Lisa,"Do we really have to sit here the whole time? I mean, if we went out now, it might be cool to see the town empty."
Lisa,I could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!
Lisa,"If I didn't know better, I'd say it was a town meeting."
Lisa,Why would you want to banish us from Springfield?
Lisa,"Dad, where are we going? Do we have a plan?"
Lisa,"Ahhh, smell that unpolluted air! Y'know, I'm glad we're in exile."
Lisa,"It's not perfect here, but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind, Wikileaks is right over there."
Lisa,"Well, I did miss a few things about the grid... like everything!"
Lisa,"Maureen Dowd, we've got a lot of catching up to do."
Lisa,Dad? Dad?
Lisa,"Dad, I wanted to give you a heads-up. Mom's birthday is tomorrow. It's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present that's not completely insulting."
Lisa,Wha--? Mom is gonna love that!
Lisa,By who? Lenny?
Lisa,They have jellies made of fruits I've never heard of!
Lisa,These'll go great with betel nut butter!
Lisa,"But at the Kwik-E-Mart, the only fresh fruit is the one banana by the register."
Lisa,Wait! Maybe Paula Paul left a message.
Lisa,"Yo, mysterious pranksters, it's time for dinner."
Lisa,"Just throw in a couple of ""fur is murders."""
Lisa,Da-ad!
Lisa,Looks like Dad's not coming.
Lisa,You're an undercover cop?
Lisa,What is going on?
Lisa,We're actually entering Dad's dreams?
Lisa,"Listen, everyone! We should fall asleep in this dream! One minute at this level equals two hours one dream level below!"
Lisa,"Everything has rules, Bart."
Lisa,"Forsooth, a myst'ry-"
Lisa,We never do my thing!
Lisa,Gramma!
Lisa,We'll take your word for it.
Lisa,Power's out.
Lisa,...you promised to help me write a haiku...
Lisa,Thank you!
Lisa,"Dearly beloved, we are not here to mourn their deactivation, but to celebrate their period of function."
Lisa,"Dad, they can only go three miles an hour!"
Lisa,With great difficulty!
Lisa,"Wow, the TV's hooked up to the internet! You can stream whole seasons of old TV shows."
Lisa,"""Stranded"" was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes. It was huge! Well, the first season and the last season."
Lisa,"Hello, lovebirds."
Lisa,"I've been following your storyline from afar, Bart, waiting for that inevitable point where you get into trouble you couldn't get out of. Perhaps I could broker a settlement."
Lisa,"Hear, hear!"
Lisa,I don't think Shauna should choose any of you. Shauna should choose Shauna.
Lisa,"Well Bart, I guess that's our cue to skedaddle..."
Lisa,"Face it, we're just kids. We can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. All we have in the world are the things our parents give us."
Lisa,"I sold a couple of my rare jazz records. After a while they all start to sound the same. Still love the genre, of course. Not even close to getting sick of it."
Lisa,"And Dad donated something, too."
Lisa,"Well, well, Mr. Never-Wrong was right again -- family vacations always suck. I called it. Called. It."
Lisa,Kidzone... Let me guess: a broken foosball table and a game of Clue missing its candlestick.
Lisa,It's so diverse! I've died and gone to a PBS kids show!
Lisa,Two!?!!!
Lisa,Two diplomats' sons are in love with me. Who will I choose: Ghana or Portugal?
Lisa,Sweet? Sweet?! The passengers on this ship could be the last people on earth!
Lisa,"Like monks during the dark ages, it's up to the KidZone: Elite to make a record of human culture."
Lisa,This group is adapting children's classics for the stage to entertain generations of survivors.
Lisa,"Bart, how could you?"
Lisa,"From egg to baby to grownup, we can see them living their entire penguin lives from up here!"
Lisa,This stupid prank is the most selfish thing you've ever done!
Lisa,"Hey, up here! You've gotta see this!"
Lisa,The penguin's life isn't all bad. Those ones are having a blast!
Lisa,"Well sure life is full of pain and drudgery, but the trick is to enjoy the few perfect experiences we're given in the moment."
Lisa,Hold that thought. I'm tuning my saxophone. Sharp. Flat. Sharp.
Lisa,"Nelson, don't you want my lunch money?"
Lisa,"That's sexist, but thank you."
Lisa,"Well, if you must... see if you can find out where my dolls are."
Lisa,I just want closure.
Lisa,That's Nelson!
Lisa,Krusty! This once-vibrant young bully won't even live to pick on kids in junior high! Because he's been eating nothing but your food!
Lisa,Do you actually serve those items?
Lisa,"Well, he's tough on nerds, but easy on the eyes."
Lisa,Nothing.
Lisa,Dad?
Lisa,"First of all, congratulations on getting the lead."
Lisa,I just hope you're gonna take this seriously.
Lisa,"Dad, the story of the passion is the cornerstone of the Christian faith. And although I personally follow the enlightened teachings of Lord Buddha, messing with Jesus really gets people mad -- it's like wearing a Florida State jersey to a Florida game."
Lisa,It'll be fine. Just learn your lines.
Lisa,He's in every scene.
Lisa,"Oooh, look at these: ""Extreme Weddings"" triathlon, zero G... ""tie the knot at the top of Mt. Everest?!"""
Lisa,They have Itchy and Scratchy weddings?
Lisa,"Mr. Szyslak, I have a feeling there's going to be one more act to this story."
Lisa,"Bart, aren't you gonna tell Mom and Dad about the problem you have?"
Lisa,I'm just saying it won't get better unless you talk to an adult.
Lisa,That's my brother! Four years out of four.
Lisa,"What?! ""Least Popular?"" I gotta go."
Lisa,Um... thank you for noticing me?
Lisa,You said they'd take it easy on me!
Lisa,"Um, can I be excused from holding up my end of the conversation?"
Lisa,"Let's see... ""Uncensored Jump-rope Chants""... Oh, there's a whole thread labeled ""Lisa Simpson!"""
Lisa,"Y'know, it seems like more than a coincidence that Milhouse brought it to our attention."
Lisa,Yep. Message boards are never wrong.
Lisa,Dutch?
Lisa,Forgive a fool her tears.
Lisa,Fifth-graders? Ooh-la-la! They get to put their desks in a circle!
Lisa,"So, when's the party?"
Lisa,That's mine!
Lisa,Give that back!
Lisa,"What is the point? I think this is the end of me. All I had was my integrity. And now that's gone. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I try not to cry till you're asleep."
Lisa,"Look, if I could just spend a few days in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up, I think I might have a chance to..."
Lisa,It's not a frown. It is a straight line of resignation. Looks just the same upside down.
Lisa,"Dad, if you really wanna help, please stop trying to help."
Lisa,"I'm sorry, I don't really want to be here."
Lisa,"Please, I've had enough attention for one day!"
Lisa,Oh God.
Lisa,This is where I live.
Lisa,"Please, take your time."
Lisa,Solitude?
Lisa,"Let me explain. I have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if I give up hope. Now if you don't mind, and with all due worship, I would like to be alone."
Lisa,Can I please be alone?
Lisa,"Well, it worked once."
Lisa,Why do you keep telling me what I'm gonna do? This isn't about me.
Lisa,"You! It's about Hello, hello, Springfield. It's me, Gaga! Why is everyone looking at my purple hair full of bluebirds?"
Lisa,"Well, I denounce thee!"
Lisa,I denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill! And I denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy!
Lisa,I denounce thee! I denounce thee! I denounce thee!
Lisa,"Don't ""monster"" me."
Lisa,Are you crying... glitter?
Lisa,"Dad, thank you. Like always, the fact that I could tune you out without fearing I'd miss out on something, gave me the time to take stock, and realize how ungrateful I have been. Which means I've got a train to catch."
Lisa,Gaga!
Lisa,To thank you!
Lisa,"Look at me! You did help me, by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you. It was like a great sneeze. And now I can say what's good about me. And I can say it as Lisa Simpson! Just not that loud."
Lisa,"Well, I'm smart, nice, tolerant, funny but not ""mean funny,"" and I never forget a birthday, even for kids who move away."
Lisa,I'll do anything but sing!
Lisa,"I USED TO THINK THAT I WAS STUPID, WORTHLESS, WEAK, AND WRONG"
Lisa,A MOCKINGBIRD WITHOUT A SONG...
Lisa,I WAS SMALL INSIDE AND LACKING PRIDE...
Lisa,ON A ONE-WAY TRAIN TO BE MILHOUSE'S BRIDE...
Lisa,"I LOVE NPR, AND JAZZ GUITAR..."
Lisa,SOME DAY I'LL DESIGN A SOLAR CAR!
Lisa,"THAT'S RIGHT, I'M LISA SIMPSON, SUPERSTAR!"
Lisa,LISA SIMPSON / LISA SIMPSON
Lisa,LISA SIMPSON SUPERSTAR!
Lisa,LISA SIMPSON / LISA SIMPSON...
Lisa,LISA SIMPSON SUPERSTAR!
Lisa,"And the best thing is, even if they weren't waving, it would be okay."
Lisa,A peloton?
Lisa,Meaningless friend thing.
Lisa,We're not having a baby!
Lisa,Oh brother. Let's dance.
Lisa,Hey Bart? At least I've got a date!
Lisa,"Now you listen to me, Bart. Milhouse may not be the perfect date..."
Lisa,But...
Lisa,At least I'm with someone who tries a little too hard because he really likes me.
Lisa,"Yeah, for about a week. But as soon as they get to know the real you, they departo de Barto. And that's why you're alone tonight."
Lisa,Fievel was a mouse in a movie.
Lisa,Can't Dad take Bart while we seek out culture?
Lisa,"Well, at least I'll be able to say I went to a Broadway show."
Lisa,"All right, Broadway's too expensive, the museums are over-curated -- but Shakespeare in the Park is tonight, and the tickets are free!"
Lisa,"Not so fast! We came for Shakespeare, and we're gonna see Shakespeare!"
Lisa,"Anyone who wants to be in this, grab a doublet and meet me backstage!"
Lisa,I was thinking amateurs only.
Lisa,"Fine, you're in."
Lisa,"Oh, for the love of God."
Lisa,"Hey, don't ever stop, because tonight we made it in New York!"
Lisa,"Hey! I specifically said no critics! This is outrageous! Ooh, but they like me!"
Lisa,But we're here to ask if you have an idea for a couch gag.
Lisa,Huh?
Lisa,A mini black hole!
Lisa,"Oh no, I've got to take it away before more clueless kids fall into it!"
Lisa,"Um, it's a lot worse than a stray dog."
Lisa,It's a black hole!
Lisa,"Are you sure your next guess wasn't ""three stray dogs?"""
Lisa,"Yes, it's the preferred term. And most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out. But some think they may be a gateway to other universes."
Lisa,"Guys, stop throwing things in the hole -- the more you throw in, the bigger and more dangerous it becomes!"
Lisa,"Dad, don't pat it!"
Lisa,"Dad, that's creepy."
Lisa,The black hole is looking a lot bigger. Does anybody want to admit to throwing things in?
Lisa,And I have to ask... has anyone seen the cat?
Lisa,"Stop! This is a black hole, not a lawn and leaf bag! If one more thing gets in there it could reach critical mass!"
Lisa,Noooo!
Lisa,You tossed your car keys in my bean plant!
Lisa,Why is this happening to us?
Lisa,But--
Lisa,"Mom, what's going on?"
Lisa,It's Moe with wings!
Lisa,I thought I was the favorite.
Lisa,Not the favorite! Not the favorite!
Lisa,Achem!
Lisa,Me neither.
Lisa,"I think it's ""new car smell."""
Lisa,Bart! What are you doing in my room?!
Lisa,What do you do Tuesdays and Thursdays after school?
Lisa,A gentleman doesn't ask and a lady doesn't tell.
Lisa,I guess.
Lisa,I know why they're here!
Lisa,Because they can't let me have a secret. It drives them crazy.
Lisa,Cursive writing. I'm learning cursive. All these sentences have every letter of the alphabet in them.
Lisa,I hope you're happy. You all just wasted your time working your way into an afterschool class.
Lisa,You put my college fund on a poker site?!
Lisa,Well... at least I have a college fund!
Lisa,More importantly it's a college fund...
Lisa,"Dad, please!"
Lisa,Where'd you get that shirt?
Lisa,Are you playing poker with my college fund?
Lisa,Get your hands off my future!
Lisa,"New low, even for this family... college fund on a poker site... I'm just gonna log right out."
Lisa,Get outta here!
Lisa,Huh. Two queens. That's a great start.
Lisa,"Well, maybe I can just win the sixty-two dollars back."
Lisa,Four queens! Yes! Yes!!!
Lisa,"All due respect, Mr. Flanders, could I have a little privacy?"
Lisa,Please? Thank you.
Lisa,Yeah! Fifty dollars up! Time to play with house money!
Lisa,Shoo!
Lisa,How did he...
Lisa,"I've read every expert on poker, and watched Jennifer Tilly's DVD."
Lisa,"And money is college, which should lead to more money some day, but who knows anymore?"
Lisa,"Okay, education paid for. With a gap year, to find myself. Every nerve in my body is screaming ""cash out now,"" and yet... I've got a pair of aces!"
Lisa,"Full house! Aces over threes! Take that, rich-texan-oh-oh-one, and sideshow-bob-at-springfield- penitentiary. Ha! I'm going all in!"
Lisa,What? He didn't fold? But that's insane unless he has...
Lisa,"Four threes?! Oh no! No-no-no-no-no, nooooo!"
Lisa,"Can't breathe... I've lost, I've lost everything."
Lisa,This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me! I was Ivy! Strong Ivy!
Lisa,What are you talking about?
Lisa,Oh my God! You won the pot? You must have nearly a million dollars! I can go to college and live like a Kennedy.
Lisa,"Well, back to square one is a major victory in this house, but why did you help me?"
Lisa,"C'mon, tell me!"
Lisa,What? You did?
Lisa,Sure. I have the ending for my memoir!
Lisa,It's not the vegetarianism!
Lisa,Lisa.
Lisa,All day I have vitamin burps.
Lisa,Mmm! Tasty! Love the texture. What is it?
Lisa,But I'm a vegetarian!
Lisa,Really?
Lisa,This is such a big step!
Lisa,"Mm, that is good grub."
Lisa,But I promised Paul McCartney I wouldn't eat meat.
Lisa,"So if I'm growing grasshoppers to eat, am I a farmer or a rancher? There are gonna be a lot of heated blogs on this topic."
Lisa,"You know, shrimp aren't all that removed from grasshoppers. They're both arthropods..."
Lisa,You did that to help me out!
Lisa,Not sure what your motivation for that is.
Lisa,"Get along, little buggies!"
Lisa,You don't feel any pain.
Lisa,Um... I just assumed?
Lisa,Nooo!
Lisa,Nooo!
Lisa,"Oh, thank God! Just a dream!"
Lisa,I've been meat-walking!
Lisa,"Bart! I can't eat bugs anymore. Please, please, take my grasshoppers as far away as you can and release them into the wild."
Lisa,I'll be cool.
Lisa,He's there too?!
Lisa,"Okay, Mom. I think that's far enough."
Lisa,"Finally, a place where you can spread your wings and hop."
Lisa,The dog's got the mumps.
Lisa,"Willie, I love your chaps."
Lisa,"I bought you a ticket for the MyPad raffle, Dad."
Lisa,"Dad, check this out!"
Lisa,"Dad, a mother giraffe is giving birth!"
Lisa,"Dad, the baby giraffe is taking its first steps!"
Lisa,"Dad, pay attention to your children!"
Lisa,Amen.
Lisa,Whoa.
Lisa,"Look at these obscure card games! Hey, do you have ""Uno?"""
Lisa,I didn't know that was an option.
Lisa,I can finally compost!
Lisa,At the art walk we walked into a gallery and it was just a guy crying -- that was the art!
Lisa,"Check it out, the New York Times travel section just named Springfield ""America's Coolest City."""
Lisa,"Please, please take me with you! I am one of you! I understood all your references!"
Lisa,No matter where you go... I will find you!
Lisa,The back yard?! But what if he got out through your half-completed tunnel to Flanders's fridge?
Lisa,"I love that dog, but that is one long, stupid name."
Lisa,"Dad, I just noticed something: you're not upset enough about this."
Lisa,What?! You cry all the time! You cried when they canceled that show you hated.
Lisa,How did Santa's Little Helper get in there?
Lisa,"Well, it's time we showed this dog some love!"
Lisa,You never take him for walks or sleep with him in your arms. And I suspect you've been chewing on his treats.
Lisa,What just happened? Who's Bongo?
Lisa,Wait. How could you know what Herman said? You were driving away.
Lisa,But I wanna know about Dad and his broken heart.
Lisa,"Grampa, why is the saddest story you ever told the only one that's ever made sense?"
Lisa,What's hopeless?
Lisa,"Whatcha reading, Dad?"
Lisa,"When grownups say that, it means there is something to worry about."
Lisa,What does that mean?
Lisa,"Every time you wake us up early in the morning, it's either church or we have to change our identities."
Lisa,You said you cut the wires to the alarm!
Lisa,"Dad, there are lights following us!"
Lisa,What happened with the E.M.P.?
Lisa,"Guys, can't you see that even an imperfect society is better than the savagery of creating a new one? I for one am glad we're stuck with civilization and I think we will be for a long, long time."
Lisa,Well I'm glad you're not upset. All my extra credit points are like frequent flyer miles on a bankrupt airline.
Lisa,You didn't?! Is there no limit to your disrespect?
Lisa,"Wait a minute... if you take the test now, your score could raise the average and save the school!"
Lisa,Proctor Clarkeson -- one student still hasn't taken the test!
Lisa,It's Bart.
Lisa,"So, how's the studying going?"
Lisa,This is the most selfish thing you've ever done!
Lisa,"You're letting your friends go hang because you are lazy, and selfish, and-- Hey, are you falling asleep just to spite me?!"
Lisa,"Spinach farm, huh? That's right, you talk in your sleep."
Lisa,"Look, the thing is, it's more important to know how to take a test than knowing what's on it. So, do the ones you know first. If you don't know one, guess B and move on. Now, what is the capital of Massachusetts?"
Lisa,Very good.
Lisa,I don't like this game! Nobody likes this game! Even the kids on the box look bored!
Lisa,They're miserable.
Lisa,Twister!
Lisa,No! Outside the house!
Lisa,It was so scary thinking something might happen to you guys.
Lisa,Where are we going?
Lisa,With nametags on them?
Lisa,This is a pretty important decision.
Lisa,Someone's smitten.
Lisa,Another surfer?
Lisa,Things that you're desperately missing from your life that you never knew you needed.
Lisa,What's that stone around your neck?
Lisa,"Princeton, B.A., Oxford, M.A. -- I smell a Rhodes."
Lisa,I'm exactly the kind of kid he's pretending to be.
Lisa,"Portia, you're the woman I dream of becoming, but Mom is my Mom."
Lisa,There is nothing like your biological family.
Lisa,"Mary, could I steal Bart for a minute?"
Lisa,"Bart Simpson, I don't know what the future holds for you..."
Lisa,"...but, Bart, I do know this: you will not do better than Mary Spuckler, so don't ignore her for a stupid video game!"
Lisa,"Ew! On every level! Ew! Bart, you have to treat girls like they matter -- not like they're a bunch of Milhice. What? It's the plural of Milhouse. Look it up."
Lisa,"What I'm saying applies to you too, Dad."
Lisa,"Don't you see, you're taking women for granted. And aside from being lumped together and generalized about, it's the one thing all women hate."
Lisa,Compliment her!
Lisa,"No, you're watching Baby Poindexter, the most educational DVD available at the checkout aisle at the grocery store!"
Lisa,Bart? You wanted to show me something?
Lisa,Wait a minute. Didn't Bart and I both watch this thing when we were little?
Lisa,"Well, the obvious question is... why did I turn out so... academically superior... while Bart--"
Lisa,What?!
Lisa,"Oh great, another invasive Skype from Mil-- huh?"
Lisa,He's right here.
Lisa,"Dad, why are you kowtowing to Mr. Van Houten?"
Lisa,Dad?!
Lisa,"Mom, I think Maggie misses TV."
Lisa,"You know Mom, I was thinking we could take Maggie downtown. ""The Jazz Hole"" is featuring a Dizzy Gillespie tribute band. Their trumpeter has the puffiest cheeks..."
Lisa,I get it. Middle child. Never do what I want.
Lisa,"Okay, I also know of a puppet show..."
Lisa,Really? Who?
Lisa,Milhouse?
Lisa,"Well, Milhouse, you might get past the bouncer at the jazz club because they're in no position to turn anyone away. But it doesn't matter, 'cause we can't pay for the gas and the cover fee anyway."
Lisa,They're not gonna write a check to a couple of kids.
Lisa,"Thanks, but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans doesn't make you man enough to be my dad."
Lisa,"Now remember, I can't sit backwards or I get sick."
Lisa,Your intellect-deadening DVDs turned my brother's brain to jelly.
Lisa,It's just enough to get home. I'm hungry now.
Lisa,"Guys, look!"
Lisa,"Free breakfast if we sit through a sales pitch. Just remember, Milhouse, do not buy the condo."
Lisa,"Well, before our dad signs any contracts, he has a surprise for you..."
Lisa,Kirk? Don't you have something to tell her?
Lisa,"Hmm, you're right. It is the golden age of well-written, brilliantly-acted TV shows."
Lisa,It looks like you're not the only predatory opportunist in town.
Lisa,I've got perfume spritzers.
Lisa,Property of Abraham J. Simpson? This is Grampa's stuff!
Lisa,Why don't you put a personal ad on the internet? That's how young people date these days.
Lisa,I know. It's weird to me too.
Lisa,"""Gorilla Joe,"" ""Gorilla Sam,"" ""Gorilla Pete,"" ""Ook and Eek, the Gorilla Twins""... Where did Mr. Burns dig up all these old wrestlers?"
Lisa,SCORRRE!
Lisa,Why do you think bad guys are so cool?
Lisa,Do not. That's ridiculous-- It's just-- It's that-- He's-- He's a rebel and only I can change him!
Lisa,I got one for just watching the game.
Lisa,Why are you so mean to me?
Lisa,"Please let it be someone smart, motivated, and who won't just teach us corporate-sponsored lessons."
Lisa,Confident... Vassar sticker on the windshield... could it be... do I detect... enthusiasm?!
Lisa,She's brought her own orrery!
Lisa,And it's got no Pluto! How cutting edge!
Lisa,Please-be-her! Please-be-her!
Lisa,"Lisa Simpson, hi. As second grade student-faculty liaison, I'd like to welcome you-"
Lisa,"Well, while you're grading so generously... here's mine."
Lisa,Meat?!
Lisa,Fur?!
Lisa,"But I am playing! I'm hop-scotching from paragraph to paragraph, climbing the monkey bars of plot and theme."
Lisa,"Please keep them together! If not for me, for the mother!"
Lisa,The joeys go in feet first!
Lisa,Chauncey!
Lisa,Ms. Cantwell?
Lisa,More than I want unicorns to be real!
Lisa,I remind you of you?
Lisa,This class doesn't give demerits.
Lisa,What if I home school?
Lisa,Principal Skinner...
Lisa,"""Ann, Mark, Bill and Sally are on the Ferris wheel. Ann is behind Sally. Mark is in front of Bill."
Lisa,Better switch to Social Studies.
Lisa,Eleanor Roosevelt became Franklin's 'eyes and ears...'
Lisa,I have a bully at school.
Lisa,My bully is my teacher.
Lisa,We don't have the metric system.
Lisa,Can I ask you guys something? Why does someone become a bully?
Lisa,But why would my teacher be a bully?
Lisa,My teacher's still bullying me.
Lisa,That just made it worse.
Lisa,"Ms. Cantwell, I can make this stop. All you have to do is... like me."
Lisa,Ms. Cantwell! Wait!
Lisa,I've got to know before you leave! Why don't you like me?
Lisa,That is so unsatisfying.
Lisa,You think I'm pretty?
Lisa,She hates me because I'm pretty!
Lisa,Can you sign my yearbook?!
Lisa,"Nice going, Bart. You've ruined Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter. The legendary grand slam."
Lisa,Wow -- he passed the Maggie test. And remember how Maggie solved Cookiegate?
Lisa,"To prove my brother's innocence, I demand a youth court!"
Lisa,"That's right! Bart must not be judged by these kids, but by a jury, of kids. Mostly these kids. There's only so many kids."
Lisa,"Good news, bad news. We're allowed to select the judge, but it's impossible to find one who doesn't hate you..."
Lisa,Sorry.
Lisa,I find that a little hard to believe.
Lisa,Grampa's story was true?
Lisa,Objection! Prejudicial!
Lisa,She sustained me!
Lisa,And do you think this boy took those eggs?
Lisa,But could Bart have gotten those eggs?
Lisa,No further questions.
Lisa,Why are you here?
Lisa,"Your Honor, I think we've seen enough. I have demolished the prosecution's claims and made the prosecutor sweat through two shirts."
Lisa,"I move that you dismiss this case, and release this sweet, lovable boy."
Lisa,The trial's not over and gravy is dead animal juice.
Lisa,Just remember this: a Simpson never gives up.
Lisa,"Mr. Burns, I came here because my brother is about to be wrongfully convicted. And the man I'm looking for would help me find the truth."
Lisa,And so I've learned that the only true Batmen are Christian Bale and Adam West. Why are you washing Bumblebee Man's pants?
Lisa,That's odd.
Lisa,This skirt has a small splatter...
Lisa,"Splatter, as if the egg had been crushed against it by hand--"
Lisa,--like someone faked being hit so they wouldn't be a suspect.
Lisa,What's that?
Lisa,This kilt says you framed my brother! Why?
Lisa,But how did you get the key?
Lisa,Aw... but I do hope you'll try to be good from now on.
Lisa,Today you were truly a hero. Thank you.
Lisa,"You know, if you're gonna be a hero, you might not want to tent your fingers like that."
Lisa,Maybe you should wrap your hands behind your head.
Lisa,Ah! Tenting! Tenting! Back to the tenting!
Lisa,I think our lunches got mixed up.
Lisa,Milhouse? Got anything good?
Lisa,"Ooh, a cupcake!"
Lisa,"Oh. Okay. If you'll excuse me, I have to go think of you in a different light."
Lisa,"I'm sorry I was inconsiderate, Milhouse. And furthermore, I respect you more for saying ""no."""
Lisa,I just have one thing to say...
Lisa,Chocolate or regular?
Lisa,Why am I doing this?
Lisa,"Milhouse, you'll probably think this is lame, but I was gonna go for a nature walk after school and I thought maybe you'd like to..."
Lisa,"Milhouse, seeing you there... saying nothing... it's the cutest you've ever been."
Lisa,"Hush, sweet boy. Let me get lost in the blue of your eyebrows."
Lisa,It came with fries or salad.
Lisa,"Well I wasn't sure, so I got both. Who knows her little Milhouse?"
Lisa,"Milhouse, I'm not sure why you left me in the forest, so I made cookies. But I didn't know what kind you liked, so I made you seven kinds. I've become my mother! Well, common sense never goes out of style That was too easy!"
Lisa,No. Nobody did.
Lisa,Bart! Milhouse!
Lisa,"Milhouse, are you okay?"
Lisa,I don't know... it's four days old... I just ate...
Lisa,Okay!
Lisa,"Aw, that's sweet."
Lisa,Our poor couch...
Lisa,I'm gonna put all my stuffed animals on it!
Lisa,"All right, get comfy."
Lisa,Those are bedbugs!
Lisa,"You know, in the Middle Ages people took refuge in church to escape the bubonic plague, but that made the plague spread even faster!"
Lisa,"I'm sorry your dress is gone, Mom."
Lisa,Well then you shouldn't feel bad because I can't imagine myself ever getting married.
Lisa,"Hey, I have a weakness for pomp!"
Lisa,"Mom, I found your wedding dress!"
Lisa,"Using something this town has never ever seen: good, honest police work."
Lisa,"I staked out the alley and befriended the garbage man who took it. Then he gave it to a local theater company, who used it in the first unsuccessful version of ""Mamma Mia."" In a bankruptcy sale, it was bought by a young couple. That couple right there!"
Lisa,"You never know, Mom. I'm only eight. I might get married someday... even if it's only a green card marriage to keep a Chinese dissident from being deported."
Lisa,Mom's deleting old TV shows off the DVR.
Lisa,Whatever Bart's doing it's got to be pretty bad for him to get me tickets to this amazing jam session!
Lisa,"All the greats are here -- Jellyroll Jones, Boston Cream Basie, Birthmark Billy Jackson, Grabass Walker, The Fatneck Sisters, and... Bleeding Gums Murphy?!"
Lisa,No! That's impossible! He's dead! I lay a saxophone reed at his grave every year.
Lisa,"It's a hologram?! Well, maybe if it's in good taste..."
Lisa,"Aw, c'mon."
Lisa,"Dear She-Done-Left-Me-Records. Once again, I write protesting your holographic exploitation of blues icon Bleeding Gums Murphy. I call for a boycott and girl-cott of your entire catalogue until you... Sonny Rollins?!"
Lisa,You're siding with record companies?
Lisa,"You're a hologram, aren't you?"
Lisa,Have you no shame?
Lisa,I was.
Lisa,"So you're saying Moe's Dumbo, his bourbon is the giant ears, and we're that flock of racist crows?"
Lisa,That's the kind of riff you can aim for after years of practice. We start off with the fun stuff: music theory.
Lisa,"Don't worry, music theory's just a fancy word for music math."
Lisa,Something smells fishy.
Lisa,"I guess Bart must be a musical genius, because frauds are always found out. Always."
Lisa,Ki-Ya Karate Monsters!
Lisa,Mom said we could watch it!
Lisa,Ki-Ya!
Lisa,It's for babies!
Lisa,Blob-Jitsu kick!
Lisa,It's Ki-Ya Karate Monsters.
Lisa,Samurai Shampoo Blast!
Lisa,Happy birthday dad! / Happy Birthday Grampa!
Lisa,Pill Attack!
Lisa,Ki-Ya--
Lisa,Ki-Ya!
Lisa,The geyser's one of the most famous natural wonders in... Iceland. I guess that's where Carl's from.
Lisa,"He said he went home, and his passport is gone. What country is he from?"
Lisa,Iceland keeps the most detailed family records of any country in the world.
Lisa,There... Carl was adopted... by a couple who lives outside Reykjavik.
Lisa,We're pretty broken.
Lisa,What is it? What is it? What is it?
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,Wait... you named me after a train?
Lisa,Are you sure mom is really gonna want a rusted-out kiddy train?
Lisa,"Aww, Dad, I just got a little twinge in my heart."
Lisa,Dad! Do we have to ride like this?
Lisa,Mom! Bart's twisting facts in an Orwellian fashion!
Lisa,"Orwell, obscure? The author of ""Animal Farm?"""
Lisa,"Happy anniversary, Mom!"
Lisa,Three kids with no money but plenty of love!
Lisa,Happy anniversary!
Lisa,THREE AWESOME KIDS AND A LIFE OF REGRET!
Lisa,"Oooh, there's new marshmallows in the Belfast Charms!"
Lisa,That's not right.
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,"I'm glad you're back, Dad. It's hard to sleep with one un-kissed cheek."
Lisa,Bart! Why is the Dad I always wished for creeping me out?
Lisa,Point taken.
Lisa,"Dad, what's that on your lap?!"
Lisa,Don't you think it's weird that dad stopped eating pork and drinking beer?
Lisa,Something happened to Dad on that trip. This is worse than when he went to New Orleans and came back with the southern accent.
Lisa,"Chief, is there really a terrorist threat to Springfield?"
Lisa,Intelligence?
Lisa,Dad's kneeling on a prayer mat! He doesn't believe in kneeling!
Lisa,Huh. It looks like he's praying...
Lisa,To the East! The Middle East! Mecca!
Lisa,He's targeting the nuclear plant?!
Lisa,Mom! I have to tell you something about Dad! Something big!
Lisa,Exactly!
Lisa,"But, but--"
Lisa,I think someone I love is a terrorist. Does that make me crazy?
Lisa,"I haven't heard anything about you, except from you."
Lisa,How much did you hear?
Lisa,Nothing really.
Lisa,"Dad, you're scary when you're calm and focused."
Lisa,When what's all over?!
Lisa,What other side?
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,Girl Scout cookies get you in anywhere.
Lisa,"Please, don't do this, Dad! I don't know what horrors you saw in Boise, but it's not worth blowing up everyone you love."
Lisa,Is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me?
Lisa,But I saw you praying to Mecca!
Lisa,"But wait, wait, wait! What is this?"
Lisa,I've told you that a million times!
Lisa,No one can use it but no one gets hurt!
Lisa,I can complete my Dad's mission just like George W. Bush.
Lisa,"We did it, Dad. We did it."
Lisa,You weren't shot!
Lisa,"You know, Dad, just because your mission's complete, it doesn't mean you have to go back to pork eating, and beer-drinking..."
Lisa,"'Twas Halloween night, with the kids door-to-dooring, and all over town blood sugar was soaring."
Lisa,But the Simpson abode was deep down in the dumps. 'Cause from little to bigger the kids had the mumps.
Lisa,Then we heard a loud crash...we were tempted to scat...
Lisa,The Fat in the Hat!
Lisa,"Say, Mr. Hat, I don't mean to complain, but you promised us candy, not mayhem and pain."
Lisa,...so we hitched us a ride on a three-hump gumbamel!
Lisa,"A gumbamel's a camel but faster and humbler. It doesn't take tips and it's never a grumbler. So if you must leave in a kind of a scramble, then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel."
Lisa,We thought we'd escaped from our psychotic guide...
Lisa,"But when we got home, he was waiting inside!"
Lisa,"Actually, there's a little more."
Lisa,I could do what I want to Bart's head?
Lisa,/
Lisa,You're rotating it in the wrong direction!
Lisa,"Well, now I always have someone to eat lunch with."
Lisa,"Rainbow... oh, Rainbow..."
Lisa,Why Bart? I thought we were friends!
Lisa,"Are you really, really sure?"
Lisa,"Well then, I guess I have no choice."
Lisa,"'Cause in a head-to-head battle, the one with the most brains wins!"
Lisa,"I feel your pain, brother."
Lisa,"Help me, doctor!"
Lisa,I won the science fair! I get to go to Chicago!
Lisa,"Eh, Bart, Bart, Bart."
Lisa,I have a solution!
Lisa,Maybe the best way to keep students from cheating is to trust them not to cheat.
Lisa,What I'm suggesting is we create an honor code.
Lisa,The students would do it.
Lisa,"If every student pledges not to cheat, and to turn in any cheater, no one will cheat the system because they'll be the system."
Lisa,"Hello, children. I hold before you a copy of the school's new honor code."
Lisa,"I know if I can get the toughest kid in class to sign it, the rest of you will sign it. Milhouse?"
Lisa,"Now, the smartest kid. Milhouse?"
Lisa,Now the class nerd. Milhouse?
Lisa,I guess I'll be getting some extra credit for this.
Lisa,"No, this is good."
Lisa,I got Bart's backpack.
Lisa,He got a hundred on his test?! That's impossible!
Lisa,Is Bart cheating?
Lisa,Bart! I'm gonna tell!
Lisa,"Oh my God, you found a loophole! Why don't you just put this much inventiveness into your work?"
Lisa,You've presented me with quite a conundrum.
Lisa,A word you should know since it was on a vocabulary test you aced.
Lisa,"But after some thought, all my worries went away."
Lisa,I know the answer. I'm gonna force you to turn yourself in.
Lisa,"Well Bart, is that enough of a sign for ya?"
Lisa,Did you know some historians think American football is based on an ancient Aztec game?
Lisa,"Bart, you're not annoyed that Milhouse asked me to go to the American football game instead of you?"
Lisa,American football.
Lisa,"Look, while I'd like to help, I'm kind of pessimistic about the team's chances."
Lisa,No you're not!
Lisa,"Wow! That was great! Can I have my regular clothes back, please?"
Lisa,I can't believe he pays you so little. The crowd was crazy about you.
Lisa,"Lisa. Guys, do you realize you're being exploited by this team?"
Lisa,They sell your posters...workout DVDs...and all of your practices are broadcast on a webcam.
Lisa,"And some of the angles are loooooow. But don't worry, collective bargaining will enable us to secure concessions."
Lisa,"We're gonna push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em way, way back! All the way to a new con-tract! 'Cause union power is a fact! And we're..."
Lisa,"Actually, I've been hit by the unfair labor practices bug."
Lisa,"How? By size, brand, value? And don't even suggest race, 'cause I don't see that. I just see little people I own. What do you say, ladies?"
Lisa,"Ooh, Good... nice... ""Beat Dallas."" Can never argue with that."
Lisa,"Okay guys, I got your ice creams."
Lisa,"Dad! We're missing ""The Giant Capybaras of Uruguay!"""
Lisa,Dad! Maggie's rolling away!
Lisa,"If they get her in their warrens, we'll never see her again!"
Lisa,"That's it, Maggie! Use the Dino-Wand!"
Lisa,Me too.
Lisa,ONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER THAT YOU'LL EVER DO...
Lisa,TWO CAN BE AS BAD AS ONE / IT'S THE LONELIEST NUMBER SINCE THE NUMBER ONE...
Lisa,"NO IS THE SADDEST EXPERIENCE YOU'LL EVER KNOW / YES, IT'S THE SADDEST EXPERIENCE YOU'LL EVER KNOW..."
Lisa,"'CAUSE ONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER THAT YOU'LL EVER DO / ONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER, WORSE THAN TWO... AND ONE-- You know, I really think I've made the point."
Lisa,A spitwad?
Lisa,"Well, at least I'm getting some attention."
Lisa,Begone!
Lisa,"Well, you're never alone surrounded by ""The Autobiography of Charles Manson."""
Lisa,"New kid? Um, have you made any friends?"
Lisa,That's a reference to the Brontë sisters!
Lisa,How do you know my name?
Lisa,Oh.
Lisa,Isabel!
Lisa,And don't you hate being the middle child?
Lisa,"It's raw veggies, they're supposed to be cold!"
Lisa,I'd better go.
Lisa,Oh my God. Someone wants to be my partner. Can't screw this up.
Lisa,Franklin Roosevelt bravely instituted a series of reforms called the New Deal...
Lisa,F.D.R.'s steadfast leadership also helped America win World War Two...
Lisa,A Lincoln Republican?
Lisa,A Reagan Republican?
Lisa,First President Bush?
Lisa,"Oh, dear God."
Lisa,That isn't a word.
Lisa,"I just can't believe someone like you would be a Republican. I mean, isn't your last name Gutiérrez?"
Lisa,"I'm just saying that people of your heritage... which could be any one of many heritages, I'm not pigeonholing... is it a Catholic thing?"
Lisa,"Yes, why?"
Lisa,My new best friend isn't what I thought. She's a... Republican.
Lisa,What is so funny? They're destroying the world!
Lisa,You voted for Reagan?!
Lisa,So... you were going through a phase?
Lisa,What are you trying to say?
Lisa,"Listen, I'm really sorry about..."
Lisa,What?! My Mom says you're going through a conservative phase!
Lisa,"Listen, we're both eight years old. Can't we just play Monopoly or something?"
Lisa,"Just can't resist those words ""signup sheet."" Oh, looks like I'll be running against Isabel. And Ralph?!"
Lisa,"Isabel! I want this campaign to be about the issues: same-sex fieldtrip buddies, providing class pets with a path to citizenship..."
Lisa,Ew. How long has it been since you washed your stomach?
Lisa,Cakey or gooey?
Lisa,What are you doing?!
Lisa,Well then you could use your free speech to denounce this intrusion of big money into our election.
Lisa,Pour me another.
Lisa,What are ya doing? S'imaginary.
Lisa,Fine. I gotta go.
Lisa,I'll see you later.
Lisa,"Bart, I need you to help me win the election."
Lisa,I'm fine with rough.
Lisa,You got it.
Lisa,You're just taking advantage of the situation.
Lisa,I'll make both.
Lisa,By discussing the school's budget crisis?
Lisa,"Organic gardening is an essential part of twenty-first century education, teaching both hands-on--"
Lisa,That's impossible. We've already had the best plumbers in the city look into it.
Lisa,What are you so happy about?
Lisa,Excellent.
Lisa,"What am I doing? Untent! Untent! Oh Bart, I want to win, but not like this. I'm sorry. You're fired!"
Lisa,"Okay, I'm a liberal. And sometimes that's a dirty word."
Lisa,"But what liberal really means, is someone who believes that those who have more than enough should share a little with those who don't."
Lisa,And those principles have consistently been in place during this country's most prosperous times. So if that's a liberal then I am a liberal... and hang me.
Lisa,"The Democratic Party pantheon. Such lofty ideals! And here come the spirits... Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale, John Kerry?! These are all losers!"
Lisa,What about Obama? Harry Truman? Bill Clinton?
Lisa,"So, do you know how I can win?"
Lisa,I know what I've got to do.
Lisa,"Hello, Isabel? Listen..."
Lisa,And I also wanna say that if--
Lisa,But I--
Lisa,"Congratulations, Isabel. I truly hope you enjoy the Friday morning council meetings and the, the free Snickerdoodle cookies."
Lisa,Hey. I'm sorry I fired you.
Lisa,"Thanks, Bart."
Lisa,They find me a pointy-haired know-it-all.
Lisa,What are you getting at?
Lisa,"Huh. You hear that world?! They love my ideas, just not me! And that is half the battle! Ha!"
Lisa,I didn't say anything.
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,"Good one, ding dong!"
Lisa,What are you doing?
Lisa,"Krusty, are you broke?"
Lisa,"You could do what ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" did."
Lisa,I mean you could sell foreign rights to your show. Even SpongeBob did it.
Lisa,"What I'm saying is, you could produce foreign versions of your TV show with actors from other countries..."
Lisa,Principal Skinner? I object to this arbitrary use of power and request I be taken off the list.
Lisa,Thank you.
Lisa,That sermon really inspired me. This whole Christmas has been about money...
Lisa,But I'm going to give gifts that aren't expensive and come from the heart.
Lisa,"Um, when a woman talks, she just wants to be heard."
Lisa,"Mr. Flanders, where's your store?"
Lisa,No thanks.
Lisa,"If I have to give presents, I'll give presents with a purpose. One for Maggie... check."
Lisa,All that's left is Bart.
Lisa,"No, no, no, no, no, no... ah, perfect!"
Lisa,An Angelica Button wizard robe... with wand pocket!
Lisa,Professor Digglesby's wand! Now I have every wizarding stick from the Spells and Potions Department of Wagglepoofs Academy!
Lisa,"I know this Christmas has been a little rocky even for the Simpsons. But I think these gifts born of thought and love will restore the balance of prajna and samsara, I mean holly and jolly."
Lisa,"Now dad, I'd like to give you your present."
Lisa,"Even better! They're bags of seeds, so that you can plant a garden and watch it grow."
Lisa,"Dad, stop!"
Lisa,"Well, at least you're eating vegetables."
Lisa,"Okay Bart, open your present. It's the one I'm most excited about."
Lisa,Nothing is easy to wrap. I have trouble with scissors!
Lisa,What? N.C. Wyeth! These are book illustrations!
Lisa,"Stop it, stop it! Why in the world would you burn a book?"
Lisa,Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury?
Lisa,How could you burn the present I gave you?
Lisa,"Bart, you were right."
Lisa,"No, about Christmas. So I went out this morning and I got you this."
Lisa,"It's a tablet with books on it, but also apps, like ""Worms With Friends."""
Lisa,I sold the gift you gave me.
Lisa,Get the twist?
Lisa,"Thanks, Bart. This'll make a lot of arctic loons very happy."
Lisa,"If Bart's going, I'm going!"
Lisa,You like this?
Lisa,They're gonna take Dad! We gotta do something!
Lisa,It's almost like having Dad here. Only with less growling when I go near his food.
Lisa,I don't know. It wasn't like Dad was stealing for himself. He created this wonderful experience for the whole town. I just can't imagine anyone turning him in.
Lisa,Dad! Dad! You're back! You're back!
Lisa,"Wait, I know one place in Springfield that doesn't care about internet piracy laws."
Lisa,Thanks for taking us in. Our family always appreciates asylum.
Lisa,The people of Sweden believe all movies should be shared freely.
Lisa,They've found us!
Lisa,These people hate my dad. How can they want to make a movie about him?
Lisa,And the worst one of all is--
Lisa,"Well, both groups claim their intentions are noble, but at the end of the day, they're both trying to steal as much money as they can."
Lisa,They'll just reboot Radioactive Man in an overpriced new origin issue and get clueless fanboys like you to line up at midnight to buy them.
Lisa,We'll explain it!
Lisa,They're giant polluters but the C.E.O. is a woman. It's very vexing.
Lisa,How does this mean anything when everyone's forced to do it?
Lisa,Not to.
Lisa,Dad! Bart's on my side of the seat!
Lisa,So the rumors are true: Moms can want things.
Lisa,"Hi, Ralph... um, I just wanted to tell you there was a tooth in the valentine you gave me."
Lisa,"I don't need a new Ralph, I like the old one. Happy Valentine's Day!"
Lisa,"No Bart, no. Do it and you'll always be known as the kid who ate the dead frog."
Lisa,That's someone who eats plants.
Lisa,What? A rule's a rule.
Lisa,I saw him heading across the field after school with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser.
Lisa,That doesn't sound like you.
Lisa,"You know, Bart, just because Diggs is a little different doesn't mean he's not a good person."
Lisa,I have about eight of them.
Lisa,"Oh, Bart... Diggs' problems don't have easy fixes."
Lisa,Well... sometimes it helps to know people feel for you. Want a hug?
Lisa,"Pass the peas, please."
Lisa,"We do have them! They're my home screen! Miss Hoover! Once again, the lesson plan I prepared would've covered this topic much better, but I can see..."
Lisa,Miss Hoover?
Lisa,"Bart, that's your sixth taco. You know, Whitman says, ""If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred""."
Lisa,Won't those vegetables go bad?
Lisa,Ew.
Lisa,"Overreactor dot org warns that over half of the vegetables sold in this country are ""Genetically Modified Organisms,"" whose effect on humans is... unknown!"
Lisa,"Whoa! Mom, you made me over-swipe!"
Lisa,Mom... can I visit Bob?
Lisa,Our school cafeteria is serving G.M.O.s -- genetically-modified organisms.
Lisa,Um... that video seemed a little... unscientific.
Lisa,Oh my God! It's worse than I thought. Everybody wait here while I do some actual research. Nobody form any opinions while I'm gone.
Lisa,I say we do not categorically ban genetically modified organisms.
Lisa,"Well, it's nice to see for once a corporation that does good work and cares about people."
Lisa,"You. He's tried to kill you. Me, I think he likes."
Lisa,And I refuse to concede a mind that thinks so much like mine can be all bad. Mom?
Lisa,Shut up!
Lisa,This is the pinnacle of conversation around here.
Lisa,I SAY ENGINEERED PO-TAY-TO / YOU SAY ENGINEERED PO-TAH-TO... POTATO!
Lisa,TOMATO!
Lisa,LET'S SPLICE SOME D.N.A.!
Lisa,"Bob, there's one thing I've gotta know: are you plotting revenge?"
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,You already ate all the chocolate bars.
Lisa,I like the Impressionists.
Lisa,Bob! You saved me! But how did you get the strength? Calder's work in this period was marked by heavy use of sheet metal painted to look deceptively airy.
Lisa,Thank you. Answer the question.
Lisa,"Well... there is something I should have told you. You see, it occurred to me that if I can genetically modify fruits and vegetables, why can't I modify... me!"
Lisa,You've been changing your DNA?!
Lisa,So... how strong are you?
Lisa,But... but we sang Gershwin together!
Lisa,"Well, I thought it was because it was Tote Bag day."
Lisa,You're going to take DNA from these historical figures and add it to your own?
Lisa,"More for mom, but yes."
Lisa,"Uh... Bob, you can't kill us without a little singing, right?"
Lisa,"To quote Whitman: ""This is what you shall do: love the earth and sun and animals, despise riches, stand up for the stupid and crazy..."""
Lisa,What? No!
Lisa,How veiled?
Lisa,Mom! Dad! The Retirement Home lost its license and Grampa has nowhere to live!
Lisa,"Dad, did it ever occur to you that we're learning how to take care of you when you're older by watching the way you treat Grampa?"
Lisa,Your Grampa's alive?
Lisa,"O-kay. Well, can you please be nicer to our Grampa? For me? I love Grampa. You may not realize it, but he's a treasure."
Lisa,Please.
Lisa,"I've never had a pet of my very own! My clock is ticking! I don't wanna be one of those girls who waits till she's sixteen to decide if she's ready, and then it's too late."
Lisa,"""I, Lisa Simpson, hereby promise to take full responsibility for this dog, cat, other."

Lisa,"Oh, my God -- I'm getting a guinea pig! Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!"
Lisa,This one whistled at me!
Lisa,"Oh, but that orange guy looks like a pumpkin! But this fella is so fuzzy!"
Lisa,"I'm sorry, Mom."
Lisa,"This one's nibbling a sunflower seed! Look at that hair -- Oh, I just wanna comb it forever! Have you seen a pinker nose? I have now!"
Lisa,"That one's fur looks like a tuxedo! A Band-Aid on its tail, awww! Albino!"
Lisa,"I'm definitely getting this one. Oh, but I forgot about this one! Oh my God I never even saw this one!"
Lisa,"Maybe I should get that sick one. If I don't, no one else will. Bart, list your top five, best to worst. No, no, no, no -- worst to best!"
Lisa,I just wish the grey one had the brown one's personality!
Lisa,"Dad, give me your phone. I need to look at the pictures again!"
Lisa,"Okay, this is the guinea pig that will make me happy."
Lisa,I could get two...?
Lisa,I've tried to give Pokey a perfect replica of his natural habitat:
Lisa,"Peruvian feather grass, an Incan sleeping mat, and a portrait of Marisol Espinoza, the Vice President of Peru."
Lisa,I wish I could live in there.
Lisa,Where'd he go?
Lisa,Nooooo!
Lisa,"Oh my God, he's in the walls!"
Lisa,I hear chewing!
Lisa,I've lost my guinea pig!
Lisa,Pokey!
Lisa,"Hey, look... there's a signature that the frame covered up: ""Johan Oldenveldt."""
Lisa,"Here he is! ""Johan Oldenveldt, painter, lived in Amsterdam, Paris... prolific early 20th century naturalist... I think this was painted by someone famous. Maybe it's valuable."
Lisa,She is?
Lisa,This is so exciting! My first time establishing provenance!
Lisa,That's a terrible thing for a father to do.
Lisa,Hmm... this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy.
Lisa,Yes we do. It's a Johan Oldenveldt.
Lisa,What?
Lisa,You're a... forger?
Lisa,What you do is horrible: ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles.
Lisa,What!?
Lisa,"Well... no, but now when I look at it all I'll see is a fraud."
Lisa,"But, you still, I mean... I suppose you're right."
Lisa,"Madame Curie, we just might have this one in the bag."
Lisa,"Okay, calm down. Maybe he's talking about Margaret Mead."
Lisa,No-no-no.
Lisa,Martin took my topic. What do I do?
Lisa,Everyone does that.
Lisa,"Okay, Dad's my hero. Why is he my hero?"
Lisa,Near tears.
Lisa,No!
Lisa,My hero isn't famous...
Lisa,...isn't rich...
Lisa,...and isn't in any history books...
Lisa,He's my Dad.
Lisa,He worked two jobs to get me a pony... he started me playing the saxophone you all love...
Lisa,"...and anyone can put a band aid on, but my Dad knows how to take it off so it doesn't hurt."
Lisa,"...And when my Dad was a soccer referee, he had the guts to red card me, his only talking daughter, because he knew I was diving."
Lisa,"In the history of soccer, he's the only parent to ever take sides against his own kid, and he was right. He made me a better person, because that's what heroes do."
Lisa,That's what heroes do.
Lisa,"Hey, Dad."
Lisa,"Oh, dad, you don't want details. No one wants to see the sausage being made."
Lisa,"Dad, they're offering us an all-expenses paid trip to the greatest sporting event on earth!"
Lisa,"I switched with her, Dad."
Lisa,How'd you eat the meat without the vegetables?
Lisa,"Don't do it, Dad. Don't cheat."
Lisa,I'm sorry you weren't my first choice. In fact... I had my doubts about using you at all.
Lisa,You put it on the fridge!
Lisa,"All right, you're hurt. I understand. But when I made you my hero, you lived up to it and more. You became the hero I thought you could be, Dad."
Lisa,"No penalty! He dove, Dad!"
Lisa,"I don't know, but she's my new hero."
Lisa,"Wow, the Amazon is just like I pictured it after seeing all those pictures online."
Lisa,At least we hope it's bottom.
Lisa,Are you okay?
Lisa,Don't put more in there!
Lisa,What record? Stupidest death?
Lisa,"Oh, well, you're very wel--"
Lisa,"Actually, I think it--"
Lisa,What does a competitive eater eat?
Lisa,What does that mean?
Lisa,Is Kobayashi the number one... um... uh...
Lisa,I won't be using the correct term then.
Lisa,"Um, why don't I just go sit alone and-- Oh, you're doing it."
Lisa,Maybe this isn't the sport for you.
Lisa,Can I join you for lunch?
Lisa,"Um, can I just have a slice?"
Lisa,"Beans, beans. We'll do beans."
Lisa,Maybe you're not cut out for competitive eating.
Lisa,"No, I'm just, I... maybe you just haven't found the right food. Huh? How 'bout ice cream?"
Lisa,Hello?
Lisa,Dad? Did you just call?
Lisa,Just the two of us?
Lisa,I'd love that. See you tonight!
Lisa,"So, Mr. Burns never realized it was Maggie who saved the plant?"
Lisa,I'm fine.
Lisa,Is that Mom?
Lisa,"Dad, I believe we were on a date."
Lisa,Lucas! You're not competitive eating anymore?
Lisa,"Well, that's a relief."
Lisa,What if I just taught you how to whistle?
Lisa,"Oh Dad, you're back! Just in time for my recital!"
Lisa,Wha--?!
Lisa,Hooray.
Lisa,"See ya, Homer! / Bye, Dad!"
Lisa,Typical Ralph nonsense.
Lisa,Now that's what I call a modern family.
Lisa,Can I make an observation?
Lisa,I'm okay with no friends. It's easier to focus and it'll give me great material for whatever art form I choose. Right now I'm thinking long novella. Goodnight!
Lisa,After this we'll do makeovers!
Lisa,Gus Huebner? Is that you?
Lisa,Are you guys okay?
Lisa,What's for dinner?
Lisa,Tumi? But you're from the other second grade. We only come together for tornado drills.
Lisa,"Yeah, it kind of was. But I won't push it, I promise. See ya!"
Lisa,The vintage record store?
Lisa,"At the risk of sounding like a broken record, yes, yes, yes!"
Lisa,"It's so much fun to finally have a friend who likes the NPR show ""Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me"" as much as I do."
Lisa,Want some more smoothie?
Lisa,What do you want?
Lisa,What's the advice?
Lisa,"Oh God, I'm gonna be sick!"
Lisa,Mom paid her to be my friend?
Lisa,You don't want to be here.
Lisa,Neither do you!
Lisa,"Mom, how could you pay someone to be my friend?!"
Lisa,Answer me!
Lisa,I would've found a friend eventually. You couldn't wait a damn decade until I got into college?
Lisa,I'm gonna tell every psychiatrist I ever go to what you did.
Lisa,"Mom, stop! Stop! Stop! I'm sorry!"
Lisa,Please stop!
Lisa,"I'm fine. Fine! It's funny, but... hurting your feelings made me feel better."
Lisa,"But when I grow up, I'll find other weird kids and we will have the most intense relationships ever. And I'll always love you."
Lisa,Happy Mother's Day.
Lisa,"Great! But from now on, we have to be totally honest with each other."
Lisa,"Our Lord, Buddha, says the secret of existence is to pass beyond fear."
Lisa,"My brother is about to meet fear, and as usual, he won't pass."
Lisa,The last day of school. Field Day. WhEN you learn to balance an egg on a spoon...
Lisa,And run with your leg tied to someone who wouldn't talk to you all year.
Lisa,Hey! Are you coming to the afterschool pool party?
Lisa,"Bart faced a terrible choice: take a beating with his friend or slither off like a coward. And like he did with every multiple choice question he ever saw, Bart chose ""B."""
Lisa,Bart won a blue ribbon... but was it worth it?
Lisa,Mom! I'm narrating!
Lisa,Fine.
Lisa,"As the pin on the back of the blue ribbon made its way through Bart's shirt and into its housing, the seeds of his comeuppance flew out of the woods."
Lisa,"While Bart was being outwitted by a baby, something was coming to a boil in our Pop's brainpan."
Lisa,Fourth of July fireworks were a different story. They meant more to my Dad than my Mom could ever know.
Lisa,It was the one night of every year that he never heard his parents argue. He figured it was because they loved the fireworks just as much as he did.
Lisa,"With his mom gone, Homer needed a hero. And no one was a bigger hero than the magical little man behind the controls."
Lisa,"Bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie, and that's exactly what he did."
Lisa,"So Bart was revealed as a coward, and now it seemed like the whole world was against him."
Lisa,"While Bart was in Hell, Homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone."
Lisa,"So Milhouse got the redemption he deserved... and so, in a way, did Bart."
Lisa,"Which meant that at long last, my brother could get a good night's sleep."
Lisa,"Three feet, nine inches. That should do it."
Lisa,"Okay, enough theory."
Lisa,Krusty's getting roasted tonight.
Lisa,"If you don't let us watch, we'll just go to a house where some more permissive parents will."
Lisa,"Dad, are you okay?"
Lisa,"Dad, you're eating too much! I'm worried about your health! I don't wanna lose you!"
Lisa,Oh no.
Lisa,Mom? Dad?
Lisa,"I've been listening, and Dad stops breathing for as long as five minutes. Mind if I sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him?"
Lisa,"Wrapping you in bubble wrap. I can't always be around to protect you, so it will."
Lisa,I guess you're right.
Lisa,That's all I wanted: a tiny bit of control.
Lisa,"I know, but they're not gonna waste a whole Saturday inside."
Lisa,I've got an idea... but I'll need that broccoli.
Lisa,"These two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same. One of them, however, has the broccoli blended in."
Lisa,"Bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't. No one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end."
Lisa,"Mom, it's trash talk. You know how guys say mean things to their friends, the way women say nice things to their enemies."
Lisa,She's under a lot of stress. Her husband's at sea.
Lisa,"Dad, dogs don't know when to stop eating."
Lisa,"Hey mom, can you pack me a dozen sandwiches in my lunch tomorrow? Meat, no meat, it's all good."
Lisa,"No, whenever anything bothers me I harmlessly vent it to Maggie."
Lisa,Kids love 'em. We trade them at school.
Lisa,"Wow, Mom! You're gonna open a sandwich store?!"
Lisa,What's wrong?
Lisa,"This is so sad. In his homeland, Dad was a nuclear engineer."
Lisa,"No, no. You want to make American kids work?"
Lisa,"Um, I'm not sure this is the best use of my skills."
Lisa,One jumbo Joe to go!
Lisa,One Florence Nightingale in a box and make it snappy!
Lisa,Really Bart?
Lisa,"Hm, looks like ancient Aramaic. Fortunately, I have an app for that."
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,Docetism?
Lisa,Making fun of someone's clothes. How original.
Lisa,It's true! It would be a cold day in Hell when I was popular.
Lisa,Bart! I found a portal back to Earth.
Lisa,No! No! No! No! That's Super Hell!
Lisa,"Dad, the TV's screwed up. It only plays ""Married... With Children."""
Lisa,This house is haunted!
Lisa,"Noble spirits, your time has passed."
Lisa,That was unmotivated.
Lisa,Shut up!
Lisa,"Well, I guess you and I are in charge now, Bart. But if we split the chores, I'm sure we can... what are you doing?!"
Lisa,Oh no! You're not leaving me to clean this up!
Lisa,Flaming tap water. I saw something about that in a documentary...
Lisa,"Sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, cute! This one..."
Lisa,Maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue.
Lisa,This is clearly a fracking site. How are they keeping people away?
Lisa,It's a terrific sport that--
Lisa,This whole building is just a façade for a drilling operation.
Lisa,"Stopping Mr. Burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on ""Beezus and Ramona."" But I know someone who can help..."
Lisa,The first female speaker of the state assembly...
Lisa,A politician who would never ignore a fellow environmentalist in need... my hero...
Lisa,Maxine Lombard.
Lisa,Assemblywoman Lombard! You got my emails!
Lisa,How could you sell fracking for Mr. Burns?
Lisa,I am judging you.
Lisa,Judge-judge-judge--
Lisa,WHAT!?!?
Lisa,Y-e-e-e-s.
Lisa,Probably just another piece of America's space junk falling out of orbit.
Lisa,"You know, they look a little similar."
Lisa,A little lazy if you ask me.
Lisa,"Regardless, I see no reason to believe that ""Bender"" is from the future. Robotic technology today is very advanced."
Lisa,It's not my birthday. Although Maggie's is pretty soon.
Lisa,This is the robot who claims to be from the future.
Lisa,"What stopped you, Bender? Asimov's three laws of robotics?"
Lisa,"Wait, stop! Why must you kill my Dad? Especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you?"
Lisa,"Professor Farnsworth, I'm dying to know how you got here. Was it a time machine?"
Lisa,That's it! All we have to do is dig up the time capsule!
Lisa,But you just said that--
Lisa,What a surprise -- it's Bart.
Lisa,I can't believe you're all giving up without a fight.
Lisa,"Let me take care of that. If there's one thing I know how to do, it's manipulate Barts."
Lisa,"Dad, we have beer in our time!"
Lisa,Attention Goblins: Madison Cube Garden is filled with Butterfinger bars. And people are laying fingers all over them.
Lisa,"They're evolving! Wow. That's a first for you, Bart."
Lisa,"Wait, wait, wait! You're the portal. How are you going to get to the future?"
Lisa,Why are you wearing your hat at dinner?
Lisa,We're sorry.
Lisa,"Excuse me, but Buzzard's Roost is a converted parking lot."
Lisa,Parking lot.
Lisa,Parking lot.
Lisa,Hello? Hello? Is everything okay?
Lisa,"Excuse me, you ruined my report."
Lisa,Oh! Yippee! Fourth-grade A!
Lisa,Gosh... that was a hard sleeping bag to roll up.
Lisa,A world of anarchic free expression!
Lisa,I'm home!
Lisa,So many musical choices!
Lisa,"A brass band... barbershop quintet?... the human kazoo... ooh, a drum circle!"
Lisa,"Oh no! King Toot's is closed! Dad, you're gonna have to take me to the... big box music store."
Lisa,Look at all these monstrosities.
Lisa,(IMPRESSED NOISE
Lisa,It's so cool to have another musician in the family!
Lisa,"Uh, well to truly master an instrument you'll need years of--"
Lisa,"Yeah, you really get that it's all about the music."
Lisa,"Dad, you shouldn't be jealous of Apu. Remember, it's all about the music."
Lisa,"Wow, he's right."
Lisa,"Mom, where's Dad?"
Lisa,"Well, the story of jazz starts with the tresillo, the most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-Saharan African music, but the rest will have to wait. Bart, Bart, I hear Mom sobbing and I don't know where Dad is!"
Lisa,Bart! This is the year I've got to nail Christmas. I don't want to be a jaded ten-year-old like you!
Lisa,"Mom, I'm just a kid. But I say if Dad isn't here Christmas morning, that's the kind of thing families never recover from."
Lisa,I'm afraid we've awoken a needy giant.
Lisa,Bart! You know you can't open a present till Mom and Dad wake up!
Lisa,Oops. So did mine.
Lisa,I got a chemistry set!
Lisa,Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Lisa,Are we there yet?
Lisa,Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Lisa,Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Lisa,Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Lisa,Are we there yet?
Lisa,This is us.
Lisa,Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Lisa,"Whoa, this place sure has changed since Dizznee bought the rights to Cosmic Wars."
Lisa,They revamped this ride because of massive complaints from two people.
Lisa,We have been here six hours and the coolest thing we've done is stand in the Cool Zone.
Lisa,"Dad, I don't know about this. It's not on the park map."
Lisa,We've left Earth's atmosphere!
Lisa,Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Lisa,Are we there yet?
Lisa,"Are we truly in space? And if so, why?"
Lisa,Why does the last thing you say sound so ominous?
Lisa,You mean like Europeans were to the Native Americans? Or the Belgians were to the Congo?
Lisa,Now what?
Lisa,Are there any side effects?
Lisa,"So, you use a lot of solar energy?"
Lisa,Why are you sharing all of this with us?
Lisa,Right hand red!
Lisa,"I win, I think."
Lisa,Thanks.
Lisa,I thought it was a ball!
Lisa,Here you go.
Lisa,"Now do you see why I'm a vegetarian, Dad?"
Lisa,It's called a knot.
Lisa,Knot with a K.
Lisa,That's correct.
Lisa,This system is really rigged against us.
Lisa,"Um, are you sure you don't want to try me again?"
Lisa,Really? But I thought...
Lisa,Right. Conquering.
Lisa,"Well, I guess we've learned that of all the countless planets in the universe, we have evolved into the most inedible species. Like three bean salad at a barbecue, we will remain untouched."
Lisa,I thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table.
Lisa,I knew he wasn't gonna like the stack parking.
Lisa,"You know, Dad, studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient."
Lisa,I just wanted to see him cluck like a chicken.
Lisa,"Mom, Dad's been hypnotized to think he was ten!"
Lisa,So... where is he gonna sleep?
Lisa,I'm done.
Lisa,Not right now.
Lisa,"Listen, Homer. I just want to take advantage of this opportunity to have you enjoy my saxophone with me."
Lisa,"I've been emotionally dealing with that all week. So, yes."
Lisa,"Look, Dad had to get cured some time. There's nothing we can do about it."
Lisa,Whoa! Looks like our bird house is benefitting from positive word of beak.
Lisa,A bald eagle!
Lisa,No! Let's take the eagle to Shelbyville Animal Rescue. Where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.
Lisa,"Or, maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild."
Lisa,Dad no! Elon Musk is possibly the greatest living inventor!
Lisa,His company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents! He changed the way Hollywood drives!
Lisa,"That's so sad. Maybe we're the same, two lost ships in the intellectual sea, each of whom could inspire the other to..."
Lisa,"Hi, I didn't want to miss one more chance to spend time with Mr. Musk. It is such an honor."
Lisa,He is. And may I save that paper?
Lisa,"No ideas? Oh, that's sad."
Lisa,That's even worse!
Lisa,"He's taking your Homer-isms and turning them into his own great ideas! This is the most inspirational moment of my life, but, unfortunately, this is my stop."
Lisa,Bye!
Lisa,"Bart, what are you doing?"
Lisa,Foolish boy. You'll never guess Elon Musk's master password.
Lisa,I just wanted to see if there was a better life. Even for a little bit.
Lisa,"Mr. Musk, before you go, is there anything you could do to give a little girl hope that the world of the future won't be as grim as all our current movies forecast?"
Lisa,I guess humanity wants its change one birdhouse at a time.
Lisa,"Hm. For a man who likes electric cars, he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel."
Lisa,"What's wrong, Dad?"
Lisa,"I still believe in this town... a town that deserves its own original song! And as an aspiring musician with off-Broadway dreams, I'm the one to write it!"
Lisa,"Let's see... What rhymes with ""Jebediah""?"
Lisa,"How about ""Patty and Selma""?"
Lisa,Mr. Teeny?
Lisa,You've got a gift!
Lisa,"Yeah, with that mental patient who thought he was Michael Jackson."
Lisa,"Bart, I need your help to write a new anthem for Springfield. Will you team up with me?"
Lisa,"Uh, I'll make brownies later."
Lisa,I think we might just make a good team. Like Maggie and Grampa.
Lisa,We did it! We wrote an awesome song!
Lisa,Should we hug?
Lisa,That works.
Lisa,"BUT TO BE FRANK, THERE'S NOT A LOT TO RECOMMEND IT..."
Lisa,WE'VE GOT A BIG SINKHOLE...
Lisa,"HASHTAG ""SPRINGFIELD PRIDE"" HAS NEVER EVER TREND-ED."
Lisa,BUT WHEN YOU THINK OF THE THINGS WE LACK...
Lisa,"Mom, what's wrong?"
Lisa,Do you really think that we can write a song that does that?
Lisa,"Well, it would've helped if you hadn't crumpled up all the paper before we wrote anything on it."
Lisa,"Take it, Bart!"
Lisa,I gave it to you!
Lisa,"We couldn't write a song. We're one-hit wonders! But, is that such a crime? Look at J.D. Salinger."
Lisa,Rubik's Cube!
Lisa,Charles M. Schulz.
Lisa,"Well you're the only ""gangsta"" I know with a nine o'clock bedtime!"
Lisa,"Ooh, Mom. Someone wants you to give them a ride."
Lisa,"Well, despite all that, today's gonna be fun, Dad! Will there be lots of other girls there?"
Lisa,Is it called the cooling tower because there's--
Lisa,"Dad, do you have anything I can eat?"
Lisa,"Wow, Dad! Thank you!"
Lisa,Eight.
Lisa,You're talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz.
Lisa,You never let me tell!
Lisa,What percentage of prayers really come true?
Lisa,--but she hasn't come home yet and we're worried she's in trouble!
Lisa,I'm telling mom about how the school freezer broke and they had to cook all the tater tots and the teachers took the extra tots home in manila envelopes!
Lisa,Cook all the tater tots! / There were too many tots! / And the teachers took them home in manila envelopes! / I hate you!
Lisa,I can't believe you're gambling.
Lisa,I know how much to tip a waiter.
Lisa,Mom's counting cards at the casino!
Lisa,"But I really want a pony and I've been really, really good this year."
Lisa,"Nice try, Dad."
Lisa,Ooh.
Lisa,I do!
Lisa,But Mom had to spend all the Christmas money having it surgically removed.
Lisa,Daddy! We're so glad to see you!
Lisa,"Can we go too, Dad?"
Lisa,"Way to go, Dad."
Lisa,"Oh, no!"
Lisa,Yay!
Lisa,"What, Aunt Patty?"
Lisa,"Well I wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have. Therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me. And I am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts."
Lisa,"A dog! All right, Dad!"
Lisa,So love at first sight is possible.
Lisa,What's his name?
Lisa,RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER / HAD A VERY SHINY NOSE / AND IF YOU EVER SAW IT / YOU WOULD EVEN SAY IT GLOWED
Lisa,ALL OF THE OTHER REINDEER / USED TO LAUGH AND CALL HIM NAMES...
Lisa,Like Shine-ola!
Lisa,THEY NEVER LET POOR RUDOLPH / JOIN IN ANY REINDEER GAMES...
Lisa,THEN ONE FOGGY CHRISTMAS EVE / SANTA CAME TO SAY...
Lisa,THEN ALL THE REINDEER LOVED HIM / AS THEY SHOUTED OUT WITH GLEE / RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER / YOU'LL GO DOWN IN HISTORY...
Lisa,"Yeah, Mom, hurry up."
Lisa,Nurturing.
Lisa,Id. Triple word score.
Lisa,"Not I.D., Dad. Id. It's a word."
Lisa,"Yeah, Bart. You're supposed to be developing verbal abilities for your big aptitude test tomorrow."
Lisa,"""Id. Along with the ego and the superego, one of three components of the psyche."""
Lisa,"I don't care what that stupid test says, Bart. You're a dimwit."
Lisa,He's the bullfighter.
Lisa,"Hey, lookin' good, Bart."
Lisa,"I think Bart's stupid again, Mom."
Lisa,Here's a good job at the fireworks factory.
Lisa,How 'bout this: Supervising Technician at the toxic waste dump.
Lisa,"Yeah, Dad. You can do it!"
Lisa,"Dad, eat something. It's got mustard on it."
Lisa,I don't know what else to do.
Lisa,We've been robbed!
Lisa,Look what I found.
Lisa,Yeah!
Lisa,"All right, Dad!"
Lisa,"What, Dad?"
Lisa,Wow!
Lisa,Yeah!
Lisa,Yeah!
Lisa,"Go, Dad!"
Lisa,Yeah!
Lisa,Aha!
Lisa,We were fighting over which one of us loves you more.
Lisa,"No, you do!"
Lisa,"Yes, you do!"
Lisa,Tough choice.
Lisa,"Hey Bart, last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!"
Lisa,Me first!
Lisa,"No, me!"
Lisa,Me!
Lisa,This is where you belong.
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,"Happy, Dad?"
Lisa,Good. Commence shovelling.
Lisa,Amen. Let's eat.
Lisa,The sad truth is all families are like us.
Lisa,The dad has a shirt on.
Lisa,What are they doing?
Lisa,Where's he going?
Lisa,You're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro wrestling?
Lisa,Why can't we have a meeting when you're watching TV?
Lisa,Hey!
Lisa,I guess I'd have needed a partial scholarship.
Lisa,"No, Dad! Please don't pawn the TV!"
Lisa,There go my young-girl dreams of Vassar.
Lisa,We would if we had one.
Lisa,Ogre is such a strong word.
Lisa,Arrrgh!
Lisa,So did mine.
Lisa,Arrrgh!
Lisa,Arrrgh!
Lisa,Arrrgh!
Lisa,It's not the money as much as the feeling that we earned it.
Lisa,Keep your greasy mitts outta there.
Lisa,It's Mrs. Hoover's birthday!
Lisa,No there aren't.
Lisa,"I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad. I like my teacher."
Lisa,"Dad, I get good grades 'cause I'm smart and I pay attention and I study hard."
Lisa,"Oh, brother."
Lisa,"Here, Otto, I made an extra one for you."
Lisa,You're welcome.
Lisa,Forget it.
Lisa,Tell me more.
Lisa,"You'll never get one now, Mr. Name-caller."
Lisa,"You weren't thinking, were you?"
Lisa,"I'm not a sniveling toad, am I?"
Lisa,"I'm not a little egg sucker, am I?"
Lisa,Then what am I?
Lisa,What do you like best about me?
Lisa,Well... hm...
Lisa,"Open your mouth, and close your eyes, and you will get a big surprise."
Lisa,"Look, Janey, cupcakes."
Lisa,Hey! Give those back!
Lisa,Don't Bart! He's a friend of Nelson Muntz.
Lisa,"Does, too."
Lisa,"Hey, everybody. Here comes my brother, Bart the bully­ killer!"
Lisa,"Bart, here's that cupcake you wanted. I can't help but think if I had just given it to you in the first place, this whole horrible tragedy could have been avoided. I know you can't eat it now, so I'll just place it lovingly on your forehead. ."
Lisa,"Bart, you can't go on like this."
Lisa,Why don't you go see Grampa?
Lisa,He'll give you good advice. He's the toughest Simpson alive.
Lisa,"Yeah, remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home?"
Lisa,Eww! Knock it off!
Lisa,"But, Mr. Largo, that's what my country's all about."
Lisa,"Oh, Dad..."
Lisa,Here.
Lisa,Just take mine. A simple cupcake will bring me no pleasure.
Lisa,"I'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of its car. The Iowa farmer whose land has been taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats. The West Virginia coal miner, coughing up his..."
Lisa,"Every day at noon a bell rings and they herd us in here for feeding time. And we sit around like cattle, chewing our cuds, dreading the inevitable..."
Lisa,I choose not to participate.
Lisa,"In other words, to dodge the ball."
Lisa,I'm too sad.
Lisa,"It's not that kind of sad. I'm sorry, Dad, but you wouldn't understand."
Lisa,"I'm just wondering, what's the point? Would it make any difference at all if I never existed? How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?"
Lisa,"Sorry, Dad. I know you mean well."
Lisa,No. Not really.
Lisa,So typical of Bart. All he thinks about is himself.
Lisa,Is not.
Lisa,Is not.
Lisa,Is not.
Lisa,"No, Maggie! Come here, girl. Come to me."
Lisa,"No, Maggie, don't go for the glitter. Look for substance."
Lisa,"All right Maggie, just go to Bart."
Lisa,I was just playing the blues... ...Dad.
Lisa,"No, that's okay, Dad. I'll just work on my fingering. Unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you."
Lisa,I've got to find that sound.
Lisa,That was beautiful. What's it called?
Lisa,"Thanks, Mr. Murphy."
Lisa,Ew! How'd you get a name like that?
Lisa,Yeah.
Lisa,"I have problems, too."
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,"""I got a bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, she gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo / I'm the sa...dest kid in grade number two."""
Lisa,"Yeah, but I don't feel any better."
Lisa,"But Mom, can't I... stay a little longer?"
Lisa,I don't want your pity.
Lisa,How?
Lisa,But I don't feel like smiling.
Lisa,I feel more popular already.
Lisa,Thanks.
Lisa,Not me.
Lisa,Uh-huh.
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,"No, sir."
Lisa,"Wow, Mom."
Lisa,"Okay, Mom."
Lisa,I feel like smiling.
Lisa,This is better than our house!
Lisa,No.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"We're playing ""What's that odor?""."
Lisa,"You win, Bart."
Lisa,"Mom, I'm scared."
Lisa,Yes!!!
Lisa,Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
Lisa,The Simpsons have entered the forest.
Lisa,"Look, Maggie! Birdies!"
Lisa,You are?
Lisa,"Remember, Dad. The handle of the Big Dipper points to the North Star."
Lisa,"Should Maggie be going with them, Mom?"
Lisa,I hope Maggie and the boys are all right.
Lisa,"Yeah, I suppose so. Night Mom."
Lisa,"Ready for inspection, Mom."
Lisa,"What about my cat, Snowball?"
Lisa,The answers to deep theological questions..
Lisa,Valhalla is where Vikings go when they die.
Lisa,I think she likes my present better.
Lisa,It's a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it.
Lisa,It's so awful.
Lisa,"Hey Bart, where you going?"
Lisa,"Why don't you watch ""Krusty The Clown""?"
Lisa,This is gonna be the best birthday breakfast Mom ever had.
Lisa,Maybe one more.
Lisa,I hope she likes the presents we got her.
Lisa,"Well, I think she's gonna like my hand-made birthday card better."
Lisa,Happy birthday!
Lisa,Here's your birthday breakfast!
Lisa,No!
Lisa,"Yeah, what'd you get?"
Lisa,"I think he forgot, Mom."
Lisa,"Does, too."
Lisa,Then how comes she's not putting on any of your perfume?
Lisa,"Oh, brother."
Lisa,"Don't be scared, Dad. It's not so hard taking care of us."
Lisa,Mm! Delicioso!
Lisa,"""LULLABY AND GOOD NIGHT / GO TO BED AND SLEEP TIGHT / CLOSE YOUR EYES, START TO YAWN / PLEASANT DREAMS UNTIL THE DAWN."""
Lisa,"Are you going bowling again tonight, Mom?"
Lisa,"Oh, Bart, don't you see? This is what psychologists call over-compensation. Mom is racked with guilt because her marriage is failing."
Lisa,"Bart, I read about what happens to kids whose parents no longer love and cherish each other. They go through eight separate stages. Right now, I'm in Stage Three, fear. You're in Stage Two, denial."
Lisa,"Yes, you are."
Lisa,"Yes, you are."
Lisa,I stand corrected.
Lisa,"Frightened, Bart? Welcome to Stage Three: Fear."
Lisa,"Sorry, Bart. I'd love to help you but I'm mired in Stage Five, self-pity."
Lisa,"Female carrier, Bart."
Lisa,"Ewww, gross."
Lisa,"Mom, Bart was taking a picture of his butt."
Lisa,Yay! Fried shrimp!
Lisa,Ewwwww!
Lisa,"Yeah. Eat it, Bart."
Lisa,I wonder when Dad's coming home?
Lisa,"Hi, Daddy."
Lisa,Still kinda ticked off.
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,What do you know about France?
Lisa,"'Bye, Bart."
Lisa,"You know, in Albania the unit of currency is called the lek."
Lisa,And the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field.
Lisa,And the main export is furious political thought.
Lisa,I'm defending a country where people can think and act and worship any way they want.
Lisa,"Can, too."
Lisa,"Can, too."
Lisa,"Well, okay."
Lisa,Your paper-thin commitment to your children sends shivers down my spine. May I be excused?
Lisa,"Hi, Sideshow Bob."
Lisa,Goodbye Adil. Have a nice trip.
Lisa,"Look, Mom. There he is."
Lisa,He brought us gifts. His first unselfish act.
Lisa,"Bart, I have something to say that's gonna bother me if I don't say it... It's good to see you."
Lisa,With all our hearts!
Lisa,We'd kill ourselves!
Lisa,The cannon. The cannon. The cannon. The cannon.
Lisa,I didn't do it!
Lisa,"If cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time."
Lisa,Oh no!
Lisa,His face is so flesh-colored and sad.
Lisa,"I'm watching Sideshow Bob. You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Krusty used to be."
Lisa,"Snap out of it, Bart. Face the facts. All those hours we spent staring at Krusty, we were staring at a crook."
Lisa,"Oh, Bart."
Lisa,You do? Why?
Lisa,"No, why?"
Lisa,Yeah man.
Lisa,"Bart, look!"
Lisa,"Come on, Bart. The tape showed that the robber heated up a burrito."
Lisa,"Don't you remember the get-well card we sent to Krusty? It was after his heart attack, when he had a pacemaker put in."
Lisa,Wait a minute. Krusty can't read.
Lisa,"No! Don't you get it, Bart? How could Krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read?"
Lisa,"Bart, I'm starting to think you're right. Krusty was framed. Did he have any enemies?"
Lisa,Sideshow Bob!
Lisa,"Come on, Bart. Go with the flow."
Lisa,With all our hearts!
Lisa,"Bart, there's one left and it's mine!"
Lisa,"Awww, Dad."
Lisa,"Uh-oh, school bus."
Lisa,We got money!
Lisa,"Oh, come on, Bart, not again."
Lisa,"Wow, a quarter past six. What's keeping Dad?"
Lisa,"Hey, Mom."
Lisa,"Mom, you look so glamorous."
Lisa,Dad dances?
Lisa,"Oh, boy, ""The Happy Little Elves Meet The Curious Bear Cub""!"
Lisa,But I want to see what happens.
Lisa,"Oh, no!"
Lisa,"Bart, you're just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love."
Lisa,"Oh, no, Bart, we'll have nightmares."
Lisa,Botz.
Lisa,"One eight hundred you snitch, no, you... squeal..."
Lisa,"Come on, come on."
Lisa,Finally!
Lisa,I'm calling to report the Babysitter Bandit. She's in our house right --
Lisa,He isn't.
Lisa,"Quiet, Bart. Let's make the best of this."
Lisa,"Maggie, Maggie."
Lisa,"Maggie, wanna watch ""The Happy Little Elves"" again?"
Lisa,"Okay, but you have to untie me first."
Lisa,We caught her! We caught the Babysitter Bandit! She's tied up at our house right now!
Lisa,"Is there a reward? If she's convicted, we get T-shirts."
Lisa,"He doesn't care, Mom."
Lisa,"Well, okay. I got an A on my vocabulary test."
Lisa,"Everyone knows you're faking it, Bart."
Lisa,You're gonna have to fail that history test sooner or later.
Lisa,"Prayer, the last refuge of a scoundrel."
Lisa,"I heard you last night, Bart. You prayed for this. Now your prayers have been answered. I'm no theologian. I don't know who or what God is exactly. All I know is He's a force more powerful than Mom and Dad put together and you owe him big."
Lisa,An absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
Lisa,Okay.
Lisa,Dad is taking this in a less than heroic fashion.
Lisa,"... and the policeman on the other end of the phone said, ""We have traced the call. It's coming from the floor below you. Get out of the house!"" But it was too late. End of story."
Lisa,Is too.
Lisa,Is too.
Lisa,Is too.
Lisa,Fine. Then you tell one scarier.
Lisa,"Oh, brother."
Lisa,Ow! Mom! Bart threw a book at me.
Lisa,Did too.
Lisa,Did too.
Lisa,It looks like a vortex -- a gateway into another dimension.
Lisa,Quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.
Lisa,I can feel an evil presence in this house.
Lisa,"Sorry... Sorry Bart. sorry, mom... sorry Maggie... sorry Lisa."
Lisa,That's okay.
Lisa,Mom! Dad! Look!
Lisa,It's an ancient Indian burial ground.
Lisa,Why are you trying to scare us? Are you trying to keep us from getting close to you... maybe even loving you?
Lisa,It chose to destroy itself rather than live with us. You can't help but feel a little rejected.
Lisa,"That wasn't scary at all, Bart."
Lisa,Heh... heh... heh.
Lisa,"Look, I know that to you we Simpsons are a lower order of life. We face that prejudice every day of our lives, but we are happy on our little planet. We throw ourselves on your mercy. Please return us to..."
Lisa,Fried shrimp.
Lisa,There's something not quite right about this.
Lisa,"Hey, how come we never see you guys eat?"
Lisa,Stop!
Lisa,Don't you see what's happening here? They're fattening us up so they can eat us.
Lisa,"If you don't believe me, look at this book I found."
Lisa,Wait a minute!
Lisa,"Well, why were you trying to make us eat all the time?"
Lisa,There were monsters on that ship. And truly we were them.
Lisa,"For your information, I'm about to read you a classic tale of terror by Edgar Allan Poe."
Lisa,"Don't worry, Bart. You won't learn anything."
Lisa,"It's called, ""The Raven."""
Lisa,"Once upon a midnight dreary,"
Lisa,"while I pondered, weak and weary,"
Lisa,"Bart, he's establishing mood."
Lisa,What?
Lisa,"Bart! Stop it. He says ""nevermore"". That's all he'll ever say."
Lisa,"Well, it was written in 1845. Maybe people were easier to scare back then."
Lisa,"Not yet, sir."
Lisa,"My brother's using worms but I who feel that tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing."
Lisa,"Try not to spill anything, Dad."
Lisa,"Oooo, a political discussion at our table. I feel like a Kennedy."
Lisa,"""Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?"""
Lisa,"Hmmm. Well as long as I'm asking something, can I ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable?"
Lisa,"Yes, sir. A very inane one. Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?"
Lisa,"Oh Mom, that felt awful."
Lisa,"But Mom, we've become the tools of evil."
Lisa,"Mr. Burns, I hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish."
Lisa,"I can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard. There's just the green grass of the outfield, the crushed brick of the infield, and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy."
Lisa,"Yeah, you throw like me."
Lisa,We want a catcher / Not a belly scratcher!
Lisa,Our lives have taken an odd turn.
Lisa,I can't leave Springfield. I was born here and I thought I would die here.
Lisa,"But, Dad. We're simple people with simple values. Capital City is too big and too complex. Everyone in Springfield knows us and has forgiven us."
Lisa,Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
Lisa,"I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, my leaving would actually have meant something."
Lisa,The Pennyloafer!
Lisa,Capital City -- yeah!
Lisa,There he is!
Lisa,"Mom, what's he doing wrong?"
Lisa,But I can't go back! Not after I've seen the bright lights of Capital City. I'll wither and die like a hothouse flower.
Lisa,"Read the bosom part again, Dad."
Lisa,"And I'm studying for the Math Fair. If I win, I'll bring home a brand new protractor."
Lisa,"Hi, Bart. What're you doing?"
Lisa,"Well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but I think you're referring to a pawn."
Lisa,"I know. It's times like this that I'm thankful Dad has little to no interest in almost everything I do. Bart, I think I can help you."
Lisa,Our journey begins here at the library.
Lisa,"Hi, Mrs. Norton."
Lisa,"Hi, Ralph."
Lisa,"Hey, gang. Okay, Bart, this is the card catalog."
Lisa,"Let's see, ""golf""... Anecdotes, Eisenhower and, Fashion, Humor, Japanese Obsession With... ah, here it is. Putting."
Lisa,"And, finally, the most important book of all, The Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu."
Lisa,"Bart, we're just gonna borrow them."
Lisa,I want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.
Lisa,Embrace nothingness.
Lisa,Become like an uncarved stone.
Lisa,Bart! You're just pretending to know what I'm talking about.
Lisa,"Well, it's very frustrating."
Lisa,"Bart, I have a riddle for you: What's the sound of one hand clapping?"
Lisa,"No, Bart. It's a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer. It's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought."
Lisa,"Let's try another one: If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?"
Lisa,"But Bart, how can a sound exist if there's no one there to hear it?"
Lisa,It is time.
Lisa,The basis of this game seems to be simple geometry. All you have to do is hit the ball here.
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,Dad!
Lisa,Eighth hole.
Lisa,Twelfth hole.
Lisa,Nirvana.
Lisa,"Mom, Bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates. Steak will make him logy."
Lisa,Oatmeal.
Lisa,Oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the Kentucky Derby.
Lisa,"Bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself, I'm not sure how they're supposed to sound. But here goes. I believe in you."
Lisa,Why do I get the feeling that someday I'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?
Lisa,"Bart, cut it out!"
Lisa,"It's not yours, Bart! This is family glue!"
Lisa,"Dad, this isn't about glue. It's about territoriality. He only wants the glue because I'm using it."
Lisa,Here.
Lisa,"Maggie, I'm about to unveil my centerpiece to the family!"
Lisa,"It's a tribute to the trailblazing women who made our country great... See, there's Georgia O'Keefe... Susan B. Anthony... and this is Marjorie Stoneman Douglas. I'm sure you haven't heard of her, but she worked her whole life to preserve the Florida Everglades."
Lisa,"As one of the Simpson women, would you like to contribute something to it?"
Lisa,"Oh, thank you."
Lisa,"I couldn't tell you how many hours. It was a labor of love. It's my homage to some American heroes who may not have fought in any wars, but who nevertheless..."
Lisa,"It's the centerpiece, Bart!"
Lisa,"Hey, Bart, stop it!"
Lisa,Mom!
Lisa,Baaart! You're wrecking it! LET GO! I worked forever on this!
Lisa,BAAARRTT!
Lisa,You don't even care! You don't even care!
Lisa,That's all right.
Lisa,"Mom, I poured my heart into that centerpiece! Things like that always happen in this family!"
Lisa,I saw the best meals of my generation destroyed by the madness of my brother / My soul carved in slices by spikey-haired demons...
Lisa,"""Howl of the Unappreciated"", by Lisa Simpson. ""I saw the best meal""..."
Lisa,Welcome back. Bart! I'm sorry we had such a terrible fight.
Lisa,"Yeah, beg me, Bart. Beg me!"
Lisa,"Dear Log, my brother is still missing, and maybe it's my fault because I failed to take his abuse with good humor. I miss him so much already, that I don't know..."
Lisa,Bart...?! Where are you?
Lisa,"Bart, what are you doing up here? Everybody's worried."
Lisa,Yes.
Lisa,"Bart, why did you burn my centerpiece?"
Lisa,"Was it because you hate me, or because you're bad?"
Lisa,Just tell me you're sorry.
Lisa,"Bart, the only reason to apologize is if you look deep down inside yourself and you find a spot, something you wish wasn't there, because you feel bad you hurt your sister's feelings."
Lisa,Just look!
Lisa,Apology accepted.
Lisa,"Yes, but I'm afraid the forces of history have changed wrestling, perhaps forever."
Lisa,"Oh, Bart, I hope you're not taking this seriously. Even a five-year-old knows that this is as choreographed as any ballet."
Lisa,Aren't you forgetting something?
Lisa,"I'll be playing my first solo. If you miss it on Saturday, I'd advise you to start looking for a child therapist on Sunday."
Lisa,I reached him.
Lisa,Dad?
Lisa,"Another barrier broken. Right on, sister!"
Lisa,Stop!
Lisa,"Springfield Gorge? Bart, you'll be killed!"
Lisa,"Please, before you do anything, there's someone I'd like you to talk to."
Lisa,"Thank you for arranging this, Dr. Hibbert."
Lisa,"Mr. Murdock, my brother is thinking about jumping Springfield Gorge on a skateboard."
Lisa,But Captain Murdock!
Lisa,"I'm sorry, Bart. But if you got hurt or died, despite the extra attention I'd receive, I'd miss you."
Lisa,"Hey, Mom. What're doing?/We were watching that!"
Lisa,"But, Mom! If you take our cartoons away, we'll grow up without a sense of humor and be robots."
Lisa,And I'm going over to Janey's again. We're going to be... um... making the most of our childhood years.
Lisa,We will.
Lisa,There's peas everywhere.
Lisa,There she is!
Lisa,All right!
Lisa,Itchy and Scratchy seem to have lost their edge.
Lisa,Maybe there's something else to do on this planet.
Lisa,And Janey and I went bird watching. We saw a grackle.
Lisa,Okay. May we please be excused?
Lisa,"Excuse me, Mr. Hutz. Are you a shyster?"
Lisa,"Hello, Dr. Hibbert."
Lisa,"Dad, may I please make an observation?"
Lisa,I think this is all a charade to make Bart look more injured than he really is.
Lisa,"Thursday -- meatloaf night. As it was, is now, and ever shall be."
Lisa,"Well, you're always trying to teach me to be opened-minded, try new things, live life to the..."
Lisa,"Friday night, pork chops. From cradle to grave... etched in stone in God's library somewhere..."
Lisa,"Anywhere but hamburgers, pizza or fried chicken."
Lisa,"As usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point entirely. Sushi is considered quite a delicacy."
Lisa,"Please, Dad. This argument humiliates us both."
Lisa,"Nothing, but you might say yes the ninety-ninth time."
Lisa,"Please, Dad."
Lisa,"Please, Dad."
Lisa,"Please, Dad."
Lisa,"Please, Dad."
Lisa,"Please, Dad."
Lisa,"Please, Dad...please"
Lisa,Make it two.
Lisa,Shaft.
Lisa,Shaft.
Lisa,Shut your mouth!
Lisa,I can dig it!
Lisa,John Shaft.
Lisa,"Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
Lisa,Why?
Lisa,Why are we using the good china?
Lisa,Why are we waiting for Dad?
Lisa,"Dad, do something!"
Lisa,No!
Lisa,How romantic.
Lisa,It's so hard to picture you two then. Hand in hand at the crossroads of life. There are so many questions.
Lisa,Okay. Uh... how did Dad propose to you?
Lisa,"So, it was love at first sight."
Lisa,Why you cagey ol' dog.
Lisa,"Everything I know tells me this story doesn't end with us sitting here, and you telling it to us."
Lisa,Cable? / Us? / Wow! / We have cable!
Lisa,"Dad, are you sure this isn't stealing?"
Lisa,"Mom, what are you doing?"
Lisa,"Well, don't you remember the Eighth Commandment?"
Lisa,Thou shalt not steal!
Lisa,"Dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?"
Lisa,"Well, at Sunday School we learned that stealing is a sin."
Lisa,"But everybody does it! I mean, we're stealing cable as we speak."
Lisa,No.
Lisa,"No, I didn't."
Lisa,"Dad, I think that's pretty spurious."
Lisa,"So, even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family, that would be stealing?"
Lisa,I see.
Lisa,"Maybe. I don't watch him every minute. But what I am sure of is, we're getting cable for free."
Lisa,Should I have my father arrested?
Lisa,"Thank you, Reverend Lovejoy."
Lisa,"Hi, Dad. I think stealing cable is wrong. So I'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example. It's the last you'll hear from me on the matter. Thank you for your time."
Lisa,"Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven."
Lisa,I just want to call attention to the fact that I'm not watching this fight. It's my form of non-violent protest.
Lisa,"Thanks, Mom. It doesn't seem to be going very well."
Lisa,"Dad, we may have saved your soul."
Lisa,"We're really proud of you, Dad."
Lisa,Go for it Dad!
Lisa,"Poor Brandy. Aunt Selma, do you think you'll ever get married?"
Lisa,"No. And, since I'm sure that you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece, I'll simply hope that you're one of the statistically insignificant forty-year-old single women who ever find their fair Prince."
Lisa,"Dad, Bart ate a green bean during the blessing."
Lisa,Eating is worse than opening eyes.
Lisa,Is too.
Lisa,Is too.
Lisa,Is too.
Lisa,Da-ad!...
Lisa,We didn't say anything.
Lisa,A long-lost half-brother. How Dickensian!
Lisa,Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Lisa,Heehaw!
Lisa,"Hello, Mr. Powell"
Lisa,"No, sir. I can assure you I am not."
Lisa,Marco!
Lisa,Marco!
Lisa,Watch me dive! Watch me dive! Watch me dive!
Lisa,You weren't watching! You weren't watching! You weren't watching!
Lisa,"I want to go on a pony ride, Unky Herb."
Lisa,Pony ride!
Lisa,Pony ride!
Lisa,Pony ride! Boat ride! Pony ride! Boat ride!
Lisa,What is it Unky Herb?
Lisa,The mouse is named Itchy.
Lisa,The cat is named Scratchy.
Lisa,And they're not shy about expressing it.
Lisa,Hello there. Do you miss the Antarctic?
Lisa,"Bye, Unky Herb."
Lisa,His life was an unbridled success until he found out he was a Simpson.
Lisa,"I'll make it, Mom. Just tape my lunch box to my hand."
Lisa,"If Bart stays home, I'm going to school."
Lisa,Get my homework from Mrs. Hoover.
Lisa,"Oh, no. I don't want to fall behind my class."
Lisa,Arithmetic.
Lisa,"Yuck. Quit it, Dad."
Lisa,Wow. Neat. It smells historic.
Lisa,"Oh, but I don't know how to sew."
Lisa,Very impressive!
Lisa,Ow!
Lisa,Ew.
Lisa,Keep on truckin'? What does that mean?
Lisa,"Ooh... phonics, functions, vocabulary, remedial reading? Oh, do your own homework, Bart!"
Lisa,"Eight. Thanks, Dad."
Lisa,"Gee, is it always this good?"
Lisa,Bad dog! Don't worry Snowball. You're safe with me.
Lisa,"Mom, what will we do if Santa's Little Helper doesn't learn anything in obedience school?"
Lisa,"Look, Mom, I finished my patch. It depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life."
Lisa,"On the left is Mr. Largo, my music teacher at school. He taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul. And on the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy. He taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth, so you better stick an instrument in front of it."
Lisa,And look!
Lisa,"I've suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog. But when I look into his vacant brown eyes, I just can't bear to let him go. I'm sure Mom agrees with me."
Lisa,"Dad, this is our pet. We can question his integrity and disposition, but we can't question his heart. Are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away?"
Lisa,Yea!
Lisa,"Sewing a new quilt. You know, it's one thing to be a link in a chain. It's another to start one of your own."
Lisa,This patch commemorates the destruction of the old quilt.
Lisa,"Bart, he's not gonna learn it now. Don't spend your last hours together tormenting the poor creature. Have some fun, frolic with him. Go get it, boy!"
Lisa,"Huh uh, he smells more like a photo lab."
Lisa,To the pony rides.
Lisa,Yes!
Lisa,That's gross.
Lisa,"Dad, it's just a dumb mud puddle."
Lisa,Discount Lion Safari!
Lisa,Discount Lion Safari!
Lisa,Do not feed animals. Do not allow animals in the car. Do not make eye contact with animals.
Lisa,It seems that most of the animals are sleeping.
Lisa,"Yeah, Bart, get out and push."
Lisa,Challenge accepted!
Lisa,"Grampa, that's the noblest thought that's ever been expressed at this table."
Lisa,"I don't deserve it, Grampa. No one here does. The people who deserve it are on the streets and they're in the slums. They're little children who need more library books and families who can't make ends meet. Of course, if you really wanted to, you could buy me a pony."
Lisa,I'll name her Princess and I'll ride her every day.
Lisa,This is a rather shameless promotion.
Lisa,Me too.
Lisa,Of course.
Lisa,Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?
Lisa,"Thanks, Dad."
Lisa,It is back.
Lisa,Whoooooaaaa!
Lisa,Mommy! I want my mommy!
Lisa,"Forgive us, Dad, but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response."
Lisa,"Mom, these are really good. While I know first-hand how fragile young talent is, I'd love to hear the particulars of how your gift was squashed."
Lisa,"Oh Mom, I can't believe you gave up painting because of one small-minded art teacher."
Lisa,And what was Ringo's response?
Lisa,Maybe you could take a class at Springfield Community College.
Lisa,"My mother would like to enroll in ""Painting From Life, 2-B""."
Lisa,Mom...
Lisa,Lincoln Lincoln I been thinkin' what the hell have you been drinkin'? / Is it water is it wine? / Oh my God it's turpentine! / Faster! Faster!
Lisa,Pass the moo juice.
Lisa,"Way to go, Dad."
Lisa,I was just practicing.
Lisa,"My god, she's been dumped again."
Lisa,I believe I know the answer.
Lisa,Lisa Simpson.
Lisa,"Um, one: Your belt buckle says ""State of Texas"", but Texas wasn't a state until 1845."
Lisa,Two: the revolver wasn't invented until 1835.
Lisa,Three: You seem to be of the Jewish faith.
Lisa,Or Italian?
Lisa,And there weren't any Jewish cowboys.
Lisa,"No! No! It wasn't me! I would never do anything like that. It was just one of those immature people who, instead of building themselves up --"
Lisa,"Yes, but I didn't do it."
Lisa,"No, but I'm starting to wish I had."
Lisa,I can't.
Lisa,"No, really, I can't."
Lisa,Please don't make me do it.
Lisa,"When I fall asleep, Mr. Bergstrom is the last thing I think of, and he's my first thought when I wake up."
Lisa,"No, no. You don't understand. When Mr. Bergstrom smiles, you only see these teeth --"
Lisa,"-- but when you really make him laugh, you can see these two teeth. I think they're called the eye teeth."
Lisa,"I don't know if he had orthodontic work or what, but they're absolutely perfect."
Lisa,"No, Mom. This is different. I mean, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better."
Lisa,"Mom, are we gonna talk, or are we gonna talk?"
Lisa,Fine.
Lisa,"Yesterday, he read us ""Charlotte's Web"", and cried at the end, never trying to hide his tears."
Lisa,"Yes! Yes, Mr. Bergstrom?"
Lisa,No. Homework's not my father's specialty.
Lisa,Not mine.
Lisa,"Unless the next word was burp, you didn't have to."
Lisa,"Oh, you'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator."
Lisa,When?
Lisa,"Places where my intelligence will be an asset, not a liability?"
Lisa,"I believe everything you say, with your words, your body language and your Semitic good looks."
Lisa,Mr. Bergstrom!
Lisa,Wow!
Lisa,Ewww. Gross.
Lisa,Oh Lord.
Lisa,He ruined the one chance I had of getting to know Mr. Bergstrom outside of school.
Lisa,"Oh, Mom, that's wonderful. Can I find out his favorite dish and help you make it!"
Lisa,Can I wear your jewelry?
Lisa,Can I get my ears pierced?
Lisa,Can I dye my shoes pink?
Lisa,Can I paint my nails?
Lisa,Can we have wine?
Lisa,Can I have wine?
Lisa,Does Bart have to be there?
Lisa,Can we do it this week?
Lisa,"Mr. Bergstrom, we request the pleasure of your company... no... Mr. Bergstrom, if you're not doing anything this Friday... no... Mr. Bergstrom, do you like pork chops... oh no, of course you wouldn't..."
Lisa,As am I.
Lisa,"I'M LISA -- PEPPY, BLONDE, AND STUNNING! / SOPHOMORE PROM QUEEN FIVE YEARS RUNNING! GOOOOOO LISA!"
Lisa,Here he is!
Lisa,"Look everybody, Maggie got her first tooth!"
Lisa,I WANT CANDY!
Lisa,GOT A NEW DANCE AND IT GOES LIKE THIS / AND THE NAME OF THE DANCE IS THE PEPPERMINT TWIST! YEAH!
Lisa,Ba-art!
Lisa,There must be some way out of this verdammten spell.
Lisa,"Oh, that's an excellent use of a genius brain: to look after an idiot head."
Lisa,That's the answer! Maggie's a real witch now! She can reverse the spell!
Lisa,"And furthermore,"
Lisa,Merry Christmas from the Simpsons!
Lisa,Shopping: it's the most fun you can have standing up.
Lisa,"Oh, you poor thing -- this is a tough time of year for someone who's allergic to holly, mistletoe, the red part of candy canes..."
Lisa,"Hi Zia, how did you do on your math test?"
Lisa,Wanna go to a concert tonight? Sixty-eight percent of the original Cher is playing.
Lisa,Sometimes I wish strangling your kid was still legal.
Lisa,'S okay. But you know who took her side? Marge Boooouuuuvier Simpson!
Lisa,"I am trying to deal with my disrespectful daughter, but you are too clueless to understand what that's like."
Lisa,"My daughter thinks I'm a ruthless tyrant, like Hitler or Prince Harry."
Lisa,"Godspeed, Bart. I'm gonna go apologize to Mom!"
Lisa,How do I get down?
Lisa,Mom... you're the best!
Lisa,I know where mine is...
Lisa,"And I'm going to take a page out of your playbook, and let it slide!"
Lisa,He took the boys out.
Lisa,"Hands off, hands off. Eh, screw it! Sometimes a mother's job is to butt in."
Lisa,"Google, even though you've enslaved half the world, you're still a damn fine search engine."
Lisa,Bingo.
Lisa,Argh.
Lisa,I open this door and I go from being one kind of mother to another.
Lisa,I was worried! I thought I would find...
Lisa,What? No! It doesn't matter what I thought. I'm sorry I spied on you. But what I found is my daughter looks up to me!
Lisa,But surely you didn't give up on love after just one setback. Love is our only defense against the abyss in this meaningless universe.
Lisa,"Actually, Terrence, this is a synthetic substance. Devised for zombie vegans, or ""Zegans."""
Lisa,What are you doing here?
Lisa,Garden brains.
Lisa,Too much sodium.
Lisa,The old Milhouse would have been helpless with an asthma attack.
Lisa,I love how you're dropping all your definite articles.
Lisa,"Uh, what are you cooking?"
Lisa,"Yes, well, uh..."
Lisa,But doctor... he's so much more interesting this way.
Lisa,That is so typical of you.
Lisa,I have to decide whether to make Milhouse human again. I even prefer the way he smells now. Some meat went bad in our freezer and my heart skipped a beat.
Lisa,"Mom, I've gotta know. Once and for all, what is the secret? Why did you stay with Dad so long?"
Lisa,Like my marriage.
Lisa,"Wait, Mom. Does that mean you're gonna take Dad back?"
Lisa,"Thanks, but Milhouse and I are in a pretty good place."
Lisa,"No, that's what happened in your false memories."
Lisa,There is no cure for zombie-ism.
Lisa,"No, you were real."
Lisa,You finally reached emotional maturity. Unlike Bart.
Lisa,How did my daughter turn into my brother?
Lisa,You parked the car. That helped.
Lisa,Maybe my Mom would have some ideas...
Lisa,You could go back to Michigan -- it's still under Sharia law.
Lisa,She told me to relax and bake cookies!
Lisa,"Oh, isn't that a little dangerous?"
Lisa,"Eh, why not?"
Lisa,Should I have married Nelson? 'Cause we still talk on the phone.
Lisa,Well... someone calls someone.
Lisa,"Oh, poor Bart. My daughter thinks I'm a lousy mother."
Lisa,Butt out.
Lisa,This is it. I'm going into the ultranet to save my daughter.
Lisa,"Lisa Simpson, the following people want to friend you."
Lisa,"Ignore, ignore, ignore... Ooh, Martin Prince is now ""Marcia Princess?"" No, I've got to find Zia."
Lisa,Not a good time.
Lisa,"Now, where is the Google door?"
Lisa,"Oh right, it's Dr. Seuss's birthday."
Lisa,I'd just throw in the towel and make it a state.
Lisa,"Okay honey, I made you pork chops just like you like 'em -- twenty."
Lisa,"As I told you when we talked last month, I've been doing a lot of charity work for the undead."
Lisa,Are you sure?
Lisa,"You know, I was thinking of taking a poetry class at the community college."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?"
Ned Flanders,"Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
Ned Flanders,"Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine?"
Ned Flanders,Well...
Ned Flanders,"Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers."
Ned Flanders,"Why Homer, you silly goose! The weed whacker's just for the edges! You're gonna be out here all day!"
Ned Flanders,"You are a picture and a half! Well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. We're gonna fire up old Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat! Nummy nummy num!"
Ned Flanders,Fee fi fo fum! I smell the potatoes au gratin of Marge Simp-son! Mmmm- mmm!
Ned Flanders,"Heya, Homer!"
Ned Flanders,"Okay, thanks for comin'!"
Ned Flanders,"Friends, we love you all, but I also have a ""sinister"" motive for asking you all here -- ""sinister"" being Latin for ""left-handed."" But enough joking."
Ned Flanders,"As of Friday, I'm saying toodle-oo to the pharmaceutical game."
Ned Flanders,"No, I kid you not. Here's the noose I had to wear for ten years."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, like one out of every nine Americans, I'm left-handed. And let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. Your writing gets smeared. Lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, I'm opening a one-stop store for Southpaws. Everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. I'm gonna call it the Leftorium."
Ned Flanders,"So Homer, I'm dyin' to know. What do you think of the Leftorium?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, no. The Springfield Mall."
Ned Flanders,"You must have something you want to wish for, Homer."
Ned Flanders,"Come on, Homer! I got an ambition to do some wishin'!"
Ned Flanders,"No, no, no, don't say. Otherwise it won't come true."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, a little pokey, but things are gonna pick up."
Ned Flanders,"Now, you put that money away. That was an accident."
Ned Flanders,Absotively posilutely.
Ned Flanders,N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, oh, I expect things to start picking up soon. I think word of mouth is startin' to spread."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, right as rain. Or, as we say around here, left as rain."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, okay."
Ned Flanders,"Come on, Homer. Tell him about the store. I'm dyin' out here."
Ned Flanders,Are you sure you're not interested? Two hundred dollars is only the asking price.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Thought I'd just get rid of some of the clutter. See anything you like?"
Ned Flanders,"Ah, got your eye on the gas grill. She's a butane beaut."
Ned Flanders,"Twenty? Homer, I paid three hundred dollars for this just last year."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Homer, be reasonable."
Ned Flanders,"All right, Homer."
Ned Flanders,Twenty dollars.
Ned Flanders,What?
Ned Flanders,Homer! Over here!
Ned Flanders,"Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, no, it's just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City. Hey what do think, kids? The big city!"
Ned Flanders,"Say, Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer. You're head of the car till I get back."
Ned Flanders,"Listen to that singing... those poor fools. Homer, I'm ruined."
Ned Flanders,"You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now."
Ned Flanders,I sold it to you for seven cents.
Ned Flanders,"You know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. It's like there's been a-a curse on me."
Ned Flanders,No it's not.
Ned Flanders,"No! You tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... I didn't listen. Homer, you were a true friend."
Ned Flanders,For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Homer, there's no point..."
Ned Flanders,Homer?
Ned Flanders,"Yes, sir!"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. But you made us friends."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, fellow slave, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things?"
Ned Flanders,Okely-dokely.
Ned Flanders,"Ohh, would ya look at that?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess my first wish is to get rid of those awful aliens."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer! This little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. Now that I've saved the earth, maybe I oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead."
Ned Flanders,Three dollars and fifty-one... fifty-two... fifty-three cents.
Ned Flanders,Hey ho Simpson.
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, there are two schools of thought..."
Ned Flanders,"Fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. Well sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake. Took me the whole afternoon to track him down."
Ned Flanders,"All right, that's it, young man. No Bible stories for you tonight."
Ned Flanders,"Well, you knew I had a temper when you married me."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry to bother you, Reverend Lovejoy, but I'm kind of in a tizzy. Our son Todd just told us he didn't want to eat his ""damn vegetables."""
Ned Flanders,"No Reverend, the point is, he said a bad word."
Ned Flanders,Where in the Bible?
Ned Flanders,But Reverend...
Ned Flanders,Is this all he watches?
Ned Flanders,"He's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure."
Ned Flanders,Homer?
Ned Flanders,I'm afraid I have a bone to pick with you.
Ned Flanders,"No, I-I came to talk to you about your potty-mouth."
Ned Flanders,"Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don't want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys."
Ned Flanders,What's wrong with my moustache?
Ned Flanders,What?
Ned Flanders,"Okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. I'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal."
Ned Flanders,... So recycling is our way of giving Mother Earth a great big hug.
Ned Flanders,Yes?
Ned Flanders,"Ho, ho, that's where you're wrong, friend."
Ned Flanders,Aren't we in luck? Today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. Come in my friend. Let us feed and bathe you.
Ned Flanders,"I think it's Mom's turn, son."
Ned Flanders,"Well, if you ever want to spend the night, Maude and I can sleep on card tables."
Ned Flanders,"Well, howdy-do neighbor."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, indeedily-doodily. I've even been in ""Streetcar"" once before. I played Blanche DuBois! Hmmm huh. Just part of the fun of going to an all-male school."
Ned Flanders,"Hot diggity! How 'bout that, Marge? Li'l ol' Stanley me! ""Stella!"" ""Stella!"" Heh heh."
Ned Flanders,Roger-dodger.
Ned Flanders,Aww... isn't that cute? And me without a camera.
Ned Flanders,You're a dame and I'm a fella.
Ned Flanders,All I want is one embrace.
Ned Flanders,"Here, Marge, let me. Hate to be an armchair Blanche, but I always gave it one of these..."
Ned Flanders,"there, there's the ol' face-shredder!"
Ned Flanders,You're a dame and I'm a fella.
Ned Flanders,All I want is one embrace.
Ned Flanders,I'm trying... I'm trying...
Ned Flanders,Aren't you being a little hard on old Homie?
Ned Flanders,Let's not and say we did.
Ned Flanders,STELLA! STELLLA! CAN'T YOU HEAR ME YELL-A? / YOU'RE PUTTIN' ME THROUGH HELL-A / STELLA! STELLA!
Ned Flanders,The door's frozen shut... and it's the only way out!
Ned Flanders,"Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, Christian life isn't all praying and sacrifice. Hey, dig this."
Ned Flanders,"I see him, son."
Ned Flanders,Homer! Homer!
Ned Flanders,Nooo!
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, may your loving hand guide Homer to the mattress square and true."
Ned Flanders,O-kay.
Ned Flanders,"Heck, you'd have done the same for me."
Ned Flanders,Help! Help!
Ned Flanders,"Homer, God didn't set your house on fire."
Ned Flanders,Hi fellow Halloweenies! Did I scaredly-dare ya?
Ned Flanders,"Well, howdy strangers! What can I do ya for?"
Ned Flanders,"Why, Sue Dokes, you rascal! I thought you were dead and--"
Ned Flanders,"Howdy-do, neighbor! Good pipe weather. Thought I'd fire up the briar."
Ned Flanders,Okely-dokely-do.
Ned Flanders,"Thank you, Plow King-a-lee-ding."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, Homer, why don't you plow it again?"
Ned Flanders,you'll be hist...
Ned Flanders,You'll be history!
Ned Flanders,"Buenos dias, neighboritos. The handle's Flanders, but my friends call me Ned."
Ned Flanders,"If you need anything, just give a whistle."
Ned Flanders,"Well, gee, I..."
Ned Flanders,I just this minute bought it at the hardware st...
Ned Flanders,"Sure, you can borrow it for a little while."
Ned Flanders,"We'll take good care of your boy, Simpson. Enjoy the miracle of creation."
Ned Flanders,"So, kids, what do you want to play?"
Ned Flanders,"Suppertime, boys."
Ned Flanders,"Oh Bart, you met Grandma Flanders. Hope she didn't scare ya."
Ned Flanders,"Heidy-ho, Simpson. Your son shoved this through our doggie door."
Ned Flanders,"And since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my TV tr..."
Ned Flanders,"Homer Simpson! Well, if that don't put the ""dink"" in co-inky-dink."
Ned Flanders,I'm having a kidney and a lung removed.
Ned Flanders,"First come, first served! What are you in for?"
Ned Flanders,"If I could give you my heart, Homer, I would."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, thank you for Ziggy comics, little baby ducks, and ""Sweatin' to the Oldies,"" Volumes One, Two and Four."
Ned Flanders,Monorail.
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homie, I can see your doodle!"
Ned Flanders,"IF YOU THINK I'M CUDDLY / AND YOU WANT MY COMPANY / COME ON WIFEY LET ME KNOW... UGH, UGH, UGH... OOOH..."
Ned Flanders,My name is Ned.
Ned Flanders,It's been four thousand days since my last drink. It was my first and last Blackberry schnapps.
Ned Flanders,Ann Landers is a boring old biddy.
Ned Flanders,I was more animal than man.
Ned Flanders,"Hi-ho pagans! New Years was three months ago, but here's a present anyhoo!"
Ned Flanders,April Fool's!
Ned Flanders,"Okely, dokely do!"
Ned Flanders,"Knock that off, you two. It's time for church!"
Ned Flanders,What?! You give me one good reason.
Ned Flanders,"I wish he were, Rod, I pray for the day, but I'm afraid he's just delirious from fever."
Ned Flanders,I can't imagine what we could've done to... Oh... oh no!
Ned Flanders,Uh oh.
Ned Flanders,Oh...the network slogan is true. Watch Fox and be damned for all eternity.
Ned Flanders,"Now, Marge, don't you worry. We've all had our brushes with the law."
Ned Flanders,"No, Ned Flanders."
Ned Flanders,I'll never have that problem again.
Ned Flanders,"Well, boys, who'd have thought learning about religion could be fun?"
Ned Flanders,Hey!
Ned Flanders,"You know, Reverend, this really isn't a hymn."
Ned Flanders,Oh my stars!
Ned Flanders,"Say your prayers, Simpson..."
Ned Flanders,... 'cause the schools can't force you like they should.
Ned Flanders,"Maude, these new finger-razors make hedge trimming as fun as sitting through church."
Ned Flanders,Hiedilly-hey!
Ned Flanders,Toodledy-doo!
Ned Flanders,Isn't that nice?
Ned Flanders,"Uh-oh. Better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose-news, neighbor."
Ned Flanders,Howdy gents. What can I diddily do you for?
Ned Flanders,"Well, that can be arranged."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, dear Lord!"
Ned Flanders,It's some sort of hideous monster.
Ned Flanders,"Aww, isn't that cute? He's trying to claw my eyes out."
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, Bart!"
Ned Flanders,Well howdilly dodilly-do!
Ned Flanders,Hello? Hello? Hellodilly-odilly?
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, careful there, Marge! Almost nicked me!"
Ned Flanders,"Hey now, Marge. Let's not ""should"" this fella to death."
Ned Flanders,"Well it's Bart Simpson! C'mon in! You're just in time for ""Sponge Bath the Old Folks Day!"""
Ned Flanders,"Now, just breathe into him every three seconds. Make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, now, everybody take out your Junior Campers pocketknives..."
Ned Flanders,"Oop, sorry, Bart, that's a Neddy no-no. You're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test."
Ned Flanders,"Here you go, your rubber training knife. You've attained the rank of Pussy Willow."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, kids, now I'm gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. But this should only be used in a life or death situation."
Ned Flanders,"Howdilly hey, Camper Bart. Ready for today's meeting?"
Ned Flanders,"Okilly dokilly. Now, our annual Father-Son Rafting Trip is next weekend."
Ned Flanders,"Oh Warren, I know your Dad is in prison, but don't you fret. A special Celebrity Dad has been arranged for ya."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry, but I'm afraid Ernest Borgnine has already been confirmed."
Ned Flanders,"Okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. Two dads to a raft."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, looks like we're boat buddies, huh? Want me to Zinc your sniffer?"
Ned Flanders,"I guess now we know why they call them rapids and not slow-pids, huh?"
Ned Flanders,Now what happened to that gosh darn map I brought?
Ned Flanders,"Whoa, Nelly!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, quick, Homer! Which way do we turn--?"
Ned Flanders,Uh-oh... no time.
Ned Flanders,"Matthew, Mark, Luke-and-John!"
Ned Flanders,"Paddle harder, Homer. We gotta fight the current."
Ned Flanders,"Again? Homer, we have to ration the water carefully. It's our only hope."
Ned Flanders,"Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die."
Ned Flanders,Here's our chance! Dolphins always help humans lost at sea.
Ned Flanders,"Come back! Come back! Oh, we're done for! We're done for! We're Done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily..."
Ned Flanders,"Thank you, Homer, I dunno what got--"
Ned Flanders,Diddily.
Ned Flanders,"You know, Homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food."
Ned Flanders,"Godspeed, li'l doodle."
Ned Flanders,"That's what you're smelling, Homer! Oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!"
Ned Flanders,"Homer Simpson! That's a dilly of a pickle. Hey, let's conference you with Marge, huh?"
Ned Flanders,"Kids, did anyone pray for giant shoes?"
Ned Flanders,Okilly dokilly.
Ned Flanders,"What do you think, Reverend?"
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, neighboreenos."
Ned Flanders,You folks got robbed too? The burglar took my Shroud of Turin beach towels.
Ned Flanders,"Welcome, neighbors... since the police can't seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, I think it's time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni!"
Ned Flanders,"Now, who should lead the group?"
Ned Flanders,"I don't really have very much experience, but I'll be---"
Ned Flanders,Hidilly ho!
Ned Flanders,Ned Flanders...
Ned Flanders,"Oh golly, if that doesn't put the shaz in shazam. Oh listen, what's the cash value of those tickets so I can report it on my income tax?"
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, neighbor. Wanna go to the game with me? I got two tic..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, get out the Crayolas and color me tickled pink! Oh, what's with the lead pipe? Were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?"
Ned Flanders,What?
Ned Flanders,"Wow, these are amazing seats, huh Homer?"
Ned Flanders,"Relax, Homer, I keep tellin' ya, you're my guest."
Ned Flanders,"Heh-heh, yeah."
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, Stanster."
Ned Flanders,"Stan, tell you what -- Homer Simpson here is just about the biggest Atom fan that's ever graced God's green earth. I bet he'd enjoy it, even more than me."
Ned Flanders,"Ooo, I guess it's time for me to duck again."
Ned Flanders,"Heydilly ho, window buddy. Just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, be careful there, Homer. That is sort of a new table."
Ned Flanders,"Now, boys, Mr. Simpson is the guest. He gets to decide what to watch."
Ned Flanders,Sure didilly do. Over two hundred and thirty channels locked out.
Ned Flanders,Wait a second. You're the man at the hospital who reads to sick children.
Ned Flanders,"...Bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I-I'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night I do my charity work."
Ned Flanders,Oh... well... that sounds super duper.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at Moe's tonight."
Ned Flanders,"Sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly..."
Ned Flanders,"How are my boys doin', Homer?"
Ned Flanders,"Eh, well sir. My entire family is very touched and--"
Ned Flanders,We're headin' back. Todd's got Zesty Italian in his eye.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I don't know..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh Lord, please give me the strength to endure Homer Simpson's friendship."
Ned Flanders,There's Homer. There's Homer too. That's also Homer. That's Homer.
Ned Flanders,I -- I think I hate Homer Simpson.
Ned Flanders,Oh! Almost. Boy that was close.
Ned Flanders,"Ah, uh, Homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother. Family only. You know?"
Ned Flanders,"No, I-I mean just the Flanders family."
Ned Flanders,We're not going anywhere.
Ned Flanders,"I can't, it's a Geo!"
Ned Flanders,"We did it, we got rid of..."
Ned Flanders,"I told you, officer. I'm not ""hepped up"" on ""goof balls."""
Ned Flanders,"I can't do it, Maude. I can't face their accusing eyes."
Ned Flanders,I think we should leave.
Ned Flanders,Stop it! Breathe through your damn mouth!
Ned Flanders,"Oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! He's annoying. He's very, very annoying!"
Ned Flanders,"Thank you. Thank you so much, Homer. You really are a you're a true friend."
Ned Flanders,Just try and stop me.
Ned Flanders,"Hi-diddly ho, neighbor."
Ned Flanders,Okilly-dokilly.
Ned Flanders,It's the Four Elephants of the Apocalypse!
Ned Flanders,"Well, gettin' closer."
Ned Flanders,"Well, tippity-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body here! As chairman of the PTA, I Am dee-diddily-lighted to take over, and I think I can put the ""pal"" back in principal."
Ned Flanders,Now I know everybody's eager to get back to class --
Ned Flanders,But I thought it might break the ice if we had a little Q and A.
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, you."
Ned Flanders,"Well, let me just say I want to put the ""stew"" back in students."
Ned Flanders,"Bart, I've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. And now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour."
Ned Flanders,"Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished. This isn't just some sort of club house."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, sorry, were you drinking Slice or Yoo-Hoo?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick, but that's, that's because my dad was so hard on me when I was a boy."
Ned Flanders,Woopsy-doodle.
Ned Flanders,"Well, cockily-Doodily-Doo, little buddies. Let's thank the Lord for another beautiful school day."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent. May the Lord bless and keep you."
Ned Flanders,Okily-dokily.
Ned Flanders,We might as well make it official.
Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, what a pleasant..."
Ned Flanders,But you rang my...
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer, what's the big brouhaha? Ha."
Ned Flanders,Ohmygod! What have I done? I've killed her!
Ned Flanders,I wish there was some other explanation for this. But there isn't. I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer!
Ned Flanders,I'm a murdiddly-erdiler.
Ned Flanders,"Mommy had to go away. She's with God, now."
Ned Flanders,Soon enough.
Ned Flanders,MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB / LITTLE LAMB / LITTLE LAMB...
Ned Flanders,It's time to put you away.
Ned Flanders,Put you away for good.
Ned Flanders,"What the gumdrops is going on, here?"
Ned Flanders,Murdered?
Ned Flanders,"All right. It's true. I am a murderer. I over-watered Maude's favorite ficus plant, I panicked, and then I buried the remains. I was hoping to replace it before you got home."
Ned Flanders,"Huh? Well, now that I can't explain."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, why that sounds like Gabriel's trumpet. You know what that means, kids?"
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, slave-a-reenos."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I see by the big board we've got a Negative Nellie in Sector Two. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask the whole family to kinda freeze and prepare for re-Neducation."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, everybody. Let's see some big smiles."
Ned Flanders,"Just relax, let the hooks do their work."
Ned Flanders,"Now, in case all that smilin' didn't cheer ya up, there's one thing that never fails. A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy."
Ned Flanders,You just be ready with that garbage bag.
Ned Flanders,"Hi-de-ho-e-roonie, neighbor. What can I do you for?"
Ned Flanders,"I kinda figured this might happen, so I built the shelter big enough for both our families."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Howdilly doodilly neighbors. Shouldn't you be in your sheltereenees by now?"
Ned Flanders,"Well sorry, the shelter's kinda full."
Ned Flanders,Wait!
Ned Flanders,"I may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive, but oh, what the hey..."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, sounds fair. Toodle-oo, everybody. I'll, I'll scream when the comet gets here."
Ned Flanders,"No, sweetheart, you stay here because--"
Ned Flanders,"I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in."
Ned Flanders,Okay.
Ned Flanders,"QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE / THE FUTURE'S NOT OURS TO SEE..."
Ned Flanders,"QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE..."
Ned Flanders,"WHEN I WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL / I ASKED MY MOTHER WHAT WILL I BE / WILL I BE PRETTY, WILL I BE RICH? / HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID TO ME..."
Ned Flanders,"Whatcha diddily doin', neighbor?"
Ned Flanders,Is that so? Well gee... maybe the old FlandersMobile could use a...
Ned Flanders,Lucky I always keep a Bible close to my heart.
Ned Flanders,Lucky I was wearing an extra large piece of the True Cross today. I think I'll go inside.
Ned Flanders,"Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. Okay? Lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- Action Jackson!"
Ned Flanders,"Flanders to God, Flanders to God! Get off your cloud and save my Todd."
Ned Flanders,"Thanks, God."
Ned Flanders,"'Zounds, I did thee mightily smite-ly."
Ned Flanders,"""'Zounds"" is a renaissance English word, short for ""God's Wounds."" But uh, ""smite-ly,"" that's pure Flanders!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the Flanderosa."
Ned Flanders,"All right, I'd like to call this meeting of the PTA to or-diddly-order and let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss, huh? Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess this is a case where we'll have to agree to disagree."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, this is a dilly of a pickle."
Ned Flanders,"No, no. The PTA has not disbanded."
Ned Flanders,We do have an emergency plan in case of a prolonged strike right here.
Ned Flanders,"Let's see. ""Replace teachers with super-intelligent cyborgs. Or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood."""
Ned Flanders,"Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... Oh my Lord!! Something horrible has happened!"
Ned Flanders,Oh.
Ned Flanders,Yeah.
Ned Flanders,That's a good one.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess I am putting up the Halloweenie decorations a little early. Criticism accepted."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, okay folks, look. I called the Police Captain in Shelbyville. He says he hasn't seen our kids, but if they show up in the morgue he's gonna fax us."
Ned Flanders,"Well, okay, but, you know, just go a little bit easy on the..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors. I, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town."
Ned Flanders,It won't start! Something's draining the battery?!
Ned Flanders,Yes. Eat all of our shirts.
Ned Flanders,Dear Lord. That's the loudest profanity I've ever heard.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel."
Ned Flanders,"Heydilly-ho! Welcome to your new home, neglect-areenos!"
Ned Flanders,Mmm-hmm. All we want to do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, kids! Nachos, Flanders-style! That's cucumbers with cottage cheese."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Bart. I know you're still getting adjusted here. Tell you what. We'll do whatever you want to do."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess a little television won't hurt. I used to let the boys watch ""My Three Sons,"" but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, er, that's just raspberry jam."
Ned Flanders,"No, son. No sirree, Bob."
Ned Flanders,Peek-a-boo! I see you!
Ned Flanders,Peek-a-boo! I see you!
Ned Flanders,"C'mon, you Gloomy Gusses. Who's up for a big bowl of non-fat ice milk?"
Ned Flanders,"Nighty night, my sweet li'l foundling-a-dings."
Ned Flanders,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE / BUT YOU GOT US, AND BABY, WE GOT YOU."
Ned Flanders,"BABE. WE GOT YOU, BABE."
Ned Flanders,"Well, children, it's Saturday night, so what say we let our hair down and play Bombardment..."
Ned Flanders,...of Bible questions.
Ned Flanders,Which version shall it be?
Ned Flanders,Vulgate it is.
Ned Flanders,Okay. For one gold star: What Persian king exempted the Levites from taxation?
Ned Flanders,Righty-o!
Ned Flanders,Well...
Ned Flanders,"No, Son, we've got to let Bart and Lisa get one. C'mon, this one's easy."
Ned Flanders,"Well, guess! Book of Revelations... Fire-breathing lion's head... tail made out of snakes... Who else is it gonna be?!"
Ned Flanders,Jes... ? Jes... ? Don't you kids know anything? The serpent of Rehaboam? The well of Zohassadar? The bridal feast of Beth Chadruharazzeb?
Ned Flanders,"No, that ain't gonna do it."
Ned Flanders,Jeepers H. Crackers! I'd better call the Reverend!
Ned Flanders,Reverend... Emergency... I... You... Simpson kids... Eedily... Baptism... Oodily... Doodily-doodily...
Ned Flanders,Looks like I'm gonna have to baptize you myself.
Ned Flanders,"Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents. But now I know you kids need a less hellbound family."
Ned Flanders,Today we write a new page in the Flanders family bible.
Ned Flanders,Who wants to be the first to enter God's good graces?
Ned Flanders,"Do you reject Satan, and all his empty promises?"
Ned Flanders,"Wait, Homer. What did you just say?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, fair enough."
Ned Flanders,"Rod, you order anything you want for your big ten-oh."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I expect that type of language at Denny's, but not here."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, gosh, Homer, this is strictly a Flanders affair. I've got family here from around the globe! Here's José Flanders..."
Ned Flanders,And this is Lord Thistlewick Flanders...
Ned Flanders,Can I come?
Ned Flanders,"Congratulations, Homer. Your Q is a huge success. A toast to the host who can boast the most roast."
Ned Flanders,"Help me! Help me, Lord!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, as the tree said to the lumberjack -- I'm stumped."
Ned Flanders,No.
Ned Flanders,Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.
Ned Flanders,"You have our deepest condol-diddly-olences. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous, I didn't mean any disrespect."
Ned Flanders,You know...
Ned Flanders,Homer's passing...away.
Ned Flanders,Into death.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Marge. Of course Homer's alive. He's alive in all our hearts."
Ned Flanders,It's me... Ned.
Ned Flanders,"So if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial Christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the Hibbert table. Pronto."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, looks like we got some nice items here at Table Glick. Like this..."
Ned Flanders,"What the heckaroonie is this, Mrs. Glick?"
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh. Well, I... uh, I guess you could put a lot of nice things in there--"
Ned Flanders,"Well, looks like somebody sold something today."
Ned Flanders,"Now, folks, nothin' spells fun like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, I'm welcoming the Bushes on behalf of the Neighborhood Association."
Ned Flanders,"Howdily-Doodily there, President Bush--or should I say President Neighbor! I'm Ned Flanders, and this is Maude, Rod and Todd."
Ned Flanders,Tip-top-notch!
Ned Flanders,Thankily-dankily! Greatalicious!
Ned Flanders,"Now, Todd, don't scare the president."
Ned Flanders,Who? Maude and me?
Ned Flanders,"Thankily-dank, Mayor, I shan't disappoint. Har ye, har ye! I declare myself pickled tink about Springfield's Bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial Day!"
Ned Flanders,"Aw, they're just family heirlooms. That shouldn't stand in the way of Homer takin' my job and--"
Ned Flanders,"Well, hey, it's Homer! Good to see ya, neighb--"
Ned Flanders,"Howdy, Reverend Lovejoy. Nice to see you there ... on my lawn... with your dog."
Ned Flanders,"Better get the ol' snow shovel back from Homer, huh?"
Ned Flanders,Marge Simpson -- still making juice the old-fashioned way?
Ned Flanders,Why don't you freeze it with an ice cube and hit it with a hammer? Works for me when I get bubbly-gum in the ol' push-broom.
Ned Flanders,Hmm. I seem to have mashed more hair into it. Oh well.
Ned Flanders,"Well, howdilly-doodily, stranger! Couldn't help but notice you stealing my boat."
Ned Flanders,You ever operated a power boat?
Ned Flanders,Know anything about water safety?
Ned Flanders,What do you need it for?
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, sounds spine-tingly-dingling. Just promise you'll have a good time."
Ned Flanders,Maude? Boys? Come on up! We're gonna have a little camp-out in the dinghy.
Ned Flanders,"Open the door, Maude! I don't have time for the secret knock!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, now realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. I was all set to go off on vacation, when I get called up for jury duty. Oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums."
Ned Flanders,"Now they're trying it as a maritime offense. So anyhoo, how'd you like to use my beach house? Free of charge."
Ned Flanders,"Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again."
Ned Flanders,"Hello, ""Mr. Brown Ground"", whatcha got for me?"
Ned Flanders,"Uh... Homer... Ah, about those things you borrowed from me over the years -- you know -- the TV trays, the power sander, that downstairs bathtub... you going to be needing those things in Cypress Creek?"
Ned Flanders,Oh... uh...
Ned Flanders,Okily dokily.
Ned Flanders,'Bye-diddly-i.
Ned Flanders,"Well, if God didn't make little green apples -- it's Homer Simpson! How long have you been here?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, suckin' down the cider, eh? Hey, word to the wise... season pass!"
Ned Flanders,"Pays for itself after the 16th visit. You know, most people don't know the difference between apple cider and apple juice. But I do. Now here's a little trick to help you remember..."
Ned Flanders,"If it's clear and yellow, you've got juice there, fellow! If it's tangy and brown, you're in Cider Town! Now there's two exceptions, and it gets kinda tricky here..."
Ned Flanders,"...Adirondack cider can be yellow if they're using late-season apples. And, of course, in Canada the whole thing's flip-flopped..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, my. I better get you some cider."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, it's an angry mob, ma'am. Could you step outside for a twinkle while we knock down your house?"
Ned Flanders,"That's dignity, all right."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm convinced. The house stays!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, we all changed our minds."
Ned Flanders,"I'm sorry, it really was one of those spur-of-the-moment-type things."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, I like his films, except for that nervous fella who's always in 'em."
Ned Flanders,"Oo, that's a noodle scratcher."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, righty-o! It's good for keeping down the urges."
Ned Flanders,Howdilly-doodilly.
Ned Flanders,Ach! It was that darn recording again!
Ned Flanders,Howdilly-dood...
Ned Flanders,Dang!
Ned Flanders,But it could be my mother! Howdi...
Ned Flanders,Shoot!
Ned Flanders,Howdilly-doodily...
Ned Flanders,"Well, need some help there? You know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, it'll be fun. We're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. Make sure we don't owe anything extra."
Ned Flanders,"No, sirree, we'd be happy as hens to ha--"
Ned Flanders,"Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
Ned Flanders,It's all gone. Everything... gone-diddily-on.
Ned Flanders,Maude? Rod? Todd?
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, everyone's alive. Guess that's something to be thankful for."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, it's kinda funny. The only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. They're all we have left."
Ned Flanders,"Lookin' good, Rod. Lookin' good."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend Lovejoy, with all that's happened to us today -- Uh, I... I kinda feel like Job."
Ned Flanders,"But Reverend, I need to know. Is God punishing me?"
Ned Flanders,"Even in my darkest hour, I can turn to the Good Book for..."
Ned Flanders,Son of a gun-diddily-un! Those gilded edges smart!
Ned Flanders,Uh-huh. Floor feels a little gritty here.
Ned Flanders,"Why me, Lord? Where have I gone wrong? I've always been nice to people. I don't drink or dance or swear. I've even kept kosher, just to be on the safe side. I've done everything the Bible says, even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff. What more could I do? I... I feel like I'm coming apart here. I want to yell out, but I... I... I just can't dang-diddily-do-dang-do-don-diddily-darn-do it. I... I...I..."
Ned Flanders,"Aw, what happened now? Did the rubble burn down?"
Ned Flanders,It's a miracle!
Ned Flanders,"It's wonderful. I... I... I don't know how I can possibly repay you, but if any of you ever need a favor, just look for the happiest man in Springfield."
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh. Ooh, looks like a loose nail."
Ned Flanders,"Was that... uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, something is definitely wrong with this hallway!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I've seen about enough."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, now, calm down Neddilly-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily... They did their best... Shoddily-iddily-iddily-diddily... Gotta be nice... hostility-ilitity-bility-dility -- Aw, hell, diddly-ding-dong-crap! Can't you morons do anything right?!!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, my family and I can't live in good intentions, Marge! Oh, your family is out of control, but we can't blame you, because you have goooood intentions."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, okay ""Dude."" I wouldn't want you to have a cow, ""Man."" Here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years: ""Hey, buddy, got a quarter?"""
Ned Flanders,Do I hear the sound of butting in? It's gotta be little Lisa Simpson -- Springfield's answer to a question no one asked!
Ned Flanders,"What do we have here? The long, flabby arm of the law. The last case you got to the bottom of was a case of Mallomars."
Ned Flanders,"Oh yeah, the clown. The only one of you buffoons who doesn't make me laugh. And as for you -- I don't know you, but I'm sure you're a jerk."
Ned Flanders,"You ugly, hate-filled man."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you are the worst human being I have ever met."
Ned Flanders,I attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to help me. I'd like to commit myself.
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, kicking and screaming, please."
Ned Flanders,Noooooooooooo!
Ned Flanders,"Uh, actually, I'm a little chilly. Could I have another straitjacket?"
Ned Flanders,Thank you. Doctor Foster?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, sure. I was a good little boy."
Ned Flanders,I can't believe I was such a terror.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'll be darn-diddly-arned."
Ned Flanders,It sure did-diddly-id.
Ned Flanders,"Well, howdy, Homer!"
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, thanks for dropping by!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, well, I'll just have to try harder! Oops, thanks for dropping by."
Ned Flanders,"Ho ho ho. Very funny, wise guy."
Ned Flanders,"Hi, neighbor!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, now, why would I be afraid of that?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, maybe a few of them do. Back East."
Ned Flanders,"Mmm, mmm. 'Sure are fun to scratch. Mmm. Satisfying."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, they hum like angels. You're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light."
Ned Flanders,"No, that's not true. I... I... I don't like the service at the post office. Y'know, it's all rush, rush, get you in, get you out. Then, they've got those machines in the lobby. They're even faster. No help there. You might even say I hate the post office. That, and my parents. Lousy beatniks! Hey, that felt good!"
Ned Flanders,"Thanks, everyone. I'm all better now. No more storing up the anger 'til I explode. If any of you does something I don't like, you are gonna hear about it!"
Ned Flanders,"And if you really tick me off, I'm gonna run you down with my car!"
Ned Flanders,Um-hm.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I admit it! It's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! I just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids."
Ned Flanders,"We'll see, son. We'll see."
Ned Flanders,"Sure, buddy, I'd be happy to..."
Ned Flanders,...help out. What can I do-diddily-do...diddily-doodily-diddily-hoobily-hobbily-hibbily-gooble-gobble-gooble-gooble-gabba-gabba-hey?
Ned Flanders,"Uh, were you on my roof last night, stealing my weathervane?"
Ned Flanders,Hi-dilly-ho Shary Bobbins!
Ned Flanders,"THEY'RE NOT PERFECT, BUT THE LORD SAYS LOVE THY NEIGHBOR --"
Ned Flanders,OKELY-DOKELY-DO.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I can honestly say that was the best episode of Impy and Chimpy I've ever seen."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. Y'know, Maude and her mother were visiting Tyre and Sidon, the twin cities of the Holy Land. They must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong God, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort."
Ned Flanders,"Well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but I have to drive to Capital City, fill out some forms to get 'em out. Could you possibly watch the kids tonight?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I don't know, Lisa. You're awfully young, and the boys can be a handful. Todd's been pinching everyone lately."
Ned Flanders,"Well, what do you say, Homer? Can Lisa babysit for my kids?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, imagine that -- sleeping quietly after a bug attack! Oh, and Todd's as dry as a bone! Lisa, you're a wonder! I'm going to recommend you to everybody!"
Ned Flanders,"Lisa, Ned Flanders. You available tonight?"
Ned Flanders,You did? Just a minute. What time can you come over?
Ned Flanders,"Well, if you're talking about root beer, I plead guilt-didilly-ilty as char-dardilly-arged."
Ned Flanders,I'm meek... but I could probably stand to be meeker.
Ned Flanders,"...Well, I... I think I may be coveting my own wife..."
Ned Flanders,I think I swallowed a toothpick.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, I'm in some hot soup here, Marge. Uh, some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store. I... I think they could start slacking at any moment."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, well, if you're sure that'll help..."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, excuse me, fellas... I... I couldn't help thinking it might be nice if you could uh, vamoose, you know. If possible."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, Marge, I... I appreciate your advice, but, uh, things have gotten... Well, they... they're a lot worse."
Ned Flanders,"I know, but... they're on their mini-bikes and all..."
Ned Flanders,Boys... there's a call here for you...
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, it's Ned Flanders. The teens have been chasing me all night. They finally stopped to gas up their scooters."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I can't see the name of the station... but the gas costs one forty-nine and eight tenths."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, they're leaving! The ordeal is over!"
Ned Flanders,Help! What do I do?!
Ned Flanders,Tell Maude I want a fancy funeral. Big coffin. Lotsa jewels.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, thank the Lord! He's truly watching over--"
Ned Flanders,"You saved me, Reverend. You really went above and beyond. Thank you!"
Ned Flanders,Amen.
Ned Flanders,Uh... Homer?
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, I hate to be a Suspicious Aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?"
Ned Flanders,"Now, now, there's plenty of exits for everyone."
Ned Flanders,"Ex... ex... excuse me, sir? I think you've got my TV. Sir?"
Ned Flanders,"Ho-ho-ho, you betcha. Team sports'll keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls."
Ned Flanders,"Little higher, Wendell... A lot higher, Martin... Ah, Ralph, that's a basketball."
Ned Flanders,"Oof! Okay, Nelson's our quarterback."
Ned Flanders,"Ralph, you'll be on special teams."
Ned Flanders,"And, uh, Bart, you'll be a tackle."
Ned Flanders,"Well, that's super-duper, Lisa! In fact, we already have four girls on the team."
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh, but we'd love to have you on board."
Ned Flanders,"Well, actually, Lisa, these balls are synthetic."
Ned Flanders,Who are we?
Ned Flanders,Who are we going to beat?
Ned Flanders,"All right, Wildcats! Are you ready to give 110 per cent, take it one game at a time, and go the whole nine yards?"
Ned Flanders,"Okilly-dokilly, let's put on our game faces."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah. Thanks for the tip, Homer..."
Ned Flanders,What?
Ned Flanders,What?! What is it?!
Ned Flanders,"They're just words, Neddie. Words can't hurt ya."
Ned Flanders,Ow! That's it!
Ned Flanders,Do you have a problem with the way I'm coaching?
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh. Half a brain, huh? Well, you know what? It sounds like you just volunteered!"
Ned Flanders,"Good luck, Homer. No hard feelin's."
Ned Flanders,You mean like... an angel?!!
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho, I gotta say, Lisa, it sounds like you're strainin' to do some explainin'."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we can work this out, friends. In the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--"
Ned Flanders,"Hey-hey there, Marge. Just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
Ned Flanders,"Thanks anyway, Homer."
Ned Flanders,I'll take four!
Ned Flanders,"Science is like a blabbermouth who ruins a movie by telling you how it ends. Well, I say there are some things we don't want to know! Important things!"
Ned Flanders,"We've come for the angel, Homer. It's not safe with the unbeliever."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, I've got to admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated."
Ned Flanders,"Well, shall we sing a hymn? Uh, ""Nearer My God to Thee"", maybe? Or, or, or ""Amazing Grace""?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, nothing's perfect, I sure hate to make you come out here and not buy a house."
Ned Flanders,I guess it is sorta cute...
Ned Flanders,"Hm. Wh-when you put it that way, it does seem a bit small."
Ned Flanders,"Oooo, that's a dilly. How 'bout it, Marge?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, my-diddily-i. Will you look at this place! And the price has been slashed repeatedly!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm just gonna spill my guts: I love it to death! I'm gonna give you a deposit this minute."
Ned Flanders,Unless you can give me a reason not to?
Ned Flanders,"Well, Marge?"
Ned Flanders,That's good enough for me.
Ned Flanders,Purple drapes! All my life I've wanted purple drapes!
Ned Flanders,"Well, neighborinos, I guess this is goodbye... I better make this quick or I'm gonna start blubbering like a baby."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, now that you mention it, we could use..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you're sweet to offer, but, uh, we're all just so tired, we just want to get to our new house and rest in peace."
Ned Flanders,"So long, Simpsons!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, hi, Marge. Heh-heh. Guess we gave you quite a start. We were painting Todd's room red -- pretty messy work -- and then we came out here to take a break. Must've dozed off."
Ned Flanders,This is the murder house?!
Ned Flanders,"Ahh, of course! This must be where he dropped the dagger. And this is the butler's pantry where Mrs. Astor concealed herself. And right here's where they found the torso heap! In front of our very own fireplace!"
Ned Flanders,"We appreciate the offer, Marge, but I think we're going to be very happy here."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, Marge? Still got that deposit check?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. Well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours."
Ned Flanders,There goes Christmas dinner.
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho-ho. No problem, Marge. Oh."
Ned Flanders,I don't think that's gonna do it.
Ned Flanders,"Looks like slim pickin's today, Reverend."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, I made some Rice Krispy squares for our hungry deprogramerinos!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, this is my rumpus room."
Ned Flanders,"Oh ho, I'm afraid I played a dirty part in this little charade."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? Anyone like a draft beer?"
Ned Flanders,"You know, I pride myself on being a good host, so I'm obliged to offer you a beer. But I'm so darn mad it's gonna be mostly head."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, is that your collar, Reverend?"
Ned Flanders,Oops! That's for me. Flancrest Enterprises is my home business.
Ned Flanders,"No-ho-ho, it's true! Maude and I sell religious hook rugs over the Internet."
Ned Flanders,"Yes indeedy. Makin' some good scratch, too."
Ned Flanders,Yep.
Ned Flanders,"It says ""Show me your tie."" It's cute. C'mon, let's go."
Ned Flanders,"Whoa! January first! Better get goin' on those taxes, Neddy!"
Ned Flanders,"Hmmm. Let's see, cash-register ink. Well, sir, that's a business expense, isn't it? Mmm... But then I do enjoy the smell of the stuff -- better not risk it."
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh, why, everything! Policemen, trees, sunshine. And let's not forget the folks who just don't feel like workin', God bless 'em."
Ned Flanders,8:45?! Here I am yappin' away like it's 8:35. Don't forget the mints.
Ned Flanders,Get your taxes out of the way?
Ned Flanders,"Easy, Ned, don't breathe in."
Ned Flanders,Oooooh!
Ned Flanders,"Uh, listen Homer, ah, hate to be a fussy Freddy and all, but Maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors..."
Ned Flanders,"Rod, get off of there!"
Ned Flanders,WHO CAN?
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, please take Mr. Bunny up to heaven."
Ned Flanders,Heh. Sports on a Sunday? Hm. I'd better check with Reverend--
Ned Flanders,"Now, the secret to the windmill hole is to--"
Ned Flanders,Bingo.
Ned Flanders,Hmm. That's odd. It didn't come out the rear end.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, now Roddy, it's just a stuck ball. I'll get it."
Ned Flanders,"Hm, maybe there is something in there."
Ned Flanders,"Well, something's in there all right."
Ned Flanders,It was people. People soiled our green!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, here come the Simpsons. N-Now be careful, Homer. There's a fella in the sand right in front of ya..."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, is that my muffler?"
Ned Flanders,"Thanks for the tip, Homer."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, please make tonight's production better than ""Othello"" with Peter Marshall."
Ned Flanders,"Howdy, Homer."
Ned Flanders,"Well, that's not quite true--"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I did, but--"
Ned Flanders,"Well, yes."
Ned Flanders,"I suppose, if you must know... I'm... well, I'm... I'm sixty."
Ned Flanders,"L-Listen, folks, there's no magic formula. I just follow the three C's: clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of Vitamin Church."
Ned Flanders,"And, of course, I resist all the major urges."
Ned Flanders,"No, no, and double-no! I haven't done any of those things, folks. You name it, I haven't done it!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, can you believe it? It almost seemed like those folks were, were, were making fun of old steady Neddy."
Ned Flanders,"Mmm-hmm. And some people steer clear of that whole hornet's nest. I'll stick with just plain white bread, thank you very much. Maybe with a--"
Ned Flanders,Gosh darn it! Am I that pre-diddley-dictable? I've wasted my whole dang diddley life.
Ned Flanders,Look at that! Everyone's living it up except Ned.
Ned Flanders,In the bathroom. Not trimmin' my mustache. Whaddaya think? Do I remind you of troubled troubadour David Crosby?
Ned Flanders,Would a silly billy sit like this?
Ned Flanders,"Never a dull moment, huh, Homer?"
Ned Flanders,"Here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, Homer. But I, I was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, I, I guess I do."
Ned Flanders,"How 'bout it, Homer? Will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?"
Ned Flanders,Stop that! Will you help me or not?
Ned Flanders,So what about all this meat?
Ned Flanders,Seems fair.
Ned Flanders,"Of course I... Oh, my stars! I can't do that."
Ned Flanders,All right.
Ned Flanders,"So, what happens next?"
Ned Flanders,"Okay, Homer. I'm ready to learn. What's the first lesson? Just give me the topic sentence."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, they blew that up yesterday."
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, it's goin' on eight-thirty. I'd better call Maude and tell her where I am."
Ned Flanders,"Thanks, buddy."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, gee, Homer, this all looks so garish."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, the lights, the noise, the letter X -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. I'm overstimulated! I gotta get out of this town!"
Ned Flanders,"No, I got it."
Ned Flanders,"If he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that ramp."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, when I wanna laugh, I'll take Bob Saget, thank you very much."
Ned Flanders,"No, Homer, no! I wanna do something exciting, but I can't just go from zero to thirty like that! I-I could be killed."
Ned Flanders,"God Homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. Rumba! Yea, I was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered."
Ned Flanders,"Aw, leave me out of this, Homer. Games of chance are strictly forbidden by Deuteronomy seven--"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I got a bunch, Homer, but I just don't feel right ab... Oh, Lord, what should I do?"
Ned Flanders,J-- What?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, righty-o. One betting disk please."
Ned Flanders,"How do you do it, Homer? How do you silence that little voice that says, ""Think""?"
Ned Flanders,Oh no. I-I mean common sense.
Ned Flanders,You threw it out the...
Ned Flanders,"I'll have a Shirley... no, a virgin... no, make it a children's... Oh, what the heck, you only live once. Give me a..."
Ned Flanders,White wine spritzer!
Ned Flanders,"Oh my goodness, Homer. Wake up!"
Ned Flanders,"Look at this place! We must have really painted the town last night. I have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and I don't remember a thing!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I did it! I conquered my fears and I made up for a lot of lost livin'. And I owe it all to the Homer Simpson program."
Ned Flanders,Here comes that vomit again.
Ned Flanders,"Mm-hm, I'm workin' on that."
Ned Flanders,I okeley dokely shmokely do!
Ned Flanders,"Homer! The bad news, ladies, is we already have wives."
Ned Flanders,Ginger's my wife.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelettes?"
Ned Flanders,"What are we gonna do, Homer? My kids are gonna be traumatized! And then there's Maude. And then there's Maude!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, do something! This is all your fault. You and your stupid program."
Ned Flanders,How are we going to get outta this mess in an honorable and decent--
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, nuts."
Ned Flanders,Oh no!
Ned Flanders,Drederick Tatum!
Ned Flanders,"For the last time, no!"
Ned Flanders,Will you shut up?
Ned Flanders,What's the occasion?
Ned Flanders,Homer!
Ned Flanders,"Uh, do I have to be gang-probed?"
Ned Flanders,What did the aliens look like?
Ned Flanders,"I don't want to be a Panicky Pete, but it's Sunday and I haven't been to church yet."
Ned Flanders,"Well, not, not my cup of..."
Ned Flanders,I can't believe it. We're actually in the winning locker room!
Ned Flanders,I suppose I do take Maude for granted.
Ned Flanders,"Aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. How can we sabotage his labor of love?"
Ned Flanders,"You know, with all the energy we're puttin' into this sabotage thing, we coulda written sonnets for our wives, or learned to tango, or lovingly restored one of those antique..."
Ned Flanders,"Whew, well, at least I got a hunk of Moe's hair."
Ned Flanders,"Leapin' Lazarus! Is this what passes for eternal rest these days? Rod, go get Daddy his buryin' shovel."
Ned Flanders,Not so deep the Lord can't find him... and judge him.
Ned Flanders,"Excuse me, Reverend? It's, ah, hard to hear you with those fans goin'."
Ned Flanders,"Hi-diddly-ho, paradise dwellers!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh Adam, you're too kind."
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho-ho-ho, please. You're gonna give me a swelled head. I just stopped by to see if you needed anything."
Ned Flanders,"You got it, Eve."
Ned Flanders,There you go.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'd better skedaddle. Oh, there's one more weensy little thing -- you see that tree over there?"
Ned Flanders,"I hate to be a bossy Betty, but I have to forbid you to eat its fruit."
Ned Flanders,What the dickens?!
Ned Flanders,"Eve, did you taste of the forbidden fruit?"
Ned Flanders,"Doggone it, Eve, I think you'd better hightail it outta this Garden!"
Ned Flanders,You heard me.
Ned Flanders,Vamoose!
Ned Flanders,"So! This is how you repay me, Adam!"
Ned Flanders,"And after I created my fingers to the bone for you I... My unicorn! Oh, what have they done to you, Gary?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, shut up. You are so banished."
Ned Flanders,Homer!
Ned Flanders,I said Homer!
Ned Flanders,God... bless him!
Ned Flanders,What the flood?!
Ned Flanders,"Maude, it's a miracle! The Lord has drowned the wicked and spared the righteous!"
Ned Flanders,Looks like Heaven's easier to get into than Arizona State.
Ned Flanders,"Well, hi-diddly..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, this goes right into the old poor box."
Ned Flanders,Everything but the opinion page! I don't need to be told what to think... by anyone living!
Ned Flanders,"Evening, neighbor. Low on funds again?"
Ned Flanders,"Now, Homer, we can't have you burglarizing us every time you've got a bill to pay."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we're not as well-off as you think. We give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. And the Leftorium's business has gone way downhill since Leftopolis moved in next door."
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho-ho, we picked those up cheap. They were evidence in a murder trial!"
Ned Flanders,We got that tip at the Chuck Garabedian Mega-Savings Seminar.
Ned Flanders,He taught us how to live a Burt Reynolds lifestyle on a Mac Davis income. We've already got tickets for his next seminar.
Ned Flanders,I think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing.
Ned Flanders,I think I'm gonna be sick.
Ned Flanders,Dang! I should've brought the camera.
Ned Flanders,Ho-ho! What a great pot party.
Ned Flanders,"Now for a regular cigarette, to make the night complete. Oh! Man, that's good."
Ned Flanders,"Ho-ho-ho! Why bother, baby? One smoke detector's enough for Mad Dog. Now let's hit the sack."
Ned Flanders,Check it out! Mad Dog's on fire!
Ned Flanders,"Ha! Ha! Ha! That's for Clydes, baby. A little fire can't hurt you."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry to break character, but these stunt pants are getting pretty toasty!"
Ned Flanders,It's not working! It just spreads the flame!
Ned Flanders,Phew.
Ned Flanders,Looks like it. Run get Daddy's exorcism tongs.
Ned Flanders,"""Discotheques,"" ""Frat Houses,"" ""Malibu."" Nothing about satellite fires!"
Ned Flanders,"Hear that, Maude? Homer's a critic."
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, that looks scrum-diddly-doodly-duddly --"
Ned Flanders,"A rude Frenchman? Well, I never!"
Ned Flanders,"You can't kill the undead, silly."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I wish. You see, that night when you hit me with your car..."
Ned Flanders,I'm making record time on this fog walk!
Ned Flanders,"Ooo, better pick up the pace."
Ned Flanders,Yeah...
Ned Flanders,I resisted these for thirty-five years! Why did I wear them today?
Ned Flanders,"Oooh, yes indeedy, Homer. Looks like they're settling in for a long stay."
Ned Flanders,"We-ell, morning, Apu. How are the little blessings?"
Ned Flanders,They can be a handful... of joy.
Ned Flanders,... They'll fill your lives with...
Ned Flanders,... can't put a price on a miracle...
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer! Can I join?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, if I were a member, we could use my rumpus room as our lair."
Ned Flanders,My rumpus room with the new bumper pool table.
Ned Flanders,I move we reconsider our club name. Make it something a little less blasphemous. After all we don't want to go to Hell.
Ned Flanders,N-No... you see...
Ned Flanders,The Chri... I-I-I don't think you understand my objection...
Ned Flanders,I've got a motorhome I never use. Maybe we should raffle it off.
Ned Flanders,Well I... Okay.
Ned Flanders,That shy little imp?
Ned Flanders,"Hi-didly-ho, Schuss in Boots."
Ned Flanders,"Well, it allows for maximum mobility."
Ned Flanders,Feels like I'm wearing nothin' at all!
Ned Flanders,"Feels like I'm wearin' nothin' at all. Nothin' at all, nothin' at all..."
Ned Flanders,"Hi-didly-ho, I..."
Ned Flanders,"Maude, come quick! The Simpsons are covered with cooties!"
Ned Flanders,"You saw ""Ben-Hur"" without me?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, that's no..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, those poor souls. What's the Christian thing to do?"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, listen, Homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers."
Ned Flanders,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you."
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, that smarts. Boys, get the alcohol-free alcohol."
Ned Flanders,"Mm-hm. That's the one! They've got a top-notch leper colony there, so we shipped 'em right off. Ooh, cost us a bundle, too. I guess we'll have an ""Imagination Christmas"" this year."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, ha, excuse me, neighbor..."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, yeah, I, I couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers."
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho, true enough. But, uh, did you have to salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again?"
Ned Flanders,"Yes, son."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, need any help, Homer?"
Ned Flanders,"Hi-diddly-ho, pedal-to-the-metal-o-philes!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I don't care for the speed, but I can't get enough of that safety gear. Helmets, roll-bars, caution flags..."
Ned Flanders,"Abso-not-ly, hot Roddy. We're up here, out of range of the crashes and the drivers' cussing."
Ned Flanders,No foot-longs!
Ned Flanders,Maude?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, thank you, Apu."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, wasn't she? Thank you, Moe. I appreciate that."
Ned Flanders,What are you saying?
Ned Flanders,You monster!
Ned Flanders,"That's nice of you Homer, but I think I'll just go to bed."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, this really isn't necessary..."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, that's my sprinkler."
Ned Flanders,I just bought that...
Ned Flanders,"Aw, Homer. You don't have to..."
Ned Flanders,"No, Homer! I just need to talk."
Ned Flanders,"I just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. I can't believe my last words to Maude were ""No foot-longs."""
Ned Flanders,"If I'd only been a gentleman and got the hot dogs myself, she'd still be here."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, you're right. I've just got to work through the grief. There's not gonna be an easy answer."
Ned Flanders,Hmm.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, it's been a hard couple of months, but I feel like I've turned a corner."
Ned Flanders,Tape?
Ned Flanders,Is this a dating video?
Ned Flanders,So that's why you maced me.
Ned Flanders,Homer!
Ned Flanders,Ewwww.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you obviously went to a lot of trouble, but dating? It just feels way too soon."
Ned Flanders,"Well, with triple word score, that's ninety! Ha-ha, I guess my luck is starting to even out."
Ned Flanders,I'm just a Q without a U.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm having second thoughts. This feels so disloyal to Maude."
Ned Flanders,You think she would?
Ned Flanders,Sherlock Holmes is a character.
Ned Flanders,"Okay, here goes nothin'."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I..."
Ned Flanders,"Mmm. Dinner was delicious, Edna, but I can't shake the feeling that you're just using me to get Principal Skinner jealous."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Diane, I've sure enjoyed chatting with you about your problems with your mother."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, well, maybe I'll call you again."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I just can't relate to the women of today, Homer. Ah, it's probably me. I'm about as exciting as a baked potato."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, I never question you... but I've been wondering if your decision to take Maude was, well, wrong... Unless this is part of your divine plan... Could you just give me some kinda sign? Anything? And after all that church chocolate I bought. Which, by the way, was gritty and had that white stuff on it. Well, I've had it."
Ned Flanders,"Eh, you boys can go with the Simpsons. I'm not going to church today."
Ned Flanders,That's right. And I may not go to church tomorrow.
Ned Flanders,"No, I'm not kidding. I am gonna sit right here and miss church. You just watch."
Ned Flanders,Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry...
Ned Flanders,"Electric guitars in church? Oh, my gosh. Some dropouts must have overpowered the Reverend!"
Ned Flanders,Ohhhhh.
Ned Flanders,"I'll be right back, boys. I'm going to go help that lady."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, that was a lovely song. It really got to me."
Ned Flanders,I-I recently lost my wife.
Ned Flanders,"No, I hear what you're saying. It's always hard to replace someone."
Ned Flanders,"Well, that, that sounds real nice, Rachel, but a... I'm a... I'm not quite..."
Ned Flanders,"Maybe we can. My name's Ned Flanders, and I'm here every week. Rain or shine."
Ned Flanders,"Jesus, is that you?"
Ned Flanders,"Ah yeah, I never shoulda had that trendy laser surgery. It was great at first, but you know, at the ten-year mark, your eyes fall out."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, hi Bart. How much this time?"
Ned Flanders,Yeah. Just answer me this: Are you holding your mooching sack?
Ned Flanders,"Bart, you're never gonna to grow up if I keep bailing you out."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, all right. But only because you haven't outed Rod and Todd."
Ned Flanders,"Actually, Homer, you and I worship the same God, so..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away."
Ned Flanders,Six months ago. You were at the funeral. You fell into the grave.
Ned Flanders,I'd see 'em sittin' on that couch all day long... just starin' at that Hollywood hogwash.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, uh, careful, boys. That arch is lookin' a little Romanesque."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, it's Neddy. I baked you a little something to ease the pain."
Ned Flanders,Did I hear my name? My ears are burnin'.
Ned Flanders,"Ah, you're busy. Catch you later, compu-tater."
Ned Flanders,"""They're Controlling Our Minds With Flu Shots?!"" I knew it. Well kids, now aren't you glad we don't believe in inoculations?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, my goodness!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, no! I could never support the black arts."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, you know... magic, fortune telling, Oriental cooking..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, no, Homer, remember? Maudie got called up to Heaven."
Ned Flanders,What?
Ned Flanders,"Why, there's my name in gold."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'll just reimburse you right n-- Wait a minute. This seems an awful lot like that movie, ""Paper Moon."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm all for rescuing the kids, but I wish you hadn't sawed off my roof."
Ned Flanders,But it's my car.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, whatever happened to the plow from your old snowplow business?"
Ned Flanders,I never had a snowplow business.
Ned Flanders,"Sure you did -- ""Mr. Plow."" You're wearin' the jacket right now!"
Ned Flanders,"Catchy song, all right. You really wrote it?"
Ned Flanders,We're trapped!
Ned Flanders,"Hm, sounds like a plan."
Ned Flanders,Homer! Wake up! The car's filling with...
Ned Flanders,Just like the one that saved Ezekiel!
Ned Flanders,Now let's go save those kids.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, that's not how it..."
Ned Flanders,We're gonna crash!
Ned Flanders,No. The church opposes them for some reason.
Ned Flanders,"Mmm-hmm. This one's fine and dandy, Roddy. It's approved by a council of Presbylutheran ministers."
Ned Flanders,"Oooh, found a new short cut?"
Ned Flanders,"We'll just see about that-- Uh-oh. Well, maybe he made a mistake-- Nope. It's airtight."
Ned Flanders,Can't let this little doozy get out.
Ned Flanders,"Jeepers, that's sugary, even for my taste."
Ned Flanders,I really hate to be a snitch.
Ned Flanders,"Well, in that case... My neighbor Homer released a radioactive ape in my house. It's ah, it's taken over the whole top floor."
Ned Flanders,"Look, if you want me to turn, just point. That w..."
Ned Flanders,Ow! It's one-way!
Ned Flanders,Ow! Now what was that for?
Ned Flanders,Ow! Ow!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, you got a tennis court."
Ned Flanders,Will do.
Ned Flanders,Son of a diddly!
Ned Flanders,...and Harry Potter and all his wizard friends went straight to hell for practicing witchcraft.
Ned Flanders,What the diddly-yo?!
Ned Flanders,Son of a diddly!
Ned Flanders,Son of a diddly!
Ned Flanders,"I didn't have a ""crush"" on her."
Ned Flanders,"No, I'm not!"
Ned Flanders,"Thank you, Homer."
Ned Flanders,It says I have cooties.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, Rachel. W-Well what do you know? We both like plain vanilla with nothing on it."
Ned Flanders,"So, uh, uh, where's your band?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, how horrible!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, my wife's passing was rough, but I think I'm finally ready to move on."
Ned Flanders,"I can hear her, Homer."
Ned Flanders,"I'd love to get together, but tomorrow I've got lifeguard duty at the baptismal pool."
Ned Flanders,My place? What would the neighbors think?
Ned Flanders,"Now wait just a Maude-gone minute, here. I'm through living in the past, and you can see for yourself."
Ned Flanders,"All right, I'll take the couch and you can have my room."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, ah, c-c-could you sleep on my side? I-I'm trying to preserve Maude's indentation."
Ned Flanders,"Ohh, no problem. A little starch will fix her right up."
Ned Flanders,"Cold, huh?"
Ned Flanders,This should keep you toasty.
Ned Flanders,"Mmm... I love chenille, don't you?"
Ned Flanders,"Mm. Well, goodnight, Maude. I mean, Maude. I mean, Rachel. I mean, Maude."
Ned Flanders,"No, n-n-no I know this is a-a-a tad unseemly, but if you'd just let me even out the back..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not over Maude at all."
Ned Flanders,"I sure appreciate you folks offering to go through Maude's things. If it were up to me, I wouldn't throw anything away."
Ned Flanders,Yea-- What?
Ned Flanders,Always do.
Ned Flanders,Oh my. The room looks so bare.
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, just a little shocked. What's that? Some kinda sorting machine?"
Ned Flanders,"Maude's old sketch book. She was quite the little artist, you know."
Ned Flanders,Here's our house... a rainbow... a white hand shaking a black hand...
Ned Flanders,"Praiseland? Rides, food, a tithing pond."
Ned Flanders,You're right.
Ned Flanders,"Maude designed a Christian amusement park. Oh, it must have been her final dream."
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh, that's a nice thought, Toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
Ned Flanders,But where do you put something that big?
Ned Flanders,"Well, what the heck. Who's ready to build an amusement park?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, it's been closed for so long... and-and I thought I could turn it into a Christian theme park."
Ned Flanders,"Now the thing is, I don't have a lot of money..."
Ned Flanders,But I...
Ned Flanders,"If you could do that, I'd make this place a shining beacon for the Lord."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, bless you, sir."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, Gipetto's workshop will make a great stable for the nativity scene."
Ned Flanders,Darn teenagers with their beer bottles.
Ned Flanders,"Well, it's been a tad harder than I thought, but I'm not complaining 'cause I work for a sweet, sweet, boss. You're our foreman, Maude."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I don't mind, but my greenback stack's gettin' kinda slack."
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh, I'm not very good at begging people for stuff."
Ned Flanders,"Well thanks, Homer."
Ned Flanders,"Morning, Kent. Our volunteers have done an amazing job getting the park ready here. We're gonna show Springfield that faith and devotion are the wildest thrill rides of all."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Maude, your dream has finally come true."
Ned Flanders,You can stop Satan with your faith.
Ned Flanders,"No, no, no, no, no, I think you're beautiful."
Ned Flanders,"Ohh, what can I get you, little Christian? How 'bout a Noah's Ark of Jellies?"
Ned Flanders,"Nope, they're all the same. Plain."
Ned Flanders,How 'bout a Maude mask?
Ned Flanders,I'm Maude. God is super!
Ned Flanders,Bye bye.
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh, you want me to stamp your hand so you can get back in?"
Ned Flanders,Whoa! Where's everyone going? What's wrong?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Maude, I turned your dream of a Christian amusement park into a bemusement park."
Ned Flanders,It is! It's a bemusement park!
Ned Flanders,"I'm sorry, sweetheart. Oh, please don't look at me like that."
Ned Flanders,It's almost like she's alive again.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, no! I can't exploit a divine manifestation."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, there's no explaining God's will, Roddy. That's like explaining how an airplane flies."
Ned Flanders,Leak in the line?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, no! This isn't a devine miracle. Everyone's just gettin' goofy from the gas."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, ah, folks, I've just discovered something about this statue that uh, may disappoint you. You see..."
Ned Flanders,"Hello, Gas Company? How poisonous is your gas?... Wow. But-- Eh, but I'm talkin', you know, about outdoors with plenty of ventilation that... How could that be worse?... Okay, permanent brain damage, or just temporary?... I see."
Ned Flanders,I've gotta close Praiseland down. Someone could get hurt.
Ned Flanders,Nooo!!!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, your hair's grown back real nice."
Ned Flanders,"How 'bout I explain it to you over a cup of coffee. That is, if you're willing to give me another shot."
Ned Flanders,I'm sure.
Ned Flanders,"So, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer!"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer, I need to ask ya a favor. My baby sitter canceled and I got tickets to a Christian rock concert."
Ned Flanders,"It's gonna be one wholesome evening. So, do you think Marge could take care of rowdy Roddy and Typhoon Todd?"
Ned Flanders,Would you mind watching the kids? I'm kinda in a pickle here.
Ned Flanders,"So, did you boys have a good time?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, I never heard a preacher use the ""m-f"" word so many times. Anyway, thanks again."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Roddy, he's not runnin' a day care center."
Ned Flanders,So you are running a day care center?
Ned Flanders,"Well, I sure would. It would give the boys a place to go after school."
Ned Flanders,Me? Okay.
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, b-but my hands are up."
Ned Flanders,All right officer.
Ned Flanders,What the...?!
Ned Flanders,You're using my table saw to violate a court order?
Ned Flanders,"Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. And it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
Ned Flanders,Wow.
Ned Flanders,"Playing a prankeroo, eh?"
Ned Flanders,"Greetings from Nedily Space Center on Cape Flandaveral. We noticed your sky-ro-technics and thought we'd join in. Ooh, looks like a perfect landing!"
Ned Flanders,"It's kind of you to offer, Mr. Burns, but buzz around town is that you're, well, evil."
Ned Flanders,"My Satan sense is tingling! Into the root cellar, boys!"
Ned Flanders,Maybe never.
Ned Flanders,"Well, Christmas is coming, huh?"
Ned Flanders,Homer!
Ned Flanders,"Well, Ginger, sure is, uh, um, neat that you managed to hunt me down."
Ned Flanders,"Oh Lord, I know my new wife is a little more... ""peppermint"" than you're used to. But, uh, I know you'd want me to honor my sacred vows, so I will."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we've got a real shower upstairs."
Ned Flanders,Me and the boys made you breakfast in bed. It's the best darn diddly way to start your first Flanders day!
Ned Flanders,"Whoops. Watch the swears, Honey Bear. We don't use the ""I"" word in this house."
Ned Flanders,Ooh. Who wants to hold Mommy's hair?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, that's not you talkin'. That's the honey-mustard dressing!"
Ned Flanders,This is going right to the orphanage.
Ned Flanders,"Come on, boys."
Ned Flanders,Hi-O-diddily-ysseus!
Ned Flanders,I'll say. I'd really like to go out and get the mail.
Ned Flanders,Well... I don't have one from you!
Ned Flanders,Bring it in!
Ned Flanders,"Now, throughout history, when people get wood, they'll think of Trojans."
Ned Flanders,"Heaven and earth... Where were we? Oh, now I'm lost."
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly-hey, Homer!"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, i-i-it's me, Ned."
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, of course He could... but then again... Wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle."
Ned Flanders,"Well, luckily, I've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers."
Ned Flanders,I guess that could be arranged.
Ned Flanders,...The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. The End.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I know he's wishin' you'd sign his petition...to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana."
Ned Flanders,"Well, okay... I, I guess it would go something like this: All right, Simpson, you're under arrest, see?"
Ned Flanders,Thank you so much.
Ned Flanders,THE CAMPTOWN LADIES SING THIS SONG...
Ned Flanders,"DOO-DA, DOO-DA..."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, hey, now hold on there. The nice people want to hear the real words."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, let's just take it from the top."
Ned Flanders,THE CAMPTOWN LADIES SING THIS SONG...
Ned Flanders,"DOO-DA, DOO-DA..."
Ned Flanders,That's better.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, those are not the words!"
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, I've been singing your praises all day. Marge said we could have choir practice in your house tonight."
Ned Flanders,"Here's a preview. GOD SAID TO NOAH / BUILD YOURSELF AN ARK-Y ARK-Y / ANIMALS CAME ON BY ONES AND TWOSIES, TWOSIES / ELEPHANTS AND KANGAROOSIES - ROOSIES..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, nice work, Inspector Find-It. Did you catch the thief?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I sure didn't."
Ned Flanders,Nobody.
Ned Flanders,Okely-dokely.
Ned Flanders,"I'm with you, Homer."
Ned Flanders,"I don't know, neighboreenos, I'm all for Halloween fun, but a séance sounds a little PG-13."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I do miss the Mrs..."
Ned Flanders,Maude! You still look as pretty as the day I buried you.
Ned Flanders,"Say Homer, I was, uh, I was wondering if I could borrow that chainsaw you, uh, stole from me."
Ned Flanders,No problem! Discover okay?
Ned Flanders,"Okay, here's my Amex."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer!"
Ned Flanders,"Hate to be a needy Neddy, but, uh, could you do me a favor...?"
Ned Flanders,"Boy, that's Jim Dandy roof candy! I'd love to come over some time and watch that Church Channel."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you'd win that bet. Seems like I'm spending all my money on religious pay-per-view. Or as I like to call it, ""pray-per-view."""
Ned Flanders,And bless your humble home.
Ned Flanders,"Well, cock-a-diddily-doo! What a Marge-alicious way to start my Flander-rific day."
Ned Flanders,"Well boys, good thing we brought the eye soap."
Ned Flanders,"Shop o' the mornin', Homer! Just call me ""Mall"" Flanders."
Ned Flanders,You betcha! This kiosk sells personalized movies. I had one made starring little Rod.
Ned Flanders,"Now Rainier, I really don't think it's right to sell these Playdude centerfolds."
Ned Flanders,"Well, aren't you a super-duper recouper."
Ned Flanders,"Praise the Lord, my seat has scored!"
Ned Flanders,You betcha. It's a nice break from the male sports I usually watch.
Ned Flanders,"Oh sure, speed walking, ballroom dancing, rhythmic gymnastics, extreme choir..."
Ned Flanders,"Gosh, fifty thousand dollars? I'm donating this whole check to ""Bibles for Belgians."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, hot dog!"
Ned Flanders,That cuts the mustard with me.
Ned Flanders,The steering wheel is a giant onion ring!
Ned Flanders,"Well, whatever I've got I owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. Plus a little prayer now and then."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, please don't sue the church. I'm asking you as your friend and neighbor."
Ned Flanders,Okely dokely.
Ned Flanders,Why do I always give in to him?
Ned Flanders,It's his skull. It's hypnotic!
Ned Flanders,"And Rev, you'll be bunkin' with me!"
Ned Flanders,"Where you going, Reverend? The town's that way. Reverend? You're goin' the wrong way!"
Ned Flanders,"No, no, you're lying! You're lying! What makes you lie?"
Ned Flanders,They've broken every commandment except one!
Ned Flanders,That's it. The whole shebang.
Ned Flanders,"Lord, this town may have turned its back on you, but not the Flanderses. Wherever we are, you'll have your church. Are you with me, boys?"
Ned Flanders,Speaking in tongues. What great kids.
Ned Flanders,"Okay boys, this is it. The end of this sinful little suburb."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, I've got two of every animal. But only males -- I don't want any hanky-panky. Hey, hey, hey, cut that out!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, Sea Captain, looks like you and I are sailin' solo tonight."
Ned Flanders,"Well, guess I might as well head back to my store. I've got a date with some twins: my state and federal tax forms."
Ned Flanders,"Form of business? Sole proprietorship. ""Owner's marital status?"" Happily married... to a dead woman."
Ned Flanders,"Mm hmm! Open as a tomb on Easter. Now, what can I ding dong diddily do for ya?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I should say not. I gave up on L.A. when those TV people made that poor nun fly. All those Puerto Ricans lookin' up her dress. That's not right."
Ned Flanders,Do I! No I don't. But I can have 'em here by Tuesday.
Ned Flanders,"Why, you are gorgeous."
Ned Flanders,"I sure do. You're the most important person in the world, because you're my customer."
Ned Flanders,I'm as real as the nose on your face.
Ned Flanders,"Well, it looks good... and it sounds pretty too."
Ned Flanders,"A woman askin' a man out? Well, well why not. And maybe I'll eat my steak with a spoon."
Ned Flanders,What the...? That's a pseu-diddily-eudonym.
Ned Flanders,WELL I'VE GOT A DATE WITH A GIRL WITH NO NAME / IT SURE FEELS GOOD TO BE BACK IN THE GAME / AT DESSERT MAYBE I CAN ASK HER HER NAME / 'CAUSE I CAN'T PRAY FOR HER WITHOUT THE RIGHT NAME...
Ned Flanders,I've got a date with a movie star?!
Ned Flanders,Psst! Homer!
Ned Flanders,I need your advice. It's about a lady.
Ned Flanders,"No, it's Sara Sloane. I have a date with her tonight."
Ned Flanders,Yep. Why would that Twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me?
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, that's very encouraging but I can't date a movie star. I'm no Arthur Miller or Lyle Lovett."
Ned Flanders,"... Rod says ""Marco,"" and darn it if Todd doesn't say ""Polo"" right back! Oh, listen to me just running my gums about my kids. You're probably bored silly."
Ned Flanders,Huh.
Ned Flanders,Heaven's gate! I'm gonna be tastin' you on my mustache for a week.
Ned Flanders,"Yep, we occupy that useless mass of land between Los Angeles and New York. Called America!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh now, if someone took the time to press that little button, this is the least I can do."
Ned Flanders,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This movie's turning into Sponge Bob No-Pants!"
Ned Flanders,"Sir, there's no reason Sara needs to do this scene in the altogether."
Ned Flanders,Yep. Now all we gotta do is turn that woman into a fella and that kiss into a game of Scrabble.
Ned Flanders,"Well, that's uh, very interesting..."
Ned Flanders,Mm-hmm. I haven't felt this good since we stole the 2000 election.
Ned Flanders,The paparazzi! I thought we fooled them with our Cher-crow.
Ned Flanders,I'll have you know she pays full price for all her watercraft!
Ned Flanders,Exact-a-tically-tacally!
Ned Flanders,No way! I won't even eat vegetables over two inches long.
Ned Flanders,"So anyway, uh, your movie's wrapping up soon. I guess you'll be headin' out on the first bus to the airport. If you ride with a friend, you can save twenty bucks!"
Ned Flanders,Ned Flanders in Tinseltown?
Ned Flanders,Can I call you Jim?
Ned Flanders,"Well, I can't see the harm."
Ned Flanders,Noooo!
Ned Flanders,"Well, I..."
Ned Flanders,Noooo!
Ned Flanders,"Sara, I'm sorry, but I can't move to Hollywood. Heck, even Dollywood's too far out for me. Too many people appreciating it ironically."
Ned Flanders,"Forgive my language, but I am one happy camper!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, what seems to be the problem, officer?"
Ned Flanders,Sure is nice to be shopping for a woman again. The last thing I bought for a lady was a casket.
Ned Flanders,Well of course. Wait a minute. This is to adopt two of your kids.
Ned Flanders,"Hop to it, honey! If we get to the Pops concert early, we can give up our seats to some old people."
Ned Flanders,"Sweetie, that's not the kind of dress you wear outdoors... or indoors... or in a dirty dream."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Siegfried and Roy create a lot of illusions, but I doubt their girlfriends dress like that."
Ned Flanders,"Sara, I hate to say it, but your top's upstaging the Pops!"
Ned Flanders,"Sara, I love ya, but I get the feeling you're just... not a Ned-head tonight. Is something wrong?"
Ned Flanders,"Se... well, that's a mighty big... kettle of... premarital... uh, doodly..."
Ned Flanders,This is quite a dil-diddly-lemma. I better talk this over with the big man.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, Sara wants us to have S-E-X."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm not sure I want to do it. I mean ""who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?"" You know, the cow being me."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I consulted my bible and found some verses supporting what you want to do."
Ned Flanders,And a lot of verses against it.
Ned Flanders,It says a man should make restitution if he eats his neighbor's grain. And that's good enough for me.
Ned Flanders,That's what Maude used to say.
Ned Flanders,"Well, and you will. Right after the wedding."
Ned Flanders,Uh hmm. That's right. I'm like Baskin Robbins. You get one free taste then you gotta buy the scoop.
Ned Flanders,"I love you, too. And I always will. But unlike the Bible, I guess this isn't gonna have a happy ending."
Ned Flanders,I'm sorry.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, darn the luck. That sounds like the Lupus Fun Run."
Ned Flanders,I bet we woulda lasted twice that long.
Ned Flanders,You know it's the darndest thing -- women love you when you've dated a movie star.
Ned Flanders,Why don't you pound that sign into your own lawn?
Ned Flanders,And it wouldn't hurt you to put up some curtains.
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, that's quite a thing-a-ma-jigsaw. But it looks like you're missin' a piece."
Ned Flanders,I walked right into that one.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, Homer, I think you want your house, next door."
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, writing a new Christmas carol?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, the Bible says it's fun to do stuff together."
Ned Flanders,"THERE'S A STRANGER IN THE MANGER AND HIS NAME IS LOVE Take it, Homer!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus."
Ned Flanders,"Why thank you, Homer. It's a popsicle in my favorite flavor -- plain."
Ned Flanders,"THEN I DOUBT YOU'LL LIKE NED FLANDERS / OR HIS CREEPY LITTLE OFFSPRING, ROD AND TODD..."
Ned Flanders,"I got your letter, Jesus and I'm coming as fast as I can."
Ned Flanders,"Well, the folks at the senior center sure will love that peach tree we planted."
Ned Flanders,"Sin of pride, Roddy."
Ned Flanders,Sin of regret.
Ned Flanders,The house is slightly askew! To the panic room!
Ned Flanders,Scared of what? All the funny camp songs we're gonna sing? WE'LL BE SAFE INSIDE OUR FORTRESS WHEN THEY COME / WE'LL BE SAFE FROM CREEPS AND KILLERS WHEN THEY COME / UNLESS THEY HAVE A BLOWTORCH / OR A POISON GAS INJECTOR / THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN WHEN THEY COME!
Ned Flanders,Of course I am. They were bigger than Jesus! But your boy went Yoko and broke up my collection.
Ned Flanders,Oh our courts aren't fit to keep children in line. The only thing they're good for is telling women what to do with their bodies. What these boys need is adult supervision.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I did finish first in the Walk For The Cure... of homosexuality."
Ned Flanders,Ahhhh...
Ned Flanders,"I'm dying! And there's Heaven. But who's that? Confucius? And Milton Berle? Boy, have I been barkin' up the wrong tree."
Ned Flanders,"Oh well, you snooze you lose. But uh, can I have my photo albums back?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, the hobos sure will appreciate our old clothes and lima beans."
Ned Flanders,"Gee, looks like this town has a good Sam log-jam."
Ned Flanders,That was Led Zeppelin.
Ned Flanders,"Well, maybe just a tad, Todd."
Ned Flanders,"One problem at a time, boy."
Ned Flanders,HERE COME SANDWICHES / HERE COME SANDWICHES / RIGHT DOWN BOOZY BUM LANE...
Ned Flanders,BROTHER NED'S GOT CHEESE ON BREAD / AND A SIDE ORDER OF SHAME...
Ned Flanders,Where the H-E-C-K is everybody?
Ned Flanders,Wha?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, for the love of puppies."
Ned Flanders,That Homer just burns my waffles!
Ned Flanders,Pain is the cleanser! Pain is the cleanser!
Ned Flanders,"Why, I'll give you a jump, I'll rotate your tires, I'll even fold up that map for you. I know they can be a dickens of a doozy..."
Ned Flanders,That tears it. I'll show Homer. I'm gonna be the nicest man this world has ever seen.
Ned Flanders,"I said ""man,"" not ""man-God."" Keep your pants on."
Ned Flanders,"Here you go, Principal Skinner, Mrs. Skinner."
Ned Flanders,"My angle is givin' in this world, livin' in the next."
Ned Flanders,"Well, actually, I picked up some extra cash renting out my house to a fraternity."
Ned Flanders,Stop!
Ned Flanders,"Friends, what Homer did was wrong. But I've been thinking -- maybe I was just as wrong to give you those gifts."
Ned Flanders,"""And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people..."
Ned Flanders,"It'd be my pleasure, Homer!"
Ned Flanders,That is one bitchin' bike!
Ned Flanders,"Lighten up, Roddy."
Ned Flanders,"Hey Marge, you look like you could use a nice big stud... detector."
Ned Flanders,"They were two for one at Krusty Home Depot, so I got an extra one for you guys!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, some say being thoughtful is old-fashioned. If so, then I guess I'm just a cave man. If they existed, which they didn't!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess it wouldn't kill me to let you in."
Ned Flanders,"Well, he's got me there."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, please make Homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. Oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts I had about the girl on the raisin box."
Ned Flanders,Huh?
Ned Flanders,Advice? Just call me Ann Flanders!
Ned Flanders,"Oh, and another thing..."
Ned Flanders,...and a backrub can just be a backrub. It doesn't have to lead to adult situations.
Ned Flanders,"Now now, remember why we're here: to celebrate Jasper's birthday."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, thank God. You're finally fighting your demons."
Ned Flanders,"Well, that's good too, I guess."
Ned Flanders,"Huh, credit card bill seems a little chunky this month."
Ned Flanders,Let's see what's goin' on vis a vis the VISA.
Ned Flanders,"Well this is one dilly of a daily, Lisa. Can't wait for tomorrow's!"
Ned Flanders,Concussion... diddily... hemorrhage... doodily... injury... bodily...
Ned Flanders,"Come on, Ned. Just because you foresaw Dr. Hibbert's death doesn't mean you can see into the future. It was just a sinister co-inky-dink."
Ned Flanders,"Just wriggle loose. I'll catch ya, li'l critter!"
Ned Flanders,What the Family Circus? A second premonition came to fruition.
Ned Flanders,"Lord, why have you given me these unholy visions of doom?"
Ned Flanders,Well I didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I can foretell people's deaths!"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, you die eating a submarine sandwich."
Ned Flanders,Country parmesan.
Ned Flanders,'Cause I had a vision of myself... shooting your father.
Ned Flanders,"Don't worry, sweetie. I am not going to kill your father."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, please, don't tempt the gods. I-I mean God! There's-there's one God! Only one! Well, sometimes there's three."
Ned Flanders,Quit whackin' my barrel!
Ned Flanders,You leave me no choice!
Ned Flanders,"I was supposed to shoot you, but I didn't! I changed the future!"
Ned Flanders,What have I done? I've changed the future for the worse.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, stay away from the nuclear plant."
Ned Flanders,But you're gonna kill us all...
Ned Flanders,I gotta find Homer -- he's gonna blow up the whole town!
Ned Flanders,Homer! Homer!
Ned Flanders,Homer! Do not press the core destruct button!
Ned Flanders,Press... destruct... button.
Ned Flanders,Don't do it! Don't do it! You'll kill everyone!
Ned Flanders,Do it! Do it! Kill everyone!
Ned Flanders,Must... kill... best friend.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, fall backward!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you stupid son-of-a..."
Ned Flanders,I just told the natives they were havin' sex the wrong way!
Ned Flanders,"Marge, you know I thought I was Springfield's wing ding king, but uh, you make my chicken look like cock-a-diddily doo doo."
Ned Flanders,"You know I was gonna enter this here Ovenfresh Bakeoff... but up against you, I wouldn't have a Hindu's chance in Heaven."
Ned Flanders,"Well, my Roddy told a joke about an octopus and a set of bagpipes -- and the punchline implied that they fornicated!"
Ned Flanders,"Let's see... ""Get Bent."" Well, the only thing that could mean is kneel down and pray. We'll take the whole box. Get bent, everyone!"
Ned Flanders,"I can't run, I'm wearing flip-flops!"
Ned Flanders,"Help me out, Homer. My little Roddy needs his insulin. Breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing."
Ned Flanders,I don't claim to be the perfect neighbor...
Ned Flanders,I was just telling him how brave he is to worship a false god.
Ned Flanders,Well where's your super-team now?
Ned Flanders,But the infinite beauty-- / But the Bible says--
Ned Flanders,Why don't you just call out for Hawk Man?
Ned Flanders,"Hello, neighborino to the north. I sure like the cut of your gibberish."
Ned Flanders,They warned me Satan would be attractive. Let's go.
Ned Flanders,Anyone want some coffee for the ride back?
Ned Flanders,"Not that convenience store crap, is it? Because I don't feed that to my dogs."
Ned Flanders,"No, no, it's home-brewed."
Ned Flanders,"Careful, it's hotter than a Fox News weather skank."
Ned Flanders,"Here, let me wrap this wet towel around your head to cool you off."
Ned Flanders,One hundred dollars and fifty cents!
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, I don't believe we've ever met."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'll just call you friend. Here's your tape... friend."
Ned Flanders,"There's nothing but filth on TV. But with this new video camera, we can make our own entertainment!"
Ned Flanders,"Now boys, we're gonna film the world's first and some would say best murder mystery -- the story of Cain and Abel!"
Ned Flanders,"Your mouth is hopin' for a soapin', boy! Now stop asking silly questions and go kill your brother!"
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, thanks for turnin' the church into a He-without-cineplex."
Ned Flanders,"Boys, I just talked to God. He's vacuuming Heaven to get it ready for when dead people show up. And He'd like you both to render a sacrifice."
Ned Flanders,"Now I must bury my son, while you wander the earth forever, with the mark of evil upon your face."
Ned Flanders,"Now, there's no need to actually whip 'em. We can put the sound in later."
Ned Flanders,But who'd know the difference?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I-I guess you'd rather see a film about a liberal European wizard school, or the latest sexcapade of Miss Ashley Judd!"
Ned Flanders,"Yeah. I made a great film, but I'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. I'm like Michael Moore, except I'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and God loves me. I just wish I could find some way to spread my message."
Ned Flanders,Are you even listening to me?!
Ned Flanders,Wait a minute -- you've got a medium and I've got a message. Maybe God brought us together for a reason.
Ned Flanders,"""So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them... Never again shall there be a flood to destroy the Earth. I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between God and man."" Thank you."
Ned Flanders,"Well now Roddy, the Lord wouldn't let us die this way."
Ned Flanders,"Well, we could use a new H.Q. for the Springfield Philharmonic. They're playing Gustav Mahler in abject squalor."
Ned Flanders,Hey Homer!
Ned Flanders,Yes... but my mower can't get much lower!
Ned Flanders,I was wrong!
Ned Flanders,"Sorry, Homer. You'll have to call me a Ray-theist, 'cause I don't believe I saw him."
Ned Flanders,"Gee, I thought my vision was perfect. And here I was, worshiping false eyeballs."
Ned Flanders,"Uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, well, well, looks like someone's having a pre-Rapture party."
Ned Flanders,"Howdy, Homer. You here for a viewin' of my shampooin'?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, sorry, but I promised to rewind videotapes for the poor."
Ned Flanders,"All right, neighbor, I'll baby-sit."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, so I can't see my own shrinky dink."
Ned Flanders,"Oh-uh-uh... sorry Maggie, that's something to collect, not enjoy. It's one of my Humble figurines."
Ned Flanders,"He scampered out of Parade magazine and into my knick-knack nook, and uh, well his little buddies soon followed."
Ned Flanders,"You like 'em, huh? Come on, I'll show you the other three hundred."
Ned Flanders,How could this have... oh.
Ned Flanders,"Boys, enough of your shenanigans. It's bedtime."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I can't take money from a neighbor. Although, business at the Leftorium's been pretty slow since that big chain store came to town."
Ned Flanders,"Well, it might be fun to be a landlord. Landfella -- there's only one Lord!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'd love to help you out, but you do have to be over eighteen."
Ned Flanders,"Wait, this is my license!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I do appreciate that you've got a cashier's check... Now, do you have any pets?"
Ned Flanders,"You poor thing! I've heard about those robes -- flapping everywhere. Girls, welcome to your very own Ned and Breakfast."
Ned Flanders,"Here's your room, ladies. You can catch some Z's while you earn those degrees."
Ned Flanders,"Well, thank you."
Ned Flanders,I got phi beta cappuccinos for Ned's pre-meds!
Ned Flanders,That's odd.
Ned Flanders,I coulda sworn I just heard someone shriek my name.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, that's better."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Mel, they're swell."
Ned Flanders,You soft-core sophomores took advantage of my trustful nature. And sullied the internet by putting pornography on it!
Ned Flanders,Get out!
Ned Flanders,The whole town is laughing at me behind my back. I guess you're the only real friend I have.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, is this true?"
Ned Flanders,"The Bible says ""cast your bread upon the waters."" But all I got was a bunch of soggy bread."
Ned Flanders,"Don't say it, Homer. This is not the time."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Toddy, you know how I said our friends are like the Canaanites? Today I realized they're more like the Midianites."
Ned Flanders,I wish we lived in a place more like the America of yesteryear that only exists in the brains of us Republicans.
Ned Flanders,"""Made in Humbleton, PA."" I don't usually make big life decisions based on things stamped on things that I bought at a garage sale. But corndog it boys, it's time for a change!"
Ned Flanders,The Flanders family has pulled up stakes. You have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.
Ned Flanders,"Boys, we're home!"
Ned Flanders,This town is sweeter than a cake made of pie. Even the dogs curb themselves.
Ned Flanders,Can I start yesterday?
Ned Flanders,"Get rid of Dr. Fuzzenstein? Why, I couldn't dream of thinking about considering..."
Ned Flanders,I'll see what I can do.
Ned Flanders,You know what? I'm not gonna. My mustache has the right to life -- it's my body and my choice!
Ned Flanders,Homer? What are you doing here?
Ned Flanders,Why? So you can make me a laughingstock again?
Ned Flanders,"Well, that is true. In fact--"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, that's really touching. But my boys and I are trying to make a new start, and the people here are a little more my cup of..."
Ned Flanders,"That tears it! Boys, put on your goody two-shoes. We're moving back to Springfield!"
Ned Flanders,Now you've got a pen pal.
Ned Flanders,"So you see Mr. Roberts, I really would like my house back."
Ned Flanders,"Now coach, I've tried to be Christian and respectful, but I guess I'm just gonna have to point out your two hundred thousand dollar check bounced. Legally, I still own this house."
Ned Flanders,Homer!
Ned Flanders,Did you steal the organ from the church?!
Ned Flanders,"Well, you've gotta take it back!"
Ned Flanders,It sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. Mind if I waggle my finger a little bit?
Ned Flanders,"Marge, this calls for an emergency meeting of the church's spiritual council. To Stuckey's!"
Ned Flanders,Bart and Homer can't go Catholic! The Romans have been separate from us since the Schism of Lourdes in 1573. And that was about our holy right to come to church with wet hair. Which we've since abolished.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! Once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. Like the Jews with their snippity-snip."
Ned Flanders,"Back off, you servants of the Holy See!"
Ned Flanders,He's right. Can't we all get together and concentrate on our real enemies: monogamous gays and stem cells?
Ned Flanders,My pleasure.
Ned Flanders,It's seven a.m. What are they cock-a-doodily-doin'?
Ned Flanders,"Okily-dokily, here's some French roast, now I'll go make toast."
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, why the sour puss? Didja chugalug a skunky Snapple?"
Ned Flanders,Really? Do you mind if I bring my boys over so she can infect Rod and Todd? Then there'll be a pox on both our houses!
Ned Flanders,"Au contraire, man with no hair! You see, Rod and Todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time!"
Ned Flanders,"You betcha! In fact, some parents have been known to hold ""pox parties,"" so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please."
Ned Flanders,"Well, they might. But you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors..."
Ned Flanders,"Hi-diddly-ho! There's ""no bot"" like a robot!"
Ned Flanders,Ow! My Flander-doodles!
Ned Flanders,Please change me back! This bumble bee has developed an unhealthy obsession with me.
Ned Flanders,I don't want flowers. I am a flower!
Ned Flanders,"Christ is born, who's on my horn?"
Ned Flanders,You want me to deliver the Christmas sermon? I feel like I'm born again again!
Ned Flanders,"Don't be nervous, Ned. You've practiced this so many times in the shower."
Ned Flanders,Aagh! Paper cut!
Ned Flanders,"My LP of ""Dreamcoat!"""
Ned Flanders,HOW I LOVE MY COAT OF MANY COLORS / IT WAS RED AND YELLOW AND GREEN AND BROWN / AND SCARLET AND BLACK AND OCHRE AND PEACH / AND RUBY AND OLIVE AND VIOLET AND FAWN...
Ned Flanders,...AND LILAC AND GOLD AND CHOCOLATE AND MAUVE / AND CREAM AND CRIMSON AND SILVER AND ROSE / AND AZURE AND LEMON AND RUSSET AND GREY...
Ned Flanders,AND PURPLE AND WHITE AND PINK AND ORANGE / AND RED AND YELLOW AND GREEN AND BROWN / SCARLET AND BLACK AND OCHRE AND PEACH...
Ned Flanders,This is my favorite kind of surprise: mild!
Ned Flanders,"Hey Marge, I don't I don't really want a computer. You know all those complete strangers Googling each other. Makes my flesh crawl."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, we could do a little Quid Pro for the Kay-Pro. The left-handed convention is in town, and as the owner of Springfield's largest southpaw shop, I just gotta be there. Could you uh, nanny-goat my kid-diddly-ids?"
Ned Flanders,Woo hoo!
Ned Flanders,"I'm so glad you're watchin' the boys, Marge. Our last babysitter let 'em watch ""Comedy Central"", now Rod makes me check the closet every night for Rita Rudner."
Ned Flanders,"Here are the numbers for the police, fire, ambulance, poison control, burn clinic, and people nearby with Rod and Todd's blood type."
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, wow, it's the Big Unit himself, Randy Johnson! You've fanned more men than Salome!"
Ned Flanders,Do you have one for a mailman?
Ned Flanders,"Um, one box?"
Ned Flanders,Hiya Marge. Rod and Todd in the land of nod?
Ned Flanders,"Hey, you're welcome to see the dynamic duo any time."
Ned Flanders,Hey Homer! Sneakin' kisses from the Missus?
Ned Flanders,What are you doing?! You're gonna get hurt!
Ned Flanders,"Well, well. Look at my dull-eyed angels."
Ned Flanders,What's this?
Ned Flanders,"It's the ripcord from a Band-Aid wrapper! Call me Ned Zeppelin, but is one of my boys abrased and contused?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I think it's about time you boys get to bed."
Ned Flanders,"And so we don't have another disaster, you crawl up those steps!"
Ned Flanders,I just can't. They're all I've got since that sad day when Maude found eternal happiness.
Ned Flanders,"Well, their mascot is a kneepad wearing a helmet... why not?"
Ned Flanders,"I'm not Ned, I'm a friendly dog. Oh, I'm not a good liar. I did come here to check on the... where's Rod?"
Ned Flanders,He chipped a tooth! How will he bite Wheat Thins? How?
Ned Flanders,I don't want you watching my boys ever again!
Ned Flanders,"WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE GYM / I'LL MAKE IT SAFE AGAIN / WHEN PLAYTIME IS A SAFE TIME, EVERYBODY WINS..."
Ned Flanders,NOW I'LL LAY DOWN SOME ASTRO TURF / SO THEY DON'T SCRAPE THEIR N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-KNEES...
Ned Flanders,"Well, we're gonna do what every kid your age likes to do: look at bread."
Ned Flanders,The 'N' word!
Ned Flanders,"Uno?! That's a gateway game to pinochle. All diddily aside, boys, what is it about her you miss so much?"
Ned Flanders,"Roddy, get down! You're gonna fall!"
Ned Flanders,"Rod... You can do it, boy! With God on your side, you can't fail!"
Ned Flanders,Evolution?!
Ned Flanders,"Lord, with you watching over me I shall feel no pain."
Ned Flanders,"Only ten dollars to paint my curb like a common whore? Well I'm happy to pay for a three-digit spray! Tell you what, I'll give you another hundred if you paint my garage!"
Ned Flanders,I'll throw in some Christian comic books!
Ned Flanders,Please! Somebody take 'em!
Ned Flanders,"Hi-dilly ho, Simpsons!"
Ned Flanders,"Wait, wait, ho-hold the phone there Homer..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, fine. Take the cut."
Ned Flanders,"Tell you what -- if we turn around, it'll feel like we're at the front of the line!"
Ned Flanders,"You're leavin' already? We, we haven't even gotten in yet."
Ned Flanders,Excuse me. How can you put up an exhibit on the origin of man and not have one mention of the Bible?
Ned Flanders,My most cherished beliefs -- a myth?
Ned Flanders,No one was ever a monkey! Everything is what it was and always will be! God put us here and that's that!
Ned Flanders,"Um, that was God disguised as a stork."
Ned Flanders,There's no such thing as storks! It's all God!
Ned Flanders,Stop praying to that stork!
Ned Flanders,They're telling people we're descended from a pack of apes. Even though there's nothing about it in the Bible!
Ned Flanders,We want you to teach alternative theories to Darwinian evolution.
Ned Flanders,As familiar as it's proper to be.
Ned Flanders,As sure as I am that Jesus hates Hip Hop!
Ned Flanders,As a matter... Homer...
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm tryin' to..."
Ned Flanders,"Will you shut your yap, ya big monkey-faced gorilla!!!"
Ned Flanders,"You win, Lisa."
Ned Flanders,"Let's go, boys. Your poor old Popsicle's been licked."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I wish this world would evolve a few more kids like you, Lisa."
Ned Flanders,What say we take our worthy adversary out for a hot fudge fun-day?
Ned Flanders,Whaa -- ?
Ned Flanders,"Hi-diddily-ho, mob-areenos!"
Ned Flanders,"I... uh... I got your phone bill in my mail by mistake... and, uh... I'll just pay it."
Ned Flanders,"Hiddily-ho, Blobareeno."
Ned Flanders,"Marge, I hate to interrupt the ol' solilo-diddly-iloquy, but I just want to thank you for your early Christmas card."
Ned Flanders,Isn't this your posse on this glossy?
Ned Flanders,"Oh I don't mean to cause Gil ill will, but still..."
Ned Flanders,"Marge, I've never seen you like this before."
Ned Flanders,"Tonight's G-rated gem is a silent film from my favorite year -- yester! And while you enjoy this quiet riot, I'll be slipping these religious pamphlets on your windshields."
Ned Flanders,"Start 'er up, boys!"
Ned Flanders,"He's the kindest, sweetest most generous man ever to drive through my living room."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I wish! No, these are complimentary boxes from the shipping company."
Ned Flanders,"Only if he fibbed about his name, age, and occupation on this automated eight-hundred number."
Ned Flanders,Why don't you put this box by your phone so you don't call the number by accident.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you've met my parents."
Ned Flanders,"This is it, boys -- One more out and we go to the championship game. Let's do it for Groundskeeper Willie... who made me this beautiful black bicep warmer!"
Ned Flanders,"Now Bart, stay humble! Your baseball cap won't fit over a swelled head."
Ned Flanders,"A damp sponge will take care of this weak, water-based... it's oil-based! Oil-based!"
Ned Flanders,"Fetch Daddy's thinner, boy."
Ned Flanders,You just fetch it!
Ned Flanders,"Okay, ""Smallville""... super dog licks himself. That definitely goes in the naughty pile!"
Ned Flanders,"Sixty Minutes -- Morley Safer has questionable pants fold -- ""The L Word"" -- used the ""L"" word."
Ned Flanders,And now to peruse the local news!
Ned Flanders,"God's least favorite word, uttered on the public airwaves!"
Ned Flanders,To: Online Christian Soldiers... Subject: Televised Super Swear...
Ned Flanders,Imploring people I never met to pressure a government with better things to do to punish a man who meant no harm for something nobody even saw. That's what I'm doing!
Ned Flanders,First things first!
Ned Flanders,Hey Homer!
Ned Flanders,"Why the crescendo, my dear old friend-o?"
Ned Flanders,Okily-dokily!
Ned Flanders,"Top of the mornin', Tow-mer!"
Ned Flanders,So it is! I'm just here to pay the fine for the Sunday School bus. You towed it with the kids still in it!
Ned Flanders,"You know what they say: ""With great power comes great responsibility."""
Ned Flanders,Perhaps I can be of some assistance.
Ned Flanders,I've got something that will scare the H-E-double sippy straws out of them.
Ned Flanders,Welcome to Heck House! You're about to discover what a life of sin will get you!
Ned Flanders,Just get in there!
Ned Flanders,Welcome to eternal darnation!
Ned Flanders,"No, the lesson here is he's being punished for thinking women are beautiful."
Ned Flanders,"Please, Lord, grant me the power to psychologically torture them into loving you."
Ned Flanders,"Behold, the las-diddily-ast room of Ned Flanders's hell house!"
Ned Flanders,Springfield is rife with the seven deadly sins! Starting with... GLUTTONY!
Ned Flanders,Anger!
Ned Flanders,Pride!
Ned Flanders,Sloth!
Ned Flanders,And the rest!
Ned Flanders,Lust!
Ned Flanders,Greed!
Ned Flanders,And envy!
Ned Flanders,And this is where sinners spend all of eternity!
Ned Flanders,"Well then, my work is done."
Ned Flanders,"That concludes our Halloween show for this year. I just want to say that for watching this network, you're all going to Hell. And that includes FX, Fox Sports and our newest Devil's portal, The Wall Street Journal! Welcome to the club!"
Ned Flanders,"I had to -- I heard a hubbub, Bub."
Ned Flanders,"I can't say for sure, but as a Christian, I assume the worst."
Ned Flanders,What're we gonna do? We can't not vote. Nobody does that!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, can I give you folks a lift?"
Ned Flanders,Banks? Well deposit yourselves in a seat 'cause you've earned my interest!
Ned Flanders,"They're outlaws?! I've been played like a pair of spoons! Well, who am I to judge -- it's the Depression, money's tight..."
Ned Flanders,"Unmarried?! That's it, I'm turning 'em in."
Ned Flanders,"Listen Sheriff, I can help you take down Bonnie and Clyde."
Ned Flanders,Um... the battery seems to be dead. I'll get some help by hidin' in that bush.
Ned Flanders,"C'mon, shoot! Shoot!"
Ned Flanders,Not me!
Ned Flanders,"As the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. I spent the whole morning blackin' out the ""goshes"" and ""darns"" in these Hardy Boys books."
Ned Flanders,Okily dokily!
Ned Flanders,"Ah, ""heck,"" ""darn"" -- I don't think so."
Ned Flanders,Ow! What was that for?
Ned Flanders,Zippin' it up!
Ned Flanders,My aquarium!
Ned Flanders,Oh for crying out loud -- people aren't mice!
Ned Flanders,"Look Homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our Lord, who came back as bread. That's it."
Ned Flanders,Even the sing-alongs?
Ned Flanders,Bullet-proof glass.
Ned Flanders,"Yep, I'm just replacing the front window at my store, which was broken in the riot."
Ned Flanders,"Young man, what would your mother say if she knew you were shooting nice people in the brain?"
Ned Flanders,"Well son, if you take responsibility for your actions, this could be the start of a better life for you."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you could've killed him!"
Ned Flanders,Now I can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. Enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
Ned Flanders,What the?
Ned Flanders,"Us... a team? As the salad said to the soup, ""I'm all mixed up."""
Ned Flanders,"Well... I could use money. But you have to promise me something, Homer."
Ned Flanders,We have to do everything by the book.
Ned Flanders,"My friend, you have a deal-arooney!"
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, thank you for creating so many evil criminals for us to bring in. And also, thank you for my partner Homer, who..."
Ned Flanders,Did you just taser my coffee?
Ned Flanders,"Homer, can we take it easy on the taser?"
Ned Flanders,Our first bail jumper!
Ned Flanders,"Homer, take the taser out of your pants."
Ned Flanders,Bible salesman!
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I don't think we have the same musical tastes."
Ned Flanders,I like their Christian cover band: A.D.-B.C.! KINDLY DEEDS / DONE FOR FREE / KINDLY DEEDS
Ned Flanders,KINDLY DEEDS / DONE FOR FREE
Ned Flanders,KINDLY DEEDS / AND THEY'RE DONE FOR FREE / KINDLY DEEDS / AND THEY'RE DONE FOR FREE
Ned Flanders,Hm. I've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.
Ned Flanders,"Man, that's harder to swallow than evolution."
Ned Flanders,Not bad.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, kitten whiskers!"
Ned Flanders,"Lord, in your mercy, could you give my friend a stroke?"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! You need a special sticker just to bring a bike! Have you no respect for the law?"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, no! You promised... Everything was supposed to be by the book!"
Ned Flanders,This partnership is over!
Ned Flanders,"You know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas."
Ned Flanders,"Lucky Jim, I'm out of the bounty hunting business."
Ned Flanders,"Forget it! I am turning in my... well, I don't really have anything to turn in. So that's that! I suggest you call Homer Simpson."
Ned Flanders,Homer!
Ned Flanders,Not interested.
Ned Flanders,"I'm sure they're all competent professionals, but you'd best leave it to me."
Ned Flanders,"You jumped bail, Homer. I gotta bring you in."
Ned Flanders,I figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at Lisa's recital.
Ned Flanders,Lucky guess.
Ned Flanders,For the last few weeks. But most of the time I've known you you've treated me like dirt!
Ned Flanders,I forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.
Ned Flanders,"I like you too, but you broke the law. So I've got to bring you in."
Ned Flanders,"Thanks, but... what are you holding on to?"
Ned Flanders,"""...lest I come and strike the earth with a curse."" Thus ends the book of Malachi. I guess I did know the whole Old Testament by heart. Out with the old... in with the new. Testament, that is. Matthew One. ""The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham..."""
Ned Flanders,...Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers. Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar.
Ned Flanders,Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram.
Ned Flanders,"Howdy-do, strangers! Hop on in before you become a couple runneth over!"
Ned Flanders,"And in that mud, I'm plantin' the seed of friendship. Name's Ned Flanders!"
Ned Flanders,"As the elephant said to the peanut vendor, toss those in my trunk!"
Ned Flanders,"Put 'er there, muddy buddy."
Ned Flanders,Really? Not married? And you were bicycling two abreast?
Ned Flanders,"Wordplay: never cared for it. But it's never too soon for you two to join the ""I do"" crew. Now I'm not sayin' it's all Jell-O with Cool Whip. She'll nag ya. She'll try to change ya. You'll be fighting the same basic fight for years and years and years--"
Ned Flanders,I think I'd like to finish my sentence: and years.
Ned Flanders,Since two this afternoon. Welcome to our honeymoon!
Ned Flanders,"Well, when the sun goes down it means God's gone to China to watch over those good folks. Time for some shuteye."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry, Homer, I'm afraid it's separate accommodations for you notly-weds."
Ned Flanders,That's just your trouser devil talking!
Ned Flanders,"Goodnight, Marge."
Ned Flanders,"Sweet dreams, my new best friend."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, what better way to celebrate our wedding night than by keeping an unmarried couple apart?"
Ned Flanders,"Aw, Maude. Your dead grandmother's pajamas. You know what that does to me."
Ned Flanders,So... I'm sure you missed Marge last night.
Ned Flanders,"What a charming single entendre. Now look, I know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, here she comes! Why don't you take Marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?"
Ned Flanders,Don't you think I've got better things to do on my honeymoon than spy on you two?
Ned Flanders,"Red Dog, this is Mustache One. We have possible male/female interaction -- be prepared to terminate inappropriate contact."
Ned Flanders,Lock onto his wiener.
Ned Flanders,"As the worm said to the plate of spaghetti, ""I... I..."
Ned Flanders,I noticed.
Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, maybe I could use a break from the ol' Weed 'N' Feed."
Ned Flanders,Three... two... one... it's Ash Wednesday everybody! Set down your gins and confess your sins!
Ned Flanders,One hundred and one thousand!
Ned Flanders,So I can rent it back to you. Just pay what you can till you get back on your feet.
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, as the ocean said to the dirt, I appreciate the sediment."
Ned Flanders,"Say Homer, why don't you let me take a peek at that leak?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, actually... as your landlord, repairs are my responsibility. I'll just get my tools..."
Ned Flanders,"Try 'er now, Marge."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess I'd better be..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, as you are my tenants, I'll see what I can do."
Ned Flanders,"When I was putting new insulation in your attic, I slipped on this lamp and really banged my head."
Ned Flanders,"So, unless you have anything else for me..."
Ned Flanders,Hello?
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm sorry, I just had my glass of warm milk which means I am closed for business!"
Ned Flanders,The rent check is late.
Ned Flanders,Let's see what else is on.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, this is good."
Ned Flanders,"Homer Simpson, I took pity on you, and what do I get in return? A kick in the kadiddlehopper!"
Ned Flanders,It's not funny! That's how I swear!
Ned Flanders,"When the month is up, I want you out!"
Ned Flanders,Wha? Who's that?
Ned Flanders,"Uh, say, ""Jesus,"" what was the name of the son of Zachariah?"
Ned Flanders,Because your father lives with me now.
Ned Flanders,"You two are the kind of tenants every landlord dreams of: excellent credit, Christian but not Baptist, and let's see: according to your application you only have sex for procreation."
Ned Flanders,My ballpoint is all clicked-up for you.
Ned Flanders,"Lord, you said love thy neighbor, but you didn't have to make it so easy."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, that's just a family... who used to... make my life, uh... interesting."
Ned Flanders,Folks...
Ned Flanders,I'm afraid you can't live here.
Ned Flanders,"Well, the people who lived here before, um, weren't always the best neighbors. But I love 'em. And, uh, you can't be a saint unless you live among the lepers. Hope you don't mind."
Ned Flanders,I think you should. The court papers will be a great way to stay in touch.
Ned Flanders,It's okay if you backslide a little.
Ned Flanders,The Simpsons are back!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, cool your jets! We're trying to get to sleep!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, yes."
Ned Flanders,Iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily-iddily...
Ned Flanders,The Parson?! He's coming here?
Ned Flanders,Parson! Parson! Give us a quick official church position on family.
Ned Flanders,You just made my moustache tingle!
Ned Flanders,Settle. Settle down.
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, care for some of my devils food cake?"
Ned Flanders,"No, it's angels food with chocolate on top."
Ned Flanders,One cran-bran for the Flan-man.
Ned Flanders,Diddily...
Ned Flanders,"Well boys, Daddy's back on the beam, thanks to Christian prayer and Doctor Sheldon Lowenstein!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I'd put rocks into your pockets and walk you out to sea before that happened."
Ned Flanders,"Okily-dokily. But I'm warning you, you're gonna see America's number-one dishwashing crew!"
Ned Flanders,Then I give 'em the squeak test and into the dishwasher they go!
Ned Flanders,"oh, they're grounded. I found out Rod watched a commercial for ""Grey's Anatomy,"" and Todd took a full day to tell me."
Ned Flanders,What's the next task on the old i-dinnerary?
Ned Flanders,Saved by the bell from eternity in Hell!
Ned Flanders,"Marge, that dinner was a winner! What's for dessert?"
Ned Flanders,I never thought otherwise.
Ned Flanders,"Well, see ya 'round the mailbox, Marge."
Ned Flanders,My wife? And my worst friend? Could it be?
Ned Flanders,Naw.
Ned Flanders,Just as I feared: her Buddhism has led directly to witchcraft.
Ned Flanders,And she's teleconferencing the Devil using that computer from Hell!
Ned Flanders,We'll let the authorities sort that out.
Ned Flanders,"Top of the mornin', Homer."
Ned Flanders,Seen the paper?
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, it looks like your Dad is a quotable notable."
Ned Flanders,"You know Marge, Maude and I had a fight right before she died..."
Ned Flanders,"You know, maybe I should use a towel marked ""B.D.D."" -- big diddily deal!"
Ned Flanders,I play that fight over in my mind a thousand times a day.
Ned Flanders,What about Sodom and Gomorrah?
Ned Flanders,Thank you all for coming.
Ned Flanders,"Now let's start with the words everyone loves to hear: ""Welcome to Bible study!"""
Ned Flanders,"Today, my readin' ribbon's smack dab in the middle of Matthew twenty-three."
Ned Flanders,"Now let us ""download"" the holy ""tweet"" of the Lord."
Ned Flanders,Duly noted. But we will make sure not to dilute the sacred gospel.
Ned Flanders,"Mouse pad! Double click! Skyyype! Uh, Skyyype! Matthew twenty-three: ""Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"""
Ned Flanders,I'll handle this.
Ned Flanders,"Homer Simpson! You are the most infuriating, Netflix-D.V.D.-burgling, barbecue-not-putting-out..."
Ned Flanders,...man I ever met!
Ned Flanders,That man is beyond redemption!
Ned Flanders,"I sense a ""but"" coming, Reverend..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh Reverend, I've been workin' my bible to the bone tryin' to save that man."
Ned Flanders,Homer? Homer?
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, our bible study group is going to the Holy Land next month. I'd like you and your family to come as my guests."
Ned Flanders,"Yep. I also want to try something called ""pita bread."""
Ned Flanders,The Old City. Where B.C. turned into A.D.! Let's go!
Ned Flanders,"Homer, that's not why we're here. We can see the stations of the cross!"
Ned Flanders,"Okay, let's just put it to a vote."
Ned Flanders,"I can't believe we lost, Reverend."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, please help Homer experience the redemptive power of this sacred land."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, could you at least turn the camera off?"
Ned Flanders,Homer...
Ned Flanders,Bleh.
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, Homer, you might really benefit from opening your heart to the spirituality of this place. Please, neighbor?"
Ned Flanders,"Yes, but it means more to you."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, I think I may have finally reached him..."
Ned Flanders,Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!
Ned Flanders,"Homer, quit playing that back."
Ned Flanders,"And Lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin. And thank you, again, for the challenge of Homer Simpson... we've all got our crosses to bear. Me Homer, you the cross. And now, let me gaze with reverence upon the holy resting place of..."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, this is the most sacred spot in Christendom, not your backyard hammock."
Ned Flanders,Unknown? This is the tomb of the most famous man who ever lived!
Ned Flanders,"Porky Pig's not a man, he's a pig! And he's not even a real pig!"
Ned Flanders,That's it. I'm losin' it. I'm losin' it!
Ned Flanders,You come all the way to Jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
Ned Flanders,Delete! Delete! Delete!
Ned Flanders,"Please, you've gotta let me back in. I sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
Ned Flanders,Banned for life?
Ned Flanders,"Homer, do you know why I'm a Christian?"
Ned Flanders,"It's because I believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. At least I thought so till now. Homer Simpson, you are not worth saving."
Ned Flanders,Not. Worth. Saving.
Ned Flanders,Nothing like a tall glass of luke-warm water to Jekyll down this Hyde.
Ned Flanders,"Ooo, looks like a sandstorm's brewin'. I'll just wait it out at a movie."
Ned Flanders,I did it! I reached him!
Ned Flanders,"Homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, I think you came closest to the truth."
Ned Flanders,I'd like that.
Ned Flanders,You'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
Ned Flanders,Okily dokily.
Ned Flanders,Hot cocoa?
Ned Flanders,"Homer, this meeting of your ""fan club"" is adjourned!"
Ned Flanders,Uh-oh.
Ned Flanders,I've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of Noah's Ark!
Ned Flanders,Maybe. But I feel a little like I'm the Tom Voyeur to these Huckleberry Sinners.
Ned Flanders,I've gone from lookie-loo to talkie-too.
Ned Flanders,"Excuse me, that's your salad fork!... That Wi-Fi's for hotel guests only!... What's the matter, sir, too cool to sing ""Happy Birthday?"""
Ned Flanders,"Isn't this great, Marge? We're like Jiminy Cricket for the whole ding-dang town. A half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. Um-hm."
Ned Flanders,Ahem!
Ned Flanders,"I spy, with my electronic eye, illegal wagering!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, how many times have you been blown up since the cameras went in?"
Ned Flanders,"Mm-hmm! Now I'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. Tsk, tsk, tsk."
Ned Flanders,Don't use that dog as a ramp...
Ned Flanders,Less radical... less radical!
Ned Flanders,Stop gleaming that cube!
Ned Flanders,Buttocks!
Ned Flanders,Tushie!
Ned Flanders,Boy cheeks!... Fanny!... Derriere!... Hiney!... Backside!... ...Cover up that coin slot!
Ned Flanders,"Inspiration Point looks pretty uninspired... All's quiet in Murder Town... Yep, Springfield is cleaner than the Lord's hand towels."
Ned Flanders,"Sour ball, take me away!"
Ned Flanders,Nothin'. Nothin'. Somethin'!
Ned Flanders,Blind spot?! Mecca?!
Ned Flanders,"Rod? Hold up daddy's shaving mirror out the window, would ya?"
Ned Flanders,"I see you now. Rod, you and Todd stay in the house."
Ned Flanders,De-meat those feet!
Ned Flanders,I'm standin' right here!
Ned Flanders,But neighbor... why did you have to do this? I've tattled this town into a paradise!
Ned Flanders,I guess I did create this... like God created the devil.
Ned Flanders,"I never wanted to turn into Big Brother. I just wanted to be Little Sister, tattlin' on everyone so the town would be a nicer place."
Ned Flanders,That's the worst sin of all for some reason! What can I do to make things right?
Ned Flanders,"Neighbor, we've got some work to do."
Ned Flanders,Knock-a-doodle-you!
Ned Flanders,"Neighbor, Marge invited me over to be the little angel on your shoulder, so you wouldn't listen to the four hundred devils on the other."
Ned Flanders,"Howdy, cousin Ted!"
Ned Flanders,Flantastic times two! How are Connie and Bonnie?
Ned Flanders,"Glad to hear it, thank the Holy Spirit!"
Ned Flanders,"Actually, God made some fish that were pretty close to these, so naturally we selected those for further breeding."
Ned Flanders,"Yup, that's exactly... Oh, you almost got me."
Ned Flanders,Not on my watch!
Ned Flanders,"Hey there, neighbor. You look as puffed up as a peacock in a..."
Ned Flanders,"Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you! It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
Ned Flanders,"Bart, call me Walter Matthau, 'cause I'm a bad-news bearer. I'm resigning as manager of your Little League team."
Ned Flanders,"In the last game, our shortstop hit a long foul ball, but the umpire called it a homerun... and I let it go without saying a word. I just don't like the monster I've become."
Ned Flanders,"Excuse me! With all this racket, my boys can't get their sixteen hours sleep."
Ned Flanders,"Hey there, Mr. Burns! For our half hour I thought we'd have a picnic in the park."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, don't be scared, boys. That's just the angels bowling."
Ned Flanders,Homer! Gimme back my tree!
Ned Flanders,"Hey-diddily-hi, Homer."
Ned Flanders,That feeling is Mutual of Omaha.
Ned Flanders,"Well, maybe your kids didn't."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I got excited for nothing."
Ned Flanders,"I didn't do diddily, and certainly not squat!"
Ned Flanders,"Actually, it's kind of cute. You look like Posh Spice."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, isn't that a cute little choo-choo..."
Ned Flanders,"It wasn't me, boys! It was the train!"
Ned Flanders,It was right there... with the ... and the...
Ned Flanders,Did a volcano erupt in Candyland? 'Cause I just caught me a flyin' red hot!
Ned Flanders,"You know, I don't believe we've ever been formally introduced. Anyhoo, so I don't commit the deadliest of sins... omission... here's my card."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, Ms. Krabappel, what made you topple?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm a truthful kinda guy."
Ned Flanders,"So, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the ""Flanders arms."""
Ned Flanders,"Bart Simpson? Why, he lives right next door to me! Yeah, when they made him, they did not skimp on the puppy dog tails."
Ned Flanders,"Homer? Yeah, he's the peanut in your popcorn... lots of fun... I guess. So, what say we have lunch?"
Ned Flanders,"...Y'know, I wouldn't mind Homer lying naked in his hammock, but does he have to string it up higher than the fence line?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I'm afraid my Maudie's putting plastic on the clouds now."
Ned Flanders,"Besides my kids, the only thing in my life is my business... The Leftorium. We've been the anchor store in the ""sad mall"" for the last ten years."
Ned Flanders,"And you're a former Mrs. So, uh... where's your husband buried?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh boy, that laugh is infectious. Ha!... Ha!... that's fun!"
Ned Flanders,"Well thank you for taking me to that Pinkberry place. It's a lot less racy than its name would lead you to believe. Crossin' it off my ""do-not-go"" list."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, I guess I better refenestrate ya."
Ned Flanders,Any chance I could see you again?
Ned Flanders,"Whoa, slow down. I never go to ""second entendre"" on the first date."
Ned Flanders,"Edna, you're a very beautiful woman... but I'm a little uh, you know... uncomfortable with premarital sex."
Ned Flanders,Oh yes they were! We deliberately chose a Doctor Stork so we could say it without lying.
Ned Flanders,"But I think if we hold off for a while, you'll find I'm well worth the wait. Like a mild cheddar I get tangy when I'm sittin' on the shelf."
Ned Flanders,"Well, a little nibble won't hurt your appetite."
Ned Flanders,You have the energy for one more?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, what the heck. I know it's impolite to make a move till episode twenty-five of a Ken Burns documentary, but you're that special."
Ned Flanders,"That's right, I'm down to my wife-blesser."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, could you stop throwin' balls over my fence?"
Ned Flanders,"Pretty funny, Homer."
Ned Flanders,Actually... she sort of does.
Ned Flanders,Language.
Ned Flanders,And I'll just take my tumbleweed back...
Ned Flanders,"I don't wanna come here. Last time I did, someone slipped me a Mickey and wrote ""CHURCHY JOE"" on my face."
Ned Flanders,Oh my.
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, let me guess. You're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' Edna."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, listen to me. For a long time now I've been lookin' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with Marge. Then I remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine."
Ned Flanders,Someone to hold the other end of the sheet when I fold it up. Someone to put in my prayers.
Ned Flanders,"That's right. And like any man, I put on my secret Christian underpants one leg at a time."
Ned Flanders,You all know Edna?
Ned Flanders,Joey Kramer? The drummer from Aerosmith?
Ned Flanders,Wait... you've all plucked a peach from her tree?
Ned Flanders,"Well Homer, you really put one over on old stupid Flanders, here. Thanks a lot, neighbor."
Ned Flanders,No. Just plain neighbor.
Ned Flanders,Oh I was just wondering how many boxes of staples I should order for the store. Does ten sound like a lot to you? Twenty? Fifty? What does sound like a lot to you?
Ned Flanders,Maybe we should just call it a night.
Ned Flanders,"I can't do it! Edna, call me Delta Airlines 'cause I can't handle your extra baggage."
Ned Flanders,"Edna, I had a long walk with Homer Simpson yesterday, and as I was carrying him back home, I had a lot of time to think."
Ned Flanders,"You've been with a lot of men, but I forgive you!"
Ned Flanders,I guess this is gonna have to be decided by a higher power.
Ned Flanders,"Hey Simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life?"
Ned Flanders,I started drinking orange juice with pulp! I asked the Reverend and he said it was okay. Then he hung right up on me. That man is cranky at three in the mornin'.
Ned Flanders,We just wanted to give you all a big thank you from Team Nedna.
Ned Flanders,"Springfield. My home town. Pretty little place. Although, even the Garden of Eden could use a nice cleansing rain now and then."
Ned Flanders,Spend less time on your back and more time on your knees.
Ned Flanders,No more distractions. I have work to do.
Ned Flanders,"All these years I thought murder was a sin. Then, I got new instructions from the good Lord Himself, through my bible: in his favorite language -- English."
Ned Flanders,"Are you sure, Lord?"
Ned Flanders,And so white-bread Ned became the avenging sword of the Lord.
Ned Flanders,"Peter, Andrew, James the Greater, James the Lesser, John, Philip, Thaddeus!"
Ned Flanders,"Heavenly Father, I..."
Ned Flanders,"Patty and Selma?! Sure they smoke, and they don't shave much of anything, but... do they deserve to die?"
Ned Flanders,"Yes, Lord."
Ned Flanders,Really?
Ned Flanders,Homer Simpson!
Ned Flanders,You made a killer out of me!
Ned Flanders,I'm gonna kill you!
Ned Flanders,Because of you I'm going to Hell!
Ned Flanders,Hell! Damn! Backside! Nothing matters anymore! I'm goin' down and my hand-basket seats two!
Ned Flanders,"Wake up, Flanders! There is no Hell, and there is no God. If there were, would He let me do this?"
Ned Flanders,"But, but..."
Ned Flanders,Could this get any worse?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, for cryin' out loud!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, looks like it's time for another ""'End of the Walk' Talk With Homer and Ned."" Tonight's topic: ""The Niceness of the Evening."""
Ned Flanders,"Homer, all nonsense aside, are you okalidokalaroony?"
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, I knew a backstabbin' buckeye named Roz at Bible Camp. Twice as tall as she should've been."
Ned Flanders,"It is! But if you've got the stones, I can tell you how to slay that Gal-ioth."
Ned Flanders,What the? I've been using that around the boys!
Ned Flanders,"Thank you. Now, it was one of our biggest celebrations...the nineteenth Sunday after Easter. We'd just had a rousing no-fun run and in the heat of the moment I wanted to offer my respectful best wishes."
Ned Flanders,Peace be with you.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, she went crazy. Crazier than sleeping in on a Sunday."
Ned Flanders,And I haven't. Not until now.
Ned Flanders,"Oh that's nice, but I don't approve of--"
Ned Flanders,"Welcome to the ""Cross"" Games, Simpsons! A Christian fellowship expo!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh no, ""Games"" stands for Gathering of American Messengers for Evangelical Sports!"
Ned Flanders,Sports stands for Strict Parental Oversight Rather Than Sports!
Ned Flanders,Coggily-doggily.
Ned Flanders,"Sure is! That's why after Homer accidentally killed Edna, I married Maude's ghost!"
Ned Flanders,Isn't she pretty?
Ned Flanders,"I thought I smelled death-a-diddly. What is that, an eight-pointer?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, the only thing left-wing about me is the way I write."
Ned Flanders,That's just fine as long as you're not a Mormon!
Ned Flanders,Bedbugs? Just why is there a bed in City Hall?
Ned Flanders,Make way for Captain Coolerhead!
Ned Flanders,"Now, I like a good old-fashioned witch trial as much as the next person, but I do not think we should be so quick to judge our long-time neighbors..."
Ned Flanders,I withdraw my... diddily...
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly-ho, Dream Team!"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, when am I gettin' my power drill back?"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, Homer, I'm afraid this is the part of God's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots."
Ned Flanders,"Name's Ned Flanders, credits include Jesus in the passion play last year, Jesus in the passion play the year before that, Jesus, Jesus, a kindly hobo who turns out to be -- you guessed it, St. Peter..."
Ned Flanders,But-but-but...
Ned Flanders,"Well, congratulations, Homer. Guess this is just my cross to bear."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, I know you see all, but trust me, you do not want to see this."
Ned Flanders,"You know, Homer's givin' it the old bible college try. Maybe I should have dialed down the Doubting Thomas."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, forgive me for my pride. All-wise, as always, you have rightly raised Homer above me."
Ned Flanders,Never again will I question...
Ned Flanders,/
Ned Flanders,Diddily... doodily...
Ned Flanders,"No atheist blood, please."
Ned Flanders,S'okay... she's my wife.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, now we'll have an open marriage!"
Ned Flanders,"No, but I'm sure Newt Gingrich wouldn't steer us wrong."
Ned Flanders,'Cause everyone in this town makes such a big heckabaloo out of everything.
Ned Flanders,"Oh Lord, please bless our blended family..."
Ned Flanders,"Boys, you will please call your new mother whatever she feels comfortable with."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?"
Ned Flanders,Less news from the pews!
Ned Flanders,"Okay Simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause I think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun."
Ned Flanders,"I'm sorry honey, but I'm stuck in this meeting of the Springfield L.G.B.T. The Left-Gifted, Bidextrous, and Transhanded community. We're tryin' to decide on the theme for our ""Left is Right"" parade."
Ned Flanders,This could go late -- we haven't even ordered pizzas and pop yet. Can you handle Rod and Todd's parent-teacher conference for me?
Ned Flanders,You pulled the boys out of school?!
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir... when we got married, I knew I'd find some spices in my chili. I guess they can go to Springfield Hellementary."
Ned Flanders,"Well, that's just great, boys. Now, come over here so Mrs. Simpson can take a photo."
Ned Flanders,What if we were raptured right now?
Ned Flanders,"Chillax?! Young man, in the Flanders house, we speak the King's Diddily."
Ned Flanders,"You get my boys tattoos, you change their school, you buy Rod sneakers that light up like Times Square...shoes are shoes and lights are lights! Now, just when do I get a say in how my boys are raised?! This marriage isn't perfect!"
Ned Flanders,"Fine, I guess. Thanks for loaning me your pajamas, Homer. And Marge, thank you for those helpful chip bag clips."
Ned Flanders,"I just felt so ashamed I just couldn't go home. Today, I gave in to the one thing I vowed I would never have in my marriage: strong feeling."
Ned Flanders,"So after all this time together, you two still haven't agreed on how to raise your kids?"
Ned Flanders,Pause the assembly! I have to talk to my wife!
Ned Flanders,"Edna, I'm sorry and I'll say it in front of God or Groundskeeper Willie!"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, the Simpsons make it up as they go along, and they're as happy as a ribbon in a bible. What do you say, sweetie?"
Ned Flanders,MY MOUSTACHE / IS BRISTLY / MY LETTERS / ARE EPISTLY / AND I DON'T WANNA / MISLEAD YOU / I LIKE TO HUG AND KISSLY--
Ned Flanders,"FIRST BASE, YO! / I LIKE CHRISTIAN RAP / A BIBLE ON MY LAP..."
Ned Flanders,Okily-dokily!
Ned Flanders,"Well, hello! It's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night."
Ned Flanders,"Name's Ned Flanders, I've heard of you. Haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm."
Ned Flanders,"Yes, but Jesus said that... pretty much the same thing. Darnit, the Bible said the Devil would be attractive!"
Ned Flanders,"Unless you're gonna slap some wieners on those, turn 'em off!"
Ned Flanders,"Joke's on you, I needed a trim!"
Ned Flanders,"Lord, you're testin' me, aren't ya?"
Ned Flanders,Homer! Is that my camera?
Ned Flanders,"Gambling, eh? Satan's most potent recruiting tool!"
Ned Flanders,"Diddily, Diddily, diddily, diddily!"
Ned Flanders,Asterisk-pound sign-at sign-exclamation point!
Ned Flanders,"Edna, I'm not one for costumes, but I sure do like that feather in your hair."
Ned Flanders,Homer! Homer! It's a miracle!
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I will! Till I go to bed and take 'em off under the covers! But come outside and see the miracle!"
Ned Flanders,"No, it's still where you buried it."
Ned Flanders,Here it is. The Holy Ooze.
Ned Flanders,Look a little closer.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, if you ask me, somebody up there is trying to tell you that whatever flat tires you've got in your life, God's there, with His little spare, that enables you to drive real slow till you get to the next station."
Ned Flanders,Don't eat the miracle!
Ned Flanders,"To be honest, that comes as a tremendous relief."
Ned Flanders,"I just thought if we got together we could change the channel from ""The Feud Network"" to ""Comity Central."""
Ned Flanders,"Yes, but there's two sides to every--"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, neighbor, your welcome mat's lookin' a little dusty."
Ned Flanders,Mind if I come over and sweeten your greetin'. Sweeten your greetin'! SWEETEN YOUR GREETIN'!
Ned Flanders,"I hate to be a nag, but this is my real head."
Ned Flanders,And the spirit of neighborly cooperation broke out as if all the weird angry people had left.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, the Lord wouldn't have placed His meter there if He didn't want me to park."
Ned Flanders,Sure!
Ned Flanders,Goes with the sugar!
Ned Flanders,Why don't you come on in and have breakfast with us?
Ned Flanders,"Eh, for a little bit."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you know my parents, Capri and Nedward."
Ned Flanders,"Dad, don't encourage him."
Ned Flanders,"Now, you know we don't discuss politics at the table!"
Ned Flanders,There's no emergency here! And please charge us for the false report! I'm going out for a power walk.
Ned Flanders,Six miles and I'm all smiles!
Ned Flanders,Funyuns?! Little Debbies?!
Ned Flanders,That's cross-legged music!
Ned Flanders,Homer! I can't believe you're partaking with my parents!
Ned Flanders,"Marge, I've been racked with guilt and pain... my moustache fell out! This is a clip-on!"
Ned Flanders,"Sorry, Homer. Now, do you mind if I pray at your bedside?"
Ned Flanders,Not praying to a character in a comic book.
Ned Flanders,Neither canonical nor comical.
Ned Flanders,Not praying to Superman!
Ned Flanders,That's the plug for the light!
Ned Flanders,Please don't use that word in bed.
Ned Flanders,Dare I take another sleep aid?
Ned Flanders,Better not take a full dose.
Ned Flanders,See you in eight hours!
Ned Flanders,Was this always waitin' for me or was it recently thrown together? That's what I wanna know.
Ned Flanders,No -- not surf and Murph!
Ned Flanders,The answer to my woe must be in here.
Ned Flanders,Nope... not that... not to my taste... flag that for later... finally!
Ned Flanders,I know what I must do.
Ned Flanders,Homer. Homer! I found the answer!
Ned Flanders,"""Life shall go for life, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth..."""
Ned Flanders,I would embrace such a glad visit!
Ned Flanders,"I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew."
Ned Flanders,"Jeepers creepers, pop my peeper!"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, just call me a little bubble 'cause I'm on the level. Punch me."
Ned Flanders,"C'mon, Homer. I'm insisting on a fisting."
Ned Flanders,What? Why?!
Ned Flanders,No! You can't! If I'm not as good as you... then I'm horrible!
Ned Flanders,"Now, there's no need to..."
Ned Flanders,Enough!
Ned Flanders,Now you're rhyming?!
Ned Flanders,"Come on, people! You're safe as Sunday with me. I wouldn't hurt a fly!"
Ned Flanders,Never get into Heaven... took harp lessons for nothing...
Ned Flanders,"My prayers have been answered! Well actually, just this one."
Ned Flanders,"You wanna hit me. Well sir, here's a roll of quarters to put in your fist for extra punching power!"
Ned Flanders,Now you can shatter my orbital bone! That'll knock the wax off my candle!
Ned Flanders,Edna!
Ned Flanders,"You know how you said you could help me with any desire and nothing was forbidden? Well, sir, I want you to rid of Lisa's bully teacher."
Ned Flanders,I'm glad the only beef between us is this burger!
Ned Flanders,"How long has it been since we prayed together, neighbor?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer, can I get back my..."
Ned Flanders,Noooo!
Ned Flanders,"Well, the good news is it forced us all to church."
Ned Flanders,Church!
Ned Flanders,It's the parson!
Ned Flanders,Church songs with clapping... I don't think this is what Martin Presbyluther had in mind when he founded our religion by sticking his Three Suggestions under the Pope's windshield wiper.
Ned Flanders,"I don't understand that on any level, but yes."
Ned Flanders,He's in a place full of brimstone and exposed flesh.
Ned Flanders,Yes.
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, we want you to come back."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, this is just the kind of tomfoolery that's been on the upswing since you left! Pure, unadulterated tomfoolery!"
Ned Flanders,We've lost him.
Ned Flanders,None taken.
Ned Flanders,God doesn't need Twitter to reach people. He uses leprosy and plagues.
Ned Flanders,Neither! And I don't like it when other people rhyme!
Ned Flanders,I'd like to turn in this boy for thinkin' about doin' something naughty... and myself for waiting thirty seconds before bringing him here.
Ned Flanders,Can you teach my boys? But no tickling the ivories. You treat them with respect.
Ned Flanders,All right! A chance to make a new friend!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Simpsons! Don't mean to be a pesto, but I'll be happy to watch your scampy shrimp."
Ned Flanders,Tithe denied! Tithe denied!
Ned Flanders,"Pray for a miracle, boy! God can hear you better from up there!"
Ned Flanders,That's not a prayer!
Ned Flanders,"Can I help you, stranger?"
Ned Flanders,That sounds salty but you seem sweet. I'm gonna call you kettle corn!
Ned Flanders,I haven't felt this inspired since the blueberries at breakfast!
Ned Flanders,A brief one.
Ned Flanders,"I said a fit, not a fervor!"
Ned Flanders,"Well... I'm down to a kiosk, thanks to that place."
Ned Flanders,"Actually, half a kiosk. Sharing it with Nasreen here."
Ned Flanders,Children... perhaps it's time that I explain the true meaning of Christmas.
Ned Flanders,Okily-dokily.
Ned Flanders,"We may be going to hell for seeing ""side bosom,"" but this backyard is a little slice of Heaven, all thanks to Homer Simpson!"
Ned Flanders,Does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church?
Ned Flanders,Teen abstinence counseling! You get to pass out abstinence pledges and make sure the kids sign their John Han-bleeps.
Ned Flanders,Not this month! Edna signed us up for a tango class. It was the only way I could avert wine tasting.
Ned Flanders,Their skipping lessons are really payin' off!
Ned Flanders,"I told you, the only dancing I like is ""square."""
Ned Flanders,Okay.
Ned Flanders,Sure do miss that laugh.
Ned Flanders,"Well, look who's back."
Ned Flanders,That was my spatula!
Ned Flanders,"Ah, too much aggravation! We just forego flipped food!"
Ned Flanders,You'll only taste the spoon!
Ned Flanders,Should we do something?
Ned Flanders,"I learned that left is called ""port""!"
Ned Flanders,The therapy bears! Look out for the therapy bears!
Ned Flanders,You're never bored paintin' the Lord.
Ned Flanders,Say no more.
Ned Flanders,"Well, we pulled more plugs than a Dutch doctor. Now let's take a trip to the side of the house."
Ned Flanders,Why that's a higher power than even I believe in. What is going on?
Ned Flanders,"Really, really, really?"
Ned Flanders,Homer! This is my freezerino.
Ned Flanders,It's the name of the freezer!
Ned Flanders,"Right next to Mount Fu-Gee, I'm glad to see ya!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I felt a little guilty for taking back what belonged to me."
Ned Flanders,Never claimed to be.
Ned Flanders,Christmas is my busy season. Sold three pairs of scissors this month! Two came back.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, our good Lord, and my boys are all I've really got. All Edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which I'm still working my way through."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, just snowflakes on my mustache."
Ned Flanders,Sure... but your eyelashes are long and luxurious already. Are you just buying this to be nice?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Homer! Unto us this day, a neighbor is born! But why?"
Ned Flanders,"Well that curled my lashes, but good for you."
Ned Flanders,This is a whole new relationship for us! We'll be friends! In this life and the next!
Ned Flanders,My best friend is a great runner!
Ned Flanders,Am I hearing this right? Is the church council truly considering... gambling?
Ned Flanders,"Why, I bet the Lord is pleased as punch that we're using that dirty casino money to rebuild his temple. Our mission is one hundred percent pure."
Ned Flanders,She's right. We thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed. But we were scathed! Those free ginger ales at the casino... I didn't declare them on my taxes!
Ned Flanders,"See Marge, someone up in the sky did hear your prayers..."
Ned Flanders,"Just hold your horses, son. Hey, hey, Simpson."
Ned Flanders,Do you think this looks okay?
Ned Flanders,"Ow. Oh, Simpson, it's you."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, my, what a little mess we've got here! Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine?"
Ned Flanders,This one's mine. And this one's mine. This one's mine... and this--
Ned Flanders,"Well, happy holidays, Simpson."
Ned Flanders,You bet.
Ned Flanders,"How do you like my new wheels, Simpson?"
Ned Flanders,Yes indeedilly-doodily.
Ned Flanders,"Simple, Simpson. Credit."
Ned Flanders,"Oooh, She's a beaut. Hey, congratulations, Simpson. I'm sure you'll have loads of fun."
Ned Flanders,"Doing a little yard work, huh?"
Ned Flanders,"Say Simpson, I-I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif."
Ned Flanders,"Well, ooh, there... there... and uh there's a big patch over there."
Ned Flanders,"Well, you may be right!"
Ned Flanders,"Couldn't help overhearing, Simpson. I've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me."
Ned Flanders,"Say, that's right. This is your first visit to the Flanders homestead."
Ned Flanders,"There's my little Popcorn Ball. Kissy, kissy."
Ned Flanders,"Ain't she wonderful, Simpson?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, your beer. Uh, is draft okay? Just put in the tap last week."
Ned Flanders,"Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland."
Ned Flanders,"My pleasure, Study Buddy."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you know how that embarrasses me."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, kids can be a trial sometimes."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, knock what off, Simpson?"
Ned Flanders,"Simpson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand."
Ned Flanders,I feel terrible.
Ned Flanders,Sometimes I forget that we have things a little better than the Simpsons. I drag him over here. He has a few beers. You can't blame him for erupting.
Ned Flanders,And then I turn into a snarling beast. Talk about flunking the old turn-the-other-cheek test!
Ned Flanders,"Hello, Reverend Lovejoy."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, there's Homer Simpson! Oh, what a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, I'm sorry to bother you at this hour but I threw a man out of my house today. I feel like I've violated Matthew 19:19."
Ned Flanders,Love thy neighbor.
Ned Flanders,"A gentle answer. Well, that is a jim-dandy idea. Bless you, Reverend."
Ned Flanders,Dear Neighbor...
Ned Flanders,"I don't blame you for being upset with me, Homer. I just wanted to give you this letter. I'll leave now."
Ned Flanders,"Hi, Simpson! Having fun?"
Ned Flanders,"Ah, just playing a little mini-golf with the Todd-meister."
Ned Flanders,"Say, now that we're all friends again, why don't we make a foursome?"
Ned Flanders,"All right! This will be fun! Oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there."
Ned Flanders,"Good shot, Toddsky!"
Ned Flanders,"So, my little Bartley, thinking of entering the tournament?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Simpson."
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, may the best man win."
Ned Flanders,"Now, just a minute, Simpson. I think my son has a very good chance."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, well, I'm not a betting man."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I'm a chicken, am I?"
Ned Flanders,"All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!"
Ned Flanders,"No, I just --"
Ned Flanders,"You know, Simpson, you're starting to annoy me."
Ned Flanders,"All right, and if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a change!"
Ned Flanders,"You have yourself a bet, you jackaninny!"
Ned Flanders,"Eh, eh, just a minute. ""Loser"" is such a harsh word. Couldn't we just say ""the boy who doesn't win""?"
Ned Flanders,There you go.
Ned Flanders,"Good gravy, what have I done?"
Ned Flanders,"Actually, Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt."
Ned Flanders,"No, you will."
Ned Flanders,'Fraid so.
Ned Flanders,'Fraid so.
Ned Flanders,'Fraid so infinity plus one.
Ned Flanders,"Mercy is for the weak, Todd."
Ned Flanders,"It's okay, son. You can recover."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. Put 'er there, pal."
Ned Flanders,What are you talking about? Neither boy lost.
Ned Flanders,"But... neither, I mean we're both... I mean, you have to do it too."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days."
Ned Flanders,"Oh my, Lisa was wonderful. She certainly's come a long way with her fingering."
Ned Flanders,"Shhh. It's coming up, son, it's coming up."
Ned Flanders,My son... my son.
Ned Flanders,"Simpson, what a pleasant surprise. We were just pulling taffy."
Ned Flanders,No-sirree-Bob!
Ned Flanders,"Okey-dokel. Hey, why don't you and your family come over for a barbecue tomorrow?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, are you sure? We got that new propane beauty just sittin' in the back yard."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, it's crying out to cook up some good eatin'."
Ned Flanders,"Mmm Mm, sounds terriff!"
Ned Flanders,That is the most dishonest thing I've ever heard.
Ned Flanders,"I should box your ears you, you, you... You Sneaky Pete!"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, you easy. Now, get off my property! Off!"
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh. I wanted to subscribe to that new Arts and Crafts Channel. Well, sir, they send over this flimflam man to install it, and do you know what he did? He offered to hook me up illegally to every cable channel for only fifty bucks."
Ned Flanders,"You know, that's exactly what I --"
Ned Flanders,"Well, howdaly-do, Simpson? Gettin' a little exercise, eh? Good for you, pal. Oh, look at this old rascal! He's a wet old baby boy, isn't he? Isn't he? You're just a water monster."
Ned Flanders,"Mr. Universe, I wish!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you betcha! You know, they got velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue, built-in pedometer, reflective sidewalls and little vanity license plates."
Ned Flanders,"Well, you know they're not givin' 'em away. But sometimes you've just got to spoil yourself."
Ned Flanders,"Whoops, my heart rate's dropping. Better skedaddley-do."
Marge,You leave me sitting here all alone...
Marge,...while you play video games with your Neanderthal friends.
Marge,Why don't you just stop playing?
Marge,"Homer, I really don't want to feed you."
Marge,Video games and too much beer. You sure know how to show a girl a good time.
Marge,Tonight I learned the two of us can't work.
Marge,I'm afraid it's Top Ramen again.
Marge,"I'm sorry, I'm not ready to do that yet. I want to wait until I'm married, or at least really drunk."
Marge,I did tell you.
Marge,I can't believe I got in. It's like a dream come true. An expensive dream.
Marge,This place is just like the brochure... autumn leaves...bull sessions...
Marge,"Homie, my mind has been opened in so many ways! Did you know that every U.S. president has been a straight white man?"
Marge,And did you also know that history is written by the winners?
Marge,"If you think that, you should meet my new professor. Professor August has shown me a side of the world I never knew."
Marge,Uhhh... not exactly.
Marge,"Professor, do you think white male scientists have marginalized the contributions of the third world?"
Marge,Professor August says the situation comedy is a doomed genre.
Marge,I wish you would support my comments.
Marge,Are the lasers supposed to burn you?
Marge,Homer! You're embarrassing me!
Marge,"Homie, go home. We'll talk about this later."
Marge,"Homer, your music is so angry and bitter."
Marge,Well here's a question for you: why should I stay with a man who resents how I've flowered?
Marge,Who gets... Cutie-puss?
Marge,I sure am! I want your knowledge inside me!
Marge,Have you really read all these books?
Marge,Why don't we put on some music?
Marge,"Yeah, sure."
Marge,"Oh, evolve yourself, Professor Jerk -- or should I say, Associate Professor Jerk!"
Marge,Could he be singing about me?
Marge,He is!
Marge,He loves me so much... after what I did to him!
Marge,"Oh no, narcotics!"
Marge,"Oh my God, you're a junkie!"
Marge,I'm getting you off this stuff.
Marge,"Homie, I got so caught up in the world of college that I forgot how important your love was. Can you find it in your heart to take me back?"
Marge,"You're right. But I'm worried about what's on the horizon: reality shows, Britney Spears, the suspicious number of home runs being hit."
Marge,Okay.
Marge,You know what I want to be when I grow up?
Marge,"No, I'm going to be an astronaut."
Marge,Why not?
Marge,There will too be women astronauts!
Marge,It's true! And we'll all live in cities on the moon.
Marge,"I don't want a life of watching you get drunk, then holding back your long, beautiful hair while you vomit. I have my own dreams and I can't live them with you."
Marge,"Homie, I was so worried about you. I was really mad at you tonight, but you're a good person and that's what I see most of the time. Whatever problems we have, we have a lifetime to work them out. Together."
Marge,Fraternity pledges in their beanies...
Marge,I think I'm gonna like it here.
Marge,Are you saying that America was founded on... misconceptions?
Marge,"Three to five, right?"
Marge,I will!
Marge,"Thank you, Professor August."
Marge,"Oh, thanks. It's just a note from my boyfriend."
Marge,But Homer's so supportive. He's paying for me to go to college.
Marge,"Well, I know you'd never say anything that isn't objective..."
Marge,When is it due?
Marge,Steffan!
Marge,"Consent, of course."
Marge,Just do it already!
Marge,I thought they were just tall so boats could see them.
Marge,"Look, a wedding!"
Marge,You oppose marriage?
Marge,"But Steffan, I would like to get married some day."
Marge,It's statements like that that... are mean!
Marge,No you don't!
Marge,There'll never be a worse president. Never.
Marge,My husband... and my best friend!
Marge,There's no time! I need you for the wedding toast!
Marge,My hair!
Marge,This is serious. Pay attention!
Marge,...make him feel good about himself.
Marge,Homer! Dr. Hibbert told you to eat healthier!
Marge,Well I do.
Marge,"Oh, I'd love to, but I've got my calculus final tomorrow."
Marge,"Excuse me, is this room one-oh-six?"
Marge,Let go of him! What kind of jerk strangles a little boy?
Marge,I know who I'm in love with.
Marge,You're an idiot.
Marge,You are the first person who ever said that!
Marge,"Whatever you say, little boy."
Marge,What's his name again?
Marge,"Oh, Homie."
Marge,"Promenade? With you? Forget it, bub!"
Marge,Wait nicely!
Marge,Oh Homie! / Oh Homie!
Marge,"I feel like a ghost the way you haven't been paying attention to me. Plus, I'm dead."
Marge,Won't the other Homer be a problem?
Marge,"This is all your fault, Homer, for wanting somebody new!"
Marge,Doctor Marvin Monroe?! Are you alive or dead?
Marge,"Well, I think you're helping us make progress."
Marge,Let's not fight anymore. Let's just make him decide between us.
Marge,"Those are great reasons, but there's one reason you should choose me. Because I know everything that you've done, and yet I still want to be with you."
Marge,"Because we have no way of communicating with the outside world! Tell me, has Robert Fulton invented the steamboat yet?"
Marge,"Homie, someone owes me a back scratch."
Marge,She doesn't know what a good thing she's got. I like a man who can relax. Not like Grumpy-Lumpy there.
Marge,"Choose me because I'm not bitter yet, I can stay up later, and you're on my mind all the time."
Marge,That is so beautiful.
Marge,"SIDE-BY-SIDE ON MY PIANO KEYBOARD / OH LORD, WHY DON'T WE..."
Marge,Everything's fine! Cupcakes and sprinkles!
Marge,It was my fault! I... I walked into a door.
Marge,"Stop, Homer! Please!"
Marge,My eye!
Marge,"No, it can't be! I would never hurt Marge! I'm a good man!"
Marge,Homer?! I wasn't expecting you.
Marge,"Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way."
Marge,"Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way."
Marge,Duffman!
Marge,Duffman?
Marge,Diamonds! I still can't believe he gave me diamonds!
Marge,"Freeze him out. It's cold in Marge's doghouse, baby."
Marge,My sisters are nuts. I'm happy being married to Homer. Most of the time.
Marge,Should I forgive him?...
Marge,Maybe not this time...
Marge,"With his marriage in this much trouble, he's got a lot of thinking to do."
Marge,I should say something reassuring yet noncommittal.
Marge,We've got a winning hand. We can take the rest of the tricks!
Marge,"Ooh, you'd better be careful. The purpose of this game is to make friends. You don't make friends by winning."
Marge,"Still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious winner."
Marge,"Don't ask me, I'm just hair. Your head stopped eighteen inches ago."
Marge,"This place is so boring. If somebody doesn't do something interesting, I'm gonna have to. But what?"
Marge,How much money did he piss away on this?
Marge,This sure beats slaving over a hot stove!
Marge,Where is he?! Where is he?!
Marge,He cares so much about those doggone dugongs. I wish I felt that kind of passion. Maybe I should join him on his mission...
Marge,Darn these long bank lines. Although it does give me a moment with my thoughts. Darn these long bank lines.
Marge,Hm... could this show help me with eating cheating?
Marge,"Hm, the kids are acting awfully strange. Maybe I should sit down with them and-- Homer, where are you going?!"
Marge,"Gosh, what a hunk!"
Marge,That'll stop her from seeing him.
Marge,"I know what Homer's thinking. He's thinking that he really wants a baby now. So this should be the time, ironically, that I'll change my mind and not want one. Well, no way! I want one more than ever!"
Marge,"Man, things sure have turned to crap."
Marge,"Oh no, he yawned -- I'm boring him!"
Marge,Is he making chicken noises?
Marge,"C'mon, Marge, it's either you, or..."
Marge,Chip!
Marge,"Lisa, tell your father."
Marge,"Homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There's a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy."
Marge,That was our wedding.
Marge,"Children, it's time for you to go to bed."
Marge,"Homie, did you straighten everything out...?"
Marge,Homer! You promised!
Marge,"Homer, please. We've never thrown a party. Now we're gonna pay back all the friends who've invited us to their homes."
Marge,Oh! They're here! How does everything look?
Marge,Do we have enough glasses?
Marge,Homer! Homer! Put a record on!
Marge,Children! Go!
Marge,"Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?"
Marge,I must apologize for my husband.
Marge,"Hmmm. thank you. I will, Dr. Hibbert. Thanks for coming."
Marge,I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
Marge,Come here!
Marge,Shhh.
Marge,"I want to make sure the kids don't hear. When I was young, I always hated knowing my parents were fighting."
Marge,"Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?"
Marge,"Homer, I like to think that I'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!"
Marge,I'm going to church alone today. You're going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life.
Marge,We'll be there!
Marge,We're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that's all. No fishing.
Marge,"Oh, that must be the babysitter."
Marge,Hello. I'm Mrs. Simpson.
Marge,Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
Marge,Grampa?
Marge,"Grampa, could you do something?"
Marge,"Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate."
Marge,"Now, if Maggie runs a fever, you call this number. If she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. And if she drinks pine cleanser, call this..."
Marge,"All right. All right. Goodbye, children. And behave yourselves."
Marge,Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub.
Marge,"Hello, Reverend. We're glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen."
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,"Well, it's not that I don't love the guy. I'm always sticking up for him. It's just that he's so self-centered."
Marge,"He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes..."
Marge,"He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle..."
Marge,"... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that's it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That's all I can think of right now. I guess you're all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest."
Marge,"Homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? I can't believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. You're thinking about fishing, even when I'm talking... right now. Right?"
Marge,Yes.
Marge,Get back in bed.
Marge,Sure.
Marge,Homer?
Marge,Do I have to do this?
Marge,"We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe...."
Marge,To who?
Marge,All this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
Marge,"Oh yeah, sure."
Marge,"Ohhh, Homer."
Marge,"Oh my, the house looks wonderful. Grampa, what's your secret?"
Marge,"Kids, could you lighten up a little?"
Marge,We're here!
Marge,"So, did you kids have fun?"
Marge,Ohhh.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Don't gloat, Homer. You know, Bart, when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents wouldn't give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma..."
Marge,"For months, I worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked..."
Marge,"But the big day finally came. And because I'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good."
Marge,So maybe a part-time job is the answer.
Marge,The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
Marge,I don't think so.
Marge,Did you make any money?
Marge,"Well, I think what you're doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn't have anybody."
Marge,I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
Marge,"Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?"
Marge,"Boys, you better come in the house. You don't want to get the sniffles."
Marge,Now come on... You can play your little tie-up game inside. I've got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows?
Marge,"What are you doing, honey?"
Marge,"Lisa, we did the best we could... What's a zebu?"
Marge,A-Positive.
Marge,A mother knows everything about her family.
Marge,Four B.
Marge,"Sixteen permanent, eight baby."
Marge,XL.
Marge,"I don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three."
Marge,Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.
Marge,Glow in the dark monster make-up.
Marge,"Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type?"
Marge,Bart does.
Marge,"Bart, you have to help someone in need. It's the only decent thing to do."
Marge,The meaning of what?
Marge,"Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand."
Marge,We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance.
Marge,But he's your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute?
Marge,"You're still angry, Homer. Why don't you sleep on it?"
Marge,"Please, Homie? For me?"
Marge,Homer... Breakfast is ready.
Marge,Oh... thank you.
Marge,"Homer, I don't think it's in the cornstarch canister."
Marge,"Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself."
Marge,"Honey, what's done is done. No matter what happens, we'll pull through. We always do."
Marge,"Oh, my! It's Mr. Burns."
Marge,It doesn't do anything.
Marge,"Whatever it does, it's doing it now."
Marge,"Homer, it's the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, ""A good deed is its own reward."""
Marge,"Well then, I guess the moral is, ""No good deed goes unrewarded."""
Marge,"Well... then I guess the moral is, ""The squeaky wheel gets the grease."""
Marge,But it certainly was a memorable few days!
Marge,"Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry."
Marge,Maggie!
Marge,"Bart, I asked you to watch your sister!"
Marge,I washed it.
Marge,"Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts."
Marge,I don't know how this could have happened.
Marge,"Homer, please. No one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work."
Marge,"Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I can't fill this out for you."
Marge,Oh my God! Mother was right.
Marge,I told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house.
Marge,I said crazy house!
Marge,Crazy house!
Marge,Crazy house!
Marge,"Doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, Bart, you'd see how sane he is."
Marge,"Oh, Homie."
Marge,"Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest."
Marge,"No, it is not the truth, Homer. It's well documented that women are safer drivers than men."
Marge,You've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.
Marge,"Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article."
Marge,Homie... Put down your magazine for a minute...
Marge,I thought you might want to snuggle.
Marge,"Thank you, Homie."
Marge,It certainly has enriched our lives.
Marge,"Bart, maybe this is something you'd like to do, too."
Marge,"How's it going, honey?"
Marge,"Well, when I used to get stuck like this, I'd go for a bike ride. Do kids go on bike rides anymore?"
Marge,"I don't know, I thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore. Do kids still use that word, ""cool""?"
Marge,"Oooh, look, Homer. The IRS."
Marge,"Here we are, kids! The Watergate."
Marge,"Homer, look! They give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... Ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow."
Marge,"Wow, the President's bathroom!"
Marge,"Lisa, the contest isn't for three hours."
Marge,"I know, honey, but just sit still."
Marge,"Lisa, what's gotten into you?"
Marge,Imprisoned Congressman becomes born-again Christian.
Marge,"No, that was about the budget gap. This is the trading gap."
Marge,I think it means he's having a barbecue.
Marge,"He's trying to be friendly. You know, if you gave Ned Flanders a chance --"
Marge,"We can't hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do --"
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,"Hi, Ned. Homer sends his apologies, but uh... there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of."
Marge,"Bart, how many hours a day do you watch TV?"
Marge,Don't you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise?
Marge,"That's the problem. Even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves."
Marge,"That sounds fine, Bart."
Marge,"So Bart, what did you learn in karate school today?"
Marge,"Bart, don't use the touch of death on your sister."
Marge,"Homer, this is the Flanders' entire living room set. How much did you pay for this?"
Marge,Seventy-five dollars? Ned must be desperate!
Marge,You got a job? Doing what?
Marge,"Bart, your father and I don't want you doing that. Homer, say something."
Marge,Homer? Homer!
Marge,"I know it's good for a boy to have a part-time job, but I'm not sure about the people Bart's working for. I thinks they're criminals."
Marge,"Well, Bart's been acting very strangely. And that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks."
Marge,How long does it take to deliver a pizza?
Marge,"Homer, I want you to go down to that club and talk to them. Just see what kind of people they are. Please, Homie?"
Marge,"Homer, what did you find out?"
Marge,"Oh, Bart. Why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys."
Marge,Principal Skinner!
Marge,"Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us."
Marge,Oh my Lord!
Marge,"Homie, please be all right."
Marge,"Dear Lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian. I don't know what I can do... Ummm, oooh, the next time there's a canned food drive I'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix."
Marge,"Homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? And what's all this?"
Marge,"""For heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... Employee-of-the-Month!"" Ohh, Homer!"
Marge,"How are you enjoying your ham, Homie?"
Marge,"Hmm, it's actually more of a honey glaze --"
Marge,"Bart, don't feed your sister hotels!"
Marge,I think that game is too old for her. Why don't you go play with Milhouse?
Marge,You mean you still haven't made up with him?
Marge,"Mrs. Van Houten, I'm Bart's mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint."
Marge,"Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things..."
Marge,"Well, I can't defend everything he does. But let's face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They're too young for girls. And they're a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they're always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends!"
Marge,"Well, I knew his mother would come to her senses.."
Marge,What makes you think I did it?
Marge,You be good.
Marge,Hello?
Marge,"Oh hello, Mrs. Pennycandy."
Marge,"Oh, dear. This is the fifth time he's cancelled. How can he hurt someone who loves him so?"
Marge,"Well, thank you for calling. Good-bye."
Marge,"Sweetie, I'm sorry, but Krusty isn't coming to dinner again."
Marge,"Bart, wipe your feet."
Marge,I've got some good news. Krusty the Clown is coming to dinner tonight.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,Who wants to say grace?
Marge,"Krusty, why don't you tell us what's wrong? You'll feel better."
Marge,"Well, look at the time. Almost midnight."
Marge,"Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home."
Marge,We're home!
Marge,"Now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for..."
Marge,If you eat too much you'll have nightmares.
Marge,Look everybody! My purse exploded!
Marge,"Ugghh, Homer. Where did you get that ugly thing?"
Marge,"Homer, there's something I don't like about that severed hand."
Marge,"Oh, my land!"
Marge,"Ooh, a new pacifier."
Marge,"Homer, maybe fame and fortune aren't as bad as they say."
Marge,"Oh Homer, this is awful."
Marge,"Good morning, dear."
Marge,"Much better! Oh good, the curtains are on fire!"
Marge,Now hadn't you better get ready for school?
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"That's it, young man. You're coming with me..."
Marge,Please?
Marge,"My goodness, what's wrong?"
Marge,"It's your father, he's missing."
Marge,He's been gone for two days.
Marge,"Did you have a nightmare, Homie?"
Marge,"Don't worry, honey, I'm sure your father is..."
Marge,Maybe.
Marge,No.
Marge,That's a long shot.
Marge,Bingo.
Marge,"Don't worry, he'll be here."
Marge,"Look Homer, Lisa's taking her first steps."
Marge,Yes.
Marge,"Did you hear that, Homer?"
Marge,"Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her."
Marge,"Homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you."
Marge,We can't afford to buy a pony.
Marge,That's ridiculous.
Marge,That's no reason to buy a pony!
Marge,Stick to the subject.
Marge,Let's be realistic. A pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is.
Marge,You sound like you're going to buy a pony. Promise me you won't.
Marge,What was that? Was that a yes or a no?
Marge,Those aren't even words!
Marge,I am very upset with you.
Marge,"Homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?"
Marge,That's illegal.
Marge,"Hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries."
Marge,"Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer."
Marge,Then I'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back.
Marge,Homer...
Marge,"All right. You got us into this, you get us out."
Marge,"Homer, where have you been? I was so worried."
Marge,"Homie, how long do you plan to do this?"
Marge,Thirty years?
Marge,"He's just exhausted. Lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony?"
Marge,"Well, it's a lot. In fact, your father had to take a second job."
Marge,The Kwik-E-Mart.
Marge,"Lisa, I hope you realize that your father can't keep this up."
Marge,"Lisa, we can't make you give up that pony."
Marge,"No, Bart. No one's going to make her. This is something Lisa has to decide for herself."
Marge,"Homer, can you get the door? It's my sisters."
Marge,"Homer, be nice."
Marge,"What's the matter, can't you find a hair style you like?"
Marge,Ed Asner?
Marge,"Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again?"
Marge,Who's using the power tools?
Marge,"Well, we're going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I'm gone."
Marge,I don't know.
Marge,"Homie, we're back."
Marge,"Homer, could you turn off the TV? There's a little test I want you to take."
Marge,This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
Marge,"Question one: ""Name one of your child's friends..."""
Marge,"They want a name, Homer, not a vague description."
Marge,Hank?! Hank who?
Marge,"Homer, you made that up. Question two: ""Who is your son's hero?"""
Marge,"That's your hero. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
Marge,What are your son's hobbies?
Marge,He hasn't done that since he was two.
Marge,"Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see."
Marge,"Now, don't pout."
Marge,Don't you at least have something to say to Bart?
Marge,Homer! I've always said you were a good father. I've always defended you when people put you down.
Marge,But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father.
Marge,"Bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner."
Marge,"Honey, what's wrong?"
Marge,"Homie, why don't you just go down to Moe's and talk to him? I bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you."
Marge,"So, Mr. Hutz, does my husband have a case?"
Marge,"Well Homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy."
Marge,"Well, duh."
Marge,"Bart, are you going to moe the lawn today?"
Marge,"I moe, I moe."
Marge,Of course. All work and moe play makes Moe a moe moe.
Marge,Bart! Bart! Turn to the financial channel! Aunt Patty says our stock is skyrocketing!
Marge,Your father's stock is worth fifty-two hundred dollars!
Marge,It's the miracle we've been waiting for.
Marge,"We'll have a savings account. We've never had one. Kids, I think everything is going to be okay from now on."
Marge,"Oh, Homer!"
Marge,We heard! Isn't it wonderful? We have some great plans for that money.
Marge,What do you mean?
Marge,You spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer?
Marge,Look at all those worried faces -- except for Lenny. He looks great.
Marge,"Homie, come to bed."
Marge,"Don't worry. Whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow."
Marge,"Well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive?"
Marge,"Now, Bart, Lisa did a wonderful job on my hair and we saved forty dollars for the family. We all have to pull together 'til your father gets a new job."
Marge,That's very clever.
Marge,"Hmmm, you shouldn't do that."
Marge,"That's good, Lisa."
Marge,"I want you to take baths, Bart."
Marge,"Bart, I want you to go down to Moe's Tavern. I need you to bring your father home."
Marge,"""Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test""? Homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?"
Marge,"Okay, let's see... ""Ahoy maties! If the water turns blue, a baby for you. If purple ye see, no baby thar be""."
Marge,Pink.
Marge,"""If ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail"". Well, I guess I'd better go see Dr. Hibbert."
Marge,"Well, I have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix I did with the other kids."
Marge,"Well, I'll let you know."
Marge,"Hmmm, what do you think about?"
Marge,It's Homer!
Marge,You don't know Homer like I do. He's sensitive and sweet.
Marge,"Homer, do you ever think about the future?"
Marge,"No, I mean how you plan to earn a living. I can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating."
Marge,"I think about you, too."
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,YOU LIGHT UP MY DAYS / AND FILL MY NIGHTS / WITH SONG.... IT CAN'T BE WRONG / WHEN IT FEELS SO GOO/RIGHT / CAUSE YOU -- YOU
Marge,Our song.
Marge,"Actually, she was singing about God."
Marge,You don't have to do that.
Marge,"Homer, maybe it's the Champale talking, but I think you're pretty sexy."
Marge,What if we get caught?
Marge,"I need you to drive me to the doctor, Homer."
Marge,"Well, that unforgettable night we... joined the Castle Club..."
Marge,So You've Ruined Your Life.
Marge,"Well, I haven't said no to you lately, have I?"
Marge,What card?
Marge,Is this it?
Marge,"""Marge, from the first moment I saw you I never wanted to be with anyone else. I don't have much to offer you... except all my love. Will you marry me?"""
Marge,"Oh, Homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
Marge,Yes.
Marge,"Homer, I've been thinking. If the baby's a boy, what do you think of the name Larry?"
Marge,"Well, how about Louie?"
Marge,Bob?
Marge,Luke?
Marge,Marcus?
Marge,What about Bart?
Marge,There certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.
Marge,"Homer, I'd be lying if I said that this is how I pictured my wedding day... But you are how I pictured my husband."
Marge,"Well, you may not look like Ted Bessell, but you're just as nice."
Marge,Marge.
Marge,I do.
Marge,What a perfect day.
Marge,"Homer, I don't know how we can afford all these things on your salary."
Marge,I don't know. I heard radiation can make you sterile.
Marge,Did you get the job?
Marge,"Oh, Homie. Hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking."
Marge,"""Fourth Notice""... ""90 Days Overdue""... ""We Break Thumbs""... Homer, what are we going to do?"
Marge,Oh dear...
Marge,"""You will not see me again until I am a man."" Oh, Homer, Homer."
Marge,Homer ?!
Marge,I heard a noise outside and thought it might be Homer.
Marge,My husband by my side.
Marge,Homer?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Homer... Come home with me.
Marge,Any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
Marge,Aww...
Marge,Would you mind if I took it off now? The oil is burning my finger.
Marge,"Homer, do you know why I married you?"
Marge,"No, because I love you."
Marge,Come home soon.
Marge,"Homer, does this mean --"
Marge,Doesn't your job start tomorrow?
Marge,"Homer, that's -- Ohh!"
Marge,"Homer, for God's sakes, let him deliver the baby!"
Marge,"Homie, isn't he beautiful?"
Marge,How could he? He's only ten minutes old.
Marge,"Homer, I'm not pregnant."
Marge,Yes!
Marge,"Bart, your Grampa's on the phone. He wants to wish you a happy birthday."
Marge,Bart! Be polite.
Marge,Wha'd you say? I can't understand you with all that distortion.
Marge,"Y'know Bart, I don't think this is such a bad present. Maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does."
Marge,"Testing... testing... One, two, three... Oh, my. Do I sound like that?"
Marge,I bet you could have a lot of fun with this. Why don't you go show your father?
Marge,"I'll get some at the store tomorrow, Homer."
Marge,"Maggie! You talked! Can you say ""mama"" again?"
Marge,"Oh, Bart."
Marge,"Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little Timmy O'Toole, trapped in that well."
Marge,Bart! What's wrong with you?
Marge,What are you doing to save my baby boy?
Marge,"Well, why don't you get it?"
Marge,You're telling me that the city won't pay to get a boy out of a well?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Bart? Honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're down in the well."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Sting, you look tired. Maybe you should take a rest."
Marge,"Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums--"
Marge,"Oh Bart, I've missed you so much."
Marge,"Homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart."
Marge,"Oh, look at that, a shoe box house. Lisa, you're so clever."
Marge,Well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does?
Marge,"Hmmm, well, if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap. I do it all the time. I pretend I'm interested in looking at power tools, going to those silly car chase movies, and... some things I'll tell you about when you're older. Do you understand?"
Marge,Bart!
Marge,Bart?
Marge,"I was thinking that while your father and Lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping."
Marge,Oh really?
Marge,Hmm...
Marge,"Now Bart, I think you'd look very sharp in this shirt."
Marge,"No, no, no, you have to try it on."
Marge,"Oooh, and this one's fifty percent off."
Marge,"Well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend. Ooh this looks good.... oh and this one is very, very cute... And these... Oh look! Little bow ties."
Marge,And don't make that face at me.
Marge,See how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
Marge,Bart?
Marge,"Oh Bart, you could use some new underwear too."
Marge,Did you two have fun?
Marge,"Well, we had fun too. Right now, Bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends."
Marge,Look at these prices. We could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.
Marge,"Homer, I can't help wondering where you're getting the money from?"
Marge,"Hmm, I guess so."
Marge,"Ooh, perfume. Meryl Streep's ""Versatility."""
Marge,"Homer, those are very thoughtful presents. But you have to tell me where you got the money from."
Marge,"I promise I will get mad, because I always do when you make me promise I won't."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,I did not! I promised I would get mad! She's an eight-year-old girl.
Marge,But gambling is illegal.
Marge,"Well, I just don't know."
Marge,You're a very selfish man.
Marge,"Homer, I think that chip's got enough dip on it."
Marge,"I am not cleaning that... Ah, who am I kidding?"
Marge,"Now Maggie, when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want."
Marge,"Extra mustard for Bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust... Double bologna for Homer...."
Marge,One at a time! One at a time!
Marge,That's enough!
Marge,"There you go, Lisa. No pimentos. Bart, your hat's where you left it, behind the toilet. Homer, I'll sew your pants but I'm out of bologna."
Marge,"Videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, Homer's dry-cleaning -- I think that's everything."
Marge,"Homer, I'm running late as it is. Can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?"
Marge,"Alright, don't whine. Just put it in my left hand."
Marge,Kids! Hurry up or you're going to miss your bus!
Marge,Get out.
Marge,Fruit leather... Tree Fresh Imitation Orange Drink... Krusty brand duck sausage pizza...
Marge,AHHH!!
Marge,NOOOOOOOO!!
Marge,Homer? Is that you?
Marge,Okay.
Marge,That's nice. Do you think you could loosen my cuffs?
Marge,Homer
Marge,I need a vacation.
Marge,I need to unwind.
Marge,No. I mean a vacation by myself.
Marge,"No Homie, no. I still love you. A lot of couples take separate vacations."
Marge,I swear.
Marge,Thanks again for taking the children while I'm away.
Marge,"Homer, can you bring Maggie out?"
Marge,Homer! If Maggie really doesn't want to leave the house maybe she should just stay with you.
Marge,"Goodbye, Homie."
Marge,Check the dryer!
Marge,Whenever she needs it.
Marge,Don't.
Marge,Uh-huh.
Marge,Hi Homie. I feel much better.
Marge,"""Bungee jumping, kayaking, calligraphy, cigar making, hula dancing... hmm... I guess I've done everything."
Marge,Uh-huh.
Marge,Oh.
Marge,"Hello, room service? This is Marge Simpson. I'd like a hot fudge sundae. With whipped cream. And some chocolate chip cheesecake. And a bottle of tequila."
Marge,"Homer, that's awful!"
Marge,"Well, good. I'm coming home, honey. You can pick me up at the train station in an hour. And bring the kids. Bye!"
Marge,"Hi, did you miss me?"
Marge,I missed you too.
Marge,And from now on I hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to.
Marge,"Well, I could use a little more. And sometimes I want a little time to myself, and I expect you to help --"
Marge,What? Name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks.
Marge,Maybe we should let the dog in?
Marge,I think he needs a dog house.
Marge,I'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.
Marge,I am not!
Marge,"Oh, I don't know..."
Marge,"How was detention today, dear?"
Marge,Of course I saved them.
Marge,"Although actually there's only one. And it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited."
Marge,"Well, you know, maybe he's right."
Marge,"Actually, Homer, you brought up Ned Flanders. I never said a word --"
Marge,"No, you're not. When my father got out of the Navy, he used to curse a blue streak. It almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. So, my mom put a Swear Jar in the kitchen. Every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. What do you think?"
Marge,"Yes, Homer."
Marge,"No, Homer."
Marge,"Yes, Homer."
Marge,Uh... that's okay.
Marge,"There was more than enough in the swear jar. And if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise."
Marge,"No, behind her."
Marge,Where's Maggie? Where's Maggie?
Marge,There's Maggie!
Marge,"Oh, my special little guy has a sweetheart."
Marge,"Homer! Bart, you did a very cruel thing."
Marge,"No, Homer. The truth would humiliate her."
Marge,We'll all help.
Marge,"That's disgusting. And besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face."
Marge,"Homer, for the last time, I am not putting that in."
Marge,"Oh, that's very good, Lisa."
Marge,How shall we end it?
Marge,"Oh, that's sweet."
Marge,"Homie, come to bed."
Marge,"Homer, go back to the garage."
Marge,And the next man wants to hit the ball too. And he does. And there he goes off in that direction. And everyone is happy.
Marge,That's all right dear. I can do it.
Marge,You hit so many home runs this year. What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better than you?
Marge,"Oh, Homie. You're good at lots of things."
Marge,Like snuggling...
Marge,"Children, that's not very nice."
Marge,"Oh, dear."
Marge,"Children, tell me when your father stops scratching himself. Kids?"
Marge,"Oh, dear."
Marge,"Ohh, well, I guess he'll be happy when he comes to."
Marge,"Lisa, it's not that bad."
Marge,"That's nice, Bart. You know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. But they said he was too heavy."
Marge,"Honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help."
Marge,So you think she has talent?
Marge,Do you think she could be a professional some day?
Marge,"Morning, honey."
Marge,"Lisa, I know you're down on homemaking, but it can really let you be creative. See, this morning I turned bacon, eggs and toast into a nice smiley face for Bart and Homer."
Marge,"Oh well, you'd be surprised."
Marge,Bad dog! Very bad dog.
Marge,"Oh... Oh... Unng... Oh, Bart."
Marge,"Lisa, why aren't you at band practice?"
Marge,"Oh, honey, right now you're discouraged. But deep down, you know you love the saxophone. I think you should stay in the band."
Marge,"Lisa, there are a lot of people in the world who like to tell you what you can't do. But they don't always know what they're talking about."
Marge,"So you see, my sisters were wrong. Except about the cities on the moon. I was wrong about that. So... well, you can see how anyone can be wrong."
Marge,Bart's grades are up a little this term. But Lisa's are way down.
Marge,"We have three kids, Homer."
Marge,"No, Maggie!"
Marge,But we never ever...
Marge,I buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. We each play our birthday. And that's enough excitement for me.
Marge,"Homer, we're on a tight budget here. Promise me you won't get carried away."
Marge,You can still win some money if you have five out of six.
Marge,"Homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one."
Marge,"Oh well... we lost the money, but at least we've still got each other."
Marge,"Well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick."
Marge,"Hmm, how much will it cost?"
Marge,Oh dear!
Marge,"Oh, honey. Seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. We really can't afford this operation."
Marge,I know you're upset --
Marge,"Bart, watch your language. Oh. You did. Sorry."
Marge,No.
Marge,You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself.
Marge,I've found a way we can pay for the operation.
Marge,"No. I'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. Homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while."
Marge,"Bart, from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at Springfield Barber College."
Marge,"I'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and I found a way to stretch the food budget. Fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. Ham night will be Spam night. And porkchop night..."
Marge,... will now be chub night.
Marge,"Lisa, I'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of Encyclopedia Generica from the grocery store."
Marge,"We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer..."
Marge,I don't think you've thought this through.
Marge,You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly just snouts and entrails.
Marge,What's that?
Marge,"Oh no! Those are my numbers! If it wasn't for that dog, I would've won!"
Marge,Not now.
Marge,"Homie, did you close the gate?"
Marge,The dog will get out!
Marge,Here boy!
Marge,Not one that I want the public to see.
Marge,"Homer get a-hold of yourself. Even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. Remember Doggie Heaven."
Marge,You can pet the cat.
Marge,"Oh, there's a spot, dear."
Marge,"That spot says ""compact only""."
Marge,"So, what are we going to see?"
Marge,"Well, since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie, your dad and I will pick a movie, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. Hmm?"
Marge,Maybe we could see something a little more adult.
Marge,"Ooh! The paper called it a ""taut political thriller""."
Marge,Well of course he's a spy. You just saw him go through spy school!
Marge,"Oh, shut up, Homer! No one wants to hear what you think!"
Marge,"Homer, if it makes you feel any better, most of what they threw at you splattered on me. Homer?..."
Marge,"Homie, aren't you coming inside?"
Marge,Where were you all night?
Marge,You should have called. I was very worried.
Marge,"Well, it's nice. But who is this woman?"
Marge,I don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!
Marge,I don't want to. I'm mad at you.
Marge,"I'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing."
Marge,Homer! Where did you get that suit?
Marge,Was it Lurleen?
Marge,Don't lie to me. Are you having an affair with this woman?
Marge,Have you kissed her?
Marge,Has she kissed you?
Marge,I want you to stop seeing her.
Marge,Her manager? That's ridiculous. I won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
Marge,Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. And you did it at the county fair last year. Remember?
Marge,Fine. See if I care.
Marge,"Homer, how much did you just give that man?"
Marge,Mrs. Homer Simpson.
Marge,Hmmm. I thought you said she was overweight!
Marge,What does that mean?
Marge,"All our money's tied up in this woman. If she fails, we're broke. If she succeeds, I have no husband. I don't know what to root for."
Marge,I gotta go. Homer...
Marge,"Just so you know, while you and Lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, Maggie cut her first tooth."
Marge,You're not even listening to me!
Marge,"Kids, will you come in here?"
Marge,"You've got a wonderful family, Homer. Please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight."
Marge,I'll love you for the rest of my life.
Marge,Homer?
Marge,Always has been.
Marge,I do.
Marge,"Now kids, I know you're all excited about meeting Aunt Selma's new boyfriend tonight."
Marge,"Now, now, he's an ex-convict. He's paid his debt to society."
Marge,I'm just not.
Marge,"That's them. Now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity."
Marge,"Selma, I've never seen you so happy. Giggling like a schoolgirl."
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"Now, about your wedding dress. I'm not sure how to put this..."
Marge,White. And what would you like for appetizers?
Marge,"Okay, we've got cocktail wienies and Swedish meatballs."
Marge,"Ah, that's sweet."
Marge,"There, there..."
Marge,Bart! Stop that.
Marge,"Oooh, there's Krusty the Clown! Krusty, Krusty, say something funny."
Marge,Because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.
Marge,I guess you're just too young to understand.
Marge,"Go ahead, Patty."
Marge,"Well, he fooled almost everyone. But there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust."
Marge,My little guy's first rock concert. I hope the Spinal Taps don't play too loud.
Marge,"Hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything."
Marge,"Hmmm, I hope my poor little baby's okay."
Marge,"Oh, oh... thank God!"
Marge,We'll discuss it later. Is Milhouse okay?
Marge,"Homer, I've been thinking about what Bart said. If he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should BUY him A GUITAR."
Marge,I meant a real guitar.
Marge,And it came with a free instruction book.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Bart, what's going on?"
Marge,What conversation?
Marge,That's not my voice!
Marge,I don't understand this. Why can't you stay with your parents?
Marge,"I know we didn't ask for this, Homer, but doesn't the Bible say, ""Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"""
Marge,"Otto, you can't just sit there watching TV all day."
Marge,No.
Marge,No.
Marge,"Otto, I think you should get a job."
Marge,So get that piece of paper!
Marge,"I know how you feel, but he is good with the kids."
Marge,"But Homer, we're the only family he's got..."
Marge,"Well, before you do that, maybe you should take the driving test again."
Marge,I wish they had never invented fried cheese!
Marge,"Oh, Homer, I love you just the way you are. Lisa, what's that number?"
Marge,"Operator, I'd like to place an order for my husband."
Marge,Hmmm... Hostage negotiations.
Marge,Better give me the weight loss tape.
Marge,"Homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite?"
Marge,Don't you usually play with Milhouse after school?
Marge,Milhouse?
Marge,How cute. They don't open their mouths do they?
Marge,How cute.
Marge,I don't know if that tape is working. You ate three desserts tonight.
Marge,There's another thing I've been wanting to talk to you about...
Marge,What in God's name are you talking about?
Marge,Oh.
Marge,You mean a spoon?
Marge,"How was your day at work, dear?"
Marge,Hands across America...
Marge,"This chair is $2,000. We could buy a whole living room set for that."
Marge,This money was a blessing. We can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
Marge,Herb! How have you been?
Marge,Can't complain.
Marge,"Homer, he knows how to work a light switch."
Marge,I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel.
Marge,Maybe we should play another game.
Marge,That was your idea.
Marge,"Well, I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer."
Marge,"Homer, wait. Herb, what're you talking about?"
Marge,That's a very clever idea!
Marge,Whoooa!!
Marge,"Well, it's pretty ingrained."
Marge,"Maggie, you talked!"
Marge,"Homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these."
Marge,"Don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. He is your brother."
Marge,"Herb, I appreciate your generosity, but I don't need any gift from you."
Marge,"Homie, you do remember your promise to the children?"
Marge,"Bart, where's your bathing suit?"
Marge,You're what?
Marge,"It's our last family dinner for six weeks, but I promised myself I wouldn't cry."
Marge,"Oh, I'm going to miss this."
Marge,"Good-bye my special little guy. Lisa, watch out for poison ivy. Remember, ""Leaves of 3, let it be."
Marge,"You can have the shower to yourself, Homie. I'm finished."
Marge,Ohhh...
Marge,Whoa!!
Marge,"Oh, that's wonderful."
Marge,"Dear kids, I hope this letter finds you well. We are doing great. Your father is in the best shape he's been since...well, ever."
Marge,We miss you terribly. I hope these jelly bean cookies will tide you over until you get home.
Marge,"She complains now, but when we go to pick her up, she won't want to leave."
Marge,"Oh... Homer, it's getting late, we'll miss the fireworks."
Marge,"Kids, I won't be home tonight, So I'm leaving you some low-cal microwavable TV dinners."
Marge,"I'm auditioning for a play! It's a musical version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" Isn't that exciting?"
Marge,"I haven't been in a play since high school, and I thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults."
Marge,"You know, I spend all day alone with Maggie... and sometimes it's like I don't even exist."
Marge,La-la-la-la-la-la-la.
Marge,"Homer, my audition is in half..."
Marge,I'm auditioning for a play.
Marge,"I told you several times. It's a musical version of ""A Streetcar Named..."""
Marge,Well... I thought I told you..
Marge,"I'm sorry, Honey."
Marge,"Hi, Ned. I didn't know you were an actor."
Marge,Maybe I should have taken a nice calligraphy class.
Marge,Love...
Marge,"Homie, I didn't get the part... you were right, outside interests are stupid."
Marge,"I'll come home right away. All right, I'll pick up a bucket of fried chicken... extra skin, rolls, chocolate cream parfait..."
Marge,I play an aging southern beauty who's driven to insanity by her brutish brother-in-law Stanley.
Marge,I don't think so.
Marge,"No, Homer."
Marge,"I'm Marge Simpson, I'll be playing Blanche. I made some peanut butter brownies for everyone."
Marge,"Well, I guess a few weeks wouldn't hurt her."
Marge,"Maggie is allergic to strained pears, and she likes a bottle of warm milk before naptime..."
Marge,Ba-ba?
Marge,That sounds awfully harsh.
Marge,"Oh, well. Be a good girl, Maggie."
Marge,"Stanley, stop or I'll tell Stella."
Marge,I'll twist this bottle in your face...
Marge,"Homer, can you run some lines with me?"
Marge,It'll just take a sec.
Marge,"I'm sorry, Llewellyn. I just... I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face. Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor?"
Marge,"Homer, it'll just be a few minutes more!"
Marge,"Stanley stop, or I'll tell Stella."
Marge,I just don't see what's so bad about Stanley.
Marge,I'll twist this bottle in your face!
Marge,"Heah you ah, Homah."
Marge,The play's tomorrow night. Ah've got to stay in character.
Marge,It maght.
Marge,"That reahlly doesn't help, Baht."
Marge,"See you later, kids. Ah've got to go rehearse with Ned."
Marge,"For God's sake, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!"
Marge,"Keep yelling, you big ape."
Marge,Forget about him. Let's rehearse the bottle scene!
Marge,Why? Are you going?
Marge,"I'm sure you won't enjoy it. There's nothing about bowling in the play... Oh wait, there is."
Marge,Why can't you be a little more supportive?
Marge,What kooky projects?
Marge,Why didn't you tell me you felt this way?
Marge,"I'm looking for my sister, Stella."
Marge,My name is Blanche DuBois.
Marge,I THOUGHT MY LIFE WOULD BE A MARDI GRAS/ A NEVER-ENDING PARTY -- HA!/ I'M A FADED SOUTHERN DAME WITHOUT A DIME...
Marge,"Come here. I want to kiss you, just once, softly and sweetly on your mouth."
Marge,"Whoever you are, I have always depended on the kindness of strangers."
Marge,NOW HERE'S A TIP FROM BLANCHE YOU WON'T REGRET...
Marge,Almost everybody.
Marge,"Oh, come on, Homer. By the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up."
Marge,Blanche.
Marge,"Yeah, go on."
Marge,"No, Homer, you got it just right."
Marge,Really?
Marge,"Well, maybe just a little."
Marge,"Get up, Homer. It's time for church."
Marge,It's church. You have to go.
Marge,I'm tired of having this argument every Sunday. Get dressed.
Marge,Come on. We're going to be late.
Marge,Your father is... resting.
Marge,What!? What would help!?
Marge,"That's a terrible thing to say. Kids, your father doesn't really mean that."
Marge,Homer! Are you actually giving up your faith?
Marge,"I can't believe you're giving up church, Homer."
Marge,"Lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. Please show him the error of his ways."
Marge,"No, Homer. He doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, Lord. He just likes to sleep in on Sundays..."
Marge,"Reverend Lovejoy, I had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner."
Marge,"No, it's nothing bad. I'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately."
Marge,"Homer, you're crazy. Tell him this is all crazy."
Marge,"Let's go, kids."
Marge,"I have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, I'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked."
Marge,"Kids, could you wait outside for us?"
Marge,"Homer, please. Don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win."
Marge,I'm only going to ask you one last time. Are you sure you won't come with us to church?
Marge,"Oh, Homey! Are you all right?"
Marge,"Yes, the lesson is..."
Marge,"Oh, Homie, I'm so glad to hear you say that."
Marge,We have one at home. You never use it.
Marge,That is so sweet.
Marge,"Lisa, I know a song that will cheer you up. THERE ONCE WAS AN UGLY DUCKLING..."
Marge,No! No! I meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that makes fun of the ugly one.
Marge,"Homer, Lisa's already sensitive about her looks. This is the last thing she needs."
Marge,You're looking at her through a father's eyes.
Marge,"Honey, no one's going to force you to do anything... but do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant?"
Marge,He sold his ride on the Duff Blimp.
Marge,"Oh, I don't know that she's as attractive as Jack Nicklaus..."
Marge,"Oh. Well, yes, that's what I meant, too. Well, tell you what. This afternoon, I'll take you to the beauty parlor and show you just how lovely you can be."
Marge,I know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight.
Marge,Oh Grampa!
Marge,Who's watching the Kwik-E-Mart?
Marge,Oh dear. It would be a shame if that pretty dress got wet.
Marge,"Homer, those are ice cream men."
Marge,Where'd you get all the money?
Marge,"Grampa, you said that about all the presents."
Marge,"Homer, what's wrong?"
Marge,Oh my God.
Marge,"Your doll is trying to kill my husband!... Yes, I'll hold."
Marge,My name is Marge Bouvier. I'm here about your ad.
Marge,Single white female wanted for mysterious expedition. Must like monkeys. Non-smoker preferred.
Marge,Am I going too?
Marge,What's he saying?
Marge,"Oh, well, isn't that... Whoa!"
Marge,"You keep your hands to yourself, mister."
Marge,I think you're making him angry.
Marge,"Oh hi, Homie."
Marge,"You know, you look a little flushed. Maybe you should eat more vegetables and less people."
Marge,He's not dead.
Marge,"Don't worry, Homie. I'll take care of you."
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,"Now kids, instead of candy, I thought I'd serve an array of healthy fresh fruits."
Marge,Fruit is nature's candy!
Marge,Whoa!
Marge,"Homer, did you barricade the door?"
Marge,It's our only hope.
Marge,"Well, I'm sure glad we didn't turn into mindless zombies."
Marge,"Homer, get back here."
Marge,"Thank you, dear. Now be good for Grampa while we're at the parent/ teacher meeting. We'll bring back dinner."
Marge,That's the way we do it every year.
Marge,Is it 37?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Oh, all right."
Marge,"Well, I'm sorry... I'm sure Bart doesn't really mean to be bad."
Marge,Oh...
Marge,I really don't see how this helps Bart.
Marge,"Homer, we have a problem here."
Marge,We're talking about Bart.
Marge,"Well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in."
Marge,And what if we don't?
Marge,"Oh, my poor baby."
Marge,"Well, we brought some pizza."
Marge,Now this is exactly what Bart's teacher was talking about. Our son did something wrong and you look the other way.
Marge,"Please, Homer. Why do I always have to be the bad guy?"
Marge,"No, no, no."
Marge,"Bart, we're sending you to bed without your supper."
Marge,Bart! Stop being confident.
Marge,We're home.
Marge,"Bart, are you pulling up the carpet?"
Marge,Why are you letting him do this?
Marge,Well punish him!
Marge,How could you let this happen?
Marge,I wasn't here!
Marge,"Homer, do you want your son to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or a sleazy male stripper?"
Marge,Earl Warren wasn't a stripper.
Marge,"Look, you have to help discipline your son."
Marge,Oh my Lord!
Marge,"Homer, we'd like to talk to you."
Marge,"Well, it's been two months. You laid down the law and I'm proud of you. But I think we've gotten through to him."
Marge,"Resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of ""Lemon Time""..."
Marge,"Homer, that's dish washing liquid!"
Marge,Oooh! They're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.
Marge,Did you notice how slanted he looked?
Marge,I think one side of our house is sinking.
Marge,We have to do something...
Marge,I could get a job.
Marge,"Hmm, I think you have to keep your job too."
Marge,We're here for the retirement party.
Marge,Maybe I should apply for that job.
Marge,"Where does the Bible say ""racket?""...."
Marge,"Well, Lisa, I finished my resume."
Marge,What are you putting in there?...
Marge,Chauffeur... seamstress...
Marge,curator of large mammals?
Marge,"Oh, I see."
Marge,Worked for the Carter administration?
Marge,"Lisa, sh! Someone may be listening."
Marge,What?
Marge,Yeah...
Marge,"We need the money, and my life is pretty boring. Last week some Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn't let them leave. They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade."
Marge,But... what do I do?
Marge,I'll just be a minute. I have to finish this paperwork.
Marge,"But, where does it go?"
Marge,Ow!
Marge,Mr. Burns!
Marge,"Oh, aren't you nice. Gee, this makes me wonder why morale here is so low."
Marge,"Well, you could give them healthier snacks... theme days..."
Marge,"Hmm, actually, I was thinking of ""Funny Hat Day."""
Marge,"Oh, and how about piping in some Tom Jones music? That always cheers me up."
Marge,"Homie, what's wrong?"
Marge,"Well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder."
Marge,Oh really? I came to see you three times today. Twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
Marge,Here's your money.
Marge,"Mr. Burns, you want to see me?"
Marge,Oh my goodness!
Marge,My husband will be so excited.
Marge,"Homer, Mr. Burns gave me another raise today."
Marge,You can't fire me just because I'm married. I'm going to sue the pants off you.
Marge,"So, do you think I have a case?"
Marge,It's 9:30 in the morning.
Marge,"Well, I guess that's it. People like us can't afford justice. Come on Homie, let's go before he fires you too."
Marge,oooh...
Marge,That medicine's not for you.
Marge,Gimme that.
Marge,"But I think I'm allergic to seafood. The last time I ate shrimp, my throat closed up and I went into convulsions."
Marge,"Oh, you speak so politely to adults."
Marge,That's sweet.
Marge,"... and finally, Moe's Tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying ""Welcome to Springfield."""
Marge,You could see our house in that photo.
Marge,And this is for the man of the house... which I guess... is you.
Marge,"Hm, what about the bread? Does that have much fish in it?"
Marge,"Well, I have some Tic Tacs in my purse..."
Marge,"Oh, please don't. For me?"
Marge,Don Quixote?
Marge,Don Quixote.
Marge,I really think that was the character's name... Don Quixote!
Marge,"Well, who was it?"
Marge,Mmhmmm.
Marge,"Homer, Bart's at a very curious age. As his father, I think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know."
Marge,Are you sure...?
Marge,"Bart, it's your bedtime. I laid out your jammy-jams."
Marge,"Homer, please I just had eggs."
Marge,"Yes, but it was..."
Marge,We pretty much went straight home.
Marge,"We drove around until 3 a.m. looking for another ""All You Can Eat"" fish restaurant."
Marge,We went fishing.
Marge,"Hi, Homie. It's really starting to snow. I think you should come home."
Marge,I can't believe you bought that plow. We can't afford it.
Marge,Good.
Marge,"Oh, Homie, didn't that hurt?"
Marge,Our driveway's snowed in!
Marge,"I was wrong about you buying that truck. I'm very proud of you, Mr. Plow. ."
Marge,"This might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind..."
Marge,No. No. Could you wear the Mr. Plow jacket. Just uh... for fun.
Marge,"Homie, please don't go."
Marge,"Ohh, now Homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something."
Marge,"Maggie, can you say ba-ba? Can you say Ma-ma?"
Marge,Bart!
Marge,He does not.
Marge,"Kit-ty? ""Kit-ty""?"
Marge,"Hmmm, I don't think so. Oh, Maggie, when are you going to talk?"
Marge,"According to 'Fretful Mother' magazine, if Maggie doesn't talk by age one, we should consider a corrective tongue extender."
Marge,"Uh, well..."
Marge,"You know, I don't think I remember... But the story of Lisa's first word is very cute."
Marge,"Well, this story begins in this unforgettable spring of 1983: Ms. Pac-man struck a blow for women's rights... a young Joe Piscopo taught us how to laugh. Before Lisa was born, we lived in a tiny apartment on the Lower East side of Springfield."
Marge,Did you girls watch the last episode of MASH?
Marge,Then the prince and the princess got married and lived happily ever after.
Marge,"Uh, They had 30 sons and 30 daughters."
Marge,Dennis... Brad... Mavis... Brad...
Marge,"Guess what, Homie... There's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now."
Marge,No.
Marge,We're going to have another baby.
Marge,"Hear that, Bart? You're going to have a little brother or sister to play with!"
Marge,Who did this?
Marge,Bad baby!
Marge,I'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place.
Marge,Won't that warp him?
Marge,You don't have a cousin Frank.
Marge,"That afternoon, we left Bart with my sisters and went househunting."
Marge,Oh dear.
Marge,What's that stench?
Marge,Let's keep looking.
Marge,"We were about to give up, when we found a house that was perfect..."
Marge,Just imagine what we can do with this place.
Marge,"Anyway, Bart had just entered the ""terrible twos."""
Marge,"Oh, honey... honey... honey... HONEY. Could you please be quiet?"
Marge,"Bart, get out!"
Marge,"Bart, from now on, the baby sleeps in the crib."
Marge,Homie... I think the baby's coming.
Marge,"According to this magazine, Bart might be jealous of her."
Marge,"Well, Bart, what do you think of little Lisa?"
Marge,I saved this newspaper from the day Lisa was born.
Marge,Everyone agreed that Lisa was a beautiful baby...
Marge,Here she is!
Marge,"I'm sorry, Bart, you're too little."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Lisa, time for your feed --"
Marge,"Well, I'm not surprised. Lisa's crazy about you. She thinks you hung the moon."
Marge,Bart! Don't write on the rug!
Marge,"Honey, you really shouldn't eat so much in bed."
Marge,It's not good for your heart.
Marge,"Homie, what is it?"
Marge,"Homer, I prepared a special surprise just for you."
Marge,Here you go.
Marge,Nice healthy oatmeal.
Marge,No there isn't.
Marge,"Hello?... Yes... Oh, dear lord! Homer's in the hospital! They think it's his heart."
Marge,"Oh, Homie, I was so frightened."
Marge,Can't you do something for him?
Marge,"Doctor, we'll do whatever it takes to get my Homie well."
Marge,Seventy dollars.
Marge,No. Don't you have health insurance at work?
Marge,"Honey, did you have any luck?"
Marge,"Wait, this might be the answer we're looking for."
Marge,How?
Marge,"Oh, Homie, I don't know. This might upset them."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,I don't know if I like you reading all those cardiology books.
Marge,"Oh Homie, I could never remarry..."
Marge,"Ohhh... kids, you can come in now."
Marge,My husband is still alive!
Marge,"Oh, that's wonderful!"
Marge,"Ohh, there's going to be a town meeting to decide how to spend Mr. Burns' money."
Marge,"Well, I think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of."
Marge,No.
Marge,"Oooh, it looks like everyone in Springfield showed up for this."
Marge,My name is Marge Simpson and I have an idea. It may sound a little boring at first...
Marge,Well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition Main Street is in.
Marge,Many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
Marge,And those potholes are becoming a real nuisance.
Marge,But Main Street's still all cracked and broken.
Marge,I still think we should have spent the money to fix Main Street.
Marge,"Homer, no..."
Marge,"Your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember?"
Marge,"According to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. What if something goes wrong?"
Marge,It frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
Marge,No.
Marge,"Goodnight, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, there's a family of opossums in here!"
Marge,I'm going to see Mr. Lanley.
Marge,Mr. Lanley? Mr. Lanley?
Marge,Nothing incriminating.
Marge,"Well, bye."
Marge,Who are you?
Marge,"Mr. Kobb, what can we do?"
Marge,Homer.
Marge,We're too late!
Marge,How fast are they going?
Marge,Homer? Homer?
Marge,"Homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you."
Marge,"No, he's a scientist."
Marge,It's not Batman!
Marge,And that was the only folly the people of Springfield ever embarked upon -- except for the Popsicle stick skyscraper... and the fifty foot magnifying glass... and that escalator to nowhere.
Marge,"Kids, I have some bad news. Your Great Aunt Gladys has... passed on."
Marge,"No honey, Gladys looked more like your Aunt Patty."
Marge,The funeral's in Little Neck Falls. Looks like we'll have to go to Duff Gardens another time.
Marge,"Oh Homer, quit pouting."
Marge,If you don't mind! We're on our way to a funeral.
Marge,"Homer, that's very rude of you."
Marge,"While we're waiting for our pie, let's take a minute to remember Great Aunt Gladys."
Marge,"Wait a minute. That was ""Prince of Tides."""
Marge,What are you kids playing?
Marge,That's nice.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Mr. Hutz!
Marge,Selma! Your date's over already?
Marge,"A hundred and one frozen pops. A Nobel Prize winner... an NBA All-Star... Ooh, one of the ""Sweathogs!"""
Marge,Oh. Are you sure you wanna have a baby this way?
Marge,Are you sure you've thought this through? A child can really change your life.
Marge,Have you been eating that sandwich again?
Marge,You've been eating that thing for a week. I think the mayonnaise is starting to turn.
Marge,"Homer, I found this behind the radiator. I really think you should throw it away."
Marge,Are you going to eat it?
Marge,You look terrible.
Marge,Your lips are turning blue. I think you'd better stay home.
Marge,... We really appreciate your taking the children on such short notice.
Marge,Do you feel any better?
Marge,"Well, to cheer you up I rented a couple of videos. ""Boxing's Greatest Weigh-Ins"" and ""Yentl""."
Marge,It deals with a bookish young woman's efforts to enter Rabbinical school.
Marge,"Oh my God, you're delirious."
Marge,"Hmmm, well, you've cooled down."
Marge,"You know, I rented another tape... in case you felt better."
Marge,With Norman Fell as Zeus!
Marge,I can't. The beans'll burn.
Marge,"Homer, we're going to my sisters'! Remember, pick up Bart!"
Marge,He called you a bad father.
Marge,"No, I just think you should talk to Bart about-- Good Lord!"
Marge,"Homer, do you have an explanation for this bill?"
Marge,"No, no. Someone made three hundred dollars worth of phone calls to something called ""The Corey hotline."""
Marge,Lisa.
Marge,"Why didn't you ask our permission, Lisa?"
Marge,"Aw honey, I know what you're going through. When I was a girl I had a crush on Bobby Sherman."
Marge,"The point is, I want you to stop making these calls."
Marge,"Lisa, the only way you'll lick this is one day at a time. If you can make it till midnight without calling the Corey line, you'll know you've beaten it forever."
Marge,I think we should go.
Marge,Lisa?
Marge,"Aw, Lisa. You tried your best."
Marge,And this is for my Huggy Bug in honor of this special day.
Marge,"Ah, thank you, dear."
Marge,"Well, honey, I--"
Marge,"Honey, honey, I'd tell this boy that you're very flattered, but you're just not ready for this kind of thing."
Marge,"Homer, I want you to encourage Lisa with her science fair project."
Marge,"Bart, don't give the dog cigarettes!"
Marge,"Homer, are you going to the Duff Brewery?"
Marge,"Well, I got an idea! Why don't you run a hamster through a maze?"
Marge,What's so funny?
Marge,Hello.
Marge,Oh my God. He's dead?
Marge,"Have a good day at work, honey."
Marge,"Homie, do you ever drink alone?"
Marge,No.
Marge,Do you need a beer to fall asleep?
Marge,Do you ever hide beer around the house?
Marge,Do you ever drink to escape from reality?
Marge,"Homie, I'd like you to do something for me."
Marge,I want you to give up beer for a month.
Marge,Did you say beer or deer?
Marge,"Please, Homie, I know you can do this."
Marge,What was that noise?
Marge,"Bart, could you go get the cupcakes?"
Marge,I don't know if I like you experimenting on your brother.
Marge,You've never looked better.
Marge,"I'm proud of you, Homie."
Marge,You don't have to start drinking right away. I was thinking we could go for a bike ride.
Marge,But you look better... you don't sweat while you eat anymore... and look.
Marge,You've saved more than a hundred dollars. I found it in your pants.
Marge,BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN MY EYES WILL SOON BE TURNING RED...
Marge,LA LA LA LA LA LA... LA...
Marge,Uh... not to my knowledge.
Marge,"Are you sure, Doctor?"
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"Homer, Lisa needs Braces."
Marge,Lisa needs braces.
Marge,Lisa needs braces.
Marge,Lisa needs braces.
Marge,Lisa needs braces.
Marge,Lisa needs braces.
Marge,Lisa needs braces.
Marge,Lisa needs braces.
Marge,Lisa needs braces.
Marge,"President of the union! I'm so proud of you, Homie."
Marge,"Doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now. So we'll need something a little more... affordable."
Marge,"Honey, you look fine."
Marge,Because they love you down at the plant.
Marge,That doesn't sound like they like you at all.
Marge,"Oh, honey, you can hardly see your new braces."
Marge,P.U.
Marge,Homie!
Marge,"Bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
Marge,Bart! Lisa! Stop that.
Marge,Arrrgh!
Marge,I have no idea. Unless it was that time he kept falling down the cliff.
Marge,You look familiar. Have we met before?
Marge,Bart!
Marge,It's true. You have good coping skills.
Marge,Why'd you bring that up?
Marge,"Society's loss, I suppose. But our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through."
Marge,Of course.
Marge,"Grampa, please. He's in a coma."
Marge,"Mr. Burns, how can you be so cold- hearted?"
Marge,"Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?"
Marge,Homie! You're all right!
Marge,Uh-huh.
Marge,You lost five percent of your brain.
Marge,"""Third Notice,"" ""Final Notice,"" ""Some Guys are Coming.""... Ooh, what's this?"
Marge,An invitation to our High School Reunion.
Marge,"Gee, that's odd. They didn't send one to you."
Marge,Oh my God.
Marge,"Well that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap. Wait, maybe it does."
Marge,And you're a nuclear technician?
Marge,What did you way?
Marge,Time to go to the reunion.
Marge,"That was ""Happy Days."""
Marge,"Hello, Principal Dondelinger."
Marge,I know.
Marge,"Oh my God, it's my old boyfriend, Artie Ziff."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Shhhh.
Marge,In a minute!
Marge,"That's wonderful, Homie!"
Marge,Now remember Bart. This is a religious school. So be very careful about what you say and do here.
Marge,You're going to get an education. I'm going to teach you myself.
Marge,Bart. Get dressed for school. I expect you to be in your seat when the bell rings.
Marge,I bought a bell.
Marge,I think I'll unplug that.
Marge,I'm your new teacher. My name is Mrs. Simpson.
Marge,"Oh, that's right. I invited a guest speaker to talk to the class."
Marge,Oooh!
Marge,Oooh! Oooooh! Oooooooh!
Marge,"Bart, I'd like you to read this copy of ""Johnny Tremain."" It's a book I read as a girl."
Marge,I think you might like this... It's about a boy who goes to war... his hand is deformed in an accident...
Marge,"Mm-hm, if you'd like to learn more about Colonial times we could take a field trip to Old Springfield Towne."
Marge,"Hello, Barney. Are you playing the town drunk?"
Marge,Slow... then fast.
Marge,Ninety-eight point six. You're fine.
Marge,"Now, hurry up or you'll miss your bus."
Marge,There is no such thing.
Marge,"Grampa, you know you can't have liquids after three p.m."
Marge,"And a bottle of aspirin, please."
Marge,$24.95!
Marge,"Uh... no, I-I guess I didn't."
Marge,Mr. Hutz --
Marge,Mr. Hutz! This was all a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to take anything.
Marge,Is that bad?
Marge,You did?
Marge,Will you excuse me while I go and freshen up?
Marge,Mr. Hutz!
Marge,Now you kids be good while mother's in prison.
Marge,"I'll be fine, dear."
Marge,I'll miss you too Homie.
Marge,"Knock, knock."
Marge,I'm Marge Simpson. Your new cellmate.
Marge,It's so nice not to have to cook.
Marge,Well... once.
Marge,"Homer, I don't think this fish is quite dead yet."
Marge,Oh my goodness.
Marge,What kind of slime would I marry? I don't understand.
Marge,Amazing!
Marge,"Oh honey, I've missed you too. Homer, is that an old Halloween costume?"
Marge,So how are things at home?
Marge,I hope you find somebody.
Marge,I didn't expect all this.
Marge,"Uh, it's beautiful."
Marge,"Your teenage son or daughter will think this wishbone necklace is really ""cool."""
Marge,No one bought a wishbone necklace.
Marge,Look what I got. Now people will stop intentionally ramming our car.
Marge,"Homer, you're going to be famous!"
Marge,Have you seen Bart?
Marge,With your father on the road all the time I tried to compensate for his absence...
Marge,"Lisa, you got a letter."
Marge,"You got a letter too, Bart."
Marge,Hmm. This one's done in different handwriting.
Marge,"Bart, I'm going to get you..."
Marge,"... some ice cream at the store, since I'm saving so much money on diet cola."
Marge,I'm pretty sure there is.
Marge,That man is so rude.
Marge,You awful man. Stay away from my son.
Marge,No!
Marge,I don't think this is such a good idea.
Marge,"Oh, what a cute convertible. You guys at the bureau thought of everything."
Marge,"Homer, where's the dog?"
Marge,We've left it all behind. How can you make a clean break with your life?
Marge,"Homer, this is serious."
Marge,"No, he hasn't."
Marge,It's so good to be home again.
Marge,"Bart, run upstairs and get Grampa's medicine!"
Marge,Would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow squares?
Marge,I think this is a great opportunity. You could learn so much.
Marge,"Homie, here are the responses from the colleges you applied to."
Marge,"You don't know, do you?"
Marge,"Homer, that isn't very nice."
Marge,"Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase."
Marge,"Homer, please. These boys sound very nice, but they're clearly nerds."
Marge,If you're going for a ride I'd like you to take Bart and Lisa.
Marge,"Oh, for the love of..."
Marge,What's wrong with this phone? It's making crazy noises.
Marge,No. I want those geeks out of my house.
Marge,"An ""A plus""! How did you do it?"
Marge,You changed your grade with a computer?
Marge,"And I learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you're gonna take that course over again without cheating."
Marge,What? Homie!
Marge,What's wrong?
Marge,What are you doin'?
Marge,I don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.
Marge,Come on dear. It's time to go.
Marge,"Homer! You've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss."
Marge,"Bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father."
Marge,"Hmm, better sew that eye back on."
Marge,I'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward. And then we'll make him double it.
Marge,Well why can't I be greedy once in awhile?
Marge,"More cocoa, Mr. Burns?"
Marge,Have you been up all night eating cheese?
Marge,I think we need a new hairdryer.
Marge,"I don't hate you, I'm proud of you. You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most."
Marge,Gimme that.
Marge,"It's an ending, that's enough."
Marge,"Bart! You should warn people this episode is very frightening and maybe they'd rather listen to that old War of the Worlds broadcast on NPR, Hmmm?"
Marge,"Good, now you hold Maggie. I'm going to buy some earrings at the gift shop."
Marge,Homer?! Did you eat that donut?
Marge,Homer! Are you all right?
Marge,"I'm sorry, Mr. Blackbeard, we're low on chairs and this is the last one."
Marge,Uh... Mr. Hutz?
Marge,"Wait! Before you send him to hell, there's something you should see."
Marge,That's a photo of Homer and me at our wedding.
Marge,Well... Homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself... before the wedding.
Marge,"Read the back, the back."
Marge,"Homer, stop picking at it."
Marge,"Lisa, your brother's obviously had a nightmare. Don't worry, honey, the scary part's over."
Marge,"Lisa, stop being so suspicious. Did everyone wash their necks like Mr. Burns asked?"
Marge,How'd you know he's a vampire?
Marge,"Homer, we gotta do something! Today he's drinking people's blood, tomorrow he could be smoking!"
Marge,This is dangerous. I wish we could have found a sitter for Maggie.
Marge,"No, I'm the head vampire!"
Marge,Homer?
Marge,"Well, I do have a life outside this house, you know."
Marge,Marge Simpson.
Marge,"I'd like to pledge thirty dollars. Oh, thank you!"
Marge,"They need our support. Besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet."
Marge,You like ballet?
Marge,"Hello, Ruth?"
Marge,That's one right there.
Marge,You promised. You can't back out like when you volunteered for that Army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters'.
Marge,Hello?
Marge,"Sure, Homer. Trapped in vending machines. Okay."
Marge,Would you two like to go to the ballet?
Marge,Hey wait!
Marge,"Well, thank you for a lovely time."
Marge,It's almost nine-thirty!
Marge,Thank you. Why?
Marge,Your point being?
Marge,"Well, you were unlucky, but there are a lot of good men out there."
Marge,"""Mrs. Simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down."""
Marge,"I'm disappointed in you, but it turns out I had a wonderful time with Ruth Powers. In fact, we're going out again tomorrow night."
Marge,"Homer, please. You know it's hard for me to make friends."
Marge,What's so special about it?
Marge,I don't know.
Marge,I'm not sure.
Marge,You already asked me that.
Marge,Don't wait up.
Marge,You look... nice.
Marge,"I am lucky. I have a husband and three wonderful children, thank you very much."
Marge,Oh... I've heard a lot about Shot Kickers.
Marge,"I said, no."
Marge,"Ooh, I've never been to an underground club."
Marge,Mayor Quimby! What are you doing here?
Marge,"Oh, that's nice."
Marge,What was it you wanted to show me?
Marge,"You're not going to hunt me for sport, are you?"
Marge,No. I couldn't.
Marge,I hit it! I hit it!
Marge,"Phht, it's only midnight. Come on, I know a place."
Marge,"Beautiful, huh? Homer and I used to come up here on dates."
Marge,"Homer, stop that! It's just a weather station."
Marge,Me too.
Marge,There's an awful lot of black smoke coming from my chimney.
Marge,Maybe we should call it a night.
Marge,I think they want us to stop.
Marge,Stolen?!
Marge,"Ruth, is there something you want to tell me?"
Marge,Mmm hmm.
Marge,Didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the police?
Marge,"I don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up."
Marge,"Oh, I don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose. I mean these are professional lawmen and..."
Marge,"Well, bye."
Marge,Yeah. Everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely.
Marge,"Ruth, I've done a lot of thinking, and I really consider you a friend. And an important part of friendship is..."
Marge,My God! That must be every policeman in Springfield!
Marge,"Ruth, that's a lot of hooey. It's not over until it's over."
Marge,"I'm sorry, I should have asked first."
Marge,Homer?!
Marge,You're right. I am lucky to have him.
Marge,Chasm?!
Marge,"Stop that, Bart. Homer, speak to him."
Marge,"Why do you read that ""Free"" column, Homer? They never have anything good."
Marge,Please don't bring home anymore old crutches!
Marge,I don't know if this is a good idea.
Marge,Are you sure it's safe?
Marge,"Homer, this is terrible!"
Marge,I told you this was a bad idea!
Marge,That's not true.
Marge,I can name ten things! I... I made sloppy Joes...
Marge,Kids. Tell me the truth. Am I no fun? Do I just nag all the time?
Marge,I didn't realize people saw me that way.
Marge,No. I'm fine. I'm going to my sisters' now.
Marge,I'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
Marge,Shhh!
Marge,"That video really opened my eyes. I can see that I'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. By nagging you when you do foolish things, I just enable your life-script."
Marge,"Exactly! So from now on, I'm going to quit nagging and have more fun."
Marge,"Homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies?"
Marge,I'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
Marge,"I'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance."
Marge,Good. I'm glad we had this talk.
Marge,Brad Goodman is coming to town!
Marge,Bart! Be quiet!
Marge,"Oh, thank you."
Marge,His name is Bart.
Marge,"Uh, I don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation, but my inner critic says you should've done your job!"
Marge,I knew it. If only I had nagged more...
Marge,That's not fair. The lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities.
Marge,"Homer, I have to go out to pick up something for dinner."
Marge,Money's too tight for steak.
Marge,"Sure, steak."
Marge,"I know you think the Junior Campers are square and... ""uncool,"" but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies."
Marge,"Homer, you should be more supportive."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Still no help.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,"Hi, Hober. Dote kiss be, I'b all stuffed up."
Marge,Oh that's sweet. Guess what. There's a new place at the mall - they'll put your picture on a T-shirt. I got two dollars off because mine got smeared.
Marge,"Good news, honey. Two weeks are up. You don't have to wear your glasses anymore. And your scalp and posture seem fine."
Marge,"This was a wonderful idea, Homie."
Marge,"Hey, there's a turkey behind the bed."
Marge,"Actually, I think it might really help our economy."
Marge,This could be a whole new beginning for Springfield.
Marge,"In honor of legalized gambling, why not go as the state of Nevada?"
Marge,"Then how 'about going as Florida? You enjoy orange juice, and old people like you."
Marge,Why?
Marge,"Your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on ""The Gong Show."" And you did it in 1977, remember?"
Marge,"Hi, Homie."
Marge,I was for the casino!
Marge,"Legalized gambling is a bad idea. You can build a casino over my dead body! Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
Marge,"I wonder if they have a lost and found. Oh, what the hey."
Marge,"Oh my God, Barney, thank you. I would never have forgiven myself."
Marge,"Now you stay put, young lady."
Marge,I'll catch up to you.
Marge,I'll walk.
Marge,Yeah.
Marge,Go home. You're bad luck!
Marge,What?!
Marge,No.
Marge,I won sixty dollars last night.
Marge,What happened here?
Marge,"Oh, I'm sorry. I have been spending too much time at the casino. I'll be around more from now on."
Marge,"Sure, honey. I promise."
Marge,Homer! What is it? Slow down.
Marge,Think before you say each word.
Marge,What?
Marge,"Lisa's costume. Homer, I didn't realize. I'm so sorry."
Marge,"You know, you're right, Homer. Maybe I should get some professional help."
Marge,That's true. Will you forgive me?
Marge,"Homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them like that."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,And my necklace.
Marge,Homer! That necklace was a priceless Bouvier family heirloom.
Marge,"Well... Yes, I do. But they're all heirlooms, too."
Marge,You have just been robbed by The Springfield Cat Burglar... Cute.
Marge,"Homer, tell your child what you bought when I sent you to town to get some insurance."
Marge,"Oh, stop blaming the beans."
Marge,And don't take candy from strangers.
Marge,"I don't think the guns are a good idea, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, wasn't the whole point to catch the cat burglar?"
Marge,Oh my! I had no idea how much this town loved that zirconia.
Marge,"Bart, I've asked you not to whistle that annoying tune."
Marge,Just a minute! Don't hang up!
Marge,What is it?
Marge,"Oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip. Think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker?"
Marge,"I don't know, Bart. You're only ten."
Marge,Well...
Marge,"Bart, it's time to get ready for the show."
Marge,"Honey, I know you feel a little silly saying the same four words over and over, but you shouldn't. You're making people happy. And that's a very hard thing to do."
Marge,The best performance of your life?
Marge,"I saved these for you, Bart. You'll always have them to remind you of the time when you were the whole world's special little guy."
Marge,"Yes, he's raking leaves."
Marge,"If he wants to make it up to you so badly, I think you should let him."
Marge,It certainly is exotic.
Marge,"Lisa, is that too spicy for you?"
Marge,"Apu, We usually store our cans in the cupboard."
Marge,"Hmm. Oh, we're low on milk for Maggie. You wanna come with me to the Kwik-E-Mart?"
Marge,"Well, I guess we could go to that new Monstromart..."
Marge,Ooh. That's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg.
Marge,But that's the longest.
Marge,"Apu, you've been so helpful. If it weren't for him, we'd still be in line at the Monstromart."
Marge,THEIR FLOORS ARE STICKY-MART.
Marge,I guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
Marge,How did it go?
Marge,"Oh, that'll work out great. We're out of Lucky Charms."
Marge,That sounds like a good movie.
Marge,That toy isn't safe for a baby like Maggie.
Marge,"I understand, honey. When I was your age there was a..."
Marge,Hm. I don't know if it's a good idea to do that while you're driving.
Marge,"Lisa -- ordinarily, I'd say you should stand up for what you believe in, but you have been doing that an awful lot lately."
Marge,"I had a Malibu Stacy when I was little, and I turned out all right. Now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream."
Marge,"Honey, you're not going to throw red paint at the executives, are you? The Keebler people were very upset..."
Marge,"I'm sorry, Homie."
Marge,"Well, we respect you."
Marge,"Bart, I told you, don't draw on your father's skull."
Marge,Pride?
Marge,"You know, Homer, when I found out about this I went through a wide range of emotions. First I was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. But now I realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do."
Marge,"Homer, when I met you, you weren't an astronaut. You didn't even know how to use a Touchtone. But I still respected you, and I always will, no matter what."
Marge,"Homer, you already dialed."
Marge,"But on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life."
Marge,"Oh, I am so proud of you. And I know it's going to go just fine..."
Marge,"Don't worry, kids, I'm sure your father's all right."
Marge,Who wants ginger snaps?
Marge,"Homie, you should be proud. Only a handful of people have done what you've done."
Marge,"Bart, do you have something nice to say to your father?"
Marge,"Those aren't tickets to the game, Homer."
Marge,"Oooh, the walls are melting again."
Marge,"Homer, that's not God, that's just a waffle that Bart tossed up there."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Are you planning to hit Ned Flanders with that pipe and take his tickets?
Marge,"Homer, that's our wedding photo."
Marge,"Honey, I'm so glad you're home--"
Marge,"Homey, I'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with Ned? Your family needs you too."
Marge,That was you!
Marge,There. I hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch.
Marge,"But, why would the Advisory Board give us bad advice?"
Marge,"That was a very nice thing you did, Homey."
Marge,Sandwich.
Marge,Underpants.
Marge,Bowling ball... more underpants...
Marge,No one's going anywhere. We're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom.
Marge,I think you'll find that escape is impossible. Now each one of you take a floor and get started.
Marge,Fine.
Marge,Oh Bart. Cleaning doesn't have to be a chore. Here... work to the music.
Marge,You're not done. I want you to throw away these old calendars and TV Guides.
Marge,Stop remembering TV and get back to work.
Marge,"Homer, what's going on down there?"
Marge,Then stop screaming so loud.
Marge,There! Isn't that a lot better? Now you can do whatever you want. But don't mess up the house.
Marge,Or double-ply windows! They look just like regular windows but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill...
Marge,"Well, they will."
Marge,"Homer, it looks like it could gore."
Marge,Bart!!!
Marge,I really think this is a bad idea.
Marge,"Ew, Homer, there is a bird on your head?"
Marge,Stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars.
Marge,Oh my Lord!
Marge,A female deer.
Marge,"Get a rope, Bart!"
Marge,Homie!
Marge,This is just what happened at the caramel factory.
Marge,"Gosh, I thought he'd be happier in his true habitat."
Marge,Then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
Marge,"Bart, this isn't the kind of thing I normally would think was a good idea, but you wouldn't have to live with Mr. Burns, you'd just get all of his money someday. This could provide for your entire future."
Marge,"Uh, sure."
Marge,"I've gotta stop fantasizing about Lee Majors. Ah, one more."
Marge,No it's not.
Marge,I think Bart and Lisa are feeling a little upset right now. Isn't there something you'd like to say?
Marge,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Marge,"No. You know, Bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him."
Marge,"C'mon, honey."
Marge,"Bart, don't throw peas at your sister."
Marge,"Homer, say something."
Marge,I'm very concerned. Mr. Burns has stolen our son and he won't give him back.
Marge,You know we should really stop hiring him.
Marge,Are you sure you can get him back for us?
Marge,What about Peter Fonda?
Marge,"Homer, that's Hans Moleman."
Marge,"Lisa, what are you doing?"
Marge,"That's sweet, honey."
Marge,The point is the real Simpson family missed you a lot and we're really glad you're home.
Marge,"Homer, I want that thing out of my house."
Marge,"I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the idea of your classmates laughing at our family's private moments. How would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were laughing at things you did?"
Marge,Why don't you bring this potato? It's pretty big.
Marge,I just think they're neat.
Marge,The dog has had enough excitement.
Marge,"Ned, Homer and I are a little concerned with the way the school's being run."
Marge,What's going on in there?
Marge,It says Freddy Quimby beat a waiter half to death. Those Quimby children are so wild and rich. I hope he finally gets what's coming to him.
Marge,"Well, Bart, your Uncle Arthur used to have a saying, ""Shoot 'em all and let God sort 'em out."" Unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice. It took seventy-five Federal marshals to bring him down. Now, let's never speak of him again."
Marge,Hmm?
Marge,"Honey, you should listen to your heart, and not the voices in your head, like a certain uncle did one grey December morn."
Marge,"Good for you, Homie. You know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone."
Marge,Give me those...
Marge,And those.
Marge,And those!
Marge,"Homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting Maggie's birthday cake."
Marge,"Hey, hey, hey hey, stop it! I made a special cake for you to ruin. It's over there."
Marge,Everybody get ready! Here comes the birthday girl in her very first dress!
Marge,Uh-oh.
Marge,"Maggie, we have a surprise for you."
Marge,"Homey, you know, it's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely."
Marge,"Yeah. Anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or shopping, or to that room in the library that's always full of old people. ""Periodicals,"" that's it."
Marge,"Homer, would you please stop reading that Ross Perot pamphlet?!"
Marge,"Say! I've got a neat idea. Why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner."
Marge,That's not my mother.
Marge,"You know, Mom, you and Abe have a lot in common. Umm, you both got swindled by that telemarketing scam."
Marge,"Well, I think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother."
Marge,"Bart! Homer, what possible reason could you have against Grampa being in love?"
Marge,"Hello, Mom? Fine. You know, Abe had a very nice time with you last Sunday..."
Marge,"Grampa, sssh! I know my mother. If you come on too strong, she's going to get scared away."
Marge,"Uh... I love ya, Mom!"
Marge,I love ya! I love ya! I love ya!
Marge,"I love ya! I love ya! I love ya! I love ya, Mom! Gotta go!"
Marge,Mom's almost ready for her date. She sure seems taken by this new beau. I feel so bad for Grampa.
Marge,"He's an awful, awful, awful man, but I guess if he makes Mom happy, that's all that really matters."
Marge,"Mom, you can't marry Mr. Burns! He's an evil man!"
Marge,What about Abe Simpson? Don't you have any feelings for him?
Marge,"We're all aware of Grampa's problems, but compared to Mr. Burns, he's Judge freaking Reinhold!"
Marge,Hm? Hm?
Marge,"We don't think you're slow. But, on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything."
Marge,"Oh Homie, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better."
Marge,"... There's that. Or, you could take an adult education course."
Marge,That's because you were drunk!
Marge,"Homer, that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer, not the other way around. You've ruined a perfectly good jacket."
Marge,Whatever do you mean? I don't dye my hair...
Marge,I don't know what you're talking about.
Marge,That's nice.
Marge,"Homer, I really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class."
Marge,Today at the Kwik-E-Mart everybody knew I dyed my hair.
Marge,"Mm-hmm. I'm happy about that. But, I think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy."
Marge,"Homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again."
Marge,"Homer, don't you have to get to class?"
Marge,"Oh, well that will be..."
Marge,What the darn...?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,I want this to end now!
Marge,All right. Okay. Everybody out!
Marge,Get out! Get out! Get out!
Marge,"You, too."
Marge,Get out!
Marge,"You just don't get it, do you, Homer? You told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. I can't trust you anymore."
Marge,"Kids, your father and I are going through a really tough time right now. And I don't know what's going to happen, but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much."
Marge,"But, isn't that a sin?"
Marge,Funny... the way everything reminds me of Homer.
Marge,"Oh my. I'm very flattered, but I'm not really interested."
Marge,Why don't you come inside for a drink of water?
Marge,"Here's your water, Moe."
Marge,"Homer, what happened to you?"
Marge,"Oh, here, let me help you."
Marge,"Homer, that's not a good thing."
Marge,"But, how do I know I can trust you?"
Marge,"I must admit, you really do make a gal feel needed."
Marge,"And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you later tonight."
Marge,"Homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. Although I must say, it's certainly refreshing."
Marge,Won't this overload the motor?
Marge,Is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before we go in?
Marge,Who could that be...?
Marge,Bart...? Are all these children friends of yours?
Marge,"Oh, look. There's Bart. Wave to him."
Marge,"Hmm, maybe we should spend more time with Bart. He's becoming isolated and weird."
Marge,"This was a lovely idea, Homie. Come here and kiss me."
Marge,I wish you'd stop spreading bad rumors about people. Remember how you got Grampa tarred and feathered?
Marge,"My, these seas are certainly heaving."
Marge,Does that earring mean you're a pirate?
Marge,"Lisa, stop blowing my sex! I mean, stop blowing your sax. Your sax. Stop it."
Marge,"I'm sorry, but I sacrificed a very expensive camera just to get some quiet time."
Marge,What! What?
Marge,"I don't know, honey. I guess that's the school's decision to make."
Marge,Lisa! I am nice.
Marge,"Homer, I really appreciate you making dinner, but this food tastes a little strange."
Marge,But the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound.
Marge,"Well, you'll always be number one to me..."
Marge,"Uh... I meant, my number one girl."
Marge,"Oh, for Chri..."
Marge,"Honey, if you get too competitive you'll never be happy. No matter how good you are there's always gonna be someone better than you. I always thought I had the tallest hair. But that trip to Graceland really opened my eyes."
Marge,"Believe me, honey. She's more scared of you than you are of her."
Marge,"While you were out ""earning"" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. The plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in Monday."
Marge,Homer?
Marge,"Homer, Homer!"
Marge,I want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar. You're being completely paranoid.
Marge,"Homer, when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme?"
Marge,"Look, just get rid of the sugar, okay?"
Marge,"I'm sorry, Homie."
Marge,"This romance is so full of heartfelt passion. I can really identify with this corn-fed heroine. Homer. Are you awake? This is important, give me some sign you're awake."
Marge,Wake up!
Marge,"Homie, do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives?"
Marge,Wake up!
Marge,It's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole Saturday drinking beer in Maggie's kiddy pool.
Marge,I can hit that one pin all right. But the rest of them don't even wobble.
Marge,"Homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. I want us to deal with the issues raised by this book."
Marge,I knew I shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
Marge,How many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
Marge,"Yes, they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about Ren and Stimpy? Children, your father and I have fed you and clothed you, but we've neglected something more important. It's time to learn about love."
Marge,I mean romance not love.
Marge,That's not true. Romance is all around us. In our neighborhoods...
Marge,Even on our jobs...
Marge,All you have to do is think about your most cherished memories.
Marge,"No, no, no. No, ask your heart what its fondest desire is."
Marge,"No, think about people. About moments in your life that have been very romantic."
Marge,"That's not the idea at all. Okay, well this story isn't ideal, I've never told it to you before."
Marge,I got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless.
Marge,"So I actually went to the bowling alley to spite him, or her..."
Marge,Oh!
Marge,I'm awfully sorry.
Marge,"Oh, no, no. Homer is my... ball's name. I'm Marge."
Marge,"No... no, thank you, Mr... uh... ... Brunswick."
Marge,Jacques.
Marge,Hmmm.
Marge,Sure.
Marge,Never.
Marge,No.
Marge,"Oh, I don't want to trouble you."
Marge,All right. But I'm not very good.
Marge,Oh!
Marge,But...
Marge,You're a very good teacher!
Marge,You didn't have to drop me off.
Marge,"Oh, Jacques, I'm a married woman."
Marge,What's brunch?
Marge,You didn't have to drop me off.
Marge,He seemed to know a lot about brunch. But it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all.
Marge,That doesn't shock me.
Marge,Is Thursday okay?
Marge,Thank goodness I drove down an ironic street.
Marge,"I made the right decision to stay with my Homie, and there was no harm done. So if you kind of mentally snip out the part where I already had a husband, that's my idea of romance."
Marge,"Okay, Homer."
Marge,"This was a wonderful idea, Homie."
Marge,"Yes, what did happen to her?"
Marge,Good. Does anyone else have a love story?
Marge,"Lisa, not all romances turn out that way. Bart, do you have a love story that doesn't end in heartbreak?"
Marge,"Well, as Jerry Lee Lewis would say: ""There's a whole lotta frowning going on."""
Marge,Of course. Remember when... Your Aunt Selma got married?
Marge,"Oh, wait, wait, that's no good. I know, your grandfather."
Marge,It all started on an outing for dinner...
Marge,"Say! I've got a neat idea. Why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner."
Marge,That's not my mother.
Marge,They hit it off right away. But there were rivals for the fair lady's hand...
Marge,"But in the end, just when things looked worse, true love triumphed."
Marge,I give up. Did anybody learn anything about love tonight?
Marge,"There's that side of it. But there's also... help me out here, Lisa."
Marge,"Well, kids, I tried. Maybe you're right."
Marge,"Gee, Artie. Artie wait. I don't know. I mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it."
Marge,"Artie, please!"
Marge,"No, oh, Artie!"
Marge,"Now, really, I mean it. Now stop it!"
Marge,"Take me home, Artie."
Marge,"Yeah, right."
Marge,Homer.
Marge,"Yeah, you want a ride?"
Marge,"You know Homer, when I got home, I realized who I should have gone to the prom with."
Marge,My prom date.
Marge,Why so glum?
Marge,"Mmmm, Homie..."
Marge,"See kids, that's what I meant by romance."
Marge,"No, I've already planned our vacation. We're going to the Highway 9 Bird Sanctuary. I understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year."
Marge,It's shaped like a diner. And it's on this really tall pole.
Marge,Hmm?
Marge,Oooh. Recipe-related bumper cars.
Marge,"Now wait a minute. I'm not sure about this. Every time we've ever gone on vacation, I end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. You have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time."
Marge,"Well, there was our trip to the Amish Country..."
Marge,Even worse was our trip to Sandy Beach.
Marge,This year I want us to do things together as a family and get a lot of good exercise outdoors so we'll have a lot of wonderful memories of our vacation.
Marge,"...and remember, every morning give one bowl of kibble to Santa's Little Helper. Do you want me to write any of this down?"
Marge,"What's the matter with you, Homer? We don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car."
Marge,We'd better find a motel and stop for the night.
Marge,"Homer, no. You're going to get lost."
Marge,Such a violent motif.
Marge,"Oh, please. It was just a figure of speech."
Marge,"When do you show the consequences? On TV, that mouse pulled out that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe. But in the next scene, the cat was breathing comfortably."
Marge,Bart!
Marge,Homer! We just got here and already I'm mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior.
Marge,"Oh, I see. All right. I'll have the baby guts."
Marge,Oh.
Marge,You're sure she'll have fun here?
Marge,"Tortureland, Explosion Land, Searing Gas Pain Land, Unnecessary Surgery Land..."
Marge,"It's cute, but I'm sure it's very sharp, and probably dirty."
Marge,"See all that stuff in there, Homer? That's why your robot never worked."
Marge,This is just what I was hoping for. Spending the day together as a family.
Marge,"Ah, you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals."
Marge,Yuh-huh. I'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner. Are you kids gonna be alright?
Marge,Kids?
Marge,"Hey, the bartender even looks like John Travolta."
Marge,It must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over and over.
Marge,"I want all five T-shirts to say, ""Best vacation ever."""
Marge,I'm so embarrassed. I wish there was a hole I could just crawl into and die.
Marge,"Stay away from me, Homer!"
Marge,I have nothing to say to you.
Marge,How were you a political prisoner?
Marge,"Oh for gosh sakes, what now?"
Marge,I knew we should have gone to the bird sanctuary.
Marge,"Oh my, it looks like we're doomed!"
Marge,I don't approve of that.
Marge,"Are you two bonkers? We almost got killed, not to mention all the embarrassment I suffered."
Marge,"You know, you're right. This truly was the best vacation ever. Now, let us never speak of it again."
Marge,"I hope you realize now that violence on TV may be funny, but it's not so funny when that violence is happening to you."
Marge,"Oh my. Lisa, go to your room."
Marge,"This sounds awfully controversial. Lisa, you know I don't like controversy in this house."
Marge,"Bart, I wish you wouldn't lie like that."
Marge,"Homer, we've got to stop them."
Marge,"Homer, did you remember to lock the front door of the house?"
Marge,"When you locked the front door, did you remember to lock the back door?"
Marge,"Homer, I'm impressed. You're taking this quite well."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,We're just gonna have to wait and see.
Marge,Homer! Homie? Hm... what he's typed will be a window into his madness.
Marge,"Feelin' fine, well, that's a relief."
Marge,This is less encouraging.
Marge,Go crazy?
Marge,"You stay here 'til you're no longer insane. Mmmm, chili would be good tonight."
Marge,"Hello, police? This is Marge Simpson. My husband is on a murderous rampage. Over."
Marge,No answer.
Marge,"Oh my, I hope that rug was Scotchguarded."
Marge,Dad!! Daaadd!! Homer!!
Marge,It's Bliiiiisssss.
Marge,Donut? What's a donut?
Marge,Hmph. It's raining again.
Marge,"Good morning, dear."
Marge,Homer! The sky is blue. Donuts are plentiful. Friday is TGIF night on ABC. What's gotten into you?
Marge,"Listen, kids. You're eight and ten years old now. I can't be fighting all your battles for you."
Marge,"No buts. You march right back to that school, look them straight in the eye and say ""don't eat me."""
Marge,"Relax, honey. You were just having a crazy nightmare. You're back with your family now, where there's nothing to be afraid of -- except that fog that turns people inside out."
Marge,Bart! Lisa! Time for church.
Marge,"You just answered your own question with that commode mouth. Besides, you kids need to learn morals and decency, and how to love your fellow man."
Marge,"I don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair. Awful, awful hair."
Marge,"Oh that's sweet, Homer. Our son is growing up, isn't he?"
Marge,Have you noticed any change in Bart?
Marge,No. He looks like something might be disturbing him.
Marge,I guess we could get more involved in Bart's activities. But then I'd be afraid of smothering him.
Marge,That's not what I meant.
Marge,"Time for church, Bart. I bet your little friend Jessica will be there."
Marge,Thirty cents off Shake 'n Bake. Homer!
Marge,"Homer, stop that. I believe him."
Marge,That's what he wore to church.
Marge,"Bart honey, do you know who did take the money?"
Marge,We really shouldn't have let them do this. It can't be helping his self esteem.
Marge,"Uh, I think you all owe my son an apology."
Marge,"Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about this warning. I really hope you try harder."
Marge,Cheer up. So you're not good at sports. It's a very small part of life.
Marge,"I think Lisa needs to feel a little special tonight. How about letting her ride up front, too?"
Marge,"Well, I think women should be able to play any sport men play, but hockey is so violent and dangerous. Look at Milhouse's teeth."
Marge,No.
Marge,I can't even watch. I don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor Lisa while she's out there probably scared to death.
Marge,"Absolutely, honey. By blocking the net I really think you helped your team."
Marge,"Bart, I can spend some time with you."
Marge,"Don't have a stereotypical view of me just because I'm your mother. I know. How about we play the basketball? I'm no Harvey Globetrotter, but..."
Marge,"Hey, watch out for the Shaq-attack!"
Marge,I told you to watch out.
Marge,"Lemme give my special little winner a big, big hug."
Marge,"Hm, I better go check that out. Now Homer, don't you eat this pie."
Marge,Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Marge,I don't care who started it. I don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. We love you both. You're not in competition with each other. Repeat. You are not in competition with each other.
Marge,I won't have any aggressive condiment passing in this house.
Marge,"You caught me at a real bad time, Moe. I hope you understand I'm too tense to pretend I like you."
Marge,"Moe, I think you should leave."
Marge,No.
Marge,No.
Marge,"Homer, we can't root for one child over the other. You wouldn't like it if the kids played favorites with us."
Marge,He tripped my boy. I demand vengeance! I want vengeance!
Marge,I've never been so proud of them.
Marge,"Oh, well thank you Homer. But take one of the kids."
Marge,"Homer, are all these pockets necessary?"
Marge,"Well, that's the babysitter. No one in town will sit for you two anymore. I had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scary-looking hobo."
Marge,Well there's also a baby somewhere upstairs!
Marge,"Will you two stop saying ""gummy"" so much."
Marge,No. I won't make a spectacle out of myself any further.
Marge,Oooh... how'd they get there?
Marge,I'm sure it'll turn up. Take the baby-sitter home now. She's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
Marge,"Well why don't we give it to some needy children, then?"
Marge,"At any rate, I believe you and I think you should go outside and straighten this out. Some of their chants are very catchy and memorable."
Marge,They seem to be building some sort of a shantytown.
Marge,Homer! Wake up! Wake up!
Marge,Homer--
Marge,"I already talked to the Indignation Coordinator out on the lawn today. I told her you were a decent man. But she wouldn't listen. Besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more I can do."
Marge,"Homer, that's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. It's not gonna happen."
Marge,"Look, maybe this whole thing will blow over."
Marge,"Yes, yes, yes. That's fine. Good, good."
Marge,Oh really?
Marge,I hope you kept the Homie fires burning...
Marge,Homer.
Marge,Homer! Homie! The kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name!
Marge,"Well, we can dress it up a bit. We can bring a fern... and a folding chair from the garage... And the most decorative thing of all: the truth."
Marge,There are only forty-nine stars on that flag.
Marge,"You know, the courts might not work anymore, but as long as everybody is videotaping everyone else, justice will be done."
Marge,"Groundskeeper Willie saved you, Homer."
Marge,Hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?
Marge,"Is there something wrong, Homie?"
Marge,Don't turn on the light! Don't turn on the light!
Marge,"Oh, Bart. It's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree."
Marge,No!
Marge,We need to talk about the... marital difficulties we've been having lately.
Marge,I simply can't wait that long. Maybe we should get some help... How 'bout a book?
Marge,A tasteful book.
Marge,Shh. I don't want people to see us looking at these books.
Marge,"Oh, I'm just reading up on, artillery."
Marge,"This one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey, you know, that nice Midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa."
Marge,Sane Planning: Sensible Tomorrow.
Marge,"HomeIE, I can't quite..."
Marge,So am I.
Marge,Kids? Kids?
Marge,The Arabian Nights Room looks nice...
Marge,This isn't very erotic. I think it's an actual utility room.
Marge,"Oh, Homey, what's--"
Marge,"Here he is, Rex Harrison and Paul Anka rolled into one! That tonic really works! You and Grampa should bottle it and go into business together."
Marge,You could make a lot of money.
Marge,You threw them out the window in a fit of passion. You said you were never going to need them again.
Marge,"Homie, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of your life?"
Marge,You didn't want to have Bart.
Marge,You tell Bart all the time. You told him this morning.
Marge,What if you pretended that this couch were a bar? Then you could spend more nights at home with us. Huh?
Marge,I just left my first session and I haven't even opened my mouth yet.
Marge,"I don't know, Homer. We're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season."
Marge,"I don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden."
Marge,"Oh, I forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer. If someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a fire."
Marge,I think I'll go get a picture of the plane taking off.
Marge,"Homer, I've never told you this before, but I'm not a good flyer. I have to get off the plane. Let me off the plane. I'm asking you nicely to open the doors."
Marge,Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off!
Marge,"Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it."
Marge,"Well, everybody's got a fear of something."
Marge,Sock puppets.
Marge,Sure as sugar.
Marge,I just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog. They've been living in sin.
Marge,"Judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one, you are."
Marge,"No, no honey, it's all right. Really. I'm fine. I'm all right. Mother always said ""don't complain. Be good. Behave, behave. Be nice, smile be polite, don't make waves."""
Marge,In a little while.
Marge,Can't talk. Keeping myself in a state of cat-like readiness.
Marge,"Mm, no, I don't need therapy, I'm fine. And it's too expensive."
Marge,But I...
Marge,Thirty dollars will be fine.
Marge,"I'm sorry, doctor. He's just afraid you'll blame all my problems on him."
Marge,But it's a few seconds before 12:00.
Marge,Hmm. That would have to be my first day of school.
Marge,The kids at school were even worse.
Marge,They do so!
Marge,No! No!
Marge,But it's true. They didn't write their own songs or play their own instruments.
Marge,I don't think so.
Marge,"I keep having the same dream. I'm the mother from ""Lost In Space."""
Marge,"Ready for breakfast, Doctor Smith?"
Marge,Wait! Daddy! Wait! Please don't leave. Take me with you!
Marge,"No, I didn't."
Marge,"Sure, okay. I'll talk about father. Father Christmas. That's what they call Santa Claus in England. They drive on the wrong side of the road there. Now that's crazy. People are always saying how small England is. But you couldn't fit it all in here. Not by a long shot. You know what? I'm cured."
Marge,Okay. Okay... But you're gonna make a big deal outta this. He was a pilot.
Marge,You see.
Marge,Wait. I'm remembering something...
Marge,I was a little girl...
Marge,Why does Daddy have to leave?
Marge,I want to see Daddy fly!
Marge,"Daddy?! Daddy, where are you, Da..."
Marge,Daddy?
Marge,My father was a stewardess.
Marge,They are?
Marge,Yeah... You might even say he was an American hero.
Marge,"Wait, some other stuff's coming back to me."
Marge,You think those could also have contributed to my fear of flying?
Marge,"Oh well, Thank you, Doctor, you've changed my life!"
Marge,"Thank you, Doctor. Whenever the wind whistles through the leaves I'll think Lowenstein, Lowenstein."
Marge,Lowenstein.
Marge,Could you start fixing it pretty soon? The basement is getting awfully flooded. And I think the cat's down there.
Marge,Oh dear.
Marge,"Oh, Homer. Don't start stalking people again. It's so illegal. Remember when you were stalking Charles Kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden?"
Marge,I don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
Marge,Everyone likes you. You're a wonderful person.
Marge,"I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer."
Marge,Kids can be so cruel.
Marge,"I know, I know."
Marge,"Homer, a man who called himself ""You Know Who"" just invited you to a secret ""wink wink"" at the ""you know what."" You certainly are popular now that you're a Stonecutter."
Marge,"You're not a god, Homer."
Marge,"Aw, Homie. You know, you are a member of a very exclusive club."
Marge,"Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these Colobus monkeys. Somebody's gonna get parasites."
Marge,"No. The family Simpson, which has just five members. And only two of those members have special rings."
Marge,I meant our wedding rings.
Marge,"All right, all right. It's Lisa's turn."
Marge,"Okay, TV off. It's family time."
Marge,"Homer, you promised. One night of family time a week. Besides, that back-talking boat sets a bad example."
Marge,"All right, family time begins now."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Yeah, yeah, yeah two. Let's get to the baby pictures."
Marge,"Here's Bart sleeping... Here he is dozing... Here he is after a visit from the sandman... Ooh, here's nappy-time Bart... Here's a cute one, he's all tuckered out..."
Marge,Homer! Tell the story right.
Marge,I don't know if it's such a good idea. Can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?
Marge,Homer...
Marge,Me too. Let's go home.
Marge,"I love you too, Homie."
Marge,Did you have to be so graphic?
Marge,"Oh no, no. N-not exactly. It's just that I haven't told Homer yet; and with his new job, I don't know how we're going to be able to afford this."
Marge,What?
Marge,So in a few months both of you will have a brand new brother or sister.
Marge,Why do you say that?
Marge,"Hey, I'm just hangin'."
Marge,"Homie, I--"
Marge,"I've got to tell Homer about this baby in just the right way and at just the right time. Until then please, keep this to yourselves."
Marge,Oh yes.
Marge,"Wait a minute, wait, I know that look. Now promise you won't tell Homer."
Marge,"Baby shower?! You know I haven't told Homer yet, and he'll be home any minute."
Marge,"Actually, when I was about to have Bart..."
Marge,And then when I told him about Lisa...
Marge,"I'll stay here, but I'm gonna think about products I might like to purchase."
Marge,"Ooh, I don't have that."
Marge,Homer! Let your father tell the story.
Marge,"Homer, you had a head."
Marge,And your bottom was a little bigger.
Marge,You've worked hard at the bowling alley. Why don't you ask for a raise?
Marge,That's what really happened.
Marge,"Well, actually -"
Marge,My contractions started an hour ago.
Marge,"Homie, I think someone is saying hello."
Marge,There's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last night. Just rinse it good...
Marge,"What did you do today, Bart?"
Marge,Boy Discovers Comet.
Marge,"""A young Springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known as 'The Bart Simpson Comet.'"" Oh honey, I'm so proud of you."
Marge,Yes.
Marge,"Homer, what if this doesn't work?"
Marge,Turn it off.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Get in the shelter, Homer."
Marge,One more hour.
Marge,"Stop it, stop it. Can't you see this barnyard noise guessing game is tearing us apart?!"
Marge,"Say Moe, was it a duck?"
Marge,Look!
Marge,I think I'll have some wine.
Marge,"Yes, Homie?"
Marge,"Hold still, Homer. Don't squirm."
Marge,I'm not saying it won't work. I'm just saying it's dishonest.
Marge,"Oh, for Pete's sake, Bart! Use the plunger!"
Marge,Oh my.
Marge,"Bart, did you trick an Australian boy into accepting a nine hundred dollar collect call?"
Marge,Undersecretary for International Protocol. Brat and Punk Division.
Marge,"No, no, no, no! I'm not gonna have my son go to jail over some silly tiff with Australia! You'll just have to find some other country to have relations with."
Marge,Bart!
Marge,That's better.
Marge,"Homer, that's enough."
Marge,"""Australia was originally founded as a settlement for British convicts."" Lisa, watch your camera."
Marge,I'll just have a cup of coffee.
Marge,No. I said coffee.
Marge,Coff - ee!
Marge,C... O...
Marge,We'll meet you boys back here for dinner. Good luck honey.
Marge,That seems very noisy and expensive for a souvenir. Why don't you get this nice cap?
Marge,"It's clever, just like you. Huh? Huh?"
Marge,We have them in America. They're called bullfrogs.
Marge,"I can't believe our government would set up Bart like that. I must say, I'm very angry at the State Department right now."
Marge,"Oh, for the love of criminy! Gimme that! I know Bart did something wrong, but he's my son and I'm going to punish him myself."
Marge,"Our countries may have their differences, but as human beings I think we can all agree there's no substitute for the discipline of a loving parent."
Marge,He wants to talk to you.
Marge,"No deal! This is my son we're talking about. Sure he's not perfect, but who is in this work-a-day world?"
Marge,"I'm glad you're okay honey, but I wish you'd chosen a more tasteful way to be patriotic."
Marge,This is a special occasion. Patty and Selma just got promoted at the DMV.
Marge,"I'm sorry. Homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man."
Marge,"I wish you wouldn't put Homer down like that. He may not be a big success like you, but I can always count on him to provide for the family."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Homer, wake up. There's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime."
Marge,"Money problems? Homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?"
Marge,"Bart, I told you before, stop gnawing on the drywall."
Marge,"Patty, Selma. What are you doing here?"
Marge,"Homer, be careful with my sisters' heads. Their necks are brittle."
Marge,What's that supposed to mean?
Marge,"This has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. I'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, Montreal Morn."
Marge,"I'm sorry. All we have is Nescafe. I'm very, very sorry."
Marge,You are?
Marge,What's going on in here?
Marge,What's that paper?
Marge,"Homer, is this projection accurate? Did you borrow money from my sisters?"
Marge,"Homer, Homer why didn't you tell me?"
Marge,"Not too good, Lisa. Frankly, he's underneath the table."
Marge,But I like to make you breakfast.
Marge,"""Tested,"" Homer, God tested Moses. And try to be nice to my sisters. It's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time."
Marge,"So Homer, how'd you do?"
Marge,That's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
Marge,"No, Homie. You see. You see, this is the stuff I've been telling you about that you never see."
Marge,"No, Homer."
Marge,"I think we should call a town meeting. If we don't do something soon, we won't get any tourists at all."
Marge,"I'm Marge Simpson, and I have an idea."
Marge,Now I know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions. Like switching to the metric system...
Marge,But my new idea is different. I think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes.
Marge,Yes!
Marge,"You like my idea? Actually, I have several others..."
Marge,I'm looking for a film critic to help judge our festival. Did you know there are over six hundred critics on TV and Leonard Maltin is the best looking of them all?
Marge,"""Dear Mr. Sherman. On behalf of the people of Springfield, I would like to invite you to judge our film festival."""
Marge,"""You can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country."""
Marge,"Just a minute, Homer! Oh, look what you made me write! Anyway, we think you'll really enjoy our quiet little town. Sincerely, Marge Simpson."""
Marge,"It's supposed to say Jay's name, not yours."
Marge,"Hello, I'm Marge Simpson and this is my husband, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, the guest should get the last pork chop."
Marge,"Oh, I invited my sisters over."
Marge,How droll.
Marge,Making out the jury list for the film festival. Mayor Quimby -- Krusty -- Jay --
Marge,Yes.
Marge,No reason.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,You don't have to do this.
Marge,I don't think you're stupid.
Marge,Fine. You're on the jury.
Marge,"Homer, please pay attention. There's just one more movie."
Marge,All right. It's time to vote for the grand prize.
Marge,Second.
Marge,Why don't we all take a five minute break? It'll clear our heads.
Marge,I knew this would happen. I put you on the jury and you vote for the stupidest film.
Marge,"Well, Homer."
Marge,"Homie, you voted for the right movie. I'm glad you were on the jury."
Marge,"Well, Jay, I hope you tell your New York friends that people in small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think."
Marge,"Well, it was a lovely festival. The best movie won and Mr. Burns found there are some awards that can't be bought."
Marge,Oh really? Did you see the loom? I took Loom in High School.
Marge,"Lisa!! Hello! How're you doing in England? Remember, an elevator is called a ""lift,"" a mile is called a ""kilometer,"" and botulism is called ""steak and kidney pie."""
Marge,"ALL RIGHT!!! Lisa, that's wonderful. If only your father was still with us... but he left for work a few minutes ago."
Marge,"Oh, don't worry, honey. I guarantee your father will behave."
Marge,"This? This? No, I - I've just got a touch of the rheumatiz."
Marge,"Homer, don't take this personally, but I've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding."
Marge,Oh Lisa!
Marge,Now throw compost on it!
Marge,Homer! Bart! Maggie! Company eating rules.
Marge,Maggie! Don't talk with your mouth full.
Marge,"You know, Fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually, I didn't even notice."
Marge,"Lisa, I can't believe it's your wedding day already."
Marge,"Oh, Milhouse doesn't count."
Marge,Here.
Marge,"All right, who broke my vase?!"
Marge,"Well, I'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?"
Marge,I think there's really something wrong with Santa's Little Helper. He was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever.
Marge,"Yes, the dog..."
Marge,"Excuse me, we're having a problem with our dog..."
Marge,"No, no, our dog is out of control. He's wild, destructive, and has little or no respect for authority."
Marge,"Homer, hold on to the wheel!"
Marge,"Oh, this place is so big. Do you think we should split up and look for them, Homie? Homie?"
Marge,"""She's The Fastest..."" Homer, I don't think that means necessarily..."
Marge,Uh-oh...
Marge,I think they're in love.
Marge,But she's not our dog.
Marge,But won't you miss her loyalty and companionship?
Marge,"Okay, you can go out and play, but... no more you know what in front of the house, all right?"
Marge,"Hey, what did I just say?!!"
Marge,Bart! Don't ever say that word again!
Marge,"Well, I'm going to write the dictionary people and have that checked. It feels like a mistake to me."
Marge,"Oh, my God! She's having babies! Oh, I'm sorry, girl. I thought you were just getting fat."
Marge,"Homer, Homer find a place for all these little miracles."
Marge,"Oh, my. I've never seen anything like this."
Marge,"Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable?"
Marge,"Look at Branford II! Isn't that cute? He thinks he's one of the Models, Inc."
Marge,"Well, it's just easier this way."
Marge,"Yeeesch! This house stinks! You're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?"
Marge,"Now I know we love the puppies very much, but I think they're getting to be a problem."
Marge,"All right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. As long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. On a completely unrelated topic, I'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight."
Marge,"Rev. Lovejoy, your old Army drill sergeant, and the Regional Director of the IRS."
Marge,"We've got to be realistic, kids. Who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of twenty-five puppies?"
Marge,"She's right, Homer. There's something about his face I don't trust."
Marge,"My, he certainly took that well."
Marge,"Dogs! Chief, you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor!"
Marge,"Dinner's on, dogs!"
Marge,"Homer! For the love of God, no."
Marge,Bart! Lisa! What are you two doing home so early?
Marge,"Bart, leave that crowbar here. You know I don't like you prying and jimmying."
Marge,"Honey, maybe you should relax a little?"
Marge,"I'm worried about the kids, Homie. Lisa's becoming very obsessive. This morning I caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat."
Marge,"And Bart isn't doing very well either. He needs boundaries, and structure. There's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome."
Marge,That's it. We have to get them back to school.
Marge,"Hello class. Hi Bart. Over here, sweetie. It's me, Mom. Hi. Hey. Hello."
Marge,"Well, I'm sure some of you already know me. I'm Bart Simpson's mother."
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,Ohh...kids have been doing that one since my day.
Marge,Exhausting. It took the children forty minutes to locate Canada on the map.
Marge,I'd be thrilled. You can start right now.
Marge,And I'm gonna keep teaching your class. Like it or lump it.
Marge,I hate it when he gets in there.
Marge,"Ah, here you go, precious. Now go off with your friends."
Marge,"That's a very nice jig, Kearney. Now, isn't dancing much more fun than bullying?"
Marge,"Bart, are you ready for your history test?"
Marge,OK. Who was George Washington Carver?
Marge,"Bart, you said you were going to study."
Marge,You just don't want to take that test.
Marge,"Homer, this is an operation!"
Marge,How's my special little guy?
Marge,Marge!
Marge,"Lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and Bleeding Gums was a good friend to you. But nobody is really gone as long as we remember them."
Marge,"Homer, this is a cemetery."
Marge,"What do you do, follow my husband around?"
Marge,"Hm, maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him."
Marge,That's Mary Had a Little Lamb.
Marge,That's the same thing! You just replaced dees with doos!
Marge,Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
Marge,"Ah, c'mon, Homer, there's lasers. You like lasers."
Marge,"Homie, these games are fixed."
Marge,He looks and acts just like the dealer. I think they're related or at least in cahoots.
Marge,"Homer, he cheated you."
Marge,"It's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas. How dare you prey on the greedy and stupid, like this."
Marge,Somebody stop him!
Marge,He's getting away!! C'mon! C'mon!
Marge,"Uh, I must warn you, um, uh, sometimes ordinary people g-g-get a surge of uh- adrenaline. Wee-aah!"
Marge,See?...
Marge,"Ah, I think I'm okay. It was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating."
Marge,Oh for crying out loud...
Marge,"Lisa, unhand your brother."
Marge,"Well, it was pretty exciting, but celery soup's pretty exciting too."
Marge,"Strange, regular ham doesn't thrill me anymore. I'm crossing over to deviled ham. Whoa!"
Marge,Thanks Benevenstanciano.
Marge,Death sports.
Marge,Excuse me...
Marge,"Actually, I'm interested in becoming a police officer."
Marge,"You got it, little buddy."
Marge,"Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. You'll always be the man of this house."
Marge,"Hey everybody, Mom's home."
Marge,"They didn't have my size shirt, but you get the idea."
Marge,"Oh, Homie, of course I will."
Marge,I suppose I would.
Marge,No.
Marge,No.
Marge,"Well, thank you, honey."
Marge,"Homer, give me my pepper spray."
Marge,"Hello, Mr. Hutz."
Marge,I just wanted to say hello.
Marge,"Two hundred. No! No! I mean, I mean nothing. I don't take bribes."
Marge,"Apu, no."
Marge,That's better.
Marge,I got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address.
Marge,Um-hmmm. Who called the police?
Marge,"Look, why don't you two settle down. I'm sure you can get another pillow."
Marge,I just want to relax and forget that I'm part of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos .
Marge,"Bart, it's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet."
Marge,It's for your own safety.
Marge,"Don't stop talking on account of me. I may be a cop, but I'm still your friend."
Marge,"So, how are you, Mrs. Krabappel?"
Marge,"Moe, I've never seen you here before."
Marge,"You don't have to call me ""Officer."" I'm not on duty here."
Marge,Whoa!
Marge,"Oh. Uh, a looks nice. It's a, it's a good length for you."
Marge,"And that's the drunk tank, and this is mommy's desk."
Marge,"Look, Lisa. It's McGriff the Crime Dog."
Marge,"Hello, Lisa. Help me bite crime. Ruff, ruff."
Marge,Illegal gambling in my house?!
Marge,I didn't mean to.
Marge,"I'm still all those things. Only now I'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system."
Marge,"Everywhere I look, someone is breaking the law. Dog, no leash. Man littering. Horse not wearing diaper. Car parked across three handicapped spaces..."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Homer, I'm on duty."
Marge,You have to move your car.
Marge,"I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that, but you have to move your car now."
Marge,"Oh, that's it. I'm gonna write you a ticket."
Marge,You're breaking the law.
Marge,"Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense."
Marge,You have the right to remain silent...
Marge,"I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer. But what I did was right. Someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there."
Marge,I don't think that's a very good idea.
Marge,"No, it's Officer Simpson - of the police!"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Go back to bed! Don't make me come up there!
Marge,Freeze!
Marge,Freeze! Every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.
Marge,I don't think so.
Marge,That the pants would rip?...
Marge,"Years of buying pants for two active children and a full-seated husband has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching, which these jeans have in spades."
Marge,That's it! There's too much corruption on this force. I quit!
Marge,"Bart, you've graffito-tagged public property."
Marge,"I can't believe you vandalized your own home town, Bart. What would Jebediah Springfield say?"
Marge,"Oh, Homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?"
Marge,"Well, I am just shocked by this whole family. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride?"
Marge,Now just a darned minute! This town is a part of who you are.
Marge,"This is a Springfield Isotopes cap. When you wear it, you're wearing Springfield. When you eat a fish from our river, you're eating Springfield. When you make lemonade from our trees you're drinking Springfield."
Marge,"Bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it. This town is a part of us all, a part of us all, a part of us all. Sorry to repeat myself but it'll help you remember."
Marge,This town is a part of us all... a part of us all... a part of us all...
Marge,"Where you going, Bart?"
Marge,I choose to take that literally.
Marge,It's almost lunch time. Do you know where your brother is tutoring?
Marge,"Well, do you have a number where we can reach him?"
Marge,"Homer, come quick! Bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence-gang!"
Marge,"This is my fault. I tried to teach Bart about town pride, but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness."
Marge,Isn't there anything we can do?
Marge,I'm happy for the school. It sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities.
Marge,I have an idea.
Marge,"When my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it. After that, she never forgot him."
Marge,Holy Christmas.
Marge,"I must say Mr. Burns is being awfully inconsiderate. Selfish, even."
Marge,Strained carrots for Maggie... Strained carrots for Grampa.
Marge,"Bart! Put that down! Guns are very dangerous, and I won't have them in this house."
Marge,I'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to it.
Marge,He's causing us all to yell!
Marge,That's odd. Where's Homer? And Bart? And Lisa? And Grampa?
Marge,Where is everybody?
Marge,I don't think we'll ever know who did this. Everyone in town's a suspect.
Marge,The police already have a suspect. It's Mr. Smithers.
Marge,I guess it's never the most likely suspect.
Marge,I think you're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder. Why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer?
Marge,"Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there. Have you seen it?"
Marge,I was just asking if you'd seen it. There's no need to be a prickly pear.
Marge,"Were you talking to me, Grampa?"
Marge,"The police have such a strong case against Homer. Mr. Burns said he did it, they have Homer's D.N.A..."
Marge,"No. No, no. When I took your father's name, I took everything that came with it, including D.N.A."
Marge,No. We can't start thinking that way about our own family members. Suspicion could tear us apart.
Marge,"Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you've recovered and we can all get back to normal. If Maggie could talk I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you."
Marge,"Besides, she didn't mean it. It was an accident."
Marge,"Bart, why are you talking like that?"
Marge,"Growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good, Bart."
Marge,"Here's your toast, Maggie. I Melba-fied it myself."
Marge,"Oh, Lisa, honey, I tracked down those old newspapers for your history project."
Marge,"Oh, it was no trouble. The hobos at the dump were very helpful. Except one man who seemed to have mental problems."
Marge,"Bart, it's class photo day. No dracula fangs."
Marge,No they didn't.
Marge,And don't put signs on your sister.
Marge,"Now, keep the lettuce separate until 11:30. That way, the lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry! Eh? Eh?"
Marge,"Enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself."
Marge,You did the right thing by telling me.
Marge,Shoo! Get outta here!
Marge,"""Good for a three hour getaway at the Mingled Waters Health Spa."" Mineral bath, facial, massage... How did you afford these?"
Marge,"Homie, this is so sweet. But I can't possibly go now... the sink is full of dirty dishes, the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess..."
Marge,What about Maggie?
Marge,Don't do that!
Marge,"Well, all right, but I'm taking some of the ironing with me in the car."
Marge,"This is so relaxing. Homie, this was a wonderful idea."
Marge,It's like I'm on some wonderful drug!
Marge,What's going on here?
Marge,Squalid hell hole... toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion... Dogs mating on dining room table?
Marge,What are you doing with my children?!
Marge,What?! No! You can't! I won't let you!
Marge,Parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times...
Marge,I can't believe I put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. That is so like me.
Marge,Can you see them?
Marge,That's it. We're going downtown to get our kids back. Right now!
Marge,"We've always tried to be good parents. Please, I'm begging you, one mother to another -- you must have a family."
Marge,It's Maggie!
Marge,...and then I saw my boy in a burlap sack and they told me he had lice!
Marge,This is so humiliating.
Marge,It's so quiet here without the kids.
Marge,"I miss the way Bart would say something and then say ""dude."""
Marge,You mean Maggie?
Marge,We've never been separated from the kids for so long. I don't know how much more I can take.
Marge,There's Bart's ring!
Marge,"Well, look at the other side."
Marge,"Oh, my."
Marge,"The only thing I'm high on is love. Love for my son and daughters. Yes, a little ""L.S.D."" is all I need."
Marge,We missed you so much!
Marge,He's going to baptize our children?
Marge,Where we going? Where we going?
Marge,"Oh, Maggie, you're a Simpson again!"
Marge,"So, what was it like at the Flanders' house?"
Marge,"Aw, honey, you're not a monster."
Marge,"Hmm. Bart, what's wrong? There's something a little off about your hug."
Marge,"Uh, uh, uh, let me guess. A mother can always tell. Hmm, it's not fear of nuclear war. Hmm, it's not swim test anxiety. It almost feels like you're missing something. Something important."
Marge,An alligator with sunglasses? Now I've seen everything!
Marge,Street signs? Indoors?! Whatever.
Marge,Oooh. These look good. Guilt-Free Steakfish Filets.
Marge,"Ooo, tres bien."
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"I think it's nice we're doing something Maggie will enjoy for once. Besides, I'm sure Storytown Village is also fun for everyone... from 8, to... God only knows."
Marge,This is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house!
Marge,"That's it, Honey. Get into the spirit."
Marge,You're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there.
Marge,Oh my.
Marge,See? It was a good idea to come here after all.
Marge,"Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting."
Marge,"Why thank you, Homie. You might say the extra ingredient is salt."
Marge,What's wrong Lisa? Didn't you get enough lamb chops?
Marge,"Bart, sensible bites! All right Lisa. If you don't want lamb chops, there's lots of other things I can make: chicken breast, rump roast, hot dogs..."
Marge,YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...
Marge,I didn't mean to take sides. I just got caught up in the rhythm.
Marge,"Bart, no!"
Marge,"Sorry, force of habit. Lisa, no!"
Marge,"Please pass your father the syrup, Lisa."
Marge,"Tell him yourself. You're ignoring Lisa, not Bart."
Marge,"Homer, you're not not talking to me. And secondly, I heard what you said."
Marge,Homer! Where did you get that?
Marge,That giant donut.
Marge,"Homer! Just give him the donut. Once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror."
Marge,Sometimes.
Marge,These monsters are destroying everything and everyone we hold dear! And you kids should have jackets on.
Marge,"Homer, stop looking!"
Marge,I don't see what that has to do with Groundskeeper Willie.
Marge,"Kids, it's time we told you the true story and put your fears to rest. It's a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave."
Marge,It all started on the thirteenth hour of the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month. We were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased.
Marge,Homer? Get ready. Patty and Selma will be here any minute.
Marge,Just a second!
Marge,Homer? Where are you?
Marge,"Do you see towels? If you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again."
Marge,We better call Ned. He has a ladder.
Marge,No.
Marge,"Bart, no!"
Marge,"Bart, what happened?!"
Marge,"Oh, Homie..."
Marge,Here's your lemonade and here's your beer.
Marge,"Oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. When's your next coffee break?"
Marge,"Hi. Ah, er, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. Did you put on a little weight this week?"
Marge,Have you lost your mind?! Have you thought about your health?... Or your appearance?
Marge,"Oh please, I would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--"
Marge,Normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on TV. But this season...
Marge,"I'd like to, honey, but I'm not sure how. Your father can be surprisingly sensitive. Remember when I giggled at his Sherlock Holmes hat? He sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency."
Marge,"You're right. Maybe if I use my least nagging tone of voice. Homer? Homer! Homer! That's it. That's the one. All right, send him on in."
Marge,"Homer, we need to have a serious talk."
Marge,"Let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we?"
Marge,Con: You're endangering your health.
Marge,Con: You're setting a bad example for the children.
Marge,Con: You're running the air conditioner non-stop. It's freezing in here.
Marge,Con: I am finding myself less attracted to you physically.
Marge,There's no cake.
Marge,Good. Good for you.
Marge,I'm going out. I run errands during the day.
Marge,I'm so proud. That's my husband wedged in that hatch.
Marge,Bart!
Marge,What are you talking about?
Marge,What?!
Marge,"That's ridiculous. Homer's not dead, he's right out back in the hammock."
Marge,A tombstone?!
Marge,"Get out of here, you ghouls!"
Marge,"Oy, yoy yoy yoy yoy."
Marge,"Uh, excuse me, sir, I think there's been a mistake."
Marge,Homer?
Marge,"When I asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you told me ""no."" You go downtown first thing in the morning and straighten this out."
Marge,I don't know what to say. I finally have a mother-in-law. No more living vicariously through my girlfriends!
Marge,She's nice.
Marge,I just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. You could get hurt again.
Marge,Which was?
Marge,"Oh, Homie. C'mon, you're a sweet, kind, loving man. I'm sure you were a wonderful son."
Marge,Let's find out.
Marge,"Mother Simpson, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your past."
Marge,"So, Mother Simpson, where did your new-found sense of irresponsibility take you?"
Marge,"I'm so sorry I misjudged you, Mom. You had to leave to protect your family."
Marge,Yeah.
Marge,"This year, I'm making earplugs out of biscuit dough!"
Marge,They're ready.
Marge,Sweet dreams.
Marge,Five tires?! Am I seeing things?
Marge,"Well, maybe my headache will go away once the show starts."
Marge,Do they have to play that rock music?! Every note is pounding into my skull!
Marge,Yay.
Marge,"Kids, everything's going to be okay! Don't panic! Just don't panic!"
Marge,We can always get more shoes! MoveMoveMove!
Marge,Wait!! Wait! My children are in there!
Marge,I feel so helpless. What if something happens to them?
Marge,"Well, at least they're wearing clean underwear."
Marge,Sleep tight.
Marge,"Oh, my little sugar-bug... I'm so glad you're safe..."
Marge,...go again.
Marge,"Goodnight, Lisa."
Marge,Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Marge,"ROCKABYE BABY IN THE TREE TOP / WHEN THE WIND BLOWS / THE CRADLE WILL ROCK / WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS / THE CRADLE WILL FALL / AND DOWN WILL COME BABY, CRADLE AND ALL."
Marge,Sweet dreams.
Marge,"Goodnight, dear."
Marge,"All right, climb in."
Marge,Fresh chocolate chip cookies.
Marge,"Don't touch those yet. They're very, very hot."
Marge,They're all gone. The whole batch.
Marge,"Did you eat the cookies, Maggie."
Marge,Go on Maggie.
Marge,Well Homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
Marge,"Well, duh."
Marge,Go crazy?
Marge,"Lawyers... lawyers. Ooh, Lionel Hutz. ""Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free."""
Marge,Bart! Stop pestering Satan!
Marge,But we did win!
Marge,"Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you're recovered and we can all get back to normal."
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"I'm sorry, honey, but those games cost up to and including seventy dollars. And they're violent and they distract you from your schoolwork."
Marge,Tuck-in time!
Marge,ALL ABOARD THE SLEEPY TRAIN / TO VISIT MOTHER GOOSE / BARTY'S STOP IS SNOOZY LANE / TO REST HIS SWEET CABOOSE.
Marge,"Well, if loving my kids is ""lame,"" then I guess I'm just a big lame."
Marge,"Well, life is like a box of chocolates --"
Marge,-- You never know what --
Marge,--- you're gonna get...
Marge,Ninety-nine cents!
Marge,"Homer, didn't you get any milk? All I see is egg nog."
Marge,"Bart, get your suit on."
Marge,We're getting our Christmas picture taken.
Marge,"Oh, good. So get ready, and before you know it we'll be at the Try-N-Save."
Marge,"Ahh, my teapots are ready."
Marge,"Bart, what's taking so long? If you're having that problem with your zipper, I can send your father up."
Marge,What's the matter with your face? Is that a fake nose? Are you wearing chin putty?
Marge,"Please, Bart, no more pranks. It would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo."
Marge,Uh-oh. Almost forgot to lock the doors.
Marge,Okay.
Marge,"Sure. We're gonna have a great day. Ba-da-bing ba-da-boom, right Bart? Bart?"
Marge,"What's wrong, honey?"
Marge,"Oh, Homie. Look at that watch. I've always wanted a watch like that."
Marge,Wait! Wait! I don't want Maggie's face hidden behind that pacifier.
Marge,That's crazy! Bart's not a shoplifter! He's just a little boy!
Marge,"My son may not be perfect, but I know in my heart he's not a shoplifter."
Marge,Fine. Play the tape. Then everyone can see you've got the wrong boy.
Marge,"Oh, Bart."
Marge,I know you are...
Marge,I don't know. Why don't you go to bed?
Marge,Lisa's on the sleepy train / To rest her weary head / Her ticket is a candy cane / Made out of gingerbread.
Marge,"Goodnight, sweetheart."
Marge,Goodnight.
Marge,"I always thought I understood my special little guy. But somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine."
Marge,He's not my little baby anymore. Maybe I mother him too much.
Marge,Here's your hot chocolate.
Marge,I think you're old enough to do it yourself now.
Marge,I didn't think you'd mind. I figured you were getting a little too old for this. But you can still make one. There's some snow left under the car.
Marge,We're almost finished. There's just a little bit of green left.
Marge,There you are! You can help me spray the cookies...
Marge,Are you hiding something? What do you have under your jacket?
Marge,"Oh, Bart, not again... Give it to me."
Marge,"You can't hide from me in this house, Bart! I spend 23 hours a day here!"
Marge,"There's no place left to run, Bart. Hand it over."
Marge,"Oh, Bart. I can't believe you did this."
Marge,"Oh, Sweetie. This is the best present a mother could get."
Marge,"I love you so much, my little Bitty Barty."
Marge,"Since I got my present early, I think you should get yours early too."
Marge,"Lisa, you have to wait."
Marge,"Now, I know you love video games, and I asked the clerk which is the one every boy wants..."
Marge,"Homie, you want pork chops?"
Marge,Those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
Marge,"No, I will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!"
Marge,It's sick! And I don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. Like Mr. Burns.
Marge,For what?
Marge,All right.
Marge,Uh-huh.
Marge,Ooh.
Marge,Who knocked down the pins?
Marge,Good for him!
Marge,I can't believe Otto picked up a 7-10 split. He's phenomenal!
Marge,Wow!
Marge,Bart! Where do you pick up words like that?
Marge,Homer! Watch your mouth!
Marge,"Homer, maybe Mr. Burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship."
Marge,Why don't you read something?
Marge,"Well, you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale."
Marge,You'd get some fresh air and exercise.
Marge,"Can we get rid of this ""Ayatollah"" T-shirt? Khomeini died years ago."
Marge,"I don't care who's consolidating their power. Well, we don't need this."
Marge,"Who's ""Disco Stu?"""
Marge,"Are you interested in that motorized tie rack, Principal Skinner?"
Marge,"Well, you can always take the motor out and use it as an ordinary tie rack..."
Marge,No.
Marge,You didn't vote for anybody.
Marge,"Homie. As long as you keep the car full of gas, I'm happy."
Marge,"Grampa, I know in your day spanking was common, but Homer and I just don't believe in that kind of punishment."
Marge,President Bush is driving on our lawn! He must be lost.
Marge,"Well Homer, too. They're so much alike."
Marge,Bye bye!
Marge,We can't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy. We just need a TV. We're going to go to the outlet mall in Ogdenville.
Marge,"Honey, I don't think these clothes are us..."
Marge,"Oh, it's beautiful. Can it be real Chanel?"
Marge,It is.
Marge,90 dollars?!
Marge,"It fits like a dream, too. But we can't afford $90 even if it is a bargain. It wouldn't be right to buy something just for me. If it were a suit we could all wear, maybe, then..."
Marge,"Oh, sure I do. I treated myself to a Sanka not three days ago. But this is a real find."
Marge,"Alright, I will buy it. It'll be good for the economy."
Marge,"Really? You like it? Oh, I'd love to wear this someplace special."
Marge,What about the symphony -- or the theater?
Marge,"I used to be a little overwhelmed, too, but it's not that hard. I can show you."
Marge,"yeah. Hi, Evelyn."
Marge,I did marry Homer.
Marge,"Ninety percent of the time, if the gas isn't pumping, this is your problem."
Marge,"We ran with different crowds. You had your debutante balls and skinny-dipping, and I had my home shoe repair course."
Marge,"Bart, comb your hair. Homer, I don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie."
Marge,"If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?"
Marge,"I've told you, I don't like you using the word hotbed. Please, Lisa, we so rarely get to do things like this. And everybody -- everybody, please -- be on your best behavior. Bart, no grifting."
Marge,We're not poor.
Marge,"Well, we're not."
Marge,"Ohhh. I've always dreamed of coming here. Everybody keep smiling, and I know we're going fit right in."
Marge,Pleased to meet you. You look like such a happy bunch... of people.
Marge,"Oh, that reminds me of a funny apron I saw..."
Marge,"I get food through the mail, but in a different way. Every month Good Housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes. Sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself."
Marge,"Didn't everybody have a wonderful time? I thought it was so opulent -- like the Playboy Mansion, but non-sexual."
Marge,"Yes. They're better. Socially better. And if we fit in, we can be better too. So today, while the rest of you were out being different, I did a very good job of fitting in. So good that Evelyn gave us a guest pass. They might even ask us to join!"
Marge,"Oh, don't thank me. Thank my beautiful new suit."
Marge,Queen of Hearts. I believe all the rest are ours.
Marge,"Homer, please. I have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow."
Marge,"Why thank you, Roberta."
Marge,"Oh, that would be a dream come true. I'll be there with bells on!"
Marge,"All right, all right, but if you win, don't make a scene and dance around with your ""woo-hoos,"" please. We can't afford a single slip-up. They're judging us."
Marge,"I don't know. Lisa, tonight is very important. Mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one."
Marge,"I really need to concentrate on this, Lisa, would you mind--"
Marge,"...I've already altered this so many times, it's nearly impossible to..."
Marge,"LISA, PLEASE!!"
Marge,No-No-NO-NO-NOOO!
Marge,"At times like this, I guess all you can do is laugh."
Marge,I need a formal dress for tonight!
Marge,"Mmm, it's a bit peppery for me. Why don't we put this in the ""maybe"" pile."
Marge,Uh-huh.
Marge,Miss... Miss! Do you have a Chanel suit or any other high-quality clothes?
Marge,"Oh, I give up."
Marge,"No, I can't. C'mon, let's go."
Marge,The outlet store.
Marge,Call it fate. Let's go...
Marge,A dollar. Let's go.
Marge,Without. Let me go!
Marge,Why do you have to question everything I do?!!
Marge,"Homer, what are you doing?"
Marge,We can't drive this up there. They'll see the dent. They'll see the coat hanger antenna. Stop the car. We're walking.
Marge,"No, no, no! Not tonight! No vulgarity, no mischief, no politics. Just be good."
Marge,"Come here, Maggie."
Marge,"Oh, Homie, I like your in-your-face humanity. I like the way Lisa speaks her mind. I like Bart's... I like Bart. And I like my old green dress. I didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown."
Marge,"Don't worry, I saved the receipt. We'll have a $3,300 credit at Chanel."
Marge,"C'mon, let's go. I wouldn't want to join any club that would have this me as a member."
Marge,"But, you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place like this."
Marge,"Oh, isn't that somewhat unusual?"
Marge,"What are you going to spend your money on, kids?"
Marge,Tacos! Public Broadcasting! I won't have you kids throwing your money away like that. You're both coming downtown with me and you're gonna put that money in the bank.
Marge,No.
Marge,You'll feel better knowing your money's in the hands of professionals.
Marge,A professional in an ape mask is still a professional.
Marge,"Checking accounts aren't really for children, Bart."
Marge,Seven hundred dollars.
Marge,"Yes, dear. In your mind."
Marge,On the street in your mind.
Marge,"Sweetheart, maybe you just want Krusty to be alive so badly, you think you see him everywhere. I went through the same thing when Lyndon Johnson died."
Marge,Ye olde toast.
Marge,What kind of apprentice?
Marge,Toast.
Marge,"Lisa, honey, when my family first came to this state, they had a choice of living in Springfield or Stenchburg. You know why they chose Springfield? Because everyone knows Jebediah Springfield was a true American hero. End of story."
Marge,"Boy, it sure would be fun to carpool in one of those, huh, kids? I'd be a real hot-rod mama, wouldn't I? Huh? Huh?"
Marge,I wish I'd pay more attention.
Marge,"You know, Homer, assisting Mr. Burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
Marge,Sor-ry. Next time get your own darned corn.
Marge,"Homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. ""Little Rascals"" isn't on 'til 6."
Marge,"Ah, poor Homie. Poor, poor..."
Marge,"Kids, stop exploiting your father. Homie, why don't you lie down and relax."
Marge,Simpson! Lie down!
Marge,"Sorry, but you need a good night's rest."
Marge,"Is there something wrong, Homie?"
Marge,Except...
Marge,"Okay. Maybe everything's all right. Maybe if you go apologize, he won't even fire you. If he's alive."
Marge,"Cheer up, Homie."
Marge,"Bart, Lisa! It's 11 o'clock at night. Where do you think you're going?"
Marge,"I won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night. Homer, you go, too."
Marge,"Well, if it's just for one more night."
Marge,Oh dear.
Marge,That does it. One of them has to go.
Marge,No. The b-u-m.
Marge,Umm... How about... Ghostmutt?
Marge,"What are you going to do with all your money, Mr. Lampwick?"
Marge,But?
Marge,"Wait, kids. You can't give up on Itchy and Scratchy. You're always so good at these things. Why, together you've reunited Krusty with his father, gotten Principal Skinner his job back, and helped Dr. Riviera perform open-heart surgery on your father. You've even foiled Sideshow Bob on five separate occasions, and he's an evil genius."
Marge,You kids must be so happy. Your cute little cartoon friends are back on the air.
Marge,"That's not a leather muppet, that's Troy McClure. Oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob!"
Marge,What are you talking about?
Marge,"Homer! That's just an urban legend. People don't do that type of thing with fish. Troy McClure is a perfect gentlemen, like Bing Crosby or JFK. I wonder where Troy is now?"
Marge,Sounds like you're really falling for him.
Marge,"Patty! Go on, Selma, tell me more."
Marge,It was a beautiful wedding. I've never seen Selma happier.
Marge,"What?!! Oh, my God!"
Marge,Selma... about you and Troy. We're not sure he's... all he seems.
Marge,Selma! Troy doesn't love you at all! He's only using you to squelch the rumors about his bizarre personal life and further his career!
Marge,"I'm honored, Bart. And Lisa, you'll have a fine time at the plant with Dad. You've been interested in nuclear power for years."
Marge,"Well, there you go."
Marge,"""Parent's occupation... Please note: Homemaker is not allowed, as it is not real work. That's why you don't get paid for it."""
Marge,"Oh, but he so wanted to see women in the workplace..."
Marge,"Of course! Of course! I would never, ever have thought of that!"
Marge,"The National Grammar Rodeo! I wish I were going. Oh, wait, wait -- I mean, I wish I was going. Is that right, Bart?"
Marge,"Oh, honey, you've had your glory. Now it's Bart's turn."
Marge,"Hello?... Oh, Homie, hello! I can't remember the last time you called me from -- Oh, you want to speak to Lisa?"
Marge,"With Bart gone, and now you and your father, I'm not going to have anyone to--"
Marge,I can't take this anymore!
Marge,"Aw, aw, there, there, oh, Maggie... There..."
Marge,Of course I'll accept! Bart! I've missed you so mu-- You want to speak to Lisa?
Marge,"Hello? Oh, hello, Principal Skinner... No, Bart has never been to Hong Kong... Goodnight."
Marge,"Hello? Tennessee State Police? No, my son's car was not crushed in Knoxville. I don't know where to begin telling you what's wrong with that."
Marge,"Hello? No, Bart is not available tomorrow to deliver a human kidney to Amsterdam!"
Marge,"Homer, are you laughing at me?"
Marge,Why not.
Marge,Are you sure? Maybe it's just shampoo. That washes right out.
Marge,"Wait -- if I remember my Heloise, the trick to getting out gum is peanut butter."
Marge,There. Now that gum should lift right out.
Marge,"Hmmm... Maybe it needs a little mayonnaise to get going. Okay, you go sit in the sun and let it melt in."
Marge,"Oh, we've tried everything. Olive oil, lemon juice, tartar sauce, chocolate syrup, gravy, bacon fat, hummus and baba ghanouj..."
Marge,It's Grampa. And it sounds like he's gotten into the horseradish again.
Marge,But where are we going to put him?
Marge,Bart's room.
Marge,"Well, things were bad everywhere."
Marge,It's hard to believe someone so close to our family could be an illegal alien.
Marge,"So Apu, why didn't you go back to India when your student visa expired?"
Marge,Uh-huh.
Marge,"What you're saying is so understandable... and really, your only crime was violating U.S. law."
Marge,"You know what? I'm going to vote ""no"" on 24."
Marge,"Oh, Homer. Are you rounding up immigrants?"
Marge,"But Apu, the vote on Proposition 24 is Tuesday. You'll have to pass the test before then."
Marge,Just thank heaven everything worked out for the people we care about.
Marge,"""Dear parents. Due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks. By reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity, throughout the universe."""
Marge,"What's wrong, Homie?"
Marge,"Record stores have always seemed crazy to me, but it doesn't upset me. Music is none of my business."
Marge,"Well, good. Try to include Bart and Lisa."
Marge,So you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
Marge,Of course you have a choice.
Marge,You don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along.
Marge,This is so exciting. Last time I got to go backstage was when Bart ripped his pants at the Christmas play.
Marge,Now this I like.
Marge,Cannons are designed to hurt. They're designed to hurt.
Marge,There might be one in this cooler.
Marge,Oh. Here we go.
Marge,"Am I cool, kids?"
Marge,"Good. I'm glad. And that's what makes me cool -- not caring, right?"
Marge,"Well, how the hell do you be cool? I feel like we've tried everything here."
Marge,"... And you're sure the Flanderses won't be there? Well, it sounds great!"
Marge,"Bart, you can invite Milhouse. Lisa, you can bring a friend, too."
Marge,"Well, did you call one of your friends?"
Marge,"Girls, Lisa. Boys kiss girls."
Marge,"We have each other! When I was a lonely little girl, I always dreamed that someday my daughter would be my best friend."
Marge,"Honey, you'll make plenty of friends. All you have to do is be yourself."
Marge,"Wave bye-bye to our house, Maggie. Bye-bye, tree."
Marge,"It's called Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport. It's known as ""America's scrod-basket."""
Marge,"No, Springfield is ""America's crud-bucket."" At least according to Newsweek."
Marge,That was thoughtful.
Marge,Put food in me.
Marge,"Well, duh! With what, Ned?"
Marge,"Isn't this fun, honey?"
Marge,"I know you're joking -- but it is! Say, why don't you put on your swimsuit and head for the beach?"
Marge,"Lisa, that's not at all like you."
Marge,"Oh, okay."
Marge,"Ohhhh, how about this adorable sun-suit. It has a starfish on the fanny and it comes with its own pail!"
Marge,So where do you want to show off your new hip togs? The Sherbet Shoppe? The Candle District? Big Sue's Tap Water Taffy?
Marge,Oh... okay.
Marge,You'll be my friend. I'm never gonna let you get away.
Marge,"Because it was the only one in the house. Come on, Homer, open the door for your Mystery Date!"
Marge,"Okay, Bart, your turn, your turn."
Marge,"You got ""The Dud!"""
Marge,"Gee, I don't know what you've got planned for tonight, Homer, but count me out. Didn't you buy any meat?"
Marge,I don't think you should. Let Lisa be alone with her new friends.
Marge,"Oh, you haven't said that in four years. Let Lisa have it."
Marge,"No! Now park your keister, meester!"
Marge,"Hey, kids, there's a carnival tonight!"
Marge,Kids! Stop that! Don't make me get the carney!
Marge,"Remember, kids, there's no need to bump! Just enjoy the ride!"
Marge,"The polite thing to do would've been to clean the shells first. Shoo, shoo!"
Marge,"Homer, isn't it about time for the... ...you know."
Marge,"Three! We have three kids, Homer!"
Marge,You went into the attic? I'm very disappointed and terrified.
Marge,"Yes, Doctor, it's what we've always feared: it's loose. Hugo is loose. See you soon."
Marge,"I'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, Bart. You see... you have a brother."
Marge,I think I'll bottle-feed that one.
Marge,It saved our marriage!
Marge,"Oh, finish your fish heads. Then we'll talk."
Marge,Lisa! Breakfast! We're having waffles!
Marge,"I'm sorry, honey. The waffle iron's in the shop."
Marge,That's Slick Willie for you. Always with the smooth talk.
Marge,Move us?
Marge,Ow! I don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a planet I never even heard of.
Marge,You took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with your family?
Marge,"We have roots here, Homer. We have friends and family and library cards... Bart's lawyer is here."
Marge,What lifelong dream?
Marge,"Homer, I don't want to leave Springfield. I've dug myself into a happy little rut here and I'm not about to hoist myself out of it."
Marge,Homer! You're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
Marge,It does seem nicer than Springfield.
Marge,"Well, we could use the extra money... and this house is falling apart."
Marge,All right.
Marge,"Even if we sell the house, we still won't come close to paying off the mortgage."
Marge,"Mr. Scorpio, this house is almost too good for us. I keep expecting to get the bum's rush."
Marge,"Okay, the oven is cleaning itself, the autovac's on dirt patrol... Annnd Maggie's enjoying her Swingamajig..."
Marge,"I can't believe it! I've done all my housework and it's only 9:30! Well, better go upstairs and make sure the beds are still made."
Marge,Guess I can't complain. Everything's perfect here.
Marge,"I knew you'd do well, Homer."
Marge,"I've been so bored since we moved here, I've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. I know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but I just can't drink that much."
Marge,"It's up to you, Homer. Whatever you decide, that's what we'll do."
Marge,I think owning the Denver Broncos is pretty good.
Marge,Well explain to me why it isn't.
Marge,Weren't there three Indians last year?
Marge,"No, I don't."
Marge,"Homer, please, you're hurting my arm!"
Marge,"Night vision goggles? A bathroom scale from a Soviet sub? A suede briefcase-case? Oh, anyone who needs this kind of status symbol must have some terrible emotional problems..."
Marge,"Homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. You're thirty-eight years old, you don't know how to box and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. Before you even consider this, I insist you consult a doctor."
Marge,A competent doctor!
Marge,That's what we get for living in a state founded by circus freaks.
Marge,"Homer, why are they saying you're going to fight Drederick Tatum?"
Marge,Have you lost your mind?!
Marge,But you'll get killed!
Marge,"Moe, I'm so glad I found you. Please promise me you won't let Homer get hurt."
Marge,"Listen to me. The instant that Homer's in any kind of danger, I want you to throw in this towel and stop the fight."
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,"Celebrities at ringside tonight: star of the ""McBain"" action films and featured player in the Hollywood prostitution scandal, Rainier Wolfcastle; TV anchorman and Springfield institution, Mr. Kent Brockman."
Marge,What? What?! What am I missing? What?
Marge,"Homer! Homer, he's not going to get tired! You've got to hit him back! Hit him back!"
Marge,Somebody stop the fight! Where's the doctor?!
Marge,"Oh, Homie, are you okay?"
Marge,"Oh, that's all right. We'll just wait until everyone else leaves."
Marge,"Thank you, Moe. I know you gave up your dreams for Homer."
Marge,I feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the seventh game of the World Series!
Marge,"Next to spring and winter, fall is my absolute favorite season. Just look at all this beautiful foilage."
Marge,"That's what I said, foilage . It doesn't take a nucular scientist to pronounce foilage."
Marge,"I can honestly say that was the most fun I've ever had. The mill, the history, all that gorgeous foliage."
Marge,"I can't excape Lisa, our little walking libary!"
Marge,No! What if he's crazy?
Marge,We're not picking him up!
Marge,There's not enough room!
Marge,I just don't think it's a good idea.
Marge,Careful of the apple pie on the seat.
Marge,"Grampa, are you sitting on the pie?"
Marge,He sexually harassed me.
Marge,"Yay, Mom! All right, Mom!"
Marge,I think we heard enough about Larry Burns for one evening.
Marge,What are you doing in the basement? It's like you're hiding out down here.
Marge,And what's that hitchhiker doing here? Is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?
Marge,Oh. Yeah. Thank you.
Marge,Can't we just go upstairs?
Marge,Kidnapped?!
Marge,You know how I feel about hoaxes!
Marge,"I want you to take Larry back to Mr. Burns right now, before you get in a lot of trouble."
Marge,No excuses! Just do it!
Marge,"Ohhh! Give yourself up, Homie!"
Marge,And where is all that liquor coming from?
Marge,"Honey, we don't need to drive 400 miles to clean animals. You can stay right here and give the dog a bath. Or trim the cat's nails."
Marge,You've already used up your birthday and Christmas presents on that peach tree we got you. And you hardly ever play with that anymore.
Marge,"Oh, all right, we'll go."
Marge,"Now, the cat needs his medication every morning --"
Marge,"And the furnace has been giving off a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window o--"
Marge,"Uh, you know, I think I'll take Maggie with us."
Marge,"And if anything happens, just use your best judgm... Just do what I would do."
Marge,I've got rocks that need washing at home.
Marge,"Oh, Lisa, I know it's frustrating. But we made a commitment and we have to see it through, no matter how unpleasant."
Marge,"""Maison Derriere""?! I can't believe there's a place like that in our wholesome little town. Homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent Bart to work there?"
Marge,"What were you thinking, sending Bart to such an awful place?"
Marge,I have a favor to ask: please shut this place down and move away from Springfield.
Marge,Springfield doesn't want places like this!
Marge,Oh? I've lived in this town for 37 years.
Marge,I'm third generation.
Marge,Get out of my town!
Marge,"Is that so? Well, sleazy entertainment and raunchy jokes will never be as popular as sobriety and self-denial!"
Marge,You're about to learn the two most dangerous words in the English language are Marge Simpson!
Marge,It's the light pink '87 wagon.
Marge,"I'm here to share my moral outrage, but this time it's not about that giant, inflatable Dos Equis bottle. It's about a certain house in our town..."
Marge,No. It's a House of Ill Fame... a House of Loose Ethics...
Marge,The house is perfectly fine!
Marge,"Oh, geez -- It's what's inside the house that's disgraceful -- drinking, gambling, and debauchery! It's right under our noses -- a secret house of burlesque!"
Marge,I rest my case.
Marge,"Here I come, everybody!"
Marge,"No, I had to go rent the bulldozer."
Marge,What about the sleaze and the depravity?!
Marge,"Oh, can you sing it again?"
Marge,"Well, I also have a song to sing!"
Marge,Don't make up your mind until you hear both songs! Morals and ethics and carnal forbearance...
Marge,Uh... sorry.
Marge,I'm so sorry. How can I ever make this up to you?
Marge,"So, Twiggy, I hear you and your husband Woody just had a baby. What did you name him?"
Marge,Is it really necessary to watch TV while we're eating? We're getting food all over.
Marge,You're talking about a trough! We're not going to eat from a trough! And another thing -- it's only 5:15. Why are you in your underwear?
Marge,"At least let's have a civilized conversation, shall we? Lisa, how was school?"
Marge,School. School.
Marge,I know it's not! I'm going into the dining room to have a conversation. Anyone who wants to join me is welcome.
Marge,Hello Marge. How's the family? I don't want to talk about it. Mind your own business.
Marge,"Homer, is this the way you pictured married life?"
Marge,"Well, I pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. I pictured napkins... Homer, I want to throw a dinner party."
Marge,"I don't care if the sink shoots sludge, we're having a party."
Marge,"It's just not a dinner party without a melon baller. And we'll need a citrus zester... a ravioli crimper... Ooh, an oyster mallet! ""Made in U.S.A.""? Eh, no thank you!"
Marge,Well... maybe we could use it once and then return it.
Marge,"Bart, company's coming. Go put doilies under the coasters. Hurry! Hurry!"
Marge,"Lisa, quick. Screw these back on."
Marge,"Oh, good. That will give me time to add another coat of glaze to the ham."
Marge,Homer?!
Marge,Are you ready?
Marge,The only thing I asked you to do for this party was put on clothes. And you didn't do it.
Marge,"And now it's too late -- they're here. Bart, greet our guests and take their coats."
Marge,"So, did anyone see that new Woodsy Allen movie?"
Marge,So who wants to play a game? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?
Marge,Maybe we should all have a few drinks.
Marge,Lisa! Why don't you come sing for us!
Marge,I feel terrible. The Van Houtens split up at our party.
Marge,"I shouldn't have served those North Korean fortune cookies. They were so insulting: ""You are a coward."" No one likes to hear that after a nice meal."
Marge,You know who the real victim is in all this? Milhouse.
Marge,"I must say, Luann, you're really handling this splendidly."
Marge,"Actually, Luann, I don't really know anything about yo--"
Marge,"Homer, get ready!"
Marge,Remember? Luann and Chase are taking us out to hear Spalding Gray.
Marge,You said you'd do it as a favor to me.
Marge,Fine. I'll go without you.
Marge,"Homie, I appreciate this, but I'd really like to get some sleep."
Marge,"Edmondo, don't you think you're taking a lot off -- Ah!... Homer! What are you doing?!"
Marge,None! They would have more sense than that.
Marge,"Homer, I don't need you around me 24 hours a day. I'm a grown woman -- I can take care of myself. Now, will you please just go away!"
Marge,"Only three cavities, Bart. Your best check-up ever. I'm going to make you my specialty -- butterscotch chicken."
Marge,Why? Am I pregnant?
Marge,"Oh, Homie. I know you love me. We don't need to get married again."
Marge,What?
Marge,We never will.
Marge,"I will. Oh Homie, of course I will."
Marge,It's the most perfect wedding I could ever ask for. You even got a hip rock 'n' roll combo.
Marge,What a wonderful evening! A magical way for two people to renew their love.
Marge,"An automatic dialer? Is that legal? I don't want you getting arrested, Homer..."
Marge,Or swindling our neighbors.
Marge,But you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars. It's nothing but panhandling!
Marge,"Well, most women will tell you that you're a fool to think you can change a man... but those women are quitters!"
Marge,"When I first met your father, he was loud, crude, and piggish. But I worked hard on him, and now he's a whole new person!"
Marge,"He's a whole new person, Lisa!"
Marge,"Ooh, a Rubik's Cube. Let's all work it together."
Marge,"It's true, but he shouldn't say it."
Marge,"Oh, there's so little left: Creamed Eels? Corn Nog? Wadded beef?"
Marge,Why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
Marge,My main finger?
Marge,One at a time.
Marge,Now I remember why I put
Marge,this down here in the first place!
Marge,It's dying down!
Marge,"Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If you stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all our friends. So if you could find it in your infinite wisdom to..."
Marge,Remarkable -- there doesn't seem to be any damage at all. It just goes to show you that everything will work out if you have faith.
Marge,I'm sure your insurance will cover the house.
Marge,Ned! Maude! You've got to go back to your house. Something incredible has happened!
Marge,No! Come on!
Marge,"I started making some calls last night, and before I knew it, practically all of Springfield was offering to help."
Marge,"Ned, we meant well, and everyone here tried their best --"
Marge,The man who lived next door until his house blew down.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Homer, I happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my face."
Marge,"Well, don't look at me... just because I'm holding a pair of scissors. Scissors which I need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains."
Marge,"Well, I just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco."
Marge,"No, Homie, wait!"
Marge,"All right, I was trying to keep it from you, but I had a good reason. Every time you go to that cook-off, you get drunk as a poet on payday. Remember last year?"
Marge,"Okay, we'll go to the Chili Cook-Off. But I want you to promise me you won't have any beer."
Marge,"Mmm, I suppose I could..."
Marge,"Ooh, look at that adorable spice rack!"
Marge,"Eight spices! Oh, some must be doubles. ""Or-uh-GAHN-o?"" What the hell...?"
Marge,Remember your promise: no drinking.
Marge,"Thank you for your concern, Helen. Homer isn't drinking today."
Marge,It looks so complicated... Do you know how?
Marge,Woo-woo!
Marge,You promised you wouldn't drink!
Marge,Has anyone seen Homer?
Marge,"No beer, huh? I guess I know what a promise from Homer J. Simpson is worth."
Marge,Your father decided he'd rather come home in a taxi. Or a police car.
Marge,"I'm ""cranky"" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. You broke your promise, Homer."
Marge,"Don't ""soul mate"" me!"
Marge,"Oh, Homer, thank goodness you're safe!"
Marge,"I woke up and you weren't there, and I was so worried..."
Marge,"Well, I was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. And I was sure you'd head west, because Springfield slopes down that way. And then I saw the lighthouse, and I remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron..."
Marge,Yeah.
Marge,...we had a fight?
Marge,...and you're from Mars.
Marge,"Homer, don't you see? Our differences are only skin-deep..."
Marge,...a profound mystical understanding?
Marge,Space coyote?
Marge,We'll all be killed!
Marge,We did it!
Marge,Bad dog!
Marge,Bad cat!
Marge,Bad fawn! Hmm. Shoo! Shoo!
Marge,"Homer, it's two a.m.! What happened?"
Marge,Have you been drinking?
Marge,More sausage?
Marge,Good doggy. Good doggy!
Marge,"Hello, can I help you?"
Marge,"I-Is this about that pen that I took from the Post Office? I-I swear I didn't know I put it in my purse. Then I was going to bring it back, but the dog chewed it up and that just made things worse..."
Marge,Oh. Come. Come in.
Marge,"I don't believe you, Homer."
Marge,You're not listening. You're only hearing what you want to hear.
Marge,"Homer, please! I try to be supportive, but this has gone too far. Please just let it be."
Marge,"Please, let's just go to sleep."
Marge,"No, I'm not."
Marge,"These shirts are a hundred per cent cotton! And look at the fine stitching on ""Dope!"""
Marge,"Oh Homie! Homie, I'm so sorry I doubted you!"
Marge,"Well, you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it. I'm proud of you, Homie."
Marge,I'm not wild about these high-risk ventures. They sound a little risky.
Marge,"I guess I'm just not comfortable with the whole idea of ""investing""..."
Marge,"All right, Helen, if I'm not wanted, I'll leave."
Marge,...and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club.
Marge,"Well, maybe it's all for the best..."
Marge,It would be nice to beat those women at their own game. Maybe I should look into a franchise.
Marge,"Well, we're trying to, but you're blocking our way."
Marge,Now you're the one who's being naive.
Marge,"Oh, I don't want to own my own business. I don't know why I came here in the first place."
Marge,"Hello, Helen."
Marge,Edna.
Marge,Uh... oh...
Marge,"I'm sorry, Agnes."
Marge,Look at them. They've jumped on the one franchise I might possibly have considered thinking about becoming interested in. I'm not cut out for the world of business.
Marge,Mmm... hmm... That's not bad.
Marge,"Your franchise, how much?"
Marge,I'll take it!
Marge,When can I start? What's my territory?
Marge,Don't forget fat people. They can't stop eating!
Marge,"Hairnets, everyone."
Marge,Welcome to Pretzel Wagon. May I take your order?
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,Excuse me. I had this spot first.
Marge,"Well, I guess Macy's and Gimbel's learned to live side by side."
Marge,Very well. There must be dozens of great locations in this town. Don't you worry about me.
Marge,You see? A little persistence and patience paid off. That'll be 300 dollars.
Marge,"I should've said ""limit -- one per customer."""
Marge,"""Hang in there, baby."" You said it, kitty. Copyright 1968? Hmm. Determined or not, that cat must be long dead. That's kind of a downer."
Marge,Here you go -- free Pretzel Wagon pretzels for everyone! One bite and you'll be hooked!
Marge,"Oh, no! No! Don't do that! You're supposed to be tasting them!"
Marge,"I was wrong to have a dream. Wrong as usual. I mean, if you're nothing special, why kid yourself?"
Marge,"Listen to your mother, kids: aim low. Aim so low, no one will even care if you succeed."
Marge,"Dinner's in the oven. If you want some butter, it's under my face."
Marge,"Hello? Uh, no, Pretzel Wagon's no longer -- Three hundred pretzels?! Wait, wait, let me get this down. Mmm... Mmm... Meatpackers Union Hall... Batavia, New York... I'll send them right out! Homer, Homie, wake up! Wake up, I'm back in business!"
Marge,Are you sure the children will get enough nutrition from these pretzels?
Marge,"Oh my God, what happened to your fingers?!"
Marge,"Well, here I am -- 11905 Dead Weasel Road, but I don't see any apartment building, I just --"
Marge,"Hey, what's going on?"
Marge,"Oh, oh, you have to push in as you turn."
Marge,"Yeah, that's it."
Marge,Who are you?
Marge,What are you talking about?
Marge,"Homer, did you tell the Mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?"
Marge,"Oh, it just sickens me. How could you do this to someone you love?"
Marge,"Oh, Homer, I know you were trying to shield me from failure, but this is my business, and the Mafia's not getting one cent of my money!"
Marge,We're going to do what we do every day. We're going to make pretzels.
Marge,"There, that's the last one."
Marge,The answer is no.
Marge,"Homie, maybe we should go inside."
Marge,"Oh, I don't hate you for failing. I love you for trying."
Marge,"Oh, it's just a mob war. Go back to sleep, Honey."
Marge,"Don't worry, kids. This is a national park. We can have lots of fun."
Marge,"Okay, but when you start getting apple-cheeked, it's time to come in."
Marge,Bart? Lisa?
Marge,Hello?
Marge,"Excuse me, sir. I can't find my children."
Marge,No.
Marge,There they are! Let me down here.
Marge,"All right, kids. We'll meet you at the top. Just be careful!"
Marge,"We're over here, Homie!"
Marge,Can't you get it yourself?
Marge,"Oh, all right, all right, I'll get your milk!"
Marge,Does anyone else want anything while I'm up?
Marge,What?!
Marge,What kind of hair?
Marge,It's my hair. Excuse me.
Marge,All right... but don't be shocked.
Marge,"Homie, I'm losing my hair."
Marge,I was just with Dr. Hibbert. He said I was under a lot of stress and should get some help.
Marge,Well... I was thinking we could hire a nanny to help me out.
Marge,"Homie, please, I never ask for much, but this is something I really need."
Marge,Pleased to meet you.
Marge,"Homer, if you're going to do this to every applicant, we're never going to find one."
Marge,"I'm sorry, young man, you're not what we're looking for."
Marge,I heard that!
Marge,I guess we're not going to find anyone.
Marge,That's Carl.
Marge,"Well, I'd like to hear your suggestions."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Well that's nice, kids, but I don't know where we're going to find anyone like that."
Marge,No.
Marge,"Shary Bobbins, you're just what we're looking for."
Marge,"My, she seems too good to be true."
Marge,"Oh, I can see myself!"
Marge,"That Shary Bobbins is a miracle worker. The kids love her, the house is spotless -- and my hair's grown back. It's so full and thick it can support a beach umbrella!"
Marge,Ooooh.
Marge,"Oh, thank you."
Marge,Thank you for everything.
Marge,"Shary, you did the best you could. But you can't change this family. Neither can I. From now on I'm just gonna sit back and enjoy the ride."
Marge,Nope.
Marge,THE HOUSE IS STILL A MESS AND I'M GOING BALD FROM STRESS --
Marge,BUT WE'RE HAPPY JUST THE WAY WE ARE!
Marge,Thanks for everything!
Marge,Kids? Kids?
Marge,You're missing the Itchy and Scratchy Show! Don't you like it anymore?
Marge,An occasional hug is all I ask.
Marge,I do.
Marge,I need to purchase a brassiere. You kids wait over here in the credit department.
Marge,Mmm... okay. Just be careful.
Marge,"'Morning, Roy!"
Marge,I'm so glad you could join us for Homer's big premiere.
Marge,Shush everybody! It's coming on!
Marge,Yes we can!
Marge,Bart's right -- let's none of us have a cow. All that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.
Marge,"It's not your fault, Homer. It's those lousy writers. They make me madder than a, um... yak in heat!"
Marge,So?
Marge,"Oh, then I guess this is goodbye, Roy. Maybe we'll see you in a few years..."
Marge,"Well, I never thought it would come to this, but I guess we'll have to sell Grandma's Civil War doll."
Marge,"I'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear."
Marge,"Oh, Homer, look! Look! A TV Guide owned by Jackie O.!"
Marge,"Yes, I have something that I'd like to sell."
Marge,Nooo. It's an heirloom my grandmother passed down to me -- a very rare old figurine from the Civil War.
Marge,"Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. No. It's a very, very old figurine."
Marge,"Well, I guess it'll always be a monument to Grandma's secret drinking problem..."
Marge,...pimento nose... and voila! Mommy's patented Happy-Cracker Snack Platter!
Marge,Not really. They just had corn on them. Kitchen -- corn.
Marge,He is quite a charmer. Your father's certainly taken a shine to him...
Marge,"Mmm, I don't think he's married, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, didn't John seem a little... festive to you?"
Marge,He prefers the company of men!
Marge,"Homer, listen carefully: John is a ho-mo--"
Marge,... sexual.
Marge,You're being ridiculous.
Marge,"I'm very sorry you feel that way. Because John invited us all out for a drive today, and we're going."
Marge,What on earth are you talking about?
Marge,"Homer, at least come out and say hello."
Marge,Come on. You liked John this morning.
Marge,"Oh, geez Louise, you don't even know what you're worried about anymore. John's a witty, urbane person."
Marge,"I hope you all saved room, because I made your favorite dessert: store-bought snack cakes! Both kinds!"
Marge,"Homie, I can hear you chewing on your pillow. What's wrong?"
Marge,"So if you wore a Hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?"
Marge,"Homer, I don't think there's a problem with Bart. But if there is, it's probably because you're not spending any time with him. Goodnight."
Marge,"I don't, but I loved hearing it!"
Marge,"Homer, John brought us cactus candy!"
Marge,"Oh, Homer, please. You're embarrassing yourself."
Marge,"What? You never went hunting before, and you're perfectly straight!"
Marge,"Oh, Homie, I'm so glad you're safe! Hmmm, you feel softer than before."
Marge,"Just remember, Bart, convicts aren't ""cool."" They're bad people."
Marge,Someone should really go up there and talk to him.
Marge,Ho-mer.
Marge,"Oh, you have nothing to worry about, honey."
Marge,"We're very proud of you, by the way."
Marge,But he's safely locked away!
Marge,For life!
Marge,Which is impossible!
Marge,How can you even think of releasing Sideshow Bob?
Marge,"Bart, no!"
Marge,You can't ask God to kill someone!
Marge,"Oh, that sounds fabulous, Homer. Stores throw the best parties."
Marge,You didn't remember that. You just saw it on TV.
Marge,"Maybe people don't want an eight-year-old babysitter, honey. Parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen. That's why they hire teenagers."
Marge,"Uh, Grampa's not coming..."
Marge,"Actually, Bart, Lisa is going to be in charge tonight."
Marge,"I know she's young, but Lisa has proven herself mature and dependable."
Marge,"Well, we have to run. I'm sure you kids will work things out. Good night!"
Marge,"Make sure he brushes his teeth, Lisa."
Marge,"Uh, I don't think we should be driving here. The mayor's yelling at us."
Marge,"Oh, it's so beautiful! This is what I imagine Paris must be like!"
Marge,"I'm so honored that Springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. I guess this makes us ""yuppies,"" huh, Homie?"
Marge,"Oooh, Malaria Zone! That's where all the explorers shop."
Marge,Isn't that clever? It looks like a Cadillac drove right into the building.
Marge,"Oh my God, you walked into the fountain! Get out of the fountain!"
Marge,Just stand still and I'll get someone!
Marge,"Young lady, you will never babysit again! I am so disappointed -ointed... - ointed... -ointed..."
Marge,"Oh, I do. I'm just a little concerned about the kids. Maybe I should call."
Marge,"His arm! Oh, my special little guy, are you okay?!"
Marge,"Parades just bring out so many emotions in me: joy, excitement, looking..."
Marge,"Oh, Bart, we've bought those before and you always just throw them out the car window on the ride home."
Marge,No! No more drinking! I'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother.
Marge,All right.
Marge,"What happened to you, Homer? And what have you done to the car?"
Marge,I don't think it had broken axles before.
Marge,That's funny... I used to be able to go down there.
Marge,Why do you have so many bowling balls?
Marge,Beer!
Marge,"You're the one the papers have been talking about. That mysterious ""Beer Baron"" who's been supplying Springfield with alcohol! How have you been getting away with this?"
Marge,"Homer, that's very clever!"
Marge,"Well, it is. I've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done. Besides, he's only breaking a silly, two-hundred-year-old law..."
Marge,Whooh...
Marge,What on earth happened down there?
Marge,"Homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. Your homemade liquor is exploding again."
Marge,"You've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. Why not quit now, while you're ahead?"
Marge,"That was a very sweet thing you did for poor Wiggum, but what's going to happen to you?"
Marge,"Wait! Wait! You can't do this! All my husband did was violate a law that doesn't make sense. Now, I'll admit car crashes and fist fights have been down recently, but prohibition has cost us our freedom. Our freedom to drink."
Marge,Krabappel?
Marge,"Oh, my goodness."
Marge,"Homer, Bart's up there!"
Marge,"Bills... bills... oo, a free sample of gasoline... a note from Publishers' Clearinghouse saying we're out of the running... oh look, Lisa! You got something."
Marge,"Homer, this is yours."
Marge,"I'm sorry, honey. Here, you can have the junk mail."
Marge,"... Bills, bills... Oh a rejection letter from The New Yorker subscription department... Hmm. Who or what is ""Santos L. Halper?"""
Marge,"Oh, Bart, you didn't have to do that. Oh!"
Marge,"Bart, where did you get all this stuff?"
Marge,A frying pan radio. Wow!
Marge,"Oh, he's so smart!"
Marge,"That's Laddie. Bart says he won him at a church carnival, two towns over."
Marge,"""Some call it the dog that never sleeps, though it actually does -- while jogging."""
Marge,"Oh, it's against the house rule... Oh, I guess just this once."
Marge,"Homer, are you wearing a tie to impress Laddie?"
Marge,"Well, we wrecked the first dog. We've got to treat this one right. Bart, why don't you take Laddie for another walk."
Marge,"Besides, he's happy just hanging around the house with Bart."
Marge,"Oh, Maggie, you got oatmeal all over. Homer, would you clean her off?"
Marge,"What's the matter, Bart? Weren't you happy with him?"
Marge,"Well, if that's what you think is best, let's just go down to the kennel and get Santa's Little Helper back."
Marge,"Lisa, what in the heck are you doing?"
Marge,"Well, I think it's a great idea."
Marge,"Well, I'm sorry!"
Marge,"Homer, you didn't tell me Mr. Burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant."
Marge,You told me about that candy bar you found three times!
Marge,"They're not going to close the plant, are they?"
Marge,"Wow, he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking."
Marge,"Yeah, he's broke!"
Marge,"Lisa, nobody likes a gloater. Right, Homie?"
Marge,See!
Marge,"Lisa, you do whatever your conscience tells you."
Marge,"You did the right thing, sweetheart."
Marge,Oh my goodness. Kids! Homer! We're late for church! I'm glad I dressed last night.
Marge,"Homer, the Lord only asks for an hour a week."
Marge,"Hey, calm down. You're wrinkling your church clothes!"
Marge,Church shouldn't be a chore. It should help you in your daily life.
Marge,The dump?
Marge,"No, no, I don't feel like going to a trash pile today."
Marge,It's crazy!
Marge,"...sermons about ""constancy"" and ""prudissitude"" are all very well and good, but the church could be doing so much more to reach out to people."
Marge,Well... okay. I will volunteer!
Marge,"All done! I swept the aisles and put all the collection plates in the dishwasher. Oh, and you wouldn't believe how many dead pigeons there were in the organ."
Marge,Wow.
Marge,"Reverend, I hate to say this, but it sounded like that poor man was reaching out to you. I'm not sure your advice was all that helpful."
Marge,But you can't let a few bad experiences sour you on helping people!
Marge,Me?
Marge,"No, I... I... Wait, I can't... I-- Hello...?"
Marge,"Oh, well, this is... um... the, uh... the Listen Lady!"
Marge,"Okay, uh, why don't you start from the top?"
Marge,"Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe. You've got lots to live for."
Marge,I don't know... guilt?
Marge,"Well, I think volunteering is great. Deep down it makes you feel --"
Marge,Homer! Will you get that crazy box off the dinner table? It came from the dump.
Marge,That's ridiculous. Nobody is watching us right now.
Marge,"Oh, Lenny, I'm sure he'll like your wife no matter what she looks like."
Marge,"Oh. Well, it's time to start telling the truth. Now, when I have to tell my husband the truth, I cook him a big delicious dinner. By the time he's done eating, he's too full and tired to care what I have to say."
Marge,"Please, one at a time, one at a time! Now, who has the most urgent problem?"
Marge,"Come right this way, Mel. I... Tim, hold my calls."
Marge,"Hello, Listen Lady."
Marge,"We all need a little time to ourselves, Helen. Just give him a day or two and I'm sure he'll be back to his old dynamic self."
Marge,You've just got to accept it. Your GameBoy is gone. It's at the bottom of the ocean.
Marge,Hello. Listen Lady.
Marge,"Well, Ned, you don't have to stand for that. You just march right up to those youngsters and tell them to vamoose."
Marge,Hello. Listen Lady.
Marge,"Now, Ned, troubled boys need rules and discipline. They crave it! You just lay down the law."
Marge,"Oh, all right, let me talk to them. Put me on with the lead boy."
Marge,Hmmm. Oh well.
Marge,"Oh, good morning, Maude."
Marge,Of course he did.
Marge,Oh my God... Ned!
Marge,"Reverend, I gave Ned Flanders some bad advice. Now he could be in real trouble."
Marge,"No, he's disappeared. Oh, I'm in way over my head. I mean, where do the helpers turn when they need help?"
Marge,Sorry.
Marge,Ned! Where are you?!
Marge,Donny's discount gas!
Marge,Donny!
Marge,Did you see a man being chased by some young hooligans?
Marge,"Swipe at the dominant male! C'mon, Ned, knock that monkey down!"
Marge,You've got to get him out of there!
Marge,Thank heavens!
Marge,They started it!
Marge,"""MARGE"" is already taken? Oh, how about ""MARJORIE""?"
Marge,"How about...""MITZI""?"
Marge,"Hmmm... ""NITZI""..."
Marge,I only have five lobsters. Are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?
Marge,"Calm down, Homer. Calm down. Answer the door."
Marge,Hello.
Marge,Homer...
Marge,"Homer, why aren't you at work?"
Marge,"You're afraid to go to work because Frank Grimes will be there, aren't you?"
Marge,"You'll have to face him sometime. And when you do, I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are."
Marge,He doesn't hate you. He just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.
Marge,"Well, maybe... but I'll bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more... professional in your work."
Marge,Just a little more... Then he won't have any reason to resent you.
Marge,"I wouldn't bother him, honey. He's making some kind of model for a contest. He says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand."
Marge,"Hello, dear. How was work at the plant?"
Marge,REMEMBER ME? MY NAME IS MARGE! / THE TV MOM WHOSE HAIR IS LARGE!
Marge,Ghost? What ghost?
Marge,I said we were having a special guest tonight -- Mr. Tim Conway.
Marge,"You know Homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show."
Marge,Yes! And it might look something like this...
Marge,I know. And I made your favorite --
Marge,Stakes!
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"In a minute, Homie. I have to get the door."
Marge,"Inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities... how are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world?"
Marge,Christian love?
Marge,But don't you want to end world famine?
Marge,Or save the endangered Alaskan salmon?
Marge,"Well, if you won't think of society's ills..."
Marge,At least think of our dentist bills!
Marge,"Well, it's time to say ""good night."""
Marge,"He's just kidding. We'd like to thank FOX, and the good people at Budget Lodge."
Marge,We're like this all the time!
Marge,I certainly hope so! That's better.
Marge,"Now, about your punishment, young man."
Marge,"I tell you, Chief, I just don't know what we're going to do with him."
Marge,No! No drugs. Bart just needs a little discipline.
Marge,"You know, maybe Chief Wiggum is right. Military school is a good idea."
Marge,"Well, it certainly was nice of you to accept Bart in the middle of the semester."
Marge,"Well, he sure sucked the fun out of that poem."
Marge,"Lisa, no! This place is just a jail for children."
Marge,"Lisa, if you ever want to quit and come home, I'll be here in half a jiff."
Marge,"Oh, honey... I heard you the first time."
Marge,"...and don't worry, sweetie, it's very common to be homesick when you're so far away from the people who love you."
Marge,"""YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE, MY ONLY SUNSHINE / YOU MAKE ME HAPPY, WHEN SKIES ARE GRAY / YOU'LL NEVER KNOW, DEAR / HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU / SO DON'T TAKE MY SUNSHINE AWAY..."""
Marge,"Well, he's got more confidence!"
Marge,"Homer, I don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself."
Marge,"Sorry, sorry."
Marge,Why not?
Marge,"Oh, Homer. Of course you'll have a bad impression of New York if you only focus on the pimps and the CHUDs."
Marge,Great! We're all going to New York!
Marge,"Wake up, everyone. We're almost there."
Marge,"Homer! Homer, those legs belong to the man behind you."
Marge,Wow! I feel like such a nobody.
Marge,It's wall-to-wall landmarks -- the Williamsburg Bridge! Fourth Avenue! Governor's Island!
Marge,"Homer, you're scaring the children."
Marge,The bus station is just one of the sights we came to see. We'll meet you in Central Park at five o'clock.
Marge,"Wow, Governor's Island looks so insignificant from up here."
Marge,"I'm so glad we took the subway. ""Laser Wart Removal"". Wow, the future is here!"
Marge,Are we still in Little Italy?
Marge,Only in New York!
Marge,"No. No Lisa, they're just... sleeping. Upside down. And inside out."
Marge,"Bart, no fireworks! Put that back!"
Marge,If only I didn't already have a pair of shoes.
Marge,"Stay where I can see you, honey..."
Marge,"You know, when I was a girl, I always dreamed of being in a Broadway audience."
Marge,You better start saving now. It's very expensive.
Marge,I hope your father had as much fun as we did.
Marge,"We're not jumping, Homer."
Marge,Bart? Why are you doing that?
Marge,"Uh huh, that explains the flags. What about the dog food?"
Marge,Let's bake him a cake.
Marge,That's not a funny story.
Marge,"Not to us you're not. I mean, how would you feel if you suddenly found out Ned Flanders was an impostor?"
Marge,My next-door neighbor? Religious guy?
Marge,"No I don't! What I mean is, to me you're just a stranger pretending to be something he's not."
Marge,"I'm sorry, but that's just how I feel."
Marge,I'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for Valentine's Day. I'd rather have candy.
Marge,"Good morning, Agnes. How's your new son working out?"
Marge,And have ten items or less.
Marge,"Oh, now be fair, Edna. I liked Armin Tamzarian too, but he was at least as big a weenie as Sgt. Skinner."
Marge,Did you ever tell him that?
Marge,I came up with the idea.
Marge,Because the streets of Capitol City are no place for three unescorted ladies.
Marge,Because we couldn't find Grampa to sit for them.
Marge,MOVIES JOHN TRAVOLTA MADE...
Marge,THOSE WERE THE DAYS.
Marge,AND YOU KNEW WHERE YOU WERE THEN...
Marge,COMING OUT OF MY EIGHT-TRACK...
Marge,MICHAEL JACKSON STILL WAS BLACK...
Marge,THOSE WERE THE DAYS.
Marge,"Oh, honey, I can't right now. Bart's gonna be late!"
Marge,"Ooh, there's the bus. Goodbye, sweetheart!"
Marge,Hi honey! How was your first day of school? Honey?
Marge,IT'S A SHAME WHAT SCHOOL CAN DO.
Marge,"Homer, I can't get the baby to burp. Could you try for a while?"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Sure, honey. Bart had just completed his first day at school. And Bart just..."
Marge,"Sorry, Lisa. It's just how the story goes. No matter what Bart tried, he just couldn't fit in at school."
Marge,"Bart, would you like to read a book?"
Marge,Would you like to color something?
Marge,"Homer, I want you to look at this drawing Bart did."
Marge,Homer stop! Would you please look at the drawing?
Marge,I think we're going to have to get Bart some help.
Marge,"With nowhere else to turn, we went to see the school psychologist..."
Marge,Bart's gay?
Marge,"That's wonderful! But still, can't you do anything for Bart?"
Marge,"Look, I knew private school would be expensive but I was hoping we could get a scholarship of some sort."
Marge,"Come on, honey. I guess this is a world you'll never know."
Marge,And sometimes I feel so smothered by this family I just want to scream till my lungs explode! Uh... I'll go start dinner now.
Marge,"Well, Grampa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that took place when Bart was five and Lisa was three."
Marge,"Yeeesss. Well, as if our troubles weren't bad enough, Springfield was going through an unseasonable heat wave..."
Marge,"Homer, have you seen the frozen peas?"
Marge,"Uhh... you keep 'em. Now listen. If we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage Lisa. Umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the Museum on Saturday..."
Marge,I guess it doesn't matter. All these things cost money and we just don't have it. Unless...
Marge,"Well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner."
Marge,I cannot believe this. I'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit.
Marge,Balzac!
Marge,But Balzac is the name--
Marge,"Please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help Lisa."
Marge,"And so, just as things looked their worst..."
Marge,"Grampa, what are you talking about?"
Marge,"As I was saying, things couldn't be worse for Lisa or Bart..."
Marge,"What ""origin""? We get 'em for a dollar ninety-five down at the Safeway."
Marge,"You know, Homer... I think we have some money in the air conditioner account again, hmmm?"
Marge,You're a good father.
Marge,"Homer, you know how unpredictable the French are. One minute they're kissing a woman's hand, the next they're chopping off her head. What if they start a war?"
Marge,"Homie, is that you?"
Marge,"That sounds beautiful, Ned. And let me just say, my family and I share your vision for a better NOW!"
Marge,"Friends with mutants, right."
Marge,"Homer, no!"
Marge,What's going on down there? What's all this mist?
Marge,"Oh, well, he may be a horrible freak, but he's still my son. I'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time."
Marge,"Homer, stop that!"
Marge,"Ohh, you want more syrup, honey?"
Marge,"Mm! Shoo! Shoo, fly!"
Marge,They're like this every rainy day.
Marge,"Homer, what are you doing?"
Marge,How horrible.
Marge,"Let's come to our senses, everyone. This witch hunt is turning into a circus."
Marge,This is crazy! I'm not a witch!
Marge,What?!
Marge,"That's right, I'm a witch! And I'm the one who withered your livestock, soured your sheeps' milk and made your shirts itchy."
Marge,"No, that was gophers."
Marge,Not all of them...
Marge,And this is for pushing me off the cliff.
Marge,As for the rest of you...
Marge,What a day! They found out I was a witch so I had to leave my family.
Marge,His name is Homer.
Marge,We're here to eat your kids.
Marge,Candied apple!
Marge,I just wish we hadn't filled up on all those kids before we got to the Flanders'.
Marge,It's hard to believe this used to be an internment camp.
Marge,Homer. We gotta get out of here.
Marge,"Oh my God, Homer! They're right next door!"
Marge,What do you recommend?
Marge,Wouldn't we all suffocate?
Marge,"Homer, we need something to protect this family."
Marge,"Homer, I don't want guns in my house! Don't you remember when Maggie shot Mr. Burns?"
Marge,"No! No one's using this gun. The TV said, you're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder."
Marge,"I'm sorry, Homer. No weapons."
Marge,"Homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts."
Marge,Does anyone know where all my dinner plates went?
Marge,"Homer, I told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table."
Marge,It's the same table!
Marge,"Homer, I think you'd agree that I've put up with a lot in this marriage."
Marge,"But this is the first time since we've been married that I've actually feared for our lives. So I'm asking you, if you really care about me and the children, please, please get rid of the gun."
Marge,I'm a lucky woman.
Marge,Bart!
Marge,You lied to me! You promised to get rid of this gun!
Marge,"How could you?! Of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst... the most despicable..."
Marge,"Until you decide what's more important - your gun or your family - we can't live in the same house. Come on, kids."
Marge,I've left Homer.
Marge,So we need a place to spend the night.
Marge,Why can't we stay here?
Marge,No you're not. He's really not.
Marge,"Not right now, dear."
Marge,"Honey, it'll be morning soon. Try and get some sleep."
Marge,Yes.
Marge,"Down here, Homer."
Marge,Come down here.
Marge,What about the gun?
Marge,"Oh, Homie."
Marge,"C'mon, kids. We're goin' home."
Marge,Homer! You said you got rid of the gun. You lied to me! Again!
Marge,How did you know we were being robbed?
Marge,"Now make no mistake. When I say ""first aid,"" I'm not talking about some sort of charity rock concert!"
Marge,I'm talking about treating serious injuries.
Marge,Sounds like you need some first aid.
Marge,"He's going to need a... you know, ""protection."""
Marge,I was thinking more like protection for... down there.
Marge,"I'm talking about his ""personal area."""
Marge,"Look, I want a cup."
Marge,C-U-P! I wanna C-U-... Oh my god!
Marge,"Milhouse, stop that!"
Marge,He's the only coach this team has ever had. And the season hasn't even started yet.
Marge,"You know, Homer, it's very easy to criticize."
Marge,"Ooo, he's quite a little dancer."
Marge,Are you wearing my self-defense whistle?
Marge,You shouldn't pressure Bart like that.
Marge,How can you treat him that way? Don't you remember how bad your father made you feel when you played sports?
Marge,"So like I said, I've never had a tick burrow in so deep. Little guy's just got a mind of his own."
Marge,"Well, at least I'm making conversation."
Marge,"Homer, please."
Marge,He's doing what he thinks is best...
Marge,"Homer, Mr. Burns can't see you winking."
Marge,"Wow, Homer coaching in the championship game. You must be pretty proud of your son."
Marge,Poor Barney.
Marge,"Apu, you're a bachelor. Get up there!"
Marge,"Don't be shy. Uh, Excuse me! Excuse me, we have one more bachelor!"
Marge,"Wellll, look who's the ladies' man..."
Marge,What?!
Marge,What?!
Marge,"How was your day, sweetheart?"
Marge,Hello. So... What brings you to America?
Marge,Ohhhh. Here I am!
Marge,I'm just so honored to have you here in our home.
Marge,"Oh, Bart and Lisa! You remember your father, Apu. Well, this is your father, Apu's mother."
Marge,Right. How much longer is she gonna be here? Homer was a little sketchy on the details.
Marge,"Well, I'm glad you were having fun, because I've had my hands full with Apu's mother."
Marge,"Oh Apu, give it up."
Marge,"I've been looking over this list of things for the ceremony. I've got the extra wine glasses, but I'm still short a tandoori oven, an elephant, and four castrati."
Marge,"I don't know, but I'm sure it's spicy."
Marge,"Thanks for helping us out, Reverend. I know you've never performed a Hindu ceremony..."
Marge,I don't know... there's something very peculiar about this.
Marge,"Ooo, there's that new mega-mall they're building! They say the air conditioner will be more powerful than a million hydrogen bombs."
Marge,The police auction...
Marge,What are you doing with that?
Marge,"Oh, hello, Agnes."
Marge,"Maybe so, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't call them morons."
Marge,"Well... your mother, for one."
Marge,"There has to be more to life than just what we see, Lisa. Everyone needs something to believe in."
Marge,"My poor Lisa. If you can't make a leap of faith now and then, well... I feel sorry for you."
Marge,"Hey, she's gonna smash the angel!"
Marge,What?! She didn't do anything.
Marge,Well... you might say we're going to the best steakhouse in the whole universe.
Marge,"Please, Lisa. I don't know exactly what's gonna happen, but I really wish we could make peace before sunset."
Marge,"Well, I guess you were right, honey. But you have to admit, when that angel started to talk, you were squeezing my hand pretty hard."
Marge,"Any time, my angel."
Marge,"It's Wednesday, Homer."
Marge,Is this all we're going to do today?
Marge,"You know, Homer, I'm starting to realize life is short."
Marge,We have to make the most of the time we have.
Marge,"Otherwise, we could wake up one day and realize we've wasted our whole lives."
Marge,Friends of the Library is holding an historic manuscript viewing.
Marge,Ooo... Oo! There's an Azalea festival at the public garden!
Marge,I'm tired of being cooped up in this house all the time!
Marge,I don't want a drug boat.
Marge,You bought a car?! Without consulting me?!
Marge,I found this hat!
Marge,"Homer, be careful..."
Marge,"Stop, Homer! Stop it! Let me out!"
Marge,I'm not getting back in this car until you drive like a sane person.
Marge,Mr. Hutz! I didn't know you sold real estate.
Marge,Helping people find homes... That must be really rewarding.
Marge,Selling real estate could be just what I'm looking for. I'd really like to give it a try.
Marge,"Oh boy, I've got a lot to learn before that license test."
Marge,"What in the heck is a ""dwelling""?"
Marge,"So, you're married and you're looking for your first house, Mr. and Mrs..."
Marge,"Well, this neighborhood is zoned R-3, which allows dogs, cats, phone-answering monkeys, and, oh... Oh I'll never memorize all this."
Marge,Easement!
Marge,I passed!
Marge,"Oh, thank you Bart, thank you Lisa, for all your help!"
Marge,A headset telephone?! I thought those only existed in the movies!
Marge,For me?
Marge,"Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I'm going to do my darndest to uphold the principles and ideals this jacket represents."
Marge,There it is!
Marge,"I thought so too, but they said it sells."
Marge,"Excuse me, Mr. Szyslak, have you ever considered selling your home?"
Marge,No.
Marge,"And here we have a lovely gourmet kitchen, with gas range, central can-opener, and foam under-flooring for enhanced standability."
Marge,"Why, yes it is..."
Marge,"Yeah, but you shouldn't have to settle. You know, I've always loved the house you're in now."
Marge,My pleasure.
Marge,Do you bowl often?
Marge,"Oh. Well, then you have to ask yourself, is this the right house for you?"
Marge,"Well, like we say, the right house for the right person!"
Marge,But... all I did was tell the truth.
Marge,It's awfully small.
Marge,That's dilapidated.
Marge,That house is on fire.
Marge,That's a beauty.
Marge,"Ooo, I remember. Mrs. Astor was very lucky."
Marge,I thought I'd do anything to succeed in business. But bending the truth... I don't know.
Marge,"So that's how you see me? As a spineless, potato-cooking housewife who can't compete in the real world?"
Marge,"Well, I can too compete. And I'm going to sell a house. End of story."
Marge,"The first house I have to show you is, uhm, a handyman's dream."
Marge,Because it's so dilapidated.
Marge,"Well, there it is..."
Marge,"Some people would call it ""cozy."""
Marge,"But small. Really, really small."
Marge,"Well, that about does it for houses in this area..."
Marge,"I'm sorry, Mr. Hutz, but I just can't lie to people."
Marge,No. There is absolutely nothing else to tell you about this house.
Marge,"No, no. No tricks. It was salesmanship, that's all."
Marge,But it was!
Marge,"Look, just because everyone who lived in that house was hacked to bits, doesn't mean the Flanders will be."
Marge,"Mmmm. Goodbye, Ned. If the slightest thing goes wrong with that house, I want you to call me right away. Or you can beep me. In fact, why don't you just stay here tonight? We'll go to a hotel."
Marge,Hello? Anyone home?
Marge,"Well, I'm just glad you're okay. And I have something to tell you..."
Marge,Mm-hmm.
Marge,Mm-hmm.
Marge,"I'm glad you're not mad, but I lied to you! And I won't feel right until I return your deposit."
Marge,But I...
Marge,"Still, it would have been nice to bring home at least one paycheck."
Marge,$300 for doing nothing?! I feel like such a crook.
Marge,Why do you always wait until Christmas Eve to do your shopping? The crowds are just beastly.
Marge,Homer! Look at this mob! The good toys are probably all gone.
Marge,"Hey, kids, I made your favorite cookies -- Christmas trees for the girls, and bloody spear-heads for Bart."
Marge,"I couldn't agree more. From now on, it's plastic all the way."
Marge,Bart! Put down that yellow sweater! Nobody's going near their presents until 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.
Marge,Seven A.M. No earlier. And you can't set your alarm clocks 'cause I got 'em!
Marge,For once we're gonna celebrate Christmas as a family.
Marge,Homer! I think I heard a noise.
Marge,What happened?
Marge,We were robbed?
Marge,How could somebody...?
Marge,Bart's absolutely right. This is the one day that shouldn't be about material things.
Marge,Looks like the Flanders are having a nice Christmas.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,No. My husband is... at church.
Marge,How do you think I felt?
Marge,Homer! You won't believe what's happened! It's a miracle!
Marge,People saw our story on the news and they've opened their hearts to us!
Marge,"Well, if you mean the money, I suppose we'll just replace the items the burglar took from--"
Marge,"Slow down, Homer."
Marge,Tap the brakes! Tap the brakes!
Marge,That was close.
Marge,"Well, at least the burglar's having a merry Christmas."
Marge,Bart! You're up early.
Marge,What's wrong?
Marge,Stop that!
Marge,"Also, we want to thank the whole town for their generosity."
Marge,So you can see why my husband had to lie to you a moment ago.
Marge,"Oh, Homer. I'm so ashamed."
Marge,"""...You'll all get yours in hell, you lying, thieving, blanking blankers. Sincerely, Moe."""
Marge,"I know you're used to getting hate mail, but I'm not."
Marge,Unless...
Marge,But Mr. Trebek --
Marge,There's no shame in being a pariah.
Marge,"They've forgiven us. It's a miracle! You know, deep down, people are pretty g-- Hey, wait a minute! They're taking our stuff!"
Marge,Good Lord!
Marge,"Look, I know this has been a stressful holiday. But, in a way, having nothing reminds us how lucky we really are."
Marge,We still have each other. And isn't that the best gift of all?
Marge,Stop this madness. It's just a washcloth.
Marge,"Besides, it's mine. Yoink!"
Marge,I'm over here!
Marge,"We got the popcorn! Did you get ""Waiting To Exhale?"""
Marge,What did you get?
Marge,Mm! Who knew that Lee Marvin could do such marvelous splits?
Marge,I thought it was toe-tappin' fun.
Marge,"Homer, you sing all the time!"
Marge,"NOW HOMER, LISTEN, I'VE HAD ENOUGH! / IN OUR FAMILY VIDEOS, WE HAVE PLAINLY SEEN / YOU'RE A SINGING, DANCING, ENTERTAINMENT MACHINE!"
Marge,SURE YOUR DAD'S SINGING / COULD MAKE YOUR HAIR CURL / BUT YOU TOO BART / HAVE SUNG AND DANCED LIKE A GIRL.
Marge,I THINK YOU MOVE LIKE A YOUNG BARYSHNIKOV!
Marge,IT'S A DESPERATE CRIMINAL / ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW / PLEASE SPARE MY CHILDREN!
Marge,"HOMIE, THIS WHOLE TOWN RUNS ON A TUNE! / OUR CHURCHES, OUR CLUBS OUR GOVERNMENT TOO."
Marge,"ACTUALLY, WE'RE DONE."
Marge,"Okay, who wants dinner?"
Marge,"Well, let's get eatin'."
Marge,All right! All right! Sorry!
Marge,Come onnn. You have to go outside to do your... business.
Marge,I'm not going to the bathroom in the backyard.
Marge,Hmf. Why don't you want to go out there?
Marge,The kids were supposed to be keeping this yard clean.
Marge,"Oh, Ned! I'm so sorry!"
Marge,You don't deserve an allowance.
Marge,That backyard is a disgrace. Now get busy.
Marge,You're just going into our backyard. No one will see you.
Marge,Get to work!
Marge,"Kids, I made some lemonade for you."
Marge,What the? What are you doing inside?
Marge,What?!
Marge,"I see. Well then, no chores, no allowance."
Marge,"Well, well, well..."
Marge,Looks like somebody's gonna have to do some yard --
Marge,But when we ask you to do yardwork...
Marge,You can't go on that. You have a heart condition.
Marge,You had a quadruple bypass. You nearly died. Don't you remember?
Marge,But it doesn't look safe. And the guy running it looks a little seedy. No offense.
Marge,It was wearing a hat!
Marge,I don't know.
Marge,Let me get you a coaster for those feet.
Marge,How long are those roustabouts going to be staying here?
Marge,"So Mr. Cooder, how long have you been in the traveling amusement industry?"
Marge,"Aw, aren't you sweet? Hey, my pearls!"
Marge,"Good one, Spud."
Marge,"Ooo, what a nice surprise! This is so generous of you, Cooder."
Marge,The undersea world certainly is full of wonders.
Marge,I wonder how that happened?
Marge,That was fun. I wish we had a glass bottom car. I can't help but wonder what we're missing.
Marge,"Hey, someone's boarded up our windows!"
Marge,What's going on?
Marge,I found some food for breakfast. I hope everyone likes the red things that grow on this tree.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Over the sink! Over the sink!
Marge,Homer!!
Marge,We can't just give up our home. There's gotta be a way to get those guys out of there.
Marge,"We don't want to kill them, Bart. We just want our home back."
Marge,No fires!
Marge,No fires.
Marge,There must be a way to outsmart them.
Marge,"Homer, no!"
Marge,"I'm so proud of you, Homer. You got us our house back."
Marge,Homer...
Marge,I've never heard of these Movementarians. Are they some kind of church?
Marge,But what if they try to talk us into something?
Marge,You bought four of them. Thank God the check bounced.
Marge,You what?!
Marge,You what?!
Marge,We what?
Marge,"I can't go along with this, Homer."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,I'm not leaving my home!
Marge,"When we got married, you promised me my harvesting days were over."
Marge,"This is ridiculous, we're already married!"
Marge,"Homer, you know I always try to put the best face on everything. But there's no face on that damn bean! We hate it here and the family wants to leave."
Marge,"No-o-o-o-o-o-o!!! All righty, time for bed."
Marge,"I'm leaving this place, and you'd better step aside!"
Marge,Reverend Lovejoy! You've got to help me! My entire family has been taken in by the evil Movementarians.
Marge,"Now, how are we going to get my Homie back?"
Marge,"No, no, no. Just the first two."
Marge,"Look, let's the three of us try it together."
Marge,"So, you kids really love the Leader, huh? Even more than your parents?"
Marge,"All right, already! But do you love the Leader more than having your very own, brand new -- Hoverbikes?"
Marge,What do you have to say about the Leader now? Hunh? Hunh?
Marge,And who do you love now?
Marge,Close enough.
Marge,"Sorry kids, there's no such thing as Hoverbikes. They're just a couple of Huffys on a fishing line!"
Marge,"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no! They're due back at the store by six. Get off 'em! Get off, off! Get off!"
Marge,"Willie, I'm not sure we're making any headway here."
Marge,"Hmm... Would you like a tall frosty one, Homer?"
Marge,"Homer, you don't have to go with them!"
Marge,"Homer, come back!"
Marge,That's my husband!
Marge,Omigosh! Maybe he was telling the truth about everything.
Marge,"Ooh, it's so late. You kids have to go to bed."
Marge,"Oh, all right. You can stay up late tonight. But tomorrow everyone's going to bed at five o'clock."
Marge,Oh my goodness! That was a long movie! It's time for school! Let's go! Let's go!
Marge,"Have a great weekend, kids! Be nice to the underprivileged countries."
Marge,"Homer, what are you doing?"
Marge,What business enterprise?
Marge,"Internet, eh?"
Marge,Is that my good butter?
Marge,What exactly is it your company does again?
Marge,How about CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet?
Marge,"Homer, Bill Gates is here."
Marge,"Homer, quiet. You'll queer the deal."
Marge,"Ooo, look! This is a perfect chance to get you kids some nice church shoes."
Marge,"Look, Homer. There's that bird you like to argue with."
Marge,"They need a good, stiff, all-purpose dress shoe. Something for church, but also for doctors appointments dental check-ups, piano recitals, building dedications, visiting elderly relatives, haircuts and shoe shopping."
Marge,Did you hear that kids? Brown!
Marge,Perfect. You'll grow into them.
Marge,"Ooh, you're both way overdue for a spurt."
Marge,"Oh, yes! As long as it's tasteful... And never at someone, or with... And not..."
Marge,Oh good Lord.
Marge,"What'd he say, Lisa? What'd he say?"
Marge,"Ooo, Diego's not gonna like that."
Marge,They have those. They're government listings.
Marge,I've really gotta get dinner started...
Marge,Four drink minimum?
Marge,Here's $42 -- it's everything I have. Run home and bury it in the yard.
Marge,"Oh, knock it off, Homer. You're the fattest one in the car..."
Marge,What on earth -- ?!
Marge,"So, Renee, it looks like you've taken quite a shine to Moe. Do you mind if I ask why?"
Marge,I didn't mean any disrespect. I just can't figure it out.
Marge,"Homer, I insist you steal that car."
Marge,Why all the black?
Marge,"Homer, did you really steal a car?"
Marge,I'd like to believe you...
Marge,"Kids, from now on, I don't want you touching anything in our house. Dart!"
Marge,"Mm, if you'd just apologize to Louie, you could get your hair cut the way you want."
Marge,"Um, you're just having a bad day. I had one last week. I burned the roast, my cake fell, and I ran out of butter so I had to spray the English muffins with PAM."
Marge,I'll go get the Bactine.
Marge,No snacks! Dinner will be ready in three minutes!
Marge,Lisa! Come on! Your tomato soup is getting a skin on top!
Marge,Bart!
Marge,I'm getting worried about Lisa. She's been gone for hours.
Marge,"Homer, your daughter is pouring her heart out!"
Marge,Simpson gene? That's just foolishness.
Marge,"Lisa. Lisa honey, wake up!"
Marge,Because your father has a big surprise for you!
Marge,Better. Come look.
Marge,"Wait a minute, Homer! You didn't ask everybody. What about the women?"
Marge,"Ooo... Did you hear that, Lisa?"
Marge,Unless you're a man.
Marge,It says the ceiling was donated by the Velcro Company.
Marge,...And the floor was donated by American Superball.
Marge,"Come on, Maggie, let's try and find the enormous pendulum."
Marge,Wait there.
Marge,You poor little boy.
Marge,Is that normal?
Marge,Ralph certainly has a lot of imagination.
Marge,Mmmaybe he needs some real friends.
Marge,"Hello, Ralph. When I was little, I used to play by myself, too."
Marge,"Well, thank you, Ralph. You're such a fine young gentleman."
Marge,"All right, all right, now. You're over-stimulated. Let's get some beer in you, and then it's right to bed."
Marge,You know who's nice?
Marge,That Ralph Wiggum boy. He's a real winner.
Marge,"Bart, you don't have to go anywhere today. I've got a surprise for you."
Marge,I scheduled a play date.
Marge,Not hang out. Play date!
Marge,"Now, why don't you show off your new friend around the neighborhood? You two make an adorable pair."
Marge,But...
Marge,"Oh, you mean like the ""A"" students?"
Marge,"He's just a misunderstood little boy who needs a friend. And, if he hangs around with you, well, everyone will think he's cool."
Marge,"Okay, great. You kids have fun."
Marge,"Bart, it's too nice a day to leave Ralph in a closet. You boys should go play outside."
Marge,"Nnno, that stinks. Let me try one."
Marge,"""This is Geraldine, and the devil made me miss your call. So, here come de beep. Here come de beep."""
Marge,"Oh, see, I knew you'd find something you liked about him."
Marge,"Homie, I really don't think this navy thing is a good idea. What if you get called into combat?"
Marge,We don't have a Clapper.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Permission granted.
Marge,"I'm so proud of you, Homie."
Marge,What on earth possessed you to get an earring?
Marge,If Milhouse jumped off a cliff--
Marge,Are you sure you'll be okay?
Marge,Oh my God!
Marge,A dishonorable discharge! It's the best we could've hoped for.
Marge,I put the tax forms on top of your to do pile a month ago!
Marge,"Homer, you know we don't have..."
Marge,"Homer, I painted that for you."
Marge,"You really had a lot of talent, kid."
Marge,They want you to spy on your friends?
Marge,"No! No, Bart! That money's going toward your college education."
Marge,"Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. All your hard work and grade grubbing have finally paid off!"
Marge,"Oh, let your brother do sports."
Marge,"That ""Mom"" stuff doesn't work on me."
Marge,Monkey! There's a monkey in the house!
Marge,Why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey?
Marge,"Honey, I'd love to reassure you, but right now Mommy needs a tetanus shot."
Marge,Hmf. The monkey's on my part of the sofa.
Marge,You already have a monkey.
Marge,No!
Marge,"Oh my, look at all these letters from people who want to be Bart's People, Bart."
Marge,"I'm proud of you, honey. You're finally giving something back to the community, after taking so, so much."
Marge,"Lisa, please. You have absolutely no reason to be jealous. You're still a very important part of Bart's show."
Marge,"Oh, for Pete sakes. Why is that monkey wearing a diaper? I thought he was housebroken."
Marge,"You said this monkey would be sweeping the floors and cleaning the gutters. And now he just lies there, struggling to breathe."
Marge,I want you to take that monkey back so he can be rehabilitated and get a second chance.
Marge,"Happy Love Day, everyone!"
Marge,"For you, Homie."
Marge,"It's the same basic bear, Homey."
Marge,"It's a ""Kisses-Make-Me-Boogie-O-Lantern."""
Marge,Kiss it and make it boogie!
Marge,"Well, we'd better start our Love Day clean-up. You kids take care of the wrapping paper. I'm going to dismantle Love Land."
Marge,I heard that! You know the rule.
Marge,And the school nurse says Bart has the plague.
Marge,Oh lord! Now what are we going to do? Just let the trash pile up?
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"Three, two, one..."
Marge,Go! Go! Go!
Marge,"Homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again."
Marge,"Homer, this has gone far enough. Will you please just apologize to the garbage men?"
Marge,"Oh Homer, you didn't beat City Hall! They picked up our trash because I wrote a letter of apology to the Sanitation Commissioner and signed your name. Period."
Marge,You've signed my name lots of times.
Marge,"I'm really proud of you, Homie, but can the garbage man really do all the things you said?"
Marge,WHO CAN TAKE THIS DIAPER?
Marge,How could you spend four point six million dollars in a month?
Marge,"I'll have to say drugs, too."
Marge,"Good God, Homer! You're turning our wonderful little town into America's trash-hole."
Marge,I can't believe it's come to this.
Marge,Moving the whole town five miles down the road! It's crazy!
Marge,That's what I call break-neck speed.
Marge,"Anyway, it's time for the church picnic."
Marge,No they didn't. You just brought a bucket of chicken to church.
Marge,Me? I'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.
Marge,"Whatever you say, sweetie."
Marge,"Okay, honey. Okay. I'll start taking in all your slacks."
Marge,And your shirt!
Marge,Oh my goodness gracious!
Marge,My casserole is not filth. Eat it.
Marge,Now that's just non--
Marge,"Homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth. Food. I mean, food."
Marge,Has anyone mentioned that Homer doesn't know anything about mountain climbing and that this is all crazy?
Marge,"Don't worry, kids. Your father'll be okay, as long as he's with those Sherpas."
Marge,"Oh no, he fell! I can't look!"
Marge,"Oh, Homie! You're alive!"
Marge,Is that your wallet?
Marge,"Just let me put some film in the camera, and then we'll hop in the car. You can get a picture of your Mommy with a mummy."
Marge,"Whoops! There goes Carlsbad Caverns. Oh, well."
Marge,Bart! What have I told you about throwing money away at that joke shop?
Marge,Take those silly things off.
Marge,"""In case of accidental ingestion, consult a mortician."" Oh my goodness!"
Marge,We've got to get you to a doctor right away.
Marge,"I know, honey. But this is a very unusual situation... at least it would be for most families."
Marge,"A bus? Alone? Absolutely not. It's just too dangerous for an eight-year- old. In a few years, when you're old enough to drive, then you can take A bus."
Marge,"See, Bart? There's another boy who played with glue."
Marge,That's the kind of faucet I want for your bathroom.
Marge,"Can you help him, Doctor?"
Marge,What happened? You didn't do anything.
Marge,"Homer, what's going on? Shouldn't you be at work?"
Marge,But--
Marge,"Oh, sorry."
Marge,"Lisa, we're home! Sorry about the museum! You'd better go up and apologize."
Marge,Do it!
Marge,"Stop it, Lisa!"
Marge,And look as handsome as the day we were married.
Marge,You mean Frank Grimes?
Marge,What are you doing?!
Marge,What happened to Grampa? He was supposed to baby-sit.
Marge,"Hm, I guess we'll have to take the kids with us to dinner."
Marge,"Well, maybe our next anniversary will be more romantic."
Marge,"Ohhh, look, Homie. Our wedding cake."
Marge,"Look at this little plastic couple. Mmm, so full of hopes, potential, dreams for the future..."
Marge,I'm going to bed.
Marge,"Good night, Homie."
Marge,"Yeah, we probably should... you know... rock the Casbah."
Marge,"Oh. Oh, did you want me to...?"
Marge,"No, no, no, I have my part in this, too, um..."
Marge,"Homie, you got your, your elbow in..."
Marge,Mmm.
Marge,Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Do you want me to?
Marge,"Well, we used to..."
Marge,Ooh! Who's a good boy?
Marge,Oh yes he is! Yes he is!
Marge,"Oh, yeah. He's really special."
Marge,"I love him, too. G'night."
Marge,"Homer, don't look."
Marge,"When we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our Saturdays? Driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator motor?"
Marge,Ooh. There's the turn!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Hope that farmhouse has a phone.
Marge,"Quick, the barn!"
Marge,Safe at last.
Marge,Very close...
Marge,Ohhh. My hero.
Marge,"Well, let's just say the country air did us good."
Marge,"Oh, knock it off, you perverts."
Marge,"Oh, isn't it romantic? Doilies and cozies as far as the eye can see."
Marge,Big enough for two...
Marge,Should we get started?
Marge,"Hm, something's not right. Does this bed feel lumpy to you?"
Marge,"What's wrong with us, Homer? Have we lost the spark already?"
Marge,"Heyyy, look at that."
Marge,"Oh, my heart's beating like crazy."
Marge,"Y'know, the fear of getting caught is kind of a turn-on."
Marge,Shh! They'll hear us.
Marge,It's okay when you're in love. And married. To the sweetest guy in the world.
Marge,"You don't think there's anything wrong with what we're doing, do you?"
Marge,"Oh, this is so naughty. Coming back to our old love nest..."
Marge,"Oh, we drank so much that night."
Marge,"Heh, heh. Yeah."
Marge,"Homer, a hand!"
Marge,We're trapped!
Marge,We have to get out of here!
Marge,We've gotta get home before someone sees us.
Marge,But think of the scandal.
Marge,Got 'em.
Marge,Clothes! We're saved!
Marge,Just grab 'em!
Marge,You mean this thing?
Marge,"Hang on, Homie. I'm gonna try to set her down."
Marge,"Wow, a lot of people have pools."
Marge,"Okay, okay. Here we go."
Marge,"Oh, it would have to be Camera Day."
Marge,I don't want you reading those awful scandal sheets.
Marge,"Kids, I want to explain about the stadium. Y'see, sometimes Moms and Dads get a little... well, accustomed to each other."
Marge,So they need to explore new ways to express their love.
Marge,"All those eyes, just leering and leering at us."
Marge,I am!
Marge,All you're getting is rubber bands and paper clips? Don't you need a notebook or something?
Marge,"Homer, that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight."
Marge,With cans of grease?
Marge,"I'm sure they didn't ""ditch"" you, honey. Maybe they went off to plan a surprise party for you."
Marge,My poor Homie. Couldn't you try some other far-out money-making scheme?
Marge,You could raise some emus...
Marge,Lisa...
Marge,"I made you some homemade Pepsi for the dance. It's a little thick, but the price is right."
Marge,"Ohh, so you don't have a date. You can still go and have a wonderful time."
Marge,"Oh, honey. A baby couldn't have organized a big school dance. Unless it was especially skilled. Or one of those super-babies from Brazil."
Marge,"But they're counting on you to take tickets. And if you sit there with a brave little smile and a festive bow, why, you could be the belle of the ball."
Marge,"I have to, honey. Or... you can stay here and we'll have our own dance. ""Every Simpson dance now! Bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp!"""
Marge,"Oh, honey, don't eat that. Wouldn't you rather have your sugar bag?"
Marge,"Okay, but you've accomplished a lot. You've made me very happy."
Marge,You're thirty-nine.
Marge,The kids and I want to show you all the great things you've done.
Marge,"Well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children."
Marge,"That doesn't sound like me. Well, I suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant."
Marge,"All right, already! Everyone knows the man accomplished a lot. Maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about Thomas Edison!"
Marge,"Well, you're not Thomas Edison."
Marge,Whatever.
Marge,I didn't tell you to quit your job.
Marge,Something electrical might be good.
Marge,Oh?
Marge,"Homer, that's not a table, that's our dryer."
Marge,Homer! You can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea.
Marge,What happened? You didn't fall.
Marge,"Hm. I brought you a tuna sandwich. They say it's brain food. I guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are."
Marge,"Turn it off, Homer."
Marge,That's every woman's nightmare.
Marge,"Homer, you've got it set on ""Whore."""
Marge,"No, Bart. Homer... all these inventions, they're..."
Marge,They're not very...
Marge,They're terrible.
Marge,"I'm not saying you're a bad inventor. I'm just saying these particular inventions are awful, and no one in their right mind would buy them. Or accept them as gifts."
Marge,"Oh, dear. I hope I wasn't too rough on him."
Marge,It could save lives!
Marge,I'd buy one.
Marge,"Oh, I just mopped that driveway."
Marge,That was your idea!
Marge,That's me!
Marge,"Hey, listen to this!"
Marge,Congratulations. Your child or children have been selected to appear in Who's Who Among American Elementary School Students.
Marge,Please submit their names along with ninety-five dollars for each handsome volume you wish to order.
Marge,"Oh, I've never been so proud. You both deserve a big, big reward!"
Marge,Are you sure? I can usually smell a scam from two towns over.
Marge,One reward coming up. Ta-da!
Marge,Slow and steady wins the race.
Marge,"Easy, easy. Stick with the plan."
Marge,"That was no accident! Shame on you, Nelson."
Marge,"Oh, no you won't."
Marge,You stay away from Nelson Muntz.
Marge,"Nelson's a troubled, lonely, sad little boy. He needs to be isolated from everyone."
Marge,Yes?
Marge,"While I deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?"
Marge,That's your underwear.
Marge,He's up in his room. Bart?
Marge,"We need Bart to help fold your father's underpants. Where is he, anyway?"
Marge,"He didn't go to Nelson's, did he?"
Marge,"Nelson?! I explicitly forbade Bart from playing with that little monster. Ooo, Bart is in deep, deep trouble."
Marge,"Oh, yes. And punish Lisa for lying to us."
Marge,"Young man, you're coming home with me this minute."
Marge,Not you. Bart.
Marge,Killer? Why did he call you killer?
Marge,What are you hiding there?
Marge,What are those cats doing behind you?
Marge,Bart! Did you kill that poor bird?
Marge,"You disobeyed me, snuck over here, and murdered a helpless animal?"
Marge,"What's the point, Bart? I punish and I punish and I punish, but it never sinks in. So you know what? Do what you want. You want to play with little hoodlums? Fine. Have fun killing things."
Marge,Mmm. What do you think he's doing up there?
Marge,Drug lab?!
Marge,"I don't know, and I don't want to know. And I'm going to find out!"
Marge,"Oh, my good, gray extension cord."
Marge,"Bart, stop whatever you're doing and come down here."
Marge,"Oh, I'll come back later."
Marge,How's this for later?!
Marge,Why are you sitting like that? What are you hiding this time?
Marge,Eggs?
Marge,"Ohhh, oh, honey. Oh, come here."
Marge,Oh my goodness! Look!
Marge,Hmm... it's starting to cool down. I'll bake another pie.
Marge,"Actually, it took fifty-three hours."
Marge,I see a foot!
Marge,No kickboxing!
Marge,How vile.
Marge,I'm sure we can work this out. He's just a child. Let me talk to him.
Marge,"Bart, I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Your lizards are banned by federal law."
Marge,Not as hard as you think.
Marge,Run for it.
Marge,"Oh, am I in the way?"
Marge,Sorry. I didn't realize I was in the way.
Marge,"Ooooh-woo! Wow. If your fly weren't open, you'd look just like Roger Moore."
Marge,I can't believe it. That's horrible! Who'll run the Kwik-E-Mart?
Marge,It's almost as if he's killing from beyond the grave.
Marge,"Oh please, Lisa. Everyone's already figured that out."
Marge,"May I remind you that two people are dead? Oh, wait. I just got it."
Marge,"Sorry, but if I let you watch one of these gruesome Halloween cartoons, I'd be a pretty lousy mother."
Marge,Why don't you kids come trick-or-treating with Maggie and me?
Marge,"Oh, Homer, you're not going as a hobo again?"
Marge,"Well, we're leaving. And remember, no Itchy and Scratchy. I better take these batteries just to be sure."
Marge,"Lisa, look out! A skeleton!"
Marge,"Aww, somebody's in love."
Marge,That means you'll have to be neutered.
Marge,Here comes the flying saucer!
Marge,She's teething. Look... her very first baby tooth.
Marge,Oh my God!
Marge,"Homer, do something! The ceiling's not a safe place for a young baby!"
Marge,"It's probably nothing, but we just wanted to be sure."
Marge,"Oh, that's your cure for everything."
Marge,"Oh, Lord. I was hoping this day would never come."
Marge,I guess I've been in denial. Homer... Kang is Maggie's father.
Marge,It all happened about two years ago...
Marge,"There I was, having a great time in the back yard, when without warning, I was abducted by aliens."
Marge,"I absolutely refuse to go along with this. But since I have no choice, I'll take the alley."
Marge,"I tried to resist, but they applied powerful mind confusion techniques."
Marge,Really? That seemed awfully quick.
Marge,"Nothing, nothing."
Marge,"Nine months later, I gave birth to Maggie."
Marge,I am so -ing embarrassed.
Marge,I can't believe it. Jerry Springer didn't solve our conflict.
Marge,"Oh, you couldn't destroy every politician."
Marge,Suckers.
Marge,"Yes, we'll go to the darn lake! Now go back to bed. It's four A.M.!"
Marge,"Well, it looks like the lake is the place to be, huh?"
Marge,"Homer, your spine!"
Marge,Stop calling everyone suckers!
Marge,Tree!
Marge,This is such a secluded area. I wonder who lives in that house?
Marge,Secure.
Marge,"Stay there, honey. We'll come back for you."
Marge,How's he doing?
Marge,It won't go any --
Marge,"Homie, are you okay?"
Marge,"A cell phone? Last Thursday's ""Variety""?"
Marge,"Homer, when did you become a member of P.E.T.A.?"
Marge,But that's not what P.E.T.A. stands--
Marge,"Homer, you haven't touched your food."
Marge,"Ankle? ""Foccacia""? What are you talking about?"
Marge,Hey!
Marge,"Well, it's better than that last Barbra Streisand movie."
Marge,You're joining the Screen Actor's Guild?
Marge,You lied dozens of times on our mortgage application.
Marge,"Homer, excuse yourself."
Marge,"You know, I really don't appreciate being called a narc."
Marge,And that poncho is filthy! Let me dry-clean it for you.
Marge,"That ain't gonna happen, bub."
Marge,Hmf. I think you've had too much strawberry wine.
Marge,"Homer, for God sakes, put your poncho on!"
Marge,We all blame you.
Marge,"Oh, Lord."
Marge,"Uh, it's that pair of Dockers you wanted. 48 waist with the balloon seat, right?"
Marge,"Ooh, does this mean you're going to start showering again?"
Marge,"I know you feel bad about the juice incident, but I'm sure you can make up for it somehow."
Marge,"Doctor, will he be all right?"
Marge,"No, no one's ""going Catholic."" Three children is enough, thank you."
Marge,I feel guilty coming here every Sunday and never actually buying anything.
Marge,"Oh my goodness! Homer, get her out of there!"
Marge,"Oh, we've got to get you home to a warm blanket and a cold compress."
Marge,"Ohh, you don't sound so good. We'd better get you some cold medicine."
Marge,Ohh.
Marge,"Oh, Homie, you made breakfast."
Marge,"Ohh, how are you feeling, sweetie?"
Marge,"Oh my, you're burning up. I'm going to tell the school you're staying home."
Marge,Lisa!
Marge,You don't have anything I want.
Marge,Lisa?
Marge,You shouldn't be watching the Learning Channel. You need to take it easy.
Marge,Why don't you play with one of Bart's video games instead? Hugh Downs says they're the latest craze.
Marge,"Oh, sweetie, you look so much better. Ready to go back to school?"
Marge,"No, no, you just stay put."
Marge,With eight years of scrupulous honesty.
Marge,That's a risk I'm willing to take. So long!
Marge,"Ooh, so plump and juicy. He's gonna boil up nicely."
Marge,"The water's boiling! Quick, chuck him in!"
Marge,Come on! Chuck him in!
Marge,Let's go! In the pot. In the pot.
Marge,He looks like an ordinary... ow! Son of a--!
Marge,"Well, lobster or no lobster, this is still a very special dinner. Ba-da da-da da-daaa!"
Marge,Lisa broke her own record -- by two whole plusses!
Marge,"Oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. By the way, I oiled the hinge on your diary."
Marge,Don't look at me! I wanted to eat him!
Marge,No! We're not sending the lobster away to some snobby boarding school.
Marge,"Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. You got the highest grade in the class."
Marge,The highest grade.
Marge,Who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?
Marge,And 40 percent more rootin' tootin'!
Marge,"It's so sweet of you to take us out like this, Homie. Come on, kids, three cheers for your father! Hip hip--"
Marge,Hip hip--
Marge,Hip hip--
Marge,This should be very educational. I want you kids to pay attention.
Marge,I never realized history was so filthy.
Marge,"Oh, thank heaven."
Marge,That's a keeper!
Marge,You can get drunk when we get home.
Marge,What is it with you and robots?
Marge,Look who's a little cowgirl!
Marge,"Oh, that's cute. Did you get it in the souvenir shop?"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Oh, no!"
Marge,"Well, Doctor Hibbert said you have to build up your strength."
Marge,"Oh, Homer, that was just a beer can with a whistle glued to it."
Marge,"Oh, I know you're scared, Homie. But remember why you're doing this. It's for your father. The man who raised you and nurtured you."
Marge,"Well, giving him a kidney is a wonderful way to show him how you feel."
Marge,"Ohh, anything, sweetheart."
Marge,"Well... I said I'd do it, so I guess I'll have to."
Marge,No.
Marge,No.
Marge,"I'll tell you when you're dead, Grampa."
Marge,Aren't you going to give him the last rites?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Oh, Homie. I'm so glad you're all right."
Marge,"Yes. You've shortened your life significantly, so someone else can have a slight extension of theirs."
Marge,Look out! Behind you!
Marge,I've got Maggie.
Marge,"Homer, I don't think you were listening to what he just--"
Marge,"Oh, for Pete's sake."
Marge,"You know, I really don't care for that code name."
Marge,Nah!
Marge,"I know you're excited about starting your new job, but could you just relax for now?"
Marge,Homer! I don't want you using your new sleeper hold on the children.
Marge,That's not the point. And another thing. I asked you to take out the garbage three days ago and you still haven't--
Marge,Homer!
Marge,You're guarding the mayor tonight? After Fat Tony swore revenge?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Remember how excited we were when this place opened? Then a week later, we just forgot about it."
Marge,Dust!!!
Marge,We'd better stop and get the car washed.
Marge,"You listen to your friends, but you never listen to me."
Marge,"Wow, you can't find this stuff anywhere! Seals and Crofts, Pablo Cruise, Air Supply, Ohhhh, Loggins and Oates! And it's free!"
Marge,No...
Marge,That's it.
Marge,"You mean, you've never splurged and, say, eaten an entire birthday cake, then blamed it on the dog?"
Marge,Now it's Marge's time to shine!
Marge,"You know, Homie, there's so much more two wives could do for you."
Marge,"That's right. Like my mother always said, you've gotta stick it out, even if you picked a loser. To the bitter end."
Marge,But there's only been one pitch!
Marge,"No, of course not!"
Marge,No!
Marge,"Good hustle, kid."
Marge,"But only by two points. And they didn't resort to stealing bases like the other team, so it's kind of a moral victory."
Marge,"Homer, would you please stop talking about the children's graves?"
Marge,What the dilly-yo?
Marge,Sure you do. You have the right to remain silent.
Marge,Yeah.
Marge,Why don't you kids play one of your old board games?
Marge,When was the last time you played Citizenship?
Marge,It's only 5:30.
Marge,"Oh, the hippo's missing..."
Marge,"I'm tired of that show. But I've been hearing good things about ""Talk to the Hand."" Tom Shales says the writing ""snaps, crackles and pops."""
Marge,"Oh, Homer..."
Marge,KIDS! / I CAN NAG AND NAG TILL MY HAIR TURNS BLUE...
Marge,"Yeah, we're scared!"
Marge,I can't believe it passed.
Marge,"You really should have voted, Homer."
Marge,"Oooh, ""Free foot pain analysis?"""
Marge,I guess.
Marge,I'm so happy you're going to the big game. My dream has always been to see the Bolshoi Ballet.
Marge,It's so nice to have a peaceful weekend together.
Marge,"Mm-hm. Hey, why don't we do one of those craft kits Aunt Patty always gives us?"
Marge,"Oooh, how about paint-by-numbers?"
Marge,"Okay... oh, leather craft."
Marge,Mm-hm. What about clay? You got any problem with clay?
Marge,"Well, what are we waiting for?"
Marge,"Oh, honey. That is egg-ceptional."
Marge,Right. Na--
Marge,"Hmm, Lisa, I don't want to alarm you, but I'm not finding any."
Marge,Nothing! I can't believe Vincent Price would lend his name to such a shoddy product.
Marge,Let's call the company.
Marge,"Well, we'll just see. Murray Hill 5-9232..."
Marge,It's Vincent Price! I thought he was dead.
Marge,"Oh, Mister Price, I loved you in The Abominable Doct..."
Marge,"742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield. Oh, hiya, Maude! Come on in."
Marge,Locked.
Marge,It's hard to believe someone that young could have risen to the rank of Admiral.
Marge,"Homer, it's just a coincidence, like that guy named Anthony Michael Hall who stole your car stereo."
Marge,Another person wants to congratulate you for having a famous name.
Marge,No he's not.
Marge,No dating.
Marge,"Your character provides the comic relief. Like... Ohhh... Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now."""
Marge,But her forehead's on fire.
Marge,"Homer, your growing insanity is starting to worry me. Why don't you talk to the producers of the show? Maybe they'll make your character suave again."
Marge,Bart?
Marge,You changed your name without consulting me?
Marge,But this will be so confusing. The mailman won't know what to do. Did you think of the mailman at all before you did this?
Marge,And what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?
Marge,"But I fell in love with Homer Simpson. I don't want to snuggle with ""Max Power."""
Marge,"Oh, Lord."
Marge,When did you start liking Thai food?
Marge,Who's Trent Steel?
Marge,Where'd you meet this Trent Steel? Moe's?
Marge,"Well, I guess your new name is really opening doors for you."
Marge,You are invited to a garden party this Saturday!
Marge,"Wow, look at this place. The house number is spelled out with letters!"
Marge,"Oh look, it's Woody Harrelson."
Marge,"And there's Ed Begley, Jr."
Marge,"Oh, my Lord! I feel like Cinderella."
Marge,"Eh, maybe later."
Marge,Are you sure it's a Federal law that I have to dance with you?
Marge,"Aren't you coming, Ed?"
Marge,I don't know. Remember that New Year's Eve at Lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!
Marge,You can't blame them for having a social conscience.
Marge,Swab? I thought it was a spray.
Marge,"Oh, no!"
Marge,"Well, I'm glad you changed your name back to Homer Simpson."
Marge,G'night.
Marge,To what?
Marge,Chesty LaRue?!
Marge,I don't want to be Chesty LaRue or Busty St. Claire!
Marge,"Goodnight, Homer."
Marge,Let go of those.
Marge,"He's also thankful for your bounty, Lord."
Marge,"Sweet dreams, honey."
Marge,"Of course, honey."
Marge,"Tomorrow?! Well, that's too bad, mister. I'm not gonna bail you out this time."
Marge,"All right, I'll get you the materials. But you're building it."
Marge,"Oh, I'll make the whole thing."
Marge,"You're a lifesaver, Apu. All the other stores are closed."
Marge,"Well, I'm glad you're always here, but isn't it a little rough on your marriage?"
Marge,"Well, when you have a free night, we'd love to have you two over for dinner."
Marge,Annnd... now.
Marge,I didn't turn it on yet.
Marge,What a lovely home!
Marge,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! If anything, your home makes me ashamed of my home!"
Marge,Deal!
Marge,"Mmm, oh, this is delicious. What's in it?"
Marge,And what's in this?
Marge,"Oh, I'm so glad we were able to get together."
Marge,"Oh, yeah, Homer's a real go-getter."
Marge,Eighteen hours? Nobody works that hard.
Marge,"Well, pretty much. Except weekends."
Marge,Maybe we should leave.
Marge,You don't know what they're saying.
Marge,"Oh, I hope we didn't get Apu in too much trouble."
Marge,Oh dear.
Marge,Either put that book down or let me drive.
Marge,Ooo.
Marge,I'd love to look at SculleryWeek -- if you're through with it.
Marge,This is about investment opportunities in Yemen.
Marge,"Oh, that's sweet."
Marge,"Hey, look at this one. It's a poem. From Apu!"
Marge,My darling bride Manjula / I hereby mend my ways / I'll shower you with Valentines / For seven love-filled days!
Marge,The only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower.
Marge,I can't believe it. He covered your whole bed with wildflowers?
Marge,Hmmm... sometimes I find pickle slices in the sheets.
Marge,"Oh... Just once, I'd like a parrot to say that to me."
Marge,"Then the bird sang ""I Love The Night Life""... with clever new lyrics."
Marge,"I do too. But it was sweet. Women really like that sort of thing, Homie."
Marge,"It's not that monkey card I found in the car, is it?"
Marge,"Homer, I've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos."
Marge,You just don't get it.
Marge,"Oh, isn't that sweet."
Marge,"""I Love You... Cactus? Blobby? Upsilon?"" Oh, who am I kidding? Homer would never surprise me like that."
Marge,Homer?
Marge,What in the world?
Marge,"Just when I think I have you figured out, you fall from the sky with roses."
Marge,"Oh, Homie. Oh, they're beautiful."
Marge,"Oh, I'm gonna snuggle your brains out."
Marge,"No, no, as soon as I get over, that lane will stop moving. Erma Bombeck said so, and Dave Barry agrees."
Marge,"Oopsie. Mm, this could take a minute."
Marge,"I don't know... I, I hate to change lanes once I get going... that's really for race car drivers."
Marge,What in blazes?
Marge,You cashed in your 401 to buy that stupid Canyonero. Why can't you drive it?
Marge,I don't think you're gay. I just have to do my grocery shopping. Now please gimme my keys.
Marge,Good lord. How am I supposed to get in this beast?
Marge,"Well, that's a nice feature. Not much headroom, though..."
Marge,"Ooh! Oh, I guess I can drive it for a little while."
Marge,Hang on. The manual says I need to log on to the onboard computer.
Marge,M-A-R-G-E.
Marge,No one has ever asked me that before in my life.
Marge,"Well, that's a first. I've never been able to fit thirty-two grocery bags into one car before."
Marge,"Hmm, I thought it was Sandy Duncan."
Marge,"Oh, crud. And we're so close to the house."
Marge,"Kids, cut it out!"
Marge,"Oh, I don't know... It doesn't seem right."
Marge,Of course not!
Marge,Let's do it.
Marge,"Outta my way, nature!"
Marge,CANYONERO!
Marge,"That's nice, dear!"
Marge,So?
Marge,"Oh, I'll come watch you do nothing after I try out my new high-intensity halogen headlights."
Marge,Nobody will ever cut me off again!
Marge,I'm almost done. And tell Bart to get out of my purse.
Marge,S.U.V. coming through. Open up for Marge. Thank you! Whoaaa! Daylight! C'mon. C'mon.
Marge,"Geez! Try the gas pedal, Gramma. It's right there, next to the brake. Oh, forgodssa-- Go back to New Jersey..."
Marge,C'mon! C'mon! Get that corpse off the road! The streets are for the living!
Marge,"Oh, great. What'd I do?"
Marge,This better be important.
Marge,"Ooo, did I ever. And that herbal anger rinse just washed the rage right out of me."
Marge,No thanks. But thanks.
Marge,"Well, somebody go first."
Marge,"Oh, for crying out loud... I--"
Marge,"Oh, oh, okay, calm down. Just think: what would Curtis E. Bear do?"
Marge,Get out of the way!
Marge,How could they take away my license? It feels like I lost a limb.
Marge,"No, your father drives like an old lady."
Marge,"I'd like to help you, Chief, but my license was revoked. Seems I'm full of rage."
Marge,That's your hat!
Marge,"Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some dust that needs busting."
Marge,"Outta the way! Move it or lose it! Get going, you!"
Marge,Get in! Get in!
Marge,"C'mon, Homer! Jump!"
Marge,"Looks like it's time for Plan B. One, two, three, ""B""!"
Marge,"It's okay, Homie. You can come out now."
Marge,"Thanks for asking. Well, I was watching Dateline and Stone Philips said S.U.V.'s always roll over when you turn sharply, and the gas tanks explode at the drop of a hat."
Marge,Stone Philips again!
Marge,But there's only one way to find out!
Marge,"Wake up, Homer."
Marge,"C'mon, move your butt! You're blocking traffic!"
Marge,"Come on, let's get you inside and scrape the gum out of your hair."
Marge,What?
Marge,You agreed to spend one Saturday a month doing something with the kids.
Marge,Homer...
Marge,She didn't say it yet!
Marge,I don't want a cellular transmitter sticking out of my roof!
Marge,I guess...
Marge,It's just until we pay off Daddy's desecration of a priceless artifact. I thought I'd never have to say that again.
Marge,Maggie?!
Marge,Ooh...
Marge,"Homer, we're picking up cel phone calls over the baby monitor!"
Marge,"Oh, that's not the point. We should report this to an OmniTouch Care-Rep. People's privacy is at stake."
Marge,Show biz is so fascinating.
Marge,"What is it, honey?"
Marge,"Is that somebody you, Homer?"
Marge,"Okay, then you can take Lisa to Dr. Hibbert's."
Marge,This sounds juicy.
Marge,Bad cat! Leave her alone!
Marge,"C'mon, c'mon, I need some gossip, here! Where is everybody? Does this town shut down at 5 o'clock?"
Marge,"Ooh, talk to me, baby."
Marge,Oh my God!
Marge,That was a horrible trick to play on your mother!
Marge,"Hm. Well, I guess we both learned a lesson. But if anybody asks, you hit him."
Marge,Mmm.
Marge,You still haven't told us why Lenny bit you.
Marge,"Ooh, I heard about that place on ""The Red Grocer."""
Marge,"Well, maybe the animals don't mind, honey. They might enjoy being the center of attention."
Marge,You didn't need to knock the food on the floor.
Marge,Ooh-woo. A complimentary basket of hooves.
Marge,"Beef salad, beef on the cob, beef-fried beef, uh... Is there anything on the menu that isn't meat?"
Marge,How clever! The kids' menu's on the beak.
Marge,"Is it safe to eat that much food, Dr. Hibbert?"
Marge,But what if he chokes?
Marge,"Yeah, c'mon Homie!"
Marge,"No, Homer! Don't fill up on bread!"
Marge,"Oh no. Oh, no..."
Marge,"Good-bye, Homer."
Marge,"Oh, all right. Good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip."
Marge,"Lisa, we got another postcard from your father!"
Marge,Wish you were her. How many of these is he going to send me?
Marge,It's not fair. Your father always gets to have such exciting adventures. Maybe it's time we took a walk on the wild side...
Marge,A musical doorbell!
Marge,So many doorbells... I'm in way over my head.
Marge,"Excuse me, mister... Trainee, I'm trying to find a musical doorbell."
Marge,I'm trying to find a particular tune. It's the one that goes like dah-da-dahhh dah-da-dahhh.
Marge,"Yes, that's it! Lisa, you oughta be a doorbell salesman!"
Marge,Just do it.
Marge,The light's on. All systems are ding-dong!
Marge,"Uhp. It's not a toy, Lisa. We'll just have to wait until someone comes."
Marge,Anyone? Anyone at all?
Marge,"If your father was here, there'd be process servers, repo men, and bounty hunters to beat the band."
Marge,Yess!!
Marge,I would have feigned interest.
Marge,Still no visitors! It's time we opened up a can of whup-tushy on this situation. What's the number for Luigi's?
Marge,"This is it, honey. We did it."
Marge,Dammit!
Marge,Ring the bell!
Marge,"No, but if you'll just ring the--"
Marge,"Lisa, no, no, don't! It won't be the--"
Marge,"Ohhh, it's heavenly! ""Why do birds suddenly appear... over there, over here..."""
Marge,"Who cares?! No one could ever get sick of this song. ""Suddenly appear..."""
Marge,"Okay, okay! Let me just get the wire cutters."
Marge,"Oh, your father traded our tools for M&M's again. Ah, the heck with it."
Marge,"I'm really sorry, everybody, but I've tried everything. I'm afraid we're just going to have to learn to live with it."
Marge,"Oh my. Gracias, Señor."
Marge,Oooo. What a beautiful garden. It's almost like paradise.
Marge,"Uh, aren't you hurt?"
Marge,"Uh, I guess."
Marge,"Speaking of ribs, is there any grub around here?"
Marge,"Well, some general-interest magazines would be nice."
Marge,"Oh, thanks."
Marge,"Oh, how cute. Let's call this little guy a ""groundhog..."""
Marge,"Really? Well, what do you call that thing on the branch?"
Marge,But He said it was forbidden.
Marge,Please stop eating that. God's gonna furious.
Marge,"Well, it is a sin to waste food..."
Marge,This could really spice up those pies I've been making...
Marge,"Yes, God."
Marge,"Adam, say something."
Marge,I'm toiling! What does it look like?
Marge,"Well, it's a little late for apologies now."
Marge,"Oooh, that's a tight squeeze."
Marge,"Oh, thank you. Are you okay?"
Marge,"God, you have every right to flick me out too. But before you..."
Marge,"I'm sure God will let us return soon. I mean, how long can He hold a grudge?"
Marge,"Oh, how embarrassing. Oh, we slept right through church."
Marge,"Oh no, it's the Apocalypse. Bart, are you wearing clean underwear?"
Marge,Why aren't we ascending into Heaven?
Marge,"Oh, right. The sins."
Marge,"You know, Homie, a lot of men use their Saturdays to do things around the house, hint, hint."
Marge,I'm serious. You never finished painting the garage.
Marge,And you could at least get that snake out of the piano...
Marge,Yup.
Marge,How's your father's project coming along?
Marge,"Homie, someone's at the door. They want to talk to you about some sort of car accident."
Marge,Is everything okay? I got worried when I didn't hear any shots.
Marge,"You, an artist?"
Marge,"Hmm, I don't know. I studied art for years, but I just don't get this."
Marge,No I'm not. I just can't believe some people are paying hundreds of dollars for something a hillbilly pulled out of the trash.
Marge,"Homie, I'm really happy you sold your sculpture -- but don't you think it may have been a fluke?"
Marge,That's my life you're describing.
Marge,"Here he is. This is where the... ""magic"" happens."
Marge,I'm happy for you. Now g'night.
Marge,"No, Homer, being an artist was my dream. But now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than I have in my whole life."
Marge,"That's sweet, but, well, how would you like it if I, I don't know, entered a belching contest?"
Marge,You don't understand.
Marge,"Well, I guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy."
Marge,"Homer, I know you worked hard, but all of your... things were kind of the same."
Marge,"The point is, great artists are always trying new things, like Michelangelo or Shaquille O'Neal. You just need some inspiration."
Marge,It's so exciting to do something cultural together.
Marge,A Claes Oldenburg. He's a European who defied convention and embraced American popular culture.
Marge,"Now this is a Joseph Turner. In an era when everyone else painted portraits, he broke away by painting the Venetian Canals."
Marge,"And Picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to cubism. By the end of his life, he was just painting crank letters to the editor. They call it his ""angry jerk"" period."
Marge,Any ideas yet?
Marge,Homer... Homer...
Marge,Oh Lord. What now?
Marge,"Oh, that can't be good."
Marge,"Homer, what have you done?"
Marge,I think some people are going to be upset.
Marge,"Well, they're in the business. Real people might not be so understanding."
Marge,"Well, Homer, I have to admit, you created something people really love. You truly are an artist."
Marge,Ohh...
Marge,Yep.
Marge,That's us.
Marge,"Ooh, I don't know. Could be. I need some inspiration."
Marge,"And it's all because of your letter, Lisa."
Marge,"No one's gonna jinx you, Homer. In fact, we're rooting for you."
Marge,"Hey, that's cute."
Marge,Are you talking to me or the beer?
Marge,I'm not thinking that!
Marge,"So, Bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism?"
Marge,Sounds good to me!
Marge,But we lost the Olympics to Shelbyville.
Marge,To who?
Marge,Nothing.
Marge,Are you okay?
Marge,I want you to get rid of these springs.
Marge,Give me my baby!
Marge,I want these springs out of our house today.
Marge,"You're not flushing those springs down our toilet, are you?"
Marge,I don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day like this. When was the last time we went for a good old-fashioned family walk?
Marge,"Oh, come on, let's go for a walk! This family's getting so lazy."
Marge,"Fine. If we're not going for a walk, we'll just talk about our day. I wrote another poem about a duck."
Marge,"We're walking, Homer."
Marge,Forget it. Nobody's riding any...
Marge,"Oh, look! There's the store where I buy my yarn. But you don't want to buy your buttons there."
Marge,Now there's the place you want to buy your buttons.
Marge,And that's where the bookmobile lady used to live!
Marge,"Ooo, looks like something exciting's happening. Well, we'll have to read about it in tomorrow's paper."
Marge,"Well, it's not really on our walking route..."
Marge,Where'd you get that champagne?
Marge,All this commotion just for a store?
Marge,This is so much nicer than the Kwik-E-Mart.
Marge,"Oh, I'm sorry, but... oh, it really is."
Marge,Homer! Don't you think you're spoiling...
Marge,"Oh, how awful."
Marge,"Oh, I don't think Mr. Burns would like that show."
Marge,Run!
Marge,I was really starting to enjoy Ethnic Mismatch Comedy #644. I've never heard so many Viagra jokes in thirty seconds.
Marge,"Mmm-mm. Oh, I can feel the pounds just melting off."
Marge,"Lisa, would you like a penny to throw at your brother?"
Marge,"Young lady, this may be the high point of Bart's life. Cut him some slack."
Marge,"Lisa, did anyone force you to come here today?"
Marge,"Hm. Well, no one's forcing you to stay."
Marge,"Oh! You're not going anywhere, missy."
Marge,"Oh, Homie."
Marge,"Homie? Well, look at you..."
Marge,"Homer, I've never seen this side of you! But I like it..."
Marge,"Wooh, wooh. Look at those silk pillows. It's like the set of some high-class porno film!"
Marge,"Hold on, wha-- That's our basement?"
Marge,It looks so elegant. And all it takes are some lace curtains and a beaded lampshade. You've got to show me exactly what you did.
Marge,"No, you weren't."
Marge,"Lisa, thank God you're okay."
Marge,I guess everyone has a different vision for the perfect world.
Marge,Who's up for some beers?
Marge,We were robbed?!
Marge,We were saving that money for our family vacation. Now we're gonna have to start all over again.
Marge,"Oh Homer, not again."
Marge,"Well, maybe for your wedding!"
Marge,Not if we want that vacation.
Marge,Thirty-three cents? I paid almost double that.
Marge,Eww...
Marge,"Homer, you could've just unscrewed the bottom."
Marge,There is for a Mega-Savings vacation. Chuck Garabedian says you can fly Mega-cheap if you don't care where you go.
Marge,Are you going through our garbage?
Marge,"Hawaii, here we come!"
Marge,"C'mon, Homer! Japan!"
Marge,"Come on, Homer, Japan will be fun. You liked ""Rashomon."""
Marge,Homer!
Marge,I never knew Jim Belushi made so many movies.
Marge,"Homer, you're supposed to slide those doors open."
Marge,"Bart, what are you doing?"
Marge,I'd like to see the Japanese take on the club sandwich. I bet it's smaller and more efficient!
Marge,"Oh my goodness, Homer, those are a hundred and fifty dollars."
Marge,Maybe we should just head back to the hotel.
Marge,"Honey, I know you want to see Japan, but we're down to our last million yen."
Marge,Be careful. We need that money to get home.
Marge,"But Mr. Ambassador, how are we going to get home?"
Marge,Every truck-load of fish we gut brings us 31 cents closer to those tickets home.
Marge,Family Wish Show... Hmmm... That gives me an idea.
Marge,You honor us.
Marge,"No, no, no! We want plane tickets home to Springfield."
Marge,"We'll go with ""OW, THAT HURTS,"" Skip!"
Marge,"Mmm, I don't think that bridge can support much weight."
Marge,Lisa!
Marge,"Oh, I'm afraid this might be the end."
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"Well, that shut me up."
Marge,"Boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier."
Marge,"Hey, we never opened that envelope to see what our gift is."
Marge,"I know, but we didn't."
Marge,Perfect.
Marge,They're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring Mel Gibson!
Marge,Who cares? Mel Gibson!
Marge,Were you or Lenny ever named sexiest man alive?
Marge,"Besides, it's not just his chisled good looks. People magazine says he's a devoted father, goes to church every week, and likes to fix things around the... Homer, let's make love!"
Marge,"Of course, Homey. Aren't you thinking about me?"
Marge,Is Mel Gibson here?
Marge,It's not boring. He's passionate about government.
Marge,Shh!
Marge,"I liked it. It was nice to see a movie where people solved their problems with words, instead of bullets and chasing."
Marge,Will you stop acting so jealous?
Marge,"Um, will you be reading the cards yourself, Mel?"
Marge,Homer doesn't know anything about making movies.
Marge,"Oh, you poor thing..."
Marge,"Hollywood, here we come!"
Marge,"Hollywood, here we are!"
Marge,"Look, they're making a movie! Robert Downey, Jr. is shooting it out with the police!"
Marge,Ooh!
Marge,Ew!
Marge,Eewww!!
Marge,"According to the map, this house is owned by the dog from ""Frasier."" And that's where Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche live."
Marge,"Homer, what are you doing here?"
Marge,It's true. He does.
Marge,"Oh sorry, honey, I used up the last roll on that man I thought was Judge Judy."
Marge,Put it away. Put it away!
Marge,You mean like John Leguizamo?
Marge,"A drug? I know Bart can be rambunctious, but he's not some hyperactive monster."
Marge,I don't want to pump my little boy full of drugs.
Marge,That's amazing! ...And darling.
Marge,How will we get Bart to take these?
Marge,"Homer, we agreed we'd discuss the medication with Bart."
Marge,Tommy Lee...
Marge,"Honey, if you don't want to take the medicine, we won't force you."
Marge,"Yes, I just thought you might love me enough to let me help you."
Marge,It's what I do.
Marge,"Good morning, honey. How's my special little guy?"
Marge,It's not dope! It's something to help you concentrate.
Marge,Bart! Get those oranges out of there.
Marge,Back in the lunches you go.
Marge,"Oh, grow up."
Marge,"""Thank you in advance for a world-class meal. You're an inspiration to our entire organization. Thank you again, Bart."" Ohh, what a lovely gesture!"
Marge,Can you believe it? And he's even tutoring a little Navajo boy.
Marge,Bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and I could have a night out!
Marge,I was thinking of something a little more... adult.
Marge,And then afterwards...
Marge,I think you misheard me.
Marge,I thought you'd like it. And I'm enjoying the friendship between Showgirl and that seamstress.
Marge,I heard about a new bar where men dance with men. Doesn't that sound adorable?
Marge,Is that Lisa?
Marge,Bart? Honey?
Marge,O-kayyy.
Marge,"I understand the electrodes, but why does he have to be on a treadmill?"
Marge,Oh.
Marge,And their beams.
Marge,I think we should take him off the drug.
Marge,Stop him! He's wacked out of his gourd.
Marge,"... And I'm really worried, Chief. There's no telling what he might do."
Marge,"Oh, my little guy's out there in the hot sun without his sombrero."
Marge,I don't think he has diarrhea.
Marge,"Homer, you're supposed to be hunting for Bart!"
Marge,My sweet baby. He must feel so helpless and scared.
Marge,Thank you for stopping the tank.
Marge,"Oh. So, Bart..."
Marge,How about getting out of the tank... huh maybe stopping your rampage? Huh? We could go to Krusty Burger...
Marge,Major League Baseball?
Marge,"Oh honey, I'm so sorry we sent you on that psychotropic hayride."
Marge,"Well, I'm not giving my baby any more dangerous drugs. From now on it's nothing but fresh air, lots of hugs, and good, old-fashioned Ritalin!"
Marge,"You know, Homie, the ""E"" doesn't work on that typewriter."
Marge,"This is so exciting, Homie. Your first restaurant review."
Marge,Who wants pork chops?
Marge,You always liked my pork chops.
Marge,You like Shake and Bake. You used to put it in your coffee.
Marge,"Oh, yeah? What's a palate?"
Marge,"Homie, my women's intuition's acting up. Something bad's going to happen if you go in there."
Marge,Only your father could take a part-time job at a small-town paper and wind up the target of international assassins.
Marge,"I'm having a hard time seeing. Homer, did you remember to put the fog lights in?"
Marge,I better pull over and play it safe.
Marge,Please be a dog.
Marge,"Oh, no!"
Marge,"Oh my God, we killed Ned Flanders!"
Marge,"Oh, it was an accident! An accident!"
Marge,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Marge,Stop winking.
Marge,No more murders.
Marge,No.
Marge,Someone saw us.
Marge,Homer! Stop that!
Marge,Who could be calling at this hour?
Marge,It's impossible. I killed you.
Marge,I better pull over and play it safe.
Marge,"Remember, you're vulnerable to Kryptonite!"
Marge,And eleven with Robert Urich.
Marge,Who's going to clean up all those jets?
Marge,There goes the clothesline.
Marge,I don't want you looting!
Marge,"Oh, all right."
Marge,"Oh, thank you, Homie. A Lady Remington."
Marge,You're pouring hot butter on my leg!
Marge,Love ya lots!
Marge,"Oh my, war is terrible."
Marge,My hero!
Marge,"Thanks, Homer."
Marge,Homer...
Marge,"Oh, Homer, I bet that southern colonel doesn't even show up."
Marge,"Oh, no!"
Marge,I'm afraid so. And his wife's with him.
Marge,Why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?
Marge,"Hello, my husband will be right with you. We're just taking this old Christmas tree to the dump."
Marge,"No, no, no, no, you'll get sap on your duelling blouse."
Marge,"We're fine, Colonel. Good day."
Marge,Looks like you were saved by a Christmas tree.
Marge,Look! It's Jimmy Carter!
Marge,Then why are you driving so fast?
Marge,"Holy moly, we can't stay here. It's full of raccoons."
Marge,I'll repress the rage I'm feeling.
Marge,Maybe it needs more fertilizer.
Marge,"Well, it's probably just a bad growing season."
Marge,"More tumbleweed, Lisa?"
Marge,"It's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?"
Marge,You got that from a movie poster!
Marge,Where'd you get that?
Marge,Is that plutonium on your gums?
Marge,But it's only been one night.
Marge,"Yeah, but didn't Grasshopperus kill Chad Everett?"
Marge,Oh.
Marge,"Oh, honey, give it up."
Marge,"Homer, no!"
Marge,What is it? Carrots? Peas? Maybe it's okra.
Marge,"That's odd. The outside looks like a tomato, but the inside is brown."
Marge,"Well, I'm not crazy about the plutonium or nicotine, but it is very nice to see Bart eating his vegetables."
Marge,Can I interest you in a mincemeat pie? There very...
Marge,"No, but I use only the fre..."
Marge,Don't forget your mincemeat pie!
Marge,Shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer?
Marge,I'm with Lisa. Let's take 'em to the cleaners.
Marge,"Give them the plant, Homer!"
Marge,I've never been so glad to be home.
Marge,It certainly is. Why don't you put down your gun and have a slice?
Marge,"Num num, Maggie. Num num."
Marge,I can't get Maggie to eat. Maybe if you try...
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Hello? Homer? Where are you? You promised you were going to have a tea party with Maggie.
Marge,"Oh no, not Lenny. Not Lenny!"
Marge,"Okay, sure."
Marge,"Kids, turn off the TV. I have some bad news about Lenny."
Marge,"He shouldn't have deceived me, but I'm just so relieved Lenny's okay."
Marge,"Now listen, your father really needs to concentrate. So we'll just stay here and not disturb him."
Marge,"You did it, Homie!"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Are you comparing yourself to our Lord?
Marge,"Ohhh, Homey, is that what's bothering you?"
Marge,Well the one sure cure for the blues is to talk it over with your life partner.
Marge,"Doctor, how could a little baby save a full-grown man from drowning?"
Marge,"These Swedish furniture designers sure have some far-out ideas. I mean, a green table! I wouldn't have thought of that in my wildest dreams."
Marge,"Excuse me, where are your hamper lids?"
Marge,"Oooh, look at all these clever pencil holders."
Marge,You don't want something that overshadows the pencils.
Marge,"How about this ""Pöpli""?"
Marge,How ingenious. The forks are made out of Lego.
Marge,"Say, whatcha got there?"
Marge,Maggie loves baby talk.
Marge,Oh. Sorry. So have you two thought about kids?
Marge,"I enjoyed a brief but memorable stint as ""Sideshow Marge."""
Marge,"Apu, come quick! You're missing the miracle!"
Marge,You have octuplets. It rolls off your tongue and into your heart: octuplets.
Marge,"You know, I saw Apu today. He's really frazzled."
Marge,Apu told me all eight babies have colic. Although he thinks one or two might just be going along with the crowd.
Marge,"Yes, dear. From the nuclear plant."
Marge,"Knock, knock!"
Marge,"I knew you had your hands full with the babies, so I baked you some banana bread."
Marge,"Well, you don't have to be sarcastic."
Marge,Uh... no thanks.
Marge,Maybe you two should get a nanny.
Marge,Ohhhhh.
Marge,"Oh, look at all that Sweet N' Low."
Marge,A fifties-style restaurant.
Marge,"It's not a real car, Grampa."
Marge,It's clever how the names remind you of the fifties and at the same time tell you what there is to eat.
Marge,Dancing!
Marge,"Okay, Daddy-o."
Marge,Wooo!
Marge,"Wow, a fifties nostalgia cafe!"
Marge,Will you turn that engine off?
Marge,You took a picture of me when I was asleep?
Marge,"""Her turn-ons include thievery and liquor. Her turn-offs include underpants, pedestrians, and justice."""
Marge,What in the world?
Marge,"Okay, Meathook, I think he learned his lesson."
Marge,"I think it's great you've chosen to ""crash"" here, but do you have to be so messy?"
Marge,Stop that! If you want some food I'll be happy to make you some breakfast.
Marge,"Thank you, Ramrod."
Marge,All it takes is the right cleanser and a little elbow grease.
Marge,"Just put it on my sewing pile. Okay, I'm doing another load of bandanas!"
Marge,Could you at least tell me what you're planning to do with me?
Marge,None of you? Really? I could have sworn that Ramrod...
Marge,"Hm. Well, did you see that picture of me in..."
Marge,And you still don't...
Marge,"Well, good. I guess."
Marge,Where are we going?
Marge,"You know, there's more to life than boozing and roughhousing."
Marge,Haven't any of you ever had a dream?
Marge,"No, no, I mean the dream of a good job, a loving family, and a home in the suburbs."
Marge,"No, you don't have to kill anyone. Not if you have jobs."
Marge,And the first step is an eye-catching resumé.
Marge,"And when you get a job interview, try not to call your employer a ""punk"" or a ""skank."""
Marge,Broke! You broke your pencil.
Marge,That's right. And what else have we learned?
Marge,"Excellent, Ramrod. Civilized people solve their disputes with words."
Marge,"Homer, stop! No, you don't understand!"
Marge,Talk to him. Use your words.
Marge,"Oh, Homie."
Marge,"Ohh, I just swept the Circle of Death!"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,No!
Marge,Goodbye everybody!
Marge,Why are we stopping here?
Marge,Why are you doing that?
Marge,"Sorry, how long will he take to recover?"
Marge,What will become of our kids?
Marge,"No, they're not. They're terrible, terrible ideas."
Marge,What about Mr. Burns? Maybe he'll help us out.
Marge,"Why don't you kick some books, Lisa?"
Marge,"Boy, that sounds fun."
Marge,"To be fair, not all evil robots are killers."
Marge,"Okay, here goes..."
Marge,"This box? Oh, nothing."
Marge,"Well, anyone would be nervous with all the economic turmoil you read about in the..."
Marge,Go! Go!
Marge,I'll never get rid of this useless junk.
Marge,You guys never use any of this stuff.
Marge,"Look at these. You bought them after the Nagano Olympics, and never skied once. If you would just stop being so impulsive, maybe..."
Marge,This chair lift sure goes high...
Marge,Finally...
Marge,Stop it!
Marge,I'm sorry!
Marge,I think that's an arm rest.
Marge,You mean like a hats and noisemakers kind of party?
Marge,Who's Disco Stu?
Marge,"Hi, pumpkins!"
Marge,Skiing fanny-first into a crevasse isn't my idea of fun. The only risk I'm taking is running out of marshmallows!
Marge,Owww!!
Marge,I can't be in the hospital! Tomorrow is laundry day. And I've gotta de-meat Lisa's baloney.
Marge,"Sweetie, it's nice that you want to take charge around the house, but don't be a hero. Just make sure your father eats all his meals over a tarp. But not the good tarp. I want you to get married on that some day!"
Marge,"Oh, really? Well, knock yourself out. Just don't expect any miracles from those two."
Marge,I couldn't sleep knowing that window had a smudge on it.
Marge,"Oh, I don't want to be a bother."
Marge,So it does.
Marge,"Oh, I don't think I need any... Oh, wow..."
Marge,Talk to me.
Marge,"Leg? Oh, oh, that. It's pretty great. How are things at home?"
Marge,"Oh, I don't know, honey. I've got a lot of therapy left."
Marge,I think so too. Bye!
Marge,"Well, it has been a week."
Marge,"I'm home, everybody! Gee, the house looks great!"
Marge,Lost them? What do you mean?
Marge,"Hansen's Disease. You know, like that horrible cream soda?"
Marge,"Okay, okay calm down. They couldn't have gone too far."
Marge,Molokai?!
Marge,"Oh, thank God you're all right!"
Marge,"Well, then let's get out of here."
Marge,"Well, it all sounds lovely, but..."
Marge,"There's a homecoming parade, a cocktail party..."
Marge,You college boys are only interested in one thing.
Marge,Does anybody need that much porno?
Marge,I tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat but your father kept eating it.
Marge,So he's stuck like this forever?
Marge,"Homer, maybe I should drive."
Marge,Where are we?
Marge,Wow! He should have his foot insured by Lloyds of London!
Marge,He hit the star player!
Marge,"A field goal? Hm... Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one... That would win the game!"
Marge,Will that really work?
Marge,"I don't know, there's a lot of buzz around Lenny."
Marge,"I can't help it if I donated the most blood. Oh, I'm feeling kinda woozy."
Marge,"Homer, sit down."
Marge,"That's not an award, that's part of the set."
Marge,Uh-huh. The Fire Department.
Marge,Don't worry about a thing. We'll take good care of your house!
Marge,Good Lord! This bedroom is as big as our house!
Marge,Seems a little wasteful.
Marge,This all seems a little elaborate for sloppy joes.
Marge,"Hmm, I know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?"
Marge,"Homer, watch your lang... Oooooh. That's a lifesaver."
Marge,"Stop that! Cigars are for rich people and legendary comedians, like Bill Crosby and David Letterson."
Marge,"Homer, did you jimmy open Mr. Burns' liquor cabinet?"
Marge,"Stop swirling, Homer!"
Marge,"Homer, who are you calling?"
Marge,"Well, don't run up Mr. Burns' phone bill."
Marge,"Homer, you've got to stop pretending this is your house. You're not a billionaire."
Marge,All I'm saying is don't get too comfortable. Mr. Burns will be back tomorrow.
Marge,Party? No! No parties.
Marge,"No partays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no mixers, no raves, no box socials..."
Marge,"Oh no, you don't! I'm not going to let you trash Mr. Burns' yacht."
Marge,"Oh, Homie, I don't care if you're a billionaire. I love you just because you're..."
Marge,The boat's going sideways!
Marge,"Honey, we want Mr. Burns to find this place exactly the way he left it."
Marge,"Bart, stop that! Now, we may not have antique furniture, or priceless art work, but we have everything we need right here."
Marge,"Homer, give him the fifty cents."
Marge,I can't wait to do some shopping -- Look at all these innovative products. Miracle Shears...
Marge,"Ooh, the Drain Bugger!"
Marge,"That is the best version of ""Living in America"" I've ever heard."
Marge,"Never, but it's my number one concern!"
Marge,"Homer, Lisa's in that."
Marge,Let's forget about the band contest and just have fun at the State Fair.
Marge,"Yeah, right, that's what I meant, Lisa. State Un-fair."
Marge,I didn't say they couldn't. I said you shouldn't.
Marge,I wish people would stop telling me to step right up.
Marge,Hmm. Should the Simpsons get a horse?
Marge,"Oh, my. Ooh-hoo. It's going to cost us $500 a week to keep Duncan!"
Marge,"At least you don't have to feed any of the stuff I bought at the fair. Well, except the mop."
Marge,"What are you doing, Lisa?"
Marge,"Honey, don't get obsessed with that. Focus on the good things. Like this fire extinguisher I got at the fair."
Marge,It's the only fire extinguisher endorsed by both Lynda Carter and George Foreman.
Marge,I wonder what would happen if they had a baby?
Marge,"Lisa, you've got to learn that life isn't always fair. Try to channel your disappointment into something creative, like a sampler."
Marge,Furious D?
Marge,So many horses. I don't know who to vote for. Can't I just bet that all the horses will have a fun time?
Marge,"Okay, Lisa. I've got Furious D across the board, boxed with the three and the eight, and wheeled up and down."
Marge,President Clinton?!
Marge,That's a pretty lousy lesson.
Marge,They sound angry... and Africanized.
Marge,You're on fire!
Marge,I don't see why not.
Marge,"I do! I do! Wait, no I don't."
Marge,It's hard to believe we're never going to see Maude again.
Marge,"Now Homey, you know, Ned and the boys need us. And you know what that means."
Marge,That's right.
Marge,"Bart? Honey, I think you should go play with Rod and Todd."
Marge,"Now if there's anything, anything at all I can do to help out..."
Marge,"You're darn right you are! And you've got lots of other great qualities, too."
Marge,What floozies? What are you talking...
Marge,I think it is!
Marge,"Glad you made it, Ned."
Marge,"Homer, you help too."
Marge,"They don't show police chases, do they?"
Marge,"From now on, one of us always stays home."
Marge,"So, you said on the phone you had something to tell me?"
Marge,Missionary work?
Marge,Homer? Homer?
Marge,Hello? Is there anybody in there?
Marge,"Homer, are you all right?"
Marge,You've only been gone two days.
Marge,I just don't think it's funny!
Marge,"Oh, yes. The whole town thinks you're a real humanitarian. Ned Flanders is green with envy."
Marge,"Homer, I'm so impressed. Everything you're doing sounds so rewarding."
Marge,Guess who I saw at the supermarket today!
Marge,"I'm sorry, honey. I just thought you..."
Marge,"That's it, Bart. You're taking this man-of-the-house thing too far."
Marge,Hmm. A night out is a night out.
Marge,Don't panic! Don't panic! Don't panic!
Marge,You set off the smoke alarm to rush us to a beer festival?
Marge,I guess I'll be driving.
Marge,Rockin' Fun Zone? That sounds funnn...
Marge,I don't see the need for razor wire.
Marge,When I get home there are gonna be a lot of open pickle jars.
Marge,"Kids, would you like a balloon?"
Marge,"Well, I'm gonna keep watching as long as they have shocking story twists and endless pillow talk."
Marge,Who cares? He's dishin' out the dirt.
Marge,I'm not sure mosquito season is the best time to visit Larva Lake...
Marge,"Homer, you know I had a gambling problem."
Marge,Not half as good as cyberfudge.
Marge,She's President of the United States.
Marge,We're not giving you money.
Marge,"Be nice to your brother, Lisa."
Marge,Don't you think we should wait for Lisa? She is the President.
Marge,Here she is. And look how big she's gotten.
Marge,"Aww, just like her mommy, Maggie Senior. So, what did everyone do today?"
Marge,Oh!
Marge,Wait! How do you know this is where Lincoln buried the gold? You just started counting from an arbitrary place.
Marge,Your plan makes no sense.
Marge,Gold bars discovered by Homer?
Marge,"""Dear Countryman: You have come in search of my gold, and I will not disappoint you."""
Marge,"My gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving American.,my gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving american,10
69808,243,293,Homer Simpson: Ah"
Marge,"It's in our mighty rivers, our majestic..."" Well, isn't that clever? It's a metaphor."
Marge,I don't remember the air in the kitchen being so wavy. Good Lord - that's gas!
Marge,"Homer, you can't just reroute the gas line. Do you know how dangerous that is?"
Marge,"I wrote a poem for Barney on this special occasion. ""Now that you're one year older, the time flew by so fast..."""
Marge,Bart!
Marge,Gimme that!
Marge,You danced for hours just because they told you to?
Marge,Get it away from the house!
Marge,"Yes, go! Just go!"
Marge,So how was your ride with Barney?
Marge,"Cheer up, Homie. You don't need friends to be happy. I haven't had a friend in years."
Marge,"Well, you still have Lenny and Carl."
Marge,"Well, if Barney's that important to you, you've gotta work it out. Old friends stick together, like O.J. and A.C., or the Falcon and the Snowman."
Marge,"Kids, the new phone books are here. And your picture's on the cover!"
Marge,Isn't it adorable? I guess some baby pictures were on that old roll of film.
Marge,"Actually, I took the picture, so I gave my prize to the orphanage."
Marge,Just kidding. I would never do that.
Marge,"Homie, for God's sakes, it's two a.m."
Marge,I don't know. I'm trying to sleep.
Marge,Now what's wrong?
Marge,"Well, maybe you added it wrong. Let me add it..."
Marge,"Oh, honey, don't panic. If you just made a few lifestyle changes..."
Marge,"Maybe you should see a doctor, Homie. A head doctor."
Marge,Aww. He can crawl up through my toilet any day.
Marge,"Quiet, you two! You know your father's had a breakdown."
Marge,"Okay honey, we're almost to Palm Corners. There'll be nothing to do but lie on the beach and relax."
Marge,Take 'em off the glass! Take 'em off the glass!
Marge,This looks like a terrible place to relax. We're gonna get you to a--
Marge,This is terrible. The whole point of coming down here was for you to get some rest.
Marge,Not now.
Marge,"I trust you, honey."
Marge,Sweet dreams.
Marge,Is he a maneater?
Marge,"Oh, thank goodness. Where were you?"
Marge,"I hope he didn't cause too much trouble, Sheriff."
Marge,"Oh, no."
Marge,Did you really have to handcuff the children?
Marge,"You seemed so understanding before. What happened to ""boys will be boys""?"
Marge,Homer no. You'll kill us all.
Marge,You went to the snack car?
Marge,"This family has hit a new low. We're on the run from the law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes... And it's all your fault."
Marge,A diner!?
Marge,"Ohhh, it's so cozy."
Marge,"Can I top you off, hon?"
Marge,Those noxious gasses from the swamp must magnify them.
Marge,And y'all hardly ever bicker anymore.
Marge,"You mean, when they marry other people."
Marge,We'd be much better rock breakers if we weren't all chained together.
Marge,"You know, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
Marge,Owww.
Marge,I'm beginning to dislike the man with the whip.
Marge,"Okay, Bart. I'll sweet-talk the Sheriff, while you grab his keys."
Marge,Restock the possum bar. We're almost out of claws.
Marge,"My goodness, what a lovely suit, Sheriff. Is that seersucker?"
Marge,"Well, the fabric really brings out the red in your neck."
Marge,"Dang, I wish I could. But in August, our chain gang has to dig for tar."
Marge,"Well, we're still welcome in North Dakota and Arizona."
Marge,That's South Dakota.
Marge,"Homer, sitting that close to the TV can't be good for you."
Marge,You should get your eyes checked. I'm taking Bart to the mall to buy camping supplies -- why don't you come along?
Marge,We need something quick. My husband's eyes are really shot.
Marge,"Come on, Bart. While your dad gets his glasses, we'll go shop for your trip."
Marge,"But you need to try things on! Every brand has a different idea of ""Husky."""
Marge,"Fine, you win. I'll do your shopping for you."
Marge,"Well, looks like we got everything for Bart's camping trip: Blair Witch Repellent, antler saw and Deep Woods Scrabble."
Marge,"Ooh, ""Tango de la Muerte."" I've been dying to see that movie!"
Marge,"That's wonderful, honey. We should ask your father, though. Where is he, anyway?"
Marge,I remember Little Vicki Valentine! Her perky smile and dancing brought America right out of the depression.
Marge,"Don't smart mouth, Lisa."
Marge,"Hi, Little Vicki."
Marge,"All right. I'd like to sign my daughter up for lessons, Vicki."
Marge,But you just said that...
Marge,"Ah, Little Vicki, I really think she had her heart set on..."
Marge,Okay.
Marge,Why does it have a picture of Vitamin Barn?
Marge,There's our Broadway Baby!
Marge,"Hey, dig that crazy rhythm."
Marge,And you will be a dancer.
Marge,And you look adorable.
Marge,"Yes, our tiny tapper. What was it you were going to say after ""I wanted to be a dancer, but..."""
Marge,The furnace?
Marge,Awww...
Marge,Where's Lisa?
Marge,"There she is! Hi, honey! Wow, look at her go."
Marge,"Lisa's gone berserk! Do something, Homer! Do something!"
Marge,"See, honey? All you needed was to believe in..."
Marge,Sure. It could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
Marge,"Homer, look, we're invited to Otto's wedding!"
Marge,"Ooh, and such delicate tissue paper. Zig-Zag!?"
Marge,No knife games on the kitchen table!
Marge,"Ooh, we're ""cordially"" invited... this Saturday... to join Otto and Becky at... 742 Evergreen Terrace? That's our address!"
Marge,"You should have asked first, Bart. Weddings are hard work and cost thousands of dollars."
Marge,"All right, Otto can get married here. But Homer, you have to get rid of that elephant."
Marge,"Let's see. Candles, flowers, place cards, rice..."
Marge,"Oh, Becky, you look beautiful. I thought you might want to see this bridal magazine. It's got nine hundred tips for the perfect marriage. All ""don'ts."""
Marge,"Well, the real key, according to sexperts, is mutual interests."
Marge,Mm-hmm?
Marge,"Oh, you can fix little defects like that with gentle nagging. Make it part of the background noise of your relationship. That's how I polished Homer into the perfect... Homer! No, that's ice!"
Marge,Let me talk to Otto.
Marge,"Well, it doesn't have to be. Otto's just going to have to decide what's more important, his heavy metal or you."
Marge,"Becky, what have I done here? I'm so sorry."
Marge,"Becky, I know you must feel awful. But at least this didn't happen after you were married."
Marge,"Bart, remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house?"
Marge,"Now, Lisa's going through this phase where she doesn't eat any meat. So I usually sneak a little meat juice into her vegetables."
Marge,Nobody's ever called my gravy yummers before!
Marge,"Ooo, ooo, I've always wanted to use rosemary in something."
Marge,Thanks to our own spice girl: Becky.
Marge,"Actually, that was Becky, too."
Marge,"Well, nobody's perfect. Let me just pick those out."
Marge,Stop kicking my baby!
Marge,"Well, no kicking. It's too dangerous."
Marge,"That's very impressive, but I still don't... stop that!"
Marge,Hello. HEL-LOOO.
Marge,"Yes. Well, I guess I'll go roll socks. It's not ""hip,"" but it has to be done."
Marge,It's red!
Marge,"Yes, I hate when things get worn out... hmm... socks... welcomes..."
Marge,"...she's so helpful and everyone loves her and, well, this may sound crazy, but I think my family likes Becky more than me."
Marge,Really?
Marge,Dead in a week? What are you talking about?
Marge,That was a movie.
Marge,Becky's going to seduce Homer?
Marge,It is?
Marge,Be right back.
Marge,"Why do I always think of the perfect thing to say when it's too late: ""Shut up, Becky!"" Ooh, that would've been sweet."
Marge,"Oh, no. The ""Brakes Cut"" light."
Marge,Why would I do that?
Marge,That's crazy.
Marge,"Look, I know I don't have any proof, but this woman is trying to kill me!"
Marge,Do I have to be dead before you'll help me?
Marge,Usurper! Usurper! Usurper!
Marge,"Don't mess with me, I've got jimmies!"
Marge,"Shut up, Becky! There. I finally said it."
Marge,I thought you said the law was powerless.
Marge,"This isn't over, Becky. I know where you live: My house!"
Marge,Yes.
Marge,It was healthy. He reciprocated. He reciprocated!
Marge,Oh... I was just praying to God that you'll find me sane.
Marge,"Oh, yes. He's kind of everywhere."
Marge,I'm not insane!
Marge,I'm not insane!
Marge,"Now, let's find out who this Becky really is."
Marge,I really should read the whole headline before I react.
Marge,"Oh, my. I've been so unfair to Becky. Maybe I am insane. I mean, I am talking to myself."
Marge,"Becky, I want to apologize to you...surper!"
Marge,Why you little...!
Marge,Shot? Wha?
Marge,"Oh. Well, then, I guess there's a reasonable explanation for everything. Except you cutting my brakes!"
Marge,"Ooboy, my bad. Becky, I'm so sorry I accused you of trying to kill me and steal my family."
Marge,"Well, that's a relief, too, knowing I'm not crazy. So I guess everything really worked out for the--"
Marge,No they didn't.
Marge,"Oh, I've got too much to do to take a nap right now. Lisa, get Maggie out of that cage. And Homer, since you're dressed for it, I got some S & M for ya: Scrubbing and Mopping."
Marge,"They told us what to wear, how to dress, which clothes we should put on..."
Marge,Nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids. They almost drove me to fortified wine!
Marge,"""The Malarkeys,"" ""Dumbin' It Down""..."
Marge,"Homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show. Finally, I said, ""So, do it! Either shit or get off the pot."""
Marge,I haven't done the laundry yet.
Marge,"Okay, the material was a little corny, but Homer and I had real chemistry onscreen."
Marge,"Fortunately, I had a network connection. The man who cut my hair was also President of Fox."
Marge,We were using fifty-dollar bills as toilet paper. And toilet paper as dog toilet paper.
Marge,... and just a few stars down from the Cheerios Honey Bee.
Marge,"I learned something: When people reach for their diaphragm, they don't want to see my picture."
Marge,"Hey, you've been riding me all day. Why don't you poop in your hat?"
Marge,"Bart, what do you mean, you have jury duty?"
Marge,"Now Homer, this is no time to be thinking about food."
Marge,"Something that swings, with the beat of New Orleans."
Marge,Swings!
Marge,"You don't have the guts, little man!"
Marge,Stop it!
Marge,I SHOT THE SHERIFF / BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEP-U-TY
Marge,"So, the next time you see a sheriff, shoot him..."
Marge,... A smile.
Marge,"Good night, Laughlin!"
Marge,"Oh, save it for your next book, you little snitch!"
Marge,"You just don't say no to the Redheaded Stranger. And when I heard it was for awareness, that sealed the deal."
Marge,... which Homer writes himself.
Marge,I can't believe it. We won another contest!
Marge,I don't like you ogling her.
Marge,"Why don't you read ""Cathy""? She's hilarious."
Marge,What?!
Marge,"Maybe I'd better check mine. ""Today, your husband will die."" Homer, I'm scared."
Marge,No dessert until you eat your broccoli.
Marge,But I thought broccoli was--
Marge,Poor Homie. I still can't believe a piece of broccoli killed you.
Marge,"Homer, it's you!! I thought I'd never see you again."
Marge,Do you have to talk like that?
Marge,"Well, I've got a whole list of chores: clean the garage, paint the house, grout the tu--"
Marge,"Son, I don't like you watching that fire. It's too violent."
Marge,"What?! Oh, why are the oafs always the first to go?"
Marge,"But Husband, without your weekly pittance, how shall we feed our children?"
Marge,What?! You threw our precious babies into the woods?! We could have sold them!
Marge,Go back and get them!
Marge,"Well, we're still poor, but thanks to your father, we'll never go hungry."
Marge,But you seemed so happy in the ocean. All that playful leaping.
Marge,"Geez, so many dolphins..."
Marge,"Oh honey, I wouldn't say doomed. It's gonna be an adjustment, no question..."
Marge,"The phone company ran out of numbers, so they split the city into two area codes. Half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939."
Marge,"Geez, you just have to remember three extra numbers."
Marge,"More wheat cakes, Mr. Mayor?"
Marge,That's not true.
Marge,Out-of-towner Tax?!
Marge,"All right, but this better be the best toilet paper I've ever had."
Marge,"Ooh, why didn't you say so? Hey, is there a bathroom here?"
Marge,"I don't know why, but I just didn't feel comfortable until I was back here in New Springfield, with my own kind."
Marge,They were looking at me. With their eyes.
Marge,We can't go on fighting with Olde Springfield. These people are our neighbors. We see them every day.
Marge,Like the one in Berlin?
Marge,Homer...
Marge,"To be honest, it's a little chilly."
Marge,My experiment? You're the one who came up with this whole idea...
Marge,Don't you two have a list of chores to do?
Marge,"Homer, what are you doing?!"
Marge,"Well, like all Americans, fast."
Marge,"Well, you can't argue with results..."
Marge,"Mmmm, these StigMuffins are to die for!"
Marge,Mmmm.
Marge,"So, Mr. King, what tale of horror and the macabre are you working on now?"
Marge,"Oh, that's too bad."
Marge,"Well, let me know when you get back to horror."
Marge,And you'll lose weight?
Marge,"Look, Maggie. Christopher Walken's reading ""Goodnight Moon!"""
Marge,"Homer, that's not a prayer, that's gossip."
Marge,"Oh, Krusty. I'm sure she just needs time to get used to you."
Marge,"Sure, go ahead."
Marge,"Here's a headline for Jay. ""Ketchup Truck Hits Hamburger Stand."""
Marge,"Oh, I might be able to help you..."
Marge,With a song about thrift!
Marge,WHEN YOU GET A PENNY FROM A CHUM / DON'T JUST BUY SOME BUBBLE GUM! PUT IT IN YOUR CAP! PUT IT IN YOUR CAP! WHEN YOU FIND A NICKEL IN THE SNOW / DON'T JUST BLOW IT ON A PICTURE SHOW PUT IT IN YOUR CAP / PUT IT IN YOUR CAP...
Marge,WHEN YOU SPY A QUARTER IN A PIE...
Marge,"Bart, it's so sweet of you to take the family out to Krustyburger."
Marge,"Oh, how cute! Kids, look who's on the roof!"
Marge,I can't believe how young he is. He'd be cute if he weren't so idealistic.
Marge,"Yeah, that was the boy Lisa likes."
Marge,They've undergone terrible hardships.
Marge,We don't have a stash.
Marge,"Oh, no. My baby's up there!"
Marge,"Now honey, let's turn on the news and forget our troubles."
Marge,"Oh my, they made you a shrine!"
Marge,We have to tell them you're not dead.
Marge,"You are not pretending to be dead, young lady. This family has had nothing but bad luck when it comes to farce."
Marge,"Now that our son is an honor student, I'm going to get one of those bumper stickers that informs strangers of that fact."
Marge,"An ""A"" in astronomy. How'd you do it?"
Marge,"Well, we couldn't be prouder."
Marge,When did this happen? When did we become the bottom rung of society?
Marge,Maybe we should talk to a financial planner.
Marge,"Homie, where did you get that ball of money?"
Marge,Really? Like what?
Marge,"Hmm. Well, I'm proud of you. You're such a good provider. Kids, come on -- thank your father for the injections!"
Marge,Hold still.
Marge,"Are you kidding? There's Funky Winkerbean! Over here, Funky! Look, it's the Noid! Avoid the Noid! He ruins pizzas!"
Marge,What's going on?
Marge,"Homer, bring that back in the house."
Marge,Do you want turkey sausage or ham?
Marge,I'm proud that you won the Pulitzer...
Marge,But I do feel bad about the starving children...
Marge,"Oh, well, that's good... Oh."
Marge,"Oh, that's a darling name for a dog."
Marge,Homie!
Marge,You're not my husband.
Marge,"Well, I sure don't feel like cooking."
Marge,"Oh, Homie!"
Marge,"The dog thinks so, too."
Marge,"Once you get used to the druggings, this isn't a bad place."
Marge,"Oh. They ought to call that a ""Large Island Iced Tea."" No, ""Long"" is better."
Marge,"Well, maybe a sip. I don't want to offend our mentalist."
Marge,Mmm.
Marge,You don't know what I'm missing.
Marge,Mmm. I'd like to visit that Long Island place. If only it were real...
Marge,I'll do it. I always end up doing it.
Marge,Marge.
Marge,"That's no gentleman, that's my husband."
Marge,"Oh, please. I didn't say that for clapping."
Marge,Yeah?
Marge,Ohhhh.
Marge,You talk too much. Abra-ca-blab-ra! Am I right?
Marge,See? The ladies know what I'm talkin' about.
Marge,I'm right here!
Marge,No! No! Get off me!
Marge,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Get 'em off!
Marge,"Could you cut it out, you two? Mommy needs some quiet right now."
Marge,But where did it come from?
Marge,What are you doing? Why are you frosting that old throw pillow?
Marge,Should I just back out of the room?
Marge,There you are. How was the magic act?
Marge,"Uh, sure looks that way... But at least Bart and Homer are spending quality time together."
Marge,"Oh, this? Hmm. I think it is."
Marge,You're a pretty girl.
Marge,It's ten in the morning!
Marge,You were carjacked in the church parking lot?!
Marge,"Oh, dear. We don't want that."
Marge,"Homie! Homie, wake up! They've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!"
Marge,They're arresting him right now!
Marge,"After we got Maggie to a safe house, of course."
Marge,They always say they're innocent. It's such a turn-off.
Marge,"Okay, players! That's a wrap!"
Marge,Squibs!
Marge,"He's doing ""Dreamcoat"" at the dinner theater."
Marge,"Ready for the circus, Homer?"
Marge,"Come on, Homer. They're only in town for eight months, then they're gone!"
Marge,"Finally, a circus full of whimsy and wonder."
Marge,They always pick the guy with the wires.
Marge,Look at those exotic positions.
Marge,Watching those women is giving me ideas...
Marge,"It's hauntingly beautiful, isn't it?"
Marge,"Oh, stop. Your father and I don't get the day off."
Marge,Lenny says we've got the day off! Yippee!
Marge,This is terrible. How will the kids get home?
Marge,"Seems like animated shows are everywhere. Or were, last year."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Well, maybe if you ate some meat you'd have a natural lubricant! You lost all our money?"
Marge,Are you crazy?! I'm not going to be a surrogate mother.
Marge,Forget it.
Marge,"Oh, Homer, where have you been?"
Marge,Really?
Marge,Do you feel smarter?
Marge,"Sweetheart, a missing crayon could be anywhere."
Marge,"Okay, it's in his brain."
Marge,"Homer, get up! Up, up, up!"
Marge,Oh no!
Marge,"Sorry, Homie, but you promised to take me to the Apron Expo today."
Marge,"C'mon. You and the kids always wanna do fun stuff, but today we're doing something I like."
Marge,"They're unveiling a combination apron/smock. It's called a ""Smapron."""
Marge,"No, ""Smapron."""
Marge,"C'mon, it'll be fun."
Marge,I'm a little disappointed. There were too many aprons.
Marge,There's so much evil in the world.
Marge,Somebody help him!
Marge,"Hey! Hey, over here! Here, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully!"
Marge,"How's your back, Homie?"
Marge,"Try to focus on something else. Umm... You like Jimi Hendrix, right?"
Marge,"Well, look at that painting."
Marge,Wow. The artist really captured Jimi's passion and intensity.
Marge,A convict painted that?
Marge,"Well, I studied art, and this guy's got a real gift."
Marge,Let's get outta this gosh-forsaken heck-hole.
Marge,What a waste of talent.
Marge,A sunset!
Marge,"Oh, nothing... How would you feel if I did some volunteer work at the prison?"
Marge,"Oh, Homie. I knew you'd support me."
Marge,Mrs. Marge Simpson. I'm here to teach an art class.
Marge,"Welcome to ""Freeing the Artist Within."" Not literally, of course."
Marge,"Okay. Now, I wanted to paint fresh fruit, but the prison cafeteria would only give me sauerkraut."
Marge,That's depressing.
Marge,Let's let a little sunshine in.
Marge,Question?
Marge,"Why, thank you, Jack."
Marge,"That's charming, Sardonicus, but try to use less of a stabbing action and more of a brushing stroke."
Marge,"Yeah, see how much better that feels?"
Marge,"Oh Jack, that's so soulful. How did someone so sensitive end up here?"
Marge,"Oh. Well, you know, lots of people shoot Apu. It's just a hundred-dollar fine now."
Marge,"I don't see any anger. I see a yearning for freedom... Um, do you have a title?"
Marge,Titles are hard.
Marge,"Terrific. Bart, Sideshow Bob says he'll be seeing you real soon."
Marge,"Oh, and guess who's up for parole? My diamond-in-the-rough."
Marge,Scary talented. And I'm gonna make sure the parole board knows it.
Marge,I might grease the wheels of justice with some cookies.
Marge,Not till you finish your sundae.
Marge,Two more bites.
Marge,"Warden, please. This man is a gentle soul. I know he's made mistakes, but someone with his talent belongs on a boardwalk doing caricatures. Not behind bars."
Marge,"Honestly, it wouldn't bother me."
Marge,"Oh, my Goodness!"
Marge,I hope this is okay. It's not very prison-y.
Marge,"Uh, Mecca? Well, let's..."
Marge,You remember Jack... He's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law.
Marge,"That's right, a job."
Marge,I know just where you can get one.
Marge,I read in the Daily Fourth Gradian that you need someone to paint a mural.
Marge,"Well, Jack here will do great work for you."
Marge,It's a small liberal arts college. Very law-abiding. No convicts at all.
Marge,I know... But the Lord will forgive me if it helps you get a second chance.
Marge,Farm couple?!
Marge,"Oh, Jack. I know you hate to betray your artistic vision, but just do it."
Marge,"Just till you make it. Remember, I believe in you."
Marge,Not until you finish your sundae.
Marge,What's wrong with my sundaes?
Marge,"Oh, don't fight. All great art is controversial at first. But years from now, people will point to these cuddly little creatures, and say, ""That's a Jack Crowley."""
Marge,"Now wait, you don't know that Jack did this. Just because he's an ex-con..."
Marge,"Oh, Jack... You threw it all away, over a stupid feud with Skinner."
Marge,Then why are you hiding?
Marge,So you really didn't do it?
Marge,"I believe you, Jack. Now let's get you out of here... Wait for my signal."
Marge,"Oh, Chief! I found some evidence that points to the real arsonist."
Marge,Not yet. You have to guess what it is.
Marge,"Oh, geez..."
Marge,You crumb-bum. You looked me right in the eye and lied to me.
Marge,"I just saw you! Get him outta here, Chief!"
Marge,"Thank you, honey. They come in a squeeze bottle now."
Marge,I'd better put on the silencer.
Marge,I don't know. It came with the house.
Marge,"Yes, it says here he's the movie magician behind ""Creepshow,"" ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Dawn of the Dead."""
Marge,So many restaurants...
Marge,"Umm... I guess I'll, I'll have the chicken Tandoori."
Marge,"Oh, look at you two. You look so ""couple-y."""
Marge,Stop that! And get ready! We're going to the old folks' talent show. Now get washed up.
Marge,"You know, a tennis court can really make your house look classy. I hear Mel Brooks has one. I mean, Sir Mel Brooks."
Marge,And it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
Marge,Can you believe it? Kent Brockman playing on our court!
Marge,"Homer, ball!"
Marge,Even bonnets?
Marge,Chief Wiggum! Are you here to make a bust of some kind?
Marge,As far as I know.
Marge,Would you boys like to play tennis?
Marge,"Okay, we'll be right out."
Marge,I thought you had your own court.
Marge,"Will you get serious, Homer? I'd like to win at least once."
Marge,"Ooh. Maggie, are your ears burning?"
Marge,You'll never guess what I heard in the supermarket today. I found out we're the laughingstock of the town.
Marge,"I thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability. Instead, people make fun of our lousiness."
Marge,All of that is you. You've gotta take this more seriously.
Marge,That's all I ask.
Marge,"No, it's a smooth motion... You follow through with your racket."
Marge,What? We're not ready to compete!
Marge,Get 'em off! Get 'em off!
Marge,"Oh, that's okay. Bart's doing fine. You just have another beer."
Marge,"Oh, hello, Homer."
Marge,"Uh, there's something I should tell you."
Marge,"Well, actually, the name of Bart's partner is..."
Marge,I'm Bart's partner.
Marge,"Oh, I'm sorry, Homie. We'll talk about it later, okay?"
Marge,"I was thinking mantle, too! Talk about being on the same wavelength."
Marge,"Oh, Homey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings."
Marge,I just wanted to win for once. Please don't take it as a threat to your manhood.
Marge,It's for charity -- it benefits victims of balcony collapse.
Marge,"Darling, you're so much handsomer than my first husband."
Marge,Lisa!
Marge,Did you make that awful effigy?
Marge,"Now Lisa, you know that's not true."
Marge,"Oh, you little-- Come on, Bart."
Marge,"Look, we're all trying to have dinner. So why don't we just... Psych! Psych! Psych!"
Marge,No we're not. You're going down.
Marge,"Once again, I'm outraged by this last-minute switch."
Marge,It's totally unfair for one side to have a professional player.
Marge,"Honey, I'll make it up to you in bottle rockets."
Marge,Oopsie!
Marge,"Oh. Oh, I'd do anything."
Marge,Why don't we stop this nonsense. I'm not mad anymore.
Marge,"After the tournament, let's go out for a nice family dinner."
Marge,"Well, I think it's good for a show to go off the air before it becomes stale and repetitive."
Marge,Look! Krusty invited us to the taping of his last episode.
Marge,"Where have you been, young man? It's nearly bedtime."
Marge,Why do you want Bart? He's not much of a singer.
Marge,"Okay, everybody. Say ""funny."""
Marge,Perfect.
Marge,"Oh, please. You get exhausted watching ""The Twilight Zone"" marathon! I'm a regular Billy Crystal."
Marge,"Hey, Grampa's running!"
Marge,Thank you so much for saving our son from that murderous mob.
Marge,My Bart?
Marge,But...
Marge,"Oh, Okay."
Marge,"Don't be selfish, Lisa."
Marge,"None of those girls has had three kids, I can tell you that."
Marge,Are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug?
Marge,Nobody's going home. We're going to see Bart's concert.
Marge,"Well, I'd like to go. How about you, Maggie?"
Marge,Squaresville sounds pretty cool.
Marge,Don't you mean Blocko shirt?
Marge,"Lisa, how's your Eiffel Tower kit?"
Marge,What kind of a thing is that to tell your children?
Marge,I'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
Marge,They wouldn't honor my coupon for two free streaks.
Marge,"Oh, Homie, I love them. I can't thank you enough."
Marge,"Well, Homie, I believe you're telling the truth about the Isotopes."
Marge,"Yeah, but what can you do?"
Marge,"Oh, Homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike. You eat while you brush your teeth. You're eating a huge sausage right now."
Marge,You're really not gonna eat anything?
Marge,"Goodbye, Homie. Here's Dr. Hibbert's number if you feel weak."
Marge,There's still more meatloaf.
Marge,"C'mon, c'mon, we all have to pitch in and eat your father's share."
Marge,"I don't do things that way, Lisa."
Marge,It's been a whole week! Why are you letting my husband die? What does that have to do with baseball?
Marge,He's not moving.
Marge,"Homer, you're still here? You should've left for work an hour ago!"
Marge,"And kids, you're gonna miss the school bus!"
Marge,It's only two blocks away!
Marge,You can spit on the bus.
Marge,"Not now, Lisa."
Marge,"Chew, chew, chew! Swallow, swallow, swallow!"
Marge,Not on my watch!
Marge,Stop! Stop!
Marge,"I'm not racing! It's me, Marge Simpson!"
Marge,I did it! I caught the school bus. Now hurry up and get on.
Marge,I won. Don't take that away from me.
Marge,"Yep. It's great to have some time just to ourselves, huh?"
Marge,Yeah. The uh... the milk really takes the edge off.
Marge,I got it!
Marge,"No, I got it!"
Marge,Springfield Baby-Proofing?
Marge,"Homer! Don't be... Wow, that is huge."
Marge,She got it open.
Marge,Why don't you try reaching out to this new girl? See if you two have a common interest.
Marge,"Okay, that's in the ""maybe"" file. What if you two bond over your Malibu Stacey dolls?"
Marge,She's not afraid of bunnies.
Marge,"No, no, no. Oh, Homie!"
Marge,I'm the one who told you that.
Marge,How are you supposed to dial?
Marge,"Isn't that a little excessive? I mean, how are the buttons dangerous?"
Marge,"Oh, that's ridiculous."
Marge,I'm a horrible mother.
Marge,"That's quite an act to follow, Lisa."
Marge,Where?
Marge,"Ooh, you're right. And that's not his wife."
Marge,So that's where that went.
Marge,"Oh, honey, we're so proud of you."
Marge,"I don't know if it matters, but it was a Time Magazine. Does that matter?"
Marge,What? What?
Marge,Most of it was sent by relatives who couldn't see very well.
Marge,"Hey, the dog smells something!"
Marge,"Homer, no! Those were made in the Sixties."
Marge,And these musical garment bags aren't bad either.
Marge,Who's Muntu?
Marge,On the ground?
Marge,Ohhhhhhhhh.
Marge,"Homie, did you remember to tip Kitenge?"
Marge,Nobody's a warthog.
Marge,"Ooh, look, everybody!"
Marge,He doesn't look so fast to me.
Marge,What? What is it?
Marge,"Oh, thank you. Your ground is so comfortable."
Marge,"Bart, I told you not to get your lip disked."
Marge,This song has been going on for hours.
Marge,Wonder where this river goes.
Marge,"Stay in the boat, Homer."
Marge,Look!
Marge,Let's just float by quietly...
Marge,"Oh, no! It's eating us!"
Marge,A chimp!
Marge,"Oh, isn't that sweet? He named it after his wife."
Marge,"Well, now I've heard everything."
Marge,"It's kind of you to take us in, Dr. Bushwell."
Marge,I-I love what you've done with these poles.
Marge,Ho-mer.
Marge,Even on the soles of her shoes.
Marge,"Don't worry, Doctor. We'll get you all the help you need."
Marge,Very nice.
Marge,"Hm, quite a promotion."
Marge,What happened to President Muntu?
Marge,Breakfast!
Marge,"It's a healthy cereal from Europe: ""Meus-lix."""
Marge,"They also make ""Juice-lix."""
Marge,They're for after dinner.
Marge,You can't have a brownie. Period.
Marge,No!
Marge,Stop it!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Marge,"Calm down! If we hurry, they can reattach your thumb."
Marge,We've just gotta get your thumb to the--
Marge,Where did it go?
Marge,I cut off my husband's thumb!
Marge,It was an accident!
Marge,"Arrest me?! Um, my address, it's, um... 1-2-3... Fake Street."
Marge,"We've gotta get to the hospital, Homer!"
Marge,Let's just say that Bart did it.
Marge,Doodlebugs!
Marge,"Homer, help!"
Marge,Isn't there anything you can do?
Marge,Hibbert's really losing it. We're going to Dr. Nick's.
Marge,Breakfast!
Marge,"We've got to get to the hospital, Homer!"
Marge,Lisa!
Marge,I stole it from McBain after I cut off your father's thumb.
Marge,Not right now. Your father's in there and --
Marge,"Oh, he's on the Blue Man group again. C'mon, we've got lotsa time."
Marge,"Oh, no. We're out of gas. I couldn't figure out this stupid Italian gas gauge."
Marge,"Hm, let's hitch a ride with that hick."
Marge,Shoo!
Marge,"Well, I've already borrowed one car. Let's go!"
Marge,Bart!!!
Marge,Breakfast!
Marge,Bart!!!
Marge,You leave those boys alone!
Marge,"It's all right, boys."
Marge,Except your thumb! And Lisa's science project!
Marge,"Boy, this sure was one crazy day...Right, Mr. Teeny?"
Marge,Could I have a swirl of chocolate and vanilla?
Marge,"Rachel Jordan? Isn't that the woman you had a crush on, Ned?"
Marge,"Oh, don't you worry. We'll make all the hard decisions so you don't have to."
Marge,Poor Ned. He can't look anywhere without being reminded of Maude.
Marge,"Homer, don't you have any respect?"
Marge,"Wow, three pairs of shoes. Someone had a fetish."
Marge,"Are you okay, Ned?"
Marge,Mm. That sounds perfect!
Marge,"Ned, I'm worried about you. You've been working non-stop for the past week."
Marge,It's a miracle!
Marge,You could give the money to the orphanage. I hear they need a new wall.
Marge,One more and I get a free hysterectomy.
Marge,What spinal cord injury?
Marge,"Oh, Homer won't be able to play for a long time."
Marge,"You shoo, Barney Gumbel!"
Marge,"That's not my Uncle Lou, and this man's not dead."
Marge,Why did you put my name on the sign?
Marge,"Oh, we're calling it day care."
Marge,"Homer, this man is from the ""Good Guy"" awards."
Marge,I contributed by not objecting too much.
Marge,The Teamsters said they'd pick it up by five.
Marge,I can't believe it. We won another contest!
Marge,"Yup, Delaware's got it all."
Marge,"Excuse me, hobo. Can you play something a little less unnerving?"
Marge,"Ooh, what a handsome man!"
Marge,"Ohhh, thank you."
Marge,"Hey, what are you doing?"
Marge,Ohhh!
Marge,Soon. I just need a few more yoga classes.
Marge,"Oh, look! A shooting star!"
Marge,"You can do it, Paul."
Marge,Townspeople...
Marge,The buffalo are gone. I think you shot them all.
Marge,How romantic!
Marge,This reminds me of our shotgun wedding.
Marge,"Grampa, we've been married for years. When are you gonna put down that gun?"
Marge,"Oh well, this is our stop."
Marge,Would you like to come sightseeing with us?
Marge,"Oh, listen, you can hear the beautiful ethnic serenade..."
Marge,Uh... hello.
Marge,No.
Marge,I'm not a cop.
Marge,No! Goodnight. Seesh.
Marge,Morning!
Marge,"Gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens."
Marge,"Homer, catching that leprechaun didn't help anything."
Marge,The best thing about a gypsy wedding is I'm not the hairiest woman here.
Marge,What? Bart is dead!
Marge,The gypsy said it would.
Marge,"Oh, no. A salesbot!"
Marge,"No housework, eh?"
Marge,"Hi, UltraHouse."
Marge,That voice could use a little personality.
Marge,Murder-suicides.
Marge,George Lazenby?
Marge,"All right, but I'm doing this because he was Remington Steele. He was Remington Steele, wasn't he?"
Marge,"Well, hello Pierce!"
Marge,"Ooo, that really covers the cat crap!"
Marge,"Pierce, that was delicious. Can we help you with the dishes?"
Marge,Not a very good one?
Marge,"Bravo, Pierce!"
Marge,Uh-huh. Absolutely. / Yep. /
Marge,Oh my!
Marge,"Sorry, sometimes I forget."
Marge,"Oh, Pierce. The water's perfect."
Marge,"Oh, you don't have to do..."
Marge,"Ohhh... Ohhh... Oh, Pierce, that's gooood..."
Marge,"Mmm... Good morning, Pierce. Where's Homer?"
Marge,That sounds like a lie.
Marge,Hello police? I think my house killed my husband.
Marge,No!
Marge,"Homer! Homer, you're alive!"
Marge,"Oh, this seems like such a waste. I mean, he was charming and witty."
Marge,Kids it's eight o'clock! You're gonna miss the bus to wizard school!
Marge,That's not good for the clock.
Marge,"Oh, how magical!"
Marge,She'll be killed!
Marge,It's about the only thing we do as a family anymore.
Marge,Uh-oh.
Marge,And unusual.
Marge,"Well, maybe it'll be fun. You'll get to spend more time together. Make sure your father takes his mood medication."
Marge,I can't take it anymore!
Marge,"Well, you can tell she's never had kids. Look how high and firm her breasts are."
Marge,No! I don't want you going in a bottle. That's what hobos do.
Marge,"Homer, just take him to the bathroom."
Marge,"Oh, Homie, no. We can't."
Marge,I don't want him to see us expressing our love.
Marge,No!
Marge,I'm sleeping in the bathtub.
Marge,She's such a butthole.
Marge,Don't be mad at Homer. I was the one who cut the rope.
Marge,No!
Marge,"Homer, no! We're not bad parents."
Marge,"No, I won't. And frankly, Judge, I think you're a bully."
Marge,"You're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, you can't see how much I love my kids."
Marge,"I don't mean to be disrespectful, Judge Harm, but we are not bad parents. And there isn't a tether in this world with enough fiber optics to make me say we are."
Marge,"Just, just let me get--"
Marge,Haven't we been humiliated enough?
Marge,"I just can't do that, Homer. It's a matter of principle. And I need you to support me in this."
Marge,But first we gotta break out of these stocks.
Marge,"I want goggles, too."
Marge,Ahh!!
Marge,"If that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real, they'd be furious."
Marge,"Concentrate, Homer."
Marge,"No. No, there it is!"
Marge,"We hate her, Homer."
Marge,Let's do this thing.
Marge,Let's go.
Marge,Get away from that window!
Marge,And help me with this banner.
Marge,Let's get out of here.
Marge,"Shh. No, we can't play now."
Marge,She's gonna find us!
Marge,"Homer, no!"
Marge,"All right, we got lucky that time, but I want everyone in this family to raise your hand and promise not to break the law for one full year."
Marge,What's that noise?
Marge,"What are you reading, Homie?"
Marge,"That's odd. He's outside, digging."
Marge,There's no drugs out there.
Marge,"Bart, this is Dr. Kaufman. He's a special kind of ""talking doctor."""
Marge,Running a bar is a full-time job and you don't even do your full-time job.
Marge,I thought this was gonna be your bar.
Marge,"Aw, I'm glad you two are friends again so we can all have Thanksgiving dinner together in this bar."
Marge,Ooh... It must be Chinese New Year.
Marge,Bart!
Marge,Oh.
Marge,Every house has a bathroom.
Marge,It's about time Mr. Burns found a woman. I can't stand to see a man single.
Marge,No! Everyone should be paired up.
Marge,It wasn't meant to be.
Marge,"New underpants? Homer, what are you up to?"
Marge,"Well, don't look too hip. You don't want that girl falling for you."
Marge,That was amazing. I hope the kids didn't hear us.
Marge,Devil beard?
Marge,Uh-oh.
Marge,Putting away groceries -- it's like unwrapping presents from yourself. Fruit roll-ups for Bart... beer roll-ups for Homer...
Marge,"Burly?! I bought the wrong brand, Maggie!"
Marge,I'll just take them right back to the store and-- Whoa.
Marge,Look at those massive plaid shoulders.
Marge,Look at that absorbativity! I've gotta tell someone...
Marge,Watch what happens when I spill this blue liquid.
Marge,Absolutely. You're about to get a lesson... in value!
Marge,And Burly's still got soaking power. Spill something else.
Marge,Spill it...
Marge,"Ooo, Burly, you're insatiable."
Marge,Burly. You're so rugged and manly...
Marge,"Oh, it's okay, Homie. The bee's all gone."
Marge,"""Dear Burly, comma, I've never written to a registered trademark before. Are you a real person, or just a composite, question mark? In either case, I would love a signed photo. Sincerely, Marge Simpson."""
Marge,Hello?
Marge,Person-to-person?!
Marge,How did you get my number?
Marge,"Oh, my goodness..."
Marge,Oh my God! Dinner with Burly!
Marge,You're not going to believe it. That paper towel lumberjack is coming here! For dinner! Tonight!
Marge,I will!
Marge,Oh my God!
Marge,Barney? W-w-where's Chad--
Marge,"Congratulations, I feel ridiculous."
Marge,I guess it was a pretty funny prank. I like the ones where nothing catches on fire.
Marge,"Do something, Mesmerino!"
Marge,We'd better get him home.
Marge,"Hmmm. And, Bart is set for the week."
Marge,"Oh, no..."
Marge,"Oh, Homey, you poor thing."
Marge,How do we un-repress it?
Marge,It would be a good excuse to use my Yaqui tea set...
Marge,"Well, is anything coming back to you?"
Marge,You found a corpse when you were twelve? No wonder you've been so traumatized.
Marge,Maybe there's murder afoot!
Marge,Maybe.
Marge,Thanks for understanding.
Marge,Maybe we should come back in the daytime.
Marge,Chief Wiggum!
Marge,"Water, eh?"
Marge,Burly to the rescue!
Marge,But whose body is it?
Marge,"Homer, shouldn't we give that skull to Mr. Smithers?"
Marge,"Lisa, don't sulk. You're on the Jumbotron."
Marge,"Sorry, we already solved it."
Marge,"Let's see what you have, Moe."
Marge,"Wow Moe, you've been doing a lot of sleuthing."
Marge,Who wants some Astro-lemonade?
Marge,"Look, I don't want to start a whole thing with this."
Marge,"Oh, he's leaving her with five babies."
Marge,"Oh, that's sensible."
Marge,This is the worst thing you've ever done.
Marge,Fixing all that damage is gonna be very expensive.
Marge,Let's just write to David Bowie again.
Marge,Isn't that skirt a little north of the knee.
Marge,Where's Bart?
Marge,Do a nice one for Grandma.
Marge,These new pews are so comfy.
Marge,Oh no...
Marge,You should be very upset.
Marge,A little much.
Marge,"Oh honey, I'm worried about your soul. I want at least one person from this family to go to Heaven."
Marge,"Her?! She's just kidding, Mr. Lord."
Marge,"You know, Lisa, around here, Buddhists don't get any desserts in their lunches."
Marge,"Hey Lisa, what are you doing?"
Marge,"Honey, is this about some boy at school who doesn't like you?"
Marge,Good. I'm just saying that any boy who doesn't like you is not worth your time.
Marge,You're gonna get a bath tonight.
Marge,She's not a devil. I just don't know what to do.
Marge,You think we can bribe her back with Christmas?
Marge,Time to begin Operation Xmas-Remind of-How good is.
Marge,Just do it. Do it. Do it now!
Marge,"I was just making Christmas cookies. But since you don't believe in Christmas anymore, I guess you don't want any."
Marge,Hm. It's a pity.
Marge,Here she comes! And-a one and-a two and-a...
Marge,"Oh. Hello, Lisa."
Marge,"Ah. Well, you do have a present under the tree. I guess no one told Santa you were a Buddhist."
Marge,"Lisa, we love you and we're not trying to put any pressure on you."
Marge,Oh no! Our daughter's run away on Christmas Eve.
Marge,We were looking for Lisa!
Marge,We'd better call the police.
Marge,Lisa?
Marge,You came back!
Marge,So you're just going to pay lip service to our church?
Marge,"Well, I'm just glad you're back."
Marge,"And don't worry, honey, I'll pray double hard for both of us. Now let's get you some Christmas cookies."
Marge,Yes! Merry Christmas to us all.
Marge,And a happy and healthy New Year.
Marge,"Happy, happy New Year!"
Marge,We don't need TV to have family fun. Why don't we play Monopoly?
Marge,Oh. We'd better stay inside. At least until the squirrels stop melting.
Marge,Let's stick to original Monopoly -- the game is crazy enough as it is.
Marge,How can an iron be a landlord?
Marge,"Lisa, it was probably an accident."
Marge,Stop fighting!
Marge,I've been prying them apart since before you were born!
Marge,This family has hit rock bottom.
Marge,"Sir, we know you're not an angel. My husband sees too many movies."
Marge,"Food keeps my family happy, so I make a few practice dinners before showtime. 'Cause at six o'clock, we go live!"
Marge,"We've got to do something, but what?"
Marge,"My driving ankle! Bart, I know this sounds crazy, but do you think you can drive the car?"
Marge,Here's the keys.
Marge,"You know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger."
Marge,You and Ned married a couple floozies?
Marge,"If I Had known there were loose women in Las Vegas, I would never have let you go."
Marge,This is the worst thing you've ever done.
Marge,"Get out, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, I don't know if I can ever forgive you. Please go away."
Marge,"Oh, no. She's making him a sandwich."
Marge,Why don't you come inside and we'll talk?
Marge,Bigamy.
Marge,You insensitive jerk! Maybe this family would be better off without you!
Marge,Why don't you just take Britney Beers and get outta here!
Marge,Our plan worked perfectly.
Marge,"I'm so proud of us. When we stick together, we can do anything."
Marge,Why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain?
Marge,"Lisa, you're not buying more than your weight in books."
Marge,"Well, what about this? ""The Duff Book Of World Records."""
Marge,It's got pictures of deformities.
Marge,I never agreed to that rule!
Marge,"Ow, my hairstyle!"
Marge,I can't believe it. Everyone's celebrating their obesity!
Marge,I don't know how this town got so fat.
Marge,"You kids do eat a lot of sugar. But at least Homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit."
Marge,Look at all the empty calories.
Marge,"Ooo, sugar free donuts."
Marge,Oh.
Marge,"Apu, everything in this store is overloaded with sugar."
Marge,"Well, I'm going to have a talk with them. Where are their worldwide headquarters located?"
Marge,That's lucky.
Marge,"I want you to stop putting so much sugar in everything, or at least warn people that it's so unhealthy."
Marge,Don't you have any sense of corporate responsibility?
Marge,Hey!
Marge,But we're on hiatus. Everyone's everywhere.
Marge,I'll play it later.
Marge,"If you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture."
Marge,"There was one in a cage, but he wasn't moving."
Marge,"That company's ruining the whole town's health, and I don't know how to stop them."
Marge,"Oh yeah, like Erin Brockovich."
Marge,I'm not sure I can afford a fancy lawyer.
Marge,"Aw, hop in."
Marge,We want to sue the sugar industry for selling a harmful product.
Marge,Don't worry. I'll do the legwork.
Marge,I'm filing a class action lawsuit against Big Sugar. Would you like to give a deposition?
Marge,"Oh, hello Homer."
Marge,What are you talking about? Is that dinner?
Marge,Why didn't you just turn off the oven?
Marge,Hello?
Marge,Who is this?
Marge,Professor Frink?
Marge,I was just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
Marge,Dessert's on. I steamed some limes!
Marge,"No, Homer!"
Marge,You'll be condemning this town to a life of obesity and diabetes!
Marge,"Please, Homie. Dump the sugar. For me."
Marge,"Gee, everyone looks so happy."
Marge,"Oh, all right. But take Maggie with you."
Marge,Mm. I guess you just can't use the law to nag. Maybe I should just stop trying to change the world.
Marge,That's the best one!
Marge,"Oh honey, think pink. Look, a salute to safe sex!"
Marge,Wouldn't it be great if that man and woman got together?
Marge,"It may contain brief rudeness, adult explosions, and scenes with Garry Shandling."
Marge,"Homer, you're going to get in trouble."
Marge,So your life is ruined.
Marge,"Oh dear, you can't eat solid foods. Those are his favorites."
Marge,"Stop it, Homer!"
Marge,I am not gonna make you another sparerib smoothie. Most people with their jaws wired shut don't gain weight.
Marge,How was your day? Do you really want to know?
Marge,"Well, let's see... I was in the kitchen, counting the corncobs on the curtains..."
Marge,When who should ring the doorbell but Ned Flanders.
Marge,It seems he wants to ban culottes in the schools.
Marge,"Pardon my French, but sometimes that man's a goofy-doofy."
Marge,"You know, tomorrow is the Annual Springfield Formal Event. We weren't going to go, after last year's... unpleasantness."
Marge,That donkey is such a bad influence on you.
Marge,But breaking your jaw has made you so sweet. Maybe we can go.
Marge,"Hmm, I'd better polish those jaw wires for tomorrow."
Marge,A formal. The one place you can wear a tiara and not look crazy.
Marge,Oh. It's just a false alarm.
Marge,"Mm, thank you."
Marge,This has been one of the most magical evenings of my life.
Marge,"I don't know what you said, but I'm sure it was beautiful. Oh Homer, this is the kind of night I thought we could never have together: incident free."
Marge,"Well, he would eat all the time. We'd be making love, and he'd have a mouth full of Hershey's Miniatures."
Marge,"And before he broke his jaw, he never listened, but now he takes to heart everything I say."
Marge,He did such crazy things -- roll clip.
Marge,"Please, Homie? No more craziness -- for me?"
Marge,"Hm, all clean, just the way I left it."
Marge,"Well, so much for new Homer."
Marge,What's going on?
Marge,"Well, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me."
Marge,This place is so dull. The nine-one-one button is covered with dust.
Marge,It's seven-thirty!
Marge,"Boy, things are going really good. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Hmm, look at that freckle. I should dig that out."
Marge,"Good, good, that feels good."
Marge,The Demolition Derby? That'll scratch my itch.
Marge,Don't hurt me! I'm not like you people! I'm loved!
Marge,Go around! Go around!
Marge,So many dings.
Marge,"Oh Homer, save me, save me!"
Marge,"This family needs a live wire, but it's just not me."
Marge,Aww...
Marge,"When Homer's jaw was crushed-crushed-crushed, his life took a nitro-burning funny turn!"
Marge,"Oh yeah! It's important to grow-grow-grow, but if you take it to the max-max-max, it's gonna get ugly!"
Marge,That sounds great.
Marge,I'm taking him to Dr. Hibbert's this afternoon. You know how hard it is to get a doctor on Wednesday morning.
Marge,I haven't lost so much sleep since little Barty had the scoots.
Marge,I'll get it!
Marge,Nooky In New York?
Marge,"If I'm not having sex by the end of this goat-cheese quesadilla, I'm gonna scream."
Marge,Please. We went out once.
Marge,Artie made mega-bucks with a revolutionary invention -- a converter that changes that horrible modem noise into easy-listening music.
Marge,...but then he turned into an octopus!
Marge,"Artie. Artie, no. Stop."
Marge,"Artie, get off of me."
Marge,"Well, I think you should get in touch with him. You know, just to congratulate him on his success."
Marge,"Well, I suppose I could write him a letter..."
Marge,"Okay, hold onto your hats. ""Dear Artie..."""
Marge,Congratulations on your recent TV appearance.
Marge,"You can't use the word ""sex"" on the internet."
Marge,"Anti-trust suit... anti-trust suit... A note from Marge Simpson? Well, isn't that a coincidence? I was just thinking about her..."
Marge,For the last twenty years!
Marge,Mm-hmmm!
Marge,For you. For you.
Marge,"Artie Ziff? Ohh, oh, that e-mail. Look, I got a little drunk and we..."
Marge,"Look, it's great to see you, but you should know I'm happily married."
Marge,Pretty much. Yeah.
Marge,"Homer, don't talk with your mouth full. I've told you before, it's rude."
Marge,Homie!
Marge,"Artie, that's a sick idea. Come on, Homer, we're leaving."
Marge,What?
Marge,"No way, no how! I'll get used to the snoring, just like I got used to saying ""Courtney Cox-Arquette""."
Marge,"Besides, I like some of the noises you make in bed."
Marge,"Wow! Homer, that was amazing."
Marge,Are you snoring while you're awake?
Marge,You need that surgery. We'll have to call Artie.
Marge,"Remember, Homie. I'm doing this for us. See you on Monday."
Marge,"Hello, Artie."
Marge,Where are you taking me?
Marge,Forwards?
Marge,"Oh, that's very sweet, Artie."
Marge,"Get off me, you little... nerd!"
Marge,I knew this weekend was just an excuse to get in my mouth. Keep your money. I'm going home.
Marge,Send the bill to Baron Von Kiss-a-lot.
Marge,"Oh Homie, I'm so glad to see... A tape on the bed?!"
Marge,"Marge, if you're watching this, then it means I've figured out how to work the camera. Last night I crashed a certain fake prom. That's right, Artie Ziff's fake prom."
Marge,Homer was there?
Marge,But I can explain!
Marge,This campus is so lush and verdant.
Marge,"Grampa, that happened a year and a half ago! We have to go save Homer."
Marge,Unless...
Marge,I really appreciate you helping me find Homer.
Marge,Of course.
Marge,Does that work on anyone?
Marge,Climb up!
Marge,"But, Homer..."
Marge,We can't take his money.
Marge,"And our marriage, with his latest invention -- the snore converter."
Marge,"Goodnight, Homie."
Marge,"For God's sake, Homer. Give them back their flame!"
Marge,Every four years.
Marge,"Ohhh, is that where Boozer drank the pee?"
Marge,"Mmmm. All this food is so frou-frou! Ooo, Faberge egg salad."
Marge,I make mine with M&Ms.
Marge,It's so cute you're going to a little girl's house.
Marge,That car's as big as all outdoors.
Marge,"I hope you enjoy these German sausages. I've been grinding all day, so I'm not sure what organ meat is in what intestinal casing."
Marge,It's only fair. We went to Europe when Lisa lost her balloon.
Marge,It's so clean and bland. I'm home!
Marge,"Oh, I see you drive on the left up here."
Marge,"Nice try. But we're still going to ""Riverdance""."
Marge,"Hurry up, Bart, or you'll be late to be killed by the dog."
Marge,I said you'll be late for school.
Marge,"Hi, honey. Where's that vicious dog? I made him a biscuit."
Marge,I guess you're not going to have an adventure this week.
Marge,Bart sure is fond of that cow gentleman.
Marge,"Aw, Homie, you'll always be my western hero."
Marge,"Thanks for coming, Mr. McCoy. We cooked your favorites: rattleJailbird meat, varmint kabobs, and refried whiskey."
Marge,Take him outside.
Marge,I'm not sure I approve of selling whiskey to children.
Marge,Oh.
Marge,"Well, I think westerns are due for a comeback."
Marge,You care about Bart's feelings.
Marge,I think we should try to restore Bart's faith in Buck. And we could start by getting Buck to quit drinking.
Marge,Have we gotten all the liquor?
Marge,"Well, we're not giving up. We're going to cure you of drinking."
Marge,"Well, I don't know. I just naturally assumed it was some of my business."
Marge,"Honey, I've got some bad news for you."
Marge,Honey...
Marge,There is no XFL this year. The league folded.
Marge,Last year's MVP. He sweeps up toenails at the beauty parlor.
Marge,Hello?
Marge,"Oh, my God!"
Marge,"Homer, your father's dead!"
Marge,But you were very open with your feelings.
Marge,The home told us you were dead.
Marge,"Grampa, come on."
Marge,"All right, Grampa. I'll help you get your license back."
Marge,Grampa's here to get his driver's license.
Marge,Why don't we double date? Then the restaurant will have to give us that booth.
Marge,Dude sure got his comeuppance.
Marge,"Grampa, I gotta tell ya, she's a stone-cold hoochie."
Marge,He used to be such an angel. Maybe you should give him another chance.
Marge,He is your dad.
Marge,"First he wrecks your car, then he steals mine. Your father's out of control."
Marge,So You've Settled for Branson.
Marge,Let's take a quick gambling break. A little action will really sharpen our senses.
Marge,"Oh, no. There's gambling. We just have to find it."
Marge,Betcha they're not! Three to one. How much you got?
Marge,Bill... bill...
Marge,Bill.
Marge,"Homer, you got a letter. Hm. It's from the library."
Marge,It's been so many years since I've seen your father. I hope he's still the magnificent physical specimen he was when he left.
Marge,"Oh, where could your father be?"
Marge,"Okay, it has been twenty years, and you suitors have been very patient."
Marge,"Well, look who the Fates dragged in."
Marge,"Oh, I can't stay mad at you."
Marge,"Brave Odysseus, it has been twenty long years. Regale me with tales of your adventures."
Marge,"Ooh, did you say Joan Van Ark?"
Marge,It's never Joan Van Ark.
Marge,"Bartrand, where is your sister Joan? Morning bells are ringing. Morning bells are ringing!"
Marge,God wants you to lead the French army to what?
Marge,Don't burn her! She's just an innocent child!
Marge,"Joan, renounce your faith! Save yourself!"
Marge,"Of course they didn't, honey."
Marge,"""Just then, Sir Lancelot rode up on a white horse and saved Joan of Arc. They got married and lived in a spaceship. The end."""
Marge,"Well, it's easier to chew than that Bambi video."
Marge,I love these jesters. They're exactly what I need to forget about my first husband.
Marge,"No, last week they became Vertiqual."
Marge,Sit down.
Marge,Hamlet! What'd I tell you about running with swords?
Marge,"Wow, everything is so high-tech."
Marge,No way I'm cleaning up this mess.
Marge,Our phone bill is four hundred dollars! They charged us for a call to Brazil.
Marge,Homer! They must have made a mistake. We'll just go down to the phone company and straighten it out.
Marge,"Uh, I think we're with Comquaaq."
Marge,"Ooh, that's the Movie Phone guy."
Marge,"We've met you many times, Ms. Naegle. Why do you keep changing jobs?"
Marge,Oh.
Marge,We've been charged for calls to Brazil that we didn't make.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"We're not paying our bill, so the phone company shut off our service."
Marge,"Homer, what are you going to do?"
Marge,That's it. We're just going to have to pay for that call to Brazil.
Marge,You made that call? But you're the good one.
Marge,Why did you do it?
Marge,"Oh, aren't you sweet? Sharing your allowance with a poor Brazilian boy."
Marge,How come you talked for four hundred dollars?
Marge,That's right. They have powers.
Marge,He's so adorable. Can we have another baby?
Marge,"I don't know, it's awfully expensive to fly to Brazil."
Marge,"Well done Bart, but in Brazil they speak Portuguese."
Marge,But Homer...
Marge,It says here we can get anywhere we want by taking a conga line.
Marge,"Bart, what are you watching?"
Marge,Bert and Ernie left it to your imagination.
Marge,What a charming neighborhood.
Marge,Works for me.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Excuse me, we think this boy might be here."
Marge,I don't think my daughter should hear this.
Marge,"Aw, look at all the stuffed coatimundi."
Marge,I'll just get her this bracelet.
Marge,Everything here is something.
Marge,"All right family, who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?"
Marge,"Oh, you two! We're eating genetically modified vegetables! Look how big they are."
Marge,That's baby corn.
Marge,There's nothing to be afraid of. They're all grown by the vegetable division of Union Carbide.
Marge,That's it. From now on I'm growing all our vegetables myself.
Marge,Go away! Go away!
Marge,"I've tried heckling them, I've tried jeckling them, it's time I made myself a scarecrow."
Marge,Go away! Go away!
Marge,Shoo! Shoo!
Marge,"Yeah! I did it! Marge is in the house! Or, I will be soon. 'Cause it needs some cleaning!"
Marge,"Homer, I'm very uncomfortable having a gang of crows in our bedroom."
Marge,I'm sleeping on the couch.
Marge,What's that billowing down the stairs? It's smoke!
Marge,Uh-oh.
Marge,"Homer, you're doing drugs!"
Marge,And now I'm guilty of possession! I could go to prison! Unless I testify against you...
Marge,Hello?
Marge,"Honey, I like it when you call, but we just talked five minutes ago. Hang on, I've got call waiting."
Marge,Hello?
Marge,Where did you get that suit?
Marge,"Look, I'm really starting to worry. There's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere, we're all out of paperclips, and the curtains smell like doob!"
Marge,"Homie, I don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?"
Marge,"Good night, Homer."
Marge,"Homie, you don't need drugs anymore. Your eyes are all better."
Marge,"Homer, it's over. I want you to look at your children and promise them you will never do drugs again."
Marge,Why are you keeping that thing?
Marge,"Don't worry, Homer. You don't need Mary Jane to laugh at Mr. Burns' jokes. Just picture him naked."
Marge,"Or, or, um, with, with a funny hat on."
Marge,"Now before we get there, you have to put this blindfold on."
Marge,"Homer, these people are professional roasters. Don't give them fodder!"
Marge,What are you doing here?
Marge,"So, I guess you can't destroy Earth, since so many of your favorite celebrities live and work there."
Marge,"I like ""Little Dot."" Could you rip that off? I mean, who's gonna know?"
Marge,"Hm, that little girl sure loved dots."
Marge,"Homer, what are you doing?"
Marge,"No, you're angry. Look, you're punching the cat right now."
Marge,"If you ask me, you should give up fatty foods."
Marge,Did it again!
Marge,Hm. Where in the hell is that soothing music coming from?
Marge,Homer? What's going on?
Marge,"Bart, your prank caused ten million dollars in damages."
Marge,You mean I shouldn't punish Bart at all?
Marge,Okay.
Marge,Are you sure you can get your deposit back? It's in pretty bad shape.
Marge,"Homie, what's wrong?"
Marge,"Oh, it must be something big. Hm. Something you did?... no, something you saw."
Marge,Apu is having an affair?!
Marge,How did you find out?
Marge,"Oh, this is so awkward. Today's the day we play badminton with them. Oh, I hope no one makes any double entendres."
Marge,"No, no, no, let's just keep playing. What's the score?"
Marge,We have to do something to save that marriage. Maybe I should just tell Manjula. Or you could talk to Apu...
Marge,What would that accomplish?
Marge,"Homie, it's eleven at night. Have you told him yet?"
Marge,Tell that woman it's over between you and her.
Marge,Sure.
Marge,Is that Windex?
Marge,"Kids, we want to talk to you about something."
Marge,"I just wish there was something we could do... Oh. Oh, Homer, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Marge,"Tonight, we invite both Manjula and Apu for dinner, but we don't tell them the other one's coming."
Marge,"I keep telling you. Off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man. But if we remind Apu and Manjula of why they fell in love, maybe they can work out their problems."
Marge,"Manjula, we've got a special guest for you."
Marge,Even better.
Marge,Look who's here. It's this thing!
Marge,"Manjula, come quick! The octuplets said their first words."
Marge,They miss their father. Are you sure you don't want to take him back?
Marge,All right! Girls night out! Exotic male dancers at the Golden Banana!
Marge,"Oh. Well, when Homer does something wrong, I write a list of ways he can make it up to me. Then I shred the list and put it in his food."
Marge,At the Golden Banana?
Marge,I know a great nametag place. They do fabulous work.
Marge,"Look Lisa, there's an opening."
Marge,My little munchkin bumped her pumpkin.
Marge,"What's wrong with him, Doctor? It can't be mange, I just had him dipped."
Marge,I knew it was serious when he said he didn't want ice cream.
Marge,"Well, your father ate it all."
Marge,You'll get the hang of it. Today's just a little gusty.
Marge,"Bart, don't slurp your soup."
Marge,College is no place for a young girl with those quadrangles and study carrels and syllabi...
Marge,"Oh, and this kitchen isn't?"
Marge,"I put those ""Cathys"" on the fridge for you. I don't even like them. They've gotten so smutty."
Marge,"Homer, Cathy is a woman."
Marge,In the tree.
Marge,"Oh, I can't wait to see my surprise!"
Marge,"A koi pond! It's beautiful. Oh you sweet, wonderful man-child. I finally have a peaceful place to sit and hear my own thoughts."
Marge,What does he want now?
Marge,"That woman is taking advantage of you, and we need you to do things around here. The oven light is out and you never finished filling up the aquarium."
Marge,Fine. I'll go talk to her.
Marge,"...Homer's family needs him too, and that's that."
Marge,"Well, let me sew that up for you."
Marge,"Darn her socks?... I say, darn her! I'll do them and then I'm outta here."
Marge,"Freshen your drinks, ladies?"
Marge,"I am so sick of doing her dirty work. She's taking advantage of us, Homer."
Marge,She's got a set of lungs on her.
Marge,"Oh my gosh, she's dead."
Marge,"Chief Wiggum, Homer and I are innocent."
Marge,No!
Marge,"Oh dear, now everyone will think Homer and I did it. The real killer is the man with the braces."
Marge,Go away!
Marge,"Wait, wait! That's a suggestion, not a threat!"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"This is ridiculous. You've been through my delicates, my silkies, my dainties, and my unmentionables."
Marge,"Oh Homer, what are we going to do?"
Marge,I can't believe we've been arrested for murder.
Marge,But we're innocent! It was the man with the braces.
Marge,"We appreciate your coming to comfort us, but we're not Catholic."
Marge,How can you have such an appetite at a time like this?
Marge,It's hard to get in the mood... with all those murderous eyes staring at us...
Marge,"Homie, I'm sorry. I can't. I just keep thinking about everything we're gonna miss. The kids growing up, grandchildren..."
Marge,My love. You saved my life.
Marge,I'll always love you.
Marge,It's the man with the braces!
Marge,Mrs. Bellamy?
Marge,"Oh Homie, I'm so lucky to be married to such a selfless and loving man."
Marge,I'm back here.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Finally, some repression."
Marge,No beer!
Marge,I don't care what they say. I won't feel safe in this town until we have better police.
Marge,"Homer, this is all your fault. If you hadn't plugged in your dancing Santa, none of this would have happened."
Marge,"Yes, and she's crying."
Marge,"Oh, forget it. They couldn't catch a cold with a... a, a cold-catching thing."
Marge,"You said you'd do something, and you followed through on it."
Marge,"If you like protecting people, you could make that your job. You know, start a security company."
Marge,That commercial is very effective.
Marge,"Well, they're both lovely."
Marge,"Hold your heads up high, kids."
Marge,"Homie, to honor Springfield's newest hero, I made you your favorite dinner. All three courses are dessert."
Marge,Dessert is three desserts.
Marge,Huh?
Marge,"Homie, please. Why don't you just leave town?"
Marge,"Fat Tony, how can you do this?"
Marge,"But you're just perpetuating a negative Italian-American stereotype. I mean, you could be a pizza man, organ grinder, uh... leaning tower maker... and... did I say pizza man?"
Marge,Somebody does care!
Marge,"Oh Homie, I'm so glad you're alive!"
Marge,"I'm so glad this all worked out. Thanks for saving my husband, Chief."
Marge,"Well then, who shot all the gangsters?"
Marge,Hm. Time to check in on our little sweetie pie.
Marge,"Yeah, probably dreaming about the time she shot Mr. Burns."
Marge,"But this is your chance to contact your late wife, Maude."
Marge,"Maude Flanders, we the living beseech you to appear."
Marge,I've got a whole list of things for you to do today.
Marge,My favorite is number three!
Marge,Those were for the church breakfast.
Marge,"What do you think, Homer? Does this make my hips look big?"
Marge,Aren't you a dear.
Marge,"Homie, you've been such a sweetheart today. Let's go upstairs and..."
Marge,"Kids, your father made us breakfast."
Marge,"Homie, I must say you have the energy of twenty men lately."
Marge,Aww.
Marge,"They look like you, they were rude to Patty and Selma, and the horde has been described as ""very gassy."""
Marge,"Thank you, General. That's a big relief."
Marge,"The horde is almost dead! There's still some writhing and twitching, but that should stop by morning."
Marge,One handsome hubby is all I need.
Marge,No bellybutton?! You're a clone! Then the real Homer...
Marge,My Homie's dead? How will I go on?
Marge,Oh well.
Marge,"I very much doubt that, Homer. These are horrible ghouls from the past."
Marge,Dr. Hibbert? But we heard you'd gone mad.
Marge,"Homer, someone's in trouble!"
Marge,"Dr. Hibbert, this is a top-notch resort. Can you recommend some activities?"
Marge,"Homie, something very creepy is going on here."
Marge,I think I'm going to do a little sleuthing.
Marge,House of Pain. This must be where you pay the bill. Why am I always so funny when no one's around?
Marge,"""Dear Homie, Had to buy diapers for Maggie. Love, Marge."""
Marge,Simpson.
Marge,"Homie, it's five p.m. We're having dinner."
Marge,It's true. I couldn't even wake you up for work this morning. I had to tell Mr. Burns you had violent diarrhea.
Marge,But you did have violent diarrhea. Nobody open the hallway closet until I say it's okay.
Marge,That explains that.
Marge,"Oh, you big fooler. Pretending not to remember so you could surprise us."
Marge,"Oh, Homie..."
Marge,So I'm just some babe who sank her claws into you?!
Marge,Get in.
Marge,Get in.
Marge,A place where you'll never be bothered by your family again.
Marge,"Get out of the car, Homer."
Marge,Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp!
Marge,"We had a family meeting and decided that even though what you said about us was incredibly thoughtless and hurtful, you had a point."
Marge,You work a job you don't like so I'm able to be home with the kids.
Marge,"So to say thank you for all your sacrifices, we spent our family vacation fund on something that's just for you. Do you like it?"
Marge,"That was great, Homie."
Marge,"I'm glad you had fun, but it's time to come home."
Marge,"I'm so proud of you, Homie. It's like you're Kid Rock and I'm Pamela Anderson Lee Rock."
Marge,"I'm his groupie! Am I saying that right, ""groupie?"""
Marge,"Why is he performing the duties of a roadie? Am I saying that right, ""roadie?"""
Marge,Did they ever find Tom Petty's toe?
Marge,A year ago you said they were the greatest thing that ever happened to us.
Marge,"Get back, honky cat! Those systems are too expensive."
Marge,Why don't you turn off the TV and join us for dessert? I made a pie.
Marge,Would you like some ice cream with that?
Marge,"Kids, look what I got you for your third grade field trip -- matching fanny packs!"
Marge,Now your fannies match.
Marge,Stop! You'll crush your juice boxes!
Marge,"Well, make sure you don't. And try not to let your brother get under your skin."
Marge,"Hello, Principal Skinner."
Marge,What?
Marge,My poor babies!
Marge,The plastic casing from the tip of Bart's shoelace! A mother knows!
Marge,"Oh my special little guys. You're okay, you're okay!"
Marge,DAD LEFT THE MILK OUT / YUCK YUCK YUCK YUCK YUCK...
Marge,"That's good satire -- it doesn't hurt anyone. What do you think, Maggie?"
Marge,"Ooo, look. There's your father."
Marge,"Well, I've read enough articles about flirting to know it when I see it."
Marge,"Ah, Homie, are you as attracted to me as you were when we met?"
Marge,Sometimes I worry you might think about other women.
Marge,That doesn't sound very convincing.
Marge,"Manjula, remember when Apu cheated on you?"
Marge,I'm worried Homer might do the same thing. What would make a husband lose interest like that?
Marge,"Oh my God, is that me?!"
Marge,"Faced with a problem like this, I wonder, what would Oprah do?"
Marge,"Now, I need some liposuction -- just enough to make me attractive to this man."
Marge,"Doctor, before we begin, I have a couple questions."
Marge,What if I just do aerobics and ...
Marge,"That's funny. Hm, I don't feel sucked out."
Marge,What on earth have you done? My McGuppies became bazongas!
Marge,"Accidentally giving me breast implants is not a ""simple misunderstanding."" My surgery was botched!"
Marge,You had no right to make my bosom this ample!
Marge,Oh I'll come back all right. And I'll bring my husband to do a little malpractice on you.
Marge,"Oh, sweetie."
Marge,/ Oh.
Marge,"Don't worry, Maggie, I'll have these silly things out in just two days. Till then I'll just try to hide them from the family."
Marge,Not feeling well. Going to bed. Dinner and breakfast are on the table.
Marge,Yes!
Marge,"Homer, let me explain something--"
Marge,"Homie! Oooo, Homie... Hey, what happened?"
Marge,"Now, don't get too used to these. That awful doctor said he'd take them out in a couple of days."
Marge,"They do make my neck look thinner... Oh, all right, let's do it."
Marge,"Now wait, Homer."
Marge,"Thank you, fellas."
Marge,"KEEP IN MIND, THEY'RE ONLY TEMPORARIES."
Marge,"Homer, how come you never sang a song like that to me before?"
Marge,"Homie, I could use a little more excitement in my life."
Marge,Maybe I'll just keep these.
Marge,"Don't make a fuss over me, boys. Just pour me a beer in a clean glass."
Marge,"It's for my back spasms. If guys didn't keep pinching my tush, I'd never stand up straight."
Marge,I'm afraid all that attention is from the wrong kind of people.
Marge,"Kiki, I'm tired of trade show modeling. My back really hurts."
Marge,Did you just drug me?
Marge,Eighty-nine percent of Americans would rather have a shoehorn than a computer.
Marge,I've heard about you vendors!
Marge,"Wait, wait! My son, my husband and the Van Houten boy are in there!"
Marge,"I've gotta stop them from shooting... I, I, don't... Lisa, don't hate me for this..."
Marge,Hey cops! Check out this all-points bulletin!
Marge,"I finally feel like me again. You're not disappointed, are you?"
Marge,"Anyway, you're the only man I want ogling me."
Marge,"Oh, Homie."
Marge,"Can't beat a skybox. All the excitement of being in the sky, with the security of being in a box."
Marge,"Wow, it's so fancy. It's like Moby's house on ""Cribs""!"
Marge,"C'mon, Lisa. It's time to go."
Marge,They've already told the skybox fans who's gonna win.
Marge,Your sister getting something nice doesn't hurt you in any way.
Marge,Bart! Watch your potty mouth!
Marge,Can you save our house?
Marge,Why do you always hire the cheapest guy?
Marge,So... when can we go back in our house?
Marge,Don't you have any rooms? We can't live in our house for six months.
Marge,"Wow, Lenny. Your apartment is stunning."
Marge,Thanks for letting us stay with you.
Marge,We are not staying at Moe's. Maggie's already drunk on the fumes. And she's a mean drunk.
Marge,"Hey, if TV can give Mike O'Malley a home, it can give us one."
Marge,Your school chums are going to be so jealous of your little outfit.
Marge,Squiggy?
Marge,Ooh... Please be a melon-baller. Please be a melon-baller.
Marge,My hair isn't really blue.
Marge,I need that tape!
Marge,It takes six hours to make breakfast now.
Marge,I'll just take these Tampons.
Marge,"Yes they did, look closer."
Marge,Twenty-three skidoo!
Marge,"Well, okay. Blow out that lamp and I'll take off my Victorian undergarments."
Marge,If you just...
Marge,No!
Marge,Almost done.
Marge,All of you stink so much.
Marge,"Bart, honey, would you like some more cod liver oil?"
Marge,He's betrothed to Martha Take-a-punch.
Marge,This rope was woven from handlebar mustaches.
Marge,"Oh no, everything's ruined. Our good bellows... our stereopticon... Squiggy! Homer, your strop! Your strop!"
Marge,That's my Homie!
Marge,"No, Homer, no! That's our only way home!"
Marge,"Oh, it sure is good to be home."
Marge,"Hm, I guess we'll have to find a new way to entertain ourselves."
Marge,Yeah. If we read books we could form a club.
Marge,Three minutes forty seconds -- a new personal best!
Marge,Maggie?
Marge,No one will ever know.
Marge,Anything good?
Marge,"Oooh, that place is famous. It's where J. Lo hit P-Diddy upside the head with Gary Coleman."
Marge,Kent Brockman?!
Marge,"Ooh, these turtles know just where the knots are. It just shows you God has a plan for every creature."
Marge,What position is this?
Marge,You have to do something to protect my husband.
Marge,Paris?
Marge,I'm never gonna go to Paris.
Marge,I don't think this was a great place to bring the children.
Marge,The late Frank Grimes...
Marge,And the state of Florida.
Marge,"These are Homer's friends and family. They don't want him dead, they just want him to suffer."
Marge,"Uh, Bob... I know you're enjoying fall preview week, but I was wondering if you made any progress towards finding Homer's killer?"
Marge,"Well, just a little one."
Marge,"Oh my, it's stuck!"
Marge,"Honey, the king of Mardi Gras has to ride around on a float all day. You'll be a sitting duck."
Marge,But I'm afraid you'll get hurt.
Marge,Today's Tuesday and you've had six beers.
Marge,That museum has been nothing but trouble since it opened.
Marge,"Hey, they have Latin Grammys."
Marge,Orlando? Are we going to Sea World?
Marge,"It's nice and cool in here, don't you think?"
Marge,"Wow, this restaurant is so international. Le Pizza, Der Hamburger, Señor Grilled Cheese... I hope I don't accidentally order an elephant."
Marge,I get to tamp the powder!
Marge,What are you doing here?
Marge,"And he's good around the potty, too."
Marge,I agree -- a girl should have her own private diary. I had to share mine with my uncle.
Marge,"Okay Lisa, now open the present from your father and me."
Marge,You were supposed to get her that stupid diary!
Marge,"Chief Wiggum, my daughter is innocent until proven guilty."
Marge,"Oh, I can't stop worrying about Homer and Lisa."
Marge,"Oh thank you, sweetie."
Marge,Hello?
Marge,"Uh, ""A."" And I'd like to add that proposition ""Hug Lisa For Me"" has my full support."
Marge,But there's no room for you.
Marge,"Bart, don't say it like that. You'll hurt her feelings-- Jeez Louise! How did you turn cinnamon applesauce into that?"
Marge,Summary emergency!
Marge,"Apu, where's your bathroom?"
Marge,There's a happy baby. Aren't you? Aren't you?
Marge,Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!
Marge,That's not a purse. It's a diaper bag.
Marge,"It looks like a purse, that's why I bought it, but it's really a--"
Marge,"Look, this really made me feel vulnerable. I want to know how soon you think you'll catch this guy."
Marge,Why is it Ned Flanders?
Marge,"Okay Marge, you can do this. You've done it a thousand times before."
Marge,Oh no! I pepper sprayed Ralph!
Marge,Sorry!
Marge,Let's go home. There's nothing dangerous there except for the electrical wiring.
Marge,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'll come right out and help you."
Marge,No! It'll tangle!
Marge,"Sorry, I can't go outside. I'll call for help."
Marge,"Oh, my God. Isn't there anything I can do?"
Marge,What if I can't feel comfortable outside again?
Marge,I do!
Marge,"All right, just to the mailbox and back."
Marge,"Two, three, two..."
Marge,Eight...
Marge,Two...
Marge,"Ten, ten, ten, ten..."
Marge,Twelve... fifteen... seven hundred and three...
Marge,"Oh my goodness, it looks just like the Kwik-E-Mart!"
Marge,I'm gonna sleep down here tonight.
Marge,Amen. Over.
Marge,Whack him with the hymnal. Over.
Marge,I'm sending the cat up with your lunches.
Marge,Goodbye kids.
Marge,"What to do now. Too crazy to go outside, not crazy enough to have imaginary friends."
Marge,Why did Homer buy those? No one's ever gonna use 'em.
Marge,Ten... E-le-ven... TWELVE!
Marge,I can bench twice as much as when I started! And look at my abs!
Marge,"Ooh, you know what would zest up this hollandaise? A lemon!"
Marge,I got all the way out to the tree before I realized I'd left the house.
Marge,I'm stronger than I've ever been! I don't have to go back inside. I'm not afraid!
Marge,I'm not afraid!
Marge,"Ned, I'm not afraid!"
Marge,Grampa! I'm not afraid!
Marge,You!
Marge,Not any more!
Marge,You've just been Marge-inalized!
Marge,"Ruth Powers, my old neighbor? Oh, my goodness, look at you!"
Marge,Wow!
Marge,I don't have those kind of muscles.
Marge,Steroids!?
Marge,I can't take drugs -- I have so many anti-drug bumper stickers. I'd be making a liar out of my tailgate.
Marge,But aren't there side effects?
Marge,"No, no!"
Marge,I feel good... with no repercussions!
Marge,"A little of this and a little of that. Bulkenoids for my lats, mesomax for my delts, and estrogen blockers for that minty taste."
Marge,"Hurry up kids, you'll miss the bus!"
Marge,"Not so fast, busboy!"
Marge,"Bye, kids! Bye, bye!"
Marge,"Hey, hot stuff. I've got a competition tomorrow. I could use a good-luck snuggle."
Marge,Let's do it!
Marge,I wasn't asking.
Marge,"So then I pop my delts, clench and bam! Not a dry eye in the house."
Marge,And that's why I didn't win!
Marge,"Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna up my glyco-load, use a denser ripping gel..."
Marge,"Damn straight, I didn't sacrifice my period for second place!"
Marge,Maybe death will stop your yammering!
Marge,"Oh, my gosh, you're right: steroids have turned me into everything I hate. Let's go home, Sweetie."
Marge,Club soda will get that blood out.
Marge,"You know, I really do miss being a lady."
Marge,"Oh, Homie."
Marge,Mm-hmm.
Marge,"Bart, you're a little young to be growling at seven foot Chinese ladies."
Marge,What are you doing?
Marge,That's because you keep passing out on our lawn.
Marge,"Homer, God isn't some kind of holy concierge. You can't keep bugging Him for every little thing."
Marge,I'll just call a plumber.
Marge,"You know, most people pray silently."
Marge,How bad is it?
Marge,"Homer, we can't sue the church. They'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin."
Marge,"Homer, for the last time..."
Marge,Please give the church back.
Marge,That is gonna drive me nuts.
Marge,"I'm so sorry, Reverend."
Marge,"Homer, that was not very Christian of you."
Marge,I really enjoyed your sermon. Particularly the part about the pin in the gutter on lane fifteen.
Marge,Are you sure? Because it really spoke to me.
Marge,"I'm sorry, Ned. Looks like God has packed up and left Springfield."
Marge,"Homer, send these people home. This housewarming party's been going on for two days."
Marge,"Homer aren't you afraid you might be, I don't know, incurring God's wrath?"
Marge,"See, I don't know that He is. In the bible he's always smiting and turning people into salt."
Marge,It's Reverend Lovejoy!
Marge,Well here's another low-rated annual event -- Spring Cleaning!
Marge,"Come on, everyone's helping."
Marge,You've gotta get rid of those Furbies. They've turned feral!
Marge,I can't believe you talked me into this.
Marge,Don't go telling your buddies at work about this.
Marge,"Honey, you did have a great time doing those commercials. And you made a lot of money."
Marge,"Your father invested it in a college trust fund, which today must be worth a..."
Marge,"Of course, the stock market's been down lately."
Marge,But there must be some sort...
Marge,"Bart, stop that!"
Marge,"Bart, the larynx is not a plaything."
Marge,"I heard a wonderful saying today: ""forgive and forget."""
Marge,"Bart, you're suing us?!"
Marge,I wanted a sewing room. But not like this. Not like this!
Marge,"Homer, don't make things worse."
Marge,"Please don't go, Bart. I'll let you swear in the house. Everything but the big three."
Marge,"Oh honey, I can't believe this is happening. I'll miss you so much."
Marge,He should have done that with the real Bart when he had the chance.
Marge,Darn it! I keep pouring juice for five.
Marge,I think he might come home if we can show him we can treat him better.
Marge,I don't think this is a good place for a ten-year-old boy.
Marge,Here's five dollars. Buy yourself a suit and get busy.
Marge,"Well, that's great, honey."
Marge,I can't count how many times your father's done something crazy like this.
Marge,I could have sworn it was three hundred and two.
Marge,"School's starting, Bart. Aren't you excited? This year you learn about local history!"
Marge,"Ooh, a new hamburger sandwich."
Marge,"Well this is very impressive, Lisa. I'm kicking this right onto the mantle."
Marge,"I'm just happy you're excited about something besides saving the whales. Face it, they're doomed!"
Marge,"Oh, our little girl's got her own cheering section!"
Marge,"Lisa, I'm so impressed you're state champ."
Marge,"Well, why don't we celebrate by going to a movie?"
Marge,"Okay, Champ. I before E, except after C."
Marge,"Really? Hmm. Well what about in the sentence ""Jim Nabors is way cool""?"
Marge,It's on my apron.
Marge,It's so exciting! It's like living in a dictionary.
Marge,He's adorable! I'd sure like to tuck that in at night.
Marge,"Congratulations, sweetie. You're in the finals!"
Marge,"Don't worry, honey. You can win without him."
Marge,"What is it, sweetie?"
Marge,"Oh sure. I mean, not on your father's salary, but I could... give piano lessons."
Marge,I just gotta stay one lesson ahead of the kid.
Marge,"Lisa, honey you spelled the word wrong, but you did the right thing."
Marge,Hold your horses. I was up all night fishing out the drawstring from your father's swimsuit.
Marge,Then all that's left is to protect Maggie from the sun.
Marge,"Well, it ain't happening today."
Marge,"Oh, what a magical evening. The moonlight, the music, the water..."
Marge,Poor Ned. This is his first Jellyfish Festival alone.
Marge,Sara Sloane has been involved with every Tinseltown hunk from Affleck to Zmed!
Marge,"Ms. Sloane, I loved you in ""Sleeping with Pinocchio"" and ""Honey, I Scotchguarded the Kids""."
Marge,"And Ned, I haven't seen you this happy in years."
Marge,"Lisa, Springfield isn't a cultural wasteland. Part of ""Stroker Ace"" was filmed at our airport. And, um, oh! There's our Ladies' Book Club. Sara, you're more than welcome to come."
Marge,"Today's book is ""Bridget Jones' Diary."" Now, let's go around the room and analyze why we didn't read it."
Marge,His answer's not at the bottom of a hedge.
Marge,"I'm very happy for you, Ned."
Marge,Not the swear jar! It's the only thing holding back the filth!
Marge,Nutty fudgkins!
Marge,What?
Marge,Why is that jet flying so close to our house?
Marge,"Maggie, give me that!"
Marge,How much longer is this going to go on?
Marge,We've already been to room 915. We've already filled out form 1790.
Marge,"Look, can you please just tell us why you've changed the flight paths?"
Marge,There has to be a solution that pleases everyone. From ducks and trees to yous and mes.
Marge,No!
Marge,"Homer, we haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks, the dog has eaten all its hair...And the fixtures won't stay in one place."
Marge,"I never thought I would say this, but I think we have to move."
Marge,But this is the east side.
Marge,"Occasionally, you might hear a faint roar..."
Marge,We can't sell the house. We can't live here. What are we going to do?
Marge,"...the shaking's so bad, all my omelets have become frittatas."
Marge,Quick! Someone perform CPR.
Marge,That's CCR!
Marge,How can you say that?
Marge,don't you see? He's pointing out how sexist men can be.
Marge,Those jets keep going lower and lower.
Marge,"Krusty, we're desperate here. We need you to turn your campaign around."
Marge,"Krusty, why did you just drop your pants?"
Marge,Election night is so exciting. I'm on pins and needles.
Marge,"There he is. Krusty, we came to see how many campaign promises you've kept."
Marge,No.
Marge,"No, let's hear him out. He looks a little like Walter Mondale."
Marge,But I didn't do anything.
Marge,This is so romantic.
Marge,"Homie, I'm sorry... you know I usually bring my A-game to the bedroom... but tonight I just can't throw the heat."
Marge,"You're so cute when you're begging for sex, but I'm just too tired."
Marge,Sounds good to me.
Marge,What's that ruckus?
Marge,"Oh, that's so sweet. I was tired of putting my keys in that bowl, like a cave man."
Marge,I didn't know Mr. Burns had an electric eel pond.
Marge,"Oh, Homie. Don't let it get you down. So Mr. Burns doesn't take you seriously? Big whoop! Who gives a doodle? Whoopie ding dong doo!"
Marge,So my husband goes to a bar every night. Whoop de doo. Who gives a bibble? Gabba gabba hey!
Marge,"Homie, what's wrong?"
Marge,"Well, if you don't know the right path to take, you have to be very quiet and listen for that little voice inside that tells you what to do."
Marge,"Bart, you can hear us?"
Marge,"Homie, I know you've got a lot of work to do. But this really isn't the same as eating dinner with your family."
Marge,Homie?
Marge,Uh-oh -- sounds like some bad eggs are cooking up trouble.
Marge,Live from New York it's Saturday Night!
Marge,"This is even better than our screensaver. And I love our screensaver. Nicely done, Lisa."
Marge,"Here it is, this week's family activity."
Marge,The box says it's the perfect way to spend a day. And why would a box lie to a person?
Marge,The first step is the funnest -- turning all the pieces face up.
Marge,"Turn it over, Homer."
Marge,"Ooh, look how late it is. Let's get you kids some coffee."
Marge,"Homer, no scissors!"
Marge,I can't believe our family finished a project this complicated.
Marge,"James Taylor. Homie, remember that song we used to sing?"
Marge,MOCK...
Marge,ING...
Marge,BIRD...
Marge,"Homie, what's wrong?"
Marge,"Oh, is this about that billboard my sisters put up?"
Marge,Huh?
Marge,"Oh my God, I forgot all about this. Where did you find it?"
Marge,"Homer, I'm sorry you saw that, but I was very upset that night."
Marge,"Well, I love you, of course. But a lot of things you do still drive me crazy."
Marge,"A little bit, yeah."
Marge,You made your own breakfast?
Marge,Looks like you had a problem with those scrambled eggs.
Marge,I'll fix you something.
Marge,"Well, there are a lot of beer cans around here."
Marge,"Homer, let it go. It's not always going to be perfect. We've been married for ten years."
Marge,Well this morning isn't a barrel of laughs.
Marge,Maybe if you didn't throw 'em on the floor...
Marge,"Don't worry, sweetie. Your father won't stay mad forever."
Marge,Your father sure can be thoughtful when he wants to be.
Marge,"Yes, Homie?"
Marge,Just go. And take your stupid Lhasa Apso with you.
Marge,"Lisa, marriage is a beautiful thing. But it's also a constant battle for moral superiority. So I can't apologize."
Marge,Bart! That's not right.
Marge,"Homie, I tried to tell you how I feel, but I can't find the right words. Maybe he can."
Marge,"Homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?"
Marge,"Goodbye, Homer! I try to save our marriage, and you just get drunk and spend the whole night with your homosexual boyfriends!"
Marge,"Reverend Lovejoy, Mrs. Lovejoy, Principal Skinner, Duffman."
Marge,And I still do.
Marge,"Well, you'll never have to."
Marge,"Homie, what are you thinking?"
Marge,"Nobody owns Christmas Carols. They belong to everyone, like grapes at the grocery store!"
Marge,"Another cover? My God, let it die."
Marge,I am so sick of that song!
Marge,Why don't we take a vacation and get away from that song for a while?
Marge,I still think you should have left that at the motel.
Marge,"Watch it, Mr. Byrne! You'll slip on the Simonize!"
Marge,I really don't want to do a lot of flip-de-loops.
Marge,"That was a delicious meal, Cookie. What do we do with our garbage?"
Marge,Why don't you just chase the beavers away?
Marge,I didn't gasp like that until I was eighteen!
Marge,"Shucks, Lisa. You sure have taken a shine to that cowpoke."
Marge,Don't rightly know. I just soaked up the lingo like a biscuit in a bucket full of gopher gravy. I'll stop now.
Marge,"Thir-what year old?!! Lisa, you're only eight."
Marge,"Lisa, you don't know what you'll want in the future. I didn't marry the first boy I... well, I did. But you shouldn't!"
Marge,Oh no! They're making beautiful music together!
Marge,"Homie, I'm worried about how fast our kids are growing up."
Marge,But they're already acting like teenagers. Lisa's with that boy... and look at Maggie!
Marge,"Homer, those are elk."
Marge,You're tellin' me.
Marge,"Lisa, welcome to love. It's full of doubt and pain and uncertainty. But then one day you find a man you love so much it hurts."
Marge,"You, Homie."
Marge,"Eh, we can spend another week at the ranch."
Marge,That treehouse is never gonna get built at this rate. Time to call in the pros.
Marge,The Amish are so industrious. Not like those shiftless Mennonites.
Marge,Family head-count!
Marge,"Pointy, pointy, spiky, stylish... Where's baldy?!"
Marge,"Homie, get out of that treehouse!"
Marge,There's no net!
Marge,"Stop it, Homer, that's inhumane! Use the choke chain!"
Marge,People do crazy things in ads... like eat at Arby's.
Marge,"Well, he's not yours anymore. You threw him out on Christmas Eve!"
Marge,That guy exploits his pets worse than Bob Guccione.
Marge,This is where Duffman lives now. But I'm not sure we should go in there.
Marge,"Give it a rest, Barry."
Marge,All we have left are the earthquake ham and the condolence ham.
Marge,That cat saved your life.
Marge,He woke you up when you stopped breathing last night.
Marge,"Okay kids, stay together!"
Marge,"Oh, a mom's work is never done."
Marge,"Bart, get out of there!"
Marge,My poor boy. Will he be all right?
Marge,My husband has our card...
Marge,"Well, it's eleven a.m. on a workday, so he must be at that stupid bar."
Marge,Is my husband there?
Marge,"Homie, where have you been? I've been calling all over for you!"
Marge,"Well from now on, you need to get a cell phone so I can reach you."
Marge,I guess I'll have to do all your driving chores. That's what a good wife does -- picks up the slack.
Marge,Why can't you use the local dry cleaner?
Marge,We'll see.
Marge,"Kids, hurry up and eat! We have to leave for the dentist five minutes ago!"
Marge,We don't have time for choking!
Marge,"I'm stressed because now that you've lost your license, I'm a full-time family chauffeur!"
Marge,To hell with the Livery Commission!
Marge,How could you both miss the bus to school?
Marge,What's all that rustling?
Marge,When will they stop?
Marge,Stop saying things!
Marge,"Hey, I'd like that. I can't. I have to go pick up Grampa... he proposed to another hooker at the bus station."
Marge,"I am so sorry, Homie. How is your crushed pelvis?"
Marge,I don't know what happened. I saw you and I went for the brake but I hit the accelerator!
Marge,"That's okay. I can handle it. Homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup?"
Marge,I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Marge,"Oh, you're really coming along, Homie."
Marge,"Gee, everything always works out for you."
Marge,Oh my God! Let me help you up!
Marge,What? That's crazy.
Marge,"That's ridiculous. I don't like you. I mean hate you, hate you, hate you! I hate you!"
Marge,Maybe we should see a counselor.
Marge,I've been married to my husband for ten years and part of me wants to kill him.
Marge,I'm really touched by how much you care.
Marge,"That's us in a nutshell. I care so much about you, Homer, but I'm not even on your list. Excuse me."
Marge,Lousy Homer... I'll show him... tonight his beloved mock apple pie will have real apples.
Marge,Wha...?!
Marge,Oh my God. It's so beautiful.
Marge,"Oh Homie, you got everyone in Springfield here for me!"
Marge,What?
Marge,"Ooo, the Pretender!"
Marge,"I love you, too."
Marge,Only with kisses.
Marge,"Oh, don't be a wuss."
Marge,I want to thank you all so much.
Marge,What?!
Marge,"Kids, that cartoon's not life-affirming. We're going to watch a show about the everyday problems of angels."
Marge,"Ned, I am so sorry."
Marge,I am so tired of that tautology.
Marge,"You are so right, Ned. There won't be a single minute where Bart's not under the watchful eye of myself or... Homer, get over here!"
Marge,"Here are some supervised activities we can all do together. Future Veterans of Foreign Wars, The 5-H Club..."
Marge,They had to admit homosexuals.
Marge,"You won't be seeing Milhouse for a while. Something about that boy just shakes up your soda. Ooh, this looks interesting: The Pre-Teen Braves."
Marge,Just like real Indians!
Marge,"Yeah, Indians don't sit around drinking beer and watching TV."
Marge,"Well, thank you. I'm gonna make sure you boys have the best possible Pre-Teen Brave experience."
Marge,"Nelson, leggings?"
Marge,Let's admire Nelson's love of nature.
Marge,All right. Everyone inside. Let's go.
Marge,Our nature walk will be hosted by a full-blooded Native American. Say hello to Jim Proudfoot from the Mohican tribe.
Marge,What are we gonna do to that field?
Marge,Yay!
Marge,"Let's go, boys. Make sure you use Pine Sol on those pine trees, for that pine fresh smell."
Marge,"Oh for God's sake, I can see why he left. Now all of you, get cleaning."
Marge,"Well, surely there's room in this town for two well-meaning juvenile associations."
Marge,Then I guess this means war.
Marge,Those Cavalry Kids are bigger credit hogs than the Red Cross.
Marge,Well you ain't seen nothin' till you've seen the Pre-Teen Braves.
Marge,Exactly. The Pre-Teen Braves.
Marge,This is a perfect opportunity. We'll beat those Cavalry Kids by selling candy!
Marge,All I wanted was to glue feathers on felt and teach the boys good citizenship. And now it's a donnybrook!
Marge,"No, there were twelve."
Marge,"Bart, plants don't-- wheww!"
Marge,My baby!
Marge,"Moe, I'm glad you're here! I wanted to thank you so much for saving my baby, so I knitted you a nice warm sweater."
Marge,"No, no all that's in there is love and gratitude."
Marge,"Oh, Lord. Why do they keep changing his medication?"
Marge,"Moe, I gotta handle this. Can you keep an eye on Maggie?"
Marge,"No, you'll be fine. I'll be right back."
Marge,"Grampa, stop!"
Marge,"Oh, Lord."
Marge,"Hmp, I finally caught up with Grampa. I found him crying in the cemetery. Thanks for taking care of Maggie."
Marge,"Wow, she really likes you. Maybe the next time I need a sitter, and you're not busy..."
Marge,"Well, I have so much free time now that Moe's our babysitter."
Marge,"Oh, a rattle!"
Marge,"Thank you, Selma."
Marge,I don't know if toy drunkards are an appropriate gift for a baby.
Marge,"No, it's your turn."
Marge,You have your own baby monitor in our child's room?
Marge,"Now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender."
Marge,Maggie's gone!
Marge,No! We have to find my baby!
Marge,"Okay, you can help us."
Marge,You guys are the world's worst cops.
Marge,Here's a clue: a discarded orange wedge!
Marge,All the time. Sometimes I bring them lemonade.
Marge,Maggie's right in the middle of that Italian-American-Mexican standoff!
Marge,"Thanks, Moe. I'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper."
Marge,"I don't think Maggie wants you out of her life, Moe."
Marge,Will everyone please stop fighting and burning!
Marge,"Homie, I disagree with your approach to the children."
Marge,"Bart, run like the wind!"
Marge,"Well, I've only read it in books."
Marge,"Homer, it's trash day. Will you just take him out to the curb?"
Marge,"Thanks for not killing me, Homie. Here's an extra pork chop."
Marge,This is more violent than the Hip Hop Awards. You've got to stop your father!
Marge,"Ooh baby! Did I find something to throw out today! If you like space in the attic, are you gonna be happy!"
Marge,"Lisa, that's a filthy habit."
Marge,Why is Bart so tall? And shaggy?
Marge,It's too nice a day to be outside doing chores. Come in and watch TV.
Marge,"I'm not fooling around, people! Park your keisters in front of that TV! Now!"
Marge,Ta-da!
Marge,No thanks. I'm wearing my cure for depression.
Marge,My heart is fine.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Win your own T-shirt!
Marge,"Oh, relax. I'm sure it's just your brain going crazy."
Marge,Don't tell me you're actually going.
Marge,"You always go with your gut. This time, why don't you listen to your brain?"
Marge,You stole this entire room from Ned Flanders' house!
Marge,Thanks for the meatloaf recipe. I claim it as my own.
Marge,"Homer, it's two in the morning."
Marge,"Okay, Homie. If it makes you feel better, I think your Mom's all right, too."
Marge,I really shouldn't be here -- I have a problem with games of chance. I played Candyland with Maggie and ended up throwing vodka in her face.
Marge,Bet... system... betting system! God is telling me to gamble!
Marge,Deal! Hit me! Hit me! Hit me! Busted!
Marge,I'm so proud of you Lisa.
Marge,"Honey, you could be popular, you've just got to be yourself... in a whole new way."
Marge,Where did you get that tutu?
Marge,"You're like Geraldine Ferraro, except you won, where she failed miserably."
Marge,"Lisa, you look so successful. Like you're the wife of a businessman."
Marge,"Oh, isn't that sweet? Even your brother's adding his kudos."
Marge,You were?
Marge,"Principal Skinner, can't you just reinstate those programs?"
Marge,"Lisa, what are you doing? This is the kind of troublemaking I expect from your brother."
Marge,"Well, couldn't you just hang some colorful crepe paper in the gym?"
Marge,Those Fudruckers!
Marge,"Oh no, they heard me."
Marge,Which means someone lost it. You'll have to put up flyers and see if anyone claims it.
Marge,"That's the last of them. You did the right thing, Bart, and now you can keep the money."
Marge,Well... someday I'd like to go on a nice vacation.
Marge,"Yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and I don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon."
Marge,"Oh, forget it. Bart, don't waste your money on me."
Marge,"A subscription to ""BartForum"" magazine, , and Bart will say ""eat my shorts"" on your home answering machine."
Marge,That sounds great -- But only if your father promises to behave.
Marge,Tony... I mean Mr. Prime Minister... what should we see first?
Marge,England is so classy. Every cab has its own butler.
Marge,You punched out three people on the street.
Marge,Do you understand any part of what you just said?
Marge,"Homie, I don't think we'll be able to find the kids from up here."
Marge,"Oh, look at all these classy British plays."
Marge,Bart! Stop saying Macbeth!
Marge,"Homie, you're doing a great job driving on the left. This is turning out to be our most enjoyable trip ever."
Marge,"Turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning..."
Marge,"No, it's too risky! We'll just wait till the traffic thins out. Turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning..."
Marge,What difference could it make? He hit the friggin' Queen!
Marge,I guess it's just too much for me to ask for one vacation where we don't go to jail or to a condo sales pitch.
Marge,"Bart, you're not helping."
Marge,"It's partly my fault. I've been nagging you so much on this trip, you couldn't know which nags to focus on."
Marge,"Homer, you couldn't be in more trouble. They're going to put your head on a pike. They're practicing with melons."
Marge,"That was very sweet of the Queen, letting you go in exchange for taking Madonna back to America."
Marge,Englishwomen don't pump gas naked!
Marge,All this attention! I feel like a secretary on Administrative Professionals Day!
Marge,"""Kitchen Carnival?"" I love it! Thank you, Homie."
Marge,"Homer, are you spooning that snack?"
Marge,"Homie, it's time you got rid of that thing. All that candy is rotting your brain."
Marge,Homie! What happened to you?
Marge,But seeing you like this is more than I can bear.
Marge,"Oh, dear Lord."
Marge,"Homer, there's no rear on that thing."
Marge,"Now look here, mister. I forbid you to fight a bear."
Marge,"You're not going, and that's final."
Marge,"Lisa, I think your father just left!"
Marge,I've got a bad feeling about this. Let's check the suit closet.
Marge,That man and his foolish pride! We've gotta go follow him.
Marge,"Mr. Connor, thank you for helping find my husband. I don't want my last words to him to be ""clip your toenails, they look like Fritos."""
Marge,Is there any sign of my husband?
Marge,"It's Homer, don't shoot!"
Marge,"Well, I'm proud of you, Homie."
Marge,You set out to fight an animal and you ended up saving its life.
Marge,Maggie's locked inside!
Marge,How did you get her out?
Marge,Dr. Hibbert? Is someone seriously ill?
Marge,We did -- Homer took him. Didn't you?
Marge,Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Marge,You and Lisa better go find homes for these puppies -- and don't just dump them all off on some crazy lady.
Marge,"How about Jon Stewart? He's a son, a lover and a pundit rolled into one sexy package."
Marge,My husband's a power-mad star.
Marge,Maybe now we can get that padding that goes under rugs.
Marge,"Oh, Homie, you may have lost your show, but you went out in the classiest way possible. I'm proud of you."
Marge,"Come on, Homie. We'll go to the ""Make Your Own Sundae"" place."
Marge,Yes.
Marge,They're not getting married!
Marge,That's the rich people's mall. Let's shop till we droop!
Marge,"That's a very violent image, Lisa."
Marge,I think these are my Homie's size...
Marge,"Excuse me, can I ask you a favor?"
Marge,Perfect! I'll take it.
Marge,What a mall!
Marge,Isn't it kind of dry?
Marge,"Homer, is there something you're not telling us?"
Marge,What's that?
Marge,You wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself!
Marge,"You just don't get it, do you? Christmas is a time to think of others, but today you showed you only care about yourself."
Marge,You can sleep on the couch tonight.
Marge,"No. I'm gonna parcel my anger out over the next few days and weeks, jabbing at you just when you seem the most content."
Marge,That last one looked kinda good.
Marge,You've made that promise before.
Marge,I've dreamed of the day you'd say that!
Marge,"Oh, your thoughtfulness tastes so good. And tears are the sweetest sauce."
Marge,"Homie, I'm so proud -- you changed more than I could imagined! You're even covering your mouth when you burp."
Marge,"Look, Maggie. A show for babies."
Marge,"Well, Maggie likes Roofi. And babies only like good things."
Marge,"Ou-ay ow-knay, I-ay as-way oung-yay unce-way oo-tay."
Marge,It's on batteries.
Marge,Backed up by solar power.
Marge,"Aw, look how happy she is."
Marge,It makes her happy.
Marge,I got the Roofi tickets!
Marge,I got them fair and square and I kept my dignity. Not like Janey's mom.
Marge,Whatever.
Marge,This concert is oversold. It's as if a music promoter acted unscrupulously!
Marge,"They make the Blue Man Group look like Mummenschanz, which is still pretty good. Oh. The second one wants custard, too. That's a little repetitive."
Marge,"Oh no, it's raining! And Maggie's diapers are extra-absorbent!"
Marge,"Excuse me, everyone. I'm a mother."
Marge,And I'm an American!
Marge,I bake apple pies!
Marge,And I love baseball!
Marge,"Then how would we ever get to see ""Camelot""?"
Marge,"Is that better? To me, Ralph Wiggum is Sir Lancelot."
Marge,"Ms. Naegle, I'm sorry to surprise you like this, but I thought if we met face-to-face, we could settle our differences."
Marge,I'll cut to the chase. I brought with me the very best reason I can think of for what I believe in.
Marge,Her name is Lisa. And I wouldn't trade her for all the sleep-in Sundays and speed dating in the world.
Marge,Then wait in the shadows!
Marge,"Then, I guess this means war. With the most powerful weapon at my disposal: a voter-sponsored initiative."
Marge,I've already drawn up the petition.
Marge,"No, the March primary."
Marge,We've got pretzels at home.
Marge,"Attention, everyone."
Marge,I wish to announce the formation of PPASSCCATAG: Proud Parents Against Singles Seniors Childless Couples and Teens And Gays.
Marge,"To overturn these horrible anti-family laws, we've prepared the ""Families Come First"" initiative. Now, the first thing we're gonna need is money."
Marge,Save our families! Sign our Petition!
Marge,But I haven't endorsed it yet!
Marge,Forget it.
Marge,I guess no one gives a damn about the American family anymore.
Marge,Mr. Burns? You care about children?
Marge,That ad makes me look like a criminal.
Marge,That wasn't me!
Marge,Three!
Marge,I try my best. They ridicule me. They mock everything I cherish.
Marge,"You're my rock, Homie."
Marge,Awww...
Marge,What are you going to do?
Marge,I always keep one near the bed for you.
Marge,I probably should have watched it first.
Marge,"It says ""Yes on two thirty-two"". We want no on two thirty-two, Yes on two forty-two."
Marge,"And the bumper stickers misspelled ""on""."
Marge,"They say ""Yes No two forty-two"". And it's the night before the election and you haven't handed them out!"
Marge,I need to be alone right now.
Marge,"Looks like everything's back the way it was, which is the only way it should ever be."
Marge,I said no!
Marge,It's no! His old bike is fine!
Marge,When Bad Things Happen To Cute Children says that a new pet will pull you out of your sorrow cycle.
Marge,"Oh, it's very wise. It's written by a rabbi -- who surfs!"
Marge,"Oh, Lisa. Honey, it's okay. You're a Buddhist, so you know your cats are now reincarnated as a higher form of life."
Marge,"Coltrane? Lisa, I'm glad you're ready to love again. But a kitty needs a proper name, like Whiskers. Or Paws Scaggs."
Marge,You should be glad I did. Your father wanted to call you Bartzeena!
Marge,"And Lord, if you think I'm making lemon bars for your bake sale Sunday, you'd better stop killing our cats."
Marge,It's the only way to talk to bullies.
Marge,"My job was to keep Lisa's hope alive. But instead, she's really depressed."
Marge,"Business, what business?"
Marge,"Well, I could use a muffin."
Marge,"Esme Delacroix! She wrote ""To Kiss a Scoundrel!"""
Marge,"Marge Simpson, long-time reader, first-time stander-upper... did you have any special training to become a writer?"
Marge,"Anyone? If I write a book, will they tell me when it comes out?"
Marge,Then I'll do it!
Marge,You work at the nuclear plant.
Marge,Tonight? But I was hoping you could watch the kids while I work on my novel.
Marge,"Homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call."
Marge,I know -- I got your message.
Marge,I'm writing a novel!
Marge,Thank you!
Marge,Hmm... what should I write about?
Marge,That painting has always sparked my imagination.
Marge,That's it. A novel about whaling -- that's something you haven't seen before. Thank you...
Marge,Scene From Moby-Dick.
Marge,"""Chapter One: Starts and Beginnings."" ""Swim, swim, swim, thought the whale, flapping his... floppers."" Brownie break!"
Marge,"""...Mayor Quimby, Disco Stu, and our fighting men and women overseas."" Well, I finished the ""thank yous,"" time to go back to the novel."
Marge,Temperance Barrows stared at the sea like a dog stares at a ham...
Marge,"Ooh, I just finished my first paragraph. Spell check!"
Marge,"Perfect! Now, let's see if lightning strikes twice!"
Marge,"For Temperance, the days passed on... as did seven of her ten children."
Marge,"Oh Homie, I've had the most exciting day..."
Marge,Fine. Right after this revision!
Marge,Temperance had to face the unhappy truth...
Marge,...she had married a brute.
Marge,"This story is as dark as those new Milky Way bars. Ooh, that's a good analogy. I'll work it in somewhere. But now I need some romance, pronto!"
Marge,"Ned, that's so considerate."
Marge,"Boy, when you write you can let your imagination run wild. ""Temperance was doing the laundry..."""
Marge,What do you know? It is!
Marge,"I'm finished! And it's so suggestive. But like they say, ""snuggling sells."" Now, do I dare push ""print?"""
Marge,"Well, what do you think?"
Marge,What do you mean? My book is set in whaling times.
Marge,"Well, I guess that part is loosely based on your father."
Marge,I suppose I better. Your father's a very private person.
Marge,"Homie, I finished my novel."
Marge,It's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.
Marge,It's double-spaced.
Marge,Well?
Marge,Did you read the book?
Marge,Did you like it?
Marge,Oh that's wonderful. And the characters didn't bother you at all?
Marge,And you're fine with me trying to get it published?
Marge,Oh Homie!
Marge,Hello?
Marge,Dr. Marvin Monroe?! I haven't seen you in years.
Marge,The Harpooned Heart II: Thunder Down Under. Chapter One. Temperance Barrows stared at the shrimp on the barbie...
Marge,You told me you liked it! You didn't read it at all! You lied to me!
Marge,Well... there is a place called Nantucket.
Marge,It was only my imagination.
Marge,"""As Temperance watched the two men she had loved and the one whale she admired disappear into the ocean, she realized it was... the end."""
Marge,"Please Homie, don't hurt him!"
Marge,"Oh, Homie! You're trying to improve yourself, and it's because of my book."
Marge,That's the best review I've gotten. Seriously. These reviews are terrible.
Marge,"Jack Ruby was a man, not a jewel."
Marge,"There, there, I can help you kids."
Marge,I know a little something about history. Gather 'round.
Marge,"Henry the Eighth had everything he could want, except a son to follow in his footsteps..."
Marge,"Finally, Henry's daughter Elizabeth became Queen. England's power was never greater, and British actresses always had a role to play when they got to a certain age."
Marge,"No problem! In elementary school, we girls learned about Sacagawea while the boys were learning math!"
Marge,"In 1804, President Jefferson..."
Marge,...sent Lewis and Clark and some embedded journalists to find the Northwest Passage.
Marge,They paddled up the Mississippi from St. Louis...
Marge,"When winter came, Lewis and Clark tried to set up camp, but encountered much hardship."
Marge,"Come spring, they sought help from the Native Americans."
Marge,"And today, Lewis' promise has been fulfilled."
Marge,"No, it's a Sacagawea dollar. You can trade it in at the bank for a real dollar! Eh?"
Marge,"Bart, what famous historical figure do you want to write about?"
Marge,"C'mon, Bart -- we can make this fun. History's like an amusement park, except instead of rides, you have dates to memorize."
Marge,Boring? Is there anything boring about a bad-ass rocker who lived fast and died young?
Marge,"As a young prodigy, this popular musician wowed audiences across eighteenth-century Europe..."
Marge,And that's the life of Mozart. Thank God he died young. I've gotta get dinner on the stove.
Marge,Why are your clothes so dirty? And why do you smell like liquor? Have you been clubbing?
Marge,"Homie, they're beautiful. That Chevron station has the most romantic bouquets! I feel a swoon coming on... Here it is!"
Marge,"Well, I'm sure he'll be happy you came."
Marge,"Bart honey, it's a nice day. Why don't you play outside?"
Marge,"You know, I think your sister could use a little help washing the car."
Marge,You'll be like an owl saying Milhouse who? Milhouse who? Milhouse whooo?
Marge,"Homie, I'd like to know what you've been doing after work."
Marge,I also found this in your drawer.
Marge,Are these Diamondique?
Marge,Diamondelle?
Marge,Cubic Diamondium?
Marge,Dioxy-ribo-diamondoid?
Marge,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
Marge,We finally have something to put in the wall safe.
Marge,Hostess Twinkies?
Marge,Kids?
Marge,"Go ride bikes for a while, huh."
Marge,"Listen, Mr. Hobo. You may not have laundry to wash, but I do. Now what do you want to show me?"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,You're panhandling! I should have known from that panhandling sign! Plus that ticket you got for panhandling.
Marge,"Homer, I don't need fancy things. And even if I did, this is the wrong way to get them."
Marge,"And to remind you of what you've done, I'm going to keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions."
Marge,"Well, then maybe you need to buy me a brooch."
Marge,What's all that racket?!
Marge,That's a lot of pressure to put on a baby. All they should be worried about is the raspberry monster.
Marge,Maggie!
Marge,Maggie doesn't talk yet.
Marge,"Oh no no, she says lots of words. Like when she wants something, she says"
Marge,My baby has no future!
Marge,Grocers don't make that much.
Marge,"And even then, he could only speak German!"
Marge,All our children are smart. Some are just smarter than the others.
Marge,"Maggie, I can't believe how much stuff your new school sent over!"
Marge,"Look at these courses you'll be taking. ""Advanced Peek-a-boo""."
Marge,'Got Your Nose' And Other Lies...
Marge,"Look Lisa, there's something in here for you!"
Marge,"And Maggie gets a shirt, too!"
Marge,"Sweetie, you seem so blue. Did the last of something die?"
Marge,"Well, I know who you are. And here's something to help you never forget!"
Marge,"Well, then... find a new identity."
Marge,Lisa!
Marge,You were purposely teaching her the wrong word!
Marge,"Lisa, I'm surprised. Your sister just wants to learn and be like you. Well, maybe she needs a better role model."
Marge,Lisa's gone! You have to find her!
Marge,But she's only eight!
Marge,"Fine. ""Extremely Satisfied."""
Marge,I hope this typeface catches people's eye. It sure didn't move our old fondue set!
Marge,Where'd you find these?
Marge,"Oh my God, what?"
Marge,Lisa... Lisa...
Marge,"Oh God, we're in a belly. Everyone take off your shoes."
Marge,How do we get out?
Marge,Lisa! You're all right!
Marge,Just tell her which friggin' button to push!
Marge,Uh-hmm.
Marge,"You took little children to ""The Re-Deadening""?!"
Marge,"Homer, this is a rare lapse in judgment for you."
Marge,"Honey, I know you're scared. But there's no boogie woogies or wooly bullies out there."
Marge,"Oh, your nightlight's burned out. And the only bulbs we have left are these red ones."
Marge,"Homie, that Kojak is sexier than Cannon and Barnaby Jones put together. I think he looks a little like you."
Marge,"How about a little ""interrogation?"""
Marge,Good. Can you play with him for half an hour?
Marge,Artie Ziff!
Marge,No we didn't.
Marge,No you didn't.
Marge,Artie Ziff! Why are you living in our attic?
Marge,We had one date. And you were not a gentleman.
Marge,"I don't know, Artie..."
Marge,I thought you were playing catch with Artie.
Marge,"Oh my. Well, Homer, maybe you should take him to Moe's."
Marge,I'm not.
Marge,My husband's going to jail and it's all your fault! Do you know why no one likes you?
Marge,No. Your problem is you never think of anyone besides yourself.
Marge,I never want you in this house again!
Marge,"Oh, what do you think?"
Marge,"Okay kids, this book should help you deal with your feelings."
Marge,Daddy's not on fire.
Marge,"Okay, fine, he is."
Marge,I'm so happy to be getting my husband back.
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"Artie, thank you for doing the right thing. Eventually."
Marge,"Kids, you'd better take your last look at Uncle Artie."
Marge,"Kids, why don't you write a complaint letter? That's how I got the Channel Six weather girl to start wearing a bra."
Marge,"Well, northern California is wine country -- we could take a tour."
Marge,"Enjoy your tour, and take it easy on Mr. Curtis. Your father and I will be across the street at The Lush Valley Winery."
Marge,"We should do more together. You're my best friend, Homie."
Marge,"The doctor said if you tried running again, your ankles would shatter."
Marge,"Mmm, it goes great with the Jolly Rancher I'm sucking on!"
Marge,"Stop it, Seinfeld."
Marge,"Don't tell mama what mama don't like. Come here, you big lug!"
Marge,"Homie, to store the extra wine we bought, I made a little wine cellar."
Marge,"Well, I've been using it for laundry soap, but, okay."
Marge,"Homie, you are so cute."
Marge,I don't talk like that.
Marge,"Well, you talk like Marge, sorry I set the bed on fire."
Marge,"Moe's Tavern? That's your fun place, like me and the lamp store."
Marge,"No, it'll have to do."
Marge,"The best part is, I don't have to ask your father where he was all night, because I was there!"
Marge,"Oh, my head!"
Marge,Do you have to make such an unholy racket?
Marge,Maybe we should put this booze cruise in dry dock for a while.
Marge,Okay... and maybe you could cut back too.
Marge,I hope I can still have fun while everyone else is drinking.
Marge,"Well, I don't want to be a ""Gloom-Hilda."" I guess one beer won't hurt."
Marge,Isn't that a little big?
Marge,Have you ever walked on stilts? It's not that great.
Marge,"Eh, why do people worry about stuff?... it's all gonna work out."
Marge,Are we home yet?
Marge,Oh no! I'm gonna be incarce... incarce... incarce... I'm going to jail.
Marge,I can't believe I drove drunk.
Marge,I don't know what to believe anymore.
Marge,Just take me home.
Marge,I'm not a drunk!
Marge,This is a pamphlet for chimney sweeping.
Marge,"My drinking problem is out of control. At Oktoberfest, all I could think about was beer! I couldn't even celebrate... the harvest."
Marge,"Look, I'm not sure this place is working. The drinkers are smoking, the smokers are drinking, and the gamblers are having sex with everything that moves."
Marge,Get away from me!
Marge,Homer?
Marge,You let me believe that I'd done such a terrible thing?
Marge,I can't believe you did that to me.
Marge,I am so cheesed off. I need a drink!
Marge,Pour me another.
Marge,"Well, I feel a buzz, but I don't feel happier. It's not like when I was drinking with Homer."
Marge,"Hey, you're right! What I enjoyed was spending time with my husband."
Marge,"Well, I love my husband and I'm glad I do. My name is Marge S. And I'm a Homer-holic!"
Marge,"I'm afraid what I like can't be swallowed, sniffed or smoked."
Marge,"Thanks for everything, Kyle."
Marge,"Homie, I want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking."
Marge,"Well, that's no promise at all!"
Marge,It's important for me to see you take at least one step. Then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur.
Marge,Really? Even Zima?
Marge,You really mean it?
Marge,"Homer, before you get anywhere near the escalator, you've got to tie those shoes. Homer!"
Marge,No.
Marge,He's eating my beauty!
Marge,I hope he didn't have children. Did he have children?
Marge,That doesn't look so big.
Marge,Six feet by eight?
Marge,No! You're not going to take my baby to jail!
Marge,My baby boy is in jail! I'm the worst mom in the world.
Marge,"Now sweetie, you shouldn't hang around with people who beat you. They're not true friends."
Marge,But he won't know where to go or what to eat.
Marge,"Oh Bart, my troubled little lamb. You'll be in jail for so long. But I'll keep your room just the way it was: a pigsty."
Marge,"We're having ""make your own taco"" night."
Marge,Would you like to join us?
Marge,"Homie, what are you doing?"
Marge,You're getting acid in the bed!
Marge,I'm gonna sleep on the couch.
Marge,"Ooo, sexy drinks, adult board games..."
Marge,I'm glad I sent the kids to Grampa's to protect their innocent minds.
Marge,Principal Skinner is having second thoughts? Poor Edna!
Marge,Every day you find a new way to aggravate me.
Marge,Spice up! Spice up!
Marge,"Principal Skinner, I feel so bad for you."
Marge,This is so sad.
Marge,"No, I'm here to have a little girl-talk with Mrs. Krabappel."
Marge,"So, how are you holdin' up?"
Marge,"Oh, passion's for teens and immigrants. I'm just glad to have someone to look at when I wake up in the morning."
Marge,Well...
Marge,Sure there are downsides. But a relationship can't be all hand-holding and restaurant desserts.
Marge,"Well, it's... in my case... hmm."
Marge,You just say...
Marge,"Oh, that's so lovely. But it's too late to win us back with sweet talk!"
Marge,"I won't let Edna throw her life away for some passionless marriage where two people lie in bed together with no contact, whittling away the batteries until they die."
Marge,"Let's just say in an emergency, I wouldn't count on either one."
Marge,"Edna's with Comic Book Guy? Oh God, she's on the rebound! And you meet the worst guys on the rebound. It's how Jackie got her ""O""!"
Marge,I wish you'd devote this much time and attention to our relationship.
Marge,"They're all too old to be dressed up like super-people. Homer, let's just hurry up and go home so I can yell at you."
Marge,Yeah! You don't need a husband to be happy!
Marge,I'm afraid this time a coat of whitewash won't cover it.
Marge,Our marriage is just an illusion. He doesn't care how I feel at all. He doesn't know how to love.
Marge,"Oh, it's very sweet, but I don't need..."
Marge,Where's that coming from?
Marge,A band in a closet! Every girl's dream.
Marge,I do!
Marge,Shame on you two creeps!
Marge,"Stop it! No one was planned! Now, we have to pack for Great-Uncle Tyrone's birthday tomorrow. In Dayton!"
Marge,"Dayton, Ohio!"
Marge,It's got Wright-Patterson Airforce Base and a zipper museum! They have a zipper from every James Bond!
Marge,"We're staying at the Dayton Arms Hotel. It got three Diamonds from ""Five Diamond"" magazine!"
Marge,"All right, kids, you don't have to go. But I insist we do something tonight as a family. We'll play board games, put photos in an album, measure how much you've grown..."
Marge,"Well, I-I... let's just rent a movie."
Marge,"What I want is a really good ""weeper."""
Marge,THE SWEET LOVE STORY THAT IS OLDER THAN THE SEA...
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"Opinion noted. Now if you don't mind, your father and I are trying to lose ourselves in this romantic fantasy."
Marge,"Homie, if I died, would you be sad?"
Marge,"Oh, Homie."
Marge,"Bart, stop fooling with the remote!"
Marge,Stupid kids ruin everything.
Marge,"Homie, you know I'm usually good for a triple-X throw down, but between those kids and going to Uncle Tyrone's, we can't be alone."
Marge,It's their hub.
Marge,"Homie, look at them!"
Marge,"Honeymooners -- no kids, no worries."
Marge,"You know, if we were younger and crazier, we'd trade in these tickets and run off to Miami!"
Marge,What about Uncle Tyrone?
Marge,We're ditching our kids and taking a second honeymoon!
Marge,And we're blowing off Uncle Tyrone's birthday!
Marge,So much for getting my groove back.
Marge,This is so luxurious! I feel like I'm Princess Grace and Princess Di smashed together!
Marge,No!
Marge,"Hi, sweetie. We're just calling to check in."
Marge,Right here in Dayton.
Marge,Yup. It's really boring. You kids would have hated it.
Marge,"Oh, you know, typical boring Dayton weather!"
Marge,"No, no. That's the noise the phone makes when you've been on too long. Bye now! Love you."
Marge,"Yeah, I've never sat by a pool this long without having to apologize to someone."
Marge,Here's to life without children!
Marge,The kids tracked us down! Our romantic holiday just became a stinkin' family vacation.
Marge,"You're right, but where do we go?"
Marge,Step on it!
Marge,"Homie, people in the other elevators can see us."
Marge,"Oh my God, Homie! Look!"
Marge,"That boy failed show and tell, but he's on our ass like Sherlock Holmes."
Marge,"Homie, the waiter's still here."
Marge,Would you two just shut up!!
Marge,"Sure, we lied. We lied so we could spend a single night as a married couple without worrying about you kids!"
Marge,"You win, kids. Just sleep here tonight and we'll all go back to Springfield tomorrow."
Marge,And nobody does it better.
Marge,We understand perfectly well!
Marge,"I don't know... Homie, why don't we just go home, wait 'til the kids fall asleep, and have sex in the car?"
Marge,You've been to space.
Marge,"Shut up and kiss me, you doomed hunk!"
Marge,More alive than any of you squares!
Marge,"Get ready, skanks -- here comes the truth train!"
Marge,How about a bite of the world's biggest Brussels sprout?
Marge,Let's see how your sister's doing in the place-setting competition.
Marge,"Where were you, Homie? You missed all the excitement."
Marge,You can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking.
Marge,"Ooh, I'll bet he's Ned Flanders."
Marge,I'm not being trampled. What gives?
Marge,Listen... I'm married.
Marge,"I'm looking up your nose, but I feel like I'm staring into your soul."
Marge,"That was so exciting, yet familiar. Like Coke with lemon."
Marge,"Oh, me too..."
Marge,Homie... are you the Pie Man?
Marge,"Well, whoever he is, the Pie Man would never cave in to blackmail."
Marge,"Now, on a different subject, kiss me hard."
Marge,I don't care.
Marge,"I know one person who believes you were the Pie Man, Homie... me. I've known it all along."
Marge,"No, it was clearly you in that suit. You'd have to be an idiot not to see it from the start."
Marge,"So... Pie Man, why don't you show me your superpowers? Pie Man?"
Marge,"While you two are up on the roof, why don't you take the leaves out of the gutter!"
Marge,"Stop it, Homer! There's only one way to settle this -- in Simpson family court."
Marge,I got the idea from a now-discredited book on raising children.
Marge,Your father's first kiss was in high school -- with me.
Marge,"Homer, that girl was me!"
Marge,"Yes... and then your father broke my heart. And if I'd known he was you, I never would have married you!"
Marge,You're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while.
Marge,"I'll start from the beginning. The girls' camp was focused on teaching etiquette and deportment. Now that I've captured your interest, let me continue..."
Marge,I used to walk like this all the time... until my tendon snapped. They heard it in Shelbyville!
Marge,Anyhoo... one night we had a special dinner.
Marge,We were learning to use all thirty-three forks.
Marge,I told my friends I had a date...
Marge,Uggams!
Marge,"Now, I'm gonna warn you kids: the next part of the story gets a little ""W-B""..."
Marge,It was as satisfying as a million Hallmark cards with all the right-sized envelopes.
Marge,But then your father showed his true colors.
Marge,"So we arranged to meet again at ""Second Date Rock."""
Marge,It was years before I could trust a boy again.
Marge,I guess so.
Marge,"Homer, when you nurse a hurt for thirty years, it doesn't go away in an instant."
Marge,"No, Homer."
Marge,"No, Homer."
Marge,"No, Homer."
Marge,"Homie, I know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love. I guess it didn't mean that much to you."
Marge,I wish there was some way I could believe that.
Marge,"Oh, Homie! You did care."
Marge,I kept my heart too.
Marge,"No, as a reminder of the hurtful things men can do."
Marge,But now it can have a second meaning.
Marge,"Oh, Elvis."
Marge,"How's the ice cream, kids?"
Marge,Who's ready for a kitten?
Marge,"Oh, you children are too suspicious. It's go time."
Marge,Bart! That hobo skeleton is not a toy!
Marge,"Now, that wasn't so bad, was it Bart? You know, sometimes the fear of some..."
Marge,"Stop it, Homer!"
Marge,I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY HOME FROM SCHOOL TOMORROW.
Marge,I swear Bart didn't know what he was doing. He was deaf!
Marge,"If there's one way to get the truth out, it's on a cable news channel."
Marge,"When we explain our side of the story, the hate calls will end. I won't have to hear ""suck my such and such"" or ""hell this"" and ""bitch that..."""
Marge,"Well, America's not perfect--"
Marge,"If by us you mean loud-mouthed talk show hosts, which everyone seems to be in this country, then yes, I do hate Americans!"
Marge,I'll have you know I am very well liked in Springfield.
Marge,"Homeland Noodles with Uncle Sam balls? Apu, aren't you going a bit overboard with the patriotism?"
Marge,Uh oh. Poonam and Uma are fighting!
Marge,I can't believe they put us in jail.
Marge,"Well, let's see, after they blindfolded us, it was left, right, left... then a three hour plane ride."
Marge,"You were right, Homie. We shouldn't have rocked the boat. Then none of this would have ever happened."
Marge,I don't know why they put the real ones in with the joke ones.
Marge,"Lisa, that's not funny. You believe in the Bill of Rights."
Marge,"Homer, we've got to get outta here."
Marge,"OKAY, KIDS SHOW OFF YOUR PIPES..."
Marge,WAIT RIGHT HERE FOR OUR ENCORE...
Marge,Does everyone remember their swimming lessons?
Marge,There's a ship! We're saved!
Marge,"Oh, I've always wanted to go to France. Your women don't age -- like Catherine Deneuve."
Marge,The food is so delicious here. And these Chanel suits are five for a dollar! I'm using a jacket as a napkin.
Marge,"And yet, I miss America."
Marge,"I wish we could go back, but I don't think we're welcome there."
Marge,"I think I'm going to like this ""America."""
Marge,You don't sell roadside corn.
Marge,I can't believe that historic rock is gone.
Marge,Why don't you publish your poem?
Marge,"Look at you go. Type-ity type, type, type!"
Marge,Some anniversary this is.
Marge,Hello? Octopuses? I'm done.
Marge,"Homer, what are you doing?"
Marge,"Homer, I am so mad at you! I'll bet you blew up the town just to get out of cleaning the garage!"
Marge,"Yeah, well, the joke's on you, smart guy. The garage made it to Heaven too!"
Marge,That sounds like Maggie. But she's right here...
Marge,Marge!
Marge,Why is my swimsuit so revealing?
Marge,Where'd you get that rib?
Marge,"Bart, what are you doing?"
Marge,Stop that! We're guests in Mr. Burns!
Marge,"Oh my sweet, undigested baby!"
Marge,And white blood cells are attacking my clothes!
Marge,"Although I must admit, they know where to stop."
Marge,Don't worry. We'll be fine!
Marge,"Cut me some slack, I'm a widow."
Marge,"Bart, where did you get those?"
Marge,Simpson.
Marge,"Relax, we're just looky-loos. We're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors."
Marge,"It's so beautiful and modern. Ooh, a Sub-Zero fridge..."
Marge,"This is the kitchen I've always wanted. Ooh, a bread maker-maker!"
Marge,"Homie, when I married you, I knew we wouldn't live in luxury."
Marge,But seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves.
Marge,"Oh, Homie... that's so thoughtful, but maybe we should hire a professional contractor."
Marge,Maybe you should turn off the power.
Marge,Don't demolish along the way!
Marge,Playdude magazines? Have you been hiding bosom rags from me?
Marge,These magazines are from before we were married. Maybe you should throw them away.
Marge,"The articles, eh? So you wouldn't mind if I cut out all the erotic nudes?"
Marge,I'm not wearing any clothes. So why don't I just splay myself on a pool table!
Marge,"Okay, here's your precious articles."
Marge,I think you used too much plaster.
Marge,I never stopped telling you.
Marge,I'm calling a contractor.
Marge,Thanks for taking the job. I'm sorry my husband is being so difficult.
Marge,"When Virginia Woolf wrote ""every woman needs a room of one's own,"" she must have been talking about the kitchen."
Marge,And how 'bout a huzzah for my husband who paid for our new kitchen?
Marge,"Great stuff, Ned."
Marge,I guess it would be a hoot to have my face on everything.
Marge,"Bart, can you come in here for a second?"
Marge,"In the Ovenfresh Bakeoff, clever presentation is as important as taste. So I'm entering my dessert dogs!"
Marge,"It's deep fried cookie dough with meringue buns, cherry ""ketchup"" and caramel ""mustard."""
Marge,I hope the Ovenfresh Bake-off likes them as much as you do.
Marge,"Well, open it, open it, open it!"
Marge,"Oh my God! Someone, somewhere says I'm better than someone else!"
Marge,My dessert!
Marge,Well...
Marge,It's gonna be weird cooking without your tipsy father grabbing me from behind. But I think I'm up to it.
Marge,"Why thank you, Billy."
Marge,"Well... Stuart, I'm making a dessert that looks like a hot dog, but it isn't."
Marge,She is not!
Marge,Fish scales?
Marge,Stop! You're tainting my entry!
Marge,You did it on purpose?
Marge,Why is everyone at this bakeoff such a meanie-bo-beanie?
Marge,Why can't everyone just play fair and... Did you just dunk your hair in my mixing bowl?
Marge,"You're right. If I can feed a family of five on twelve dollars a week, I can do anything."
Marge,I stretch your father's meatloaf with sawdust.
Marge,I guess I was the last one.
Marge,These other dishes look so pretty. And those cheaters blackened my sugar wieners. I'd like to give those Betty Crookeds a taste of their own medicine. Yes... medicine.
Marge,Baby ear medicine.
Marge,Even the Pope couldn't forgive this pizza... and he's letting a lot of things slide these days.
Marge,"Don't worry, there's plenty for all of you! Now who's laughing? Huh? Huh? Me! I'm laughing!"
Marge,That's an entry?! I thought it was garbage.
Marge,What a kind yet oddly ominous thing to say. Now I've got to get ready for the finals.
Marge,"Well, it's not my fault! Lisa, the people in this bake-off are stinkers, who pushed me and pushed me, like the pushy-wushies they are!"
Marge,"Look, I'll be a winner with feet of clay... like Mickey Mantle. Everyone loves the Mick."
Marge,"Hey, plenty of kids are gonna look up to me when I'm Auntie whatever it is. Right now people just know me as the wife of the guy who doesn't go to work. Can't you understand that I need this?"
Marge,She's already ahead of me.
Marge,"Well, I didn't come this far not to cheat."
Marge,I look up to you...
Marge,...because you let me down.
Marge,That's clever... and devastating. Stop the competition!
Marge,I don't deserve to win. I sabotaged all the other entries!
Marge,"Thanks, honey, for saving me from myself."
Marge,"B.F.D. I've had your scrambled eggs, Homer. The secret ingredient is whiskey."
Marge,That coulda been me.
Marge,"Homer, the capital of Kentucky is Frankfort."
Marge,"Yes, it's something, dear."
Marge,He sure is -- if he can keep up with these party animals!
Marge,"Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Grandma Bouvier and Grampa!"
Marge,Plus your school-yard chums: Martin and Ralph!
Marge,It's the best I could do on such short notice.
Marge,He's got the measles. But we've got him on speakerphone!
Marge,"I told him to use a land line. Okay gang, let's get this party started -- or should I say Barted?"
Marge,"For our first game, I need everyone to draw a picture of President Eisenhower."
Marge,"Gee, I did the best I could..."
Marge,"Here's Lisa! She'll save the party! Honey, sit down... have a big slice of cake!"
Marge,"Lisa, wait..."
Marge,It's not just the presents -- the kids don't appreciate me anymore. They'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom.
Marge,"No! No, I've got a lot more mothering left in me!"
Marge,"I'll be right here at three to pick you up, then I'll take you to the zoo! We can eat fries out of a safari hat!"
Marge,"Well, I guess it's just you and me, Bart!"
Marge,They grow up so fast.
Marge,"Oh sure, you love me now, but you'll turn."
Marge,Aren't you the boy who beats up my son?
Marge,Those tadpoles are your lunch?
Marge,"Here, take this. My daughter didn't want the lunch I made."
Marge,You don't have to impress me by making fun of others. I already like you.
Marge,It's nice to be appreciated.
Marge,"Hey, kids, I just heard they cancelled league night down at the bowling alley. You know what that means -- open lanes!"
Marge,"Whaddya say? It'll be BLAM! Bart, Lisa And Mom. Huh?"
Marge,Fine! I'll take my mothering elsewhere.
Marge,"Great roll, Nelson! Here, I cut up your hot dog for you."
Marge,You've never had one before?
Marge,"And uh, where's your Dad in all this?"
Marge,"Nelson, how'd you like to earn some extra money around our house? I have some odd jobs my kids won't do."
Marge,"Sometimes I think he's more interested in his ""Itchy and Mitchy"" cartoons than me."
Marge,That's how we got our Kaypro!
Marge,"Now, I know there's a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt."
Marge,"Well, maybe not. But you did a great job on the lawn."
Marge,"Lisa, just take a bite. One bite -- that's all I ask!"
Marge,I didn't give your son charity. I gave him self-respect.
Marge,"Go home to your son, Mrs. Muntz. And try not to have intercourse on the way!"
Marge,"Nelson, what are you doing out this late?"
Marge,She's still your mother. Come inside.
Marge,Can I get you a glass of milk?
Marge,Uh-huh.
Marge,"Bart, have you ever eaten a Tootsie Pop? You know, there's a tough crunchy shell, but if you lick it, there's a delicious sweetness inside. Be nice to Nelson and I'll give you a Tootsie Pop."
Marge,"Bart, eat up or you'll be late for school!"
Marge,"Nelson, doesn't that hurt your teeth?"
Marge,I don't like the sound of that. Tomorrow I'm taking you to Doctor Shapiro.
Marge,No! I want to hear what happened at the store!
Marge,"Well, I'm glad everything worked out so well."
Marge,Sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer.
Marge,Perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese.
Marge,"Homer, that was for the dog."
Marge,What's that rumble?
Marge,This is the most exciting scandal since the Juice was on the loose.
Marge,She's from Springfield! I knew her in high school.
Marge,Chloe sure turned out successful.
Marge,"Chloe, hi!"
Marge,Evergreen Terrace.
Marge,"Terrace. Evergreen Terrace. The street that smells like pee. This is my daughter, Lisa."
Marge,"Well, it is good to see you, Chloe. Would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow?"
Marge,Homer.
Marge,Well... Oh. We finally found out why the dog was scooting around on his butt all day. Turns out he had an impacted anal gland.
Marge,"The excitement never stops. Chloe, would you like to see slides of our trip to Athens... Boulevard Recreational Center?"
Marge,I guess.
Marge,"You know, Chloe, some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place."
Marge,"Homer, why do you always have to show that to company?"
Marge,"Homer, what are you doing?"
Marge,"Gee, with all that travel, you probably haven't had much time to find that special someone."
Marge,Did you just swallow another bone?
Marge,That's ridiculous. No one's bowl smells... it's like Christmas in Aspen.
Marge,"Back then, we were both stars - in the thrill-a-minute world of high school journalism."
Marge,Together we broke the biggest story of the semester -- one of the cafeteria workers was spitting in the soup.
Marge,"When we published the story, we received the school's highest award."
Marge,"Well, we both faced a tough decision...go off to journalism school, or stay in Springfield with our sweethearts?"
Marge,"Chloe left town as soon as Barney proposed. I would've followed her, but my plans changed when God brought me a wonderful little boy... Bart, stop that!"
Marge,Why would Homer write his name in grime?
Marge,That's better.
Marge,"Well, I just made the bathroom floor smell like lemons. Where's the award for that?"
Marge,Chloe has such an amazing life. I wonder what would have happened if I'd stuck with journalism.
Marge,"Yeah, I guess."
Marge,"That's a sweet thought, Homie."
Marge,How dare you show my daughter a life of fun and possibility?
Marge,"For your information, our electric dishwasher is on the fritz."
Marge,"Not that you care about the ups and downs of my appliances. Do ya? Huh, do ya?"
Marge,I'm so sick of names!
Marge,No one's fighting over you!
Marge,SHINER BE GONE.
Marge,"Lisa, let me explain what happened tonight. Sometimes when your Mom has half a glass of wine, she goes cuckoo bananas."
Marge,Let me think about it. No.
Marge,"Lisa -- breakfast! I know you're mad at me, but I hope you're not mad at Cap'n Crunch..."
Marge,"Homer, we've gotta get Lisa!"
Marge,I don't see Lisa in any of the seminars!
Marge,"Homer, look!"
Marge,She's taken my daughter to an erupting volcano? That's it! She is off the Christmas card list.
Marge,We've gotta go now!
Marge,"I'm coming, sweetheart!"
Marge,"I'll save you, Lisa! Whoa."
Marge,Shut up!
Marge,Nothing's more powerful than a mother's love.
Marge,Don't worry. We've got two hours before it burns down to my head.
Marge,"Well, looking at you kids, I know I made the right choice in life."
Marge,"This is Marge Simpson, reporting from Lake Placid where the miracle on ice never happened."
Marge,Nooooo!
Marge,Lousy drawer... potato masher stuck in small spoon slot... what kind of madman would do that?
Marge,"Oh, Bart, honey I'm so sorry."
Marge,No harm done.
Marge,"Maybe when the Tooth Fairy saw it was your last baby tooth, she realized you're not a little boy anymore. So she gave you a grown-up gift."
Marge,"Bart, someone wrote something cynical on your shirt!"
Marge,Let me wash it off.
Marge,"Well, I like T-shirts with a nice joke, like ""support our troops."""
Marge,"We're big fans, Mr. Gladwell."
Marge,What a delightful sprite.
Marge,"Homer, use your inside voice."
Marge,"Homer, I want you to get that gamma radiating what's-it out of my home!"
Marge,I can't believe Mr. Burns reserved the entire museum just for an office party.
Marge,"Homer, these are people you work with. Show some restraint."
Marge,I've got a bad feeling about all of this.
Marge,"Homer, that was Apollo Twelve!"
Marge,"Now that Mr. Burns has eliminated the drug plan, we're gonna have to cut back on our diseases."
Marge,I just don't see why one little pill should cost thirty dollars!
Marge,"Well, the drug company won't do anything to help us."
Marge,"Now, before we eat, let's remember what we're celebrating today -- after many years of hard work, your father finally paid off the mortgage."
Marge,"Stow it, you two!"
Marge,Stop making a scene!
Marge,What's going on here?
Marge,"Homer, those kookoo-birds at the bank goofed up and sent us a mortgage statement."
Marge,M631700000642J?! This is a new loan tracking number -- you got a new mortgage?
Marge,You gave the money to Moe? How's he gonna pay us back?
Marge,"Well, maybe I'll go to Moe's too, seeing as I'm now part owner."
Marge,I would like it. You never come to my mother's.
Marge,"Until you pay us back, you're answering to me! And there's gonna be big changes."
Marge,I'm here protecting our investment. I'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids.
Marge,Quit playing dumb.
Marge,"Come on, go home."
Marge,"Maybe some cheerier paint would make this place less of a ""dive."""
Marge,"Well... as fabulous as your regulars are, a remodel might bring in a higher class of lush."
Marge,"I had a feeling you'd say that. So I prepared something that might help you ""change your tune."""
Marge,THIS PLACE IS A DIAMOND / BUT IT'S TRAPPED IN THE ROUGH
Marge,HERE'S MY NEW IDEA TO SELL BOTH BEER AND GRUB / WE WILL TURN THIS FILTHY DIVE INTO A PROPER OLD-TIME BRITISH PUB!
Marge,"Well, I was thinking more like drapes and a paint job, but your idea's good too."
Marge,"Thanks, Moe."
Marge,"Boy, what a night! Moe showed me how to give someone the bum's rush. Here, watch."
Marge,"Get lost, rummy!"
Marge,"I know, I used to think of Moe as a scabby, dead-eyed hunchback. But now that I've gotten to know him, we kind of bonded."
Marge,"Homer, Moe and I are just work friends. You and I are... marriage friends."
Marge,"Moe? What's up, partner?"
Marge,"Ooh, that's a great idea."
Marge,Of course not! I'm in bed with Homer!
Marge,Mm-hmm.
Marge,"Howdy, partner! Why don't you sit next to us?"
Marge,"Homer, can you hold my wedding ring for a second? My finger's itchy."
Marge,"Oh, I'm too tired to talk."
Marge,"Homie, I'm tired. I have to get up early to catch my flight."
Marge,Moe and I are going to the Tavern and Restaurant Owners Convention in Aruba this weekend. Don't you ever listen to me? I told you ten times.
Marge,"Me too, Moe. What a nice surprise that we've become friends."
Marge,"Moe, your upper lip is trembling."
Marge,"Moe, did you see something troubling on the tarmac?"
Marge,I don't know what to say.
Marge,That sounds like Homer.
Marge,Homer! How'd you get in here?
Marge,He's right.
Marge,Moe! No I don't love you. And I'm certainly not going to leave my husband.
Marge,I'm afraid so.
Marge,Homie...
Marge,"Homer, I made a vow on our wedding day, to stay by you -- for better or worse. And besides... I love you. You're my Homie-womie-romie-domie..."
Marge,"Moe, I need to tell you something."
Marge,You showed me you could be a really sweet guy. You can make a woman very happy some day.
Marge,It's true. You'd be quite a catch... if you'd just shower and shave and stop swearing under your breath.
Marge,Really? Is it one that will change the sleeping arrangements?
Marge,"Goodnight, both of you."
Marge,Who's watching the kids?
Marge,LOVE LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER
Marge,YOU'D BETTER STOP
Marge,I SAID STOP
Marge,I agree. Hey! Aren't you that crazy Cat Lady?
Marge,Those are just Reese's Pieces.
Marge,I know how to save this park -- I'm gonna organize a charity carnival!
Marge,"God, that Junior League burns me up."
Marge,"Everyone seemed so happy, but I'm surprised at Ned. He left out all the good times Cain and Abel had when they were growing up."
Marge,Bart! How do you know these things?
Marge,"Lisa, could you pass the salad?"
Marge,Who wants to help me clear the table?
Marge,Oh my. Ned's next movie seems even bloodier than the last one.
Marge,I can't take any more!
Marge,"Ned, there's more to the Bible than blood and gore."
Marge,"Well, I don't like this movie. And I'm going to boycott your financier... Mr. Burns."
Marge,Solar.
Marge,"Oh Homie, don't worry. I'm sure you'll come up with a great idea."
Marge,Billions!
Marge,Just poke through.
Marge,"Time for Homer's half-time show. Get ready, Frank."
Marge,"Homie, I think you did great. And to celebrate, I made omelets from the eggs people threw at our house."
Marge,Dissin'? Do rappers still say that?
Marge,Baggy britches? Loose-laced gym shoes? Are you going to a rap performance?
Marge,"All too well. Rap music belongs in the rubbish bin. It encourages punching, boastfulness, and rudeness to ""ho's."""
Marge,"Well, you are not going to any concert that promulgates stink talk."
Marge,"Oh did he? Homer, you tell your son a rap show is not a safe place for a ten-year-old!"
Marge,"DON'T ARGUE WITH MARGE, I KNOW WHAT'S BEST / THE ONLY RAP IN THIS CRIB, KEEPS SANDWICHES FRESH!"
Marge,FRESH FR-FR-FRESH FOR MOMMY'S BABY BOY
Marge,That little sneak disobeyed us and went to that hip-hop festival!
Marge,We have kidnapped your son. Follow instructions and Bart will not be harmed.
Marge,Thanksgiving's not for months.
Marge,"Ooh, what a horrible thing to say to a mother."
Marge,"It's ""Win a Hawaiian Getaway Week"" on Channel Six."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Please give me back my boy! I just want to tell him I love him one more time.
Marge,"Oh Bart, I'm so glad you're okay."
Marge,"Excuse me, Reverend."
Marge,"As long as two people love each other, I don't think God cares whether they both have the same hoo-hoo or ha-ha."
Marge,Which book?
Marge,But Reverend... Scriptural scholars disagree on the significance for Christians of many of the Old Testament's proscriptions.
Marge,Jesus' teachings stressed inclusiveness and compassion...
Marge,"Homer, you married every gay couple in town."
Marge,Don't you push them! They've gotta work that out for themselves.
Marge,Straight.
Marge,But Veronica's a girl's name. Did you know that?
Marge,"Oh Homie, I'm so proud of you. You stood up for people's right to express love in its most perfect form, a binding legal contract."
Marge,"You're getting married?! Patty, that's wonderful!"
Marge,"So tell, tell. Who's the lucky man? What does he do? Let me guess: does he work in Customer Support?"
Marge,Oh no. No no. No. I'm just... surprised.
Marge,So Patty. You're a woman who likes women. I guess that fear I always had of you stealing Homer away is unfounded.
Marge,"Well, I guess I could have seen the signs."
Marge,"Oh no. Oh no. Why would it be? I love you and I love gay marriage, so I'd be a super-hypocrite if I didn't love your gay marriage. Right?"
Marge,Because she's bringing over someone very special. Her fiancée.
Marge,Actually your aunt is marrying a very lucky... woman.
Marge,"So Veronica, what do you do?"
Marge,No surprises there.
Marge,Whoa! Save something for your wedding night.
Marge,I don't think it's exactly what Mom would want.
Marge,Of course. Everyone should do whatever they want. Take a bear to church! Read a book with your feet! Change your name to Gooble-Glop!
Marge,"I just can't believe my sister would keep me in the dark all these years, then expect complete acceptance on the day she gets married."
Marge,The toilet seat's up!
Marge,But that wouldn't happen unless...
Marge,She's a man! Looks like Patty's gonna get something she didn't register for.
Marge,No! I can't let this happen!
Marge,"Patty, it's not what you think. Veronica is a man!"
Marge,"Well, I've learned a lesson. Just because you're a lesbian, it doesn't make you less of a bein'."
Marge,"Grampa, you're a greet grater! I mean a great greeter! Now look who's senile!"
Marge,I'll take a cart.
Marge,"Lisa, you took out a restraining order against your own brother?"
Marge,I always hoped we wouldn't be one of those restraining order families.
Marge,"Please lift this restraining order, Judge Harm. It's poking our family apart."
Marge,"Bart, Lisa went over to Janey's. Quick, run inside and go potty!"
Marge,"Lisa, don't you think your brother's suffered enough?"
Marge,He's done good things for you too.
Marge,He brought home your homework when you were sick.
Marge,"Well, let's count that anyway."
Marge,It's a natural process that women of a certain age go through.
Marge,"Selma, I never realized you wanted a child so badly."
Marge,"Don't cry, sweetie. Everything's gonna be all right."
Marge,Wait till the Drambuie and sleeping pills kick in.
Marge,"Go, go, go!"
Marge,"Homer, if you do this one small favor, it could transform Selma's life."
Marge,"Okay, don't do it for her--"
Marge,Do it for me.
Marge,"Thank you, Mr. Simpson."
Marge,"Homer, no stop! You're thinking of Buckingham Palace!"
Marge,"Mind your manners, Lisa."
Marge,"Selma, she's beautiful!"
Marge,"Homer, of all the sneaky, dishonest things you've ever done, playing Selma's husband was by far the sweetest."
Marge,"Okay, one quick snuggle."
Marge,"Hold still, Homie."
Marge,Just think about the day you found that Junior Mint in your bellybutton.
Marge,"Plus, we get free apple, orange and grapefruit juice!"
Marge,Is there anything more fun than a nice Sunday drive?
Marge,"Hey, hey, it's Krusty the clown! What do you say, Krusty?"
Marge,Always nice to see him.
Marge,He's cleaning out the garage. I can picture it now...
Marge,Homie!
Marge,"Oh, thank God! He's alive!"
Marge,Honey... your near-fatal boo boo today really scared me. What would the kids and I do if something happened to you?
Marge,You keep almost dying. Just look at our vacation photos.
Marge,"Homie, if you die, I'm gonna have three kids to take care of. I want you to buy some life insurance. Please?"
Marge,"I know, I just wan--"
Marge,You don't smoke!
Marge,I'm not gonna worry just because Homer doesn't have insurance. A lot of people don't!
Marge,"Oh, this is only based on a story. A true story!"
Marge,We need to start saving!
Marge,Go easy on that -- it's gotta last 'til you're five.
Marge,That's right. It's much less expensive than the leading clown-based cereal. You just have to assemble it yourself.
Marge,We saved fifty cents on that purchase!
Marge,"Oh, we're just saving for... a very rainy day."
Marge,"Well, I just think we should be building a nest egg."
Marge,I have a book from the library with the same information!
Marge,No more directory assistance! It's not free!
Marge,No more oriental mustard!
Marge,"Can you help me unload this soup from the car? There was a sale, so I bought four hundred cans."
Marge,"Oh Honey, I know it's not easy, but we've got to put money away."
Marge,"Don't you think you've had enough ""fun?"""
Marge,"Last year, you spent five thousand dollars on donuts, two thousand on scalp massages, five hundred on body glitter--"
Marge,"Oh please. From what I hear, you waltz in there at 10:30, take a nap on the toilet, then sit around ""Google""-ing your own name until lunch."
Marge,"You shouted it while we were making love! Now look here, Mister. I pay the bills, I do the budget, and I'm in charge of the money."
Marge,My scrimpings!
Marge,Did you spend our savings on a motor home?
Marge,"Well I hope you enjoy it, your majesty -- 'cause I'm not speaking to you!"
Marge,"Kids, come back in the house!"
Marge,I melted string cheese over some corn chips!
Marge,I'll let you sass me!
Marge,You can wear swimsuits instead of underwear!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,What are all these recreational vehicles doing here?
Marge,This is a house!
Marge,I know another place you can go -- to sleep!
Marge,"Can't turn off the power, eh?"
Marge,"Lights out, weirdoes!"
Marge,You don't belong on the lawn. You belong in your bed with your wife!
Marge,"Well, you're not perfect either!"
Marge,You hide food in my hair... you think brushing your teeth is foreplay...
Marge,I'll have you know I could have married Sideshow Mel!
Marge,And I'm so sick of that story about finding an onion ring in your French fries. It was twenty years ago!
Marge,"Captain, wait! I have something here that might change your mind!"
Marge,You don't take anything seriously. Not even your bankruptcy hearing!
Marge,"""Dear Mom and Dad: We don't want you guys to split up, so we're driving the RV back to the dealer."" We've got to stop them."
Marge,"Oh my God, there they are!"
Marge,"Oh, I've lost them! I can't see past all the SUVs!"
Marge,"We'll stop fighting, we promise!"
Marge,"We're not quite there yet, but we've opened up a dialogue!"
Marge,"Oh, come here!"
Marge,Now pull over!
Marge,My kids are on your boat -- turn back!
Marge,"Three hundred cans of Budget Club mushroom soup! If you have some noodles and tuna fish, you could make a casserole that's small on price, but big on flavor."
Marge,"Well, if he thinks he's getting a corner piece, forget it."
Marge,"Hey, it's only money. And it did make a cool splash."
Marge,"Which came first, turkey the bird or Turkey the you guys?"
Marge,"If you don't want to say it, just think it."
Marge,"You know, we should visit Shelbyville more often. They have a store that just sells shoes. I feel like I'm in Paris!"
Marge,"Let's see. There's ""Equus"" starring Sideshow Mel... ""The Three Dollar Bills in 'Gay, Gay, Gay!'""... ooh, ""Song Of Shelbyville""!"
Marge,This is the worst crisis the Springfield Cultural Activities Board has ever faced.
Marge,Those Shelbyvillians are maligning us all. I've never heard such mean-spirited hate-hoots.
Marge,Why do you come to these meetings?
Marge,"There must be something else. Think Marge, think. Culture... vulture... birds of prey... pray in a church... the father, son and Holy Ghost... ghosts are scary, scary rhymes with Gehry! That's it -- Architect Frank Gehry! He could build us a concert hall like he did in Los Angeles."
Marge,Then it's agreed! We ask Frank Gehry to build us a concert hall!
Marge,"Dear Mr. Gehry: Would you please build a concert hall for our town? We may not be the biggest city, or the prettiest, but we were the first city in America to abandon the metric system!"
Marge,I wrote that letter.
Marge,"Well, aren't you?"
Marge,I'm so excited. It's like giving birth to a child of steel and iron.
Marge,Don't leave now! The next piece is an atonal medley by Philip Glass!
Marge,He's turned it into a prison!
Marge,"Ooh, a Tiffany's box! And the thing inside is from Tiffany's! Homie, you've never done this before. How'd you afford it?"
Marge,Haven't you seen what happens to people who rat in prison movies?
Marge,The prison snitch is killed! And that could be you! Because you're the prison snitch!
Marge,"Homer! Homer, where are you?"
Marge,As President of the cultural board I was given a key to the concert hall.
Marge,"Oh, you must be Michael's dad!"
Marge,I want you to look into the faces of those poor men -- each one is a life you made worse with your ratting.
Marge,"Oh, Homie..."
Marge,"Governor, I think the only fair solution is to pardon all these thugs and murderers."
Marge,"Kids, come down for your prom photo!"
Marge,Oooh. Smile!
Marge,"Oh it's so great. We can do anything now that scientists have invented magic. I'm so proud of you. Lisa, graduating two years early, and Bart... graduating."
Marge,"Homer, we're separated now. You can't just walk in without knocking."
Marge,"Homer, just settle down. We just got a postcard from Maggie."
Marge,She's really enjoying Alaska.
Marge,"Lisa, your date's here!"
Marge,When I was a kid we didn't show our affection by head-butting.
Marge,"Oh, I am so glad you think so."
Marge,"Kids... I want you to know I've started seeing someone. He's from Springfield, I think you know him..."
Marge,The one what?
Marge,You mean get beaten up by him?
Marge,"And I'll admit, it is kinda romantic under the sea."
Marge,"Homer, do something about this leak!"
Marge,"You know Homer, I let a lot of things slide, but when you can't keep a roof over your family's head, you're just not much of a father."
Marge,"That teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you!"
Marge,It's raining inside!
Marge,Homer! I woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me.
Marge,It means you have to fix the roof!
Marge,Knockers on route 98.
Marge,"I'm psychic. Look, I don't know if I want a roofer who hangs out in bars."
Marge,"Well, he better high-five our roof!"
Marge,"Come on, kids! We're gonna visit Grampa. Then we're gonna take the dog to the V-E-T..."
Marge,...then take Bart to get C-I-R-C-U-M-C-I-S-E-D.
Marge,I'll tell you what it means when it's over.
Marge,"Okay kids, we only have time for a quick visit to Grampa, so as soon as he feels loved, we're outta there."
Marge,"Oh, he must smell leftovers."
Marge,"Well, he does seem happy here..."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,You're drooling on my Goodwill pile!
Marge,And why is the hole in the roof even bigger?
Marge,It's after six -- he's not coming back. He's a lousy roofer and a flake!
Marge,I don't want to hear any more about Ray. Tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself.
Marge,You're not married to Ray!
Marge,"Yeah, I bet the old people will be acting like young people, like in those cell phone ads everyone hates."
Marge,He's become one of them!
Marge,"Hey boy, want a treat?"
Marge,"We better get you home. Come on, Lisa."
Marge,Geez Louise...
Marge,"How you feeling, sweetie?"
Marge,What are you doing? Why aren't you fixing the roof?
Marge,"I'm so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable Ray! Who, by the way, I've never even met!"
Marge,"Homer, how did you think I'd feel when I saw that?"
Marge,"Homer, come down for dinner."
Marge,Ray's not coming!
Marge,"Homer, I know where Ray is."
Marge,"Sweetheart, your friend Ray is in your head."
Marge,You have to understand -- Ray doesn't exist.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Homer, no one has ever seen Ray but you."
Marge,I called that bosom bar. The bartender said you were there alone.
Marge,Electro-shock?
Marge,I see Ray too.
Marge,When did I agree to that?
Marge,You didn't validate my parking.
Marge,"Wait, there's still one last thing that doesn't make sense. Why did you start fixing our roof and then just disappear?"
Marge,That's right -- you're all crooks!
Marge,"Bart, I spent all afternoon stuffing tuna fish into that steak. Have some."
Marge,"Oh, so I've been replaced by a machine?"
Marge,"Well until that day, I'm still Bart's mother, and I don't like him stuffing himself with junk."
Marge,"Oh, fine."
Marge,His liver looks healthy.
Marge,"Doctor, you're a pediatrician!"
Marge,I talked to Dr. Hibbert today. He gave me a list of heart-smart foods.
Marge,Cottage cheese!
Marge,"Aw honey, please take this seriously. When people used to ask me how you were doing, I said ""at least he's got his health."" Now you've got nothing! Nothing! For me, please try a healthy vegetable."
Marge,"Okay, now we know you're allergic to cauliflower. But I made a special platter of vegetables that are good for you."
Marge,It's graffiti you can eatie!
Marge,"They're not kidnappers! They're professionally trained child-snatchers, who are taking you to a maximum-security fat camp."
Marge,Forty-seven?
Marge,"Don't you mean ""tough love?"""
Marge,Jimminy Kimmel! Look how much they're charging for Bart's treatment!
Marge,"I already use crayons for lipstick, and fireplace soot for eyeliner."
Marge,"This fat camp can save Bart's life -- we have to find a way to pay for it. Homer, maybe you could ask Mr. Burns for a raise."
Marge,"Bart, what are you doing here?"
Marge,But... you're still fat!
Marge,To give these Germans das boot? Jawohl!
Marge,No you didn't.
Marge,I was hoping we'd miss the three o'clock hold-up. I don't know what to do for dinner now.
Marge,"Vegetables, you've been promoted from side dish to entrée."
Marge,"Bart, don't use that word... Oh crap."
Marge,"Don't worry about the competition, sweetie. Whenever I enter a contest I tell myself I'm going to win because, sometimes, if you believe hard enough, God cuts you a break. After all, he works for us. Our prayers pay his salary."
Marge,"Lisa, that sounds like a fancier version of the song you're going to sing!"
Marge,But your song said you liked Springfield.
Marge,"Sweetie, tonight you were perfect..."
Marge,"Homie, I'm worried you're turning into some kind of super koo-koo stage mother."
Marge,"Bart, you wanna go to the video arcade?"
Marge,"Actually, I think your father's still upset about the way things went down."
Marge,"Hey, kids! I scream, you scream, we all scream for..."
Marge,Haircuts!
Marge,You have?! That's so nice!
Marge,A kids' barbershop? But they don't have my templates.
Marge,"Oh. I see. Well, good luck getting to your precious mall barber, 'cause I'm not driving you."
Marge,I guess I'll just cut my own hair.
Marge,"Sweetie, don't worry. God wouldn't spring the Rapture on us unannounced. He'd send us signs, like, I don't know, all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving."
Marge,"Ooh, I could be the Rachel to your Jacob."
Marge,"Here's a pretty little wig for Lisa, and a handsome toupee for Bart!"
Marge,"So, you still think I'm crazy for saving all your hair trimmings?"
Marge,Okay then. Let's get the rest of this hair back in the freezer.
Marge,"Homer, you didn't touch your second dinner tonight. And you're reading books! Word books! What's going on?"
Marge,"Three million, one hundred and--"
Marge,May eighteenth? That's one week from today!
Marge,"Homer, I'm glad you're getting exercise, I just wish it wasn't crazy exercise."
Marge,The stars are falling to the earth!
Marge,Just as you predicted.
Marge,Lisa's going! We're all going!
Marge,"I'm so proud of you, Homie!"
Marge,Homie... I'd better start dinner.
Marge,"We're not going anywhere, except to bed!"
Marge,You couldn't predict six o'clock at five thirty! Now good night!
Marge,The worst part is I'll never see my Homie again!
Marge,The Warren Harding Through-hole never seemed so long.
Marge,But we don't have a sitter for Maggie.
Marge,A TV shark is not a babysitter!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Honey, you can be anything you want to be."
Marge,What language is this? Gibby-Gabby?
Marge,"Bart, don't make fun of grad students -- they just made a terrible life choice."
Marge,"Ned, let me give you a little something for babysitting."
Marge,"You've got a big house, Ned. If you need extra money, why don't you rent out a room?"
Marge,What are you two doing?
Marge,Bart! Turn away from that screen and look out the window!
Marge,It's happening in Ned's house! Why would he allow that?
Marge,"C'mon. You tell him right now. Ned, Homer has something to tell you."
Marge,You know what I mean.
Marge,"Well, Homer, you've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want. But at least we have a chance to start fresh -- so let's be on our best behavior, okay?"
Marge,That's coming from next door!
Marge,"Bart, get your things. You're leaving with me!"
Marge,"Bart, I love you. But sometimes I don't love your choices. Now we have to find another school for you."
Marge,"Bart, this could be a good new school... Oakwood Academy! Huh?"
Marge,Think of the leg up you'd have!
Marge,What if there's a fire?
Marge,How 'bout this one -- St. Jerome's Catholic School?
Marge,"Bart, I'm glad you had fun, but I wouldn't get too into that Catholic church. With all the sitting and standing and kneeling, it's like Simon Says without a winner!"
Marge,"Don't you touch bead one! Homer, maybe we should be concerned. Catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control, no meat on Friday..."
Marge,"Let's just change the subject. Bart, would you like to say grace?"
Marge,"Homer, you've been out all night! And you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something. Were you at that Catholic Church?!"
Marge,I knew they'd try to convert you! That's what they do! Well I'm not having another twelve kids.
Marge,"Forget it! And you know, I went to a Catholic wedding once. The incense ruined my pantsuit!"
Marge,"Well, Homer and Bart are well, they're under the weather."
Marge,"All right! I admit it -- they're both at the Catholic Church! Reverend, what should I do?"
Marge,I guess it's good that they're taking an interest in spirituality.
Marge,where's Homer and Bart?
Marge,I wish my family was with me.
Marge,"Well then, I'd like to speak with Jesus."
Marge,Noooo!!!
Marge,First Communion?!
Marge,"Homer, you're physically an adult, and what you do in the privacy of your own soul is your business. But I didn't change Bart's diapers for five years to see him become a Catholic."
Marge,Let's go!
Marge,They weren't following us.
Marge,I just don't think your father's the right person to pick out a religion for you.
Marge,"Hello, Homer."
Marge,"It wasn't a fair fight! Your church suckered him in with gory stories, just like we were suckered into getting Cinemax."
Marge,"Well, I'm gonna show Bart that Protestants can be hip too. How do you like those croutons?"
Marge,"Now Bart, isn't this the kind of religion you'd like to be a part of for all eternity?"
Marge,"What's wrong, Bart? You love youth culture!"
Marge,"Oh Bart, I knew one of these dumb things would work!"
Marge,My hive! My trademark hive!
Marge,Why would we want to go to Santa's Village? It's August.
Marge,"Homer, before I take the kids, I want you to swear you're not up to something."
Marge,And I'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.
Marge,Fros-ty! Where's your magic top hat?
Marge,My Christmas present to myself this year was leaving that place early.
Marge,"Look, I know this wasn't the greatest outing, but your father meant well, so don't let him know that we didn't ."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Is this a snuggle film?!
Marge,"How could you allow this, in the room where we... do puzzles?!"
Marge,All right.
Marge,Away from you.
Marge,I don't know.
Marge,You are.
Marge,"Bye Bart! I love you, Lisa! Sleep tight, Maggie! Today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge!"
Marge,Can he swim?
Marge,I guess I'd better tell them I'm coming home.
Marge,"I'm at a rest stop south of Springfield. I know, you're sorry now. Then you'll buy me some Kwik-E-Mart flowers, maybe a box of candy where half the pieces mysteriously have ""testing bites,"" and a week later you'll be back to your old thoughtless self."
Marge,I love you too...
Marge,"Hold on, I'll be off in a minute."
Marge,"Listen, buster. I had to buy a club soda I didn't want to get change for this phone!"
Marge,An oogli-boogli!
Marge,I'll call you back!
Marge,"Well what if by harming a manatee you could save two manatees? But before you answer, consider this: the manatee you'd have to harm is pregnant."
Marge,I think the worst part was when I realized that Homer lied to me.
Marge,Exactly!
Marge,Maybe you could just put a hat on him and say it's a trick.
Marge,Huh.
Marge,And treated like I deserve.
Marge,"Okay, water monsters. Be friendly. But not too friendly."
Marge,What do I do?
Marge,"Okay. Uh... you know, up close you're kinda cute."
Marge,"Aw, you're a good thing. I know it. Let me clean out your ears."
Marge,I've bonded with him!
Marge,Where is he taking me?
Marge,I've got my groove back!
Marge,I can't believe how many manatees we saved today.
Marge,Homer?
Marge,Ooo.
Marge,"Homie, I accept your apology."
Marge,But I'm not coming back yet.
Marge,I've found a place where I'm needed.
Marge,"I'm sorry, Homie. I just can't find it in my heart to come back right now."
Marge,"Oh, my sweet, sweet Homie! You sacrificed yourself for the manatees."
Marge,"I'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species... a devoted husband."
Marge,And I always will.
Marge,Don't you have to be back at work?
Marge,Homer! Do something about the noise!
Marge,"Well, they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us. What ever happened to ""please"" and ""thank you""?"
Marge,We have to stop all this construction. The noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the Jell-o.
Marge,Instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard?!
Marge,"This is a little too spooky for me. I don't even like watching ""The Count"" on Sesame Street."
Marge,Go back to your own country!
Marge,"Oh sure you can, sweetie. Just don't make a habit of it."
Marge,So that's why I've been smelling margaritas at three a.m.
Marge,"Lisa, honey. I know last night was tough, but all our kids sleep by themselves. We don't even hear Maggie cry at night anymore!"
Marge,"Oh, wait a minute. There's no batteries in this thing."
Marge,"Tonight I want you to really try to sleep in your own bed, because... Homer, stop that!"
Marge,NOOOO!
Marge,"Homer, can you help me out here?"
Marge,Isn't this Lenny's house?
Marge,"Lisa, do you really want to watch this?"
Marge,What a lousy party.
Marge,"I don't care what Apu was in a past life. In this life, he's a blabbermouth!"
Marge,Look who's sleeping in our bed again.
Marge,"I spy with my little eye, a girl who's not sleeping in her room like she promised."
Marge,"Homer, we're not really playing."
Marge,What if we show Lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened? Hm?
Marge,"Well, I hope he's accompanied by the ""How was your day"" monster, and the ""Foot rub"" monster and the let me just..."
Marge,"Lisa, honey. Any chance you can stop reading soon?"
Marge,We need professional help.
Marge,"Frankly, no. Lisa kind of took care of herself. Our oldest, Bart, was such a handful."
Marge,"Homer, stop that!"
Marge,Four thousand dollars?!
Marge,"Don't worry, we're not evil spirits."
Marge,The cemetery? And you're just sitting here?
Marge,You're watching cartoons!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Sweetie, we're gonna get you home and straighten out all these fears you have."
Marge,Maggie!
Marge,That's not what you do with a hymnal. Homer!
Marge,Something's wrong with Maggie. We should get her to Dr. Hibbert. But I don't see him anywhere.
Marge,Dr. Hibbert?
Marge,"I hate to interrupt while you're rejoicing, but Maggie is terribly itchy."
Marge,Amen!
Marge,"Sweetie, I know it itches, but you've gotta stop scratching!"
Marge,No!
Marge,"No!!! Here, here play with your teddy bear."
Marge,"Oh, sugar-booger!"
Marge,"Homer, don't touch her! You've never had chicken pox."
Marge,"Oh, I'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult! It could leave you sterile down there."
Marge,Welcome to our pox party. Save room for punch -- Maggie's bathing in the bowl!
Marge,"Oh Kirk, come join the parents in the kitchen. We're having alcohol drinks, and dishing on the parents who aren't here."
Marge,"Chief, don't you think you've had enough?"
Marge,"Look, why don't you both stay and have one of my Marge-aritas?"
Marge,"All right, we get it!"
Marge,"Oh Homie, you got chicken pox. But how?"
Marge,"You sit in this oatmeal awhile, and it'll send your itchies packing! Homer!"
Marge,Stop eating the oatmeal! That's the third tub you've eaten!
Marge,"Oh boy, am I beat! If you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day!"
Marge,How could you ask me that?
Marge,"Homer, you're crazy!"
Marge,Fine... No!
Marge,"No, no, no!"
Marge,You don't trust me? After I salved every chicken pock on your ungrateful body! How dare you!
Marge,Get out of this house!
Marge,"Why did I marry that selfish jerk? I've asked him to flip the mattress a thousand times, and he never does!"
Marge,"Hi, sweetie."
Marge,Uh-hmm.
Marge,"Really? Well, just for that I'm gonna erase all the saved games on your PlayStation."
Marge,I learned about it in here.
Marge,No.
Marge,"Innocent?! After all I do for your father, he still doesn't trust me. I'm finished with him."
Marge,"Young man, you go work on your spelling... or I'll delete all the custom ring tones from your cell phone!"
Marge,"So, I got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize."
Marge,Where's my apology?
Marge,Homer! I can save you both! Just let go of the rock!
Marge,Just do it! Trust me!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Well, I guess you showed you do trust me after all."
Marge,"Oh, Homie..."
Marge,"Bart, wake up. I got that bike you wanted!"
Marge,A robot?
Marge,I thought he was in a coma!
Marge,You already said that!
Marge,Okay.
Marge,"Oh, he knows how to push all my buttons."
Marge,David is so helpful...
Marge,David and Bart just aren't working out. We have to do something.
Marge,You told me he was at culinary school!
Marge,"Well, the important thing is we're a family again."
Marge,I'll call work and tell them he can't make it.
Marge,"""Dear Homer Simpson -- Mr. Burns invites you to a hunting party at his private estate."" Parenthesis, sinister laugh, closed parenthesis."
Marge,He still thinks that hobo was a bird.
Marge,I should've known something was wrong when we got this week's TV Guide.
Marge,Done and done!
Marge,Staying out eighteen hours and not calling home once.
Marge,And I am glad you're okay.
Marge,I was asking for something.
Marge,My spine is not a scratching post!
Marge,"Lisa, do you think you could check on your father?"
Marge,"Don't listen to them, Maggie. Maggie?"
Marge,"I'm so glad we came to Paradise Pier. Ever since I was a little girl, I've wanted to ride that Ferris Wheel!"
Marge,"Homie, no! It's not street legal!"
Marge,"For the last time, no!"
Marge,"Uh, he's just faking loss of vitality, Reverend."
Marge,A bicycle built for two! And I could be one of those two!
Marge,"Homie, if I buy a bicycle built for two, will you ride with me?"
Marge,I'll take it! I can't believe I own a tandem bike!
Marge,"Our tandem bicycle! When I bought it, you said you'd ride with me."
Marge,I was really looking forward to it.
Marge,"Bart, how'd you like to go on a tandem bike ride with your mom?"
Marge,"Maggie, would you like to ride with me?"
Marge,I'd love to! I'll be right... wait... Are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast?
Marge,Awww. I'll be right down.
Marge,Puddle!
Marge,"WELL, I HEARD NEIL YOUNG SING ABOUT HER..."
Marge,"WELL, I HOPE NEIL YOUNG WILL REMEMBER..."
Marge,"He was a singer in the sixties, like The Archies and The Banana Splits."
Marge,"I'm a little worried. This part of the county is unincorporated. Just to be safe I'm going to dial ""nine-one"" on my cell phone."
Marge,A tea house?!
Marge,Wanna go inside?
Marge,No.
Marge,No.
Marge,No.
Marge,No.
Marge,No.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,You haven't had any tea.
Marge,Stop the showcase!
Marge,"Well, we could bike to the tea shop and have some cake."
Marge,"You know, honey, I've really started to look forward to our little bike rides."
Marge,"Ooh, such respect! You could grow up to be a doorman!"
Marge,Uh... she died.
Marge,"Well, Bart, I guess that's it. We'll have to go back to our separate things."
Marge,You... invited me... to your treehouse? Wow -- that's like Bruce Wayne letting his mother into the Bat-club.
Marge,So... is that standing water?
Marge,I think I might be able to turn this treehouse into a teahouse.
Marge,And I threw out all your old comics!
Marge,Just kidding. Today's mom knows to seal 'em in Mylar so you can never read them again. Never ever again.
Marge,Where are you two going?
Marge,Uh-huh. And how will this affect your job at the power plant?
Marge,"Oh, well, we're off to buy a new tea set. Have fun!"
Marge,Me neither. Oh my God! I took the salesman's pen. I'll be right back.
Marge,"Oh, Ba-art!"
Marge,Aren't they jazzy? They match the new curtains we hung in your treehouse!
Marge,"Here, try yours on. I got you a child's large because your tummy's getting kind of bloopy from all the cakes we've been having. Somebody here likes princess cakes."
Marge,"Bart, are you having a fight with your boyfriends?"
Marge,No!
Marge,"Hello, Bart. Just so you know, I sold our bike."
Marge,Really? Could we do a duet?
Marge,"Let's see... what would be a good duet? Hmm... ""Just The Two Of Us""... ""You And Me Against The World""... ""Ebony And Ivory""..."
Marge,I'm singing a song with Bart tonight.
Marge,"Well, now I'm not so sure about the bells on the painter's pants."
Marge,Don't call me mother! My name is Mom! And my son is no mama's boy!
Marge,"Bart, you are a wild heck-raiser. And I don't want to see you turn into that."
Marge,"Your job isn't to worry about me, it's to give me things to worry about."
Marge,SWEET HOME ALABAMA / WHERE THE SKIES ARE SO BLUE
Marge,I thought it was arm wrestling.
Marge,Bart... Lisa... we've got to get to the mall before it closes.
Marge,"If I give you money, how is the gift really from you?"
Marge,Here's a ten. Make your own card.
Marge,"Oh Captain, you're so handy!"
Marge,"Lisa, sweetie, I think your father would like to put your book up on the fridge where everyone can see how nice it is."
Marge,She's not going to get over this quickly -- I know women.
Marge,You what?!
Marge,"Homie, you might score more points if you didn't wear that Salamander suit. You look like the mascot for some horrible Southern college."
Marge,What's that smell?
Marge,Did you just vomit in that suit?
Marge,Have you cleaned that suit once since you got it?
Marge,I'd better wash that thing. It's hard to know where the suit ends and you begin.
Marge,No!
Marge,This house has such beautiful wainscoting.
Marge,I read an article about it at the tire store. Did you know it's not named after someone named Wayne Scott?
Marge,Tea? In the parlor?
Marge,This is my husband Homer.
Marge,"Homer, please! We're about to have tea!"
Marge,"No, I don't. I'm still upset about what happened today. I don't have many friends and when I finally start to make some, you ruin it!"
Marge,I'm going out for some air.
Marge,I guess I'm not meant to have friends.
Marge,Johnson's Water Seal.
Marge,The nationwide social organization for women of a certain age?
Marge,What are you doing today?
Marge,"Would I?! Now let's see... Homer cut up my wedding dress to make a badminton net -- which he never uses, he spent my last three birthdays in jail, called out his bowling ball's name during sex..."
Marge,"For your information, I am now a junior member of the Cheery Red Tomatoes."
Marge,"Oh, you guys make everything fun."
Marge,"Bye, ladies. You can text-message me any time."
Marge,How cute. He tried to stay up but he just couldn't make it.
Marge,"Tammy, I'd never have had the courage to skydive if it weren't for you girls."
Marge,"Ooh! Well, now I really hope my chute opens!"
Marge,I feel a happiness I've never felt. I not only have friends... I have a hat to prove it.
Marge,You're joking. You've gotta be joking.
Marge,You're not joking. Any other surprises?
Marge,"I'm sorry, I can't steal. Not even from Mr. Burns."
Marge,"When I joined, I never thought we'd be robbing people."
Marge,"Okay, okay, okay, I'm in!"
Marge,Oh... uh... uh... bird watching.
Marge,That's my special skill?
Marge,I thought you liked my hair.
Marge,All I wanted to do was join a group of women who wore the same outfits.
Marge,Don't be so sure.
Marge,I'll really miss you guys. I'll never forget the three activities we did together.
Marge,"Wow, this is special."
Marge,"Ooh, marriage!"
Marge,"Gee, I wish we could explore a little more of Italy."
Marge,We've passed the Ponte Vecchio bridge three times. I think we're lost.
Marge,It doesn't cover mortadella.
Marge,Excuse me... Mister Mayor... they say you speak English?
Marge,"Hello. I'm Marge. This is my husband Homer, my daughters Lisa and Maggie and my son -- Bart Simpson."
Marge,"Bob, you haven't told your wife about all the terrible things you've done?"
Marge,"Bart, Bob is a family man now. You can't be a bad person if you have a family."
Marge,Here's a cute fact. This sausage shop has been grinding the same family of pigs for six hundred years.
Marge,Uh... well...
Marge,No wine for her -- she's only eight!
Marge,"Bob, your generosity and abondanza have touched our hearts."
Marge,It's obvious why Bob is a vaunted pillar of your community.
Marge,He deserves to be hailed at this wing ding.
Marge,Uh-oh. He's getting that stabby look.
Marge,Vendetta means... vendetta!
Marge,"Boy, that Sideshow Bob goes from zero to murder awfully fast."
Marge,"We're in a foreign city, with no car, being stalked by a killer. I feel like I'm the Bourne Identity!"
Marge,That's Sideshow Bob!
Marge,"Oh, Homie, isn't Venice romantic? This gondola ride was a wonderful idea."
Marge,Where's Reverend Lovejoy? He's never been late for Christmas service.
Marge,Get him outta here!
Marge,CHRISTMAS IS A FAMILY DAY
Marge,Really?
Marge,I'VE STILL GOTTA BAKE MY CHRISTMAS PIE!
Marge,"Merry Christmas, Homie. I think you're really gonna like this."
Marge,"I knew you'd forget, so my gift to you is a gift for you to give me."
Marge,"Come on, we're going to that store! Before the next commercial makes me do something else."
Marge,"I've never noticed that sign before, and I'm a very good noticer."
Marge,"They can't charge me for something I use every day. What's next, a spatula tax?"
Marge,"Voila! Which is French for ""ta da""!"
Marge,What the Hello Kitty?
Marge,Tire spikes?
Marge,They blocked my shortcut!
Marge,"I'm trapped -- like the ""L"" in a B.L.T.!"
Marge,No!
Marge,Hoo boy.
Marge,"Lisa, I'm not sure that letter is ""age appropriate"" reading. Why can't the government edit our mail like other countries?"
Marge,"Uh-oh. ""I know I'm just a lifeguard, but I want you to run away with me. If you don't reply to this letter, I'll know that you've chosen to stay with Abe. But I know in my heart that the baby you're carrying is mine."
Marge,"Love always... 'M'."""
Marge,"Homer, that means your dad might not be your dad!"
Marge,"Homie, what's wrong? Did those pork chops give you a tummy ache?"
Marge,"Homie, you just met this British man. It's too soon to get so emotionally invested."
Marge,"You know, if I was born three months later, emerald would be my birthstone."
Marge,"Homer, look what this is doing to Grampa. We have to settle this question once and for all with a paternity test."
Marge,Oh God.
Marge,"See, Abe, we're still visiting you, even though we have no biological obligation."
Marge,"Well, then you think of something!"
Marge,"Oh Homie, I always believed you were gonna make it, no matter what that pushy casket salesman said."
Marge,Of course.
Marge,Upward Bound: The toughest behavioral modification camp in Northwest Oregon.
Marge,"While the boys are gone, we'll sell all their useless junk and replace it with knickknacks and curios."
Marge,"You know, your father saved every book report he ever wrote. And every one was Stuart Little!"
Marge,Not to mention this Power Point demonstration he did just last week.
Marge,That's right.
Marge,Fine.
Marge,My yard sale is a failure. I guess I'll have to give everything to the Salvation Army.
Marge,I guess -- they're Homer's expired pain medications.
Marge,A dollar.
Marge,Uhh... yeah!
Marge,Bag or keister?
Marge,That's a female replacement hormone.
Marge,That was yesterday.
Marge,What are you talking about?
Marge,"Well, maybe someone else can help you, but I am not a drug grocer!"
Marge,I'm out of drugs! See how much money I made?!
Marge,"Oh. Chief Wiggum. Uh, are you still with the police department?"
Marge,"Homer, I hope you get this. I'm in jail and I need ten thousand dollars bail. Hurry!"
Marge,"Sweetie, if someone's bullying you, you should tell your teacher."
Marge,"Well, tell your regular bully. He won't like it one bit."
Marge,That was your last pair! How did it happen?
Marge,"Aw, Homie."
Marge,Poor Willie. Would you like to spend the night with us?
Marge,"That's not a pan, it's a colander!"
Marge,"Uh... ooh, ooh, it's lovely. I like this part in here... the way it, um, it goes."
Marge,"Homie, what's that?"
Marge,On the back of your head.
Marge,"Well, it creeps me out!"
Marge,"Wow, it glows in the dark."
Marge,I'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head.
Marge,I'd like to get into some blue pants right now.
Marge,What are those doing there?
Marge,He'll sleep tonight.
Marge,"""Local Anahoopi Indians believed this stalactite was the finger of Tsisnajini, their God of pointing down."""
Marge,"Don't worry, Homer. We'll get that fireman who cut you out of that teacup ride."
Marge,"Well, we better start looking."
Marge,We couldn't find a way out.
Marge,"Wait, wait, wait, there's one thing I don't understand here."
Marge,You never had detention all summer.
Marge,Huh? / You knew about the coins? / The coins are down here? / ETC.
Marge,"Homer, you brought us to this horrible place on purpose?"
Marge,That was the most horrible part of all!
Marge,How can you take it? We haven't found it.
Marge,Oh...
Marge,"If you all don't drop your guns and behave, no one gets the gold."
Marge,"And why do you really want it, anyway? Moe, will the gold bring back Edna's love?"
Marge,"Mr. Burns, isn't it more important that you got a child to smile at you?"
Marge,I can see there's only one way to turn you into human beings again.
Marge,And how. But this is different.
Marge,"Reverend, why do we really need this?"
Marge,"Oh, that's the new ""feMac"" ! The computer designed just for women! The ""You've Got Mail"" voice is Susan Sarandon!"
Marge,How can you be sure?
Marge,"There, there... the fact that you tried means everything."
Marge,"Ned, that's so generous. But there must be something I could do in return."
Marge,"...Uh, hmm, let's see, uh just a second uhh... Oh, yeah sure, I'd be happy to baby-sit for Rod and Todd."
Marge,No Rudner.
Marge,"Ooh, Carl."
Marge,"So, you're gonna be ""chillin'"" with me tonight. Do you want to play a game?"
Marge,"Okay, game over -- it's a tie!"
Marge,"What do you think, Maggie?"
Marge,Here's my mask!
Marge,"I'm a ""Star Wars."" Now let's see who you've drawn!"
Marge,I'll help you.
Marge,We had a lot of fun. They're terrific kids.
Marge,"Hmm, well, then maybe I will come by more often. And Homer can spend more time with our kids... he's watching them now!"
Marge,What's wrong with your teeter-totter?
Marge,Chocks?! Why don't we try it... freestyle.
Marge,Homer! We're not in high school.
Marge,Maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.
Marge,"Well, maybe we can take your mind off things by studying for the S.A.T.: ""Snuggles And Tickles."""
Marge,"Ned, I know you like to worry, but these boys are never going to get self-confidence unless you let them try things for themselves."
Marge,I thought they might enjoy it if I took them here.
Marge,"Everything's covered in foam. And it's owned by a corporation, so you know it's safe."
Marge,Where's Bart? I haven't seen him since you came home.
Marge,I didn't say that.
Marge,I could never think something that horrible.
Marge,Sorry I asked.
Marge,"Lookin' good, Rod!"
Marge,"Ned, are you checking up on me?"
Marge,"I'm sorry, Ned. I never thought this would happen."
Marge,I am not an unfit mother!
Marge,"She's kissing his boo-boo! That's it, I'm going in."
Marge,"Excuse me, Mrs. Toot, I need to talk to you mother to mother."
Marge,"While you were living the glamorous life of a TV chimp, I was raising my son. You have no right to take him away from me now. Please, please, give me back my boy."
Marge,Ned... Rod needs to know you believe he can be okay on his own.
Marge,You'd be surprised what he could do if you just gave him a chance.
Marge,I believe he's saying he's okay.
Marge,Maybe he's getting married!
Marge,I'm not wearing a hat!
Marge,That's just a souvenir from an amusement park.
Marge,"Homie, I've been thinking. We have been using this TV for a long time. So I entered a contest where the first prize is a plasma screen TV."
Marge,Now I really hope we win that contest.
Marge,"What are you doing, Homer?"
Marge,"Well, that might be interesting... or it could damage many, many lives."
Marge,"That's very sweet, but I..."
Marge,I'll do it!
Marge,I'll do it.
Marge,"I'll do it! Wait, I wasn't happy with that."
Marge,I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.
Marge,How was that?
Marge,"So, Charles, what do you do for a living?"
Marge,Really? You manage a whole office?
Marge,"Well, that's very impressive. Does that include the people and the furniture?"
Marge,"That leaves ""A"" and ""B"" available for overflow. Well done!"
Marge,That's wonderful!
Marge,He's a very impressive boy.
Marge,I don't get it. Are you saying you're the tree?
Marge,"As long as it's not a knock-knock joke. I always ruin them by saying ""come in."""
Marge,That's funny.
Marge,"Well, you've set me up, for laughs down the road."
Marge,"Oh, how nice for her!"
Marge,That sounds horrible.
Marge,No!
Marge,"Well, I liked the genie part. That was fun."
Marge,"Yes, I could really picture him. With curly shoes. And smoke all over the place. You're a born storyteller."
Marge,No.
Marge,I sure would! Let me just get us some iced tea.
Marge,"Ooh, your toaster takes bagels. How ritzy!"
Marge,What's with the kimono? Are we having LaChoy?
Marge,I thought life preservers only came in orange. Because wouldn't it be hard to see blue in the ocean?
Marge,Where's Ben?
Marge,What an odd thing for a man who's not interested in me to do.
Marge,That song was very nice. How'd you think up so many rhyming words?
Marge,"What? No! Listen, Charles, I don't want to hurt your feelings..."
Marge,"I'm sorry, but I love Homer."
Marge,"Charles, please -- your son might see this."
Marge,"There, there. God, I miss Homer."
Marge,Well...
Marge,"He's loved me ever since the first moment he saw me and he's never stopped. And whatever it takes to make me happy, he'll do it even if it kills him."
Marge,Lisa! What are you doing in the Nutmeg State?
Marge,"Let's go home, sweetie. I'm sure there's a hamper full of Homer waiting for me."
Marge,Me too.
Marge,"Homie, I missed you so much! Put your pants back on."
Marge,"Yeah, whatever."
Marge,"Well, it's a cinch Springfield won't be that lucky city."
Marge,"Homie, snagging a pro football franchise is a big project, requiring a lot of follow-through..."
Marge,"Homie, you've been down here for a week, I really think you need- What the Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise?!"
Marge,Homer do great!
Marge,Maybe Homer brush teeth first...
Marge,I remember him.
Marge,"Grampa, that's the commissioner of football!"
Marge,Where is the baby?
Marge,"Homie, you should give your Dad a call. You can't stay mad at him forever."
Marge,"Grampa, killing yourself is a sin! God wants us to die of old age, after years of pain and reduced mobility!"
Marge,Grampa no!
Marge,"Well, I had my doubts, but Grampa sure looks manly in those leggings!"
Marge,And I don't know who's more handsome: the bull taunter or the bull stabber.
Marge,You've been transferred to India!?
Marge,"Homie, I got you something to read on the plane."
Marge,"It's a book about management, and Lee Iacocca says it's ""definitely, dot dot dot useful."""
Marge,"Should we take all our stuff, or are we coming back on this boat too?"
Marge,"Homie, stop! You're not a God!"
Marge,You're just a sweet guy from Springfield who wanted his family to have a better life.
Marge,It's May!
Marge,He was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.
Marge,Red Lobster?
Marge,"Hurry, my little Puritans -- we must flee England and its insufficiently Puritanical ways."
Marge,Do you have your shipboard entertainments?
Marge,"Finally, we shall bid goodbye to England and its drunken, decadent sinners."
Marge,"Noble sir, you may accompany us to America in my late husband's clothing."
Marge,"Good sir, I do not approve of your fleshly gaze."
Marge,"I see you met our devout leader, Ned Flandish."
Marge,Constance Prudence Chastity Goodfaith.
Marge,"My friends call me ""Marge""."
Marge,Marge Obedience Temperance Sexwon't.
Marge,We're not engaged.
Marge,It's really more of an amiable concordance.
Marge,Oh don't stop -- you're choking him just the way his father used to.
Marge,Good times.
Marge,Perhaps thou wouldst make a good father!
Marge,"Yes, the weather is fair."
Marge,"Homer, I can't believe I was thinking of letting you touch my elbow through a cloth!"
Marge,Look!
Marge,An albatross! It can lead us to safety.
Marge,What'd you call me?
Marge,Who else has a story?
Marge,"Homer, you can tell the third story. Bart will tell the second, which is usually the weakest."
Marge,I'm just trying to take the pressure off of you.
Marge,"Ooh, like the paper towels. Go on..."
Marge,What a fascinating cross-section of humanity! You've got the lonely but loveable loser...
Marge,Maybe not so loveable...
Marge,"Homer, the ship's upside down and hundreds of people are dead!"
Marge,"Homer, what should we do?"
Marge,"Oh, Homie, you did it!"
Marge,They're coming down the aisles! What if they want to interact with me!?
Marge,"Looking through my purse, looking through my purse... keep walking, monkey!"
Marge,All this hoo-haw about girls and math is silly. Women are as smart as men.
Marge,"Why, a woman invented liquid paper."
Marge,"Well, a woman also invented the windshield wiper."
Marge,"Um... I-I think a woman came up with nylon stockings. I mean, probably. We certainly use them."
Marge,"When I was in school, I loved math. Until..."
Marge,Since then I haven't been able to do any of the calculus I've encountered in my daily life. But that's not going to happen to you.
Marge,"Yes, unless..."
Marge,There. You're the perfect little he-she.
Marge,He's one of Bart's friends.
Marge,You never take our kids to the movies.
Marge,I don't know. I'm still frowny with you. Do you really think women are mentally inferior?
Marge,"Goodbye, Mr. Simpson."
Marge,Strangers getting married?! I wouldn't miss it for the world!
Marge,"Homer, this says I've won Homemaker magazine's ""Clean for a Day"" contest!"
Marge,"""A highly skilled professional will come to your home, and clean it top to bottom while you relax."" But how could I have won? I don't subscribe to this periodical."
Marge,Cleaning up before the housekeeper comes.
Marge,"Don't be so naïve, Lisa. Those people all talk to each other!"
Marge,Untidy! Untidy! Untidy!
Marge,Now this is a house that's ready to be cleaned!
Marge,That's her! Don't answer it yet! I don't want that judgmental bitch in my house!
Marge,"Maple syrup, mixed with baby spit-up and shoe scuff! This is going to take my whole arsenal at once!"
Marge,"Et tu, Zud?"
Marge,My head feels like it was punched by a boxing man.
Marge,Two.
Marge,Now I have a question... who are you people?
Marge,"Oh, you're sweet. I'm lucky to have such a kind... Uncle?"
Marge,Wha--?!
Marge,But you're so much more... ravaged than I am.
Marge,"Oh, you seem sweet, but I could never have a favorite."
Marge,"I may have lost my memory, but I'm not an idiot."
Marge,"Ooh, I can't wait to see what kind of home we live in."
Marge,You strangle your child?
Marge,Who are those freaks?
Marge,Why is that drug addict driving a school bus?
Marge,I know what the sun is.
Marge,I know that sound!
Marge,Maggie! My sweet little angel!
Marge,Lisa! My little know-it-all!
Marge,Milhouse! You're Bart's best friend!
Marge,I remember Bart!
Marge,It's so great to have my children back.
Marge,"Nope. I'm sorry, Admiral, but you're still a stranger to me."
Marge,I don't know. Maybe there's something unpleasant blocking my memory of you.
Marge,"Oh, hey Ned! Isn't today your cat's birthday? I remember 'cause she shares the date with Patty LaBelle!"
Marge,"I'm sorry. You seem like... a colorful character, but I just don't remember you."
Marge,What's snuggling?
Marge,"Mr. Simpson, I don't even know you -- I'm not making love with you!"
Marge,You're describing how to parallel park.
Marge,Why can I remember everyone in town except my husband?
Marge,Have you been talking like this for my entire marriage?
Marge,"I don't know. I should give Homer a chance... but on the other hand, I feel nothing for him."
Marge,Mr. Simpson?
Marge,"I've had a lovely evening, Mr. Simpson."
Marge,Know what?
Marge,No! I'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course!
Marge,That sounds horrible!
Marge,No! And I hope I never do! The best thing that ever happened to me was forgetting about you!
Marge,I'm sorry you have to leave. But I just can't think of another way.
Marge,"That works for hiccups, not amnesia."
Marge,Why are we having dinner in Shelbyville?
Marge,A mixer? I don't know -- I am still technically married...
Marge,"Oh, that's so sad."
Marge,Hello there.
Marge,"Wow, that's what I would've said. Well, I would've said ""polite and clean,"" but wow, still..."
Marge,"You've been drinking today, haven't you?"
Marge,I think he's a male gay.
Marge,Me too. I can't believe anyone ever really finds anyone at these things.
Marge,I really know where you're coming from.
Marge,I guess we have to move on.
Marge,I'd love to.
Marge,You really mean that?
Marge,I've got amnesia and I have three kids.
Marge,Mr. Simpson?
Marge,"I may not know much about you, but you sure know a lot of wonderful things about me. And that means a lot to a woman."
Marge,"I still don't remember you, but for the first time since this happened, I wish I did... Homer."
Marge,You drink?
Marge,I remember everything -- you get drunk all the time!
Marge,Oh of course I do! That's why we're such a great team!
Marge,"Oh, I don't..."
Marge,"Oh, and her."
Marge,Uh-huh. And him.
Marge,I don't recognize that name.
Marge,"Oh, I know all them!"
Marge,"Wow, she still works here?"
Marge,"Oh, I always liked that guy!"
Marge,"Oh, and there's a familiar name. And another one. Wait, what-what ever happened to that guy from the network? Did he get married?"
Marge,"Well, I'm so glad there's a show we women can enjoy!"
Marge,What?!
Marge,"Go ahead, Maggie. You're allowed to touch the deadly weapons."
Marge,"Ooh, it's a mugger! I'll hand over all my hugs and kisses!"
Marge,"Okay, be cool. I've got some candy in my purse..."
Marge,"What's wrong, sweetie?"
Marge,"Well, I think it's good to give both ideas a fair hearing. Maybe they could learn from each other."
Marge,"Lisa, lots of times two incompatible things can both be true. My son's a brat but he's a special little guy. Your father says he's at work, but there he is jumping on a trampoline."
Marge,Well then I choose... uh...
Marge,"Well, I might as well see what all the fuss is about."
Marge,"Homer, please."
Marge,"Wow, Darwin's argument is incredibly persuasive. And his ship was the Beagle, which reminds me of Snoopy... my favorite Peanut!"
Marge,"Lisa, I think I have a way to help you at the trial today."
Marge,"Honey, I appreciate the thought, but just leave everything to me."
Marge,"Don't worry Lisa, I've got the answer to your problems right here."
Marge,"Look, Homie, I brought you a beer."
Marge,"Thank you, honey, for opening my eyes."
Marge,"I can't wait to see what evolution will make next: maybe a bird with a people face, or a bear with pants on!"
Marge,That was two seasons ago!
Marge,"Homer, we need those tickets to get in!"
Marge,She's married to Buck Mitchell! I bet that's why she's here tonight honoring America!
Marge,Homer? Homer? Now we have to kiss. The big TV is telling us to!
Marge,That's you!
Marge,"Give me a kiss, Homie."
Marge,Only if he'll kiss me back.
Marge,"For the last time, no!"
Marge,"Hey, that was my iced tea. I just sweetened it to my liking!"
Marge,"Ooh, the baseball-playing man! I barely recognized you without your costume on."
Marge,"I never heard anything about it on the gossip shows, or the blogosphere or in my supermarket check-out magazine."
Marge,"Homer, can I see you in the kitchen?"
Marge,"Homie, I don't think our marriage is so Jim Dandy that we should be counseling others."
Marge,"Well, we have managed to squeeze a lot of fun out of married life."
Marge,"Buck, I guess we can help you out. We'll start tomorrow!"
Marge,"Buck, Tabitha, welcome. We'll start your first marriage counseling session as soon as Homer gets here."
Marge,"Uh, I-I think what Homer means is, why don't you tell us what each of you feels is the problem."
Marge,"Homer, please!"
Marge,"Uh, let's see here... Ooh, here's something the book's previous owner underlined! ""Be honest with your partner about what you're feeling."""
Marge,"Hmmm... try to frame criticisms of your spouse in a positive way."""
Marge,Maybe we should stop here.
Marge,This house is spectacular. You must have had a great view of the riots!
Marge,"O-kay... tonight we're gonna discuss little ways to keep your romance alive. Make time for each other -- an hour, an evening, a mini-vacation..."
Marge,Or take the same limo.
Marge,I always say that.
Marge,That's it! We're outta here.
Marge,"Listen, Bub. We are out of the marriage counseling business. And the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me. But not me, 'cause I think they're disgusting."
Marge,Then I guess you'll do it without me.
Marge,"Crossed arms mean ""no."""
Marge,"Tabitha, what a coincidence -- I was just thinking sad thoughts about you!"
Marge,What? No! No! What? No! What?
Marge,Don't give up on Buck. There must be something about him that attracted you in the first place.
Marge,Let's go.
Marge,Leave him alone!
Marge,All he did was try to help a young couple find their way. Does he really deserve to get strung up for that?
Marge,Cut that out!
Marge,Weren't you just tied up in the blimp?
Marge,Marriage is hard work. But it's worth it -- when you've got someone wonderful like I do.
Marge,"I hope you're happy, Bart. Thanks to your hi-jinx, I have to drive you and your friends to school."
Marge,"One more crack out of you, young man, and I'm showing everyone your baby pictures."
Marge,Carpool!
Marge,"Carpool, Nelson!"
Marge,"Okay, just one more kid to pick up."
Marge,"No problem, I'll just drive up to your house and get it."
Marge,"On the surface, that sounds perfectly pleasant."
Marge,"We'd love to! You know, I've never met your wife."
Marge,"Oh, you're a widower."
Marge,Flowers every week! I wish I was dead.
Marge,Must have cost a fortune.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"I've tried to make those, but they always end up as brownies."
Marge,"Homer, our house is on fire! Help me save the children!"
Marge,"Homer, where did you get that truck?"
Marge,"Homer, Helen Lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck. Could you pick it up?"
Marge,And I can stop looking the other way from what my husband's doing.
Marge,Someone poisoned these meatballs. Homer...?
Marge,Stop calling her that!
Marge,Class all the way.
Marge,"Bart, put that away!"
Marge,"Actually, he's ten."
Marge,"Cymbals... snare... high hat... tom-tom... sticks, mallet and brushes... this is a drum kit!"
Marge,"Homie, look -- he's enjoying it."
Marge,Why couldn't he give up this like he gives up everything else?
Marge,He's just drumming louder!
Marge,"He's gotta fall asleep sometime, doesn't he?"
Marge,Is it in a safe neighborhood?
Marge,Just make it happen!
Marge,Look! Bart's onstage... and he's contributing to the entertainment!
Marge,"Lisa, why aren't you smiling with us?"
Marge,"Look... uh... how 'bout we go to the pound, and get a puppy just for you?"
Marge,What are those noises? They sounded zoological!
Marge,"See, Lisa. We're making progress."
Marge,"I'm very happy for you, Bart."
Marge,"If we can't find a home for those animals, they'll be put to sleep. Your sister's very upset."
Marge,"Honey, what you're feeling is called ""empathy."""
Marge,"Empathy means you're looking at Lisa, and feeling what she feels. Your sister poured her heart into rescuing those animals to forget the pain of being upstaged in jazz. And now..."
Marge,You could do something nice for Lisa.
Marge,Ooh! A J.C. Penney's...used to be here.
Marge,You are not bringing that thing home.
Marge,"Well, if you're through, let's check out that discount book warehouse."
Marge,"""Wisconsin From Above,"" ""Veterans' Day Parades,"" ooh, ""Smiles of Ireland""! Redheaded twins? Their mother must have her hands full!"
Marge,"Well, I like the idea of you as a handyman... and I love the idea of you reading!"
Marge,"Bart, here's a letter from your school!"
Marge,Someone at your school has a life-threatening peanut allergy.
Marge,"The letter doesn't say. But from now on, no peanut products are allowed on school property."
Marge,"Let's see what you've got... Peanut butter and jelly sandwich, trail mix -- starring peanuts, Good grief! More peanuts!"
Marge,"Homie, don't you want to build something with your new fix-it books?"
Marge,Don't you have any follow-through on anything?
Marge,"Oh, the floorboard broke my nightstand."
Marge,"I did it! What's that strange feeling? It's ""of accomplishment""!"
Marge,"Aww, what a sweet blasphemy."
Marge,I could start my own carpentry business. I'm already arranging the clip art for the letterhead in my mind.
Marge,Perfect!
Marge,I'm here to fix your bookcase. You answered my flyer.
Marge,That's right.
Marge,It's so unfair -- I'm as handy as any man.
Marge,I guess people just expect their carpenter to be some fat guy with his butt crack showing.
Marge,"Homer, your butt just gave me a brilliant idea!"
Marge,"A dash of glue, a turn of screw, and a gazebo's built that's perfect for two -- or more!"
Marge,"Uh-oh, switch!"
Marge,I help more than you might think.
Marge,"This is Shirley. Yes, fine, he'll be there tomorrow. Goodbye!"
Marge,"Homie... I think you're taking a little too much credit for my work. I mean, look at your t-shirt!"
Marge,I guess I don't.
Marge,Why does Lenny need a windmill anyway?
Marge,"Switch, switch, switch."
Marge,"Homer, it's time people knew the truth: I'm doing the work and I want the credit."
Marge,"You're gonna have to fix that roller coaster yourself, 'cause I quit... and I'm taking this with me!"
Marge,Darn these counter-sunk molly clamps!
Marge,Your father's finally gonna get exposed as the credit-stealing fraud he is!
Marge,Perfect.
Marge,"Oh my God, he'll kill himself! He'll never hear me say ""I told you so!"""
Marge,"Homer, I was pretty upset with you, but in the end, I... I... I-beam!"
Marge,I forgive you my darling. Get well.
Marge,"As for you, young man: the next time you save your principal, try not to risk your own life."
Marge,I'm gonna go look at the new babies.
Marge,Look! A shooting star!
Marge,That almost tore my head off!
Marge,How could you eat that goo? You don't know what galaxy it's from!
Marge,"Homer! You won't eat my stuffed peppers, but you'll eat our son?"
Marge,Is that the cat?
Marge,I have to be honest with you -- I can't love a four-thousand-ton cannibal.
Marge,The cure to any man's problems is a good relationship.
Marge,Cylinders?!
Marge,"Wait, I have an idea! The Martians are only killing humans, so we should pretend to be animals!"
Marge,What?! Homer! Our son joined the Army!
Marge,"Now listen, Bub. You go down to those recruiters and tell them Bart is too young for the Army. I don't want this to be the only memory I have of him."
Marge,I think she just answers their phone...
Marge,"Homer, with all the things you've done -- go into space, attend clown college, join the Navy -- I never thought you'd join the Army!"
Marge,"Homie, don't do this -- you have a wife and three young children at home."
Marge,So they're not shipping you overseas?
Marge,I'd give anything to hear Homer's voice.
Marge,It's not giant and it's not in the distance! It's small and it's in our room!
Marge,Don't worry. I have a secret weapon -- one more powerful than any gun.
Marge,A phone tree.
Marge,"Hello, Helen? I'm calling about the recent destruction of our town. Well, I have a little plan to fix their wagon."
Marge,We're going to dump it in the water to get the army drunk.
Marge,"Colonel, we're here to discuss the terms of your surrender."
Marge,Don't you dare go limp!
Marge,"All right, but no combat."
Marge,"Hustle your bustles, gang! We're going to the Senior Olympics to root for Grampa!"
Marge,"Kids, grab a fold."
Marge,What's with the lined composition book?
Marge,"Seventy-two lousy events, and Grampa hasn't won a single medal."
Marge,I wonder if the dog thought about us while we were gone.
Marge,"Homer, we can't scuttle like crabs for the rest of our lives."
Marge,Dear Pus Bag...
Marge,See.
Marge,"Lisa, I'm sorry you got a bad grade on your ""Moe and tell."""
Marge,"Homer, don't drink and drive!"
Marge,"Lisa, grab your sightseeing shoes! We're going Vermonting!"
Marge,That's so wasteful.
Marge,"Oh, you should be ashamed! Your father works very hard to put lobsters on our table. Every night, he comes home exhausted, with his voice too hoarse to talk."
Marge,All those women are so impressive.
Marge,I've been doing the same thing for the last ten years. And all I have to show for it is a clean floor.
Marge,My lega-she!
Marge,I'm glad someone in this house feels their life has meaning.
Marge,"I just wish I could do something to be remembered by... something that says ""Marge was here!"" after I'm gone."
Marge,"The story of my life. They get the popsicles, I get the sticks."
Marge,"Look, Maggie, I made another you! Out of sticky orange wood!"
Marge,I made it myself.
Marge,"Noooo! I mean, yes!"
Marge,Really? You think people would be Kent-rested in me?
Marge,"Why did cavemen paint on walls? Why do you scratch your name on Tupperware? So when you die, something's left behind that says, ""I was here. I mattered. That's my Tupperware."""
Marge,"I'm so glad you like it, Moe."
Marge,"Homie, this sculpting has made me feel so fulfilled. I'm as hopeful and full of life as I was in the years before I met you."
Marge,Well no one's gonna be lonely tonight.
Marge,You're from Texas?
Marge,My own art show?! I'm so happy... do you mind?
Marge,Yee-hah!
Marge,You can't go to work! I need you here for emotional support -- plus you make a small crowd look huge!
Marge,The show starts at three. You promise you'll be here?
Marge,"Homer, where are you?"
Marge,"Well, Homer, you destroyed my artwork and my dreams. Good job. Very thorough."
Marge,"Oh, stop. Just stop. You don't care about anyone else's happiness but your own!"
Marge,"Homer, I wanna show the world how I feel about you."
Marge,"They will be! Ready, bullies?"
Marge,"Homer, you wanted a sign that I still love you, so here it is."
Marge,"No, Homer. It's you. My sweet, perfectly imperfect you."
Marge,"Homie, I realized that my most enduring creation is the life I've sculpted with you."
Marge,Now I know that my lega-she is really a lega-we.
Marge,It's in that dumpster.
Marge,Not that one.
Marge,You're the worst husband in the world!
Marge,I wish I'd married Lenny and his friend!
Marge,Don't you spit sunflower seeds at me!
Marge,Now the kids won't bother us during our morning snuggle.
Marge,"Dear Lord, thank you for the physical intimacy we are about to enjoy."
Marge,"Bartholomew J. Simpson, how can you be so mean?"
Marge,I'll whack you with the whole salad set if you don't start thinking about others! You are going to that party.
Marge,"Well, if no one else jumped off the Empire State Building, would you not jump?"
Marge,"Lisa, you're never gonna get a husband by being sarcastic."
Marge,You're getting a husband! And you are going to that party!
Marge,Homie...
Marge,"When you're done putting Lisa to bed we can, uh, finish what we started the other day."
Marge,"Lisa's sleeping over at Janey's. Apparently, her mom makes good mac and cheese."
Marge,"Come on, Homer, let's get the kids out of here. Homer?"
Marge,You really made my daughter's Christmas.
Marge,Why don't you have dinner with us tonight?
Marge,We'll give you a ride.
Marge,"You can't go home tonight! It's cold, it's late..."
Marge,What is all this?
Marge,You have a bigger problem out there.
Marge,I'll tell you why: Christian charity.
Marge,"I promise you, he'll leave after today."
Marge,I will.
Marge,"Listen, uh, Gil... I sort of thought... ya know, you'd be on your way by now."
Marge,"Wait, you don't have a place to live?"
Marge,I guess you don't have to leave till the holiday's over...
Marge,No!
Marge,Yes. One. Involving you.
Marge,Really?
Marge,I guess you can stay a little longer.
Marge,"He's still in need, we have to let him stay. It's what Dr. King would want us to do."
Marge,"Please, just a few more days."
Marge,"It's true -- I do have trouble saying ""no."" It all started when I was seven..."
Marge,"And that's why I have trouble saying ""no"" to people -- even Gil!"
Marge,Uh... hm...
Marge,"Homie, wake up! I rented that negligee you like."
Marge,"Gil, listen. We've been very patient, but I want you to..."
Marge,"Well, just let 'em finish this one song..."
Marge,I'm so sick of Gil... he ruins Thanksgiving... uses my leg razor to peel his carrots...
Marge,Christmas card? I haven't even taken the photo yet!
Marge,That Photoshopping freak!
Marge,Don't you defend him! I want that mooch out of my house right now!
Marge,"That's right! I just found my gumption, and I like it!"
Marge,Marge Simpson is gonna say NO!
Marge,Gil!
Marge,Gil?!
Marge,Gil?!!
Marge,"Gil's gone? But I have a ""no"" inside me that has to come out."
Marge,"Even though Gil left, I still have to kick him out. I need this, or I'll never be able to say ""no."""
Marge,I'll tell you what. We're going to Scottsdale!
Marge,Sure!
Marge,I'll ask these active seniors if they know Gil.
Marge,"I don't care how successful Gil is, he's still a mooch, and I need to tell him off!"
Marge,"Gil, remember me?"
Marge,"Listen, Bub. I have something to say to you, and it can't wait."
Marge,"The only house I'm interested in is my own, which you defiled for eleven hellish months. But now I've learned to say ""no!"" No to your mooching! No to your manipulation! And a big fat no to the Kingsbridge School District!"
Marge,No!!!
Marge,This is so exciting -- watching a movie outside with the whole town.
Marge,We're not gonna make it!
Marge,"Ooh, this is one of our trips to Barnacle Bay! We used to rent a beach house there every summer."
Marge,I was so happy on that island...
Marge,Where's Maggie?
Marge,"It's the famous Barnacle Bay fog! There's even a poem about it! ""Oh cotton candy in gossamer light / Thy soft gray kiss upon my cheek"" It smells like heinie!"
Marge,My childhood paradise -- it's a dump!
Marge,"This was my favorite seahorse. I called him Mr. Funnygoodfeeling... Oh God, someone carved swastikas on your eyes!"
Marge,"Homer, that's too much sugar!"
Marge,"Excuse me, skipper -- this island used to be a paradise. What happened?"
Marge,Yum-yum fish are all we used to eat here. They're the most delicious fish in the ocean.
Marge,Much better.
Marge,"I guess in the end, nothing's as good as you remember."
Marge,Homer! You made an effort!
Marge,"Homer, this is wonderful. Where are the kids?"
Marge,Can I go again?
Marge,What a great day.
Marge,"Well, at least they left your underwear on. That was nice of them."
Marge,My husband meant no harm. There must be some way he can pay for what he did. He's good at opening jars.
Marge,Three years is a long ways away.
Marge,My husband is out there!
Marge,"Oh Homie, I'm so worried. But if I concentrate, our love is so strong, I know I can hear your thoughts."
Marge,Bart was on the boat?!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,How did you make it?
Marge,"I say ""Cool Waves."""
Marge,"Ooo, now that's smooth."
Marge,"Homer, no! Revenge never solves anything."
Marge,"Well, let me tell you a story about a time revenge brought only unhappiness and misery. It happened many years ago in Paris--"
Marge,"No, France."
Marge,There was a happy young family...
Marge,"Oh mon cher, I am the luckiest wife in the entire sixteenth arrondissement! Let us kiss with the tongues."
Marge,"Don't worry, they're still drunk from school!"
Marge,"Ooh, the Count of Monte Cristo! Can we go? We haven't been to any parties since that soirée at the Bastille."
Marge,"Homer, you're back!"
Marge,Homer...
Marge,You killed my husband!
Marge,We were together for five years! Now who's gonna take care of the triplets?
Marge,"For me, huh? What took you so long?"
Marge,"You spent so much time plotting your revenge, you lost everything that really mattered. Come on, kids."
Marge,"So you see Homer, revenge only leads to misery."
Marge,Weren't you listening? I just told you a whole story about revenge.
Marge,You should feel lucky. Not many boys have parents who can afford to take them to the opera every night.
Marge,This alley looks dangerous. I'd better turn my ring around.
Marge,Hoo-boy.
Marge,Shut up!
Marge,Hm...
Marge,"What's the matter, sweetie?"
Marge,"Aw, Grampa. We should take lots of pictures of him while we still can."
Marge,"Homer, is that you?!"
Marge,"Lisa, it was wonderful! I am such a proud Hitachee mother."
Marge,"I just found this note in Bart's room! ""Dear Mom and Dad: Me and my girlfriend Darcy have gone to Utah to get married. F.Y.I., she's pregnant""!"
Marge,I did!
Marge,"Okay, we can trace where the kids are by the charges they made on your card. In Colorado, they charged two hundred dollars worth of bubble gum."
Marge,"""Dingle's Berries"" in Provo, Utah?"
Marge,Then that must be it.
Marge,Stop the wedding!
Marge,"Bart, you're too young to get married! You still make me check the closet for the boogeyman!"
Marge,Homer is so amazing! He can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time.
Marge,"Oh yes. I'm so proud, I feel my chest might burst. Can you edit that? I don't wanna say ""chest"" in a movie."
Marge,"Oh, yes sir... as shocks go, this one's a real zaparoo."
Marge,"Oh... well, yeah, the ointments, um..."
Marge,"Mr. Burns, we're so sorry. The plan was just to use your back yard, and the next thing we know, Mr. Smithers is tied up in a grandfather clock."
Marge,What do you want?
Marge,We let you in thirty-two years ago and it's brought us nothing but pain.
Marge,"No, no, no, no, no! Let's not get crazy."
Marge,"Wait just a cotton-swabbing minute! A good man went to a lot of trouble just to impress you! And I went along with it, because I love him to pieces! And you made him look like a fool. Well, I don't want you anywhere near my house!"
Marge,Now you can cut!
Marge,Homer! Don't kill the foreign man!
Marge,"Oh, Homie! You make each eight-year interval better than the last!"
Marge,Nothing like reading a well-plotted mystery on the beach. It's amazing how they always solve the crime just before they run out of pages.
Marge,James Patterson!
Marge,"Ooh, how about ""Little Bo Peep?"""
Marge,I overslept!
Marge,The family can't start the day without me!
Marge,"Homie, you woke up early?"
Marge,"Dr. Swanson, I'm Bart's mother. I've been saving this money for my husband's breast reduction surgery. But I think this is more important. Would you please see Bart again?"
Marge,"Bart, honey, this is all we can afford for now. If it doesn't work, maybe when you're an adult you can pay some lady to make you happy for an hour."
Marge,You redid the basement!
Marge,'You look at that paneling -- I feel like I'm back in wooden times!
Marge,This basement is a wonderful gift to the family. But how could you afford it?
Marge,Shut up! It's an instructional website! Shut up!
Marge,Nothing like un-tossing a leftover salad. It'll be like new!
Marge,What the heck are these?
Marge,Grampa's driving me crazy!
Marge,Can we at least get out of the house for an evening?
Marge,I invited Selma here to watch Grampa watch the kids.
Marge,Look at Grampa and Selma frolicking in the water.
Marge,"Yeah, and the great prices at that new rib joint were the surprise of the evening."
Marge,"Be nice, Homer. Don't you see how great it is that they found each other? Like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog."
Marge,Nothing solves everything forever like a wedding.
Marge,"Oh, I don't know, he might come home any minute."
Marge,I don't think we're doing this right.
Marge,"It's okay, Homie. You're probably just tired from not doing anything all day."
Marge,This disasterette was a real wake up call. We need to find a way to protect our irreplaceables!
Marge,"Okay, everyone gets to put one precious item in our fireproof safe. For me, it's the family photo album."
Marge,Now we have nothing to worry about in the event of a fire except our lives.
Marge,Nooooo! It's gone! That family album was a record of my accomplishments -- it's like what a résumé is for a man.
Marge,Restage the photos?
Marge,"Okay, we're recreating our series finale party for ""Star Trek: Voyager."""
Marge,Our new photos are back!
Marge,That's why I got duplicates!
Marge,Bart looks so cute as a mighty oak in the school play!
Marge,It sure was nice of NASA to send you up again.
Marge,This is a celebrity scandal! We could sell that photo to a tabloid.
Marge,And they pay big money for photos.
Marge,"Well, it's just about what we need to pay for our fire damage."
Marge,Bart gets another try!
Marge,"Well, I do like the extra money. But I think maybe you should stop exploiting human beings' private misfortunes."
Marge,"Oh, it is not! Watch me."
Marge,Sideshow Mel is in a custody battle? And it's turning bitter?
Marge,Experts disagree on location of Heaven?!
Marge,"Sweetie, maybe it's time you retired from paparazzing. It's never fun to get a taste of your own medicine."
Marge,"Say, Rainier, you're in show business. Would you mind taking a look at this screenplay I wrote?"
Marge,"Well, at least it got made."
Marge,I can't fill out that clipboard. I... don't have email.
Marge,"Fine, I'll log onto Wahoo or Yippy or A-O-K, or Pooka-dooka, or whatever it's called."
Marge,Sunny?
Marge,I never have to look out the window again!
Marge,"Paper towels for sixty-nine cents... sixty-eight cents... sixty-six cents! Kids, get in the car! We're going to Pennsylvania!"
Marge,"Six hundred twenty-nine thousand results. Wow! And all this time I thought ""Googling yourself"" meant the other thing."
Marge,It's our house! But what's that thing?
Marge,Everyone can see you! Get inside!
Marge,Just put on a towel!
Marge,"That internet has it all. Today I found I had the same birthday as Randy Quaid, I MapQuested a great new route to the armory, and I got a list of local houses where I'm not letting you kids trick or treat anymore!"
Marge,"I sent everyone I know an e-card for St. Patrick's Day... but not one person wrote me back! Maybe if I hit ""Refresh""..."
Marge,Still nothing. But maybe now. Or now. The only thing that changes is the banner ad.
Marge,Earthland Realms?
Marge,"For amusement only... ""Credit card information may be sold to Korean gangsters""..."
Marge,Let's see -- what kind of goofy goobly should I be?
Marge,Whoa! Look at those bazooms!
Marge,Who designed this character? Probably a man...
Marge,"I can make her look any way I want -- let's see... hair: blue, shoes: sensible, body type: Olive Oyl."
Marge,Face: other.
Marge,"That's better. Now, let's role... play!"
Marge,Okay... activate my level seven power stones... wield the orb of oblivion... And zap!
Marge,Hm... needs more goat soul.
Marge,What are you kids doing up so late?
Marge,I was on the computer all night!
Marge,I played a day and a night!
Marge,I should get some sleep...
Marge,I better check on my elf-self!
Marge,"Ew, I can't watch this."
Marge,My son is an evil knight! The most successful evil knight in all the Earthland Realms! Not bad.
Marge,I'd like that very much.
Marge,I was killed... by my own son.
Marge,How could you kill your own mother?
Marge,I think I'll go to bed.
Marge,Who cares? I'm dead.
Marge,Wait'll I tell the other moms you gave two-thirds of your life force to save me. What a good boy.
Marge,"Don't worry, honey. I'll hunt down our friends who murdered you one by one."
Marge,"No, no. I'm fine."
Marge,"Homer, what took you so long? The game's almost over."
Marge,I'm also pleased!
Marge,"I need a dress to wear for my son's big game. He's the star, I'm his mom, and he's my son."
Marge,"Well, he's done very well for someone who came out blue and backwards."
Marge,Not at all!
Marge,Bart's coming down!
Marge,"Good morning, sweetie."
Marge,Was there even a baseball game yesterday? I don't remember!
Marge,Don't you have to get to your job as a mattress salesman?
Marge,"Well, maybe if you go..."
Marge,"I'm sorry, Homie -- I want to snuggle, but I'm just not feeling it."
Marge,You traded our mattress? I had my secret cash in it!
Marge,Who would do this to Bart?
Marge,"Oh, yeah, that's really something."
Marge,But they make me look dowdy...
Marge,My baby!
Marge,You should all be ashamed! Passing judgment on a child for a sports boo-boo! What have you people ever done?
Marge,Besides that!
Marge,"Now, thanks to you, my special little guy will be haunted by this for the rest of his life."
Marge,I always thought that was just a slogan to attract small businesses. But now I know it's the truth.
Marge,Exactly.
Marge,Okay. If you pretend to be our chauffeur at my high school reunion.
Marge,We should stop now.
Marge,I'm starting to feel funny about doing this.
Marge,"Homer, stop that."
Marge,There it is -- ol' bounce 'n' giggle.
Marge,"Reverend Lovejoy, our marriage needs this bed."
Marge,I wish he hadn't cut it that way -- it looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich.
Marge,You really wanna make love on half a mattress behind a billboard?
Marge,"Uh... the batter hit it by accident, not by design."
Marge,"Oooh, the new issue of ""Smothering Mother Magazine."""
Marge,Are Bees Building Hives In Your Diaper Genie?...
Marge,The Deadly Truth About Oxygen...
Marge,Is your baby a suckaholic?!
Marge,Experts see new links between pacifier overuse and low achievement!
Marge,"Maggie. Honey, this is for your own good. Growing up means giving up everything that makes you happy."
Marge,"Maggie, I'm sorry you miss your pacifier. But when a mother makes a decision, she has to stick by it."
Marge,"Okay, okay, you can have it back!"
Marge,Lisa! Stop reading mastheads!
Marge,Where's your father with those pacifiers?
Marge,You make her stop! I've had her all day!
Marge,"Last night, someone ate all the food in the fridge."
Marge,"Homer, I think you dominoed this."
Marge,It was you.
Marge,"Sweetheart, come to dinner."
Marge,That's the fire siren!
Marge,"Just come back alive, okay?"
Marge,"Oooh, leather arms! People just give you this stuff?"
Marge,"Next time Maggie does that in a pool, tell me quietly, don't announce it."
Marge,Just let the chemicals deal with it.
Marge,"Well, I guess every boy should see his father as a hero."
Marge,"Well, uh..."
Marge,You're nothing but a diabolical master thief. The kind that haunts the slopes of San Moritz or the casinos of Monte Carlo.
Marge,"You should've seen the faces of your children when they caught you stealing. Kids, get in here and show your father the faces!"
Marge,You make them stop -- by doing the right thing.
Marge,"That's it, buster -- you just bought yourself ten minutes watching that man make a wagon wheel."
Marge,This winning cornucopia is magnificent.
Marge,Styrofoam?
Marge,I can testify at the trial.
Marge,"Ooh, look! Pine-cone first ladies!"
Marge,Maybe we should split up.
Marge,"No, no, I didn't mean--"
Marge,I was talking about--
Marge,I just meant we should split up to get out of this corn maze.
Marge,Now there must be a way out!
Marge,Eat some corn!
Marge,He needs something with your father's scent.
Marge,He just needs it for walking upstairs.
Marge,"I love Santa's Little Helper, but I don't know if we can have him in our home anymore."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,It's just Flanders. You know him.
Marge,No street curs!
Marge,It says here don't bother naming them. Snakes have poor hearing and only live to strangle.
Marge,"Homer, can you breathe?!"
Marge,"If someone did eat Bart's shorts, they'd have a tummy full of pocket garbage!"
Marge,The school's having a bake sale today! At three o'clock!
Marge,I promised them a cake!
Marge,I've only got twenty-seven minutes! The pre-heat is on!
Marge,All out! I can't make my famous raisin sponge-cake without raisins! Kids love the zing of raisins!
Marge,I saw it first! / You are such a liar!
Marge,You give that to me!
Marge,"Now let's see, twenty minutes at three hundred degrees is the equivalent of five minutes at... twelve hundred degrees."
Marge,Now to make the folded index card that goes in front of the cake.
Marge,Pink frosting fixes everything!
Marge,My cake!
Marge,"Excuse me, excuse me, I'm in the sale! I'm in the sale!"
Marge,"Raisin cake! Who wants raisin cake? Don't worry, it's not too moist!"
Marge,I gave you ten dollars.
Marge,Well all the other husbands don't come home dirty from fighting.
Marge,Here's five more dollars.
Marge,Yes there is!
Marge,"Oh, my special little guy. I'm so glad you're okay."
Marge,Kitty cat!
Marge,Elmo!
Marge,Um... um...
Marge,Watering can!
Marge,What can I say? Maggie and I share a special bond.
Marge,"""School bus..."" ""Bart and Lisa?"" Bart and Lisa are almost home from school! And we have a dentist's appointment at three o'clock! Thanks, Maggie!"
Marge,It won't start!
Marge,I'll just use Homer's Triple A card.
Marge,American Applesauce Association?!
Marge,We're gonna have to run. There isn't even time to stretch my quads!
Marge,Marge takes off in a sprint .
Marge,My quads! Every stride is a nightmare!
Marge,Oops.
Marge,"How you holdin' up, Maggie?"
Marge,Sorry-sorry-sorry!
Marge,We're gonna make it!
Marge,Tell me later!
Marge,"Oh hi, kids. You're just in time to go to the dentist!"
Marge,Don't you love that clean-mouth feeling?
Marge,Yay!
Marge,What'd I miss?
Marge,Which one?
Marge,Shake it! Shake it!
Marge,Where's the hammer?!
Marge,"I invited him to stay with us for a few days. His career is ruined, and I was afraid he might commit you-know-what-icide."
Marge,You'll have to excuse him -- he's been watching a lot of Fox News.
Marge,We have to take in Mr. Brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.
Marge,"Homer, you smell like Chicago. Did you fly there on a commercial airline?"
Marge,Wow. Is it much different from a normal plane?
Marge,"Homie, what's wrong?"
Marge,This is Colby Krause. I hired him to help you improve your life. He'll get you back on a private plane in no time!
Marge,"We're all so proud of you, sweetie."
Marge,Find out if he has a wife! We could double date!
Marge,"So, how was your first day at your new job?"
Marge,Hello?
Marge,"It's bad news, isn't it? I should never get my hopes up. Nothing ever works out for us."
Marge,Really?
Marge,"Look at this business center -- fax, Wi-Fi, teleconferencing capabilities... I'm gonna remember this day for the rest of my life!"
Marge,"Sweetheart, what do you mean?"
Marge,What was that?
Marge,"Homie, what are you doing? You don't know how to fly!"
Marge,There's only one man who could help us now.
Marge,It's Marge Simpson. I need you to coach like you've never coached before.
Marge,"Now you listen here, Bub. We paid you all the savings we had in the world. You could at least tell my husband something encouraging."
Marge,"Homer, you did it! You landed a jet!"
Marge,"I understand, Homie."
Marge,We left her last week and she didn't make it home for dinner!
Marge,"Well, where should we go for brunch?"
Marge,Griddler on the Roof? Thank God It's Fried Eggs? Luftwaffle's?
Marge,Bodacious Frittatas? Buffet the Hunger Slayer?
Marge,Be my guest.
Marge,Forget it! One day a week I should be able to put on nice clothes and have someone bring food to me!
Marge,I'm not cooking!
Marge,And you can cut your own meat!
Marge,Hi... you!
Marge,"Oh Homer, you've gotta try this roast beef au jus."
Marge,"Oh my God! Oh my God! Quick, everyone put on their long faces!"
Marge,Longer!
Marge,Where's Bart?
Marge,That doesn't sound like Homer's usual annoyed grunt.
Marge,"You know, it might be a little more romantic without your entourage."
Marge,"Homer, can't we please be alone? It's our anniversary."
Marge,"See? Isn't it nicer, with just you and..."
Marge,I want you to stop flirting with women.
Marge,"You are out of control! The late nights, the eating! You've actually outgrown your cape!"
Marge,Homie... I miss our alone time. I miss you.
Marge,"Aw, you're sweet."
Marge,We're trapped. Your fans will rip us to pieces.
Marge,"Sir, thank you for saving us. Do you want to come in for coffee?"
Marge,"I couldn't agree more, Julia."
Marge,"That's a great idea! To celebrate, I'll go whip us up some Chex Mix pie."
Marge,"What is it, sweetie?"
Marge,That's nice!
Marge,She's perfect! For the first time since you became an opera star I can finally relax.
Marge,"Chief, I think we should cancel the performance."
Marge,"I'm so tense, I can't enjoy Count Almaviva serenading the intended bride of Dr. Bartolo. I just can't."
Marge,"Well, Arthur Fiedler used to, but I'd better take a look."
Marge,Chief Wiggums! The maestro is the killer!
Marge,"I'm sorry you got hurt, but you learned an important lesson. No one comes between me and my Homie."
Marge,Oh but Wednesday's not good for me.
Marge,"Okay Maggie, say your goodnights."
Marge,"Goodnight, Teddy Bear. Goodnight, Justin Timberwolf. Goodnight, Bedtime Krusty."
Marge,"Goodnight, Maggie."
Marge,"Come on, sweetie. Everyone's going to sleep."
Marge,"All right, I'll make you another bottle."
Marge,"Maggie's so clingy! Homer, hold her while I pour the milk!"
Marge,"Oh, I don't want to bother the internet with my problem."
Marge,"If you're so smart, you do it!"
Marge,CRIE? What does that stand for?
Marge,"Ooo, edu-loving!"
Marge,"Okay, I'll sign up."
Marge,"Well, maybe I wanted another freezer!"
Marge,"Did you hear that, Maggie-wags? You're a queen!"
Marge,I'm what?!
Marge,Maggie's crying!
Marge,One hug can't hurt!
Marge,I guess it's time to let my little girl grow up.
Marge,"Huh. Thank you, CRIE! I'm huh... I'm sorry about the kick. I've never done anything like that before."
Marge,"Maggie, what can I get you for breakfas-- Oh. You did everything yourself."
Marge,"Homer, where have you been?"
Marge,I don't want to live like that.
Marge,"Well, no one's disputing that."
Marge,Maggie's completely independent.
Marge,"At least you need me, sack of potatoes."
Marge,"Homer, you do know what tomorrow is."
Marge,Bart?
Marge,I'm starting to worry about your father.
Marge,He hasn't been home in four days.
Marge,"Well, I guess he told me not to worry."
Marge,"Where are you, Homie?"
Marge,Homie! You're all right!
Marge,"Really? Look at you... so grown up... well, I've moved on too..."
Marge,Are you sure? Hugs are dru--
Marge,Homer! Lisa is receiving the Student of the Millennium Award at school.
Marge,You have to be there -- you miss way too many precious moments in the children's lives.
Marge,"Homer, you cannot miss Lisa's big day. And you have to come sober!"
Marge,Point zero eight sober.
Marge,Point zero nine.
Marge,Deal.
Marge,That old man over there isn't even making a transaction. He just wants someone to talk to!
Marge,"Well, if I know doctors, he's probably golfing."
Marge,Homer! I'm a hostage in a bank robbery.
Marge,"Homer, I have to go. If I don't make it, feel free to remarry -- from anyone on the list in the bulletin board in the closet."
Marge,"Goodbye, my love!"
Marge,"Dwight, use your noodle. If you surrender now, you're only looking at a few years in jail. I'll tell them you're a good guy."
Marge,"Okay. I'll visit you, Dwight."
Marge,I just want to go home.
Marge,I promised that bank robber that I'd visit him in jail. But I just can't do it.
Marge,You said you visited him every night.
Marge,"Well, promises mean more to me."
Marge,"Okay, you gave your word, you're going to visit him, no excuses."
Marge,Ooh! Shlomo's Judaica is having a blowout on dreidels.
Marge,"All right, this time I'm going. I'm really going to visit a bank robber. A man who held a gun on me. Going to see him in prison, where guards will frisk me, paw through my purse, and... Oooh, there's apple picking just up the road!"
Marge,"I really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for Dwight. In fact, I really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for everyone at the prison."
Marge,"Oh my, it's five o'clock! I missed visiting hours."
Marge,Perfect!
Marge,"Look, Lisa. I put new filaments in all our burned-out light bulbs. Your father the millionaire thought we should throw these away."
Marge,"Don't be silly, Lisa. In fact --"
Marge,Damn these sturdy foreign-built phones!
Marge,Hello. Hello?
Marge,Hello?
Marge,"Oh, poor Johnny Stabbo..."
Marge,"Don't give up hope, Johnny!"
Marge,Dwight?! I was just on my way to see you in prison.
Marge,"Okay... they're so buggy, I can't!"
Marge,"Dwight, please, don't do anything crazy."
Marge,"Um, What are we doing here?"
Marge,"Oh, that's so sad."
Marge,Okay. But I-I'd feel better about it if you got rid of the gun.
Marge,Can you at least put it in your jacket?
Marge,"Well this Mom is not going to say bug-eye. I mean, goodbye."
Marge,"Boy, I really feel like a Viking in this thing."
Marge,"Dwight, do something!"
Marge,Dwight? Are you okay?! Dwight!
Marge,"Dwight, that was the most unselfish thing I've ever seen. I'm sorry I didn't visit you before."
Marge,"""You chat up the guard at the gate, while I knife the guard behind me."" I can't do that, Dwight."
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,"You see, the problem is, we've grown apart."
Marge,Another thing... I don't know where you go at night.
Marge,"Well I won't be home either. I'm, uh... flipping over wheelbarrows in case it rains."
Marge,And you have fun at your ridiculous event.
Marge,Love ya.
Marge,You just can't get Russian gangster blood out. Must be something they eat.
Marge,Uh... a blender cozy.
Marge,How was your night?
Marge,"Homie, I made you my ""killer"" lasagna."
Marge,You're a killer for hire!
Marge,How could you not tell me you were an assassin?
Marge,I told you twenty times! You never listen!
Marge,I get fifty thousand dollars a hit -- how much do you make?
Marge,"All those nights I thought you were out getting drunk, you were out killing people?!"
Marge,Stop it! That's my favorite couch!
Marge,"Sweeties, we weren't fighting..."
Marge,"Great. Now they're gonna have tummy aches tomorrow, and where will ""super dad"" be then?"
Marge,I'd like to see you do a guy sometime.
Marge,"Oh, what a wonderful night."
Marge,Hold on -- I still have to caramelize.
Marge,"Bart, go out to the shed and get some more butane!"
Marge,We can't have a space creature living in our house.
Marge,"But some of my best friends are... fine, you can stay."
Marge,I guess you should judge a book by its cover.
Marge,I told you not to mock me at picnics.
Marge,There's a bee on Maggie!
Marge,Homer! The wedding's in twenty minutes! Just pick a tie!
Marge,Why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?
Marge,You don't know what color my eyes are?
Marge,No peeking. I'm wai-ting.
Marge,"You really don't know, do you?"
Marge,No.
Marge,Fine. Since the color of my eyes isn't important to you then you don't get to see them until you remember!
Marge,"So you're good at noticing dress colors, but not the eyes that make your dinner!"
Marge,"Why does every kid who stays with us bring ""mommy meals""? So I put pineapple in my potato salad. Live a little, huh!"
Marge,"And until they do, you can stay here."
Marge,Stop naming things!
Marge,Then go to Moe's!
Marge,Why don't we do something special for you -- get you all snazzed up.
Marge,No! Don't talk like that! There's always hope.
Marge,Our anniversary!
Marge,"I'll krump with you, sweetie pie."
Marge,"Oh Homie, I'd forgotten that beautiful song you wrote for me."
Marge,"Bye, Bart! Enjoy your funny books!"
Marge,"Look Maggie, I'm Wonder Woman."
Marge,"I've lost my perfect twenty-six, twenty-six, twenty-six figure."
Marge,Never compare yourself to a standee.
Marge,I'd better join a gym before I go from hippy to hippo.
Marge,"Ooh, L.A.! This could be the gym for me."
Marge,"Who thought walking could be so difficult? Well, I'm sure everyone else is having trouble too."
Marge,Maybe I'll just hit the showers.
Marge,I wish there was a gym for us regular ladies.
Marge,"""Rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame""."
Marge,We have a family.
Marge,Switch stations!
Marge,When is Straightman gonna pop the question?
Marge,"Oh, you don't want to hear about my boring old day."
Marge,"Well, the first inspirational speech of the day was by the woman who climbed Mount Everest and got everyone else killed."
Marge,That's okay. I don't care that you don't care. Go watch your thing.
Marge,I sure am!
Marge,Really? But I'm so used to my old one.
Marge,What's gotten into you?
Marge,I'm going to the successful ladies room!
Marge,"Homie, I'm back!"
Marge,You remembered I like romance!
Marge,You also remembered I like flattery!
Marge,"Homie, you look good!"
Marge,Let me get a good look at you!
Marge,What are you hiding from me? Is it chocolate?
Marge,Whoa! Those buns are poppin' fresh!
Marge,And I'll just fold this old sweaty blanket and put it in the closet.
Marge,"Listen, Homer, I gotta be honest with you..."
Marge,I appreciate you trying to become more attractive for me. But the truth is... I'm way too successful for you now. I'm gettin' me a trophy husband!
Marge,Okay.
Marge,The doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted. And I said no. But I did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man I love.
Marge,"Well, maybe I could. But every time I look at you, I see the same adorable boy I fell in love with."
Marge,"Without the commercial interruption, I could really follow the story. TiVo, you've got a season pass to my heart."
Marge,"Ooo, Opal!"
Marge,"Here's a message for you: Ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop!"
Marge,I think I'll speed through the cheering.
Marge,"Oh TiVo remote, you've changed my life."
Marge,"I've gotten so much accomplished: I saved ""Lost"", watched all of ""Rome"" in a day, and got through ""Two and a Half Men"" in two and a half minutes. Then I ran out of space and had to choose between ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""Schindler's List."""
Marge,Keith Olbermann?!
Marge,"Oh, lighten up. You TV fat cats have plenty of money. My cousin Maureen saw you flying in Business Class!"
Marge,Of course.
Marge,Stop it! Stop it!!! I'll watch the commercials!
Marge,"I'm honoring America's advertisers. Then we're going to buy some toothpaste, lease a new car, and vote ""yes"" on Prop Eighty-Seven."
Marge,Impossible! Their commercial featured a talking frog.
Marge,Eh.
Marge,Yowza!
Marge,That's odd -- there doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Marge,"Bart, I know this is nuts, but try to look sad."
Marge,"Well, I guess the rest of us should pay our respects."
Marge,"Homer, your behavior is heinous."
Marge,...anus! ...anus! ...anus!
Marge,"Milhouse, have you seen Bart?"
Marge,"Well, this time I think Sideshow Bob is finally locked up for good."
Marge,"Stop, Homer! Please!"
Marge,"Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way. We were planning a surprise party for you."
Marge,This magic marker's running out of ink.
Marge,I'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.
Marge,"Stop, Homer! Please!"
Marge,My eye!
Marge,"Homie, this is your party!"
Marge,"Hmm, okay."
Marge,"Because I didn't want him finding out about the party. I mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring Sarah, and I just don't care for that woman."
Marge,Aren't you going to drink?
Marge,Don't you remember what today is?
Marge,It's the first of the month. The day you promised to start your new diet.
Marge,I'm just really worried about your weight. Bart says that we got a call from NASA and your gravity is pulling satellites out of their orbit.
Marge,But it comes from a true place...
Marge,This election is on every channel.
Marge,"That's what you said about yellow fever, and that was no fun."
Marge,I wonder who that could... beeee!
Marge,Stop all this pandering!
Marge,"Speaking of disasters, have you seen this? Springfield Dodge bought too much inventory, and they've only got one weekend to get rid of all the '07s!"
Marge,"Lisa, I'm sure this Wiggum-arole will blow over -- you have to have faith in the wisdom of the average voter."
Marge,We wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd just paid the heating bill!
Marge,No!!! That's my memory box!
Marge,"Hey, parents are allowed to keep some secrets."
Marge,There is a part of our past that we haven't told you kids about. A turbulent part.
Marge,But our happiness was about to unravel just like Kevin Costner's career: because of the postman.
Marge,"Anyway, I was growing to admire my professor more and more..."
Marge,"Homer's perfect for me! Just look at this note: ""I miss you."" Aww..."
Marge,"Whatever, Homer and I had the wrenching task of dividing up a shared life..."
Marge,"Unfortunately, as I later learned, that wasn't heroin. It was insulin."
Marge,Homer really did need those injections.
Marge,"Homer, stop!"
Marge,You don't have to tell the kids everything!
Marge,Well that professor did teach me one good lesson -- Homie is where my heart is.
Marge,I can't wait to see my Valentine's Day surprise!
Marge,A carnival? What's so romantic about this?
Marge,This is a terrible Valentine's Day.
Marge,Romeo and Juliet? Arthur and Guinevere? Brangelina?
Marge,"So that's the end of the story, huh?"
Marge,"All right! This is a story of two dogs with a love so strong, no hose could separate them. I call it Shady and the Vamp..."
Marge,"Kids, knock it off. I'm uncomfortable driving your father's car as it is."
Marge,What the?
Marge,Stop it! Stop it!
Marge,"Honey, this is how I save money on ketchup and mustard."
Marge,"No, I'm kind of embarrassed about it."
Marge,Did you just unlock the car from here?
Marge,"Come and get me, you syrupy stack of man-cakes."
Marge,Jeez Louise. Are you okay?
Marge,It's your new diet!
Marge,"Your lack of bedroom pizzazz last night started me worrying. So I hired this nutritionist, Betsy Bidwell."
Marge,Homie... have you been cheating on your diet?!
Marge,Searching for evidence. I know your father's cheating on his diet.
Marge,"Now that's enough, you each got one in."
Marge,"Out of the house, kids! I have to make an adult phone call."
Marge,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
Marge,This is my husband...
Marge,I think he's been Sneakering on his diet.
Marge,"I didn't use to mind it when he'd lock the bathroom door and snack off, but when he's getting it regular, night after night after night..."
Marge,I'm sorry I'm so emotional.
Marge,"So, how was your outside time?"
Marge,That quick talking is never a good sign.
Marge,It's four o'clock on a Saturday.
Marge,The load is on the road.
Marge,What's up?
Marge,Homer Jay Simpson!
Marge,"Zack, you're not trying to help our marriage, you're trying to split us up! I'd rather have a chubby hubby than a sexy exy!"
Marge,"Aw Marge, if there was a reality show called ""Fat Guys Who Really Love Their Wives"", not only would it be an enormous ratings success, but I'd be the first one on it."
Marge,"A ballet academy here in Springfield?! Move over, Europe!"
Marge,"Lisa, have I ever shown you my Shattered Dreams Box?"
Marge,It's upstairs in my Disappointment Closet.
Marge,"There were so many things I wanted to do in life that I never got a chance to do: doctor , safecracker , stethoscope sales lady ... none came to pass. But the thing I really wanted to be, ever since I was little, was a ballerina!"
Marge,My bosoms came in and ruined my balance.
Marge,They came in one at a time.
Marge,"No, I'm pretty sure you'll have your dad's boobs."
Marge,"Wait, you mean she danced well, into her seventies? Or she danced, well into her seventies?"
Marge,"I think you've got a point! Homie, I'm gonna be a dancer!"
Marge,Boring!
Marge,"Look, Lis! I'm as supple as ever!"
Marge,It won't go down!
Marge,Uh-oh.
Marge,Teach?
Marge,We accept!
Marge,Chazz Busby says you're really making progress! Do you need more leg warmers?
Marge,"Well, the important thing is, someday I'll be watching my little Marge dancing at Lincoln Center."
Marge,Of course -- you're Lisa. Lisa the dancing Marge girl.
Marge,"Oh Homie, I've been so happy lately. I'm completely fulfilled, both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet! Now what did you want to say to me?"
Marge,"There's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing. Look at me, I'm glowing!"
Marge,"Homie, Lisa's dancing has made me really, really, happy."
Marge,Who was that?
Marge,And I realize it's wrong to try to live your career dreams through your children.
Marge,"I'm taking you to your home, before you wreck mine!"
Marge,You live here?
Marge,"Well, at least she's got a friend."
Marge,Get in!
Marge,Are you calling me fat?
Marge,"Listen, I'm sorry I called you all those mean things like, oh, I don't even remember..."
Marge,She turned down Lenny... and Carl? That's like someone who doesn't like hamburgers or hotdogs. What could make her hate men like that?
Marge,So that's it. She's been burned by the most important man in her life... her father.
Marge,"Lurleen Lumpkin has a hole in her heart, and I'm gonna fill it."
Marge,"I've talked to over five hundred men named Lumpkin... everyone at Lumpkin, Lumpkin and Rosenthal Associates, an Asian or Pacific Islander named Cho Lum Kin..."
Marge,...but still no sign of Lurleen's dad!
Marge,"Hello, are you Royce Lumpkin?"
Marge,The father of Lurleen Lumpkin?
Marge,"She's thirty-four, and she's having a rough time!"
Marge,She needs to see you right away!
Marge,I made that hug happen!
Marge,No suicide axe!
Marge,MY BODY WASH IS ESTÉE LAUDER...
Marge,I'm really worried about Lurleen.
Marge,And Major Marge!
Marge,"Lurleen, you're giving your Dad too much power over the way you feel about yourself. Stop getting your self-esteem from the men in your life."
Marge,"Uh, yeah..."
Marge,There's only one person in the world who can tell you what to do. And that person is right here!
Marge,"No, no, that's just our old Christmas decorations."
Marge,"Yes! It's time for you to take control of your own destiny. You're not a doormat, you're a door prize!"
Marge,"Well, you're very welcome, Lurleen. Of all the women who've hit on Homer over the years, you're my favorite."
Marge,"If you ever come near Homer again, I'll strangle you with your own hair extensions. That's right, I know."
Marge,Every week we have to buy something else to save that transforming clown that morphs! I want you to watch a show that isn't just one long commercial!
Marge,"You two have been bombarded with enough commercial images! Lisa, I've got a big bunch of black bananas. You know what that means..."
Marge,"And Bart, you go with your father to Shelbyville to get the beanbag chairs re-beaned."
Marge,"Honey... we'd love to, but... a prize-winning bull is thousands of dollars."
Marge,We're putting a stop to this right now!
Marge,"All right, I've got an idea -- but it'll take a lot of sewing."
Marge,Stop the wedding!
Marge,Bart is a ten-year-old boy. He still sits in the driveway and pretends to drive the car.
Marge,"I'm sorry, Bart. But sometimes your mom knows best."
Marge,"Sweetie, don't you think your Mom might have a trick up her sleeve?"
Marge,Trust me.
Marge,Roger that.
Marge,"Okay, have fun at the Laughter House. Now I'll just turn off my phone to save the battery."
Marge,"Okay Lisa, I'm turning my phone back on to see if your father is ready to be picked up. Huh, I have over four hundred text messages."
Marge,"Lisa, honey, just because you're a girl doesn't mean you can't join in the fun. Maggie and I are washing the soiled foam fingers."
Marge,"Lisa, what are you doing?"
Marge,I love documentaries! Especially the one that came with our lawnmower.
Marge,Although it was suspiciously pro-lawnmower.
Marge,"Homie, she's not making a snuggle film."
Marge,"Ooo, ""Regularsville."" Sounds like my kind of place!"
Marge,"Ooo, ""Candyland."" A great family game is now a great family movie!"
Marge,"I get it -- every title means the opposite of what it means! Then I bet I'll love ""Chernobyl Graveyard!"""
Marge,I didn't.
Marge,We never get more than one move into this game.
Marge,"Thank you, dear."
Marge,"Lisa, how could you?"
Marge,"Sweetie, I'm usually your number one fan. But, call me old-fashioned, I usually don't like movies that humiliate my family in front of the world."
Marge,Thank God they're not jeering at us anymore.
Marge,No more Simpsons movies! One was plenty!
Marge,"We know you love us, honey -- even though sometimes you show it in a ""quirky"" way."
Marge,"We listened to music radio in the car... and, since you kids behaved, we'll pick one fun thing to do here."
Marge,"For once, we'll do what Maggie wants."
Marge,None of you kids ever remember any of the nice things we do for you.
Marge,Food?
Marge,Shelter?
Marge,Clothing?
Marge,I'm used to buying my critters pre-made. How does your store differ?
Marge,I'd stay away from poodles. They give the dog... ideas.
Marge,The door's open! I think someone broke in!
Marge,"Homie, what's going on?"
Marge,"Come on, Homie -- your mom wouldn't have wanted you to stay in bed forever."
Marge,Say something comforting.
Marge,"Homer, look what I found with your mother's things."
Marge,"Maggie, that's the same Garry that filmed your birthday party. Remember, he brought his girlfriend and they got in a fight."
Marge,"Hmm, it smells like concerts!"
Marge,"Excuse me, I think I'm holding up better than you are. In fact, I've got energy to spare."
Marge,"My purse is made of hemp -- if we burn it, the ""silly smoke"" will mellow out those guards!"
Marge,I thought she gave you her rebellious spirit.
Marge,Homie?
Marge,"It doesn't work that way, Homie."
Marge,My son's a good-for-something!
Marge,It's clown trouble. That's your responsibility.
Marge,"Yeah, well, we're adding clowns."
Marge,Fine.
Marge,This was such a pleasant St. Patrick's Day till the Irish people showed up.
Marge,Urchins!
Marge,They took my cupcakes!
Marge,"Thank you so much, Mister..."
Marge,"Marge Simpson. Well, Mr. Farrelly, the least I could do is offer you a cupcake."
Marge,Me? A professional baker's employee? Imagine how different my life would be!
Marge,"Here we are at school, kids."
Marge,Cakes!
Marge,I'll do it!
Marge,"I already don't! Homer, I've got great news!"
Marge,"Well, um, thanks, but I've been wondering... why do you only have me make spheres, rods, and half-moon shapes?"
Marge,Oh my God! This is an erotic bakery!
Marge,How could you not tell me this is an erotic bakery?!
Marge,"Marge, calm down. For as long as there's been baking, there's been erotic baking. It fills a need, and harms no one."
Marge,Harms no one? Explain that to... well what about... I think you forgot about... Hmm...
Marge,Well... okay.
Marge,"Oh, Homie. I got you something too."
Marge,A sterling silver picture frame -- with pictures of our kids in it.
Marge,How dare you?!
Marge,"Sorry, sorry muscle spasm."
Marge,Oh no! Those were for Mr. Smithers' commitment ceremony!
Marge,"Homie, I've got a confession to make: I'm an erotic baker."
Marge,I hid it all in the one place you'd never look.
Marge,"Homie, what do you say we go to bed? You, me and the cake?"
Marge,"Don't feel too bad, Homie. You'll be free tomorrow. And I used all my new baking skills to make a special cake to remind you of me."
Marge,"Sweetie, we can't afford to get you a cell phone. As it is, I'm buying frozen peas on installments."
Marge,That laughter sounds like the result of misbehavior. Bart! How did you get a cell phone?
Marge,Whose phone is this?
Marge,Okay. Milhouse?
Marge,You did the right thing.
Marge,Bart Simpson's stolen cell phone -- can I help you?
Marge,"I'm sorry, Mr. Leary. Sometimes it's hard to be a parent."
Marge,"I don't think I could. Mr. Leary, I'm so sorry. I'll send you your phone back right away."
Marge,"Of course, you're Denis Leary!"
Marge,Shouldn't you just be happy for their success?
Marge,"Okay, here goes. Bart, I have something for you!"
Marge,"Well, sweetie... I know I said you couldn't have a cell phone, but, in these days of stranger dangers and sinister ministers, I think it's important that we're in touch."
Marge,Like a big-mouthed bass.
Marge,"Okay, Bart went to the comic book store."
Marge,Bullies!
Marge,That's a hard hat zone!
Marge,Bartholomew J. Simpson!
Marge,What are you doing at this construction site?!
Marge,"Honey, keeping track of someone because you love them is not wrong."
Marge,It shows you care.
Marge,Look at Bart go! He must be running away!
Marge,"Oh my God, he's out of frame! Zoom out! Zoom out!"
Marge,He's circling the Shelbyville Bird Sanctuary.
Marge,Bart's been moving nonstop all afternoon. Maybe there's too much sugar in his Sugar-Frosted Candy O's.
Marge,Pull over -- Bart's in this field!
Marge,Are we ever going to find him?
Marge,"Bart! Where are you, Bart?"
Marge,No. All I care about is finding my boy. And then I'm never letting him out of my sight again...
Marge,Those walls do look safe.
Marge,Oh my God. You've taught me a valuable lesson!
Marge,So I can't always be there for Bart. He's got to learn to take care of himself.
Marge,I think it's time for us to go home.
Marge,Thank God you're okay!
Marge,We were gone for two weeks!
Marge,I just made a thirty-seven hundred mile car trip. I need to wash up.
Marge,"Hmmm, all the groceries seem to have been balled up in anger."
Marge,"Now Homer, boys will be boys."
Marge,Where's Bart? We're gonna be late for Lenny's party.
Marge,Bart Simpson! Did you just spray water on me?!
Marge,"Dang that Bart! Thanks to him, I have to wear my backup dress which makes my arms look fat."
Marge,Why can't our son just behave?
Marge,That was unforgivable. But I'm beginning to think that Bart's bad behavior is more than just a phase.
Marge,"No flicking boogers, and no driving into trees!"
Marge,"Wow, Lenny went all out!"
Marge,"Bart, I've had it with you! I'm taking away all your TV privileges."
Marge,"Okay, then videogames."
Marge,No more non-dice board games.
Marge,I just did.
Marge,"I made it with Cheetos, just like you like it. If the sauce is too thick, I can add more root beer."
Marge,Maybe he's going through... certain changes.
Marge,"Homer, it's not a real paper -- it's a rubber chew toy!"
Marge,"Bart, honey, I saw you didn't like your dinner, so I thought you might like pepperoni pizza with the crust cut off."
Marge,"Now let me tuck you in, fluff your pillow and sprinkle a little fairy dust to keep the monsters away. It's cinnamon! Nightie-night, sweetheart."
Marge,SCRUBBING YOU / IS EASY 'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN PRE-RINSED / AND WHEN YOU'RE COVERED WITH GOO / THAT'S WHEN I'M SCRUBBING YOU! / SCRUB-BUB-BUB-BUB-BUB / SCRUB-BUB-BUB-BUB-BUB...
Marge,I don't like the look of those air quotes.
Marge,"Now, we tuck in the tummy, the tushy and the tootsies."
Marge,"Homie, let's pick up those hitchhikers. They don't look like the stabby kind."
Marge,I said they were thrill-crazed drug seekers. Don't put words in my mouth!
Marge,Aw... young love.
Marge,Of course we were.
Marge,I don't know...
Marge,"Well, we thought we'd wait a little while."
Marge,"Um, how long have you two been married?"
Marge,"Homer Simpson, I would be delighted not to marry you."
Marge,"Homer, that was rude and shortsighted. Patty and Selma have the map."
Marge,That's the fuel gauge.
Marge,You haven't said you're sorry.
Marge,Can we use your phone?
Marge,We'll stay for one hand roll or two Nigiri -- then we have to get back to the kids!
Marge,That's how low you can go!
Marge,Why are you dancing with that strange woman?
Marge,Well then she can have you all to herself!
Marge,"Homer Simpson, I wish I'd never met you!"
Marge,They have a pe-dal car.
Marge,"There's absolutely nothing to worry about! I'm in my own room, being chaperoned by an actual Christian."
Marge,But I can't take a dress from a man who looks so good and smells so clean.
Marge,Really? Me? You did?
Marge,Pumps are shoes! That explains a lot.
Marge,I'm just happy you're talking again. You didn't say a word for forty-five minutes.
Marge,We should be getting back to the party.
Marge,"Alberto, I'm not sure if this is such a good idea."
Marge,My husband!
Marge,Uh... the same thing you're doing here.
Marge,"We sure did. Rekindle, rekindle... Okay, let's go."
Marge,Fine. But I don't want to sleep in the same room with that chest.
Marge,"Okay, but first the chest."
Marge,"Homie, what's taking so long?"
Marge,Homie?
Marge,"Homer Simpson, you devil!"
Marge,"Homer Simpson, you devil! But I think we should unpack first..."
Marge,"Homer, those are our wedding bungees!"
Marge,I can't believe one of the most beautiful moments in our marriage is based on lies!
Marge,She's not here!?
Marge,You make me feel that way too.
Marge,What are you doing?
Marge,Don't be silly. Our marriage can weather any storm -- just like this tree.
Marge,Take my hand!
Marge,"Homer, our marriage isn't on a piece of bark! It's in us! Now take my hand!"
Marge,/
Marge,"Me neither, Homie."
Marge,"I know. We had a fight, we were both tempted... we're human. The important thing is, we love each other."
Marge,Have fun!
Marge,"Another religion? You know, you're just gonna drop the whole thing when you go to college and get a Jewish boyfriend."
Marge,Homie... I'm not sure about this new business of yours. You're making it too easy for couples to break up just because they hit a rough patch.
Marge,That's one of your breakup lines!
Marge,What would have happened if there was someone who could break us up every time I had my doubts about you?
Marge,Homie?
Marge,Well maybe...
Marge,"Lisa, sweetie, I'm honored that you choose my name, but it's not that great. Back in high school, the boys used to call me Marge ""BOOB""-ier."
Marge,Really? I never knew that.
Marge,"Jackie ""O."" Like Spaghetti-o's. I thought that was where her money came from. Look, why don't you cheer up by doing a New York Times crossword puzzle, huh?"
Marge,It might be a fun way to kill a couple hours.
Marge,"Gee, they sure give the Christmas spirit the bum's rush around here."
Marge,"Okay, remember our deal: everyone gets to return one Christmas present with no hurt feelings. I'm returning this kitten calendar."
Marge,What have you done with the old ones?
Marge,"Homie, it's very open-minded of you to have Bart's Muslim friend's Muslim family over."
Marge,"So, how did you two meet?"
Marge,You're teaching Bart a terrible lesson of intolerance!
Marge,"Well, I want you to go over to their house and apologize!"
Marge,"Homer, I'm sure you didn't see anything. Go to sleep."
Marge,"Lisa, add another name to our Christmas card list. Next to our Jewish friends. Where is Lisa?"
Marge,Uh-huh...
Marge,Never being a grandmother?
Marge,"Lisa, I don't like this at all."
Marge,Stop Milhousing your sister!
Marge,Now take it off before they sting you!
Marge,I don't know. All it takes is one troubled loner.
Marge,Okay. One night.
Marge,"Listen Lisa, I was trying to think of a way to help your bees and I remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town."
Marge,"Your bees will have plenty of room in this old greenhouse. Plus there are flowers, and it's near a prison so they'll have a place to sting people."
Marge,Now you know how I'll feel when you go to college.
Marge,But he'll be gone a lot repairing refrigerators.
Marge,...So Lisa asked if her new friend could stay for dinner! She's finally doing something the book said she would!
Marge,Are your parents okay with that? They've never met us.
Marge,"Okay, you two. Lights out."
Marge,Lisa? Do you want to be best friends?
Marge,"Say ""yes"" say ""yes""!"""
Marge,Woo-hoo!
Marge,"Great! Here are a few ""best friend"" tips: compliment her hair and shoes. If her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it... and--"
Marge,I just said that.
Marge,"Now remember, Juliet's family is very classy, so be on your best behavior."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"These be mini-pizzas made from dragon eggs, your majesties."
Marge,"Who is this ""mom"" of which you speak?"
Marge,I'm just trying to--
Marge,Lisa has been seeing an awful lot of her new friend.
Marge,There are limits to how much two people should be together.
Marge,I'm Bart Simpson's mother. You think you've got any tricks I haven't seen?
Marge,"Bart Simpson, age three."
Marge,I wonder if Lisa has threatened the Model U.N. with her rice tariff yet.
Marge,"Oh hiya, Martin! How's the Model U.N.?"
Marge,Are you saying Lisa's not there?
Marge,"Lisa ran away, and it's all my fault! If I'd just let her continue her obsessive relationship with that troubled little girl, everything would've been fine."
Marge,"A ""castle""... I know where they are!"
Marge,No!
Marge,You probably would.
Marge,Just go!
Marge,Let's go get my little girl.
Marge,Sounds promising so far!
Marge,"You got a letter all the way from New York City, and that's something!"
Marge,Your father's just jealous because Vance was our class president in high school.
Marge,"Don't feel bad, Homie. I married you! And you're a million times better than-- here comes Vance!!!"
Marge,Hey!
Marge,"Homie, you're barely eating."
Marge,I see a hair.
Marge,"Homie, please, nothing good will come of this."
Marge,"Forget it, Marge. A girl like you could never land a Homer Simpson."
Marge,Oh my God. He's talking to me.
Marge,Only if it lasts forever.
Marge,I can hardly believe this is real.
Marge,You used protection. We never had any!
Marge,"Well, that's what's missing. Our lives would be horrible without the kids."
Marge,"Homie, please come inside."
Marge,Don't open this one again.
Marge,Just stop.
Marge,"Sweetheart, I think you'll feel better after we take a little walk..."
Marge,Oh really?
Marge,...of school!
Marge,It's the first day of school!
Marge,Yeah!
Marge,Free at last! Free at last!
Marge,"Oh Homie, the insurance bill is due today. Can you make sure to mail it?"
Marge,Homie! What are you doing home so early?
Marge,You mean back to the poor house?
Marge,I don't want anyone to ever get hurt.
Marge,"We can discuss it later. Right now, while you're here, you can help host my book club."
Marge,Oh my God! Oh my God! We're totally liable!
Marge,"No, sweetie. At this point in a marriage, a wife should know what her husband can do and what he can't. Who was I to think you could mail an envelope?"
Marge,Homie... every year this party gets a little bigger. I'm afraid it's growing out of hand.
Marge,Your majesty... did you remember to invite Ned Flanders?
Marge,"Homie, do you know anything about this?"
Marge,I think we should go see our mortgage broker.
Marge,That number's so big it has a comma!
Marge,And what will I cook that soup on?
Marge,I worked so hard to make this house into a home. And now somebody else is just going to take it.
Marge,Why are you here? You already own a home.
Marge,"I know I shouldn't get too attached to a building, but... that's where Lisa took her first step... the kids' height...Homer's weight..."
Marge,Ned! You bought our house? Why?
Marge,"Ned Flanders, I can't believe what you doodily-did for us."
Marge,"Come on, kids! Let's take our stuff back inside."
Marge,"Homie, the faucet won't stop leaking."
Marge,"Ned please, you're our guest."
Marge,"Oooh, hot comes out of hot... it's like I'm dreaming! Thank you, Ned."
Marge,"Um... Do you have time to look at a few other leaks, faulty wires and dangerous mold conditions?"
Marge,"Well, let's see what else is in the job jar."
Marge,It's irresistible. You ask him to do something and he does it. He's like a
Marge,genie.
Marge,"No, no. I'm just happy I can finally serve this cake."
Marge,Our House is Up to code.
Marge,Ned! I think we have a gas leak!
Marge,He won't come over!
Marge,"Homie, I think it's an eviction notice. We're gonna be homeless, like Lucille Ball in ""The Stone Pillow""!"
Marge,"You know, it says here that Grampa has to remain in the house, but we don't. How about a family outing?"
Marge,Oh my God. We're out on the street!
Marge,"It's okay, Homie -- you can have my viewer."
Marge,There'll be another one in North Yemen in 2027.
Marge,I can't miss out! Just one little peek.
Marge,It's beautiful!
Marge,You guys have treated me like a princess. Every day's been like the first ten minutes of Mother's Day!
Marge,"Goodnight, Bart."
Marge,"Homie, I haven't held Maggie all day. Can you hand her to me?"
Marge,"Ooo, mommy's little baby is getting big and chubby! Who's a chubby baby?"
Marge,But that doesn't mean that you can't have a little dinner.
Marge,Hm. You're not usually this greedy.
Marge,"I'll be right in, Lisa!"
Marge,"Good night, Lisa. Good ni-ight!"
Marge,"Oooo, jazz!"
Marge,Keep going and I'll scat.
Marge,Skee-biddy-bob-boo! Dot-doobiddy-dum-doo!
Marge,Give me my baby back!
Marge,A mother knows!
Marge,"Maggie, you're coming home with me!"
Marge,"Well, it would be nice if the first thing I saw was a world at peace..."
Marge,You're even more beautiful than I remembered.
Marge,I'm sorry. But I know God would never ask a mother to sacrifice her child for the good of the world... again.
Marge,Maybe I'm just being selfish. I don't know.
Marge,"I'm sorry for fibbing. Tell you what -- if you don't like it, you can complain all the way home."
Marge,"Ooh, look! A welcome mat that tells you your weight!"
Marge,What is that soothing sound?
Marge,If I'm more relaxed I'll be a better mom! Can we? Can we?
Marge,"Wait a minute, who am I pleading with?"
Marge,Uh-oh. We're starting to attract swingers.
Marge,Maybe we should get out now.
Marge,I feel like we're forgetting something.
Marge,We'll make it up to you. We'll do something you've always wanted to do but never got the chance.
Marge,"Bart, if you hate Belgium so much, maybe I should take your Tintins away!"
Marge,While your father and your grandfather have a drink we're going to see sights.
Marge,That's not how a family vacation works. We do things together while your father has fun without us.
Marge,"The Giant's Causeway is the result of a volcanic eruption. Well kids, isn't that an informational fact? Kids?"
Marge,Come back here!
Marge,"They say if you kiss the Blarney Stone, you get ""the gift of gab."" Which is great, but I'm not sure I like the idea of getting a gift in return for kissing. What kind of a message is that for Lisa and Maggie? Those are my daughters. But on the other hand, America doesn't have any stones worth kissing -- except for Stone Phillips. Do you have one of him here? If so, he's our your him."
Marge,I want to talk to Howard.
Marge,Like it was yesterday...
Marge,Kirk and Luann split up...
Marge,"So Homer, fearing we would do the same, preemptively filed for divorce..."
Marge,"But then you remarried us, and we were as solid as ever."
Marge,And I think Apu got lucky with my sister.
Marge,Who are you calling an old lady?
Marge,It's not a big deal. We'll just go to City Hall and get married there.
Marge,This isn't the most romantic place to get married.
Marge,Hello?
Marge,"Whatever you say, ""Lance."""
Marge,"Homer, what's going on? The violin, pants with a crease, why?"
Marge,"Oh yes, Homer! Yes!"
Marge,"Oh, it's beautiful. But that's an awful lot to pay for a dress I'll only wear once."
Marge,Uh... a princess?
Marge,That's for a child's birthday. We're going to get this one.
Marge,No rockets! You can pick the frosting.
Marge,We'll take lemon.
Marge,"Okay, I want white roses at the altar, red roses along the aisle, and blue roses in the centerpieces."
Marge,"Well, did he take all the blue roses with him?"
Marge,"All right, people, I want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation."
Marge,"There is no ""we"" in wedding!"
Marge,I can't believe you're ruining the second Thursday before the wedding!
Marge,I can't believe you told Lenny and Carl they could bring dates! 'Cause they're not even coming to the wedding!
Marge,Because their R.S.V.P. cards arrived one day after the deadline!
Marge,Bridezilla? A combination of bride and Godzilla? How could you say that? More like you're a... King Wrong!
Marge,"Okay, okay, everyone back off! I want to see myself."
Marge,A pimple! Not on my day you don't!
Marge,"Okay, it's go time."
Marge,Dim the lights.
Marge,Cue the band.
Marge,And... release the groom.
Marge,"Homer, that's you!"
Marge,We are now eleven seconds behind schedule!
Marge,Homie?
Marge,I can't believe Homer left me at the altar.
Marge,It's all my fault: Homer wanted to serve those little cocktail hot dogs. But no. I had to have spring rolls! They taste like nothing!
Marge,I'm afraid I'm just... Ms. Simpson now.
Marge,He's right here.
Marge,I'm just happy you're back. Now let's get that chain off you.
Marge,"Oh, I've missed your nonsense."
Marge,"Homer, one thing I've learned is that you don't need a fancy wedding when you're marrying the man you love."
Marge,Just what I always wanted.
Marge,Blue roses!
Marge,You're supposed to be spending time with your daughter.
Marge,You want to know the score? I'll tell you the score.
Marge,"Here's the score, Mister:"
Marge,Your daughter barely knows who you are!
Marge,Maggie.
Marge,Can you at least bring a sweater for Maggie?
Marge,Those are two different people!
Marge,"Oh! Okay, I'm coming."
Marge,"Come on, Maggie. Have some grapefruit."
Marge,You've been spending so much time with her.
Marge,"Wait a second, Marge: do you really want to use your baby as a tool to spy on your husband?"
Marge,I wasn't talking to you.
Marge,"All right, Homer. Let's see what my baby's been up to."
Marge,"She's beautiful, Moe."
Marge,"Okay, no more delays. I've got to watch this."
Marge,"Homer Simpson, you are a strong finisher."
Marge,"Lisa is a little young to be taking ""happy pills."""
Marge,"What's your angle, Mister?"
Marge,"Oh, Bart, I don't care that this is just an act. You've finally become the boy every mother dreams of: a girl."
Marge,"Jenny, it's amazing what you've done with my son."
Marge,That's it! We're getting you off the meds!
Marge,"Man, I love Saturdays! Finally, I can have fun with something I bought for myself -- a new water heater!"
Marge,Almost there...
Marge,Five more water heaters and we get a free water heater!
Marge,Huh? A mysterious door!
Marge,It's like a sauna in here!
Marge,It is a sauna in here. Must've been put in by a previous owner. This house is full of surprises. But this is the first good one.
Marge,I can't wait to tell everyone!
Marge,Maybe I'll keep this to myself for a while.
Marge,"No it won't -- if he wants me to do something, he'll just write it down!"
Marge,That'll be our Christmas card this year!
Marge,Try these beets. I boiled all the red out.
Marge,"Well, I..."
Marge,Noah. I like that name. No-ahhh. Noah. Noah!
Marge,Am I?
Marge,Blabby's gonna build an Abbey. Groovy.
Marge,"What's wrong, Homie?"
Marge,"Well, I know a place in this house where you can really relax."
Marge,"No, I gave that to the homeless shelter."
Marge,"Well, I'll make you forget all about it."
Marge,"Feeling better, Super Dad?"
Marge,Ooh. The label is all in lowercase.
Marge,It's like drinking e. e. cummings!
Marge,"Excuse me, I'm feeling a little... over-hydrated."
Marge,Gotta find a place to tinkle.
Marge,"Schools have bathrooms! And I'm a woman, so my going in unattended won't cause a panic."
Marge,Janey.
Marge,Ooh! That's Bart's class.
Marge,This school has really gone downhill.
Marge,That's an awfully crowded classroom.
Marge,The only person getting an education here today was me! In how bad it is!
Marge,I want my kids in a decent school!
Marge,...And because of cutbacks they were combining math with P.E. They were playing dodge book!
Marge,"What if we got a small apartment there? We wouldn't have to live in it, but we would have a Waverly Hills address."
Marge,Thank you!
Marge,The what?
Marge,It's so kind of you to live there so our kids can go to a better school.
Marge,You just have to stay there until that psychopathic school inspector makes a surprise visit. You can come home when the heat's off.
Marge,Please just stay there till Bart graduates high school.
Marge,"Wow, your first day at the new school! Lisa, have fun! Bart, don't!"
Marge,"Ooh, I'm doing it!"
Marge,Definitely a cup.
Marge,Let's go.
Marge,We don't need a bed. We're not gonna be sleeping.
Marge,"You know what a girl likes, mister. So, can I see you again?"
Marge,I love Tapas! It's like appetizers for a meal that never comes!
Marge,Homie?
Marge,A key to your apartment!
Marge,"And I've got a present for you, but you'll have to wait till we're back at the apartment."
Marge,Surprise! I redecorated!
Marge,"You don't need a Wii now that I'm here. Because you and me make ""us."""
Marge,We can talk about that after brunch with my mother.
Marge,Where have you been? We have mirrors to hang!
Marge,Without me? How'd you get there?
Marge,Without me?
Marge,Fine! You can have your key back!
Marge,"I got it halfway-- Oh, it went back."
Marge,Hurry! Get out the kids' stuff!
Marge,Yeah. A house in the suburbs does sound pretty nice right now.
Marge,"Although, I am gonna miss our little love nest."
Marge,My daughter's here for her first mani-pedi.
Marge,"A woman can be smart, beautiful and powerful. Like Queen Elizabeth the First! She had it all, except the most important thing."
Marge,"No, a husband!"
Marge,The year was 1588.
Marge,Four hundred years before Kirk Gibson would hit his famous home run.
Marge,Queen Elizabeth ruled over all of England.
Marge,Every eligible bachelor in Europe wanted her hand in marriage.
Marge,"Lisa, you are going to look so pretty."
Marge,And she lived happily ever after?
Marge,That's nice.
Marge,All I have are some dry-cleaning coupons.
Marge,"Lisa, let me tell you the story of a great woman held back by a not-so-great husband."
Marge,Macbeth!
Marge,"Out, damn'd spot! Out, I say!"
Marge,I wouldn't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role.
Marge,I thought I was marrying a man who could play Macbeth.
Marge,I think Mel would be happier as an understudy. A six-feet-understudy.
Marge,"Wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem, letting ""I dare not"" wait upon ""I would?"""
Marge,Tonight the Springfield Community Playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star... Dr. Hibbert as Banquo?!
Marge,He's the one getting the good reviews! Which makes him the next one you've got to kill.
Marge,Screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.
Marge,Macbeth!
Marge,"""In last night's 'Macbeth,' the best performance was Barney Gumbel as Duncan, followed by Duffman as MacDuff, Lenny Leonard as Lennox, Eddie and Lou as the two soldiers without lines, then last and least, the lead, Homer Simpson."""
Marge,All I heard was more names of actors you haven't killed. Unless you're not man enough.
Marge,Why did he have to kill everyone in their costumes?
Marge,"No, it was Homer!"
Marge,"No, I just encouraged him."
Marge,"Oh Homie, you were brilliant. I knew you could do it. I knew it..."
Marge,Now nothing will stop you from taking on all of Shakespeare's greatest roles: King Lear... Hamlet...
Marge,Othello... Richard The Third...
Marge,"Henry the Fourth, Part One... Henry The Fourth, Part Two..."
Marge,Henry The Fifth... Titus Andronicus...
Marge,"That's it, three stories. That's what we always tell."
Marge,"Ooo, ""The Fountainhead."""
Marge,"So, anyway, this is the story of Maggie Roarke, an architect who refused to compromise."
Marge,Maggie's genius and creativity far exceeded that of the others. And I'm not just saying that 'cause I'm her mother.
Marge,"But her teacher, Mr. Ellsworth Toohey, wanted every child to conform."
Marge,He would not let Maggie's creativity flower:
Marge,Maggie grew up to be a world-famous architect.
Marge,Her building became one of the wonders of the world.
Marge,And on the very top floor was a daycare center...
Marge,Where every child was free to follow their dream. Because nothing is... Maggie! Get away from there!
Marge,Bad baby!
Marge,Guess who the garden club elected president?
Marge,No. I lost.
Marge,"Oh, Homie... take your shirt off again."
Marge,"There's less of you to love, but I love you even more."
Marge,What was that?!
Marge,Ooh.
Marge,Come and get me.
Marge,I think you may have put on a little weight.
Marge,"I'm glad you've got such a stimulating substitute, but I'm worried about Mrs. Krabappel."
Marge,Yes!
Marge,"I googled ""girls having fun,"" and after wading through ninety-seven thousand pages of porn, I found ""crazy bowling."""
Marge,That's odd. There isn't a single man in this whole bowling alley.
Marge,Where's your brother?
Marge,Bart Simpson! I'm glad your father isn't here to see this!
Marge,"Bart, let him go!"
Marge,God didn't give you legs so you could use them as scissors!
Marge,"Ultimate Punching?! ""Ultimate"" makes everything worse!"
Marge,"Otto, don't you have a sack to hacky?"
Marge,"Okay, I'm going to put a stop to this ""Ultimate Punching."""
Marge,Uh-huh...
Marge,Uh-huh...
Marge,What else?
Marge,"Nelson, you really have a knack for this."
Marge,Maybe someday you can do Lisa's wedding!
Marge,This goes on for a while...
Marge,"Call me a killjoy, but I think that because this is not to my taste, no one else should be able to enjoy it."
Marge,"We need to take this into the belly of the beast. Mr. Scalper, give me a ticket."
Marge,I'm Marge Simpson and I will not rest until you tear down this septagon!
Marge,"Pleased to meet you, Chett."
Marge,"Guys, please. When you yell like that, no one can hear me."
Marge,"Chett, I'm here to ask you one simple thing: please go out of business and donate all your profits to charity."
Marge,"At least in other sports they're trying to put a ball in a net or a zone. But in this sport they don't put anything in anything. And if they did, I wouldn't want to see it!"
Marge,Really?
Marge,What? That's crazy.
Marge,That flattens my soda pop! You're on!
Marge,"Thank you, Homie."
Marge,"I can't back out. This is for a cause that's bigger than I am. If Gandhi could go without eating for a whole three-hour movie, I can do this. Besides, I'm a woman. He'll probably go easy on me."
Marge,"If I'm gonna open a can of whup-tushy, I'd better get in shape, with some rhythmic gymnastics!"
Marge,"""Beat, Slay, Shove."""
Marge,Is he okay?
Marge,Listen... I'm late for a P.T.A. meeting.
Marge,"""Eat, Pray, Love."""
Marge,Is there someone in there?
Marge,Someone should tell your principal!
Marge,"I can't back out, because if I fight him tomorrow...it'll be a less-violent world for you kids in the future."
Marge,Nobody needs to know that! Skip ahead!
Marge,I knew it!
Marge,That's. My. Son.
Marge,Tap out! Don't make me break your arm!
Marge,"Really? Oh, thank you."
Marge,Okey-doke.
Marge,"I'd just like to say one thing. I only agreed to this fight because I wanted to stop the violence. And sure I got into great shape and met some fun people, but I ended up discovering my own dark side. So from now on, the only thing I'm fighting is this cold I'm coming down with."
Marge,"Well, I wish somebody would've stuck around to hear it."
Marge,Where did they all go?
Marge,"No. Let's go home. We can enjoy some mixed ""marital"" arts."
Marge,Bart ate a tainted burger!
Marge,I guess I could!
Marge,"Now Lisa, you're a vegetarian, but these cows have made a different choice."
Marge,We don't have a panic room!
Marge,I can't shoot her. She's Lisa's godmother.
Marge,That was so noble of Apu to give his life for us.
Marge,I don't see the safe zone anywhere.
Marge,"Homie, where have you been?"
Marge,"No! When we get you to the safe zone, we can cure your father!"
Marge,Let us in. We have the chosen one!
Marge,"Hold it right there, Bub. What kind of civilized people eat the body and blood of their savior?"
Marge,There must be another way...
Marge,"What is it, Moe?"
Marge,He what?!
Marge,"Mm, there's something odd about this beer."
Marge,IT TASTES LIKE... CUDDLING! / IT TASTES LIKE CLEAN CLOTHES!
Marge,IT TASTES LIKE HOT STEAMING COCOA MIXED WITH RAINBOWS...
Marge,"I STOPPED MY CRYING / WHY, I DON'T KNOW / BUT THIS ROSEY, COZY, BUBBLES-IN-MY-NOSE-Y / MAKES ME WANNA HAVE... MO'!"
Marge,I'm still hoping Homie will come back.
Marge,That does sound like Homer.
Marge,"Eh, well..."
Marge,"Oh my God, I've never felt so... uncreeped-out by you!"
Marge,I guess it is time to move on...
Marge,I COULD DO WORSE...
Marge,Homer?! Does this mean you still love me?
Marge,I always have.
Marge,"I call to order this meeting of the ""Springfield Charity Chicks."" As you all know, last year's cake and cookie sale raised one hundred twelve dollars to fight childhood obesity."
Marge,Now who has ideas for this year's fundraiser?
Marge,How 'bout history?
Marge,"I am! The female Tiger Woods of the nineteen-thirties, Babe Didrikson Zaharias."
Marge,Fine. I'll take off one glove.
Marge,"Mmmm, I love this wine."
Marge,"Well, it seems real to me."
Marge,Whoops!
Marge,"Oh, that's wonderful!"
Marge,What's all the hubbub-aloo?
Marge,I've been pin-upped!
Marge,And every month is me! I don't remember doing this! I certainly don't remember doing August!
Marge,No!
Marge,"Homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages."
Marge,How 'bout a little Marge Madness?
Marge,Cuddling's for after.
Marge,"Tomorrow, my love."
Marge,Maybe this will take your mind off work.
Marge,Homie?
Marge,Garden view?
Marge,"Well, I brought a few items to make our night extra-special. Massage oil..."
Marge,"Some lingerie from ""The Horny Hubby""... and ""snuggle"" dice."
Marge,"This one has an action, and this one has a body part. See?"
Marge,NUZZLE... NECK. With pleasure!
Marge,Why don't you just roll me?
Marge,"Dammit, why won't you touch me?"
Marge,Last night was the making it up to me! The most intimate moment we shared this week was my ironing your shirts!
Marge,I can't believe you're gonna spend another weekend with him.
Marge,"Ned, to make up for what happened, I want to invite you and the boys over to dinner tomorrow night."
Marge,HO-MIE... HO-MIE... HO-MIE... HO-MIE... HO-MIE... HO-...
Marge,You two are going out? I thought I told you the Flanderses were coming over to dinner.
Marge,I guess it'll just be dinner for four.
Marge,Hi Ned. Where are the boys?
Marge,"It's fun to cook dinner together. Homer and I never do it anymore. Cook together, that is."
Marge,You could wash this iceberg lettuce.
Marge,Dinner's ready! Dinner's ready!
Marge,"Oh, nothing fancy..."
Marge,Strawberries and whipped cream.
Marge,"Ned, you got whipped cream in your mustache!"
Marge,Your perfectly-trimmed mustache...
Marge,"Ned, there's only one man I should be eating whipped cream with."
Marge,"Homie, you're back!"
Marge,"Boy, that was worth the wait."
Marge,"Oh, I'm sorry, kids. We lost the batteries for that."
Marge,"Oh, darn, the batteries are dead."
Marge,You said you were at a parenting class!
Marge,"Well, I think you're very interesting girls, but from now on, the only witch in Lisa's life is which boy will marry her. Right, Homer? Homer?"
Marge,Oh look how the snow glistens on the tiniest branches!
Marge,What a smart way to spend a snowy day.
Marge,A branch must've knocked out the power lines.
Marge,That runs on electricity also.
Marge,Bart's cooked us a five-course romantic dinner.
Marge,Oh what a lovely evening.
Marge,Maybe we could do both.
Marge,No... we could not.
Marge,"Homer Simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our DVD player."
Marge,Which position should we try?
Marge,"The Yawning Monkey? ""The Pair Of Tongs?"""
Marge,Okay!
Marge,"Uh-huh, and now hand me your neck..."
Marge,Mm-hmm... and swivel that till you hear a grinding noise...
Marge,"A few more minor adjustments, aaand..."
Marge,Bart Simpson!
Marge,"Bart, you've always been a handful, but you've never interfered with my reproductive freedom. Why now?"
Marge,"Oh, Barty, I'm sorry. But your father and I think that three kids is just perfect."
Marge,Remember those hamsters you were going to take care of?
Marge,"And even if we did have another baby, it might not be a boy. It might be another sister."
Marge,That's right! It is!
Marge,"Oh, there's so many photo ops, but I already filled up my camera in the parking lot...parking lot C sign... the tram... a license plate from Canada..."
Marge,"A bird eating potato chips... my feet walking... that boy who got sick on the tram... Grampa talking to a mermaid hedge... the Park Rules in Spanish... a fat baby... Grampa telling a story to a trailer hitch... Oops, I erased them all!"
Marge,That's us!
Marge,"Grampa, no stories! You can come with us, or sit here on the shark bench."
Marge,What a nice note!
Marge,He does all the time. You just never listen.
Marge,Maybe you're not really mad at Grampa. Maybe you're mad at yourself for taking him for granted all these years.
Marge,Time to try out my new deep fryer.
Marge,I don't like this -- real humor comes from people being nice to each other.
Marge,Who wants fresh donuts?
Marge,And I even got rainbow sprinkles!
Marge,Then don't have any.
Marge,YOU LIKE POTATO...
Marge,YOU LIKE TOMATO...
Marge,potato!
Marge,TOMATO!
Marge,LET'S CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF...ICIALLY ONNNNN!
Marge,AND TOAST... VALERIE AND DAAAAAVE!
Marge,"Homie, I'm still a little nervous about performing in front of all those people..."
Marge,Homer! Where are you?
Marge,YOU LIKE POTATO... YOU LIKE TOMATO...
Marge,POTATO... TOMATO... LET'S CALL THE WHOLE THING--
Marge,"Okay, who's ready for a wedding-theme knock-knock joke?"
Marge,Start the joke!
Marge,Who's there?
Marge,"Did I hear ""lettuce?"""
Marge,Lettuce who?
Marge,Lettuce... congratulate the new couple.
Marge,"Homie? Homie, can you hear me?"
Marge,Oh thank God you're okay!
Marge,Seven-oh-seven? That's exactly the moment I was furious at you for missing our toast. And now I'm the one who has to ask... Can you forgive me?
Marge,"The laundry. The machine's on the fritz, and we can't afford the four hundred dollars to fix it."
Marge,That's just what we need! But how are we going to get it home?
Marge,Who's ready for Panini?
Marge,I thought the government sent it to us as part of the stimulus package. At least that's what the letter said.
Marge,"I'm not a dude, I'm a hottie!"
Marge,"So Bart, how's your big school presentation coming along?"
Marge,"Well, I kind of got a clue when I heard that ""ballooning safety"" video."
Marge,You were what?!
Marge,We've got a million dollars?! Screw the toast!
Marge,So we're right back where we used to be.
Marge,Oh my God!
Marge,YOU LIKE POTATO...
Marge,YOU LIKE TOMATO...
Marge,"SO IF YOU GO FOR OYSTERS AND I GO FOR ERSTERS, I'LL ORDER OYSTERS AND CANCEL THE ERSTERS / FOR WE KNOW WE NEED EACH OTHER SO WE / BETTER CALL THE CALLING OFF OFF, / LET'S CALL THE WHOLE THING OOOOOFFF!"
Marge,"Okay kids, time to apply the final ""date night"" touch. Lisa, spray just a hint of perfume on my neck, Bart, you tell me this dress doesn't make me look fat. And... now!"
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,Really? How romantic?
Marge,It's so noisy in here! I can't hear the ad telling everyone to be quiet!
Marge,This isn't fair! I want romance!
Marge,It's not the same.
Marge,"Ooh, ice skating."
Marge,A sport that encourages hand-holding.
Marge,This is what you're like when you don't drink!
Marge,I've been training all my life. I once swept red wine off a white carpet.
Marge,If Homer can join with me.
Marge,"So we'd just thrown a biter, and Homer said to kick harder off the hack. So I did... and I almost fouled the hog line!"
Marge,The realest thing I've ever done.
Marge,"Hey, look who ""slid"" into our ""house."""
Marge,"What's up, Seymour?"
Marge,"Homer, while you were imagining what the Winter Olympics were, Seymour said we were all going to the Olympic trials!"
Marge,He usually stays out like this for about thirty seconds. Want some coffee?
Marge,You love your son. How can you be so hard on him?
Marge,"Well, they should."
Marge,Homie! We're going to Vancouver!
Marge,"Homer, who's that?"
Marge,My favorite subject. I'll go first. Isn't he cute?
Marge,But Homer tries his best.
Marge,Well who made you the coach?
Marge,"Well, Homer's my soul mate! And you don't dump a soul mate!"
Marge,I like to warm up by sweeping behind the snack bar.
Marge,Boo yeah!
Marge,Yes it will. I'll just sweep harder than anyone's ever swept before. Because without Homer I'm a broom without a stone. No use for anything.
Marge,"C'mon, baby!"
Marge,"I'm not horny, I'm mad."
Marge,"I should be, I'm left-handed. I've been using my right hand all these years 'cause I didn't want to seem unusual in any way."
Marge,No surrender!
Marge,Let's give the Olympics a miracle!
Marge,"Oh stop -- it's the journal of a sweet little girl! Keep reading, honey."
Marge,See. All good.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Read a little more, honey."
Marge,Absolutely right.
Marge,"Very good, Bart."
Marge,I made it into a sampler!
Marge,"It's like when your father and I left the movie ""Carrie"" right after she was crowned prom queen! She was so happy -- she'd had a lot of problems, but they were all behind her!"
Marge,"Ooh, good idea. Bart, what are you doing for Black History Month?"
Marge,What happened next?
Marge,"Cheer up, sweetie. Maybe we can find the answer in the library!"
Marge,"Oooh, a cookbook!"
Marge,"""Pork Butt in Cream,"" ""Snout-fried Neck,"" ""Frog Haunch,"" ""Hooves Au Jus,"" ""Possum Pouch Pie..."""
Marge,"This one doesn't sound roadkill-y. And, it comes with a story. ""Many years ago, my daughter, Eliza, brought a runaway slave, Virgil, to the house..."""
Marge,"The patrollers were too fast for Eliza and Virgil...,the patrollers were too fast for eliza and virgil,9

Marge,It was a footnote. See?
Marge,"""Anyway, I was very proud of Eliza, but my husband Hiram had not quite caught abolition fever..."""
Marge,"I don't know what the big deal is. I mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's French. You know, Bouvier?"
Marge,"I'm French, not you."
Marge,"Ooo, a hundred and three! No school today."
Marge,"Then again, there's only one way to get a truly accurate reading."
Marge,"Bart, pants."
Marge,Yup. One-oh-three on the dot. You're stayin' home.
Marge,One month? That's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.
Marge,Thanks for doing the dishes.
Marge,"Y'know -- I think Bart might have too much homework. If they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever."
Marge,"It's okay, Bart. Just do a couple vocabulary words, then come have some milk and cookies."
Marge,Never mind what he said. You just listen to me.
Marge,Bart! Put down those books and go play this instant!
Marge,"Dear Lord, please give my stubborn husband the wisdom to see that I am right as usual."
Marge,There's no such thing as prayer blocks!
Marge,I said he could take a break.
Marge,Don't contradict me in front of our son!
Marge,"Let's have lunch at ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Eggroll."""
Marge,The last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail!
Marge,"Well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!"
Marge,You practiced all day on my birthday!
Marge,You were never going to apologize!
Marge,You're wrong! And whenever you're wrong you just sprout gibberish.
Marge,"I don't mind if you pee in the shower, but only if you're taking a shower!"
Marge,Well then there won't be any sex!
Marge,"I just think when two people disagree, the big jerk ought to apologize."
Marge,I'm going to find my husband. But don't depress the kids.
Marge,I'm sorry we ever fought.
Marge,"Till the two of us are back on track, Bart can fend for himself."
Marge,It's working!
Marge,I'm gonna go paste your heads back into the family photos. I've got them right here.
Marge,"Oh my God, Homie -- we're having a real conversation!"
Marge,Nope.
Marge,"""Mom and Dad, Bart is going to use the old subway to destroy Springfield Elementary!"""
Marge,"And there's a map of the subway system attached. Homer, we've got to stop him!"
Marge,We're going to have to be good parents to our son and work twice as hard on our marriage.
Marge,"Mister, you are grounded!"
Marge,And I'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons!
Marge,Homer?
Marge,I thought you were fixing my brakes!
Marge,You mean... he kissed her?
Marge,Why didn't you just tell him to club her on the head and drag her into a cave?
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,And it means the world to me.
Marge,"That's not Bart, it's Principal Skinner. Bart's sitting right next to you."
Marge,"Homer, I can hear your sarcasm from inside the house -- and the dishwasher's on! What's going on here?"
Marge,"Ned Flanders, you would take our family to the Holy Land just to try to make my husband a better man?"
Marge,"Well, we will take you up on your offer."
Marge,But we insist on paying our own way.
Marge,"And Homer, put on some pants."
Marge,"Homie, just tell them what they wanna hear!"
Marge,"This country's so historic -- for all we know, Jesus could have given a talk in Conference Room C."
Marge,Do you have any safety tips?
Marge,But it says here in the brochure...
Marge,"Shalom to you! Shalom is the ""aloha"" of this place."
Marge,"Oh Homie, you're alive!"
Marge,"But you still have our passports, right?"
Marge,"Oh my God, Homer's gone!"
Marge,What's he gonna do now?
Marge,"Thanks, but you can stop giving the tour now."
Marge,No thanks.
Marge,Okay.
Marge,You people are so pushy.
Marge,No one in this family is hurling rotten anything at anyone!
Marge,And just what might that be?
Marge,"Really? Okay, eat your lunch."
Marge,You said it's your lunch. Eat it.
Marge,Yes! Enjoy!
Marge,Bon appétit!
Marge,I don't see any chewing!
Marge,"Not air bites, real bites."
Marge,"Shopping. Every time this town riots, the malls are deserted. You stay here."
Marge,Play with Lisa.
Marge,"You remember Dylan. You were in ""Toddle Tots"" together."
Marge,Of course you do. Dylan's a... Hm... let me check the invitation...
Marge,Fish theme! That tells me nothing!
Marge,There's gotta be a clue here somewhere.
Marge,See? Dylan is clearly a girrr--
Marge,What kind of a party has two activities? They're just trying to confuse me.
Marge,I give up!
Marge,I hope Dylan likes trucks.
Marge,Dealing drugs? That's impossible. He... he doesn't have the math skills!
Marge,"Bart? Bart, are you here?"
Marge,"That's drug talk! But I could be mistaken. Let me just listen to a little more, out of context."
Marge,"Bart Simpson, are you a drug-o?"
Marge,"Well, can you explain what you were doing in the basement with Milhouse?"
Marge,"Hey, that's pretty nifty. Let me try."
Marge,"Oh my gosh, that's adorable! This one's going on the Christmas tree."
Marge,Homer? You have visitors.
Marge,"Come on, let's go! What are you waiting for? Come on."
Marge,It's making our meter run backwards!
Marge,My smoothie is a lumpy!
Marge,"Homie, maybe this is too much electricity."
Marge,Our wedding china's ruined.
Marge,"Homie, can I talk to you for a second?"
Marge,"Homie, I happened to read about beached whales in Springfield Geographic. It usually does not end well."
Marge,We can't let Lisa get her hopes up.
Marge,Lisa is very sensitive. If something she loves dies in front of her--
Marge,"Lisa, sweetheart -- it's almost dinnertime. Why don't you come home?"
Marge,Tonight let's all draw pictures of what your father just said.
Marge,Does he have a cute accent?
Marge,"Oooh, he sounds just like Paddington Bear!"
Marge,"Lisa, I know kids have been making fun of your blonde hair, so I got you this book from the ""being different"" section of the bookstore."
Marge,"What is it, Ned?"
Marge,Should we inform the Chief?
Marge,"I don't know... I'm starting to think we're prying too much into people's lives, and this room isn't really the best place for Maggie to hang out."
Marge,"That's not Sesame Street, that's a gay bar."
Marge,"Although I guess this would teach her sharing and caring, but... we're going home."
Marge,"Homer, Maggie has to wear that clown mask for Halloween. What's going on?"
Marge,I don't see what's so wonderful.
Marge,"Ever hear of the expression ""Not in my backyard?"" Well, that!"
Marge,"I don't want to get Homer in trouble, but it's just plain wrong to use that blind spot to turn our back yard into a Mecca of misdemeanors!"
Marge,"You guys should go on that cruise. You'll have a great time, and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father..."
Marge,And I can spend my Mother's Day taking care of something I've been putting off for a long time.
Marge,That's something you've been putting off.
Marge,Why do I waste my breath?
Marge,Homer?
Marge,Homer? I'm-- you!
Marge,We're breaking up!
Marge,Homer?
Marge,Homer my Mother's party's starting any minute. Get busy.
Marge,This is my mother's eightieth birthday party and you're not ruining it. You'll have a good time. I invited a friend for you.
Marge,Every time I plan something that means something to me you somehow mess it up.
Marge,You said you'd be home by seven to help with my mother's birthday!
Marge,I'm still mad at you from last night.
Marge,What do you think?
Marge,My mother explained that what happened at the party wasn't your fault.
Marge,"Homie, slow down!"
Marge,"Now that it's empty, who's gonna buy their house? What if someone moves in with two Barts? Or four teenage Barts?"
Marge,Stop that sniffing! It's not for you! They're making the house next door smell like cookies so people will subconsciously want to buy it.
Marge,"Homer, no!"
Marge,"Credenza, credenza, lowboy, sideboard, portmanteau..."
Marge,"And where there's exotic fish, there's gotta be a..."
Marge,Water feature...
Marge,Why on earth do you think that harmless-looking man...is Sideshow Bob?
Marge,"A lot of people sound like Sideshow Bob, like Frasier on ""Cheers."""
Marge,"Or Lieutenant Commander Tom Dodge in ""Down Periscope."""
Marge,"Honey, his name is Walt Warren, and he's a very nice man. He stopped me from driving away with my coffee cup on top of the car."
Marge,Bart?!
Marge,What are you doing?! You're indoors at an outdoor party!
Marge,It's probably a de-boner.
Marge,I can see there's only one way to settle this once and for all.
Marge,Thank you... you're very sweet...
Marge,We better go.
Marge,"Guys, guys, I'm married!"
Marge,The paper's here.
Marge,Is your room clean?
Marge,Good. That'll give me something to do while you're at the game.
Marge,"But that's impossible! If you're the real Walt Warren, who's taking our son to the baseball game right now?"
Marge,"Walt, why didn't you tell your story to the guards?"
Marge,"You have to admit, ""Bart Simpson Will Die"" was kind of open to interpretation."
Marge,"Excuse me, have you seen this man?"
Marge,"Walt, it's a nice face, but I don't think it would drive a professional waitress to lie."
Marge,"Homer, can we please find Bart?"
Marge,"Well, whoever moves in, it can't be worse than having a murderer next door."
Marge,"Ooo, everyone's coming over to congratulate us! Humble faces, kids!"
Marge,Humbler!
Marge,"Lisa, too humble."
Marge,You're home early!
Marge,"Moe's is closed, huh?"
Marge,We can enjoy each others' company.
Marge,Still wanna be at Moe's?
Marge,I didn't see you come in.
Marge,"Well, I don't need much help..."
Marge,But you can keep me company.
Marge,You know what? I'll just cook this later.
Marge,"Um, I'm gonna go read a book."
Marge,That's nice. What kind of favor?
Marge,Hyper!
Marge,"Well, it's been such a... blessing having you around the house, ""making my life easier,"" as you so put it, so I thought you deserved a reward."
Marge,Homie! I thought you were at that sports bar.
Marge,"Well, I am glad you're spending more time with us, but maybe you should get a plumber to help you with that."
Marge,In the mood for another round?
Marge,At least in Hell the heat still works.
Marge,What is it?
Marge,Golf it is.
Marge,"Have fun, Homie."
Marge,Well you can take another -- in forty years!
Marge,You can't even show it in the bar?
Marge,Maybe we're not going home right away.
Marge,"Well, you could get some ice cream, or...spend a week at performing arts camp!"
Marge,Whoops -- didn't time that quite right.
Marge,Did you really think I'd forget? Now have a great time!
Marge,"Aw, you think I forgot you? Babies shouldn't jump to conclusions!"
Marge,Your week's up! Time to go home!
Marge,Perestroika?
Marge,No time! I don't wanna get stuck behind the joggers from the fat camp.
Marge,"You didn't see a boy lose his swim trunks, did you?"
Marge,"We've got plenty of songs in the car, by Maggie's favorite singer: Roofi!"
Marge,Bup-up-up! Safety locks!
Marge,"No appetite, honey?"
Marge,Lisa? Are you in here?
Marge,Is it your laundry?
Marge,"Lisa, look!"
Marge,First we're visiting Grampa.
Marge,"It's not your fault, Grampa. These cards are too slippery. See?"
Marge,Dammit.
Marge,Now remember what Grampa said: you can spend the money any way you want.
Marge,"Hm, I think I'll look for a new handbag..."
Marge,"Ooo, so many celebrities have their own label: Princess Penelope, Booberella, The Real Housewives of Ogdenville, even Scratchy."
Marge,"Ooo, I wonder how much that one is. Gotta look without looking like I'm looking."
Marge,Yes!
Marge,"I'd like this bag, please!"
Marge,Why wouldn't I?
Marge,"Hey, my husband makes good money, and we can certainly afford..."
Marge,"Oh, I didn't realize..."
Marge,I'll take it!
Marge,Is that the cat in there?!
Marge,"Don't worry, Homer -- I'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow."
Marge,Well at least it's a good place to see celebrities.
Marge,"You go ahead, I'll stay here. If I get something on this handbag, I won't be able to return it."
Marge,I suppose I should get something to eat.
Marge,Thank God!
Marge,Homer! Take me home!
Marge,"Stay cool, Marge. Stay cool..."
Marge,I'd like to return this handbag. Unused.
Marge,Thank God! I will never do that again.
Marge,"Homie, you know what happens when you push your luck..."
Marge,"Well, I learned a valuable lesson about wanting more than I could afford."
Marge,"Sweetie, you could still go to McGill -- the Harvard of Canada."
Marge,"Homie, maybe you could do it."
Marge,"You know, someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them."
Marge,No it's not!
Marge,Cut it out! You're upsetting the gravy boat!
Marge,"Lisa, can't you let your brother back on the team? Fly balls and fungoes come and go, but family is forever."
Marge,What about Bart's feelings?
Marge,Why do you say such ridiculous things?
Marge,Mama Bear said 'I'm sure Sister Bear will come to her senses.'
Marge,"Brother Bear said ""Sister Bear is inconsiderate."""
Marge,"Actually, I'm taking you on a ""special little guy super happy fun"" day!"
Marge,You're not going to the dentist!
Marge,Lisa? She wants to talk to you.
Marge,Mike Scioscia! Didn't you get radiation poisoning working at the Springfield Nuclear Plant?
Marge,This is that videogame Reverend Lovejoy said you shouldn't play!
Marge,I still think it's too violent.
Marge,These classic board games are fun and safe.
Marge,"Colonel Ketchup, I say it was you that killed him in the parlor with the letter opener."
Marge,"Oh Homie, what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters."
Marge,"Whew, sure is hot out here..."
Marge,"Homie, help him up!"
Marge,This poor man must've been out there for days!
Marge,He's nothing but hard bronze muscle.
Marge,I'm not really in the mood anymore.
Marge,Poor man. You've been through so much.
Marge,"Oh, Roger! You really know what you're doing!"
Marge,That's crazy talk!
Marge,That is so sweet!
Marge,Why did you do that?
Marge,No it wasn't!
Marge,"No, it was berry-peach!"
Marge,"Please! Homer, I am so sick of this unmotivated, jealous..."
Marge,The pie was poisoned. You were right! I guess we've got to kill him before he kills us.
Marge,"What do you mean, this one?"
Marge,"Oh Roger, would you hand me the suntan oil?"
Marge,Now!
Marge,Dear God. We just killed a man.
Marge,Roger was telling the truth!
Marge,Soy sauce!
Marge,Low sodium!
Marge,We killed an innocent man. We're murderers! Murderers!
Marge,Why did you do that?
Marge,You're alive?
Marge,We'll know.
Marge,I can't live with the guilt.
Marge,Just sugarplums and buttercups.
Marge,Dinner is served. I tried to make what Homer said you liked.
Marge,Get them back -- she can't get neck-holes! It's picture day tomorrow!
Marge,"Yes, but they sold a bunch off to that frozen yogurt chain."
Marge,"Oh Homie, maybe we should call it a day."
Marge,I know where we are! This is the neighborhood where I grew up!
Marge,"Ooo, everything's changed! That tree used to be a smaller tree. And that food bank used to be a regular bank."
Marge,There's my old house!
Marge,We're not here for rabbit. I used to live in this house as a girl.
Marge,"Oh, I'd love to, if it's not an imposition."
Marge,Everything's just the way I remember it...
Marge,You see that mirror? I discovered that if I sat in the kitchen I could see if the bathroom was free using the reflection from the mirror off the toaster.
Marge,This was my bedroom! My bedpost smooshes are still in the carpet!
Marge,There are no books in the car.
Marge,My memorables!
Marge,My whole childhood is in this box! My scrunchies! I never really had the hair for these.
Marge,"Oh, that's ancient history. Ooh, here's my paper on ancient history."
Marge,You kids play nice up there!
Marge,"But it's not good enough, is it?"
Marge,That's odd. Lisa just threw her saxophone out the window.
Marge,She doesn't want to end up like me?!
Marge,What's so wrong with me?
Marge,I remember everything.
Marge,No. Just a picture of Lisa. Who wants to be nothing like me.
Marge,Stupid pan.
Marge,"Uh-huh, yeah. Here's your breakfast."
Marge,Not a good time!
Marge,Would it be so bad to turn out like me?
Marge,"We'd love to send you here, sweetie. We just can't afford it."
Marge,"Homer, Lisa, could you please step outside? I have a few choice words for this gentleman."
Marge,You what?!
Marge,Awww.
Marge,"What's wrong, sweetie -- you seem upset."
Marge,Is it Milhouse?
Marge,Are you sure? He's having a growth spurt.
Marge,Is it a girl?
Marge,"Hm, I never figured him for the bully type."
Marge,"Well, if he's got you cornered, and Milhouse isn't there to help you, there's only one way out: make him feel good about himself."
Marge,"I don't know, compliment his glasses."
Marge,There we go. Clean... and white... and soft.
Marge,"Lisa, honey, I insist. Because it's important to you that you don't turn out like me."
Marge,Why not?
Marge,What business?
Marge,I'm so glad you two are friends again.
Marge,Homer? How did you get...?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Stop burning!
Marge,They have a vaccine!
Marge,"Homer, did you know he was in the pile?"
Marge,This isn't the line for a movie. Why are you wearing that costume?
Marge,"Bart, who are you talking to?"
Marge,What's all that noise?
Marge,"Hm... Well, okay."
Marge,"I hope they use that spit for a good cause, like sealing wedding envelopes."
Marge,Thank God Mr. Burns isn't alive to see this.
Marge,"Just because Mr. Burns was mean to you, that doesn't give you the right to abuse him when he's helpless."
Marge,It's not up to you. We're going to take him to our moral and civic leaders. They'll know the right thing to do.
Marge,"Mr. Burns, you can't hurt us after all we've done for you."
Marge,You were given six weeks to live. And you've outlived it! I think what kept you alive was that for once in your life you were helping other people.
Marge,"Homer, are you scaring those kids?"
Marge,Opossum!
Marge,"Sweetie, everyone has an animal they can't stand. Indiana Jones had snakes, the Grizzly man had grizzlies, and... you know, I'm not crazy about opossums."
Marge,Those creepy little claws...
Marge,Who's a possum? You're a possum.
Marge,What's that?
Marge,You Brickyard Bimbo!
Marge,We know. And we're going to do something about it.
Marge,How can you say a thing like that?
Marge,No he doesn't!
Marge,"Homie, why don't you study these?"
Marge,I bought it because Catherine Zeta Jones told me to. What a fool I was.
Marge,Are you sure?
Marge,We're bringing the dog because we've found him a new home at a farm upstate where he can run and play all day.
Marge,"No! For once, a pet ""going to a farm upstate"" really is going to a farm upstate."
Marge,"Well, ""ditching"" is a harsh word."
Marge,It wasn't really a lot of chitchat.
Marge,"Bart, sweetie... would you like to say goodbye?"
Marge,"So, Lisa. Do you want an ostrich feather centerpiece?"
Marge,Well we've gotta buy something!
Marge,"More Oxycontin Candy, sweetie?"
Marge,"Wrong holiday, stupid!"
Marge,I could use some help!
Marge,"Lisa, what are you doing?"
Marge,Next you'll have a problem with my gingerbread house.
Marge,At least someone around here's got the Christmas spirit.
Marge,What?
Marge,But you wanted those toys.
Marge,Even Mac Davis himself couldn't save this Christmas.
Marge,I'm trying! It just keeps popping off.
Marge,"You can make it through this, Marge. Just think of Homer."
Marge,"This tree reminds me of your father. It's round in the middle, thinning on top, and your hands get sticky when you touch it."
Marge,Right before Christmas?
Marge,But I...
Marge,Auf Wiedersehen.
Marge,I've always believed in you even when others didn't. Can you help save our family Christmas? Marge Simpson.
Marge,Martha Stewart! How did you get in here?!
Marge,But I was gonna-- Oooh!
Marge,"So, this stuff will just shampoo out, huh?"
Marge,He's starting to wake up.
Marge,"Martha, the house looks beautiful -- it's like Christmas with a childless gay couple. But it's just not the same without my family being themselves."
Marge,You have a magic wand?
Marge,I guess I'll never have a perfect Christmas.
Marge,"What's wrong, Homie?"
Marge,Everyone shush!
Marge,I didn't. I got secondhand wasted from smooching your father. So not a peep out of anyone till the Fiesta Bowl!
Marge,I know when the freakin' Fiesta Bowl is!
Marge,"Dear Lord, watch over my sweet Homie while he's in the hoosegow."
Marge,What's going on? I called the prison and they won't tell me where Homer is!
Marge,"Homie, I know you had a terrible experience, but it's over."
Marge,You never took me to that bar on the beach.
Marge,Sounds pretty good.
Marge,Why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?
Marge,I was afraid this day would come.
Marge,"When it's closed it's a chair! When you were little, I used to take you to a Mommy-and-Me toddler gym."
Marge,You were friends with three other boys and I became close with their moms.
Marge,But they were a bad influence on you.
Marge,"The Moms and I had a falling out, which was a shame. We had been such good friends."
Marge,"We called ourselves ""the Cool Moms."""
Marge,Maybe we could get back together...
Marge,You can't buy white wine!
Marge,It's all yours.
Marge,"Seven years. A lot of memories. Talking, chatting..."
Marge,"I'm glad you had fun, because we're all getting together next week."
Marge,"Huh? Oh, myself, I guess."
Marge,Who's kicking?
Marge,"Sorry, I'm just not used to everyone behaving."
Marge,"Go out on a Tuesday? Who am I, Charlie Sheen?"
Marge,"Fine, I'll do it!"
Marge,Thanks for the ride!
Marge,Shh!!!
Marge,Just a little Merloooot.
Marge,You wanna stay up and talk a while? I'm not sleepy.
Marge,"And Anita's family rented a beach house, and guess what? They went to the beach every day!"
Marge,But I don't want a beach house. Sand makes me sad. Because it used to be big rocks. But not anymore. Not anymore...
Marge,What are you boys doing?
Marge,"Milhouse, I'm getting tired of waiting."
Marge,"Yes, you may."
Marge,"Bart, sweetie..."
Marge,"I love you kids with all my heart, but dammit, I need something for myself!"
Marge,"It's close, but no."
Marge,So Bart... the little dickens... was gonna set off an explosion to break us up. Can you believe it?
Marge,What are you talking about?
Marge,You know nothing about my son and even less about apples.
Marge,"I remember why I left this group seven years ago, and it's why I'm leaving now! Good day, ladies."
Marge,I think they were never my friends... Maybe true friends aren't random people you meet at a Mommy and Me class. They're random people you meet in a college dorm.
Marge,Awww...
Marge,"Well... Homer got along so well with the other dads, I couldn't break it to him."
Marge,"You know, this is the first time I've ever been at Moe's without that little voice in the back of my head saying ""this is not a safe place to drink."""
Marge,"What do you mean, wig?"
Marge,"Moe, do these guys think you're one of them?"
Marge,Now it's ready for garbage!
Marge,"What's wrong, Homie?"
Marge,There's nothing sexier than a man being a good Dad. Whoa!
Marge,Just hope the kids didn't hear us.
Marge,"Homer, you can't order anything from that magazine. It's twenty-five years old."
Marge,Um... well... of course you did!
Marge,"Hey, they're your gutters too."
Marge,I've got summer squash!
Marge,"Well, maybe you shouldn't listen to a thirty-year-old TV show that only got on the air because the network had evidence that the president ran over a guy."
Marge,Homer! We only have five minutes until the school bus comes.
Marge,My first gray hair!
Marge,"Homie, you always mean to say the nicest things."
Marge,"Very romantic. Homer had the basketball game muted the whole time. Oh, and then I found a gray hair. No big deal."
Marge,Really?
Marge,She doesn't seem so worried about her gray hair.
Marge,I brought home fried chicken...
Marge,And a completely new hairstyle!
Marge,A completely new hairstyle!
Marge,"So, what do you think?"
Marge,"Well, what do you kids think of the real me?"
Marge,"What do you think, Homie?"
Marge,"Need some coolin' down, Hot Stuff?"
Marge,There's a woman who's got it all under control.
Marge,"Well, thank you."
Marge,Neither did I. I didn't want to know what color the Statue of Liberty was. But you know what? I was wrong. And these ladies are too.
Marge,What kind of card?
Marge,The A.A.? No!
Marge,"A.A.A.? No, I'm not in triple-A. I don't like their ""Westways"" magazine. They'll give four diamonds to any place that's got a lid on the toilet."
Marge,P?! The A.A.R.P.?! Well that tears it. I don't want this milk and I'm not gonna take it back.
Marge,"I thought you'd be more supportive. I mean, you went gray yourselves."
Marge,"He loves it! He calls me his ""silver belle!"""
Marge,Why are you always trying to cause trouble with me and Homer? Our marriage is rock solid!
Marge,"Sorry, but I'm fighting for my man!"
Marge,Give me a double espresso to go.
Marge,"Look out, chicks! The silver fox is coming to the hen house!"
Marge,"I'm okay, I'm okay."
Marge,Brambles!
Marge,Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
Marge,I'm looking for Homer Simpson.
Marge,"Odd, that's what the valet just asked me."
Marge,Get your hands off my husband!
Marge,True beauty isn't about hair color?
Marge,"But be honest, when I say ""beautiful woman,"" what pops into your head?"
Marge,But you said going from blue to gray was empowering.
Marge,Oh.
Marge,"Oh hello, young man! Where's your father?"
Marge,"Bart's been alone for twenty-three minutes! Let's get this yo on the road, people!"
Marge,You ate his yogurt in the car.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Don't worry, sweetie, this is just the first of way too many awards shows. You'll get your chance to say ridiculous things."
Marge,"Thanks, Rollin' Eighties."
Marge,"Okay, we're gonna take turns having Grampa as a roommate. Who wants to go first?"
Marge,"Homer, I told you he wouldn't sleep through it."
Marge,Go! Save yourselves!
Marge,Abe? Are you feeling all right?
Marge,At some point I think we should see a doctor.
Marge,At least no one else has taken this drug.
Marge,"Bart, why are you tugging on your collar?"
Marge,"Walther, when a man puts something on a Frisbee, he should stand by it."
Marge,See?
Marge,What are you guys doing up there?
Marge,"Homie, you know all the bits. Maybe you could help him!"
Marge,"Homer Simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. Help him!"
Marge,"And remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. Save lust and rage for me and the kids."
Marge,Awww.
Marge,Time to finally return your father's overdue movies.
Marge,Got a better idea?
Marge,"Um, hello... I'm Marge Simpson... I think I've given you money a of couple times..."
Marge,"No, no, no, no, no, no -- I don't want the money back, I just came for my dog."
Marge,I hate to say this about the Cat Lady... but I think she's crazy. She's a hoarder!
Marge,We can. It'll be great. Like a reality show without the cameras.
Marge,"Now, we've managed to preoccupy the cat lady for the next few hours."
Marge,"Haul away, driver man!"
Marge,Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Marge,A perfectly-good hot lather dispenser. I can't count the number of times Homie's cried in anguish over his lukewarm lather.
Marge,"Ooh, a pen from the Milwaukee Hilton! ...a phone answering machine from the '80s!"
Marge,"All of J.D. Salinger's books, except ""Catcher In The Rye!"" Used pizza protectors!"
Marge,/ Ooo!
Marge,I can't believe the crazy house would throw out all these forks.
Marge,What are you talking about?
Marge,I'm not a hoarder! Do the Yankees hoard pennants? Does Marrakesh hoard intrigue?
Marge,But...
Marge,"It's so fancy -- sushi bars, a sixty-screen movie theater, museum of tolerance..."
Marge,They even have a day spa staffed by former all-pro linemen.
Marge,"Ooo, they even have a zoo -- featuring all the NFL mascots!"
Marge,This place even has its own arts district! With football-hating intellectuals!
Marge,"Homer, the game is right here!"
Marge,"Ooh, the ""Fan Cam!"""
Marge,"Homie, maybe you should stop. We've talked about the gray zone..."
Marge,"Homer! Just because everyone else is doing the wave, doesn't mean you have to!"
Marge,And I wouldn't blame him. You destroyed our son's self-esteem.
Marge,I told you you should've stopped the tickling.
Marge,What?
Marge,You can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.
Marge,That's great. Then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
Marge,There's one right here!
Marge,"You'll be fine, you always are."
Marge,Homer! Homer!
Marge,The school called and said Bart is out of control. I think we may need some therapy for him.
Marge,Dr. Zander? Kareem Abdul Jabbar? Anyone?
Marge,"Dr. Zander, what happened?"
Marge,Those are pieces of broken glass.
Marge,"Look, now my son needs your help."
Marge,Uh... Twenty-three dollars... and there's a can of beans in my car.
Marge,"So whatever you did to my husband, it was too effective!"
Marge,And now my son is a bully. Can you fix him?
Marge,"While your father and brother are doing some manly bonding in the woods, I thought we could do a little bonding of our own."
Marge,"We'll do each other's nails, make some brownie sundaes, and watch the four saddest horse movies I could find."
Marge,"""Broken-Leg Beauty,"" ""Sorry, Silver,"" ""No More Mint Juleps..."" And the fourth one has a title so sad I can't even say it."
Marge,"Oh, I always forget about this part."
Marge,"Actually, we pay them for each peach we take home."
Marge,"Okay, we've got peach bruschetta on peach toast, peach-aroni peach-za, and my famous B.L.T.s -- or should I say P.P.P.s?"
Marge,"C'mon, people. Peaches!"
Marge,"Ooh, couples! That way I can enjoy my massage, and make sure you don't enjoy yours too much."
Marge,What?! What? What will we eat?
Marge,Oh screw it.
Marge,"So, that's why Lisa excused herself a few minutes ago."
Marge,"Selma, I just can't get over the new you."
Marge,"I'm sorry, Fat Tony. My husband doesn't realize what he's saying, then, five seconds later:"
Marge,No!
Marge,Excuse me. We can't find our seats. Marge and Homer Simpson.
Marge,"Hm, there must be some mistake."
Marge,I'm her sister. And you?
Marge,Why did you seat us in Siberia?
Marge,"He's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result."
Marge,I was never sure about this marriage.
Marge,We're throwing the brunch!
Marge,I still can't believe it. I have never been so snubbed at one of Selma's weddings.
Marge,I don't think this is a good idea at all. The only husband of Selma's I liked was Disco Stu. He was so upbeat till he found out she didn't care for disco.
Marge,I will!
Marge,Can you read by it?
Marge,"These people are always grinding against each other, and I think they're all related. I wish we'd never come."
Marge,You've never supported mine!
Marge,"Well, you married someone whose first name is ""Fat""!"
Marge,Which is our room again...
Marge,"Oh, my poor Homie."
Marge,That was a mirror!
Marge,"Goomar?! That's mob talk for ""mistress."" Fat Tony has a mistress!"
Marge,"Well, Homer and I are going to take you away right now."
Marge,"Sorry, The Occurrence, but to use your lingo, Homer and I have to be ""that guy."""
Marge,Enough!
Marge,This doesn't make any sense. There was a wedding. You exchanged vows.
Marge,"In a good marriage, you never say I told you so."
Marge,"Homer, thanks to your unlicensed barbery, Patty and Selma have been getting compliments all day at the DMV."
Marge,One hundred.
Marge,"I'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. But I never knew you were so good with hair."
Marge,"Well... Newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors."
Marge,"Homie, are you even listening to me?"
Marge,Because I have so much to tell you: the mailman did the other side of the street before our side. Turns out it was a substitute.
Marge,This ends now!
Marge,You can start with the rinse!
Marge,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Julio is my little secret! I've said too much!"
Marge,"Homie, you're making my toes curl. You sure know how to please a woman."
Marge,What's wrong?
Marge,Maggie!
Marge,We've gotta get her out of there! Babies aren't supposed to sleep on their stomach on a cake!
Marge,"Okay. Okay, the spare key is somewhere in here."
Marge,We got out of it just in time.
Marge,At some point we should try to return these keys to their rightful owners.
Marge,"Homer, stop him!"
Marge,"Excuse me, has anyone seen my toy?"
Marge,...And these are from sardine cans your father opened. He saved them out of sentimental value.
Marge,"Well, Maggie, one key left for us!"
Marge,This looks like it's from a wind-up toy.
Marge,I hope we haven't stumbled onto my anniversary present.
Marge,Homer? Could you please turn down those blimp engines and tell me where you are?
Marge,"I'll call you back! Come back, Pooter Toot! People might be offended by your mild tastelessness!"
Marge,Uh-oh.
Marge,That wisenheimer windup toy could be anywhere.
Marge,Chief Wiggum! Stop that train!
Marge,"Oh, I'm sorry, Homie."
Marge,No! You should never raise your hand to a child. Just leave the crust on their sandwiches. They'll get the message.
Marge,"Actually, sometimes you do push Ned around."
Marge,"Don't do that, Homie. It rubs off your side hair."
Marge,"I hope you're proud of yourself, Homer."
Marge,"Well, there's Ned out on his power walk. Maybe you should talk to him."
Marge,That was a traffic signal.
Marge,He's a good man and a good neighbor and you're drinking coffee from his mug right now.
Marge,So we're going to let the internet decide. Should Ned and Edna stay together? Visit thesimpsons.com and vote.
Marge,We'll announce the results in next year's season premiere. Probably at the end so you'll watch the whole thing.
Marge,Homer! Stop teasing!
Marge,"Homie, it was Maggie."
Marge,Just vote! It's your duty as a citizen of TV.
Marge,Thank you! This is my third favorite reality cooking show!
Marge,"Kids, enjoy your extreme snack!"
Marge,I put a slice of apple in it!
Marge,Did you have a hard day too?
Marge,"It's big to you. Would you like a ""get well"" pork chop?"
Marge,"Well, if anyone saves my Homie's life, they get a free meal. Which actually comes up about once a week."
Marge,"Well, what brought you to Springfield? Was it our Frito Lay distribution center?"
Marge,"And when there was a map-maker's convention here, they all got Lou Gehrig's disease."
Marge,"Kids, can I talk to Wayne alone a minute?"
Marge,I don't know if you should teach our children advanced interrogation techniques.
Marge,Apology accepted. Now could you teach me a couple little driving tricks?
Marge,We'll see who gets their pick of pizza pockets!
Marge,How are you going to find him?
Marge,How did that happen?
Marge,How about living on a train that's always moving?
Marge,Wait! I know a place you can go! A place where a sadistic man with government experience can feel right at home.
Marge,"Wow -- the gym ropes are seaweed, the basketball nets are fishing nets..."
Marge,Ooh! We can wear those to the nice mall!
Marge,"That's great, Homie! Come have some ice cream on a brownie!"
Marge,Come in and get some more!
Marge,He's not a bad boy.
Marge,He had a teacher who finally got through to him and they fired him.
Marge,Homie... you're paralyzed. But we love you and will never give up hope.
Marge,"Okay handsome, that's enough primping!"
Marge,Just because you've had a little setback doesn't mean you can't look your best.
Marge,"Oh, Homie..."
Marge,Shhh. Don't say a word.
Marge,Wanna go home and celebrate?
Marge,"Homer, have you noticed how many of your enemies have died lately? Mr. Burns, Sideshow Bob..."
Marge,"Patty and Selma?! Who's next, Ned Flanders?"
Marge,What happened?!
Marge,But you're God. Couldn't you make everything the way it was?
Marge,Knitting one sweater for someone costs twenty-seven Americans their jobs.
Marge,Don't touch the scab!
Marge,They're all pretty big...
Marge,This is the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my entire life!
Marge,Take off the 3-D glasses!
Marge,"Aren't you gonna come to bed, Homie?"
Marge,I know! I know!
Marge,"... And here's a marble for Lisa for cleaning her room, and a marble for Bart for not trashing Lisa's room."
Marge,The jars are full -- so you've earned your... Saturday Surprise Dad Day!
Marge,You kids have had a big day. Head up to the tub while I deflate your toys.
Marge,The kids sure had a good time with you.
Marge,"How come they never call me ""Fun Mom?"""
Marge,"It's not fair. Moms want to be fun, but we're stuck with all the... mom stuff."
Marge,What if... We roll pennies and go to the dollar store!
Marge,I've got it!
Marge,Your Saturday Surprise Mom Day is... the X-Games!
Marge,"Come on kids, fun comes from inside -- it isn't about what we actually do."
Marge,"You're right, you're right, you're right -- let's go."
Marge,"I'm sorry, gang. I blew it."
Marge,"Why do old squirrels always crawl into my engine to die? Guess we'll be making an unscheduled pit stop, gang."
Marge,Nowhere scary!
Marge,Everything's fine... we'll just wait here for the tow truck.
Marge,That newborn has earrings!
Marge,I guess we could make a sprint for one of these local establishments.
Marge,They're using pancakes as spoons!
Marge,"Ooo, let's see what else they do wrong!"
Marge,They're selling CDs in the restaurant.
Marge,Back to the car.
Marge,"Oh, I'll just have a side salad..."
Marge,Back to the car!
Marge,What's the craziest thing on the menu?
Marge,Then I'll have that!
Marge,"Okay Marge, you test drove a convertible once, you can do this."
Marge,Holy casserole-y! That's good gloop!
Marge,"Oh this, it's just a little Zelzel Minchet Aletcha Wat. It's all I ever eat here."
Marge,"So, did all of your cars break down?"
Marge,"""When you stick a pancake into a friend's mouth, it's a 'goorsha.'"" Everybody goorsha!"
Marge,"Relax, Homie. Have some leftover Galalalalalalalalah."
Marge,"""Three?"" You mean, one, two... me?"
Marge,"Uh, kids... don't forget about our special plans Saturday night."
Marge,"Don't be so jealous, Homie, just because the kids are finally having fun doing something with me."
Marge,Of what?
Marge,What are you doing?
Marge,"Homie, I don't want you to feel excluded. Would you like to come with us to dinner at El Chemistri?"
Marge,Of course.
Marge,Why?
Marge,"Ooo, triple spicy barbequed stingray stuffed with pig organs!"
Marge,But this was all I had!
Marge,Gordon Ramsay!
Marge,It's my dream!
Marge,"Kids, I was thinking... was it really such a great idea to invite your father to that dinner?"
Marge,But there weren't Four Musketeers...
Marge,D'Artagnan wasn't a musketeer! He only had a letter of introduction to the captain of the guards -- which he lost!
Marge,"Oh, I doubt it. You sit at communal tables, full of hipsters."
Marge,"And the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. It's too crazy for you."
Marge,"Yeah, you always do. Well, here's where to meet us..."
Marge,1501 W-- East Oak Street.
Marge,Uhh... Yes! Yes! East Oak Street. That's where you should go. See ya there!
Marge,Don't you judge me.
Marge,"Eh, save it for the sitter!"
Marge,Um... I don't know. Probably changed his mind and stopped off for donuts.
Marge,"Sure, your Dad's great, but I'm fun too -- look at me eat, huh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!"
Marge,Who am I kidding? I'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. I'm calling Homer.
Marge,"Foodies, help me! My husband's in danger!"
Marge,A wife needs to tell her husband she was wrong!
Marge,I've got to save him!
Marge,My dessert!
Marge,Eat deconstructed apple pie!
Marge,This is nice -- a family fun day!
Marge,It's so cute that all these children are excited to see their favorite dinosaurs!
Marge,"Ooo kids, did you hear that lesson?"
Marge,What? They've got a point.
Marge,"Oh honey, I'm sorry your book lady turned out to be a dinosaur. But you liked the stories when you read them, so what does it matter?"
Marge,"I know you're hurting, but that's no reason to lash out at me."
Marge,I hope Bart's having fun.
Marge,"Welcome home, handsome!"
Marge,To the victor go the spoils.
Marge,If you kissed her that would be lovely.
Marge,Hel-lo.
Marge,"Homie, what are you doing?"
Marge,You make electricity. It runs the hospital!
Marge,That's because it would kill you.
Marge,I'm your wife.
Marge,I'm going to bed.
Marge,"I'm sorry to bother you at home, Mr. Marlowe..."
Marge,...but my husband's acting pretty odd. Coming home late. Drinking in the morning.
Marge,I don't suppose you'd consider taking your old job back so Homie can go back to his old job?
Marge,"Well, you certainly won't be bending me-- Wait, how did I end up in your bedroom?"
Marge,"Look, I came to talk about my husband, and... How did we get in here?"
Marge,I'm a happily married woman!
Marge,I know! And I don't want him to stray from anything except his diet. And I don't really want him to do that.
Marge,See? Luckiest man in the world.
Marge,Luann?
Marge,"Homer, I want you to come with me and the kids on a family vacation."
Marge,The farthest thing from this office I know: rafting down Rattler River Canyon.
Marge,Don't talk to me like I'm a client!
Marge,And maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.
Marge,Homer! Are you... schmoozing those men?
Marge,"For God's sakes, Homer! I've given you three children!"
Marge,"Yours, Homie. I'm always on yours."
Marge,"Oh, I'm so glad you're not an Accounts Man anymore."
Marge,"Kids, that's enough TV. Maggie's eye is starting to wander."
Marge,"No more TV! We're gonna get some fresh air, and visit the Museum... of Television."
Marge,We have to see the Museum of TV before next Wednesday when it closes forever.
Marge,"Isn't that just a rip-off of ""The Honeymooners?"""
Marge,"Oh Ralph, Fred, Archie, King of Queens, I mean Homer."
Marge,"So, what was everyone's favorite moment at the museum?"
Marge,This is the part where I get the kids out of the room.
Marge,"Annie, would you ever consider taking Krusty back as a client?"
Marge,I hereby declare Thanksgiving dinner officially over!
Marge,"Which means, it's the start of Christmas season...which means..."
Marge,Yup!
Marge,We tried that last year!
Marge,You'll understand one day when you have kids of your own.
Marge,Just look happy!
Marge,"Why do you say ""future?"" This is now."
Marge,I just got a message from Maggie in my brain.
Marge,"She's coming home for Christmas! And Bart's bringing the boys! And Lisa's coming with Zia! For once, the whole family's going to be here for the holidays!"
Marge,"Don't open it, Homie! It's a virus!"
Marge,"Not since they passed ""Homer's Law."" Oh honey, why don't you just relax and bake something?"
Marge,"Sweetie, I've been waiting to hear you say that for so long. Although you could've waited till morning..."
Marge,Merry Christmas Eve! Where are the kids?
Marge,"People learn from their mistakes and your father made so many mistakes. And now, Patty and Selma are here to help us decorate with their new love-bots."
Marge,"Oh, it's so good to meet the octuplets' octuplets."
Marge,I just got a b-mail from Maggie -- she's gone into labor!
Marge,Lisa...
Marge,The contractions?
Marge,"Everyone, it's a girl!"
Marge,"Okay, everyone. Smile while the pets take our picture."
Marge,"Cousin Kathy invited us so our feelings wouldn't be hurt, and we're going so her feelings won't be hurt."
Marge,I told you not to pack them!
Marge,That's toothpaste!
Marge,That's toothpaste!
Marge,Now I have to change the nipple!
Marge,This is the last airline that would take us.
Marge,No one's shotgun! Now be quiet!
Marge,"Homie, you can win this argument! Just rant and rave like you do to the TV during sports!"
Marge,How can you refer to your audience that way?
Marge,"No, we're out."
Marge,"Homie, I'm glad you're passionate, I just hope you're not riling people up with your show."
Marge,"Speaking for Lisa and me, we're not really a hundred and ten percent behind you anymore."
Marge,"Homie, I love you, and I'm glad we're finally using our wedding china, but when you're helping to pick the next leader of the free world..."
Marge,My daughter's a vegetarian.
Marge,I listen to him.
Marge,"Homie, wake up."
Marge,"It wasn't just her, Homie. It was all of us."
Marge,No strangling on school days!
Marge,"Bart, it's okay to say that at home, but not in court! Take it back!"
Marge,"Now, Lisa tell your side of the story. And use your big voice."
Marge,Homie! Stop watching the movie in the other people's car!
Marge,You'll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall!
Marge,Someone thinks we're leaving. I'll wave them off.
Marge,Homie...
Marge,"Ooo, condos!"
Marge,"Lenny, do you live here?"
Marge,"Actually, we just came to do some shopping... as a family."
Marge,I was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. Better sort those out.
Marge,Enough!
Marge,"I think it just froze. Oh no. No, that bird just moved."
Marge,"Uh oh, a draggy backpack."
Marge,"Well, it's not just kids using SpringFace -- it's moms like me. Marge!"
Marge,"Yeah, look!"
Marge,Homer! Watch the road!
Marge,Rag soup!
Marge,Come on in!
Marge,"Well, during the town meeting, which now seems like years ago, I forgot my purse at your bar...and when I came back to get it, I saw how much you love that rag."
Marge,"It seemed a little... ""ripe"", so I brought it home to clean it for you."
Marge,"Well, that's not true! Everyone in this family is your friend."
Marge,It's a beautiful afternoon. No TV.
Marge,No TV on the computer!
Marge,No TV on a smart phone!
Marge,"Homie, read this."
Marge,"""My darling husband. This Valentine's Day, I have a present for you..."""
Marge,My pleasure.
Marge,"...I want you to have a fun night doing guy stuff. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine."
Marge,I just think we should do things every day to show our love for each other.
Marge,"It's okay, Homie. Go. Have a good time. Take Bart with you!"
Marge,"Lisa, I love spending mother-daughter time with you. We have so much in common, like... um... Oh no! Someone's about to put the thousand island ladle into the vinaigrette!"
Marge,Don't panic. This can be separated out. Quick! Does anyone have a centrifuge?!
Marge,Lisa?
Marge,"Well. I usually take Lisa, but I can just go with Bart."
Marge,"Well, if you'd been here for the design phase, you could've registered that objection. Now start quilting!"
Marge,Now there's three of you?
Marge,"""She had now come to the part that Peter Pan hated. 'I do like a mother's love,' said Tootles..."""
Marge,Is it on your father? Little girls always get crushes on their fathers.
Marge,"Okay. Let's ""esque"" him to dinner."
Marge,This house is not an embarrassment!
Marge,"Usually when I say something like that, something extremely embarrassing happens. I'm gonna say goodnight before it does."
Marge,"Oh, my. I don't know if anyone's ever kissed my hand before."
Marge,I'll get a couple glasses.
Marge,"You're going with me! But Lisa, after this, I don't want you to spend any more time with this boy. If you do, it'll mean you're a separate person from me."
Marge,Lisa!
Marge,I feel kinda silly I walked all the way out here. You're just fine. You always are.
Marge,Now we're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours...
Marge,Homie! What if that was the last thing you ever said?
Marge,"All right, who's the wisenheimer that's been eating the powdered food?"
Marge,That's odd.
Marge,Why are all those cars parked at City Hall?
Marge,"Not without us, it isn't! Pull over."
Marge,What's going on? Why is there a picture of us? This isn't good.
Marge,"Moe, it's me, Marge! I'm your friend!"
Marge,Why would an entire town go to all this fuss to get rid of one family? What have we done that's so terrible?
Marge,Homer! That is not banishment-hearing behavior!
Marge,If I may speak.
Marge,We're not monsters. We're just people. People who love each other and love this town. The only place we've ever called home. Thank you.
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,That was the last Springfield radio station. Now we just get Shelbyville talk radio.
Marge,"Please sir, we've been thrown out of a place we've always called home. We just wanna live out our lives in peace."
Marge,I don't think this place is so great.
Marge,"I'm trying to make the best of things, but I'm worried Maggie is falling in with a bad crowd."
Marge,I miss our home and I want to go back.
Marge,Is it Iraqi journalists being murdered?
Marge,"He's no Ned Flanders. And I miss the Springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. God help me, I even miss Helen Lovejoy criticizing my brownies."
Marge,"Homie, these disguises won't fool anyone."
Marge,Look! A shooting star!
Marge,On a night like tonight I have to believe there are.
Marge,Wanna make out over the foul line?
Marge,"Don't even bother shooting us. We've found a new place that we love. A place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more..."
Marge,What are you doing here?
Marge,Stop! Stop! This is everything we put behind us!
Marge,Ooh! An apron with a sonnet!
Marge,A bunny! Just like the one I had when I was a girl! How did you know?
Marge,"Oh Bart, you got me the fluffy pet I've never stopped thinking about!"
Marge,"Now, last but not least, your present, Homie."
Marge,"Well, we're still focused on me instead of watching golf, so that's pretty good."
Marge,Please don't say one again.
Marge,"Homie, whatever it is, it's not happening."
Marge,"Well, at least you remembered I like her."
Marge,I think that's enough birthday fun.
Marge,"Homie, have you seen our stencil budget for this month?"
Marge,He won't leave the car.
Marge,I can see how this show might not be to his liking.
Marge,"Wait, wait, wait. He's just a boy! Do you have to put him in jail?"
Marge,Why? Are you going to do the laundry?
Marge,What's going on?
Marge,We're wetting the bed?
Marge,"I'm sorry, Homie. A diaper just isn't sexy."
Marge,He's a baby with wings!
Marge,That's just not doing it for me.
Marge,"Professor Frink, are you all right?"
Marge,It's kind of embarrassing...
Marge,How do you know about it?
Marge,...so we can go inside Homer's sleeping mind and find out why he's wetting the bed.
Marge,Why does Maggie have to go?
Marge,It's Death! I recognize him from fortieth-birthday cards!
Marge,"Homie, this might be a clue! What's in that coffin could be behind your nighttime oopsies!"
Marge,What do you see?
Marge,"Relax, everyone knows that if you die in a dream, you just wake up!"
Marge,At last we'll get to the bottom of...
Marge,Homie! We're here to find answers to your problem!
Marge,We know there's a marriage in trouble and it has something to do with fish...
Marge,"Mona, you're alive?!"
Marge,"That's Jennifer Aniston's hair on ""Friends."""
Marge,"Case closed! Now, let's return our dream skis."
Marge,Uh-oh.
Marge,And maybe you'll stop overeating too!
Marge,"Spin the top. If it falls over, we're in reality. If it spins forever, we're still in a dream."
Marge,Sounds like a plan!
Marge,Is that hail coming down?
Marge,Your father must be sleeping on his side again.
Marge,Homie! You're home early!
Marge,"Well, we're having brunch with my sisters..."
Marge,And you and I were going to study the municipal voter's guide.
Marge,"Homie, what are you drinking?"
Marge,There's champagne in those!
Marge,No! Irish and Long Island!
Marge,Mike's Hard!
Marge,Rum cake!
Marge,Suzette!
Marge,It's no fun to live in a town with a ninety-nine percent unemployment rate.
Marge,Mr. Burns seemed like such a nice man the day he arrived.
Marge,Which he didn't.
Marge,Barney?
Marge,Do a lot of people pay?
Marge,"Bart, you haven't touched your mashed potatoes."
Marge,"Bart, no dinner means no dessert."
Marge,"He exercises so much, but he looks the same. I guess the weight will all come off at once some day in the future."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"You're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago? And when I wanted to watch it with you then, you said it was pretentious and repetitive!"
Marge,It means use the treadmill for running or take it back!
Marge,On the TV!
Marge,On the ground!
Marge,This is the stupidest fight ever!
Marge,I don't think so.
Marge,It means I'm mad!
Marge,"Why, if it isn't Jimbo, Dorf and Ernie."
Marge,"Bart's not home yet, but I'm always looking to encourage non-Milhouse play-dates. Stick around!"
Marge,Now you be careful with Bart's undies.
Marge,"Homer, for God sakes, I'm trying to put Maggie to sleep!"
Marge,"You wanna know what happens on your stupid show? Firstly, the ""mysterious island"" is fifteen miles from Long Beach. Also, Doorway Three led to Hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to Hell, and the entire Strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box!"
Marge,"Lisa, are you out there in your slippers? Come inside!"
Marge,"Homie, come in the bedroom."
Marge,"Care to join me in a private ""last episode party""?"
Marge,"I'm sorry, sweetie. Maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at ""Mr. Steak."""
Marge,Well of course they don't.
Marge,There is no Mrs. Steak. Who could stay married to such a man.
Marge,"Just try to enjoy your dinner, sweetie."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"No. We saw how much this cruise means to you, so we all sold something special. And we made just enough for an economy cabin!"
Marge,And I sold our good china.
Marge,"Yeah... actually, my mom stole it from a woman she cleaned for. It took her years to get the whole set."
Marge,We sold it to pay for a family cruise!
Marge,"Homer! This is bad for you, too!"
Marge,"No, honey. You just passed out when you saw the private bedroom in our triple upgrade!"
Marge,You'll never guess how many bath towels they gave us... enough!
Marge,Homie... we actually have the cabin all to ourselves.
Marge,Woo-woo-woo-woo!
Marge,"Any place is fun if you're there with ""Super Lips."""
Marge,Purple!
Marge,"Bart, we're too worried to enjoy each other's mouths."
Marge,"Last week that steward brought me extra shampoo... he called me ""lovely lady."""
Marge,"Bart, glad you're here. We're all gonna watch a movie together."
Marge,There is no virus! Bart faked the whole thing with a DVD! A direct-to-video DVD!
Marge,"Excuse me, Cruise Director Priddis. My son has something to tell you."
Marge,"I know my son did a terrible thing. But there's a chapel on this ship, and in that chapel there's a book, and it says, ""Judge not, lest ye--"
Marge,"Sorry sweetie, I just needed to get that out of my system."
Marge,Whoa. /
Marge,Stop saying what you call things! I'm trying to watch the movie!
Marge,"Homer! People are here to see the movie, not listen to you!"
Marge,"There was enough talking during the movie! This date night was even worse than the date night we saw ""Date Night."""
Marge,Just take me home.
Marge,Not in the mood.
Marge,"Got what, Homer?"
Marge,"Homer, I'm a single mother trying to raise a family here."
Marge,Just zip it!
Marge,I have to take Maggie for her checkup. And a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house.
Marge,Homie's been working so hard I thought I'd bring him a special lunch.
Marge,"Here, right?"
Marge,What?! I knew there was a reason he was leaving on time!
Marge,"Busy day at work? Did you get a lot of work done, workerman?"
Marge,Don't give me that load of--
Marge,Head injury?! Why didn't you tell me?
Marge,This car's so clean! I'm not getting flea bites on my ankles!
Marge,Why is he trying to kill you and why did she call you her love?
Marge,The guy from the movie?
Marge,"So, how many more weeks do you have off?"
Marge,"Also, the passion play isn't stupid, it's the greatest story ever told!"
Marge,Ned and Edna married?
Marge,"Congratulations, you two! We're so, so happy for you!"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Enough with the voting. Ned, Edna, why didn't you tell us?"
Marge,"Ned, Edna... we just want to apologize for the commotion in your room..."
Marge,"Well, we're here to offer to throw you a little party in your honor."
Marge,This is my third favorite wedding supply store!
Marge,It's extreme enough for me when they smear the wedding cake on each other's faces.
Marge,"Well, you're all invited, so you can make your snippy comments while you eat my hors d'oeuvres."
Marge,Thank you! Everyone's having a great time.
Marge,"Helen, have a canapé! There's enough for everyone, but not too much."
Marge,No weird hookups!
Marge,"So, how do the boys like Springfield Elementary?"
Marge,Time for cake! Let's finish this sucker up.
Marge,Why does that make him right?
Marge,No video... party over... caaaake!
Marge,"Ned, how did you sleep?"
Marge,"Here's your lunches. With some cake. You'll be having cake for a long, long, time."
Marge,"Bart, is there something you want to tell us?"
Marge,That is totally irresponsible parenting!
Marge,Where on the internet?
Marge,Why would you believe him?
Marge,"Ned, I realized long ago, there are some things Homer and I will never completely agree on."
Marge,It's angry.
Marge,It's about not agreeing on something.
Marge,"Bart, just tell us the problem!"
Marge,"...and that's how Berber carpet got its name, according to some. Lisa, how was your day?"
Marge,"Whoever this ""Truth Teller"" is, I'm a fan. It takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously."
Marge,"Now sweetie, don't make a big deal out of this. I stopped reading after ""TOP STUDENT""."
Marge,I'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.
Marge,I never have any idea what to do for Lisa. To be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument I don't really care for. It's so hard.
Marge,"I wish I was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry, 'cause it doesn't work for me."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Lisa snuck out.
Marge,What are you gonna say?
Marge,"Homer, we can buy scotch tape tomorrow!"
Marge,"All right, who took the microwave?"
Marge,"Bart, that's sweet, but we'd need airplane money, hotel money..."
Marge,"Homer, that sounds like ""The Sweet Smell of Success""."
Marge,"So, this is basically what we can afford."
Marge,"Oh, forget it."
Marge,Just once I'd like your father to be on a JumboTron for something good.
Marge,"No, Lisa! If you click that turnstile, it'll blow our budget!"
Marge,La-dies-and-gen-tle-men-I-have-an-an-nounce-ment. That's not iambic pentameter!
Marge,"Our search for culture is thus concluded / For the bard of Avon is well-suited / To a crowd with ev'ry cell phone muted / Jeez, I can't stop talking like this."
Marge,"Well at least it didn't end as bad as ""Romeo and Juliet."""
Marge,"No! For details, log onto thesimpsons.com."
Marge,"Okay, that's it! I'm putting a baby-gate across the black hole, and don't throw anything more into it! Uh-oh, yes, Homer."
Marge,"I know we shouldn't feed this, but grease brings raccoons."
Marge,Quit bageling my English muffins!
Marge,Now what?
Marge,Wonderful stuff! Enjoy it!
Marge,Not with the camera on.
Marge,Looks like the red light's on.
Marge,"I don't know, I don't know! I'm sure I don't know!"
Marge,"Come here, you. /"
Marge,Give back my baby!
Marge,I brought this on us all. It began when I was a girl...
Marge,It was not love at first sight!
Marge,"Here's your smoothie, sweetheart."
Marge,"I'll tell you what I'm doing, I'm realizing that I married the wrong man. Oh, you poor, sweet, simple Homers."
Marge,I was supposed to be with all of you.
Marge,"Even you, Caveman Homer."
Marge,"Well, cardinal or cannibal, I wish that twenty years ago I had chosen love."
Marge,Lemme get this straight. None of you had time to take out the garbage?
Marge,Hummingbirds! Hum and get it!
Marge,"Homie, the faucet is dripping."
Marge,"Homer, when are you going to fix this faucet?"
Marge,Are you going to fix the faucet or not?
Marge,"""I'll get to it, Marge..."" ""I'll get to it..."" When we first got married, he'd only take six months to do things..."
Marge,Everyone relax. I think I've got an emergency sinkhole kit in here somewhere.
Marge,No one stays in the sinkhole!
Marge,But my car is down there!
Marge,"No, I'm here to buy one myself."
Marge,This car looks a little small. Is the engine powerful?
Marge,"Well, that's odd, because the consumer website says the RX-12 2-cylinder has a dealer's invoice of fourteen seven."
Marge,This says you are the manager.
Marge,It says on your Facebook page you have no kids.
Marge,Uh-oh! Do you hear that rattle?
Marge,And what's that smell?
Marge,Well I don't like it.
Marge,I still smell it!
Marge,Darn car won't start.
Marge,"Hmm. Well, it wouldn't start for me. I think this car's a lemon!"
Marge,"...the wipers wipe backwards, and the defroster lines on the back window are too close together! Excuse me."
Marge,What are you talking about?
Marge,"All right, I remember we all got in... and by the way, that backseat is pretty tight for the kids. I mean, I don't know what we'd do if we had another baby. With this car, we're basically saying no more babies!"
Marge,"Homer, the reason I hate this car is... I think I want another baby!"
Marge,I do!
Marge,"Homie, I want another baby."
Marge,"Maggie's not a baby! Her soft spot's been skulled over for the last three months! Being a mom is who I am, and I'm not done being who I am."
Marge,"Well, take a shower, 'cause we're gonna try it tonight!"
Marge,"Homer, why do you take a three second pause before you answer what I say?"
Marge,What a wonderful thought.
Marge,My husband and I have been snuggling six ways from Sunday...
Marge,"...but we aren't making a baby. I thought we should check, to make sure Homer has... you know, working stunt-men in his cannon."
Marge,What do you mean?
Marge,"I guess... that's that, then."
Marge,I can't believe we're never going to have another child...
Marge,"No, s'okay. We can share this with you... Homer can't make a baby because he nuked his swimmers."
Marge,You never told me about that.
Marge,Awww... Eww... Homie! We still have a chance!
Marge,Now I'm thinking Alex if it's a girl and Xander if it's a boy.
Marge,Okay.
Marge,"Ooh, a Christmas ornament museum! Can we stop?"
Marge,I think that Shiva used to be Paul Bunyan.
Marge,I can't believe we spent the whole day here.
Marge,"Well, maybe we should check into a motel."
Marge,"Ooh, Homie, you've lost weight."
Marge,It sure was nice to have a day together as a couple.
Marge,I thought the whole point of this trip was to have another baby.
Marge,"So, you don't want another baby? How long have you felt this way?"
Marge,Just yell across the house like you do everything else!
Marge,We're not talking!
Marge,You were pocket-dialed!
Marge,Shush!
Marge,"Homer... Homer, this is the point where I really have to know what you want."
Marge,Homer? How many samples did you sell?
Marge,I thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip.
Marge,"Homie, maybe we should wait."
Marge,Maybe there's enough Homer in the world for now.
Marge,"You know, I always send the theater manager a check the next day."
Marge,Another way is don't drink.
Marge,Homie! Do you know what yesterday was?
Marge,Yesterday's the day we were supposed to visit Grampa!
Marge,I still feel guilty. Your father's not going to be around forever.
Marge,"Fine, he'll be around forever."
Marge,"There's gotta be a clue in here somewhere. Spats, sock garters, the world's hardest hard candy..."
Marge,Grampa's army footlocker! I bet the most important things in the world to him are in this box!
Marge,Spiro's...
Marge,The place that changed my life?
Marge,Got it. Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
Marge,There's exactly one Rita Lafleur living in Springfield!
Marge,Hello? Rita Lafleur? Did you know a man named Abe Simpson?
Marge,"Homer, she's married to your Dad!"
Marge,You never looked up to him.
Marge,"Well, we certainly don't want to cause you any more pain."
Marge,That kind of romance leads to children.
Marge,"So, this was after Homer's mother left?"
Marge,But I thought you still loved him.
Marge,What does that mean?
Marge,"Abe, we were so worried."
Marge,"Grampa, we will never miss a visit again. And there'll be a lot more of them."
Marge,Don't take Grampa's meds!
Marge,Sh! Here comes Lisa's solo!
Marge,Lisa!
Marge,Please say it's the vegetarianism!
Marge,"Lisa, dinnertime!"
Marge,Lisa... would you like some shrimp?
Marge,"Homer, pay attention!"
Marge,Homer! The roof is leaking!
Marge,"Water's coming in the house, and we've got carpet mushrooms!"
Marge,"While you were out there daydreaming, this rain has ruined the house."
Marge,You're coming with us to the school fundraiser.
Marge,The only thing we know is it'll cost eight hundred dollars.
Marge,I don't care for silent auctions. It just encourages hovering.
Marge,That adult Etch-A-Sketch certainly has brightened your mood.
Marge,I always thought the Pringles Man had the kindest eyes.
Marge,Are you doing an app behind my back?
Marge,Put that down! We're being audited!
Marge,"Homie, you want to read to Maggie before she goes to sleep?"
Marge,Homie... it looks like you're putting all your eggs in one basket.
Marge,"Hm, I guess you're right. I guess I'll have to scratch that off the list of things I say."
Marge,Well... I like that its message is in sap and not in blood... like some miracles I could mention. Passover.
Marge,Homie? Aren't you going to come in?
Marge,"Don't call Satan! So what if the message wasn't a miracle? The answer isn't in syrup from God or a computer tablet, the answer is that the hope you felt was real."
Marge,"Homie, you have such a way with foods. Let's go inside."
Marge,No idea. The important thing is that they did.
Marge,"Relax, kids, just be yourselves."
Marge,"""Scientists Prove Cat Heaven Real, Human Heaven Not"" That's so sad..."
Marge,Oh... satire.
Marge,"And these fake movie reviews are so mean, it's hilarious."
Marge,Great paper.
Marge,Maggie's a little hungry.
Marge,That's not applesauce...
Marge,It sure is! There's nothing more natural than... that. It's just that Maggie's already... milked me today!
Marge,"Homer, I think we should go. We're not like these people."
Marge,You're all bald!
Marge,"Maybe we shouldn't rush things with the new neighbors. You know, we might not all be a perfect match."
Marge,But I always thought you were cool.
Marge,"Well sweetie, if it's that important to you, I guess we can try."
Marge,Ooo! Hygiene!
Marge,Your father took you to a Korean gangster film festival?
Marge,The kids are a mess! You brought them home exhausted and pretentious!
Marge,Parenting shouldn't have a style! Parenting is about bedtimes and passwords on computers and complicated punishments you never follow through on! Are you wearing a wallet chain?! You look like... a barista!
Marge,And what's with the scarf? It's soaked in neck sweat.
Marge,Made? Why didn't you just buy him a toy?
Marge,"Geez, is this a kid's birthday party or the place a bad guy kidnaps you to in a movie?"
Marge,There's gotta be a bounce house around here somewhere. At least maybe a piñata...?
Marge,Holy areole...
Marge,"I'd love to, but Maggie's a little shy..."
Marge,"Play along! Ooh, this couldn't feel more natural. Glug, glug, glug. That's a good little mammal."
Marge,"Fine! I admit it, you... nipple Nazis! I give my baby formula!"
Marge,Stay back! You know I'll use this... because you saw me using it.
Marge,"Also, I didn't want to tell you, but... that wife and her gang looked down on me because I don't breastfeed!"
Marge,"When you're old, your tattoos will be saggy and illegible!"
Marge,"See, see what I'm dealing with here, Ned? We invited them here, and they repay us with insults and judgments."
Marge,The cool people are everywhere! Somehow they've even made the weather rainier!
Marge,"C'mere, little buddy."
Marge,Stop your trendy arguing! I'm trying to call the fire department!
Marge,Then to save us... we need something incredibly unnatural!
Marge,Fifty gallons of baby formula will put out that blaze.
Marge,I guess I do feel a little bad about not breastfeeding my kids... except Lisa. I breastfed Lisa for nine months.
Marge,Milhouse?!
Marge,Hurry up! I want to get Grampa back here by three so we can get him and Maggie on the same nap schedule.
Marge,You know you can't lift your lifting belt without wearing your belt-lifting-belt!
Marge,Fine. Just stay here and hold down the fort.
Marge,Maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry.
Marge,Did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village?
Marge,"The animal shelter hasn't had any greyhounds turned in. Just a dachshund, a chow, and a pregnant raccoon."
Marge,We don't want a raccoon.
Marge,And he didn't pee on the floor!
Marge,Focus!
Marge,"Well, tell us your version."
Marge,Oh Homie. I'm so sorry.
Marge,Just hug already!
Marge,Homie?
Marge,"Homer, I told you, don't call me ""Mom."""
Marge,"This isn't the learn zone. Darn it, it's a fun place!"
Marge,Where do they go?
Marge,"Keep an eye on the kids, Homer."
Marge,Bart and Lisa.
Marge,"Calm down, everyone. Calm down. I'm sure they'll have us out of here soon."
Marge,"Until then, why don't we bond by sharing our child birth experiences."
Marge,See? All you need to get through a crisis is a little friendly conversation. Betcha the dads are doing the same thing!
Marge,You've been through a traumatic experience. Are you sure you wanna go to work today?
Marge,"I can't find all our cereal, crackers, juice boxes, the butter brush..."
Marge,What move? We haven't moved! What's going on?!
Marge,You can't have secrets from your wife!
Marge,I thought the basement looked cleaner.
Marge,Survive what?
Marge,It's reassuring to see you're aware of the future. But this is all a little... creepy.
Marge,I'm going to bed.
Marge,The end of the world as we know it?
Marge,"Lisa and Maggie are downstairs, and Bart's in his room with Milhouse."
Marge,"Homie, I never thought we'd turn our backs on our loved ones at the first hint of trouble."
Marge,No one was laughing. You kept it a secret!
Marge,How can you call yourself a Christian?
Marge,"Homer Simpson! When I fell in love with you, it was because of your big heart and your good looks. But some day those good looks are gonna fade."
Marge,"I'm proud of you. Society may have crumbled, but our decency hasn't."
Marge,Good boy.
Marge,"You're a good man, Homer Simpson."
Marge,Everything's normal. The world didn't end.
Marge,"Are you really so disappointed the world didn't end, just so you could be proven right?"
Marge,I'm afraid not.
Marge,And this goes too.
Marge,"Excuse me, you're that proctor that's shutting down my children's school."
Marge,"You've been in public education a long time, haven't you?"
Marge,"""Burly Paper Towels, Burlyville, Minnesota. Dear Sir or Madam: Your paper towel packets promised a hundred and two sheets of towels. But I was blessed to receive one hundred and three. I'm returning the extra towel, unused..."""
Marge,A pillowcase full of quarters?! Where did you get that money and what have you done with the pillows?!
Marge,"Well, we're gonna turn this change into change for the better!"
Marge,And I hope Bart passes his test and saves the school.
Marge,"I'm not sure if you gave my son any... extra help. But if you did, thank you."
Marge,"Would you... like to have coffee, or dinner, or just talk?"
Marge,"""In this exciting strategy game, you amass resources -- timber, salt fish, and wax -- to fund a syndicate to gain influence with the Doges of Venice."
Marge,We have to do something until the storm passes. Now just fill out these customs forms and we can get started.
Marge,"No, Homie! It's too dangerous!"
Marge,"What, 'cause they rented a van and taped an antenna to the top?"
Marge,"All right, but I'm coming with you to make sure no one does anything stupid."
Marge,I guess you do know your weather.
Marge,Aw.
Marge,"Homer, you do not have to compete with your friends for me."
Marge,Enough with the singing!
Marge,It's like God's vacuum cleaner!
Marge,And here comes Santa's Little Helper!
Marge,"Homie, we made it!"
Marge,Are you pushing?
Marge,I don't know if we're gonna be able to get out. What are you writing?
Marge,Hey! Hello!
Marge,Just cut the glass!
Marge,"Except for the face full of glass when the door finally collapsed, he did a pretty good job."
Marge,"Homie, if we did both die, we've never named guardians. The kids could end up wards of the state."
Marge,"No, our state."
Marge,There's really only one choice. Or should I say two identical choices?
Marge,"Homer, my sisters adopted Ling and she's doing great."
Marge,Maybe we'd better go.
Marge,"I think it's time to go ""off family."""
Marge,Uh oh. I wonder if word has gotten out that we're looking for guardians.
Marge,"Homer! Dual incomes, no kids at two o'clock!"
Marge,I think I hear a slight accent.
Marge,"That's where they filmed ""The Wire""! Step on it!"
Marge,"Maybe we should just give up for now, have some fried clams and collect sea glass."
Marge,That's Moe and a bag of garbage.
Marge,"So, surfing is really your job?"
Marge,Just for standing on a thing?
Marge,Homie... it's been a wonderful day... but do you think maybe we're moving a little too quickly?
Marge,But we know so little about them.
Marge,"Well, I must admit it's a relief to get that taken care of."
Marge,A whole weekend? I don't know...
Marge,I guess. As long as we don't make it a habit.
Marge,Do you have to do that in front of people?
Marge,"Well, at least we have time to get the pets' Christmas presents."
Marge,Oh God! They want to steal our kids!
Marge,It all makes sense now.
Marge,That's why they took our kids so quick.
Marge,She's gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure.
Marge,"Homie, I just had a horrible thought."
Marge,What if they are better for the kids than us?
Marge,"Look, before anyone says anything else, how could you possibly think you could get our kids?"
Marge,"Kids, your father and I have decided we're not in such a hurry to get you guardians."
Marge,"Homer, listen to the G.P.S."
Marge,"Turn right onto First Street, head east. Homer, watch the road! Not this road, the other road!"
Marge,"On Main Street, turn right now... / Our Sunday drive is ruined! Hands at ten and two!"
Marge,Homer Simpson! Did you take Maggie to Moe's?
Marge,I was the only one without a date at Patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening!
Marge,You should know that me saying I don't care means I couldn't care more.
Marge,"Bart, would you go to your room while your father and I finish our little talk?"
Marge,"All right. Fine. If you boys want it, I'll tell you what I really think."
Marge,"You're both in the doghouse, which is misleading 'cause I still like the dog."
Marge,Mmm! Cursive!
Marge,You are invited to... a grand gesture? Oooh!
Marge,A completed chore list!
Marge,Don't watch that DVD!
Marge,I threw that away because studies show it doesn't do any good!
Marge,Look at me!
Marge,"Maybe instead of watching TV with the kids, you could take them outside and... what are you doing?"
Marge,This so-called educational DVD may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it!
Marge,I'm afraid so.
Marge,While Bart turned out so wonderful in his own way!
Marge,I wish I knew what happened...
Marge,"And now that I know better, no DVDs for you kids. Just educational television."
Marge,"Okay, no TV at all."
Marge,"Fine, no TV for twenty-four hours."
Marge,"We can do without TV for a day! We're taking Maggie to a children's bookstore, where she can learn the old-fashioned way -- the way children did from nineteen-ten to two thousand and two."
Marge,"Homer, a little help?"
Marge,"Instead of watching TV, we can read children's books written by TV stars!"
Marge,"Look, Maggie! They have a story lady!"
Marge,Have you seen Lisa and Maggie?
Marge,"Homie, help me find them."
Marge,Mm-hmm!
Marge,I don't think so. The U.S. Embassy has warned people not to go to downtown Springfield.
Marge,Maybe we should go.
Marge,Now what are you doing?
Marge,"Homer, that's for children!"
Marge,Read the rest of the title!
Marge,"Oh, dang it!"
Marge,I lost my other earring.
Marge,Wondered where that was.
Marge,Can you find anything you like in this bed?
Marge,"Homer, Bart said the kids were going to the Van Houtens, but Luann just told me they're supposed to be here. They've disappeared!"
Marge,Do you think Lisa went to that jazz club I wouldn't take her to?
Marge,"Homie, do you see anything?"
Marge,The kids?
Marge,The top of your head has a five o'clock shadow.
Marge,He's ten years old!
Marge,I want to know what it's for.
Marge,We spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes?
Marge,I wasn't laughing -- I was being worried.
Marge,Makeup and baby oil!
Marge,It's not all lady stuff. Look at all these fitness publications.
Marge,I think your dad might be gay.
Marge,I think this is great! Old gay men are adorable! Like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar.
Marge,"Your dad's been in the closet for so long, he probably doesn't know how tolerant society's become. They even had a gay float in the Pride Parade last year."
Marge,"Oh Homie, you're so... enlightened."
Marge,"Oh honey, that's just silly! This'll show Helen Lovejoy, always bragging about her He-She cousin!"
Marge,Abe... we found your storage locker.
Marge,"If you don't want to die alone, come out of your room!"
Marge,Your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you. We've got to find him a boyfriend before it's too late!
Marge,Help me out of the closet! Wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death.
Marge,How about some fatties?
Marge,"Okay, post this under ""Men Seeking Men,"" but what sub-heading... nothing too serious... here we go -- ""Casual Encounters!"" Perfect, no pressure!"
Marge,I hope someone saw our ad.
Marge,Someone's coming!
Marge,"Don't you want to be happy, Abe? Admit who you are, a wonderful gay man!"
Marge,Is this true?
Marge,I so wanted him to be gay.
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,"Homer, do something! They're killing each other!"
Marge,"Your grandfather is not psycho! The only thing he's ""straight-up"" is loves you."
Marge,It's so sad that Grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his God-given wrestling skills. What kind of person revels in disapproval?!
Marge,Your behavior at that game was unacceptable! You're lucky they gave you your participant trophy.
Marge,"I know your Grampa seems exciting now... But all that preening and cheating, those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy."
Marge,"I don't care if Bart is a wrestler, a busboy, or even a stoplight squeegee man... as long as he's a nice person."
Marge,"But if he gets too much attention for acting bad, he might turn bad on the inside..."
Marge,"Oh, that was so sweet."
Marge,"I thought you might be cold, honey, so I put this chinchilla coat on you."
Marge,It's not chinchilla. I just thought she needed more sleep.
Marge,"Ned Flanders, I can't believe you struck my husband."
Marge,"Ned, Homie's a little cranky right now. More than his eye, I think you hurt his feelings."
Marge,My what?
Marge,I never made that noise in my life!
Marge,I wish you wouldn't wear sweaters that the senior ladies knit.
Marge,"What's the matter, sweetie? Is a book character having difficulties?"
Marge,Did you tell the teacher?
Marge,A teacher can't be a bully.
Marge,We're here because our daughter is being bullied by your teacher.
Marge,"Well, she's just a substitute. Maybe you could transfer Ms. Cantwell to another school."
Marge,"Homer, that's you."
Marge,Power.
Marge,Power.
Marge,They sure are getting along.
Marge,Objection! Unhealthy!
Marge,I volunteered to wash the egg stains off everyone's clothes. It's one of those things you say and hope nobody takes you up on it.
Marge,What's odd?
Marge,Splatter?
Marge,Interesting. Except you missed one thing.
Marge,It's not a skirt. It's a kilt!
Marge,"Why'd you do it, Willie?"
Marge,This is the coolest sushi restaurant in town! It got three-and-a-half stars in the Springfield Tire Guide!
Marge,"If they can be that rude, the food must be great!"
Marge,It's as yummy as your poorly-produced local commercial said.
Marge,So without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk.
Marge,"Uh, I'm thinking of getting Maggie swimming lessons."
Marge,"When God rested on the seventh day, did He take a nap or do a hobby He enjoyed?"
Marge,I think I'm interesting!
Marge,Can you chew with your mouth closed? It's like looking into a garbage disposal.
Marge,The most romantic part of this was the hold music when I made the reservation.
Marge,"That usually works, but not today."
Marge,Lousy.
Marge,I'm going to take a cab.
Marge,I'm not going to sleep!
Marge,In-ground?
Marge,Why are all his laundry basket shots three point attempts?
Marge,What are you doing home from work?
Marge,From the gas station?
Marge,"Well, that does sound good..."
Marge,I'll just stick this in your apology card drawer.
Marge,"No! I'm tired of your broken promises! ""Marge, I'm gonna lose ten pounds."" ""Sweetie, I'll be home at eight p.m."" ""Sweetie, I'll be home at eight a.m."" ""I'll take you out to the most romantic lunch of your life."" I'm done!"
Marge,"Homie, what are you doing?"
Marge,Homer...
Marge,This list is from six years ago.
Marge,How many times do I have to tell you to quit comparing our relationship to the Special Olympics?
Marge,He's taken a step. He's really close. All he has to do is not eat a piece before I do.
Marge,Okay. But every man deserves a second chance. As long as he doesn't...
Marge,I'm not hungry. Goodnight.
Marge,Mmm... new cushion smell!
Marge,It's a snuggle dungeon!
Marge,What does this do?
Marge,This is not putting me in the mood!
Marge,Why would you think I'd like this?
Marge,"Really? Jeez, they make everything."
Marge,I'm glad you're okay.
Marge,"Homer, I'm glad that you tried, even though now I can't find the washing machine."
Marge,Ohhh.
Marge,"Not because of what you bought, but because I realized that no matter what, you will never stop trying. And there's nothing a woman loves more than that."
Marge,Actually I'm cool with one of them.
Marge,Not gonna say.
Marge,D.
Marge,Sixteen.
Marge,It sure has taken a beating over the years. Might be time to get a new one...
Marge,"Are there any two words more exciting than ""couch shopping?"""
Marge,But they let me take fabric samples!
Marge,They had to! It came from corporate!
Marge,How did we get bedbugs?
Marge,"I know this seems bad, but nothing brings out the best in Springfield like a crisis..."
Marge,"Everyone, please! Calm down! Reverend Lovejoy is here!"
Marge,So charming. It's like he's selling silver polish at the state fair.
Marge,...debugged and fresh as a daisy.
Marge,"Homer's Pie Man costume, Lisa's red dress, Lisa's red dress, Lisa's red dress, Sunday-best Bart..."
Marge,Where is it? My wedding dress!
Marge,Vodka? Is this Krusty's?
Marge,A high-voltage monkey prod? It is Krusty's! He must have my dress. Let's go!
Marge,I don't want a comedian knowing my dress size!
Marge,What about my dress?
Marge,What do you think?
Marge,Homer! You're not supposed to see the dress before the wedding!
Marge,"Oh sweetie, it's not for me. I wanted you to wear that dress at your wedding."
Marge,"Homer, your daughter doesn't want to get married."
Marge,Tell her she's wrong!
Marge,"Sorry Maggie, I just don't have the touch today."
Marge,How?
Marge,"Thank you for finding it, sweetie. And seeing someone else get married in it is better than having it myself."
Marge,We can have the reception at Wong Lee's!
Marge,Fine. What would you get rid of?
Marge,Fine. I'll just get rid of these Itchy and Mitchys.
Marge,"All right, at least I can delete these Westminster Dog shows."
Marge,"Fine. I'm getting rid of this American Masters ""Kitty Carlisle."""
Marge,It's not what you think!
Marge,Homer Simpson!
Marge,I sent you to the store to get applesauce for Maggie two hours ago!
Marge,What kind of accident?
Marge,That poor man. We've got to do something to change his life.
Marge,"No, no, it has to be something big that'll change his whole outlook. Why don't we take Moe on a road trip?"
Marge,"Moe, this trip is about turning your life around."
Marge,Maybe I should come too.
Marge,Grampa's in charge of you kids while we go to Capital City.
Marge,"Bart, you're in charge of Grampa."
Marge,"Moe, I know things haven't been easy for you. But you're with people who love you in the most exciting of the twin cities."
Marge,"So what do you say, Moe? Will you give me a smile?"
Marge,Thatta boy.
Marge,Yes. 'Cause every time you wear it you'll know how much we love you. Like the one pair of blue pants I bought Homer twenty years ago.
Marge,"Oh Moe, this suit really brings out the herringbone in your eyes!"
Marge,No husband of mine is wearing a tent!
Marge,"And look over there, Moe."
Marge,"Every time I call Grampa's phone, I get no answer."
Marge,"Oh, good. He needs his sleep."
Marge,Moe? What are you doing?
Marge,Thank God the kids aren't here.
Marge,"The suit wasn't magic, Moe. Don't you know the story of Dumbo the elephant?"
Marge,"Well, Dumbo had a magic feather. He thought he needed it to fly, but it turned out the magic was in him the whole time."
Marge,Don't stand up!
Marge,Let me guess... you need a field trip mom?
Marge,A library volunteer? Someone to Purell the CPR dummy?
Marge,What did he do now?
Marge,What did he do in the future?
Marge,"Got it, music lessons!"
Marge,Sweetie... did you ever think of doing something a little more creative with your time?
Marge,I was thinking something more artistic. Something musical. You could take advantage of a fantastic musician living right here!
Marge,That's okay. I...
Marge,"Let's go, Bart..."
Marge,"So, how much are lessons?"
Marge,You'd better be asking for something P.C.: pie or cake.
Marge,There might be some nagging involved.
Marge,"Okay, check your mirrors. Hands at ten and two. Slowly back out of the driveway--"
Marge,"Okay, let's try again."
Marge,Lesson over.
Marge,What are you doing?!
Marge,Stop making Putin jokes!
Marge,Ugh. Speaking of police...
Marge,That's not the way American police do things!
Marge,I am so proud. I would've been happy if Bart was just a piano mover.
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"Bart, I've never been so proud of you. Never, never, never!"
Marge,"You'll need your voice to say ""thanks, Mom"" after your next recital!"
Marge,"Helen Lovejoy, you always have to stir the pot."
Marge,Mopped myself into a corner...
Marge,"Of course. But very, very, very angry at all the time I wasted."
Marge,Gulp?! Was that a gulp? Are you getting a sore throat? Let me give you some castor oil.
Marge,I signed you up for the Ten-And-Below Talent Show next week!
Marge,"Bart, when you were on that stage, it felt like you were pouring those notes right into my heart."
Marge,A proud mother always does.
Marge,I'd like to go home now. And to think you'd do this on Mother's Day.
Marge,Excuse me.
Marge,Did you pass?
Marge,"Well, I'm glad your side of the deal worked out."
Marge,"No, he cheated."
Marge,Thank you!
Marge,"Listen, sweetie... it was wrong of me to force my dreams on you."
Marge,"Sweetie, you're just gonna be who you are."
Marge,"You are unique, you are special, and at some point that's gonna come together and work for you. I know it."
Marge,Wrong. You have to walk all the way over to Grampa to take a plate of cookies I baked.
Marge,Is it your impression of Mr. Burns eating soup? Because I'm not in the mood.
Marge,"I always wondered what you were hiding under your curly locks, my beautiful yellow melon!"
Marge,Confidence is so attractive in a man.
Marge,"Thank you, God."
Marge,Stop it! No Karate Monsters at the dinner table!
Marge,No Karate Monsters in the bathtub!
Marge,I've had it! No more Karate Monsters!
Marge,That's it -- tomorrow we're doing something educational! We're going to the science museum!
Marge,Dammit!
Marge,Finally! Actual science!
Marge,"I still can't believe it was Carl who took your winnings. I thought it would have been you, or you, or you."
Marge,Maybe he had a good reason to give you the ultimate screw-over.
Marge,You don't know where Carl is from?
Marge,Maybe if you'd talked less about guy stuff you'd know more about your so-called friend.
Marge,You're going so far away. I'll miss you.
Marge,We're not broken!
Marge,How am I going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed?
Marge,"Oh, that's perfect."
Marge,"Hi, Homie! Did you get the money? The kids have been stocking up on pool noodles!"
Marge,"I know Carl did you wrong, but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good?"
Marge,Just read the saga and see what it says.
Marge,Our first anniversary.
Marge,"Let's just enjoy our happiness, Homie. Accidental motherhood is the greatest thing that can happen to a woman. And I think Bart's finally outgrown his misbehavior."
Marge,Wish I could get a little of that attention.
Marge,"Homer, you're the anchor store of my heart!"
Marge,"Oh Homie, what a wonderful anniversary!"
Marge,"Oooohhh, I'm going to Hell!"
Marge,"Okay, I've entered my billing address... expiration date... and charged!"
Marge,"Well, thanks for watching Maggie. I just ordered Homer's anniversary gift."
Marge,"Well in the first place, the elephant's cufflinks would be the same size. It's the cuffs that would be bigger. As for Homer, I'm getting him a case of his favorite snack cakes, Dolly Madison."
Marge,"Trust me, Homer doesn't care where the cupcakes come from."
Marge,I just put all my personal information on their website!
Marge,So many unhappy men. How sad.
Marge,"Selma, cheating is a sin. As much a sin as not replying to an instant message. So, if you'll excuse me, I've got a lot of sleazy gentlemen to let down gently!"
Marge,I'm a fan of animation.
Marge,One more to go and I'm done.
Marge,"""Dear 'Horny in Haverbrook,' sorry, I am not interested in cheating on my wonderful husband, who is described in the attached PDF. Say hello to my trash folder, Marge Simpson."""
Marge,"Hi, Homie! A crazy thing happened when I was ordering your anniversary gift."
Marge,Yes. And it's a big one. Remember?
Marge,"Save that sugar for your coffee, Bub."
Marge,He forgot our anniversary again? He remembers the exact number of pork chops in the freezer.
Marge,One of those cyber smoochers wrote me back...
Marge,Good question.
Marge,I thought I was buying snack cakes!
Marge,"I am, and you seem more interested in my day than my husband!"
Marge,Tell me more.
Marge,"Homie, I bet you're wondering why I stayed on the computer until four a.m."
Marge,"Listen, I want us to be honest with each other."
Marge,What? Now? Why?
Marge,He's writing me again! Better put a stop to this.
Marge,"Is that him, getting the text?"
Marge,He's in the market! We might've squeezed the same tomatoes!
Marge,"Gee, I thought you'd be some kind of creep. But you're actually a perfectly normal-looking--"
Marge,"Wait, wait, wait! Let me get the stain out. But not here..."
Marge,I know a place where no one in town will see us.
Marge,There you go. Good as new.
Marge,No Danishes!
Marge,I want to be very clear. I'm a happily married woman. Going on ten years. The aluminum anniversary! Nothing turns leftovers into swans like aluminum!
Marge,"What the heck am I saying? Homer's probably at that bar right now, getting hammered."
Marge,"Well, he keeps falling down a cliff and living, so I guess that's true."
Marge,"Ooh, I love that show!"
Marge,"Such great characters, like Buxton the scheming larder-keep. Why can't Lady Cavendish see he's pilfering the aspic?"
Marge,He says shows set during World War One are too sad. Particularly how everyone's always climbing stairs.
Marge,"Yeah. Alone, I'm sure."
Marge,Why are you singing that?
Marge,Hello! It's Moe from Moe's Tavern.
Marge,Is it me or did this house just get classy?
Marge,Can I have one hour of grownup time where you two aren't tattling on each other or using obscure references?
Marge,No tattling!
Marge,Are you watching it?
Marge,Hmm... Maybe I can help.
Marge,Can you follow everything okay?
Marge,Not a good time!
Marge,The dowager grandmum!
Marge,I've never felt so flushed after watching public television.
Marge,Chat room?
Marge,Show's over! Whoo! That turned ultra-steamy in a jiff!
Marge,That's great. I wonder what surprise your father has in store.
Marge,Where's it from?
Marge,That'll take hours! On our anniversary!
Marge,When does it get better? When he's eight hundred pounds and has to be cut out of the house to go to a movie?
Marge,"That is so sweet! There I go again, settling!"
Marge,I have three kids.
Marge,Get out of my head!
Marge,I said no!
Marge,Leave me alone!
Marge,I'm gonna do what I've done at every key point of my life: suck it in and smile.
Marge,What the?
Marge,Oh my God. Our train! Homie you do care. You care a lot!
Marge,What a wonderful anniversary.
Marge,I'm Marge Simpson.
Marge,Drama! Drama!
Marge,"Ben, Ramona, I wanna tell you something I've learned over ten years of marriage. The secret is: no secrets, except good secrets like this train."
Marge,"Well, I was trying to buy you snack cakes..."
Marge,AND LOVE CONQUERED ALL / WITH A TRAIN FROM THE MALL
Marge,FIND LOVE ON THE NET
Marge,"No! No, that's Bart's cereal!"
Marge,"It's the only way I can get him to take his ""vitamins."""
Marge,Eat up.
Marge,Did you pack everything you need?
Marge,Poor guy.
Marge,Hello! Where's Homer?
Marge,You're talking about my husband!
Marge,Please. I need people here who are helpful and sensitive.
Marge,Homie! What happened to you?
Marge,Why didn't you call us?
Marge,"Well, what made you--"
Marge,Well... I guess all that matters is everything's back to normal.
Marge,Dear Christian God...
Marge,Sorry. Dear God... you know which one I mean... thank you for returning our Homie. He's still got a lot of unfinished business down here.
Marge,Amen.
Marge,"Couldn't agree more! Now, to celebrate... ta-da! Pork chops crusted with Cheeto dust!"
Marge,I've been having snuggle dreams!
Marge,"Oh my, what's that thing you're doing?"
Marge,Who cares what happened? Daddy's back!
Marge,"I know, he's changed."
Marge,For the better! And men don't change that way!
Marge,"Do you know what we're doing on Sunday? Brunch with the Hibberts, then the tile store! He's like a husband in a widow's memory -- perfect!"
Marge,Perfect! Perfect!
Marge,Who are you talking to?
Marge,"Now, I'm off to a party, my outfit is chic. It's a Catwoman costume I'm sure is unique."
Marge,"Just rest on the sofa, I'll be home by ten."
Marge,Just one M & M.
Marge,Mr. Burnsum! You should treat these poor people with respect!
Marge,"Well, you are the best this circus has to offer..."
Marge,"With the mighty tongue God's given you, why can't you speak kindly of these imperfect angels?"
Marge,"I too am a freak. One eye is blue, and the other a pale brown."
Marge,"Never give up hope, my friends."
Marge,"I'm engaged to you, my love."
Marge,Really? How?
Marge,What ring?
Marge,Awww...
Marge,"She's a superfreak, superfreak, she's superfreaky, yow!"
Marge,"Moe, whatever small time together we have will be wonderful."
Marge,What are you doing?
Marge,I said go!
Marge,Poor Chip. Such a big part of everyone's life.
Marge,Not me!
Marge,He's such a little dickens. Although Dickens was pretty well-behaved.
Marge,"I have no regrets about that. It was a perfect pregnancy. Didn't smoke, didn't drink, lost three pounds. And every night before bed, Homer would give me a little kiss... music. Could Bart have been prenatally screwed up by the KISS music?"
Marge,GET UP / EVERYBODY'S GONNA MOVE THEIR FEET
Marge,YOU GOTTA LOSE YOUR MIND IN DETROIT ROCK CITY!
Marge,"Well, for some reason it relaxes me. Now do that thing Gene Simmons does."
Marge,Must find way... to blame myself.
Marge,Lumbar! It means lower back. How many times will you make that mistake?
Marge,Just put on the KISS record.
Marge,"Anything from ""Love Gun""!"
Marge,It's Bart!
Marge,"Chief, what are you doing to save our son?"
Marge,It's all my fault. I should never have listened to those KISS albums when I was pregnant.
Marge,Really?
Marge,Can we focus on my son? Up in the sky?
Marge,"You know what I think about regrets? As long as your family is together, every choice you've ever made is the right one."
Marge,Feels like this play date's gone on forever.
Marge,Did you eat a peanut?
Marge,Yolo?
Marge,"Kirk Van Houten, I hope you're not having a midlife crisis."
Marge,"I'm sorry, but does Kirk know how silly he looks?"
Marge,"Oh Homie, I'm so glad you're happy with your life just the way it is."
Marge,"You've had the same job, same car, same house for twenty years. And that's all you'll ever have. A cycle you'll never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever change. And you're okay with it!"
Marge,Like I say night after night after night: nighty-night.
Marge,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm starting to regret saying Yolo."
Marge,"Postage, marked in pesetas? Who are those letters from?"
Marge,Marge Simpson! It's so nice to meet a friend Homer met through the mail who isn't a sea monkey!
Marge,"Homie, I thought a visit from your old pen pal would cheer you up."
Marge,Ooh!
Marge,"I asked him here to cheer you up, but I didn't think you'd drop everything to go gallivanting with some, no offense, Spaniard."
Marge,"I'm not used to strange men saying the word ""bedroom"" around me."
Marge,That's even worse. Could you say it one more time?
Marge,Ooh!
Marge,They rented everything from Comic Book Guy for ten bucks.
Marge,If you're happy I'm happy.
Marge,I feel kind of... melancholy...
Marge,That's not helping.
Marge,"Jumping on the bed. But I never disobeyed my parents, till I married you."
Marge,I'm a little tired. Could we just snuggle again?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"It's me, talking in your earphone!"
Marge,"Come down, Homie! ""You only live once"" also means when you die, you die!"
Marge,What's going on?
Marge,Are you mocking me?!
Marge,Come on! Just pick one!
Marge,Fine. You can have your old one!
Marge,You can have one of these!
Marge,Again? I was hoping you could spend some time with the kids.
Marge,How was work?
Marge,"Homie? Aw, you're shopping ahead for Maggie."
Marge,What?!
Marge,Why are you saying that?
Marge,First few weeks of what?
Marge,Have you kids seen your father? Surprised he's not here ogling these girls.
Marge,On a Friday afternoon?! I bet he's playing poker again!
Marge,Coming through! Wife on a mission!
Marge,"Wow, I've never burst through a banner before, but it really does the trick!"
Marge,"Homer! I know you're here, your car's outside!"
Marge,Where is he?
Marge,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Marge,"If he's not in there, where is he?"
Marge,So this is where you've been going -- another woman's apartment.
Marge,You have a baby together?
Marge,I'm a Schwarzenegger wife.
Marge,It's not good! None of it's good!
Marge,That is pretty good.
Marge,...so then you delivered her baby right there in the elevator.
Marge,"Well I'm glad you did a good deed, but you shouldn't come here again. I thought that was strange poop on your collar."
Marge,You know what? I think it's fine if Homer spends a few hours now and then with... Homer Junior.
Marge,"It's true, I never specified the home."
Marge,Late night at Moe's eh?
Marge,What about your own children?
Marge,Three.
Marge,Quit talking about that baby!
Marge,This is the last time you'll see that... elevator baby!
Marge,"Oh, for God's sake."
Marge,"Lisa, your food's getting cold!"
Marge,"Well, someone who loves you put melted butter on them!"
Marge,"Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom. I'll tell Lisa you dropped by."
Marge,Lisa? Is everything okay?
Marge,Because you're doing your homework and you don't look happy.
Marge,"They are, huh?"
Marge,"I thought I'd show you this when you were older, but..."
Marge,"It was a crazy time, the eighties."
Marge,You don't hear me listening to the Thompson Twins anymore. Although...
Marge,People's views change. Bobby Kennedy worked for Joe McCarthy. Larry David was on Fridays.
Marge,"Isabel's only eight. As she grows up, surprising things will happen to her body... of beliefs. But she could always use a friend like you."
Marge,"Have a great day, kids. And Bart, I'll pick you up after school to take you to karate lessons."
Marge,"Either way for forty-five minutes you're not my problem, sweetie."
Marge,"Sweetie, about the submarine... what's your favorite food to eat when you're disappointed? I'm going shopping tomorrow."
Marge,"Well, that's sort of what I was trying to say. But..."
Marge,Don't listen to them. They're the ding dongs.
Marge,"Bart, sweetie, this is an opportunity for you to turn things around, yet again. And I believe in you. Yet again."
Marge,Take a look at this.
Marge,"This has gone far enough. I'm starting to think this ""school project"" is more than meets the eye."
Marge,"Bart, don't use language like that!"
Marge,"Homer, you have to take the Halloween decorations down before you put the Christmas ones up."
Marge,"Sorry kids, I guess the hats and mittens will have to wait until next year."
Marge,Look at all these out-of-state license plates!
Marge,"First in Freeways... ""The 'Yuh-Huh' State""... ""Jewel of the Fracking Belt""... ""Still a British Colony at Heart""... ""Land of Many Water Snakes""..."
Marge,"We can't afford Christmas. And when you can't afford Christmas, you've failed as a family. That's what all the big stores say."
Marge,"Well, there's a rec room off the kitchen, but sometimes it's there and sometimes it isn't. Our house is very odd that way."
Marge,"Well, you seem like a nice pushy stranger."
Marge,These are our new boarders!
Marge,"This is a great thing! We're helping people celebrate Christmas, and we'll be able to afford Christmas!"
Marge,"Homer Simpson! Ask yourself -- ""W.W.B.J.D.?"""
Marge,What would baby Jesus do?
Marge,Where is the end?
Marge,"Well, they don't grow on trees."
Marge,Setting it up!
Marge,All eggnog is terrible!
Marge,Why did I do this for money? Why did I do this for money?
Marge,"Enough! Stop! Christmas carols only have one verse! Well they may have more, but the second verse is where they get all weird and religiousy."
Marge,"For your information, Gloria, my ""wassail"" is just Gatorade I put in the microwave!"
Marge,"It's not mistletoe, just cherries and lettuce!"
Marge,I've opened up my house to you. And all you do is fill this joyous season with petty complaints.
Marge,Not now. Take out that pillow and put it in room three.
Marge,Any more questions?
Marge,The pudding will be Jell-O.
Marge,My uncle died in your bed. Merry Christmas.
Marge,"Listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry I overreacted. Thank you all for coming."
Marge,WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR!
Marge,No second verses! They creep me out.
Marge,That one creeps me out from the beginning.
Marge,"Oh, the happy sound of a blender."
Marge,"Ooo, date night! I'll go change my bra!"
Marge,We'll call that nice girl who's getting her Masters in Child Development.
Marge,"Bye bye, Maggie!"
Marge,This is fun! And it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.
Marge,An illegal download? But Hollywood says stealing from Hollywood is wrong.
Marge,"When I watched that pirated movie, I was stealing with my eyes. So I'm repaying the good people in Hollywood for the ticket I should have bought."
Marge,Now this money will end up in the hands of the talented people who make magic happen on the silver screen.
Marge,What's going on here? Is there a fondler in the neighborhood?
Marge,Maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.
Marge,"Lisa, tell your brother that stealing is wrong, no matter what."
Marge,Homer! What are you doing out of prison? You have to go back and give yourself up.
Marge,Your country doesn't think illegally downloaded movies is wrong.
Marge,How is that not stealing?
Marge,I'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.
Marge,It was me! I was the one who told the FBI.
Marge,I was just trying to do the right thing! Who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?
Marge,I never wanted to say funny vows!
Marge,"I didn't mean for this to happen, but... you were stealing."
Marge,"Homer, tell them your side of the story. I know I hurt you, but please trust me now. It'll work."
Marge,But the movie isn't in theaters till next week.
Marge,Homie...
Marge,"Homie, do you really think you should be--"
Marge,Ask Body Spray!
Marge,/
Marge,"Well, come in! I'll explain how it all works. Okay, it helps if she's got a mother she's trying to get back at."
Marge,No woman will be able to resist you dressed like this.
Marge,"Now remember, don't be the way you normally are, and sustain that for the rest of your life."
Marge,"Kumiko, for you we chose the coolest restaurant in town."
Marge,"Homer, I want you to take Kumiko and Comic Book Guy a housewarming present... and maybe check in on them?"
Marge,Apparently including tying the knots on the hammock.
Marge,And getting the termites out of the trees.
Marge,"Homer Simpson, this was your doing. And I want you to fix it!"
Marge,Now!
Marge,"Now, remember kids, the school says you must have a valentine card for everyone in your class."
Marge,What did I say about pointing out the meaninglessness of things?
Marge,Jesus says to love your enemies.
Marge,"Bart, your school requires you to give everyone a Valentine card in an envelope with a fun sticker. Your teacher put out an email alert... with a video attachment."
Marge,What's so funny?
Marge,"I don't understand what's so great about these state of the art, solar-powered, computo-glasses."
Marge,"Homie, I think the kids are just hungry."
Marge,Are you using your glasses for snuggling?!
Marge,I'm afraid wives don't make passes at husbands in those glasses.
Marge,I heard that!
Marge,Here's your breakfast.
Marge,"Well, I'm not happy with you."
Marge,Yoink!
Marge,For once I'm grabbing the goody.
Marge,Why is it the recipe card you need is always the one Homer writes his cocktail ideas on?
Marge,Maybe these bleep-bloop glasses can help.
Marge,"Okay, Marge Simpson, entering the Matrix, for a brownie recipe."
Marge,"Ooo... So many choices, Maggie."
Marge,Who's mommy's little girl? Genealogy dot org says you are. You are!
Marge,Such a good baby! You deserve some ice cream.
Marge,"Maggie, he's here!"
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,"Okay, I guess."
Marge,"I hate when I come here and the first word out of my mouth is Homer. But here we go. Again. Homer was converting our dollars to gyros... not the money, the sandwich..."
Marge,"Well, he's down to two beers in the shower..."
Marge,Everything in the newspaper makes him mad.
Marge,"Hello, Homie! Dinner's almost ready! Pork chops with my secret seasoning!"
Marge,"Oh, absolutely. These sessions keep me on an even keel."
Marge,Dr. Carlock is like my Wednesday reset button.
Marge,"Oh I forgot to tell you, Homie! I bumped into Helen Lovejoy today, and guess what?"
Marge,It's not a secret. It's a funny story.
Marge,"Oh, I bet my story's more interesting."
Marge,"Okay, so Helen Lovejoy told me that she made her famous snicker doodle Bundt cake for the church sale, and she put in salt instead of sugar!"
Marge,That's it. That was the story.
Marge,It got sold.
Marge,Dr. Hibbert.
Marge,Don't take too long!
Marge,"I'm sorry, honey. I'm all out. I spent all I had lighting that candle for Great Aunt Betty."
Marge,"Homer, quit badgering the boy."
Marge,I don't have any diamonds.
Marge,"Bart's usually first in line for Taco night, but now he's ""muy tarde."" Is it all right to say ""tarde?"""
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Lisa!
Marge,Where could Bart be?
Marge,"Well, I hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back. I don't care for how it circles the cat."
Marge,I don't know Bart. This is one of those... Arkham Asylum-type hospitals.
Marge,"Bart, if this is what I think it is, it's not a place we should ever, ever take a little boy."
Marge,Of course not. It's just duck.
Marge,"I have to get to the church. Helen Lovejoy is posting the spring volunteer signup sheet. In five minutes, every good task will be taken! Dang it!"
Marge,Jasper Beardley! You'll never make it!
Marge,"Bake sale -- taken... candle snuffing -- taken... baby shusher, miscellaneous choir support -- everything's taken! All that's left is..."
Marge,"But Ned, saying nay is your thing."
Marge,"Look, I'm really not comfortable talking about S-E-X with K-I-D-S."
Marge,"Hello. Hello. I'm-I'm Marge Simpson. And I'm here to talk about a-a-a wonderful, beautiful thing--"
Marge,Sounds like that would take a while.
Marge,Don't you think the parts that aren't evil are a little pretentious?
Marge,That was a sexual harassment seminar!
Marge,"No! I'm not giving up on reaching those kids, and I might just have a secret weapon."
Marge,Maybe!
Marge,And that's why Nancy No is the most popular girl in Promiseville High.
Marge,I am so tired of those kids sniggering.
Marge,"Uh-oh. It's Horndog Hank. Well, Nancy knows how to keep him away."
Marge,"Darn it, they're stuck."
Marge,"Another seminar tomorrow. I just wish I could connect with those teenagers, since it seems like we'll never have any."
Marge,Are you saying I'm wasting my time?
Marge,Well then maybe I need to give those kids a better example. Goodnight!
Marge,"Shut your eyes, they're too bright."
Marge,"Kids, today we have a very special guest -- my husband."
Marge,"I brought Homer here to show that we can, and have, abstained for two whole days."
Marge,We're here to stop you -- with the help of the teenage abstinence class!
Marge,"If you defeat this madman, I'll release you from your pledge and teach you other fun ways not to get pregnant."
Marge,"Well, that's one of them!"
Marge,"Oh, urgent notice."
Marge,"Grampa, what happened?"
Marge,No kennels!
Marge,When are your relatives going to be here?
Marge,You're both coming home with us!
Marge,"Homie, Homie, we'll be old someday."
Marge,What pills?
Marge,"Homer, how are we doing with those cots?"
Marge,Oh... I'll see what I can do.
Marge,"Well, thanks for the chicken dinner. How did you know I wanted one?"
Marge,Don't call me a gal. Makes me feel like I'm your mother.
Marge,It's eighty-two degrees!
Marge,Are you wearing sock garters?
Marge,Your day is my day! We're the same age! You're turning into your father!
Marge,They're not coming for another twenty-nine years! Did your earlobes get longer?
Marge,"Actually, Homer got up early to count and sort pills. Then he called the police when a Frisbee landed on our lawn. Then he went to the drugstore for an egg cream, but he only brought a nickel."
Marge,I didn't mind that he grew bald... I didn't mind that he got fat... I didn't mind that he got fatter. But no one told me he'd get older than me.
Marge,Maybe.
Marge,"Ooh, what's your hurry?"
Marge,Go! Go! Go!
Marge,Our boat painting!
Marge,"Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about all this hinting."
Marge,"Well, we've talked about it, and if you really want a guinea pig, you'll have to sign this contract."
Marge,"Ooo, that could be the one."
Marge,"Well, they all have their charms..."
Marge,Lisa! You've just gotta choose one. Lisa!?
Marge,"That's okay sweetheart. Your pig thingy didn't mean it. It's just... it felt comforting to know that while we watched TV, there was art going on behind us."
Marge,"Well, I guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting."
Marge,"Oh my gosh, that's beautiful! I've never seen a painting with a lighthouse before."
Marge,This could be our new living room painting!
Marge,"Oh please, Homie..."
Marge,"Oh, it looks great!"
Marge,I've got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from Kirk's bachelor bad. I hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected.
Marge,We should have it appraised!
Marge,Oh my God!
Marge,"Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth. Think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them."
Marge,Kirk and Luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.
Marge,But the Van Houtens are our friends!
Marge,All our friends are like that!
Marge,Well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable?
Marge,How about this... what if we give the Van Houtens twenty-five percent of the money?
Marge,Sure.
Marge,"Okay... I see your point. We should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the Van Houtens."
Marge,"Oh sweetie, you want your parents to be happy, don't you?"
Marge,"If you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing, how could you live with yourselves? We were just trying to be... kind."
Marge,"Luann, I hope we're still on Thursday for collecting used cellphones for the troops."
Marge,See what happens when we get greedy?
Marge,An ATM receipt?
Marge,Five figures!
Marge,I could write a check with... today's date on it.
Marge,Great! Now we're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world!
Marge,Give back the painting! The whole town's turned against us!
Marge,We don't even get this many Christmas cards.
Marge,You really think we're still doing the right thing?
Marge,See what your greed has done?
Marge,"Oh, Homer Simpson, that painting has torn the town apart, destroyed Kirk and Luann's marriage, and everyone's very worried about Milhouse."
Marge,That picture has brought out the worst in everyone! Please... just let it go!
Marge,"Oh, perfect. Now that's art."
Marge,"Homie, there's someone here to see you."
Marge,"To try to avoid any misunderstandings in Brazil, like we had the last time, I'm learning the language."
Marge,Olá!
Marge,Eu amo o Brasil!
Marge,I was just trying to learn the--
Marge,"Eu gostaria de um... hang on, hang on... placa de... hang on, hang on..."
Marge,"""Selecionar conta..."" ooh, ""select account""!"
Marge,I did not pay seven ninety-nine for an app so I could use the English option.
Marge,"You know, you're pretty rude."
Marge,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! I wanna say something!"
Marge,Um... Deixar meu marido sozinho!
Marge,"Yeah, I was a little surprised I wasn't considered before. Todo o meu marido se preocupa é ser um herói para sua filha. Por favor, perdoa-lhe."
Marge,"First, mazel tov! Second, don't! Please, please, I'm a mother. Surely you have a mother too."
Marge,"Homie, what happened?"
Marge,I'll come back with the fire truck. I just have to get the kids to school first.
Marge,Lucas.
Marge,No! You didn't hear anything!
Marge,It's for people who haven't had heart problems!
Marge,Quit comparing me to Ben Chapman!
Marge,"Actually, I'm a little surprised Lisa likes him."
Marge,You can do better!
Marge,"Oh, there's my magazine. Why, look at this! ""What every father should do for his daughter."""
Marge,"Right, right, right, right. According to Judy Kleinsmith, a professional freelance writer, fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would. Then she'll expect the same from the men in her future!"
Marge,It's not a punishment. But you can't just eat dinner. You have to be gentlemanly and attentive.
Marge,Not fake attentive. Real attentive.
Marge,You know Lisa's a vegetarian.
Marge,"No! Homer, you can't just do the things you want to do. You have to act like someone you'd want Lisa to marry. If you just act like yourself, she might just... Oh, you know?"
Marge,"Homie, I love you. But you can be a challenge, like doing the Daily Jumble."
Marge,"Well, I was just trying to--"
Marge,Hair volumizer... Cologne?
Marge,Homie! You look like an N.B.A. coach!
Marge,"All right, you've made your point."
Marge,"Homie, I don't have a problem with you. Except your buttons are off one.... Actually, this is a collar button... see? It goes like this..."
Marge,"Homer, could you come with me for a minute?"
Marge,We need to have a conversation in loud whispers.
Marge,"Homie, I felt terrible when you said I felt ""stuck"" with you. But then, I realized: I am stuck with you. I couldn't stop loving you if I tried."
Marge,"I know, Homie. I know you well enough to know you're not ready to forgive me yet. But I also know you well enough to know that this will work."
Marge,"Remember that sewing machine you say I never use? Well, I sold it and bought this dress!"
Marge,Sh-sh-sh!
Marge,"Oh, of course. You're right, honey. I'll just um, I'll park it at the bar."
Marge,Please let it be a bear that did this.
Marge,"Homie, you can't keep doing this to yourself."
Marge,Horses only live thirty years!
Marge,If you could just ease up on the eating after three a.m. That's all I ask...
Marge,"Thank you, Moe."
Marge,You're alive! But how?
Marge,"Now Homie, I hope you'll use this second chance to live a more sensible life."
Marge,Yes.
Marge,No! I'm throwing you out of the house! You can live with your no-good son.
Marge,"Oh, Moe. Are we doing this again?"
Marge,Let me just say this once: I'm good.
Marge,"After thirty-five years of wifely obedience, I'm married to a face on a screen."
Marge,"How are you, Milhouse?"
Marge,Nothing for thirty years. You're perfect for each other.
Marge,"Well, I don't miss his nonsense. There's a lot of stuff he blamed on raccoons that I'm starting to suspect was him."
Marge,It's only natural to miss a man you buried a hundred and twenty-seven times.
Marge,Phoo! You two don't know what a rough marriage is.
Marge,"Look, life's tough. It's hard to make it through. The only way I know is when you make a decision that comes from your heart, you stick with it."
Marge,"No, I'm going to join him forever."
Marge,"After thirty-five years of marriage, we've finally gotten it right."
Marge,Maggie! Why'd you do that?
Marge,Oh it's amazing how many Cheerios Maggie drops in the back seat.
Marge,"Here you go. Put those in the trash, then you can help me unload the dishwasher."
Marge,"Homie, I can't find my spatula! Can you get another one?"
Marge,"Cheesesteak, a little advice from a mother of three: they'll turn out the same whether you gallop or trot."
Marge,Why can't kids still watch Captain Kangaroo?
Marge,I was making that cake for the block party today! Now there's no choice but to go... store-bought!
Marge,Keep it! Let's go!
Marge,Marge Simpson. Congratulations on little King George.
Marge,Ooh! Game night?
Marge,That sounds like fun. I'll just tell Homer and--
Marge,I don't know... we have church the next morning... starts at eleven...
Marge,Why don't we have any couples friends?
Marge,I want friends. Any friends.
Marge,Not the Van Houtens.
Marge,They're always bragging about their trip to Rome. It was twelve years ago and it was a layover. I want new friends!
Marge,Okay with no friends. That's the saddest thing I can imagine my daughter saying to me.
Marge,We're going to that game party and we're going to be charming and witty.
Marge,"You're not going to eat too much, and we're not going to stay too late."
Marge,"You will not sing unless there's a sing-along, and never take the tray out of the caterer's hand."
Marge,"Don't be too loud and don't be too quiet. When you're too quiet, you get that psycho look."
Marge,And stay in the living room. Don't go to their kids' room and watch a basketball game.
Marge,No.
Marge,One drink.
Marge,"You were charming enough to win me, and that day you didn't have a drink in you."
Marge,Homer!
Marge,I'd like to be alone for a while.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,"Mm, hm."
Marge,That's good.
Marge,"It's okay. I mean, those people didn't even want us at that party in the first place. I think it's time we learned to live with being ostracized."
Marge,"Don't you dare say ""ostrich eyes."""
Marge,Nothing. I give up. No more dinner parties. Our whole social life will be us watching TV and you going to Moe's.
Marge,"Yes, for us. But not for Lisa! Never for Lisa. We're going to help her make friends."
Marge,Those are past-due bills.
Marge,And Lisa will get a friend.
Marge,I don't know! I invited everyone that Lisa's ever met.
Marge,"Oh! Oh no, you're right, Homer! Abort! Abort!"
Marge,"Fine, fine! Homer! Give him a party!"
Marge,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. I'm fine."
Marge,"Right. Right, nothing."
Marge,Pizza. Mmmm.
Marge,"So as her teacher, I was wondering if you could tell me why Lisa has such trouble making friends."
Marge,I wouldn't say I paid someone to be your friend. I just gave her money for records and ice cream.
Marge,"Lisa. Lisa, wait..."
Marge,No. I think I went too far.
Marge,"Hm. Well, that makes me feel better."
Marge,Lisa's door's unlocked!
Marge,"Lisa, just say something to me."
Marge,A mother's greatest fear.
Marge,You're not mad anymore?
Marge,Try to forget that.
Marge,Awww.
Marge,That's a prison road crew.
Marge,The City's broke. The fire department has to raise money by delivering pizza.
Marge,Lisa! Bath time!
Marge,The water's gonna get cold!
Marge,Maybe we should just light sparklers in the back yard.
Marge,Sometimes the language on these gets a little B-L-U-E.
Marge,How permissive?
Marge,"No, no, it's a big thing."
Marge,"Homer, get up!"
Marge,"Krusty, I brought some homemade chicken soup. We used the Play-Doh maker for the matzo."
Marge,But you wear that little spoon around your neck.
Marge,Yes. And I can tell how hard it was to lose your father. But at least you were there to share his final thoughts.
Marge,Well... it could be worse.
Marge,I don't know. Uh... how about... That's a lot worse!
Marge,"Yes, Lisa?"
Marge,"Sweetie, you shouldn't have to worry about such things."
Marge,The doctor gave us this machine to help him breathe in his sleep. Go to bed. I'll take care of him.
Marge,"/ No good, no good. What do I do? What do I do?"
Marge,"/ Oh! Breathe, Homie, breathe!"
Marge,Mammogram appointment.
Marge,Maybe you two are more similar than you'd like to admit.
Marge,"Here's what I would do... in the middle of the night, clean Bart's room for him, then in the morning thank him for cleaning his room."
Marge,Oh it!
Marge,They've been at it all night.
Marge,I-- I don't really know that much about--
Marge,This has got to stop! If you don't go to work you're going to get fired!
Marge,"Oh, thank God."
Marge,I'm afraid Homer and Bart's problems are beyond our power to solve.
Marge,There's only one thing left to try.
Marge,"Ooo, I'm getting a message from your father's fantasy football league. I must still be logged in as him."
Marge,Lenny used the uck-word!
Marge,Ohh.
Marge,Yikes!
Marge,Well I don't like this trash talk. And I'm gonna do something about it. Even if I have to bring in the big guns.
Marge,"Dear Lord, please help Homer's friends understand that make-believe computer football is no excuse for using the internet to be mean."
Marge,It's everywhere.
Marge,The Wi-Fi! The Wi-Fi! I've got to take out the Wi-Fi!
Marge,Then that's what I'm gonna do.
Marge,Lakwando's mind won't be on the game. Aaaand benched.
Marge,And now to make my big move.
Marge,"So, did your sailing adventure help you work out your issues?"
Marge,But that's so many sandwiches!
Marge,"I'll cook this meat, cut it up, and make it into sandwiches."
Marge,"...so, I cooked the meat, sliced it up, made sandwiches, cut off the crusts, fed those to the dog..."
Marge,Ta-da!
Marge,He does it to all of us.
Marge,What's going on? Are you kids eating your feelings?
Marge,Bubble gum cigarettes?
Marge,Ned's letting us use his freezer to store the extra sandwiches.
Marge,"Homie, how much money do we have put aside in case something happens to you?"
Marge,I'm in.
Marge,Uh-huh!
Marge,All you can drink... if you buy a jumbo cup.
Marge,My store. My offset spatula! Mine!
Marge,Your monkey just ate all my turkey.
Marge,No!
Marge,"You seem to have had, and lost, a lot of jobs."
Marge,I'm not sure this is going to work out.
Marge,No lawsuit! You're hired!
Marge,"Well, what do you want a job for?"
Marge,"Professor... could you say ""Welcome to Mother Hubbard's Sandwich Cupboard"" without making any other noises?"
Marge,Would it kill one of you to wash a bell pepper?
Marge,I'm too nervous to sleep.
Marge,I'm sorry I woke you up. I'm just so anxious about tomorrow. What if the store fails? What if I fail?
Marge,"No! No, no, no! It was me that couldn't get to--"
Marge,"Homie, I'm a little worried. Do you know there were no customers between two and four?"
Marge,We don't have drone delivery! You'll have to find a substitute!
Marge,"Mother Hubbard Central expects you to buy a lot of stuff from them. Uniforms, fixins... it's like they don't care if you make money as long as they make money. What kind of corporation does that?"
Marge,Shauna! I saw that! I'm going to have to let you go.
Marge,I'm sorry.
Marge,What am I going to do? I'm down two employees and it's the afternoon rush!
Marge,"Thank you, Homie."
Marge,"Why, why does this have to be so hard?"
Marge,You are working two jobs!
Marge,"I was short-staffed and your father volunteered. Actually, I was wondering if you two might want to lend a hand."
Marge,"I said wash! And Bart, go work the deep fryer."
Marge,"Guys, this is gonna be hard for a while, but we'll get through this... as a family."
Marge,"Gil, I've been meaning to tell you, you're fired."
Marge,As many as you like...
Marge,Take 'em!
Marge,Good baby.
Marge,Good everybody. You won't believe it but we actually turned a profit today.
Marge,"Kids, we're taking some shredded lettuce, pre-sliced cheese, and cold cuts and turning them into the American dream."
Marge,They're opening another Mother Hubbard -- across the street?! How could they? How could they?!
Marge,How could they open another franchise so close to me?
Marge,"I understand, honey. Did you get someone to cover?"
Marge,There is no drive thru!
Marge,"You're working so hard you've lost weight! We're killing ourselves trying to run a restaurant no one goes to... I've never said this to you before, but I'm saying it now. I'm going to Moe's."
Marge,"Now I know why Homie comes here so much. No matter how sad you are inside, what you see looks worse."
Marge,Yesterday's Whatsit? Why does everyone go to them?
Marge,Go on. Please.
Marge,"So you see, Ms. Zengler, the Mother Hubbard's Express across the street is stealing all our business. It's not fair."
Marge,I don't understand you.
Marge,Oh. Now I completely understand you.
Marge,Get the first aid kit!
Marge,"Really? But the franchise agreement says Mother Hubbard Inc. would provide adequate training for all employees, which they didn't. Clause twenty-seven C-3."
Marge,"If you'll just give me back my original investment, I'll take full responsibility for this man's injuries."
Marge,Hear hear!
Marge,Homie! Our prayers have been answered!
Marge,"I couldn't help noticing this school is located in... I'm not one to judge, but... um..."
Marge,"Well, I guess we could try it for a semester."
Marge,Dum got a job at the Tower of London... as a Beefeater!
Marge,"No. You should not be out glugging, shin-slicing, or eye groining! We've got a sweet little toddle to take care of!"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Homer look what someone left in the kitchen. Frosty chocolate milkshakes.
Marge,The milkshakes have vanished!
Marge,Homie... I think we're not alone.
Marge,I'll go make up the couch for you.
Marge,"Homer, do something!"
Marge,Those are in the kitchen!
Marge,I'm just happy you're happy.
Marge,Homer Simpson!
Marge,"So. He likes ghosts better, eh? Fine."
Marge,Huh. Might as well clean this while I'm killing myself.
Marge,I also set up some mirrors so you could watch hockey fights while you eat.
Marge,"Well, I do have a favor. Patty and Selma came home early from their vacation, but the cleaners still haven't gotten all the black mold out of their apartment..."
Marge,...so they need a place to stay. Here.
Marge,You ate the food and looked in the mirrors! They're staying.
Marge,He has a point...
Marge,You know what? I trust them not to smoke.
Marge,What happened?
Marge,"If someone was fracking in our neighborhood, wouldn't we know it?"
Marge,I guess I do.
Marge,But our water was on fire.
Marge,Our water was on fire!
Marge,Our water was on fire.
Marge,Is one of the side effects of fracking earthquakes?
Marge,Homer! Turn off that horrible machine!
Marge,Our. Water. Was. On. Fire!
Marge,You always do the right thing... sort of.
Marge,My sandwich!
Marge,Homer! Homer. I think there's someone downstairs.
Marge,"Oh, don't mention her eye. Don't mention her eye."
Marge,I am so pleased to meet you.
Marge,Well that's better.
Marge,I thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love. Like in Epcot Center.
Marge,"Okay, head count. One, two, three, where's Maggie?!"
Marge,Yes it does!
Marge,Can you please just get us out of this lousy future?
Marge,"It is, 'cause my baby's not in it!"
Marge,Homer works at a nuclear plant! He can help us get home!
Marge,"My sweet baby! Ooh, it feels like you have a full diaper."
Marge,"How was your first day at school, Bart?"
Marge,"Stop that, all of you. It's not Bart's fault that his haircut looks so stupid."
Marge,I didn't know that a teacher could cut kids' hair.
Marge,I'm going to go to that school and talk to that teacher.
Marge,"Well, if he's gonna get a haircut, Bart should at least have gotten a balloon with it."
Marge,"Well, anyway Bart, you'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend."
Marge,The one you booked for us at Owl Haven. The one you have to reserve a year in advance.
Marge,I don't remember that!
Marge,"Don't tell me you didn't reserve a campsite! Labor day is next weekend, there'll be nothing left!"
Marge,Why do I ever put you in charge of the littlest thing?
Marge,My biggest sin is that I dare to hope.
Marge,I want so much to believe you.
Marge,Those were your father's sweatpants.
Marge,BUT WHERE? I STILL DON'T KNOW!
Marge,I'm not sure this campground is family-friendly.
Marge,We brought Cheerios for you!
Marge,"Finally. A normal person. Thank you, Miss... um..."
Marge,Is that tea... adulterated?
Marge,Suddenly this place doesn't seem so bad.
Marge,Ooh. Are you Mr. Clean?
Marge,It's like someone ironed out all the wrinkles in my brain.
Marge,"You always save me, trombone elephant."
Marge,"Homie, you promised me an incredible camping trip and I got one."
Marge,You got very lucky this time. Don't push it.
Marge,When will this tea get out of my system?
Marge,What the?
Marge,WHAT IS THAT RACKET?
Marge,WHAT?
Marge,The bass guitar? This doesn't really seem like... you.
Marge,I can't take it. All Homer does is play that stupid bass! Doink doink doink doink doink doink doink!
Marge,I never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming.
Marge,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. What if -- all the dads jammed together... in a dad band?!"
Marge,You don't know what a per diem is.
Marge,"Oh, sweetie. This band has brought out the best in you."
Marge,Are you okay?
Marge,You sound great! Your licks are really... juicy.
Marge,"You didn't join a band to become famous like in ""Almost Famous."" You loved playing music with your friends. That was enough to make you happy."
Marge,Apu is a good man. He sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the Costington Center.
Marge,"Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him, and you are coming with us to share in his talent."
Marge,See you soon!
Marge,Bart! Hold the ladder still!
Marge,Wish Homer was here.
Marge,Hello?
Marge,I don't know.
Marge,One night. The one night of the year I want Homer home with his family and he can't even do that.
Marge,Homer Simpson!
Marge,"I never thought I'd say this to someone I cared for, much less my husband, but I'm saying it now: I don't want you here on Christmas."
Marge,Out now.
Marge,Why do you always wait till the last minute to put up the lights?
Marge,"Lisa, sweetie, I'm tired of being a pushover."
Marge,You can't smoke!
Marge,Okay then!
Marge,"Moe Szyslak. You didn't climb down our chimney just to say ""Merry Christmas."""
Marge,"Oh, my poor Homie! This is what I was hoping for... for it not to have been completely his fault! Thank you, Moe."
Marge,I've gotta call Homer.
Marge,No answer. Let's go find your father.
Marge,What? I never give up hope.
Marge,"Abe Simpson, please."
Marge,"Well, with all that you folks have experienced, I think we could enjoy listening to a little of your wisdom."
Marge,No casual racism!
Marge,"Well, he's not in the neon sign store."
Marge,I'm sorry. I'm trying to find my husband and nothing's open.
Marge,Where is this party?!
Marge,Homer?
Marge,"Homie, I'm your present tonight. And the present is that I'm not gonna always assume that you screwed up. Because I realize maybe there's a good explanation for what you do. Or a crazy one that's pretty entertaining."
Marge,I thought I had one of those chirping keys.
Marge,You didn't have to do that. I love you just the same.
Marge,"Okay, remember we're parked in the ""Ethnic Princess"" section."
Marge,"C'mon, Maggie. The first ride we go on will be for you."
Marge,I don't like the end sounds on that.
Marge,Homer... Homer...
Marge,"Homer, please! That's creeping me out!"
Marge,Aww.
Marge,Homer! You have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they're a doctor!
Marge,There's only one fair solution: we have to put it to a vote.
Marge,"You're the last vote, Homie."
Marge,Doesn't your culture say anything about mercy?
Marge,What?!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Thank God it's just like her busy box.
Marge,We're receiving a transmission from an unknown source!
Marge,How was your day?
Marge,"Oh, sweetie..."
Marge,"There's a Yiddish word for it: ""shpilkes."""
Marge,You've been working so hard lately. Maybe you should take a break.
Marge,None.
Marge,"Homie... workaholic is probably your best ""aholic"" ever, but you need to relax...so I got us all tickets to see the circus on Saturday."
Marge,I thought you were going to try to relax.
Marge,"Homer, I have to use the Porta Potty."
Marge,No woman uses one of these by choice.
Marge,What did you give him?
Marge,My husband can't really think he's ten.
Marge,So what do we do?
Marge,"Well, I guess it'll have to be in Bart's room. And I thought when Homer cut off his thumb was bad."
Marge,I really do miss my Homie this time of night.
Marge,We're gonna have a lot of mittens this winter.
Marge,Homer... you're not going to school.
Marge,"Fine, you can go to school!"
Marge,"Chief, I hope this is the call I've been praying for."
Marge,"Well, bring him here now! I want my Homie back! I miss him and the things he did!"
Marge,They've run away!
Marge,"Homer, come here."
Marge,"Before you fix him... can you change one little thing? I'm embarrassed to ask this, but after we... snuggle, he always rolls over and goes to sleep and I'd rather..."
Marge,Yes.
Marge,"Well, here's what happened..."
Marge,"Homie, I've missed you!"
Marge,"Oh, so good to have you back."
Marge,"Thank you, Sven-Golly. I knitted us a blanket."
Marge,Maybe he's giving those little baby birds some food.
Marge,"Homer, quick! Get your shooing broom!"
Marge,We love you!
Marge,"So what brings you to Springfield, Mr. Musk?"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Car, wake Grampa."
Marge,What's wrong Homer? Is it that all your friends are out of work and it's kind of your fault?
Marge,"Here's what you do. You just take his hand, look in his eyes and say ""I don't want to be with you anymore."""
Marge,It's gotten me out of a lot of gym memberships.
Marge,"Goodbye, Elon. Our town will never forgive you!"
Marge,Oh Lord.
Marge,"Oh, thank you, Homie!"
Marge,"Homer, it's a standing ovation, get up!"
Marge,Our kids just did something amazing!
Marge,Get up!
Marge,"I'm sorry but I can't. I'm tired of you saying planes have gotten smaller, and two Presidents were fatter than you, and..."
Marge,That's not a healthy way to lose weight.
Marge,You don't have to do this alone.
Marge,"Well that's great, Homie. Just let me finish uploading this photo."
Marge,"Thank you, Lord. And I'll give up online scrapbooking like I promised."
Marge,What?!
Marge,Restore! Restore!
Marge,That's worse than what I thought!
Marge,"Thank you. Although, I think the worst thing that ever happened to my husband was joining your group."
Marge,"Homer, you have to choose. And I think the choice is clear."
Marge,Who's he giving a piggyback ride to?
Marge,He chose to spend the night in a jail with strangers instead of with me.
Marge,"Homer, I want to say something extremely important the way a woman does: subtly through someone else. Kids?"
Marge,"Oh, kids, stop arguing. Or keep arguing. I don't care. Homer, I'm sorry I tried to help you control your weight. I'm not sure of anything anymore. Sorry I ever open my mouth."
Marge,How can you follow a leader who won't even get up out of his chair?
Marge,"It's not that Professor X wouldn't get up, it's that he couldn't."
Marge,That's not really what I was--
Marge,Absolutely.
Marge,"It's because everything you love, you love so much."
Marge,"I've printed out our driving plan! If we work together, we can get Bart to his sports...Lisa to her music...and Maggie to the five birthday parties she's invited to today."
Marge,Homie! Are you dressed? You have soccer setup in twenty minutes! Homie?!
Marge,You're already drinking at eight o'clock in the morning? How much have you had?
Marge,Looks like this is all me.
Marge,"See ya at the bake sale, sucker!"
Marge,Dare I say it? Yippee!
Marge,"Ooh, I didn't know we could decorate our cars."
Marge,So you're a taxi?
Marge,"Well, I drive all day and I don't get paid a thing. With the money you make, I could buy a fridge with... an icemaker."
Marge,Sure!
Marge,Yes.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,At last! I'll earn money for schlepping!
Marge,"You're welcome. And if you really want to get your belly button pierced, go see a professional."
Marge,"I'm... I'm sorry, but I'm not your mother."
Marge,Fine. There's meatloaf...
Marge,Why are you telling me all these things?
Marge,No!
Marge,Homer Simpson. Working with those plants is great! It's helped you get in touch with your feminine side.
Marge,I didn't mean to use that word! It's okay to have a feminine side. It's good in fact!
Marge,Whatever you want.
Marge,"Moe, I think we'd both be a lot happier if we quit our new jobs."
Marge,He's not my lover!
Marge,Yup. And I know a place that could use this smile.
Marge,"Lenny said you were babysitting. And if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home? I could use a night out."
Marge,"Really? Awag? Really? Well, if you think tha--"
Marge,Majesty.
Marge,"Well, not all of them. Like, um, ninety percent?"
Marge,I hope no one was hurt.
Marge,But you don't go to our church.
Marge,Apu thinks we can get the money -- at the casino playing blackjack.
Marge,And it's not even against the rules.
Marge,Not even Homer?
Marge,Even I saw that. I guess I can't tell Homer.
Marge,"Well, to raise money, we're... putting on a revue."
Marge,"Yeah, so, uh, I'm going out to rehearse... the revue."
Marge,"Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... the revue."
Marge,Uh... pop culture and current events.
Marge,Both.
Marge,"Okay... There's a song about, um... how Democrats and Republicans can't get along. It's called ""Cats and Dogs."""
Marge,Disguises? I'm worried that our scam is becoming dishonest.
Marge,"Ok, Mel. I'll be at the casino by ten. Meet me at the lounge by the J. Geils cover band."
Marge,Actually... my friends and I are using a system to win money to save the church.
Marge,It's not gambling! It's math.
Marge,It's not a takedown! And I haven't told him about it -- yet.
Marge,"But it's okay for you guys to know, because you're finally grown-up enough to be trusted with adult information."
Marge,"I'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money. But until then, I appreciate you keeping this very grown-up secret."
Marge,"Homie, Homie, I can finally tell you how we really got the money..."
Marge,This is all my fault.
Marge,Homie. How did you end up at the casino?
Marge,Reverend! Reverend! They took Homer!
Marge,"If we don't give back the money we won counting cards, the casino people are going to hurt Homer!"
Marge,"God's plan?! God isn't some video gamer up there controlling us like we were pac men and dig dugs! God isn't Sky Police. God didn't do this. I lied to my husband, and made my kids lie too! We did this."
Marge,I'm going to do what I should've done in the first place.
Marge,"I don't know if you watch us all the time, or if we're just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf, and every once in a while you check out what kind of crazy tunnels we've built."
Marge,"Maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them. Maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe. And I'm going to sit here and focus on that good, and maybe, just maybe, I'll get my husband back."
Marge,My family loves your microwave lasagnas.
Marge,I want my husband back!
Marge,They sure did... casino management.
Marge,But we don't need to come back. We saved the church.
Marge,"Homie, after all this, do you still believe in God?"
Marge,"Ooo, careful, Homer."
Marge,"Sorry, Excuse us. Pardon me..."
Marge,Oh... Lisa's class.
Marge,"Isn't Bart sweet, Homer? He sings like a little angel."
Marge,Hello.
Marge,"""Dear friends of the Simpson family: We had some sadness and some gladness this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new little cat, Snowball II...so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by herself. Lisa got straight A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all..."""
Marge,...Homer sends his love. Happy Holidays.
Marge,The Simpsons.
Marge,"Oh, for heavens sakes, Homer. It's in the utility drawer."
Marge,"All right, children. Let me have those letters. I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole."
Marge,"A pony? Oh, Lisa. You've asked for that for the last three years and I keep telling you Santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh. Can't you take a hint?"
Marge,"Oh, dear. Maybe Bart is a little more realistic."
Marge,A tattoo!
Marge,You will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Homer?
Marge,"Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit, too."
Marge,"Kids, you want to go Christmas shopping?"
Marge,Go get your money.
Marge,"Oh, I have my secrets. Turn around."
Marge,You can look now.
Marge,"Oh, Bart, that's so sweet. It's the best present a mother could get and it makes you look so dangerous."
Marge,Where's that Bart?
Marge,Cash?
Marge,Thank God for Homer's Christmas bonus.
Marge,"Don't worry, Homer. We'll just have to stretch your Christmas bonus even further this year."
Marge,"I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, you tell me that all the time."
Marge,"But I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus. I keep asking for it, but..."
Marge,Yes...
Marge,"Well, sure, okay..."
Marge,Homer! Why are you seven hours late?
Marge,"But Homer, my sisters are here. Don't you want to say hello?"
Marge,He said he went caroling with Bart.
Marge,Maybe I should call the police.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Good bless him.
Marge,"This is the best gift of all, Homer."
Marge,"Yes, something to share our love --"
Marge,"Take it, Homer!"
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,"All right... hmmm... How about ""he""?"
Marge,"Two points. Your turn, dear."
Marge,"We could look this ""id"" thing up in the dictionary."
Marge,I think it's under the short leg of the couch.
Marge,And a short temper.
Marge,"He's a good boy now, and he's getting better, and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard."
Marge,"Hello again, Principal Skinner."
Marge,Bart?
Marge,"You look very intelligent, dear."
Marge,"Bart, this is a big day for you. Why don't you eat something a little more nutritious?"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Nurturing your brilliant brain, so I got tickets to the opera tonight. Hurry up, get dressed! It starts at eight."
Marge,"Homer, you're going, too."
Marge,"Bart, I feel so bad for going so many years without... uh... hmmm... What's that word where you encourage something to grow?"
Marge,"There's no guy with peanuts, dear."
Marge,Shhh!
Marge,"Bart, stop fooling around. Homer, stop encouraging him."
Marge,Shush.
Marge,Shhh!
Marge,"Well, come on, you two. Don't forget about the film festival."
Marge,"Bart, what happened?"
Marge,What's going on up there?
Marge,"Oh, well."
Marge,"There, there, Homer. You'll find a job. You've caused plenty of industrial accidents and you've always bounced back."
Marge,"Are you all right, Homer?"
Marge,"Well, I've been thinking, too. You know, Homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, Mr. Berger promised I could come back to my old job anytime I wanted."
Marge,Sure! You never forget. It's just like riding a bicycle.
Marge,What?
Marge,"Your father's gone, too."
Marge,There he is!
Marge,"Oh, Homer, how could you think of killing yourself? We love you."
Marge,"Don't be nervous. We believe in you, Homer."
Marge,"You did it, Homer."
Marge,"Oh, Homer. I am so proud of you."
Marge,"Well, everything. Your dip sign, for instance. Now people won't be caught off-guard by that little in the road."
Marge,You don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it. Once."
Marge,"Oh, what an adorable little girl."
Marge,"Oh, I'm not much of a drinker."
Marge,Ummm... Maybe I will take you up on that punch.
Marge,Do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised?
Marge,"Uh-huh. Well, uh... I sense greatness in my family."
Marge,"Well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there and if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average. I don't want to alarm anyone, but I think there's a li'l al-key-hol in this punch."
Marge,Here we sit enjoying the shade.
Marge,Drink the drink that I have made.
Marge,He's here at last my one and only. Good-bye friends and don't be lonely.
Marge,Hey Homie. Did you try the punch?
Marge,"Well, I'm not much of a drinker..."
Marge,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Sorry. Sorry."
Marge,"Ohhh, Homie. I think I'm going to be sick."
Marge,"Homie, get in the car."
Marge,Ohh!
Marge,"But Homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the Man upstairs?"
Marge,Maybe we should move to a larger community.
Marge,"Look, napkins."
Marge,They're having a conversation. They actually enjoy talking to each other.
Marge,"Homer, this is our house."
Marge,"Are you coming in, Homer?"
Marge,"Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?"
Marge,But we don't have that kind of money.
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,"...forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty. Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents."
Marge,"Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?"
Marge,"All our money, the college funds, the TV. Homer, you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you."
Marge,"Now, Doctor, that's not true."
Marge,I don't know...
Marge,Are we cured yet?
Marge,"Bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
Marge,Bart! Lisa! Stop that.
Marge,Arrrgh!
Marge,These are for Lisa's class.
Marge,Arrrgh!
Marge,"Gee, I thought we were making real progress."
Marge,"Homer, how wonderful. Our first pleasant surprise."
Marge,"Excuse me, dear. Shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back?"
Marge,"Oh, Homer... we love you."
Marge,"Uh-uh, Homer. Lisa's making these for her teacher."
Marge,Bart!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"That's better, Homer. Be brave. Bye bye, Bart. You were always my special little guy."
Marge,"Bart, what happened to you?"
Marge,A bully?!
Marge,"Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight to the principal about this."
Marge,"What on earth are you talking about, Homer?"
Marge,"Oh Homer, that's ridiculous. Bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding?"
Marge,Shh! This bully friend of yours... Is he a little on the chunky side?
Marge,Huh huh. And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either.
Marge,That's why he lashes out at the world.
Marge,"So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go."
Marge,Are you boys through playing war?
Marge,Good. Then here are some cupcakes.
Marge,"Oh, Homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck."
Marge,"I'm sorry, everybody. But I've only got two cupcakes for the three of you."
Marge,Homer?
Marge,But they sent a note from school.
Marge,"No, Bart. This note isn't about you."
Marge,"Lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs and I'll draw you a nice hot bath? That helps me when I feel sad."
Marge,"Homer, wake up! Wake up! Oh my, here let me wipe off that drool."
Marge,"Well, I'm still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa. I don't know, Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs attention, but all the while our little Lisa's becoming a young woman."
Marge,"Good night, Homer."
Marge,"Lisa, get away from that jazzman!"
Marge,"Come on, come on. We were worried about you. Nothing personal. I just fear the unfamiliar."
Marge,"No, I'm very upset."
Marge,I'm upset about Lisa.
Marge,"Do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, Bart?"
Marge,"You do love her, don't you?"
Marge,"Well you do, don't you?"
Marge,"Okay, Bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. Be nice to your sister."
Marge,"Go on, Bart. No time like the present."
Marge,"Lisa, you'll be late for band practice. Let's go."
Marge,"Now, Lisa, listen to me. This is important. I want you to smile today."
Marge,"Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. It's what shows up on the surface that counts. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you... and happiness will follow."
Marge,Come on. You can do better than that.
Marge,"Ah, that's my girl."
Marge,"Lisa, I apologize to you. I was wrong. I take it all back. Always be yourself. You want to be sad, honey, be sad. We'll ride it out with you. And when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. From now on, let me do the smiling for both of us."
Marge,"I said you could stop smiling, Lisa."
Marge,"Boys, I'd like your attention, please."
Marge,"I'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game."
Marge,"Oh, calm down, Homer. Lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family."
Marge,"We're just browsing, thank you."
Marge,Homer.
Marge,I'm not sure that we can afford...
Marge,"I don't think we can afford this, Homer."
Marge,It all seems so expensive...
Marge,"Used, isn't it?"
Marge,What are you two doing back there?
Marge,"Homer, I'm telling you this is not the Interstate."
Marge,Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions?
Marge,My feet are getting wet!
Marge,"We all are, dear. Your father says there's nothing to worry about."
Marge,"Oh, Homer. What are we going to do?"
Marge,It is?
Marge,"Oh, I don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands, Lisa."
Marge,The boys certainly are taking a long time. I hope Maggie isn't slowing them up too much.
Marge,"Oh, I'm sure they're just fine. After all, we built a fire and we don't know anything about nature. Imagine what your father, an experienced woodsman, has done."
Marge,"Goodnight, dear."
Marge,There is?
Marge,Why... that's my husband!
Marge,His name isn't Bigfoot. His name is Homer.
Marge,"I don't understand. What's this all about? Well, I suppose pork chops are his favorite."
Marge,Is this going to be on TV?
Marge,"Cheer up, Homer. At least they let you go."
Marge,"Oh, Homer... My brilliant beast."
Marge,"Kids, we're late for church. Get your butts down here right now."
Marge,"Very nice, Maggie. And Lisa you look lovely. Bart, assume the position."
Marge,"Oh, Bart. Now where's your father?"
Marge,"Let's go, Homer."
Marge,"Oh Homer, you promised me..."
Marge,Why should I feel like a traffic cop every Sunday morning when I'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family.
Marge,"C'mon everybody, we're late. Bart, I want you to promise me you'll pay attention in Sunday school. Bart? Bart? BART!!"
Marge,What's this? A personal stereo? Were you going to listen to rock music in Sunday school?
Marge,"Can you believe this, Homer? ... Homer? ... Homer?"
Marge,Homer! Were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over?
Marge,It's because of your irreverent attitude that Bart thinks he can sneak headphones into Sunday school.
Marge,"Now, move it!"
Marge,"Yeah. Sit down, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation, and today's sermon was one you should have really listened to."
Marge,Gambling.
Marge,"No! Look, I don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids. Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in Sunday school today?"
Marge,"No way, Jose."
Marge,"Um mmm. I know what those movies are like. Killing innocent people, eating human flesh. You just get a lot of bad ideas."
Marge,"Bart, are you all right?"
Marge,Well then come down for breakfast.
Marge,It's a statue of the trailblazing founder of our town.
Marge,"Go on, Lisa. We've all got to be brave just like Jebediah when he killed that bear."
Marge,"Why, Bart, why?"
Marge,Where did you get a ridiculous idea like that?
Marge,"Homer, did you have something to do with this?"
Marge,A little?
Marge,"Well, isn't this nice?"
Marge,"No, Homer. It's mine."
Marge,Umm-hmm.
Marge,"Patty, he's out buying me something right now."
Marge,I'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.
Marge,"Well, Homer and I had a lovely dining experience at Chez Pierre... or the Rusty Barnacle is nice..."
Marge,The place where the waiters sing.
Marge,Homer?
Marge,"Homer, we're having dinner tonight at the Singing Sirloin."
Marge,And the kids.
Marge,...And my sisters.
Marge,"Oh, perfume."
Marge,"Whoa... hmmm. Thank you, Bart."
Marge,Uh... I-I'm saving it... for a special occasion.
Marge,"But this occasion is already so special if we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special."
Marge,"Well, it's hard for me to judge since I've never bowled in my life."
Marge,"You bought that bowling ball for you, not for me."
Marge,The holes were drilled for your fingers.
Marge,You never intended for me to use that ball.
Marge,You can't take it back. You had your name engraved on it.
Marge,"Homer, I'm keeping the ball. For myself."
Marge,Hmmm. I'll just use my ball.
Marge,"I'm keeping it and I'm going to use it. Thank you for the present, Homer."
Marge,Excuse me... where do I throw this?
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,"No, thanks. I'm just here out of spite."
Marge,Hm. Well... all right.
Marge,Never you mind.
Marge,Thirteen. Double A.
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,A little warm and moist.
Marge,I don't see what he's doing that's so different from what I'm doing.
Marge,Oh!
Marge,I'm awfully sorry.
Marge,"Oh, no, no. Homer is my... ball's name. I'm Marge."
Marge,"No... no, thank you, Mr... uh... ... Brunswick."
Marge,Jacques.
Marge,Hmmm.
Marge,Sure.
Marge,Never.
Marge,No.
Marge,"Oh, I don't want to trouble you."
Marge,All right. But I'm not very good.
Marge,I can hit that one pin all right. But the rest of them don't even wobble.
Marge,Oh!
Marge,But...
Marge,You're a very good teacher!
Marge,No.
Marge,"Oh, that's very funny."
Marge,"Oh, dear, I didn't realize there was so much to this game. What do you charge for lessons?"
Marge,Twenty-five dollars!
Marge,Oh. Well... all right. When do we start?
Marge,"Hm, very smooth."
Marge,"Yes, very."
Marge,Yes.
Marge,Smooth.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,Hmmm.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,Homer... Homer.
Marge,It's a very challenging hobby.
Marge,Umm-hmm. But I think I'll do much better tomorrow night.
Marge,"Well, sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again?"
Marge,"Good night, Homer."
Marge,"Oh, Jacques! It fits. You got it in my size and it has my name on it. It's really for me."
Marge,You didn't have to drop me off.
Marge,"Oh, Jacques, I'm a married woman."
Marge,What's brunch?
Marge,I don't think so.
Marge,"Oh! Oh! Well, all right."
Marge,"What, Homer?"
Marge,"Here you go, kids. Special lunches. Lots of good things for growing bodies and some treats just for fun."
Marge,"Hm, yes, I am, as a matter of fact. Here's more treats. But don't worry, your dad will take care of dinner."
Marge,"Goodbye, Lisa. My darling little Lisa."
Marge,"Goodbye, Bart. My special little guy."
Marge,I'm a married woman. Please don't call me that.
Marge,"Oh. Well, thank you."
Marge,"Oh... yes, hello, Helen."
Marge,We're... uh...
Marge,Hmm-hmm.
Marge,"Goodbye, Helen."
Marge,That doesn't shock me.
Marge,Sure.
Marge,You certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
Marge,Really!?
Marge,Please.
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,Destiny?
Marge,Like two fragile bowling pins...
Marge,Until inevitably...
Marge,Is Thursday okay?
Marge,Sure.
Marge,"Goodbye, Homer."
Marge,Of course.
Marge,So how was the office birthday party?
Marge,Does this girl like him?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"You are not a blimp, Homer. You're my big cuddly teddy bear."
Marge,"Don't strain yourself, dear."
Marge,"Homer, is this some kind of stag party?"
Marge,Eugene Fisk? Isn't he your assistant?
Marge,Didn't he used to be your assistant?
Marge,"Sorry, Homer."
Marge,Bart.
Marge,Go take some wildlife pictures or something.
Marge,"Stop it, you two, and put on some nice clothes. Since it's just the four of us tonight, we're having dinner at the Rusty Barnacle."
Marge,Your father. He's having a boys' night out.
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"Oh, Bart. Excuse me, sir. The party next door seems to be a little raucous. Could you please ask them to quiet down a little bit, please?"
Marge,Bart! Quit fooling around and eat your dinner.
Marge,"Okay, but don't dawdle. Your food will get cold."
Marge,What are we laughing at?
Marge,What is the meaning of this?
Marge,Princess who?
Marge,Why you big...
Marge,"Bart, go to your room!"
Marge,"Homer, I don't even want to look at you right now."
Marge,My suggestion is for you to sleep in the filth you created.
Marge,"Here, if you have any soul left, you'll need these. I know I will."
Marge,Who is this?
Marge,Homer! You don't even know why you're apologizing.
Marge,"I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very bad lesson. Your boy idolizes you."
Marge,"Yes he does, Homer. And when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. You owe your son better than that, Homer."
Marge,"Well, I think you should take Bart to meet this exotic belly-person. I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her."
Marge,Do it!
Marge,"Oh, he's sunk even lower!"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Homer! What happened?
Marge,"Bart, if you had cleaned up your room when I asked you to, your father's trick back would still be aligned. So you pick up this mess right now."
Marge,"Oh, Homer. How many times do I have to fluff your pillow?"
Marge,Well... okay.
Marge,"I know how you like 'em, Homer."
Marge,Principal Skinner!
Marge,"Homer, Principal Skinner's here."
Marge,"Oh, dear."
Marge,Deportation! You mean kick Bart out of the country?
Marge,Homer! You didn't even ask where Bart would be going.
Marge,But Bart doesn't speak French.
Marge,"Well, going to France sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but I think Bart should have a say in this."
Marge,"Bart, how would you like to spend the next three months living in France?"
Marge,"Yes, Bart."
Marge,"Mmm-hmm. Well, Bart seems very enthusiastic about the idea."
Marge,Yes! Yes!
Marge,"Goodbye, my special, my special little guy. You will write us, won't you?"
Marge,'Bye. We miss you.
Marge,The life jacket is under the seat.
Marge,Adil?
Marge,"Well, I guess for the next few months, yes, I'll be your mother."
Marge,"Well, now that that's settled, I'll just clear the dishes."
Marge,Oh. Okay.
Marge,Homer!
Marge,Lisa!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,You sure have taken a shine to little Adil.
Marge,"Well, okay, I will. If you admit you love Bart."
Marge,What?
Marge,Oh... Adil's a very sweet boy.
Marge,"Dear Bart, How is France? I don't know why you haven't written. I guess you're just having too much fun."
Marge,"Everyone here in the United States is fine. We think Maggie may say her first word any day now. Lisa got an A in Math, which I'm only mentioning as news -- I'm not putting you down. And your father, well... last night he went to sleep talking about how much he loves you."
Marge,Remember to dress warm and try to be as helpful as you can to your adopted parents.
Marge,"Hello, Homer. What's that?"
Marge,"Oh, my."
Marge,"Goodbye, Adil. It was a pleasure..."
Marge,"Oh, Bart, my baby boy. Welcome home."
Marge,"Homer, I'd love a glass of that wine Bart brought us."
Marge,All this senseless violence. I don't understand its appeal.
Marge,"Hello, Homie. I was hoping you could pick up a half gallon of premium ice cream on your way home from work."
Marge,Patty and Selma are coming over to show us slides from their trip to the Yucatan.
Marge,"Ooo, I've got to go, Homer. My sisters are here."
Marge,"Oh, eight carousels. We're in for a real treat!"
Marge,Mmm-hmm.
Marge,Hmmm hmmm.
Marge,"Hmmm, very... thorough."
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,"I know it looks very bad, honey -- but who knows? Maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along."
Marge,These toys are just adorable. Who'd have guessed they were inspired by an insane criminal genius?
Marge,You forgot the special lunches I made.
Marge,Now just a darn...
Marge,"Well, Maggie, it's just you and me again."
Marge,"Hello, I'd like to talk to Dr. Monroe."
Marge,"I'm Marge, thirty-four, and my problem is my husband. He doesn't listen to me. He doesn't appreciate me. I don't know how much more of this I can --"
Marge,"Well. When we were dating he was sweeter, and more romantic, and forty pounds thinner, and he had hair, and he ate with utensils."
Marge,Ohhh.
Marge,"Oh. Okay, well thank you."
Marge,Really?
Marge,Leave Homer?
Marge,Leave Pedro?
Marge,Yeah.
Marge,Yeah.
Marge,Yeah.
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,"I love you, too."
Marge,"But, Homer, it's so expensive."
Marge,"Oh, oh, Homer. I feel giddy. Wait, what about a babysitter?"
Marge,Not to worry.
Marge,"Goodness, must be a crossed wire."
Marge,This is Marge Simpson. I'd like a babysitter for the evening.
Marge,"Well, tonight is a very special night. Your father is taking me out for dinner and dancing."
Marge,Like an angel.
Marge,Precious? I think I hear the doorbell.
Marge,You must be the babysitter.
Marge,"Thank you for coming on such short notice, Ms. Botz."
Marge,"Here are the phone numbers of the restaurant where we'll be dining and the motel where we'll be spending the night. You'll have to put Maggie to bed now. But Bart and Lisa can stay up for another hour. Until then, they can watch a tape from our video library."
Marge,"'Bye, now. Be good. Gotta go."
Marge,"Homer, you look just like a little boy."
Marge,No. Because you're wearing a bib.
Marge,Except for one thing... no chaperone.
Marge,"Oh, there it... went."
Marge,"Okay, but watch out. Don't slam my head like last time."
Marge,Don't muss my hair.
Marge,Wheeeee!
Marge,This is fun!
Marge,Maybe I'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.
Marge,You'll see.
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, would it spoil the mood if I called home? You know, just to check on the kids?"
Marge,"Homer, wake up. There's no answer at home."
Marge,"So, I'm worried. I think we should go home."
Marge,How come all the lights are on?
Marge,I can't tell you how chagrinned we are about all of this.
Marge,"Oh, Homer, don't say that. The way I see it, if you raise three children who can knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger, you must be doing something right."
Marge,Oh my goodness.
Marge,"Soup's on! Hurry up, or it'll get that icky skin on the top."
Marge,"In a second, Homer. Lisa has some good news."
Marge,"Homer! Go ahead, Lisa."
Marge,Oh! The little tiger tries so hard. Why does he keep failing?
Marge,"Bart, honey... you're going to miss your bus!"
Marge,"Yes, dear?"
Marge,"Oooh, your third bowl... I think you may be on the mend. Is there anything else I can get you?"
Marge,Of course. Homer!?
Marge,Bring the television up. Bart's got his vision back!
Marge,"There, there, Bart. You're just a late bloomer."
Marge,"Well, maybe it would help him to be left back. It won't be so bad, Bart."
Marge,"Bart, it's past your bedtime."
Marge,"Wake up Bart, rise and shine, little guy. Time to wake up."
Marge,Wake up and look at the snow.
Marge,Remember to take a break if your arms go numb!
Marge,"Hitler, North Dakota?"
Marge,"You know, some women find bald men quite virile."
Marge,"He's much happier at work and, well, just between us girls... well, he hasn't been this frisky in years."
Marge,"Homie, my sisters are here."
Marge,"Hello, Homie. How's my big important executive?"
Marge,He sounds good. Hire him.
Marge,"Happy anniversary, Homer."
Marge,"Don't worry, Homie. This year you have an excuse for not remembering, what with your job and --"
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,"I love you, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, between your hair care products and new wardrobe, we're not saving anything for a rainy day?"
Marge,"Homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Oh Homie, I'm so sorry."
Marge,"Homer, are you still awake?"
Marge,What's wrong?
Marge,"Oh, Homer. Your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it."
Marge,"Oh, Homer, honey. Come here."
Marge,"Come here. ""YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / CAN'T YOU SEE? / YOU'RE EVERYTHING THAT I HOPED FOR /"
Marge,"Hello, everyone. You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... things on T.V. that are completely inappropriate for younger viewers. Things like the following half hour. Nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, which I totally wash my hands of, is really scary, so if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight, instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. Thanks for your attention."
Marge,I still can't believe how inexpensive it was.
Marge,"Well, he certainly must have been motivated. Prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able to afford this."
Marge,It just seems too good to be true.
Marge,What on earth was that?
Marge,Hmmm. This kitchen certainly could use a woman's touch.
Marge,Homer! What's this thing in the corner?
Marge,Evil!
Marge,"Children, get your coats. We're leaving this house right now."
Marge,I'm not going to live in a house of evil just to save a few dollars.
Marge,All right. But if anything happens...
Marge,"I'm in the kitchen, Homer!"
Marge,What's going on out here? Homer! Bart! Lisa! Maggie! Stop it!
Marge,"That does it. Children, get dressed. We're leaving."
Marge,"I don't care what I said. This family has had its differences, and we've squabbled, but we never had knife fights before... and I blame this house."
Marge,"Let's go, children."
Marge,Homer...
Marge,Shush! Shut up! Quit trying to push us around. Stop saying those horrible things and show some manners.
Marge,Look at me. I've never been so angry. My hands are shaking.
Marge,Don't talk to her like that.
Marge,"Oh, don't call me lady. My name is Marge Simpson, this is my family and we're not going anywhere. We're all going to have to live together, so you better get used to it... please."
Marge,Sure.
Marge,"Homer, all these flies."
Marge,You... you speak English.
Marge,"Well, thank you very much, Mr....?"
Marge,Ewww.
Marge,"Look, Homer! Radish rosettes. These are hard to make. They are a very advanced race."
Marge,Sorry. Your game is very nice.
Marge,Will we be invited?
Marge,"For a superior race, they really rub it in."
Marge,"Lisa, see what we mean when we say you're too smart for your own good?"
Marge,Like what?
Marge,"Children, bedtime."
Marge,"Homer, I am not sleeping with the lights on. They're just children's stories. They can't hurt you."
Marge,Well leave it to good old Mary Bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.
Marge,"You're late for work, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family."
Marge,"Well, frankly, I don't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against Mary Bailey, the most beloved governor our great state has ever known."
Marge,I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
Marge,Homer... I'm a Bailey Booster.
Marge,What!
Marge,Absolutely not!
Marge,Huh uh. I'm going to be ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey that night.
Marge,Well I think the non-card question is a valid one.
Marge,"No, I'm just fine right here."
Marge,"Well, I don't feel like snuggling."
Marge,I don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself.
Marge,"Okay, Homer. Fair enough. You got it! All right! Good! That's it. That's how I'm gonna express myself. That's right. Goodnight."
Marge,"I'm sorry, dear. It will all be over soon."
Marge,"Lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt."
Marge,"Can I have your plate, Mr. Burns?"
Marge,Homer... Homer... make them stop.
Marge,"Homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling, and sleeping till noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them."
Marge,"I hope you'll space out the tubs this year, Homer."
Marge,"Well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire."
Marge,"Well, he's a fine role model. Bart, give me that ball!"
Marge,"Here you go, Bart."
Marge,Homer... Homer... X.Y.Z.
Marge,All this means is you can't wave your fanny in public.
Marge,"Now, Homer."
Marge,"Did the team ask you to dress like that, Homer?"
Marge,A Simpson on a T-shirt. I never thought I'd see the day.
Marge,"Homer, I'd be lying if I didn't say that this scares me a little. But we all have a calling, a reason The Almighty put us on this Earth. And yours might be to dance on dugouts."
Marge,"Let's do it, Homer!"
Marge,"Well, we have one quick stop and then it's on to Capital City."
Marge,Look! The Crosstown Bridge!
Marge,"Look, it's Tony Bennett!"
Marge,Fourth Street and D!
Marge,"Awww. Come to bed, Homie."
Marge,"See you after the game, when you're a big star."
Marge,"Let's see. Upper, upper, upper mezzanine. Hmmm. Yes, these must be ours."
Marge,You'd think the player's wives would be a little closer to the action.
Marge,I don't know.
Marge,Would you like some fruit juice?
Marge,Now stop it you two. And don't look too down. I'm sure this is hard enough for your father.
Marge,"Now, now, Homer. Bart's busy working on his science project."
Marge,"Homie, quit tossing."
Marge,What exactly did he say?
Marge,"Well, how did he say it?"
Marge,Was he angry?
Marge,Was he rude?
Marge,"Homer, I'm your best friend, but I've gotta say, I've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor."
Marge,"Well, he's not perfect, but he is very..."
Marge,I think it's terrible. A man opens his heart and you make fun of him.
Marge,"Now, just a minute."
Marge,Bart!
Marge,I wish this family was as close as the Flanders.
Marge,Hmmm. I was going to wash my hair.
Marge,You brought food...
Marge,"Homer, I couldn't help overhearing you warp Bart's mind."
Marge,"Well, I'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament."
Marge,"Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?"
Marge,The father of the loser mows the lawn -- 
Marge,The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.
Marge,Now I suppose you both have to sign this. I hope blood won't be necessary.
Marge,Homer?!
Marge,"Here you go, Bart. A lumberjack's breakfast for my little golfer."
Marge,"Ohhh, well, what won't make him logy?"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"Oh, my best dress."
Marge,"Homer, you promised to be nice to my sisters."
Marge,"Honey, please. You're in the way."
Marge,"Well, okay. Let's see... Can you do the cranberry sauce?"
Marge,The can is in the cupboard on the bottom shelf.
Marge,"No, no, no, the other shelf."
Marge,Open the can.
Marge,It's in the second drawer from the right.
Marge,"No, no, no, no, the other one."
Marge,"I don't think that it's broken, honey. Here, let me try."
Marge,Here you go.
Marge,Just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done. Bart. Bart?
Marge,"Homer, shouldn't you go pick up Grampa?"
Marge,You knew that I was cooking a turkey.
Marge,Mom! You made it! How are you!
Marge,"Dinner! Dinner time, everybody! Dinner!"
Marge,"Okay, Lisa, we're ready for your centerpiece!"
Marge,Lisa! My goodness! That's very impressive!
Marge,"Now, just wait a minute! I'm sure there's room for both."
Marge,"Yes, you do! I hope you're happy, Bart! You've RUINED THANKSGIVING!"
Marge,"Oh, why don't I go talk to her?"
Marge,"Honey, your food is getting cold."
Marge,"Lisa, I'm very sorry about what happened."
Marge,"I've noticed that, too. Well, when you feel like coming down, we'll be there."
Marge,"Bart, you can come down to dinner as soon as you're ready to apologize to your sister. And it's going to be a real apology in front of everybody, and you have to mean it."
Marge,"Everyone, Lisa wants to read us a poem she's written."
Marge,"Oh, no! My sweet little Bart!"
Marge,And I said he ruined Thanksgiving...
Marge,"Homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't blame ourselves."
Marge,Children need discipline. You can ask any syndicated advice columnist.
Marge,Bart? You're home!
Marge,"Oh, my special little guy! We were so worried!"
Marge,"Bart, isn't there something you'd like to say to your sister?"
Marge,"No, no, no! That won't do at all!"
Marge,Now we can blame him for everything.
Marge,Lisa's recital is Saturday night.
Marge,"Now, come on, you two. What time does your little truck game start?"
Marge,"Well, Lisa's recital starts at five o'clock. We could go to both."
Marge,"Sit down, Homer."
Marge,"Homer, drive defensively."
Marge,"Ooo, I think there's one over there."
Marge,Homer.
Marge,Thank you so much.
Marge,"Hmmm, well, thank you. Gee, everyone's so nice here at the Monster Truck Rally. Look, Homer, champagne!"
Marge,"Wow, a woman mud-pull driver."
Marge,"Yes, well, we saw a daredevil last night and, well, you know, monkey see, monkey do."
Marge,What a fun-filled evening.
Marge,"Oh, my little boy, ."
Marge,Are you all right?
Marge,"Gee, I never realized TV was such a dangerous influence."
Marge,"Homer, you're his father. You've got to try and reason with him."
Marge,"Oh, come on, Homer. A heart to heart talk with your son, you've got to try."
Marge,"How'd it go, Homer?"
Marge,"Well, he's got a pretty good father."
Marge,A dash of rosemary... a smidgin of thyme... a pinch of marjoram...
Marge,"Oh now, Homer, they're nothing special. The extra ingredient is care."
Marge,"A sprinkle of chervil, half a teaspoon of turmeric... and a whisper of MSG."
Marge,You don't have to go to all that trouble just for me.
Marge,Humph... where would an innocent child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet?
Marge,"No, Maggie! Bad baby!"
Marge,So television's responsible.
Marge,"Well, you won't be watching these cartoons anymore. Ever."
Marge,I wonder why Bart and Lisa are so late getting home from school?
Marge,Because.
Marge,Because I said so.
Marge,Homer! I'm trying to work!
Marge,I'm cataloguing the violence in these cartoons. I don't think adults have ever actually sat down and watched them before.
Marge,What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
Marge,This is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers?
Marge,I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write a letter.
Marge,Dear Purveyors of Senseless Violence: I know this may sound silly at first...
Marge,... but I believe that the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way...
Marge,... please try to tone down the psychotic violence...
Marge,"""... in your otherwise fine programming. Yours truly, Marge Simpson."""
Marge,... and the horse I rode in on!?
Marge,"Well, that's what we want them to do, Homer."
Marge,"Well, I've never changed the world before, so I don't know how long it takes exactly. But if enough people take an interest..."
Marge,Snuh!
Marge,"It stands for ""Springfieldians"
Marge,"for Nonviolence, Understanding and Helping."""
Marge,I've started a crusade against cartoon violence.
Marge,I can protect my own children.
Marge,but there are many others whose minds are being warped every afternoon at four.
Marge,All right.
Marge,Have fun.
Marge,And what happens when a child grows up with insanely violent role models like these?
Marge,The answer is all around you.
Marge,How many of you were hit on the head with mallets last week?
Marge,No.
Marge,No. I'm sorry about the dinners. I'll make up for it tomorrow night.
Marge,No one.
Marge,"Hmmm, sure. Oh, dear. I can't. I've got three protest rallies tomorrow."
Marge,What do we want?
Marge,When do we want it?
Marge,What do we want?
Marge,HER GROUP
Marge,Substantially-less
Marge,violence-in children's-program-ming.
Marge,KRUSTY
Marge,No! You're ruining the show. Oh... Oh... Oh. Stop.
Marge,Please stop. Please. Be quiet.
Marge,"Oh, please. All right. I'm trying to earn a living here. All right! Stop! Stop!"
Marge,So much needless brutality. I don't know if I'm having any impact at all.
Marge,Mmmmmmmph!
Marge,"What is it? What? ""Smartline?"" Yes, I've heard of your late-night panel discussion show. Well, I'd love to."
Marge,Excuse me. Excuse me. He was addressing me.
Marge,Excuse me. There is! I think that it's a bad influence on children.
Marge,Ohhh.
Marge,Yes. I'd like to ask all the parents in Springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel. Thank you.
Marge,Hello?
Marge,Yes.
Marge,Yes?
Marge,Well... what's the problem you're having?
Marge,Huh huh.
Marge,Oh dear!
Marge,Well... let's see... Oh! couldn't Itchy share his pie with Scratchy? Then they would both have pie.
Marge,It's time for Krusty.
Marge,"Yes, dear. All you want."
Marge,I think it conveys a very nice message of sharing.
Marge,Aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?
Marge,So what did you kids do today?
Marge,That's nice dear.
Marge,Sure.
Marge,I didn't really expect things to change this much.
Marge,What in the world?
Marge,"Hmmm, but that's Michelangelo's David. It's a masterpiece!"
Marge,But I like that statue.
Marge,I'm not. I think everyone in Springfield should see it.
Marge,Hmmm... yes and no.
Marge,"Well... I guess I can't, which is a shame because I really hate those cartoons."
Marge,"Um, I don't know. I guess one person can make a difference, but most of the time, they probably shouldn't."
Marge,David.
Marge,"Oh, Homie. Here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other."
Marge,"Really, why?"
Marge,"Aw, well isn't that nice."
Marge,Bart! Bart!
Marge,"Oh, Bart! We thought for a minute you'd gone away from us."
Marge,"Mr. Hutz, this is hardly the time or place to discuss this."
Marge,"Is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably, doctor?"
Marge,Hmmm.
Marge,Oh!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"That's right, he did. Excuse me, but Dr. Hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought Bart was fine."
Marge,"Well, maybe Lisa does have a point. I don't mind you boys doing this in the living room, but in court doesn't Bart have to tell the truth?"
Marge,I didn't know you liked animals.
Marge,Goodness!
Marge,I don't know. Maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us.
Marge,"What do you think, Homer?"
Marge,"Homer, what's happened to you? All this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --"
Marge,Do you know what I'd settle for if it was up to me? Bart's medical bills and an apology!
Marge,"Yes, I do."
Marge,"Yes, he's been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day I became a mother. He's seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care."
Marge,"I'm sorry, but my mother always said, ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."""
Marge,"Well, to be honest, he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping Bart in bandages than in making him feel better. And he mispronounced words that even I know, like abdomen. And his office was dirty. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure he's even a doctor."
Marge,"Well, I don't know how intense it was..."
Marge,"...but, well, I guess he did miss three days of school --"
Marge,"...although he doesn't really like school all that much,"
Marge,...so I guess that may not count as anguish.
Marge,It was a little hard on me having him around the house
Marge,...all that time.
Marge,"Well, we pay Bart five dollars a week to take out the trash..."
Marge,"I suppose if he'd been able to do it that week, we might have given him the five dollars."
Marge,Um-hmm.
Marge,"Homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?"
Marge,Some string beans?
Marge,Some celery with cream cheese on it?
Marge,"Bart, please."
Marge,Sure.
Marge,My woman's intuition is telling me something... I wonder what... Oh my god.
Marge,My name is Marge.
Marge,"Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing."
Marge,"We've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- I mean, I know this is different than that time I washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but I--"
Marge,"What are you saying, Homer?"
Marge,"Oh my Lord. Well, I don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out."
Marge,"Homer, look at me."
Marge,I love you too!
Marge,"Your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, Homer."
Marge,"Get it while it's unbelievably hot, kids!"
Marge,"Well, maybe Lisa's right. Tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner."
Marge,There's that new sushi restaurant on Elm Street.
Marge,"Please, Homer. Can't we try it?"
Marge,What would you recommend for a family that's not sure they should be here?
Marge,I'll have one of those.
Marge,"I'm sorry, Homer. Have you thought about what you want to tell the kids?"
Marge,"Well, have you decided what you want to do tomorrow?"
Marge,When we're intimate?
Marge,Can I just make one suggestion? Can we get up early and watch the sunrise together?
Marge,You looked so peaceful lying there.
Marge,Because sometimes it's fun to dress up for dinner.
Marge,Because sometimes it's fun to use the good china.
Marge,Sometimes it's fun to use candles.
Marge,Because we love your father and enjoy his company.
Marge,"Oh, where can he be?"
Marge,Homer!
Marge,"I wrote a poem for you this afternoon, Homer. It's called, ""To A Husband."""
Marge,"Ahem. ""The blackened clouds are forming ..."""
Marge,"""... Soon the rain will fall / My dear one is departing/ But first please heed this call / That always will I love you / My one, my love, my all."""
Marge,Homer? Homer?
Marge,"Oh, Homer, Homer."
Marge,"His drool! It's warm! He's alive! Homer, Homer, wake up, you're alive!"
Marge,Wake up! You're alive! You're alive!
Marge,You're alive!
Marge,I think this is sick. They're staring at a dot!
Marge,"Homer. It's not the end of the world. You know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television."
Marge,"No, it's true, Bart. We used to shoot pool... and go dancing..."
Marge,"And a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk, just like this."
Marge,Whoa--
Marge,Pick one.
Marge,Uh... well....
Marge,"Lisa, I'd rather tell you a different story. How your father and I first met and fell in love."
Marge,"We were seniors in high school, but we had never even met."
Marge,I'm for equal rights. But do we really need a whole amendment?
Marge,Not if I have to do heavy lifting or math.
Marge,"Oh, the shop kids are smoking again."
Marge,"... And in another article, I found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife, who incidentally is not married to a house, would cost forty-eight thousand dollars a year!"
Marge,The first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these... male imposed shackles.
Marge,"Hm, I guess it's the tissue paper inside."
Marge,"Well, no I don't. Actually, I never really..."
Marge,"Excuse me, is this Room 106?"
Marge,I'm a political prisoner. Last time I ever take a stand.
Marge,"I'm sorry, I don't even know your name."
Marge,"""Bringing up a son, even a blind one, isn't a lifetime occupation. Now, the more you help him... the more you hurt him."""
Marge,"Well thank you, Artie."
Marge,Hello.
Marge,"Yes, I remember."
Marge,"Well, I don't think you're my type."
Marge,"Hmm, I don't know."
Marge,I'm sorry.
Marge,"Well, you seem like a nice enough guy, but I really don't have the time."
Marge,And the City Forensics championship is coming up.
Marge,"Oh, and I-I tutor part time."
Marge,Yes.
Marge,Just those who need help with French.
Marge,Why is there make-out music on?
Marge,"Well, not me. Shut it off and let's get down to business."
Marge,Bien.
Marge,Bien.
Marge,"Tres bien. Well, I should probably be going. I have a big Forensics meet tomorrow."
Marge,"Homer, you're amazing. Before you couldn't say bon jour. But now you can conjugate all the regular verbs, two irregular verbs, and sing the first verse of ""Allouette""."
Marge,Yeah!
Marge,Consonants.
Marge,"Merci, I guess."
Marge,"You know, Homer, you're like no one I've ever met before. You're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension."
Marge,Oui.
Marge,Maybe I'll wear my hair... up.
Marge,"You knew the City Forensics finals are tomorrow. And you kept me here until one a.m. pretending to be stupid. Homer J. Simpson, I hate you!"
Marge,Bringing up a son -- even a blind one -- isn't a lifetime occupation. Now the more you help him--
Marge,"Congratulations, Artie."
Marge,"No, Artie, Artie. The best argument is that I've known and respected you for eight years, and I would be delighted to go to the prom with you."
Marge,Couldn't we just use rouge for this?
Marge,Homer!
Marge,What are you doing here?
Marge,I also said I hated you and we haven't even talked since then.
Marge,Homer?
Marge,Why are you doing this? Why can't you accept that I'm here with someone else?
Marge,"I don't know, but it is."
Marge,"Gee, Artie. Artie wait. I don't know. I mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it."
Marge,"Artie, please!"
Marge,"Oh, Artie!"
Marge,"Now, really, I mean it. Now stop it!"
Marge,"Take me home, Artie."
Marge,"Yeah, right."
Marge,Homer.
Marge,"Yeah, you want a ride?"
Marge,"You know Homer, when I got home, I realized who I should have gone to the prom with."
Marge,My prom date.
Marge,Why so glum?
Marge,"Homer, we talked about cable before. Do you really think we can afford it?"
Marge,Are you sure this is legal?
Marge,"""Myth: It's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies. Fact: Most movies shown on cable get two stars or less and are repeated ad nauseam."" Hmm, well, I don't know."
Marge,Ooh. That's a good idea.
Marge,"Aren't you ready for church, Homer?"
Marge,"So, what did you children learn about today?"
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"Bart, you're no longer in Sunday School. Don't swear."
Marge,What's gotten into Lisa?
Marge,What? Whadda ya mean?
Marge,"Oh, of course. It's thou shalt not... uh... covet... graven images... something about covet..."
Marge,Yes. I ate two grapes. Please charge me for them.
Marge,"Just charge me something, please."
Marge,"Well, you know, Bart was looking at that racy movie today, and Lisa's losing a little respect for you... Maybe we should think about unhooking the cable."
Marge,"Well, then maybe you should pay for it."
Marge,"But Homer, I'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home."
Marge,No.
Marge,"Oh, Homer."
Marge,"No, Homer, not over this. No, no."
Marge,"Are you sure you want to do this, Homer? It doesn't look friendly."
Marge,"Thank you, Barney. How many people are coming, Homer?"
Marge,"Lisa, I brought you some lemonade for your protest."
Marge,"Well, don't give up. When you love somebody you have to have faith that in the end they will do the right thing."
Marge,"Here you go, Homie."
Marge,One. And two. And three. And reach. And five. And six. And seven..
Marge,"Homer, remember you promised you'd try to limit pork to six servings a week?"
Marge,Saturday night? I'm not even sure my sisters will be available.
Marge,Well if you have other plans...
Marge,Patty! Selma! We're home.
Marge,Well... I'll try.
Marge,"Homer? Do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the Bowler's Hall of Fame in St. Louis, Missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin?"
Marge,Then you'll also remember that you owe me a favor...
Marge,...to be called up whenever and for whatever reason I desire.
Marge,Not to me.
Marge,I want you to find a husband for my sister Selma.
Marge,She's the one who likes Police Academy movies and Hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days.
Marge,It's Patty who chose the life of celibacy. Selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her.
Marge,"Homer, you will find her a man."
Marge,And not just any man.
Marge,He should be honest... and caring... and well off... and handsome...
Marge,He's here.
Marge,"Well, Selma hated Egypt, too. A camel spit on her."
Marge,"C'mon, Patty. You don't want to show up looking like Yosemite Sam."
Marge,"Well, don't worry. There are still plenty of fish in the sea. Right, Homer?"
Marge,"Homer, my sister is not going out with Barney Gumbel."
Marge,"Very nicely said, Homer."
Marge,"Telephone, Homer."
Marge,It's the hospital.
Marge,Bart!
Marge,"Any luck, Homie?"
Marge,"Well, you want to try that H. Powell?"
Marge,"Bart! Lisa! If you don't behave, we'll turn this car right around and go home."
Marge,"Oh for God's sakes, Homer, it's an empty threat."
Marge,Hello.
Marge,Thank you.
Marge,"Would you like to hold the baby, Herb?"
Marge,"Homer, please."
Marge,"Hmm, well, I met Homer in high school. We got married and had three beautiful children."
Marge,"Actually, I just told you pretty much everything."
Marge,I hope we're not spoiling them.
Marge,"Ohh, dear."
Marge,I really hope we're not spoiling them.
Marge,Now this is spoiling them.
Marge,"Bye, Herb."
Marge,Maybe he just said that to make conversation.
Marge,"Time to get up, Lisa. It's a school day!"
Marge,"Hmmm, Lisa, you don't look well."
Marge,"Ohhh.. my, you're burning up, and your cheeks are so swollen. I think you have the mumps. I'm calling Doctor Hibbert."
Marge,"Well, then, feed him!"
Marge,"Hello, Doctor Hibbert? This is Marge Simpson."
Marge,"Doctor, I think Lisa has the mumps."
Marge,"Mm hm. Two o'clock is fine. Thank you, Dr. Hibbert."
Marge,"Lisa, don't confuse your brother like that. Have a nice day at school, Bart."
Marge,Oh dear.
Marge,I knew it.
Marge,"Well, Lisa, here it is; the Bouvier family quilt."
Marge,"For five generations, women in our family have each added a square to it. Now it's your turn."
Marge,"Oh yes, you do. You just don't know it. The memory of a million drop-stitches flows in your veins."
Marge,You try it.
Marge,You just need to develop a callous. See?
Marge,"You see. Now that's a sewing finger, honey."
Marge,This one's mine.
Marge,"I didn't know then, and I don't know now."
Marge,Those are very elaborate sneakers.
Marge,A hundred and twenty-five dollars!!
Marge,Homer!
Marge,I thought we agreed to consult each other before any major purchases.
Marge,"Well, Homer. There seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here."
Marge,"Oooh, this one looks very reputable."
Marge,"Oh, I don't know, I just dip in and out... I'm only watching today because Brandy is coming out of her coma and she knows the phony prince's body is hidden in the boathouse..."
Marge,"Ohh, that dog!"
Marge,I don't know.
Marge,Hm.
Marge,"Come on, Homer. I want you to see what your sick little girl did."
Marge,"MY QUILT! Six generations, gone."
Marge,"Homer, what are you saying?"
Marge,"No, I'm afraid I agree with your father."
Marge,"Homer, please. It's not just the quilt. He's a nice dog, but he chews up everything. He doesn't obey. He's not even housebroken. And we've spent all this money on an obedience school and I don't see any improvement."
Marge,"Oh, all right. If he passes obedience school, we can keep him."
Marge,"Homer, can't we place this ad after the dog fails his test?"
Marge,"Hmmm, what are you doing, dear?"
Marge,Aww.
Marge,"Well, you certainly captured the moment. Hmmm ."
Marge,"Say goodbye to Grampa, everyone."
Marge,"Homer, that's terrible. We should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly. You know, we'll be old someday."
Marge,"Well, I think we better set an example."
Marge,"Well, I always enjoy the glass blower at Old Springfield Towne."
Marge,"Dad, don't you want to know where we're going?"
Marge,Hello.
Marge,"Homer, are you sure this is the right way? The road seems to have gotten awfully bumpy."
Marge,Homer?
Marge,"Homer, this thing with your Dad has had you moping around the house for days. I think it's time for you to talk to someone who understands."
Marge,"Homer, that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination."
Marge,"No, Maggie! Stay in the shallow end."
Marge,"Now Homer, you do have big bones."
Marge,"Oh, Homer, don't be jealous. I was a schoolgirl, the Beatles were very popular and I had a crush on them."
Marge,"Now, Homer. We've got steamed vegetables and rice cakes for you."
Marge,"Now, they're only thirty-five calories apiece."
Marge,You can put a little something on top for flavor.
Marge,Well...
Marge,But Mr. Schindler...
Marge,I was so upset I decided to send the portrait to the only man on earth whose opinion I could truly trust.
Marge,I never got any. And I never painted again.
Marge,"I think it's a very nice idea. Don't you, Homer?"
Marge,No.
Marge,Apu! What are you doing here?
Marge,Clever title.
Marge,"Oh, Lisa, this was a bad idea."
Marge,Do you really think so? My high school art teacher hated them.
Marge,Then I'm in the class?
Marge,"Well, thank you, Professor Lombardo."
Marge,Really? You're so supportive. I wish every teacher was like you.
Marge,I can't believe it.
Marge,"Okay, shoot."
Marge,"Oh, that's wonderful, isn't it kids?"
Marge,Kids. Remember what I told you about showing a little support.
Marge,Mr. Burns. Would you like to come in?
Marge,"Well, no... just Ringo Starr."
Marge,I don't think that will be a problem.
Marge,"Well, maybe not, but I have the gift of being able to see inner beauty."
Marge,"I'm painting his portrait, Homer."
Marge,"Now, Homer, don't worry. All I need to do is find Mr. Burns' inner beauty."
Marge,"What were you like as a boy, Mr. Burns? Did you have a dog that you loved."
Marge,"Mr. Burns, she's just a baby."
Marge,"Oh, my."
Marge,"I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns."
Marge,Doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?
Marge,"Mr. Burns, it's hard to discover your inner beauty while you're shouting at an eight-year-old girl."
Marge,"That's wonderful Homer, I'm so proud of..."
Marge,"Mr. Burns, I've had enough of your... posing. I can finish the portrait myself."
Marge,"Homer, what are you doing?!"
Marge,Don't you listen to him. He's just a mean little S.O.B.
Marge,I thought there was some good in everybody until I met him.
Marge,I don't think I can.
Marge,I can't make that man beautiful. I'm just not good enough. I guess I'm no artist.
Marge,From the desk of Ringo Starr!
Marge,"Okay, Homer. If you think I can."
Marge,"Umm... Hello. My name is Marge Simpson and I painted this. Maybe you'd like to know what possessed me to do it. Well, I guess I wanted to show that beneath Mr. Burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain, there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of God's creatures."
Marge,I thought I did.
Marge,"Hmmm, I feel that way about your father."
Marge,"Hmmm, I notice little things about your father, too."
Marge,Your father does that to me.
Marge,"Lisa, we can talk, but first you have to accept the fact that I feel that way about your father!"
Marge,"Hmmm, Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and I think you should take her."
Marge,Hmmm huh.
Marge,"Homer, I've been talking to Lisa and I'm concerned about your relationship with her."
Marge,"Homer, please."
Marge,Well... I'll tell you what. Why don't we invite Mr. Bergstrom to dinner?
Marge,Sure.
Marge,Sure.
Marge,No.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,No.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,No.
Marge,Yes.
Marge,"Yo! I'm the coolest puppet in Sockville, and I love strained spinach!"
Marge,"And this dialogue has none of the wit and sparkle of ""Murphy Brown."""
Marge,"Yes, she is. And who are you?"
Marge,"Oh, and Homie, can you come home early from work tomorrow so I can have a girls' night out?"
Marge,It's me!
Marge,I am glad he's gone.
Marge,"Hello, Krusty."
Marge,Crazy Horse!
Marge,What are you doing?
Marge,Why?
Marge,"Um... Mr. Demon, could you come back for my sisters later?"
Marge,"Homer, I don't know you. My wife and your wife are friends. We met just three hours ago."
Marge,"Uh, gee Homer, don't quit..."
Marge,"I keep telling you, ghost sex is nothing. It's worse than nothing."
Marge,Because I'm a ghost!
Marge,That's where you're wrong! Get out on that stage!
Marge,"It's getting less and less likely you're going to yell ""Surprise"" and have all my friends jump out..."
Marge,Apu?
Marge,"Wow -- it's like a renaissance fair, but without all the chubby couples!"
Marge,This is really annoying.
Marge,Maybe I should run this by my husband first.
Marge,"Then ""yes"" -- hither me forth on mine arduous quest!"
Marge,Yes!
Marge,All I see is that rock.
Marge,How did you get in my game? Are you a virus?
Marge,"Wow, Moe -- you're a troll!"
Marge,Who are we hiding from?
Marge,"Hi, Bart! It's your mom! I'm in your videogame with you!"
Marge,"Why Milhouse, don't you look pretty."
Marge,"Bart, are you drinking?!"
Marge,"If they think less of you because of me, then they're not really your minions."
Marge,"Great, I'll come with you. Shouldn't you bundle up? Here, let me enchant your pants."
Marge,"Oh, let's see, should I take the ""Trail of Death,"" or the ""Path of Doom?"" Maybe I should just go back."
Marge,"Thank you, Bart -- this frame grab's going on my coffee cup."
Marge,What a fun quest! Aren't you glad I made you take that nap in the middle?
Marge,I thought all the swords and severed heads were kind of gory so I redecorated using the Hello Kitty expansion pack.
Marge,Bart?! You brought me back to life!
Marge,As best you could.
Marge,You know who else fell? Dr. Hibbert!
Marge,The biggest change for me over the last eight years? That's gotta be Homer!
Marge,Coming right up. Mind if I turn on a little music?
Marge,"I need a full-time job to support Homer, so he has time to work on his rock music, his erotic etchings, his Play-Doh Theater..."
Marge,Hold that thought.
