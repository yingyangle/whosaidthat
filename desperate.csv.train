14337,Susan,the day my mother will need to come and live with me and i won't have a choice.
14833,Susan,"uh, he's my boyfriend, and, and he told me that paul confessed everything to him. oh, and mike has martha's journals, which clearly prove that paul had a motive."
13545,Susan,ring it up.
18307,Susan,"well, i've been in some real marriages that weren't, so--maybe you're right."
17023,Susan,yeah.
14798,Susan,no!
14082,Susan,don't even think about it.
15229,Susan,i didn't get married.
17367,Susan,"well, the first thing off the top of my head--uh--we can't afford it."
14236,Susan,um. bill asked me out.
14574,Susan,no.
13975,Susan,i am so screwed.
15631,Susan,"susan mayer.thank you so much.if my husband had to rescue me, i just, i would have never heard the end of it.he thinks i'm a total klutz."
15565,Susan,"oh, it's nice to meet you."
15368,Susan,that smarts! aah!
16337,Susan,"mike, it wasn't a movie. that was us."
17544,Susan,i had to tell you not to steal a father's precious moment.
16982,Susan,"well, i don't see one."
16410,Susan,"yeah, well, you know, you try to think of a more appropriate ""thank you for saving my life"" gift."
17762,Susan,"well, now you're not."
18024,Susan,"well, yes, i was upset at first. but, you know, mike was gonna be with someone eventually, and i consider myself lucky that it was someone, who, after all is said and done, has always been my true friend."
16974,Susan,wonderful. who did you kill?
13856,Susan,mike.
13444,Susan,"be nice, i come bearing snacks."
14590,Susan,can you give us a minute?
15780,Susan,"yep, scenery's great.so, um, maybe i should unpack.where should i do that?"
16206,Susan,"this is your new lawyer, alan marcus. alan, this is mike delfino."
15234,Susan,karl--
15410,Susan,you're gonna make me take the hit?
17756,Susan,it's gotta be lisa wallace.
18262,Susan,"thanks, but i've reached my maximum allowance for humiliation this week."
15349,Susan,i need you to ditch edie tomorrow night and have dinner with dr. ron and me.
18094,Susan,because i wanted you to give me a good evaluation.
17863,Susan,looks like the mailman switched our mail again. do you have mine?
18236,Susan,"oh, not necessarily. i hear they're getting divorced, and it's gonna get ugly."
14199,Susan,"we heard it on this tape that bree stole from her therapist's office. it's a long story. i'll tell you later. oh, we got to put this in."
17562,Susan,"hey, doc. uh, don't you hand out lollipops to brave little boys?"
14737,Susan,"whoa. no, no no. no, no no, oh. don't, don't, don't. don't, don't, zach, don't run away. wait! come on, just, would you just get back here? come on really, just, let's just talk."
14161,Susan,"well, i also loved junk food, and i gave that up, and i survived."
15247,Susan,i threw it out my car window somewhere on route 7.
17324,Susan,conner.
14757,Susan,"yeah. now that you know he's okay, you should go to him. he'll want to take care of you. that's what parents do. let me help. how much money do you think you'll need to get to utah?"
15180,Susan,"i mean, why not?'cause all my life,i have jumped through hoops to keep men from leaving.but i'm not doing it anymore.so tough luck, pally.you just missed out on a good thing."
15640,Susan,"oh, no, i'm sorry."
15404,Susan,"oh. no,edie,wait.um,no,it's just that--you know,i was married to karl,and i used to--try to surprise him,and he would always,always,always say--""no,susan. don't surprise me.i don't like it."""
18173,Susan,you really think she spent a lot of time thinking about her death?
17013,Susan,"oh, but this isn't the same thing. mike wouldn't lie to me about this."
16147,Susan,"bree, i am so relieved."
14358,Susan,forget it.
15198,Susan,"well, what? i'm desperate here.do you have any other ideas?"
13862,Susan,oh my god!
18398,Susan,i'm not leaving m.j.
15164,Susan,"oh, uh, well, um--uh--"
17765,Susan,"okay. well, have a nice day."
17936,Susan,okay. what kind do you like-- red or white?
17043,Susan,"oh, that's okay. you know, why don't you come back tomorrow to see me, and if julie happens to be here, maybe you can give her some advice on picking out colleges and stuff."
17418,Susan,i told you the brakes were squeaking. i asked you to get them checked.
16631,Susan,"i think so, too. but, you know, then i remember, that's what i thought about me and karl."
16658,Susan,will you marry me?
17898,Susan,i wasn't planning to.
18215,Susan,"hey, katherine, can you call me back as soon as you can? i just left dave, and he's in bad shape. i actually think that he might be--oh, crap. i gotta go."
15866,Susan,"uh, that's my macaroni and cheese. i-i was hoping it would trigger mike's memory. i made it the first time we met two years ago."
15219,Susan,okay.
13936,Susan,i think i'll take my chances--sort of like you did--on those high notes.
18198,Susan,"you know, this whole thing with edie--i mean, seeing her lying in the street that night--oh, it just brought up all those awful memories from our accident."
17118,Susan,"not at all. in--in fact, if you wanna do a dry run for sunday brunch, i'm there for you."
16823,Susan,"hi, gaby. it's me. i'm throwing a party saturday night. guess what kind?"
16260,Susan,"okay, it's me."
15822,Susan,"if we keep this up, we could stay here till christmas."
14513,Susan,we heard rex had a heart attack. how is he?
17347,Susan,we should talk.
17154,Susan,mm. hmm. mm. tim! where's that milk?
14472,Susan,i knew he was good. i just knew it.
17668,Susan,"mmm. oh, pop quiz! why did kim beale stop talking to me in eighth grade?"
16309,Susan,"god, i'm so nervous."
16285,Susan,"the place came out great, huh?"
13453,Susan,"no, it sounds very, very wrong."
17517,Susan,preparing them for what?
13841,Susan,there's your answer.
16067,Susan,i wish. my cooking is not good.
17998,Susan,"no, she's a peach, but she's not the one that dragged me to court to hammer out some custody agreement. now if you'd like, we can go back, and the judge can explain to you the difference between you and your girlfriend."
15377,Susan,"oh,my god!guys,stop it.stop it,right now!"
18240,Susan,"oh, not with karl. by the time he's done finding loopholes and hiding assets, there's nothing left to split."
13473,Susan,tomorrow! i'm in a towel!
17492,Susan,"gaby, we have a problem. i just saw juanita push m.j. down."
17976,Susan,"yes. right. no, wrong."
16615,Susan,gaby--
17405,Susan,i'm sorry. i can't give that to you.
17814,Susan,did we?
17962,Susan,pearls or towel--you decide.
15826,Susan,cigarettes?
16041,Susan,"oh, isn't the master bedroom down that way?"
17006,Susan,"oh, sure. i'll--i'll bring up a tray."
13825,Susan,really? i look okay?
16036,Susan,wow! your timing's perfect.
14628,Susan,"yeah, i know. come on in."
14495,Susan,i wasn't talking about dinner.
15723,Susan,oh.all right.i'll see you tomorrow.
15559,Susan,"i would've never even gone there if i had thought there was a chance with us.you just closed the door so completely,i--ugh,can we just not talk about him?have some more pie.i know you like pie.i know you like me.listen--i'm not asking for us to get back together.i just want us to be friends."
18134,Susan,"okay, i was thinking of stories that put edie in a positive light."
14966,Susan,what do you mean?
17077,Susan,what?
15293,Susan,"oh,it's sort of private."
15233,Susan,but-- we were actually married.
13367,Susan,"i, i thought you were-- um. where were you?"
17285,Susan,"no, no. it's fine, adele. mama."
15494,Susan,"if edie doesn't know,then that means that you just cheated on her with me."
16017,Susan,so you're not gonna move to new york?
15279,Susan,i can't believe you thought i was jealous.it's not like i still have feelings for you anymore.
13771,Susan,here you go. have a nice weekend.
14220,Susan,"no, no, i won't. i don't trust mike anymore. and without trust--no, no. i'm just gonna go in and rip it up and throw it in the trash."
15849,Susan,"yes! yes, i have. almost every day. i can't tell you how much i'm kicking myself for not being here when you woke up."
15981,Susan,"wait, wait, wait, wait! are you kidding?! that's lobster! okay, i thought the restaurant was fantastic, and you were the fussy snob who was impossible to please."
16962,Susan,"how can it be complicated? he's either dead or alive. does it sound complicated to you, michelle?"
17635,Susan,"yeah, i have been married twice, and both times that's imploded, so really, i feel like--love is not my friend. you know, i-i wish that i could say it was just rotten luck, but--i just am thinking that--i can't do this."
14600,Susan,"but i am so happy for you. really, you have a child, and that is good for you."
16480,Susan,"oh, good. i hope the thorns rip him to shreds."
18157,Susan,"well, it depends on what i'm running away from!"
15134,Susan,dr. ron?what are you doing here?
16408,Susan,"well, you don't have to trust mike! you have to trust me, and you don't! that's what going to england's about, isn't it? you're just trying to get me away from mike. well, you know what? screw it. i'm not going. and if you ever bring up his name again, we're over. got it? over!"
15004,Susan,i just want a chance to get to know you.
14922,Susan,"i'm sorry, what?"
13461,Susan,"i could, but she's the one who threw it."
14782,Susan,"yes, and i gave him money and i sent him away and i didn't tell mike."
13871,Susan,here's the candles i borrowed. thanks.
17370,Susan,hey.
16264,Susan,yeah. i'll be having night terrors from now on--which i deserve.
15919,Susan,"of course i came. oh! oh, i just love your house. it always smells like you. oh, my gosh! what, is the thing, is that tonight?"
15552,Susan,"yes,honey!gus the mailman is here!he's using the bathroom.he'll be down in a minute.oh! darn it.guess we'll have to take a rain check,huh?"
18055,Susan,"well, we don't know that for sure. i could have misplaced it."
17056,Susan,yeah. why?
16102,Susan,her teeth were pulled. you don't think that's worth telling the cops she was messing around with a dentist?
15064,Susan,"well, that's great,isn't it?"
17953,Susan,"yeah, well, if we were still married, you'd--probably would've waited until i finished my sentence."
13885,Susan,what if i want to talk about the big crush i have on the plumber that lives across the street?
15770,Susan,ian!
16746,Susan,he said i'm pregnant.
13822,Susan,because he has money. a lot of it.
15628,Susan,but don't cross the street!just tell the neighbor that your mommy's stuck in a big truck!
16569,Susan,"well, then. we'll just be happy."
17653,Susan,"you're just guessing. it's ""panties."""
13317,Susan,"yeah, and then he got this zen look on his face, and he said, you know susan, most men live lives of quiet desperation."
15334,Susan,"aw, thank you."
13484,Susan,it's a date.
17344,Susan,"you gotta help me out here. i'm just trying to protect my child. i don't want him to go through life saddled with the name ""maynard."""
16124,Susan,yesterday.
14594,Susan,"wow. i'm gonna take a cab home, okay?"
18179,Susan,"oh, i think my leg's asleep."
14085,Susan,"i mean, i understand why you would want to have kids, but that chapter of my life is just closed. i don't think i can go back there. and so, you know, given the way i feel and given the way i think you feel--"
13388,Susan,do you wanna have dinner with me?
17749,Susan,gaby thinks that carlos isn't gonna find her attractive after he gets his sight back.
15564,Susan,"thanks, orson.thanks for coming.you know,you didn't have to do this."
18275,Susan,"uh, no. not like that. no, i was thinking that after our quickie courthouse ceremony, you could buy me a cake. i love wedding cake. it's the one part of marriage that never lets you down."
14187,Susan,i don't know.
18377,Susan,"aren't you hungry, though? maybe there's a restaurant up ahead."
14791,Susan,there's no electricity.
13648,Susan,"oh,thank you so much! you're saving my life!!"
15694,Susan,he does.
17986,Susan,"i gotta go. you get lots of rest and drink plenty of fluids, okay?"
14379,Susan,"you're so cute, yeah."
15104,Susan,"oh,sorry."
14708,Susan,"well, i hope it wasn't as ugly as me and karl."
13734,Susan,"no, you give me a break! i did not follow you here, and even if i had followed you here, it's because you've been so secretive about kendra."
14383,Susan,i'm going to handle this once and for all.
18241,Susan,"are you kicking us out, tom?"
15092,Susan,"oh, a couple of weeks ago,um, i heard some noises coming from the basement,like a clanging.and i asked betty about it.she lied right to my face."
15323,Susan,"mmm.maybe it's because i just haven't felt that thunderbolt yet.you know,with mike,it hit me.with karl,it hit me.i didn't have to worry about how i felt because the thunderbolt told me."
17269,Susan,"oh, okay."
13708,Susan,"ooo, love that jacket. good choice."
16582,Susan,is that all you have to say?
14909,Susan,"well, i said it was a good explanation, not a great one."
13525,Susan,"oh, wow. why?"
16879,Susan,"um, i'm susan. i live next door."
13960,Susan,did i come at a bad time?
18154,Susan,"she is annoying, and i hide when she knocks on my door, she does not deserve for you to be wrecking her marriage."
16501,Susan,"can you imagine? i mean, finding out that two men you trusted bet you in a poker game. i mean, how demeaning is that?"
15261,Susan,okay.
17593,Susan,"oh, come on! we were mike and susan, remember? you only get one of those in a lifetime. we could make things right again."
16164,Susan,"ian, please, i just lost one of my best friends. i can't lose you, too."
14107,Susan,"okay, call."
13530,Susan,"oh, you don't have to apologise about carl. really, carl and i are over. i've moved on."
15833,Susan,"oh, it's julie. i have to. hello? what's up? hey. uh, i can't, no, can you say that again? the signal's really bad. what? oh, my god."
18356,Susan,well--i realized that i never properly congratulated you on getting married.
15148,Susan,a what?
17865,Susan,i'm sorry. i thought we gave your latest breakup the three seconds of shock it deserved.
15555,Susan,for keeping edie from smashing my face in.that's the nicest thing anybody ever did for me.
16188,Susan,"uh, it's small. it's got a plaid cover. oh, and when you find it, you have to read it because i promised her that i would always respect her privacy. now help me flip this mattress."
14219,Susan,yes. what if it just a bunch of far-fetched stories.
17087,Susan,are you sure that's all it is?
13645,Susan,excuse me. i think i'm lost.
15569,Susan,"no. no, look,the whole neighborhood turned out to help.i'm very popular."
16371,Susan,deep enough. come on! let's move!
16514,Susan,ugh. i wish she'd hurry. i'm terrified of snakes.
15316,Susan,what do you mean?
17578,Susan,moving in? here?
15147,Susan,"oh,uh,friday's good."
18072,Susan,"well, i mean it. anyone would be lucky to have you. you are a catch. jeez. how did it get so late? is there a school policy on showing up to work drunk?"
14691,Susan,"hi. i'm sorry to interrupt. i knocked, but i guess you guys didn't hear me."
16919,Susan,oh. i just wanted them to like me.
15883,Susan,"ouch, that hurts.um, okay, remember this spot?this is where we sat in your truck and had our first kiss."
14321,Susan,why was she hitting you?
15713,Susan,hi jane.
16115,Susan,"i said i was sorry, ian. i have to help mike. i'm all he's got."
18388,Susan,"okay, listen. it's really important that you win this game. so i want you to find a good hiding place, and even if you hear dave, you don't come out no matter what, okay? okay? don't worry. i'm gonna hide, too. now go. go!"
17508,Susan,i was trying to teach her not to be a bully--something she should have learned from her mother.
15095,Susan,how old do you think i am?
15720,Susan,"all right.well, i am really hungry."
15686,Susan,we're in.
16053,Susan,jane has some beautiful things.
17677,Susan,i thought you were blocked.
13445,Susan,"hello, sorry i'm late."
16671,Susan,what?
16226,Susan,oh. ian--
16062,Susan,your parents? really?
15539,Susan,hi. sorry.i'm just on the lookout for edie.
17786,Susan,that's the worst thing i've ever heard.
14657,Susan,"in five seconds, i'm gonna punch it."
13761,Susan,i could let him in.
14387,Susan,"well, you just threw rocks in her mother's face. how's that for a start?"
18229,Susan,"a few years ago, mike and i got in a car accident. a woman and her daughter--died."
15915,Susan,ah.
18379,Susan,"okay, sweetie. do you mind pulling over at the next rest stop?"
18414,Susan,what?
14041,Susan,i've been so concerned about julie lately that i sort of eavesdropped on her the other day when she was having a phone conversation with zach.
13803,Susan,give me the dress.
16605,Susan,"oh, right! i have to cancel my wedding--again!"
14692,Susan,"well, i have good news. um, i've been taking piano lessons with betty applewhite, and, uh, well, i just thought maybe i could join you guys. you know, like a trio. doesn't that sound fun?"
14026,Susan,"well, i want to know that i am not the only one who is worried about this, and i want to know that if the two of them are over here, that they are going to be supervised, and i really want you to stop looking at me like i'm crazy."
14821,Susan,"he's right, mom. oh, i want it to be just like you do. you know on your own terms and you get down on one knee and the whole production."
15482,Susan,i can't believe you actually want to talk about feelings.you really have changed.
17166,Susan,what the hell is going on here?
16783,Susan,"no, and neither are you."
14526,Susan,great. that's great.
16289,Susan,"absolutely, yes!"
16666,Susan,"fine, we'll skip the chocolate. how out a champagne fountain? oh, i know! maybe we can make the champagne flow through the ice sculpture."
13523,Susan,i love old movies!!
13433,Susan,how's bongo doing?
15634,Susan,"of course not, but when you see it for the first time, i want you to get the whole impact. ta-da!"
16720,Susan,"um,sometimes.but mike's a big spooner.he's like sleeping with a hibachi."
15201,Susan,the surgeon is slicing me open a week from tomorrow.what other choice do i have?
16210,Susan,"with a better lawyer,he could be out in zero.we need to find a lawyer who believes that he's innocent."
13462,Susan,no.
14837,Susan,we need to talk.
16254,Susan,i sure as hell do.
14787,Susan,utah. oh lord. why did i do this?
15058,Susan,"well, that's not what we're saying."
17151,Susan,"oh, of course you do. that's right! this is my cousin timmy. he stayed with us that summer that he went to band camp."
17648,Susan,and knowing we're not gonna have sex takes all the pressure off.
17334,Susan,maynard.
17015,Susan,"i'm thinking that you're a drug addict and a liar, so say something that's not that."
17686,Susan,"oh, not yet. i wanna give her new boyfriend the once-over. wow. he's as cute as she said-- nice smile, and look at that hair. don't you just wanna run your fingers through it?"
16574,Susan,"what? ugh, damn it! stupid mossy trees!"
16094,Susan,mike was arrested for murder.
18291,Susan,"""chip in""? it's is not a birthday cake for shirley in accounting. it's mortgage and food and insurance. i'm sorry, but i can't marry you."
15096,Susan,why don't we get our table?
17657,Susan,seriously?
16944,Susan,why don't you get-- tree house plugs?
14584,Susan,zach said you kidnapped his father so you could kill him.
13552,Susan,i think i'm being blackmailed.
16058,Susan,"okay, well, give me a minute, and i will change into something nice."
15623,Susan,"i mean, that is after i get running water and electricity again--and a coffeemaker."
15039,Susan,"no, i'm not screwing him! he's my father!"
15844,Susan,"okay, not on purpose, but you did. you were sweet and charming and english.and that's why when my prayers were answered,i was a hundred miles away, naked in someone else's arms.this should never have happened."
15739,Susan,"oh, well, it's been a long time since i've been in a mood to, thank you."
17376,Susan,"here's the thing. you and i have always had kind of an unconventional relationship, and the reason that worked was because we always tell each other the truth--until yesterday. julie, i lied about not having enough money to send you."
17937,Susan,i'm not surprised. he was a good man.
18168,Susan,"lynette, don't look at edie."
16326,Susan,"oh, my god! i'm so sorry! are you all right?"
16717,Susan,sorry.
18197,Susan,i know what you meant. i'll stop by tomorrow and see him.
15089,Susan,"well, i told him everything i know,which wasn't much."
14830,Susan,"no, stop! put that pie filling down. slowly. i'm calling nine-one-one."
17525,Susan,"well, did you tell me to take off the lens cap? next time, be more specific."
14770,Susan,"oh, my god. lonnie, did you move some of my money?"
14552,Susan,ouch.
15935,Susan,"hello, carolyn."
13474,Susan,"i'm not really ready for this, i was gonna have a whole speech prepared."
17851,Susan,because--he loves me.
14612,Susan,i live on this street. your daughter lives on this street. i will not have you flaunting your sexcapades in front of us.
15390,Susan,omelettes. you want me to make you one?
16307,Susan,how was the game?
16340,Susan,"actually, no, it was gross. but you were really sweet. you just gave me a lot of kisses and said not to worry, i'd get a lot of chances to make you pancakes 'cause--"
16868,Susan,"oh, my god. and there i was, just bugging you about your doctor. i am so sorry. you should've just told me."
14709,Susan,"i'll be right back."" ""oh, um, i'm just gonna need a couple of seconds, so feel free to pray."
13582,Susan,"you're a piece of work , you know that?"
18400,Susan,what?
14376,Susan,"yeah, i do and that's what makes me so crazy. the difference between you and i, that you could be heartbroken and you can just move on and i am just broken."
16798,Susan,"oh, that must mean you're matt. i'm susan mayer, and i'm--"
17941,Susan,"yeah. he bit his teacher, huh? they had that problem with their older boy, toby. it's a family of biters."
16780,Susan,"okay, i'll come there. are you still mad at me about the party?"
14128,Susan,okay.
13396,Susan,but only i'm going. because you're gonna come down with something semi-serious that requires bed-rest and fluids.
17475,Susan,what are you doing here?
14557,Susan,yeah.
17298,Susan,my water just broke. i'm in labor. we have to go.
18250,Susan,"okay. i just had my car detailed, so i should probably go."
17069,Susan,"orson, we need to talk."
17256,Susan,i know.
17280,Susan,"although he also enjoys coming home to sesame chicken from red panda, and they deliver."
18308,Susan,sweet! let's get to the car wash on our way to the courthouse.
16987,Susan,"because i am carrying a baby that has your genes. if my doctor told me that there was something wrong with this baby--something physical, i could handle that. i would probably even love it more. but if my baby was born without a conscience, without a soul, i don't know what i would do."
13670,Susan,"so, how'd you get the fat lip?"
16629,Susan,oh! well--
16693,Susan,you clean up pretty good yourself.
15625,Susan,"ahh.okay, break times over."
13612,Susan,"now that you've gotten your date, can you tell me what that really mean -that 907a?"
14759,Susan,lonnie. what are you doing here?
17655,Susan,mm. now you tell me something i don't know about you.
15307,Susan,what the hell are you doing?
14327,Susan,morty!
16678,Susan,"okay, seriously, you don't have to kill yourself. i could max out my credit card."
13888,Susan,thanks.
14362,Susan,yeah.
15275,Susan,"how? how are you gonna handle edie?that poor woman's dreams exploded in her face tonight.you know,it's not like you can just go out and buy her flowers,and everything will be better."
17198,Susan,"you know, it's none of my business, but seeing as i have seen you naked twice in the last week, i think i can ask, is something bothering you?"
16066,Susan,"okay, i guess it's time we have the conversation. ian, haven't you ever wondered why i've never cooked for you?"
17374,Susan,"well-- we all lie to our kids sometimes, right?"
13917,Susan,"what? i loathe karl, and the postman will back me up on that, too."
17876,Susan,todd shaffer. i was 14.
16375,Susan,"if you stay here, you'll definitely drown. you see how my plan is better?"
13768,Susan,i don't know.
14994,Susan,"it's not like i want an invitation to thanksgiving. i just wanna have coffee, or a lunch now and then."
13468,Susan,"i left three messages. oh, he's not gonna come. big surprise. i did everything but foam at the mouth. god, i hate when i get that way. it's like every time i get within 10 feet of karl, i just become this monster."
17061,Susan,victor knows?
17417,Susan,"yeah, he's upstairs waiting for you."
14444,Susan,"oh god, really?"
16652,Susan,"listen.we need to talk. i spoke to mike, and, uh, he's just not really into the whole double wedding thing."
16070,Susan,"okay, i'll give it a shot."
14672,Susan,you walked out on me.
15228,Susan,yeah.
15697,Susan,but i like doing it.i think mike would want me to.oops.
17736,Susan,"oh, i shouldn't. they're yours."
16400,Susan,"not mine, okay? that way, we can use it when we visit."
18110,Susan,"what a lovely rainbow, june. here's a gold star for you. oh, drew, wow! you know, elephants don't have wings, but i like the way you're thinking. hey, evan, what did you draw? that's a lot of red."
14911,Susan,"oh, now i feel really awful."
13591,Susan,mr. whiskers!!!
14840,Susan,"well, right. i mean, there's that."
15222,Susan,"oh, yes. no, no,i do need insurance.i just don't have cancer.i have a-- wandering spleen."
17181,Susan,imposing? who's imposing? you can stay as long as you want.
17682,Susan,"i can't believe i ever thought you didn't know me. well, i guess i should let you finish this. i'm sort of missing hands."
17835,Susan,oh! knock yourself out.
14335,Susan,**sigh**
13384,Susan,mike!
13315,Susan,sorry i'm late.
15633,Susan,"oh, she is and we're gonna be so happy here. look at your new home."
13513,Susan,"well, she's bringing out the big guns."
15651,Susan,"oh, did i say that?"
14369,Susan,mother!
15913,Susan,don't worry. it won't last. you're just fooling yourselves!
16721,Susan,"okay,whoa.i'm gonna stop you right there.i am way too young for that.please refer to your chart."
14683,Susan,"it was the early eighties. well, i'm not gonna argue with you. you want to do the show with edie, and i think that's super. so she's really good, huh?"
17258,Susan,"yeah, but that doesn't mean you have to go blurting all our deepest, darkest secrets."
13340,Susan,"oh, that're right."
13872,Susan,"i cannot believe that after everything you did, you're mad at me."
16137,Susan,"take care of yourself, mike."
17081,Susan,forget it.
15308,Susan,i am not!
16510,Susan,"yeah, only i didn't know edie was gonna have the party in a park. what if gaby see us?"
16691,Susan,"oh, you might wanna check that breast pocket of your suit."
18184,Susan,"okay. i want to do edie justice, and for that to happen, i need four words, okay?"
18353,Susan,"good. that's all i needed to hear. well, i hope that you will be very happy together."
15232,Susan,what?
16451,Susan,don't say that.
14449,Susan,"i can't trust mike, and i wanted to find out what really happened. from a source that doesn't have an agenda. now open it up."
13370,Susan,"alright ladies, lift 'em up. to mary alice, good friend and neighbor. wherever you are, we hope you've found peace."
13374,Susan,"oh mary alice, what did you do?"
17257,Susan,did you have to tell karl about rehab?
16065,Susan,"right. so, um, do you want me to make reservations at that little french place?"
15821,Susan,"okay, here's one--julie needs to spend more time bonding with her father."
14835,Susan,"mike, paul young is back. look."
15351,Susan,"okay,will you shut up?it's not funny. i was drugged."
16168,Susan,yeah? so?
14749,Susan,"i don't know. he, he disappeared."
17485,Susan,"you know what, boys? not in the house. oh, my god!"
14923,Susan,"no, edie. i mean, this is so unexpected on so many levels. i don't know what to say."
14496,Susan,"no, no, i got it. um, i got it. so, if you've got a plumbing emergency, shouldn't you get going?"
13865,Susan,"oh, i'm sorry, are you okay?"
17248,Susan,"there's nothing wrong with that. it shows our respect for lamaze, and, you know, the whole birthing process."
14977,Susan,"why, cause i went to college?"
16861,Susan,"okay, back to charades."
17232,Susan,"well, that's not enough. he should pay for what he did. he should go to prison."
17001,Susan,ice cream. sorry.
14906,Susan,"oh, uh, julie, uh oh, julie, uh--"
18368,Susan,"oh, it's your daddy. hey, mike."
17505,Susan,"i'm sorry. juanita, i just wanted you to see how it felt. are you okay?"
15015,Susan,you haven't even finished your coffee.
16297,Susan,what's the rush? am i pregnant?
14279,Susan,yes! mike served time for selling drugs and manslaughter
17823,Susan,come on.
15948,Susan,and you just tell me this now?
15502,Susan,like an angel.
17244,Susan,what does that mean?
14625,Susan,the one at the piano bar?
17246,Susan,the only work i've had done was getting 185 pounds of ugly fat sucked out of my house.
13528,Susan,i don't know that people really say that anymore.
17516,Susan,"well, we split up, so it's at least half my fault any way you slice it."
14635,Susan,"uh, well, i, i don't, i don't think there's anything wrong with us seeing a movie once in awhile."
13592,Susan,actually i do have a question. do you have a second?
14271,Susan,what happened?
14372,Susan,"tim, can you just stay out of this?"
14968,Susan,i just want to see what he's like. and satisfy my curiosity and get it out of my system.
14115,Susan,"well, i'm adorable crazy, and he's rampage crazy."
14204,Susan,"mike, it's not a good time. i'm a little drunk and a little freaked out."
18129,Susan,yeah.
14581,Susan,"well, you should care more about me. i'm your girlfriend. we're moving in together. he's just a neighbor. you don't even know zach."
14174,Susan,wow.
15105,Susan,right. right.
15783,Susan,yeah.and i think i have yours.
16052,Susan,but--
15600,Susan,"hey.you know,i am not even tired.so-- why don't i stay up and help you?"
16299,Susan,"mike, what are you doing here?"
13995,Susan,"i know, i know. mrs. huber was a good friend to you."
14210,Susan,"every time we went out for pizza, you could have said, ""oh, and by the way, i once killed a man."" or when you said, ""hey, let's go jogging,"" you could have said, ""well, by the way, i once killed a man."" every time we went to the movies and the hero shot the bad guy, you could have turned to me and said, ""oh, and by the way, i did that once."" you didn't."
14368,Susan,you've been married four times.
16594,Susan,"hi, curt. susan mayer. you did my wedding invitations? uh, i'm gonna need another batch. exactly the same, only change the name ian hainsworth to mike delfino. long story. call me."
16669,Susan,"okay, i know that you think i'm being silly, but all of our friends went to bree's wedding, and now they're going to gaby's. two months from now, do we really want them thinking our wasn't as nice?"
15254,Susan,great!i'll have a light lunch.
16853,Susan,"honey, i love you, but i wanna win."
15773,Susan,hmm? so what are you really doing here?
17240,Susan,my god.
17265,Susan,"uh, yeah. that guy was the worst."
15379,Susan,"oh,ron!oh! ugh!what the hell is wrong with you?"
13970,Susan,"i, i'm sorry for what happened. it must be really hard, not knowing who did it, or why. you must feel helpless."
18167,Susan,i can't help thinking about all the times edie and i sniped at each other. we could have been good friends.
18093,Susan,"that is not true, and i think we are dangerously close to no longer speaking in metaphor."
15537,Susan,what if i can't?
13491,Susan,"okay, i gotta break the ice here. so you're in counselling, big deal. you want humiliation? i'll give you humiliation. i locked myself out of my house stark naked and got caught by mike."
18214,Susan,"all right. i will be back after work to check on you. but until then, here's the phone, in case you wanna order chinese or--call a hotline or something."
17464,Susan,i am-- so sorry. miss? um-- could you just--please take good care of my friend?
14546,Susan,"look, zach. i know you're upset. let's just, let's just sit down and talk."
18130,Susan,"i used to hope that one day, you would know what this feel like, and now that you do--i'm so sorry."
16449,Susan,great.
18106,Susan,"and now i'm ignoring you and moving on to evan. hello, evan."
13732,Susan,"what? no, no, i just came here, you know, with edie. we, just, love to ride that bull."
16814,Susan,"you know, this perfect teenager thing is really starting to chap my ass."
14028,Susan,so you're moving! we're all going to miss you.
16787,Susan,wait for it. wait for it. ta-da.
17987,Susan,"oh, i know, honey. but mommy has a job now. come on. we talked about this. you understand, right? don't be sad. i am gonna pick you both up at 6:00."
17317,Susan,apology accepted. let's go. aah!
17171,Susan,"what do you have to reminisce about? he was here for a week when he was 16. what could you two have even--oh, my god, you slept together."
15086,Susan,"oh, my god!"
13443,Susan,"oh mary alice, what did you do?"
17955,Susan,"uh, what am i looking at exactly?"
14349,Susan,"oh uh, that's okay. i just didn't expect to see anyone up at a quarter of one."
18371,Susan,okay.
13480,Susan,you know what? i don't need an apology. i don't need anything from you.
17930,Susan,"as long as you're here, i think there's a loose shingle on my roof. do you think maybe you could fix it for me?"
14484,Susan,"um, i say, oh! hold that thought. edie, edie stop! stop! hang on."
14183,Susan,paul and mary alice had a baby that died.
14651,Susan,"honestly, edie, i don't mind. you can skate off into the sunset with karl. be my guest."
18435,Susan,"shh. not in front of mike! oh, look, mike. ian brought you flowers. i'll just go put them in some water."
17771,Susan,"hello? it's me. i just wanted to tell you--i've been thinking about it, and, um, i'm okay with you dating mike."
14065,Susan,ooh. valentine's day card. it's pretty.
14700,Susan,"yep, i am. i think i'm going to make another push for using that pedal. i think it adds grandeur."
16933,Susan,"yes. quiet art is subjective. but you see, mike is working really long hours lately, and he can't s sleep with all that noise."
17394,Susan,edie? is that really you?
15420,Susan,"okay,now remember,i'm broke."
15955,Susan,"i'm sorry. i know, julie picked a lousy time to rebel. i just can't fly off and ignore it."
14140,Susan,no.
17847,Susan,oh! so--nothing happened between us?
15320,Susan,because he's a gem.and apparently he loves me.
15318,Susan,"oh,yeah,i'll be surprised.so i guess we have the whole insurance thing worked out."
18145,Susan,"okay, i lied. i hate running."
15321,Susan,"lynette,he is everything i could possibly want in a boyfriend,and i just don't know if i feel that--spark."
18053,Susan,"no, we've already covered you."
17386,Susan,"i knew wayne was the reason she moved away, and the second she moved back, he started stalking her again."
17532,Susan,"so you're still gonna wanna hang out with us, even when you're totally fabulous, and we're still nobodies?"
18346,Susan,"well, don't be mad at katherine. we all know that she just can't-- keep a secret."
14518,Susan,"i thought the whole point of having a cell phone was so someone could reach you when they needed to talk. how can we move forward as a couple if you won't communicate with me? mike, i need you to call me back! i mean it! love you. bye."
17253,Susan,"hey, guys. mike, you remember karl? and this is karl's wife marisa."
18030,Susan,i painted it. it was a gift for him.
14250,Susan,"thank you. i know, i'm going to. it's on the top of my list."
16433,Susan,"hi, ian. i just asked mike. he can't make it."
13389,Susan,"heh, well, and julie. uh, it's a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighbourhood, we invite them over for a home-cooked meal. sort of a tradition."
17783,Susan,what did happen?
15841,Susan,i'll pick up my bags later.
14980,Susan,"yeah. they're just like mine. they're, they're nice."
15041,Susan,"oh, no."
13426,Susan,"uh, yes, yes he was."
15018,Susan,"actually, it was--fine."
15266,Susan,"well,karl is a lawyer,and it could just be a prenup for another client."
14182,Susan,"i'm telling you, he's hiding something. he clams up every time we try to ask him about mary alice. and then when we found out about dana--"
14962,Susan,"are you saying that all this time my father has been alive, and just right across town running the supply and feed store?"
14820,Susan,"yeah, it did."
17789,Susan,the whole thing's like a miracle.
15926,Susan,oh. did you stay here all night?
17918,Susan,"oh, well, on one hand, i got dumped for a pair of headlights named brandy. on the other, i reported karl's credit cards stolen, and cut the pockets out of all of his pants. so a little from column ""a,"" a little from column ""b."" sorry."
13718,Susan,paul young's garage sale.
16389,Susan,all right. we won't talk about it. want some cheese?
14893,Susan,"actually, i'm trying to keep a positive outlook on the whole thing. um, last night i started writing and, well, i think there's a book in there."
17511,Susan,i came to say i'm sorry.
16829,Susan,hey. what's this?
14758,Susan,you should find your father first. let me help.
13390,Susan,well. i order takeout.
17184,Susan,"orson, you scared me. why are you sitting down here in the dark? and aren't you a little cold?"
17064,Susan,"wow. tape, batteries, a radio. how'd you know i need this stuff?"
16439,Susan,"well, are you free for dinner tomorrow?"
13993,Susan,"oh, of course, take your time."
17921,Susan,what--do--you--know?
13745,Susan,thanks.
17654,Susan,"although some days it's ""larva"" or ""chunks."""
16901,Susan,"leave him with me. i need to score some points with those guys, and being a dog-rescuing hero could be just the ticket."
15610,Susan,no!give it! no!
17091,Susan,yeah.
17502,Susan,never mind. what did you do to m.j.?
14257,Susan,"i mean obviously i am not going to read the letter. at some point you just gotta let it go, right?"
16967,Susan,"do you see him? i mean, do you have a relationship with him?"
17450,Susan,nice.
14212,Susan,the police showed me your rap sheet!you killed the man!
15658,Susan,welcome to the neighborhood.
14091,Susan,"oh, okay. thanks."
16725,Susan,"yeah,get used to it."
17770,Susan,what am i supposed to do?
16707,Susan,how's your aunt?katherine used to live here with mrs.sims.
13415,Susan,"yeah, well, if edie's gonna be there, i'm gonna need emotional support."
16287,Susan,i heard you talking to carlos. now answer the question.
14907,Susan,"okay, there is a good explanation for what happened."
13689,Susan,"hi, i'm susan mayer. i have an appointment to see dr. sicher."
18031,Susan,"yeah. it was a little beach we went to for our honeymoon. uh, i mean, you know how much mike loves the ocean."
13411,Susan,i can only imagine. not knowing why mary alice?
13906,Susan,"karl, do you want to join us?"
16073,Susan,"well, that's the thing. uh, so i was hoping, you know, if you're not too busy--"
15599,Susan,"okay, what are you talking about?"
16763,Susan,"you know, the one that you left so suddenly for."
16921,Susan,"i know. uh, maybe if i"
17981,Susan,"m.j., why aren't you dressed? we're gonna be late for our first day of school."
18279,Susan,"ah, fake marriages--they're complicated."
17831,Susan,"well--i wanna be with him, so--i think i have to."
15538,Susan,who is it?
15154,Susan,"uh, yeah, yeah,thursday's great."
17017,Susan,"well, if you did, you wouldn't be doing this! i mean, my god, mike, we have a baby on the way!"
15813,Susan,"don't judge me, mr. virgin--plus one!"
16402,Susan,what happened?
16013,Susan,sixteen years of being perfect. you were due.
18182,Susan,just one word. this is hard.
16687,Susan,you were great.
15689,Susan,"no, he was going to, but then you clocked him in the mouth with a salad shooter, remember? actually, i'm going to pop the question to him tomorrow night."
18108,Susan,"listen, it's bad enough that i've got one ex-husband running around the halls. i don't need the faculty and the parents knowing that i have two. so not a word about us having been married. no more wisecracks. no susie q's. i am miss susan, art teacher."
18101,Susan,my boots.
15978,Susan,wait. julie's gonna know we came home early from the restaurant to check up on her. i don't want her to think i'm overprotective and clingy.
15544,Susan,"and you know why? because we're all so busy and detached from each other.you're at my house every day,and sure,we wave and we say hello,but we barely even know each other.how long have you been delivering my mail,for god's sake?"
14652,Susan,"actually, i'm glad that you shared that, because here's a tidbit for you. karl said he's still in love with me."
14053,Susan,what?
14809,Susan,"oh, my god!"
14848,Susan,"no. no, i didn't. sorry i can't help you out."
15990,Susan,"yes, and you will be poorly educated, and you won't get into college, and you will work for minimum wage for the rest of your life, all because of that boy! i hope you're happy!"
14905,Susan,oh. julie! i thought you were going straight to school.
13775,Susan,"bongo? oh, oh! don't do that! bongo!"
15825,Susan,i love this music. what's it about?
13809,Susan,"no, it's just when i was your age, my pen pal lived on a farm in ohio, not in a mental institution. you know, that letter is one notch above prison mail."
13895,Susan,for you? of course it is.
17377,Susan,because i just freaked out about you leaving.
14098,Susan,i'm so sorry.
14843,Susan,"oh. i forgot about that. i just can't believe it. i mean, there he is, a murderer, just living right on our street, and there's nothing we can do about it because you're a convicted felon and i burned down that stupid house. it's unfair."
14290,Susan,"alright, maybe you just feel that way because every year you get older and older."
14522,Susan,"well, i'm really sorry for that last message. i was just, uh--"
17182,Susan,especially when you get your big moment in the spotlight. bree gets to present an award to somebody who's done something extraordinary for the community.
16985,Susan,"i don't know. it just bothers me. i mean-- my god, mike. he's your dad."
18283,Susan,monday.
16938,Susan,"i would love to, but--"
17349,Susan,what are those?
15682,Susan,of course.okay.you don't even wanna know what my answer would have been?
13988,Susan,why would you think i was lying?
14901,Susan,why would you--?
16278,Susan,do you know something?
16727,Susan,"i know.and you thought you married a vibrant woman in her prime,and instead,you got a wife who's.dry and dusty."
13504,Susan,thank you.
18321,Susan,what are you doing? i just told you i can't go.
18277,Susan,"okay. yeah, i guess that could be fun. while our friends are toasting to our everlasting happiness, we can yell, ""surprise! it's all a sham! thanks for the crock-pot!"""
17250,Susan,"cause i knew you'd make us switch to another class. last time i was here, karl kept throwing his perfect life in my face, and i just wanted to come back here and--"
17490,Susan,"that is sexi. if feminism means anything, it's that it's okay for a big, mean girl to get her butt kicked. you, teach him one of those brazilian kung fu cha-cha things."
14699,Susan,"no, it's okay, honey. who do you want to be with you in the family talent show?"
13843,Susan,"paul, my daughter doesn't lie."
13537,Susan,mrs huber .
15498,Susan,really?did he say who it was?
13364,Susan,oh..
16663,Susan,"oh, wow!"
14377,Susan,"no, mom, i'm not sad. and i'm not crabby. i'm devastated. and you keep acting like all i need is a couple of aspirin. morty was just one guy in a series of guys for you. and mike? he was the one. why don't you get that?"
16958,Susan,"okay. my aunt ella has arthritis. i have two cousins with webbed feet, and there's a whole lot of third nipples on my dad's side."
17600,Susan,unless you're not interested.
15211,Susan,"oh. oh,so by marrying me--"
14106,Susan,"i'm saying that is about as likely as mike having done it. he's a good guy. i know him. i mean, he's, he's mike."
15671,Susan,"uh, mike, about that ring--"
18139,Susan,you're right. i'm homeless. susan mayer. oh. it's all cleared up.
13467,Susan,"no, but god, you should've seen the look on his face."
14011,Susan,"well, edie, i, i have to clean up."
17760,Susan,it's fine. it's--fine.
18188,Susan,"i'm in the classroom all day, and i have meetings after."
17846,Susan,"lee, um--well, there's just no graceful way to ask this, so--i'm just gonna say it straight out. when you spent the night, did we get it on?"
13345,Susan,edie. what are you--?
16265,Susan,i'm so sorry i ruined jane's funeral.
17019,Susan,me feel guilty?
14100,Susan,"what, what does this mean?"
14227,Susan,lunch?
15570,Susan,"oh, no, no.everybody's been very helpful.um, everybody likes me.absolutely--"
15386,Susan,oh?i need to take this.
14430,Susan,are you crazy? it's one o'clock in the morning. she's sleeping.
14888,Susan,did she cheat?
15669,Susan,"to be fair, you just had a spare room, and this is a whole house."
14751,Susan,"zach, you know what i think? i think you should come back with me."
14388,Susan,you're welcome.
13972,Susan,"oh. so, she must have written a lot of things in them?"
17566,Susan,i've never seen bree so happy. she's glowing.
16810,Susan,"please. every time you and mike disagree on something, you give me the look--that pitiful face that says if i don't back you up, i love the other one more."
13679,Susan,"it's going, finally. we have our first official date next week. i think he's taking me to see a play or something."
15278,Susan,"no,of course not.well,okay,this is good because--you know,if this experience helped you to realize your true feelings,then,uh--then we did something good here."
16525,Susan,deal.
13632,Susan,you couldn't get any more out of him?
13996,Susan,me?
16051,Susan,"okay, you know, that is for ian to decide."
15218,Susan,hi.
13976,Susan,everything about the fire and the measuring cup is gonna be in that journal. everyone is gonna think i'm an arsonist.
16706,Susan,i cannot believe it has been 12 years.you haven't changed a bit.
15114,Susan,he needs to see me or he wants to see me?
17855,Susan,i'm not good alone. i need a man in my life.
13456,Susan,what cabin?
16483,Susan,what?
17943,Susan,"i've been too pushy. oh, please don't take it out on m.j.. he is such a bright kid. say something in spanish."
15088,Susan,"so i swerved to avoid hitting his car,and i hit this parked car instead,and that's when the trunk popped open,and when we got out, we found this dead body and--"
13978,Susan,are you high? edie hates me.
14481,Susan,and that was your cue to come over and flirt? you wasted your time and your doughnuts.
13355,Susan,"oh. mrs. huber, how you doing?"
14979,Susan,"oh, no. i was just looking at the color of your eyes."
13789,Susan,"well, every little detail is one thing. you know, weird creepy secrets, that's another."
18397,Susan,"mike should be here any minute. dave, please. don't hurt mike. it wasn't his fault."
17388,Susan,mike.
17266,Susan,i know. i just wish i could fast-forward through my life and see that everything ends up okay.
18014,Susan,"yeah, 'cause you make it like disneyland over here, with your paninis and your blackjack. you're trying to do everything you can to make him think that you're the other mommy."
14814,Susan,hi. we're just going to a funeral.
18100,Susan,"well, okay, it's not, because i'm alone but i'm not lonely 'cause i have friends. love doesn't happen for everyone. you know what? i don't even know if it's gonna happen for me anymore. but my friends are there for me no matter what, and that helps. so at the very least, you know, let me be there for you--as a friend."
14819,Susan,you can?
17065,Susan,"hey, actually, um, since you're here, i was thinking that maybe it would be a good idea to tell orson about mike's, you know--drug problem."
13382,Susan,the measuring cup?
17300,Susan,"no, no, no, you should take a cab home and start packing. this one feels like a crier."
17920,Susan,brandy's not a redhead. she's blonde.
15519,Susan,"yeah,i kind of figured that."
15609,Susan,bite me!
15441,Susan,that the wedding's off.
17763,Susan,bree?
17138,Susan,i told them you weren't into jam.
17764,Susan,so bree knew?
16585,Susan,"yes, i did, because i am a thoughtful person. and whenever we do get married, that is something you are gonna have to work on."
17072,Susan,"oh, of course, and you know all about shoulder pain--being a dentist."
17813,Susan,we've never looked each other in the eye and said that there is no chance we are ever getting back together.
17997,Susan,"hey, thanks. let me remind you that the reason i agreed to custody is so our son could spend time with his father."
16929,Susan,come on. it's 6:00 a.m. what is that?
13477,Susan,what does that mean?
14797,Susan,can't.
17830,Susan,and he wants me to move there with him.
13982,Susan,"okay, here's the deal, edie. i, i -"
15298,Susan,so?
14463,Susan,you see the thing is. this is probably the last chance for me to find out if i can be with the man i love.
14794,Susan,please don't lie. just tell me.
16766,Susan,is it about matt's party?
15119,Susan,"let's just say if i was a senior in high school,i'd be saying,""wow,you're a hot fifth grader."""
15310,Susan,"oh,no. no,no.no,no,nurse hisel.ow,ow,ow,ow!"
13773,Susan,"if you came in here to judge me, you can just leave!"
16082,Susan,is edie getting you a good lawyer?
14317,Susan,"hey, millie, hi, morty."
13782,Susan,"thank you, oh, you have no idea what that was like--"
13385,Susan,"i didn't realize anyone was gonna be out here, i just sorta rolled outta bed."
17727,Susan,jackson. thank god. where's mike?
14132,Susan,are you sure?
14097,Susan,what's wrong?
16960,Susan,'cause that's what you told me when we first started dating.
13565,Susan,you'd better go get that.
16852,Susan,carlos.
16327,Susan,let me get you a towel.
15434,Susan,karl!
13567,Susan,"uh, yeah. um. julie and i are just out tossing the frisbee around and it flew off into mrs. huber's back yard."
16027,Susan,"well, of course."
15530,Susan,i know that this looks bad--
17973,Susan,"okay, maybe i jumped to conclusions, but this school is important for m.j.. i feel really bad that we're falling short."
15343,Susan,only in the legal sense.and i just didn't tell you because i wanted to protect you.
15040,Susan,"i'm so sorry. i thought you should know, but he didn't want to tell you."
14694,Susan,"well, what makes you so sure i don't have talent?"
16497,Susan,"look, whatever that court report says, i do not have anger issues. i was just having a bad day."
13939,Susan,"yeah, that part when you slept with your secretary was really exciting."
13733,Susan,"yeah, yeah, it's a real rush."
14505,Susan,"oh my god, wow, um, okay oh, wow um, bye."
17567,Susan,"yeah, just until you can blink both eyes at the same time."
15804,Susan,"okay, just so you know eleven is not a lot for a woman my age."
16455,Susan,themes?
13940,Susan,what?
16844,Susan,"gaby! sorry i'm late. oh, my god! you made it. that is such a beautiful dress. we're gonna have so much fun. you--come with me."
13511,Susan,you've got to be kidding me! she washed her car yesterday.
16250,Susan,sold.
15354,Susan,"because i panicked,okay?dr. ron hadn't come into see me since the operation and i was feeling insecure and--yes,go ahead.you may resume laughing."
15579,Susan,what? you just confessed.
17355,Susan,get out.
14543,Susan,"listen, i know you're upset, but is this really what you think your mother would want you doing?"
16528,Susan,where are you going?
18428,Susan,what the hell was that?
16660,Susan,"oh, i have an idea. i just got a lipstick yesterday. you could wear that."
17524,Susan,did i not say 7:00? you missed their little show. m.j. was tooth decay.
17664,Susan,"we are not having sex until date number four, and this is date number two."
17569,Susan,"har har. uh, actually, he's at juanita's watching a dvd. do you want me to call him?"
18158,Susan,a cup? are you sure that'll be enough?
14118,Susan,what day was that?
13880,Susan,yeah.
17793,Susan,who did you sell the ball to?
15342,Susan,"okay, yes,i did remarry my ex,but it was only because he has great health insurance.did miss blabbermouth tell you that, too?"
15150,Susan,thank you.i had a fabulous time.
15989,Susan,"well, then you won't go to school. i'll home school you."
13816,Susan,how can you call something like this harmless? after everything you know about what i went through with karl?
17880,Susan,ron. dr. ron. are we done?
13908,Susan,hold on a sec.
15507,Susan,"oh.well, um, why don't we get you out of here?let's go see a feel-good movie."
14711,Susan,"well, like i said, i'm sorry. i wish it could be you up there."
14934,Susan,"oh, uh. so what have you been doing lately?"
15975,Susan,"we are. we're just gonna miss you, that's all."
17504,Susan,"oh, really? you don't think it would hurt?"
14334,Susan,"you don't have to sell me. go, just go talk to her. now."
16174,Susan,"oh! i was just, uh--i lost an earring."
13676,Susan,just for a couple of hours.
14834,Susan,"uh, he's, follow me."
14721,Susan,"mike, wait!"
18123,Susan,"okay, just so you know, should be bringing this to the psychologist. but i didn't, because this kind of ""self-expression"" usually gets a kid expelled."
16055,Susan,"no, please, listen--the last couple of months, i thought we've gotten really close, and i have been loving that. i just feel like lately--there's this limit to how far you'll let me in."
14576,Susan,edie!
16277,Susan,"i know we've been fighting. something like this happens, it just puts everything into perspective. i am so sorry. it was all my fault. if i hadn't got so caught up in protecting mike--"
17809,Susan,i can totally explain this. i swear.
18244,Susan,"how's it feeling, mrs. mccluskey?"
18433,Susan,that's my daughter.get dressed!
14399,Susan,"aside from you nearly blinding me. several weeks ago you freaked out in my house: you screamed, you threw furniture around."
15741,Susan,"oh, oh, wow. oh, is this going to be awkward?"
18189,Susan,hot shirtless gardeners with great abs and learner's permits?
18081,Susan,"i don't have cumin, but i probably have cinnamon."
13868,Susan,"listen, if paul sees zach and freaks out--"
15727,Susan,it's okay with you if i go out with him?
17242,Susan,"okay, i get it."
17010,Susan,i knew it. i'm so happy.
15484,Susan,are you getting juice for her?
17716,Susan,"lloyd, i'm sorry. i can't help i i don't want my daughter to be someone's fourth wife."
18039,Susan,"uh, look at what i found-- my beach painting."
13987,Susan,i just know mrs. huber's death's been hard on you. i want to help.
17080,Susan,"you might think you have things under control, but they're only gonna get worse--and with a baby on the way."
17461,Susan,where is he?
14088,Susan,what?
13738,Susan,"everybody's looking at me, aren't they?"
15050,Susan,sweet.
15352,Susan,i lied and i told himi didn't know a mike.
15953,Susan,i am so disappointed in you.
14037,Susan,paul.
15037,Susan,"no, wait! wait! it's not what you think!"
16172,Susan,"well--don't--don't think that you can get out of this, you know, by just--oh, god. oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah, right--right there. oh, right there."
17889,Susan,really?
14781,Susan,"last week, when mike and i went to the park searching for zach, i sort of found him."
18069,Susan,he decided to shack up with my best friend. and people wonder why i'm through with men.
13802,Susan,you just told me everything i need to know.
18278,Susan,can't i at least tell the girls?
15054,Susan,i'll wait for your call.
16843,Susan,"a friend of mine recommended this place. it's not exactly what i expected. must be one heck of a doctor, though, huh?"
18429,Susan,"hi. hi, yeah, i'm here."
18127,Susan,so she just left?
18026,Susan,"washed, cleaned, ready to go."
17245,Susan,"okay, clearly, this is not going to work. so why don't you take your child bride and find another class?"
13798,Susan,"no, it's not! so you got addicted to your kids' add medication. it happens."
17528,Susan,"because--mike and i are divorced, so that's why--it was supposed to be a picture of the family, so you should've put your daddy in it."
14061,Susan,"well, whatever it was, that boy is seriously disturbed, and i've forbidden julie from hanging out with him."
17597,Susan,"so just to be clear, you're saying you don't want a relationship?"
15474,Susan,karl. what's going on?
13754,Susan,six is good.
16920,Susan,there must be some way i can apologize to them.
14985,Susan,"mr. prudy, i'm sorry. i didn't want to spring it on you like this. where are you going? you see when i found out you were alive, and, and that we both lived in the same city, i just wanted to meet you."
18238,Susan,my ex-husband.
14603,Susan,"no, not really. i mean, what do we actually know about our neighbors? i mean, we can tell if they keep their lawns nice or they take their trash cans in, but when they do those things, we stop asking questions 'cause if people are good neighbors--"
13652,Susan,yeah.
16785,Susan,do you wanna go or not?
13781,Susan,"i don't think so, either."
16310,Susan,"oh, thanks. i needed to hear to that."
14673,Susan,"it's karl's weekend to have julie, and they're always back by six. that's our custody agreement, back by six, and it's after six."
17935,Susan,great. i will go to the store right now and get some wine so we can toast your retirement.
16145,Susan,"right. sorry. uh, i'm just new to this whole snitch thing. hold on, okay?"
18276,Susan,what?
13861,Susan,mike?
18425,Susan,"well, i went over mike's to feed the dog."
17221,Susan,"no, i get it. really, i knew this day was coming. i just didn't know it would be a day when i was so horny."
17275,Susan,"a fount of wisdom, your meemaw. well--i really appreciate this. thanks, adele."
13930,Susan,only when i'm alone.
15212,Susan,"uh, likewise."
14299,Susan,the rules are simple. we play for cash. the dealer picks the game and unsubstantiated gossip is encouraged.
18048,Susan,"uh, you do. i am here to take my painting back."
18256,Susan,i'm fine. i just didn't want you to see me crying.
13864,Susan,no. my clothes were already off. i was going to seduce you.
14357,Susan,what?
13959,Susan,yes!
15079,Susan,"mike, i'm part of the reason things got so screwed up.i just want a chance to make things right."
16214,Susan,is it gaby's birthday?
13893,Susan,"so, i had a really good time."
17675,Susan,"hi. i am declaring this our official fourth date, okay? the rules have been followed, and you may begin disrobing--now."
15560,Susan,yes?
14644,Susan,even at two o'clock in the morning? 'cause that's kind of hard to miss.
16182,Susan,yes. that's right. a condom alone will not protect you.
16923,Susan,"yeah, i've seen a lot of cable, so i get it."
15472,Susan,"okay,you want the truth?i don't knowhow i feel about you,but i keep looking at you,trying to see if you've changed,if you've grown up.you know what i see?i see the same weak coward that walked out on me three years ago."
16891,Susan,"hi. i wanted to bring you a ""welcome to the neighborhood"" present. you should try one while they're still warm from the oven."
14458,Susan,i don't believe it.
16436,Susan,i just guess i'm in a rush.
16992,Susan,"well, he's just a little piece of heaven."
15317,Susan,really?
18162,Susan,"okay, well, since you're on this moral roll, why don't we walk over to helen's? and i will introduce you. we can have some tea, and then you two could swap stories about ed's favorite positions."
18095,Susan,"jessie, i-i am so sorry."
18040,Susan,"yeah, that's what she told me, too, only, uh, it didn't."
15356,Susan,"yeah,well,believe me,behind all the laughs,there's still plenty of bitterness and resentment."
17227,Susan,"trying to protect your mother? i know. who cares? you drove the car, you ran him over, and you left him for dead!"
17687,Susan,"you know, i'm very good at first impressions. i'm gonna like this guy. why is the cab driver handing julie's boyfriend money? why is julie's boyfriend getting back in the cab? and why is the middle-aged cab driver kissing julie?"
15774,Susan,ian.
16407,Susan,"you're not actually--okay. that's it--i've had it. really, i can't have this conversation one more time. i've done nothing but prove my love to you for the last year and you cannot shut up about mike."
16928,Susan,and they taught us that art is subjective.
14433,Susan,you gave her your dead wife's ring?
17861,Susan,edie!
17671,Susan,what?!
13636,Susan,"well,time flies when you're on a stakeout in crack town."
13765,Susan,i never get out of the house.
16084,Susan,"still. it's tacky. well, okay then, uh--i'll help get you out. uh, what's your bail?"
15181,Susan,yeah.
15858,Susan,"oh, it's coming. um, and--and this 70's cover band, well, they started to play, and--that's how we got our song."
15705,Susan,"oh, i would love to but i think i'm in a rush here.i'm supposed to meet my girlfriends for lunch at 1:00.is it 1:00 yet?"
16050,Susan,"i'm so sorry. i'm, i shouldn't have done that. but, rupert, you have to admit, it's just a drawer."
14992,Susan,charming.
17341,Susan,"delfino, maynard."
14499,Susan,"it's not about what's in it, it's about the fact that he had it at all. i would bet you anything he is not going on a plumbing job and we're gonna find out."
14213,Susan,"it doesn't matter, because i will never believe anything you say,ever again."
17811,Susan,i didn't even think he'd remembered it.
15811,Susan,"i mean, the last time you did this, it turned into a lifetime commitment, and i'm just, i'm not ready for that."
16259,Susan,"i'm not at liberty to say. under the circumstances, they'd prefer to keep it quiet. i don't believe it. if there was some bimbo in the picture, i'd have heard about it."
16306,Susan,"oh! oh, s-sorry."
15149,Susan,wandering what?
16122,Susan,i am not playing with a woman that is willing to let mike take the fall for her psycho husband.
17574,Susan,"hi, guys. welcome to the party."
15459,Susan,"okay,you can share my popcorn."
18183,Susan,i need four words.
17757,Susan,"you know, she has wanted to get her hooks into mike for years. every time she would have us over for a barbecue, she always wore something booby."
17092,Susan,just a mild sprain. how you doing?
14116,Susan,yeah.
17441,Susan,"absolutely. put this on. now--let's talk about acceptable topics of conversation. you like sports, right?"
17320,Susan,"it sounds like ""mucus."""
15179,Susan,"i've been waiting for three hours.after you stormed out the other night,i started to doubt myself.i started to think,""gee, you know, maybe i should just ignore my better instincts,and i should let dr. ron gut me like a fish."""
17539,Susan,great. he's so excited to learn. are you sure he's ready to go without training wheels?
17037,Susan,"gosh, you're studying to be a doctor. that must not leave you a lot of free time for hobbies or--a girlfriend."
17773,Susan,"oh. well, you haven't. just treat him well, okay? he's a really good guy."
16218,Susan,"wow. so zach young is loaded, huh?"
14747,Susan,just to talk to you.
17310,Susan,that--turns out i spilled some club soda.
14194,Susan,i'm serious. there's something about this house that's just so cold and creepy. you couldn't tell when mary alice was alive. she just brought so much warmth and light. now there's something--i can just taste it. can't you sense it?
14474,Susan,"um, um-she, she-i uh."
14544,Susan,exactly. because she raised you right. look you have been through a lot. you've lost your mom. you're still carrying around the guilt over what happened to your baby sister.
14997,Susan,is that what you think of me? i'm a mistake?
18406,Susan,"oh, god! are you okay?"
14527,Susan,"okay. hurry, though. i just have a feeling that paul young is in the middle of all of this."
14162,Susan,there's your father. go have fun.
15236,Susan,what are we gonna do about edie?
13759,Susan,"oh, never mind! we'll just find them ourselves. we'll go find them ourselves."
18355,Susan,"oh, the truth is, um--well, it's complicated."
16860,Susan,"okay. well, i think it's time for a break."
15263,Susan,"no,no. i'm okay.i-i'm just-- surprised.well,congratulations.what makes you think he's gonna propose?"
14877,Susan,"oh. well, i mean when two people split up, normally they don't give things back like valentine's day cards. if, if, you can throw it away. just please don't give it back to me, it's tacky."
17573,Susan,"no, it wouldn't."
14189,Susan,"oh, my god, yes. we should do that."
13437,Susan,"uh, i'm gonna say no."
16379,Susan,"what, you've never heard of a midnight snack? unless you can think of something else that i can nibble on."
14033,Susan,what's paul doing here?
17156,Susan,"mm, well, maybe you won't mind doing a little scrubbing when you come home next week."
14538,Susan,just get the hell out of here.
17337,Susan,"well, i'm not sure that the world war ii argument is gonna fly."
15462,Susan,"orson,i'm flattered.uh,really.you--you don't wanna date me.i-i mean,my love life is just so complicated right now.well-- no,i won't bore you with the details."
16155,Susan,i didn't know they were gonna come tonight.
17804,Susan,you're welcome.
16357,Susan,"i'd like you to say, ""we don't need this. we trust you."" but you don't, so i'll sign it. and once i do, i am going to earn your trust by being a good wife to ian."
14478,Susan,i knew you'd be happy for us. so what's going on?
17390,Susan,so were you. oh. and--time to go.
18351,Susan,i know. and feel free to throw me out of your house if i'm out of line--but do you love her?
14322,Susan,morty!
13711,Susan,"yeah. yeah. no, actually no, i don't know. so, by old friend, do you mean college pal, bowling buddy, saved you from drowning?"
17964,Susan,mike said he can't afford to pay for m.j.'s private school. now i know why. he wants to see his girlfriend wearing pearls when she flashes him.
14454,Susan,oh my god! oh my god!
14795,Susan,i'm sorry. i just can't trust you anymore.
17476,Susan,"can you leave, please?"
17637,Susan,we just have so much baggage. i wish we could start over. can we start over?
18017,Susan,"well, that's the way it's gonna be, whether you like it or not."
15596,Susan,"bree, i'm worried about you.do--do you think that you should see someone?"
17993,Susan,yeah. come on in.
14948,Susan,"well, you've been married four times. i think you got it down."
14464,Susan,"and bob , i can't even begin to tell you how much that means to me. so, i'm going to walk up to that house, and you're going to let me. and you know why? because behind that badge and that big, you could crush me like a fly, chest, there's a heart. a heart that believes in love."
15395,Susan,"her,too."
15930,Susan,susan.
15470,Susan,that was not a coincidence.
16093,Susan,five-thirty. but i am rewarming it all by myself.
14485,Susan,"oh, i was just rude back there gloating and everything and i apologize."
18061,Susan,"oh, right. that's not till later this year."
17514,Susan,"he's a boy. that's my point! i know nothing about raising boys. and i think m.j. has figured this out, so he goes straight to mike whenever there's a problem."
14390,Susan,i'll talk to you girls later.
15122,Susan,"yeah,but now that i think about it,i bet it's just all the coffee i drink.i drink way too much coffee.do you like to drink coffee?"
14076,Susan,are you okay?
13586,Susan,"but remember what the note said ""i know what you did. it makes me sick. i'm going to tell"". that's not the kind of thing that someone writes to themselves. that's a message, sent by an enemy."
15896,Susan,no! you--you--mike? you don't even want him! you're just doing this to hurt me.
13700,Susan,i figure dana has something to do with what mary alice was trying to hide.
14523,Susan,"yes. let's call it stressed out. uh, so how did you get martha huber's journal?"
13376,Susan,"it doesn't matter, she was his wife. he deserves to have all the facts."
14445,Susan,what about dana?
14003,Susan,"i've been thinking about this for the last ninety miles and you don't have to forgive me. you can go to the police, kick me, you can burn my house down. you just have to know that i am so racked with guilt, i don't think it's possible for me to suffer any more than i'm already suffering."
15378,Susan,"no,ron,don't go!"
15672,Susan,"stop it! oh, my--what are you--just stop it!oh, that's enough!just get off! get off! go! go!"
14489,Susan,"look, i feel really bad about deirdre, and i know that you must want to find out who killed her, but if we're gonna move in together, we can't have this stuff hanging over us. you've gotta get rid of it. all of it: the file, the map, the gun, especially the gun and leave this to the police. they're the professionals."
16888,Susan,"mike, they live 15 feet from us. if we have a fire, i wanna be sure that they like us enough to call 9-1-1."
16154,Susan,it may be a little late for that.
15796,Susan,"oh, ian. it's okay. some people have a lot of lovers, and some just a few. it doesn't matter."
14660,Susan,"edie, for god's sake. why would i care if you end up with a man i despise?"
17126,Susan,"oh, well, you'll reel somebody in. you always do. you should have seen his last boyfriend--justin. he was so hot. you really had a thing for the young, ripped muscle boys, huh?"
15533,Susan,"hey! hey,you,wait,wait,wait. um--okay,you cannot tell edie about this.whatever she's paying you,i'll pay you double."
15635,Susan,"okay, now i know it's a little more cramped than we're used to, but we can't stay at bree's forever.she's gonna be coming back from that spa vacation soon.besides, it's gonna be fun."
18334,Susan,hey. i need to talk to mike.
17050,Susan,"yeah, your friend. i told you last night he was coming by again."
13620,Susan,okay.great. fine.thank you.
14822,Susan,well. then i can wait. i can wait. i'm a good waiter.
14517,Susan,"i haven't heard back, and i was getting a little concerned. the girls and i were talking, and, we think that maybe paul young killed mrs. huber, and if he did, then maybe he killed your old girlfriend, too, so we should really talk about this, so call me. i love you. bye."
15303,Susan,out!it's not funny.
16909,Susan,"oh, please. what are neighbors for? raphael?! here, puppy!"
17482,Susan,"well, what did he say?"
15353,Susan,i am aware of that.
14241,Susan,"come on, that's a really 3rd-grade thing to say."
16815,Susan,please tell me this isn't gonna be one of those things where you leave me and i go screaming down the street.
13402,Susan,it's not like that. the more the merrier.
13314,Susan,"i don't like that word, julie. but yeah, that's a great example."
13855,Susan,"damn, karl, i'm not even married to him anymore and he's still keeping me from having sex."
17218,Susan,"maternity lingerie - ah, right. why don't they just call it what it really is? a pup tent to hide your stretch marks."
16500,Susan,"family's terrific. seriously, you're just wasting your time here."
13665,Susan,"hey, paul."
15808,Susan,"i was gonna stay mad at you another hour, but your damn accent gets me every time."
17371,Susan,"uh, um, no, i-i haven't seen her."
18316,Susan,"yeah, um. did you say something to m.j. about going on that fishing trip?"
15895,Susan,see? evil! evil!
13508,Susan,huh?
18267,Susan,"this--i mean, this is really the only thing you can do to stay here and do your work?"
18373,Susan,that sucks. how could they cancel your flight?
14277,Susan,let's go inside and call the insurance company.
14636,Susan,jogging? there's no law against jogging.
13627,Susan,"aw,maybe it's my fault. maybe i just imagined an entire relationship with this man that didn't exist."
13829,Susan,what is wrong with you?
16976,Susan,so you killed him?
17496,Susan,well--a girl.
13601,Susan,it's a shame. they used to be such a happy family.
17666,Susan,"you know, that was hard for me to share, and the fact that you just make light of it--no, i'm am calling the second date officially over. and you know what? i was going to let you feel me up over my blouse. but now? nada."
16557,Susan,"can't? there's no ""can't"" in love. there's a man on that mountain that i intend to spend the rest of my life with, and nothing is gonna keep me from him-- not fate, not destiny and definitely not you."
16998,Susan,and how does danielle like her baby brother?
16354,Susan,mike. i saw you watching us. we were just talking.
16288,Susan,it always is with you.
14658,Susan,"not if you're sucking my exhaust, you won't."
17605,Susan,"hi, guys. welcome to the party."
13810,Susan,"hey, do you need any help?"
17372,Susan,"hey, katherine, are you all right?"
15063,Susan,you do?
17318,Susan,"oh, i know you do. i don't, and neither does the baby. philip? oh, phil? see? nothing. not even a burp. here's a thought. how about ""nathaniel""?"
17172,Susan,"shame on you! his mother trusted me to take care of him, and you swoop in like some swooping, sex-craved--oh, for god sakes, tim! pull up the blanket!"
17305,Susan,that was club soda. amniotic fluid doesn't have ice cubes and a lemon wedge.
14465,Susan,"it's not my fault, you don't have love in your heart."
14050,Susan,sure.
17712,Susan,"oh, reminds me of being young and single. oh, i wish i'd never given up that."
15702,Susan,don't say it.you just keep doing your job and i'll keep doing mine.oops.
17359,Susan,"well, i have to agree. she's changed. she's not that fun anymore."
14393,Susan,"well, yeah, we did. we were just looking. it doesn't matter, it was dumb."
14453,Susan,give me the bad news first.
17178,Susan,not really.
15264,Susan,a ring!what did it look like?
17549,Susan,"just listen. daddy really wanted to be the one to teach you to ride your bike, and if you can already do it, it's gonna make him sad. so just let daddy push the button. understand?"
17025,Susan,hey.
18200,Susan,"you, too."
13832,Susan,i thought that--
16187,Susan,you are gonna make a really good mother someday.
17881,Susan,this is not proof of anything.
13578,Susan,"edie, wait! um, you should take my ticket."
16614,Susan,"gaby, i spent months planning that wedding."
14540,Susan,what'd she say?
15884,Susan,"mike, why are you being this way?"
16566,Susan,"oh, it's a face mask. it's lavender and honey. you want some?"
15673,Susan,"oh, my god.what? stop! that's enough. enough, enough. back up.and that ring-- that was for me, right?"
14606,Susan,wow.
16808,Susan,"okay, i admit that there's a certain lack of consistency there."
17638,Susan,hello?
14583,Susan,you never asked me why zach wanted to shoot you. aren't you curious?
18116,Susan,i told the class to draw something that made them happy. all the other kids drew kittens and rainbows. your son drew small intestines on the end of a stick.
14384,Susan,zach! what do you think you are?argh! argh!
15070,Susan,okay.
13447,Susan,so when is this shindig?
13332,Susan,"no, i'm just trying to remember. i don't wanna talk to you about my love life anymore, it weirds me out."
15305,Susan,"oh.okay. ow,ow. that's actually starting to be painful."
13792,Susan,"well, i hope that, your, you know, little secret keeps you warm at night because you're throwing something really great away to protect it!"
18160,Susan,"oh, i get it. so you feel i judged you, and for revenge, you're trying to make me insecure about my marriage."
17137,Susan,"i wanted to bring flowers, and i was shot down. that's all i'm saying."
14637,Susan,shopping. that's casual. that's fun.
16856,Susan,dibs on lynette! she's on my team!
13696,Susan,i just have a feeling.
14898,Susan,"oh no, no wait, no wait, no wait. four glasses is my limit."
14306,Susan,"okay, can we focus? what i want to know is have you thought about what's going to happy if you don't go back to morty?"
14928,Susan,we all cleared our schedules. we thought maybe you could use some company.
18015,Susan,you're trying to get your hooks deeper into mike by showing him how much his son loves you.
17306,Susan,"i'm sorry. i panicked. your mother just invited herself to stay with us for three weeks, and you said nothing. i had to come up with a plan."
17796,Susan,"hey, katherine. what a cute top."
17435,Susan,"hey, hold on. you don't get to just decide these things by yourself."
18001,Susan,i don't need the details. i had a long day. i just want to pick up my kid.
18295,Susan,"hey, katherine, is mike here?"
17591,Susan,i know. i'm thinking--that maybe that was a mistake.
17331,Susan,"yeah. i said that, didn't i? oh, shoot. we can't do it. isn't your grandpa james significantly older than grandpa maynard? shouldn't we honor him first?"
15840,Susan,i bet you'd move faster if jane were awake.
16686,Susan,i hate to see you drive when you're this tired.
14722,Susan,i accept.
17098,Susan,"you will go to rehab, or so help me, i will leave you."
14129,Susan,hi.
13650,Susan,"oh,thank god. listen, don't ask any questions, just get somebody down here to pick me up at the corner of ninth and foster."
17914,Susan,"hey, bree, i know what you can make for the wake--that flaky-breaded-shrimp thing."
16698,Susan,"you are happy,right?"
15801,Susan,nine.
13836,Susan,"god, you are so weak!"
16475,Susan,do you think she actually killed him?
13805,Susan,"julie, you'll never guess who you got a letter from. zach. isn't that weird, him writing you?"
14890,Susan,i'm sorry. are you okay?
17035,Susan,orgo?
16675,Susan,"you've been sneaking out while i've been asleep? what are you, ninja plumber?"
16871,Susan,"it's just gonna get worse. do you know, when our babies go to college, we'll be like--"
14024,Susan,"well, i'm glad you can laugh about this."
17278,Susan,sorry.
18304,Susan,yeah. mike agreed to keep paying me alimony. he just sent me a text.
16415,Susan,don't panic.
18027,Susan,"hey, did you manage to keep that antler chandelier out of here?"
18098,Susan,"you know, i don't get why people say that. i-i love pity. pity means someone is trying to understand what you're going through, that they sympathize, and i do."
13630,Susan,i dunno. what does that mean anyway? my life is complicated?
14955,Susan,"okay, again, what does this have to do with my father?"
14172,Susan,why?
15687,Susan,"karl, we've been through a lot together.we will always be connected by julie, but-- i know why you bought me that house, and i'm not moving into it."
14504,Susan,"all right, what the hell are you up to?"
13546,Susan,"we talked to paul, told him we need to show him something."
16533,Susan,"ian, i love you."
17969,Susan,what?
15921,Susan,"oh, i don't think that's a good idea, 'cause i, i didn't really bring my a game. is it hot?"
16702,Susan,"""pretty much"" means there is something that you want that you don't have. how can i give it to you if you don't tell me what it is?"
16442,Susan,"hi. um, mike, i want you to meet maggie gilroy."
17312,Susan,um--sorry. go on.
14427,Susan,do you think you can help me?
14013,Susan,i don't think so.
14137,Susan,"yes, on valentine's day."
15855,Susan,okay.
14790,Susan,where's jeannie?
16718,Susan,sorry.
16911,Susan,"oh, he will. come on. you gotta keep believing."
17882,Susan,my grades sucked?
16738,Susan,is that all you see in our eyes?
14351,Susan,"alright, we get it. she looks young."
15712,Susan,the coffee machines was broken so i got us a couple of smoothies.they had strawberry and strawberry.
14919,Susan,"karl, i want to move on. i don't want to go backwards. i'm sorry, but thank you for the explosion. i really needed it."
15009,Susan,"well, sure."
15603,Susan,"okay, wait.could you just swallow?'cause i couldn't really--what you were saying--"
13536,Susan,"well, that's not-"
14617,Susan,"hi, ida."" ""can we talk about this later? i just found out my ex is dating my neighbor, and i'm really ticked off."
15616,Susan,"okay, edie,i'm in trouble here."
17934,Susan,"um, i think you have been the most consistent male relationship in my life. you're so stable and reliable, and i just--always thought you'd be around. which is funny, because i don't really know anything about you."
15639,Susan,"uh, no.have you tried her cell?"
16508,Susan,stupid?
18309,Susan,"oh, no, no, no. you--you can't take him now."
16782,Susan,"shh! jeez! ooh, mike's in the other room."
18180,Susan,we'd find a lot of traumatized cows.
15532,Susan,mike--
16072,Susan,"so i'm cooking dinner for ian's parents tomorrow night, and it's the first time i'm meeting them, so i sort of wanna impress them."""
13687,Susan,"okay, fine, if you don't want to help me, i'm not going to force you."
14304,Susan,"my pleasure. so i was thinking maybe you should call morty- you know, get a start working things out."
13678,Susan,it's not big deal. it's just for a couple of hours. i let you borrow my eggs for a whole year.
17693,Susan,before that.
17214,Susan,since when?
18342,Susan,what?
18310,Susan,"please, can't this wait? we're about to get married."
15019,Susan,uh-huh. what's up?
15199,Susan,what?
16749,Susan,i know. she was like a sister to you.
16511,Susan,"oh. well, that's a relief."
16019,Susan,i'm just saying that we never spend the night at your house.
17665,Susan,"okay, do you know how sad it makes me to know that you only braised it to boink me? you're supposed to be asking me questions. the point of all this was to get to know each other better."
16858,Susan,"okay, 22 seconds. lynette, you're up."
14123,Susan,"oh, don't write that down. oh, but this is good. you can let mike go. he's innocent."
18194,Susan,how'd that go?
16828,Susan,"yes. i am hosting a charades party, and all of my friends went out their way to insist i invite you."
17472,Susan,"well, those last few months we were together, i--the things i said to you, the way i acted--i mean, i'm not proud of the person i became."
16913,Susan,"you know what? don't worry about it. i'm gonna go inside and get us some water, and then we're gonna just keep looking."
14333,Susan,absolutely.
13749,Susan,"wow, that's quite a pitching arm you've got there."
15893,Susan,"no, no, no, no! no, no, this--this is not how this ends. no, evil does not triumph over good."
14462,Susan,"look, um bob, let me try to explain."
16380,Susan,it's a thank-you gift for mike.
16010,Susan,"your feelings? my god, you are the worst bad cop ever! go to your room. not you! get back here!"
16801,Susan,i'm pregnant.
16618,Susan,i'm rushing? you met victor three months ago. i've known mike three years.
16229,Susan,"so, erika, you were fighting with that guy when i came in. have you had a lot of those organ donor people around today?"
16107,Susan,fine. i'll cook myself.
15296,Susan,give me that. aah!
17748,Susan,you are still beautiful. so you've gained a little weight. who hasn't? don't go by me. i have a weird metabolism.
15828,Susan,are you serious?
16493,Susan,say you're sorry.
14222,Susan,"great, just great!"
17561,Susan,jason taught him to ride the bike.
14529,Susan,it's funny you should mention sin. i think adultery still falls in that category.
13926,Susan,"okay, have fun."
16396,Susan,"i just bought it. but if you don't like it, feel free to rip it off me."
18395,Susan,canterbury road? that's where we--
17893,Susan,"edie, what the hell?"
16374,Susan,"okay, don't panic. just grab onto my neck, and i'll swim for the both of us."
16009,Susan,"exactly. thank you. wait, no, that does not apply to you."
14114,Susan,i don't hate zach. i just think he's sort of crazy.
14940,Susan,"i'm here. hi, morty, reverend hopkins. i'm sorry i'm late to your rehearsal."
16000,Susan,yep! get him.
17175,Susan,"okay, so i have to ask. this thing that happened with you and katherine 12 years ago--was it an ongoing affair?"
14498,Susan,"well, that's before i found mrs. huber's journal in his truck."
18331,Susan,why is that? when did being practical and realistic become synonymous with bitchiness?
14537,Susan,she was?
16469,Susan,you bet me in a game of poker?
17845,Susan,lee wouldn't do that. he loves you.
14852,Susan,"i don't know how i know this, but i, i think that he's in utah. he, he took a bus to bountiful. you have family there, right? okay, i gave him the bus fare."
17507,Susan,i barely tapped her. she was milking it.
14812,Susan,what did he do?
15695,Susan,then i'm gonna have to find a way to force it on my finger.
14346,Susan,you just broke up with morty two weeks ago. don't you think you could at least pretend to mourn the relationship.
16993,Susan,did you hear something?
14099,Susan,so?
18248,Susan,"oh, uh, right. jackson, you remember mrs. mccluskey, don't you?"
15483,Susan,"hello?oh,hi,edie.uh--yeah,he's here.hold on. how does she know you're here?"
15733,Susan,"well, i'm sorry i cannot sit here on my key lime ass and watch bree make the worst mistake of her life!"
15362,Susan,so you sent him over to mike's?
16481,Susan,they bet me in a game of poker. they made decisions about my life over a hand of five-card stud. wrong does not even begin to cover it.
14719,Susan,what's wrong?
17547,Susan,"come on, m.j. your daddy's waiting."
16600,Susan,"well, what could be more important to you than my wedding?"
17346,Susan,griselda--that must have been a tough name to take out on the playground.
15597,Susan,"okay, well, then why don't you stop and go to bed?"
16308,Susan,yes!
13614,Susan,"hey,mike."
15202,Susan,hi!
18099,Susan,"well, here's how. um, i--i've spent my whole life putting myself out there, and, um, i'm still--today, alone."
18378,Susan,okay. it's no big deal.
17400,Susan,yeah. he--he's hard to keep track of.
18010,Susan,"hey, sweetie. how was your sandwich? m.j.?"
15224,Susan,oh! uh--
13553,Susan,"and when i realised i couldn't put out the fire, i ran. i must have dropped the measuring jug in the process."
13348,Susan,the clog's in the pipe.
13572,Susan,edie! i thought you'd be at work.
16444,Susan,"well, i'm not available, so if you feel like kissing someone tonight, point those lips at maggie."
17970,Susan,well--at least you won't feel bad if you ever lose them.
14854,Susan,hey!
16723,Susan,"i don't need any test!i am not old enough for menopause.now i don't know what kind of nonsense they taught you at.harvard medical school,class of '97?oh,my god!i am old!just give me the damn test."
13439,Susan,"well, it was your dog, i get it."
13675,Susan,"oh, forget about it, it's not that important, but since i'm here, do you still have that old hatchback sitting in your garage? can i borrow it tomorrow?"
17412,Susan,"the problem is, if you meet my friends, then we're in a relationship, and i can't be in a relationship right now."
17350,Susan,get them out of here now.
13890,Susan,has anybody talked to bree? how's rex doing?
15788,Susan,"so-- brandy, a roaring fire, what could be more romantic?"
16126,Susan,i snuck into his office and rifled through his things.
17004,Susan,"okay, don't tell anybody i told you this. her mom said something at my party about her dad being abusive towards katherine--and maybe dylan, too."
16269,Susan,"well, well, uh, before you say another word--take a look around."
15203,Susan,i came as soon as i got your message. is this--?
14565,Susan,is that?
17948,Susan,fantastic.
16376,Susan,"look, there's somebody on the shore! it's mike! he's here."
14063,Susan,"well, we've all been in their house. have you ever seen a picture of another kid there? i mean, why keep dana's baby blanket and throw out all the photos?"
18187,Susan,we need to be annoying and persistent. we're good at that.
13912,Susan,"no, no! it's fine. it just kind of caught me off guard. i mean, i want to say it back."
17409,Susan,is it? i can't tell. ooh! excuse me.
16986,Susan,"at the motel. i slipped out without waking him. i've been up all night thinking, and i have something to say to you. i don't believe you. i don't believe that you could kill a man and not regret it."
17636,Susan,"wow--we really messed this up, didn't we?"
16848,Susan,you know what else is private? the parts of me that i'm pretty sure he snapped with his camera phone. i have a party to throw. i will deal with you later.
15867,Susan,edie?
17297,Susan,"oh, my god! my water broke."
18137,Susan,"no, it's okay. it landed on the detergent box."
15642,Susan,he was just here. i think you should call him.
15165,Susan,"the first time you'll see me naked,i'll be on an operating table."
18412,Susan,new york!
14713,Susan,poor julie.
15347,Susan,"wow, she's-- gorgeous."
17139,Susan,sorry.
18386,Susan,"we're playing a game with dave, okay? so run as fast as you can."
16069,Susan,is it really important that i make them a home-cooked meal?
13406,Susan,i thought that was a look she was going for.
13948,Susan,a spark?
16334,Susan,"okay, stop this. we invited you here to celebrate our engagement. now i'm divorced, and ian's disinherited?"
18037,Susan,it is possible.
14895,Susan,nope. this one's for adults about all my failed relationships.
15660,Susan,karl! what are you doing?
16839,Susan,"bree, just get me the number."
14441,Susan,mother!
17339,Susan,"hello, maynard. i love you, maynard. my sweet little-- may may. mamie. nerd."
16169,Susan,"yes, i have."
14066,Susan,and meticulously hand painted. whoever sent you that must really love you.
13451,Susan,"no, it's sort of a way to honour mary alice. it was so important to her."
17690,Susan,and a damn good one.
17277,Susan,i don't have one.
17121,Susan,"that is not enough time. she just started stenciling the kitchen, and i didn't want to tell you this, but there is talk of an herb garden. i've gotta stop her."
14573,Susan,no.
13949,Susan,a moray eel would seem safe after you.
17905,Susan,i wonder how many people are gonna show up. mrs. mccluskey was saying he didn't have much family.
17755,Susan,yeah. can you imagine how upset i was when i discovered he's dating a friend of mine?
14851,Susan,a knife. i just want to slice some tomatoes.
14392,Susan,who told you that?
13660,Susan,favourite band?
14724,Susan,good night.
15207,Susan,"oh! oh, ah. sure, that's--wednesday's great.i'm--i'm just curious--how did edie convince you to do this so quickly?"
16770,Susan,"well, it sounds like this party could be on the wild side, and it is starting very late."
16360,Susan,you can count on it.
16747,Susan,"well,now i believe you."
13702,Susan,hmm. how about midnight?
15680,Susan,"he's karl.he's playing me. but that house is gonna be a great place for my daughter to live.and when he makes his move, he's gonna realize that i was really playing him.so-- about that ring--"
15992,Susan,you keep your nephew away from my daughter or else.
14680,Susan,"no. no. i mean, i'm a little surprised that you didn't ask me to accompany you first."
15027,Susan,what?
18152,Susan,"no, you're being immoral. you're committing adultery."
15545,Susan,really?it seems like forever.let me top you off.
15170,Susan,"okay, red flag! see, i didn't go to medical school,but i'm thinking--not all the same."
14093,Susan,"well, i could see why you would be."
15831,Susan,mmm.
14731,Susan,i'm just happy to be spending the day with you.
13927,Susan,what the hell is she doing here?
14350,Susan,"um, mom. could i just talk to you in the family room for a minute?"
16328,Susan,hello!
16757,Susan,i know. i will lend you my salad bowl. you really don't wanna miss bree's pie. it's perfect.
17281,Susan,"he told you that? well, we're getting past it."
14725,Susan,yeah?
17719,Susan,what is this about you never getting married?
17189,Susan,"orson, you were naked in this kitchen last night."
14619,Susan,"what are you saying, that your father actually told you he was gonna be having a one night stand with edie britt?"
18062,Susan,the lady with the purple swear?
13616,Susan,so you member that cop from the neighbourhood watch meeting ? he agreed to run a fingerprint check on the screwdriver i found at mrs fome's house.
17669,Susan,right! what time is it?
17021,Susan,"god, the only advantage he needs is to have a healthy dad who's not doing this."
15169,Susan,"well, you know,you're gonna be--hacking into me,and i just wanted to make sure that you feel ready."
17002,Susan,wow. you never ask for my help. must be something easy.
17438,Susan,"oh, hey!"
13628,Susan,"yes,and the flirting made me think that he was kind and trustworthy and honest and hygienic. that's how it is with me. a guy just smiles at me three times and i'm picking out wedding china. i'm a mess."
16521,Susan,"probably weren't expecting to see me, huh?"
15959,Susan,what the hell's going on?
16063,Susan,"absolutely. so, i assume this means they know about me?"
16925,Susan,i think it's a sculpture.
17513,Susan,"like, i have this rule--no toy guns. except everything that m.j. picks up--whether it's a hairbrush, a hanger, everything--he pretends it's a gun."
15087,Susan,i'm fine.
15276,Susan,"well,that's a little extreme."
13859,Susan,"oh, candles, candles!"
14278,Susan,and then the police showed me his mug shots.
14855,Susan,"oh, no, mom, stop! what is it?"
15668,Susan,"uh, well, he's not moving in with us."
16209,Susan,that's still ten years in prison.
16452,Susan,i don't wanna talk about it.
13489,Susan,"hey, are you okay?"
16850,Susan,"great. okay, you pick first."
13335,Susan,really?
16301,Susan,"uh, yeah, i, uh, have to get this sized. it's--it's a little loose."
16159,Susan,we do. can we talk about this later?
17439,Susan,"ah, no."
18427,Susan,"mike, i didn't do it to hurt you. you've gotta believe me. i--"
17950,Susan,"okay, you know the problems they're having at his school. and now with all the budget cutbacks--i mean, this place is fabulous."
16336,Susan,i should probably get these inside.
18302,Susan,thanks.
14533,Susan,i'm just gonna go get some water.
16212,Susan,i have told you i love you a thousand times. where is all this jealousy coming from?
15244,Susan,"yeah,okay.well,i'll just grab something out of my jewelry box."
13760,Susan,nothing. it's not important.
18374,Susan,right. so how long do you think you'll be delayed?
15172,Susan,"well, neither am i.i've got 35 years on that cow."
17378,Susan,"yes, in the fall. and i needed those extra three months to get ready. i--i still have not figured out how i'm gonna get by without you."
16404,Susan,why not?
15760,Susan,so when i left the bank i called the detective that worked the case and he said that the only reason orson was never charged was because they never found a body.
17627,Susan,"well, when guys go slut hunting, they tend not to play the girlfriend card."
16183,Susan,so i was in the middle of totally freaking out when julie assured me that she's not having sex. i can't tell you how relieved i was.
16128,Susan,i'm out of lipstick. can i borrow yours?
14188,Susan,"see? shifting blame onto someone else -- that's classic criminal behavior. oh, i'm telling you, he's up to no good."
15028,Susan,"thursday, coffee at two. be on time."
15139,Susan,"your nurse wouldn't let me see you,and i--really wanted to see you,so i sort of faked all my symptoms.the dizziness,the chills,you know,all of it."
16281,Susan,we never really stopped.
14608,Susan,what are you doing?
16882,Susan,"so there's, uh-- there's three of you. well, that must be-- cozy."
15215,Susan,"i need health insurance,um, 'cause i've got this wandering spleen and--that sounds funny,""spleen wandering,"" but--actually, it's not funny 'cause it can bang into things--so i need health insurance,so i'm getting married tomorrow.and you probably think i'm crazy, right?"
16119,Susan,"as jealous ultimatums go, that's very flattering, but, i don't think that's necessary. mike and i are done."
16494,Susan,say it!
13800,Susan,i think it's just that we think that it's easier to keep it all in.
16984,Susan,"well, that's my point. when good people snap, they feel bad about it. your dad doesn't."
16296,Susan,reception?
16473,Susan,"oh, i saw the curtain move. i think i saw a hand."
16611,Susan,"oh, my god, that's my centerpiece!"
16704,Susan,"i wish edie were here.without her,there's no one to give us the dish."
16141,Susan,"oh, uh, can you hold on?"
14157,Susan,"i'm such an idiot! and you're such a liar! oh, and apparently a killer!"
15480,Susan,yeah.
16628,Susan,thank you. i was just bringing you this.
17892,Susan,"all these years, i have judged you, and--it is not your fault. oh, come here. you are the way you are because of your father."
17053,Susan,get out of my house. get him out of my house!
16361,Susan,"mike,it wasn't a movie.that was us."
17592,Susan,"we wouldn't be here if it weren't for that accident. you know that. before that, we were good. we could get back there."
17866,Susan,gladly.
14180,Susan,i'm sorry. it's just so hard to find a guy like mike. i know in my heart he didn't kill mrs. huber.
14931,Susan,"hey, mike. so my mom's wedding is in a couple days, and i know you sent back that little card saying you were coming and that you preferred beef, which, actually i changed to fish for you 'cause i tasted the beef. anyways, i know that was before we, you know--"
17288,Susan,i can't believe she made a play for orson.
13777,Susan,"good boy, bongo! run, bongo, run, go get help!"
15518,Susan,"oh, it's still a little red,but i think i got all the hot sauce out."
17094,Susan,"you keep saying that, and it just keeps getting worse."
16198,Susan,you do not get to decide this for her! what were you thinking?!
16700,Susan,"i watch you sometimes,and you seem very, disconnected,like something's missing."
17449,Susan,potato skins at o'brien's? you've made his inner circle! this is fantastic! thank you. mmm. mmm.
17292,Susan,i'm doing what now?
16601,Susan,what?
13336,Susan,"oh, i'm late for an appointment anyway."
17646,Susan,yeah. i gotta have one more. ah! thank you for doing this.
14343,Susan,the kids are waiting.
13973,Susan,"that's smart, that, that's good."
17595,Susan,thanks. do you like scotch?
15391,Susan,try the cheese.that's the best part.
13512,Susan,"oh, no, she did not!"
16599,Susan,"oh, you could change your plans."
16343,Susan,"oh, please. it's not that bad. i once worked at this fish-and-chip place. i had to wear an eye patch and a stuffed parrot on my shoulder. ""would you like to hear arrr specials?"""
18286,Susan,"aw, how sweet. and heavy. score."
16773,Susan,"hey, so how's the chemotherapy going?"
16981,Susan,"yeah, an evil person."
18190,Susan,"remember to tell him ""annoying and persistent."" and i can make another casserole."
15775,Susan,i can't 'cause i have bridesmaid stuff.
16078,Susan,"sweetie, we all wanna believe the best of the people we care about, but you cannot let your feelings for a man blind you to cold hard facts."""
15167,Susan,"so this whole splenectomy thing--you feel good about it, huh?"
17130,Susan,"okay, i know that it sounds selfish, but i did what i did because i want you to stay."
15848,Susan,"oh, god! it's so wonderful to hear your voice again."
17754,Susan,well--it's about mike.
14017,Susan,you think?
15405,Susan,"karl!karl,stop! stop!oh! it's an emergency."
15757,Susan,"my friend is marrying that man in two hours. please? okay, i need, um, ten dollars in unrolled pennies and i need to see you count it. 'cause last time you stiffed me.'"
18028,Susan,"that ""football guy"" is peyton manning. you would do well to learn that name. oh. wow."
17718,Susan,"""ever""? w-what do you mean ""ever""?"
13751,Susan,you're a mess.
15873,Susan,"girlfriend?! okay, you know what? i want marcy's number in honolulu, and i want it right now."
15540,Susan,why?
16034,Susan,"your shower has six power nozzles. with or without you, i'll be back."
14698,Susan,"well, why don't we put it to a test? julie, who would you rather have play with you?"
15437,Susan,move.
17652,Susan,what's my least favorite word?
13408,Susan,hey paul.
18274,Susan,"actually, i did think of one way you could repay me."
17995,Susan,"well, it's not better for me, especially when i'm not even told about it."
14284,Susan,what's wrong?
17290,Susan,"it's not like all the other times, edie. we're done."
13496,Susan,"okay, you have got to know that i only get that angry around karl. he just treated me so badly at the end, i-i haven't been able to get past it."
13850,Susan,"okay. i know this sounds weird, but i just need to have my things around me."
13695,Susan,i don't think that's a good idea either.
14714,Susan,"no, not at all."
15067,Susan,"well, it's your word against his."
15541,Susan,what did you say?
15253,Susan,it's okay. she knows that you make house calls.
14641,Susan,"well, uh, i work at home, so i'm home a lot working. and i just keep hearing these noises lately. uh, it's hard to concentrate."
14762,Susan,you're leaving muir and hunt? you helped build that place.
14297,Susan,i mean-he shouldn't have done that.
18419,Susan,is that blood?
15700,Susan,"look, i know it's been six months but he could still come out of it, right?i saw on the news there was this woman in peru, she woke up after ten years."
13600,Susan,you noticed that?
18075,Susan,a regular kiss on the mouth--that lasted a little longer than i thought it would.
16316,Susan,"um, guys? don't worry. she's all right."
16165,Susan,but you had to know that i would go one more time to just explain everything.
18314,Susan,"--mike told 'em that he was driving, but it wasn't true."
14836,Susan,"mike, what are you doing?"
13438,Susan,wow. you must be so relieved.
17358,Susan,mm. maynard. let's hope he's worthy.
15772,Susan,ian?
18045,Susan,hold on. i'm sorry. but neither of us exactly gets a gold star for model behavior.
14632,Susan,where are we?
18181,Susan,like what?
15737,Susan,in that case i'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles. is that okay?
14536,Susan,why?
17322,Susan,"oh, give me that. well, we need new inspiration. ooh. riley."
16479,Susan,i don't care.
15396,Susan,"oh,wait! why don't you let me walk with you?"
13418,Susan,i'm gonna keep my one little bag and go home.
17348,Susan,"oh, honey. can you get all my toiletries out of the bathroom?"
15663,Susan,what's the catch?
13455,Susan,"it's tomorrow night, so if you could just keep julie an extra day."
15183,Susan,wow.i wouldn't want you to hate yourself.
16845,Susan,"and the whole time, i just kept thinking, this is bree's doctor. bree recommended him. he must be the best. so i didn't worry when it was between a needle exchange. and the area's only transvestite bookstore. and i ignored that my shoes stuck to the floor. and there was a cigarette machine in the waiting room. but when i saw the ant traps on his speculum tray, i thought that you and i should have a talk."
14215,Susan,shut up.
14732,Susan,okay.
14428,Susan,morty? what are you doing?
18306,Susan,"clearly, you've never been married before."
18205,Susan,so--have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
16348,Susan,"and you brought it to bed? okay, romance tip number one--"
16373,Susan,how can you not know how to swim? didn't you go to summer camp?
16113,Susan,i'm pretty sure that bree's husband murdered the woman the cops think mike killed. i went to his office--
15350,Susan,"well,for starters,because you banged your secretary,and you owe me for the rest of your life."
17885,Susan,"it's not a compliment, you tramp! okay, i am not gonna take relationship tips from a woman who has hooked up with--what is it? over a thousand men?"
14247,Susan,"i can't believe edie. she doesn't have dibs on every man on the planet. if i want to go out with bill, i should be able to."
15888,Susan,"yes! that's progress! see? oh, it's all gonna come back. we're gonna be us again!"
14892,Susan,"no, i made the plumber furious. that is definitely over. so there will be no gloating from me."
15505,Susan,"she's a slutty, slutty whore.absolutely."
14073,Susan,"oh, i can't have another baby. i mean i'm so grateful i had you, you know i don't regret a minute of that, but i found it to be completely overwhelming. sometimes i even wonder how i got through it."
15880,Susan,"no, no.what we're doing today is a little more low-key. don't worry. you're totally safe. we're not doing anything wrong."
13891,Susan,"well, i don't know how he had a heart attack. he was so young."
15751,Susan,a part of you feels like you'r cheating on her.
14861,Susan,"no, no, no, no, no!"
17884,Susan,"have you ever looked in your mirror, edie? you're famous for the number of men you've conquered."
15337,Susan,why do you ask?
15326,Susan,"mike!oh,wait,stop! go back!stop! stop a second.hey!what are you doing here?"
18136,Susan,"yeah. that's what everybody thinks. but the first time we met, it seemed like we'd end up being the best of friends."
15412,Susan,"oh,no,that's okay."
16175,Susan,"oh! i found it. austin, i would like to talk to my daughter privately."
14150,Susan,julie alexandra mayer!
16633,Susan,"mm. lynette is right. you know, marriage is like--it's like these bonbons. you never know what you're getting until you're in the middle of it."
14656,Susan,"well, yes, we are. i'm gonna go."
15782,Susan,"oh, ah, no, no.i should take the guest room because i am the guest."
15500,Susan,"oh, look, the baby's doing something really cute."
17944,Susan,be bored in spanish.
14646,Susan,"hey, edie."
15945,Susan,"okay, i'm gonna need some help with this big baby. go! zip, zip, zip!"
16086,Susan,i want to.
18063,Susan,"all right, everyone. grab some clay. we're making vases."
13476,Susan,an apology. for the way you ended our marriage. you never took any responsibility for your behaviour.
17554,Susan,boy--he was just telling me how glad he is to have his dad here.
15795,Susan,why not? i think that's adorable.
15143,Susan,what about your girlfriend?
18169,Susan,"oh, not now. we have a flat."
14341,Susan,"oh, for pete's sake."
14446,Susan,it was all true. everything he said. how could i have been so wrong?
16258,Susan,"look, just to save you the embarrassment, ian's seeing someone."
16105,Susan,"i don't know. a blackmail letter, a necklace made of teeth?"
17932,Susan,you can't retire. i break too many things.
15110,Susan,that's a great idea.you could have him do a background check on the applewhites.
14226,Susan,"all right, i promise."
15677,Susan,"oh, oh, you know, you should, um, call my friend orson.he's a dentist.i'm sure he'll see you right away."
15409,Susan,that's great.
16081,Susan,what?!
15008,Susan,you came!
13779,Susan,mike? i'm upstairs. sorta.
16548,Susan,that's why i have to go. i have to make amends and heal his broken heart.
15205,Susan,oh.
16040,Susan,"well, let me help you, and we can talk. there is so much i wanna know about you. who is rupert cavanaugh? what makes him tick?"
14145,Susan,"it went just peachy, and humiliating, and shocking."
13916,Susan,big insight. the postman knows that.
16098,Susan,"hi, ladies!"
14447,Susan,"oh, of course."
17135,Susan,and jam.
14933,Susan,"of course. yeah, i see that."
14572,Susan,fine. is mike here?
17419,Susan,i meant a mechanic--not you.
17160,Susan,what was that? is someone there?
14857,Susan,"he was talking so much about julie. i tried to get him to come home with me, i mean, to, to you, but he just kept going on and on about her, and i got scared."
15703,Susan,"two, three.oh, itch, itch, itch.oh, itch, itch, itch."
18389,Susan,m.j.! don't come out!
15994,Susan,"oh, my god. you don't--"
16512,Susan,"lynette, what is wrong with you?"
13910,Susan,what?
14916,Susan,"well, i'm gonna take a shower."
14389,Susan,thanks.
16895,Susan,"okay, here's the thing. i'm a really crappy baker. to give you something that i made myself would be like an insult, so "
17224,Susan,you are never to come near my family ever again! do you understand?
14292,Susan,i said i was sorry.
16556,Susan,"well, maybe i am a little unprepared, but it'll be fine. i work out. i have quads of steel."
17148,Susan,"katherine, dylan, hi. what's up?"
16846,Susan,that is not the point! why would you send me to somebody who is obviously not your doctor?
16908,Susan,oh. it's just a baby shower--that i'm throwing-- for my best friend.
17818,Susan,you're no better than i am.
15355,Susan,what?
17860,Susan,"i know it's sudden, but i feel really good about this. and it's only two hours away, so it'll still be like we're practically next door."
16520,Susan,who was?
14929,Susan,okay.
14639,Susan,"uh, betty? betty? oh, betty, can i ask you a question?"
14710,Susan,"the other day when i saw you making music with my family, i got a little jealous and i went a little crazy and i pushed you out. seeing you sitting here today, well, i can see how much you care about julie, and she comes first, and it should be you up there playing with her, not me. so i'm sorry."
16267,Susan,"i thought after we got through this really--painful day, things would start to get better. i thought i could be more a part of your world. now all your friends and family are just gonna think of me as the crazy lady from jane's funeral. oh, god. oh, ian. okay, this is not supposed to be about me. you should be upstairs--saying good-bye. i'm just gonna hide out here with the departed until everybody leaves."
13794,Susan,"lynette! you know, when are you coming back? lynette! lynette!"
15238,Susan,i know.i was listening to you.
17817,Susan,"i'm sorry. if you're interested, i have dirt on bree."
15591,Susan,guess not.
15336,Susan,great.i'm about to be released.
16234,Susan,poor ian.
13847,Susan,"oh great, our romantic weekend is off."
17036,Susan,pre-med? really?
13378,Susan,"well, isn't it worse to be in the dark, imagining she did all these horrible things?"
17732,Susan,"uh, he's fine, just getting some stitches. oh. how's--wait, who are you here to see?"
15460,Susan,"i'll just wait till the lights go out, and then i'll--"
15286,Susan,and i'm really hoping you're a lefty.
13343,Susan,are you busy?
15736,Susan,i think i will have the mescaline salad.
14967,Susan,"oh, i'm not. julie, the man abandoned me before i was born. i don't have a desire to have a relationship with him."
17533,Susan,mike! what's going on?
13574,Susan,what?
14926,Susan,"believe me, i don't feel superior."
16509,Susan,lynette! what are you doing here?
13918,Susan,where are you getting this?
18096,Susan,"still, uh--i never meant to lead you on."
15761,Susan,he was the only suspect.
13666,Susan,"i got to say, i was a little surprised to see mary alice's award for sale. she got it for doing charity work, from the chamber of commerce."
17696,Susan,did someone throw rice at you?
14494,Susan,"okay, i'll keep it warm for you."
16776,Susan,why?
17774,Susan,"uh--no, thanks. i'm really busy. i have a lot of things to do today. another time though, okay? bye."
15016,Susan,"oh, well, we, we haven't even finished the high school years. i wanted to show you this one. this was from the father-daughter dance. i had to take my mother's hairstylist."
16261,Susan,i'm the bimbo. he's my meat. all righty. i just wanted to clear that up. and now i'm going to go find myself a seat with a--better view.
17487,Susan,"well, she is going to get a big surprise, because your daddy is about to turn you into a killing machine."
18021,Susan,"oh, yeah. i'm so excited. you got my rsvp, right?"
16972,Susan,"um, yes, the, uh, genetic counselor, um, wanted to know a couple of things. um, i-is there any cancer in your family?"
13589,Susan,"cats can open drawers, can they?"
15546,Susan,"well,you probably wanna use the bathroom before you leave,huh?"
18073,Susan,"oh, me, too. you know, i think we should probably keep this between us. we don't want people talking at work."
17691,Susan,your what?
16227,Susan,the hospital?
15756,Susan,"well, what makes you so sure? do you have any proof?"
15267,Susan,"oh,no,edie--"
14551,Susan,"uh, and i turned around, and there was zach young - and that's zach with an ""h"" - pointing a gun at me."
17681,Susan,"that look on my face--i've seen before--in the mirror, when i'm feeling--how do you know about that look?"
17501,Susan,"juanita solis, don't you move! you are in big trouble!"
13492,Susan,today. right before the party.
15399,Susan,"wait a second,we're--we're not flirting."
14289,Susan,"oh, you can't be serious? morty?"
17788,Susan,"i mean, i could see her on the cover of ""menopause monthly."""
16185,Susan,"you can't say ""ooh-kay"" like that, either. julie's not like other girls. she's a straight-""a"" student."
14420,Susan,gabby!
15838,Susan,can't you do that stuff later?
17729,Susan,i didn't see him.
17484,Susan,ugh.
17923,Susan,just leave!
17059,Susan,okay.
13541,Susan,"i just, ah, don't."
14329,Susan,because she wants to move in with me.
13458,Susan,"uh, no, it's not!"
15380,Susan,"well,he wasn't!and nowmy boyfriend is gone.thank you very much."
15471,Susan,i remember.i also remember that you are planning on marrying someone else.
14875,Susan,"hi. okay, so i got the box on things you left on my porch."
16203,Susan,"yeah, um--about that--god, i wish there was a pill you could take to protect your heart."
16245,Susan,what do you think of this one?
14404,Susan,uh!
15927,Susan,"please, keep the food references to a minimum."
17113,Susan,don't talk. i'm smelling. what is that?
16597,Susan,so forget what julie told you about the wedding being off. it's back on.
14060,Susan,yeah.
17555,Susan,"oh, that's just silly."
17452,Susan,"yeah. but how did you know i would like it? oh, my god."
16752,Susan,she said dylan's not the same girl.
16186,Susan,"ok, you search the closet. i'm gonna look under the bed."
15925,Susan,oh!
15082,Susan,"oh!okay, write that down--nine!"
14344,Susan,"mom, would you please not flirt with the ice cream man."
16784,Susan,"i know. i just-- think it's sweet that he worries about you, and i want him to feel like he's part of the decision making process."
13881,Susan,not well. she accused me of not being a good mother.
17703,Susan,"uh-huh, she's a grown woman with stars in her eyes who's in love with a 3-times loser."
17375,Susan,i want to be able to reach you this summer when you're doing that internship.
16317,Susan,"dahlia, i am so sorry about the--"
14908,Susan,you probably don't know that your father and edie broke up last night.
14408,Susan,she changed her name because of her aunt? that just doesn't seem like something mary alice would do.
14609,Susan,"that's edie's paper, and this is edie's house!"
14626,Susan,"oh, um, your father just came over that day and told me some stuff. you know, some stuff that i haven't and can't tell you."
18175,Susan,"and your mom's new husband's never met you, so he thought it would be best if we told you."
14549,Susan,"uh! ow! oh! bongo, no! bongo! bongo! oh!"
17660,Susan,"well, i'm sorry things aren't going well. but i'm glad you told me. see? we're getting to know each other. and we wouldn't have if we'd spent the whole night in bed."
16091,Susan,"hey. wow, oh, those are gorgeous."
17500,Susan,good boy.
17410,Susan,"you, come with me. why would you humiliate me in front of my friends? are you a lunatic?"
15588,Susan,oh.
15615,Susan,"okay, i'm just gonna think that this is the meds talking,and i'll come back tomorrow."
14739,Susan,i got you some ice cream.
14763,Susan,"well, of course."
16775,Susan,so back to chemo--how's that been?
14846,Susan,"oh! oh! uh, uh, paul, you, you can't just waltz into people's houses."
14649,Susan,"well, etiquette is a lost art for a lot of people."
15542,Susan,"well,wait.why would you do that?"
14593,Susan,i see.
17194,Susan,"oh, my god. you thought i was crazy, but it wasn't a dream. you're naked! and that means you're crazy."
13416,Susan,"i don't know, i was gonna take her out at the knees, but it all happened so fast."
14071,Susan,mike wants babies.
13730,Susan,"no kidding, is she here?"
15778,Susan,"so that's my number and if there's any change in mike's condition, i'm going to the mountains with a friend. and, ah, just in case you were wondering, it's strictly platonic."
16423,Susan,"well, ian, you've tasted my cooking. it's not a thank-you. it's revenge."
16425,Susan,"don't walk in the kitchen. anyway, where is your sense of romance? it's a blackout. you have a defenseless lady. getting any ideas?"
15383,Susan,"i deserved it,believe me.after what i did--god,this is such a mess.he won't even return my phone calls."
13920,Susan,"well, you know what? you're going to come to julie's party tomorrow night, and you're gonna see karl and i together, and you're going to understand once and for all that i have no feelings for him whatsoever."
13617,Susan,"still somebody broke in, it is a crime. so the weird thing is, the cop asked me out.on a date."
13330,Susan,i can't believe you went over there.
13571,Susan,you are so sweet. i would love to go.
16657,Susan,yeah. i feel really good about this.
16180,Susan,really?
16152,Susan,i was really touched by your call. it was so big of you.
14627,Susan,"um, actually, i think what we're known for is sharing clothes. yeah. i think that's our thing."
17983,Susan,"so do i, and it's my first day at a new job. i win."
16922,Susan,"mike, wait. we should talk about this."
14577,Susan,good. there's a rumor going around that you don't wanna press charges against zach. is that true?
14792,Susan,"lonnie, how much financial trouble are you really in?"
14224,Susan,i don't suppose you have any idea where i found it?
17468,Susan,apology accepted.
16604,Susan,"okay, if you think for one second--"
17471,Susan,it's just--i don't want him to see me through your eyes.
13785,Susan,"i just came over to say i'm sorry, and i'll pay for all the damage."
15250,Susan,"karl,i think there might be snakes in here."
17161,Susan,really? cause it sounded like a girl.
14829,Susan,i don't want my pie filling.
13452,Susan,lynette?
16079,Susan,"oh, my god!"
14184,Susan,zach killed her.
16975,Susan,uh-huh. okay.
14094,Susan,we don't have to talk about that now.
13377,Susan,"no, this was serious, i know it was. we gotta find out what was going on."
15871,Susan,"oh, that's my mac and cheese. don't change the subject. what have you been telling him about me?"
18259,Susan,i heard.
14981,Susan,what? who's carol?
16881,Susan,"oh. oh! oh, that's super! yeah, i've seen a lot of cable, so i get it. you're just great."
15863,Susan,"okay, well, i'll go, but i am not giving up on you. you know, you are going to remember the night that we danced to ""car wash,"" and not just because it was fun, but because later that night, we did some things that, trust me, are worth remembering."
16553,Susan,"well, it's my daughter's. uh, the whole junior class has them."
13999,Susan,"oh, please don't do this."
16109,Susan,hi! i'm sorry i'm late. where are your folks?
17063,Susan,"yeah, and-and we don't need to say good-bye anyway, 'cause we're gonna see you real soon."
16699,Susan,"aw,that's sweet.i don't believe you."
16544,Susan,"come on. just for my peace of mind, i have to know he's okay."
14871,Susan,"over the past couple of days, i gave myself a long hard look in the mirror and i did not like what i saw."
16610,Susan,i wanna see those flowers.
16046,Susan,"listen, i know how you feel about jane, but if you could just give me a chance--i mean, come on, you can't possibly hate me this much, can you?"
15617,Susan,that's not true.
15112,Susan,"well,somebody has to do something,'cause i'm losing sleep."
15986,Susan,"no, ian, am i overreacting here?"
14938,Susan,"oh. well, clearly i have more research to do. so, what do you think? my life story, would you rush out and buy a copy?"
14239,Susan,"so, can i?"
14019,Susan,"oh, no he's not."
18201,Susan,"hey. i'm on my way to work, but i just wanted to bring you these. uh, chicken salad sandwiches, which i did not make. i bought. i learned my lesson from the casserole."
17699,Susan,shut up.
16350,Susan,huh?
14998,Susan,"do you want to tell her, or should i? i'm your husband's guardian angel."
15620,Susan,"yeah.i think it's best. i don't wanna get a rep around here for being a charity case,you know?"
17540,Susan,yeah. he's been asking when you're coming. i can't wait to tell him. i know he'll be just--ah--
16607,Susan,"okay, well, i just wanted to say that i'm sorry for getting so snippy yesterday, that when i canceled my wedding, you had every right to--"
17989,Susan,"oh, hey, baby. how's my boy? i missed you so much. are you feeling better?"
15091,Susan,and there were the noises.
14190,Susan,"no, edie, this is our chance. we should just go in for ten minutes."
17488,Susan,what?
18185,Susan,one of a kind.
16352,Susan,"ian, do you really want to start our life together making me feel like--i'm on probation?"
16463,Susan,no! he--he pounced.
14508,Susan,"yeah, part of it. why?"
16303,Susan,thanks.
16108,Susan,"and if you take orson back, you do the same."
15531,Susan,"no,no,no!no,karl lied to me.he told me that he and edie had split up before--"
17018,Susan,"sure, go ahead. oh, should i look you in the eyes? does it make it easier for you to lie?"
13381,Susan,shouldn't you be making brownies for your nerdy friends?
14917,Susan,us? what do you mean? there's no us.
13322,Susan,"yeah. i'm just so angry. if mary alice was having problems, she should have come to us; she should have let us help her."
13838,Susan,"honey, what's going on?"
14937,Susan,are you sure? that's what my mom said.
16813,Susan,"no, no, we can salvage this. just work with me."
17571,Susan,"yeah. it's great. uh, we'll be like--one big, happy, divorced family."
16020,Susan,"oh, it's also a disaster area. i didn't get a chance to clean it today."
17618,Susan,"so out of nowhere, jackson says, ""let's move in together."" i-i mean, of course i was stunned. and then when i said no, he just broke up with me. i mean, does he really expect me to be in love after just five months? that's crazy."
18012,Susan,"m.j., go wait outside on the porch. i need to talk to katherine. you can take the sandwich."
14853,Susan,why don't we both stop getting divorced? that would be a nice family tradition.
14647,Susan,what?
14448,Susan,"actually, before you go i need you to check into someone else's background. there's this plumber i know?"
16593,Susan,you can't invite people to a wedding on the phone. you have to send a proper invitation. you want people to think i'm a complete flake?
14578,Susan,"wow. um, i find that confusing."
15000,Susan,"well, i'm gonna get out of here. mr. prudy, i want you to hurry up and get back on your feet."
15595,Susan,"yeah, when you flip out in front of the pep squad,word travels fast."
17075,Susan,"fine. but you know, if i find out that you have given mike so much as a breath mint, trust me, there is not enough novocaine in this office to numb the pain i will inflict on you."
14303,Susan,usually poker is more fun than this.
13557,Susan,oh god. i hate that i'm turning you into a thief.
16247,Susan,"no, it'll be fine. ian wants me there."
15109,Susan,"well,the paper said the police are withholding the details."
17086,Susan,are you okay?
14296,Susan,"oh, come on!"
15904,Susan,i just--i just don't think that's a good idea.
17622,Susan,that's not enough.
17580,Susan,"i don't know. um--i'm sort of going through a difficult transition in my life right now. i need a change. uh, i was thinking--taupe."
13784,Susan,mike--
17784,Susan,seriously? that's terrible. is she okay?
13334,Susan,"hi mike. i brought you a little housewarming gift. i probably should've brought something by earlier, but--"
18426,Susan,edie!
14706,Susan,"if you think edie britt cares about anybody other than herself, you are living in a fool's paradise. you don't know her the way i do, and the only reason she's interested in julie is to mess with my head."
14461,Susan,"oh, oh, you don't understand. i can't just drive away."
16064,Susan,"and they know about me as in ""mum, dad, bloody good news. i've got myself a smashing new girlfriend."""
17465,Susan,he said that?
13487,Susan,"okay. i know what just happened is funny, in theory, but i am nowhere near ready to laugh about it. so please, no jokes."
15313,Susan,"yes. okay.i am married,but it's only because my insurance ran out.my ex-husband has a really good coverage plan,so he said that he would remarry me so i could get my operation.only i didn't wanna tell dr. ron 'cause i didn't want him to be an accomplice to fraud."
15929,Susan,mm.
17422,Susan,"it's like you don't care at all, like you feel nothing for those people."
13683,Susan,pull up a chair.
15194,Susan,"after the embezzlement,lonny let the policy lapse.and now he's in jail,and i'm gonna die."
13414,Susan,of course.
16902,Susan,uh-huh. maybe a little longer.
13659,Susan,what's your favourite sport?
17480,Susan,"oh, sweetie. i know you're upset, but you'll feel better if you talk about it. and there's nothing you can't tell me. i'm your mommy."
14121,Susan,julie!
13642,Susan,"well,if you'd only lied to me about it once, it wouldn't be."
17125,Susan,"oh, i'm just gonna visit for a while. so, andrew, we miss you around here, but i bet you love having your own place."
15806,Susan,"to bed, alone. you know, it's something that i've always wanted to try, but i've just never gotten around to."
14921,Susan,what?
14314,Susan,it's not that i'm not excited?
17209,Susan,i can't help it. my hormones are in overdrive. didn't you get that way when you were pregnant?
14995,Susan,"oh, that's funny. so, all the times you were cheating on her, that was okay, but having lunch with your daughter, that just crosses the line? i just want a chance to get to know you."
15077,Susan,we have an idea how to bring you and zach together.bowling.
14298,Susan,ante up.
16333,Susan,"well, who's getting divorced? i'm in this for keeps."
18231,Susan,can't we just keep going the way we are?
13824,Susan,sorry i'm late.
16680,Susan,nice save.
15282,Susan,"hey,bree.how you doing today?"
16592,Susan,"oh, my god! i had julie call and cancel everyone."
15239,Susan,"11:30, wednesday morning. right?"
15900,Susan,ian! what a surprise.
16587,Susan,"oh, mike."
17623,Susan,jackson? it's me. hello? that'll work.
18206,Susan,you're kidding. so soon?
15024,Susan,i'm sorry. how is trying to pick up a hooker not your fault?
14865,Susan,"no, no, no."
15068,Susan,"you know,despite what i did--sending zach away,i want you two to connect.i hope you know that."
17806,Susan,"i know. you know, that colts jersey you bought him doesn't fit anymore."
17556,Susan,"whoops-a-daisy! oh, it's a good thing your dad's here to teach you how to do it right."
15178,Susan,we need to talk.
16849,Susan,"okay, everybody, let the games begin. um, okay. i will be team captain one. who wants to be captain number two?"
13425,Susan,he's a taxidermist.
16290,Susan,hey. where were you off to so early this morning?
13701,Susan,"i know, but i wanna look really sexy."
16421,Susan,"sure, but we can't keep leaning on him for everything.""mike, we're drowning. save us."" ""mike, it's dark. give us a flashlight."" let's go ask gaby."
15601,Susan,"no, edie, wait.um, i don't wanna fight.i know that we've had our differences,but, you know, we had a friendship going there,and i just think we owe it to ourselves to talk about what happened."
16372,Susan,what?! you said you played water polo!
16114,Susan,"no, i found evidence. look. orson was committed to a mental institution for over a year. i mean, doesn't that suggest- he's some sort of--"
17076,Susan,"what was i supposed to do, mike? leave 'em in your truck? i'm not gonna sit back and watch you spin out of control."
18150,Susan,doing what?
18089,Susan,"okay, class, let's see how our animals of africa drawings are going. oh, emma, this is beautiful. emma drew a gazelle. isn't she pretty? zachary, is that a rhinoceros? he looks so big and strong. i love rhinos."
15324,Susan,"do i,though? i mean,i do.but i don't trust it anymore.you know,those relationships turned out to be disasters.maybe i should stick it out with dr. ron,and i should try heading down a road that's growing and slower into a sort of kind of love that would sustain itself for 50 years. right?stability,comfort,endurance--i deserve that."
15370,Susan,"please,please let me explain."
17808,Susan,"sweetie, if you're worried that i don't like your daddy spending time with katherine, don't be. i think it's great."
15476,Susan,"wow.why did you change your mind?i mean,i hope it wasn't because of me,because i told you--"
14023,Susan,right at my kitchen table.
16578,Susan,the chicken.
15899,Susan,i just dropped my trowel. thanks.
18210,Susan,oh. uh--okay. sure.
16681,Susan,and--break!
17724,Susan,jackson-- he's in the bathroom.
15465,Susan,lay it on me.
15777,Susan,"oh, well, it's been a long time since i've been in the mood to. thank you."
15614,Susan,edie--
14228,Susan,are you asking me out on a date?
17165,Susan,ugh! get off that poor girl right now!
17883,Susan,"hey, i was single for several months after karl and after mike."
13329,Susan,"now that everybody's seen that i've brought something, i should probably just throw this out."
14960,Susan,"oh, my god. do you know where he is?"
15186,Susan,"well, we were just wondering--actually, we were curious about, um--"
16432,Susan,"mike, i am marrying ian. we have hired a caterer. we are going with the salmon, so just back off!"
17457,Susan,"he has a name for it? okay. that's it. you and mike are not hanging out anymore. and this little wednesday ""potato skins and susan sex tips night""? i forbid it. did mike mention he likes having his toes sucked? oops! that just slipped out."
14624,Susan,you lie.
15843,Susan,"how could you possibly know what i was feeling? for six months, i have prayed every day for that man to wake up, and you made me give up on him."
17153,Susan,"no, that's okay. it can wait."
14008,Susan,our poker games?
13503,Susan,please. call me susan.
13950,Susan,news flash! i hated all of that!
13469,Susan,"what, you mean forgive him?"
16111,Susan,but they're not here.
16294,Susan,"oh! oh! oh, okay, nobody move. i got it."
14996,Susan,"well, i wasn't consulted on that little arrangement."
17423,Susan,hey. did you pack your dinosaur book so you can read it with your daddy?
18246,Susan,why didn't you call?
14655,Susan,"okay, karl asked me to get back together the day after julie's birthday. i said no, which i'm guessing is the reason for the now legendary tequila bra-popping incident. please let go."
14774,Susan,absolutely.
13633,Susan,"then you're going to have to get zach to tell you something, so we have more to go on."
14634,Susan,"so, i'm thinking we should keep it casual."
13835,Susan,so what? you obviously don't love him.
15290,Susan,"oh,my god,they're beautiful."
13465,Susan,"yeah, well you just go to hell."
14961,Susan,is that him?
15118,Susan,younger than me.
15766,Susan,"hi, edie. nice party, huh?"
17630,Susan,stay out of this.
16004,Susan,"big picture, karl. his hand up our daughter's shirt."
17781,Susan,i'm sure you will.
16943,Susan,"well, we need our sleep."
13598,Susan,bye.
16824,Susan,"no, that was a year ago."
13713,Susan,thanks.
17743,Susan,so--i know her?
14946,Susan,there what is?
16560,Susan,"no, no. i'm invigorated. this fresh mountain air is--aah!"
17272,Susan,wow. it's all recipes.
15525,Susan,edie hired a-- p.i.?
15168,Susan,"right, right.actually,i sort of meant, um--do you personally feel confident?"
17103,Susan,i'm just trying to comfort her.
16665,Susan,"yeah, but you have to give people a choice. don't you think a chocolate fountain would be elegant?"
13961,Susan,"well, i just called to say hi, and i love you!"
16349,Susan,thank you. i don't want your family's stuff. what am i gonna do with half a castle?
17611,Susan,what?
16390,Susan,"well, he's busy. isn't he debating the mayor tonight?"
18174,Susan,"what do you mean, you two were the hottest chic?"
15882,Susan,"and when i locked myself out of the house, that's where the bush was that you found me in. naked. surely you remember that."
18043,Susan,i didn't. i didn't.
16733,Susan,i don't want you to be fine.i want you to be happy.
14524,Susan,i just really think we need to give it to the police.
15666,Susan,careful with those.the last of the crystal.okay.
16488,Susan,"oh, gaby, that's not fair. nobody really liked patty to begin with."
15314,Susan,"yeah. it--yes,i am."
16917,Susan,"$2,000?"
16418,Susan,"no, no, i got it. oh, wait. here we go."
15131,Susan,"yeah,it's pretty troubling."
15571,Susan,"this is a little awkward,and i apologize in advance for how this is gonna sound,but um--by any chance,did-- you burn down my house?"
17444,Susan,"jackson, please take this seriously."
17534,Susan,"yes, i see. and here, mommy thought we'd agreed to wait till your birthday. crazy mommy."
17424,Susan,"oh, good. mmm. okay, you have fun, sweetie."
14607,Susan,"hey! karl, i see you. just stop right there!"
14365,Susan,"mother, don't you think it's getting a little late?"
18191,Susan,in the kitchen.
16356,Susan,i don't need to. i trust you.
15562,Susan,"oh, thanks. no, that's okay.we'll stay at a motel."
16191,Susan,to watch movies.
17909,Susan,"look, i know it's quiet here, but i think you'll find there's a real charm to fairview."
16276,Susan,"i just heard from andrew what happened. i had to come see you. if you want me to go, uh--"
13613,Susan,well thank god for the thin blue line!
13422,Susan,"i hope you don't mind, i thought i'd come by early and help you set up."
18006,Susan,"okay, lunch and movie. you are one lucky boy. i'm gonna take a quick shower. try not to get any crumbs on the couch. what's wrong? it's peanut butter, no crusts your favorite."
15835,Susan,"uh, i, i think that you're sitting on my bra."
14231,Susan,"yeah. i just got out of this relationship with this guy, mike, and it's kind of complicated. anyway, i'm just not even sure where i am right now emotionally, i'm just all jumbled up and i don't think i could leap right into something new, relationship wise, you know, at the moment."
15392,Susan,yeah-- congratulations.what happened to waiting six months?
16767,Susan,"well, uh, well, the johnson's live right down the road. yeah, i guess that's fine."
14339,Susan,"i think it's natures little joke, that children ultimately end up parenting their parents."
14687,Susan,"oh. you have a little, uh, on your--"
18224,Susan,it's just your belts and ties. the police kept the rest.
16057,Susan,no.
14542,Susan,"i gotta say, i think you're making a mistake. mike couldn't kill anybody. i mean, this could just be a misunderstanding."
14135,Susan,"okay. uh, yes. he came over around ten o'clock."
13432,Susan,hey.
18362,Susan,"well, if you do, we're gonna clean it and serve it up for dinner."
13457,Susan,"you can afford a cabin, but you can't scrape up child support?"
14263,Susan,"you know, this is between you and edie. i just got sucked into the drama."
13568,Susan,"no! no, no, no. julie's got it."
18294,Susan,"yeah, i'll try. don't think he's not gonna want his gift back. and it's really heavy, too."
16001,Susan,"look, you defied my wishes, you broke my rules. did you really think i was just gonna throw in the towel? face it. i outsmarted you."
15889,Susan,"mike, i don't know what edie's been telling you, but ian and i, we're just friends."
14677,Susan,"but he's with edie. i mean, she's not exactly the maternal type. i wouldn't be a good mother if i wasn't concerned. i mean, who knows what passes for a kid-friendly, good time in there? drugs? porn? smoking?"
16636,Susan,what?
17207,Susan,"well, before you go, i just want to say that, um--having you here these last few weeks-"
14262,Susan,"well, excuse me, but that, that kinda makes it sound like it was my fault. you can't possibly blame me. i'm not the one who fired you."
16319,Susan,"julie? no, she's at her father's this weekend. is something wrong?"
15790,Susan,your heart is beating even faster than mine.
14064,Susan,we've never answered why mary alice referred to herself as angela in that therapy session.
14769,Susan,who else is using that word?
16673,Susan,it's three o'clock in the morning.
18385,Susan,"come on, honey! let's run! let's run!"
13515,Susan,what's that?
14506,Susan,"no, no, it wasn't."
18159,Susan,really?
17271,Susan,oh! oh!
16403,Susan,you weren't tired a second ago.
16866,Susan,"like what? i mean, come on. just tell me. we share everything."
16536,Susan,"no. uh, what about him?"
13534,Susan,"mrs huber, with all due respect, you're crazy."
14913,Susan,"wasn't it, though? you were fantastic!"
16157,Susan,"did you seriously think i could sit on information that would exonerate mike? i mean, if you had seen his face in jail the other day--"
17735,Susan,"oh, fine. he just needs some stitches. ooh, those cookies look delicious. where'd you get them?"
15903,Susan,"uh, edie? oh, she's just a neighbor. she visits mike after her hepatitis c treatments."
18155,Susan,home.
16518,Susan,"no, gaby, be reasonable."
17123,Susan,"hey, everybody. i'm sorry to interrupt, but the smell of that apple pie just made my mouth water."
16621,Susan,no. they're my flowers! enjoy your stolen wedding!
16205,Susan,he's not crazy about me spending time with my ex.
15485,Susan,you ripped the woman's heart out.why would she want juice from you?
18404,Susan,dave! dave!
14602,Susan,so it looks like mary alice killed zach's birth mother in order to keep her from taking zach away.
16178,Susan,sex kills!
16969,Susan,"well, he's your father. i should know him, and besides, that genetic counselor said we should gather data about your family's history. maybe you dad knows something you don't. i mean, i should meet him for the sake of our baby."
14083,Susan,"oh, that's so wonderful what you wrote, thank you. okay, i'm not gonna be any kind of company until i get something off my chest. do you remember the other day when you said that you wanted to have kids?"
15495,Susan,i'm sorry i'm late.
15339,Susan,i don't even know a mike.
16411,Susan,good. i should go.
13703,Susan,oh my god. we are so not having this conversation.
15574,Susan,letter? what letter?
15259,Susan,"oh,yeah."
18126,Susan,karl--
16545,Susan,what am i gonna do go hunt him down? i have a daughter. i have responsibilities.
14325,Susan,"yeah, i understand. so could you, uh, just go out and apologise?"
13717,Susan,"oh my god, look at this embroidery."
15612,Susan,"okay, first, let me say,i'm really sorry about the yellow jackets.and-- also, no matter how mad i am about what you did,i don't want to see you go to prison.so i came with a solution.why don't you just come forward and tell the police that you saw some vagrant lurking by my garage with a can of gasoline?and if you do that,then i'll destroy the tape.and then the insurance company will pay the claim.nobody gets hurt.does that sound good?"
16596,Susan,we got engaged last night. we're getting married!
14361,Susan,tim!
17614,Susan,"jackson, what we have here has been working pretty well."
16684,Susan,"reverend, that was such a beautiful ceremony. really, just heartfelt and moving--the whole package."
17433,Susan,"oh, i don't know that that's necessary."
14386,Susan,how? are you going to give me your corneas?
15085,Susan,"you know,i'm gonna go, uh,help julie with the food.so you guys just keep talking and bowling.talk and bowl.bowl and talk."
16965,Susan,i don't care what the issues are. you don't deny your own dad's existence.
15957,Susan,"oh, that's responsible parenting. stealing whiskey? that's it, young lady. i'm taking you to paris.'"
16870,Susan,"yeah! i-i wanted to scream. you know, are you nuts? do you just wanna jinx it?"
18399,Susan,try not to scare m.j. when you bring him here.
13933,Susan,okay.
14027,Susan,really!
17924,Susan,"i-i-if karl's coming--change the locks, then leave."
15509,Susan,"uh-- well, um--then i should just go and let you get started with that."
13375,Susan,i think we should give it to paul.
15246,Susan,"well,i trusted you not to cheat on me and break my heart."
16339,Susan,"they weren't all raw. i was trying to spell ""mike,"" and the ""m"" was goopy, but the ""ike"" was delicious. you loved it."
17251,Susan,"""hence."" that's classy. say a lot of ""hence"" when we see him."
16549,Susan,"well, what else can i do? i love him. i have to go."
13842,Susan,"if we hear anything, i will let you know right away. i understand how worried you must be."
13421,Susan,"oh. okay. sure is beautiful, isn't it?"
18217,Susan,"oh, okay. uh, what did i do?"
15728,Susan,"well, i think a ten-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it."
15962,Susan,carolyn! open up! my daughter's inside!
16008,Susan,what? no! i don't take orders from you!
17772,Susan,no--and i think it's great.
16821,Susan,"okay, once the light starts blinking, we've got three seconds,. so, everybody, say, ""cheese"" and hold it. one, two, three."
15411,Susan,"uh,just talking."
14760,Susan,i can't believe i let you talk me into this. i am so behind in my work. but i'm glad i came. this is fun.
13524,Susan,mrs huber.
16056,Susan,you don't have to push jane out to let me in.
14079,Susan,"oh yeah, this dress is just riding up as it is. if i walk any faster it'll be happy valentine's day for everyone."
16116,Susan,what?
17107,Susan,"please, this is what best friends do--right before their friendship ends."
15062,Susan,zach is back!
16021,Susan,oops!
14134,Susan,"um, am i supposed to talk into the camera?"
15173,Susan,i'm sorry.i don't mean this to sound the wrong way. i just--i would be more comfortable with an experienced surgeon.
15060,Susan,"oh, you guys,we're all friends.this isn't something to get worked up over."
15719,Susan,jane looked cold.
13746,Susan,julie and i went over this morning.
14074,Susan,"oh, i can't tell him. this could be a deal breaker. julie, i really love him. i don't want to lose him."
13681,Susan,"it hasn't really changed since girl scouts. girls smile at you to your face, and then behind your back, they make fun of you because you're the only one not shaving your legs yet."
13878,Susan,i had to send zach back. we could have gotten in a lot of trouble.
15129,Susan,okay.
17688,Susan,i know what's going on. let me enjoy my denial.
16213,Susan,"what? no, ian, we have to talk about this."
14999,Susan,my name's susan. i was buying some horse feed when mr. prudy had an attack behind the counter. i gave him cpr and called nine-one-one.
15121,Susan,"oh,well,maybe i should go ahead and see him anyway,just to be safe."
16503,Susan,"well--i was engaged to ian, so--obviously i loved him."
14142,Susan,what? what does that have to do with -
14042,Susan,they were having a very interesting conversation.
15116,Susan,"oh,no,i can't do that."
14473,Susan,thank you.
16249,Susan,"i have got to get more depressing clothes. okay, i just need to keep a low profile through the memorial, 'cause once i get through this, ian can officially introduce me as his girlfriend, and we'll finally be a normal, non-adulterous couple. what does this one say to you?"
17704,Susan,aren't i?
14654,Susan,we're in the middle of the street. would you get out of here?
13386,Susan,oooh.
15365,Susan,"oh,ah,okay.i made it."
14727,Susan,"oh, sorry. i'm helping mike find zach. you know, so we can all rest easy at night."
17174,Susan,hey.
14502,Susan,oh yeah? when your father was cheating on me i used to follow him all the time. i know my stuff. there he is.
15287,Susan,funny. so what about my surgery?
16819,Susan,oh.
16387,Susan,i guess we're gonna cut right to the--
17259,Susan,"oh, enough with the ""hence."" i'm just saying that some things are private, and i think that you can be honest without being inappropriate."
15852,Susan,what?
14575,Susan,it wasn't like that.
14070,Susan,pretty impressive.
18247,Susan,"well, you did."
17907,Susan,so--is she in?
17588,Susan,you know what? we need a minute.
13740,Susan,"absolutely. oh. ow! ow, ow."
15475,Susan,it is?
14068,Susan,ooh. that place is so pretentious. i've been dying to go there.
17369,Susan,"well, yes, but don't forget--it is a huge honor."
13686,Susan,"i don't know, julie. you pretend to be bulimic. gag a little. come on, work with me here!"
16312,Susan,here they come.
16950,Susan,"okay, fine. you're still angry, but i'm gonna make it up to you. when they come after that tree house, they're going to have one susan mayer chained to it."
17029,Susan,"i did, too, and do you know what else he has pierced? and if you do, you're grounded."
13383,Susan,"hm. uh, well it's gotta be here somewhere. just keep looking."
15044,Susan,"believe me, i didn't want to hurt anyone. i just wanted to find my dad."
15309,Susan,"oh! yeah,oh--no,no,he just said that 'cause we used to be married.it's just a force of habit."
16576,Susan,sorry.
16457,Susan,i don't know.
13844,Susan,"what are you, storing up for winter?"
14214,Susan,i know.
13820,Susan,what are you doing here?
14397,Susan,you didn't have to do that.
17141,Susan,"i so appreciate you helping us out. mike would be doing our taxes, but he's off--"
13488,Susan,pretty much.
13604,Susan,"whoops,sorry."
18359,Susan,"it's sweet, but--yeah, it's ridiculous. and besides, um, m.j. and i have big plans this weekend."
15366,Susan,ah! ooh!
13635,Susan,"how tragic! by which i mean, yay?"
16345,Susan,"so i guess this means we're babysitting the kids, huh?"
17797,Susan,"by the way, uh, i don't think you're gonna have any problem. i had a little talk with m.j."
15075,Susan,hi.
17546,Susan,damn it.
17338,Susan,you're right. my son's future is at stake. i have to do something.
14535,Susan,"uh, no, he's on a big plumbing job. what's up?"
15670,Susan,you bought me a ring?
16916,Susan,oh. what if we take it to my cleaners?
15400,Susan,"okay,yes,i am closer to your father than i have been in the past.the bitter hatred's now settled into a respectful disgust.that's the kind of thing most children of divorce dream about."
18290,Susan,"i was too proud to admit it. i'm not too proud to take it. i need that money, jackson."
16042,Susan,"okay, well, you certainly didn't have to go to all that trouble."
16927,Susan,"i don't mind it. not to brag, but i went to art school."
17799,Susan,what? i don't do that.
13980,Susan,"boy, i gotta say, i envy you."
15847,Susan,"oh, my god. you are awake."
16292,Susan,"oh, no. no one's saying smaller. no, that's crazy talk. rock me."
15583,Susan,mm.
17896,Susan,july?
14179,Susan,"maybe fifteen years ago. not anymore. now we're just lonely and desperate, and they know it, and they just sit there, ready to pounce, waiting for us to take any crumb they're willing to throw our way. i don't want crumbs. i want mike."
15022,Susan,but you were with a prostitute.
18253,Susan,"i've only been working there two months, but i love it. and the kids are so cute. and i get to see m.j. during the day, which is nice. uh, you know, uh, for a guy that just had to see me so bad, you--you seem awfully far away."
15891,Susan,"oh, but you--i was just trying to help him remember.tell her, mike.we were-- we were making progress."
15735,Susan,these dresses are hideous.
16822,Susan,i'm eating for two.
13395,Susan,julie? mike delfino just invited us to dinner friday night.
16893,Susan,"gee, let me think. nope, no nuts."
18415,Susan,"oh, you did it again!"
15497,Susan,"oh, my god."
17542,Susan,"i know! you did great! jackson, can i see you a sec?"
13321,Susan,"sure, that's fine."
13692,Susan,did it sound like a relative?
14431,Susan,what?
13770,Susan,"oh, of course."
13955,Susan,"oh god, no. karl, um, no, what i meant by wonderful was that i wondered inside if i still had feelings for you, if deep down i still loved you--"
15750,Susan,"that's a really lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story, is it?"
18165,Susan,you should leave now.
13640,Susan,and that means what?
13594,Susan,i think this is a screwdrivert left behind by the burglar. and i didn't touch it.
17702,Susan,that has got to stop. i'm gonna do something.
15257,Susan,"your mother is a rotten,sneaky person."
17146,Susan,"no, i know you're not."
16803,Susan,i am taking you home. this party is out of control.
15864,Susan,hi. you're new. where's marcy?
13643,Susan,i know who you are. you're a carl in disguise. i'm done with you: all of you.
15917,Susan,"but, you know, with ian, everything was always easy. you know, that's the kind of guy i could see myself living into my nineties with."
14000,Susan,"edie, i burned your house down."
14177,Susan,not my type.
17303,Susan,a few weeks apart. wanna go to the movies?
15996,Susan,mike--you're out of the hospital.
15592,Susan,hey.cleaning up after the big party?
18226,Susan,"you are not fine. how could you be? you have suffered a horrible loss. and you are allowed to feel any way you want. but i know that you are not fine. okay, well, i'm sorry for ransacking your house. i'll stop bugging you."
17590,Susan,"once we sign these papers, there's no going back."
13626,Susan,wow.
15508,Susan,"well,i just wanna help.so how about that movie?"
16756,Susan,"oh, yum."
13983,Susan,"i just wanted to see how you were holding up. you know, with mrs. huber and everything."
13823,Susan,exactly. you are not mature enough to have a realistic perspective on this relationship. you would be so much happier with a girl your own age.
18422,Susan,what have you done?
16719,Susan,"yeah.you know,one month off,two months on.that happens,right?"
14748,Susan,"because, i have a lot of things to say so you can just listen. i'll buy you some food. when was the last time you ate?"
18354,Susan,"yeah, well, i don't know if that's gonna happen."
16192,Susan,see? it's just a tape.
15522,Susan,"okay,stop that."
17581,Susan,"uh, thanks."
14806,Susan,oh! what the hell are - is wrong with you?!
15155,Susan,do i just repulse you?
13958,Susan,"mike, guess what? i love you!"
17120,Susan,"no. that walter guy needs to stay miserable, because if he's not, he'll fix her roof, and then she'll leave us."
15010,Susan,"that was just the heat of the moment, and once you get to know me, you'll understand that i am not the kind of person who could ever, ever resort to blackmail."
16859,Susan,edie. woman. blonde. bleach!
15397,Susan,no! i'm fine.the doctor said i should actually keep my blood flowing.
14086,Susan,"oh god, you're not taking this well. oh i was afraid of this."
15594,Susan,are you-- okay?
17641,Susan,okay. when?
14401,Susan,"zach, julie does not think of you as her boyfriend. in fact i don't think she wants anything to do with you."
13543,Susan,well th-
13714,Susan,mike had to reschedule.
14664,Susan,"oh, my god."
15358,Susan,"no,no. i got it,i got it."
17890,Susan,"oh, my god."
18164,Susan,wow. you're just a giver.
15454,Susan,"my ex-boyfriend's here.if he sees me alone,i'll die.i'm begging you,please,act like you know me."
17938,Susan,"well, let's just make sure we remember him."
18057,Susan,"well, i wanted to do something more free. it's an imagination-building exercise."
16257,Susan,susan mayer. i'm-- a friend of the family.
15419,Susan,"at this point,i'd like to point out that,uh,it was karl who proposed."
14332,Susan,"if she moves in she will burn up all my oxygen and i need it. please can't you give her another chance? you guys are really good together, you know, when-when-when there's no violence."
18222,Susan,okay.
17856,Susan,but you are fun to dance with.
18345,Susan,"yes, sure. why not?"
15807,Susan,i'm with a client. take a number.
16648,Susan,you do?
15976,Susan,"oh, my gosh.lynette."
15602,Susan,what?
14766,Susan,why?
16132,Susan,"yeah. but somebody's gotta tell him about his new lawyer. otherwise, the guy's gonna show up,and he's gonna go, ""who the hell is he?"" ian gets that. besides, why would it be a big deal? mike and i are over."
13721,Susan,you don't know what you are talking about. they're just friends.
16189,Susan,you found it?
17651,Susan,i want us to spend this time really getting to know each other.
14818,Susan,mom!
16474,Susan,"oh, that's right. she babysat your kids."
14886,Susan,why not?
13962,Susan,how creepy is mrs. huber's sister!
13815,Susan,"gabrielle, he's in high school, and, it's illegal, and you're married. if carlos found out, this would kill him."
14067,Susan,so we still on for tomorrow night?
17753,Susan,"hey, do you wanna take a walk? i need a little girl free time."
14005,Susan,you're not?
13542,Susan,will you please just drop it?
13900,Susan,here you are.
16710,Susan,"oh,you don't need to do that."
13394,Susan,"bye, bongo."
16961,Susan,"it wasn't an impression. you said those words--""my father's dead."""
15223,Susan,is there a problem?
18372,Susan,"oh, my god."
15965,Susan,i would like to trade places with one of the people inside.don't-- don't you do that?
16293,Susan,"oh! oh, my! oh, it's so beautiful!"
17640,Susan,"uh, yeah. i think i remember you."
13821,Susan,listen to me. there is no future for you and gabrielle. she's not going to divorce carlos and run away with you.
16584,Susan,"because this date has special meaning for us. i sat in front of that trailer for six hours thinking you hated me, and a proposal would've brought the entire thing full circle. it would've turned a bad memory into a beautiful one."
14124,Susan,"mike! mike, are you okay?"
16071,Susan,right--like an ambulance.
16222,Susan,"okay, i deserve the pimping remark, but let's not pretend that, you know, we're above teenagers. gaby, you're all i've got."
16697,Susan,"well,we've just been so happy the last four weeks,i thought we should celebrate."
15466,Susan,he lives three houses down.
18088,Susan,"actually, i'm more worried about the lesbian that's outside of me trying to get in. um, can we just teach the class and talk about this later?"
17576,Susan,"well, just please change your shirt."
14230,Susan,oh.
16781,Susan,"okay, look, i've been thinking about things, and--just forget what i said earlier."
18282,Susan,we're getting married.
15210,Susan,so what changed?
15793,Susan,"oh, yeah. but, i mean, you kissed other girls before that, right?"
17222,Susan,oh. what's going on?
14235,Susan,i was just wondering how you'd feel if i went out with bill.
13331,Susan,"julie, i like mr. delfino, i do. it's just, i don't know if i'm ready to start dating yet."
13965,Susan,"good news. i finished my book, so i thought to celebrate, you could take me out to lunch."
17180,Susan,"bree, that is, like, the best pie you've ever made."
13797,Susan,are you okay?
14436,Susan,oh no. no no no. they want to get their new life together started. we don't want to hold these two crazy kids back.
14261,Susan,edie!
15665,Susan,"hey, it's susan.just wanted you to know i let the electrician in your house.i hope you're having a great time at the spa."
17565,Susan,"well, it's hard for me, too. i miss things when he's with you. and i--am trying to come to terms with my guilt, because--i have to."
14793,Susan,i'm gonna ask you a question and i want you to tell me the truth. did you steal from me?
16946,Susan,"did i? well, that's obviously wrong."
17694,Susan,that's the one. so you've been married three times?
16405,Susan,"well, i'm not used to guys bailing on me in the middle of foreplay."
17230,Susan,take a step back from what? he tried to murder you.
14971,Susan,i have a dad! he's great! he gave me a hat!
17961,Susan,"oh, you know what? i'm actually still worried about the side door. do you think you could check that, too?"
15779,Susan,"ah, wow, look at the view!oh.don't you just love when the leaves change color."
15674,Susan,"oh, my-- ohh!karl, are you okay?are you okay?let me see.oh, my god."
17143,Susan,"oh, tim."
14252,Susan,"bill, um, i have my reasons."
18251,Susan,um--how about dinner tomorrow night?
13593,Susan,"well,i'm the one who discovered the break in and i think i found some evidence."
18300,Susan,canada.
18079,Susan,i don't remember.
17474,Susan,"out, uh, doing some thinking. and i've decided that i may have gone a little overboard about you and mike. in fact, i think it's cool if you wanna hang out with my ex."
13755,Susan,"sounds great. um, you do know that it's like a two-hour drive up there. and isn't that kind of late to be coming back?"
15035,Susan,did addison talk to you about me?
17460,Susan,"nothing. just, the answering machine lied to mommy."
15510,Susan,oh! uh--okay.
14355,Susan,i have not been furious with you.
15407,Susan,she's planned this whole secret wedding.it's a surprise.
18161,Susan,"you know, karl would never cheat, and the woman he was with-- brandi, his secretary, and he took her out for her birthday."
15711,Susan,let me see.oh.
13688,Susan,"because mary alice was a wonderful person, and now all anybody thinks about her is that she went off the deep end and did this terrible selfish thing, and i think there is more to it than that. she was my friend, julie, and i owe it to her to find out the truth."
17891,Susan,it's just-- now i get it.
13564,Susan,oh my! whoops!
15630,Susan,oh hi.i have a normal baby.
17319,Susan,i am not naming my son after a quarterback.
16355,Susan,"okay, i'll sign it."
13748,Susan,i hope she wakes soon. maybe she can tell us who was driving that car.
14255,Susan,"okay, i'll go out with you."
17821,Susan,"yes, that's fine. gays love me."
16649,Susan,so this is what marriage is about? having someone to hide behind?
17385,Susan,"okay, just listen to me."
13984,Susan,"i'll go with you, edie."
18049,Susan,"well, now i'm ungiving it. try to keep up."
16896,Susan,"hey, i would've made them myself if i knew how. honestly, i'm a good neighbor."
13774,Susan,"wait! wait! no! wait, don't, don't go! wait, i have an idea. here! here! here! here, grab the towel, bongo! come on, grab the other end! come on, boy! that's it! get the other end! come on, bongo! pull the other end! come on, bongo! what are you doing? bongo, over here!"
17559,Susan,"you know, why look for blame? kids fall. if you have to find fault, blame the pavement, not yourself--or me."
14817,Susan,since when?
13946,Susan,"yeah, me too. and just so you know, i'm sorry for flipping out. i shouldn't let you get to me like that."
16625,Susan,i got you a blender for christmas.
15200,Susan,"no, no,i think she's onto something."
13716,Susan,"you shelled your own crabs? okay, i don't want to butt in, but are you doing too much? because you look exhausted."
14242,Susan,"well, you know, technically, i don't need your permission!"
15113,Susan,super.
14633,Susan,"i don't know. since the guy who held me hostage turned out to be your son, i think logic dictates that i should move on. the problem is, i'm crazy about you."
13351,Susan,"that's it, just stuff the hair down."
14847,Susan,"well, that's 'cause i assumed you were someone i would let in my house. what do you want?"
17958,Susan,hi. you at home?
13357,Susan,oh.
17900,Susan,"good-bye, edie."
16026,Susan,"um, yeah, that sounds great. you pick."
13507,Susan,we've all sort of felt it.
15388,Susan,hi.
14429,Susan,now?! are you drunk?
16878,Susan,"uh, i-i just wanted to say hi. you know, i saw the movers taking in some of your furniture, and i just have to say you and your wife have gorgeous taste."
17342,Susan,"oh. working. busy, busy, busy. uh, but he told me to tell you that he's totally cool with it."
15526,Susan,how you doing?
15664,Susan,i can't accept this.i just--i gotta get out of this mess on my own.
15818,Susan,are you sure it's okay if we stay another day?
17111,Susan,sounds good to me!
16173,Susan,hi. bye.
17877,Susan,he dumped me during math class.
15653,Susan,"karl, what do you want?"
16235,Susan,hi.
15650,Susan,thanks.
16123,Susan,bree let orson move back in.
17815,Susan,i don't know. i--you don't ever think about it?
14615,Susan,"oh, now is not a good time, danny."
15341,Susan,damn that nurse hisel!
14978,Susan,"well, i just want to change my life and every since i was a little girl i've always liked horses and the outdoors. well, i'm just fascinated with feed."
14622,Susan,"no! i have not even begun ripping into edie britt yet. oh, that peroxide vulture! i just know as sure as i am standing here that she went after your father just to tick me off."
13373,Susan,"gabby, the woman killed herself. something must've been going on."
15758,Susan,the police? what did they find?
13830,Susan,"oh! ow! for god's sake, helen, this is for charity!"
14707,Susan,i'm sorry you had to witness that.
14679,Susan,"so you and edie are, are gonna be an act."
15209,Susan,really?
15513,Susan,oh.
13817,Susan,"yes it is. it's about me, and about every other person who was screwed over by somebody they loved. when karl ran off with brandy, you saw what a basket case i was. i was crying, i, i was tearing up his clothes, i couldn't get out of bed all day. you were right there. how could you do the same thing?"
16538,Susan,"well, that doesn't make sense. mike wouldn't leave without saying good-bye."
13886,Susan,"oh, yeah."
15589,Susan,"you sure that won't put a crimp in your, uh, dating life?you know, that girl you were at the movies with?"
17276,Susan,don't do that--mama.
14168,Susan,"i was on vacation. made sense at the time. okay, not to be rude, but is there a reason you're here?"
17168,Susan,"you, on the other hand"
15487,Susan,"so if edie doesn't know,then that means that you just cheated on her-- with me!you made me the other woman!"
16331,Susan,"so, uh, what won't you ask me?"
16978,Susan,"uh, and how did you--"
17510,Susan,"you know what? we've both been incredibly childish here, and it is time one of us took the high road, so i am now going to walk away. please take note of this conflict resolution and try to pass the lesson on to your daughter."
17599,Susan,"i don't want a relationship either. all i want from you is exactly what we just did. except next time, it's susan."
16401,Susan,i don't want sell my house. everybody i love is on this street.
14490,Susan,"oh. really? well ,that was easy. maybe after lunch we can talk about your leather bean bag chair."
16884,Susan,"come on, bree. you have to let us do this."
16807,Susan,"look, i get that you're upset."
16286,Susan,"yeah. except for orson, who fell off a roof. you know anything about that?"
14113,Susan,"you can see boys in a couple years, just not that boy."
15991,Susan,"julie mayer, you get back here! you're grounded, remember?! edie britt, i wanna talk to you."
16979,Susan,i just don't see how he could not feel bad about it.
18327,Susan,so--did the immigration people tell you how they found out about you?
17710,Susan,"hey, you two. what's going on?"
17384,Susan,"come here, come here."
17557,Susan,"oh, he's fine."
14712,Susan,"yeah, well, i try."
14090,Susan,mike?!
17984,Susan,"you're a plumber. ms. nelson is not expecting you on time. in fact, if you show up before dinner, she'll turn cartwheels. i'm a teacher. it's different."
16956,Susan,i was surprised that my doctor suggested genetic counseling. i didn't have to do that with my last baby.
13313,Susan,"yeah, sometimes people pretend to be one way on the outside and they're totally different on the inside."
15248,Susan,the night you abandoned me.
16622,Susan,"i mean, i'm sorry, but this time, gaby has just crossed the line, and i will not make myself sit through her wedding. julie thinks i'm overreacting. you don't think i'm overreacting, do you?"
13412,Susan,why she did it. oh! let me help you.
17074,Susan,"thank you. finally, some sanity."
15255,Susan,"oh,i have a wedding that day."
16406,Susan,what?
15300,Susan,"well,that's a big word.we just started dating,and we have a connection,and i'm gonna follow it through and see where it goes."
15225,Susan,"well, it is.l-i could die."
18151,Susan,ed is married.
14202,Susan,i've got to get the tape.
17196,Susan,"""mike""? wait. are you sleepwalking? orson. hello?"
14894,Susan,yeah.
14982,Susan,i don't know what you're talking about. i just came in to get a job.
13736,Susan,oh fun. i'm a doggie.
17114,Susan,and our oven is making its debut.
17220,Susan,you just don't want to be crushed under the weight of a repulsive cow.
16485,Susan,rip 'em!
15185,Susan,bree?we have a question for you.
15698,Susan,so you got the results of his latest mri yet?
17849,Susan,"'cause you were mad at bob, and i told you about how i sometimes sabotage my relationships."
15245,Susan,i don't know--exactly.
13356,Susan,it's upset?
16282,Susan,"ian! ian, you're not gonna believe this. bree just told me she can prove mike's innocent."
13834,Susan,why not?
16542,Susan,"okay, look, i know that i've put mike through the wringer, but that's why i have to talk to him--to make it right. he's not answering his cell phone."
16571,Susan,what is it?
15093,Susan,i don't know.
14558,Susan,thanks.
16730,Susan,"no,you said you did."
16240,Susan,maybe a little.
17212,Susan,thanks. i'm gonna try that. so you don't think i act like a lady?
14457,Susan,"oh, forget it. just let me look at it myself."
13837,Susan,what did you expect-a hug?
16941,Susan,"okay. if i vote for you, do you promise to get rid of that fountain?"
13780,Susan,"well, you see, this bird, um, flew in your bathroom window, and, i, tried to save it, but, uh, it died."
17304,Susan,"i'm not in labor, okay?"
14120,Susan,"yes, i was. it was a big night for us, relationship-wise. it was the first time that we--"
18086,Susan,"well, that's because--"
15561,Susan,my whole house is-- on fire!
16117,Susan,you would do that for mike?
13320,Susan,"i don't know. i'm sorry you guys, i just-- i just don't know how i'm going to survive this."
17844,Susan,"uh, bob--uh, lee did stay here last night. he slept on the couch--in the guest room. so you have nothing to worry about."
15536,Susan,yes!
14192,Susan,i don't know. just something suspicious.
15195,Susan,"no, there isn't time for you to deal with the red tape.my spleen is going careening into my heart.i need that operation now."
13607,Susan,it's hard to explain. even to myself.
14020,Susan,"don't tell me to chill, i have no intentions of chilling."
16225,Susan,"ian, i'm sorry, too. we've got to stop fighting like this."
15479,Susan,"now i wish i hadn't torched our wedding photos.who would've thought, after everything that's happened,that we would've ended up back here again?"
13637,Susan,so when does our official date begin?
14029,Susan,mrs. van de kamp needed volunteers. she begged me.
16158,Susan,yeah. i--just to tell him about the lawyer. i know that mike is innocent.
14689,Susan,"really? oh, i thought it made it sound more professional."
17624,Susan,are we ok?
17816,Susan,no. i'm good.
14970,Susan,"oh, oh, no. that's okay, you don't have to give me anything, really."
13548,Susan,"well, before you move, we thought there was something you should know."
17068,Susan,"no. no, you didn't do anything wrong. thanks for the supplies."
15785,Susan,me too.
14953,Susan,"yeah, well, i know what r and r means. so what does this have to do with my father?"
13495,Susan,"i don't know. god, i hope not. i mean, they're always been wound a little tight, but i've never seen him like that. then again, who am i to judge?"
16988,Susan,"if you can't feel the tiniest bit of remorse over taking a human life--no, i don't think you do."
15033,Susan,"oh, so you want me to catch it for you? i mean, you, yourself, said she's crazy. i don't want to wake up tomorrow morning and find my tires slashed."
16558,Susan,cool. how do i get one of those?
13431,Susan,is there anything i can do?
15528,Susan,well--that is karl being nostalgic.
17354,Susan,"well--i hate the name ""maynard."""
16980,Susan,"you know, i expected to meet a guy that was racked with remorse, and instead, i'm looking across the table at this--"
15721,Susan,"oh, um, you might want to give jane a sponge bath cause she had a little accident."
15874,Susan,what?!
13712,Susan,could you give it a shot?
13485,Susan,"yeah, it's-it's casual."
13566,Susan,mike!
17928,Susan,"actually, um--jackson and i split up."
13505,Susan,"bree, what does it say on the rest of the tape?"
13587,Susan,mr whiskars.
13441,Susan,"this is for you. no, for bongo. you give it to him."
14972,Susan,soon. i don't wanna ambush him. i'm gonna ease into it.
13409,Susan,i hope i'm not interrupting.
13942,Susan,top of the heap--
15230,Susan,"we got to the altar,but the whole fake wedding thing sort of imploded."
15269,Susan,karl. karl!come here!why didn't you answer your damn cell phone?
17949,Susan,"i know, i know. we may have to give up a few luxuries."
16772,Susan,missy taylor?
15029,Susan,"okay, i didn't exactly love what i found out about you today, but the goal was to learn, not to judge."
13925,Susan,"yay! oh, you guys were fantastic."
18022,Susan,absolutely. anything else you need?
16653,Susan,"yeah, he sort of wants the day just to be about us. so we're gonna wait till the fall. i'm so sorry."
14703,Susan,"well, it is a family recital, and edie is not family."
17144,Susan,"okay, so back to these receipts."
16603,Susan,"gaby, did you really think i would want to spend what would've been my wedding day watching someone else get married?"
16365,Susan,really?
17085,Susan,it's okay.
16797,Susan,"no, no, you've, uh, worked all day. you stay here. i'll go to the store."
14196,Susan,are you okay?
15820,Susan,"uh, fresh air is good for us?"
17785,Susan,i'm sorry. the--the image in my mind is probably way funnier than what actually happened. why did m.j. do that?
18033,Susan,katherine and i told you guys we were taking the high road. why won't you believe us?
16487,Susan,"yes, and do you know who i blame? i blame karl and mike. why isn't anybody mad at them? i mean, let's face it. the men-- they get away with murder. they're scum!"
18041,Susan,i don't know. she seemed to love the painting--until i told her that i painted it.
15691,Susan,"i know.but if you really do-- love me, you'll let me go."
16443,Susan,"you need to move on, okay?"
15652,Susan,"well, sometimes i say things i don't mean. i blame it on my frequent exposure to ant spray."
15974,Susan,you're going back to modeling?
14539,Susan,why?
15550,Susan,gus!
18065,Susan,"oh, well, keep looking, 'cause i don't cook, and shanghai panda delivers."
14450,Susan,go.
13615,Susan,good.i just came by to say hello.
15657,Susan,"no. no, i write children's books."
18220,Susan,"oh! you think that i'm dangerous. no, i totally have an explanation for those."
18074,Susan,it's a date.
14197,Susan,"oh, my god -- angela."
14755,Susan,"yeah, well, julie's a really special girl."
14563,Susan,"honey, you can let it out."
18328,Susan,mike? you think mike did this?
14515,Susan,"oh, i know. uh, i found mrs. huber's journal in some of mike's stuff, and i think she knew mary alice's secret and was blackmailing her."
16322,Susan,just adultery?
15868,Susan,"uh, yeah. what is she doing here?"
13860,Susan,"mike? mike, is that you? i'm up here!"
18186,Susan,"yeah, i left that casserole three days ago, and it's still there. i'm surprised the squirrels haven't gotten to it."
17158,Susan,"oh, i forgot. uh, tim has some questions about the taxes. do you mind talking to him?"
13460,Susan,excuse me. brandy. do you mind?
15608,Susan,"oh, good, then you'll be prime meat picking when you go to jail!"
16515,Susan,what?
17560,Susan,"remember, it's the pavement you're mad at."
17215,Susan,"you could say ""au gratin"" when you were 3?"
17216,Susan,it's not your favorite?
16532,Susan,that's not true. i will get over him.
13719,Susan,"i just wanted to say goodbye to mary alice's house, before somebody else moved in."
14022,Susan,"just so we're clear, you are not allowed to see him anymore."
15192,Susan,"edie, can you--"
13619,Susan,"no.no. i just uh, was wondering your opinion."
16129,Susan,cherry berry?
17090,Susan,the doctor said the baby's fine.
17483,Susan,he's only 5. i don't want him fighting.
14802,Susan,wow.
16420,Susan,mike?
17093,Susan,"it's gonna be okay. i talked to the doctor, and, um, they have a rehab facility they work with."
15387,Susan,"no.no,not really. um--what's the point?"
17776,Susan,"m.j. ,hurry up. your dad's here. hey, katherine. what are you doing here?"
14613,Susan,forbidden!
13968,Susan,"i'm just, you know, busy. stuff."
17466,Susan,i am such a jackass.
14170,Susan,i got to learn to keep my doors locked.
18296,Susan,"oh, shoot. well, can you tell him to call me as soon as he gets back?"
13903,Susan,"no, no really, i'm, i'm sorry you had to go through that. i am."
17254,Susan,"well, after this, we have a big party to go to."
17071,Susan,"no need. i'll be quick. 'cause i'm sure you have a very good reason for giving mike pills when you know that he has a drug problem. so--what is your very good reason? okay, this may take a while. you might want to spit."
15648,Susan,you've gotta be kidding.
17373,Susan,"well, i'm sure she's just upset, and she'll come home after she cools off."
14902,Susan,wow.
15440,Susan,a little?ugh--the helium hasn't even gone out of the balloons from your engagement party.
18273,Susan,"oh, just leave the toilet seat up, and the immigration people will totally think we're married."
17692,Susan,before that.
17041,Susan,look what i found on the dryer. julie won second place in the state science fair.
18163,Susan,how?
14752,Susan,because there are still people at home who care about you and there's things that you need to know.
16630,Susan,i'm so glad we're doing this. i hate it when we fight.
14285,Susan,you're not tired. you took a nap. what is it?
15042,Susan,"oh, carol, you don't have to clean that up. they have clerks for that."
16650,Susan,hey!
18227,Susan,"oh, dave--that does not make it your fault."
14559,Susan,ow! that hurts.
17878,Susan,this is a stupid exercise. i refuse to--
15911,Susan,"oh, right. oh, i wish paul young was still around. he'd know what to do."
13580,Susan,"i don't know what you're talking about, mrs huber."
16855,Susan,"a whole concept, person, um, let's see. shakespeare, book, and then if you do the signal for book. and you touch your heart, then that's poem."
14697,Susan,"she did not pick you. it just didn't occur to her that i would agree to do it. well, now she knows, and if she had it to do over again, she'd pick me."
14595,Susan,"so it occurred to me that i was really rude at the morgue. when you told me about zach, i was so busy freaking out, i never actually congratulated you."
13897,Susan,"well, please. just come on in. uh, mike, i don't think you've officially met my ex, karl mayer."
16156,Susan,"well,obviously,you weren't going to.they needed to know that that dead woman was orson's mistress."
16252,Susan,"oh! no, i wanna, um, keep a low profile."
14482,Susan,"you know, i'm gonna run home and get some milk to go with those doughnuts."
17316,Susan,maybe. who cares! let her have it.
13882,Susan,"well, she was sort of right. after my divorce, i really leaned on her a lot."
15284,Susan,just in passing.
14360,Susan,"of course you can, just call them up and tell them not to come over."
17132,Susan,"no. i'm pregnant, and my husband's in rehab, and the only reason i seem sane is because you're here, making my house feel like a home."
13971,Susan,journals?
15853,Susan,oh. but you're gonna be all right. and i'm gonna help you remember.
14054,Susan,"okay. wow, uh, wow. you know, uh, can you sit down? i need, uh to talk to you."
18384,Susan,"m.j., run!"
15837,Susan,we should've been on the road ten minutes ago.
16942,Susan,"well, i'm voting as a light sleeper. it's right outside our bedroom window. seriously, lynette, it's like living next to splash mountain."
14777,Susan,"okay, who in this room has not committed a felony, raise your hand. ah, ah, ah. not so fast."
16591,Susan,"gosh, i just keep thinking there's someone i've forgotten to tell. caterer, band, florist--"
13846,Susan,am i? hmm.
14443,Susan,"yeah, what did he say?"
15958,Susan,i'm sorry.
14280,Susan,"well, it's true."
14432,Susan,"ah, morty. i just don't think it's going to happen. she's moved on. why don't you sit down, i'll call you a cab."
16120,Susan,you would really get him the best lawyer in town?
17769,Susan,"uh, not good enough. you had a million chances to say something and you didn't. that is just the same as lying to my face. you know, i always thought that the one thing i could depend on you for was honesty. what happened to that?"
15071,Susan,"well, thanks.we appreciate that."
17200,Susan,"well, it was just sort of muttering. were you having a dream about him?"
15920,Susan,"no! no, no! actually, i just, i just had something to tell you."
15166,Susan,i'm curious. um--why were you so congratulatory?
15985,Susan,"yes, and i am grateful, but i found a way to say thank you without taking my top off."
17598,Susan,"no, uh-- it's fantastic."
13806,Susan,"well, open! open, open, open! he could have said something about dana!"
13804,Susan,trouble at work?
15776,Susan,"no, i'm good."
17519,Susan,"well, i thought i had you beaten today, and next think i knew, i was eating grass."
14316,Susan,"mom, don't go. mom, come back. i need to. we're good, right?"
13570,Susan,"no. no, no, not at all."
18284,Susan,yeah. he was on board when he found out there was cake.
14319,Susan,she said she won't come in until you go out and apologise to her.
15371,Susan,ohh!
15684,Susan,you really think that's what's gonna happen?
14715,Susan,"you come within 10 feet of her,i will have you arrested.now get out."
14932,Susan,"oh. i hope that's not just because of us not being us anymore. i mean, we could be together at a wedding and it wouldn't have to be weird."
13392,Susan,oh. great.
14596,Susan,"i know how much you've always wanted a child, and now you have one."
16230,Susan,no. what about them?
14826,Susan,"oh, my god. paul."
16359,Susan,"what i'm trying to say is, there'll be no topic that i need to--skirt. no issue that i won't--address. i won't conceal my true thoughts under garments of secrecy."
16505,Susan,"okay, fine, i loved him. i still love him, and i love ian. so i am totally, hopelessly in love with two men."
16690,Susan,yeah.
14130,Susan,"now? well, i'm, i'm sorry, my daughter and i were going to go see a movie tonight."
14104,Susan,"he was embarrassed. he said it was an accident. oh, don't look at me like that. accidents happen."
17728,Susan,yeah! he went in there to find you.
16779,Susan,psst! come here.
17327,Susan,"oh. well, yeah, um, i mean, ""conner"" we just picked it after the senior. this would mean something."
17239,Susan,yeah.
14872,Susan,"i just think if i start acting like an adult for once, maybe, who knows, somewhere down the line, mike and i at least can be friends."
15860,Susan,"yeah! see how much fun we were? so i dragged you out onto the dance floor, and, well, you were giving me this look--sort of like the look you're giving me right now--and, um, i started to do this--and then you did this--"
14291,Susan,i'm sorry.
18424,Susan,"i'm having trouble with the family across the street. i think one of them may have set a fire in my house, and i don't know why, but i feel like it might have something to do with my friend who killed herself. i called the police, but they didn't take me seriously. this family has a secret, a bad secret. i think i'm in over my head. i need you to find out everything you can about paul young and his family. do you think you can help me?"
14466,Susan,"hi, kendra."
18176,Susan,"look, travers, we're all moms here. we've all made mistakes with our kids, and what we count on is when they grow up, they'll forgive us."
14661,Susan,"edie, come back here! we're not finished yet!"
15442,Susan,"well,isn't it?"
13339,Susan,tell me again why i fought for custody of you?
17825,Susan,oh!
13621,Susan,you don't have to explain.
16876,Susan,"hey, neighbor!"
16089,Susan,"there's an explanation for this, and we're gonna figure it out. don't worry about a thing."
14844,Susan,"well, that's comforting to know there's a silver lining."
16745,Susan,i'm pregnant?
18083,Susan,"you know, i-i think you may have gotten the wrong impression. i'm not--into women."
16329,Susan,were you also thinking of getting her a lace bra?
15488,Susan,"get out of my house,you miserable son of a bitch!"
17626,Susan,susan. jackson's girlfriend.
16672,Susan,what are you doing?
17142,Susan,"yeah, i was sorry to hear about your job. you know, ever since n.a.f.t.a., corporate outsourcing has been the bane of the american worker. is that right? i heard somebody say that on n.p.r., and i just keep repeating it to people."
13924,Susan,"well, here's something. mike told me he loved me."
17579,Susan,"so obviously, this is the bedroom."
13595,Susan,"i tried! but they sort of laughed at me, because apparently nothing was taken from mrs fome's house."
17363,Susan,tuesday? what are you talking about?
16728,Susan,"yeah,the part before death. oh!"
14587,Susan,"oh, my god."
14414,Susan,are you okay?
14910,Susan,"oh, julie."
18118,Susan,"okay, will someone call guinness? because you just set the world record for the biggest load of crap in one sentence."
13316,Susan,"you'll love this, he said it doesn't mean anything, it was just sex."
15136,Susan,symptoms?
15135,Susan,"oh,are you sure?um,because i would look a lot better over the phone right now."
17458,Susan,oh. is his name mike delfino? did you room together at liars' college?
14991,Susan,what? i just got here.
14746,Susan,how?
17521,Susan,this is nice. we should rumble all the time.
18114,Susan,"it's a head, and he's stabbing someone with a sword."
13338,Susan,"you're right. so, is that your project for school? you know in 5th grade i made the white house out of sugar cubes."
14149,Susan,is julie in there? julie mayer?
15577,Susan,"a tad?edie, i have no roof!you can't just go around burning down people's homes."
14256,Susan,"i mean, one minute we're making out in his truck and the next thing i know, we're at the hospital and the doctor's digging a bullet out of him. it's just that when i started dating mike, he seemed like such a normal guy, you know?"
15607,Susan,what?no!
15283,Susan,i'm checking myself into the hospital.i'm finally gonna get that surgery.
17967,Susan,"damn right, ""oh"".what happened to ""i'm broke and can't afford to send m.j. to private school""?"
13535,Susan,what's that?
17745,Susan,"i'm not, but now you have to tell me who she is. fine. have it your way. oh, if he ever needs a transfusion, you are not allowed to give him my blood."
16800,Susan,"oh, my god! i'm not a stripper."
14240,Susan,"edie! edie, why can't i go out with him?"
13352,Susan,"here, here, look. put in this peanut butter. and this cooking oil. and these olives!"
15800,Susan,ian!
18418,Susan,"hey, mike, it's me. are you there? pick up. hello? okay, i know you're home. your lights are on. look, i really need to talk to you about something, uh, you know what? i'm just gonna stop by."
14030,Susan,"anyway, you won't even know i'm there."
13611,Susan,"okay, fine i'll go out with you."
15338,Susan,"i did?oh, is that why you han't been in to see me since my surgery?"
18402,Susan,"dave, please. please. i cannot imagine the pain you went through, but you can't do this. you can't kill my little boy!"
16947,Susan,katherine.
15791,Susan,"me, too. so was that, uh, okay?"
13668,Susan,"great. speaking of zach, i haven't seen him around lately."
17545,Susan,you could've walked away.
16150,Susan,it's me again. you should also know that orson spent a year in an asylum.
18035,Susan,"yes, and we talked all about it. she loves it."
16936,Susan,"ida, again, the issue is not bob and lee being gay. it's the fountain."
17535,Susan,"oh, my god. this is about m.j.'s drawing, isn't it?"
15374,Susan,"okay,mike,just--it's okay.just go home."
15262,Susan,"you mean,like,marriage?"
14108,Susan,will you just call?
17854,Susan,jackson has made it pretty clear that he doesn't do good with long-distance relationships. i could lose him.
14765,Susan,"really? ah, i think it might be rude not to. lonnie, what's going on?"
17499,Susan,"oh! wait. your forgot your whistle. okay, sweetie. this is just to be on the safe side. if juanita comes around, you just blow it. i'll be right there."
14043,Susan,zach was telling julie about what happened to dana.
16131,Susan,down to the jailhouse to talk to mike.
16167,Susan,things are different now! i-i love you! you--you don't have to worry about that anymore. if we're gonna make this relationship work then you have to trust me and why are you smiling at me?
15052,Susan,"okay, one more."
13501,Susan,"don't worry, i'm not packing heat. hi."
16100,Susan,"but mike is in jail, and you said yourself you thought orson did it."
15805,Susan,"what is this, the gallup poll?!"
17839,Susan,"will you stop guessing? oh, god! why won't i just let myself be happy?"
13921,Susan,"actually, you're coming to the party tomorrow. and that's the end of it."
17440,Susan,"well, i do. we need a shirt that says, ""i'm a responsible citizen,"" not ""my favorite clothing store also sells bongs."""
16274,Susan,"andrew, what are you doing at the hospital?"
14987,Susan,mr. prudy. hello.
16572,Susan,you don't even know me. how dare you talk to me like that?
16991,Susan,"well, you're wrong. he's happy. he's got a good job and a wife who loves him and a baby on the way."
18303,Susan,good news. looks like we're getting fake married after all.
13625,Susan,so what's going on there?
17952,Susan,what about that big job you just did for the last three months? what did you do with that money?
13323,Susan,"gabby, the woman killed herself. something must've been going on."
13550,Susan,"paul, are you going to be alright?"
14201,Susan,you said he was going to be gone.
16142,Susan,hello?
16729,Susan,"yes,it is! what if you wanna have kids?"
14370,Susan,"oh, i'm embarrassing you."
14866,Susan,you walked out on me.
17112,Susan,"well, i drove all the way out there, and i waited for hours and then they wouldn't let me see him. uh, no. they just said that i should--i should call you. listen, i know it's a 30-day rehab. i'm not trying to break him out. i'm just trying to see him. you know what? could you just call me when you know? thank you."
15066,Susan,and he doesn't want you anywhere near him.
16060,Susan,"ian, you don't have to do that."
15679,Susan,"okay, that's ridiculous. karl doesn't have me wrapped around anything."
16435,Susan,"no. no, i'm gonna go with the crab cakes and the little quesadillas. well, all we need is a wedding cake, and we're done."
16588,Susan,will you marry me?
15876,Susan,"julie, there you are. i think i found a way to get through to mike."
16200,Susan,"don't worry, i'm not gonna get mad. just sit down. you know what upset me the most? that you didn't trust me enough to tell me the truth."
17170,Susan,"oh, nice try, timmy. like i'm really going to believe that. shame on you. just-- shame! what do you mean, ""old feelings""?"
17568,Susan,hi.
18228,Susan,"you can't think that way. i mean, what happened is bad enough. y-- you can't blame yourself for it, too. if you do that, you will destroy everything you have left that's good. trust me. i know."
16802,Susan,if that's your lame attempt to keep me from calling your parents--it worked. well played. excuse me.
14914,Susan,why do you think we got so good all of a sudden?
14827,Susan,why--are you doing here?
16774,Susan,"oh, my god. bree, that is, like, the best pie you've ever made."
17343,Susan,"oh. uh--okay. i'm just gonna level with you. my husband picked the name, and i think it's horrible, and i know over time, he's gonna agree."
17436,Susan,"well, when you meet him for the second time, you can tell him that. he's picking you up here tomorrow night."
15529,Susan,"okay,um--first of all,it was not the best sex i ever had.i just said that to make him feel better.obviously,you were the best sex i ever had."
13672,Susan,no. that's why we have to find him. it's the only way we'll know the truth.
17766,Susan,you knew about katherine and mike?
16272,Susan,for the sake of our friendship--
17670,Susan,no. it's sex time!
14396,Susan,i won't . i promise.
16318,Susan,"oh, not that chair. that's the wobbler. i'm saving up for a new set. here, sit here."
17129,Susan,"well, i guess i'll just bring this pie up to julie."
14273,Susan,"yeah, you really did. so let's go call the insurance company."
14148,Susan,julie? mommy needs a hug. julie?
18417,Susan,"thank you, zach. you have just made this really easy for me. you are now forbidden from seeing or talking my daughter ever again! and if you come within ten feet of her, i will call the police, and i will have you arrested! now get out!"
15706,Susan,"oh, wow.um, um, i can't accept this.this is too extravagant."
14730,Susan,"you know, edie, could you just back off? i mean the truth is we're probably never gonna find zach, anyway. it's a needle in a haystack."
15901,Susan,"uh, a little. i-- just, the last time we saw each other, it was so awkward and complicated."
15951,Susan,"yeah, i wanna believe that, but suddenly you're having boys over, you're drinking beer--"
14601,Susan,"no. no, i'm so sorry. i'll, i'll, um, i'll see you around."
14521,Susan,"oh, my god. where have you been?"
14112,Susan,i said no.
17842,Susan,"yes. uh, we had a very nice, uneventful evening. why? what did he say? 'cause he was pretty drunk, so he was--probably making stuff up."
16146,Susan,"bree, hi. sorry about that. damn telemarketer. so what can i do for you?"
17066,Susan,you did? when?
17249,Susan,"karl? is he here? oh, what a freakish--"
17115,Susan,"oh, my god! i want to eat that."
17601,Susan,i gave romance a shot and--i'm ready for something a little more casual.
17639,Susan,may i ask who's calling?
14568,Susan,"just work it into the conversation. you know, put the word out there."
14629,Susan,"oh, it's fine. they're in the garage."
14876,Susan,"thanks. that's great. 'cause if you decided to hang on to my joni mitchell cds i'd have to come after you with a club. you're right, it's not funny. actually, i did want to see if you were aware that you gave me back the valentine's day card that i made you."
13758,Susan,"hey, bongo, come here. you want a treat? hey, mike, where do you keep the dog biscuits?"
15345,Susan,"oh, yeah, that's the plan.i swear."
14171,Susan,"i don't know. five minutes, give or take three hours."
16426,Susan,kiss me.
14078,Susan,"it's kind of important, um, yeah i guess it can wait. so i'll see you at seven?"
16970,Susan,thank you.
16711,Susan,sure.i'm just here for a checkup.
14483,Susan,"well, i can't have doughnuts and juice. it's unnatural."
18393,Susan,"well, you won't get away with it. mike already called the cops. they're on their way."
18245,Susan,"jackson, hey. you're back."
17309,Susan,"well, it happens."
17963,Susan,i have been naked on this street. it would be nice to take the heat off that story.
14614,Susan,"well, i just bet she is!"
16061,Susan,you have to kiss me. it's the law.
14208,Susan,"no, of course i don't believe that, but i also didn't believe that karl was going to cheat on me, and i didn't believe that mary alice was gonna kill herself. i mean, let's face it, mike -- blind faith is not my friend."
14301,Susan,okay girls.
13479,Susan,"yeah, well, my heart wants to hurt you, but i can control myself."
16540,Susan,"hey, carlos! wait. hi. look, there's some crazy rumor going around that mike moved."
13521,Susan,"well, i guess i've done my good deed for the day."
17295,Susan,"well, you could see how i, as the nude, snoring whore, would think so."
15363,Susan,"karl!oh, god!"
17645,Susan,okay.
18434,Susan,"well, all of the food is very expensive."
13590,Susan,noway.
14147,Susan,"stop! stop mike, just stop. if you keep talking, you're gonna work your way into my heart and i just don't want you anywhere near my heart. ever."
15065,Susan,i thought you'd be happy about it.i thought that's what you wanted.
14040,Susan,i have a little confession to make.
17543,Susan,yeah. you know what i learned? mike is on his way over here to teach his son how to ride the bike he bought--something he was looking forward to until you ruined it.
18193,Susan,sometimes it's the stove's fault.
18326,Susan,"well--i'll miss you, too. i mean, you came in my life when i was going through a really hard time, and you were amazing. i mean, you are amazing."
17173,Susan,"i don't want to hear this. i'm done with both of you. if anybody needs me, i'll be at the mall--buying sheets."
17875,Susan,edie--
15426,Susan,"karl,this marriage--our marriage,this fake marriage,that's what it is,right?fake."
18340,Susan,"well, somebody did, because he sent me a text agreeing to keep paying me alimony."
17852,Susan,i'm getting there.
17455,Susan,"this is-- i mean, i'm just--i have been violated."
15931,Susan,susan.
15069,Susan,zach.
18050,Susan,"it is, actually, because that is when i decided that i don't want this piece of art that i slaved over hanging in the house you are sharing with your new girlfriend. capisce?"
18199,Susan,yeah. look what it did to us.
14415,Susan,i'm so sorry.
17643,Susan,sounds great. pick me up at 7:00.
16121,Susan,"well, okay then. you know, mike barely remembers me. what makes you so sure he would fall in love with me again?"
17340,Susan,hello. i need to change the name on my baby's birth certificate.
15188,Susan,"she makes it sound like we're angry, and we're not angry."
15159,Susan,okay.
16273,Susan,you doing okay?
18213,Susan,"okay. you have a realtor coming, right? you cannot let him see the house in this condition. so just let me clean up a little. you won't even know i'm here."
18128,Susan,why?
16130,Susan,"oh, i so did not need to know that."
16837,Susan,"oh, i can talk him into it. what's his name?"
14282,Susan,i think i would have given up entirely if it weren't for you and morty.
13887,Susan,"well, um, he's got a smile that's to die for, and don't get me started on his tattoo."
17284,Susan,"you know, i think, actually, i might have those dough hooks somewhere."
15934,Susan,i'd love to go to france someday.
13429,Susan,here's your dessert.
13326,Susan,"yeah, i get that a lot. here you go."
13845,Susan,"oh, how awful!"
14885,Susan,so am i allowed to ask what happened?
15558,Susan,"all right,you go ahead and be coy. fine.i'll be the one to break the ice.i've never stopped caring about you."
14380,Susan,oh! oh! how did you get down there? that's not funny.
14223,Susan,i think this is yours.
14943,Susan,"oh, well, yeah, i thought you probably did. so i checked that, too, and he wasn't there and so i called the v.a., and there is not a single record of anyone named harrison ross in vietnam."
13852,Susan,you are just the sweetest guy.
18132,Susan,here's a thought. why don't we talk about edie?
16228,Susan,"um, no, actually, i'm a friend of ian's. he asked me to come--for jane."
16563,Susan,"no, seriously, i was asking. what would you have done?"
17084,Susan,"uh, i think i just twisted my ankle, but i would like to get checked out anyway."
14452,Susan,"if you find out something that's really bad, just try and put a positive spin on it."
17213,Susan,"in honor of you coming home, we are making your favorite meal - steak and mashed potatoes."
14195,Susan,"no, something happened in this house, something so awful we can't even imagine it."
17105,Susan,and i will help her.
16886,Susan,"oh, look, i made a terrible first impression, so i thought i'd make them some of my home-baked goodness."
14402,Susan,yeah.
16484,Susan,don't soft-pedal it. let 'em know i mean business.
15845,Susan,"ian, i'm, i'm sorry. i know how you feel. it's mike. it's my mike."
17873,Susan,of course i have.
17708,Susan,no. why?
15280,Susan,thanks.i owe you one.
13977,Susan,"what, you think there's a chance mrs. huber didn't write about it in the journal?"
15512,Susan,"okay, let's not make a scene.it's not worth it.for the sake of argument,let's--let's--let's say that it's someone else.you know, probably it would be a vulnerable, lonely woman who karl just took advantage of,and what if--this poor, confused soul begged your forgiveness?what would you say?"
15328,Susan,"oh,it means a lot to me that you came."
15061,Susan,uh--oh!
14796,Susan,"no, i can't."
17685,Susan,"oh! look at my little girl. isn't she adorable? oh, i missed her so much."
14750,Susan,i swear.
14021,Susan,"you're not going, you're going to stay here and talk about this."
18221,Susan,you're gonna feel really silly when you hear what it is.
17428,Susan,it's not really a good time.
13954,Susan,oh my god. this is so wonderful!
16304,Susan,"oh, no, th--"
16973,Susan,"great. uh, diabetes?"
13952,Susan,you want me back?
17226,Susan,so you don't know that your husband tried to kill mike?
16395,Susan,"i think if you really like this guy, you should just be honest. you should tell him that you feel a little hurt--"
16590,Susan,there. i think i left messages for everyone. are you sure it's okay for us to have the same wedding i was planning with ian? be honest.
13531,Susan,"um, sure. as a friend."
16957,Susan,nice save. now can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong with my baby?
13731,Susan,"oh, well, yeah, we, we did, uh, i just thought she left."
15568,Susan,who would wanna burn down my house?
16176,Susan,why were you two talking about condoms?
16740,Susan,i'm in here.
18370,Susan,this sounds really---
17659,Susan,blocked?
15081,Susan,"zach,i'm glad you could make it."
17526,Susan,look what he did with my hair. i kind of like the bangs.
15196,Susan,"i don't need a loan.i need coverage.i mean, what if there are complications?i don't have a safety net.oh, my god, please!"
16241,Susan,"actually, yeah, there is."
17979,Susan,congratulations on getting me out of your office.
17467,Susan,"well, i was pretty ticked off that you told jackson about the ear thing."
13763,Susan,"and then i opened the cabinet and there was all this money in it. i mean, there was wads of it."
16760,Susan,katherine? are you okay? you seem a little jumpy.
17711,Susan,"oh, i just love this song. and jackson doesn't like to dance, so--isn't this fun?"
16726,Susan,no.i'm sorry.i'm just a little--you know what? forget it.let's eat.
16127,Susan,"no, but it's a piece of the puzzle. i mean, he did have an affair with her. and when you combine that with the fact that his first wife went missing--"
14805,Susan,of course. you're my lonnie.
14779,Susan,really? so that's it with you. you just get one shot and you screw up and you're out. i didn't know you were such a cynic.
16640,Susan,that's good to know.
16037,Susan,"yeah, rupe, i hope we can be good friends, 'cause you're gonna be seeing lots more of me."
14166,Susan,or just come on in.
17795,Susan,hi.
15260,Susan,what?
17479,Susan,and your shirt is ripped. that's the second time this week. is someone picking on you? who is it?
17698,Susan,"yeah. only twice. two. small number. much smaller than three. and my first cheated on me, so that doesn't even count."
15613,Susan,"oh, ah."
13661,Susan,that's a guy not a band.
14159,Susan,"no, no, no. now, i know how much you were looking forward to this weekend with your dad. i'm fine."
15490,Susan,"our marriage was garbage!stupid,disgusting pile of garbage!"
15890,Susan,"yeah, now. look, you gotta understand. the doctors were telling me that you would probably never wake up, and i just needed somebody to talk to.mike: and that's what you were doing in the country, talking?"
16279,Susan,"oh, my god. does this have something to do with orson's accident?"
16715,Susan,okay.
15514,Susan,yeah.
17870,Susan,gotta get out. i'm supposed to be meeting the moving company. what?
15692,Susan,"oh, shut up."
14514,Susan,i'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
14682,Susan,"well, i played in high school."
18122,Susan,"amy, that is very sweet. i love the colors you used. oh, danielle, that is just beautiful. evan, that is very pretty. you did the assignment just like i asked. good job!"
14254,Susan,"see now. maybe it's the word ""date"" that's throwing me off."
14849,Susan,"well, he's not here."
15690,Susan,"you would think so, but, no, it doesn't."
14110,Susan,"uh, dinner, tonight?"
17462,Susan,like you don't know-- jackson.
16646,Susan,so what do you think?
18120,Susan,"shut up, karl."
16530,Susan,"what? but just ten minutes ago, we were making plans, and you were saying how great we were gonna be together."
17192,Susan,"no, no, no, no. no, i did not have a sex dream."
13350,Susan,now? you wanna come over now? y-you have company.
13677,Susan,"yes, i think so. i learned in college. it's like riding a bike, right?"
14002,Susan,"edie, please talk to me."
14004,Susan,"well, whatever you want to do, edie, just know that i'm sorry."
16997,Susan,"there's no way out of it, mike. just do what you need and downstairs. this is what we do in the suburbs."
14881,Susan,who is it?
17308,Susan,thank you. do you wanna go back in there right now and tell her?
17336,Susan,"i know. it's terrible, but i can't change it now. mike was so emotional about it."
13715,Susan,"oh, here it is."
14418,Susan,what?
17228,Susan,"and the worst part--all this time, you pretended to be our friend."
15629,Susan,"oh yes! my god, i have a genius baby!!"
14318,Susan,mom. i brought her over.
16458,Susan,"no, i know what they taste like. i'm just torn, okay?"
16112,Susan,"uh, bree and i sort of had a fight. look, i'm awfully sorry that i'm late. i had an emergency."
16713,Susan,"i-i didn't know you were,this kind of doctor."
18019,Susan,what?
17427,Susan,fine.
14423,Susan,"oh oh oh, my, look! my kitchen! oh, it's a big fire!"
15103,Susan,it's my mental health.my mental health!you took an oath.
16353,Susan,really? i think it's about someone else. he just wanted me to help him remember something.
15049,Susan,you don't have to do this.
14307,Susan,"well, you don't have a place to live. you don't like to work. i mean, you didn't want to marry morty, so he doesn't have to pay you alimony. i- i- it's just if you don't go back to this man who allegedly shoved you once in five years, what are your options?"
15438,Susan,you mauled me in edie's bed last night.i think that deserves a conversation.
18364,Susan,"oh, sweetie. you just had one, and we don't want to have to stop ten times so you can go to the bathroom."
15701,Susan,you might think i'm naive but i know he's coming back to me.
17039,Susan,"oh, barrett, i wasn't fishing for compliments. if i was--i would've shown you this one."
13663,Susan,"i'm sorry, could you repeat that?"
14599,Susan,"and out of all the mixed-up teenagers in the world, zach is just the one kid that i can't be around. i can't have julie around him. so, um, what i'm trying to say is--"
15942,Susan,"well, a simple no, i didn't drink any beer' would've sufficed."
16899,Susan,what's going on?
14993,Susan,"it's, it's susan. my name is susan. and, no, that's not good enough."
16028,Susan,is the coast clear? i don't wanna flash the help again.
14160,Susan,well--i'm a little sad. mike and i were just a fling. and not even a full fling. sort of a borderline fling.
18141,Susan,"so is it just you, or do you have a family?"
16464,Susan,you bet me in a game of poker?
14006,Susan,thank you.
13791,Susan,do you mean that?
13752,Susan,"sounds like a job. so, julie said that you came by before?"
15861,Susan,"oh, mike. come on, you're not even trying to remember! it was fun! oh, i know. okay, sing with me. car wash, talkin' about the car wash. whoo, car wash, yeah."
15031,Susan,"this is ridiculous. what does she think, we're having an affair?"
14193,Susan,"do you believe in evil, edie?"
17046,Susan,"hey, that kid, um, barrett came by today."
17747,Susan,"gaby, please. most women would kill to look like you."
16467,Susan,"you, too. i've had it with both of you. you're tugging at me like i'm some kind of wishbone."
14413,Susan,are you okay?
17366,Susan,"but it's a huge honor. yes, we've established that. it's huge. it's an honor. we get it."
13923,Susan,"yeah, people fake their own abductions all the time."
16937,Susan,"hear, hear."
14701,Susan,i'm busy now.
15710,Susan,so you asked us to a meal to announce another meal?that's so bree of you.
15832,Susan,i thought you said you didn't get reception up here.
15486,Susan,she doesn't know?
15423,Susan,this is your father's bartender bible.see if you can find a recipe for a rusty nail.
17353,Susan,shh!
13772,Susan,"hello! i need help, i'm up here, i'm trapped in the floor, hello?!"
17633,Susan,"sorry, bad time. i have the mailman upstairs in my tub."
16820,Susan,yeah. got it.
16231,Susan,what?
17777,Susan,"of course. why wouldn't it be okay? i think it's--great. really, really great."
17977,Susan,"look, i know i said that m.j. was a star student, but the truth is, he's one of those kids that needs extra attention. the classes at his school are way too big, and i see him getting lost in the shuffle. and if he gets lost now--my ex-husband is doing everything that he can, and i need to know that i am, too. i will serve lunches. i will be a janitor. anything. but i am not walking out on my son's future."
14659,Susan,"no, i won't!"
13328,Susan,yeah i'm very big with the under 5 set. what do you do?
17933,Susan,"hey, i am happy for you. it's just, uh--this is gonna sound crazy."
16692,Susan,"and just so you know, you'll be paying for those and the lights and the flowers."
15231,Susan,i still don't have insurance.i need to get that operation.i'm--i'm really screwed.
17589,Susan,are we doing the right thing here?
16555,Susan,"two days? well, can't i just drive part of the way and then hike from there?"
17649,Susan,"yes. we're starting completely over, so this time, we're gonna do things right."
15217,Susan,"oh, yeah.no, i'm sorry.l-- that was really-- it."
17406,Susan,what are you doing here?
14891,Susan,"well, these days anybody going through a break-up gets my sympathy."
17489,Susan,that's not just any girl. you saw her. she could take down a small deer.
17858,Susan,"well, maybe i can help you. think you can rent my house out?"
16382,Susan,saying what?
16567,Susan,"well, i wanted to look nice for mike."
17723,Susan,"hey, jackson. where are you going? the guys are about to start."
18170,Susan,we don't have time for this. anybody know how to change a tire?
14468,Susan,but mike's lawyer pleaded self defence and if that's the case-
13899,Susan,"yeah, we're going to a restaurant downtown. a guy who plays piano and an open mike. julie got a bunch of her girlfriends together, so we're just going to make a night of it."
14550,Susan,i look like hell. i need a hairbrush.
17177,Susan,so-- this man-- who do you think it was?
17879,Susan,lunch. it was lunch.
13603,Susan,okay.
18119,Susan,"this is nothing, mr. hobson. we were just having a difference of opinion."
15732,Susan,his wife vanished and he didn't even tell bree. how much more proof do you need?
17335,Susan,"okay, drop the act, ladies. i hate it, too. mike insisted that we name him after his dead grandfather."
15553,Susan,"tu-tuesday?no,no,tuesday's not good,'cause tuesday's the day i,um--become a lesbian."
16238,Susan,"i'm gonna put the phone up to jane's ear, and you can tell her whatever you need to, okay?"
18380,Susan,just hold on a few more minutes.
17057,Susan,that's a relief.
17922,Susan,i didn't.
16193,Susan,"is this dr. marvin tashman? hi. my name is susan mayer. um, my daughter julie came in to see you--yes, about birth control. so i'm just curious--where do you get off prescribing that without my consent?! what?! no, i most certainly was not there. what do i look like? i don't have blonde hair."
18112,Susan,"evan, that's-- kind of a scary picture."
13584,Susan,"good evening, mrs huber."
16546,Susan,"okay, julie, i'm out of here. here's forty bucks on the counter."
13404,Susan,right.
16632,Susan,"well, you know, when i married him, karl wasn't karl. and i think that's why i got so mad at you. because ninety-nine percent of me is sure that we're gonna be totally happy. but then what you said--it just stirred up that pesky one percent."
15972,Susan,right.
16255,Susan,oops. watch yourself.
16363,Susan,i saw you watching us.we were just talking.
14548,Susan,"not so tough now, are you?"
14326,Susan,why?
15622,Susan,you know what would be nice?why don't you just stop over for coffee sometime?
16769,Susan,mike. i'm going with mike.
13608,Susan,oh wow.
16237,Susan,you've done everything you could. she knows that you love her.
16358,Susan,"i mean it. i am going to be loving and faithful and above all, honest. there'll be no secrets with ian. i'll tell him everything."
16248,Susan,"okay, yes, it'll be weird. but it's not about me. this is about jane and ian. what if i wore this one?"
14439,Susan,did she tell you that he served time in prison for manslaughter?
17389,Susan,amazing.
14323,Susan,"well, even so!"
16552,Susan,why not?
14754,Susan,what?
17899,Susan,i won't.
16022,Susan,"all right, oh--but let's make it a quickie 'cause you are wasting water."
17119,Susan,"oh, none taken."
13653,Susan,i cannot believe julie sent you. she is soon going to be dead.
15184,Susan,and i am so sorry about that-- snap thing.i was just trying to be theatrical.
16847,Susan,why not?
16994,Susan,"oh, yeah!"
18140,Susan,"oh, yeah. i saw the moving van. welcome."
18409,Susan,"okay. just stop talking. john, how old are you?"
15376,Susan,"ron,what are you doing?"
17798,Susan,what is that supposed to mean?
18077,Susan,"oh, that would be way too awkward. she's my boss."
14964,Susan,all this time my father has been right across town running the feed store?
13483,Susan,and then i fell. so how are you?
15988,Susan,"yeah? well, i choose to ground you. two weeks, baby."
13793,Susan,"lynette, it's just, this really isn't the time--"
18330,Susan,"what's he gonna do with that, watch bruce lee movies without the subtitles?"
16748,Susan,hey!is something wrong?
13366,Susan,mike!
15059,Susan,what kiss?
17857,Susan,so he was married before. you don't kick a man out for that.
13324,Susan,"oh, i wouldn't eat that if i were you."
17357,Susan,wow. i didn't know about that.
15730,Susan,then why the rush?
18143,Susan,funny and likes to gossip. we're gonna get along just fine.
17299,Susan,"i don't know what to tell you, mama. look at me. aah!"
13680,Susan,"oh, that's right, the twins-stage debut!"
13953,Susan,wow. just so we're clear. you want to move back in here and be faithful to me and love me with all your heart and soul?
14778,Susan,"well, it's possible because i have faith in people. i mean, lonnie knows he messed up and he's sorry. he's making restitution. what, you don't believe people deserve second chances?"
15968,Susan,"this is susan mayer-- again. first of all, i'm sorry for the ""crazy lady"" remark. second, i have a proposition for you."
16931,Susan,"yeah, they can get like that. so do you think that you can just turn it off for a second?"
17446,Susan,thank you. now go shave. you look like a hobo.
14438,Susan,"she did, huh?"
16940,Susan,"uh, it's not like i'm pro- katherine. i'm just anti-fountain. oh, don't give me that look. i made her a promise."
15099,Susan,"dr. mccready,can i talk to you about my head?away from--the draft?"
16223,Susan,thank you! this is a noble thing you're doing.
16580,Susan,"mike, what day is today?"
15963,Susan,"yeah, but there's a crazy woman in there!"
14253,Susan,"oh, god, no. no! you are just so incredibly not hideous."
14051,Susan,she's in the shower.
17616,Susan,we had an agreement to keep things casual.
16627,Susan,you don't have to.
15160,Susan,"oh! mmm.okay, that sort of felt unethical."
16044,Susan,did you consider removing the body?
15117,Susan,he's young.
14031,Susan,"well, not too much. julie, you know you can tell me anything, right?"
17095,Susan,"oh, my god. are you kidding me?"
13904,Susan,uh--
17871,Susan,so now me wanting to be with the man i love is stupid?
18076,Susan,"okay, i'm probably just blowing this out of proportion. i mean, she never even said anything about being gay."
17613,Susan,"we should probably talk now, huh?"
15357,Susan,yeah.
15102,Susan,"that man is the most obnoxious,offensive,annoying human being.and you're looking at me like i'm crazy right now,but i will be if i spend one more second with him.so you gotta help me.you gotta do something."
13490,Susan,"well, you're probably not wearing the right shoes."
16177,Susan,"don't change the subject. are you two having sex? because i thought that i raised you to be smarter than that. don't you realize that sex is not fun and games? it's dangerous. every time you turn around, there's a new disease. do you want it to burn when you pee?"
14944,Susan,"well, i'm sorry to upset you, mom, i just, don't you think that's weird?"
17155,Susan,i'm having a baby. i can't give birth with brittle bones. go!
13361,Susan,edie? hello..?
15941,Susan,"okay, i know i--and don't play the parent card with me."
16865,Susan,"it's okay. i just wanna know what's going on. ever since you've been pregnant, there's been this wall between us. it's like something's changed, and i don't know why. did i do something to offend you?"
15499,Susan,"yes, like you wouldn't believe."
17402,Susan,"hey, anytime that you need to talk, you just ring my bell--and wait."
16655,Susan,yeah.
17447,Susan,"you guys were insulting each other. that's good, right?"
18149,Susan,yeah?
13853,Susan,"no, me neither."
17945,Susan,seriously?
15436,Susan,i just saw edie drive off.how long is she gonna be gone?
15047,Susan,"so, you are hereby released of any further obligation to be my dad."
18280,Susan,"no, no. it's okay. i wanna do this. truth is--i miss you, and the house has been kinda lonely since you left."
16077,Susan,"his wife goes missing, then his mistress turns up dead. what is there to think about?"
18056,Susan,"now as you listen to the music, see what pops into your head. what shapes does it make you see? what colors are you thinking of?"
13919,Susan,"okay, the analysis part of this evening is now over."
16789,Susan,mike!
13410,Susan,"i just wanted to come by and say hello, you know, see how you guys are doing."
17131,Susan,"well, yeah, sure, someday, but right now i just love having you take care of me. all the cooking and the cleaning and the alphabetizing--it's helping me feel like i'm not just about to fall apart."
17498,Susan,you know what? maybe you could teach your daughter how to use her words and not her fists.
13405,Susan,"oh, no, no. no, edie's definitely a carnivore."
16716,Susan,"it's just that it's weird,you know,considering you're--where'd you go?"
16883,Susan,"raphael is your dog, of course. you know, 'cause you folks can't have kids. i mean, uh, i mean, of course you can have kids, um, you--you know, because times have changed, and now you're allowed. what a-- nice dog. i should go."
17445,Susan,"he could take me to court, and the judge can make me choose between you and my son. and i'm sorry. you will lose."
18082,Susan,thanks. i was thinking about the other night--
16586,Susan,"oh, my god. i can't believe that you did this."
16139,Susan,"good.uh, his name is orson hodge, and he had an affair with the woman that you think mike delfino killed."
16148,Susan,"oh, uh--sure."
14869,Susan,"actually, i think i'm starting to feel pretty zen about the whole thing."
16397,Susan,"well, that's okay. you gotta work, you gotta work. so, um--i was thinking about london. julie's gonna be applying to college as soon, and, um, a year abroad could give her a real boost. so--let's do it."
16244,Susan,good luck with everything.
14681,Susan,i play the piano. you know that.
13371,Susan,what does this mean?
13937,Susan,yeah. he's a great guy.
18349,Susan,"yeah. that and, uh--i don't know. it d-did kind of come out of nowhere."
16171,Susan,you--you--you can't kiss me now. i'm yelling at you.
16647,Susan,no. i'm screwed. i cannot get out of this without hurting her feelings.
14143,Susan,"no, he didn't. he was with me and mike wouldn't kill anybody. i'm sure of that."
14356,Susan,"mom, i don't hate you."
17108,Susan,"how do you say no to someone in need? that wasn't rhetorical. seriously, you got anything?"
14858,Susan,yes. mike.
14416,Susan,but you know what they say about kids: that you can't imagine having them until you do and then you can't imagine life without them? it's true.
14579,Susan,"he held a gun to my face, so i'm thinking, good."
13618,Susan,and i sort of said yes. i was sort of curious what you thought about that.
14889,Susan,you finally saw her without her makeup?
17054,Susan,he bought those pills a long time ago and never got around to paying the guy.
17100,Susan,"okay, lynette, listen to me. they are all going to be fine. i know it."
18305,Susan,and unbelievably generous. i'm gonna send him a thank-you right now.
13710,Susan,old friend?
16440,Susan,"well, there's this guy coming to dinner, and he is single and handsome and charming and--"
16179,Susan,what?
13991,Susan,do you need help with the container?
16454,Susan,"maggie, these cakes are fantastic."
17838,Susan,"just a friend. oh, gaby, do you think i did this subconsciously just to sabotage my relationship with jackson?"
17683,Susan,really?
16989,Susan,i should go.
15887,Susan,"well, yeah, i've been known to take a spill or two, but, you know, my doctor says it's an inner ear--wait, you remember that?"
13931,Susan,i don't think so.
16207,Susan,don't you love this guy? what's the strategy?
16955,Susan,thanks for everything. thank you.
15886,Susan,"i'm good. finally, a smile."
15111,Susan,why not?you said he was nice.
13464,Susan,"oh, sorry. was that petulant too?"
17223,Susan,"well, you can tell me anything. that's what we talked about in all those sessions with the doctor."
14780,Susan,"julie, i did something bad. something really, really bad. aren't you gonna ask me what it was?"
16262,Susan,"oh, dear god."
15369,Susan,i take it you met mike.
16642,Susan,"and she kept saying, please, let me make it up to you!"
13448,Susan,yeah.
14786,Susan,"well, how can i not? i feel so guilty, i can barely look him in the eye when he talks about zach."
15469,Susan,"no,don't bother,'cause i'm going."
16712,Susan,yes.yesterday.susan mayer.your new neighbor.
16722,Susan,"okay,before we go any further,can i check those diplomas?'cause i would just like to make sure that they're not from some med school in the philippines."
13563,Susan,"alright, back up a little more. there you go. wooo! alright, here we go."
13466,Susan,uh-
17679,Susan,how close are you? 'cause i can wait.
17912,Susan,i thought that was clear.
14488,Susan,"when i was packing up your stuff in your bedroom, i found a box of bullets."
14831,Susan,"oh, i think i do. you're a cold-blooded murderer."
14308,Susan,what?
13935,Susan,what do you mean?
17768,Susan,"well, she didn't."
18005,Susan,"well, i don't need you to do me any favors. what i need is for everyone to just stick the plan. monday, wednesday, friday--mike watches his son. he doesn't pawn him off on his girlfriend."
18032,Susan,"anyway, um, can't wait for the party. it's gonna be fun."
17104,Susan,what do you suggest we do?
16388,Susan,don't worry. happens to everybody. maybe it would help to talk about it.
15997,Susan,"before we begin, would either of you like some cookies, milk, lemonade, perhaps?"
14354,Susan,i've been plenty supportive.
16668,Susan,"well, the doves are not going to release themselves."
18131,Susan,"don't worry, edie. you're gonna get through this. you're gonna be just fine."
15716,Susan,"sorry.ah, well, that sounds, ah, just, ah, that sounds great."
14903,Susan,"oh, that's just you rebounding from edie."
13658,Susan,what's your favourite food?
16638,Susan,"oh. oh! oh, i would love that!"
18070,Susan,"getting to know each other better. oh, napkins."
17026,Susan,can we talk? this will just take a second. did you kiss that boy?
14525,Susan,really?
13664,Susan,hi.
13892,Susan,"oh no, i'm sure she's fine. we're talking about mrs. huber. she's like a roach!"
16377,Susan,"oh, my god. mike, you saved our lives."
18396,Susan,what are you gonna do to us? why did you bring us here?
14729,Susan,"well, thanks for your discretion."
15627,Susan,"oh, help!can anybody hear me? julie?i, i need you to try to unlock the door. oh, what am i saying?okay , i need you to unbuckle yourself and try to find a neighbor."
17260,Susan,and karl made his happy monkey face. did you notice that?
13839,Susan,"well, yes, they were writing to each other."
14057,Susan,"no, i, i just, i think that you should slow things down. i, i, i want you to not see her for awhile."
13533,Susan,what?! i am not desperate.
17193,Susan,"i know when i'm dreaming, and this really happened. why else would i be sponging butt prints off my stool?"
17051,Susan,"thank you. hey, you know, would you like me to pack some up for you guys to take?"
14930,Susan,you'd be an amazing mother.
15057,Susan,"right, interesting."
13729,Susan,"mike! what a small, small world."
16495,Susan,"say, ""i'm a rude, arrogant bastard who needs to treat women with courtesy and respect!"""
17164,Susan,"yeah, you're going to college soon, and i want him to tell you about the dangers of drugs. scare her straight, mike."
14785,Susan,"well, i can't do that. you heard what he said about his wiring. i betrayed him. he'll never forgive me."
14435,Susan,us too. the house will seem just empty without you
15158,Susan,oh. so why are we dating?
14141,Susan,the stomach.
17887,Susan,you know-- maybe i do feel incomplete without a man. but i-- wouldn't trade places with you for anything. you wanna know why?
16834,Susan,"yeah, i don't know. it's getting a little weird. you know, adam is my neighbor."
17473,Susan,"could you please take care of this guy? he's my friend, too."
16609,Susan,you stole my florist?
17862,Susan,edie? edie! do you not hear me?
13673,Susan,mrs. greenberg. do you remember those two eggs i let you borrow last christmas?
14265,Susan,that's not true!
17163,Susan,"i know, but this visit was really more for julie."
17267,Susan,thank you. which cousin?
18103,Susan,karl. what are you doing here?
15461,Susan,"oh,my god!oh,thank you so much."
13606,Susan,yeah.sort of.
17552,Susan,what are you doing? we talked about this. you're supposed to be new at it.
13951,Susan,what are you saying?
13442,Susan,i keep hoping he'll ask me out.
17134,Susan,you can stay as long as you want.
16024,Susan,"oh, no, i'm your boss' girlfriend. surely he mentioned me."
18242,Susan,what was that about?
18375,Susan,"well, i hope you get there soon."
16864,Susan,"bree? can we call a truce, please? so you know i'm not bluffing, um, i brought cake."
13943,Susan,"karl, don't you turn away from me. look at me! you know, what else were you doing during our marriage? how many other women were you sticking it to? as god as my witness, it will snow on the hills of hell, before i ever feel sorry for you again!"
18009,Susan,"absolutely not. in this house, we do not eat pretentious cheeses. we eat honest american peanut butter. now watch your movie, and i'll be back in a minute."
17011,Susan,oh!
14870,Susan,"no, i came between the man and his son. there's a huge betrayal. i, i can't even blame him for hating me."
15724,Susan,i love you.it is really just dinner.
13848,Susan,no.
18166,Susan,"three weeks later, i found brandi's bra in karl's glove compartment, and, well, you know the rest."
16788,Susan,"so it's not my imagination. they're bigger, right?"
13945,Susan,"oh, well, in that case, come on in. i'm not doing anything."
13907,Susan,"oh, well--"" ""i am the best, aren't i."
14324,Susan,"that's okay, that's okay."
13787,Susan,"hold on a minute, now. i started snooping around because i found all that money by accident. and, and then, i found a gun. are you a drug dealer or something?"
15932,Susan,"oh, i didn't say that."
17329,Susan,"oh, right. maynard. oh, that's awful--that he died."
15842,Susan,what?
13905,Susan,"uh, try ripping up old photos. it helps."
13581,Susan,"again, i don't know what you're talking about. but- yeah, i did."
16910,Susan,"nothing, huh?"
17459,Susan,"yeah, you'll drop by later--with potato skins on your breath, you miserable two-timer!"
16624,Susan,"no, i guess not."
13737,Susan,"oh, yeah, i'm here to ride the bull. check it out! okay! yeah! woo! baby! woo!"
15427,Susan,what's this?
14139,Susan,"well, i wouldn't know about that."
13854,Susan,"oh, no good. my publisher's got me under the gun for something. what about friday?"
14990,Susan,"oh, okay."
16224,Susan,"oh, 'cause he's a great kid, and he's gonna want to help mike--and you're not gonna be wearing a bra when you ask him out."
17929,Susan,"oh, yeah. he's a great guy. i just, uh, want to be alone right now."
18313,Susan,after the crash--
15072,Susan,"well,what do you think?"
15496,Susan,what's going on?
14200,Susan,what was that?
14963,Susan,i can't believe this!
17812,Susan,because we have never said it.
13902,Susan,you're not? what happened?
17980,Susan,congratulations on getting me out of your office.
16106,Susan,"well, i am certainly not playing with a woman that is willing to let mike take the fall for her psycho husband."
15227,Susan,"oh, oh! no, no,stop right there.okay, i would love to see you two crazy kids get hitched in holland more than anyone,with the tulips and the clogs,in front of a windmill,the whole shebang.but unless i get this surgery,my spleen is going to slam straight into my heart and explode.so, you know, seeing as i am just a nice person and i always support gay rights,let's just do this.and then i'll have a husband and insurance.nobody gets hurt."
15301,Susan,as opposed to the 12 i wasted on you?why are we talking about this?i don't recall asking you your opinion.
16342,Susan,i should go 'cause ian's parents are here.
14045,Susan,everything.
17742,Susan,why not?
14736,Susan,oh. zach. zach!
15394,Susan,it was hysterical.i thought the whole wedding day was ruined.
18124,Susan,"yeah, ""aw, hell."" you got a problem here, karl. your son's got some serious anger issues, and you need to figure out what's going on."
13417,Susan,"that's a good idea. edie will get there at 5:45, which means her breasts will arrive at 5:30, so i should shoot for 5."
17523,Susan,"well, i sort of started seeing someone."
17612,Susan,poor karen. i hope she's okay.
15295,Susan,what are you doing here?
13560,Susan,wear these. i don't want you to leave any fingerprints.
17381,Susan,really?
14925,Susan,you won?
14605,Susan,"zach is your son,isn't he?"
14674,Susan,"well, see? there you go."
13928,Susan,"of all people, you picked that tired piece of - edie!"
16851,Susan,i pick lynette. where's lynette?
13863,Susan,"i'm so sorry, i thought there was someone in the house."
18338,Susan,i don't know. jealousy? jackson thinks mike is still hung up on me.
17099,Susan,"uh, she went to the hospital with carlos. he was pretty banged up, but they say he's gonna be okay."
17824,Susan,"this is so fun! i haven't been out in ages. tonight, i am gonna--boogie-oogie-oogie--"
15038,Susan,"carol, if you would just stop throwing things at me, i'll explain!"
18133,Susan,"i don't know, but she is the reason we're on this trip. uh, maybe we could share memories or tell stories."
16953,Susan,"okay, if anybody needs me, i'll be at the hardware store buying chains."
18381,Susan,"um, can't we find a gas station or maybe a diner?"
15435,Susan,whoa!
15581,Susan,bree-- are you okay?
16656,Susan,"see ya. oh, by the way--you know that one percent sliver of a doubt thing i told you about? totally gone. any question i had about mike's been answered."
17328,Susan,"i think it's a beautiful way to honor your grandfather. i mean, ""james"" wouldn't be my first choice, but it's a good, solid name."
18270,Susan,"you want people to think this is a real marriage, don't you?"
13883,Susan,"and i still kinda do it. i just want somebody to talk to about all my adult stuff, and she's right there, and she just acts so mature, i forget she's thirteen."
16689,Susan,"well, i don't know if you've noticed, but my idea of the perfect wedding keeps changing. one day, i want white roses, and then i want lilies, and first, i want a harpist, and then a string quartet. only one thing stays constant--and i'm looking at him. why would i need anything else to make my wedding perfect?"
18320,Susan,i'm sorry. we'll go fishing another time.
17553,Susan,"oh! of what? you're 3 inches off the ground. you're completely padded. so just do what i say--wobble, wobble. ""daddy, look at me!"" crash."
16447,Susan,but he was cleared. all charges dropped. here. eat this.
17128,Susan,"oh, no, don't get me wrong. i mean, i think it's great. you should grab love wherever you can find it. who cares if your friends think that you're paying for it?"
15021,Susan,solicitation? you were arrested for solicitation?
17971,Susan,"okay, okay. point made. move along."
14668,Susan,are you in love with her?
15294,Susan,oh. um--okay.there's more on the back.
13783,Susan,"what? oh, i can explain."
16513,Susan,what? i thought you said she was with victor.
15074,Susan,"i think he should spend some time with decent role model,don't you?"
17594,Susan,uh-- it--it looks good.
14696,Susan,that is so not true!
14585,Susan,i didn't think you did. now tell me why zach does.
14591,Susan,"zach is your son, isn't he?"
14173,Susan,why would i go anywhere with you?
17330,Susan,"oh, and rare, really rare."
16233,Susan,"i'm just stunned. so i guess they worked it out, right?"
16934,Susan,like what?
15649,Susan,"they're just ants, and they're tiny.of course, they do outnumber me."
13400,Susan,"oh, it's sort of a new tradition."
16014,Susan,relationships have nothing to do with good judgment. it doesn't matter how smart you are. you can still get hurt. you do your homework. i'm gonna finish the laundry. okay.
18042,Susan,"uh, nothing."
14044,Susan,yes.
14638,Susan,"mmm, brunch. brunch would be nice."
15885,Susan,"okay,i know it's hard, but you gotta make an effort,and, you know, if your head is a little foggy, then don't look there. look in your heart, because i'm in there, just like you're inside mine. okay, um, this is mary alice's house, and this is where we first met. i was setting out my macaroni and cheese, and you were invited--oh! ow!"
14062,Susan,i wish i could. i still feel like something's not right.
18171,Susan,"bree, how did you know where she lived?"
13347,Susan,and you're a plumber. right?
14410,Susan,"although if you wouldn't mind, i'm really like to see that video tape i found, the one marked ""angela"". it'd be nice to see mary alice when she was young."
16381,Susan,i don't think you can really thank somebody too many times for saving your life.
16216,Susan,zach young? our zach young? how does he afford diamonds?
15258,Susan,"thanks,hon.that really helps.okay,now i want you to go over and slip this ring to your father.and just so you know,if edie catches you,i'm expecting you to swallow it."
13914,Susan,good.
14206,Susan,you lied to me.
17067,Susan,"i'm sorry, so--orson already knows about mike?"
15053,Susan,that was a good one.
17787,Susan,"no, i'm talking about that line you fed her. ""sports illustrated""? what's the issue about, the senior olympics?"
13312,Susan,"well, sometimes people are so unhappy they think it's the only way they can solve their problems."
18264,Susan,what do you want?
14232,Susan,sorry.
15413,Susan,"wait until i leave to tell her,'cause she's gonna kill me."
15749,Susan,oh please.
18376,Susan,"gosh, it feels like we've been driving forever. maybe we should stretch our legs."
14014,Susan,what is going on here? were you just kissing my daughter?
16761,Susan,"katherine, hi. oh, uh, i brought you that salad bowl."
14688,Susan,thank you so much for changing your mind about helping me. i really appreciate it.
14676,Susan,"oh, i'm being nice. i could have him arrested. i mean, don't get me wrong. i am all for julie spending time with karl. he is still her dad, and she loves him."
15722,Susan,"hi.um.so i need to ask you something. ian, you know, from across the hall.you met him.anyway, he sort of asked me out on a date.i know you're thrown, i was thrown too.but he's really nice and i could sort of use someone to talk to, who also talks back.the thing is i'm sort of lonely.the past six months have been really hard on me.so what i need is, i need to know if it okay with you if i go out with him.because if it's not, i won't.in fact i'd like nothing better than for you to just wake up right now and tell me not to go out with him.just wake up and tell me!wake up! please!"
17903,Susan,"uh, no, nothing's wrong. just--we need to talk about this move."
18234,Susan,mike and i got in a car accident.
16298,Susan,are you sure? 'cause you seem a little anxious.
16414,Susan,"hi. ian, about what i said--"
14947,Susan,"mom, i need answers."
16029,Susan,how long has rupert worked for you?
16271,Susan,yes. i accept your proposal to propose.
17204,Susan,"okay, but in the meantime, um, i do have a teenage daughter, so if you could--"
13874,Susan,what is that supposed to mean?
16743,Susan,really? that's fantastic!
14816,Susan,"mom, why don't you just go see a dressmaker?"
15946,Susan,"it's my first time in paris. i want it to be magical, and that means accessories, so back off."
16217,Susan,"yeah, i thought it was in a trust, and he couldn't touch it."
18343,Susan,"okay, katherine, that is--it's totally unfair to mike. i mean, he needs to know the truth."
15789,Susan,"wow, my heart is pounding."
16645,Susan,"i mean, what could i say?"
13964,Susan,"hello, anybody home?"
17833,Susan,what does that mean?
17395,Susan,really? whose?
15914,Susan,"oh, i just thought of something. i'm never gonna celebrate a fifty-third wedding anniversary. i'd have to live into my nineties. oh, my god. i'm gonna die."
15644,Susan,oh.
15836,Susan,"ian, can you please hurry?"
14566,Susan,"we're not. it's a deterrent in case zach comes back. i told mike i didn't sleep last night, so he got me this sign. that guy is so supportive. you know he's out right now in a ride-along with the police searching for zach?"
17550,Susan,yeah. i think it's just beginner's luck. uh-huh.
17000,Susan,"gee, i don't think i've ever heard such strong opinions on the subject. i mean, not that it's something i talk about a lot--or ever."
15765,Susan,"bree, we are just doing this because we love you. but, if you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt--"
15346,Susan,sure.
17661,Susan,"and so there i was in ninth grade, and my boobs had not made an appearance. i was desperate."
14733,Susan,"have you seen this boy? hey, missing kid. anyone? going once, going twice--"
15289,Susan,"what ""little thing""?"
14234,Susan,"oh, edie. wait up, i, i want to ask you something."
14117,Susan,is the seventh important?
17321,Susan,like the deodorant?
15477,Susan,no?
18138,Susan,"uh, you think i'm homeless. oh, no, no, no. no, i live here. i-i can prove it. i know exactly what's in this garbage bag. um, empty carton of eggs, coffee grinds, shampoo bottle--"
17397,Susan,you know--this is why it's taking four months to get my house painted.
16996,Susan,"no, they just had a baby. we're gonna ""ooh,"" we're gonna ""ahh,"" and then we're gonna eat."
14009,Susan,"well, we meet on tuesdays, and it's potluck lunch. everybody has to bring something."
13998,Susan,"well, edie, you're not that bad, and, and, and believe me, i'm, i'm not that good."
18337,Susan,did mike turn jackson in to immigration?
17621,Susan,how much am i paying you?
15456,Susan,"good.oh!god,i--i'm being so rude.um,mike,i-i want you to meet--"
15846,Susan,thank you.
15152,Susan,yeah.sometimes it actually makes me a little nervous.
13685,Susan,i checked upon this silvercrest place. it's a treatment center for troubled kids. who's gonna notice one more? i create the distraction. you blend in and find zach.
14507,Susan,"okay, next time i won't bring my daughter to stalk my boyfriend. it was a slight error in judgment. honey, please don't give me the silent treatment."
15235,Susan,what the hell?
13576,Susan,edie wait! um-mike and i were gonna go see the movies on wednesday-and i just thought it would be fun if you joined us.
18109,Susan,"karl, i'm serious. don't mess with me. i have a yardstick, and i'm not afraid to use it."
16644,Susan,"she's so excited, so needy."
15675,Susan,can you sit up?
17750,Susan,edie!
17431,Susan,oh. thanks. so i guess you met jackson.
16476,Susan,"hell, there's some things we don't need to know about."
17667,Susan,thank you--for a wonderful third date. and i'm glad that you're back on board with our plan.
13500,Susan,just a sec.
17437,Susan,i'll explain over breakfast. did you get the paper?
18196,Susan,that's weird.
17582,Susan,get out.
18036,Susan,what? where the hell is it?
15872,Susan,me? but why doesn't she leave? i-i'm the one who's been here every day for the last six months.
15424,Susan,where'd you find that?
17236,Susan,"no, i'm not finished with it. it's a lamaze class. i guarantee you i will not be the only woman in there holding a chimichanga. wow, it's all couples. i wish mike didn't have that rehab thing tonight."
16097,Susan,"you are the only one allowed to ravish me these days, so stop worrying."
16939,Susan,"this is awkward. uh, i told katherine i'd vote for her."
15593,Susan,"you know, it's late.why don't you, uh,go to bed and, you know,let julie and i help you with that in the morning?"
17289,Susan,what are you gonna do?
14976,Susan,"i know. but i gotta find out if there's something there. i've always wanted a dad. i mean, i know not having one affected me."
14154,Susan,oh.
13372,Susan,"oh mary alice, what did you do?"
17720,Susan,"hey, i believe in marriage."
13963,Susan,i absolutely did not do that thing you accused me of.
16025,Susan,loving that idea.
13722,Susan,so friends can do that.
17607,Susan,where's karen?
18178,Susan,we thought you might wanna scatter them somewhere.
13510,Susan,"oh, maybe until noon. then i'm going to have to run over there and beg him to love me ."
13858,Susan,come over and help my find my pilot light.
17314,Susan,"no, no, no, i love where this is going."
18068,Susan,"oh, please. i didn't even get a chance to change. my ex was late picking up m.j., which is insane, 'cause he lives right across the street."
15933,Susan,"a little of both, so, boozan."
14597,Susan,"obviously, um, it was quite a shock, but it's good news any way you slice it."
18105,Susan,i am an art teacher.
14320,Susan,for shoving her.
15208,Susan,why would you need a fake bride?
13757,Susan,"of course, of course, yes. so, maybe we should make reservations, you know, just in case."
16280,Susan,of course. i should let you rest.
17740,Susan,when i'm done. don't change the subject. are you seeing someone?
13380,Susan,i keep hoping he'll ask me out.
13605,Susan,"oh!uh, you seem like a really sweet guy, in an interesting line of work. but i um i'm not really available."
15731,Susan,here's a job. how about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist?
13851,Susan,"perfumes and oils. and i want to pick out the outfit that you are going to tear off me. and plus, i need to be in complete control of the lighting."
13577,Susan,"yeah. yeah, that's okay ,isn't it, mike?"
17931,Susan,what?
13796,Susan,"i don't know, but i'm scared. something's very, very wrong."
16284,Susan,here. i'm gonna go get bree some flowers. i'll be right back.
17840,Susan,my mechanic? are you crazy?
18260,Susan,get out or i will kick your ass back to the canadian border!
16537,Susan,moved? what do you mean?
15056,Susan,"i like 'em, very nice."
13990,Susan,"you know, for what it's worth, i would have talked to you in high school."
14887,Susan,"karl, did you cheat again?"
17219,Susan,i understand.
14260,Susan,"no, we didn't. you know i just said what you wanted to hear because you guilted me into it."
16735,Susan,"oh,my gosh. she's out of the clinic."
15464,Susan,"now i'm absolutely horrified that i'm about to say what i'm about to say,but there's nobody else i can talk to who won't judge me.and since you're a complete stranger, i'll probably never see you again unless i randomly run into you on the street,in which case,you'll ignore me'cause you know how crazy i am."
18232,Susan,"karl, what are you doing here?"
14740,Susan,but then i got hungry.
15384,Susan,"i said something to dr. ron before the operation,and it just--devastated him."
17352,Susan,is that what it said?
14018,Susan,what is he talking about? what's happening on friday?
13463,Susan,"honey, stay out of this."
14243,Susan,edie.
17012,Susan,"and he needed something for the pain, so he happened to find the last two pills in the medicine cabinet, and he took 'em. it's no big deal."
14965,Susan,apparently he owns the place.
14896,Susan,"you're, like, the first fourteen chapters."
15176,Susan,what? you want me to put my life on the line to service your ego?
16897,Susan,do you like wine?
16930,Susan,"oh, my god. wow! it's a fountain, too."
17205,Susan,yes. thanks.
15928,Susan,bless you. mmm. so what else happened?
17663,Susan,the sex music. turn it off.
13478,Susan,while you were married to someone else!
14825,Susan,mom.
17992,Susan,"we already thanked her, buddy. let's not make her uncomfortable."
14510,Susan,"oh, mary alice, what did you do?"
16765,Susan,"okay, when i'm in labor and i am pushing and screaming to bring your child into the world, do you really want me to remember that you denied me syrup?"
17946,Susan,fantastic!
13325,Susan,"i made it, trust me. hey, hey, do you have a death wish?"
16032,Susan,"oh, no, don't do that. that'll just make it worse. i get it. he loved jane. he doesn't know me. you know, i'll just have to charm him, warm him up a little."
15812,Susan,i have never had meaningless sex.
15242,Susan,"so we shouldn't expect a wedding gift,huh?"
13808,Susan,"julie, what's going on?"
16573,Susan,"okay, north. i need north. moss grows on the north side of trees."
16854,Susan,"no, no! wait, wait, wait. gaby, you know how it works. okay, first, i have to go over all the signals. okay, so, um, this is movie, um, tv--"
16045,Susan,why do you have to be this way?
15803,Susan,"because it was really eleven, and i knocked off two, and you're still judging me."
15330,Susan,super-duper.how you feeling?
14610,Susan,"did you spend the night with edie? oh, my god!"
14553,Susan,"yeah, he's crazy!"
15094,Susan,are you jim?i'm susan mayer.
16314,Susan,anyone hungry?
14144,Susan,"oh, god, you scared me."
15237,Susan,she'd kill us both.
15145,Susan,oh.maybe we could go out sometime?
13424,Susan,"mm, that's mr. mullin. and just so you know, if he invites you in, you have to meet all of his pets."
15163,Susan,you?
16623,Susan,she said that i would make mike wish he was back in a coma.
15637,Susan,ohh! that's my girl!
16054,Susan,i get it. as much as i have tried to pretend that it's just you and me. there's three of us in this relationship.
15699,Susan,"oh.well, how long until you can do another one?"
17470,Susan,i'm just not comfortable with you and jackson getting that close.
16867,Susan,"oh, no. is everything okay?"
15534,Susan,"$2,000?jeez! i gotta get into real estate.okay,i don't have that kind of cash."
15430,Susan,why are you hanging on to that?
15923,Susan,"but first, i think i should use the powder room."
15439,Susan,"oh,no!you don't mean that."
15572,Susan,what?
17399,Susan,"mm. uh, lynette, it's not really a good time."
17960,Susan,"exactly. and so even though i was already halfway to the airport, i turned around and i came home, and, yep, i had left the garbage disposal on. so ever since then, i always check."
14684,Susan,hmm.
17911,Susan,"you know, if we're gonna have a get-together after the funeral, we should start thinking about food."
16708,Susan,"oh,my god.this is not little dylan.i'm susan,julie's mom.she is gonna be so excited to see you."
16887,Susan,"well, yeah. i don't bake. catch up."
14456,Susan,what?
15097,Susan,oh! oww! oh!
15272,Susan,"oh,yes.you know,this whole fake marriage thing was okay when nobody was getting hurt.what are we doing? it's a lie!i lost mike over a lie,and now i'm doing the same thing to dr. ron,and--and look at edie.she was devastated.i don't think i can go through with this."
14564,Susan,why?
17117,Susan,i hope you don't mind that i'm going to kiss you.
18243,Susan,is it working?
17886,Susan,that is not much of a distinction.
14072,Susan,"he wants to have kids, and he had that look that men get that says 'i'm ready to procreate, point me to the nearest cervix'."
17070,Susan,"yeah, i can see that. hi. i'm his neighbor. cute shoes. why the hell would you give mike drugs?"
16103,Susan,mike is innocent. i know that in my heart.
13934,Susan,"new york, new york."
18233,Susan,wow.
17810,Susan,"it was--i don't know, uh, about a month after you moved out. it was bedtime. i was trying to read to him, but he only wanted you. and he was crying so hard, and he kept asking me if you were ever coming back, and so i finally--said maybe you would. i just didn't want him to be so sad."
17869,Susan,"please, help! please! i'm getting a really unpleasant picture of what you're like in the ol' sackarooni."
14080,Susan,thank you.
15738,Susan,oh my god!
18407,Susan,mike. mike!
18431,Susan,"karl,just stop."
13327,Susan,"susan mayer, i live across the street."
17031,Susan,"oh, fine. break my heart."
17864,Susan,what is wrong with you?
17421,Susan,"they were a mother and a child. she was a mother, just like me--with a child just like ours. and if it weren't for us, they would still be alive."
13519,Susan,i hope it's not important.
14958,Susan,"of course i am. i'm not gonna pretend like i'm not still a little freaked out. i am. but i did a lot of thinking about it this morning, and i, i think i understand. you wanted to protect me, and you thought i needed a hero. i had one. you."
17150,Susan,"oh, please. after what you've been through, no one is judging. come on in. i'll put on some coffee. oh, um, this is my cousin tim. tim, this is the neighbors."
13938,Susan,"thanks for your concern, karl, i'm fine."
14705,Susan,"it was not murder, it was manslaughter, and that's totally different. mike and i aren't even living together, and he cares about julie."
15585,Susan,"um-- no, that's okay.they're fine."
15030,Susan,"oh, hi, alberta. how are you? were you the one that sent out those neighborhood watch pamphlets? i was wondering if maybe you had any extra copies. or i'll just borrow one from somebody else. thanks."
16059,Susan,"no, not just yet."
17060,Susan,i got you the fondue set.
17978,Susan,i'll take it.
15638,Susan,"no! no. it's all good. oh! but you should know that your bed doubles as the dining table, and the toilet's in the shower."
16427,Susan,"yeah. yeah, why not? sure. you know what? do you wanna run this ice cream side before it melts?"
14409,Susan,"no. i'm good, thanks."
14012,Susan,on my front lawn?
13705,Susan,"okay, you can leave now."
16263,Susan,hey.
15032,Susan,"well, now you're gonna have to tell her the truth."
18020,Susan,"hey, guys. what are we talking about?"
18357,Susan,really.
15798,Susan,ian.
14753,Susan,"well, i can't tell you. you know, you messed up a lot of people's lives. you can't run away from that."
15146,Susan,i love sushi.i'm available tomorrow night.
14868,Susan,thanks.
14828,Susan,"no, don't come near me."
17925,Susan,"change the locks, don't talk to me, then leave."
13697,Susan,i saw the movie. it was really good.
15457,Susan,thank you so much for helping me out.
18420,Susan,what are you smiling about?
13486,Susan,thanks for helping me break in. do you think it's gonna be hard to replace that screen?
14246,Susan,"so what then? if you can't have him, nobody can?"
13725,Susan,i'm going to the bathroom and i'm going home. i don't want mike to catch me here.
17916,Susan,"great. yeah, i haven't worn these jeans in a while, and i found 20 bucks in the pocket. don't you just love when that happens? also, karl left me for his secretary, so i need you to change these locks."
15271,Susan,she found the ring and the prenup in your briefcase.she thought you were gonna pop the question tonight.
13967,Susan,you did? what'd you talk about?
14860,Susan,"mike, stop."
13494,Susan,i was thinking we left too late.
14541,Susan,"can i at least get you something to eat, zach?"
14311,Susan,"no, no it's just banged a little."
15655,Susan,mmmm.
14237,Susan,"well, see that's the thing, he doesn't think of himself as ""your bill"" cause he said that date was just a one time thing. which i know because when he asked me out, i told him i thought you guys were involved."
17868,Susan,no. help! get me out of here!
15011,Susan,so are you coming in?
17827,Susan,"hey, jackson. what? really?"
18003,Susan,but we can make brownies at home.
13554,Susan,obviously i can't let her get away with this. the only thing to do is to go to the police and tell them everything that happened.
16437,Susan,"oh, no, no, no. no, i'm not pregnant. no, i just know know what i want, which is ian. so i'm just eager to you know, no- not get it over with, per se, but just to get to the good part, which is the marriage to ian."
14272,Susan,"mom, mike and i aren't together anymore."
16338,Susan,yeah. that was the first night that we spent together. i wanted to surprise you.
16626,Susan,i don't. i was just on my way to apologize to you.
15557,Susan,"you're always worried about julie and me,and you beat up my new boyfriend.and now you're protecting me from edie.do you know what all that means?"
17176,Susan,so you didn't go back?
14516,Susan,"mike, hi, sweetie. i hope the job's going well. um, so i hope you're not mad, but i found mrs. huber's journal in your truck, and, well, i couldn't exactly not read it, so i did, and, um, i know all about the blackmail, so call me. we'll talk. love you. bye."
16489,Susan,"excuse me! uh, hey! excuse me. that's my space!"
17701,Susan,"why? oh, my god."
17615,Susan,can't we just keep going the way we are?
14718,Susan,"yeah, but that doesn't mean we have to act like brother and sister. i mean, you bought me ribs. i have gratitude to express."
16417,Susan,ow! damn! thumbtack!
17841,Susan,"bob! um--uh, what are you doing here?"
16529,Susan,to england? what's wrong?
17027,Susan,"oh, well, you're gonna thank me. do you know that he has his tongue pierced?"
17454,Susan,so you just happened to stumble across my secret turn-on the same night that you and mike became b.f.f.s?
17047,Susan,"yeah, he said that you owed him money for some--plumbing job that he helped you on."
17203,Susan,"well, if you insist--"
13551,Susan,"julie? julie ,honey, wake up. we need to talk.."
14973,Susan,"well, actually, there's a 'help wanted' sign in the window so i was thinking about getting a job there. and, you know, he would get to know me and i'm sure he would like me and i would like him, and then one day he would say, 'you're like the daughter i never had' and i'd say, 'well, actually, now that you've mentioned it.'"
15743,Susan,"well, yes, and how nice that would have been, huh? um, but, no, no, i'm a brain specialist."
17658,Susan,wow. so now you're painting--my bathroom?
15950,Susan,you told me you weren't even friends with him. now you're shoplifting together?
14519,Susan,"i am so sorry for that last phone call. um, let's just say it was the worry talking. i just really need to talk to you, and-"
17049,Susan,my matchmaking skills. julie and barrett are really hitting it off.
16330,Susan,just take the robe off. and whatever you have on underneath--consider that yours.
18002,Susan,"no, thank you. let's go."
13558,Susan,"hey, that's right."
17619,Susan,"it's susan. and he was the first one to say he didn't want to get serious, which is why i was happy. we were just having fun."
13795,Susan,i hope the kids aren't too much for danielle to handle.
17974,Susan,"no. but i read in your brochure that faculty members get a 50% discount, so for your art department, how would you like to hire an award-winning children's book illustrator who is great with kids and has a face you can't say no to?"
17531,Susan,wow! isn't it fantastic?
17434,Susan,"oh, well, first off, um, m.j. was at a sleep over last night. and, in fact, jackson and he haven't even met, so, uh, there's really no need for you to be hanging--or checking."
17908,Susan,do what?
16670,Susan,"you would think that, but no. come on. this is something that we have both looked forward to for so long. don't you want it to be perfect?"
16771,Susan,"i'm sorry, honey. you wanted a decision. this is my decision."
17157,Susan,"well, it doesn't have to be toilets. i mean, it could be sinks, bathtubs."
13518,Susan,"we, uh, got this by mistake."
18367,Susan,"oh, my god. i--i-i had no idea. i'm so sorry."
14695,Susan,"yeah, well, we've all seen your talent, which is a nice way of telling you why don't you put some curtains on your bedroom window?"
16305,Susan,it's perfect.
16564,Susan,"well, clearly, you were not paying attention, because i did go back to mike the second he woke up, and he'd totally forgotten me!"
13359,Susan,"i can't believe it. this can't be happening. mike can't like edie better than me, he just can't!"
17713,Susan,right! right. you mind easing away so i can dance with my daughter?
16507,Susan,"it's devastating! if i go with mike, ian's heart will be broken, and ian does not deserve that. but how can i reject mike after all he's been through?"
16932,Susan,"i was just wondering, um, do you think you could move it to your backyard?"
15076,Susan,"oh, sorry!are you okay?"
17014,Susan,he said there were no more pills. i was looking him in the eye.
16750,Susan,"oh, my god. katherine."
14620,Susan,what? how could you not tell me that? we share everything. that's what we're known for. that's our thing.
13634,Susan,i've got one. kelly holstatter. in eighth grade she used to spit in my gym shoes.
14281,Susan,i know.
15973,Susan,the last thing i said to her was that she disappointed me.
17401,Susan,"oh, you poor thing! you need a hug."
15226,Susan,"oh, no,it's a serious illness.see, it just sounds silly 'cause of the word ""spleen."""
13756,Susan,oh? like a hotel room?
15005,Susan,"bree, i'm so sorry."
15006,Susan,"i know this sounds awful, but i'm kind of glad the guy's dead."
15908,Susan,"believe me, i would love to, but, um, i gotta, i gotta get dinner started for julie."
14048,Susan,"paul, i am so sorry."
13956,Susan,"and, there's nothing there."
17293,Susan,"well, that's gonna change real soon."
16535,Susan,"oh, poor mr. henley. he does seem to be getting worse. thanks for stopping by."
16983,Susan,"you killed a crooked cop who was coming after you. that's self-defense, and even so, you regret it, right?"
14087,Susan,what?
14102,Susan,get out.
18084,Susan,"i thought it was gonna rain. okay, um--i'm not gay."
14328,Susan,"yeah, i sympathise, i really do. but you have to take her back."
15319,Susan,i think i have to break up with dr. ron.
16266,Susan,"yes, i did. it's just--"
15332,Susan,mike is love. mmm.
14897,Susan,i'm gonna be honest.
15329,Susan,okay.bye.
15325,Susan,that's not helpful.
15584,Susan,"oh, okay."
18411,Susan,issues? what kind of issues do you think i have?
14643,Susan,"there! there, that was it. did you hear it?"
15726,Susan,he sort of asked me out.
16637,Susan,"you and me? oh! well, i-i'm beyond flattered. i-i find you to be an incredibly attractive woman. i just--"
14340,Susan,what are you doing?!
17602,Susan,"uh, yeah. you want to move in."
13624,Susan,"honey, i batted everything that wasn't nailed down. i'm telling you, nothing."
13831,Susan,what?
14744,Susan,but-
17382,Susan,thanks. now i want you to have that phone on you at all times--because i'm still not sure how to work the dishwasher.
14878,Susan,that's okay. people make-
16795,Susan,we need whipped cream.
13629,Susan,that's what happened with carl. i only dated him a couple of months. i filled in the blanks; i married him. it was a disaster!
16995,Susan,"mike, how long are you gonna be? we've gotta get this food over to bree's before it gets cold."
15898,Susan,how do you sleep at night?
14556,Susan,"oh, god! oh, there's blood."
13346,Susan,uh-- i have a clog.
18142,Susan,how about coffee? i just put on a pot.
13358,Susan,he's spending the night?
16465,Susan,and if he won?
17362,Susan,"oh, my god. oh, my god! i'm so proud of you! okay, i am going to need a bumper sticker right away so i can start annoying all the other parents!"
17032,Susan,trust me. your finger is not where he'd put it.
14405,Susan,"paul, hi."
15249,Susan,"karl,you are so not allowed to get angry.i mean,i might've been the one to throw away the wedding ring,but you threw away the whole marriage.there was plenty of bad behavior that went on back then,so just get off your high horse.we're on the same page now,so we should just focus on that."
14957,Susan,are you saying that i'm the result of my mother having a one-night stand?
18018,Susan,what?
18363,Susan,"okay. bye, mike. have a nice wedding."
18360,Susan,"hey, dave. glad i caught you. is your friend's boat still available this weekend?"
17834,Susan,"lee, that is not what i'm doing. is jackson perfect? no. but i don't think there is such a thing, and i have a history of sabotaging relationships. no, i'm doing this. i'm moving."
14385,Susan,ow ow.
18401,Susan,"oh, my god."
16446,Susan,he was totally innocent.
14685,Susan,"oh, my daughter is singing a song at church and i want to accompany her on the piano and i haven't played in years. oh, you were just so amazing at rex's funeral the other day, i was wondering--"
15312,Susan,"nurse hisel,i can explain."
18423,Susan,"for god's sake, tim, she's ticklish! how many times do you have to be told?"
16651,Susan,how are you doing?
17083,Susan,"uh, no."
18008,Susan,"no, we do not have any provolone."
17097,Susan,"no. there's no tomorrow. it's now. you will quit this now. you will go to rehab, or so help me, i will leave you. i will take this baby, and i will leave you."
16565,Susan,bug.
16204,Susan,"honey, i was over at edie's today and i walked in the door and--"
18052,Susan,mayfair. stay out of this. this is between me and my ex. got it?
16904,Susan,"i'm not, i'm not. now get some mud. i wanna dirty him up so he looks like he's been through hell. okay, in you go."
14440,Susan,i don't suppose she told you he was a drug dealer?
17913,Susan,all right.
16320,Susan,"no, karl's alive and kicking, sadly."
16612,Susan,"in this town in wedding season? yeah, i do. you might as well have used my caterer and my swing band."""
18117,Susan,that is not true!
17413,Susan,"well, maybe i don't deserve to be happy. a few years ago--there was this car accident--a bad one."
15511,Susan,"edie, why are you torturing that girl?"
14800,Susan,you should have just come clean.
14218,Susan,i just can't.
18261,Susan,go away! i-i don't want to talk to you.
13742,Susan,"me, too."
16751,Susan,i'm julie's mom.
17537,Susan,so you're totally fine with that drawing?
17179,Susan,no.
17520,Susan,maybe you need to get mad more often.
15897,Susan,this should never have happened!
14665,Susan,"well, she was gloating about sleeping with you, and i just wanted to shut her up."
17016,Susan,"is it so horrible living with me? i mean, do i make you so miserable that you can't even face me without numbing the pain?"
18211,Susan,do you know what is a great cure for the blues? cribbage. do you have a cribbage set?
18392,Susan,"dave, please--i'm so sorry about that accident. you don't wanna hurt m.j. or me. you're a good person. i know you."
14959,Susan,"well, i am screwed up, but it wasn't your fault. entirely."
15515,Susan,you know what?it is her.
17429,Susan,"edie, is that really you?"
14406,Susan,huh?
17988,Susan,"okay, sure. uh, where's m.j.?"
16841,Susan,"oh, bless you."
16197,Susan,"yes, we do. you might have gotten your first diaphragm with milk money, but that doesn't give you the right to corrupt my daughter!"
15418,Susan,"he's right.we behaved like children--naughty,stupid children."
18408,Susan,shhhh.keep playing.
13974,Susan,that's good to hear.
18312,Susan,can't this wait? we're about to get marry.
13516,Susan,god bless you!
14983,Susan,oh! i'm your daughter!
16857,Susan,"okay, go."
17217,Susan,excuse me. i have to put something in a box and stick it in the closet.
18092,Susan,no. and--as on the softball team.
16033,Susan,"great. nine o'clock in the morning, and i have to put on a slinky, black cocktail dress. hey, here's an idea. you keep some things in a drawer at my house. would it be okay if i had one here?"
18358,Susan,wow. you're getting married this weekend?
16731,Susan,what if you change it back?
15381,Susan,"i can see that.so,what,did you run out of strangers to beat up on the street,and you're going house to house now?"
13889,Susan,you walked out on your family.
14477,Susan,mike and i got back together.
13979,Susan,"hey, edie!"
16498,Susan,a very bad day.
16816,Susan,"i'm sorry. you gotta understand, for so long, it's just been julie and me, and i've made all the decisions alone. you felt so strongly."
17644,Susan,can we start over?
17715,Susan,"uh, no. no. no, no. no! no, no, no! oh, all right! but no matter what he asks you, promise me you'll say ""no."""
16504,Susan,how we doing on time?
17491,Susan,ah! couple of wusses. i'll handle it myself.
18115,Susan,it's not my fault. i showed this to the school psychologist. she gave it to the principal. my hands were tied.
17414,Susan,"you know what, jackson? you're not gonna say anything i haven't already heard a million times. i-i only told you because i--i just want you to understand why i can't let you in my life."
14497,Susan,"well, i'll just get back to work."
17152,Susan,"julie, dylan's here! study time! i'm-- sorry. that was probably a little louder than it needed to be."
13818,Susan,"well, why don't you enlighten me? you're beautiful, you have more money than you could spend, and you have a husband who adores you!"
15977,Susan,they don't?
17404,Susan,"no, of course not. it's just-- complicated."
15002,Susan,i'm gonna be back in the store next week. i never got that darn horse feed.
18335,Susan,"oh, no need, i will wait."
16101,Susan,what are you saying? you think mike is guilty?
18369,Susan,"uh, yeah. we are in the car, singing."
13799,Susan,"that's just not true. when, when julie was a baby, i, i was out of my mind almost every day."
15243,Susan,"uh,is that really necessary?i mean,do we have to do the whole ring thing?"
15157,Susan,a-and you're stopping yourself why?
17782,Susan,you're home kind of early. is everything okay?
15747,Susan,"uh, well, i, it just, wow. i hear my phone vibrating. i'm sorry, duty calls."
14942,Susan,"oh. oh. i was just researching my book and i, i found the strangest thing. no one with my father's name was ever a merchant marine."
17456,Susan,don't touch me! or my ears! my ears are dead to you.
18004,Susan,good save. let's go.
15754,Susan,"hi, my name's susan mayer. your neighbor told me i could find you here."
14850,Susan,but he's not here. i swear.
16683,Susan,"okay, i got you some appetizers to tide you over. we have mini quiches and beef satay and something called crystal coast shrimp with grits, but it's mostly just grits 'cause i ate all the shrimp on my way over. mike?"
15759,Susan,and that's bad why?
18258,Susan,finish what?
16818,Susan,right. so can we go back to date night?
14295,Susan,"alright, alright."
13573,Susan,"well, don't just run off. come and hang out with us."
14470,Susan,what?
17430,Susan,"mike! uh, what's going on?"
15453,Susan,you're gonna make me go by myself?
13693,Susan,"okay, gimme a break here. i'm just grasping at straws."
14081,Susan,i am so sorry! is everyone okay?
17975,Susan,can't say no.
14492,Susan,"i appreciate what you guys are trying to do, i really do. um, i'm not gonna change my mind. in my life, i've been hurt a lot, karl, and uh, well, it's just taught me to be cynical, and to expect the absolute worst from people, and i don't want to live like that anymore, and when mike asked me to move in with him, i was just happy, just ridiculously happy. i mean, i still am and i want to go with that feeling. i love him and i love him! so i'm gonna expect the best from mike, and i know that he is gonna deliver that in return. okay?"
15138,Susan,i am so sorry.but i'm not sick.
14867,Susan,"oh, gabby, i didn't know you got a sonogram. let me see. oh!"
17951,Susan,"well, we've gotta do something. my editor just quit, and my books are not exactly flying off the shelves. could you pick up some extra shifts?"
18293,Susan,"well, look, maybe--i could talk to mike. i could see if we could work something out."
15344,Susan,"okay, you know what?you should come over to dinner and meet karl,that there is absolutely nothing between us."
16399,Susan,my thigh's getting an inkling.
14007,Susan,"of course, anything. uh, you name it! what?"
13622,Susan,it's complicated. i get it.
14880,Susan,"well, i'll say one thing for us. even with all our problems we're not acting like that."
15742,Susan,susan mayer.
18390,Susan,now keep the volume really high. you don't wanna hear all the boring grown-up talk.
13333,Susan,what?
14531,Susan,you heard the girl.
14156,Susan,"oh! i'm fine, it's good, you just, you know, uh, did, did you see - no! oh, good bye!"
13540,Susan,"um, i'm not really a fan."
14167,Susan,"i decided that my life is way too complicated, and so i'm simplifying. i am getting rid of the clutter."
17904,Susan,"hey, gaby, did you remember to get change? 'cause when i cash in my chips, i don't want to hear you say, ""all i've got is $50s."""
14479,Susan,"how sweet, thanks. why don't you go put these on a plate? oh, and save me one with sprinkles."
17530,Susan,"you're gonna be in magazines, too?"
13896,Susan,we've been divorced over a year.
15618,Susan,hi.
15432,Susan,"oh. oh,no,no,no.this is not happening."
17672,Susan,"jackson, look at me. i'm tipsy. i'm horny. i'm easier than a 5-year-old's homework."
15274,Susan,karl--
16324,Susan,your father's been up there for twenty minutes. are you sure he's okay?
15892,Susan,"oh, uh, mike!"
18324,Susan,"jackson, i have been so worried. where--where are you?"
17425,Susan,fine.
15862,Susan,"okay, mike, i-i am not doing this to upset you. i'm doing this to help."
14248,Susan,"well, neither is she. and if she's not into him, why can't i not be into him."
18007,Susan,i don't know how to make paninis.
15190,Susan,can't you sugarcoat it a little?
14669,Susan,i want you to be happy. i even sort of want edie to be happy.
13894,Susan,gotcha.
17915,Susan,"yard sale! good. you're here. how are you, eli?"
15740,Susan,did i squeeze too hard?
16194,Susan,"wait, did my blonde hair have dark roots?"
16208,Susan,pleading guilty? what kind of a strategy is that?
15265,Susan,"i think i know that ring.that's his grandmother's ring.it's a family heirloom.and,you know,he might just be having it cleaned or something."
13362,Susan,anybody home? i need to borrow sugar?
15748,Susan,dr. mayer?
14294,Susan,"okay, look; i'm just saying i don't think morty cheated on you."
17162,Susan,i've gotta go.
17302,Susan,ah. ah.
14400,Susan,for julie's sake?
15910,Susan,ahh. that's nice. so where were we?
15792,Susan,different?
15566,Susan,"no. no, it isn't.so when am i gonna get the check?'cause i have a lot of rebuilding to do.i need to get started."
15315,Susan,i know. i read the card.
17030,Susan,"if the cover has holes in it, the book is no good."
16764,Susan,what? i'm eating for two.
14941,Susan,"mom, can i ask you a question?"
15492,Susan,"ugh! ooh,out! get out!"
13698,Susan,he's at a rehabilitation center. julie snuck in and actually talked to him.
13986,Susan,"well, you know high school. thank god we leave that behind!"
14126,Susan,"no, no, of course not. i could never think you killed anybody, even i wasn't your alibi, which i am."
17826,Susan,"oh, i'll have what you're having."
18341,Susan,are you insane? why would you do something--
17007,Susan,"bree thinks you're doing drugs. she found this on her kitchen floor, and it's not aspirin."
17199,Susan,"clearly. you know, when you were out on the lawn, you said something about mike."
17307,Susan,i didn't say it was a good plan. do you see the effect she has on me? i just thank god i wasn't drinking coffee. i could've hurt myself.
13430,Susan,"ooh, we just got off on the wrong foot, we're really best buddies now. oh, what a good boy! bongo, are you okay?"
16076,Susan,"bree, you have got to go to the police with all of this."""
15144,Susan,the one who called in the mri room?
13812,Susan,ow! oh!
16705,Susan,"oh,my god.katherine.katherine!"
16522,Susan,"about that, uh, obviously, have been very confused. i finally saw a therapist. actually, it was sort of a court-ordered thing.anyway--well, i need to talk to you."
14442,Susan,what? what were you thinking?
13769,Susan,why do you care so much?
16679,Susan,"no, i wanna start out happy. but clearly, you're upset, and i don't know why."
16438,Susan,"oh, so you're not seeing anyone?"
15468,Susan,karl--uh-oh!
14772,Susan,"you know what? this is one of those times when you find out who your real friends are, so yeah."
16016,Susan,bree said you got a job on the first day. you're such a star! i want details.
18301,Susan,that would be great. just tell him i need an answer quickly 'cause the wedding is monday.
14251,Susan,would you like a glass of water and maybe an excuse to come in and talk to me?
13349,Susan,"well, i've got one."
14570,Susan,what? what is it?
13735,Susan,and i came here to ride the bull!
18394,Susan,mike!
17345,Susan,"well, of course, you don't. you're vanessa. you went through life with a beautiful name. that's why you have such a crackerjack personality."
14025,Susan,"this is easy for you. you're the father of the boy. i'm the mother of the girl. you know, if things get out of hand--"
14670,Susan,"i wanna be happy first! mike and i were supposed to move in together, you know? this was supposed to be my time."
14935,Susan,"well, i've been writing a book. it's sort of autobiographical. really been forcing me to reexamine some of the different things that have made me me, like the fact that my mother had me so young, and i never knew my dad. big stuff like that. i told you about my dad, right? he was a merchant marine, and his platoon was killed in the battle of hanoi?"
16617,Susan,excuse me?
15162,Susan,"no?so--we're talking surgery?yeah, well, i guess i can handle that.people get cut open every day."
15718,Susan,"yes, you did."
13529,Susan,i'm fine.
17872,Susan,what are you getting at?
18430,Susan,just a second?
14528,Susan,"oh, thanks. i'll go do that now."
15125,Susan,yeah?
18144,Susan,wait. stop. could we just rest for a second?
13522,Susan,so i guess i'll just head back home.. bye.
15875,Susan,"no, what are you-- oh, this is ridiculous! i mean, who am i disturbing? it's a coma ward! don't you want them to wake up?!"
16428,Susan,"look, ian is going to come invite you to dinner friday, and you are not--i repeat--not going to accept."
15987,Susan,"julie,that boy drinks,he steals,and now i find him mauling you on my couch?that's it.i forbid you to see him."
16419,Susan,"well, at least it'll keep me from stabbing myself while i look."
14001,Susan,"i was scared that you were sleeping with mike, and so i let myself in, and i, i snuck around, i accidentally knocked a candle over, and the whole, just, i'm so sorry! can you ever forgive me?"
14761,Susan,oh?
18299,Susan,"and then i realized that i would lose my alimony. so unless mike will keep paying me, i can't get married."
15850,Susan,i was in the country. but i'm back now.
17629,Susan,"so we break up, and 15 minutes later you're with someone else? you got over me fast."
14838,Susan,i'm sorry. i've been waiting for you. i'm just a little upset because everybody thinks i'm crazy.
15966,Susan,"okay, you don't have to be nasty. my daughter is inside there."
17361,Susan,"hey, got any plans tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.? 'cause now you do. bree needs about two truckloads of flowers picked up from--what?"
17274,Susan,"the one she won't be helping me with--please tell me it's ""whore."""
13369,Susan,i brought some champagne. i thought we should all have a toast.
17109,Susan,"oh, yeah. every cup needs a coaster. every coaster needs a doily. every doily needs daily laundering. this woman is gonna drive me out of my freakin' hey, roomies. you need help?"
17803,Susan,"hey, everybody! are we ready to have the best time ever?"
14049,Susan,so you and mary alice just kept this to yourselves all these years?
17780,Susan,"oh, don't forget his coat."
13646,Susan,"oh!uh, yes, and a lovely corner it is too. i hate to bother you while you're working but i was just wondering if you could point me in the direction of a pay phone. oh, and if you had some change for this five , preferably quarters?."
17564,Susan,"okay, you know what? this is not jackson's fault. you can't give a 5-year-old a bike and expect him to wait to ride it until you have time. you know, this is what it means to be divorced. it means that sometimes you won't be there."
14741,Susan,"so then i just threw my ice cream at him and ran. well, somebody say something."
18432,Susan,"come on,come on,come on."
15580,Susan,"uh, no. no, i was up."
15393,Susan,it poured.i could have murdered that weatherman.
13599,Susan,i thought we were too. but he's been giving a lot of mixed signals.
14745,Susan,"okay, please, please don't run."
16450,Susan,thanks a lot. now maggie thinks you're charles manson.
17956,Susan,"oh, those. oh, they're stunning."
17124,Susan,thanks.
17832,Susan,yeah. sure. why not?
15204,Susan,"wow, nice to meet you."
17867,Susan,nothing. it's locked. do you have a key?
16364,Susan,you've been awfully quiet since we left the market. is everything okay?
18383,Susan,keys. keys--
16677,Susan,but we didn't agree on this. maybe i can scale things back a bit.
18146,Susan,"because we were starting to become friends and you like to run, and i like to--sit and--one of us had to give."
16416,Susan,yeah.
16412,Susan,i'm good.
14704,Susan,"oh, don't even joke like that."
13662,Susan,what do you think of me?
13827,Susan,"helen, helen, you're here! did they tell you about the change in lineup? i'm going to go last if that's okay."
15879,Susan,"uh, just a little jaunt down memory lane."
15980,Susan,"okay. wait, if we hated the restaurant, then why are we bringing home food?"
17106,Susan,"come on, tom."
15389,Susan,"i did remarry my ex,but it was only because he has great health insurance."
17733,Susan,"oh. crap! i didn't get anyone gifts. but i did give blood, so i'll just remind everybody that i did that."
16011,Susan,"no, i'm not!"
14095,Susan,yeah. i'm gonna go outside and let you rest for a while.
14287,Susan,morty? no!!
15685,Susan,"oh, there he is."
16295,Susan,"no, it's okay. i can get it resized."
16914,Susan,what?
15177,Susan,jim--
14378,Susan,what was that?
16551,Susan,yep.
17235,Susan,so you don't know that your husband tried to kill mike?
18287,Susan,yeah. what?
17587,Susan,"no. no, don't go. that was very sweet of you to consider my feelings. you know what? you're hired."
15575,Susan,you weren't supposed to get that.i stole that back from the mailman.
17008,Susan,really?
14211,Susan,"it doesn't matter, because i will never believe anything you say ever again."
17947,Susan,"yeah. that's quite a tad. but we're starting in the middle of the year, so we'd only pay half, right?"
13368,Susan,"yeah. yeah, but she's fine now. everything's fine now."
13419,Susan,that is a beautiful rose. where did you get it?
16862,Susan,what do you think you're doing? you can't leave yet.
17583,Susan,"i was not born yesterday, pal. you're coming on to me."
15292,Susan,wow.wow.
14690,Susan,"boy, your son really likes to play his hip-hop music loud."
13539,Susan,"by the way, if i didn't make it clear yesterday, i absolutely did not do that thing that you accused me of doing."
18000,Susan,"yes, and imagine my surprise, 'cause the last time i talked to mike, he promised me he was picking up m.j. from school."
16351,Susan,"well, the difference is huge. i mean, one way you're trusting me, and--and the other way, you're trying to make it official."
16161,Susan,excuse me?
16499,Susan,work is great. you could just sign that paper and tell the judge i'm fine.
14096,Susan,"hey, lynette."
15704,Susan,"oh, hey, you weren't supposed to see that."
15142,Susan,you like me?
17906,Susan,i'm in. how much are we talking?
18046,Susan,"why not? i mean, you loved that painting until you found out that i did it, and then you acted totally petty."
14512,Susan,bree.
13644,Susan,"i'd rather take my chances on the street, thank you very much."
14391,Susan,"no, no. what do you want?"
17270,Susan,"oh, well, good. thank you."
15241,Susan,"don't worry,honey.this time,it is strictly a business arrangement."
18254,Susan,what is it?
17927,Susan,locks.
18087,Susan,what?
13459,Susan,we are being as nice as we possibly can to one another.
14382,Susan,"julie, what is zach doing out there? i thought i told you not to speak to him anymore?"
13739,Susan,"oh god, why couldn't i have just have been knocked unconscious?"
17673,Susan,the forehead?
14275,Susan,let's go.
17775,Susan,he's dating a friend of mine.
17697,Susan,it counts.
14058,Susan,no?
17603,Susan,um--no.
17739,Susan,yeah. but what friend? wait. is this a woman friend?
15398,Susan,okay--
13875,Susan,julie!
13360,Susan,edie?
15100,Susan,dr. ron--i need you to pretend there's something wrong with me and admit me for the night.
16912,Susan,don't. we'll just keep looking. i have a feeling we're gonna find that cute little guy.
13709,Susan,susan.
15907,Susan,whatcha doing?
15815,Susan,"why? you know, every time we do, we just get angry."
15764,Susan,this is your day. you can push the ceremony back an hour. now get that detective on the phone and talk things out with orson.
17991,Susan,"well, uh, thank you very much for helping us out. come on, m.j.. it's time to go."
15473,Susan,i don't think so.so i think you should probably stay with edie.and the band is good.you should hire 'em.
14742,Susan,"i should have told mike i saw zach. i'm a horrible person, right?"
13434,Susan,"oh, god. uh, i-stopped and i got this, uh. i am just so sorry for this."
16826,Susan,aw! you have to come. you're the best charades player i know.
14056,Susan,"zach, um, julie is only fourteen years old, and sometimes girls, when they're that age they just don't always make the right decisions. and, um, as her mother, it is my responsibiliity to protect her."
14451,Susan,stop.
13602,Susan,"oh,really? that's great."
14407,Susan,that's it? that's the explanation?
14471,Susan,it was self defence.
15431,Susan,why?
13391,Susan,"yeah, it's sort of a new tradition. i'm working out the kinks."
14203,Susan,oh! oh! oh!
17837,Susan,i don't know. i was drunk.
14560,Susan,okay.
13538,Susan,"no, like i told you before, we're just friends."
16491,Susan,"yeah, and i'm about to do this on purpose, too."
15443,Susan,are-- are you saying--that you're gonna go through with this wedding--unless i tell you not to?
17264,Susan,"oh, really? you guys live one day at a time? is your first thought when she's late that maybe she's out using again or maybe she's dead? it just seems like everything is so fragile right now, which is not the way you want it to be when you're about to have a baby."
16215,Susan,what?
14069,Susan,"oh, poor lynette. she doesn't get a new nanny soon, she's gonna implode."
16924,Susan,i should go.
14648,Susan,"yes, yes, i do."
13639,Susan,"hey,i thought this went to the lab."
16951,Susan,lynette!
15216,Susan,no. it can't wait.
15406,Susan,edie is gonna marry you tomorrow.
15491,Susan,and i regret everything that came of it!
14493,Susan,"so, what do you think we should do for dinner?"
16092,Susan,don't worry. dinner's all taken care of. we're having blanquette de veau and a grand marnier souffl.
14589,Susan,he had a gun in my face for six hours. i know what he looks like.
17195,Susan,"oh, really? you just happened to stumble naked into my front yard?"
17994,Susan,"really? i thought we were using katherine for all sorts of things--sending messages, raising our kid."
17082,Susan,let go of me! aah! oh!
15693,Susan,"i've got everything ready to go-- flowers, candles,elvis costello cd all cued up."
13828,Susan,"i'm sorry, it wasn't my decision."
16739,Susan,i'm in.
18029,Susan,thank you.
16786,Susan,"can you believe it? ugh! let it go. you know, mike and i decided--no party, and that's final."
17746,Susan,i don't understand. carlos might get his sight back. you should be thrilled.
15270,Susan,where's edie?
15285,Susan,i sure did.
16090,Susan,come in.
16110,Susan,"oh. well, that's too bad. well, no harm done then, huh?"
16383,Susan,you?
14864,Susan,"no, mike, mike! come back! come back!"
17726,Susan,jackson--he's still in there. he's in the bathroom.
17820,Susan,"oh, please! i'm bored. mike has m.j., jackson's out of town, and you're gonna need somebody to bitch about bob to."
13514,Susan,"what am i supposed to say to mike, ""i saw you half naked so i thought i'd drop by?"""
16606,Susan,is this a bad time?
13609,Susan,i'm sorry.
13790,Susan,"well, maybe we shouldn't be dating."
16685,Susan,"yeah, it was really impressive. so what are you doing tonight?"
16315,Susan,"no, it is. it's vittles. so, can i get you something to drink?"
16253,Susan,"okay, that's enough."
16006,Susan,i don't know! it's complicated.
17448,Susan,really?
17751,Susan,fine. you're a pig.
14823,Susan,"i was just wondering if, if there's a ball park of how long i will have to wait. a week, a month, after lunch?"
14693,Susan,"well, i don't mean to be technical here, but this show, i mean, it really is supposed to be a family thing, and i hate to point out you're not family."
13747,Susan,she's been in a coma ever since she came out of er. nobody knows when or even if she'll wake up.
18239,Susan,"yeah, and a total shark. the worst thing about our divorce was that i couldn't hire him to represent me."
14424,Susan,"that's not possible, we don't burn candles during the day."
17009,Susan,"oh, thank god! you have no idea where my mind went."
14276,Susan,mom!
17563,Susan,"i'm sorry. m.j. was excited about the bike, so jackson took off the training wheels and taught him. he didn't know."
15816,Susan,"okay, ian, you know what? this is not happening.i am just going to sleep, and you can just drive me home in the morning."
14169,Susan,doesn't matter anymore.
17794,Susan,or maybe you used your corkscrew as much in four months as most people do in a lifetime. ever think of that?
18011,Susan,what is he doing here?
16964,Susan,did you really think i was gonna let you crawl in bed next to me without an explanation for your bizarre behavior?
16833,Susan,"i need a favor. um, i remember you mentioning that you liked your obstetrician. can i get his number?"
17055,Susan,"julie, it's not like it was heroin or crack. it was just pain pills for his shoulder, but we had a talk, and he has totally stopped taking them."
14783,Susan,i don't know. what would you do if this happened to you?
16948,Susan,i'm sorry.
16163,Susan,"okay, bree, i know you're angry, but for the sake of our friendship--"
15797,Susan,huh?
13559,Susan,technically we have nothing to be ashamed about.
15106,Susan,"thank you so much,dr. ron."
16954,Susan,"oh, my god. that's great!"
17333,Susan,oh. forgive me. don't look at me like that. his grandfather just died.
16753,Susan,"i know it sounds weird, but julie says dylan does not remember anything about living here."
16506,Susan,"no, this is horrible! this wasn't supposed to happen! i only let myself fall for ian 'cause i thought mike was lost to me. and then bang! suddenly he wants me back, and now i have this choice that i can't possibly make."
14191,Susan,"martha huber was your best friend. if we could find out who really killed her, wouldn't that be worth the risk?"
16162,Susan,bree!
15878,Susan,"oh, this is hank, and he has very kindly offered to take us on a little field trip today for bucks an hour."
15839,Susan,mike is awake! he's lying there and he's wondering where i am.
17368,Susan,"mike, that is so sweet. mike makes another good point. who is this professor? i don't know him. i am certainly not going to give my daughter to him for a summer. i'm sorry, julie. this is not happening."
17717,Susan,"right, better feelings than you had about wives one, two and three?"
16302,Susan,no.
17493,Susan,really. it's not the first time. juanita's been bullying him.
13706,Susan,"hey, edie!"
16490,Susan,"hey, uh, i waited for that spot while the guy made three phone calls and flossed his teeth. you can't just steal it."
16434,Susan,"mmm! god, that is so good!"
15632,Susan,"oh, wow! i have a neighbor who just asked me over for coffee.i'm sorry.you must think i'm a lunatic."
15717,Susan,"yeah, ah."
18333,Susan,"oh, you guys, i'm sorry. i gotta run."
13579,Susan,"good evening, mrs huber."
14274,Susan,okay.
16661,Susan,"okay, it's your big day, so i'm gonna let that slide."
15573,Susan,edie!why would you do that?!
16791,Susan,mm-hmm?
16039,Susan,"that was good. you. i wanna party with you. hey, i was thinking this afternoon maybe we could go look for that drawer."
13509,Susan,i'm trying a new strategy. i'm playing hard to get.
15372,Susan,okay.
17741,Susan,"i care because you mean a lot to me, and it makes me feel good knowing that two people have found love and happiness. so what's her name? who am i happy for?"
17894,Susan,and i was just trying to be nice and give you a free pass for being such a big slut! edie!
14803,Susan,"well, i'm sorry, but you have."
17965,Susan,"no. so i was going to take these and sell them to try to pay for it, and, yes, now that i'm saying it out loud, i hear how stupid that sounds."
13909,Susan,"okay, now i'm good."
17042,Susan,"yeah, good-looking and smart. only problem is, where is she gonna find someone else like that?"
16575,Susan,"oh. hey--mike. um, listen, i know your cell phone's off, but i--i wanted you to know that i followed you up to the hot springs, and--now i'm lost. you know, in the off chance that i get devoured by a mountain lion, i--i just wanted you to know that, um--i love you. i've always loved you. and i don't want any more drama. and if you take me back, i promise there won't be. unless i get eaten by a mountain lion, and, you know, that'll be dramatic, but it won't be my fault. anyway, um--i hope it's not too late, but if it is, i just--i just want you to know that i am so, so--"
14181,Susan,"i don't know. obviously, a bad guy. somebody really awful, somebody like -- somebody like paul young."
14924,Susan,why are you giving it to me?
14813,Susan,what?
15563,Susan,i don't deserve friends like you.
14038,Susan,yeah.
17206,Susan,"well, if you forgot something, you can just come back for it, or-- you could just not leave."
17416,Susan,okay.
13743,Susan,"well, you sort of interrupted our first date. but up until then, smoking hot tension. sounds pathetic, i know."
15189,Susan,edie!
14221,Susan,"no, no no. that's okay, i don't wanna, you know, litter."
16246,Susan,you're right. i'll keep looking.
16892,Susan,nuts?
15549,Susan,gus? are you okay up there?
16874,Susan,"so anyway, that's why it was so great."
14671,Susan,i don't know. it's really complicated. so you never answered my question. are you in love with her?
17575,Susan,what took you so long? people are gonna be here any minute. i need you to pour the cheap vodka into the expensive bottles.
16398,Susan,"yes. i wanna spend time in your world. i wanna play cricket, and i wanna eat crumpets, and i want to use the word ghastly."
14915,Susan,maybe.
15446,Susan,you're--sick!
13631,Susan,i can't believe zach said that. what else did he tell you?
13354,Susan,"i've told julie a million times not to play in the kitchen. kids, y' know?"
14475,Susan,i need you to check into someone else's background.there is this plumber i know.
16030,Susan,"so you're that close, and you never told him about me?"
14419,Susan,so you mean you and john have still been?
17536,Susan,he does not love jackson more than you. he knows who his father is.
17478,Susan,"ugh. hey. hon. how was the park? wait. hold on. mommy just found her first gray hair. i need you to grab it, yank it and never speak of it again. oh. look at your face. it's scratched. what happened?"
18361,Susan,"i was thinking about what you said, and you were right. it really would do me good to get out of here for a few days"
16140,Susan,"well, he does, and so he's pretending he didn't. that's suspicious, right?"
17586,Susan,you said you liked it.
18125,Susan,"marisa? well, why would he draw a picture of her like this?"
17954,Susan,what's going on?
13898,Susan,"yeah, he is. so what do you want me to sign? oh, i see."
17901,Susan,thanks.
13319,Susan,"i mean, of all people, did he have to bang his secretary? i had that woman over for brunch. gabrielle: it's like my grandmother always said, an erect penis doesn't have a conscience."
16589,Susan,"hey, fran_ois, it's susan mayer. um, call me as soon as you get this. i know i told you that my wedding is off, but it's back on, and i wanna see if you're still available to do the flowers. bye. oh, um, just so you know, ian's not the groom anymore. long story. call me."
14882,Susan,"oh, karl. what do you want?"
18208,Susan,"uh, well, i should probably--put these away before i finish them off. are you sure there's nothing i can do to help you? a load of laundry?"
15641,Susan,"i really don't, tom.is everything okay?"
15133,Susan,okay.thank you.i'd like to get out now.
16608,Susan,francois!
16543,Susan,"okay, carlos--tell me where to find him."
15646,Susan,"oh, hi."
14338,Susan,"i know it's years away. she's youthful and vibrant, thank god. but time flies and one day she won't be able to take care of herself and i'll have to step up."
16898,Susan,"oh, come on, uncle frank.what's the point of having a gay uncle if you're not gonna help me make friends with these guys? oh. uh, mom said that the whole family knew. um, okay. gotta go. love you."
14015,Susan,what are you thinking?
17325,Susan,"me, too. oh, you finally have a name. dr. conner delfino."
15213,Susan,"hi.i thought you should know,i'm getting married."
15220,Susan,"oh, hi.it's nice to meet you."
14353,Susan,"look, i know you're trying to get over morty, but this is not the way to do it.so can you please just go out there and tell him to go home?"
16344,Susan,how do you think tom's gonna feel about that?
14366,Susan,"agh! the perfect capper to the perfect evening, so good night, it's been lovely. and lamont, good luck with all your inventions."
13493,Susan,what? when was this?
15762,Susan,"well, you know what we have to do."
14034,Susan,really?
13778,Susan,ooooeeewwwoooohhh--
16251,Susan,so how are you holding up?
15299,Susan,of course i do.he's smart and funny and kind.
16068,Susan,"will they be expecting stomach cramps, acid reflux, night sweats?"
18025,Susan,hey.
15359,Susan,"all right,but if i catch you guys in there talking about me,you're gonna be the one in a wheelchair."
14582,Susan,"mike, he wanted to kill you."
16516,Susan,"uh, what are we doing here?"
13947,Susan,what?
16311,Susan,i'm so sorry.
15999,Susan,"well, in that case. meet the bad cop."
16236,Susan,"uh, sweetie--i don't think she's gonna make it that long."
15590,Susan,"yeah, he just heard about the fire and came over to help.we're friends."
16002,Susan,what?
17140,Susan,are you always this sarcastic with your clients?
18403,Susan,what if your daughter could see you now? is this how you'd want her to see you? as a monster who could murder an innocent child?
16048,Susan,i am ian's girlfriend.
14952,Susan,i need to you tell me the truth about my father.
14804,Susan,"you'll never lose my friendship, though. i mean that."
15827,Susan,i'd love to go to france someday.
18230,Susan,"that's what we said--but it wasn't true. after the crash, i couldn't find my license. i had switched purses that night, and i had left it at home, and so--mike--told them that he was driving. he took the blame for me. so--i understand guilt. and i want you to understand that edie's death was an awful tragedy. it was not your fault."
13420,Susan,"john? your gardener, he gave you a rose?"
16088,Susan,i don't have to. i know you didn't.
14918,Susan,"karl, last night was two old friends helping each other through a rough patch. that's it."
17996,Susan,no.
15851,Susan,"is something wrong? you, you don't seem happy to see me."
13472,Susan,"i'm coming! karl, what are you doing here? i asked you to come tomorrow."
13520,Susan,oh.
16595,Susan,gaby!
17469,Susan,i don't--
18413,Susan,i love him. you can write that in your little book.
15382,Susan,"if you don't wanna be my boyfriend,fine.don't beat up the only guy who wants to volunteer for the job."
14604,Susan,you want me back?
16903,Susan,"well, long enough for them to worry. you know, the more they worry, the more i'm a hero. get it?"
16341,Susan,you remember.
18080,Susan,the second one?
13849,Susan,"i just, i just want it to be special."
17136,Susan,the jam was bree's idea.
15971,Susan,"thank you. i'm sure lynette's gonna be fine, too."
17609,Susan,it means that someone forgot that we had an agreement to keep things casual.
15982,Susan,because you're british.
14476,Susan,"hey there, edie."
14286,Susan,what? why?
13569,Susan,distant? what do you mean?
16598,Susan,"yep! i promised people a wedding, and they are getting one."
15414,Susan,"well,i should go."
15678,Susan,"so--about that ring you bought, is there anything particular you'd like to ask me?"
13682,Susan,and a lot less sneaky.
16811,Susan,"well, you're right. i'm an adult, and i need to be honest about these things, and i will be--starting tomorrow."
15636,Susan,"honey, i am trying my hardest to stand on my own two feet. all right, i've got six book proposals in the works.i'm gonna try to supervise the rebuilding of this house, but you know, i can't do it without your support. and i want you to be proud of me."
17038,Susan,"well, no rush. you know, just yesterday, i was telling my daughter julie--oh, you know, that is so rude. i-i'm talking about daughter, and you don't even know what she looks like. that's her."
16659,Susan,"gaby, bree went out of her way to buy you that bracelet."
18350,Susan,"i know. but still--i mean, it happened so fast. i just--i wanna make sure that you know what you're doing."
16471,Susan,"testing. one, two, three, testing."
17706,Susan,"you're right. i'll stay out of it. oh, now where is the little girls' room?"
16838,Susan,you don't remember?
14650,Susan,circumstances beyond your control. i get it. so if you'll excuse me.
16825,Susan,sure is. can you come?
14359,Susan,"mom, i'm sorry. i'm just not in the mood to hang out these days."
17197,Susan,"orson, you're staying at my house! there you go."
17062,Susan,no.
15417,Susan,exactly how ugly is this gonna get?
15003,Susan,you do that.
16639,Susan,together!
16270,Susan,"i hadn't really thought a lot about this moment,but when i did--the table we were at didn't have a blood gutter."
13819,Susan,that's a rationalization and you know it! see you at the show.
16539,Susan,i love you.
16149,Susan,"bree--i just want you to know that no matter what, your friendship means the world to me."
16015,Susan,"hey, you're back! i'd give you a hug, but i'm really sweaty. so how was new york?"
17577,Susan,fine. you can have a little space in the closet. i think i've got some clothes from the '80s i'm ready to part with.
18219,Susan,"uh, what? you don't want the license?"
13694,Susan,"honey, it's up to his father."
16080,Susan,what's going on?
16541,Susan,"oh, my god. what--where is he now?"
13353,Susan,"uh, oh god. that's him. how am i gonna stuff up the sink--"
15268,Susan,"oh,hi. um,do you see that man over there?dark hair,handsome.i need you to slip this to him without anybody noticing."
13744,Susan,any particular reason?
13814,Susan,"you're sleeping with him, aren't you?"
14616,Susan,"i'll take care of it, i promise."
13753,Susan,what time do you want me to be ready?
15819,Susan,"that we work hard, and we deserve to relax."
17127,Susan,"oh! this is a fix-up? well, i just--it never would have occurred to me, you know, because of the vast age difference. but, hell. why not? life is short. certainly shorter for walter."
14949,Susan,"mom, don't walk away from me."
13833,Susan,"okay, you want me to talk? you're going to find helen rowland, and you're going to tell her the truth, before everyone in this neighborhood thinks that i'm the one sleeping with an underage boy."
18111,Susan,okay. so--that man must be a doctor making the bloody man all better?
15197,Susan,i'm saying a little prayer.
14163,Susan,i'm sure. now go.
15043,Susan,thirty-eight.
18016,Susan,"no, not evil. devious. well, you know, i hate to tell you, but your big plan is not gonna work, 'cause from now on, m.j. is either at my house or mike's. he is no longer allowed to be here."
13623,Susan,"i told him another man asked me out, it was the perfect opportunity for mike to be jealous. and nothing."
17792,Susan,"oh, looky there. lou gehrig."
18336,Susan,"no, i need to talk to mike. now you could flush the toilet and try to get him out there."
14788,Susan,"lonnie, are you here? it's susan. lonnie?"
17791,Susan,"uh, yeah. it's--round."
14469,Susan,right. i appreciate you talking to me.
14776,Susan,"i know. i know. it's just, lonnie's family. you know he's always been there for me. he paid my rent when i was waiting for my first royalty check. he called me everyday when karl left. i mean, i just owe him so much."
13767,Susan,"maybe i am being silly, but going to a hotel with a man is a big deal to me. what if mike is hiding something?"
17052,Susan,what?
16332,Susan,you mean a prenup?
17005,Susan,so i'm thinking that it would be better if you could get her to research somebody else in her family.
13387,Susan,"no, it's fine, i get it."
15444,Susan,this is insane!
15961,Susan,"excuse me, what's going-- what's going on?"
17393,Susan,"you know, you're a guy, and we just had hot sex, and i didn't force you to cuddle. so run! go! brag to your friends."
17078,Susan,"what's the problem? let's see. you lied to me. uh, your drug dealer almost dated my daughter. you lied to me some more, and then i find out that you hit up my best friend's husband for more pills."
13450,Susan,i think we should go through with it.
14412,Susan,i couldn't agree more.
15080,Susan,go!
13481,Susan,"no, you're the one who's been humiliating yourself, karl, why don't you see that? you walked out on your family. people think you're scum, not me. so worry about yourself, i'm okay with me. i can walk down the street and walk my head high."
16325,Susan,i set your mother on fire.
14178,Susan,"i hate 'em all. look at them just leering at us. they're so damn cocky, like they know they have the upper hand."
15956,Susan,you have a lot of meetings anyway. we'll go some other time. i can't leave julie right now.
16977,Susan,so you killed him?
16462,Susan,no. it--it was days ago.
14348,Susan,argh!
16268,Susan,"ian, are you proposing to me?"
13379,Susan,shut up.
14920,Susan,"uh, the big news?"
16734,Susan,"yep,we're doomed."
16221,Susan,he's matured-- to the tune of a billion dollars. please do this--for mike.
16523,Susan,"i am. i'm gonna marry ian. believe me, this wasn't easy, especially when you started to remember how it was between us. maybe if the timing had been different--"
17048,Susan,oh. he's coming back tomorrow. don't you think he would be perfect for julie?
18255,Susan,i have to go upstairs.
14209,Susan,"see? now that's a lie, too, because there were plenty of right moments."
14678,Susan,i'm sorry. what?
17323,Susan,"he's a guy who--""killed six, then self."" well, i give up. he's not gonna get a name. when we want him to come, we'll just whistle and say, ""here, boy."""
18416,Susan,"listen, i know being dramatic is the birthright of every teenager, but come on--"
1852,Bree,"andrew, didn't run away.i, dropped him off in the middle of nowhere,told him that i couldn't be around him anymore,and then--i drove off.so i just need a little time to forget what i've done,and then i can sleep again."
1826,Bree,"well,i'm sorry about the noise.it's just that danielle doesn't want balloons,and i'm kind of pressed for time."
3275,Bree,"i am sorry, but am i supposed to sit by while she degrades his body and his mind?"
3787,Bree,what's that?
1508,Bree,i have the same recipe for english plum pudding.it takes six hours to prepare.how would she have time to make all of this and everything else that we ate today?this is not the pudding of an honest woman.
784,Bree,he makes me beat him with a riding crop and i let him. it's no wonder you're perverted. look at who your parents are.
2506,Bree,"well, maybe she blocked it out. did something bad happen to her when she was young?"
3730,Bree,a check. i understand you and tom are going through some rough times.
3862,Bree,"oh, that's all right. i'll just go to the store."
2791,Bree,"again, not to pry, but--"
88,Bree,hello zach! i hope this isn't a bad time.
17,Bree,"rex. seeing as you're the head of this household, i would really appreciate you saying something."
597,Bree,"well, then, whose is it? it didn't just magically appear in my laundry basket."
245,Bree,it sure is nice and toasty in here.
2754,Bree,what a lovely ceremony. i'm deborah's friend bree. i have what may strike you as a very odd request.
2560,Bree,what is it?
879,Bree,"already? wow, good for her."
3257,Bree,"here they come, finally."
3963,Bree,orson's not exactly the bar-fight type. he's more of a raised voices at-a-cheese-tasting type.
3156,Bree,"but that's just it, orson. if i forgive you, then i'm forgiving what you did to mike. i can't do that. and-- and you wouldn't want me to. i mean, be honest with yourself. if i took you back now, i wouldn't be the woman you love."
1604,Bree,"my name is bree,and i am an alcoholic."
248,Bree,"oh, rex, oh baby, stop, i just need a minute."
2024,Bree,we know what you think. now would you please leave us alone?
2978,Bree,who put pear slices in the waldorf salad?
2493,Bree,"oh,my baby!"
3315,Bree,"orson, i have amazing news. the chamber of commerce just called."
823,Bree,"it's okay. george has a girlfriend. you brought her, didn't you?"
1575,Bree,"okay,take care."
958,Bree,"reverend, if you don't call her on that incredibly insensitive comment, i'm gonna lose it."
4,Bree,"of course, i will need the baskets back once you're done."
2388,Bree,no reason.
484,Bree,"i mean, what are the odds? first mary alice and then mrs. huber? i mean, it's shocking."
3743,Bree,you know what might be even better? my publisher has been begging me to do a local launch for my book.
3504,Bree,good. i can check that off my list.
177,Bree,is your father here? we were scheduled to do a patrol today.
1711,Bree,"you know,it never ceases to amaze me how people can turn their backs on their own family.i mean--but it happens every day,doesn't it?"
554,Bree,look at the guilt that she must've lived with.
3357,Bree,"oh, that's not until 4:00."
2134,Bree,danielle.
957,Bree,"he's going to do more than mention it. that's the part he'll focus on. in fact, i think three anecdotes from rex's childhood is more than enough."
2606,Bree,"i knew it! phyllis--rex's mother. ever since he died, she's been trying to buy children's affection."
743,Bree,"lynnette, is there a problem?"
389,Bree,"lynette, for the first time in years you finally have some free time, and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids."
1542,Bree,i didn't have to.he committed suicide.
2149,Bree,carolyn. this isn't a very good time. i'm baking.
1858,Bree,"well, it seems that my son stole it from your yard."
3633,Bree,"you know, we actually have some very comfortable patio furniture in the backyard--along with a place to put your recyclables."
2965,Bree,"it's a lot of work, exhausting and completely worth it."
3531,Bree,"well, if it's so simple, what are we waiting for?"
217,Bree,"zach said mary alice killed herself because of something that he had done, something bad. is there anyone else who'd know what he was talking about?"
2602,Bree,oh!
975,Bree,you look magnificent.
3205,Bree,the cooking show agreed to redo my segment. i wanna make sure it's perfect this time.
1319,Bree,let me take your coat.
3905,Bree,"well, i'm all for saying a few nice things--but you were never really friends. you and edie clashed right from the start."
1196,Bree,"you know what, george? we're gonna have a great time, because there's tons of fun stuff we can do that doesn't involve sex."
385,Bree,"options! i'm not a mutual fund, rex!"
1686,Bree,what?! why?
3649,Bree,"oh, it's nothing you wouldn't do."
3277,Bree,that's your mom way back when she was your age.
3108,Bree,"would you mind terribly if i took your hand? maybe that way, he'll finally get the idea that i've moved on."
1552,Bree,"sure.just--just a moment,okay?"
3178,Bree,andrew-- do we have a backup pie?
1281,Bree,how did this get in the paper?
3465,Bree,"i have to admit, i had some reservations about us working together, but this has succeeded beyond my wildest dreams."
719,Bree,nowhere in their brochure did it say that we were expected to attend.
3543,Bree,i didn't think it was my place. i thought katherine should tell you.
2752,Bree,and this rotating spice rack? those little airplane bottles of vodka fit perfectly in the back.
1741,Bree,"no, i'm not."
976,Bree,--we don't really care what happens behind closed doors.
2867,Bree,"walter. walter. walter, i'm begging you. please. i'm living like a vagabond in a teenage girl's bedroom. i'm sleeping under a poster of orlando bloom. you can't leave me."
3961,Bree,i know.
2368,Bree,why not? and what the hell was that on the porch?!
2590,Bree,it's the only thing she asked for.
1906,Bree,excuse me.do you have the time?
3615,Bree,it's a pleasure to meet you.
1044,Bree,thank you.
2304,Bree,"no, i wasn't. they arrested mike for the murder of monique polier."
4046,Bree,like i could finally take it off and be myself.
1585,Bree,"andrew,did i hear the bell?oh,hello."
363,Bree,"excuse me,"
2489,Bree,"no,no,no!it's just,uh--oh,it's a little barbecue sauce."
206,Bree,uh?
292,Bree,"oh, no? that's mr. conlan, the locksmith. he's been very helpful today. of course, i could give you the new keys, which would mean you'd have to adhere to my rules, which would include giving back your father's gifts."
857,Bree,"why don't we start doing things again, as a couple?"
278,Bree,"um, all this, um, wine is, uh, giving me a headache."
2395,Bree,baby?!
68,Bree,"well, why don't you move back upstairs and sleep in our bed?"
500,Bree,"now before i fire a handgun, i like to go over a few of the basics just to make sure i'm ready. okay? so, number one, a strong stance."
3733,Bree,"then it's not a loan, it's a gift. don't you have a birthday coming up?"
361,Bree,what's that smell? have you been smoking marijuana?
1159,Bree,hi. the kids are gone. we have the house all to ourselves tonight.
701,Bree,"what i want, what i have always wanted is for you to be happy. and you're not. and i have no idea how to help you."
3195,Bree,"katherine, i'm sure your wrist is just fine."
1405,Bree,you didn't know?
3534,Bree,"orson, dear, because of the way your nose was broken during the fire, you now snore."
117,Bree,andrew?!
2980,Bree,"""take over""? what in god's name have you done with my french onion soup?"
220,Bree,"oh, hey there, you two!"
3232,Bree,what?
3417,Bree,come in.
3987,Bree,"i want you to say that for $300 an hour, you have some lawyer tricks up your sleeve to help me protect my business."
233,Bree,"oh, maisy does love to rule her little kingdom."
364,Bree,it's the container you'll be urinating into.
3796,Bree,"that's why you wanted to know the names of my pets? orson hodge, you are shameful."
528,Bree,you only demanded the good china because you know i love it.
231,Bree,"oh, i take it you've met maisy gibbons."
2331,Bree,"i'm so sorry to keep you waiting, but i don't want to introduce you until all my guests are here."
2509,Bree,"oh, no need, dear. i always bring dessert. oh, i'm thinking my lemon meringue pie."
2646,Bree,"of a the gay men in the world, we have to get the two without taste."
268,Bree,"rex, this was practically assault."
4122,Bree,oh my god. you're bleeding
1040,Bree,"well, apparently, they want to do an autopsy. they don't think that he had a heart attack. they think that somebody was poisoning him."
2020,Bree,how do you know him?
1680,Bree,"oh,hello."
1859,Bree,"well, don't tell him that.if he doesn't feel guilty he'll never learn shame."
3978,Bree,"oh, you know, i just remembered some business i have to discuss with andrew."
3106,Bree,"i didn't know she left you. yes, for our korean grocer. i'll tell you, sometimes this merciful god of ours has one sick sense of humor."
1971,Bree,okay.
317,Bree,"well, more importantly, is there any good news about juanita?"
3996,Bree,"no, thanks, i don't drink."
3771,Bree,what's that?
2365,Bree,everybody has questions. susan and i aren't even speaking because of it.
2682,Bree,"oh, well, thank you. orson and i would be delighted."
1362,Bree,'those are my panties.how did you--''
585,Bree,so? was it good for you too?
1283,Bree,rex has only been dead for seven weeks.
3839,Bree,bruce's tape recorder.
1705,Bree,"eleanor,please--"
986,Bree,my electrician? why were you on the phone sobbing to my electrician?
3052,Bree,edie!
685,Bree,they're brochures for youth detention centers.
2018,Bree,"you're upset, aren't you? you're still thinking about what i said at the church."
1033,Bree,"well, it was a marriage. of course there were problems."
1900,Bree,"oh, it's not for me, it's for danielle. that hair is going back to the color god intended."
2838,Bree,"well, adam is not here, and there is a tornado coming. and as you may have gleaned from the batteries and bottled water, that bathroom is where we are planning on riding it out. so would you please be a dear and come on out?"
2154,Bree,"well, thank you, darling. but if you think for one second that i'm gonna break bread with that malicious, pill-popping shrew, you're out of your mind."
3475,Bree,"before anything got serious, i made a point of turning the camera off."
1334,Bree,"don't lie to me, george. you've been riding up and down this street for the last hour."
3135,Bree,"all right, you can all wipe those smug looks off your faces, because every one of you has just become my employee."
1802,Bree,"i packed up some of your things.there's also,um,an envelope in here with some money,and that should tide you over until you get a job."
1901,Bree,"oh, i will tie her down if necessary.i'm also thinking of checking her body for piercings while i'm at it."
3166,Bree,i'm home!
1784,Bree,"well,he did falsely accuse me of child abuse.i would say we're even.wouldn't you,andrew?"
437,Bree,george? would you go out to dinner with me?
3989,Bree,split the pot.
1482,Bree,"danielle, that's ridiculous,sweetheart."
839,Bree,because i'm married! people would talk.
1061,Bree,"sort of. well, i think the police now have a different theory, which is if i wasn't poisoning rex on my own, then maybe you were helping me."
3544,Bree,i'm sorry.
1397,Bree,i saw what you did with your friend.
1161,Bree,"uh, no, go ahead."
2140,Bree,"well, that hotel room was small, and you seemed happy enough there. oh, and i trust you to be discreet. you wouldn't want your wife find out about this and use it against you in your divorce."
1760,Bree,"yes, it is."
2886,Bree,"and poor walter just had his heart broken, so if it takes you being nice to him to get our house fixed, then--"
3136,Bree,"so after the ceremony, we'll open up the buffet--"
3576,Bree,"why the secrecy? did you think i'd disapprove? the man's a doctor, for heaven sakes. you've done better than i did."
2818,Bree,i can't believe this.
1470,Bree,except for you.you're really good at it.
1590,Bree,this is ridiculous.can't you see this is a performance?
338,Bree,"oh, baby. nobody likes to admit that they can't handle the pressure."
2232,Bree,"please, stay for dessert. i'll work on orson, and we'll discuss this together."
493,Bree,"i can't accept this, george! this is an antique. it's too valuable."
3800,Bree,"no, i'm just saying you're worth--less. i'm sorry, honey. i'm just being honest."
413,Bree,it went well. the surgeon says you're going to be as good as new.
1175,Bree,"actually, i have not considered that because that's idiotic!"
1238,Bree,"no. true love is great, but at this point in my life, i think i'd rather just go to the opera."
1759,Bree,"no, no, i'm--i'm good.i'm just, um, here to pick up my friend peter.he's locked himself in your bathroom,and i'm here to take him home."
3546,Bree,"either tell mike how you feel or move on, because that's what he's trying to do, and it's not fair to stop him. you need to make a decision, susan. and i need to get back to my nap."
3144,Bree,"okay, so you have another one of those in the truck? thank you."
3697,Bree,i'd be happy to. any special requests?
1861,Bree,this is my husband rex.
1,Bree,"paul, zachary."
1363,Bree,''where did you find them?''
752,Bree,"green. i'll go with green, everybody loves green."
46,Bree,"oh, have i?"
619,Bree,who were you planning on having sex with?
2274,Bree,monique polier?
326,Bree,"honey, you put a woman into a coma. surely that arouses some kind of emotion!"
845,Bree,i saw you at alfredo's yesterday.
1355,Bree,"yes, you did. but that's not what i'm talking about. you killed rex. but i know it wasn't totally your fault because you're not well. so, if you'll just be honest with me, i can forgive you. it'll be the hardest thing i've ever done, but i'll do it. but you have to, you have to tell me the truth."
1120,Bree,"andrew, what are you doing?"
2169,Bree,i'm so happy we did this.
1461,Bree,"oh,for goodness sakes!"
1765,Bree,yes.why would you wanna come to a place like this?
1601,Bree,"if i really thought that,i'd get a gun right now and kill us both."
1480,Bree,"oh, honey, what happened wasn't my fault.there's no way i could've predicted how betty would react."
3997,Bree,"i'm bringing you business, karl. try not to insult me."
3307,Bree,"they've come up with this whole marketing plan--radio, print, book signings."
3658,Bree,you think you're excited? just imagine the salesman who overcharged you.
1669,Bree,"but,peter--"
2038,Bree,you know you could show a little compassion.your brother is out there on the streets struggling to survive!
393,Bree,fine. why do you ask?
2700,Bree,"i suggest you get an air rifle. it won't kill it, but it'll sting it enough to keep it away for good."
3583,Bree,"andrew, you can't criticize my parenting and then deny me the chance to make up for it. orson and i will expect you at 8:00."
3637,Bree,"who, undoubtedly, already have doctors, just like your patients in fairview have you."
345,Bree,"well, he's doing a fabulous job!"
1368,Bree,"oh, hold it. what are you gonna do with that?"
1098,Bree,"george, you have to have this. it's absolutely scrumptious."" ""ummm, ummm!"
1471,Bree,"well,you moved into your house in the middle of the night.god knows what you moved in that you didn't want anybody to see.people hear sounds coming at all hours from there.and,oh,what was the last one?oh,right--they found a dead body in front of your home.everybody talks about the applewhites,but nobody can figure out exactly what you people are hiding.so congratulations.your secrets are safe--for now."
1507,Bree,"oh, come on. do you honestly expect us to believe that you had the time to prepare a 6-course meal for 10 women?even i couldn't make this and i have time to get ready for a party"
1664,Bree,"i got,uh,your message that you wanted to see me before the meeting started."
192,Bree,what did you do??? zach? sweetheart?
634,Bree,"uh, actually, i would prefer if you didn't."
3370,Bree,thanks.
3281,Bree,"i've been asking myself that all day. maybe she's afraid if you get big, you'll leave home and go play for the red sox."
2235,Bree,what are you doing?
2021,Bree,mm-mm.
656,Bree,"maisy, i didn't mention it when you were having financial troubles because i thought it would embarrass you."
1882,Bree,what do you mean?
1178,Bree,"oh so you uh, think i'm crazy?"
1632,Bree,no one is ever gonna believe a word of that.
3101,Bree,"well, then appeal to his sense of reason, because the name ""maynard"" doesn't go with the name of ""delfino"". one is german and the other is italian, and we all know what happens when those folks get together."
2903,Bree,this is a conversation that could benefit from some homemade chocolate chip cookies.
2231,Bree,"paprika! there, it's out!"
2784,Bree,"and if you're as tired as you say you are, then you're bound to sleep better tonight."
2726,Bree,"orson, you better take benjamin to the other room before my friends run out of lies. ah."
47,Bree,"um, doc,um?"
1910,Bree,"oh, well, i certainly would not want that to happen.what's your name?"
312,Bree,"all right, then what's the appropriate punishment for a child who drives over a woman?"
115,Bree,dinner is on the table.
136,Bree,he hung up on me.
1060,Bree,"well, that's why i took the polygraph, to prove to them that i was innocent."
261,Bree,why?
694,Bree,"well, you should assume that it is."
3097,Bree,"it's funny how having a man in the house can make you feel safer, no matter how retiring or easily spooked he might be."
1998,Bree,"orson, i moved the furniture back!"
447,Bree,"oh, my, they're exquisite. compost and eggshells?"
653,Bree,continue to be discreet.
2081,Bree,yes. i left you two messages. didn't you check your voice mail? he woke up from his coma.
216,Bree,"zach, why did you do this?"
3434,Bree,"well, where did you meet?"
2975,Bree,it's interesting. i can't really picture that though.
4102,Bree,not by resorting to physical violence. i would never have given my permission for that.
2470,Bree,"no,i mean they're stickley.it means they have taste."
4011,Bree,"now, m.j., we can find faults with all our friends if we nitpick. what do you say? will you invite him? would you like some ice cream with your macaroons? because i could make that happen."
3441,Bree,then why are you whispering?
2238,Bree,how can you be so cold?
2514,Bree,what happened to the pie that i brought?
2959,Bree,"and it meant a lot that you came to me for guidance, and--i'm sorry that i wasn't there for you. i want you to have faith in me and our friendship."
1025,Bree,suspicious?
3013,Bree,"prove me wrong, sweetie. prove me wrong."
3215,Bree,gaby--
3664,Bree,"well, we've got 15 minutes till the news is on. why not? i still can't get over the way alex behaved this morning. ""emasculating."" i' never heard such nonsense. don't you think so?"
749,Bree,how can you say that it doesn't matter? of course it matters.
2521,Bree,"i have been here for hours trying to replicate her recipe, and nothing has even come close!"
4128,Bree,that's very sweet.
678,Bree,hi.
590,Bree,"um, how about boise?"
186,Bree,"it was right before christmas as a matter of fact. we were all singing carols and the dog was howling, because everyone in my family sings off-key except for me.anyway, it was just a terrible ruckus.so no-one noticed when my mother wenta cross the street to give the neighbour their gift. the next thing we heard were brakes screeching."
195,Bree,"zachery, it's alright!"
3213,Bree,"see? the ship has already sailed. oh, don't be hurt. it's my professional name. in this house, i will always be mrs. hodge. now-- would it help if mrs. hodge cooked you your favorite pot roast tonight?"
2742,Bree,"yes, um, can you tell me who i would talk to about having my baby circumcised?"
309,Bree,they sure didn't turn out like we expected them to.
3155,Bree,"and you were right. i did. you just think i'm being stubborn, don't you? making you jump through hoops when it's so clear we belong together."
2399,Bree,you raped my husband.
1034,Bree,"no, you may not record this."
3925,Bree,so you're not--trying to start up something?
2290,Bree,"oh, thank god!"
1294,Bree,"oh, well, that announcement was a bit premature."
213,Bree,"hi,zach. i just wanted to see if everything was alright."
855,Bree,"oh, honey."
1360,Bree,"'oh,um--well,um,it was very good of you to tell me in person,truly.''"
2419,Bree,"oh, that's right. is orson here?"
2305,Bree,"the other night, you wanted a chance to explain everything. well, here it is, and i want it all. if i find out you've left anything out, then i will ask for that divorce."
1019,Bree,"yes, let's."
2096,Bree,"danielle! danielle, he is your history teacher, and he is 35 years old!"
1608,Bree,"hi.before coming to these meetings,i never realized how messy substance abusers can be."
1031,Bree,she's my mother-in-law. of course she said horrible things about me.
1742,Bree,"look, you don't have to worry about peter,not while he's with me."
3435,Bree,"peter's a felon? but he's so refined, so handsome."
1230,Bree,"see, george, um, the thing is--"
1644,Bree,i was just giving you a little kiss.
1262,Bree,do you ever think you might like it?
1290,Bree,"maybe, but why risk it?"
699,Bree,no!
3416,Bree,"when you're done with that, the oven could use a really good scrubbing."
1687,Bree,"dad,you don't understand.this has gotten really ugly."
3298,Bree,it's how i'm known.
3737,Bree,"well, that's an intriguing offer."
1092,Bree,"andrew, don't you have a meet at the swim club?"
2009,Bree,"if the three of you don't drop this right now, i will never forgive you."
3763,Bree,what's that supposed to mean?
2361,Bree,i will not have that woman as a neighbor. you have got to do something.
2870,Bree,walter's gay?
1972,Bree,"ah.oh, no!"
1201,Bree,what's wrong?
3256,Bree,"please, just don't take him! benjamin's all i have!"
1347,Bree,"oh, thank you."
1817,Bree,"honey, where am i gonna put all of his things?and, you know, he might come back at some point."
2907,Bree,"susan! look, i don't mean to pry, but given what i know about you and adam, i'm surprised he was the one to do the leaving."
3754,Bree,"oh, perhaps you do, but my recipe specifies fresh grated."
1500,Bree,"but, betty, the police are looking for him.he escaped from that facility they sent him to."
621,Bree,"well, if that's the type of boy he is, then good riddance."
439,Bree,"oh, him. well, we're separated."
953,Bree,bye.
3927,Bree,"oh, well, my schedule is just unreal, what with the catering company and looking after benjamin."
2830,Bree,"so, um, why on earth would katherine treat you so dreadfully?"
3711,Bree,i'll learn. and i want it to be more than just a cookbook. i want to talk about traditional values and give helpful hints about homemaking.
2227,Bree,"well, thank you! it did win me the blue ribbon at the gourmet county cook-off."
802,Bree,"do you know, i've finally convinced rex to buy his first orchid."
2403,Bree,your drink was laced with pills for--erectile dysfunction.
881,Bree,"no, and i know guns and that wound was not self-inflicted."
853,Bree,"what do you think, rex? i chose green so that it will work whether gabrielle has a boy or a girl."
1139,Bree,"oh, please don't talk to me about tests. rex was not poisoned and no one i know believes that he was."
1303,Bree,"that's what i thought, at first, but then having had time to think about it, i can't understand why she'd go to so much trouble. i mean, what would her motive be?"
2303,Bree,orson. why haven't you returned any of my calls?
1236,Bree,"well, i know it sounds rash, but, well, there's something comfortable about george. we share the same tastes and interests. oh, and best of all, he loves the opera."
2436,Bree,what?
3625,Bree,fine! i call easter.
1222,Bree,um hmm.
1337,Bree,all ready?
3582,Bree,nice try. tell alex we dress for dinner.
2450,Bree,there. now you have something new.
844,Bree,edie! hi.
1233,Bree,"it was just awful. george had a ring. his mother and her friend were there with champagne. if i had said no, it would have devastated him."
2571,Bree,"oh, hi, gaby. katherine and i were just talking about the old days. so when you were living with your aunt, was dylan's father with you?"
2578,Bree,itch. itch.
2124,Bree,they're sticking a tube down her throat. do you still think this is funny?
1131,Bree,"look, i know it's an imposition, but danielle is away on a class trip and andrew is back at camp hennessey for a little refresher course. well, it's just gonna be a very brief and, and dignified ceremony and i was hoping that you could say a few words and, um, i'm gonna read a poem."
3006,Bree,"that's everything, i guess."
298,Bree,"we have to get rid of the car. but we can't sell it. the police might find it, and there could be dna. we take the car to a bad part of town. we'll leave the keys in the ignition and the doors unlocked. if the police don't find it, we'll get the insurance money, and if they do, it wasn't in our possession. anyone could have hit mrs. solis."
2406,Bree,"orson, i know you're embarrassed, but what they did to you was a crime."
3471,Bree,"i don't see why not. i mean, everything's, uh, pretty much done here. you can go now if you like."
3709,Bree,why wouldn't i be? people are always complimenting me on my cooking.
778,Bree,"then what are we supposed to do? just stand by while he starts dating boys? and by the way, the correct word is not gay, it's sodomy."
2367,Bree,"oh, you're a good husband."
2859,Bree,thank god.
3457,Bree,"charlie, we wouldn't accuse you unless we had concrete evidence, and thanks to my diligent partner here, we do."
4097,Bree,"i don't know. but i swear to you, we may have our differences, but i would never hire someone to attack you. you have to believe me."
2182,Bree,"oh, how did she fall?"
3911,Bree,"um, i ran into her once, unexpectedly--in a place i never thought i'd be."
3589,Bree,"well, orson and i thought it would be nice to share this special occasion with some dear friends."
3278,Bree,"oh! uh, a hot dog."
3024,Bree,and--it worked beautifully. i'm in.
927,Bree,"rex, you don't have to say anything."
2809,Bree,"andrew, i understand you're angry with me about what i said, but--i do have a good reason for wanting to raise benjamin differently. i mean, let's be honest. you put me through hell."
3447,Bree,you will.
4020,Bree,wouldn't it be easier to just have him killed?
2132,Bree,powerful?
1969,Bree,i'm a republican!
3304,Bree,mmm. oh. mmm. you have a good day.
1118,Bree,george.
3705,Bree,"and i think you would appreciate my value more if, for once, you had to cook your own food and wash your own clothes."
2944,Bree,"no, no problem. just talking to my friend."
2641,Bree,parenting tips from you? that's rich.
642,Bree,"tisha. tisha. oh, i can tell by that look on your face you've got something good. now, come on, don't be selfish."
409,Bree,"i see."" ""you know, you are pretty brazen for a woman who just admitted, however tacitly, that she just slept with my husband. if i told anyone in this neighborhood, they would never speak to you again."
2890,Bree,"fine, and if you can get him to come in on time and under budget, i'll throw in surround sound."
1391,Bree,i did.betty never rsvp'd.
794,Bree,"oh, my heavenly days. rex, look, it's george."
3188,Bree,never heard anything so absurd.
667,Bree,"well, you should have thought of that before you left a personal check on maisy gibbons' nightstand."
2479,Bree,there's no need.the baby's just not kicking right now.
2316,Bree,so you're alma. where have you been all this time?
4030,Bree,"i, uh, took some of my silver off the mantle, and it threw off the balance."
648,Bree,"hello, maisy."
2183,Bree,why would she attack you?
2662,Bree,then why would she want the child?
812,Bree,"yes, we have. . and you still don't know when i need you to lie."
302,Bree,how is juanita doing?
3729,Bree,"well, it is pretty amazing!"
611,Bree,"you've been spending a lot of time together lately, haven't you?"
3458,Bree,"you're more than ""like"" fired. you're fired. and, of course, we want our money back."
3,Bree,"well, the least i could do is make sure you boys had a decent meal to look forward to in the morning. i know you're out of your minds with grief."
2889,Bree,bless you.
3932,Bree,you have every right to hate me.
1991,Bree,the buffet is open.
2066,Bree,we'll need a name for this drama camp.
3828,Bree,"well, i just wanted to get you together with tom here. i thought you two might hit it off."
1460,Bree,i have been through enough humiliation for one day.i hope you have a better suggestion than that.
3899,Bree,"actually, no. i'm not selling."
1373,Bree,he hasn't got a clue.
3604,Bree,hey there. do you have a second?
1581,Bree,"not until you're 21.and if i had my way, you wouldn't get your hands on it until you're 50.i mean,we both know you're gonna waste every penny of it."
1626,Bree,you took that out of my purse.
1578,Bree,"oh,well,if you need a ride to school, i'm happy to drive you."
3538,Bree,you don't have an uncle!
3477,Bree,"obviously, you turned it back on."
2485,Bree,that was danielle.now she wants us to send a dvd player for her room.
494,Bree,"it's so lovely. i mean, look at the handle. is that mother of pearl?"
999,Bree,"hi. oh, hi, lynette."
254,Bree,i was there. i was willing. normal men don't say no to that.
3289,Bree,no! of course not.
1619,Bree,"you didn't know them during the good times.i mean,there was such a spark between them,so much passion."
3139,Bree,"uh, why don't i let you two work this out?"
3599,Bree,don't give me that. you've been whispering to each other all night. you obviously know alex. how?
2541,Bree,"well, i stopped by katherine's last night just to get a recipe, and you'll never believe what i overheard."
2012,Bree,i just need a moment.
43,Bree,"good, i'm gonna go make myself some, uh, warm milk. would you like something to drink?"
27,Bree,"yes, well, i feel badly about that. i told you, mrs. huber came over and i got distracted. it was a mistake."
4096,Bree,i had nothing to do with that.
574,Bree,you had an affair. you went to another woman for sex to give you something i couldn't. at least have the decency to tell me what that something is.
1772,Bree,"if i hadn't been in the house,he could've raped her--or worse."
2019,Bree,"i'm sorry, but i had to ask."
547,Bree,"aside from the adultery, yes."
915,Bree,hi. what are you doing here?
914,Bree,there. now we can go.
1136,Bree,detective barton. what are you doing here?
1051,Bree,what does that have to do with anything?
3393,Bree,you would do that?
2979,Bree,"katherine, a waldorf salad is made with apples. it's tradition."
805,Bree,no. he just wants to be friends. he told me so.
2654,Bree,"cram it, phyllis."
160,Bree,"oh,you want me to recommend the twins?"
1151,Bree,"you know, it's so unpleasant i'd rather not get into it. have you seen these gravestones? some are from the eighteen hundreds. just fascinating."
2104,Bree,mr. faladi--
1636,Bree,i'd prefer if you--didn't.
3601,Bree,"by ""adult,"" you mean complex and sophisticated?"
3600,Bree,"the man is going to marry my son. if there is something about him i should know, i want to hear it now, please."
4112,Bree,"as of this moment, rex, i am no longer your wife. i am going to go out, and find the most vindictive lawyer i can find, and together, we are going to eviscerate you. i'm going to take away your money, your family, and your dignity. do you hear me?"
2097,Bree,don't you dare leave this house!
4042,Bree,what is that?
670,Bree,"so, what are you having? the veal looks good."
1792,Bree,"isn't this wonderful?good food,pleasant conversation--this really is a very special night."
2145,Bree,"oh, danielle, i thought you'd be with mr. faladi tonight."
1142,Bree,where did you get this?
1413,Bree,"okay, first of all, i want you to march back upstairs and tell your friend he is no longer welcome in this house."
2632,Bree,then i'll give it back to you.
2673,Bree,but you can't raise this child in a miami dorm room. you'll need to leave it with someone you can trust to take care of it properly.
1960,Bree,"well, i thought we agreed we wanted our wedding night to be perfect."
1918,Bree,"things were falling apart at home, and i just--i just needed a place to rest, that's all."
1824,Bree,"honey, i can't possibly put it in the garbage as is."
2141,Bree,"mr. faladi, if you want to break my daughter's heart, i can't stop you, but i will not be an accomplice. you'll tell her yourself."
288,Bree,"no, and in the future i would appreciate you keeping your ridiculous ideas to yourself!"
1338,Bree,you know this gainful employment thing is really starting to cut into our social life.
3025,Bree,who could that be at this hour? susan. what on earth?
2562,Bree,"in your condition, that's what you should be doing. and where on earth did you get skates in a convent?"
170,Bree,"the point is i don't feel safe here, and i was wondering if you would spend the night."
688,Bree,"oh come on, don't be so dramatic. some of these places actually look fun. look. camp hennessey."" ""camp hennessey teaches kids respect for authority and boundaries in a summer camp-like atmosphere."
729,Bree,bring them in.
2511,Bree,"do not move. we want to pamper you, so please let us."
219,Bree,"i must say, i'm jealous of how much time you two spend together. my mother-in-law would never want to hang out with me all day."
898,Bree,"couldn't sleep, so i was just sitting here thinking."
4035,Bree,must you be so crude?
2720,Bree,how are you feeling?
2417,Bree,aah!
2616,Bree,"orson, just five more minutes! that's all you're getting! i tell you what. why don't we just skip the shower, and after the baby's born, i'll have a christening party? what do you say?"
2947,Bree,"well, i was at the service this morning, and it's just not the same without you."
2687,Bree,are you insane?
3551,Bree,"all right, but i think i'll be too tired to finish it. that pill i took really kicked in fast."
2151,Bree,"well, orson tells me that the two of you were very close, and out of respect for that friendship, i'm all ears."
3481,Bree,"no! i-i refuse to pay blackmail to some hooligan who's stolen from us twice! andrew--all my life, i have done my best to teach you to respect god and the law and never to harm another living thing. i want you to forget every one of those lessons if it'll help you get that tape back."
3303,Bree,we don't have to read them out loud.
2747,Bree,i'm only thinking of benjamin. be reasonable.
2102,Bree,"you know, we never discussed what it was like for you while you were-- away. i just want you to know, if you ever wanna talk about it, there's nothing you can't tell me."
543,Bree,"oh, i should not have done that. i am--"
2817,Bree,you're leaving fairview?
202,Bree,"oh,good, because last night you put me in such a holiday mood, so i'm going to make roast turkey and canned yams and egg nog. have you ever had real old-fashioned egg nog?"
2684,Bree,my son--trying on his costume. he's going to be cher this year.
1645,Bree,"well,it's just my way of saying thank you for everything you've done for me over the past few weeks.what's-- wrong?"
1309,Bree,"no, no, i'm just tired, that's all."
3355,Bree,"actually, stu's company is doing all my advertising."
3175,Bree,"look, i'm sorry. i didn't know a photo shoot would take this long. i mean, who knew it'd be this hard to pose for a book cover?"
1266,Bree,there you go. all done.
737,Bree,"well, i'm not your mommy and if you mess around in my house you will get spanked. now be good."
69,Bree,it's just-i miss you.
1270,Bree,weird?
479,Bree,"it'll, um, it'll be a lot easier once he gets well enough to move out."
2962,Bree,this is not my pie.
1668,Bree,"it's not a good time for change in my life,peter.terrible things are happening.i'm headed to court.i need your support now more than ever."
950,Bree,"hi. i would have been over sooner to introduce myself, but i'm afraid there's been a death in my family."
417,Bree,"and i am so thrilled to know that you still love me. because i want what's about to happen to you, to hurt as much is as humanly possible. i'm so glad you didn't die before i got a chance to tell you that."
622,Bree,"oh, sweetheart, just because you give a boy sex doesn't mean you'll get love in return."
583,Bree,try what? hurting you? you actually want me to hurt you?
3660,Bree,don't encourage him! orson is a horrible negotiator. he's never met a sticker price he didn't like.
2990,Bree,you really should have more faith in people. excuse me.
3724,Bree,"look, there's even a refrigerator. the lexus dealer said there's just enough room for a split of champagne and two chilled glasses. and the best thing is, it's a hybrid so you can barely hear it. let me show you."
3596,Bree,i am gonna handle everything for this wedding.
2236,Bree,"gloria, stop!"
3617,Bree,really? they say that?
2056,Bree,thank you.
262,Bree,"no, i don't. i sound like a woman whose husband won't touch her. rex, after mary alice killed herself, it all hit me. we all have our secrets, and i think it's time for you to tell me yours."
2896,Bree,"oh, so why don't you take this piece of pie upstairs to julie?"
3497,Bree,meaning susan is your oldest friend on this street.
3545,Bree,"you want honesty? fine. you didn't want to divorce mike. you hit a really bad patch after the accident, but you never stopped loving him. and why would you? your relationship didn't have a natural end. so face it. you're not mad at me or mike or katherine. you're mad at yourself for letting your marriage falls apart."
4049,Bree,"oh, really?"
2114,Bree,remind me to buy paper plates. we'll need them till a certain someone can be trusted with china again.
1216,Bree,"well,i'll just have to get over it,won't i?"
2133,Bree,of course not. i already went through thinking i'd lost andrew. i can't go through that again.
1340,Bree,"good, good. seeing friends. i just started co-chairing a charity event for the junior league and um, and i broke up with george."
2850,Bree,sylvia! open the damn door!
3151,Bree,ugh. what more can you do to me?
756,Bree,"one of us should go talk to him, see how he is."
512,Bree,you shouldn't listen to a woman who's just had her heart broken. we tend to lie.
410,Bree,"oh, i don't hate you, maisy. i pity you."
3876,Bree,"this isn't my problem, dr. bernstein. he's the sick one. fix him."
3657,Bree,"orson, take it easy!"
2062,Bree,"a reporter just did a story on homeless teens, my son is one of them."
3501,Bree,"all right, then, we'll see you soon."
3992,Bree,"oh, right. karl's a divorce lawyer."
229,Bree,"just one. how much longer is your midlife crisis going to last, because it is really starting to tick me off!"
2934,Bree,"oh! good morning, reverend. i brought your favorite-- blueberry scones."
3295,Bree,and you think that's my fault?
110,Bree,8 o'clock. sorry to interrupt. bye.
1586,Bree,"oh,okay.are you a friend of andrew's?"
2780,Bree,"oh, give it some time. we're still adjusting, and benjamin is sleeping so soundly."
1185,Bree,"well, great. um, how would you feel about the two of us checking into a romantic hotel tomorrow?"
1528,Bree,thank you.that's very sweet.so where have you been living this whole time? upstairs?
3655,Bree,"of course this will require an updated irrigation system, which i'm happy to take care of."
3466,Bree,"yeah, and the best part is we get to see each other all the time."
2956,Bree,"just-- wanted to tell you that i'm out of the running for the ladies' auxiliary. i told reverend sykes to, uh, give it to edna fletcher. she was in the peace corps, you know."
3815,Bree,isn't it noon?
922,Bree,"no, and i need to clean out our rain gutters, and, uh, beneath the refrigerator, and i can't tell you how long it's been since i've replaced the shelf liner, so--"
8,Bree,"susan? susan. i was just saying paul wants us to go over on friday. he needs us to go through mary alice's closet, and help pack up her things. he says he can't face doing it by himself."
3833,Bree,"now, now. he's been very good to me."
772,Bree,"i'll get the door. honey, you pour the wine."
1101,Bree,"george, i can't allow you to discipline my child if you won't even tell me what he did."
2762,Bree,"oh, we had a very busy day. we dropped off the dry cleaning, we deposited money into our christmas account, and then we got circumcised."
2230,Bree,okay! maybe i will share my secret ingredient.
25,Bree,what?
2778,Bree,all right. how was it?
1009,Bree,"i, i, i don't know how to bowl."
2655,Bree,"well, good. you can decide to pack, because we are taking you back to the convent."
35,Bree,"well, we could do it gently. we could tell him about it over coffee and pastry."
11,Bree,"first of all, your father can't eat onions, he's deadly allergic. and i won't even dignify your navy bean suggestion. so. how's the osso bucco?"
832,Bree,"mmmh! oh, george, you have got to taste this. it's a little messy but.."
3455,Bree,sit.
2650,Bree,"it's just a little, uh--"
859,Bree,sort of? don't you remember the glorious food and the gorgeous scenery?
291,Bree,"that's a smart idea, because you're probably going to have to sleep in it for a while."
2270,Bree,we saw that woman at the morgue--on our wedding night. you pretended not to know her.
1676,Bree,"no! no,i-i don't feel like i'm gonna drink.and if i did,i certainly would call donna.i mean,she and i are just--we're just really clicking."
854,Bree,what's the matter? you've been mopy all day.
2027,Bree,i'm fine. let's just go back to our guests and forget any of this ever happened.
1904,Bree,"why is my certainty a flaw? i know what i'm about,i know my values, and i know what's right.why shouldn't i stay the course? am i right, mr. williams?"
3693,Bree,"no, we don't."
2295,Bree,"they found monique's blood on the wrench that mike was trying to dispose of. i mean, that hardly screams innocence."
1478,Bree,"i just thought you should know that i came home to find your son hiding underneath my daughter's bed,and it just seems to me that--"
3149,Bree,"oh, dear god. oh, no. don't die on me now! aah! oh, dear god."
3739,Bree,"lynette, hi. oh, i wish i had time for a chat, but i'm on my way to a meeting. i might design my own line of bakeware. can you imagine?"
159,Bree,yes.
75,Bree,"well, good, because i have some new flatbread that i've just been dying to show off."
1966,Bree,"ahh, excuse me."
3884,Bree,that's not true!
460,Bree,"well, um--"
771,Bree,i'm making homemade bratwurst with sweet and sour cabbage. it's a recipe i found in an old german cook book.
668,Bree,"rex. if you walk out of this restaurant, i will scream."
1999,Bree,don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
49,Bree,"oh, i.."
3926,Bree,thank you for--checking in on him and for answering my question.
2906,Bree,susan!
2130,Bree,"danielle, how can you think i don't care about your feelings?"
3405,Bree,you work here?
2210,Bree,"orson, what's the big deal? it's just an address."
3668,Bree,"hi, mike."
1379,Bree,justin? is he a friend of yours from school or church? what kind of friend is he?
1640,Bree,"tonight was a very unusual situation.i wish you could've known me when--rex was alive and my kids were young,and everything was--the way it was supposed to be.i think you really would've liked me-- so much."
2285,Bree,actually--i could probably use the distraction.
2873,Bree,"oh, hi, susan. i hope you don't mind that i made dinner."
2950,Bree,lynette! you were the one who came to me. you sought me out.
3380,Bree,it's-- complicated.
1926,Bree,do you remember that girl melanie foster?matthew is the one who killed her.
739,Bree,those cookies were made from scratch. your fate is sealed. come here.
3122,Bree,i have no idea. now if you'll please excuse me.
215,Bree,"oh,well, okay. i'll see you tomorrow then."
517,Bree,"oh, george."
3947,Bree,shouldn't we say something first?
533,Bree,because you were unfaithful.
1783,Bree,"your brother and i had a talk,and we've come to a detente of sorts."
2647,Bree,"well, it was mary alice, but as you may have heard--"
1325,Bree,dr. goldfine has concerns about us being together and i'm starting to thinking he's right
4069,Bree,i want a divorce.
3761,Bree,"hey, you made me partner. i can change 15%, and i chose the parmesan. and i don't know if you've heard, but people are raving about my pizza."
1425,Bree,how'd it go?
167,Bree,did you hear there was a break in at mrs fome's the other night?
3252,Bree,it's after midnight. haven't you eaten?
1220,Bree,exactly. you're a mother trying to protect her child. it's a natural impulse.
1132,Bree,thank you. you don't know how much this means to me. i've realized looking back that i was still in shock during rex's first funeral. i don't think it had quite hit me yet what had happened so that's why this small ceremony means so much to me. because i realize now that this is the last chance i'm gonna have to say goodbye.
2278,Bree,we also have cable.
1650,Bree,oh.
3940,Bree,"if you'd like, we could give you a moment."
675,Bree,"yes, and, and to tell you the truth, i'm a little insulted. i am a good friend. why would you feel like you have to hide that from me?"
1514,Bree,who told you that?
425,Bree,"fine. i will see him through this, but after that, your father can rot in hell for all i care!"
2796,Bree,"mmm, yes, you do. i'm mrs. zimmerman."
2733,Bree,circumcision's not mutilation. it's a simple surgery meant to promote lifelong masculine hygiene.
3522,Bree,"spare me your ""darling,"" sandra. i know you've been trying to dig up dirt on me."
3867,Bree,"gaby! aren't you being a little harsh? i mean, perhaps she didn't take it."
4104,Bree,i wanted to protect what was mine. you have turned into someone i don't recognize.
3124,Bree,orson. orson.
571,Bree,good. i'm looking forward to it. are you looking forward to it?
2312,Bree,"oh, we've rented you a condo in a lovely retirement community. it's our christmas gift to you."
33,Bree,"oh my god, she got it the day she died."
3028,Bree,what?
695,Bree,"well, think about how good men are at lying on the spot. i mean, god forbid, you should give them time and a pen!"
2828,Bree,"well, i know katherine, and believe me, you're not the only person i've seen her reduce to tears."
2407,Bree,"orson, your ex-wife is a homicidal rapist, and your mother is straight out of ""i, claudius."" why do you refuse to deal with them?"
2349,Bree,please leave my house.
1448,Bree,"you know what?i politely rejected you,and now you're getting your revenge by embarrassing me."
391,Bree,yeah. people do terrible things when they think no one is watching them.
3708,Bree,"since i started writing my own cookbook. remember how you told me i should start making my own money? well, i've been going through all my old recipes, and i've got this great idea for a real home-style american cookbook."
2074,Bree,yard work?
2185,Bree,harvey cheated?
3123,Bree,"oh, dear lord."
83,Bree,"my backhand's improving immensely, but you're still having problems with your serve."
1754,Bree,because i can be very strong for those people that i really care about.
2518,Bree,i'm not. that despicable woman was just supposed to bring a simple green salad. she not only brought a pie--she hid mine and served hers.
2921,Bree,there. you have your answer. now sit.
3450,Bree,"and i'm not family? katherine, all my life, i wanted a sister. and now i feel like i finally have one."
810,Bree,"really? well, okay. you know what i'm going to miss most about him? george always has a way of making me feel good about myself."
1884,Bree,fine. then i'm going back to my room.
3553,Bree,since when have you become such an expert on chamomile?
2557,Bree,"ooh. here you go, but please don't mention my name. as i said, you know, he's overbooked, and i just don't want to get on his bad side."
310,Bree,we could have been better parents.
2957,Bree,i suppose. i just wanted to let you know that. and also to-- apologize.
849,Bree,"i am not having an affair! george and i-we just talk. he's a very good listener and i share my hopes and dreams with him and my innermost thoughts. and that's all there is to it, and you have to believe me."
38,Bree,good. i have a question for you.
3807,Bree,"well, take it back now. they're liquidating, and they're gonna need every penny they can get."
3165,Bree,then he raised the gun and came toward us. thank god katherine grabbed his arm and got the gun away. that lunatic would've killed us all.
1820,Bree,"yeah. i just wasn't tired.oh, i wanna show you what else i've planned.i think you're gonna love it."
1366,Bree,"''no,wait!is that supposed to be me?''"
1511,Bree,oh! what is it?
342,Bree,"a woman is in a coma, because of andrew. and there he is, happy as a clam!"
2412,Bree,"i don't care if you go to jail. you have done a horrible thing, and you have to make it right. i mean it, orson. if you don't fix this, i will."
2344,Bree,susan?
3430,Bree,"mmm. ohh. mwah. well, you deserve some credit, too. i mean, you brought us peter's business."
907,Bree,i don't believe you.
1357,Bree,i called them while you were asleep. they're already on their way.
3342,Bree,"do you? because i see children crawling into ovens, hoping to see dinosaurs."
1324,Bree,"please, you should go."
3388,Bree,"when orson left, i--began having a glass of white wine now and then. then when danielle took benjamin, i didn't see any reason to stop at just one."
3080,Bree,edie--please.
2660,Bree,"i'm just so mad at myself. i should have realized that the maternal instinct is so strong, that even danielle would develop it."
627,Bree,"hello, john. i'm sorry to drop by on you, unannounced. do you have a moment?"
1350,Bree,"hey. what were you thinking, taking the pills?"
2411,Bree,"and this, after he'd been in a coma because some lunatic ran him over."
258,Bree,"well, then, if that is the case, then take me, right here, right now. the house is spotless. there aren't any burritos lying around to pull my focus--"
1717,Bree,are you sure? i was talking to her in the steam room for about 20 minutes.
3775,Bree,"i knew. i just thought if they'd tasted mine, they might change the rules."
2568,Bree,it is?
1748,Bree,excuse me.excuse me.may i ask you something?
23,Bree,"if you think i'm gonna discuss the dissolution of my marriage in a place where the restrooms are labeled ""chicks"" and ""dudes "", you're out of your mind."
1977,Bree,sort of.
1845,Bree,yeah.
3480,Bree,"okay, this is not a joke. my book comes out next month--my old-fashioned, traditional cookbook! this could ruin me!"
3003,Bree,"here's the thing you need to understand about me and my friends. we each have our niche. gabrielle's the glamorous one. susan's the adorable one. lynette's smart. edie's--edie. and i'm the domestic one, the organizer--the one who knows that there are three tines on a dessert fork. i'm the one who gets teased for that. that's who i am. and that's also who you are."
1728,Bree,"well,now that you can't afford to become emancipated,i guess you're gonna have to stay here with me."
1975,Bree,"well, that's the odd thing.i mean there was no pain, per se, in fact, it wasn't entirely unpleasant."
2738,Bree,"oh, so you found the chocolate sauce?"
3769,Bree,"lynette, i-i-i don't understand why you're so upset."
3011,Bree,no. never.
3503,Bree,"that was all local. this is ""the new york dispatch."" if this goes well, my cookbook could be on the front page of their weekend style section. katherine, what did you do to your hair? i've never seen it look so thick and lustrous."
1079,Bree,"actually, it is getting late, and i am tired, so--"
3401,Bree,"orson, i should have never offered you that job. it wasn't fair to katherine."
2031,Bree,a reporter just did a story on homeless teens and my son was one of them.
3103,Bree,"maybe not. we call gabrielle ""gaby."" i mean, perhaps there's a shortened version of ""maynard"" you could live with."
3935,Bree,"my theory--edie knew if she was buried, her true date of birth would be carved into a tombstone for all the world to see."
307,Bree,"i had just been--thinking about the kids. they sure grew up quickly, didn't they?"
2753,Bree,"susan, addicts are experts at deception. my advice to you--trust--but verify."
1218,Bree,"oh, come on, that's a picture of your baby. you can't tell me you're not a little bit excited."
934,Bree,"but his operation, it's not until tomorrow."
96,Bree,if everybody would please take your seats. dinner is served.
1049,Bree,yes.
3045,Bree,"edie, would you do me a favor and take orson back to his apartment? i have to let my sitter go home."
3883,Bree,"so you decided to punish me by resorting to petty theft? for god sakes, orson, i'm your wife."
1181,Bree,"well, susan did say that he murdered mrs. huber, so my vote would be yes."
3521,Bree,thank you.
2505,Bree,"so what did julie say, exactly?"
368,Bree,"yes, i am."
418,Bree,are you having an affair with my husband?
2207,Bree,"oh, by the way, orson, i need your mother's address at the nursing home."
1282,Bree,we discussed this. we agreed to go slowly.
2446,Bree,"wow, somebody's--blonder."
2879,Bree,"yes, and a nice home-cooked meal. trust me, there are absolutely no tricks up our sleeve."
3146,Bree,"yes? oh, there you are! where is my ice sculpture? no! no,6:00 is too late. i need it now. oh, forget it. i'll pick it up myself."
1345,Bree,"george, i know what you did to dr. goldfine. and i can see now just how sick you really are, so please just turn yourself in and that way you can get the help that you really need. george!"
1663,Bree,i actually don't want anything of the sort.
458,Bree,"oh, uh, you remember mr. williams, our pharmacist?"
1952,Bree,"i know it's quick but it's just feel so right.orson is just the most warm, wonderful, generous man."
1798,Bree,did you forget that we're supposed to take that tour of perkins college today?
831,Bree,who says he has to know how i spend my free time?
542,Bree,that i don't know. what do you think i should do?
814,Bree,i think it would be a mistake for us to spend too much time together.
3836,Bree,i'll get your coat.
530,Bree,"you know what? at our next settlement talks, i plan on asking for your golf clubs!"
1403,Bree,"no, i wouldn't be so hard on yourself, given her history."
4002,Bree,"well, what kind of a favor?"
850,Bree,thank you. i'm glad we cleared this up. i know that it must have looked strange and i didn't want you to think that i was cheating on my husband.
1992,Bree,so what do you think?
1769,Bree,"get away from her!danielle,i want you to pick up the phone and call the police."
3314,Bree,"oh, my god! that is so amazing! the, uh, dry cleaner just, um--found my sweater."
1537,Bree,"aren't you gonna ask me what we talked about?the name, um--melanie foster came up.i'm gonna pour you a drink now, betty,because we're about to have a very honest discussion,and i think you're gonna need a little help getting through it."
3141,Bree,"oh, i get it. so i'm desperate and vulnerable, and you're gonna swoop in and save the day. well, thank you very much. i'm fine."
2691,Bree,"you know, danielle, i just want you to be aware that giving up this baby might be harder than you think."
902,Bree,"rex, everybody is talking about our sex life. every sordid little detail right down to that box of perversions you keep in your closet."
1371,Bree,"well, we'll never know."
1925,Bree,i'm calling the police.
2849,Bree,"no, no, no, she's barricaded herself in there."
2082,Bree,"i'm not telling who it is. i'm just asking the question. if you know a husband has been unfaithful, do you tell the wife?"
2343,Bree,can't this wait? we're having a dinner party.
1849,Bree,"oh, no, i'm fine.i'm just tired, that's all.i just need a long rest,and then i'm gonna be as good as new."
3721,Bree,"hello, ladies. what do you think?"
54,Bree,dr. goldfine. there is something you can do for me.
2070,Bree,what were you and andrew talking about today at the fair?
3426,Bree,he came while orson was out. i let him record a message on my phone.
1300,Bree,george.
2595,Bree,"yeah, everything's fine, but, uh, there was just a time where i thought i might lose it."
1212,Bree,can't you just be patient? can't you wait just a little bit longer?
4054,Bree,charming.
2861,Bree,"you know, maybe a moment of silence wouldn't be such a bad idea."
3801,Bree,you're paid based on your contribution.
3893,Bree,"andrew, do you know why my book sold so well? because it was authentic. i actually believe in the old-fashioned values i wrote about. i believe in men opening doors for ladies and children respecting their elders. i also believe that sometimes women need to make sacrifices for their husbands. i would be the worst kind of hypocrite if i preached these values and then didn't follow them myself."
3182,Bree,"katherine! fantastic news. ""what's cookin' fairview?"" is sending out a camera crew tomorrow to do a piece on me and the book."
3520,Bree,"oh, dear god. this woman is determined to make my life sound ten times worse than it actually is."
3286,Bree,"isn't this nice? for the first time in years, my family is all here under the same roof."
3196,Bree,the secret to spinning sugar is this special whisk that makes lovely gossamer threads.
2546,Bree,point well taken. i'll bring the wine.
1544,Bree,"well,okay.tony?how many more arias is he gonna sing?"
2969,Bree,good morning. what's going on?
394,Bree,"uh, the situation is, um, fluid. i'm not certain what his plans are yet."
1775,Bree,we ask god to grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change--
3387,Bree,i'm too tired. can you do it?
2671,Bree,"well, we were gonna surprise you with one for your birthday, but since you're keeping the baby, you'll want a more practical gift."
148,Bree,i suppose i do owe you an apology.
3333,Bree,i don't think we need to do that.
742,Bree,"oh, i had to spank him. alright i will re-raise."
3033,Bree,"i know, but i'm the one thing you can't have."
538,Bree,"i'm not. the coffee is just dreadful. well, it's late, and i needed to get out of the house, and it was the only place still open."
4005,Bree,"i need your help, karl. i really do, but i am not comfortable manipulating a 6-year-old."
1592,Bree,emancipated?
606,Bree,"well, you know what? if he is innocent, this should be a simple matter to clear up."
3290,Bree,that is not meat.
2772,Bree,partly. what's your point?
2619,Bree,nope.
21,Bree,um. think i'll go get your salad for you.
303,Bree,we can only hope.
2272,Bree,"there were two women in your life before me. one vanished, and the other was killed. that's all i need to understand. i've packed some of your things. i want you out of the house. now."
3319,Bree,where are you?
2171,Bree,what is all this?
959,Bree,the happiest time in rex's life was not his childhood. he loved being a husband and he loved being a father.
2195,Bree,"uh, yes, um--i just-- ran into her this morning."
3870,Bree,what were you doing at bob and lee's?
1981,Bree,"oh.well, i'll be darn."
2296,Bree,"we all have convictions, susan. i believe mike's last one was for manslaughter."
647,Bree,"yes, yes, they were. i fold."
3354,Bree,"um ,this is"
2996,Bree,"""i was honored when you--"" myeah, myeah, myeah, myeah."
3044,Bree,"no, it's a pathetic fantasy fueled by cowardice and amaretto sours. you committed a crime, orson. face it."
211,Bree,take off those handcuffs please.
2814,Bree,okay. now i--i really am gonna cry.
1251,Bree,but you should know that. that's the kind of thing that people who are engaged are supposed to know about each other.
2688,Bree,"you are due in three weeks. until then, no windows and no parties."
3723,Bree,so how do you like my new car?
1406,Bree,"i thought everybody knew.oh, i feel awful.oh, ida greenberg's behind you."
3078,Bree,"edie, if word got out, my whole family would be--humiliated."
132,Bree,i am perfectly capable of handling this without your father.
1732,Bree,yes?
2490,Bree,"no,it's nothing!"
1343,Bree,how can you not believe in evil? a man just threw you off a bridge for no reason.
4041,Bree,"well, i wonder if the victims of your kleptomania felt the same way."
1369,Bree,"don't you worry about me, detective barton. i will be just fine."
1718,Bree,"yeah,apparently you gave her a gift certificate."
2044,Bree,"excuse me, ma'am? i mean-- miss. i'm looking for someone. uh, his name is andrew. have you seen him?"
1570,Bree,i will not be spoken to like that.i just won't.
2794,Bree,bye.
717,Bree,you don't have a choice.
3305,Bree,"yeah. oh, i almost forgot."
9,Bree,are you ok?
1980,Bree,yes.
3931,Bree,you're right. i shouldn't have asked. i know it's horrible here.
1943,Bree,"no, no, um, i do.it just that i, um, can't help being cautious, since rex i haven't been exactly lucky in love."
218,Bree,it just doesn't make any sense. zach is such a sweet kid. i can't imagine him doing anything that terrible.
3726,Bree,"oh, dear. is something wrong?"
129,Bree,you know it's leaking.
718,Bree,"rex, i'm not going and that's all there is to it."
1912,Bree,"and why should they? so, um, alfred, i was wondering if you could maybe loosen my restraints. they're incredibly tight, and i'm sure there are no rules against making me more comfortable."
3981,Bree,orson's lying to me again.
3929,Bree,i do.
2293,Bree,"what?! no, i did not, and i don't plan to."
3675,Bree,"well, it's just that grilling is such a manly pastime. if i suggested that orson somehow failed to produce the perfect steak, you might see it as another example emasculation."
1618,Bree,"well,you know,before mike came along,i always just assumed they'd get back together."
1803,Bree,i noticed a bus stop about a mile back.you can go anywhere you want.
1715,Bree,"i just got a massage at misty spring.things have been a little tense at home, and i needed an hour to relax."
243,Bree,the man at the desk said there were no vacant rooms. mind if i bunk with you?
1353,Bree,and then we'll call an ambulance and they'll pump your stomach.
2679,Bree,i'll say that you're broke and needed the money.
456,Bree,"me, too."
2302,Bree,orson?
1189,Bree,i can't stay in a hotel room with you.
4022,Bree,"well, i just never know with you. and don't call me ""freckles."""
3019,Bree,"i sympathize. i do, but i have a new baby, and it's really more work than i care to take on right now."
2046,Bree,"oh, thank you, miss--"
3712,Bree,"thanks, eli."
3346,Bree,"well, you're--entitled to think so, but i don't."
414,Bree,i have. i was so afraid you were gonna die. there were so many things i haven't had a chance to tell you.
2364,Bree,"how can i be calm?! for months, people thought you killed your first wife. no sooner does she show up and clear your name, than the police haul you off to ask you about another murder!"
1469,Bree,"i'm sorry,but since when do you know so much about my personal life?"
3399,Bree,fine. you're fired.
3937,Bree,i don't know. can you ever be ready to tell a boy that his mother is dead?
1513,Bree,can we talk about this later?i-i have ice cream in here.
1155,Bree,"i have done nothing to be forgiven for! i was a fantastic wife! when he was sick, i nursed him. when we were low on money, i stayed within a budget. i cooked his meals, i mended his clothes. for the love of god, i used to check his back for acne. and that miserable son of a bitch has the nerve to understand and forgive me! well, the joke's on him because i do not understand and i do not forgive!"
2011,Bree,"excuse me, could you give us just a second?"
34,Bree,"it's a letter, addressed to mary alice."
1949,Bree,i'm not being coy.
1751,Bree,"well, i have been doing some thinking and--here's a thought--why don't i be your sponsor?"
1383,Bree,"well, the good news is he's, he's dead."
598,Bree,no.
3857,Bree,"you will do no such thing. from this moment on, you are forbidden from entering any of our friends' homes."
4103,Bree,"my beef is that from the minute i walked into this office, you have pulled me deeper and deeper into your moral cesspool. that is not why i hired you."
1509,Bree,what on earth?
1293,Bree,can i help you?
882,Bree,"well, i guess it wouldn't hurt to sit her down and share our concerns."
2866,Bree,"walter, i can't find a contractor now. everybody is booked for the next year."
2043,Bree,we'll talk in the car.
1037,Bree,"my husband died of a heart attack. i loved him very deeply, and your mother did a lousy job."
406,Bree,then why is he so unhappy?
2504,Bree,it's my pride and joy.
1721,Bree,"oh,dad,i-i forgot to warn you.these are some of andrew's adult videos.i don't approve,but boys will be boys."
176,Bree,"oh, hi,zachery. i'm sorry. the door was open and-"
3088,Bree,"i reject your peace, and i demand you stop stalking me."
2795,Bree,"hello, doctor."
2625,Bree,"well, i'm, uh, sorry if that offends you, phyllis, but i didn't want orson to feel uncomfortable in his new home."
2449,Bree,this might not be as easy as we'd hoped.
1070,Bree,no.
2496,Bree,we're already in too deep.
1938,Bree,do i know you?
308,Bree,i remember telling them when they were babies that they weren't allowed to get any bigger because they were so adorable. and we were so happy.
1501,Bree,what are you talking about?
1927,Bree,his mother told me what happened. it's true.
2745,Bree,that you even felt such a thing was necessary.
1015,Bree,this is rex's mother phyllis.
3648,Bree,"it was going to be a surprise, you know, for your wedding. unfortunately, this whole silly oakdale thing has forced me to show my hand."
663,Bree,"well, i could be wrong, but i suspect that maisy gibbons' client list has been released."
2635,Bree,"yes, and for the sake of her reputation, we've agreed to pretend that it's mine."
1219,Bree,"well, i think mike will calm down in a couple of days and come to his senses."
2045,Bree,"yes, very, and i'm worried sick about him."
949,Bree,"mrs. applewhite, hi. i am bree van de kamp, and this is my daughter danielle."
1089,Bree,"honey, the feelings that you're having are perfectly normal, but george isn't trying to take your father's place. he's, well, he's just a friend."
4016,Bree,why not?
3409,Bree,"oh. well, it looks like we're all set until the morning then. hey, why don't you, uh, take the afternoon off?"
3957,Bree,he sounded very sincere.
3794,Bree,"okay, fine. if i had to pick a favorite, i guess it would be munchy. she was a bit rambunctious. father sent her to a farm so she'd have room to run. i cried for weeks and weeks."
2075,Bree,"orson, you're scaring me. did he do something awful?"
3359,Bree,coupons?
624,Bree,yes. well -
910,Bree,"um, all right. you, uh, go downstairs and i will be, i'll be right there."
2052,Bree,how did you find out that?
2283,Bree,and yet you're cooking?
1331,Bree,it was not a tiff! we broke up! it's over!
1940,Bree,oh.
4114,Bree,"you know what i really truly want? revenge. i mean, if somehow we could level the playing field, then, um, maybe i could find a way to come back."
1003,Bree,phyllis? you're going to have to stop that.
3385,Bree,"andrew, really."
2760,Bree,"well, he's out of town, and--our benjamin is 8 days old today. and if i don't do this, my grandma--tzeitel--will never forgive me, may she rest in peace."
1229,Bree,"see, i thought we were going to a yard sale."
562,Bree,i think it has something to do with why he had the affair.
2563,Bree,"danielle, what if your reckless behavior had hurt the baby?"
573,Bree,"i'm sorry, rex. i thought i could pretend that this doesn't upset me anymore, but i can't."
1727,Bree,"well,actually they can.i mean,it's their money to dispense with as they see fit.i know it doesn't seem fair,but--"
3766,Bree,"well, not completely, but let's face it. you do cut corners. i mean, one of the things i can teach you is the importance of the attention to detail."
2939,Bree,which is just down the street. i'll be right back.
952,Bree,"thank you. that's just a huge weight off my shoulders. oh, these are for you."
1545,Bree,"oh. in that case,why don't you bring me another bottle of the pinot grigio?and please hurry."
3813,Bree,"now that you brought it up, lynette, i've been feeling just awful about the way i took over your restaurant and insulted you and--what can i say?"
1100,Bree,well. what did he say?
355,Bree,"andrew, can i come in?"
1623,Bree,"oh,no,thank you.i have to run. just the check.i have a charity event this weekend,and i have to find a cocktail dress before the store closes.but everything was just yummy."
1096,Bree,andrew is being polite and engaging. he's even laughing at george's jokes.
1737,Bree,"yeah, apparently,he was seeing someone."
2735,Bree,"oh, that's ridiculous."
2323,Bree,why don't i wrap up a piece of this pound cake for you to enjoy later?
2847,Bree,"well, katherine, for what it's worth--i would've spit in her face, too."
646,Bree,"uh, what just happened?"
73,Bree,lynette!
3235,Bree,should i be proud? do you want me to go on the radio and boast that my husband served time for running someone over?
925,Bree,"because it makes me think of my aunt fern. on the day we got married, i told her how happy i was, and she told me that even during bad times to always remember that the best was yet to come. and so as i polish it, i think about you and the kids and our life and how right she was."
1386,Bree,nothing. i just sat there and let him die.
2764,Bree,orson.
1256,Bree,do you really want to know my secret?
2282,Bree,it's not that easy. i love him.
3542,Bree,"oh, god, susan. can't this wait till after my nap?"
2348,Bree,"boy, when it comes to mike there's no one you won't betray."
2147,Bree,"i don't plan to. well, i hope this doesn't make history class too awkward."
1621,Bree,"well,i'm still appalled that you're helping my son with this ridiculous emancipation scheme,but you are a guest in my house,and guests get sandwiches."
2017,Bree,"orson, you look so serious."
1117,Bree,i love it. thank you.
785,Bree,"andrew, come here, i want you to see this."
93,Bree,"oh. that's too bad. well, i should go."
3247,Bree,you can fix this. just tell them that you're at the wrong table and then slip out the side door.
1076,Bree,"ah, wel,l it's getting late, so-"
85,Bree,"oh, well i don't have any personal issues. my only issue is that my husband wants to leave me, and how can i work on that if he's not in the room?"
4068,Bree,"orson, i'm home."
2926,Bree,"lynette, i-i realize you don't have much experience with churches, so this really isn't your fault."
2429,Bree,i can't tell you right now. you're just gonna have to trust me. can you do that?
2526,Bree,"no, it's true. the only thing about me that's special is what i can do in the kitchen. you're right. i have got to get that recipe--by any means necessary."
723,Bree,no.
260,Bree,"rex, whatever you want, i'll go there with you. i will go there with you, you just have to say it out loud. tell me, what do you want? what do you need?"
3216,Bree,"well, um, michelle downing asked me to speak to you. i don't know if you heard, but i'm catering her birthday party"
1468,Bree,"you know,you sound like you don't believe me."
2318,Bree,so you deliberately framed orson?
1302,Bree,"well, she did, and she said some pretty horrible things about you."
1113,Bree,"george, what are you doing here?"
1994,Bree,i mean i was lucky to find these. it's not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
3934,Bree,i never told you about that because--i was embarrassed.
381,Bree,"you are unhappy with our sex life.you're not getting something from me,but you're simply too afraid to ask."
2961,Bree,"well, if you ever wanna try us again--"
173,Bree,that is for the kids' trip.
3243,Bree,gaby!
3835,Bree,but what about the job?
3762,Bree,"fine. i'll reimburse you, if that'll make things right."
1141,Bree,how would you know that?
3177,Bree,"well, you make this all possible."
390,Bree,"you know, if you really have that many doubts, you should go buy a hidden camera."
3688,Bree,"yes, i did."
1326,Bree,"george, i don't want to!"
3734,Bree,"come on, lynette. you can't tell me this money won't take the pressure off."
1304,Bree,no.
472,Bree,"yes, i'm angry with him. i am going to divorce him. i may even marry someone else, but make no mistake about it, your father is, and always will be, the love of my life. he gave me the best eighteen-year marriage that i could have ever hoped for. for that, you will respect him."
1045,Bree,i would like to submit myself to a lie detector test to eliminate any uncertainty about what happened with my husband.
612,Bree,"oh, uh, andrew, i'm gonna want you home by eleven on saturday."
711,Bree,"sorry, honey, but you don't have a choice."
3074,Bree,what on earth could you possibly want?
2871,Bree,"well, then you just have to fix him up with someone, give him back his will to work."
2517,Bree,"well, i would be more than happy to go with you."
2918,Bree,what are you doing?
341,Bree,it's just not right.
3012,Bree,"oh, sure, you can. whenever i feel my emotions getting the best of me, i simply picture an empty box, and i take whatever i'm feeling and put that in the box, and then i picture myself putting the box away in a big, empty closet and closing the door. then if i have time, i go back and open the box and deal with the emotion--in private, like a lady."
3421,Bree,"what a thoughtful son you are. so, uh, have you given any thought to the venue?"
3653,Bree,yeah! let's do that.
708,Bree,it just isn't you. and we feel that you need to spend some quality time thinking about the goals in your life and what kind of person you want to be.
2409,Bree,"yeah, but you weren't just trying to protect me, were you?"
2717,Bree,i am going back to get adam.
880,Bree,"yeah, good point."
3038,Bree,"exactly, and if you could muster that kind of moral courage, i think i could forgive you. oh, come on. i promise i'll wait for you."
2356,Bree,"no! i mean--i mean, no, alma, you can't buy this house."
750,Bree,"that is what makes a good mother. someone who knows their child inside and out, so that if they get into trouble they'll know what to do. i don't know him well enough."
3607,Bree,why would he--
1871,Bree,"oh, i just thought it would be a lovely place to take a nice, long rest."
2644,Bree,"phyllis, wait!"
3816,Bree,"maybe i can help. my publisher is thinking about doing his advertising in-house, and he's been looking for someone."
3765,Bree,"well, i've always believed that we create our own luck."
584,Bree,fine.
3781,Bree,"oh, thank god."
2630,Bree,"oh, for god sakes, phyllis, it's not as if we got along when rex was alive."
2725,Bree,"okay, baby. it's okay, little one. here we are. here we go. yes, here we go."
1864,Bree,"well, now that we've finished with all this unpleasantness, i want to assure you that we are going to be good neighbors, and i hope in time, great friends."
1026,Bree,"an autopsy? detective, rex died of a heart attack."
747,Bree,i wanted to wear andrew's favourite colour. then i realised that i don't know what it is.
532,Bree,"sweetie, i think it's too late."
1169,Bree,what is it?
3920,Bree,really? because i would consider that a perk worth paying for.
3229,Bree,"katherine, it is not too late to change tonight's menu. if linda flanagan likes my food, she might give me a quote for the book jacket. i have to knock her socks off, and i am not betting the farm on haddock. argue with me all you like. i just bought 40 pounds of pork, so get your tushie over here."
2438,Bree,"hello, ladies."
1264,Bree,"oh, come on. you don't think you're gonna love your own baby?"
3514,Bree,"andrew, please. the machine can get it. we never answer the phone while entertaining. so rude to one's guests."
3194,Bree,"oh, you poor dear. could someone please get some ice? oh, no."
3234,Bree,"orson, i have 6 hours to prepare a meal for 80 people. we're not having this discussion now."
655,Bree,"maisy, please. i mean, we used to be good friends."
1856,Bree,i'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation.i'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
4004,Bree,how would i go about doing that?
887,Bree,i could walk across a street tomorrow and be hit by a car.
3176,Bree,"okay, katherine. i know this book has been monopolizing my time, and you feel overworked and undervalued. but i do appreciate you. in fact, i have a gift for you. it's the galleys of my new book. read page 2."
3860,Bree,"yes, that would be lovely."
1426,Bree,"yeah, it seems obvious."
3502,Bree,the reporter's almost here. i am so nervous.
1789,Bree,"honey,what are you wearing?"
2320,Bree,so why have you come back?
1354,Bree,"i want to help you, but in order to do that, i need to forgive you, and, i can't do that until you admit what you've done."
1516,Bree,don't brush your hair at the table.
2695,Bree,"lynette, i was just thinking about you. did you get your test results yet?"
2532,Bree,that recipe is not from a book. that recipe was handed down to me from my mother.
67,Bree,"oh rex, you look so tired."
1200,Bree,i was saying i think we should go horseback riding.
3630,Bree,i don't know if i have it in me. she's such a troglodyte.
2674,Bree,tell your stepfather i'll be right out.
3587,Bree,"well, i just want you to know, if you need to scootch, alex, i am okay with scootching and--the rest of it."
2848,Bree,we can't. there's a woman in there.
3005,Bree,who knew you were so insightful?
607,Bree,so should i just dial nine one one?
396,Bree,yeah. but i['d still buy that camera.
777,Bree,"reverend, i don't mean to criticise. but it sounds like you're giving up."
2260,Bree,"i know she's a handful, but she deserves some compassion. the woman watched a dream die yesterday. i'm taking her dinner up."
1115,Bree,oh.
683,Bree,you know we are just lucky that that security guard did not press charges.
1959,Bree,does that change our core values?
436,Bree,so i hear.
1234,Bree,"well, obviously there's a downside to having good manners."
3513,Bree,"of course they can. if they read my book, that is. okay, truth be told--i'm far from perfect. only yesterday, i burned a whole tray of biscotti."
109,Bree,"dr. goldfine, please?"
3292,Bree,"all right, i'll concede the second one was clearly a mistake."
909,Bree,"no, you're not."
2317,Bree,"well, you should've told someone. people thought you were dead. some even thought that orson killed you."
2878,Bree,puff pastry?
3976,Bree,oh. and then you bumped it on that nasty curb.
2545,Bree,"well, none that i recall."
116,Bree,he got a last minute call to speak at a medical conference in philadelphia. take your seats.
3470,Bree,"oh, much better."
2636,Bree,"she's not in switzerland. she's at the sisters of hope convent. look, phyllis, i'm sorry. i know this is upsetting."
2234,Bree,"well, i didn't mean it literally, but okay. we'll, um, we'll sit together. and we'll talk."
2131,Bree,"when i saw you in that tub, it was the worst moment of my life.the thought of losing you is more than i can bear."
680,Bree,"gabby, this is the way i see it -- good friends offer to help in a crisis. great friends don't take no for an answer."
546,Bree,yes.
1883,Bree,"you know, i really don't have time for this nonsense.are you going to give me some serious drugs or not?"
246,Bree,"thanks. i was hoping you'd notice."" ""well, it certainly isn't the ritz, but it has all the essentials."
1730,Bree,i think you'd love the opera.the music and the voices--it's just all so-- passionate.
568,Bree,valentine's day is tomorrow.
3249,Bree,"okay, you can fix this. just explain you're going to a different party here at the club and that you got confused. mrs. downing never has to know."
2014,Bree,did you kill your wife? susan talked to that carolyn woman. why didn't you tell me that the police searched your house?
2527,Bree,i hope this isn't a bad time. i just wanted to bring you a housewarming gift. it's the recipe for my special mincemeat pie. it wouldn't be thanksgiving at my house without it.
3863,Bree,"i don't know, but it's awfully cute."
1258,Bree,"gaby, if i make it any tighter, you won't be able to sit down."
1144,Bree,"i'm sorry, but i, i have to go. i have some things that i need to take care of."
1550,Bree,boys--can you just keep it down just a little bit?because i have a very--special type of grown-up headache.
4024,Bree,what? no!
3914,Bree,that would be lovely. oh. you were being sarcastic.
2913,Bree,"exactly, and all the while, where was edna? lounging around in zimbabwe in the peace corps. she won't let any of us forget it."
1048,Bree,yes.
388,Bree,"why, are you feeling ashamed?"
100,Bree,"i'm packing your swimsuit. there's a pool there, and i know how swimming relaxes you."
441,Bree,can we talk about something else - something less depressing?
783,Bree,your father is into s&m.
1842,Bree,barbie!
473,Bree,"george, hi, it's me, bree. i was wondering, are you free next saturday?"
3233,Bree,"and waste valuable airtime? the show was about my cookbook, not about my tortured marital history."
1950,Bree,"oh, all right.i wanted to wait and make a proper announcement, but--"
462,Bree,"andrew, your father and i are separated and you know it."
3164,Bree,we don't have much time before the police get here. we need to talk.
2273,Bree,i know--but it scares the hell out of me.
4129,Bree,"oh, my--"
114,Bree,"that being said, i do love what he've done with that lawn."
539,Bree,"george, would you like to join me for a dreadful cup of coffee?"
2523,Bree,"orson, what am i gonna do?"
617,Bree,"well, good. but why on earth would you need a condom?"
2175,Bree,"hey, is that the new neighbor?"
2658,Bree,"you don't even know what that means, you petulant sock puppet!"
2025,Bree,he's kind and decent and nothing you could say will ever make me doubt him again. now please go.
2080,Bree,please don't cut into that pie. i made it for mike.
2776,Bree,don't.
314,Bree,but i'll never forgive them for growing up so quickly.
826,Bree,"rex, have you lost your mind?"
2339,Bree,"oh, about that apology--any time you're ready."
1479,Bree,"oh, honey."
2711,Bree,"danielle! we agreed to save that till the end of the night. the best part of the costume, and she pops the water balloon when people aren't even looking. orson! andrew!"
3274,Bree,"well, what happens next year when he overtakes you?"
1171,Bree,"oh, i don't think so. i've made duck, l ate a thousand times."
4083,Bree,what?!
297,Bree,"oh, andrew, i need your help, honey."
3263,Bree,"""danielle""? did he just call you ""danielle""?"
1595,Bree,"uh,mr. bormanis,i'll need a little time to think about this."
3320,Bree,"yes, you will."
3713,Bree,you were there?
426,Bree,"oh, i don't need your gratitude. you're only here because your children are master extortionists."
3330,Bree,"well, that's certainly an intriguing notion. but wouldn't it be awkward having me as your boss?"
3841,Bree,what do you call this?
1242,Bree,hello.
1580,Bree,"andrew,we're not touching your trust fund."
2457,Bree,off the hook? that doesn't even make sense.
2594,Bree,"okay. um--i haven't told anybody this, but--it's, uh, about the baby. there have been some complications."
1271,Bree,"you know, honey, people change."
3172,Bree,"andrew, dear, i'm going to take a little break. would you please tell this gentleman that if he calls me ""sweetie"" one more time, i'm gonna grab his camera and take picture of his colon."
3150,Bree,aah! help me! help!
1708,Bree,i'm so sorry. i know that you're good friends.
3008,Bree,"susan, i'm just going across the street. there's no need to act like a silent movie heroine."
3892,Bree,it was my idea. my work has been compromising my marriage. i didn't realize the toll it's been taking on orson.
3579,Bree,well--
936,Bree,you are gonna come through this operation just fine.
1158,Bree,my husband died thinking that i murdered him.
3574,Bree,he helped you through a very difficult time. the least we can do is let him know how much we appreciate--what the hell is this?
1811,Bree,"you know what? maybe andrew leaving will be good for us.you are all i have left,and i am gonna be the best mother that i can be."
3669,Bree,where's katherine?
3341,Bree,let mrs. van de kamp turn your oven into a time machine.
2300,Bree,"well, that was incredibly awkward. i'm sorry you both had to sit through it. was it me? was i out of line?"
3629,Bree,"well, at least gloria had the good taste to have a paralyzing stroke so we don't have to deal with her."
3650,Bree,"oh, and i love you, too. orson, dear, would you pour melina another glass of wine?"
2301,Bree,you're right--
1404,Bree,"you know, the affair."
3694,Bree,"and then there's church, of course."
184,Bree,i adore the holidays. i never get depressed if there's a beautifully decorated tree to look at.
1914,Bree,"well, there's nothing like being tied to a bed to change a girl's mind."
475,Bree,"george, would you go out to dinner with me?"
349,Bree,how many nannies did you interview?
2166,Bree,that would be lovely. thanks.
1104,Bree,"well, i think given everything that's happened, um, it's perfectly justified that you'd be frightened of zach."
1563,Bree,"well,you know how boys are at the age.they're escape artists."
4010,Bree,"oh, no. deep down, he's just a fragile little boy who wants to be liked."
39,Bree,do you remember when you proposed?
2354,Bree,"oh. well, um--i don't want to keep you. i'm sure that edie has lots of other houses to show you."
1020,Bree,"oh, my god. what happened?"
935,Bree,"yes, of course you did. thank you very much for calling."
2579,Bree,two mules for sister sara!
3735,Bree,okay.
820,Bree,yes. and bring ginger.
3511,Bree,why would i pay someone to do work that gives me such joy? now who wants a little snack?
1800,Bree,"there's so many things i wanna say to you,andrew.but mostly,i just want you to know how sorry i am."
3086,Bree,did you hear something?
3030,Bree,i think it's admirable that you wanna forgive orson--because i can't.
1287,Bree,the ring?
1128,Bree,"well, i have some good news. the police are finally releasing rex's body."
2451,Bree,"so we're in zurich, and i was sick after breakfast for the third morning in a row. and i thought to myself, dear god, i hope i have not developed an allergy to chocolate brioche. life just wouldn't be worth living."
2899,Bree,you. sit.
4115,Bree,"so, how does this domination thing work?"
244,Bree,"it's a little chilly out here, do you mind if we discuss this inside?"
3900,Bree,tell your wife i will be doing that second book after all.
2314,Bree,i just can't believe that orson could do such a thing.
357,Bree,oh. what was it about?
3722,Bree,"my book just made the ""times'"" best seller list. now they're talking 3-book deal, so i got the urge to splurge. and look what just blew on my windshield at the stop sign! life is good."
2649,Bree,"hi. uh, we were just talking about your sculpture."
1259,Bree,do you actually think they're gonna make fun of you?
305,Bree,"this is the most impoverished neighborhood in the city. trust me, somebody will steal the car."
846,Bree,i beg your pardon?
2392,Bree,"orson, i have caught you cheating. at least have the courtesy to wake up! oh, for god sakes. orson! orson? what have you done to him?!"
2391,Bree,"not as sorry as you are gonna be! orson, get up!"
1582,Bree,"because,sweetheart,it is my job to teach you about responsibility,setting goals,delayed gratification."
1285,Bree,"well, fortunately, people only read the announcements when there's nothing in the front page, and the headline today was about some catastrophic flood in sri lanka."
930,Bree,"and for the record, you are gonna come through this operation just fine."
1948,Bree,"well, um, i wanted to invite you to a dinner that orson and i are having this saturday."
2119,Bree,how can you sit there playing that ridiculous game?!your sister tried to kill herself.that doesn't upset you?
1519,Bree,"what did this caleb do,exactly?and why on earth are they hiding him?"
2813,Bree,you forgive me?
2935,Bree,"oh, is that happening now? i'd forgotten all about it."
2530,Bree,which is what? vanilla? nutmeg? cardamom?
285,Bree,did you offer to help danielle get into modeling school?
864,Bree,"come on, i'm allowed to psych you out."
2328,Bree,would you join orson and me for dinner tomorrow night?
3469,Bree,no. get me an oven mitt.
1418,Bree,you would actually let the police arrest your own mother?
2898,Bree,"walter, wait!"
3096,Bree,"although i always, uh, like a trip to the range, is there any particular reason we came here for party planning?"
1568,Bree,"now that you're speaking to me in a fairly accusatory tone,may i remind you that i was doing you a favor?"
3035,Bree,there is one thing.
1148,Bree,to rex's grave site.
3856,Bree,"well, maybe you'd feel more comfortable talking to a professional."
889,Bree,george. hi. what are you doing here?
1771,Bree,i don't care.
540,Bree,"it was my first week in college, and i went to a meeting of the young republicans where rex gave a speech, and i went up to him afterward and introduced myself, and i told him that i agreed with his stance on the death penalty. he took me out to a diner, and we, uh, stayed up till two in the morning talking about big government, gun control and illegal immigration. ah. it was just--it was just such a magical night, and i knew, by the time he got me back to my dorm, that one day i was going to be mrs. rex van de kamp."
1872,Bree,"um, listen, i told my friends that i was, um, i was at a spa, so if you run into susan,i--"
2515,Bree,"well, did we or did we not agree that i would bring the dessert?"
3744,Bree,"oh, you can just put that on a hanger in the back. what i want is to make this an opportunity for you. we can turn one of your dismal thursday night seatings into a real event."
3472,Bree,that does it. we're pressing charges.
3463,Bree,"well done, orson!"
1483,Bree,danielle--
1569,Bree,"no!the only problem i have is with your children.they're incorrigible because you let them run amok.and if i hadn't drifted off,they would have waited until i was in the bathroom or stuck on the phone or upstairs doing laundry."
223,Bree,"thank you, i feel really good about it."
3105,Bree,"i did, but, um, i'm afraid it hasn't worked out. it's been rough."
2425,Bree,susan.
36,Bree,"well if it was a joke, it was in very poor taste."
3332,Bree,just give me a sec.
2893,Bree,oh. you're going to eat that--here?
1659,Bree,do you have any idea what you might say?
1140,Bree,what?
2821,Bree,an educated guess.
3094,Bree,wonderful! with a little goat cheese.
2802,Bree,i'm sorry. i don't--i don't understand. why are you doing this?
431,Bree,"do me a favor, rex. please don't mistake my anal retentiveness for actual affection."
3868,Bree,"juanita! whenever my children stole, i sent them to bed without any supper. just a thought."
1452,Bree,"detective,i am not drunk,and i am not stupid.i know exactly what this is all about."
2981,Bree,katherine--
416,Bree,i know you still love me. maisy told me.
1394,Bree,"yeah, but to be fair to lynette, you are an ex-model.and surely it must have dawned on you that some women might prefer it if you didn't kiss their husbands."
804,Bree,please don't be this way. he's the only friend i have who is interested in cultural things.
1805,Bree,you win?
960,Bree,"phyllis, is there something you'd like to say?"
714,Bree,for being here. for standing by me through this.
2382,Bree,"well, we have to do something."
1738,Bree,"no, he did not say."
3231,Bree,isn't it amazing?
4099,Bree,what were you thinking?
1672,Bree,"um,donna--i-i really appreciate everything that you've been doing for me,but i think i was really making some progress with peter as my sponsor.and i was thinking--"
1749,Bree,"if a citizen,an ordinary citizen like myself,knew of someone holding a significant amount of drugs,what would my responsibilities be,you know, under the law?"
1839,Bree,you look like a girl who enjoys her frosting.
3938,Bree,we brought you some muffins. you can share them with your roommates or maybe a favorite teacher.
782,Bree,i'm upset because there is a problem here and no one seems to notice it but me.
1666,Bree,"i,um,i don't want a new sponsor.i'm-- i'm very comfortable working with you."
266,Bree,"god, i couldn't wait to get rid of them! so, lynette said that you found zack."
3154,Bree,"was i lucky, or were you following me?"
1968,Bree,oh!um.i don't do that.
2398,Bree,we have to do something.
1190,Bree,because i am starting to get that rash again.
997,Bree,"that darn insurance company is dragging its heels on paying rex's policy, and i don't understand why."
2559,Bree,"oh! sorry, probably just allergies, but, you know, you don't want to take any chances."
2540,Bree,"hey, it's our chemo party, and we'll laugh if we want to."
1609,Bree,you're awful.
851,Bree,excuse me?
3128,Bree,"no, you don't."
2276,Bree,what are you watching?
1916,Bree,"saw right through that, did ya?"
2972,Bree,"you know, susan, sometimes i climb into a warm bath with a romance novel. just a thought."
1081,Bree,andrew!
3942,Bree,we felt we owed it to your mom.
3029,Bree,susan 
1327,Bree,i don't think we are any more.
2775,Bree,"well, that doesn't make caring for an infant any less tiring. can't we just give it a chance?"
796,Bree,i would love to. rex?
2416,Bree,"she raped you,and your mother helped."
1206,Bree,i know.
1378,Bree,"andrew, i'm not trying to minimize my part in this. believe me, i, i hate myself for what's happened."
828,Bree,"no, he doesn't hate you. he hardly knows you, and you don't even really know him."
1225,Bree,hi.
1077,Bree,"you know, we've been eating out a lot lately. why don't you come over friday for a home-cooked meal. wouldn't that be nice?"
1678,Bree,"well,you're not my sponsor anymore,so i assume this is allowable.i mean,it's just a casual get-together."
702,Bree,i will not. we're gonna talk about this now.
324,Bree,"actually, i was thinking we could arrange for you to talk to a professional."
836,Bree,"yes. rex and i took a vacation there, right before the kids were born. we had so much fun in those first few years. i guess it was easier to be happy back then. i can't believe i just said that- no more wine for me. "
250,Bree,"sorry. i just - ah, come on, are you going to make a big deal about this?"
1292,Bree,"uh, yes, i am."
1624,Bree,what do you think you're doing?you're supposed to be grounded.
2059,Bree,"and you're not being hard enough. stop saying that what i did was understandable, i'm a mother who abandoned her child.that's-- unnatural."
321,Bree,thank you so much.
4101,Bree,are you insane? your thug tried to strangle him.
1127,Bree,"detective barton, you are clearly a gentleman."
3656,Bree,nonsense! it's a small price to pay to make your home more beautiful. i insist.
1808,Bree,"absolutely not.just give me an hour or two to straighten up andrew's room,and then you can bring your-- selves over."
2401,Bree,"oh, dear. i'm not sure how to tell you this, but--after alma knocked you out, she assaulted you."
2932,Bree,"yes, i'm gonna run some errands, and orson's gonna take benjamin to the park."
833,Bree,i don't know. but anything that good has got to be sinful.
119,Bree,can i come in?
3163,Bree,first we have to do something to stop that bleeding.
2933,Bree,benjamin doesn't love matisse. he loves purple. oh. please stop trying to turn our son into an intellectual.
3972,Bree,so did she get a good look at--death?
658,Bree,"oh, sweetie. they didn't abandon you because you're a whore. they abandoned you because you weren't all that nice to begin with."
30,Bree,"susan, are you alright? you look awful."
3804,Bree,and admirable.
1973,Bree,i have to go.
3271,Bree,"well, this isn't just about nutrition. do you want him to be teased at school every time he pulls tofu out of his lunchbox?"
4027,Bree,wipe your feet first. i just had the carpets cleaned. just because we're thieves doesn't mean we need to be untidy.
1791,Bree,"right. good. um,sorry.everybody,dig in."
1110,Bree,"i just think if i spend a lot of time with him, it'll really help."
358,Bree,"charming. what i was wondering was if you've bothered to spend any time reflecting on the reasons that you've been grounded, and all the pain that you've caused the solis family."
2948,Bree,"and i am-- up for the head of the ladies' auxiliary, and reverend sykes was so impressed that i brought a new family into church, so--if you don't come back, then--"
4003,Bree,so?
3498,Bree,"because she's your friend, and we're women. we don't do that to each other."
2968,Bree,"i acknowledge that katherine and i have had our differences, but we have all been through a lot recently."
2240,Bree,"orson, if there's something i should know."
4070,Bree,"my lawyer says you're entitled to half of everything we've acquired during the marriage, so i was trying to hide some of those things, since--let's face it-- i paid for them."
1638,Bree,"i'm raising a monster,is what i'm raising.it's no wonder i drink.i don't know why i said that."
2076,Bree,i'll never forgive myself. it's all my fault for pushing him away.
423,Bree,andrew!
1007,Bree,george. what are you doing here?
1946,Bree,"hi, hi, hi, hi.i'm so sorry i'm late."
2091,Bree,so you could do something.
2023,Bree,it's hodge now.
761,Bree,"lynette, don't. the fact that you just crossed that street means the world to me. and if anyone should apologise here, it's me."
3792,Bree,"well, i didn't really have a favorite. i loved them all equally."
1455,Bree,started?
144,Bree,that's someone's little girl. and that someone probably had a lot of dreams for her.dreams that did not include a thong and a pole.
1821,Bree,"no, relax.he's a very hip juggler.he only performs to beatles songs,and i saw the video,and it's absolutely thrilling."
2219,Bree,"well, how does he disappoint you?"
3454,Bree,"you are a vibrant, attractive woman, you--"
3677,Bree,"you know what else would be nice, alex? showing gratitude when people have been generous with you."
3605,Bree,a video store i will never return to. are you aware that one of the stars of this film is--
2586,Bree,something's come up. we'll talk tomorrow.
736,Bree,really?!
2369,Bree,"you went over there to read her the riot act. instead, it looked like you were reading her a bedtime story."
3588,Bree,"well, i just want you boys to know that i am comfortable with your lifestyle. now who would like a strawberry daiquiri?"
3880,Bree,why would you want to hurt me?
3785,Bree,"honey, please don't do this."
1894,Bree,"okay, there's no camp. that was a fib on my part.i found out that she ran away with a boy and the boy is a murderer."
1843,Bree,what the hell is wrong with you?!now it's ruined!everything is ruined!
2112,Bree,"well, that hardly bolsters his suitability. danielle, please, eat something."
2360,Bree,don't i wish.
3767,Bree,"well, i'm not the one who needed $20,000 to keep my business afloat."
2269,Bree,monique polier? i thought that was harvey bigsby's mistress.
885,Bree,don't say that.
1091,Bree,i'll be serving dinner tomorrow at seven. please don't be late.
2061,Bree,"yes, they are, aren't they?"
690,Bree,"all right, what about this one. it's in the desert and it's very reasonable. barracks are a little bit bleak, but that recidivism rate is to die for!"
1756,Bree,"peter,let me be your rock.taking care of people is what i do best.drink your milk."
2657,Bree,"""emotionally unavailable."" gosh, i wonder where she picked up that little phrase."
2064,Bree,"this is a family event, and we're all gonna enjoy it together. now, danielle, stop sniping and start thinking of an alibi for your brother."
792,Bree,"oh, andrew. thank you. you don't know how much that means to me."
422,Bree,"i'm sorry to disappoint you, andrew, but my plan is to have an embolism and to die young!"
1441,Bree,"yeah,why?"
3411,Bree,what are you doing?
2799,Bree,"he's in the exam room, readjusting the chair."
1583,Bree,"you know,on second thought, i won't be driving you to school.the walk will do you good."
491,Bree,"george, you shouldn't have."
2334,Bree,"oh, okay, just one minute. that'll be susan."
3479,Bree,"$2,000?!"
1512,Bree,excuse me?
578,Bree,"rex, please, i want to understand."
2054,Bree,"andrew, please, can't we just talk about this? i'm your mother, for god sakes! you're my son."
2116,Bree,"andrew, would you be a dear and make sure your sister's just breaking her own things? anyway--hmm. tish atherton--"
3260,Bree,i've already started. danielle! what a delightfully ethnic ensemble.
111,Bree,just some more about her nightmares and this girl she was afraid of.
99,Bree,"hotel by the interstate has better rates, and, uh, it's closer to your work."
1436,Bree,"oh,betty,if there's anything i can do,anything at all--"
4110,Bree,"well, it's obvious you've never had to remove a cheese stain. hmph!"
3580,Bree,"well, i want to know now, so that's why i'm having you and alex over to dinner tomorrow night."
3009,Bree,"well, um, as much as i appreciate this naked display of emotion, you know how this sort of thing makes me uncomfortable."
1261,Bree,"well, maybe they'll just be happy for you."
1757,Bree,hello?
3898,Bree,"orson, think about how i built this company from nothing, how it brings me joy and pride and a sense of accomplishment. is that really something you want me to give up?"
3107,Bree,"oh, this is a bit awkward, but my soon-to-be ex just walked in. he's been following me everywhere."
579,Bree,what the hell did your mother do to you?
3391,Bree,he's gonna be so ashamed of me.
3062,Bree,hi!
1464,Bree,"actually,my car has been impounded by the police."
1257,Bree,"horse manure. i have it delivered. susan makes fun of me, but the proof is in the pudding."
3020,Bree,excuse me?
3453,Bree,no.
4126,Bree,"i'll get back to you, uh, later."
1208,Bree,did i do anything embarrassing? sometimes i snore.
2992,Bree,"oh, no. no, dear. just you. maybe you should go home."
4109,Bree,"andrew, this is your mother. i am rapidly reaching the end of my patience with you. where are you? are you at a bar? andrew? andrew?"
2277,Bree,"it's fun looking back at the past, isn't it?"
3348,Bree,"yes. there's a luncheon on the 12th. i do hope you can make it. oh. by the way, you're right about those colors. very--jazzy."
76,Bree,i'll make braised lamb shanks.
2789,Bree,"so, um, not to pry, but, um, did that create any, uh, issues for you?"
3624,Bree,"melina, this is childish!"
1149,Bree,i'm changing it.
1522,Bree,"so take good care of your looks, danielle.you don't have any other weapons at your disposal."
1361,Bree,''more?''
3021,Bree,"yeah, sure. you know, i don't really think it's fair that you should profit from something that i designed."
468,Bree,there comes this point in every boy's life--
274,Bree,"well, he better be good, because when i'm finished with you, you won't have a cent to your name!"
3473,Bree,what?
2856,Bree,um-- a snake. what's the difference? he doesn't have one.
2105,Bree,"good afternoon. i'm, uh, bree hodge, and you are?"
2198,Bree,"thank god i found this stale baguette so i can make bruschetta, and there's shrimp in the freezer, so i'm gonna make my rice and seafood dish."
3609,Bree,so--he's the one?
3779,Bree,he's exaggerating. they're children. it just looks like a lot of money to them.
2481,Bree,"no,not at all!i'm just saying hello to a very dear friend of mine."
811,Bree,"honey, do your hands still tremble when they touch me?"
715,Bree,"you don't know what it means to me, rex. it's been a long time since i felt i had a real partner. and it really helps, especially on a horrible morning like this."
1372,Bree,that's andrew back from camp hennessey. i've got to go.
3075,Bree,"well, good, when they drop by for their inspection, i'll just have to have a nice little chat with them, too."
408,Bree,and have you fulfilled those needs?
2379,Bree,who knows? she's probably gonna sneak in and plant them in our house.
2123,Bree,pump her.
2941,Bree,i was gonna ask the same of you. why are you in a catholic church?
4058,Bree,that is not a doormat. that is a handwoven kurdish kazak rug.
1989,Bree,"no, of course not.i love you."
4039,Bree,"orson, we've been robbed!"
1260,Bree,"but why? i mean, surely they have friends who have children."
62,Bree,bye.
2202,Bree,i'm sure she won't mind. come on. let's go. come on.
3428,Bree,"my god, he's still there."
227,Bree,she!
3312,Bree,"girls, you are making way too much of this. i am not a bit more fabulous than any one of you. excuse me."
419,Bree,"i'm here to see rex van de kamp.apparently, he had a heart attack."
1376,Bree,"andrew, that is not fair."
1712,Bree,"you know,justin,if you would be willing to help,i'm pretty sure that i could find a way to keep andrew from moving.what do you say?"
1896,Bree,"i don't have time for therapy, you quack!now let me out of here!let go of me!you idiot. let go of me!"
657,Bree,i have fourteen thousand dollars in that account. it can all be yours.
2715,Bree,a what?
3595,Bree,"oh, my goodness, are you two--"
1689,Bree,"yeah.okay,bye."
2803,Bree,"is this about the other morning? oh, for heaven sakes, you can't be serious."
3643,Bree,guess who just called the burnt lamb chop?
3953,Bree,how?
1445,Bree,"all right,we'll split it."
3623,Bree,i am not bidding on time with my son.
2588,Bree,i have to bring this dvd player to danielle.
3193,Bree,"ah! oh, god. are you all right?"
3969,Bree,"oh, dear."
1119,Bree,george. george. george!
224,Bree,"oh, really. like what?"
883,Bree,"edie, do you want to be a part of it?"
1199,Bree,"so i was talking to one of the bellmen, and he said there's a place not far from here where we could go horseback riding. doesn't that sound like fun? george?"
541,Bree,"and even now, you know, after the betrayal, i, i know that we're supposed to be together. but i don't know how i can be with someone i don't trust."
2264,Bree,andrew!
2829,Bree,"yes. that was unfortunate. if you need any antibacterial soap, i-"
886,Bree,so could i.
560,Bree,"well, it won't be easy at first. there'll be a lot of forced smiles and perfunctory love making, but after a few decades whiz by i'm sure i'll find a way to forgive him."
3211,Bree,"orson, i adore you, but your name-- our name-- it has no music. ""van de kamp"" trips off the tongue. ""hodge"" sounds like the noise a plunger makes."
531,Bree,it's time for your heart medication.
2852,Bree,"oh, so now it's my fault that that lunatic commandeered our safe room?"
3923,Bree,"i stopped by the prison today. the guard tells me you've been visiting orson--sometimes twice a week, she said."
605,Bree,"so what are you saying, that the twins murdered martha?"
3201,Bree,"well, i think what gaby means is you were fairly awful to us right before you left, and this is our way of welcoming you back to hopefully not do it again."
1289,Bree,but if people see it--
2180,Bree,"orson? if you have a moment, there's something i'd like your thoughts on."
240,Bree,"no, i don't."
798,Bree,what thing? we don't have a thing.
2203,Bree,this is so sudden.
242,Bree,"""i love everything about it. the sensations, the smells. i especially love the feel of a man. all that muscle and sinew pressed against my body. and then, when you add friction. mmm -- the tactile sensation of running my tongue over a man's nipple ever so gently. and then there's the act itself - two bodies becoming one in that final eruption of pleasure. to be honest, the only thing i don't like about sex is the scrotum. i mean, obviously it has its practical applications, but i'm just not a fan."" "
1970,Bree,but orson!
3994,Bree,you don't say.
1954,Bree,"whatever you're alluding to, no."
3407,Bree,80?!
2423,Bree,and you think--
1778,Bree,"honey,you've got to eat something."
3400,Bree,"orson, stop throwing jail in my face. you cellmate was a crooked c.p.a., who helped you form a bridge club. it wasn't exactly attica."
3173,Bree,"katherine, hi. what are you doing here?"
2547,Bree,of course! i love your charades parties. and i hope you're inviting that delightful katherine mayfair.
3714,Bree,"you mean, with my life? i don't know."
938,Bree,"lynette, hi, it's bree. i do hope i's not calling too early. hmm? oh, of course you can borrow that scarf. i'll press it for you. um, i have, uh, some news. rex died."
3496,Bree,"katherine, i'm sorry, but i just have to ask--are you sure you know what you're doing?"
1958,Bree,ummm.ummm.i thought we--orson?
3245,Bree,you're still here? dinner is about to be served. whose seats are you in?
3793,Bree,"orson, why are you being so morbid?"
379,Bree,i take it you've met maisy gibbons.
906,Bree,"i don't know, rex. maybe you were bragging or maybe you just subconsciously wanted to hurt me. well, congratulations, you did it. i am officially destroyed."
873,Bree,"like famine, or disease, or hobos. whatever. just hurry."
1814,Bree,"honey, you've gotta let me make it up to you.i-i'm gonna throw you a birthday party with all your friends, okay?"
122,Bree,i spoke to brian's mother. now tell me again where you were last night and this time don't lie to me.
2643,Bree,"oh, he was happy to let you think that, but he was the one who dreaded your visits."
430,Bree,and why do you think that?
50,Bree,of course not.
848,Bree,you've got the wrong idea. that man is my pharmacist!
3776,Bree,this is a delicious snack. did you make this?
640,Bree,still? did you talk to him about that?
897,Bree,"well, thank you for telling me, but i think, um, i've got to go."
3200,Bree,"oh, i'm glad you're enjoying yourself."
3840,Bree,you took it. i saw you.
2313,Bree,that's our gift to them.
3270,Bree,this isn't about dinner. this is about her nutty liberal politics getting in the way of our grandson's nutrition.
3616,Bree,"oh, alex mentioned that you were laid off from your job. i'm so sorry."
3549,Bree,that doesn't sound right.
2923,Bree,get the keys ready. we'll slip out the back.
1333,Bree,"why don't you all take your seats? uh, dessert is about to be served."
1023,Bree,insurance investigator?
858,Bree,"i think that as soon as you're well enough we should go on a vacation. take a trip, go somewhere fun. remember our trip to italy?"
3902,Bree,"orson, please come upstairs. i know what that couch does to your back."
2034,Bree,"orson! my child is in trouble.don't make me choose between the two of you because believe me you will lose! now please, get your ass in gear!"
2897,Bree,"well, he doesn't mind."
1984,Bree,"oh well, come on in.let's dry you off and get you a drink."
615,Bree,"andrew, this is not funny."
3753,Bree,so that's like the dust they sweep off the floor of a place that makes real cheese.
488,Bree,"oh, and we got so lucky with the weather, it's just absolutely -"
1106,Bree,"because. ever since i found out what andrew said, i've been doing some soul searching and i realize that everything that's happened is completely my fault."
2665,Bree,"you know, phyllis, we cannot thank you enough for accepting our apology."
931,Bree,because i told you: the best is yet to come.
2692,Bree,"well, you say that now, but once you've held your child and felt that rush of love, well--it can change you."
64,Bree,"rex, rex! you need to get up!"
323,Bree,"andrew, um, i know the last few days have been stressful, and, uh, you know, if you ever need to talk to anybody--"
893,Bree,i'm sorry?
3392,Bree,i don't know if i can make it this time.
2804,Bree,just a bit dizzy from holding my breath in your stairwell. may i come in?
3203,Bree,"danielle, we agreed i would raise him. we agreed it would be best!"
3842,Bree,we will talk about this later.
869,Bree,what on earth?
3838,Bree,give it.
3673,Bree,"oh, i really couldn't say."
3832,Bree,this is not what i had in mind.
2469,Bree,"well,uh,dining chairs.there's a clue."
2418,Bree,"andrew, you're here. what happened to me?"
1494,Bree,"no, i'm not.and i forbid you to go over there."
3287,Bree,let's get you to the powder room.
2936,Bree,delightful? i thought she annoyed you.
2531,Bree,"well, that, um, hardly seems neighborly. after all, i just gave you the recipe for my mincemeat pie."
2164,Bree,"oh, they are a regular barrel of--tish!"
2851,Bree,we're giving you shelter. you could at least be gracious.
3684,Bree,"andrew, please. you were there. alex started the whole thing. you need to tell him to stop criticizing me."
3461,Bree,"me, too. you go first."
1239,Bree,hey. we'd better hurry. the movie starts in twenty minutes.
4056,Bree,"orson, we've been robbed."
2685,Bree,how many times have i told you to stay away from the windows?
2376,Bree,"well, okay-- i have to go."
754,Bree,no.
3558,Bree,what?
1046,Bree,i'll waive all that. my only stipulation is that i want my children to be able to see me answer the questions.
1043,Bree,"i was in shock, danielle. you know that. andrew, surely you don't think i murdered your father."
911,Bree,i know. i'm gonna take him to the hospital.
2463,Bree,"oh, don't remind me."
2128,Bree,i have never in my life used the word retard.
3360,Bree,"would you excuse us, please?"
4075,Bree,what are you doing?
681,Bree,take your time.
1628,Bree,"oh,and why is that?"
16,Bree,that certainly would explain why you're always locked in the bathroom.
2998,Bree,"ever since i started working with that obnoxious backstabber, she's done nothing but try to take the spotlight off of me and put it onto her."
1682,Bree,i don't need donna.i need you.
3339,Bree,"goodness, lynette. when you offered to share your thoughts on my campaign, i wasn't expecting anything quite so--elaborate."
1934,Bree,do it.
3057,Bree,"good night. okay, back to business. how do you feel about parker house rolls? i mean, personally, i think they're played out."
3100,Bree,it has a very distinct ring.
2945,Bree,i am not! my friend's just a little confused. she forgot that she's presbyterian and wandered into the wrong church.
3671,Bree,and bring some steak sauce.
263,Bree,what happened?
3366,Bree,i'm not angry with you. i'm just sorry that you felt so--
445,Bree,"oh, right on time!"
2513,Bree,this is not my pie.
313,Bree,"""you know, no matter how the kids turn out, i still love them.''"
2710,Bree,"oh, dear heavenly lord."
1459,Bree,"well,how am i supposed to get home? i don't have any money."
801,Bree,"good, then it's a date."
691,Bree,"it's easy for you, isn't it? you're not the one he's openly rude to. you're not the one he challenges every day. you're not the one he hates."
2228,Bree,you'd never ask a magician how a trick is done.
1995,Bree,"well, orson and i talked about it and we just feel at our age, it's silly to wait. and with your help, i'm sure we can get it all done."
963,Bree,"reverend, if you don't back me up on this, so help me, i will pull the funeral out of your church."
32,Bree,"it's a letter, addressed to mary alice."
1207,Bree,"oh, okay. have you been sitting there all this time?"
919,Bree,mm-hmm.
1825,Bree,"oh, susan,did i wake you?"
1410,Bree,absolutely not.i think the best thing to do is just smile and pretend you don't know anything.
3267,Bree,excuse me?
2477,Bree,"the nice thing about this fake pregnancy is my feet don't swell.i mean,i'd never be able to squeeze into these sling-backs if i really was 8-12 months pregnant."
534,Bree,would that hurt you rex? if i slept with another man?
2544,Bree,"well, i doubt a woman like katherine is gonna spill her secrets just - because she's had a little win"
604,Bree,"well, we can't put it back in his room. i mean that would be like we're condoning him having pre-marital sex."
1745,Bree,"well, aren't you the renaissance man."
377,Bree,good. where does andrew keep his marijuana?
141,Bree,fine.
2077,Bree,"how does this dr. keck fit into all of this? i mean, is he treating andrew for some awful disease?"
1983,Bree,"yes, and you are?"
2651,Bree,"hi. it's, uh, mrs. hodge. may i please speak with danielle?"
1897,Bree,"if anything happens to my daughter, so help me, god--"
1539,Bree,your crime?
2366,Bree,"i try to hold my head up and smile and just bake more pies for the church social. but now your ex is camped out on our doorstep like i am hosting some kind of mormon slumber party, and i do not know how i am gonna bake my way out of this one!"
2083,Bree,"okay, that's what i was thinking."
485,Bree,i'm gonna miss her.
3665,Bree,but?
3728,Bree,thank god i didn't show her how the car parks itself.
2421,Bree,but why?
3065,Bree,"oh, yes, the neighborhood's safe. i wish i could say the same for your real estate agent."
1385,Bree,"george didn't intend to commit suicide. he was trying to manipulate me into taking him back and he swallowed those pills hoping that i'd feel sorry for him. he just assumed that i would call an ambulance. when i got there, he was already slipping away. i tried to get him to accept responsibility for what he'd done, but he wouldn't."
3032,Bree,"you adored it, as i recall. that's why i'm giving you the choice. and what about that hummel from your aunt? it's ugly as sin, but she insists that it's valuable."
2642,Bree,then why did he always avoid you? why were you barely ever here?
1683,Bree,eleanor!
26,Bree,oh wait?
1462,Bree,"oh,oh,i'm fine.i just,um,had a flat tire."
2047,Bree,how very saucy.
135,Bree,"no, he won't. just act normal."
3592,Bree,i hear the gym is a popular meeting place.
1082,Bree,george.
1375,Bree,"well, the detective seems to think he was trying to get your father out of the way so he could marry me. honey, please use your coaster. that's gonna leave a ring."
487,Bree,"i was so afraid when i suggested a picnic, that you'd make fun of me, but i just think it's such a lovely, old-fashioned way to spend an afternoon."
984,Bree,"phyllis, there are people waiting, so--"
1488,Bree,i wanted to talk to you about what happened the other day with the kids.
2618,Bree,"oh, that's all right. i've got them, mr. knievel."
895,Bree,you heard that?
712,Bree,"honey, it's going to be okay, i promise."
3042,Bree,except for the occasional hit-and-run.
724,Bree,"because the minute i get there, andrew will start attacking me for abandoning him and i don't want to hear it."
1812,Bree,what?
3039,Bree,very well. so do you want the cat or not?
3803,Bree,"you know, katherine, if you need any help, i would be happy to make my fam--"
1156,Bree,right this way.
154,Bree,three months.
3302,Bree,these are advanced copies. i wanted you to be the first to have them.
3043,Bree,you are?
727,Bree,"oh lynette, i'm so swamped today. my house is a mess and i've got millions of errands to run."
1878,Bree,"is that what you're doing, asking me all those ridiculous questions about my childhood, trying to get to know me? well, here's a clue. i'm not crazy.i just have a few issues."
3571,Bree,my husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested.
2139,Bree,good.then we're all set.here are some of her clothes.i'll bring her cds and her stuffed animals over tomorrow.
2350,Bree,you heard me. get out!
1005,Bree,that's all right. it was really sweet of you to stop by.
3710,Bree,you think i'm just like every other housewife?
561,Bree,"i do want to forgive him doctor goldfine, but, there's something he's still not telling me."
3786,Bree,"orson, drop it. i am not telling you how much andrew makes."
738,Bree,"porter, i warned you."
3285,Bree,"yes. yes, it is."
990,Bree,"so am i, but no one would ever know it with your incessant caterwauling."
1067,Bree,"but according to the polygraph, that wasn't exactly true."
3419,Bree,yes. he said you were roommates back in college.
522,Bree,you can lean on me.
2352,Bree,"alma! i-i didn't know that, uh, you knew edie."
2773,Bree,"this isn't just for me and benjamin. this will help you bond with him, too."
3268,Bree,oh. well-- since when?
3757,Bree,"if this doesn't stop your mother-in-law from criticizing your cooking, i will give you a full refund."
3377,Bree,i'd rather you not talk about the job tonight.
2707,Bree,"okay, you made your point.now go home."
3951,Bree,really? that soon?
490,Bree,"another gift? i hope it's not another orchid, they're so expensive."
2069,Bree,drama camp. a very prestigious drama camp.
1013,Bree,"i'm, uh, i'm going to see rex's lawyer. we're going to go over some details involving rex's will. phyllis, obviously, i'm just mortified over slapping you. i, i've just been in a weird place since rex's death, but, that's no excuse. i'm very, very sorry."
3040,Bree,"orson, what are you doing here?"
3540,Bree,"orson, if we can't share a bed, it's going to hurt the intimacy of our marriage."
4095,Bree,you were assaulted?
3979,Bree,enjoy your tea.
2443,Bree,i'm so sorry to be putting you through this. i-i wouldn't blame you if you ran like hell and never looked back.
2723,Bree,he looks just like you did. do you want to be alone with him? do you want me to--to go? what should i do?
3901,Bree,"steal what you must, my love. but it won't be my company."
1047,Bree,yes.
3325,Bree,"apparently, we've been named businesswoman of the year."
1473,Bree,"danielle?honey, are you in there?"
2199,Bree,"i had to tell her. she hurt me, so i hurt her back. if anything should happen to julie or lynette--"
1855,Bree,i think i'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
2538,Bree,i just let myself into katherine's house to get that recipe.
508,Bree,#name?
987,Bree,then why didn't you put me on?
2086,Bree,"gaby, are you and carlos getting back together?"
841,Bree,"but honey, we socialise with them. what am i going to say to helen?"
1492,Bree,it's the applewhites. i don't want you to go near them.
1320,Bree,"george, would you please sit down? you're being rude."
2596,Bree,"no, you're pregnant, too. i'm not gonna tell you anything that's gonna worry you."
3064,Bree,so are you thinking of moving onto the lane?
2916,Bree,"oh, don't go catholic. all that standing and kneeling and genuflecting--i go for worship, not a workout."
705,Bree,"all right, people. we're going to follow the body. this way please."
1086,Bree,"i don't care. here, put this on. every time you leave this house, you represent this family. and the least you can do is not humiliate us."
2575,Bree,"oh, susan, i am so sorry, and, of course, i will pay for the slashed tire and the stolen cell phone."
2734,Bree,we know what it is.
1724,Bree,"maybe not,but it's no longer my concern now that he'll be living with you."
1598,Bree,"perception is reality,andrew.and if people perceive me to have a drinking problem,then i do.and i certainly don't want some idiotic judge using my hobby as an excuse to make you rich.so i'm simply going to give up my wine and become a recovering alcoholic."
2029,Bree,"i don't need to be any happier than i am at this very second. oh, my goodness, there's only fifteen minutes before our plane.if you want that latte you should go now."
569,Bree,roses and english toffee?
1605,Bree,"perception is reality, andrew."
2900,Bree,leave us.
1474,Bree,really? because i'm holding your backpack with all your schoolbooks.
2702,Bree,"cher, the beloved pop diva."
2798,Bree,"hello, adam."
502,Bree,here. take the gun.
1606,Bree,"my name is bree, and i am an alcoholic."
499,Bree,"oh, george, that's so sweet. now come on, let's go shoot something!"
3550,Bree,whatever.
1130,Bree,"anyway, i was hoping that you were all free friday morning because that's when i'll be hosting the re-burial."
282,Bree,don't you two see what he is doing? he's trying to get you on his side. he's trying to buy your love.
1438,Bree,"although,i have to confess,i do have an ulterior motive.i need to ask you a favor."
1481,Bree,"oh, honey,why would i want that?"
2181,Bree,"no, it's the police report from the night you beat your first wife. i'm still working on the menu."
2006,Bree,he did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid.
1365,Bree,''what is that?''
3067,Bree,it's not really a good time.
3745,Bree,"well, don't thank me. it was your idea."
1429,Bree,i don't think i can do that.
3000,Bree,"i certainly, uh, wasn't expecting it."
4111,Bree,what just happened?
2832,Bree,"well, you're only human."
1923,Bree,"i would beg my son andrew for forgiveness for having given up on him, and i would tell my daughter not to worry, that i have a plan to protect her."
3606,Bree,you do?
809,Bree,"well, i certainly don't want to hurt him,again."
3965,Bree,katherine. hi. what are you doing here?
3309,Bree,very funny. i hardly think you have to worry about me becoming famous.
3539,Bree,"this is absolutely necessary. i am going through a very stressful time. i have interviews, that cooking demonstration at the mall. if i don't get my rest, it could affect the launch of my book."
1454,Bree,i'd rather you didn't.
131,Bree,it's nine thirty at night. what is your brother thinking?
1223,Bree,"oh. george, this is just, uh, an empty house. why is this a surprise?"
193,Bree,"zach,calm down."
3608,Bree,and you're okay with this?
1755,Bree,"yes, and in that time,i've come to learn that you're good and kind and smart.and, yes,you have a little problem that you need some help with,but i'm willing to be there for you.so what's the big deal?"
2637,Bree,"well, um--technically, yes."
3112,Bree,what does that mean?
697,Bree,"andrew, i need you to take out the trash."
1670,Bree,hmm. some muffins?
3224,Bree,"okay, now i'm terrified."
124,Bree,"well, it's just temporary and-i thought it would upset you, so i was protecting you."
3010,Bree,no. never.
463,Bree,the only reason he is still in the house is because you insisted i care for him.
1822,Bree,"danielle, i just want you to have the best party you have ever had in your entire life."
94,Bree,"for what, zach?"
1622,Bree,"andrew,there may be a judge out there stupid enough to emancipate you,but until you find him,i retain all my parental rights,one of which is to ground your sorry behind until kingdom come.mr bormanis,nice to see you again.and,um,please don't get crumbs on my carpet."
1840,Bree,"it's just a cake, for god sakes.will you please just cut it?"
1317,Bree,"oh, my goodness. oh, george, this is ty grant. we used to date in college. ty, this is george, um, he's a good friend of mine."
2480,Bree,perhaps i need to make my point a little more clearly.
1692,Bree,"fine!yes,um--so,um,who goes first?"
3556,Bree,i'm so thirsty.
3449,Bree,you can't just move because of one bad date.
613,Bree,you may be able to abdicate all your parental responsibility but i cannot.
3732,Bree,why not? what's the point of success if you can't share it with the people you love?
3410,Bree,"i don't know--read, relax, give yourself a pedicure."
3027,Bree,will someone please tell me what's going on?
2842,Bree,i can't help having a sympathetic face.
3674,Bree,no. i wouldn't want to upset anyone.
991,Bree,"people want to know how i'm doing, but the minute they ask, you, you jump into the spotlight, and they forget all about me. i need consoling, too, phyllis. have you ever thought of that?"
787,Bree,"about four weeks old. i never told you this, but when i gave birth to you, there were complications. the umbilical chord wrapped around your neck and you stopped breathing. the room got very quiet, and i knew you were in trouble. so i turned to the doctor and i very calmly said that he was not to worry about me, that his job was to save your life. when i say i would die for you, that's not just an expression. i mean it."
2222,Bree,"yes, i see. well, surely this rift isn't irreparable."
1982,Bree,"hi, can i help you?"
2604,Bree,yes?
3034,Bree,"orson, every wife understands that her husband will make a few mistakes--a forgotten anniversary, the occasional harsh word, but we all have to draw the line somewhere, and i'm drawing mine at the attempted murder of my best friend's husband."
3968,Bree,death?
1336,Bree,"i do know that, but i'm just not sure you're a good one, either."
3311,Bree,"oh, right! of course. i would, uh, love to hear your thoughts."
3363,Bree,i never said that.
2455,Bree,andrew?
4106,Bree,"what? karl--if i have not been clear about how i feel about you, i apologize for any ambiguity. understand this--i detest you."
1147,Bree,i'm sorry. i was just attending to some last minute details. right this way.
631,Bree,"well, she feels very passionately about you."
2400,Bree,"i'm sorry, but you've been out cold for ten hours, and we need to talk."
256,Bree,"how many years have we been making love, and you've started to ask me something, but then you stop?"
350,Bree,"oh, good nannies are so hard to find."
162,Bree,"it's just that i'm very well respected at barcliff, and my word won't be good there anymore."
942,Bree,"no. no, i can't afford to fall apart right now."
1947,Bree,"well, it's a very elegant club.you know orson's been a member here for years. it will be even nicer when they finish the construction."
2310,Bree,"well, first you pack up your things and come home, and then we toss your mother out on her evil ass."
3871,Bree,"after i told you to stay out of the neighbors' houses? you stole again, didn't you?"
608,Bree,"well, not recently, and i'd prefer not to tie up the line."
3747,Bree,certainly.
3283,Bree,you have to promise not to tell your mommy.
3569,Bree,"well, over time, you'll learn that there's a balance of power in relationships, and if your beloved ever pulls a nasty trick on you, like say, drugging you into a stupor, then the balance of power shifts to you, and then you can demand they prove their love by, say, undergoing surgery. do you understand?"
945,Bree,"here's your tea, phyllis."
1945,Bree,"yes, i will marry you, orson."
2335,Bree,"oh, you didn't have to do that."
343,Bree,i think we should make him quit the swim team.
876,Bree,i told you in confidence. how dare you throw it back in my face.
1472,Bree,"andrew,give me one good reason why shouldn't call the police."
852,Bree,"oh. oh, i mean, everybody needs someone to talk to."
1029,Bree,"well, if i am, you're wasting your time. i loved rex and anyone who knows me will tell you that i was incapable of hurting him."
2237,Bree,just for a few weeks till we find a place where she'll be happier. you should've heard her in the car. she's absolutely miserable in that nursing home.
3018,Bree,i think it's our creative friction that nearly caused me to poison you.
3468,Bree,"ooh! oh, this counter's hard on my head."
2765,Bree,"i gave them very serious consideration. but it's my blood running in his veins, which ultimately makes it my decision."
3510,Bree,"and this is my own little kitchen. i'm pretty sure my husband's here somewhere. orson, dear, are you decent?"
3191,Bree,"this is my kitchen, and this is my staff--the most gifted, hardworking team a cook could ever have hoped for. i cannot say enough good things about them."
2833,Bree,"well, they seem-- content."
28,Bree,what's that supposed to mean?
3223,Bree,"oh, you know michelle?"
2888,Bree,"watch your mouth. i would never suggest that. you can raise a man's hopes without satisfying them. i've done it all my life. andrew, i have got to get back into my house, and you're my only hope."
1298,Bree,i think it's time for you to leave.
3936,Bree,i think we're here.
2731,Bree,"and you'd better apply now. debbie gottlieb had her baby the same day i did, and she could only get wait-listed at her first three choices. oh, by the way, we were invited to her bris this saturday."
1332,Bree,"i am not kidding. if you do not knock it off, i'm going to call the police!"
1414,Bree,"i am serious, andrew.you tell him to get out of here this second or i will call the police, and i will have him removed!"
1004,Bree,"um, yeah. sure. hold on a second."
1612,Bree,"okay, you got me.i'm not really an alcoholic."
806,Bree,he does not seem desperate to me.
799,Bree,"rex, are you still jealous?"
1860,Bree,please don't make excuses for him.that is exactly what his father does. rex!
524,Bree,you shouldn't listen to a woman who's just had her heart broken.
3181,Bree,"well, it's certainly nice to meet you, dave, and let us be the first to welcome you to wisteria lane."
2049,Bree,"excuse me, young man. have you seen this boy?andrew! oh, my god, thank god!"
3933,Bree,"i meant for asking you to come here, for insisting you turn yourself in. oh. now that i see this place, i don't know what i were thinking."
818,Bree,why didn't you tell me?
1173,Bree,"how are we going to do that, george? you have just given me hives."
2622,Bree,oh! so you're responsible--
1848,Bree,"it was the oddest sensation.i was fine,and everything was fine,and then suddenly i was on the outside of my body watching a woman who looked like me becoming a raving maniac."
3487,Bree,you watched it?!
369,Bree,"not all of us! rex, i thought you moved back home to try and straighten andrew out! to, to teach him the consequences of his actions. i don't understand why you're fighting me on this."
3829,Bree,"i'm going to put some coffee on. orson, would you give me a hand? let these three chat."
1213,Bree,mmm.
1898,Bree,have they rung up your prescription yet?
3185,Bree,excuse me?
2106,Bree,"actually, gus, um, i'm here to see one of your guests-- a gentleman named faladi."
279,Bree,"rex, what's this about?"
3666,Bree,"""tough""? that's not a word i would use to describe myself."
2138,Bree,"yes, danielle made it quite clear that i'm powerless to stop this relationship, and since she assures me that you love her. you do love her, don't you?"
2920,Bree,"lynette, please, we don't do that here."
3707,Bree,"oh, we're having leftovers. you can heat them up yourself if you want."
265,Bree,i will be right in.
415,Bree,"that's okay. how are you now, rex? are you strong enough to listen to the things i need to tell you?"
2322,Bree,sour cream.
3557,Bree,that's all right. i'll just drink this tea.
1018,Bree,i was simply asking when you were planning to leave. there was no agenda behind the question.
1685,Bree,it's a recent development. where's dad?
294,Bree,"oh, andrew, thank god you're back. i need your help, honey. there's been an accident. andrew?"
3980,Bree,orson's lying to me again. so i think i have to divorce him.
3250,Bree,"at this point, i would just run off screaming into the night."
2608,Bree,you know how i feel about 2-wheeled motorized vehicles. they're too dangerous. we'll donate it to the church.
3632,Bree,ah! here you are.
733,Bree,"porter, what did i tell you?"
2767,Bree,i know that.
1187,Bree,"i don't know. i thought maybe we could go antiquing."" ""i hear you have some lovely museums nearby. do you have any brochures?"
237,Bree,"well, what a coincidence. so am i. it seems a shame for us to eat by ourselves. shall i, pull up a chair?"
2189,Bree,"well, i guess that makes us neighbors."
3327,Bree,aw.
2822,Bree,"good, because i already--told him."
1237,Bree,"yes, we saw aida last week and we both cried buckets. it was fun. george loves art, poetry, and music. it would be nice to be married to someone who looks for beauty in the world like i do. i don't know. that's why i'm here. i don't know what to do, dr. goldfine."
1566,Bree,"no!ah,you know,i may have had just the tiniest little bit of chardonnay."
1311,Bree,"oh, um, the, the stone is loose. so i'm gonna take it to the jewelers. but don't worry, it's safe."
2297,Bree,at his office. and what did you think you'd find there anyway?
3237,Bree,"orson, please don't be hurt. i am under so much pressure and so terrified i'll fail that i don't even know what i'm saying half the time. just let me get through this. as soon as the plates go out tonight, i will come home and cook you that pot roast i promised. okay?"
2430,Bree,so we're back to being friends?
1714,Bree,"so tell me,how are you doing?i mean,your entire world must be turned upside down.you must be exhausted."
1719,Bree,"all right,here we go.this is the last of andrew's things.once we tape up these boxes,we can start loading the car."
2663,Bree,let him talk.
2487,Bree,"i mean,it's one thing to forgive bad behavior. it's another thing to reward it.there are consequences for her mistakes."
113,Bree,gabby!!
3119,Bree,"oh, reverend green, please don't be upset."
1816,Bree,"but, sweetheart, this is--this is his room."
1493,Bree,do you remember the man they arrested--the one that broke into gabrielle's and escaped from the mental hospital?he's there.i saw him in their window.they're hiding him.
2740,Bree,i hope orson 's rant didn't give you a headache.
4076,Bree,"i don't need any help. and besides, my parisian salad doesn't call for any chives."
3663,Bree,"what exactly are you saying, alex?"
107,Bree,"if you would just tell me what he told you, then i could fix the problem."
3443,Bree,"oh, i just really wish you'd taken things more slowly."
3998,Bree,"yes, i know that comes as a surprise."
2894,Bree,"exactly, and now, um, his tastes have gone to the more mature, cultured types, like, uh, walter here."
1278,Bree,"so we're gonna go to my house. i made banana bread, and we'll put on a fresh pot, and just talk about anything."
1204,Bree,"oh, well, i'm drinking wine. i don't think you're supposed to mix pills with alcohol."
3137,Bree,"and dancing, roll out the cake, you leave for your honeymoon, and i will collapse in a tasteful heap."
397,Bree,"oh, hi gabrielle! what have you got there?"
2984,Bree,"thank you, mrs. downing. listen, when i present the founder's award tonight, i was wondering--"
918,Bree,"you know what? i am so happy that you guys came here, i really am, but i am trying really hard to be strong, so if you keep comforting me--"
829,Bree,"well, that's not his choice to make."
1549,Bree,there. is that better?
2363,Bree,"oh, so you're just gonna wait until she moves in?"
1027,Bree,anomalies? what anomalies?
3958,Bree,i did not raise you to be bitchy.
1203,Bree,"oh. well, okay."
2786,Bree,"oh, thank you."
1781,Bree,out of the question.
1168,Bree,i don't know. i'm just really starting to itch.
3109,Bree,"ah, it worked. thank you for that."
3113,Bree,reverend green!
1654,Bree,hello.
1095,Bree,i can't believe how well those two are getting along.
1255,Bree,"oh, dear. what's wrong?"
924,Bree,and do you know why i save it for last?
2247,Bree,"yeah, and she'll take terrible care of herself and be dead in a year."
1427,Bree,what noises?
1165,Bree,oh!
567,Bree,and the dinner parties. don't forget the dinner parties.
2771,Bree,"he's fine, but i've been doing so reading, and more and more people say that babies sleep better next to their parents. it's called the ""family bed""."
72,Bree,works for me. should we all make something?
3725,Bree,"was it just me, or was that a little abrupt?"
103,Bree,"rex. in college, when we first started dating, people were so jealous of us. we were the golden couple. everybody knew we were gonna have this wonderful life. why is this happening?"
1094,Bree,"oh, you don't know the lengths i'd go to for even seating."
2117,Bree,"i'm telling you, it was a deliberate snub. i waved to her, and she looked right through me. true, i never bought her eldest daughter a gift--"
4015,Bree,what are you doing up so late?
210,Bree,"zach,why did you do this?"
651,Bree,"i was wondering if, perhaps, you could remove rex's name from that little book."
3483,Bree,ha. you got the tape!
2212,Bree,"but if she's only thirty minutes away, why haven't you been visiting her?"
1323,Bree,"see, the thing is, i don't think we are anymore."
980,Bree,that's very sweet of you. thank you.
3555,Bree,9:15? huh? 9:15. i'm supposed to be at the mall. did i forget to set the alarm?
1228,Bree,"george, rex hasn't even been dead for two months."
744,Bree,"sorry, i didn't know. it won't happen again. of course, i'm a somewhat surprised you don't hit them, i mean everyone knows they're a little bit out of control."
2693,Bree,"i'm just saying, if i were you, i might be feeling--"
1538,Bree,"yes, i did.i also noticed that you had him chained in the basement."
526,Bree,i want to keep the club membership. rex is terrible at tennis. and he hates buffets.
865,Bree,"okay, time's up. take your best shot."
564,Bree,"i realize that. this thing that he's hiding, is it bad?"
779,Bree,so?
2389,Bree,hi. sorry. my book club ran late. didn't orson make you dinner?
932,Bree,hello?
2882,Bree,you know what else you two have in common? a love of boots.
2462,Bree,that would be lovely.
1433,Bree,"oh,it was no trouble at all."
2857,Bree,oh. sorry.
3451,Bree,"well, what could be more sisterly than that? i know i'm not the most--demonstrative--person, but i care about you deeply, and if you were to just walk out of my life, i would be very--very unhappy."
2358,Bree,"they had a dungeon in the basement.i mean, people say they still hear groans coming from the house at night."
971,Bree,wait!
3750,Bree,"well, you might have to. excuse me."
1105,Bree,"but, zach is mary alice's son. he grew up playing in our yards. if he has any hope of surviving, i have to believe he's better off here than on the street."
1782,Bree,"until they lock caleb up,i don't want you anywhere near that family."
3659,Bree,"he only thinks he got a good deal because the salesman threw in one of those ""kiss the cook"" hats."
2410,Bree,exonerate mike. how could you stand by and let an innocent man be dragged off to prison?
3819,Bree,great. i'll call bruce this afternoon.
105,Bree,i didn't have time to make an appointment. rex moved out today.
275,Bree,"but whatever problems your father and i have, it doesn't change the fact that we love you very, very much,"
632,Bree,"oh, are you going steady?"
2033,Bree,my son is eating out of dumpsters!
3802,Bree,"no, i'm just saying you're worth--less."
860,Bree,it doesn't matter. you decide.
367,Bree,because i want you to pull him from the swim team and i don't think you'll allow it without proof.
2013,Bree,"before we do this, there's something i need to ask you."
3777,Bree,a tiny salary bump.
2299,Bree,good. let me know if there are any survivors.
1065,Bree,they asked me if i loved you.
1318,Bree,"ty, would you like to dance?"
3190,Bree,we are. that's why your name is on the dedication page.
3886,Bree,"yes, am i speaking to mr. dinsmore? ah, this is bree van de kamp. yes, it's nice to talk to you, too. well, as i'm sure you're aware, your company has made several offers to purchase mine. yes, i know i said i wasn't interested, but some things have happened in my personal life and i think i'm ready to--finally make a deal. really? well, that's wonderful. why don't you, uh, come to my office tomorrow and we'll talk? good-bye, mr. dinsmore."
4032,Bree,fine! but do you have to do it with such relish?
3117,Bree,oh! aah! oh.
3147,Bree,"why don't you fill water glasses? that's an important job, too."
1030,Bree,you talked to phyllis.
505,Bree,"oh, i was making macaroons before i left the house."
3647,Bree,i bought you the adams house!
3291,Bree,"i gave him a hot dog, all right? he liked it so much, he asked for another."
1877,Bree,why would you assume that?
3795,Bree,who told you that?
3962,Bree,"hello, my love."
3990,Bree,"well, that's the rule. there's nothing you can do about it. so stop bitching."
101,Bree,"umm, i can tell them that you went to tennis camp. that was a joke."
3679,Bree,"well, why not? it was a fairly grand gesture on my part."
2982,Bree,"oh, dear. well, i should throw this dip out."
1042,Bree,"yes, we had issues, but i would never have hurt him."
3036,Bree,turn yourself in to the police.
1349,Bree,what?
2245,Bree,i have done everything i can to make you happy and comfortable. what do you want from us?
1517,Bree,"why should i?you betrayed this family,and you're not even sorry."
4059,Bree,"give me that. i'm so glad this divorce is almost over. an obnoxious, unpleasant man will be out of my life, and so will orson."
1835,Bree,who touched this?
1594,Bree,so that's what this is about--your trust fund?
789,Bree,"please, he can counsel you. it can help."
3056,Bree,"oh, hello, dylan. you look lovely."
2281,Bree,"well, i will take that under advisement."
495,Bree,"oh, absolutely. george, this is just so much better than an orchid."
1890,Bree,hello?
2167,Bree,nice to be seen.
1834,Bree,all righty.
3573,Bree,leaving the man a thank-you card.
41,Bree,"you're gonna cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer, and we're gonna find ourselves a marriage counsellor."
3966,Bree,"oh, right. i heard she was here."
2919,Bree,what? no. put your hand down.
3755,Bree,"uh, take your time. i'm sorry. we haven't been introduced. i'm bree hodge, part owner."
2098,Bree,i am so tired of feeling like the worst mother who ever lived.
2157,Bree,did you see that? she just deliberately snubbed me.
888,Bree,"all i'm saying is that we're both gonna die eventually, and in the time that we have left, whether it's two days or two decades, i think that we should be nice to each other."
2766,Bree,of course not.
226,Bree,and what would this sexual surrogate person do?
4060,Bree,"no, he thinks i filed it."
2929,Bree,"well, it's just that in our church, people don't talk back to the minister."
3138,Bree,"oh! yes, i'm sorry. one cherub delivered at 1:30."
4012,Bree,"m.j., there's someone in my life who hits me with a dead squirrel every single day. and you are the only one who can help me. please, please invite evan to your party."
3645,Bree,yes. a good opportunity for andrew to commute five hours to his job.
2816,Bree,"oh, my god. this is gonna kill edie."
3073,Bree,"i've already hired one. you'll be hearing from him shortly. oh, and if you're in the mood for a carnival, why not call edie? i hear you get three throws for a dollar with her, too."
759,Bree,what?
720,Bree,"well, i'm making him this care package. i mean he'll know i'm thinking about him."
370,Bree,i never pushed you around. we always made our decisions together.
1540,Bree,tony?do you have to rush off?i thought maybe we could just chat for a minute.
2592,Bree,i am so sorry that i snapped at you tonight.
3104,Bree,"they'll love that. this is gonna be the best seniors' brunch ever. i'm so glad you're back. between you and me, reverend sykes tended to pander to the congregation's progressive element. i prefer your more muscular brand of christianity."
2040,Bree,he didn't run away.i kicked him out.
3308,Bree,"thank you, katherine. i will never become stuck-up and full of myself."
1417,Bree,andrew--
4025,Bree,go on.
2311,Bree,i am no longer interested in your opinion. i thought i made that clear.
3855,Bree,a thrill? stealing a ceramic duck gives you a thrill?
1964,Bree,you don't have to wash those.i already did them.
1933,Bree,#name?
2991,Bree,"katherine, darling, are you okay?"
2422,Bree,for what?
2307,Bree,"well, you could've left her."
3570,Bree,"you will. come along, orson."
1874,Bree,"well, that was-- very sweet."
555,Bree,all i know is this: mary alice loved zach more than anything in the world. when you love a child that much--
1299,Bree,"i say, given your overall demeanor and your freewheeling use of epithets, i'm willing to bet that he was provoked."
2129,Bree,andrew! not in front of the therapist.
1024,Bree,"i don't know what you're talking about, phyllis."
3720,Bree,i don't think i do that.
1753,Bree,"well, if you were in trouble,i could handle it."
2326,Bree,susan. hi. it's bree.
912,Bree,when i finish making the bed.
2420,Bree,suicide? no.orson would never try to kill himself.the police are wrong.it must have been an accident.
3691,Bree,"i don't know. what do you think, gaby? gaby?"
3329,Bree,you wanna work here?
172,Bree,you're right. that was hard to hear.
3415,Bree,"katherine, you are a vibrant, attractive woman. you--"
948,Bree,"i don't think so, but thank you, though."
2085,Bree,"be that as it may, do we all agree that i should tell this man's wife?"
3782,Bree,i like the way you think. what would we do without him?
3529,Bree,"occasionally, but never quite this--"
1164,Bree,"well, i thought we were going to let the duck digest a bit more, but what the heck."
3376,Bree,"um, actually, dear--"
1879,Bree,"honestly, i was hoping that you'd medicate the hell out of me."
2581,Bree,good idea.
2524,Bree,what? surrender? debase myself?
722,Bree,"fine, i won't send them but i think it's a stupid rule."
4077,Bree,my salad has plenty of bite. so--when are you moving out?
178,Bree,"oh.well,, i guess i can do it by myself."
3448,Bree,"oh, i am so, so sorry."
2371,Bree,about what it's gonna take to get you to sell this house and move.
3444,Bree,"no, i'm not."
486,Bree,"damn, i have to take rex to his angiogram."
2750,Bree,i can tell you someone whose sexual pleasure is going to be reduced big-time!
1818,Bree,surprise!
760,Bree,"well, he was right. i'll be waiting in the car."
3478,Bree,"we need to, um, get that tape back."
82,Bree,"well, the nurses at your office may start wondering why you're disappearing three times a week. tennis lessons are a plausible alibi."
2174,Bree,"well, somebody just bought her old house. maybe that triggered something."
125,Bree,"andrew, just because i chose not to share my marital problems with you does not give you the right to be rude."
3758,Bree,now? people are waiting.
286,Bree,"yes. gabrielle, did you, or did you not offer to sponsor her?"
628,Bree,"well, i'll tell you. my daughter is planning on giving you her virginity and i would consider it a personal favor if you wouldn't take it."
1381,Bree,"andrew, i made an appointment with a therapist for you, me, and danielle."
825,Bree,"come on, rex, you owe george some sort of a gesture."
2808,Bree,"oh, dear god. at least let me buy you some decent furniture."
3402,Bree,"orson, please. you're putting me in an impossible position."
3197,Bree,i can see that.
2801,Bree,you're moving out? but you can't afford an apartment.
2974,Bree,"well--if you have a different idea, i would love to hear that, too."
3095,Bree,those with roasted green beans as our side dishes. nice tight grouping. you are not rusty at all.
2846,Bree,so this is why you moved back to fairview?
1150,Bree,"well, he did something to upset me and i want him gone!"
1390,Bree,what'd you play?
61,Bree,how much do we really wanna know about our neighbours?
2722,Bree,"he's perfect. he's, um, he's all cleaned up now, if-- if you want to hold him."
1184,Bree,"hi, it's bree."
2215,Bree,"thank you. well, hello there! how pretty you look today! it's wonderful that you're up and about! you must be enjoying these colorful balloons!"
1010,Bree,"um, thank you, but i just couldn't."
3846,Bree,and you hope to earn it back through larceny?
1467,Bree,"yes,but the difference is most of those people were actually drunk when they were arrested.i was not."
1126,Bree,"yes, and i'm sure you will bury him with all the dignity of a dead hamster. no, i want rex released to me and i will make all the arrangements."
2987,Bree,"oh, it's dip. the caterer just said that--"
2659,Bree,buy a dictionary.
2497,Bree,and then what would happen to the baby?
318,Bree,"well, when did you decide this?"
118,Bree,open the door please.
91,Bree,"yes, it's just gonna be a casual night with the gang. we're going to eat, and tell fun stories about your mum. zach, are-are you okay?"
529,Bree,hardly? how about never!
2884,Bree,i'm just trying to stay out of the way of all those sparks that are flying.
1291,Bree,"uh, yes, i think so, mr. williams."
276,Bree,go ahead sweetheart. ask whatever you want.
18,Bree,"andrew, danielle, napkins?"
4064,Bree,"ooh. lynette, that's bad."
629,Bree,she said that you broke up with her because she refused to have sex.
2812,Bree,"i just don't want us to part on bad terms again, like we did two years ago."
1176,Bree,why should i feel guilty?
2614,Bree,excuse me?
1625,Bree,with what?you don't have any money.
1135,Bree,"i'm here, sweetheart, and i'm gonna take care of everything. but you knew that, didn't you? you've always known that you can count on me."
780,Bree,how you can sit there and be so casual is beyond me?
3334,Bree,"oh, well, i think the irises and the lilies could work together."
1953,Bree,"actually, no, we haven't had sex yet.we're waiting until we get married."
713,Bree,"stop it. honey, no matter what you say or do, i will always love you."
180,Bree,"zach,she would be very proud of you. what happened to your varnish?"
442,Bree,"not that it's any of your business, but, i have a date."
295,Bree,andrew--
2605,Bree,"no, it's for danielle. there you are. thank you."
4123,Bree,"george, i can't feel my legs."
2623,Bree,phyllis!
847,Bree,"okay, this is exactly what i was afraid of. george and i are just friends."
4124,Bree,"i don't think it was the wine, george. i think it was the antihistamines."
525,Bree,i don't think that would be wise.
207,Bree,"oh,sweetie, i was just coming over to talk to you. i'm so sorry, but something really important came up and i have to cancel."
3214,Bree,"oh, right. um, tomorrow for sure, then."
1016,Bree,it's right down this row.
1313,Bree,what?
3254,Bree,now?
2362,Bree,so what are you waiting for?
1274,Bree,"well, i know a store that carries maternity clothes with designer labels."
2781,Bree,"no, and i wish we had. if we did, he mightn't have turned out so--"
2613,Bree,"orson, i said be careful! i just think it's tacky to have a baby shower when it's not your first baby."
328,Bree,because i need to know that you're not a monster!
427,Bree,your adultery? no. i decided to keep that little gem all to myself.
2510,Bree,"will not be needed. as i said, i always bring dessert."
2213,Bree,"but, orson--"
2860,Bree,"edie, if you say that to lynette, so help me god, i will wring your neck."
774,Bree,"reverend, why don't you have a seat and i will get some refreshments."
1424,Bree,"oh, don't worry.i won't start garnishing your wages until you turn 18."
3788,Bree,"orson, i'm preparing a buffet for 200. i don't have time to explore my hypothetical career in the adult film industry."
625,Bree,why would you say that?
14,Bree,you'd rather i serve pork and beans?
3092,Bree,i know no such thing. now be quiet. i'm done talking to you.
3954,Bree,how can you just decide something like that?
3506,Bree,check and check.
315,Bree,are the lady fingers okay?
1846,Bree,"oh, that's okay.i can't sleep anyway."
2597,Bree,no. this early?
3696,Bree,gaby?
3826,Bree,"oh, that's them. wait till you meet tom. you'll be so glad you had that tape recorder. he's just bursting with ideas."
603,Bree,"well, if we take away his condoms, maybe--"
2205,Bree,"andrew, it's etiquette. nobody wants to read the truth at christmas."
3854,Bree,"i want you to explain to me why this insanity is still going on. when you stole that tape recorder, you said it was a onetime thing, an impulsive act of revenge."
576,Bree,huh?
964,Bree,"i am not kidding. i will go nondenominational so fast, it will make your head spin."
1844,Bree,"um,you can just--leave that there,and i'll, um--clean it up later."
2126,Bree,"orson's right. we need to support each other as a family. in fact, i say we all go for counseling."
3371,Bree,promise me you'll never leave our bed again.
3847,Bree,"i don't need to walk in your shoes, orson. what you did was embarrassing and childish, and it's never gonna happen again. understood?"
2807,Bree,"seriously, andrew, you don't even have a bed."
1443,Bree,"are you sure that you can't check on the applewhites?i mean,i just know that there's something there.and,you know,i have a sixth sense about people."
1862,Bree,and this is my son--the criminal. go on.
4087,Bree,"i had to. he found the storage unit. he wanted an explanation. i was in such a state of shock, i couldn't think of anything else to say."
2292,Bree,"oh, me, too. there's nothing more relaxing than an afternoon of finger food and girl talk."
1330,Bree,george! i have guests! what do you think you are doing?
2520,Bree,"it's true. everyone thought so. even me. oh, and that simple green salad--mache and baby arugula with duck confit and candied walnuts!"
270,Bree,"if andrew is angry about you moving out of the house, then perhaps he should shove your head into a locker!"
2669,Bree,"danielle, you should introduce yourself. these people are your new friends."
2103,Bree,does she know you killed your wife?
3552,Bree,when you were downstairs.
3719,Bree,here's my cookbook.
2001,Bree,"well, i don't pay attention to gossip."
4085,Bree,that will never happen.
2993,Bree,"oh, no one would expect you to do that in your condition. you know what? um, i could do it."
572,Bree,"well, it's just that i know that i don't please you sexually, so i was wondering if you really were looking forward to being with me."
296,Bree,"rex, you need to come home. something's happened, and we need you."
1276,Bree,"hi, honey."
1596,Bree,"your lawyer left a message on my machine.it seems we have a hearing in four weeks,and i wanna be ready."
3494,Bree,let's not dwell on it.
1704,Bree,no.i resented you because those were kick-ass peanut butter cookies.
3378,Bree,"well, it's just vulgar to discuss business at a party."
4080,Bree,"well, if you're referring to the financial settlement, i already told you, i don't care anymore."
726,Bree,hi. what's going on?
769,Bree,it'll be fine.
1929,Bree,danielle--i want you to get out of the house now.he's a killer.
175,Bree,paul?
2953,Bree,it just did.
2325,Bree,"actually,there is. i'd love it if you could join us for dinner this weekend. there are some friends that i'm just dying for you to meet."
1510,Bree,"well, i'm not sure,but i think maxine had a slave."
3192,Bree,"katherine, i'm blushing."
1066,Bree,i said no.
3361,Bree,"lynette, you're drunk."
4001,Bree,lovely. i'll make out a check.
3161,Bree,katherine? it's bree. we need to talk now!
1063,Bree,it's the quickest way to prove to the police that they're wrong.
257,Bree,"you are unhappy with our sex life because you're not getting something from me, but you're simply too afraid to ask."
2088,Bree,"yes. yes, we do."
1562,Bree,"oh,truthfully,i haven't been able to get my mind off it.what a scare,huh?"
2664,Bree,and a retirement village is fun?
448,Bree,"oh! come on in. george, you remember rex?"
693,Bree,"well, does it?"
280,Bree,wait a minute. what's all this about a modeling academy?
3640,Bree,"actually, you're right on time. we're just about to eat. shall we?"
424,Bree,you wouldn't be saying that if you knew what -
2831,Bree,really?
2964,Bree,"oh, gaby, i'm so glad you're here. i was just about to tell everyone to keep an eye out for their invitation to the founder's ball."
478,Bree,"yeah, and i would rather cut off my hand than hurt his feelings."
671,Bree,"gabrielle, is everything okay?"
587,Bree,"so, it's like we're in a little play."
2353,Bree,a house?
1254,Bree,i'll talk to dr. goldfine about it tomorrow.
405,Bree,he said that?
1352,Bree,why are you telling me this?
2345,Bree,i don't believe this. you called the police?
3907,Bree,i think a little more reverence for the dead is in order.
3563,Bree,"yes, my book is about food and families and how food brings families together when they make food. it's mothers teaching daughters how to cook. so i'm gonna cook pancakes with my daughter, only she's not here because she grew up and stole my baby. so--who wants to be my daughter?"
2869,Bree,"oh, for god sakes. tell him to put on his big boy pants and find another girl."
1174,Bree,"yes, it was the strangest thing. and so inconvenient. to be honest, i think we were about the make love for the first time."
2333,Bree,and orson didn't kill you.
1380,Bree,"andrew, it is inappropriate for you to have somebody over. you just got home."
1248,Bree,"no. dr. goldfine, my therapist."
575,Bree,"why not? rex, please tell me. let me prove to you how much i love you."
1247,Bree,and i'm not the only one who thinks that. other people have said the same thing.
2925,Bree,"oh, so you're--coming to bible study."
808,Bree,i don't remember that.
3706,Bree,"i want a new stove, rex, and if i need to get a job to pay for it, so be it."
2629,Bree,"it's a surprise party, you daft woman! what makes you think i had a hand in the guest list?"
434,Bree,"listen, i have a prescription here for rex. i don't know if you heard, but he had a heart attack."
813,Bree,"george, as it turns out i won't be able to go with you to the bonsai expo."
3751,Bree,lynette. i understand you and your fellow chefs will be serving my four cheese pizza tonight.
1133,Bree,"thank you. ah, the hearse is right outside, so if you'll just follow me."
993,Bree,excuse me?
2187,Bree,"sorry, no. turns out he has an explanation for the police report."
2940,Bree,psst! not you. lynette.
3160,Bree,"no, i did a bang-up job. katherine bailed on me and left town last night."
4033,Bree,that is none of your business.
3318,Bree,what kind of meeting is it?
404,Bree,"well, that depends. are you having an affair with my husband?"
2670,Bree,"well, actually, we checked into the curriculum, and it's very strong, but no matter. you're be happier here."
1726,Bree,"uh,yeah,they wrote you a letter.it seems they came across some personal items of yours that, um,upset them."
2549,Bree,"i'm getting good at props. no,no."
3774,Bree,thank you for having us over. we are so honored to be the first guests in your new home.
3063,Bree,i'm bree hodge.
2439,Bree,"oh, i didn't."
3515,Bree,"now, um, may i pour you some more tea?"
2823,Bree,last week. i was afraid that mike might go to orson for pills.
2507,Bree,what about her?
1961,Bree,hum.it will be better this way.now can i get you some more ice cream?
2566,Bree,"clearly, it would be time well spent."
1837,Bree,was it you? or you?!who was it?
2208,Bree,"oh,don't be silly.i'm sending one to the man who reads our gas meter.i can certainly send one to your mother."
973,Bree,give me your tie.
187,Bree,"most of my family went to the hospital, but i stayed home because i was so young.when i looked out the window i saw all my mother's blood on the street and nobody was doing anything about it. so i got a hose and i washed it off. and once it was clean, i felt so much better."
3943,Bree,"lord, lynette. you nearly gave me a heart attack."
2713,Bree,not on the couch. i just had it reupholstered.
1774,Bree,"yes.betty,i am serious.either you do something,or i will."
2121,Bree,of course. we'll get her all the help she needs.
2079,Bree,"this is a nightmare, an absolute nightmare."
1850,Bree,"because, um, i can't sleep just yet."
3612,Bree,"yes. which reminds me, that needs to be back by 3:00.could you?"
3206,Bree,"yes, it is."
372,Bree,the same thing you just did to every memory i have of our marriage.
3369,Bree,"for god sakes, lynette, stop calling me a success. there's nothing successful about me. my friends think i'm gonna drop them, my partner resents me, and my husband--has moved into the guest bedroom. everything i gain comes at some horrible price, and i'm starting to wonder if any of it's even worth it."
2746,Bree,what's that supposed to mean? you don't trust me?
273,Bree,you went to an attorney?
2955,Bree,"hey, lynette."
1833,Bree,"sweetheart,this is your special day.all of your candless should be lit.it'll just take me two seconds."
2404,Bree,"no, dear, you were dead to the waist."
2373,Bree,"oh, please. orson made it perfectly clear we don't want you here."
239,Bree,"of course, that's fine. shall i include the meal?"
3102,Bree,"come on. you have to do something. i mean, that name is practically abusive."
53,Bree,"uh, yeah, i'm sure."
2533,Bree,"no. no, i am not upset. i'm just confused as to why you seem so determined to get off on the wrong foot. first you bring a pie to lynette's, when i clearly assigned you the salad--"
1750,Bree,"it's just awful, isn't it?i mean, you never know what people are doing behind your back.would you like some milk with your cookies?"
449,Bree,"oh, we are, emotionally. physically, he just lives here because his mistress refuses to care for him. would you like a drink?"
901,Bree,"forcing me to share in your depraved pasttime wasn't bad enough, you had to share my humiliation with your co-workers?"
523,Bree,were you with a woman?
3488,Bree,"oh, dear god. i can't look. really, andrew."
4052,Bree,in the ballpark.
2428,Bree,"yes, and i intend to go to the police."
1367,Bree,"''i don't understand. i mean what would george be doing with a life-size doll?oh,dear lord.''"
300,Bree,"well, everybody should, uh, go wash up. we're having pancakes for breakfast."
3061,Bree,"what were you thinking, edie? we're supposed to be friends."
3368,Bree,but that doesn't mean i look down on you.
3459,Bree,"well, then i suggest you return your purchase. do you have a receipt?"
3865,Bree,that's not yours?
550,Bree,"why, what's wrong?"
1446,Bree,"detective barton,is this some sort of high school ploy to get me back to your place?"
2815,Bree,and some of us gave you very expensive wedding gifts.
3358,Bree,"oh, honey. everybody's asking about you. i want you to be here. it's my big day."
3822,Bree,see a perfectly innocent--bald-faced lie.
3132,Bree,hey. what's going on?
3700,Bree,i'm sorry if the frittata is a bit dry.
969,Bree,i do want you to come to the funeral.
503,Bree,"okay. now when you're firing a semi-automatic, you want the web of your hand all the way up against the edge of the back strap."
4078,Bree,excuse me?
1217,Bree,"honey, you need to put that in a frame or something."
451,Bree,"i'm going to go put these in water. george, why don't you have a seat, and i'll be right back."
929,Bree,thanks.
3620,Bree,"wait, wait, wait. this is not how we decide family get-togethers."
3145,Bree,"lynette, i wish i had time to be more tactful, but i don't. your swan is pathetic, and i'm firing you from napkin duty."
4061,Bree,"yes, and i'll be single again, and i can concentrate on my business, maybe do some traveling."
1146,Bree,thank you.
3834,Bree,would anyone care for something sweet?
222,Bree,"oh no, i don't worry about john. both he and danielle are in the abstinence club."
51,Bree,"oh. well, i wish he had called me."
1936,Bree,orson.
196,Bree,nothing.that's it. just that mary alice killed herself because of something he had done.
4100,Bree,don't be glib. did you hire someone to attack orson?
4048,Bree,"and i'm thinking i may have acted rashly. i mean, every marriage has its rough patches. orson loves me, and deep down, he's a good man. if i stick with this, maybe we can make it work. are you even listening to me?"
5,Bree,"oh yes, page one of the philanderer's handbook."
3634,Bree,hi! what have you two been up to?
2891,Bree,"well, say no more. one slice coming right up."
2146,Bree,he dumped you?
2209,Bree,"well, all the more reason to send her one. let the nurses know that she has family at home who loves her--and who could drop by at any minute and slap them with a lawsuit."
1017,Bree,so have you given any thought to when you might be ending your visit? what?
1021,Bree,"well, i got that, but why? why would they do that?"
2535,Bree,just--give me the recipe!
2095,Bree,what is?
955,Bree,"phyllis, these are all things that happened to rex before he went to college."
2426,Bree,"no, no. come in."
2257,Bree,and what if you weren't? what if she had broken something and she was lying here for hours? you are coming home with us.
3869,Bree,orson? orson! orson! orson! orson! no!
1536,Bree,"caleb and i had, uh,a very lovely chat. yes."
1221,Bree,"okay, i'm starting to get the feeling that we are not going to a yard sale."
2190,Bree,it means you should stop worrying about my marriage and start worrying about your own.
3219,Bree,"oh, gaby, it's just one party. i'll save you some cake."
2633,Bree,where is she going?
817,Bree,ginger? the stock girl?
3509,Bree,you must be sandra. what a sharp outfit. and look at that hair--so thick and lustrous.
77,Bree,so how many will i be cooking for?
165,Bree,hi.
3636,Bree,i'm sure they could. it's too bad your practice is all the way down here.
2769,Bree,addicts are experts at deception.
2206,Bree,"honey, would you put on another cd? something with sleigh bells."
2122,Bree,andrew!
4009,Bree,invite evan mayer to your sleepover.
3789,Bree,coco saugatuck. happy now?
3500,Bree,"fair enough. but just be careful, i mean, this is very complicated. i'd hate to see it end badly."
1660,Bree,"i could not ask for anything more.thanks.see you around,i hope."
450,Bree,"rex, say hello to george!"
2435,Bree,alma?
2263,Bree,is that alcohol? where did you get that?
411,Bree,hey.
3225,Bree,"hi, linda."
514,Bree,and-?
3464,Bree,"oh. ""the new christian reader"" just published an advance review of my cookbook. listen! ""mrs. van de kamp's colorful stories of her upbringing show her upstanding values, but her recipes are sinfully delicious."" they gave me four halos!"
2839,Bree,"hi, katherine. could i borrow adam for a second? i have a--situation on my hands."
3230,Bree,orson! did you get my message about linda flanagan?
3351,Bree,"honey, i don't snore."
3567,Bree,"oh, he's not apprehensive. he's terrified. and i don't care, because he owes me one--a big one. don't you, darling?"
3241,Bree,what are you doing here? you were disinvited.
3133,Bree,"it's tomorrow! a hundred gay men are descending on this street, and they're expecting a fabulous party."
732,Bree,"well, art is subjective."
2252,Bree,of course she likes it. there's a 24-hour liquor store across the street.
842,Bree,i um. i have to talk to edie.
967,Bree,"it's true rex and i did not have the perfect marriage, but for eighteen years i tried my very best, and for that i am entitled to your respect."
147,Bree,so what's your strategy? are you just never going to speak to me again?
3142,Bree,don't you dare throw your calligraphy skills in my face when you know i'm at a low point. now go! and stop following me.
1072,Bree,"george, you're a very special friend, you are, but rex hasn't been dead four weeks so i think kissing on the lips is-"
1888,Bree,"um, but we could come back later."
4118,Bree,"andrew, honey, hurry up. dinner's ready."
3528,Bree,goodness.
59,Bree,"that is not true, rex."
1997,Bree,and what mistake would that be?
3412,Bree,"no, it doesn't. and besides, i gave you the day off. now go home."
156,Bree,"well, my father was a prosecutor and he always said that the simplest explanation was usually the right one."
1937,Bree,how sweet and-- unexpected.do you wanna come in?
2612,Bree,"uh, it's a lovely thought, but i really don't want a baby shower."
3908,Bree,wow. it sounds like she gave you just what you needed. good for edie.
1322,Bree,"george, stop it."
1799,Bree,consider me a cheerleader for anything that expedites me getting you out from under my roof.
29,Bree,these need water.
90,Bree,"oh. well, i'm sorry it's such late notice, but well, we weren't sure whether you and your father were ready for any kind of social engagement yet. but, well, we're, we're sort of throwing it in your mother's honour."
669,Bree,"i will scream about your cruelty. then i will scream about your infidelity. and then, just to make sure it really hurts, i will scream about your distasteful sexual habits. you want to know what true humiliation is, you just take one step."
961,Bree,you are no longer invited to the funeral.
3208,Bree,"thank you, dear. orson, what do you think?"
3089,Bree,"really? so i just happen to run into you at the dry cleaner, the greengrocer,the post office?"
1761,Bree,"yes,i'm aware of that."
3849,Bree,"oh, dear. what happened?"
2248,Bree,"oh, look, a highly motivated cockroach."
3922,Bree,it isn't that kind of visit.
2094,Bree,oh?
1649,Bree,so how are you doing?
2983,Bree,she's not my boss!
1556,Bree,porter! preston!this isn't funny!
3676,Bree,"well, for all i know, telling orson his steak tastes like charcoal might be deballing him."
189,Bree,"yes,you're probably right."
3433,Bree,is he gay? ugh! i knew he had too much product in his hair.
359,Bree,really?
2819,Bree,and everything will be just the way it was.
3436,Bree,"my god, orson. what kind of criminal is he? a killer or a rapist?"
190,Bree,ooooh.
2148,Bree,yes. i wonder where she gets it.
856,Bree,"no, not at all. i think that we should talk about it. in fact i think maybe we don't talk enough."
1547,Bree,"look,for the record,i had an allergic reactionto my antihistamine medication,so i would appreciate just a little bit of sympathy."
4051,Bree,i doubt that.
2790,Bree,"apparently, ""not to pry"" wasn't necessary."
1529,Bree,downstairs?
6,Bree,"this is half the reason i joined the nra. well, when rex started going to those medical conferences, i wanted at the back of his mind that he had a loving wife at home, with a loaded smith and wesson."
1393,Bree,"not exactly, anyway."
2255,Bree,is anything broken?
1951,Bree,orson and i are engaged.
2732,Bree,i thought you liked debbie and lou.
2340,Bree,"amazing, isn't it, where some people's minds will go?"
644,Bree,"no, i can't."
3294,Bree,"orson, i'm truly sorry. it's just, seeing--all these mistakes that she's making with benjamin, it's just so hard for me."
319,Bree,i see.
2447,Bree,"well, um, while we were in switzerland, she ran across this boarding school, and she fell in love with it and just insisted that we let her spend a year abroad."
3692,Bree,"what does that mean, ""an entrance""?"
3422,Bree,"my, that's a nice little terrace. we, we will throw you a party so special that you'll want us to cater your anniversary, too."
1548,Bree,"for god sakes,it was an honest mistake.i thought i could have just a little bit of wine with dinner,but, apparently,my body couldn't handle it.fine!if it makes everybody happy,i will just suffer through my sneezing fits and my hives on my own."
2111,Bree,"thank you, dear. danielle, you haven't touched your dinner."
183,Bree,"i'm serving it this year for christmas. i like to try out new recipes before the actual holiday. that way, if the cook book has gotten it wrong, i can fix it."
2007,Bree,i don't have time for this. i'm getting married now.
1515,Bree,"when it comes to betty applewhite,i know what i'm doing,and you two are just gonna have to trust me.and if you can't do that,then perhaps i've overestimated the depth of our friendship.now,if you'll excuse me--"
3516,Bree,why were you talking to that woman?
602,Bree,"well, then the least we can do is go search his room and if we find any more of these, we'll confiscate them."
795,Bree,the doctor upped his dosage twice and it's still not helping.
566,Bree,"we're, um, wasps, doctor goldfine. not acknowledging the elephant in the room is what we do best."
904,Bree,it doesn't matter.
4094,Bree,are you all right? what happened to your shirt?
373,Bree,why did carlos have to back out?
3894,Bree,"mr. dinsmore, would you mind if i speak to my husband for a moment?"
1012,Bree,and i appreciate that.
2459,Bree,"look, if you're gonna start complaining, i'm going to hang up."
4047,Bree,i can't believe you went to all that trouble.
2909,Bree,"orson, i don't want to be late."
2569,Bree,we should help mike with the food.
3687,Bree,"alex-- i'm gonna tell you something i haven't told anybody-- not orson, not andrew, just you. i know that i've changed since my business took off, but i didn't want to admit it. i've watched myself become selfish, impatient, rude. i was never the type to suffer fools gladly, but now i seem to find fools everywhere. and i don't want to be that way. i need someone who isn't afraid to speak out, to call me out when i cross those lines, and i would love it if you would be that person."
1263,Bree,motherhood.
3784,Bree,andrew moved into a new home. i simply gave him a cost of living increase.
2854,Bree,"she said that she and adam were lovers and she could prove it because he had a tattoo, and--"
1793,Bree,"oh,my god,are you okay?"
1272,Bree,"well, maybe susan, lynette, and i have had a good influence on you."
706,Bree,come along.
1807,Bree,i can't be around you anymore.i'm just not strong enough.
3384,Bree,"uh, yes. he's going to read a lot of classic books, maybe study a language."
339,Bree,you put a woman into a coma.surely that arouses some kind of emotion.
800,Bree,"it's true that we dated during the separation, but george and i are just friends now, aren't we?"
662,Bree,"rex, this might sound silly, but are people staring at us?"
3586,Bree,"all right then, alex. oh, look at you two, sitting so far apart. scootch over."
2308,Bree,so why couldn't you tell me this?
2109,Bree,"oh, gus, i don't plan anything unpleasant. i'm simply going to inform mr. faladi what repercussions he faces if he continues this relationship and trust him to see reason."
2880,Bree,walter recently split up with his life partner todd. they were gay.
1421,Bree,my son is trying to blackmail me.and i want you to stop the little sobdo you think you could do that?
340,Bree,"so, why isn't mrs. huber here?"
2030,Bree,oh my god.
1477,Bree,"danielle, question?is there a black man hiding under your bed?"
3798,Bree,"yes, orson, we're all aware of how you got the job."
4116,Bree,andrew.
199,Bree,"girls,you don't understand. this poor kid is scared out of his mind."
1088,Bree,part of the reason i'm having him over is so that you can get to know him.
3269,Bree,would it be more acceptable if i shopped for a suicidal pork loin?
2448,Bree,"well, i am gonna call her tonight and have a little talk with her about common courtesy, and i'm sure that you will get an e-mail first thing tomorrow morning. well, we should go. i've got to get that bracelet to gaby before the wedding."
3098,Bree,"you really want to be effective? try hollow points. these rounds you've got punch straight though, but a hollow point blooms on impact, cuts the body to shreds from the inside."
232,Bree,"oh, dear."
877,Bree,what is that supposed to mean?
1202,Bree,"well, i'm not gonna get another rash just by holding your hand."
1919,Bree,do you?
1122,Bree,stop it!
1611,Bree,now why would you say that?
492,Bree,this is a 9-mm luger po8!
1930,Bree,"danielle!i'm serious, go."
1121,Bree,andrew! andrew!
4073,Bree,"there's no point. so you should get a piece of paper, start to make a list of what it is you wish to take with you."
2464,Bree,"yes,but the good news is she's gonna live."
994,Bree,"i am not cold. i just, well, i don't like public displays of emotion."
2239,Bree,why? what could she possibly have done to make you hate her so much?
2634,Bree,and--and you told her?!
652,Bree,i have some money that i've been putting aside for emergencies. it can be all yours if you just--
194,Bree,"zach,i won't tell your father."
3336,Bree,"orson, you really don't wanna work with me. i mean, you only see me at home. but at work, when the pressure's on, i can be a bit of a handful. katherine's seen how i get."
3352,Bree,"oh, for heaven sakes, come back to bed."
3526,Bree,wonderful. the house was too quiet without him.
992,Bree,thank you.
903,Bree,you're a liar.
2915,Bree,i would love that. we're--we're leaving right now. you can follow us.
3559,Bree,"enough coffee. it's not working, anyway. it must be decaf."
3184,Bree,really? what?
58,Bree,good.
3611,Bree,yes.
3170,Bree,"well, that's no surprise. my pies are always perfect."
432,Bree,"hello, george."
3986,Bree,i-i may have overstated things when i described my husband as a decent man. he actually has a wide variety of psychological problems.
862,Bree,"okay, okay, i'll be good."
3910,Bree,"you know, edie used to live around here when she moved away from wisteria lane."
3678,Bree,i mean i bought you a house. you'd think you'd show me a little respect.
3264,Bree,"yes, i'm aware of that. i picked it. i'm just concerned people might view it as a sign of, um, disrespect."
2491,Bree,yes.
3394,Bree,and how is word going to spread?
1690,Bree,that's your solution?
1902,Bree,"they also get pregnant and become drug addicts, and that color hair is the gateway.would you please, uh, add that to our bill?"
1177,Bree,"dr. goldfine, rex is dead. you can't cheat on a corpse."
3866,Bree,"uh, i don't know. but, you know, there it is."
163,Bree,"well,i had hoped someday to get my grandchildren into barcliff. but i suppose that doesn't matter to you, does it?"
1194,Bree,"please. i mean, clearly, you didn't come here to shop."
3955,Bree,do you really mean that?
2067,Bree,mr. faladi.
2005,Bree,"that was close. the florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet. but not to worry, crisis averted."
1739,Bree,edie!
351,Bree,"oh lord, what do you want me to do?"
304,Bree,don't you think that's a little bit extreme?
1090,Bree,"you know, i haven't even thought about it."
2554,Bree,"it does sound fun, but i don't think my doctor's taking on any new patients."
3973,Bree,wonderful.
4043,Bree,wow.
60,Bree,"yes, well, i feel badly about that."
287,Bree,"it's in new york, for god's sakes, why on earth would you suggest that?"
2917,Bree,presbyterian.
1691,Bree,"um,i'm sorry,dad,but i think my relationship with andrew is just a bit more complicated than--"
1648,Bree,so-- how long has it been since you--
1641,Bree,really?because i don't.
2329,Bree,good. i'll see you at eight o'clock.
3041,Bree,"yes, i can smell the thinking on your breath. are you insane, driving in this condition?"
3356,Bree,where are you? it's after 2:00.
1314,Bree,"well, i'm sorry, but i'm not going to."
591,Bree,what's the matter with boise?
3946,Bree,"this was a wonderful idea, karen."
2089,Bree,"i know how painful this must be for you. it isn't easy for me either, considering andrew's role in it."
1453,Bree,"a sobriety test? i'm not taking any sobriety--test.this behavior stems from the hurt feelings of a man with very low self-esteem.the world is a big place,and i'm sure there is a woman out there somewhere who'll respond to your macho posturing."
557,Bree,rex and i are hosting a dinner party for ten next week. we're using our best china and serving duck.
4037,Bree,"you wanna be a neanderthal, karl? that's your choice. i prefer to behave with class and dignity. now may we please finish robbing my home?"
1108,Bree,"thank you, george, for being so understanding."
788,Bree,"andrew, please just go and talk to reverend sykes."
3236,Bree,and because it was the right thing to do. i just didn't know then that i would be a public figure someday. but i am. i have a name now.
2179,Bree,"then again, he probably wants some time to unpack."
2946,Bree,"lynette, please. can't we just go outside and talk for a moment?"
1838,Bree,you!
1339,Bree,"i just hope you don't expect too much from this relationship. i mean aside from dna, you might find that you don't have that much in common."
2397,Bree,"andrew, i need you to come over here right away--and, um--bring the wheelbarrow."
267,Bree,this was the johnson boy?
3350,Bree,me? snoring?
2259,Bree,"it's just not right. your mother skipped lunch, too."
1917,Bree,"well, i'm glad that you're having fun."
1699,Bree,really?and whose idea was that?
2537,Bree,"i was doing a little baking, and i was wondering if i could borrow something."
1740,Bree,"yeah! you know, they're always coming up with these excuses to justify being a home-wrecker."
4098,Bree,what?
2585,Bree,i can't wait that long. i have to be with her.
635,Bree,"i know my daughter. she's very determined, and unless you're really firm with her, she's going to continue to think that there's hope."
614,Bree,"as a matter of fact it does, and just so we're clear, if you get lisa pregnant, you will marry her."
2501,Bree,we're your friends. why would you shut us out?
1520,Bree,"is that what you really think, danielle?i should go to mrs. applewhite, be nice,and then she'll hand over all her secrets?"
3240,Bree,gaby?
3654,Bree,"oh, don't worry about us. jackson is so great. you are making the right choice."
360,Bree,"no, i don't."
1057,Bree,no.
2553,Bree,"you know, my o.b. is all the way across town. you just do not want to drive that far."
2712,Bree,"okay, everybody, in the house now."
3251,Bree,"orson, you're still up. oh, i wish you could've been there. linda flanagan loved my food. she said i was ""god's gift to the table"" and that i could quote her on the book jacket. are you all right?"
3306,Bree,"isn't this nice? they're running it next month in ""woman's day."""
3121,Bree,they're a little late getting started.
2639,Bree,you wouldn't. think of danielle!
3690,Bree,"oh, i think it's saturday."
438,Bree,"yes, i think it would be fun."
1167,Bree,"no, no, no, it wasn't your kiss. i felt something weird on my neck."
3134,Bree,"okay. well, what's going on?"
2267,Bree,"okay, look, i know you're upset, but don't blame orson. it's not his fault."
1402,Bree,"to be honest, i don't think i would've liked it, either."
2976,Bree,"well, they're certainly--assertive. my only fear is--"
208,Bree,"we will do it again. we'll have our impromptu holiday dinner, i promise. bye."
4062,Bree,"sadly, karl, i always know what you are saying."
3889,Bree,"that's sweet, but i've decided to focus on other pursuits at the moment."
2667,Bree,"seriously, we hadn't realized you'd matured enough to take on the burden of motherhood all by yourself."
2330,Bree,"oh, susan, you know, i feel exactly--"
1014,Bree,really?
2383,Bree,what's a garden without a snake?
509,Bree,"hey. hi, george. i'm so sorry you lost your toe. the doctor said it's your middle one so your balance shouldn't be affected. i mean, this really won't change your life one little bit. please say something."
2153,Bree,that sounds lovely.
1796,Bree,"andrew?honey,where are you?i got your message.what's the emergency?andrew?andrew?"
2551,Bree,i thought you were using dr. mayfair.
3939,Bree,"a couple of days ago. we've been trying to get in touch with your dad, but he's still out of the country."
1138,Bree,"well, i know, but rex died in his care. of course he'd like to blame someone else."
496,Bree,the memory of this night will stay with you forever.
3818,Bree,"i tell you what. i will invite bruce over for dinner, you and tom can join us, and we'll turn it into a low pressure job interview."
1809,Bree,i think it's gonna be a kick having susan and julie stay with us.it'll be like living in a sorority.we'll stay up late and we'll gossip and make s'mores.doesn't that sound like fun?
440,Bree,i'm keeping my eyes on the horizon. please tell me if i'm about to step on a body part.
1993,Bree,"yeah, don't you think it will be gorgeous with my coloring?"
3491,Bree,"hello, katherine. um, i thought you might want this videota--from our surveillance camera."
1893,Bree,because my daughter is in danger.
981,Bree,"well, mr. pashmutti -"
899,Bree,you really want to know?
1873,Bree,and seriously-- i am not like these other people.
3452,Bree,"good. well, now that that's settled--let's make some pies."
1895,Bree,i can tell by your tone that you don't believe me.
3950,Bree,do you at least know why he steals?
301,Bree,"it has to be, i don't want gabrielle and carlos coming home to this ugly reminder in front of their house."
1305,Bree,"fluoxetine, one hundred milligrams. risperidone, two fifty milli-- i'm sorry. what is this?"
2552,Bree,but you don't mind orson being your dentist.
4007,Bree,"well, hello there, m.j. i was baking this morning, and like an idiot, i made too many macaroons. would you be willing to take one? i would hate to see them go to waste."
692,Bree,you talk to him all you want. i'm gonna check out the place with the electrified fence.
2516,Bree,"well, clearly no tips are needed. as my friends said, ""best pie ever made."""
639,Bree,"what's wrong, rex? didn't you enjoy your golf game with dr. wallace?"
4029,Bree,"oh, god, no. that's orson's dental innovator of the year award. i've always hated that thing. oh, here."
336,Bree,"you've got four kids. that's a lot of stress. honey, you need some help."
3002,Bree,"i misunderstood the situation, that's all. can we just leave it at that?"
1815,Bree,name it. it's yours.
3681,Bree,orson burnt the steaks.
2461,Bree,"look, i am gonna say this one last time. you are gonna stay put until that baby is born. now don't forget, we're driving up this weekend, and i am bringing your favorite--lemon squares, and--"
2841,Bree,i saw her weeping. i wanted to help.
2730,Bree,"i'd start saving your pennies. bonny briar's up to $10,000 a year."
3066,Bree,may i help you?
3093,Bree,and also with you. do not give this man peace.
563,Bree,"once, and you should've seen the look in his eyes. he was terrified that i'll figure it out. you know what it is, don't you?"
3518,Bree,i cannot let this happen. i have to find her.
3131,Bree,hi! we were just talking about you.
4086,Bree,"orson, please don't do this. i don't love you."
459,Bree,"well, we're just, um, talking. mr. williams took me out to dinner."
2218,Bree,"well, how can he feel that way? you're his mother."
225,Bree,connected?
2863,Bree,"hey, susan, orson likes to sleep with the window open. do you mind if we rearrange the furniture?"
1591,Bree,and what might that be?
2113,Bree,when you start acting like an adult.
1985,Bree,"orson, what is she talking about?"
1419,Bree,"hi, karl. oh!oh, um, quick question--when someone discusses a sensitive situation with a lawyer such as yourself,when does attorney/client confidentiality kick in?"
3578,Bree,of course i have.
710,Bree,"hopefully, you won't have to be there for more than a few weeks."
2924,Bree,"wow, you bought a bible."
2757,Bree,"yes, bree hodge--born rabinowitz."
4053,Bree,"and do you say that to every woman, too?"
504,Bree,"uh, i'm not wearing perfume."
2683,Bree,"uh, no, my daughter is in switzerland, at boarding school."
2100,Bree,why?
2161,Bree,"that is ridiculous.orson did not kill alma.and besides,carolyn just apologized to me for that yesterday."
1205,Bree,"well, you're the pharmacist. if you think it's okay--"
1097,Bree,"okay, time for cobbler. sorry, one of the dessert plates doesn't match. i tried to replace it but it's spode florence. it's a rare pattern. belonged to my grandmother, but hopefully, once you taste the dessert, you'll forget all about it."
2690,Bree,"well, you certainly don't seem happy here, and i thought maybe you were missing the nuns and the other girls."
2065,Bree,"well, that would certainly spare the family some embarrassment. why not throw in a killing spree, too?"
2985,Bree,about what?
316,Bree,we just want you to know how much we care.
1913,Bree,i beg your pardon?
2836,Bree,"be that as it may, i really think you should go now."
3814,Bree,how's tom holding up?
251,Bree,i'm repairing a chipped mug.
247,Bree,then perhaps you shouldn't say anything.
867,Bree,"come on, take your best -"
2386,Bree,excuse me?
2261,Bree,"oh, no, i'd rather do it myself. i wanna talk to her."
348,Bree,it's just a fact. i'm his mother. he lived inside of me.
2621,Bree,"uh, guys--what did i tell you?"
3273,Bree,"so instead of sending him to a proper school, you're gonna give him the benefit of your straight ""c"" average?"
3373,Bree,who?
920,Bree,thank you.
4013,Bree,"thank you. oh, thank you, sweetheart."
1451,Bree,"oh,you can't be serious."
3321,Bree,i don't understand. you said the job was going so well.
676,Bree,that is obviously different.
1382,Bree,"this pain that you're feeling is completely natural, but it's not gonna go away until you deal with it. andrew, i want us to heal. i want us to be a family again."
2357,Bree,"well, are you aware of its history? the previous owner was harboring a murderer."
776,Bree,"well, that's just too bad because this needs to be discussed."
477,Bree,sorry i can't invite you in for coffee.
1265,Bree,"well, i'm just smiling because i think a few months from now you are gonna come to me and tell me how madly in love you are with your new little baby, and i'm gonna have to resist the urge to say 'i told you so.'"
1329,Bree,if you'll excuse me for just one minute.
3535,Bree,good point. snoring is too mild a word for what you're doing. imagine a terrified elephant summoning his herd.
2615,Bree,i really don't want a shower.
2036,Bree,fine!
592,Bree,hmm. how about palestine?
2716,Bree,how many rum punches did you have?
1286,Bree,"yes, we did. now, when the time comes to go public with our relationship, i need you to discuss it with me first. i'm the bride, after all. it's only appropriate."
3533,Bree,"yes, it is. sit down. we need to talk."
3885,Bree,all the while thinking i had your support.
2387,Bree,are those shoes suede?
353,Bree,lynette--
4063,Bree,"thanks, karl. i'm not even divorced yet, and once i am, i don't think you'd be my first choice as a matchmaker."
1694,Bree,"i slapped him once,and he deserved it."
746,Bree,if you will excuse me.
3575,Bree,you're living with the man? since when?
3127,Bree,"no, that's all right. let him rest. but please take excellent care of him. he's a good man."
740,Bree,"oh no, we had a wonderful time. although i think porter had a little less fun. okay, i'll bet."
2186,Bree,"all right, i accept your explanation. i just wish there were fewer things for you to explain. by the way, to remove a red wine stain, you sprinkle salt to absorb it."
511,Bree,"i'm still married to rex. i mean, we're not even legally separated yet."
2543,Bree,another one? it's time for an anonymous letter.
1396,Bree,get over here.now.
4088,Bree,"you have no idea. now he's saying if i try to divorce him, he can go to the police and report me."
1674,Bree,come on?where are we going?
203,Bree,oh! you are going to love it! it has quite a kick..
2874,Bree,"you're funny. now i need you to be honest about this recipe. it's a dry run for a small dinner party i'm having tomorrow night. again, if you don't mind."
3859,Bree,"ah, you're a lifesaver!"
2159,Bree,no! i have no idea. what?
3126,Bree,i'm his wife.
2454,Bree,did you find him?
773,Bree,"andrew, you remember reverend sykes, don't you?"
2973,Bree,"oh, no, thank you. we have so much ground to cover. now let's move on to the flowers. uh, last year, we went with a cascade of pink and white roses. there it is."
3959,Bree,"well, save it for those karaoke parties at bob and lee's. i am not amused."
347,Bree,"well, that's because you just don't love him as much as i do!"
235,Bree,dr. goldfine.
775,Bree,would you like some water? i have flat or bubbly.
943,Bree,you're about to find out.
593,Bree,"so i guess we should, uh, get started. what do you want me to do?"
3326,Bree,looks like somebody's job interview went well.
1253,Bree,really?
1412,Bree,andrew--i want you downstair-- now.
2905,Bree,we brought you muffins.
2624,Bree,i have been awful. i wouldn't blame you if you stormed out right now.
1572,Bree,oh. good for you.did lynette mention the little tiff we had?
2885,Bree,"yes, but he's also-- he's got a great sense of--okay, do you know how hard it is to get a good contractor?"
1358,Bree,''thank you very much.''
2434,Bree,your mother--she tried to kill me.
3310,Bree,why?
2048,Bree,"uh, excuse me. i'm looking for my son. have you seen him? have you seen him?"
1603,Bree,"you know,the opposite of love isn't hate.it's indifference.and if you hate me,that means you still care,and we're still connected,and i still have a chance to set you right."
2254,Bree,are you all right?
3780,Bree,"well, the chamber of commerce just called. they've added 40 people to their guest list."
489,Bree,"you know, your lunch hour is almost up. we should probably be getting you back to the pharmacy."
1631,Bree,you can't be serious.
1489,Bree,"well, my fear is that if we keep them apart,they'll try that much harder to be together.i mean, you know how teenagers can be,and, well, a lot can happen in a couple of weeks."
4019,Bree,"absolutely not. i am all up for a little creative accounting and some secret bank accounts, but hiring some thug to stage a break-in?"
1428,Bree,do we even know who he is?
3492,Bree,"yes, in the, uh, test kitchen."
1116,Bree,"george, it's my pattern. where did you find it?"
3896,Bree,"well, i have a new idea. i'd like to wait."
2093,Bree,"yes, absolutely."
764,Bree,"our son has just told us that he might be gay. there are two hundred other boys in this kamp. now i could explain to you what might happen if we left him here, but i'm a lady and i don't use that kind of language."
3718,Bree,wait. i wanted to fix something for eli for a change.
977,Bree,""" hyllis, we've only been waiting here for two minutes."" \"
2806,Bree,"thank you. you know, i'd make it for every day if you'd move back home."
1288,Bree,it's in my purse.
3562,Bree,thank you for having me to your lovely home.
3702,Bree,"if you would just take on a few more patients, we could afford it."
838,Bree,"i can't go on a trip with you, george."
2384,Bree,thanks for the heads-up. now off you go.
1439,Bree,"we have these,um,new neighbors--the applewhites.it's a mother and her son. they just moved here from chicago.and they seem very nice.but there's--there's something about them that's--off.they're--odd."
3335,Bree,"not a good time, orson."
1777,Bree,#name?
536,Bree,rex. time to take your medicine.
2347,Bree,"right, just like you knew she was dead."
2617,Bree,"oh, dear god."
3603,Bree,"no, no, no. this can't possibly be true. the man is a doctor. are you sure?"
2820,Bree,here. i brought you a few things in case there is a tornado.
4081,Bree,jail?
1635,Bree,i would rather not discuss it right now.
1658,Bree,"yes,and his lawyer is taking depositions now to see if i am a fit parent.and considering that mishap that i had with your kids,i,uh,i imagine he'll be anxious to talk to you."
1008,Bree,what?
2708,Bree,"do not test me, young lady, or i will drag you out of here myself."
913,Bree,i never leave the house with an unmade bed. you know that.
2696,Bree,ugh! i hate possums.
677,Bree,"well, then, good luck on your remodel."
149,Bree,i shouldn't have lied to you about your father. you and your sister are old enough to handle the truth and i'm sorry.
228,Bree,"oh. so she would be in the room with us, while we make love?"
1733,Bree,"i'm sorry, peter,but, uh, who is this?"
679,Bree,"well, um, i've been doing some thinking. rex and i have been members of the fairview country club for years, and, well, lately, it seems to have lost some of its exclusivity, and so i've decided not to renew our membership. i'd rather see the money go to someone i care about."
1602,Bree,i'm sorry.i didn't quite catch that.
3418,Bree,"oh! yes, of course. uh, i'm his wife bree. i'm afraid he's out running errands, but he's told me all about you."
2593,Bree,it's not about you. i've just been going through some things.
519,Bree,"oh, george, please don't go!"
1087,Bree,yes. a bad one. i hope you haven't made plans for tomorrow night.
1495,Bree,"lynette, hi, it's bree.uh, listen,call me when you get this message,and please come to poker tonight.i have some big news about the applewhites."
3988,Bree,"well, clearly, i like to think of myself as a rich person even more."
1053,Bree,yes.
2390,Bree,what the hell is this?!
1646,Bree,and that's a--a real thing?
182,Bree,"zach,do you have any plans for dinner?"
150,Bree,"if you think i'm going to apologise for taking you out of a strip club, you're wrong! i consider it one of my finest moments."
4057,Bree,"see, this is why i wanted to check on my things. you don't leave a valuable painting on the damn floor. you need to put something underneath it."
3635,Bree,did edie show you the adams house?
3811,Bree,don't be ridiculous. tom's rudeness does not give you license to steal. return it immediately.
234,Bree,you play poker?
4117,Bree,why would you say that to me?
3956,Bree,"i hope so, because i just cannot take any more lying."
4044,Bree,was it florence?
3638,Bree,what are you doing?
2576,Bree,i can't tell you.
3111,Bree,"oh. how, um, colorfully put."
2039,Bree,"ah, she's right.this is all my fault."
2306,Bree,you had a child?
3015,Bree,"oh, how sweet."
545,Bree,thank you.
2845,Bree,"oh, my god. what did you do?"
748,Bree,yours is blue. danielle loves pink. and i have no idea what my own son's favourite colour is.
2855,Bree,"she said he had a tattoo on his shoulder, which i know isn't true because i've seen him at the pool, and i would've remembered 'cause tattooed people make me very uncomfortable."
709,Bree,there's this place called camp hennessey. it's designed for teenagers like yourself who have lost their way and--
3928,Bree,"that jail is--it's disgusting. all those men in cages, like animals. even to step foot in that place is humiliating."
3874,Bree,"i had hoped that this compulsion to steal was something we could solve privately, but orson seems unableor unwilling-- to control himself."
763,Bree,"we made our decision, let's just stick to it."
3701,Bree,"mine is so erratic. i'm not even sure what the real temperature is. of course, if a certain doctor would loosen the purse strings--"
137,Bree,keith. ian. andrew.
3532,Bree,at least the house won't be quiet anymore.
2125,Bree,"this was a cry for help, and if we don't listen, the next time she could do something even more dangerous."
3760,Bree,"oh, dear. i was hoping to spare your feelings, but since you know, i wasn't comfortable having my recipe made with substandard ingredients."
134,Bree,call andrew and find out where he is.
872,Bree,"i don't know. um, um, think of something unpleasant."
24,Bree,what do you mean what's in this? it's salad.
2324,Bree,thank you for clearing things up.
2150,Bree,it's a souffl. and timing is everything.
40,Bree,"we sat on skyline drive and drank a bottle of apple wine. and when we finished it, you turned to me and you said, if you marry me, bree mason, i promise to love you for the rest of my life. and even though i was engaged to ty grant, and even though my father didn't like you, i said yes."
1392,Bree,very--interesting.
3120,Bree,aah!
3055,Bree,"i hope so. truth is, i miss him. and i'll probably let him come home eventually. i just need to know he understands the gravity of what he did."
3316,Bree,i wanna buy you lunch and tell you in person. i will be at your office in two minutes.
1630,Bree,"andrew,the judge is not seriously gonna believe that i beat you."
908,Bree,rex? what is it?
1675,Bree,"peter. hi,it's bree."
3791,Bree,or taffy swallow. we moved around a lot and had three dogs.
2201,Bree,"i'm sure she'll be back soon. why don't we, uh, go have some cookies?"
2275,Bree,"mother hodge, i have your breakfast."""
3413,Bree,maryland?
4105,Bree,"no, i haven't."
380,Bree,maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.
384,Bree,"were you with a woman? did you tell her that you have a wife, or does that hinder your pick-up style?"
1442,Bree,"uh,no.i just wanted to ask you a favor."
52,Bree,"what? oh, oh, oh no, thank you. i have some things that i, i need to do today."
1865,Bree,come on.
2727,Bree,"shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
2408,Bree,"please don't touch me.all this time,you've said you wanted the truth.that's before i knew what it was."
819,Bree,"oh my goodness, well, this changes everything. a friend of mine is having a barbeque for her husband on saturday and i think you should come."
128,Bree,it's a tough call.
1198,Bree,"george, you won't believe it. i just stopped itching."
1533,Bree,a girl?
3482,Bree,"orson, don't cramp the boy's style."
3381,Bree,"careful, dear. you don't want to be ill tomorrow."
822,Bree,what is going on here?
2108,Bree,"yes, i know. she's my daughter. my 17-year-old daughter."
589,Bree,"well, it's just that my aunt fern lives in philadelphia and i don't want to be thinking about her while i'm spanking you with a leather strap."
3110,Bree,"now, now. we mustn't play favorites, although i will take that as a compliment."
2805,Bree,"well, i guess i'll just have to take my veal scaloppini and go home."
741,Bree,"well, porter was misbehaving so i had to punish him."
3941,Bree,"still, she was your mother."
2196,Bree,is she all right?
212,Bree,this is not up for discussion.
1889,Bree,"um, we, uh, just came over to introduce ourselves, but we can, um, do that at another time."
527,Bree,i'm not speaking to you.
3016,Bree,hire us? but we're not a business.
2705,Bree,"let's go get some cake, dear."
3037,Bree,and you'd probably go to prison.
1932,Bree,--to see who you really are--
429,Bree,"yes, it would--if i still felt anything for you. but as it stands, the place you used to occupy in my heart is very much empty now."
3773,Bree,"lynette, stop. wait. please. don't be this way. i don't want money to get in the way of our friendship."
2797,Bree,i was in a very naughty mood when i left that.
2779,Bree,so you'll replace it for free.
1921,Bree,"my children were my life.they were the reason that i got up in the morning, so to have failed them as a parent--"
1525,Bree,i know. um--i came to see you.
4125,Bree,"uh, she needs me to get something for her. i will be right back."
3115,Bree,no!
3680,Bree,"if by ""strings,"" you mean i won't let you be rude to me in my own house, then yes."
1629,Bree,so? you had one of the loveliest childhoods i've ever known.
2068,Bree,i cannot thank you enough for getting danielle interested in history. she has never worked so hard on a project before.
2288,Bree,"i know it sounds suspicious, but in my heart of hearts, i just can't believe that orson could do such a thing."
2458,Bree,"hello? hodge residence. oh, hi, danielle. listen, i am sending julie mayer an e-mail from you. now would you say that your school was off the hook?"
2995,Bree,"why not? i'm perfectly capable of presenting. i've done it for the last eight years. i mean, no one wants to accept an award from a woman who looks like she should be in line at the needle exchange."
2724,Bree,"are you sure? sweetheart, do you feel like you're making a mistake?"
1857,Bree,"hello. i'm bree van de kamp, your new neighbor.is this your frog?"
1137,Bree,"yes. this is rex. i, i want to thank you again for what you did. it was so refreshing to be treated with kindness after weeks of just ludicrous accusations."
3152,Bree,"yes, and the ""venus de milo"" is missing two arms. what's your point?"
1922,Bree,"well, my son is a sociopath, and my daughter hates me enough to have run away from home. i'm certainly not gonna get ""mother of the year"" anytime soon."
2253,Bree,"orson, what if something should happen to her?"
398,Bree,"oh! well, that's um, very thoughtful of you."
3317,Bree,"well, i'll wait in reception until it's over."
1853,Bree,that would be nice.
2922,Bree,"oh, lord."
2107,Bree,"no, no, no, no. i'd like you to take me to his room and unlock it so i can walk in unannounced."
63,Bree,"rex, wasn't that a lovely?"
4120,Bree,what is he wearing?
198,Bree,"and tell them what? we don't even have the note anymore, we gave it to paul."
1908,Bree,"well, i'm only supposed to be restrained until 7.you see, i have a problem with sleepwalking.they just tie me up so that i don't wander off and hurt myself."
329,Bree,yeah.
995,Bree,people have said that?
2437,Bree,"i'd love that. what about your mother? after all the things she's done, she's just gonna get off scot-free?"
362,Bree,you are strung out!
1444,Bree,"no,no,no,i think given the misunderstanding that i should get the bill."
3830,Bree,"well, we're on pins and needles. how's it going?"
2793,Bree,"oh, he just adores it. the three of us are such a happy little family. aren't we?"
1054,Bree,what?
2755,Bree,"do you think, while you're here, do could do a bris for my baby, too?"
2120,Bree,is my daughter all right?
3817,Bree,yeah.
1062,Bree,"no, that's why i need you to take the polygraph, too."
428,Bree,"yes, it is. the doctor said you could be here for weeks."
2338,Bree,"everyone, this is alma hodge, orson's first wife."
2294,Bree,i said i had concerns. concerns that have disappeared now that mike has been arrested.
3202,Bree,"please, danielle. you have no right to take him."
1172,Bree,"i'm sorry, george, but you have to go."
556,Bree,yeah.
2251,Bree,you cannot let your mother move into this neighborhood. it's filled with junkies and who*es.
2525,Bree,she will have stolen my entire identity.
2414,Bree,"oh, thank god."
4008,Bree,"oh, really? what a delightful coincidence. you know, i could bake these for you every week, and all i'd need in return is just the tiniest of favors."
3853,Bree,how about a confession? sit down. start talking.
4065,Bree,"no, she has a choice. it's entirely possible to get what you want without being perceived of as a nagging shrew."
2603,Bree,that is so kind of you.
1310,Bree,"i don't think so. but thank you, though."
1235,Bree,"that's why i wanted to talk to you. i mean, part of me just keeps thinking maybe i should just do it."
2834,Bree,it was just an observation.
2787,Bree,"no, thanks. i'm just dropping off andrew's cell phone. he forgot it again."
767,Bree,i can be just as cool as you can.
3547,Bree,no.
1395,Bree,"oh.bye, sweetie."
2827,Bree,would you like a nice cup of tea?
716,Bree,there's this place called camp hennessy.
290,Bree,"darned if i know. uh, danielle, everything in the north quadrant of your side is clothes and books and such, and the south side are miscellaneous items."
2327,Bree,"i just feel really awful about our fight, and i-i think it's time for an apology."
1192,Bree,"i know, and you have every right to be mad, but, george, i am really starting to itch."
2739,Bree,is everything okay?
1160,Bree,"i thought the duck turned out well. although the sauce was a little bit thick, but judging by how many helpings you had, i think i got away with it. what are you thinking about?"
3423,Bree,"well, let's talk about food. with a new client, what i usually do is discuss possible menus, and then i have my very best chef prepare a sample dinner."
1731,Bree,you making fun of me?huh?
331,Bree,"what i'm worried about, andrew, is that you don't seem to have a soul. give me one good reason why i shouldn't call the police!"
1280,Bree,"oh, honey, there's no reason why you and carlos can't try again."
1301,Bree,"i'm sorry to drop by unannounced, but i just had this disturbing visit from an old friend of yours. a leila mitzman."
1688,Bree,she's so adorable and i just love the name lily
452,Bree,"oh, these flowers are stunning. they're the best ones i've ever gotten."
757,Bree,yeah.
3662,Bree,do--do what?
2225,Bree,"now you listen to me. that woman gave you life, and the fifth commandment tells us to honor our parents no matter how hideous or repellent they may be."
78,Bree,is there somebody you'd like to invite?
2298,Bree,"well, needless to say, i won't be cooking dinner for ian's parents."
104,Bree,dr. goldfine.
768,Bree,"andrew, i would love you even if you were a murderer."
3467,Bree,orson! you can't be serious! here?
2580,Bree,no talking.
1851,Bree,"because when i sleep,i dream,and when i dream,i keep seeing andrew's face in that rearview mirror."
130,Bree,and we think that you should have it.
2719,Bree,"push, baby, push."
734,Bree,"well, then i will fix you a very nice bowl of peaches and cottage cheese."
998,Bree,probably.
2785,Bree,you're leaving our bed?
2233,Bree,"well, then talk to me. i know you're upset, but don't shut me out. please. please, gloria, let me in."
824,Bree,see? you were worried for nothing.
1677,Bree,"i know it's really late notice,but a friend of mine,uh,got engagedand she's throwing a party,and i thought,um,maybe you'd like to come."
956,Bree,"well, don't you think it'd be nice if reverend devoted part of the eulogy to his life after he was married?"
44,Bree,"hi, i'm bree, and this is my husband rex. and i brought you some homemade pot pourri."
482,Bree,"oh, packages! thank you."
609,Bree,what is wrong with nice invitations?
3613,Bree,just take it back.
3437,Bree,what?!
3051,Bree,"oh, come on, edie. you know, carlos, mike, karl-- you do have a way at picking at other women's leftovers."
2598,Bree,"this is what we get for having kids at our age--anxiety, terror."
962,Bree,"oh, yes, i am. i am going to hire security, and those security men are going to have sticks and if you so much as set foot in that sanctuary, they will be instructed to beat you with those sticks"
2402,Bree,sexually. she had sex with you.
1702,Bree,"my mother didn't think they were awful.when i made those same cookies for her,she loved them."
344,Bree,"well, maybe if we take it away from him, then he'll start to understand what he did! he has not shown an ounce of remorse since the accident."
2456,Bree,do young people still say awesome?
2868,Bree,this is a nightmare. what is going on?
1498,Bree,i don't know what you mean.
3331,Bree,partners? oh.
335,Bree,"lynette, you're a great mother."
1416,Bree,i didn't kill george.
2542,Bree,"yes, and get this--when adam said dylan was just going to keep asking questions, katherine said-- and i quote--""well, we're just gonna have to find better lies."" oh, hang on. i've got another call."
1431,Bree,bye.
755,Bree,"he blames me for his being here. he blames me for everything, and he's probably right."
1277,Bree,how are you?
2460,Bree,"well, perhaps if some of those rules had been in place when you took up with edie's nephew, you might not be in this little pickle."
884,Bree,"i don't know why, but i have this overwhelming feeling that you're gonna be just fine. i really do."
1486,Bree,all right.
3584,Bree,"oh, for god sakes, orson. let it go."
3585,Bree,"gaby, you never sell a man's autographed baseball."
765,Bree,"exactly. so we'll get him home, we'll get him into christian counselling so it won't become a lifestyle."
3438,Bree,are you telling me that i set katherine up with a convicted graverobber?!
1143,Bree,how can he have believed this?
3091,Bree,"orson, hear me when i say this. it's over. you have done unconscionable things for which i can never forgive you, and no amount of flitting about in my peripheral vision is going to change that."
2444,Bree,"i have missed you, sweetheart!"
1457,Bree,"i am not sure,but i think there was a compliment in there somewhere,so thank you.but i am not an escort."
1819,Bree,"isn't it darling?i made it for your party.it's a big ""1""and a big ""7""--for ""17."""
2173,Bree,is this why you apologized?
1521,Bree,"when i was young, my stepmother told me that i was very lucky.i possessed beauty,wit, cunning and insight.these were weapons all women needed to survive in the world."
293,Bree,"oh my god, thank god you're here. will you go take care of gabrielle? i have to go home for a minute."
467,Bree,"andrew, i'm so sorry that i said anything."
2250,Bree,thank you.
552,Bree,"if you could just tell me what he told you,then i could fix the problem."
92,Bree,"oh hi, paul, i was just?"
3049,Bree,"well, um, just so you know, in the future, i'm not comfortable with that. this can't happen again."
2678,Bree,"orson and i go to our club almost every saturday night, if you're-- interested in babysitting."
2666,Bree,"oh, darn, i forgot the napkins."
3738,Bree,we most certainly do--partner.
2967,Bree,"yes, of course. why wouldn't it?"
2904,Bree,i'll be right back.
4028,Bree,"uh, yes. as i recall, it's quite valuable."
2136,Bree,hello.
3984,Bree,"well, i like to think of myself as a good person."
3476,Bree,i didn't see you do that.
3877,Bree,"well, maybe you'll feel comfortable talking to a professional."
840,Bree,"oh, don't worry about it. here i want you to try one of these clams. i bet they're as good as the marinara sauce."
1295,Bree,yes.
1786,Bree,"listen,i don't expect you to lie about the alcoholism.i mean,they know that's how we met.it's just--you know,the other thing."
3621,Bree,i'm a caterer. i oversee events on thanksgiving. it's the one holiday that i don't need.
537,Bree,hi! wha-what are you doing here?
2016,Bree,okay.
2703,Bree,i expressly forbade her from coming tonight. who does she think she is?
3717,Bree,that was a lovely service.
3143,Bree,"all right, so i will call the ice sculptor and see if we can--"
1374,Bree,yeah. they found data in george's personal computer and also records at his pharmacy that pretty much proves that he was poisoning your father.
3071,Bree,not exactly.
3162,Bree,it was an accident.
3967,Bree,"i'm surprised. i knew she was a bit dotty, but didn't think it was that serious."
3628,Bree,"for melina? she'd probably blow her nose on it. no, i will not let that woman defile nana's lace."
2699,Bree,"well, unfortunately, our bleeding-heart town council forbids us from using live ammo in our own backyards."
1939,Bree,that rosotto was perfect.
3207,Bree,"now it's just a mock-up, but this is what the book is going to look like."
366,Bree,"i think andrew has been smoking marijuana, so i want you to take this and get it tested right away."
1182,Bree,i think so.
3820,Bree,"well, look who's here. somebody owes me $20."
1770,Bree,what?
2567,Bree,she's not here?
365,Bree,your son's urine.
204,Bree,hello?
4036,Bree,"yes, being a lady takes effort."
507,Bree," okay, now all you have to do is take a deep breath--"
3446,Bree,"a cosmopolitan. that's your favorite, isn't it?"
1102,Bree,george! george!
1245,Bree,"i am taking my champagne and my aging eggs, and i'm going home."
1709,Bree,oh.why?
2162,Bree,"oh, you don't believe any of that nonsense, do you? do you?"
2864,Bree,"hello, boys. bob, lee, i baked you some muffins to thank you for introducing me to walter here. and, walter, i decided you're absolutely right. dark shingles are the way to go. why are you all staring at me?"
933,Bree,oh?
3431,Bree,yes.
1124,Bree,"he is not a corpse. he is a man named rex van de kamp. he was a loving husband, a devoted father, and a successful doctor. so successful, in fact, that he left me enough money to sue the city, this precinct, and you two gentlemen personally just for the fun of it."
420,Bree,"well, then he can go to a motel because he's not allowed back in my house."
214,Bree,are you sure?
1244,Bree,"if you'll excuse me, i, uh, i have to go."
1112,Bree,"oh george, really?"
1377,Bree,"andrew, george williams fooled a lot of people."
457,Bree,"andrew, where did you come from?"
1647,Bree,it was just a peck on the cheek.
968,Bree,"well, then why did you say those things to me?"
1915,Bree,"anything at all.as you said, i--i have a lot of issues."
506,Bree,"okay, now i want you to hold the gun like you're holding a beautiful white dove. hold it firmly enough that it can't get away, but not so firmly that you can kill it. got it?"
1829,Bree,"well,i just keep messing it up.i don't know what's wrong with me."
636,Bree,"better still, be brutal."
2482,Bree,are you gonna back off now?
661,Bree,oh?
2090,Bree,because i thought you'd want to know.
2599,Bree,dead?
1085,Bree,andrew! you are not leaving the house dressed like that.
2502,Bree,absolutely.
1342,Bree,"well, when i broke up with george, i saw something in his eyes. it was a kind of malevolence, and it just didn't seem to me to be the sort of thing you could cure."
1056,Bree,"um, i, i was thinking of something else just then, so why don't you ask me the question again?"
2266,Bree,andrew brought her wine.
1801,Bree,"every child deserves to be loved unconditionally,and i thought that was the kind of love that i had for you.maybe if i had,it would've been different."
4031,Bree,was that necessary?
3442,Bree,"oh, my god. you slept with him?"
4093,Bree,what can we think of? he's holding all the cards.
1559,Bree,"oh,thank god! i'm so sorry.i don't know what happened.i was in the kitchen cleaning up after making cookies,and i looked in the living room,and they were gone."
3823,Bree,i hope you enjoyed that.
1506,Bree,"maxine, once again,this entire lunch was just out of this world. i just have to get the number of your caterer."
1224,Bree,"oh, my god! congratulations. oh george, i didn't even know you were looking."
1681,Bree,"hi. um,i need some advice from a professional.i'd like to get stinking drunk.do you have anything that can accomplish that in a hurry?"
3821,Bree,"you know, there could be a perfectly innocent explanation."
3367,Bree,you have nothing to be jealous of.
1411,Bree,"wake up, sleepyhead.i brought fresh croissants for breakfast!"
520,Bree,"why can't we talk this over? george, i -"
610,Bree,is lisa your friend with the pierced navel?
1273,Bree,"come on. when i finish up here, i will come over with my sewing kit and cut you out of that."
2534,Bree,"well, it's tradition. i always organize our little get-togethers, and i always bring dessert."
944,Bree,"yes, that is rex's mother."
3964,Bree,great. be back in a minute.
875,Bree,"well, you shouldn't be doing that. in case you've forgotten i'm married."
1157,Bree,"if you think i'm gonna lay next to someone for eternity who thinks i'm a murderer, you're crazy. as far as i'm concerned, let him decompose with strangers."
3486,Bree,why? i'm embarrassed enough as it is.
164,Bree,just because you didn't hear them fighting doesn't mean they were happy.
988,Bree,"for god sakes, phyllis, don't you ever worry about dehydration?"
1083,Bree,"stop it, the two of you, this instant! this was a perfectly lovely evening and now the both of you have ruined it. i will not tolerate this kind of behavior. do you understand?"
2037,Bree,"some reporter.all she could tell me is what neighborhood they found him in.they don't have any contact information, no phone number, no address."
327,Bree,"no, i won't, not until you tell me."
803,Bree,george. what about him?
2954,Bree,"lynette, why didn't you tell me?"
3414,Bree,you can't just up and move. you have a life here.
2375,Bree,i'm so sorry. i br--broke a glass.
3670,Bree,"uh, yeah. in the test kitchen."
2473,Bree,what a beautiful family.i feel so lucky to have you for a neighbor.
3280,Bree,"well, because she's all grown-up. you see, hot dogs and hamburgers are what make little boys and girls grow up to be big and strong. and now that she's grown-up, she doesn't need them anymore."
3548,Bree,and how exactly are you gonna stop snoring?
2002,Bree,"well, no one who knows you could seriously believe that you could hurt a woman. strangers may talk, but i know the truth."
2892,Bree,all righty. here you go.
616,Bree,so obviously we need to talk.
4091,Bree,a little? the man put chives in my parisian salad! he should be in a straightjacket!
696,Bree,"so, susan, what are you gonna do with the letter?"
1773,Bree,"needless to say,the agreement between us is off.caleb is dangerous,and i want him put away.if he is not gone by tomorrow,i am calling the police."
1790,Bree,"yes,i just--i'm worried you might be a little cold."
3338,Bree,"well, you've only been looking for a few weeks. i mean, give it another-- say, month or two, and you still haven't found anything, then we'll revisit the idea. okay?"
1191,Bree,"oh, please. it's not gonna help. george, clearly, this is psychosomatic. we need to go home."
3083,Bree,yes.
2698,Bree,really? i thought you were one of those liberal gun haters.
1903,Bree,"i am trying to ensure that they turn into responsible adults.trust me, rex, in the end, we will be rewarded."
974,Bree,give me your tie!
3372,Bree,"my name is bree, and i am an alcoholic."
354,Bree,"i understand that good help is hard to find, but stealing a family's nanny is so--unseemly."
2246,Bree,"what did she mean by, you can't afford not to? was she threatening you with something?"
2332,Bree,"by the way, when my friends ask you what happened--and they will--i don't think it's necessary to go into all that unpleasantness about orson and monique. all they need to know is that you're back and we're on good terms."
1867,Bree,do i know you?
1941,Bree,that is so adorable but i don't think i can eat another bite.
2058,Bree,"no, i don't think he will. i failed him."
3390,Bree,"oh, katherine, please."
395,Bree,because i have faith that he'll come back. and that he'll do the right thing.
1831,Bree,"people care about details.someday when danielle looks back,i want her to remember just how perfect her cake looked and how hard her mother worked to make her happy.this cake is a symbolof my love."
2788,Bree,"um, tom, may i ask you something? did you and lynette do the family bed when your children were babies?"
985,Bree,who was that?
1211,Bree,"george. i know what you want from me, and i, i thought i wanted the same thing, but i keep getting those rashes because i still feel married."
3313,Bree,"what is it, andrew?"
1359,Bree,''so what's happened?have you had any luck finding george?''
1231,Bree,#name?
1656,Bree,"i know that you're still angry with me,and,i wanted to tell you that i have,joined a recovery program.a.a.i just wanted you to know that--and to tell you i'm sorry.you are--a real friend,and i value your honesty."
412,Bree,they sure did.
3349,Bree,"orson, what are you doing in the guest bedroom?"
3386,Bree,go away. i don't feel well.
2609,Bree,reverend sikes said they're looking for items for the raffle.
453,Bree,ah. shall we?
2271,Bree,no. i'm done.
2127,Bree,i didn't call you that.
3199,Bree,"and now to finish, you simply transfer your spun sugar to the croquembouche and gracefully drape it around in a delicate swirl. did i mention that you--probably shouldn't be wearing jewelry while working with spun sugar? um--well, there's no law that says it has to be a delicate veil. i mean, it could really just be a beautiful, um, little, uh, white--ribbon. turn off the damn camera."
1561,Bree,no--no harm done.
1068,Bree,"i think perhaps the machine picked up on something, something that i wasn't aware of."
3048,Bree,he spent the night here?
3174,Bree,oh. sorry. paid for what?
2994,Bree,"katherine, no one expects you to be a martyr. why don't you go home?"
1616,Bree,is this libby's real hair color?
3848,Bree,who are we dishing? i do hope it's not me.
3227,Bree,"no. uh, mr. van de kamp is deceased."
3324,Bree,"orson, we're partners. we share everything. any success i have is just as much yours as it is mine."
1787,Bree,"they're just getting to know you,and so i want them to focus on your good qualities.i just don't know how they'll react if they find out that you're a sex addict."
200,Bree,but how?
1587,Bree,"his lawyer? well,why on earth would andrew need a lawyer?"
3809,Bree,really?
1551,Bree,"honey,you can't.they're at work."
2591,Bree,"oh, my god."
1881,Bree,"oh, they're fine.andrew is backpacking through europe, and danielle is away at cheerleading camp."
1907,Bree,"oh, i was afraid of that."
594,Bree,i do. would you mind if i ran these through the dishwasher once?
3209,Bree,"well, you knew what the book was gonna be called."
4074,Bree,no. all i want is out.
3070,Bree,"i don't think so. i'd hate for him to be around when you had another attack of delayed morality, either with edie or behind the wheel of your car."
837,Bree,what?
1725,Bree,"oh,they,uh,they already left."
3272,Bree,excuse me? you're teaching him?
2015,Bree,is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
1388,Bree,george paid for what he did to your father.
1188,Bree,"george, i can't."
2286,Bree,i asked orson to move out last night.
1673,Bree,"well,i just really feel likei'm jeopardizing my recovery by switching--"
1035,Bree,"i'm not refusing anything. all i'm saying is stay away from phyllis. she's a, she's a raving loon."
4079,Bree,"orson, i understand this is a shock, but you have to face facts. our marriage is over."
2268,Bree,what?
751,Bree,brown or green?
322,Bree,i feel awful for carlos. that talk about children was obviously coming from his grief.
2986,Bree,no! that's--that's my job. i always do it.
2503,Bree,no more secrets.
1186,Bree,i will let you make all the arrangements. something out of town would be nice. good night.
3082,Bree,"there's something i've been--keeping from all of you, and, um--we need to talk."
3944,Bree,"lynette, thank you again for driving."
1476,Bree,"honey, stop complaining.one day you'll wish that someone were offering to do your laundry."
153,Bree,yeah?
2072,Bree,"well, of course not. what is it?"
791,Bree,"no, i don't. and i need you there. i would be so lonely without you."
601,Bree,tell him that we found his condom and that he is forbidden from - y'know.
2783,Bree,don't be so sensitive. we'll find something to help you sleep--maybe some warm milk.
238,Bree,"oh,"" ""i suppose it can wait."
3598,Bree,"all right, you two, what is going on?"
3364,Bree,you need to leave now.
446,Bree,hi.
1573,Bree,"because what happened was,i accidentally mixed my antihistamine medication with,you know, a little glass of wine i was having, and i-i fell asleep, you know,while i was--watching her kids.i mean,i like a little wine with dinner,i mean,now and then. you know,who doesn't?but,uh,i mean,you know, to trash my entire reputation--"
1179,Bree,"you can think whatever you want, but to be honest, i don't believe in the subconscious."
1241,Bree,hi.
1041,Bree,"well, apparently, i'm a suspect. well, they always look at spouses first. it has something to with statistics. it's just a formality. i'll be cleared in no time. would you two please stop looking at me like that? obviously, i did not kill your father. i loved him deeply."
2465,Bree,"oh,andrew,i'm having problems with my strap.could you help me?"
1698,Bree,"eleanor,i thought you'd gone to bed."
2197,Bree,"i'm fine. i just, i'm running out of food, and it's not as if i can go to the grocery store."
1466,Bree,"well,that's good to hear,because most people on this street couldn't keep a secret if their lives depended on it."
2359,Bree,"don't worry, alma, i'm sure that, uh, edie can find you a house that won't give you nightmares."
2378,Bree,fishy? it couldn't be more obvious. alma killed monique. that's why she disappeared. and i bet she pulled the teeth so people would suspect her dentist husband.
3837,Bree,"uh, bruce, why don't i wrap up a piece of that tart to go?"
2697,Bree,how can i help?
1942,Bree,"ah.this is a little sudden, isn't it?"
3971,Bree,a bat?
989,Bree,i'm saying that even italians take a break now and again.
3916,Bree,"to be honest, i-i'm not feeling up to this. i'm gonna have to come back another day.female guard: fine. he's got another visitor scheduled anyway, so i don't even have to tell him you were here."
786,Bree,your baby pictures. look at that one.
3116,Bree,ohh!
2844,Bree,that she had an affair with adam.
2243,Bree,because your doctor says people taking your medication shouldn't drink. a warning you've chosen to ignore if the--lipstick on the vodka bottle is any indication.
1458,Bree,"look,i'm--$5,000."
1532,Bree,"oh, my god!sweetheart,i don't understand.why in the world would your mother treat you that way?"
1526,Bree,"yes.your mother told me all about you and i thought it it might be nice if, um,we had a little visit.i brought you some homemade cobbler."
1534,Bree,oh.
3639,Bree,"uh, no help needed. certainly nothing that would require your thumb."
878,Bree,"george, i do love you as a friend. i wish you could love me the same way back, but since you can't, goodbye."
2952,Bree,it did. it did help me.
455,Bree,"well, i guess i should go inside."
766,Bree,i may be freaked out. but that doesn't change how i feel about him.
2424,Bree,and you say he's just down the hall?
1987,Bree,your wife disappeared?
4107,Bree,you're fired.
3919,Bree,"if she's visiting my husband, i think i have a right to know"
4055,Bree,send me the papers when they're ready.
1571,Bree,"i'm really well.um,i just saw you all talking before lynette went off to work.what were you all talking about?"
535,Bree,here you go.
145,Bree,"god only knows what she's had to deal with in her life-abject poverty,drugs, domestic violence. maybe even molestation."
3903,Bree,"know you're disappointed right now, but you have to know, i really do want to find some way for you to be happy."
1665,Bree,hi.
1600,Bree,"because i'm not done with you yet.it's my job to teach you,and you are not half the mani know you can be."
2927,Bree,"well, last sunday, when you kept raising your hand--we don't really do that. the church isn't a place for questions. it's a place for answers."
3050,Bree,"oh, i-i-i think you know."
1744,Bree,"well,i am sorry,but the peter i know has a little more sense--"
230,Bree,"so how is it going with mike, susan?"
249,Bree,"okay, baby, where were we?"
3031,Bree,i assume you'll want the pewter cat.
89,Bree,"well, i wanted to invite you and your father to a dinner party tomorrow night."
703,Bree,you have to hand it to gabby and carlos. they do grieve better than anyone.
1579,Bree,"well,then i suggest you get a job."
3023,Bree,"oh, i see what's going on here. this is shameless emotional blackmail."
1523,Bree,caleb? is that you?
55,Bree,take off your coat.
3248,Bree,"yes, and he appears to be checking the guest list."
3079,Bree,what does that mean?
221,Bree,have fun.
2626,Bree,he wasn't banished.
2701,Bree,"try, um, gun city on route 6 by the baptist church. tell them i sent ya, and they'll give you a nice discount."
2774,Bree,"darling, sex is the last thing women want right after they've given birth."
1316,Bree,"ty! ty grant. oh, hi! what are you doing in town?"
1743,Bree,"because when it comes to sex,i have an unwavering moral compass.truly. a man could beg and plead all day long,and it wouldn't make any difference.so since i have such strong self-control,there's really no reason for us to end our friendship."
1409,Bree,"no, no, not him.helen rowland's son, john."
1695,Bree,"andrew,i find your concern ironic,given how tanked you were when you ran over our neighbor's mother with your car."
3581,Bree,"yes. if he's a part of your life, i want to get to know him. i think i'll serve fish."
830,Bree,"well, i decide who i need in my life, and i've decided that i need you. and that's all there is to it."
1398,Bree,"this is not a joke,andrew.what if the neighbors had seen you?"
476,Bree,thank you. i did too.
2522,Bree,that's hers!
2000,Bree,there'll be two hundred people staring at us.
1011,Bree,"i do. i'm just, i'm just not ready yet. but it was very sweet of you to think of me."
3843,Bree,look what got brought in with the dirty napkins.
3076,Bree,family?
1400,Bree,hi!
1078,Bree,"andrew, that wasn't a hint."
2572,Bree,"we, we certainly didn't mean to pry. let me just tinge that up for you."
3382,Bree,"uh, would anybody like some more frittata?"
1722,Bree,"oh,shoot! i wish you hadn't gone through that.now we have to have an unpleasant conversation,and we were having such a nice time."
1788,Bree,"sorry,i don't know what's taking danielle so long to get dressed."
1696,Bree,she's dead!
2872,Bree,"well, we'll just have to find him someone who's not good at gay math."
1576,Bree,hmm?
1810,Bree,i don't want to talk about it.
1449,Bree,i am not giving you anything.except the bill.
386,Bree,meet someone. i'm raising your children.
106,Bree,"i don't need much time, it just seems that you have more insight into my situation than i do. and i just think that-"
2645,Bree,thank you for the gift.
3904,Bree,so you've said.
2704,Bree,"oh, it's just a quick visit. she's driving back tomorrow."
1823,Bree,oh.okay.
3768,Bree,where are you going?
3239,Bree,chives! how could i forget chives?
3462,Bree,"oh. well, are you sure she's trustworthy?"
337,Bree,i used to get so upset when andrew and danielle were little. i used their nap times to cry.
469,Bree,no. that his father's only human.
3069,Bree,"yes, eventually, with a big, dopey grin on your face."
1125,Bree,"thank you. so, uh, what will happen now?"
81,Bree,not a drop!
4050,Bree,"so i'm just like everyone else, and you know everything i'm going to say."
1475,Bree,"oh, while i'm here i might as well grab some of your laundry."
1627,Bree,we are going home. wait tilli tell the judge about you stealing my credit cards and sneaking off.it's gonna do wonders for your little emancipation case.
3597,Bree,"well, if you'll excuse me, i am going to go get a pie that you are going to love. and you two are going to help me."
2627,Bree,"she's, uh, at boarding school--in switzerland."
983,Bree,"come on, phyllis. let's get you something to eat."
2910,Bree,"yeah, but i'm sure edna fletcher has been there since 9:00, kissing up to reverend sykes."
1307,Bree,"that's true, in the beginning."
443,Bree,"rex, i don't want to say anything that might upset you. the doctor says any undue stress could cause another heart attack."
1978,Bree,"no, no, no.i've had orgasms before."
1496,Bree,betty.what a surprise.
1134,Bree,that's all right. i'll wait.
1423,Bree,"if you wanna lie to the police,go right ahead.but please know that i will sue you."
2440,Bree,"and miss gaby's wedding? no, i'll be fine."
666,Bree,"oh, no. i refuse to give them this kind of satisfaction. open your menu."
87,Bree,"fine. oh, and doctor. if what he's about to discuss has anything to do with adultery, prostitution or internet pornography, i would really appreciate you taking a moral hardline."
1637,Bree,you sound like you're impressed.
2176,Bree,edie said he's a bachelor--
3179,Bree,good.
378,Bree,"hello? yes, this is she-- marijuana in his locker? oh, i'm just--horrified. there must be some sort of terrible mistake. um, yeah, okay. well, i will be right down."
3974,Bree,"well, it's wonderful to have you home. how's your head?"
3246,Bree,"yes, and i'm pretty sure that elderly woman with him was his mother!"
2555,Bree,"i, um--don't remember."
3379,Bree,it's not that easy. you know she'll be furious.
3873,Bree,"you're telling me you own a mug with a picture of bernadette peters in ""gypsy""?"
1957,Bree,hummm.orson.
2073,Bree,"oh, good. i mean, i'd hate to think he had no work ethic at all."
1979,Bree,"oh you know, that warm sensation, that tingling feeling of relief when it's over.no, no, this was much--"
2963,Bree,"oh, and, listen, bob and lee introduced us to this wonderful contractor, so we won't be imposing for long."
2811,Bree,"oh, andrew."
3577,Bree,i'm just trying to understand how my son could keep a secret like this from his own mother.
3328,Bree,oh. who?
3398,Bree,"i'm saying, maybe you should reconsider joining the company."
1832,Bree,"stop!one of the candles went out.um, we're gonna have to do this all over again.i'm sorry. i'll be right back."
1069,Bree,"that's why i need you to take the test and answer the detective's questions, because i'm not going to know exactly how i feel until we put this behind us, but then, once we do--"
659,Bree,thank you.
3293,Bree,"well, i've apologized till i'm blue in the face, but they're still leaving in the morning. now you're not speaking to me, either? they're just mad. things will be better next time."
2262,Bree,"gloria, i've been thinking and--"
1123,Bree,"the police dug up your father today.they think that somebody was poisoning him.apparently,i'm a suspect."
633,Bree,"oh, i see."
1639,Bree,"no,it makes it sound like i think i have a problem,and i don't."
332,Bree,"there's lynette's car, she's gotta be close."
2142,Bree,"and don't even think about blaming me,'cause if you so much as mention that we spoke,i'll phone the police."
2668,Bree,"she'll do what she can, but you mustn't overtax her. her heart is not very strong."
2380,Bree,orson! not on the duvet!
3265,Bree,"um-- let me be clear. i do no want him calling me ""bree."""
4018,Bree,you want me to rob my own house?
2427,Bree,"susan, stop. mike is innocent. he had nothing to do with monique polier's murder."
392,Bree,trust is overrated.
4017,Bree,i'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done.
2792,Bree,"okay. thanks. yes, um, we'll be going now."
185,Bree,"oh,zach. you know, my mother died when i was young. she was hit by a car."
689,Bree,"""well, you have to admit that's an efficient way to teach respect for boundaries. okay, how about this one. it's perfect for andrew. it's a ranch in montana. it has lots of fresh air and plenty of open spaces and daily classes in anger management."" "
866,Bree,hurry up. there're people waiting.
4092,Bree,"isn't it? i'm being blackmailed by a man i'm starting to despise, and if i don't pretend to love him, he can have me arrested."
2988,Bree,dig in.
700,Bree,you no longer get an allowance.
1306,Bree,"well, then why did you date her in the first place?"
3389,Bree,"i can't help myself, all right? my husband's gone. my son's gone. i have nothing left."
209,Bree,what is it?
3279,Bree,"oh, yes. your mother loved hot dogs. every day at lunchtime, she'd say to me, ""mommy, i want hot dog."""
3058,Bree,"well, of course. is everything all right?"
3337,Bree,"he gets it, dear. honey, you're my partner in life. but if we want to keep it that way, we shouldn't mix marriage and business."
435,Bree,"oh yes, he'll, he'll live. but the doctor said he's at risk for something called pericarditis. do you know anything about that?"
672,Bree,"well, it's just that you've been acting kind of odd lately."
2675,Bree,"oh, please, phyllis. even you have to agree that a girl who'd trade her baby for a convertible isn't ready for motherhood."
793,Bree,"thank you for a wonderful service, reverend."
2895,Bree,susan.
1776,Bree,--the courage to change the things we can--
2749,Bree,what is wrong with that? i thought we liked conformity.
2053,Bree,"andrew, you have every right to be angry with me, but if you knew how sorry i am--"
2728,Bree,wait. did you have that final scan?
3537,Bree,very routine and--and practically outpatient.
2565,Bree,"well, i was hoping that you could use these last few weeks for reflection and personal growth."
3695,Bree,now that's how you make an entrance.
4108,Bree,my knees haven't buckled yet.
1527,Bree,"so, caleb,besides your mother and brother,does anybody else know that you're here?"
4006,Bree,then again--m.j. does--love my macaroons.
1284,Bree,"so, i don't want every woman in this town talking about me behind my back."
2394,Bree,"oh, i knew it. these are sleeping pills, and these are--oh, my god. you raped my husband!"
3099,Bree,so it's been two days now. did you and mike finally land on a name?
3749,Bree,they are?
3226,Bree,"well, i think a lot of people miss the way life used to be--back when women had more time to cook. it's always been important to me to have the family gather around the table every night for hot, lovingly prepared meals."
2782,Bree,"i was going to say angry, and perhaps that anger began when we exiled you to the nursery. i'm just trying to learn from my mistakes."
2467,Bree,"well,not if we're careful."
2977,Bree,"well, perhaps i could try something new. let's go with the lisianthus."
916,Bree,"um, he's stable, but, um, they have to put in a pacemaker, so they're gonna need to operate. how did you guys know?"
3752,Bree,but that's commercial parmesan.
3198,Bree,sorry. oops!
4089,Bree,"filing a false insurance claim. he's the one who filed it, but he's gonna say that i told him to."
2911,Bree,damn right.
979,Bree,thank you.
86,Bree,"why? i'm your wife, you can say anything in front of me. all we need is a few more sessions, and i'm sure we can."
3322,Bree,so you've been pretending to go to work for three weeks?
620,Bree,john rowland? i thought you broke up with him.
649,Bree,i need a favor.
941,Bree,what a waste.
4000,Bree,i just want to protect what is rightfully mine. can you help me?
3778,Bree,"oh, look! there's pretzels and cereal. i can see why they call it ""party mix."" it's like a party in a bowl."
3365,Bree,hi.
2826,Bree,"hi there. i- i don't mean to intrude, but are you all right?"
3644,Bree,"uh, thinking about it. they're thinking about moving to oakdale."
269,Bree,is that relevant?
444,Bree,"it's a romantic date with a single attractive man, and i intend to french the hell out of him."
3429,Bree,"well, katherine's been lonely, so i set her up with a client, and he's been there for over four hours, so you know it's going well!"
3797,Bree,andrew has been with me since i launched the company. he runs every aspect of the business. he deserves what he's making.
580,Bree,"well, come on, this just reeks of unresolved childhood trauma."
1588,Bree,"honey,what happened to-- to your face?"
596,Bree,i want you out of the house!
3977,Bree,"hmm. and that's all you were doing, just going out for a walk?"
1193,Bree,george--
2499,Bree,"because i'm her mother.and i know what i've created,and that's the real humiliation.orson.this child deserves better.and i know what to do now. please,please let me try."
3159,Bree,i did not tell you to put mums in that arrangement! and don't point your finger at me or i'll snap it right off.
2226,Bree,"orson, it's implied! now get out there and show her some respect!"
464,Bree,"no, we are not going to have sex!"
515,Bree,i don't think that would be wise.
1710,Bree,yes.i'd be curious to know just what it is you see in him.
1111,Bree,"what he said to you was horribly rude. that camp, it's extreme and unless i felt like andrew was getting really out of control, then-"
2970,Bree,"oh, i think i know what's going on. somebody had a naughty dream."
1432,Bree,"oh,hi."
255,Bree,"""see, but i don't think that's the reason. after i left the motel, i um, did some thinking about us and our sex life, and i realized there has been a disconnect, but it's coming from you."
3425,Bree,"well, that's what's so great about it. technically, it's a business dinner. it has all the potential upside of a date while still being tax-deductible."
2600,Bree,mm.
582,Bree,what do you want me to say? my husband likes to wear metal clamps around his nipples. hooray?
2877,Bree,"oh, sure. just, uh, leave your trays in the hall when you're ready."
1841,Bree,open your mouth.i wanna smell your breath.
2718,Bree,"i need your services as a doctor, but before i tell you what's going on, i need you to promise that what you're about to learnmwill be kept in strictest confidence."
3594,Bree,say anything about what?
2694,Bree,"you always say that like it's something to be proud of, but the day i see even a glimmer of myself in you is the day that i realize you've finally started-- to grow up."
3642,Bree,"well, did it occur to you i might want to sit next to the boys?"
3764,Bree,caught a couple of breaks? i've worked my ass off to get where i am.
758,Bree,"don't get up. i'll be quick. andrew, all any parent can do is try to provide their child with the tools to succeed in life. education, love, a good, clean safe home. well, i have given you those things and i'm through feeling guilty. so if you want to piss your life away and blame it on how horrible things are at home, then go ahead. but i want it stated for the record that i am a good mother. do you hear me? i am a good mother."
70,Bree,"lynette, these cards are sticky."
2883,Bree,"oh, thanks, dear."
2564,Bree,"yes, and it is going to stay that way because i have instructed sister theresa to keep you sequestered in your room until the baby is born."
2010,Bree,none whatsoever.
1197,Bree,okay.
1766,Bree,"well, that's not your life anymore."
896,Bree,i see.
2115,Bree,the oddest thing happened at the club today. tish atherton--
1215,Bree,"well, i'll just have to get over it, won't i?"
3505,Bree,"any minute. oh, my gosh, andrew. don't you look sharp today?"
2550,Bree,"hey, susan! what's up?"
498,Bree,"well, we sure have had some fun."
3077,Bree,how did you--
3993,Bree,but i thought you just split everything done the middle.
3512,Bree,you say that like it's a bad thing. i think that decade had a lot to recommend it.
905,Bree,"well, then how do people know because we both know that i wouldn't say anything."
3852,Bree,"andrew, cancel my lunch. no, everything's fine. your stepfather's just misplaced a few things, and i need to find them."
1931,Bree,if that's what it takes-- to get my daughter--
2536,Bree,"well, you've certainly mastered that, dear."
3157,Bree,i've already told you. turn yourself in to the police and let justice run its course.
1735,Bree,oh.
483,Bree,"hello! oh, hi, lynette! what?"
1346,Bree,yes.
74,Bree,really? wouldn't that be in poor taste?
1232,Bree,okay.
2211,Bree,"lakeview? oh, you gave me the impression that she was back east."
3180,Bree,so you're back?
1661,Bree,what do you mean?
2741,Bree,"susan? hi. it's, uh, bree. i'm glad you're home. uh, listen, i-i thought i might stop by for a little visit."
3228,Bree,"but in regards to my husband, i should make one thing very clear--his passing had nothing to do with my cooking."
1557,Bree,"mrs. mccluskey,hi.have you seen the scavo boys?"
684,Bree,"well, glad that you asked."
4026,Bree,we should probably break a window to make it look more real.
2101,Bree,you're awful.
2060,Bree,"because there is a bottle of chardonnay in the refrigerator, and right now, this little chore is the only thing that's keeping me from going inside and drinking the whole damn thing."
2999,Bree,"well, uh, this has been an evening full of, um--surprises. i never would've imagined that, um, i would be recognized by this wonderful organization --"
97,Bree,rex cries after he ejaculates.
3825,Bree,it's orson.
834,Bree,rex just hates these cooks tours. he likes to stay at home with the same old spaghetti and mug of root beer.
1541,Bree,"well,i didn't wanna come here because i was afraid it would drudge up memories of my husband.you know,this was our place.rex passed away recently.he was,um,murdered by our pharmacist."
731,Bree,you know pictures are prettier if you colour inside the lines.
264,Bree,"more wine? so, uh, reba, emma and lori-- why don't you girls come to the kitchen and help me with the snacks?"
3396,Bree,"no, you will not. i forbid it."
951,Bree,"anyway, i'm afraid that my visit has an ulterior motive. the organist at our church is on vacation, and edie britt mentioned that you used to be a concert pianist, and -"
3238,Bree,hmm.
1073,Bree,exactly. i hope you don't mind.
807,Bree,they did?
3519,Bree,why?
3917,Bree,another visitor? who?
2577,Bree,it's private.
3810,Bree,tom has a lot on his mind. i'm sure he didn't mean it.
762,Bree,i would love to.
66,Bree,"well, i care. they don't need to be burdened with our marital problems, and if we're working things out, the least we could do is try to keep up appearances."
1504,Bree,"well, perhaps i got more excited than i should have,but i recently found out that betty applewhite is quite the poker player,and so, uh, i have invited her to join our weekly game."
2680,Bree,"i need something that will fly, phyllis."
1497,Bree,"uh, now is actually not a good time for me."
2876,Bree,"oh, thank you so much for letting us take over your dining room."
3619,Bree,what?
2858,Bree,the fire captain said they have to go slowly. they don't want debris suddenly collapsing into the basement.
2474,Bree,it's my pride and joy.
152,Bree,neither do i.
3282,Bree,oh. well--in that case--
1870,Bree,what are you doing here?
98,Bree,"so, uh, where are you going?"
1553,Bree,"all right,boys,let's have it."
2912,Bree,"i am sorry, but i have to make sure that he doesn't let her chair that committee."
3831,Bree,maybe we should slice the tart in here. i don't want to bring a large knife in this.
3300,Bree,hi! come on in!
623,Bree,"honey, i am looking out for your happiness. now, i understand what it's like to be young and feel urges, but i waited until i got married, as did your father, and it was so much better."
12,Bree,"it's ok? andrew, i spent 3 hours cooking this meal. how do you think it makes me feel when you say it's ok, in that sullen tone?"
3715,Bree,"i can't believe you saved this. of course, i'm not really in the mood to write a cookbook right now."
770,Bree,it's for his own good. you'll see.
1736,Bree,"um, excuse me.i don't know what that means,but could you please stop saying it?"
10185,Lynette,"well, what are we gonna do about that?"
10670,Lynette,hello.
10146,Lynette,see ya.
8737,Lynette,ooh!
12191,Lynette,"yeah, we're crazy that way. i don't know why you're complaining about handicapped spaces. doesn't carlos have one of those blue placards?"
12226,Lynette,"if you insist on questioning my husband about a crime he didn't commit, you should at least have all the facts."
8904,Lynette,they won't make it to their later years if i have to spend all day with them.
12647,Lynette,"okay, well, just so you know, i hit back."
11050,Lynette,"what--okay, watch her!"
8710,Lynette,i said you could go by the pool. do you have your swimsuits on??
8903,Lynette,i know you did not just say that.
9447,Lynette,that's me. never afraid to create a scene.
9999,Lynette,"i left a proposal on my desk at work. i have to go over it tonight, or you-know-who's gonna have my head."
11088,Lynette,"but, see, the only reason they fired him is because people were gossiping, and the only reason they're gossiping is because of what i told mrs. mccluskey."
9960,Lynette,does your dad know you're out here?
12017,Lynette,she did? is she okay?
9301,Lynette,what?
11326,Lynette,what was that?
11235,Lynette,my pills! my pain pills are in my bag.
12057,Lynette,thanks. and don't worry. i'll have a talk with my kids. i promise they'll keep a lid on the destruction.
9202,Lynette,i'm so happy to see you. it's such a shame that alison couldn't make it.
13011,Lynette,oh. that job. i don't know what to say.
11519,Lynette,"hey, do you still want me to look at that book report?"
8988,Lynette,exactly!
11554,Lynette,"oh, come on, gaby, be fair. you put us in a really awkward position."
12391,Lynette,"yeah, yeah! keep complaining. i'd love to make it a year. now clean this place up. now!"
11080,Lynette,"okay, okay, we've all made some excellent points and blown off a little steam. whoo! let's play some cards."
11115,Lynette,okay.
11165,Lynette,"hey, it's me. you wanna meet for lunch?"
9162,Lynette,i remember talking to her right before she disappeared.
13133,Lynette,"yeah. but just to be on the safe side, if i fall in my tub again, let me die there."
10516,Lynette,"well,you've been working so hard,off on business trips all the time.tonight,we throw caution and cholesterol to the wind.you deserve a little comfort food."
10974,Lynette,yeah--
10895,Lynette,"fine, gaby! don't say hi!"
11755,Lynette,i know.the timing is terrible.
11450,Lynette,for pasta? are you crazy?
10642,Lynette,sort of.
11844,Lynette,what?
12725,Lynette,what the hell is going on? where's porter?
9871,Lynette,thank you.
11182,Lynette,my husband is in trouble. i love him. shouldn't i want to help him?
8716,Lynette,"paul. we have to leave now. once again, i am so sorry for your loss. go!"
11634,Lynette,good.
9659,Lynette,you're right. i'm sorry.
11350,Lynette,"orange says, ""beware. something bad's gonna happen."" that's why they use it for life vests and traffic cones and convicts. also, it washes me out completely."
10296,Lynette,"are you judging me?because if you are,you couldn't say anything"
11011,Lynette,not so much them.
10083,Lynette,thanks.
9191,Lynette,sure.
9752,Lynette,"wow. so, um, i, i take it you took the rat outside?"
10110,Lynette,"come on, gaby.it's a small town. people talk."
12479,Lynette,"oh, come on, tom. this is not your--"
12741,Lynette,"i called you, like, five times."
9245,Lynette,so this is it! this is the secret that mary alice was trying to protect
13282,Lynette,why didn't you ever tell me this?
12677,Lynette,"well, then you can face statutory rape charges without the money. your call."
9841,Lynette,oh. goodie!
9459,Lynette,you spanked my son?!
9733,Lynette,hello? hi!
13024,Lynette,actually--i am kinda tired. i think i'm going to head inside.
12390,Lynette,unbelievable. you guys are grounded for two weeks.
10876,Lynette,"oh, dear god."
12134,Lynette,"so i'm clear, you can't be bothered with saving your eternal soul because the pistons have no defense?"
10353,Lynette,what--what was what?
10257,Lynette,you are so not allowed to complain to me.
10355,Lynette,is this about me being boss again?you gotta get over it.
13268,Lynette,excuse me?
11891,Lynette,what?
12740,Lynette,"preston, why didn't you pick up when i called you?"
9474,Lynette,"i mean it this time, these are not just words. if you do this, so help me."
8843,Lynette,"yeah, i know."
11394,Lynette,hi.
12807,Lynette,i'll sew anything you want if you just stop getting me pregnant.
12452,Lynette,porter sent me a sex poem.
11243,Lynette,here you go. you can come back for seconds. our famous pepperoni pizza.
11462,Lynette,"it's delicious, huh?"
9350,Lynette,i can't believe how lucky you were today.
11823,Lynette,"are you kidding? it's genius. he's a sponge, but he talks!"
12009,Lynette,"it is a lot easier to resent your parents when you know they're safe in some retirement village, but to know that she's out there, maybe lying facedown in an alley--"
9710,Lynette,why on earth would you let them finger paint before breakfast?
9689,Lynette,"great. listen, uh--"
12340,Lynette,wait. they could take my children?
12802,Lynette,"no, you don't have to do that."
12544,Lynette,"no. but watching you, i look down on me. when i held your book in my hands, i felt so jealous my stomach hurt. and i thought, if i could just hitch a ride, have a piece of it, i wouldn't feel so bad about your success."
11741,Lynette,shhhhh!
13271,Lynette,i'm pregnant.
11896,Lynette,me? why would she do that?
9703,Lynette,"here's how i see it. you guys run a really good shop, but if you want your agency to go to the next level, you have to focus on two things. first, you've gotta win some awards. do some p.s.a.s, pro bono stuff, whatever it takes, because whether they admit it or not, clients care about what's in your trophy case. two, your web site. it's the first thing a client's gonna look at, and it's hard to navigate. there's no site map. it just wasn't built for people who grew up without computers. there. and third, i don't have a third. yeah, so that's it."
13032,Lynette,do i spill my salary?
11317,Lynette,"hey. it's after nine. come on, thomasina, it's time to get up."
9369,Lynette,"oh. that is a load off my mind. well, thank you."
12842,Lynette,"hey you go, walter. she's all yours."
12451,Lynette,"oh, crap on things."
10163,Lynette,we're not having any more kids.why would it matter?
10068,Lynette,oh.
11551,Lynette,"hey, gab. hi."
9160,Lynette,"you see this gum? if you promise to be quiet while i am downstairs playing cards, it's all yours. deal?"
9634,Lynette,you're gonna lose it?
12709,Lynette,"oh, sure."
11084,Lynette,wow. what is all this?
8748,Lynette,"boys, guys, i'm begging you, sit in your seats. i'm not gonna tell you again! buckle up! i mean it, so help me, i'll-"
13092,Lynette,i say we keep showing up here until he lets us help him.
9558,Lynette,i did not mean it that way.
10626,Lynette,how could he abandon her if he didn't even know she existed?
9793,Lynette,is that why he's sleeping with an umbrella?
9736,Lynette,i'm sorry. am i interrupting?
12433,Lynette,you were on the same little league team.
9699,Lynette,"hi. guys, i'd like you to meet penny. she gives me all my best ideas."
9022,Lynette,"you're never going to be a sailor, what do you care? okay everybody, let's just take a break!"
11787,Lynette,"nobody likes hospitals. unfortunately, that's the place you have to go when you're sick, or your friends are. you are my friend, right?"
11097,Lynette,"i heard about rebecca on the news. if there's anything i can do to help, i--with the funeral arrangements, or, uh--help you call relatives--"
12111,Lynette,here you go.
9584,Lynette,"there, now you have easier access."
11289,Lynette,it's good.
12026,Lynette,"hey, i'm not complaining."
10955,Lynette,"oh, forget it! forget it! we'll work that out later."
11540,Lynette,there you go.
13096,Lynette,that'd be great.
9818,Lynette,no. no. why?
10419,Lynette,"i don't either,but on the other hand,she spanked my kids,she lied about her drinking and i once saw her bitch slap her mother-in-law.so i'm torn."
10745,Lynette,"oh, well why don't you take a muscle relaxant."
9579,Lynette,"i told you, honey, daddy and i have a special meeting tonight."
12746,Lynette,"but you have been talking to him. what the hell, preston?!"
10915,Lynette,"everything's all right, so you can just go back into your room and play."
10447,Lynette,so you think that now he's obsessed with--
10743,Lynette,hey.
9075,Lynette,i've got a nanny--
9899,Lynette,"all right, now you're being ridiculous."
12840,Lynette,i can't help feeling there's more we could have done to honor him.
12762,Lynette,what?
9538,Lynette,you heard me.
11113,Lynette,"this is nellie. my grandma gave her to me when i was little, and i was hoping you could take care of her for me."
10369,Lynette,"but,honey, it goes back and forth."
12404,Lynette,"oh, my god."
9808,Lynette,"i couldn't find mrs. mulberry's umbrella so i brought her her sun hat instead, all right? and, here we go."
12225,Lynette,so when are you guys gonna finish grilling my husband?
11599,Lynette,no. that's just me. tom's always kicking the covers off the bed. he calls me his little blonde furnace.
10486,Lynette,"ed? hey,i'm so sorry,but obviously that was just meant for tom's eyes only."
10610,Lynette,"neither are stretch marks, but what are you gonna do?"
12327,Lynette,my gosh! that is so sweet. thank you so much.
12281,Lynette,come on. i do.
10866,Lynette,"of course you did, 'cause you're a smart guy, which is also why you are gonna jump on the idea i have to make the whole thing work."
12493,Lynette,"i'm married to a 45-year-old man who has a red convertible. yeah, i think i know."
12913,Lynette,thanks. and do you have the calzones for table three?
8849,Lynette,"of course, of course."
11487,Lynette,"i just heard on the radio the power company is still having problems, and there might be another rolling blackout today. do you want me to leave ida's number in case something happens?"
12717,Lynette,shut up!
13173,Lynette,then what's wrong?
10835,Lynette,"maybe i'd like to write a book or, you know, start my own magazine. and then i think, no, i can't. i have a family to support, and i am okay with that--"
8714,Lynette,"get out. or i will get in this pool and just grab you, get out! get over here. get over here. get back or i'll kill you."
10097,Lynette,"oh, you're kidding!"
9458,Lynette,"now when you say punishment, what exactly are you talking about?"
9214,Lynette,where are you going?
12132,Lynette,"ah, it's just--we've been through a lot lately, and we have a lot to be thankful for. don't you think we owe the big guy a little face time?"
9226,Lynette,"i just, i expected a bigger reaction. i've been sitting here with knots in my stomach."
11536,Lynette,i agree.
11022,Lynette,"oh, i just say so. come on."
12924,Lynette,"guys, easy."
10581,Lynette,"your family had eight sets of twins over three generations, not to mention your relatives in kentucky with triplets!triplets! so i ask you, do i not deserve to punish this man severely?"
12666,Lynette,"tom, i was 6 feet away. porter looked warren schilling in the eye and said, ""you're dead. i don't care what it takes. you're dead."""
12699,Lynette,why would you do that?
9544,Lynette,"and i know tom loves me, but i don't trust this woman. i think there's an agenda there. i don't know, maybe i'm being paranoid."
12179,Lynette,"oh, well, that's nice. thank you."
10628,Lynette,i don't see another way to make this work.we've gotta dip into the pensions.
12430,Lynette,got a sec?
12154,Lynette,okay.
12425,Lynette,"i know. that car is your baby. if only there was something i felt that intensely about. oh, wait! there is-- my actual babies."
9942,Lynette,wait!
12697,Lynette,"you are up for manslaughter, and you're worried about being embarrassed?"
11829,Lynette,"i know. just, this is a really hard one."
10480,Lynette,"thanks, jer."
10756,Lynette,"no, my favorite game is counting all the things i'm dying to say to you but i don't. like--pipe down, you annoying nut job.' i'd never say that."
9180,Lynette,what?
9571,Lynette,it's nothing.
12773,Lynette,"look, tom, i can't talk now. just call bob. i'm going over there now. okay. bye."
9693,Lynette,thank you.
11824,Lynette,yeah. i guess that anti-nausea medicine finally kicked in.
10941,Lynette,"ah, i see you've heard from our lawyer."
9504,Lynette,"well, isn't she home? she usually doesn't go anywhere."
9767,Lynette,you know how the first hour of the morning meeting is always so slow? 'cause i've got this thing--
9090,Lynette,"so, how are things with you and rex?"
9772,Lynette,this system is gonna let mommy be with you on your first day of school. the resolution is fantastic.
11899,Lynette,"after you get rid of this fountain, that's it, right?"
9619,Lynette,mike's a decent guy.
11517,Lynette,of course we're with you. we will give edie the cold shoulder.
12869,Lynette,"oh, no. it's fine. we use it all the time."
11726,Lynette,"oh,sweetie."
8803,Lynette,"can't, i already cancelled the sitter."
11171,Lynette,"yeah,i-i know.and hey,don't tell him i stopped by.i'm not supposed to be here.i just wanted to sneak a peek."
13000,Lynette,"okay, that's it. four shrug. i'm out. thanks for your help."
12975,Lynette,"oh, you were. you were the best person who ever worked for me. i used to be his boss."
13293,Lynette,"parker, i swear i will spank you, knock it off."
9666,Lynette,thank you. here.
12216,Lynette,"yeah. i was thinkin', if anyone asks about that fire at rick's, it'd be good if you had someone to account for where you were."
12421,Lynette,"tom, relax! you high-spirited kids do whatever it takes to have fun."
11152,Lynette,he already did.
9573,Lynette,we haven't had sex in ten days. and the longest we've ever gone before is nine.
11103,Lynette,"well, the police did arrest mike. i mean, i know you think he's innocent, but surely you can understand why bree's feelings have changed."
10145,Lynette,sounds like a plan.
9663,Lynette,"who? me? i've been out of work for seven years, i'm a woman of a certain age in a business that values youth above all else. why should i be nervous?"
10489,Lynette,"i appreciate that.you know, ed--i don't wanna pry into your personal business,but if you are having problems in that area,you don't have to be resigned to it."
12413,Lynette,have you been drinking?
9518,Lynette,we don't have to be friends. but we're two human beings living on the same piece of earth. we could at least help each other out once in a while.
11488,Lynette,did you read our review in the paper?
12464,Lynette,"okay. well, for what it's worth, i loved our conversations, and i'm-- going to miss them."
9717,Lynette,"no. no, no, no, no. no. i'm not saying it has to be sparkling."
12278,Lynette,there are opportunities that you can see that--i'm not! what would be my agenda?
11329,Lynette,"well, you didn't have to plan anything, but you did, even though we had an agreement. you like ties? you're getting a tie."
10114,Lynette,you're kidding.
12742,Lynette,yeah.
10411,Lynette,"all right.that's-- not why you came to apologize,is it?"
10893,Lynette,okay.
12324,Lynette,"at this point, because of the way you're acting. please don't do this, kayla. we have been having such a nice time."
11330,Lynette,"i have been dragging my ass all day, and the only thought that's kept me going is the hot bath, and now i have do my hair and shave my legs."
9172,Lynette,yes! yes! i am mad at you.
12996,Lynette,"yes, i helped advertise what companies decided to market. it's the same thing. come on. you know i'd be great."
12928,Lynette,i think this can all wait until morning. don't you?
11928,Lynette,don't do that. i wanna be sad when they knock it down.
11790,Lynette,"""top ten new hairstyles"". yeah, well, i'm kinda bald right now, but thanks."
11294,Lynette,come on. we need you at your best tonight.
9668,Lynette,apparently rex's heart just gave out.
10865,Lynette,"i don't know if you noticed,but when you first pitched the whole pizza concept--i was a wee bit skeptical."
11176,Lynette,"no, he didn't. don't, um, restaurants make half their money on the liquor?"
12319,Lynette,mm-hmm.
11215,Lynette,"oh. well, that's good to know. when you think about it, me going back to work is not that big a deal. we're only losing a little time together in the afternoon."
9611,Lynette,"you told me duggan's coming back to work today, i thought i'd do something special for him."
9049,Lynette,is this seat taken?
11785,Lynette,"oh, not that. okay, i don't know how to say this, so i'm just gonna say it. when everyone was offering to come with me to chemo--even katherine, who i don't even know, you sort of clammed up. what was that about?"
11460,Lynette,yeah?
10325,Lynette,"yeah. no,i get the subtle distinction.i think we can do better.okay? so,sally,you're up.what do you got for me?"
10425,Lynette,she must be.it's hard for me to imagine the bree i know capable of hurting you.
12320,Lynette,okay. good times.
10054,Lynette,okay.
12027,Lynette,"ah, there's booze-illa now."
10813,Lynette,"aw, you're sweet. bree, i'm sorry. i think you gotta follow your heart on this one, even if it isn't the easiest thing to do."
11606,Lynette,"and he makes them with pancetta and garlic and olive oil. it's really, really good. it's gonna be our special tonight."
9981,Lynette,'cause i've got an important assignment for you.
12526,Lynette,oh!
10867,Lynette,"no. no, no, no, i am totally on board."
12416,Lynette,and so we have decided to let you go to the homecoming dance tonight--
12248,Lynette,"tom, they're not serial killers. they're two little boys who were afraid their parents were breaking up."
11478,Lynette,"oh, wow. candles, too?"
10015,Lynette,"oh. well, welcome. what happened to stu?"
8704,Lynette,please tell me you punched him.
11360,Lynette,"because i need to win one, tom."
8916,Lynette,"oh, okay."
10155,Lynette,it is not the ebola virus.it's chicken pox.you are being a baby.
9903,Lynette,thank you.
9805,Lynette,"well, parker, we don't have time."
10436,Lynette,that's fantastic!
12061,Lynette,i didn't realize there'd be a cat. tom's really allergic.
12256,Lynette,"no, the twins did, but they say it was your idea."
9198,Lynette,okay. just wait.
9642,Lynette,could you talk to me for a second? i don't understand.
9406,Lynette,it was really nasty and he wouldn't shut up either.
9866,Lynette,okay. one drink.
10981,Lynette,hey.
11130,Lynette,"well, i didn't know what else to do. i'm trying to win over a little girl who clearly doesn't want a new mother."
11404,Lynette,how old do you think i am?
12693,Lynette,a witness? what are they talking about?
10450,Lynette,"no,not exactly.i'm just--i'm trying to understand why you--did that."
9602,Lynette,sound asleep.
10994,Lynette,"no, no, afraid not."
10413,Lynette,"and--so-- what,you want me to lie?make you look good?"
10490,Lynette,"i mean, you and fran could spice it up a bit.you know, get the old juices flowing again."
9671,Lynette,"aw, sweetie."
9707,Lynette,give it to her! give it to her!
10630,Lynette,"well, we need to show her we're serious. $30,000?"
11511,Lynette,i know. i'm a horrible person. i just chose ravioli over motherhood. i should--i should go home.
13120,Lynette,"if tom finds out, he'll freak. he has this weird thing about being the only guy who gets to see me naked."
10709,Lynette,"i just, i, i, you know, you don't wanna throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting."
10340,Lynette,huh?
11195,Lynette,"and, harry--harry, what did i say?"
9183,Lynette,"no, you see, here's the thing -"
9341,Lynette,"well, it is for the rich bee-eye-tee-see-atch's--"
10281,Lynette,just the twins and penny?
12145,Lynette,"okay, i give you that one. but what about the tornado that just happened? you can't blame man for that."
9974,Lynette,can i ask a question?
10936,Lynette,i'll look as soon as i get back from the store.
10402,Lynette,hey.what's wrong?
10991,Lynette,shot? where did you hear that?
9664,Lynette,thank you.
10561,Lynette,and what if i see him with another woman? what then?
8989,Lynette,"why not? start by targeting the top chain, then branch out from there. boom, boom, boom. mass saturation. oh, and you know what else would be a great idea? here's the thing --"
10853,Lynette,"well, hey, we're celebrating, right?"
12268,Lynette,"well, i thought you might like to have a safe place where you could share your feelings. you know? with your mom's death and moving in with us, you've been through a lot."
9893,Lynette,"okay, don't be distracted by that. look at me. here i am tomorrow, making my presentation."
9352,Lynette,he played poker?
13251,Lynette,"i love you, too, baby. here you go."
10694,Lynette,"he says he innocent. she believes him. if we say we don't, she'll just end up hating us."
9593,Lynette,i was thinking that our marriage was in trouble and one of us should do something to fix it.
12679,Lynette,"good luck. anne? when the baby comes, you don't contact porter. you can contact tom or me, and we'll do what we can for you from a distance. understood?"
13229,Lynette,"if you're really stopping by there, bring home some onion rings."
9478,Lynette,thank you. it looks like tom's got the mob under control. do you want to have some coffee? sit around? bitch about our kids?
12359,Lynette,"oh, i'm with gaby. i mean, you know me. i always like to give people the benefit of the doubt--"
10777,Lynette,"well, you're under a lot of stress. you got a new kid in the family. you're job hunting."
9483,Lynette,run by germans. hmm?
11885,Lynette,"no, i am. it's been months, and i have barely thought about what you're going through."
12761,Lynette,"and if porter doesn't show up for court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!"
9817,Lynette,"oh, i am so sorry."
11180,Lynette,but i'm his wife.
12639,Lynette,"oh, yeah, i'm great. that's it?"
10938,Lynette,"oh, yeah, i heard she isn't well. can i ask what's wrong with her?"
10229,Lynette,"uh-huh, and when were you there?because you forgot to list your dates of employment for that one."
9158,Lynette,"hello? oh, hey, susan. listen, i can't talk, i'm in the middle of something here. what?"
11827,Lynette,who do you think you're talking to?
13311,Lynette,i hardly think the kids are going to suffer without a clump of fur on their heads.
11420,Lynette,"look, i'll talk to tom--"
11416,Lynette,i'm sorry.
10140,Lynette,mm-hmm?
10903,Lynette,"i brought this on myself. i tell tom, i want you to be your own man.' but the truth is, i don't. i want him to have what he wants if it's what i want. i'm a bitch with a capital c."
11225,Lynette,"crap, that's ed."
9313,Lynette,"oh, you know it."
9055,Lynette,she sounds awful.
9856,Lynette,"thanks. hey, nina."
12231,Lynette,"rick, look. you know me. if tom had done something like this, do you really think i would protect him?"
10711,Lynette,i did. we need to find her another boyfriend and weddings are crawling with single men.
11781,Lynette,"oh! my god, you guys. i'm so touched you're all willing to do this."
12048,Lynette,"hi. did you hear they declared a tornado watch? scary, huh?"
11471,Lynette,you seem a little mopey lately. is everything okay?
13276,Lynette,"no, tom. we're having twins--again."
11913,Lynette,you're picking her over me?
9331,Lynette,"stop scratching. stop scratching. now, now, stop it. guys, let's go, okay? stop scratching. i mean it. stop, stop."
12197,Lynette,"yeah. no, he was here."
9913,Lynette,"see? that's where i think we have been making a terrible, terrible mistake."
9017,Lynette,sure. whatever.
12100,Lynette,but that's not where they found her.
12718,Lynette,hey.
11492,Lynette,thank you. so have you told bree about your engagement?
10683,Lynette,"ah hun, after the movies.movies than ice cream.an american tradition.so is something wrong?"
8729,Lynette,yeah! it's been a little rough!
8896,Lynette,there has been flirting.
11265,Lynette,"okay, just for that, you get to help me take out the trash. i know you think i'm being a hard-ass, but i'm just looking for a basic level of professionalism that--"
9059,Lynette,are you going to be here tomorrow? i want to see you again.
11392,Lynette,mrs. mccluskey. perfect timing.
13170,Lynette,"oh, would you stop with the book? you bought it at a car wash along with a pack of gum and an air freshener."
8875,Lynette,yes. completely identical. you can't tell them apart. they're like bookends.
12033,Lynette,oh. he seems nice.
11920,Lynette,liar. you're campaigning. cookies--nice touch.
12495,Lynette,i thought you were the one who said you wanted to spend more time with your family.
13262,Lynette,"okay, that's everyone."
12757,Lynette,porter--you have got to come home. everything will be fine. i promise.
9421,Lynette,"all right, enough. if you've got issues with your wife, tell her."
12858,Lynette,"if we do well, you get a cut of the profits. if we go belly-up, we liquidate, and you get the first $20,000. and then, of course, my family moves in with you. so--do we have a deal?"
11061,Lynette,that proves nothing. he knew i was on to him. he had to dump it someplace.
10348,Lynette,yeah.
10674,Lynette,"oh, i will, i will.and i'll see you tonight."
12736,Lynette,no!
12888,Lynette,"yes, i do. and the minute we're back on our feet, i am gonna pay back your investment--every penny, with interest."
12839,Lynette,who knew he had so many friends?
10075,Lynette,"this is communication. this is good. why don't you guys go down to the lobby, talk it out over some coffee?"
9673,Lynette,a girl. and three boys.
11859,Lynette,i'm upset 'cause that salesgirl just walked away with my sex life.
11980,Lynette,"ooh, look. the special is chicken. doesn't that sound good?"
12423,Lynette,"actually, it's 32."
10093,Lynette,gaby had an affair?
9103,Lynette,they're with the new nanny.
9072,Lynette,"i will give you a 20% bump on what she is paying you, plus overtime."
9281,Lynette,read the engraving.
11643,Lynette,"oh, dear god you didn't."
9159,Lynette,"okay, boys."
12714,Lynette,what am i supposed to do? where am i gonna get that bail money?
9467,Lynette,it does work. it does work most of the time.
9336,Lynette,"yeah, well, there's lots more where that came from."
11107,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey!"
10365,Lynette,sorry.
12948,Lynette,does she know you painted it?
8938,Lynette,"you're not human, are you? you were sent by aliens to make the human race feel inadequate."
8905,Lynette,why don't we just put them back in me and cook them until they're civilised?
10037,Lynette,"yeah. sure. i'll, i'm gonna go and take care of that."
8828,Lynette,how in the world did they?
12759,Lynette,"there is not a shred of evidence against you. when people see that, they will be on your side just like we are. sweetie, you have to trust me."
9521,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, we're going to be late for the doctor."
11563,Lynette,"so--what--well, how did you get here? i mean, you're not supposed to--drive."
13308,Lynette,you better not be apologizing for me!
12555,Lynette,oh. hi. what happened?
11990,Lynette,"hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
9696,Lynette,"um--t-- uh, v--and--uh-- radio--uh, billboards."
10045,Lynette,"see? all we need is a minimum participation of, uh--sixteen kids. my kids, your baby, sally in accounting has three, that new guy in human resources has two and we hit the mother lode with the mormon receptionist. she just popped out number six. there. sixteen."
10621,Lynette,"i don't..well, here goes."
11680,Lynette,"oh, good."
12330,Lynette,"again, i know i crossed the line, and i am so sorry."
10387,Lynette,"hey,hey,don't get me wrong.i find that as bizarreas you guys do.but right now this firm needs veronica more than she needs us.telling a mother how to raise her kids is an act of war.we will lose her."
9880,Lynette,"chuck, get your hand off my thigh. no! not up my thigh. off my thigh! come on, what's the matter with you! i'm not available. and i'm not that easy!"
10515,Lynette,"let me see.gaby,she's being deported.xiao-mei,is this the first letter like this you've received?"
9768,Lynette,"i know, i promised i wouldn't do this, but parker really needs me to be there on his first day of kindergarten. he's so freaked out i can't be there."
9830,Lynette,"hey, buddy. you busy?"
13248,Lynette,"i wanna be supportive. let's go for a nice dinner, get a bottle of wine--maybe two, since we don't have to wake up early tomorrow."
10431,Lynette,"do you know a rat can fit through a hole the size of a quarter?anyway,my children have that trick down,too."
10265,Lynette,i'm calling you out.
12809,Lynette,that's penny. i'll be right back.
11539,Lynette,"hey, you want some pizza?"
11083,Lynette,"thanks so much, rita. i think it's such a good idea that we all get together and talk and--wow."
8931,Lynette,"um, ladies. we all grew up with little red riding hood, and we survived it, scary stuff and all, so i say, to hell with political correctness, let our kids experience this classic like it was meant to be enjoyed. let's kill the damn wolf, and just put on the best show we can."
11092,Lynette,"excuse me, can you tell me what happened?"""
12114,Lynette,do you maybe want to say something first?
10680,Lynette,"oh, crap!"
9932,Lynette,oh.
12992,Lynette,"yeah, this isn't about that. um, i wanted to say i heard about carlos' g promotion. congratulations."
10816,Lynette,"not nicky, too!"
12513,Lynette,"look, bree--i think i know a little more about marketing than you do. when i was in it, i owned this town. i had every big account. hell, i was even named businesswoman of the year."
12470,Lynette,"toss it, and keep tossing until this 2-car garage can hold at least one car."
13001,Lynette,yep. thank you.
11470,Lynette,"hey, buddy, whatcha doing?"
9027,Lynette,"oh, susan, you gotta take my kids for a while."
11591,Lynette,thank you. this is nice.
9635,Lynette,"yep, that'll do it."
9325,Lynette,okay.
12731,Lynette,"bob, you've been going at this for over an hour. why don't we take a break?"
9402,Lynette,"only for first time guests. normally you'd be having, um, chicken fingers and cartoon shaped macaroni."
11305,Lynette,i switched the seven and the one.
9747,Lynette,i'm home.
10351,Lynette,"of you? no,i'm not."
8951,Lynette,"just being practical. isn't it better to settle this once and for all, rather than endure all this alpha mom crap until our kids graduate? hmmm? come on! i'll even let you take the first shot."
11038,Lynette,"hey, what's up?"
12449,Lynette,"aah, this is the kind of poetry that melts a girl's heart. so romantic. oh! here's a great one--""the lover tells of the rose in his heart."" my first boyfriend gave me this poem. i was a junior in"
12793,Lynette,"the ball game is going to end whether you like it or not. i would like to be here with you for whatever time you have left. but for that to happen, things have to change."
11668,Lynette,"i said that it was totally inappropriate, and then i fired him."
12698,Lynette,"okay, we're gonna talk about that later. you were saying?"
11391,Lynette,it's okay. i am gonna find a way to make this all work and you just get better.
9810,Lynette,"well, why didn't mrs. mulberry volunteer that information before i turned your room upside down looking for it, hmm?"
12149,Lynette,"yeah, and i hope the reverend's ready, cause i got about a zillion questions for him."
12188,Lynette,"gaby, since when do you come to price warehouse?"
12723,Lynette,that's because he's preston.
11986,Lynette,she's so not like that now.
12136,Lynette,"well, i decided i should go to church today. yeah, tom said the same thing. anyway, since you're the most religious person i know, i was wondering if you would take us to your church."
11797,Lynette,thanks for that encouraging story.
12310,Lynette,yeah. this woman is outta control.
9585,Lynette,what?
9934,Lynette,"yeah, okay, enough of that."
9094,Lynette,"all right. ""harvey: the flying turtle"". doesn't this look fun!"
9723,Lynette,and you didn't change them?
12598,Lynette,yeah?
9727,Lynette,of course it is.
12766,Lynette,porter?
10123,Lynette,so cute.'cause it's beautiful!
11661,Lynette,you had lunch with rick.
12113,Lynette,"hey, you've abetted. might as well aid."
10494,Lynette,"hey, any luckwith that i.m.ing thing?"
10311,Lynette,"hi.you,um,you recovered from all of yesterday's excitement?"
9470,Lynette,"yeah, yeah, i'm coming. what is it? why aren't you guys brushing your teeth? parker, what happened?"
9342,Lynette,#name?
9541,Lynette,"wow, things are really coming along."
10514,Lynette,"no,no,you should keep it."
9549,Lynette,"excuse me. i need to get in here,so i can clear the plates."
10258,Lynette,tell him you're done with the games.you don't wanna play anymore.
12536,Lynette,"yeah, that's immaterial. what do you think of the coupons?"
10803,Lynette,"i'm gonna go buy him an ice cream. it's okay, p-dog. you're gonna get 'em the next inning! so tell me, what else do you know about this nicky kid?"
10730,Lynette,you're right. you are right. you're right. i'm so sorry. it's just--
12866,Lynette,right. glad i thought of it.
10004,Lynette,"hey, stu."
10329,Lynette,i saw you!
10746,Lynette,"well, why don't you give them to the kids?"
11772,Lynette,"you are supposed to be distracting me, not depressing the hell out of me."
12806,Lynette,"it's not happening, tom."
8984,Lynette,i bet--can i use your bathroom?
12575,Lynette,how about the crazy married couple throwing drinks? how are they gonna be?
9967,Lynette,"yeah, well, that was a different time. you have to be more vigilant. there was a break-in on this street."
10586,Lynette,"no, dad is not gonna be there, but he--he is gonna come and see you guys all the time.we are still gonna be a family.it's just-- we won't be living in the same place anymore.so--is there any questions you wanna ask me?"
9937,Lynette,"norma, wait! we're still on for next week! norma! the water park! right?"
9678,Lynette,okay.
11055,Lynette,parker!
11516,Lynette,"oh, my god. how do you botch a bikini wax?"
12448,Lynette,is that my yeats book? i love his poetry.
9887,Lynette,i'll just wear a different suit then.
9279,Lynette,"my kids have been on kind of a thieving jag, stealing stuff from around the neighborhood."
12022,Lynette,"once she shows up, you'll meet her and give her the money. then ask her to walk you back to the car. i'll jump out, grab her, and while you open the trunk--"
12625,Lynette,"okay, that's it. i'm calling her."
13016,Lynette,"$100,000 a year."
11614,Lynette,i don't know what you're talking about. there's nothing to admit.
9432,Lynette,"well, yeah!"
13007,Lynette,"it matters because i'm only 43, and i look like i'm 39."
9559,Lynette,keep your voice down!
13154,Lynette,"sorry. just had the handyman in here, but he's finished. thank you, handyman."
10968,Lynette,he's a bachelor.
9130,Lynette,good morning.
11796,Lynette,i get it. you're uncomfortable. just go. i'm fine. i'm fine.
12778,Lynette,okay. i know you're mad. i know we have a lot to hash out between us. but don't take your hate for me out on your grandson. now where is he?
13303,Lynette,"hell, yeah.first, i want you to touch yourself."
12221,Lynette,"hey, andrew. what do you need?"
11114,Lynette,she didn't seem that knocked out by it.
9190,Lynette,"oh, really? why?"
12091,Lynette,"wow, the things you accumulate in a lifetime, huh?"
8764,Lynette,goodbye.
9842,Lynette,oh.
8773,Lynette,"well, my kids aren't normal, and now i don't have time for this, lady, so. boys! get out here."
11641,Lynette,"well, scott, i'm not sure i would say, particularly not to someone i just met."
10225,Lynette,great! great!
12672,Lynette,we're going to protect our son.
11507,Lynette,"well, of course they don't. they're kids. you're the dad. make 'em."
10167,Lynette,thought about who i'd marry if you died?hmm. no.
13307,Lynette,i'll see you at home.
11722,Lynette,you can't stay if i don't want you here.
10519,Lynette,"well,fran found out that ed didn't send them,and she blew her top.she wants the responsible party fired,and ed lied and told her--that you sent them."
9300,Lynette,oh.
12112,Lynette,"well, here's the thing. i called the general manager to ask if we could scatter the ashes here, and he said absolutely not."
11857,Lynette,"yeah, and showers aren't just about presents. they're fun."
8991,Lynette,"well, maybe you need better ideas. i'm sorry-i'm sorry, i didn't mean that."
9232,Lynette,"no, he's not."
10042,Lynette,does he know yet?
8957,Lynette,did he say anything about his mother's suicide?
11895,Lynette,"see, this is one of the upsides of having cancer. you get to excuse yourself from petty neighborhood squabbles."
9975,Lynette,what if the stranger is nice and not scary? yes?
11160,Lynette,why not?
12121,Lynette,oh!
10197,Lynette,"uh, well, i rewrote some of the stuff we worked on,but, you know, essentially, it's the same, and they ate it up."
8698,Lynette,"no, you are going to behave today. i am not going to be humiliated in front of the entire neighborhood. and, just so you know how serious i am--"
9938,Lynette,"they need to know we don't judge them for what they do in the privacy of their own home. and, well, it's not unheard of to tape yourself while you're having sex."
10271,Lynette,you okay?
11123,Lynette,"well, that's true, but she's sad."
9104,Lynette,"well, trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be. you know, our mothers were smart. they didn't get us nannies or put us in day care, because they knew, if they did, we'd find out - there are other women out there who were better mothers than they were!"
9828,Lynette,hi.
12765,Lynette,"uh, is everything okay?"
11266,Lynette,austin? what the hell's going on here?
10795,Lynette,"hey, did i tell you that, uh, burnham fox is looking for a new creative director?"
13163,Lynette,"oh, okay. uh, coffee will be fine."
11806,Lynette,"we should go, too. get a few drinks in her, see if she loosens up."
13169,Lynette,"tom, you're being completely irrational. we've had sex 23 days straight. i've seen more ceiling than michelangelo."
12338,Lynette,have a seat. i'll be with you in a second.
9814,Lynette,"so, what did parker do?"
10788,Lynette,"all right, let's try it again. nice and easy. watch the ball hit the bat. you ready? you can do it. here we go. okay, parker, i keep telling you, you gotta keep your eyes open. how are you gonna hit the ball when you're doing this?"
12580,Lynette,"so funny. i was gonna ask you the same question. but i was gonna start with ""what the hell?"""
12734,Lynette,that's why we've been trying to get you to postpone the hearing date until we could find him.
13283,Lynette,"what, a nanny cam?"
10631,Lynette,"if she takes you to court, we'll lose and end up paying 11 years of child support all at once. we could lose the house."
10793,Lynette,"yeah, well, that's not the point.what kind of message are we sending if we let him quit whenever the going gets rough?"
11082,Lynette,"oh, i'm not taking sides."
9220,Lynette,we're not done here.
12987,Lynette,"so was it a good, old-fashioned american kiss or are we talking the infinitely superior french variety?"
11321,Lynette,"well, we've been going there for the last seven years. it's not exactly a surprise. anyway, i hope you don't mind, but i canceled."
11566,Lynette,oh. it must be the basil. it has a kind of sweet smell.
10076,Lynette,we've got day care!
9912,Lynette,"you can't explain obsession, tom. it just is."
9195,Lynette,"porter, don't you dare look at me like that. i will wipe that smirk right off your face. and don't think that i won't--"
10825,Lynette,this is all my fault. why punish parker?
12811,Lynette,oh. i wish you'd caught me two chardonnays ago.
12480,Lynette,"ooh! careful, honey."
12060,Lynette,"oh. sorry. kinda get used to it. come here. give that to mama. hey, guys? come on now. knock it off. here you go. and-- first base, second base, third base, sit. we gonna have a nice, quiet tornado watch, and nobody's gonna cause any problems."
10852,Lynette,i think-- i'm gonna open another bottle of wine.
8840,Lynette,i used to run a company with 85 people and now i can't wrangle three small boys without doping them. talk about feeling like a failure.
11890,Lynette,"thanks, sweetheart. hello. oh, yeah. hi, dr. shiller. okay, that's my white blood count. uh-huh, but as long as it's higher than 4.0, that means i don't have neutropenia, right? well, that's great. thanks for calling. yeah, you, too. bye."
10285,Lynette,hi.is now a bad time?i could really use a favor.
13287,Lynette,could you hold her?
13197,Lynette,"tom, men don't need plastic surgery. they look better as they age."
12614,Lynette,"yeah, at this point, i think i'm gonna need a little bit more than that."
11124,Lynette,eat your tacos.
10322,Lynette,"no.i'm worried about her,but i don't know how i'm gonna get over what she did."
10858,Lynette,why?
9312,Lynette,"yep, it's all about the window."
12407,Lynette,"you do! this is tom, former high school nerd, living viciously through his awesome-ass kids."
13089,Lynette,all right.
12202,Lynette,"okay. i know this whole thing with rick-- it really caused us some damage. i know it hurt us, but we survived it, and it's over now."
11429,Lynette,"is that why you apologized, just so i'd-- service you?"
8874,Lynette,"oh,that sounds great."
10537,Lynette,that doesn't make any sense.there's gotta be some kind of an explanation for this.
12704,Lynette,"well, i try."
11263,Lynette,i feel nothing.
10328,Lynette,"oh,please.i live with you.last night, when you should've been trying to make that pitch work,you were watching the game."
11423,Lynette,"well, you might also want to apologize to the customer who found a lego in her pizza."
11970,Lynette,"we need to talk about this stan thing. oh, is that his name? stan?"
8715,Lynette,"that's right, get over here. go, go, go, ugh. move it. out. get out."
11065,Lynette,"he'd gotten rid of everything--the toys, the pictures, everything was gone."
10638,Lynette,really?
8723,Lynette,"yeah, well."
10503,Lynette,hey there.did you have a late night?i hope.
11432,Lynette,i will be right there!
9557,Lynette,what's wrong with subtly reminding annabel that you're happily married?
9638,Lynette,tom?
9804,Lynette,here we go.
12854,Lynette,and so do you. and i'm gonna feel real crappy when you unwrap your lavender bath beads.
9776,Lynette,"honey, i'm gonna be right back."
11995,Lynette,i don't have any room for her. i already have seven people in four bedrooms.
9755,Lynette,"hey, guys!"
9603,Lynette,"tom, what is this?"
9601,Lynette,tucked in tight.
9540,Lynette,"edie, hi."
10250,Lynette,"pat, we're all here, send the call in as soon as you get it."
11414,Lynette,"no, i know, but i've got a really good feeling about this guy, and all he wants is a fresh start."
12695,Lynette,like why do the police have a witness?
11998,Lynette,"i really wanna meet this jackass. okay, we all have our excuses, but we gotta figure something out. come on. she is our mother."
13255,Lynette,i'm sure it wasn't that bad.
9121,Lynette,okay.
10139,Lynette,i-- don't.i really don't.
11720,Lynette,stop comparing us. i never did what you did.
11548,Lynette,"okay, okay, she's circling the park."
10672,Lynette,"shhh, shh, quiet, shush!"
11299,Lynette,"i shouldn't have to tell you every little thing, you know. show some initiative."
12463,Lynette,"hey. mind if i join you? okay, i know what i did--was unforgivable. and i am not trying to make excuses, but--we used to talk all the time, and then one day it just stopped, and it killed me. i felt like i lost you. and then i was saraj, and i had you back, and we were talking again, and you were telling me thin."
10710,Lynette,"oh, i'm working on a seating chart for bree's wedding."
10406,Lynette,"wow,that is--really a bummer."
12180,Lynette,"well, i-- i've got some work to do."
13125,Lynette,"hey, is this gorgonzola?"
12499,Lynette,"well, back before i consecrated my life to mozzarella, marketing was sort of what i did."
10409,Lynette,"well,it makes sense,i guess."
11191,Lynette,"come on, harry. you are my last holdout. what's it gonna take? cash? uh, free pizza for the rest of your life? you name it."
13258,Lynette,that's--a brilliant plan. why didn't you tell me this?
12822,Lynette,my hero.
12333,Lynette,hi.
9612,Lynette,what?
9488,Lynette,"yeah, i'll come with you. here i am."
12912,Lynette,"all right, that's a large mushroom pepperoni pizza and two salads. i'll get that started. tom, i got need a large---"
11419,Lynette,"okay, i know that, uh, tom has been a little cranky lately."
11936,Lynette,it feels like i've ruined their childhood.
12187,Lynette,"yeah, it's back."
8713,Lynette,here.
12899,Lynette,"if you're looking to get fed, it's gonna be a while."
9630,Lynette,"yes, a very pretty shark."
12617,Lynette,i think-- i have to sit down now.
10044,Lynette,"we have day care, ed, day care. do you realize that since we fired half the staff, you and i have barely left the building? my kids are forgetting who i am."
13211,Lynette,i wanted you to see the face they don't put in the brochure.
13006,Lynette,"he didn't even flinch. i said i was 54, and he bought it. there was not a ""wow, you look great for your age!"" not even a courtesy gasp."
11379,Lynette,three months?
13191,Lynette,meaning you were in the same class at the same time?
8993,Lynette,"tom, i am sorry about tonight. truly, but these days, if i'm competing with anyone, it's the bree van de kamps of the world with their spotless kitchens, and their perfect kids, who throw fabulous parties where nothing ever goes wrong. i try so hard to keep up, but i can't."
10564,Lynette,yeah?you're quite a gambler.where's jerry?
8745,Lynette,"that would be fun. paul, we have proof your wife killed herself over some deep dark secret. another ??"
11724,Lynette,what did the doctors say?
12553,Lynette,"yes, but daddy's gonna live to a ripe old age unless he doesn't get home in time for mrs. mccluskey's party, and then all bets are off. oh, daddy's gonna be fine. come on."
12557,Lynette,oh. is he--
12657,Lynette,hitting women and children? you must be so proud.
10462,Lynette,no.
8968,Lynette,"no, no. let's, let's do it."
12297,Lynette,so we were sort of surprised to get your call. don't you need to see kayla a few more times before you report back to us?
11259,Lynette,"when i got shot and i was lying there bleeding, i wasn't thinking ""god, i'm really gonna miss advertising."" i think this could be the best thing that's ever happened to our family. we can make our own hours, we'll be together more, and, yes, the money is gonna be a little tight, but i think this place could be a gold mine."
11175,Lynette,what?
9971,Lynette,okay.
9194,Lynette,"--okay, your 30 seconds is up now. get back here, get back here, get back here. i want the toys picked up. how many times do i have to tell you, pick up your toys! you want a spanking? is that what you want?"
11631,Lynette,"well, daddy probably didn't notice that i was unloading twenty-pound bags of flour 'cause he still can't lift them, so mommy didn't exactly have time to sit around and chew the fat."
13112,Lynette,fine. i should've just had sex. i'd be asleep by now.
10408,Lynette,i heard about that.andrew's asking to be emancipated?
9852,Lynette,"oh, for god's sakes."
10154,Lynette,"oh,you've gotta be kidding!i have to get back to work!"
12173,Lynette,meh.
10143,Lynette,what's that about?
12507,Lynette,"well, they overshot and wound up in ""bland,"" right on the border of ""sucky."" you need to grab your audience, just grab 'em. i've gone for jazzier colors, bolder fonts. oh, i have really played up the whole nostalgia angle."
10156,Lynette,okay.
11351,Lynette,are you speaking as my husband or as my boss?
9681,Lynette,okay. come on. give me your feet.
10849,Lynette,"no, that was a real frisbee to the head, that one."
9915,Lynette,carbon--fiber--shafts.
10399,Lynette,"oh,i'm sorry,honey.your mom-- is in her office on a conference call,and she's busy,so you're just gonna have to wait,okay?"
10165,Lynette,so you're saying that if i died--you would want a second wife and a family?
10596,Lynette,i don't care what her name is.
10323,Lynette,it feels a little familiar.
9026,Lynette,turn that damn thing off.
11543,Lynette,"trust me, we can both relax. i talked to her this morning, and she's out with victor all day."
11072,Lynette,i'm not sad. he shouldn't be around kids. i saw those pictures.
11150,Lynette,hi.
10763,Lynette,"all right, all right, all right, all right. i'm pulling over! jeez! what the hell are you doing?!"
9282,Lynette,i don't know.
9803,Lynette,"hello, mrs. mulberry. don't forget to buckle up."
9284,Lynette,i needed you to see something.they said they stole it from mike's garage.
8702,Lynette,let's get this over with.
11323,Lynette,"i'm exhausted. honestly, all i wanna do is pawn the kids off on somebody else, take a long bath and be in bed by eight."
9171,Lynette,"well, yeah, i know it hurts, but that's what you get when you let your brothers put bubble gum in your hair. pain and misery."
8717,Lynette,"tom, this is my 5th message and you still haven't called me back. well, you must be having a lot of fun on your business trip. i can only imagine. well, guess what, the kids and i wanna have some fun too, so unless you call me back by noon, we are getting on a plane and joining you."
11312,Lynette,"okay, okay, we could point fingers, but what's important is forgetting about what we expected, and focusing on what we have, which isn't so bad. i mean, all the different kinds of chairs give the place a kind of bohemian vibe. plus, if we get a lot of babies, look, we're just totally set. tom, i'm sorry. i am. i'm sorry. i just, i realize it's not perfect. but--please say something."
13119,Lynette,"oh, well, i appreciate that. and here's something else i'd appreciate--could we not tell anyone else about this?"
11032,Lynette,"he doesn't care about the cake, tom."
10014,Lynette,i'm lynette scavo. i work here. who are you?
13015,Lynette,"i--don't know. well, he'd have to match my current offer."
12988,Lynette,"well, that doesn't make any difference. right, lee?"
13263,Lynette,"this is lynette scavo. may i please speak to dr. rushton? tell him it's important. dr. rushton, i need to come in and see you as soon as possible. i think the cancer's back."
10965,Lynette,"no, you're not. i can tell. please-- tell me what's wrong. let me save you."
11362,Lynette,except we're never home. we live here. our marriage happens here.
11734,Lynette,"hey,sweetie,what's up?"
12777,Lynette,"no, no. we have this great lawyer. he thinks he can get the case thrown out."
12565,Lynette,"and when i was 12, i had a poster of shaun cassidy, but you don't see me driving around in him, do you?"
12089,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
9516,Lynette,first thing tomorrow i'll take you to the pharmacy and you can get you new bottles.
9437,Lynette,"lily, we're coming back."
12316,Lynette,"well, i know, but we're supposed to be spending time together, not going into debt. oh. how about this one?"
10300,Lynette,you were sleeping?
12832,Lynette,"oh, mr. swenson, i can't tell you how excited i am. maybe you could schedule a staff meeting so i could hit the ground running on monday. no, no. no, it can't be friday, because, remember, we agreed that we would start next week? so again, thank you so much for this opportunity."
12015,Lynette,"oh, god. only three decades give or take a year, but who cares? oh, gosh. you look great."
8861,Lynette,mary alice was not crazy.
11552,Lynette,"well, edie hired me to cater, so it's just business. i don't know what her excuse is."
12891,Lynette,"when times get tough, people do without things like pizza."
10342,Lynette,stop right there.this is meat loaf. your presentation was business.
9631,Lynette,hello?
10643,Lynette,"like, five minutes from here arden drive?"
12239,Lynette,"come here. come on. okay. mommy and daddy are sort of-- fighting, but we're working through it."
10721,Lynette,all of them? what about jerry? jerry's fun.
10687,Lynette,"no, i'm not telling."
13241,Lynette,"uh. we didn't get that far. i felt faint, and he left to go buy a backpack."
11441,Lynette,i can't do this. it's just--
12486,Lynette,hey.
13246,Lynette,coming. i'm coming.
10033,Lynette,why? what happened?
12103,Lynette,"um, well, there's a great diner right near granville field."
9553,Lynette,"hold on, honey, grown ups are talking."
8846,Lynette,why? we unloaded a lot on you.
12958,Lynette,he's being modest. he was the best.
11814,Lynette,yeah.
9757,Lynette,school supplies.
11753,Lynette,i don't want to hear it.
11187,Lynette,did you live in las vegas?
12885,Lynette,"i know you don't, but five years ago, you would've."
10337,Lynette,"oh,right,i was talking to susan on the phone,and i left it in a little longer than i should've. sorry."
13278,Lynette,absolutely.
12241,Lynette,"yes, of course."
10597,Lynette,then why are you going to atlantic city every other weekend to visit her?
12850,Lynette,what's this?
10781,Lynette,maybe?
12084,Lynette,why is it taking so long? they should be going faster.
10585,Lynette,"guys?could you come here for a second?we need to have a serious talk. okay, we have had a great-- vacation, but tomorrow we're going home, except we're not going to our home. we're gonna go stay with grandma."
12905,Lynette,"tom, what the hell are you talking about?"
12999,Lynette,you think i'm a big risk?
10444,Lynette,"oh,it doesn't.i'm just stalling because i am completely mortified."
9743,Lynette,okay.
10433,Lynette,no.
13249,Lynette,"oh, tom. you and tequila? what a great idea."
10216,Lynette,thank you. bye.
10414,Lynette,"good.because when i give my deposition,i'm goingto tell the truth."
8952,Lynette,"yeah, i didn't think so. and just so you know, next spring when we do bambi, his mother is going to take a slug to the heart, and you're going to like it!"
8758,Lynette,"no, no."
12290,Lynette,"he's gonna hang out and watch us, you know, be a family."
13091,Lynette,maybe they did. anybody seen any dead squirrels around here?
9795,Lynette,and you don't find it odd that parker's new nanny made her appearance right at the time i went back to work?
10011,Lynette,great!
10824,Lynette,huh?
10591,Lynette,"no, no!"
11327,Lynette,let it go--that's cute. start talkin'.
8884,Lynette,you're going to have some fun today.
12577,Lynette,and i had cancer. i get it. i get it. you want your life to count for something.
12670,Lynette,i'm telling you i heard him threaten warren schilling. i don't know what happened next.
11164,Lynette,"hey, you banned me from your opening."
9222,Lynette,because i kicked him out of the house.
10073,Lynette,"no, and you're gonna get her back a whole lot faster if you will just listen to me. okay? listen, and you? all right, good. so, first of all, ed, stealing the baby was really stupid."
11713,Lynette,"i think at a certain point, people just are who they are."
11604,Lynette,"i'm sorry. i would've called, but they took our cell phones before they locked us in there."
11825,Lynette,that's me! the ninja!
11576,Lynette,yeah.
11004,Lynette,"i'm only gonna be in there ten minutes, i promise."
9261,Lynette,you know what? this has been fun but now -
11875,Lynette,"brandy's history, tom. let her go."
11240,Lynette,"you haven't heard? he has been begging gaby to go on a date with him. he's been sending her all sorts of stuff to bribe her, even a diamond bracelet."
11368,Lynette,"exactly, and i'm supposed to wear that every damn day."
12443,Lynette,you're probably right. it's just--did you know porter writes poetry?
11313,Lynette,i'm happy for you.
13223,Lynette,"tom, why didn't you help me out there?"
10465,Lynette,excuse me?
10464,Lynette,"oh-- that was me.he was asking about the birds and the bees, and i fudged a few of the details."
12620,Lynette,what are you talking about?
9822,Lynette,"tom, he attacked a teacher with an umbrella."
9771,Lynette,"not now, stu. hang on a sec."
10551,Lynette,"tom, it would be better for your general well-being if you did not laugh at this moment in time."
12029,Lynette,"okay, enough with the drama. i want you to come home with me."
12059,Lynette,"hey, we're here!"
12823,Lynette,"jeff cuevas is fantastic, but i know i could take his department to a whole new level."
12618,Lynette,you know what? i have to kill you now.
13247,Lynette,so i was thinking this whole going back to school thing deserves a little celebration.
12654,Lynette,thanks.
10362,Lynette,ew.
9498,Lynette,now's not a good time. i'm on my way out and i have a tonne of errands.
12615,Lynette,huh?
13236,Lynette,wh-what's that now?
13266,Lynette,"if it's cancer, and i find out you knew, i won't be dying alone."
8914,Lynette,i'm not surprised that he's playing it close to the vest. paul knows we're on to him.
9660,Lynette,"oh, i have a thousand things to do before that. borrow a decent scarf from bree, buy a lipstick i don't hate."
9175,Lynette,"and it's frustrating for me too, 'cause i do want to be the best mommy i can be."
11526,Lynette,"oh, really? my ringer must've been off."
9945,Lynette,"so, um, we've been trying to contact you, but you haven't been returning any of our messages."
11365,Lynette,i'm going home.
11987,Lynette,okay. okay. okay. good for you. i'm sorry.
11717,Lynette,"hey, glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest in my life. you didn't care about that, though, did you? you just drove him away."
10897,Lynette,"oh, i know them. they live on cypress. they just celebrated their fifty-third wedding anniversary."
11127,Lynette,she is special. now sit down. come on.
10530,Lynette,"okay,go get him."
11344,Lynette,"jeez,are you crying?"
10562,Lynette,hello?
11086,Lynette,i'm sorry. i thought we were all gonna talk about how to keep an eye on this guy.
8979,Lynette,'dana.' where did this come from?
12052,Lynette,yeah.
10892,Lynette,i suckered mccluskey into taking the kids for a while so i could kick back and catch up with my old friend margarita. you care to join us?
11513,Lynette,"those, too."
11244,Lynette,there you go. great. guess what? our line is the biggest one at the fair. i counted. you know what i'm starting to think?
11206,Lynette,"gambling with our life savings and not asking for help doesn't make you a man.it makes you an idiot. come on,tom,for god sakes, we are a team, and that restaurant is a huge undertaking. no one could do it alone."
11141,Lynette,"guys, how would you like to eat dinner in front of the television for a whole week?"
11961,Lynette,"this is not a joke, tom. something has attacked our home, and when that happens, you don't just stand by-- you fight it. screw this creature that has come into our lives uninvited and is trying to destroy us. it will not defeat me."
11060,Lynette,"hey, hey! where have you been?"
12204,Lynette,but-- nothing ever happened between us. you have to believe me. come on!
9625,Lynette,"no, no, not me. i was actually thinking more about tom."
11110,Lynette,"hey,look at that. preston gave you a harmonica. isn't that cool? oh ""harriet the spy."" sounds mysterious."
10394,Lynette,"hey,you know,breast-feeding on this schedule must be a real hassle.i remember i used to express my milk into a bottle.made my life so much easier."
9101,Lynette,"where is she, by the way? i haven't seen her in days."
10761,Lynette,"oh, lighten up. it's a joke."
10259,Lynette,but--
9536,Lynette,"no, i wanted to see you."
8775,Lynette,"well, bring 'em, we're leaving."
12240,Lynette,"oh, something he did that made mommy really mad."
9109,Lynette,bye.
9941,Lynette,norma--
11483,Lynette,"oh, yeah. i gotcha."
12562,Lynette,but it doesn't matter because you're not dying.
12257,Lynette,kayla--why would you even joke about something like that?
9622,Lynette,yeah.
10957,Lynette,"yeah, yes, i will, i will, i will. i will love her like she is my own. i will, nora. nora? nora!"
11579,Lynette,i don't mind.
11422,Lynette,"okay, everybody, go on up to bed. parker, you got the baby. yeah, that's exactly right. you know what to do."
10540,Lynette,anything else going on?
10030,Lynette,"hey, pat, what's going on?"
12523,Lynette,"well, it's really my husband's. and i'm still doing some freelance stuff."
10373,Lynette,"word is out all over town that you're unhappy at zimms,so why not jump ship and come to parcher & murphy?i swear, veronica,you would fit in so well here."
9046,Lynette,so i can poach me one.
10737,Lynette,ummm.
9616,Lynette,"actually, it's fruit juice sweetened. can i cut you? a piece?"
10246,Lynette,you've only been here a week.yhy don't you give yourself a break?
12215,Lynette,you go alone?
9588,Lynette,fine.
9977,Lynette,you're smiling like that actually meant something.
12283,Lynette,get up. up.
10052,Lynette,"really? yeah. look, i'm gonna level with you. parcher and murphy can't have a day care center unless we have at least sixteen kids and without little mindy, we only have fifteen."
12687,Lynette,"no. sweetie, i don't."
9435,Lynette,"alisa, come here."
10254,Lynette,"just for one second, okay?just for one second.hey,i never thought i'd have to ask you this,but are you about to eat a doughnut out of the toilet?"
13135,Lynette,i got it. i'll be right up.
13020,Lynette,"yeah. yeah, that gaby's a real class act."
8756,Lynette,"here's, uh, here's what i pulled for edie. i should warn you, most of the clothes in there aren't that stylish."
13077,Lynette,how do you think?
8724,Lynette,"well, to be honest--"
11837,Lynette,you drugged me.
11375,Lynette,"hello?hi.there's something wrong with my husband. i don't know. he's unconscious. 357 hawthorne place. okay, could you please hurry? thank you. yes."
11474,Lynette,"oh, sure!"

12169,Lynette,huh. that's nice of you.
12302,Lynette,"of course i do--as much as i can, given the way she joined our family. it's just--it's complicated."
11925,Lynette,"fascism, ida, not fashion."
9639,Lynette,"tom, what are you doing?"
9563,Lynette,she's in the next room.
10287,Lynette,oh.i'm sorry.hang on.hello?
9268,Lynette,i'm not going over there.
12469,Lynette,"i know. you get winded just climbing out of the tub. you're never gonna climb a mountain. you know what else you're never gonna do? learn german, make your own beer or--have 8 minute abs."
9476,Lynette,now go brush your teeth and i want them to sparkle. go on.
10954,Lynette,you are gonna get through this just fine. there is a parking lot full of ambulances out there. you gotta let us take her out of here!
12314,Lynette,mnh-mnh.
11568,Lynette,but--i'm sorry. you could still go.
11696,Lynette,"no! i am not leaving that woman in charge of our children. in three months, the twins will be chain-smoking, and penny will be an alcoholic. we can manage. we've got mccluskey."
11748,Lynette,hi!how are you?
12141,Lynette,it'll just take a sec.
13095,Lynette,"wait. there wouldn't happen to be actual gardeners in this club, would they?"
11260,Lynette,i can do that.
9933,Lynette,"yeah, um, before that happens--"
11079,Lynette,"hey, why don't we start that girl talk?"
11619,Lynette,"oh, jeez. what choice do i have?"
10248,Lynette,"well,tom, why don't you pitch him the other idea you came up with last night?you know, the one where people love bacon so much they wanna keep it a secret?"
10363,Lynette,"yeah,yeah.gotta love the thunderbolt."
8793,Lynette,i already got a sitter.
10459,Lynette,i'm home.
12537,Lynette,"oh. i know. you've got your book and--and your big fancy award, and i'm just a housewife."
10104,Lynette,"yeah. hey, gaby.a surprise seeing you here."
8736,Lynette,let's risk it?
12974,Lynette,"you know, tom, you're right. bruce does care about this job. that's why he wants to make sure he gets the perfect person for it."
9334,Lynette,"yeah, here. see? it's this little white thing. look. it looks like a --"
9976,Lynette,"so, what if the stranger says they're gonna take you to the circus for pizza and elephant rides? don't look at your dad. eyes on me. what are you gonna do? what are you gonna do?"
12685,Lynette,what?
12306,Lynette,"hey, honey, could you get that? thank you."
10396,Lynette,"yeah,well,in the third world,they don't have juice boxes."

11549,Lynette,"oh, yeah, i'm more terrified of gaby. okay, good, good. we're almost home free--"
10249,Lynette,go.
12259,Lynette,but it doesn't matter! intentionally setting a fire is a very serious crime. don't you get that?
12335,Lynette,"for what it's worth, i keep my floors incredibly clean."
10174,Lynette,with a vasec to me.
11205,Lynette,why haven't you told me about all of this?
12098,Lynette,"you realize we're cleaning, right? we're not eating candy."
9380,Lynette,"just so you know, i got topher a set of bongo drums. i know you'll love them as much as he will."
11583,Lynette,yeah. i think firing him would be a huge mistake.
10720,Lynette,"hey, look at you. miss popular. so, you having a good time over there?"
9060,Lynette,i just want to talk.
11067,Lynette,he's a bachelor who lives with his invalid sister.
13093,Lynette,"so who can come by later and check on him? i'd do it, but i'm working late."
11903,Lynette,that sounds like a no.
10883,Lynette,"okay.okay, here's what we're going to do. you said there were multiple offers, so we can sublease. now let's get the hell out of here."
12923,Lynette,what's going on here?

13238,Lynette,25 years after the first time.
10106,Lynette,no.
9229,Lynette,"no, he should never have been with her in the first place!"
9951,Lynette,that is a damn shame.
12865,Lynette,i don't know what to say.
12181,Lynette,that's you?
13269,Lynette,are you sure it's not cancer?
9253,Lynette,"all right, start with 'dear mrs. mccluskey.'"
11926,Lynette,"it's up to you, hon."
10662,Lynette,you move fast.
10175,Lynette,"look,it makes perfect sense.we're not gonna have any more kids.and the pill just makes me bloat.it'll be great!"
8983,Lynette,"hey, word on the street is that you've been medicating timmy--"
9102,Lynette,oh. well. good luck with that.
12590,Lynette,hum.
8880,Lynette,what is a must-meet list?
11967,Lynette,"i have to get checked every six months, but, yes, the doctor is very optimistic."
9811,Lynette,"no! i'm not going to get the damn umbrella! i'm so sorry, sweetie. i am not mad at you."
10401,Lynette,"follow me.here. go ahead,try it.come on,you'll really like it.i promise.come on,yeah.all the grown-ups are drinking it.yeah,that's good.just-- chug it on down.good.you like that?"
9001,Lynette,woo. that stuff is strong!
8782,Lynette,i know. preston used the three of diamonds to scoop jam out of the jar.
11608,Lynette,good night. come again.
10668,Lynette,so what are you saying?you're more afraid of nora that you are of me?
13182,Lynette,and what'd you say?
10579,Lynette,"let's suppose your husband begged you to get pregnant-- begged you--and out of the goodness of your heart, you agreed, even though it might derail your career.you agreed to a baby.a baby, singular."
9509,Lynette,"six months from now when they find her mummified corpse at the bottom of the stairs what do i tell the kids? oh yeah, i let mrs mcclusky die."
11880,Lynette,"yeah, because i'm bald. and i know that that's a big old turnoff, but, you know, i can't help it."
12753,Lynette,"you see that bar? warren schilling goes there every night. all right, come on! tonight, when he leaves--i'm gonna do what i have to, to make sure my family is safe. so--i need you to get out now. you can't be in the car when this happens."
10727,Lynette,they are just two random people who met at a wedding. can't pin it on me.
9505,Lynette,alright. okay. thank you.
9052,Lynette,"claire? i've always loved that name. so claire--"" ""do you come here often?"
9238,Lynette,"and just so we're absolutely clear, i am definitely not your mother, because if you ever betray me, i will leave you. i will take the kids, and i will walk out that door, and you will never see any of us again."
11611,Lynette,that's funny. he didn't mention it.
8872,Lynette,it really doesn't.
10179,Lynette,you're not limping.did everything go okay?
9508,Lynette,but if i'm wrong then i'm sucked into a two-hour conversation about bunions pilkingtons.
13005,Lynette,i'm 54.
12633,Lynette,"so do i. and if you ever lay a hand on him again, you will find out just how much."
12102,Lynette,at about the rest of these boxes?
12219,Lynette,"no, no. of course not. it's just, if the police came here to ask us about the brick, they're probably gonna ask us about the fire, so you might wanna be ready."
11428,Lynette,"but you can't bend at the waist, and that pretty much leaves the heavy lifting to me."
9835,Lynette,"no, can't say that i have."
12680,Lynette,who's that?
12044,Lynette,it does. it really does.
11264,Lynette,i told you i wanted this floor to sparkle like your mom's.now does this floor look bree hodge clean to you?
9042,Lynette,"i know. and i know we can't afford it. and i know everything that's happened is my fault. but, if i don't get some help, there's an excellent chance, i will lose my mind."
8794,Lynette,i was looking so forward to a night out.
12824,Lynette,"oh, my water broke. take the overnight bag out to the car. oh, three weeks. that's a little soon, but, uh, sure, i could make that work."
9682,Lynette,how's that? is that better?
9257,Lynette,"hey, what do you think you are doing? get out of here."
10771,Lynette,"and you think that's easy? okay, i have a good life. yes, yes, i am very lucky, but i work twelve hours a day, and then i come home to what seems like thirty three children, and husband who refuses to get a job. and believe me, there is not a supermom out there who wouldn't trade in her cape, for a chance to read a book and get a massage by a man who has the decency to leave when it's over."
13275,Lynette,"actually, i have an addendum to that."
13157,Lynette,oh. didn't we already do it tonight?
9106,Lynette,oh! sorry.
11898,Lynette,you're comparing katherine to a nazi?
12630,Lynette,"but if you don't end this, you won't have to leave. we will throw you out."
11922,Lynette,"pay for a fence you don't even want. that's not how you make good neighbors, and i don't care if--"
9845,Lynette,"because of me, my son's imaginary friend got crushed by a garbage truck. i am the worst person in the world."
10783,Lynette,tell me something i don't know.
10088,Lynette,me neither.
11804,Lynette,"hello? oh, hey, bree. mm, what's up?"
10797,Lynette,"look, i was just making conversation. batter up!"
11687,Lynette,"but, honey--"
8749,Lynette,i have a theory.
11246,Lynette,here you go.
11674,Lynette,stop. just--stop. what is it you think i have?
12409,Lynette,but i told them they couldn't go.
12763,Lynette,"i am so happy for you, but we're gonna miss you."
12235,Lynette,excuse me?
9343,Lynette,"it's been one day, and they've been disinvited to a birthday party. if rumors start flying, these boys can kiss campouts and pool parties goodbye."
12362,Lynette,hey. you know what we haven't done in a really long time? made 250 mini pizzas in one afternoon.
9039,Lynette,then what?
12645,Lynette,damn it.
13118,Lynette,uh-huh. which means you saw me--
11799,Lynette,you're not gonna lose me.
11618,Lynette,"yeah, i'm mad! i am mad because i loved our nights together. it made me feel sexy and happy, and, god, how i needed that. and now it's over. you ruined it. you can't work here anymore."
10754,Lynette,"yeah, i do mind. i mind deeply."
11977,Lynette,wait a minute. that was all the money you had?
8777,Lynette,"let go of me! what's the matter with you? run, boys, run!"
12965,Lynette,"yeah. i was account executive for eight years, vp for four more after that, and by the way, i wrote my graduate thesis on the rise of the nonfiction novel."
11886,Lynette,will you stop being so heroic?! i'm a cancer bi*ch! what?
8776,Lynette,"oh, i don't think so. oh!"
9167,Lynette,yeah.
10697,Lynette,she and turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
10609,Lynette,eight hours of grueling labor.
13224,Lynette,what?
10224,Lynette,tom--
8873,Lynette,that's the second time this week. they never used to fight like that when mary alice was alive.
9378,Lynette,i see topher's made a speedy recovery.
9756,Lynette,"parker, guess what i got."
9948,Lynette,"oh, no!"
11559,Lynette,you put him in the freezer and kept cashing the checks.
13111,Lynette,hours? it was two minutes. it's not like i'm lighting candles and putting on barry white.
13292,Lynette,"parker, knock it off."
12177,Lynette,"great, actually. we're great."
11902,Lynette,my kids' tree house. can you promise you'll leave it alone?
13150,Lynette,"uh, tell him i'll call right back."
12420,Lynette,don't thank me. thank your father.
12243,Lynette,"oh, sweetie, i am so sorry. i bet that really scared you, didn't it?"
10987,Lynette,"yeah, i'm gonna make you a cake."
9823,Lynette,i don't know. maybe i shouldn't be working.
9568,Lynette,you hired your old girlfriend and you didn't tell me for three months?
10952,Lynette,"no!i-- we're--we have--we're sharing custody,and then,she tried to seduce my husband, so--"
13042,Lynette,pardon?
12036,Lynette,what are you talking about?
11139,Lynette,"okay, let's go."
10886,Lynette,"well, that sort of depends on daddy."
12837,Lynette,"yeah, i do."
10112,Lynette,you're an attractive man.there is a primal need for a woman to protect what is hers.my initial impulse was justified.
11413,Lynette,clean for almost a year.
10190,Lynette,"no, that's okay.i know you're exhausted.you should go to bed."
12941,Lynette,he's doing great.
13027,Lynette,"no, you won't get the chance 'cause i'm gonna kill you first. the houselights are up, gaby. you can drop the act. you only helped me get this job because you needed a spy."
10461,Lynette,oh.
8826,Lynette,let 'em look. as long as they don't try and cut in.
13146,Lynette,tom. what are you doing here? is everything all right?
11830,Lynette,movie. it's a western.
10476,Lynette,what?
10193,Lynette,that's actually good.
13179,Lynette,what are you doing?
10916,Lynette,"okay. never mind. i'm leaving. first, i'm just gonna give your mom a hug."
10815,Lynette,that's not fair! it's not his fault!
12927,Lynette,"all right, that's enough! let go of him! let go of him! let go of him!"
13235,Lynette,what was that? i thought you said the tour was fantastic.
9348,Lynette,i'll call. bree?
10953,Lynette,"okay, i gotta keep the pressure up to stop the bleeding!"
10432,Lynette,"no,i don't hold her responsible.bree van de kamp and i have known each other a long time.i trust her completely.she's a wonderful friend and a fantastic mother.she puts the rest of us to shame."
10511,Lynette,"he's under contract.if you just fire him,he'll sue you, and i'll back him up.you need cause."
10973,Lynette,"hello. oh, this side. hi!"
12799,Lynette,"well, you've certainly had quite a glamorous life."
8829,Lynette,"well, the little girl."
9307,Lynette,"i'm sorry, but you should have consulted me."
11425,Lynette,it was so awful tonight.
9186,Lynette,"i'm just picking up my sick poor little baby boy. all right, here."
10070,Lynette,"i am not on your side, ed."
11508,Lynette,"ah, is this your way of guilting me into coming back home?"
12872,Lynette,son of a--
9266,Lynette,"i need to know if my policy covers it. no, my car actually wasn't involved. it was my neighbor's car, but the egg was mine. uh huh. can i please speak to your supervisor?"
10620,Lynette,"i must have been crazy, agreeing to this."
13200,Lynette,you're not doing this. we can't afford it!
13310,Lynette,"seriously, stop or i will hurt you."
9626,Lynette,"yeah, he's been thinking about making a move for a while. he kind of feels like he's done everything he can where he is now."
9959,Lynette,"porter, preston, what have i told you about playing outside after dark?"
10473,Lynette,"ugh!because it's dirty and wrong, and i'll wash your mouth out with soap! that's why."
10032,Lynette,i am?
9514,Lynette,yeah.
13051,Lynette,"i mean, it really is the kind of thing a relative should do. maybe it is, but we're in the car, on our way there, so stop your bitching."
10800,Lynette,"hey, hey, that is not helpful. it only takes one, parker! only takes one!"
10468,Lynette,"i talked to mrs. mccluskey,and for god's sakes,parker,you can't ask people things like that."
9604,Lynette,alright?i'm coming in.
9328,Lynette,head lice.
9779,Lynette,"hi, i'm back. how's he doing?"
8816,Lynette,oooh. who cracked anyway?
10382,Lynette,i love it. i just love it.let get a copy to ed.
13075,Lynette,she never let me forget it either. she always insisted it was the tequila shooters that killed the cancer.
11798,Lynette,"oh, my god."
11779,Lynette,"yeah, so far--not that bad. though i did have to kick tom out yesterday."
11477,Lynette,are you kidding? i should be thanking you. we took in three grand tonight.
9801,Lynette,"what? oh, um. well, since i'm here, maybe she could just relax in the house for a little while, okay?"
9110,Lynette,hi.
11982,Lynette,what? what? we're having lunch.
10766,Lynette,"see?this is what you do. you just manipulate. you wormed your way into my family. you conned your way into coming on this trip with me, and now you wanna force me into saving you. well, forget it! you wanna go, go."
13009,Lynette,hey.
10728,Lynette,"well, i thought you might need a change of clothes. yeah, you're still mad at me, huh?"
10153,Lynette,and since you're immune--
9145,Lynette,you and i have had crushes before. we always tell each other. we laugh about it. it's no big deal. what worries me about this is you're denying you're obviously attracted. why?
12546,Lynette,"and the rest of the stuff--you'll find a way to fix it. just know that all your friends are very proud of you. bitterly jealous, but proud."
9068,Lynette,what?
10870,Lynette,"well, think about it. you're gonna do all these fun parties. people will start talking-- ""hey, this is great food. this guy should open a restaurant."" ""yeah, yeah, i'd eat there,"" and then wham! five short years later, you have a built-in customer base."
12077,Lynette,karen! you gotta get inside now!
12939,Lynette,"the hard part was when my friend tried help me with a loan, and i thanked her by becoming a lunatic and denting her car."
11626,Lynette,"well, okay, then."
12622,Lynette,you're having sex with your best friend's mother?!
9280,Lynette,"i know, they've being punished. probably for life. but i needed you to see something. they said they stole it from mike's garage. from inside his work bench. your mike."
11861,Lynette,it was itchy.
10939,Lynette,"oh, that's rough. excuse me."
13204,Lynette,really? poor bruce.
10902,Lynette,"well, maybe you should try to patch things up with him."
12170,Lynette,"oh, you don't have to do that."
11252,Lynette,"wait, ed! ed, please don't go. yes, i lied, and that was wrong, but my husband needed my help."
11621,Lynette,hey.
11196,Lynette,"really? well, what if i were to very briefly refresh your memory?"
12873,Lynette,"hey, can i borrow you a sec?"
10769,Lynette,yeah.
12028,Lynette,"oh, crap! now where do you think you're going?"
11590,Lynette,thank god for italian. you can charge way more for 'orecchiette with pancetta' than you'd ever get for 'bacon and little ears.'
9100,Lynette,no.
11617,Lynette,and i have nothing to offer! i am taken! god!
9230,Lynette,i seriously doubt that.
11573,Lynette,we missed you.
10064,Lynette,there's science to back that up.
9251,Lynette,"guys, guys, guys, hey, my hands are tied. thieves get spanked. just the way it works. unless--"
9555,Lynette,good.
9996,Lynette,"guys, we talked about this. what happened to standing up for ourselves?"
9651,Lynette,"oh, well, yeah. i think it would be good for you to take some time off."
13038,Lynette,"oh, yeah. i plan to get drunk and bitch about my boss."
12386,Lynette,preston?
10056,Lynette,yeah.
10416,Lynette,"i'm sorry,mr. bormanis,but i'm not gonna testify.it just doesn't feel right to me."
12892,Lynette,"tom? come here. we haven't had a customer in about a half an hour, so maybe we should just--close up early."
9958,Lynette,you should hold onto that stuff for a while.
10576,Lynette,--playing russian roulette with my ovaries and--
11025,Lynette,he's a single man with a basement full of toys!
10467,Lynette,"no,i'm not gonna shame my son."
9997,Lynette,"no, stu! these people don't deserve muffins."
10463,Lynette,"uh,yeah. of course.no,sorry."
11364,Lynette,no.
10958,Lynette,how can you say that?
9080,Lynette,"fine, fine. be three-foot-eight the rest of your life. see if i care. good luck finding girlfriends!"
9791,Lynette,you couldn't have given them coffee or something? i just feel like i'm missing out on their lives entirely.
9139,Lynette,"okay. well, you gals, um, shop your little hearts out. see you later."
9833,Lynette,parker!
8926,Lynette,because now no one on the play committee even wants to talk to me.
13296,Lynette,"honey, i'm hating you a little right now."
9876,Lynette,yeah?
10510,Lynette,you can't make my husband your scapegoat.i won't let you.
11010,Lynette,my kids are having a hard time. they're pretty freaked out by that whole supermarket thing.
9199,Lynette,"hey, rodney!"
10527,Lynette,"oh,it'll never happen.he knows this place will go down like a house of cards without me."
10058,Lynette,i work because my family needs me to.
9337,Lynette,what'd tammy want?
10036,Lynette,"oh, god, ed. i am so sorry."
11454,Lynette,and we're offering that for twelve dollars.
10236,Lynette,"well--um, let me just call in a few references before we make anything official."
10729,Lynette,"i'm sorry, i was desperate. i had a little too much to drink and you are divorcing carlos."
9196,Lynette,"you can do this, all right? just, just scootch down a few inches, and i'll grab you."
9636,Lynette,"uh, you can, honey, if you can pay for it."
11918,Lynette,what? that doesn't even make sense.
10681,Lynette,"hey, nora, wow.we weren't expecting you until seven."
8960,Lynette,thanks.
8977,Lynette,"great, this will keep the crab dip warm. it took forever to shell the little buggers, but it'll be worth it."
10332,Lynette,"yes,i am."
10891,Lynette,"hey, you."
10315,Lynette,"look,i apologize in advance for how this is going to sound,but i have to ask. it's just gonna eat away at me.were you drinking while baby-sitting my kids?"
12883,Lynette,"no, you're the one who's never gonna let me forget it."
9860,Lynette,hey.
9070,Lynette,how can you stay here after the way she treats you?
11131,Lynette,you know what might solve something?if you were home once in a while.you're the one she listens to.
9193,Lynette,"sorry."" ""excuse me."
8864,Lynette,"go!go, go!"
10934,Lynette,i am right there with you.
12377,Lynette,what?
11665,Lynette,thank you.
10817,Lynette,i was trying to repair my son's shattered self-esteem.
12023,Lynette,"fine, the backseat, but you're just gonna spoil her."
10181,Lynette,why not?
10170,Lynette,"i don't want you to have options,tom.if i die,i wanna hear your life would be over.i want you to spend the rest of your life screaming,""it should've been me on that plane!"""
12994,Lynette,"not great. see, while i was working at scavo's, i got seven years older, which is weird, seeing as how all the c.e.o.s got seven years younger. the bottom line is, no one wants to hire someone who could have made out with their dad on prom night. anyway, i hear carlos is looking for a new director of marketing. think you could put in a good word for me?"
12383,Lynette,"we always knew he'd do something like this eventually, and he did."
13054,Lynette,"well, if she knew what you're about to do for her, she'd forgive you for everything."
9825,Lynette,"no! no, no, no, no, no! it would help if you came up with some ideas."
11451,Lynette,"oh, i don't wanna scare them away."
12146,Lynette,"well, sure. i'm easy. thanks."
9457,Lynette,what do you mean porter had less fun? i'll raise.
11776,Lynette,please let me help. i feel so guilty just sitting here.
9424,Lynette,"thanks."" ""i'll play with you."
12385,Lynette,"again? i am so sorry, officer. we have talked to porter till we're blue in the face. it's like he's determined to go back to juvenile hall."
12772,Lynette,call bob. tell him we can make the hearing tomorrow.
12572,Lynette,"just so i'm clear, you want us to sell our thriving business so we can live in a bus, like carnies?"
8844,Lynette,it seems there may be more to mary alice's death than you were aware of .
11623,Lynette,"ooh, sorry. by the way, we are gonna need to find a new chef. rick gave notice."
10508,Lynette,you're gonna fire me?
13070,Lynette,"no, i can't. uh, see? cancer."
10135,Lynette,"oh, well,i'm not surprised,and i really, really hope you can work it out."
10131,Lynette,"all righty, then,my work here is done.carlos, gaby."
11218,Lynette,your new manager? no.
9423,Lynette,great.
12980,Lynette,"i do, and it's okay. besides, did you hear what came out of my mouth? like i said--wow."
8913,Lynette,"aye, aye."
11128,Lynette,"no. first, she ripped off its arms, stuffed it with chili. then she threw it in the trash."
9586,Lynette,yes. it soaked through a little. that is the nature of baby sick. do you want me to wear a haz-mat suit or are you going to be okay?
11645,Lynette,"really? and what do you call this, ambush therapy?"
12364,Lynette,"okay, so at the risk of cracking these eggshells i've been walking on all week, any idea when you're gonna stop being so angry?"
10177,Lynette,thank you.
9873,Lynette,i can handle the extra hours.
9412,Lynette,are you saying i can't be tactful?
8744,Lynette,"i don't know, but check out the postmark."
12414,Lynette,"sorry to have barged in, and thanks for letting me get that off my chest."
9858,Lynette,"no, it's fine, i'll pick it up on my way home. so, what do you want?"
9182,Lynette,oh.
9250,Lynette,"well, we could go with the old hickory stick. it's a clich, but it's pretty effective. i know, we'll go with the spatula. the holes give it less wind resistance. moves faster."
8885,Lynette,hey.
13295,Lynette,"well, these are trained technicians and i've got a roast in the-freezer."
12424,Lynette,yeah. remember when you spent the entire day on the internet trying to find a new gearshift knob? worst anniversary ever.
8891,Lynette,so he just blew you off?
12286,Lynette,"it's okay, sweetie. you're gonna be just fine. there."
12692,Lynette,a witness? i--
12392,Lynette,"okay, you're not gonna believe this, but--she's back."
9972,Lynette,"hi, guys."
12331,Lynette,"tom, if you had been there and heard what she said--"
8961,Lynette,great! you wanna run it by me?
9366,Lynette,really?
11581,Lynette,rick? why would we want to let him go?
12803,Lynette,"all right, time for my luck to change. this hand is for eli. hmm, next hand is for eli."
10837,Lynette,"don't you dare! you are gonna chase your dream, and i am gonna support you 99 % of the time."
9973,Lynette,oh.
10472,Lynette,because it's not.
12475,Lynette,what?
9223,Lynette,hold on. i made you a drink.
11534,Lynette,"no, it would be, but sunday nights are kind of crazy. i'm packing lunches and checking homework--"
13052,Lynette,and say what?
12276,Lynette,"tom, it is one thing not to want to admit something's wrong with your kid. it's another to just bury your head in the sand."
11273,Lynette,"look, i don't know what kind of hustle you pulled on him, but it's not gonna work on me."
11906,Lynette,because you'd never win. bossy women rule this street. you know that.
12366,Lynette,"fine. you can be as angry and sulky and pissy as you want, just so long as you're here tomorrow, helping me crank out 250 mini pizzas."
9820,Lynette,thank you.
11954,Lynette,perfect. where can i get one?
9452,Lynette,"oh, um, my babysitter cancelled"
13216,Lynette,"yes. you are going to look at me someday with your brand-new face and say, ""when did she get so old?"" we won't look like we belong together anymore."
9567,Lynette,please do.
13064,Lynette,why? chemo's not until 5.
11253,Lynette,"like i said, really, really wrong, but if you take me back, i swear i will give you one hundred percent."
9428,Lynette,what?
11015,Lynette,"it's okay.you can trust him,really.art is the one who saved me at the supermarket.he's sort of a superhero."
10802,Lynette,the kid's got an arm like a 13-year-old.
9552,Lynette,"she is an old, old friend of your daddy's."
11638,Lynette,"oh, wow. well, i'd love to chat, but i have cheese to grate."
10278,Lynette,"a million teenagers in this neighborhood,and you hire mccluskey?"
13180,Lynette,"well, think inside. i made porkchops."

8975,Lynette,"i'm not going to forget about this, jordana."
11302,Lynette,no. why would i order fifty high chairs for the opening of a pizzeria?
11841,Lynette,"parents who weren't stoned. my whole childhood passed in a blur because you were medicating yourself--pot when you were sick, booze when you weren't. i am not going to do that. i won't miss a second of my kids' lives, not if i can avoid it."
13222,Lynette,"oh? well, good luck paying for it, because if you so much as apply for a passport, we're cuttin' you off."
11023,Lynette,hello?
8949,Lynette,let's take it outside.

12317,Lynette,i just--it's good for us to hang out. i enjoy it.
8734,Lynette,"oh wait, i gotta tell you, i was having trouble with swelling, so the doctor took me off the pill, so you're just gonna have to put on a condom."
12678,Lynette,i'll pick you up tonight. i'll give you a ride to the bus station. you can count it then.
10317,Lynette,really?is that why you passed out on your front lawn yesterday morning?

11577,Lynette,what?
13161,Lynette,okay. okay. we'll have sex. but can you make it quick?
9066,Lynette,hey.
12864,Lynette,"well, we've filled the place many times, but it's your party. whatever you want."
12882,Lynette,"whoa. talk about luck. when i offered to throw you this little thank-you party, i never imagined that it would turn into an opportunity for me to learn from the great bree hodge."
10617,Lynette,thank you.
9766,Lynette,"uh, about tomorrow morning--"
8970,Lynette,"hey, jordana!"
10269,Lynette,"so-- can this be a place of business again,ed?no more games?"

9034,Lynette,i'm so tired of feeling like a failure.
12155,Lynette,what are you doing here?
8964,Lynette,and when exactly would this formal dinner take place?
10570,Lynette,"okay, bye."
11076,Lynette,i'll do the chips. you deal.
10890,Lynette,"it's a grown-up word, and when daddy comes home, you'll learn a new one: grovel."
11716,Lynette,"nothing happened between me and rick. yes, he came on to me, but unlike you, i controlled myself."
11438,Lynette,could you excuse me a second? i'm sorry. i'm sorry. what's up?
11209,Lynette,"and tonight i'm gonna slap on some sex perfume and you're gonna get naked, and then we're gonna see who the man is."
9911,Lynette,and you know what else? i kicked ass in that meeting because of this suit.
11463,Lynette,yeah? rick learned how to make this in italy. go ahead. try it. i wanna see what you think.
10667,Lynette,"yeah, your damn straight i lied.i will not have that lunatic ruining one more family gathering."
9152,Lynette,"hi, i understand your agency handles nannies. uh, i need someone experienced and preferably unattractive."
10692,Lynette,"personally, i love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser you can't beat chicken."
12519,Lynette,"durber. hey! well, this was one great guy. he would schlep all the way across town just to get me my chinese food. so--what are you up to?"
11041,Lynette,sorry?
11973,Lynette,"come on. it must be driving you crazy living with five screaming kids underfoot. i don't blame you for wanting a little peace and quiet. you need to leave, mom."
8810,Lynette,"the kids are bouncing off the walls?huh. well i'm sure you can find a way to put them to bed, tom. i mean, for god's sakes, tom, they're just kids."
11802,Lynette,"oh, i'm gonna be sick."
9686,Lynette,"jeez, are you crying?"
11636,Lynette,you won the beer pong championship?
12273,Lynette,you don't understand.
13128,Lynette,what little friendship?
13264,Lynette,do you know what they are?
10698,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey! please!"
12942,Lynette,yeah. he's up early today. he just doesn't know what he's doing next.
11707,Lynette,"until your wedding, of course."
10040,Lynette,"so, he poisoned rex?"
11104,Lynette,of course you did.
8901,Lynette,and that's what i told them.
10078,Lynette,"hi, bunny, bunny. hi."
9897,Lynette,i'm willing to make sacrifices.
12094,Lynette,"yeah, right. oh, you're serious?"
12130,Lynette,okay.
10888,Lynette,"'cause he decided to take it in his pizza place.not this pizza place.it's a rat hole.but once your dad comes to his senses and stops being petulant, he'll come home."
12821,Lynette,"tom, i cannot just stay at home wiping noses. i need it for my sanity, and i need you to back me up."
12732,Lynette,"honey, that's porter."
12151,Lynette,"yeah, but how do you get the answers if you don't ask the questions?"
9353,Lynette,thank you.
13149,Lynette,"no, this is a really bad time for me. well, you did buy me that deodorant. ooh!"
11846,Lynette,"we, it's amazing what a week without chemo can do."
11633,Lynette,"there's nothing to talk about, okay? just leave me alone."
11059,Lynette,you're damn right there's a problem. i can't find my son.
13167,Lynette,i'm sorry. i was exhausted.
12878,Lynette,"oh, sure. it's only money, right?"
11412,Lynette,"you know how stressful it is working in a four-star restaurant, and he, like many chefs, started using cocaine just to stay ahead--"
10020,Lynette,black?
13215,Lynette,"tom, if you're unsatisfied with your looks, someday you're gonna be unsatisfied with mine."
12254,Lynette,"i need to ask you something, and i want you to tell me the truth, okay? did you have anything to do with the fire at rick's restaurant?"
8974,Lynette,"yeah. just three or four pills, i'm really hitting a wall here."
11743,Lynette,he's gonna be watching for me all day.he's one of the leads.
11455,Lynette,for the appetizer portion. the entre is twenty.
12932,Lynette,"hey. i got $6,200 for the oven."
9117,Lynette,she's bringing him home from the hospital today.
12541,Lynette,"so--give me some guidance. do i grovel, send flowers, or--"
11203,Lynette,"aw, come on, tom."
8752,Lynette,"i have no help, my husband's always away on business."
12545,Lynette,"it is. you're at the start of an incredible journey, and i am going to be there every step of the way, cheering you on, telling anyone who will listen that the bree van de kamp is my friend."
9287,Lynette,it was a murder.
10760,Lynette,"that is not what i'm saying. but if you did, i'd find a way to carry on."
10304,Lynette,hey!
9192,Lynette,no! you're not dying! people just think that because i shaved your head.
11044,Lynette,"well, i don't."
9979,Lynette,"tom, you're not off the hook here."
11437,Lynette,"look, i think you're great, and we would be lucky to have you. it's just, my husband isn't really comfortable--"
9389,Lynette,"um, hi. i, i wanted to introduce myself to your mom. i'm lynette scavo."
11699,Lynette,"no! tom, you didn't ask my mother?!"
8907,Lynette,"oh,thank you."
8871,Lynette,you're not having any more kids. what do you care?
10600,Lynette,why did she wait so long to contact you?
12066,Lynette,"no, that's ridiculous. karen, come on."
10971,Lynette,"i thought they were little young to deal with their mother getting shot. all i told them is kayla is staying with her grandmother, and i made up a story about how i got hurt."
12998,Lynette,enough with the shrugging. come on.
9480,Lynette,"oh, that's cute. that's great. here, give them here."
10599,Lynette,uhh!
9293,Lynette,"well, whatever works for ya."
12783,Lynette,no. no. it means she outsmarted her mom.
8738,Lynette,she was having sex with some guy when the fire started.
11585,Lynette,probably.we got a big party coming in at ten. so--mm-hmm. i'll just see you in the morning.
10946,Lynette,"put daddy on, and i'll buy you a real robot."
11712,Lynette,"well, if history's any indicator, i won't have to wait long."
12551,Lynette,what? of course not. why would you say something like that?
13232,Lynette,oh.
11135,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry,but we gotta go. i have a dinner party i have to get to."
9215,Lynette,"you know, the house isn't that big, rodney. you're going to have to stop avoiding me."
10282,Lynette,we will find someone--someone who doesn't remember what they were doing the day lincoln was shot.
12571,Lynette,"okay, let me ask you one tiny question about this big adventure plan of yours who's gonna be running our restaurant while we're off doing the electric kool-aid acid test?"
9096,Lynette,"no. she's fine. i just wanted us all to spend the day together, you know, like we used to. here we go. once upon a time there was a young turtle named harvey. every day harvey would all tell the other turtles, ""one day i'm going to fly off this island and go see the world."" the other turtles laughed and said ""turtles can't fly."" oh, it's getting good now, huh?"
9016,Lynette,i know you're not.
10293,Lynette,"oh,yes.oh,yeah,me too. thank you."
10283,Lynette,"so,here's the deal.um,there was a little miscommunication,and as it turns out,we don't need ya."
9076,Lynette,"if i don't get some help, i will lose my mind.where can i score some high-grade nanny?"
10900,Lynette,"oh, god, here she goes again. what grade is he in?"
9098,Lynette,"does she, now? okay. harvey didn't like the turtles laughing, so he told them,"" "" i'll show you. one day i will fly higher than the birds!"
13087,Lynette,then we dump her.
13254,Lynette,"hey, babe. how'd the test go?"
12525,Lynette,oh.
8708,Lynette,oh.
12722,Lynette,what took you so long?
11684,Lynette,"anyway, i know i said that we would come and visit you this june, but i'll be a little woozy and--bald from the chemo, so--thanks for understanding. oh, one more thing--our insurance policy has a really high deductible, so we are strapped financially, and i was wondering if maybe you and dave might be able to--oh, really? no, i am not asking mom. she doesn't know about any of this, so don't you tell her, okay? we'll be fine. i love you. bye."
9895,Lynette,"yeah, well, this one was the most expensive. the other ones aren't as nice. but look. look, look, look, look at me, look at me. watch. i don't walk in it. i glide."
10500,Lynette,"mnh-mnh-mnh.""yeah? what did you want to do to me?"""
12206,Lynette,the obnoxious backstabber just called your name.
9721,Lynette,"you know, for the sake of our marriage, please don't mention the system again."
11946,Lynette,"sweetie, let me ask you something. if you had to choose between mommy's beautiful garden and a gross, mean, dirty possum, what would you pick?"
10536,Lynette,what? that can't be right.
10215,Lynette,"oh, hey! hey!"
9227,Lynette,you knew about this?
9422,Lynette,"yeah, well it's not working too well if you have to unload on a perfect stranger, is it? if you're unhappy in your marriage, do something, instead of just complaining, 'cause frankly, i don't want to hear it!"
9914,Lynette,"sometimes we just need to get something that makes us happy. i know that sounds selfish, but i've been thinking. it might make us better people and maybe even better parents."
13053,Lynette,mm. why don't you start with the time she tried to steal your comatose boyfriend? that was fun.
12205,Lynette,"yeah, we were sure one of you would end up killing the other."
12896,Lynette,"it's not a slump. in this economy, people aren't eating out as much. between that and porter's legal bills and paying bree back, we are about a week away from going bankrupt."
9008,Lynette,"you know, you're right."
11648,Lynette,"yeah, a little."
9357,Lynette,"she's devastated about the breakup, and she hasn't left the house in days."
8969,Lynette,"yeah, it's good for your career. i'll pull it off."
9643,Lynette,"okay. okay. could we go home and talk about this, please?"
13130,Lynette,cause it's patty rizzo. she's a total slut. you should be on antibiotics just for sitting in her car.
13267,Lynette,"so it is the cancer. oh, god, i can't go through this again!"
9720,Lynette,"yeah, i sorta did."
12263,Lynette,"you didn't see her. she just sat there, playing with her doll with this kind of eerie calm."
9493,Lynette,i don't know what to say. it's stunning. thank you.
12859,Lynette,hi.
9524,Lynette,"it uh, must have slipped his mind."
9627,Lynette,"he's more then solid, tom's ideas are spectacular. he's passionate about his work. his visual instincts are off the chart."
8821,Lynette,you're wearing a really big hat.
9486,Lynette,i'll get the door.
11874,Lynette,oh.
10634,Lynette,what if you pull out his key chain?
11818,Lynette,"yeah, about that-- i don't think i'm gonna make it."
9565,Lynette,"well, that's just something that wives say to their husbands."
12139,Lynette,right.
12724,Lynette,"hey, preston."
10018,Lynette,"come on, nina, we both know why you got rid of him."
11914,Lynette,"yes, but that was before your best friend threw her scarf in the ring."
12520,Lynette,your company? you have a company?
11241,Lynette,his grandfather left him all that money.
11208,Lynette,"so tomorrow, first thing, we'll fix the plumbing, we'll call an exterminator, we'll rent some chairs and we will open on time, and it'll be a glorious success that you will have achieved with my help, okay?"
8925,Lynette,she's a total nightmare. i guess i shouldn't have challenged her.
10009,Lynette,"no more belittling, berating, rude sarcasm."
8900,Lynette,fifteen thousand.
9275,Lynette,the boys have something they'd like to say to you.
10723,Lynette,"hey, carlos. you should come over to our table. that's where all the hotties are."
9089,Lynette,yeah. i don't really think i could videotape claire. it would be a breach of trust.
12032,Lynette,handle what?
9984,Lynette,"just wait for it. okay, here he comes."
12068,Lynette,you okay?
10445,Lynette,"oh,my goodness."
11561,Lynette,okay.
12224,Lynette,"andrew, do something! do something! stop it! stop! oh, for god sakes, what is the matter with you? what are you, 12 years old? stop it. jeez."
10905,Lynette,"mm-hmm. yeah, you are!"
12632,Lynette,"i know everything, okay?"
12010,Lynette,okay. okay. i guess you're right.
10909,Lynette,"oh, stop right there. i am the one who should apologize. i have been a bad wife."
9203,Lynette,don't take it personally. he's scared to climb down.
11719,Lynette,how can you say that?
12073,Lynette,what are you talking about? i had you over for lemonade last week.
9377,Lynette,"hey, tammy."
12007,Lynette,she's broke and old and rude. that is not a winning combination on the street.
11975,Lynette,i just think it would work better for everyone if you got your own place.
9344,Lynette,"yeah, not so cool now, huh?"
9272,Lynette,"fine, i'll do it."
10098,Lynette,the teenager?
12237,Lynette,"okay, you are angry, so i'm gonna let that one pass, and i'm gonna say this for e very last time. nothing happened between me and rick."
10375,Lynette,"fair enough, fair enough.okay, what is your secret?how can you eat like that and keep your figure?"
9326,Lynette,i'll be right back.
9211,Lynette,"uh, it's nice to meet you."
10314,Lynette,"well,i mean,i just don't understand how porter and preston managed to wrangle her into the stroller and then make it out your front door without you even noticing.i guess if you'd fallen asleep--it could've happened like that,i-i guess."
9875,Lynette,yeah.
9006,Lynette,an innocent woman gets hit by a car and the driver just takes off? i don't think it's extreme.
10627,Lynette,"are we just gonna keep talking louder?is that the plan?you wanna just keep raising your voice 'cause that's how you get what you want, right?you make a scene, you throw a tantrum, and everyone gets scared and backs off.well, i don't work that way, lady.i don't care that my husband was so phenomenally stupid and or drunk to actually have sex with you.i'm not gonna let it ruin my life. am i talking loud enough for that to get through to you?"
11831,Lynette,sorry.
10483,Lynette,"guys,i'm all for bashing exes,but let's save a little of our hate for his partner in crime--the other woman."
10438,Lynette,welcome to parenthood.come on.
9358,Lynette,because it's personal. it's the kind of thing she would only want me to tell her friends.
12789,Lynette,"no, i didn't. from the moment glen died, you were out of control. it's true you lost all that money in vegas. you started drinking again. and how many times did i go to your condo, only to find you asleep on the sofa with a cigarette in your mouth? no, i won't apologize for bringing you here. i did it because i love you."
11849,Lynette,"okay, so here are your options. ""a,"" we could go romantic, play soft music, light some candles, or ""b,"" go straight to the--"
12669,Lynette,"yes, that time, the building was empty."
13305,Lynette,i'm on my way.
11865,Lynette,tom? the kids are asleep. are you coming to bed anytime soon?
10376,Lynette,i didn't know you had a child.
12410,Lynette,"hey, susan?"
13083,Lynette,"okay, we're here. guys--wake up. guys? we're home. get out."
10573,Lynette,"yeah. hang on.i'll call you later. okay, bye."
11021,Lynette,"parker, come on, we're gonna get out of here."
9610,Lynette,hey.
9240,Lynette,i love you!
11938,Lynette,in the garden there. has something been digging in there?
12117,Lynette,"oh, my goodness."
10912,Lynette,ding-dong.
12592,Lynette,um--neat or rocks?
12255,Lynette,"i'm looking for a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer here."
11869,Lynette,hi.
13105,Lynette,tom!
12063,Lynette,yeah. he'd be very safe. we could put him in a closet.
8807,Lynette,"preston, would you come here?"
10625,Lynette,we can't afford this.we have four kids.tom just lost his job.that'd bankrupt us.
11201,Lynette,good for him.
9497,Lynette,"um, mrs mcclusky, thank you, that is very nice."
10495,Lynette,"okay, that's good.then what?"
12516,Lynette,"i'm telling you, the only thing staler than that ad campaign is this dinner roll."
12016,Lynette,"oh, just a little cancer. no, but i kicked its ass. i'm good now. you come here. oh! so why--why are you here?"
13084,Lynette,you bet.
11768,Lynette,"hey, i told you i'm collecting queens."
9969,Lynette,really?
12972,Lynette,yeah.
9335,Lynette,"aw, jeez. it looks like a sesame seed."
12230,Lynette,"that's true. i saw him. i was mad that he ditched me, so i went to drag his ass back inside. but when i saw him shouting at the radio, i decided i'll just wait and make his life miserable when we get home. so unless there's a law against choosing lebron james over your wife, i think we're done here."
9002,Lynette,"so, has anyone been over there?"
9592,Lynette,"no, i'm glad that you find my humiliation so entertaining."
10024,Lynette,word got out that you and nina were-
11355,Lynette,"good point, good point. but right now we're talking about these ugly-ass uniforms."
9354,Lynette,"um, i'm not sure."
8894,Lynette,umgophers.
9292,Lynette,i'm not saying to beg. you just have to step up from time to time. you have to see your opportunity and take it. nobody respects a shrinking violet.
9074,Lynette,how fast can you pack?
9077,Lynette,she's a total nightmare.
10908,Lynette,"oh, just a quiet night with the girls."
12879,Lynette,"we all know how well you're doing, bree. you have made that very clear. but you shouldn't be lording it over everybody just 'cause you've caught a couple of breaks."
9704,Lynette,seriously?
9806,Lynette,i'm looking for parker's umbrella. have you seen it?
12813,Lynette,the doctor just called. i'm pregnant.
10940,Lynette,"hey, nora. how's tricks? i thought it was your car i saw in the lot."

10201,Lynette,they're calling me in for a meeting.i gotta go. love you. bye!
12321,Lynette,"well, we've done enough damage for one day. let's go home."
9262,Lynette,get out of my house!
9617,Lynette,she said she might be a little late. they already started moving a few of mike's things over to her house.
10700,Lynette,"more importantly, ever since he entered the picture, squeaky fromm is never around. it has been bliss! i haven't made this face. in a week. if you ruin this, so help me, i will hurt you!"
9799,Lynette,"come on, come on, come on, come on, come on."
8790,Lynette,"yeah, it'll be fun. bree's cooking, everyone's coming."

11285,Lynette,"yes, sir. okay, that's enough."
11981,Lynette,have fun.
11550,Lynette,don't turn around. m.
8994,Lynette,"and when you work on a pitch, or you bring the partners over, i am reminded of a world i left behind where i was the winner, and people tried to keep up with me! i can't go back. i can't win where i am. i'm stuck in the middle, and it is really starting to get to me."
10784,Lynette,"hey, parker, where's your uniform? you got your game in an hour."
10823,Lynette,"no.it was excitement, because we have just decided you don't have to play baseball anymore. ha! isn't that great?"
12245,Lynette,"oh, my god."
9445,Lynette,"yeah, a lot of good it did her."
12296,Lynette,she never does this.
12624,Lynette,"her name is mrs. schilling. she was your t-ball coach when you were 6. by the way, does your best friend know you're sleeping with his mother?"
9298,Lynette,"hi. so, what's the word on tim?"
10567,Lynette,"well, just, you know, say hello.it's been a long time."
13023,Lynette,"yea, i do."
12775,Lynette,where is he?
12700,Lynette,did anyone see you do this?
12418,Lynette,"come on, tom. i mean, we trust them, right?"
8985,Lynette,"i've got it covered, no problem."
12716,Lynette,"i guess i have no other choice. but again, this is all in the strictest confidence. remember, you are my lawyer, not tom's."
11555,Lynette,gaby!
12152,Lynette,i'm sorry. did i embarrass you on sunday?
8948,Lynette,"maisy, we have kids the same age, which means there are years ahead of us, having to deal with each other. so instead of playing all these petty games, why don't we put an end to this right now."
9614,Lynette,huh. speak of the devil. and i mean that.
10029,Lynette,"well, i'm not gonna lie to you. there is a possibility she'd get a slap on the wrist. so, you'll think about talking to ed?"
9114,Lynette,you sly dog.
11593,Lynette,"oh, crap."
11676,Lynette,"not yet, sweetheart. you go back to sleep now."
12344,Lynette,maynard?
12795,Lynette,i have no idea.
11051,Lynette,watch her. i'll be back. i'll be right back.
11629,Lynette,no. why would you think that?
11855,Lynette,it's 9:30.
12648,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god!"
13056,Lynette,"or what, i'll turn to stone? she's all rough and gritty."
11249,Lynette,it's cornmeal.that's the secret.
9256,Lynette,hey.
10345,Lynette,"so,boys,how do you enjoy the meat loaf?"
12081,Lynette,"oh, my god."
8725,Lynette,it's the best job i've ever had.
11988,Lynette,"oh, yeah. where is that waiter? i'm gonna go find him."
8726,Lynette,now what.
12786,Lynette,you're gonna have to.
12737,Lynette,"but if the judge finds out that porter's gone, we have to forfeit the bail."
11331,Lynette,"i told you what i want. hot bath, bed early, but you chose not to listen."
9926,Lynette,"well, you should be polite and watch it too. you know they're your guests."
12118,Lynette,"oh, yeah. okay."
13174,Lynette,tell me.
12223,Lynette,yeah.
8953,Lynette,how do you cram it all in?
10753,Lynette,"ah, i don't have a problem.i just don't think we both need to go up there.i can grab kayla and bring her back."
8967,Lynette,what did you say?
11271,Lynette,what are you doing here? i fired you.
11465,Lynette,us? what is us?
10767,Lynette,what happened to your ride?
10460,Lynette,"hey,mrs. mccluskey.so how did everything go?"
11337,Lynette,"i appreciate what you were trying to do. it was a lovely thought that just went hideously, hideously, hideously wrong."
9722,Lynette,what in the world?
10456,Lynette,"parker,i'm your mother.mothers don't lie to their sons.now go wash your hands or santa's not gonna bring you anything for christmas."
13265,Lynette,come on. i know you know. it's cancer again. am i right?
10334,Lynette,"oh. well,you don't have to bribe me.we're all friends here."
10380,Lynette,"yeah?well, that's fantastic!"
9411,Lynette,excuse me!
10556,Lynette,i knew that. you didn't have to tell me that.why did you buy flowers for milt's wife?
12345,Lynette,how did he die? was he beaten to death 'cause his name was maynard?
8936,Lynette,"bree, i totally understand. yeah, i already tried susan. and gabby can't sew to save her life but seriously, i'm going to be fine. but thanks anyway. bye!"
13162,Lynette,"morning. oh, sorry. i don't have time for breakfast."
9324,Lynette,"look, you're gonna make vice president one of these days."
9415,Lynette,"are, are we supposed to be following them?"
10577,Lynette,hi.
12210,Lynette,"okay, i-i'm gonna--i'll call you back in about five. bye."
9751,Lynette,the sandwiches from yesterday?
10983,Lynette,yeah.
12200,Lynette,"and you made me lie to them, too, which brings up another question. did you know that perjury is, like, this whole big thing?"
11656,Lynette,hmm?
9413,Lynette,are you saying i'm not tactful?
10583,Lynette,"i'm sorry that you saw my panic attack.i won't let it happen again, especially since this is my last pregnancy."
10619,Lynette,"okay, then."
10477,Lynette,that would explain all our working hours.
11298,Lynette,did you finish folding the takeout menus?
11529,Lynette,"wow, that many?"
9758,Lynette,"yeah, and the best part of it is i got you a really cool backpack."
12490,Lynette,"well, sorry. but maybe you could go skateboarding with orson."
10933,Lynette,you bet i would. kayla will be much better off without crazy in her life.
8791,Lynette,"oh. tom. there'll be liquor. and hors d'oeuvres. and grown-ups without children. and, and silverware. remember silverware?"
12067,Lynette,knock yourself out.
8959,Lynette,so somebody found out mary alice's secret--
11217,Lynette,yep. your father's taught you well.
12285,Lynette,okay. all right.
9994,Lynette,you're being rude and it's totally out of line. you know how hard we all worked on this.
12581,Lynette,right. so--what the hell?
10235,Lynette,"no, no, no, no,we never hire in the room."
9122,Lynette,hon?
12735,Lynette,what do you mean?
10857,Lynette,"hey, parker, be careful up there.i just keep thinking he's gonna come to his senses and realize it's a bad idea."
9705,Lynette,"well, all right!"
10571,Lynette,hello?
12586,Lynette,hi. what's that for?
11771,Lynette,out.
12171,Lynette,"well, maybe a little."
13026,Lynette,"well, it's probably nothing. but when carlos works on his computer at home, does he take his shirt off there, too?"
10189,Lynette,thank you.
12729,Lynette,"okay, look--you know how you're always saying i know what to do in a crisis?"
13300,Lynette,hi.
12053,Lynette,"mrs. mccluskey, please?"
9790,Lynette,dad's gonna take you.
9289,Lynette,"oh, tom, i'm so sorry."
8954,Lynette,i thought the character of madame bovary was -- very inspirational.
11524,Lynette,"i stay late because there's a lot of work to do, and right now i'm the only person who can do it, and now i have to go to the grocery store because i am the only person who can do that, mm-hmm. so why don't you go upstairs and finish your homework?"
11170,Lynette,oh.
12794,Lynette,"at least twice a week, and sometimes i'd bring the kids."
11999,Lynette,"okay, but the point is, she went."
12406,Lynette,"no, i mean you think they're cool in that you wanna be them."
10840,Lynette,"i don't know how these rumors get started. no, parker only quit the team 'cause he hurt his ankle."
10087,Lynette,that's all i'm saying.
9200,Lynette,yep.
12093,Lynette,what's all this baseball stuff? there's a mitt and a jersey. was this her husband's?
11958,Lynette,shh! do you hear that? he's making his move.
10879,Lynette,"well, i just don't. tom, you know how i feel about this pizza thing."
9320,Lynette,long.
12573,Lynette,"and when we start stealing to support ourselves, the kids can see the inside of a prison. you're right, tom. it's a brilliant idea."
9260,Lynette,"look, my boys do not break into people's houses. sure, they may have stolen your flower pot, but you know they apologized for that."
12232,Lynette,didn't i? 'cause it kinda seemed like they had you against the ropes in there.
10978,Lynette,i've gotta--
12426,Lynette,"i know you love them, but sometimes you find them so cool and entertaining, you forget to parent them."
12485,Lynette,"oh, tom! she's up in her room."
12299,Lynette,hmm?
11761,Lynette,"no. no,of course not.you know what? let's make a pact.no more secrets.from now on,we tell each other every shocking detail of our lives."
10970,Lynette,"yeah, um, listen, about that--the kids don't know what happened."
12838,Lynette,"no. i'm gonna go help my daughter with her homework. hey, penny! wait up!"
10422,Lynette,i can't believe you are old enough to drive.i still remember when you were 10 years old.i paid you a dollar to rake our leaves.
12788,Lynette,"hey, mom. i just came by to tell you that the judge threw out porter's case for lack of evidence. isn't that great? mom--i did not put you in here to punish you. i didn't have a choice."
9528,Lynette,were you ever going to tell me?
9761,Lynette,"yeah, well, honey, i have to work. mommy's boss is a mean, mean lady and if i miss work, i'll lose my job and then we won't have any money to buy food. honey, you gotta believe me, if i could be there, you know that i would."
11612,Lynette,"what? i'm so sorry. oh, my god. i'm so sorry. that paranoid idiot. you know, i knew it. i knew when we were watching the surveillance tapes that he would completely misinterpret it."
13050,Lynette,don't forget your little animals!
13199,Lynette,"you don't need a face-lift. what if i went out and got a boob job and came home with big, giant sideshow boobs? how would you like that?"
10228,Lynette,"yeah, gosh, it is.it's quite impressive.oh, wow,i see you worked for bellfore and barrasso.that's a great shop."
11843,Lynette,okay. well--i think i'll turn in.
11008,Lynette,"hey, art."
11189,Lynette,"no, thanks. two's my limit."
10057,Lynette,excuse me?
8910,Lynette,"you tossed out that little sacrifice comment a while ago and it occurred to me,i've made sacrifices over the past six years. i gave up my career! if another sacrifice has to be made, i think it's your turn on the merry-go-round."
11819,Lynette,12. and that's my point. i'm undefeated. why spoil my winning streak by playing when i'm not up to it?
9653,Lynette,"tom, that's--crazy."
11620,Lynette,"don't touch me! you have to go now. please, go. you have to go now. go on. go."
11172,Lynette,shouldn't you be working?
8932,Lynette,"well, that's what's so great about being in a democracy. everyone is entitled to their opinion. also, everyone has a right to vote. so all in favor of the woodsman going medieval on the big bad wolf's ass--"
10758,Lynette,"ah! oh, my god! knock it off! what is the matter with you?! what is wrong with you? what the hell do you think you're doing?"
12272,Lynette,"what? no. sweetie, we don't need to do that."
12936,Lynette,and that is so great. so when do you think that great thing might happen?
9333,Lynette,"aah, aah, aah."
12401,Lynette,tom? can i talk to you a sec?
9874,Lynette,yeah.
8781,Lynette,just give me a second-5 minutes.
11598,Lynette,a little. thanks for not letting me freeze last night.
9906,Lynette,"well, actually, this was already in my closet. i just forgot about it."
8845,Lynette,"hey paul, what's up?"
10799,Lynette,"hey, people, he's just a kid, okay?"
10677,Lynette,"hey, gaby, it's lynette.got a little emergency.is it okay if we use your backyard? great, great, and we take full responsibility for whatever the pony does.hope you get this message soon.oh!"
12844,Lynette,"oh, that man is walter brotski, and he just bought it."
11570,Lynette,"hey, mrs. mccluskey."
9848,Lynette,"don't be ridiculous. could we get a trough of these, please?"
8888,Lynette,i can still see your heads. the pool's not deep enough.
11760,Lynette,"i just liked being able to throw on my wig and join you guys for a cup of coffee and a good gossip about the new neighbors.you know,for five minutes,i could pretend i wasn't a sick person.but once your friends know you're sick,you can't pretend anymore 'cause you can see it in their eyes--the fear,the pity."
12496,Lynette,hey. congratulations!
10605,Lynette,"yeah, we're going home."
12705,Lynette,"tom, your rock is trying to get fingerprints off a weapon. you mind? thanks."
11921,Lynette,"looks fine to me. it's hardly ripped at all. in fact, if you give me your support--"
9815,Lynette,yes. we've met.
9794,Lynette,when did this start?
11678,Lynette,"if you're that freaked out, just get married without the bracelet."
11826,Lynette,ya ha i'm sorry. i didn't mean to--okay.
11940,Lynette,"well, we gotta do something about this."
11710,Lynette,i'm fine. everything's just fine.
12432,Lynette,"your friend gets busted for dealing drugs at school, and all you have to say is, ""i guess""?"
9067,Lynette,--i took--
11078,Lynette,hey! how you doing?
9150,Lynette,parker's getting sniffily.
12531,Lynette,"guys, i am just gonna offer her a little advice. geesh."
10028,Lynette,"oh, he'll care. he doesn't want you suing him for millions of dollars."
9877,Lynette,"well, you guys have fun. this is the fifth night in a row i haven't been home to tuck in my kids, so i'm gonna go."
9082,Lynette,"i--don't want to--shock them, by suddenly disappearing. you know? deep down, they're very sensitive."
9317,Lynette,"well, it's great, obviously. thank you."
13281,Lynette,oh!
12194,Lynette,vandalism? porter! preston! get over here!
10117,Lynette,"thank you.thank you for reminding me that i am the only woman in the whole world who could love an ""idiot"" like you.i'll talk to gaby."
8742,Lynette,let's get this show on the road.
10701,Lynette,"no, i'm good. could be a monkey."
12076,Lynette,karen!
9019,Lynette,go to hell. go to hell. go to hell. go to hell. go to hell.
12508,Lynette,i see women really responding to that.
12329,Lynette,so--no kayla?
10289,Lynette,hi. excuse me.hi.you called and you said my kids are here?
10204,Lynette,"oh, the pickings are slim.so far none of my top choices are available.hey, um, do you have someone from your old company that you could, you know,maybe recommend?"
12024,Lynette,yeah. it's the one good thing you get from a crappy childhood.
10653,Lynette,"how about, you're in the frame, bitch, move."
12688,Lynette,the first person who steps foot out that door will lose a leg.
10928,Lynette,"whoa! whoa, whoa! you have stepped onto my property, and you've talked to tom. that's two rules you've broken, and i'm not sure that top doesn't make three."
8999,Lynette,"i'm fine, really--what's going on outside?"
13260,Lynette,really? you passed the test?
12535,Lynette,"zip it, stewie."
12402,Lynette,don't you think you were kind of sending the wrong message in there?
11281,Lynette,i consult you.
11545,Lynette,gaby's coming.
12920,Lynette,what's going on?
12369,Lynette,you sure you haven't been married before?
9450,Lynette,"because i'm having drinks with friends i used to work with and they never call and if i blow them off that's it. i'm dead to them. no, i can't call patty binks, because she steals things. dammit, christy, you're thirteen years old, you've got a lot of trips to the mall ahead of you. ok, ok, i'm sorry. i'm sorry i raised my voice, i'm calm. i'm starting to think this is about money so what is it that'll make it worth your while? a hundred? that's extortion, there's no way in hell that i'm gonna. hello, hello?"
13201,Lynette,i'm not getting a boob job.
11789,Lynette,"gaby, where have you been? you went to the bathroom, like, half an hour ago."
10417,Lynette,you're saying bree did this?
9154,Lynette,i'm here for the 10 a.m. yoga meditation class.
11332,Lynette,thank you.
12979,Lynette,so dinner--wow.
11306,Lynette,now this place opens in five hours. how long will it take to fix this?
9548,Lynette,"tom, we're having a dinner party. i'm thinking of inviting annabel."
9487,Lynette,"you're going to the hospital, mrs mcclusky. you're going to be fine."
9641,Lynette,you did not.
9789,Lynette,yeah.
10074,Lynette,"you're welcome. you need to find a better way to communicate with your wife. and, fran, i know what the pressure of trying to be a super parent does to your head. you can take a break and be a great mom. doesn't this little sweetheart deserve a well-rested mommy?"
12075,Lynette,"hey, hold it! hold it! you can't go out there!"
12336,Lynette,abuse? that's ridiculous.
10081,Lynette,"yeah.i know this sounds silly,but--it kind of bugged me."
11848,Lynette,"well, it's back. and since when do you question the mojo?"
12353,Lynette,and go where? i can't get within 500 feet of my children. are you not up to speed on the people vs. lynette scavo?
9041,Lynette,i think we need to hire a nanny. full time.
9587,Lynette,"you make me feel like i just got off the shrimp boat, for god's sake."
11934,Lynette,thanks. why?
10873,Lynette,i'm trying to.i am trying to. but are you aware that 90% of restaurants tank in their first year?
13195,Lynette,"no, you're not having plastic surgery."
12264,Lynette,"no, you're missing my point."
12472,Lynette,"i do, but i'm hoping i'm wrong."
9908,Lynette,okay.
11484,Lynette,"what? yeah, sometimes. why?"
9517,Lynette,"let me tell you something: half of life is obligations. you don't want to go to your husband's company christmas party, but you do. you don't want to sell candy so your kids' band can play piccolos, but you do. you attend your third cousin's wedding. you pick up the dry cleaning. that's life. its obligation. and you are now my obligation. so tomorrow morning i'll pick you up and take you to the pharmacy."
12989,Lynette,"she's your boss? let her kiss you again, then sue her."
9224,Lynette,"yesterday, i came home, and i walked in on your dad with a woman. he's having an affair. i am so, so sorry. i know. are you okay?"
10588,Lynette,what's this now?
9890,Lynette,what's wrong with the blue suit?
13234,Lynette,"good. good. i knew if you saw the campus, you'd have a change of heart."
11132,Lynette,"i know, i know. i know."
10120,Lynette,shut up and go to sleep.
10449,Lynette,"sweetie?um,could you put the crayons down for a second?we need to talk.so i spoke to your teacher today,and she told me about the--cookie deal you made with cindy lou."
10469,Lynette,because--it's rude.
10898,Lynette,i'll take a wild guess. the man never opened a pizza place.
11232,Lynette,yeah! don't be silly. i'm fine. come on. let's go sell some toothpaste.
10560,Lynette,"do i? i'm happy.i mean, i was. why don't i just look the other way and pretend nothing's wrong?lots of women can do that."
9032,Lynette,"well, we shouldn't. we should tell each other this stuff."
8751,Lynette,you saying i'm a bad mother?
13198,Lynette,"okay, that's a lousy impression of me."
10899,Lynette,bite on this.
10541,Lynette,i don't know.anything you wanna talk about?'cause there's nothing you couldn't tell me.i would understand.
10392,Lynette,"hey,veronica.hi,donovan!my,he's getting big.how old is he?"
10128,Lynette,it kinda does.i wanna get it clear for our friendship.
13060,Lynette,thanks. i'll watch it during chemo if i'm not too tired.
9407,Lynette,i can't believe you said we'd play tennis with them.
13122,Lynette,this dinner is delicious. you really didn't have to do this.
12474,Lynette,"""gigs""? did you just say ""gigs""?"
9306,Lynette,"more travel? tom, you're barely here half the time as it is. now you're going to have -- what, twice the work load?"
11952,Lynette,that was the old lynette. the new lynette kills the possums and let's god sort 'em out.
10522,Lynette,"you're under contract.ed can't fire you unless he has just cause.so until this blows over,you have to be a model employee.show up on time,no more 3-martini lunches,and above all,have ready all your presentations."
13207,Lynette,yeah. it turns out he got the same procedure that you're thinking about getting. so i thought maybe you could chat him up about it.
8694,Lynette,"hey, it's lynette. i know you're down about this mike thing, but you got to come to poker. it'll be worth it. i got dirt on maisy gibbons."
10929,Lynette,you're the lunatic if you think i'm letting you anywhere near my husband.just drop kayla off and go.
11311,Lynette,"okay, little mix-up with the new chairs."
12861,Lynette,tom and i are so grateful for your investment that we want to do something special for you.
9929,Lynette,"oh my god! oh my god, where's the off button?"
10821,Lynette,that is not true!
10404,Lynette,"oh,sweetie--i know that we wanna keep them young as long as we can,but kids grow up.they just do."
11207,Lynette,"i don't have to. you're always giving it to me, inspiring me. remember the mouthwash jingle? you came up with the hook. and--and what about the bartlett campaign? would i have ever come up with tango-dancing fleas? all you. there's nothing that i have accomplished that i could have done without your help."
9009,Lynette,"boys, i can hear you out there. now be quiet. just sit there and color."
11380,Lynette,we run a restaurant.
10407,Lynette,"oh,i don't wanna be mad anymore.and i'm so happy to hear all that,and i am so proud of you."
9826,Lynette,hugs?
10604,Lynette,hey.
9373,Lynette,"here's the thing. acting like parents won't assign blame is like pretending they don't keep score at pee-wee league games. it's human nature. if you don't give the moms someone to blame, they'll pick a scapegoat. i can't let my boys be the scapegoat."
10827,Lynette,please? you can't bend the rules just once?
9286,Lynette,"honestly, i don't think mike did it either, but if we don't call, we're guilty of withholding evidence."
9425,Lynette,"hey, alisa, hey lily, how are you guys?"
9667,Lynette,"oh, my cell phone."
10393,Lynette,"oh,wow,he's such a big boy."
9608,Lynette,"no, i'm not turning off the lights."
13003,Lynette,"well, if i was dumb enough to answer that, i never would've gotten into northwestern."
12711,Lynette,"you're my lawyer, so anything i tell you is in confidence, right?"
10960,Lynette,"no, i will not shut up! what's the matter with you?!"
11047,Lynette,i thought you were gonna mow the lawn.
9064,Lynette,you should never take this dress off for your entire life!
13074,Lynette,now--where's that one-armed friend of yours? i'm--wanna shoot some stick.
11388,Lynette,i'm the one that told you that.
10612,Lynette,our daughter is officially named.you may go now.
10688,Lynette,"no, no, no, no.you want in you're going to have to go through me."
9355,Lynette,huh?
12826,Lynette,"i swear, if you touch this phone, i will have this baby right here and then beat you with it!"
8820,Lynette,are we happy?
12501,Lynette,"oh, god, no. her agency really whiffed-- hmm? so i'm coming up with a whole new campaign. i was looking through my old portfolio for inspiration."
9492,Lynette,"oh, mrs mcclusky, you don't have to."
12556,Lynette,uh-huh.
11968,Lynette,"oh, i was just telling everybody the good news about my--cancer."
11030,Lynette,the door was open--i was bringing him a cake.
11270,Lynette,austin?
11882,Lynette,well-- i know that.
11740,Lynette,i can handle it.
10990,Lynette,"hey, there they are!"
13025,Lynette,what? no. i'm sure she's just affectionate.
11930,Lynette,you're right. i shouldn't have done that. but that tree house is the one place my kids can go and not hear about body scans and white blood cell counts. it is their getaway from this horrible thing that i've brought into the house.
10338,Lynette,is it that bad?
11820,Lynette,"tom, hair loss and constant nausea-- those are inconveniences. losing at charades to susan meyer--that is just flat-out intolerable."
9562,Lynette,"well, what am i supposed to do? you hire your old girlfriend and you don't tell me for three months?"
12653,Lynette,"no. so if you see him, please tell me."
10748,Lynette,"allllll right. yeah.i will be there as soon as i can.god, i hate my life."
9081,Lynette,"i'm going to cancel it. the boys are in rare form, and you're still finding your way."
11342,Lynette,"well, after this year, i would be happy with any date that included food and shelter."
11542,Lynette,looks like we're working the same corner.
12168,Lynette,hi there.
10555,Lynette,"no! okay, a little bit.i'm sorry, i'm sorry.ed found receipts for flowers and theater tickets.i mean, by the way, did you--"
12097,Lynette,how did i not know this?
12957,Lynette,hi.
12400,Lynette,sorry.
12156,Lynette,weren't you the one who said i should explore other churches?
10664,Lynette,of course.
10962,Lynette,"well, maybe you deserved to be cheated on!i'm.. i'm-- i'm sorry.i shouldn't have said that."
11102,Lynette,i will love her like she is my own.
13109,Lynette,"no, i went into carlos' bathroom, closed the door, then stripped naked and took a shower."
12399,Lynette,i really appreciate it.
12412,Lynette,"well, anyway, tom refuses to acknowledge that the twins are turning into juvenile delinquents. just the other day, i was"
9184,Lynette,okay.
9210,Lynette,oh.
8750,Lynette,"i yelled at them. they never listen to me, it's very frustrating."
10989,Lynette,he said take as much time as i want with pay.
11495,Lynette,"i'm not, but susan's written a poem."
13306,Lynette,for someone with your coloring.
10811,Lynette,"absolutely. if he's cheating, he could bring home a disease."
11033,Lynette,i'm not snapping at you.
10126,Lynette,bye!mwah!
11530,Lynette,"well, yeah, i guess i could work somethin' out."
12246,Lynette,how are they doing?
11472,Lynette,"well, parker really wanted to come visit you. i'm gonna put a little water in these."
9054,Lynette,couldn't you have just said no?
10818,Lynette,yeah.
8962,Lynette,okay.
10731,Lynette,"i'm so unhappy. ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives i can't even work up a smile. and the more she pushes the more i resent tom. tom. for something he did twelve years ago. and i'm afraid if i can't fix this, that the anger is just going to fester until.."
9891,Lynette,"all right, so if i get my blue suit dry cleaned, will that be acceptable to everyone?"
11502,Lynette,"it's just-- it's something yucky, honey. go on and play with your ball. go on."
9621,Lynette,"yeah, that didn't walk into mike's garage by itself."
9115,Lynette,"bye, guys!"
9599,Lynette,you should go. you don't want to keep annabel waiting.
8917,Lynette,"i'm sorry, aren't we doing little red riding hood?"
10707,Lynette,"okay, but he didn't, he didn't, and you know until--"
13043,Lynette,i'm--not sure what you're talking about.
10887,Lynette,"yeah. a little.but that's okay.that's okay.we still love each other very much.but just like kids, sometimes grown-ups throw tantrums and need a time-out."
11146,Lynette,"oh, dear god."
10606,Lynette,"not here, penny.mommy's gotta change you now 'cause you stink."
10943,Lynette,"you went after my husband. if anyone should be afraid, it's you."
12504,Lynette,"well, gee, i don't know. i guess the same place that you find time for your garage band."
10736,Lynette,hi.i'm ready.
10370,Lynette,"mmm.whoa. hello.what's going on,huh?"
9962,Lynette,hey.
9496,Lynette,"okay, i love you too. bye bye."
12843,Lynette,"he's inside, but between sobs, he wished you happy driving."
9000,Lynette,how am i supposed to pull off a formal dinner with no warning?
13213,Lynette,why are you being so stubborn?
10592,Lynette,he broke his arm.they took him up to x-ray.
9439,Lynette,"well, because--"
12376,Lynette,"yeah, i can. sit down. earlier, my husband, in an attempt to help you with your relationship, mistakenly gave you some advice, which he would now like to take back. tom?"
10403,Lynette,"already?i mean,i'm sorry."
11821,Lynette,"wow, sweetie. those really look delicious, but i just don't feel like eating right now."
8939,Lynette,"seriously, how, how do you cram it all in?"
9778,Lynette,"damn. i forgot my prospectus. any extra copies? no? oh, i'll be right back."
11935,Lynette,"katherine. what's with you? sometimes you act like an ice queen, and then you do something really nice. you are one complicated lady."
10967,Lynette,isn't there anything i can do?
12008,Lynette,"lucy, lydia and i fought over who had to take her. she was right outside. god only knows what she heard us say."
11963,Lynette,i'm sorry.
12611,Lynette,liar.
12518,Lynette,"hey! everyone, this is my old assistant, stu, um--"
10103,Lynette,"yeah, they were out."
10917,Lynette,"your association with my family is over. when kayla comes to visit, you will drop her at the end of the block. you will never again see my husband, and if you try to, i will do to your spine what i just did to your front door. nod if you understand."
9885,Lynette,"great, great, no problem."
8909,Lynette,"well, you know how we both agree that one of us needs to stay home and parent the kids and one of us needs to go off and make a living. and then i suddenly remembered, when i was working i made a little more than you."
12106,Lynette,it doesn't matter. she was an amazing woman. you should respect her wishes.
11653,Lynette,what did he have to say?
9409,Lynette,"well, obviously she needs to be told."
8712,Lynette,no? i am your mother. you have to do what i say. come on.
9321,Lynette,really?
12298,Lynette,"oh, go ahead. shoot."
8823,Lynette,you look-ridiculous in that thing.
12827,Lynette,could you hold on one second?
12691,Lynette,wait. what's going on?
13002,Lynette,"mr. vivinetto, i'm not obligated to answer. it's the law."
9764,Lynette,"stu, isn't that the new video conference setup?"
10724,Lynette,"hey, i just brought two lost souls together. okay, how about this? he cheated on my friend. he deserves every bit of crazy she's gonna rain down on him."
11732,Lynette,i found it.
11322,Lynette,"honestly, i just don't feel up to going out this year."
11345,Lynette,"oh, crap. i left it at home again."
11991,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey.no, no, no. you are not leaving those here. hi, mom. take her away."
12020,Lynette,"oh, my god."
8792,Lynette,have you heard anything i just said?
12919,Lynette,"okay, you make the salads. i'll handle the register."
10633,Lynette,"i know we're using up a huge chunk of our savings, but if it keeps that crazy woman out of our life,it is the best money we have ever spent.we will be okay."
9832,Lynette,"i know things have been hard for you since i started back to work, but it is just as hard for me to be away from you. and, you just have to remember that even when i'm not around, my love for you is real. you may not be able to see it, but it's not imaginary like mrs. mulberry. it's real. okay, honey?"
11567,Lynette,"oh, hi. uh, change of plans."
10550,Lynette,"no! except that i know you've been to atlantic city three times in the last month without telling me.ed found the receipts when he did the office audit.other than that,no, nothing's wrong."
8921,Lynette,sure. whatever.
12852,Lynette,that must be nice. but--i can't accept it.
9246,Lynette,that's a good point.
8718,Lynette,"not now, honey, mommy's threatening daddy."
12142,Lynette,"hi. i'm lynette scavo. i'm a friend of bree hodge. and your sermon was lovely, especially the part about the trees."
11349,Lynette,since always. you know my closet. surely you've noticed i don't own anything orange.
9765,Lynette,"hey, nina."
10871,Lynette,"i know, i know. catering's how you get there."
9732,Lynette,"all right, fine! fine! fine! fine! ah!"
10798,Lynette,"come on, parker! keep your eye on the ball!"
12651,Lynette,"yes, i did, porter. i had to talk to anne. i didn't know that her husband was there, and he overheard us and--the doctors say she's gonna be fine. porter, wh-- where are you going? damn it!"
10601,Lynette,not ready for that yet.
11116,Lynette,"dinner's ready. kayla, i made your favorite--tacos. here you go."
12135,Lynette,"well, i haven't. i have some questions i would like answered. and i don't know anything about god or jesus, and our kids don't either."
10194,Lynette,"no, the cow part--that could work.we'll-- we'll make them into characters.we'll humanize them. oh!i know! i know!celebrity cow spokespeople!"
8879,Lynette,thank you so much.
9144,Lynette,the only reason you made love to me the other night was because you had just seen claire naked.
11794,Lynette,"yeah, in any way that gets you out of this room."
9691,Lynette,ah.
8929,Lynette,i hate playing three handed poker. let's take a break.
10708,Lynette,i'm on the side of love. you guys seem like such a perfect couple.
8997,Lynette,thanks.
11766,Lynette,"well, let's not compose my eulogy just yet. i'm still troupin'. take a card."
13067,Lynette,"um, i--edie, i have chemo in half an hour."
13036,Lynette,then do something about it. you're the president. put the brakes on lucy.
10253,Lynette,"guys, please--that's--all right."
11222,Lynette,"well, whatever it is gonna take."
12582,Lynette,that's right. you're a realtor.
12085,Lynette,"why can't we hear them? if my kids are alive, they would be yelling. tom would be yelling."
11729,Lynette,hey! hey! my wig is gone.where is it?
12437,Lynette,really? can anyone talk to him?
10316,Lynette,"oh,gosh,you got drunk,and you passed out."
11325,Lynette,we can still have sex. just try not to wake me.
9572,Lynette,it's just-
12269,Lynette,"well, good, but sometimes when you go through hard things, it changes the way you think. maybe we have trouble telling the difference between what's right and what's wrong."
12674,Lynette,i'm sure you heard about the nightclub burning down.
12906,Lynette,"i thought maybe after our conversation today, you'd realize it's time to pack it in."
12157,Lynette,"no. i just put 10 bucks in the collection plate, and i'm gonna get my money's worth."
11287,Lynette,"hey, what are you doing?"
11227,Lynette,"hey, guys."
12845,Lynette,"sadly, we can no longer afford tom's midlife crisis. okay, here's the deal. we're-- sort of broke."
11282,Lynette,okay.
13181,Lynette,"oh, right. how'd that go?"
12041,Lynette,then why not come back?
12439,Lynette,i am just--talking to porter on silverfizz.
12938,Lynette,you--ah. hey. i think you better stop with the bargain hunting unless you want your face to match the oven and the dishwasher.
10035,Lynette,"okay. i get nina, but why are you firing everybody else?"
12122,Lynette,i'm just glad we gave ida what she wanted.
11211,Lynette,"oh, deciding what to wear on my first day back to work. do i look fat in this?"
12961,Lynette,that sounds--amazing.
12446,Lynette,"oh, really?"
12468,Lynette,you need unopened mountain climbing equipment from 1986? you don't climb mountains.
10130,Lynette,"okay,let's test that theory."
13073,Lynette,i'm doing the best i can.
13098,Lynette,"sweetie, i'm home. hey."
8761,Lynette,you're kidding.
9821,Lynette,i couldn't have imagined how much going back to work would upset parker.
12710,Lynette,wait. slow down.
13013,Lynette,why?
12104,Lynette,"yeah, you stopping there anyway to spread your aunt's ashes?"
12760,Lynette,"sweetie, where are you?"
10884,Lynette,my mistake. i assumed you'd have a dream worth supporting.
12867,Lynette,yep. just adding the parmesan.
9883,Lynette,"woo! i love this song. here, hold my purse."
9650,Lynette,what does that mean?
9844,Lynette,"no, tom. she's gone."
12497,Lynette,"oh, and look, you signed it--""to lynette, the sweetest, most wonderful friend i've ever known."""
11228,Lynette,yeah--it heals a little slower when the bullet's still in there.
9441,Lynette,"yes, thank you. i know what she just said."
11939,Lynette,"you saw a possum, and you didn't tell me?"
8772,Lynette,"i-i-i didn't abandon them, i came back!"
12242,Lynette,mm-hmm?
11624,Lynette,"well, he got a better offer from some place across town."
12774,Lynette,"parker, i'm gonna be back in an hour. mr. fisherman, thank you so much."
10219,Lynette,just-- uh--could you excuse me for just a minute?
11596,Lynette,yeah. that helps.
10742,Lynette,no!
10141,Lynette,"well, he is our friendly neighborhood murderer."
9594,Lynette,"that's annabel, how ironic."
9188,Lynette,"ah. that was the best class ever. you can just terrific, thank you."
12396,Lynette,"and obviously i am not getting through to the twins, because no matter what i say, they keep pulling this crap, and i am sick of it."
10377,Lynette,"really, veronica?well, you know, there's another perk that i just thought of."
12800,Lynette,"well, we watch the kids play soccer."
10071,Lynette,"no, i am on mindy's side. she is the one caught in the middle, and i'm not letting you two have her until you calm down."
11464,Lynette,but?
10512,Lynette,"if you just fire him,he'll sue you,and i'll back him up.you need cause."
12293,Lynette,"i understand. it just seems like--at $140 an hour, we could skip straight to the part where you sit down with kayla and tell her to stop being so evil."
9623,Lynette,"i know it seems like we're ganging up on you, but you're moving so fast we thought a sort of intervention was necessary."
10261,Lynette,"you know, ed,i've been thinking.we've had a lot of fun and games around here lately,but maybe it's time to set a slightly more profession tone in the office."
11192,Lynette,"harry,my husband quit his job to start this restaurant,and if we can't sell liquor,we can't make a profit."
11564,Lynette,"yeah, a little."
9187,Lynette,"excuse me. sorry. sorry. excuse me. excuse me. hey, lauren! hi. we had a really rough morning."
13217,Lynette,"but i don't see your wrinkles, ttom. i see our whole life together. this--is you worrying about how you're going to provide for us. this is penny falling out of the tree house and breaking her arm. this is my cancer. these are the millions of laughs that got us through all those tough times. it's like a map of our marriage, and i don't want to lose it."
11630,Lynette,"well, when two people have known each other as long as mommy and daddy have, they don't have to always talk. in fact, a sign of a good relationship is being comfortable in silence."
10566,Lynette,"okay. sure.first,can i talk to jerry?"
12981,Lynette,idea--check local mental hospital for escaped married couple.
12619,Lynette,who?
8722,Lynette,yeah.
9259,Lynette,"are you sure you didn't misplace it? you're getting up there in years, no offense, but you probably forget where you put things."
9051,Lynette,i'm lynette.
11181,Lynette,i'm gonna tell him. i'm gonna tell him i went to the restaurant and that i know he screwed up and that i'm gonna fix it.
12046,Lynette,"gaby, you just got married."
10234,Lynette,ed--
10854,Lynette,mm-hmm.
12498,Lynette,ha ha ha .could i see that? i'd love to read it.
10789,Lynette,"if i threw any slower, we would be bowling."
10963,Lynette,"hey! mary alice, are you okay?"
11142,Lynette,kids. they're always rough housing.
9633,Lynette,"yeah, and he's so young, he's gonna bounce right back."
12904,Lynette,just know we're 100% behind you.
10689,Lynette,"i know you are tom, and i know love her. why else do you think i'm willing to put up with all this for six months?why do you think i'm willing to say to my college roommates, yes, that's my husband's love child and her mother in our christmas picture.because i am your wife!you always come first with me.do i still come first with you?"
10801,Lynette,"yeah, guy's a machine. who is that kid?"
11847,Lynette,"next month, so i have some time before i start feeling like total crap again. and i was hoping we could put that time to good use."
12163,Lynette,"yes, and do you know why? because out of all my friends, you are the one who had real faith. you had an actual relationship with god. at least, that's what i thought."
13309,Lynette,"yeah, that's it. give it to me."
9846,Lynette,you really think so? really?
11501,Lynette,"well, so far, she's only been charged with improper disposal of a corpse."
10543,Lynette,you know what's weird?
11625,Lynette,you sure you're ready?
10755,Lynette,"oh, that's-- delightful. that's delightful. maybe it'll just soak up the cream soda you spilled."
9859,Lynette,"oh, parker hates pepperoni. how about sausage? yeah. and a small cheese. okay, perfect. love you."
11293,Lynette,"i know. i'm the one that put in the order. i will handle anything that needs to be done. and you, take these and get some sleep."
11931,Lynette,i know that--here. but here--it feels like i've ruined their childhood.
9777,Lynette,right back.
12792,Lynette,here's a thought--stop being angry.
10017,Lynette,i can't believe you would sink so low. i'm going to ed.
10034,Lynette,he did what?
11535,Lynette,"you know, maybe i should go. um-- it's part of the job to check out the competition, right?"
12271,Lynette,good.
9361,Lynette,then it's good to know how to bluff.
10186,Lynette,"well, can't we just--"
9867,Lynette,no.
10574,Lynette,yeah?
9685,Lynette,"tom, being a mom is like being an e.r. doctor. there are no days off, so get up! get up!"
9807,Lynette,thank you for that.
13192,Lynette,"you're older? i'm sorry, i just cannot believe--that they're out of stuffed mushrooms. excuse me."
10699,Lynette,you haven't even met him. he could be the sweetest man in the world.
11157,Lynette,hey. you open in two weeks.
10238,Lynette,oh.
12875,Lynette,you want to explain this?
12934,Lynette,"well, by the end of the day, we should be able to pay off our creditors, give bree back the $20,000 that we owe her and have enough to live on for--45 minutes."
12825,Lynette,in a minute. i'm trying to lock this job down. what kind of perks are we talking about here?
11408,Lynette,"but seriously, why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint?"
12510,Lynette,"you don't have to. i'll be the bad guy. just tell 'em you've hired me, and i'll go in there, six-guns ablazing. so--do we have a deal? just give me the word."
11255,Lynette,"um, word on the street is you're looking for a manager."
10791,Lynette,i'll tell you what we're not doing--quitting.
12162,Lynette,"well, forget it. let someone else help you with your power grab."
11003,Lynette,"no, i won't. lots of mommies go to the store every day, and they're fine. it's really not a scary place."
12332,Lynette,"well, kayla loves waffles, and since she and i have been having some problems lately, i wanted to do something nice for her. oh, you tell kayla her breakfast is ready."
8950,Lynette,your sorry ass. we're throwing down.
9111,Lynette,"yep. um, i'll be home late, so just the usual routine. a nap for penny, and-"
10290,Lynette,"oh,my god!"
12388,Lynette,"oh, yeah? why didn't you play at home? why did you have to sneak in here?"
10372,Lynette,okay.
11411,Lynette,"yeah, i had that exact same thought. and to be honest, he has a history."
11347,Lynette,"listen--i was thinking, wouldn't it be better if the staff wore a uniform, and you and i wore regular clothes? that way it's like, ""hi. welcome to scavo's. we're the scavos."""
9992,Lynette,"what, um, don't you get?"
10122,Lynette,"i'm just here to say i am sorry,and i have been a complete idiot."
12591,Lynette,okay. drive safely.
10118,Lynette,"oh, yeah."
9494,Lynette,i'd invite you in but-
8978,Lynette,"oh, i'm fine. i just need some coffee."" ""thank you."
9745,Lynette,"oh, did he now?"
11328,Lynette,"okay. okay. okay. if we're doing this, i need to buy you something. what do you want?"
8876,Lynette,"the boys are fascinating. they even have their own twin secret language, don't they,tom?"
10757,Lynette,no! you're colorful.colorful in a way that might respond to medication.
11383,Lynette,how much of a while?
12976,Lynette,"so i said to him,""je crois que c'est l'homme qui fait les chez d'oeuvres."" and he said to me,""non, lynette. ce sont les chez d'oeuvres qui font l'homme."""
12514,Lynette,really?
9430,Lynette,"i'm sorry, what?"
11479,Lynette,"oh. oh, my god. if we serve this for tomorrow's special, will will clear four grand."
12408,Lynette,"are we redefining ""cool"" to include playing trombone in the marching band?"
13219,Lynette,"this isn't about me, tom. come on."
10676,Lynette,"okay, now, move it.i've got ten bucks here for the kid who can carry the most stuff. okay?"
10484,Lynette,"yeah, ""honey,you're the love of my life.she's just the runner-up."""
9390,Lynette,"oh, i'm sorry! i thought--"
9489,Lynette,you're not going to die.
11426,Lynette,what?
10686,Lynette,"nora, look, i am sorry i lied.you know you gave me no choice."
12984,Lynette,oh! mwah.
12209,Lynette,"oh, my god! that's horrible! how did it start?"
10230,Lynette,uh-huh. and how long did you stay?
11407,Lynette,which is four more than we have.
12115,Lynette,that was lovely.
12461,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god! why didn't you say something?!"
12594,Lynette,what are you saying?
12049,Lynette,"oh, yeah. you're welcome. um--can we stay in your basement?"
11254,Lynette,"you got it, ed."
11017,Lynette,okay.
12354,Lynette,"no, you'll figure something out. i have to go back to my cell."
9436,Lynette,are you sure you want to be saying these things in front of your daughter?
12372,Lynette,it's--stunning.
9865,Lynette,pals?'cause sometimes it's hard to tell. you know i wasn't feeling the love today when you mocked my campaign in front of the clients.
8755,Lynette,i accept your apology.
10733,Lynette,yeah? how can you be so sure?
9371,Lynette,of course.
12889,Lynette,yeah--i think it's a little late for that.
10926,Lynette,do you think he knows mary alice shot herself in his living room?
8859,Lynette,"guys, this isn't-"

10207,Lynette,tom? tom what?
9302,Lynette,you're going after tim doogan's promotion?
11894,Lynette,"uh, you mean katherine 's homeowners thing? yeah, i think i'll sit this one out."
10470,Lynette,"well,that doesn't matter!you gotta quit talking to people about their bodies,and about where,you know,babies come from."
12295,Lynette,"oh, well, thank you. it's beautiful. thank you."
10124,Lynette,"well, 99% wrong."

9519,Lynette,and you know what. i am going to take this.
11283,Lynette,"really. this place is your dream, so--consider them checked."
9151,Lynette,"he doesn't have a cough yet, but he sort of has this post-nasal drip thing happening."
9632,Lynette,so how are you doing?
9560,Lynette,"anyone is capable of anything. the first time we ever met, you were cheating!"
10187,Lynette,"oh, not good. i am trying to salvage the pitch from the black's frozen yogurt campaign.you know what kills me?"
11126,Lynette,i don't care. we have rules.
9495,Lynette,"ok, tom, i will swing by the dry cleaners after i hit the market. um, i don't know, porter has a dentist appointment at 4 o' clock, so the, um, car might have to wait until tomorrow."
12595,Lynette,how do you know he didn't?
11109,Lynette,"good.yeah, okay.so give her some room.hey,wow,look,are those presents for kayla?yes,they are."
11204,Lynette,you can't drown in self-pity just because i helped you with one tiny little thing.
10178,Lynette,hey.
11553,Lynette,"gaby, she asked me to make twenty pizzas. i couldn't turn it down."
13288,Lynette,please tell me that's not a purple wall clock. pack your bags. we're moving.
10658,Lynette,"no, that's fine.wow, white gloves.what are we having lunch in the 1880s."
10660,Lynette,she said coyly.
12894,Lynette,"so now we have pretend customers? gee, let's think of something to do with all the pretend money we're gonna make."
13035,Lynette,"isn't she fun? hey, carlos. did i ever tell you that tom a i seriously considered you and gaby for penny's godparents?"
10661,Lynette,wow!
9118,Lynette,"i know. the way she was talking about mrs. huber, it was like she was already dead."
12554,Lynette,hi. my husband--i'm lynette scavo. dr. baron called me--
12482,Lynette,"hey, is everything all right? oh, my!"
9824,Lynette,maybe i can change my work schedule. try to get some flex time.
12467,Lynette,why are there two piles?
13059,Lynette,"eh, same."
11600,Lynette,tom! in here!
11185,Lynette,oh!
10217,Lynette,"well, honestly,i wasn't blown away."
9985,Lynette,i'm just trying to prove a point.
11758,Lynette,yeah.that's rough.by the way--i have cancer.
9023,Lynette,thanks!
11759,Lynette,"so i am halfway through chemo,and my doctor is very confident that i'm going to beat this,so you can all relax.i'm not going to die."
12808,Lynette,"i wish i could say the same for my uterus. oh, yeah. i ruined the brunch."
9782,Lynette,ladies' room.
9185,Lynette,"hi, sorry."
12966,Lynette,i know. so what kind of starting salary are we talking about?
11883,Lynette,yeah.
12047,Lynette,you can't be serious.
10822,Lynette,"i just figured, since you're taking your time figuring out what your dream even is, you might wanna make a few bucks in the meantime. i have a dream, too. it includes keeping this house."
10548,Lynette,"yeah, how, indeed?"
12857,Lynette,"it wouldn't be a loan or a gift. it would be--an investment that would buy you, say--15% of scavo's."
9112,Lynette,"you're the best. oh, one more thing. since the boys are having corn dogs for dinner, i'd like you to make sure they get a vegetable to go with it."
10188,Lynette,"here we are at ""t"" minus 9 hours and 11 minutes from the biggest pitch in our company's history,and i have nothing even vaguely presentable."
9269,Lynette,"no. i can deal with the humiliation of going around the neighborhood returning everything the boys stole, but please don't make me apologize to that woman."
10055,Lynette,yeah.
9283,Lynette,i don't know.
11239,Lynette,"no, they're probably from zach young."
8857,Lynette,now open up.
12483,Lynette,how in the world did that happen?
9119,Lynette,"you know, if we're going to buy a water heater, we should talk about it. we could go to the mall tomorrow. they're having a sale."
8906,Lynette,"boys,could you stop?"
11220,Lynette,"well, you know, hire someone else."
11592,Lynette,"no, i mean--everything--the food, the wine--you. i swear, there are times this is all that gets me through my day, knowing at the end of it, i get to steal this little half-hour where i'm not a mom or a wife or a--pizza slave. i'm just a--tired lady with a nice man who cooks for her."
10481,Lynette,yeah?
10333,Lynette,"so you want me to,uh--pitch you as parents?"
9043,Lynette,ten. ten! each one more incompetent than the last. one actually asked me--here you go --if she was expected to change diapers.
11520,Lynette,oh. okay.
8711,Lynette,"you three planned this?? alright, that's it. get out!"
11690,Lynette,mom--
9031,Lynette,that's what's so humiliating. other moms don't need help. other moms make it look so easy. all i do is complain.
10639,Lynette,my sincerest apologies.
10196,Lynette,the talking cows rocked their world.
8933,Lynette,"oh, yeah, huh, it was a creative call. look, i'm in the middle of a costume crisis, and if i don't take a few shortcuts, i'll never finish."
10558,Lynette,i got my boarding pass.
9398,Lynette,why?
10992,Lynette,"okay, listen, kids. i am sorry. we shouldn't have lied, but sometimes parents wanna protect the kids from scary things."
12597,Lynette,"tom, where are you?"
12133,Lynette,tom--i'm serious.
12127,Lynette,"well, we heard you were having a rough time."
11586,Lynette,okay.
9163,Lynette,"oh, actually, she yelled at me for not bringing my garbage cans in."
10092,Lynette,what do you mean?
9827,Lynette,that'll fix everything? hugs?
12435,Lynette,"hey, parker. can i ask you something, just between us? does porter hang out with jimmy conrado?"
12925,Lynette,"tom, it's fine. i'll take the table."
12596,Lynette,no.
9983,Lynette,"uh, no. actually, i need you to kidnap my children."
9963,Lynette,i'm home. could you come here a sec?
11396,Lynette,love you!
9831,Lynette,"well, isn't she nice. it's time for bed, so i'm gonna tuck you in, okay?"
9679,Lynette,"okay, let's get outta here. tom?"
10650,Lynette,nora.
13183,Lynette,it's a social networking tool where you send instant updates to anybody who signs up for them.
9374,Lynette,"i'm begging you. they've already been uninvited from a birthday party, a really big birthday party with a bouncy house and a hot dog stand and a clown."
9136,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
8854,Lynette,not exactly. this is a special kind of medicine.
10651,Lynette,uh.what are you doing there?
9097,Lynette,"well, what's wrong?"
9878,Lynette,"chuck, i'm gonna stop you right there."
9189,Lynette,hi!
9534,Lynette,"talk to peterson, maybe he can get her transferred. weren't you guys talking about setting something up in belize?"
9271,Lynette,"if our house catches fire i guarantee you, she's the one that started it."
9774,Lynette,"oh, hey, honey, this is so exciting. your first day of school. you're going to make so many friends."
9056,Lynette,"well, if we had a nanny like you at my house, we would treat her like gold. did i mention i have four very loveable kids?"
11490,Lynette,sometimes.
10180,Lynette,what happened?
12797,Lynette,poor eli. we should make sure he's got flowers at his funeral.
10082,Lynette,"yeah, i am.i don't--i don't want to make a big deal out of it,but, uh,could you maybe not do that again?"
10584,Lynette,"well, don't encourage him."
12769,Lynette,ah.
11842,Lynette,i get it. but if you ever pull something like this again--
11767,Lynette,you're doing it again.
11879,Lynette,"this--is me, tom, not brandy or candy. it's just your wife, lynette. am i not enough for you?"
8853,Lynette,we'll talk about that later. right now i need you to take some medicine.
12445,Lynette,"okay, okay. you're right. you're right."
13102,Lynette,"mm. i just took a shower, and i know where you're going with this--"
11965,Lynette,no. this is about the baby.
11439,Lynette,oh? what's wrong with it?
9170,Lynette,"okay, mommy's friends are gone now and you can -"
12568,Lynette,"well, sheesh. oh. sweetie, we already got karen a candle. an r.v. might be overkill."
11809,Lynette,"yeah, i am feeling much better, so count me in. will our new neighbor be coming?"
9446,Lynette,"oh, please."
12050,Lynette,"well, if this tornado watch gets upgraded to warning, we're gonna need a place to wait it out."
10286,Lynette,"have they signed the contract?'cause if not,somebody should call bednark and tell them to adjust the language."
10108,Lynette,"i never said that.what i said was that it made me uncomfortable when you kissed him.it's obviously an issue for me.and yet, here you are, alone in my kitchen with my husband.so you tell me,are you hitting on him?"
9590,Lynette,"oh , ha ha ha. not funny, tom."
12956,Lynette,and brush your teeth. my eyes are watering. and don't just wet the toothbrush. i can tell.
10012,Lynette,and i'm gonna take your parking space.
8832,Lynette,"they don't have attention-deficit disorder, and i'm not going to drug my boys just to make your job easier. i'd rather change teachers."
10077,Lynette,we've got day care!
12212,Lynette,need a little caffeine fix?
13097,Lynette,"yeah, 'cause he hasn't suffered enough."
9561,Lynette,it's a pattern of behaviour.
12610,Lynette,what's wrong with you? you've been antsy all night.
8763,Lynette,"well, like i said, i should go back and get dinner ready."
9725,Lynette,"no, i can't respect that, and do you know why? it's stupid. i'm gonna get new sheets."
10195,Lynette,"hey,i got great news!we just landed the black's frozen yogurt account!"
11098,Lynette,"oh! of course! i feel just terrible. i mean, if you knew, if you could just know how sorry i am."
9141,Lynette,"oh, how can you say, she was so your type, big breasts, really curvy."
13044,Lynette,"okay, yes, carlos and i spoke briefly, but i thought he blew me off."
11053,Lynette,i want my son.
12681,Lynette,"oh. listen, we need to talk."
12945,Lynette,thank you. this will really cheer tom up.
13107,Lynette,at work.
11476,Lynette,what's this?
8795,Lynette,so did mike say anything?
10205,Lynette,yeah?
9416,Lynette,that's telling him.
11735,Lynette,yes.it proves they eat sitting down.
12602,Lynette,why can't you do that at home? what the hell is this? you moving out on me?
9904,Lynette,oh. thanks.
10062,Lynette,you're mindy's father. you have a right to spend time with her.
11531,Lynette,such food exists? don't tease me.
9339,Lynette,tammy brennan spent a fortune on topher's party. she'd call in specialists from switzerland before she'd let it be canceled.
10810,Lynette,"oh, my god! yes!"
11356,Lynette,"focus, people! the subject is shirts. it's killing morale."
12438,Lynette,"and, uh--how would somebody make that happen?"
11917,Lynette,why don't you get earplugs?
10608,Lynette,i said i wanted penny.
12963,Lynette,"yes, like the greatest city in the world."
12442,Lynette,"well, the good news is he really doesn't hang out with jimmy conrado. but i am a little worried about anita47, who told him cherry fruit pops are an aphrodisiac."
9697,Lynette,could you excuse me for a minute?
9613,Lynette,"tom, i don't care about you working with annabel. i told you that. this is for duggan. he had a heart attack. i don't care about annabel."
10652,Lynette,"tom, could i, could i check your tie again?"
10948,Lynette,shh! she told us not to talk.
11335,Lynette,who could that be? here.
12108,Lynette,"look, you're taking her pearls. the least you can do is honor her wishes."
12635,Lynette,"but one day, you are gonna meet someone more--appropriate. someone who want the same things that you do out of life. then you are gonna know what real love is. and when you do, i hope you will finally see where i am coming from."
12211,Lynette,whatcha doing?
12337,Lynette,"okay--first, i'm not that kind of mom. and second, kayla has a tendency to--exaggerate."
10969,Lynette,"hey.hey!oh, my gosh! you didn't have to do this!hi!"
10759,Lynette,"no, well, it wasn't funny. if you wanna kill yourself, fine, but don't take me with you."
11893,Lynette,"got it. sick talk done, okay? you guys have fun."
11639,Lynette,"oh, sure, now and then."
11245,Lynette,"this restaurant is gonna be a big, fat hit."
9609,Lynette,no. nononono.
9812,Lynette,what are you doing?
9217,Lynette,how could you do something like this to alison?
8730,Lynette,"oh my god, oh my, oh!"
9388,Lynette,"well, why are you standing there? get to it."
12522,Lynette,"no, i-- also went into business for myself."
9729,Lynette,being too lazy to change the sheets is not a principle.
9925,Lynette,don't worry.
10439,Lynette,there's a gift receipt taped to the bottom of the box.
10647,Lynette,kayla ready yet?
12447,Lynette,aw. that's sweet.
11721,Lynette,you're leaving tomorrow. i don't want your money. i don't want you imy house.
10538,Lynette,hey. hey!i didn't know if you were coming back.
13131,Lynette,"drop it, tom. we'll continue this at home."
12441,Lynette,our brooding son has a classmate who got arrested for selling drugs. i really think the end justifies the means here.
12261,Lynette,"mm, no. i think it goes a little further than that. i think we have a seriously troubled young girl. she needs--professional help."
11736,Lynette,"okay,don't take this personally,but we hate you."
11376,Lynette,"listen to me. i forbid you to die. if you leave me with a mortgage and a restaurant and five kids, i swear i will track you into the deepest pit of hell and make you pay. do you hear me? come on, baby--oh, please."
11366,Lynette,i told you orange meant something bad was gonna happen.
10222,Lynette,"you want the truth, tom?i think you're good.you have moments of brilliance.but i also think sometimes you coast.and i think if i were your boss and had to ride your ass every day,you would come home seething with resentment.come on! it's hard enough keeping a marriage together."
9028,Lynette,"no, no, i'm sorry, i can't do this. it's just too much. boys, you stay with your aunt susan."
9503,Lynette,"yes, and it was a beautiful gesture. really. but i-"
13272,Lynette,how long have you been sniffing those markers? of course with a baby.
10125,Lynette,"anyway, tom's probably got dinner ready by now.so i should get goin'."
11744,Lynette,i'm feeling a little.
13194,Lynette,"i know, right? he must take care of himself."
12054,Lynette,we can be quiet--relative to the storm.
9165,Lynette,hi. come on in.
9542,Lynette,it'll be worth it. you're doing an amazing job.
11377,Lynette,"so that's it? he threw out his back? oh, thank god."
13297,Lynette,"uh-huh. is that why you didn't open the door? because of your hands? mrs mcclusky, do you have anyone who could help you out? a relative? a friend?"
12683,Lynette,"did you set that fire at the nightclub? before you answer, let me say that if you did, i promise, your father and i will stand behind you and try and find some way out of this nightmare. but if you lie to me, and i find out later that you--killed--those people--well, i will love you. that will never change, but i won't believe in you anymore, and if i--don't believe in you--i can't help you. we have to tell each other the truth from here on out."
11765,Lynette,"hey, i told you i'm collecting queens. pay attention."
12460,Lynette,"what? no, i didn't."
9225,Lynette,that's it?
8966,Lynette,you think? how am i supposed to pull off a formal dinner with no warning?
10129,Lynette,"well, well--yes,i overreacted.i think you can see how even though i was somewhat off base,you were a little wrong,right?"
12440,Lynette,me. i'm 16 and cute. i like graphic novels and tokyo police club.
11675,Lynette,is one of them cancer?
11486,Lynette,sure.
10833,Lynette,"okay, well, maybe a little."
9464,Lynette,"so help me, if you don't back me up on this i will lose it."
12755,Lynette,and you will convince him to come back home. shut the door.
9918,Lynette,i'm so sorry. did my sons beat you up?
9980,Lynette,"hey, stu. you busy?"
12967,Lynette,"okay. bruce, could you hold that thought? i'm gonna be right back."
12107,Lynette,"hey, i-if you don't have time to do it, i will."
9991,Lynette,"and we integrated the corporate logo into the jungle background creating not only an ad for the clothing, but for the company, itself."
11183,Lynette,"mr. gaunt? hi, i'm lynette scavo. my husband is opening the pizzeria right down the block--"
11602,Lynette,"yeah. no, i'm fine."
10299,Lynette,come on out.
11910,Lynette,"hey, a tumor is a tumor whether it's in your body or living across the street."

9131,Lynette,want some coffee?
11960,Lynette,why?
11905,Lynette,"tom, i don't want your opinion, just your vote."
11538,Lynette,"all right, i'll see you later."
9465,Lynette,"that is not the point, you don't spank other people's children."
11378,Lynette,how much of a while?
10744,Lynette,so?
13068,Lynette,i'm not supposed to drink.
9661,Lynette,"aah! no! no! no, nobody touches mommy, okay? i love you, i love your finger painting, but if you touch me with those messy hands, i will cut them off."
11149,Lynette,"well, you could tuck me in."
12538,Lynette,"you know, when i had a high-powered career, and you were just a housewife, i never looked down on you."
12663,Lynette,"well, i was right there, detective. my son said no such thing."
12665,Lynette,"you might wanna go ahead and give him those pain pills, doc. he's gonna need them."
11224,Lynette,"i can't call in sick after eight weeks of sick leave, especially when i've been fine for three of them."
13189,Lynette,really?
11547,Lynette,no! go ride the python! come on.
9125,Lynette,tom--come on.
9360,Lynette,"what do friends do? they call, they're sympathetic, they ask about the pain the other person is going through, and then they listen."
13017,Lynette,"the problem--how to attract high net worth clients in a down economy. the solution? be creative. christie's is hosting its first ever ""sea auction"" on a yacht in st. barths. i see a boat full of millionaires waiting to be wooed."
10629,Lynette,"well, it's that or the kids' college fund.we'll write nora one big check, and in return, she'll sign away her claim for the back child support. if we're lucky, she'll take the bird in the hand."
10921,Lynette,okay. see you later.
12973,Lynette,i-- ugh!
10654,Lynette,"no, i am sorry.how much of her crap do i have to put up with?first it's little drop bys, than she's inviting herself to dinner three times a week.now she wants to be in our christmas photo? i'm sorry, no, that is not happening."

9454,Lynette,"oh for god's sake bree, i'm wearing panty-hose."
11400,Lynette,my fault for asking.
10096,Lynette,"bree, come on, just tell me."
10341,Lynette,"tom,if you're gonna make a point,why don't you do it now before i hurl the plate at you?"
9898,Lynette,"whoa, hold on a sec."
9928,Lynette,"guys, what is this?"
9760,Lynette,"actually, your dad's gonna take you to school on your first day."
11523,Lynette,why would you say that?
9013,Lynette,"oh, for the love of god!"

10251,Lynette,"i'm sorry,i thought we were here to talk about the farm fresh rollout?"
10256,Lynette,"that's because ed gets off on humiliating you.please, don't do this!"
10838,Lynette,how the hell did he do that?
11028,Lynette,"what are you, his lawyer? you have to admit, it's odd."
10166,Lynette,i can't believe you've actually thought about this!
11574,Lynette,okay.
9687,Lynette,"oh, for god sakes!"
9816,Lynette,oh. that must have been ugly.
8965,Lynette,tom
10200,Lynette,"well, to be fair--"
13299,Lynette,"okay, great. like your dad said, it's time for bed."
10466,Lynette,that is ridiculous.
12584,Lynette,"well--it's a little dumb, but compared to what i was thinking--"
11686,Lynette,so where are we gonna find this ten thousand dollars?
10787,Lynette,"it is not fake. there is not a team i know that could get along without their backup far right fielder. okay, come on, let's go practice."
10842,Lynette,"wow, you're pretty good at that."
12593,Lynette,"not a bed-- a futon, like a couch."

11279,Lynette,"well, kinda."
9589,Lynette,"okay, off!"
9237,Lynette,"i know, of course. you're not your father."
13048,Lynette,"oh, sweetie, those aren't to play with, not unless you wanna see someone go completely bonkers. actually, they do look like a lot of fun. if only i had the power to stop you--"
12411,Lynette,"i just need five seconds to bitch about tom, and then i'll-- oh, my god. your painter isn't done yet?"
9143,Lynette,"aww--you kiss as though that would end this conversation, and it so won't."
8887,Lynette,"yes, yes, come on!"
13210,Lynette,"isn't it exciting, tom? in a few weeks, you are gonna look just like bruce."
9290,Lynette,i thought you liked tim doogan.
12138,Lynette,"okay. well, i'll be right back. oh, this is so exciting. i'm going to church. by the way, what am i now?"
12829,Lynette,"i'm sorry. is there any way we could finish this conversation tomorrow? l-l-later in the day works better for me, too. well, thank you very much. bye."
9819,Lynette,uh huh.
9079,Lynette,"yeah? well, brussel sprouts help you grow. you don't want to be short your whole life, do you? here, look, you know what we'll do? we're gonna dip them in a little cheese. here you go. good, yummy!"
11039,Lynette,oh! good.
11395,Lynette,"at some point, tom's gonna ask you to look for this. you will not find it."
12150,Lynette,what isn't my fault?
9901,Lynette,"you saw the walk, right? you wanna see the walk again? i'll tutor parker myself."
9340,Lynette,"because she saw porter scratching his head at school. they all did, and now word's getting around."
11850,Lynette,"well, it's just like riding a bike. you never forget. now start pedaling. hey. hey. what are you doing?"
11031,Lynette,it was a thank you cake. he sort of saved my life.
10158,Lynette,"hey,guys."
10415,Lynette,i don't know why i have to get dragged into this.what happened with my kids has nothing to do with bree's situation with andrew.sit.
13034,Lynette,"um, i have a tiny scheduling conflict. i coach my daughter's basketball team on friday nights. so if i could--"
11801,Lynette,"gaby, this was a wonderful idea. i cannot tell you how much it means to me."
9475,Lynette,i will walk you over to mrs van der camp's and we all know what happens when she gets mad.
11731,Lynette,"hey,i'm coming!hey,don't just lie there like a lump!come on! help me look!"
8940,Lynette,"um, sure."
11498,Lynette,i've knocked twice. she's not answering.
11242,Lynette,"until he turned eighteen, which was a month ago."
12462,Lynette,"you said it was great. way to bury the lead, tom! tom, don't you dare!"
12503,Lynette,"well, maybe i'm the lucky one. this could be a perfect way for me to stick my toe back in the business. nothing big, maybe just pick up some freelance work."
9719,Lynette,i did. i had to load the dishwasher.
11709,Lynette,"nothing. same old, same old."
11202,Lynette,"okay, let's say just for the sake of argument, that someone else did. someone who clearly loves you very much. what's wrong with that?"
9063,Lynette,i guess he does have a sort of dorky charm.
11727,Lynette,"i know it's her wedding night,but do you think we should call gaby?"
9728,Lynette,why are you fighting so hard to sleep on baby vomit?
9569,Lynette,"oh, that's fine. i wanted to talk to you about something."
11856,Lynette,"oh, okay."
11248,Lynette,"i'm gonna go poach some customers from that sausage-on-a-stick guy. oh, i love it. scavo's pizzeria! try the smoked chicken and sundried tomato."
12603,Lynette,"so you can have your affair--you know, the one that follows the sports car and the garage band and wanting to quit your job, the final stage of your midlife crisis. oh, and then--when i hear anne schilling has been dropping by--"
10834,Lynette,you get to chase your dream while i get to spend the rest of my life in advertising.
13104,Lynette,"ooh. whining-- that's hot. fine. let's have sex. but i warn you, i'm just gonna lie here, resenting you the whole time, waiting for this hell to be over."
10378,Lynette,"how can they not?for working parents like you and me, it's a necessity.so is the pot getting sweeter?"
12431,Lynette,so i assume you know about what happened to jimmy conrado.
12484,Lynette,"now i'm sure it was an accident, tom. please don't yell at her."
9270,Lynette,"but why do i have to apologize? why don't we just go: ""oh, now we're even"" and we'll start from scratch."
11081,Lynette,"we're not gonna play cards, are we?"
9036,Lynette,"that is so like you, edie. you're always thinking of others."
11090,Lynette,"yep. go ahead, say it. i know you want to."
11919,Lynette,"katherine, what are you up to?"
13031,Lynette,"okay, it's true. i used you to get more money, but you used me first."
10925,Lynette,"and that's what i did, nothing."
12515,Lynette,she won't be glowing when that agency sinks her book.
11532,Lynette,and--and--and you want me to go with you?
8972,Lynette,"big fun. say, you wouldn't have any of your kids add medication that you could spare just to get me over the hump?"
12012,Lynette,you're waiting outside. why are you waiting outside?
12848,Lynette,it's okay. just keep it under your hat. it's a little embarrassing.
10019,Lynette,you threatening me?
10203,Lynette,hi.
12756,Lynette,"sweetie, where are you?"
12502,Lynette,"you know, it's been years since i looked through this stuff. i'd forgotten i was--kinda great."
11860,Lynette,"after two months of puking my guts out, last night i was finally in the mood, but tomnot so much. apparently, my bald head is a big turnoff for him."
10049,Lynette,"oh, well, come on in my office."
10998,Lynette,or wherever.
12140,Lynette,i've got a question about his sermon.
11440,Lynette,"all right, all right. i will put you order in. but the kitchen's a little backed up."
12035,Lynette,why didn't you tell me?
10705,Lynette,right.
9574,Lynette,we started to but then *huh* you fell asleep.
9277,Lynette,hey.
10663,Lynette,that's cute.
9578,Lynette,"okay, you boys, it's seven o'clock. time for bed."
12343,Lynette,"oh, susan. he's adorable."
10383,Lynette,"oh,shoot,i gotta take this one.i'm sorry. it's tom."
10877,Lynette,it's a dump! what are you thinking?
10442,Lynette,"so,um--your message said that parker had been involved in some sort of serious incident.what--what kind of incident?"
10641,Lynette,"as the mother of 80% of tom's children, i don't think it's in their best interest for you to drive us into bankruptcy."
10066,Lynette,"hey! you know, the day care room won't be ready until next week at the earliest."
11320,Lynette,"before i forget, you got a call from chez nous confirming your reservation for our anniversary."
10267,Lynette,"aw, what's wrong, ed?you afraid a phi kap's gonna get beaten by a girl?come on, big man--it's just a little bet."
9174,Lynette,"- sorry, we end saying and doing things which we don't normally do."
9750,Lynette,yep.
10356,Lynette,"oh,that's ridiculous."
10284,Lynette,okay. sorry.
10518,Lynette,"okay,well--remember i was helping ed spark up his love life?"
10336,Lynette,i don't suppose you brought a corkscrew?
11878,Lynette,and that's only possible when you're pretending i'm someone else?
11924,Lynette,have i got your vote?
10713,Lynette,"oh, there are other urologists in the world. go back to that other guy."
8919,Lynette,i'm lynette scavo. my twins just joined. they're playing oak trees.
12833,Lynette,yeah?
10826,Lynette,"just one more game.he'll suck, the other kids will taunt him, and he'll wanna quit again.see, everybody wins."
11489,Lynette,okay. i'm off.
9658,Lynette,"oh, why on earth would you let them finger paint before breakfast?"
10086,Lynette,i just said it bugged me.why is that a problem?
12960,Lynette,yeah.
9471,Lynette,"no, no. i'll fish it out later, alright.? you're off the hook for tonight, but not you two so start brushing. preston did you not hear me? i said start brushing your teeth."
13250,Lynette,"okay, whoa, whoa, easy. you're a little drunk there."
9857,Lynette,are those the same clothes you were wearing last night in the bar?
13040,Lynette,i brought you a little gift.
12304,Lynette,could we revisit the foam bat idea for just a second?
12090,Lynette,"oh, my god."
9702,Lynette,"well, then watch me multitask."
11557,Lynette,i might take a little for tom and--
13178,Lynette,no. no.
12471,Lynette,hey.
10127,Lynette,"you know what the 1% is, right?"
9740,Lynette,"well, i'm very sorry for your loss, too, phyllis."
11257,Lynette,he did. i told him i wasn't interested.
13117,Lynette,"hey, carlos, quick question for ya. last thing i remember, i was in the shower, naked, reaching for the soap. then i was here on the bed, under a blanket--still naked. and my question is, how did i get from there to here?"
10169,Lynette,"yeah,well,why don't you have your second wife make you lunch,okay? oops!"
9930,Lynette,"well, it's stuck. get the remote! get the remote!"
13273,Lynette,"well, apparently, not old enough."
10880,Lynette,don't tell me. you didn't sign a lease.
9940,Lynette,okay.
12990,Lynette,congratulations. you're now dating a lesbian.
8839,Lynette,oh.. which one goes and which one stays?
10148,Lynette,what? why? i called.the machine kept picking up.
10021,Lynette,great.
11522,Lynette,what?
9749,Lynette,"it was good, but, more importantly, how was yours?"
11037,Lynette,hold on.
10964,Lynette,okay. i'll see you later.
9907,Lynette,"good morning. hi. i'm lynette scavo. now is everyone taken care of in terms of coffee and whatever else they may like? great. well, then, let's get started. i will show you how kamarov vodka can expand its customer mindshare while still holding the line on marketing costs. it's something we here at percher and murphy like to call ""persuasive engineering."""
12088,Lynette,hi!
8728,Lynette,i wasn't expecting you for a week!
8973,Lynette,"yeah, that's exciting. i wish my sister would visit more often."
9910,Lynette,"but then i started thinking about it, and you know what? i'll be damned if i'm gonna pitch to a roomful of people who are all wearing armani and vera wang, while i'm standing there with two-year-old breast milk crusted on my lapel."
12818,Lynette,"oh, please. you know it's gonna be a boy. it's always a boy. it's just gonna pee in my face and hide dead things in my shoes. i am doing this, tom. i am going after this job."
11888,Lynette,"oh, i'd like that."
11348,Lynette,"oh, good point. okay, here's another good point: i hate orange."
9379,Lynette,"yeah, sure, boys. have fun."
12524,Lynette,mm-hmm. oh.
11852,Lynette,"oh, i ripped it this morning. it's been itching the hell out of me--and this is much better."
11662,Lynette,nothing was going on! he never touched me!
9397,Lynette,you're a better woman than me. i would have ripped that open with my teeth. aren't you dying to know what he wrote?
10985,Lynette,i'm gonna make you a cake.
12318,Lynette,no. all my idea. i just wanted to treat you to a real fun day.
12038,Lynette,are you kidding? it would've changed everything.
9905,Lynette,i don't follow you.
12955,Lynette,you're grieving. i get it. but this sounds like a fantastic job. please just hear the guy out and make a nice--impression.
11233,Lynette,"oh, son of a bi*ch!"
10330,Lynette,are you saying you gave your heart and soul to that eskimo pitch?
11066,Lynette,"i know! if something happened to someone's kid because i kept my mouth shut--the thing is, i promised tom i'd back off."
10209,Lynette,"you have a real job, right here staying home with the kids."
13029,Lynette,"because you used me! at least when i asked you for a favor, i was up-front."
12217,Lynette,"right, right. it's just--if anyone thinks you did, it'd be handy if you could prove them wrong, wouldn't it?"
12189,Lynette,"oh, i've been unwashed for years."
10152,Lynette,"well,tom,somebody's gotta take care of our kids."
10358,Lynette,"i am so sorry you feel that way,but you cannot put that on me.this is your life.you wanna run it?"
9543,Lynette,"look, you're basically a predator and i need your advice."
12312,Lynette,"she did, so you can kiss that little blackmail scheme good-bye."
9155,Lynette,"yeah, i noticed that, but every time i come here, it's full."
11275,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry, but you totally blindsided me out there."
10277,Lynette,thanks.follow me.you're part of the thing.
11941,Lynette,"i can't eat right now, tom. i've got to go to the garden center and get some fencing. god, this is annoying! can't believe you didn't tell me we have a possum!"
11315,Lynette,"yes, you did. but i have customers."
10266,Lynette,"yes, you're right.this is your company,so i'll play by your rules.what do i have to do to get you to stop this frat boy crap?shave my eyebrows?come to work naked?name your stakes."
12387,Lynette,what the hell's going on here?
12652,Lynette,"excuse me. gaby, have you seen porter?"
12814,Lynette,yeah. whoop-dee-doo.
11655,Lynette,"remember when i was giving birth to the twins and screaming in agony because porter was dragging my uterus out with him? well, i was more in the mood for sex then than i am now."
9838,Lynette,"i mean this is conjecture on my part, but it is possible that someone like little spencer needs mrs. mulberry more 'cause he doesn't have a daddy and a mommy who love him. yeah, that's it. he's an orphan with no hands. okay?"
10063,Lynette,"you could stand up to fran. if you don't, you'll just become more resentful, she'll get nuttier. and without a father figure, poor mindy will grow up to be a stripper."
11866,Lynette,that's too bad. i had a little fantasy thing planned of my own.
9950,Lynette,ah.
12198,Lynette,"thank you. oh, oh, hey, honey. could you hold back a sec?"
12165,Lynette,really? okay. how?
8765,Lynette,"boys, i am not gonna tell you again, sit. i mean it, i am serious. you guys are gonna be in so much trouble if you don't sit back in those seats."
10513,Lynette,so you think you and carlos will try for another adoption?
10862,Lynette,"no, not really."
9129,Lynette,oh.
11979,Lynette,"oh, you know her, always busy."
12196,Lynette,i didn't go into work that night.
9235,Lynette,"you're right. you're right. i guess i just got so upset because - oh, whatever, let's not beat a dead horse, it's over, i'm sorry, good night."
11702,Lynette,if you would just try to understand--
9207,Lynette,"in the future, checklist means 'is it in the car' not like, 'do you remember', okay?"
11845,Lynette,you remembered.
11401,Lynette,rick coletti?
10846,Lynette,"oh, my god! you know what you wanna do! that's fantastic! what is it?"
12870,Lynette,"bree, no one will notice. parmesan is the fourth cheese in a four cheese pizza. it's the ringo of these cheeses."
11386,Lynette,"yeah, but don't worry. i am gonna find you the assistant manager of your dreams."
10624,Lynette,business?
10498,Lynette,"for god's sakes,it's not brain surgery.is she still online?"
9527,Lynette,three months?
12427,Lynette,"no, listen. this is important. when they were little and they'd act out, and we'd always say, ""relax! they're young. when they're older, they'll get it."" well, tom, they're 16 now. not getting it. we have a lot of work to do in a very short time, and if you and i aren't in sync, i'm afraid it's not gonna happen."
9570,Lynette,"that's your car pool. you've got to go, never mind."
11601,Lynette,we were robbed!
9065,Lynette,"oh, she never showed up, somebody's got to take her place."
12004,Lynette,going?
10635,Lynette,"sorry, that's penny's baby monitor.it's always picking up weird frequencies."
11057,Lynette,"did you donate the photos, too? parker!"
11301,Lynette,yes.
9944,Lynette,"hi. sorry for just showing up unannounced, but, um, could we talk to you for a minute?"
10578,Lynette,"yeah. no, wait. actually, wait.this is perfect.you know why? because we need some impartial judges."
11288,Lynette,"oh, honey, you have had, what, four hours sleep in the past three days? you need rest. who cares if we run out of breadsticks?"
11887,Lynette,you suck. well--i guess i could give candy a whirl. are the kids really asleep? 'cause i think she might be a screamer.
9157,Lynette,"i hope someday, you have lots of children."
11506,Lynette,aren't you sweet? what's that noise in the background? are the boys still up?
9316,Lynette,"yeah, he certainly did."
10162,Lynette,"see you later.i'm sorry,what did he mean,""shooting blanks""?"
12644,Lynette,"warren, i'm sorry that"
10379,Lynette,parcher & murphy is completely mother-friendly.no one would say a word.
11445,Lynette,i'm gonna be right there. here you go.
11666,Lynette,this whole thing is ridiculous. i bumped my head.
8980,Lynette,dana. wow. dana was a baby.
11654,Lynette,and what would that have to do with me?
13228,Lynette,i want you to get this stupid europe idea out of his head. take him on a tour of the campus. get him excited. show him college could be fun.
11881,Lynette,"escape from me, you mean?"
12454,Lynette,"okay-- remember how you told me i should stop talking to him online? well, of course, i didn't, and i sort of told him i liked his poetry."
11582,Lynette,"actually, he is bringing in more than enough business to cover his salary. i mean, with all those new dishes he's been cooking, he's got a lot of fans out there."
12037,Lynette,i don't think that's how it works.
9254,Lynette,do you know what physiological warfare means?
8799,Lynette,honey. get a pet. see ya. son of a-?
12025,Lynette,why? mom cheated on you. no one blames you for leaving.
12673,Lynette,i hear you're getting discharged today. are you going back home?
10752,Lynette,"ah, how far is the impound lot because, you know, i would just drive you over there--"
8800,Lynette,it's a frat party.
11174,Lynette,"i think it's fantastic. it's really coming together. ooh, i love the bar."
10648,Lynette,no problem.she's a great little girl.
11308,Lynette,"okay, that brings us to 22. javi, rico, we got chairs to find. move it."
12749,Lynette,"okay, we'll get a - we'll get a restraining order."
12380,Lynette,answer him.
10343,Lynette,"okay.so if i apologize for upsetting you at work,can we get past it and enjoy our meal?"
9453,Lynette,"please hear me out, this is important. today i have a chance to rejoin the human race for a few hours, there are actual adults waiting for me with margaritas.look i'm in a dress, i have make up on."
12214,Lynette,is that where you were during bree's acceptance speech - doing free shots at the bar?
9206,Lynette,sexism.
10354,Lynette,"okay,okay,can i just mention you're talking like a crazy person?"
8771,Lynette,"i have 4 kids under the age of six, i absolutely have anger management issues."
10614,Lynette,i will stop as soon as you promise.
10549,Lynette,i didn't say anything.
9108,Lynette,huh.
9896,Lynette,"yeah, well, i haven't bought a new suit in six years."
12819,Lynette,"well, i was hoping you could cut back on your hours at work."
11427,Lynette,you wanna have sex? but you're immobile.
12105,Lynette,you can't do that. ida wanted her ashes scattered at the field.
12550,Lynette,"oh. penny. if you're thinking of taking that for a spin, i've got bad news. you're 9. hey, what's the matter, sweetie?"
9473,Lynette,"preston, don't listen to them. back away from the toilet and no one gets hurt."
12993,Lynette,absolutely. now you know i'm looking for work?
9099,Lynette,"yeah, well, i'm just warming up. then bruno, the big bad turtle took harvey up on a cliff and threw him over, and he proclaimed,"" ""we'll see if you can fly, fly or die, fly or die!"
12971,Lynette,your job? the one you're magically gonna get by sulking and acting like a brat? you had a shot. you blew it.
10875,Lynette,okay.
11122,Lynette,"okay, okay, i know what you're thinking, but--kayla's going through a hard time right now. come and sit down. letting her watch tv is like me letting you eat ice cream when you're sick."
11659,Lynette,i said i'd have sex. i didn't say i'd make love.
11036,Lynette,take a nap.
11444,Lynette,"well, but he's been clean for almost a year."
12997,Lynette,you guess? gaby--
11672,Lynette,that's me. i'll be back.
11480,Lynette,"why? you know he'll just shoot it down. i mean, i get it. he's in pain. he doesn't like being sidelined, but that is no reason to--you know what?let's talk about something else."
9477,Lynette,"hey. look, i just wanted to apologise."
11117,Lynette,"oh, sorry, sweetheart. he's working late, trying to get the restaurant ready. oh, lovely, parker. go wash your hands. go on."
12616,Lynette,that's what you were afraid of?
10371,Lynette,"oh,i get it. i get it.ooh! this is your idea of driving the train.and it's very manly and really impressive,but it's really,really bad timing.you can't be serious.mmm. we're gonna--we're gonna be late."
10809,Lynette,"yeah, well, after all those fastballs--come on, parker! you can do it!"
11697,Lynette,"you said not to worry about money, that you'd find it somewhere."
10318,Lynette,"you put my kids in danger,and then you lied about it.do you not get how big that is?do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?"
12860,Lynette,this will just take a sec.
12203,Lynette,"oh, tom."
9886,Lynette,"um, i wasn't planning to, uh, but why?"
10656,Lynette,"fine, fine, no absolutely fine. put crazy' at the end and we'll crop her out later."
12738,Lynette,thank you so much. we are so sorry that we-
11237,Lynette,"oh, my pills! i need my pills, and now they're all dirty!"
10384,Lynette,"perfect! take your time.hey,honey.how's the big apple treating ya?good. did those,uh,snooty clients like your pitch?well,that's perfect.excellent."
10932,Lynette,"see?this is exactly what she wants.she takes kayla,and i get blamed.well,screw her.let's sue for custody."
11679,Lynette,"hey, i'm starting to get worried about bree. maybe we should call."
9053,Lynette,so your boss made you return her underwear?
11822,Lynette,this really is delicious.
11597,Lynette,yeah.
10666,Lynette,i told her that we were picking up kayla for a quiet afternoon at home.
12542,Lynette,drunk? jealous?
12566,Lynette,"what, do machine guns come out of the headlights?"
9575,Lynette,whatever.
10848,Lynette,excuse me?
10717,Lynette,"so, he was an actual suspect?"
11319,Lynette,yeah?
9137,Lynette,"no, no! i'm sorry! false alarm. we didn't find a body. uh, susan just had some really good news. sorry."
9809,Lynette,what?
10339,Lynette,"oh,good.parker,don't put your elbows on the table. come on."
9084,Lynette,okay. you boys. come here and give mamma a three-bear hug.
11803,Lynette,"that's sweet, and totally accurate. but i'm really whipped from the chemo, so--oh, there's my other line. can you ask me next time, okay, hon? okay, bye."
10232,Lynette,oh.
12262,Lynette,"you brought it up before, and in this case, i really don't think we have a choice."
10616,Lynette,"sweetie, sometimes when you're at work, and i'm home alone with three young boys, i'm not so happy, and now i'm gonna be alone with four kids. each one is a blessing, yes, but i don't think i can take any more-- blessings.more blessings could make me lose my mind.do you understand?"
10914,Lynette,i have been trying to stay away from you--
9062,Lynette,"well, look on the bright side, tom's having the time of his life."
11688,Lynette,should you even be playing tennis after your back surgery?
12341,Lynette,you have got to be kidding me!
12252,Lynette,boys? who are you talking about?
10069,Lynette,"oh, i was planning to."
12890,Lynette,we're sort of broke.
9677,Lynette,"well, that, that sounds great. thank you."
13145,Lynette,"i know, and i'm really sorry. listen, i gotta go. i will call you later. i love you. bye."
10047,Lynette,"well, she won't just take some time off for a couple of hours?"
9327,Lynette,"hey, guys. what's going on?"
10458,Lynette,good luck.
11001,Lynette,to the market.
9177,Lynette,we're here! woo! ten minutes early! sign me up?
12655,Lynette,don't you touch him! don't you touch him! go home now!
10830,Lynette,two bribery scandals. gotta count the batting helmets.
9850,Lynette,"well, i'm not. so, uh, what about that guy over there? he's been checking you out since we walked in."
12002,Lynette,i don't need your money. i can take care of my mother all by myself.
9738,Lynette,"well, you look amazing."
12144,Lynette,"the reason i ask is, there are wars all over the world, and it seems like every month, some dumb-ass walks into a school and starts shooting children. so i'm thinking, god's love? not so sure."
12190,Lynette,"gaby, people don't come here for the amenities. they come because toilet paper's 3 cents a ton."
8946,Lynette,"well, these things happen. oh, i'll be right back."
9665,Lynette,"uh, no. i can't. you're very, so--"
11871,Lynette,"i do, and i'm up for that."
9491,Lynette,"huh, well, i'm glad to hear you're alright."
10587,Lynette,would it be better if we came back at another time?
12636,Lynette,good. i'll see you downstairs.
10741,Lynette,"no, no, no, no!"
8696,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey, hey!"
12682,Lynette,"i have to ask you something, and it is very important that you tell me the truth."
9249,Lynette,"too late, you stole and then you lied. even worse? you made me look bad in front of mrs. mccluskey, who you know is mommy's sworn enemy. time to pick your poison. how 'bout a belt? it's a classic."
13008,Lynette,"nobody cares how old you are, tom."
11295,Lynette,"tom, i do not need to be pregnant to kick your ass. now go. go on."
10785,Lynette,what?
10732,Lynette,"no, seriously, gaby, i am so tired of pretending to smile."
10359,Lynette,what? why?
10565,Lynette,great. great.they're in the day care room.i'm-- looking at 'em right now.
11336,Lynette,please stop apologizing.
11908,Lynette,"look, this is not just about a tree house or a fountain. this is about what kind of neighborhood we want to live in. do we get to make our own choices, or do we let the taste police make them for us?"
9796,Lynette,"i agree with you to a point when they're flying kangaroos or giant robots, not surrogate mommies."
13121,Lynette,could you maybe step outside? i only do one show a day.
9683,Lynette,"don't do this to me. i don't have time to make a phone call, and i promised that woman i would not let the kids interfere with this job."
11449,Lynette,"oh, my god! you are a lifesaver!"
10046,Lynette,"well, maybe if i talked to her."
10775,Lynette,why would he be afraid?
10496,Lynette,you blocked?
10885,Lynette,fine.
10324,Lynette,"no,i'm pretty sure the lowell group used eskimos in a deodorant commercial they had last month. remember?"
11854,Lynette,what?
12381,Lynette,"good. good, then--get out there and get committed, you crazy kids."
12367,Lynette,"oh, tom. don't you know an urban myth when you hear one?"
11014,Lynette,"in the daytime, art coaches swimming at the rec center, but, please, i can tell parker? please?"
8869,Lynette,yeah. i thought that was understood.
12629,Lynette,"oh, please! you would never do that."
9529,Lynette,congratulations. you read me like a book. why would you hire that woman?
9537,Lynette,"yeah, i'll check my book. so annabel, do you have feelings for tom?"
12719,Lynette,"well, actually, i wanted to borrow edie's yellow sweater for the, uh, arraignment."
12621,Lynette,what are you talking about?
11034,Lynette,"i am snapping because there is a monster across the street, and barney fife here is making me sound like the bad guy!"
11737,Lynette,muriel.how are you doing?what's up?you look good.
11371,Lynette,"well, once he decides to stop hiding, i can ask him. you know what? i'm tired of waiting. i'm gonna go down there and i'm gonna talk to him. see you guys later."
12768,Lynette,what?
9591,Lynette,tom!
9700,Lynette,it won't be an ongoing thing.
9010,Lynette,"oh, yeah. sorry."
12995,Lynette,y-you don't know?
9920,Lynette,"ah, no, it's, it's okay. believe me, my boys can take care of themselves."
11459,Lynette,"and we charge twenty dollars! four people who would've shared a fifteen dollar pizza are now spending eighty bucks. okay, kids, dig in!"
11651,Lynette,"speaking of carlos, i hear he got evicted."
12492,Lynette,you mean his junk?
8930,Lynette,why not? fifty cents a bet?
12656,Lynette,stop it! go on! go on! go on!
12436,Lynette,his what on what?
11983,Lynette,nobody is manipulating you.
10930,Lynette,she's tom's daughter. you can't just take her out of the country.
12309,Lynette,i can't believe she was blackmailing you.
8870,Lynette,"yes, but by the time they realise their mistake we'll be in."
10001,Lynette,"yeah, no, i didn't think so. ante up."
11637,Lynette,"yeah, and then you threw up in the trophy."
11256,Lynette,here's my application.
9431,Lynette,i'm sorry but i can't understand you. you're gonna have to talk slower.
12247,Lynette,"well, gee, i'm kind of at a loss here, tom. dr. spock didn't have a chapter on how to punish your kids for burning down a building."
12137,Lynette,"great! just give me a second to sell tom on the idea. you know, he was raised catholic."
11393,Lynette,that is a great idea!
12488,Lynette,you bought tom a new bass?
12804,Lynette,how about we pick something from your cookbook?
10841,Lynette,"whatever you wanna do,i'm in your corner."
12901,Lynette,i know.
9961,Lynette,"you do that. okay, guys, come on over here. on the sidewalk. stay there. not on the street. thank you."
12207,Lynette,"hi, andrew. guess what? your mom just won the founder's award."
12549,Lynette,penny!
13080,Lynette,"hey, travers. remember us?"
9952,Lynette,not a one.
11277,Lynette,what is--
10320,Lynette,"you put my kids in danger,and then you lied about it.do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?"
8834,Lynette,are you sure? he's gonna freak.
12279,Lynette,you're burying your head in the sand.
12560,Lynette,"so i'm thinking no more electrical work, okay?"
9868,Lynette,hi.
12930,Lynette,"not a dent. a fist print. my husband's been a little frustrated lately. on the plus side, it matches the shoe print on the dishwasher."
12083,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
13028,Lynette,gaby!
13206,Lynette,"honey, i'm glad you're home. i brought someone home from work i want you to meet."
11915,Lynette,"see, that's awkward for me. this is about personal freedom. you know? i'm running as a libertarian."
10855,Lynette,"i know, but i said that i would support him and help him follow his dream."
10298,Lynette,"well,thank you so much!"
12849,Lynette,"actually, i have to go to work. but congratulations, bree. it's a beauty."
10913,Lynette,i'm sorry. i didn't quite catch that. why don't you just come on over here and say that to me again?
11945,Lynette,"honey, i put up a fence, and he burrowed right under it. the man at the garden center said these are crafty creatures, and there's only one way to stop 'em."
12265,Lynette,well--yeah. think of what that poor girl has been through. and on top of that--her mom was kind of a psycho.
11644,Lynette,"okay, okay. give it up, tom."
8706,Lynette,"oh, please, the man's gotten me pregnant three times in four years. i wish he was having sex with someone else."
13022,Lynette,"oh, that is so thoughtful of you. you're such a good friend."
9314,Lynette,sure.
11159,Lynette,yeah?
9015,Lynette,"look, i'm on my last nerves, so i'm going to level with you. i've screwed up my entire system by taking my system by taking my kids'add medication. yeah, that's right, you heard me. i plan to stop, but right now i need to sleep, and i need more than a few, crappy, needles, so whattya got?"
11258,Lynette,"i had so much fun at the fair today, working with you on something that was all ours. i want every day to be like that."
13230,Lynette,"hey, hey, how was the campus tour?"
10607,Lynette,no way.
9385,Lynette,that was not a smart thing to say.
12585,Lynette,"well, it's just--i saw you two together, and i--i didn't know that you were-- and she looks so--for god sakes, tom, the woman has to be somewhere. just sign the damn lease."
11158,Lynette,"might there be a v.i.p. preview for people, say, who bore your children?"
8757,Lynette,"listen, i was just getting dinner ready."
11073,Lynette,you can defend him all you want. i know what i know.
12284,Lynette,"oh, we gotta take him to the hospital."
12325,Lynette,are you-- threatening me?
12659,Lynette,"aah! porter, i told you to go home. what are you doing here?"
10896,Lynette,we're numbing the pain of our miserable lives.
11996,Lynette,why can't you take her? you are in that huge house all by yourself that you got from the divorce.
11770,Lynette,by taking all the fun of the kill?
11162,Lynette,"what? i am snarky because i point out one small, glaring mistake?"
9917,Lynette,"hey, hey, hey, porter, preston, knock it off. all right, did you hear me, i said stop it. stand up. stand up! come here!"
11291,Lynette,"hey, chill out. you're acting like i did when i was six months pregnant."
9057,Lynette,"oh, yes."
10142,Lynette,that doesn't mean betty knew him.
11247,Lynette,"load me up again, would ya?"
10580,Lynette,"then--then you go in for an ultrasound, and you hear two heartbeats. then and only then does your husband tell you that twins run in his family."
12013,Lynette,"oh, my god. it's the police?"
8848,Lynette,"paul, i'm so sorry."
9556,Lynette,show?
12830,Lynette,i got the job.
11334,Lynette,wow.
11923,Lynette,"you can keep that satellite dish. in fact, this is practically a first amendment issue. the way i see it--"
10740,Lynette,thanks.
12208,Lynette,what? what? is everyone okay?
13141,Lynette,"hey, honey. how's your day going?"
12086,Lynette,"okay. you really, really, really think so?"
13220,Lynette,you know what would be more educational? you going to college like we talked about.
11466,Lynette,"we've been open for three months now, and we've barely turned a profit!"
8817,Lynette,"well, there was dinner, but it wasn't much of a party."
9888,Lynette,another suit. i have other suits.
11610,Lynette,you okay? you've been so quiet all night.
8934,Lynette,my boys are the oak trees.
12764,Lynette,"oh, hello, mr. fishman."
11948,Lynette,bree.
10819,Lynette,"well, excuse me for not wanting my son to be a quitter."
12977,Lynette,"yes. tom was very good at his job, right up until he got fired."
9440,Lynette,"no, because your husband was being a total jerk!"
10005,Lynette,and nina!
10859,Lynette,"care to elaborate, dr. mccluskey?"
11499,Lynette,"oh, great. now we know she's watching us."
10374,Lynette,"yeah, it sucks, but there are other perks--the expense account, the corner office--"
9986,Lynette,it's just stu from our office.
9900,Lynette,"oh, no. come on, tom. not this one."
10529,Lynette,we're a team.i'm just lending support.
11436,Lynette,"oh, my god, rick. i never got back to you. i am so sorry."
10829,Lynette,i'll get my checkbook.
11481,Lynette,"i mean, unless you'd like to go. you're here so late all the time."
11588,Lynette,we're doing inventory.
12886,Lynette,"you know that was an accident, right?"
13190,Lynette,back up a second. you guys were classmates?
11751,Lynette,"aw,my hero. i can handle her."
9011,Lynette,"parker! i don't know --ow!--what you think that you're doing, but put that back where it belongs!"
8812,Lynette,"when tom and i were first married, things got a little out of hand on mr. toad's wild ride."
9308,Lynette,i thought this was an in-house position.
11310,Lynette,did you get some sleep?
9647,Lynette,"you know, i didn't tell you to quit."
12606,Lynette,okay.
12708,Lynette,that's high. where are we gonna get that kind of money?
10260,Lynette,here you go.
12080,Lynette,"come on! hurry up! go! get in, get in! get in! uhh! hang on! hang onto this!"
11544,Lynette,down! down! down! aah!
11213,Lynette,mrs. mccluskey. won't that be fun?
8741,Lynette,to mary alice.
12834,Lynette,could you hold on a second?
12902,Lynette,i don't know that's why we all have to be really supportive. are you with me?
10524,Lynette,i can't believe that son of a bitch hired a forensic accountant.he's more whipped than i thought.
9161,Lynette,"yeah, okay. that's what i like to hear."
9482,Lynette,then why don't you think about moving somewhere less expensive? like a nursing home?
11374,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, tom. tommy--okay, okay, you're breathing. that's good. that's good."
8783,Lynette,hey.
11230,Lynette,everything.
9376,Lynette,yes.
9978,Lynette,"give me a break. you know our kids. i love them dearly, but that goes in one ear and out the other."
9345,Lynette,"guys, we should be ashamed of ourselves for reveling in that woman's misery. that being said, edie, please continue."
12005,Lynette,"hey, glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest of my life. you drove him away."
9739,Lynette,"absolutely. well, i can't imagine what you're going through."
11095,Lynette,"well, that's my home, and i don't feel very safe right now. please, please, all of you, just leave this street. please, i beg of you. go! just get off my street, please!"
11670,Lynette,nothing happened. he's gone. it's over.
12661,Lynette,i saw a grown man beating up on my teenage boy. what else do you want to know?
12034,Lynette,kinda.
10395,Lynette,the people in this office feel a little--concerned--that you're nursing a boy of donovan's age.
10851,Lynette,hmm.
9711,Lynette,wow. it's really pilin' up.
10655,Lynette,"nora, this is just for our family.i would prefer if you weren't in it."
13046,Lynette,"hey, i got you sodas, didn't i? and i let you feed the paper shredder."
12608,Lynette,you sure?
9513,Lynette,okay. okay.
11714,Lynette,how did you-
12754,Lynette,"like i said, it's in my dna that could be him. get out. get out! get out!"
10931,Lynette,it's fine with me--soon as you figure out a way to leave your genitals here.
12131,Lynette,we should go to church.
11353,Lynette,"hey, guys."
10067,Lynette,you took the baby without telling fran?
11453,Lynette,so--good news! our chef is preparing his special spaghetti carbonara.
11475,Lynette,"hey, they didn't have jell-o, so i hope pudding is okay."
12019,Lynette,"yes, yes, thank you, but where has she been staying?"
10531,Lynette,here are the numbers you wanted.
10718,Lynette,the point is alma disappeared under very suspicious circumstances.
11361,Lynette,"you keep ordering me around and disagreeing with me and overuling me, and i'm sick of it. we have to do things my way at least every once in a while."
12466,Lynette,"hey, tom?"
10164,Lynette,"so that if you're the last man to survive a nuclear holocaust,you could repopulate the planet?"
12785,Lynette,"porter, listen to me. bob talked to the judge. he thinks he can get them to drop the charges."
12916,Lynette,"okay, you fill water glasses. i'll make the salads."
13290,Lynette,oh really? more steak?
13129,Lynette,tom?
11667,Lynette,"well, i feel just fine now."
12530,Lynette,stu? stu is doing bree's ad campaign? i rode in his hatchback once. it smelled like mu shu. i gotta warn her.
11784,Lynette,"well--i felt a little weird about something that happened at lunch, and i thought we should talk about it."
12940,Lynette,i think we have the kind of friendship where you don't have to say anything. let's just hug and move on. okay?
8847,Lynette,troubled?
12287,Lynette,did you have anything to do with the fire at rick's restaurant?
12626,Lynette,"gee, porter. that's just one of the pitfalls of dating a married woman."
8819,Lynette,why not?
12946,Lynette,could you call him now?
10100,Lynette,guess what? ed loved the pitch.i got off early!
9315,Lynette,really?
10507,Lynette,what kind of terms?
11947,Lynette,"okay, we're done talking here."
11210,Lynette,"oh, i'm sure it will be."
10575,Lynette,"he's not coming, sweetheart.but you could show me."
10959,Lynette,i did not want this. don't you dare say that i wanted this.
10984,Lynette,"i'm good. i just, how do i thank the man who saved my life?"
8945,Lynette,"uh-huh. ah, incidentally, who is 'they', as in 'they forgot to tell the printer'?"
13069,Lynette,"no, thanks."
11026,Lynette,"you don't get it. his house had this creepy vibe. tell him, tom."
11002,Lynette,"hey, sweetie, it's a different market."
11575,Lynette,"i just talked to mrs.mccluskey, and she is gonna start looking after our kids again."
13049,Lynette,i don't know. i'm just as worried as you are.
10223,Lynette,what does that mean?
12079,Lynette,"oh! hurry!oh! go! no! come on! come on! come on, come on! get in!"
12701,Lynette,then this is really not an alibi. it's more a confession to another crime.
11045,Lynette,"great, great."
13019,Lynette,gaby didn't mention that.
9449,Lynette,"you just signed 'i told you so', didn't you?"
9086,Lynette,okay.
11892,Lynette,"well, that's a good rule. although it wasn't bad news. it was actually--"
10669,Lynette,thank you.
11120,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry. those are the rules."
10176,Lynette,"oh,i know! i know!but it is what married people do.they go out of their way to calm each other's irrational fears.oh,come on,tom.i really need you to do this."
9305,Lynette,"no. no, you didn't."
9547,Lynette,i thought you said you didn't have any female friends?
11884,Lynette,"oh--my god. i haven't, have i? i am one of those--whiny, self-involved sick people."
9417,Lynette,sorry. i should have mentioned that my tennis is much better than my cooking.
9332,Lynette,hey. see you later.
12352,Lynette,"i--okay. look, look, i-i will come with you. please, just don't handcuff me in front of my children."
12148,Lynette,"yeah, and i'm breaking her in tonight. nothing like that new bible smell."
13261,Lynette,"i'm so proud. porter, aren't you gonna congratulate your father?"
11616,Lynette,"yes, flirting! that's it! it's what married people do, because we know there is a line you don't cross. and maybe i've gotten close to that line, and maybe i've enjoyed getting close to that line, but i have never once crossed it."
9410,Lynette,"how can i ignore this? and i quote, 'it's not like she can hear.'"
11324,Lynette,"oh, thank you.thank you, thank you."
9092,Lynette,"so if you're not sure he's back for good, why are you ironing his shirts?"
13166,Lynette,oh. was it good?
10982,Lynette,"uh, yeah."
11406,Lynette,"well, i should probably take a look at your application first. okay, don't be afraid if you don't have a ton of experience. i realize for what we're paying, we're not exactly gonna get a--you were a sous-chef at cucina? that's a five-star restaurant."
11864,Lynette,"gaby, i'm not a redhead."
9583,Lynette,"oh. oh, it's probably baby drool."
12394,Lynette,"oh, let's make it a party. we could do it at my restaurant."
12914,Lynette,"sweetie, i need two dinner salads. what's the matter?"
12160,Lynette,bree--
10878,Lynette,it's a burner-downer.
9943,Lynette,no!
9164,Lynette,edie!
10678,Lynette,"okay, kids.come on, come on!"
10027,Lynette,"stu, you're a gopher. you can't consent to anything. so, i think you should talk to ed about getting your job back."
9656,Lynette,we should-- talk about this.
9216,Lynette,"well, for starters, you can wipe that disgusting smirk off your face."
8955,Lynette,really?
10942,Lynette,even you have to admit kayla would be better off with us than in a dingy apartment over a tijuana strip club.
12780,Lynette,"porter wasn't there, and she won't tell me where he is."
10715,Lynette,"get a grip? i am hanging on for dear life, here. you are the one that brought this little problem into our family and the only thing i should be hearing from you is 'how can i help?' i am also putting steve hansen at her table so you might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy."
10906,Lynette,"go, ida!"
12887,Lynette,a check for the damage to your car. i can't afford to go through my insurance company.
8703,Lynette,hey.
9113,Lynette,they're full of iron. could you make sure they clean their plates?
10191,Lynette,we've got-- nothing.
11959,Lynette,"no way. he's here, tom. i can tell."
8798,Lynette,yeah.
10487,Lynette,"okay.thanks.well,i'm gonna go back in my office and continue to feel like a huge pervert."
9481,Lynette,"you want to talk about good neighbour etiquette, how about you hire a gardener to take care of that jungle you call a lawn."
10546,Lynette,we're aware of that.
9029,Lynette,"then i started taking the pills because they gave me energy, but then i couldn't sleep at night, and i was getting so tired in the daytime. and, it totally messed me up. i love my kids so much. i'm so sorry they have me as a mother."
11106,Lynette,"well, nicer than that, or she's gonna get all your toys, too."
11749,Lynette,"oh,sorry."
9472,Lynette,what are you doing? don't. you. dare.
12355,Lynette,how can you talk like that? what else has to happen for you to get what's going on here?
8735,Lynette,yeah.
10927,Lynette,"whoa, what fresh hell is this?"
9596,Lynette,"she's the fantasy, tom, the hot woman that you work with everyday. with her manicured nails and designer outfits. i am the reality. the wife who never wears make-up and whose clothes smell like a hamper."
11469,Lynette,"yeah? well, then why don't you come down to the restaurant and stop me? oh, that's right. you can't."
10292,Lynette,thank you.thank you so much.
13155,Lynette,so--carlos--where were we?
9606,Lynette,"you know, i kinda like it."
9396,Lynette,so what did mike say when he gave you the letter?
10301,Lynette,"okay,all right,that lie just lost you another week of tv and video game privileges.that's two.you wanna keep talking and lose more?then apologize to mrs. van de kamp."
12816,Lynette,"i had it in the back of my mind for a while, and then yesterday, i got a ph--"
11984,Lynette,what have you got there? are you reading from something?
11188,Lynette,i bet you were quite the player.
9134,Lynette,you don't say.
9731,Lynette,"no, you come on! just get up! get up!"
10111,Lynette,"maybe.yes.but gaby doesn't think she did anything wrong.that's not right,either."
10360,Lynette,i'm sorry.i'm not following.
9708,Lynette,"oh, my god. i mean, i knew mary alice had killed herself over something big, but wow. can you imagine living with that guilt?"
12419,Lynette,"no! you don't want two cool kids pulling up to homecoming in a mom car, especially with that big dent they put in it last month."
12637,Lynette,you're having sex with your best friend's mother?
8705,Lynette,even the limp ones aren't that ethical.
12477,Lynette,could you just--for a sec? come on. you know i'm right. you're far too busy for this.
9294,Lynette,hey! don't look so glum. you're gonna get a hit.
10397,Lynette,"come on,baby birds don't jump out of the nest.they need to be pushed."
9419,Lynette,what's your problem?
11075,Lynette,"i have kids, okay? better safe than sorry."
9499,Lynette,"no i can't. i'm sorry, but i have a lot of things to do."
9545,Lynette,fantastic shape. she's gorgeous.
13082,Lynette,unless that's a little weird for you.
12533,Lynette,coupons.
12397,Lynette,sorry.
9863,Lynette,"oh, is she now?"
10405,Lynette,huh?
10844,Lynette,what are we celebrating?
12876,Lynette,we use that parmesan all the time. you can't go changing things without asking me.
9652,Lynette,huh?
10820,Lynette,whoa. where'd that come from?
10602,Lynette,you have no idea how badly you scared me.
8858,Lynette,"here, you."
10391,Lynette,"okay. but for the record,the team is made up of wimps."
8944,Lynette,"jordana, maisy, here are the costumes, right on time."
12770,Lynette,"tom, i know where porter is. he's hiding at my mother's."
9780,Lynette,"oh, honey, i'm here. i'm here. you can show me your cubby now."
9319,Lynette,okay.
9916,Lynette,"guys, stop it! stop it, i mean it, come on!"
12634,Lynette,"hey, breakfast's on the table. porter, this whole hating me thing that you've got going on right now--believe it or not, i get where you're coming from."
8996,Lynette,"no, they don't."
8739,Lynette,"he got smoke inhalation, he's at the hospital."
10860,Lynette,"oh, great. so, uh, tom will drop her off at your house on friday."
12676,Lynette,"i'm helping you help me. this way, you get to start a new life, and i get to not have you around while my son is going through all this."
10716,Lynette,get a grip.
9715,Lynette,"see, that's what i would call a flaw in the system."
11646,Lynette,"no, no."
9239,Lynette,glad to get that off my chest. thank you.
10099,Lynette,does gaby know that you know?
8700,Lynette,"i know someone, who knows someone, who knows an elf. and if anyone of you acts up, so help me, i will call santa and tell him you want socks for christmas. you willing to risk that?"
11390,Lynette,no.
10542,Lynette,"i love you,too."
13242,Lynette,"well, it's just so random, and the worst part is if i point that out, i'm a bitch."
12931,Lynette,fine. congratulations. you just stole a pizza oven.
13298,Lynette,"i just told them to paint something nice, the sentiment is all theirs."
9515,Lynette,"you're a piece of work, you know that? well, this is crazy, why'd they give you childproof caps?"
12315,Lynette,oh. yow! it's a little pricey.
10704,Lynette,"what? no! no, no, no. what happened?"
11467,Lynette,why are you being so stubborn?and you would rather see the restaurant fail than succeed with rick's idea!
9600,Lynette,hey.
9142,Lynette,"nothing. i'm just saying you prefer women that are really curvy, like that sales girl or claire."
10310,Lynette,"okay,well,thanks."
9404,Lynette,"well, lynette loves talking about lynette, too."
11769,Lynette,"oh, my god. are you letting me win?"
10160,Lynette,"oh,it's just chicken pox.but brave heart here will only come in to sleep and shower."
12014,Lynette,glen? i don't believe it.
11040,Lynette,bye.
9990,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
10563,Lynette,"hey! great.great. how's atlantic city?are you, um, winning some money?"
12559,Lynette,hey.
9004,Lynette,"slow down, you jerk, this is a residential neighborhood."
11912,Lynette,but what?
12638,Lynette,i do. why do i have a sense you're gonna take it away from me?
10682,Lynette,i thought i told you tom took the kids to the movies.
9349,Lynette,the stakes were raised.
13256,Lynette,"hey. don't sweat it. you wanted to learn chinese--mm, we'll get you a book."
12600,Lynette,"oh, my god."
12220,Lynette,okay.
10492,Lynette,"okay!uh, well,i hope that helped.and i'm just gonna go back and finish so we can all get out of here."
11354,Lynette,"no. no, don't be silly. who am i, tom? i'm one of you guys. sit down. hey--you know what we could use? a good old-fashioned bi*ch session, get some stuff off our chests. so what's bugging you guys? okay, i'll go first. how do we feel about these uniforms? a little--eh?"
9133,Lynette,"so, claire, when did this incident occur?"
11473,Lynette,yeah?
12694,Lynette,"yes, sweetie, we are."
12796,Lynette,"speaking of cashing in your chips, anyone know when eli's funeral is?"
11197,Lynette,glad you thought so.
12403,Lynette,"yeah? ""creative"" like selling fake i.d.s was creative. and hot-wiring mccluskey's car-- that was a work of art."
9138,Lynette,uh-huh. a little formal for the mall.
11546,Lynette,i was wrong. i was wrong. come on. follow me. follow me.
10504,Lynette,i didn't!i didn't.why would she--oh!the honeymoon thing.
11397,Lynette,"arnie, thanks for coming in. we will definitely keep you in mind."
11456,Lynette,two. twenty-two. two.
10053,Lynette,okay. okay. i just thought i'd give it a shot.
8882,Lynette,that's wonderful.
9501,Lynette,"oh, for god's sake."
9178,Lynette,"no! no! i, i planned ahead."
9330,Lynette,"i, um, excuse me."
13110,Lynette,then maybe i'd get that raise i've been asking for.
12907,Lynette,but having the kids work there?
12195,Lynette,what?
9692,Lynette,thanks so much for having me in.
8920,Lynette,yeah.
9551,Lynette,"they never get to see you, let them stay up for a while."
8890,Lynette,look at that concentration. porter loves his puzzles.
11738,Lynette,yeah. things have been a little weird lately--
11701,Lynette,"tom, you don't know half the stuff she did to us. she would get drunk and smack us around. she would meet some new guy and then drop us off at her sister's for a week because he wasn't into kids."
9854,Lynette,why don't you buy her a drink?
9851,Lynette,"so, go over there."
12072,Lynette,of course.
10263,Lynette,"no. no, you're not gonna make him pay.you are gonna stop this now."
11730,Lynette,"no! no,i'm looking at the nightstand,and all i see are a few stray hairs and this sports blooper dvd you thought would cheer me up."
12812,Lynette,"i know, but mommy's still planning eli's memorial. start without me. i'll be there in a little while."
11494,Lynette,"i don't know how she does it. hey, it's getting late. let's break out the champagne."
12184,Lynette,"so where were you? you were stewing, weren't you? come on. you're upset about rick."
12282,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god! what happened? is he okay?"
9124,Lynette,tom--
12095,Lynette,no.
13274,Lynette,what am i gonna do about my job?
10471,Lynette,because it's not an appropriate subject.
10305,Lynette,yeah.it was cleared up.it was just a little confusion.
11447,Lynette,"please, please, tell me we can still make pizza."
9179,Lynette,"we're, we're ten minutes early."
11673,Lynette,is it a concussion?
9212,Lynette,thank you.
10762,Lynette,nah.
9982,Lynette,"yeah, i applaud that, but what i need is for you to help me to prove a point to my husband."
9510,Lynette,"hello? it's lynette? hello? mrs mcclusky? mrs mcclusky, are you alright?"
12884,Lynette,home. tell me how the party i threw for you turns out.
11943,Lynette,you know that possum that's been ruining our garden?
13037,Lynette,"but she makes people crazy. can't you talk to her, get her to dial it down a bit?"
12871,Lynette,"oh, for pete sake. i'll be right back."
11907,Lynette,i'm sorry. i didn't catch that.
11969,Lynette,hey.
11647,Lynette,"cram it! okay, yeah, tom, i've been unhappy lately. i am working through some issues, but that is something i need to do on my own. talking about it doesn't help--not to you, and certainly not to dr. beer pong."
10247,Lynette,i can't protect you.you're gonna have to find a way to click with ed yourself.
9520,Lynette,i'll see you tomorrow morning.
12964,Lynette,"oh. actually, i have 12 years of experience."
12880,Lynette,"i've worked my ass off, too. i just wasn't as lucky as you."
12781,Lynette,of course i did.
11178,Lynette,"well,then why isn't he dealing with it instead of shopping for napkins?we could lose our shirts in this dump!"
10735,Lynette,"no, no.what's unfair is that we're slowly running out of money and you've barely even looked for a job. you're going to have a good time, all right? i love you. bye."
10808,Lynette,yeah. ever seen one of these?
8981,Lynette,i knew this play date was a good idea.
11972,Lynette,"no, it was a big deal. you have taken amazing care of me. but i know you have so many things you wanna get back to."
9718,Lynette,"please, don't take this the wrong way. i think you are doing a terrific job, but let's be clear. when you came home, it was to clutter. i mean, come on, this is more than that."
12908,Lynette,really? that doesn't sound like me.
9531,Lynette,do you still have feelings for her?
9987,Lynette,maybe.
11900,Lynette,i mean-- you're not gonna start checking everyone's yards for things that don't fit in?
11316,Lynette,"i think what my husband is trying to say is, if you really want to test a marriage, open a restaurant together. anyway, thank you for coming. eat a lot and come back, 'cause our kids need braces."
13193,Lynette,"okay, i went a little overboard. you know me-- two margaritas, and i need a muzzle."
13175,Lynette,that is so sweet.
12361,Lynette,"bree, you can talk katherine up all you want, but she is just never gonna be one of us."
10041,Lynette,"yeah, like you haven't been through enough."
11399,Lynette,"well, that's what we pay you, and you seem happy enough."
12950,Lynette,"that's how i got rid of tom's last bottle of ""musk, the cologne for men."""
10747,Lynette,"please, tom, please!don't do this to me!"
11694,Lynette,i'll manage. you got through breast cancer while raising the three of us alone.
11510,Lynette,i will. i love you. bye.
12909,Lynette,okay. fine.
12929,Lynette,"what? it's a $12,000 oven."
10979,Lynette,okay?
9181,Lynette,"uh, it kind of snuck up on us."
8883,Lynette,boys? wake up.
10385,Lynette,"uh-huh.um,i'm--i'm,um-- i'm gonna have--i'm gonna call you back."
11069,Lynette,"well, believe me, rita, he scares me, too. you know what? we should have a meeting, get all the moms together and figure out what to do about this guy. saturday, your house. sounds good."
11194,Lynette,"this place is his dream, and if he can't make it work, then it's just gonna kill him, and consequently it's gonna kill our marriage."
12481,Lynette,you could break your dad's guitar and--
10922,Lynette,i had the mary alice dream again last night.
11268,Lynette,austin!
11229,Lynette,"no, it's too close."
12631,Lynette,i don't know.
8824,Lynette,maybe.
12365,Lynette,"'cause you know we didn't have a choice, tom. we had to get her out of the house."
8922,Lynette,"all right. i think everyone is down for a nap. we've got no more than an hour. let's get cracking. five car draw, nothing wild."
10452,Lynette,daddy will be home from his business trip in a few days.why don't you wait for him?
10023,Lynette,"see, i don't think that's why you got fired."
9093,Lynette,that's good. it's good to have faith in people.
10150,Lynette,not to us.
12978,Lynette,"well, we've all had our troubles as bosses, haven't we, tom? i was sort of sugarcoating it when i said his restaurant was very successful. the truth is, he mismanaged that pizza joint right into the ground."
10726,Lynette,uh oh.
8814,Lynette,how was your night?
11537,Lynette,"hey, guys, go check out the snakes. i'll give you some pizza later, okay?"
11683,Lynette,"hey, you wanna hold it down up there, kids? i'm trying to talk to your aunt lucy! thank you!"
11052,Lynette,hello? open up! open the door!
9213,Lynette,"well, um, we don't want to be late for the game. nice to meet you!"
12897,Lynette,"i did, for seven years. now i'm gonna be a realist, and i need you to be one, too."
10770,Lynette,excuse me? did you smoke that bong before you beat the guy with it?
8747,Lynette,let's say we do. there's a chance we're not gonna like what we find.
9879,Lynette,happily married.
11111,Lynette,"and what did you get for her, porter?"
9966,Lynette,"and for good reason. someone could have driven off with them, and you wouldn't have even noticed."
9291,Lynette,"well, did you tell mr. peterson that you wanted the job?"
11269,Lynette,get your stuff. get the hell out of my restaurant. you're fired. go on.
13286,Lynette,really--
10303,Lynette,i'm sorry. i'm so sorry.
9359,Lynette,"edie, if you want me to share stuff with you, you're gonna have to start being more supportive of susan."
12375,Lynette,i'll get lee.
12371,Lynette,uh--there are no wings.
9025,Lynette,"boys, would you please, please, stop it. really, really, mommy's got a headache. okay? just, uh--"
12001,Lynette,it's like you're saying you don't care about her. at all? and i don't understand that.
13076,Lynette,less yakkin' more draggin'.
9607,Lynette,no.
13237,Lynette,so--you would be a college student-- again.
12300,Lynette,oh. well--s-sure. i've been very good to her.
8825,Lynette,"aww. you know, it's gonna take more than just this one night."
13078,Lynette,isn't that what she did for the last 15 years?
12921,Lynette,"so? take another one. what's the difference? well, since i'm the only one here who c wait on that table without knocking over a glass with my pants, how about i take it? you handle the cash register. you bus tables. go on."
13289,Lynette,right.
10326,Lynette,hey.
12570,Lynette,"well, i might not say anything. i might just put my finger to my ear and twirl it in small circles. we can't do something like that, tom."
12487,Lynette,yeah. sure. come on in.
9525,Lynette,"well, i'll let you get back to work. i'll see you later."
8784,Lynette,yeah.
11509,Lynette,"oh, tom--i'm sorry. i can't come home. we're, um--doing inventory, so--it could be a while."
8760,Lynette,"i try everything. i scream, i threaten, i reason, i beg, nothing works. i don't know if it's because they're too young and they don't understand, or if they're just getting some perverse joy out of testing me!"
12349,Lynette,what? why? wh--for what?
13291,Lynette,"please christy, there is no way that i can get another babysitter this late in the day."
11166,Lynette,"oh. yeah, that's right."
11833,Lynette,"yeah, no, i'm good. hey, do you think they have any grapes or lobster?"
12234,Lynette,"well, it wouldn't be the first time. you lied about the brick, and you were pretty smooth, too. hell, i bought it."
13004,Lynette,"okay, i'm gonna stop you. what is this obsession with age? i am a vital woman with passion and a library of knowledge when it comes to this industry. why doesn't that count for something?"
10557,Lynette,sorry. stop. done talking.that's fantastic.i love you!
10008,Lynette,my demands are simple. i want you to be nicer.
10065,Lynette,"you're doing the right thing, ed, for little mindy."
13108,Lynette,i don't. carlos does.
13099,Lynette,"don't make plans on tuesday. we're having dinner at the solis' and--what's that look on your face? you didn't eat dairy again, did you?"
12748,Lynette,"what? what?! that's why he ran away? i thought he was afraid of going to jail. well, i'm sure warren schilling was just trying to scare him."
11129,Lynette,nothing.
9278,Lynette,um--
12125,Lynette,yep. third strike? what were the first two?
13033,Lynette,big deal. so is this coffee mug.
11339,Lynette,"oh, don't you dare."
9490,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, you're back from the hospital already?"
12192,Lynette,"no, i'm pretty sure the blind qualify, too."
10657,Lynette,ten seconds.
9615,Lynette,"oh, yeah. i wanted to do something nice for duggan."
9847,Lynette,it's a gimlet. you'll love it.
8727,Lynette,"hey, yeah!"
11184,Lynette,"please, i've been at this for hours. just hear me out."
11068,Lynette,our neighbor is a pedophile.
10714,Lynette,"oh, it's once a year. suck it up."
10240,Lynette,"on one condition.if you take this job,you are never allowed to bring up what happened before with your promotion."
11671,Lynette,don't do this.
13081,Lynette,"come here. i'm afraid we have some bad news. your mom was in a very serious accident, and i am so sorry--but she passed away."
11867,Lynette,"lynette's not here right now. i'm brandy, the slutty cheerleader."
11816,Lynette,"well, thanks, but prefer not to get my medication from some guy under a bridge."
9208,Lynette,hi.
12511,Lynette,no?
9947,Lynette,"you know, what we're saying is, we get it. you're just having fun. it's nothing to be ashamed of."
10133,Lynette,"well, sure, no problem."
11231,Lynette,"cereal? i didn't have any--oh, i know what that is. i get nauseous from the pain, so that's just a little residual vomit."
10060,Lynette,bye-bye.
12405,Lynette,you think they're cool.
12334,Lynette,"uh, one second. preston, you might wanna stop dropping your waffle on the floor, cause i'm still gonna make you eat it. so, uh, what's c.p.s.?"
11929,Lynette,what? you think you can just walk over here and cute your way out of what you did? we're supposed to be friends.
10132,Lynette,"oh, hey, carlos.hi."
11527,Lynette,"oh! the boys would love that, but unfortunately, i gotta work."
9460,Lynette,"tom and i don't believe in hitting our kids, i thought you knew that."
11764,Lynette,"it's a little uncomfortable, but i'm fine. take a card."
11808,Lynette,didn't you tell me you lost your virginity in the backseat of a--
10206,Lynette,really? what's his name?
9147,Lynette,"we are not going anywhere until you confess you have the hots for our nanny. tom, it's okay. she's attractive. men by nature are drawn to fertile young women with whom them can plant their seed."
11054,Lynette,"he's not at our house, he's not in our yard. do not jerk me around."
11957,Lynette,"yeah. now he's playing mind games with me, but i laid out some halloween candy. pretty soon he'll get hungry, and when he does--trick or treat."
11774,Lynette,just go. i'll cab it.
12954,Lynette,"okay. i was going to wait to tell you this when you were in a good mood, but i realize that's not gonna happen, so bree has a special guest tonight, her publisher--and as luck would have it, he's looking to hire a new marketing executive."
13030,Lynette,"oh, you found out about that?"
10945,Lynette,tell him i said to share. now put daddy on.
12856,Lynette,although--how would you like to own a piece of an italian restaurant?
12092,Lynette,"hahaha, so her niece and nephew are taking all this stuff back to nebraska?"
10528,Lynette,"what,what?"
8923,Lynette,might i suggest the barcliffe academy production of little red riding hood?
10485,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
9368,Lynette,they didn't?
9372,Lynette,"no, i don't. you're going to have to give me a name."
11635,Lynette,yeah?
10172,Lynette,do you have any idea how painful it is to hear about you even think about your next wife and kids?i could never do that!i can't imagine my life without you.you are my everything!
12128,Lynette,"katherine, we didn't come here to upset you."
12810,Lynette,"hey, sweetie. what's up?"
12459,Lynette,uh-- thanks.
10947,Lynette,a big one with laser beam eyes. now go get daddy!
8878,Lynette,"sorry, tom, mr lenz was trying to say something. mr lenz?"
8835,Lynette,malignant?
12201,Lynette,"no, overreacting would be if i threw a brick through you. what were you thinking? help me understand."
10696,Lynette,ah.
13065,Lynette,been here before?
9123,Lynette,did you set up the coffee maker?
9989,Lynette,well-
11151,Lynette,mmm.
9909,Lynette,"just hear me out. i was gonna take it back, i swear."
13045,Lynette,"well, i'll admit it's kind of flimsy, but until i got something better--"
11693,Lynette,"listen, mom, i really appreciate you coming to help, but as you can see, i'm perfectly fine."
11398,Lynette,he kept asking what we do with the food people don't eat.
11589,Lynette,so this little ear-shaped pasta is called--
9303,Lynette,you called your boss a fool?
10640,Lynette,"well, to be honest, first, we bought you pie, then you tried to extort money from us."
10437,Lynette,formula.
10794,Lynette,"well, it's called parenting, tom.watch and learn.okay, p-dog, this is a curveball. again, opening the eyes--can't stress it enough."
12604,Lynette,so you'll come home?
9173,Lynette,"and i'm also cranky. you know how you get when you haven't taken a nap? well, mommies are the same way. we need our down time, and if we don't get it -"
13302,Lynette,"oh, yeah.i'll bite you good."
11138,Lynette,"mm-hmm. okay. boys, go to the car. i'll be out in a minute. go. listen, sweetheart, i don't blame you for being angry. your mom's gone,and you're stuck with me. but--the last thing she said to me was, ""promise you'll take care of kayla,"" and i am going to. but you're gonna have to help me, okay?"
10168,Lynette,then why have it?
11297,Lynette,"oh, god. seriously? fantastic. thank you. it's just two quick hours, and then we'll get you right back home with your mom. thank you, andrew. okay. bye-bye."
9787,Lynette,"and that's why we packed you extra cookies so you could share with all your new friends, remember?"
12910,Lynette,"kids, we are going to support your father by working in his restaurant."
12730,Lynette,here's what we're gonna do. youno questions. you--you're porter now. let's go in. come on. come on.
11877,Lynette,what are you doing?
11458,Lynette,"no, no, the profit margin."
10089,Lynette,"hey, you're out early."
12985,Lynette,"hey, tom. no, still waiting. big surprise. they're running behind at an ad agency. so did any of those other places call back? seriously? six interviews and nothin'? well, i should probably try and keep my game face on here. i'll--i'll call you later. i love you. bye."
8941,Lynette,"that's add medication. my kids take this, or they almost did. i thought it was supposed to calm you down."
8797,Lynette,"you know what, it's not gonna change until you resolve your issues with that man."
10649,Lynette,"all right, let's do this.i'm just going to check the focus."
11497,Lynette,okay.
13014,Lynette,"i'm confused. before, you didn't even want to talk to him. you weren't even sure i was good."
9712,Lynette,really?
12739,Lynette,"tom, i talked to every kid in his english class, the entire debate team. porter hasn't contacted any of them. well, hurry home. we gotta decide what our next move is. all right. i love you. bye."
12363,Lynette,"bree's in a horrible jam, and i told her we'd help cater the commitment ceremony tomorrow."
9322,Lynette,oh.
10739,Lynette,could you be all about shutting up!
11085,Lynette,a protest?
9236,Lynette,"well, you knew your father was having an affair, and it didn't seem to bother you that much. and that worries me, because if you can find it in you to condone something like that, then what's gonna happen when you've been on the road for forty years?"
11007,Lynette,yeah? okay.
9554,Lynette,you think?
12874,Lynette,you'll still be a celebrity in five minutes. come on.
12558,Lynette,so he's okay?
11746,Lynette,no! it's too late!
11276,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry. let's hear them. what are your reasons for bringing back joe bong hit?"
12147,Lynette,"hey, church buddy. look what i got."
11452,Lynette,okay.
11077,Lynette,"guys, why has it been so long since we've played poker? i really need this."
10091,Lynette,"yeah, but i probably should've just gone with it.gaby was just being gaby--having fun."
9788,Lynette,"you're gonna be great, parker. i love you."
10918,Lynette,"and you, i'm gonna see you on saturday, right? don't forget your swimsuit."
8943,Lynette,"oh, that's very kind of you, but i just smoked some crack a little while ago, so i better not mix."
9522,Lynette,you forgot your helprin file.
9088,Lynette,"it's just, i don't know this woman, i mean, not really. so she has a degree in sociology. well, big deal, who doesn't? my boys are a lot to handle. what if she's not up to it?"
12863,Lynette,"yeah, yeah."
12543,Lynette,don't give me that. you are having the kind of success i only dreamed of back in my ad days.
11216,Lynette,"oh,honey--jeez.do you really mean that,or are you manipulating mommy into feeling incredibly guilty?"
10451,Lynette,"well--actually,he's kinda right. he's got the concept down."
10924,Lynette,"it was awful, as always. i saw she was in pain, and i just walked away and--"
10244,Lynette,"yeah, something about the applewhites.i'm dying of curiosity."
10603,Lynette,i had already let you go.
9640,Lynette,"well, it's the middle of the day, and shouldn't you be at work?"
12280,Lynette,there are so many opportunities that you could look and see what's going on. i am not!
9706,Lynette,"okay, obviously, i'm gonna clean that up."
11556,Lynette,what?
10685,Lynette,"oh, apology accepted.you want me to walk you to your car?"
11706,Lynette,you are now officially the most beautiful bride that ever lived.
9709,Lynette,"makes you wonder, doesn't it?"
11703,Lynette,what's that supposed to mean?
11161,Lynette,"ya think? 'cause i just saw a take-out menu with a six-digit phone number, and i kept that to myself."
13066,Lynette,love it? i have cancer. i probably shouldn't even use the ladies' room
9351,Lynette,"really? wow, you're good."
9265,Lynette,think so?
13012,Lynette,"well, thank you, greatest friend, but i just accepted another job."
12267,Lynette,"well, actually, this is a different kind of doctor. you know, the kind you can talk to?"
9169,Lynette,i wish i would have known earlier. i would have arranged a sitter.
9802,Lynette,okay.
9469,Lynette,-we're screwed.
11569,Lynette,thanks. thank you.
10792,Lynette,he's got five more games in the season. he made a commitment. he's gonna see it through.
9387,Lynette,"too little, too late."
11424,Lynette,i hope.
11541,Lynette,"edie asked me to cater. i know, i'm a total who*e, but please don't rat me out to gaby."
11815,Lynette,"""kick-ass chronic""? uh-huh. you're a grandmother. shouldn't you be off somewhere knitting an afghan?"
12453,Lynette,he may be in love with me.
12787,Lynette,"yeah, well, what can i tell ya? i learned from the best."
10273,Lynette,hi.
13294,Lynette,"hi, mrs binks, is patty there? thank you."
11793,Lynette,"boy, you really don't wanna be here, do ya?"
13188,Lynette,sorry. i got nothing else. come inside and eat your pork.
10539,Lynette,"so,um--what happened?you said you were just gonna go in there and talk to him."
10691,Lynette,gonna go buy a pinata?
12326,Lynette,"i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i shouldn't have done that, but that was--that was horrible, what you said. and--you should never say that again. okay, so--come on. let's go."
12393,Lynette,what happened to your tenant?
11226,Lynette,my boss is waiting for me outside in his car. what am i supposed to do?
10115,Lynette,are you drunk?
13127,Lynette,"i was just afraid you'd overreact, like you're doing--right now."
9012,Lynette,i'm sorry. you were saying something about wind?
11835,Lynette,"oh, my god. ""hang 'em high"" has three syllables."
9033,Lynette,"yeah, it really does."
11286,Lynette,this could be the best thing that's ever happened to our family.
9993,Lynette,"could you can the attitude, nina?"
13301,Lynette,huh?what's going on?
10520,Lynette,i know.
12743,Lynette,oh.
10632,Lynette,"tom!i am trying very hard to be strong right now, and you melting down is not helping me."
11807,Lynette,i don't know. you came out with some interesting things before you swore off the sauce.
9684,Lynette,"remember that time when you were away in tucson, and i had a 104 fever, but i still managed to take the kids trick-or-treating?"
9243,Lynette,"mrs. mccluskey, why are you taking my flower pot?"
8942,Lynette,"seriously, you're taking your kids medication?"
10418,Lynette,i'm just telling you what the lawyer said.
10986,Lynette,yeah. i never make cakes. this is huge.
9071,Lynette,i would never treat you that way.
9680,Lynette,what's the matter?
10980,Lynette,"hi, bunny. i'll be right there."
12328,Lynette,okay.
9083,Lynette,you have my cell phone number. you call me if you need anything.
9724,Lynette,"oh, that's disgusting."
9869,Lynette,"oh, fun, but i can't go tonight because i promised the twins that i would help them finish their science project."
10105,Lynette,"really?wow, that was nice of you."
13171,Lynette,don't just walk away.
11834,Lynette,it's like chocolate love.
9038,Lynette,"while you're gone, i'll be here, paying bills and sorting laundry and cooking dinner, so what part of that sounds like a vacation?"
11607,Lynette,"yeah, i guess we were."
12175,Lynette,"i faced cancer and a tornado, but i'm running from this."
10553,Lynette,i am-- so happy and i'm so relieved.
9598,Lynette,"no, there's nothing to fix. we've changed. that's all i'm saying."
12817,Lynette,"jeffrey cuevas is retiring in september. i am the perfect person to step into his job, and that is exactly when parker starts kindergarten. the timing is like a dream."
10646,Lynette,settle down.
13071,Lynette,can you excuse us for one second? i need to go to chemo. i have cancer.
11434,Lynette,"i swear, i will be there in one second."
11089,Lynette,so that people could watch their kids and be vigilant.
12671,Lynette,we're going to protect our son.
10109,Lynette,"well,that's not entirely true."
8695,Lynette,touch every inch of your body until you're trembling.
10386,Lynette,on page 6 is an example of the new print ad. check it out.
11817,Lynette,sorry.
9894,Lynette,"you see? you see how it, how it moves with me? that's where the magic is."
11558,Lynette,"hi, mrs.mccluskey. would you like some cake?"
9577,Lynette,bye.
12561,Lynette,"the kids know everything's fine. they send their love. don't worry about anything, okay? just rest. i'll come back soon, okay?"
9061,Lynette,"claire, claire, please."
11193,Lynette,"and whoa, whoa, whoa, harry. eyes up here."
12836,Lynette,but it's 85 degrees outside. i've never done this before.
10214,Lynette,i'll go.
13259,Lynette,what's going on?
8770,Lynette,"i know, i was just trying to scare them into behaving. did you see where they went?"
10523,Lynette,"well,honey,in all fairness--those are all things you should be doing anyway."
10026,Lynette,"and that wasn't right of her. she shouldn't have been having sex with you. she's upper management. technically, it's sexual harassment."
12779,Lynette,mom--this is wrong. please.
10920,Lynette,"hey! mary alice, are you okay?"
9566,Lynette,it's too late. you said it.
9085,Lynette,"come on, one, two, three, get in, get in!"
11381,Lynette,"yeah, it is."
8759,Lynette,"yeah, the boys were acting up in the car, i couldn't get them to sit down."
9580,Lynette,i love you.
10659,Lynette,what are you being so coy about?
10297,Lynette,what?!
8998,Lynette,"nothing, i'm tired."
8911,Lynette,"so if i went back to work, then you could stay home and take care of the kids."
9391,Lynette,oh.
12222,Lynette,"oh, my god! stop it! what are you doing? stop. hey, easy. easy. just stop it! oh!"
11491,Lynette,thanks.
13205,Lynette,what's his extension?
11261,Lynette,dinner is in an hour. you know the rules. and so do you.
11993,Lynette,"guys, i can't be any clearer on this. i am not taking her back."
10972,Lynette,"oh, here they are! hey!"
11750,Lynette,"and,edie,you look great. especially,you know,given the circumstances."
9892,Lynette,okay.
12069,Lynette,"no. no, no, no, no, no. you stay here."
12417,Lynette,--in your father's convertible.
9649,Lynette,"yes, i am sorry. i am so, so sorry. i didn't want to hurt you. but i was trying to protect our family. if you got a promotion, we never would have seen you. you would have been traveling all the -"
12000,Lynette,"okay, she wasn't perfect, clearly. but she gave birth to us. we owe her our lives, and now that she needs us, we can't just turn our back on her."
12758,Lynette,"we can get a restraining order to protect you, and bob thinks there's a good shot at getting the case dismissed."
12583,Lynette,i think--it's great.
12563,Lynette,"okay. okay. we'll find more. just rest now, okay?"
11250,Lynette,hi--ed.
10233,Lynette,so did you do that solo?
13134,Lynette,yes. and we shall never speak of this again. i am embarrassed enough.
11421,Lynette,"wait, wait, wait! please don't do this. please. i am at the end of my rope."
12270,Lynette,"actually, you do. that's why you're here. so let's just wait and talk to the doctor, okay?"
10768,Lynette,"oh, my god, nora. did you actually-- well, i'm-- i'm very sorry. i had no idea. but your life is better now, right? you have a beautiful daughter, and you have that fun job at the--pancake house."
11715,Lynette,you heard about this from my kids?
11274,Lynette,"no, i fired him, and you are gonna stay fired."
10594,Lynette,"i am not interested, and if you wanna keep those fingers, i would move 'em away from my body. thank you."
12926,Lynette,tom!
8851,Lynette,so do i.
9595,Lynette,because she now comes to our house everyday to remind you of what i'm not.
12011,Lynette,"the morgue is listed under government offices, right?"
9694,Lynette,"""i have. but when i moved over to cenn and simmons-"
11303,Lynette,give me that.
9248,Lynette,boys! get your little fannies inside. guys?
11515,Lynette,okay. back to edie--i'm not sure i'm comfortable ganging up on her.
10502,Lynette,what?
8767,Lynette,"okay. uh. oh! uhh. i'll be right back, mommy'll be right back."
12491,Lynette,and what makes you think you know what my husband needs?
9273,Lynette,you know whoever came up with the motto love thy neighbor clearly lived nowhere near karen mccluskey.
10615,Lynette,okay.
13085,Lynette,urn is empty. let's do it.
12003,Lynette,"here's how you can help--don't visit for the next few years, 'cause it seems fairly likely i won't have stopped hating you by then."
8899,Lynette,apparently we're in competition with one other family. a generous donation will ensure our kids beat them out.
8867,Lynette,we need you to recommend porter and preston. we can't even get an interview.
13072,Lynette,and what do you want from me?
12944,Lynette,"oh, my god. that would be great. and if he gets the job, you can actually cash the check."
9511,Lynette,"uh, mr mullins had a spare. why didn't you open the door?"
9401,Lynette,she is so opening that letter.
11777,Lynette,thank you.
12851,Lynette,"no. thank you, but i can't accept this. however, i would like to know how much i'm not accepting. $20,000? how many cookbooks are you selling, woman?"
8971,Lynette,"actually, i'm getting ready for a dinner party tomorrow night. six people."
11140,Lynette,"hey,whoa!whoa,whoa,whoa!okay. what the hell are you doing?! stop, stop! stop screaming! stop!"
12953,Lynette,"mwah. ohh. you couldn't shave? come on, tom. you need to look nice. bree's going to a lot of trouble for this dinner."
8815,Lynette,oh. didn't have a good time?
10993,Lynette,or wherever.
11267,Lynette,are you high?
10262,Lynette,what?
11384,Lynette,"i have to get to the restaurant early. is there any you could come over and get the kids off to school? yeah, they are ready to go. so what do you say? oh, great! thanks. i owe you big-time. okay, bye."
11682,Lynette,"oh, it's not as bad as it sounds. it's, um, hodgkin's lymphoma, and apparently, if you're going to get lymphoma, that's the kind you want."
12360,Lynette,"no, i don't, but let's say i did. katherine has this aloof quality. it's like she's always trying to keep us at arm's length."
9329,Lynette,"hey, guys, over here."
10319,Lynette,"on any given day,how many glasses of wine do you put away?"
8788,Lynette,i'm in.
10882,Lynette,you leased a building without telling me?
10094,Lynette,no!
10722,Lynette,um. how about steve? you know what? i hear his family has money.
8987,Lynette,"no, really, hear me out. put a big spotless scrub ad between a woman and her cashmere sweater, and i guarantee you'll get her attention."
9546,Lynette,i'm listening.
11692,Lynette,just say thank you.
8733,Lynette,i love you.
10291,Lynette,"honey,i was so worried about you."
13279,Lynette,"okay. so, now that i'm going to do some, heavy lifting, i believe i have a right to talk about the changes made to the script?"
10949,Lynette,"nora, please!"
12881,Lynette,meaning that i've created my own failure?
9713,Lynette,two days.
12689,Lynette,"oh, you are such a gentleman. sit your ass down."
12358,Lynette,"okay, then."
12087,Lynette,"no. no, i guess not."
11027,Lynette,"okay, he wasn't there. he doesn't know. look, he had a wall full of pictures of half-naked boys in swimsuits."
9403,Lynette,hey. shut up.
11443,Lynette,he has a history--using cocaine.
9003,Lynette,this is awful. carlos must be just devastated.
10684,Lynette,oh.
8787,Lynette,"i'm not being flip, i'm just pointing out a reality."
12415,Lynette,"and while i thought grounding you was an appropriate punishment, your dad convinced me. i was being a little too hard on you guys."
8827,Lynette,i have a theory.
11728,Lynette,"okay,honey.just give me a minute.give me a minute."
10796,Lynette,"easy hours, big paycheck, access to great parties--yeah, what was i thinking?"
9701,Lynette,not until i change her diaper. could you just give me two minutes?
9872,Lynette,nina.
13055,Lynette,mm. i'll take her. kinda looks like cat litter.
8898,Lynette,you think mike is a carl in disguise?
11615,Lynette,stop! don't say it! you cannot say these things.
11953,Lynette,wusses!
10907,Lynette,hey.
10786,Lynette,"well, daddy should have checked with mommy, so she could have a chance to tell him why he's wrong. hey, you're playing."
11572,Lynette,my kids know you're not a witch.
9120,Lynette,"well, i'm just trying to plan my day."
10582,Lynette,"what are you, a scientist?"
11795,Lynette,"yeah, you told me, but, jeez, gaby,don't you care enough to make an effort?"
10398,Lynette,ouch.
11739,Lynette,okay.i'll jump right on it.
9128,Lynette,what?
12357,Lynette,kayla--i'm sorry how everything turned out.
9126,Lynette,thanks.
10812,Lynette,"so if tom was cheating, you wouldn't tell me?"
12607,Lynette,yeah. what's wrong with you? you've been antsy all night.
8813,Lynette,"no, we got perp-walked down main street usa."
10327,Lynette,"if you really wanna do this now, shut the door.okay,sure, i was a little bitchy.but you know why? you did a half-ass job in there."
9399,Lynette,didn't you once say you never mix business with pleasure?
12943,Lynette,seriously?
12727,Lynette,tom
12260,Lynette,i know. turns out the whole thing was kayla's idea.
13280,Lynette,all right. off you go. thanks.
9955,Lynette,"look, mcclusky, i am as worried as everybody else in this neighborhood, but i just don't think that we-"
11049,Lynette,"i'm sorry, guys, i just--i guess i was really tired. where's your brother?"
9576,Lynette,"yeah, he's just getting his briefcase."
9970,Lynette,where's penny?
11897,Lynette,i don't think katherine will bother herself over a tree house.
13285,Lynette,i'm not the one who forgot my mitt.
12660,Lynette,thank you.
13245,Lynette,that's your advice hope an opportunity just drops in my lap? might as well start shopping for beekeeper suits.
11870,Lynette,yeah. good as new.
10211,Lynette,what about the two of us working and living together?i think that could be a recipe for disaster.
9408,Lynette,"yeah, that's great. what am i gonna do?"
11199,Lynette,you're home early.
12294,Lynette,yeah?
11221,Lynette,the future of the restaurant is at stake. it is time to get creative.
9716,Lynette,i think i'm asking you to clean the house.
12733,Lynette,"bob, we're so sorry. we meant to tell you. we really did."
9957,Lynette,sure.
10264,Lynette,ed!
10881,Lynette,tom! no.
12051,Lynette,"we, me, tom, the kids, that family you've come to know and love."
9228,Lynette,"impressed? impressed? i-tom, please, please don't tell me you're all right with this!"
12450,Lynette,oh. sorry. enjoy!
13176,Lynette,"i thought you wanted to do this, to take a break and stay home."
10712,Lynette,"hey, sacrifices must be made, tom!"
11251,Lynette,"uh, on the mend, but i'm gonna be there bright and early monday morning."
10996,Lynette,she won't.
8796,Lynette,"i'm sure it's not that bad. he's coming to the party, right?"
10038,Lynette,this is not what i wanted. i just wanted you to be nicer.
12784,Lynette,"no, sweetie. i was driving home last night, talking with your dad on the phone, and two cars in front of me had an accident. and i thought, damn, that could be me. and then i thought, that could be me."
9770,Lynette,okay. good point. and i'm sorry about your hair. i can see why you're upset.
12229,Lynette,and tom was at the founder's ball with me.
9048,Lynette,"i'm not twisting anyone's arm. if i make a better offer, why shouldn't a qualified person reap the benefits? so come on--where can i score some high grade nanny?"
9221,Lynette,yeah--
11005,Lynette,thanks.
8701,Lynette,okay.
10988,Lynette,that would be great. i really appreciate it. okay. thank you.
10622,Lynette,and you must be nora.
9018,Lynette,go to hell.
9444,Lynette,you did. why do i do it? this compulsion to stick my nose where it doesn't belong. i mean--
9069,Lynette,just give me a second.
9030,Lynette,"no, i'm not. i can't do it. i'm so tired of feeling like a failure. it's so humiliating."
12126,Lynette,i got time for that.
10776,Lynette,how's your back?
12831,Lynette,"tom, i am in pain. do you mind? you'll see, tom. i know. people say that you--you can't have it all, but i know we can."
10525,Lynette,what? yesterday you were up in arms.now you're ready to cave?
10441,Lynette,teeth?
9919,Lynette,is that true? did they beat you up?
11457,Lynette,"sorry. i'm sorry. but it's gonna be worth it. okay, so tell tom the secret of your risotto."
11747,Lynette,bravo!i'm sorry.i'll get you a new purse.
10889,Lynette,"it means childish, stubborn, careless with my money and your futures."
9231,Lynette,that man is not coming back in this house.
12951,Lynette,what are you doing?
11704,Lynette,"great, so in the middle of everything i'm dealing with, you're gonna throw rick in my face."
10084,Lynette,"oh, sure, but--but maybe next time you could try juggling instead."
9456,Lynette,"bree, thanks again for watching my boys. you sure they weren't too much to handle?"
11927,Lynette,"hey, judas."
10002,Lynette,edie! i am sure susan's father will like her just fine.
11418,Lynette,what? what? why? why? what happened?
10598,Lynette,what?
9813,Lynette,i'm so sorry i couldn't get here sooner. i forgot my husband had to take our youngest to the pediatrician--
10568,Lynette,uh-- no.
13209,Lynette,"bruce, i want you to meet my husband tom. tom, this is bruce."
9748,Lynette,hey.
11119,Lynette,"oh, sweetie, we don't watch tv during dinner."
11410,Lynette,"yeah, his name is rick coletti, and he was a sous-chef at cucina."
11148,Lynette,you have good timing. i just got all the kids to sleep.
10861,Lynette,mm-hmm. yeah.
8802,Lynette,"no! but when i say, we've been invited to a party, don't whine about your exhausting 60-hour week. put on your dancing shoes, and take the mother of your children out for a good time."
9127,Lynette,"just so you know, if we go to the mall, we can go to the shoe store. you said you wanted new running shoes."
9714,Lynette,and why have i never seen the sparkling part?
13116,Lynette,mm-hmm.
10213,Lynette,i'm not saying that.
12258,Lynette,do you have any idea what you've done? someone could have been killed.
12251,Lynette,"no, sorry. i hope you find him."
11909,Lynette,"no! this is about personal freedom--specifically, my personal freedom to take down that jackbooted hausfrau."
11236,Lynette,thanks.
10239,Lynette,"i told ed you were my husband,and he was cool with that.he really wants to hire you.so who am i to stand in the way?"
9927,Lynette,"hey, guys. we got snacks!"
13226,Lynette,"i know you're discouraged, but-- letting our son make a huge mistake is not gonna help anything."
11382,Lynette,"hey, andrew. ah, thanks. he's gonna be okay. no. no, absolutely not. we will open tonight as usual. hey, it's gonna be fine, andrew. i will take care of it. it's my job now. okay. see you soon. bye."
11840,Lynette,let me ask you something. do you remember what i wore to the junior prom or what part i had in the play that year?
10869,Lynette,"start small, have an italian theme,create some cash flow, and then later on,expand into the pizza thing."
11862,Lynette,"gaby, i am his wife. he's supposed to love me--not my body, me--my--my soul. why can't he make love to my soul?"
12646,Lynette,get off of her! get off of her! i'm calling the police!
9309,Lynette,"look, wait, wait. i know what this means to you."
8947,Lynette,"okay, lady, that's it!"
12505,Lynette,"as you can see, the graphic works just as well on a free-standing display unit. neat, huh?"
12983,Lynette,really?
9209,Lynette,"oh, parker, um, forgot his catcher's mitt."
11503,Lynette,we're trying so hard to protect them from this. there are just some things that kids don't need to know about.
12903,Lynette,not yet.
10751,Lynette,"ah, it's like an eight hour drive."
10850,Lynette,isn't he the one that asked us for a loan last christmas?
11431,Lynette,here you go. sorry for the wait.
12058,Lynette,yeah. mm.
9646,Lynette,"so, did you have a fun day?"
10137,Lynette,oh?
10116,Lynette,come here.
9367,Lynette,"i guess. still, i can't help but feel a little guilty. after all, my kids started an entire lice outbreak."
8852,Lynette,"boys, will you come in here please?"
9255,Lynette,"well, too bad for you. okay, start with a big em, little c. good."
10208,Lynette,oh!no! no!i do not think that that is a good idea.
12193,Lynette,"uh, yes."
11101,Lynette,where are you going?
9968,Lynette,i'm sorry. i've been doing this for seven years. trust me. you have to have eyes in the back of your head.
11430,Lynette,"i have been doing everything i can to keep our heads above water. i can't do you, too."
9116,Lynette,"i don't know how she did it, but edie managed to make this all about her."
10944,Lynette,"sweetie, it's mommy. i need to talk to daddy."
8818,Lynette,"i don't know. rex announced that he and bree are in counselling. she retaliated with this whole revelation which i won't even go into now. and the bottom line is, he stormed out. clearly there's trouble in paradise."
13196,Lynette,"uh, we live in a community property state, so half that face is mine."
9526,Lynette,"i almost forgot, your file. here."
12161,Lynette,"oh, then you won't get what you want?"
9688,Lynette,you!
8895,Lynette,"listen, i'm sorry about mike. i know how much you like him."
9839,Lynette,you're so sweet. come here. i love you. you all right? go get dressed.
11916,Lynette,but it's my kids' tree house. they really need it.
9849,Lynette,so why don't you go out and get in the game?
10749,Lynette,what are you doing here?
9855,Lynette,wow.
11571,Lynette,"well, it turns out our new babysitter isn't working out too well. feel up to another tour of duty?"
13160,Lynette,"tom, i have a 7:00 a.m. meeting. how about i take a long lunch, and you do me twice at work tomorrow?"
10184,Lynette,are you saying you're unhappy?
11340,Lynette,"i had a lot of time to think tonight, and i realized you were right. we have to keep the romance going, no matter how tired we are. the only thing worse than just going through the motions is not bothering to go through the motions."
11179,Lynette,every cent we have is circling the bowl and tom never said a word. why didn't he come to me?
11780,Lynette,"he was getting so emotional. it felt like the last 20 minutes of ""brian's song"". so--i guess i'm in the market for a new chemo buddy."
11046,Lynette,"hey, hey, not now, parker."
10272,Lynette,i'm coming!
11105,Lynette,"okay,they're here. now listen, stand up. kayla has been through a lot, so when she walks in the door, i want you to make her feel welcome, okay? give her a hug and be really nice."
9670,Lynette,hi. what are you doing out here?
8785,Lynette,"hey! i know, our dinner."
10533,Lynette,"you sure?i might punch you,too."
10107,Lynette,okay. yeah.so exact what are you doing here helping out?
9862,Lynette,"um, why don't you ask trudy? she loves going out."
10977,Lynette,"there she is! hi, my little bunny!"
12473,Lynette,and i wasn't!
10778,Lynette,"no, i don't wanna fight. in fact, i was thinking--if you can't find something you like in advertising, maybe you should cast a wider net."
10706,Lynette,"okay, whoa, whoa, take a deep breath. you don't wanna break up with a guy because, in a weak moment, he calls you a whore."
11019,Lynette,"hey, don't touch anything. i'm just gonna write a note, and then we'll go."
11043,Lynette,"oh, sorry. never made it past the living room."
10331,Lynette,"did you give it 100%?well,exactly. so? big deal.go work up some new ideas,and then we'll go over it during lunch.okay?"
13158,Lynette,"oh, they're all starting to blur. look, i worked till 3:00 a.m. last night. i'm exhausted. how about we take a rain check?"
11964,Lynette,no.
13243,Lynette,i know tom. he's going to learn how to count to ten in chinese then he'll get bored and move on to his new dream of becoming a beekeeper.
11153,Lynette,too late. i looked--and it's great.
10252,Lynette,guys--
10975,Lynette,"well, let's see how well you do on a morphine drip."
11307,Lynette,"hi. i need to rent fifty chairs by tonight at five o'clock. what? why not? what do you mean, it's bar mitzvah season? there's no such thing. you still have five. i will take those. scavo."
13010,Lynette,yeah! how'd you hear about it?
12529,Lynette,you know what this tastes like? more.
9356,Lynette,"okay. she's going through something, and i'm sure she'd prefer it to be private."
8865,Lynette,i really do appreciate you guys staying and helping.
12228,Lynette,"no. i am saying that if anyone had an ax to grind, it's rick. maybe he set the fire himself so he could blame my husband."
12668,Lynette,what about rick's restaurant? porter and his brother burned that down.
11029,Lynette,he wasn't technically home when i went inside.
12898,Lynette,"if we sell this place now, we can escape with some dignity and maybe even some money. but if we keep on going like we are, we're gonna lose everything."
11992,Lynette,"lucy, every fight we have ever had has ended with my foot on your neck. i guarantee that this one's gonna end the same way, too."
12444,Lynette,"yeah. our porter, the kid who communicates with grunts and shrugs, writes this--beautiful, heart-wrenching poetry."
11578,Lynette,"but--but the doctor said your recovery would take months, and it's only been six weeks."
10435,Lynette,"no,you don't.in fact,i hate liars."
12236,Lynette,okay.
11133,Lynette,yeah. i should treat her as badly as i treat my own children.
12815,Lynette,i was planning to go back to work.
10935,Lynette,"i don't, but i didn't want the first four, and they're starting to grow on me."
9383,Lynette,and the best you could come up with was letting my kids take the fall?
10544,Lynette,"in all the years we have been married,i have never seen you lead with your fists."
12540,Lynette,hey.
10673,Lynette,"no, no, no, of course not. in fact we're just having a quiet afternoon at home.the kids are so bored tom and i were thinking about taking them out for ice cream."
12062,Lynette,"ida, is there any chance that we could put little toby upstairs?"
11745,Lynette,"oh,i'm gonna be sick!"
12342,Lynette,so what do i need to do to keep my kids?
12675,Lynette,your husband's blaming porter.
9698,Lynette,"stu, you are an idiot. you're an idiot, an absolute idiot."
12311,Lynette,no. what are we gonna do?
11154,Lynette,"yes. i love the font, the color, everything. i am so jazzed to see the restaurant."
12613,Lynette,i followed you to the warehouse. i know everything.
9468,Lynette,my mom used to beat the hell out of my sisters and me. and i won't do it. i will not become my mother.
8721,Lynette,"years! uh, how are you, how's the firm?"
12292,Lynette,"yeah, or a child with problems can lead to a dysfunctional family. i mean, kayla's the one that got my kids to light a fire and jump off the roof."
10773,Lynette,he doesn't hate advertising.
9310,Lynette,"so was mine, but i'm here, aren't i?"
9274,Lynette,"really, i, i recall no such motto."
7754,Gabrielle,"okay, just let me handle this."
4309,Gabrielle,no.
5876,Gabrielle,oh.
5187,Gabrielle,i'm not discussing this anymore. you can rot in here for all i care.
6255,Gabrielle,"well, now that my divorce is final, i need a reason to wake up in the morning. i have this hole in my life that can't be filled by shopping. that's right, i said it."
7211,Gabrielle,"and you're going to make sure he goes straight to the top, aren't you?"
5162,Gabrielle,thank god you were in flats.
4395,Gabrielle,so cancel.
4227,Gabrielle,"no, you promise to be home every night this week."
6503,Gabrielle,"oh. okay, why don't you support me from the lobby? i have some networking to do. my girl just won the pageant."
8392,Gabrielle,"oh, were you, miss ""they offered me $100,000 a year""?"
5707,Gabrielle,"no. no,no,no.i want that woman's baby,and i'm gonna get it."
8174,Gabrielle,i'll go get it.
5955,Gabrielle,"no, you can start dinner."
4603,Gabrielle,what do you want me to do?
8084,Gabrielle,"okay, let's skip to the important part - who was it?"
6606,Gabrielle,"you know, intimidate him. do the whole jealous, latin ex-husband thing you do. tell him if you can't have me, nobody can."
7394,Gabrielle,so we just wanted you to know that we're here for you.
6197,Gabrielle,"carlos, could you come help me?"
4904,Gabrielle,"yeah, why has it been going around?"
5277,Gabrielle,bree.
6072,Gabrielle,gabrielle. i think that's the first time you've ever called me that.
5081,Gabrielle,there you go. i am so proud of you.
5644,Gabrielle,"i'm the one who was sleeping with your son,but it's over now."
8633,Gabrielle,"because all she ever does is put me down. if you'd pay attention, you'd see what i'm talking about."
6747,Gabrielle,hi! can i help you?
8170,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. what?
5391,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. guess i am bad.
6763,Gabrielle,"it's not going very well, is it?"
5975,Gabrielle,"come on out, i have your lunch.xiao mei! xiao mei!"
4400,Gabrielle,"well, as it turns out, pershing modeling academy has an opening for their summer program. would you like me to sponsor you?"
7840,Gabrielle,so--next playdate's monday at 1:00?
8233,Gabrielle,"oh, i'll be more willing to forgive once his bonus check comes in."
7532,Gabrielle,he called you? why didn't he ask me?
7359,Gabrielle,"oh. well, i'm still sorry, though."
8442,Gabrielle,do you wanna tell what it is.
6306,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't know."
6660,Gabrielle,i mean it this time.
4599,Gabrielle,hi! so nice to meet you.
5248,Gabrielle,i don't think so.
5068,Gabrielle,"hi, are you rita?"
8117,Gabrielle,my rage just needs to catch its breath. okay. okay. i am willing to forget this entire incident if you just go jump in that bathtub right now. what do you say?
7627,Gabrielle,"hey, sweetie."
4374,Gabrielle,"honey, it was only a small neighborhood game."
4498,Gabrielle,"tom, say something!"
5105,Gabrielle,"say what you want, but john rowland loved me like no one ever has. not as a trophy or as a possession, but for me. he loved me."
6034,Gabrielle,"no, carlos!"
7214,Gabrielle,"milton lang doesn't want me to leave victor until after he runs for governor. once the election's over, ka-ching!"
4648,Gabrielle,"honestly, yes. i am a model."
5230,Gabrielle,you can't just quit in the middle of a hearing.
6198,Gabrielle,it'll just take a second. please?
4755,Gabrielle,that was before i knew we could trade a couple months in prison to keep it!
6144,Gabrielle,"no! ooh, i remember. carlos was so annoyed. what did you say, hon? ""he may have that trophy, but i've got you."" ain't life funny?"
5168,Gabrielle,"no. i'm talking about us. our relationship, our marriage. carlos, you're gonna be a father. when you get out of here, you're gonna need to get a job and make an honest living, for me and our child."
8397,Gabrielle,"carlos, do you have to go back to work?"
7547,Gabrielle,"honey, i can't find my nail file. have you seen it?"
6322,Gabrielle,"but i'm helping them.they love me!wait,please,vern,you have to give me a chance to fix this."
7233,Gabrielle,"for the last time, carlos, stop calling me."
7161,Gabrielle,no way. it's gonna take more than a guy with mini binoculars and a bag of doughnuts to keep me under lock and key. i'll be there as soon as i can.
5079,Gabrielle,"not that it's any of my business, but it's your body. i wouldn't change anything unless i really wanted to."
7459,Gabrielle,"and how is he gonna park a car if he can't see? feeling pretty stupid now, aren't ya?"
6958,Gabrielle,what are you working on so late?
6497,Gabrielle,i mind. we're divorced. i can't keep running to you every time i get scared. i want to be the kind of woman who can take care of herself.
5766,Gabrielle,"you know,i'm a little tired, but it's not too bad."
4428,Gabrielle,"not really. they'll be able to determine the make and model of the car, but without any eye witnesses, no one seems very optimistic."
4744,Gabrielle,and please tell rex i said hello.
6141,Gabrielle,"thank you. carlos. carlos, this is my new friend phil lopez."
6622,Gabrielle,he's devastated.
6917,Gabrielle,jumping up and down and hugging me.
5354,Gabrielle,it's so good to see you!
7125,Gabrielle,why'd you take your wig off?
7107,Gabrielle,"look, lady, you need to calm down. you're getting a reputation around here for having a stick up your ass."
7857,Gabrielle,great. so do i have anemia? is that why i've been so tired?
5492,Gabrielle,have you guys noticed how friendly betty's been since that body was found in front of her house?
6174,Gabrielle,"uh, it's just that they're filthy, and i was gonna wash 'em for you."
7638,Gabrielle,yes?
6250,Gabrielle,"uh, way."
4210,Gabrielle,"well, you know what you need to do. you need to get there early, spend a little time with mike before little barracuda gets there."
4391,Gabrielle,who the hell's dana?
6012,Gabrielle,"oh my god, what are we going to do?"
5856,Gabrielle,"mm hmm.well,if we are so friggin' close,what's the big deal?it's nine months out of your life."
5348,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's him."
6403,Gabrielle,to sabotage my new relationship.
4623,Gabrielle,"love is not enough. where would we live, here with your roommates? the only decoration in the bathroom is a bong!"
8281,Gabrielle,"why? so you can go get another ""haircut""?"
6727,Gabrielle,you're in love with me?
6210,Gabrielle,"you got a new job? honey, that's wonderful!"
7940,Gabrielle,"uh--next weekend, uh, carlos and i have plans."
7885,Gabrielle,"oh! you are the mrs. hildebrand. well, you're carlos' favorite client. well, mine, anyway. i bought this top with that crazy tip you gave him."
7299,Gabrielle,they don't know that someone else was us.
6318,Gabrielle,really?
5784,Gabrielle,"yeah,honey,can you take that downstairs?thank you."
4266,Gabrielle,how long are you going to be?
6924,Gabrielle,so all of this planning and attention to detail--that's all been about your image?
7517,Gabrielle,"oh. yes. okay, let's go. let's go, roxy. let's go, roxy. let's go. let's go in the car."
8606,Gabrielle,remember that dinner party she gave? she had 20 place settings of tiffany china. how does this happen to someone who has tiffany china?
6218,Gabrielle,carlos? honey? carlos?
7117,Gabrielle,"when you saw me flirting, you smashed a glass. when victor heard i had an affair, he started crunching poll numbers. i need a man who cares enough to explode when he thinks he's gonna lose me. i don't just love you. i love the way you love me."
5446,Gabrielle,"yes,i would have."
4251,Gabrielle,"yeah, that thought did cross my mind."
8335,Gabrielle,okay.
5900,Gabrielle,"oh, it's perfume,not toxic gas."
8259,Gabrielle,yeah. and brad saw me. why do you think your bonus jumped from a stuffed chicken breast to 30 grand in a day?
6166,Gabrielle,"i got a second wind last night, so i went to a bar. that's where i met jason. we spent the whole night how did you put it? pulling the trigger. so did i hurt you, or should i keep trying?"
6143,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! that's right! that's right! you were up for the latino businessman of the year award that phil won."
7483,Gabrielle,"that's not the point, you blind idiot! i'm saying if all i get in exchange for this crappy situation is a nice parking spot for my $8 manicure, then i'm taking it!"
5645,Gabrielle,"oh,my god!"
7242,Gabrielle,the girls are gonna be so jealous.
5674,Gabrielle,"look,carlos--it doesn't matter what we've done in our past.being a parent means rising to the occasion,and that's exactly what we're gonna do when we bring our baby home."
4720,Gabrielle,why?
5244,Gabrielle,then it's nothing.
5052,Gabrielle,"be careful, carlos. up until now, i've been really lonely in that big bed of ours, but when you're rude to me, it makes me wanna be not so lonely."
7395,Gabrielle,"no, we thought that you just might need someone to talk to."
5151,Gabrielle,"reservation! you're eating alone, remember? and i have a feeling it's not the first time!"
4991,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos. whoever said you were the father?"
4745,Gabrielle,"bree, hi."
5086,Gabrielle,"so, her boobs are fine. and, honestly, what he's doing to her self-esteem is just cruel. i feel sorry for her."
5995,Gabrielle,"you heard me. and i want the bedroom stereo,want the marble console and that painting of saint augustine."
5542,Gabrielle,"you are threatening me with an annulment?that conniving little bitch put you up to this, didn't she?didn't she?"
5673,Gabrielle,"well,then who the hell does?i mean,look at all the idiots popping kids.okay,they're not any more qualified than we are."
8093,Gabrielle,excuse me.
5313,Gabrielle,"no! no, you can't come in!"
5038,Gabrielle,yeah. us girls have to stick together. we shouldn't let a stupid piece of paper ruin our life.
6953,Gabrielle,"you gotta be kidding, right? i mean, we just finished a campaign. you're not about to put me through another one."
5685,Gabrielle,"with her dna,the only thing that kid's gonna be winning is best in show.look, carlos, i am sorry,but i want a pretty baby,so let's find another mother."
6232,Gabrielle,"do you know how much i was worth?! when we met, i was on the cover of magazines. i had a career and a future, but i gave it all up for you, and what did i get in return?"
5973,Gabrielle,but you're gonna get married.you wouldn't buy a car without at least taking it for a little test drive.it's not like you've never slept with a guy you weren't married to.
6594,Gabrielle,"i sort of threw myself a little birthday party.so if you don't mind,i'd like to get back to my dry heaving."
4212,Gabrielle,okay.
4586,Gabrielle,"i wouldn't go too much farther, you're going to end up back in prison."
6317,Gabrielle,"is it about the girls' makeup? 'cause i got them each their own makeup kit, custom-tailored to match their skin tone. and i got melina some wax. i know she's only eleven, but those greek genes are gonna kick in any day now. what?"
7862,Gabrielle,"do it. i need to hit something, and it needs to be you."
4677,Gabrielle,when?
5304,Gabrielle,"i go shopping, you rip toilets out of the wall. different strokes."
4851,Gabrielle,what do you think you are doing?
5340,Gabrielle,"okay, should i say something?"
6984,Gabrielle,what are you talking about?
7039,Gabrielle,"uh, you, uh, have a birthday coming up, and, uh, i don't know what to get ya."
6388,Gabrielle,what are you doing at mike's house?
6623,Gabrielle,"it's my fault. i should've known he couldn't handle the whole ""let's be friends"" thing."
7998,Gabrielle,"oh, boy! who knew healthy food could look so tasty? okay, dig in. what's wrong?"
8079,Gabrielle,oh. great. and what's the signing bonus for that-a cup of pencils? i thought you were gonna get a better job. what happened to the world being your oyster?
4528,Gabrielle,why? what else could they take from us?
5112,Gabrielle,"well, someone had to tend to the yard. you were busy elsewhere."
4796,Gabrielle,"honey, are you okay?"
7487,Gabrielle,you look very handsome.
7128,Gabrielle,"i'm saying men are visual. hell, i have a whole closet full of costumes. you need to give tom something to look at, something spicy, like--"
4308,Gabrielle,"you know, juanita, this is so like you. i take you on a nice shopping trip and you find ways to upset me."
7100,Gabrielle,a blister. sounds like blister.
5861,Gabrielle,would i lie to family?
5945,Gabrielle,completely.
6897,Gabrielle,"honey, i am so sorry. i hope you don't hate me."
4574,Gabrielle,"carlos, this is not like new york where i made thousands of dollars a day modeling haute couture. i'm doing boat shows. i spend eight hours a day doing this!"
6029,Gabrielle,that's it! i take my invitation back! you are no longer welcome in my house!
4343,Gabrielle,this is getting really weird.i think we should go to the police.
4427,Gabrielle,"oh, they're terrific. we just appreciate you all stopping by."
6674,Gabrielle,you and i are gonna be so happy together.
8214,Gabrielle,don't take that tone with me. i am paying.
7497,Gabrielle,don't give me your blind sarcasm. i saw a collie on tv who could push a lawn mower. do you have one of those?
4291,Gabrielle,i think he's hiding something.
8512,Gabrielle,"okay, great. now if you'll excuse me have to get back to my gardening."
8235,Gabrielle,"but do you know how much overtime carlos has pulled? how many trips he's taken? he's killed himself. for god sakes, don't do this to my jeweler."
4431,Gabrielle,it's a fairly recent development.
4317,Gabrielle,"but i thought teenage girls bored you, john? i thought what we had was beyond that."
7072,Gabrielle,"susan, good news. we can come to the party after all. hey, you know who else you should invite?"
7396,Gabrielle,"oh, shoot. did i miss mass? was it at 9:00?"
5262,Gabrielle,ralph! i need help getting dressed. get in here! now!
7839,Gabrielle,"oh, we totally agree. kids are forced to grow up way too fast these days."
4905,Gabrielle,"what? wait? you think i'm pregnant? no, i'm not pregnant."
5655,Gabrielle,"so just to be clear,some slutty cheerleader gets knocked up by the soccer coach behind the local gas 'n gulp,and she is going to make sure we're quality people?"
7695,Gabrielle,"i know, but so much? you could've gone back for a second piece."
7001,Gabrielle,what's going on here?
6926,Gabrielle,hey!
8299,Gabrielle,"fine. i'll tell you. i have been having an affair with a married man, and it's come to that point where i can't even look at myself in the mirror. so i want a new style that says i'm not a giant turd of sin."
5199,Gabrielle,really. what are you gonna say?
4338,Gabrielle,"juanita,i had no idea."
5603,Gabrielle,"oh, really?oh, of course you can stay!oh!"
6139,Gabrielle,"oh, i think it is. you know, introducing your spouse to someone you're about to have sex with? there's only one reason to do that--pure hatred."
7935,Gabrielle,"oh, that's okay."
7045,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. she doesn't want to talk about that."
6148,Gabrielle,"yoo-hoo! carlos! i'm making a snack for phil.do you want something to eat? some sour grapes, perhaps? maybe a little crow? okay, we need to move this over there."
6706,Gabrielle,sorry. excuse me. excuse me. excuse me. sorry. i'm afraid mr. lang has to take an important meeting in his limo--now.
5094,Gabrielle,hey--
4478,Gabrielle,have you been thinking about me?
6131,Gabrielle,it's over between us. just move on already. forget me.
5298,Gabrielle,"jeez, how are you feeling today?"
6004,Gabrielle,or the stairs. what do you want?
4466,Gabrielle,for what?
5349,Gabrielle,hello.
6140,Gabrielle,"oh, i think i do. phil, come meet my basically ex-husband--"
6685,Gabrielle,go ahead. yell all you want. you can't force me to take off this dress.
4157,Gabrielle,absolutely not. you are much too young to smoke.
7203,Gabrielle,"sorry about that, victor. uh, anyway, it's over. uh, we both know it wasn't working. uh, good luck on everything, and you don't have to call me back. okay, bye-bye."
7936,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah."
5088,Gabrielle,i just realized rita and i have a lot in common.
5048,Gabrielle,"you know, taking away my access to our account, that's just vindictive."
5022,Gabrielle,john! how did you get in here?
5518,Gabrielle,why? you either care if men leer at me or not.and you made it clear that you don't.so what's the point?
5564,Gabrielle,"uh, depends.what have you heard?"
8132,Gabrielle,yeah. it's very effective.
7162,Gabrielle,"boys, time to get paid."
7154,Gabrielle,i say we keep smiling and look for the hidden cameras. i think we're about to get punk'd.
5332,Gabrielle,"you don't have a, a window thingy."
6161,Gabrielle,shut up.
4559,Gabrielle,uh! i guess i am.
5030,Gabrielle,"honey, we are so sorry."
5756,Gabrielle,hurry up!
4987,Gabrielle,"ah, ah, ah, pregnant, cave man, remember?"
8232,Gabrielle,please. it was our pleasure. how did we do that again?
4897,Gabrielle,"yes, yes, i know. my husband and i went through a downsizing phase. but we've snapped out of it. life is good. and this would make it so much better."
6220,Gabrielle,there was nothing you could do.
8247,Gabrielle,"you're right. i'm sorry. it's just--i really wanted to buy this bracelet i saw today downtown in this little jewelry shop. you know the place, honey. it's right next to the, lexington hotel."
4134,Gabrielle,"there's no way i can just work that in, carlos."
7389,Gabrielle,"oh, crap."
7934,Gabrielle,"gee, i don't know. i can't really see the screen anymore."
8173,Gabrielle,"and by ""we"" and ""food,"" you mean bree, right?"
6909,Gabrielle,"oh, yes! let's celebrate. more chocolate. and just so you know, if i was a lesbian, i'd totally do you."
7841,Gabrielle,"yeah, and the water was as flat as the ad campaign. your martini was as dry as the ad campaign. let it go."
5573,Gabrielle,so is that all she said?
8679,Gabrielle,just get here as fast as you can
8324,Gabrielle,"hello? maria. calm down. calm down. okay, we're coming over."
7670,Gabrielle,that's the closet!
6417,Gabrielle,sorry for doing this.
4432,Gabrielle,we'll talk about this later.
8143,Gabrielle,"wow! jimmy choo! oh, carlos! these aren't even in the states yet. what's the catch?"
4680,Gabrielle,"justin, what are you doing up here?"
4461,Gabrielle,"betty, listen to me."
4151,Gabrielle,what?
5592,Gabrielle,"well, first of all,that was her idea.second of all,i can't have this conversation until you've tasted her crab puffs."
4901,Gabrielle,eight months. six with good behaviour.
8155,Gabrielle,"well, it was before my husband moved me here to east nowhere. seriously, i don't know how you girls do it."
8400,Gabrielle,"right, that's why i didn't suggest a longie. oh, come on. i'll have your eyes rolling back in your head in three minutes flat."
4919,Gabrielle,"yeah, i just didn't realise how disgusting meat could be."
5815,Gabrielle,"okay, no, no!wait, what about a car?or college?tuition's a killer these days.i could help you out."
6479,Gabrielle,i'm on a date with zach young. nothing's ever gonna seem weird again.
4482,Gabrielle,"oh, that! uh-- he was helping me adjust the seam in my stocking, and from your angle, it must have looked a little weird."
5725,Gabrielle,"libby,you didn't tell us you had a boyfriend."
8630,Gabrielle,isn't it just easier to shut down your hoo-ha until he gives in?
6543,Gabrielle,"wow. why don't you just hum it, okay?"
7607,Gabrielle,"well, isn't her room enough?"
7417,Gabrielle,hero? why am i a hero?
5930,Gabrielle,xiao-mei--how did you rip your panties?
6928,Gabrielle,mike said no?
7854,Gabrielle,"what are you gonna do, take up piano and get a contract with motown?"
7744,Gabrielle,"what do you mean, they're unhappy? they're rich! they have jewels and cooks. they use ""winter"" as a verb."
4629,Gabrielle,so paul said that zachary killed dana?
7596,Gabrielle,and edie threatened to use that to--
7338,Gabrielle,"like what? ""rot in hell, you maggoty who*e""? that woman ruined our lives. if she had kept her mouth shut, we wouldn't be running away."
4691,Gabrielle,"oh, i can, and i will, you little worthless piece of crap."
6052,Gabrielle,what's that?
7470,Gabrielle,i'm just dropping off a few letters. you might as well just wait here.
8287,Gabrielle,katherine hung one of mike's paintings over the mantel till she found out susan painted it. then she took it down.
7219,Gabrielle,you embezzled $10 million?
5314,Gabrielle,"no! uh-uh! i can take care of myself, okay?"
4550,Gabrielle,yeah. so what do you got?
5745,Gabrielle,i forgot the lamaze book in my purse!
8408,Gabrielle,"you know, i should get back."
4665,Gabrielle,"really, why?"
8248,Gabrielle,"absolutely. now if you'll excuse me, i'll leave you two to business. all this negotiating just goes right over my head."
5009,Gabrielle,"yes, well, carlos, in some circles, beating people up at all is frowned upon."
6176,Gabrielle,got it.
6717,Gabrielle,fantastic. as good as with carlos.
4259,Gabrielle,can i say something? i'm glad paul's moving.
5153,Gabrielle,i will tell you what is inappropriate. you making sweeping assumptions about the state of my marriage.
4795,Gabrielle,okay.
8278,Gabrielle,"two. two.there's, uh, shayla the hairstylist and then there's this other shayla i know who's a home-wrecking whore."
7917,Gabrielle,"oh, lap of luxury, how i've missed sitting in you."
5534,Gabrielle,stop it. let's just enjoy the here and now.we're together. our marriage is back on track. life is good.
4457,Gabrielle,"oh, no."
7037,Gabrielle,so?
7567,Gabrielle,"uh, he did the same thing to me. perv!"
7018,Gabrielle,what?
4848,Gabrielle,"tonight just, whatever you do-don't call me beautiful."
6515,Gabrielle,"yeah, here's how it's gonna work. we drive to the restaurant separately, we will not have dessert, and under no circumstances will you touch me. capisce?"
5890,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know.that's why i had the movers put it in here, where we sleep."
7691,Gabrielle,"ha! we can only hope, with your dna running through her veins."
5409,Gabrielle,tell me where he is!
8145,Gabrielle,carlos!
5036,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
5270,Gabrielle,"when i decided to marry carlos, i told these girls i would spend the rest of my days being rich and in love and childless, and they laughed at me, and they said i would just end up being another fat hausfrau living a life that i didn't plan. i'm not gonna give them the satisfaction of knowing they were right."
5166,Gabrielle,obviously are.
7555,Gabrielle,"oh, it sounds like he's leaving. i hope it's not 'cause of me. maybe i should go apologize."
4265,Gabrielle,use the side entrance.
8591,Gabrielle,i don't have to get you anything. and stop acting like a spoiled brat. i am not spending a fortune on a bed you don't need.
8188,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't get it! i'm only a few pounds away from my runway weight."
5111,Gabrielle,"hello, john. long time, no see."
6596,Gabrielle,we had sex last night!
4274,Gabrielle,see? socks. she uses them as rags.
8354,Gabrielle,you told me you slept with her.
4980,Gabrielle,she found out it was in self-defense. i think they've cleared everything up.
5305,Gabrielle,"oh, please. what do you think?"
4500,Gabrielle,i can't do that!
5059,Gabrielle,"well, how much money?"
4580,Gabrielle,"no, you promised, no babies!"
7055,Gabrielle,"oh, sorry. i stopped off to get you some magazines."
4360,Gabrielle,the coffee is a little hot.
5484,Gabrielle,okay.
7609,Gabrielle,"okay, first of all, you're a pig. second of all, don't say things like that. ellie's my friend."
6492,Gabrielle,"oh, some global financier, saw me on the cover of paris match. good-looking, just not my type."
4965,Gabrielle,oh my god!
7008,Gabrielle,and money.they've been remodeling for weeks.
7366,Gabrielle,"okay, i made a mistake. i'm sorry, but victor wasn't entirely blameless. he ignored me. he used me politically. oh, yeah, and he tried to kill carlos. so i think i'm entitled to whatever he had."
5352,Gabrielle,"no, of course not! he's a moron!"
8088,Gabrielle,"oh, my god."
8211,Gabrielle,yeah. are we gonna get a break soon?
8293,Gabrielle,i do-- and so does my personal shopper and pilates instructor.
7120,Gabrielle,"well, i bought you an expensive gift, and i'm not giving it to you unless there's a party with people who can see how generous i am."
4288,Gabrielle,i think he's lying.
5964,Gabrielle,"would you rather go live with mr. solis in a dingy one bedroom apartment with no air conditioning and no cable?huh?no, i didn't think so."
7400,Gabrielle,"okay, this may come as a little shock to you--but guess who's getting married again? and i was thinking, maybe you could perform the ceremony. is tuesday good for you?"
8228,Gabrielle,"oh, i think i've changed a little bit."
6509,Gabrielle,you wouldn't even let your own daughter go out with him. you said he was a psycho.
7246,Gabrielle,where's the crew?
7005,Gabrielle,"yeah,it's a great house."
5551,Gabrielle,"mm, not that long ago.look, i sorta told a fib,so--how many ""hail marys"" is that gonna set me back?"
6755,Gabrielle,that's for calling me a maid!
7734,Gabrielle,right.
8231,Gabrielle,"boy, dinner without the kids--it's nice to eat without having macaroni thrown at you."
7849,Gabrielle,"i don't care. oh, sorry. it's just--mommy really misses her friend, and mommy's gonna be really sad if her friend doesn't show up soon. now go downstairs and play. mommy has some praying to do."
5600,Gabrielle,oh!
6590,Gabrielle,please tell me that once contained a mint.
4433,Gabrielle,"in case you've forgotten, before we got married, we made a deal. no kids."
8404,Gabrielle,"carlos, do you realize since bradley died and you took over, we haven't had sex once? i miss you. i wanna spend time with you. now move the creamed corn and do me!"
6689,Gabrielle,"oh, cheese doodle."
7460,Gabrielle,"oh, don't play victim with me. i have to walk in heels all day long. you get to sit in a chair and roll."
7184,Gabrielle,"uh, does not ring a bell."
5785,Gabrielle,xiao-mei?
5371,Gabrielle,i saw your nun!
8029,Gabrielle,why aren't you wearing your blackout glasses? the doctor says your eyes can't be exposed to any light. i can only handle my husband going blind once per marriage.
4914,Gabrielle,"yes. and its impossible, i'm on the pill-which you probably think is a sin, but it works. it's a 99.9% effective sin."
7918,Gabrielle,"ooh, we'd love to."
8261,Gabrielle,"no, we can't tell her. we'd have to give the money back."
7482,Gabrielle,"oh, you bet i am! every morning, the toothpaste has to be to the left of the sink, because if it's not, you can't find it, and i have to put it there. and--and sometimes-- i don't know--i'm driving, or i'm in line at the bank and i think, ""is the toothpaste there?"" so then i have to run home and check because i don't want you reaching for the tube and not being able to find it. i just didn't think this was how it was all gonna turn out, carlos. i didn't think that every day for the rest of my life, a part of me is always gonna think, ""where's the toothpaste?"""
6904,Gabrielle,"honey, you're gonna be okay. all right? we're gonna help each other through this."
4230,Gabrielle,you free at 4?
8193,Gabrielle,"ah, yeah. times are good. not for her. her, mrs. mccluskey said something about you losing 5 pounds in one day. how'd you do that?"
4561,Gabrielle,"you know, with their perfectly crafted interior, and peaceful, quiet tuning."
5408,Gabrielle,you! what the hell did you do with my husband?
6427,Gabrielle,bill and i split up.
6614,Gabrielle,zach! how can you claim to care about me and lie to my face?
7471,Gabrielle,just picking up some vitamins. i'll be quicker if i do it myself.
7092,Gabrielle,"oh, okay. i will pick adam."
7411,Gabrielle,holy matrimony. bring it on.
7012,Gabrielle,"really? because she thinks you're getting married.everyone else thinks you're getting married.so,again,best wishes."
8503,Gabrielle,"ladies, start your blenders."
6344,Gabrielle,after the harsh things you said about amy? i don't think so.
6765,Gabrielle,excuse me. excuse me. excuse me.
4280,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
5782,Gabrielle,"ahh.oh,and xiao-mei,mr. solis does not need to know about this,okay?"
8089,Gabrielle,no. i think i should stay and clean this up. it's a--huge mess.
8316,Gabrielle,you know what? you're right. i'm out.
6018,Gabrielle,what would make you think i would have even consider taking you back?
8670,Gabrielle,"okay, boys, thanks for your hard work, but maybe it's time to go home and take a shower--preferably a cold one."
8549,Gabrielle,"well, it's a big, fancy dinner. of course."
4169,Gabrielle,"you guys check out mary alice's clothes? size 8, hah! she always told me she was a size 6. guess we found the skeleton in her closet."
6204,Gabrielle,sure. why not? for old time's sake.
6093,Gabrielle,"and it pains me to sell it. it's just that my lawyer told me what you're offering for spousal support, and i can't get by on that."
7876,Gabrielle,"get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch."
4776,Gabrielle,"eyes front, padre."
6194,Gabrielle,"so go to ian! tell him you made the wrong choice, and he's the one you wanna be with. what have you got to lose?"
7143,Gabrielle,and we can rinse it off--in three to five minutes. but before we do that--
5328,Gabrielle,"no, it's not, because i know what you're thinking."
8481,Gabrielle,"we, uh--also came to give you your mom's ashes."
7751,Gabrielle,here. take good care of her.
6860,Gabrielle,um--doesn't ring a bell.
8607,Gabrielle,i bet i know what happened. she drank it away. that one new year's eve where she got so plowed she fell in the koi pond--
5887,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei, what are you doing in our bed?"
6192,Gabrielle,"no! no, you're not! you're a great wife and a great mother. although-- don't you have children?"
5502,Gabrielle,"well,um,thank you,ralph,for bringing this to my attention."
6935,Gabrielle,"god, i should have my head examined for even agreeing to this. who the hell cares about swiss jewelry anyway?"
8399,Gabrielle,how about a quickie?
5450,Gabrielle,you're not serious.
6584,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna take a little nap, okay? just for a minute."
4217,Gabrielle,carlos!
7681,Gabrielle,"look, my daughter was invited to a princess party, so i can't let her be the only girl there without a princess dress."
4140,Gabrielle,"no, if mary alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known. she lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes."
7621,Gabrielle,"uh, you know, he's a handyman. he knows how to--get in there--and make stuff work."
8307,Gabrielle,"oh, shayla, he's lying. she's pregnant."
8019,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's when you thought you were gonna be blind forever. but if this operation works, i just don't want you to be disappointed."
5932,Gabrielle,"um, and, doctor, uh, while you're down there, could you check if she's still a virgin?"
7138,Gabrielle,that's nurse gaby to you.
6541,Gabrielle,i don't know. maybe it's because i think we're both-- adrift. it'd just be nice to have a pal who gets what i'm going through. why don't you play me something you wrote?
4761,Gabrielle,"well, i'm saying your mother was a sensible woman. she wouldn't be comfortable with all these bells and whistles. maybe this one. wood veneer!"
5928,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei, do you have a second?this is probably silly, but it's been bothering me.when you said,""please don't kill him,"" did you mean carlos?"
5672,Gabrielle,"carlos,we're catholics,okay?god is pretty johnny one note on the whole subject of procreation.hey,and will you stop with this defeatist attitude?okay,do you wanta baby or not?"
4167,Gabrielle,come on.
8264,Gabrielle,"oh, really? what is it?"
5355,Gabrielle,what happened?
8118,Gabrielle,"i am gonna scrub that smug look right off your face. oh, my back!"
5676,Gabrielle,"there are ways to get babies,carlos.it just might cost us."
6127,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing in my room?"
6983,Gabrielle,yes. i can see that.
7364,Gabrielle,no. i'm not thinking about money today. i'm burying my husband.
6642,Gabrielle,there is no relationship. this is our last date.
8467,Gabrielle,why? don't tell me you're depressed because you lost some stupid game.
6393,Gabrielle,yeah?!
8295,Gabrielle,it means--tomorrow i'm going to the mall to get my hair cut by a slut.
7582,Gabrielle,"oh, hey, guys! you were up there a while. can i see it?"
7499,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry. i was on my hands and knees that day, scouring the bathroom floor because you refused to pee like a girl."
4203,Gabrielle,"you better hurry, we don't have a lot of time."
6382,Gabrielle,are you kidding? what could be more romantic?
7467,Gabrielle,"let me go! well, it's official. i'm going to hell."
7799,Gabrielle,true. now here's a valuable lesson for you.
8150,Gabrielle,not the jimmy choos. they're the only friends i've got.
8180,Gabrielle,mommy needs to lose a few pounds. you wanna help mommy be beautiful again?
8345,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. how's that going?"
4921,Gabrielle,"i think i can honestly say, no, i'm not."
7188,Gabrielle,"boy, that was a close one, huh?"
6067,Gabrielle,"your company? you have a company now?oh, my gosh, when i met you, all you had was a bike."
8394,Gabrielle,"fine. we're a couple of users. the big question is, are we still friends?"
4349,Gabrielle,you like that?
6564,Gabrielle,don't get too full. you have to leave room for dessert.
6442,Gabrielle,"carlos, this isn't funny. i am scared to death of this maniac."
7588,Gabrielle,what are you doing?
5757,Gabrielle,read the instructions!
8536,Gabrielle,i never thought i'd do it to carlos.
6325,Gabrielle,"i don't think i'm better than you. hell, i envy you."
5716,Gabrielle,"well,like they say,there's no such thing as a free lunch."
5854,Gabrielle,"no,xiao-mei,you don't have a choice.it's either this or go back to china."
5056,Gabrielle,why?
8242,Gabrielle,really?
5886,Gabrielle,"fine. i'll learn to live without product.but when my hair starts smelling like hair,i don't wanna hear a word."
8296,Gabrielle,you didn't.
5374,Gabrielle,"oh, i invited sister mary hot pants over for lunch."
5301,Gabrielle,"oh, well, it was a little soon for that, don't you think? i mean, how can you name something the size of a walnut?"
7098,Gabrielle,that's not fair. she's like the charades ninja.
5506,Gabrielle,"scott's web site,with pictures of me on it.well,say something."
6929,Gabrielle,"no. no, it's okay. victor was kind of on the fence about it, too."
5127,Gabrielle,really?
5735,Gabrielle,"wait,if it's not frank's,then whose is it?"
6022,Gabrielle,"okay, here's the drill. my ex is here and i want to piss him off so just act like you're all hot for me and there's a hundred buck tip in it for you."
7832,Gabrielle,"she didn't wanna hear it not with bethany running around the house, screaming ""intercourse!"" at the top of her lungs."
7145,Gabrielle,"well, don't just stand there. come in. we have lots of food and fun and surprises."
8119,Gabrielle,"celia! juanita! i am not gonna ask you again to pick up these clothes! you've got till the count of three! one-- two-- three! you can hear me, right?"
4738,Gabrielle,sure. why?
7674,Gabrielle,she was always telling us how terrified she was.
8256,Gabrielle,"well, ice is solid too, until it cracks and you're drowning in freezing water. i'd stay in counseling if i were you."
5218,Gabrielle,we know what you did to mrs. huber.
6932,Gabrielle,that must feel really great.
6272,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry. is just, this outfit is hideous!"
6535,Gabrielle,"okay, i'm just a little--grossed out, that's all!"
7701,Gabrielle,"it's a new game i invented, and you're winning 1 to nothing!"
8270,Gabrielle,shh.
8100,Gabrielle,so--is eye care included in the health plan? 'cause that's obviously a big issue for carlos.
5382,Gabrielle,what?
6418,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna make it up to you, okay? once i'm done, i'll send you flowers."
8151,Gabrielle,you're right. it's not.
6277,Gabrielle,where do you get off talking to me like that? i shot thirty-six covers by the time i was twenty!
7521,Gabrielle,"well, sorry it didn't work out. i gotta run."
6066,Gabrielle,who's there? i can't see you.
7311,Gabrielle,"boy, let me think. uh--mm--no. no, i haven't."
5857,Gabrielle,"""ruined""?"
6231,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm helping you pack. think of all the money you're gonna save on bubble wrap."
6269,Gabrielle,"it's gaby. gabrielle marquez. you shot me in milan, remember?"
8148,Gabrielle,he has a name. what's your name?
7472,Gabrielle,i just have to drop off a gift to my manicurist. why don't you listen to the radio?
5223,Gabrielle,"dear david, who knew you could actually bleed? sincerely, your stunned co-workers."
5824,Gabrielle,yes?
7639,Gabrielle,okay. bye.
5190,Gabrielle,what are you doing here?
8426,Gabrielle,"carlos, get back here! carlos! could you at least scratch my nose?"
6280,Gabrielle,"oh, it was fine."
6214,Gabrielle,you are a bastard!
7723,Gabrielle,what's happened to my life? we used to have help. now we are the help!
4505,Gabrielle,"no, it's okay, people didn't even notice."
6226,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, give it to me! carlos! yes! yes! carlos--"
8122,Gabrielle,"now that you've gone back to work, they won't listen to me. they know you're not in the next room, ready to drop the hammer. help me!"
7334,Gabrielle,they said victor's getting out of the hospital--tomorrow.
4823,Gabrielle,"well, that's too bad. cos i'm not signing that piece of paper."
8500,Gabrielle,how about the woman in the overalls?
5540,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry, but you're just gonna have to accept it.there's nothing else you can do."
6369,Gabrielle,"oh. well, i think dedication should be rewarded, so i have a little surprise for you."
7063,Gabrielle,"but on the plus side, i made a pretty good career out of knowing how to smile when i didn't really feel like it. but i can't pretend with you. not when i'm scared i'm gonna lose you."
6788,Gabrielle,yeah! i wanna know who's putting that dopey grin on your face.
4283,Gabrielle,it did cross our minds.
7066,Gabrielle,a charades party? didn't you just throw one?
7104,Gabrielle,okay.
4577,Gabrielle,"you know, edie, i'd love to go, but, um, i just got back into modeling, you know, just for fun, and i have a gig tomorrow. i can't leave 'em hanging."
7082,Gabrielle,excuse me.
8282,Gabrielle,"well, bradley, we all want things. for instance, i would like carlos to have a week off next month."
4326,Gabrielle,"oh, for god's sake, bree, you're a woman. manipulate him. it's what we do!"
4663,Gabrielle,"well, it's not really an emergency."
6936,Gabrielle,"and, of course, it's the hottest day of the year. all the guests are out there sweating like pigs. god, at this rate, my reception's gonna look like the finish line of the boston marathon."
6433,Gabrielle,"i'll give you this--you're gonna be a tough act to follow, carlos."
6345,Gabrielle,"oh, um, the grass, honey, and my allergies--go ahead and practice. i'll watch you from here. are you sure i can't help with anything?"
6529,Gabrielle,"yes, my lips, not my esophagus!"
8023,Gabrielle,"about two seconds ago. up until then, it was pretty touch-and-go."
8639,Gabrielle,sorry. bad heart. floor's all yours.
5149,Gabrielle,excuse me?
4913,Gabrielle,you are out of toilet paper. bree i'll call you later.
6153,Gabrielle,"no, no, i'm not talking to you. back off!"
8653,Gabrielle,"you know, the girls have chores, too. it's how we teach 'em responsibility. speaking of which, uh--curfew's 10:00, 11:00 on weekends. does that seem reasonable?"
7333,Gabrielle,"um, go. you guys go."
5902,Gabrielle,"from the second xiao-mei got pregnant,you have found a million and one ways to tell me that that baby is more important to you than me."
6056,Gabrielle,"don't you love this?oh, god bless tom for taking the kids camping."
7216,Gabrielle,"carlos, you're not working right now, and you know we'll never be happy if we're broke. we need this."
5763,Gabrielle,do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?
6055,Gabrielle,"you can call it blackmail, carlos, but the court calls it ""spousal support"".so unless i get a check by monday, your shower buddies from jail will be throwing you a welcome back party."
6902,Gabrielle,please. mike is not karl.
5916,Gabrielle,"honey, they didn't know all the details, but a witness said that they saw you run into the carpool lane to pick up a lawn chair that had fallen off some truck, and then a bus hit you right in front of the road crew.why aren't you at the road crew?"
8382,Gabrielle,"yeah, okay. what are they paying?"
7955,Gabrielle,"okay, we're done here. good-bye. am i not making myself clear? get off my property!"
8386,Gabrielle,"so did you get a good office? were the people nice? oh, what about lucy? do you like her?"
6422,Gabrielle,"what?! no, he's obsessed with me."
4295,Gabrielle,paul and zach are fighting again.
8668,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. ana, the houses so clean."
7248,Gabrielle,so you're gonna drive this thing by yourself?
6032,Gabrielle,no!
6158,Gabrielle,"oh,god,yes!oh,ride 'em,cowboy!oh,yes,god!take me home,philly!you should wear a saddle!yes! yes!"
6189,Gabrielle,not what i was gonna say.what i was gonna say is with all his conniving and trickery i still love carlos.
5888,Gabrielle,"well, what's wrong with the guest bathroom?"
6589,Gabrielle,"okay,listen to me very carefully,and this is no time to be vague.what exactly was i amazing at?"
4193,Gabrielle,let go of me.
7904,Gabrielle,where? where does she live?
8315,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, i'm not that person anymore. i've changed."
4354,Gabrielle,"well, he did break into your house. i mean, the kid is obviously troubled in some way."
7201,Gabrielle,"victor, it's me. i got your message. i've gotta be honest, i'm very annoyed that you're not coming home today like you promised. i told you i have something very important to tell you, and i wanted to do it in person, but now you're gonna be home for another week, and i can't wait. victor, i'm leaving you. i-- can't believe i'm ending my marriage on a hotel voice mail. this is very tacky. you're forcing me to be tacky, victor. i am not a tacky person. i am very, very classy. oh! hang on one second."
5777,Gabrielle,"fine,fine,fine!"
8097,Gabrielle,"so, bradley, if carlos were to come work for you, what would a typical week look like?"
4313,Gabrielle,it's not my fault. juanita hasn't let me out of her sight since she got here.
7247,Gabrielle,what? who's gonna bring us umbrella drinks and salute us when we walk by?
6303,Gabrielle,"now i want you to pretend you're on the runway--flashbulbs are popping, everyone's looking at you, envying you, and they're all thinking the same thing--isabel horowitz is smoking hot! go, isabel! go! you're doing it! isabel, you're doing it! that's it! keep going!"
5610,Gabrielle,"for some people,but we're talking about you now,mother."
6522,Gabrielle,"okay, deal, you little skunk."
4652,Gabrielle,"oh, right. oh, here. here you go. thank you. come again."
6994,Gabrielle,okay.wait!aren't you gonna kiss the bride?
7501,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa! no more doggy treats. she's had enough."
5780,Gabrielle,"oh,come on. i won't make you do windows tomorrow."
6641,Gabrielle,"uh,for the same reason you forgot to sign the check.you've been working me since the second we met,and i've been on to you every step of the way.what?what's so funny?i just called you a manipulative jerk."
7647,Gabrielle,hello?
4992,Gabrielle,is john here?
5521,Gabrielle,what?
4247,Gabrielle,"don't look at your feet. don't look at your feet, look at the road. look at the road. ow. uh, okay, find your balance. find your balance. okay, it's all you. it's all you, you're doing great! okay, stay to the right. watch the car. watch the car. watch the car! are you okay?"
8113,Gabrielle,"juanita, it's time for your bath."
5596,Gabrielle,"you like nice things? that's why i think you're stupid,for not wanting to stay here.you could be around my nice things all the time,taking care of them--how fun would that be?well,i'm sure it's a lot more fun than you'd have in that tiny,godforsaken village of yours.you know,we're probably more alike than people would guess.i'm from a small town, too.my folks had nothing.that's why i love america.anything is possible."
5606,Gabrielle,"carlos,what are you doing?"
4606,Gabrielle,i'll see what i can do.
5903,Gabrielle,"no! men can't help it.when they become fathers,they become lousy husbands,and some wives don't mind,but you didn't marry one of those women."
8675,Gabrielle,"i care about the message it sends to my little girls, and i'm starting to care a little bit about your tone."
6235,Gabrielle,it's kind of on the fritz.
7133,Gabrielle,you are still sleeping with edie?
7097,Gabrielle,yeah! let's play!
4670,Gabrielle,"i'm flattered, but no, thank you."
4908,Gabrielle,"and another thing, i don't want a four door. i want a sexy little convertible. and i want to buy one. right now."
6780,Gabrielle,what are you waiting for? get the champagne.
4389,Gabrielle,"fine, to heck with it. i'm not gonna risk my neck to protect you. i'm calling carlos."
6912,Gabrielle,"no, not exactly. just a--small change of plans about the wedding."
4320,Gabrielle,so why are we arguing?
7516,Gabrielle,roxy--look what i've got. come on. come on.
5204,Gabrielle,what?
6137,Gabrielle,"does her pimp want the rest of the money? you know, there is some cash in my purse."
4542,Gabrielle,you don't think she is--
6443,Gabrielle,"the guy broke into the house. he went from secret admirer to stalker. for all i know, he's trying to kill me so no one else will have me."
6757,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, i'm gonna hang on to these. they're a little revealing."
7136,Gabrielle,"okay, just don't panic, okay? we're gonna get the salve or ointment or whatever it is you put down there, and we're gonna be fine."
7000,Gabrielle,no!i would rather try and work it out with victor.
7706,Gabrielle,"hey, i'm protecting her. she doesn't know the truth yet. women only have five seconds to be young and beautiful, and then it's gone. and then before you know it, we're old and fat and married and wondering where our beauty went."
7594,Gabrielle,it's one of ellie's customers.
8280,Gabrielle,you're using me as an alibi now?
8556,Gabrielle,"oh, fine. as long as you don't mind people thinking you're out on the town with your anemic lesbian sister."
6363,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetheart. i have a feeling i know what this is about."
5675,Gabrielle,"well,this is the first time someone told me i couldn't have one."
6221,Gabrielle,"oh, he's cute!"
4158,Gabrielle,"i found my earrings, we can go now."
8036,Gabrielle,per nulla? what does that mean?
4451,Gabrielle,"so what happens if i repent, later, like, say, when i'm 75?"
8678,Gabrielle,"you wanna see crazy? make one more statement like that, and i am throwing your ass out on the street. you care to test me?"
6556,Gabrielle,it could happen.
6875,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! congratulations!"
8379,Gabrielle,"well, un-accept it. you have to take this job. it's essential that you be there."
4488,Gabrielle,"i have some not-so-awesome news, so you go first."
6495,Gabrielle,"all right, off my porch."
7212,Gabrielle,can't say hello to a girl?
7884,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing home?"
7074,Gabrielle,"well, victor has a teachers' union thing on thursday. guess i'll see you on thursday. carlos, what's happening here? i mean, with us. why are we still sneaking around?"
4578,Gabrielle,"well, dig in. i am way too tired to eat."
4573,Gabrielle,"uh, no! no, no! that's unreasonable. what do they expect us to do for money?"
5613,Gabrielle,whoa!
6378,Gabrielle,you're kidding. when?
6473,Gabrielle,please. kids don't watch videos anymore. everything's digital.
8654,Gabrielle,this teenager thing isn't so bad.
6764,Gabrielle,that does it.
5377,Gabrielle,"oh, i get it. sort of like, today's convict is tomorrow's convert."
6167,Gabrielle,"so did i hurt you, or should i keep trying?"
6593,Gabrielle,no!
7484,Gabrielle,"here, honey. let me."
7611,Gabrielle,"okay, when this thing is over, let's not do the whole christmas card thing."
5983,Gabrielle,"boy, those people just don't have a sense of humor, do they?"
4779,Gabrielle,a crypt? you bought your mother a crypt?
8229,Gabrielle,"jean, wait."
4357,Gabrielle,i wasn't aware you two were friends.
4748,Gabrielle,we're gonna pay you back every cent. i promise.
7424,Gabrielle,it's a new recipe for beef stew. i think you're gonna love it.
6206,Gabrielle,"carlos, do you think we're making a mistake?"
5624,Gabrielle,"look,i don't care if she shot triplets out of her ass.it's not gonna happen.can you believe this?"
5432,Gabrielle,"yes, right. she has you flying halfway across the world to help the poor and there's perfectly good poor right here. for god's sakes, give a buck to a homeless guy."
5505,Gabrielle,"oh,carlos,i love you so much."
5064,Gabrielle,"honey, i think this is a mistake. if we give in to extortion, the guy's just gonna keep coming back for more money."
6831,Gabrielle,oh! hi. don't worry. i'm here now.
5609,Gabrielle,"what?he was worth,like,$6 million."
7038,Gabrielle,"edie! edie, wait! wait, wait, wait! don't go! don't go!"
5073,Gabrielle,okay.
8346,Gabrielle,i don't know.
6774,Gabrielle,"in a few months, i will be mrs.victor lang.."
5669,Gabrielle,preston!the other one's name is preston.
7405,Gabrielle,"okay, look, in the eyes of the church, carlos and i were never divorced. technically, the affair was with victor, and god smote him. so we're good. all right, yes, i've been a bad catholic. enough with the guilt thing. are you gonna marry us or not?"
5208,Gabrielle,"honey, i know you're hurt but are you sure you're not gonna change your mind? i mean, there's no turning back after this."
8250,Gabrielle,"uh, sure."
6742,Gabrielle,"well, just so you're prepared, consider this my pre-refusal."
4444,Gabrielle,damn you!
8190,Gabrielle,"jean, you didn't just give in to it. you slapped a piece of cheese on it. yeah, i said it. now just fix the hem. and this time, try not to leave the edges frayed. hey, edie! wait up!"
8112,Gabrielle,and the best part is you get to spend a whole day with just mommy!
5637,Gabrielle,"because--she knew exactly what was going on with alejandro,and she chose to look the other way."
7572,Gabrielle,you've been running a tattoo parlor out of my house?
6414,Gabrielle,why? they're just flowers. they're not government secrets.
7056,Gabrielle,why don't i go check if there are some other ones?
6569,Gabrielle,"uh, go ahead. i'm gonna open some more wine."
5908,Gabrielle,"fine, if you feel that way about it. hey, i'm sorry. i'm just a little on edge today."
4833,Gabrielle,"yeah, i'll do it."
4631,Gabrielle,what do you mean?
7742,Gabrielle,you wanna know what's humiliating? waking up one day and finding out you're invisible. now it's official. i've lost everything.
8561,Gabrielle,gotta go.
7388,Gabrielle,"well, look at me, monopolizing the widow. you go mingle. i'm gonna get you a cracker."
8683,Gabrielle,"if you say, a grandchild, so help me, god!"
7713,Gabrielle,no! that's only part of the problem. have you checked our bank balance lately?
4333,Gabrielle,while you get changed i'm going to run to the book store.
5291,Gabrielle,that sounds so nice. it's just i'm booked solid today. my head's gonna explode. can i take a rain check?
7435,Gabrielle,"wow. thanks for the vote of confidence. y-yes, the truth would have freaked me out, but i would have come around. if you had just had a little faith in me, i could have proven to you that i was up for the challenge, but you robbed me of that chance."
4318,Gabrielle,so why do you want to go back to something you don't want?
5959,Gabrielle,"we're out, but i got you a pickle."
7635,Gabrielle,let me guess. this story ends with you throwing your boyfriend's varsity jacket in the lake?
7122,Gabrielle,"yeah, we get a ball of yarn, and we each cut a piece that we think is just big enough to fit around your stomach, and the one closest wins a prize."
7452,Gabrielle,i'm poor now. remember? i have to mingle with the unwashed masses. what are you doing here?
6669,Gabrielle,"and normally that would creep me out, except it means that i can borrow this one-of-a-kind undari for our date!"
4659,Gabrielle,"john, you're a toy.you and me -- no future."
5700,Gabrielle,why?i thought they always annoyedthe heck out of each other.
6528,Gabrielle,what the hell are you doing?!
7086,Gabrielle,"oh, you gotta be kidding me!"
4840,Gabrielle,"oh, no. stop, carlos, stop it. put me down. put me down. let me go. argh! stop, you're hurting me. carlos!"
7361,Gabrielle,milton. hi. it's a nice turnout.
6827,Gabrielle,"well, aren't you in love with edie?"
6274,Gabrielle,"ready, ready!"
6520,Gabrielle,"not quite. the day starts with lunch, and that kiss, off the table."
6811,Gabrielle,"no, no! not cold, frozen! i want icicles hanging from that bi*ch's ears!"
8419,Gabrielle,"oh, if that were true, your pants would be around your ankles right now."
7897,Gabrielle,"no, just carlos. mrs. hildebrand is taking him to europe as her personal massage therapist."
7612,Gabrielle,"no, he's at braille school."
7942,Gabrielle,"yeah, and that's why we're leaving."
4455,Gabrielle,i know.
5462,Gabrielle,i'm honored.
8141,Gabrielle,just for the first 15 minutes after you walk in the door. then it's carlos time.
6215,Gabrielle,"oh, god!"
6249,Gabrielle,i should know. i was on the cover.
4434,Gabrielle,"well, we're not negotiating my uterus."
4911,Gabrielle,"okay, do you have a rest room?"
6798,Gabrielle,since you started doing things to piss people off.
5017,Gabrielle,"he knows how men look at me, and, well, i, i didn't exactly ease his mind. i falsely led him to believe i was having an affair. and, and before carlos's house arrest, he was always working, and he was never with me. and i thought that maybe if he believed i was having an affair, he would realize he loved me. and i know it sounds stupid, i do. i just-"
8545,Gabrielle,"yes, i do. do you have any idea how humiliating it was for me to get that call today? now every parent in town is gonna think that i let my 6-year-old wear makeup to school! and i want my makeup back. is it in here? why do you have this? juanita."
5749,Gabrielle,it was all worth it.
4323,Gabrielle,don't worry. i'll think of something.
6300,Gabrielle,"stop, stop."
5420,Gabrielle,"yeah, and you?"
4181,Gabrielle,"go, go!"
5752,Gabrielle,"wait,what is she saying?"
6883,Gabrielle,susan. hi.
5233,Gabrielle,"okay, yeah, david, if you don't get back in there right now, i will go get a gun and shoot you myself."
7765,Gabrielle,you sold me a lemon. that's what's up.
6313,Gabrielle,"well, some would smoke those unfiltered french cigarettes."
4264,Gabrielle,it's the cable guy. he's three hours late.
7758,Gabrielle,"andrew! unless you lower this price, we're walking--right now."
8454,Gabrielle,all right. come on. let's go.
4160,Gabrielle,why??
8543,Gabrielle,"hello? oh, hi, principal hardy. what's up? she's wearing what?"
6708,Gabrielle,"well, you laid out all your positions. don't you want to get acquainted with mine?"
5206,Gabrielle,where are we going?
6224,Gabrielle,"yeah, let's give him the scoop on the neighborhood."
4802,Gabrielle,"that's what i thought. the bastards. so, what if we won the lottery after carlos went to jail? could the government touch the money then? hypothetically. i see. and we could keep the house."
6396,Gabrielle,okay.
4172,Gabrielle,do you think this is why she--?
6549,Gabrielle,"no, thanks. but i do need a, uh, liquid soap dispenser. go."
6424,Gabrielle,there. i'm done. let's go.
5641,Gabrielle,ah.
4409,Gabrielle,"oh, don't be that way."
4365,Gabrielle,"yeah, i've seen who you've been busy with."
8471,Gabrielle,"oh, that's ridiculous."
6059,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm sorry."
5754,Gabrielle,taking our baby home.
7240,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, victor. a month in rio sounds like heaven, doesn't it?"
5909,Gabrielle,"you pay six bucks an hour. it's all about the perks, honey."
4253,Gabrielle,well since we're doing true confessions. carlos and i once broke a waterbed in cancun.
7661,Gabrielle,how about we split it 50-50?
8230,Gabrielle,"no, no. it's perfect. i just want to tell you how helpful you've been to me over the years, and i'm really grateful. thank you."
6205,Gabrielle,i've decided i'd rather catch up with an old one.
4380,Gabrielle,"juanita, what's wrong?"
8584,Gabrielle,"so when daddy finds out how much i spent, would it be okay if i used you as a human shield?"
6362,Gabrielle,excuse me?
6241,Gabrielle,"no,i mean it.the rage that i have felt in these past six months--if i had had a gun in the courthouse today--"
6254,Gabrielle,"well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. i'm just gonna fly to new york, meet with my old agent and take it from there. come on, you guys, this is exciting. be happy for me."
5057,Gabrielle,"honey, you and your macho pride. just tell him you're flattered, but you don't swing that way."
7067,Gabrielle,oh. right. guess it's time for another one.
5062,Gabrielle,"oh, right. sorry."
8258,Gabrielle,who? him and maria or him and the blonde i saw him kissing yesterday?
4727,Gabrielle,i hate susan's. she has all these weird scented candles. her house reeks of apricot. hose.
8304,Gabrielle,"focus, shayla! we are talking about how i'm ruining innocent people's lives."
6898,Gabrielle,"just so you know, i changed all my flowers."
8480,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. i can't believe we forgot."
7445,Gabrielle,"oh, please, carlos. i have a million errands to run, and i'd do it a lot faster without you. plus i'm having lunch with the girls first."
8688,Gabrielle,son of a bitch!!!
6415,Gabrielle,"well, okay, wait, wait, wait,let me explain."
4910,Gabrielle,excuse me. this home pregnancy test-is it a good one?
4675,Gabrielle,have you seen our checking account lately? we're broke. and then we have the mortgage payment coming up. we have property taxes..
6049,Gabrielle,you know what else would have been wise? sticking the right baby in the right belly!
8370,Gabrielle,to find out what mccluskey's sleeping mexican is doing in my house.
7665,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, can you carry the house keys? they don't fit in my purse."
8405,Gabrielle,"yeah, i've heard that before, and then tomorrow comes, and you're too tired."
5548,Gabrielle,"yes!at first it started with the love letters while he was in prison,and the next thing i know,they're spending day and night together--sneaking off to private bible study,and one-on-one spiritual consultation."
5205,Gabrielle,"but, carlos-"
7006,Gabrielle,"i'm not waiting for anything.oh,look,a moving van."
4718,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, no, it's not the money. it's just, uh, carlos and i are trying to prioritize some little things we need to do around the house."
8082,Gabrielle,"hi, bradley, it's gaby solis. i just talked to him, and he's intrigued. how would you like to come over for dinner and seal the deal?"
7798,Gabrielle,"that's it? no compassion? no, ""hey, let's split the bill and call it even""?"
5183,Gabrielle,"why not? he's experienced, he's intelligent, he's successful."
8121,Gabrielle,it's your children. they've run amok.
6723,Gabrielle,just trying to get your attention.
6271,Gabrielle,"people aren't gonna buy that, so here's what i was thinking. i slap on one of those gowns, i play tanya's big sister home from college to raise a little hell."
5913,Gabrielle,"carlos is dead, xiao-mei."
5005,Gabrielle,then we won't comfort.
4940,Gabrielle,i'm pregnant and it might be yours.
5698,Gabrielle,"yes, it's all natural,from her straight teeth to her ""c"" cup.and i know she's athletic because she's a pole dancer,so i really hope that my little girl inherits that as well.no, the athletic gene,not the pole dancing gene."
6119,Gabrielle,"oh. it was a swat. ted, does this hurt?"
6159,Gabrielle,"stop it, phil. i told you to beat it. no means no!"
5978,Gabrielle,"hi, hi, lee wang, right.remember me.xiao mei lives with me.you came over, we had lunch."
8518,Gabrielle,"all right, tom, you leave me no choice. you are no longer allowed to see patty."
6998,Gabrielle,in a few weeks? what?no! it has to be tonight!victor's in the bedroom right now waiting to consummate.
8216,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah, i quit that."
7336,Gabrielle,that's what i'm doing.
5133,Gabrielle,you can't tell me no.you work for me. you will make it happen!
4536,Gabrielle,it's not your fault. you didn't do anything wrong. i'll take care of everything until you're back to do it yourself. and you will be soon.
5004,Gabrielle,"honey, the doctors here are great!"
5234,Gabrielle,"look, i know the timing is bad."
8260,Gabrielle,you're welcome.
4206,Gabrielle,"oh, john."
5578,Gabrielle,are you nuts?!
7853,Gabrielle,"i am so sick of everybody looking at the glass half-full. the glass is empty, people, and so is our bank account."
4946,Gabrielle,i can't get it hot enough. my hormones are killing my taste buds..
8463,Gabrielle,"sure, you can, just not as many as me."
7414,Gabrielle,"wow. that's-- a really long time. but for better or worse, right?"
6321,Gabrielle,"okay,look, we have to do damage control. i get it. next session, i'll apologize to all the moms."
5232,Gabrielle,what?
7599,Gabrielle,and we're gonna make sure every woman in a 5-mile radius knows the kind of crap you pulled.
5929,Gabrielle,"i know.it's just you said, ""kill,"" not ""dead."" and i'd have to do be pretty angry to kill someone, so i guess my question is, do i have a reason to be angry at mr. solis?"
4614,Gabrielle,"hi, what are you doing here?"
8273,Gabrielle,"shut it, bitch."
4453,Gabrielle,"thank you, father crowley. you have been a tremendous comfort. um, i will let you do your thing."
7489,Gabrielle,"you and kathere did an amazing job. boy, we didn't think you guys could work together."
7784,Gabrielle,"you can dye that hair all you want, but the gray's just gonna keep coming."
4563,Gabrielle,bye.
5924,Gabrielle,"four months, and i've dressed like this for two of 'em. he's insatiable."
6126,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing? carlos! what are you doing?! carlos! you can't leave me out here in the middle of nowhere! ah! carlos!"
5380,Gabrielle,it's a joke. lighten up.
7954,Gabrielle,"yeah, too generous. it's like you're trying to buy us or something. well, we're not for sale, so just back off!"
6533,Gabrielle,"uh, yes, it is. you just vacuumed my tonsils. i deserve to know where that mouth has been."
6001,Gabrielle,"well, in that case, have some more fries."
5197,Gabrielle,"okay, skip it. i'm holding my marriage together by my fingernails. if carlos serves his full sentence, i don't think we're gonna make it. so please, i need you."
5509,Gabrielle,i gave these pictures to him as a gift.he owns them.
6701,Gabrielle,"i've known you for two weeks,and this is the first glimpse of a guy could actually like."
8508,Gabrielle,"anyway, i know you must be bored silly, so go ahead and make your escape."
5229,Gabrielle,"david, where are you going?"
7420,Gabrielle,i don't believe you.
6817,Gabrielle,me? you two owe me an apology.
6482,Gabrielle,"next time? honey, let's get real. you are way too young for me."
8107,Gabrielle,i can't believe you're leaving.
7129,Gabrielle,"but you could be, which brings me to my second point--men like variety. tonight you're a redhead. tomorrow--you are--helga, the sexy milkmaid. or--amber, the lonely runaway. or--jeff, the friendly guy from work. what? i don't know what tom is into."
7836,Gabrielle,it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
6846,Gabrielle,"well, well, well. who do we have here?"
5808,Gabrielle,"uh, well, hi, dale.nice to meet you.a lot of people have been looking for you."
7282,Gabrielle,victor!
6820,Gabrielle,"carlos, stop! put me down! what are you doing?!"
7230,Gabrielle,"victor, it's not that simple. we have major problems, and you never have time to talk about them, let alone fix 'em."
7321,Gabrielle,of course.
6456,Gabrielle,your boss?
5297,Gabrielle,"carlos, your hands."
5950,Gabrielle,are you done with my husband?
8226,Gabrielle,"okay, be honest. here i come. so what do you think?"
5817,Gabrielle,but it's not even his.
4590,Gabrielle,"you know honey, tonight's the last night of the boat show. we'll be able to spend some time together before that home and garden thing next week. carlos."
4159,Gabrielle,"well, yeah."
7769,Gabrielle,"or i could get the radiator fixed, which is gonna cost $300, which you are paying for."
6352,Gabrielle,i know what you mean.
8619,Gabrielle,"oh, fran, i'm so sorry. you didn't have any family to turn to? any friends?"
6157,Gabrielle,always happy to help a brother out. hold on.
5293,Gabrielle,"well, i'll tell you what, since it's my schedule that seems to be the problem, why don't i just figure out a time and call you?"
5001,Gabrielle,with our gay cable guy?
7823,Gabrielle,we were wrestling. wrestling.
8505,Gabrielle,there's some seeds in this. knock yourself out.
7721,Gabrielle,"she called us ""staff""?"
5737,Gabrielle,"well,you take care now."
5392,Gabrielle,she can wait five minutes. we're giving her a car.
6972,Gabrielle,"so what are you saying, i should marry victor because you're a withholding father?"
4173,Gabrielle,"if mary alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known. she lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes."
7835,Gabrielle,juanita! stop talking to your sister!
6319,Gabrielle,those damn tobacco companies!
6743,Gabrielle,we're having a good time. why risk ruining it?
7571,Gabrielle,you do what?
4415,Gabrielle,i love long good byes.
5654,Gabrielle,"so,um,we're auditioning to be parents?"
7544,Gabrielle,"you're right, ellie. my husband was totally inappropriate. so a class? are you a teacher?"
6081,Gabrielle,"no, i'm not going anywhere. in fact, i wanna meet the blushing bride."
7684,Gabrielle,"""we""?"
5195,Gabrielle,i don't know. tell him you're happily married or gay!
6652,Gabrielle,i don't know. he's just too arrogant. he acts like i'm some trophy he's already won. it's infuriating.
5372,Gabrielle,"so, she's hot! she's a hot nun!"
6987,Gabrielle,what?
5042,Gabrielle,damn straight. what you did was worse.
4393,Gabrielle,"it's me. don't turn around, my mother-in-law can see you."
6676,Gabrielle,you do not have to pay for my dress.
6670,Gabrielle,so?
8160,Gabrielle,"oh, i got it. i got it. go, go, go, go, go."
7545,Gabrielle,"no, it's gutsy. well, we like you, ellie, and if you have first and last months' rent, we'd like you even more."
4390,Gabrielle,"mama juanita, i'm going to the store. do you need anything?"
4882,Gabrielle,return the shoes? i can't talk to you when you're being hysterical.
5041,Gabrielle,"you knew the one thing i didn't want was a child, and you still tricked me into getting pregnant!"
4612,Gabrielle,why?
5129,Gabrielle,i don't think a conjugal visit is such a ridiculous request.
5130,Gabrielle,"but, i don't think i can wait that long."
7892,Gabrielle,"carlos, don't even think about saying no to this!"
4148,Gabrielle,let me see.
7041,Gabrielle,"uh, wait, but don't go! i-i need a little more guidance!"
7785,Gabrielle,you attacked my child and then me. why should i even listen to you?
8559,Gabrielle,i can't help it. i don't want people thinking i condone this face.
5545,Gabrielle,"who cares?father, it's me."
4334,Gabrielle,"no,no, i'll just be a minute."
6203,Gabrielle,really? it seems like yesterday to me.
7091,Gabrielle,i'll do it.
7052,Gabrielle,"oh, that's sweet. but to be honest, i don't like hospitals."
7771,Gabrielle,"damn it, andrew. you tell bree to call me by the end of the day."
8223,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, edie, it's a stupid exercise class. i tried it. it sucked. i don't want to do it anymore. lighten up."
8384,Gabrielle,i just wanted to see how your first day went. sit. take a load off. spill it.
7914,Gabrielle,"gosh, that's a--a hell of a sweet offer, but i've--got the girls, and, um--"
4556,Gabrielle,"uh, and it also has a lot of other exciting good, cool car things."
5485,Gabrielle,"no, not really.does it matter?"
6889,Gabrielle,"it was short notice, okay? these people are booked months in advance. the only people available were thones you just bailed on."
6858,Gabrielle,"hi, honey. you look handsome in a tux."
7949,Gabrielle,"well, she's not gonna leave her party to go buy a doll."
8414,Gabrielle,even if you're tired and get home late?
5387,Gabrielle,"i'm not here to talk you out of anything. check in this drawer. carlos, i wanna apologize for the way i've been acting. i mean, here you are trying to turn your life around, and all i can think about are my stupid jealousy issues."
4282,Gabrielle,oh! okay.
8125,Gabrielle,carlos? carlos!
5321,Gabrielle,uh-huh.
6801,Gabrielle,"it's awkward! it's--it's like if i donated a dress to charity, and i went to a party, and you showed up wearing it."
7900,Gabrielle,"why should i be jealous? the woman's, like, 60. if she gets off on carlos' magical touch, what do i care?"
5296,Gabrielle,"carlos, what happened?"
7176,Gabrielle,"really? because his father-in-law goes hunting with victor --you know, the guy who hired someone to tail us and possibly kill us?"
5651,Gabrielle,oh.
4895,Gabrielle,"no, i'm just pointing something out. i'm a pretty girl. and pretty girls are never lonely."
6177,Gabrielle,so it's a job contract?
6684,Gabrielle,"okay, let's be reasonable. you can't wear two dresses to one lunch. it's not like i have a spare in the car."
6009,Gabrielle,yeah. that's our wedding present to bree.
5974,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry, i'm just going to replay the look i had when i found out you hadn't banged him yet."
4386,Gabrielle,"this is what we'll do. i'll sell some old jewelry, pay off the credit card, and carlos will never find out!"
7829,Gabrielle,"hi, bethany. i'm here to pick up juanita. is she around?"
5764,Gabrielle,"oh,we just needed the one."
6461,Gabrielle,he says i know him and that he wants to reintroduce himself at dinner.
6289,Gabrielle,the divorce decree came through today. carlos is officially out of my life.
8657,Gabrielle,"""all right""? young lady, if you live under my roof, you will not disparage versace."
4982,Gabrielle,"yeah, we could do that."
5237,Gabrielle,you think david and i planned this so we could sleep together?
7898,Gabrielle,"paying him a fortune. but he's worth it. i mean, what he's done for that woman, no one else has been able to do."
8044,Gabrielle,"oh, i told you."
6900,Gabrielle,"well, we got chocolate and wine.your place or mine?"
5428,Gabrielle,what happened to sister greta?
4706,Gabrielle,"you know, carlos, i've been broke a lot of times in my life. but, i've never been poor, because poor is just a state of mind, and right now you and i are just--"
8582,Gabrielle,it is such a stunning piece. it's simple and elegant. don't you think?
4728,Gabrielle,"no, you don't understand. i don't want to go to anybody's house anymore. i'm tired of knocking on doors and making up excuses as to why we haven't fixed our plumbing."
6293,Gabrielle,"i'm here to teach fashion, so i'm fashionably late."
6460,Gabrielle,"yes, i-i may be in the top ten."
8007,Gabrielle,"hi, dr bach! how are you?"
5306,Gabrielle,"of course, i'm sad. it's a sad situation. now, let go of me."
7975,Gabrielle,"virginia, they're happy where they are. they love fairview. besides, greenbrier's, like, an hour away."
5736,Gabrielle,you think this is funny?
7149,Gabrielle,"playing with fire, almost getting burned but not quite."
5826,Gabrielle,"no, no,no, no, no, no!"
4392,Gabrielle,so who the hell is that?
8067,Gabrielle,"yeah, yeah. i'm comin'."
5503,Gabrielle,"baby,what you're about to see will most likely shock and upset you."
7762,Gabrielle,wh--will you at least have it washed?
5259,Gabrielle,because you just called me fat!
7565,Gabrielle,"oh, crap! abort! abort!"
8010,Gabrielle,"also, the surgery is very expensive. we need time to figure out how we're gonna pay for it."
7967,Gabrielle,"okay, girls, mommy's leaving. i love you!"
6379,Gabrielle,i'm so disappointed in her.
6087,Gabrielle,"sure, and i was married when we got together."
6471,Gabrielle,this is adorable! you think maybe i could
4340,Gabrielle,what did you do?
7573,Gabrielle,"okay, ellie, wait. you don't have to go."
5532,Gabrielle,knock it off.
5957,Gabrielle,"i don't know what that meant, but i didn't like the tone.so just remember, am the boss of you, or else i'm gonna make this the worst nine months of your life."
8009,Gabrielle,"okay, i didn't wanna have to say this, but you should never have surgery on a friday. the surgeons are thinking about the weekend. they're all distracted. next thing you know, you come out of the o.r. still blind and missing your right leg."
4579,Gabrielle,i worked ten hours today. i'll go by tomorrow. she doesn't even know when i'm there.
8558,Gabrielle,i'm not ill. i'm just not wearing any makeup so i can teach my daughter that beauty's what's on the inside. i don't actually look this hideous.
8073,Gabrielle,i'm now speaking for carlos. he'll take it.
7858,Gabrielle,i'm pregnant!
5572,Gabrielle,i wanna have a baby.i wanna have a baby with you.
5097,Gabrielle,"uh, our anniversary."
5575,Gabrielle,hello. what's going on?
6502,Gabrielle,"oh, zach. what are you doing here?"
4598,Gabrielle,"helen, uh, what are you doing here?"
5712,Gabrielle,you like jewelry?
7739,Gabrielle,thank you. mm-hmm.
6366,Gabrielle,sherri from class?
7095,Gabrielle,good point. mike! yes! let's get started.
7153,Gabrielle,what the hell is it?
7553,Gabrielle,"earlier tonight, i saw a guy coming out of ellie's room, so i assumed it was her boyfriend, but just now i caught her in there with another guy."
4857,Gabrielle,what?
7293,Gabrielle,"well, he took it pretty hard. oh, you don't think he did anything stupid, do you?"
6011,Gabrielle,things i'll do for jewelry.
7349,Gabrielle,aah! edie!
5602,Gabrielle,shut up.
4165,Gabrielle,what happened to him?
5552,Gabrielle,who was that?
5622,Gabrielle,"mother,no!"
8498,Gabrielle,"oh. well, this edna has got to be stopped."
7538,Gabrielle,"yeah, come on in. so because of my husband's disability, our financial situation has changed, and we have this big house."
4854,Gabrielle,if you want back in this bed you know what to do.
6051,Gabrielle,i feel so--
5598,Gabrielle,it's okay.glad you like it.you can brush my hair.
8212,Gabrielle,"oh, that sounds so yummy. you got any?"
5358,Gabrielle,wow. that biting thing at the end totally blew my mind. please tell me you didn't learn that in prison.
7404,Gabrielle,"boy, you are just determined to make this awkward, aren't ya?"
7529,Gabrielle,"i'm not sure. why don't i go look? huh. no. oh, wow. it's the scavo dog--way down in their yard. i guess it's true - lose one sense, all the others get heightened. okay, you get that. i'm gonna go find your dog."
8327,Gabrielle,i want to go home!
7606,Gabrielle,and--she's gone.
8206,Gabrielle,it's hard.
6871,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. she looks just like me when i was that age!"
5031,Gabrielle,"so you're just not gonna talk to me, is that it? fine. i don't need to talk. okay. yes, i had a little affair. it wasn't the best thing to do, and i'm not proud of it. but it's not the worst thing that could have happened. nobody died. oh, don't be such a martyr, carlos. okay, it takes two people. how many times did you go off on your little business trips and leave me alone? see, so technically, you cheated, too. it's just your mistress was your work."
5562,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!oh, my god! hold on!"
7198,Gabrielle,"six months? nobody takes that long to heal anymore. it's a breakup, not a face-lift."
8530,Gabrielle,hey.
5202,Gabrielle,"carlos, he's kidding. tell him you're kidding."
5468,Gabrielle,"damn it, lynette, if this has to do with that stupid kiss the other night,i'm gonna lose it!"
6985,Gabrielle,holy crap!
6208,Gabrielle,"yeah.yeah,i guess i am.why don't we just put all of this behind us and stay together?what do you say?"
5032,Gabrielle,"no, okay. that was a stretch. i'm sorry. carlos, wait! come back. look, i wanna start over. we're gonna have a baby. isn't that what you always wanted? carlos, wait! i said i was sorry and i love you! what more do you want?"
5787,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
7309,Gabrielle,carlos? that's crazy. where'd you hear that?
7720,Gabrielle,what? she's disinviting me?
5140,Gabrielle,"it couldn't hurt! ever since you've been in here, all we do is bicker!"
5792,Gabrielle,bree--i'm so sorry i'm late.
7696,Gabrielle,"honey, i know you wanna go home and watch your cartoons, but you had a lot of cake, so i was thinking i'd take you to the park. that way, you could run around and get some nice, fun exercise."
5096,Gabrielle,you know me.
8664,Gabrielle,"uh-huh, and how long do you think that will last?"
4633,Gabrielle,"yao lin? you missed a spot. no, spare me the lecture and just book me another job quick. carlos and i are up to our asses in bills and we can't pay them. fine. bye."
4131,Gabrielle,how do you think he'll react when we tell him?
4864,Gabrielle,"i'm unhappy. carlos and my marriage. i don't have options and it's driving me crazy. every time something went south in my life, i always had a plan b. now i feel like i have nothing."
5779,Gabrielle,"the baby won't stop crying, and i haven't slept for two days.will you please take lily for a while?"
5469,Gabrielle,lynette thinks i was hitting on you at bree's party.
6859,Gabrielle,"all right, look, i know you're mad, but wait till you hear what that jerk did to me--"
7722,Gabrielle,"no! it's not just one party! it's the kickoff to the whole social season. if people see we're off michelle's list, then we'll be off everyone's. and then it's gonna be the start of our slow slide from gowns and galas to flip-flops and keggers! okay, if carlos working at the club is the problem, then tell her he just quit."
4784,Gabrielle,"yeah! you did the crime, why should i have to pay the price? just suck it up, be a man, and do the time."
4807,Gabrielle,honey. it's not going to happen.
6693,Gabrielle,sorry. i wanted options. stop judging me. i was hopped up on couture.
7103,Gabrielle,"oh, here. let me get that."
8372,Gabrielle,it's been sitting on mccluskey's porch for years. i keep telling her how racist it is. first the candy bowl and now this? how many times have i told you not to steal?
4557,Gabrielle,tom! lynette! what are you doing here?
7610,Gabrielle,"hey! you don't even know her. okay, yes, she's made some bad choices, but deep down, she's a good person."
5155,Gabrielle,would those be the same instincts that picked out that cologne?
5630,Gabrielle,"here's how it's gonna work--you're gonna check yourself into the hotel,and then tomorrow,you're gonna plant your child bearing hips on a plane,and you're gonna leave our lives forever."
5939,Gabrielle,"no, no, you were good.just, if it comes up in school, paul revere was never president."
6402,Gabrielle,"oh, don't act innocent. you know you sent me these flowers."
5076,Gabrielle,you're right. that was weird.
7766,Gabrielle,"your car! i took it to a mechanic, who told me the radiator's shot."
8133,Gabrielle,"hey, you got an extra 15 minutes?"
7887,Gabrielle,what proposal?
8366,Gabrielle,"hey, are you still looking for a marketing director? i have a friend that i would love to see working with you two."
5316,Gabrielle,"yes. yes, i do. i need my space. thank you."
6512,Gabrielle,how can you be so sure zach's gonna go along with this?
7024,Gabrielle,"me,too."
4692,Gabrielle,then why did you?
7249,Gabrielle,"oh, that's right--those two boring hours i'll never get back."
6236,Gabrielle,if only you'd come ten minutes earlier.
7741,Gabrielle,what? i was just trying to salvage what's left of our social life. now just let it go and start thinking about where we're gonna move.
7617,Gabrielle,"okay, okay. we're going."
6602,Gabrielle,"look, zach, i'm glad you're here. i've been wanting to talk about us."
7645,Gabrielle,"mm--well, it would be easier if i knew what you knew."
7924,Gabrielle,"why not? i mean, look at this place. it's like shangri-la."
5793,Gabrielle,"ooh,i'll have a drink.anything with an umbrella."
6060,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry.it's just that i'm waiting for carlos' lawyer to call.spousal support has gotten ugly. hello.oh hi, tom!"
7197,Gabrielle,how long are we talking about?
6668,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! she wears my size! it's amazing. nobody wears my size."
8516,Gabrielle,"all right, look, tom, i'm sorry, but i got a responsibility here. i brought you into the club. i introduced you to the horny homemaker. i just don't want you to--"
6340,Gabrielle,i have no idea where you're going with this.
4305,Gabrielle,yeah.so?
5275,Gabrielle,"maybe, but i doubt it."
6185,Gabrielle,"yeah, we're drinking on the porch. you got a problem with that?"
7834,Gabrielle,"i'm not going back, carlos. i can't. if juanita doesn't get her playdate, you're not getting yours."
5006,Gabrielle,we're just gonna talk about non-crisis things.
7655,Gabrielle,savings? nobody does that anymore.
5500,Gabrielle,"uh,ralph,why are you telling me this?"
5417,Gabrielle,"she may wear a habit and the beads, but at the end of the day, she is still a woman, just like me, and i know what i'm capable of."
7337,Gabrielle,"carlos, if you are taking me somewhere where i don't need a boa, then i don't want to go. fine. you could be a little bit more sensitive. i had to say good-bye to my friends today."
7844,Gabrielle,"oh, wait! no, honey. why don't you wait till after the ceremony?"
5302,Gabrielle,do you like it? i picked it up on the way here.
7217,Gabrielle,which he did.
5719,Gabrielle,"you never gave a crap that we were mexican,did you?"
6172,Gabrielle,so you're not laying on anything in this house until you take a shower.
8436,Gabrielle,it's a 4-hour drive. we have to do something to pass the time.
8468,Gabrielle,what is?
6281,Gabrielle,"you know,just hours and hours of sitting around,looking pretty.but i think i'm done with modeling."
7079,Gabrielle,"oh, that's right. i was reading about that in politics is boring magazine."
5464,Gabrielle,hey!
7385,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetie, don't. i want you to remember al like i do-- at his desk, with a big smile on his face, surrounded by all his files. by the way, where are those files?"
5504,Gabrielle,"remember scott,the photographer i was dating when we met?the one i dumped for you,who never really got over it and who i always said was gonna get back at me?"
8255,Gabrielle,are you sure about that?
4852,Gabrielle,"well, you might want to try a motel, because you're not coming back in here."
6852,Gabrielle,"listen, buddy, you're not getting it. you answer to me now. i could have you fired."
6290,Gabrielle,i'm not doing it.
6610,Gabrielle,really? did he tell you that?
7933,Gabrielle,"the girls wanted to watch it, so we're kind of having a family movie night."
5790,Gabrielle,motherhood is such a blessing.i hope you get to experience it one day.
7578,Gabrielle,"no, seriously. we're getting along better. have you noticed that?"
7570,Gabrielle,look at it from my point of view. you're an attractive woman. guys are coming and going. i saw you take money from one of 'em. what am i supposed to think?
4763,Gabrielle,"well, it's awfully hard to like someone who actively hates your guts. she always thought you married beneath you and she let me know it."
7195,Gabrielle,you serious?
4445,Gabrielle,"father, i'm so glad you could come and pray for mama. please, sit, sit."
8138,Gabrielle,easy for you to say. they told me they love you more than me.
4856,Gabrielle,"well, then have fun at the motel."
5215,Gabrielle,he's just mowing the lawn like nothing ever happened. what should we do? should we call the police?
5475,Gabrielle,"you're enjoying this,aren't you?punishing me, dangling the affair over my head?well,i won't tolerate it."
5138,Gabrielle,he refused to help me get a conjugal visit.
8562,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so sweet. tell him no way in hell."
5445,Gabrielle,poor baby.i would've kissed you.
5612,Gabrielle,really?what did you buy?
4792,Gabrielle,i promise.
7692,Gabrielle,"oh, don't make me pull out the solis family photo album. it's like a bunch of sea lions posing on a rock."
6335,Gabrielle,we'll do it together. we'll be very diplomatic.
8553,Gabrielle,are you a lunatic? i am not walking into a ballroom full of people without my face on.
4584,Gabrielle,"oh, really?"
8587,Gabrielle,we just bought you a bed. it's not even a year old.
7512,Gabrielle,"well, if you ever want to bond with my boobs again, you'll get her off!"
4915,Gabrielle,"you couldn't wait to throw that in, could you? look, god is screwing with me! he doesn't like the way i live my life, so he's punishing me."
4639,Gabrielle,fine. please.
5858,Gabrielle,wait.are you a virgin?
5767,Gabrielle,"oh,honey,please.do i look like a masochist?first thing tomorrow,i'm hiring a nanny and a night nurse."
8628,Gabrielle,"the first time a man did something stupid, and a woman pointed it out."
5697,Gabrielle,yeah. my little girl's gonna inherit some wonderful genes.
4725,Gabrielle,"god, i have to go to the bathroom again."
7867,Gabrielle,i know. it's crazy. you had a vasectomy. it's impossible.
6680,Gabrielle,"yeah, couture."
6295,Gabrielle,yes! what am i supposed to do with that petting zoo out there?
7085,Gabrielle,"oh, so you're not engaged?"
4953,Gabrielle,alright. you win. wait right here.
8462,Gabrielle,"well, it's one more than you got."
6948,Gabrielle,what? and just go to the reception? you can't do that.
6463,Gabrielle,how about lunch?
7523,Gabrielle,"well, that's it. it's not a dog. we got him a seeing-- eye-- monkey. he's amazing. not only can he call 9-1-1, he can toast a bagel. bye."
8447,Gabrielle,"oh, i feel so sorry for all those other girls in the bar."
8236,Gabrielle,so this was his bonus? a salad and a stuffed chicken breast?
4398,Gabrielle,"hey, danielle."
7081,Gabrielle,were you widowed or divorced?
4912,Gabrielle,thank you.
6026,Gabrielle,who the hell are you anyway? and why the hell are you at this wedding?
7527,Gabrielle,where do you think i've been? there's no sign of her anywhere.
7951,Gabrielle,"you sure are making this hard. i have tried to be nice, but i am running out of polite here, so i'm just gonna say knock it off."
6938,Gabrielle,i just paid a makeup artist five hundred bucks to do my face. do you really think i wanna march down the aisle looking like i just ate a popsicle?
4377,Gabrielle,"i didn't realize how late it was. they're only holding the suede mini for me until two. if we stay, i'll never make it. we'll just have lunch at the mall."
4209,Gabrielle,i can't believe she wormed her way in. how did you let her do that?
8006,Gabrielle,huh. huh.
7889,Gabrielle,"$50,000?"
6398,Gabrielle,you didn't?
6041,Gabrielle,"lynette, listen to me. you and tom will survive this."
7315,Gabrielle,how is he?
8484,Gabrielle,"well, edie once told me she lost her virginity in cow pasture. if we can find that exact field--"
7659,Gabrielle,money? what money?
7358,Gabrielle,you really hate me?
6644,Gabrielle,"i have noticed, and i'm throwing you back."
8043,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. that's wonderful!"
8050,Gabrielle,"hey, this featherhead kept this family afloat for five years. you have no idea what i had to do to keep this roof over our heads."
7232,Gabrielle,you mean that?
4539,Gabrielle,"carlos, did you know what tanaka was doing?"
5243,Gabrielle,i thought this was what you wanted.
7941,Gabrielle,i--don't think that's such a good idea.
4782,Gabrielle,"this is too much. the only reason i agreed to give up the house is because i thought i was gonna get a gorgeous little apartment. now, i'm not even going to get that!"
8051,Gabrielle,i didn't sell your watch.
4156,Gabrielle,because i don't wanna wake up some morning with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.
6937,Gabrielle,are you out of your mind? i can't get married without my something new.
5110,Gabrielle,more than he knows.
5907,Gabrielle,i don't wanna go alone.it was your idea in the first place.
4660,Gabrielle,he was shot? how could you not tell us about this?
7469,Gabrielle,"carlos, i see handicapped people out and about all the time. in fact, i met two feisty men in wheelchairs yesterday at the mall. they were living their lives--so it's time for you to live yours. come on. come on."
6864,Gabrielle,"i was just joking around, being me. i thought you liked that."
4884,Gabrielle,ha ha. i don't know. i'd watch your back.
8205,Gabrielle,"you know, maybe i should give this a little gander."
7803,Gabrielle,i prefer cash.
6160,Gabrielle,i never said that.
4962,Gabrielle,stop it.
7800,Gabrielle,"give me my money, or next time we're trading paint."
5855,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei?i made you some hot cocoa.i guess the baby thing didn't really appeal to you,huh?i know it's a lot to ask,it's just,carlos and i think of you as family.don't you think of us as family?"
6330,Gabrielle,"amy, small steps. small! little miss snowflake glides. she doesn't stomp."
4929,Gabrielle,"oh, really?!"
6770,Gabrielle,"in fact, i was so overcome, that when we were trapped in the elevator, i seized the moment to express my joy."
5100,Gabrielle,"yeah, and husbands remember anniversaries, so i guess we're even."
7543,Gabrielle,that wasn't his biceps. why do you think he rushed out of here?
7551,Gabrielle,"oh, you know what? it can wait. i'll see you in the morning."
5222,Gabrielle,oh.
6653,Gabrielle,"oh, stop it. you cannot be that hard up."
7980,Gabrielle,"sorry about the tip, but i just lost $50 million."
5981,Gabrielle,"it was banter!i mean, has this country come to the point where you can't joke with the help?"
7102,Gabrielle,"tom, watch it!"
5989,Gabrielle,here you go.
5851,Gabrielle,"oh,well,it would be our baby.it would just be growing inside of you."
4234,Gabrielle,"you did. well, let's see what you've learned."
5656,Gabrielle,"oh,here's one we took on vacation."
4954,Gabrielle,don't get out.
7702,Gabrielle,"18 to zero! 2 more points, and you'll break the record."
6544,Gabrielle,"a ""friend"" friend,not a girlfriend."
7704,Gabrielle,"looks like mommy's gonna score her first 2 points. come on, juanita. show mommy what a winner you are. juanita! what are you doing?! juanita, stop! juanita! juanita!"
6076,Gabrielle,what?
7996,Gabrielle,"really? i mean, do you think i could pull this off?"
7871,Gabrielle,"well, i'm gonna find out."
7677,Gabrielle,my vera wang?!
4759,Gabrielle,don't you think that's a little over the top?
6916,Gabrielle,wanted to bite my tongue the minute it came out.
5893,Gabrielle,ow! stop kicking me.
5623,Gabrielle,"off the top of my head,you're on medicare?"
5541,Gabrielle,excuse me?
7718,Gabrielle,bree! what's up?
6728,Gabrielle,look. no gloves.
5910,Gabrielle,that is so true.
8636,Gabrielle,fine. ok.
5838,Gabrielle,"i don't think i could go through that pain again.i did freeze some of my eggs,so we might do the surrogacy thing,but i don't know."
7239,Gabrielle,oh!
6248,Gabrielle,"i think you mean vogue, sweetie."
7660,Gabrielle,what's wrong with my voice?
6566,Gabrielle,no.
4713,Gabrielle,i can't hear you!
7893,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry about mr. banks. i'll take care of him."
7304,Gabrielle,"oh, i think you'll find this has a real kick."
7650,Gabrielle,"teddy bear? what is that, code for ""a pound of blow""?"
5441,Gabrielle,"so i finally said,if i'm head cheerleader,then nobody wears panties."
5035,Gabrielle,paternity test results? i know. i'm in the same situation.
5702,Gabrielle,why?
7623,Gabrielle,he's so precious.
6523,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm stuffed. i can't believe you talked me into that crme brle."
7265,Gabrielle,"no, he's mad, but he wasn't dead."
7032,Gabrielle,one second!
8052,Gabrielle,right. damn.
8544,Gabrielle,now march in there and wipe that stuff off!
5104,Gabrielle,"a woman does need to be loved, and since you didn't give it to me, i had to find it elsewhere."
5943,Gabrielle,"because carlos doesn't have an adulterous bone in his body.what we just did he could never do.for him, sex isn't just sex. it's a sign of intimacy.it's the way he shows love.you know, instead of talking and listening and spending time with me. what was that for?"
5555,Gabrielle,"oh, well, maybe you should go lie down.i'm gonna be out for a while."
5255,Gabrielle,"luckily, the judge dropped the hate crime charge. so now all carlos has to do is serve out the slave labor thing. he'll be out in six months."
7866,Gabrielle,got a lot on my mind. i think i'm pregnant.
7448,Gabrielle,it's a black-tie fund-raiser that bree organizes every year.
6309,Gabrielle,"honestly, it was like any other job, except the pay was great, the clothes were couture, and the parties were just this side of gomorrah. you don't know what gomorrah means, do you? good."
6918,Gabrielle,so we're kind stuck.
6599,Gabrielle,"well, we were both half-naked, and there was a condom wrapper. and he said i was amazing, which totally sounds like me. he thinks we're a couple now. you have to help me."
4769,Gabrielle,"yes, did she die quietly in her sleep?"
5216,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, susan's home."
6947,Gabrielle,"which is why i have to show people that i'm okay with it. please, just consider it my wedding gift."
6739,Gabrielle,you have no idea.
4931,Gabrielle,you can still see the glue marks!
4413,Gabrielle,it's not those kind of cramps.
4370,Gabrielle,"no, lynette, i'm sorry, juanita's taking a bath. well, how much did she win from you? jeez,"" ""yeah, i guess she'll take a check. okay. all right. bye."
8621,Gabrielle,"well, no, but--"
5007,Gabrielle,"i'm here to testify for you, carlos. can you take those off?"
7763,Gabrielle,damn you.
7777,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, let's face it. m.j. could get beaten up by a kitten."
5917,Gabrielle,"well, carlos, they had your name."
6163,Gabrielle,"oh,i have to,carlos.i need you to give up on us.we're not good for each other,and i can't keep doing this."
5288,Gabrielle,aah!
5625,Gabrielle,"carlos,you are not seriously considering this."
5254,Gabrielle,i know i haven't been to the store lately but i've been a little busy getting my husband out of jail.
7642,Gabrielle,"no way, bree. i don't want katherine in our games. she bums me out."
7356,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry carlos and i lied to you. i know we hurt you, and i wish it didn't happen the way it did, and i-i just want you to know that."
6175,Gabrielle,"i don't want to, but if you wear them one more time, they're gonna ask me themselves."
5361,Gabrielle,who is sister mary bernard?
5494,Gabrielle,betty! matthew.
4956,Gabrielle,yeah. you see pregnant women have very strong urges.
5835,Gabrielle,"no,you can't go!you can't--you can't take her!you can't take her! no!she's our baby!she's our--no!please!"
6351,Gabrielle,how was it?
7745,Gabrielle,are you serious?
6854,Gabrielle,free parking!
6809,Gabrielle,"don't even get me started about what i've done for you, okay? i'm still boycotting madame kim's day spa because of your botched bikini wax."
5465,Gabrielle,"well, i saw that tom was overwhelmed,so i thought i'd give him a hand."
6826,Gabrielle,"yes, deeply."
5040,Gabrielle,"what, you want a father's day card?"
5116,Gabrielle,you're supposed to be in love with me.
6258,Gabrielle,"that's great! well, i have some fun news of my own. i'm ready to model again."
7878,Gabrielle,i don't know. but you would have if i hadn't started my period. how could you have done this?
4752,Gabrielle,but i thought you said they offered a plea bargain.
7789,Gabrielle,"susan, it's not your fault."
6494,Gabrielle,i can't believe you followed me.
7029,Gabrielle,"yeah. unfortunately, it's my sweat. when are you gonna dump her?"
5558,Gabrielle,"me? oh, i'm just a humble sinner.you're the one with all the power around here--all the-- annulment mojo."
8266,Gabrielle,"do you hear that, carlos? godparents."
8380,Gabrielle,because it's a great opportunity.
7436,Gabrielle,"good. to avoid future confusion, i love you, and i want to spend the rest of my life with you."
5276,Gabrielle,ah. how do i look?
4322,Gabrielle,tomorrow. meet me at the front entrance of the mall after school.
8521,Gabrielle,"and by ""do something,"" he means having me slave over a rack of lamb all day."
5126,Gabrielle,"um, i've been thinking, you know, about, um, everything that happened with john, and, and, um, i was really selfish and stupid. and i'm sorry. i really am sorry. that's all i had to say, really."
6048,Gabrielle,"excuse me, you screw up our lives and the best you can do is, 'that's the way the cookie crumbles?' and who is this guy? why is he writing down everything i say?"
4459,Gabrielle,"oh, i know i shouldn't complain. it's just there's something missing, and i don't know what it is. do you ever feel that way?"
6625,Gabrielle,"well, hang in there as long as you can, 'cause i still need you."
6649,Gabrielle,"been there, done that."
5164,Gabrielle,"yes, we got it. uh, we interrupt our lovemaking to answer the phone or you call out the dogs."
6455,Gabrielle,this jerk has been terrorizing me. he broke into my house!
8494,Gabrielle,that's a bit that i never get tired of.
8024,Gabrielle,that's it?
5607,Gabrielle,"oh.hi,mom."
4281,Gabrielle,imagine what you would lose if carlos finds out you're trimming more than the hedges.why are all your friends staring at me? did you tell them about us?
7305,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't know, but if you're not feeling well, maybe we should put this off."
7115,Gabrielle,"look, i know you're upset."
7179,Gabrielle,what about your wife?
4279,Gabrielle,"it's okay. it was a close call, but i managed to cover. i got you these, so from now on, we can't let carlos see you around the house wearing anything that resembles a gym sock."
4410,Gabrielle,i don't want us to end on a bad note. carlos has this black tie thing tonight. i could slip--
5093,Gabrielle,"careful, carlos, you're not in a position to argue."
8533,Gabrielle,"no. i get it. when we first moved here, carlos was working round the clock, and he'd come home and barely say hello to me."
6719,Gabrielle,"no, i'm serious. our mothers had the right idea. they let men think they were the only ones who needed sex, and women just went along as a favor. men begged for every crumb, and we never lost the upper hand."
5002,Gabrielle,hello?
8314,Gabrielle,"well, i'm tired of the deal, and what you're doing to maria is despicable."
6425,Gabrielle,it's okay. i'm probably not ready to date.
8313,Gabrielle,"yeah, she's a real gem."
4896,Gabrielle,we made a deal. no kids.
5670,Gabrielle,"okay,first of all,it was statutory,and it happened so long ago."
7860,Gabrielle,"oh, gaby, why do i need to wear a condom? there's no way lightning's gonna strike twice."
6861,Gabrielle,that explains it.
8595,Gabrielle,"well, i want juanita to work with the poor. i want to teach her to be grateful for how good she has it."
5789,Gabrielle,"hi. hi,pretty girl.oh,yes,mommy has to go.mommy has to go,so she can stay pretty and thin and you can be proud of her."
6581,Gabrielle,"ohhh, zach!"
8622,Gabrielle,we're going to a family reunion at aunt connie' and i want to look my best.
8179,Gabrielle,eli would have said that's more than most people get.
8330,Gabrielle,"oh, hi."
5188,Gabrielle,"by the way, he was wearing a suit. how do you know he had a good body?"
4406,Gabrielle,bree--
7598,Gabrielle,you were only doing it because you're the devil.
5636,Gabrielle,it wouldn't have done any good.
7468,Gabrielle,come on. you've been cooped up in this house since you got home from the hospital. let's go out and have some fun!
5621,Gabrielle,so?
4839,Gabrielle,"well, that was risky, i mean the feds are watching you right now."
4263,Gabrielle,relax! carlos is at work and he doesn't ring the doorbell.
7151,Gabrielle,and i was married when we got together.
8042,Gabrielle,what?
7064,Gabrielle,you promise? 'cause if i did--then--god! i'm such a mess.
4548,Gabrielle,i'm still searching.
5976,Gabrielle,hey!quick question.have you by any chance seen xiao mei?
4509,Gabrielle,i think--
8593,Gabrielle,"okay, you know what? this conversation is over. go to your room! you, too, bobblehead."
4353,Gabrielle,did you find out where zach is?
5753,Gabrielle,no.i'm not giving up the baby.
5703,Gabrielle,"what?! why,i--that's discrimination.it's illegal.we could have her arrested."
8634,Gabrielle,"no, it's not just you."
6643,Gabrielle,"it was okay. you know, you told a few good jokes. you're sorta charming. you're not bad-looking. i just think i can do better."
6677,Gabrielle,"trust me, it was a steal. i'm gonna go powder my nose, and then you can start showing me off."
8306,Gabrielle,"i'm a friend of maria's, who, by the way, happens to be a warm and lovely person."
5701,Gabrielle,what is it?
7524,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, i'm afraid i have some bad news."
6234,Gabrielle,"carlos, have you lost your mind?!"
4375,Gabrielle,"she has a major weakness. honey, oh,"" ""it's okay. you were right to tell me this."
7398,Gabrielle,why?
4145,Gabrielle,john. we have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.
4546,Gabrielle,"i'm just so angry with carlos. what was he thinking, exporting goods made from slave labor? why couldn't he have embezzled like other white collar criminals?"
5765,Gabrielle,it was my grandmother's name.
4499,Gabrielle,"susan, i feel awful about what happened. susan, talk to me!"
4399,Gabrielle,"oh, danielle, remember when you said you wanted to be a model?"
6891,Gabrielle,"all right, ten thousand. i'm not gonna haggle."
8208,Gabrielle,okay. we need to talk.
4820,Gabrielle,"no, i know what a post-nup is, what is it doing on my coffee table?"
7855,Gabrielle,"well, i guess that's not the worst idea you've ever had. but it's not just about the money, carlos. it's-- oh, after my miscarriage, i gave up on this dream. i just figured god decided i couldn't possibly be a good mom, so he didn't make it happen."
6225,Gabrielle,how dare you! that is a vicious lie.
8441,Gabrielle,maybe it's a sign we're not supposed to do this today.
4602,Gabrielle,"well, why, uh, why would he do that?"
4422,Gabrielle,don't say that! we need to stay positive.
8355,Gabrielle,i don't care! why couldn't you have told me this before she's about to appear on my doorstep?
6539,Gabrielle,so stop doing it. stop buying people.
7944,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa. we're not going to europe with grandma nutjob."
4368,Gabrielle,now give me a boost.
6316,Gabrielle,"vern, what are you doing here?"
4729,Gabrielle,because it's your fault.
7450,Gabrielle,it'll start with hair pull and end with detectives taking our statements. remember the pie thing?
6342,Gabrielle,"of course not, bill. can i call you bill? it's just we feel that amy would benefit from some private coaching. maybe i could come to your house? say, friday, five o'clock?"
8534,Gabrielle,it was like i was invisible.
7341,Gabrielle,"edie, you thief! open this door now!"
7491,Gabrielle,"if it for anyone but you, it wouldn't be worth it."
7863,Gabrielle,"oh, cram it, you fertile freak. you're getting a vasectomy."
5114,Gabrielle,joan? you're calling her joan?
6538,Gabrielle,"forget about it.give a horny kid a couple million bucks and the yellow pages,and stuff is gonna happen."
8001,Gabrielle,see? delicious!
6600,Gabrielle,where are you going?
7947,Gabrielle,"virginia! what, uh, are you doing here?"
5423,Gabrielle,"i bet she did. how much cash are you short, father?"
6407,Gabrielle,anything for a good cause.
7297,Gabrielle,great.
5710,Gabrielle,please. do i look middle class to you?
5834,Gabrielle,"carlos, do something!"
8054,Gabrielle,there.
5118,Gabrielle,so were you lying to me? were you just trying to get me into bed?
7819,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, you were right. blind sex is incredible."
4254,Gabrielle,oh he used to have a thing for spiked heels.
4817,Gabrielle,and when you get out we're going to have money to start over with. thanks to me.
4722,Gabrielle,ahem. sorry.
6120,Gabrielle,get your hands off me! police brutality!
5493,Gabrielle,"bree,maybe you should call in a favor from your police detective pal,have him poke around."
5639,Gabrielle,"i'm getting her luggage back to her,and that's the best i can do."
5058,Gabrielle,really? how?
5071,Gabrielle,"oh, don't even think about it."
5771,Gabrielle,put down the burrito.what is all this crap about me not getting help?
6000,Gabrielle,you know what the doctor said. you should see his cholesterol. this man bleeds bacon grease.
8154,Gabrielle,"so i said, ""pumpkin""-- that's what i call jon bon jovi-- i said, ""pumpkin, even if i could steer a yacht, i'm certainly not about to do it in 5-inch heels."" true story."
8021,Gabrielle,"mmm, i remember that place."
8129,Gabrielle,fine.
6458,Gabrielle,"look, i know you're trying to be romantic, but if you keep this up, i'm gonna be forced--"
4373,Gabrielle,was this before we were married?
7440,Gabrielle,"and in a surprise move, the spurs announced a trade that will send perennial all-star to the--"
6005,Gabrielle,your mama's pearls? carlos! thank you.
6372,Gabrielle,"well, i thought you two were practically sisters."
4871,Gabrielle,you mow lawns!
4753,Gabrielle,put me down.
7370,Gabrielle,"well, they should give you something for the pain."
5069,Gabrielle,"i'm, uh, i'm gabrielle solis. our, our husbands are roommates at the prison."
8040,Gabrielle,"yeah, you know what? i'm gonna have to call a big, fat per nulla on that one."
8638,Gabrielle,"well, let her wait. i need something to drink. trying to keep down one of hers world-famous tamales."
5295,Gabrielle,"yeah, you know, i would, but the store has this strict thirty-day return policy."
7300,Gabrielle,"okay, if we just stay lm and stick to the story--"
7453,Gabrielle,this place is huge! would it kill them to have valet parking?
5937,Gabrielle,you were a virgin?
5879,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. okay. sorry."
4570,Gabrielle,tell me what?
7879,Gabrielle,we can't handle another kid. we're living hand to mouth as it is.
6046,Gabrielle,i forgive you. it's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
4772,Gabrielle,thank you so much. that's all i needed to hear.
4192,Gabrielle,"yeah, right."
5335,Gabrielle,what am i supposed to think? you lie about protecting me and then you lock me in that heap without door handles so i can't get out.
8643,Gabrielle,"well, luckily, it's a big family. let her go live with nina and luis."
6431,Gabrielle,"i mean, you saw me. i went on a picnic and ate pudding out of a can. it was horrible."
7044,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. have you been there this whole time?"
8547,Gabrielle,"he's right, sweetie. you don't need all that gunk on your face."
6645,Gabrielle,"you can chase me all you want, but trust me, i'm way too fast for you."
4214,Gabrielle,"yes, i am having some new bushes planted outside, and he gave me that as a colour palette."
5743,Gabrielle,we were supposed to have four weeks.she promised me the baby wasn't due for four more weeks.
5454,Gabrielle,nothing.
4441,Gabrielle,what?
4529,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. no! some of this stuff is mine. when i modeled. before i even met carlos! see this, costa boda, bought it when i landed my first cover. this, i spent eight hours on a rock in a bikini for that painting!"
7443,Gabrielle,of course not. i use a spoon.
4179,Gabrielle,"i'll find them, just get out!"
8367,Gabrielle,"yeah, no problem. two eggs coming right up. wait. i made omelets this morning, so i'm all out."
4194,Gabrielle,stop.
7983,Gabrielle,crap!
6302,Gabrielle,"have you guys ever seen a runway model without the hot clothes and makeup? well, trust me, they're not that special, but the one thing that they do have is attitude. you have to believe in yourself, and if not, pretend to believe in yourself, okay?"
7329,Gabrielle,"yeah, and seeing how he's the rich mayor of a small town with various thugs and cops at his disposal, carlos and i thought it would be safer if we got the heck out of dodge."
4246,Gabrielle,"sure, one of these days."
7737,Gabrielle,right.
7010,Gabrielle,he's a cutie.what does he do?
8096,Gabrielle,"carlos, be nice."
5863,Gabrielle,"and,uh,give xiao-mei a kick in the pants.i haven't seen her all morning."
7542,Gabrielle,you're as blind as a fruit bat. how would you know if he's a bodybuilder?
6574,Gabrielle,is that your office?
7332,Gabrielle,"i know. this is-- a lousy way to say good-bye. and i'm sorry, but i don't have a choice. do you guys have any idea how much i'm gonna miss you?"
6842,Gabrielle,what do you mean?
5724,Gabrielle,"look,we spent a lot of money on that.the least you can do is open it so we can bask in your happy expression."
4174,Gabrielle,"every time i'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass!"
7707,Gabrielle,"no, carlos. i mean--sometimes i'm glad you can't see me. five years and two kids and no time for facials or the gym. it just-- takes a toll. and when edie same the other day, it was like she didn't even recognize me."
6023,Gabrielle,"no, i'll drive."
7130,Gabrielle,what are you doing here?
5182,Gabrielle,i don't know. i hired a brilliant lawyer to get my husband out of this hellhole and he fired him. for no reason at all.
7778,Gabrielle,yeah? or maybe you could teach your son to grow a pair!
8108,Gabrielle,"carlos, what is going on? you're gonna miss your plane."
6305,Gabrielle,"well, you guys earned it. but eat fast, because we only have one hour left, and i want to introduce you to your new best friend, mr. spray tan."
6239,Gabrielle,you know what the weird part is?
8239,Gabrielle,"you give it to me, and then call your insurance and say it was stolen? i didn't think so."
6447,Gabrielle,all right. don't take the big one. that's my favorite.
8671,Gabrielle,all right.
5921,Gabrielle,"well, i am gabrielle solis."
5999,Gabrielle,stop eating my fries!
8202,Gabrielle,"hey, i know some of those women in your exercise class. the most exercise they ever get is cutting a piece of cake."
6016,Gabrielle,yeah.
7251,Gabrielle,knows what?
5680,Gabrielle,"carlos, come on!they're here!"
4995,Gabrielle,with our gay cable guy?
6558,Gabrielle,"works for me, too."
6978,Gabrielle,mrs. mccluskey! enjoy the wedding?
6732,Gabrielle,taking my piece.
4610,Gabrielle,"oh, no. john. i, uh, i didn't come here for that."
5618,Gabrielle,what does it matter whose dna it is?the diapers are still gonna smell the same regardless.
4534,Gabrielle,we're not into clutter.
4562,Gabrielle,"oh, uh, you know, i wanted to match the shoes to the dress. this is, uh, sarah, my shopping buddy. we like to hit the boutiques together."
7327,Gabrielle,oh. right. it's nice.
5980,Gabrielle,i may have mentioned deportation but i didn't think she'd take it personally.
5249,Gabrielle,"fine, i'm pregnant. whee! now come on, we are supposed to be cheering up susan. this is a time of crisis and i think you need another scoop of mint chocolate chip."
4544,Gabrielle,"i'm running out of money. in a couple of weeks, i'm gonna be screwed."
7263,Gabrielle,"well, i-i clubbed him and knocked him overboard."
6138,Gabrielle,"well, i think it's more than that. i think you really hate me."
5260,Gabrielle,but i'm only three months pregnant. women don't show at three months.
5159,Gabrielle,"i'm not stuck, mr. bradley. believe it or not, i love my husband."
7883,Gabrielle,"i'm about to go get groceries. where are your tips? oh, my god! how did you get so much?"
4810,Gabrielle,"oh, have we met?"
7880,Gabrielle,of course i can't. it's just--how could you have lied to me?
7675,Gabrielle,"okay, my friends are gone. i'm ready to fix you dinner. what the hell are you doing?!"
4273,Gabrielle,"no, she dusts with them."
4702,Gabrielle,definitely gay.
7368,Gabrielle,go to hell.
7496,Gabrielle,"i get that, but surely she's trained to do other stuff, you know, like find his keys or turn off the radio or lick up his spills."
5317,Gabrielle,you said you were leaving.
7131,Gabrielle,can't you just call me?
6186,Gabrielle,show-offs.
8676,Gabrielle,"and the teenager has finally arrived. ana, listen. we want you to be part of this family. we will love you and support you and take care of you, but in exchange, you will show us a little bit of respect and obey our rules, which means doing your own chores, no boys in the house and no more gifts from men."
7709,Gabrielle,"carlos, we got invited to michelle downing's party! i'm gonna have to buy something nice to--aah!"
5483,Gabrielle,"oh, whatever,close enough."
6725,Gabrielle,"i've been taken for granted before, and i'm not gonna let it happen again. if i'm gonna give myself to you, you damn well better worship me!"
6930,Gabrielle,"me, too. i think it would've been so much fun."
5176,Gabrielle,"oh, david."
4909,Gabrielle,"well, not this one. 'cos i vomited in this one."
7113,Gabrielle,"look, it was a long time ago, and--and it didn't mean anything."
4664,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. do i know you?
5219,Gabrielle,"why don't you ask mike? he overheard everything, right?"
6582,Gabrielle,you did not see the look on his face when i tried to kiss him. it's like he was sniffing expired milk.
4682,Gabrielle,"no, that means i'm all alone. you're leaving."
4601,Gabrielle,"oh, okay."
5394,Gabrielle,"sorry. he's such an animal but since we have a couple of minutes, why don't we, uh, chat?"
8106,Gabrielle,"absolutely. come here, you!"
7938,Gabrielle,"you're both stupid. stop it! um, mrs. hildebrand, this is really nice of you. but why would you want to ruin your beautiful room?"
7322,Gabrielle,but you're okay now. that's the important thing.
5956,Gabrielle,"you're not going anywhere, not as long as you have my baby in your belly."
6678,Gabrielle,hey.
7439,Gabrielle,sure.
4347,Gabrielle,i supervise.
7283,Gabrielle,"carlos, why are you calling me? i told you we can't be seen together."
5799,Gabrielle,"oh,thank god!oh,honey,i'm so sorry.i'm never gonna leave you again. oh!yes. yes."
7495,Gabrielle,"okay, hypothetical situation - carlos and i are sitting on the couch. i'm doing my nails. he's whining for the remote. how do i get roxy to fetch it for him?"
6905,Gabrielle,"and getting married is scary, but at least we'll be doing it together. oh, my god! we should totally do that!"
7948,Gabrielle,"well, she's a little busy with her friends right now, so just give it to me, and i'll make sure she gets it."
4737,Gabrielle,"thank you so much, bree. seeing your tile has really helped me make my decision. next time i remodel, i am using limestone."
7140,Gabrielle,"it's a blend of 36 essential oils, anise root and fennel. do you like it?"
6946,Gabrielle,"look, everyone knows you're living with edie. if she shows up alone, people will think i asked her not to bring you, like it bugs me that you guys are together."
4527,Gabrielle,how am i supposed to live without a car?
4237,Gabrielle,"oh, oh, no problem. nice to meet you, ashley."
4184,Gabrielle,john?
5476,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna let you even the score.carlos,go have an affair."
6796,Gabrielle,"i've been doing some thinking, and you know how--how do i put this? you know how you feel like sometimes people hate you?"
4191,Gabrielle,"i'm not in the mood. but, we could stay up and talk."
5809,Gabrielle,"well, it's a good thing he's here.we can take him to the lawyer's office,and you can sign over full custody to us. okay."
5948,Gabrielle,"so, wait, you're gonna get down on one knee, pop the question, and while you're down there, dig in his pocket?"
5632,Gabrielle,"okay,first of all,no one asked you.and the only reason you care about my mother is because of that ridiculous suggestion she offered."
4412,Gabrielle,of course!
4978,Gabrielle,"well, if you saw what he did to our pogonias you'd slap him too."
6941,Gabrielle,holy crap!
7209,Gabrielle,hold on. this check is dated for next year.
5769,Gabrielle,"no,it's okay.i'll win this battle later."
7461,Gabrielle,"you know, the quicker i can run my errands, the faster i can get home to my husband, who needs me, because that's the kind of person i am. w-what are you doing?"
7369,Gabrielle,hey. how you feeling?
6707,Gabrielle,your speech--i liked it.
5918,Gabrielle,oh!why is your back all sweaty?
4476,Gabrielle,so word on the street is you and danielle might break up.
8338,Gabrielle,s-so what kind of kiss are we talking about?
8507,Gabrielle,"first of all, you're a real prince for coming today. thanks to you, our coup is complete."
5267,Gabrielle,"bree, it's still too easy to breathe. you've gotta make it tighter."
6164,Gabrielle,you know what? i'm tired. can we talk about this in the morning?
7961,Gabrielle,delightful. now leave before there's a terrible misunderstanding between my foot and your ass.
7850,Gabrielle,i don't care. you told me this couldn't happen. you said it was impossible!
6154,Gabrielle,"yes, you saw my boobs, and you're gonna have that mental snapshot to use as you wish for the rest of your life, but that is all you're getting!"
6559,Gabrielle,zach!
4555,Gabrielle,"it, uh, it has an excellently crafted interior, peaceful quiet tuning, and ultrasonic rear parking assist. observe the remote activation feature."
5479,Gabrielle,"no, i'm pragmatic.because once you finish your fling,we'll be equals again.and then you won't be able to judge me.and we can go back to being a boring, average married couple.oh, just do me a favor. don't bring back any diseases."
8537,Gabrielle,"well, for the record, you're growing on me. you know what? i'm thirsty. let's start a book club."
6688,Gabrielle,so what kind of orange is this shirt? like a salmon or a coral?
6341,Gabrielle,vern! he is so competitive. i constantly have to remind him they're just kids. when did you lose the joy?
5695,Gabrielle,"oh, it's actually pronounced solis."
6908,Gabrielle,"yeah, and then you wouldn't be mad at me for the date, and i wouldn't feel guilty. and we could be brides--"
6359,Gabrielle,this will blow over.
4618,Gabrielle,i'll talk to john tomorrow and give back the ring.
8086,Gabrielle,was it lou?
6121,Gabrielle,don't talk to me.
4180,Gabrielle,out the window.
5203,Gabrielle,"honey. i am so sorry. honestly, that guy's insane!"
7410,Gabrielle,"i don't know. just after everything we've been through, there's nothing in our way now. we can finally be together. and i really need that. i need a happy ending, carlos. so what do you say? will you marry me?"
8267,Gabrielle,how could we say no?
7199,Gabrielle,"yeah. i do. you're such a good guy, carlos. i really hate that about you."
5061,Gabrielle,why would he think you have that kind of money?
5353,Gabrielle,what?
4775,Gabrielle,being poor? a little.
6019,Gabrielle,"guest, carlos. i said guest."
4832,Gabrielle,"so sophie, susan said you're going to the spa tomorrow. is that an all day thing?"
4801,Gabrielle,"mr. hartley, i have a hypothetical question for you. i like to play the lottery and i - yes, i know what the odds are, but i just love those scratch-offs. say i were to win, i don't know, a million six hundred thousand dollars. would the government be able to take it? like they took everything else?"
5633,Gabrielle,generous?don't you see the strings attached?
8388,Gabrielle,what do you mean by affectionate?
4300,Gabrielle,"hey! i'm not going to stop my life just because she decides to show up. unannounced, i might add."
7181,Gabrielle,"i-i wasn't ""trapped."""
5027,Gabrielle,you don't know it's your baby. i don't even know it's your baby. and i don't wanna know 'cause it doesn't matter!
5692,Gabrielle,"wow, that--that sounds like interesting work."
5923,Gabrielle,"honey, uh, i think it's time to unpack the pants."
8374,Gabrielle,that's it. party's over!
5742,Gabrielle,what?
5158,Gabrielle,i'd say i'm pregnant!
7172,Gabrielle,just an old friend and his idiot wife. come on. let's go.
5830,Gabrielle,"carlos!no!carlos, what's happening?"
4549,Gabrielle,"of course. i made ten thousand dollars a day. i don't expect to, to make that here."
8485,Gabrielle,i don't think edie would want us to get all sappy.
5810,Gabrielle,you're trying to take our baby!how is it not gonna be ugly?
4893,Gabrielle,"i don't need your credit cards, carlos. and i don't need your money. but if our marriage is going to work, i need your respect."
7546,Gabrielle,"oh, no, i love cash. cash and i go way back. so are you okay with this, or do you need to grope her, too?"
4524,Gabrielle,huh? that's my car! oh my god!
6039,Gabrielle,lynette! carlos will never be fair game! you know the rules!
7987,Gabrielle,that's it? no concussion?
4306,Gabrielle,what's your point?
7485,Gabrielle,you're welcome.
7907,Gabrielle,"fine. when the cops bust up this brothel, i'm gonna tell them you're the madame."
6699,Gabrielle,i'd love to. although what am i gonna wear now?
6142,Gabrielle,"really? well, that's weird. when?"
4502,Gabrielle,"i do love him! i do! it's just complicated! you know, there's, there's got to be another way to fix this."
4996,Gabrielle,"well, you sort of are."
4132,Gabrielle,ralph has a little crush.so?
6365,Gabrielle,what?
7060,Gabrielle,you think i don't care?
7116,Gabrielle,"victor, really, i don't think it's a big deal."
6219,Gabrielle,"oh, hon, again?"
7269,Gabrielle,here. sit him here.
8369,Gabrielle,"unbelievable. juanita, get your butt down here."
5161,Gabrielle,like you said. i want what i want when i want it.
6964,Gabrielle,"oh, so i don't even get a vote?"
6881,Gabrielle,"well, you canceled, and victor was kind of in a rush because he didn't think it'd look good for the mayor to be shacking up. and every day we tried, someone had a conflict. and then your date opened up, and we knew all my friends were available, and, well--you know, you, too."
5444,Gabrielle,18?
8642,Gabrielle,"what's there to talk about? you won't even let the girls get a golden retriever, and now you wanna take in a teenager?"
6986,Gabrielle,"trust me,victor.this will be a night you'll never forget."
7506,Gabrielle,"carlos, i'm getting my hair done! end of discussion! what are you barking at? you got your damn treat. you know, if we really want to save money, you could cut down on those cuban cigars."
8647,Gabrielle,she's two blocks away. she'll be here any second.
5699,Gabrielle,yeah. when did they stop hating each other?
6740,Gabrielle,i made you waffles! eat 'em while they're hot. what?
5536,Gabrielle,sure.
5083,Gabrielle,is that what richie said?
6588,Gabrielle,right after what?
7826,Gabrielle,relax. i told her i was fine.
7872,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry. he's a professional. he'll keep it confidential."
7043,Gabrielle,"uh, susan."
8586,Gabrielle,did you have a fun playdate with heather?
6617,Gabrielle,"i'm not mad, zach. i'm done!"
4899,Gabrielle,i'm throwing my husband a going-away party.
4543,Gabrielle,"i'm not saying it's your fault, i'm just saying, fix it!"
5163,Gabrielle,"no, susan, come on. zach attacked felicia. he, he blew up your kitchen. evidently he tried to kill mike. we can all agree this kid's a freak!"
5499,Gabrielle,ralph!make your point.
6759,Gabrielle,how was i supposed to know the cops were gonna release the photos to the press?
4352,Gabrielle,"--i'm going to be exhausted at night--just like all the other wives -- till i build up my stamina, of course, but that might take a couple years--"
8605,Gabrielle,no! i didn't want to embarrass her.
6007,Gabrielle,"fine. you can come to bree's wedding reception, as my guest."
6577,Gabrielle,of course you are!
8660,Gabrielle,boyfriends? how many do you have?
8524,Gabrielle,us?
4770,Gabrielle,pretty sure?
8437,Gabrielle,"and after that five minutes is up, then what do we do?"
6057,Gabrielle,this is exactly what we needed.especially after everything i've been through lately.i am all about relaxing and rejuvenating--
7630,Gabrielle,"yeah, the second that bitch gets home, i'm gonna let her have it. boy, you trust someone, and they just betray you. it sucks, you know?"
4223,Gabrielle,mary alice was so excited about it. so sad.
6795,Gabrielle,"hey, edie!"
6298,Gabrielle,"all right, girls, first things first things first. if you can't walk, you can't win. hit it, vern!"
6803,Gabrielle,then be prepared to suffer the consequences.
4416,Gabrielle,"well, that's it then."
7513,Gabrielle,"carlos, no!"
6867,Gabrielle,"mm, it's not as bad as it looks."
4798,Gabrielle,apparently.
7831,Gabrielle,"so apparently, after we had our little chat with juanita, she went straight to bethany and passed on the facts of life in excruciating detail."
4997,Gabrielle,"well, obviously."
7581,Gabrielle,"ellie, it's getting cold!"
4405,Gabrielle,"it's her dream, and don't you want her to be happy?"
5944,Gabrielle,"well, since this is our last time, i guess we can make the most of it."
8288,Gabrielle,"really, susan, there's not a woman in the world who doesn't know what ""i broke it dusting"" means."
7266,Gabrielle,"it's in there. well, maybe he wanted it to muffle the gun."
4818,Gabrielle,"you know once you calm down, you're going to realise i did the right thing and when that happens, i'd appreciate an apology."
7773,Gabrielle,wow. i'm sorry. i'll talk to her.
5979,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!hey, what happened to that famous chinese hospitality?"
7159,Gabrielle,"hours? are you serious? oh, my god."
4565,Gabrielle,"hi, honey. did the lawyer tell you the good news? you're gonna make bail. i found your passport."
5638,Gabrielle,"because if i did,then she, we--because--there was a chance she wouldn't have believed me,and--and that would've hurt a lot worse than anything he ever did to me."
5774,Gabrielle,"no,i got up twice already.it's your turn."
8662,Gabrielle,"and so-- they give you designer clothes, and you give them--"
7846,Gabrielle,damn.
4302,Gabrielle,"mama, i'll be right back. i'm going to the store."
4740,Gabrielle,"well, uh, there's a simple explanation for that. i, um--"
7202,Gabrielle,"hello? hey, carlos. yeah, i can't talk right now. i'm breaking up with victor. no, he's not here. he's in washington. yeah, okay, i'll explain later."
6749,Gabrielle,okay.
8565,Gabrielle,"fine. but just so we're clear, you're also latino jerk of the year."
5525,Gabrielle,or maybe you just don't love me as much as you used to.
5434,Gabrielle,here.
7292,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. i hope this isn't--last time i saw him, i told him i was leaving him."
6511,Gabrielle,"oh, fine, i'll do it."
6682,Gabrielle,"so you're--well, first, let me just say you have amazing taste. if we had met in any other context, we would so get along."
7457,Gabrielle,"i know. primo spot, isn't it? what? i have a thingy."
6637,Gabrielle,that's what you think.
6536,Gabrielle,you play that pretty well.
5425,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so sweet. i'm really gonna miss you."
6292,Gabrielle,"and i hate helping others, too, but i'm doing that, aren't i?"
4351,Gabrielle,"well, since, i'm gonna have to be doing the cooking, and the cleaning, and all the shopping, like the other wives--"
4732,Gabrielle,you know what? i don't have time to fight right now. i have laundry to do.
6282,Gabrielle,"well, if something great comes up, i might fly out, but i'm pretty settled here."
7021,Gabrielle,"oh,far be it for me to speak ill of the future mrs.carlos solis."
6989,Gabrielle,"i can't dump him on our wedding day.that's a horrible thing to do,even to victor."
8276,Gabrielle,"well, what are friends for?"
5334,Gabrielle,you're not gonna kill me?
4218,Gabrielle,"god, it's beautiful!"
7270,Gabrielle,"well, i came back for you, didn't i?"
7774,Gabrielle,and don't worry. no one will hear about this from me.
4819,Gabrielle,what's that?
8509,Gabrielle,"yeah, about that--i gotta warn you. patty's kinda got a thing for married men."
8429,Gabrielle,you think you can buy me off with presents?
5748,Gabrielle,"okay.hi.hi.oh,honey,you were right."
6621,Gabrielle,bless you.
4983,Gabrielle,susan's coming.
4715,Gabrielle,"so, uh, mike. the suspense is killing us. why don't you just tell us the bad news?"
4532,Gabrielle,"say, um, could i store some odds and ends in your garage?"
5520,Gabrielle,"okay,go get him,tiger."
7009,Gabrielle,do you think this is them?
5346,Gabrielle,thank you.
6735,Gabrielle,"it's an elevator, silly. it has an emergency stop button. i don't."
6376,Gabrielle,"well, friends come and go, but a crown is forever."
4736,Gabrielle,i'm the one who stole it.
5173,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, if you don't mind the hemorrhoids and the nausea, it's quite the party."
7094,Gabrielle,why?
4463,Gabrielle,"hi, helen!"
4225,Gabrielle,7. three couples and susan. does that sound right?
7141,Gabrielle,that's the fennel.
7434,Gabrielle,leave you? do you really think i'm that shallow?
5901,Gabrielle,"because i see the writing on the wall,and it scares the hell out of me."
6969,Gabrielle,why? what happened wasn't your fault.
6169,Gabrielle,that's the thing.carlos doesn't fold. that son of a bitch is up to something.
7688,Gabrielle,really? are you okay?
4600,Gabrielle,"i haven't seen john in weeks. he's called and left messages, but i haven't returned any. it's over, i swear."
7148,Gabrielle,"absolutely. it's kind of exciting, though."
5563,Gabrielle,are you okay?
5706,Gabrielle,"because i've read the constitution,and it does not protect ugly people."
6654,Gabrielle,what the hell is this?
5823,Gabrielle,"oh, yes."
4242,Gabrielle,"okay. well, you enjoy your new girlfriend. and if there's anything else you need, you just let me know."
6999,Gabrielle,"okay,you know,running away with you on my wedding night was crazy enough.but runnin' away to be alone is insane!"
7226,Gabrielle,"oh, so you want me to sleep with you and take your money. gee, if that were a job, what would they call it?"
5868,Gabrielle,"oh! okay,honey,only good swimmers now."
7908,Gabrielle,"i know what you've been up to, and shame on you."
8049,Gabrielle,"yeah, and i know that now, but--juanita, dance for your dad."
7132,Gabrielle,ew! how did you get those?
5095,Gabrielle,ralph.
6951,Gabrielle,i'm hardly flawless. i'm sure i have a blemish hidden away somewhere.
8102,Gabrielle,"it took a toll on us when we couldn't pay the gas bill, carlos. it took a toll on us when juanita was sent home from day care because the check bounced. but i handled it, and now it's your turn to handle it."
4175,Gabrielle,turns out i wanted all the wrong things.
7224,Gabrielle,"if i can't trust you, i don't think i can be with you."
6866,Gabrielle,oh. that's what i was trying to tell you. the meter man--he grabbed my arm and twisted it.
7693,Gabrielle,"all i'm saying is that our daughter has a weight problem, and the sooner we admit it, the better. carlos: she's only 4. but, you know, you want her to develop a weight problem? go ahead. nag, criticize, make her feel self-conscious. see what happens."
6959,Gabrielle,polling data? why are you polling? the election's over.
6145,Gabrielle,"mnh-mnh, not right now. phil and i are getting in the hot tub. ooh, phil, did you bring your suit?"
7413,Gabrielle,okay.
4964,Gabrielle,"john! john, you,you can't."
4290,Gabrielle,i think he's hiding something. i know it.
4361,Gabrielle,are they having fun?
4249,Gabrielle,"well, you won't be around tomorrow, 'cause you have school."
4250,Gabrielle,"yes, i, i went jogging today, and i think i just pushed myself too hard."
7757,Gabrielle,"well, i'll tell you what. since your mom and i are dear friends, i'll take it off your hands if you knock off $ 300."
4515,Gabrielle,"just know that whatever happens, i love you very, very much!"
7386,Gabrielle,"oh, i bet that was hard. so where'd you put 'em?"
4244,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, you'll be cruising so fast on this, no one will even notice. what? what's wrong?"
7827,Gabrielle,"what, that sometimes mommy rides daddy like a mechanical bull to get jewelry? she's 5. she's too young to understand either half of that."
5587,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's nice.do you know what they do to people in china who speak out against the government?"
4571,Gabrielle,"uh, no! no, he neglected to tell me that."
8220,Gabrielle,"oh, don't get all holier than thou, mona. i saw you pull into the doughnut shack yesterday."
7423,Gabrielle,"yes, sweetheart. i'm in the kitchen making dinner."
4221,Gabrielle,"hi honey, you're home early."
5992,Gabrielle,"yes, it would look perfect."
6647,Gabrielle,i can't believe you bought another bustier.
5591,Gabrielle,what?
5395,Gabrielle,"look, i don't mean any disrespect. it's just now that carlos is home, we need to get back on our routine, and we can't do that if he keeps running off to church and charity bake sales. we need us time. do you know what i mean?"
4867,Gabrielle,"no, 'cos if i leave then i'll be broke, and that would be awful. and if i stay he'll be in control and that's horrifying. and he cut up all my credit cards, which means i'm married to him and unable to shop, which is probably the worst of all possible worlds."
4934,Gabrielle,"oh, please!"
5150,Gabrielle,"but, i-"
4923,Gabrielle,i don't know who the father is.
8488,Gabrielle,edie would so not be surprised you're welcome.
7157,Gabrielle,"good work, boys, but i have to head out in a few minutes, so make sure you put all the stuff back in the garage. hello?"
5350,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah, this is her. did, did something happen with carlos?"
7207,Gabrielle,and you flew all the way here to twist my arm?
8478,Gabrielle,"uh, i'm sure the school will understand if you need to miss a few days."
4224,Gabrielle,we could all use a fun night.
7416,Gabrielle,"oh, edie, it wasn't a competition, but, yeah, i guess i did."
4966,Gabrielle,it's just salsa.
6955,Gabrielle,"well, the feeling wasn't mutual. you think i enjoyed sipping tea with these frumpy matrons who wore loud, polyblend pantsuits? you know how many times i just wanted to scream, ""vote for my husband, you color-blind cow!""?"""
8115,Gabrielle,"it is for you. now move! juanita solis, i am not kidding. okay. that does it. juanita. if you think i'm not gonna drag you to the bathroom, you are sadly mistaken!"
8430,Gabrielle,"well, i'd say let's talk about it tonight, but who knows if you're even gonna come home?"
8608,Gabrielle,"well, then it must've been a gambling problem."
5728,Gabrielle,how much are you gonna give him?
8434,Gabrielle,i hate that we have to this.
5565,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's about right."
7628,Gabrielle,excuse me?
8289,Gabrielle,"fine. fine. i will do it, but you owe me. i gotta go."
8685,Gabrielle,"boy, with all this passion, isn't it too bad we're not having sex?"
6116,Gabrielle,hello? there's an intruder breaking into my home. can you tell them to come armed? i think he's mexican.
5003,Gabrielle,danielle called.
5531,Gabrielle,she's okay.
8557,Gabrielle,hi. nice to meet you. you're probably wondering why i look like this.
5211,Gabrielle,"david, i know you're the lawyer and all, but trust me, it's never a smart strategy to cover this up."
5245,Gabrielle,"i said i was catholic, not a fanatic. you know, david, you could tell me to stop. just tell me to stop, and i will, or you can have me right now, on my terms."
5331,Gabrielle,and then you'll leave?
5235,Gabrielle,"i feel terrible. how was i supposed to know that he would take a bullet and suddenly realize he's in love with me? okay, look, i know i pushed you into hiring that creep, but i promise i will do anything i can to fix this."
7644,Gabrielle,"okay, so here's the deal. bree needs all of these wedding favors wrapped by tomorrow, and she's really counting on me, so-- i'm gonna need you to hurry."
8632,Gabrielle,say no more.
6201,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, this old thing? you've seen it all before. i'm just gonna wear the little blue number. will you hand me those stockings? oh, i've got a raggedy nail. you're gonna have to help me put those on."
5827,Gabrielle,you?you don't even wanna be a mother!
7437,Gabrielle,"i know, but like i said, ""for better or for worse."""
5055,Gabrielle,"carlos, what is this big emergency? i had to cancel my hair appointment with eduardo today. baby, what is it?"
6285,Gabrielle,"what, i slam one dress, and you quit on me?"
7634,Gabrielle,"about how you snitched on me to carlos? no, thanks. i'm all caught up on that."
4182,Gabrielle,"hi honey, you're home early!"
4619,Gabrielle,"hey, bob! i get why she's so angry with me, but, what i don't get is, why you're so nice."
5341,Gabrielle,"not really, no."
7685,Gabrielle,"oh, you know what? we should have a dinner or something."
5628,Gabrielle,"oh,it's in the hotel lobby.so go ahead,i'm right behind ya."
5925,Gabrielle,trying to have sex with you.
7022,Gabrielle,best wishes!
4355,Gabrielle,she sounds nice.
5566,Gabrielle,"i wasn't, but i was thinking about it on the way over here.and i realized the ass i should be kicking is yours."
7397,Gabrielle,"oh, that's good to know. uh, father, can i talk to you?"
4474,Gabrielle,"no, not really. you were always a giver."
7339,Gabrielle,"who cares?! thanks to her, i'm giving up my home, my friends, half my wardrobe. so do me a favor and never mention her name again unless it's followed by the phrase, ""that conniving skank."" ya think you can do that?"
6567,Gabrielle,it's okay. do you want some coffee?
6489,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetie. i really wish you would."
5796,Gabrielle,"oh,no,you must be mistaken. i just left her.she's at home working."
7376,Gabrielle,kinda.
6546,Gabrielle,you can buy me that toilet seat cover.
8136,Gabrielle,if you wouldn't mind.
5482,Gabrielle,"yes, it is.we worked it out."
6465,Gabrielle,uh-huh.
5567,Gabrielle,"yes!sister mary manipulated you into threatening me,but you're the idiot that fell for it."
5107,Gabrielle,"let me count the ways. um, gently, savagely, frequently, upside down--"
6075,Gabrielle,"ooh, i like rich john!"
4277,Gabrielle,"yeah? well i don't like your ironing, so there."
8130,Gabrielle,yeah. just my kids. they really know how push my buttons.
4890,Gabrielle,"sh! we'll talk later, you're watching the game."
6092,Gabrielle,"i need cash, and you don't expect me to sell my stuff, do you?"
8465,Gabrielle,"well, i guess i could do that. or i could do this. i should make some kind of speech. but think it's enough. we both know i crushed you, right? now if you'll excuse me, swizzle stick number 17 has a yacht and giant feet."
4708,Gabrielle,who knows? it might even be fun.
7106,Gabrielle,what? i spilled my drink on him.
6096,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing here? i mean, besides lowering my property value."
6070,Gabrielle,"actually, we're getting a divorce."
6478,Gabrielle,"wow, someone got an advance on their allowance."
4260,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, he's just always given me the creeps. haven't you guys notices that he's got this ""dark thing"" going on? there's something about him that just feels-"
6992,Gabrielle,come on!
6718,Gabrielle,"god, i'm such an idiot. i gave it up way too fast. now i've lost all the power."
4568,Gabrielle,"come on, honey, let's celebrate! sorry it's the cheap stuff. i had to economize. now that you're back, we can restock the wine cellar. let's toast."
4381,Gabrielle,juanita!
7050,Gabrielle,i know. do you believe that pie business? i thought bree's head was gonna explode.
8428,Gabrielle,"hey, lynette! great office. i see you're busy. don't let me disturb you. i just wanted to drop off the girls so i could talk to carlos for a sec. all right, girls, have fun with aunt lynette."
7636,Gabrielle,oh.
4835,Gabrielle,"lynnette, will you go after her?"
5557,Gabrielle,"no, we've had our differences,but that doesn't mean i'm happy to see you shipped off to alaska.brr."
5679,Gabrielle,"$20,000.00"
8635,Gabrielle,let me see your palms.
7061,Gabrielle,"did i ever tell you about my father? he had cancer, too. started in the liver, went into his bones, and ten months later, he was dead."
7593,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
6633,Gabrielle,not exactly.
6267,Gabrielle,mom?
7753,Gabrielle,be glad you're blind.
6499,Gabrielle,shh! here it comes.
6006,Gabrielle,and what?
6193,Gabrielle,"oh! oh, sweetie!"
6691,Gabrielle,you mean quit?
5682,Gabrielle,"okay. okay, look, we have to find another mother."
6874,Gabrielle,i see you've picked up the pieces.
8340,Gabrielle,"okay, we're gonna figure this out for you. were her eyes open or shut?"
5051,Gabrielle,"i'm getting really tired of this song, carlos. isn't it about time you forgave me?"
4303,Gabrielle,"you know, juanita, i'm not going to the supermarket. i'm going to the lingerie store."
8356,Gabrielle,"i'm not jealous. it's just--you can't hire her. i'm mrs. president, and i get a vote."
6877,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry. i can't make it. i have plans that day."
5619,Gabrielle,"fine.what about surrogacy?i mean,i know it's pricey,but at least the baby would look like us,and i wouldn't get stretch marks.it's a win-win."
6993,Gabrielle,"oh,focus,you idiot!come on.when are we leaving?"
5196,Gabrielle,you're a lawyer. you lie to juries all the time. can't you just make something up?
5193,Gabrielle,"look, to be honest, carlos is a little threatened by you. he thinks if we spend too much time together that something might happen."
6453,Gabrielle,"carlos, be careful! he might have a gun!"
5627,Gabrielle,"hey--i don't know about you,but i am tired of all the tension around here,so i was thinking we could go shopping,have some fun.then maybe later we can talk about the surrogacy thing,see if we can make it work."
4774,Gabrielle,"so, how much did that horse and buggy set us back?"
5214,Gabrielle,are you seeing this?
7284,Gabrielle,"oh, okay. and say what? ""yes, officer, my lover and i knocked my husband overboard twice and left him for dead. okay. bye-bye."" i don't think so."
7078,Gabrielle,state senator?
4367,Gabrielle,"oh, no, john, please don't say that. i have everything under control."
6896,Gabrielle,my flowers!
7391,Gabrielle,"so when i finally came clean, his wife told me she shredded anything that had to do with offshore accounts. she was protecting al."
7711,Gabrielle,carlos? kitchen. now.
7825,Gabrielle,"yeah, carlos, stop that. okay, go to your room, and i'm gonna bring you something for your tummy. i think she bought it."
7574,Gabrielle,"well, i suppose i could look the other way for a few months. it's the least i could do for thinking you're a whore. forgive me?"
6863,Gabrielle,"constantly? aside from today, give me one example."
6611,Gabrielle,what?
5709,Gabrielle,"well,thank you,sweetie.i clean up well for a wetback,don't i?"
4733,Gabrielle,ta-da!
8240,Gabrielle,"oh, will you excuse me a minute?"
8610,Gabrielle,"uh, i don't know. there has to be some reason. you don't fall that far that fast without making some really stupid choices."
8666,Gabrielle,"and if you don't mind, will you make sure juanita and celia do their chores, too?"
5253,Gabrielle,vern.
7451,Gabrielle,lynette!
7465,Gabrielle,"jeez. what, is there a telethon going on around here?"
7053,Gabrielle,"what, is this a test of our friendship?"
6467,Gabrielle,and you were valedictorian. what were you up to that your mother didn't know about?
5775,Gabrielle,what about my sleep?
6044,Gabrielle,it's time! i can't believe this is happening!
5582,Gabrielle,"oh,hi.do you have to sit around all day?i mean,shouldn't you be out experiencing western civilization while you have the chance?what are you doing?"
8317,Gabrielle,deal's over. i'm not covering for your stupid little fling anymore.
4298,Gabrielle,does carlos know you are coming?
7456,Gabrielle,"oh, hey there."
5440,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos."
8322,Gabrielle,i should have done it sooner.
5839,Gabrielle,"i don't have an appetite.in fact,this is all gonna go to waste.you guys should take something."
4418,Gabrielle,do you have a cell phone?
7307,Gabrielle,"detectives! any, uh, news on my husband?"
8581,Gabrielle,we're gonna be us again--the old carlos and gaby.
6945,Gabrielle,"okay, maybe a little, but it'll be weirder if you don't."
4481,Gabrielle,"susan, hi! do you want to help with the seating cards?"
7956,Gabrielle,back off!
6501,Gabrielle,i know. she practically had sparklers coming out of her ass.
4973,Gabrielle,"hey, i thought you might be thirsty."
6251,Gabrielle,"oh, see that coat i'm wearing in this shot? that's genuine ocelot fur. although the photographer was the real animal, if you know what i'm saying-- which i hope you don't. and don't ever do drugs, okay?"
4594,Gabrielle,i promise.
4152,Gabrielle,"well, he promised to give me everything i've ever wanted."
4384,Gabrielle,"what do you mean, it stopped working. that thing has, like, a $15,000 credit limit."
6952,Gabrielle,"honey, he's a multimillionaire. he runs my league."
6168,Gabrielle,you're giving me everything i want? just like that?
4144,Gabrielle,i really hate the way you talk to me.
4553,Gabrielle,"this, um, buick thing. does it include lunch?"
5508,Gabrielle,"i know,i was freakishly flexible back then.i'm sorry!look,what are we gonna do about this?"
4671,Gabrielle,did i mention why my husband's home a lot? he's under house arrest.
6561,Gabrielle,"oh, well, um, luke's gonna be here in twenty minutes, and that kind of will be a date."
6202,Gabrielle,"well, i'd do it myself, but i don't wanna get a snag."
7073,Gabrielle,you leaving already?
7569,Gabrielle,"ellie, wait. i made a mistake. can we please talk about this?"
4520,Gabrielle,what?
7178,Gabrielle,"seriously, john, you have got to get out of here."
5169,Gabrielle,"okay, enough chit chat. we only have thirty minutes left and i want to make the most of it."
5480,Gabrielle,"actually,i'm right in the middle of something,and i don't know when i'll be done."
5805,Gabrielle,"yes, she needs the bonnet.it completes the outfit."
6408,Gabrielle,yeah.
7415,Gabrielle,"okay, padre. we're ready. let's take it from the top."
4764,Gabrielle,"she treated me like trash!"" ""god rest her soul."
5687,Gabrielle,sorry.
6995,Gabrielle,"finally!carlos,where the hell are you?"
6242,Gabrielle,"i don't know what i'm capable of anymore. this divorce has turned me into this-- bitter, hateful person, and i don't like her."
7982,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
7347,Gabrielle,"oh, now you're moral all of a sudden? you didn't care where the money was coming from when you thought carlos was gonna spend it on you!"
6392,Gabrielle,so where were we?
8570,Gabrielle,"ugh. was it the ""chop chop"" thing? fine. i'm sorry. now can i borrow some blush?"
5751,Gabrielle,he's gonna light himself on fire with coffee liqueur?
4387,Gabrielle,"of course i would, why wouldn't i?"
4647,Gabrielle,i am not a mattress sales person.
4866,Gabrielle,thank you.
6627,Gabrielle,"well, your driver's an idiot!"
6704,Gabrielle,"and every time you say that, eventually gets a little further away. stop begging, or i'm not going to your rally tomorrow."
7818,Gabrielle,really? you're so lucky.
6968,Gabrielle,"god, milton, the newspaper's not even here yet."
5584,Gabrielle,did you make all of this?oh!for me? okay.
6612,Gabrielle,"little zach young? well, just how much would i have remembered?"
5547,Gabrielle,because she's ruining my marriage.
5185,Gabrielle,"oh, bob, you beat your wife. you are so not allowed to gasp."
6835,Gabrielle,what are you doing? i told you i was leaving. stop writing!
7343,Gabrielle,"oh, good. you're home."
5841,Gabrielle,i don't understand.it's from the government.
5816,Gabrielle,so why do you want to be a dad?these are your glory days.a baby would ruin your life.
5770,Gabrielle,"yeah,you should go."
6338,Gabrielle,then i will jump in and defend you.
5691,Gabrielle,we're gonna have to stare at this face for the next 18 years.i don't think now is the time to skimp on quality.
4657,Gabrielle,"you must be loving this, huh? having me serve you must be a dream come true."
4185,Gabrielle,"he's still mourning, susan, he'll probably freak out."
5522,Gabrielle,you promised!
8611,Gabrielle,"it was tiffany china, carlos."
6015,Gabrielle,"she's got glaucoma. to her, you're nothing but a hispanic blur. let me fix your tie."
7727,Gabrielle,"i got it all figured out. we duck inside, make sure we're seen by all the right people--except mrs. downing--and then after about 20 minutes, we cut out."
7243,Gabrielle,you're so blessed. makes me wanna have another one myself.
7264,Gabrielle,he was going to kill me! he had a gun.
7316,Gabrielle,"of course! i-i bet he's pretty delirious. i mean, after his ordeal, i wouldn't be surprised if he's just babbling like a crazy person!"
7076,Gabrielle,"okay, but if you did have a choice, would it be a hard one? i mean, it's not like you're in love with edie, is it?"
8334,Gabrielle,the same compensation package! we're rich!
8686,Gabrielle,what? that the card was cancelled by my lover's mommy?
6903,Gabrielle,"honey, please. if anyone should be nervous, it's me. i met victor three months ago. i mean, i'm crazy about him. it's just, the thought of saying those vows again? that's scary."
5373,Gabrielle,you mean to tell me that this miraculous conversion of yours has nothing to do with fact that the woman standing outside is a knock-out?
8167,Gabrielle,"well, thanks for the advice. you wanna add that your bill?"
6977,Gabrielle,it means so much to me that we're all here together right now.
7427,Gabrielle,"i'm right here, babe."
8241,Gabrielle,"carlos, get in here! i got a real shockeroo for you! you are not gonna believe this! brad! hi. uh, what's going on?"
4678,Gabrielle,what is that?
6334,Gabrielle,"yes, i know, i know, and it's tragic, but we are running a business. amy is sucking up all of our time, and we should be focusing on sherri. she actually has a shot at winning."
4299,Gabrielle,i'll be outside doing my yoga.
6873,Gabrielle,"oh, susan! julie told me about ian. i am so sorry. you must be devastated."
5593,Gabrielle,"well, who's forcing her?we'll pay her whatever she wants.and the best part is,with her resum,any wage will look good."
6404,Gabrielle,"oh, you care.first,you move across the street.and then, earlier today,i catch you spying on me--"
5842,Gabrielle,"oh,my--this can't be happening."
4643,Gabrielle,mm.
6470,Gabrielle,"oh, god!"
5156,Gabrielle,"with all due respect, i will decide for myself what needs to be scratched and when."
4928,Gabrielle,i am pregnant and it is all your fault.
5357,Gabrielle,mmm. i guess i owe the pope a thank-you note.
6613,Gabrielle,"is it really good, or are you just pretending you had a slice? you and i did not have sex. admit it!"
6869,Gabrielle,"no. i can't find a good flower girl. lynette keeps hinting for me to use penny. but i saw her in that preschool sing-along, and i am sorry, but we are talking zero charisma."
5008,Gabrielle,there's no way i'm dressing him.
5384,Gabrielle,"okay, i think we should all just calm down a little bit!"
6050,Gabrielle,well.
8413,Gabrielle,really?
6373,Gabrielle,"well, that's true--"
5360,Gabrielle,what is wrong with you? you are totally useless after sex.
6927,Gabrielle,good.
8015,Gabrielle,yeah. it's my hamstring. i've just been working out.
5486,Gabrielle,okay.what's the 1%?
5172,Gabrielle,"well, that settles it. when this baby's born, i'll be in charge of putting on the socks."
4314,Gabrielle,she's watching her mexican soap opera. the reverend's virgin daughter is about to be seduced by the escaped desperado. so until she puts out juanita won't even know that i'm gone.
5066,Gabrielle,oh.
4799,Gabrielle,monetary compensation? you're trying to buy us off?
4408,Gabrielle,i'm not jealous. i just don't like to share.
5776,Gabrielle,every 40 minutes? when am i supposed to have a life?
8175,Gabrielle,"oh, it's only temporary. juanita needed her coloring book back."
4800,Gabrielle,"well, in that case, care away."
8575,Gabrielle,thank you.
4701,Gabrielle,did you feel anything?
6781,Gabrielle,"hi, edie!"
7013,Gabrielle,"neither am i!you told me you wanna run away together,and then i don't hear from you for a month!"
6962,Gabrielle,"victor, ever since we met, it's been photo ops and fund-raisers, and i'm sick of it."
8012,Gabrielle,no. we don't accept charity.
5590,Gabrielle,"don't you think xiao-mei would like it better here in america?i mean,where she could learn about freedom and democracy and stuff?"
6996,Gabrielle,"oh,my god! is she okay?"
8623,Gabrielle,"well, if your idea of a good time is sitting on rusty lawn chairs in the driveway eating lard in the shape of chicken, then yeah! it's gonna be a blast."
4642,Gabrielle,you are so fired.
6377,Gabrielle,"hi. bill? i was wondering, do you have plans saturday night?"
6620,Gabrielle,"okay, i'll take my chances."
4844,Gabrielle,"john, what are you doing?"
5850,Gabrielle,"so we thought,you need a baby in your belly,we need a surrogate--win-win-win."
4986,Gabrielle,"the prescription was dated, carlos, and juanita was in a coma when this claim was filed. you did this, not your mother. at least be man enough to own up to it. she would've been."
6768,Gabrielle,"my name is gabrielle marquez, and i want you to know, right before those photos were taken, victor asked me to marry him."
8649,Gabrielle,"well, i didn't say i wasn't sedated."
8353,Gabrielle,lucy blackburn? please tell me it's a coincidence that your new vp has the same name as your ex-girlfriend.
4746,Gabrielle,what's up?
6965,Gabrielle,"okay, look, no! i already married a man who put his career before me, and i swore i wasn't gonna do it again."
4362,Gabrielle,isn't it sexist of us to generalize like this?
7481,Gabrielle,"well, why shouldn't i get something out of this? you know, the blindness didn't just happen to you."
7576,Gabrielle,don't. we're waiting for ellie. she's finishing up with a customer.
5131,Gabrielle,excuse me! we are husband and wife. when we make love it is a very sacred covenant.
7313,Gabrielle,"well, why wouldn't i? just let me grab my purse."
5379,Gabrielle,"well, sure it can. that's just a lie we tell poor people to keep 'em from rioting."
4714,Gabrielle,what?
8497,Gabrielle,"and she's the one i'd kill. i mean, really, who died and left her in charge?"
6491,Gabrielle,"uh, it was fabulous. thanks for asking."
4344,Gabrielle,mama solis. what are you doing here?
8625,Gabrielle,"cause that's what grown-ups do, sweetie. when we don't like someone, we don't punch them or say mean things. we just find subtle ways to make them feel bad about their lives. ooh, like these earrings, aunt connie can't afford them, and that'll make her sad. and this will bring her to her knees. and this will be a kick in her throat."
8532,Gabrielle,then why did you keep hanging out with her?
6562,Gabrielle,"yeah. that isn't a problem, is it? 'cause this is what friends do. they talk about each other's dates."
6734,Gabrielle,i know. that's what makes it so exciting--the risk.
6128,Gabrielle,"god, carlos! strawberries and champagne? did you really think you're gonna seduce me?"
7480,Gabrielle,that's a really mean way to put it.
4196,Gabrielle,"i don't know. be the way you used to be, surprise me, take my breath away."
4229,Gabrielle,where are you?
6575,Gabrielle,okay. so come back when you're done. i'll wait up.
7603,Gabrielle,oh.
4635,Gabrielle,are you gonna clean that spot?
4429,Gabrielle,no change. all we can do is wait and hope for the best.
4699,Gabrielle,we're all in denial about something. but you're finally facing the truth and i think that's sort of brave.
5351,Gabrielle,he what?
6673,Gabrielle,"hi. remember me? i had dinner here the other night. anyway, i was driving through your neighborhood after having, like, three iced teas, and i really have to go to the bathroom. do you mind?"
4537,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, i love you so much! i would give up a house full of expensive junk just to put this behind us, and have you home with me."
4460,Gabrielle,"""that must be a nice feeling.''"
6816,Gabrielle,is that what our friendship is worth to you--twenty pizzas? we had a pact!
5021,Gabrielle,who ever said you were the father?
6966,Gabrielle,"well, here's one less thing you have to worry about-- our wedding."
7999,Gabrielle,it's a recipe i got from a diet magazine. it's--it's fish and broccoli.
6130,Gabrielle,"what, you've been doing some thinking, and you realize that i'm your soul mate, and there's a vacancy in your heart only i can fill?"
8564,Gabrielle,"seriously, we cannot allow this photograph. next time there's an epidemic, people are gonna think i'm patient zero."
5530,Gabrielle,"if you're trying to come between me and my husband,i will take you down."
8077,Gabrielle,"me, too. me first. remember bradley scott? i ran into him today, and he's giving you a job."
6976,Gabrielle,so how do i look?
7319,Gabrielle,no. no.
8615,Gabrielle,"i didn't think so. you were always so classy. 20,40,60-- was it drugs?"
5820,Gabrielle,"so my point is,do the right thing,and no one gets hurt."
7150,Gabrielle,that's what's so exciting.
6383,Gabrielle,"back off,you son of a bi*ch!"
6108,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, put some pants on!"
7158,Gabrielle,"i'm leaving in five minutes. uh, brett, could you come here a second? how long has that van been parked over there?"
5599,Gabrielle,"absolutely.xiao-mei,you are a very special girl,so--so you take care, okay?"
4625,Gabrielle,i've tried poor but happy. guess what. it wasn't that happy.
6586,Gabrielle,zach? you're-- in your underwear.
4480,Gabrielle,could have fooled me.
5803,Gabrielle,"exactly! like,""he wouldn't have been with me if he was gettin' it at home."""
8435,Gabrielle,"well, can you at least put the radio on? i won't feel like bitching if i can sing along to something."
5631,Gabrielle,i'm pulling out.watch your boobs.
6657,Gabrielle,"apparently, the water heater in the attic had burst. everything is ruined. my clothes, my shoes, dresses. why are you smiling?"
6705,Gabrielle,"half the fun? oh, honey, if i ever do say yes--you're gonna adjust that percentage way down."
7030,Gabrielle,"generally speaking, women don't leave their husbands for guys who have girlfriends. just boot the bi*ch. what are you afraid of?"
7788,Gabrielle,but that's okay. mike's a great dad.
7170,Gabrielle,"oh, i plan to. good to see you."
5289,Gabrielle,"hi, guys."
6020,Gabrielle,you want a clear signal? how's this?
4690,Gabrielle,think he'll get violent?
6609,Gabrielle,hey. so how'd it go?
6714,Gabrielle,that's toby. he's fixing my closet.
8440,Gabrielle,i got it.
6830,Gabrielle,"vern, focus. it's never bad luck when i look fabulous."
6074,Gabrielle,"except now when we're done, i don't have to proofread your essay on ethan frome'."
7089,Gabrielle,"adam, i feel the tag of my dress sticking out, and i can't reach it. do you mind?"
4870,Gabrielle,with your student credit card?
4990,Gabrielle,"oh, your baby?"
8013,Gabrielle,"well, i have turned over a new leaf. i'm sorry about the timing, carlos, but it is what it is."
4575,Gabrielle,"hello. hi, bree. what?"
4731,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm materialistic? when the johnson's bought their new 7-series, you were the one who went right in and traded in his car for something better."
4874,Gabrielle,"well, far be it for me- to stand in the way of a young man's dream."
7069,Gabrielle,she slapped her kid?! no!
4439,Gabrielle,we weren't driving the car. we didn't chase juanita into the street!
8292,Gabrielle,what? you can't do that. you'll lose your job and all that money.
8438,Gabrielle,"say what you want about edie, she really understood men."
4319,Gabrielle,maybe you're tired of me.
7926,Gabrielle,says the man who massaged her into an orgasm.
6890,Gabrielle,"oh, i see what you're getting at. and you know what? you are right. you have been my de facto wedding planner, and you deserve to get paid. all right, what's the going rate? seven thousand? eight thousand?"
4526,Gabrielle,you call this a paint job?! i don't want to see it again until it's perfect!
4930,Gabrielle,look! it's been pulled apart and glued back together.
8656,Gabrielle,"oh, that's a pretty dress. oh, my god, it's versace!"
7690,Gabrielle,"well, next time, give her a carrot and put her on a roller coaster. have you tried to lift her lately?"
5433,Gabrielle,"no, it's better because you can do it in the comfort of your own car."
8448,Gabrielle,we're an unstoppable team.
7477,Gabrielle,what smell?
8131,Gabrielle,"well, unfortunately, they're not afraid of me."
5867,Gabrielle,yeah. i wouldn't just slam her for no reason.
6188,Gabrielle,can i tell you guys something? something i can only tell you guys?
6744,Gabrielle,"oh, you don't wanna marry her. she's a tramp. hold out for a good girl."
4420,Gabrielle,"you should go home and get some rest, eat something. you have a ton of messages from work--tanaka called; said it was urgent. carlos, i can stay here with your mother."
5238,Gabrielle,how dare you think that of me? i have been nothing but faithful to you! since you've been in here.
6934,Gabrielle,it is after three o'clock! where the hell is bree with my something new?
8283,Gabrielle,"4:00? let me think. actually, noon would be better for me. could you do noon?"
6834,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. that's the best part. he lets me be me. all right, i gotta get going."
8285,Gabrielle,how about we let it ride? double or nothingmccluskey slugs someone by 5:00.
6531,Gabrielle,how much did you pay them to say that?
4547,Gabrielle,but they won't release him on bail until they get the passport.
8550,Gabrielle,"sweetie, you're 6. there's a lot of things i can do that you don't."
6853,Gabrielle,"i can do whatever i want! in fact, my first official act of business as mayoress of fairview--is to declare today free parking day!"
4448,Gabrielle,"no, me? no, no. confession is not really my thing."
5892,Gabrielle,fine.you can use our toilet.
8163,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sure it was kind of exciting for them to have a star their midst."
4385,Gabrielle,oh.
4661,Gabrielle,"we know that you want to trust mike, but he had a dead woman's jewelry in his garage."
4749,Gabrielle,who? who blinked?
5381,Gabrielle,you are a hypocrite. the money you spent to buy your sports car could buy a mud hut for every peasant in ecuador.
6949,Gabrielle,reception starts at four.
7816,Gabrielle,"aw. what's it like, carlos?"
4939,Gabrielle,"yeah, but i wanted to talk to you in person. i have some potentially upsetting news."
5250,Gabrielle,but zach was starting to obsess with julie again.
6426,Gabrielle,"well, you've won."
6082,Gabrielle,don't laugh.i saved a bundle on airfare.
5722,Gabrielle,who's the father?
8072,Gabrielle,i don't know. i-i can't speak for carlos.
6686,Gabrielle,could you help me with the clasp?
8227,Gabrielle,really?
7927,Gabrielle,"carlos, she is just a lonely old woman yearning for some friendship and human contact. and i, for one, am happy to be that human."
7646,Gabrielle,"okay, when you yell at me, i get upset. and you know what i do when i get upset? i shop. so if we do end up homeless, guess whose fault it'll be."
5165,Gabrielle,i'm ready whenever you-
5343,Gabrielle,and i would've been a terrible mother.
4276,Gabrielle,"remember when you asked us to pack her things? well, when we did we found a note."
7558,Gabrielle,"well, i've got no solid evidence, and she's got a lease. so, bob, i was hoping you could ""solicit"" her services. that way i'll have proof."
5949,Gabrielle,"no, no, no!don't turn it off."
7602,Gabrielle,what's this?
5322,Gabrielle,excuse me?
6756,Gabrielle,"that miserable cockroach. well, if you wanna smack him around a little, i can go inside and turn up the radio."
8124,Gabrielle,but---
7144,Gabrielle,"you know, for a guy getting rubbed down by a hot nurse, you ask a lot of questions."
5268,Gabrielle,i don't care. i can't have these girls thinking i'm pregnant.
5084,Gabrielle,"well, it's not my fault. she didn't want the money."
8323,Gabrielle,"well, that means a lot, coming from a united states marine."
4627,Gabrielle,"honestly, no. john, you're a toy. a sweet, dumb toy, so you might as well go to college, because you and me, no future!"
7654,Gabrielle,"i just found $118,000 in ellie's teddy bear."
4794,Gabrielle,"yes, hello, again."
6010,Gabrielle,"well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind?"
8110,Gabrielle,because daddy has a new job that's gonna make us lots of money.
4388,Gabrielle,"oh, that is overstating it -- a little. the bottom line is, no matter how much i dislike you, i love carlos more. if carlos finds out about the money, he'll be devastated. i don't want to see him hurt. you don't have to believe i'm a good person, but at least believe i care about my husband."
5283,Gabrielle,"yeah, but that's the thing. they haven't changed. that's who they've always been. i've changed, and i honestly don't know how."
6662,Gabrielle,is that supposed to flatter me?
7534,Gabrielle,"thanks for the biscuits, edie."
6819,Gabrielle,"oh! no, i mean it."
5647,Gabrielle,she barely mentioned it.
6713,Gabrielle,"yeah, in the fridge."
8028,Gabrielle,"damn it, carlos. what are you, a moron?"
6118,Gabrielle,"whoa! whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't take sides! police officers aren't allowed to take sides.i pay your salary."
6406,Gabrielle,"bill is not boring. he is vibrant, and, and sexy."
4717,Gabrielle,"okay, well, we'll let you know."
7302,Gabrielle,"can we at least have a drink before we go? calm our nerves? i mean, you can't talk to the cops the way you've been babbling to me."
4710,Gabrielle,what's that?
5629,Gabrielle,i'm going home.
7964,Gabrielle,i don't care.
4846,Gabrielle,"if you really want to get back at him, kiss me."
4977,Gabrielle,it is a complicated situation.
8310,Gabrielle,"okay, let's just take a deep breath here--let's not do anything we're gonna regret."
4686,Gabrielle,"hello, justin."
8655,Gabrielle,"oh, well, not to push my luck, but i was thinking you could sweep the front porch and take care of the guest bathroom."
5405,Gabrielle,"sweet, little george williams."
4396,Gabrielle,that sounds like a date.
6380,Gabrielle,how did you find that out?
5553,Gabrielle,you're kidding me. why?
6243,Gabrielle,"and for what it's worth, i don't like what it's turned you into either."
7220,Gabrielle,"mm. oh, wait, wait, wait. if this is tanaka money, then you had it when we were married?"
4787,Gabrielle,whatcha doing?
6173,Gabrielle,"uh, why did you put those shorts back on?"
7952,Gabrielle,"this whole creepy, clingy ""i'm your grandma"" routine."
4446,Gabrielle,"listen, since you're here, there's something i've always wondered about. that whole thing about priests not being allowed to repeat what they hear in confessions, is that a hard rule, or just a general guideline?"
4588,Gabrielle,"mmm, it's perfect! oh, mm, crispy and burnt on the outside but nice and steamy on the inside."
8344,Gabrielle,"thank you. i mean, it's sad how it happened, but, you know, when opportunity knocks, you gotta answer the door, right?"
4366,Gabrielle,"well, before you get any friendlier, let me remind you, i can do things to you she can't even pronounce."
5526,Gabrielle,"if you really loved me,i wouldn't have to ask!fine,forget it."
6091,Gabrielle,"carlos, i see you got my flier."
7641,Gabrielle,it's a sting. go out the back now.
6828,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, carlos."
4359,Gabrielle,"doesn't it make you nervous, a boy alone upstairs with danielle?"
4881,Gabrielle,why would they call your parents? it's your account.
4634,Gabrielle,what did you say?
7290,Gabrielle,i guess two days ago. why? what's wrong?
6943,Gabrielle,i haven't gotten your reply card back yet. so chicken or fish?
5337,Gabrielle,what's this for?
8031,Gabrielle,"uh, carlos, i think it's time to put your eyedrops in. why don't you go do that?"
4951,Gabrielle,what? are you crazy? he would kill us both!
4892,Gabrielle,you know i forgot how generous men could be. i also forgot i have options. a whole bunch of them.
6441,Gabrielle,"honestly, did you think i was gonna sleep with you?"
4850,Gabrielle,"stop, you're hurting me."
7355,Gabrielle,can i say something?
6381,Gabrielle,but that doesn't prove he had anything to do with monique's murder.
6454,Gabrielle,"oh, now you're gonna give me attitude?!"
4228,Gabrielle,says the prince as he rides off into the sunset. boy did the movies ever get that wrong.
5309,Gabrielle,"ahhh! oh, my god! what do you want?"
4974,Gabrielle,"so, how's your roommate doing?"
8068,Gabrielle,"oh, right! how are you?"
6737,Gabrielle,"oh, god!"
5927,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei said the strangest thing to me when i told her you were dead.she said, please don't kill him.'"
4464,Gabrielle,how's the dress fitting?
4348,Gabrielle,you expect me to take care of this place all by myself?
5113,Gabrielle,"yes, and i have to say she's old enough to be your mother. hell, she's old enough to be my mother."
4342,Gabrielle,i don't know why you're telling me this.
4485,Gabrielle,this isn't about you.
5481,Gabrielle,all done.
7708,Gabrielle,"edie, this is not a ""we're sorry"" party. this is a ""we forgive you"" party."
5996,Gabrielle,i know he matches the drapes!
8156,Gabrielle,"get out of bed in the morning. i've only lived here a month, and i want to put a gun to my head. you know what i mean?"
8546,Gabrielle,why?
6886,Gabrielle,"well, i gotta go."
6045,Gabrielle,"carlos, i am so sorry about the--"
8691,Gabrielle,can we object to that?
7979,Gabrielle,and that is your right as a crazy old rich lady.
5812,Gabrielle,"what the hell are you doing here, frank?"
4862,Gabrielle,"no, i'm talking about my life."
5689,Gabrielle,"i don't care if it's a walk in the sewer.we are hemorrhaging money into your bank account,and i expect to see results."
4233,Gabrielle,"mum, it's no big deal. carlos and i will drive in for the baptism. problem solved. hi, how was school?"
8583,Gabrielle,"i mean, i know it was expensive, but you can't put a price tag on beauty. am i right?"
4760,Gabrielle,"no, honey, these funeral homes make a fortune trying to convince people to overspend."
7262,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, thank god you're here."
8262,Gabrielle,"it's like you saidtheir marriage is none of our business. he's the one who's cheating. if we say anything, it'll just make things worse. we're the good guys here, carlos."
6521,Gabrielle,one million dollars.
6607,Gabrielle,"hey,i am looking out for zach,too.if i dump him,it'll destroy him emotionally.better to scare him off. please?"
5023,Gabrielle,"no, i'm pregnant, you jackass!"
7968,Gabrielle,"i'm planning on having a massive hangover tomorrow, so keep the girls up late so we can all sleep in."
6504,Gabrielle,what did you do?
7537,Gabrielle,"are you done with your armchair analysis, 3- divorce annie?"
6371,Gabrielle,"what's wrong, sweetie?"
6028,Gabrielle,what were you thinking? i didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
6517,Gabrielle,"he's in jail--for murder. but susan swears he's innocent, and she wants you to get him a good lawyer. all right, we have a deal?"
6073,Gabrielle,i intend to.
8114,Gabrielle,"you've seen it a hundred times. she loses her shoe, the prince finds it--end of story. let's go."
4679,Gabrielle,carlos--
6825,Gabrielle,i didn't plan it that way. it was spur of the moment.
6879,Gabrielle,uh--my wedding?
5447,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes,come here.now on behalf of all the cheerleaders in the world,forgive us."
4238,Gabrielle,"hi, ashley. remember me? we met earlier?"
6237,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
5535,Gabrielle,son of a bitch!
5560,Gabrielle,ah! oh.that was a mistake.
5146,Gabrielle,"yeah, but that was a jealously thing. the man that my husband was trying to kill in court is not the least bit gay. trust me."
8253,Gabrielle,"well, don't spend too much. why don't you just get him a card?"
4941,Gabrielle,"we don't even know for sure if i'ts yours, so relax. okay, and i didn't come here to watch you freak out."
5611,Gabrielle,"yeah,we're just sick about it."
5091,Gabrielle,"me either, carlos. and if you expect me to go back and sweet talk her into getting the operation, i can't show up empty-handed."
6527,Gabrielle,"right, the kiss. sorry. i didn't mean to welsh on ya. all right. pucker up."
6304,Gabrielle,"you were totally walking! good job! all right, donna, you're next. get up there and make me hate your beauty."
8225,Gabrielle,what the hell for?
5801,Gabrielle,"no! no,no,no.we're doing just fine.aren't we,lily?"
7888,Gabrielle,two whole months?
7686,Gabrielle,thank you.
7258,Gabrielle,"oh, okay, well, just in case, we should run back to shore so i can grab a jacket."
7804,Gabrielle,"look at you, right on the cover!"
5791,Gabrielle,xiao-mei?xiao-mei?i'm late to meet mrs. van de kamp.i'll be back in a little while.
4585,Gabrielle,the man of the house?
7563,Gabrielle,what is he wearing? he looks like the lost member of wham!
5616,Gabrielle,"well,the doctor's not 100% positive,but it's very,very iffy."
7577,Gabrielle,"you know, i've been hitting you a lot less lately, and i don't feel like i'm getting enough credit for that."
8502,Gabrielle,"mm. all right, so they have six, and we have six. we're gonna need a tiebreaker. hey, uh, are men allowed to join the group?"
6475,Gabrielle,thank you. oh.
5659,Gabrielle,"yeah,that was a good trip."
4417,Gabrielle,"no, no, you go home. i'll take care of this. and you were never here. go. go."
5926,Gabrielle,you don't wanna have sex with me?you always wanna have sex with me.you wanted to have sex with me an hour after your hernia operation.
7805,Gabrielle,"no, it's horrible! she's gonna become this famous author and have no time at all for us."
6766,Gabrielle,i am the woman in the photos!
7865,Gabrielle,"i am done fighting off your bionic sperm. you're getting snipped, and that's final."
6921,Gabrielle,"i do, and i know you've worked really hard to make our wedding perfect."
6833,Gabrielle,"oh, vern, i can't wait for you to meet him. he's everything i've ever wanted in a man--sensitive and kind--"
6913,Gabrielle,see--susan was really upset--
4551,Gabrielle,"uh, what else do you have?"
5585,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
6098,Gabrielle,"really? wow. well, thank you. okay, you've seen my face. now you can beat it."
6217,Gabrielle,i'm gonna have to call you back.
8103,Gabrielle,"emphasis on the word ""laid."""
7058,Gabrielle,"you must be freezing. you know, i have the cutest shawl in the car, so i'm just gonna run out and get it for you."
8098,Gabrielle,"you hear that, carlos? five-star hotels."
8224,Gabrielle,"well, they're crazy. he yells, and they jump. he tells them to run all the way over here, and they do it."
7958,Gabrielle,"honey, i'm home. you wouldn't believe the traffic--"
6209,Gabrielle,"well, what? what's so funny?"
8637,Gabrielle,"trash don't change, sweetheart. she's up to something. now come on, let's go grab a lawn chair before we get stuck on the grass with the fire ants."
7407,Gabrielle,"hi, babe. i'm about to do something that's gonna make you very happy."
8486,Gabrielle,and then we dump her?
5198,Gabrielle,are you gonna help me or not?
5906,Gabrielle,"oh, okay, well, i'll just call the country club and cancel our lessons."
7075,Gabrielle,"oh, come on. edie's recovered from her little suicide attempt. don't you think it's time to move on?"
4272,Gabrielle,"for god's sake, carlos, it's yeolin's."
6957,Gabrielle,"yeah, i was trying to respect tradition--but i got horny."
6872,Gabrielle,"i love that you're so into this wedding. most men would be like, ""yeah, yeah, tell me where the church is,"" but you're as obsessed as me. you're like a hot groom and a gay best friend all rolled into one."
6195,Gabrielle,see you later!
4514,Gabrielle,carlos! carlos! i am so sorry! i am so sorry!
5797,Gabrielle,what?
5152,Gabrielle,"you have some nerve, leaving that message on my machine."
4972,Gabrielle,"i'm pregnant, and it might be yours."
8358,Gabrielle,you can call me gaby. come on in! i'm on board.
8460,Gabrielle,"okay, you really think you're hotter than me?"
8081,Gabrielle,"carlos, i've spent the last five years working with the blind. trust me, it's not that fulfilling."
6694,Gabrielle,"what? over a dress? god, what a bi*ch."
5819,Gabrielle,"no, it doesn't have to be, okay?just do the right thing and sign the release form."
6754,Gabrielle,give me the pictures!
7026,Gabrielle,"well,it's hard when you're so busy.maybe we should go away and just take a couple weeks a month.let's rediscover what it was that made us fall in love to begin with."
6078,Gabrielle,"uh, you--you're engaged? to who?!"
8352,Gabrielle,it's all part of being the president's wife. so tell me about your new hire. she's gonna be your number two?
4957,Gabrielle,"i'm going to freshen up, and i'll be right back."
4827,Gabrielle,worse. i read them.
5604,Gabrielle,"carlos,she thinks of us as family."
7215,Gabrielle,"i don't have to sleep with him, just stay with him for political reasons. it's basically a modeling fee for a 13-month photo op."
8161,Gabrielle,okay. thank you.
4472,Gabrielle,john!
7710,Gabrielle,i can see that. i can see a lot of things--things that can never be unseen.
7171,Gabrielle,"sorry about that. a complete shock. i mean, of all people to run into."
7350,Gabrielle,no!
5231,Gabrielle,yeah. why not?
4285,Gabrielle,we had no idea.
6401,Gabrielle,"nice try, carlos."
4952,Gabrielle,john!
5576,Gabrielle,"oh, the slave.wow. looks well-fed."
6021,Gabrielle,"hi there. i just wanted to say you're doing a great job, tad. that's such a masculine name."
4350,Gabrielle,"god, i'm gonna miss this, carlos."
6095,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, the gloves aren't just off-- they're 70 % off! get your cashmere gloves!"
4501,Gabrielle,"because she'll tell carlos, and he'll divorce me!"
5265,Gabrielle,"get me into this dress, and i will pay you ten more dollars a week."
8203,Gabrielle,excuse me?
8252,Gabrielle,"oh, it's a gift. sure, yeah. we'd love to help out. so what's the occasion?"
7549,Gabrielle,"hey, ellie, you got a sec?"
7703,Gabrielle,"really? well, i thought running through that guy's sprinkler would've refreshed you. now come on!"
8263,Gabrielle,hey. when did you two get here?
7587,Gabrielle,"carlos, i was a fashion model in the '90s. i know cocaine."
8667,Gabrielle,"all right, i'll see you inside."
7042,Gabrielle,"not the same girl like she's changed, or not the same girl because she's been replaced by a robot?"
6212,Gabrielle,you did this just to get me in bed?
5043,Gabrielle,"no, we're not."
4183,Gabrielle,"i, uh, i just finished a workout."
4739,Gabrielle,in what way?
5997,Gabrielle,and i want my pearl necklace back. don't think i didn't notice that you swiped it.
7028,Gabrielle,are you serious?
5663,Gabrielle,you're in advertising.you can do it.just write us a character reference saying we're great with kids.
5338,Gabrielle,"okay, that's ridiculous. besides, i don't feel what you think i'm feeling."
7127,Gabrielle,"interesting. question--when was the last time you were in the bar and heard a guy turn to his friend and say, ""hey, check out the soul on that girl""?"
5385,Gabrielle,carlos!
7196,Gabrielle,"so what are you suggesting, we stay with victor and edie?"
6216,Gabrielle,"oh! hello? uh, there's been an accident. my husband--he--"
5758,Gabrielle,that is after the baby is in.you have to connect it to the car first!i told you we should've got an s.u.v.!
5458,Gabrielle,"oh,oh!it looks like you could use a hand."
4641,Gabrielle,excuse me?
5661,Gabrielle,"so we like to have fun. i mean,who doesn't understand that better than an unwed,knocked-up teenager?"
7640,Gabrielle,the cops are coming. go.
5946,Gabrielle,"so i'm gonna go shopping and then i'm gonna see my trainer, and i'll definitely be gone for, like, three hours.okay. well, i gotta go.have fun."
5227,Gabrielle,for what?
6745,Gabrielle,"look, victor--getting divorced really kicked my ass. i'm sorry. just--next time i get married, i've gotta be sure."
6550,Gabrielle,hello.
6513,Gabrielle,"wow, you have your own recording studio in your house?"
8221,Gabrielle,"oh, really? well, try this on for size. i'm going back to bed, because i'm tired. and when i wake up, maybe i'll have some cake, and you can't stop me."
5200,Gabrielle,"hey, that's my wine!"
5798,Gabrielle,"lily?lily,mommy's coming!"
8218,Gabrielle,what the hell do you think you're doing?
4486,Gabrielle,whh--how can compare me to karl? it's not fair. you have no idea what my life is like.
5368,Gabrielle,huh?
7507,Gabrielle,why don't you get a job?
7378,Gabrielle,"carlos, just calm down, okay? i'm sure al has an access code or a copy or some super nerd way to get back into the account, okay? i know we can fix this."
4878,Gabrielle,because i'm in a lovely restaurant having a lovely meal that i now can't pay for!
5739,Gabrielle,so you think bree punched andrew in the face?'cause i don't.
5862,Gabrielle,"honey,why aren't you dressed yet?we have to be at the fertility clinic in 40 minutes!"
5134,Gabrielle,oh really. then how about for this?
5363,Gabrielle,a new path?
6228,Gabrielle,"as a matter of fact, i do have a few thoughts.carlos, you're a dead man! do you hear me?"
5897,Gabrielle,"oven, carlos. the oven.a well-cared-for,well-paid oven."
7732,Gabrielle,"that was mr. bowman, wasn't it?"
5891,Gabrielle,"yes, xiao-mei,that would be good."
6294,Gabrielle,vern? a moment.
6587,Gabrielle,you've been here all night?
5549,Gabrielle,"and if that wasn't enough, he is saying her name in his sleep. it's disgusting.he's like a lovesick puppy."
6135,Gabrielle,he despised you for saying no?
5424,Gabrielle,"sister mary, what a lovely surprise."
7027,Gabrielle,how's next week?
7068,Gabrielle,um--sorry. victor needs me at this--political thing. damn. damn. damn.
8391,Gabrielle,you needed a job. i did you a favor. and then i brought you hot cocoa. why don't you ever thank me?
6616,Gabrielle,"no, there will be no clapping! you, moron, come with me!"
5281,Gabrielle,"it was, um, weird."
4637,Gabrielle,clean it now.
8631,Gabrielle,"wow, this place is looking worse than ever."
6885,Gabrielle,only because i admire your taste. it's not theft. it's an homage.
7715,Gabrielle,"carlos, i don't need to spend lots of time with you. and frankly, the kids are on the fence."
7575,Gabrielle,"we like you. if you have first and last months' rent, we'd like you even more."
4401,Gabrielle,i sure would.
5303,Gabrielle,we all grieve differently.
8473,Gabrielle,"well, you know what? i have a voice inside my head that says you're wrong. it tells me that 50 years from now, you and i will still be wearing dresses too tight and walking in heels too high and going to bars where we'll meet old geezers who'll buy us drinks with the last of their social security checks."
7913,Gabrielle,lucky you.
5224,Gabrielle,you're not gonna eat?
7049,Gabrielle,"hey, what's up?"
8274,Gabrielle,"they had theater tickets, and their sitter canceled. we're only gonna watch their kids for a couple hours."
6156,Gabrielle,"really? oh, so are you, big boy! yes!"
5257,Gabrielle,good. you know what? it's a little snug.
8045,Gabrielle,oh. i had to sell it a few months ago so i could make the mortgage. i'm sorry.
6895,Gabrielle,you don't mean that. that's just a big dramatic gesture.
6975,Gabrielle,"he blew off eighty million dollars? well, if he cares about me so damn much, why am i not hearing this from him?"
8083,Gabrielle,how do you sleep with someone and not remember?
7257,Gabrielle,"uh, actually, i'm really cold. maybe we should bail and do this another day. you know, when it's warmer."
7620,Gabrielle,"well, i couldn't risk doing it in my room. ever since carlos went blind, he's developed a strong sense of smell. i don't know if you happened to catch a whiff of roy, but that is one telltale odor."
7515,Gabrielle,"carlos, i mean it. who's it gonna be - me or the dog?"
4339,Gabrielle,carlos.
7595,Gabrielle,"okay, look, i'm all for doing my civic duty, but this woman-- she's-- sort of a-- friend. and now you're asking us to trick her? i'm not sure we're comfortable with this."
8059,Gabrielle,you should know that watch is a knockoff. i sold the real one two years ago to get the roof fixed.
8041,Gabrielle,"carlos, what's wrong?"
6084,Gabrielle,"me, too.do you wanna sit down? you know, you're pretty hard to stay mad at."
7843,Gabrielle,her place makes the best pizza in town.
7629,Gabrielle,"that little snitch. i can't believe she did that! well, thanks for letting me know."
8002,Gabrielle,"hey, i'm not a short-order cook. i don't have time to make different meals for everyone."
6329,Gabrielle,"yes, i'm unbelievable.close your mouths."
7277,Gabrielle,we looked for six hours. he's gone.
8663,Gabrielle,"yeah. okay, well--don't take this the wrong way, but that's not exactly from the versace virgin line."
4611,Gabrielle,"well, i heard that you're going full time with your gardening business. what happened to college?"
5559,Gabrielle,maybe not--but you certainly are.you missed a spot.
8039,Gabrielle,what?
6794,Gabrielle,would you guys excuse me?
4998,Gabrielle,"i am not lying for you, carlos."
4241,Gabrielle,okay! so we're good. right?
8542,Gabrielle,there's an extra piece of cinnamon toast on the table.
5813,Gabrielle,like hell!
8181,Gabrielle,i wish i had one.
5117,Gabrielle,"how many times did you say it? how many times did you whisper in my ear, ""you're the only woman i'll ever love?"""
7852,Gabrielle,"well, i hope to god you're right. and what does this number mean anyway?"
4615,Gabrielle,what?
8137,Gabrielle,"hey, you're the one who told me to get creative."
8064,Gabrielle,you quit?! why?
7894,Gabrielle,"and so what if he fires you? once virginia tells all of her rich lady friends about what you did for her, they'll be lining up around the block."
6152,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry.no offense,you're a nice guy.i'm just not into you that way.oh,god,phil! yes,yes,give it to me!"
4216,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. carlos, what have you done?"
8090,Gabrielle,hahaha--
6178,Gabrielle,"well, that's fantastic! i get half, right?"
4751,Gabrielle,"oh my god! honey, that means we can keep the house!"
6802,Gabrielle,"look, edie, just find your own men and stop snapping up other people's castoffs!"
8609,Gabrielle,she never missed bingo night at immaculate heart-- and she was lutheran.
6626,Gabrielle,look what you did!
7210,Gabrielle,and isn't there an election around that time?
8094,Gabrielle,"i know. just listen to what bradley has to say, and if at the end of the evening you're still not interested, i support you completely. deal?"
5157,Gabrielle,are you hitting on me?
6524,Gabrielle,i know! you're such a good dancer! where'd you learn how to salsa?
4161,Gabrielle,it's dark; you just can't see that the lawn has been mowed.
6710,Gabrielle,not a peep. twenty-four hours.
4906,Gabrielle,"well, you assumed wrong."
5881,Gabrielle,"oh, well,i'm sorry to hear that.so, uh, did you move my beauty products?they're not in the bathroom."
8489,Gabrielle,you're good at this girl talk thing.
6530,Gabrielle,by who? the same girl that taught you to use your tongue like a windshield wiper?
5883,Gabrielle,all of it?even my hair pomade?
7250,Gabrielle,"for god sakes, carlos, am i gonna have to change this number?"
6540,Gabrielle,that's not true.you'd have me.as a friend.a friend friend.not a girlfriend. really cannot overstress that.
5795,Gabrielle,good for you.i love that spa.
7135,Gabrielle,"this is serious, okay? if victor wakes up with a zoo in his pants, there's gonna be hell to pay."
5271,Gabrielle,"bree, my friends are models. they're never happy for anyone."
7409,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. i wanted it to be a surprise, but we're getting married! father, hit it."
6399,Gabrielle,"uh, there's no signature. sorry. this is kind of awkward."
8360,Gabrielle,i'll bet. so were you surprised when the door opened?
4533,Gabrielle,sooner is better than later!
4512,Gabrielle,i uh.
5141,Gabrielle,"yeah, but when we would finish arguing, we had this great sex! now all we do is fight and there's no payoff and it sucks! you and i need to get laid!"
8375,Gabrielle,"well, then how else did it get here?"
8257,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. i think they do.
6915,Gabrielle,"so after an hour of this, i suddenly heard myself say--"
6423,Gabrielle,"okay, i see what you mean."
5054,Gabrielle,"sure, baby."
4138,Gabrielle,hmm.
6053,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's something."
7020,Gabrielle,that old battle-ax is gonna outlive us all!
6648,Gabrielle,"in a slump, huh? how long's it been?"
5778,Gabrielle,"psst,xiao-mei.psst,wake up."
6910,Gabrielle,morning.
6350,Gabrielle,"oh, honestly? um, i hate it. it's like i've forgotten how to date."
6375,Gabrielle,"she was so excited. well, she's your best friend. why don't you just tell her the truth? she'll understand."
6355,Gabrielle,you got it.
6477,Gabrielle,"aren't you sweet? uh, well, anyway, i--i'd love to catch up, but i'm kinda waiting for someone."
7837,Gabrielle,so--do you think there's any chance juanita could rejoin your playdate?
8217,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, maybe you should take it up with my lawyer. here he is."
5463,Gabrielle,"tom, i need to wipe up.do you have a towel?"
4581,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know. the feds towed away my maserati. my husband is, is a felon, and i spend my days getting groped by fat tracker salesmen at trade shows. i am well aware things change!"
4325,Gabrielle,"okay, this is getting really weird. i think we should go to the police."
6068,Gabrielle,nothing. i just-- i can't get over how mature and confident you are. you've really changed.
5871,Gabrielle,"sweetie,i need some more cream."
4636,Gabrielle,the one i told you to clean.
8055,Gabrielle,fell off a table. don't want to talk about it.
7566,Gabrielle,"ellie, what are you doing?"
6040,Gabrielle,what?
8499,Gabrielle,"well, that's three. who else can we get?"
8510,Gabrielle,"yes, she's like that. she'll give you the bra off her back."
6777,Gabrielle,"no. damn things traveled five thousand miles, and they were still moist."
7730,Gabrielle,"well, it's the caterer! everything is fabulous. but would you be a dear and get me some more wine?"
7478,Gabrielle,"move it along, pops. we're gonna be here a while."
6591,Gabrielle,"okay, okay, stop talking. i'm getting nauseous."
4932,Gabrielle,"don't insult me, carlos! you've been whining about wanting a baby for months. who else could it have been?"
4860,Gabrielle,"one more thing. if you ever hurt me again, i will kill you."
5278,Gabrielle,hi!
8333,Gabrielle,he sure will. the man has a plane to catch.
5781,Gabrielle,"well,she's a baby.you hold her.you bounce her and, i don't know,maybe sing a little something."
8135,Gabrielle,"well, i know how much you love him, but--it was your daddy."
5324,Gabrielle,"yeah, so?"
5327,Gabrielle,"you know, i also got a facial, and later on, i'm gonna get a pedicure and an eyebrow wax, so there."
8417,Gabrielle,hi there.
6632,Gabrielle,"i think i'd rather vote for the other guy--you know, the one who didn't wreck my car?"
4297,Gabrielle,what are you doing here?
6387,Gabrielle,where the hell are you?
5684,Gabrielle,"no, plain i can handle.carlos,since that woman has walked into our house,the clocks have stopped working."
6679,Gabrielle,thanks.
5501,Gabrielle,"oh,my god!"
6238,Gabrielle,"yeah, everything's fine. having a little squabble. give us a minute. carlos, where do you think you're going with that?!"
7733,Gabrielle,what kind of man leaves his sick wife at home to go party with mommy?!
8319,Gabrielle,"well, at least be man enough to tell maria, because if you don't, i will."
5873,Gabrielle,"honey, it's 100 bucks an ounce.that tends to make everyone a little nauseous."
4920,Gabrielle,"carlos, you son of a bitch! i am pregnant and it's all your fault!"
5060,Gabrielle,seven thousand dollars?!
5821,Gabrielle,"signed, sealed, delivered.lily's ours."
6982,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos. didn't know you were in here."
4868,Gabrielle,"i'll figure something out. i'm sorry. i'm not much fun today, i'm going to go."
6111,Gabrielle,"yeah, the cap was loose, and i know how your sick mind works."
7071,Gabrielle,probably. why?
7035,Gabrielle,"uh, that's impossible, because he's there! there he is!"
6758,Gabrielle,"okay--yeah. but guard them with your life. yeah, especially that one."
4674,Gabrielle,how? how are you handling it?
8038,Gabrielle,what? what's he saying?
6481,Gabrielle,"here, let me get it."
7764,Gabrielle,"guys, hey, knock it off back there. oh, god. what now?"
4587,Gabrielle,mmm.
4256,Gabrielle,her real name?
4346,Gabrielle,it's a big house. i need help.
5529,Gabrielle,now that's my guy.
5045,Gabrielle,"isn't it bizarre that paul and mary alice had this secret all those years, and we didn't even know about it?"
6573,Gabrielle,"oh, i think you've got lots of choices. here's one of them."
7667,Gabrielle,wait! she's gonna steal our money!
5935,Gabrielle,the best you've ever had.
4261,Gabrielle,yes!
6726,Gabrielle,good.
5145,Gabrielle,is this about the gay bashing thing? he's innocent.
7312,Gabrielle,huh?
4382,Gabrielle,"well, how much did you have on you? it couldn't have been much."
7110,Gabrielle,bree saw you slap your daughter.
7352,Gabrielle,"you! aah! oh! oh! no! no! what did you do?! what did you do, edie?!"
7328,Gabrielle,"you would think so, but no such luck. that vindictive have told victor everything."
5849,Gabrielle,"uh-- well,there's just one little thing--the immigration laws have gotten really tough in this country,so we're a little behind the eight ball going in.but we pled your case,and we fought tooth and nail,and the law says you can stay--but only if you have our baby."
5608,Gabrielle,"no,i'm just surprised you're here.it's valentine's day.don't you and mr. hedgefund have plans?i know carlos and i do."
8515,Gabrielle,patty lives six blocks away. i live down the street. why didn't you ask me to take you?
7920,Gabrielle,what's to get ready? you buy a $9 sheet cake and fling a piata over a tree and bam! party time.
7533,Gabrielle,"don't judge me. you don't know this hound from hell. i raise my voice a teensy bit, and she barks, or i give carlos a little smack, and she growls."
4136,Gabrielle,absolutely. wouldn't want them to think we're not happy.
4814,Gabrielle,if you didn't take the plea deal the government would have seized the settlement.
6327,Gabrielle,"well, why don't you ladies talk it over? and i'm gonna work on posture with the girls."
4329,Gabrielle,"go on, try it on."
8166,Gabrielle,why would they want to talk about their lives? their lives are boring.
5415,Gabrielle,"we are supposed to be working on our marriage, carlos, but we can't do that as long as our lady of perpetual stick-up-her-butt has you worrying about thirsty orphans."
6002,Gabrielle,hey. you are supposed to be on bed rest!
5369,Gabrielle,but it's not even sunday.
6390,Gabrielle,"well,as you can see, i have more pleasant things to focus on."
5783,Gabrielle,okay.
4510,Gabrielle,"but helen, you have to believe me. it's over now."
6799,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't know. off the top of my head--dating your friends' exes."
4793,Gabrielle,i love you.
6146,Gabrielle,not in front of arlos-cay! go upstairs. i'll meet you there.
5696,Gabrielle,nope. latino.proud of it.
8030,Gabrielle,it was? i didn't know that. i thought it was some stupid collectors item.
7662,Gabrielle,"okay, we really need to get caller i.d."
4805,Gabrielle,because i don't want to have kids and you do.
4747,Gabrielle,"oh, bree, i-i can't take that."
5601,Gabrielle,"carlos, she wouldn't have been just a maid.she would have been the best damn maid ever."
4826,Gabrielle,"uh huh. i'll even give you an example. remember the time you were in jail and you told me about your secret compartment and you told me to burn the papers that i found in there. well, me being pretty and therefore stupid, i forgot."
7989,Gabrielle,that's fantastic!
6500,Gabrielle,"i mean, i knew she had a shot at the top five, but to actually win?"
6970,Gabrielle,you only suggested it. you can't make him go after something he doesn't want.
5741,Gabrielle,because i remember being 17.and i would've done a hell of a lot more than punch myself in the eye to get a car.
8684,Gabrielle,"oh no, i'm just at the grocery store wondering if i should buy a ticket. thanks a bunch, mr. hartley. so what time should i bring carlos to the da's office tomorrow? great."
7806,Gabrielle,you have a marketing plan. you wanna see my marketing plan?
6696,Gabrielle,what happened? did you have some little mistress on the side?
6311,Gabrielle,"well,honey,most models don't eat pizza. well, at least not without having a finger for dessert."
5895,Gabrielle,"that is not the point. we are a week into this pregnancy,and you're already putting xiao-mei's needs before mine."
4622,Gabrielle,"please, calm down!"
7568,Gabrielle,here's the thing. i thought you were a hooker. so i had lee proposition you so i could catch you in the act. but guess what? you passed the test. everybody inside for margaritas.
5649,Gabrielle,"no,i'm good."
7007,Gabrielle,new neighbors.what do we know?
7820,Gabrielle,"no, i think we're done."
6079,Gabrielle,how could you do this to me?i would never have let you seduce me if i knew you were getting married.
6260,Gabrielle,did i say that? water under the bridge. i thought it was funny.
6486,Gabrielle,wait a minute. who says i need someone to take care of me?
7535,Gabrielle,we're fine. this is who we are. this is our relationship.
8011,Gabrielle,that only covers 85%. and we are broke.
7139,Gabrielle,"well, the doctor says you need to relax, and i know just how to relax you."
6058,Gabrielle,yeah?
7896,Gabrielle,"oh, i need to sweet-talk him into giving carlos two months off."
7168,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah, so i married the mayor. kooky, huh?"
7238,Gabrielle,that's amazing. where should we go?
5160,Gabrielle,i'll pay you six and i expect a conjugal visit tomorrow by noon.
7869,Gabrielle,okay. but i'm gonna talk to bob.
8597,Gabrielle,"wow, it's been years! the last time i saw you was at that charity fashion show. wasn't that fun?"
5401,Gabrielle,"you listen to me, you little bitch. you do not want to start a war with me."
4204,Gabrielle,i'm glad i could help. education is very important.
5987,Gabrielle,xiao mei is going to be fine!once that baby comes her slate is going to be wiped clean.she's going to walk away and live her american dream!me?i'm going to be stuck!a single mother raising a child alone.haggling with lawyers over who gets the kid at christmas.my american dream is officially dead.
4558,Gabrielle,"just doing a little shopping, trying to get my mind off things."
6787,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, edie. come on. it would make me happy to know who's making you happy."
6722,Gabrielle,"yes, it was."
4859,Gabrielle,you want my respect? then tear up the post nup!
7342,Gabrielle,oh!
5884,Gabrielle,"yeah, well,it gives me volume,so i guess we're both gonna have a problem."
4891,Gabrielle,"oh, you've heard it all before. girl meets boy. boy buys girl nice things. girl leaves happy."
4927,Gabrielle,i'll call 911.
6358,Gabrielle,nope.
7345,Gabrielle,it's worthless to you!
8198,Gabrielle,here you go. all signed.
8035,Gabrielle,"so you see, it belonged to my husband's grandfather, and if i don't get it back, i am telling you, i'm gonna be in the crapper."
4363,Gabrielle,"well, who am i to argue with sociologists? wow this, uh, this guacamole has got a kick. i'm going to run to the little girls' room. you guys go ahead, i might be a while."
4164,Gabrielle,you see that man who just walked away? can you make sure he has a drink in his hand all night long.
5388,Gabrielle,"no, i mean it. i'm sorry. i wanna be a better person, too. i'm sick of being bad. forgive me?"
6920,Gabrielle,"how? look i know i shouldn't have offered, but i did. i can't just take it back."
4797,Gabrielle,uh huh.
6942,Gabrielle,chicken or fish?
6286,Gabrielle,"you're opening up a salon? god, could you get any gayer?"
6374,Gabrielle,that's a good point. now i wish i hadn't told amy.
7377,Gabrielle,i'm texting someone.
8644,Gabrielle,so what's one more? they'll never know the difference.
5786,Gabrielle,"oh,no,xiao-mei,that's okay. that's okay. i know you were up all night with the baby,and i really appreciate it.you know,i'm very grateful for everything you've been doing for lily.so to thank you,i bought you a gift certificate to my spa.and you can take a whole day off and just really pamper yourself."
7221,Gabrielle,which also means you had it when we got divorced.
7017,Gabrielle,"oh,my god,are you serious?"
4511,Gabrielle,carlos.
5643,Gabrielle,seriously?but i thought you wanted a kid with your own dna?
5524,Gabrielle,you used to go crazy when men would so much as look at me the wrong way--and that's when i had clothes on.
7231,Gabrielle,"victor, i know you're only doing this because a divorce would hurt your run for governor."
8395,Gabrielle,will you still be my spy?
5015,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, i'm talking about his other crime."
4781,Gabrielle,"go to hell, carlos!"
6183,Gabrielle,"oh. well, i was trying to do that with exercise,but why risk a heart attack? make mine a double!"
4811,Gabrielle,oh that. mr steinberg?.
5124,Gabrielle,"that's okay, sweetie. i'm good."
4735,Gabrielle,why should i have to wait? it's my port-a-potty.
8566,Gabrielle,"oh, can i at least use the bathroom first?"
4269,Gabrielle,he was late.
7298,Gabrielle,"carlos, please."
6568,Gabrielle,"just finish your soup, and we'll get naked."
8451,Gabrielle,lynette's beautiful.
7371,Gabrielle,"tragic. i found out everything victor had is in milton's name, and he told his father about us, so i'm not getting a penny."
7632,Gabrielle,"i got news for you, carlos. you're blind. you don't have a choice anymore. you have to believe what i tell you. just like when i hand you the deodorant, you have to believe it's not oven cleaner. i know it's not fair. i know it gives me absolute power, but tough. you're screwed. deal with it! are we good?"
6421,Gabrielle,"no, no, no! wait, wait, wait. i just need a couple more minutes. i need to know the truth."
7828,Gabrielle,"carlos, if she was standing there any longer than five minutes, there was nothing natural about what she saw."
4695,Gabrielle,"so, have you been acting on these feelings?"
5788,Gabrielle,"oh,you're welcome.all right,lily needs to be bathed and put to bed.i don't wanna miss my yoga class."
7287,Gabrielle,"he took the lord's name in vain. look, we have a good plan. let's just stick to it."
7229,Gabrielle,"well, i'm-- sort of leaving you."
5528,Gabrielle,what are you doing?
5802,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
6438,Gabrielle,there's no signature.
6223,Gabrielle,you can stop now.
6085,Gabrielle,who says it has to end?
7725,Gabrielle,"oh, it's just the caterers putting glasses and silverware on the tables. they make some racket, huh? but the decorations are stunning. especially that waterfall effect."
8387,Gabrielle,"ooh! what's going on? i mentioned lucy, and you get all weird. is something going on with her--and carlos?"
6553,Gabrielle,"oh, that'll happen a lot faster if you just hop on board."
8588,Gabrielle,"then go move in with heather, 'cause i'm not getting you one."
8464,Gabrielle,"see ya in an hour, loser."
6117,Gabrielle,"all right, but we're going through a very messy divorce, and he moved back in on me. and everyone knows the wife keeps the house, and the husband gets the crappy apartment. it's the american way."
4469,Gabrielle,what's wrong?
7680,Gabrielle,she's only 4 1/2.
7687,Gabrielle,i had two children.
6847,Gabrielle,"vern, you're just awful. and as it happens, so am i."
6263,Gabrielle,"are you serious? well, i can't tell because your face doesn't move anymore."
8383,Gabrielle,"i don't think that'll be a problem. by the way, you're gonna be reporting to this woman lucy. she's a real star, so you're gonna wanna keep an eye on her."
7689,Gabrielle,"carlos, what's with all the cheese?"
7960,Gabrielle,"family?! lady, you had carlos fired."
8650,Gabrielle,"yeah, when i think about everything that little girl's been through--her dad walked out, her mother's in jail, the way she bounced from relative to relative--i just want this to be the end of the line for her."
5733,Gabrielle,"okay,we're done."
8272,Gabrielle,"i mean, let's be honest, susan. you weren't exactly over the moon when you heard they were gonna live together."
5201,Gabrielle,"oh for pete's sake, carlos. at least listen to the man."
5139,Gabrielle,"not just for me. for us. in case you haven't noticed, carlos, our marriage is still on shaky ground."
4879,Gabrielle,i ate already!
7323,Gabrielle,what?
8554,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, once you see this skin without foundation, you may want to rethink that."
7165,Gabrielle,"wow, look at you. congratulations."
5375,Gabrielle,you said she touched your soul so i just want to make sure her hands are clean.
8626,Gabrielle,"oh, no, sweetie. we have to go. they're family."
6570,Gabrielle,guess someone's in a hurry to get on with the evening.
7815,Gabrielle,"can i ask why? i mean, you can't see it."
4215,Gabrielle,"yes, it is."
4508,Gabrielle,almost a year. but it's over now.
4456,Gabrielle,hmmm? what is?
6409,Gabrielle,what?
7431,Gabrielle,"i'll tell you what's going on. ""in three months. four, tops."""
7303,Gabrielle,you okay with tequila?
5496,Gabrielle,"ralph,if this is about luis overwatering the hydrangeas again,i told you,no one likes a tattletale."
5818,Gabrielle,"no, no, no.i am not letting that idiot use my baby as a bargaining chip."
4803,Gabrielle,are you trying to buy us off?
7278,Gabrielle,"it was self-defense, right? i mean, he was trying to kill us."
7782,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry. i was too busy trying to explain to her why m.j. doesn't wear a dress like all the other little girls."
4876,Gabrielle,of course you may. if you will just give me a moment.
5273,Gabrielle,no.
4200,Gabrielle,"no, no, he doesn't have a clue, god love him. it's just, i was thinking, that when you come over to garden, you might actually have to garden."
4146,Gabrielle,fine. i'll go. but i'm keeping my back pressed against the wall the entire time.
6487,Gabrielle,"well, they were wrong. thank you for lunch, zach."
4552,Gabrielle,"a warrior princess? mr. gibbs. i am a professional model. look at this bone structure. this face is a cash cow, and if you don't have the vision to take advantage of that, then maybe i'm at the wrong agency."
8514,Gabrielle,was that patty rizzo?
6284,Gabrielle,"well, i hope it's more fabulous than this dress. i look like something ike turner would hit."
7931,Gabrielle,"anyway, we're good. so have a nice night."
5933,Gabrielle,"you don't even have to say it out loud.if you see hymen, just give me a thumbs up."
6552,Gabrielle,"oh. well, why don't you try it out?"
5356,Gabrielle,"well, what did they do?"
5410,Gabrielle,"not god, my husband."
4970,Gabrielle,"if you want what's best for the baby, you will help me. help me make sure this baby doesn't grow up poor like i did."
8349,Gabrielle,"look, lynette, you're my friend, and i love you, but as far as knowing if you're any good at your job--"
4376,Gabrielle,"oh, i thought we would stop here for lunch first. this place has the best buffet in town. all you can eat crab legs. oh no!"
4845,Gabrielle,"no, you're not going to do anything."
6299,Gabrielle,"remember, eyes forward, shoulders back, hips square. look left, look right, whip and walk. yes, i'm unbelievable. close your mouths."
8347,Gabrielle,"well, i thought you did advertising."
5033,Gabrielle,"hi, uh, i need a paternity test."
8196,Gabrielle,why not?
6129,Gabrielle,"oh, right, right. you know, i may be living with you until the divorce is final, but it doesn't mean i have to put up with your cheesy come-ons."
8492,Gabrielle,"yeah, i just joined."
4684,Gabrielle,"well, i'm not interested in becoming one of your friends. get out of my bedroom."
7903,Gabrielle,"oh, i bet he does! where is he? is she here now?"
4958,Gabrielle,you sit. sit!
7187,Gabrielle,please!
5419,Gabrielle,i'm concerned about the drought in kenya.
7438,Gabrielle,i'll work on it.
6324,Gabrielle,can't you give me a second chance?
7633,Gabrielle,"thank you. now please, i just lost a friend. stop being so insensitive."
5523,Gabrielle,"it doesn't work that way.okay,look,i'm really trying to understand your moral dilemma here,i am.but if you don't get my pictures back,i'm gonna be humiliated.you think our gardener is the only local pervsurfing the web?"
8362,Gabrielle,what? but--you two used to have sex.
5880,Gabrielle,carlos--what's going on?
6336,Gabrielle,"amy! for god sakes, little miss snowflake does not scratch down there!"
5574,Gabrielle,"oh, bree,come on, dish already!"
5970,Gabrielle,oh my gosh!
4596,Gabrielle,"i'm the one who was sleeping with your son.but, helen, it's over now."
8308,Gabrielle,"well, call the vatican, 'cause we're gonna need a manger and some hay."
7455,Gabrielle,"no, i think you have to have a wheelchair to get one of those."
4437,Gabrielle,you need to keep a low profile right now.
7446,Gabrielle,just eat them. carrots are good for your--just eat them.
7994,Gabrielle,"it's okay, it's okay. let her talk. at least she's being honest. it's the kind of support and friendship i need right now."
7320,Gabrielle,"well, who cares? the important thing is that he's safe, and we're gonna nurse you back to health, and i think that would happen a lot faster if we all clear out. thank you."
5329,Gabrielle,"you know what? i am tired of you judging me. what is it gonna take to get rid of you, hmm? what's your last name?"
5490,Gabrielle,so are we thinking this is paul?
6851,Gabrielle,"you could try, but you might not want to. see, i'm engaged to victor lang. ring a bell? the mayor? your new boss?"
4142,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no, i'm not going."
7759,Gabrielle,i mean it. this is it.
6672,Gabrielle,i just wanted a moment to say good-bye.
6419,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, stop by. we'll hot tub."
7972,Gabrielle,"well, i guess we're all going to the same place. i'll just see my friends there."
5466,Gabrielle,is there a problem?
4236,Gabrielle,hey! what's going on?
4683,Gabrielle,i don't think so.
7943,Gabrielle,i don't know. make an excuse. say you ha some blind thing you have to go to.
7540,Gabrielle,what was what?
5307,Gabrielle,"honey, are you okay?"
4397,Gabrielle,"well, i have a problem with you seeing other girls."
5848,Gabrielle,oh! okay.
6810,Gabrielle,"she will show you later! the point is, good friends share more than just gossip and brunch. they share enemies, too. so are you with me or not?"
4440,Gabrielle,"oh, for god's sakes, between you and carlos! listen to me carefully, you didn't do anything wrong."
5731,Gabrielle,"you know,that's your problem,carlos.remember when you bought your car? you paid sticker.nobody pays sticker!"
7743,Gabrielle,"first our money, then my figure, now the last shreds of our social standing."
6080,Gabrielle,you knew about carlos! my cheating was upfront and honest.
4337,Gabrielle,"okay, suit yourself."
8058,Gabrielle,you were blind and depressed. i didn't wanna add to it.
8192,Gabrielle,"jean, carlos is taking me to the palm, not out for hoagies. make it perfect."
6762,Gabrielle,is there anything i can do?
5342,Gabrielle,this is stupid. i didn't even want this baby.
7222,Gabrielle,"carlos, we were married. i was entitled to half of everything you embezzled."
5594,Gabrielle,mnh-mnh.hmm.
6132,Gabrielle,"lynette, you're not serious."
5436,Gabrielle,"really? oh, don't write that down. i wasn't being specific. he's allergic to fish eggs."
4538,Gabrielle,i'm going to kiss my husband now!
4880,Gabrielle,i bought shoes!
4971,Gabrielle,"he, uh-"
8548,Gabrielle,"because i'm an adult. and besides, i hardly wear any."
4270,Gabrielle,hi.
6450,Gabrielle,"carlos! carlos, wake up! i need you!"
4853,Gabrielle,obviously a few more.
8569,Gabrielle,"yeah, it doesn't really go with your skin tone either, but i can only deal with one disaster at a time. ooh. asian girl. close enough."
6468,Gabrielle,"wait, wait, wait. first rule of ransackingremember where everything goes."
7275,Gabrielle,where'd he go?
7123,Gabrielle,"honey, it's okay. you look cute in a scarf."
6752,Gabrielle,no! fifty thousand dollars? are you insane?!
4394,Gabrielle,so meet me at the motel in an hour? john?
4403,Gabrielle,"what? uh, yes, no, um, is that how she heard it?"
5460,Gabrielle,"oh, god, um, tom?"
7560,Gabrielle,"well, no offense. i just think bob has a better shot at pulling it off. he's a little more--"
4447,Gabrielle,that's good to hear.
6003,Gabrielle,"well, why don't you try putting on a pair of pants? that should kill a couple of hours."
8589,Gabrielle,who told you that?
7809,Gabrielle,that little weirdo is the key to you and i having more sex.
8348,Gabrielle,i guess.
6560,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so sweet, but i, uh--"
8092,Gabrielle,"hi, honey. you remember bradley and his wife maria. they dropped by for dinner."
7408,Gabrielle,carlos! i have a priest with me.
6437,Gabrielle,okay.
7746,Gabrielle,"now it's official. i've lost everything. first our money, then my figure, now the last shreds of our social standing."
7988,Gabrielle,"and, what, you're afraid it's gonna impair his vision? i'm sorry. you were saying-?"
6310,Gabrielle,i invited her to a party once.
7399,Gabrielle,"oh, that. yeah, i was a little blue, but the good news is, i've bounced back."
6646,Gabrielle,"i have noticed,and i'm throwing you back."
8377,Gabrielle,"hear about it? honey, i did it. i talked to carlos. you're in."
7714,Gabrielle,why not? you'd be massaging rich people. they tip better and they tend to flake less.
4605,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry. i, i'm so sorry, i just can't handle this right now. i have my own personal things going on. my life is falling apart."
5517,Gabrielle,"aw,you're so mean."
5326,Gabrielle,so what if it is?
7845,Gabrielle,"get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch!"
4831,Gabrielle,"i know baby, it hurts to lose."
7561,Gabrielle,"well, i really don't care who does it. just get it done. and--don't wear that."
6171,Gabrielle,"uh, hold it. you're a sweaty mess."
5247,Gabrielle,"no. you just agreed to an affair. a cheap, illicit affair with the woman you love? carlos would never share me. he's looking at eight years in prison because the mere thought of it sent him into a violent rage. that is love. this is, this is just lust, mixed with posttraumatic stress. i will see you in court tomorrow at ten a.m. and don't be late, or else i'll have you disbarred for sexual harassment."
8201,Gabrielle,"whatever. i used to be a model, and you don't know what war is until you've been in a dressing room with a bunch of size zeroes reaching for the last rice cake. i am plenty tough."
7995,Gabrielle,"thank you. god, what am i gonna do?"
5561,Gabrielle,there.i think we're all done here.
5366,Gabrielle,of course it did. everyone needs a strong male role model.
6348,Gabrielle,oh. it's nothing.
4168,Gabrielle,to mary alice.
7548,Gabrielle,"oh, right. i keep forgetting you're useless. i'm gonna see if ellie has one."
5299,Gabrielle,honey.
4470,Gabrielle,vaguely.
8535,Gabrielle,"so when he didn't see me, i found someone who did."
7541,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, ellie. there's been some tension between my husband and me. see, the truth is, we could've had the room rented by now if my husband wasn't so paranoid."
6585,Gabrielle,"i'm gonna take a little nap, okay?"
7126,Gabrielle,"okay, not smart."
5143,Gabrielle,what?
7651,Gabrielle,crap. ya had to play the daddy card.
5251,Gabrielle,not unless we make some.
7402,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no, no. it's carlos."
7442,Gabrielle,there you go. all gone.
4638,Gabrielle,because i said so.
6488,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. i just can't.
5362,Gabrielle,so pretty much just you.
7731,Gabrielle,"the bowmans. i found out mrs. bowman is home with the flu. score! oh, will you unclench? it'll be fine."
6960,Gabrielle,is this about running for governor? because i told you how i feel about that.
6207,Gabrielle,the whole divorce thing. maybe we shouldn't go through with it. it's not like we're gonna find this kind of passion with anyone else.
7474,Gabrielle,where the hell have you been?
8099,Gabrielle,"um, honey, bradley's right. you could take this job and do your charity work in your free time."
5642,Gabrielle,what was that for?
8034,Gabrielle,"i don't know. some italian guy. hey, mike's into baseball. he must know someone who can track down this lou gehrig guy and get him to sign a new one. what?"
7294,Gabrielle,you don't?
5912,Gabrielle,make me something strong.i have nine more holes with that guy.
5825,Gabrielle,what?
8427,Gabrielle,juanita! celia! get your coats on! we're going to see daddy.
6025,Gabrielle,"yes, i've been watching you make your new friend and it's disgusting!"
5761,Gabrielle,maybe.but we don't have to make it easy for them.
7873,Gabrielle,why the hell not?
7902,Gabrielle,no! he's giving her orgasms?!
4925,Gabrielle,yeah.
6031,Gabrielle,carlos! no!
5226,Gabrielle,of course you were.
8033,Gabrielle,"the car needed tires. how was i supposed to know he was gonna get his sight back? i mean, of all the rotten luck."
6702,Gabrielle,i had such a good time tonight. who knew you could dance?
8504,Gabrielle,"edna, here's your diet soda. try to keep your pants on."
7418,Gabrielle,"it's not a big deal. carlos is gonna get his sight back in three months. four, tops."
4949,Gabrielle,really? why?
8000,Gabrielle,"yes. not all fish is shaped like a stick. now i know you're not used to it, but give it a try. you're gonna love it. mmm. yummy."
8526,Gabrielle,"so i assume you fully disclosed your little ""friendship"" with patty rizzo."
8646,Gabrielle,"yeah, and knowing aunt connie, she's waited all these years to call that favor in. she's probably dying on purpose."
5399,Gabrielle,"well, i guess he should have thought of that before he married me."
8403,Gabrielle,"right. well, we'll create new table memoes."
8341,Gabrielle,"well, how many seconds did the kiss last?"
8207,Gabrielle,"shut up, mona. i'm puking air."
5378,Gabrielle,currently? no.
4828,Gabrielle,you have some nerve talking about trust when you have a secret bank account in the cayman islands.
6782,Gabrielle,"isn't he great? i know it's been quick, but he's just so amazing."
7087,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. i am done with your explanations, and i am done with just give me two more weeks, baby. whatever games you're playing, i'm sick of it. we're through."
6105,Gabrielle,why?
4535,Gabrielle,"oh, i, i moved all our stuff, to keep it from the feds."
5167,Gabrielle,"carlos, are we gonna make it?"
4847,Gabrielle,"because one day, when the time is right i'm gonna tell him how he drove me into your arms and that's going to kill him."
7664,Gabrielle,"carlos, are you almost ready? carlos? did you hear me?"
6124,Gabrielle,i don't. and i haven't for a very long time.
5660,Gabrielle,fine. we won't use it.
8373,Gabrielle,"juanita, you play with it every time we go by mrs. mccluskey's. now either tell me the truth, or i'm gonna cancel your birthday party."
7510,Gabrielle,no way. that mutt is not sleeping in our bed!
8496,Gabrielle,"oh, i'd kill for a margarita."
4589,Gabrielle,"uh, uh, uh! mmmm. mmmm. you're the man of the house? you can't even leave it!"
5986,Gabrielle,i have had to wait hand and foot on your mistress.i mean imagine if the day after you found out about john rowland you had to make his lunch and rub his feet!
6841,Gabrielle,"oh, this morning, i got in a fight with a parking cop over a ticket, and the guy was a total jerk."
7279,Gabrielle,maybe they won't.
4938,Gabrielle,i feel a wave of morning sickness coming on and i want to be standing on your mother's grave when it hits.
4331,Gabrielle,"yes, it's form-fitting. you're going to look great."
5078,Gabrielle,so are you gonna do it?
7963,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! that woman is crazy."
6760,Gabrielle,"you know, you're a single guy. maybe people won't care."
7672,Gabrielle,excuse me. susan!
4907,Gabrielle,i'm on the pill for god's sakes.
6709,Gabrielle,music. loud music.
4545,Gabrielle,don't you have a toilet to scrub?
4754,Gabrielle,i think that's pretty reasonable considering you're guilty as sin!
5122,Gabrielle,"oh, no, i am. yesterday, i was still fantasizing that it could work with you, that a one-bedroom apartment might be cozy."
5177,Gabrielle,what the hell are you doing?
5755,Gabrielle,"do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?!huh?well,come on,then."
5597,Gabrielle,"hmm, you like that?no.an old, fat stockbroker gave this to me.it's not worth anything.you can have it."
8490,Gabrielle,dave? hello? dave? he didn't answer.
6136,Gabrielle,carlos. no trishelle tonight?
7554,Gabrielle,"that was for the ""useless"" comment, wasn't it?"
4487,Gabrielle,"no, he doesn't adore me. he adores having me."
4975,Gabrielle,"well, uh, i had to, um, tell him some news that was a little bit upsetting for him."
7273,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm getting pretty good at that."
5024,Gabrielle,do you have any idea what you've done? that little stunt you pulled yesterday in the courtroom could get carlos sent away for eight years!
4572,Gabrielle,"but, how are you gonna work?"
8407,Gabrielle,mostly gossip. you got any good gossip?
5694,Gabrielle,"no! no, actually, all we think about when we look at you is how pretty you are."
6474,Gabrielle,is it?
5437,Gabrielle,poor baby's gone his whole life without caviar. now that's suffering.
5497,Gabrielle,"oh,i'm sorry.i didn't know you and bonita were having problems."
4646,Gabrielle,people keep coming and talking to me asking me questions. that is not my job.
7648,Gabrielle,"ellie, you can't call me! the cops are all over my ass because they think i helped you escape."
4869,Gabrielle,what's this?
5123,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. i almost left my husband for someone who calls me mrs. solis."
4790,Gabrielle,"well, that's a ridiculous thing to say. i'm not going anywhere."
5396,Gabrielle,"oh, good. good. so it would really help our marriage if you just backed off for a while, okay?"
7922,Gabrielle,thank you.
8432,Gabrielle,"i know you can't, and that's the part that really scares me."
8599,Gabrielle,"me either. my daughter's gotten so snooty, i am forcing her to spend time with the great unwashed. you wanna ditch this place for a cappuccino?"
8350,Gabrielle,"you're putting me in a tough spot. carlos is under a lot of pressure now, and he's not really in a position to be taking big risks."
6276,Gabrielle,"marcella, look, i don't know what they told you, but all i'm asking for is a simple costume change."
6576,Gabrielle,"what is with you?! an hour ago, you we really into me, and now you can't get out fast enough."
5220,Gabrielle,"well, you protected me from a hail of gun fire, so i thought i'd stop by and give you a card."
6357,Gabrielle,orson was slipping it to the dead chick?
5740,Gabrielle,"well,i'm siding with bree."
6428,Gabrielle,i know. so just admit you sent the flowers.
4668,Gabrielle,"that's very generous of you, but i don't think so."
6184,Gabrielle,i'm just gonna say it. tequila makes me happy.
8337,Gabrielle,"anyway, juanita went over before breakfast to invite m.j. to her birthday party, and, well, candy plus juanita. you don't have to be sherlock holmes to crack this case."
5300,Gabrielle,"no, i'm good."
6839,Gabrielle,thank you. your husband runs a hell of a campaign.
4467,Gabrielle,"believe me, it's been my pleasure. how's he doing?"
8410,Gabrielle,"well, i am so pissed at carlos. he is never home. and when he is, he's too tired to do anything. and by ""anything,"" i mean sex. are you uncomfortable?"
8461,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, i have a vodka soda here that says otherwise."
8424,Gabrielle,"tight, just the way i like it."
7833,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. way out."
5474,Gabrielle,it was a harmless little kiss!why is everybody making a big deal about this?
7859,Gabrielle,"yeah, we're up to two miracles, and if you come back from the dead after i kill you, it'll be three."
5049,Gabrielle,do you know how long it takes me to schlep out here to this hellhole?
5874,Gabrielle,carlos! her boobs are none of your business.
8194,Gabrielle,"no, not that story. something about a boot camp."
6772,Gabrielle,the only reason he didn't tell you was because he was protecting me.
8301,Gabrielle,"oh, no. she does. she loves him plenty."
8540,Gabrielle,was his name carlos solis?
4155,Gabrielle,i do.
8037,Gabrielle,"oh, please. this is important."
7712,Gabrielle,"he's got a bum hip. he's also missing a testicle. carlos, how much more of this am i supposed to take?"
5115,Gabrielle,"i know you're friends, and i have a hunch you don't do to your friends what i saw you doing to that wrinkly old lady."
4130,Gabrielle,the police.they called me.
7937,Gabrielle,"rise and shine, girls. rise and shi--oh, my god! what are you doing?!"
7180,Gabrielle,awfully pregnant.
7036,Gabrielle,"carlos! he's at your house. oh, he just let himself in. there you go. he's home."
7314,Gabrielle,"well, you can stop feeling guilty. victor's alive, and we're screwed."
7192,Gabrielle,"oh, let it go! john rowland didn't do anything to you that you're not doing to victor."
7683,Gabrielle,"my daughter does not have a weight problem. she has a little baby fat, that's all. in fact, the only problem she has is this store being completely unprepared for a perfectly average 4-year-old girl. just ring it up."
8648,Gabrielle,why would i be nervous?
6507,Gabrielle,no. absolutely not.
7719,Gabrielle,"i heard. i can't wait. ooh, i was gonna ask you should i wear the navy blue chanel or the red sleeveless dress?"
6264,Gabrielle,"you must be tanya. i'm gabrielle. we're gonna be co-models today. now i don't know if you've ever done one of these big shoots before, but don't be nervous. durkin and i are old friends. he's a sweetheart. now just remember, he's the king, do exactly what he says, and you'll be fine."
5967,Gabrielle,"tell it to my chinese friend, sue me!!"
5972,Gabrielle,"oh my god, you're serious?no sex at all? no even-- um--"
7449,Gabrielle,"ooh, i say we nominate the woman who gives edie her bikini wax."
6748,Gabrielle,he's not here. is that for him?
4824,Gabrielle,"so what do you expect to happen right now, carlos? i sign the papers and jump into your arms."
7794,Gabrielle,maybe you're right.
8539,Gabrielle,"yeah. there's gonna be a huge dinner, and we're taking a picture with the mayor and his wife."
8325,Gabrielle,i guess bradley told her.
7362,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i'm a mess-- you know, on the inside, where the mascara can't run."
4252,Gabrielle,"oh my god, when did this happen?"
6472,Gabrielle,fine. why does julie have a vcr?
6389,Gabrielle,what do you mean you live there? since when?
7814,Gabrielle,"okay, i dropped off celia at preschool, and juanita's at her playdate. drop trou."
7173,Gabrielle,because i want to feel pretty and feminine. ooh! my chili cheese fries! just a second!
6979,Gabrielle,"i don't know and i don't care. today, i'm so filled with love, i can forgive anyone anything. oh, um, but if you do see them again, call security."
4358,Gabrielle,of course you do.
7729,Gabrielle,really? we'd love to.
6880,Gabrielle,"oh, i see you got the invitation!"
5359,Gabrielle,wait! i'm not done with you yet.
6038,Gabrielle,what were you thinking setting carlos up with that skank?!
6240,Gabrielle,"i keep thinking about that crazy lady in the market, and--i understand her. i could be her."
7520,Gabrielle,"shame, isn't it? i mean, i personally adored the little angel, but she and carlos just did not get along."
4626,Gabrielle,"i don't know. you know, every once in a while, even i want to do the right thing."
6110,Gabrielle,you peed in my shampoo. admit it!
6384,Gabrielle,"yes, keep it coming."
8183,Gabrielle,"the palm? as in, ""they don't even show the prices on the menu"" the palm? honey, we're still paying off credit card debt."
8279,Gabrielle,come on in.
8458,Gabrielle,"hmm. yes, i guess i am a little on the small side. that's the drawback to having ones that are real."
7430,Gabrielle,"ooh, i meant to move that. hang on. let me just pull my panties up so i can help you. okay. here. let's go do it over here."
5678,Gabrielle,"there are ways to get babies, carlos."
8456,Gabrielle,"oh, edie, don't take it personally. we're just different types."
6887,Gabrielle,"oh, what, now you suddenly have the trademark on peach tulips?"
7669,Gabrielle,"aah! carlos! carlos, don't just stand there! go get help!"
7147,Gabrielle,all quiet on the southern front.
6604,Gabrielle,"i am in hell.i just tried to break up with zach,and the little twerp played the dead mommy card."
4479,Gabrielle,really?
5089,Gabrielle,"we are both controlled by our husbands, which is idiotic because they're both behind bars. we should have all the power."
7175,Gabrielle,"but just to be safe, you may wanna hide in the closet."
7901,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa. nobody used the ""o"" word."
5958,Gabrielle,not to sleep with a woman carrying on a child.
5311,Gabrielle,i'm gonna call the police!
8128,Gabrielle,"okay, juanita. what is going on here? why are you being so difficult? when daddy asks you to do something, you just do it."
7272,Gabrielle,"aah! victor! oh, my god! victor! oh! oh, my god!"
5804,Gabrielle,"look, i think we all know that karl is a dog.mm.i mean, but let's face it--if these tramps weren't laying out the buffet,he wouldn't be chowing down."
7652,Gabrielle,hmm.
4220,Gabrielle,i really hate the way you talk to me.
7185,Gabrielle,"yeah, good times. anyways, uh, that's a negatory on the affair--"
5020,Gabrielle,stop it!
8629,Gabrielle,"well, then you have no choice. bite the bullet and be bitch."
7624,Gabrielle,wow. interesting.
6187,Gabrielle,what do you think their secret is?
8594,Gabrielle,"well, you should've thought about that before you started acting like such a diva. now sit down. father crowley!"
6122,Gabrielle,"wow, you are crazy."
7971,Gabrielle,"well, here's the thing. i'm supposed to go with my girlfriends."
5455,Gabrielle,you make it sound like--i was making a pass at your husband.and that's just a little bit insulting.
5239,Gabrielle,"and you know what? a lesser woman would let you rot in here, but i'm not gonna do that. i'm not gonna give you the satisfaction. so you better start packing up your shanks or whatever you people make in here, because you're coming home with me!"
8244,Gabrielle,like a great jumping off point.
7608,Gabrielle,"well, how long is that gonna take?"
5677,Gabrielle,"$20,000.is that proof enough for you?"
8246,Gabrielle,"oh, brad. come on. saving a marriage? you can't put a price on that--at least not a small one."
5404,Gabrielle,you do not want to start a war with me.
6901,Gabrielle,"me, too, and i'm so sorry about that comment i made about mike. it was way out of line. you guys are gonna be insanely happy."
6771,Gabrielle,"the only reason victor kept it from you was to protect me because he's the kind of man who puts a woman's honor before his own, and that's the kind of man you marry. that's the kind of man you vote for."
4791,Gabrielle,yeah. of course.
6288,Gabrielle,"don't call me a bi*ch, and stop tracking my cycle. i told you that freaks me out."
6790,Gabrielle,what kind of woman would keep her husband's body in the freezer?
4442,Gabrielle,have you lost your mind? what did you tell him?
8425,Gabrielle,"carlos, where you going?"
5942,Gabrielle,oh. i seriously doubt that.
7425,Gabrielle,skip straight to dessert?
6244,Gabrielle,okay.
7016,Gabrielle,yeah?prove it.
8483,Gabrielle,"actually, that's my leg. get your hand off."
8022,Gabrielle,you know when i decided i wanna be with you forever?
5491,Gabrielle,#name?
8003,Gabrielle,"okay, look. mommy needs to lose a few pounds, and it's not easy eating healthy with you two in front of me, scarfing down all the good stuff. so what do you say? you want to help mommy be beautiful again?"
8474,Gabrielle,now come on. let's go to my house. let's pop open a bottle of wine and toast to our future.
5294,Gabrielle,"i just, i have so many errands to run and a million thing to return."
7428,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm sorry. i forgot that was open. let's do it over here, on the table."
5467,Gabrielle,really? because i sense that you're annoyed you found me here when you weren't home. am i wrong?
8578,Gabrielle,"yes, i was. and my whole life, people told me how pretty i was. so you know what? i never--thought i had to work hard in school or work on friendships or my personality--none of it. and then i stopped modeling, and i realized i didn't have much on the inside. and i don't want that for you. i want you to be brave and funny and creative--to be more than just a shell. i want you to have the whole rich, gooey center. will you promise to do that for yourself?"
8144,Gabrielle,"you never buy me a present unless i'm mad or about to be mad. and i don't think i am, so why am i about to be?"
4190,Gabrielle,is that white gold?
5025,Gabrielle,you brought luggage?
6480,Gabrielle,you got a little chocolate on your shirt.
6493,Gabrielle,you son of a bi*ch. you were there?
4336,Gabrielle,"mama solis, carlos is going to be late home for dinner. it's just the two of us.what would you like to eat?"
8469,Gabrielle,"oh, please. you're gorgeous. and you are going to stay that way forever."
5282,Gabrielle,"well, allison's mad because she's losing jobs to fourteen-year-olds, holly is on a strict diet of cruciferous vegetables, and yasmin is undergoing a new embryonic facial treatment that probably causes short-term memory loss. you know, i just stood there the whole night trying to remember why we were ever friends. and i couldn't."
8152,Gabrielle,"yeah. they came by, brought muffins. one of 'em wants her basket back."
8169,Gabrielle,"playing poker, and i wasn't invited. i know. i get it. i just wanted to tell you guys i know i made a horrible first impression. now you know why models don't usually talk. because we say a lot of stupid, patronizing things that make people want to avoid us. what i should've said was--my husband's never home. i miss the city. i miss my life. i'm lonely all the time--and i could really use some friends. anyway, here."
4999,Gabrielle,"am i supposed to be impressed? because of your little stunt with my birth control pills, i've lost my freedom for the next eighteen years."
7360,Gabrielle,aah! it's here.
7906,Gabrielle,"i am gabrielle solis. perhaps you know my husband? he ""rubs"" your boss. where are they?"
7770,Gabrielle,"okay, you know what? that's it. i wanna talk to your mother."
8363,Gabrielle,so don't get me wrong--she's attractive. it's just-- she's not really your type. your type is skinny model.
5456,Gabrielle,you see?
5768,Gabrielle,"my husband,the comedian."
8613,Gabrielle,"i feel bad i ducked out so fast the other day. and i've been thinking about you a lot, and i just-- i really wanna help."
5019,Gabrielle,aaah. carlos!
7183,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't think we need to get into that."
6750,Gabrielle,do i look like the maid? give me that!
5461,Gabrielle,"uh, i think she got sick."
6776,Gabrielle,yep. she's on the top of a swiss alp and still managed to send a basket of muffins.
6429,Gabrielle,"carlos, just tell me. i won't be mad.i promise."
8431,Gabrielle,"you're right, and i'm sorry. it's just--i'm scared. we're turning into what we used to be. i'm unhappy at home, you're always working, trying to buy me off with presents, too tired to make me feel loved. we've made these mistakes before, carlos. for god sakes, let's not make 'em again."
7464,Gabrielle,hang it up!
5292,Gabrielle,thanks. thanks for understanding.
7657,Gabrielle,hello?
7421,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no. this can't be true."
4321,Gabrielle,dammit! the virgin gave it up already?
7490,Gabrielle,"bree, what's up? i thought giving out this award was your thing."
5965,Gabrielle,"i am the meanest person.you've been in the country a year.modify your nouns, damn it."
6483,Gabrielle,"well, john rowland was a mistake. i was lonely."
8669,Gabrielle,"well, how did you get everything down so quickly?"
8658,Gabrielle,"no, i'm just kidding. it was a joke."
6650,Gabrielle,he's married.
5732,Gabrielle,"i'm thinking $12,000."
5889,Gabrielle,it's right down the hall.
7679,Gabrielle,"oh, i think we're gonna need the next size up."
6256,Gabrielle,"you look great.well, apparently, taking a .38 slug to the shoulder agrees with you."
8251,Gabrielle,so--what's going on? i'm gonna buy a golf club. a baseball bat would be cheaper. maybe i should let you finish.
4767,Gabrielle,"oh, that's so thoughtful of you, but actually no."
8416,Gabrielle,"yeah, i should get back."
7775,Gabrielle,that m.j.'s getting beat up by a little girl.
5453,Gabrielle,"you know,we were just having fun,entertaining the crowd."
7976,Gabrielle,"no, i want them to be close by. they could need me during the school day-- get sick or something."
4644,Gabrielle,"very impressive. so, where does the photographer want me for the shoot?"
6296,Gabrielle,"good comparison, because it's gonna take a miracle to turn these mutts into show dogs."
6981,Gabrielle,"no, i'm still looking, but i'll let you know."
4723,Gabrielle,"obviously, someone who's not getting it at home."
6230,Gabrielle,"come on, just give me one clean shot at him. i'm willing to do the time!"
6821,Gabrielle,"stop it! carlos, put me down! how dare you maul me like that!"
5125,Gabrielle,"actually, john, given how stupid both of us have been, this an entirely appropriate ending."
4492,Gabrielle,some work emergency. he wouldn't talk about it. sometimes i could just kill him.
7493,Gabrielle,"ah, nice to meet you. carlos told me how much he enjoyed taking classes with roxy."
8104,Gabrielle,you know what would lift your spirits? we should all do a spa weekend.
7260,Gabrielle,"okay. i am so sorry. but in my defense, you were always gone, and you knew how needy i was when you married me."
5806,Gabrielle,"she's never too young to start accessorizing.besides, all the neighbors are out today,and i want them to see how happy we are and wish they were us."
7802,Gabrielle,"luckily, i'm insured. oh, wait. our policy lapsed. hope you've got good coverage."
6257,Gabrielle,"you look amazing, younger than ever!"
6331,Gabrielle,"getting there, sweetie. if she was a horse, we'd have to shoot her."
8472,Gabrielle,you do realize there's medication designed to get rid of those voices?
6578,Gabrielle,what?
7494,Gabrielle,"well, i have got a million questions about this little lifesaver here."
4490,Gabrielle,"susan mayer saw us last night, and she knows everything."
7383,Gabrielle,so i was shocked to hear about al. i can't remember the last time i was so devastated.
6459,Gabrielle,"that's very sweet of you, but i am not the most beautiful woman in the world."
6845,Gabrielle,my city. it's like i'm seeing it for the first time. everything looks different now that i'm first lady of fairview.
4162,Gabrielle,"i'm not feeling the grass! let's just get going, come on! we're late!"
4135,Gabrielle,"i'm telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation."
4707,Gabrielle,exactly.
8552,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. your daddy's just being silly. can i talk to you for a second, silly daddy?"
6655,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
8389,Gabrielle,that son of a--i'm gonna kill him!
7047,Gabrielle,wow.
5951,Gabrielle,good.i have a little project for you.
8476,Gabrielle,pfft.
4262,Gabrielle,i love taking baths. especially with you. it's like taking a vacation from the world.
4187,Gabrielle,i know you're a jerk.
7164,Gabrielle,h-hi. look at you. what a surprise.
6592,Gabrielle,"oh, god. here it comes."
5711,Gabrielle,so is that what it's gonna take to change your mind--a gift?fine. what do you want?
4898,Gabrielle,"oh, i would love to have this in my driveway by saturday. i'm having a big barbeque and i want everyone to see it."
7365,Gabrielle,"well, i guess there's nothing disrespectful about a ballpark figure."
5772,Gabrielle,"we have the money. what is wrong with getting a little help?then i'll be able to relax once in a while,and i'll be able to be a better mother."
7552,Gabrielle,"okay, that was weird."
5101,Gabrielle,you are clearly determined to ruin this special day for us.
4327,Gabrielle,i don't know. how do you usually manipulate rex?
4617,Gabrielle,"obviously, i'm not leaving my husband and marrying john."
6326,Gabrielle,"no, it's true. you have husbands and families and a reason to wake up in the morning. what do i have? him. teaching your kids about confidence and beauty is the most useful thing i've done since--i don't know when. and as much as i've helped them-- they've helped me so much more. so please, i need this. and i promise, no more talk about dodgy weight loss methods. like the highly effective, non-f.d.a. approved diet pill i can get from my friends in zurich--in bulk."
7193,Gabrielle,"is it, mr. man in the closet? yeah, you heard me. who's john rowland now?"
4239,Gabrielle,"wow, aren't you the little artist. what are those, flamingos?"
5274,Gabrielle,"well, i'm not saying i'm not gonna grow attached to the little bugger. i just don't have the motherhood gene. i wish i did, but i don't. what?"
5074,Gabrielle,excuse me?
8249,Gabrielle,hey.
4414,Gabrielle,okay. take good care of carlos.
7429,Gabrielle,"can't. my legs are in the air. just follow the sound of my voice. there you go. i'm over here, sweetie."
4724,Gabrielle,i'm all in.
4311,Gabrielle,i'm getting something to drink. do you want something?
6822,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. betrayal makes me a little cranky.
7088,Gabrielle,"you think victor's my only option? well,igot news for you, carlos. i can have any guy i want, because this--waits for no man."
7750,Gabrielle,"god, isn't there any way we can keep it? i mean, this car's the last thing i have that tells the world, ""i'm better than you."""
8271,Gabrielle,the federal deficit.
4653,Gabrielle,"oh, god."
4667,Gabrielle,you want to mow my lawn for free?
5148,Gabrielle,only if it ends with me getting what i want.
5228,Gabrielle,"sure. now, open up."
6804,Gabrielle,you're about to find out.
7790,Gabrielle,"well, if it's any consolation, carlos is a hands-on, full-time dad, and i still feel like i'm not getting the job done, like--i'm not preparing them enough."
8627,Gabrielle,"as in ""moo goo gai pan"" chinese?"
6805,Gabrielle,so here's what's gonna happen-- we're not talking to edie anymore.
6619,Gabrielle,"i want you to leave me alone! this friends thing isn't gonna work 'cause you're always gonna want more, and i'm never gonna love you-- ever."
6170,Gabrielle,okay.
6583,Gabrielle,"ah, that's so sweet--but it's a lie. every tick of the clock takes away something. zach, what am i gonna do when i'm not pretty anymore?"
7059,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. it's just hospitals are hard for me.
5554,Gabrielle,"ah,vatican politics.what's wrong?"
4176,Gabrielle,what's that?
6047,Gabrielle,how could this have happened? what kind of half-ass fertility clinic are you running?
6779,Gabrielle,a poem?
6165,Gabrielle,but you're bringing me breakfast in bed or no deal.
8318,Gabrielle,shayla? she has a hello kitty tip jar.
5991,Gabrielle,"uh, sure, who doesn't love a string quartet. but if you got a band, maybe people could dance as opposed to sway."
6343,Gabrielle,great! it's a date.
5580,Gabrielle,"when he turns our house into a catholic underground railroad, yes!"
5760,Gabrielle,here.we're good to go.give me the baby.
8127,Gabrielle,i've had enough of your crap. now pick up these toys!
8604,Gabrielle,"can you believe this? seven years ago, evelyn did fran's house. now? nohouse."
5077,Gabrielle,"uh, no. no. you, you seem to have everything you need."
6265,Gabrielle,"well, i guess you're all set then."
8146,Gabrielle,you just got home!
8453,Gabrielle,too much?
4404,Gabrielle,i just wanted to help out.
7245,Gabrielle,i thought you kept your boat at the yacht club.
4922,Gabrielle,thanks.
6400,Gabrielle,that's sweet that you're not jealous. carlos would've hit the roof if some guy sent me--would you excuse me a minute?
7065,Gabrielle,"well, don't get sappy on me. i won't stand for it. all right. susan, is the camera ready?"
5635,Gabrielle,"maybe,but you don't know her like i do."
8538,Gabrielle,"oh, i hate splitting the pot."
5258,Gabrielle,"because i wear a double zero, you twerp!"
8085,Gabrielle,"it was tom scavo, wasn't it?"
7666,Gabrielle,what?!
6663,Gabrielle,"oh, shut up and get me a sweater. have you even noticed how cold i am?"
6933,Gabrielle,"i do, too."
8320,Gabrielle,what you reading?
6191,Gabrielle,"nah, i already paid a lawyer. i'm taking him down."
5845,Gabrielle,"all right.look,my friends wanna take some of this to go,so pack it up,and we're a little low on coffee."
8541,Gabrielle,"juanita, hurry up. the bus will be here any minute."
8153,Gabrielle,hello there. welcome to my home.
6697,Gabrielle,"i've known you for two weeks, and this is the first glimpse of a guy i could actually like."
5325,Gabrielle,"why is everyone on my back about this? i will deal with my loss my way, okay?"
4758,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry, carlos."
8527,Gabrielle,exactly.
5922,Gabrielle,"oh! no, no. i was-- just changing out of my sweaty clothes.i didn't realize moving was such great cardio"
4292,Gabrielle,so why weren't you sitting with mike tonight? i thought you two were becoming an item.
7953,Gabrielle,in three days. that's the creepy part.
6432,Gabrielle,so you are dating. that's why you've been lifting weights and jogging.
5953,Gabrielle,"i had a reason to. you were never here! i've been here, carlos.i have tried so hard to not be selfish and to put your needs above mine.i mean, for god sakes, look at me!i have agreed to be a mother for you!"
4468,Gabrielle,i hear he's dating danielle van de kamp?
7502,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, when she learns how to make granite sparkle, she can have more."
7463,Gabrielle,no! you started it. hang it up!
4613,Gabrielle,"john, what opportunity is more important than college?"
4454,Gabrielle,what i want is to be happy.
6436,Gabrielle,"hey, guys--"
7325,Gabrielle,carlos and i are back together.
6279,Gabrielle,i don't believe that.
5720,Gabrielle,so why put me through this?
8390,Gabrielle,"how dare you! and, yes, i did!"
5662,Gabrielle,"well,then we'll just have to find someone who can do it for us."
6514,Gabrielle,"gee, well--not as wild as what i'm about to say. you can take me to dinner."
7223,Gabrielle,"well, it matters that you lied to me. i can't trust you."
4704,Gabrielle,"then what? huh? finish the sentence, carlos. we've tons of legal bills, you've lost all your clients and even with our savings, we're screwed."
5147,Gabrielle,why does everybody have a problem with me having sex with my husband?
7046,Gabrielle,"oh, come on. let's dig into the pie. looks amazing."
4163,Gabrielle,"oh, excuse me."
7330,Gabrielle,yeah. this afternoon.
6510,Gabrielle,"susan, do you know what your obsession with mike has cost you? first you piss off bree and then ian, and now you're pimping me out to a teenager!"
5272,Gabrielle,what?
7796,Gabrielle,so?! there's waffles in the freezer! and get mommy some ice!
7033,Gabrielle,edie! what brings you here?
8120,Gabrielle,"all right, that's it! i'm calling your father! you are gonna get it now! he is gonna tear into you! it is gonna be a bloodbath!"
7291,Gabrielle,"oh, no. they did?"
7034,Gabrielle,sorry. haven't seen him.
6990,Gabrielle,i was--just counting gifts.
5435,Gabrielle,"honey, he's going to a remote village in africa. does it really matter that he's allergic to eggs?"
5544,Gabrielle,"oh, um, i'm looking for father crowley.do you know where he is?"
6773,Gabrielle,"in a few months, i will be mrs. victor lang."
7462,Gabrielle,like hell i am! give me that.
7051,Gabrielle,"well, it just seemed like people had it pretty well covered."
5581,Gabrielle,"well, they should've called ahead."
5882,Gabrielle,why in the hell?
4806,Gabrielle,"most men would leave over something like that, and you're still here. i'm grateful. i know the sacrifice you're making."
4213,Gabrielle,"oh, john gave it to me."
5087,Gabrielle,"well, i do think it's silly to give someone seven thousand dollars if they don't want it."
6112,Gabrielle,"to answer your question, no, we are not getting back together."
4540,Gabrielle,"she's a talented girl, our edie."
5389,Gabrielle,really?
6347,Gabrielle,"aw, that's sweet."
6557,Gabrielle,oh. you know my friend zach?
5870,Gabrielle,"no, no, xiao-mei,i've told you a million times.no red meat for mr. solis."
4877,Gabrielle,it's me.
7847,Gabrielle,"uh, well, mommy has a friend who visits her every month, and she's late, and that's bad."
8357,Gabrielle,"well, you can beg all you want. i am not on board with this!"
7760,Gabrielle,"fine. okay, fine. knock off $200, and we'll give you cash."
5213,Gabrielle,are you okay?
4371,Gabrielle,it turns out your mother is quite the card shark.
5044,Gabrielle,me too. look on the bright side. at least we're still rich.
8682,Gabrielle,hey.
8459,Gabrielle,"oh, edie, come on. when you jump up and down, the room moves more than your boobs."
4523,Gabrielle,"yao lin, don't be stupid. people don't become poor overnight."
5264,Gabrielle,"well, try harder."
8381,Gabrielle,"yeah. yes, and then i went home and ought, what a horrible thing to say to such a dear, dear friend who's probably really, really good at her job. so--i said, ""carlos, you have to hire lynette."""
4503,Gabrielle,"susan, don't be like this!"
8523,Gabrielle,"although i keep telling tom how dangerous gardens can be. everywhere you step, there are shovels and rakes and hoes."
6980,Gabrielle,"oh, my gosh, that's right. okay, you stay here. i'm gonna go grab him."
4662,Gabrielle,"but, we will do whatever you want us to do."
4576,Gabrielle,"yeah, but this is different. someone was actually murdered on our street."
6222,Gabrielle,keep talking.
5977,Gabrielle,i did not lose our baby.stop saying that!i know exactly where it is!inside some crazy chinese woman!who also stole half a chicken from my fridge!
4984,Gabrielle,"i just want to say goodbye, because i'm leaving you."
8159,Gabrielle,"no, no, it's cute. it's cute. i get that. it's just-- i was a top-tier fashion model, and i guess i'm just gonna have to get used to the fact that the best part of my life is behind me. good-bye doi vod shots with kate moss, and hello to sipping international coffee with you girls. full house."
8466,Gabrielle,"what the hell were you thinking, abandoning me at a singles bar?"
6508,Gabrielle,i don't care. i'm not going out with zach young!
7585,Gabrielle,you're spoiling him.
6807,Gabrielle,"i can't believe you're not furious at this. before she sank her fangs into carlos, she was dating your ex-husband and mike."
6069,Gabrielle,"so i guess, uh, there's no chance of getting you over to the house to pick the dead leaves off my ficus."
6639,Gabrielle,"victor, you are so full of crap."
4693,Gabrielle,why?
4232,Gabrielle,if you would. please.
5877,Gabrielle,absolutely. you have nothing to worry about here.
8371,Gabrielle,no. why would you think that?
6715,Gabrielle,we had sex yesterday in his limo.
4993,Gabrielle,i just left my husband.
6661,Gabrielle,boring.
5280,Gabrielle,"hi. my, uh, friends just left, and i was hoping you could come over and cut me out of this thing."
7717,Gabrielle,thank you.
6542,Gabrielle,sure. why not?
5705,Gabrielle,"well,that's different."
7146,Gabrielle,yep.
8014,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, let's keep our fingers crossed. ow!"
6716,Gabrielle,"well, stretch, of course. i'm not a complete slut. point is, he hasn't called since."
6618,Gabrielle,i did not say to humiliate me!
8186,Gabrielle,have you not noticed me working my butt off? i'm almost back to the weight i was when we got married!
6411,Gabrielle,hi. i received some flowers from your shop yesterday and the card didn't say who they were from. can you check the name is solis.
7441,Gabrielle,i did.
4379,Gabrielle,hi john. motel. ten minutes. be there.
4201,Gabrielle,"no, no, no, i'm not dumping you. lately, you're been the only thing keeping me going. it's just, we can't do it at my house anymore."
7025,Gabrielle,you're right. i'm not happy.let's talk.all i'm saying is i just wanna know that i come first with you.sometimes i feel less like your wife than a possession.it's demeaning.it's--it's--why are you smiling right now?
5864,Gabrielle,"honey,come on.we're gonna be late."
7658,Gabrielle,"oh. right. the bear. well-- i looked all over and just couldn't find it. i guess the cops took it. i'm really sorry, ellie. i know it was a gift from your dad. it just breaks my heart."
5915,Gabrielle,"oh, honey!oh, you're not dead!"
4166,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry about edie. she's a strong lady."
8645,Gabrielle,"no, i'm thinking about our children. they're so happy. taking in a kid we don't even know? that's a huge risk."
8300,Gabrielle,"yeah, that's what i thought at first, and then i realized that's stupid. i mean, what about his poor wife?"
6849,Gabrielle,just stand back and enjoy the carnage.
8452,Gabrielle,and susan?
6162,Gabrielle,"well, then enlighten me. how can i hit you so hard that you will never recover?"
4924,Gabrielle,yeah.
7663,Gabrielle,"yes, officer. i see you. thank you for coming. now remember, ellie's dangerous. so if she shows up, feel free to use excessive force."
5010,Gabrielle,"well, i'm about to be the mother of your child, which means a lot of responsibility and little time for myself. so if i'm gonna get you out of this mess, you have to reciprocate."
6778,Gabrielle,"wait, wait. you're not gonna embarrass me with some sappy toast, are you?"
4435,Gabrielle,"i know, i've been watching. i came to talk to you."
5894,Gabrielle,"yeah, in a twin?good luck.god, i want my bed back."
6666,Gabrielle,look at this! there's lacroix and ungaro and vintage gaultier.
4369,Gabrielle,hey! so what did i miss?
4621,Gabrielle,"that's sweet, you're, you're very sweet."
7830,Gabrielle,excuse me?
7318,Gabrielle,"really? i mean, what?"
6150,Gabrielle,yes! yes!
7241,Gabrielle,that's so romantic. i love that.
4153,Gabrielle,yes.
7868,Gabrielle,"my period's late, and that never happens to me. i'm like a swiss clock."
6349,Gabrielle,"yeah, she's a special girl."
5998,Gabrielle,there was a time you thought i belonged in your family. and you got over that!
7177,Gabrielle,"john, what are you doing here?"
4948,Gabrielle,john! what are you doing?
4765,Gabrielle,"carlos, we're not exactly flush with cash right now. let her be true to her roots. she was born humble and barefoot."
6283,Gabrielle,"yeah, me, too."
4624,Gabrielle,how? you're barely making minimum wage!
6605,Gabrielle,but i am guilty. i don't remember how we ended up in bed together. maybe i led him on. i gotta be sensitive here. could you threaten him for me?
5961,Gabrielle,you did not just to that!
5345,Gabrielle,"and a girl, aurora."
8294,Gabrielle,or we can--make someone else do the right thing.
4231,Gabrielle,"well, get here as fast as you can. my husband says i need to relax."
8164,Gabrielle,what?
4494,Gabrielle,"edie, what did you do to that dress?"
7530,Gabrielle,"come on, you stupid mutt."
4491,Gabrielle,"thank god, tom could fill in at the last minute."
8525,Gabrielle,"lynette was taking a shower and carlos came by to drive her to work. she slipped and fell, and he helped her."
4316,Gabrielle,you can't be serious.
4188,Gabrielle,"you know, carlos, i didn't marry you so i could have dinner by myself 6 nights a week. you know how bored i was today? i came this close to actually cleaning the house."
4471,Gabrielle,i don't know what his problem is. he's making money left and right. i just wish he'd relax.
6476,Gabrielle,"zach young! oh, my god! it's been ages. wow. look at you! so handsome in a suit."
4778,Gabrielle,what is that?
7296,Gabrielle,"okay, this is no time for name-calling. a man is missing."
5175,Gabrielle,he's quite the shark. you're gonna love him. he hasn't lost a case in six years. he argued in front of the state supreme court and he made our conjugal visit happen pretty damn fast.
4719,Gabrielle,it's definitely on the short list.
8265,Gabrielle,"oh, whoa."
5583,Gabrielle,"no, this is couture!this rip has to be fixed by an experienced tailor.you can't just--holy crap!this stitching is perfect!"
8681,Gabrielle,welcome home.
6287,Gabrielle,"vern, i worked the catwalks in milan and paris. i'm not gonna give makeup tips to little miss training bra."
5640,Gabrielle,so? how did it go?
7348,Gabrielle,aah!
5184,Gabrielle,oh my god. you fired him because you're jealous?
5866,Gabrielle,"well,honey,she's a virgin.who knows why virgins do anything?"
5966,Gabrielle,"i can't wait for you to pop out that baby because when you do i am putting you on the first plane back to shanghai, and you're going to be on all fours in a rice patty before the epidural wears off!"
7817,Gabrielle,"sex as a blind man. i mean, you used to be so visual. is it still as good?"
4345,Gabrielle,"thank you, yoa lin."
8063,Gabrielle,what?
7586,Gabrielle,"what the hell? ellie, your door is locked! ellie! oh, shut up already."
7787,Gabrielle,"well, what do you expect?"
5938,Gabrielle,"oh, no.no, i mean, i guess it was, well, weird when you started naming the american presidents in order."
8450,Gabrielle,how about bree?
4525,Gabrielle,hey! hey! what are you doing? where are you taking my car?
5859,Gabrielle,"are you kidding?no one cares about virginity in this country.it went out of style in the '50s,and trust me,honey,it ain't making a comeback.seriously,no one cares."
6416,Gabrielle,"you're right,and i am so sorry for taking up so much of your time."
8139,Gabrielle,really?
4757,Gabrielle,"ah, thank you, yes."
6037,Gabrielle,"oh for god's sake, what?"
5221,Gabrielle,"what do you mean, i'm your first visitor? you've been here two days."
8328,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, i have a feeling most of these vultures didn't come to pay their respects to brad. they're just here to pump us for dirt about his murder."
5962,Gabrielle,pick it up!
5092,Gabrielle,"see, i was thinking i'd be writing the checks."
8487,Gabrielle,"okay, i got one. i'll go first. edie britt was sexy."
4583,Gabrielle,"maybe. but having a baby, that, i can control. you, i can control."
7613,Gabrielle,"oh, ellie! hey!"
4981,Gabrielle,maybe this is a mistake. if there's one thing i've learned men can't be trusted.
5489,Gabrielle,okay! okay!i get your point.
5617,Gabrielle,don't be so suicidal.we can always adopt.
5386,Gabrielle,"i have to, uh--"" ""uh, here have some of this. no one needs to know."
7156,Gabrielle,"well, we're not saying that."
4564,Gabrielle,mr. hartley. it's gabrielle solis. i need you to start working on releasing carlos on bail. mm hmm. i just remembered where i put his passport.
4245,Gabrielle,"what? well, then why did you ask for one?"
7822,Gabrielle,"well, how long have you been standing there?"
5209,Gabrielle,"excuse me. hello, david."
8449,Gabrielle,"oh, be nice! there are lots of attractive women on the street."
5179,Gabrielle,the what?
7990,Gabrielle,oh!
6640,Gabrielle,there was no accident. i know you told your chauffeur to ram my car.
6555,Gabrielle,no. moment's gone. you killed it.
7767,Gabrielle,what jug?
7422,Gabrielle,"okay, i'm calling dr. dunlap."
6954,Gabrielle,"god, no. it's a complete snore. pasting a smile on my face while you say the same speech for the fiftieth time?"
8482,Gabrielle,are you sure?
7492,Gabrielle,"there you are! oh, you must be roxy! aren't you the cutest thing! oh! okay, not too close. it's silk."
6658,Gabrielle,you will never be my boyfriend.
4947,Gabrielle,i plan on getting really fat as a tribute to your mother.
4383,Gabrielle,"okay, well, how much did you charge?"
7392,Gabrielle,"i'm so sorry, honey. i-i know this is bad, but we have each other. we'll get married again, and everything will be fine. for richer, for poorer, right?"
4419,Gabrielle,call 911.
7973,Gabrielle,don't talk like that. you want a cheeseburger or something?
6870,Gabrielle,you did?
8421,Gabrielle,not my problem.
5102,Gabrielle,"i feel tons of guilt, so back off."
5320,Gabrielle,"yes, i do."
6030,Gabrielle,no!
4324,Gabrielle,coming!
5046,Gabrielle,"this is ridiculous, you know that?"
8095,Gabrielle,"wow. impressive. huh, carlos?"
6102,Gabrielle,"no, that's how she got crabs. poor bunny. it's always something. if it's not the clap, it's a botched face-lift."
4307,Gabrielle,here we go.
5800,Gabrielle,"oh,that's my little girl.your chakra lining up nice for mommy?that's my girl."
5726,Gabrielle,"oh,honey,he's right,okay.that trashy girl has been lying to us from the get-go.let's just walk away while we can. it's not worth it."
8277,Gabrielle,"oh, that shayla."
5831,Gabrielle,"no, no, no, ma'am,you don't understand.you don't understand,this is our baby!"
8074,Gabrielle,yeah.
8047,Gabrielle,"oh, it's silly. i sold that baseball of yours. but you're right. you can see, and that's all that matters."
7881,Gabrielle,"or--we use birth control, and i'm talking double-bagging, at least until we both decide it's a good idea."
6832,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i'm just gonna say bye to my friend, then i'm gone."
6259,Gabrielle,divorce.
6179,Gabrielle,"that conniving, underhanded snake! thank god i broke into his desk."
8237,Gabrielle,we're ready for dessert now. wrap up ten lobsters to go.
4495,Gabrielle,yes!
7274,Gabrielle,"what, are you crazy?!"
5128,Gabrielle,"actually, the one you gave me is really nice, too."
7605,Gabrielle,"oh, no, thanks. i gotta make sure my handyman gets his wiring done. he screwed it up the last time. you realize we could've had a fire?"
5120,Gabrielle,"oh, my god."
5620,Gabrielle,"what i want is for you to lighten up.we don't have a lot of options, and you're gonna have to pick one."
8674,Gabrielle,"ana, the whole point of chores is that you do them. you don't bat your eyes and call rent-a-horny-kid."
4709,Gabrielle,bigger.
4855,Gabrielle,why not?
7838,Gabrielle,not if she wants to see her favorite dolly alive.
5011,Gabrielle,"when the baby cries in the middle of the night, you're gonna get up without saying one word. doctors' appointments: you're driving. i'm not putting a car seat in my maserati. and you will also be on bottle duty. that means washing, sterilizing, and filling. that way i'll have some semblance of a life, and then maybe i won't hate you so much."
6950,Gabrielle,"well, i'm glad you could join us, milton. it's good to get to know you before the wedding."
7479,Gabrielle,"to answer your earlier question, yes, i got a manicure. i'm sorry. are we good?"
4493,Gabrielle,"okay, you're up first, followed by lynette, uh, and then edie--edie. where's edie britt?"
7335,Gabrielle,i can't deal with that right now. i'm packing.
8444,Gabrielle,"yeah, i do. i spent a night with her right after carlos and i got divorced."
7353,Gabrielle,you just threw my money in a tornado. i am not getting in there with you.
8087,Gabrielle,"come on. you were with a plumber and a housepainter. i mean, let's face it - you like your service providers."
8185,Gabrielle,"honey, we're gonna be us again--the old carlos and gaby. you know what? i'm gonna wear my dress from the night you proposed."
6307,Gabrielle,"well,let me check my book.i might have to move some stuff around,but i think i can swing it."
7444,Gabrielle,"i know you are, babe. and i know it's hard, and i'm gonna try to be more sensitive to your needs. now hurry up and finish. i have to go to the store."
7991,Gabrielle,oh.
8291,Gabrielle,"i know. just keep reminding yourself that we're getting things out of it, too."
7735,Gabrielle,"that was the matre d', wasn't it?"
6720,Gabrielle,aren't they all? so what should i do to make him jealous?
6054,Gabrielle,see you then.
5595,Gabrielle,"oh, this isn't about me.this is about our great nation.and i have no intention of sexually satisfying a man who isn't willing to stand up for and help spread the ideals and values of the united states of america."
4829,Gabrielle,i'll bet.
6865,Gabrielle,okay. i'm sorry i disappointed you. it won't happen again. i better get dressed. i don't want to be late to the victory party.
7962,Gabrielle,"save your breath, carlos. there is no way we're letting grandma screw-loose back into our lives."
4364,Gabrielle,why haven't you returned any of my phone calls?
5538,Gabrielle,i'm sorry.i can't promise that.
5664,Gabrielle,"keeping that in mind,would it also be okay if we were your kids' godparents?"
6356,Gabrielle,i'll get the ball rolling. anybody have a yeast infection?
5715,Gabrielle,"well,my husband and i can expose you to a lot of nice new things."
4522,Gabrielle,here. three weeks in advance.
5050,Gabrielle,"that's ridiculous. you're my husband. i love you. obviously, i would come visit."
6444,Gabrielle,"oh, and tell them what? 9-1-1, somebody broke in the house and left a six thousand dollar dress!"
8025,Gabrielle,"can you see me, babe?"
8078,Gabrielle,"fantastic! well, you didn't sign a contract or anything, did you? 'cause maybe we can get them into a bidding war."
7054,Gabrielle,i can't wait.
7099,Gabrielle,working out.
6815,Gabrielle,i don't believe it. this is an absolute betrayal of our friendship.
6526,Gabrielle,"you researched me? that's sweet! in a, uh, stalkery kind of way. thanks again for a surprisingly enjoyable night. see you around."
4143,Gabrielle,"every time i'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass."
6786,Gabrielle,"well, who is it?"
5000,Gabrielle,they're charging you with a hate crime?
7673,Gabrielle,what's going on?
7700,Gabrielle,"well, come on, then!"
6498,Gabrielle,i won't. but thank you.
4595,Gabrielle,i've gotta go.
6113,Gabrielle,"hey, carlos. what's up?"
5319,Gabrielle,shopping. not that it's any of your business.
5026,Gabrielle,the three of us? how exactly does that benefit carlos?
8445,Gabrielle,is this too red? i think i need something pinky
4198,Gabrielle,"oh, well, don't-- worry about it."
4518,Gabrielle,they took him away in handcuffs.
8243,Gabrielle,"oh, i think i know the kind. so, brad--what sort of bonus are we looking at?"
4604,Gabrielle,john and i made a clean break. i think it's best if we just keep our distance.
8165,Gabrielle,"oh, clothes said that, not me."
4783,Gabrielle,take the plea!
5941,Gabrielle,"the only reason i did this was because i was angry at carlos.now, thanks to you, i'm not angry anymore."
5037,Gabrielle,okay. we're in slightly different situations. but do you wanna get a cup of coffee and talk about it?
7591,Gabrielle,"all right, look, i know we have to do something, but this woman's our friend."
8005,Gabrielle,huh.
7562,Gabrielle,target in place. we're a go.
5252,Gabrielle,it is glorious. i have to have it.
7433,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i think it was a fantastic plan. i mean, there's no way i ever would have figured out that i was married to a permanently blind guy!"
7505,Gabrielle,"do you have any idea how selfish you sound right now? just because you're blind, the world should suffer?"
8393,Gabrielle,"honey, i've played poker with you for the past nine years. i think i can tell when you're bluffing."
7997,Gabrielle,you gonna start that crap again?
7458,Gabrielle,i'm not. my husband is. he's blind.
8577,Gabrielle,"honey, i know you think being pretty seems like the most important thing in the world right now, but believe me, it's not."
7625,Gabrielle,"yeah, think about your son. people live up to the names they're given. if my parents hadn't named me ""gabrielle"", who knows if i'd be this pretty?"
5442,Gabrielle,"the tuba, huh?"
7950,Gabrielle,"uh, look, i'm sorry, but i don't want you driving off with my daughter."
6394,Gabrielle,"that's right, carlos. we have had some pblems with raccoons getting into the trash. so why don't you just put a lid on it?"
6101,Gabrielle,"i mean, that's how bunny connors got chlamydia."
6024,Gabrielle,carlos!
7476,Gabrielle,"i'm sorry. i told you, i had errands to run first."
5934,Gabrielle,"carlos, you promised you'd come home today.well, i don't care what tanaka wants!rattling around this stupid house all by myself is not what i signed up for!no, no, no, don't hang up on me.i'm not done yelling at you!"
6638,Gabrielle,"no, thank you. i'm stuffed."
6767,Gabrielle,standing by my man.
7237,Gabrielle,it's bree.
7984,Gabrielle,"come on. let's get you out of here. let's go. hey, since i'm saving your life and all, you wanna think about maybe keeping us in your will?"
6967,Gabrielle,"as far as i'm concerned, it's just in the nick of time."
7916,Gabrielle,he's giving her orgasms?!
6532,Gabrielle,no! you've paid women for--
8109,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, girls. it's not like he's going off to war. he's gonna be back tomorrow."
7235,Gabrielle,i don't know. i'm taking it one day at a time. but what i can say about victor is he doesn't lie to me about how much money he's got.
5969,Gabrielle,"if you don't tell us, we're not coming."
8343,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, i'm flattered, but i only did that to help susan out."
7821,Gabrielle,honey! what are you doing home? i thought you were at bethany's.
4741,Gabrielle,is that so?
4655,Gabrielle,i wanted to call you. i felt terrible about how we left things.
5431,Gabrielle,"boy, sister mary's done a number on you."
4133,Gabrielle,why don't i just pin the receipt to my chest?
4885,Gabrielle,"well, sam, to tell the truth, i'm kind of in a relationship right now. i just wanted to be honest."
7393,Gabrielle,"the whole nine yards. i'm gonna go down to the cafeteria and get us a couple of ginger ales to toast our future. hey, doctor. he's looking better and better every day. keep up the good work."
6894,Gabrielle,"yeah, on and off. mostly off. what if you tie the knot in a month and realize that you miss ian and mike misses the coma?"
7928,Gabrielle,"oh, shoot. i can't reach it."
4443,Gabrielle,including in the alley? behind the truck stop?
4497,Gabrielle,you really do look fantastic.
4815,Gabrielle,exactly and then you would have blown all the money on the lawyers.
8286,Gabrielle,you painted that? you're good.
6320,Gabrielle,"fine, i may have told a few stories about the old days, but as a warning. i didn't say anything inappropriate for kids."
8614,Gabrielle,now--i just wanna make sure that you're not gonna--you know--
7426,Gabrielle,"i'd say i'm one step ahead of you. i have already slipped into my pink lace teddy, and i'm wearing those whorey pumps that you love."
6364,Gabrielle,"i think i do. you miss your mommy, and it feels funny seeing your daddy be nice to somebody else. but believe me, i'm not trying to replace your mom."
6323,Gabrielle,"okay,just give me a minute.i'm sorry about what i said to the girls,and it won't happen again."
5279,Gabrielle,bree? it's gabby!
6634,Gabrielle,it would be your treat. i'm a hot date. what's in it for me?
7093,Gabrielle,orson.
4812,Gabrielle,"wait, just let me explain."
6182,Gabrielle,hey! cocktails? nobody called me?
5344,Gabrielle,"if it was a boy, i was gonna name it charlie."
7939,Gabrielle,what?
7142,Gabrielle,that's the tension--leaving your body.
8411,Gabrielle,"well, we've never had a drought like this. it's been almost two weeks."
5376,Gabrielle,"so sister mary, tell me what's it like meeting men in prison. do you bond with all the convicts or was carlos just special?"
8573,Gabrielle,"okay, okay, look. i'm sorry. you're right. i never should have asked."
6899,Gabrielle,the hell i don't. those peach tulips belong to you--and so do these.
4330,Gabrielle,"mama solis, how're you doing in there?"
5646,Gabrielle,"oh,nothing,really.carlos and i are gonna go see the adoption counselor today."
6386,Gabrielle,carlos?
5729,Gabrielle,thousand?he's a bouncer in a strip club.offer him eight.
7861,Gabrielle,"put the baby down, carlos."
5330,Gabrielle,ramos. here is one thousand dollars. i won't tell carlos you didn't stick around. it'll be our little secret.
7736,Gabrielle,which we're not on.
4332,Gabrielle,"well,maybe i made a mistake."
6353,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, it's totally my fault. i'm sorry, sweetie. go outside and do it again. i promise this time we're gonna watch."
8491,Gabrielle,"ugh, and i have a garden club meeting."
7969,Gabrielle,virginia. what are you doing here?
6314,Gabrielle,"but before they do, they kill your appetite. one time, there was a girl who took too many laxatives, and, uh--well, if you're ever at the chateau milan in room two thirty-eight, do not use the jacuzzi."
7268,Gabrielle,"and tell them what, i knocked my husband overboard because he was coming after me with a sweater? no, come on. we gotta go back out there."
7174,Gabrielle,"uh, okay. you know that old friend i ran into in the lobby? it might have been john rowland. maybe. i'm not sure."
5181,Gabrielle,shaky at best.
5241,Gabrielle,"not an option. i'm catholic, hence the guilt."
5370,Gabrielle,really? when did they start doing that?
5919,Gabrielle,barefoot?
6862,Gabrielle,he was mean. he deserved it.
5512,Gabrielle,"well,when you left prison,did they leave you a contact list?"
6630,Gabrielle,"five? well, sure, i guess."
8616,Gabrielle,good to know. because gambling is bad enough without being high.
5144,Gabrielle,"you were about to turn me down, then you reconsidered once you realized i was gonna throw a ton of money at you. which i am."
7912,Gabrielle,"no, but i just think we should end things before they get any weirder."
7508,Gabrielle,put flags on pencils and sell them at the airport. what do i care? just get out of my kitchen--whoa. what is this about?
6155,Gabrielle,i'm what?!
4541,Gabrielle,"hey, how creepy is mrs. huber's sister?"
5615,Gabrielle,"okay,you can think she's charming.but don't forget for one second that she is a monster."
5568,Gabrielle,"you made me a promise, carlos,a long time ago--till death do us part.and one day you just come home and start throwing words around like annulment.how do you think that makes me feel?"
7401,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know, but i'm no good single. honestly, i don't know how you do it."
7957,Gabrielle,we're done here. good bye.
7911,Gabrielle,maybe a little too much.
6061,Gabrielle,yeah!
6775,Gabrielle,i don't know my own strength..
5039,Gabrielle,here it is in black and white. it's your kid. what? why aren't you smiling?
5090,Gabrielle,this isn't about that.
4521,Gabrielle,"yao lin, your kids are in their twenties. if it'll make you shut up--"
6665,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
7466,Gabrielle,"no, no, no, no, no. wait! okay, you know what? this is getting ridiculous."
4672,Gabrielle,he has a lot of anger toward the government right now and he's just dying to find someone to take it out on.
4205,Gabrielle,"oh, it's a rose."
5137,Gabrielle,he called me a bitch.
6213,Gabrielle,your terms?
5016,Gabrielle,"anyway, he was placed under house arrest, and he being the jealous man that he is, got a little crazy every time i left the house."
7119,Gabrielle,"night, carlos."
4780,Gabrielle,"oh, that's it. i cannot be a part of this! i can't do it!"
7096,Gabrielle,"okay, when has anyone ever used a poem as a clue?"
5207,Gabrielle,are you sure?
8326,Gabrielle,"you know, jody, i really don't think this is the time or place to discuss gory details."
5459,Gabrielle,"oh, come here,you sweet little thing."
5103,Gabrielle,i apologized a million times.
5947,Gabrielle,but who has the ring?
4141,Gabrielle,you can't order me around like i'm a child!
7372,Gabrielle,yeah--
5828,Gabrielle,so?!
5843,Gabrielle,"oh,no,no,xiao-mei,you're not going anywhere.hey,you're much too important to carlos and me."
8305,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes, you bleached blonde twit. i'm not talking about me. i'm talking about you and bradley."
7965,Gabrielle,"right, and in exchange, when she finally kicks the bucket, we wind up with a lamp. i'm sorry, carlos."
7614,Gabrielle,we weren't expecting you back so soon.
7792,Gabrielle,"i used to be. look at my life, susan. i--i've been beaten down."
6367,Gabrielle,what about your dad? don't you care what he wants?
4656,Gabrielle,okay but -
5653,Gabrielle,really?
5451,Gabrielle,okay.
8596,Gabrielle,fran schulman? fran. it's gabrielle solis from the tennis club.
7910,Gabrielle,"and it never will, because if you think i'm gonna let you drag carlos off to europe, you're nuts."
5178,Gabrielle,about time.
6580,Gabrielle,date's over. what do you want?
8191,Gabrielle,"now don't forget, the clasp is broken."
7671,Gabrielle,police! police! get in here now!
6017,Gabrielle,perfect.
6914,Gabrielle,practically in tears over this whole wedding date thing.
5750,Gabrielle,shh. in a minute.
7856,Gabrielle,"well, i wish he'd stop doing that. nobody likes a fickle god."
4287,Gabrielle,wow.
5898,Gabrielle,"yeah, sure,knock yourself out."
8517,Gabrielle,"i was gonna say ""die of gonorrhea,"""
6769,Gabrielle,i said yes. i would be thrilled to be mrs. victor lang.
4762,Gabrielle,what?
4195,Gabrielle,"it's not exciting anymore, carlos."
6452,Gabrielle,he's here.
4804,Gabrielle,"i'm so lucky to have you,"
6751,Gabrielle,you! blackmailer!
8101,Gabrielle,"hang on. before you do that, let me lay it out for you. either you let your family continue to sacrifice so you can feel good about yourself, or you grow up and make real money and look after us like we've been looking after you for the past five years."
6525,Gabrielle,when did i say that?
6838,Gabrielle,forty dollars? you think i'm gonna pay that?
8568,Gabrielle,"oh, that doesn't really go with my skin tone."
8368,Gabrielle,where did that come from?
6961,Gabrielle,"oh. okay, well, let's explore it now. nope, not gonna happen."
7271,Gabrielle,"well, i thought you were trying to kill me."
5452,Gabrielle,okay.
5875,Gabrielle,oh!
6636,Gabrielle,"well, a girl's gotta eat."
6090,Gabrielle,"we got ties here, people! designer ties, two for a dollar! ooh, do you like those barbells? make me an offer. i'm feeling generous. here's the customer i've been waiting for."
6893,Gabrielle,you are rushing into this marriage thing way too fast. why don't you give it some time and see if you and me work as a couple?
7252,Gabrielle,"no, that's impossible. he hasn't said a word. in fact, i've never seen him so sweet and attentive."
7379,Gabrielle,"okay. all right, you look very tired, so i'm just gonna go."
5681,Gabrielle,"right, uh, lots of love.honey, can i talk to you for a second?"
7259,Gabrielle,i'm not?
5439,Gabrielle,"oh, honey. i'm so sorry. oh, maybe that stupid nun is right. maybe i am trying to stop you from becoming a better person. it's just that i love you the way you are, greedy, selfish, and insensitive. i'm just scared if you're not those things anymore, you're gonna wake up one day and realize i still am, and then you won't want me."
7137,Gabrielle,yeah.
5029,Gabrielle,she doesn't look that busy to me.
6505,Gabrielle,you bribed the judges?
5047,Gabrielle,don't you think i have better things to do than to bring you checks every day? checks that i could be signing at home?
4994,Gabrielle,they're charging you with a hate crime?
7101,Gabrielle,all right. ready? get set--go.
7756,Gabrielle,"yeah, about that price--you're gonna have to drop it. i mean, look at all these dents."
5429,Gabrielle,"carlos, you can't do this. you can't just go to africa."
6973,Gabrielle,fine. i get it. but why would i want a husband who values his father's opinion more than mine?
6125,Gabrielle,"no, if i wanted to hurt you, i would tell you about last weekend when i slept with john rowland."
5513,Gabrielle,"good morning,luis,ralph."
8219,Gabrielle,are you out of mind? i have two sleeping children.
5014,Gabrielle,"your honor, this whole mess is just a result of my loneliness. my marriage is a bit strained, and after carlos was convicted-"
8238,Gabrielle,"oh, put it on and have a good time. turns out i'm no gonna be able to afford it right now--unless you can help me out on the price."
7412,Gabrielle,"okay, he's gone. what's up?"
5411,Gabrielle,i was just about to ask you the same thing. you were supposed to meet me at the spa.
4630,Gabrielle,"you know, i never thought i'd say this but i kind of feel sorry for paul."
5634,Gabrielle,"the only reason she offered up her dusty womb is because she's screwed.her latest sugar daddy gave her the boot,so mom needs a place to stay and money.so trust me,if she carried our child,we'd be footing the bill for years."
7882,Gabrielle,"and until we get a box of condoms in that house, that's all you're gettin'."
5323,Gabrielle,he thought i was cheating with two gay guys. are you sure you want to go with perceptive?
7057,Gabrielle,it's good. are you cold? they keep it cold in here.
6615,Gabrielle,"zach, a real man is honest. all you've ever tried to do is bribe and trick me into falling in love with you. a little advice next time: don't play games. just stand up and be the kind of man a woman would be proud to share her life with."
7556,Gabrielle,"okay, there may be two tramps in this house, but only one of 'em is getting paid."
8298,Gabrielle,i need a fresh look. i've been going through some pretty intense personal stuff lately.
4969,Gabrielle,"because carlos can provide, john! he can give this baby everything. piano lessons and summer camp and the best colleges. he can raise this child the way it deserves to be raised, you can't."
7011,Gabrielle,so i hear congratulations are in order.edie just announced you're getting married.best wishes!
6850,Gabrielle,thank you. now what you're about to see may astound you.
4566,Gabrielle,"well, we're not negotiating my uterus."
5333,Gabrielle,"you don't have a door handle, either."
4789,Gabrielle,you are so brave.
4219,Gabrielle,absolutely!
8601,Gabrielle,i'll explain it to him later.
8172,Gabrielle,i sort of do. now let's play some poker.
6733,Gabrielle,exactly. going down. . .
5240,Gabrielle,there are some ground rules first. i'm not leaving my husband. carlos is looking at spending eight years in jail because of my lapse of judgment with the gardener. i can't let him rot in there. i'd be filled with guilt.
7301,Gabrielle,fine. i'll go.
6181,Gabrielle,"i know how carlos thinks. more importantly, what he thinks with."
5650,Gabrielle,"wow,did you smell the alcohol on her breath?"
6683,Gabrielle,"okay, you're mad, so i'm just gonna blow right by that slut crack."
6690,Gabrielle,why don't you just tell tom to pick another color?
7382,Gabrielle,excuse me. are you al's wife? i'm gabrielle lang.
6151,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no, let's get something straight. you and i are not gonna have sex tonight."
7289,Gabrielle,of course.
4372,Gabrielle,"not that long, why?"" ""carlos, what is it?"
5936,Gabrielle,what's so funny?
6724,Gabrielle,"hey, you hurt me. if i have to strike back hard to protect myself--"
5708,Gabrielle,"well,first of all,i'm gonna show her one of our tax returns.once she sees how much money we have,i have a hunch we're gonna look a whole lot whiter."
5416,Gabrielle,she wants us fighting. she wants you to get tired of me and walk out so she can have you all to herself.
7160,Gabrielle,"brett, when's the last time a cable guy waited for anyone? i see a lot of lawn mowing in your future. hey, it's me again. you're not gonna believe this. before victor left on his business trip, he hired someone to tail me."
4462,Gabrielle,"listen, betty! okay? you're not quitting on me now. we're going to find you a gown. it's going to be black, and slimming, and you're going to look great! i need you to be brave now."
6227,Gabrielle,you recorded our lovemaking?
4645,Gabrielle,"well, then what did you hire me for?"
8378,Gabrielle,"say, ""how do i thank you, greatest friend in the world? what's your birthstone?"""
4484,Gabrielle,"it's just sex, it's totally harmless."
4137,Gabrielle,hi susan.
4687,Gabrielle,i am here to talk to your roommate.
6797,Gabrielle,"we, you should, 'cause they do."
6651,Gabrielle,"no. god, no. as a matter of fact, i think i'm dumping him after dinner tonight."
5194,Gabrielle,"david, we're not here to drink wine, okay? this is business. now you have to convince carlos that he can trust you."
6800,Gabrielle,"edie, there are a thousand single men in fairview. why do you have to date my ex-husband?"
8457,Gabrielle,"now, now, edie. don't be snarky. we're both hot, remember? although, apparently, i'm just a little bit hotter."
8329,Gabrielle,were your coworkers. bradley fired you. remember?
6667,Gabrielle,"shh! they can hear you. oh, my god! there's another rack back here! this all your ex-wife's stuff?"
5028,Gabrielle,"well, up until the point that you told my husband we were having an affair, i was quite fond of you. since then, not a fan!"
8673,Gabrielle,"uh, okay, juanita, go to your room. and don't come out until you're 18."
7870,Gabrielle,because he and lee are here. bob's an attorney. i'm gonna get him to sue the quack who obviously botched your vasectomy.
4222,Gabrielle,"gorgeous, thankful we have 49 cards to play with."
4197,Gabrielle,hello jonathan.
5727,Gabrielle,you said we could give her gifts.everybody loves getting cash.
7084,Gabrielle,"edie---she's wearing a big, honkin' engagement ring the size of a peach pit."
6462,Gabrielle,i would not feel comfortable meeting for dinner.
6923,Gabrielle,press? at our wedding?
7019,Gabrielle,affair?i thought we were talking about runng away together.
5762,Gabrielle,"look,just buckle up!"
8071,Gabrielle,why? you need someone?
6793,Gabrielle,"but once they defrost the body and do an autopsy, i guarantee you they're gonna find a bellyful of arsenic."
5665,Gabrielle,"great,and can we take some fake pictures to document it?"
8222,Gabrielle,"well, frankly, some of them need it. i just came for a little remodel, and there are some real teardowns out there."
7929,Gabrielle,"no, we're good."
6783,Gabrielle,"he is, and i've never been happier."
6855,Gabrielle,no!
5571,Gabrielle,"i think that's the right decision.you know,i made a decision, too.the answer to your question earlier is yes."
4171,Gabrielle,"it's open, what's the big deal?"
8528,Gabrielle,"hey, don't snap at me. lynette's my friend. i was just watching her back."
7204,Gabrielle,milton-- you scared me. i thought you were in washington with victor.
8506,Gabrielle,"patty, do you mind if i steal tom for a sec?"
8297,Gabrielle,"well, shaylait is shayla, right?"
7403,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. we bumped into each other a few months ago, and we just fell in love all over again."
8048,Gabrielle,"yeah, but it's just a thing. we don't care about things."
8576,Gabrielle,"hey. i know i disappointed you tonight, and i'm really sorry."
4888,Gabrielle,aren't they gorgeous?
5308,Gabrielle,"well, let's get you another round."
8075,Gabrielle,"so long, sucka."
7163,Gabrielle,"as soon as we get around the corner, we're gonna have to adjust this horn."
4716,Gabrielle,and how much is this gonna cost?
5171,Gabrielle,"no, it's his foot."
6884,Gabrielle,i'm kind of in the middle of something.
5671,Gabrielle,will you shut up?
5236,Gabrielle,what?
4267,Gabrielle,try to hurry. i have stuff to do.
8677,Gabrielle,of what?
6836,Gabrielle,"oh, give me a break. i was standing right there. you could've said something."
4315,Gabrielle,come on! i said i was sorry.
4681,Gabrielle,i don't know. he's not here. he had a meeting with his lawyer.
5686,Gabrielle,"fine. just know that in a couple of days,when that thing is born,and you're gonna have to cuddle and snuggle up with something with that face on it, don't come crying to me."
5400,Gabrielle,"what the hell kind of nun are you? look, if you try to come between me and my husband, i will take you down."
6405,Gabrielle,"you need to move on, carlos."
4889,Gabrielle,sorry.
7993,Gabrielle,"but i'm not most women. i was an international fashion model, and that's how carlos remembers me."
6931,Gabrielle,"well, i gotta go. i'm gonna meet francois."
8057,Gabrielle,what? we can't afford this.
4726,Gabrielle,i've been to bree's twice today.
6868,Gabrielle,i think so.
7583,Gabrielle,"oh, on his-- got it. does it hurt?"
8046,Gabrielle,really? that makes me feel so much better. you wouldn't believe all the stupid things i've been worried about.
5721,Gabrielle,wow. you're a lot smarter than i thought.
